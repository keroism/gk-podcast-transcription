00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,540
Rym: It's Monday April 16th 2018 I'm Rym.

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,567
Rym: I'm just gonna and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:15,788 --> 00:00:18,368
Rym: We are talking about destroying data.

4
00:00:21,032 --> 00:00:22,023
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:24,213 --> 00:00:31,190
Rym: So I had a co-worker who was in town from London this week And I got to tell him that he basically got to experience the entirety of New York spring.

6
00:00:32,052 --> 00:00:37,368
Rym: okay, cuz It feels like this has only been happening in the last three years.

7
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:39,388
Rym: But I feel like every year.

8
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:46,077
Rym: It's just like winter and then suddenly it's 80 degrees and then it goes like a little bit And then it's just summer.

9
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,990
Scott: everyone talks about climate change, right?

10
00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:48,774
Scott: Oh, it's get the.

11
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:51,690
Scott: you know, the average temperature of the world is getting warmer, right?

12
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,850
Scott: Well, that's not been my experience.

13
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,339
Scott: My experience is simply that we did.

14
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,510
Scott: the start and end of the seasons has been shifted later, right?

15
00:00:58,751 --> 00:01:00,816
Rym: It's not just that the summer star selves are.

16
00:01:00,876 --> 00:01:06,209
Scott: summer starts later and it goes longer and then winter starts later and goes longer.

17
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,019
Scott: So really just the season moved.

18
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:09,910
Scott: they got pushed ahead in the year.

19
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:14,210
Scott: They don't line up with the months in the same way, but it's not that it is not extreme.

20
00:01:14,973 --> 00:01:23,118
Scott: the changes are more extreme on a day-to-day point is is that it's cold and Even though other people say climate change is bad.

21
00:01:23,138 --> 00:01:28,149
Scott: I feel like I want to burn more coal until it's you know 80-degrees every day.

22
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:29,913
Rym: He's called.

23
00:01:29,953 --> 00:01:31,339
Rym: they want their stand-up routine bad.

24
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:33,910
Scott: I'm just saying I want it's cold.

25
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:38,266
Rym: I'm not happy but I can say that because I ski.

26
00:01:38,286 --> 00:01:43,050
Rym: so I thought I'd like the Nuances of weather like yeah, we should burn coal until no one can ski anymore.

27
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:48,230
Scott: Well actually save lives even though the the the bad weather will kill some people.

28
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:51,861
Rym: I think the bad weather already kills more people than skiing ever has key.

29
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:54,569
Scott: people will not be able to ski and will does be saved.

30
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:56,736
Rym: Plus we can ski indoors.

31
00:01:57,279 --> 00:01:58,263
Rym: They're skiing in Dubai.

32
00:01:58,565 --> 00:02:00,875
Scott: That's safer than Skiing on a mountain?

33
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:09,229
Rym: probably not because no there's no trees and rocks and indoor skiing Yeah, but indoor skiing is pretty much only people who don't know how to ski which is the primary source of ski injuries.

34
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:11,261
Rym: People who don't know how to ski skiing.

35
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:15,716
Rym: Mm-hmm, but So it got crazy hot.

36
00:02:16,418 --> 00:02:18,183
Rym: but oh, yes, I was getting my wasn't crazy hot.

37
00:02:18,223 --> 00:02:20,830
Scott: It was slightly chilly relative slightly chilly.

38
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,438
Scott: It was 79 degrees slightly chilly.

39
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:25,766
Rym: I think you've just turned into an old man.

40
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:26,930
Rym: I think you're permanently there.

41
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:29,082
Rym: You're your old man thermal when you're.

42
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:30,850
Rym: what are you gonna do when you're 90?

43
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,710
Rym: It has to be like a hundred and ten or you're freezing putting on a sweater.

44
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,390
Scott: Well, all the people who are currently in Florida who are no good will be dead because I'm younger than them.

45
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,389
Scott: So now I can move to Florida and perfectly fine.

46
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:42,741
Scott: But Florida will know all the Florida men will be dead by then.

47
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:47,465
Rym: if I fly in Florida will suddenly be a good place And I fly out west or go way north.

48
00:02:47,546 --> 00:02:48,050
Rym: I can just ski.

49
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,813
Rym: It doesn't really matter.

50
00:02:48,893 --> 00:03:01,416
Rym: but in terms of like upstate New York, Vermont, New Hampshire skiing The difference of even a couple degrees a month like a month and a half or so in either direction drastically changes everything.

51
00:03:01,436 --> 00:03:13,263
Rym: and I can definitely say that the last three years have been very difficult ski seasons because we're just over that threshold for at least like Upstate New York and edging into parts of New Hampshire in Vermont.

52
00:03:13,364 --> 00:03:17,937
Scott: No, I don't give a shit is good for me For now till New York floods Inflated today.

53
00:03:17,957 --> 00:03:19,365
Scott: Yeah, I was fine.

54
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:20,009
Scott: I'm on the third floor.

55
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:27,534
Rym: the funniest thing about that is that I got the alert and of course my phone doesn't make noise because I'm an adult but Pretty much.

56
00:03:27,755 --> 00:03:40,283
Rym: I'm on this floor with like thousand plus other people so all morning Every like five minutes someone's phone would make that D Emergency alert sound and then you get this scattered delay as one by one.

57
00:03:40,383 --> 00:03:41,527
Rym: Everyone's phone makes the noise.

58
00:03:41,547 --> 00:03:51,425
Rym: Mm-hmm I think the only person on earth or just keeps their phone always in vibrate mode no matter what when there's a Another when there's a real emergency that actually warrants the use of that system.

59
00:03:51,445 --> 00:03:52,710
Scott: then what's gonna happen?

60
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:58,142
Scott: It'll vibrate and I'll know cuz I knew anyway I'm it on your floor of a thousand people.

61
00:03:58,424 --> 00:04:03,125
Scott: It'll go D D the same thing and then everyone looks at their phone and then what?

62
00:04:03,386 --> 00:04:04,250
Rym: and then they do whatever.

63
00:04:04,832 --> 00:04:08,106
Rym: Whatever the thing says so far all the things said was parts of Queens.

64
00:04:08,126 --> 00:04:08,990
Rym: They don't care about flooded.

65
00:04:09,951 --> 00:04:12,580
Rym: Stay off the stay off the highways on the edges of Manhattan.

66
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,610
Scott: Yeah, what's it gonna say when I live in Manhattan surrounded by fire?

67
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,055
Rym: I feel like at that point.

68
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:22,410
Rym: I'm already on my bike with the rabbits in a backpack like making my way out of town.

69
00:04:22,493 --> 00:04:24,091
Scott: You're not You're.

70
00:04:24,152 --> 00:04:24,874
Scott: you're not gonna make it through.

71
00:04:24,894 --> 00:04:27,041
Rym: the firewall depends on how high that firewall is.

72
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:28,706
Rym: the Staten Island Bridge is pretty high.

73
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:29,830
Rym: the Arizona Narrows.

74
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,949
Scott: You're on Manhattan and you're inside the fire ring.

75
00:04:33,912 --> 00:04:34,995
Rym: How tall is the fire ring?

76
00:04:35,256 --> 00:04:40,210
Rym: is it over the Queensborough Bridge because if it's not I could walk over the top of the Queensborough Bridge.

77
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:40,777
Rym: There's a little pad.

78
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:41,648
Scott: there you get cooked.

79
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,560
Rym: Depends depends on how hot this fire is.

80
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,349
Scott: the bridge is gonna be a nice grill.

81
00:04:48,253 --> 00:04:52,130
Rym: We get some Rym egg and cheese or I'll walk through the East River tunnel.

82
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:55,559
Rym: Fire's not in there and outside.

83
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:56,462
Scott: That's a good idea.

84
00:04:56,482 --> 00:04:58,630
Scott: Yeah, you'll get I got plans for everything.

85
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:02,415
Rym: Yeah Scott has a pretty good news.

86
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:03,739
Scott: What's all my news?

87
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,916
Scott: Oh, yeah, so we talked about a lot about Internet of things and how.

88
00:05:08,936 --> 00:05:12,890
Scott: you know, there's a lot of terms going on these days like cloud and Internet of Things.

89
00:05:12,954 --> 00:05:14,320
Scott: Yeah we also have a cloud.

90
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:16,775
Scott: actually just means someone else's computer.

91
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:19,043
Scott: if you ever see an article with the use of the word cloud.

92
00:05:19,063 --> 00:05:19,324
Scott: a lot.

93
00:05:19,364 --> 00:05:23,999
Scott: replace every instance of cloud with Someone else's computer and it will make perfect sense.

94
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:24,440
Scott: That's all.

95
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,363
Scott: cloud is right.

96
00:05:25,764 --> 00:05:29,804
Scott: Internet of Things simply means Thing that doesn't look like a computer.

97
00:05:29,845 --> 00:05:30,630
Scott: That is a computer.

98
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:45,544
Scott: Yep, for example, if you have one of those refrigerators with a screen on it and whatever guess what that refrigerator is a computer and If it happens to connect to the internet There's a lot of computers that don't connect to the internet right like your car is a computer or

99
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:47,794
Rym: like the computer in Mission Impossible One

100
00:05:48,136 --> 00:05:50,029
Scott: right is a computer doesn't connect to the internet.

101
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:59,243
Scott: But if you have a computer in a thing that normally doesn't look like a computer But it connects to the internet now you have Internet of Things.

102
00:05:59,524 --> 00:06:01,712
Scott: right computers hidden in places You didn't know

103
00:06:01,853 --> 00:06:14,110
Rym: usually gets a little more nuanced and that almost now I'd say 99% of the time people specifically mean Something that does a physical thing in the real world like tracks the food in your fridge or lets you turn off a light.

104
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,544
Scott: Right, but you know, it's a smart TV is Internet of Things.

105
00:06:17,605 --> 00:06:22,524
Scott: Yeah, it's it's a computer That's that's your TV now has a computer attached to it hidden inside.

106
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:29,510
Rym: because as a technology professional What Internet of Things means to me is that thing does not get updates, right?

107
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,614
Scott: It's basically a device.

108
00:06:30,855 --> 00:06:34,790
Scott: right and this is the main problem with them is you have basically full-on computers.

109
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,733
Scott: They got CPUs.

110
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:36,776
Scott: They got RAM.

111
00:06:36,817 --> 00:06:37,900
Rym: They're connected to your Wi-Fi.

112
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,754
Scott: probably really as long as you have a CPU RAM and a network card That's enough.

113
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:44,104
Scott: Yeah that to do damage and a power source.

114
00:06:44,425 --> 00:06:45,510
Scott: That's enough to do damage.

115
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:50,304
Scott: Yeah, any CPU with RAM and a network card can now do evil.

116
00:06:50,405 --> 00:06:52,190
Scott: it can send spam emails.

117
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,470
Scott: It can attempt to hack other computers.

118
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:59,690
Rym: It could turn your light switch on and off again so rapidly that it literally starts a fire in your house.

119
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:00,153
Scott: It gets.

120
00:07:00,193 --> 00:07:03,313
Scott: try to send SSH, you know Connections.

121
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,143
Scott: it can do anything that a CPU can do which is all the things.

122
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:06,244
Scott: well.

123
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:13,970
Rym: So if you do anything that can be accomplished by some combination of adding ones and zeros together, right?

124
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,030
Scott: So like those fancy thermostats people have or what else?

125
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:22,283
Rym: The secure those malware mail me one Bitcoin or the temperature was up by one degree per hour.

126
00:07:22,363 --> 00:07:27,057
Rym: the garage door openers with Wi-Fi They only one Bitcoin or I break your car right.

127
00:07:27,258 --> 00:07:36,798
Scott: all these sorts of devices that have an internet connection in a CPU and RAM hidden in them are Computers that are not being properly taken care of.

128
00:07:36,858 --> 00:07:45,183
Scott: the people who have them don't recognize them as computers and if you connect them To the Internet somebody can Hijack them connect to them use them in ways.

129
00:07:45,223 --> 00:07:46,470
Scott: They weren't intended to be used.

130
00:07:46,891 --> 00:07:49,338
Scott: You know your garage, you're literally not even a joke.

131
00:07:49,378 --> 00:07:59,350
Scott: your garage door opener could be made to like send spams or Host child porn on its meager storage or who knows what yep mine mine bitcoins.

132
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:06,290
Rym: So there's a concept that's a little deeper than a firewall because a firewall is just some rules around the network traffic.

133
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:10,794
Rym: But the computer on the other side is still connected to the network Like it's.

134
00:08:10,814 --> 00:08:16,207
Rym: still two people are connecting to it effectively directly to do stuff Unless you have a fancy like layer 7 firewall.

135
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:21,105
Rym: But the air gap is an important concept in IT security.

136
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:32,184
Rym: if something is so important that Like it's serious like capital s serious Usually those are systems that are not connected to the internet at all.

137
00:08:32,326 --> 00:08:32,506
Rym: Yep.

138
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:38,450
Rym: There is no path There is no IP anywhere that will get between that computer and the internet.

139
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,720
Scott: yep, like in RIT we had this.

140
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:44,280
Scott: I took a computer security class and You nothing.

141
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:53,370
Scott: in that lab in that room there's a bunch of racks and a whole bunch of tables with like patches on them and All these desktops in there in that room at all the at all the desks.

142
00:08:53,611 --> 00:08:56,402
Scott: Oh, but there was no internet connection in that room.

143
00:08:56,462 --> 00:09:04,250
Scott: if we wanted to bring software into the room We had to go outside with a USB stick load it up bring it in USB stick son.

144
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,938
Rym: I used a zip disk for that.

145
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,595
Scott: I used USB sticks because it was 2004 or whatever it was.

146
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:11,418
Rym: Yeah, I was.

147
00:09:11,438 --> 00:09:11,920
Rym: I took that.

148
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,726
Rym: collect the collect the equivalent class in 2000.

149
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:18,530
Scott: Yeah The point is we had to bring software from the outside, right?

150
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:27,599
Scott: Yeah It's like the Mission Impossible computer or say the computer that already a lot of times you just bring laptops in Already loaded and put like the computer that launches nukes.

151
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:35,229
Rym: even if you have the best internet security and firewalls on earth It's probably safer to just not actually have a connection to it.

152
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:45,629
Scott: Anyway, so I you know, usually practically speaking this usually comes up in casual conversation because I can tell people hey You shouldn't be getting those, you know boxes, you know connected to your TV.

153
00:09:45,911 --> 00:09:49,858
Scott: You should be getting an HD PC that you can update and has real software You should not be getting.

154
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:55,690
Scott: if you have a smart TV Don't connect it to the internet and don't use any of the smart features get an HD PC, right?

155
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,790
Scott: This is the usual conversation we have because I'm talking about the insecurity of internet of things stuff.

156
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,944
Scott: Right because those you know that you're not getting software updates.

157
00:10:03,964 --> 00:10:05,350
Scott: You don't know what the hell software is on there.

158
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,595
Scott: You've connected it to your network.

159
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:09,646
Scott: You're putting everything at risk connecting some strange computer to your network.

160
00:10:10,248 --> 00:10:11,774
Scott: But here we go We have a real story.

161
00:10:11,814 --> 00:10:12,677
Scott: This really happened.

162
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:13,581
Scott: It's not sci-fi.

163
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:14,645
Scott: It's not some example.

164
00:10:14,665 --> 00:10:15,930
Scott: Well, it is an example.

165
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:16,975
Scott: It's a real example.

166
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:18,623
Scott: this thing actually fucking happened.

167
00:10:19,366 --> 00:10:26,230
Scott: some casino Had in the fish tank that was at the front of the casino as a decoration because you know casinos got fancy decorations.

168
00:10:26,411 --> 00:10:32,790
Scott: Yeah, a internet controlled thermometer thermostat thing to control and monitor the temperature in the fish tank.

169
00:10:33,311 --> 00:10:36,440
Scott: But this wasn't just a thermometer like mercury and a stick.

170
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,910
Scott: it was a computer with an internet connection that connected to where the Wi-Fi.

171
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,034
Scott: Yeah, right.

172
00:10:41,757 --> 00:10:43,061
Scott: You just don't think of it as a computer.

173
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:45,410
Scott: You just you know, you think of it as fucking thermometer.

174
00:10:45,992 --> 00:10:57,950
Scott: So, of course somebody hijacked that and now that's a computer that was on the casinos computer network And they went in through that very insecure thermostat connected to the casinos other computers that had real things.

175
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:12,429
Rym: I didn't look up the details of this particular Thermostat but generally the reason why these are never things things are so dangerous and even these contacts is that you connect it to your Internal network, but it's not directly accessible from the outside kind of like with Skype back in the day.

176
00:11:12,932 --> 00:11:16,990
Rym: These these Internet of Things devices have to work when idiots are involved.

177
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:22,894
Rym: So they are good at net busting and getting out to the internet to connect to some server somewhere To do their biz.

178
00:11:22,914 --> 00:11:36,670
Scott: a lot of them are like these, you know, like for example the NAS I have you know Synology, yeah, it's like it connects to like this Synology stuff That's way out on the real internet like to help you if you don't know how to do land stuff in your house.

179
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,182
Rym: Yeah, that shit's all turned off on mine.

180
00:11:38,202 --> 00:11:43,286
Scott: Yeah, exactly It's like you can go to find that Synology calm and then it helps you.

181
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:46,462
Scott: that thing That's on the real internet helps you find something on your land.

182
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:51,322
Scott: It's like no no land only We're not having my NAS that's on my local network.

183
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:52,930
Scott: Talk to anything else outside.

184
00:11:53,131 --> 00:12:03,670
Scott: So people will install these Internet of Things things on an internal secure network like web like someone will set up a webcam Those the worst security webcam and then in order to see what the webcam sees you go to a website.

185
00:12:03,851 --> 00:12:06,570
Scott: That's on the public internet and now everyone can see everything that's it going on.

186
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:11,529
Scott: Yes, and even you didn't open as opposed to connecting directly to it from you know, wherever you are.

187
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:21,984
Rym: Yep So if anything on that server that web thing that's letting this webcam do its thing is compromised at all You can get into the webcam and do whatever on the internal network.

188
00:12:22,024 --> 00:12:23,390
Scott: someone used this thermometer.

189
00:12:23,732 --> 00:12:26,165
Scott: They hijacked at that and then now they're on that.

190
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:27,030
Scott: they had a connection.

191
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:36,561
Scott: They were able to browse the casinos internal computer network and they found a database that was not so secure and that database had all Info about all the high rollers in the casinos.

192
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:37,183
Scott: Yeah.

193
00:12:37,444 --> 00:12:38,870
Rym: Okay, this is fun stuff.

194
00:12:39,111 --> 00:12:53,397
Rym: now this is not the crazier exploits that people in talking about about using To get at completely air gap systems meaning has nothing to do with it now, but that's a similar but more Interesting story.

195
00:12:53,458 --> 00:13:00,807
Scott: there are ways, you know, depending on what's going on You can try to hack into systems that aren't connected to the internet, but it's extremely difficult.

196
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:04,170
Scott: Yeah point is There are things that are computers.

197
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:09,039
Scott: You need to be able to recognize what is and what is not a computer and in the future Everything is a computer.

198
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:20,138
Scott: if something is a computer do not put it on your network unless you have somehow separated it or something and Make sure you you know don't let it connect it if it doesn't have to.

199
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:27,369
Scott: you can get one of those internet connectable garage door openers and never Connect it to the internet and just open your enclosure garage door without any Wi-Fi.

200
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:36,830
Rym: yep, or if you're gonna use its internet stuff at least put it on a Segregated Wi-Fi network that doesn't have any access to the rest of your network.

201
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:38,017
Scott: Yeah, and then it's like, okay.

202
00:13:38,057 --> 00:13:39,989
Scott: Well, here's this thing on its own this smart TV.

203
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:43,643
Scott: It might start sending spam to the internet and does whatever.

204
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,470
Scott: the worst it can do is use my bandwidth.

205
00:13:45,631 --> 00:13:48,885
Scott: It can't hurt anything any of my other real computers or anything.

206
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:50,090
Scott: It's all on its own.

207
00:13:50,191 --> 00:13:53,910
Scott: It might as well have its own private internet connection that it shares with nothing else.

208
00:13:54,432 --> 00:13:59,810
Scott: And if it becomes horrible and using my bandwidth then I'll disconnect it and I can take advantage of its features in the meantime.

209
00:14:00,551 --> 00:14:03,868
Scott: So in some other news, but ideally just don't connect it in the first place you want the problem.

210
00:14:03,948 --> 00:14:04,089
Scott: Yep.

211
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:07,280
Rym: So in some other news, I just saw this story.

212
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,150
Rym: I remember seeing some rumblings about this and it's kind of interesting.

213
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,655
Rym: I'm gonna summarize to.

214
00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:21,887
Rym: the details are pretty technical and they rely on some understanding of the plain old Television set like the plain old television the plain old telephony networks like old phone pots.

215
00:14:22,248 --> 00:14:22,950
Rym: Yeah pots.

216
00:14:23,912 --> 00:14:42,256
Rym: so basically the way phones like phone calls work in the US is actually very well defined and modern internet-based telephony largely fakes a lot of that stuff or Translates between that stuff.

217
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:56,590
Rym: So like for example in the old days if you picked up a phone and by the old days I mean like the 90s and you called someone on the phone Like you picked up a landline if you've ever seen one of those people and yet rotary dialed something.

218
00:14:56,852 --> 00:14:59,169
Rym: Whoa, I had a read a rotary dial when I was a kid.

219
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:03,886
Scott: We're talking 90s, all right, you had a Phineas's key modem and you do dialed someone 80.

220
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:18,176
Rym: Yep right so The ringing sound you hear in the phone actually means like that is a part of the SLA of the phone network that the Destination phone is ringing.

221
00:15:18,557 --> 00:15:22,848
Scott: I thought the destination phone was actually making those noises and sending them over the phone line to you.

222
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:25,722
Rym: Uh I'm pretty sure that was.

223
00:15:25,762 --> 00:15:26,790
Scott: you call different places.

224
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,538
Scott: You heard different rings based on what phone they had.

225
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:30,447
Rym: pretty sure that wasn't actually true in the 90s.

226
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,201
Rym: but I'm not actually that familiar with the previous iterations of the phone like

227
00:15:34,221 --> 00:15:44,750
Scott: that like when the person picks up the phone they start talking and You hear and their voice gets sent over the line But before then the phone that has now received a call is and ringing out loud is also sending ringing noise.

228
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,895
Scott: What's crazy line to you.

229
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:49,069
Rym: is my freshman year wrong, but that's what I thought my freshman year.

230
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:54,390
Rym: at RIT I actually took a whole class on this stuff and I mostly forgot it all because it's literally irrelevant to the modern world.

231
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:56,892
Scott: Yeah, unless you're setting up an asterisk server Which you're not.

232
00:15:57,033 --> 00:16:01,972
Rym: but like the sound that a phone makes when you try to call someone in the phone is busy Like that.

233
00:16:02,012 --> 00:16:08,349
Rym: DDD like all those things are very well-defined and there's rules about them and more importantly there's laws about them.

234
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:15,550
Rym: Yep So this story is fascinating and I'm only gonna skim the details because partly there's a broader story.

235
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,799
Rym: I want to talk about the rough story here.

236
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,880
Rym: Is that t-mobile was caught Faking the ring?

237
00:16:21,961 --> 00:16:23,290
Rym: sounds that come back.

238
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,477
Scott: Why would you want to fake the ring sound?

239
00:16:25,598 --> 00:16:29,150
Rym: because the old phone network the hyper?

240
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,736
Rym: reliable phone network with all those mechanical relays and everything.

241
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:33,077
Rym: Mm-hmm.

242
00:16:33,197 --> 00:16:43,424
Rym: It's really expensive to run and Really really really expensive to run in Shit-ass rural burg like a middle-of-nowhere, Arizona, right?

243
00:16:43,464 --> 00:16:44,166
Scott: But it's still there.

244
00:16:44,206 --> 00:16:45,750
Scott: You could just you connect someone to it.

245
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,529
Scott: What's a big degree?

246
00:16:47,034 --> 00:16:52,230
Scott: But there's a lot of things going on For it, whoever's whoever's in that area pays.

247
00:16:52,250 --> 00:17:02,758
Rym: So part of the reason that worked is there was a limited number of phone companies and the infrastructure is relatively simple And they all sort of followed the same rules, but in the modern world of the Internet there's a lot of ways to connect calls.

248
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:20,690
Rym: most people are using cell phones exclusively and It might just be that a cell phone trying to make a call Going through all these different networks that are run by all these different private companies Might time out or otherwise not make it to some shit-ass rural phone somewhere that still has some old physical infrastructure.

249
00:17:21,531 --> 00:17:24,465
Scott: So rather than I don't know every time I've called the landline it works.

250
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:27,703
Rym: Uh I'm trying to think of the last time I call the landline.

251
00:17:27,723 --> 00:17:29,373
Rym: that wasn't like an 800.

252
00:17:29,373 --> 00:17:32,204
Scott: you live in a farm in the sticks and you have a telephone.

253
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,650
Scott: let us know we'll try to call you.

254
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:38,595
Scott: We will both try to call you first come first serve Like you need to be in the way.

255
00:17:38,635 --> 00:17:39,700
Scott: sticks way.

256
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,070
Scott: Yeah, and you have a landline most in the forum.

257
00:17:42,291 --> 00:18:02,014
Rym: we'll decide if you're sticks enough, yeah, but basically there's a bunch of things going on because a lot of the phone networks in rural areas are selling numbers in those areas to companies that then provide telephony services to other areas because it's way cheaper to connect or The air.

258
00:18:02,054 --> 00:18:05,770
Rym: the infrastructure those phone numbers run on is subsidized by old federal nonsense.

259
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:15,010
Rym: so that's why you can go to all these services and pay like 20 bucks a month and get as many 888 numbers as you want and just like route calls everywhere All right.

260
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:19,285
Rym: But what this means is this is a lot of the SLA of the phone network is starting to fail.

261
00:18:19,305 --> 00:18:21,935
Scott: still haven't explained why t-mobile Would fake the ringing noise.

262
00:18:22,136 --> 00:18:23,140
Scott: what is what is t-mobile?

263
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,930
Rym: give a shit because t-mobile tries to connect to some destination.

264
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:30,510
Scott: All right, so I have t-mobile phone and I'm in New York City with my t-mobile smartphone.

265
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:32,899
Scott: So I'm a t-mobile iPhone and I call.

266
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,470
Scott: the person who lives in the sticks is listening to this show.

267
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,061
Scott: So why does t-mobile give a shit just connect the call?

268
00:18:38,342 --> 00:18:40,230
Scott: So yeah, why would you fake the ringing noise?

269
00:18:40,311 --> 00:18:52,688
Rym: so they're trying to connect the call but the call the the circuit might not actually be open to that destination for a Significant amount of time because of all these complications in the I want to see mobile characters.

270
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:53,110
Scott: Let me wait.

271
00:18:53,672 --> 00:18:58,150
Scott: So you call you always I'm used to that where you call and like there's a silent noise and you go, huh?

272
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,865
Scott: Why isn't it ringing and eventually it rings.

273
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:00,369
Scott: that happens?

274
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:04,250
Rym: Yeah, so the it might have been too long or they didn't want to worry about it.

275
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:09,762
Rym: It was much easier to just always start playing a ringtone back at whoever called Well separately.

276
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:10,449
Rym: you're trying to connect.

277
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,826
Scott: Okay, why would you do that?

278
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:15,196
Rym: I'm not t-mobile.

279
00:19:15,256 --> 00:19:17,589
Scott: like the person let the person wait one.

280
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,039
Scott: I don't understand the benefit to t-mobile.

281
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:23,214
Rym: if I try to call anyone and I don't hear a ring like right away I just hang up.

282
00:19:23,254 --> 00:19:23,658
Rym: I just give up.

283
00:19:23,698 --> 00:19:25,230
Scott: and what is t-mobile should like that?

284
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,968
Scott: Yeah, why don't I send the benefit to t-mobile of?

285
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,670
Rym: Mobile, I don't know why they went down.

286
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:34,424
Scott: Well, that's key to understanding the story because that's the thing they did.

287
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,337
Scott: that was supposedly bad But I don't know why.

288
00:19:36,417 --> 00:19:37,748
Scott: what benefit they get from doing it?

289
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:38,612
Rym: partly?

290
00:19:38,672 --> 00:19:53,138
Rym: I think it was just to simplify their own infrastructure by not having to track all the way to the end destination if you made it there and when that phone actually started ringing before you come all the way back and play a specific SLA based ringtone on the other

291
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:56,813
Scott: feel like that's how just the phone system would work by default and you have to do extra Work to me.

292
00:19:56,853 --> 00:19:58,322
Scott: No, it's now again.

293
00:19:58,362 --> 00:19:59,810
Rym: It's that's not how it works anymore.

294
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:07,510
Rym: It's way more complicated than it used to be and frankly that SLA is probably fundamentally obsolete, but it's still regulated.

295
00:20:08,231 --> 00:20:09,839
Rym: It's still part of the FCC rules.

296
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,230
Rym: The rules about how phones work are very strict

297
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:13,694
Scott: Mm-hmm,

298
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:26,233
Rym: and the meta point I want to make is that I think the reason it took so long That for anyone even notice or do anything about this is that most people your cell phones don't give a fuck and rarely if ever Make phone calls.

299
00:20:26,654 --> 00:20:31,530
Rym: Yes, and when they do they're almost always calling someone else who's also on a cell phone.

300
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:38,530
Rym: So the reason why this issue made it as long as it did is partly that people like us don't call people.

301
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:45,071
Rym: And if we do call people I use modern technology like the internet and I don't try to call a landline Mm-hmm.

302
00:20:45,413 --> 00:20:46,216
Scott: I don't think the sticks.

303
00:20:46,617 --> 00:20:49,890
Rym: I don't think I've tried to call a landline in a decade.

304
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,395
Scott: I've called my mom's phone, which is a landline.

305
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:52,520
Scott: My mom doesn't have a landline.

306
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,443
Scott: My mom does.

307
00:20:53,804 --> 00:20:55,390
Rym: No relative of mine has a landline.

308
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,855
Scott: Even though it is a landline.

309
00:20:56,936 --> 00:21:00,010
Scott: I think it is provided by the cable company.

310
00:21:00,111 --> 00:21:10,650
Scott: So I think technically it's like a VoIP phone that just has the phone number Of the former landline that was in the house And I think it might even use the landline in the house like it connects to it.

311
00:21:10,891 --> 00:21:14,230
Scott: But I think that I could get a landline, but I think that basically it's like it's like an old.

312
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,810
Scott: It's like an old-school phone with an old-school landline wire.

313
00:21:17,292 --> 00:21:22,470
Scott: But then when you get outside to where the connection is actually it's can that you know that old?

314
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:24,662
Scott: It's cooking up to some sort of VoIP transceiver.

315
00:21:24,682 --> 00:21:28,483
Rym: Well, yeah, I mean I got an rj11 I could just use and it plugs into my files box.

316
00:21:28,524 --> 00:21:29,630
Scott: Yeah, it's something like that, right?

317
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,794
Scott: Yeah, I think that's what it is where it's.

318
00:21:30,895 --> 00:21:33,224
Scott: it's a landline, but it's not really so.

319
00:21:33,344 --> 00:21:38,030
Rym: this is a kind of complicated story And you can read the article if you're really interested in the details.

320
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:41,139
Rym: But basically t-mobile is getting fined a pittance for this.

321
00:21:41,862 --> 00:21:47,997
Rym: and this is the other meta story the FCC Because American politics is completely fucked right now.

322
00:21:48,017 --> 00:21:49,822
Scott: The FCC is just basically the worst.

323
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:58,070
Rym: Yeah, but they're even worse now Because they're controlled by the Republican Party, which is the bad party in the US.

324
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:08,017
Rym: So the Democrats actually wanted to take much more aggressive action to deal with the fundamental problem of Phone companies are ignoring most of America.

325
00:22:08,037 --> 00:22:10,103
Rym: Mm-hmm, at least bland wise.

326
00:22:10,364 --> 00:22:19,530
Rym: Yep, and kind of like the post office We need to provide basic connectivity services to everywhere people live regardless of how economically viable.

327
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:21,850
Scott: I mean FCC are not Democrat or Republican or not.

328
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:27,870
Scott: Show me a time where a company was actually fined and a major company was fined and punished.

329
00:22:28,211 --> 00:22:30,461
Scott: An actual significant amount like they should be.

330
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:32,370
Scott: I can only think of like a few handful.

331
00:22:32,511 --> 00:22:34,826
Scott: So these are completely breaking up AT&T.

332
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:39,270
Scott: Yeah, these Right There's not a lot of them, right?

333
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:47,900
Scott: There's not a lot of times when companies have actually been punished a proportionate amount, but in this case in particular The Democrats.

334
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:56,994
Rym: because basically the Minority on this because the Republicans are in power so they get the majority meaning they can literally do whatever they want Ignoring the Democrats.

335
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:02,710
Rym: so they basically did this like minimum fine and are just sort of ignoring the issue.

336
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:08,930
Scott: Yeah I don't even understand the point of having the two opposing people there just so they can say what they is as the Democrat.

337
00:23:09,031 --> 00:23:09,272
Scott: It's like.

338
00:23:09,352 --> 00:23:12,510
Scott: it's basically just so you can let everyone know that it's bullshit.

339
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,870
Scott: And I guess occasionally when you agree and you vote it's just symbolic, right?

340
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:16,352
Scott: It's sort of like.

341
00:23:16,372 --> 00:23:17,276
Scott: well, you can see.

342
00:23:17,316 --> 00:23:19,505
Scott: well, we disagree and all voted.

343
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:20,308
Scott: Yes, so clearly.

344
00:23:20,368 --> 00:23:20,810
Scott: this is good.

345
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:35,350
Rym: This is a pretty recent phenomenon and all these committees where previously There would more often than you would expect be some sort of compromise or they'd argue behind closed doors And then they just present like they'd vote unanimously or close.

346
00:23:35,611 --> 00:23:39,590
Scott: I'm pretty sure I remember when they were doing all this stuff during the Obama times.

347
00:23:39,671 --> 00:23:41,260
Scott: It was usually three to all the time.

348
00:23:41,341 --> 00:23:48,669
Rym: Also, it depends It's gotten to the point that it is the rule as opposed to the exception in the last year.

349
00:23:49,674 --> 00:24:02,168
Rym: But basically the Democrat made a good point that this affected billions of telephone calls to rural areas over the last several years and is a quote massively deceptive and harmful violation.

350
00:24:02,189 --> 00:24:10,690
Rym: and The FCC will net will not even look at changing these rules will not even look at updating like basic connectivity services.

351
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:18,350
Rym: I mean I would argue that broadband connectivity to these rural areas should be a right way more important than plain old telephone nonsense.

352
00:24:18,699 --> 00:24:19,130
Scott: I mean, yeah.

353
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:29,379
Scott: I mean also if I was in charge of the world anytime anyone got fined for anything the fine would always be Proportional to their means and significance.

354
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:40,173
Scott: So if like you're a poor person and you know the iron monkey strategy Yeah, if you're a poor person you do some crime like littering I'd be like one dollar fine and they'd be like no God damn it.

355
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:40,716
Scott: I can't.

356
00:24:40,756 --> 00:24:41,499
Scott: they'd be pissed off.

357
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:42,081
Scott: There's like a whole.

358
00:24:42,302 --> 00:24:43,165
Scott: it's a big deal, right.

359
00:24:43,486 --> 00:24:52,390
Scott: and if Bill Gates litters Fucking hundred million dollar fine go fuck yourself Bill Gates Same littering but it has to be an amount where he like he'll be like, ah shit, right?

360
00:24:53,193 --> 00:24:55,410
Scott: So 40 million dollars t-mobile doesn't even give a shit, right?

361
00:24:56,050 --> 00:25:01,490
Scott: If you find any company ever it has to be enough to make their stock go down and people sell off.

362
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,581
Scott: That's the only because that's the only way the CEO will be hurt.

363
00:25:04,641 --> 00:25:06,530
Scott: right is that the stock has to go down significantly.

364
00:25:06,731 --> 00:25:12,836
Scott: So what it's like what's t-mobile's like total worth like some billions 25% of your worth.

365
00:25:12,917 --> 00:25:13,821
Scott: here's one minimum.

366
00:25:13,901 --> 00:25:17,824
Rym: This is probably the first time where I'm gonna go beyond you So you're gonna find him even harder.

367
00:25:17,844 --> 00:25:25,246
Rym: So I generally Ideologically disagree with the death penalty for basic for criminal law.

368
00:25:25,547 --> 00:25:32,089
Rym: Yeah I Don't want to get into the details of that argument that discussion mean death penalty for a company?

369
00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:35,430
Scott: sure But I mean don't think you give t-mobile the death penalty if it is.

370
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:41,416
Rym: Oh, no, but I'm saying if there is a death penalty for humans Irrespective of whether or not.

371
00:25:41,476 --> 00:25:48,600
Rym: that is the right thing to have if it exists and Corporations are ostensibly treated like humans for many purposes.

372
00:25:48,961 --> 00:25:51,750
Rym: Then there should also be a death penalty for corporations.

373
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,633
Scott: Yeah, but this isn't.

374
00:25:52,694 --> 00:26:00,507
Scott: this isn't bad enough to warn the death penalty for t-mobile, but there are many corporations For example, I don't know any company that like poisons a river.

375
00:26:00,527 --> 00:26:05,190
Scott: It's like yeah Yeah I think not only should you give the death penalty but all the executives should go to real jail.

376
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,009
Rym: But the other sort of a more subtle point to think about is that whenever you're building new things?

377
00:26:10,112 --> 00:26:21,255
Rym: It is important that the people who are building the new thing at least someone building the new thing Understands what the old thing they're replacing did and why it did what I what it did I think I do.

378
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:21,938
Scott: they just don't give a shit.

379
00:26:22,321 --> 00:26:22,683
Rym: I don't know.

380
00:26:22,763 --> 00:26:23,990
Scott: It's got to also care.

381
00:26:24,212 --> 00:26:31,910
Rym: It is very easy to believe that Having the ringtone just play through a cell phone was just some engineer saying well that makes sense.

382
00:26:32,611 --> 00:26:39,412
Rym: I'm not thinking about this like physical relay connected to some copper in Oklahoma saying is like an open DNS Thing.

383
00:26:39,452 --> 00:26:42,470
Scott: or the people who may go up in DNS don't care how DNS is supposed to work.

384
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:45,685
Scott: Yeah, and they don't send you an NX for a non-existing domain.

385
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:46,790
Scott: They send you some other bullshit.

386
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:51,470
Rym: I wonder if the open DNS people are still mad at us for saying that they are naive.

387
00:26:51,752 --> 00:26:52,155
Scott: I don't know.

388
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:54,491
Scott: open DNS is like a big thing now, but I know We are.

389
00:26:54,511 --> 00:27:01,020
Rym: the ship of Well-formed DNS sailed and we lost that fight a long time ago.

390
00:27:01,221 --> 00:27:01,823
Scott: No, I'm actually.

391
00:27:01,863 --> 00:27:03,448
Scott: everyone else provides well-formed DNS.

392
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:10,264
Rym: Yeah Well, so the T the TLDs Expansion has started to pollute the core idea of a tree.

393
00:27:10,766 --> 00:27:19,550
Rym: But anyway, I digress but anyway things of the day.

394
00:27:19,911 --> 00:27:36,670
Rym: So the Nintendo switch is very important because this is the first mainstream console I have bought myself to play games on since the 3ds and Before that was the DS and before that was Scott and I shared that gamikube that Scott bought and before that it was the SNES.

395
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:41,246
Rym: Like I I was very disengaged from consoles for a long time.

396
00:27:41,287 --> 00:27:42,210
Rym: The switch is amazing.

397
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:56,064
Rym: However, this video is living proof that even a great console Pales in comparison to the same experience on a PC Can mod it and mess with it.

398
00:27:56,084 --> 00:28:03,650
Scott: Mm-hmm I mean pub G. the latest and greatest craze is a mod just like counter-strike was yep And you can't mod anything on switch, right?

399
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,897
Scott: Imagine if you could mod Zelda for reals.

400
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:07,462
Scott: What kind of all these like?

401
00:28:07,522 --> 00:28:09,950
Scott: imagine what games would emerge, right?

402
00:28:10,892 --> 00:28:18,196
Rym: That would be the next pub G which is not only a mod mashup of Breath of the Wild with I think the shot.

403
00:28:18,216 --> 00:28:18,417
Scott: I mean.

404
00:28:18,457 --> 00:28:23,049
Scott: look at the randomize just people make because they can mod, you know The SNES games you can't mod switch games.

405
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:29,069
Rym: But I think the genre of what is mashed up here is called weird shit Rym's into a man.

406
00:28:29,189 --> 00:28:36,710
Scott: one day They're gonna have you know Like in the way the decade or so we're gonna have mods of switch Zelda and they're gonna do a randomizer.

407
00:28:37,052 --> 00:28:39,186
Rym: Oh, yeah, so Breath of the Wild randomizer.

408
00:28:39,207 --> 00:28:40,753
Rym: Oh my god I look.

409
00:28:40,773 --> 00:28:46,973
Rym: I await the day where I can watch a Breath of the Wild where the very important item is just in some random Ass cave.

410
00:28:47,053 --> 00:28:48,398
Scott: It's like oh that Korok seed.

411
00:28:48,498 --> 00:28:49,582
Scott: Actually, that was the key item.

412
00:28:49,702 --> 00:28:50,324
Scott: That was Gannon.

413
00:28:50,545 --> 00:28:51,850
Rym: Yeah, Gannon is just hiding there.

414
00:28:52,271 --> 00:28:52,893
Scott: Oh Triforce.

415
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:53,414
Scott: Yep.

416
00:28:53,635 --> 00:29:01,249
Rym: Anyway, so yeah, but also it's worth noting that the song on this thing of the day Might be one of my favorite songs.

417
00:29:02,057 --> 00:29:14,666
Scott: Okay Well, let me talk to you about another song on the Wu Tang album return to the 36th chamber sung by the deceased old dirty bastard known as shimmy shimmy.

418
00:29:14,948 --> 00:29:30,131
Scott: ah Here is an excellent perhaps better than the original rendition of this song by one of my favorite people mum, rah the everliving I'm like old dirty bastard is Everliving.

419
00:29:30,512 --> 00:29:38,355
Scott: this is just too and also is also and like old dirty bastard is old dirty And a bastard.

420
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:44,802
Rym: I uh, I also legit like this Rendition of this song and it gives me a feel.

421
00:29:44,822 --> 00:29:46,750
Scott: I don't think you know the original rendition of this song.

422
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:47,472
Rym: I don't know Wu Tang.

423
00:29:47,492 --> 00:29:48,495
Rym: that well, okay.

424
00:29:48,635 --> 00:29:53,229
Scott: Can you name more than one Wu Tang member that I already named?

425
00:29:53,329 --> 00:30:03,777
Rym: Nope Okay, just so we put that in terms of Rym's music in that in that in that that area of music like things I enjoy I knew the Wu Tang clan existed.

426
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:09,918
Rym: All right, and when as someone has pointed out, that's a Wu Tang song I've usually thought oh, that's a pretty good song.

427
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,625
Scott: Yeah, there's a reason they famous.

428
00:30:11,645 --> 00:30:13,010
Rym: Yeah, it's about as far as they got.

429
00:30:13,454 --> 00:30:17,407
Rym: I do want to hear the The album that we don't know we can't hear yet.

430
00:30:18,434 --> 00:30:24,790
Scott: well Have you listened to the eco, why are you so you're so interested in listening to this unobtainable Wu Tang album?

431
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:27,224
Scott: Do you realize there are Wu Tang albums?

432
00:30:27,264 --> 00:30:28,270
Scott: You could already listen.

433
00:30:28,892 --> 00:30:34,629
Rym: If you look at my sonos history, I was listening to a bunch of Wu Tang clan a couple weeks ago.

434
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:37,223
Rym: I don't know names of songs off the top of my head.

435
00:30:37,706 --> 00:30:43,119
Scott: You don't know The classic in the meta moment.

436
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,987
Rym: the book club book is the Odyssey by Homer.

437
00:30:47,268 --> 00:30:51,050
Scott: I'm not working next week So I'll probably be going on an Odyssey.

438
00:30:51,431 --> 00:30:55,144
Scott: So I've gone on quite an Odyssey already and also it's shorter than I thought.

439
00:30:55,205 --> 00:30:56,690
Scott: I just stopped reading it.

440
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,044
Rym: So she got to Odysseus, right?

441
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,374
Rym: Are you still a Telemachus?

442
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:02,141
Scott: I just got to Odysseus.

443
00:31:02,241 --> 00:31:03,265
Scott: Okay, he's on the island.

444
00:31:03,285 --> 00:31:03,747
Scott: He's on the island.

445
00:31:04,751 --> 00:31:06,838
Scott: I think he's building a raft and making his move.

446
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:09,688
Rym: Okay, so Hermes came was like yo, you got to let this guy go.

447
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:14,430
Rym: stop Stop having amazing goddess sex with him every single night.

448
00:31:14,591 --> 00:31:16,985
Scott: I don't know why she doesn't have amazing goddess sex with like Hermes.

449
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:17,810
Scott: who's a god right there.

450
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:24,323
Rym: my one of my favorite And Hermes wouldn't say no in the Odyssey is when Hermes is like god.

451
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,707
Rym: damn it cuz Zeus is like Hermes.

452
00:31:25,948 --> 00:31:26,610
Rym: go deal with this.

453
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:26,931
Rym: He's like.

454
00:31:27,614 --> 00:31:35,660
Rym: and then he goes and even he is like, whoa this island Whoa, he literally goes from Olympus to this island.

455
00:31:36,182 --> 00:31:37,587
Scott: I mean Olympus isn't that great.

456
00:31:37,627 --> 00:31:38,430
Scott: That's the thing, right?

457
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,461
Scott: Olympus is not like fuck it in paradise.

458
00:31:40,521 --> 00:31:41,567
Scott: It's the top of a mountain.

459
00:31:41,587 --> 00:31:44,510
Rym: It's fucking cold Yeah, but it's still opulent full of splendor.

460
00:31:45,351 --> 00:31:48,081
Scott: It's better than man meat world or Hades, but it's not.

461
00:31:48,181 --> 00:31:49,868
Scott: it's not as good as fucking.

462
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:51,607
Scott: you know Whatever the name of that island is.

463
00:31:54,032 --> 00:31:54,715
Rym: But yeah, so we'll.

464
00:31:54,815 --> 00:31:55,819
Rym: uh, this is the book club.

465
00:31:55,859 --> 00:31:56,441
Rym: you should read it.

466
00:31:56,561 --> 00:31:57,204
Rym: it's amazing.

467
00:31:57,464 --> 00:32:09,302
Rym: Emily Wilson did a fantastic job Translating this in a way to where reading it feels like just reading a story and enjoying it for what it is Without having to parse through somewhat archaic language.

468
00:32:09,362 --> 00:32:09,703
Rym: Yeah.

469
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:19,470
Scott: No what they didn't write it, you know a lot of people Intentionally write in old-timey ways and she pointed out like, you know These people make an English translation and they write it with like ye old choppy talk.

470
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:22,570
Rym: Yeah, ye old choppy talk isn't any closer, right?

471
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:31,761
Scott: The whole Greek fake old English is only like a couple hundred, you know, even if that's how they spoke Yeah, which they didn't and that would only be like 200 years ago.

472
00:32:31,781 --> 00:32:35,380
Scott: Whereas Homer Odyssey is BC You're not.

473
00:32:35,724 --> 00:32:42,110
Scott: it's like you Predates the Greek it predates the idea of English it predates Greece.

474
00:32:42,591 --> 00:32:44,477
Rym: So this is some like there's.

475
00:32:44,577 --> 00:32:49,290
Scott: no there is no point in using old-fashioned sounding language, right?

476
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,847
Scott: It's not that much closer.

477
00:32:52,613 --> 00:32:55,170
Rym: Yeah, at least Shakespeare is a product of its time.

478
00:32:55,491 --> 00:32:58,662
Scott: Yeah, Shakespeare that's is how Shakespeare, you know wrote plays.

479
00:32:58,702 --> 00:33:00,890
Scott: that might not be how they talked but that's how they wrote plays.

480
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:04,138
Scott: There's the actual words that Shakespeare wrote.

481
00:33:04,198 --> 00:33:06,326
Scott: Shakespeare was a person most likely we know.

482
00:33:06,346 --> 00:33:08,490
Rym: so if you're listening We know more about Shakespeare.

483
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:20,267
Rym: They know about Homer because you saw us at PAX East because somehow our morning panel And you're confused that we haven't even mentioned games yet filled the room which it did eventually fill the room.

484
00:33:20,387 --> 00:33:21,170
Rym: They turned people away.

485
00:33:22,272 --> 00:33:23,136
Scott: They feel that's awesome.

486
00:33:23,177 --> 00:33:23,659
Scott: empty seats.

487
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,227
Scott: Yes, I believe in.

488
00:33:25,247 --> 00:33:27,058
Rym: they were smart Yeah, but they're also a ton of people.

489
00:33:27,078 --> 00:33:29,010
Scott: stay like if you listen to the stream not smart.

490
00:33:29,071 --> 00:33:30,150
Scott: They should learn from the people who left.

491
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:37,250
Rym: But if you wanted that list of games you saw us and now you don't wonder why we're talking about Linux and all this nonsense.

492
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:42,875
Rym: Well, guess what GeekNights is four nights Mondays our technology and Linux and stuff You probably don't care about.

493
00:33:43,136 --> 00:33:45,788
Rym: Tuesdays is where you're want to listen and not not tomorrow.

494
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:46,110
Scott: Tuesday.

495
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:49,930
Scott: You're gonna have to wait a whole week and maybe even not even then because I'm not working.

496
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,690
Scott: Who knows if I'll be in the mood to make a podcast?

497
00:33:51,951 --> 00:34:03,826
Rym: Yeah, we're on a minor hiatus But while GeekNights is coming in and out while we're sort of getting our shit together because Scott and I have both made Significant life changes recently and there's a lot we got to deal with.

498
00:34:04,429 --> 00:34:12,070
Rym: but We are doubling down on the YouTube content because once we do pre-production Scott and I can go our separate ways and crank it out.

499
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,536
Scott: Yeah, thanks to my new computer.

500
00:34:13,596 --> 00:34:17,150
Scott: I was able to make a video with much greater ease than usual.

501
00:34:17,531 --> 00:34:23,188
Scott: So we have and my video skills increase slightly each time I make a video, you know, what really helped you out?

502
00:34:24,552 --> 00:34:25,235
Scott: I don't need the knob.

503
00:34:25,255 --> 00:34:28,250
Scott: The knob is not necessarily really underestimate the power of this knob.

504
00:34:28,411 --> 00:34:31,630
Scott: I did not at any point feel that I had the need for a knob.

505
00:34:31,891 --> 00:34:35,349
Rym: You never wanted to just move something one frame before you did your thing to it.

506
00:34:36,331 --> 00:34:40,266
Rym: No, I don't even use my keyboard just a mouse and knob and I can do almost everything.

507
00:34:40,588 --> 00:34:41,070
Rym: It's amazing.

508
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,735
Scott: I used I learned the keyboard shortcuts.

509
00:34:43,297 --> 00:34:44,643
Rym: Yeah, my keyboard shortcut.

510
00:34:44,703 --> 00:34:49,605
Rym: This does more than I got a shuttle and I got a. well anyway, I have a mouse wheel.

511
00:34:49,626 --> 00:34:50,089
Scott: I'm a mouse.

512
00:34:50,491 --> 00:34:55,969
Scott: Yeah mouse left and right arrows and not enough if I hold shift and push the left and right as it goes even faster.

513
00:34:56,513 --> 00:35:04,225
Scott: Then I have markers so I can just push up and down and go Turn this shuttle and the speed just varies.

514
00:35:04,285 --> 00:35:05,330
Rym: in an analog fashion.

515
00:35:05,431 --> 00:35:07,766
Scott: I can just push the up and down or to go to exact spot.

516
00:35:07,786 --> 00:35:08,148
Scott: I need to go.

517
00:35:09,112 --> 00:35:10,537
Rym: Uh, your timeline is much simpler.

518
00:35:10,658 --> 00:35:11,801
Rym: You want me to send you what.

519
00:35:12,022 --> 00:35:12,885
Rym: what a GeekNights presents.

520
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:18,546
Rym: your tenant project looks like The like nested sequence upon nested sequence and templates everywhere.

521
00:35:18,566 --> 00:35:19,470
Scott: I think I'm good.

522
00:35:20,343 --> 00:35:27,470
Rym: but anyway So our video judging and reviewing all of the anime that's coming out in the spring.

523
00:35:28,113 --> 00:35:30,025
Scott: So we have not yet watched the spring season.

524
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:30,770
Scott: that has already begun.

525
00:35:31,051 --> 00:35:33,058
Rym: We already reviewed it all and the video is on YouTube.

526
00:35:33,078 --> 00:35:33,921
Scott: We previewed it.

527
00:35:34,121 --> 00:35:35,165
Rym: Oh, we reviewed it.

528
00:35:35,326 --> 00:35:35,566
Rym: Sure.

529
00:35:35,587 --> 00:35:38,674
Rym: We're rarely wrong Even though we don't.

530
00:35:38,955 --> 00:35:42,109
Rym: it seems like we don't know how all that persona nonsense is linked together.

531
00:35:42,129 --> 00:35:46,061
Rym: now I do but I don't think the persona fans even really understand.

532
00:35:46,121 --> 00:35:50,317
Scott: No, they explained it to me that it's like if they're correct I'm trusting them.

533
00:35:50,457 --> 00:35:53,130
Scott: Yeah that it's sort of like Final Fantasy where it's not linked together.

534
00:35:53,231 --> 00:35:56,750
Scott: They just all have the sort of like some similar themes like all the Final Fantasy of chocobos.

535
00:35:57,351 --> 00:36:03,070
Scott: Final Fantasy 10 is nothing to do with Final Fantasy 6 other than they both have chocobos or Boogles or whatever, right?

536
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:09,090
Scott: So personas like that, which is actually good news because I was basically avoiding persona completely because I thought it was all connected.

537
00:36:09,191 --> 00:36:11,390
Scott: But now I realize I could just go to any fucking persona thing.

538
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:14,570
Scott: I don't have to give a shit and maybe that actually makes me more likely to check one out.

539
00:36:14,751 --> 00:36:19,854
Rym: I watched a let's play like partially of persona for like just a little bit of it Like.

540
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:20,859
Rym: I feel like we could enjoy that.

541
00:36:20,939 --> 00:36:23,690
Scott: I mean, I think it's basically just an RPG that looks like an anime, right?

542
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:28,266
Rym: Yeah, yeah Yeah, so I feel like we should play Yakuza games before we play this.

543
00:36:28,648 --> 00:36:29,190
Scott: share whatever.

544
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:38,156
Rym: But the other video that's on YouTube is that panel the 40 tabletop games you need to play from PAX East 2018 in Glorious 2k.

545
00:36:38,176 --> 00:36:41,350
Rym: Well, you don't need 4k when it's just us day.

546
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,596
Scott: I only did 1080p is cuz.

547
00:36:42,616 --> 00:36:43,360
Scott: I'm like I'm gonna shit.

548
00:36:43,842 --> 00:36:45,108
Scott: I didn't know why my face in 4k.

549
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,536
Rym: You know why I do 2k.

550
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:47,260
Scott: I recorded it in.

551
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:49,211
Scott: 4k is but I put it out into 10.

552
00:36:49,211 --> 00:36:50,334
Rym: I do 2k cuz.

553
00:36:50,354 --> 00:36:51,638
Rym: I did some zooms plus.

554
00:36:51,658 --> 00:36:55,190
Scott: none of the other content other than the image of our face was 4k resolution.

555
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:57,615
Scott: So it would be kind of silly but

556
00:36:57,696 --> 00:37:09,890
Rym: I did it because When I'm doing the picture in picture like when we're talking the slides down here and when the slides up we're down here It means if someone does have a nice monitor that little area will be like 1080p or at least 720p depending on how big.

557
00:37:09,911 --> 00:37:12,859
Scott: Oh, yeah Because your cut that content was 1080p to be exactly.

558
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:14,746
Scott: none of the images of anime that I had were 1080p.

559
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:20,045
Rym: Yep So it is on YouTube and you can watch it and maybe you learn a lesson about.

560
00:37:20,085 --> 00:37:25,347
Rym: if you don't go to a GeekNights Panel at a con it's probably just gonna be on YouTube later.

561
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:26,110
Scott: That's right.

562
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,476
Scott: You shouldn't show up and you shouldn't.

563
00:37:27,577 --> 00:37:29,104
Scott: you should basically consume none of our.

564
00:37:29,144 --> 00:37:33,870
Rym: you should tell people Who don't know about our shit to go to the panel?

565
00:37:33,991 --> 00:37:44,039
Rym: so one we don't waste our time talking to people already know who we are and That way you can get them to go there and then they'll see the same panel and you don't have to tell them all the games Or whatever it is.

566
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:44,990
Rym: We talked about in the panel.

567
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,769
Scott: You just tell them to watch the YouTube video.

568
00:37:47,111 --> 00:37:54,442
Scott: I fast-forward so they can you waste as few time in their life as possible but then they can go play games with that extra time to catch 22.

569
00:37:54,442 --> 00:38:05,789
Rym: because if everyone learns that lesson and No one goes to our panels Then we'll have to do order into these anime panels because we don't go to anime cows anymore and record them in our houses Which is way less fun and doesn't get us free badges to conventions.

570
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,150
Scott: I'll just move forth.

571
00:38:07,834 --> 00:38:14,010
Rym: We're gonna get to I. we're gonna do a point in the future to where No one goes to panels at any convention because they're all on YouTube.

572
00:38:14,431 --> 00:38:19,770
Rym: Good except anime cons because you can't put any of that stuff on YouTube because the content idea immediately takes it down.

573
00:38:20,952 --> 00:38:22,621
Rym: Yeah, so destroying data.

574
00:38:22,782 --> 00:38:24,270
Rym: We talked a lot about backing stuff up.

575
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:26,330
Rym: I don't think we've talked recently about destroying things.

576
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:33,590
Scott: Well part of it is that in most cases not all cases, but most cases I find it morally reprehensible to destroy data.

577
00:38:33,851 --> 00:38:43,119
Rym: I keep I have chat logs of every I am conversation I have ever had Since the ICQ days, right?

578
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:51,970
Rym: I mean if you think every single conversation I've ever had I have the exact conversation when Scott and I talked online for the first time, right?

579
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:57,450
Scott: So now a lot of people might think like short-term about destroying data, right something like Rym's chat logs, right?

580
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:00,945
Scott: And first of all, just cuz you don't destroy the data doesn't mean you have to distribute the data.

581
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:03,598
Rym: Yeah That's a separate conversation, right?

582
00:39:03,638 --> 00:39:05,146
Rym: But yeah, it's not on the internet.

583
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:05,990
Rym: I don't even on the cloud.

584
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:08,861
Scott: I always think about you know, like Library of Alexandria.

585
00:39:08,961 --> 00:39:11,190
Scott: It's like ah, what a shame it was, right?

586
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:16,670
Scott: So when you delete a file, you know some you started to write something and then it's no good and you delete the file.

587
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:20,034
Scott: It's like okay That was probably worthless.

588
00:39:20,295 --> 00:39:21,620
Scott: You don't want anyone to see it.

589
00:39:21,961 --> 00:39:37,390
Rym: But one day you'll be dead and just Just Finding my NAS and finding on that NAS the thousands of garbage pictures I took of like New York City and using that as part of their Research into what New York City was like a thousand years ago.

590
00:39:37,571 --> 00:39:42,630
Scott: Even the most worthless data that you have created could be worth something, you know.

591
00:39:42,811 --> 00:39:49,822
Scott: Even something that seems completely like just a text file Could be a work of art or historical artifact or who knows what.

592
00:39:50,183 --> 00:39:57,345
Scott: so I'm usually don't want to delete any data But there are some things it is okay to delete for example child porn.

593
00:39:57,706 --> 00:39:58,749
Scott: delete it all please.

594
00:39:59,494 --> 00:40:00,379
Scott: Faster the better.

595
00:40:01,064 --> 00:40:04,273
Rym: one could make an argument That not deleting.

596
00:40:04,354 --> 00:40:11,070
Rym: it allows AI's expert systems and law enforcement personnel to use the data from it to find.

597
00:40:11,352 --> 00:40:14,636
Scott: Let us not get off topic Let us not get off top.

598
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:18,810
Rym: just saying there's a project out there where they ask people to take pictures of hotel rooms.

599
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:29,948
Rym: So Researchers who have the child porn that like the FBI has gotten when they've arrested people They can try to find the kids and rescue them.

600
00:40:31,176 --> 00:40:38,325
Rym: point is just saying Data may have a vet intrinsic value.

601
00:40:39,028 --> 00:40:39,450
Scott: anyway.

602
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:42,015
Scott: Deleting data is usually bad.

603
00:40:42,075 --> 00:40:44,242
Scott: But sometimes well, there's.

604
00:40:44,262 --> 00:40:46,108
Scott: you do have to delete some data.

605
00:40:46,128 --> 00:40:47,957
Rym: for examples There's two different.

606
00:40:47,977 --> 00:40:49,667
Rym: there's three different levels of deleting data.

607
00:40:49,728 --> 00:40:55,049
Rym: on one There's do you have data that is local that you were trying to destroy so no one ever gets it?

608
00:40:55,491 --> 00:40:59,410
Rym: Versus do you have data that you don't care about preserving necessarily?

609
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:03,281
Rym: Versus did you publish data and you're trying to unpublish it?

610
00:41:03,422 --> 00:41:04,525
Scott: Well, that's that's not deleting.

611
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,568
Scott: That's unpublishing true true But anyway, okay.

612
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:11,190
Scott: So the most basic case of deleting data is my phone is running out of room, right?

613
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:19,702
Scott: So obviously just go to listen to some old episode of one of a hundred episodes of eat nights about backing up Back it up somewhere else and delete it from your phone.

614
00:41:20,003 --> 00:41:21,650
Scott: Now same thing applies on your computer.

615
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:25,470
Scott: It's like oh, no, my computer's hard drive is full But I need to save this information.

616
00:41:25,852 --> 00:41:32,612
Scott: Put it some buy another hard drive save it somewhere else and then delete it from the place That's full like I keep by pushing the delete key Like I keep.

617
00:41:32,733 --> 00:41:36,046
Rym: every photo I take on my phone goes into Lightroom basically forever.

618
00:41:36,107 --> 00:41:36,930
Rym: They're tiny files.

619
00:41:37,272 --> 00:41:39,084
Rym: They own a Google photo forever.

620
00:41:39,104 --> 00:41:40,050
Rym: because they're tiny files.

621
00:41:40,393 --> 00:41:42,130
Scott: I got it backed up in three clouds.

622
00:41:42,331 --> 00:41:45,807
Scott: Remember cloud means other person's computer and also my NAS and also my computer.

623
00:41:45,867 --> 00:41:46,410
Scott: and what help?

624
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,598
Rym: Cuz I might want that data someday.

625
00:41:48,859 --> 00:41:53,989
Rym: the incremental cost to me of keeping that data Approaches zero on a pearl.

626
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:55,756
Scott: I like to add them all up together.

627
00:41:55,836 --> 00:41:59,570
Scott: actually it adds up to pennies a month which adds up to dollars which becomes significant.

628
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:05,650
Rym: Yeah, but the way I preserve that stuff is using mostly free surface anyway anyway.

629
00:42:06,631 --> 00:42:07,234
Scott: So there's that.

630
00:42:07,314 --> 00:42:08,819
Scott: that's normal deleting right?

631
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,181
Scott: You need to.

632
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:12,960
Scott: you're not actually deleting the data from existence You're just different one.

633
00:42:12,981 --> 00:42:14,090
Scott: you're doing it from one place.

634
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:17,907
Scott: Okay, so now I've got something I need to actually delete from existence.

635
00:42:18,007 --> 00:42:18,329
Scott: why?

636
00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:22,390
Scott: well I'm selling someone this hard drive, and I've backed everything up.

637
00:42:22,731 --> 00:42:28,710
Scott: I'm not deleting it from existence, but I need to make sure that whoever gets this hard drive can't recover any of that data.

638
00:42:28,971 --> 00:42:31,288
Rym: Yep, and that's mostly what we're talking about right now, right?

639
00:42:31,671 --> 00:42:35,024
Scott: And in that case you need a tool that has existed for a long time.

640
00:42:35,084 --> 00:42:41,425
Scott: that is still probably the best tool Called D band so named after the guy who made it Derek Derek's boot and nuke.

641
00:42:41,545 --> 00:42:42,970
Scott: now it boots and it nukes.

642
00:42:43,514 --> 00:42:48,499
Rym: When I was young I knew this was called D band But I always assumed that stood for something fun.

643
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:52,370
Scott: when you boot it it says right on the screen Derek's boot and nuke.

644
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,898
Scott: Yep, it's not hiding its name somehow.

645
00:42:54,998 --> 00:42:56,442
Rym: so well the first time.

646
00:42:56,482 --> 00:42:58,930
Rym: I actually had to use it was way back.

647
00:42:59,010 --> 00:42:59,775
Rym: I worked at IBM.

648
00:42:59,815 --> 00:43:01,586
Scott: I didn't know about its RIT, and that's when I used it.

649
00:43:01,626 --> 00:43:02,652
Rym: yeah at RIT I was.

650
00:43:02,692 --> 00:43:06,066
Rym: I was a co-op, and I was working in this department before I got her.

651
00:43:06,106 --> 00:43:18,116
Rym: like a big job there and the thing one of the things I had to do is We had all these servers, and they were like yo Wipe out all these hard drives following these regulations.

652
00:43:18,156 --> 00:43:24,277
Rym: they pointed me at this like government site of like regulations for destroying data and That's your project.

653
00:43:24,297 --> 00:43:26,189
Rym: spend a few months and like get rid of all this data.

654
00:43:26,993 --> 00:43:29,685
Rym: And I was like can I just take the hard drive down to drill pass press?

655
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:51,746
Rym: and they were like no We're going to reuse the hard drive somewhere mm-hmm, so I did my research and I encountered Derek's boot and nuke and I encountered that it actually did all the things that the regulations said I had to do about Overriding the data with random data a certain number of times to make sure there is no Feasible chance anyone could get that data back

656
00:43:52,067 --> 00:43:52,208
Scott: mm-hmm.

657
00:43:53,132 --> 00:43:53,714
Rym: And I did it.

658
00:43:53,955 --> 00:43:58,430
Scott: a lot of this has to do with the way magnetic hard drives work where even if you like delete files.

659
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:09,066
Scott: Well all that does is usually if you have to say if you know a normal file system is Delete the pointer to the file in the file system But it's somewhere to actually you know manually control the hard drive and read all the bits.

660
00:44:09,106 --> 00:44:10,611
Scott: all the bits of the file are still There.

661
00:44:10,631 --> 00:44:11,253
Scott: it's just.

662
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:14,565
Scott: they're not listed in the file system anymore, so they don't show up right.

663
00:44:14,906 --> 00:44:24,201
Scott: so you know It's like even modern file system, but you know also if you do try to delete them or overwrite them a magnetic hard drive It's like well You know it's like this sort of zero.

664
00:44:24,221 --> 00:44:25,450
Scott: you could sort of try to figure out.

665
00:44:26,392 --> 00:44:28,587
Scott: Aha this sector is a zero, but it used to be.

666
00:44:28,748 --> 00:44:30,336
Rym: oh Think of it this way.

667
00:44:30,416 --> 00:44:32,385
Rym: y'all the the analogy I was about to use.

668
00:44:32,787 --> 00:44:33,330
Scott: how does a work?

669
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:41,644
Rym: I was gonna talk about CRT's, but those are also obsolete yeah, so It's a similar thing though, and that say you have a you know what it's like.

670
00:44:41,684 --> 00:44:56,969
Rym: It's like the aspirin in a couch Sit in the couch for a long time data is just there, and then I get up There's a there's a really minuscule aspirin there so someone with a very high resolution camera could theoretically take a picture of that and

671
00:44:57,952 --> 00:44:58,915
Scott: Figure out who's that.

672
00:44:58,976 --> 00:45:00,761
Scott: figure out they could recreate the ass.

673
00:45:00,902 --> 00:45:02,767
Rym: yep, so think of it like that now.

674
00:45:02,848 --> 00:45:04,774
Scott: in practice This is.

675
00:45:05,115 --> 00:45:08,025
Scott: I've never actually seen a case actually of anyone actually doing that.

676
00:45:08,085 --> 00:45:18,270
Rym: I read a recent paper Showing that it is actually way less feasible Than it used to be because of the density of data on modern magnetic drives.

677
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:24,948
Rym: Yeah, cuz like back when this was a more feasible attack hard drive had like 500 megabytes on it mm-hmm.

678
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,736
Rym: nowadays I mean I have.

679
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:29,610
Rym: I have five eight terabyte hard drive sitting up there.

680
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:45,329
Rym: So also file systems have changed a lot like things have changed so much since the last time I cared about this Mm-hmm that I actually have to do a little bit of research if I actually want to wipe out data on.

681
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,418
Scott: a large D-band still works.

682
00:45:47,499 --> 00:45:48,142
Scott: It's still out there.

683
00:45:48,283 --> 00:45:49,690
Scott: Yeah, it's still gonna get the job done.

684
00:45:50,153 --> 00:45:52,089
Rym: I have not used it cuz I haven't actually given anyone.

685
00:45:52,431 --> 00:46:01,270
Scott: Actually heard recently though that D band was like bought by a different company And then yeah There's a fork and then the fork is what you should be using cuz you don't want to pay this company that bought D band.

686
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:02,005
Scott: I don't know.

687
00:46:02,712 --> 00:46:04,963
Rym: So I guess they give it this way when you on the high level.

688
00:46:04,983 --> 00:46:15,810
Rym: and the reason I don't go deep again It's just that the details are so specific To circumstance nowadays, and I don't even know what the story is with different kinds of SS.

689
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:18,920
Scott: The point is this is only good for deleting a whole hard drive.

690
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,826
Scott: usually you booting and nuking right.

691
00:46:20,906 --> 00:46:27,790
Scott: what if say I'm on my computer And I've got you know some files and I committed some crimes?

692
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:31,281
Scott: But they're good crimes cuz I'm a revolutionary person.

693
00:46:31,301 --> 00:46:32,765
Rym: Yeah, you're Robin Hood, right?

694
00:46:32,825 --> 00:46:35,829
Scott: I'm a good person allow it I'm doing some anti-government work.

695
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:43,123
Scott: That's actually but my government's evil and they're gonna come and take my computer And I can't have these files on the computer that they're about to that.

696
00:46:43,143 --> 00:46:45,612
Scott: I know they're coming to take so already You're fucked.

697
00:46:45,713 --> 00:46:49,270
Rym: and my argument is modern computers modern file systems.

698
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:57,310
Rym: there's a lot of collateral change and Circumstantial evidence that appears when you do anything on a computer.

699
00:46:57,832 --> 00:47:02,150
Rym: There's time stamps and there's stuff the file system did all over the place.

700
00:47:02,592 --> 00:47:10,324
Rym: It's pretty likely that no matter what you do to delete something that was previously there Someone could at least figure out that you deleted something.

701
00:47:10,585 --> 00:47:15,441
Rym: Oh, no shit I think that you've although you've already like.

702
00:47:15,501 --> 00:47:24,730
Rym: it's already too late if you're doing that kind of thing All the data that is ever involved in that thing should already be in a separate encrypted store somewhere.

703
00:47:24,911 --> 00:47:27,247
Scott: All right, so I've got a separate encrypted USB stick.

704
00:47:27,408 --> 00:47:31,990
Rym: Yep Okay, deleting the keys to out into decrypt it is the same as deleting the data.

705
00:47:33,831 --> 00:47:38,744
Rym: Yeah, because look at how Modern bit locker style malware works.

706
00:47:38,965 --> 00:47:46,510
Rym: It doesn't delete your files It encrypts them and if it doesn't if it doesn't give you the key to decrypt it the data is gone.

707
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:47,775
Rym: There's no way to get it back.

708
00:47:48,177 --> 00:47:48,278
Rym: It's.

709
00:47:48,579 --> 00:47:49,684
Rym: it might as well be deleted.

710
00:47:50,085 --> 00:47:51,009
Rym: It's arguably better.

711
00:47:51,291 --> 00:47:53,279
Scott: I mean, it's like this you go to someone's house.

712
00:47:53,762 --> 00:47:56,588
Scott: You put it you replace the lock on their front door You can't get in the house.

713
00:47:56,775 --> 00:47:57,793
Scott: Yeah But you can.

714
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:58,154
Scott: you're out.

715
00:47:58,174 --> 00:48:03,875
Scott: you can change the lock on their front door or you can actually install another door in front of their Front door that has a lock on it.

716
00:48:03,956 --> 00:48:07,670
Scott: Yeah, and that lock is 100% unlockable without the key magic lock.

717
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:09,215
Scott: It's a perfect magic lock.

718
00:48:09,697 --> 00:48:18,169
Scott: and now you eat the key and you threaten to not poop it out Unless or dissolve it an acid or something unless they give you money.

719
00:48:18,953 --> 00:48:23,964
Scott: So in the modern era like company and now no one can ever get in that house the end You have to smash the house.

720
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:29,610
Rym: Most companies have some sort of data retention policy and like rules for how they'll delete stuff.

721
00:48:30,337 --> 00:48:37,555
Rym: It seems like a lot of people either don't pay that much attention to what they've documented or They don't worry about it that much.

722
00:48:37,575 --> 00:48:38,498
Rym: Mm-hmm.

723
00:48:38,578 --> 00:49:02,189
Rym: And I don't know how much of a concern it really is Because from what I've read the feasibility if you just delete files and Override a hard disk with zeros like do like a DD and just like write zeros over everything on a hard disk I don't know if it's actually feasible for anyone other than a government operator That's well-funded to even attempt to get that data back.

724
00:49:02,471 --> 00:49:07,004
Scott: Yeah, and I don't know like an SSD like what really especially if that drive keeps getting used.

725
00:49:07,265 --> 00:49:14,630
Scott: because thinking if you're doing you know Data retention operations that like a corporation what you're doing is getting rid of old customer data probably, right?

726
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:26,989
Scott: Yeah, you're only keeping it for a certain amount of time and then you're clearing it out, you know, it's like, okay We'll keep your track of your I don't know your all your transactions and all the things you bought Only for a year and then we'll get rid of them right something like that.

727
00:49:27,271 --> 00:49:35,730
Scott: so that if anyone busts into our database and there's a leak which you know We're of course not gonna have a leak because we're not stupid like all that the other people had leaks like eco facts or whatever.

728
00:49:36,812 --> 00:49:45,550
Scott: If there is one, you know, or if they say there's an internal accurate the company who's evil and starts poking around the database They'll only get the last year of data and not your full world history.

729
00:49:47,071 --> 00:49:50,261
Scott: But you know what if you just clear delete those days.

730
00:49:50,361 --> 00:49:58,684
Scott: if you just do like delete everything older than a year Those are the same hard drives in the same server All the new information is gonna just start filling in that space over time.

731
00:49:59,266 --> 00:50:00,633
Scott: You're gonna be okay You can just.

732
00:50:00,653 --> 00:50:06,470
Rym: probably I think what it comes down to is as much as this Feels like it should be a very technology focused episode.

733
00:50:06,831 --> 00:50:18,730
Rym: The reality is that unless you work at a company with a policy and some real reason to care It generally doesn't matter because as a consumer just run something like DBAN and then just give sell the hard drive.

734
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:25,998
Scott: Yeah, I mean at that company with a data retention policy, you know a hard drive in the net the sand crashes or something Right or whatever.

735
00:50:26,018 --> 00:50:27,350
Scott: they use their storage array.

736
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:33,856
Scott: Yeah You take it out you put a new one in and then you make sure that before you put the old one in the garbage You do the DBAN equivalent.

737
00:50:33,936 --> 00:50:41,520
Rym: So most of the companies I have talked to about this over the years Prefer physical destruction of those situations.

738
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,126
Scott: perfectly fine as well.

739
00:50:43,186 --> 00:50:48,570
Rym: drill press to the platters Which theoretically if it's just a drill press through the platters someone could pull the platters out.

740
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:59,450
Scott: Well, if it's a magnetic with but if you take an SSD and put a drill through it Yeah, unless you miss the persistent storage in there I think you open it up and you find the right spot and just like shoot it with a gun.

741
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:05,463
Scott: Yeah Take you could actually just rip that one chip off and throw there, you know, but I guess the the.

742
00:51:05,724 --> 00:51:09,780
Rym: it's not a technology question It's a procedures question.

743
00:51:10,061 --> 00:51:19,036
Rym: if you need to delete data you need to do the research and come up with the risk-reward like ratios and procedures you could follow.

744
00:51:19,056 --> 00:51:21,506
Rym: and the most important thing about deleting

745
00:51:21,526 --> 00:51:21,868
Scott: data is

746
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:36,259
Rym: having an audit history of when and how you did you deleted the data so that if Someone recovers the data in some crazy way in the future You least have proof that you did what you said you did and that you Asserted that it was good enough at the time.

747
00:51:36,621 --> 00:51:38,430
Scott: It's a lot like, you know paper shredding, right?

748
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:45,460
Scott: It's like yeah, you just buy a paper shredder it, you know, all of us deep over whatever your staples Yeah, or Amazon and put a piece of paper in there.

749
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,231
Scott: a lot of crazy nuts are like, oh my god It.

750
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:54,330
Scott: those cut the paper in a certain pattern and and the government's know how to put together get a cross shredder.

751
00:51:54,430 --> 00:52:01,409
Rym: Yeah, if it if the piece of paper is like the names of your spies in North Korea Yeah, maybe you should use a cross shredder and then burn it.

752
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:10,978
Rym: but if it's my bank account statement the regular shredder I got from Amazon for the regular shredders and the raw chicken that it's in the Garbage with is probably sufficient.

753
00:52:11,279 --> 00:52:12,665
Scott: My shredder has its own trash bin.

754
00:52:12,786 --> 00:52:14,613
Scott: It's like its own Thing.

755
00:52:14,653 --> 00:52:15,436
Scott: it doesn't mix with the.

756
00:52:15,957 --> 00:52:18,044
Rym: oh, yeah, but I would just dump it in with the kitchen stuff.

757
00:52:18,606 --> 00:52:19,709
Rym: Okay, why not?

758
00:52:20,111 --> 00:52:20,554
Scott: Stick it up.

759
00:52:20,976 --> 00:52:23,350
Scott: Yeah help take it up help ward people away.

760
00:52:24,331 --> 00:52:26,920
Rym: I don't think anyone's digging through like cat litter.

761
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,968
Rym: No figure out a bank statement for me.

762
00:52:28,988 --> 00:52:32,982
Scott: No So, yeah, but yeah, I like big companies.

763
00:52:33,002 --> 00:52:35,792
Scott: what they do is they usually get the Visiting shredder.

764
00:52:35,812 --> 00:52:42,736
Scott: Yeah big day put all their shredding stuff in these bins with locks on them like padlocks that could easily be busted because it's a plastic bin.

765
00:52:43,118 --> 00:53:01,527
Scott: and then once a week or so the plastic bins go downstairs and there's Tractor trailer with an enormous shredder of industrial nature in it and it dumps out the bins into the shredder There's in such a way that even the shredding guys who are driving the truck can't even see what's in there and it shreds that Shit like oh, baby big time.

766
00:53:01,548 --> 00:53:10,396
Rym: now I get the impression that a lot of the stories of someone got a hard drive and got data off of it are Literally just thought nothing was even done.

767
00:53:10,436 --> 00:53:18,678
Rym: like the hard drive just stopped working and someone threw it away and didn't even try to Even get a shredder to put the hard drives in.

768
00:53:18,738 --> 00:53:20,667
Scott: I'm sure a big real big one.

769
00:53:20,687 --> 00:53:25,490
Rym: I have That kind of shredder before they are terrifying to be around.

770
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:30,142
Scott: Don't put any human flesh or any flesh period and anywhere near the entrance hole.

771
00:53:30,163 --> 00:53:36,652
Scott: Yeah use a long stick to drop the hard drive Grabbers.

772
00:53:36,853 --> 00:53:51,981
Rym: what this comes down to is if you just do basic due diligence to delete data from hard drives before you give them to people and If you can't do basic due diligence Destroy the hard drive rather than give it to anyone.

773
00:53:52,001 --> 00:53:54,290
Rym: Mm-hmm, and that's probably enough.

774
00:53:55,056 --> 00:54:02,669
Rym: And if you can't even do that Then all the data on your hard drive is probably still there and easy for anyone who gets that hard drive to get.

775
00:54:02,809 --> 00:54:07,970
Scott: if they Wanted to yeah, or maybe they'll just install Windows and treat it like a clean hard drive and they won't ever look at it.

776
00:54:09,893 --> 00:54:14,034
Scott: So now we'll talk about not so much deleting but Rym wanted to talk about Unpublishing right.

777
00:54:14,054 --> 00:54:15,819
Scott: So the first obviously we talk about unpublishing.

778
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,930
Scott: It's because you can't it's not possible to do this.

779
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:21,377
Scott: Yep, right as soon as you have some bits.

780
00:54:21,999 --> 00:54:25,730
Scott: if you send those bits out onto the internet somewhere, right?

781
00:54:26,073 --> 00:54:26,567
Scott: Guess what?

782
00:54:27,331 --> 00:54:29,426
Scott: You might as well just broadcast them the whole world.

783
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:29,909
Scott: deal with it.

784
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:33,244
Rym: So case in point my crazy archive of like everything.

785
00:54:33,707 --> 00:54:35,031
Rym: it's on my NAS Mm-hmm.

786
00:54:35,432 --> 00:54:38,501
Rym: And as a result, it is also mirrored onto Amazon Glacier.

787
00:54:38,521 --> 00:54:41,890
Rym: Okay, but it's not published because it's encrypted up there.

788
00:54:42,733 --> 00:54:45,263
Scott: So yeah, it was encrypted before it was sent there.

789
00:54:45,484 --> 00:54:46,930
Scott: Yeah, and it's sitting there encrypted.

790
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:51,064
Scott: So yeah, someone could get those encrypted bits, but because the keys are here.

791
00:54:51,084 --> 00:55:00,369
Scott: It's not actually published You don't need to unpublish it because if so, even as Amazon people open up Glacier and get the files out Yep They got a bunch of random nonsense.

792
00:55:00,591 --> 00:55:00,912
Rym: mostly.

793
00:55:00,932 --> 00:55:08,309
Rym: what this comes down to is the thorny question of if you have data on a service and You want to stop using that service?

794
00:55:08,771 --> 00:55:12,704
Rym: How do you know they actually remove your data if they even do you have to trust them?

795
00:55:12,985 --> 00:55:14,630
Scott: Yep, there's no way.

796
00:55:14,831 --> 00:55:16,376
Scott: Cloud is someone else's computer.

797
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:19,065
Scott: So it's I have my private photos and someone else's computer.

798
00:55:19,346 --> 00:55:20,470
Scott: I asked them to delete them.

799
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:23,012
Scott: They say they did The end.

800
00:55:23,313 --> 00:55:26,303
Rym: yep, and you might say oh, but what about things like snapchat?

801
00:55:26,383 --> 00:55:28,510
Rym: that the you you have to trust them.

802
00:55:29,411 --> 00:55:29,733
Rym: That's it.

803
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:30,195
Rym: You still have.

804
00:55:30,236 --> 00:55:32,045
Scott: you're just going on their word.

805
00:55:32,226 --> 00:55:32,990
Rym: You look at the code.

806
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:34,902
Rym: You know what they're doing unless you got.

807
00:55:35,223 --> 00:55:40,381
Scott: even if you see the code How do you know that's the code that's running on their server, yep They could have just shown you some other code.

808
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:42,655
Rym: look at Facebook and Cambridge Analytica and all.

809
00:55:42,695 --> 00:55:45,730
Scott: they let you come into their office and look at their server and examine it.

810
00:55:46,352 --> 00:55:47,135
Scott: How do you know that?

811
00:55:47,176 --> 00:55:48,802
Scott: that's the server that's actually being used?

812
00:55:48,863 --> 00:55:49,987
Scott: It's not some phony setup.

813
00:55:50,007 --> 00:55:50,893
Rym: Well, look at GeekNights Like.

814
00:55:50,933 --> 00:55:55,367
Rym: we won't even remove Comments in the old forum that is archived forever.

815
00:55:55,387 --> 00:56:08,230
Rym: Mm-hmm if you post it in there like tough nuts, you know, if you really had like I guess if someone came to us with like a Serious problem like being stalked by something we might go back into that database and like change the name on an account.

816
00:56:08,391 --> 00:56:10,970
Scott: I mean people would could change their own names and on their accounts.

817
00:56:11,513 --> 00:56:14,328
Scott: So like people had done that where I was like, no, I'm not deleting anything.

818
00:56:14,348 --> 00:56:18,010
Scott: Sorry I want to help you but you know, that's not a way that I can help you.

819
00:56:18,311 --> 00:56:26,259
Scott: They just changed their username to make it so that anyone searching for their old name wouldn't find them And they close their account and stop posting.

820
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:32,942
Rym: It's like if I delete my Flickr account, let's say Should Flickr be legally obligated to delete all my shit.

821
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:39,703
Scott: I mean if we're in charge of writing the law Mmm, it depends cuz at the same time running a forum.

822
00:56:40,044 --> 00:56:41,368
Rym: I don't want to delete cool data.

823
00:56:41,388 --> 00:56:45,586
Scott: No Right someone took a cool photo in your Flickr, right?

824
00:56:45,707 --> 00:56:46,048
Scott: It's like.

825
00:56:46,068 --> 00:56:52,548
Scott: well You know, I kind of don't want to delete that photo right the whole world should be able to experience that photo.

826
00:56:52,608 --> 00:56:53,270
Scott: It's so awesome.

827
00:56:53,651 --> 00:56:59,010
Scott: I like person who previously had already shared it with the world now wants to unshare it with the world.

828
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:02,360
Rym: I like the idea of a new class of copyright.

829
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:03,363
Rym: I just thought of this now.

830
00:57:03,644 --> 00:57:03,864
Scott: Uh-huh.

831
00:57:04,225 --> 00:57:04,586
Scott: Okay.

832
00:57:04,827 --> 00:57:06,728
Scott: I'm sure it's a great idea You just thought of now.

833
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:09,859
Rym: So here's my basic idea because this is kind of like something like.

834
00:57:09,879 --> 00:57:11,163
Rym: so I want to.

835
00:57:11,244 --> 00:57:16,091
Rym: when I die and this is in my Will but I want I get updated because it's Mr.

836
00:57:16,131 --> 00:57:19,646
Rym: Willow basically a public domain is mine to all my email account everything.

837
00:57:19,706 --> 00:57:20,008
Rym: Fuck it.

838
00:57:20,028 --> 00:57:20,449
Rym: Here you go.

839
00:57:20,671 --> 00:57:23,350
Rym: Yeah, the world can read every email remember sent.

840
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:32,250
Scott: Well, I mean I got like, you know instructions like here is how to get into every one of my accounts and get all my Stuffs and you know because someone might need to my emails to manage my stuff when I'm dead.

841
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:38,093
Rym: I like the idea of there being a class of copyright law Above and beyond.

842
00:57:38,133 --> 00:57:43,228
Rym: public domain may be called like the public trust or something or the public time trial.

843
00:57:43,248 --> 00:57:44,030
Scott: things probably exist.

844
00:57:44,243 --> 00:57:47,323
Rym: No But imagine so I there's would have to be a government run service.

845
00:57:47,383 --> 00:57:48,910
Rym: can't trust some tech startup to do this.

846
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:50,739
Scott: Send it the Internet archive say archive.

847
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:50,940
Scott: No.

848
00:57:50,980 --> 00:58:05,266
Rym: No, I want the ability to Basically send data to a government service that is encrypted and unlocks Something like some number of years after your death and there's laws protecting it.

849
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:07,909
Rym: so you could say Here is data.

850
00:58:08,612 --> 00:58:13,566
Scott: Why don't we start that service and then not actually unlock anything because the dead people can't sue?

851
00:58:14,268 --> 00:58:15,050
Rym: that's not a bad idea.

852
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:16,885
Rym: That's like saying selling rapture insurance.

853
00:58:17,228 --> 00:58:27,030
Rym: Yes Yeah, but I do like the idea of like services that get users data being obligated to unpublish it At least from the things they control if someone quits their service.

854
00:58:27,351 --> 00:58:34,290
Rym: But I also like the idea that like 50 years after that person's death that data is out again.

855
00:58:34,491 --> 00:58:42,039
Rym: Like get past the point where it's going likely to harm people and have a way To put data into the public trust on a time-delayed fashion.

856
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:53,290
Scott: Hmm If someone posts a cool YouTube video and it's cool It's worth seeing and then they decide that they want to delete it from the internet.

857
00:58:53,632 --> 00:58:55,669
Scott: Like there's that guy who deleted all this code from the internet.

858
00:58:56,653 --> 00:58:58,280
Scott: You know, I've been a few guys like that.

859
00:58:59,003 --> 00:58:59,364
Scott: Guess what?

860
00:58:59,444 --> 00:58:59,866
Scott: It's out there.

861
00:58:59,886 --> 00:59:00,448
Scott: Everyone's got it.

862
00:59:00,468 --> 00:59:03,519
Rym: It's too late Yeah, but how do you know what we it was worth?

863
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:06,710
Rym: We've never been able to find that fuck his head thing.

864
00:59:08,491 --> 00:59:09,015
Scott: Remember that?

865
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:09,941
Scott: why didn't you save it?

866
00:59:11,791 --> 00:59:13,641
Rym: Because it was some flash thing and I didn't save.

867
00:59:13,781 --> 00:59:15,389

00:59:19,525 --> 00:59:20,409
Scott: Why didn't you back up?

870
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:24,523

880
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:48,895
Scott: There are things that are good to be gone.

881
00:59:49,256 --> 00:59:53,290
Scott: I said, I usually I think it's immoral to delete data, but not all day.

Rym: You'll not be named.

888
01:00:17,215 --> 01:00:21,410
Rym: in the hopes that we would all eventually actually forget this person's name.

889
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:27,336
Scott: I thought we were just saying he who shall not be named because a it was funny and be used to Remind you how gross the first.
