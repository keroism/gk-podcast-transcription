11
00:00:43,455 --> 00:00:45,040
Scott: It is in New York City history.

12
00:00:46,063 --> 00:00:48,149
Scott: It says 85 degrees, but that's fine.

13
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,701
Rym: My watch says 89 or 87 87.

14
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:53,188
Rym: Yeah, anyway, it is 87 right now.

15
00:00:53,228 --> 00:00:54,434
Rym: The high was 89. according.

16
00:00:54,454 --> 00:01:00,009
Scott: point is I Neglectfully forgot the yesterday.

17
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:01,876
Scott: I was the first of me.

18
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:08,297
Scott: Oh outdoor fucking Mm-hmm Weather's just in time.

19
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:09,542
Rym: it's.

20
00:01:09,763 --> 00:01:16,928
Rym: uh, it was a good day because you know, I started a new job and Yeah, you wonder why we've been busy.

21
00:01:16,968 --> 00:01:29,011
Rym: there's been a lot of life changes in the Rym and Scott households, but As you know in my last job, I'd biked to work every day and it was like a seven ish mile ride So like 25 to 28 minutes,

22
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:31,560
Scott: let me check on the Strava how long the ride was to work today.

23
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:36,517
Rym: Yeah, so but I'd bike hard and get sweaty and wear shorts and everything and I had it like it.

24
00:01:36,938 --> 00:01:42,736
Rym: in New York There's always this minefield of will your building let you bike even though the law says they have to?

25
00:01:42,756 --> 00:01:43,860
Rym: there's a lot of loopholes in.

26
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,831
Scott: Well, oh, it's not about the it's not always about the building.

27
00:01:46,851 --> 00:01:49,020
Rym: But anyway, yeah, maybe your employer might just suck.

28
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:57,513
Scott: And anyway, so this morning to the new work, which is seven point two miles It took me 39 minutes from my home on the slow heavy bike.

29
00:01:57,633 --> 00:02:06,415
Scott: No and to get to Rym's house Okay to get to Rym's house which is much closer than my house from work took 30 minutes in his 5.3 mile.

30
00:02:06,535 --> 00:02:14,366
Rym: it took me to get home 12 minutes to bike the 3.2 miles to get home.

31
00:02:14,747 --> 00:02:14,867
Rym: Mm-hmm.

32
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,673
Rym: That's a real nice bike.

33
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:18,298
Rym: What's interesting is it takes me years?

34
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,906
Scott: Oh my god That's not as unfairly close.

35
00:02:21,006 --> 00:02:22,651
Rym: Yeah, I'm telling you you're cheating.

36
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:25,459
Rym: Oh even better if we move offices, I'll be here.

37
00:02:26,144 --> 00:02:26,345
Scott: What?

38
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,247
Scott: Oh at 59, yeah Building with the weird.

39
00:02:30,688 --> 00:02:34,260
Rym: Yep, that would mean I think I would literally just bike over the bridge.

40
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,248
Rym: I'm at work if I go to the version of home.

41
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,059
Rym: It'll be like seven minutes tops.

42
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:44,900
Scott: The difference is when you bike you try to go fast only on the way home.

43
00:02:45,343 --> 00:02:47,780
Rym: I don't want to show up to work all huffing and puffing and sweaty.

44
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:51,733
Scott: I basically even when I'm biking like on the weekend with the biking group.

45
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:56,753
Scott: I never huff or puff But not even as if I feel any.

46
00:02:57,075 --> 00:03:03,655
Rym: but like dynamite I'm huffing and puffing in the community if I feel any like difficulty or strain.

47
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:07,888
Scott: or you know exercise Happening gear down to slow down.

48
00:03:07,908 --> 00:03:11,442
Rym: This is why I took you like two more hours to do the Hudson Valley Well ride.

49
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,767
Scott: they take me more hours.

50
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:15,759
Rym: It was a long time before you rolled in.

51
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,563
Rym: No, it was.

52
00:03:16,604 --> 00:03:22,305
Rym: I'd already eaten like a full dinner and had a couple beers Mm-hmm But I got huff and puff.

53
00:03:22,365 --> 00:03:25,821
Rym: I bike hard and fast wherever I am unless I have a reason not to you like I'm with other People.

54
00:03:26,223 --> 00:03:26,364
Rym: Mm-hmm.

55
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:27,268
Rym: I like it.

56
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,840
Rym: I still do that thing where I run everywhere if I have a good excuse.

57
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:32,445
Rym: And I'm doing a thing at work now.

58
00:03:32,786 --> 00:03:36,560
Rym: So I try to not ever use the elevator in the high-rise.

59
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:38,614
Scott: How what floor is your office?

60
00:03:38,655 --> 00:03:38,958
Rym: So previously?

61
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,087
Rym: I'm previously at rooms job.

62
00:03:42,328 --> 00:03:43,193
Rym: I was on the tenth floor.

63
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:44,097
Scott: That's a little too high.

64
00:03:44,218 --> 00:03:44,680
Rym: That's fine.

65
00:03:44,761 --> 00:03:46,574
Rym: That's like a five minute walk up.

66
00:03:46,614 --> 00:03:53,932
Rym: Like it wasn't a big deal I used to be a little like out of breath by the time I got to the eighth or ninth floor But now up ten like no big deal.

67
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:57,334
Rym: I'm just skipping steps is fine We moved up to the 18th floor.

68
00:03:57,414 --> 00:04:02,969
Rym: Let me tell you 18 8 10 18 8 10.

69
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:03,460
Scott: You know what?

70
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:11,060
Rym: But it's even worse because the 13th floor is where there's like the unlimited food and coffee and stuff.

71
00:04:11,302 --> 00:04:13,840
Rym: So now I'm going up and I hit 13.

72
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,764
Rym: It's like a fuck it.

73
00:04:14,804 --> 00:04:16,892
Rym: and I go and get like some breakfast that I take the elevator.

74
00:04:16,914 --> 00:04:19,786
Scott: the rest of my previous work was On the seventh floor, right?

75
00:04:19,846 --> 00:04:21,975
Scott: But guess what are the eighth floor?

76
00:04:22,015 --> 00:04:22,276
Scott: I think.

77
00:04:22,356 --> 00:04:25,106
Scott: but anyway, yep My apartment is on the third floor.

78
00:04:25,627 --> 00:04:28,597
Scott: Your apartment is on the third floor right my new work.

79
00:04:28,697 --> 00:04:29,720
Scott: Guess what third floor?

80
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,101
Scott: That's right.

81
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:33,440
Scott: And whenever I get so weird whenever I get an elevator, I only got to push three.

82
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,850
Scott: I don't got to push no other buttons only threes and ones.

83
00:04:35,991 --> 00:04:37,377
Scott: Yeah, we got to push nothing else.

84
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:39,166
Scott: no matter where I go I can't forget dude.

85
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:40,252
Scott: It's either three or one.

86
00:04:40,373 --> 00:04:43,350
Rym: to this fucking day Two jobs ago.

87
00:04:43,752 --> 00:04:45,280
Rym: My company was on a certain floor.

88
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,115
Rym: I will if I'm really tired and not paying attention when I'm going to work anywhere.

89
00:04:50,576 --> 00:04:51,680
Rym: I'll hit that floor number.

90
00:04:51,961 --> 00:04:54,700
Rym: Yeah, I haven't worked at that place in like a decade.

91
00:04:55,021 --> 00:05:00,792
Scott: This is why it's real good to have one of those fancy buildings like the building Microsoft is in where when you go to the Front desk.

92
00:05:00,874 --> 00:05:02,728
Rym: Oh, yeah You just tell me what floor you're going.

93
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:03,110
Rym: or if you're

94
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:17,950
Scott: an employee you waive your card at this Turnstyle and then an elevator comes with no buttons on it And knows that a person going to floor 12 or whatever has gone through the turnstile and an elevator comes Programmed to go to that floor and no other.

95
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:18,914
Rym: Oh, it's even better.

96
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:26,947
Scott: or it's not only secure It is also convenient which is great because usually security, you know Usually means a decrease in convenience.

97
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:39,436
Scott: that technology of the elevator with no buttons is a dramatic security increase along with a Dramatic convenience increase like any hotel that has that will literally never have the checkout problem at a con again.

98
00:05:39,496 --> 00:05:49,405
Scott: The only problem is People who don't know know if you if you go through the turnstile, right and the elevator comes and you don't get on Are you just trapped.

99
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:52,640
Scott: you have to go back out and then go back into the turnstile again?

100
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,559
Scott: Yeah, there isn't like a place to waive your bar.

101
00:05:56,062 --> 00:06:09,940
Rym: So a cool thing about the building I'm in now and actually a lot of the buildings here They're double-decker elevators so the elevator stops at two floors at any given time and Algorithms just manage that as the elevator is two cars one on top of each.

102
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,180
Scott: Oh, yeah, so we can open on floor one and two at the same.

103
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:13,920
Scott: Yeah.

104
00:06:14,021 --> 00:06:17,720
Rym: And then it goes up and it just cleverly tries to multiplex the ride.

105
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:23,930
Scott: So you might but you might be say in a car stopped while the people above it's rare though It avoids that when it can.

106
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,379
Scott: it might as well open the doors.

107
00:06:26,023 --> 00:06:32,294
Rym: Yeah, so the other thing is and just because the kind of company I work for now They really want people to walk because it's good for you.

108
00:06:32,314 --> 00:06:32,937
Rym: Mm-hmm.

109
00:06:33,138 --> 00:06:48,150
Rym: So elevators by default unless you have a special access card that says you have made it like Privately if it basically flags you as some sort of disability or reason why you should be able to pick your floor Elevators only go to odd or even floors.

110
00:06:48,813 --> 00:06:58,658
Rym: So you got to use the stairs Unless you're real lucky and you're on an odd-numbered floor because then you can get to the food floor and your office and theoretically never Have to use the stairs.

111
00:06:59,621 --> 00:07:04,860
Scott: One final thing there's some health insurance companies in the US now giving discounts to people who do enough exercise.

112
00:07:05,683 --> 00:07:12,620
Scott: You know like there's things that you can put in your car that will monitor your car and see that you drive safely Yeah, and give you a discount on your car insurance.

113
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:19,220
Scott: Yeah They're doing the same thing where it's like where a Fitbit equivalent device and we'll check the data on it as if you're healthy enough.

114
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:20,867
Scott: We'll give you just kind of hell dude.

115
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:26,324
Rym: I get a credit because I bike to work sometimes but most of them are Really just like pedometers.

116
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:33,894
Scott: Yeah people on Amazon are selling devices that will shake your pedometer to give you the health insurance discount without exercising.

117
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:38,649
Rym: that is Amazing and very American.

118
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,620
Rym: Yes both sides of that conversation.

119
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,130
Rym: But uh, where's that going with that?

120
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:45,955
Rym: I don't know all we got.

121
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:47,401
Scott: go to the go to the news All right.

122
00:07:47,422 --> 00:07:53,880
Rym: So in the news, there's actually some pretty interesting news about Hasbro and the Power Rangers.

123
00:07:54,201 --> 00:08:12,408
Scott: right, so right it seems like in the world of the US at least all of the popular culture nerd properties right are being gobbled up by Disney and or Hasbro, which is extra complicated because Did Hasbro already has the rights to.

124
00:08:12,549 --> 00:08:15,940
Rym: I most like Disney princesses like Disney stuff.

125
00:08:16,582 --> 00:08:20,354
Rym: So if Disney gets something has basically has a real has a lacy difference over that.

126
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:25,610
Scott: well license to like toys Right this version doing license licensing and owning.

127
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:31,529
Scott: Yeah, it's like Disney owns fucking Star Wars Right, but they don't make the Star Wars toys.

128
00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:32,171
Scott: Someone else makes.

129
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,535
Rym: well Hasbro makes them.

130
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:38,580
Rym: Oh, yeah Disclosure I own a lot of Hasbro stock.

131
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:43,179
Rym: I've been buying Hasbro stock for like a decade and I'm continuing to buy it for reasons like this Rym's.

132
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,564
Scott: Eventually, it's gonna own Hasbro.

133
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:54,492
Rym: Well, holy but surely, uh, and my current rate of buying when I'm a hundred and thirty years old give or take you'll own like a fraction of a percent.

134
00:08:54,733 --> 00:09:09,380
Rym: I'll own enough to where I could actually Vote in a proxy election and if it was real close You One day so that the Hasbro executives are gonna call ribbon be like, huh?

135
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,952
Scott: Who you thinking of voting for for the board Rym's?

136
00:09:10,992 --> 00:09:11,900
Scott: a 90 year old man?

137
00:09:12,082 --> 00:09:13,739
Scott: They're all like these 40 year old executive.

138
00:09:15,342 --> 00:09:18,840
Scott: He's like son my save games older than your grandpa.

139
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,137
Scott: Don't try to tell me who to vote for.

140
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:31,260
Rym: My goal in life is to walk into Hasbro's office vote in one shareholder election and then immediately collapse into a skeleton.

141
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:33,379
Scott: And they'll make a toy skeleton.

142
00:09:35,162 --> 00:09:35,929
Rym: That's my one vote.

143
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:37,159
Rym: You got to make it skeleton Rym.

144
00:09:38,462 --> 00:09:41,078
Scott: All toys then will just be cyber it constructions.

145
00:09:41,138 --> 00:09:43,406
Rym: anyway Your hands.

146
00:09:43,447 --> 00:09:43,788
Rym: What is this?

147
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:44,451
Rym: a baby game?

148
00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:46,460
Scott: You'll be going to their virtual executive.

149
00:09:47,907 --> 00:09:48,896
Scott: You have to hack your way in.

150
00:09:50,522 --> 00:09:54,160
Rym: But yeah this there's a lot of things going on here.

151
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:59,580
Scott: But yeah Hasbro bought the Power Rangers from Saban Saban, however, you pronounce it, right?

152
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,467
Scott: Yeah, they didn't license it or any like.

153
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:06,632
Scott: they now own it the same way they own Watsy and Transformers and My Little Pony.

154
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:10,830
Rym: they fucking own it Meaning they can make the shows they can.

155
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:15,414
Scott: so if you want to make a Power Rangers movie You have to buy a license from Hasbro.

156
00:10:15,474 --> 00:10:22,693
Scott: if they want to make Power Rangers and My Little Pony Transformers crossovers guess what they can just fucking do it if they want.

157
00:10:22,774 --> 00:10:24,259
Scott: you can't stop them because they own it all.

158
00:10:24,521 --> 00:10:26,880
Rym: Yeah, they probably will and it's real interesting.

159
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,703
Rym: This is all happening.

160
00:10:27,743 --> 00:10:35,633
Scott: people that they currently licensed to like IDW who makes all the pony Transformers GI Joe comics, I think they also make.

161
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:37,500
Scott: they might even already make Power Rangers comics.

162
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,276
Scott: I bet who makes the Power Rangers comics, but guess what if the IDW doesn't already?

163
00:10:41,316 --> 00:10:42,240
Scott: they're going too soon.

164
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:45,118
Scott: Yeah, you can expect any place that you currently see.

165
00:10:45,722 --> 00:10:48,639
Scott: Hasbro stuff the Power Rangers you get in that mix.

166
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,875
Scott: You'll probably go home and you're probably watch My Little Pony on the hub.

167
00:10:51,936 --> 00:10:52,720
Scott: Is that still a network?

168
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:53,965
Rym: I don't even know.

169
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:54,712
Scott: I don't even know anymore.

170
00:10:54,954 --> 00:11:12,368
Rym: but Power Rangers Hasbro is down right now because of an unrelated thing because as you all recall Toys R Us is gone bye-bye and It's while it's not gone for any good reason.

171
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:15,536
Rym: like the reasons why Toys R Us actually went bankrupt are just really fucked up.

172
00:11:15,737 --> 00:11:21,540
Rym: Yeah, but Because the last national toy chain is gone.

173
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:24,933
Rym: That's really hurting Hasbro's sort of short-term value.

174
00:11:25,214 --> 00:11:26,900
Scott: and the guys market cares about short-term.

175
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,094
Scott: But Rym who's gonna be 90 to get his one vote?

176
00:11:29,436 --> 00:11:33,889
Rym: Yeah Short I am not giving investment advice.

177
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,400
Rym: do not construe anything that I'm saying as investment advice.

178
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:38,664
Rym: I swear to fucking God.

179
00:11:39,026 --> 00:11:44,062
Rym: do not do not talk to me about this, but don't do it done in brim Don't does.

180
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:48,294
Rym: but I am continuing to buy a lot of Hasbro stock now that it's down.

181
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:55,905
Rym: just cuz someone does something does not mean They're suggesting that you do that thing cuz I also drink a lot of poison and huff and puff on a bike Sometimes not wearing a helmet.

182
00:11:55,965 --> 00:12:00,702
Scott: So yes, I Don't wear a helmet if I ride a city bike, but on a city bike There's even.

183
00:12:00,722 --> 00:12:03,134
Rym: I already don't feel like the city bike.

184
00:12:03,194 --> 00:12:04,420
Rym: I should be wearing a helmet.

185
00:12:04,701 --> 00:12:09,120
Scott: I or I already don't huff and puff on a road bike on a city bike.

186
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,550
Scott: I even know how do I somehow negative huff city bike.

187
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,836
Rym: I fought and fuck city bike.

188
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,280
Rym: I'm rarely even in that top gear.

189
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:17,532
Rym: I'm just like putter.

190
00:12:17,552 --> 00:12:17,775
Rym: putter.

191
00:12:17,815 --> 00:12:21,360
Scott: putter Like the city bike is just so heavy and slow.

192
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:22,800
Rym: That's not a thing.

193
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,265
Scott: I'm not gonna carry a helmet with me.

194
00:12:24,366 --> 00:12:28,140
Rym: not a single drop of sweat is gonna come from my brow on a city bike.

195
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,450
Rym: I'll tell you why I used one the other day.

196
00:12:30,771 --> 00:12:34,631
Rym: cuz yesterday I didn't bring my bike to work and it was so nice I was like fuck it and I took a city bike home.

197
00:12:34,993 --> 00:12:36,020
Scott: Yeah, well, you're close enough.

198
00:12:36,262 --> 00:12:37,472
Scott: Yeah for me it'd be cutting it.

199
00:12:37,734 --> 00:12:42,160
Scott: I could I could do it I could make it all the way to work in one ride without docking but it would be close.

200
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,496
Scott: Cuz I mean I'd lose time because it's a big heavy but even better because I bought the day pass.

201
00:12:46,677 --> 00:12:46,958
Rym: it was 24 hours.

202
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:48,448
Rym: So later that night.

203
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,840
Scott: Oh, you don't have a permanent thing.

204
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:51,130
Rym: I used to and I cancel it.

205
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:51,875
Rym: cuz they doubled the price.

206
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:52,480
Rym: I might get it back.

207
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:53,807
Scott: So I paid for it.

208
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:55,275
Rym: right but I paid for it back.

209
00:12:55,295 --> 00:12:57,445
Rym: It was like a hundred bucks But you know what my new job.

210
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,108
Scott: they pay for it.

211
00:12:58,148 --> 00:13:00,640
Scott: So as soon as it expires, I just renew it for free.

212
00:13:01,043 --> 00:13:06,451
Rym: I'm not gonna get it again cuz They're screening Porco Rosso at Kips Bay.

213
00:13:06,472 --> 00:13:07,355
Scott: Just watched it.

214
00:13:07,857 --> 00:13:08,800
Rym: I haven't watched it in a while.

215
00:13:09,008 --> 00:13:10,607
Rym: Okay so I might go see the fact.

216
00:13:10,668 --> 00:13:21,785
Scott: I gave a computer to George and I left my Porco Rosso DVD in the DVD player and then he's like, oh we watching this and I'm like, oh good Good thing I left it in there.

217
00:13:21,805 --> 00:13:22,748
Rym: He was just asking me.

218
00:13:22,808 --> 00:13:24,293
Rym: He wants all my old computers too.

219
00:13:24,855 --> 00:13:25,437
Scott: Good take them.

220
00:13:25,598 --> 00:13:28,934
Rym: Yeah Start mining those bitcoins or whatever you're gonna do.

221
00:13:29,015 --> 00:13:32,900
Scott: I don't know what you can do with them But please take all of my unused technology.

222
00:13:33,942 --> 00:13:39,480
Rym: So in some other news more of a geek bite Scott I want to review this on GeekNights But I gotta get Scott to watch it first.

223
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:48,182
Rym: Emily I have been watching on Judas recommendation and also the Internet's recommendation because this is one of those things we talked about with judge Anime by its cover.

224
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:57,679
Rym: I ignore a lot of anime even if I'm positively inclined toward it unless people keep talking about it and People keep talking about made in abyss.

225
00:13:58,883 --> 00:14:00,518
Rym: So I felt like I had to watch it.

226
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:05,378
Rym: So I watched one episode and it was intriguing enough to watch the rest and I'm almost done with it.

227
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:05,900
Rym: It's not long.

228
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,833
Rym: It's like 10 or 11 at 13 episodes the season supposedly.

229
00:14:09,853 --> 00:14:15,220
Rym: I haven't seen the end yet, but supposedly it ends in a reasonable place unlike say attack on Titan.

230
00:14:16,861 --> 00:14:22,480
Rym: And what I have to say about it is that if you're an anime fan, it is definitely worth watching.

231
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:24,370
Rym: I'm really enjoying it.

232
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,639
Rym: I think Scott will really like it.

233
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:28,092
Rym: It reminds me of the good parts of Jew.

234
00:14:28,192 --> 00:14:31,087
Scott: Oh say if you remember that show I remember there was a show called you.

235
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:34,863
Rym: Oh, so that was owners like the brothers on the planet with the plants It'll eat you.

236
00:14:34,883 --> 00:14:36,850
Scott: Oh, I thought that was number nine.

237
00:14:36,871 --> 00:14:38,757
Scott: I don't know anymore.

238
00:14:38,818 --> 00:14:41,466
Rym: number six Yeah, I can play.

239
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:41,947
Rym: I can play it.

240
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:43,652
Rym: all these shows together because I can't.

241
00:14:44,214 --> 00:14:53,360
Rym: anyway the show is plants to eat people but coupled with Secret of Mana Like a secret of mana's got cute slimies.

242
00:14:53,647 --> 00:15:04,860
Rym: Yeah so imagine a show that is the terrible secret of space which is there's this pit and It no one knows how deep it goes and it's called the abyss.

243
00:15:05,942 --> 00:15:09,760
Rym: And like Dragon Quest everything is like cute Dragon Quest looking characters.

244
00:15:10,181 --> 00:15:15,320
Rym: Everything's set up like an RPG with people like upgrading their equipment and like levels.

245
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,511
Scott: You know what delicious and dungeon is a lot like that.

246
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:21,653
Scott: only it's about eating the monsters But it's still about going deeper in the dungeon into different.

247
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:22,859
Rym: but the deal with this show?

248
00:15:23,825 --> 00:15:26,479
Rym: I'm not gonna spoil anything, but here's the real deal.

249
00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:28,987
Rym: This pit is Golgotharoth.

250
00:15:29,469 --> 00:15:39,255
Rym: This might as well just be the prequel to the prince of nothing But it's framed in that there's these kids who live in this town.

251
00:15:39,295 --> 00:15:39,696
Rym: That's on the edge.

252
00:15:39,716 --> 00:15:41,140
Scott: Is it Golgotharoth or is it?

253
00:15:42,263 --> 00:15:44,766
Scott: You know Lord of the Rings.

254
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:45,770
Rym: It's Golgotharoth.

255
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,380
Rym: Okay, like specifically it's a pit.

256
00:15:48,681 --> 00:16:02,965
Rym: There's like a probably an alien ship buried down there and the story is there's this orphanage and kids in the orphanage Are forced to go down into this pit and bring back artifacts and if they grow up and survive They eventually level up.

257
00:16:03,206 --> 00:16:17,460
Rym: and now they're employees of this thing that goes down deeper into the pit to bring up artifacts and they don't really understand how the artifacts work, but they use them and If you go the further down you go the harder it is to come back up because it starts fucking with you.

258
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,548
Scott: I mean, that's how all holes are now.

259
00:16:19,588 --> 00:16:22,880
Scott: Like can you tell me a hole that is it buddy where that rule is?

260
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:28,000
Rym: No, we're talking like go down a hundred feet trying to walk back up ten feet.

261
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,823
Rym: You start getting sick.

262
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:29,746
Rym: walk back up twenty feet.

263
00:16:29,787 --> 00:16:30,569
Rym: You start vomiting.

264
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:31,854
Rym: walk out fifty feet.

265
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:33,420
Rym: blood starts coming out of your eyes.

266
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:36,440
Scott: Yeah, I mean that might be harder than a normal hole.

267
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,979
Scott: Yeah, the same is true in a normal hole the farther you go down the harder it is to get back up.

268
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:46,075
Rym: But it's framed in this like very cute JRPG like Secret of Mana looking way.

269
00:16:46,115 --> 00:16:53,485
Rym: It's a Japanese fantasy show Yeah, but unlike a lot of these shows that have nothing going on Really feeling it.

270
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:54,732
Rym: Okay, really good.

271
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:55,878
Rym: I've thoroughly enjoyed it.

272
00:16:56,581 --> 00:16:58,228
Scott: It's I just want to watch a Gretzky co.

273
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:58,911
Rym: but did.

274
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:00,800
Rym: oh, we're gonna wash the shit out of a Gretzky co.

275
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,166
Rym: It is a plus as well.

276
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:04,276
Scott: But yeah, you watched any of it.

277
00:17:04,336 --> 00:17:05,140
Rym: I watched one episode.

278
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,385
Rym: I'm gonna watch again with Emily.

279
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:08,093
Rym: It is a Gretzky co.

280
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:12,310
Rym: if I had to give the shortest geek fight possible There is a lot more to it than you would have guessed.

281
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:13,093
Scott: Mm-hmm.

282
00:17:13,314 --> 00:17:14,900
Rym: It is a. it's a legit show.

283
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:20,989
Rym: It isn't just DMC which as much as I loved it DMC is basically just the same joke over and over again.

284
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:22,413
Scott: The DMC manga is a complete.

285
00:17:22,714 --> 00:17:28,450
Rym: Yeah, but aggressive co Feels like it'll be very simple jokes and it's not.

286
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,115
Rym: it's actually a pretty good character drama.

287
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:34,710
Rym: Mm-hmm But made in abyss is good And way dark.

288
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,480
Rym: like one of the things is these kids?

289
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:43,200
Rym: Like the environmental storytelling like they find one of the things that they find and no one knows what they are is skeletons.

290
00:17:44,103 --> 00:17:49,377
Scott: Oh, this is why you like this show all around this pit like everywhere people who tried to walk up from 200 feet.

291
00:17:52,983 --> 00:17:56,898
Scott: What if you're just down there like let's say you're a thousand you just stay sure.

292
00:17:56,918 --> 00:17:59,192
Scott: no No, I'm saying you're a thousand feet deep right?

293
00:17:59,292 --> 00:18:03,152
Scott: Oh and just like you jump You just jump in place.

294
00:18:03,193 --> 00:18:03,556
Scott: Do you like?

295
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,667
Scott: Disintegrate from going up a little bit.

296
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:10,598
Rym: So I don't know because the characters I am following are only in the fourth level.

297
00:18:10,638 --> 00:18:15,168
Rym: now There are four levels down Which is way beyond what normal people do.

298
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:21,372
Rym: and the people who are allowed to go down there like the black whistles or the white Whistles, they're all fucked up non men.

299
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:25,264
Rym: now, like they've been fucked up by this stuff Yeah But they'll keep.

300
00:18:25,284 --> 00:18:29,475
Rym: they keep finding just thousands and thousands and thousands of skeletons.

301
00:18:29,636 --> 00:18:33,006
Rym: nice and they're all Buried in the same way.

302
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:37,500
Rym: They look like they're praying and they're all facing toward the center of the abyss and they're so old.

303
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:38,731
Rym: No one knows what the deal is.

304
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:40,323
Rym: Mm-hmm It's fun stuck.

305
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:43,978
Rym: It's this is a good show and there's a reason why everyone's talking about it.

306
00:18:49,372 --> 00:18:54,290
Rym: But anyway things of the day we got a double thing of the day feature.

307
00:18:55,594 --> 00:19:03,033
Scott: well, one of them is a thing of Remix thing of the day and one of them is a just the unoriginal a thing from the olden days that's not remixed at all,

308
00:19:03,193 --> 00:19:17,842
Rym: so I found this because the the the sort of the buried lead here is that all those Psychedelic Awesome shorts from Sesame Street in the back back in the day they're all just on YouTube like all of them and they're amazing.

309
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:33,497
Rym: and I've been watching them when I'm bored and It's shocking to me how little I remember some of them until I hear that first note and suddenly my brain remembers every single Possible detail of this animation.

310
00:19:33,517 --> 00:19:33,918
Rym: Mm-hmm.

311
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,468
Rym: But this one is one that has been stuck in my head for the last 36 years.

312
00:19:39,232 --> 00:19:41,229
Rym: It is the Sesame Street pinball song.

313
00:19:42,052 --> 00:19:49,370
Rym: This is a remix of the Sesame Street pinball song with the animation also remixed and it's pretty great.

314
00:19:50,012 --> 00:19:52,040
Scott: Yeah, I mean the original song is already great.

315
00:19:52,281 --> 00:19:58,460
Scott: Yeah, so while talking about things that are great This video reminded me of another Sesame Street video.

316
00:19:58,982 --> 00:20:01,990
Scott: So we searched for it and there it was the king of eight.

317
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,998
Scott: He's really great too, but he's not remixed.

318
00:20:04,118 --> 00:20:07,050
Scott: It's just the king of eight official Sesame Street YouTube channel.

319
00:20:08,872 --> 00:20:15,414
Scott: And the king of eight has the same exact vault voice as the Muppet Rolf the piano playing dog, which is Obvious.

320
00:20:16,077 --> 00:20:16,218
Scott: Whoo.

321
00:20:16,238 --> 00:20:17,365
Scott: Take out those hot princesses.

322
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:33,724
Rym: Yeah, I feel like these Sesame Street shorts were a big foundational part of my life and I'm starting to notice as I'm older that Between like these and things like Donald Duck in math magic land and the anime I watched when I was a little little kid.

323
00:20:33,744 --> 00:20:38,024
Scott: I Like it's.

324
00:20:38,105 --> 00:20:45,410
Scott: you know It's hard not to draw a connection between the aesthetic of these and the aesthetic that I like in artworks today.

325
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:51,249
Rym: Yep, I do really like late 60s early 70s semi psychedelic stuff.

326
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:57,338
Rym: Then the minute moment the GeekNights book club book remains Homer's the Odyssey.

327
00:20:57,781 --> 00:20:57,922
Rym: Mmm.

328
00:20:58,103 --> 00:21:01,830
Rym: I got a bunch of travel coming up So I'm gonna finish it in the next month or so if not sooner.

329
00:21:01,992 --> 00:21:03,349
Scott: I thought you had finished it and we're waiting for me.

330
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:04,434
Rym: No, I slide.

331
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:08,730
Rym: I stopped reading to wait for you to start reading again, but I'm all well on my way.

332
00:21:09,472 --> 00:21:15,430
Scott: I'm probably gonna read, you know, but I'm chillin in the park laying down in the Sun with the grass and such.

333
00:21:15,762 --> 00:21:15,909
Rym: Yep.

334
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:25,505
Rym: I'm gonna read on trips cuz uh, although the part of the meta moment is that I'm going to be Scottless in Lancaster, Pennsylvania this weekend for Zenkai counter.

335
00:21:25,545 --> 00:21:30,400
Rym: I'm doing three panels Anime openers from around the world which important point.

336
00:21:30,762 --> 00:21:32,970
Rym: This is the last time I'm running this fucking panel.

337
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:41,966
Rym: Thank God, I've run this so many versions of it so many years and it is not feasible for me to make new versions of it.

338
00:21:42,489 --> 00:21:44,396
Rym: and Because I can't put it on YouTube.

339
00:21:44,777 --> 00:21:48,290
Rym: I'm increasingly unwilling to make content that I can't put on the internet.

340
00:21:49,311 --> 00:21:50,997
Rym: So I'm letting that ship sail.

341
00:21:51,017 --> 00:21:54,370
Rym: This is the final performance of anime openers from around the world.

342
00:21:54,952 --> 00:21:56,158
Rym: I got a couple of little gems.

343
00:21:56,198 --> 00:21:58,267
Rym: I'm gonna share but that's it.

344
00:21:58,368 --> 00:22:00,354
Rym: I'm done Underrated anime.

345
00:22:00,394 --> 00:22:04,229
Rym: you should see the first brand new GeekNights anime panel in a long goddamn time.

346
00:22:04,731 --> 00:22:05,214
Scott: It's anime.

347
00:22:05,234 --> 00:22:08,950
Scott: You should see only ones that he just cut the list apart to be different.

348
00:22:09,952 --> 00:22:11,236
Rym: I'm really because I looked.

349
00:22:11,718 --> 00:22:14,830
Rym: every anime panel we've got has bullshit old slide.

350
00:22:14,951 --> 00:22:17,241
Rym: So I'm making this like we make modern panels.

351
00:22:17,884 --> 00:22:21,140
Rym: So I'm making it from scratch and Apocalypse zero is in there.

352
00:22:21,744 --> 00:22:22,328
Scott: No, it's not.

353
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:24,436
Scott: Nor is it underrated?

354
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,765
Rym: I feel like everyone needs to see it exactly once.

355
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:29,094
Rym: no when they're an adult No, they know.

356
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:35,494
Rym: no that is that type of anime is an important Area of anime.

357
00:22:35,634 --> 00:22:43,377
Rym: no and knowing what the fuck it's deal is if you're gonna watch one of those fucked up violent weird ass old Anime, I feel like that's the one.

358
00:22:43,517 --> 00:22:46,366
Rym: no, I mean name in that genre.

359
00:22:46,427 --> 00:22:51,570
Scott: name a better show to watch The educational channel, which is turning TV off and go outside.

360
00:22:52,152 --> 00:22:55,946
Rym: I mean we said people should play pandemic legacy in our 40 tabletop games.

361
00:22:55,986 --> 00:22:56,709
Rym: I don't like that shit.

362
00:22:57,312 --> 00:22:57,774
Scott: I don't know.

363
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:59,863
Scott: pandemic legacy is different than pandemic, which is garbage.

364
00:22:59,983 --> 00:23:01,530
Rym: Oh, yeah, you don't need to play regular pandemic.

365
00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:03,215
Scott: I haven't played pandemic legacy.

366
00:23:03,255 --> 00:23:12,905
Rym: So, you know, I've heard some people say that it might have some redeeming qualities over regular pandemic That I want to point out that that is the most positive you have ever sounded about pandemic.

367
00:23:12,966 --> 00:23:14,150
Scott: I cannot confirm or deny.

368
00:23:15,111 --> 00:23:17,519
Rym: No, do not watch mad bull 34.

369
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:19,927
Rym: I think you're better off watching a popular apocalypse zero.

370
00:23:20,008 --> 00:23:29,749
Rym: No Anyway when I'm not doing those three panels I'm either gonna be playing board games in my hotel room or playing board games in the tabletop area.

371
00:23:31,292 --> 00:23:33,202
Rym: And also I'm not gonna be there on Friday because I'm just go to work.

372
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,002
Scott: I Will not be wasting my time going to Lancaster friends.

373
00:23:37,022 --> 00:23:38,470
Rym: I don't know why you're so down on zinc icon.

374
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:39,252
Rym: It's a great.

375
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,476
Rym: It's basically review con.

376
00:23:40,998 --> 00:23:44,630
Rym: Plus I I do some panels and otherwise it's just review con.

377
00:23:45,653 --> 00:23:46,717
Scott: I mean Lancaster Pennsylvania.

378
00:23:47,018 --> 00:23:48,081
Rym: Yeah with amazing food.

379
00:23:48,382 --> 00:23:48,543
Scott: Mm-hmm.

380
00:23:49,005 --> 00:23:50,530
Rym: It's a short train ride on Sunday.

381
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:52,935
Scott: No, they fix that and at night.

382
00:23:53,176 --> 00:23:54,139
Rym: No, there's food now.

383
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,443
Scott: Uh-huh.

384
00:23:55,824 --> 00:23:57,630
Rym: I talked about this when I reviewed the con last year.

385
00:23:57,971 --> 00:23:58,836
Rym: There's plenty of food now.

386
00:23:59,298 --> 00:24:01,549
Rym: all these non-religious restaurants opened up.

387
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:07,492
Rym: Apparently the locals are mad about it and apparently only non locals eat at these places Mm-hmm.

388
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:08,556
Rym: There's all these like.

389
00:24:08,576 --> 00:24:12,250
Rym: there are literally restaurants there that basically people who take the Amtrak from New York.

390
00:24:12,714 --> 00:24:18,650
Rym: No one else does okay Which is sad because when I was on the ski trip this year, we ran into the same thing.

391
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:24,674
Rym: There's this place we eat at which ironically is called the common man And it's got.

392
00:24:25,015 --> 00:24:30,156
Rym: its motif is like I don't know farmer Peasants and it's got like.

393
00:24:30,196 --> 00:24:47,449
Rym: this logo is literally like a peasant pushing some peasant ass thing But the proprietor of this establishment I was talking to him because we were there alone because we were there like in a time when most tourists don't come in to Ski and he was like, yeah, literally no one who lives within a hundred miles of this place will ever eat here.

394
00:24:48,411 --> 00:24:49,734
Rym: Okay, no one can afford to.

395
00:24:49,774 --> 00:24:57,137
Rym: this place exists solely for New Yorkers and mostly New Yorkers who come out here to ski And that's it.

396
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:59,230
Rym: And that's sustainable business model, apparently.

397
00:25:00,111 --> 00:25:02,558
Rym: So Ed Piscor, right?

398
00:25:02,578 --> 00:25:04,464
Scott: So we talked about him on the show before.

399
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,310
Rym: I think there's awesome posters, right?

400
00:25:07,052 --> 00:25:12,410
Scott: No ed Piscor is the creator of a comic known as hip-hop family tree.

401
00:25:13,871 --> 00:25:17,665
Scott: Family tree is a comic which is in.

402
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:18,890
Scott: ed Piscor is unique.

403
00:25:19,412 --> 00:25:21,138
Scott: It's he has a unique style yet.

404
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:27,530
Scott: It is familiar to you feel like you've seen this style before Yet you can't name where you've seen it before.

405
00:25:29,253 --> 00:25:45,467
Scott: But he made a comic called hip-hop family tree, which is the history of the creation of the hip Genre of music in somewhat documentary but also Somewhat definitely document her somewhat not documentary for that is a photograph.

406
00:25:45,688 --> 00:25:46,210
Rym: I'm assuming

407
00:25:48,531 --> 00:26:12,210
Scott: So It was such a mega amazing awesome comic that you should read if you can get your hands on it, which you can just buy it That Marvel the you know, well Disney hired him to make a comic called x-men grand design Which he made joyfully as he is a big-ass x-men nerd a little younger than me, but still a big x-men nerd.

408
00:26:12,331 --> 00:26:15,249
Scott: Yeah, he grew up drawing some x-men as a kid.

409
00:26:16,272 --> 00:26:18,200
Scott: you know, that's how he ended up doing comics.

410
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:29,586
Scott: and this x-men grand design is Thankfully an x-men comic a normal person can read or at least a normal nerd can read Because it is not involved with any current x-men stuff.

411
00:26:29,646 --> 00:26:33,079
Scott: It is basically Same thing as hip-hop family tree.

412
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,270
Scott: almost you could almost call it x-men family tree.

413
00:26:35,871 --> 00:26:46,684
Scott: It is a retelling, you know of the original x-men story in a new Digestible form yet also an old form right.

414
00:26:46,764 --> 00:27:01,290
Scott: and then at the very end of this first volume There's also a bonus which is basically a redrawing of the first issue of x-men just redrawn But otherwise exactly identical to the first issue of x-men just in his style instead of in the original style.

415
00:27:02,811 --> 00:27:04,795
Rym: I'm gonna say that I really enjoyed it first off.

416
00:27:05,556 --> 00:27:07,460
Rym: What uh, it's definitely.

417
00:27:09,471 --> 00:27:20,170
Rym: It captures a lot of what x-men is really like in condensed form Meaning that the statement I just said is either a strong positive or a strong negative depending on who you are.

418
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:23,070
Scott: That's all yeah, it's still x-men, right?

419
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:26,483
Scott: It's not, you know sort of taking the x-men out of x-men.

420
00:27:26,624 --> 00:27:36,270
Rym: It's not read writing anything It's not really changing like plots or back story But what it does do is sort of tie things together.

421
00:27:36,431 --> 00:27:36,612
Scott: Right.

422
00:27:36,672 --> 00:27:40,210
Scott: because if you actually read the original real x-men comics, right?

423
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:46,384
Scott: Let's say you get your hands on every fucking x-men comic ever and you freeze time except for everyone but you so you can read them all.

424
00:27:48,193 --> 00:27:53,615
Scott: You know, there are things that happen and some of those things, you know Sort of come out of nowhere.

425
00:27:53,675 --> 00:27:54,338
Scott: They don't have.

426
00:27:54,358 --> 00:27:59,169
Scott: you know it, you know, it's like you get time travel You get characters coming in.

427
00:27:59,273 --> 00:28:08,810
Scott: Yeah And it's like things happened and changed over time because writers would change new series would come up Crossover events would happen with the rest of the Marvel Universe.

428
00:28:09,592 --> 00:28:18,330
Rym: I would read for a while and then I go to a comic shop and literally just buy like Whatever uncanny x-men was there and it would just be like I wouldn't know what was happening.

429
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:21,990
Scott: Yeah, that'd be retcons and this and that and all you know things would happen.

430
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:40,950
Scott: But like if you were to say see something happen in x-men issue 200 It's like the things that foreshadow that may have been a non-existent or be only go back a few issues Here, for example, you've got like, you know the sentinel thing which came, you know quite a bit later.

431
00:28:41,231 --> 00:28:43,630
Scott: Yeah, no tied in from the beginning, right?

432
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:49,690
Rym: They're showing you back to like Xavier finding storm right Farouk and all that like really old ass nonsense, right?

433
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:59,841
Scott: You've got you know, the Phoenix Force, you know being foreshadowed heavily like oh the feet They're like, hey the Phoenix Force is coming Even though if you actually read the comics is sort of like Phoenix for it's like.

434
00:28:59,861 --> 00:29:00,363
Rym: what's that?

435
00:29:00,563 --> 00:29:00,804
Rym: Yep.

436
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:01,787
Scott: Here it is.

437
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:06,770
Rym: I Remember as a kid when the from the dart in the Phoenix shit happened.

438
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:11,949
Rym: I remember feeling dumb and thinking wait, I should know if shouldn't I know what this is.

439
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,716
Rym: Did I just like not read this?

440
00:29:14,097 --> 00:29:16,548
Rym: and I didn't like I didn't understand what the deal was.

441
00:29:16,568 --> 00:29:25,950
Scott: Yeah I mean actually bought um, I didn't read the actual Phoenix, you know The famous comic where Sokolov is holding the dead dream girl in the cover.

442
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:41,150
Scott: Yeah That comic and the couple issues before after it until I was living in Beacon and I bought basically like Marvel Essentials essential x-men volume something that contained all those issues in black and white and it's really only like a few issues.

443
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:44,500
Scott: It's not like this big mega thing that leads into it.

444
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:52,926
Scott: Right and it's you know, it's like uncanny x-men from like the 80s Like, you know, it's like it comes way deep in.

445
00:29:52,946 --> 00:30:10,950
Scott: Yeah story Whereas here you've got you know in this retelling that's sort of trying to take all the major Plot points of x-men the you know, the big things that happen right get rid of all those meaningless details and you know Month-to-month garbage that doesn't matter, you know the in between the real issues.

446
00:30:11,171 --> 00:30:13,296
Scott: Just take the big major plot points.

447
00:30:13,356 --> 00:30:26,950
Rym: right x-men are created because X their magneto is here and Xavier Yeah, there's magnetos deal if you want to know like Other than oh he was in the Holocaust and then he has reasons, right?

448
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:31,705
Scott: It's like basically he you know, well, how did why did professor X already know storm?

449
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,090
Rym: Like what's Jean Grey's deal?

450
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,134
Rym: Where did you really come from?

451
00:30:34,395 --> 00:30:44,303
Scott: Yeah, all this stuff is You know Told without any cruft and it sort of feels a bit hurried because you're only going over these major details

452
00:30:44,404 --> 00:30:53,294
Rym: and it feels somewhat disjointed because literally read a page and it's like Professor X deals with Farouk over the span of like six panels like that entire story.

453
00:30:53,615 --> 00:30:55,720
Rym: the next page is like what was magneto doing?

454
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,553
Scott: Yep, it's like you might not even realize you're like, oh, it's magneto.

455
00:30:59,573 --> 00:31:01,520
Scott: Yeah, I actually took me a couple panels.

456
00:31:01,621 --> 00:31:07,131
Scott: I'm like, all right, that's what's going on And that only it helped that I had all this x-men knowledge.

457
00:31:07,493 --> 00:31:10,804
Scott: if you don't have x-men knowledge at all I can't.

458
00:31:10,844 --> 00:31:13,075
Scott: I don't know if this will be I can't tell.

459
00:31:13,095 --> 00:31:24,177
Scott: this will either be great for you because it'll allow you to get the big picture of What the egg all the major things that happen to the x-men the important parts of the story without the garbage.

460
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:24,960
Scott: that's hard to understand.

461
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:30,660
Scott: Honestly, I didn't know or you might not know what the hell is going on because you've never read any x-men before.

462
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,769
Scott: Like who the hell are these people?

463
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:35,808
Scott: there's no character development No character advanced for the x-men that I had read.

464
00:31:35,828 --> 00:31:38,096
Rym: I never knew who the fuck Namor was.

465
00:31:38,116 --> 00:31:40,854
Scott: Oh, you know Namor I never read those parts.

466
00:31:40,874 --> 00:31:41,440
Rym: I had no idea.

467
00:31:41,601 --> 00:31:41,922
Scott: that's that.

468
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:49,506
Scott: well see the thing is that's actually a very interesting part of this x-men grand design because Namor the Submariner was.

469
00:31:49,586 --> 00:31:50,489
Scott: you know, he is a mutant.

470
00:31:50,649 --> 00:32:03,876
Scott: Yeah, but that part of you know Establishing why humanity hates mutants it being Namor's fault of sort of making the wrong first impression Was not really in x-men comics.

471
00:32:03,937 --> 00:32:06,284
Scott: That was a Motherfucking comic.

472
00:32:06,364 --> 00:32:07,528
Scott: Namor is way.

473
00:32:07,668 --> 00:32:11,240
Scott: Namor is like one of the original Marvel things from like decades before the x-men.

474
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,810
Scott: He predates the x-men by like a zillion years.

475
00:32:14,152 --> 00:32:15,216
Scott: the fact that he's a mutant.

476
00:32:15,336 --> 00:32:18,065
Scott: I'm pretty sure Came way later.

477
00:32:18,266 --> 00:32:22,160
Scott: This is originally just like the prince or king of Atlantis who is evil.

478
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:30,080
Scott: This is actually the thing that caused more not really evil but sort of you know Seen as evil by humans, right?

479
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:40,643
Rym: So when I was younger like middle school elementary school every time I started reading x-men the other kids who read more comics than me would always Like like.

480
00:32:40,684 --> 00:32:43,492
Rym: I wouldn't know about shit like Namor and they all knew.

481
00:32:43,512 --> 00:32:51,076
Rym: and I and it wasn't until much later in my life That I realized there were all like you had to read non x-men comics to understand.

482
00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:52,100
Scott: see I going on.

483
00:32:52,321 --> 00:32:54,332
Rym: I just assumed that they knew and I didn't understand.

484
00:32:54,412 --> 00:32:55,257
Scott: why see I cheat?

485
00:32:55,277 --> 00:32:58,256
Scott: when I was a kid There were only three kinds of comics that I read.

486
00:32:58,316 --> 00:33:07,975
Scott: I read Spider-man, but I read spider-man 2099 because it started at issue one and in 1990 Whatever two three and it was cyberpunk.

487
00:33:08,256 --> 00:33:10,326
Scott: So it was the best I read like still the best.

488
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:13,140
Scott: if you want to read I highly recommend spider-man 2099.

489
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,710
Rym: I also I read x-force and like later uncanny x-men.

490
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:20,520
Scott: I also read all that infinity stuff, which is becoming very relevant.

491
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,008
Scott: It's good to have that knowledge today.

492
00:33:22,029 --> 00:33:25,683
Scott: Yeah, even though I'm not watching that movie And three.

493
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:28,555
Rym: so the best part about that movie is of course like a ton of characters die.

494
00:33:28,977 --> 00:33:29,760
Rym: from what I gather.

495
00:33:29,961 --> 00:33:32,656
Scott: Well in the comic half the superheroes died, but then they undyed.

496
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:33,300
Rym: so from what?

497
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,078
Rym: Yeah, this is something like I was curious about this.

498
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:52,280
Rym: it appears that the majority of the people who went to see this movie have mostly just been watching MCU and I Realized if you've never actually read comics and just watch the movies the idea that superheroes die all the time And like that's just a thing is unknown

499
00:33:53,211 --> 00:33:53,580
Scott: All right.

500
00:33:53,761 --> 00:34:02,695
Rym: So teenagers who have watched every Marvel Cinematic Universe thing and read zero comics are Freaking the fuck out because all their favorite characters are dead.

501
00:34:02,735 --> 00:34:04,020
Scott: They'll be back in the next movie.

502
00:34:05,464 --> 00:34:06,918
Scott: They'll have different actors coming back.

503
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,908
Scott: Those are mostly just to kill off the contracts.

504
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:16,368
Rym: Yeah, but they literally don't know that like Superman died a hundred times He died the first time he died.

505
00:34:16,408 --> 00:34:17,110
Scott: It was a big deal.

506
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:21,239
Rym: Oh, yeah the first time a super big superhero died It was a big deal and then we learned and knew better.

507
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:24,980
Scott: But yeah, well anyway Was I saying?

508
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:34,339
Scott: Right, and I read the Infinity comics and I read x-men comics right now and the way I knew about other things in Marvel anyway.

509
00:34:35,023 --> 00:34:37,536
Scott: Well, I was like collected superhero cards.

510
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:42,607
Scott: I cards to but Characters were without having to.

511
00:34:42,788 --> 00:34:45,857
Scott: I didn't read any Namor moon Knight or fantastic or con.

512
00:34:45,897 --> 00:34:46,960
Scott: I mean I've read them later.

513
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:54,440
Scott: But as a kid, I didn't read any of those other comics never read an Avengers comic I never read any of that garbage, but I knew who Iron Man was a new Captain America was.

514
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,660
Scott: I knew what their origins were what their deals were and all this stuff.

515
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,774
Scott: because I read those superhero cards that I collected I collect.

516
00:35:01,794 --> 00:35:07,172
Scott: there was then when they were Like single panel references to these other characters and things.

517
00:35:07,754 --> 00:35:18,019
Scott: and also there was for example one time There was a series right after there was fatal attractions Which is the the crossover between all the different X series which let me learn all the X for.

518
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:19,505
Rym: yeah I read fatal attractions.

519
00:35:19,606 --> 00:35:22,420
Scott: There was that's the one where Wolverine got all the metal ripped out of him.

520
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:31,560
Scott: Yeah, right after that cuz then he had the bone right right after that the next there was immediately a second crossover Which is the x-men Avengers like blood ties cross.

521
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,407
Rym: Oh, that is when I stopped reading.

522
00:35:33,587 --> 00:35:37,140
Scott: but I read that and that's how I knew who some Avengers were at that point.

523
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,164
Scott: Right and things like that.

524
00:35:38,224 --> 00:35:39,348
Rym: I never read any Avengers.

525
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:44,854
Scott: I mean I that's the only Avengers I read was yeah Not even that I just didn't care.

526
00:35:44,874 --> 00:35:49,136
Scott: later on I guess I read Kree's girl war which is include some event.

527
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:50,000
Rym: part of what messed it up.

528
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,466
Rym: Is that because I got into anime so young?

529
00:35:52,487 --> 00:35:57,500
Rym: I was like trying to read x-men after I'd already discovered anime.

530
00:35:58,203 --> 00:36:04,796
Rym: So as soon as I found as soon as manga was purchasable by me I basically stopped reading American comics for like a decade.

531
00:36:04,816 --> 00:36:10,680
Scott: I Stopped reading the comics when they comic book store went away, and then it got anime.

532
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,753
Rym: Yep, but like I read one manga, and I was like whoa.

533
00:36:14,396 --> 00:36:18,197
Scott: This is a comic Mm-hmm anyway, but yeah if you.

534
00:36:19,123 --> 00:36:21,780
Scott: So this x-men grand design by the way is like a large.

535
00:36:22,061 --> 00:36:24,391
Scott: It's not a. you're gonna get the trade paperback.

536
00:36:24,552 --> 00:36:25,295
Rym: Don't get the trade.

537
00:36:25,335 --> 00:36:26,360
Rym: get this giant ass book.

538
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:26,862
Scott: That's it well.

539
00:36:26,902 --> 00:36:28,529
Scott: No then this is the trade paperback.

540
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:30,477
Scott: There's a hardcover is the other one?

541
00:36:30,517 --> 00:36:31,300
Rym: don't get the hardcover.

542
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:34,932
Scott: So this is a. this is like it's like a Marvel Treasury Edition.

543
00:36:34,972 --> 00:36:37,600
Scott: It's not a normal size trade paperback.

544
00:36:37,781 --> 00:36:45,906
Scott: It's like this big fucking thing and the pages are like not quite newspaper size But they but they feel very newsprint.

545
00:36:46,006 --> 00:36:48,173
Scott: It's bigger than an old-life magazine.

546
00:36:48,233 --> 00:36:50,740
Rym: I'd say oh easily bigger than life magazine.

547
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:50,921
Rym: It's.

548
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:52,044
Scott: the point is is big.

549
00:36:52,205 --> 00:36:53,910
Scott: It's not a normal size book.

550
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:56,098
Rym: I can't actually like get it all in frame here.

551
00:36:56,118 --> 00:37:03,140
Scott: Yeah It's at least it's probably like it's like a legal pad, but whiter almost.

552
00:37:04,701 --> 00:37:05,163
Rym: I had trouble.

553
00:37:05,203 --> 00:37:09,380
Rym: I was reading it in bed, and I wanted to set it down, and it wouldn't fit on the tiny table.

554
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:12,147
Scott: It's not thick or heavy.

555
00:37:12,247 --> 00:37:12,870
Scott: It's just big.

556
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:16,085
Scott: it's gonna take up like it's like laptop size Maybe even like 15.

557
00:37:16,085 --> 00:37:18,074
Rym: this is way bigger than my laptop.

558
00:37:18,214 --> 00:37:19,400
Scott: It's bigger than my laptop, too.

559
00:37:20,701 --> 00:37:21,944
Scott: It's bigger than my big iPad.

560
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:26,818
Scott: so it needs to be that big because the art blows up to that big.

561
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:33,700
Scott: really well I'm gonna say even though like it includes a lot of the corniness If they come out with a smaller edition you don't want the smaller edition.

562
00:37:34,242 --> 00:37:37,777
Scott: But just got to know it's a big book if you buy it on Amazon, but

563
00:37:37,877 --> 00:37:49,080
Rym: most of the joy I got from reading it is just that it was a condensed Feeling of what it was like when I was reading comics as a kid, but condensed to my adult.

564
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:55,887
Rym: Let's move it along sensibilities, and I really enjoyed just Looking at all this art.

565
00:37:55,968 --> 00:37:58,860
Rym: I really like like this style of comic art.

566
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:03,140
Rym: You know One of these pages would be a great poster.

567
00:38:03,401 --> 00:38:15,760
Scott: There's another so you get Charles Xavier with dot eyes and dot eyes is one of my favorite things googly eyes, but There is another x-men series from that was not super recent, but somewhat recent.

568
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,562
Scott: I think it's.

569
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:21,999
Scott: I don't know if it's x-men forever it might be called and what that is is it's basically.

570
00:38:22,019 --> 00:38:36,600
Scott: you know There's the wheat this uncanny accent, but then this adjective list x-men We read where the first issue with Jim yeah, yeah with the full all the multiple fold-out covers Yeah So that adjective was x-men sort of got away from where it started at a certain point.

571
00:38:37,101 --> 00:38:42,180
Scott: And is that more recent series is basically ignoring all other x-men continuity.

572
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:56,158
Scott: it basically just picks a spot in that series where it's veers off and cancels everything that veers off and just starts at that veering off point and Keeps going as if it had been had the same writer the whole time now.

573
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,879
Scott: This is one thing I like about the MCU and it has only these 90s character designs with it.

574
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:09,591
Rym: I'm hoping the MCU will keep its continuity and never Split off again like they're releasing the movies and slow enough right?

575
00:39:09,651 --> 00:39:13,140
Scott: or the people who are the realities of actors and money-making.

576
00:39:13,322 --> 00:39:15,217
Rym: That will never happen yeah, but we'll see how it goes cuz.

577
00:39:15,237 --> 00:39:20,038
Rym: right now It's coming at a sustainable rate because instead of read this whole series then this whole series.

578
00:39:20,098 --> 00:39:22,184
Rym: It's literally There's 19 movies.

579
00:39:22,204 --> 00:39:23,910
Rym: Just watch a movie and then watch a movie.

580
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:25,114
Scott: Yeah, it's 19 movies.

581
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:25,757
Scott: wait until there's 190 movies.

582
00:39:27,002 --> 00:39:28,149
Rym: Yeah, but I mean I've watched.

583
00:39:28,229 --> 00:39:29,860
Rym: I've watched all of Sailor Moon in a weekend.

584
00:39:30,221 --> 00:39:31,528
Rym: That's 200 episodes.

585
00:39:31,729 --> 00:39:33,879
Scott: you're gonna watch all the superhero movies in a weekend.

586
00:39:34,901 --> 00:39:35,464
Scott: Their movies.

587
00:39:35,504 --> 00:39:36,990
Scott: it must be 90 minutes right these things.

588
00:39:38,182 --> 00:39:39,610
Rym: I mean I've seen a few of them.

589
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,299
Scott: there are at least 90 minutes each right?

590
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:50,838
Rym: yeah the trouble is the ones I enjoyed the most were Guardians of the Galaxy one and I Haven't seen Thor Ragnarok yet, so I don't have any opinions on it.

591
00:39:51,786 --> 00:39:56,229
Rym: Yeah Guardians of the Galaxy Doctor Strange was okay, but I don't need to watch it again.

592
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,173
Scott: the main problem.

593
00:39:57,233 --> 00:40:03,464
Scott: Is that they don't have the Aesthetic enough.

594
00:40:03,705 --> 00:40:07,039
Scott: the comics you know Marvel Comics that I like have that.

595
00:40:08,965 --> 00:40:13,158
Rym: Well even in this one in Grand Design in the very beginning you get the watcher and his recorder.

596
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:15,407
Scott: yeah Yeah, that's actually really.

597
00:40:15,568 --> 00:40:19,805
Scott: you know cuz that the watcher doesn't show up in x-men comics very Right.

598
00:40:19,826 --> 00:40:30,210
Rym: so the fact that they bring him in there Really sort of sets the tone of like what this just I love the fact that he's standing there with his hand on his chin Just like I have watch now.

599
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:32,158
Rym: I'm going to record on a tape.

600
00:40:32,198 --> 00:40:43,640
Scott: well the reason He's watching right is not just to sort of you know provide a non corny intro at the start Which is often the watchers use in Marvel Comics is to provide this sort of narration.

601
00:40:43,801 --> 00:40:45,837
Scott: Yeah, but you see what's going on here.

602
00:40:45,858 --> 00:40:58,000
Scott: well But it is here it actually serves a second purpose and that it shows it says is the story of the x-men Which is usually a very local story a very American story an earth story, right?

603
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:07,420
Scott: It only goes into space when you're dealing with Cyclops is dead Which actually they totally bring into the fold here properly right and you know instead of having it come out of nowhere the starjammers.

604
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:24,260
Scott: But he you know combined with the Phoenix force it shows how the x-men it sort of takes the x-men story and shows How it is a grand you know design a universal design of some sort and not just this local story, right?

605
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,427
Rym: Yeah, if it does this does do a very good job.

606
00:41:26,467 --> 00:41:33,471
Rym: It is comic of fitting the x-men shit into this like giant Apocalyptic future space world right.

607
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:37,674
Scott: it's sort of you know whereas before again It was just sort of like you know a Marvel comic.

608
00:41:37,714 --> 00:41:39,866
Scott: if you read it over time It's just sort of bouncing around.

609
00:41:39,906 --> 00:41:40,268
Scott: It's like well.

610
00:41:40,288 --> 00:41:42,840
Scott: What do we do the x-men now into space with you, right?

611
00:41:43,343 --> 00:41:44,619
Scott: Yeah, where you know here?

612
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:49,060
Scott: It's like you know by having that watcher there all this stuff for the Shi'ar come.

613
00:41:49,181 --> 00:41:53,258
Scott: I guess professor X didn't date the Shi'ar Queen yet, but yeah that comes later.

614
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,959
Scott: spoilers And the Phoenix.

615
00:41:58,743 --> 00:42:03,540
Scott: Find out what Magneto's up to right, but you know they sort of you know it helps tie.

616
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:09,020
Scott: He's tying all those random x-men bits together into a grand design.

617
00:42:10,222 --> 00:42:11,196
Scott: Right which is what makes it?

618
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:13,246
