1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,623
Rym: It's Monday April 30th 2018.

2
00:00:11,623 --> 00:00:12,064
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,405 --> 00:00:14,712
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,174 --> 00:00:17,300
Rym: What's next for smartphones?

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:34,392
Rym: Let's do this so as you all know I Very much don't like large cell phones like if I could get a phone that was the size of my old palm free But had the capabilities of a modern smartphone.

6
00:00:34,694 --> 00:00:36,060
Rym: I'd be very much for it.

7
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,832
Scott: It just doesn't make any sense right is?

8
00:00:37,873 --> 00:00:43,300
Scott: in the earliest days They came with the iPod and then they're like smaller smaller smaller.

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,752
Scott: Let's make this as small as we can.

10
00:00:44,772 --> 00:00:49,951
Scott: and then we got that iPad And everyone was and everyone was like common sense.

11
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:50,292
Scott: Yes.

12
00:00:50,412 --> 00:00:55,860
Scott: I would like to carry around more things in less space iPod Nano iPod shuffle, let's go as small as we can go.

13
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,569
Scott: We don't want to carry around a big heavy fucking thing.

14
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:08,100
Scott: and then the iPhone came out and then they're like iPhone 3g Smaller iPhone 4 smaller iPhone 5 smaller and all these other companies were like we make them bigger.

15
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,285
Scott: And why did they make them bigger?

16
00:01:09,305 --> 00:01:12,520
Scott: It wasn't because bigger is actually better.

17
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,574
Scott: It's because they did not have the miniaturization.

18
00:01:15,614 --> 00:01:16,820
Scott: It's hard to make something small.

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,273
Scott: Yeah They did not have the advanced hardware miniaturization technology that Apple had.

20
00:01:21,293 --> 00:01:27,934
Scott: so but they did have was marketing Technology and they just convinced people that bigger they like bigger screen guys.

21
00:01:27,994 --> 00:01:30,100
Scott: Yeah, we can't make our battery any smaller.

22
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:33,860
Scott: So, uh-huh, but we're not gonna tell you that just you know bigger is better.

23
00:01:34,281 --> 00:01:37,592
Scott: So people believe bigger is better because they're stupid American.

24
00:01:37,692 --> 00:01:50,099
Rym: but I have also found that in general most of the Preference I see for large phones stems from a combination of untreated vision problems People who don't have a computer.

25
00:01:51,302 --> 00:01:55,535
Rym: Their smartphone is the only computing device they own and they literally use it for everything.

26
00:01:55,555 --> 00:02:02,835
Scott: Uh Those are primarily the two People who say they have big hands, but actually don't.

27
00:02:02,895 --> 00:02:05,274
Scott: if you actually measure their hand Yeah, I think they have a big.

28
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:14,967
Rym: well, never mind There's that UX study that showed across the board phones above a certain size, which that size by the way is Not much bigger than my tiny phone right now.

29
00:02:14,987 --> 00:02:21,674
Rym: our objectively slower for even expert users to interact with Because the thumb can't get all the way across.

30
00:02:22,036 --> 00:02:29,680
Rym: Yep So, uh, I guess the other reason I've seen is a lot of the people we know our friends who were like Oh, I like a big phone and these are people who should know better.

31
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:36,320
Scott: I mean, obviously there's some personal preference like I guess if you're not carrying your phone if you're using it as a tablet.

32
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,675
Scott: If you're just putting it in a car, it doesn't go in.

33
00:02:38,856 --> 00:02:39,359
Rym: Ah, but that's it.

34
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,465
Scott: I'll go in a pocket.

35
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:41,511
Rym: almost everyone.

36
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:49,280
Rym: I know who has a giant ass phone Does is not walking long distances mobile every single day?

37
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:54,170
Scott: Like we let their phone in a bag instead of in their pocket Like we all get.

38
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:58,073
Scott: so at work We had a really don't carry their phone with them at all possible times.

39
00:02:58,114 --> 00:02:59,620
Scott: Like it is an appendage of their body.

40
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,685
Scott: I know where's your phone?

41
00:03:00,825 --> 00:03:01,508
Scott: Oh somewhere else.

42
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:05,305
Scott: It's like maybe if it wasn't a big fucking ass thing You would have all the time.

43
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:06,671
Scott: Yeah, like you should.

44
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:17,780
Rym: so anyway, I the problem with this is that I want a small phone and We hit this point where most Android phones got really really big like starting with the Nexus 5 and onward.

45
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,696
Rym: They're just gigantic, but you've heard me say this before I did find the perfect phone.

46
00:03:21,737 --> 00:03:29,940
Rym: a few years ago I got these Sony Xperia Z 5 compact because I don't enjoy the Apple experience and I'm already too deep into the Android ecosystem.

47
00:03:30,653 --> 00:03:45,617
Rym: so iPhone is is an option that I continue to exclude and A lot of my friends have iPhones except for Scott seemed to periodically run into weird complaints that I do not have Random stuff like the other day.

48
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:47,264
Rym: I so in Android.

49
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:52,540
Rym: my Android Google keyboard has a really easy way to automatically insert gifs into anything.

50
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:55,292
Scott: Yeah, I have g-board for it's an app you get in the App Store.

51
00:03:55,332 --> 00:03:56,337
Scott: It gives you the Google keyboard.

52
00:03:56,357 --> 00:04:03,500
Rym: Yeah, so Multiple people we know who have iPhones don't know they can install the Google keyboard things like that because they're stupid.

53
00:04:04,322 --> 00:04:05,068
Rym: Well, they don't know better.

54
00:04:05,249 --> 00:04:06,820
Scott: I just it's an app called G board.

55
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,097
Scott: I use the Google keyboard the only time it doesn't show.

56
00:04:09,138 --> 00:04:13,516
Scott: in fact The iPhone is so smart that the G board actually communicates with Google.

57
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:14,440
Scott: right networking wise.

58
00:04:15,062 --> 00:04:27,440
Scott: So Apple does not allow custom keyboards to appear whenever you're in a password prompt Forces it to be the local only no network communication Apple iPhone and then it switches back to the Google keyboard for any other inputs.

59
00:04:27,721 --> 00:04:28,705
Scott: So that way nobody.

60
00:04:28,845 --> 00:04:37,839
Scott: if you were to say install an evil custom keyboard app It couldn't spy on you because in the OS it will not allow a custom keyboard on a password prompt.

61
00:04:38,743 --> 00:04:39,587
Scott: So it's so smart.

62
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:47,053
Rym: The z5 compact was pretty much the best Physically like put together Android phone for a long time now.

63
00:04:47,093 --> 00:04:49,260
Rym: the problem with it is that it's a Sony.

64
00:04:49,684 --> 00:04:51,280
Rym: So it's boutique and it was a little expensive.

65
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:56,195
Rym: But the benefit was it was straight-up waterproof, which I tested.

66
00:04:56,216 --> 00:04:58,827
Scott: I used it in water Just dunked it in a bucket.

67
00:04:59,169 --> 00:04:59,531
Rym: I like.

68
00:04:59,752 --> 00:05:01,300
Rym: I brought it with me in the shower.

69
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,349
Scott: I brought it up dump it in a bucket of water.

70
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,418
Scott: It's a fully submerged and see what happens.

71
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:09,240
Rym: I Swam with it in a pool and took pictures underwater.

72
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,332
Scott: All right, can I can I take it and dump it in a bucket after the show?

73
00:05:12,935 --> 00:05:13,497
Rym: my old phone?

74
00:05:13,557 --> 00:05:14,220
Rym: Yeah, it's fine.

75
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,992
Rym: I'll put it in a glass of water right now.

76
00:05:16,012 --> 00:05:16,676
Rym: It's totally fine.

77
00:05:16,837 --> 00:05:20,750
Rym: All right The battery also lasted like two full days.

78
00:05:20,811 --> 00:05:23,520
Scott: post a photo of it playing like a YouTube video while it's in the cup of water.

79
00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:25,747
Rym: I mean, this isn't that unknown.

80
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:27,011
Rym: There was a waterproof phone.

81
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:27,493
Scott: We'll see.

82
00:05:27,513 --> 00:05:28,476
Rym: What do you mean?

83
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:29,419
Rym: We'll see we'll see.

84
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,320
Scott: Okay Anyway, so wait you said your old phone?

85
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,879
Scott: Well, you're not gonna put your new phone in a cup of water.

86
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:46,330
Rym: So my new so that old phone was the most waterproofist phone that anyone's really ever made and most of them have walked in back walked it back to Water-resistant, I think IP 68.

87
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,480
Rym: This is to IP whatever ratings that they've got.

88
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:54,409
Rym: So my new phone should survive submersion But it's not recommended to submerge.

89
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:56,977
Rym: as opposed to the previous phone, which they were like fucking.

90
00:05:56,997 --> 00:05:58,060
Rym: take pictures with it underwater.

91
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:58,822
Rym: It's fine.

92
00:05:58,903 --> 00:06:00,026
Rym: It is water proof.

93
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:00,708
Scott: Mm-hmm.

94
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,780
Rym: And while they got sued over that I looked into the details.

95
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:06,912
Rym: It was only not waterproof.

96
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:16,158
Rym: if you have futzed with it Or if you like open this little door on the side of it that was sealed that held the SIM card Which would not open unless you really picked at it.

97
00:06:17,263 --> 00:06:23,210
Scott: Anyway, this phone sometimes they're like waterproof But like then if you push a button Pressing the button sort of breaks the seals.

98
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:25,320
Rym: the pebble had that problem for a second.

99
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,360
Rym: The pebble was waterproof unless you pushed a button and then it was no longer waterproof.

100
00:06:29,793 --> 00:06:35,340
Rym: Yeah But this phone was brilliant and the problem was it's put it's well over two years old.

101
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:43,487
Rym: The battery started running out and unlike the iPhones which were just throttling your speed So the battery would still last all day without telling you.

102
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:45,093
Rym: This is an Android phone.

103
00:06:45,474 --> 00:06:47,380
Rym: So the battery just ran out faster and faster.

104
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:53,312
Scott: Which one of these things is preferable, but I can configure it.

105
00:06:53,633 --> 00:06:55,037
Rym: I could tell it to throttle itself.

106
00:06:55,118 --> 00:06:55,880
Rym: It was configurable.

107
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,824
Rym: That's the difference.

108
00:06:56,844 --> 00:06:57,727
Rym: the Android ecosystem.

109
00:06:57,767 --> 00:06:58,390
Rym: people complain.

110
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,057
Scott: They added a switch for that in the iPhone.

111
00:07:00,097 --> 00:07:00,900
Scott: I did not touch it.

112
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:01,879
Scott: I left it the way it was.

113
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,555
Rym: Yeah, but the phone's starting to wear out because it's two and a half years old and I can go to the Apple Store Just get a new battery.

114
00:07:08,664 --> 00:07:11,344
Rym: Well, yeah dollars Zero dollars.

115
00:07:11,424 --> 00:07:12,689
Rym: how long after you bought the phone?

116
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:14,275
Rym: or do you have Apple care full-on or whatever?

117
00:07:14,295 --> 00:07:14,917
Rym: I get Apple care.

118
00:07:14,937 --> 00:07:17,087
Rym: Yeah What do you pay for that?

119
00:07:17,128 --> 00:07:18,032
Rym: It's not zero dollars.

120
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:19,560
Rym: That's that Apple care cost.

121
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:21,919
Scott: It's included because I got the iPhone upgrade program.

122
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:24,819
Rym: Oh, yeah But how much does that cost compared to just buying an iPhone?

123
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,046
Rym: Zero extra zero extra.

124
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:30,760
Scott: if you were to buy the iPhone outright and then buy Apple care that would cost you extra money.

125
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,800
Scott: If you get the upgrade plan, you're basically financing the phone at zero percent interest over two years.

126
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:43,916
Scott: Yeah, and then you get free Apple care and you're only paying the price of the phone just on monthly install But you lose the resale value of the previous phone.

127
00:07:43,976 --> 00:07:47,769
Scott: I assume so Don't think I've ever sold a previous phone.

128
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:50,962
Rym: Well, normal people do they usually just if they don't break their phone They sell it.

129
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:52,368
Scott: I don't do that.

130
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,793
Scott: I just give it to someone I know.

131
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:54,396
Rym: Yeah.

132
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:55,480
Rym: Well, that's cuz we got money.

133
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:57,688
Scott: So also the thing is the resale.

134
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:02,728
Scott: if you use the upgrade plan and you actually I was gonna do the upgrade but then They didn't release a better enough iPhone.

135
00:08:02,808 --> 00:08:05,820
Scott: Yeah, so that's the only problem with the upgrade plan.

136
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:12,480
Scott: But the you turn in the old phone which begets automatically fully repaired by Apple care before you turn it in.

137
00:08:12,802 --> 00:08:14,861
Scott: So it gets you go and you go use the Apple care You're like.

138
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:18,680
Scott: can I have a brand new screen in a band your battery please to make sure the resale value of my phone is?

139
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,067
Scott: Perfect.

140
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:19,900
Scott: Thank you All right.

141
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:24,275
Scott: Now I'm giving you the phone back and you're using the value of that phone towards the app.

142
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:25,700
Scott: the next iPhone that I'm upgrading.

143
00:08:26,142 --> 00:08:30,580
Scott: So the next iPhone you upgrade to now cost you less because you turned in the old one to Apple.

144
00:08:30,841 --> 00:08:36,869
Rym: So I did my research to see if in the third two and a half years since I last bought a phone Anything had changed.

145
00:08:37,111 --> 00:08:37,816
Rym: the answer was no.

146
00:08:39,062 --> 00:08:45,360
Rym: Only Sony makes small Android phones that are good and only Sony has good hardware design for small phones.

147
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:52,286
Rym: so the Xperia XZ2 Compact is the newest one that came out.

148
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:58,200
Rym: It just came out and it's an ugly looking piece of shit and it's big.

149
00:08:59,143 --> 00:09:08,437
Rym: The compact is a more than a centimeter taller than the previous Compact and taller is the problem because taller means it will fit in my tiny pocket.

150
00:09:08,618 --> 00:09:09,180
Scott: Is it waterproof?

151
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,144
Scott: Can you put it in the ocean?

152
00:09:10,325 --> 00:09:12,034
Rym: No phones are waterproof anymore.

153
00:09:12,195 --> 00:09:17,919
Rym: Okay, it's water resistant Like it would survive dunking in water the ocean, uh, probably for a short amount of time.

154
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:25,540
Rym: But and I don't want to get into the details of what those different IP whatever certifications Can I put it inside a walrus and take it out?

155
00:09:29,242 --> 00:09:29,796
Rym: Why walrus?

156
00:09:30,843 --> 00:09:32,749
Scott: I was thinking hippo, but I said the wrong thing.

157
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:42,900
Rym: Anyway, the XZ2 compact is big ugly Not materially better than the previous year's iteration the XZ1 compact.

158
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:45,505
Rym: Also, it's way expensive.

159
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:56,040
Rym: the previous year's XZ1 compact is in my estimation as of today April 30th 2018 the best Android phone hardware on the market.

160
00:09:56,664 --> 00:10:01,447
Rym: it is just markedly better in every way than the Z5 compact that I had before.

161
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:02,553
Rym: it's super fast.

162
00:10:02,593 --> 00:10:04,040
Rym: It's got the newest version of Android.

163
00:10:04,242 --> 00:10:06,359
Scott: Is that just because it has a battery that's not dying?

164
00:10:06,642 --> 00:10:07,271
Rym: It's not just that.

165
00:10:07,312 --> 00:10:07,860
Rym: it is faster.

166
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:13,000
Scott: It has a much faster process if you just buy two for insurance and then use the second one when the first one dies.

167
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:21,440
Rym: So what I did instead is this is the first time in my life I bought a new phone while my old one was still technically usable.

168
00:10:22,063 --> 00:10:32,660
Rym: It's not like every other time where the old one stopped working And I have to buy something Like when you broke your computer and then you can upgrade your computer so you can render faster.

169
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:38,220
Rym: Yes, so this time the USB ports a little jank, but otherwise the phone works fine.

170
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,586
Rym: It's just slow because the battery is shitty.

171
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:43,060
Rym: So I just bought the new phone because I did my research.

172
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:44,280
Rym: It's about the cycle time.

173
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:50,467
Rym: it's the best one and all I have to say about this phone having used it is that I have Zero complaints.

174
00:10:50,527 --> 00:10:51,492
Rym: This phone is amazing.

175
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:54,618
Rym: if you want an Android phone That's the problem with it.

176
00:10:55,342 --> 00:11:03,560
Rym: This is the one and it's only like 400 bucks because it's last year's model and the newer model is like 700 bucks and worse.

177
00:11:04,543 --> 00:11:05,348
Scott: See what I'm hoping for.

178
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:12,475
Rym: Also this phone appears to have One of the best if not the best camera of any Android phone.

179
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:14,200
Rym: It's a crazy good camera.

180
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:24,620
Scott: What's likely to happen this year is that you're gonna get first of all, they're gonna upgrade Supposedly within like a month or two, maybe the the iPhone SE, you know, the one that still looks like an iPhone 5.

181
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,953
Scott: Yeah, so then that will be a very good choice for a tiny phone and I might go that route.

182
00:11:29,334 --> 00:11:30,698
Scott: but also they may.

183
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:35,526
Scott: They're supposedly, you know iPhone 9 or whatever It's gonna be is gonna.

184
00:11:35,627 --> 00:11:38,660
Scott: basically they realize no one bought an iPhone X for a fucking thousand dollars.

185
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:43,908
Scott: Yeah, they're gonna take the iPhone X technology The only part of which that anyone really wants.

186
00:11:43,948 --> 00:11:47,840
Scott: no one cares about fucking like face recognition garbage, right or whatever that is.

187
00:11:48,181 --> 00:11:53,840
Scott: But the only technology in the iPhone X that I want is the fancy OLED screen of oh, it's as fancy as screen.

188
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:57,808
Scott: Oh, yeah The best LEDs the best screen on any phone there is.

189
00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:03,245
Scott: and supposedly you take that screen and you put it on a cheaper phone And then I go.

190
00:12:03,486 --> 00:12:05,354
Scott: Oh, that is the best screen on a phone.

191
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:05,776
Scott: I buy that.

192
00:12:05,796 --> 00:12:08,279
Scott: Yeah But yeah, I'm real pleased with this.

193
00:12:09,684 --> 00:12:23,120
Rym: so if you need an Android phone in the in the immediate future, I Think this is literally the only one worth buying even despite its Sony because it's not stock Android.

194
00:12:23,421 --> 00:12:31,112
Rym: You can really only get good stock Android if you read your phone or you buy like a Google device But all like a Nexus whatever is whatever those turned into.

195
00:12:31,132 --> 00:12:34,545
Rym: but all those phones are gigantic monsters so it's not worth it.

196
00:12:35,268 --> 00:12:41,268
Rym: and the Sony like branded Android is 99% of Android like none of the Sony.

197
00:12:41,288 --> 00:12:42,071
Rym: shit gets in my way.

198
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:48,217
Rym: you can disable the few things that actually does And it's pretty much as normal Android and it gets updates constantly.

199
00:12:48,237 --> 00:12:52,460
Scott: Hmm So just because it's Tech Monday, I can make this aside about technology.

200
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,924
Scott: So OLEDs if people don't know.

201
00:12:53,944 --> 00:13:01,613
Scott: so in normal screens for any kind of screen whether it's a phone or a TV or whatever Right most screens these days are LED screens.

202
00:13:01,673 --> 00:13:19,179
Scott: This is a sheet of You know Like, you know LCD liquid crystals that change colors Yeah, and then in order to see the image that's being generated on the screen basically, there's a light bulb behind there that shines through and Basically that light bulb is if the TV is on or the phone is on the light bulb is on.

203
00:13:19,621 --> 00:13:22,714
Scott: And the better screens these days don't use light bulbs.

204
00:13:22,754 --> 00:13:24,180
Scott: They use LEDs to light them up.

205
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,004
Scott: That's what someone means.

206
00:13:25,064 --> 00:13:28,420
Rym: They say an LED TV, but it's really these that are on all the time.

207
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,069
Scott: It's still just an LCD screen.

208
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:33,500
Scott: It's the same screen as a right as an old screen.

209
00:13:33,983 --> 00:13:37,140
Scott: It's just has LEDs a different light bulb a better light bulb, right?

210
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,023
Scott: So it's a better image.

211
00:13:38,424 --> 00:13:41,435
Scott: an OLED screen is an organic LED, right?

212
00:13:41,455 --> 00:13:50,098
Scott: So basically what those do is In the screen itself in the LCD part the pixels each have their own light.

213
00:13:50,138 --> 00:14:06,740
Scott: they light up Individually, which means that the pixels that are dark are dark, you know When you look at a TV and you see the even in the black area It's sort of gray because you got this light shining through Right, and that's what makes the image and the contrast ratio kind of crappy and hazy and not as awesome as a movie theater.

214
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:14,064
Scott: Right, but an OLED screen is like only the pixels that are lit up are lit up and the other ones are pitch fucking Black and it looks incredible.

215
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:18,420
Scott: It's the best image like screen you can get since like plasma screens ain't cheap.

216
00:14:18,982 --> 00:14:24,440
Scott: They ain't cheap because the factories that make them have very very low yields.

217
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:35,855
Scott: like they try to make an OLED screen in the factory and like the vast majority of them like More than I say 75% of them when they come off the fad into the factory line there.

218
00:14:36,016 --> 00:14:37,420
Scott: They got there busted like they're no good.

219
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,631
Scott: It's like oh, this one's no good.

220
00:14:38,793 --> 00:14:39,459
Scott: This one's no good.

221
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:41,711
Rym: Typical of a new technology of any kind.

222
00:14:41,771 --> 00:14:43,140
Rym: once you hit mass manufacturing, right?

223
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:49,880
Scott: So you can actually you know, so think that the the TVs are ultra expensive because at the factory they're making the big screens.

224
00:14:50,344 --> 00:14:51,900
Scott: You're getting even worse yields, right?

225
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:57,800
Scott: Cuz you make this giant screen and like a few pixels are bad You make more pixels better odds of some of them being busted, right?

226
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,958
Rym: Let's we're past the point where I'm.

227
00:14:58,978 --> 00:15:06,454
Rym: well I mean remember when LCDs were first around the idea of Returning one because it had five or six busted pixels wasn't a thing like.

228
00:15:06,474 --> 00:15:07,840
Rym: you couldn't return an LCD for that.

229
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,542
Rym: That was expected.

230
00:15:08,562 --> 00:15:09,926
Scott: Yeah, then Samsung figured that out.

231
00:15:10,086 --> 00:15:11,470
Scott: Yeah, but but now but now.

232
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:18,260
Scott: so you'll see OLEDs these days on like watches and Phones because you make it a smaller screen.

233
00:15:18,762 --> 00:15:22,160
Scott: More of the screens you make will turn out to be good because they're smaller.

234
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:26,700
Scott: You have a better shot of not fucking up any parts of it when you're making something smaller.

235
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,674
Rym: But well as fewer pixels smaller not miniaturized smaller, right?

236
00:15:30,734 --> 00:15:31,236
Scott: Right, right.

237
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:35,320
Scott: But yeah, so but the The giant TVs are like ultra expensive.

238
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:46,919
Scott: So if you win a lottery or you save up your money and you I guess Use your TV more than anything else cuz your cash potato you should invest in an OLED TV because they are besto And that's why I want to OLED phone.

239
00:15:47,642 --> 00:16:01,416
Scott: But otherwise if you don't have a fortune of money or TV is not the most important thing in your life Just get a normal screen the way cheaper like orders of magnitude cheaper for and the only thing you're getting is You know a little gray in the black area a big deal.

240
00:16:01,437 --> 00:16:01,900
Scott: You won't notice.

241
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,120
Rym: So I'm sure you all saw the news that Microsoft sent a computer recycler to jail and didn't really read the details of what happened.

242
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,160
Scott: Alright, so here's this story.

243
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,255
Scott: I think we actually may have reported this story a long time ago when the case started.

244
00:16:13,335 --> 00:16:14,400
Scott: but here's here's the deal.

245
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:19,220
Scott: Right as a guy and he runs a business a nonprofit act sort of thing, right?

246
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:36,289
Scott: I don't know the exact details, but it's one of those places that takes old computers Collects them all together takes out the good parts Recycles the bad parts and puts together working computers out of old parts and then you know gives them the people or places that need Computers and don't need a lot of horsepower.

247
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,240
Scott: right and you're you're saving so much in an environment.

248
00:16:39,543 --> 00:16:41,279
Scott: You're saving people who can't afford computers.

249
00:16:41,742 --> 00:16:42,888
Scott: It's such a great thing to do.

250
00:16:42,908 --> 00:16:45,380
Scott: the people come there and learn how to build computers.

251
00:16:45,883 --> 00:16:48,819
Scott: It's just like this multifaceted really great thing to do.

252
00:16:49,622 --> 00:16:52,851
Scott: So this dude I did a thing where he needed.

253
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,820
Scott: he wasn't pirating software necessarily, right?

254
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,860
Scott: Cuz you know, he wasn't making license keys Windows license keys.

255
00:16:59,243 --> 00:17:04,613
Scott: But when you're you know setting up these old computers They have these Windows stickers on them with the keys because it's some old case.

256
00:17:04,633 --> 00:17:07,323
Scott: you Dell case you found from 19, you know 2000 whatever.

257
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:11,940
Rym: Yep, and I think the OEM license you actually have to put it on some part of the computer, right?

258
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,207
Scott: So he's got this old Dell case.

259
00:17:13,227 --> 00:17:15,240
Scott: They put a new motherboard and stuff in there.

260
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,380
Scott: It's still the same computer with new parts and they got that Windows license on there.

261
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,260
Scott: That's legally belongs to that computer or whatever computer ends up in that box and they want to install Windows.

262
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,733
Scott: You need a Windows disk, you know, cuz those are old computers.

263
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:28,079
Scott: It's spinning optical drives.

264
00:17:28,704 --> 00:17:30,900
Scott: You need a Windows disk to install Windows on there.

265
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,452
Scott: So, you know, those aren't you know, the easiest to come by.

266
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:35,355
Scott: I saved all mine.

267
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,057
Scott: I got like Windows 95 B.

268
00:17:37,121 --> 00:17:41,313
Rym: Well, so like my my old laptop I got Windows 2000 my my current laptop.

269
00:17:41,413 --> 00:17:47,613
Rym: actually the OEM license keys Would not work with Windows 10 upgrade.

270
00:17:47,974 --> 00:17:49,118
Rym: There's a bunch of issues.

271
00:17:49,158 --> 00:17:49,760
Rym: We're just wouldn't?

272
00:17:50,585 --> 00:17:53,260
Scott: I started out my whole deal and got everything to work super great.

273
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,143
Rym: yeah, well part of us is.

274
00:17:54,183 --> 00:17:59,470
Rym: I'd also replaced the hard drive which had died and There was a spinning disk risk.

275
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,615
Rym: Well, there was a because it was dead.

276
00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:01,560
Rym: There's nothing I could do about it.

277
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:09,501
Rym: I meant you fucked up your license key, man There was a spinning disk recovery that could not deploy to the new drive Mm-hmm.

278
00:18:10,003 --> 00:18:13,516
Rym: So I ended up just buying a Windows 10 license and just installing on it.

279
00:18:13,536 --> 00:18:14,400
Rym: cuz I didn't want to deal with it.

280
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,648
Scott: I bought a Windows.

281
00:18:16,212 --> 00:18:31,080
Scott: I think I had a Windows Vista ultimate license and then I got it upgrade to Windows 7 Pro and then I took that license and I upgraded it to Windows 10 with the free upgrade.

282
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:31,309
Scott: Yeah.

283
00:18:31,801 --> 00:18:39,118
Scott: And then now it's in such a state that when I set up the new computer the one I just bought I Went to Amazon where I bought the keys from.

284
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,867
Scott: Legally, right.

285
00:18:41,189 --> 00:18:47,919
Scott: and you when you log into Amazon You can see there's a screen you can find in your account where all your keys for all the software you've ever bought are Still there for yep.

286
00:18:48,402 --> 00:18:58,637
Scott: And I took that last a very last key that upgrade key that I used to upgrade from 7 to 10 And that was the only key I needed plus my Microsoft account and it totally just installed legal windows on.

287
00:18:58,657 --> 00:19:01,709
Scott: that can nuke brand new Computer that had nothing to do with the computer that died.

288
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:03,376
Scott: So it totally works now.

289
00:19:03,436 --> 00:19:04,260
Rym: Well, not too shabby.

290
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,187
Rym: Anyway, I don't know computers.

291
00:19:06,227 --> 00:19:07,893
Rym: that often doesn't matter anymore.

292
00:19:07,973 --> 00:19:09,740
Scott: I needed for this to work.

293
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,954
Scott: He needed the Windows CDs with the old versions of Windows.

294
00:19:12,974 --> 00:19:19,296
Scott: So, you know, he Microsoft he mass manufactured these disks to get you know to give to people who need.

295
00:19:19,356 --> 00:19:20,300
Scott: we're making old computers.

296
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,580
Scott: and Then Microsoft took him to court was like counterfeiting piracy.

297
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:27,367
Scott: We're gonna sue you into oblivion you bad.

298
00:19:27,748 --> 00:19:32,000
Scott: and then now he lost and he going to jail for a 15 months or something.

299
00:19:32,361 --> 00:19:34,170
Rym: Well, it seems like the disks he was getting it.

300
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,440
Rym: It's this is where it gets sort of complicated long time.

301
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,867
Rym: He's going to jail cuz he was getting.

302
00:19:37,907 --> 00:19:39,697
Scott: you know, it's 15 years or 15 months.

303
00:19:39,938 --> 00:19:40,259
Rym: He was getting.

304
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,548
Rym: I don't know what it says in here.

305
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:44,615
Scott: Anyway, he wants right here.

306
00:19:44,656 --> 00:19:45,880
Scott: So he lost the court case.

307
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:51,860
Scott: He's going to jail and everyone is when you hear that story that I just told you're gonna get mad, right?

308
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,965
Scott: That's some bullshit right there.

309
00:19:53,006 --> 00:19:54,453
Scott: The guy was copying Windows disks.

310
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,167
Scott: He wasn't generating keys It wasn't pirating Windows.

311
00:19:57,267 --> 00:19:59,759
Scott: every one of those disks still needed a key to go with it, etc.

312
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:01,624
Scott: Here's the story.

313
00:20:01,684 --> 00:20:08,850
Scott: Microsoft actually put out a good press release that gave out information That changes your thoughts on this story a little bit.

314
00:20:08,911 --> 00:20:11,059
Scott: and there's the two things that change your thoughts in the story.

315
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:14,349
Scott: one He was not given out these discs for free.

316
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,300
Scott: He was charging a tiny amount of money for them.

317
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,912
Scott: But also there's like emails.

318
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:28,824
Scott: they showed that you know They were in court as evidence of him like expecting to profit from selling these discs and even so like I think if a he Hadn't been selling the discs.

319
00:20:28,864 --> 00:20:30,129
Scott: He just given away for zero.

320
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:33,020
Scott: I don't think Microsoft would have done a goddamn thing about it, right?

321
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:42,629
Scott: It's because he was charging money for them even though he was you know, not Selling the keys only the copies of the software, right?

322
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,114
Scott: So that's problem number one.

323
00:20:44,154 --> 00:20:51,720
Scott: and problem number two is He wasn't just going to make it a bunch of CD ours and scrolling windows on them with a sharpie, right?

324
00:20:51,920 --> 00:21:03,694
Scott: He had a place in China like mass manufacturing discs and he went through great effort to make them look exactly like Official legit windows discs with holograms on them and all that biz which is sort of like.

325
00:21:04,136 --> 00:21:05,680
Scott: why are you doing that now?

326
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,684
Scott: It looks like they were.

327
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:09,635
Scott: if you're really just trying to help people right, you know?

328
00:21:09,676 --> 00:21:14,038
Scott: get computers working Wouldn't you just take the one good disk you have and just get?

329
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:19,883
Scott: you know Just make crappy CD ours and scroll windows on him with a sharpie and give them out to everybody Right.

330
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:21,008
Scott: So that's the reason.

331
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:24,100
Scott: Microsoft went after him, but he still wasn't copying keys.

332
00:21:24,543 --> 00:21:26,780
Scott: So the end, you know, he wasn't making well he was copying.

333
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,127
Rym: Manufacturers like OEMs restore this right?

334
00:21:30,168 --> 00:21:31,912
Scott: So it's like he wasn't still copying.

335
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:36,467
Scott: discs are still useless without giving Microsoft money Right, so it's now.

336
00:21:36,527 --> 00:21:40,000
Scott: it's not necessarily this clear-cut thing where Microsoft is bad.

337
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,507
Scott: It's sort of like a half-and-half situation.

338
00:21:42,527 --> 00:21:43,911
Scott: We're like, yeah, he wasn't.

339
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:47,000
Scott: actually the discs are still useless without giving Microsoft money.

340
00:21:47,323 --> 00:21:51,626
Scott: He wasn't necessarily pirating the software But also he was sort of.

341
00:21:52,027 --> 00:21:57,000
Scott: why was he counterfeiting the discs so heavily and also not charging zero dollars for them?

342
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:04,636
Rym: Yep, and it looks like I mean, I haven't read too deeply but it looks like there's even more He might have been selling those discs to other PC recyclers.

343
00:22:04,776 --> 00:22:05,600
Scott: Yeah, that's what he was doing.

344
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:08,997
Rym: Yeah, as opposed to just using them to recycle pcs himself.

345
00:22:09,097 --> 00:22:12,140
Scott: No, no, right He was said he was selling them to other people who were in this.

346
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,578
Rym: I don't know if he was also recycling pcs or he was just recycling them, but also selling the.

347
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:19,485
Rym: yeah I guess the more.

348
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:23,920
Scott: really each recycling place only needs like one disc per like employee.

349
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,680
Scott: Okay, cuz right you build a computer you install Windows.

350
00:22:27,801 --> 00:22:29,429
Scott: Well, you just don't want to have to share the same.

351
00:22:29,751 --> 00:22:34,860
Rym: you can using the same disc in every computer And in fact if you want to really protect yourself use the disk to restore the computer.

352
00:22:35,261 --> 00:22:39,880
Rym: But you give the person the URL of how to download the manufacturers there.

353
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,779
Rym: So the person can redownload restore media themselves directly from the manufacturer without touching you.

354
00:22:45,101 --> 00:22:53,820
Scott: Microsoft doesn't and other manufacturers don't always provide the downloads of those Discs like ship with the computer and that's the only way you can get the disc separately.

355
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,347
Rym: I think there should be a law.

356
00:22:55,387 --> 00:23:02,932
Rym: there should be a certain amount of time like a decade after any Manufacturers sells a PC where they're obligated to provide restore media.

357
00:23:02,992 --> 00:23:06,282
Rym: Well, I think you know if they bundled the OS they should be responsible For it.

358
00:23:06,483 --> 00:23:11,000
Scott: Yeah, I mean a lot of how can PC hardware manufacturers do a good job of this you go to someone's website.

359
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,752
Scott: They got the drivers for fucking everything there.

360
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:13,800
Scott: Yeah, he's his website.

361
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:16,940
Scott: There must be so many drivers available there for every fucking motherboard.

362
00:23:17,321 --> 00:23:21,014
Rym: Yeah, right, you know doesn't do a job about this any scanner in the world.

363
00:23:21,034 --> 00:23:26,677
Scott: like every time Windows updates If you get a cannon or a brother those websites have all the.

364
00:23:26,918 --> 00:23:30,574
Rym: yeah They have drivers for like Windows 7 that don't work in Windows 10.

365
00:23:30,574 --> 00:23:31,920
Scott: Oh, yeah, they don't update that.

366
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,574
Scott: They're not supporting and providing drivers for newer OS.

367
00:23:34,715 --> 00:23:45,239
Rym: Yeah, that's true Yeah, but I guess the real moral here is when you see a story like this making the rounds and There's a very outrage worthy headline.

368
00:23:46,181 --> 00:23:51,039
Rym: Do at least a cursory read of the article because I'm almost everyone I've talked about this issue with.

369
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,441
Scott: well Cuz.

370
00:23:51,461 --> 00:23:56,382
Scott: the thing is a lot of the articles that came out were only telling that first half of the story and it was only After.

371
00:23:56,824 --> 00:24:00,500
Scott: like we told this story way back when it was new and it was only that first half.

372
00:24:00,561 --> 00:24:04,495
Scott: We didn't hear the other side And only now the dude was sentenced.

373
00:24:04,957 --> 00:24:08,571
Scott: and then people told that same first half of the story again.

374
00:24:08,612 --> 00:24:10,097
Scott: and those are first round of articles.

375
00:24:10,438 --> 00:24:16,520
Scott: and then Microsoft made a statement and then we got a second round of articles with that second half of the story only now.

376
00:24:16,942 --> 00:24:20,040
Scott: So it's like you didn't hear the whole story right away.

377
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:31,520
Scott: So you got to wait for you know, it's like you got to wait till you know everything that was go all those details Cuz you know even people who saw that story didn't bother to go read the court filings and look at the evidence or anything.

378
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:33,558
Rym: So some other news.

379
00:24:34,544 --> 00:24:42,234
Rym: If you haven't noticed there's been a lot of talk about how Cable TV and just TV services in general are completely tanking.

380
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:45,743
Scott: Of course because I talked about this That's not new.

381
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:50,080
Rym: So what's new is that Comcast in particular?

382
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,164
Rym: This is this partly.

383
00:24:52,184 --> 00:24:55,878
Rym: it's not just illustrate what Comcast is doing because Comcast has always been a pretty terrible company.

384
00:24:55,898 --> 00:25:01,400
Rym: the worst one It's the worst one, but it's more to show what the stakes are and like why?

385
00:25:02,262 --> 00:25:08,380
Rym: Why the industry is structured the way it is and why everything that's happening around this question is happening.

386
00:25:08,802 --> 00:25:13,180
Rym: Basically Comcast is increasing the speed of their internet in a bunch of places.

387
00:25:13,725 --> 00:25:19,075
Rym: So anyone who is nice of them So anyone who has 60 megabits down is gonna get up to 150 for free.

388
00:25:20,681 --> 00:25:24,556
Rym: Okay, anyone with 150 is getting 250 and with the 250 is good.

389
00:25:24,576 --> 00:25:26,885
Scott: It's upgrading all their tiers Yeah, everyone to 50s.

390
00:25:27,207 --> 00:25:29,356
Rym: So the 400 people are getting a gig.

391
00:25:29,798 --> 00:25:30,220
Scott: damn son.

392
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:34,616
Scott: Yeah gig doesn't say if it's symmetric cost a lot of money a month of you already getting 400.

393
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,620
Scott: What are you paying?

394
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:36,842
Scott: Yeah, right.

395
00:25:36,943 --> 00:25:39,372
Scott: I can get I can get like a ton from spectrum.

396
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:48,598
Rym: I gotta pay a hundred bucks a month, but They are only giving this free upgrade to people who also pay for TV.

397
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:53,060
Scott: Well, I mean that's a totally I guess legal business thing.

398
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:59,120
Scott: But on the other hand they have this regional monopoly and also Comcast is part of NBC, which is a TV company.

399
00:25:59,201 --> 00:26:02,220
Scott: So it's totally shady as fuck and could be antitrust.

400
00:26:02,621 --> 00:26:06,857
Scott: Maybe we should do some antitrust thing in there instead of letting them merge in the first place all those years ago.

401
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:07,520
Scott: Oops

402
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:20,618
Rym: Yeah, but yeah the stakes here for these cable companies is basically that They if they don't they need to boost the numbers of humans They can say have TV or else the entire thing breaks

403
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:22,187
Scott: good Fuck them meaning

404
00:26:22,489 --> 00:26:29,598
Rym: that they will very often Like they will do anything to get you even if you don't pay for it to have the TV service.

405
00:26:29,618 --> 00:26:34,340
Rym: and It'll be real interesting to see this all collapse in the near term.

406
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:47,952
Scott: Well, I mean, you know advertising has always been this sort of you know fraud Situation where people like lie about numbers or use numbers that are technically true, you know It's like because you're trying to sell ads you're trying to make someone else buy ads, right?

407
00:26:48,093 --> 00:26:50,000
Scott: Yeah ad seller you have inventory.

408
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:52,107
Scott: You're like buy an ad on my website.

409
00:26:52,148 --> 00:26:55,640
Scott: we have X uniques we have X views you have X impressions.

410
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,367
Scott: Yeah, you're always trying to inflate me.

411
00:26:57,427 --> 00:26:59,716
Scott: Our newsletter has this many subscribers.

412
00:26:59,776 --> 00:27:00,660
Scott: How many of those are fake?

413
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:04,760
Scott: I'm just saying somebody subscribers are you know, and you're not technically lying.

414
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:11,440
Scott: So you can't be sued for fraud even though it totally is a fraud because the meanings of those numbers are totally right.

415
00:27:11,781 --> 00:27:18,300
Scott: You're not telling the person here is how much money how much you'll actually get in return for the ad that you are buying.

416
00:27:18,641 --> 00:27:19,646
Scott: No one ever tells you that.

417
00:27:20,369 --> 00:27:22,739
Scott: Yeah, you would never buy the ad the price they're selling it for.

418
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,312
Scott: So, you know ratings on TV are simply the same exact thing.

419
00:27:27,392 --> 00:27:29,118
Scott: this many people watch our TV show.

420
00:27:29,318 --> 00:27:35,119
Scott: actually This guy on Twitch has like 7,000 people watching them all day long every day.

421
00:27:36,303 --> 00:27:38,619
Scott: How many people actually watch that baseball game?

422
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,420
Rym: Yeah, that's why eSports is so terrifying to a lot of industries because it's not a million.

423
00:27:43,681 --> 00:27:47,536
Rym: You can see exactly how many people are watching and it turns out it's a lot of people.

424
00:27:47,576 --> 00:27:49,243
Scott: in some cases turns out It's a lot of people.

425
00:27:49,324 --> 00:27:56,389
Scott: but also it turns out that that number nowhere near Approaches the numbers that like Nielsen ratings say they're getting.

426
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,957
Scott: but the Nielsen rating numbers are actually super.

427
00:27:59,117 --> 00:28:00,060
Scott: they're that inflated.

428
00:28:00,341 --> 00:28:02,509
Scott: They're actually like less right?

429
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:05,760
Scott: It's like we see how many people are watching League of Legends Championship.

430
00:28:05,921 --> 00:28:10,419
Scott: We know that that's bigger than like, you know some baseball playoff game.

431
00:28:11,042 --> 00:28:14,940
Scott: Yet the baseball playoff game is claiming to have these millions and millions of viewers.

432
00:28:15,182 --> 00:28:17,500
Scott: But it's probably just because the way they're counting is fraudulent.

433
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:25,040
Scott: Yeah and if they accounted the same way the League of Legends people counted you would see that they're smaller and then the whole can of worms collapse.

434
00:28:25,982 --> 00:28:36,378
Scott: There goes we see the man behind the curtain and then show But anyway things of the day what he got.

435
00:28:37,961 --> 00:28:39,045
Scott: Was this all right cells?

436
00:28:39,366 --> 00:28:39,727
Scott: Yeah.

437
00:28:39,767 --> 00:28:41,452
Scott: Yeah, so this is so.

438
00:28:41,894 --> 00:28:45,560
Scott: I didn't think I don't know how the hell they image this Which is really the amazing part of this, right?

439
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:57,495
Scott: But they took a zebra fish and they went to the zebra fish's inner ear Okay, and they somehow Captured imagery of the cells in the zebra fish's inner ear.

440
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,120
Scott: So we got like super microscope action.

441
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,860
Scott: You're seeing individual cells moving around right and it's also moving.

442
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:07,375
Scott: it's not like some dead cells on a plate with some electron microscope.

443
00:29:07,656 --> 00:29:11,712
Scott: is this video of Living cells moving the fuck around?

444
00:29:12,114 --> 00:29:13,200
Scott: and they're immune cells.

445
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,925
Scott: So you're seeing immune cells in the inner ear of zebra fish moving around Immunifying.

446
00:29:18,985 --> 00:29:22,510
Scott: I guess I don't know what the hell's going on But holy shit, look at that.

447
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:23,840
Scott: It's moving cells on a video.

448
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,447
Scott: Have you ever fucking seen that in your life?

449
00:29:25,608 --> 00:29:27,516
Scott: No, and that makes it thing of the day.

450
00:29:27,697 --> 00:29:28,280
Rym: That's pretty cool.

451
00:29:29,461 --> 00:29:37,500
Rym: So this was making the rounds Periodically, and I guess I just never bumped into it until now, but it's a little over sensationalized.

452
00:29:37,641 --> 00:29:51,810
Rym: But the gist of it is it's an accessory for the Gameboy Ostensibly the original Gameboy called pedicidates and Alright like the Gameboy Gameboy Gameboy with Tetris.

453
00:29:51,971 --> 00:29:52,252
Scott: Yep.

454
00:29:52,432 --> 00:30:00,555
Rym: Okay, but integrated with a contraption that will Administer nitrous oxide and knock you out while you're playing a game.

455
00:30:00,575 --> 00:30:04,280
Scott: I Mean I did have an orthodontist who had plenty of Gameboys.

456
00:30:04,441 --> 00:30:08,620
Scott: I played many Metroid twos and links awakenings in that orthodontist office.

457
00:30:09,062 --> 00:30:12,600
Scott: So the argument here was that it was just Gameboy did not have any accessory.

458
00:30:13,182 --> 00:30:14,406
Rym: It's an integration of.

459
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:22,771
Rym: you take a gaming system like the Gameboy that a kid would be used to and you couple it with What is basically just glorified headphones and a gas mask?

460
00:30:22,832 --> 00:30:25,500
Scott: So why did I don't understand why it needed to be an accessory?

461
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,280
Scott: What did it accomplish by connecting to the Gameboy?

462
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:34,240
Scott: You could have just given a kid a Gameboy and then also administered the nitrous oxide while they're distracted by the Gameboy.

463
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:42,020
Scott: Yeah, what do you need to attach the delivery mechanism to the Gameboy for so the kid the kids controlling the release with the game?

464
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,870
Rym: No It does is the only the only point of integration.

465
00:30:44,931 --> 00:30:48,718
Rym: as far as I can tell looking at this thing is it's just headphones with a guest thing.

466
00:30:49,804 --> 00:31:04,577
Rym: It has nothing to do with the Gameboy except it was designed for the Gameboy and I suspect the only reason it was actually designed and pride and socialized this way was to probably get some grant money around using gay like.

467
00:31:04,597 --> 00:31:10,820
Rym: there's probably some reason why They framed this as a Gameboy accessory, but really it's just gas headphones.

468
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:13,058
Scott: Okay.

469
00:31:14,021 --> 00:31:17,633
Rym: So because I bought a new smartphone or just talking about smartphones and we got no other.

470
00:31:17,653 --> 00:31:18,456
Scott: Monday show ideas.

471
00:31:18,496 --> 00:31:20,967
Scott: send your Monday show ideas - yeah nights at front row.

472
00:31:20,987 --> 00:31:22,860
Scott: crew calm and you skip the meta moment.

473
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:27,180
Rym: Alright the meta moment the booklet book is still Emily Wilson's translation.

474
00:31:27,321 --> 00:31:32,519
Scott: Oh, I said I would read more of it during when I was not working last week and I did not.

475
00:31:34,982 --> 00:31:36,026
Rym: So you're still hanging out with.

476
00:31:36,267 --> 00:31:38,635
Rym: uh, I guess you just got your dishes.

477
00:31:38,695 --> 00:31:40,040
Scott: I read zero more pages.

478
00:31:40,321 --> 00:31:42,751
Rym: So you had just gotten to Odysseus making his raft.

479
00:31:43,012 --> 00:31:45,443
Scott: I think I read yeah, pretty much He didn't get out.

480
00:31:45,463 --> 00:31:47,573
Rym: Did he get off the eye that he meet an Ashka yet?

481
00:31:48,076 --> 00:31:51,127
Scott: No, okay Yeah, yeah, I also did not know.

482
00:31:51,227 --> 00:31:53,855
Scott: before I can I want to tell you this I did not know.

483
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:57,113
Scott: I knew now she could was Only a Miyazaki character to me.

484
00:31:57,133 --> 00:32:00,580
Scott: Ah Did not know that that name came from anywhere.

485
00:32:00,741 --> 00:32:10,696
Rym: It really seems like most people who started the Odyssey in high school only read Specific excerpts from it because so many people have said to me that they didn't know.

486
00:32:10,777 --> 00:32:11,980
Rym: it started with Telemachus.

487
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,489
Scott: I knew that and because I had to pop.

488
00:32:14,529 --> 00:32:17,219
Rym: they don't know about characters like Nausicaa because I didn't know about.

489
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:24,360
Rym: now Everyone seems to start with like the Cyclops stuff and like a couple of spits of odds of.

490
00:32:25,441 --> 00:32:32,680
Scott: Actually, you know that taught me the most about the Odyssey when I was young was not any class in school or anything like that.

491
00:32:33,122 --> 00:32:46,807
Scott: It was a multi-part DuckTales episode Yeah in which they dealt with the I don't know if the Cyclops was in it, but there was the the the whirlpool the They.

492
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:56,340
Scott: they sailed in between You know like a colossus and then they got to Cersei who was just magic at the spell and uh in a place And I think they're also sirens.

493
00:32:57,562 --> 00:32:59,312
Scott: Yeah, I should find that and rewatch it.

494
00:32:59,674 --> 00:33:12,340
Scott: Oh, yeah, that's good stuff otherwise, so that did obviously did not include Telemachus or a wife or suitors or Nausicaa or hundreds and hundreds of slaves or a hot Calypso keeping Scrooge McDuck hostage on a island.

495
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:18,145
Scott: Not included in the DuckTales Just the adventuring part.

496
00:33:18,586 --> 00:33:22,378
Rym: So this weekend I without Scott will be live for GeekNights at Zenkai Con.

497
00:33:22,678 --> 00:33:26,014
Rym: on Saturday I'm doing my anime openers panel one last time.

498
00:33:26,054 --> 00:33:28,840
Scott: before I retire it forever I'll be biking in beautiful weather.

499
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:29,202
Scott: the only

500
00:33:29,222 --> 00:33:42,760
Rym: reason I'm retiring it is because it's a pain to Update it and I don't want to can and also most of the videos I want to get for it are Increasingly taken down from YouTube and it's not worth the effort to find like weird openers to anime around the world.

501
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:50,240
Rym: So I'm retiring this one the last time I'm ever gonna run it and I'm doing a brand new anime panel And I'm also redoing one of our PAX panels.

502
00:33:50,621 --> 00:34:01,735
Rym: but if you're gonna be a Zenkai Con on Saturday or Sunday, you can see me there and Otherwise, I'm just gonna be playing board games Maybe in tabletop at the con or possibly just like in a hotel room.

503
00:34:01,836 --> 00:34:02,679
Rym: and good luck finding me.

504
00:34:04,022 --> 00:34:05,129
Scott: It sounds like a safer idea.

505
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:17,498
Rym: So yeah smartphone sales independent oh kind of like it's tied to all this stuff we talked about the beginning are dropping pretty Rapidly, it's cuz no new phones come out that are compellingly better than the phones we got.

506
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:25,960
Rym: Yep So I just pointed out a newer iteration of a phone that I like is actually in almost every material way worse Than the phone it's replacing.

507
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:31,449
Rym: and simultaneously You notice that smart watches after their big splash.

508
00:34:31,931 --> 00:34:41,918
Rym: Those aren't selling well because it turns out a lot of people didn't really understand why they wanted a smart watch and Smart watches by and large have a pretty bad UX.

509
00:34:43,002 --> 00:34:44,672
Rym: Like nothing's really been better than the pebble.

510
00:34:44,973 --> 00:34:46,080
Rym: You can't buy the pebble anymore.

511
00:34:46,944 --> 00:34:51,599
Rym: So I guess I'm wondering Partly cuz we need to come over the Monday show that wouldn't take too long.

512
00:34:52,101 --> 00:35:01,420
Rym: I would have something to say about what would water real material things That could change that would make like you or me for example, what would make you excited to buy a phone?

513
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,009
Rym: I mean they're like what would make you be willing to.

514
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:09,353
Scott: the problem is is that back in the day phones are so shitty that You could easily imagine ways to improve them right.

515
00:35:09,393 --> 00:35:13,520
Scott: the cameras are so bad The data was so slow the battery ran out.

516
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:18,260
Rym: So let them plug into my computer with USB and not a proprietary cable screen was so shitty.

517
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,862
Scott: The there were.

518
00:35:18,923 --> 00:35:23,240
Scott: you know, there's so many things that were just obviously bad about the phone that could easily be improved.

519
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,387
Rym: Let me access the internet.

520
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:25,676
Scott: Yeah, let me have apps.

521
00:35:25,937 --> 00:35:26,360
Scott: iPhone one.

522
00:35:28,361 --> 00:35:33,180
Scott: They added the absolute later iOS update when the iPhone 3G came out which is when I bought it like a smart person.

523
00:35:34,082 --> 00:35:37,120
Scott: Anyway, you know, so there's so many obvious problems.

524
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:40,720
Scott: But now it's like what can you really offer me in the next phone?

525
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,962
Scott: We already talked about the OLED screen, but that alone is not Super.

526
00:35:45,022 --> 00:35:48,093
Scott: it's nice, you know, but it's not super compelling like oh man.

527
00:35:48,133 --> 00:35:49,940
Scott: I gotta had that phone right away, right?

528
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,085
Scott: You can make the camera better.

529
00:35:51,367 --> 00:35:52,613
Scott: You can make the CPU faster.

530
00:35:52,654 --> 00:35:53,900
Scott: You make the battery last longer.

531
00:35:53,961 --> 00:35:55,660
Scott: You can even make the data faster.

532
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,890
Scott: That's one thing that you sort of almost forces you to upgrade.

533
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:05,860
Scott: if they come out with like 5g 6g New radios you sort of had to buy a new phone.

534
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,311
Rym: Oh, but even then unless the until the infrastructure upgrades like yeah.

535
00:36:09,331 --> 00:36:13,280
Scott: Yeah, but I'm saying then I'm saying at that point You're gonna have to do something.

536
00:36:13,345 --> 00:36:17,131
Rym: Yeah Well like the difference between 3g and 4g is night and day.

537
00:36:17,171 --> 00:36:22,235
Scott: the difference in 4g and 5g though is supposedly not much because we're Not even using all the bandwidth possible on 4g.

538
00:36:22,255 --> 00:36:30,320
Rym: Oh, yeah I thought I stopped holding on to my unlimited grandfathered Plan because I'd never use more than a few gigs a month ever.

539
00:36:30,641 --> 00:36:40,056
Scott: And the other problem is that not only are the new phones coming out these days only marginally better than the previous phones But the previous phones are still working just fine.

540
00:36:40,096 --> 00:36:40,880
Scott: It's not like they died.

541
00:36:41,163 --> 00:36:46,132
Rym: Yeah, look I just bought a new phone But I still have my old phone for the first time also the new ones.

542
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:48,500
Scott: the price has gotten exorbitant.

543
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:55,099
Scott: There's been sort of this decreasing returns where to make the phone a little bit better costs a fortune more money.

544
00:36:56,063 --> 00:36:56,848
Scott: That's not worth it.

545
00:36:56,928 --> 00:37:12,029
Scott: if it was like yeah for that nicer screen I'd give you 50 more bucks or a hundred more bucks or something like that, but not for a $1,000 iPhone X. but no, it's not worth for just that for a little screen and also this feature I don't care about where it looks at my face.

546
00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:12,773
Scott: I don't even want that.

547
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:13,657
Scott: I'd probably disable it.

548
00:37:13,939 --> 00:37:15,519
Scott: Yeah No, I don't want that.

549
00:37:15,881 --> 00:37:16,563
Rym: So what could?

550
00:37:17,085 --> 00:37:18,690
Rym: what could phones materially do?

551
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,740
Rym: because it seems like they're mostly focused on more pixels.

552
00:37:22,423 --> 00:37:25,336
Rym: Higher quality pixels are good pixel density.

553
00:37:25,356 --> 00:37:26,200
Scott: Those are good things.

554
00:37:26,502 --> 00:37:28,840
Scott: But yeah, but they don't not making that big a difference.

555
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:34,820
Rym: But they also considering that people want these giant phones the ultra high res does not buy much for the average phone user.

556
00:37:35,162 --> 00:37:38,820
Scott: No, I mean the things that I want, you know, for example are you know?

557
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,660
Scott: If that iPhone the one thing you can always complain about the iPhone is that there's no SD card slot.

558
00:37:43,821 --> 00:37:46,438
Rym: Yeah, I have it an SD card slot in a phone.

559
00:37:46,981 --> 00:37:54,500
Scott: Now that I've been used to have an SD card lightning reader which works but actually is kind of way slow If you have a ton of photos on there.

560
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,740
Scott: I usually use it for putting photos from my camera into the iPad or iPhone.

561
00:38:00,182 --> 00:38:00,885
Scott: It works like you.

562
00:38:00,905 --> 00:38:06,040
Scott: plug the thing in the lightning hole and you put the SD card in it and then Importer shows up and it works nicely.

563
00:38:06,361 --> 00:38:09,033
Scott: But it's kind of slow you to wait for all the photos to appear.

564
00:38:09,094 --> 00:38:11,758
Scott: if it took a ton of raw photos It's you gotta wait.

565
00:38:12,183 --> 00:38:18,481
Scott: So, I think the first material thing I can think of It would be nice if it was just like put an SD card right in the in the iPad or the iPhone and boop Like.

566
00:38:18,521 --> 00:38:26,445
Rym: I think the next real phone revolution like something that would actually change the market would be if there were a battery that lasted More than a day or two.

567
00:38:26,465 --> 00:38:29,840
Rym: Mmm, like that would be the killer app for most people.

568
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:33,639
Scott: There are a lot of people who want that but I mean that's personally never been a problem for me.

569
00:38:34,462 --> 00:38:44,040
Scott: It's only been like a minor inconvenience because the only times my battery comes close to even going down are Days where I'm out and about the whole day which yep, which is for me rare.

570
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:48,600
Scott: Usually I'm at a desk all day and my phone is plugged in whenever I'm near a thing to plug it.

571
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:57,876
Rym: Yeah, and usually when I when I wear my phone out or when I need battery when I'm using it all day It's cuz I'm doing an activity like hiking all day like if I biking all day with Strava.

572
00:38:57,916 --> 00:39:01,689
Scott: if I bike all day I have a little cylinder right of battery.

573
00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:02,933
Scott: Yeah, I fully charge it.

574
00:39:02,953 --> 00:39:11,574
Scott: the night before I leave my phone plugged into it I have that same cylinder and when I get home My phone is still at a hundred percent and the cylinder is not a hundred percent empty.

575
00:39:11,594 --> 00:39:18,844
Scott: that cylinder holds so much energy And it's still that cylinder is a minor Inconvenience, right?

576
00:39:19,085 --> 00:39:23,300
Scott: So being able to get rid of it because the battery and the phone was just so fucking awesome would be nice.

577
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,974
Scott: Yeah, but it's not worth paying more than you know, 50 to 100 dollars.

578
00:39:27,054 --> 00:39:28,580
Rym: Well, I guess it would be material different.

579
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:33,534
Rym: I'm talking like the difference between the pebble smartwatch and any other smartwatch.

580
00:39:33,594 --> 00:39:35,139
Rym: It's not the difference of oh it lasts 50% longer.

581
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,579
Rym: I'm talking like what if it lasted more than a week?

582
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:39,783
Scott: Yeah, but I mean like.

583
00:39:39,964 --> 00:39:42,300
Scott: I can still like plug my any week.

584
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,700
Scott: I can plug my phone and what benefit do I actually get from the battery lasting a week?

585
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:51,803
Rym: Yeah, but I noticed once I switched from my pebble to this it's it's such a minor and trivial Inconvenience.

586
00:39:51,844 --> 00:39:55,120
Rym: just to make sure I'm charging my like every night put my watch on the charger before I go to bed.

587
00:39:55,702 --> 00:39:56,707
Scott: But I had.

588
00:39:56,747 --> 00:39:58,998
Scott: the thing is that's not like an inconvenience for me.

589
00:39:59,058 --> 00:39:59,480
Scott: It's a habit.

590
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:03,640
Scott: It's not even like a problem true, but I had carrying the cylinder is a minor problem.

591
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:18,554
Rym: But I had lived for a while in a world where I would travel without even bringing a charger for my smartwatch Mm-hmm, and because the pebble just lasted a week plus Mm-hmm, uh, I don't feel like screens will really get better in a material way.

592
00:40:18,594 --> 00:40:22,681
Rym: that would matter and if you make them bigger They're just laptops or tablets again That's not.

593
00:40:22,802 --> 00:40:23,505
Scott: I mean you could.

594
00:40:23,525 --> 00:40:27,420
Scott: you know people have always tried to make that thing where you put the phone in something, right?

595
00:40:27,724 --> 00:40:47,200
Scott: Yeah So if you made a phone that was truly somehow so powerful like it's got a 1080 and an i7 in it That powerful that it could be your computer Then yes That would be compelling because then I could throw away all my computers and when I'm home I could just plug the phone in and then he would have monitors and keyboards on my desk.

596
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:52,460
Scott: But actually I'll just have this phone and I wouldn't have to have any desktops or HDP C's or any other computers.

597
00:40:52,460 --> 00:41:00,355
Scott: I could just have this one tiny thing that has this Incredible horsepower of a 1080 and I do literally everything on it and that would be terrific.

598
00:41:00,656 --> 00:41:10,207
Scott: and I would only need one computer instead of one two Five or six computers that I have You know, so that would be compelling.

599
00:41:10,247 --> 00:41:14,939
Scott: but that ain't coming till I'm an old man, yeah when I'm old man That's how strong a phone will be.

600
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:18,208
Rym: I still really want and I feel like this will happen at some maybe

601
00:41:18,248 --> 00:41:18,870
Scott: not even then

602
00:41:19,331 --> 00:41:36,900
Rym: the like periphery cloud of Interface devices and the phone and I'm making quote fingers here It's basically just everything that my phone does except the screen and it's literally just the batteries and communications And horsepower to connect to all my cloud shit and to do local processing.

603
00:41:37,522 --> 00:41:44,865
Rym: but then I carry around like I have a bunch of screens and I use whichever one I want or I have a smartwatch and Some glasses.

604
00:41:44,906 --> 00:41:47,940
Scott: that's way better than the same things people always imagined, right?

605
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:54,960
Scott: But I mean really what we got to do is get to the point where you know You don't have to carry around a CPU in a video card or anything.

606
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:59,573
Scott: You just have literally just glasses that are non dorky or not.

607
00:41:59,653 --> 00:42:03,625
Rym: Even any glasses like it's like dorky Dorky is fine.

608
00:42:03,987 --> 00:42:04,933
Rym: No, why?

609
00:42:05,094 --> 00:42:06,060
Rym: why do you care about aesthetics?

610
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,967
Scott: Because it gets in the way.

611
00:42:09,208 --> 00:42:12,220
Scott: Oh, how do you like unlike you my eyes work?

612
00:42:13,101 --> 00:42:16,900
Scott: So I don't need to put any garbage on my face except to block the horrible rays of the Sun.

613
00:42:17,081 --> 00:42:18,168
Rym: I already wore glasses.

614
00:42:18,228 --> 00:42:19,960
Rym: So glasses that do something is just great.

615
00:42:20,181 --> 00:42:23,840
Scott: Yeah for me, it's I don't want to hang and I don't want to have to put anything on.

616
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,900
Scott: I want to get to the point where it's like a sticker.

617
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:29,624
Scott: I just put a sticker on the side of my head like One right.

618
00:42:29,644 --> 00:42:36,791
Scott: I get a little tiny sparkly spec and actually it projects everything in front of my face like it's cyberpunk land I am curious about.

619
00:42:36,811 --> 00:42:45,180
Rym: I think another a big No one else will be the because the the second screen peripherals tended to not go that well.

620
00:42:45,561 --> 00:42:58,160
Rym: I feel like these screen peripherals that are some sort of contact lens that can give an AR overlay like that sort of Technology, I don't have to poke my eyeball but the caveat to that is that again?

621
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:03,180
Rym: That's the kind of technology that I want But I don't know what a consumer like kids might be into it.

622
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:03,702
Scott: But I don't know what.

623
00:43:03,823 --> 00:43:07,460
Scott: the only reason I want that sort of thing is to carry around less shit.

624
00:43:07,562 --> 00:43:08,218
Scott: It's the same as me.

625
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:14,619
Scott: It's really just making the phone smaller and it's just another way to make the phone even more ridiculously small To make it invisible.

626
00:43:15,282 --> 00:43:21,104
Rym: But I guess I do want heads-up display like I want to be able to see information from my phone without having to get my Phone out.

627
00:43:21,792 --> 00:43:23,872
Scott: Yeah smartwatch Same thing is.

628
00:43:23,912 --> 00:43:24,820
Scott: making the phone smaller.

629
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,179
Scott: Yeah, make it so small that you can wear it next to your eye or in your eye.

630
00:43:28,488 --> 00:43:33,920
Scott: Oh, yeah It is your eye or it's in your ears in your brain and someone like it goes to the shell style is gonna be.

631
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,372
Scott: It's the same thing as making it smaller, right?

632
00:43:37,472 --> 00:43:39,220
Scott: It accomplishes the same goal.

633
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:47,527
Scott: It's just when you reach a ridiculous level of smallness suddenly new things become possible like Having it in front of your eyeball.

634
00:43:47,607 --> 00:43:50,800
Rym: So what about people who aren't super techie or don't care that much about this stuff?

635
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,939
Rym: Is there anything we could do to make smartphones better for them?

636
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:56,269
Rym: like anything that would compel them to upgrade?

637
00:43:56,289 --> 00:44:02,319
Scott: I Mean you make marketing compel them to buy them.

638
00:44:02,881 --> 00:44:07,600
Scott: Oh, yeah marketing problem not a technology problem because technology doesn't convince those people that you know.

639
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:11,440
Scott: If you're not a person who cares about technology, then you're not gonna care about technology.

640
00:44:12,401 --> 00:44:13,083
Scott: Yeah, right.

641
00:44:13,424 --> 00:44:14,106
Scott: You did.

642
00:44:14,146 --> 00:44:17,435
Scott: you just buy what you know marketing would makes you buy.

643
00:44:17,796 --> 00:44:19,020
Scott: you're convinced to buy something?

644
00:44:19,065 --> 00:44:24,280
Rym: Yeah because nerds always seem to go that like I see every now and then I see that perennial story of some nerd is like.

645
00:44:24,781 --> 00:44:28,194
Rym: The real answer is we need modular smartphone so I can build my own.

646
00:44:28,214 --> 00:44:28,635
Rym: It's like son.

647
00:44:28,655 --> 00:44:30,982
Rym: You can't even build your own laptop There.

648
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,148
Rym: no one's gonna let you build a phone.

649
00:44:32,168 --> 00:44:34,620
Rym: There's a reason why they're manufactured the way they are.

650
00:44:35,021 --> 00:44:40,293
Rym: No one wants a modular phone where you could like swap out the processor except you.

651
00:44:40,313 --> 00:44:41,697
Rym: I don't even want that.

652
00:44:41,717 --> 00:44:48,580
Scott: I Mean, I guess you could have a magical phone that like, you know is small and then can get big and then get small again.

653
00:44:49,002 --> 00:44:52,019
Rym: Oh someone in the chat actually points out a phone that could actually play real games.

654
00:44:52,842 --> 00:44:53,644
Scott: I mean iPhone.

655
00:44:53,684 --> 00:44:55,449
Scott: iPad can play real games to a degree.

656
00:44:55,469 --> 00:44:57,936
Scott: I mean the pie phone can't play.

657
00:44:57,976 --> 00:44:59,480
Rym: what's it about battle tech?

658
00:45:00,702 --> 00:45:01,145
Scott: Why couldn't it?

659
00:45:01,648 --> 00:45:03,882
Rym: Well, it can't right now because it won't run on iOS I assume.

660
00:45:04,023 --> 00:45:08,139
Scott: well, I mean it hasn't been written for it, but you can get the same exact xcom that is on.

661
00:45:09,221 --> 00:45:10,024
Scott: You can get for iPad.

662
00:45:10,225 --> 00:45:11,891
Scott: I had I got said iPhone.

663
00:45:11,931 --> 00:45:13,176
Scott: I got sib6 on my iPad.

664
00:45:13,276 --> 00:45:14,320
Rym: I pad not iPhone.

665
00:45:14,621 --> 00:45:15,444
Scott: You can get it for iPhone.

666
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:16,567
Scott: I'm sure are you sure?

667
00:45:16,607 --> 00:45:17,209
Scott: reason you couldn't?

668
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:20,440
Scott: Yeah, but actually you just the graphics be cut down.

669
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:25,660
Scott: But there's no there's no technological reason you could not make such a game for the iPhone.

670
00:45:27,402 --> 00:45:31,200
Scott: You know other than you just have to cut the graphics down because the GPU is not as powerful.

671
00:45:31,961 --> 00:45:33,767
Rym: But you see you keep saying could could.

672
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:37,380
Rym: is it actually a game that is playable today on an iPhone?

673
00:45:38,582 --> 00:45:41,991
Scott: No one has made the software doesn't mean that has nothing to do with the hardware.

674
00:45:42,011 --> 00:45:42,734
Scott: Right?

675
00:45:43,135 --> 00:45:43,415
Scott: It's like.

676
00:45:43,456 --> 00:45:44,479
Scott: what if by that logic?

677
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,907
Scott: That's like if I got it if I got a logic.

678
00:45:46,987 --> 00:45:50,521
Rym: Apple computers are fine for gaming because you could run any of these games On them.

679
00:45:50,863 --> 00:45:52,649
Scott: I'm just saying but there's nothing that Apple can.

680
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:57,509
Scott: what if I have a PC with a 1080 and he's just like oh Well, nobody they release a game from Mac.

681
00:45:57,549 --> 00:45:58,212
Scott: That's ridiculous.

682
00:45:58,272 --> 00:46:03,880
Rym: It's no one makes a good game for Mac Also on PC saying it's like oh it's not out on that platform.

683
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:09,800
Scott: Therefore that you know, it's like well, there's nothing the platform can do to make someone who writes software write it for that platform.

684
00:46:09,941 --> 00:46:10,445
Scott: That's stupid.

685
00:46:10,627 --> 00:46:15,243
Rym: Oh, yeah, but if the put but if it doesn't exist It's already the plat.

686
00:46:15,263 --> 00:46:23,520
Scott: the hardware is already capable of running the software right and Making that software for it is not the job of the person who makes the phones.

687
00:46:24,361 --> 00:46:26,228
Scott: It's not a part of this conversation.

688
00:46:26,509 --> 00:46:29,140
Scott: You can have real games on a smartphone these days.

689
00:46:29,501 --> 00:46:32,616
Rym: Well that to a degree the only mean what about your you keep?

690
00:46:32,636 --> 00:46:33,560
Rym: seems like real game.

691
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,673
Rym: What do you mean by real game?

692
00:46:34,775 --> 00:46:37,651
Rym: Because Fortnight is the only game that like normal people care.

693
00:46:37,732 --> 00:46:38,294
Scott: It's on phones.

694
00:46:38,435 --> 00:46:39,480
Scott: Yeah, I know it's on iPhone, right?

695
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,707
Rym: That's on phone and that's.

696
00:46:40,767 --> 00:46:42,980
Rym: that's a real game to most of G's on phones, right?

697
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,006
Scott: Yeah, so those are the top games.

698
00:46:45,347 --> 00:46:49,100
Rym: there are phones the end and that doesn't seem to be driving smartphone sales.

699
00:46:49,801 --> 00:46:50,605
Scott: No, it's just driving.

700
00:46:50,645 --> 00:46:52,976
Scott: people have phones to give more money to Fortnight and pub G.

701
00:46:53,177 --> 00:47:03,985
Rym: Yeah, I Just I don't know if there's any Material advancement to a smartphone that would change the situation for the average PCs had the same thing.

702
00:47:04,005 --> 00:47:05,511
Scott: they got better and better and better and better.

703
00:47:05,551 --> 00:47:07,218
Scott: and now what if what is change?

704
00:47:07,258 --> 00:47:13,518
Scott: what has made a PC better in the past X years Besides just being faster and better for normal people?

705
00:47:13,558 --> 00:47:16,309
Rym: nothing They don't use only real just use phones and tablets.

706
00:47:16,389 --> 00:47:23,552
Scott: only real thing that has come to PCs and that as Recently, that is not just faster and better is high DPI screens.

707
00:47:24,034 --> 00:47:25,377
Scott: Yeah, other than that.

708
00:47:25,578 --> 00:47:28,917
Scott: It's like, okay They're just faster and stronger with more memories and more chippies.

709
00:47:29,822 --> 00:47:31,467
Rym: Yeah, but PCs are already coming.

710
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:32,973
Scott: phones have reached the same thing.

711
00:47:33,093 --> 00:47:35,060
Scott: It's like well, we've made him as good as we can.

712
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:35,743
Scott: What else can we do?

713
00:47:35,904 --> 00:47:41,328
Scott: I guess what I find interesting is that last time someone made cars better It's like the engines got way way better.

714
00:47:41,368 --> 00:47:44,800
Rym: And now oh the edges actually have continued to get much more efficient.

715
00:47:45,502 --> 00:47:47,108
Scott: Yeah, just like CPUs.

716
00:47:47,128 --> 00:47:50,400
Scott: They keep getting slightly better, but cars, you know four wheels and they go.

717
00:47:51,141 --> 00:47:58,392
Rym: No, but there have been a lot of material changes that made like make a new car today Objectively superior to a car you could have bought a few years ago.

718
00:47:58,413 --> 00:48:02,467
Scott: with our crazy rate of improvement You know tapers off at a certain point.

719
00:48:02,507 --> 00:48:09,625
Scott: the dramatic change of the say between a 50s car and an 80s car versus the difference between a 2000s car and a 2010s car.

720
00:48:09,646 --> 00:48:10,990
Rym: a lot of people say wireless charging.

721
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:13,820
Rym: wireless charging has come and gone a million times in phones.

722
00:48:14,181 --> 00:48:16,410
Rym: It's never more convenient than just plugging it in.

723
00:48:16,471 --> 00:48:16,732
Scott: why?

724
00:48:16,772 --> 00:48:18,800
Scott: right wireless charging is cool.

725
00:48:19,082 --> 00:48:23,906
Rym: We have it in certain phones Starbucks is used to have like pads Phone on if it was to.

726
00:48:23,966 --> 00:48:25,952
Scott: the two problems is why and it works.

727
00:48:26,334 --> 00:48:33,220
Scott: the problems of the wireless charging is one It's not really more convenient because you still have to put your phone in a certain like spot.

728
00:48:33,381 --> 00:48:38,120
Scott: It's what's the difference between putting it on a pad and putting it in a neck in a near a wire?

729
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:41,372
Scott: The wire is actually more convenient because you can pick up the phone and move it around.

730
00:48:41,393 --> 00:48:43,020
Scott: you're gonna leave it on this spot.

731
00:48:43,346 --> 00:48:49,160
Scott: Yeah, right Wireless charging would be great if like it was just wireless charging being beamed everywhere.

732
00:48:49,421 --> 00:48:53,059
Scott: So as you walk down the street, you're this thing's shooting at your phone charging it up.

733
00:48:53,361 --> 00:48:54,689
Scott: That's wireless charging.

734
00:48:55,031 --> 00:48:59,411
Rym: something like that might exist someday But for right now pretty sure most get rid of.

735
00:48:59,611 --> 00:49:04,180
Scott: you know, we've made everything made all the all these technologies We've been able to remove the wires, right?

736
00:49:04,581 --> 00:49:04,864
Scott: It's like.

737
00:49:04,884 --> 00:49:09,308
Scott: well if you want to remove wires for power You need to remove the power grid like.

738
00:49:09,549 --> 00:49:11,054
Scott: you don't have to plug in your TV.

739
00:49:11,235 --> 00:49:12,700
Scott: There's just power in the air.

740
00:49:13,101 --> 00:49:15,130
Scott: I don't have to plug in your microwave.

741
00:49:15,331 --> 00:49:17,300
Scott: There's just power in the air, right?

742
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,340
Scott: You don't have to plug in your phone to charge everywhere.

743
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:27,520
Scott: Electronic devices that are in this area are just all being powered with electricity shooting through the sky if that's even physically possible.

744
00:49:27,841 --> 00:49:31,314
Scott: Yeah, right, but yeah, no more outlets in your walls in your house.

745
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:34,987
Scott: No more power lines outside Right just power everywhere.

746
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:38,020
Rym: I guess what's interesting though is that and your guts getting fried?

747
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:51,595
Rym: I guess he sees partly like that market got gutted by the Introduction of smartphones and tablets that were good enough for the things that an average person They did all the things that a person does with the computer only smaller and more convenient and easier.

748
00:49:51,936 --> 00:49:57,120
Rym: but smartphones There isn't anything that really is teed up to replace them.

749
00:49:57,261 --> 00:50:03,880
Rym: So they replaced PCs for a lot of people But they're already good enough to do everything that most people would have done with a PC and now do with their phone.

750
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:14,280
Scott: Actually, you know if you if you could imagine, you know, here's a real material Imagine the thing that would replace smartphones and be the next thing that ramps up and then tapers off.

751
00:50:15,341 --> 00:50:17,305
Scott: You would be yeah not have to work.

752
00:50:17,686 --> 00:50:22,477
Rym: I think a material change would be a phone that was actually pretty invincible.

753
00:50:22,497 --> 00:50:25,752
Scott: I Mean, that's a help because it makes me want to buy.

754
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:28,991
Rym: I think a full third of all the phones I see in the wild have cracked screens.

755
00:50:29,052 --> 00:50:36,202
Scott: They have invincible phones Relatively, but they're sort of a you know, are more or they're boutique like so full Elegant.

756
00:50:36,402 --> 00:50:41,459
Rym: I am NOT going to test my new contacts, but the previous one the one that I replaced.

757
00:50:41,479 --> 00:50:45,212
Rym: I Have beaten the ever-living shit out of this phone.

758
00:50:45,674 --> 00:50:46,960
Rym: I dropped it at work.

759
00:50:47,141 --> 00:50:49,258
Scott: I haven't put an iPhone in a case since the iPhone 3g.

760
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,707
Rym: I've never put a phone in a case.

761
00:50:50,727 --> 00:50:53,341
Scott: the only time one broke was the iPhone 5.

762
00:50:53,341 --> 00:51:02,209
Scott: I was riding my bike and it was in my bag and I fell over and I guess just the whatever hit the ground just Happened to spike into the phone.

763
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:06,240
Rym: So despite having gone swimming with this phone Used it in the shower.

764
00:51:06,461 --> 00:51:12,130
Scott: I think my iPhone 6 I had in my pocket and I was waiting into some water and then I think it got half in the water.

765
00:51:12,191 --> 00:51:13,415
Scott: I went oops and I put it.

766
00:51:13,455 --> 00:51:15,678
Scott: I went back out and Then it was totally fine.

767
00:51:16,301 --> 00:51:32,053
Rym: But I dropped this in a stairwell and it bounced down two full stories on concrete and There was a couple of tiny dents in the case The screen was uncracked and the phone was undamaged in any material way.

768
00:51:32,455 --> 00:51:34,040
Rym: This phone is actually invincible.

769
00:51:35,281 --> 00:51:41,540
Rym: And but again because it still works I'm not going to push that or test it and I'm definitely not gonna test it with the new phone.

770
00:51:41,861 --> 00:51:48,156
Rym: But arguably the new phone with its metal case or as miss metal top bits is actually probably more resilient.

771
00:51:48,176 --> 00:51:55,340
Rym: I Feel like if you if you made a phone and you marketed it as not needing a case it is that strong.

772
00:51:55,944 --> 00:51:57,876
Rym: I feel like that iPhone doesn't need a case.

773
00:51:57,916 --> 00:51:58,500
Scott: It is that strong.

774
00:51:59,541 --> 00:52:00,686
Scott: Don't just don't be.

775
00:52:00,726 --> 00:52:02,654
Rym: why do I see so many cracked iPhone?

776
00:52:02,674 --> 00:52:04,040
Scott: because people are fucking clumsy.

777
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:04,542
Scott: Well, how come?

778
00:52:04,582 --> 00:52:10,230
Rym: mine isn't except for the one time I fell yeah, but I'm saying make a phone where even if you're clumsy It doesn't break.

779
00:52:11,264 --> 00:52:12,153
Scott: Don't be a clumsy oaf.

780
00:52:14,163 --> 00:52:17,927
Rym: But like dynamite I Mean I'm not.

781
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:18,739
Rym: I don't break phones.

782
00:52:19,664 --> 00:52:20,915
Scott: I mean take care of your shit.

783
00:52:20,956 --> 00:52:28,857
Scott: be careful Don't like grease up your hands and use your phone with one hand while you're biking and not even looking at the road and you know doing stupid shit.

784
00:52:30,275 --> 00:52:32,250
Scott: Just Hold on to it tight.

785
00:52:32,532 --> 00:52:33,640
Rym: My Nexus 4 broke.

786
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,186
Rym: I remember literally I was.

787
00:52:35,306 --> 00:52:40,980
Rym: it was in my pocket and I was just sitting at a desk and I hung my jacket on the Door and it was in my pocket of a jacket.

788
00:52:41,321 --> 00:52:45,396
Rym: I was typing on the computer doing something and I just heard this sound like glass shattering like what.

789
00:52:45,818 --> 00:52:46,340
Rym: what was that?

790
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:47,223
Rym: Whatever?

791
00:52:47,243 --> 00:52:49,120
Rym: and I ignored it and then I went to go to bed.

792
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:53,979
Rym: I went to get my phone to charge it and the screen had just shattered on its own.

793
00:52:54,367 --> 00:52:59,232
Rym: Uh-huh Well, the ray I I'm pretty sure there's just a defect and it had been.

794
00:52:59,272 --> 00:53:01,600
Scott: it had to knock back the Rym breaking things on purpose.

795
00:53:02,101 --> 00:53:03,286
Rym: Why would I that Nexus 4?

796
00:53:03,286 --> 00:53:04,109
Rym: I loved I didn't.

797
00:53:04,369 --> 00:53:13,202
Rym: in fact when that phone broke was a terrible time to upgrade I ended up buying a really suboptimal Nexus 5 in London because I was really in a hurry to have a working phone again Mm-hmm.

798
00:53:14,327 --> 00:53:15,734
Rym: I think I gave that Nexus 5 away though.

799
00:53:15,995 --> 00:53:16,900
Rym: That one still kind of works.

800
00:53:18,221 --> 00:53:21,096
Rym: Yeah, smartphones are an interesting space and I'm hungry.

801
00:53:21,116 --> 00:53:21,880
