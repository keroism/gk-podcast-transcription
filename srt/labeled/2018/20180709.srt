00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,568
Rym: It's Monday July 9th 2018.

2
00:00:11,568 --> 00:00:14,836
Rym: I'm Rym, I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:15,257 --> 00:00:16,440
Rym: micro services.

4
00:00:18,642 --> 00:00:19,658
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,721 --> 00:00:32,192
Scott: So, you know bike at home like you do like you do the source of all opening bits the bike home Yep, in the subway ride home in the summer.

6
00:00:32,272 --> 00:00:41,340
Scott: It's us traveling through the city and in the winter It's me skiing and because I live at the center of the universe I bike past the United Nations on the way home Which is often a problem.

7
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:51,366
Scott: So, you know is that like they really need to make a bike path behind the UN they're gonna event 2030 whatever anyway And I passed by.

8
00:00:51,386 --> 00:00:56,834
Scott: you know, there's the Japan Society and there's the park across the street But one of the nice places you can hang out there.

9
00:00:56,895 --> 00:00:57,498
Scott: Well, what's her name?

10
00:00:59,060 --> 00:00:59,201
Rym: That's.

11
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:00,547
Rym: I know that I know the place you're talking about.

12
00:01:00,688 --> 00:01:01,170
Scott: What's her name?

13
00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:06,330
Scott: I can't remember her name the actress Hepburn, there's the Hepburn Park with the flowers.

14
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:12,595
Scott: You can walk through anyway, so That particular spot next to that little outdoor snacky restaurant place.

15
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:14,060
Rym: There's usually people protesting.

16
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:15,685
Scott: There's usually people protesting there.

17
00:01:15,745 --> 00:01:18,755
Rym: It's usually anti following or it's pro Falun Gong.

18
00:01:18,855 --> 00:01:20,683
Scott: No, I haven't seen them in all year Really?

19
00:01:20,823 --> 00:01:23,280
Rym: No, so I haven't biked past there yet this year.

20
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:23,922
Scott: Okay, but

21
00:01:23,962 --> 00:01:25,789
Rym: last year was always that fellow my

22
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:38,140
Scott: favorite guy that I see who I didn't haven't seen in a few weeks I've only seen him maybe three times and that was like last month is a Very Orthodox Jew guy who is protesting against Israel because they are doing inhuman things to Palestinian people.

23
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:39,164
Scott: That's my guy.

24
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,729
Rym: I'm with them.

25
00:01:41,171 --> 00:01:43,580
Scott: I saw some people protesting something last week.

26
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,177
Scott: I didn't know if it was you know, what they were doing was good or bad.

27
00:01:47,197 --> 00:01:47,659
Scott: I couldn't tell.

28
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:51,240
Scott: Yeah, it was in some other language and I don't know enough about it.

29
00:01:51,521 --> 00:02:00,994
Rym: I have multiple times just recently like in the last couple years run into protests in the city where I Can't tell if they're for or anti whatever like scub like whatever.

30
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:02,540
Rym: I don't know what their position is.

31
00:02:02,843 --> 00:02:04,380
Rym: I know they care about scub, but I cannot.

32
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:16,000
Scott: So not at the UN but last week outside of your apartment building because the yeah The Ecuadorian consulate is right outside Rym's apartment and there are people protesting and I figured out what they're protesting.

33
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:23,580
Scott: All right, the former president of Ecuador Correa, right was arrested or was at least I think a court ordered his arrest.

34
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:38,260
Scott: I don't know if he was actually arrested yet but a court ordered his arrest because they were claiming he was involved with a failed kidnapping of an Political opponent and I don't know if Correa was a good guy or a bad guy or if he kidnapped anyone or not.

35
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,839
Scott: So, I don't know which side of this is right.

36
00:02:40,482 --> 00:02:43,310
Scott: But the people who were protesting outside they were.

37
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,957
Scott: they had signs that were like I am Correa.

38
00:02:45,997 --> 00:02:46,900
Scott: They were pro-correa.

39
00:02:47,904 --> 00:02:53,708
Scott: They were upset that he was being attacked by the current Government of Ecuador in some way.

40
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:57,820
Scott: but today outside the UN was a very easy to understand protest.

41
00:02:58,001 --> 00:03:01,070
Scott: It was a pro-immigrant stop locking up children protests.

42
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:04,000
Scott: All right, and as I'm biking past I give them a high low.

43
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,404
Scott: Bring my bow ding ding ding.

44
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:06,246
Rym: Yeah.

45
00:03:06,346 --> 00:03:11,320
Scott: Yeah, I keep going and I'm just biking and behind the guy biking behind me.

46
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,130
Scott: So it's a guy.

47
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,238
Scott: Oh progressive enough to bike.

48
00:03:15,181 --> 00:03:19,000
Rym: I'm assuming that the where this story is going is that this dude is a piece of shit.

49
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:20,406
Scott: It is a piece of shit.

50
00:03:20,606 --> 00:03:21,952
Rym: All right, does he punch him in the dick?

51
00:03:22,274 --> 00:03:23,700
Scott: No, okay, I was bike.

52
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:26,206
Scott: I feel like punching someone.

53
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:26,528
Scott: I was.

54
00:03:26,688 --> 00:03:30,632
Scott: I tried to goad him into punching me in the dick hoping then he would end up in Jail, but that did not happen.

55
00:03:30,855 --> 00:03:30,997
Scott: anyway.

56
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:34,205
Scott: He just I hear behind me.

57
00:03:34,225 --> 00:03:39,420
Scott: Yeah, why don't you come here legally and I say hey Wow shut the fuck up asshole.

58
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:42,798
Scott: Yeah, you know I should take your children lock him up.

59
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:45,069
Scott: Concentration camp right.

60
00:03:45,712 --> 00:03:47,540
Scott: so, you know, we're just doing some yelling.

61
00:03:47,842 --> 00:03:50,559
Scott: But then here's the part where I failed.

62
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:58,271
Rym: yet I also learned because I remember my similar story where I told that Nazi guy shut up Because basically I'm busy biking right on First Avenue.

63
00:03:58,451 --> 00:04:00,358
Scott: try most of my concentration is on.

64
00:04:00,418 --> 00:04:04,936
Rym: don't die Right up and first Avenue ain't the most dangerous, but it ain't that low.

65
00:04:04,976 --> 00:04:05,740
Scott: We're in a bike lane.

66
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,348
Scott: Anyway, my concentration is on.

67
00:04:07,368 --> 00:04:07,770
Scott: don't die.

68
00:04:07,851 --> 00:04:11,248
Scott: First of all, right from cars Not from this guy.

69
00:04:11,268 --> 00:04:19,040
Scott: I'm not worried about this guy killing me and Basically, you know, he his argument was right.

70
00:04:19,402 --> 00:04:22,539
Scott: He was obviously skilled in these the art of street arguing.

71
00:04:26,984 --> 00:04:29,719
Scott: He said do you leave your doors unlocked at night?

72
00:04:30,261 --> 00:04:31,987
Scott: Right trying to imply that?

73
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:36,020
Scott: uh letting people into America from other countries is like leaving our doors on.

74
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:45,247
Rym: No what really amazes me the most about these piece of shit people is that it's like they all go to the same website and Memorize like the same six talking.

75
00:04:45,347 --> 00:04:49,700
Scott: So since I'm just trying not to die my I just yell some things like let them all in.

76
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,727
Scott: I don't believe in countries.

77
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:52,116
Scott: Yeah, you want to go over to my apartment.

78
00:04:52,137 --> 00:04:52,620
Rym: I'm like this.

79
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,588
Scott: I've learned that's the right way to go because I'm like, I'm like, oh you're I'm sure your grandparents They're from America.

80
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:04,720
Rym: you Native American, bro You know that kind of realize long ago that pretty much anyone who has this kind of opinion is already beyond reason debate.

81
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:08,720
Rym: So you might as well just double down on a position that's abhorrent to them and go.

82
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:18,399
Scott: This guy did not continue Following me to continue the argument and it's a good thing He did not because when I was on the bridge, of course, then you think of the best rebuttal.

83
00:05:18,621 --> 00:05:19,959
Scott: No when you're on the bridge.

84
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:27,600
Scott: So if anyone encounters anyone who uses the argument do when you're talking about immigration of do you leave your doors?

85
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,013
Scott: Locked at night if anyone uses that argument.

86
00:05:30,234 --> 00:05:31,240
Scott: Here's what you say, right?

87
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,170
Scott: Here's what you say.

88
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:39,920
Scott: you say yes But if someone knocks on my door Because they're the victim of domestic violence and they need help and you're trying to rescue them you open the fucking door.

89
00:05:40,161 --> 00:05:41,265
Scott: Yeah, that's your argument.

90
00:05:41,325 --> 00:05:52,007
Scott: Yeah, so if anybody runs into that asshole making the same argument now You can say that right away and not think of it when you're on the bridge and the assholes far gone Considering where that asshole roams.

91
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:54,916
Rym: I feel like we're both likely to encounter him again.

92
00:05:55,177 --> 00:05:56,422
Rym: I might encounter him I don't.

93
00:05:56,442 --> 00:05:59,259
Scott: I didn't really look at him cuz he's behind me and he didn't catch up.

94
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:07,791
Rym: Can only catch me with his yell that that Nazi piece-of-shit guy that I yelled at a while ago Never saw him again after the cops showed up.

95
00:06:07,912 --> 00:06:09,560
Scott: Oh, so also a side story.

96
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:15,500
Scott: I saw a tweet of a photo from anime Expo of a Deadpool Nazi cosplay.

97
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:18,950
Scott: Why is there no video of Deadpool Nazi being punched?

98
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:20,676
Scott: Yeah, this is a problem.

99
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:23,329
Scott: anime Expo get your shit together At least kick him out.

100
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:24,598
Scott: I don't fucking know.

101
00:06:25,496 --> 00:06:35,233
Scott: But If you are wearing a day a Nazi cosplay at a convention that I go to right You are not going to be punched by me and everyone.

102
00:06:35,274 --> 00:06:36,480
Scott: I know who's at the convention.

103
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:37,244
Scott: I mean, I'm at.

104
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:39,496
Scott: I'll even punch you at PAX and get kicked out of packs.

105
00:06:39,617 --> 00:06:40,099
Rym: It'd be worth it.

106
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,026
Rym: Yeah, I would sacrifice that.

107
00:06:42,287 --> 00:06:49,220
Scott: so I guess even though one of the rules of packs is no punching and kicking But they're breaking the rule of don't harass anyone exact.

108
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,566
Scott: So it is okay to punch you kick.

109
00:06:50,586 --> 00:06:55,845
Rym: more importantly one could argue that the advocacy of far-right positions Is effectively violent.

110
00:06:55,865 --> 00:07:00,658
Scott: I'm sure packs will love to when there is a video of an enforcer punching the lights out of a Nazi.

111
00:07:00,758 --> 00:07:06,885
Scott: Yeah I'm just very Attempting to impossible failing.

112
00:07:07,186 --> 00:07:08,069
Rym: I'm very much.

113
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:12,705
Rym: Okay with the current stance of basically everyone reasonable I might like going.

114
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,027
Scott: I might.

115
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:15,320
Scott: I might go take my enforcer shirt off and then go punch them.

116
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:17,168
Rym: Yeah, that would pack doesn't get in trouble.

117
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:17,871
Rym: That was just our.

118
00:07:17,891 --> 00:07:19,720
Scott: take the enforcer shirt off and strangle them with it.

119
00:07:20,422 --> 00:07:23,900
Rym: Yeah Well, or you just you just make a note of him.

120
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,743
Rym: You'll see him around the counter.

121
00:07:24,763 --> 00:07:29,720
Scott: If anyone knows any defense lawyers that will let me go to court admit guilt and ask for nullification.

122
00:07:30,265 --> 00:07:31,919
Scott: Let me know their number because that's my plan.

123
00:07:32,515 --> 00:07:36,552
Rym: Yep Important point in the era where we have to fight fascists.

124
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:40,797
Rym: we used to talk about this a lot on GeekNights back in like 2006. bring it up again right now.

125
00:07:41,341 --> 00:07:42,545
Scott: Jury nullification.

126
00:07:42,565 --> 00:07:44,551
Scott: There's an episode on GeekNights about jury nullification.

127
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:47,140
Scott: that is probably stupid wrong and we are not lawyers.

128
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:53,537
Rym: However, if you have the opportunity to be on a jury Because I just got a jury questionnaire.

129
00:07:53,879 --> 00:08:05,352
Rym: Oh Because there are not you can fill it out online now and the Nazis are being bold If you happen to be on a case where someone punched a Nazi You're perfectly within your rights to just say not guilty.

130
00:08:05,392 --> 00:08:07,400
Scott: doesn't matter what the judges instructions are.

131
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:12,380
Scott: It doesn't matter if the person actually punched the Nazi in this video of it and you do know you're on a jury.

132
00:08:12,862 --> 00:08:15,780
Scott: Why would they send you into the room with the 12 angry people?

133
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,968
Scott: Yep, all right to deliberate.

134
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:22,740
Scott: if the evidence and everything is beyond a reasonable doubt Why would they still send you into that room?

135
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,900
Scott: It's because you have the right as a juror to say guilty or not guilty as you fucking please.

136
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:38,498
Scott: so if somebody just you do the video of someone just mowing down a KKK rally with an assault rifle and you can see that they didn't murder any innocence Then you can say not guilty whatever the fuck.

137
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:42,453
Rym: Yep Now what you can't eat really do is say why you said not guilty.

138
00:08:42,754 --> 00:08:44,520
Scott: just say just go be on the jury.

139
00:08:45,082 --> 00:08:53,778
Scott: And then when it comes to just sit there quietly and watch the case and then when it comes time to be on the jury Go into the other room and say not guilty and maybe you'll hang them the jury.

140
00:08:53,878 --> 00:08:58,906
Scott: Not the Hang them - The only salute cure for Nazism.

141
00:08:58,926 --> 00:09:00,713
Scott: We know it worked one time.

142
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,854
Rym: so in news that's less fascist related, uh-huh, you might have noticed that.

143
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:14,019
Rym: so Europe has a lot of pros like generally European government is better than our American government, etc.

144
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:18,170
Rym: Kinda the one thing has always been in some ways.

145
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:25,880
Scott: Yeah, but if I had to choose between the internet and healthcare But anyway, it's not the EU that gives people health care.

146
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:32,207
Rym: Yeah, but every and every individual European state does it to a better degree than us, but I digress I don't know me.

147
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:32,972
Scott: There's a lot of them me.

148
00:09:33,013 --> 00:09:33,758
Scott: I don't know about all of them.

149
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,096
Scott: I mean, it's probable but I can't definitively say that.

150
00:09:38,217 --> 00:09:38,840
Rym: Yeah our health care.

151
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,420
Scott: I don't know about the health care systems of every single European nation.

152
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:50,408
Rym: But I can only say this the one thing that all European nations and the EU have been bad at for as long as I've been Alive is regulating the internet.

153
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:50,890
Rym: Mm-hmm.

154
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:52,095
Scott: Well, this is not theirs.

155
00:09:52,135 --> 00:09:53,420
Scott: That's why they want to mess with it, right?

156
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:53,861
Scott: They were all.

157
00:09:53,901 --> 00:09:57,617
Scott: they constantly want to bring in American tech companies and beat them up because they're trying to.

158
00:09:57,637 --> 00:10:04,520
Scott: that's the way they can attack America economically and The vast majority of the time they didn't invent the internet.

159
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,796
Rym: But European legislation and regulation around the internet tends to be really really bad.

160
00:10:10,263 --> 00:10:12,960
Rym: Yeah, really poorly designed has lots of adverse consequences.

161
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:18,320
Scott: Well, that's because the internet was actually made with you know American sensibilities right earlier.

162
00:10:19,623 --> 00:10:23,260
Scott: Well, even even cart internet was is architecturally American.

163
00:10:23,441 --> 00:10:33,700
Scott: Yeah, it's it's designed around, you know freedom of speech and such and such at least for now, which is turning into corporate Except in China where they built a digital wall.

164
00:10:34,462 --> 00:10:39,319
Rym: But if you didn't notice this is the kind of thing we would have talked about a lot more on GeekNights a decade ago.

165
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:54,340
Rym: But there was basically this European copyright law that was going through like the European Parliament and basically this law Was utterly ridiculous and most people have framed it phrased it as this would literally ban memes forever

166
00:10:54,642 --> 00:10:54,863
Scott: Yep,

167
00:10:55,246 --> 00:11:03,740
Rym: and it basically required ridiculous overbearing pre-filtering of content like to the point that the GeekNights forum.

168
00:11:04,403 --> 00:11:07,980
Rym: We would probably have had to say that no one from Europe is allowed to visit our forum.

169
00:11:08,321 --> 00:11:10,751
Scott: Okay, or in the very least we don't even have the cookie warning.

170
00:11:11,092 --> 00:11:11,775
Rym: No, we don't we're not.

171
00:11:11,935 --> 00:11:13,140
Rym: we're not GDPR compliant.

172
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,105
Scott: I'm not doing fucking shit.

173
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:19,660
Scott: I'm just using the software for the forum as it's delivered auto updating it and that's it.

174
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,220
Rym: Yeah, we have no presence in Europe and we never will unless we flee this country.

175
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,387
Scott: My server is not in Europe.

176
00:11:24,507 --> 00:11:26,700
Scott: European people visit our site and that's okay.

177
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,858
Rym: But if you're European visiting our site and it turns out that our site is illegal.

178
00:11:30,878 --> 00:11:32,504
Scott: That's on you I will obey.

179
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:35,536
Scott: I will keep the website and all of our technology in the country.

180
00:11:35,898 --> 00:11:41,179
Scott: That is most I guess convenient And that is where it always shall be.

181
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:46,180
Rym: So the reason I'm talking about this today is because you'll notice that I have two articles here.

182
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:54,941
Rym: They're the exact same image And one of them is new EU copyright filtering law threatens the internet as we know it from June 19th Mm-hmm.

183
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:55,685
Rym: Let's fast forward.

184
00:11:55,766 --> 00:12:02,432
Rym: less than a month to three days ago EU sends controversial internet copyright reform back to the drawing board.

185
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:04,840
Rym: good for the first goddamn time ever.

186
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:08,960
Rym: They actually voted no on one of these ridiculous internet law.

187
00:12:09,101 --> 00:12:14,440
Scott: There was I think a big push in the EU and also by even European tech companies against this.

188
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:21,794
Scott: so I looked into it a little more and it seems like sort of how we managed to make some sort of push against the CBD tPA type things.

189
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:34,160
Scott: Yep, or so tPA and I saw exactly what it stands surface and the pippas and all those things We all managed to defeat every time somehow except net neutrality, which we couldn't defeat because that wasn't a matter of Congress.

190
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:43,020
Scott: Yep, but it's easy because all those times that we beat those things in the US It was a matter of making Congress not do something which is surprisingly easy.

191
00:12:43,381 --> 00:12:48,000
Scott: But now in order to fix net neutrality, we have to make Congress do something and that is very difficult.

192
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:52,220
Rym: So basically this was at least temporarily shot down.

193
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:58,959
Rym: So if it comes back and left to come back in a very different form best I can tell tech companies were pretty much entirely against it.

194
00:13:00,406 --> 00:13:12,599
Rym: The general populace once they heard about it were generally against it and the only people I can seem to find that are for it are major content producers like publishing firms.

195
00:13:12,952 --> 00:13:20,187
Rym: Yeah But specifically there's all these articles that seem like they're astroturfed that are basically What was it?

196
00:13:20,207 --> 00:13:30,087
Rym: I found one specific one this article it was The National Book Council is Really really mad that this failed.

197
00:13:30,107 --> 00:13:37,632
Rym: Mmm, and I can't real they don't make an argument as to how this one I guess the National Silent Film Council is upset too.

198
00:13:38,054 --> 00:13:49,120
Rym: Yep, perhaps the Their article is making the rounds as unsuccessful EU copyright vote inflicted irreparable damage.

199
00:13:49,502 --> 00:13:53,560
Scott: You're not any worse than you were and using the argument that they make for getting rid of net neutrality.

200
00:13:53,661 --> 00:13:55,311
Scott: You're not any worse off than you were yesterday.

201
00:13:55,632 --> 00:14:02,440
Rym: Yep, but We actually won one in Europe and I'm kind of happy about that for now because we do their needs.

202
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,707
Scott: I'll probably edit it and bring it back.

203
00:14:03,888 --> 00:14:16,920
Rym: there needs to be massive copyright reform But this law in particular would have made basic things that any layperson using the internet expects to be able to do Owners to the point that they just would not happen in Europe.

204
00:14:18,064 --> 00:14:33,779
Rym: Hmm, and I think a big part of how this was shot down was that this is one of the first times that like even GDPR a lot of Western tech companies the smaller ones cut off their Service in Europe or shut down services, but the big ones generally complied with it.

205
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:40,804
Rym: Hmm the big ones in this case seemed to be implying that they would just literally cut off Europe rather than Comply with this ridiculous lies.

206
00:14:40,824 --> 00:14:41,767
Scott: Here's the news ready.

207
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,696
Scott: So valve the steam valve, right?

208
00:14:44,756 --> 00:14:52,097
Scott: It's not a gaming news the tech news Right, so, you know on the if you go on steam There's a little chart that shows you like current remote game with the most players right now.

209
00:14:52,137 --> 00:14:57,040
Scott: stuff like that Right, and they used to be steam spy which used the steam API to get various data about games.

210
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,009
Scott: That was invaluable, especially to developers to see what was popular.

211
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:00,391
Scott: Oh god.

212
00:15:00,631 --> 00:15:03,320
Rym: I suddenly remember I found I was looking for slides for a panel.

213
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,830
Rym: I'm gonna write for packs and I found an old panel.

214
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:06,231
Rym: we did.

215
00:15:06,513 --> 00:15:10,796
Rym: we have all these screenshots of Player like the top ten games on steam.

216
00:15:10,816 --> 00:15:14,089
Rym: Those are so old I know because it was literally counter-strike.

217
00:15:14,109 --> 00:15:16,698
Rym: go counter-strike one six for number one and number two.

218
00:15:16,878 --> 00:15:18,558
Scott: Not anymore It's still up there though.

219
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:29,060
Scott: Anyway, so because if you don't know recently like maybe months ago Valve got rid of the API's that use steam spy and I think there were rumors they were gonna do something different.

220
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:30,856
Scott: They were trying to protect privacy or something.

221
00:15:30,917 --> 00:15:31,240
Scott: I don't know.

222
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:37,400
Scott: There's a brute brouhaha, but people are upset because now steam spy will be much less accurate or perhaps so inaccurate.

223
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,800
Scott: It's useless or whatever.

224
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:44,760
Scott: So you can't get accurate data now about which games are selling how much if you're just like a developer?

225
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,920
Scott: Who's gonna do market research or stuff like that, right?

226
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:53,160
Scott: I'm sure the big players are still paying market research firms to get that kind of info but little indie devs don't know anymore.

227
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:53,724
Scott: Yeah, I need.

228
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,771
Scott: they needed steam spy.

229
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:55,718
Scott: It was valuable to them.

230
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,719
Scott: Anyway, so here's a new news.

231
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:13,680
Scott: Somebody went on the steam API and it tells you in the steam API to a show or at least it did until just now It tells you to an extremely precise degree as in 16 decimal places.

232
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,555
Rym: I want to point out that is way more than almost anything.

233
00:16:17,695 --> 00:16:20,680
Rym: I interact with in Wall Street, that's right.

234
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:23,169
Scott: It tells you it did at least until recently.

235
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:30,900
Scott: tell you to 16 decimal place accuracy How many players of the game have achieved a particular achievement?

236
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:40,146
Scott: So you could look at any game on Steam that has achievements and you can say oh, here's this really hard achievement Like beat the game and it'll say X dot dah, dah, dah, dah.

237
00:16:40,146 --> 00:16:41,068
Scott: 16 places.

238
00:16:41,308 --> 00:16:44,778
Scott: percent of players have Reached that beat in the game.

239
00:16:45,643 --> 00:16:47,490
Scott: You look at that number and you say well, wait a minute.

240
00:16:48,052 --> 00:16:52,851
Scott: the number of people who bought the game Right must be an integer.

241
00:16:53,272 --> 00:16:53,854
Scott: It must be.

242
00:16:54,457 --> 00:16:57,767
Scott: it cannot be a non It can't sell half a can't be.

243
00:16:57,928 --> 00:16:58,831
Scott: it can't be negative.

244
00:16:59,051 --> 00:16:59,894
Scott: It can't be zero.

245
00:17:00,536 --> 00:17:01,900
Scott: It cannot be a fraction.

246
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:16,540
Scott: it must be a positive integer, right and Therefore we can deduce right by looking at this very very precise percentage and just sort of doing some math and also accounting for you know The way computers calculate floating-point numbers you got.

247
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,195
Scott: maybe got to add one or subtract one or you know One decimal place at the end or something.

248
00:17:20,215 --> 00:17:20,498
Rym: Oh my god.

249
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:25,536
Rym: I love a Counter-Strike go and Counter-Strike source Right are still there.

250
00:17:25,556 --> 00:17:31,934
Scott: so you can tell by extrapolating from those percentages What is that number like?

251
00:17:31,994 --> 00:17:34,180
Scott: how many total people got that achievement?

252
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:39,234
Scott: because you just keep saying well if this is the percentage what integers Would there be?

253
00:17:39,555 --> 00:17:44,309
Scott: this percentage of that would break evenly because you know, the number of people who achieved it must also be integer, right?

254
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:45,820
Rym: So it's like right.

255
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:53,350
Scott: It's like what pot what big integer divided by what smaller integer will equal this nut or what bigger in it right equal this number?

256
00:17:53,883 --> 00:18:06,264
Scott: so Then from that you can say well if that's eight percent of this total people who bought the game then the number of total people who bought the game is X. and you get a shockingly accurate number of people who owned the game at the time that the person did this.

257
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:13,009
Scott: and as soon as they Collected all the info and all the top games on Steam and published it then valve removed this info from steam.

258
00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:16,066
Scott: But we have the info which is what's important.

259
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:19,470
Rym: but bear in mind This is not saying how many people are playing the game.

260
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:23,409
Scott: No, it's how many people have owned the game and have it in their steam account.

261
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:26,910
Rym: So yeah, 50 million people own Team Fortress 2, right?

262
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:30,324
Scott: You've got to take into account that a lot of these games are like free games.

263
00:18:30,746 --> 00:18:37,165
Scott: You've also got to take into account There's only counts games with achievements games that don't have achievements aren't counted at all because there's no info.

264
00:18:37,546 --> 00:18:43,876
Scott: and also notice like one Of the biggest games on Steam which is Dota 2 is not even there Right, which is I don't know.

265
00:18:43,896 --> 00:18:45,462
Scott: does Dota 2 not have achievements on Steam?

266
00:18:45,483 --> 00:18:47,350
Rym: I have no idea why Dota 2 wouldn't be there.

267
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,235
Scott: Yeah, so there's there's.

268
00:18:48,316 --> 00:18:57,831
Scott: there's a lot of ifs and ands and whatnot but once you even with all those sort of you know ifs I guess and Whatever.

269
00:18:58,132 --> 00:19:00,218
Scott: This is still shockingly accurate if you're interested.

270
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,730
Scott: I find it interesting that Slay the Spire and NecroDancer are like right next to each other.

271
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:11,215
Rym: Yeah, well there I feel like they target the exact same demographic and I feel like we should just look at games with that number Of sales figures.

272
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,603
Scott: Yeah, like those.

273
00:19:12,643 --> 00:19:13,789
Scott: that's where the good games are gonna be.

274
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:25,830
Rym: But I guess the the interesting part of this from a Monday perspective is when you're doing data security Micro services, you know all the techie stuff we do and you're worried about data leakage.

275
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:34,290
Scott: Metadata can leak very complex information without you realizing you can figure one thing out from another thing.

276
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,778
Scott: Yeah, right, you know.

277
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:41,950
Scott: or even if you can't completely figure out This is a case where you can almost completely figure out one thing from a seemingly unrelated thing.

278
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:46,646
Scott: But there are times where it's like you can just guess and be very accurate if people know.

279
00:19:46,747 --> 00:19:53,010
Scott: it's like for example Everyone knows the percentage of English names on average that start with whatever whatever letter.

280
00:19:53,511 --> 00:19:57,960
Scott: So it's like you can sort of get really good guesses about things like public information like that.

281
00:20:05,874 --> 00:20:09,629
Rym: So we learned a decent amount about Ned Kelly some time ago, I don't know who that is.

282
00:20:11,591 --> 00:20:16,770
Rym: We've talked about Ned Kelly multiple times on GeekNights, why would I remember that you have no idea who Ned Kelly is?

283
00:20:16,991 --> 00:20:19,180
Scott: I mean, I probably will as soon as you start saying who it is.

284
00:20:19,481 --> 00:20:21,590
Rym: So I will say I'll give you a clue.

285
00:20:22,111 --> 00:20:25,099
Rym: He is orthogonally distantly related to far.

286
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,023
Scott: lap The horse.

287
00:20:27,324 --> 00:20:28,911
Scott: yeah, Ned Kelly's a horse.

288
00:20:29,172 --> 00:20:31,240
Scott: No Ned Kelly's a person who rides a horse.

289
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,689
Scott: Technically Ned Kelly is the Australian gangster guy.

290
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,158
Rym: Ned Kelly is the Australian weeaboo gangster.

291
00:20:38,318 --> 00:20:38,760
Scott: That's right.

292
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,672
Scott: So I remember now we do.

293
00:20:40,712 --> 00:20:46,107
Rym: we went to a Ned Kelly Museum And we saw his fucking armor.

294
00:20:46,148 --> 00:20:49,379
Rym: I remember who it is now the guy who made the armor that guy.

295
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:50,537
Scott: yes I know who it is now.

296
00:20:50,961 --> 00:20:59,474
Rym: So even then I really only had a superficial understanding and basically in my mind He was just like an Australian Billy the Kid.

297
00:20:59,494 --> 00:21:05,600
Scott: All I remember about him is yeah He's like a. he's like a you know, a Western gangster who was a weeaboo who had armor in Australia.

298
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:12,214
Scott: The weeaboo part is very important and very hilarious But he was much closer, you know, you could to be a weeaboo in those days.

299
00:21:12,234 --> 00:21:13,820
Scott: You had to live much closer to Japan.

300
00:21:18,841 --> 00:21:20,646
Rym: but I Pretty good show on history.

301
00:21:20,686 --> 00:21:27,956
Rym: They did a good one on Catherine the Great and I watched these occasionally But I never noticed that they have one on Ned Kelly and it goes into.

302
00:21:27,976 --> 00:21:28,879
Scott: are you sure it's accurate?

303
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:30,419
Rym: Yes It looks pretty accurate.

304
00:21:31,341 --> 00:21:35,924
Scott: Please go to like a prison where they kept Ned Kelly or like Fucking museum.

305
00:21:35,944 --> 00:21:37,208
Scott: I had his gold or something there.

306
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:38,734
Rym: We saw like I remember.

307
00:21:38,915 --> 00:21:40,200
Rym: we learned a lot about Ned Kelly.

308
00:21:40,864 --> 00:21:43,100
Scott: I'm well forgot most a legend of Curly's gold.

309
00:21:43,243 --> 00:21:43,999
Scott: I forgot most of it.

310
00:21:44,941 --> 00:21:52,308
Rym: This video series is fascinating because I the one thing I mistook is I thought Ned Kelly Was in it for the money.

311
00:21:52,689 --> 00:21:54,315
Scott: No, he was in it for the weeb.

312
00:21:54,616 --> 00:21:55,500
Rym: He was in it for revenge.

313
00:21:56,404 --> 00:21:57,138
Scott: revenge against who?

314
00:21:58,366 --> 00:22:05,636
Rym: It's complicated Basically against the squatters and as far I don't know a lot about Australian history because it's not doesn't really.

315
00:22:05,656 --> 00:22:11,820
Rym: it's not relevant to my life but Basically as best I can tell I'm probably really wrong about this.

316
00:22:12,361 --> 00:22:15,408
Rym: The squatters were basically this like land-owning gentry.

317
00:22:15,428 --> 00:22:18,475
Rym: They were the McCoy's that like squatters like he was a Hatfield.

318
00:22:18,495 --> 00:22:24,408
Scott: He was a Basically, he was a sovereign citizen.

319
00:22:24,589 --> 00:22:27,359
Rym: He was a present a peasant farmer who got fucked over by the squatters.

320
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:33,420
Rym: He was dedicated the rest of his life to getting revenge on those squatters and the cops that were in their pay.

321
00:22:34,162 --> 00:22:37,011
Rym: Mm-hmm, so kind of good guy.

322
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:39,600
Rym: also a murderer didn't want to be a murderer.

323
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,298
Rym: The first copy shot kind of made him shoot him.

324
00:22:43,902 --> 00:22:47,180
Rym: It's just a really fascinating story and this will tell it to you in excruciating detail.

325
00:22:48,088 --> 00:22:48,553
Rym: So what do you got?

326
00:22:49,219 --> 00:22:53,138
Scott: Oh So they told you from What's happening right now?

327
00:22:54,887 --> 00:22:58,925
Scott: And it's not the easiest thing to watch Even though it's like.

328
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:09,375
Scott: I kind of want to care about bicycle racing because they care about bicycling but it's still so tainted with drugs and also still so Not that exciting to watch.

329
00:23:09,777 --> 00:23:12,465
Rym: most of the time I like to watch highlights.

330
00:23:12,746 --> 00:23:13,990
Scott: Yeah anyway.

331
00:23:15,198 --> 00:23:18,969
Scott: so In honor of that here is a video of it.

332
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:23,350
Scott: It's actually a series of like the most ex legendary cycling accidents.

333
00:23:24,054 --> 00:23:33,610
Scott: But this is the first in that series and basically this dude He's in first place during this race and he goes over the edge Oh boy, and it's like it's not the kind of cliff where it's straight down and he dies.

334
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,132
Scott: So it's not.

335
00:23:34,193 --> 00:23:35,720
Scott: it's not an unwatchable video.

336
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,986
Scott: It's not squeamish or anything.

337
00:23:37,126 --> 00:23:37,910
Rym: that guy's fine.

338
00:23:38,312 --> 00:23:41,090
Scott: I wouldn't post it if it was like that because I would also probably vomit.

339
00:23:42,871 --> 00:23:48,790
Scott: But he it's so steep though that he has a hard time crawling back up and his bike just keeps on.

340
00:23:49,672 --> 00:23:50,317
Rym: He starts sliding.

341
00:23:50,337 --> 00:23:51,465
Rym: You're like that doesn't look that steep?

342
00:23:51,485 --> 00:23:52,170
Rym: and then you see his bike.

343
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:06,104
Scott: Nobody's going down to get the bike so he has to wait for his replacement bike to come which is way in the back Which means he went to from first to Finishing like many minutes back.

344
00:24:06,205 --> 00:24:11,805
Scott: Yeah So there's like a legendary moment from the I guess the past.

345
00:24:11,886 --> 00:24:16,708
Scott: but if you go through the series There are many other bicycle accidents, but I can't guarantee that none of those are squeamish.

346
00:24:16,728 --> 00:24:19,719
Scott: So Continued is video number two at your own risk.

347
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,770
Rym: I guess bike sports are kind of for me.

348
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:25,439
Rym: They're kind of like baseball and that I like doing them.

349
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,927
Rym: don't really care about watching them.

350
00:24:28,048 --> 00:24:28,750
Scott: Yeah, like basketball.

351
00:24:29,072 --> 00:24:32,310
Scott: Yeah, also, you know bicycle racing is way scary.

352
00:24:32,551 --> 00:24:33,113
Scott: It's like.

353
00:24:33,354 --> 00:24:34,539
Scott: it's like bicycling is fine.

354
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,889
Scott: bicycle racing is gets closer to skiing which I don't do.

355
00:24:37,971 --> 00:24:38,494
Scott: These guys go.

356
00:24:38,655 --> 00:24:40,786
Scott: these guys are going 40 miles an hour if I get to 30.

357
00:24:40,786 --> 00:24:49,699
Rym: I'm like, oh The fastest I've ever gone on a bike at least based on my bike computer was About 48.

358
00:24:49,699 --> 00:24:50,081
Scott: Okay.

359
00:24:50,362 --> 00:24:54,589
Scott: That was when I was in high school I think I maybe got to 38 going down a hill and was like, oh shit.

360
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:55,312
Rym: So that was.

361
00:24:55,332 --> 00:25:18,336
Rym: we were in high school and I was like with my family doing this like Jeep Jamboree and we were going around doing like mountain biking and off-roading and all this nonsense and I just took my mountain bike and My family stopped the car because there was that we're gonna take an exit ramp that goes way down the mountain and I just rode down on my bike and my family caught up in the car and It was terrifying.

362
00:25:18,376 --> 00:25:20,705
Rym: I'm not gonna pretend it wasn't but I bike like.

363
00:25:20,765 --> 00:25:22,110
Rym: I bike pretty fast on a regular basis.

364
00:25:22,392 --> 00:25:27,710
Scott: I really got a fight to put some effort in maybe tonight and find this chart I saw once that showed the elevations of the Tour de France.

365
00:25:28,511 --> 00:25:29,655
Scott: And it's like you.

366
00:25:29,715 --> 00:25:30,819
Scott: it's like you bike.

367
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:35,113
Scott: we bike over hills here and it's like you over the Queensborough Bridge and it's like It's easy.

368
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:36,398
Scott: It's still it's a hill.

369
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:37,602
Scott: It's like you notice it right?

370
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:38,465
Rym: I slow down.

371
00:25:38,565 --> 00:25:39,890
Scott: Yeah, it's like it's a hill.

372
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,903
Scott: I gear down right these guys on the Tour de France.

373
00:25:42,923 --> 00:25:44,128
Scott: They wouldn't even know it's flat to them.

374
00:25:45,812 --> 00:25:50,350
Scott: They don't even notice that they their elevations that they climb to steep the grades that they go up.

375
00:25:50,851 --> 00:25:52,035
Scott: It's like the.

376
00:25:52,095 --> 00:25:56,990
Scott: the the bridge here would be like a speck like you would look flat compared to the the mountains They're climbing.

377
00:25:57,137 --> 00:25:57,409
Scott: That's it.

378
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:08,350
Rym: So and this is why they're all on fucking drugs because no human would be Poking at my Strava the other day because I noticed something I have like the hundredth best time ever going across the Queensborough Bridge.

379
00:26:08,711 --> 00:26:09,716
Rym: No, like anyone was Strava.

380
00:26:10,218 --> 00:26:12,970
Scott: Maybe I should did you like Huff and Puff and try it all the time.

381
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:13,649
Rym: Oh, okay.

382
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,100
Scott: So maybe I should Huff and Puff just one time to see.

383
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,344
Scott: if I can I could probably be you.

384
00:26:17,726 --> 00:26:19,273
Scott: so I don't have a puff One time.

385
00:26:19,293 --> 00:26:20,823
Scott: I don't think you could beat me one time.

386
00:26:20,863 --> 00:26:21,366
Scott: Huff and Puff.

387
00:26:21,386 --> 00:26:22,010
Rym: a better way to do it.

388
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:22,737
Rym: We should just race.

389
00:26:23,283 --> 00:26:23,849
Scott: that's dangerous.

390
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:26,461
Scott: It's I have to do it at night when no one's there.

391
00:26:26,481 --> 00:26:26,984
Rym: So yeah, we do.

392
00:26:27,025 --> 00:26:28,134
Rym: we do the race at night There's.

393
00:26:28,175 --> 00:26:28,928
Scott: no I have to do.

394
00:26:28,968 --> 00:26:32,070
Scott: no I just do it on myself and then you do it by yourself and then we look at the time.

395
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,038
Rym: I'm just go next to each other.

396
00:26:33,078 --> 00:26:34,046
Rym: No, that's dangerous.

397
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:36,074
Scott: So go Someone will fall over the edge.

398
00:26:36,255 --> 00:26:36,898
Rym: That is not.

399
00:26:37,018 --> 00:26:39,087
Rym: it's a straight bridge there at no point.

400
00:26:39,107 --> 00:26:39,650
Rym: Does it turn?

401
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,487
Scott: No, there is no way we could have an accident one at a time.

402
00:26:43,532 --> 00:26:52,635
Rym: Anyway, so I looked at what the difference was and the difference between like my set like top hundred and the top 20 Wasn't that much.

403
00:26:53,037 --> 00:27:01,350
Rym: but then I looked at the like the runs of all the top people, you know The difference is I go crazy fast on the downhill and pretty fast on the uphill.

404
00:27:01,791 --> 00:27:04,279
Rym: They're going the same goddamn speed up and down.

405
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,185
Scott: I could probably go up real fast.

406
00:27:06,205 --> 00:27:07,830
Scott: I actually probably be slow on the down.

407
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:11,490
Scott: I probably like fast on the up and slow on the job was the fact is going up.

408
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:12,596
Scott: I have no fear right?

409
00:27:12,656 --> 00:27:15,839
Scott: I could just put in the full huff and puff and then going down I hit the brakes.

410
00:27:15,879 --> 00:27:16,509
Scott: cuz I'm afraid.

411
00:27:17,452 --> 00:27:20,190
Rym: Yeah, I never hit the brakes down a lot of especially on the very end.

412
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:25,469
Scott: I wonder where it's like it wonder where Strava stops timing you right cuz like is that super steep part of the Manhattan side?

413
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,870
Scott: Where it's like you got to hit the brakes, but like when do I hit?

414
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:36,850
Rym: So if we're doing a race, we would definitely race into Queens Because the eggs the output of the bridge is a lot safer there, I think but that feels too easy.

415
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:40,450
Scott: It feels like the good race would be with a long uphill going out of Queens.

416
00:27:40,811 --> 00:27:43,585
Rym: Yeah, the problem is you gotta add both times together.

417
00:27:43,907 --> 00:27:47,927
Rym: We could do that Yeah, if we had to figure out which Strava route to use to track it.

418
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:49,112
Rym: detail I don't know.

419
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:50,438
Rym: or you just do it next to each other.

420
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:53,350
Scott: Maybe maybe you just have someone stand there with a stopwatch.

421
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,419
Scott: Yeah, oh wait.

422
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:56,404
Scott: We need two people.

423
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:57,710
Scott: I'm wait one on each side.

424
00:27:59,092 --> 00:28:01,446
Rym: We need we need all those all those side characters.

425
00:28:01,506 --> 00:28:05,181
Rym: initial D Or is standing there with the stopwatches and the walkie-talkies.

426
00:28:05,201 --> 00:28:06,766
Scott: I don't know we can do that.

427
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:11,285
Rym: We could live stream it Does have a boat mount our phones on our bikes and live stream our race.

428
00:28:11,527 --> 00:28:13,558
Scott: hmm That's what we could do.

429
00:28:13,598 --> 00:28:20,814
Scott: is you just put a GoPro on Ride and then you put the GoPro on and ride and then we can use the GoPro's to get perfect timing By comparing the video.

430
00:28:21,296 --> 00:28:25,770
Rym: that is possible, but that seems much more work than just biking up and over at the same time.

431
00:28:26,591 --> 00:28:27,173
Scott: That's dangerous.

432
00:28:27,294 --> 00:28:28,198
Rym: How is it dangerous?

433
00:28:28,378 --> 00:28:28,499
Rym: How?

434
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:30,146
Rym: it's not like you're gonna move left and right.

435
00:28:30,186 --> 00:28:31,090
Rym: you just take one line.

436
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,155
Scott: What if someone's coming at us?

437
00:28:32,939 --> 00:28:34,626
Rym: if we do it like 3 a.m.. No one's coming at us.

438
00:28:34,687 --> 00:28:35,350
Scott: someone will become it.

439
00:28:36,553 --> 00:28:41,239
Rym: Then we stationed someone at the other side of the bridge and They'll like toot a horn.

440
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:41,843
Scott: We'll get in trouble.

441
00:28:41,883 --> 00:28:42,286
Rym: It's coming.

442
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:42,810
Scott: We'll get in trouble.

443
00:28:44,713 --> 00:28:46,163
Rym: I think you're just afraid you're gonna lose real fast.

444
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:52,939
Rym: I Think the downhill is what would kill you though because that's where I get my most speed And I feel like you would touch your brakes.

445
00:28:53,181 --> 00:28:54,428
Rym: Oh definitely touch your brakes.

446
00:28:54,469 --> 00:28:54,670
Rym: It's over.

447
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:58,894
Scott: I never touch my brakes on a downhill, but even about when you're coming to the end You're gonna just crash into the wall.

448
00:28:59,035 --> 00:29:02,670
Rym: I just stopped really, but there's a reason why I keep popping spokes.

449
00:29:02,871 --> 00:29:03,956
Scott: Then your rear wheel will go.

450
00:29:03,996 --> 00:29:05,101
Scott: We need to go over the top.

451
00:29:05,804 --> 00:29:05,965
Rym: No.

452
00:29:06,005 --> 00:29:07,654
Rym: I don't touch my rear brake I'm.

453
00:29:07,674 --> 00:29:07,815
Scott: no.

454
00:29:07,835 --> 00:29:09,890
Scott: I'm saying if you hit your front brake your rear wheel would just go.

455
00:29:10,413 --> 00:29:14,402
Rym: Now I hit my front brake the right way and my rear wheel lifts up by about an inch And then I just come to a really fast.

456
00:29:14,422 --> 00:29:15,089
Scott: Yeah, that's too much.

457
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,787
Scott: I must accelerate and decelerate smoothly.

458
00:29:20,807 --> 00:29:23,820
Rym: I Very often let my rear wheel come off the ground.

459
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,705
Rym: That's how I stop.

460
00:29:24,946 --> 00:29:26,997
Scott: I do not do that I smooth I'm always smooth.

461
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:31,040
Rym: You know I think the real difference is it's not just like I'm not afraid I think it's literally just that.

462
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:32,530
Rym: I mountain bike my whole life.

463
00:29:32,591 --> 00:29:34,029
Rym: So I learned a very different kind of biking.

464
00:29:34,512 --> 00:29:35,174
Scott: I must.

465
00:29:35,194 --> 00:29:39,390
Scott: I also drive smooth and you drive you hit the brakes at the last second whereas I break them year in advance.

466
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,454
Scott: So it stops smooth.

467
00:29:41,016 --> 00:29:42,561
Scott: No we we gotta be smooth.

468
00:29:42,802 --> 00:29:44,046
Scott: We both know comfortable.

469
00:29:44,126 --> 00:29:57,030
Scott: No rapid accelerate See high velocity isn't really the problem It's rapid acceleration or deceleration is yeah on a bike accelerate as fast as possible Maybe if I use maybe if I get up to speed on the bike path and then get and then get on the bridge.

470
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,200
Scott: I'll already be going fast.

471
00:29:58,241 --> 00:29:59,270
Scott: I won't need to accelerate.

472
00:29:59,752 --> 00:30:00,475
Rym: Yeah, you think about that.

473
00:30:00,495 --> 00:30:04,070
Rym: the problem is that bridge has a u-turn to get on the uphill.

474
00:30:04,851 --> 00:30:07,886
Rym: Mmm got that hard u-turn to actually get to the uphill side a u-turn.

475
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:08,670
Scott: It's more like a chicane.

476
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:15,448
Rym: Yeah, you do a you you go around once like a s. I guess it's arguably a really long chicane.

477
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:20,354
Rym: anyway In the meta moment the book club book is The Odyssey.

478
00:30:20,615 --> 00:30:21,820
Scott: oh crap like.

479
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,326
Rym: I think we can finish it by Thursday.

480
00:30:23,366 --> 00:30:24,190
Scott: I'm gonna read it this weekend.

481
00:30:25,716 --> 00:30:27,048
Rym: If we miss it we'll have to do it.

482
00:30:27,651 --> 00:30:28,013
Rym: What should we?

483
00:30:28,334 --> 00:30:32,530
Rym: what should we do the Thursday show on if we don't finish the Odyssey the part we read already?

484
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,255
Scott: I read more than half.

485
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,665
Rym: we could do a Thursday show on reading.

486
00:30:38,726 --> 00:30:41,310
Rym: I Don't think we remember the show just reading.

487
00:30:42,111 --> 00:30:43,397
Scott: Every book club is about reading.

488
00:30:43,457 --> 00:30:46,872
Rym: yeah, but like favorite books least favorite books We already did.

489
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,359
Scott: all my favorite books is the book.

490
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:51,170
Scott: oh except for one I Got.

491
00:30:51,191 --> 00:30:52,655
Rym: so did we ever?

492
00:30:52,675 --> 00:30:55,243
Scott: maybe I should make my favorite book my second stone.

493
00:30:55,885 --> 00:30:56,688
Scott: no no certain.

494
00:30:56,708 --> 00:30:59,034
Scott: the stone isn't a book That's a Disney movie.

495
00:30:59,155 --> 00:31:02,590
Rym: Oh, yeah, but the book that the sword the stone is loosely but once in future King.

496
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,856
Scott: Yeah, no you don't want to read that.

497
00:31:04,117 --> 00:31:06,006
Rym: no I read it the last time.

498
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:06,870
Rym: I read it was ninth grade.

499
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:08,848
Scott: I read it also in the ninth grade.

500
00:31:08,889 --> 00:31:11,164
Rym: ish All right, what's your favorite book?

501
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:14,200
Rym: Just the prince of nothing again.

502
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,417
Scott: Oh I didn't think about that.

503
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:18,330
Rym: yeah, it's a problem anyway.

504
00:31:19,131 --> 00:31:21,063
Rym: Anyway, we'll probably do it soon.

505
00:31:21,124 --> 00:31:21,506
Rym: read the book.

506
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:21,828
Rym: It's good.

507
00:31:23,031 --> 00:31:27,530
Rym: We will unfortunately not be a ConnectiCon which is this coming weekend.

508
00:31:27,972 --> 00:31:29,418
Scott: Oh, oh well go to ConnectiCon.

509
00:31:29,438 --> 00:31:32,250
Scott: if you're anywhere near ConnectiCon it's probably still worth your time.

510
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,475
Scott: You can play mad board games there.

511
00:31:33,515 --> 00:31:37,270
Rym: yep, so if you didn't notice we we are no longer the heads of the panels department.

512
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,544
Rym: We just do not have time to deal with it.

513
00:31:39,584 --> 00:31:41,755
Scott: I don't want to go to kinetic I do.

514
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:52,806
Rym: I actually kind of wish I was going to ConnectiCon but this Weekend is the game developers of color conference in Manhattan which is also a very important connection that we will be doing.

515
00:31:52,826 --> 00:31:53,570
Scott: Schomburg Center.

516
00:31:53,671 --> 00:31:55,410
Scott: I'm gonna go there for like an hour or two in the afternoon.

517
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,595
Rym: Yep I will do the same cuz.

518
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:58,484
Scott: we went there last year and we saw some awesome games.

519
00:31:58,504 --> 00:31:59,630
Rym: there were real good games.

520
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:07,755
Rym: They're like the average quality of games at game devs of color is well above the average quality of games at most other indie game Conventions I've ever been to.

521
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,824
Scott: I agree like legit fact.

522
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,130
Scott: That's what I said, and you stole it from me.

523
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:19,530
Rym: Yeah, but I'm saying it again cuz it's it's shockingly true And that says a lot about the inherent problems in the game industry.

524
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:33,670
Rym: But Connecticut if you live nearby like if you can drive to Hartford, Connecticut Despite the fact that we are not there and thus there will probably be a learning curve year for the people who have taken over.

525
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:41,818
Scott: for us as happens in these situations you don't need to go to any panels just go and do the other stuff, but uh The con is a lot of stuff going on.

526
00:32:41,939 --> 00:32:44,970
Rym: it's a bigger gaming convention than most gaming conventions.

527
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:46,174
Scott: It's an everything con.

528
00:32:46,455 --> 00:32:48,923
Scott: It doesn't pretend to be a not everything con.

529
00:32:48,943 --> 00:32:50,287
Scott: It says we aren't everything con.

530
00:32:50,508 --> 00:32:52,394
Scott: They got sci-fi They got superheroes.

531
00:32:52,454 --> 00:32:53,438
Scott: They got animes.

532
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:55,746
Scott: They got every much everything nerdy.

533
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:56,890
Scott: They got it there.

534
00:32:57,111 --> 00:32:59,323
Scott: Yeah, if you're a nerdy person you will have a good time.

535
00:32:59,383 --> 00:33:00,510
Scott: You can play video games.

536
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,393
Scott: They got lands.

537
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:01,955
Scott: they get everything.

538
00:33:02,216 --> 00:33:12,448
Scott: and also I'm pretty sure whether you're whether you're a grognard who wants to play a war game Or a kid who wants to get hype on the furry parade or whatever is a good time Yep.

539
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:22,249
Rym: And also if you've all you hear us talking about conventions a lot and you want to like join a convention Pretty sure the department we left behind is gonna be needing chill people.

540
00:33:22,511 --> 00:33:34,415
Rym: Yeah, if you want to be a convention staff person and you live anywhere near, Connecticut Yep, especially if you want to be like you want to be a force or someday But you can't get to Paxis yet like and you live in Connecticut Connecticut will never sell out.

541
00:33:34,455 --> 00:33:43,288
Scott: you can go there real easy and this is a card where you could learn like how to staff because Full disclosure also, even if you just attend you get so much bonus shit for attending.

542
00:33:43,308 --> 00:33:45,377
Scott: hit icon There's like free movie screenings.

543
00:33:45,397 --> 00:33:48,549
Scott: Like yeah, like you actually Connecticut is actually a ridiculously good deal.

544
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:52,374
Scott: content wise yeah and Rest assured.

545
00:33:52,454 --> 00:33:58,544
Rym: There's a good chance gig knives will be returning to future Connecticut's to do panels Just not to be running the show anymore.

546
00:33:58,564 --> 00:34:04,278
Rym: closing one day Yeah, then I would easily go like sleeve like In the summer.

547
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:05,710
Scott: if it was in winter, I would not hesitate it.

548
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:07,030
Rym: Oh, but I'll probably do this.

549
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:13,210
Rym: I'll start doing the thing like a new zinc account where I roll in like Friday night Do the count all day Saturday and leave pretty early on Sunday.

550
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,966
Rym: So I get like the con experience but also still have my weekend.

551
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:20,045
Scott: Mmm It's not really worth it to go all the way to Hartford for just that unless I could do.

552
00:34:20,106 --> 00:34:20,850
Scott: maybe I visit my mommy.

553
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:22,594
Rym: Do it just for that.

554
00:34:22,975 --> 00:34:23,275
Rym: We'll see.

555
00:34:23,577 --> 00:34:28,829
Rym: also Connecticut is one of the only cons I can do some of the content All right, we got any other.

556
00:34:30,431 --> 00:34:34,647
Rym: Otherwise the next cons will be at are gonna be the real packs packs real.

557
00:34:34,967 --> 00:34:35,530
Scott: It's letting stone.

558
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,196
Scott: I got the hotel.

559
00:34:36,255 --> 00:34:39,594
Scott: I got the plane and I got Did our.

560
00:34:39,715 --> 00:34:40,639
Scott: oh we got back up ahead.

561
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,925
Scott: Okay, so nothing can fail.

562
00:34:41,985 --> 00:34:42,527
Scott: We'll be there.

563
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:44,931
Scott: Yep We don't know if I have a panel yet We've done.

564
00:34:44,951 --> 00:34:47,925
Scott: we've done panels literally every every single pack since.

565
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:49,030
Scott: oh wait, we've had a panel.

566
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:52,129
Scott: I can't imagine they wouldn't give us one but it could have just in case.

567
00:34:52,772 --> 00:34:56,850
Rym: Yeah, looking forward to this packs in a big way I'm skipping PAX dev.

568
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:00,041
Rym: I don't want to but I got a lot of shit going on.

569
00:35:00,061 --> 00:35:02,510
Rym: It's one of the best kind of need those vacation days.

570
00:35:02,891 --> 00:35:04,860
Rym: I'll probably go to PAX dev next year.

571
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:12,227
Rym: Mmm, but the thing that sucks is this year We actually had a really good panel I wanted to do at dev and I had to back out of it because I'm not going.

572
00:35:12,549 --> 00:35:16,901
Rym: so There's a chance I'll do that panel at regular packs.

573
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:19,550
Rym: That panel does not involve Scott it involves other people.

574
00:35:20,398 --> 00:35:26,687
Rym: So if that panel happens Then you'll be able to see it at regular packs without having to buy like a $400 badge to go see it.

575
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:29,494
Scott: Mm-hmm All right Let's go.

576
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:30,216
Rym: Let's go.

577
00:35:30,256 --> 00:35:30,718
Rym: Let's do it.

578
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,090
Scott: So micro services is uh, it's a fad.

579
00:35:34,552 --> 00:35:37,164
Scott: It's a fad but it's also somewhat legit sort of.

580
00:35:37,345 --> 00:35:38,370
Rym: it's a good idea.

581
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:46,115
Rym: but like you know the more I've realized there's a fundamental theme and all this kind of show that GeekNights does and the theme is Here is a design pattern.

582
00:35:46,717 --> 00:35:51,230
Rym: it is useful when it's useful and it is a bad idea when it's not a bad idea.

583
00:35:51,351 --> 00:35:53,341
Scott: I think the main problem is that it's actually.

584
00:35:53,502 --> 00:36:00,490
Scott: it's one of those things where like You know, you look at something like other fads like containers or no SQL, right?

585
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,709
Scott: And those are things that became fads or blockchains.

586
00:36:04,732 --> 00:36:14,609
Scott: They're fads Technological fads that are really only useful for a small number of applications like machine learning only useful for a small number At least now right there.

587
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:22,090
Scott: it doesn't have this wide application but like everyone starts trying to use it because it's a fad and then it backs off to the Point where only the people who need to use it use it.

588
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:30,469
Scott: But actually most companies that have software development where they're building tools and systems for the company to use Which is the kind of places that I work.

589
00:36:31,531 --> 00:36:32,878
Scott: You know, I don't work for tech companies.

590
00:36:32,918 --> 00:36:35,785
Scott: I work for companies as an engineer building software the company needs.

591
00:36:36,471 --> 00:36:58,808
Scott: Micro services are actually usually a pretty good pattern for most places because a lot of people make the accident of they build One custom system that's like for their biggest application Right, like the thing that does the core of their business and then they start building more stuff and rather than build separate new systems they just keep putting all the code in the same code base on the same platform on the same hardware on the same.

592
00:36:59,129 --> 00:37:07,716
Scott: and is They get this one giant monolithic application that does everything and that's usually a bad idea for any software architecture No matter what your application is.

593
00:37:08,097 --> 00:37:17,567
Scott: and micro services which means in general Splitting things up and do separate programs So you don't have just one program that does everything is usually a good idea.

594
00:37:17,587 --> 00:37:18,230
Scott: to some extent.

595
00:37:18,591 --> 00:37:23,090
Scott: The problem is not that everyone's doing this fad, which is usually the problem.

596
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:28,566
Scott: The problem is is that people are very very bad because they've never built micro services before.

597
00:37:28,686 --> 00:37:39,577
Scott: usually they don't know How to design systems make the splits in the wrong day They cut the services in the wrong places and they end up Making a lot of work for themselves.

598
00:37:39,597 --> 00:37:43,696
Scott: because now maybe you've got two services or more that should have been part of the same Service.

599
00:37:43,716 --> 00:37:44,529
Scott: they went to micro.

600
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:52,162
Scott: Yeah And now you have to build a lot of glue because those services are constantly talking to each other When if you just had put them in the same service, they would have been fine.

601
00:37:52,282 --> 00:37:54,110
Scott: Yep, or they don't.

602
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:59,550
Scott: They don't cut enough to get enough of the benefit and they've got still things that could be cut down more.

603
00:37:59,824 --> 00:37:59,930
Scott: Yeah.

604
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:16,710
Scott: So it's like you have to actually be very intelligent have a big understanding of your systems and have a really strong understanding of technology to be able to cut and Separate your systems into the right pieces that make sense to gain the advantages without causing yourself more problems.

605
00:38:16,871 --> 00:38:19,890
Rym: I think the real source of a lot of the problems that's really the whole show.

606
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,396
Scott: There's a but people.

607
00:38:21,496 --> 00:38:23,183
Rym: I guess we can get a lot of examples.

608
00:38:23,203 --> 00:38:26,019
Scott: I got I got the best example in the world Oh the one you told me before.

609
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,321
Rym: Yeah.

610
00:38:26,422 --> 00:38:27,310
Rym: Yeah, that's a pretty good one.

611
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:29,524
Scott: I don't know if it's true, but it's good enough whether it's true or not.

612
00:38:29,846 --> 00:38:34,230
Rym: But like my There's many, you know, I have a very different job of what I had before.

613
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:43,150
Rym: But so I'm in the position of managing like Many different engineering teams and areas that are working on different things like a bunch of different silos.

614
00:38:43,572 --> 00:39:02,790
Rym: And because you can't have if you ever unless you're a tiny company You cannot expect every engineer in your company to know about everything your company does like that That design pattern like that management design pattern seems to happen when small engineering startup gets big and it's not managed.

615
00:39:03,334 --> 00:39:13,585
Rym: Yep, but so in that situation microservices are a very good way to Be able to maintain silos of expertise without having the opposite IBM problem of.

616
00:39:13,926 --> 00:39:15,170
Rym: you've got a bunch of silos.

617
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:19,730
Rym: They're basically independent development teams that literally know nothing about it.

618
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:28,650
Scott: Yeah, not only does it help technologically because you can separate all these systems, you know hardware wise and software wise But you can also separate your employees, right?

619
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:32,404
Scott: It's like someone can work on one service and not have to know about other services.

620
00:39:32,484 --> 00:39:45,450
Scott: if all your code isn't together in one Big system then that means you have to get all your employees no matter what they're working on all Coordinated in perfect unison to be able to deliver a product and put out a release and you'll never release anything.

621
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:55,930
Rym: but instead you can have a designer or a product manager on each one of those silos and then have a Separate person or a separate group whose job is to do things that combine all those services.

622
00:39:56,191 --> 00:40:03,170
Scott: And if your services are designed well and you made the cuts in the right places Then there isn't going to be a lot of communication between those services.

623
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:12,982
Scott: They're gonna be so independent of each other that it will be super rare where any one of those Services actually needs to like do something because another service did something.

624
00:40:13,002 --> 00:40:15,810
Scott: Yeah, that should really happen all like a super rare case.

625
00:40:17,131 --> 00:40:27,770
Scott: So the best example of microservices that I ever seen and I'm not sure how true this is Because this was told to me by an Amazon engineer over five years ago, so it could be that's ancient history.

626
00:40:28,032 --> 00:40:35,050
Scott: Yeah, it could be completely not true now as far as I know But it doesn't matter how true it is as to the reality of what Amazon does.

627
00:40:35,574 --> 00:40:37,410
Scott: What matters is that if it is true?

628
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:40,558
Scott: It's still a really good Architecture and it's still a good example to follow.

629
00:40:40,598 --> 00:40:41,060
Scott: true or not?

630
00:40:41,301 --> 00:40:44,271
Rym: that is it is a very good example of the right way to Do this.

631
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:46,759
Scott: so go to amazon.com and shop for something.

632
00:40:46,799 --> 00:40:47,922
Scott: go to a product page.

633
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:50,450
Scott: Yeah, pick a product go Rym go buy something.

634
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,554
Scott: How about a unique nice t-shirt?

635
00:40:51,895 --> 00:40:55,850
Rym: Oh, yeah, actually, that's probably a bad example because no there is one and you can actually buy.

636
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:59,125
Rym: In fact, I actually have two more t-shirt designs and I can now make hoodies.

637
00:40:59,146 --> 00:41:00,211
Rym: I'm gonna make a GeekNights hoodie Right.

638
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:01,598
Scott: The point is that nobody's buying this.

639
00:41:01,618 --> 00:41:03,950
Scott: go to a popular product like got four stars.

640
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:05,697
Scott: Yeah, what's something that we would recommend?

641
00:41:05,737 --> 00:41:09,170
Rym: people buy an Amazon this fancy gig night t-shirt that comes in two different colors.

642
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,403
Scott: How about something that's actually popular and I'm too late.

643
00:41:11,464 --> 00:41:12,067
Rym: I'm on the t-shirt.

644
00:41:12,088 --> 00:41:12,490
Rym: I'm not moving.

645
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,259
Scott: There's not enough stuff there for me to tell you.

646
00:41:14,279 --> 00:41:16,309
Rym: there is product description reviews, right?

647
00:41:16,671 --> 00:41:27,858
Scott: So if you look at an Amazon product page and you scroll down this page Like if you don't think about it when you're just shopping, but there's a lot of fucking stuff on this There's the photos this product info.

648
00:41:27,979 --> 00:41:30,487
Scott: There's the actual e-commerce part where you buy the product.

649
00:41:30,647 --> 00:41:33,940
Scott: There's the reviews There's the Q&A there's related products.

650
00:41:34,141 --> 00:41:36,170
Scott: There's people who bought this also bought this.

651
00:41:36,531 --> 00:41:40,649
Scott: There's like you just keep scrolling and the page keeps loading new shit.

652
00:41:41,191 --> 00:41:48,390
Scott: It's like there's so many features on this product page it is insane If you try to think about it, like if you're a software engineer.

653
00:41:48,751 --> 00:41:50,136
Scott: How do I make this like?

654
00:41:50,236 --> 00:41:54,670
Scott: try to fucking make this even just like as a WordPress plug-in or just as a Django?

655
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:57,026
Rym: Just try to make it as hard coding the CSS.

656
00:41:57,107 --> 00:41:58,832
Scott: try to make Like.

657
00:41:58,953 --> 00:42:00,098
Scott: this would be so red.

658
00:42:00,138 --> 00:42:01,524
Scott: How many databases queries?

659
00:42:01,544 --> 00:42:02,870
Scott: Do you need to make this page?

660
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:13,324
Scott: It would like if even if you had no visitors to your site if you tried to make an e-commerce site that did all of This it would load slow as fucking hell even though you have no better example.

661
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:14,288
Rym: This is a camcorder.

662
00:42:14,328 --> 00:42:14,990
Rym: I'm looking at by.

663
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:15,673
Scott: That's a good one.

664
00:42:15,693 --> 00:42:16,356
Rym: So like you got like.

665
00:42:16,396 --> 00:42:17,280
Rym: oh, yeah, so let's see.

666
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,490
Rym: We got the images which is like their area.

667
00:42:19,591 --> 00:42:20,341
Rym: There's videos.

668
00:42:20,382 --> 00:42:27,690
Rym: they got video features Scroll down after the frequently bought together and customers reviewed this also viewed this.

669
00:42:28,251 --> 00:42:34,310
Rym: Here's just a whole bunch of fucking like product information from the manufacturer like images and their own design.

670
00:42:34,471 --> 00:42:38,828
Scott: This some system somewhere where the manufacturers and sellers go in and put that in there.

671
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:41,215
Scott: Yeah Look how many features.

672
00:42:41,255 --> 00:42:49,479
Scott: so the secret is is that each part as far as I've been told each part of this product page is A completely separate microservice right date.

673
00:42:49,579 --> 00:42:53,370
Scott: somewhere at Amazon are a bunch of computers that are just the Q&A system.

674
00:42:53,714 --> 00:42:57,825
Scott: That's all they do is Q&A Right, and there's another system that just the review system.

675
00:42:57,905 --> 00:42:58,690
Scott: all it does is reviews.

676
00:42:58,791 --> 00:42:59,700
Scott: It doesn't do anything else.

677
00:42:59,821 --> 00:43:05,090
Scott: all it is reviews Right and that review system that Q&A system that frequently bought together system.

678
00:43:05,614 --> 00:43:07,730
Scott: They have absolutely nothing to do with any of the other systems.

679
00:43:07,971 --> 00:43:20,110
Scott: you can take that Q&A system from Amazon if they gave you the source code which they won't and you could install it on your Own hardware and instead of attaching the only attachment it has to Amazon should be as far as I can tell the product IDs.

680
00:43:20,671 --> 00:43:30,950
Scott: You could attach that review system to the GeekNights episode IDs and we can suddenly just have reviews of GeekNights Episodes instead of reviews of em and we wouldn't have to change a single line of code.

681
00:43:31,271 --> 00:43:36,450
Scott: There is no dependency of that Q&A system on actual Amazon products other than that.

682
00:43:36,751 --> 00:43:41,410
Scott: You know the separate sets of cues and A's are together based on the product IDs.

683
00:43:41,751 --> 00:43:43,055
Scott: All right, and how that.

684
00:43:43,095 --> 00:43:47,890
Scott: but wait if these are all separate systems, how do they all load them together on this one product page?

685
00:43:48,110 --> 00:44:07,931
Scott: Well, there's a system the amazon.com system that runs the website and what it does is There's somewhere as a bucket an s3 bucket and in that bucket for every single product at Amazon There's a file and in that file is the HTML of the Q&A section and the name of the file is the product ID of The product.

686
00:44:08,352 --> 00:44:20,268
Scott: so this amazon.com system as I was told six years ago goes to these buckets pulls together these already rendered HTMLs right of all these different sections of the site and just paste them all together.

687
00:44:20,529 --> 00:44:25,504
Scott: now That's the only glue they have is go to a bunch of buckets get HTML and paste together.

688
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:27,350
Rym: now that part the specifics.

689
00:44:28,071 --> 00:44:30,864
Rym: The specifics of that aren't really relevant to microservices.

690
00:44:30,884 --> 00:44:31,286
Rym: You could do it.

691
00:44:31,387 --> 00:44:34,970
Scott: Anyway, no What's relevant is the fact that they have done it in such a way?

692
00:44:35,191 --> 00:44:35,492
Scott: It's not.

693
00:44:35,512 --> 00:44:39,045
Scott: that that way is the best way or the right way or whatever for a website.

694
00:44:39,065 --> 00:44:40,490
Rym: That's a highly scalable way.

695
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:44,070
Scott: It's that not only is highly scalable But it means that the Q&A system can do it.

696
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:46,250
Scott: Just if you're working on it, you can do whatever the fuck you want.

697
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:48,120
Scott: You don't have to worry about what Amazon that comes doing.

698
00:44:48,461 --> 00:44:52,462
Scott: if you're doing the review system You can just do anything you want in the review system.

699
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:55,918
Scott: change it up mix it up change Yeah And it won't matter because you're.

700
00:44:56,219 --> 00:45:01,810
Scott: the way it's integrated together with the other stuff is Like as long as the visuals are together, right?

701
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:02,913
Scott: You're all good.

702
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:10,662
Rym: now one sort of I don't want to say an anti-pattern but a problem I see with this micro this microservice architecture with this website as an example.

703
00:45:11,204 --> 00:45:28,330
Rym: a lot of people will have this page Basically hit 20 different micro services to generate all these things and those services all have varying SLA's varying quality or One of them loads slowly and then the page like starts rendering and weird chunks.

704
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:31,118
Rym: Yeah and there's actually a really easy solution to that.

705
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:36,459
Rym: you have some sort of middle tier or some sort of Buffer like in between your services.

706
00:45:36,981 --> 00:45:41,578
Rym: like if you have a web page just gonna hit 10 micro services Have a mid tier of some kind.

707
00:45:41,598 --> 00:45:45,470
Rym: that'll hit the micro services and interleave the data into your rendered HTML.

708
00:45:45,631 --> 00:45:49,630
Scott: I mean the two hardest problems in programming are naming things and caching validation, right?

709
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:53,283
Scott: So you basically when you have micro services, that's one of the benefits actually.

710
00:45:53,343 --> 00:45:55,430
Scott: It's not it's not a it's not a gotcha, right?

711
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:56,195
Scott: It's like a benefit.

712
00:45:56,235 --> 00:46:04,966
Scott: It's like oh because they've separated these services I can actually introduce IT solutions like caching layers and proxy layers and load balancing layers like

713
00:46:05,007 --> 00:46:07,115
Rym: that pre-rendered HTML Brilliant

714
00:46:07,276 --> 00:46:24,727
Scott: in between all of these different services Whereas if everything is part of one application running in the same processes and threads in the same CPU and you want a load balance You now have to code that inside your application Whereas if now if you've got, you know, they're separated there on physically separate computers running separate services.

715
00:46:25,028 --> 00:46:33,793
Scott: You can now introduce Varnish or Amazon load balancers or any other kinds all kinds of routers network, you know Firewalls.

716
00:46:33,813 --> 00:46:40,610
Scott: you can put any kind of nonsense you want in between to solve these other problems Whereas otherwise those tools would be unavailable.

717
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:44,742
Rym: Because look at this nothing on this page needs to be stateful in any way.

718
00:46:45,384 --> 00:46:53,798
Scott: if I refresh the page if you do a different Service if you go to the Q&A section to actually answer like if you go to do reviews It'll often bring you to a separate page.

719
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:55,444
Scott: That's just reviews and nothing else on it.

720
00:46:55,525 --> 00:46:57,598
Scott: Yep, when you go to check out It's just check out.

721
00:46:57,618 --> 00:46:58,690
Scott: There's nothing else there, right?

722
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:07,070
Scott: You've gone and now you're at when you're actually real-time accessing a system It's like you're only looking at stuff from that one system other than like the navbar or whatever, right?

723
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:15,152
Scott: You know, so it's like you can sort of tell from the interface of Amazon a little bit about the architecture behind the scenes of Amazon.com.

724
00:47:15,293 --> 00:47:17,361
Rym: So how do you figure out where to draw the lines?

725
00:47:17,382 --> 00:47:19,350
Rym: Can we come up with generic guidance, right?

726
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:20,815
Rym: It seems like so many people already

727
00:47:20,855 --> 00:47:32,230
Scott: talked about is a little bit right but if you want as little talking as possible Right, so if you were to say do the Q&A system You wouldn't have a Q system and an A system because they would have to talk to each other too much, right?

728
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:35,304
Scott: These things are sharing the same database, right?

729
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:36,290
Scott: It's it's sort of obvious.

730
00:47:36,431 --> 00:47:38,070
Scott: This is a really obvious case here, right?

731
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:44,410
Scott: But when you actually get to your real business Becomes harder to draw the lines because you want to have a lot of talking between systems, right?

732
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:48,643
Scott: So one thing is that you got to say, okay, you know, there's probably.

733
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,630
Scott: you have a monolithic application already.

734
00:47:51,275 --> 00:47:54,416
Scott: Look at what's already Sort of going across.

735
00:47:54,476 --> 00:47:58,814
Scott: draw the lines where you feel they belong first and then look and say, okay When would be?

736
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:01,090
Scott: when would something need to cross the lines, right?

737
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:01,551
Scott: When?

738
00:48:01,732 --> 00:48:08,348
Scott: when I need to join tables in these two databases together, even though I drew a line between them when would this need to make an API call to that?

739
00:48:08,368 --> 00:48:13,210
Scott: and You know if you can minimize that as much as possible, you're probably drawing lines in a good place.

740
00:48:14,872 --> 00:48:26,722
Scott: The other thing you want to do is that a lot of times I notice the times the lines are crossed will be for Reporting or for Notification or for some certain use cases.

741
00:48:26,822 --> 00:48:28,589
Rym: reporting in particular, right?

742
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:33,090
Scott: Red reporting is usually something that's like everyone has and will go across all systems.

743
00:48:33,251 --> 00:48:36,329
Scott: right because you and you want to join all your data together to report and everything.

744
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:51,686
Scott: and What you really got to do in those cases is like hey you know instead of having this reporting and you know instead of keeping things together to make reporting easier or Separating them to make you know and then making reporting difficult make reporting its own service.

745
00:48:52,068 --> 00:48:53,756
Scott: Yep, right That's all over by itself.

746
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:55,950
Rym: and then and then the query all the things right.

747
00:48:57,276 --> 00:49:00,350
Scott: You can't join these two tables together because they're from separate services.

748
00:49:00,651 --> 00:49:09,864
Scott: But now the reporting system can once or once per report query all the microservices one at a time that all right Collect all the data from them and then mix it together.

749
00:49:09,964 --> 00:49:10,970
Scott: and now that's its own thing.

750
00:49:11,452 --> 00:49:14,970
Scott: And now you don't have reporting code mixed in with all your stuff, right?

751
00:49:15,293 --> 00:49:17,893
Scott: So you got to think about those sort of Like.

752
00:49:17,994 --> 00:49:21,810
Scott: there's almost like even now you've separated the different parts of your application.

753
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:29,292
Scott: There are some features that they all have in common and those features need to sort of come off of everything and become their own Service.

754
00:49:29,534 --> 00:49:29,735
Rym: Yep.

755
00:49:30,177 --> 00:49:32,570
Rym: Now you also don't want to get too small with these services.

756
00:49:33,192 --> 00:49:34,116
Rym: I'm looking at the Wikipedia.

757
00:49:34,136 --> 00:49:37,430
Rym: they even call that anti pattern nano services, right?

758
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:48,050
Rym: That's when you cut too much and now things have to talk a lot and basically comes down to if you split a service out And you can't come up with any reason for anyone to query that service by itself.

759
00:49:48,491 --> 00:49:54,127
Rym: Mm-hmm, like is is there literally no one who would ever hit that API without also hitting another API?

760
00:49:54,368 --> 00:49:55,250
Rym: then you've gone too far.

761
00:49:55,290 --> 00:50:01,090
Scott: Imagine yourself being a developer and you're working on one of the services and think about how often when you're coding a feature for that.

762
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:02,577
Scott: New sir, like imagine like, okay.

763
00:50:02,618 --> 00:50:03,462
Scott: I'll draw the cut here.

764
00:50:03,884 --> 00:50:05,030
Scott: pick one of the sides of the cut.

765
00:50:05,272 --> 00:50:05,799
Scott: Yeah, I'll say all right.

766
00:50:05,819 --> 00:50:07,180
Scott: This is my microservice All right.

767
00:50:07,731 --> 00:50:12,007
Scott: Now imagine a feature you want to add to that microservice and then imagine how you would code it.

768
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:23,690
Scott: theoretically if you think that encoding that migrus encoding that feature for that microservice say Would I be able to code that feature for this service without touching any of the other services?

769
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:27,744
Scott: Right or would I have to make commits to two services in order to get this feature built?

770
00:50:28,347 --> 00:50:36,724
Scott: if you have to make commits to two services to get that feature built you either a Cut too small and made a nano service and you should combine those two things.

771
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:43,094
Scott: that you can make one commit to add that feature or That feature that you're adding is Something like reporting.

772
00:50:43,114 --> 00:50:47,590
Scott: that should be its own service and it should be somewhat common sense to figure out which of the two it is.

773
00:50:47,755 --> 00:50:47,865
Rym: Yep.

774
00:50:48,373 --> 00:51:00,279
Rym: so if you want like if your career path as a someone who cares about technology is listening to GeekNights if your goal is to be like a chief architect or a CTO or a product manager.

775
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,783
Rym: This is this kind of stuff.

776
00:51:01,803 --> 00:51:03,448
Rym: You need to understand like.

777
00:51:03,528 --> 00:51:13,730
Rym: this is The architecture side that makes you very valuable to a company Even potentially irrespective of your actual raw computer science coding ability

778
00:51:14,132 --> 00:51:22,710
Scott: Yep, but having computer science coding ability will make it easier for you to you know Implement techniques and know where to you know separate services and things

779
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,957
Rym: Yep, which again comes down to how big is your cut.

780
00:51:24,977 --> 00:51:28,829
Rym: like some companies will have functional programmers separate from like.

781
00:51:28,889 --> 00:51:36,450
Scott: also You also have to really have to understand the application architecture of the different services like oh this one has database This one has some sort of caching mechanism.

782
00:51:36,534 --> 00:51:38,194
Scott: Yes how the network is arranged.

783
00:51:38,455 --> 00:51:51,190
Scott: you have to have this sort of holistic understanding of well someone has to write of how the You know the hardware and the software works right on a not granular level but on you know broad level so that you can know.

784
00:51:51,471 --> 00:52:06,510
Scott: Ah, well, actually I know that this application is constantly writing over here You know to these to this storage thing, which means it should probably be its own deal Right and just provide that data out with an API and nothing else should be part of that, right?

785
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:16,866
Rym: But again, it also it means that someone like me I need to know what micro services are available in my whole like infrastructure But I literally don't need to know what's behind those API's?

786
00:52:16,907 --> 00:52:17,469
Rym: I can trust them.

787
00:52:17,971 --> 00:52:22,968
Rym: They'll do what they say they do and I can use them as a menu of services to build the thing.

788
00:52:23,028 --> 00:52:23,570
Rym: I want to build.

789
00:52:25,912 --> 00:52:26,758
Rym: Yeah, that's probably it.

790
00:52:26,919 --> 00:52:31,461
Scott: there's not much else to say but you know I mean you can read this Wikipedia article though as I'm serious a lot of.

791
00:52:31,501 --> 00:52:36,793
Scott: there's been a lot of literature about micro services and it's one of those things sort of like It's not.

792
00:52:36,873 --> 00:52:39,907
Scott: you know testing is one of those things where people like preach it, but they don't.

793
00:52:40,027 --> 00:52:51,750
Scott: they don't do it Yeah and it's a lot of the things they preach are actually not practical and like you can't actually do all those things realistically and you Maybe shouldn't unless you're unless you're doing medical stuff, then you should yeah, but that's a whole different ballgame.

794
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:54,470
Scott: But micro services is the thing you can do, right?

795
00:52:54,731 --> 00:52:58,347
Scott: And it's like you probably should do right and a lot of the literature is actually right.

796
00:52:58,507 --> 00:53:02,000
Scott: most of it Here's a better but most people fail at it.

797
00:53:02,081 --> 00:53:03,867
Scott: Despite that even though they're trying.

798
00:53:04,028 --> 00:53:04,670
Rym: here's the last bit.

799
00:53:05,031 --> 00:53:07,159
Rym: what are the situations where you definitely should not?

800
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:12,429
Rym: and I think it comes down to Are you all making literally only one thing?

801
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:17,786
Rym: Yeah, like you're literally this simple website is all your outputting like.

802
00:53:17,866 --> 00:53:27,370
Scott: don't over engineer it Yeah, I mean well even sometimes where even if you you know You look at something like a WordPress blog right and somebody will get all these plugins on the WordPress blog.

803
00:53:27,552 --> 00:53:28,286
Scott: Yeah, and it's like.

804
00:53:28,307 --> 00:53:37,018
Scott: well Yes if you were gonna make the ideal application architecture that would be microservices and not a whole bunch of plugins on one WordPress installation, but You aren't big enough.

805
00:53:37,038 --> 00:53:38,083
Scott: You're a tiny blog.

806
00:53:38,504 --> 00:53:39,991
Scott: So just fucking use the plugins It does.

807
00:53:40,052 --> 00:53:43,930
Scott: it's not worth you because microservices increases your engineering effort.

808
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:49,950
Scott: You need teams and you need you need to be a certain size to build all these separate systems because it adds overhead.

809
00:53:50,373 --> 00:53:52,750
Scott: Right when you make more systems rather than have one system.

810
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:58,283
Scott: Yeah So don't go doing it Even if it's the right thing to make that system the best it can be.

811
00:53:58,424 --> 00:54:11,273
Scott: if you can get away with a shitty system Yeah, and you don't have incredible resources to build a fancy system, which also applies don't do this for prototypes experiments proofs of concepts Like the.

812
00:54:11,755 --> 00:54:16,230
Rym: but I think this is more generally good advice of don't over engineer things that don't need the over engineer.

813
00:54:16,593 --> 00:54:18,126
Scott: Don't preemptively optimize.

814
00:54:18,347 --> 00:54:26,815
Scott: Yeah Yeah, cuz if you ever find yourself saying I'm doing this because in the future me white we might want to know No, dude, that means do not do.

815
00:54:26,855 --> 00:54:28,802
Scott: that is not a supporting reason to do that thing.

816
00:54:28,943 --> 00:54:29,364
Rym: That is the.

817
00:54:29,424 --> 00:54:31,678
Rym: that is the novice mistake That's right.

818
00:54:31,779 --> 00:54:32,529
Rym: That's freshman year.

819
00:54:32,891 --> 00:54:34,377
Rym: If you know that sophomore year the future.

820
00:54:34,417 --> 00:54:36,304
Scott: don't worry about what could be possible in the future.

821
00:54:36,364 --> 00:54:41,548
Scott: do what is best for the now What is known to be true things you definitely are going to do for sure?

822
00:54:42,131 --> 00:54:47,009
Scott: Design for that and if in the future it does happen that you might want to then change it.

823
00:54:47,318 --> 00:54:48,633
Rym: Yeah Cuz it's.

824
00:54:48,853 --> 00:54:50,317
Rym: if you're gonna like the time.

825
00:54:50,357 --> 00:55:00,950
Rym: it'll take you the opportunity cost of doing heavy over engineering very early on Compared to what it would take to when you've grown and have twice as many engineers to rewrite something old you built.

826
00:55:01,912 --> 00:55:05,070
Rym: Also, the technology landscape might change in those couple years.

827
00:55:05,753 --> 00:55:09,650
Rym: I mean look at how much databases have changed in the last five years.

828
00:55:09,831 --> 00:55:11,666
Scott: That's another great thing about microservices.

829
00:55:11,686 --> 00:55:16,150
Scott: is that you know You can even when new technologies come around one service can like that.

830
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:25,902
Scott: Maybe you know has time the developers have time to work on something concern updating to newer technologies and start messing around Microservices backed by some old postgres, you know, say there's some new hotness.

831
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:27,930
Scott: I give you like an Amazon product page, right?

832
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:28,613
Scott: It's like okay.

833
00:55:28,653 --> 00:55:30,179
Scott: How much do people really care about?

834
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,630
Scott: the people who bought this also bought this right?

835
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:33,956
Scott: That's probably semi important.

836
00:55:34,238 --> 00:55:40,349
Scott: Whatever is working on that and don't kid yourself There is someone whose job is I work on the something who bought this also bought this.

837
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:49,288
Scott: Yeah, like there's someone whose only job is I'm the owner of that part of the page That whoever's working on that can probably have time to experiment and really improve.

838
00:55:49,328 --> 00:55:55,362
Scott: and you know Work on machine learning type stuff and get some fanciness going on in there Right, whereas the people working on say the photos part.

839
00:55:55,683 --> 00:55:56,910
Scott: They probably can't fuck around.

840
00:55:57,798 --> 00:56:04,510
Scott: You cannot fuck that up Yep, so, you know, they can probably had to wait and see and you can have different systems running different technologies.

841
00:56:05,196 --> 00:56:15,250
Rym: I guess one other concern is it does Mean that you need because usually depending I mean if it's how big you are But you might have people doing QA in each one of those silos like for each microservice.

842
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:21,510
Rym: If you have something that's written by microservices, you need a holistic quality assurance solution.

843
00:56:22,092 --> 00:56:34,506
Rym: You need something or someone that is testing the integrated final page irrespective You Usually the services that integrate the other services and call their API.

844
00:56:34,787 --> 00:56:36,633
Rym: that's where that QA They're usually.

845
00:56:36,653 --> 00:56:39,924
Scott: that usually is also a service and usually has its own QA.

846
00:56:39,984 --> 00:56:41,208
Scott: So that's where that happens.

847
00:56:41,249 --> 00:56:51,950
Scott: Yep, right You know, it's like if you know a lot of times even if your own QA will say that your own service is all good You know the other the consumers of your service might be like you guys just mess something up and then you.

848
00:56:57,216 --> 00:56:59,760
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
