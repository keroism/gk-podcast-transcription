00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:18,206
Rym: It's Monday February 5th 2018 I'm Rym, I'm hungry and this is GeekNights tonight M.2 and you.

2
00:00:18,246 --> 00:00:21,680
Rym: we're talking about the modern state of storage for computers.

3
00:00:22,882 --> 00:00:23,897
Rym: Let's do this.

4
00:00:25,821 --> 00:00:33,591
Rym: So the other day I was sitting in the living room and I got a halogen torsier the last Halogen bulb in my apartment.

5
00:00:33,712 --> 00:00:34,436
Scott: You don't need that shit.

6
00:00:34,456 --> 00:00:35,079
Scott: get LED people.

7
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:38,401
Rym: No, because LED bulbs still they are good Like.

8
00:00:38,502 --> 00:00:41,379
Rym: I actually have an LED torsier in this room and it's really good.

9
00:00:41,964 --> 00:00:47,054
Rym: But the torsier I got in the living room one I paid a lot of money for that lamp and two it's really.

10
00:00:47,074 --> 00:00:48,440
Rym: it's like the perfect lamp.

11
00:00:50,123 --> 00:00:51,708
Rym: No, because it doesn't have glass on top.

12
00:00:51,728 --> 00:00:52,530
Rym: the way this one does.

13
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:56,000
Rym: okay, but I was sitting there and suddenly it just goes.

14
00:00:57,701 --> 00:01:03,219
Rym: Light turns off didn't explode because there's no like giant tempered glass shield on top of it.

15
00:01:03,801 --> 00:01:07,440
Rym: So I go over to it and the light bulb that has had from the beginning just died.

16
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:15,654
Rym: I look at it and I unlike kids younger than us who will probably not actually know how Analog like light bulbs work.

17
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,974
Rym: I Know how they work and I saw the filament was just broken.

18
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:25,486
Rym: Mm-hmm I never bought a new light bulb for that and let me tell you if you know if you do.

19
00:01:25,546 --> 00:01:27,653
Rym: I did find one but it's it's shady.

20
00:01:28,275 --> 00:01:39,660
Rym: if you need to buy a Like an Edison screw bulb for anything It's pretty easy to figure out because the only thing you need to know is that is an Edison screw of the normal size.

21
00:01:40,244 --> 00:01:41,655
Rym: And then how many watts?

22
00:01:41,695 --> 00:01:42,360
Scott: in other countries?

23
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,431
Rym: They have this similar same light bulb standard and it's pretty much how many watts does it take?

24
00:01:47,313 --> 00:01:55,992
Rym: if you need any sort of like Modern LED bulb usually like the bulb is not a bulb It's just LEDs that are built into the lamp.

25
00:01:56,052 --> 00:01:57,679
Rym: if it dies you throw away the lamp.

26
00:01:58,762 --> 00:01:59,166
Scott: There are.

27
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:00,700
Scott: I have LED bulbs in all my land.

28
00:02:00,908 --> 00:02:01,140
Rym: Oh, yeah.

29
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,012
Rym: But increasingly modern lamps like this lamp.

30
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:04,079
Rym: that was not cheap either.

31
00:02:04,847 --> 00:02:08,150
Rym: It the LED is just in it Like the LED is built into the land.

32
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,919
Scott: not seen a lot of those and I wouldn't buy one of those.

33
00:02:10,342 --> 00:02:12,058
Rym: Uh, they're pretty much what you want to buy these days.

34
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:19,879
Scott: now I want to buy a normal lamp that I can put a bulb into because that way when they switch from LEDs to some new Light technology I can just screw in a different bulb.

35
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,720
Scott: I don't think a new light technology from regular light to compact fluorescent to LED all with the same light lamp.

36
00:02:26,904 --> 00:02:29,520
Rym: I don't think a new technology is on the horizon.

37
00:02:29,921 --> 00:02:35,240
Scott: I think they'll make something to make a tiny Sun that you can screw in the one thing I can say a tiny star.

38
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:41,160
Rym: So why have I had two CFLs in the living room in those dim lamps?

39
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,680
Rym: I use for like accent lighting and one of them died.

40
00:02:44,307 --> 00:02:55,380
Rym: I didn't get a new one yet But I happen to still have one box of the last four old style Light bulbs that I own just incandescent light.

41
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:55,923
Rym: I have in good.

42
00:02:55,983 --> 00:02:57,492
Rym: I had a box with three.

43
00:02:57,512 --> 00:02:58,820
Scott: you're gonna last like five minutes.

44
00:02:59,443 --> 00:03:01,593
Scott: It's like we forget like how often those went out.

45
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:03,060
Scott: They went out all the goddamn time.

46
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,480
Scott: We just are you so used to it, but like it now that we've had come back for us and like LED.

47
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:11,740
Rym: No, I thought I bought that thing a fucking bulge when I moved into this.

48
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:13,760
Scott: It's like they never they never die.

49
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,079
Scott: So the idea of like a like a light bulb going out used to be a common occurrence.

50
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:18,891
Scott: now It's like super super rare.

51
00:03:19,193 --> 00:03:25,079
Rym: Yep, so I didn't throw them away because they were still good, but I wasn't gonna use them.

52
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:31,000
Rym: So I put the cut the the this old bulb into one of these lamps.

53
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:37,820
Rym: So one of these lamps are identical lamps has a CFL like a modern one and the other one has an old incandescent bulb.

54
00:03:38,743 --> 00:03:47,869
Rym: All the people who say that they can tell and that the light quality is different or something No one can tell me which one is which.

55
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:57,572
Scott: no unless they go look at the bulb inside of the fix It's the same thing is like the bottle of expensive wine bottle with the man of Chevy's and it tastes Yeah, it's the same thing.

56
00:03:57,795 --> 00:04:07,660
Rym: However When I try only tell the light the light the white balance, however, I tried putting in white But I tried putting an LED in one of those cuz I was gonna replace the CFL's even though we're still good with LEDs.

57
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:09,779
Rym: I did that because they just use so much less power.

58
00:04:10,881 --> 00:04:15,960
Rym: The LEDs at least the ones I had which are these like daylight ones that are pretty good white light.

59
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:16,538
Scott: That's what I have.

60
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:24,700
Rym: They looked pretty shit in those fixtures and you could tell because the fixtures made him have sort of this greenish greenish character.

61
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,535
Rym: So I find I got to figure out what to do with that.

62
00:04:28,575 --> 00:04:30,964
Rym: There are LEDs I think provide.

63
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:32,470
Scott: you can just get daylight balance.

64
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,200
Scott: I mean not day instead of the white daylight ones You can get the yellow more yellow.

65
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,921
Rym: Yeah, I gotta get a different balance But there's.

66
00:04:38,222 --> 00:04:43,600
Rym: I gotta figure out if I can completely replace all my remaining CFL's with LEDs.

67
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:44,971
Rym: I've replaced most of them.

68
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:49,035
Rym: one in the bedroom It's like this fucking Sun that I plugged into the top of the tertiary.

69
00:04:49,617 --> 00:04:55,700
Scott: It's great But just get a light that the kind of using a driveway and that'll light up your room real good.

70
00:04:55,869 --> 00:04:56,000
Rym: Yeah.

71
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:08,020
Rym: so I think I'm talking years before that I had some xenon bulbs and some fixtures and actually replace those with LEDs because the Expensive LEDs that'll fit in those weird fixtures are way cheaper than an actual xenon bulb.

72
00:05:08,868 --> 00:05:18,359
Rym: but Halogens if you don't know the codes and like what a t3 is or a fucking d15 Good luck buying a halogen bulb.

73
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:25,780
Rym: But I found the one I needed from a non dodgy place and it was like eight bucks and that is way cheaper.

74
00:05:26,362 --> 00:05:32,447
Rym: Then the kind of LED bulb I would need to use this kind of t3 Connector or this.

75
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:34,160
Rym: well t3 form factor.

76
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,644
Scott: They're not making too many of those.

77
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:38,028
Scott: They're not exactly in high demand.

78
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:51,620
Rym: Yeah, so I'm gonna eventually probably buy a pure LED from the beginning light to replace this halogen but in the interim It was way cheaper to just buy this $8 halogen bulb because this halogen bulb lasted a decade.

79
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:53,687
Rym: This next one's probably gonna last another decade.

80
00:05:53,707 --> 00:05:53,988
Rym: Hmm.

81
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,694
Rym: That is my story.

82
00:05:55,714 --> 00:05:57,379
Rym: So we got any tech news.

83
00:05:58,182 --> 00:06:03,180
Scott: There is tech news, so I guess you know, there's been you know, many net neutrality talks.

84
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,376
Scott: It's not a lot new to say but actually there was something new to say.

85
00:06:06,396 --> 00:06:13,178
Scott: I told a lot Something happened that we sort of thought but we didn't know exactly how it was gonna go down.

86
00:06:13,198 --> 00:06:25,124
Scott: So In the United States, I guess this we got to make this tech talk and not legal talks Context because we do have a lot of non US listeners and we got a It's.

87
00:06:25,204 --> 00:06:27,276
Rym: you got to remember how kind of fucked up the u.s.

88
00:06:27,337 --> 00:06:27,618
Rym: Is from.

89
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:40,719
Scott: anyway There's a group called the FCC the Federal Communications Commission and they regulate, you know radio signals And cable TV and all sorts of electronic communications things telephones primarily, right?

90
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,527
Scott: And that includes ISPs and Internet's.

91
00:06:43,608 --> 00:06:44,671
Scott: they regulate that as well.

92
00:06:44,711 --> 00:06:47,460
Scott: They make you know, they make the regulations regulatory body.

93
00:06:48,481 --> 00:06:51,395
Scott: It's where if you want like a radio operators license you get it from the FCC.

94
00:06:51,495 --> 00:07:07,184
Scott: Yep, so The FCC, you know against the wishes of everyone except the FCC Undid the previous net neutrality regulations that we put in recently and so now there's back to the way it was before then Which is not good

95
00:07:07,505 --> 00:07:13,760
Rym: because the before then was a time when there really wasn't a modern internet and it wasn't a problem yet.

96
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,732
Rym: And the reason it's now actually becoming a problem.

97
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:18,860
Rym: Yeah, and we fixed it with legislation.

98
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:33,279
Scott: so What happened was as we said well, you know on the one hand there's a lot of states out there that disagree And they those states, you know, such as New York want to have the old rules back But states don't have the power to do that.

99
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,864
Scott: The federal government has the power to do that and our federal government is because it is an interstate deal Not a you know.

100
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,736
Scott: radio signals go across state lines.

101
00:07:40,817 --> 00:07:49,640
Scott: Yep telephones make calls across state lines Across state lines and out of the country is kind of broken right now, so we can't fix it there now.

102
00:07:49,821 --> 00:08:00,100
Scott: So some of the smart states found a nice loophole, which is very clever and they said, alright We can't pass some law in our state that says you have to have net neutrality to be an ISP.

103
00:08:00,304 --> 00:08:00,918
Scott: We can't do that.

104
00:08:01,424 --> 00:08:08,319
Scott: But what we can do is we can say this Anyone who wants to have a contract with our state to do some work or something?

105
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:14,020
Scott: Must be an ISP that adheres to these principles of net neutrality.

106
00:08:14,462 --> 00:08:18,115
Scott: So basically you don't have to be if you're an ISP in New York.

107
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,380
Scott: or what's the other state, Wisconsin?

108
00:08:19,863 --> 00:08:25,440
Rym: There's actually a Law makers in Montana, so it's now up to six states.

109
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,811
Rym: All right, so sit one, California, New York, North Carolina, and so North Carolina, Illinois might be the seventh and eighth I guess.

110
00:08:31,996 --> 00:08:32,097
Scott: okay.

111
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,815
Scott: But anyway, a bunch of states, you know saw this trick and all decided to go in on it.

112
00:08:36,135 --> 00:08:44,720
Scott: and the trick is this You you know can be an ISP and operate in New York and be very unmet neutral and you won't be breaking any laws.

113
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:56,540
Scott: But if you make a contract with New York State say to provide some service to an office of the state or who knows what Or say to use land that you're gonna run cables in that is leased from the state, right?

114
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:03,440
Scott: You know you're making a contract with the state Then you either a have to abide by net neutral principles or not have your contract with the state.

115
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,039
Scott: Just void it and the state will pay someone else for that, you know business.

116
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:14,000
Scott: So yeah, that's a it's a clever move And it's gonna go to court eventually.

117
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:22,949
Scott: But you know, I guess I haven't seen any unnet neutral activities on my internet yet That I could tell.

118
00:09:25,683 --> 00:09:28,244
Rym: Yeah, the thing is though I haven't had because there was a member.

119
00:09:28,264 --> 00:09:37,916
Rym: there's a period like four years ago where Netflix just wouldn't work that well in New York on Verizon Like that happened for a while, but it seemed to have calmed down.

120
00:09:37,937 --> 00:09:39,544
Scott: Yeah, there's a website You can go to fat.

121
00:09:39,585 --> 00:09:40,931
Scott: I think it's fast.com.

122
00:09:41,152 --> 00:09:48,640
Scott: FAST like speed fast And that is a site that will test your internet speed very very easily and it is run by Netflix.

123
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,626
Rym: No fancy that.

124
00:09:50,747 --> 00:09:57,219
Scott: Yeah, Netflix made this site to test your internet speed And you know sort of like see if anyone is throttling the Netflix, you know

125
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:13,434
Rym: this does set a sort of I don't say dangers but worrying precedent yet again that an issue in the United States is that Traditionally the only reason any state has wanted to do its own thing So-called states rights has been because of slavery or racism or religion.

126
00:10:13,555 --> 00:10:15,180
Rym: It's always been the bad sides of things.

127
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:15,366
Rym: Yeah

128
00:10:15,902 --> 00:10:23,320
Scott: States want rights because the federal government would have Regulations that would say don't be evil and it is like what we want to be evil states rights states rights

129
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:32,246
Rym: but and part of the reason why the other the correct side of the political spectrum didn't really push on those sorts of things is Complicated but they basically never did.

130
00:10:32,306 --> 00:10:35,597
Rym: you very rarely had states being like we're gonna do universal health care.

131
00:10:35,637 --> 00:10:36,280
Rym: Fuck y'all.

132
00:10:37,982 --> 00:10:41,280
Rym: So there's it seems with technology issues in particular.

133
00:10:42,180 --> 00:11:08,799
Rym: States that are on the left side are more and more willing in the United States to do stuff like this and there's a lot of reasons why that are beyond the scope of a Monday episode of GeekNights, but the problem is The main reason why we I have not pushed for this too hard Is that if you let these states that are intelligent do intelligent things like this And you let the states that are have better having problems because they voted in Republicans do the opposite of that.

134
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:15,420
Rym: You're just gonna increase the divide between people with technology and without with health care and without with computers and without.

135
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,139
Scott: That's gonna bring about the cyber dystopia that I've been waiting for.

136
00:11:20,724 --> 00:11:25,451
Rym: Not great for most people But it's I've been preparing for ever so long I have been to.

137
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:28,662
Scott: it rewards me because that's what I invested in and counted Huh?

138
00:11:28,702 --> 00:11:30,368
Scott: Well, I'm a selfish person.

139
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:32,074
Rym: We're deckers and company men.

140
00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:32,496
Rym: We're not.

141
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:38,517
Rym: we're not like the orcs Shadow run.

142
00:11:39,722 --> 00:11:42,580
Rym: It's a role-playing system where you can play an elf who is also a hacker.

143
00:11:42,921 --> 00:11:43,905
Rym: I dare you to find it.

144
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:45,572
Rym: Oh and a dragon runs for president.

145
00:11:45,652 --> 00:11:47,540
Rym: I dare you to define a more Rym setting.

146
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,529
Scott: We need the dragon president now more than ever.

147
00:11:49,871 --> 00:11:51,860
Rym: Yeah, I would vote dunkless on let's go.

148
00:11:59,723 --> 00:12:09,112
Rym: So in some other news, uh, this sort of come out that uber and lyft, you know those companies Uber more sucks less than the other one, but they both suck.

149
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:11,560
Rym: Yeah, not gonna get into why they're evil.

150
00:12:11,661 --> 00:12:13,360
Rym: But let's say uber is evil.

151
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:15,568
Scott: Do not use them ever.

152
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:18,318
Scott: use a legit cab or not something else.

153
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:32,436
Rym: now The hope has been that all those problems are made moot by accessible self-driving car technology Because self-driving cars mean that no one ever needs to take a cab anywhere again ever.

154
00:12:32,476 --> 00:12:33,659
Rym: the car itself does it?

155
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,718
Rym: that also means that maybe for most people individual ownership of cars doesn't even matter anymore.

156
00:12:39,738 --> 00:12:45,360
Rym: and There's a problem that a big part of all the employment in the United States is people driving cars.

157
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,344
Rym: We've talked about all this before.

158
00:12:46,445 --> 00:12:49,037
Scott: truck driver is the number one job in the country.

159
00:12:49,137 --> 00:12:55,190
Scott: in most states It's the number one job and then driver of car Period is like if you employ

160
00:12:55,231 --> 00:12:57,461
Rym: a huge percentage of the middle class You

161
00:12:57,502 --> 00:13:07,960
Scott: eliminated all the jobs where your job is to drive There would be not like that's like a very very perhaps double-digit percent of all jobs in the United States.

162
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:37,539
Rym: So it appears based on this article and some of the discussion that's been happening in the sphere lately That the company like companies like uber like uber They their endgame is to try to have regulation and urban planning and policies in place To basically ban the private use of self-driving cars Particularly in urban areas where you know the vast majority of people are.

163
00:13:38,914 --> 00:13:44,936
Rym: so I'm actually okay with the principle of you can't own cars anymore.

164
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:47,003
Rym: cars are Car should.

165
00:13:47,023 --> 00:14:01,260
Rym: in my in my ideal future car is just one more form of mass transit that drives very small numbers of people to destinations that not very many people want to go to and handles like last mile transportation.

166
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,919
Rym: But car should just be one more offering of the government right alongside train boss, etc.

167
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,340
Rym: So I'm okay with not letting people own their stupid cars anymore.

168
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:23,200
Rym: I'm not okay with private company using that legislation to be the sole owner of said cars to Continue to wage its war on mass transit and modern practice.

169
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:28,000
Scott: I mean even if they do do that, right and it would be it would be crappy in the short term.

170
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,535
Scott: Yeah, but historically speaking right that you used to have private subway IRT VMT.

171
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:34,180
Rym: Yeah, that was a terrible idea.

172
00:14:34,562 --> 00:14:36,771
Scott: We had private train terrible idea.

173
00:14:36,831 --> 00:14:37,133
Rym: Yeah.

174
00:14:37,153 --> 00:14:38,760
Scott: Yeah, you know, we still have private plane.

175
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,204
Rym: But yeah, you know what?

176
00:14:40,224 --> 00:14:48,360
Scott: Maybe we shouldn't know but the point is is that over time because they were so terrible They became not so public anymore, right?

177
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:59,570
Scott: Even if we let uber do this, it's like well, it'll just get nationalized eventually At least to the Amtrak level of nationalization,

178
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:30,740
Rym: yeah, but I guess from a technology standpoint The the thing self-driving cars are still gonna be crazy disruptive and that this is yet an example of one more way They're gonna be disruptive that a lot of people are not even thinking about whether or not private car ownership even matters and whether or not large conglomerate companies might use legislation ostensibly promoting better technology governance governance to in fact just control and industry as a private contractor.

179
00:15:32,581 --> 00:15:36,420
Rym: So in some other news, we got to talk about this because everyone was talking about it.

180
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,608
Rym: It was kind of a big deal.

181
00:15:37,628 --> 00:15:38,514
Scott: too much news going on.

182
00:15:38,635 --> 00:15:41,163
Rym: Yeah We got.

183
00:15:41,183 --> 00:15:42,387
Rym: let's see how that goes.

184
00:15:42,668 --> 00:15:45,017
Rym: you want to not talk about the Hawaii missile alert.

185
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:48,380
Scott: It's not that big You know, I feel like it's a. it's a. it's a beaten bush.

186
00:15:48,802 --> 00:15:49,405
Rym: I feel it wasn't.

187
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:50,290
Rym: it's partly.

188
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,100
Rym: we just didn't do a GeekNights around when it happened.

189
00:15:52,980 --> 00:16:01,060
Rym: But basically if you lived in Hawaii You got a legit notification from the government on your phone that said there's a fucking missile coming.

190
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:10,640
Rym: This is not a drill and Because of the way the government works that was not corrected for what like 40 minutes too long?

191
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,568
Rym: Yeah, I've 40 seconds might have been too long.

192
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:28,050
Rym: any number of seconds is too long, but the original story that came out I think the joke I saw on every UX designers Twitter was well I'm making a slide about this in my next TED talk Blamed it on the UI which is of course an awful UI.

193
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:43,317
Scott: the UI is atrocious the UX is atrocious Yeah, but I mean that's you know Because the only there are very few companies in very few situations where people producing software Right have a culture of valuing designing UI for example Apple.

194
00:16:43,477 --> 00:16:44,180
Scott: obvious, right?

195
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,400
Scott: But most places that produce software do not have a culture appreciation or care for design.

196
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:51,990
Scott: They just may it works.

197
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:53,580
Scott: You know, it's just a bunch of text on the screen.

198
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,182
Scott: Don't give a fuck.

199
00:16:54,242 --> 00:16:56,530
Scott: They don't even care or think about it.

200
00:16:56,872 --> 00:16:59,220
Scott: It's not even a matter of like being bad at designing, right?

201
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,272
Scott: It's like they actually don't care or even think about like.

202
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:03,295
Scott: design is not a step.

203
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:05,041
Scott: Yep, right It's like.

204
00:17:05,303 --> 00:17:08,733
Rym: but UX user experience goes one step behind just the design of a GUI.

205
00:17:08,773 --> 00:17:23,295
Rym: because yeah, this GUI is awful but the entire Process and procedures around something are also part of the user experience and the process here was bad And the the rules people had to follow were.

206
00:17:23,396 --> 00:17:26,980
Rym: it seems like Everything was bad in this situation.

207
00:17:28,142 --> 00:17:31,754
Rym: So this outcome was basically inevitable and I am shocked.

208
00:17:31,814 --> 00:17:32,978
Rym: It did not happen sooner.

209
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:41,120
Rym: Yeah I Guess the only point I really got here is that this is not just the story of a poorly designed menu caused a missile alert.

210
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:43,199
Rym: No, the story here is that?

211
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,261
Rym: GUIs.

212
00:17:44,804 --> 00:17:46,029
Rym: GUIs can prevent.

213
00:17:46,671 --> 00:17:50,819
Rym: our GUIs can mitigate or Minimize the chance of mistakes being made.

214
00:17:51,523 --> 00:17:55,240
Rym: UX design can also mitigate and minimize the chances of these things happening.

215
00:17:55,701 --> 00:18:00,135
Rym: but the story of bad decisions like this is always bigger than you think.

216
00:18:00,536 --> 00:18:04,150
Rym: and don't drill it down to One slide in some UX designers.

217
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,620
Rym: talk at some TEDx that you're gonna see next month.

218
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:10,660
Scott: I mean, it's just a question if I you know, we know how to design something, right?

219
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,198
Scott: You go to design places and it's like they always talk about how to design things better how to get a topography.

220
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:16,082
Scott: good It's like.

221
00:18:16,424 --> 00:18:20,360
Scott: but everyone there is someone who already cares about design, right and also they tend to care.

222
00:18:21,342 --> 00:18:29,214
Scott: If you got someone who's painting Warhammer miniatures, right and it's like oh and they're trying to do better at it You can show them techniques like oh, he's had a dry brush.

223
00:18:29,254 --> 00:18:30,260
Scott: Here's how to do that, right?

224
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,000
Scott: Oh, here's how to apply the primer better, right?

225
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:37,940
Scott: But if there's somebody who literally takes a can of red spray paint goes I'm done and like just doesn't give a fuck.

226
00:18:38,482 --> 00:18:39,425
Scott: It's like how.

227
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,528
Scott: it's like what do you?

228
00:18:40,568 --> 00:18:44,100
Scott: that's what you have most of the time in software production, right?

229
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:52,933
Scott: And it's not really a problem if someone does that in Warhammer cuz it's like, alright, that's what you like, bro I mean whatever right but it's a problem when you're hurt.

230
00:18:53,013 --> 00:19:05,620
Scott: any missile alert system for Hawaii It doesn't hurt anyone but a badly designed software Even if it is technically speaking in the code bug free the poor design could actually cause bugs.

231
00:19:06,022 --> 00:19:07,897
Scott: Yeah, I cut it pebkek.

232
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,877
Rym: So and you cannot assume that a user is going to follow a procedure.

233
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:13,500
Rym: do the right thing.

234
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:25,306
Rym: So a user experience has to take into account all of human failings and mitigate those things like say There's a situation where you have a UX that gates people to prevent Common mistakes from being made.

235
00:19:25,607 --> 00:19:31,086
Rym: like if they try like the if you wanna send a real missile alert You got to click on it.

236
00:19:31,126 --> 00:19:49,239
Rym: Like you got to do a confirmation thing of some kind You also have to assume that someone's going to go one step further and do all of that and then continue to proceed in making Their terrible mistake, so maybe you need a way to undo it a break glass Like you got a thing a lot of steps deeper than even a lot of UX designers do.

237
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:51,945
Rym: Last and least.

238
00:19:52,246 --> 00:19:53,249
Scott: Oh, yeah, come on.

239
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:54,454
Scott: There's not tech news round up here.

240
00:19:54,675 --> 00:19:55,979
Rym: This is kind of amazing.

241
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,272
Rym: Best Buy announced that they're no longer going to sell physical CDs.

242
00:20:00,313 --> 00:20:01,176
Scott: They still sell CDs.

243
00:20:01,537 --> 00:20:02,360
Rym: That's the news.

244
00:20:02,922 --> 00:20:06,275
Rym: I am shocked that any big stores sell CDs.

245
00:20:06,476 --> 00:20:06,797
Scott: I'm shocked.

246
00:20:06,837 --> 00:20:07,540
Scott: anyone buys CDs.

247
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:11,719
Rym: Yeah, I don't own a CD player, I don't think.

248
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,824
Scott: Yeah, I can play one in my In my computer.

249
00:20:17,045 --> 00:20:19,353
Rym: Oh, I still have my Fujitsu lifebook.

250
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,060
Rym: It has an optical drive in it.

251
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,365
Scott: Yeah, I have an optical drive.

252
00:20:22,445 --> 00:20:25,236
Rym: I also have one optical USB drive for emergencies.

253
00:20:25,296 --> 00:20:26,180
Rym: I guess I could play a CD.

254
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:29,629
Scott: I'm here cleaning up my The Connecticut house this weekend.

255
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:30,533
Scott: I found two disc men.

256
00:20:30,674 --> 00:20:31,579
Scott: I don't know if they worked or not.

257
00:20:31,941 --> 00:20:40,213
Rym: yeah, didn't care throw them out, but it seems like everyone's moving to streaming and Hardly anyone seems to care about owning music.

258
00:20:40,234 --> 00:20:45,520
Rym: streaming seems to be good enough And I think the whole industry is gonna have to align itself a hundred percent around streaming.

259
00:20:45,921 --> 00:20:47,746
Rym: Well ninety percent around streaming.

260
00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:50,995
Rym: ten percent around collectors that you can milk for a lot of money.

261
00:20:51,035 --> 00:20:57,283
Scott: There is a niche industry Going on like the lossless players There.

262
00:20:57,444 --> 00:21:00,233
Scott: first of all, there are people who are stupid and collect vinyls.

263
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:02,360
Scott: Yep, right of new things for some reason.

264
00:21:03,742 --> 00:21:12,020
Rym: Okay, whatever you like bro you like music Go be my don't collect CDs though CDs will actually like they wear out like they'll just start flaking and they're dead.

265
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:25,000
Scott: no, but there are people who are I see this in kpop a lot is they'll produce albums where they have like Photobooks and a big, you know, it won't be in a plastic jewel case It's like a big cardboard thing with all sorts of shit in there.

266
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,967
Scott: Yeah actors crap, right sort of like.

267
00:21:26,987 --> 00:21:32,727
Scott: I used to buy anime DVDs and they would come with plush plushies Underwear and action figures.

268
00:21:32,768 --> 00:21:33,310
Rym: Where is it?

269
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,220
Rym: I still got the eye of Vogler somewhere, right?

270
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:35,884
Scott: That kind of thing.

271
00:21:35,924 --> 00:21:38,100
Scott: So imagine if albums all came in eye of Vogler.

272
00:21:38,421 --> 00:21:39,445
Scott: that's what kpop is like.

273
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:43,581
Scott: so you'll buy them if you're a fan of that group and you won't listen to the music on the CD.

274
00:21:43,641 --> 00:21:48,561
Scott: you stream the music or watch it on YouTube right to get views up here to make Popular.

275
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:56,293
Scott: but you know people buy those to collect them as things just to have things because they're materialistic collecting people who I guess That's not good.

276
00:21:57,188 --> 00:22:05,266
Rym: yep, so It's kind of amazing that this long tail lasted so long as people buy in CDs and Surprised it was worth the shelf space.

277
00:22:05,527 --> 00:22:12,440
Rym: I think it's partly that it takes a long time for retail like big retail Organizations to change anything that they're doing.

278
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,968
Rym: Yeah Cuz I'm sure there's some whole workflow around.

279
00:22:16,008 --> 00:22:21,023
Rym: like CDs get shipped in bulk and then like with comics and things some things can't be Shipped back.

280
00:22:21,225 --> 00:22:23,280
Scott: and I was like about CEO best buy right?

281
00:22:23,381 --> 00:22:29,449
Scott: When was the last time I Scott bought or listened to music on a CD?

282
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:33,628
Scott: probably sometime in Beacon before when I had the car before.

283
00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:36,660
Rym: it's the last time my car my CD player didn't work in my car at any point.

284
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,179
Scott: We lived before I plug the I've got the thing to plug the iPod into the car.

285
00:22:41,581 --> 00:22:53,680
Scott: I use CDs in the car right as soon as I stopped using CDs period Which is I guess 10 plus years ago 2004 I think is the last time I listened to music from a red book CD, right?

286
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,342
Scott: Something like that.

287
00:22:54,362 --> 00:22:55,708
Scott: That's when they should have stopped selling them.

288
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,460
Scott: as soon as you stop using them like, huh?

289
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:06,600
Rym: I'm the CEO of Best Buy Because you should stop selling these if you are wealthier you're probably an early adopter.

290
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:12,640
Rym: I mean my family actually like we Reinvested and saved and bought a CD player in the early days to add to the high-five system.

291
00:23:13,441 --> 00:23:24,151
Rym: Anyone, you know use the CD but tapes continued to be sold and popular for a long time After CDs were introduced and I didn't even know.

292
00:23:24,211 --> 00:23:25,977
Scott: I didn't even know who's still buying DVDs and blu-rays.

293
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:26,880
Scott: I'd stop selling those.

294
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,346
Rym: Yeah, a lot of people.

295
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:29,631
Rym: I see them in my Anna Twitter feed.

296
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:32,040
Scott: Mostly I think they're doing the collectors item biz.

297
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,006
Scott: I don't think they're actually.

298
00:23:33,428 --> 00:23:33,690
Rym: actually.

299
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:46,769
Rym: a lot of them are buying shows and Then laughing at people later when those shows are taken off a streaming platforms And there's literally nowhere to watch them and the physical media is sold out and you try to pirate them and like they're not even Easily pirated cuz no one gave a shit.

300
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:49,302
Scott: if no one gives a shit then that's not a show We're not?

301
00:23:49,322 --> 00:23:53,907
Rym: I need to see yeah, but I thought like I thought name a show I is.

302
00:23:54,028 --> 00:23:59,593
Rym: I couldn't find an easy Torrent of my hood sky tie the original you have that I already.

303
00:23:59,613 --> 00:24:01,600
Rym: yet cuz I pirated it and I kept it.

304
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,905
Rym: What if I hadn't kept it?

305
00:24:03,146 --> 00:24:06,318
Rym: and today I was like man, I should really watch my hood sky time.

306
00:24:06,358 --> 00:24:06,880
Rym: Good luck with them.

307
00:24:07,042 --> 00:24:15,960
Rym: Yeah, might be tough But anyway things of the day.

308
00:24:16,584 --> 00:24:19,260
Rym: So this video is called why the metric system matters.

309
00:24:19,361 --> 00:24:22,638
Rym: But what it really is about is it talks about a bunch of different like?

310
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,840
Rym: Measuring and counting systems and a bunch of historical stuff.

311
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:37,315
Rym: It's a pretty good video goes a little more depth than a lot of you probably encountered before but it explains something That I didn't really know and I realized that no one around me seems to know.

312
00:24:37,335 --> 00:24:40,951
Rym: so Scott American shoe sizes.

313
00:24:41,516 --> 00:24:43,358
Rym: Mm-hmm How the fuck do they work?

314
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,339
Scott: They're just slightly different from the European ones like half half up.

315
00:24:48,364 --> 00:24:56,454
Rym: Europe uses pretty much just metric now number of centimeters There's like no the UK ones were half up from yeah, cuz you just know the US are you.

316
00:24:56,755 --> 00:24:58,280
Rym: but anyway, why?

317
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,206
Rym: What what is a 10 mean?

318
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:01,733
Rym: and what versus a 10 and a half like?

319
00:25:01,753 --> 00:25:03,159
Rym: what is that system based on?

320
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:10,340
Scott: Probably they was probably someone's foot and they were like well that foot is X and there's probably something cobblers did and measured with.

321
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:13,997
Scott: So funny that my thing of the day also involves cobbling.

322
00:25:14,198 --> 00:25:23,086
Rym: oh, yeah because I actually like the American system for purely selfish selfish reasons because my shoe size is Exactly a u.s.

323
00:25:23,086 --> 00:25:24,231
Rym: 10 and a half.

324
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:26,380
Scott: mine change mine depends on the shoe company.

325
00:25:26,701 --> 00:25:27,524
Scott: It's like if it's a Nike.

326
00:25:27,545 --> 00:25:31,541
Scott: shoe is usually 12, but like some other companies could be 11 11.

327
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:33,246
Rym: I mean if I buy quality shoes like.

328
00:25:33,287 --> 00:25:36,277
Rym: I don't buy shoes from weird places, but I think I bought.

329
00:25:36,297 --> 00:25:37,180
Scott: I bought some dress shoes.

330
00:25:38,282 --> 00:25:40,571
Rym: My ten and a half is like spot-on.

331
00:25:40,611 --> 00:25:50,267
Rym: it's always different from different company, but That system is actually based on a specific unit of measure Called the barley corn.

332
00:25:50,287 --> 00:25:50,929
Rym: Okay.

333
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:51,611
Rym: It's how many?

334
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,360
Rym: I guess it's how many barley corns long your foot is.

335
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,365
Rym: Anyway, this video is pretty interesting.

336
00:25:56,445 --> 00:25:57,588
Scott: I'll use barley corns.

337
00:25:58,109 --> 00:26:02,600
Rym: Uh, yeah, it's American shoe sizes much like American acres.

338
00:26:03,303 --> 00:26:12,638
Rym: Seem to be based on some of the oldest units of measure that are still in common use today Because we have these like meta systems that are actually based on these old systems.

339
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:12,999
Scott: Mm-hmm.

340
00:26:13,862 --> 00:26:15,500
Rym: Anyway, so what's your shoe related thing?

341
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,028
Scott: So I found out about.

342
00:26:17,168 --> 00:26:22,401
Scott: you know, I've always thought like hey, you know There used to be cobblers about but now there aren't really cobblers Like.

343
00:26:22,421 --> 00:26:28,200
Scott: the only cobbling that goes on these days is like shoe shining replace shoelaces and maybe replace a soul and that's about it.

344
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:35,030
Scott: I mean I had some Birkenstocks and I wanted to get him fixed and usually in the city It'll be like shoe and watch repair place.

345
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:42,817
Scott: the cobbler wanted like 80% of the price of new shoes And whatever all-in-one anyway, so I was like you can't really.

346
00:26:43,138 --> 00:26:46,760
Scott: I always thought well You can't really cobble like sneakers the shoes that people actually wear, right?

347
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,620
Scott: It's pretty much just dress shoes and boots and stuff.

348
00:26:48,660 --> 00:27:00,120
Scott: But I would have thought without this video who even cares you buy another whatever the current Nike is and just move on Right, but no There's this kid in Chicago and I think his dad and also his grandpa were cobblers and he is also a cobbler.

349
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:09,307
Scott: He's the teen cobbler almost like a superhero teen cobbler and he may has a store called fix yo kicks Which is fucking awesome.

350
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:17,110
Rym: I did not take into account the people who want to keep their old Non leather shoes together.

351
00:27:17,331 --> 00:27:19,240
Scott: sneakers are a big craze for the past.

352
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,928
Scott: You know X years right.

353
00:27:20,968 --> 00:27:23,600
Rym: or if you live in the rest of the country tennis shoes anyway.

354
00:27:24,835 --> 00:27:29,718
Scott: and or kicks Kid in Chicago you bring him like your Jordans for the 90s.

355
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:34,820
Scott: He'll make them look new even though they're from the 90s or whatever and it's like that's fucking awesome.

356
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,867
Scott: I wish I had that kid.

357
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,760
Scott: Yeah, I hope it's cheaper to bring him.

358
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,448
Scott: You know, I guess you're only bringing shoes to him.

359
00:27:39,488 --> 00:27:42,803
Scott: if they're you know, ultra rare coca beans I would take him cuz.

360
00:27:42,823 --> 00:27:45,555
Rym: I got my Nike like for whatever free running shoes.

361
00:27:45,575 --> 00:27:46,600
Scott: I don't know if you can fix those.

362
00:27:46,921 --> 00:27:51,460
Rym: Yeah, I'd be curious because the new ones are great for running but there was one.

363
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,927
Scott: It'd be cheaper to just buy new ones.

364
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:53,751
Rym: Oh, yeah, but they're different.

365
00:27:53,771 --> 00:27:54,958
Rym: I wear them for running.

366
00:27:54,998 --> 00:27:55,400
Rym: I wear them out.

367
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,298
Rym: I don't care what they look like.

368
00:27:56,801 --> 00:28:03,942
Rym: But there was one year where they looked really good and I got a pair of those that are not looking so great and you Can't get those anymore.

369
00:28:04,603 --> 00:28:05,766
Rym: If he could make those look good.

370
00:28:05,806 --> 00:28:07,189
Rym: I would pay a reasonable amount of money.

371
00:28:07,209 --> 00:28:09,928
Scott: Mm-hmm Yeah, that's kids.

372
00:28:10,008 --> 00:28:10,270
Scott: Awesome.

373
00:28:10,371 --> 00:28:21,050
Rym: Yeah in the meta moment The book club book is Emily Wilson's translation of the Odyssey by Homa Homa But really probably more by Emily Wilson, I'm guessing.

374
00:28:21,151 --> 00:28:23,679
Scott: well, I don't know how much is how much is what?

375
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:25,809
Rym: well It's a new interpretation.

376
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,940
Scott: Yeah, we'll discuss that when we do the book club.

377
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,735
Rym: Yeah, the previous book club book is it's still on.

378
00:28:30,755 --> 00:28:46,373
Rym: the website was Nk jemisin is the fifth season and I just want to reiterate again If you didn't read that book you should go back and read it because the fifth season and the trilogy it's part of is real fucking good and More and more people around me are reading it because the book club.

379
00:28:46,634 --> 00:28:47,318
Rym: so you should too.

380
00:28:47,961 --> 00:28:52,596
Rym: Otherwise if you saw us at PAX Unplugged the video of our talk is on YouTube.

381
00:28:53,018 --> 00:28:56,828
Rym: if you saw us impact South the video of our talk is on YouTube.

382
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:02,122
Rym: if you saw us at magfest the video of one of our talks is on YouTube.

383
00:29:02,764 --> 00:29:09,625
Rym: and if you a long time ago saw our judge anime by its cover and anime Boston the video of us doing it At Scott's apartment for the fall 2017 season.

384
00:29:09,645 --> 00:29:10,087
Rym: anime winter 2018.

385
00:29:10,087 --> 00:29:10,468
Rym: Oh, yeah winter 2018.

386
00:29:10,468 --> 00:29:11,171
Rym: This is one older.

387
00:29:14,342 --> 00:29:15,288
Rym: Anyway, it is on YouTube.

388
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:16,253
Scott: the fall 2017 also is on YouTube.

389
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,739
Rym: That's all of these are on YouTube and you can enjoy them.

390
00:29:23,231 --> 00:29:32,427
Rym: So We haven't actually talked about like how hard drives work in the modern era as far as a consumer would care like Episode and SSDs.

391
00:29:32,467 --> 00:29:33,130
Scott: I don't remember.

392
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:33,934
Rym: pretty sure we did.

393
00:29:33,994 --> 00:29:35,420
Rym: we I'll dig some of that up.

394
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,008
Scott: I mean we can just briefly go over right?

395
00:29:37,028 --> 00:29:38,918
Scott: So when I first built a computer it was ATA.

396
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:47,485
Scott: You had a ribbon cable and a molex 4-pin connector that went into that hard drive and spinning magnetic platters and read heads That would zip across them.

397
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,720
Scott: Right and that was a hard drive and there was no other kind of hard drive.

398
00:29:50,981 --> 00:29:51,463
Scott: that was it.

399
00:29:51,884 --> 00:29:54,353
Scott: and they were slow and they got faster over time.

400
00:29:54,393 --> 00:30:01,840
Scott: and they changed it from IDE to SAT and SAT was better because it was faster and it didn't use a stupid ribbon cable used a much smaller cable.

401
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,582
Scott: That was way better.

402
00:30:02,883 --> 00:30:05,530
Scott: Yep, and it was cereal in general.

403
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:26,759
Rym: There's been a move away from at least outside of Tightly controlled environments like on your motherboard with CPUs and everything, but you move to Serial interfaces for connectivity to slower things as opposed to parallel because it's really hard to keep those bits in sync in Parallel unless you can parallelize the workflow which for hard drives until recently you could not do

404
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:27,200
Scott: anyway.

405
00:30:27,361 --> 00:30:30,917
Scott: So then we had to SAT a and there's also a better power connector.

406
00:30:30,977 --> 00:30:32,223
Scott: not and it was smaller.

407
00:30:32,283 --> 00:30:35,277
Scott: and you can get smaller drives because the connectors are smaller.

408
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:37,752
Scott: and you know The drives got better and so on.

409
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:41,167
Scott: and then you know The idea of the SSD was always there.

410
00:30:41,228 --> 00:30:44,739
Scott: people would like get a ton of RAM which meant like 32 megabytes of RAM.

411
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,356
Scott: Yeah, and they would make a RAM drive, right?

412
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:56,740
Scott: That would only last while the computer was on but they tried to keep the computer on a long time You know or people would get a whole bunch of RAM sticks and put them on a PCI card and make a drive.

413
00:30:57,041 --> 00:31:05,320
Scott: You know out of RAM, you know some way because it's you know, it's solid-state storage meaning You know magnets is not solid-state, right?

414
00:31:05,581 --> 00:31:09,414
Scott: It's it's a chip, you know that we're like an SD card.

415
00:31:09,454 --> 00:31:11,220
Scott: that's solid-state like flash storage.

416
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:13,991
Scott: All right, if you want to know what's actually happening there.

417
00:31:14,392 --> 00:31:15,838
Scott: It's like you had to go look that up.

418
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:17,145
Scott: I'm sorry That's not what the show's about.

419
00:31:17,226 --> 00:31:17,447
Scott: Yep.

420
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:19,339
Scott: Also, I can't explain it to ya

421
00:31:20,603 --> 00:31:38,990
Rym: and what's interesting is actually this stuff in general like This the protocols and how things work and like all the details have actually gotten way More complex around PC storage than they were back when I paid attention because I was like Meticulously researching how to build PCs.

422
00:31:39,151 --> 00:31:45,300
Scott: Yep, but eventually we had SSDs But they were crazy expensive and small and they're still more expensive and have less storage.

423
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:52,746
Scott: You still sometimes need magnet drives if you need a ton of storage like terabytes, but we have the SSDs now They're the size of laptop hard drives.

424
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,834
Scott: They connect to that same SATA.

425
00:31:54,854 --> 00:31:58,588
Scott: It goes up to six gigabits per second You know and that's still.

426
00:31:58,628 --> 00:32:02,566
Scott: we got and it's still great and people still use it But it wasn't fast enough.

427
00:32:02,606 --> 00:32:07,200
Scott: We sorted the SATA couldn't really get any faster even though the SSDs could go faster.

428
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:13,519
Scott: So on your computer on your motherboard this PCI Express slots and no one's really using those except to hold video cards.

429
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,127
Rym: now It's interesting.

430
00:32:14,148 --> 00:32:21,960
Rym: remember in the old day There was ISA and PCI and AGP and all these slots where you could use a protocol to connect things to your computer.

431
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:28,300
Rym: Yep, generic things like a card that does USB or a sound card or a video card or a network card.

432
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,160
Rym: Yeah, you're putting a board in your computer that gives you shit.

433
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:36,562
Scott: But now they slowly added all those things to the CPU and the motherboard and the bridge North bridge the South bridge Whatever.

434
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:38,252
Scott: So now your motherboard has a sound card.

435
00:32:38,273 --> 00:32:39,460
Scott: You don't put a sound card in there.

436
00:32:39,581 --> 00:32:41,520
Scott: Yeah, your motherboard has like one or two network ports.

437
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,059
Scott: You don't add a network card.

438
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:48,920
Scott: So like the motherboards even mini ICX ones have like fucking everything on them and no one needed to put cards.

439
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,046
Scott: You know everyone used USB.

440
00:32:50,066 --> 00:32:51,695
Scott: They didn't need a game card to connect.

441
00:32:51,715 --> 00:32:53,783
Scott: their game can tell again USB.

442
00:32:54,064 --> 00:32:59,740
Rym: the big deal with USB is that it was a serial protocol as opposed to a parallel protocol.

443
00:32:59,941 --> 00:33:02,891
Scott: We stopped needing to use those slots.

444
00:33:03,071 --> 00:33:05,680
Scott: So some people got a bunch of video cards.

445
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,247
Scott: Yeah, cuz they had too much money.

446
00:33:07,549 --> 00:33:09,980
Rym: Some people like me have a firewire card or something weird.

447
00:33:10,261 --> 00:33:13,520
Scott: Yeah, but most people put in one video card and had a bunch of empty slots.

448
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:16,410
Scott: Yeah, so the thing is the way.

449
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:26,452
Scott: the way the PCI Express works is that it's crazy fast obviously, that's why your video card connects to it, but There's only so much bandwidth there just like anything else this bandwidth.

450
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:28,520
Scott: You couldn't put a hundred video cards in there.

451
00:33:28,681 --> 00:33:31,099
Scott: They wouldn't be enough, you know bits to go around, right?

452
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,700
Rym: Yep, so now not to get into the details just kind of beyond the scope of this.

453
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:40,989
Rym: But that's why you'll see like you plug in one video card and it runs at 16 But if you would in two, it's eight and eight.

454
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:41,491
Scott: Yep.

455
00:33:42,094 --> 00:33:47,873
Scott: Anyway, so What they call this is what channels you have so many PCI channels something like that.

456
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,759
Scott: I forget what it is lanes.

457
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:51,498
Scott: lanes That's what they call it lanes.

458
00:33:52,142 --> 00:34:05,125
Scott: So your motherboard and your CPU have so a limited number of PCI lanes and you can only you know Once you've used those lanes up you can't add any more cards or anything else to use PCI Express Even if you got vacant slots, right?

459
00:34:05,827 --> 00:34:10,820
Scott: So they're like, well, that's faster than SAT a. why don't we go borrow some of them?

460
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:11,607
Scott: They're lanes.

461
00:34:11,768 --> 00:34:15,849
Scott: so you could get Solid-state drives that plug in the PCI Express slot.

462
00:34:16,069 --> 00:34:19,060
Scott: Yeah, that's kind of silly, but it works and it's really fast.

463
00:34:19,301 --> 00:34:28,280
Rym: So, okay sure and there's all these other ways to do fast storage that are Enterprise only server only way beyond the scope of what we're gonna talk about today, right?

464
00:34:28,621 --> 00:34:29,362
Scott: But what eventually?

465
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:33,815
Scott: what they currently have the latest and greatest technology is the m.2 slot.

466
00:34:34,117 --> 00:34:35,120
Rym: now, this is important.

467
00:34:35,221 --> 00:34:41,572
Rym: This is kind of why we're doing this show a lot of people Confused thinking because SATA was sort of.

468
00:34:41,592 --> 00:34:50,120
Rym: I mean there were all their form factors for SATA But SATA for all intents and purposes was both the form factor for the cabling and the protocol.

469
00:34:50,302 --> 00:34:52,223
Scott: Yeah up until now It was pretty much.

470
00:34:52,565 --> 00:34:56,100
Scott: you plug stuff in where it fits and it works and you don't have to think about it.

471
00:34:57,081 --> 00:35:11,480
Scott: M2 it makes, you know configuring the PC and the storage a little weird Compared to before and there's like a lot of weird stuff going on that you won't know unless you've been educated because m.2 is Literally just the form factor.

472
00:35:12,002 --> 00:35:13,667
Rym: They basically needed a way.

473
00:35:14,008 --> 00:35:18,344
Rym: the fact that you're like hard drives were pretty big in the old days and the old days They're even bigger.

474
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:22,544
Rym: but nowadays if it's not a spinning disk It's really just.

475
00:35:22,584 --> 00:35:23,488
Rym: it can be a like.

476
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:26,580
Rym: look at a micro SD card like storage can be really tiny.

477
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,790
Scott: They have a micro SD cards at like 512 megabytes.

478
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:30,840
Scott: Yeah, it's like holy shit.

479
00:35:31,182 --> 00:35:40,948
Rym: so it's like it's like smaller than a cornflake, but the Form factor of plugging in like SATA or all these other ways Didn't really make sense.

480
00:35:41,169 --> 00:35:43,560
Rym: to have just like this tiny little chip sticking out of the end.

481
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,913
Scott: You open up your solid-state drive and it's like two and a half inches.

482
00:35:46,974 --> 00:35:47,556
Scott: you look inside.

483
00:35:47,576 --> 00:35:48,480
Scott: There's almost nothing in there.

484
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:56,073
Rym: Yep, and for most people who aren't building a giant desktop computer because desktops really are not like workstations are not a thing for most People anymore.

485
00:35:56,257 --> 00:35:58,640
Rym: Nope You want you wanted a form factor?

486
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,497
Rym: To be able to just put a hard drive into some small computer in a modern way.

487
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:04,160
Rym: that made sense.

488
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:08,209
Scott: Yeah for the way computers are used today It's like other than the power supply in the video card.

489
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,920
Scott: literally the motherboard in the CPU is the whole computer.

490
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,839
Scott: So you could get mini ITX computers and like make really flat cases if you could somehow get rid of that stuff.

491
00:36:16,879 --> 00:36:23,680
Scott: and the hard Drive, you know, even the two and a half inch SSDs We're you know, really gumming up the works in terms of making the flat computer.

492
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:29,680
Rym: So as a result, my hard drive is smaller than one of my RAM chips and it's just plugged into the light.

493
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:34,100
Scott: It's like it's like a stick of gum, but slightly bigger maybe like smaller than a bookmark.

494
00:36:35,563 --> 00:36:36,069
Scott: It's small.

495
00:36:36,211 --> 00:36:36,312
Scott: Yep.

496
00:36:36,332 --> 00:36:37,000
Scott: All right.

497
00:36:37,421 --> 00:36:42,137
Scott: So m2 refers to just the physical slot on the motherboard that these things go into.

498
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:42,840
Scott: right.

499
00:36:43,361 --> 00:36:45,928
Scott: Well, it's which is separate from what it's actually doing.

500
00:36:46,008 --> 00:36:55,107
Scott: so an m2 slot and most motherboards you're gonna buy today can actually work either in SATA mode or PCI Express mode.

501
00:36:55,127 --> 00:36:56,833
Scott: so you plug a thing into it a drive.

502
00:36:56,853 --> 00:36:58,319
Scott: you get an m2 drive and plug it in.

503
00:36:58,881 --> 00:37:03,200
Scott: That drive might be using SATA or it might be using PCI Express.

504
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:07,896
Rym: This is why you gotta read the manual for your motherboard and the specs.

505
00:37:07,957 --> 00:37:11,530
Scott: if you're buying the drive You might buy a drive that doesn't do PCI Express.

506
00:37:11,571 --> 00:37:12,193
Scott: you plug it in.

507
00:37:12,253 --> 00:37:13,840
Scott: it's only going at SATA speed.

508
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:17,080
Scott: You might as well just plugged it into the SATA port with the cable.

509
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:21,597
Scott: It's not really getting anything by being plugged directly into that m2 slot.

510
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:24,044
Rym: Yep So even even better.

511
00:37:24,565 --> 00:37:30,018
Rym: so a lot of motherboards like they'll advertise like they'll even have multiple m.2 slots like yeah m.2 raid.

512
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:36,120
Rym: Usually if there's more than one it's because it's just say to using the m.2 form factor.

513
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:40,359
Scott: No, no, I seen drive motherboards where you can put in two real PCI.

514
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:43,593
Rym: I have but but I've also seen a lot that pointedly we're not.

515
00:37:43,653 --> 00:37:44,015
Scott: it's gonna be.

516
00:37:44,035 --> 00:37:45,140
Scott: it's gonna be in the cheaper end.

517
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:51,385
Scott: Right if you get a cheapo motherboard that looks like it has too many m2s for a cheap motherboard then Probably something's up with that.

518
00:37:51,405 --> 00:37:52,229
Scott: You got to read the specs.

519
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:54,300
Scott: Anyway, there's another thing going on.

520
00:37:54,380 --> 00:38:03,019
Scott: It's tricky which is you plug in an m2 drive and even if it's in PCI Express mode It's linked up to some of the SATA ports.

521
00:38:03,463 --> 00:38:12,200
Scott: So if you also have SATA drives Plugging in something into one of the m2 ports might disable some of the SATA ports that match up with that one.

522
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:20,438
Scott: Yep, so it's like oh if I plug in something to m2 slot one SATA slots one and two become disabled and you can't plug anything into.

523
00:38:20,478 --> 00:38:20,800
Scott: oh my god.

524
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:25,757
Rym: I was about to make an analogy but then I realized that kids today probably wouldn't even know what this is.

525
00:38:25,777 --> 00:38:31,500
Rym: but on Network gear in the older days you'd have a bunch of ports.

526
00:38:31,861 --> 00:38:36,700
Rym: You can plug your stuff into like plug computer one computers you computer three, then you had on uplink port.

527
00:38:37,384 --> 00:38:46,259
Rym: That's where you plug the switch or the router or the hub Into your other switch or router or cable modem or whatever like the upstream stuff.

528
00:38:46,982 --> 00:38:49,150
Rym: Usually there was one port.

529
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:51,939
Rym: like you'd have ports one two and three were like for plugging stuff in.

530
00:38:52,381 --> 00:38:54,350
Rym: Then you'd have port four and the uplink port.

531
00:38:54,691 --> 00:38:57,523
Rym: if you plug something into the uplink port it Cannibalized.

532
00:38:57,584 --> 00:38:59,372
Rym: port four is one or the other not both.

533
00:38:59,633 --> 00:38:59,874
Scott: Yeah.

534
00:39:00,035 --> 00:39:02,285
Scott: Yeah, but it's like yeah You have to play it's.

535
00:39:02,426 --> 00:39:03,511
Scott: it's a weird situation.

536
00:39:03,531 --> 00:39:05,440
Scott: It's like you think well, I got ten plugs here, right?

537
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,460
Scott: I can use all ten of them.

538
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,057
Scott: It's like no actually if you use that one, it borrows bandwidth for that one.

539
00:39:10,177 --> 00:39:10,760
Scott: You can't use it.

540
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,965
Scott: You can't use both of these at once.

541
00:39:12,206 --> 00:39:12,909
Scott: Yeah one of the other.

542
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,336
Rym: so my motherboard supports both.

543
00:39:14,376 --> 00:39:20,340
Rym: so I can tell it Hey, I'm gonna put us say to drive in this m2 and then there's one say to port that I just can't use.

544
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,404
Rym: It's got a different color on it.

545
00:39:21,544 --> 00:39:28,100
Rym: Yeah, or I can tell it that's an NVMe PCIe card and it says yes Sir, your Sata port is ready and available.

546
00:39:28,264 --> 00:39:29,322
Scott: Yeah, it's you know you got it.

547
00:39:29,422 --> 00:39:36,429
Scott: you got to make sure you know you're aware of this before you just start plugging stuff in because it'll tell you Like which ports become disabled and stuff like that, right?

548
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:36,850
Rym: Now.

549
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:41,879
Rym: What's funny is I gotta remember how old I am because AHCI.

550
00:39:41,899 --> 00:39:50,126
Rym: I Remember that being the new way to do things and then I just noticed I'm looking at the Wikipedia here in addition to supporting Legacy AHCI.

551
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:51,972
Scott: Yeah, it's NVMe now, right?

552
00:39:52,012 --> 00:39:52,955
Rym: Yeah NVMe.

553
00:39:52,975 --> 00:40:03,017
Rym: I forget what this stands for NVMe Express, okay Non-volatile memory host controller interface to NVM HCIS.

554
00:40:03,238 --> 00:40:06,446
Rym: Yeah the To deal with all that shit.

555
00:40:06,908 --> 00:40:09,295
Rym: This is kind of why this is really interesting.

556
00:40:09,496 --> 00:40:17,263
Rym: Is that Sata and enable PETA like parallel like old IDE with the parallel channels like, you know the big ribbon cable?

557
00:40:17,845 --> 00:40:25,312
Rym: it only had all those channels to try to push a lot of data as fast as possible and More wires was just better back in the old days.

558
00:40:25,392 --> 00:40:25,754
Rym: nowadays.

559
00:40:25,874 --> 00:40:26,879
Rym: One wire is usually better.

560
00:40:27,362 --> 00:40:35,260
Rym: Serialized transactions can generally be scaled better anyway But hard drives could not execute parallel instructions.

561
00:40:36,043 --> 00:40:37,548
Rym: Because there's a spinning platter.

562
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,137
Scott: the needle can read like one spot at a time.

563
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:45,360
Rym: Maybe Maybe they could be as long as the data was formed the right way.

564
00:40:45,761 --> 00:40:50,220
Rym: They could be writing onto one side of one platter and reading onto part of another platter.

565
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,900
Scott: I don't know that is the inside of a hard drive.

566
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,783
Rym: That is not.

567
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:57,420
Rym: even if that existed that is not something you could take advantage of or be scalable.

568
00:40:57,801 --> 00:41:24,027
Rym: the reality was that hard drives could effectively just queue up operations, but couldn't have been parallel and early Sata SSDs Were pretty much the same way because even though they were a solid-state drive internally Which theoretically could be engineered to have parallel read and write operations you Wanted it to be compatible with the way hard drives plugged into computers So it just plugged into Sata.

569
00:41:24,288 --> 00:41:26,959
Rym: so even if the drive supported it your computer couldn't support that.

570
00:41:27,882 --> 00:41:38,207
Rym: as far as I can tell NVMe allows for the idea that you have a drive that could have parallel I/O and Take advantage of that right?

571
00:41:38,227 --> 00:41:42,905
Scott: It's like you plug in a drive to Sata and it's like sure You know it you you can.

572
00:41:43,025 --> 00:41:47,760
Scott: it can tell the computer that this is a solid-state drive and not a hard not a magnetic drive.

573
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,193
Scott: The computer the operating system can account for that to a certain extent.

574
00:41:51,274 --> 00:42:03,340
Scott: right treat it slightly differently But it's still speaking the same state of protocol There's only so far it can go to treat it differently Right by plugging it into something different and being like this is definitely not a magnetic drive.

575
00:42:03,441 --> 00:42:05,734
Scott: This is definitely solid-state storage.

576
00:42:05,935 --> 00:42:17,317
Scott: with these capabilities You can take full advantage of those Capabilities and not using a protocol that was designed for a hard drive with a big spinning platter that you know Spun around with a motor yep.

577
00:42:18,242 --> 00:42:20,914
Rym: So NVMe or NVM Express or you'll see.

578
00:42:21,095 --> 00:42:22,240
Rym: people refer to different ways.

579
00:42:22,762 --> 00:42:26,476
Rym: That's the thing if you buy like one of those Intel solid-state drives.

580
00:42:26,516 --> 00:42:28,081
Rym: That's just a PCI card Mm-hmm.

581
00:42:28,402 --> 00:42:29,726
Rym: well PCIe card yeah,

582
00:42:30,168 --> 00:42:43,280
Scott: so another thing you might be confused about is when you're shopping for m2 drives You'll see all these numbers like 2280 and 22 something else and all these numbers like it's like what the hell are all these numbers And like the motherboard will list like four different numbers and the you know.

583
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,858
Scott: But the drive will only have one number and of course common sense you just go.

584
00:42:47,019 --> 00:42:55,716
Scott: okay I'll just make sure the number on the drive matches one of the compatible numbers in the motherboard and you're good to go which is true, but it's important to know what that number means.

585
00:42:55,776 --> 00:42:59,809
Scott: that number is Literally just the size and shape of the m2 drive.

586
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:02,096
Scott: 22 is the width and the height.

587
00:43:02,256 --> 00:43:03,420
Scott: the length of it is you know?

588
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,420
Rym: The other number 80 every now and then the standard make sense.

589
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:14,986
Scott: I said 2280 is like those sort of is the normal size for most of them that you're gonna get these days like the Samsung 850s or whatever like the Evo's.

590
00:43:15,247 --> 00:43:16,371
Scott: those are 2280.

591
00:43:16,371 --> 00:43:16,992
Scott: I'm pretty sure.

592
00:43:17,153 --> 00:43:18,758
Scott: now in the old days if you see one.

593
00:43:18,778 --> 00:43:22,066
Scott: That's like 2240. well you know it's a short stubby one.

594
00:43:22,427 --> 00:43:29,940
Rym: now in the old days with like ISA and PCI like the old things you'd plug into computers They didn't really have that much of a tight tolerance.

595
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,972
Rym: And how big the things like there were rules about how big things could actually be.

596
00:43:33,032 --> 00:43:35,622
Rym: but like some video cards would just be Longer.

597
00:43:35,742 --> 00:43:40,657
Rym: you just had to know and take it into account and the tolerances weren't that big as computer cases were big.

598
00:43:40,998 --> 00:43:46,936
Rym: the whole point Of m2 is to be able to build very space efficient computers.

599
00:43:47,378 --> 00:43:57,294
Rym: so the Specifications and the way you refer to these things encoded those sizes Directly like this because people care a lot about how many millimeters wide something.

600
00:43:57,315 --> 00:43:58,479
Scott: well you'll see on the motherboard.

601
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:02,133
Scott: usually They'll be the m2 connector and then one screw and then another screw.

602
00:44:02,214 --> 00:44:04,193
Scott: so if it allows for the longer one Yeah, right.

603
00:44:04,521 --> 00:44:08,157
Scott: And that's that you you're only gonna put one screw in there and the way you install it is real simple.

604
00:44:08,498 --> 00:44:19,777
Scott: you put in The end with the clips into the into the slot you push it down and get flat against the motherboard Top or some of them go on the bottom of the motherboard Yeah, which is cool, and then you put in the one screw, and you're good to go.

605
00:44:19,837 --> 00:44:20,159
Scott: It's great.

606
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:24,634
Rym: No, I can slide one into my nose up there if I was separate power connectors.

607
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:25,537
Scott: No nothing okay.

608
00:44:25,578 --> 00:44:29,237
Scott: now one more thing You got to know is like this is a B business.

609
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:38,520
Rym: luckily This doesn't like you don't have to worry about it as much because it's kind of like in the old days with AGP Like whether or not you had the tab for the voltages and everything.

610
00:44:39,402 --> 00:44:42,862
Scott: You don't to worry about this too much, but it's also good to know yeah Is that so?

611
00:44:43,063 --> 00:44:47,859
Scott: on the connector part is a little notch and some have the notch on the left B?

612
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:59,765
Scott: Some have the notch on the right them some have the both not just being M. Yep, so you'll see a drive will be like B. Plus M. That means that on the connector part It's got two notches on it.

613
00:45:00,247 --> 00:45:02,615
Scott: You just got to make sure it fits in your mother part.

614
00:45:02,735 --> 00:45:03,658
Scott: It's probably gonna fit.

615
00:45:03,879 --> 00:45:05,023
Rym: yep I'm pretty sure.

616
00:45:05,223 --> 00:45:17,016
Scott: pretty much all the motherboards have B, and if you buy a modern motherboard from you know aces a asrock Gigabyte whoever right and you buy a Samsung Evo m2 is gonna fit.

617
00:45:17,517 --> 00:45:18,280
Scott: it's gonna be just fine.

618
00:45:18,743 --> 00:45:20,860
Rym: It's sort of interesting that this is the kind of thing where?

619
00:45:22,001 --> 00:45:30,996
Rym: It matters for early adopters because there would be things that only supported certain kinds of yes Like when m2 is brand new everyone is still feeling it out.

620
00:45:31,056 --> 00:45:31,880
Scott: get a little bit now.

621
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:41,059
Rym: It's standardized you're good to go like AGP there was still there within the old days you could buy video cards that were AGP and try to plug them in your AGP core port and they just wouldn't fit.

622
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:47,176
Rym: and the assumption was the only people buying AGP video cards in that era were people who knew what they were doing.

623
00:45:47,617 --> 00:45:57,422
Rym: and then later the GP ports just supported every kind of AGP card mm-hmm, so I hope we demystified the deal with m2 Cuz.

624
00:45:57,744 --> 00:45:59,780
Scott: frankly it took me a while to figure it out.

625
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:03,034
Scott: Yeah, if you have those numbers somewhat recently.

626
00:46:03,074 --> 00:46:13,760
Scott: so if you have an existing computer You're just gonna buy a SATA hard drive or SSD or whatever and stick it in there still making new SSDs that are SATA, and they're still just great and still just fine and still crazy fast.

627
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:19,920
Scott: There's nothing wrong with those, but if you're building new computers Pretty much if you're gonna cost you a bit more to get an m2 drive.

628
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:24,609
Scott: So if you can't if you want to save money That's the first place to save money is to get the SSD.

629
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:32,620
Scott: that's goes SATA instead of m2 because for most Normal people doing normal stuff that difference you won't know your game is gonna load a little slow or whatever.

630
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:33,647
Rym: But I predict it'll.

631
00:46:33,949 --> 00:46:35,520
Scott: the SSDs are still crazy fast.

632
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,997
Scott: You could save like a hundred to two hundred dollars, but not going m2.

633
00:46:38,681 --> 00:46:43,759
Rym: Oh my HDPC probably got four more years of life just by replacing its old spinning disk with a regular old SSD.

634
00:46:44,241 --> 00:46:44,562
Scott: That is.

635
00:46:44,683 --> 00:46:48,260
Scott: one of the good thing about SATA is that you had your spinning disks hooked up to SATA.

636
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,079
Scott: now You can get an SSD play in the same hole.

637
00:46:50,702 --> 00:46:57,030
Rym: But I think it won't be long until the vast majority of computers if you buy or build one Even if it's still SATA you're gonna put.

638
00:46:57,091 --> 00:46:58,618
Rym: you're gonna have one hard drive is gonna be an m.2.

639
00:46:59,223 --> 00:47:02,065
Rym: Yeah, if you have two hard drives It's just gonna be two m.2s.

640
00:47:02,426 --> 00:47:07,624
Scott: and then the only other kinds of the main limitation is that the biggest m2s are like one Terabyte.

641
00:47:07,665 --> 00:47:12,390
Scott: I think I've seen some two terabyte ones But they cost on our as much as the whole computer.

642
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:15,461
Scott: like mine a one terabyte m2 is like $1,000.

643
00:47:15,461 --> 00:47:16,094
Scott: It's like fuck.

644
00:47:16,155 --> 00:47:18,428
Scott: no I have a 512 is like it.

645
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:25,784
Scott: the for the is the price for people who have money and the 256 is for the price of people who have More less money.

646
00:47:25,804 --> 00:47:31,590
Rym: Yep, but that's fine because if you need more space just add SSD That's much cheaper.

647
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:34,448
Rym: or add a magnetic drive Even if you need a lot of space.

648
00:47:34,468 --> 00:47:35,432
Scott: if you just got like thing about.

649
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:38,549
Scott: if you got a computer and it's like, okay I'll install windows in the m2.

650
00:47:38,931 --> 00:47:40,863
Scott: I'll install the gate the Applications.

651
00:47:40,903 --> 00:47:42,269
Scott: I use the most on the m2s.

652
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:47,660
Rym: they load real fast on the games my Adobe apps Whatever my other crap on just a cheap SSD that I played into it.

653
00:47:47,841 --> 00:47:52,686
Scott: But if you got all this stuff you could put it on an SSD and if you even want to save more money It's like okay.

654
00:47:52,726 --> 00:47:54,280
Scott: I got a huge video collection.

655
00:47:54,421 --> 00:47:56,932
Scott: You could put that on a magnetic drive and you wouldn't notice for shit.

656
00:47:57,234 --> 00:47:58,540
Rym: now the fun thing about magnetic drives.

657
00:47:58,861 --> 00:47:59,524
Rym: It's so cheap.

658
00:47:59,765 --> 00:48:01,633
Scott: You can get as well as massive.

659
00:48:01,653 --> 00:48:08,808
Rym: one might as well just buy two and raid them Like why not get an eight terabyte if you got money, but yeah You just get it by one if you don't have more.

660
00:48:08,828 --> 00:48:12,480
Rym: thereby four terabyte spinning discs ain't expensive?

661
00:48:12,801 --> 00:48:13,504
Scott: No, it's not.

662
00:48:13,584 --> 00:48:19,545
Scott: you can get a four terabyte like spinning magnetic disc for like less than a hundred bucks Probably way less than that.

663
00:48:19,666 --> 00:48:26,280
Scott: and meanwhile, you know a one term, you know to get four terabytes of m2 Storage is gonna cost you like five thousand.

664
00:48:27,601 --> 00:48:28,283
Scott: Right, you could.

665
00:48:28,725 --> 00:48:30,530
Scott: it's ridiculous the difference in price.

666
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:33,800
Scott: So yeah, the magnetic drive is not dead yet, right?

667
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:40,729
Rym: That's why you still the magnetic drive is the place is for if you have Terabytes of data that you want to start.

668
00:48:40,829 --> 00:48:44,240
Scott: people are not storing so much anymore because they use their streaming their music.

669
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:51,220
Scott: They're streaming their videos and most you know, yeah, maybe you got a photo collection You keep in the cloud on Google Photos and then you know stuff like that.

670
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:51,503
Scott: It's like.

671
00:48:51,544 --> 00:49:03,599
Scott: well now you're not storing anything But people who are still storing things people are storing photos locally people who are have videos downloaded or making videos usually creators Are gonna be stored right or you know anything like that?

672
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:10,524
Scott: Yeah, you might need to throw a magnet drive in there to get your storage up or just a NAS but that's still a magnet Drive is just in a different box.

673
00:49:10,605 --> 00:49:11,989
Scott: Yeah the box your computers in.

674
00:49:12,712 --> 00:49:17,870
Rym: so if you're building a computer in the near future You're probably have one hard drive for all your basic stuff.

675
00:49:17,891 --> 00:49:18,975
Scott: now, you know how the m2 goes.

676
00:49:19,015 --> 00:49:19,718
Rym: Yeah, it'll be an m.2.

677
00:49:25,794 --> 00:49:28,330
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

678
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:33,210
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

693
00:50:51,169 --> 00:50:58,420
Rym: and Yeah, I'm not gonna make a steamed hams cuz I feel like percent percent perfection has already been achieved.

694
00:50:58,783 --> 00:51:00,760
Rym: but anyway now I leave you with.
