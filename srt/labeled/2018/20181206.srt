1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,842
Rym: It's Thursday, December 6th, 2018.

2
00:00:12,842 --> 00:00:13,303
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,424 --> 00:00:13,905
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,006 --> 00:00:15,350
Rym: And this is GeekNights tonight.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,529
Rym: You guys love these fucking food shows, so we're talking about food we don't like.

6
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:21,550
Rym: Cuz it's Thursday.

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,048
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:25,752 --> 00:00:29,750
Rym: And of course, I got a picture of Burger King up here because that's way below the line of food I will eat.

9
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:31,464
Rym: So, uh, yeah.

10
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:34,196
Rym: Ski season has started up.

11
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:37,510
Rym: I might go skiing this weekend, my first ski trip of the year.

12
00:00:37,816 --> 00:00:38,410
Scott: Good luck with that.

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,770
Rym: And the one cool thing is, you know, I live in New York, of course.

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,390
Scott: Final episode of GeekNights, everybody.

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:51,150
Rym: And the deal with New York is that there is, in fact, pretty good skiing within a, like, a day trip of New York City.

16
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,750
Rym: Not good skiing, not great skiing, but, like, pretty good skiing.

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,976
Scott: There are mountains in New York State.

18
00:00:57,538 --> 00:00:58,220
Scott: It snows here.

19
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:01,050
Scott: It's north enough to be cold and snowy during half the year.

20
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:05,430
Rym: There are some mountains that are, like, a half hour away, but, like, there's literally no reason to go to them.

21
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,590
Rym: Like, that'd be like going to a roller coaster park that has one roller coaster.

22
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:10,596
Rym: Like, they're not.

23
00:01:10,818 --> 00:01:12,029
Rym: And, like, a crappy one at that.

24
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:17,670
Rym: But you get up north, the nearest mountains that are worth going to, there's Hunter Mountain and there's Wyndham Mountain.

25
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:20,317
Rym: I've gone to Wyndham Mountain twice in my life.

26
00:01:20,337 --> 00:01:23,830
Rym: That place is such a garbage, like, never go to Wyndham Mountain.

27
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:25,582
Rym: What a piece of shit mountain.

28
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,650
Scott: But... Is the actual mountain itself bad or just the company that owns the mountain is bad?

29
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,239
Rym: So the mountain itself is okay.

30
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:33,130
Rym: It's about equivalent size to Hunter Mountain.

31
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:36,630
Rym: It just has way less lift capacity, so it has way longer lines.

32
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:40,170
Scott: So what if you bought Wyndham Mountain and, like, upgraded it and made it fancy?

33
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:41,247
Rym: Yeah, except all the...

34
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,710
Scott: Like turning an old bowling alley into a disco night-night bowling alley.

35
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:53,689
Rym: So that could be possible, but basically the deal is that the investors who invest in this sector seem to have focused on Hunter Mountain, and Hunter Mountain...

36
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:55,350
Scott: Why are people investing in mountains?

37
00:01:56,231 --> 00:01:57,590
Rym: Ski resorts make a lot of money.

38
00:01:57,731 --> 00:01:59,130
Scott: How much money could they possibly make?

39
00:01:59,391 --> 00:02:01,069
Rym: Enough money to where Hunter Mountain...

40
00:02:01,211 --> 00:02:02,309
Scott: Only open part of the year.

41
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:04,669
Rym: Well, actually, they do stuff in the summer, too.

42
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,850
Scott: Well, they're always trying to do stuff out of season.

43
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,530
Rym: Yeah, they do, like, music festivals.

44
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,070
Scott: They're trying to do everything they can to make money from that real estate.

45
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:16,210
Rym: Actually, when I saw Meatloaf, it was at Pine Knob, which was the ski mountain I learned to ski on as a kid in Michigan.

46
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,450
Scott: I'm sure that's his most memorable performance.

47
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,750
Scott: Hey, Meatloaf, remember that time you put a concert at Pine Knob?

48
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:23,437
Rym: I'm pretty sure.

49
00:02:23,457 --> 00:02:24,065
Rym: what he would say is,

50
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:24,349
Rym: "What?".

51
00:02:25,952 --> 00:02:26,576
Rym: Is he still alive?

52
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:27,764
Scott: I haven't heard from him in a long time.

53
00:02:28,751 --> 00:02:30,550
Rym: I assume he is still performing.

54
00:02:31,211 --> 00:02:31,717
Rym: Let's see.

55
00:02:31,858 --> 00:02:32,162
Rym: Meat...

56
00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:34,429
Scott: I haven't heard from him in years.

57
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,269
Rym: He's not dead.

58
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,910
Scott: I haven't seen news that he's dead, so I assume that he's alive.

59
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,510
Scott: But I have not heard anything about him.

60
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:43,110
Rym: I would know if he was dead.

61
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,090
Scott: Just go to his Wikipedia page.

62
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,930
Rym: Yeah, I'm going to his Wikipedia to see if he is active.

63
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,599
Rym: Uh, year's active.

64
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,310
Rym: He's still active.

65
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:50,109
Scott: What is he doing?

66
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:50,928
Rym: Concerts.

67
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,253
Rym: Where?

68
00:02:51,273 --> 00:02:53,010
Scott: What was his last concert?

69
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:54,149
Rym: I'm gonna find out right now.

70
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,309
Rym: I'm gonna go to Google News.

71
00:02:56,475 --> 00:02:56,849
Rym: Let's see.

72
00:02:57,073 --> 00:02:58,090
Scott: What's his next concert?

73
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,840
Rym: Meatloaf Concerts.

74
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,350
Rym: Autobiography tour.

75
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:03,662
Rym: Oh, that's Todd.

76
00:03:03,723 --> 00:03:03,969
Rym: Okay.

77
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:05,647
Rym: Concerts.

78
00:03:06,092 --> 00:03:07,526
Rym: Won't sing on his new tour.

79
00:03:07,627 --> 00:03:07,930
Rym: Okay.

80
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,240
Rym: Okay, this is an article from July of this year.

81
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:14,670
Scott: That's recent enough.

82
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,124
Rym: Yup.

83
00:03:16,115 --> 00:03:16,708
Rym: Uh, let's see.

84
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:21,330
Rym: I think the tour he is doing or did recently, he is not singing.

85
00:03:21,692 --> 00:03:22,369
Scott: What's the point, then?

86
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:23,760
Rym: Uh, yeah.

87
00:03:23,882 --> 00:03:24,410
Rym: Why indeed?

88
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:25,670
Rym: I don't know.

89
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,230
Rym: I will follow up.

90
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,310
Rym: I will find out if it's still possible for me to see Meatloaf in concert one more time.

91
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,670
Scott: Are you going to see Meatloaf play the piano?

92
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:34,669
Rym: You see, he'll stand on stage.

93
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:37,567
Rym: He'll just rev a motorcycle the entire time.

94
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:44,850
Rym: But anyway, Hunter Mountain just built, like, a whole new side of the mountain.

95
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,750
Rym: Like, they cut a bunch of new trails.

96
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:47,630
Scott: They built a mountain.

97
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:53,809
Scott: The elemental stone has pulled new rocks out of the ground.

98
00:03:55,052 --> 00:03:58,450
Rym: So, they basically, they cut new trails into the side of the mountain that they weren't using.

99
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,642
Rym: And they made a whole bunch of, like, blue square trails, which in U.S.

100
00:04:02,662 --> 00:04:05,130
Rym: ski culture means intermediate trails.

101
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,408
Rym: Meaning, the trails that normal people ski on.

102
00:04:08,091 --> 00:04:18,869
Rym: Which means, if I go to Hunter Mountain now, all the people who are only okay at skiing are going to be using this whole other side of the mountain with its own lift and they're going to be out of the bottom of the mountain I ski on.

103
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,150
Rym: Meaning, I can ski a lot more because there's going to be way less lines to get to the hard part of the mountain.

104
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,830
Rym: Meaning, it's going to be a real good time to ski there and I'm probably going to go there this weekend.

105
00:04:28,693 --> 00:04:30,210
Rym: And it's ski season and I'm really excited.

106
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,670
Rym: So, if any of you want to ski with me at some point, I'll tweet when I'm going.

107
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:35,652
Scott: Do not do this.

108
00:04:35,732 --> 00:04:41,850
Scott: Everyone who participates in any sporting event or activity with Rym always gets injured every time.

109
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,090
Rym: The rule is very specific.

110
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:49,810
Rym: Anyone who ever rides a bike with me in Australia is definitely going to the hospital.

111
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,170
Scott: I would not ski with Rym either.

112
00:04:51,972 --> 00:04:54,427
Scott: You should not ski period, but definitely don't ski with Rym.

113
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:54,970
Scott: That's even worse.

114
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,310
Rym: So, no one who has been skiing with me has ever had to go to the hospital.

115
00:05:00,871 --> 00:05:13,069
Rym: One person who was skiing with me busted their thumb up pretty bad once, but required aspirin and, like, a half hour to chill out and then was able to ski the rest of that day and the rest of the trip.

116
00:05:13,432 --> 00:05:14,710
Scott: No one who has ever stayed at home.

117
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,770
Rym: That was our friend, Chris Reimer.

118
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:23,530
Scott: No one who has ever stayed at home and played Smash Brothers this weekend has ever been out in the cold and the wet snow.

119
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:32,350
Rym: I'll bet more people have died in the course of playing Smash Brothers than have hurt themselves doing a sports activity with me.

120
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,590
Scott: That's because they were playing with someone with anger issues who punched them out after they cut their ass.

121
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,070
Rym: Or they're just really bad at Smash Brothers.

122
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:42,289
Scott: You know what to do this weekend, people.

123
00:05:42,571 --> 00:05:42,700
Rym: Yeah.

124
00:05:43,673 --> 00:05:45,030
Scott: It's warm and toasty by the fire.

125
00:05:45,630 --> 00:06:02,330
Rym: So anyway, the biggest news, of course, is that Tumblr has banned pornography and has implemented an algorithm to identify this pornography, and the algorithm has basically identified literally fucking everything on Tumblr except Nazis and white supremacists.

126
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:10,088
Scott: I've also heard that people are just going around and reporting everything, even things that aren't reporting literally every Tumblr post to sort of mess with the...

127
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:15,930
Rym: Yes, which is brilliant and wonderful because the system they put in place to flag posts is terrible.

128
00:06:17,353 --> 00:06:19,249
Rym: This is actually pretty big news.

129
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,909
Rym: Like, this is a big deal.

130
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:26,670
Rym: Tumblr just basically destroyed itself because it's not, like, there's a lot of weird angles.

131
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,030
Rym: One angle is, the main reason they're doing this is they got delisted from what, like, the Apple Store?

132
00:06:31,594 --> 00:06:33,288
Rym: They were in trouble because...

133
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:47,090
Scott: No, the main reason they did it is... The deal is even the Apple Store ties into it, but the main reason they're doing this is because they want advertising money and advertisers will... The big advertisers will not buy ads on a site with porn where their ad could be next to porn.

134
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:47,610
Rym: Yep.

135
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,410
Rym: And secondary to that, there is a lot of child porn on Tumblr.

136
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,510
Scott: There is a lot of stuff on porn that is not good.

137
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:56,189
Rym: Yep.

138
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:03,810
Rym: But the problem is, Tumblr never really put in any sort of system to in any way control the content on their platform.

139
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:04,346
Scott: Nope.

140
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:18,910
Rym: So, now they're in a weird situation where they want this sweet, sweet advertiser money, and the only way to do that is to basically remove porn from their system, but this is extra complicated by the fact that it's not just porn.

141
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:34,310
Rym: It's basically the things that, like, bullshit basic advertisers would consider to be harmful to their own brands, which tends to include things like non-pornographic LGBT content, or basically anything interesting.

142
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:35,845
Rym: Like, what is their rule?

143
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,690
Scott: Anything sex-related in any way.

144
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:42,730
Rym: Yes, but also things that are not in any way sex-related, like... What do they say specifically?

145
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:44,830
Rym: Female-appearing nipples.

146
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,690
Scott: No, female-presenting nipples.

147
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,170
Scott: Yes, female-presenting nipples.

148
00:07:48,631 --> 00:07:57,649
Scott: If the person who the nipples belong to is a female-presenting person, regardless of their actual sex or gender or whatever, then those nipples are not okay.

149
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,690
Rym: Yes, even if those nipples are not presented in a sexual context.

150
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:12,790
Scott: So even if there was a trans man who was presenting as male, their nipples, which are genetically female nipples originally, right, those are okay?

151
00:08:13,532 --> 00:08:14,889
Scott: Because they're male-presenting nipples?

152
00:08:15,272 --> 00:08:16,609
Rym: As long as they're male-presenting.

153
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:21,570
Rym: But here's the thing, the Tumblr should not be weighing in on that kind of thing, and also...

154
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:32,250
Scott: I think I've talked about it in the show before, there's a great Instagram account that's literally just photos of individual nipples, and you have no idea the sex, gender, or anything of the person the nipple belongs to.

155
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:33,249
Rym: That's good stuff, that account.

156
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:33,969
Scott: It's very good.

157
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,890
Scott: That nipple could belong to anybody.

158
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:55,910
Rym: But the fact that, in particular, American society and the kinds of people that these basic advertisers want to target consider a female-appearing nipple to be sexually offensive, irrespective of whether or not it's presented in a sexual context, because they just assume that female nipples are sexual in all contexts.

159
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:03,370
Rym: And also, they flagged and have a history of flagging just anything that's LGBT-related as being sexual.

160
00:09:03,892 --> 00:09:05,309
Rym: Which is clearly not true.

161
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:09,530
Rym: So Tumblr is going to disappear as a platform.

162
00:09:10,032 --> 00:09:31,650
Scott: The main problem is simply the same thing that upsets me always, is that there is a wealth of important historical content and information that will be destroyed, presumably, and we cannot save all of it for... It's like a Library of Alexandria situation, just like when GeoCities went down.

163
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:36,287
Rym: I saw the beacon go up, and Twitter was like, "What will happen to all these hilarious hentai

164
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:36,649
Rym: gifs?".

165
00:09:37,196 --> 00:09:37,609
Scott: Exactly.

166
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,155
Scott: There should actually be some sort of records preservation law.

167
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:51,406
Scott: that's like, "Hey, if you start some service and collect a fuck-ton of important works, you are not allowed to do this.

168
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:52,348
Scott: You must preserve

169
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:52,549
Scott: them.".

170
00:09:55,412 --> 00:10:02,990
Scott: That might disincentivize people from creating things like Tumblr, because they will then be required to preserve those things for all time.

171
00:10:03,975 --> 00:10:05,329
Rym: Meanwhile, the GeekNights forum...

172
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,349
Scott: It will trap everyone who has already created a thing.

173
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,750
Rym: Remember, the GeekNights forum, the original one, is still on the internet.

174
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,989
Rym: We are paying money to keep it up as long as we can.

175
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:18,390
Scott: All of GeekNights and all our forum and everything have been preserved.

176
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:30,870
Scott: Even the IRC channel, which I don't think anyone uses, I had an automatic logging thing saving all the logs from it somewhere, which is why I'm sort of anti-Discord and whatnot, because I can't do that on Discord.

177
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:32,840
Scott: I talked to Discord developers at PAX.

178
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:34,428
Scott: They said, "No, you can't do

179
00:10:34,488 --> 00:10:34,669
Scott: that.".

180
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,629
Rym: Yep, we actually talked to them at length about Discord.

181
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:44,649
Scott: If they at that time, when I talked to them two or three years ago at PAX West, had said, "Yes, here is how to do that," we would be so Discord right now?

182
00:10:46,011 --> 00:11:00,870
Rym: So, the other issue that this brings up, because we can't cover this topic, this would be a whole show if we went deep into these problems with Tumblr, but one thing it brings up is the fundamental problem of the modern internet in that nobody has a monetization model that works.

183
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:01,954
Scott: I do.

184
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:03,150
Scott: You pay me fucking money.

185
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,034
Rym: Yes, pay for a site.

186
00:11:04,477 --> 00:11:08,969
Rym: If Tumblr costs like a dollar a month, all these problems would have been solved.

187
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:10,908
Rym: I would probably pay the dollar.

188
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,509
Scott: That's not enough money for them, though.

189
00:11:13,251 --> 00:11:14,510
Scott: They're so greedy, they want more.

190
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,621
Rym: So, here's the problem number two.

191
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:26,110
Rym: A lot of services, in particular things like Twitter, could eminently run at a modest profit indefinitely with very small subscription fees.

192
00:11:26,472 --> 00:11:33,950
Rym: The problem is, those platforms exist originally, because people invested money in these platforms, and they expect massive returns.

193
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:43,509
Rym: And the money that these platforms could make in a traditional, sustainable business model could never satisfy the terrifying greed of the people who invested in the first place.

194
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:49,829
Rym: The other indictment that I have about this is that at no-- Who owns Tumblr now, Verizon?

195
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:50,989
Rym: Yeah, it's like Verizon.

196
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,720
Scott: Didn't Verizon buy Yahoo or something?

197
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:53,847
Scott: Right?

198
00:11:53,968 --> 00:11:54,270
Scott: I forget.

199
00:11:54,631 --> 00:12:00,210
Rym: So, white supremacist bullshit and Nazi stuff is not banned by this new policy.

200
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:00,766
Scott: Nope.

201
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,950
Rym: Because advertisers don't care that much about that.

202
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:09,030
Rym: In fact, they probably would like their ads to be alongside that content, because that's the zeitgeist of America.

203
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:24,109
Rym: So, the only benefit of this entire situation is that I think with the death of Tumblr, so too dies that particular Tumblr call-out culture, because those people will have nowhere else to go.

204
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:33,709
Rym: There's no other platform that will let them have their fights about how the headcanon they made up for some particular Steven Universe character-- They could do it on Twitter.

205
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,130
Rym: But those people don't tend to, and people ignore them on Twitter.

206
00:12:37,412 --> 00:12:38,890
Rym: Tumblr people will engage with them.

207
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,130
Rym: I feel like that whole culture is going to disappear overnight, and nothing will be lost.

208
00:12:44,211 --> 00:12:46,900
Scott: There are some new sites, isn't there?

209
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,010
Scott: Like a pillow something or something?

210
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:54,026
Rym: Even Pornhub was like, "Yo, come to our platform.

211
00:12:54,086 --> 00:12:54,709
Rym: We will help you

212
00:12:54,729 --> 00:12:54,870
Rym: out.".

213
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:55,895
Scott: Oh yeah, people don't know this.

214
00:12:55,956 --> 00:12:58,590
Scott: I knew this for a long time, and people were surprised by it.

215
00:12:58,831 --> 00:13:06,181
Scott: But the way Pornhub works is that you go there, you make an account, and you upload images, text, videos.

216
00:13:06,222 --> 00:13:08,469
Scott: You just upload porn of whatever medium it is.

217
00:13:09,391 --> 00:13:13,870
Scott: It might just be pictures of telephones, because that's your-- And then people find your porn and watch it.

218
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,770
Scott: And you're supposed to have legal porn that you upload.

219
00:13:18,092 --> 00:13:32,910
Scott: You're either a porn company that has free samples of your legal porn with links to your actual pay site, or you're a person who makes porn at home, and you've got the right paperwork so that you don't get in trouble because you proved that it's not child porn, that sort of thing.

220
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,430
Scott: You do some live streams of yourself, or your friends, or who knows.

221
00:13:38,131 --> 00:13:39,137
Scott: That's what it's supposed to be.

222
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,130
Scott: But you can just make a Pornhub account.

223
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:47,230
Scott: Even though your URL will be Pornhub, and the site will probably have porn ads on the side of it, you can just upload whatever the fuck you want.

224
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,598
Scott: You can upload your webcomic on Pornhub.

225
00:13:48,618 --> 00:13:50,390
Scott: You can upload GeekNights on Pornhub.

226
00:13:51,857 --> 00:13:54,190
Scott: You can livestream your video games on Pornhub.

227
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:58,983
Rym: And more importantly, their business model is around sharing that revenue with the creators of that porn.

228
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,550
Scott: Right, because they make a lot of money on Pornhub.

229
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,650
Scott: They've got people signing up to pay for accounts, and they also have a lot of ads for the people who don't have accounts.

230
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,664
Scott: You know, ads for porn, but there's still ads that pay money.

231
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,690
Scott: They're not ads for Coca-Cola.

232
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:20,250
Scott: And then they share that money with the people who make the content, just like YouTube does.

233
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,869
Rym: The first basic company like Coca-Cola, who's like, "You know what?

234
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,757
Rym: Just put my ads next to the porn.

235
00:14:24,777 --> 00:14:27,529
Rym: It's probably going to do really well in the long

236
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:27,729
Rym: run.".

237
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:28,733
Scott: I don't know why.

238
00:14:29,095 --> 00:14:33,210
Scott: They're so worried about doing this because of a very, very small, loud number of people.

239
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,250
Scott: But it's like, okay, what's the family, whatever group?

240
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:39,109
Rym: The Parents Television Council.

241
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:47,970
Scott: So they find out that Coca-Cola is buying ads on porn on the internet, and they have a letter-writing campaign.

242
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,186
Scott: It's like, "They're not going to stop drinking fucking

243
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:50,429
Scott: Coca-Cola.".

244
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,052
Rym: No, they're not.

245
00:14:51,654 --> 00:14:55,750
Rym: They're going to go to Pepsi because Pepsi's the brand that's anti-porn and pro-white supremacy.

246
00:14:56,755 --> 00:14:57,589
Scott: That's not how it works.

247
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,590
Scott: They're still going to be drinking it, right?

248
00:15:00,153 --> 00:15:01,870
Scott: You're so worried about these letter-writing campaigns.

249
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,208
Scott: Companies don't have the balls to just fucking ignore it when you know how many people it is.

250
00:15:06,014 --> 00:15:07,730
Scott: You know that it's just a manufactured thing.

251
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:12,730
Scott: Why do they keep listening and obeying when a small number of people manage to organize?

252
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:17,150
Scott: It's like you should understand the will of the quiet masses.

253
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,308
Scott: Those are your market researches.

254
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:23,224
Scott: You're paying all this money for market research, and you listen to a bunch of old ladies writing letters.

255
00:15:23,728 --> 00:15:23,950
Scott: Come on.

256
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:32,309
Rym: But just this fundamental problem is that all these internet services rely on revenue streams that literally cannot work in the real world.

257
00:15:34,871 --> 00:15:35,897
Rym: We've solved this problem.

258
00:15:35,937 --> 00:15:40,289
Rym: We have not implemented any solutions to this problem, and it's only going to get worse.

259
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:53,530
Rym: In some other news, I don't know how many of you are paying attention to what happened in France, but the barricades went up, and there were giant riots and fires and pitched battles and bullshit.

260
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,530
Scott: Are you sure you're not reading a 200-year-old news article?

261
00:15:58,511 --> 00:16:11,529
Rym: I've been to Paris a couple of times, and all I want to say is that we don't think a lot about how Parisians interact with their government, but the barricades come up more often than you realize.

262
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:20,330
Rym: Let's go read about the history of Paris, and you have this vision of Jean Valjean and all this nonsense.

263
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,637
Scott: No, that's their go-to move.

264
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:23,410
Scott: It's not a dramatization.

265
00:16:23,712 --> 00:16:26,650
Rym: Yeah, that still happens today, and this was another one of those.

266
00:16:28,132 --> 00:16:30,746
Rym: You can read these articles because, gig nights, we were not news.

267
00:16:30,766 --> 00:16:31,510
Rym: We were commentary.

268
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:53,547
Rym: I hope you already know this was happening, and I'm not going to explain the details of who the yellow vests are, but the reason this news is interesting is that the way right-wing media is trying to spin this is that the common people of Paris rose up against this ridiculous environmental legislation because they have practical ideas about the economy.

269
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:54,030
Rym: No.

270
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,053
Rym: But that's not what happened.

271
00:16:55,354 --> 00:17:12,810
Rym: The problem is, these kinds of laws, like these fuel taxes, or like in New York City, like right now, once again, we can't afford to pay for our subway because of conservatives upstate, so we're forced to once again raise prices on MetroCards to pay for the subway.

272
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:22,910
Rym: The problem is, if you tax the users of systems like the normal people, those people are the ones least equipped to pay, and you don't actually solve the problem.

273
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:27,069
Rym: You're putting the cost of solving a global problem on your poorest citizens.

274
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:34,749
Scott: You should tax the car people to pay for the train to disincentivize people from driving a car, and make them want to take a free train.

275
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:41,670
Rym: You should tax the rich people to subsidize the train so the poor people who have cars will naturally migrate to the mass transit.

276
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:47,450
Rym: You tax the people who are causing the problem, and the people who are causing the problem are always the companies and the rich people.

277
00:17:47,811 --> 00:17:49,237
Rym: Not even the people driving the cars.

278
00:17:49,478 --> 00:17:57,570
Rym: The people driving the cars are doing so because they are incentivized to do so by a massive system of subsidies paid for by the rich people who have a vested interest in keeping this going.

279
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:03,530
Rym: Anyway, read this news article and internalize it, and if anyone tries to tell you that, well, two things.

280
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:11,870
Rym: One, if anyone tries to tell you that these people were fighting against environmental regulation, they are lying to you and they probably read bad sites.

281
00:18:12,231 --> 00:18:22,129
Rym: And two, I feel like the US could learn from this, and I feel like if the left in the US would throw up the barricades a little more often, we might make some more progress in our government.

282
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:30,430
Scott: The problem is that historically speaking, there are some countries, like France or South Korea, where protest has been effective.

283
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:36,790
Scott: South Koreans, in the late 80s, they were still a military dictatorship and then they fixed it.

284
00:18:37,498 --> 00:18:37,790
Rym: Mostly.

285
00:18:38,971 --> 00:18:40,835
Scott: They vote now, right?

286
00:18:41,115 --> 00:18:48,250
Scott: But it's like they've been voting less long than I've been alive, but they got their vote by protesting.

287
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:52,290
Scott: They had student protests and they actually were able to change their government with student protests.

288
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:58,430
Scott: In France, they also have been able to change their government with more violent protests and revolutions.

289
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:07,970
Scott: In the United States, protest, while it has been totally cool and happened many times, it has not been nearly as effective.

290
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:08,752
Rym: Here's an example.

291
00:19:08,893 --> 00:19:17,510
Rym: Occupy Wall Street didn't have an endgame that was achievable and specific, nor did it actually cause enough problems for people to be forced to deal with it.

292
00:19:19,051 --> 00:19:24,170
Rym: The yellow vest thing got to fucking shut down Paris, so the government had to do something.

293
00:19:24,811 --> 00:19:27,290
Rym: Occupy Wall Street should have shut down Wall Street.

294
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:35,010
Scott: There have rarely, very rarely, has the US government or even more local governments responded directly to protests.

295
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:40,510
Scott: Usually, they quell the protests and then they continue with business as usual after things quiet down.

296
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,123
Rym: So all I'm saying is, if you didn't really...

297
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:48,370
Scott: That is why we don't have a culture of protesting more, because when it works, then people keep doing it.

298
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:53,590
Scott: In places around the world where it works, people do it and it keeps working and they have a culture of doing it.

299
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:58,630
Scott: In the United States, we keep trying it and it's not as effective, therefore we don't do it more.

300
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:02,968
Rym: So all I'm saying is, don't just remember, "Oh yeah, something happened in

301
00:20:02,988 --> 00:20:03,249
Rym: Paris.".

302
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:10,670
Rym: Actually read a news article about this and think about what is different in that situation from what's going on here, and make decisions accordingly.

303
00:20:12,131 --> 00:20:17,230
Rym: These protests are a big deal and a lot of people are trying to spin them in ways that are not accurate to the real situation.

304
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:25,450
Rym: Last and not least, my favorite people, the Satanic Church, are with the Satanic Temple.

305
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,730
Rym: There's a bunch of different Satanists.

306
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:27,749
Scott: The best of all temples.

307
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,782
Rym: The Satanic Temple is a pretty cool organization.

308
00:20:29,803 --> 00:20:30,669
Rym: Seriously.

309
00:20:31,753 --> 00:20:34,069
Scott: There's a lot of different kinds of Satanists, but these are the good ones.

310
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:42,290
Rym: Yes, but they've been winning a lot of fights lately around putting up their satanic... Basically, satanic nativity scenes.

311
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:50,610
Scott: Listen, if you're going to invest in that badass fucking statue of Baphomet or whatever, you better get some fucking use out of it and they sure as hell are, or you're not just going to keep that shit in a garage somewhere.

312
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,441
Scott: You've got to let the world see it.

313
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,470
Scott: Let us behold its glory.

314
00:20:55,691 --> 00:21:04,648
Rym: The Satanic Temple is an example of very effective forms of protest because they're actually... It's working, because here's what they do.

315
00:21:06,351 --> 00:21:10,410
Rym: Someone puts up a Christian religious thing somewhere in a public space.

316
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,865
Scott: Like usually a manger.

317
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,670
Rym: Yeah, like a manger in a town square.

318
00:21:13,711 --> 00:21:14,348
Rym: Or the baby Jesus.

319
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,626
Rym: No, I'm an atheist, but that's fine.

320
00:21:16,707 --> 00:21:17,150
Rym: I don't care.

321
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:26,569
Rym: I'm happy that people can express their religion in a public space, but any religion has to be able to do that, but in most places, only Christians end up doing it.

322
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:31,086
Rym: So the Satanic Temple will show up and say, "We want to put Satan there next to the baby

323
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:31,449
Rym: Jesus.".

324
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:31,883
Scott: That's right.

325
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,788
Scott: "I want to put my menorah next to the baby

326
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:34,970
Scott: Jesus.".

327
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:39,550
Rym: It's very difficult for them to lose any lawsuit around this because of the First Amendment.

328
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:45,270
Rym: So as a result, the places that only have Christian stuff have basically two options.

329
00:21:45,691 --> 00:21:52,030
Rym: They either have to let the Satanists put up their thing, or they have to let nobody put up anything religious.

330
00:21:52,252 --> 00:21:53,990
Scott: Those are the only two legal options.

331
00:21:54,270 --> 00:22:00,229
Scott: This is like, you know, unless you get some crazy Christian judge somewhere, but then you just appeal to the next judge.

332
00:22:01,171 --> 00:22:05,150
Rym: Even a ruined Supreme Court has a hard time shutting this down.

333
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,167
Scott: They're like, "No, the Supreme Court won't even hear that

334
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:07,389
Scott: case.".

335
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:16,222
Scott: They'll be like, "Yeah, unless for some reason there's a crazy judge in the second-to-last appellate court or whatever that messed it up and was a crazy

336
00:22:16,242 --> 00:22:16,586
Scott: Christian.".

337
00:22:17,071 --> 00:22:27,890
Rym: So basically, either all the religion in public spaces gets removed, or religious freedom actually happens, and any religion gets to show up.

338
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,798
Rym: Those are both wins.

339
00:22:29,243 --> 00:22:29,930
Scott: Either one works.

340
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,510
Scott: Yeah, either no more mangers.

341
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,988
Scott: Sorry, you Christian people who are so mad about it, but you're all mad now.

342
00:22:35,371 --> 00:22:36,170
Scott: You can have your manger.

343
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,549
Scott: We can laugh at you being mad.

344
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:42,430
Scott: Or we get to put our badass Satan right there in the town square.

345
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:54,970
Rym: So to tie this into the previous news, activism, where either outcome in court gets the actual goal to move forward, is the best kind of activism.

346
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,370
Rym: The Satanic Temple isn't just funny and clever.

347
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:01,090
Rym: It is very effective in the area in which it is working.

348
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:06,330
Scott: What I'm saying is that in the United States, going in the street and yelling has not been as effective as it has been in other places.

349
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:10,590
Rym: Yeah, but meanwhile, putting up statues of Baphomet has been pretty effective in the narrow realm.

350
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,370
Scott: Are there any other countries where people put up statues of Baphomet?

351
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:16,630
Scott: No, because we're the only one with freedom of speech in our Constitution.

352
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:17,845
Rym: Yeah, we're also the only one...

353
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,569
Scott: Not the absolute only one, but we're the only people who have it.

354
00:23:20,589 --> 00:23:20,649
Scott: so...

355
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:35,299
Rym: Well, also we have a particular issue with Christian hegemony and there's a whole other thing that we don't have time to talk about because it's time for... Things of the Day!

356
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:41,820
Rym: So you know when you see a picture of an old-timey boxer, they're always holding their hands up in this ridiculous position.

357
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:44,479
Scott: Yeah, one fist forward with the other one behind it.

358
00:23:45,021 --> 00:23:46,837
Rym: Yep, and their fists are up and they're like, "Fists of

359
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:47,100
Rym: cuffs!"

360
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,948
Rym: and "They've got a handlebar

361
00:23:47,988 --> 00:23:48,452
Rym: mustache!"

362
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:49,199
Rym: and that kind of thing.

363
00:23:49,821 --> 00:23:52,164
Rym: So here's a ten minute long video... Too long.

364
00:23:52,286 --> 00:23:53,499
Scott: Just explain it to me in two sentences.

365
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:57,540
Rym: It's actually complicated enough that it warrants a ten minute video.

366
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,400
Rym: It is way more complicated than I thought as to why they did it that way.

367
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,059
Scott: I'll make a saved you a click for it.

368
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:16,519
Rym: So the best way I can describe it is that this was the fighting stance during that era of boxing, but the reason that was effective is that Nobody wore gloves.

369
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:25,599
Rym: So while you could technically punch someone as hard as you could in the face, you would probably break your hand permanently in the course of doing so.

370
00:24:26,461 --> 00:24:31,360
Rym: So as a result, boxers wouldn't do it because they would win the fight and lose the career.

371
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,167
Rym: Like, they'd be over.

372
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,439
Rym: They'd ruin their hand.

373
00:24:33,961 --> 00:24:38,300
Rym: So if they hit someone in the head, they couldn't hit them as hard as they could punch.

374
00:24:38,941 --> 00:24:40,800
Rym: So head hits weren't actually that effective.

375
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,800
Scott: You could punch them straight in the front of the face.

376
00:24:43,145 --> 00:24:44,139
Rym: Even then, that's tough.

377
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:50,160
Rym: Two, the style of fighting back then also allowed grappling.

378
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:58,138
Rym: So if you just tucked in like this, the other guy could get way closer to you than you were comfortable with and potentially grab you.

379
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:04,620
Rym: So you had to have the one hand out to keep them at bay with little jabs and protect yourself and counter punch, and the one hand back.

380
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:11,959
Rym: So if they come in and you get in the right situation, you can do a full punch to the gut and that other hand otherwise is protecting the gut.

381
00:25:12,684 --> 00:25:15,640
Rym: But there's actually more to this story than just that.

382
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,840
Rym: This video is worth watching.

383
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,339
Rym: So anyway, now if you watch the video, you will know why boxers stand like this.

384
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,700
Rym: And also, I just really like the aesthetic of people standing like this.

385
00:25:25,821 --> 00:25:26,520
Rym: I think it's hilarious.

386
00:25:27,581 --> 00:25:28,139
Rym: So what do you got?

387
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,680
Scott: So here's some people, and in their bathroom, they've got a rat in the bathroom.

388
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,299
Scott: And they want to get the rat out of the house.

389
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,440
Rym: But they don't want to kill the rat.

390
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:45,900
Scott: It seems like they don't want to use any of the methods I'm already aware of, not even the humane ones, such as the trap or the bowl full of oil or any of these other things.

391
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,706
Rym: They don't want to hurt the rat.

392
00:25:46,727 --> 00:25:48,340
Rym: They just want the rat to be out of their apartment.

393
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,359
Scott: They came up with a new way to get rid of the rat.

394
00:25:50,680 --> 00:26:00,580
Scott: And what's most interesting about this video is not only is it a great video of how they get the rat out of the bathroom and out of the house, it was posted in Sports Reddit appropriately.

395
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:07,900
Scott: Don't worry, the rat is not harmed other than being thrown out of his nice bathroom home and onto the outside.

396
00:26:08,141 --> 00:26:12,200
Rym: Yep, he bounces down the stairs a little bit, but he's clearly fine and just angry at the bottom.

397
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:14,980
Scott: The rat, I mean, if you're just a little rat, you're fine going down the stairs.

398
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,260
Scott: You're not a Scot falling down the stairs.

399
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,380
Rym: Yeah, if a river or a Scot fell down those stairs, we would be dead.

400
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,120
Scott: Yeah, a rat can go down those stairs no problem.

401
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:22,817
Rym: The rat's just like, "Son of a

402
00:26:22,837 --> 00:26:22,940
Rym: bitch.".

403
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,214
Scott: He's just like, "Ah, I want to go back to the bathroom.

404
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,118
Scott: I was happy in

405
00:26:27,138 --> 00:26:27,259
Scott: there.".

406
00:26:28,446 --> 00:26:30,860
Rym: This is a gift that is, in effect, a team sport.

407
00:26:31,204 --> 00:26:31,292
Rym: Yeah.

408
00:26:32,481 --> 00:26:41,160
Rym: In the Metamoment, the Keaton House Book Club book, which we've been busy but will read soon, is 2001 A Space Odyssey, following out from Emily Wilson's translation of A Hameric Odyssey.

409
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:47,359
Rym: Otherwise, we were just at the Penny Arcade Expo, PAX Unplugged.

410
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,000
Scott: The unplugged version where it was no video games allowed.

411
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,240
Rym: Where we did not one.

412
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,037
Scott: Except for the illicit board games on SNES in the classic cardboard room.

413
00:26:56,218 --> 00:26:56,680
Scott: Don't tell anyone.

414
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,995
Rym: I saw people playing there, like all PAX.

415
00:26:59,015 --> 00:26:59,699
Rym: That looked real fun.

416
00:27:00,181 --> 00:27:00,726
Scott: Why not?

417
00:27:00,867 --> 00:27:02,520
Scott: We played Wheel of Fortune and Family Feud a lot.

418
00:27:02,661 --> 00:27:04,920
Rym: I feel like we should stream some Family Feud maybe over the holidays.

419
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,334
Scott: Let's do it.

420
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,555
Rym: I'll set that up.

421
00:27:06,616 --> 00:27:06,820
Rym: Anyway.

422
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:08,619
Scott: Are you working between Christmas and New Year's?

423
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,041
Rym: Yes.

424
00:27:09,805 --> 00:27:12,178
Rym: I've earned all my fucking vacation days.

425
00:27:12,258 --> 00:27:12,580
Scott: I have nothing.

426
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:18,100
Scott: I have had two jobs in a row where everyone gets off between Christmas and New Year, and Rym has had zero jobs.

427
00:27:18,561 --> 00:27:22,234
Rym: Dude, when they announced that Wednesday was going to be a holiday because of George H.W.

428
00:27:22,254 --> 00:27:30,053
Rym: Bush's death and funeral and everything, I got an email within an hour that basically said, "Yeah, wall markets are closed.

429
00:27:30,454 --> 00:27:31,136
Rym: We are not.

430
00:27:31,356 --> 00:27:32,559
Rym: Everyone still has to come to

431
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:32,780
Rym: work.".

432
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,318
Rym: That's right.

433
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,697
Rym: So I had to go to work.

434
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,039
Scott: What if you're a trader, though?

435
00:27:37,802 --> 00:27:39,300
Rym: That's a different company, technically.

436
00:27:39,542 --> 00:27:40,300
Scott: I know, but I'm saying.

437
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,280
Rym: I ain't a trader.

438
00:27:41,824 --> 00:27:42,520
Scott: There's nothing to do.

439
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,800
Rym: You might be trading all the other markets that aren't in the US.

440
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,660
Scott: Yeah, but even when the market's closed, on Labor Day, people don't go to work.

441
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,465
Rym: Some people do.

442
00:27:52,091 --> 00:27:52,837
Rym: International trader.

443
00:27:52,918 --> 00:27:53,140
Rym: Anyway.

444
00:27:55,183 --> 00:28:04,636
Rym: So we did three hours of panels at this PAX, and one of them is already on the internet because PAX was kind enough to put that panel in the biggest panel room.

445
00:28:05,057 --> 00:28:05,840
Rym: that was live streamed.

446
00:28:05,861 --> 00:28:06,559
Scott: That was not main events.

447
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:06,960
Rym: Yep.

448
00:28:07,322 --> 00:28:11,680
Rym: So we were live streamed on PAX2, and the VOD for that is on Twitch.

449
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,668
Scott: Twitch.tv/Pax2.

450
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:13,861
Rym: Yep.

451
00:28:14,262 --> 00:28:17,435
Rym: The VOD of that is just on the internet.

452
00:28:17,616 --> 00:28:18,520
Rym: You can just go watch it.

453
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,500
Scott: That's P-A-X, the number two, not P-A-X-T-W-O.

454
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,907
Rym: There is a link to it on our website.

455
00:28:24,268 --> 00:28:25,412
Rym: By the way, we have a website.

456
00:28:25,452 --> 00:28:33,416
Rym: You can go to it, and there's stuff there, including our awesome forum, which you should join, because the United's forum is notable in these trying times in that it is 100% Nazi free.

457
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,380
Rym: It is against our terms of service to be a Nazi dipshit in our forums.

458
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,086
Scott: And the way we do this is very simple.

459
00:28:41,226 --> 00:28:49,240
Scott: Because our forum is not enormous, with hundreds and hundreds of people applying, we manually approve or reject every single person who wants to make an account.

460
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,032
Rym: Meaning you have to type a sentence.

461
00:28:51,576 --> 00:28:52,020
Scott: Type text.

462
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,749
Scott: Which means if we ban someone, they cannot get back in.

463
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:57,820
Scott: So if there's a Nazi, we can just delete their post and kick them out at the end.

464
00:28:58,501 --> 00:29:02,538
Scott: And if there's a non-Nazi, well, you know, it's like, hey, you're in.

465
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:03,080
Scott: Good job.

466
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:03,922
Rym: Yeah.

467
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,148
Rym: It's a pretty good forum.

468
00:29:05,188 --> 00:29:05,751
Rym: You should join it.

469
00:29:05,852 --> 00:29:07,319
Rym: There's a lot of stuff going on in there.

470
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,616
Rym: So we will be at the next PAX after MAGFest, where we're doing a bunch of panels.

471
00:29:12,637 --> 00:29:13,580
Rym: Stay tuned for that announcement.

472
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,860
Scott: MAGFest is New Year's, and then there's a MAGFest, and then PAX South is what, two weeks after that?

473
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,900
Rym: Yeah, and then PAX East is right around the corner after that.

474
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,899
Scott: Let me check my calendar.

475
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,505
Rym: They're so close together.

476
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:28,460
Rym: I got a lot of panels to write in the next few weeks.

477
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,620
Rym: But at PAX South, we were doing at least one panel, and that panel is a brand new one, never before done anywhere.

478
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,388
Rym: Nostalgia versus game design.

479
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,255
Rym: I'm starting to write it.

480
00:29:39,295 --> 00:29:40,420
Rym: I'm feeling pretty good about it.

481
00:29:41,601 --> 00:29:42,563
Rym: This is going to be a fun panel.

482
00:29:42,603 --> 00:29:50,600
Rym: This is going to be a lot like the panels we ran around PAX West, PAX East, circa 2010, 2011.

483
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,130
Rym: It's like classic GeekNights style.

484
00:29:52,171 --> 00:29:53,339
Rym: I'm feeling this panel pretty big.

485
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:58,993
Rym: Beyond that, expect some live streams, expect some stuff going on.

486
00:29:59,394 --> 00:30:01,220
Rym: Stay tuned for on the GeekNights Patreon.

487
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:09,180
Rym: Me and Emily are going to be doing a parallel podcast where we're going to review and comment on every single Disney animated feature in chronological order.

488
00:30:09,864 --> 00:30:10,778
Rym: From beginning to now.

489
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,300
Scott: When's the last time you saw Snow White?

490
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:14,046
Rym: That's it.

491
00:30:14,067 --> 00:30:14,999
Rym: We're going to watch them all again.

492
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:28,838
Rym: What we're going to do is we're going to record us recalling what we remember about them, which some of these will be funny because I haven't seen them since my age was in the single digits, and then we're going to watch them.

493
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,070
Scott: Have you even seen all these?

494
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:30,980
Scott: Have you seen Sleeping Beauty?

495
00:30:31,224 --> 00:30:31,420
Rym: Yeah.

496
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:31,653
Scott: Ever?

497
00:30:31,881 --> 00:30:32,598
Rym: When I was a little kid.

498
00:30:34,983 --> 00:30:36,020
Scott: There's got to be some you haven't seen.

499
00:30:37,341 --> 00:30:38,650
Rym: Some recent ones, probably.

500
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,060
Rym: I never saw Pocahontas.

501
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:40,797
Scott: Me either.

502
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:41,980
Rym: Yeah, I just never saw it.

503
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:42,400
Rym: I don't need to.

504
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,179
Rym: I think I was in middle school when it came out.

505
00:30:44,341 --> 00:30:44,997
Scott: It's going to keep it that way.

506
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,379
Rym: I think it was in sixth grade, I want to say.

507
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:52,040
Rym: We've even played the music from it in the middle school band, but I had never seen it.

508
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:54,880
Rym: That was the first time I had to play a mellophone.

509
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:57,240
Rym: Also, fuck mellophones.

510
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,027
Rym: It's like a harder trumpet.

511
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:00,859
Rym: They're just not fun to play and they don't sound that good.

512
00:31:02,082 --> 00:31:02,725
Rym: So, yeah.

513
00:31:02,947 --> 00:31:05,260
Rym: Otherwise, food we hate.

514
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:13,900
Rym: I don't know why you guys love these food shows so much, but I was looking for a show to do tonight, and I haven't yet set up the call-in show, which we will be setting up.

515
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:15,815
Rym: We'll be doing those starting next year.

516
00:31:15,835 --> 00:31:16,280
Rym: Stay tuned.

517
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:30,019
Rym: But we do a lot of food shows, and there's a lot of food that I hate is a strong word, but there's food that we both will eat but do not like, and there is food that both of us will not eat.

518
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:31,866
Rym: So I'm curious.

519
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:33,620
Rym: What's the line, Scott?

520
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,656
Rym: What is the worst food bar?

521
00:31:36,281 --> 00:31:39,180
Rym: Now, again, we're not counting about starvation situation.

522
00:31:39,621 --> 00:31:44,279
Rym: Let's assume that we are not starving to death, that we have access to food.

523
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,760
Scott: It sounds like one of those scenarios from a Japanese adventure game.

524
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,763
Rym: There are nine doors.

525
00:31:50,425 --> 00:31:55,198
Rym: There are nine fast food restaurants, and you will die in 48 hours.

526
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,399
Scott: What puzzle do I have to solve to get the good food?

527
00:31:58,361 --> 00:32:00,499
Scott: Do I have to play the game twice to get the really good food?

528
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:02,819
Scott: Unlock the secret ending food?

529
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,620
Rym: You've got to eat the Arby's on a Tuesday, or it doesn't unlock the best ending.

530
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:16,760
Rym: So we're assuming that we are not starving to death, and that within 24 hours of whatever situation we're talking about, we can access better food.

531
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,185
Rym: So I'm curious, Scott.

532
00:32:18,245 --> 00:32:21,200
Rym: What is the worst food you would eat?

533
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,859
Scott: Lowest quality food?

534
00:32:22,981 --> 00:32:25,239
Rym: Yeah, lowest quality or worst type of food?

535
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,897
Scott: I mean, it just has to be...

536
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,199
Rym: Because they're two different things, I think.

537
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:33,000
Scott: I mean, I'm not starving, so it means I can go without food.

538
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,880
Rym: But it's either you eat this food for dinner, or your next meal is breakfast.

539
00:32:40,783 --> 00:32:42,000
Scott: So I'm still hungry.

540
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,780
Rym: You're hungry, but you're not dying.

541
00:32:44,201 --> 00:32:46,400
Rym: You've got to skip dinner or eat this food.

542
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,320
Rym: What is the worst kind of food you will eat, in terms of preference?

543
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:51,698
Rym: Like food you don't like.

544
00:32:52,441 --> 00:32:54,820
Scott: Something I don't want to eat, but I'll eat it anyway?

545
00:32:55,847 --> 00:32:56,694
Rym: You don't want to eat it.

546
00:32:56,734 --> 00:32:57,359
Rym: You don't like it.

547
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,000
Rym: You'll eat it anyway, rather than skip dinner.

548
00:33:01,102 --> 00:33:03,000
Rym: I think that's an interesting line to explore.

549
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,678
Scott: I guess I won't eat a McDonald's.

550
00:33:05,021 --> 00:33:07,279
Rym: I would skip dinner before I'd eat McDonald's.

551
00:33:08,482 --> 00:33:10,300
Rym: I'd definitely skip dinner before I'd eat Burger King.

552
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:11,600
Scott: I wouldn't eat a Burger King either.

553
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:12,400
Rym: I would never eat a Burger King.

554
00:33:12,541 --> 00:33:15,339
Scott: Well, I guess I might just eat a fry from McDonald's.

555
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:15,985
Rym: What do you eat?

556
00:33:16,006 --> 00:33:16,940
Rym: a fry from Burger King?

557
00:33:17,466 --> 00:33:17,899
Scott: It's a fry.

558
00:33:18,901 --> 00:33:21,080
Rym: Have you had a Burger King fry in your life?

559
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:24,140
Scott: I mean, it's a very small amount of potato and hot oil.

560
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:27,538
Scott: It's not really any different than getting a fry from any other, you know.

561
00:33:28,242 --> 00:33:30,400
Scott: Other places might have more potato or better oil.

562
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:35,280
Rym: So I would not eat a McDonald's dinner, like a burger, or anything they make.

563
00:33:35,443 --> 00:33:35,878
Scott: Absolutely not.

564
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:42,680
Rym: But I would eat a McDonald's breakfast, or even a McDonald's hash brown, in that situation, rather than skip dinner.

565
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,460
Rym: But I would not eat a McDonald's hamburger under any circumstances.

566
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,019
Scott: McDonald's has an apple you can get.

567
00:33:48,502 --> 00:33:49,960
Rym: So an apple, you'd eat an apple instead of dinner?

568
00:33:50,847 --> 00:33:51,259
Rym: Yeah, it's an apple.

569
00:33:51,561 --> 00:33:52,160
Rym: I think that's fine.

570
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:52,938
Scott: I would not eat an apple.

571
00:33:53,261 --> 00:33:53,971
Rym: So what's the bottom?

572
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,720
Rym: Because an apple's not that bad.

573
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,319
Rym: You like apples.

574
00:33:56,542 --> 00:33:57,119
Scott: I do like apples.

575
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,160
Rym: What's the worst food you would eat instead of skipping dinner?

576
00:34:01,185 --> 00:34:01,820
Rym: What's the bottom?

577
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,420
Scott: I won't eat a can of tuna fish.

578
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:03,800
Scott: That's gross.

579
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,326
Rym: Oh, no.

580
00:34:04,611 --> 00:34:05,018
Rym: No, no, no.

581
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,500
Rym: Of course, you saw that millennials are killing canned tuna.

582
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,440
Rym: No one will eat that bland, garbage canned tuna.

583
00:34:09,702 --> 00:34:10,257
Scott: It smells awful.

584
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:10,824
Rym: Yeah.

585
00:34:11,112 --> 00:34:11,420
Rym: It's funny.

586
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,117
Rym: The article was literally like, "Millennials won't eat tuna

587
00:34:14,158 --> 00:34:14,480
Rym: anymore.".

588
00:34:14,781 --> 00:34:21,398
Rym: But then the details were, "Millennials want to buy actual tuna and shred it themselves, fresh, rather than buy garbage canned

589
00:34:21,438 --> 00:34:21,560
Rym: tuna.".

590
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,440
Scott: Yeah, well, it's too much money and it's not good for fishes.

591
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,580
Rym: Yup, it's also not good.

592
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,799
Scott: I guess I would eat some fish that wasn't too fishy.

593
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:32,478
Rym: So what's too fishy?

594
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,060
Rym: What's your line?

595
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:34,279
Scott: Well, because you get fish.

596
00:34:35,181 --> 00:34:36,540
Scott: You buy fish sticks, right?

597
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:37,500
Scott: Fish sticks are too fishy.

598
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,239
Scott: You buy it from the grocery store, like frozen fish sticks.

599
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,148
Rym: I would eat frozen fish sticks.

600
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,260
Scott: They smell way fishy and gross.

601
00:34:43,761 --> 00:34:45,040
Rym: See, I like fishy fish.

602
00:34:45,301 --> 00:34:46,139
Scott: I don't like fishy fish.

603
00:34:46,321 --> 00:34:48,380
Rym: I like a really fishy fish.

604
00:34:48,502 --> 00:34:49,199
Scott: No, no, no.

605
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,400
Scott: If it's too ocean-y, you know, it's like that doesn't taste good.

606
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:52,900
Rym: I like that kind.

607
00:34:53,322 --> 00:34:54,899
Rym: I'll just eat anchovies straight up.

608
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,120
Scott: I mean, I like anchovy, but those aren't too fishy.

609
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,500
Scott: They're salty and it's a different flavor than anchovy.

610
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,279
Rym: They're pretty fishy, too.

611
00:35:03,943 --> 00:35:05,500
Rym: You usually don't eat a lot of anchovy.

612
00:35:06,201 --> 00:35:11,280
Scott: There's this smell you get when you go to a low-quality seafood restaurant.

613
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,880
Rym: Oh, but I love that fishy fish.

614
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,020
Scott: You buy a crappy piece of fish that is low-quality or frozen.

615
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,000
Scott: It's just like plain, boring, white fish of some kind.

616
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,034
Scott: It smells way fishy, like it's got ocean all over it.

617
00:35:23,783 --> 00:35:24,240
Scott: I don't like that.

618
00:35:24,561 --> 00:35:33,660
Scott: But if you just take the fish and you just decrease that fishy level to the point at which I can eat it without being like, "Ew," even though I might be like, "Eh," right?

619
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:44,220
Scott: And that, I guess, is the food that I like the least because you can just adjust that level of fishiness to the point at which I will eat it to not go hungry rather than be hungry, but I'm still not happy.

620
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,499
Scott: I would rather eat something else.

621
00:35:45,741 --> 00:35:50,673
Rym: I think my line is not the Arby's roast beef sandwich because I will never eat one of those again in my life.

622
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,060
Scott: See, the thing is, I love Arby's, but at Arby's, I do not eat roast beef at all.

623
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:54,207
Scott: Ew.

624
00:35:54,644 --> 00:35:55,468
Scott: I would not eat -- I used to.

625
00:35:56,022 --> 00:35:56,979
Rym: I used to every day.

626
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,800
Rym: Remember, kids, when we were young -- I would eat McDonald's before I ate the roast beef at Arby's.

627
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,540
Rym: When I was in high school, like sophomore year, I would drive.

628
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:13,760
Rym: I'd just walk out of the school around lunchtime, drive to the mall, go to the Arby's in the mall, and eat like a roast beef sandwich and some curly fries and a Jamoca shake.

629
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:14,839
Rym: And that was my lunch.

630
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:21,039
Scott: At Arby's, the thing is, I would go right now to an Arby's to eat -- The chicken fingers.

631
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,360
Scott: The chicken fingers and, of course, the curly fry.

632
00:36:23,841 --> 00:36:24,140
Scott: Curly fries.

633
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:30,160
Scott: Because while that curly fry isn't, say, really any different than McDonald's fry, it does have, A, a little bit more potato.

634
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,220
Rym: Two, it's got flavor powder, which you seem to hate in other contexts.

635
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:38,380
Scott: B, a curly shape, and C, a flavor that is not just oil and salt.

636
00:36:40,902 --> 00:36:48,220
Rym: I think the line for me, in terms of quality and type combined, is I would order Arby's chicken fingers and curly fries.

637
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,020
Rym: I would eat that rather than go hungry.

638
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,600
Scott: Even though those fried chicken fingers have a very small amount of chicken.

639
00:36:53,183 --> 00:36:54,480
Scott: They're way better than a chicken McNugget.

640
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:55,937
Rym: Way better.

641
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,320
Rym: But anything -- I would not eat a fast food worse than that for dinner.

642
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,220
Rym: But I consider a White Castle burger to be better than that.

643
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,660
Scott: I would not eat almost anything at White Castle.

644
00:37:05,701 --> 00:37:06,938
Rym: I'd eat a White Castle burger right now.

645
00:37:07,187 --> 00:37:07,273
Rym: No.

646
00:37:07,785 --> 00:37:09,180
Rym: Like, I would just eat that on purpose.

647
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:09,680
Rym: No.

648
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,780
Rym: In a non-dire situation, I would eat a White Castle.

649
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:13,146
Rym: No.

650
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:19,320
Rym: The only reason I don't, honestly, is that all the White Castles in New York are disgusting.

651
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,040
Scott: The one near me went out of business, and so there was a regional office also here.

652
00:37:23,281 --> 00:37:23,919
Scott: It also went closed.

653
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:28,240
Scott: The last time I ate at a White Castle -- There's a cool building over there that still has a castle on the corner of it.

654
00:37:28,361 --> 00:37:29,180
Rym: I went to one in the Bronx.

655
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,040
Scott: It used to be the regional office.

656
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,400
Rym: I went to one -- I worked at the hospital.

657
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,660
Rym: I went to one in the Bronx that was kind of near one of my offices.

658
00:37:35,463 --> 00:37:40,860
Rym: And, like, the interior of it, one, had, like, bulletproof glass and a metal detector and a cop.

659
00:37:41,621 --> 00:37:43,460
Rym: And then inside of it, it was filthy.

660
00:37:44,601 --> 00:37:51,880
Rym: And I ate there once, and I vowed to never eat there again because the environment was too disgusting.

661
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:56,840
Rym: But otherwise, I like the sensation of eating a White Castle burger.

662
00:37:57,763 --> 00:38:00,280
Rym: But I would not eat a McDonald's burger under any circumstances.

663
00:38:00,823 --> 00:38:01,760
Rym: I would definitely go hungry.

664
00:38:01,921 --> 00:38:07,260
Scott: Well, some people in our chat have mentioned Taco Bell, a place that I will never eat.

665
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,719
Scott: Taco Bell is okay, though.

666
00:38:09,023 --> 00:38:09,559
Scott: I will not eat it.

667
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:16,020
Rym: Taco Bell is just a low-quality but perfectly serviceable taco that arguably probably doesn't have much meat in it, if any meat.

668
00:38:16,181 --> 00:38:17,098
Scott: I will not eat a Taco Bell.

669
00:38:17,523 --> 00:38:18,240
Rym: I would eat a Taco Bell.

670
00:38:18,342 --> 00:38:18,698
Rym: I would not.

671
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,266
Rym: Why not?

672
00:38:19,368 --> 00:38:20,020
Scott: Taco Bell's fine.

673
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:25,460
Scott: I mean, there are places I would eat -- I would rather sooner eat Taco Bell than White Castle, but that doesn't mean I will eat Taco Bell.

674
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:32,180
Rym: Taco Bell is higher-quality food stuff than White Castle.

675
00:38:33,206 --> 00:38:34,400
Rym: The ingredients are fine.

676
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,270
Scott: But I still won't eat there.

677
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,100
Scott: It's still below the line.

678
00:38:36,722 --> 00:38:37,510
Media: I'd say it's above the line.

679
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,440
Rym: I would eat at a Taco Bell.

680
00:38:38,581 --> 00:38:40,159
Scott: It's just closer to the line than White Castle is.

681
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,474
Rym: I'd eat at a Taco Bell before I'd go hungry, but I would not eat at most.

682
00:38:44,554 --> 00:38:46,280
Rym: gennaro delis in midtown Manhattan.

683
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,619
Scott: Depends on what I get at the gennaro deli.

684
00:38:50,024 --> 00:38:50,940
Rym: The one by Grand Central?

685
00:38:51,466 --> 00:38:52,020
Scott: I don't know which one.

686
00:38:52,161 --> 00:38:52,696
Scott: The big one?

687
00:38:53,323 --> 00:38:53,939
Scott: I don't know which one.

688
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:54,552
Rym: On 41st Street?

689
00:38:55,521 --> 00:38:58,060
Rym: We've walked past this place many times in our lives.

690
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,319
Scott: There's a lot of gennaro delis.

691
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,280
Rym: But every time we've walked past this one, you've always pointed it out and said we should never eat there.

692
00:39:03,781 --> 00:39:04,007
Scott: Maybe.

693
00:39:04,027 --> 00:39:04,500
Scott: I don't know.

694
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,276
Rym: You don't remember this?

695
00:39:05,523 --> 00:39:05,631
Rym: No.

696
00:39:06,082 --> 00:39:06,258
Rym: Okay.

697
00:39:07,543 --> 00:39:08,720
Rym: It's called the stage doors.

698
00:39:09,361 --> 00:39:12,600
Rym: It's on 41st and Pershing Square.

699
00:39:15,123 --> 00:39:16,900
Rym: I feel like the next time we walk by, I'm going to point it out.

700
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,640
Rym: I would not eat there under any circumstances.

701
00:39:19,161 --> 00:39:21,480
Rym: I've also seen it closed down by the health department multiple times.

702
00:39:22,245 --> 00:39:24,016
Scott: I won't eat at a place that I know has issues.

703
00:39:25,602 --> 00:39:29,300
Scott: In New York City, it's a lot easier to know when places have issues because they have a grading system going on.

704
00:39:30,531 --> 00:39:31,360
Scott: Some places don't have that.

705
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,079
Rym: Here's a question.

706
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,200
Rym: What is the worst food you've ever eaten on purpose?

707
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,193
Scott: What do you mean?

708
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:38,899
Scott: Unhealthiest?

709
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,520
Rym: Whatever you mean by worst.

710
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:45,780
Rym: The worst food you've eaten on purpose in your whole life or in your adult life?

711
00:39:46,403 --> 00:39:47,940
Scott: There have been a couple times.

712
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,719
Rym: Because as a kid, I would eat Cheetos.

713
00:39:50,526 --> 00:39:52,340
Rym: I like Cheetos and Doritos.

714
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,379
Scott: There have been times where we deep fried various things and ate them.

715
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:08,720
Scott: There are also times, I think at least a couple times in my youth where you've played that game where you combine a bunch of beverages into some concoction and dare people to drink it and someone sips it and it's whatever.

716
00:40:09,061 --> 00:40:11,800
Rym: I only ever played that game in the context of watching other people do it.

717
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,340
Rym: I was never dumb enough to do it myself.

718
00:40:14,523 --> 00:40:16,240
Scott: I don't remember really the details.

719
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,419
Scott: I just remember it being a thing.

720
00:40:18,642 --> 00:40:19,660
Scott: Because I have specific memories.

721
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:29,060
Rym: The worst food I ever put in my mouth on purpose was that off-brand big boy on the New York State Thruway on that terrible trip we took to Rochester that one time.

722
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:35,000
Rym: To this day, that meal stands out as the worst food I've ever put in my mouth on purpose in my entire life.

723
00:40:35,061 --> 00:40:35,619
Rym: It was not good.

724
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,899
Rym: It filled my stomach, but it did not sate me.

725
00:40:40,361 --> 00:40:42,760
Rym: It's like in Chrono Trigger, but you're still hungry.

726
00:40:43,184 --> 00:40:44,057
Rym: I just felt worse.

727
00:40:44,882 --> 00:40:50,360
Scott: I mean, I have eaten at McDonald's, Burger King, and such in the past, just the very, very deep past.

728
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,283
Rym: When was the last time?

729
00:40:51,303 --> 00:40:55,480
Rym: Because I ate a McDonald's breakfast occasionally when I ski.

730
00:40:56,282 --> 00:40:58,000
Rym: The last time I ate a McDonald's burger?

731
00:40:59,061 --> 00:41:00,739
Scott: The last time I ate a McDonald's...

732
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,841
Rym: I think was before the year 2000.

733
00:41:04,841 --> 00:41:04,988
Scott: Maybe...

734
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:06,520
Rym: It was definitely high school.

735
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,019
Scott: So in the year 2000, I ate ice cream from a McDonald's in Israel.

736
00:41:11,242 --> 00:41:12,892
Scott: And in my seventh grade, I ate...

737
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,759
Rym: Nando's chicken is perfectly fine.

738
00:41:17,463 --> 00:41:19,600
Scott: Why would you not eat at Nando's?

739
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:24,020
Rym: I would eat Nando's chicken before I would eat at any other fast food restaurant on earth.

740
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,839
Scott: Yeah, I would give up Chipotle before I give up Nando's.

741
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,278
Rym: I avoid Chipotle.

742
00:41:29,544 --> 00:41:30,100
Scott: I go to Chipotle.

743
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,631
Rym: When I go to Chipotle, I never get meat.

744
00:41:31,772 --> 00:41:32,780
Rym: I only get the sofritas.

745
00:41:33,361 --> 00:41:34,365
Scott: I like sofritas.

746
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,840
Scott: I get them the most, but I also get other things, like the limited-time chorizo.

747
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,020
Scott: They're trying to make it the big rib of Chipotle, the big rib of Chipotle.

748
00:41:42,722 --> 00:41:43,700
Scott: It's a good strategy.

749
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,240
Scott: But it's not McRib.

750
00:41:45,642 --> 00:41:46,359
Scott: Which I would not eat.

751
00:41:47,762 --> 00:41:53,980
Rym: The worst thing I ever put in my mouth ever, though, on purpose was... I like energy drinks, but remember when there was that cocaine energy drink?

752
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:54,999
Scott: Oh, right, you tried that.

753
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,239
Scott: Didn't you try the Four Loko also?

754
00:41:57,761 --> 00:41:59,191
Rym: Four Loko didn't actually taste bad.

755
00:41:59,252 --> 00:42:00,279
Rym: It's just bad for you.

756
00:42:00,521 --> 00:42:01,219
Scott: You tasted it, though.

757
00:42:01,362 --> 00:42:02,120
Rym: Yeah, it tasted fine.

758
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,179
Rym: You know what it tasted like?

759
00:42:04,621 --> 00:42:08,480
Rym: It tasted like a bad 40 mixed with a Red Bull.

760
00:42:09,123 --> 00:42:12,760
Scott: Oh, one time, I was drinking some apple juice.

761
00:42:13,905 --> 00:42:15,900
Scott: It was just grocery store brand apple juice.

762
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:20,940
Scott: But I didn't notice until I sipped it that it had something growing in there.

763
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:21,544
Scott: Ooh, ooh.

764
00:42:23,102 --> 00:42:30,060
Scott: There was some sort of solid, floaty, cloudy mass in the cup at the bottom.

765
00:42:30,861 --> 00:42:33,416
Scott: But also, it tasted like poison.

766
00:42:35,382 --> 00:42:37,576
Rym: Yeah, so I like Red Bull.

767
00:42:37,636 --> 00:42:38,280
Rym: I like energy drinks.

768
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,388
Scott: I didn't drink much of it.

769
00:42:39,469 --> 00:42:40,340
Scott: I just was like bleh.

770
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,997
Rym: So I bought that cocaine energy drink because I was like, "Okay, it's just like another energy drink.

771
00:42:45,037 --> 00:42:45,539
Rym: I will try

772
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:45,620
Rym: it.".

773
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,580
Rym: And when I opened the can, I could smell it a little bit.

774
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,576
Rym: And part of my brain said, "This is

775
00:42:51,697 --> 00:42:52,159
Rym: poison.".

776
00:42:53,043 --> 00:42:54,374
Rym: I suppressed that little part of my brain.

777
00:42:54,394 --> 00:42:55,020
Rym: I took one sip.

778
00:42:55,861 --> 00:43:01,280
Rym: It tasted the worst... It was the worst taste I have ever experienced in my entire life.

779
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,400
Rym: That big boy meal tasted like sadness.

780
00:43:05,081 --> 00:43:06,299
Rym: This tasted like death.

781
00:43:07,402 --> 00:43:10,259
Rym: I literally spit it out and I threw it away.

782
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:11,918
Rym: And I never looked back.

783
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,780
Scott: One time in a dim sum, was it Mike Lynn?

784
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,706
Scott: He was like, "Hey, hey, hey.

785
00:43:16,987 --> 00:43:19,758
Scott: I'll try to get these white people to eat weird foods at the dim

786
00:43:19,778 --> 00:43:19,999
Scott: sum.".

787
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,406
Rym: That didn't work on us.

788
00:43:21,466 --> 00:43:23,778
Rym: I'd bite each one and be like, "I don't like this, but

789
00:43:23,858 --> 00:43:24,119
Rym: okay.".

790
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:24,885
Rym: So he got pig's ear.

791
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,487
Rym: Pig's ear's okay.

792
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:28,700
Rym: I like to nibble on a pig's ear.

793
00:43:28,921 --> 00:43:32,360
Scott: So I nibbled on the pig's ear and it tasted like pork, which is fine.

794
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,386
Scott: It tasted just fine.

795
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:37,520
Scott: The problem is it was so fucking chewy, I could not chew it to a point at which I could swallow it.

796
00:43:38,541 --> 00:43:39,808
Rym: That's the same problem I had with tripe.

797
00:43:39,989 --> 00:43:41,135
Rym: I do not like tripe.

798
00:43:41,196 --> 00:43:41,940
Rym: I will not eat tripe.

799
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,020
Scott: Then I had a tasteless mass of cartilage in my mouth.

800
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,960
Scott: Then I spit it out after I had extracted all of the pork flavor.

801
00:43:48,261 --> 00:43:49,760
Scott: Tripe tastes good, but it's basically just...

802
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,506
Rym: It's like meat gum.

803
00:43:51,586 --> 00:43:54,360
Rym: If I could treat it like gum but spit it out, I'd probably eat more tripe.

804
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:57,620
Scott: That also happens to me sometimes with very poorly cooked steaks.

805
00:43:57,984 --> 00:43:59,019
Scott: I'll chew them.

806
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,677
Rym: Then you get that little meat gum remainder.

807
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:07,139
Scott: I get some part of it, or maybe the whole thing if it's real bad, where I cannot chew it sufficiently to the point where I can swallow it.

808
00:44:07,361 --> 00:44:08,539
Rym: You spit it into a napkin and bite it.

809
00:44:08,943 --> 00:44:10,880
Scott: All of the meat flavor has been extracted.

810
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:14,340
Scott: Then I spit out this gray mass into a napkin.

811
00:44:14,801 --> 00:44:16,760
Rym: Yup, I've done the gray mass into the napkin before.

812
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,434
Scott: It's like, "Well, this isn't a good

813
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:18,697
Scott: steak.".

814
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,299
Rym: You know where I would commonly do that?

815
00:44:20,681 --> 00:44:23,460
Rym: With about 10% of a steak on French bread.

816
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,060
Scott: Actually, I never had that problem with steak on French bread.

817
00:44:27,221 --> 00:44:27,664
Rym: Usually not.

818
00:44:27,684 --> 00:44:30,079
Rym: There'd always be a little bit, but sometimes I just swallow it.

819
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,286
Rym: It was near the line.

820
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,620
Rym: That steak on French bread was probably the best value per dollar of food we had in our entire lives.

821
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,020
Rym: This chat's got a lot of opinions.

822
00:44:43,022 --> 00:44:44,800
Scott: People like food shows for some reason.

823
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,273
Rym: I don't understand anti-nando sentiment.

824
00:44:47,293 --> 00:44:48,380
Rym: Nando's is pretty good.

825
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,780
Scott: If you like food shows so much, send us more food show ideas for Thursday.

826
00:44:55,042 --> 00:45:15,636
Rym: One thing I've noticed, though, is that as I've gotten not just older, and not even necessarily wealthier, but living in places where I have more access to better quality food, irrespective of price, if I go to a crapo Chinese place in Flushing, it's really high-quality Chinese food that's very flavorful.

827
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:21,940
Rym: I can't eat the non-flavorful Chinese food in Michigan.

828
00:45:22,901 --> 00:45:24,999
Scott: But if you had only lived in Michigan, you could.

829
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:25,742
Rym: Yeah, I could.

830
00:45:25,822 --> 00:45:30,260
Rym: I used to eat Chinese food that by my modern palate tastes like nothing.

831
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,980
Rym: It tastes like just MSG on cardboard.

832
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,098
Scott: You can't eat Seattle pizza.

833
00:45:34,904 --> 00:45:36,260
Scott: You can't eat Dunkin' Donuts bagel.

834
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:36,642
Scott: Nope.

835
00:45:36,905 --> 00:45:38,240
Rym: I can't eat a Dunkin' Donuts donut.

836
00:45:39,202 --> 00:45:40,259
Scott: I can eat a Dunkin' Donuts donut.

837
00:45:40,601 --> 00:45:42,620
Rym: When was the last time you ate a Dunkin' Donuts donut?

838
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,097
Rym: This year.

839
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,460
Rym: They are not worth eating.

840
00:45:45,581 --> 00:45:48,420
Rym: I would go hungry before I'd eat a Dunkin' Donuts donut.

841
00:45:48,722 --> 00:45:49,065
Rym: I'm out.

842
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:49,874
Scott: I'm biking.

843
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:50,440
Scott: It's morning.

844
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,650
Scott: I want some sugar.

845
00:45:51,812 --> 00:45:52,094
Scott: Oh, look.

846
00:45:52,114 --> 00:45:52,780
Scott: They're selling sugar.

847
00:45:53,465 --> 00:45:54,039
Rym: I'll buy it.

848
00:45:54,281 --> 00:45:54,778
Rym: Scott, it's New York.

849
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,979
Rym: There's probably a real donut within like a half a mile of wherever you are.

850
00:45:59,321 --> 00:45:59,908
Scott: In New Jersey.

851
00:46:00,212 --> 00:46:00,719
Scott: The biking group.

852
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,660
Scott: The biking group stops at the Dunkin' Donuts.

853
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,399
Scott: You should have brought food with you.

854
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,640
Scott: I did, but I wanted to buy a sugar other than the sugar I was carrying.

855
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,100
Rym: Dunkin' Donuts, I would go hungry.

856
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,179
Rym: You know, back to our scenario.

857
00:46:11,481 --> 00:46:14,680
Rym: I would go hungry and skip dinner rather than eat Dunkin' Donuts food.

858
00:46:16,062 --> 00:46:17,375
Scott: A donut is just a sugar ring.

859
00:46:17,436 --> 00:46:17,820
Scott: It's fine.

860
00:46:18,161 --> 00:46:19,580
Rym: Yeah, I don't need the sugar ring.

861
00:46:20,103 --> 00:46:22,880
Rym: I will not eat a sugar ring that tastes like just sugar and ring.

862
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,579
Scott: That's what it tastes like.

863
00:46:25,262 --> 00:46:28,880
Rym: Yeah, it tastes like a ring of cardboard with sugar on it.

864
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,254
Scott: No, it's just sugar and it tastes fine.

865
00:46:30,274 --> 00:46:30,800
Scott: It tastes like sugar.

866
00:46:31,141 --> 00:46:31,739
Scott: Sugar tastes great.

867
00:46:33,242 --> 00:46:33,839
Rym: It's unsatisfying.

868
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:35,350
Scott: It's not like it's hard or anything.

869
00:46:35,391 --> 00:46:36,440
Scott: The bagel tastes like nothing.

870
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,200
Scott: The bagel I won't eat.

871
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:39,620
Rym: I can't eat just a bagel that's just bread.

872
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,380
Rym: It's like, alright, this is basically just Wonder Bread in the shape of a bagel.

873
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,580
Scott: Yeah, I will not eat a bread ring, but I will eat a sugar ring.

874
00:46:45,442 --> 00:46:46,640
Rym: I won't eat a sugar ring anymore.

875
00:46:46,923 --> 00:46:47,660
Scott: Alright, don't.

876
00:46:47,922 --> 00:46:48,507
Rym: I just can't.

877
00:46:48,607 --> 00:46:50,119
Rym: It just doesn't satisfy me.

878
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:50,700
Rym: Don't think.

879
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,719
Rym: I feel better by avoiding it than eating it.

880
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:53,136
Scott: Okay.

881
00:46:54,283 --> 00:46:54,776
Scott: Do what you gotta do.

882
00:46:55,641 --> 00:46:57,399
Rym: Yeah, that's why I'm gonna come and avoid Dunkin' Donuts.

883
00:46:57,804 --> 00:46:58,060
Scott: Okay.

884
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:00,659
Rym: Alright, I think we might have killed enough time.

885
00:47:01,762 --> 00:47:02,660
Scott: Mustn't kill time, boy.

886
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:03,619
Scott: Cherish it.

887
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,759
Scott: You must cherish the sugar ring.

888
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,127
Rym: Alright, I guess the last thing.

889
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:07,680
Rym: What are the foods you just don't like?

890
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:09,340
Rym: Like, let's just try to list the foods we don't like.

891
00:47:10,082 --> 00:47:11,353
Rym: Neither one of us are picky eaters.

892
00:47:11,554 --> 00:47:12,240
Rym: We eat a lot.

893
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,500
Scott: There are foods that I like or might like but won't eat.

894
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,860
Scott: Actually, I've never tried it, but I'm pretty sure shark fin soup probably tastes good.

895
00:47:20,362 --> 00:47:22,133
Scott: So, my guess would be that it tastes great.

896
00:47:22,415 --> 00:47:23,160
Scott: I will not eat that.

897
00:47:23,561 --> 00:47:27,300
Rym: It's been served to me, and I have a rule generally that...

898
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:31,099
Scott: I know that foie gras tastes great because I've had it, but I'm not gonna order it.

899
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:43,260
Rym: It has been served to me, and my rule is, if I have ethical concerns about a food, but unbeknownst to me and without my input, it is prepared for me, I will usually eat it so it doesn't go to waste.

900
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,280
Rym: And in those cases, in that context, I have had rabbit, even though I don't want to eat rabbit.

901
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,118
Rym: I have had shark fin soup, even though I don't want shark fin soup.

902
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:52,829
Rym: Was it good?

903
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:53,379
Scott: I haven't had it.

904
00:47:53,641 --> 00:47:54,839
Rym: No, it was kind of bland.

905
00:47:56,283 --> 00:47:57,419
Scott: I've been told it was rich.

906
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,836
Rym: Well, yeah, you can make it rich, but I've had better soups.

907
00:48:00,876 --> 00:48:01,238
Rym: It wasn't...

908
00:48:01,902 --> 00:48:04,277
Scott: Did you have a bad shark fin soup or shark fin soup?

909
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:04,640
Scott: just bad?

910
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:10,260
Rym: This was shark fin soup served to me illicitly in Hong Kong at a rich person's thing.

911
00:48:10,447 --> 00:48:10,719
Scott: Okay.

912
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:14,720
Rym: It was good, but it was not good enough to justify the cruelty.

913
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:15,879
Scott: It wasn't foie gras good.

914
00:48:16,941 --> 00:48:20,980
Rym: So foie gras has been served to me twice without me ordering it in my adult life.

915
00:48:21,301 --> 00:48:33,520
Rym: One time, Emily and I were at a super fancy French restaurant having a very expensive, fancy date night, and the waiter just comes over and hands us something and puts it on the table, and it's a pâté of some kind and walks away.

916
00:48:34,382 --> 00:48:37,099
Rym: And we just both assume, "All right, I guess they just serve this to

917
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:37,260
Rym: us.".

918
00:48:37,763 --> 00:48:40,080
Rym: We immediately eat it, because it wasn't that much.

919
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,080
Rym: It was one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten in my life.

920
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,691
Rym: The waiter comes back and is like, "Oh, sorry, that was for another tête,".

921
00:48:47,193 --> 00:48:48,940
Rym: and it's gone, because we've already eaten it.

922
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:54,220
Rym: We've eaten it in the 30 seconds before we realize he delivered this very expensive foie gras to the wrong table.

923
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,423
Rym: We just ate it.

924
00:48:56,127 --> 00:48:58,260
Rym: He was a little miffed that we just ate it.

925
00:48:58,460 --> 00:48:58,925
Scott: Why wouldn't you?

926
00:48:58,965 --> 00:49:00,299
Scott: You put food on my table, I eat it.

927
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:00,610
Rym: Yup.

928
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:05,640
Rym: And it was really, really, really, really, really delicious.

929
00:49:05,921 --> 00:49:06,297
Rym: Of course.

930
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,240
Rym: But I will never order foie gras.

931
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,320
Scott: It's a fatty goose liver.

932
00:49:10,701 --> 00:49:19,980
Rym: If I ever had to make an exception, I would be willing to entertain ordering foie gras if I knew that it was hunted as opposed to farmed.

933
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:20,839
Scott: It won't taste as good.

934
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:22,879
Rym: It would arguably taste better.

935
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,579
Scott: Just like veal won't taste as good.

936
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:30,520
Rym: Yeah, I try to avoid eating veal, but it ends up being one of many ingredients in many Italian dishes.

937
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,086
Scott: Like a meatball that has veal in it?

938
00:49:35,442 --> 00:49:37,460
Rym: I will never order a veal by itself.

939
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,200
Scott: I try to avoid eating veal.

940
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,400
Scott: I haven't eaten it probably in years, unless it's been, say, in a meatball.

941
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:52,500
Scott: But I will, super rarely, as in less than once a year, order a veal because it tastes real good and it's less evil than foie gras while still being very evil.

942
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,152
Rym: At least farmed foie gras is awful.

943
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,400
Scott: It is less evil than a nortolin bunting, which I won't eat.

944
00:49:57,641 --> 00:49:59,220
Rym: I would never eat a nortolin bunting.

945
00:50:00,102 --> 00:50:11,860
Rym: I would consider de-friending someone or disowning a family member who ate nortolin bunting because that just feels like it's done for the sake of being awful.

946
00:50:12,244 --> 00:50:12,375
Scott: It is.

947
00:50:12,762 --> 00:50:12,870
Rym: Yeah.

948
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,340
Scott: You're exactly right.

949
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:14,960
Rym: It can't be good.

950
00:50:15,462 --> 00:50:21,560
Rym: If you like Armagnac so much and you want to have this experience, just get a regular pheasant and cook it in Armagnac.

951
00:50:21,943 --> 00:50:22,980
Rym: It's not going to be different.

952
00:50:23,241 --> 00:50:25,240
Scott: I won't eat anything that's too smart like dolphin.

953
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,500
Scott: I won't eat anything harmful like a monkey brain.

954
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,740
Scott: I won't eat an octopus because it's too smart.

955
00:50:30,921 --> 00:50:31,720
Rym: So I have a problem.

956
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,320
Scott: I also won't eat squid tentacles even though squids are stupid.

957
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,340
Rym: They're not as stupid as people say, Scott.

958
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:38,920
Rym: I've learned some things about squid.

959
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,719
Scott: Yes, but they're stupider than an octopus.

960
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,900
Rym: Arguably, they're similarly intelligent in a different way.

961
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,529
Scott: Either way, I'm not eating them.

962
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:52,959
Scott: so it doesn't matter why I don't eat them because the tentacles, even regardless of their smartness, tentacles are just too damn chewy.

963
00:50:53,382 --> 00:50:55,040
Rym: That's just because you got bad ones like scallops.

964
00:50:55,261 --> 00:51:02,060
Rym: You don't like mediocre to average or even above average scallops, but I know you for a fact like good scallops.

965
00:51:02,161 --> 00:51:03,580
Scott: Well, at least the scallop isn't smart at all.

966
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,939
Scott: It's just a shell that opens and closes.

967
00:51:06,201 --> 00:51:07,880
Scott: As far as I know, a scallop is dumb as a brick.

968
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,099
Scott: It just opens and closes.

969
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:10,336
Rym: So all I'm going to tell you...

970
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:11,978
Scott: And it's a little white blob that shimmies.

971
00:51:13,181 --> 00:51:13,960
Scott: It doesn't do anything.

972
00:51:14,181 --> 00:51:15,240
Rym: You can use this information...

973
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,680
Scott: You can't open a lock like an octopus.

974
00:51:17,021 --> 00:51:18,060
Rym: I provide you information.

975
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:19,159
Rym: You can use it as you see fit.

976
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,553
Rym: Octopus tentacle that is good.

977
00:51:21,654 --> 00:51:30,040
Rym: octopus tentacle is as good and as different from regular octopus tentacle as the good scallop is from the regular scallop.

978
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:32,300
Scott: I'm still not eating a takoyaki even though it's probably fucking delicious.

979
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,640
Rym: Takoyaki is so good.

980
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,540
Scott: I'm not eating it because...

981
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:35,440
Rym: It's one of my favorite foods.

982
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:36,620
Scott: It's made of octopus.

983
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:37,899
Rym: Yeah, but it's so good.

984
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:41,500
Scott: Find me a proven dumbass octopus.

985
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:42,399
Scott: Maybe I'll try one.

986
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,640
Rym: Yeah, just jerk octopus.

987
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,318
Rym: Like find one who specifically did something bad.

988
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:47,200
Scott: Oh, like yeah, even though it's smart, we can see...

989
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,260
Rym: Find one who committed a crime.

990
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:50,620
Rym: If they're smart enough, they know the difference between good and evil.

991
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,070
Scott: Even though it's smart, we can see.

992
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,458
Scott: this is clearly a bad octopus that deserved to be eaten.

993
00:51:56,788 --> 00:51:57,400
Rym: I won't eat natto.

994
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,319
Rym: That shit's disgusting.

995
00:51:58,884 --> 00:51:59,499
Scott: Yeah, it smells bad.

996
00:51:59,781 --> 00:52:00,578
Rym: I won't eat vegemite.

997
00:52:00,761 --> 00:52:01,480
Rym: That shit's disgusting.

998
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,097
Rym: I ate it once.

999
00:52:02,641 --> 00:52:04,500
Rym: It doesn't taste good, so I don't need it anymore.

1000
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:06,080
Rym: I've tried vegemite.

1001
00:52:06,303 --> 00:52:07,100
Rym: I've tried marmite.

1002
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:08,358
Rym: Marmite is a...

1003
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,700
Scott: I haven't tried the marmite.

1004
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:16,618
Rym: Imagine vegemite, but like grosser and more gooey.

1005
00:52:17,463 --> 00:52:18,138
Scott: I'm not eating that.

1006
00:52:18,482 --> 00:52:19,160
Rym: Like bitter.

1007
00:52:20,201 --> 00:52:20,880
Rym: Like runnier.

1008
00:52:21,422 --> 00:52:23,160
Rym: Like imagine runny vegemite.

1009
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:23,780
Scott: That is worse.

1010
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,340
Rym: It is so gross.

1011
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:26,139
Scott: I will not eat that.

1012
00:52:28,083 --> 00:52:30,720
Rym: Because I had vegemite before and you hadn't when we were in Australia.

1013
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,319
Rym: And you really wanted to try it.

1014
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,160
Scott: I was in Australia.

1015
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:33,776
Scott: That's the thing to do.

1016
00:52:34,361 --> 00:52:34,960
Scott: You know what I learned?

1017
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,040
Scott: If you go to Australia, Pat, you don't need to worry about the vegemite.

1018
00:52:39,001 --> 00:52:40,239
Scott: You just got to get the Tim Tams.

1019
00:52:40,821 --> 00:52:43,620
Scott: Tim Tams are the thing you want from Australia, not vegemite.

1020
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,979
Scott: They should really decrease their telling tourists about vegemite, which I think they do just as like a trap.

1021
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,839
Scott: And they should increase telling tourists about Tim Tams.

1022
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:55,558
Rym: But even then, the real secret of Australia is the big brekkie.

1023
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:57,217
Rym: Tim Tam.

1024
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,259
Rym: Tim Tams are okay.

1025
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:05,680
Rym: Tim Tams are like... They're basically like... They're equivalent of some of that New Jersey, Pennsylvania high food that we enjoy.

1026
00:53:06,661 --> 00:53:08,340
Rym: Or at least that Dave Riley and Joel White enjoy.

1027
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:12,780
Rym: In fact, I remember you, me, and Sherba went to that grocery store to buy that vegemite.

1028
00:53:13,402 --> 00:53:14,860
Scott: I'm the one who wanted to go to a grocery store.

1029
00:53:15,243 --> 00:53:16,900
Scott: I always like to go to a grocery store wherever I go.

1030
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:21,120
Scott: I went to the grocery store in Aruba, went to the grocery store in Australia, grocery store in Israel.

1031
00:53:22,182 --> 00:53:24,059
Scott: If I'm coming to your country, I'm going to the grocery store.

1032
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:25,520
Rym: I don't like tripe, like I said.

1033
00:53:25,701 --> 00:53:26,715
Rym: I just don't enjoy tripe.

1034
00:53:28,543 --> 00:53:30,440
Rym: I don't like chicken feet and all those kinds of things.

1035
00:53:31,021 --> 00:53:32,297
Rym: I'll eat them, I just don't like them.

1036
00:53:33,341 --> 00:53:35,840
Scott: Chicken feet, I'll eat it, but I won't order it.

1037
00:53:36,081 --> 00:53:37,020
Rym: Yeah, I don't like them.

1038
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,260
Rym: But if they're there, I might eat a couple.

1039
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:38,736
Scott: I'm down with it.

1040
00:53:39,021 --> 00:53:41,020
Scott: You order some chicken feet and dim sum, it's like I'll bite one.

1041
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:41,595
Rym: I'll eat a little bit.

1042
00:53:42,781 --> 00:53:44,920
Rym: But there's not that many foods I don't like.

1043
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,079
Rym: It's a pretty short list.

1044
00:53:46,303 --> 00:53:47,260
Scott: I'll eat almost any food.

1045
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,460
Scott: It's just beverages, I'm very limited in the beverage department.

1046
00:53:49,801 --> 00:53:51,059
Rym: Yeah, I'll drink a lot of things too.

1047
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,080
Rym: I got this really good dog cushion.

1048
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,288
Scott: Oh, you know what I don't like.

1049
00:53:54,308 --> 00:53:55,919
Scott: that is a normal food that other people like?

1050
00:53:56,485 --> 00:53:57,100
Scott: Is artichoke.

1051
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:57,817
Scott: I don't like artichoke.

1052
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,619
Rym: What the fuck is wrong with you?

1053
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,117
Rym: Tastes bad.

1054
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,719
Rym: I don't know, artichoke is one of my favorite foods.

1055
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:03,377
Scott: Tastes bad.

1056
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:04,580
Rym: Don't eat it.

1057
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:06,740
Rym: Like artichokes and brussels sprouts and all those things?

1058
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:07,480
Scott: Brussels sprout is great.

1059
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:08,840
Scott: Brussels sprout is the best.

1060
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:11,160
Scott: Brussels sprout is like top tier vegetable.

1061
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,380
Rym: Have you ever had, what about artichoke dip?

1062
00:54:13,862 --> 00:54:14,390
Scott: No, it's also bad.

1063
00:54:16,148 --> 00:54:17,019
Rym: But you like guacamole?

1064
00:54:18,362 --> 00:54:19,279
Scott: Tastes nothing like artichoke.

1065
00:54:20,001 --> 00:54:22,194
Rym: Okay, yeah, but they're a similar type of food.

1066
00:54:22,234 --> 00:54:23,180
Rym: in the end, artichoke dip.

1067
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,820
Rym: I guess artichoke dip is more like spinach dip and less like guacamole.

1068
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:27,578
Scott: Spinach dip's okay.

1069
00:54:27,842 --> 00:54:28,180
Scott: I like spinach.

1070
00:54:28,282 --> 00:54:28,835
Rym: I like spinach a lot.

1071
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:29,639
Rym: I'll eat spinach.

1072
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:34,220
Rym: As a kid, I would eat like a quarter pound of spinach dip by myself.

1073
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:43,920
Scott: I try to avoid eating raw spinach and raw kale that has not been cooked because in addition to the bacterial disease E. coli problems of eating just any uncooked vegetable.

1074
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,459
Rym: Yeah, listen to our friend Pete, cook your lettuce.

1075
00:54:46,023 --> 00:54:46,880
Scott: Cook all vegetables.

1076
00:54:47,883 --> 00:54:49,960
Scott: It has the additional problem of fucking up your stomach.

1077
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:55,939
Rym: So, it doesn't actually, from what I've read, it doesn't actually cause that problem more than a lot of other cooked foods?

1078
00:54:56,429 --> 00:54:56,640
Scott: Yeah.

1079
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,020
Rym: The danger's overblown.

1080
00:54:59,184 --> 00:55:00,240
Scott: It's still more than zero.

1081
00:55:00,441 --> 00:55:01,099
Scott: My stomach is-.

1082
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,200
Rym: Well, spinach is also really good.

1083
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,138
Rym: Like, I really enjoy it.

1084
00:55:04,183 --> 00:55:04,517
Scott: It's all right.

1085
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:05,136
Rym: Yeah.

1086
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,820
Scott: Nothing's gotten, really no lettuce can really compare with arugula.

1087
00:55:09,281 --> 00:55:10,480
Scott: Arugula is the king of lettuce.

1088
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,320
Rym: I really, really don't like American cheese because it doesn't taste like anything.

1089
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,040
Scott: Depends, right?

1090
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:19,040
Scott: So, if you go and you get, say, Kraft Slice at Singles, those taste like nothing.

1091
00:55:19,861 --> 00:55:28,980
Rym: Why would you ever eat American cheese when Colby exists, Colby Jack exists, Jack exists, Cheddar exists, Havarti exists?

1092
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:37,540
Scott: If you go to the deli counter and you ask for, say, I guess the minimum American cheese that has flavor would be Land O'Lakes American.

1093
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:48,500
Rym: But I'm saying the highest quality American cheese from the best deli in the world is still mediocre compared to even like an average Cheddar or an average Monterey Jack.

1094
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,260
Scott: You can get good American cheese.

1095
00:55:50,561 --> 00:55:51,239
Scott: It has a flavor.

1096
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:58,158
Rym: Well, yes, it's good in respect to American cheese, but the stat for American cheese is a whole caps out real low.

1097
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:02,059
Scott: No, it's- The best American cheese is worse- It's just a different variety of cheese.

1098
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,259
Rym: Yeah, and it's flavorless.

1099
00:56:04,782 --> 00:56:09,460
Scott: No, you haven't had a flavorful high quality American cheese that has a flavor.

1100
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:18,180
Rym: If I blindfolded you, I don't think you could tell the difference between good American cheese and really, really shitty like Colby Jack.

1101
00:56:19,381 --> 00:56:25,920
Scott: Go get some really shitty Colby Jack and get like, I guess I already said Land O'Lakes American has flavor, so get that.

1102
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:29,140
Scott: I can tell it apart with my eyes closed.

1103
00:56:29,782 --> 00:56:31,320
Scott: Get yellow or white, it's just food coloring.

1104
00:56:31,542 --> 00:56:32,060
Scott: It's not any different.

1105
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:35,515
Rym: All right, now we've definitely killed enough time, so- Okay.

1106
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,420
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
