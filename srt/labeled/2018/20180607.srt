00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,519
Rym: It's Thursday, June 7th 2018.

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,342
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,422 --> 00:00:15,010
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,551 --> 00:00:16,955
Rym: Indian food cuz.

5
00:00:16,995 --> 00:00:18,599
Rym: we really are out of Thursday.

6
00:00:18,639 --> 00:00:19,321
Rym: show ideas.

7
00:00:19,962 --> 00:00:21,867
Scott: This is my microphone working complaining.

8
00:00:21,887 --> 00:00:22,870
Rym: Your microphone is working.

9
00:00:24,452 --> 00:00:25,488
Rym: Let's do this.

10
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:29,950
Scott: So at work, I got this new job in a new neighborhood.

11
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,399
Scott: It's actually old neighborhood is the same neighborhood.

12
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,909
Scott: my previous job, you know, it's crazy ten years ago was in.

13
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,475
Rym: I'm in the exact same boat.

14
00:00:36,576 --> 00:00:45,043
Rym: I recently got a new job and I'm in the neighborhood where my job from ten years ago was anyway, so The problem is is food situation down there.

15
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:49,742
Scott: There's plenty of places to get food But a lot of them are very expensive.

16
00:00:49,762 --> 00:00:50,646
Scott: There are some cheap ones.

17
00:00:50,807 --> 00:00:51,590
Rym: Oh cry me a river.

18
00:00:51,731 --> 00:00:56,770
Rym: I'm in Midtown next to Grand Central All right, but it's either pret or a twelve dollar sand.

19
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:03,506
Scott: But the thing is even at least in Midtown I could go to the everything deli and there were some everything delis there that were good.

20
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:06,804
Scott: down in Soho There's like one everything deli and it's gross.

21
00:01:07,307 --> 00:01:10,770
Scott: Yeah And basically all the good food is fancy.

22
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,799
Scott: There's a. there's some food that is cheap and not fancy.

23
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:17,070
Scott: go to Chinatown or I can go to like the bond me place.

24
00:01:17,793 --> 00:01:18,657
Scott: That's about it though.

25
00:01:18,697 --> 00:01:22,497
Scott: So it's like if you eat the cheap food, you're gonna be eating the same food every day Which is no good.

26
00:01:22,698 --> 00:01:24,310
Scott: Yeah, so I try to find a different solution.

27
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:36,338
Scott: My previous solution used to be to bring bread peanut butter and jelly to work and make sandwiches and you know Keep it cheap, but I really don't want to eat peanut butter and jelly every day Anymore like I used to.

28
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,062
Rym: well, I made it.

29
00:01:37,143 --> 00:01:40,330
Rym: I made a conscious decision In fact, we thought about doing this show on lunch.

30
00:01:40,631 --> 00:01:45,950
Rym: We looked up and sure enough we did a show on lunch and I said something in that show and I'll say it again now Is this relevant?

31
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:58,834
Rym: I made the decision a long time ago even when I didn't have a lot of money that I was willing to pay What it cost to have a good hot lunch every goddamn day that I do not have to make myself And I consider that a cost of.

32
00:01:59,055 --> 00:02:01,241
Scott: it's weird how near Times Square there were.

33
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:05,484
Scott: I could save like it was multiple dollars per day Cheaper than where I am now.

34
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:06,010
Scott: But anyway.

35
00:02:07,652 --> 00:02:12,779
Scott: So for once, you know, I made a some dinner I cook some dinner and I actually brought the leftovers to work.

36
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:15,890
Scott: and I was like I finally brought the leftovers to work.

37
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,970
Scott: Go me I did it and I'm gonna pay zero dollars effectively for lunch today.

38
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,590
Rym: My co-workers are all on a kick with that lately.

39
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,001
Rym: Everyone's like who did you bring today?

40
00:02:23,022 --> 00:02:23,667
Rym: or did you bail?

41
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,255
Scott: That's what everyone and my you know, a lot of people in my work They bring.

42
00:02:27,275 --> 00:02:32,146
Scott: the fridge is like totally full But it's like I have to actually cook and remember to do it that one person brings.

43
00:02:32,226 --> 00:02:34,377
Rym: everyone else gets impressed Like whoa, you actually did it.

44
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:35,644
Rym: No, I should do it too.

45
00:02:35,724 --> 00:02:36,629
Scott: Almost everyone does it.

46
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:43,250
Scott: But the thing is I go out and like sit down at a restaurant the day that I brought in my leftovers to eat.

47
00:02:43,952 --> 00:02:47,942
Scott: The microwave at work is broken and it won't be fixed till like tomorrow.

48
00:02:48,263 --> 00:02:49,426
Scott: Ah, so I brought sucks.

49
00:02:49,607 --> 00:02:54,675
Scott: So I brought the leftovers home During your fridge.

50
00:02:54,735 --> 00:02:58,310
Scott: now, I'll either microwave them and leave or go home then microwave.

51
00:02:58,552 --> 00:03:07,810
Rym: See when I would bring lunches Like the few times I would do that I would never rely on a microwave at the remote destination partly because I don't like reheating things with microwaves.

52
00:03:08,252 --> 00:03:09,115
Rym: They tend not to.

53
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:09,778
Scott: how can you?

54
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:12,530
Scott: but there are certain things that I mean, it's like yes, it's true.

55
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:18,315
Scott: If I'm gonna reheat say, I don't know Like a Sandwich.

56
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:20,569
Rym: I worked in a place once that had a fucking stove.

57
00:03:21,072 --> 00:03:22,258
Scott: I mean we have a toaster oven.

58
00:03:22,278 --> 00:03:24,690
Scott: I can reheat things in but it's like I'm gonna reheat a sandwich.

59
00:03:24,811 --> 00:03:25,801
Scott: I'll do that in a toaster oven.

60
00:03:25,821 --> 00:03:31,608
Scott: so it's nice and crispy Right, but if I'm gonna reheat a bowl of pastas, I'm not gonna do that in a toaster oven.

61
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,090
Scott: that doesn't work.

62
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:32,735
Scott: It dries out.

63
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:33,844
Scott: You got to do it in the microwave.

64
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:34,550
Scott: That's a microwave.

65
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:36,898
Scott: Anything mushy is a microwave reheating.

66
00:03:36,938 --> 00:03:40,430
Rym: see I would only ever bring lunches that were things that didn't require reheating.

67
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:42,961
Scott: I cooked a pasta for dinner and now it's still.

68
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:45,030
Scott: it's not gonna magically change into a sandwich.

69
00:03:45,211 --> 00:03:46,850
Scott: It needs to be reheated in the microwave.

70
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,264
Rym: Yeah, I don't know I just I. it was partly when I was working at a hospital.

71
00:03:53,284 --> 00:03:54,067
Rym: I was in Yonkers.

72
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:54,789
Rym: there were.

73
00:03:55,773 --> 00:04:01,350
Rym: Well when I say were there was one place you could get lunch without driving somewhere.

74
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:06,750
Rym: Oh boy, so I would walk 20 minutes to that one place and you know what it was.

75
00:04:07,191 --> 00:04:13,450
Rym: It was a sit-down Italian restaurant nice, but because it was in Yonkers, it was actually really cheap.

76
00:04:13,773 --> 00:04:22,070
Rym: so every day for lunch I'd have like spaghetti or like a lasagna like real Italian food for like six bucks.

77
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,480
Scott: I'm used to when in Midtown the lunches were usually like $8.

78
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:33,684
Scott: He'd end up spending $10 maybe for lunch down in Soho It's like $15 and $3 a day adds up real fast.

79
00:04:33,704 --> 00:04:38,141
Rym: If I just go to the Pret in Midtown It's like nine bucks for a mediocre sandwich.

80
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:39,025
Scott: That's not enough food.

81
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,934
Scott: The other thing is like a lot of times It's not enough foods.

82
00:04:41,075 --> 00:04:43,490
Scott: No, and I'm still hungry and it's just like that's not good.

83
00:04:43,772 --> 00:04:52,870
Rym: The only thing that saves me is that there's an unlimited Pantry in my job so I can basically get free breakfast and constant snacks like bananas and stuff.

84
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:53,854
Scott: It's like I've been.

85
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:55,581
Scott: you know where I was in Midtown.

86
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:57,690
Scott: I can go to the food emporium, which is an overpriced supermarket.

87
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,684
Scott: Yeah, but you think oh, that's an overpriced supermarket.

88
00:05:00,744 --> 00:05:01,227
Scott: Guess what?

89
00:05:01,307 --> 00:05:05,813
Scott: down in Soho It's a Dean and DeLuca, which is a one-percenter Supermarket.

90
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:09,350
Rym: where I do an apple is $10 a little bit even though the commute was longer.

91
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,141
Rym: I miss working downtown because I could get it like go-go curry.

92
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:15,716
Rym: That is plenty of food for like $6.

93
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:15,979
Rym: that's what.

94
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:20,130
Scott: that's the kind of places I'm need for my lunch if I had enough of those places that I didn't have to eat.

95
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,425
Rym: I mean, I know the problem was I went to go-go curry like twice a week.

96
00:05:23,626 --> 00:05:24,269
Rym: That's bad news.

97
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:26,559
Rym: That's bad news for a lot of reasons.

98
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,287
Scott: That sounds like good news to me.

99
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:28,790
Scott: It's good.

100
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:30,638
Rym: Well, you know what it is like all things.

101
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,170
Rym: It's good news until it's bad news.

102
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,639
Scott: It sounds like it's just good news.

103
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:40,710
Rym: in the immortal words of Dave Riley The best thing in life is pooping and the worst thing in life is too much pooping.

104
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:43,018
Scott: I think to go curries a week will not be too much.

105
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,848
Rym: Yeah, the problem is I wanted to go that third time.

106
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:49,189
Scott: No I'd be holding back at the second time.

107
00:05:51,193 --> 00:05:52,609
Rym: So there's a bunch of news going on.

108
00:05:52,710 --> 00:06:03,130
Rym: But I do have an opening bit too because you might have noticed We didn't live stream some of our shows recently and then we started up again and the one Live stream we did earlier in this week Scott was really quiet.

109
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:16,504
Rym: so the deal is we've had a lot of Hardware issues in the GeekNights pipeline lately because the mixer we use is Hella decommissioned like it is to even down mission.

110
00:06:16,524 --> 00:06:17,830
Scott: Do you know what decommission means?

111
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,639
Scott: So do you mean deprecated or discontinued?

112
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,266
Rym: So it's not just so.

113
00:06:22,306 --> 00:06:23,310
Rym: it's not just discontinued.

114
00:06:23,892 --> 00:06:26,440
Rym: It is discontinued to the point that I can't even get support.

115
00:06:26,882 --> 00:06:27,022
Rym: Mm-hmm.

116
00:06:27,243 --> 00:06:29,149
Rym: It's actually hard to download the drivers.

117
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:30,434
Rym: There's like.

118
00:06:30,795 --> 00:06:32,841
Scott: I even try to download them and back them up on your neck.

119
00:06:32,922 --> 00:06:33,744
Rym: I did download.

120
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:35,470
Rym: I have them backed up on the NAS.

121
00:06:37,072 --> 00:06:43,327
Rym: It is to the point where hardware failures like I even contacted third-party people like yo, well, that might be a problem.

122
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:46,865
Scott: if you know Windows 11 comes out and the drivers don't work.

123
00:06:46,885 --> 00:06:52,805
Rym: Yeah I'm already at the point where I have an extra firewire card that I know works with this thing.

124
00:06:52,825 --> 00:06:55,990
Rym: in case the card I use doesn't work anymore.

125
00:06:56,751 --> 00:07:00,426
Scott: So you might need to keep like a computer around but the old software on it.

126
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,612
Scott: in case you know I'm.

127
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,186
Rym: uh, well the software is audition.

128
00:07:03,226 --> 00:07:12,130
Scott: luckily I'm saying like, you know, if you say one day Windows 11 now You might want to like grab a laptop that has a fire, you know, an old laptop with a firewire.

129
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:14,098
Scott: My hope runs Windows 10.

130
00:07:14,098 --> 00:07:33,394
Rym: My only hope is that the audio hardware industry Joins the modern world before this mixer dies because I do not want to buy another mixer because I love the hell out of this thing and It's shocking how shitty most of the even professional Audio equipment out there is.

131
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:39,810
Rym: if you want a digital mixer and you're not willing to spend like eight to ten thousand dollars.

132
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:46,964
Scott: Yeah, I looked and I saw tons of new mixers that lots of fancy features that could be good For example, then you die integrate with apps.

133
00:07:47,004 --> 00:07:48,070
Scott: They have touch screens.

134
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,923
Scott: They don't have too many software instead of having hardware control.

135
00:07:51,943 --> 00:08:05,976
Rym: They say things like yeah 24 channels but no, it's 24x2 channels or sometimes it's 24 analog channels 2x2 digital right and it'll be like when you plug in the USB 3 cable There's only two channels.

136
00:08:06,157 --> 00:08:10,335
Scott: Ah, it's just a stereo sound card Whereas this a real digital mixer.

137
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:15,430
Scott: in audition will actually every single channel on the mixer will be a different line in audition.

138
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:15,712
Scott: That's the.

139
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:17,522
Scott: that's literally the only feature we need.

140
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:18,790
Scott: We don't need all these other features.

141
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:28,675
Scott: They've crammed in there like effects and shit because our podcasting Want is that there should be at least like four to eight channels in audition All separately up.

142
00:08:29,238 --> 00:08:29,580
Scott: That's it.

143
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,304
Scott: That's all we need.

144
00:08:30,586 --> 00:08:31,310
Rym: I use more than that.

145
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:41,190
Rym: so the other things we use cuz in the GeekNights pipeline is The thing is we don't do it cuz we haven't interviewed anyone and for fuck There are other ways we can interview people though without doing that.

146
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:42,543
Rym: Yeah but there are a pain in the ass.

147
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:50,852
Rym: and Also, I have this integrated into the room like I can throw a channel into the mod like the speakers in the room or the Headphones.

148
00:08:50,952 --> 00:08:55,750
Rym: I use this mixer as my sound card and it's it's kind of great actually to have those capabilities.

149
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,470
Rym: Like I can record audio from the computer.

150
00:08:58,811 --> 00:09:05,948
Rym: I could actually pipe our voices into audition and have a real-time pipeline to have the effects come back into the mixer for the live stream.

151
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:09,880
Rym: But I'm actually using the old compressor for that because that's just easier.

152
00:09:10,562 --> 00:09:17,478
Rym: But again, like this mixer has inserts and all that stuff so the a big part of why These mixers all suck.

153
00:09:17,618 --> 00:09:20,190
Rym: Is that all the companies that make USB mixers?

154
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:25,115
Rym: Still just use USB to Mmm, like webcams to like.

155
00:09:25,135 --> 00:09:27,903
Rym: there really aren't USB 3 webcams or USB 3 mixers.

156
00:09:28,324 --> 00:09:29,327
Scott: Why don't we just make one?

157
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:33,136
Rym: cuz I Don't know what the market is for these.

158
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:33,919
Rym: Mmm.

159
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,765
Scott: I actually asked her you'll find out.

160
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:37,130
Rym: so I actually asked her out.

161
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,478
Rym: I dug around and make a Kickstarter.

162
00:09:38,518 --> 00:09:40,369
Scott: if there's a market it'll you'll get kick-started.

163
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:45,326
Scott: if Think oh, we'll make a Kickstarter, but then we'll be one of those people who don't deliver.

164
00:09:45,346 --> 00:09:46,010
Scott: cuz what do we know?

165
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:53,470
Scott: We'll just set the goal so ridiculously high that if we get that amount of money We're guaranteed to succeed exactly if we get like five million dollars.

166
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:53,753
Scott: It's like.

167
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:54,602
Scott: I think we can do it.

168
00:09:54,703 --> 00:09:57,868
Scott: we get you know We can deliver to the people and if we don't then we don't do it.

169
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:03,845
Rym: But let's get my friends who work in like professional podcasts.

170
00:10:04,126 --> 00:10:09,710
Rym: I ask people who are like in studios I even ask people at my job because where I work we have professional recording studios.

171
00:10:09,971 --> 00:10:12,183
Rym: I went to the recording studio and fucking looked at what they got.

172
00:10:12,203 --> 00:10:13,650
Rym: It's the same shit.

173
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,172
Rym: I got.

174
00:10:14,494 --> 00:10:19,915
Rym: everyone's just running the legacy hardware because it's still the best hardware But it's no.

175
00:10:20,216 --> 00:10:22,425
Scott: all these companies that produce this equipment have to be.

176
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:22,987
Scott: are they like?

177
00:10:23,007 --> 00:10:26,670
Scott: is People buying the new equipment because otherwise they'd be out of business?

178
00:10:26,931 --> 00:10:28,637
Scott: It seems like are they not selling?

179
00:10:28,818 --> 00:10:29,962
Scott: or maybe they are selling?

180
00:10:30,002 --> 00:10:32,030
Scott: and if those people who are buying what are they doing?

181
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,521
Rym: Yeah, and it seems like are they all musicians?

182
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,230
Scott: is they doing musicians only and they don't?

183
00:10:37,674 --> 00:10:38,637
Scott: And talk people?

184
00:10:38,677 --> 00:10:46,514
Rym: a lot of the people who are at the level of sophistication that GeekNights says for audio They primarily do live Mixing.

185
00:10:46,936 --> 00:10:50,130
Rym: where you need analog you need all that crazy analog shit.

186
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:58,758
Rym: So the room like the house has good audio like that, but they're not really trying to record The level of quality that we're recording.

187
00:10:58,778 --> 00:11:00,143
Rym: They're recording the final mix.

188
00:11:00,384 --> 00:11:02,210
Rym: They're recording like some track inserts.

189
00:11:02,512 --> 00:11:05,449
Rym: It's a very different production pipeline from talk radio.

190
00:11:06,171 --> 00:11:07,917
Rym: Talk radio is still using this shit.

191
00:11:08,237 --> 00:11:10,324
Rym: Talk radio is still literally using morances.

192
00:11:10,725 --> 00:11:14,937
Rym: I went to a professional recording studio Yesterday and what did I see?

193
00:11:15,137 --> 00:11:17,083
Rym: sitting on the desk through the window?

194
00:11:17,103 --> 00:11:20,511
Rym: a fucking Marantz PMD 660?

195
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:21,034
Rym: The same thing.

196
00:11:21,074 --> 00:11:25,456
Rym: I got sitting right here that hasn't been manufactured since like 2003.

197
00:11:25,456 --> 00:11:31,890
Rym: So yeah I Just want this mixer to last and I'm gonna see if I can physically fix some of the ports that have died.

198
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,804
Scott: You're gonna break it will try and fix it and that's gonna be the end.

199
00:11:35,045 --> 00:11:35,950
Rym: Yeah, I'll cry.

200
00:11:37,934 --> 00:11:43,393
Rym: I did open it up though to take a look and I actually looked as you saw fire in there The magic smoke came out.

201
00:11:43,914 --> 00:11:46,461
Rym: I could solder in there that complicated.

202
00:11:46,481 --> 00:11:46,922
Rym: Uh-huh.

203
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:49,789
Rym: It's a pretty well documented actually all this stuff.

204
00:11:51,532 --> 00:12:15,563
Rym: So in other news you might have noticed I think I mentioned this on GeekNights a while ago But there is a weird story that kept popping up in the real news Like I saw this on FARC and then like months later it started appearing in crackpot news but eventually it started appearing on like CNN and like Washington Post and like real news.

205
00:12:15,984 --> 00:12:19,042
Rym: and it was this story about like Sonic attacks.

206
00:12:19,062 --> 00:12:19,890
Scott: didn't we talk about this?

207
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,558
Scott: In Cuba we did so.

208
00:12:22,778 --> 00:12:26,430
Scott: I think the final thing I saw about that was that it wasn't actually intentional.

209
00:12:26,811 --> 00:12:32,586
Scott: It was some sort of accident where they just had a bunch of different equipment all set up near each other.

210
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:41,510
Scott: that happened to combine in a bad way Unluckily and it's due to incompetence and not due to some genius, you know intentional thing.

211
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:44,810
Rym: So I read that same story and that was a narrative.

212
00:12:44,971 --> 00:12:47,484
Scott: I mean the thing is I don't have none of know.

213
00:12:47,504 --> 00:12:48,690
Scott: all this was just articles.

214
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:48,891
Scott: There's.

215
00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:51,690
Scott: no I haven't seen any actual evidence for any of this.

216
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:58,115
Scott: I haven't even seen somebody like set up like in a test lab like proof that this happen Right.

217
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,270
Rym: So basically that was a plausible explanation.

218
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:01,873
Rym: Mm-hmm.

219
00:13:02,678 --> 00:13:04,588
Rym: It's happening in other US embassies.

220
00:13:04,648 --> 00:13:07,839
Rym: now Mm-hmm It's happening in China and they did.

221
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:14,109
Rym: we just have the US just evacuated a bunch of diplomats For basically the exact same symptoms the exact same problem.

222
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:18,050
Scott: My guess, you know something more realistic?

223
00:13:18,391 --> 00:13:20,799
Rym: It appears that mass hysteria is ruled out.

224
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,790
Rym: the doctors have found actual specific brain damage.

225
00:13:24,832 --> 00:13:25,093
Scott: No, no.

226
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:31,375
Scott: No, I'm saying is that I don't think it's caused by a You know say audio.

227
00:13:31,415 --> 00:13:33,843
Scott: I don't think just because audio is just vibrating air.

228
00:13:34,003 --> 00:13:35,990
Scott: I don't think vibrating air can cause brain damage.

229
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,696
Scott: Yes, it can.

230
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:37,342
Rym: Uh-huh.

231
00:13:37,443 --> 00:13:38,189
Rym: Yes, it can.

232
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:43,989
Scott: I think that it is more likely caused by maybe a virus or a parasite or something like that.

233
00:13:44,551 --> 00:13:52,713
Scott: That virus or parasite fucks with your ear so you think you're hearing sounds you ain't hearing or so It's not just that people are hearing sounds There's a you'd like.

234
00:13:52,754 --> 00:14:06,457
Rym: this article actually goes into a little more explanation and a little more detail about it but the ultrasonic attack thing is still not actually ruled out and still seems to be feasible because the deal is Sound waves.

235
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:08,670
Scott: I think it's something else that causes an audio hallucination.

236
00:14:09,812 --> 00:14:11,381
Rym: It's not just audio hallucination.

237
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:13,010
Rym: It's physical damage to the brain.

238
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:17,523
Scott: Yeah, the parasite or virus causes damage to your brain and gives you an auditory hallucination.

239
00:14:17,884 --> 00:14:19,770
Scott: Yeah, but this is my reasonable guess.

240
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:25,010
Rym: Yeah, so the crazy thing is that this is now happening in multiple places.

241
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:25,651
Scott: Yeah You know what?

242
00:14:25,671 --> 00:14:32,540
Scott: This tells me let's not travel to any countries that really hate the u.s So much in case we have to end up going to the end.

243
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,665
Rym: I saw a great tweet.

244
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:53,019
Rym: That was like 99% of everyone outside of North America who has a Canadian flag displayed is an American And I can feel that I mean we Emily and I were in Australia right before the election and It was rough even then and now it's getting rougher.

245
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:53,862
Rym: Let's try.

246
00:14:53,902 --> 00:14:54,825
Scott: they got their own problems.

247
00:14:54,965 --> 00:14:55,146
Scott: Yeah.

248
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,570
Rym: Oh, there's a crazy story.

249
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:04,517
Rym: I didn't make my news because I don't fucking understand it or believe it about this town that has 12 people in it in Like the like the fucking nowhere in Australia.

250
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:04,898
Scott: Okay.

251
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:05,599
Scott: Was it just the word?

252
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,602
Scott: Oh, I written 12 times.

253
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:09,329
Rym: So somebody disappeared from the town.

254
00:15:10,032 --> 00:15:15,190
Rym: The government's pretty sure the town fucking murdered this dude and all agreed to keep it quiet and they can't prove it.

255
00:15:15,551 --> 00:15:18,163
Scott: I mean, that's the only reasonable explanation.

256
00:15:18,223 --> 00:15:19,650
Scott: So therefore there's no reasonable day.

257
00:15:20,031 --> 00:15:21,836
Scott: There's no other reason.

258
00:15:22,116 --> 00:15:23,099
Rym: there's also a hint.

259
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:27,290
Scott: if there is no other reasonable explanation then it's beyond reasonable doubt.

260
00:15:27,431 --> 00:15:30,610
Scott: There's all the evidence you need and there's no other reasonable explanation.

261
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:35,325
Rym: That is not the standard of American jurisprudence or law at least.

262
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,388
Scott: Oh It's Australia.

263
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:39,779
Scott: The law is just like.

264
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,768
Rym: ah, but this story was so crazy I didn't have time to read it enough to even talk about it.

265
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:50,390
Rym: But I think the real thing we need to do is avoid US consulates and embassies in countries that hate us.

266
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,192
Scott: It sounds good.

267
00:15:51,212 --> 00:15:53,319
Scott: I'll just go to some other countries ever see instead.

268
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,970
Rym: Yeah, but this story just it's You know, okay, you'll see like a crazy story.

269
00:15:59,311 --> 00:16:04,970
Rym: And if you're a reasonable person you think that is probably not true and I will ignore it unless I keep seeing it.

270
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:09,387
Rym: This one keeps happening and I'm getting increasingly fascinated by it.

271
00:16:09,608 --> 00:16:09,728
Scott: Mm-hmm.

272
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:17,709
Scott: so maybe they're hoping that some of that maybe it is like a virus or parasite and they're hoping that the Diplomat or someone will eventually meet the president and pass it on.

273
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:18,452
Rym: I mean like.

274
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:24,933
Rym: this is in the realm of something like something like that about the Ukrainian guy who faked his own death to catch The Russian assassin.

275
00:16:25,114 --> 00:16:25,957
Scott: that guy's badass.

276
00:16:26,558 --> 00:16:27,842
Scott: They're gonna make a movie about that.

277
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:38,835
Scott: Probably at least it'll be at least made for TV movie If not Hollywood movie and it will definitely be out within like a year because that story already is Literally twice as crazy as you realize.

278
00:16:39,136 --> 00:16:40,900
Rym: like the story escalated.

279
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,863
Scott: It is 100% true.

280
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,534
Rym: It escalated way beyond what we already know Mm-hmm.

281
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,969
Rym: But again, I didn't read it deep in depth enough to talk about it.

282
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,801
Rym: I read enough in some other news.

283
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:56,747
Rym: if you ever been in New York There's a. we have this huge bridge between New York and the rest of the country.

284
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:57,570
Rym: It's called, New Jersey.

285
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:04,670
Rym: I don't know if anyone's ever been to it But to get to that land bridge you have to go over another bridge called the Verrazano narrows bridge.

286
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:11,550
Scott: You can use the George Washington bridge you can but and also technically the Verrazano bridge connects you to Staten Island and not to New Jersey.

287
00:17:11,651 --> 00:17:13,404
Scott: but Staten Island is New Jersey.

288
00:17:13,626 --> 00:17:21,470
Rym: well, so The Verrazano narrow bridge and Staten Island combined is a bridge to New Jersey, which itself is a land.

289
00:17:21,932 --> 00:17:32,534
Scott: After you go over the Verrazano and then over this elevated highway that allows you to not touch Staten Island like it's hot lava you go over either the The what's it called?

290
00:17:32,554 --> 00:17:33,757
Scott: There's the gothals bridge.

291
00:17:33,797 --> 00:17:37,186
Scott: Yeah, and then there's the what the cross something.

292
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:38,269
Scott: I don't cross island.

293
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,414
Scott: I forget what it's called.

294
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:40,781
Rym: I usually use the gothals.

295
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:41,826
Scott: Yeah, it's the other one.

296
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,076
Scott: anyway I forget what it's called.

297
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:47,370
Rym: the Verrazano narrows bridge is real fucking long.

298
00:17:47,611 --> 00:17:50,990
Scott: I biked over it because if you do normally you cannot bike over it.

299
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,015
Scott: You can only car over.

300
00:17:52,075 --> 00:17:52,899
Scott: it has two levels.

301
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,492
Scott: Yeah, but if you do the five borough bike tour It's like.

302
00:17:55,533 --> 00:18:01,942
Scott: the only part of it worth doing is that you can bike on roads that are otherwise Unbikable like the FDR and the BQE.

303
00:18:02,023 --> 00:18:02,364
Scott: and it's when?

304
00:18:02,384 --> 00:18:03,630
Scott: then the Verrazano.

305
00:18:04,075 --> 00:18:05,330
Scott: So I did it once and that's enough.

306
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:09,710
Scott: But you go over there Verrazano and let me tell you I bike over like the Queensborough bridge every day.

307
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,087
Scott: It's like not even I don't even notice that it's a hill.

308
00:18:16,851 --> 00:18:20,410
Scott: It's not that it's like you look at the grade and it doesn't seem like it's so bad.

309
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,494
Scott: It's like fuck that bridge.

310
00:18:21,554 --> 00:18:22,718
Rym: Yep, two miles later.

311
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:25,609
Scott: It is long and it's a big hump.

312
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,073
Scott: They keep.

313
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:30,170
Scott: people keep like campaigning like we want to put a bike path on it.

314
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,557
Scott: I'm like, you're never gonna use that.

315
00:18:32,261 --> 00:18:36,444
Scott: go up and you're just gonna turn right back around Especially when you realize Staten Island's.

316
00:18:36,484 --> 00:18:40,870
Scott: on the other side There's a kind of person who will use that and you're not gonna be able to bike if you're trying.

317
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,640
Scott: You know you once you get to the other side on.

318
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,776
Scott: if there was a bike path now You can't go on the highway.

319
00:18:45,836 --> 00:18:49,090
Scott: instead you're gonna go down and actually touch that lava.

320
00:18:49,373 --> 00:18:51,693
Rym: Yeah, you do not want to touch Staten Island You're gonna.

321
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:58,197
Scott: you're gonna bike as fast as you can back to the ferry cuz you can go back over the bridge Rise back to civilization.

322
00:18:58,317 --> 00:19:04,369
Rym: the Verrazano narrows bridge is named after Giovanni de Verrazano some Italian guy.

323
00:19:04,671 --> 00:19:10,030
Rym: So there's a bunch of crazy shit going on with this bridge and Giovanni de Verrazano.

324
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:28,050
Rym: so in the 50s the Italian American community was really I guess concerned about Its image in America and it made a Concerted funded effort to get things named after Italians all around the country funded with the money from the family.

325
00:19:28,371 --> 00:19:37,437
Rym: And one of those things was they wanted this bridge which was just going to be called the narrows bridge to be named after Giovanni de Verrazano, why is it called the narrows?

326
00:19:37,497 --> 00:19:39,462
Scott: It crosses the least narrow part.

327
00:19:39,563 --> 00:19:40,345
Rym: That's actually them.

328
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:42,169
Rym: It's the narrowest part.

329
00:19:44,152 --> 00:19:45,740
Rym: If you wanted to put a bridge down there.

330
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,890
Rym: anywhere else is way less narrow.

331
00:19:48,614 --> 00:19:51,089
Rym: I guess so and they needed a bridge there.

332
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:53,275
Scott: So who do need a bridge?

333
00:19:53,636 --> 00:19:55,400
Rym: New York and Robert Moses is like.

334
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:59,250
Rym: the response to this was who the fuck is Giovanni de Verrazano?

335
00:19:59,674 --> 00:20:06,439
Rym: because apparently Giovanni de Verrazano is Less objectionable than a lot of the explorers like.

336
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:16,930
Rym: it doesn't seem like there's a lot of genocide in his history like certain other people But he was really unlucky and that he discovered for white people a bunch of important things.

337
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,578
Rym: He's one of the more important explorers.

338
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:19,905
Scott: I never heard about him in school.

339
00:20:19,945 --> 00:20:23,742
Scott: Yeah, no one heard about him I heard about like fucking Pons de Leon and shit instead.

340
00:20:24,103 --> 00:20:25,730
Scott: We all learned about Spanish explorers.

341
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:32,730
Rym: He happened to discover all these things in the 1500s while Magellan and the Conquistadors were happening.

342
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:40,257
Rym: So everyone paid attention to all that nonsense and ignored the fact that he basically Discovered like New York Harbor for white people.

343
00:20:40,457 --> 00:20:42,162
Scott: didn't Henry Hudson discover.

344
00:20:42,683 --> 00:20:44,828
Rym: No, that was way later and you're one of those people.

345
00:20:45,089 --> 00:21:03,795
Rym: Hey Verrazano's reputation quote I'm recording Wikipedia was particularly obscure in New York City where the 1609 voyage of Henley Henry Hudson was regarded as the de facto start of European exploration of New York, even though Giovanni de Verrazano mapped all that shit in like 1519.

346
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:04,660
Scott: fuck you school.

347
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,230
Scott: Yeah, tell me wrong.

348
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,017
Rym: So nobody remembered this dude at all.

349
00:21:08,318 --> 00:21:10,708
Rym: and New York City was like why the fuck would we name it after him?

350
00:21:10,748 --> 00:21:12,865
Rym: and the Italian Community was like because here's a pile of money.

351
00:21:12,925 --> 00:21:15,874
Rym: Shut up We spelled it wrong.

352
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:20,470
Rym: They fucked up and spelled it with one Z and when they realized it it was too late to change it.

353
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:24,965
Scott: So that's why it has two and it's supposed to have three supposed to have two Z's it only has one.

354
00:21:24,985 --> 00:21:26,812
Scott: I Thought I had two Z's.

355
00:21:26,893 --> 00:21:29,081
Rym: Yeah, apparently a lot of people think it only has it.

356
00:21:29,362 --> 00:21:32,082
Scott: apparently this is why this is the pretty sure It has two Z's.

357
00:21:32,953 --> 00:21:35,629
Scott: This is why I've never seen a sign with only one Z on it.

358
00:21:36,112 --> 00:21:39,372
Rym: So this is the news June 7th 2018.

359
00:21:39,372 --> 00:21:44,230
Rym: There is a bill in the New York State Senate Assembly that just passed unanimously.

360
00:21:44,391 --> 00:21:48,827
Rym: Wait, the Senate Assembly the New York State Senate passed the bill.

361
00:21:48,927 --> 00:21:50,613
Rym: Okay Unanimously.

362
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:55,167
Rym: that would correct the spelling of the name and even Simba Felder voted.

363
00:21:55,207 --> 00:21:55,488
Scott: Yes.

364
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:57,270
Rym: Yeah unanimous.

365
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:01,042
Rym: To add a Z to the name of the Paris.

366
00:22:01,203 --> 00:22:02,650
Scott: I thought it had two Z's already.

367
00:22:03,411 --> 00:22:10,053
Rym: Yeah, not only did it not but it's been spelled wrong forever and For almost a hundred years.

368
00:22:10,093 --> 00:22:17,087
Rym: the statue at the base of the fucking bridge has its that was made at the same time as the Bridge was spelled correctly.

369
00:22:18,131 --> 00:22:20,199
Rym: Two Z's it's spelled correctly.

370
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:22,810
Scott: I feel like all the green highway signs have two Z's on them.

371
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:25,138
Scott: Am I remembering wrong?

372
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:26,102
Scott: because I know how to spell.

373
00:22:26,202 --> 00:22:31,403
Scott: I think my brain if I brain just Transforms a misspelled word into a correctly spelled world.

374
00:22:31,443 --> 00:22:36,690
Scott: when I look at it, I think Now the Mandela I can't even go over and look cuz I have a car.

375
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:42,770
Rym: Yeah So the bill was now sent to the assembly where it must pass and then Cuomo will have to sign it.

376
00:22:42,951 --> 00:22:44,850
Scott: Apparently the assembly will vote.

377
00:22:46,252 --> 00:22:50,150
Rym: Apparently they tried to do this earlier this year and the assembly didn't fucking vote.

378
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:55,030
Scott: Yes, the assembly is usually like the one who votes yes all the time and everything it's held up in the Senate.

379
00:22:55,172 --> 00:23:02,636
Scott: I cannot for the life assembly actually has voted for things like universal health care for all New Yorkers and the Senate won't vote on so I Cannot.

380
00:23:02,676 --> 00:23:04,670
Scott: why is this the opposite situation?

381
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:08,966
Rym: I do not know and no one will tell me and my research came up with.

382
00:23:08,986 --> 00:23:09,950
Scott: this makes no sense.

383
00:23:10,236 --> 00:23:18,530
Rym: Yeah This is the first time in New York State history where the New York State Senate did something right and the assembly is doing something.

384
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,050
Scott: Why do we need a law to fix spelling?

385
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,058
Scott: Like the DOT or the Port Authority?

386
00:23:23,078 --> 00:23:23,520
Scott: just fix it.

387
00:23:24,183 --> 00:23:24,645
Scott: They don't need it.

388
00:23:24,665 --> 00:23:25,590
Scott: Why do they need a law for that?

389
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,236
Rym: This is my more meta argument.

390
00:23:27,437 --> 00:23:30,610
Rym: Why the fuck does New York State have any fucking say in anything we do down here?

391
00:23:31,632 --> 00:23:32,967
Rym: That is not I'm actually mad about.

392
00:23:33,008 --> 00:23:36,384
Scott: I mean Why is you even need a law to make the name of a bridge?

393
00:23:36,444 --> 00:23:40,239
Scott: can't just like, you know The Port Authority or MTA whoever runs the British.

394
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,407
Scott: It's a Port Authority bridge the outer bridge crossing.

395
00:23:42,427 --> 00:23:43,170
Rym: That's the other one.

396
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:43,879
Scott: That's the other one.

397
00:23:43,981 --> 00:23:53,117
Rym: Thanks to Amanda But anyway things of the day.

398
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:54,942
Rym: so I found this video.

399
00:23:54,982 --> 00:24:02,907
Rym: it's like 10 minutes long where this dude is like I'm a make a bike where the entire frame is made out of spring.

400
00:24:02,947 --> 00:24:03,690
Scott: that will not work.

401
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:07,290
Scott: The bike will just go blorp and fall over and this video is an exploration.

402
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,154
Scott: You will have it.

403
00:24:08,174 --> 00:24:11,670
Scott: you will have a sculpture made that looks like a bike that is made of spring.

404
00:24:12,111 --> 00:24:14,598
Scott: That will be impossible to ride and it will not stand up.

405
00:24:14,658 --> 00:24:26,799
Rym: this video basically tracks a long journey of this person Trying to make a bike where the frame consists entirely of Springs and Failing in most of the endeavor.

406
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,050
Rym: Yes, and it's pretty funny and pretty interesting.

407
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:41,182
Rym: there's points where he's took like talking to people who manufacture Springs and like that Simpsons episode where Moleman is like I need the biggest seed bell you've got.

408
00:24:41,824 --> 00:24:43,690
Rym: no, that's too big.

409
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:52,981
Rym: He's not talking to people who make industrial Springs where he's like I need the stiffest spring you got and they're like Yeah, so we have a forty thousand dollar spring.

410
00:24:53,001 --> 00:25:05,130
Rym: That's a foot wide and he's like, okay, let's back it off And eventually he is able to replace the entire core of the frame of the bicycle with Springs.

411
00:25:05,511 --> 00:25:18,088
Rym: Yeah, not the whole frame just part that basically like the the top bar and the three bars Made one where the struts for the front tire were made of Springs and it did not.

412
00:25:18,168 --> 00:25:18,990
Rym: it was unbikable.

413
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,657
Scott: Yes, I think what someone should do though.

414
00:25:20,677 --> 00:25:21,801
Scott: This is a stupid idea.

415
00:25:21,841 --> 00:25:25,474
Scott: I think right it's all it's cute But I think would be not.

416
00:25:25,795 --> 00:25:40,350
Scott: that would be much cooler would be to make a bike entirely of shocks because then the springs Would do what they supposed to do and only spring in the one, you know axis and not wobble a bike sideways Right, I'll ride this thing when he finishes it.

417
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:40,873
Rym: It's just like.

418
00:25:41,115 --> 00:25:56,440
Scott: so you would have a. you right, you know You have a bike that is flexible forward and back and up and down in certain dimensions But you wouldn't have like the front part of the bike on warp to the left or the right making it unrideable And I think that that would actually be.

419
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:03,650
Scott: it probably still wouldn't work too Well, but it could actually be way comfortable like the bike would get longer or shorter as necessary, right?

420
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,561
Scott: You could depending on how the stiffness of the springs.

421
00:26:05,601 --> 00:26:17,061
Scott: I would you probably just use yeah I'll use adjustable like pneumatic shocks that way you could like, you know ease up certain ones Stiffen other ones so that you can get the bike like just right.

422
00:26:17,602 --> 00:26:19,850
Scott: it would probably the smoothest fucking ride.

423
00:26:20,394 --> 00:26:22,570
Scott: You probably wouldn't even feel the ground at that point.

424
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:26,030
Rym: I want a computer-controlled active ground cancellation bike.

425
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:32,412
Scott: The only reason I think that won't work is because you won't have enough fuel to carry a battery big enough to power the computer And such.

426
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:39,322
Scott: yeah, because you all the sensors you would need and plus, you know Plug it in really long extension cord.

427
00:26:39,523 --> 00:26:40,749
Scott: It would be a tank like bike.

428
00:26:41,735 --> 00:26:50,130
Rym: But this video is pretty funny because in the end He does make a functioning bike that has three spring leaves fun for some definitions of funk.

429
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,846
Rym: He's able to ride it like look it's going sure.

430
00:26:52,886 --> 00:27:00,128
Rym: He's pedaling It's going barely and he explores fully what this bike is capable of and it's not much.

431
00:27:00,308 --> 00:27:07,870
Scott: Nope I Think that just making a gif of that one, but up but up but up part I think illustrates the whole thing.

432
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:08,674
Scott: That's all you need to see.

433
00:27:08,855 --> 00:27:09,679
Scott: So you got a thing of the day.

434
00:27:09,699 --> 00:27:11,830
Scott: I got two things of the day.

435
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:12,192
Scott: Why not?

436
00:27:12,292 --> 00:27:15,048
Scott: one of them is just a gif I saw on Twitter of this dog.

437
00:27:15,088 --> 00:27:15,450
Scott: He float.

438
00:27:15,671 --> 00:27:17,298
Scott: Oh, he float and I want to.

439
00:27:17,358 --> 00:27:24,229
Scott: when I saw this gif it had such a profound impact on me I wanted to immediately leave work and float and I'm still considering just leaving here and floating.

440
00:27:25,172 --> 00:27:25,835
Scott: I can just go.

441
00:27:25,996 --> 00:27:26,660
Scott: they won't stop me.

442
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:31,210
Scott: if I just go to the airport and give them my credit card They will take me to a place where the water is warm.

443
00:27:31,592 --> 00:27:38,748
Scott: They will not object no one will stop me and then when I get there I can give my credit card to someone else and they will give me a place to sleep and float.

444
00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:41,030
Rym: Yep I think that will happen.

445
00:27:41,271 --> 00:27:47,670
Rym: You can keep floating till one day that person comes back and says sir Your credit card was declined and then I will go back to the airport.

446
00:27:50,771 --> 00:27:51,413
Scott: It could happen.

447
00:27:51,494 --> 00:27:52,016
Scott: I could do it.

448
00:27:52,116 --> 00:27:52,859
Scott: I'm thinking about it.

449
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,030
Rym: any water at Sandy Hook is 68 degrees too cold.

450
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:59,984
Rym: We are five degrees away from the bare minimum.

451
00:28:00,044 --> 00:28:01,770
Rym: I'm willing to put my body in that water.

452
00:28:02,091 --> 00:28:03,276
Rym: We are ten degrees away from.

453
00:28:03,376 --> 00:28:03,898
Rym: I will swim.

454
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,364
Scott: So I went to.

455
00:28:05,425 --> 00:28:06,670
Scott: here's my real thing of the day.

456
00:28:07,092 --> 00:28:07,775
Scott: It's not just a gif.

457
00:28:08,197 --> 00:28:14,748
Scott: so, you know, I pretty much have you know, you know Sometimes you get you know in a consumer materialist mood you start buying stuff, right?

458
00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:17,920
Rym: Yeah It's always that thing when I go to Amazon to buy like a serious thing.

459
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,985
Rym: I started looking at other serious purchases I've been holding a while ago.

460
00:28:23,025 --> 00:28:28,026
Scott: like a year or two ago I bought basically every kind of camera that I'd ever need in my life and I actually use them all.

461
00:28:28,066 --> 00:28:34,330
Scott: none of them became bowling Balls, I did a good job of buying exact amount of camera stuff that I use it all to the correct degree.

462
00:28:34,491 --> 00:28:37,543
Scott: I don't feel regret buying any of it and I didn't buy too much.

463
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:42,310
Scott: and as soon as I bought like enough I like lost all desire to buy more camera stuff.

464
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:47,090
Scott: Like I have no desire to buy another lens or camera because I already have every single situation.

465
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:58,006
Scott: I've got covered except for taking photos of space which I can't do like ignites once and if I had to I would just I would keep reading about microphone once we bought the countrymen and these beta mics.

466
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,256
Rym: I've got every microphone I'll need forever.

467
00:29:00,417 --> 00:29:02,129
Rym: Maybe I'll get one shotgun mic.

468
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:10,801
Scott: Yeah, I'm good for life anyway, but I then discovered the other day someone posted one of those gifts where it's like You know animates a little bit like to the left and right.

469
00:29:10,841 --> 00:29:12,710
Scott: it wiggles and it looks 3d, right?

470
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:15,145
Scott: It's one of those wiggling gifts that looks 3d, but it's not.

471
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:18,058
Scott: I like those Yeah, and usually there's different.

472
00:29:18,158 --> 00:29:18,961
Rym: one can just make them.

473
00:29:19,282 --> 00:29:21,470
Scott: I know a lot of people make them using different techniques.

474
00:29:22,933 --> 00:29:25,422
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean there's a lot of different techniques for making them.

475
00:29:25,803 --> 00:29:31,670
Scott: but apparently this person, you know Did it with a thing called a Nim's low and I was like what the fuck is a Nim's low?

476
00:29:32,931 --> 00:29:34,783
Scott: Nim's low is apparently this old camera.

477
00:29:34,803 --> 00:29:39,202
Scott: There's another cheaper version That's like a conica something or whatever, but the Nim's low is the good one.

478
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:44,950
Scott: where it's a 35 millimeter film camera It just has four fucking lenses on it with four shutters.

479
00:29:45,311 --> 00:29:59,770
Scott: Oh and it makes lenticular pen and you take a picture and when you take a picture It uses the amount of space on the film that would normally be used for two normal 35 millimeter shots And it basically cuts each frame in half and uses two frames.

480
00:30:00,111 --> 00:30:10,310
Scott: So if you have a roll of film that has 36 shots you would get 18 shots Right with this and each shot gives you four slightly different angles on the same thing.

481
00:30:10,691 --> 00:30:12,177
Scott: It's a completely automatic camera.

482
00:30:12,197 --> 00:30:14,806
Scott: It requires basically no focus autofocus.

483
00:30:14,907 --> 00:30:15,770
Scott: No, you don't got to do anything.

484
00:30:15,871 --> 00:30:19,190
Scott: I just push the button and if it's too dark you put a flash on it.

485
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,498
Scott: You don't got to adjust the f-stop.

486
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:21,766
Scott: You don't go to just the shutter speed.

487
00:30:21,806 --> 00:30:22,490
Scott: You're gonna nothing.

488
00:30:22,711 --> 00:30:23,695
Scott: You just aim it and shoot.

489
00:30:24,057 --> 00:30:28,952
Scott: it takes four shots slightly different angles of the same thing Simultaneously.

490
00:30:28,972 --> 00:30:30,317
Rym: just lens lens lens lens.

491
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:36,018
Scott: when you get home you scan your four shots in Photoshop You drag you put them on four layers.

492
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:45,218
Scott: You put them on top of each other and you tell Photoshop Hey make an animated gif go frame one, two, three, four, three two and then you're back to one again and then loop it.

493
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,370
Scott: and then you've got one of those things and I kind of wanted this.

494
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:55,850
Scott: and it's only like, you know for like a new one in box from the olden days that was never open is like 250 on eBay, you know.

495
00:30:55,991 --> 00:30:57,390
Rym: So it looks like before.

496
00:30:57,571 --> 00:30:58,654
Scott: He's probably too much.

497
00:30:58,694 --> 00:30:59,918
Rym: before the era of gifting.

498
00:30:59,978 --> 00:31:03,870
Rym: people would use this camera to make physical versions of that with the lenticular print.

499
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:06,330
Scott: Well people would use this in the olden days.

500
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:10,650
Scott: I think there was actually a way to make an actual 3d image somehow develop.

501
00:31:12,052 --> 00:31:15,785
Scott: You would look at it with you know, the the piece of plastic on it with the ridges.

502
00:31:15,926 --> 00:31:17,170
Rym: that's called lenticular printing.

503
00:31:17,331 --> 00:31:18,175
Rym: Oh, okay.

504
00:31:18,275 --> 00:31:18,939
Rym: I kept I didn't.

505
00:31:19,381 --> 00:31:20,647
Rym: I look here see that.

506
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:24,600
Scott: Yeah, so I don't know how to print one of those things with the ridges.

507
00:31:25,221 --> 00:31:28,130
Scott: But yeah, I kind of want this.

508
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:34,236
Rym: I haven't bought it yet But I kind of thing got pretty cheap toward the end of the 90s Like I recall there was a.

509
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:38,260
Scott: yeah now I haven't seen it hardly at all recently It's coming back feel like cuz.

510
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,650
Scott: everyone looks at things on a screen.

511
00:31:40,571 --> 00:31:43,163
Scott: There's no interest in having a still image on a piece of.

512
00:31:43,364 --> 00:31:51,010
Rym: so from what I gather Relatively recently like in the last few years there was a further advance where it's way fucking cheap to print this.

513
00:31:51,353 --> 00:31:57,910
Rym: so people are starting to make like Small low-key cheapo merch like keychains and things that has lenticular printing again.

514
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:03,092
Rym: Cuz now it's in the realm of like GeekNights could make a thing pretty cheaply and just do it All right.

515
00:32:03,112 --> 00:32:04,988
Scott: Well go buy me a nims little so I can.

516
00:32:06,231 --> 00:32:09,350
Rym: Yeah, I'll buy you a nims low after I buy a new camera for GeekNights.

517
00:32:11,051 --> 00:32:12,530
Rym: Now I'm gonna camcorder.

518
00:32:13,258 --> 00:32:14,254
Rym: Okay I don't want.

519
00:32:14,314 --> 00:32:15,681
Rym: I want an actual camcorder.

520
00:32:15,721 --> 00:32:24,034
Rym: the features of a camcorder Compared to the features of a micro four-thirds just like real camera I can do video.

521
00:32:24,174 --> 00:32:28,288
Scott: the only real feature that the camcorder offers is the larger shape of it.

522
00:32:28,368 --> 00:32:32,105
Rym: the physical Object is the integrated XLR and all that's just built in.

523
00:32:32,145 --> 00:32:34,539
Scott: I mean, yeah, you can get one of those Thingy attached on top.

524
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,778
Rym: Yeah, this is just built into the camera body Like a built-in ND filter.

525
00:32:38,818 --> 00:32:40,063
Scott: Otherwise, they're really.

526
00:32:40,184 --> 00:32:41,450
Scott: it's like built-in video lens.

527
00:32:41,911 --> 00:32:44,220
Rym: I don't need to get like a expensive lens to go with.

528
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,853
Scott: most of the good camcorders have lens mounts on the front these days Not built-in lenses.

529
00:32:48,074 --> 00:32:50,201
Rym: Mmm depends depends on which one I'm looking at.

530
00:32:50,241 --> 00:32:53,010
Rym: these Sony usually Panasonic usually their worst.

531
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:55,993
Rym: They're larger.

532
00:32:56,013 --> 00:32:59,183
Rym: there's a new Panasonic one that just came out with a one-inch sensor.

533
00:32:59,223 --> 00:33:00,187
Rym: that's pretty good.

534
00:33:00,387 --> 00:33:03,277
Rym: one inch is way small Yeah, but for what I need it's fine.

535
00:33:03,478 --> 00:33:03,638
Scott: Mm-hmm.

536
00:33:04,461 --> 00:33:05,806
Rym: I don't need a full-frame camera.

537
00:33:05,826 --> 00:33:06,669
Rym: We're not we're not.

538
00:33:06,729 --> 00:33:08,010
Scott: no I don't have a full-frame camera.

539
00:33:11,137 --> 00:33:16,970
Rym: In the better moment the geek notes book club book is Emily Wilson's translation of the Odyssey by Homer.

540
00:33:17,151 --> 00:33:22,456
Scott: I read all the you know, the famous parts with the sirens and oh, yeah I gotta catch up.

541
00:33:22,496 --> 00:33:23,382
Rym: then we got to finish it.

542
00:33:23,443 --> 00:33:25,637
Rym: if you're reading at that rate I'll finish the book also.

543
00:33:25,677 --> 00:33:27,710
Scott: that part is for being the most famous part.

544
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,218
Scott: That is the most adapted.

545
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,490
Scott: it's like one is like less than a page long.

546
00:33:31,691 --> 00:33:36,630
Scott: Yeah, it's like all that stuff happens in this one chapter and it's like people think that that's the whole Odyssey.

547
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:37,814
Scott: That's like a few pages.

548
00:33:37,854 --> 00:33:39,821
Rym: I think it's just American kids in high school.

549
00:33:39,861 --> 00:33:42,590
Rym: They only read like three sections of the Odyssey.

550
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,477
Scott: No, I think it's that you know.

551
00:33:44,537 --> 00:33:49,589
Scott: popular culture adapted this one part of the Odyssey so heavily Yeah, and ignored all the other parts.

552
00:33:49,751 --> 00:33:55,216
Rym: But most of the people we talked to like you guys fans who were talking or like reading the book with us None of them remembered any of this.

553
00:33:55,236 --> 00:33:56,821
Rym: telemic is stuff like.

554
00:33:56,841 --> 00:33:57,764
Rym: I don't remembered the.

555
00:33:58,045 --> 00:34:02,936
Rym: everyone thinks the book starts Odyssey.

556
00:34:03,017 --> 00:34:09,126
Scott: or if you read the pop-up book You should read this real new adaptation of the book so you can actually understand what the whole deal is.

557
00:34:09,186 --> 00:34:13,069
Rym: cuz I bet you don't Yep, and we're gonna do a whole show on it and we're gonna assume you also.

558
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:18,190
Scott: I hope she finishes that Iliad because all the others does is make me like want to read the Iliad.

559
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:22,739
Scott: That's where all the Agamemnon Anything she translates Achilles is.

560
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,429
Scott: I'm going to listen my boys this doesn't have my boys in it.

561
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:28,123
Rym: So I'm gonna read every if she go if she does more Greek stuff.

562
00:34:28,164 --> 00:34:28,666
Rym: I'll read it all.

563
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:29,228
Rym: and what is she?

564
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,963
Scott: what if she translates Antigone?

565
00:34:30,983 --> 00:34:34,725
Scott: know the the story of Rym Mel Pupo.

566
00:34:36,551 --> 00:34:41,329
Rym: If there's a story about me written in ancient Greek, I feel like I need to read it.

567
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,841
Scott: Yeah, it talks about awful.

568
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,138
Scott: You are you're the worst If you read.

569
00:34:46,178 --> 00:34:46,842
Scott: there was a Rym.

570
00:34:46,882 --> 00:34:47,869
Scott: he was the worst the end.

571
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:51,542
Rym: Do you have you read like Antigone or like any of that stuff?

572
00:34:51,603 --> 00:34:55,973
Scott: I think the one I actually want to read is this What was it?

573
00:34:56,172 --> 00:34:56,876
Scott: I forget what.

574
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:00,370
Scott: it is some guy with an X in his name and it's a story about like Xenophon.

575
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,756
Scott: It's one of those Xenophon stuff.

576
00:35:02,937 --> 00:35:04,561
Scott: This is why I forget what it was.

577
00:35:04,581 --> 00:35:06,627
Rym: I think you're thinking of Xenophon.

578
00:35:06,727 --> 00:35:07,609
Scott: There's something like that.

579
00:35:08,714 --> 00:35:13,510
Scott: It was a story about like a Traveling through Turkey or something on some sort of adventure.

580
00:35:14,631 --> 00:35:16,401
Scott: Apparently a lot of stuff is based on this store.

581
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,010
Scott: Oh the one that the Warriors is based on.

582
00:35:19,811 --> 00:35:22,039
Rym: Okay, I just I went to Xenophon.

583
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,168
Scott: No go to the Wikipedia page for the Warriors.

584
00:35:24,308 --> 00:35:28,810
Scott: the movie And there's the Warriors is based on a book and the book is based on an ancient story.

585
00:35:29,354 --> 00:35:30,059
Rym: Oh, right.

586
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:38,690
Scott: You sent me a link to that, but That warriors right because it's about traveling through on it to go about going on this difficult journey, right?

587
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:54,770
Rym: Yeah to escape which is what about the Warriors is about and you know, so Well, let's hope Emily Wilson translates ever all this stuff Otherwise, hey, you should follow both me and Scott on YouTube because we both are uploading and also Twitter and Facebook.

588
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:59,649
Rym: But YouTube in particular because we made a new GeekNights presents Utena.

589
00:36:00,111 --> 00:36:02,498
Rym: We uploaded our last talk from PAX.

590
00:36:02,779 --> 00:36:04,404
Rym: We're uploading a lot of our panels.

591
00:36:04,685 --> 00:36:06,410
Rym: We're doing judge anime by its cover.

592
00:36:06,771 --> 00:36:08,516
Rym: We're doing GeekNights presents board games.

593
00:36:08,897 --> 00:36:10,923
Rym: There's a lot of GeekNights content on YouTube.

594
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:12,608
Rym: We'll never abandon the podcast.

595
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:19,373
Scott: but kids today tomorrow podcast the Ignites over.

596
00:36:19,393 --> 00:36:20,437
Scott: this is the last episode.

597
00:36:20,477 --> 00:36:22,364
Rym: Yes, the kids are on YouTube.

Rym: So that's where a lot of our stuff is.

599
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:27,102
Rym: So full disclosure, we do a lot of shows on food.

600
00:36:27,363 --> 00:36:27,744
Rym: Like that's.

601
00:36:28,005 --> 00:36:29,390
Scott: that's the thing we do on that side.

602
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:30,475
Scott: That's you know on Thursday.

603
00:36:30,515 --> 00:36:31,460
Scott: We run out of ideas.

604
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,470
Scott: That's what happens to send us your Thursday ideas.

605
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:42,606
Scott: Any show idea that requires no research And is not technology gaming or anime or comics or manga related?

606
00:36:42,626 --> 00:36:43,610
Rym: You know what I could do again?

607
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,817
Rym: I could let the patreon just vote on it.

608
00:36:46,178 --> 00:36:48,226
Rym: But if they vote on something bad, it's their fault.

609
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:52,329
Rym: if we do a bad show I don't want to make a bad show though, but then we'll blame it on them.

610
00:36:53,172 --> 00:36:53,996
Rym: They paid for that.

611
00:36:54,076 --> 00:36:56,204
Scott: I'm actually not too worried about making a bad show.

612
00:36:56,244 --> 00:36:57,770
Scott: I'm worried about sitting here and saying nothing.

613
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,077
Scott: Yeah, because then there's no show.

614
00:37:00,178 --> 00:37:04,457
Rym: but I feel like our thing is that it doesn't matter what the topic is We can somehow end up talking forever.

615
00:37:04,678 --> 00:37:05,822
Scott: I mean we can hopefully.

616
00:37:05,842 --> 00:37:14,917
Rym: I mean we could find a tangent and talk about The first four years of GeekNights was just well, we're gonna talk about tangent 40 minutes of tangent.

617
00:37:14,957 --> 00:37:17,996
Scott: but then I feel like I didn't do the show on the thing I was said I was gonna do.

618
00:37:18,016 --> 00:37:18,963
Scott: the show doesn't matter.

619
00:37:18,983 --> 00:37:19,809
Rym: We just got to make a show.

620
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,580
Scott: We just change the show title later on.

621
00:37:21,701 --> 00:37:23,149
Scott: Yeah, we record the intro.

622
00:37:24,532 --> 00:37:25,599
Rym: It's just GeekNights Thursday.

623
00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:30,437
Rym: They're all just called GeekNights Thursday The lounge sure.

624
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,870
Rym: so full disclosure though, we are not Indian.

625
00:37:34,412 --> 00:37:36,098
Rym: No, you're not Authority as an Indian food.

626
00:37:36,218 --> 00:37:39,330
Rym: No, I don't actually know that much about Indian food.

627
00:37:39,571 --> 00:37:44,730
Rym: No, I'm not even going to pretend that I know the regional differences of Indian food.

628
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:49,550
Rym: No with the caveat that I do know a little bit about a hydra bad food.

629
00:37:49,932 --> 00:37:52,288
Rym: Because guys you went there because I spent a lot.

630
00:37:53,072 --> 00:37:57,870
Rym: I have probably spent a total of like five or six months in Hyderabad over the years.

631
00:37:58,354 --> 00:38:07,612
Rym: Like I've spent a lot of time in Hyderabad I love Hyderabad food and the way I will describe food from Hyderabad is that you know when you get Indian food is really spicy Mm-hmm.

632
00:38:08,194 --> 00:38:12,270
Rym: So if you go to Hyderabad and you get the non spicy food, it's that spicy.

633
00:38:12,852 --> 00:38:15,383
Rym: If you get the spicy Hyderabad food, you're dead.

634
00:38:15,644 --> 00:38:15,965
Rym: You're done.

635
00:38:16,005 --> 00:38:16,327
Rym: That's it.

636
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:17,090
Rym: It's game over.

637
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:19,379
Scott: But are there people in Hyderabad eating that spicy food?

638
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,890
Rym: Oh, they're eating that food and they're complaining about how it's not that spicy.

639
00:38:23,531 --> 00:38:26,241
Rym: They as the first time I was in Hyderabad.

640
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:27,386
Rym: I was warned.

641
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:28,410
Scott: Why don't we send Judith there?

642
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,096
Rym: I was worried the food was spicy.

643
00:38:30,256 --> 00:38:32,384
Rym: cuz I was warned from my friends in Mumbai.

644
00:38:32,404 --> 00:38:35,650
Rym: They're like, yeah, just be warned Hyderabad food is spicy.

645
00:38:35,852 --> 00:38:37,025
Scott: I'm sure there are people that who live.

646
00:38:37,045 --> 00:38:44,202
Scott: if people Tend to think that when someone comes from a country that has is known for its spicy food They think like Thai people.

647
00:38:44,242 --> 00:38:45,310
Scott: they can all eat spicy food.

648
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:50,543
Scott: There's plenty of Thai people who can't eat spicy food and there's plenty of Thai food That's not spicy and they don't.

649
00:38:50,563 --> 00:38:55,089
Scott: they just eat that It's not like it's like even though a country has spicy food and is known for it.

650
00:38:55,411 --> 00:38:58,229
Scott: Don't mistakenly think that all the people there love the spicy food.

651
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:02,570
Scott: I'm sure there's people in Hyderabad who don't eat the spicy food and ask for mild food, right?

652
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,075
Scott: There's nothing wrong with that.

653
00:39:04,296 --> 00:39:07,330
Rym: There's a Thai place near us called tuk-tuk and one cool thing about it plays.

654
00:39:07,591 --> 00:39:08,376
Rym: It is a real good place.

655
00:39:08,738 --> 00:39:10,870
Rym: They have a special menu like on the back page.

656
00:39:11,311 --> 00:39:16,710
Rym: They have a menu that is five or six Thai dishes that are not in any way Americanized.

657
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,976
Rym: There's no substitutions.

658
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:20,342
Rym: they explain what they are.

659
00:39:20,423 --> 00:39:21,306
Rym: they explain the history.

660
00:39:21,366 --> 00:39:25,742
Rym: you can order them But they make it very clear if you are unable to eat it.

661
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:26,725
Rym: It's your fucking fault.

662
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:27,408
Rym: No refunds.

663
00:39:27,789 --> 00:39:27,909
Rym: Mm-hmm.

664
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,588
Scott: And I mean, isn't that the true with all restaurant food?

665
00:39:32,951 --> 00:39:37,990
Scott: If I go to a place unless the food is like poison or has you know metal shards or glass?

666
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:39,355
Scott: I don't expect the reef.

667
00:39:39,636 --> 00:39:42,150
Rym: Yeah, but I find that most people are uncooked or something.

668
00:39:42,351 --> 00:39:45,910
Scott: I think the reason is it's got to be really messed up for me to ask for my money back.

669
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:53,714
Rym: I think in this case, the reason is white folk will order this food and it is too spicy for them And then they can't eat it.

670
00:39:54,015 --> 00:39:55,661
Scott: Well, that's your home.

671
00:39:55,721 --> 00:39:55,982
Scott: Yep.

672
00:39:56,022 --> 00:40:00,526
Rym: So the menu is like listen kid This is actual Thai food.

673
00:40:00,626 --> 00:40:01,049
Scott: That's right.

674
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,838
Rym: But uh, so yeah, I got.

675
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:07,610
Rym: I got some like lamb beer out biryani cuz I was like I have some of that in my fridge.

676
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,540
Rym: Yeah, very on e tomorrow.

677
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:20,610
Rym: Maybe yeah, Hyderabad is known Specifically which I did not know then for its fucking spicy biryani And I was defeated by this dish in the hotel.

678
00:40:20,791 --> 00:40:24,769
Scott: I ever see when if I'm gonna travel to a country that doesn't speak it English, right?

679
00:40:25,671 --> 00:40:38,876
Scott: Even if you know, even if the people there do speak English, even though it's that's not their primary language Yeah, I'm always gonna make sure that the phrase I gotta learn is always please serve me your local specialty in whatever language And I'll just go there.

680
00:40:38,976 --> 00:40:48,338
Scott: and as long as it's not a thing that I don't eat which is a very short list like octopus and dolphin and whale and you anything to Monkey brain we got away.

681
00:40:48,398 --> 00:40:50,005
Scott: as long as it's not one of those things.

682
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:51,270
Scott: It's just like bring it on.

683
00:40:51,350 --> 00:41:03,077
Scott: I want to eat whatever your best thing is and however you eat it and if it kills me because it's too spicy alright, if Went out good if turkey calms down and is safe to travel to again And maybe the u.s.

684
00:41:03,137 --> 00:41:04,727
Scott: Is hardly come down and safe to travel to.

685
00:41:04,828 --> 00:41:10,429
Rym: yeah But turkey if it for that if that is what you want Istanbul is the place to go.

686
00:41:11,012 --> 00:41:14,890
Rym: You want though you want like that any restaurant you go to as an American?

687
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:18,030
Rym: They're gonna be like do you want to tribe the like our delicacy?

688
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:23,567
Rym: Do you want like they're really into the specific river fish that they get right there in Istanbul sounds good.

689
00:41:23,668 --> 00:41:24,250
Rym: It's so good.

690
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:25,739
Rym: I think I think.

691
00:41:25,779 --> 00:41:29,958
Rym: of all the places I've traveled in my life Istanbul had the best food anyway India.

692
00:41:30,078 --> 00:41:31,443
Scott: so back in the day.

693
00:41:31,463 --> 00:41:33,450
Scott: I was not big fan Indian food.

694
00:41:33,812 --> 00:41:39,285
Scott: I've always been a person Ellie not always but at least in my adult life I've always been a person who was willing to try any food.

695
00:41:39,306 --> 00:41:43,547
Rym: Oh, yeah, right It's like it was just very rare because I grew up in the Midwest.

696
00:41:43,587 --> 00:41:44,210
Scott: Yeah, it's over.

697
00:41:44,371 --> 00:41:46,362
Scott: It was right, you know my you know, my family was.

698
00:41:46,603 --> 00:41:55,649
Scott: it's weird because when I was a kid I was you know, my brother was you know, super picky like french fries and you know, I remember that We'd all eat steak and he'd have his chicken.

699
00:41:55,972 --> 00:42:00,727
Scott: I have like a piece of chicken nuggets and french fries kind of you know It seems to be a thing a lot of picky eaters do right?

700
00:42:00,747 --> 00:42:05,930
Scott: Yeah But anyway, I was less picky, but I was more picky than like my parents.

701
00:42:06,231 --> 00:42:13,098
Scott: But as when I became an adult and moved out and was able to eat a different food and not the food that was you Know given to me or available in a suburb.

702
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,529
Scott: I was like, oh other food is good.

703
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:19,289
Scott: And now my parents and my family are way pickier than I am.

704
00:42:19,811 --> 00:42:28,261
Scott: But you know, even though I was willing to try any food once right at least, you know When I tried Indian food, I wasn't really that into it.

705
00:42:28,683 --> 00:42:30,650
Scott: You know, it's like I remember I was like.

706
00:42:31,511 --> 00:42:36,767
Scott: You know, I think we were living in Beacon and there was that Indian place next to the to the dragon's den.

707
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:45,630
Scott: Oh, yeah And I went there, you know like a few times with those because you know That's where people were eating after playing games at the dragon's den, right?

708
00:42:45,991 --> 00:42:50,104
Scott: So I would go there but you know the food there wasn't really that.

709
00:42:50,244 --> 00:42:55,350
Scott: you know, it wasn't doing it for me so much Right, so I wasn't that into Indian food, but you know what?

710
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,690
Scott: You know a lot of people out there when they don't like a food, right?

711
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:05,556
Scott: They just refuse to eat it, but it's like I'm like, all right, listen, I don't like this, but you know It's not gonna poison me.

712
00:43:06,098 --> 00:43:24,006
Scott: All right, and you know, the group would be, you know The whole crew to get together like Indian food and I'd be like, man, I don't want to go Right, but then I would go because I wasn't gonna be a baby right like some people are whoever if you're, you know I'm not gonna say any names, but you know who you are, you know who you are.

713
00:43:24,247 --> 00:43:25,933
Scott: people who say no I'm not eating that.

714
00:43:25,993 --> 00:43:29,765
Scott: I mean obviously allergies, you know vegetarians vegans.

715
00:43:29,785 --> 00:43:33,236
Scott: That's all valid excuses Things like that, right?

716
00:43:33,296 --> 00:43:33,858
Scott: I'm talking about.

717
00:43:33,899 --> 00:43:34,662
Rym: I don't like like.

718
00:43:34,823 --> 00:43:35,647
Rym: I don't like natto.

719
00:43:35,707 --> 00:43:37,315
Scott: I'm just yeah I don't like not to either.

720
00:43:37,355 --> 00:43:40,290
Scott: but you know what if everyone's like, hey, let's go to the natto place.

721
00:43:40,692 --> 00:43:43,463
Scott: I'm not gonna be that, you know socially ruining person.

722
00:43:43,483 --> 00:43:44,086
Scott: Yeah, I'll go.

723
00:43:44,387 --> 00:43:48,682
Scott: maybe I'll go Order a natto and begrudgingly eat it slowly like an adult.

724
00:43:48,702 --> 00:43:49,666
Rym: That's one difference between us.

725
00:43:49,866 --> 00:43:50,850
Rym: You'll begrudgingly eat.

726
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:52,860
Rym: I'm half perfectly willing to go hungry.

727
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:54,870
Scott: Oh, you'll go hungry and not even eat the natto.

728
00:43:55,092 --> 00:43:57,412
Rym: I will happily go hungry rather than eat food I don't like.

729
00:43:57,613 --> 00:44:07,479
Rym: the other thing I'll do is I'll find something on the menu to eat if there is right like especially like You know a lot of times I don't understand the kind of person who can go to a restaurant And there's not one goddamn thing on that menu.

730
00:44:07,499 --> 00:44:07,801
Rym: They'll eat.

731
00:44:07,921 --> 00:44:11,374
Scott: even if I go to like a super seafood restaurant There's always like one steak on there.

732
00:44:11,394 --> 00:44:14,082
Rym: Yeah, right cuz there's always the baby meal.

733
00:44:14,102 --> 00:44:16,488
Scott: There's always a hamburger and I wouldn't do that.

734
00:44:16,549 --> 00:44:19,915
Scott: But Anyway It's the thing.

735
00:44:19,955 --> 00:44:27,538
Scott: the point is that I'm trying to make is that you know I was not a big fan of Indian food, even though he had tried quite a few different dishes There were some things I like.

736
00:44:27,578 --> 00:44:28,525
Scott: like who doesn't like a naan?

737
00:44:28,706 --> 00:44:29,290
Scott: right as a brand?

738
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:32,641
Scott: Yeah, but you know, I wasn't into it, but we can't tolerant people.

739
00:44:32,761 --> 00:44:33,503
Rym: people kept.

740
00:44:33,544 --> 00:44:35,530
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure they like it.

741
00:44:35,571 --> 00:44:43,730
Scott: They just came in We kept going to eat it over and over again and I kept trying different things there and discovering new things.

742
00:44:43,911 --> 00:44:53,390
Scott: You know new things on the Indian, you know restaurant menus And trying different styles of Indian food and now I order any food on my own for delivery.

743
00:44:53,631 --> 00:45:03,769
Scott: yeah, right and I think the thing is is a lot of people who don't like a thing and They don't even want to try it and it's like just keep begrudgingly eating it and develop a taste for it.

744
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:17,706
Rym: now Well, I've noticed I've known a lot of people There's a thing where people will try food that is from a particular Region or ethnicity or nation and if they don't like it They assume that that region's food is all one.

745
00:45:17,827 --> 00:45:20,216
Rym: that exact thing They just tried to eat and to bet.

746
00:45:20,337 --> 00:45:22,726
Scott: imagine if someone tried a hamburger like.

747
00:45:22,746 --> 00:45:23,690
Scott: I don't like American food.

748
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:24,995
Scott: So now they won't try fried chicken.

749
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:26,319
Scott: Yep, which is American food.

750
00:45:26,379 --> 00:45:26,620
Scott: Awesome.

751
00:45:26,761 --> 00:45:27,463
Scott: Yeah, right.

752
00:45:27,764 --> 00:45:29,089
Scott: It's like that's not right.

753
00:45:30,093 --> 00:45:34,550
Scott: Another thing I think that happens is the people get a bad first impression and pass a judgment.

754
00:45:34,791 --> 00:45:37,870
Scott: Yeah, and unlike anime where you can totally do that just fine.

755
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:40,403
Scott: They'll try say a bat.

756
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:44,886
Scott: They'll try a fruit and that fruit that they try for the first time this new fruit.

757
00:45:44,926 --> 00:45:47,714
Scott: Maybe it's like Not a durian.

758
00:45:47,994 --> 00:45:51,525
Scott: They'll try like a mango for the first time and they'll try a mango.

759
00:45:51,686 --> 00:45:52,949
Scott: That's not ripe and delicious.

760
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:58,205
Scott: And then they'll judge all mangoes and now they won't drink a mango lassi.

761
00:45:58,366 --> 00:45:58,687
Rym: So it's got.

762
00:45:58,727 --> 00:45:59,430
Scott: I know you don't watch.

763
00:46:00,331 --> 00:46:01,716
Rym: It's always sunny in Philadelphia.

764
00:46:01,736 --> 00:46:09,265
Rym: Mm-hmm, but there's a scene that is relevant to your interests Where basically there's one guy who's like never been outside of Philly in his entire life.

765
00:46:09,747 --> 00:46:10,733
Rym: Okay, that's his deal like.

766
00:46:10,753 --> 00:46:16,647
Scott: he's a character like When I was in Florida in the 90s like late 90s, or maybe he was even too early 2000s.

767
00:46:18,213 --> 00:46:29,984
Scott: I needed a haircut because it was too hot and I still had hair And I just went to a rando haircut place and the lady who cut my hair who was in her 40s or something at the time I just went wherever she told me she had never.

768
00:46:30,065 --> 00:46:30,990
Scott: she was like, oh, where are you from?

769
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:33,421
Scott: Like oh, I'm from you know, I guess I was in.

770
00:46:33,441 --> 00:46:40,329
Scott: I don't know if I was in New York or Connecticut, but whatever She's like I never left Florida Emma her whole life and she was like 40 or 50.

771
00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:51,281
Rym: something I mean, I read saw a statistic a while ago that a good 20% of Americans have never lived outside of the county They were born it but I mean she'd never left period traveled.

772
00:46:51,402 --> 00:46:54,110
Scott: No, not even in a car not even to, Georgia.

773
00:46:55,511 --> 00:46:57,116
Rym: Well, at least New York City.

774
00:46:57,597 --> 00:47:01,850
Rym: I'm more willing to accept why someone might live that way cuz I've been outside of New York.

775
00:47:01,911 --> 00:47:07,290
Rym: So I'm just saying But so this scene so this dude who's never enough out of Philly.

776
00:47:07,531 --> 00:47:13,944
Rym: They're having some like normal Steinfeld style conversation and it turns out he's never had a pair Doesn't even know what a pair is.

777
00:47:13,984 --> 00:47:14,449
Rym: He's never.

778
00:47:15,991 --> 00:47:26,395
Rym: So they're like you gotta get a pair and they like stop at a market and they're like buy a pair from like a dude And they hand it to him fights into it and he's like, ah, no, I don't like this I don't like this at all.

779
00:47:26,415 --> 00:47:27,682
Rym: They're like what what he can it's a pair.

780
00:47:27,702 --> 00:47:28,325
Rym: What do you not like about?

781
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:33,524
Rym: he's like it's Sandy and bland and then they look it like oh, it's not a right pair.

782
00:47:33,564 --> 00:47:34,828
Rym: and there's this whole thing about the.

783
00:47:34,848 --> 00:47:35,129
Rym: it's true.

784
00:47:35,416 --> 00:47:35,730
Scott: It's true.

785
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:41,694
Scott: See pairs are one of those things where they're only good if you get the right variety of pair and it's perfectly Ripened the right amount.

786
00:47:41,754 --> 00:47:43,862
Scott: Otherwise, it just tastes like a nothing fruit.

787
00:47:43,922 --> 00:47:46,070
Scott: if it's ripe, then it's a sweet and sugary.

788
00:47:46,411 --> 00:47:48,820
Scott: But the thing about pear is unlike other fruits.

789
00:47:49,181 --> 00:47:51,610
Scott: It doesn't sort of have a flavor to go along with its sweetness.

790
00:47:51,751 --> 00:47:53,704
Scott: It's literally like just sweet and that's it.

791
00:47:53,845 --> 00:47:57,205
Scott: It tastes like pear Yeah, but pear doesn't have a strong flavor the way.

792
00:47:57,245 --> 00:47:58,010
Scott: see certain apples.

793
00:47:58,271 --> 00:47:59,896
Scott: Yeah, have a strong there's then there's.

794
00:47:59,916 --> 00:48:03,549
Rym: you want to really taste certain other apples that just taste like sweet.

795
00:48:03,689 --> 00:48:08,809
Rym: Yes It's true, but all pairs look at you read delicious You're the worst Apple exactly.

796
00:48:09,251 --> 00:48:15,070
Scott: But the point is if you want to taste a really good pair the best way to taste really the best pair.

797
00:48:15,451 --> 00:48:16,495
Scott: Just get canned pear.

798
00:48:16,816 --> 00:48:20,970
Scott: Yeah, get canned pear bits in pear juice at the store and just eat it with a spoon.

799
00:48:21,413 --> 00:48:28,623
Rym: That is probably the best pair that I was a kid I would just open up a can of canned pears and just eat it, right They're actually at the grocery store.

800
00:48:28,644 --> 00:48:30,674
Scott: when I was a kid There was actually it would.

801
00:48:30,714 --> 00:48:35,330
Scott: they sold canned pear as like yours as snack as like you a pack.

802
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:36,439
Rym: Oh, yeah, I had those two.

803
00:48:36,459 --> 00:48:37,265
Scott: I hate those.

804
00:48:37,386 --> 00:48:39,590
Scott: like every day I'd eat I'd always been up a can of pear and eat it.

805
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:50,004
Rym: So in high school, and then I drink the juice instead of bringing the small can pair with a little like Big like I brought a big one and a can opener I do that with pineapple.

806
00:48:50,044 --> 00:48:52,300
Scott: these days I don't buy a whole pineapple.

807
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,450
Scott: I'll buy a can of pineapple.

808
00:48:54,712 --> 00:48:55,657
Scott: It comes in rings.

809
00:48:55,778 --> 00:48:56,965
Scott: Anyway, Indian food.

810
00:48:57,025 --> 00:49:02,226
Scott: So in food I the point I was trying to make earlier about developing a taste for something right is.

811
00:49:02,246 --> 00:49:09,019
Scott: a lot of people make the argument Oh, you could develop a taste for alcohol And or develop a taste for smoking and all these harmful activities.

812
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:12,790
Scott: and it's like no because harmful activities don't develop a taste for them.

813
00:49:13,152 --> 00:49:15,123
Scott: But something like Indian food is not harmful.

814
00:49:15,183 --> 00:49:16,310
Scott: It's good for you and delicious.

815
00:49:16,593 --> 00:49:24,489
Scott: So even if you don't like it at first You should try to develop a taste for it because it will benefit you in life and also bring you joy without harming you.

816
00:49:24,509 --> 00:49:32,902
Scott: so You know if there are things in life that are good and would be good if you like them Even if you don't like them originally, you should try to develop a taste for them.

817
00:49:32,942 --> 00:49:35,330
Scott: Maybe you don't like sci-fi novels.

818
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:36,897
Scott: Well, try to read it's.

819
00:49:36,937 --> 00:49:37,459
Scott: they're good.

820
00:49:37,479 --> 00:49:38,424
Scott: So try to read a few.

821
00:49:38,484 --> 00:49:39,890
Scott: maybe you'll develop a taste for them.

822
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:42,822
Scott: You should at least try a little bit, you know Indian food.

823
00:49:42,842 --> 00:49:44,068
Scott: You should try drugs.

824
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:48,995
Scott: No, don't Develop a taste for the meter if you could Depending on the drug.

825
00:49:49,035 --> 00:49:52,210
Rym: I mean my dad is really excited about his medical marijuana card.

826
00:49:52,331 --> 00:49:55,069
Scott: I'm talking like, you know, don't develop a taste for heroin guys.

827
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:58,828
Scott: Yeah, that's that's even though you could get used to shooting yourself up.

828
00:49:58,868 --> 00:50:02,360
Scott: do not But do get used to curry cuz it's delicious.

829
00:50:02,401 --> 00:50:04,510
Scott: Even if you don't like it at first maybe try again.

830
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,979
Rym: We've already been going for like an hour halfway.

831
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,167
Scott: Yeah, we didn't have any Indian foods though.

832
00:50:09,187 --> 00:50:09,548
Rym: Let's go.

833
00:50:09,588 --> 00:50:10,070
Rym: Let's go through.

834
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:12,298
Rym: Let's just do a best of an Indian food.

835
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:14,827
Rym: All right, so we're only talking about our personal.

836
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:15,570
Rym: we gotta start.

837
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:16,593
Scott: We got to start with Rym.

838
00:50:16,633 --> 00:50:16,854
Scott: Mr.

839
00:50:16,894 --> 00:50:17,817
Scott: Samosa Samosa.

840
00:50:18,178 --> 00:50:20,344
Rym: I fucking love Samosa.

841
00:50:20,364 --> 00:50:21,227
Scott: They are delicious.

842
00:50:21,367 --> 00:50:22,410
Rym: Oh my god.

843
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:25,241
Scott: First of all, it's fried.

844
00:50:25,261 --> 00:50:30,199
Scott: It's got this fried shell which is delicious and Inside the fried shell is chickpeas.

845
00:50:30,439 --> 00:50:37,303
Scott: Yeah inside the fried shell is potato, you know Like mashed potato potato and chickpeas are two of my favorite things on earth.

846
00:50:37,563 --> 00:50:38,567
Scott: and in that potato.

847
00:50:38,627 --> 00:50:42,810
Scott: It's not just potato It's potato that's been flavored up with all kinds of spices and shit.

848
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:45,438
Scott: So it looks all yellow or green or yellow and green.

849
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:52,200
Scott: and then the potato is filled with like peas and chickpeas and other Delicious naughty bits that are in that potato.

850
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:55,110
Scott: and then it's all been fried and it's nice and warm and toasty.

851
00:50:55,190 --> 00:51:03,859
Scott: And then you dip it in either the red stuff, which is sweet and fruity kind of The green stuff.

852
00:51:03,919 --> 00:51:11,587
Scott: and you know what when I get Samosa they when you get ordered delivery They give you two samosas dip in both Alternating and they give you a red and they give you a green.

853
00:51:11,627 --> 00:51:12,090
Scott: and you know what?

854
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:19,849
Scott: I randomly pick one or based on my mood and I eat the first samosa in that and then the next day I heat up The other one and eat it in the other cup.

855
00:51:20,152 --> 00:51:23,515
Scott: So I think the last one I got I got red So I got a green one.

856
00:51:23,555 --> 00:51:25,224
Rym: that's the difference Emily and I reorder.

857
00:51:25,385 --> 00:51:27,675
Rym: when we order Indian food We get a samosa.

858
00:51:28,137 --> 00:51:28,719
Rym: it comes with two.

859
00:51:28,759 --> 00:51:29,341
Rym: we each eat one.

860
00:51:29,863 --> 00:51:30,967
Rym: There's never one left over.

861
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:31,710
Scott: I got it left over.

862
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:32,453
Scott: I'm only one person.

863
00:51:33,136 --> 00:51:36,770
Rym: So in terms of naan garlic naan is one of my favorite foods on earth.

864
00:51:36,971 --> 00:51:40,350
Scott: I mean, I like all naans and I sort of just keep picking different flavors of naan.

865
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:41,536
Scott: I'll even eat the plain naan.

866
00:51:41,737 --> 00:51:46,196
Scott: you get more naan flavor because a lot of times the you know Onion naan or a garlic naan will cover up.

867
00:51:46,256 --> 00:51:49,306
Rym: but you need the naan to scoop the food together to finish it.

868
00:51:49,868 --> 00:51:52,626
Rym: Mm-hmm I do like the rosemary naan quite a bit.

869
00:51:53,632 --> 00:51:54,857
Scott: That's what my least favorite naan.

870
00:51:54,878 --> 00:52:00,259
Scott: maybe cheese naan is the naan that I think I like a lot But I don't go for it too often because it's too powerful.

871
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:00,821
Rym: Yep.

872
00:52:01,002 --> 00:52:07,578
Rym: It's a. it's too filling and strong same with Oh Is one of my favorite things.

873
00:52:07,598 --> 00:52:08,581
Scott: the poor II feels.

874
00:52:08,621 --> 00:52:13,058
Scott: when you order a poor you feel like you're wasting your money because you're paying Basically a lot of money for a lot of nothing.

875
00:52:13,118 --> 00:52:14,263
Rym: It's basically a bread balloon.

876
00:52:14,684 --> 00:52:21,547
Scott: Yeah, it's like so thin You're but it's it feels like eating like just the crust of a bread like you're peeling the crust off of a bread.

877
00:52:21,608 --> 00:52:22,330
Scott: It's so good.

878
00:52:23,753 --> 00:52:24,968
Scott: We're only eating the crust.

879
00:52:26,371 --> 00:52:31,250
Scott: But yeah, it's basically just a balloon of bread and you pop it and then you eat it and it's delicious.

880
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:34,881
Rym: I'm a real in terms of like core Indian food like main dishes.

881
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:37,690
Rym: I think the sogs are my favorite types.

882
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:41,299
Rym: Green spinach II maybe with the cheese like that.

883
00:52:41,319 --> 00:52:42,463
Rym: That's my go-to.

884
00:52:42,844 --> 00:52:43,185
Scott: Mm-hmm.

885
00:52:43,466 --> 00:52:46,049
Rym: Not the chicken tikka masala That's like the American defaulting.

886
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:51,810
Scott: Well, I actually like a chicken tikka masala but some places don't spice it up enough and it's just bland as hell.

887
00:52:52,111 --> 00:52:53,420
Scott: Yeah, you gotta have a place where it's.

888
00:52:53,561 --> 00:53:01,292
Scott: you know, it doesn't need to be hot spicy But it needs to have lots of you know aroma going on and some places do it in some places make it Land.

889
00:53:01,332 --> 00:53:02,618
Scott: super bland is not good.

890
00:53:02,758 --> 00:53:05,530
Rym: I like the Rogan Josh too, but sometimes it's just like a Rogan Josh.

891
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:07,878
Rym: Sometimes it gets a little too spicy for me.

892
00:53:08,139 --> 00:53:09,243
Scott: No, that's not too spicy.

893
00:53:09,263 --> 00:53:14,229
Scott: The thing that gets too spicy for me is What's it called chicken?

894
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:19,870
Scott: The chicken why we know where it's all covered in the hot red stuff where it's like just super on fire.

895
00:53:20,871 --> 00:53:22,096
Rym: Not that not the tandoori chicken.

896
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:25,310
Scott: No, the tandoori chicken is the one where it's not in a curry, right?

897
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,214
Scott: It's just on its own.

898
00:53:26,576 --> 00:53:28,748
Scott: Yep, and it's you put that in a nice yogurt sauce.

899
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:33,040
Rym: I love that Favorite actually my favorite thing to eat, but I can't anymore cuz I'm old on that.

900
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:40,980
Rym: heartburn is like tandoori chicken and biryani together Mmm, but as an adult that is too powerful.

901
00:53:41,521 --> 00:53:42,404
Rym: That is too much.

902
00:53:42,604 --> 00:53:43,968
Scott: Just bringing up the menu here.

903
00:53:44,329 --> 00:53:46,178
Rym: Yeah I'm just looking through the Wikipedia.

904
00:53:46,198 --> 00:53:47,627
Rym: I'm just getting real hungry.

905
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,230
Rym: Look at all this.

906
00:53:51,373 --> 00:53:55,310
Rym: The meta point is that I actually don't know enough about Indian food.

907
00:53:56,391 --> 00:53:58,300
Scott: Vindaloo that's the one that's too.

908
00:53:58,341 --> 00:53:59,386
Scott: Vindaloo is delicious.

909
00:53:59,426 --> 00:54:00,170
Scott: I love vindaloo.

910
00:54:00,591 --> 00:54:07,590
Scott: I'll order it sometimes but that actually usually it doesn't go into so hot that I'm like needing to eat snow and ice or something.

911
00:54:07,976 --> 00:54:16,623
Scott: but it's usually like crosses the border of my heat tolerance like by like one step and then my head ends up breaking out into sweat and My mouth hurts a little bit,

912
00:54:16,927 --> 00:54:21,430
Rym: but I guess When I'm at a good Indian restaurant, I'm ordering from a place in New York.

913
00:54:21,954 --> 00:54:34,556
Rym: There was a lot of options And I don't know that much about Indian food in that depending on what I order I might not actually be a hundred percent sure Exactly what I'm gonna get.

914
00:54:34,576 --> 00:54:35,278
Rym: Mm-hmm.

915
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,186
Scott: And I've never been super wrong.

916
00:54:38,674 --> 00:54:39,378
Rym: I I'm always.

917
00:54:39,438 --> 00:54:51,583
Scott: I know that I'm gonna get some kind of meat Probably in some kind of sauce or curry or something and I'm gonna put it on rice and based on some of the words I might have a vague idea like something something sog.

918
00:54:51,623 --> 00:54:52,828
Rym: It's gonna be the green stuff.

919
00:54:53,129 --> 00:54:53,249
Scott: Mm-hmm.

920
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:55,839
Rym: But I'm always weirded out when we go to Indian place.

921
00:54:55,879 --> 00:54:56,181
Scott: Korma.

922
00:54:56,221 --> 00:54:58,610
Scott: It's gonna be like the yellow white stuff, right?

923
00:54:58,911 --> 00:54:59,741
Rym: I really love doll.

924
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:01,755
Rym: Oh my god I was like my go-to really.

925
00:55:02,217 --> 00:55:05,168
Rym: but a lot of people we know a lot of people I've encountered over the years.

926
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:14,597
Rym: they Won't order anything from any restaurant let alone any place unless they know every detail of exactly What is it now if you like?

927
00:55:14,637 --> 00:55:24,116
Scott: I said if you're allergic or have some sort of dietary Right, but if you don't have that kind of restriction Not just Indian food.

928
00:55:24,156 --> 00:55:25,262
Scott: you just order whatever.

929
00:55:25,362 --> 00:55:26,388
Scott: don't ask them to change it.

930
00:55:27,112 --> 00:55:29,042
Scott: Everything on the menu is delicious delicious.

931
00:55:29,082 --> 00:55:29,685
Scott: If no one liked it.

932
00:55:29,705 --> 00:55:30,530
Scott: They won't put it on there.

933
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:32,764
Scott: Just keep ordering stuff and keep trying.

934
00:55:32,784 --> 00:55:33,790
Rym: This has been a problem though.

935
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:41,158
Rym: Sometimes we've gone out with a lot of people to get some Indian food and I don't remember what I ordered And I don't care what I get.

936
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,972
Rym: nope, so whatever plate ends up in front of me I just eat.

937
00:55:44,434 --> 00:55:44,554
Scott: Mm-hmm.

938
00:55:45,057 --> 00:55:49,435
Rym: And sometimes I've eaten someone else's dish and then they come out with the thing I ordered and I'm in trouble.

939
00:55:49,776 --> 00:55:49,997
Scott: Oh, well.

940
00:55:50,699 --> 00:55:56,589
Scott: Oh the last thing we can't neglect to mention which I already mentioned a little bit Is the mango lassi the the king of?

941
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:59,779
Rym: Promode is the rose loss.

942
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:00,944
Scott: No, that's your promo.

943
00:56:01,045 --> 00:56:02,250
Scott: I don't like the rose loss.

944
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:10,209
Rym: You're really only supposed to get that for like weddings, but there's a few places I know in New York that'll serve that and I always get it if it's on the menu.

945
00:56:12,172 --> 00:56:14,018
Scott: Do not I get the regular mango lassi.

946
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:14,921
Scott: I don't eat no roses.

947
00:56:15,263 --> 00:56:16,587
