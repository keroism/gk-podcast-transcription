1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,800
Emily: So a Sifa comes through again with some free movie tickets for me and my plus one.

2
00:00:06,121 --> 00:00:11,300
Rym: So we went to the wrong movie the first night and it ended up being ready player one.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,460
Rym: So we just left and got dinner.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,760
Emily: We didn't, we didn't actually go into the theater, but it was one of those small screening rooms.

5
00:00:18,141 --> 00:00:20,019
Emily: Like the way we saw frozen, right.

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,840
Emily: Was, uh, the first time I saw frozen, it was in this tiny little box theater.

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:32,238
Emily: The kind that, you know, when a film is in progress, they'll show it to a test audience to kind of get a sense of how people react to the film.

8
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:36,880
Emily: And this was one of those, you know, it was in this Dolby sound theater.

9
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:38,940
Emily: I don't think we had been there before.

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,099
Emily: It was a different one than the one Frozen was at.

11
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,620
Rym: It seems like these things are hidden in buildings all over Manhattan.

12
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:51,560
Emily: Yeah, it's, it's basically like a skyscraper will have a built-in movie theater, even maybe partly for like client presentations.

13
00:00:51,903 --> 00:00:53,879
Emily: I don't really know that much about it.

14
00:00:54,281 --> 00:01:02,300
Emily: But anyway, occasionally through my, uh, I'm part of this animated, uh, short kind of film festival.

15
00:01:03,102 --> 00:01:09,080
Emily: And it's an international society and you get a lot of perks like, uh, figure drawing classes and stuff for being a member.

16
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:19,940
Emily: And one of the things is they'll send out these emails and being like, oh, Fox Searchlight is doing a free screening for people who are members of the academy or members of various professional organizations.

17
00:01:20,603 --> 00:01:22,820
Emily: And so if you send them an email, they'll give you tickets.

18
00:01:23,423 --> 00:01:26,319
Emily: And, uh, that's how we sell the box trolls and Kubo.

19
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:35,900
Emily: That's, uh, we've, we've seen a bunch of stuff like that, but anyway, so this was kind of nice because I, I felt about this movie.

20
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,096
Emily: Like I saw the trailers and I really, I saw Fantastic Mr.

21
00:01:40,156 --> 00:01:41,100
Emily: Fox recently.

22
00:01:42,062 --> 00:01:45,360
Emily: And I was kind of unsure how this one would turn out.

23
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,860
Emily: Cause it was very like, you see the trailer, it's very like Japanese, but by Wes Anderson.

24
00:01:52,062 --> 00:01:54,240
Emily: And so everybody's kind of raising their eyebrows.

25
00:01:55,242 --> 00:02:06,360
Rym: Like before we went in to see it, I probably would have been less suspicious of it, but a lot of press already came out pointing out some very deep flaws in the movie.

26
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:14,640
Rym: So I went in expecting that and that aspect of it, like I did enjoy the film, but that aspect of it was way worse than I expected.

27
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:16,520
Emily: Well, I don't know if it was worse.

28
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:36,560
Emily: It was actually very similar to how I expected, but like I had been talking when I was at the screening with one of my friends who's another animator and she's of Japanese heritage and she was kind of like, I don't know, like I really like Wes Anderson's animation.

29
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:38,046
Emily: She liked Fantastic Mr.

30
00:02:38,086 --> 00:02:41,520
Emily: Fox, but she was also kind of skeptical about this whole setting.

31
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:46,999
Emily: And, uh, I was also commiserating like, yeah, I totally get where you're coming from.

32
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:49,880
Emily: But I went into it cautiously optimistic.

33
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:59,300
Emily: And I guess my take on it was I really liked the movie, but there's also some flaws we need to talk about.

34
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,699
Rym: And they're pretty deep in the guys.

35
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,038
Rym: The longer I stew on the movie after I watched it, the more uncomfortable it makes me.

36
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,800
Emily: Well, let's talk about the things we liked, right?

37
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:14,699
Emily: So one it's the same style of stop motion animation as Fantastic Mr.

38
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:14,920
Emily: Fox.

39
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:16,078
Emily: It's very textured.

40
00:03:16,543 --> 00:03:16,704
Emily: Like.

41
00:03:16,744 --> 00:03:24,240
Emily: there's a lot of detail in it, but it's not that very smooth 3D printed quality that, say, Kubo had.

42
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:32,358
Emily: And I loved the aesthetic of the film in terms of like the way it made use of ruins and decay.

43
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:43,340
Rym: Because, like I said, it told a very dark story and the characters were appropriately, like everything was dark and broken and violent and kind of gory at times.

44
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,299
Rym: It didn't shy away from those aspects of the story it was going to try to tell.

45
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,300
Emily: It was kind of a gross movie.

46
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:54,020
Emily: Like there's this scene at the beginning where the dogs, so all the dogs are banished to Garbage Island.

47
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,800
Emily: And so there's this quarantine on dogs because they have the illness and dog flu.

48
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:03,800
Emily: And so they're all on this prison island and they eat garbage.

49
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:08,660
Emily: There's this one point where they open up a bag of garbage after getting into a fight with other dogs.

50
00:04:09,003 --> 00:04:10,940
Emily: It's just like crawling with maggots.

51
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:16,519
Emily: And like these little miniatures of the spoiled food just look so gross.

52
00:04:17,462 --> 00:04:21,100
Emily: Like it looks realistically spoiled and gnarly and nasty.

53
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,620
Rym: Yep, and I mean a lot of the dogs have injuries and they're just very, very bare and present.

54
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,700
Emily: In that same fight, doesn't like the main dog bite off somebody's ear and then you see a rat carrying the ear away?

55
00:04:34,762 --> 00:04:38,880
Emily: It's like they get into a fight with these poodles and the poodles are like, and one loses an ear.

56
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,680
Emily: It's like, hey, he bit off your ear.

57
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:42,559
Emily: Oh, damn it.

58
00:04:44,402 --> 00:04:47,177
Emily: And so it's definitely grotesque.

59
00:04:48,423 --> 00:04:49,920
Emily: Like the character designs too.

60
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,840
Emily: Some of the character designs are like, you know, they're kind of creepy and grotesque.

61
00:04:56,663 --> 00:05:00,380
Emily: And they're not pleasant to look at, I guess.

62
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,040
Rym: I mean, everything's dirty because it's Garbage Island.

63
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,280
Rym: Like they set it up to be this terrifying place.

64
00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:08,820
Rym: Basically concentration camp where they're going to murder all the dogs.

65
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:16,639
Emily: Yeah, so basically going into it, I was kind of imagining it was going to be like the great escape sort of thing where it's like.

66
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:20,480
Emily: these dogs are in this prison and they've got to escape the prison.

67
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,720
Emily: But it was actually a little bit more complicated than that.

68
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,339
Emily: It wasn't just an escape story.

69
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:31,020
Emily: It was like a journey story where they're trying to find this other pack of dogs.

70
00:05:31,221 --> 00:05:34,040
Emily: And there was also this whole conspiracy with the government.

71
00:05:34,582 --> 00:05:40,000
Emily: And so I also like the voice acting like for the for the American.

72
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,540
Rym: Yeah, I mean, it was an all star cast.

73
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:49,460
Rym: So even then, that's kind of where the problems come in, too, because it's it's all basically like American white male coated dogs.

74
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:51,566
Emily: Yeah, there's the one.

75
00:05:51,586 --> 00:06:01,560
Rym: the one girl character exists solely to be the one dog who isn't dirty and beautiful and untouchable and the sex object for one of the other main character dogs.

76
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:05,400
Rym: And pretty much that's literally the extent of that character.

77
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:19,240
Emily: They could have mitigated that by making like one or two of their original pack female dogs, because I mean, dog packs, they're not like, oh, all of a sudden there's only male dogs or male wolves roaming together.

78
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:19,924
Emily: That's silly.

79
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,340
Emily: Like dog packs are mixed.

80
00:06:22,721 --> 00:06:26,260
Emily: So there was no real reason for it to be only dudes.

81
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:29,500
Emily: But there was like this one beauty dog.

82
00:06:30,341 --> 00:06:33,940
Emily: She was untouchable, you know, and she she licked her fur clean.

83
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:45,820
Rym: But I guess that the conceit as the trailer showed was that, you know, it's set in this future Japan and everyone just speaks their native language.

84
00:06:46,062 --> 00:06:48,900
Rym: So you'll just have people speaking in Japanese that you can understand.

85
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:51,920
Rym: And then the only translated characters would be the dogs.

86
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:56,080
Rym: But yet the movie really breaks that conceit constantly.

87
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:59,520
Rym: By translating everything one way or another.

88
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,200
Rym: So it says like, oh, there will be subtitles.

89
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,599
Rym: And then it just ends up subtitling a bunch of stuff.

90
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:07,320
Rym: Or some other character will just translate everything.

91
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,620
Emily: The interesting thing is to seeing different people's takes on this movie.

92
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:20,700
Emily: Like I've seen some people writing about this film, writing as Japanese people saying that they thought it was kind of interesting.

93
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:27,839
Emily: And they're like, I'm surprised that an American director, like usually working in English, would make a movie like this.

94
00:07:28,942 --> 00:07:35,840
Emily: Some people didn't seem as put off by it, but obviously didn't consider it a Japanese film.

95
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:40,380
Emily: I saw other people of Japanese heritage saying it made them very uncomfortable.

96
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,580
Emily: But one thing I will say is it was strange seeing it as somebody who's like relatively bilingual.

97
00:07:48,821 --> 00:07:54,920
Emily: I'm not a native speaker, but I speak enough Japanese that I don't, I can watch movies without subtitles.

98
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:03,359
Emily: And so I think a little bit of the hiding the meaning of the dialogue was lost on me.

99
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,780
Rym: Of course it didn't matter because the dialogue was almost always completely worthless.

100
00:08:08,182 --> 00:08:13,740
Rym: Or it was actually just an excuse to do a bunch of exposition that should have just been done another way.

101
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:19,040
Rym: Like I feel like the movie went way out of its way to make sure you understood what the characters were saying.

102
00:08:19,402 --> 00:08:23,820
Rym: Despite ostensibly using this other language to prevent you from understanding what they're saying.

103
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:27,898
Emily: I would have liked it better if it would have been the people.

104
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,300
Emily: There are no human characters that speak English.

105
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,700
Emily: And the only English is spoken by the dogs.

106
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,200
Emily: And so if they need to translate something, it's a voiceover by dogs.

107
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:47,060
Emily: Like there's this one dog who watches TV and she would have been the perfect narrator because they're like, oh, she's the oracle.

108
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,399
Emily: She understands the news.

109
00:08:48,842 --> 00:08:51,519
Emily: But it's just because she can understand human TV.

110
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:58,940
Emily: And so already you've got a built-in plot device for somebody to make that audience connection.

111
00:08:59,322 --> 00:09:03,840
Emily: But instead you had human characters who spoke in Japanese without subtitles.

112
00:09:04,483 --> 00:09:09,000
Emily: But then you had human characters speaking in English with the same language as the dogs are speaking.

113
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:13,880
Emily: And I think the most egregious example of that was the exchange student.

114
00:09:15,145 --> 00:09:17,420
Rym: Who really was that character hadn't been in the movies.

115
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,240
Emily: I thought she was really unnecessary.

116
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:33,319
Emily: And also like as a former exchange student, she made me kind of annoyed because she was like exactly the loud, obnoxious American who was like banging around just like, yeah, everybody listen to me.

117
00:09:33,962 --> 00:09:34,839
Emily: And I'm going to chase her.

118
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:41,340
Rym: I mean, it's very easy to read it that way when she ends up being the de facto leader of the pro dog movement.

119
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:41,736
Emily: Yeah.

120
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,119
Emily: And like you're supposed to empathize with this person and you're like, she is the hero.

121
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,940
Emily: And she actually ends up saving the day in some cases.

122
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:59,200
Emily: And you're like, no, I would have rather had that firm delineation between the humans, you don't understand them.

123
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:01,038
Emily: Or if you speak Japanese, you do.

124
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,475
Emily: But their dialogue and their meaning is mostly told through the actions they do.

125
00:10:08,981 --> 00:10:11,099
Emily: As an animator, it's so easy.

126
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:12,339
Emily: Well, not easy.

127
00:10:12,462 --> 00:10:13,640
Emily: It takes a fair amount of skill.

128
00:10:14,022 --> 00:10:25,020
Emily: But it's not uncommon to have characters who don't speak and act with their physical motions, you know, the whole environmental storytelling aspect.

129
00:10:25,881 --> 00:10:32,960
Emily: You could have conveyed the story with only Japanese dialogue by the humans.

130
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:33,370
Rym: Yep.

131
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,560
Rym: But they don't.

132
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:44,520
Rym: They end up translating almost all of the Japanese in one way or another, even down to the point of using English words that would not normally be used.

133
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:45,657
Emily: Respecto.

134
00:10:46,661 --> 00:10:50,840
Emily: There's this part where the boy, it's a movie about a boy and his dog.

135
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,460
Emily: So there's a lot of interaction between those two characters.

136
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,839
Emily: It's kind of cute that the script is flipped.

137
00:10:56,701 --> 00:11:05,279
Emily: So you have the, at least Western audiences, don't necessarily understand what the human's saying, but they're understanding it from the point of the dog.

138
00:11:05,923 --> 00:11:07,895
Emily: And the boy is like,

139
00:11:08,257 --> 00:11:08,660
Emily: "Sito.".

140
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:15,600
Emily: And in Japanese, there's already "osuwari" is what you'd usually say when you're training your dog.

141
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,220
Emily: Maybe some people say the English word, but that's a little weird.

142
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:40,679
Emily: But I feel like the "fechi" and "sito" and the guy going "respecto" and stuff, it was a little bit unnatural because it's not really... And actually the dialogue itself, even though it was spoken by Japanese actors, it was still kind of stilted.

143
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:48,620
Emily: You know, it was like people would say kind of random things, like ramble on about a war between the dogs and the humans and stuff.

144
00:11:49,764 --> 00:11:50,515
Emily: So I don't know.

145
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:59,437
Emily: That was an idea that could have gone somewhere, but it was definitely kind of ruined.

146
00:12:00,681 --> 00:12:11,540
Rym: There's a lot of those ideas in the movie where individually you could debate their merits, but when they all add up, the movie invited a lot of the criticism that it's getting for this.

147
00:12:12,562 --> 00:12:19,920
Rym: And a lot of it, much of it, not all of it, but much of it could have been easily avoided by just doing simple things like not having the exchange to the character.

148
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,540
Emily: Well, I mean, there were things that go beyond the cultural appropriation debate.

149
00:12:26,023 --> 00:12:33,900
Emily: This is an interesting one because you know when people talk about cultural appropriation on the internet, sometimes I feel like they go a bit overboard.

150
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,860
Emily: I've heard people say being an exchange student is cultural appropriation.

151
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,594
Emily: I'm a little bit like, "Whoa

152
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:39,856
Emily: there!".

153
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:47,140
Emily: I think learning a language but learning it on other people's terms.

154
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:58,659
Emily: Like when I was a foreign student, I definitely understood that I was a guest and I was beholden to other people for allowing me to come study at their school.

155
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:15,059
Emily: Appropriation is more taking something for your own personal gain as a culture that's been empowered by imperialism and basically using it as a very surface level.

156
00:13:17,783 --> 00:13:24,860
Emily: For example, people use the idea of putting a Buddha statue in your home if you're not Buddhist for decoration.

157
00:13:25,683 --> 00:13:34,729
Emily: You don't understand all the cultural background of this object, but you're like, "Oh, it looks cool, so let's roll with

158
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:34,870
Emily: it."

159
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:42,159
Emily: Especially if it comes for your personal gain as in like, "I'm trying to sell this thing.

160
00:13:43,043 --> 00:13:45,940
Emily: I make this food and I borrow from a national cuisine.

161
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,788
Emily: I'm selling it to

162
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:46,951
Emily: you.".

163
00:13:47,780 --> 00:14:00,656
Emily: But this one, I guess at least at the very least, I can say I, as a white American, at least thought they weren't rude about it.

164
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:11,559
Emily: There are some cases where I see people making stuff about Japan and it's just very ignorant and embarrassingly racist.

165
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:25,560
Emily: And this one, I feel like it had the element where it used the aesthetic to dress up the movie and it was kind of surface level, but at least it was respectful about it in a way.

166
00:14:26,621 --> 00:14:35,400
Rym: Yeah, but I guess at the same time, the fact that their almost stated goal was to use Japanese as an unknowable other.

167
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,240
Emily: It was exotic, exactly.

168
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:45,720
Emily: It was like one of those things where they put this overlay on the movie and they could have told the same story in... Somebody used the example of Finland.

169
00:14:45,861 --> 00:14:50,539
Emily: You could have like, "Okay, there's this Finnish dog colony off the

170
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:50,880
Emily: coast.".

171
00:14:51,860 --> 00:15:08,280
Emily: And the Japanese stuff was just there to draw you closer to the dogs and bring you further from the humans and also provide an art style that they could apply to the various look and feel of objects in the film.

172
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:24,260
Emily: And one thing that I did find very interesting, and that brings me to our second point about things that were kind of a little bit dodgy about the movie, is that it's set in future Japan, right?

173
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,089
Emily: But it's not like...

174
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,699
Rym: Yeah, right around the 100 year anniversary of World War II.

175
00:15:28,223 --> 00:15:30,260
Emily: It's not like cyberpunk future Japan.

176
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:48,820
Emily: It bows very heavily from like Showa era aesthetics, like 1930s to 1960s, the art and advertising and graphical style of a lot of things from that era, like World War II to the mid-century.

177
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:57,760
Emily: And that is definitely not accidental because a big part of that movie is about internment.

178
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,418
Emily: It's basically like...

179
00:15:59,721 --> 00:16:06,479
Rym: I mean, they're literally building an internment camp for dogs to use a scapegoat for some other thing and execute them all.

180
00:16:07,184 --> 00:16:11,400
Rym: Yeah, and didn't you say... And then replace them with robots that would then control the population.

181
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,120
Emily: That was kind of a twist.

182
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:13,503
Emily: I was like,

183
00:16:13,585 --> 00:16:13,930
Emily: "Okay.".

184
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:19,397
Rym: It's interesting because that was the only part of the movie that was subtle, was that...

185
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,531
Emily: Was the robot dog?

186
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:25,080
Rym: Only the dog saw the robots acting as these killing machines.

187
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,260
Rym: The normal Japanese people saw them as just cute dog replacements.

188
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:29,618
Emily: They're like Aibo, you know?

189
00:16:29,881 --> 00:16:31,079
Emily: You see those Aibo toys?

190
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:37,860
Rym: So the movie could be so utterly unsubtle and very sort of crude about all of its points.

191
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,620
Rym: And then this one point is the one thing that's easy to miss and subtle and in the background and actually pretty interesting.

192
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:52,659
Emily: You brought up... I didn't even notice some of the things, but they basically... I forget what the gate said, but they basically had the "work will make you free" gate.

193
00:16:54,441 --> 00:16:59,339
Emily: I forget the concentration camp that had that gate, but it was definitely a nod toward that.

194
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:25,414
Emily: I was like, "One, I feel a little... Let's not get into the wartime atrocities of the Japanese empire, but for Americans to throw stones about internment when it comes to Japanese people is a little like, "Okay, let's look at your own

195
00:17:25,474 --> 00:17:25,715
Emily: house.".

196
00:17:26,381 --> 00:17:35,640
Rym: But again, this is one of those situations where all these little elements of the film individually add up to a fairly, not to use the Tumblr word, problematic situation.

197
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,900
Emily: But there were things I really genuinely enjoyed.

198
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,060
Rym: Oh, the movie was beautiful otherwise.

199
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:44,958
Rym: I enjoyed it as much as these things were bothering me.

200
00:17:45,503 --> 00:17:47,220
Emily: And I like the bantery dialogue.

201
00:17:47,761 --> 00:17:48,320
Emily: I gotta admit...

202
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,419
Rym: Well, it was Wes Anderson dialogue.

203
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:50,432
Rym: It was fantastic Mr.

204
00:17:50,493 --> 00:17:51,121
Rym: Fox 2.

205
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:52,840
Emily: I'm a fan of Wes Anderson.

206
00:17:53,441 --> 00:18:03,720
Emily: I really like the Royal Tenenbaums is one I'm not sure if you've seen, but I really like that movie and a bunch of other ones that I've seen, I've actually really enjoyed.

207
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:09,679
Emily: And people rip on him for his little bit pretentious, this hipster aesthetic to it.

208
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,740
Emily: But it had all those points, like the back and forth, mundane dialogue.

209
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:21,159
Emily: It had that deadpan banter that he has going on.

210
00:18:21,922 --> 00:18:23,299
Emily: And the music was really good.

211
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:30,199
Emily: It had the acoustic indie band that was... I really enjoyed the soundtrack.

212
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,900
Rym: A lot of wide shots of the characters traversing across the... Yeah, like doing their montage of traveling to the other side of the island.

213
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:40,040
Emily: So all those things were great.

214
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:47,060
Emily: And like I said, in terms of the animation, it was pretty amazing.

215
00:18:47,302 --> 00:18:48,238
Emily: I loved watching it.

216
00:18:49,401 --> 00:18:55,320
Emily: One thing I will rag on it though, I was pretty mad that they set a dog film in Japan and did not have a Shiba.

217
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,540
Emily: I think there was one Shiba in the background.

218
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,428
Emily: I was like, "What's

219
00:18:58,469 --> 00:18:58,874
Emily: Shiba?".

220
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,617
Emily: That's just 'cause I'm biased, but whatevs.

221
00:19:04,722 --> 00:19:09,158
Emily: And also the whole animal testing subplot, that always really gets to me.

222
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,210
Rym: Yeah, the whole plague dog subplot.

223
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:13,853
Emily: I was just like,

224
00:19:13,874 --> 00:19:13,956
Emily: "No!".

225
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:24,039
Rym: But it also complicates the overall themes in the sense that the dogs just basically want to return to the servile life among humans.

226
00:19:25,522 --> 00:19:32,640
Rym: Who, independent of the Isle of Dogs, like the internment, they had been experimenting on dogs anyway before that point.

227
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,420
Emily: Yeah, it was like pre-banishment of the dogs.

228
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:39,660
Emily: They had been making this... Like there were the dogs who existed before on the island.

229
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,140
Emily: Everybody starts rumors about that.

230
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:42,700
Emily: That scene actually made me cry.

231
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,992
Emily: That was a scene where I was just like,

232
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:44,356
Emily: "No!".

233
00:19:44,841 --> 00:19:47,419
Rym: I mean, again, I appreciate how it didn't shy away from that.

234
00:19:47,702 --> 00:19:50,340
Rym: If it's gonna introduce it, it really went into it.

235
00:19:52,385 --> 00:19:55,500
Emily: It had some good emotional beats to the movie.

236
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:03,680
Emily: And I mean, I do like stories about the bond between an animal and a human and stuff like that.

237
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,260
Emily: So it was definitely a boy and his dog kind of story.

238
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:09,654
Emily: And it was about that love and that bond.

239
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:14,480
Emily: The boy would not give up his dog and the dog would not give up on the boy.

240
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:21,040
Rym: Meanwhile, the primary antagonist in the movie ended up being pretty inscrutable.

241
00:20:23,284 --> 00:20:31,480
Rym: And it was very difficult to understand why the mayor changed his mind and why he did what he did in the first place.

242
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:42,000
Rym: And that was very much obscured behind the fact that this character has no meaningful translated dialogue, except the dialogue that served as exposition for the story that the dogs followed.

243
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,400
Emily: So there were a lot of things.

244
00:20:44,441 --> 00:20:48,540
Emily: And we talked about this, like, is it because they want a hostile takeover?

245
00:20:48,702 --> 00:20:50,020
Emily: Is it about militarization?

246
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:58,040
Rym: I mean, that's kind of partly how I read it at-- - I mean, isn't it 'cause you want to get rid of dogs, replace them with robot dogs who then can control the population if need be?

247
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,899
Emily:  It's about losing the country's soul.

248
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:02,860
Emily: That's what it's about.

249
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:07,379
Emily: It's about militarization of a country and the rise of imperialism.

250
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,420
Rym:  It's about how these government officials are actually secretly crew cats.

251
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,058
Emily:  Are actually cats, yeah.

252
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,740
Rym: See, but that's what I'm saying.

253
00:21:14,283 --> 00:21:16,999
Emily: What is it actually, why did they do this?

254
00:21:17,521 --> 00:21:27,759
Emily: Is it because they just like cats or is it because they're trying to convert the country over-- - Well, there's that lurch-looking vizier, whatever he was.

255
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,918
Rym:  That's what I'm talking about.

256
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,520
Rym:  The guy who looks exactly like an old Lupin villain.

257
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:37,998
Emily:  Yeah, he's like this creepy-ass zombie-looking dude who is major domo.

258
00:21:39,302 --> 00:21:41,516
Emily: He's like the military henchman who's like,

259
00:21:41,657 --> 00:21:42,120
Emily: "Mwahaha.".

260
00:21:44,168 --> 00:21:45,320
Emily: And then there was the scientist.

261
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,120
Emily: That was the other thing that I kept expecting the scientist subplot to go somewhere.

262
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,480
Emily: And that was another joke that felt very flat.

263
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:58,419
Emily: is his sidekick, his assistant, was Yoko Ono.

264
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,920
Emily:  Was that really a joke?

265
00:22:00,962 --> 00:22:04,220
Rym: It was just a cameo that was very unfortunately placed.

266
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,235
Emily:  Yeah, it was just like, "Yoko

267
00:22:06,255 --> 00:22:06,437
Emily: Ono!".

268
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,127
Emily: I was like,

269
00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:07,537
Emily: "Okay.".

270
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,558
Rym:  Like the movie's literally like, "No, her name is literally Yoko

271
00:22:10,578 --> 00:22:10,699
Rym: Ono.".

272
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,973
Emily: And here she is, you know?

273
00:22:12,841 --> 00:22:16,640
Emily: So, I mean, yeah, it was totally a cameo, but it was just a little bit awkward.

274
00:22:16,821 --> 00:22:17,211
Emily: I was like, "Eh,

275
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:17,520
Emily: whatever.".

276
00:22:19,761 --> 00:22:26,999
Rym:  Especially because that character serves no purpose other than to be a stepping stone for the American exchange student girl.

277
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:27,896
Emily:  To save the day.

278
00:22:30,185 --> 00:22:42,060
Emily: You know, that could have been executed, that whole subplot with the scientist and the cure serum could have been executed with the Yoko Ono character.

279
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,760
Rym:  Yeah, it's like they added a white character into the mix just so she could be the hero.

280
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:49,354
Emily:  Yep.

281
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,059
Emily: So anyway, I mean, I can go on and be like what I would have done differently.

282
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:02,080
Emily: And I do still think that I would recommend this movie.

283
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,880
Emily: Like, it's been reviewed pretty highly on Rotten Tomatoes.

284
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,800
Rym:  I will pretend I didn't thoroughly enjoy it.

285
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:30,180
Emily:  It's not without good reason that people have been enjoying this movie, but I would warn American viewers to go into this with that sort of skeptical mindset of, you know, you can enjoy the thing, but also be aware that this is definitely a very Western viewpoint.

286
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:39,595
Emily: You know, don't let the surface level detail of like, "Oh, look, that's written in Japanese fool you into thinking that it's anything

287
00:23:39,898 --> 00:23:40,040
Emily: but.".

288
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:51,640
Emily: So Wes Anderson, you continue your streak of making odd and slightly pretentious cinema, and I hope you make more stop motion.

289
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,339
Rym:  But maybe don't make another one set in Japan right away.

290
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,439
Emily:  Please, that's probably not a good idea to do.

291
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,640
Rym:  But yeah, we avoided like super spoilers or anything, 'cause you should probably go see it at some point.

292
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,017
Emily:  Yeah, like I feel like we didn't cross that line where it's like, "Oh, and then so-and-so shows

293
00:24:09,158 --> 00:24:09,218
Emily: up.".

294
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,720
Rym:  There's a couple of shocking twists and turns along the way that are actually pretty interesting.

295
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,394
Rym:  Yeah, and I did like- - I mean, right in the beginning, "The Cage with the Dead

296
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:18,578
Rym: Dog.".

297
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,792
Emily:  Oh my God, that was, I was like,

298
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:21,174
Emily: "No!".

299
00:24:22,281 --> 00:24:32,055
Emily: But like, it's a disturbing film, but it's disturbing in the way that I like, and it has animal characters triumphing over adversity.

300
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,639
Rym:  Well, the best character in the whole movie is that hacker kid.

301
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:36,789
Emily:  No.

302
00:24:37,362 --> 00:24:38,800
Rym:  That kid was my favorite character.

303
00:24:39,542 --> 00:24:44,300
Emily:  I think I like the plague dog dogs.

304
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,658
Rym:  Oh yeah, they're good.

305
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,540
Emily:  That was good.

306
00:24:46,962 --> 00:24:48,960
Emily: I actually really like the main character.

307
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:57,920
Emily: This is basically, he's like the pack leader, and the other is like the second-in-command dog is always mad about this.

308
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,918
Rym: It's like, "Why are we gonna do what he wants to

309
00:24:59,938 --> 00:24:59,978
Rym: do?".

310
00:25:01,143 --> 00:25:02,420
Emily: It's like an ongoing gag.

311
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,200
Rym:  Yeah, the dogs are really funny, 'cause it's just all-star cast.

312
00:25:06,303 --> 00:25:08,160
Rym: It's like Jeff Goldblum and Bill Murray.

313
00:25:09,001 --> 00:25:14,860
Emily: Did you notice when the American actors are talking, like the voices seem more clear?

314
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:19,080
Rym:  Oh, a bunch of people reviewing it said the same thing.

315
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:26,960
Rym:  No, it sounded like-- - All the Japanese voices were muffled definitely on purpose, 'cause you can't make that kind of mistake as a voice mixer.

316
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,198
Emily:  You know what it felt like?

317
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:35,819
Emily: It felt like they were making the recordings kind of match the visuals, 'cause like I was saying, it has a very antique feel to it.

318
00:25:36,322 --> 00:25:40,360
Emily: It sounds like somebody's talking into a really old microphone or something.

319
00:25:40,621 --> 00:25:57,600
Emily: It's got that same sort of muffled quality of archaic film recording or something like that, and it definitely feels very crudded up, whereas everybody else's voice is just very normal surround sound.

320
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:06,499
Rym:  Yeah, the one interesting, just a frame, the thing that I did like is the way characters were framed when they were talking is they usually wouldn't be shown talking to each other, especially the dogs.

321
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,440
Rym: They'd be shown talking directly at the camera.

322
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:18,360
Rym:  Yeah, but again, that's one of those things where it's like definitely-- - And you get these 180 flips with the camera, but you clearly wouldn't get any panning shots or anything.

323
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:24,018
Emily: You just get-- - It was like a dialogue, and you're inhabiting the two characters talking to each other.

324
00:26:25,201 --> 00:26:29,520
Emily: But stuff like that is very interesting artistically.

325
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:36,059
Emily: I feel like they took certain risks with this movie and the framing of shots.

326
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:44,180
Emily: Like you were saying, the long shots where they're going along and the background is changing, like different shots of all the rubble.

327
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:58,600
Emily: And I gotta say, I'm weird in that I like aesthetically that kind of decayed industrial feeling.

328
00:26:59,722 --> 00:27:04,140
Emily: Pictures of old factories and stuff can be really almost beautiful.

329
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,440
Emily: They're like ugly beautiful.

330
00:27:06,044 --> 00:27:07,219
Emily: And that's what this movie was.

331
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,300
Emily: It was ugly beautiful.

332
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,360
Rym:  So yeah, it's probably worth seeing.

333
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,359
Emily:  Yeah, I'd say go for it.

334
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,799
Rym:  I mean, if you like Wes Anderson stuff, it's just more of that.

335
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,838
Emily:  It's basically Fantastic Mr.

336
00:27:19,878 --> 00:27:27,180
Emily: Fox, but in some respects better, but with an added dose of cultural appropriation.

337
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,095
Rym:  I guess in the end, I partly liked Fantastic Mr.

338
00:27:30,155 --> 00:27:32,336
Rym: Fox more because it was more whimsical.

339
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:35,298
Rym: And while it never really went-- - Way less grim.

340
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,317
Rym:  Yeah, I mean, granted the moral of Fantastic Mr.

341
00:27:39,337 --> 00:27:41,460
Rym: Fox is he's not that fantastic.

342
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,460
Rym: It kind of ruined everything for everybody.

343
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,192
Emily:  But in a way, Fantastic Mr.

344
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:47,700
Emily: Fox had a happy ending.

345
00:27:48,581 --> 00:27:51,300
Emily: And I just saw it like a few months ago.

346
00:27:51,441 --> 00:28:00,560
Emily: So it's relatively fresh in my memory, but there's a lot of things that go on where it's a constant escalation of like predicaments.

347
00:28:01,202 --> 00:28:05,039
Emily: And it's about somebody trying to like fake it till they make it.

348
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,099
Emily: That was basically the motto of that movie.

349
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:13,939
Emily: It's like, say you're an average Joe, just tell yourself you're not and you somehow you'll make it through.

350
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:21,699
Rym:  But Isle of Dogs has its own, the whimsical or weird moments that it has kind of come out of left field.

351
00:28:22,263 --> 00:28:26,819
Rym: And they're lampshaded in the course of the movie, like the exploding teeth thing.

352
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,839
Emily:  Yeah, like it was a very surreal film.

353
00:28:30,702 --> 00:28:33,259
Emily: Like a lot of stuff you'd be like, what is this even?

354
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,240
Emily: And some stuff was just strange.

355
00:28:38,061 --> 00:28:43,534
Emily: And like the whole thing about poison wasabi, I was like, wasabi poison.

356
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,333
Rym:  See again with the Japanese thing, why did it have to be wasabi?

357
00:28:48,374 --> 00:28:49,180
Rym: that is the poison?

358
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,056
Rym:  But the thing is, it wasn't specific.

359
00:28:52,821 --> 00:28:55,379
Emily: I thought they were just gonna use it when they murdered the one guy.

360
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,980
Rym:  But no, that's also the genocide poison for the dogs.

361
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:15,960
Emily:  Yeah, there was like this elaborate, that was a perfect example of how the animation could be beautiful where they show in like pretty realistic detail, a sushi chef preparing these different fish for a bento that's then poisoned, poisoned wasabi.

362
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:25,437
Emily: And so that's why I thought it was wasabi poison, but then wasabi poison is the name of the gas that they're trying to murder the dogs with, so okay.

363
00:29:28,082 --> 00:29:29,999
Emily: So cool, whatevs.

364
00:29:30,847 --> 00:29:31,719
Emily: We'll see how it does.

365
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:42,340
Emily: I'm curious to see when it's released in Japanese theaters, how Japanese film critics react to it because that's something that I've noticed.

366
00:29:42,401 --> 00:30:00,580
Emily: that's kind of interesting because I feel like Asian American viewers often have different reactions to whitewashing or those types of problematic Hollywood habits compared to Japanese audiences.

367
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,589
Emily: Like the whole ghost in the shell thing, a lot of the Japanese people I saw on Twitter were like, "Hey, what

368
00:30:05,735 --> 00:30:05,777
Emily: up?".

369
00:30:06,441 --> 00:30:16,480
Emily: Like they didn't care that much about it, but at the same time, they're coming at it from a different context where they're in the majority where they live.

370
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:20,800
Emily: So don't feel as culturally embattled, I think.

371
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:31,999
Rym: But I guess also like combining that with the whole, it's all male characters and the only female characters who do anything are the white girl.

372
00:30:33,444 --> 00:30:35,000
Rym: I guess that she's the only one who does anything.

373
00:30:35,461 --> 00:30:35,693
Emily: No, no.

374
00:30:36,645 --> 00:30:42,540
Rym: The scientist girl doesn't do anything except tell the white girl what to do and Nutmeg, the dog, doesn't do anything.

375
00:30:42,661 --> 00:30:44,359
Rym: She's just there to be a reward at the end.

376
00:30:44,621 --> 00:30:51,660
Emily: She's there to offer enigmatic advice to doggy protagonist.

377
00:30:53,161 --> 00:31:00,779
Emily: Well, I feel like we ragged on the movie sufficiently, but also said that we liked aspects of it.

378
00:31:01,422 --> 00:31:04,200
Emily: So I don't want to belabor the point.

379
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,177
Rym: Yeah, go see it.

380
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,260
Rym: Make your own determination about Wes Anderson.

381
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,239
Emily: Yes, indeed.

382
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,180
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

383
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:23,300
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

384
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:28,720
Rym: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

385
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,660
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

386
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:36,399
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

387

Rym: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

388
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,180
Rym: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

389
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,360
Rym: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
