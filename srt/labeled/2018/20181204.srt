00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,013
Rym: It's Tuesday, December 4th 2018.

2
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:13,474
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,494 --> 00:00:14,035
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,216 --> 00:00:15,579
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:18,142
Rym: Tonight, Treasure Island.

6
00:00:18,763 --> 00:00:19,244
Scott: Yarr.

7
00:00:20,486 --> 00:00:21,568
Rym: Let's do this.

8
00:00:24,112 --> 00:00:24,432
Scott: Woman.

9
00:00:25,154 --> 00:00:26,276
Rym: Yeah, right?

10
00:00:26,756 --> 00:00:27,578
Scott: Yesterday.

11
00:00:27,698 --> 00:00:28,439
Scott: It is cold.

12
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:31,349
Rym: Yesterday was like 50 something degrees.

13
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,159
Rym: Like on the way home from PAX, like literally.

14
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:36,549
Rym: I brought a winter coat because on Thursday it was cold.

15
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,983
Rym: And then I come home and it's like 60 degrees outside.

16
00:00:40,324 --> 00:00:41,428
Rym: And now it's winter again.

17
00:00:41,448 --> 00:00:44,380
Rym: I feel like winter started like three times already.

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,102
Scott: It's too cold.

19
00:00:45,985 --> 00:00:54,433
Scott: Also, you know, if you have an iPhone 7 and some other numbers, I guess you have until the end of the year to get a new battery for $30 instead of $80.

20
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:57,886
Rym: It's worth it.

21
00:00:57,926 --> 00:01:04,269
Scott: My battery didn't have any problems, but I just went to get a new battery anyway, because all the iPhones are too big.

22
00:01:04,551 --> 00:01:12,118
Scott: So my plan is to make this iPhone 7, which is still perfectly fine and smaller than all new iPhones, last as long as humanly possible.

23
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:14,867
Scott: So I got myself a $30 brand new battery.

24
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:19,504
Rym: A year ago I got the last good Android phone, the Xperia XC1 Compact.

25
00:01:19,764 --> 00:01:21,871
Rym: And the new version of this phone is a piece of shit.

26
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:27,812
Rym: So I bought, because I found one cheap unopened, another one of this phone.

27
00:01:28,796 --> 00:01:32,253
Rym: And when this one starts to get battery shitty, I'm just going to sell it on eBay.

28
00:01:32,273 --> 00:01:35,548
Scott: The only problem is eventually they're going to have 5G networking on the new radios.

29
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:38,259
Rym: The thing is, 4G is already 5 for now.

30
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:38,801
Scott: Well, for now.

31
00:01:38,982 --> 00:01:40,088
Rym: Yeah, I mean, yes, eventually.

32
00:01:40,389 --> 00:01:43,747
Rym: Within like five years, I'm going to have to give up on this Sony phone.

33
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:46,423
Scott: Right, but the point is I'm going to make this phone last as long as possible.

34
00:01:46,443 --> 00:01:47,429
Scott: Are there other notes?

35
00:01:47,529 --> 00:01:48,374
Scott: Just side notes?

36
00:01:48,555 --> 00:01:50,223
Rym: I might have to finally find my new laptop though.

37
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:59,756
Rym: I have a laptop that will have made it 10 years, and there's nothing wrong with it, except mini display port is a failed connector type.

38
00:01:59,937 --> 00:02:07,334
Scott: Yeah, so side notes number one, if you go and get a new battery, the battery they give you is basically empty, so bring with you your Anker battery so you can charge it.

39
00:02:07,354 --> 00:02:10,285
Rym: Oh yeah, otherwise however you get home is going to suck.

40
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:27,672
Scott: Right, and B, you know, you got your iCloud backup or your backup to your hard drive, because basically what happens is if they break your phone, which happened actually to the person next to me, if they break your phone while changing the battery and it wasn't your phone's fault, they just give you a new phone.

41
00:02:27,892 --> 00:02:33,376
Scott: That's the backup, which totally works, because iCloud backup actually works.

42
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:40,725
Scott: I've used it several times, but the one thing that will not be backed up with an iCloud backup is, you know, the way it works.

43
00:02:40,805 --> 00:02:46,677
Scott: is it basically instead of actually saving your apps in the backup, it just remembers which apps you had and where they were on the screen.

44
00:02:46,697 --> 00:02:48,104
Rym: You got to type your password into everything.

45
00:02:48,144 --> 00:02:55,480
Scott: And then it re-downloads them all from the store all at once, and it also saves certain documents and data, like photos, text messages, that sort of thing.

46
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,820
Rym: Androids the same way, when I like, I took the backup from my old phone into this phone.

47
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,906
Rym: It's actually pretty clever.

48
00:03:00,926 --> 00:03:04,282
Scott: It's a good way to back up when you have such a locked in OS.

49
00:03:04,403 --> 00:03:07,155
Rym: Except I had to type my fucking password into like 20 apps once.

50
00:03:07,175 --> 00:03:08,401
Scott: Yes, you have to do that.

51
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:11,440
Scott: I had to do that on my new iPad, which I restored from a backup of the old iPad.

52
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:16,481
Rym: Which was annoying because the password, my generic password is really, really, really long to type.

53
00:03:16,562 --> 00:03:35,237
Scott: One thing, though, is if for some reason you have to get like a new phone and lose the actual data, you and your two-factor authentication app, right, you will be in trouble because you open it and it will not allow you to lock into anything.

54
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:46,573
Scott: Now, make sure you have, if you use 2FA, which you should be using for anything that uses it, proper 2FA, not stupid text message 2FA, make sure you go spend.

55
00:03:46,873 --> 00:03:50,967
Rym: SMS 2FA is actually minus one modifier to how many factors you have.

56
00:03:51,127 --> 00:04:02,417
Scott: I know, but the point is, is that if you're using it extensively, as you should be, make sure to go through, take an hour or two, wherever, and go down your list of all the things you have 2FA for.

57
00:04:02,437 --> 00:04:03,400
Rym: And print your backup codes.

58
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,745
Scott: And print out backup codes.

59
00:04:04,805 --> 00:04:09,247
Rym: Now, this is important because Scott lost a Discord account, because some things, like Amazon.

60
00:04:09,287 --> 00:04:10,573
Scott: The only one I've ever lost.

61
00:04:10,593 --> 00:04:13,670
Rym: Amazon, if you mess it up, like you can do a reset, I think, and like fix it.

62
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,123
Rym: Like most services have a way to like reset it with email.

63
00:04:16,244 --> 00:04:17,028
Scott: This was years ago.

64
00:04:17,088 --> 00:04:22,690
Rym: Yeah, and Google is pretty good because if you get a YubiKey, you can have that and TOTP.

65
00:04:23,312 --> 00:04:27,084
Rym: So I have a YubiKey and my two-factor here and the backup code, so I'm good.

66
00:04:27,525 --> 00:04:30,154
Rym: But Discord does proper security.

67
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:34,569
Rym: If you lose your two-factor and you don't have the backup codes, you are fucked.

68
00:04:35,252 --> 00:04:36,517
Rym: That account is gone.

69
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:40,617
Scott: Yeah, so I lost my Discord account that's associated with my actual email address.

70
00:04:40,657 --> 00:04:42,526
Rym: Is that the one you used to make that old Discord?

71
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:44,657
Scott: I had to use an alias email, I don't know.

72
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:50,158
Scott: I have to use an alias email address in order to, you know, log into Discord now.

73
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:54,000
Scott: It's like when I log into Discord, I got to remember, oh, right, it's not my normal email to log into this.

74
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:54,741
Rym: Yep.

75
00:04:55,223 --> 00:04:59,720
Rym: Also, if you use the GeekNights Forum, I know that we support TOTP, like Google Authenticator.

76
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,302
Rym: It just works.

77
00:05:01,024 --> 00:05:01,647
Rym: You should use it.

78
00:05:01,847 --> 00:05:02,229
Rym: Exciting.

79
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:02,670
Rym: Yeah.

80
00:05:03,453 --> 00:05:12,635
Rym: So my opening bit, and I'll tell the short story because it just is a fascinating thing happened to me, but basically, I need a new monitor because my monitor is also like 10 years old.

81
00:05:12,675 --> 00:05:15,550
Rym: It's like this ancient ultra sharp and I didn't get monitors.

82
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,383
Scott: Your ultra sharp is the same ultra sharp I have two of on my desk.

83
00:05:18,724 --> 00:05:20,169
Scott: It's not ancient, it's perfectly fine.

84
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,916
Rym: Yeah, so it's not enough pixels.

85
00:05:22,297 --> 00:05:24,304
Scott: It's not 4K.

86
00:05:24,364 --> 00:05:25,568
Rym: It's way, it's not, it's 1920 by 1200.

87
00:05:25,568 --> 00:05:25,749
Rym: Yeah.

88
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:29,563
Rym: That's not enough pixels for the Adobe stuff I do.

89
00:05:29,623 --> 00:05:30,407
Scott: It's perfectly fine.

90
00:05:30,608 --> 00:05:31,453
Rym: It's not for Adobe.

91
00:05:31,573 --> 00:05:31,774
Rym: Okay.

92
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:32,559
Rym: Basically, I need...

93
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:33,403
Scott: I've never had a problem.

94
00:05:33,423 --> 00:05:34,951
Rym: The thing is, you don't edit that much.

95
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:41,475
Rym: The only things I need a lot of pixels for are arguably gaming, but not really because like.

96
00:05:41,536 --> 00:05:42,077
Rym: it's fine.

97
00:05:42,077 --> 00:05:48,058
Rym: 1920 by 1200 is fine for Overwatch and Civ or whatever, but I want those pixels for Adobe.

98
00:05:48,078 --> 00:05:53,977
Rym: And also at work, I have like a really nice, like super quality, like 4K, like new monitor.

99
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:58,720
Rym: So I didn't really notice that over time, this old ultra sharp has gotten less and less color correct.

100
00:05:59,101 --> 00:06:02,376
Rym: And also I want to take this one and make it my secondary monitor.

101
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:03,681
Scott: Also, I have two of those.

102
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:03,982
Scott: You have...

103
00:06:04,002 --> 00:06:05,065
Rym: Yes, I have one of those.

104
00:06:05,326 --> 00:06:08,515
Rym: My secondary monitor is Scott's 4x3 LCD monitor.

105
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:16,242
Rym: That was one of the first LCD monitors with a fast enough refresh rate on earth to play games.

106
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,029
Rym: that was affordable by normal humans.

107
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:20,739
Scott: That monitor is from 2000 single digit.

108
00:06:20,859 --> 00:06:20,980
Rym: Yup.

109
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,702
Rym: Like 2002.

110
00:06:21,702 --> 00:06:22,826
Rym: Two-ish.

111
00:06:23,187 --> 00:06:23,909
Scott: Let me go.

112
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:25,896
Scott: Very early and it's still rocking.

113
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,506
Scott: I paid $500 for those monitors and they're totally worth it.

114
00:06:28,547 --> 00:06:29,170
Scott: They kick ass.

115
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:32,105
Rym: So I'm going to replace that with my current ultra sharp.

116
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:33,757
Scott: Kicking ass for almost 20 years, those monitors.

117
00:06:33,817 --> 00:06:36,729
Rym: And I'm going to replace my ultra sharp with a new 4K ultra sharp.

118
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:37,372
Rym: Okay.

119
00:06:37,713 --> 00:06:40,967
Rym: But so I ordered one and like you do, I went to Dell.

120
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:47,160
Rym: I figured out which ultra sharp has like the right color correctness and things that I care about because I don't need the one that costs three times as much.

121
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,605
Rym: That's slightly better colors.

122
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,435
Rym: And I ordered it from Amazon.

123
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:53,403
Rym: So I get the 5% off because of my Amazon card.

124
00:06:54,546 --> 00:07:05,467
Rym: I didn't notice until after I ordered it later that while I got it from Amazon, because I was just clicking through, it was like 150 bucks cheaper than what Dell is selling it for before that discount.

125
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:12,832
Rym: And it was shipped by someone else, not Dell, which is fine because like Amazon's got your back.

126
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:17,455
Rym: So I ordered this thing and it says, yeah, this will arrive like December 24th and I'm not in a hurry.

127
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:22,414
Rym: So yeah, I'll save like multiple hundreds of dollars and just not wait, like not be in a rush.

128
00:07:23,197 --> 00:07:30,437
Rym: So then like a few days later, like four days later, a suspicious package shows up at my house.

129
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,115
Rym: The box is an HP pavilion monitor of the same size as this one.

130
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:38,198
Rym: And sure.

131
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,785
Rym: And even worse, the box has two labels on it.

132
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:44,097
Rym: The monitor box says it weighs like 14 pounds.

133
00:07:44,558 --> 00:07:50,676
Rym: The shipping label says it should weigh like 18 pounds, but then put it on a scale.

134
00:07:51,057 --> 00:07:56,734
Rym: No, but then the shipping label from the actual shipment said it weighed 24 pounds.

135
00:07:57,797 --> 00:07:59,985
Rym: It was from a Turkish name I didn't recognize.

136
00:08:00,908 --> 00:08:05,369
Rym: And even worse, I was like, I was like vaguely suspicious of like, what did my mom like buy me a gift?

137
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:06,315
Rym: Did someone buy me a gift?

138
00:08:06,597 --> 00:08:07,724
Rym: I'm trying to figure out like what this is.

139
00:08:07,744 --> 00:08:09,696
Rym: Did someone just put something in this monitor box?

140
00:08:10,098 --> 00:08:13,632
Rym: So I pick it up and shake it and I hear metal banging against metal and it's pretty heavy.

141
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:18,206
Scott: So we're confident this box contains cellular phones.

142
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:23,741
Rym: So it's not often that like my suspicious signs go off.

143
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:24,986
Rym: So I do the thing.

144
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:28,480
Rym: I take this UPS shipping number and I put it into the UPS site.

145
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:31,292
Rym: To see if it was actually shipped to me and where it was shipped from.

146
00:08:32,256 --> 00:08:36,150
Rym: And it was shipped and it weighs as like the weight was weird, but whatever.

147
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:42,972
Rym: So then I look it up and I figure out that it came from this like Costco wholesale distribution center.

148
00:08:43,976 --> 00:08:49,356
Rym: So I look it up there and I end up actually like getting on a customer service call with them.

149
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:52,085
Rym: And I'm like, did you ship this package to me?

150
00:08:52,507 --> 00:08:53,891
Rym: And can you tell me what is in it?

151
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:58,727
Rym: And what comes back is after many minutes of talking to these people.

152
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,296
Rym: Yes, we shipped that to you.

153
00:09:01,757 --> 00:09:04,387
Rym: We can't tell you anything else about it or what's in it.

154
00:09:05,651 --> 00:09:06,133
Rym: Weird.

155
00:09:06,635 --> 00:09:08,000
Rym: So finally, I'm like, all right, fuck it.

156
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,987
Rym: I'm just going to open it.

157
00:09:10,108 --> 00:09:10,309
Scott: Yeah.

158
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:11,875
Rym: But I did a little bit of due diligence.

159
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:17,091
Rym: I open it and sure enough, there's this HP Pavilion 4K monitor in there.

160
00:09:17,272 --> 00:09:17,673
Scott: Of course.

161
00:09:18,315 --> 00:09:18,736
Scott: Weird.

162
00:09:19,057 --> 00:09:19,418
Scott: Obvious.

163
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:20,120
Rym: Yeah.

164
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:22,774
Rym: But it was shipped naked like it was shipped in the box.

165
00:09:22,814 --> 00:09:27,634
Rym: It was like usually when you buy something like that, the monitor box is in a regular cardboard box.

166
00:09:28,497 --> 00:09:32,572
Rym: And like my mom or like people I know will just use old monitor boxes to ship stuff like, why not?

167
00:09:33,295 --> 00:09:35,143
Rym: So that plot thickens.

168
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:38,980
Rym: So I go and check like, did someone just ship me the wrong fucking monitor?

169
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:46,170
Rym: But no, because the ultra sharp I ordered was supposed to arrive like many weeks from now and sure enough, did not show as delivered.

170
00:09:46,812 --> 00:09:48,317
Rym: So I'm like, all right, weird.

171
00:09:48,498 --> 00:09:49,541
Rym: I'll deal with this later.

172
00:09:49,862 --> 00:09:50,564
Rym: And I go to Pax.

173
00:09:51,447 --> 00:10:04,583
Rym: During Pax, I discover that basically the company, some company did in fact ship this HP Pavilion monitor to me ostensibly by accident and wants me to ship it back.

174
00:10:05,747 --> 00:10:06,790
Rym: So that seems shady.

175
00:10:07,653 --> 00:10:09,278
Rym: So like, I'm just, it seems weird.

176
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:16,888
Rym: So then I go into Amazon to look at the order of my Dell ultra sharp and it says delivered backdated to the day I got the suspicious package.

177
00:10:17,852 --> 00:10:20,703
Rym: So things are starting to line up and I'm assuming scam.

178
00:10:21,185 --> 00:10:22,389
Rym: So I just say, fuck it.

179
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:24,456
Rym: I want to return this Amazon.

180
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:26,182
Rym: They shipped me some bullshit, whatever.

181
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:28,113
Rym: And Amazon, of course, is like, all right, cool.

182
00:10:28,414 --> 00:10:29,380
Rym: Just ship it full refund.

183
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:38,004
Rym: Then the seller that sent me this monitor contacts me independently and says, hey, we made a mistake.

184
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:40,755
Rym: Ship it back to us and we'll ship you the right monitor.

185
00:10:41,217 --> 00:10:46,252
Rym: The shipping label they sent me is very different from the shipping label Amazon gave me.

186
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:49,643
Rym: So even more warning signs.

187
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,895
Rym: So I'm just shipping, shipping it back with the Amazon label.

188
00:10:51,996 --> 00:10:53,284
Scott: Sounds like some scam is going on.

189
00:10:53,304 --> 00:10:53,485
Scott: Yep.

190
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:54,472
Scott: So I assume I'm going to get a refund.

191
00:10:54,492 --> 00:10:56,786
Scott: Someone trying to launder money by moving monitors around.

192
00:10:56,927 --> 00:11:00,526
Rym: So I get the shipping label, I get a refund from Amazon and I'm just shipping this thing back.

193
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:02,420
Rym: I'm actually going to drop it off at the UPS thing tomorrow.

194
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:03,627
Rym: Like everything's fine, whatever.

195
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,468
Rym: I figured there's some scam where they like shipped the wrong monitor and hope you won't notice.

196
00:11:07,508 --> 00:11:08,211
Rym: You're like, I don't know.

197
00:11:09,095 --> 00:11:14,557
Rym: So, uh, the plot thickened because I got home today and Adele ultra sharp is sitting at our house.

198
00:11:14,577 --> 00:11:15,299
Rym: All right.

199
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,203
Rym: From that same Turkish name.

200
00:11:17,223 --> 00:11:20,971
Rym: I don't know how they got it here that fast.

201
00:11:22,194 --> 00:11:26,447
Rym: So I'm going to figure out what to do.

202
00:11:26,587 --> 00:11:32,948
Rym: I'm going to see if this box in fact contains the delta sharp I ordered or what I'm suspecting a bunch of spiders.

203
00:11:33,088 --> 00:11:47,202
Scott: So something similar, not too similar, but happened to me where, uh, I ordered stuff on Amazon and I ordered this glass mixing bowl and I really needed a glass mixing bowl because all the mixing bowls I have for baking are metal.

204
00:11:47,784 --> 00:11:53,044
Scott: and I got a cookie recipe that requires brown in the butter first, which means the butter's going to be hot.

205
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:57,986
Scott: I want to put the hot butter in a metal mixing bowl and hurt myself.

206
00:11:58,086 --> 00:12:00,374
Rym: I have one big glass mixing bowl for similar purposes.

207
00:12:00,755 --> 00:12:05,955
Scott: So I went and bought a cheapo pyrex glass mixing bowl, whatever, you know, nice big one.

208
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:10,291
Rym: Oh, and then someone shipped you a weird box of glass broken in charge.

209
00:12:10,432 --> 00:12:11,355
Scott: I see a message.

210
00:12:11,676 --> 00:12:15,151
Scott: It hasn't shipped yet according to Amazon, but I get an email from FedEx.

211
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:18,105
Scott: It's like, Hey, Sutton's on the way from Ben bath and beyond.

212
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,798
Scott: I have not shot that a bed bath and beyond in a very long time.

213
00:12:20,818 --> 00:12:28,940
Scott: I will not do so because the last time I did, they started spamming me with a bunch of garbage and I don't like them and their store is a mess and I don't know how they still in business.

214
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,501
Scott: Fuck them.

215
00:12:29,521 --> 00:12:33,152
Scott: Uh, but so I'm like opinions, big mood.

216
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:33,614
Scott: Yeah.

217
00:12:33,894 --> 00:12:35,620
Scott: So I'm getting this package.

218
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,993
Scott: I'm like, did someone buy me a gift from bed bath and beyond?

219
00:12:38,034 --> 00:12:40,165
Scott: Just coincidentally, it's close to holiday season.

220
00:12:40,185 --> 00:12:40,908
Scott: What's up with that?

221
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:42,013
Rym: That's the thing.

222
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,464
Rym: It's the modifier of it's near the holiday season.

223
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:46,433
Rym: Random package might just be gifts, right?

224
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:47,076
Scott: So I check.

225
00:12:47,277 --> 00:12:53,102
Scott: I look on Amazon and on the FedEx or the tracking numbers of the glass mixing bowl and the bed bath and beyond.

226
00:12:53,142 --> 00:12:53,343
Scott: Right.

227
00:12:54,065 --> 00:13:01,474
Scott: And the tracking info for them was actually the same, but the numbers, the first four digits of the numbers were shuffled up.

228
00:13:01,494 --> 00:13:03,383
Scott: So I'm like, huh, maybe I learned something today.

229
00:13:03,423 --> 00:13:06,140
Scott: Maybe I learned the first four digits of a tracking number don't matter.

230
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,072
Rym: Actually there was something similar with my monitor situation.

231
00:13:09,153 --> 00:13:10,137
Rym: So right.

232
00:13:10,197 --> 00:13:13,977
Scott: But I checked and I tried to shuffle up the first four digits to another configuration.

233
00:13:13,997 --> 00:13:14,480
Scott: that didn't work.

234
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,146
Scott: Only these two configurations worked.

235
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:17,190
Rym: Now I'm curious.

236
00:13:17,311 --> 00:13:33,847
Scott: But anyway, the point is, is that I basically got, uh, you know, I got shafted because all the place that I bought the glass mixing, the reseller on Amazon basically just found out that the glass mixing bowl was cheaper on bed, bath and beyond.

237
00:13:34,469 --> 00:13:37,901
Scott: So they bought it there and arbitrage me for a few dollars.

238
00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:42,935
Scott: Uh, but it didn't really matter to me because I'd saved the 5% with Amazon.

239
00:13:43,036 --> 00:13:48,946
Scott: It's not like it would have been cheaper for me to go to bed, bath and beyond it, nor would I want to go there because I hate them.

240
00:13:48,966 --> 00:13:54,232
Scott: I just don't like going to stores, but it was, yeah, well, I mean I could have bought it from the bed, bathroom.

241
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:56,162
Scott: on website is the point for cheaper.

242
00:13:56,524 --> 00:13:59,294
Rym: The list price was cheaper, but I mean I total cost.

243
00:13:59,335 --> 00:14:03,552
Rym: At this point I buy like hand soap and conditioner on Amazon.

244
00:14:03,572 --> 00:14:05,078
Rym: Like I don't even want to go to a drug store.

245
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,811
Scott: No, even though Amazon is also evil, at least they don't spam me.

246
00:14:08,871 --> 00:14:13,086
Scott: They're, they're evil to everyone but the customer.

247
00:14:13,648 --> 00:14:19,209
Scott: So I will continue to criticize them for being evil to their employees and everyone else they work with.

248
00:14:19,852 --> 00:14:23,027
Scott: Uh, but I can't not be their customer cause they're too good to the customer.

249
00:14:23,288 --> 00:14:31,565
Rym: So anyway, if you were confused why we're talking about monitors and bed, bath and beyond, uh, because you saw us at PAX Unplugged and wanted to see what this podcast was about.

250
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:32,851
Rym: Welcome to GeekNights.

251
00:14:34,177 --> 00:14:35,824
Rym: So now we're going to talk about PAX Unplugged.

252
00:14:35,884 --> 00:14:36,748
Scott: I told you not to listen.

253
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:37,110
Scott: Yep.

254
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:41,065
Rym: So uh, PAX Unplugged just happened and second PAX Unplugged.

255
00:14:41,386 --> 00:14:46,320
Rym: It was from the perspective of reasonable attendees and ourselves.

256
00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:47,806
Rym: It was a triumph.

257
00:14:47,906 --> 00:14:49,052
Rym: It was a fantastic packs.

258
00:14:49,112 --> 00:14:50,016
Rym: I had a really good time.

259
00:14:50,398 --> 00:14:51,522
Rym: I played a shit ton of games.

260
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:58,668
Rym: The con achieved everything I wanted and uh, I don't know what else I can say other than PAX Unplugged.

261
00:14:58,828 --> 00:15:00,977
Rym: really, really great packs to go to.

262
00:15:00,997 --> 00:15:06,504
Scott: The only problem I can add with PAX Unplugged is that I didn't have enough time there because you know, it ain't four days.

263
00:15:06,825 --> 00:15:09,800
Scott: Yeah, I had, I was missing a lot of time cause like I would go do a panel.

264
00:15:10,081 --> 00:15:15,004
Scott: One of the two panels we did was two hours and then I got prep time before and clean up time after.

265
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:19,723
Scott: And even though going back to the room is just a walk through a skywalk, we don't have to go outside even.

266
00:15:19,743 --> 00:15:22,531
Scott: I did not play as many games as I wanted to play.

267
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:28,614
Rym: You guys, they were only three days, but they went till two am.

268
00:15:28,735 --> 00:15:29,438
Scott: That's also true.

269
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:41,576
Rym: So even if we did like three panels, like we felt like we got all the time we needed to game and then just as packs started coming into midnight, they all went four days or they're packed south where like we're just like we have infinite free time.

270
00:15:41,596 --> 00:15:43,686
Rym: Like PAX South is just got a lot of downtime.

271
00:15:43,726 --> 00:15:44,731
Rym: It's really easy to play games.

272
00:15:45,313 --> 00:15:46,056
Rym: PAX Unplugged.

273
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:49,949
Rym: We did a bunch of panels and it's only three days and it ends at midnight.

274
00:15:51,173 --> 00:15:59,267
Rym: and the lobby gaming situation, I think part of it too, is that back in the day we would all go into lobbies of hotels and continue to game for several hours.

275
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:00,994
Rym: You all went to bed.

276
00:16:01,054 --> 00:16:06,177
Scott: We did not get a lot of pre-packs gaming and also cause it's so close to home on Sunday, we just go home immediately.

277
00:16:06,197 --> 00:16:08,229
Rym: I'm staying the night on Sunday next year.

278
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:09,537
Scott: We don't get Sunday night gaming.

279
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,706
Rym: Yeah, well I got evening gaming.

280
00:16:11,746 --> 00:16:13,071
Rym: You went to bed like a little baby.

281
00:16:13,091 --> 00:16:19,094
Rym: So in fact I played a really good game on a Friday night and we had some beers.

282
00:16:19,315 --> 00:16:32,278
Rym: The Marriott lobby was interesting though because that hotel's lobby is not great for gaming, but it has a bar, but the bar is filled with 50% basic people who aren't even staying at the hotel.

283
00:16:32,298 --> 00:16:34,875
Rym: They're just like in Philly and want to drink in this Marriott bar for some reason.

284
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:38,333
Scott: I actually did not like the hotel, but I will probably book it again next year.

285
00:16:38,353 --> 00:16:39,940
Rym: Because it's connected to the skybridge.

286
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,108
Scott: Cause you don't have to go outside.

287
00:16:41,128 --> 00:16:45,288
Rym: Yup, that is the only reason to stay in that hotel because it had surly staff, surly security.

288
00:16:45,349 --> 00:16:46,091
Scott: It was really big.

289
00:16:46,111 --> 00:16:46,794
Scott: The room was meh.

290
00:16:47,175 --> 00:16:47,517
Rym: And the bar...

291
00:16:48,601 --> 00:16:50,591
Scott: It wasn't a Chai Lai Inn room, but it was meh.

292
00:16:50,832 --> 00:16:51,958
Rym: Like the bar wasn't rowdy.

293
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:57,082
Rym: Like I have no comp... Like there were Pax Hairs gaming at like after midnight next to basic people drinking.

294
00:16:57,804 --> 00:17:04,390
Rym: But what was annoying about it is that the guards are like super surly and there's this weird cavalcade of like drunk people.

295
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:15,786
Rym: Like I don't understand why you go to a hotel bar in Philly to drink at night as opposed to an actual bar because none of these people can use the bathroom in this bar because the bathroom requires a room key that they won't give you if you're not staying in the hotel.

296
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:21,538
Rym: So like all these basic people are like walking past our board game trying to go into this bathroom like all night long.

297
00:17:21,578 --> 00:17:22,762
Rym: It was just a weird situation.

298
00:17:23,386 --> 00:17:30,110
Rym: But the secret is even if you're not staying in Home 2, the other hotel, just go game in Home 2.

299
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:35,052
Rym: It has like no security and has a million big tables in the lobby and basically no one will hassle you.

300
00:17:35,072 --> 00:17:36,220
Rym: It's just like this place to go game.

301
00:17:36,961 --> 00:17:40,554
Rym: And they have free tea and if you're slightly evil you can also get free cereal.

302
00:17:41,236 --> 00:17:41,517
Scott: Okay.

303
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,008
Rym: We were there playing Gamely Games.

304
00:17:44,872 --> 00:17:58,327
Rym: What's funny about Pax Unplugged though is that if you look at all the gamers who went to it and like the feedback people have out in the wild like on Reddit and the Penny Arcade forums, it seems like there's three kinds of people talking about Pax Unplugged.

305
00:17:58,689 --> 00:17:59,773
Rym: And what's interesting is that...

306
00:17:59,793 --> 00:18:01,380
Scott: I think it's more than three kinds.

307
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,025
Rym: There's three main kinds.

308
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:10,009
Rym: I would say the three main kinds are people who are used to Paxes who go to Pax Unplugged because it's another Pax.

309
00:18:10,912 --> 00:18:20,190
Rym: The people who are used to shitty board game cons like Gen Con who expected Pax Unplugged to be like Gen Con and thus it wasn't because it's better and now they're mad about it.

310
00:18:21,154 --> 00:18:26,721
Rym: And the people who really don't go to cons at all and this is their first gaming con because it's the first one that's near them.

311
00:18:26,741 --> 00:18:27,203
Rym: that's big.

312
00:18:28,005 --> 00:18:34,570
Rym: And those three groups have a lot of disagreement over what attributes would make a board gaming con successful.

313
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:39,992
Scott: There's definitely a clash of cultures at Pax Unplugged that unlike what is at the other Paxes.

314
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:45,114
Scott: The other Paxes, it's like the cultures don't clash as much because A, they're sort of separated.

315
00:18:45,214 --> 00:18:48,570
Rym: Yep, like these streamer kids literally don't interact with the table toppers.

316
00:18:48,651 --> 00:18:50,339
Scott: Like they're separated by space, right?

317
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:52,447
Scott: It's like those swag hunting people.

318
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,956
Scott: They're in this giant expo hall, right?

319
00:18:54,976 --> 00:18:58,409
Scott: They don't come into the tabletop zone too much, right?

320
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,096
Scott: You're not seeing them, right?

321
00:19:00,257 --> 00:19:02,366
Scott: And then the tabletop people are in the tabletop zone.

322
00:19:02,386 --> 00:19:07,105
Scott: It's like you're not interacting with these other people even though they're also there.

323
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:12,184
Rym: Also both of those groups get what they wanted and are happy and go away, right?

324
00:19:12,364 --> 00:19:18,004
Scott: But at Pax Unplugged, you have in this one giant free, everyone's there for tabletop.

325
00:19:18,105 --> 00:19:19,049
Scott: It's all tabletop.

326
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:20,818
Scott: This is one giant free play space.

327
00:19:20,878 --> 00:19:36,971
Scott: And in that replay space you have the same, you know, grog nard from Gen Con, you know, new board gamer type person who's, you know, fresh, you know, you know, Pax people all in the same place, all buying the same cookie brigade cookie.

328
00:19:36,991 --> 00:19:42,321
Rym: So like literally, there are people, like we show up, we're like, okay, panels, like you see the Pax people, they know the drill.

329
00:19:42,342 --> 00:19:45,080
Rym: Like they go to the keynote and the Q&A and they go to a panel and play the games.

330
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:48,632
Rym: And then you see the fresh people who are like, panels?

331
00:19:48,673 --> 00:19:49,576
Rym: Like what's a panel?

332
00:19:49,616 --> 00:19:51,383
Rym: What's going on?

333
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:52,587
Rym: What are these things?

334
00:19:52,768 --> 00:19:54,073
Rym: I just want to buy board games.

335
00:19:54,414 --> 00:19:54,695
Rym: What?

336
00:19:55,438 --> 00:19:58,193
Rym: And then the Gen Con people are like, how come I have to wait in a line?

337
00:19:58,234 --> 00:20:00,384
Rym: Why couldn't I buy a ticket to this panel in advance?

338
00:20:01,147 --> 00:20:03,234
Scott: Because money doesn't get you anything at Pax.

339
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:05,322
Scott: It's egalitarian Pax.

340
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:06,626
Scott: Deal with it.

341
00:20:06,987 --> 00:20:12,885
Rym: I think the Pax culture is going to win out in the end because that is because it's Pax.

342
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:20,872
Rym: But also because I think it is the superior experience and the people who disagree are welcome to go to Gen Con instead.

343
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:23,565
Scott: Well, they go to Gen Con, they already go to Gen Con.

344
00:20:23,605 --> 00:20:26,118
Scott: They want more Gen Con because there's only one Gen Con a year.

345
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:26,802
Rym: Well, you know what?

346
00:20:26,842 --> 00:20:29,235
Rym: Maybe if Gen Con was better, there could be more than one Gen Con.

347
00:20:29,697 --> 00:20:31,465
Scott: I mean, they, you know, there is.

348
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:33,436
Scott: there is some other Gen Con type stuff.

349
00:20:33,456 --> 00:20:35,044
Scott: There's like, isn't there European Gen Con?

350
00:20:35,084 --> 00:20:36,208
Scott: or there was at one point?

351
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,464
Rym: Or like, there's also those like, regular tabletop gaming cons.

352
00:20:40,484 --> 00:20:42,333
Scott: There are many Gen Con-like cons.

353
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:44,222
Rym: I mean, UberCon was like that, just small.

354
00:20:44,403 --> 00:20:49,569
Scott: And it's, you know, it's also, it's mostly like the RPG people are used to having like schedules and things arranged.

355
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,112
Scott: Yeah.

356
00:20:50,413 --> 00:20:52,746
Rym: You know, but it's like, they're not used to coming to a con and be like, what?

357
00:20:52,766 --> 00:20:54,817
Rym: Just show up and like try to get into a game?

358
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:54,918
Rym: What?

359
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:59,958
Rym: My whole weekend is dependent upon playing this one particular D&D scenario.

360
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:01,686
Rym: And if I don't know in advance, I can do that.

361
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:02,450
Rym: I don't want to go.

362
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,805
Rym: Like, I would rather that culture never interact with PAX.

363
00:21:06,107 --> 00:21:06,267
Scott: Yep.

364
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:07,010
Scott: Anyway.

365
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:08,275
Rym: But yeah, it was a good time.

366
00:21:08,978 --> 00:21:14,696
Rym: So in some other gaming news, Fortnite and Epic are doing something interesting.

367
00:21:14,957 --> 00:21:17,766
Rym: They're basically pulling the Valve 2.0.

368
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:18,007
Scott: Right.

369
00:21:18,047 --> 00:21:23,206
Scott: So, you know, way back in the day, Steam was created and I have a Steam account that is as old as Steam.

370
00:21:23,347 --> 00:21:26,100
Rym: My Steam account is like three days younger than Scott's.

371
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,246
Scott: Go look at my Steam account.

372
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,594
Scott: Anyone can see my Steam profile.

373
00:21:28,614 --> 00:21:33,753
Scott: You'll see that it says that it was created on a day in 2000 something.

374
00:21:33,853 --> 00:21:34,695
Rym: So Scott, why?

375
00:21:34,756 --> 00:21:38,348
Scott: If you go to Wikipedia, you'll see that Steam was launched on that very same day.

376
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:43,993
Rym: So Scott, why did you install Steam in an era when there were literally no games to download on Steam?

377
00:21:44,034 --> 00:21:45,942
Scott: Because there were games to download.

378
00:21:46,103 --> 00:21:52,190
Scott: In that year, the early 2000s, everyone was playing the very important game that is still around called Counter-Strike.

379
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:58,718
Scott: And if Counter-Strike released an update, what you had to do every time Counter-Strike updated, which was several frequently.

380
00:21:58,738 --> 00:21:58,798
Scott: Yep.

381
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,991
Rym: Like at least once a quarter at RIT, sometimes twice.

382
00:22:02,011 --> 00:22:06,788
Scott: You had to go to counter-strike.net, click on downloads, hope the site was live.

383
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:13,614
Scott: There would be a list of mirrors and you had to click on all of those mirrors in your browser that did not yet have tabs.

384
00:22:13,635 --> 00:22:13,976
Scott: Yep.

385
00:22:14,357 --> 00:22:15,783
Scott: The tab browsing was not a thing.

386
00:22:16,365 --> 00:22:21,544
Scott: And all those windows like file zone and two cows and all these different file hosting sites.

387
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:28,476
Scott: You had to find one that was still live because they were all being pummeled by people trying to get the latest version of Counter-Strike.

388
00:22:28,496 --> 00:22:35,545
Rym: And even though we were in RIT and had like two OC3 connections to the internet, which back then was more bandwidth than God.

389
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:39,263
Scott: We weren't limited on our end, we were limited by these file hosts that were down.

390
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:45,366
Rym: We were also limited by the fact that at RIT, there were what, like 12,000 students?

391
00:22:45,366 --> 00:22:48,357
Rym: 11,500 of them were trying to download this file simultaneously.

392
00:22:48,457 --> 00:22:52,039
Scott: If you got the file though, you could share it directly with your friends because it was the era of P2P.

393
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:53,748
Rym: Yeah, but fuck you, I'm playing immediately.

394
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:55,960
Rym: I'm not uploading a file to the drive connect.

395
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,289
Scott: I could put it in my hotline folder and then run it.

396
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,615
Rym: Oh right, your hotline.

397
00:23:00,056 --> 00:23:00,418
Scott: Anyway.

398
00:23:00,438 --> 00:23:02,685
Rym: That also had the Trygun fan subs.

399
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:08,707
Scott: Yes, anyway, the point is you could go and that was how you got Counter-Strike updates.

400
00:23:08,727 --> 00:23:08,909
Scott: It sucked.

401
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,016
Scott: It was a giant pain in the ass.

402
00:23:10,177 --> 00:23:10,961
Scott: Steam was like.

403
00:23:11,142 --> 00:23:13,435
Scott: alright, we're putting up Steam, why are they putting up Steam?

404
00:23:13,637 --> 00:23:15,266
Scott: Why did they make this thing Steam?

405
00:23:15,306 --> 00:23:17,378
Scott: It didn't have friends, it didn't have any of the other stuff.

406
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:25,304
Scott: It was just a way for you to automatically install and update your Valve games without having to buy a-.

407
00:23:25,344 --> 00:23:26,749
Rym: Well, you said buy your Valve games.

408
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:30,706
Rym: It was a way to update Counter-Strike for pretty much everyone who used it.

409
00:23:30,726 --> 00:23:31,369
Scott: Also Half-Life 1.

410
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:36,990
Scott: Yeah, but even by then Half-Life- Half-Life 1 things, like Half-Life 1 whatever.

411
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,437
Rym: No one was playing like- Day of Defeat.

412
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:41,624
Rym: Yeah, whatever.

413
00:23:41,865 --> 00:23:42,508
Scott: Whatever, anyway.

414
00:23:42,528 --> 00:23:46,262
Rym: In those early days of Steam, 99.9% of people were playing Counter-Strike.

415
00:23:46,282 --> 00:23:53,515
Scott: It was also replacing WAN, the World Opponent Network, which was if you wanted to play Counter-Strike, you had to like find servers.

416
00:23:53,555 --> 00:23:56,267
Scott: You'd bring up this window to browse for servers to join.

417
00:23:56,327 --> 00:23:56,628
Scott: Yup.

418
00:23:56,749 --> 00:24:00,403
Scott: And that was run by Sierra/WAN, the World Opponent Network.

419
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:00,926
Scott: Right?

420
00:24:00,946 --> 00:24:03,921
Scott: If you look at the original box for Half-Life 1, it has a Sierra logo on it.

421
00:24:03,941 --> 00:24:06,952
Rym: That's the same logo that's on like Quest for Glory.

422
00:24:07,052 --> 00:24:07,554
Scott: That's right.

423
00:24:08,337 --> 00:24:10,445
Scott: But Steam was also replacing that.

424
00:24:10,606 --> 00:24:19,139
Scott: Valve was running their own servers and their own, at some point, to browse, you know, their own lobby servers to find Counter-Strike servers.

425
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:40,976
Rym: The point is we're old, but the other point is that because Valve made Steam and Steam was the way to update pretty much the most played PC game on Earth at the time, it meant that when Valve wanted to just make the store to sell games and turn Steam into that store, they had the guaranteed built-in audience and it was guaranteed to succeed.

426
00:24:41,056 --> 00:24:50,274
Scott: Yes, Steam added all those features like friend chat and a store as they went on and it became To Conquer the World, it is now basically the PC game store.

427
00:24:50,635 --> 00:24:55,356
Scott: Many other companies have been like, "Damn it, I want to sell PC games, so I don't want to give Valve some of my

428
00:24:55,417 --> 00:24:55,778
Scott: monies."

429
00:24:56,381 --> 00:24:56,622
Scott: Right?

430
00:24:56,642 --> 00:24:57,766
Scott: "So I'm going to make my own

431
00:24:57,847 --> 00:24:58,148
Scott: store.".

432
00:24:58,188 --> 00:25:02,142
Scott: There's a Ubisoft store, there's an EA origin store.

433
00:25:02,162 --> 00:25:02,222
Rym: Yup.

434
00:25:02,242 --> 00:25:04,311
Rym: You all know how well those stores worked.

435
00:25:04,332 --> 00:25:10,217
Scott: There's all these competing stores because they don't want to give Valve a cut and all those stores have not done well.

436
00:25:10,478 --> 00:25:10,860
Rym: Yup.

437
00:25:11,081 --> 00:25:12,630
Scott: They had not dominated the scene.

438
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:18,719
Scott: Sometimes you install one of them just because it's a game you want to play, but you don't actually buy anything else in that store.

439
00:25:18,739 --> 00:25:25,050
Rym: More than once in my life, I have re-bought a game I already owned on Steam just because it was easier than dealing with the old store.

440
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:30,497
Scott: You use the Steam store, all those other things, except for the battle net one maybe because you have to, right?

441
00:25:30,517 --> 00:25:36,142
Scott: It's like they're just launchers for a specific subset of games that are not on Steam and all the other games you buy on Steam.

442
00:25:36,965 --> 00:25:43,711
Scott: But today, the Fortnite people, Epic, the people who also make the Unreal engine, are like, "Hey, we got Fortnite.

443
00:25:43,972 --> 00:25:44,835
Scott: We'll make a fucking

444
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:45,296
Scott: store.".

445
00:25:45,317 --> 00:25:45,939
Scott: Right?

446
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:48,789
Scott: We don't want to give Valve or whoever a cut of our Fortnite monies.

447
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,596
Rym: We're number one.

448
00:25:50,797 --> 00:25:52,586
Rym: And also, Valve takes a huge cut.

449
00:25:52,606 --> 00:25:54,416
Rym: We'll just take away less of a cut because fuck it.

450
00:25:54,597 --> 00:25:59,971
Scott: Right, they're like, "Alright, not only are we going to make our own store for Fortnite, but you know what, you want to sell your games on the Fortnite store?

451
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:03,550
Scott: The thing that people probably have installed just as much as they have Steam

452
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,073
Scott: installed?".

453
00:26:04,093 --> 00:26:05,581
Rym: More people are probably playing Fortnite.

454
00:26:05,601 --> 00:26:07,271
Scott: "We will take less of your money than Valve will

455
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:07,513
Scott: take.".

456
00:26:07,593 --> 00:26:12,794
Rym: More humans are probably playing Fortnite right now than have ever played Counter-Strike.

457
00:26:13,095 --> 00:26:13,356
Rym: Maybe.

458
00:26:13,757 --> 00:26:23,171
Rym: Like, Fortnite is the Counter-Strike of this era, which means that Epic gets to be the Valve of this era starting from a clean slate if they want to be.

459
00:26:23,312 --> 00:26:27,734
Scott: If they can get enough people to sell their non-Fortnite games on the Epic Fortnite store...

460
00:26:27,815 --> 00:26:29,383
Rym: I would put them on the Epic store if I had a game.

461
00:26:29,585 --> 00:26:31,616
Scott: Yeah, if I had a game, why wouldn't I put it on that store?

462
00:26:31,838 --> 00:26:36,903
Rym: Plus, I'd get access to a fresh audience, not these old Counter-Strike nerds who bitch about everything, like Hank, Jim, and Scott.

463
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:41,139
Scott: The point is, is that Valve has also done something.

464
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:45,480
Scott: They said, "Alright, we realize our cut, which is a flat percentage, is too big if your game is too

465
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,043
Scott: big.".

466
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:56,714
Scott: If you have a small game on Steam and they take this percentage, it's like, "Alright, you've got to give Valve enough money to pay for the services they're providing you, like delivering your files to everyone who buys your game and handling all the

467
00:26:56,754 --> 00:26:56,975
Scott: monies.".

468
00:26:57,035 --> 00:27:00,007
Scott: It's only fair that you give them some money.

469
00:27:00,247 --> 00:27:01,332
Scott: They're doing all the shit for you.

470
00:27:02,657 --> 00:27:14,705
Scott: But, if you have a big, big, big popular game on Steam, that percentage cut, even though it's a small percentage, comes out to an enormous amount of money, which is way worth, way more than the services Valve is providing you.

471
00:27:15,046 --> 00:27:17,236
Scott: So they said, "Alright, we've got a new deal on Steam.

472
00:27:17,618 --> 00:27:20,128
Scott: If your game gets real big, we will shrink the

473
00:27:20,168 --> 00:27:20,429
Scott: cut."

474
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:26,758
Scott: Sort of like how if you're a retail store and you order more product from a wholesaler, you know, they give you a better deal.

475
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:29,127
Rym: So what this means, I think, is a couple of things.

476
00:27:29,388 --> 00:27:33,021
Rym: One, it means that Valve's Monopoly days are numbered.

477
00:27:33,502 --> 00:27:35,827
Scott: Yeah, you feel like nothing can be affronted.

478
00:27:35,847 --> 00:27:42,203
Scott: Myspace died, tons of Google things have died.

479
00:27:42,223 --> 00:27:43,989
Rym: Someday Amazon will die.

480
00:27:44,089 --> 00:27:44,992
Scott: All things die.

481
00:27:45,052 --> 00:27:46,637
Scott: Facebook is vulnerable.

482
00:27:46,657 --> 00:27:48,885
Scott: Even Steam is vulnerable.

483
00:27:48,905 --> 00:27:56,373
Scott: I still will go buy things on Steam before I buy them anywhere else because Steam has been around as long as I've made that account.

484
00:27:56,494 --> 00:27:58,582
Rym: I own so many fucking games on Steam.

485
00:27:58,602 --> 00:28:07,920
Scott: Steam has been around since before browsers had tabs, basically, but meanwhile you go to, like, say, the Nintendo Wii shop is gonna die, like, early next year, right?

486
00:28:08,481 --> 00:28:15,227
Scott: So that is why, if there's a game that is on Switch and Steam, I almost always buy the Steam one and not the Switch one.

487
00:28:15,348 --> 00:28:15,890
Rym: My Oculus.

488
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,542
Rym: Oculus has its own store, built in, real easy to use.

489
00:28:18,562 --> 00:28:20,292
Scott: Can't you also buy Oculus games on Steam, though?

490
00:28:20,312 --> 00:28:24,995
Rym: Yes, I buy all my games on Steam and I go into the Steam launcher instead of the Oculus launcher.

491
00:28:25,056 --> 00:28:30,300
Scott: I trust that Steam, even if it is affronted by the Epic store, will continue to exist for a very long time.

492
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,186
Rym: So here's what I predict is gonna happen.

493
00:28:32,548 --> 00:28:40,698
Rym: There is now going to be a real competition on how much of a cut the stores take and how many features the stores provide.

494
00:28:40,739 --> 00:28:42,223
Scott: Great for game developers.

495
00:28:42,585 --> 00:28:44,711
Scott: Great for game players and customers.

496
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:47,680
Scott: It's only bad for Valve and Epic.

497
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,588
Rym: When I say the features...

498
00:28:49,608 --> 00:28:50,914
Scott: They're going from zero to money.

499
00:28:51,115 --> 00:29:00,965
Rym: But when I say the features that the stores provide, I don't mean to you and me, they don't give a shit about us, I mean to the developers, because it sucks ass to put a game up on Steam because they knew they didn't have to help you.

500
00:29:01,447 --> 00:29:06,387
Rym: Now, the stores are going to compete for the attention of the developers.

501
00:29:06,407 --> 00:29:10,068
Scott: They're going to try to get exclusives, like please put your game on the Steam and not on the Epic.

502
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:18,793
Rym: Or they're going to reduce friction to make it real easy to manage your game on their platform and deploy it to the platform to make it more likely for more developers to use the platform out of convenience.

503
00:29:19,014 --> 00:29:25,949
Scott: Much like consoles, they're going to be not only trying to get exclusives, but both of the companies that own stores are also developers, right?

504
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,541
Rym: Oh, that's the other thing, they're going to start making games again.

505
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:31,529
Scott: Right, Fortnite will fade, right?

506
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:35,840
Scott: Artifact hasn't really done great, as predicted.

507
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,057
Rym: You know what this means, Valve might actually have to make fucking Half-Life 3.

508
00:29:40,057 --> 00:29:55,057
Scott: These companies, you can expect as Fortnite fades, and Valve, as all of their games fade, they are going to have to develop games to make their stores things that people must install, right?

509
00:29:55,779 --> 00:30:02,530
Scott: Also expect Blizzard Activision, you know, they already got, what's the friggin' Destiny, whatever in their store there, in the Battle.net client.

510
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:07,910
Scott: You can expect them to maybe be trying to load up that client with other stuff, right?

511
00:30:08,311 --> 00:30:08,573
Scott: Yup.

512
00:30:08,813 --> 00:30:18,166
Rym: So, stay tuned, this is all good news for us, and I mean, most people in the old days, like when we were young, they'd be like, "Oh, Counter-Strike will be the top game

513
00:30:18,206 --> 00:30:18,528
Rym: forever.".

514
00:30:18,548 --> 00:30:20,920
Rym: And it was, until pretty recently, actually.

515
00:30:21,241 --> 00:30:23,108
Scott: You'll know that it's a real thing.

516
00:30:23,128 --> 00:30:28,578
Scott: when I have to install the Epic Store to install something, I won't install Fortnite, but there might be something else I need it for.

517
00:30:28,598 --> 00:30:43,512
Rym: We did a panel in like 2010 or 2011, I still have a screenshot of it, I took a screenshot of the current simultaneous players of the top ten games on Steam, and it was literally, number one was Counter-Strike Source, number two was Counter-Strike 1.6.

518
00:30:43,512 --> 00:30:43,732
Rym: Yup.

519
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:58,242
Rym: So, everyone who complains about Fortnite because you're old like us, listen, Fortnite is Counter-Strike, everything cycles, everything that's old is new, this is the same thing happening all over again.

520
00:30:58,262 --> 00:31:06,932
Scott: The question is, even though Fortnite is obviously huge, right, will it last as long as Counter-Strike has lasted, or will it, at some point, go

521
00:31:07,193 --> 00:31:07,715
Scott: "DING!"?

522
00:31:08,177 --> 00:31:16,790
Rym: Or will it be that the cycle of this will just be faster, because in the old days, it took a long time for anyone to even try to compete with Counter-Strike.

523
00:31:17,111 --> 00:31:21,433
Rym: Meanwhile, we had like, PUBG and Fortnite are out like within hours of each other, effectively.

524
00:31:21,453 --> 00:31:21,835
Scott: Well, PUBG went

525
00:31:21,935 --> 00:31:22,176
Scott: "EEEW!".

526
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:27,059
Scott: It's not, obviously there's still plenty of people playing PUBG, but it sort of did not win its win them battle.

527
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,192
Rym: No, PUBG won a battle to lose the war.

528
00:31:31,794 --> 00:31:52,330
Rym: It'll be its initial experience, and even though I prefer it, I'm not going to complain about Fortnite, because Fortnite is very accessible and is going to really deliver, Fortnite is doing to PC gaming and cross-platform play, and when I say cross-platform, I mean like, on a PC, or on a Switch, or on a tablet, or on a phone, who gives a shit, just games everywhere.

529
00:31:52,893 --> 00:31:59,657
Rym: It's going to do to the modern space what Counter-Strike did to earlier PC gaming, what Quake 2 did to even earlier PC gaming.

530
00:31:59,677 --> 00:32:01,302
Rym: It's all good news.

531
00:32:02,206 --> 00:32:06,060
Rym: Of course, also, if you're not aware, Smash is coming out on the Switch.

532
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,443
Scott: The new Smash is going to be out this Friday, so if you're wondering, you know, you want to let me Smash?

533
00:32:11,865 --> 00:32:13,311
Rym: I'll let you Smash.

534
00:32:13,733 --> 00:32:14,416
Scott: You want to let me Smash?

535
00:32:14,456 --> 00:32:15,440
Scott: You can Smash on Friday.

536
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:16,464
Rym: I'm going to Smash.

537
00:32:16,484 --> 00:32:20,604
Scott: So get ready, because your holidays and your MAGFest are going to be full of smashing.

538
00:32:20,804 --> 00:32:21,025
Rym: Yup.

539
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:31,289
Rym: The only worry I have is that the local wireless multiplayer, I assume, will just not work at all, because Nintendo has never gotten that to work ever on any platform they've ever delivered.

540
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,058
Scott: And I'm not paying for the online service?

541
00:32:33,139 --> 00:32:33,360
Scott: Nope.

542
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:38,460
Scott: So it's going to be local, one Switch multiplayer with a bunch of controllers, as per usual.

543
00:32:38,721 --> 00:32:38,962
Scott: Yup.

544
00:32:39,002 --> 00:32:39,825
Scott: At least they're wireless.

545
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:44,360
Rym: And of course, Rastakhan's Rumbles just came out in Hearthstone.

546
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,471
Scott: Yup, a new Hearthstone expansion came out today.

547
00:32:47,731 --> 00:32:50,040
Scott: Like, it's out right now as I speak.

548
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,463
Scott: When I get home, that's probably what I'm going to do.

549
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:59,100
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

550
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:06,079
Rym: So Emily shared this video with me, and it's a stream of some people playing VRChat.

551
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:11,675
Rym: If you're not familiar, VRChat is kind of fascinating.

552
00:33:12,076 --> 00:33:12,738
Rym: It's basically...

553
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:15,587
Scott: Is it just people who put on VR things just to chat in VR?

554
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:23,878
Rym: But it also has a desktop client, and it is basically the cyberspace that we all wanted in the 90s, but it kind of just exists today.

555
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:27,974
Rym: People just interact in this space, and it's a whole thing on its own.

556
00:33:28,014 --> 00:33:30,525
Rym: But in this space, people have also made these games.

557
00:33:31,188 --> 00:33:33,680
Rym: You can just play these kind of low-rent games with a lot of people.

558
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:44,355
Rym: And because most of the people who are using it do have VR rigs, because you're capturing all their motion, it's pretty immersive and pretty interesting.

559
00:33:44,777 --> 00:33:50,722
Rym: This is something that if you have kids, they are in this thing, even if you don't own VR, and you probably don't even realize it.

560
00:33:50,803 --> 00:33:51,585
Rym: It's real big.

561
00:33:52,287 --> 00:33:57,402
Rym: But this video is a stream with this kid and this guy.

562
00:33:57,442 --> 00:34:00,436
Rym: I don't know if it's an older brother or a dad, but the kid's name is Jordan.

563
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:06,220
Rym: And the kid has been living in VRChat, and this older person is like, "Let me play with you.

564
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:10,614
Rym: I'll come in there, and I'm going to record us playing, and we'll see how it

565
00:34:10,655 --> 00:34:10,976
Rym: goes.".

566
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:24,137
Rym: And this kid is basically Catbug in real life, and this kid is just too cute and too innocent for the terrifying world of VRChat, let alone the evil realities of a cruel Earth.

567
00:34:24,818 --> 00:34:26,705
Rym: And this is so cute to watch.

568
00:34:28,231 --> 00:34:29,636
Rym: He's like, "Okay, here's what we're going to

569
00:34:29,677 --> 00:34:29,797
Rym: do.".

570
00:34:29,837 --> 00:34:32,030
Rym: And the older guy's like, "All right, Jordan, tell me what to

571
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:32,130
Rym: do.".

572
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,400
Rym: And he's like, "So first you take this

573
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:33,762
Rym: bomb.".

574
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:34,545
Rym: He's like, "Whoa, bomb.

575
00:34:34,587 --> 00:34:35,291
Rym: Okay, whatever, let's

576
00:34:35,311 --> 00:34:35,512
Rym: go.".

577
00:34:35,713 --> 00:34:36,920
Rym: He's like, "And you run up here.

578
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,143
Rym: Okay, Jordan, what do you

579
00:34:38,164 --> 00:34:38,304
Rym: do?".

580
00:34:38,687 --> 00:34:41,458
Rym: Then you huck it over the edge, and then it explodes.

581
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,984
Rym: And he's like, "Maybe I killed

582
00:34:43,024 --> 00:34:43,385
Rym: someone.".

583
00:34:43,425 --> 00:34:45,230
Rym: And the dad's just like, "Whoa,

584
00:34:45,831 --> 00:34:46,373
Rym: okay.".

585
00:34:47,536 --> 00:34:48,639
Rym: It's so cute.

586
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,149
Rym: You gotta watch this.

587
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:53,317
Rym: Yeah, seriously, this kid is just Catbug in real life.

588
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:58,237
Rym: The kid's going to be a famous streamer someday, I think, because of this video.

589
00:34:58,257 --> 00:34:58,860
Scott: So, check this out.

590
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,960
Scott: There's apparently some movie called The Art of Rhyme, or maybe a documentary or something.

591
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,704
Scott: I've never seen it.

592
00:35:03,985 --> 00:35:09,811
Scott: I've only seen this clip, this one minute and forty second clip that was posted on YouTube, because a coworker shared it on Slack.

593
00:35:10,614 --> 00:35:16,069
Scott: And this is video footage from Bed-Stuy neighborhood in Brooklyn.

594
00:35:16,711 --> 00:35:20,782
Scott: And in this video is the long-deceased Notorious B.I.G.

595
00:35:21,484 --> 00:35:22,988
Scott: freestyling like, "Oh,

596
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,389
Scott: snap.".

597
00:35:23,509 --> 00:35:25,696
Scott: And he's only seventeen years old.

598
00:35:25,836 --> 00:35:26,357
Rym: Oh, damn.

599
00:35:26,377 --> 00:35:37,812
Scott: So you can see, in case you are too young to know about Biggie, now you can know, like going back and watching, you know, Michael Jordan dunk or whatever.

600
00:35:38,715 --> 00:35:41,565
Scott: You can see why he was so talented and why he is so missed.

601
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,010
Rym: Wow, look at this.

602
00:35:43,653 --> 00:35:45,660
Rym: That video, this video gives me life.

603
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,506
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

604
00:35:47,526 --> 00:35:50,037
Rym: In the meta moment, we're back from PAX Unplugged.

605
00:35:50,077 --> 00:35:53,052
Rym: We'll try to get video of our two panels up when we get a chance.

606
00:35:53,072 --> 00:35:54,418
Scott: Oh, I forgot to bring it.

607
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:55,222
Rym: That's fine.

608
00:35:55,323 --> 00:35:57,975
Scott: I have it backed up in three places, just not with me.

609
00:35:58,196 --> 00:35:58,739
Rym: Yeah, that's fine.

610
00:35:58,779 --> 00:36:02,536
Rym: I'm not going to have time to edit shit until this weekend, even if then.

611
00:36:02,556 --> 00:36:11,214
Rym: And also, I'm going to get PAX to give me the actual video they took, because at the 40 tabletop games you must play, we didn't just do the panel in a panel room.

612
00:36:11,535 --> 00:36:14,650
Rym: It was in the big panel room, so it was live streamed on the PAX Twitch.

613
00:36:14,771 --> 00:36:18,330
Scott: So can you go to the PAX Twitch, and is there a VOD available to see it right now?

614
00:36:18,491 --> 00:36:20,461
Rym: I'm not sure, because I haven't had a chance to go check.

615
00:36:20,561 --> 00:36:23,050
Scott: Well, go check the twitch.tv/pax2.

616
00:36:23,351 --> 00:36:25,538
Rym: Yeah, I assume it was PAX 2.

617
00:36:25,538 --> 00:36:29,374
Scott: I assume it's PAX 2, but check all the official PAX Twitch TV channels.

618
00:36:29,494 --> 00:36:32,970
Rym: GeekNights is moderately popular, we are not popular enough to be PAX 1.

619
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,638
Scott: Right, look at their VOD, this main theater.

620
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:41,630
Rym: Yeah, the day we're in the main theater is either the day that something crazy has happened, or the day that PAX has made a terrible mistake.

621
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:48,862
Scott: Right, check the saved videos attached to those Twitch channels, and see if you can find our panel, if you really have nothing better to do.

622
00:36:49,745 --> 00:36:50,026
Rym: Okay.

623
00:36:50,186 --> 00:36:58,173
Rym: Yep, and we will be now, upcoming at MagFest, doing like, a bunch of panels, you don't have to be on all of them if you don't want

624
00:36:58,193 --> 00:36:58,976
Scott: to, and

625
00:36:59,397 --> 00:37:01,746
Rym: we will be at PAX South in San

626
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:03,311
Scott: Antonio, like right after that,

627
00:37:04,054 --> 00:37:10,597
Rym: doing at least one panel, and that panel is a brand new one that I still have to write, nostalgia versus game design.

628
00:37:10,617 --> 00:37:13,951
Rym: I think we're going to talk about Windjammers at least once in this panel.

629
00:37:13,991 --> 00:37:18,550
Scott: No one wanted to accept my panel about harmful games.

630
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,116
Rym: I think we're going to do that one at PAX East.

631
00:37:20,517 --> 00:37:20,878
Scott: Okay.

632
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:23,349
Rym: That's a good place, I think PAX East is a good place for that one.

633
00:37:24,615 --> 00:37:26,704
Rym: Maybe at MagFest I might sneak it in into mages, we'll see.

634
00:37:27,387 --> 00:37:27,989
Rym: So stay tuned.

635
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:34,158
Rym: Otherwise the Book of the Book is 2001, Space Odyssey, I have a lot of downtime over the holidays, I'll probably read it.

636
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:40,522
Scott: I do not have to go to work from Christmas through New Year, and I'm only not partying until New Year.

637
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:43,693
Rym: Oh, the cold guy says it was on PAX 2.

638
00:37:43,693 --> 00:37:44,315
Scott: It was on PAX 2.

639
00:37:44,315 --> 00:37:46,563
Rym: Because PAX 3 was a different room.

640
00:37:46,804 --> 00:37:49,634
Scott: Alright, well verify if the video is there or not.

641
00:37:49,654 --> 00:37:50,296
Scott: When I get a chance.

642
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:51,822
Rym: I've been busy.

643
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:52,424
Scott: Okay.

644
00:37:52,825 --> 00:37:55,413
Rym: I haven't even unpacked from PAX yet, give me a break.

645
00:37:56,437 --> 00:38:05,316
Rym: God, it's always hard to, like, our lives are different now from what they were a decade ago, but every year we'd be like, oh it's time for PAX, this once a year event.

646
00:38:05,557 --> 00:38:18,943
Rym: So I get like five PAXs a year now, two of them, I've got three, four gaming conventions in the world, we're going to be doing Eeknights, you know, we might miss some because holidays and shit, right?

647
00:38:19,024 --> 00:38:22,520
Scott: So, you know how it is, next week there'll be a Monday Wednesday, hopefully.

648
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,442
Rym: Yep, hopefully.

649
00:38:23,743 --> 00:38:36,258
Rym: But I do intend to do some other shows when Scott's not around, and both of us, when shows don't happen, we'll probably be livestreaming a bunch of stuff, and sometime soon we're going to be judging the upcoming season of anime.

650
00:38:36,318 --> 00:38:37,464
Scott: Yeah, we have to do that in December.

651
00:38:37,644 --> 00:38:37,905
Rym: Yep.

652
00:38:38,146 --> 00:38:48,610
Rym: And if you look at our website now, you can see when we judged the previous season of anime, the fall season before it came out, so you can find out if we were right about Tokyo Ghoul Re 2 or whatever.

653
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:52,866
Scott: Alright, so, we're going to talk about a game called Treasure Island, the most...

654
00:38:53,307 --> 00:38:56,822
Rym: Oh, someone in the stream just linked to the VOD of the stream.

655
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:57,404
Scott: Good job.

656
00:38:57,525 --> 00:39:00,660
Rym: So yeah, go to the livestream right now, and you can click on this link.

657
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,818
Rym: I hope that link actually goes to it and out to a Rick Roll, I didn't check it.

658
00:39:03,999 --> 00:39:04,361
Scott: I hope so.

659
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:09,202
Scott: Anyway, so, Treasure Island, the most straightforward game name you could possibly think of.

660
00:39:09,262 --> 00:39:12,839
Scott: Yes, it's just directly based on the book, there's a Long John Silver.

661
00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:15,550
Rym: The Black Spot, the Monkey, everything.

662
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:19,426
Scott: It's pirate themed, it's literally just fucking Treasure Island, the game.

663
00:39:19,646 --> 00:39:20,148
Rym: So here's the deal.

664
00:39:20,168 --> 00:39:23,280
Scott: The way it works is it's a lot like Fury of Dracula.

665
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,190
Scott: One player is Long John Silver.

666
00:39:26,251 --> 00:39:26,552
Rym: Yarr.

667
00:39:26,632 --> 00:39:29,825
Rym: I played, the first and only time I played this game, I was Long John Silver.

668
00:39:30,126 --> 00:39:32,054
Rym: Holy shit, is that stressful and difficult.

669
00:39:32,295 --> 00:39:35,087
Scott: The other four players are parrots.

670
00:39:35,127 --> 00:39:37,638
Scott: I don't remember if they're characters in the book or not, I assume they were.

671
00:39:37,658 --> 00:39:39,164
Scott: They're characters, whatever.

672
00:39:39,204 --> 00:39:41,051
Scott: They have slightly different powers.

673
00:39:41,433 --> 00:39:44,446
Rym: I haven't read, I've never read the book all the way through.

674
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:44,968
Rym: Oh, I have.

675
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,119
Rym: I read excerpts from it in elementary school.

676
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,545
Scott: But it was a very long time ago.

677
00:39:48,585 --> 00:39:48,846
Rym: Yeah.

678
00:39:49,247 --> 00:39:51,596
Rym: I saw the one old movie.

679
00:39:51,716 --> 00:39:54,611
Scott: I have better memories of Muppet Treasure Island, which I saw several times.

680
00:39:54,631 --> 00:39:58,489
Rym: I remember Muppet Treasure Island better than I remember any other form of Treasure Island.

681
00:39:58,529 --> 00:39:58,971
Scott: That is true.

682
00:39:59,594 --> 00:40:02,105
Scott: Anyway, Animal Treasure Island is also good.

683
00:40:02,607 --> 00:40:03,732
Scott: Is it Miyazaki or Tezuka?

684
00:40:03,933 --> 00:40:04,838
Rym: I've never actually seen it.

685
00:40:04,898 --> 00:40:06,725
Scott: I haven't seen it either, but I just know it exists.

686
00:40:06,826 --> 00:40:20,935
Scott: Anyway, the point is, this game, much like Fury of Dracula, has Long John Silver hiding a treasure instead of running around Europe like Dracula, and four players, up to four players working together to find the treasure.

687
00:40:20,995 --> 00:40:27,455
Scott: But, not really together unlike Fury of Dracula, they're competing to who gets the treasure first.

688
00:40:27,656 --> 00:40:28,017
Rym: Yup.

689
00:40:28,638 --> 00:40:33,137
Rym: And the other conceit that's interesting is that Long John Silver, the game is basically.

690
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:36,028
Rym: Long John Silver is being interrogated by the pirates.

691
00:40:36,068 --> 00:40:37,112
Scott: He's in jail.

692
00:40:37,534 --> 00:40:38,839
Scott: On the island somewhere.

693
00:40:38,919 --> 00:40:44,705
Rym: So first he's just being interrogated, and you have to use cards to basically give clues about where the treasure is.

694
00:40:44,745 --> 00:40:49,587
Scott: Right, well Long John, while he's being interrogated, gives clues to the interrogators.

695
00:40:49,728 --> 00:40:56,797
Rym: But then at some point, during one of the turns, one of the players puts Long John in a prison on the island somewhere.

696
00:40:56,857 --> 00:41:00,132
Scott: Right, there are several prisons on the map, Long John is in one of them.

697
00:41:00,474 --> 00:41:02,041
Scott: At some point you find out which one he's in.

698
00:41:02,302 --> 00:41:14,652
Rym: Eventually, the end of the game, if none of the pirates found the treasure, Long John breaks out, and now moves around the map with the same rules as the players, and if Long John gets to his own treasure, he wins, fuck you all.

699
00:41:14,953 --> 00:41:15,194
Scott: Right.

700
00:41:16,358 --> 00:41:30,058
Scott: One other thing is that Long John is giving these clues to the players, whether they use their powers, or just every turn he has to sort of do something, or every so often he has to give information to the interrogators, but he can lie up to two times during the game.

701
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:37,345
Scott: He doesn't actually have to lie, but two of his clues, all the clues must be true, except up to two of them may or may not be true.

702
00:41:37,365 --> 00:41:48,891
Rym: Yep, and the may or may not is key, because one of my lie attempt, like possibilities of lies, I actually told the truth to try to double cross the players, and it worked on everyone but one player.

703
00:41:48,932 --> 00:41:55,405
Scott: Because you basically tell the truth, you put the lying token next to it, a player uses their power to look at the token, and the other players don't see it.

704
00:41:55,545 --> 00:42:03,680
Scott: They see it, that player now sees like a question mark, right, but they assume, oh that means it's not true, and they invert that thing, it's like no actually.

705
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:11,490
Rym: So get this, this happened in the game, so our friend Tracy, he assumed that the first clue I put down was a lie, and he was right.

706
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:16,394
Scott: I thought you're not allowed to lie in the first one, you can't get a lie token until like the third.

707
00:42:16,695 --> 00:42:19,137
Rym: No, you get one lie token at the beginning of the game, and you get one about half way through.

708
00:42:19,157 --> 00:42:21,069
Scott: I thought you get one like after turn X or something.

709
00:42:21,089 --> 00:42:23,080
Rym: Yeah, you get the second one after turn X. Oh okay.

710
00:42:23,863 --> 00:42:26,898
Rym: You have to put one clue out that you can't lie about before the game starts.

711
00:42:27,058 --> 00:42:27,400
Rym: That's right.

712
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:28,985
Rym: Then you put ones out.

713
00:42:29,226 --> 00:42:33,763
Rym: The first one I put out that I had discretion, I put the lie token, and I did lie.

714
00:42:34,706 --> 00:42:48,613
Rym: Tracy said before the game started, I bet Ram will put the lie tokens out but not actually lie, but then he used his power immediately to check to see if I lied in the first turn, and of course I did, and I did lie.

715
00:42:48,633 --> 00:43:02,429
Rym: He then played the beginning of the game, searching and acting as though he thought I was telling the truth, trying to trick the other three pirates into thinking that I had told the truth there, when in fact he thought I had lied, and in fact I had lied.

716
00:43:03,271 --> 00:43:04,896
Rym: That was really well played.

717
00:43:05,538 --> 00:43:19,192
Scott: The point is, this game when you see it, is a huge ton of fun, because you're not just moving around a map, right, you know with little tokens like a normal game, you're drawing on the map, everyone has a personal map that they can draw on.

718
00:43:19,373 --> 00:43:21,160
Rym: Yup, including Long John Silver.

719
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:26,202
Scott: Right, the game comes with all these dry erase markers and a compass, you can draw radiuses, radii.

720
00:43:26,222 --> 00:43:32,532
Rym: Yup, there's a ruler, if you move, you like draw on the ruler how many miles you're going to move, there's a smaller rule for the minimaps.

721
00:43:32,572 --> 00:43:32,914
Rym: Much, it's

722
00:43:32,974 --> 00:44:03,811
Scott: very theme appropriate, it's like you're using all these sort of nautical-ish, much simpler than actual nautical sextants or whatever, but you know, tools to draw on this map, the shared map as well as your personal maps, they give you a mini ruler, so you can use that on your tiny map, and it's at scale to the big ruler you use on the big map, right, so you can measure things out privately, you know, and it's like, oh, you can see, so you'll be like, ah, yes, the treasure is within three of one of these players, stuff like that.

723
00:44:03,871 --> 00:44:09,778
Scott: But then of all the players, everyone starts drawing circles and being like, okay, it's got to be in one of these circles.

724
00:44:09,818 --> 00:44:26,628
Rym: But some of the clues are things that I hand to the other players, so each player knows like five sets of information independently of one another, and then collectively they know another set of information, but that set of information may or may not be true, and different players might have looked at different tokens.

725
00:44:26,648 --> 00:44:28,801
Scott: And the players aren't sharing info with each other.

726
00:44:28,902 --> 00:44:29,345
Rym: Hell no.

727
00:44:29,526 --> 00:44:41,565
Scott: So even though it might be like, if all the players shared info, they might know exactly where the treasure is right away, because they each have separate info, right, it's like, well, it's going to take any one player a longer amount of time to figure out where the treasure is.

728
00:44:41,726 --> 00:44:55,787
Rym: This also means that since I was long John Silver, I was keeping track of, as best I could, the kinds of information I'd given to different players to try to give individual players worthless information to them if I had the opportunity to give just them information.

729
00:44:56,370 --> 00:45:04,286
Rym: And I successfully gave two players fucking bullshit because I knew things they knew and I gave them the same information over and over again via different mechanisms.

730
00:45:05,008 --> 00:45:06,854
Scott: So that's basically how this game goes.

731
00:45:07,035 --> 00:45:15,990
Scott: Long John tries to give as little information as possible, the players do a Scotland Yard, Fury of Dracula kind of narrowing down possibilities thing.

732
00:45:16,191 --> 00:45:22,658
Scott: They walk in, they walk along the map to the possible areas, use their searching ability and attempting to find the treasure.

733
00:45:22,819 --> 00:45:29,566
Rym: So the fun part is that the placement rules for the treasure are literally, I just fucking mark an X anywhere.

734
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:29,947
Scott: Yup.

735
00:45:30,289 --> 00:45:33,342
Scott: Anywhere on this whole, the map doesn't really have like a grid or anything.

736
00:45:33,362 --> 00:45:35,856
Scott: It's just a picture of an island with a bunch of features on it.

737
00:45:36,217 --> 00:45:39,275
Scott: And you put a dot on your private map and that's what the treasure is.

738
00:45:39,295 --> 00:45:45,019
Rym: And of course what Scott was musing that I would do and what I did in fact do is I drew one goddamn pixel.

739
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:45,521
Rym: That's right.

740
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:50,180
Rym: And I was like, it is here at the intersection of the edge of this building and this forest.

741
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:50,641
Scott: Yup.

742
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:52,670
Scott: You're very precise and where the treasure was.

743
00:45:52,691 --> 00:45:54,861
Scott: So if someone came close and someone did.

744
00:45:54,881 --> 00:45:58,053
Rym: Someone came literally within like two millimeters.

745
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:00,121
Scott: They were more like a centimeter away.

746
00:46:00,161 --> 00:46:01,207
Rym: They were less than a centimeter.

747
00:46:01,227 --> 00:46:06,433
Scott: But the point is, is they came real close and but their circle clearly was not on the spot you had selected.

748
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:07,780
Scott: So no treasure for you.

749
00:46:07,981 --> 00:46:18,146
Rym: And the way you search and there's a fun little bit here is you use this little ring and you literally draw on the big map, a circle around where you're searching and the ring has to fit around your character.

750
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:20,135
Rym: So where you move to, like you're really limited.

751
00:46:20,155 --> 00:46:22,827
Rym: And then I have to decide if it's inside or not.

752
00:46:23,108 --> 00:46:27,545
Rym: The rule is if there's any question as to whether or not it's inside, it is.

753
00:46:28,167 --> 00:46:39,228
Rym: Hence, I literally put a dot on my map and then I use my fingernail to shave off pieces of that dot because the felt to the marker is only so precise to make it down to like this one pixel.

754
00:46:39,248 --> 00:46:42,585
Rym: And then I took a picture of it in case I accidentally smudge that one pixel off.

755
00:46:42,765 --> 00:46:42,946
Scott: Yep.

756
00:46:43,428 --> 00:46:53,830
Scott: But anyway, the one very interesting mechanic in this game is that when players search, if they find the treasure, Long John takes this little cardboard treasure chest, puts the big treasure token.

757
00:46:54,212 --> 00:46:55,498
Scott: So hands it to the player.

758
00:46:55,578 --> 00:46:56,121
Scott: They open it.

759
00:46:56,161 --> 00:46:57,025
Scott: The big treasures in there.

760
00:46:57,045 --> 00:46:57,407
Scott: They win.

761
00:46:57,527 --> 00:47:02,570
Rym: When anyone searches, what I did is I took the the treasure chest, this big cardboard box.

762
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:04,397
Rym: I either put nothing in it.

763
00:47:04,798 --> 00:47:07,596
Rym: I put one of the mini treasures that I can give out of my own discretion.

764
00:47:07,636 --> 00:47:08,642
Rym: There's reasons why you would.

765
00:47:08,662 --> 00:47:09,004
Rym: Yep.

766
00:47:09,386 --> 00:47:12,804
Rym: Or if they got it right, I just would have put the big treasure in and not said anything.

767
00:47:12,885 --> 00:47:13,066
Scott: Right.

768
00:47:13,086 --> 00:47:13,951
Scott: That's what you're supposed to do.

769
00:47:13,991 --> 00:47:17,669
Scott: But what I'm saying is the clever mechanic is those small treasures.

770
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:18,211
Scott: Yeah.

771
00:47:18,292 --> 00:47:22,869
Scott: Long John has to give out these clues as the game goes on to the players.

772
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,977
Scott: But it's like a deck of clues.

773
00:47:24,997 --> 00:47:25,699
Rym: The clues suck.

774
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,464
Rym: You read these clues.

775
00:47:26,524 --> 00:47:28,536
Rym: It's like, wow, any one of these will just fuck me.

776
00:47:28,576 --> 00:47:28,737
Scott: Right.

777
00:47:28,777 --> 00:47:35,870
Scott: The clues, if you have to give those clues, if you give them honestly, which you have to do all but two times, you're just going to tell them where the treasure is.

778
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:54,098
Scott: But if you give players these mini treasures when they search right, then what you can do is if you've given enough tiny treasures to the players, not the big treasure that makes you win the game, but the tiny ones that gives you access to these other clues that are weaker clues.

779
00:47:54,359 --> 00:48:00,808
Scott: and using the weaker clues is much easier because now you won't have to basically give the whole game away with your giant lousy clues.

780
00:48:00,848 --> 00:48:04,862
Rym: But now you've given players very powerful tools to use.

781
00:48:05,143 --> 00:48:05,404
Scott: Yes.

782
00:48:05,484 --> 00:48:10,962
Scott: Those tiny treasures give the players abilities that they can now use during the game.

783
00:48:11,303 --> 00:48:17,790
Scott: So it's like I can either give them TMI or I can give them less info, but more abilities to make their search easier.

784
00:48:18,212 --> 00:48:20,062
Scott: And you have to sort of figure out what you want to do.

785
00:48:20,323 --> 00:48:21,870
Scott: Meanwhile, players know this.

786
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:23,135
Scott: They know that's how the game works.

787
00:48:23,537 --> 00:48:29,602
Scott: So what players can do, which I learned after the first game, is don't use your searching ability early in the game.

788
00:48:30,104 --> 00:48:33,636
Scott: And thus Long John is forced to give the big clues.

789
00:48:33,656 --> 00:48:38,400
Scott: You can't give the little clues if you haven't searched because then he can't give you the little treasures.

790
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,207
Scott: Then again, you're also not searching.

791
00:48:40,227 --> 00:48:44,909
Scott: You're just walking around using other forms of clues and other actions besides the search action.

792
00:48:45,571 --> 00:48:47,439
Scott: So you got this balancing act going on.

793
00:48:47,459 --> 00:48:48,603
Scott: That's the cool part of the game.

794
00:48:48,623 --> 00:48:56,891
Scott: What I think is the problem with this game is that with intelligent players, I do not think Long John can win.

795
00:48:57,031 --> 00:48:58,236
Rym: So I played.

796
00:48:58,256 --> 00:49:00,245
Rym: I was Long John the first time ever played the game.

797
00:49:00,707 --> 00:49:07,812
Rym: Two of the people at the table had already played this game multiple times and all three of the pirates were very smart people.

798
00:49:07,932 --> 00:49:08,113
Scott: Yep.

799
00:49:09,095 --> 00:49:11,502
Rym: I was literally one turn from winning.

800
00:49:11,602 --> 00:49:15,419
Rym: I busted out of prison and I got right next to my fucking treasure.

801
00:49:15,439 --> 00:49:16,564
Scott: You would have gotten it next turn.

802
00:49:16,684 --> 00:49:17,829
Rym: You were definitely in range.

803
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:18,692
Rym: I did.

804
00:49:18,953 --> 00:49:22,530
Rym: They had narrowed down, but by the end of the game, they couldn't find the treasure.

805
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:28,578
Scott: Like I said, one person on that previous turn had searched less than a centimeter away from the treasure location.

806
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:33,314
Rym: They collectively narrowed it down to maybe six square centimeters on the entire map.

807
00:49:33,354 --> 00:49:33,514
Rym: Yep.

808
00:49:33,735 --> 00:49:50,705
Rym: Like they were so close and then I couldn't get, because I hosted myself by my own petard, because I drew my treasure dot as such a precise pixel, I was literally less than half a centimeter away from being able to just win.

809
00:49:51,728 --> 00:49:54,418
Rym: And then I lost in the last, last possible round.

810
00:49:54,678 --> 00:49:54,899
Scott: Yep.

811
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:56,084
Scott: I think, I mean, that's what I think is.

812
00:49:56,124 --> 00:49:58,194
Scott: I think it's calibrated in such a way.

813
00:49:58,214 --> 00:50:06,423
Scott: I think if the players are not that good at searching or are less skilled, I think a skilled Long John would just dominate.

814
00:50:06,483 --> 00:50:09,777
Rym: But I think a poor quality Long John will lose immediately.

815
00:50:09,797 --> 00:50:12,770
Scott: A poor quality Long John will lose immediately and give everything away.

816
00:50:13,212 --> 00:50:22,932
Scott: But amongst all skilled players where everyone is up on up, I think that the Long John, they can take the game into the late stages, but I don't think they can get away with it.

817
00:50:23,194 --> 00:50:27,652
Scott: It's, you know, I think what would be good is if you just kept exactly the same everything.

818
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:34,175
Scott: Don't change a thing, except make the map just maybe like six inches larger in both directions.

819
00:50:34,275 --> 00:50:40,497
Scott: That way with the same exact clues, right, you're making it a little harder to narrow it down.

820
00:50:40,577 --> 00:50:47,665
Scott: And maybe at the end, you know, it might also be a problem, but at least the players might have two choices and have to pick one.

821
00:50:47,685 --> 00:50:48,449
Scott: Right.

822
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:50,480
Scott: And it's like, OK, well, the game comes down to luck then.

823
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:54,498
Scott: Well, maybe it does, but at least it's not just sort of like this locked in thing.

824
00:50:54,659 --> 00:51:02,744
Rym: That's I also feel like if you get really fine tipped dry erase markers, you can make the game more interesting.

825
00:51:02,804 --> 00:51:05,617
Scott: because I would love to see a digital version of this game.

826
00:51:05,757 --> 00:51:06,360
Scott: Oh, hell yeah.

827
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:09,313
Scott: That was pixel perfect with zooming in and zooming out.

828
00:51:09,574 --> 00:51:14,394
Rym: I would play I would play it a lot where you had to literally click the exact pixel.

829
00:51:14,434 --> 00:51:22,143
Scott: I'm like, you know, like you get like a like you do your search, like a two thousand by two thousand JPEG and you must click.

830
00:51:22,384 --> 00:51:23,148
Scott: That would be what?

831
00:51:23,188 --> 00:51:24,152
Scott: Forty thousand pixels.

832
00:51:24,213 --> 00:51:27,448
Rym: Well, you got to search the area around your character that includes some number of right.

833
00:51:27,469 --> 00:51:33,757
Scott: Your search must include that pixel specifically if it is what that pixel is just outside the edge of your radius.

834
00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:34,661
Scott: You didn't get it.

835
00:51:35,284 --> 00:51:36,589
Rym: But the moral is like.

836
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:38,918
Rym: in the end, this game is way fun and worth owning.

837
00:51:38,938 --> 00:51:39,460
Rym: Yeah.

838
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:44,340
Scott: If you want to have a searching finding game, I would rather play this than Scotland Yard.

839
00:51:44,861 --> 00:51:47,430
Rym: Well, because Scotland Yard slash Mr.

840
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:48,072
Scott: X or whatever.

841
00:51:48,113 --> 00:51:54,559
Rym: If you're a computer scientist or even computer science adjacent, you can easily determine an algorithm that guarantees Mr.

842
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:55,363
Rym: X will lose.

843
00:51:55,564 --> 00:51:55,785
Rym: Yes.

844
00:51:56,468 --> 00:52:08,017
Scott: I would rather play this inferior of Dracula, because even though I like the hidden card movement and searching inferior Dracula a little bit better than the Treasure Island, I do not like any of the other parts of your Dracula.

845
00:52:08,057 --> 00:52:14,400
Rym: Dude, busting out the compass and drawing a giant fucking circle on this map is really, really satisfying.

846
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:14,901
Rym: Oh, yeah.

847
00:52:15,102 --> 00:52:20,585
Rym: Especially when the treasure is like a millimeter outside of that circle and you're just like, nope, stone face.

848
00:52:20,786 --> 00:52:22,010
Rym: Yep.

849
00:52:22,311 --> 00:52:27,106
Scott: There is a game I played that you did not play called Cryptid, which as a hex map.

850
00:52:27,628 --> 00:52:31,780
Scott: Oh, and you're trying to find a chupacabra or equivalent.

851
00:52:32,001 --> 00:52:32,242
Scott: Right.

852
00:52:32,323 --> 00:52:38,471
Scott: And it's in this room and there's clues like like, you know, different information that the players like, OK, I know it's not in a mountain hex.

853
00:52:38,873 --> 00:52:41,808
Scott: I know it's too away from a forest hex, that kind of thing.

854
00:52:41,828 --> 00:52:44,582
Scott: And you sort of narrow it down and see who can find it first.

855
00:52:44,863 --> 00:52:49,864
Scott: I played that game once and I won because I narrowed it down to three hexes and guessed and I guessed right.

856
00:52:51,508 --> 00:52:53,413
Scott: But, you know, it's similar.

857
00:52:53,814 --> 00:53:01,522
Scott: But Cryptid is, while perfectly fine, it does not have the fun of drawing with the sextant to the compass and all that biz.

858
00:53:01,683 --> 00:53:02,866
Rym: The drawing makes it real fun.

859
00:53:03,007 --> 00:53:04,191
Rym: Yeah.

860
00:53:04,492 --> 00:53:16,406
Scott: So in terms of while it is not perfect and has some flaws in terms of one versus many hide and seek games, I think Treasure Island may be the current number one of ones that I have played.

861
00:53:22,218 --> 00:53:24,445
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

871
00:54:50,211 --> 00:54:55,488
Rym: So expect I think four new panels and like six reruns in the next couple months.

872
00:54:56,031 --> 00:54:57,316
Rym: And now I leave you with...
