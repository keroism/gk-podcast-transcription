00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,289
Rym: It's Thursday, June 21st 2018.

2
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:11,810
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:14,680
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,163 --> 00:00:17,116
Rym: How we've changed in 20 years.

5
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,557
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:22,241 --> 00:00:27,820
Rym: So this is Thursday obviously not Tuesday, but it's worth mentioning that both Scott and I because it's on sale.

7
00:00:28,382 --> 00:00:29,145
Rym: But pub G.

8
00:00:29,185 --> 00:00:34,288
Scott: Well, I mean it was originally I was like, oh man that game looks like the kind of thing I want to play but I don't got time.

9
00:00:34,308 --> 00:00:39,780
Scott: and then I was like, you know Especially when he gave the guy who made it gave a talk at PAX East.

10
00:00:40,063 --> 00:00:41,800
Rym: He's actually really made me want to play.

11
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:43,612
Scott: Well, I mean, I already knew that I wanted.

12
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:44,759
Scott: it was my kind of game.

13
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:48,251
Scott: But I was like, you know that basically was like.

14
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:50,357
Scott: well, it is my kind of game confirmed.

15
00:00:50,398 --> 00:00:54,860
Rym: Like I thought Your kind of game and you won't play that but I missed the boat.

16
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:57,013
Scott: I was like, I'm too late for the pub G vote.

17
00:00:57,053 --> 00:01:00,859
Scott: I can't get into it now But suddenly the game is on sale and it's like.

18
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:01,362
Scott: well You know what?

19
00:01:01,422 --> 00:01:07,567
Scott: for 20 bucks even if I play it and then only for a short time like maybe a month or so You know and then stop playing it.

20
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,454
Scott: It'll be it's worth 20 bucks.

21
00:01:09,554 --> 00:01:11,080
Scott: steam sales started today, whatever.

22
00:01:11,543 --> 00:01:13,860
Scott: So I played it last night for the first time.

23
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:18,460
Scott: I played like between 10 and 20 matches and I killed one person.

24
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:22,733
Rym: I have so far killed zero people, but I almost killed one dude.

25
00:01:22,753 --> 00:01:24,218
Scott: This game is hard.

26
00:01:24,238 --> 00:01:26,407
Rym: Yeah, dude I almost killed me.

27
00:01:26,447 --> 00:01:29,440
Scott: still fun despite being hard and having some annoyances.

28
00:01:29,741 --> 00:01:34,180
Rym: Well, but also I like those early days when I picked up counter-strike and I was like wait, what's up with this game?

29
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:40,300
Scott: Also, I feel like people have told me that since I waited so long to play it it used to be worse.

30
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:51,319
Scott: So I actually feel like maybe if I started earlier I would have been pissed off at it for sucking a hole for having a lot of issues and it has been polished much in The time I was not playing it and now I am less angry at it.

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,718
Scott: No as a result, which I guess could be a good thing.

32
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:58,400
Scott: So I guess for me the game is far from dead despite, you know, not no longer being number one.

33
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:05,160
Rym: well, it's above this line that happens in games where it is Popular enough to where it might end up like counter-strike.

34
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,573
Rym: Well, it'll just always be kind of going in the background forever.

35
00:02:08,592 --> 00:02:10,199
Scott: It's gonna last longer than the tribes of two.

36
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:14,295
Rym: Yeah, I think it's tribes two is still probably the most fun.

37
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,443
Rym: I've had per unit time I played.

38
00:02:16,543 --> 00:02:18,110
Rym: you know, it's really online multiplayer.

39
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,459
Scott: It's really weird is obviously I suck ass at this game.

40
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:22,045
Scott: Yeah, but I played.

41
00:02:22,065 --> 00:02:22,868
Scott: there was a quake.

42
00:02:22,888 --> 00:02:25,637
Scott: champions is is is free on Steam.

43
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:26,420
Scott: you can get it for free.

44
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,286
Scott: It's a. it's like a free to play quake and I played that because it was free And it's the most loot box.

45
00:02:32,326 --> 00:02:34,211
Scott: It's basically quake plus loot boxes.

46
00:02:34,653 --> 00:02:37,240
Rym: I'm sick of this loot box and also classes.

47
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:40,772
Scott: But the loot boxes are purely cosmetic.

48
00:02:40,832 --> 00:02:41,113
Scott: They don't.

49
00:02:41,153 --> 00:02:44,109
Scott: there's not a single loot box thing I could find in the game.

50
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:47,868
Scott: that was any in any way Material to gameplay.

51
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:49,013
Scott: so it's not pay to win.

52
00:02:49,074 --> 00:02:50,260
Scott: It's it's a legit quake.

53
00:02:50,802 --> 00:02:57,788
Scott: It was way faster than quake 3 or quake arena or any or any quake that I've played recently Like a quick one.

54
00:02:57,989 --> 00:02:59,920
Scott: it was a full speed quake.

55
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:00,301
Scott: It was.

56
00:03:00,361 --> 00:03:05,740
Scott: I was like wow this I do not want this to be any faster because that will be beyond my abilities to control.

57
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,829
Scott: And you know what.

58
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:08,220
Scott: obviously I was a deathmatch.

59
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:23,454
Scott: it was like a team deathmatch where it's like just get as many kills as you can of people on that are not the same color as you and Despite the fact that I was not like the best or anything My team won every time I played and I got a respectable number of frags every time.

60
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,360
Scott: so I still have some amount of FPS skill.

61
00:03:26,104 --> 00:03:29,300
Scott: Yet PUBG is way way way way way slower.

62
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:36,360
Scott: It's like molasses compared to that quake champions and I killed one person because we happen to spawn in the same place.

63
00:03:36,806 --> 00:03:37,840
Scott: We were having a fistfight.

64
00:03:38,362 --> 00:03:41,636
Scott: Then they went to pick up a gun and they punched them to death while they were picking up the gun.

65
00:03:41,777 --> 00:03:48,540
Rym: the big difference is that PUBG is Not about FPS skills so much as about situational awareness skills.

66
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:52,137
Scott: I have no situational awareness pretty much almost every time I got shot.

67
00:03:52,177 --> 00:03:54,326
Scott: It was like oh my god These bullets coming from oh my god.

68
00:03:54,366 --> 00:03:54,747
Rym: Oh my god.

69
00:03:54,788 --> 00:03:55,109
Rym: I'm dead.

70
00:03:55,149 --> 00:03:57,860
Rym: It's always sniper across the map like picks me off.

71
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,385
Scott: Maybe it was a sniper.

72
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:00,449
Scott: I spin around.

73
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:01,412
Scott: I don't see anyone.

74
00:04:01,432 --> 00:04:02,877
Scott: I hide I get my scope out.

75
00:04:02,937 --> 00:04:03,720
Scott: I don't see anyone.

76
00:04:03,861 --> 00:04:05,005
Scott: I'm looking all over the place.

77
00:04:05,146 --> 00:04:07,375
Scott: my favorite moments are where you hear still shooting at me.

78
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:08,640
Scott: the bullets are landing real close.

79
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:17,100
Rym: I'll be like in the woods, and then I hear like And I'm not sure how if the gunfire was directed me or not so I freeze.

80
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:20,172
Scott: I'm gonna switch to using headphones to figure out.

81
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,180
Rym: Oh, yeah, 100% headphones when I play.

82
00:04:22,902 --> 00:04:27,696
Rym: But yeah, I mentioned it because the good news is we're gonna play PUBG and hang and like.

83
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:36,320
Rym: if you want to play with Us I think we'll be able to get some groups together because a lot of there's a bunch of forum I it's already playing PUBG who are way better than us, but also still really bad.

84
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:41,176
Scott: They're bad, but they're better than us, which is how bad we are, but they're awful.

85
00:04:41,778 --> 00:04:42,924
Scott: They're bad We're the worst.

86
00:04:43,024 --> 00:04:53,006
Rym: this is definitely the kind of game where if this had come out well They're poop we're diarrhea much like counter-strike and tribes - if this had come out while we were at RIT This would have been our lives.

87
00:04:53,448 --> 00:04:56,280
Rym: Oh probably I would have played this every goddamn day.

88
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,494
Rym: No, probably because it's got that arm a or like weapons factory thing.

89
00:05:00,574 --> 00:05:01,397
Scott: our may is our ma.

90
00:05:01,738 --> 00:05:09,474
Rym: our may thing to say is You have like 50 things to bind to your keyboard, and I just left all.

91
00:05:09,554 --> 00:05:11,500
Scott: I just left all defaults and learned them.

92
00:05:11,962 --> 00:05:14,460
Scott: I changed I don't like that all the defaults.

93
00:05:14,684 --> 00:05:22,552
Scott: I like some of them But I just decided it's what I do in life as I just learn defaults now Policy they all assume you inverted your y-axis course.

94
00:05:22,592 --> 00:05:22,833
Scott: I did.

95
00:05:22,954 --> 00:05:26,288
Rym: I did not but I Didn't change all the bindings willy-nilly.

96
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:37,778
Rym: what I did is I played the game and as soon as there was a thing I wanted to do and The default wasn't good only at the moment where I had a reason to do the thing in the course of the game Did I bind rebind it?

97
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:48,535
Rym: But I followed my ancient philosophy and a lot of the things you can do in this game are Analogous to things I used to bind to standard positions in old games that I used to play.

98
00:05:49,076 --> 00:05:56,351
Scott: so like grenade I don't know I haven't actually played a lot of FPS is where you can go prone And this is I think the only one I ever played.

99
00:05:56,371 --> 00:05:58,360
Scott: that where you can go prone was soldier of fortune.

100
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:00,810
Scott: I don't even remember if that's 100% correct.

101
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,075
Scott: Yeah, so that was new to me.

102
00:06:02,336 --> 00:06:07,640
Rym: Yeah going prone I ended up binding to crouching and I use it instead of crouching and crouching I found somewhere else.

103
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,957
Scott: Yeah, well crouching I like how you can run while crouching and also walk.

104
00:06:10,997 --> 00:06:13,928
Scott: walk crouching Yep, or you can like whatever.

105
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:20,498
Scott: I spent like five minutes just prone crawling through the only thing I was gonna complain about like I couldn't figure out how to use the scope.

106
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:24,907
Scott: like Right mouse button brings the gun up to aim But it doesn't to give you.

107
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,172
Scott: I had a big scope on the thing.

108
00:06:26,212 --> 00:06:28,160
Scott: a scope I found was an item on the ground.

109
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,715
Scott: I attach it to the gun and I couldn't figure out how to get the scope.

110
00:06:31,117 --> 00:06:37,760
Scott: and then I Googled and it said double click the right mouse button and that wasn't because it wasn't a binding like activate scope in the settings.

111
00:06:38,282 --> 00:06:42,100
Scott: And then I was like I was annoyed that the game didn't teach me that and it was.

112
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:45,091
Scott: But actually that's a good default.

113
00:06:45,131 --> 00:06:45,553
Scott: I liked it.

114
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,360
Rym: So also you notice you can bind.

115
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:55,300
Rym: anyway, we'll talk about this in a Tuesday show, but we're playing pub G and It's tates eating into my overwatch time, which is a problem.

116
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,855
Scott: I'm playing pub G and hearthstone and netrunner died and I finished.

117
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:03,952
Scott: I went back and beat Skyrim And Mario tennis comes out like did air tomorrow.

118
00:07:03,972 --> 00:07:06,042
Rym: I actually started playing fallout 4.

119
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:07,287
Rym: Okay, cuz I never actually played it.

120
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:16,820
Scott: not playing that, you know, it's on Steam sale for 30 Which is too much cuz I got it in VR and it's just if you have VR and you have that game.

121
00:07:16,921 --> 00:07:23,257
Rym: It's real fun to play in VR But it wouldn't be worth getting VR just to have that experience is the way I'd put it.

122
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:27,028
Scott: Hmm So I'm interested in the 76 weather.

123
00:07:27,308 --> 00:07:36,198
Rym: Yeah, I'm actually really into the online aspect of it because I As a 36 year old I don't have time for single-player games that are long.

124
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,900
Scott: Nope The way I played Skyrim just now an easy mode and I blitz through it and ignored all the garbage.

125
00:07:43,261 --> 00:07:46,734
Rym: I feel I have this feel like I want to play Final Fantasy 4 again.

126
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:48,440
Scott: No, you can't cheat and blitz.

127
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,680
Scott: Yeah, I think I'm just gonna cheat.

128
00:07:49,760 --> 00:08:00,540
Scott: I'm actually considering playing Final Fantasy 6 and chrono trigger and cheating to just make like turn off all random encounters and make my Characters like level nine nine nine nine nine nine nine and just win every combat without doing anything.

129
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:06,326
Scott: All I do is walk around and talk to everyone in town and then Explore the dungeons for Final Fantasy.

130
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:11,183
Rym: one cuz I was feeling a weird craving to play that again like a really weird craving like oh I could cheat at that too.

131
00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:12,428
Scott: No, don't even need to cheat.

132
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:14,858
Rym: I just watch an AGD Q speedrun.

133
00:08:14,878 --> 00:08:16,844
Scott: That's glitchless Yeah, but I can't.

134
00:08:17,065 --> 00:08:18,232
Scott: they don't talk to everyone in town.

135
00:08:18,252 --> 00:08:19,560
Scott: That's what I want to do is the talking.

136
00:08:21,225 --> 00:08:21,649
Rym: We need a.

137
00:08:21,852 --> 00:08:24,751
Scott: you got a white guy As GD Q starts in like a week.

138
00:08:24,993 --> 00:08:25,798
Rym: I know my god.

139
00:08:26,261 --> 00:08:27,645
Scott: Or does it start this Sunday?

140
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:28,207
Scott: it starts soon.

141
00:08:28,247 --> 00:08:36,890
Rym: speaking of things that are long that I don't have time for the World Cups happening yeah, and Because I work in a very very international company.

142
00:08:37,312 --> 00:08:39,980
Rym: It's very interesting to see the stark line.

143
00:08:40,624 --> 00:08:49,124
Rym: Most of the people who care about the World Cup Were not born in the United States and most of the people who do not care about the World Cup were born in the United States.

144
00:08:49,185 --> 00:08:50,459
Rym: that is what I have noticed.

145
00:08:51,082 --> 00:08:55,440
Scott: Well, I mean the thing is the World Cup like as much as we rag on the sport of soccer, right?

146
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,384
Scott: It's like the World Cup.

147
00:08:56,445 --> 00:08:57,268
Rym: It's a cultural touch.

148
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,780
Scott: It happens fucking every four years.

149
00:09:00,364 --> 00:09:02,400
Scott: Right, all the teams are based on countries.

150
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:09,220
Scott: So it's not like you got these teams of like, you know, whoever players you manage You know the rich team gets all the good players.

151
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,482
Scott: It's like.

152
00:09:09,522 --> 00:09:10,489
Scott: no it's country based.

153
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:12,160
Scott: where the country you're from is the team you play.

154
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,600
Rym: I think the rich country does all the best players, but that doesn't end up being the case, right?

155
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:24,100
Scott: it doesn't happen that often and It's like the most and it's like, you know, it's the most cared about but it's like it is for serious.

156
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:30,994
Scott: It's like I you know and all the aspects if they just weren't playing soccer I would be say would be more into it than like any other sporting events.

157
00:09:31,035 --> 00:09:35,680
Scott: people who don't disrespect soccer Obviously, it's the biggest fucking deal in the universe.

158
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,359
Scott: Which one day there'll be an eSports that is that big.

159
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:41,626
Rym: I'll be at work cuz it's a giant like.

160
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:42,910
Rym: I'm on this giant open floor.

161
00:09:43,091 --> 00:09:45,520
Scott: It's on even in my newer small work.

162
00:09:45,962 --> 00:09:47,412
Scott: It's on this in the kitchen.

163
00:09:47,432 --> 00:09:48,640
Scott: They got a projector aimed at the wall.

164
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:54,600
Scott: Everyone who cares and it's like all the games are on on their second monitor anytime you go to any restaurant in the city.

165
00:09:54,702 --> 00:09:57,855
Scott: right now The game if there's a game on it's on.

166
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:01,834
Rym: yep Every now and then I hear a little commotion because something big happened in a game.

167
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:07,157
Scott: everyone I walk around the office I'd say 25% of the screens have a little stream in the corner.

168
00:10:07,177 --> 00:10:14,240
Rym: Yeah but In terms of the World Cup, I don't know.

169
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,648
Rym: There's a big bracket and people are like really excited.

170
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:20,500
Rym: It's still the great stage and I just don't know they're betting.

171
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:24,293
Rym: Yeah, no people are really invested in this like company-wide bracket.

172
00:10:24,675 --> 00:10:25,578
Scott: Maybe this big pad.

173
00:10:25,598 --> 00:10:26,863
Scott: if you get it, right You give big money.

174
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:36,180
Rym: Well, apparently anyone who has a Bloomberg terminal not just employees This is like anyone has the terminal can be involved in this really really elaborate bracket.

175
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:36,722
Rym: Mm-hmm.

176
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,971
Rym: That's like right there like type magic word.

177
00:10:39,332 --> 00:10:41,240
Rym: That's the official bracket like go for it.

178
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:48,891
Scott: Why don't you go and just figure out like, you know, the this go to the odds makers who you know And they'll say these are the best odds.

179
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:50,400
Scott: just bet on the most likely outcome.

180
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,523
Rym: I don't know though.

181
00:10:51,543 --> 00:10:56,958
Rym: Meanwhile, at least for the Stanley Cup Emily's bracket was was scarily open the envelope Lisa accurate.

182
00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:11,835
Scott: Hmm so yeah World Cup's happening and Yeah, I'm not really gonna watch it cuz it but I mean I watch it when I'm sitting in the room or restaurant But I never intentionally I haven't.

183
00:11:11,915 --> 00:11:16,095
Scott: I've yet to Purposely to go to Google and like look for the stream and open it.

184
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,046
Scott: Yeah, right It's just if it's on.

185
00:11:18,087 --> 00:11:19,679
Scott: I'm watching it, but I don't turn it on.

186
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:33,740
Rym: So in some sad news if you didn't see this Coco the very famous awesome gorilla who could speak sign language Pretty well and was smarter than a lot of humans like legit smarter than a lot of humans, especially very young humans.

187
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,151
Rym: Yeah, I mean they reading this article also made stronger than every human ever.

188
00:11:38,391 --> 00:11:45,437
Rym: they estimate her probably IQ was between was around 75 to 95. that's that's for his gump level.

189
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:50,520
Rym: Mmm That's but Coco was an amazing gorilla and it's kind of sad that Coco is dead.

190
00:11:51,182 --> 00:11:58,589
Rym: And if you do not know about Coco, you should watch some of these videos and learn about Coco because I mean I think people have like heard of Coco.

191
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,398
Scott: It's like why it's like they know.

192
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:03,784
Scott: Oh, yeah There's a girl that knows sign language But like a gorilla

193
00:12:03,965 --> 00:12:17,779
Rym: who got bored one day and ripped the sink out of her enclosure And when the handlers asked her what happened to the sink She literally lied to them in sign language in English and said her pet cat did it.

194
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:24,366
Rym: That is a level of deception that many humans are incapable of Straight facedly lying.

195
00:12:24,426 --> 00:12:34,486
Scott: and what would be even better is if somehow we could tell that Coco is actually, you know Not not lying thinking it would work But you know making it funny joke.

196
00:12:34,907 --> 00:12:35,650
Rym: Coco made jokes.

197
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,920
Rym: from what I've read like Coco understood our concept of humor.

198
00:12:40,182 --> 00:12:46,799
Rym: So you should learn about Coco if you don't know because if you don't if you haven't really watched videos of Coco interacting with humans.

199
00:12:47,995 --> 00:12:54,178
Rym: it There's a difference between knowing Coco existed and crocking the ramifications of a gorilla.

200
00:12:54,238 --> 00:12:54,880
Rym: who is that?

201
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:58,100
Rym: Intelligent in a way that humans can comprehend and you know.

202
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:05,860
Scott: This is one of the reasons why despite eating meats I don't eat monkey brain and I won't eat octopus and I won't eat dolphin.

203
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:11,440
Rym: I really try to avoid eating octopus, but occasionally I bump into it.

204
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,552
Scott: I mean it helps that octopus is way chewy and I don't like it.

205
00:13:15,592 --> 00:13:18,200
Rym: Anyway, yeah, it's only chewy if it's not the best octopus.

206
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,576
Scott: I also usually avoid eating squid because even though squids are way dumber than octopuses.

207
00:13:22,616 --> 00:13:30,860
Scott: They're also chewy Chewing kind of a. yeah, I just I just really like the image the anime manga image of like a yaga's a chewing on a dried.

208
00:13:33,723 --> 00:13:37,360
Rym: So in some other news that's actually pretty interesting because stuff's moving rapidly.

209
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:42,414
Rym: So if you didn't notice Canada legit fully legalized cannabis like fully.

210
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,103
Scott: so you can just go to Canada get high There's.

211
00:13:45,143 --> 00:13:51,660
Scott: no you're not breaking any law at all whatsoever Yep, and you can just open up a weed store in Canada and just so lead to any Canadian.

212
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,051
Rym: No, it's funny is in a bunch of parts like in Toronto.

213
00:13:54,152 --> 00:13:54,775
Scott: Is that what I say?

214
00:13:54,915 --> 00:13:55,880
Scott: I'm just confirming that's true.

215
00:13:56,262 --> 00:13:58,680
Rym: Uh, yes, but it doesn't fully take effect until I think October.

216
00:13:58,841 --> 00:13:59,926
Scott: So in October I can.

217
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:05,379
Scott: if I was Canadian citizen, I could go to Canada Yep in my backyard grow a bunch of weed.

218
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:10,317
Rym: Well debating whether or not they're gonna let people grow it themselves or how much they can grow.

219
00:14:10,357 --> 00:14:11,522
Scott: but probably okay I start.

220
00:14:11,562 --> 00:14:12,787
Scott: I can start a business in Canada.

221
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:13,692
Scott: That's a weed farm.

222
00:14:13,732 --> 00:14:16,243
Scott: Yep legitimately openly you can go to it.

223
00:14:16,263 --> 00:14:29,652
Rym: you can go to a wine store and be like smelly a. I would like a Bordeaux from 1988. or you can go to the weed store and the cannabista and be like I would like your finest lemon drop.

224
00:14:29,813 --> 00:14:31,140
Scott: I can sell it to anyone.

225
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:37,013
Scott: Anyone just sell it over the age of as much in any quantity or some.

226
00:14:37,313 --> 00:14:44,558
Rym: it looks like some provinces have the right to set The age 21 instead which I'm fine with and people who buy it just can walk up with.

227
00:14:44,638 --> 00:14:48,139
Scott: no We're just age-proof and you'll buy as much as they want.

228
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:52,132
Rym: There's a limit on how much you can buy but it's a really high limit.

229
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:53,034
Scott: They can buy like a bushel.

230
00:14:53,054 --> 00:14:59,376
Rym: Yeah A bushel of cannabis is a lot.

231
00:14:59,738 --> 00:15:00,020
Scott: I know.

232
00:15:02,422 --> 00:15:06,339
Scott: And then they can just smoke it wherever the fuck in the park in their house.

233
00:15:06,581 --> 00:15:09,037
Rym: You know if smoking it'll be restricted pretty much the same way.

234
00:15:09,057 --> 00:15:12,680
Rym: cigarettes are Fine with you can't like use it in dry.

235
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,182
Scott: What if they?

236
00:15:13,202 --> 00:15:16,437
Scott: what if they consume it in a non smoke emitting way?

237
00:15:16,477 --> 00:15:16,899
Scott: Can they do it?

238
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,034
Scott: Just fucking anywhere seems like you can just like go to a hockey game.

239
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:21,797
Scott: It's Canada, right?

240
00:15:21,817 --> 00:15:22,680
Scott: Just start eating.

241
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:24,265
Rym: Yeah, I mean people do that.

242
00:15:24,366 --> 00:15:27,075
Scott: Anyway, I know I mean I was in drug.

243
00:15:27,095 --> 00:15:29,529
Scott: you person who's vaping at the garden Fuck you just.

244
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,183
Rym: yeah vaping no good But lucky.

245
00:15:31,203 --> 00:15:34,880
Scott: I forgot that there was a text message number where you can report things happening in the stands.

246
00:15:35,694 --> 00:15:36,060
Scott: And you're lucky.

247
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,260
Scott: I forgot that number at that moment because I only only announced at the beginning of the game.

248
00:15:39,641 --> 00:15:43,151
Rym: Yeah, I mean when I'm staffing conventions, I shut down the kids vaping.

249
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:45,879
Rym: I don't care what they're vaping because it personally annoys me.

250
00:15:47,061 --> 00:15:51,073
Rym: But yeah, this is actually a big deal because it unlike the u.s.

251
00:15:51,113 --> 00:16:00,219
Rym: Where some states have done it and it's complicated Canada is only the second nation on earth to fully legalize it in an industrial capacity.

252
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:00,480
Rym: the way.

253
00:16:00,982 --> 00:16:04,398
Scott: Well, I mean there's countries where like this basically lawlessness.

254
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:08,887
Scott: Yeah Practices is the other one just Denmark.

255
00:16:09,128 --> 00:16:09,349
Rym: No.

256
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,935
Rym: No, it's Uruguay.

257
00:16:11,598 --> 00:16:18,971
Scott: Oh, okay But what what's I mean, I thought Denmark isn't famous for like having like, you know, please you can go to smoke Yeah, but apparently the law is actually pretty complicated there.

258
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:21,643
Scott: No, it's not just full open this Yeah, it's much.

259
00:16:21,804 --> 00:16:25,579
Rym: it's much more complex than even I realized and I don't know a lot about it.

260
00:16:26,222 --> 00:16:26,924
Scott: That's always like.

261
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:30,660
Scott: that's the famous place that used to be the famous place for weed smoking, but I guess not now.

262
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,169
Scott: Yeah, now everyone's gonna go to Canada and Portugal.

263
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:35,478
Scott: Mark's Denmark's tourism is gonna get hurt by Canadian tourists.

264
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:45,158
Rym: It's Portugal desert thing where they basically decriminalized all drugs, but they didn't legalize it like go to a store Just buy as much different decriminalization and legalization.

265
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:54,479
Rym: Yep so this is probably really good news for Canada's economy and It's probably good news for me because I own a bunch of Canadian weed stock.

266
00:16:54,801 --> 00:17:01,038
Scott: Well, the problem is is that people who smoke weed tend to lean to left and now they're all gonna move to Canada.

267
00:17:01,138 --> 00:17:04,634
Scott: for reals Not like before where they just talked about moving to Canada another.

268
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:08,489
Rym: I'm gonna move to get well Some other news that that will maybe buttress that.

269
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:17,414
Rym: so New York State actually suddenly started moving Very quickly to legalize it and part of that was the no, that's just fake Cuomo.

270
00:17:17,434 --> 00:17:22,329
Scott: Please reelect me and then yeah November We're not actually gonna do anything.

271
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,656
Rym: No, they're gonna do it this time.

272
00:17:23,698 --> 00:17:24,119
Scott: No, they're not.

273
00:17:24,221 --> 00:17:24,825
Rym: I think they are.

274
00:17:24,885 --> 00:17:27,059
Rym: believe it there's a couple of things going on.

275
00:17:27,682 --> 00:17:28,624
Rym: So this is all.

276
00:17:28,645 --> 00:17:30,310
Rym: this is my opinion my read into this.

277
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:42,592
Rym: but what happened was the New York State Health Department Issued after their multi-year study their actual guidance on Whether or not it should be legalized and what the consequences would be.

278
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:45,602
Rym: and the health department was like, yeah There's no reason.

279
00:17:45,642 --> 00:17:47,548
Rym: there's literally no reason not to legalize it.

280
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,852
Rym: not legalizing.

281
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:49,856
Rym: It harms people.

282
00:17:50,076 --> 00:17:51,180
Rym: It's not a gateway drug.

283
00:17:51,682 --> 00:17:53,409
Rym: It's way less bad for you than alcohol.

284
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:54,473
Rym: Like there's like go for it.

285
00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:56,100
Scott: It's definitely way less bad for you than alcohol.

286
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:03,240
Scott: Yep, except as long the thing is alcohol only hurts other people if you drive whereas smoking weed makes everything stink.

287
00:18:04,222 --> 00:18:08,059
Rym: Yeah, I don't think people should smoke weed for what?

288
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:21,587
Rym: but anyway, so the other part of this is that Cuomo who's always been very KG on cannabis legalization mostly because he acts like a progressive when selection year which it is Every other year he eggs like a Republican.

289
00:18:21,687 --> 00:18:28,260
Rym: half the population of New York State lives upstate and apparently hates all that is good And right with the world and the other half of the population lives.

290
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:43,398
Rym: There are cities upstate are but generally the governor of New York State has to get has to get deal with both the shitty people upstate in the rural parts of the country and the people in New York City who arguably outnumber them.

291
00:18:43,418 --> 00:18:54,417
Rym: and He basically ignores New York City and talks a lot about Upstate even if he doesn't do anything for the upstate because the upstate people get real mad and vote for Republicans.

292
00:18:54,437 --> 00:19:03,213
Rym: if you don't constantly To their baby as needs meanwhile the city He'll remember we exist during primary season.

293
00:19:03,634 --> 00:19:14,840
Scott: because if he doesn't try Here's the thing he needs the city votes for him to be elected because we have most of the people and governor is a popular vote.

294
00:19:14,924 --> 00:19:22,540
Scott: Yeah But he needs the primary which only New York City people really needs all the state so that he can control who is in the legislature.

295
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,413
Scott: So you can actually control what laws there are.

296
00:19:25,453 --> 00:19:26,417
Scott: cuz you're just the governor.

297
00:19:26,437 --> 00:19:27,060
Scott: you don't write laws.

298
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,466
Rym: I really don't like Cuomo.

299
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,900
Rym: I'm voting against him in the primary like I do every primary.

300
00:19:32,645 --> 00:19:33,229
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

301
00:19:33,914 --> 00:19:38,179
Rym: and Cynthia Nixon She checks off all the boxes of policy I want.

302
00:19:38,702 --> 00:19:43,240
Rym: But the reality is I'm gonna vote for whatever Democrat wins the primary because that's how things are right now.

303
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,040
Rym: But here's the other reason why I think he's going for it.

304
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,740
Rym: It's not just primary season and it's not just that and it's not just Canada.

305
00:19:51,405 --> 00:19:55,609
Rym: It's because New Jersey is Already moving faster to legalize it.

306
00:19:56,051 --> 00:20:02,954
Rym: and if New Jersey legalizes it first New Jersey's gonna get a shit ton of tax dollars that New York won't get.

307
00:20:02,974 --> 00:20:05,040
Scott: New Jersey's already got their sports gambling operation.

308
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:09,276
Rym: Yeah, New Jersey's moving real fast on this stuff and New York realizes.

309
00:20:09,316 --> 00:20:11,224
Rym: That's a lot of money They're leaving on the table.

310
00:20:11,546 --> 00:20:14,258
Rym: and that I think is the reason why this is suddenly moving.

311
00:20:14,278 --> 00:20:19,560
Scott: hmm The people go to Canada - we touch and we're touching both Canada and New Jersey.

312
00:20:20,301 --> 00:20:20,944
Scott: Stuck between.

313
00:20:21,266 --> 00:20:26,283
Scott: people will be driving their weed from Canada to New Jersey Or vice versa.

314
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:31,480
Rym: I feel like if New Jersey legalizes it first path trains are gonna get shockingly full.

315
00:20:33,343 --> 00:20:35,083
Scott: I Don't think.

316
00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:37,794
Scott: I think one person will just bring it over from the patreon.

317
00:20:37,835 --> 00:20:39,080
Scott: We don't need everyone get on the path.

318
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,579
Rym: Yeah, I feel like that is also gonna happen.

319
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:46,863
Scott: They'll just oh, why don't you buy some real estate on the other end of the path train next to the parking lot and make A weed shop there.

320
00:20:47,003 --> 00:20:48,408
Rym: I mean we've seen that happen.

321
00:20:48,428 --> 00:20:49,131
Rym: the United States.

322
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:58,097
Rym: There's precedent for this because if you don't live here some states in America allow you to have fireworks and some states do not exactly.

323
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:11,847
Rym: and if you Drive around the United States and you get near the border between a state that has fireworks in the state that doesn't you will notice a huge number of people selling fireworks Ten feet away from that border.

324
00:21:11,968 --> 00:21:12,630
Scott: You're literally.

325
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:18,748
Scott: you'll see a sign that says now entering Tennessee last By and then there's an explosion.

326
00:21:18,788 --> 00:21:20,796
Scott: There is a rest stop right there.

327
00:21:20,856 --> 00:21:23,368
Scott: as soon as you enter, Tennessee You don't need to exit the highway.

328
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:30,300
Scott: They'll just be a little turn-off and there's a Fire with a giant fireworks store right there ten feet across the line.

329
00:21:30,721 --> 00:21:40,875
Scott: And then when you turn around and you go back into the other state wherever the fuck you came from because Tennessee touches like six Tennessee is in fact the nearest state to us that has real fire touches a lot of states.

330
00:21:40,915 --> 00:21:47,940
Scott: you drive back across the border to A state where the fireworks are not legal and police are waiting on the other side of the side now entering wherever.

331
00:21:51,361 --> 00:22:01,020
Rym: Every single time my family went on a vacation like anywhere where we even went near, Tennessee We were diverted to Tennessee and fill the trunk with fireworks and bring it back into Michigan.

332
00:22:07,423 --> 00:22:09,400
Rym: but anyway things of the day.

333
00:22:10,381 --> 00:22:14,219
Rym: So I had a thing that I was gonna use but I found this story this morning.

334
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:24,260
Rym: I laughed out loud So hard at work as I read this story that it fit it fits the pure definition of thing of the day.

335
00:22:24,482 --> 00:22:26,238
Rym: It's the best thing I've seen today.

336
00:22:27,643 --> 00:22:28,630
Rym: I'm not gonna spoil.

337
00:22:29,195 --> 00:22:29,820
Rym: what the deal is.

338
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:35,280
Rym: It's a Twitter story as one of those ones where it's basically screenshots of the text of the story.

339
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:38,053
Scott: Just people copy and paste the text.

340
00:22:38,153 --> 00:22:39,520
Rym: come on the text is too big for a tweet.

341
00:22:39,721 --> 00:22:42,340
Scott: You put the text in a paste bin and post a link anyway.

342
00:22:42,521 --> 00:22:46,113
Rym: It's in this case and this is part of why I brought that up.

343
00:22:46,675 --> 00:23:05,837
Rym: the fact that is three Separate sections is very important to the humor and wonder of this story because screenshot one begins the tale of a plumber at a hotel Who is using a industrial drain snake to try to deal with a clog that they cannot deal with.

344
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:10,527
Rym: like There's this preternaturally difficult clog.

345
00:23:10,727 --> 00:23:14,115
Scott: It was it was the clog made of a living creature of some.

346
00:23:14,135 --> 00:23:21,840
Rym: so phase two is They pull something out of the drain and don't know what the fuck to do about it.

347
00:23:22,111 --> 00:23:24,527
Scott: Yeah It's some kind of horrible phase three.

348
00:23:24,547 --> 00:23:29,100
Rym: the third image is one of the funniest goddamn things I've ever read.

349
00:23:29,903 --> 00:23:32,459
Scott: Was it like a live raccoon or in the drain or something?

350
00:23:33,481 --> 00:23:34,925
Scott: Didn't drown all?

351
00:23:35,005 --> 00:23:37,331
Rym: I'm glad you've just got to read this story.

352
00:23:37,813 --> 00:23:40,299
Rym: I am NOT gonna in any way spoil this for you.

353
00:23:41,062 --> 00:23:43,653
Rym: It is real good, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

354
00:23:44,236 --> 00:23:46,144
Scott: some sort of sea creature It is.

355
00:23:46,164 --> 00:23:47,529
Scott: that's why I didn't drown.

356
00:23:48,251 --> 00:23:54,520
Rym: So let's just say that the second panel It it opened like what they pull something out of the drain.

357
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,466
Rym: I'll spell you for that.

358
00:23:55,486 --> 00:23:57,399
Scott: they use the snake and a snake came out.

359
00:23:57,479 --> 00:24:01,940
Scott: now Snakes the so I mean one in a real one what they found in the drain.

360
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,126
Rym: I will spoil that here.

361
00:24:03,146 --> 00:24:04,794
Rym: the sleep in the mystery is not a living thing.

362
00:24:04,815 --> 00:24:07,337
Rym: a human limb a shower curtain.

363
00:24:08,421 --> 00:24:13,779
Scott: Okay, an entire shower curtain was something wrapped in the shower curtain like a human limb.

364
00:24:14,546 --> 00:24:15,679
Rym: Just a shower curtain.

365
00:24:16,262 --> 00:24:21,380
Rym: Okay, and the mystery that is opened is that this is a hotel right a motel.

366
00:24:22,142 --> 00:24:27,500
Rym: The shower curtain is the shower curtain from the motel like the exact ones they use.

367
00:24:27,701 --> 00:24:29,166
Scott: But the shower still had a curtain.

368
00:24:29,186 --> 00:24:32,498
Rym: in the shower in the room that had the clog still had a shower curtain.

369
00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:37,871
Rym: Yes That the there was the resolution of the mystery is some good shit.

370
00:24:38,132 --> 00:24:41,923
Scott: if you're I imagine that how the the you know The housekeeping.

371
00:24:41,964 --> 00:24:44,374
Scott: if they come into a room and there's no curtain they put up a new curtain.

372
00:24:44,575 --> 00:24:45,378
Scott: They just have curtains.

373
00:24:45,499 --> 00:24:49,194
Rym: So yeah Well, yeah, I read this story where I read the second one.

374
00:24:49,254 --> 00:25:01,237
Rym: I'm debating like alright I'm trying to think of plausible scenarios, but I guarantee you will never in a million years guess how The shower curtain came to be in the drain because it is amazing.

375
00:25:01,257 --> 00:25:01,739
Rym: Okay?

376
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:11,390
Rym: It's so specific and detailed that if this is an elaborate like if someone just made this story up, they're an excellent writer Mmm, but I actually believe this is true.

377
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,133
Rym: Hmm.

378
00:25:12,474 --> 00:25:13,538
Rym: So anyway, that's my thing of the day.

379
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:13,920
Rym: What do you got?

380
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:20,980
Scott: so this is these people are at the zoo and They're next to the tiger zone where the Tigers hang.

381
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:30,232
Scott: That's a good place to hang out and you know the glass wall and then a moat and then some land and then some Tigers and You know, they're standing with their back to the to the Tigers chatting.

382
00:25:30,413 --> 00:25:32,180
Scott: Some of them are facing towards the Tigers, right?

383
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:42,030
Scott: you know just chatting with each other little group and one of the Tigers starts to quietly sneak up on Their party member while their cameras are.

384
00:25:42,271 --> 00:25:43,295
Scott: that is a quality.

385
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:44,720
Rym: I think the word here is stock.

386
00:25:45,182 --> 00:25:46,548
Scott: Yes, and they're like.

387
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:49,420
Scott: they're basically like don't turn around don't turn around don't move don't move.

388
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,291
Scott: We want to see the tiger keep creeping up on you.

389
00:25:51,331 --> 00:25:52,840
Scott: if you notice the tiger it'll stop creeping.

390
00:25:52,941 --> 00:25:54,129
Scott: We want to see it to keep creeping.

391
00:25:54,472 --> 00:25:54,975
Scott: don't move.

392
00:25:55,015 --> 00:25:55,660
Scott: Don't turn around.

393
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:02,239
Scott: Just stay still and the friends stay still and the tiger creeps and obviously I guess thankfully is blocked by the glass wall.

394
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:04,828
Rym: But tiger does what Tigers do?

395
00:26:04,848 --> 00:26:07,018
Scott: Yeah, you see the tiger do what he do.

396
00:26:07,965 --> 00:26:15,000
Scott: this is the best part of the video is There's a part where the tiger gets close to the glass wall and you can cuz nor the Tigers in the moat, right?

397
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:22,678
Scott: So you just see the top of its body moving slowly But when it gets close to the glass wall, you can see its feet moving slowly, right?

398
00:26:22,698 --> 00:26:28,116
Scott: Yeah that part Yeah, and you can see how the tiger how he creep and that's a good part.

399
00:26:28,377 --> 00:26:29,220
Rym: Tigers got a plan.

400
00:26:29,623 --> 00:26:31,360
Rym: Yeah, he's foiled by one thing.

401
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:41,072
Rym: So in the meta moment the GeekNights book club book which we're going to do very soon is Emily Wilson's translation of the Odyssey by Homer.

402
00:26:41,253 --> 00:26:42,920
Scott: if I had realized we needed to show today.

403
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,288
Scott: I could have read it faster instead of watching anime.

404
00:26:45,368 --> 00:26:46,050
Rym: pretty sure.

405
00:26:46,131 --> 00:26:47,896
Rym: the next pub G the night.

406
00:26:48,117 --> 00:26:49,982
Rym: Yeah, I was too The.

407
00:26:50,102 --> 00:26:57,000
Rym: I owe you the graphic designer stuff too, but I was playing pub G. But anyway the We're probably gonna do it on the next Thursday show.

408
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,144
Rym: So not next Thursday But the following Thursday.

409
00:26:59,445 --> 00:27:06,269
Rym: our next Thursday GeekNights show will probably be the GeekNights book club on this Translation of the Odyssey and it is give me a deadline.

410
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:06,510
Scott: Great.

411
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:09,926
Rym: I mean probably I said probably remember I am.

412
00:27:10,027 --> 00:27:11,599
Rym: my day job now is I am.

413
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:15,900
Rym: I'm one of the people who has to make the official decisions for very important things.

414
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,348
Scott: Just make the first decision go the gut every time.

415
00:27:18,368 --> 00:27:19,171
Scott: it won't take long.

416
00:27:19,331 --> 00:27:25,844
Rym: Ah, but I have learned very very carefully the arts of Promising something.

417
00:27:26,586 --> 00:27:32,868
Rym: but the actual words I say if parse logically do not actually promise shit That's your move.

418
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,820
Scott: Yeah, but now it's I mean your move.

419
00:27:34,981 --> 00:27:38,460
Rym: I've gone from being merely a dilettante in that skill to being a professional.

420
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:43,115
Rym: I am by the definition of the word a professional now at that move.

421
00:27:43,676 --> 00:27:45,748
Rym: I'm no longer an amateur I'm now.

422
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:51,720
Rym: I'm not a master of life I'm a professional of the act of promising something without actually promising anything.

423
00:27:52,201 --> 00:27:55,851
Rym: So notice I use words like we will be likely projected.

424
00:27:56,372 --> 00:27:56,954
Rym: we are project.

425
00:27:56,974 --> 00:27:58,979
Rym: We're targeting the next Thursday show.

426
00:28:00,284 --> 00:28:04,436
Rym: So, uh, yeah, uh Scott didn't want to talk about anything on this Thursday.

427
00:28:04,456 --> 00:28:05,040
Scott: Well, I do.

428
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,800
Scott: I just don't have any show ideas whatsoever nor time to think of one nothing at all.

429
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,920
Scott: So let's indulge him and let him do whatever he wants and then I can go home.

430
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:18,017
Rym: I was thinking about this recently about how we've changed over the years because I was looking for yes people change.

431
00:28:18,057 --> 00:28:18,860
Scott: is that happens?

432
00:28:19,461 --> 00:28:20,143
Scott: Life is long.

433
00:28:20,223 --> 00:28:23,855
Rym: Your whole life isn't the same but some things change and some things don't.

434
00:28:24,277 --> 00:28:26,964
Rym: what doesn't change How I look?

435
00:28:27,024 --> 00:28:29,133
Rym: apparently because I was looking for these old pictures.

436
00:28:29,153 --> 00:28:35,538
Rym: Well, you haven't changed how you look Yeah, but old pictures of Scott look very different because your face looks younger your hair is different.

437
00:28:35,618 --> 00:28:42,727
Rym: obviously I changed how I look but I look the fucking same when I was 19 as I do now Except my hair is.

438
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:44,580
Rym: I've got this tiny little bit of gray.

439
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,285
Rym: But I was thinking about like.

440
00:28:47,987 --> 00:28:48,589
Rym: have we changed?

441
00:28:48,609 --> 00:28:48,689
Rym: like?

442
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:50,133
Rym: are there opinions that have changed?

443
00:28:50,214 --> 00:28:52,300
Rym: are there like big parts of our lives?

444
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:52,826
Rym: that have changed?

445
00:28:52,847 --> 00:29:16,915
Rym: so draw to try a Strategy of pick various random areas of our lives GeekNights or non GeekNights and try to look back 10 years and 20 years and see if anything's actually changed like What we're rooming Scott doing in PC gaming compared to today in 2008 or 1998 in PC game PC gaming video

446
00:29:16,935 --> 00:29:18,257
Scott: gaming the iPhone.

447
00:29:18,317 --> 00:29:20,405
Scott: it was a year old 2008.

448
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:22,056
Scott: I was playing mostly we.

449
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:25,299
Rym: I thought PC gaming was dead.

450
00:29:26,383 --> 00:29:28,940
Scott: Yeah, we weren't playing too many PC 2008.

451
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,523
Rym: That's around.

452
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:32,600
Rym: when I was you trying to use that shitty Mac to make a podcast.

453
00:29:32,962 --> 00:29:38,044
Rym: Because and I was using I was using Linux on the desktop because there were no PC games I cared about.

454
00:29:38,065 --> 00:29:40,860
Scott: look at GeekNights' episodes in 2008.

455
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:50,871
Rym: yeah, I was looking at GeekNights' episodes in 2005 to try to figure some of that out, but tooth a like 2008 Rym only played console games.

456
00:29:50,931 --> 00:29:55,227
Rym: pretty sure is playing we in DS games and mobile games And I didn't play like.

457
00:29:55,267 --> 00:29:56,351
Rym: PC gaming was dead to me.

458
00:29:56,371 --> 00:30:02,849
Rym: if you look at 2018 Rym 100% PC 99% of PC 1% switch and if you go to 1998, it's all PC no console.

459
00:30:08,302 --> 00:30:13,214
Rym: So I every 10 years I flip to the exact opposite spectrum of video games.

460
00:30:13,656 --> 00:30:18,259
Rym: so by projection in 2028 I'm gonna be playing only console games.

461
00:30:19,007 --> 00:30:19,270
Scott: Mm-hmm.

462
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:20,903
Rym: Yeah, they're good.

463
00:30:21,164 --> 00:30:24,920
Rym: Did you play different games and do the night in 2008 like what games?

464
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,639
Rym: Did you play when you're just like sitting around?

465
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,028
Scott: I'm trying to remember.

466
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:28,999
Rym: you really don't remember.

467
00:30:29,562 --> 00:30:32,293
Scott: I just I'm remember that you mean you know blurs.

468
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:34,944
Scott: together with all the adjacent years I don't know.

469
00:30:34,944 --> 00:30:46,860
Rym: 2008 seems pretty because 2008 was the era when We'd been doing GeekNights for a while already But we were still pretty close to our college years like we were living up in Beacon.

470
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:51,160
Rym: We hadn't really made plans to leave or like move to the city or anything.

471
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:51,860
Scott: episodes.

472
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:58,500
Rym: 2008 like 2008 was an era when we would do GeekNights watch movies and play games and not do much else.

473
00:31:00,762 --> 00:31:05,562
Scott: See by the commander rearm doesn't 2008?

474
00:31:05,562 --> 00:31:16,147
Scott: Most of the episodes we did on the show were about old games But there was you know Wii games in here a lot of board games in here Professor Layton yet DS games.

475
00:31:16,689 --> 00:31:19,760
Rym: Yeah, I feel like that was the era of like the portable console.

476
00:31:20,001 --> 00:31:20,564
Scott: Oh, we did that.

477
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:22,073
Scott: our dwarf fortress episode was in 2008.

478
00:31:22,073 --> 00:31:25,593
Rym: Oh, yeah We tried to play dwarf fortress for a little while back then.

479
00:31:25,774 --> 00:31:26,136
Scott: Yes, that was.

480
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:26,880
Scott: it's a PC game.

481
00:31:27,081 --> 00:31:29,919
Scott: It's interesting though cuz back then I'm in a rear and I played that on PC.

482
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:34,619
Rym: Yeah, I guess that maybe that was the beginning of the resurgence of PC gaming.

483
00:31:35,401 --> 00:31:42,060
Rym: Cuz I remember 2009 is when I said fuck it drop Linux on the desktop drop Mac and went back to a Windows PC.

484
00:31:42,622 --> 00:31:44,750
Scott: I think I was mostly playing DS games in 2008.

485
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:56,342
Scott: Yeah, even bad ones Like cuz we did an episode of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Ring of Fates, which is that game was awful the garbage DS one Right.

486
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,989
Rym: Yeah, that was that we didn't even fit.

487
00:31:58,009 --> 00:31:58,631
Rym: We played like.

488
00:31:59,234 --> 00:32:04,310
Scott: I played it for like 10 minutes, but Like 30 or 40 dollars for a brand new game.

489
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,213
Rym: I gave it away.

490
00:32:05,233 --> 00:32:07,160
Rym: I remember giving it away cuz it was so bad.

491
00:32:07,401 --> 00:32:12,120
Rym: Yeah, that was only DS years around then for sure which makes sense because PC gaming was still pretty bad.

492
00:32:12,261 --> 00:32:13,894
Scott: Yeah, the DS was super new and geeked.

493
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:20,440
Scott: I started remember Yeah Like it was during beacon GeekNights when like you broke your DS fat as an excuse to get a DS light.

494
00:32:20,801 --> 00:32:30,969
Rym: in fact, I remember now I was working at IBM on co-op and I bought the the original DS Fat the day it came out.

495
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,160
Rym: Yeah, because we thought it might be a virtual boy.

496
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:34,585
Scott: Well, I mean, it's not.

497
00:32:34,646 --> 00:32:35,670
Scott: we thought it might be virtual boy.

498
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,055
Scott: It's worst case a virtual boy.

499
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,160
Scott: Otherwise, it's great.

500
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,974
Rym: Oh, here's something different.

501
00:32:40,418 --> 00:32:46,200
Rym: So 2008 was probably the peak era of us going to a lot of conventions.

502
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,340
Rym: Nowadays, we've actually cut almost all the non pecs is out of our lives.

503
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:54,315
Scott: I mean, it's just you know, the anime con 2008 did we go to?

504
00:32:54,355 --> 00:32:55,720
Rym: I think that was when we still went to Otakon.

505
00:32:55,861 --> 00:32:56,929
Scott: Yeah, well we would.

506
00:32:56,969 --> 00:32:58,239
Scott: last time I went to was oh nine.

507
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:02,872
Rym: yeah, so 2008 was when we still went to katsucon and Otakon.

508
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:09,232
Scott: and like anime next and Kinetic, I think we went to those cons back then.

509
00:33:09,292 --> 00:33:11,280
Scott: first of all, a lot of our people came with us.

510
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:18,960
Scott: Yeah, even if the con did not provide a lot to do We still had people there and ended up doing a lot of stuff and having a good time.

511
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,574
Scott: Yeah But then what happened is our other people stopped going to the cons.

512
00:33:23,594 --> 00:33:26,465
Scott: actually remember to say you would go to like we were still Going to like animate.

513
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,254
Scott: We stopped going to Otakon for other reasons.

514
00:33:28,295 --> 00:33:29,240
Scott: Otherwise, we would have kept going.

515
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,809
Rym: Yep, but we know we wouldn't stop though.

516
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:34,478
Scott: We sure but we kept going to anime Boston and it's like.

517
00:33:34,518 --> 00:33:35,000
Scott: but what happened?

518
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:40,614
Scott: it's because no one else was going really or very few people were going and What you know, we ended up like you walk around you go.

519
00:33:40,634 --> 00:33:41,459
Scott: There's artists all you go.

520
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,140
Scott: Do you assume you do your panels and you go to maybe a couple panels and the rest of the time?

521
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,455
Scott: It's like we're just hanging around in the area eating and not much.

522
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:56,762
Scott: I think the big difference Wasn't really worth it for us to make travel and put all this effort to something where we're just most of the time We're spent.

523
00:33:56,783 --> 00:33:59,900
Scott: we'd spend time literally like sitting around waiting for our panel to start.

524
00:34:00,181 --> 00:34:01,084
Scott: We got nothing to do.

525
00:34:01,285 --> 00:34:04,376
Rym: So I think 2008 was actually a pretty like by coincidence.

526
00:34:04,396 --> 00:34:04,798
Rym: That doesn't

527
00:34:04,818 --> 00:34:05,400
Scott: happen at PAX

528
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:07,770
Rym: Nope But 2008 by coincidence was

529
00:34:07,851 --> 00:34:09,560
Scott: all our people still go to bags pretty

530
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:16,518
Rym: Pivotal year for our lives and for gig nights because that was the first year we went to apex and I'm looking at all

531
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:17,465
Scott: this Correct

532
00:34:17,646 --> 00:34:22,344
Rym: and you noticed something very specific because 2008 it was in September.

533
00:34:22,364 --> 00:34:23,228
Rym: We went to that packs.

534
00:34:23,288 --> 00:34:27,520
Scott: We did three GeekNights episodes about packs in 2008.

535
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:35,130
Rym: Yep, but 2008 we did two episodes just about fucking Katsucon Because that was before we went to packs.

536
00:34:35,331 --> 00:34:36,599
Rym: We did Katsucon.

537
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,150
Rym: I think that might have been the last Katsucon we went to.

538
00:34:39,331 --> 00:34:41,120
Scott: I only went to not too many of them.

539
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,185
Rym: We're like three or four.

540
00:34:42,245 --> 00:34:45,480
Rym: I went to three before you started going to the one where I got sick.

541
00:34:45,821 --> 00:34:49,080
Rym: Yep, we went to it one before that and I would think we did one more and that was it.

542
00:34:49,241 --> 00:34:50,280
Scott: I don't remember any other one.

543
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:50,802
Rym: Those are the three.

544
00:34:50,822 --> 00:35:01,640
Rym: maybe one maybe one more but before we staffed and did like all our big panel Wasn't more than two is two or three because I went to three Katsucon's before you started going where I didn't even do panels.

545
00:35:02,244 --> 00:35:04,196
Rym: I just showed up like oh shit anime con.

546
00:35:04,216 --> 00:35:04,599
Rym: Let's go.

547
00:35:05,591 --> 00:35:16,731
Rym: but 2008 we went to packs and that was the year the fire nation attacked like everything changed like we came back from cat packs Giddy and literally told everyone we knew yeah, fuck every other kind.

548
00:35:16,772 --> 00:35:18,998
Rym: we go to you only packs is now and make this.

549
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:27,681
Rym: and That was the year where like the next year We brought more of our people to pax's and then it wasn't till 2010 that there was a people didn't really go with us To packs.

550
00:35:27,742 --> 00:35:28,263
Scott: Oh nine.

551
00:35:28,284 --> 00:35:29,729
Scott: It was still mostly just that.

552
00:35:29,749 --> 00:35:31,937
Rym: well because while we have a lot of friends.

553
00:35:31,977 --> 00:35:37,666
Rym: They're all East Coast We have the luxury of having the infinite money to go Not appear until 2010.

554
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:46,220
Rym: I believe in 2010 our Entire con crew that used to go to like Katsucon and Otakon with us.

555
00:35:46,702 --> 00:36:00,540
Rym: they all went to that packs that PAX East and Then after they went to that PAX East they basically all dropped all the other conventions like that year Like pretty much everyone we know stopped going to anime cons after they went to one packs.

556
00:36:00,983 --> 00:36:07,075
Rym: But then fast forward two years later They all stopped going to packs because PAX East is really hard to go.

557
00:36:07,095 --> 00:36:09,403
Scott: they went to pack season 2011 2012.

558
00:36:09,403 --> 00:36:13,033
Rym: people stopped going to pack because 2012 was the year you couldn't get hotels anymore.

559
00:36:13,114 --> 00:36:17,753
Scott: and then people go to mag fest though for Now I think some of them do at least you know.

560
00:36:17,793 --> 00:36:20,932
Scott: people on and off go to mag fest But I think everyone still wants to go to mag cuz.

561
00:36:21,073 --> 00:36:31,131
Rym: our like GeekNights Set like we have a set of people that go to the packs is with us, but the broader front row crew Really only goes to mag fest now and no other cons.

562
00:36:31,714 --> 00:36:32,537
Rym: I guess the only con.

563
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:33,360
Rym: we get our whole crew together.

564
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:41,372
Rym: That's a big change in our lives because Everyone we knew in our crew went to a lot of constant like.

565
00:36:41,392 --> 00:36:43,217
Rym: going to cons was a big part of our lives.

566
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:57,726
Scott: now Most of our friends have dropped all conventions from their lives except mag fest and when we go They're not doing panels or staffing like we are this so as an attendee and you know the time that you know They don't have a ton of money.

567
00:36:57,766 --> 00:36:59,055
Scott: They don't have infinite time.

568
00:36:59,095 --> 00:36:59,700
Scott: They're all adults.

569
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:04,096
Scott: Yeah, so the number of you know, do they really want to spend a weekend at a convention?

570
00:37:04,156 --> 00:37:05,080
Scott: unless that's you know.

571
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:09,378
Scott: Unless their staff some of them are staffers or people who run conventions and those people are going.

572
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:15,771
Scott: still true But if you know the ones who would just be attendees And aren't enforcers or anything.

573
00:37:15,811 --> 00:37:16,596
Scott: It's like why would they?

574
00:37:16,617 --> 00:37:17,120
Scott: I don't blame them.

575
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,548
Scott: They're doing what I would do if I was them But I didn't notice.

576
00:37:19,589 --> 00:37:24,820
Rym: it was interesting is that The main reason they all stopped going to PAX East was just that it was too hard to get a hotel.

577
00:37:25,345 --> 00:37:26,559
Rym: It was too much of a pain to go to it.

578
00:37:26,902 --> 00:37:27,990
Rym: The money wasn't even a factor.

579
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,340
Rym: was the pain in the ass that it was?

580
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:44,818
Scott: I mean it's if you if any of if anyone is not going if anyone I know is not going to PAX East simply because you're having trouble getting the hotel and the The badge and you just don't want to deal with the hassle But you're perfectly willing to spend the money and do the travel and stuff like that.

581
00:37:45,261 --> 00:37:48,602
Scott: Just let me know and I'll make it happen for you and I'll take the hassle away So you can come.

582
00:37:48,803 --> 00:37:55,379
Rym: actually I want you to be there because actually we are working on a strategy to make our PAX East experience be more like our mags.

583
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:02,231
Scott: We have a bunch of people who go to PAX West every year and we manage to buy a bunch of badges and get through The queue and get room somehow and yeah it works.

584
00:38:02,293 --> 00:38:06,177
Scott: so we can do the same thing for East to make sure you go if that's the thing you want to do.

585
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:17,560
Scott: if you if the Time and if the because I cannot do that only thing stopping you is the hassle and stuff and you don't care about the money Or the time then and you want to go then just let us know.

586
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:23,980
Rym: Yeah, cuz uh, but I worry that magfest will suffer the same fate if it starts to sell out in earnest.

587
00:38:24,901 --> 00:38:29,500
Rym: I feel like magfest is gonna start to be a real pain in the ass to go to in the coming years.

588
00:38:29,761 --> 00:38:35,019
Rym: Yeah, for normal people like if you have a hookup all counts are easy to go to is the problem?

589
00:38:36,842 --> 00:38:47,905
Scott: Yeah, you need that hookup these days, but one time we were on a vacation we were in some, you know, rando tiny hotel like a holiday and whatever kind of place that you stop on the highway and Maybe it was New Hampshire.

590
00:38:47,945 --> 00:38:50,236
Scott: I think we're in a hotel and you know, there's like that little.

591
00:38:50,376 --> 00:38:53,490
Scott: there's those magazines They have only in hotel rooms that tell you about the local shit.

592
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:54,835
Rym: Yeah, there's that little.

593
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,860
Rym: there's like all those little.

594
00:38:56,262 --> 00:38:59,180
Rym: There's also there's the little pamphlets by the entrance to the motel, right?

595
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,232
Scott: so there was a. there was one of those magazines.

596
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:09,167
Scott: in the hotel room is all kinds of advertisements for local stuff and one of them was for an RV lot where you could park your RV and it was like We got hookups.

597
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,879
Rym: and I was like.

598
00:39:11,261 --> 00:39:18,610
Scott: And I was like, you know, I guess I sort of knew that what they meant by we got hookups for you Know your electricity in your toilet in your water and stuff, right?

599
00:39:18,671 --> 00:39:21,644
Scott: But I was like, oh man, we got to go there You can get hooked up.

600
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:22,750
Rym: Yeah.

601
00:39:23,232 --> 00:39:23,514
Rym: Oh, man.

602
00:39:23,554 --> 00:39:24,620
Rym: I'm looking at these little geek guys episodes.

603
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,748
Rym: We're like really fucking pumped for katsu.

604
00:39:26,788 --> 00:39:29,819
Rym: Can we like keep talking about it was hype then.

605
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,286
Rym: Yeah Well Katsucon actually back then.

606
00:39:32,306 --> 00:39:34,152
Scott: now it's still exists.

607
00:39:34,192 --> 00:39:35,496
Scott: It's still a cosplay city there.

608
00:39:35,556 --> 00:39:36,800
Rym: It's basically a different con though.

609
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:41,160
Rym: Yeah, like it's called Katsucon, but it had a complete refresh of the staff.

610
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,630
Scott: It's in a different place with different staff with different stuff.

611
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:50,350
Rym: Like it's a different con because the old Katsucon Was more like magfest than like an anime con.

612
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,676
Scott: Well, it was much less gaming than mag.

613
00:39:52,796 --> 00:39:55,408
Rym: I had a free-to-play arcade though It was pretty fucking legit.

614
00:39:55,629 --> 00:39:56,595
Scott: Yeah, just small.

615
00:39:56,615 --> 00:39:59,907
Scott: It was like 10% of magfest arcade.

616
00:39:59,947 --> 00:40:04,400
Rym: Yeah, but it was a drunken 24/7 debaucherous con with a free-to-play arcade.

617
00:40:04,581 --> 00:40:06,226
Rym: Yeah, that sounds like magfest to me.

618
00:40:06,246 --> 00:40:07,952
Scott: It had those things.

619
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:11,703
Rym: Yeah, so how about 1998?

620
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:13,329
Rym: did you go to cons in 98?

621
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:16,521
Scott: I didn't even understand that a con existed in 1998.

622
00:40:16,521 --> 00:40:17,445
Rym: So I didn't know that.

623
00:40:17,766 --> 00:40:22,386
Scott: when I went in 2000 when the anime club started talking about cons I didn't really understand what they were talking about.

624
00:40:22,406 --> 00:40:24,615
Rym: I didn't know what an anime con was till 2002 when we went to one.

625
00:40:26,141 --> 00:40:28,655
Scott: I like oh, I know I understood before then but I didn't like.

626
00:40:28,695 --> 00:40:31,560
Scott: I didn't fully grasp Like what are they talking about going to this thing?

627
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,488
Scott: And I felt like whatever they were talking about.

628
00:40:33,508 --> 00:40:36,180
Scott: I'd understand it, but it was definitely not something that involved me.

629
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,367
Scott: It was something for someone else.

630
00:40:37,387 --> 00:40:41,400
Scott: Yep, and I ignored it mostly and whatever It's like I didn't know a con was a thing.

631
00:40:41,842 --> 00:40:46,700
Scott: The only thing I had been to ever at that point was a mad to the gathering tournament in a hotel, New Jersey.

632
00:40:47,082 --> 00:40:51,300
Rym: I used to actually go to a lot of gaming like I was going to gaming cons in middle school.

633
00:40:51,441 --> 00:40:55,438
Rym: So I was going to gaming cons and LAN parties in 98 Mm-hmm.

634
00:40:55,662 --> 00:41:02,297
Rym: I went to LAN parties all over the place like I'd bring my computer and play quake 2 or something or quake 1 something in the earliest ones.

635
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,933
Rym: or like we'd wire up our null modems do like the doom thing in a hotel.

636
00:41:06,953 --> 00:41:15,600
Rym: and I went to a lot of like Grognard asshole gaming cons where I'd sign up for a four-hour D&D session.

637
00:41:16,203 --> 00:41:17,470
Rym: Like that was what I did in 98 and in the 90s.

638
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:17,691
Rym: Mm-hmm.

639
00:41:20,143 --> 00:41:22,391
Scott: Yeah, so I was playing Pokemon in 1998.

640
00:41:22,391 --> 00:41:27,387
Scott: I was not playing Red.

641
00:41:27,467 --> 00:41:27,988
Scott: I had red one.

642
00:41:28,109 --> 00:41:28,530
Rym: actually 98.

643
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,933
Rym: I was still playing magic.

644
00:41:29,953 --> 00:41:32,059
Scott: a little bit is not playing magic.

645
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:33,810
Rym: in 98 I was playing magic.

646
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:34,960
Scott: I actually looked it up recently.

647
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,340
Scott: I was only playing magic for like two to three years in middle school.

648
00:41:38,721 --> 00:41:47,733
Rym: So in 1998, I was playing magic with all the people I knew who played magic when I originally played magic Tuesday episode.

649
00:41:47,753 --> 00:41:52,211
Rym: you somehow Politics, what were your 1998 politics?

650
00:41:52,271 --> 00:41:53,395
Scott: I didn't give a shit really.

651
00:41:53,415 --> 00:41:54,820
Scott: No, not at all.

652
00:41:55,042 --> 00:41:55,850
Scott: I didn't even know that.

653
00:41:55,891 --> 00:42:01,037
Scott: I mean, you know There are things that I believed generally which are a lot of the same things I believe now.

654
00:42:01,341 --> 00:42:03,370
Scott: But I didn't even know which was left and which was right.

655
00:42:03,471 --> 00:42:04,917
Scott: or the didn't see a Democrat or Republican.

656
00:42:04,917 --> 00:42:06,343
Scott: 1998 I would just.

657
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:08,771
Scott: I basically was like y'all politicians are fucking bullshit.

658
00:42:08,931 --> 00:42:09,513
Scott: They're all corrupt.

659
00:42:09,634 --> 00:42:11,359
Rym: assholes was wrong with your school.

660
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:16,333
Rym: Like in 1998, I was taking like poli sci classes in high school.

661
00:42:16,353 --> 00:42:20,425
Rym: Hmm, like serious ones I was I was actually getting.

662
00:42:20,445 --> 00:42:34,147
Scott: I was reading a lot of like Marx and Marx's literature and being mad about it because I mean I knew what communism was but it's like and what capitalism was but like, you know Didn't care too much in 1998.

663
00:42:34,147 --> 00:42:35,792
Rym: But that was what 10th grade.

664
00:42:35,812 --> 00:42:37,356
Rym: I wouldn't say 10th or 11th grade.

665
00:42:37,376 --> 00:42:38,500
Rym: I had a teacher.

666
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:40,180
Rym: I won't say his name.

667
00:42:40,988 --> 00:42:53,615
Scott: Looking back now I see the difference between The literature teacher who had us read Vonnegut and the social studies teacher who had a picture of Strom Thurmond on the wall Right now and nowadays looking back.

668
00:42:53,716 --> 00:42:54,480
Scott: I see the difference.

669
00:42:54,982 --> 00:42:56,850
Scott: But in the day, I was just.

670
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:59,240
Scott: it was just like oh this teacher really likes that.

671
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:03,280
Scott: You know congressperson who's the longest person who's been in Congress a long time.

672
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:03,742
Scott: So when

673
00:43:03,902 --> 00:43:18,299
Rym: I was a when I was it was either 1997 or 1998 when I was in 10th grade I had a teacher for social studies who took me and two other kids aside from the class one day like early in the air and He was like listen you three are the smart ones.

674
00:43:18,601 --> 00:43:19,885
Rym: so I think you're ready for this.

675
00:43:20,246 --> 00:43:29,799
Rym: and he gave us all a copy of the Communist Manifesto and a copy of the play Marx and Soho and said I want you to read these and Let's talk about him in a few weeks.

676
00:43:32,586 --> 00:43:37,850
Rym: That was a real interesting experience In 1998. say I guess you just didn't you weren't?

677
00:43:38,371 --> 00:43:39,935
Rym: you didn't think about politics in the 90s.

678
00:43:39,955 --> 00:43:41,520
Scott: No, I was playing games.

679
00:43:41,921 --> 00:43:49,504
Rym: I was kind of really invested in politics, but I didn't know a lot about like party Strategy at that time.

680
00:43:49,564 --> 00:43:52,754
Scott: I believed you should eliminate political parties, which I still sort of believe that

681
00:43:53,075 --> 00:43:58,219
Rym: I was very caught up in Libertarian ideas, but I got to put a big asterisk there because I

682
00:43:59,502 --> 00:44:00,690
Scott: learned about that until college

683
00:44:00,811 --> 00:44:11,987
Rym: because the way libertarianism was sold to me in the in the early to mid 90s was You shouldn't regulate things unless you have a good reason to and people should be free to do what they want Unless they hurt people.

684
00:44:12,008 --> 00:44:16,670
Rym: and I was like, yeah, I'm all for that But that is not what the libertarian party is all about.

685
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:18,035
Rym: They're basically just Republicans.

686
00:44:18,316 --> 00:44:21,031
Scott: Yes At least now they are.

687
00:44:21,394 --> 00:44:26,322
Rym: so how about 2008 politics got By then?

688
00:44:26,362 --> 00:44:29,353
Rym: you already had the opportunity to vote in multiple elections.

689
00:44:29,373 --> 00:44:31,180
Rym: I mean, did you vote?

690
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,663
Scott: Yes, did you?

691
00:44:32,723 --> 00:44:33,085
Scott: I voted.

692
00:44:33,165 --> 00:44:35,234
Scott: I voted every time I've been allowed to vote.

693
00:44:35,535 --> 00:44:36,700
Rym: Did you hold for Al Gore?

694
00:44:37,781 --> 00:44:38,062
Scott: Yes.

695
00:44:38,303 --> 00:44:38,423
Rym: Yep.

696
00:44:38,443 --> 00:44:39,126
Rym: I was in the year 2000.

697
00:44:39,126 --> 00:44:39,688
Scott: That was not in the year 2008.

698
00:44:39,688 --> 00:44:44,105
Rym: All right, so 2008 I guess you were active.

699
00:44:44,867 --> 00:44:45,690
Rym: you cared about politics.

700
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:47,376
Rym: Was there any issue you particularly cared about in 2008?

701
00:44:47,376 --> 00:44:47,597
Rym: copyright?

702
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,573
Rym: Yeah, that is something that has definitely changed for us in 98.

703
00:44:52,573 --> 00:45:16,899
Rym: I was More mad about copyright than I was about fucking anything Yes and also I was really mad about Richard Solomon style stuff like 1998. Rym was so fucking mad about open source software and about freedom of the internet and free speech on the internet and Copyright on the internet and remixing and DRM and CBD PPA type stuff.

704
00:45:16,899 --> 00:45:21,929
Rym: 2008 Rym Was still almost equally mad about all that stuff.

705
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:25,260
Rym: and now 2018 Rym just doesn't give a fuck because that is like.

706
00:45:25,361 --> 00:45:27,100
Scott: I think we were also at that point.

707
00:45:27,181 --> 00:45:28,840
Scott: I was also mad about.

708
00:45:28,922 --> 00:45:36,667
Scott: I Started to care about some New York State level stuff because we were voting to give more money to the MTA on the referendum and we lost.

709
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:43,299
Scott: yeah Even though I voted yes, and if we had voted yes, then maybe we wouldn't be yelling about the subway being shitty.

710
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:43,420
Scott: now.

711
00:45:43,701 --> 00:45:46,751
Rym: Yep, the problem is the people at the vote in that.

712
00:45:46,932 --> 00:45:49,300
Scott: well we were upstate and voting on you know what that's that was.

713
00:45:49,521 --> 00:45:54,180
Rym: That was an awakening I had because 2008 was when I was aging toward moving into the city.

714
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,839
Scott: Like I don't know if it was exactly 2008 that vote with that era.

715
00:45:57,081 --> 00:45:59,592
Rym: It was around then plus or minus two years in the direction.

716
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:01,260
Rym: That was right before we moved to the city.

717
00:46:01,401 --> 00:46:02,859
Scott: It was well, it must have been too early.

718
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,856
Scott: It was either earlier or it was 2008 at the latest

719
00:46:05,561 --> 00:46:28,460
Rym: but I guess that was an error when I was using Metro North and That was when I had an awakening in state-level politics in the sense that I Recognized the problems that upstate New York was causing for New York City And I started to be real mad about it as I started to learn how New York State was structured Because up to that point I still knew more about Michigan politics than I did about New York politics.

720
00:46:28,942 --> 00:46:32,820
Rym: Cuz I moped by the 2008 era I mostly cared about federal politics.

721
00:46:33,201 --> 00:46:40,367
Rym: That was the era when I started to actually care about the details of state and county Legislation in the place I lived.

722
00:46:40,448 --> 00:46:43,719
Scott: well, it's like they'd never really taught me in school or anything before.

723
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:47,310
Scott: I was like Oh, I have to vote for state legislators.

724
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:48,574
Scott: That's who this person is.

725
00:46:48,594 --> 00:46:49,817
Scott: Oh, I get it.

726
00:46:49,837 --> 00:46:50,720
Scott: There's another.

727
00:46:51,783 --> 00:47:03,540
Scott: Yeah, I didn't fully grasp Until I had to vote for it 2018 and I didn't vote for it when I was you know When I technically was getting like absentee Connecticut ballots, I wasn't voting for that shit.

728
00:47:04,264 --> 00:47:07,020
Scott: It wasn't until you know went to New York that I was voting for that.

729
00:47:07,221 --> 00:47:20,865
Rym: but I guess the difference is I cared a lot about all these technology issues in like 2008 and Frankly in 2018 like while I still care about all those things There are way more important things to deal with right now Like I did not.

730
00:47:21,467 --> 00:47:25,180

Rym: We watch Lupin at midnight for a little while.

771
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,049
Scott: I think we watch like Simpsons two times.

772
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:14,057
Rym: Yeah, but then that was when The Simpsons got bad.

773
00:49:14,178 --> 00:49:17,887
Scott: Yeah, and Nowadays, actually I thought he's having a 2008.

774
00:49:17,887 --> 00:49:19,131
Scott: That's why I started talking.

775
00:49:19,151 --> 00:49:19,291
Rym: So 2008.

776
00:49:19,291 --> 00:49:19,652
Rym: Yeah, 2008.

777
00:49:19,652 --> 00:49:20,956
Rym: I was talking about Netflix DVDs.

778
00:49:20,956 --> 00:49:22,604
Scott: 2008.

779
00:49:22,604 --> 00:49:26,795
Rym: I was only watching two things Netflix DVDs and anime fan subs.

780
00:49:26,875 --> 00:49:32,438
Scott: I was also Occasionally streaming some sports, but it was very hard to watch sports in 2008.

781
00:49:32,438 --> 00:49:36,066
Scott: Yeah, I pretty 98 guys like Formula One races in 98.

782
00:49:36,066 --> 00:49:40,299
Rym: I really watched and cared about hockey a lot.

783
00:49:40,299 --> 00:49:41,986
Rym: 2008.

784
00:49:41,986 --> 00:49:44,139
Rym: I wasn't paying that much attention because it was hard to watch.

785
00:49:44,139 --> 00:49:45,347
Rym: 2018.

786
00:49:45,347 --> 00:49:48,226
Scott: I'm really watching Sports I was watching.

787
00:49:48,306 --> 00:49:55,889
Scott: most actually were football because it was easy to get watch Formula one because people had a good way of bit torrenting it.

788
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:59,600
Scott: Yeah, and actually baseball because the Mets were less bad.

789
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:09,680
Scott: That's that's around the time where the Mets made the playoffs and I bought playoff tickets and then in the final game of the Season they missed the playoffs and then I had to get refund on the tickets.

790
00:50:10,061 --> 00:50:13,820
Scott: I guess I went this interesting transformation where I forget if that was those seven or eight that happened.

791
00:50:14,042 --> 00:50:20,443
Rym: I didn't really watch a lot of serial quote-unquote television in the in that middle era around 2008.

792
00:50:20,443 --> 00:50:28,146
Rym: But now with Netflix, I'm actually watching a lot of shows again Like a lot of shows between Netflix and Hulu and crunchyroll and all these things I rotate through and

793
00:50:28,769 --> 00:50:29,473
Scott: I think the main

794
00:50:29,533 --> 00:50:37,220
Rym: reason I'm watching a lot of stuff Is that I don't have to go through the hassle of pirating it and I can watch it legally without ads.

795
00:50:39,983 --> 00:50:40,953
Rym: Alright, I think we killed enough time.
