00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,627
Rym: It's Wednesday February 21st 2018.

2
00:00:10,627 --> 00:00:13,916
Rym: I'm Rym, I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:16,341 --> 00:00:18,138
Rym: devil man crybaby.

4
00:00:22,182 --> 00:00:22,893
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:34,050
Rym: So I know it's a trope on the last decade plus a GeekNights for us to comment on the weather and say things like warm today, but It's warm today.

6
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,041
Scott: I'm like it's February 2021st.

7
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:39,589
Rym: and it's what 79 out there right now.

8
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:39,850
Scott: I don't know.

9
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,633
Scott: It's 79.

10
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:41,195
Scott: I might be sick.

11
00:00:41,235 --> 00:00:43,003
Rym: My phone says it is 79.

12
00:00:43,003 --> 00:00:51,623
Scott: It might be 69. nice, yeah, but the Yeah, I was wearing t-shirt today walking around No code.

13
00:00:51,663 --> 00:00:56,660
Rym: I went out and took a nap over lunch in the park, but just sucks that it's only a one-day deal.

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,358
Scott: It's gonna go back to being cold again at least for a while.

15
00:00:59,378 --> 00:01:07,019
Rym: Yep It was someone pointed out that it was 74 like at lunchtime and tomorrow it's gonna be four to seven Which is still unseasonably warm.

16
00:01:07,425 --> 00:01:10,306
Rym: It's too cold But that is unseasonably warm.

17
00:01:10,366 --> 00:01:14,519
Rym: and yet apparently today broke like all-time records for hot in New York.

18
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,607
Scott: good Let's keep it broken.

19
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:16,816
Rym: break them all.

20
00:01:16,857 --> 00:01:22,717
Rym: Yep Warming in New York only as much as the weather was not ideal the previous week when I was skin.

21
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:23,298
Rym: It's done.

22
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:27,082
Rym: now I look all the mountains are like Steaming.

23
00:01:27,263 --> 00:01:28,005
Rym: it's so hot.

24
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:28,947
Rym: He's go.

25
00:01:28,968 --> 00:01:31,254
Rym: skiing is basically done for the season based on this.

26
00:01:31,554 --> 00:01:31,875
Scott: Oh good.

27
00:01:31,996 --> 00:01:37,960
Scott: You will not die from skiing in 2017 or early 18 or I could go anyway die in late.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,806
Rym: So there is a thing.

29
00:01:38,846 --> 00:01:44,155
Rym: there's a concept called spring skiing Which is basically you go skiing and like shorts and a t-shirt.

30
00:01:44,376 --> 00:01:45,260
Scott: on what fake snow?

31
00:01:46,102 --> 00:01:46,623
Rym: So they're.

32
00:01:46,804 --> 00:01:53,040
Rym: usually there's such a base layer of snow on the mountain like feet of it that it'll be snowy into April.

33
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:54,852
Rym: It'll just be wet.

34
00:01:54,933 --> 00:01:55,899
Scott: What are you gonna be mush?

35
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,460
Rym: Yeah, you ski on mush down like the few runs that are left and usually you people have different words for different regions.

36
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,443
Rym: But there's the thing that crazy people do at the end of the season where at the end of the day They'll turn on lights.

37
00:02:08,326 --> 00:02:09,892
Rym: Oh, if it's dark or they'll just do it.

38
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:10,895
Scott: lights melt the snow more.

39
00:02:11,478 --> 00:02:11,880
Rym: who cares?

40
00:02:12,662 --> 00:02:13,810
Rym: Not more than the Sun.

41
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,938
Scott: I guess not.

42
00:02:15,662 --> 00:02:26,950
Rym: If you have a light that'll melt the snow more than the Sun on a wide area And what you'll do is you'll ski down like the last remaining area and Then there'll be the water at the bottom of the mountain.

43
00:02:27,574 --> 00:02:28,760
Scott: you jump in like a swimming pool.

44
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,400
Rym: The contest is how far can you get over the water before you sink into the water?

45
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:40,620
Scott: I mean if it's safe water, yeah actually sounds safer than regular skiing because you end in some nice safe water and not in a tree.

46
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,620
Rym: Yeah, it's but you're wearing shorts in the t-shirt instead of all that gear.

47
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,283
Scott: What else?

48
00:02:45,383 --> 00:02:47,634
Scott: what else are you gonna wear to go in water?

49
00:02:47,654 --> 00:02:52,052
Rym: We're bathing suit Yeah, but you're not flying into the water at high spells your water skiing.

50
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:55,479
Scott: if you fly into the tree at high speed It don't matter what you're wearing.

51
00:02:56,361 --> 00:02:58,832
Scott: Yeah, your winter jacket ain't gonna save your ribbies.

52
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,500
Rym: be good enough to not hit the trees.

53
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,945
Rym: That's what gladeskings all about.

54
00:03:02,387 --> 00:03:03,672
Scott: looks like it hit the tree.

55
00:03:03,872 --> 00:03:05,819
Scott: That's actually Microsoft Golf not ski free.

56
00:03:09,124 --> 00:03:11,563
Rym: So, yeah, uh Got any news.

57
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:16,600
Scott: I do have a news and I'd say this would be a Tuesday news since it's a gaming news.

58
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:22,080
Scott: But I associate this particular game much more with the anime community in the gaming community, right?

59
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,571
Rym: I mean we played this game at the Anime anime club at RIT.

60
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:28,480
Rym: So is the anime club at purview over there?

61
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,080
Scott: There are two main games basically from the college days.

62
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:47,060
Scott: Right that were the top games and the only reason we don't continue to play these games the exclusion of all else is simply because it's Too difficult right and those games are dance dance revolution and tribes - yep Right battle check is like bringing up the third place.

63
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,700
Scott: Yeah, we could continue to play these games if we really put a lot of effort into it.

64
00:03:52,082 --> 00:04:09,420
Scott: Actually the world shit that we finally got a world champion of DDR from America cuz konami Delivered like the newest best DDR machines to a few places Yeah, and those people like that guy just kept going to like, you know Like the Dave and Busters or whatever where he lives and kept putting quarters in that machine until we're sliding his card in that machine.

65
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:16,920
Rym: But DDR much like say counter-strike or tribes - is an elegant weapon from a more civilized era.

66
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:19,005
Rym: Right, it's pretty archaic.

67
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:28,578
Scott: Yeah, so, you know, I was very very excited like bright more excited Than to see this than I have seen than anything in a very long time.

68
00:04:28,598 --> 00:04:29,863
Rym: now It's worth telling.

69
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:32,792
Rym: this is exciting in a way that all the other.

70
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:39,233
Rym: Oh, this is better than DDR games like Para-para or just dance or any of those things.

71
00:04:39,594 --> 00:04:41,159
Rym: Those are not the same kind of thing is that?

72
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:41,440
Scott: no?

73
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,701
Scott: So I saw videos of this on Twitter and YouTube and I was like, oh my god We.

74
00:04:46,862 --> 00:04:49,290
Scott: I am so glad to be alive in 2017 at the.

75
00:04:49,812 --> 00:05:11,654
Scott: at the konami arcade championships I think they announced this new game called dance rush and this game is basically the current greatest technology of the money and it shows you why the money for whatever evil they are and Konami whatever is still the greatest at making rhythm games over all others because

76
00:05:11,755 --> 00:05:12,537
Rym: unlike this thing is

77
00:05:12,597 --> 00:05:13,800
Scott: increasing is a miracle.

78
00:05:14,043 --> 00:05:15,519
Scott: I can't believe they came up with this.

79
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:16,105
Scott: I won't.

80
00:05:16,347 --> 00:05:22,540
Scott: if I had money in space I would buy this two of these machines and like get rid of my bed and just put him in the bedroom.

81
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,409
Rym: I mean not to get into.

82
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:39,059
Rym: I mean, it's not Tuesday so not to go too deep into game stuff, but the reason why we're so obsessed with dance dance revolution over other similar games is That it was a very technical objective and explicit like dancing happened But I'm making a quote motion around it.

83
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,700
Rym: But really it was a game of move your feet to touch these four buttons based on a pattern that we're showing you.

84
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,135
Scott: Yes, and the day just happened to be large buttons under your feet.

85
00:05:48,155 --> 00:05:49,100
Scott: So you have to step on them.

86
00:05:49,220 --> 00:06:00,880
Rym: so the fun of it was that it was a very technically difficult game and Any dancing you could do or style was sort of tempered by the fact that you got to actually perform these motions very?

87
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,609
Rym: explicitly and specifically most dancing games focus more on.

88
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:17,660
Rym: You can't memorize a pattern and do that pattern perfectly unless you just straight-up dance And even then they tend to be much more subjective and much more restrictive on what you do.

89
00:06:17,981 --> 00:06:19,867
Scott: So this is anyway this new game dance rush.

90
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:23,400
Scott: instead of this pad with four arrows or pumped case five arrows.

91
00:06:23,701 --> 00:06:27,333
Scott: This is just this big flat surface with a shit ton of lights under it.

92
00:06:27,394 --> 00:06:29,180
Rym: There was the DDR that has six arrows.

93
00:06:29,401 --> 00:06:30,285
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

94
00:06:30,305 --> 00:06:33,620
Scott: This is just a shit ton of lights and it's just a big flat surface.

95
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:48,025
Scott: Also, no rail whatsoever, yeah Standing on the dance floor and it's a light-up disco dance floor and it lights up with the rhythm To give you disco power.

96
00:06:48,406 --> 00:06:51,936
Scott: and then the music plays and I saw videos of this.

97
00:06:52,217 --> 00:06:53,380
Scott: There were two kinds of videos.

98
00:06:53,480 --> 00:07:04,716
Scott: I saw people playing this game one kind people actually dancing who knew how to dance and It seemed like they were getting a good score at the game Even though they were actually dancing like you wouldn't think they were playing a game.

99
00:07:05,298 --> 00:07:10,560
Scott: and to Someone who is clearly just trying to hit the arrows or the quote arrows, right?

100
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:16,860
Scott: Just trying just to do the instructions to get points and not trying to do any style whatsoever.

101
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:32,400
Scott: And even the person who was only trying to do what was necessary to score points and get a high score at this game Looked like they were dancing Does with less energy than the people who are unskilled and the people who are actually dancing.

102
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:35,960
Scott: When you play DDR just score points, you do not look like you're dancing.

103
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,713
Scott: You look like you are squatting leaning and stomping rapidly now.

104
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,740
Rym: It is still impressive in its own way.

105
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:51,239
Scott: Yes so here are some videos showing you how the game works and some people playing it very very well and I want to play this so bad.

106
00:07:51,601 --> 00:08:07,213
Scott: Here the music and also the game has a camera in it and it takes a video of you doing your dance Which I guess encourages you to dance well, and then also adds like these cute little visual effects to the video Yeah Like little sparks jumping out of your feet and shit like that to make it extra fun.

107
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:18,479
Scott: and you can also see how the dance Floor lights up as you play, you know Because some of those effects are added in post by the video and some of them are actually the dance floor Being the best dance floor ever created in the history of man.

108
00:08:19,842 --> 00:08:20,948
Scott: Too bad, I don't speak Japanese.

109
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:21,993
Scott: Maybe we can go work at Bimani.

110
00:08:22,013 --> 00:08:29,976
Rym: Yeah, I Only bemoan the fact that the Golden Age of Bimani in arcades in the u.s.

111
00:08:30,457 --> 00:08:35,999
Rym: Died around 2006 mmm, so I don't know where or when we'll have an opportunity to play this.

112
00:08:37,621 --> 00:08:39,005
Rym: Maybe actually magfests.

113
00:08:39,405 --> 00:08:44,560
Rym: DDR machines this year were a pale imitation of even like the last five mag.

114
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:52,205
Rym: What's really disappointing right is that all the DDR machines they had were these sort of like bullshitty bootleg ones with crazy latency that barely worked.

115
00:08:52,306 --> 00:08:58,264
Scott: but something is really disappointing actually in that in the rhythm game department is that Getting into kpop.

116
00:08:58,364 --> 00:09:01,834
Scott: There's these pump-it-up machines actually have like.

117
00:09:02,014 --> 00:09:08,334
Scott: they're updated with the newest kpop So frequently like and it's like they get the music videos in there and shit.

118
00:09:08,374 --> 00:09:09,136
Scott: and it's like whoa.

119
00:09:09,196 --> 00:09:17,799
Scott: if you like kpops Suddenly all your favorite songs are in this machine, and it's constantly always like a song comes out And it'll be in there right away.

120
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:18,780
Scott: It's incredible.

121
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:25,840
Scott: But the arrows that you have to step on are nothing like the actual official choreographies for those songs.

122
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:30,071
Rym: And that's just well because that's the teardown from that.

123
00:09:30,171 --> 00:09:33,220
Rym: is the pop in music of yeah, just fucking button.

124
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,467
Scott: We're just making giant buttons and subtle little ones.

125
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,657
Rym: hit him with your hand hit the buttons, and we're gonna play these.

126
00:09:38,737 --> 00:09:42,428
Scott: beat mania Retends to look like a DJ console.

127
00:09:42,468 --> 00:09:44,415
Rym: Yeah, oh my god.

128
00:09:44,475 --> 00:09:45,760
Rym: I just want to play this right now.

129
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,768
Rym: This is I feel that feeling because you guys don't understand I can tell.

130
00:09:48,808 --> 00:09:49,600
Scott: just looking at it.

131
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,510
Scott: This is the greatest dancing video game machine that has ever been.

132
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,613
Scott: there was an era as of 2018.

133
00:09:53,613 --> 00:10:02,060
Rym: there was an era Or at one point one of our friends said yo I heard there's a DDR machine at some arcade somewhere.

134
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:08,878
Rym: We'd get in cars and go there to check it out And it wouldn't be there because there was no way to know short of just driving there and looking.

135
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:16,828
Rym: yep There was a rumor for like a year that the arcade and campus was gonna get a DDR machine And then one day it got one.

136
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,237
Rym: No it got a broken fucking pump-it-up machine.

137
00:10:19,258 --> 00:10:26,160
Rym: all right Because I remember one of us wrote DDR on a piece of paper and taped it over the side anyway.

138
00:10:27,422 --> 00:10:33,919
Rym: So in a very very brief news Me and Emily will put the show on the patreon because Scott didn't see it.

139
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,560
Rym: But to give the summary the TLDR version of my geek bite for Black Panther.

140
00:10:39,822 --> 00:10:42,393
Rym: It's my second favorite Marvel movie easily.

141
00:10:42,413 --> 00:10:47,620
Rym: It's real good and You should probably see it even if you don't care about Marvel movies.

142
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,784
Rym: I've never seen a Marvel movie.

143
00:10:48,825 --> 00:10:49,607
Rym: never read a comic book.

144
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:56,613
Rym: don't know who spider-man is because it literally has no Meaningful connection to the Marvel Universe that you need to know to watch it.

145
00:10:56,693 --> 00:11:00,919
Rym: It is just an afrofuturism Extravaganza, and it's real good.

146
00:11:05,885 --> 00:11:08,500
Rym: but anyway things of the day.

147
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:17,988
Rym: so some of you follow me on Twitter might have noticed that I did start working on that utenna analysis show again because In the period where we weren't working on it.

148
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:19,011
Rym: Holy shit.

149
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:22,400
Rym: Do I get a lot of comments and messages on YouTube?

150
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,965
Rym: They're like hey, where's this like?

151
00:11:24,005 --> 00:11:28,220
Rym: is this coming back and those videos actually getting a lot of views?

152
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:29,063
Rym: Mm-hmm.

153
00:11:29,405 --> 00:11:32,540
Rym: and also when I started pre-production of the next episode.

154
00:11:33,602 --> 00:11:39,059
Rym: The episode that we're gonna do next is the one where nanami turns into a cow.

155
00:11:39,462 --> 00:11:42,020
Rym: Okay, the dona dona dona episode.

156
00:11:42,341 --> 00:11:49,660
Rym: It's probably the second most famous episode among weebs who are trying to tell people about how crazy your tenant gets after the curry episode.

157
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:59,900
Rym: hmm, it's one of those nanami episodes and Watching it for this analysis and doing the things the dona dona dona song you've probably heard it.

158
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,320
Rym: It's actually a pretty like long-standing kind of famous folk song.

159
00:12:03,922 --> 00:12:20,300
Rym: It's in the show in Japanese, but if you want here is Joan Baez Performing the English version of the dona dona dona song Which is basically in the show about nanami and toga selling her out by way of selling out feminism.

160
00:12:20,421 --> 00:12:21,571
Rym: But anyway, I digress.

161
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:22,438
Rym: This is a pretty good song.

162
00:12:23,662 --> 00:12:25,715
Scott: Okay, so also speaking of music.

163
00:12:25,816 --> 00:12:33,278
Scott: right recently There was a Twitter thread going down talking about Milli Vanilli and I thought I knew the story of Milli Vanilli and I did know the story of Milli Vanilli.

164
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:42,874
Scott: everything in That thread was stuff that I already knew except there was a connection between Milli Vanilli and Boney M that I was not aware of.

165
00:12:42,975 --> 00:12:44,403
Scott: all the rest of the story I knew already.

166
00:12:44,423 --> 00:12:47,756
Rym: Scott messaged me this and I had to go confirm cuz I didn't really believe it.

167
00:12:47,776 --> 00:12:48,660
Rym: It just seemed to.

168
00:12:50,662 --> 00:12:53,694
Rym: It seemed like the kind of lie you would tell me to get me excited about.

169
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:58,031
Scott: so I did not know about this one Connection right between Boney M and Milli Vanilli.

170
00:12:58,051 --> 00:13:00,400
Scott: so you can find that thread on Twitter somewhere if you search for it.

171
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,490
Scott: Maybe Rym will put a link somewhere if he finds it.

172
00:13:02,812 --> 00:13:04,460
Scott: I wasn't gonna put the effort in to find it.

173
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:19,355
Scott: Anyway, here is my thing of the day, which is related not to Milli Vanilli, but yes to Boney M. Obviously we are fans of Boney M because of the song rah rah Rasputin Specifically because of a Rasputin because of a remix of it.

174
00:13:19,435 --> 00:13:33,480
Scott: in this old internet game There was a flash game called name that beard and when you had to name rest when you had to guess Rasputin's beard They played a remix of Rasputin and I cannot find that remix on the internet anywhere.

175
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:36,268
Rym: But anyway, I think I found name.

176
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:45,086
Scott: that being that beard is one of the earliest GeekNights things of the day, by the way So that I'm not gonna link to the flash.

177
00:13:45,106 --> 00:13:47,276
Scott: Someone made a YouTube video of it of them.

178
00:13:47,316 --> 00:13:50,028
Scott: Just playing the It's got no likes.

179
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,458
Rym: I'm the first person to like this video anyway.

180
00:13:55,681 --> 00:14:01,858
Scott: So my thing of the day is this organ this really really old organ the musical kind not the body kind.

181
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:07,940
Scott: and This organ is a player organ, you know, you feed paper into it with cutouts and that's how it plays music automatically.

182
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,620
Scott: Cuz you know organs got a lot of keyboards.

183
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,589
Scott: It's hard for one person to play all of them at once.

184
00:14:11,609 --> 00:14:15,950
Scott: so you can get a lot better music out of it by controlling Because an organ is special right.

185
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,020
Scott: you can play literally every key at once.

186
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,044
Scott: It's a pipe for every key.

187
00:14:19,064 --> 00:14:19,426
Scott: You can play.

188
00:14:19,466 --> 00:14:22,660
Rym: the whole well depends on how much air capacity behind.

189
00:14:22,741 --> 00:14:24,620
Scott: Yeah, but the point is you can't.

190
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:36,940
Scott: Ten fingers are not enough to play the organ to its maximum capacity is what I'm saying Right, which is why you can get better music if you feed, you know use some mechanics to control the organ, right?

191
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:45,940
Scott: This organ is so old that it is old as Actual Rasputin and it is playing the song rah rah Rasputin.

192
00:14:47,384 --> 00:14:56,636
Scott: So he could have Gone and listened to the music from this machine which would later then play a 1970s disco song about himself.

193
00:14:57,498 --> 00:15:02,020
Rym: I Always wonder what someone like that like with the ma with with modern knowledge.

194
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:07,015
Rym: What were Ross routine think of his legacy of what we think of him?

195
00:15:07,035 --> 00:15:07,055
Rym: I?

196
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,857
Scott: Mean, I'm pretty sure he'd be happy to be thought of at all.

197
00:15:14,017 --> 00:15:14,663
Rym: In The meta moment.

198
00:15:14,884 --> 00:15:20,908
Rym: the book club book is the Odyssey by Homa Translated by Emily Wilson.

199
00:15:20,928 --> 00:15:21,631
Rym: I started reading it.

200
00:15:22,113 --> 00:15:23,420
Scott: I read the introduction of art.

201
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,391
Rym: The introduction part is way good.

202
00:15:25,531 --> 00:15:27,644
Rym: Do not skip the introduction You got.

203
00:15:27,664 --> 00:15:29,880
Scott: when people be reading books, they're always skipping shit.

204
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,972
Scott: The most notorious thing is people read watchman.

205
00:15:32,012 --> 00:15:33,300
Scott: don't read the not comic part.

206
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:36,515
Scott: Yeah, when you read a book you got to read all the parts.

207
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:37,520
Scott: You got to read the intro.

208
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,149
Scott: You got to read the four waves of sky.

209
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:40,275
Scott: we gotta read the epilogue.

210
00:15:40,295 --> 00:15:42,989
Rym: when you read homestuck You got to read all those chat logs.

211
00:15:43,211 --> 00:15:44,176
Scott: That's why I just don't read home.

212
00:15:44,216 --> 00:15:52,482
Scott: Yep When you read a prince of nothing you got to read a glossary, yeah Anything.

213
00:15:52,783 --> 00:15:56,879
Rym: I skipped over all the entries in the glossary that were so and so.

214
00:15:57,442 --> 00:16:00,380
Scott: Man of the crew of the at least had to look at him to skip them.

215
00:16:00,641 --> 00:16:02,868
Scott: Yeah, I had more than a paragraph though got read.

216
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,480
Rym: so and so man of the circumfix a glossary is on the borderline.

217
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,227
Scott: You don't have to read a bibliography.

218
00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:11,480
Scott: You don't have to read an excerpt from another work by the same author.

219
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,629
Scott: That's basically just an ad.

220
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:18,770
Scott: you don't have to read the Table of contents, although that's not a bad idea.

221
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,080
Scott: Yeah, I guess you should probably read the dedication.

222
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,286
Scott: It'll take you half a second.

223
00:16:22,969 --> 00:16:24,316
Rym: I've seen some long dedications.

224
00:16:24,457 --> 00:16:28,787
Scott: Don't read those Self-aggrandizement, it's usually the sign of a bad book too.

225
00:16:29,408 --> 00:16:39,320
Rym: But the introduction and Emily Wilson's, please don't call me out on that Odyssey is Really really good and you'll miss a bunch of stuff that you wouldn't have thought about if you don't read it.

226
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:43,660
Scott: Well, I mean cuz you know, it's something that's ancient and studied like, you know in Greek mythologies.

227
00:16:43,983 --> 00:16:46,200
Scott: I don't have Greek mythology knowledge background.

228
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:52,140
Scott: So that intro is there to help me, you know, read it with the eye of someone who knows at least something.

229
00:16:52,301 --> 00:16:56,320
Scott: Well, it most like you go reading the Odyssey and you're like, what is Troy?

230
00:16:57,542 --> 00:16:59,267
Scott: Then it's probably not gonna be the same.

231
00:16:59,608 --> 00:16:59,849
Scott: Yeah.

232
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:03,420
Rym: Well, I'm kind of assuming the average GeekNights listener at least knows that much.

233
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,343
Rym: I'm more focused on.

234
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:05,066
Scott: I hope you.

235
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:07,071
Scott: I hope so, but some people don't.

236
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,319
Rym: you gotta at least know about Lega Lamna.

237
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:11,373
Scott: I love Lega.

238
00:17:11,393 --> 00:17:12,198
Scott: That's my guy.

239
00:17:13,182 --> 00:17:32,887
Rym: but there the context it gives that's important is sort of around why this translation is interesting and Why the concepts that we ascribe to characters in an ancient story may not be Necessarily correct to the way that story might have been read in its time.

240
00:17:32,907 --> 00:17:33,549
Rym: Hmm.

241
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,258
Rym: See also Shakespeare and how Shakespeare was actually performed.

242
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:37,799
Scott: Mm-hmm.

243
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,860
Rym: Otherwise a bunch of our videos are on YouTube including the judge anime by its cover for the winter season.

244
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:46,550
Rym: Soon an episode of spring season.

245
00:17:46,831 --> 00:17:49,400
Rym: Yeah soon the spring season as we did the winner one a bit late.

246
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:52,090
Scott: So, you know the spring one, let's see.

247
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:57,050
Scott: We're maybe like halfway through the winter season already Maybe like six weeks seven weeks from now.

248
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,095
Scott: We'll do the spring season.

249
00:17:58,155 --> 00:17:58,697
Rym: Yep soon.

250
00:17:58,717 --> 00:18:00,504
Rym: We'll have a new ten I don't know.

251
00:18:00,584 --> 00:18:13,790
Rym: We got a bunch of panels like our panels from magfest panels from back south And now we're gonna be doing at PAX East 2018 on Sunday morning The 40 tabletop games you must play.

252
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:15,396
Rym: we tried it out at magfest.

253
00:18:15,436 --> 00:18:16,400
Rym: It was a crazy success.

254
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:17,785
Rym: I'm changing the list.

255
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,914
Scott: you make a clickbait title for a panel.

256
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:20,657
Scott: They'll accept it.

257
00:18:20,677 --> 00:18:22,829
Rym: get right on Completely filled the room.

258
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:23,654
Rym: the video.

259
00:18:23,695 --> 00:18:25,064
Rym: people are cheering I guess.

260
00:18:25,144 --> 00:18:29,506
Scott: I guess if you do it at a panel with a clickbait title It becomes a seat bait or a sit bait.

261
00:18:29,707 --> 00:18:34,120
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what kind of bait but what if you're on stage a masturbate?

262
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,148
Rym: No, I mean, we're basically just literally.

263
00:18:37,168 --> 00:18:40,179
Rym: the panel is hey, here's 40 games that we thought of.

264
00:18:41,082 --> 00:18:45,140
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, I think the thing is is that rather than you know, you're just doing a list, right?

265
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,804
Scott: It's sort of like.

266
00:18:45,845 --> 00:18:47,980
Scott: what's the point of coming to this panel, right?

267
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,920
Scott: But the point is is that we can use this unlike other people who bait you just to get ad money, right?

268
00:18:53,161 --> 00:19:00,467
Scott: We're basically like, okay We just make a vehicle to get asses and seats and then basically when we talk about the game We learn you something you can teach.

269
00:19:00,527 --> 00:19:09,420
Scott: we can basically each game when we think you know Think about it for a second like oh here is the thing to actually learn quality content about this game.

270
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,005
Scott: Yeah, let's go to the next game.

271
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,272
Scott: Oh, this game has this clever mechanic.

272
00:19:13,313 --> 00:19:15,560
Scott: Let me teach you about it and why it is interesting.

273
00:19:16,123 --> 00:19:18,720
Rym: It's interesting watching the video of us doing the trial.

274
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:20,880
Scott: It's really less it's you know.

275
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:23,880
Scott: On the one hand the panel is like here's a list of 40 board games.

276
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,586
Scott: You could you that are really a plus.

277
00:19:25,606 --> 00:19:27,412
Scott: you should play them maybe sort of.

278
00:19:27,914 --> 00:19:35,119
Scott: but really what it is is We're gonna go down this list of 40 board games and it's basically learn 40 lessons about board games from right?

279
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,516
Scott: That's what it really is.

280
00:19:37,523 --> 00:19:41,568
Rym: so yeah, we'll see you at PAX East and Follow us on YouTube and all our stuff.

281
00:19:41,608 --> 00:19:42,412
Rym: We do a lot of stuff.

282
00:19:42,734 --> 00:19:43,879
Scott: You got a lot of stuff going on.

283
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:45,586
Rym: So we watched an anime.

284
00:19:45,606 --> 00:19:46,691
Rym: Scott watched it all the way through.

285
00:19:46,711 --> 00:19:49,395
Rym: I watched a bunch of the beginning and I'm gonna watch the rest of it.

286
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:54,020
Rym: Devil man crybaby is making a big splash.

287
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:55,010
Scott: It already made the splash.

288
00:19:55,050 --> 00:20:01,200
Rym: the splash has done sploosh But in terms of like Anna Twitter and buzz it's one of those shows where it was all over the tweets.

289
00:20:01,342 --> 00:20:02,400
Scott: It was all over everything.

290
00:20:02,481 --> 00:20:07,108
Scott: It was a big big deal and then and now it's still a big deal But no one's talking about it where we've moved on.

291
00:20:07,229 --> 00:20:09,440
Rym: I still see people talking about it a lot in my Twitter.

292
00:20:09,521 --> 00:20:10,608
Scott: So here's a deal right?

293
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:12,399
Scott: There's a guy named gonna guy.

294
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:15,209
Rym: Don't know gonna guy is gonna guy made.

295
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:22,349
Scott: the biggest things he made at least were Mazinger Z Cutie honey and Debbie the man.

296
00:20:22,469 --> 00:20:25,037
Scott: now also other things but those are the big three of going a guy.

297
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,773
Rym: I saw Devil man, at least I like an old OAV.

298
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:30,019
Rym: I've seen devil man?

299
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:30,702
Scott: I don't.

300
00:20:31,203 --> 00:20:36,160
Scott: I have seen some amount of devil man and remember the only the vaguest of details.

301
00:20:36,281 --> 00:20:44,518
Rym: It was devil lady - okay But basically I don't really remember it that well because it was literally when I was a kid.

302
00:20:44,538 --> 00:20:47,900
Rym: I rented Everything in blockbuster in the anime section.

303
00:20:47,980 --> 00:21:02,580
Rym: So I saw a lot of shit like Armageddon and doom Megalopolis and devil man was just one of those things and all I remembered from it was it was the guy with the weird Batwing hair who fucking murdered the shit out of people, right?

304
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,120
Scott: Well, I knew it was a dude who was also a devil and he was fighting against actual devils.

305
00:21:08,301 --> 00:21:14,974
Scott: right and there was had freaky going a guy bad guys and was very Sexy and violent as going a guy.

306
00:21:15,034 --> 00:21:16,019
Scott: things are want to do.

307
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:17,410
Scott: Yeah, right and had the.

308
00:21:17,491 --> 00:21:18,480
Scott: it's sort of like this.

309
00:21:18,701 --> 00:21:31,636
Scott: It's you know, it's sort of like this space in between where you know Cutie honey is like, you know sexy adventuring fighting and Mazinger is not so sexy, but it is very violent and very like.

310
00:21:31,817 --> 00:21:35,451
Scott: well Mazinger Is he is you know, is he devil?

311
00:21:35,692 --> 00:21:37,520
Scott: or you know hero this giant?

312
00:21:38,722 --> 00:21:41,651
Scott: Robot right and devil man is right in between right?

313
00:21:41,972 --> 00:21:44,219
Scott: It's sort of like the combo of the two.

314
00:21:45,385 --> 00:21:56,213
Scott: so devil man crybaby is a New series that is not a continuous Not really a retelling or continuation of devil of the old devil man.

315
00:21:56,273 --> 00:22:00,645
Scott: What it is is a is a ten episodes TV OAV.

316
00:22:00,665 --> 00:22:11,700
Rym: so Oh envy and anime news network actually introduced us to a new term just now and They call it an ONA which is original Netflix anime.

317
00:22:12,102 --> 00:22:15,400
Rym: Okay, so as far as I can tell yeah original net anime.

318
00:22:15,482 --> 00:22:18,463
Rym: Yeah because the deal is You know OAVs.

319
00:22:18,524 --> 00:22:25,100
Scott: well, it's basically a 10 episode OAV that happens to be only distributed online and not on a physical medium.

320
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:41,579
Rym: So an OAV if you were an anime fan in the early to mid 90s or OVA if you're became an anime fan after that Was the term for anime that basically went direct-to-video as Opposed to being a like aired on network TV or getting a full theatrical release.

321
00:22:42,262 --> 00:22:50,972
Rym: So there was this era where there'd be a lot of like really high production value OAVs that were like short series of anime that were a distinct project.

322
00:22:51,433 --> 00:23:04,234
Rym: and there was another era of really fucking Garbo anime that were like a one episode adaptation of the first ball V's in the United States are like Aladdin to Disney sequels, right?

323
00:23:04,274 --> 00:23:06,000
Scott: They were direct-to-video movies.

324
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,427
Scott: You can get them by buying them.

325
00:23:07,808 --> 00:23:09,335
Scott: I like return to Jafar fight me.

326
00:23:09,777 --> 00:23:10,219
Rym: Uh, you know what?

327
00:23:11,341 --> 00:23:11,943
Rym: I'll go with that.

328
00:23:12,927 --> 00:23:14,212
Rym: I remember that I see.

329
00:23:14,272 --> 00:23:16,460
Rym: I saw that I see you anyway.

330
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:33,239
Rym: so Devilman crybaby is interesting because if you just go by like what people are Tweeting about it and you don't follow people who like really know about anime and are kind of real about anime You might get a and you don't know anything about going a guy.

331
00:23:33,741 --> 00:23:36,251
Rym: You might have a very different impression about what the show.

332
00:23:36,271 --> 00:23:38,480
Scott: the other thing is that not only did you know about going a guy?

333
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:42,000
Scott: The other important person here is Masa Masaaki Yuasa.

334
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:49,180
Scott: So Masaaki Yuasa, you might know him from doing he did an episode of adventure time and what was that first series?

335
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,519
Scott: he did that we that we watched a few episodes of.

336
00:23:52,680 --> 00:24:01,828
Scott: Basically it is you can always tell him a sake Yuasa anime because it's stylistically like Sort of off the wall and really unique.

337
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:04,736
Scott: It's almost like the Picasso of anime, right?

338
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:18,939
Scott: It doesn't look like Picasso You know, but it is sort of that unique and sorta, you know craziness but also Okay, it's hard to describe but I mean we're gonna see Lou over the wall on Fridays.

339
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:29,352
Scott: Yes Yeah on Friday at the start of the New York International Children's Film Festival They're showing Lou over the wall, which is also a Masaaki Yuasa joint.

340
00:24:29,994 --> 00:24:34,529
Scott: Yeah, whether there is other other director Screenplay executive producer for that one.

341
00:24:34,569 --> 00:24:35,634
Scott: Yeah, what else has he done though?

342
00:24:35,735 --> 00:24:36,700
Scott: I'm trying to remember.

343
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:43,111
Rym: I mean, he's one of those people who does a lot of like key animation credits all over the no Like when he since he started directing he's done stuff.

344
00:24:43,492 --> 00:24:44,055
Scott: What has he done?

345
00:24:44,075 --> 00:24:53,319
Scott: Ah Looking through all I did mind game right my yeah Yeah ping-pong the animation he did we got about that?

346
00:24:55,183 --> 00:24:57,974
Scott: I can't remember but basically he's the hot shit.

347
00:24:58,255 --> 00:24:59,419
Scott: Masaaki Yuasa right now.

348
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:04,040
Scott: Yeah, and this is like I guess is now like this is now the thing he's known for right?

349
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:11,513
Scott: It's like from now on when people talk about Masaaki Yuasa, they're gonna probably say Oh, yeah, the guy who did Devilman crybaby Masaaki Yuasa, right?

350
00:25:11,934 --> 00:25:21,540
Rym: So Devilman crybaby You Have to be prepared for a lot of sex violence and sexual violence.

351
00:25:21,901 --> 00:25:30,348
Rym: yes, you also have to be prepared for it to be really weird and really gory and May not immediately make sense.

352
00:25:30,911 --> 00:25:35,649
Rym: Mmm, if you are down with all of those things You should definitely watch Devilman crybaby.

353
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,673
Scott: See it's weird though, right?

354
00:25:36,713 --> 00:25:38,480
Scott: So there are definitely a lot of animes out there.

355
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,204
Scott: They don't make sense.

356
00:25:39,506 --> 00:25:44,414
Scott: Yeah, and there's a lot of anime that are gory and gross And they don't make sense from beginning to end right.

357
00:25:44,434 --> 00:25:45,300
Scott: you watch the whole thing.

358
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:45,541
Scott: You're like.

359
00:25:45,581 --> 00:25:46,625
Scott: that didn't make any sense.

360
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:48,915
Scott: That was a nonsensical just mixed up.

361
00:25:49,015 --> 00:25:49,638
Scott: No pacing.

362
00:25:49,658 --> 00:25:50,080
Scott: No plot.

363
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,926
Scott: It was just a bunch of random shit.

364
00:25:52,147 --> 00:25:54,795
Scott: Yeah, but don't man crybaby.

365
00:25:54,976 --> 00:26:01,642
Scott: It's hyperfast like things are happening constantly super fast with not a lot of St.

366
00:26:01,722 --> 00:26:17,120
Rym: Emily most shows will like base them like base their beats in terms of like the Physicality of action or like the reality of the situation like it'll pace itself at some Based on something in the real world or at least the real world of the show or the narrative.

367
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:22,400
Rym: But don't man crybaby just follows like the beats of the meta story.

368
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:30,130
Rym: It's trying to tell like it's gonna skip to whatever the next interesting part is Immediately and there's no there is no exposition.

369
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,176
Scott: They crammed a lot in the ten episodes.

370
00:26:32,196 --> 00:26:34,204
Scott: and even though it's going so fast Who's that?

371
00:26:34,264 --> 00:26:35,109
Rym: Oh, why is he got a gun?

372
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,780
Rym: Oh, I guess he's a devil now.

373
00:26:36,941 --> 00:26:47,080
Scott: and even though it's going so fast and show and showing you all not a lot as You like at first it's sort of like you just have all these questions cuz you're showing you seemingly random crap.

374
00:26:47,702 --> 00:26:53,099
Scott: And then like it's suddenly like comes together like as you get to like episode like later in the.

375
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:55,520
Scott: for now I'm not saying I'll watch it to the end then it comes together.

376
00:26:55,627 --> 00:27:01,740
Scott: No It's like towards the end of episode one two three the pace never slows down and never shows you any more exposition.

377
00:27:02,161 --> 00:27:11,640
Scott: But suddenly these things going crazy fast without stopping really make sense and come together like oh now I know who that character is finally after seeing them the third time.

378
00:27:11,861 --> 00:27:15,112
Scott: Oh now I see that those rapping guys are actually part of the story.

379
00:27:15,132 --> 00:27:17,200
Rym: It wasn't just oh my god those rapping guys, right?

380
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,024
Scott: It's like an episode one.

381
00:27:18,044 --> 00:27:23,239
Scott: these rapping guys show up do this awesome rap out of nowhere And like why are they even on this doc?

382
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:28,800
Rym: Well, I thought it was Good first and then they like pans down and you see right and it's like what the hell is happening.

383
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:39,580
Scott: And then like they're there again and they're there again and then they have names and then they're doing stuff and it's like, oh, okay Now that you know, they didn't have a scene where they're like, let's intro the rap guys.

384
00:27:39,721 --> 00:27:42,240
Scott: It's just sort of like they're there we tell you nothing.

385
00:27:42,581 --> 00:27:48,920
Scott: But then soon enough because you've seen them enough now you're used to what their deal is and you know You don't need an explanation, right?

386
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,805
Rym: And it's sort of like that all the thing.

387
00:27:51,086 --> 00:28:07,554
Rym: if something does not need to be explained because it's not relevant this show just ignores it and As a result the pacing is like take it take the maximum pace of ex-escaflowne Which is known for having a ridiculously fast pace and just like quadruple it.

388
00:28:07,574 --> 00:28:08,457
Rym: That's what the show is like.

389
00:28:08,477 --> 00:28:09,480
Rym: Yeah, so.

390
00:28:10,663 --> 00:28:19,320
Rym: But as opposed to say cuz you mentioned, you know Apocalypse zero is a super gross sexually violent fucked up show, but it goes nowhere and says nothing.

391
00:28:20,402 --> 00:28:25,840
Scott: So the show sort of has these two halves Sort of ish kind of like the main character.

392
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:26,720
Scott: But anyway.

393
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:41,652
Scott: so the first part is sort of like a more even though it's very sexy and very violent is a Little bit has a little bit of monster of the week action to it right where they'll be like, okay He's devil man and there's demons about.

394
00:28:42,034 --> 00:28:43,781
Scott: and but he since he's devil man He doesn't.

395
00:28:43,801 --> 00:28:47,620
Scott: he's actually against the demons and he's sort of hunting them down a bit, right?

396
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,860
Scott: So in each episode he sort of goes and finds some demons and fights them and shit goes down a little bit, right?

397
00:28:53,261 --> 00:28:56,109
Scott: And the the the overall plot sort of doesn't.

398
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,237
Scott: the big plot doesn't advance too much.

399
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:11,308
Scott: in those early episodes There is character development that occurs and things move forward but like the big plot doesn't open up right and then I don't know halfway ish through.

400
00:29:11,348 --> 00:29:13,736
Scott: I don't know exactly what episode because I watched them all together.

401
00:29:13,797 --> 00:29:14,459
Scott: So it's a big blur.

402
00:29:16,081 --> 00:29:21,677
Scott: Like the big plot opens up which is sort of like all these demons where the fuck they come from.

403
00:29:21,737 --> 00:29:22,640
Scott: Where is their plan?

404
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,747
Scott: Let's see what the terrible secret of space is.

405
00:29:24,787 --> 00:29:31,233
Rym: and then the very you got that opening sequence that looks like demons coming down On a planet and then it sort of just cuts into the show, right?

406
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:32,680
Scott: So Rym's only seen with three episodes.

407
00:29:32,801 --> 00:29:35,655
Scott: I saw the beginning and I'm gonna wash it all 11.

408
00:29:35,655 --> 00:29:41,057
Scott: I don't how many there are I think there's only ten anyway, and at the end is basically at the end is like Evangelion.

409
00:29:41,077 --> 00:29:41,920
Scott: basically, right?

410
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,807
Scott: It has an Ava like ending After you know, but it's sort of like.

411
00:29:47,149 --> 00:29:53,100
Scott: at least Ava also had that sort of Robot of the week into the big plot.

412
00:29:53,501 --> 00:30:03,980
Scott: But the difference is that Ava was much more normal in the beginning in like the first, you know Five six eight sort of tricks like a lot of people who say they don't understand it.

413
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,280
Rym: It starts out with a pretty straightforward like there's no straight robot.

414
00:30:07,521 --> 00:30:17,392
Rym: This skips over all the straightforward parts and goes straight to the not straightforward like it starts with the elevator scene in Ava and then just Immediately goes to like end of Evangelion.

415
00:30:17,694 --> 00:30:19,180
Rym: and that's where that's the first episode.

416
00:30:21,483 --> 00:30:31,700
Rym: I like Devilman because it it revokes for me the The weird violent shit that sort of introduced me to anime that I enjoyed.

417
00:30:32,302 --> 00:30:38,620
Rym: Sometimes sometimes I didn't enjoy but it feels crazy and weird and just very different from what I typically consume.

418
00:30:38,721 --> 00:30:57,333
Rym: So I like it for it's you know experimental Animation and you know, yeah And cool characters Flux would do where the camera angles are always like low and weird and then the framing is weird and characters are standing at weird angles.

419
00:30:57,573 --> 00:31:00,742
Scott: the craft of it the mute the sound and Such right?

420
00:31:00,762 --> 00:31:02,367
Scott: That's that's the best part of the show.

421
00:31:02,869 --> 00:31:10,759
Scott: the sex and violence is there if you just like to be shallowly Titillated which is you know, well not bad literally eaten by a tit.

422
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:17,619
Scott: Sure You know that stuff goes down to this demon fighting and all sorts of stuff like that, right?

423
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:29,328
Scott: But you know the I can't give it like saying it's like the best a anime because it sort of has this terrible Secret of space big thing going

424
00:31:29,348 --> 00:31:29,388
Rym: on

425
00:31:29,789 --> 00:31:43,760
Scott: but at no point does it like sort of capture my Desire to know what the deal is or like, you know mystify me with its epicness Right, and I think that's actually a consequence of its of its speediness, right?

426
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,344
Scott: It doesn't never.

427
00:31:44,505 --> 00:31:46,679
Scott: it doesn't have time to make me go.

428
00:31:47,121 --> 00:31:52,758
Scott: You know feel the same way about it as I feel about like, you know, ooh, what's under nerve headquarters?

429
00:31:52,858 --> 00:31:56,353
Rym: Yeah Evangelia the whole show you're like, what's that thing on the cross?

430
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:57,580
Rym: What's going on down there?

431
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:06,997
Scott: They don't give you any time just to feel like the mysteriousness of like, you know There's no scenes of you know, walking while the cicadas play for 30 seconds, right?

432
00:32:08,221 --> 00:32:21,092
Rym: Like if the first angel comes down in Ava and by the end of the episode there's like 50 Ava's now yeah, so I feel like if you want, you know, this is Probably one of the best animes this year so far.

433
00:32:21,313 --> 00:32:22,739
Scott: Yeah come out this year or last year.

434
00:32:23,221 --> 00:32:27,075
Scott: It's definitely one of the best recent animes, but I don't think it's for everyone.

435
00:32:27,095 --> 00:32:30,224
Scott: I don't For small children.

436
00:32:30,244 --> 00:32:37,448
Rym: I do not know if people who are legit fans of the original Devilman would like it or not What's really great.

437
00:32:37,508 --> 00:32:39,602
Scott: I don't know if you've seen these parts yet Where it actually.

438
00:32:39,622 --> 00:32:45,200
Scott: the original Devilman is an anime and manga that exists in the world.

439
00:32:45,341 --> 00:32:50,440
Rym: The kid keeps logging into his account and seeing the fucked up shit He's looking at but also watches that video, right?

440
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:59,455
Scott: There's like a kid and the kid is a fan of the old Devilman show and has like toys from the Gona guy old Devilman and like goes, you know, it's not like that.

441
00:32:59,495 --> 00:32:59,918
Scott: So it's like.

442
00:33:01,902 --> 00:33:02,163
Scott: It's like.

443
00:33:02,203 --> 00:33:07,040
Scott: imagine if there was a show called GeekNights and in that show this podcast existed.

444
00:33:07,963 --> 00:33:12,620
Scott: The characters were not me and but they were also making a podcast called.

445
00:33:15,003 --> 00:33:15,907
Rym: So, yeah, it's.

446
00:33:16,148 --> 00:33:18,760
Rym: there's a reason why everyone's talking about it.

447
00:33:19,222 --> 00:33:22,740
Rym: It's a show that is just very different from the sort of typical are.

448
00:33:23,641 --> 00:33:28,060
Scott: Animes like this are not made frequently also, which is why it stands out a lot, right?

449
00:33:28,241 --> 00:33:28,643
Scott: While

450
00:33:28,663 --> 00:33:44,740
Rym: it is evocative of that era of the like Ultraviolet OAV and American anime fandom because there was an era where that was a big part of like anime fandom here It is also much evolved from that format with a modern sensibility and modern artistry that those shows often lacked.

451
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:51,286
Scott: I mean even you know and even the parts of it that are literally just 90s violent anime.

452
00:33:51,767 --> 00:33:55,219
Scott: it's like well, there aren't really a lot of those these days so I could stand.

453
00:33:55,239 --> 00:34:05,454
Scott: you know You can see if you see some you know genre or era of a medium You know or whatever that nobody is making more of like.

454
00:34:05,514 --> 00:34:17,560
Scott: people are still making disco music But if they weren't you could make a disco song and probably do well, so that's what this is Nobody's making 90s style violent animes so you could do well to make one and so they did.

455
00:34:17,801 --> 00:34:22,760
Rym: I mean the closest thing that came to that that evoking those feelings was actually the Castlevania ONA.

456
00:34:23,443 --> 00:34:27,440
Scott: But it was also a Netflix joint, but this is way better than the Castlevania.

457
00:34:29,623 --> 00:34:32,429
Scott: It was okay, this is like ten times better than that.

458
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:41,536
Rym: well because this it's one of those things where the creative forces behind it Appear to be given full free rein to go as crazy as they like.

459
00:34:41,556 --> 00:34:41,917
Scott: well they get.

460
00:34:41,938 --> 00:34:43,746
Scott: I guess Netflix Just throws money at ship.

461
00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:51,757
Scott: I don't know what reason and then they just Masaaki you I was just did what the fuck you wanted, but I guess there's a reason why everyone's talking about it.

462
00:34:51,779 --> 00:35:01,160
Rym: if You are okay with hypergory violence and That kind of thing this is probably worth watching.

463
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:05,454
Rym: This is not the show to show someone to say hey check out this check out.

464
00:35:05,494 --> 00:35:07,079
Rym: What anime is it is well?

465
00:35:09,182 --> 00:35:14,257
Scott: There are a lot of people who are like check out what anime is and that totally worked on them it did.

466
00:35:14,598 --> 00:35:18,860
Scott: if it's that Kind of person here's the thing to show them rather than showing them like ninja.

467
00:35:19,301 --> 00:35:27,819
Rym: If you have a fan of someone you know who you think you could get them into anime with that weird old violent 90s Crap, but that person is the kind of person who won't watch something old.

468
00:35:28,821 --> 00:35:32,134
Rym: This is your way in sure, but yeah, I'm gonna watch the rest of it.

469
00:35:32,235 --> 00:35:40,702
Rym: I'm I'm curious And unlike apocalypse zero I do enjoy this To this day.

470
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,528
Rym: I don't think I enjoyed apocalypse zero.

471
00:35:42,709 --> 00:35:45,698
Scott: fuck up zero has the same craziness, but no you don't enjoy why?

472
00:35:45,718 --> 00:35:55,139
Rym: no You watch it so you know and then you know and you remember that you saw it And that's really the only reason to see it is so you know.

473
00:35:55,922 --> 00:36:00,960
Rym: This is actually pretty good as long as you're okay with the things we talked about because they are all there.

474
00:36:01,342 --> 00:36:06,950
Rym: And if you watch the first half of the first episode and think this isn't as bad as I expected You pretty much got to stop it.

475
00:36:07,171 --> 00:36:07,392
Rym: right.

476
00:36:07,472 --> 00:36:10,889
Rym: then because it's gonna It escalates apart.

477
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:19,780
Scott: you mean they get the party they get to the nightclub And that's when shit goes down the party starts a little bit Devilish and you think really all right?

478
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,325
Rym: This is what everyone's freaking out about.

479
00:36:21,787 --> 00:36:24,719
