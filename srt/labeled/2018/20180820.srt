00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,727
Rym: It's Monday August 20th 2018.

2
00:00:11,727 --> 00:00:14,474
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:14,795 --> 00:00:17,020
Rym: Twitter API's and third-party clients.

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,937
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:26,815
Rym: We hit up that old flame con this weekend, which I didn't get to go to last year.

6
00:00:26,836 --> 00:00:27,478
Rym: I forget why.

7
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:28,060
Scott: why didn't you go?

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,202
Scott: I was there last.

9
00:00:29,303 --> 00:00:29,564
Scott: I know.

10
00:00:29,624 --> 00:00:31,311
Rym: I don't remember why I didn't go.

11
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,580
Rym: I just remember I had some reason why I didn't go.

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,611
Scott: I know it was in Brooklyn last year is in a worser place.

13
00:00:36,872 --> 00:00:38,820
Rym: Yeah, it's definitely in a better place this year.

14
00:00:40,043 --> 00:00:44,891
Scott: Well, I was in a more touristy place which is bad But the building was better and easier to get to because it was in a touristy place.

15
00:00:45,272 --> 00:00:47,461
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, you know It's.

16
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:55,408
Scott: it's a room full of awesome Gay gay gay comics for you can go there and you could walk around for a couple hours buy a bunch of gayness and then Go home.

17
00:00:55,614 --> 00:00:56,503
Rym: Yep It's kind of a like.

18
00:00:56,523 --> 00:01:07,360
Rym: it was basically an artist alley like a really inclusive one with a really good set and it kind of Straddles the line between like old mocha fast and t-caf and an anime con artist alley like all mixed together.

19
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:08,583
Rym: It was good stuff.

20
00:01:08,964 --> 00:01:09,145
Rym: Mm-hmm.

21
00:01:09,385 --> 00:01:11,932
Rym: I got a pretty good pin and so did Emily.

22
00:01:12,253 --> 00:01:14,660
Scott: I got a nice pin from our friends.

23
00:01:18,124 --> 00:01:18,708
Scott: Very nice.

24
00:01:19,332 --> 00:01:24,129
Rym: I also got the The smutty comic that you go in and off had.

25
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:27,158
Rym: that was about Reaper and soldier 76 in overwatch.

26
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:28,766
Rym: Okay It's pretty good.

27
00:01:29,068 --> 00:01:30,618
Rym: Okay, it's actually pretty good.

28
00:01:31,663 --> 00:01:32,325
Scott: I don't know who they are.

29
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:34,253
Scott: So it doesn't mean doesn't mean much.

30
00:01:34,735 --> 00:01:35,397
Rym: Yeah, it's just.

31
00:01:35,457 --> 00:01:36,120
Rym: it's very interesting.

32
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:44,840
Rym: Overwatch has half of its fandom is people who play the game and half of its fandom is people who will never play the game But are equally invested in it for some reason, right?

33
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,886
Scott: But it's like, you know your ship.

34
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,979
Scott: don't work on me if I don't know who the characters are.

35
00:01:48,921 --> 00:01:50,247
Rym: It's basically the edge Lord.

36
00:01:50,307 --> 00:01:53,440
Rym: like I am the Reaper guy and this like old soldier dad guy.

37
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,215
Rym: You may or may not have dated before they turned into what they are today.

38
00:01:57,235 --> 00:01:57,617
Rym: Okay?

39
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:07,717
Rym: Seems like a lot of people our age are really invested in the soldier guy because his shik is basically He's the old man who used to play FPS is and now he's too old, but he still plays.

40
00:02:07,737 --> 00:02:08,419
Rym: Mm-hmm.

41
00:02:08,702 --> 00:02:12,496
Rym: Like he's basically our friend Adam transported directly into the game.

42
00:02:13,121 --> 00:02:16,774
Rym: Mm-hmm, and his voice lines are things that Adam says on his own in game.

43
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:17,396
Rym: So it's pretty good.

44
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:17,918
Rym: Mm-hmm.

45
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:26,663
Rym: so anyway, there's a ton of news and some of it's actually relevant to technology and also Kind of worrying.

46
00:02:26,683 --> 00:02:30,273
Rym: I guess we'll dive right in with this twitch prime nonsense.

47
00:02:30,494 --> 00:02:31,938
Scott: Okay, so here's the deal right now.

48
00:02:32,078 --> 00:02:38,468
Scott: if you are Amazon Prime person subscriber Yep You also for free.

49
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:44,920
Scott: as part of your many many things that you get with Amazon Prime You get a bunch of twitch shit because Amazon owns twitch.

50
00:02:45,602 --> 00:02:51,159
Scott: So the things you got for having twitch for having an Amazon Prime account and also using twitch at all.

51
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:57,060
Scott: A you would get some discounts when you pre-ordered certain video games.

52
00:02:57,381 --> 00:03:01,739
Scott: Yeah, you would get a bunch of free video games that you in order to install you have to install the twitch app.

53
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,050
Scott: But you get free video games.

54
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,560
Scott: you get free loot in a lot of games.

55
00:03:05,882 --> 00:03:12,320
Rym: I actually haven't collected any of the free pub G loot, dude I'm up to three hundred and twenty loot boxes and overwatch alone that I haven't opened.

56
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:15,379
Scott: I just I'm just gonna stay with the normal default shit, whatever.

57
00:03:16,142 --> 00:03:20,114
Rym: No in pub G. I did put on the belt because apparently it has a game effect.

58
00:03:20,154 --> 00:03:20,856
Scott: Yeah, finally.

59
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:24,245
Scott: Yeah You get.

60
00:03:24,265 --> 00:03:31,835
Scott: the one of the major features is that you Every month you can subscribe to one channel on twitch for free.

61
00:03:31,955 --> 00:03:33,540
Scott: nor so normally that cost like $5.

62
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,684
Scott: So now you go.

63
00:03:34,704 --> 00:03:40,300
Scott: you pick one twitch streamer every month that has a sponsorship that you can subscribe to push the subscribe button.

64
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:47,842
Scott: It costs you nothing and then that streamer actually gets money from Amazon as if you had subscribed with $5.

65
00:03:47,842 --> 00:03:50,430
Scott: So actually twitch streamers really love this.

66
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:56,080
Scott: they constantly like harass their channels to subscribe for free And they make a lot of money on that.

67
00:03:56,944 --> 00:04:07,400
Scott: So even if you don't watch twitch a lot if you have Amazon Prime You should go on twitch find someone you like and just once a month All you got to do is click one button and you'll be giving that person money.

68
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,929
Scott: Find a person who deserves money and do that someone not.

69
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:11,073
Scott: Rym now full disclosure.

70
00:04:11,173 --> 00:04:13,020
Rym: I honestly I never streamed a twitch.

71
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:15,738
Rym: I actually don't watch twitch anymore pretty much ever.

72
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:19,480
Scott: I watch it when you know, there's a GDQ and I watch a hearthstone.

73
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,276
Rym: Usually I just time shift and I watch that content later on YouTube.

74
00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:28,331
Rym: It's not all the contents on you Yeah, and the stuff that isn't on YouTube.

75
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,216
Rym: I kind of just don't watch it.

76
00:04:29,277 --> 00:04:31,607
Scott: It was a ground I've been watching on the GDQ channel.

77
00:04:31,627 --> 00:04:32,892
Scott: They have these mystery tournaments.

78
00:04:32,952 --> 00:04:33,735
Scott: They started up again.

79
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:34,839
Scott: They're really anyway.

80
00:04:36,772 --> 00:04:42,300
Scott: So, yeah The most important thing that you get if you have Amazon Prime and also happen to watch twitch is that you see no ads?

81
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,926
Scott: Yeah, you see no ads anywhere ever.

82
00:04:43,946 --> 00:04:46,457
Rym: I'm not willing to see an ad for anything.

83
00:04:46,778 --> 00:04:51,137
Scott: So Amazon Prime sent an email to everyone today saying alright, we're changing twitch prime.

84
00:04:51,177 --> 00:04:52,021
Scott: Here's how it works Now.

85
00:04:52,081 --> 00:04:55,130
Scott: number one the game pre-order thing is changing to where.

86
00:04:55,190 --> 00:05:04,240
Scott: now instead of getting this discount on pre-ordering a bunch of games Certain games that if you pre-order you'll get a $10 credit, but the credit comes later.

87
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:13,620
Scott: So it's like you buy the game at full price and then later they send you $10 in credit that you can use to buy Something for a limited and you better use it because it'll expire after some months or whatever.

88
00:05:14,121 --> 00:05:16,949
Scott: So it's basically slightly less good discounted pre-ordering games.

89
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,499
Scott: And the other thing they're changing is they're getting rid of the no ads.

90
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:37,517
Scott: so Basically, if you watch twitch and you have Amazon Prime you're gonna see ads But you're not gonna see them until I think your current Amazon Prime subscription runs out with switch from activated Blah-blah-blah will still get to enjoy ad free viewing until October 15th, right?

91
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:48,980
Rym: Then then basically that's when you like you renew your Amazon Prime and then they right after that The only way to get ad free viewing will be to subscribe to twitch turbo for which is separate and cost nine bucks a month.

92
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,763
Scott: Yeah, it's like fuck.

93
00:05:49,803 --> 00:05:52,193
Scott: No, that's too much for just that one thing.

94
00:05:52,274 --> 00:05:53,700
Scott: I mean that I used to get for free.

95
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,405
Rym: That's like what I pay for crunchyroll.

96
00:05:55,806 --> 00:05:59,036
Rym: There's a lot better content on crunchyroll than twitch.

97
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,683
Scott: Well, it's not just the content It's like it's.

98
00:06:00,823 --> 00:06:03,860
Scott: I'm just paying to remove ads and not even paying for the content, right?

99
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:08,512
Scott: And then you can still get your one free subscription a month.

100
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:12,553
Scott: and most channels on Twitch Do have a setting enabled.

101
00:06:12,593 --> 00:06:15,207
Scott: they can turn it off But most of them enable it to where.

102
00:06:15,327 --> 00:06:18,620
Scott: if you are a subscriber to the channel, you won't see ads on that channel.

103
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:25,779
Scott: So for example during the GDQ months, you could use your free subscription to the GDQ channel And you won't see ads on that channel.

104
00:06:26,343 --> 00:06:36,020
Scott: But if you are someone who watches many channels on Twitch Then this ain't gonna help you that much because you're subscribing for free to one channel and you're gonna see ads on every other channel.

105
00:06:36,544 --> 00:06:37,027
Rym: So what does it do?

106
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:38,960
Rym: because I don't use twitch that much anymore.

107
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,660
Rym: But how about if I'm hosting someone else's channel and someone subscribed to me?

108
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:46,420
Scott: That's a good question.

109
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:50,700
Scott: That works because until today I saw no ads on twitch.

110
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,213
Scott: So the result of this is gonna be the following number one.

111
00:06:53,394 --> 00:06:54,420
Rym: I'm gonna watch a lot less twitch.

112
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,560
Rym: I'm gonna watch a lot less - well, I guess I can't watch less because I watch effectively zero already.

113
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,945
Scott: Well, I'm not going to.

114
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:03,799
Scott: I'm basically gonna be very careful of who I give my free subscription to.

115
00:07:03,859 --> 00:07:11,360
Scott: now Think about which channel I'm gonna watch the most - if adblock doesn't work on Twitch, I'm gonna watch a lot less twitch.

116
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:14,313
Scott: Yeah, and be see whatever.

117
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:20,740
Scott: Well, I don't even know If I can't use adblock on twitch and say the twitch app on my iPad.

118
00:07:21,243 --> 00:07:23,738
Scott: I can only use adblock obviously in a browser assuming it works.

119
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:27,499
Scott: Yeah I'm just not gonna be watching twitch on my iPad or my iPhone or you know.

120
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,340
Scott: It's interesting because unless it's that one channel.

121
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:36,119
Rym: It is interesting though because the in a browser like that aspect of this is very much relevant to our main bit today.

122
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:45,940
Scott: Yeah so the The one last thing is that twitch subscriptions to one channel one channel just one channel they cost $5 a month minimum.

123
00:07:46,321 --> 00:07:53,460
Scott: Yeah, usually right and it's like bro, if they were $1, I would subscribe to like 10 channels a month.

124
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,224
Rym: right.

125
00:07:55,682 --> 00:08:00,159
Scott: But because they're $5 you just subscribe to - I just subscribe to the one free one.

126
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:07,518
Scott: One time I accidentally used my one free one on the not GDQ channel in the GDQ month that and I paid the $5 one time.

127
00:08:09,084 --> 00:08:09,999
Scott: But yeah, I'm not.

128
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:13,811
Scott: I'd have to watch your channel a lot to pay $5.

129
00:08:13,811 --> 00:08:14,253
Rym: I guess it.

130
00:08:14,634 --> 00:08:16,180
Rym: it worries me a little for a month.

131
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:18,160
Scott: It's like compared to what else you get.

132
00:08:18,221 --> 00:08:18,859
Scott: It's like, you know.

133
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,365
Scott: But if you know the other thing is like.

134
00:08:20,426 --> 00:08:20,727
Scott: I know.

135
00:08:20,847 --> 00:08:27,780
Scott: people for example might subscribe to someone on patreon And that person they subscribe to on patreon happens to have a twitch channel.

136
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,097
Scott: So they're giving that person monthly money, but because they don't subscribe to them on twitch.

137
00:08:32,116 --> 00:08:33,895
Scott: They have my patreon They're gonna see ads now.

138
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:41,000
Rym: Well, because I definitely all these platforms like twitch they definitely want to get an end run around services like patreon.

139
00:08:41,183 --> 00:08:48,681
Scott: well because You're on your patreon is taking the cut if you do twitch Amazon's taking a cut and I think it's a bigger cut of the $5.

140
00:08:48,681 --> 00:08:51,216
Scott: Yeah patreon takes of the $1 but it more there's.

141
00:08:51,417 --> 00:09:03,050
Rym: the worry I really have is that this might be a harbinger of Another round of everyone realizing that the monetization streams of these services are not that robust And they're looking for more money.

142
00:09:03,191 --> 00:09:20,539
Rym: and what we've always done on gig nights For many many years is that whenever you have a service that people pay for and people are paying for it primarily to not see ads Then the people who sell ads or want to buy ads Desperately want those eyeballs because those are the people they know have money.

143
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:24,660
Rym: So as a result, there's always this pressure paying for ads on twitch.

144
00:09:24,921 --> 00:09:27,453
Scott: It's like a bunch of kids with no money are seeing your ads.

145
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:28,397
Scott: those ads are.

146
00:09:28,457 --> 00:09:29,461
Scott: it's like, you know Do you go?

147
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:35,160
Scott: and it's like ad for fancy gamer chairs while the kids all the kids watching that either have fancy gamer chairs.

148
00:09:35,482 --> 00:09:40,600
Scott: Maybe bother their parents for a fancy gamer chair Don't have money for to buy one.

149
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:49,500
Scott: Yeah, and meanwhile the people like me who have enough money to buy a gamer chair I would never buy one but other people like me who have money would because I see them sitting in them all the fucking time.

150
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,006
Rym: It doesn't matter if they would or not though.

151
00:09:51,026 --> 00:09:53,575
Scott: They have twitch private aren't seeing this ad.

152
00:09:53,716 --> 00:09:59,880
Rym: Yep, but the advertisers They want the eyeballs desperately of the people who have money and don't see ads.

153
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:06,320
Rym: They're so desperate for that money And my worry is that this is gonna be a problem because another news that snuck in just recently.

154
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:24,363
Scott: Yeah, also the other thing is that if you are twitch streamer or a twitch Itself, right and the money is coming from the advertisers and not from the viewers Then you're going to be changing your content to suit the advertiser and as opposed to changing your content to suit the viewer Right.

155
00:10:24,403 --> 00:10:33,420
Scott: It's like imagine you're a twitch streamer right now wants lots of subs Right and they you know, they want people with Amazon Prime to watch their channel given the free.

156
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,780
Rym: So I guess that will change, you know, it'll change is they're good?

157
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:39,780
Rym: They're all gonna want people who want to subscribe if they want shave club or whatever, right?

158
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,359
Scott: But I guess if they want better ads to show up on their channel, then I don't know.

159
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:50,360
Rym: Well, I was playing around as an aside on the Twitter regular app because it'll like it'll show ads relevant to the main bit.

160
00:10:50,843 --> 00:10:55,626
Rym: so what I did is I started blocking every account that showed an ad and Within about a week.

161
00:10:56,369 --> 00:11:00,605
Rym: I started seeing the weirdest fucking ads Like it can't.

162
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:03,660
Rym: the accounts that are trying to sell me ads can't show up in my feed.

163
00:11:04,102 --> 00:11:06,191
Rym: So I'm seeing really weird ads like.

164
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:13,020
Rym: I saw an ad that was literally like Some kid trying to get people to subscribe to his personal YouTube channel that has like 40 subscribers.

165
00:11:15,227 --> 00:11:17,985
Rym: I blocked him of course But that's what I was seeing.

166
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:31,780
Rym: but my worry is that the Netflix news and you've probably seen this but Netflix is starting to try out They're sneaking back in Showing ads for other shows on Netflix between episodes of shows you're watching, right?

167
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,562
Scott: So at least it's not.

168
00:11:32,643 --> 00:11:35,914
Scott: at least it's not ads for ads, but it's still not good.

169
00:11:36,015 --> 00:11:37,500
Rym: Yeah, it's a chink in the armor.

170
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,427
Rym: It's a hole in the wall.

171
00:11:38,507 --> 00:11:48,639
Rym: as soon as they sneak that in It's a worrying precedent because the only reason I ever subscribed to Netflix was that I want to see things And I don't want to see ads.

172
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:55,180
Rym: So if I mean I'm already considering canceling Netflix actually don't watch it that much anymore.

173
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:58,330
Scott: But yeah, I turned off Hulu and I got Netflix.

174
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,965
Scott: but actually, you know, I watched most of the things on Netflix I want to watch.

175
00:12:02,006 --> 00:12:03,340
Scott: I don't watch it too often.

176
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:08,000
Rym: I believe it was a lot of the things I was watching or wanted to watch are no longer on Netflix.

177
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,400
Rym: Well, you know what I'm actually what Netflix is actually really starting to not have enough content that I actually care about.

178
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,211
Scott: Well, the other thing is a lot of the stuff I want.

179
00:12:16,251 --> 00:12:17,800
Scott: I was thinking I'll watch that on Netflix.

180
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,763
Scott: I haven't actually watched.

181
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:22,597
Scott: Yeah, like I was like, oh, I'll watch that stranger things thing.

182
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:23,159
Scott: I haven't watched it.

183
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:24,827
Rym: It's actually real real good.

184
00:12:24,887 --> 00:12:27,600
Scott: I'm sure if I really like it, but it's like I haven't watched it.

185
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,463
Scott: So why am I paying?

186
00:12:28,724 --> 00:12:32,520
Scott: I'm paying dollars this month and not to not watch it, but entire shows.

187
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,372
Scott: I'll wait until the moment where I say I'm going to watch it now and then pay.

188
00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:40,700
Rym: there are entire shows that I was watching Kind of idly on Netflix that are no longer licensed to not on Netflix.

189
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:41,720
Rym: So I had to pirate the rest.

190
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:57,730
Scott: I mean I was paying for this these Korean shows on this Korean streaming site on demand Korea and they keep putting all the shows Up there, but the shows that I was watching Specifically those shows happened to be honest one Korean cable network called JTBC Yeah, and they lost the license to subtitle those shows.

191
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,180
Scott: so they keep putting up new episodes of these shows without subtitles.

192
00:13:00,762 --> 00:13:02,288
Scott: So and I cancel that.

193
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:05,160
Rym: but I guess be ready and be wary.

194
00:13:05,341 --> 00:13:19,196
Rym: I really think that advertising is going to creep into a number of streaming platforms Coupled with the fact that streaming is starting to split out into a million different channels again Which I think is just gonna drive people back to piracy.

195
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:24,180
Scott: the thing that well Yes for me anything that I can't get legal streaming is no ads is pirated.

196
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:41,920
Scott: But one thing one channel I actually have been using is it's actually I'm surprised that the I was When he started showing up, I thought they wouldn't be successful But they actually seem to be more successful than I thought at first is that there's these Like niche streaming things that like only do one category of content.

197
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:47,960
Scott: Yeah, so there's one that I think I don't subscribe to it, but it's called shutter and it's like just hard.

198
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:55,028
Scott: So I know that like this I have heard of like some people who are way into hard Stuff and it's like you can subscribe to that and that's like.

199
00:13:55,048 --> 00:13:55,570
Scott: that's all it is.

200
00:13:56,581 --> 00:14:01,222
Scott: but actually one thing I do subscribe to that costs like 100 you pay for it yearly, which I like.

201
00:14:01,282 --> 00:14:16,390
Scott: it's like $100 a year is Filmstruck and it's basically all old highbrow movies unlimited watching like every criterion collection movie all these AMC You know, oh, yeah, like Turner classic like every old movie ever is on there.

202
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,042
Rym: Well, cuz that's all the stuff that in the old days I would get from Netflix via DVD.

203
00:14:20,102 --> 00:14:21,330
Rym: but a lot of that isn't even on right.

204
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:21,751
Scott: It's all.

205
00:14:21,851 --> 00:14:22,072
Scott: it's like.

206
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:25,000
Scott: it's not everything ever but it's like it's a lot right.

207
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:29,720
Scott: It's so if you want to watch highbrow old movie It's pretty good.

208
00:14:30,044 --> 00:14:43,850
Rym: now It definitely doesn't have ads cuz Netflix did say that they at least for now They've ruled out taking ads from external companies calling it a quote core differentiator Mm-hmm, but they will spend money to promote their own shows.

209
00:14:44,432 --> 00:14:48,447
Rym: And if you didn't realize this they do also take product placement for their originals.

210
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:49,953
Scott: Yes Like.

211
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:58,470
Rym: actually there's an example here when the kids eat KFC in stranger things That's because someone paid probably half a million dollars for KFC to be in the episode.

212
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,004
Scott: What's really one thing from watching a lot of Korean TV?

213
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,716
Scott: It's actually great Like it was first of all.

214
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:07,190
Scott: when you watch Korean TV in America subtitled the ads are mostly gone, right?

215
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,990
Scott: Yeah, but you can tell how few commercial breaks they have.

216
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:14,402
Scott: I think the commercial breaks are long actually, but they're infrequent.

217
00:15:14,422 --> 00:15:16,169
Scott: the big once or twice a show at most.

218
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:22,230
Rym: Oh my god watching any old American show like even The Simpsons like I've been watching that again recently like random old episodes.

219
00:15:22,693 --> 00:15:24,785
Rym: You can just see where all the commercial breaks.

220
00:15:25,026 --> 00:15:25,127
Scott: Yeah.

221
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:25,348
Scott: Yeah.

222
00:15:25,368 --> 00:15:30,870
Scott: Yep So many in Korean shows the big maybe one or two even for like an hour super long show.

223
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,056
Scott: They'd be like hardly any breaks.

224
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:33,262
Scott: I feel like they're long breaks.

225
00:15:33,302 --> 00:15:34,689
Scott: I don't know exactly how long they are.

226
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:38,350
Scott: Well, the other thing is that users tons of product placement.

227
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:42,427
Scott: But you can see how restricted the product placement is like.

228
00:15:42,447 --> 00:15:48,443
Scott: if someone's wearing a shirt This is like McDonald's on it They'll have to you little put like black tape over it because you get in trouble.

229
00:15:48,663 --> 00:15:51,714
Scott: McDonald's got to pay or they'll blur it out Or right.

230
00:15:51,754 --> 00:15:52,437
Scott: It's like they'll have.

231
00:15:52,538 --> 00:15:53,140
Scott: but it's not just.

232
00:15:53,501 --> 00:15:54,345
Scott: it's like they'll be.

233
00:15:54,405 --> 00:16:02,801
Scott: even when this product placement That obviously was paid for like everyone is wearing the same shirt a sponsor paid for them to wear the shirt It's all blurred out like you can.

234
00:16:02,922 --> 00:16:09,750
Scott: the severe limitations By the Korean government which people in America will say is censorship or whatever.

235
00:16:09,911 --> 00:16:13,226
Scott: But I guess it is censorship because the government is mandating it.

236
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:21,110
Scott: Yeah, but It's I don't see it as censorship because it's a restriction on commercial speech and not individual speech, right?

237
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:25,570
Scott: It's the same thing as like restricting people from printing certain things on their products, right?

238
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,597
Scott: So that are lies, you know, like is.

239
00:16:27,637 --> 00:16:31,070
Rym: I wonder how that applies to low-tier commercial speech in Korea.

240
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,081
Rym: Like what if some kids twitch streaming and they drink a dr.

241
00:16:34,121 --> 00:16:34,984
Rym: Pepper like can they get?

242
00:16:35,045 --> 00:16:38,556
Scott: I don't know how it applies to stream To find out.

243
00:16:38,737 --> 00:16:39,740
Rym: Yeah, I actually am cuz.

244
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:45,065
Rym: I feel like I feel like there's a lot of negative to that But I don't know enough about it to say for sure.

245
00:16:45,106 --> 00:16:50,470
Scott: in Korean TV They're always that it's like you can tell what the product is, right because the sponsors wouldn't go.

246
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:51,988
Scott: You can always tell what it is.

247
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:59,235
Scott: Like you'll be watching a show where people are in a kitchen and like there's this really obvious machine and then they'll be like A five-minute scene where they go.

248
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,124
Scott: Oh, they all go over and use the carbonation machine.

249
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:03,810
Scott: Oh, what are you doing there?

250
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,215
Scott: It's like it's so obvious.

251
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,321
Scott: or they'll be a scene.

252
00:17:06,342 --> 00:17:07,749
Scott: in a show like a show.

253
00:17:08,131 --> 00:17:14,390
Scott: We're like all the idols suddenly all drink the same beverage And they're all talking about it and it's blurred out.

254
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,661
Scott: You can't see what it is, but you can tell what it is.

255
00:17:16,762 --> 00:17:26,068
Rym: It's good when you go to the grocery store That one but I just suspect there's going to be a big pressure to push ads into spaces where they previously didn't exist.

256
00:17:26,469 --> 00:17:28,297
Rym: again I think there's a wave of that coming.

257
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:28,579
Rym: Mm-hmm.

258
00:17:29,222 --> 00:17:33,650
Rym: So in some other news that adds ever Yeah, I will I will I will do almost anything.

259
00:17:34,111 --> 00:17:39,710
Scott: I mean, you know, this is also because they're gonna tell you the streamers are gonna make more money this way, right?

260
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,775
Rym: No, I'll just pay the streamers directly.

261
00:17:41,816 --> 00:17:49,001
Scott: I sympathize with the streamer wanting to make more money, but I am unwilling to Subject myself to corporate brainwashing for that purpose.

262
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:49,222
Rym: Yep.

263
00:17:49,262 --> 00:17:51,210
Rym: My time is more valuable than any dollar.

264
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:59,385
Rym: So in some news, that's interesting NVIDIA announced some crazy new GPUs when we knew these were coming.

265
00:17:59,405 --> 00:18:01,313
Scott: I thought they would have come a few months ago But they're here.

266
00:18:02,018 --> 00:18:02,581
Scott: They announced them.

267
00:18:02,622 --> 00:18:18,021
Scott: now that at SIGGRAPH They announced the like the the the super quadro ones for you know, people who make movies and stuff Yeah, but now they announced the ones for gamers the RTX 2070 2080 TI good lord.

268
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:19,950
Rym: Are they a lot of money and very powerful?

269
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,471
Scott: Well, they're not actually that much more money than 1080.

270
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:37,070
Scott: Yeah And you know Assuming that coins die fully which they're close to it The prices in reality will be a hundred or two hundred dollars lower than the real real retail prices, right eventually You know some months or year out or whatever the main deal about these cards.

271
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:43,435
Rym: The reason why people are making such a big deal isn't so much that oh, they're just better geforce cards They are but 1080 is still gonna be just.

272
00:18:43,876 --> 00:18:45,441
Scott: hopefully the 1080 price goes down.

273
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:56,210
Rym: because yeah, because frankly the 1080 I can stream Multiple streams at different bit rates while playing overwatch in epic epic settings at full framerate.

274
00:18:56,572 --> 00:18:59,269
Rym: Totally fine with GPU to spare.

275
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:02,237
Scott: But 4k monitor though.

276
00:19:02,297 --> 00:19:03,200
Rym: No, I do not.

277
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:09,892
Rym: I feel like if I had a 4k monitor and I was playing in 4k I might have to lock my 4k.

278
00:19:09,912 --> 00:19:10,615
Rym: yeah, I don't know.

279
00:19:10,635 --> 00:19:11,197
Rym: I haven't tried it.

280
00:19:11,438 --> 00:19:12,722
Rym: Yeah, I could I could.

281
00:19:12,782 --> 00:19:14,127
Rym: I could try streaming in 4k, right?

282
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,733
Rym: There's my limiter there.

283
00:19:17,435 --> 00:19:19,120
Scott: I mean YouTube I think supports it.

284
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,108
Scott: I don't think twitch does no twitch which is anyway anyway.

285
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:27,082
Rym: But these cards offer real-time ray tracing.

286
00:19:27,122 --> 00:19:51,190
Scott: So as someone who has written a ray tracer in C Ray tracing basically what you do is you have a camera you have your scene of objects and then you calculate Literally rays of light coming out of the light sources what color they are their intensity all that stuff Bouncing off of the objects in the in the scene and then hitting the camera right which is the screen, right?

287
00:19:51,310 --> 00:20:02,545
Scott: So you're basically calculating the color of each pixel one at a time based on actual, you know photons Right bouncing off objects that are different colors to figure out what color they'll be when right.

288
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:03,850
Scott: and that's how you render a scene.

289
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:17,655
Scott: And when you render a scene in that way using that kind of math It looks stunning and if you do a really good job of it and use all sorts of modern techniques it you can look even Completely realistic like you wouldn't even know that it's not the real world, you know It really depends.

290
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,670
Scott: you got a model the scene to be realistic, right?

291
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:24,090
Scott: And then you also have to you know get the camera and lights to be you know set up, right?

292
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,490
Scott: But yeah, it's ray tracing is amazing.

293
00:20:26,571 --> 00:20:33,855
Scott: And there's a reason you don't see ray tracing used In video games is because takes a fucking long ass time like the ray tracer I wrote when it would.

294
00:20:34,056 --> 00:20:34,759
Scott: we knew to run it.

295
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:37,069
Scott: It would render one frame.

296
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:42,450
Scott: What was one of those machines they had in the computer science lab like spark?

297
00:20:42,872 --> 00:20:46,066
Scott: Oh, yeah spark workstations hilarious spark ultra is it?

298
00:20:46,086 --> 00:20:50,510
Scott: whatever god That was a long time ago and you would see it drawing from the top left of the screen.

299
00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:59,969
Scott: It would draw a line of pixels across to the right Next line and draw row of pixels across to the right and it would look like somebody drawing very, you know It take up a few minutes to draw the one frame.

300
00:21:00,494 --> 00:21:07,915
Scott: So in order to have it work in a video game You would have to be able to do that thing that my program did in minutes in 60 times a second.

301
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,370
Scott: now, obviously my program would run much faster today on a modern computer.

302
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:15,610
Rym: That wasn't a spark ultra but not fast enough to find a frame buffer in real time.

303
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:21,723
Scott: It would not render that scene 60 times a second, which this Video card can now do.

304
00:21:21,743 --> 00:21:26,515
Scott: so according this article I'm sure it's not perfect and amazing But it's gonna be.

305
00:21:26,956 --> 00:21:28,521
Scott: it's still amazing compared to what I got.

306
00:21:28,722 --> 00:21:32,734
Rym: Nvidia is promising real-time ray tracing in Shadow of the Tomb Raider.

307
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:35,061
Scott: a real game a real game that you can buy.

308
00:21:35,603 --> 00:21:37,890
Rym: Yep, and there's some demonstrations.

309
00:21:38,151 --> 00:21:39,234
Rym: Apparently it looks pretty good.

310
00:21:39,795 --> 00:21:44,870
Rym: So, uh in my if you were gonna buy a video card wait until these hit the street.

311
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:57,117
Scott: so I've seen what I think is pictures of the video cards and apparently I've seen some crazy things like fans on both sides or Cooling things Pre-attached custom whatever.

312
00:21:57,278 --> 00:22:01,230
Rym: well, I mean already my 1080 like I have the one that has the fans on it.

313
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:11,128
Rym: But if I got a second one for SLI, which I'm not gonna do anytime soon I would probably have gotten the intrinsically liquid-cooled one because you don't want to video cards pumping heat into your case.

314
00:22:11,448 --> 00:22:13,936
Scott: No So yeah, these are.

315
00:22:13,976 --> 00:22:16,809
Scott: these are coming now in other news slightly related news.

316
00:22:17,532 --> 00:22:23,150
Scott: Right before Nvidia made these announcements Intel announced that in 2020, so you called it.

317
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:27,163
Scott: We've been speculating on this which is actually like a year from now, right?

318
00:22:27,183 --> 00:22:29,470
Scott: Cuz 2018 is almost over so like a year and change.

319
00:22:30,451 --> 00:22:36,830
Scott: Of course Intel keeps fucking up their other CPU biz, so they might be in trouble, but they announced they're gonna make discrete GPUs.

320
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:42,750
Scott: You're gonna be able to buy an Intel GPU on a video card to go into your PCI Express slot.

321
00:22:43,092 --> 00:22:45,370
Scott: That's not gonna be some integrated Intel GPU.

322
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:49,083
Scott: It's supposedly gonna go head-to-head with these 20 80s or 21 80s or whatever they got.

323
00:22:52,352 --> 00:22:58,430
Scott: And that's gonna be interesting because if you listen to an old GeekNights I talked about how the real war is gonna be Intel versus Nvidia.

324
00:22:58,892 --> 00:23:04,632
Scott: We're just waiting for the other shoe to drop the other shoe being the Nvidia CPU.

325
00:23:04,793 --> 00:23:05,777
Scott: Nvidia CPU.

326
00:23:05,797 --> 00:23:08,470
Scott: we're gonna see a computer that is a hundred percent Nvidia chips.

327
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,849
Scott: And you know what if it came down to it in?

328
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:19,190
Scott: 2022 or whatever where I've got a choice between the computer with all Intel chips and the computer with all Nvidia chips I'm buying the all Nvidia chip.

329
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:20,554
Rym: Well, we'll see.

330
00:23:20,574 --> 00:23:25,590
Rym: cuz remember there was the era where Intel was basically overpriced and not getting that much faster.

331
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,883
Rym: And then AMD even though there's a lot of problems with their chips.

332
00:23:29,184 --> 00:23:30,670
Rym: They forced a competition.

333
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:34,150
Scott: They AMD is actually doing some really good stuff right now.

334
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:37,709
Scott: But it's not good stuff where I would build a name a PC with a hell.

335
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:41,670
Scott: no It's stuff where like you know they've got like I think there's a Chinese game console.

336
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:46,470
Scott: There's gonna be a big somewhat of a big deal that is buying their chips from AMD and stuff like that.

337
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,708
Scott: It's like they're making good chips.

338
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:57,830
Rym: But you saw as soon as AMD became a credible credible competitor in like the early 2000s Intel started Just leaps and bounds and way better chips way faster.

339
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:00,841
Scott: So Intel is definitely having hard times right now for reals.

340
00:24:00,861 --> 00:24:03,190
Scott: They cannot get those 10 nanometer chips out the fab.

341
00:24:03,511 --> 00:24:05,377
Scott: Yeah, they just can't do it there.

342
00:24:05,397 --> 00:24:14,607
Rym: and while I would recommend you wait until these Nvidia 2080s come out Like if you need a video card hold out a little bit, but the Intel there's according to this article.

343
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:15,489
Rym: This is all rumored.

344
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,863
Rym: Intel's first graphics card isn't gonna hit the street until 2020.

345
00:24:19,863 --> 00:24:20,506
Rym: I said that yeah.

346
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:25,081
Rym: So don't wait for the Intel chips if you need.

347
00:24:25,162 --> 00:24:27,730
Scott: if you need a gaming PC this games you got to play today.

348
00:24:28,612 --> 00:24:34,750
Scott: Right it's like what good does waiting a year or two years to buy a different Intel video card do for you?

349
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,690
Scott: You just missed out on two years of gaming.

350
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,508
Scott: That's worth more than the ten extra frames you could have.

351
00:24:39,568 --> 00:24:43,890
Rym: yeah The real question will be wait until the 2080 comes out and then make your choice.

352
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:49,670
Rym: Do you buy a discount 1080 which is probably still God tier or do you really need that ray tracing?

353
00:24:50,394 --> 00:24:56,250
Scott: It's God tier versus Even greater God God of God's tear.

354
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:05,576
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

355
00:25:05,596 --> 00:25:12,060
Rym: so Apparently there's a real big problem with levees in America like well in America.

356
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,000
Scott: Yeah, cuz you didn't pay enough money to make nice ones like they do in other parts of the world.

357
00:25:15,221 --> 00:25:17,689
Rym: No, the problem is that we are paying to make nice ones.

358
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:18,572
Rym: That's the problem.

359
00:25:18,593 --> 00:25:31,958
Rym: Oh finally now people won't get flooded great No, so it turns out that what is happening is that levees are being built Around neighborhoods that have money and towns that have money and not around places that don't.

360
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:37,300
Scott: yes But it's not just they just be defending the entire coastline that is threatened by flooding.

361
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,669
Scott: Regardless like the whole thing Scott all the way across.

362
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,460
Rym: how long is the coastline of like the Mississippi River?

363
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,499
Scott: I'm not saying the whole fucking river.

364
00:25:48,122 --> 00:25:49,145
Rym: So what part then?

365
00:25:49,807 --> 00:25:52,597
Rym: you should watch this video because the issue is way more complicated than you think.

366
00:25:52,637 --> 00:25:53,078
Rym: but here's the way.

367
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:54,141
Rym: here's the way Goes down.

368
00:25:54,503 --> 00:25:56,910
Rym: say you've got an area levees for the ocean.

369
00:25:57,452 --> 00:25:59,919
Rym: No, okay levees just a pile of like.

370
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:05,815
Rym: Anyway, levees are used primarily around rivers not around oceans.

371
00:26:05,955 --> 00:26:07,320
Rym: oceans tend to have seawalls.

372
00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:13,500
Rym: They may also be levees involved or berms like Disney in Anaheim has a big berm around it.

373
00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:16,520
Rym: So they can hide the fact that's in the middle of a city from all the people inside.

374
00:26:17,162 --> 00:26:23,560
Rym: But the problem with levees is that say there's a bunch of towns in an area and that area is prone to flooding.

375
00:26:24,596 --> 00:26:31,908
Rym: if One of those towns builds a levee around the entire town It not only protects that town from flooding.

376
00:26:32,349 --> 00:26:36,038
Rym: It makes flooding more common and way worse in all the other towns.

377
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:49,044
Rym: Yeah, if All the other towns build levees of the same height Then it makes flooding in the next set of towns down there or up the river a million times worse And even worse.

378
00:26:49,545 --> 00:26:54,039
Rym: if one of those towns makes a levee that's just like a foot taller that everyone else's levee.

379
00:26:54,501 --> 00:26:58,259
Rym: It totally fucks over every other person who has a levee over there.

380
00:26:59,043 --> 00:27:07,638
Rym: And the problem is because levees aren't really regulated in the u.s Or at least not very much and the Army Corps of Engineers does not have a lot of input into how they're built.

381
00:27:07,899 --> 00:27:22,340
Rym: mostly There's a whole levee war going on all around the u.s And basically upper middle-class white towns are getting flood protection at the expense of literally everyone else around them And it's making flooding way way worse.

382
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:32,540
Rym: So while climate change is definitely contributing to the increase in flooding damage and flooding in the u.s A big part of this increase is actually due to all these levees that were built after the last set of floods.

383
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,400
Scott: Well, I still say if you live in a flood place the Army Corps of Engineers shouldn't be building you a levee.

384
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,178
Scott: You should fucking move.

385
00:27:38,503 --> 00:27:39,880
Scott: Yeah, I do agree with that.

386
00:27:40,081 --> 00:27:44,558
Scott: And if you can't afford to move then we should take the money we were gonna spend on a levee and build.

387
00:27:44,638 --> 00:27:54,629
Scott: move your house Or build you a new house But this video... You shouldn't have to pay to move Right because in fact we should make the corporations that cause the global warming with their giant Smokestacks or whatever.

388
00:27:54,912 --> 00:27:55,840
Scott: they should pay for you to move.

389
00:27:56,122 --> 00:27:56,950
Rym: So anyway if you have a very...

390
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:57,999
Scott: Because they're the ones who flooded your house.

391
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:08,200
Rym: If you have a very simplistic view of this like Scott and you want to know the details and you want to know a little More this video actually goes into a lot of detail with a physical model about how this all works.

392
00:28:08,726 --> 00:28:10,040
Rym: And it's also fascinating.

393
00:28:10,823 --> 00:28:13,814
Scott: My house floods because your rich person levee is too big.

394
00:28:13,994 --> 00:28:15,400
Scott: You should pay to fix my flooded house.

395
00:28:17,002 --> 00:28:19,794
Rym: Yeah, you should watch this video and then you'll learn a lot about levees.

396
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:21,220
Rym: This is real good stuff.

397
00:28:21,421 --> 00:28:26,219
Scott: Also, if you're poor and the next town over with the rich people who built the levee go sabotage that shit.

398
00:28:28,503 --> 00:28:29,808
Scott: They think they all safe in their levee.

399
00:28:29,848 --> 00:28:30,130
Scott: they go.

400
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:30,812
Scott: they don't leave town.

401
00:28:30,853 --> 00:28:34,100
Scott: when the flood comes you leave town But meanwhile their levee leaking.

402
00:28:35,523 --> 00:28:36,552
Scott: So what do you got?

403
00:28:36,572 --> 00:28:37,097
Scott: What do I have?

404
00:28:37,117 --> 00:28:42,553
Rym: I forget You have a map of wireless passwords.

405
00:28:42,633 --> 00:28:42,974
Rym: Okay.

406
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:46,640
Scott: Yeah, we're gonna be flying soon to PAX West Yeah, and a lot of airports these days.

407
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,644
Scott: They got the free Wi-Fi.

408
00:28:47,724 --> 00:28:51,058
Scott: now I always got to turn on a VPN because you can't trust no airport Wi-Fi now.

409
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:56,600
Rym: frankly I cared about this a lot more like five years ago But now I have broadband on my phone no matter where I go.

410
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:02,013
Scott: Yeah, you got LTE usually like I literally don't care about Wi-Fi anymore But you know what Wi-Fi still saves you.

411
00:29:02,054 --> 00:29:08,166
Scott: on the data plan I've never I've never even come close to my basically unlimited data plan During months where I've traveled.

412
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:12,060
Scott: if I if I travel twice in the same month, that's what I get in trouble.

413
00:29:12,201 --> 00:29:14,153
Scott: This is where I get the text from Verizon.

414
00:29:14,173 --> 00:29:15,199
Scott: That's like you're getting close, bro.

415
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:21,751
Rym: Well, I run into the issue of if I'm not near a real city I have no signal because I'm on Teemo with the family plan.

416
00:29:21,771 --> 00:29:24,803
Scott: I basically just have unlimited data also like this iPad I'm holding right here.

417
00:29:24,823 --> 00:29:27,034
Scott: I did not pay extra to get the iPad with LTE.

418
00:29:27,094 --> 00:29:28,299
Scott: It's a Wi-Fi only iPad.

419
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:33,887
Scott: No, you know, maybe you got your switch with you and you want to download a new game Tether to my phone.

420
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:35,135
Scott: you could you could do that.

421
00:29:35,155 --> 00:29:35,820
Rym: That's just what I do.

422
00:29:36,021 --> 00:29:38,670
Scott: I could do that with my iPad also, but anyway, the point is so.

423
00:29:39,453 --> 00:29:40,135
Scott: you need Wi-Fi.

424
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:41,360
Scott: Sometimes it's good to have Wi-Fi.

425
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,575
Scott: Sometimes right, you know and you go to airport.

426
00:29:44,635 --> 00:29:51,451
Scott: some of them got free Wi-Fi Some of them don't but most of the airports especially in the luxury Little clubs for the people in first class.

427
00:29:51,471 --> 00:29:53,560
Rym: Usually you'll see a lot of access point.

428
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,134
Rym: That's like pay us money bullshit or free Wi-Fi.

429
00:29:57,154 --> 00:29:58,440
Rym: That's so slow doesn't actually work.

430
00:29:59,162 --> 00:30:03,015
Rym: Then you'll see one that's like something something - lounge like Emirates loud.

431
00:30:03,056 --> 00:30:03,316
Rym: Yeah.

432
00:30:03,357 --> 00:30:04,320
Scott: Well, here we go.

433
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:13,769
Scott: There's a website where people who are very generous who have access to those Wi-Fi passwords have collected and published those Wi-Fi Passwords which are unlikely to change.

434
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:14,312
Scott: Yep.

435
00:30:14,573 --> 00:30:14,995
Rym: I've only.

436
00:30:15,035 --> 00:30:20,864
Rym: there's only one lounge I've ever been in where literally every time I went into that lounge The password was different.

437
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:30,464
Scott: my favorite is when you go to a place and the password has the year in it and the year Is like 2014 like yeah, our password is our name of restaurant 2014.

438
00:30:30,464 --> 00:30:33,693
Scott: It's like uh-huh I know when you bought your Wi-Fi access point and I could.

439
00:30:33,773 --> 00:30:38,764
Scott: I could probably tell it only has 802 11 G because when you bought it I've had good luck using.

440
00:30:38,784 --> 00:30:48,215
Rym: you don't got no an name of airline and whatever the letters are these days name of airline and pick random years or name of rewards club and random years.

441
00:30:48,235 --> 00:30:49,760
Rym: Yeah, that's worked for me very well.

442
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:56,620
Scott: Anyway, if you go to an airport, you know And you find yourself needing some Wi-Fi and you're not liking the Wi-Fi that's available and you see some access points.

443
00:30:57,001 --> 00:31:04,163
Scott: Just remember this URL visit this URL on you know, LTE or use this an app You can get.

444
00:31:04,204 --> 00:31:06,079
Scott: they have Android and App Store apps.

445
00:31:06,381 --> 00:31:11,496
Scott: You can get the database load it up before your trip and then look up the the passwords when.

446
00:31:11,576 --> 00:31:19,038
Rym: this is the kind of project I love kind of like how I would love to see a project that did the same thing for The codes to bathrooms in public buildings.

447
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,920
Scott: Oh, yeah I think the people who use this the most are people who are like pilots and flight attendants.

448
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:30,340
Rym: Yeah, people who are trapped flight crews They're people who are or people who have a lot of business travel, but don't work for a fancy company, right?

449
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:33,039
Scott: But now you can take advantage and now, you know, you're in the club with them.

450
00:31:33,368 --> 00:31:44,180
Scott: Yeah Find some pretty much sets a rule in life And generally if this if you're about to do something that you don't do often But other people do do often find those people who do it often and they tell you secrets.

451
00:31:44,743 --> 00:31:52,180
Rym: Yeah, believe me like if you're if you're ever flying in weird countries I can tell you a lot of airport secrets and our friend Sherba has got a lot more secrets than I have.

452
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:55,753
Rym: In the moment, the book club book is no longer the Odyssey.

453
00:31:55,814 --> 00:32:01,834
Rym: It's now the Space Odyssey We are going to be in not that many days.

454
00:32:01,894 --> 00:32:11,754
Scott: in other book club news the as predicted the third book of the NK, Jefferson's trilogy won the Hugo Award for the trifecta.

455
00:32:11,774 --> 00:32:13,540
Scott: Yeah, which has never been done before.

456
00:32:14,123 --> 00:32:15,188
Rym: I can say why.

457
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,740
Rym: it's really really really fucking good, right?

458
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:23,219
Scott: So if you don't remember the first one was a book club selection, so you can read the other two.

459
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:30,993
Rym: It's as nuanced as the culture sci-fi with a good perspective And it also is as full as End of Evangelion.

460
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:38,498
Rym: in terms of you want to know what happens Let's go also see our previous discussion of Hugo Nonsense.

461
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:42,150
Rym: We will also be live at PAX West.

462
00:32:42,491 --> 00:32:43,695
Scott: it's coming up too soon.

463
00:32:43,715 --> 00:32:44,798
Scott: I got pax fever right now.

464
00:32:44,878 --> 00:32:48,991
Rym: Oh my god It's real hard to do anything but think about packs.

465
00:32:49,071 --> 00:32:49,614
Rym: It's coming.

466
00:32:49,774 --> 00:32:49,935
Scott: Yep.

467
00:32:50,116 --> 00:32:50,819
Rym: We're gonna be there.

468
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,008
Rym: You're gonna be in tabletop most of the packs.

469
00:32:53,229 --> 00:32:55,176
Rym: Yep, and on Monday at 10 a.m.

470
00:32:55,256 --> 00:32:58,950
Rym: Pacific time We were doing the updated 40 tabletop games.

471
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:01,800
Rym: You must play and it will stream live on twitch.

472
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:03,085
Scott: We don't know which twitch.

473
00:33:03,306 --> 00:33:06,980
Rym: some packs twitch problem guessing either packs two or packs three.

474
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:10,560
Scott: So figure out which one it is and subscribe to it for five bucks for the one month.

475
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,051
Rym: Yes, I did not want you to have to watch an ad.

476
00:33:13,112 --> 00:33:14,900
Rym: That's right to watch our pan.

477
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,312
Scott: They also shouldn't be showing any ad while well on twitch.

478
00:33:17,352 --> 00:33:18,940
Scott: You can manually control when the ads play.

479
00:33:19,322 --> 00:33:23,139
Scott: Oh, they play an ad in the middle of our panel as opposed to before and after it.

480
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,207
Scott: I assume they'll be doing it before and after.

481
00:33:25,287 --> 00:33:27,274
Rym: so, uh all I can say.

482
00:33:27,294 --> 00:33:34,280
Rym: I don't know if this is still their policy But when I did enforcing I there was the time when I was in charge of the ads.

483
00:33:34,845 --> 00:33:36,220
Rym: I was actually making the ads play.

484
00:33:36,984 --> 00:33:40,179
Rym: We had to make a lot of them play during panels like right in the middle of them.

485
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:49,375
Rym: Yeah to try to get people to subscribe to not miss parts of the panel Mm-hmm, like the med the the company whose panel it was was like, yep.

486
00:33:49,536 --> 00:33:50,680
Rym: That is our strategy.

487
00:33:51,082 --> 00:33:55,563
Scott: I mean, we thought I was like news, but honestly, I actually because of the twitch prime I actually forgot.

488
00:33:55,603 --> 00:33:56,688
Scott: the twitch even had ads.

489
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:57,149
Rym: Yeah.

490
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:03,032
Scott: Yeah until I saw the news today then it was like, oh my god Clicked on a YouTube video at work like a few days.

491
00:34:03,072 --> 00:34:03,876
Scott: Oh, you weren't logged in.

492
00:34:03,896 --> 00:34:05,780
Rym: Yeah, I wasn't logged I wasn't even thinking about it.

493
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,855
Rym: I can't run ad block at work because ad block could leak data like ad blocks.

494
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:13,100
Rym: actually not that safe Depending on how it's implemented.

495
00:34:14,161 --> 00:34:17,540
Rym: But anyway, so it's not like I'm just browsing random crap on my work computer.

496
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,886
Rym: I have a laptop I can use for that.

497
00:34:19,147 --> 00:34:23,386
Rym: but I clicked on a YouTube video and an ad appeared and Literally, it took me a second to be like.

498
00:34:23,426 --> 00:34:23,607
Rym: what?

499
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:24,570
Rym: what ads?

500
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:29,302
Rym: I haven't seen a YouTube ad Mm-hmm in Mm-hmm.

501
00:34:29,543 --> 00:34:36,348
Rym: I can't remember the last time I saw a YouTube ad and I saw it and I couldn't even skip it for like a Minute and I didn't know what to do.

502
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,475
Scott: pay for YouTube red.

503
00:34:37,857 --> 00:34:38,219
Scott: It's worth it.

504
00:34:38,481 --> 00:34:41,960
Rym: No, I just closed the tab and whatever video is YouTube red is barely more.

505
00:34:42,302 --> 00:34:45,036
Scott: I think it's around the cost of subscribing to one twitch channel.

506
00:34:45,118 --> 00:34:51,340
Rym: So But also good ad block just works on YouTube like the HD PC is not logged into my YouTube red.

507
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,188
Scott: Yeah, I hope some.

508
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:53,219
Scott: I hope ad block works.

509
00:34:54,302 --> 00:35:02,102
Rym: Yeah, so far ad block still works on YouTube, which I'm very Happy about and I'm curious if it'll ever stop working Like.

510
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:06,312
Rym: I really wonder Google could trivially make it stop working maybe and they haven't.

511
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:15,267
Rym: so there's a lot of issues with Twitter Lately if you didn't notice, but we're not gonna talk about the Nazis That we you know about the Nazis.

512
00:35:15,287 --> 00:35:20,180
Rym: We're not gonna talk about how the leadership of Twitter seems pretty okay with Nazis.

513
00:35:20,562 --> 00:35:22,800
Rym: That whole thing is a separate problem with Twitter.

514
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:27,539
Rym: no, we're gonna talk about something very specific because this actually affects a lot of people who use Twitter.

515
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:37,900
Rym: and The only other point I want to make that I don't want to address in this show is that we're not gonna talk about Leaving Twitter for something like mastodon because for most people that is not a viable option.

516
00:35:38,482 --> 00:35:42,278
Scott: So Twitter's made a few changes to the way Twitter works recently.

517
00:35:42,298 --> 00:35:49,100
Scott: Yeah And some of those changes were like, you know, whatever right not super big deal.

518
00:35:49,603 --> 00:35:52,080
Scott: But then there were some changes they announced many months ago.

519
00:35:52,100 --> 00:36:01,080
Scott: I don't know if we talked about them when they announced them way back But they finally happened and what they've done is they've changed the way that third-party Twitter clients work.

520
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,527
Scott: They limited the features that are available to them.

521
00:36:03,568 --> 00:36:05,253
Scott: They cut off some legacy API's.

522
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,560
Rym: now things like this been happening for a long time.

523
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,566
Rym: Twitter, I believe they have multiple API platforms.

524
00:36:09,586 --> 00:36:16,560
Rym: They basically never migrated any new functionality to the platform That was accessible to third-party apps, right?

525
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:20,240
Scott: So that the thing that they removed first that wasn't part of this, right?

526
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,791
Scott: It's a separate removal was the auto posting from Twitter to Facebook.

527
00:36:23,972 --> 00:36:26,520
Scott: Yeah, but it's like you can actually code that yourself.

528
00:36:27,021 --> 00:36:27,583
Scott: It's not hard.

529
00:36:27,964 --> 00:36:30,652
Scott: You could also actually do an IFT.

530
00:36:30,672 --> 00:36:31,795
Scott: TT I think can do that.

531
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:33,440
Scott: So it's not really a big deal.

532
00:36:33,621 --> 00:36:36,633
Scott: I do know some people that used it, but it's like whatever right?

533
00:36:36,693 --> 00:36:48,340
Scott: It's like, you know, you know And it's kind of weird to have you know, two competing companies and you have your thing automatically Send your content to the other company, right?

534
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,066
Scott: it was kind of weird that that existed to begin with.

535
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:55,980
Scott: but the thing that this separately the big deal is that They change the way third-party clients work.

536
00:36:56,141 --> 00:37:03,740
Scott: So if you don't want to use the real Twitter client Which you shouldn't do not use the real legit Twitter client because it is full of ads and it's awful.

537
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,005
Scott: It doesn't show you tweets in order.

538
00:37:05,246 --> 00:37:06,330
Scott: It shows you a bunch of bullshit.

539
00:37:06,611 --> 00:37:07,956
Scott: You should not be using it.

540
00:37:08,197 --> 00:37:08,839
Rym: Yep, right?

541
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,840
Rym: Increasingly, I think there won't be third-party apps that work.

542
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:21,780
Scott: Twitter acknowledged in fact in their sort of messaging about this that like hey You know third-party Twitter apps were there before legit ones were right?

543
00:37:23,102 --> 00:37:26,780
Scott: And they invented like all the UI and everything that people are used to on Twitter.

544
00:37:27,563 --> 00:37:29,210
Scott: So we're very thankful to them.

545
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:29,472
Scott: right?

546
00:37:29,552 --> 00:37:34,920
Scott: because basically really, you know Usually what happens is you have the real client and then third-party ones come along later.

547
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,107
Scott: But like no the third-party ones actually came first.

548
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:43,819
Scott: the Twitter client the real the legit one could at the official one Could actually be seen as a clone of the third-party ones.

549
00:37:44,401 --> 00:37:46,266
Scott: Alright, but anyway, so what they've?

550
00:37:46,286 --> 00:37:48,592
Scott: they removed the following features right number one.

551
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:51,820
Scott: You can't get live feed update now.

552
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,759
Scott: What the hell is this mean?

553
00:37:53,020 --> 00:38:02,780
Scott: It means that if you open up your Twitter and you put it in live mode like as people tweet They will just fucking appear like instantly and you could sit there watching the tweets flow in like a river.

554
00:38:02,821 --> 00:38:03,679
Rym: That's really useful.

555
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:16,860
Scott: For example, if you're curating a convention and you're like monitoring the tweets and putting them up on a board or something It's supposedly useful if you are watching television or like a sport event and you want seeing the tweets come in as things happen.

556
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,580
Scott: Yeah, but I never use that feature.

557
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,206
Scott: So I don't shit and I don't really.

558
00:38:20,226 --> 00:38:22,454
Scott: that's like if I was running a convention.

559
00:38:22,555 --> 00:38:25,264
Scott: then actually you could you know Or you're putting up on a board.

560
00:38:25,284 --> 00:38:29,800
Scott: then you could actually just use the legit Twitter client for that or write a special, right?

561
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,708
Scott: it's like you don't really need the Third-party client to do that feature.

562
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:36,520
Scott: right who sits there watching tweets coming live on their phone?

563
00:38:37,142 --> 00:38:39,530
Scott: It's like I don't feel like that's a big deal that they remove that.

564
00:38:40,232 --> 00:38:44,568
Scott: the second thing they removed which is somewhat of a bigger Deal is the push notification.

565
00:38:44,709 --> 00:38:47,800
Scott: So you can't get push notifications anymore.

566
00:38:48,123 --> 00:38:54,920
Scott: It's like it used to be like someone like your tweet And if you had enabled you'd immediately your third-party client could like ding Rym like your tweet.

567
00:38:55,161 --> 00:39:00,500
Scott: Yeah, and if somebody tweeted at you or DM do you be like ding someone tweeted at you now?

568
00:39:01,001 --> 00:39:03,974
Scott: You actually still get the notifications for ads and DMS.

569
00:39:04,276 --> 00:39:05,300
Scott: They'll just be delayed.

570
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:11,580
Scott: They won't be real-time which is totally fine because those are the only two things I ever had notifications enabled for.

571
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:16,931
Scott: You know, I don't want to be notified about a like or a retweet My phone will be going ding ding ding ding ding.

572
00:39:17,193 --> 00:39:22,297
Rym: It could be annoying for DMS But frankly you should not be using Twitter as a primary means of communication.

573
00:39:22,337 --> 00:39:22,679
Scott: DMS.

574
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:22,940
Scott: You're right?

575
00:39:23,001 --> 00:39:24,300
Scott: Well, yeah, but it's like yeah, okay.

576
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:29,206
Scott: So even if you don't get your DM notification instantly, which is slightly annoying It's like it's gonna.

577
00:39:29,386 --> 00:39:30,954
Scott: you're gonna get the notification like a minute.

578
00:39:31,074 --> 00:39:32,340
Scott: It's like what's your hurry, right?

579
00:39:32,441 --> 00:39:35,140
Scott: So my Rym at me do I need to add in it on Twitter?

580
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,594
Scott: Do I need to know about it instantly or a minute later?

581
00:39:37,615 --> 00:39:38,360
Scott: Is that a big deal?

582
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:46,220
Rym: You can use Google Hangout or I'm gonna use a more real-time direct protocol to communicate right?

583
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,654
Scott: So the features they removed have a lot of people mad, but honestly, I'm not.

584
00:39:51,035 --> 00:39:52,380
Scott: why do you need any of those features?

585
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,562
Scott: The client.

586
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:54,305
Scott: I don't see why.

587
00:39:54,325 --> 00:40:02,240
Scott: and as we said if you use the third-party client you see no ads and you see all the tweets from the people you follow in order like you're supposed to and you don't see any bullshit.

588
00:40:02,461 --> 00:40:03,143
Scott: You don't see tweets.

589
00:40:03,163 --> 00:40:04,327
Scott: You missed while you're away.

590
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:08,440
Scott: You don't see suggested whatever right some people mad that like.

591
00:40:08,581 --> 00:40:10,313
Scott: Oh, you got to pay for these third-party clients.

592
00:40:10,414 --> 00:40:11,260
Scott: I paid for tweet bot.

593
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:15,675
Scott: I think it might have even cost $10, but I use that app a lot.

594
00:40:15,835 --> 00:40:16,658
Scott: I never had to pay $10 again.

595
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,263
Scott: It's not a subscription.

596
00:40:18,284 --> 00:40:21,214
Scott: No, right you I'd pay more for Amazon.

597
00:40:21,254 --> 00:40:27,355
Scott: literally every other subscription $10 once the cost of like five to breakfast sandwiches.

598
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:28,980
Scott: never see ads on Twitter again.

599
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:33,277
Scott: See all tweets in order right and I'm only missing out on the features that I just mentioned.

600
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:33,960
Scott: that I don't care about.

601
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:37,454
Rym: So does because it looks like polls don't work through the API.

602
00:40:37,474 --> 00:40:39,432
Scott: They've never really worked through the API I don't care.

603
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:46,440
Rym: Well, so pretty much any new feature Twitter ever added for at least six years just isn't available to third-party clients.

604
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,173
Scott: Yeah, no tweet, but polls have never worked and I've never tried to use them.

605
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:50,500
Scott: I don't care who cares about polls?

606
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:51,727
Rym: No, do you just not see polls?

607
00:40:51,787 --> 00:40:52,632
Rym: I've seen some good polls.

608
00:40:52,813 --> 00:40:53,436
Scott: I don't use polls.

609
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:54,020
Rym: I use polls.

610
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:56,499
Rym: I think I guess you wouldn't know because you don't see them.

611
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:57,886
Scott: I can.

612
00:40:57,927 --> 00:41:04,253
Scott: sometimes you can tell when a poll a tweet has a poll in it But you know, oh you're using the real Twitter client and seeing ads and bullshit now.

613
00:41:06,361 --> 00:41:08,980
Rym: So actually I almost there's almost never ads.

614
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:16,880
Scott: uh-huh, like I literally like I use the real Twitter client which I have on my phone because my tweets are in order but I Don't use it and I have all notifications disabled.

615
00:41:17,382 --> 00:41:20,110
Scott: But if I open it this mad bullshit in there see.

616
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:25,610
Rym: so the only bullshit that I see right now is I do see The likes of some of my friends.

617
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:26,936
Rym: that nonsense I don't see that.

618
00:41:27,137 --> 00:41:27,699
Rym: Yeah, but that's it.

619
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,520
Scott: Otherwise, you don't see sponsored tweets.

620
00:41:29,841 --> 00:41:32,690
Rym: So I see maybe one sponsored tweet a day.

621
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:37,304
Rym: because what I've been doing now that I started using the original Twitter app again I started using it a few weeks ago.

622
00:41:37,325 --> 00:41:37,746
Rym: Uh-huh.

623
00:41:37,886 --> 00:41:41,800
Rym: Partly because the third-party app I was using started not working that well.

624
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,566
Scott: Well, that's what you have.

625
00:41:42,647 --> 00:41:42,868
Scott: Android.

626
00:41:42,889 --> 00:41:46,088
Scott: it gets heat but on the iPhone is yeah I don't know which one's good on Android.

627
00:41:46,148 --> 00:41:47,012
Rym: none of them as far as like.

628
00:41:47,032 --> 00:41:49,846
Rym: they're all kind of shitty on Android and the biggest Problem is a lot of them.

629
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:54,131
Rym: if you're not connected to the internet They just don't really.

630
00:41:54,151 --> 00:41:55,880
Scott: I went to my feet on the real Twitter app.

631
00:41:56,081 --> 00:41:58,129
Scott: Yeah, the first tweet is from some anime.

632
00:41:58,189 --> 00:41:59,394
Scott: The second one is an ad.

633
00:41:59,414 --> 00:42:00,056
Scott: I don't.

634
00:42:01,361 --> 00:42:04,649
Scott: Okay, how many more I'm gonna scroll down like the second?

635
00:42:04,709 --> 00:42:09,884
Scott: the second tweet is a promoted tweet two three four All right.

636
00:42:09,904 --> 00:42:11,811
Rym: I've just rolled past 30 tweets 40.

637
00:42:11,811 --> 00:42:14,160
Rym: Hey, I still don't say any promoted tweets.

638
00:42:14,521 --> 00:42:18,294
Scott: Oh, there's an 8. so 10 every 10th tweet down was a promoted tweet.

639
00:42:18,294 --> 00:42:21,749
Scott: 11 12 13 See I'm not.

640
00:42:21,769 --> 00:42:28,860
Scott: I don't see that 16 Every 10 tweets is a promoted tweet on the official Twitter.

641
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,613
Rym: So I've just scrolled past hundreds of tweets and I've seen one.

642
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:34,706
Scott: see that I don't believe you I Can't see from here.

643
00:42:34,726 --> 00:42:36,479
Rym: I mean you can scroll through and look for one.

644
00:42:36,499 --> 00:42:36,580
Rym: now.

645
00:42:37,322 --> 00:42:43,240
Rym: difference is what I've been doing is Every time I see an ad I block the account.

646
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:50,226
Scott: So I tried to do that way back before I paid the $10 for the the third party And it didn't work.

647
00:42:50,347 --> 00:42:53,380
Scott: actually even though I blocked promoted tweets wouldn't be blocked.

648
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,086
Rym: So I don't see.

649
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:57,333
Rym: I've not seen any promoted tweet from an account.

650
00:42:57,353 --> 00:42:59,240
Rym: I've blocked since I started doing this.

651
00:42:59,462 --> 00:43:00,838
Scott: Maybe they actually made that work.

652
00:43:01,381 --> 00:43:10,279
Rym: But and more importantly also now that accounts blocked so I won't see it if anyone retweets it Which is fine because if someone's willing to buy an ad on Twitter, I don't want to see their tweets.

653
00:43:11,501 --> 00:43:14,452
Scott: See the only annoying reason on Rym's Twitter app here.

654
00:43:14,492 --> 00:43:16,880
Scott: I don't see nearly as many promoted to me as Ron mine.

655
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,746
Scott: I saw promoted tweets every 10th tweet.

656
00:43:18,906 --> 00:43:19,167
Scott: Either.

657
00:43:19,287 --> 00:43:22,297
Rym: You are a more lucrative potential eyeball.

658
00:43:22,357 --> 00:43:22,718
Scott: I don't know.

659
00:43:22,738 --> 00:43:23,259
Scott: take your phone back.

660
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:27,796
Rym: Or I've blocked so many accounts that no one can advertise to me.

661
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:28,540
Scott: I don't know.

662
00:43:29,022 --> 00:43:29,304
Scott: I don't know.

663
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:30,311
Scott: But yeah, I was.

664
00:43:30,472 --> 00:43:34,900
Scott: I mean, I haven't used the app So I mean like there was a brief period where I was using it and blocking all this.

665
00:43:35,742 --> 00:43:41,960
Rym: Honestly, the only problem I have with the regular Twitter app today on Android is that I see the likes of other people.

666
00:43:42,604 --> 00:43:44,073
Rym: I think that is a terrible feature.

667
00:43:44,093 --> 00:43:45,160
Rym: I'm still really mad about it.

668
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:53,448
Scott: I think what I might do is since I have the real Twitter app like they're just not being used I might enable The notifications in it, right?

669
00:43:54,352 --> 00:43:55,355
Rym: Oh, I see what you're doing.

670
00:43:55,536 --> 00:43:56,580
Scott: Then I see notification.

671
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:57,806
Scott: That's like hey Rym added you.

672
00:43:57,846 --> 00:44:00,759
Scott: I get it immediately and then I open up my other Twitter app.

673
00:44:01,181 --> 00:44:04,554
Rym: But I think there's a much more fundamental issue here because I think this is going to get worse.

674
00:44:04,855 --> 00:44:10,771
Rym: I would believe that Twitter will eventually just not provide API's to third parties at all.

675
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:12,155
Scott: They're definitely getting there gradually.

676
00:44:12,175 --> 00:44:28,820
Rym: Yeah, they're going towards it and This is analogous to a fundamental issue that comes up time and time and time again on the internet the difference between a proprietary Client and a universal clients as in do you use a special app to connect to a service?

677
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,926
Scott: This is why everyone wants you to install their app.

678
00:44:31,086 --> 00:44:35,620
Rym: So there's a web browser that can literally access everything everywhere forever, right?

679
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,192
Scott: It's like why does Twitter want you so badly to use the Twitter app?

680
00:44:39,353 --> 00:44:44,420
Scott: because if you actually use twitter.com Why do they keep what is every website in the world when their app is free?

681
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,062
Scott: It doesn't cost.

682
00:44:45,343 --> 00:44:46,749
Scott: they don't make any money when you use it.

683
00:44:46,769 --> 00:44:49,280
Scott: Why are they pushing you so hard to install their app?

684
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:49,902
Rym: Oh, hey, look, it's.

685
00:44:49,963 --> 00:44:55,136
Rym: I just went to Twitter on the web and I see one ad for Land Rover Which I'm gonna block right now.

686
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,387
Scott: Why are you giving advertising to somebody?

687
00:44:58,527 --> 00:44:58,969
Scott: I just like.

688
00:44:59,009 --> 00:44:59,831
Scott: they said their name though.

689
00:45:00,172 --> 00:45:00,393
Rym: Yeah.

690
00:45:00,634 --> 00:45:01,356
Rym: Yeah, you know what.

691
00:45:01,416 --> 00:45:02,580
Rym: don't buy Land Rover cars.

692
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,343
Rym: They're garbage.

693
00:45:03,383 --> 00:45:04,086
Scott: That's negative.

694
00:45:04,126 --> 00:45:05,130
Scott: Attention is good attention.

695
00:45:05,271 --> 00:45:07,560
Rym: You know, there's actually not a lot of evidence that that's true.

696
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,225
Scott: I'm just saying don't?

697
00:45:08,426 --> 00:45:08,788
Scott: I don't like.

698
00:45:09,211 --> 00:45:13,435
Scott: you didn't even said Yeah, you got blurred out like beep it out in the show.

699
00:45:13,455 --> 00:45:16,951
Scott: I formally You should bleep it out in the show.

700
00:45:16,991 --> 00:45:17,855
Scott: Just like it's Korean TV.

701
00:45:17,895 --> 00:45:23,394
Rym: We officially Give the opposite of an endorsement for Land Rover.

702
00:45:23,435 --> 00:45:24,600
Rym: do not buy a Land Rover.

703
00:45:24,781 --> 00:45:26,046
Scott: I actually yeah, those are.

704
00:45:26,206 --> 00:45:30,901
Scott: it's like it's a big car that guzzles a lot of gas like anyone who owns one even.

705
00:45:31,488 --> 00:45:47,700
Rym: but the Fundamental contract on the web the World Wide Web, which is not the internet, you know We've done shows about this like a decade ago Is that you can use any client you want to access web content and the client has?

706
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:52,300
Rym: 100% control over how that content is rendered and displayed.

707
00:45:52,721 --> 00:45:55,909
Rym: The content is marked up and the web browser can do whatever it wants.

708
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:59,759
Rym: That is why web browsers have adblock but apps don't.

709
00:46:00,562 --> 00:46:05,891
Rym: That is why most apps that say they'll do app web blocking or ad blocking Usually just scams.

710
00:46:06,354 --> 00:46:07,180
Rym: They're stealing your data.

711
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:13,900
Scott: They're way to block ads in an app is with a proxy server with like a VPN or something, right?

712
00:46:14,621 --> 00:46:16,298
Scott: The VPN part isn't totally necessary.

713
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:34,972
Scott: But as you get a proxy so all the internet because even the apps are using HTTP requests in the background Right, so you just be software running on your phone or your computer Isn't you know, you can't put a plug-in in the app So you can't block the ads at that level of the of the transaction.

714
00:46:35,373 --> 00:46:44,780
Scott: but a proxy will actually look at the rod You know tweet data coming in from you know on your router Right before it gets to your phone and then remove all the ads.

715
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:52,012
Scott: But then when you go to the airport and use the Wi-Fi password that you just got from that website So Scott you're gonna see ads again from a security and data leakage perspective.

716
00:46:52,052 --> 00:46:53,276
Rym: How does that handle TLS?

717
00:46:53,336 --> 00:46:54,540
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

718
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:56,789
Scott: That's why you got a. it's a little shady.

719
00:46:57,171 --> 00:47:01,058
Scott: Yeah, this is the problem in your house But it's not gonna work at that, you know.

720
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:10,963
Rym: But so like Twitter on the web I Could just futz with the way my web browser renders and basically make a third-party client that just renders the Twitter page differently Mm-hmm.

721
00:47:11,265 --> 00:47:11,808
Rym: That is like.

722
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:21,020
Rym: that is the core fundamental Contract of how the web is work does work and should work and anything that violates that is a very different thing, right?

723
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:26,200
Scott: Well, what's happened is people have gone from making web pages, right because mostly cuz everyone's using phones.

724
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,124
Rym: Yeah, what was that tweet?

725
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:27,888
Rym: I saw a while ago.

726
00:47:27,908 --> 00:47:30,380
Rym: I feel like there used to be more web pages, right?

727
00:47:31,503 --> 00:47:41,778
Scott: And now instead they make an API Right, and then what they do with that API is they have an authentication mechanism on it So that it's not just an open API that everyone can just hit all they want.

728
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:43,419
Scott: Yeah It's this wrist, you know.

729
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:50,040
Scott: And then they put limits and all sorts of other things on each user that is hitting the API.

730
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,228
Scott: So it's like alright your third-party app.

731
00:47:52,248 --> 00:47:53,894
Scott: You got this one API user.

732
00:47:54,135 --> 00:47:55,420
Scott: You can only make extra quests.

733
00:47:55,521 --> 00:47:57,319
Scott: You can only hit these endpoints, right?

734
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:02,597
Scott: But meanwhile the website itself right when you go to use that it doesn't have any limits.

735
00:48:02,677 --> 00:48:04,985
Scott: as an API user It could do all this fancy stuff.

736
00:48:05,066 --> 00:48:06,532
Scott: If you use the official stuff.

737
00:48:06,652 --> 00:48:08,520
Scott: Yeah, so that's that's how they get you.

738
00:48:08,641 --> 00:48:10,580
Rym: So why are companies doing this?

739
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,593
Rym: Why are they trying to pull us back from the height of the web?

740
00:48:13,633 --> 00:48:15,140
Rym: being an open platform can't make money.

741
00:48:16,103 --> 00:48:16,684
Scott: They need cave.

742
00:48:16,724 --> 00:48:16,905
Scott: they've.

743
00:48:17,306 --> 00:48:21,899
Scott: since the web was made they've been trying to make it less like the web and more like cable TV.

744
00:48:22,307 --> 00:48:25,607
Scott: Yeah they're trying to push content on you instead of you.

745
00:48:25,647 --> 00:48:34,651
Rym: the idea that the web browser is the renderer of their content is Literally against their core ways to monetize.

746
00:48:35,133 --> 00:48:37,100
Rym: like they the web browser is their enemy.

747
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:47,319
Rym: they want to get eyeballs off the web browser and onto their proprietary platforms and It's a bad trend and I think it's only going to accelerate and I don't know how much we can do about it.

748
00:48:48,244 --> 00:48:50,316
Rym: I mean if Twitter didn't have a web client.

749
00:48:50,336 --> 00:48:50,899
Rym: I wouldn't use it.

750
00:48:51,402 --> 00:48:55,180
Rym: Yeah, I mean if I actually use the web browser is my primary Twitter client.

751
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:59,562
Rym: I look at Twitter on a computer in Chrome more often than I look at it on my phone I do.

752
00:48:59,623 --> 00:49:01,760
Scott: I just use tweet deck so I don't see ads.

753
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,953
Rym: Oh, yeah, I use tweet deck, but I also use regular Twitter.

754
00:49:03,993 --> 00:49:05,080
Scott: I don't go to twitter.com.

755
00:49:05,341 --> 00:49:05,784
Rym: I do that.

756
00:49:05,885 --> 00:49:07,335
Rym: I don't see ads apparently.

757
00:49:07,355 --> 00:49:09,562
Rym: I don't know why you see Block.

758
00:49:09,603 --> 00:49:10,024
Scott: you do that.

759
00:49:10,144 --> 00:49:12,673
Scott: Well, you don't yeah, he's all promoted tweet.

760
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:13,796
Rym: Yeah, and I blocked it.

761
00:49:13,837 --> 00:49:17,993
Scott: I see so few of them I don't know, but I just don't go to twitter.com.

762
00:49:18,033 --> 00:49:20,244
Scott: I use a tweet deck so I don't see any ads.

763
00:49:20,305 --> 00:49:28,940
Rym: but Twitter doesn't know how to make money and They're definitely not gonna try to charge us to use Twitter Even though I think that is literally the best possible solution.

764
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:32,464
Rym: Like I think charging money for Twitter would solve Every problem.

765
00:49:32,484 --> 00:49:34,792
Rym: Twitter has it but it would not solve the problem.

766
00:49:34,812 --> 00:49:36,177
Rym: The VCS are invested in Twitter.

767
00:49:36,498 --> 00:49:37,040
Scott: Don't fuck them.

768
00:49:37,383 --> 00:49:41,858
Rym: Yeah, I'm very much Indifferent to their concern shall we say.

769
00:49:43,401 --> 00:49:48,440
Rym: But this is the opening salvo and what's going to become an increasingly desperate opening salvo.

770
00:49:48,601 --> 00:49:49,640
Scott: This war has been going on.

771
00:49:49,841 --> 00:49:53,362
Rym: This is the opening salvo as far as a lot of people have ever been aware Like there's.

772
00:49:53,382 --> 00:49:54,808
Scott: this is an opening salvo.

773
00:49:54,949 --> 00:49:57,420
Scott: and see it's a war that's been going on since the late night.

774
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:57,762
Scott: You know what?

775
00:49:57,782 --> 00:50:00,560
Rym: I'll put it differently, but there's been going on for a long time.

776
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,220
Scott: There's a new battle a big battle that is starting up.

777
00:50:03,341 --> 00:50:04,979
Scott: It was it was a little quiet for a while.

778
00:50:05,341 --> 00:50:09,960
Rym: This war has been going on for a long time, but suddenly a battleship showed up on the horizon.

779
00:50:10,261 --> 00:50:15,740
Rym: Oh, yeah, and it just fired a barrage into the land where up until this point the war had been invisible.

780
00:50:16,001 --> 00:50:20,798
Rym: Yep, because now regular ass people are using regular ass third-party clients.

781
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:23,373
Rym: suddenly There are things not working and they want to know why.

782
00:50:23,675 --> 00:50:24,460
Scott: This war hasn't ended.

783
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:27,592
Scott: I've been playing cards in the barracks, but yeah, we picked up the guns.

784
00:50:27,833 --> 00:50:32,403
Rym: So welcome to the war I think about.

785
00:50:32,483 --> 00:51:03,886
Rym: so from now on I mean the only real advice I can give you because we're running out of time on the show is that Wherever possible if you see a website that's trying to get you to use an app Try to figure out what the specific rationalization is for them to get you to use the app And if the app is actually a better user experience for you and wherever possible Resist the urge to use an app over a generic access website unless you personally have a self-invested reason to do so.

786
00:51:04,527 --> 00:51:17,101
Rym: don't migrate because they tell you to or because they try to coerce you to have a good reason for it and be aware of all of these concerns could because if the web goes a lot of the things that make the internet good go away With it.

787
00:51:17,121 --> 00:51:18,185
Rym: Hmm.

788
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:28,675
Scott: Also, I've said this many times but you know as for the perspective of the app developers Right whenever you make a product if your product depends on someone else's product.

789
00:51:28,695 --> 00:51:36,475
Rym: Yeah, especially someone else's Barely documented API that has an updated in ten years then your business is at their whim.

790
00:51:36,536 --> 00:51:37,558
Scott: they couldn't buy you.

791
00:51:37,759 --> 00:51:46,519
Scott: they can duplicate the functionality that you have made and put you out of business or They can you know, so it's like you're just totally at their whim.

792
00:51:47,022 --> 00:51:49,513
Scott: Make sure you know what you're getting into if you're entering that kind of business.

793
00:51:49,554 --> 00:51:52,730
Scott: if your business is a Twitter client That is not official right?

794
00:51:52,771 --> 00:51:54,400
Scott: It's like well tweet deck got bought by Twitter.

795
00:51:54,764 --> 00:51:56,160
Rym: But in fact, here's an even better example.

796
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,172
Scott: But tweet bod did not just be shut down by Twitter at any moment.

797
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:00,613
Scott: the

798
00:52:00,713 --> 00:52:23,860
Rym: true vision of the world wide web on the internet Like the true idea for what a web browser was supposed to be Was basically that web browsers are both web clients and web servers and the idea was that everyone is both Connecting to other people to consume their content and Being themselves a source of content to which someone could link and from which someone could consume.

799
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:28,060
Scott: Yeah, like every web page was basically gonna be like Wikipedia like you could edit it right in the page.

800
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,008
Scott: Yeah, all the pages.

801
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:30,320
Scott: so that didn't happen.

802
00:52:30,460 --> 00:53:04,479
Rym: So imagine so let's use twitch as an analogy if twitch were or something if twitch streamers Acted the way the web was intended to work Then basically I'd run some software like OBS made by some neckbeards somewhere and an open-source community to this thriving and I Publish my content in a distributed fashion Directly to the people who consume it over the internet without any intermediaries or third parties and As a result I can control the experience and if I want to charge money for that or run ads It's a contract between me and my own clients.

803
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:09,254
Rym: But instead twitch streamers exists solely at the whim of twitch and YouTube.

804
00:53:09,855 --> 00:53:14,950
Rym: they can't directly publish And they can't even even if they use like patreon.

805
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:17,840
Rym: to get around this they still have to publish through these platforms.

806
00:53:18,122 --> 00:53:26,942
Rym: there isn't a good federated model for publishing and most of the large companies on the internet and the infrastructure as they vested interest in making sure there is no good way to Do this.

807
00:53:27,063 --> 00:53:32,088
Scott: and even if you you know if you make a saw an OBS is open source Thankfully right and there's other places to stream to.

808
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:37,237
Scott: but like if you make X split and twitch decides We're gonna make it to X split doesn't work with twitch.

809
00:53:37,278 --> 00:53:37,500
Scott: Guess what?

810
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,224
Scott: We're just gonna.

811
00:53:39,244 --> 00:53:40,568
Rym: we won't support our TMP.

812
00:53:40,629 --> 00:53:42,514
Scott: They won't do that, but they could yeah.

813
00:53:42,795 --> 00:53:46,119
Rym: Well, they won't do that soon They won't do it now.

814
00:53:46,482 --> 00:53:47,447
Scott: We made an app that you have.

815
00:53:47,467 --> 00:53:49,580
Scott: you want to see the twitch you got to use the twitch streamer app.

816
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:50,567
Scott: No, there's nothing else will work.

817
00:53:50,588 --> 00:53:51,212
Scott: We blocked them all.

818
00:53:51,374 --> 00:53:52,099
Scott: Yeah, it could happen.

819
00:53:58,032 --> 00:54:00,570
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
