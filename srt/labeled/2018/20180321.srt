00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,254
Rym: It's Wednesday March 21st 2018.

2
00:00:10,254 --> 00:00:11,658
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:14,465
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,505 --> 00:00:16,610
Rym: We review Lou over the wall.

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,466
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:20,314
Rym: Got to do something.

7
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,563
Rym: I only get to do two or three times a year today.

8
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:24,150
Rym: I wore the work in the snow.

9
00:00:24,471 --> 00:00:28,390
Rym: Yeah, so many people didn't go to work and it was totally fine.

10
00:00:28,932 --> 00:00:32,950
Rym: But I realized all the people who didn't go to work are the people who don't live in the city.

11
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:37,449
Rym: Basically if you work in the city, but don't live in the city, it sucks and that's it.

12
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,370
Rym: So everyone who lives in the city was just in the office and everyone doesn't live in the city.

13
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:43,999
Rym: He was working from home pretty much.

14
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:45,849
Rym: I got to wear my fancy boots.

15
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,974
Scott: Okay, I mean you could wear them whenever you want.

16
00:00:48,994 --> 00:00:50,277
Scott: You don't have to wear them when it's news.

17
00:00:50,337 --> 00:00:52,873
Rym: They're so big and There's.

18
00:00:52,934 --> 00:00:59,389
Rym: they're the most comfortable shoes I own but they're so big and clunky that it's there's very few occasions to ever wear them.

19
00:00:59,952 --> 00:01:03,790
Scott: My pre my boots that I were very expensive and high quality.

20
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:08,830
Scott: The rubber part just like had cracks in it recently, so I had to get new one.

21
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,743
Scott: Oh, yeah, and then I realized wait, these are so old.

22
00:01:11,803 --> 00:01:13,130
Scott: I had them when I lived in Beacon.

23
00:01:13,534 --> 00:01:24,309
Scott: You can't be too salty about that No, but I bought new ones and the new ones I got I guess were highest rated on Zappos or whatever And they're the kind where there's no laces or anything.

24
00:01:24,953 --> 00:01:28,130
Scott: So at first I ordered the regular size, but they were all slippy.

25
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:30,249
Scott: So the size smaller and that was better.

26
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:39,439
Scott: But the inside of them is all like fuzzy and cozy like a slipper you would wear in your house But you would never know when by looking at him.

27
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:44,659
Scott: Oh, so it's like I'm walking around and my feet are like But everyone you looking at me.

28
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:46,589
Scott: It looks like I'm wearing a clunky boot.

29
00:01:46,991 --> 00:01:54,186
Rym: I have like a leather boot in insert that is itself as big as an entire boot and I can wear that like a giant comfortable slipper.

30
00:01:55,052 --> 00:01:57,080
Rym: And then inside of the boot is that.

31
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,747
Rym: but then the boot itself is like this monster.

32
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:01,943
Scott: Mm-hmm Well, they seem very good to keep my feet warm and dry.

33
00:02:01,983 --> 00:02:03,270
Scott: So yeah, no complaint.

34
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:11,298
Rym: Yeah, the snow is not really a big problem and everyone's kind of freaking out about it, but we don't drive Yeah, we don't go far to work.

35
00:02:11,338 --> 00:02:12,062
Rym: Don't have to shovel.

36
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:17,869
Scott: No, cuz it seems like Just it is Cold, which is fucking bullshit.

37
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:21,689
Rym: It'll be warm soon enough, but I might ski this weekend with all this snow.

38
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:24,423
Scott: I mean this climate change really some false advertising.

39
00:02:24,564 --> 00:02:25,448
Scott: It's supposed to be 90 degrees.

40
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:31,330
Scott: I burned coal to make it 90 degrees in March and it has not yet to be 90 degrees in March.

41
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:32,055
Scott: I'm very upset.

42
00:02:32,075 --> 00:02:34,088
Rym: I gotta see how much snow we're getting.

43
00:02:34,108 --> 00:02:34,470
Rym: upstate Cuz.

44
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:37,222
Rym: actually I think the snow is coming here more than it is up there.

45
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:41,293
Scott: So just burn more coal this year Rolling your coal.

46
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:42,396
Scott: That's right.

47
00:02:42,456 --> 00:02:43,599
Scott: I gotta get it to be warm.

48
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,121
Scott: It's too cold.

49
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:47,190
Rym: So you got any anime or animation related news?

50
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,877
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I guess it's not super news.

51
00:02:49,897 --> 00:02:50,680
Scott: This is movie.

52
00:02:51,142 --> 00:02:52,970
Scott: they came out and anime movie.

53
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:58,850
Scott: They came out like late 2016 and I guess there at least I didn't notice any talking about it.

54
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,134
Scott: But that could just be like it.

55
00:03:00,154 --> 00:03:00,636
Scott: just be me.

56
00:03:00,656 --> 00:03:02,824
Scott: I think I saw this mention.

57
00:03:02,864 --> 00:03:04,470
Scott: I heard it mentioned like one time.

58
00:03:04,891 --> 00:03:13,910
Scott: So this is a movie that's in the sad Hiroshima genre, which is it's a genre a common genre Japanese works of all mediums obviously.

59
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:21,604
Scott: But yeah, it's called in this corner of the world and the news is that this shit is on Netflix and people didn't even fucking know about that.

60
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,470
Scott: So I plan to go home and watch this on Netflix as soon as I get a chance.

61
00:03:25,651 --> 00:03:27,398
Rym: All right, I guess this will be our next Wednesday show.

62
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:30,210
Rym: maybe the GeekNights movie club watch this movie.

63
00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:31,556
Rym: We're gonna review it soon.

64
00:03:32,118 --> 00:03:41,168
Scott: But yeah, uh, it's like wow, there's an anime movie That's totally legit that you know showed up on Netflix and I the only reason I know is one person tweeted it.

65
00:03:41,369 --> 00:03:43,099
Scott: one person No one else said a damn thing.

66
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,498
Scott: Yeah, if it wasn't for that one person I wouldn't even know and it wasn't for me.

67
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:48,205
Scott: You wouldn't even know so speak.

68
00:03:48,225 --> 00:03:49,290
Scott: How did that go under the radar?

69
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,039
Scott: I don't I don't know.

70
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,244
Rym: I I Vaguely was aware of this.

71
00:03:53,264 --> 00:04:03,370
Scott: in the same way There's not many anime movies that figure if any one of them is even screened Anywhere outside of Japan that there'll be like a big explosive, you know news at least in the nerd.

72
00:04:03,621 --> 00:04:11,803
Rym: Yeah or in the very least we'll like find out just the way we do and get tickets and go see it because I usually be In New York, I guess we missed this until now, but we're good.

73
00:04:12,225 --> 00:04:29,690
Rym: But speaking of a tweet If you don't follow Anna Twitter like Mike tool at all Darryl sir, like all those types of people Mike reminded me today of saw of a chapter of my life That was very important to me and people who were fans not just of anime but of East Asian cinema.

74
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,098
Scott: Well any cinema that wasn't United States in.

75
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,105
Rym: so you young kids might not understand.

76
00:04:34,185 --> 00:04:38,780
Rym: but when we went to college It was rare to have a DVD player.

77
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:43,078
Scott: They were when we got to college freshman year No one none of us owned one.

78
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:44,003
Scott: There was a cherry.

79
00:04:44,023 --> 00:04:45,110
Scott: we had VHS players.

80
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:47,382
Scott: It was a DVDs or super news.

81
00:04:47,402 --> 00:04:48,065
Scott: the year 2000, you know.

82
00:04:48,146 --> 00:04:51,421
Scott: DVDs I think came out in the late 90s, but people still.

83
00:04:51,482 --> 00:04:53,310
Scott: they were not widely adopted in 2000.

84
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,501
Scott: They became widely adopted between 2000 2003 for yeah.

85
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:07,102
Scott: And when we got to RIT the ps2 was brand new freshman year the year 2000 and it had a D. It was a DVD was a DVD player, which was you know.

86
00:05:07,142 --> 00:05:08,788
Scott: nowadays it's like oh, it's a bure pair.

87
00:05:08,828 --> 00:05:09,470
Scott: who cares, right?

88
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,197
Scott: But it's like at that time it was like whoa.

89
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:14,309
Scott: I need a DVD player anyway and a ps2.

90
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,373
Scott: It's the same deal.

91
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:16,518
Scott: It's like a huge deal.

92
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:17,562
Scott: It's like it was a bargain.

93
00:05:17,622 --> 00:05:18,686
Scott: cuz you're getting more important.

94
00:05:18,707 --> 00:05:19,409
Scott: You're getting twofer.

95
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:34,553
Rym: DVD was like doubly important in that era because an anime VHS box set Tended to cost two to four times more than the exact same show in a DVD box set and DVDs on anime were starting to Come out that year 2000.

96
00:05:34,553 --> 00:05:37,684
Scott: That's when they first started making them for reals.

97
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:39,490
Rym: So we didn't have any money.

98
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:45,109
Scott: There was a charity casino night that we went and gambled fake money to attempt to win a ps2.

99
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:48,330
Scott: We want all air between us and we failed.

100
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:53,590
Rym: I wonder what would happen across all our different dorm rooms if that would have been a radioactive man number one situation.

101
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,429
Scott: Well, the other people we know bought a ps2 at some point.

102
00:05:56,811 --> 00:05:57,574
Scott: Yeah, he didn't.

103
00:05:58,016 --> 00:06:01,330
Scott: so what we did and our TV was much larger and superior.

104
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:05,209
Rym: But what we did is the summer between our freshman and sophomore year.

105
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:09,850
Rym: Was this golden age where DVD players are actually really expensive?

106
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:15,329
Scott: yeah, they were like three four hundred dollars, but there was a particular brand of.

107
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,643
Rym: I don't want to say they were bootleg, but they were dodgy as fuck.

108
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:22,730
Scott: This was the year 2001 2002.

109
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,179
Scott: Yeah, not 2000.

110
00:06:24,179 --> 00:06:25,930
Rym: this company called apex.

111
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:30,630
Scott: You could buy these apex branded DVD play was sort of like Vizio TVs used to be where it's like.

112
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,740
Scott: What the hell is that brand?

113
00:06:31,781 --> 00:06:34,398
Scott: I never seen the TV like Magnet box.

114
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,214
Scott: Yeah, it wasn't that it wasn't like that But it was like this brand.

115
00:06:37,234 --> 00:06:41,110
Scott: you never heard of suddenly producing electronics and selling him at the store.

116
00:06:41,351 --> 00:06:48,022
Rym: So we learned from the early internet while we were at RIT That the apexes were special for two reasons.

117
00:06:48,223 --> 00:06:53,700
Rym: one if you bought one It costs like hundred bucks 60 bucks.

118
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,723
Scott: Sometimes they were.

119
00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:56,890
Scott: they were el cheapo crapo DVD players.

120
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,276
Scott: We're up until that point.

121
00:06:58,337 --> 00:07:00,607
Rym: I think I would circuit city to get one.

122
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:04,323
Scott: up until that point I had borrowed stolen a DVD player from someone else.

123
00:07:04,363 --> 00:07:05,950
Scott: That was actually a Sony legit one.

124
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:08,142
Rym: Yeah, that DVD player was a part of.

125
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:08,545
Scott: that was my.

126
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:09,490
Scott: that was my best DVD.

127
00:07:10,172 --> 00:07:14,167
Rym: Well, we know for a fact that Scott's owned that DVD players.

128
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:14,970
Scott: That is correct.

129
00:07:15,191 --> 00:07:17,206
Scott: DVD player belong to Scott.

130
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,247
Rym: Whatever anyone on the show even knows that.

131
00:07:20,347 --> 00:07:20,630
Rym: anyway.

132
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:21,775
Rym: That's that's somebody.

133
00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:25,450
Rym: if you were a fan of us in like 2005 you might know what we're referring to anyway.

134
00:07:26,032 --> 00:07:37,669
Rym: So I did research and learn that if you buy an apex, not only are they cheap Not only are they shitty But it worked if y'all bought the right one.

135
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:46,117
Rym: Meaning you had to look at the serial numbers look for particular Combinations of numbers and like you had to look at the box and like figure this out I was at a circuit city.

136
00:07:46,137 --> 00:07:48,330
Scott: Yeah, this was not buying on the internet days.

137
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,694
Scott: This was buying in a store.

138
00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:53,144
Rym: like I went to stores like bigger stores wouldn't carry.

139
00:07:53,284 --> 00:08:01,030
Scott: apex drove a car innocent In the suburbs of the college town to I heard to circuit city in the Best Buy to look at DVD player.

140
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,572
Rym: that's why I didn't even have these things.

141
00:08:02,632 --> 00:08:21,576
Rym: now I heard tell that a circuit city a couple towns over had a bunch of them and They were just in their original boxes on a pallet on the show floor Which is what I needed because I had to look at the serial numbers and the version numbers and the model numbers to get this Particular one that was either region free.

142
00:08:21,596 --> 00:08:28,609
Rym: We'll get back to what that means and why we cared or Was capable of being hacked to become region free.

143
00:08:29,651 --> 00:08:42,371
Rym: So the reason we cared was that if you there were a lot of anime DVDs But more importantly a lot of like weird East Asian cinema DVDs that were not region one Right.

144
00:08:42,392 --> 00:08:47,410
Scott: So even that expensive high-quality Sony player would not play some of it some of the easy one.

145
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,438
Scott: And now some DVDs were unlocked.

146
00:08:49,478 --> 00:08:56,506
Scott: like we'd go to video barn and they would have a bootleg DVD that would work No matter what but but even video barn would flag like some of the movies they had.

147
00:08:56,527 --> 00:08:57,330
Rym: they're like guys.

148
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,338
Rym: This is region to like.

149
00:08:58,358 --> 00:08:59,850
Rym: they put a warning on the box, right?

150
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:04,890
Scott: It's like you needed to have this hack DVD player to watch any DVD in the world because they were all region locked.

151
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:21,445
Rym: So I it's funny because my tool tweeted about this I think ever almost everyone from this particular era of anime fandom or East Asian cinema fandom in the u.s Did the same thing about the same shitty apex DVD player because it was region free.

152
00:09:21,465 --> 00:09:28,290
Rym: and then in retrospect We probably only watched like four things that needed the region freeness at any point.

153
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:32,145
Scott: Yeah, also that DVD player is so crappy had problems like overheating and such.

154
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:33,290
Scott: so we would like take the lid off.

155
00:09:33,418 --> 00:09:35,269
Rym: Yeah I Burned this DV.

156
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:42,714
Rym: Well, I burned a CD and I put it in there and I did some stuff to it that hacked the firmware to make it Truly region free.

157
00:09:42,774 --> 00:09:46,990
Scott: eventually we graduated to HD PC and we were still watching DVDs.

158
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,656
Scott: What you do is the HD PC.

159
00:09:48,676 --> 00:09:50,462
Scott: you'd have a piece of software called any DVD.

160
00:09:50,482 --> 00:09:53,652
Scott: Yeah, that would unlock your CD ROM some CD.

161
00:09:53,833 --> 00:10:01,545
Rym: so some DVDs would just play on Computers without much effort and some you had to mess with you make it work.

162
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,610
Rym: I That's this whole era flooded back to me.

163
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:14,407
Rym: So if you wonder why Anna Twitter is talking about a particular shitty DVD player from the early 2000s, that is why mm-hmm in some other really tiny news.

164
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:22,207
Rym: Adventure time which I feel like we're gonna have to do a big like even a bus short series on adventure time.

165
00:10:22,307 --> 00:10:24,174
Rym: once it's done done Do something it's good.

166
00:10:24,255 --> 00:10:24,797
Rym: It's ending.

167
00:10:24,817 --> 00:10:27,487
Scott: It is end and ending the end of all of them.

168
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:28,270
Scott: There are comics.

169
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,622
Scott: I don't know if the comics will end but TV show will end.

170
00:10:31,702 --> 00:10:32,766
Rym: the TV show not.

171
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:33,348
Scott: they might make.

172
00:10:33,388 --> 00:10:34,794
Scott: who knows if they'll make Anything else?

173
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,101
Scott: I don't know they could be moving.

174
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:37,146
Scott: who knows what they're gonna do, right?

175
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:37,850
Scott: It's completely unknown.

176
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:46,680
Scott: But the actual adventure time TV show the original core real deal is going to have a final episode Five episodes from now.

177
00:10:46,821 --> 00:10:52,249
Rym: there is a teaser trailer up now Hinting at the what the end arc will be.

178
00:10:52,872 --> 00:10:54,438
Scott: I don't know like do they mean five?

179
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:57,690
Scott: because adventure time is a weird show where one episode is like two tiny ones.

180
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,810
Scott: But usually it's like there'd be a tiny new one and then a tiny old one next to each other.

181
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:11,824
Scott: So is it gonna be ten tiny episodes or five half-hours like I have no Five 15 minute episodes like how long is that these five episodes gonna be?

182
00:11:12,145 --> 00:11:13,950
Rym: there's so the thing adventure time.

183
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:24,830
Rym: like I really like Steven Universe, and I like a lot of shows, but I think adventure time is going to Survive and be remembered as one of the most important and influential cartoons in American animation history.

184
00:11:25,191 --> 00:11:30,390
Rym: Mmm, like it's it's had a long enough run and these she's all started with that crap.

185
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,701
Rym: Oh, yeah, that's short that we watched at RIT.

186
00:11:33,881 --> 00:11:39,344
Rym: Who knows when we watched that we watched that at RIT I remember very specifically because we were for like a week.

187
00:11:39,384 --> 00:11:46,510
Rym: We were like algebraic And then we just forgot about it and then later someone was like hey, you know They turned it into a garden network TV show.

188
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:52,030
Scott: It's real like I didn't realize it like when adventure time had become a TV show Like I was like, I feel like I've seen these characters before.

189
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:57,390
Scott: Yeah, I was like I didn't quite put it together that oh that weird little one-off short somehow became a legit.

190
00:11:57,671 --> 00:12:01,990
Rym: I didn't even start watching it until several seasons in and I didn't watch it several seasons in either.

191
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:07,723
Scott: But then I watched every episode up to a point Sometime, I don't remember maybe a couple years ago.

192
00:12:07,743 --> 00:12:09,690
Scott: Yeah, and I was like, alright, it's gonna end.

193
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,784
Scott: Do you say well, I will just stop watching now and when it ends then I will go.

194
00:12:13,804 --> 00:12:16,213
Rym: whoosh you're there's a lot That's happened.

195
00:12:16,373 --> 00:12:17,699
Scott: I'm sure a lot has happened.

196
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,490
Scott: But if I think about adventure time, it's real quick to watch.

197
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,289
Scott: You can just burn through so fast.

198
00:12:22,831 --> 00:12:36,832
Rym: but the the most impressive thing about it and the reason why I put it on such a high pedestal is that the sheer scope of Eames the end styles that it is embraced over its run is Shocking.

199
00:12:37,394 --> 00:12:41,105
Rym: they're like pick any like for random seasons and watch one random episode.

200
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:48,470
Rym: They're so different You might not even realize they're the same show and yet they are all thematically tied.

201
00:12:48,771 --> 00:12:51,540
Rym: Despite this the scope is breathtaking.

202
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:57,450
Rym: The fact that it's ending is actually a pretty big deal Mm-hmm, and then Scott will finally watch a bunch of this.

203
00:12:57,731 --> 00:13:00,650
Rym: I don't even know how they're gonna resolve all the Jake stuff that they mean.

204
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,930
Scott: I you know, it's gonna be one of those things and they don't resolve everything which is dope.

205
00:13:04,231 --> 00:13:05,456
Rym: Well what I want what I wonder?

206
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:13,830
Rym: I don't care if they resolve any details of the story because it's kind of like Evangelion and end of Evangelion if you cared about those details you miss the point.

207
00:13:14,392 --> 00:13:15,035
Rym: It's the same thing.

208
00:13:15,076 --> 00:13:18,010
Rym: what I'm wondering about is how are they going to resolve this?

209
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:23,979
Rym: cyclical almost hero of time Story around Finn on the meta level.

210
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:24,541
Rym: Mm-hmm.

211
00:13:24,702 --> 00:13:25,144
Rym: There's the.

212
00:13:25,445 --> 00:13:26,650
Rym: the themes are what I want to see.

213
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,795
Scott: We don't have to resolve it.

214
00:13:28,097 --> 00:13:34,610
Rym: You just had to you know, well, I'll put it this way Where are they going to leave the overarching theme of the show?

215
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,534
Rym: Irrespective of the details?

216
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,843
Rym: because they've hinted at a lot of very interesting directions.

217
00:13:40,264 --> 00:13:46,921
Scott: There's not much time left to Solidify that you can only do so much in five episodes.

218
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:48,948
Scott: However big those five episodes are.

219
00:13:48,968 --> 00:13:50,995
Rym: Yep They could have just kept going forever.

220
00:13:51,055 --> 00:13:54,566
Rym: Finn's been aging at a rate of one year per actual year.

221
00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:59,790
Rym: The show has been produced Like he had his birthday in the show and it lines up like recently.

222
00:14:00,532 --> 00:14:02,800
Rym: so I was kind of hoping they would keep going.

223
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:19,763
Rym: and when I'm in my 80s like Finn the human is like 70 something and he's just like the show is being animated by 20 year olds for your 80.

224
00:14:19,763 --> 00:14:22,640
Rym: But anyway things of the day what do you got?

225
00:14:23,721 --> 00:14:28,613
Scott: So this is a really kind of simple deal here, but it's a whole lot of fun.

226
00:14:28,713 --> 00:14:29,716
Scott: Even though it's so simple.

227
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:33,283
Scott: It's a website and This website.

228
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:42,576
Scott: all you do is put in a URL of an image or upload an image or upload an image and It will take that image and put it on a flag on a flagpole and wave the fuck out of it.

229
00:14:42,596 --> 00:14:43,057
Scott: in 3d the edge.

230
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:54,287
Scott: Oh, you can choose between Dexter and sinister hoisting yeah, and you can change the flag to be vertical horizontal left right up or down and you can turn the wind on and Off and that's about it.

231
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:57,399
Scott: And you should definitely put a good goatsey flag up there first.

232
00:14:58,423 --> 00:14:59,468
Rym: You were trying to do.

233
00:14:59,488 --> 00:15:01,659
Scott: how can you resist that as your first option?

234
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:08,320
Rym: I Feel like goatsey is fading from the public like internet culture and consciousness.

235
00:15:08,428 --> 00:15:09,764
Rym: Yeah probably for the best.

236
00:15:09,884 --> 00:15:20,120
Scott: but the point is if you need to say for example make like a YouTube video or a movie or Some kind of short and in that you want to have a scene of a flag wave I guess I don't know what kind of rights are tied to this.

237
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:20,947
Rym: I guess I don't have any right.

238
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:26,740
Scott: pretty sure you could just screen capture The box of the flag waving and scale it up to 1080p and you're good to go.

239
00:15:27,405 --> 00:15:28,513
Rym: Whatever will happen if I zoom it out.

240
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:31,122
Rym: Look if I zoom in It doesn't.

241
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,709
Rym: it zooms the web page, but not the flag.

242
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,193
Scott: Yeah, that's fine.

243
00:15:35,754 --> 00:15:37,860
Scott: The point is this is pretty cool and fun.

244
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:42,234
Scott: Yeah is a nice amusement for a short time and also possibly a useful tool.

245
00:15:42,656 --> 00:15:50,916
Rym: So speaking animation you might remember I'm pretty sure we made this thing today a long time ago But IBM made a movie an animation like an actual animated cartoon a short.

246
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,000
Scott: IBM made a lot of stuff.

247
00:15:52,041 --> 00:16:03,728
Rym: There's the Jim Henson IBM Movies and shit, but this was the one that was literally constructed of individual Adams Titled a boy and his Adam.

248
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,658
Rym: Yeah, we talked about it a long time ago.

249
00:16:05,678 --> 00:16:07,085
Rym: I'm confident We did so.

250
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,840
Rym: my thing of the day is not the animation because that's old old news.

251
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:19,786
Rym: my thing of the day is that I found all these videos that explain in detail how the hell they made an animation with Individual visible Adams.

252
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:23,020
Scott: Well recently there was that photo of a single Adam, right?

253
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,295
Scott: somebody won like the the science photo of the Year award with.

254
00:16:27,657 --> 00:16:30,050
Rym: so this is Utterly fascinating.

255
00:16:30,171 --> 00:16:31,400
Rym: and these videos are all short.

256
00:16:31,461 --> 00:16:32,580
Rym: They're like two minutes.

257
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,306
Rym: even if you have no attention span.

258
00:16:34,788 --> 00:16:44,937
Rym: you can watch this video and learn a weird story about how IBM made a machine to literally move an individual Adam around so that they could create a stop-motion animation.

259
00:16:45,218 --> 00:16:47,593
Scott: Adams are pretty small So they're good for short attention.

260
00:16:47,896 --> 00:16:51,147
Scott: Yeah You can see a lot of them all at once real easily.

261
00:16:51,588 --> 00:16:55,800
Rym: in the moment the book club book is the Odyssey by Homer.

262
00:16:56,323 --> 00:16:59,400
Scott: So I I loaded that shit up on the kindle on my iPhone.

263
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,645
Rym: I start reading it now.

264
00:17:00,665 --> 00:17:03,175
Scott: basically the Kindle says I'll finish reading in like 12 13 hours.

265
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,740
Scott: So add up poops and train rides and of 13 hours and that's what I'm gonna finish.

266
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:13,834
Rym: I think we'll do the gig the GeekNights book club on Emily Wilson's translation of the Odyssey.

267
00:17:14,675 --> 00:17:20,032
Rym: a week or two after packs 12 or 13 poop train hours from now you burn through it pretty quick.

268
00:17:20,093 --> 00:17:20,876
Rym: Once you start reading.

269
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,220
Rym: Did you start reading?

270
00:17:23,281 --> 00:17:29,450
Scott: I'm rereading intro because I you know, just yeah Because I read the intro and then I forgot half the intro.

271
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:33,683
Rym: The intro is actually really good like really interesting I learned.

272
00:17:33,743 --> 00:17:36,779
Scott: I'm obviously going through the intro pretty quick because it's the second reading of the.

273
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,084
Rym: yeah It's kind of.

274
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:40,251
Rym: it's quite good to reread it if you were fuzzy on the details.

275
00:17:40,271 --> 00:17:47,226
Rym: cuz reading the actual Odyssey and keeping that in Mind is really important But it's it's good.

276
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,340
Rym: Otherwise, uh, if you want to go to our website right now.

277
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,750
Rym: You can see gig guides judge anime by its cover.

278
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,060
Rym: We did review the entire winter season of anime.

279
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:56,898
Rym: That's on now before it came out.

280
00:17:57,081 --> 00:18:07,519
Scott: Yeah and according to the anime chart the next season of anime is starting in like 15 to 2012 between 12 and 20 days from now, so we're going to review that season very soon.

281
00:18:07,722 --> 00:18:10,316
Scott: Yes, very soon like maybe you know Let's see a week or two.

282
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:26,959
Rym: But what I need you to do if you're watching this season's anime is go watch our review of this season That we made before we watched any of this anime and leave a comment to tell us if we were right or wrong about any Particular show because if you never tell us we're wrong, we're just gonna assume we're right.

283
00:18:28,263 --> 00:18:30,604
Rym: If you want to see us live well Guess what.

284
00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:42,629
Rym: PAX East is way sooner than you realize Ridiculous soon and we're gonna be there Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday and on Sunday at 10 30 a.m The third worst possible panel slot.

285
00:18:42,911 --> 00:18:45,360
Rym: we are doing the top 40 tabletop games.

286
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,240
Rym: You must play if you want to see that panel live.

287
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:53,200
Rym: There will be some content for you that will not make it to YouTube, but we're gonna try to do the thing on YouTube.

288
00:18:53,642 --> 00:18:58,020
Rym: So if you show up to this panel think of yourselves as the live studio audience.

289
00:18:58,261 --> 00:19:01,553
Scott: I mean normally I tell people it's PAX you get something better to do.

290
00:19:01,593 --> 00:19:03,340
Rym: don't come and see anything better to do.

291
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,767
Rym: It's Sunday morning.

292
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:07,360
Scott: Yeah, it's Sunday morning is actually like the time.

293
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:16,088
Scott: Maybe you could consider coming and frankly maybe if you want to know something better to do But not much not as much as other times of that.

294
00:19:16,108 --> 00:19:18,415
Rym: also unlike other PAX is I like?

295
00:19:18,435 --> 00:19:19,860
Rym: I've realized something with our fans.

296
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,347
Rym: It's real easy for people to find us at all.

297
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:33,700
Rym: The PAX is except East East is so big and so dense that There are friends we know who go to PAX East who we never bump into in tabletop at any point.

298
00:19:34,463 --> 00:19:36,792
Rym: So if you're trying to find us there you're basically effed.

299
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:42,419
Rym: so this is the only Guaranteed way to find us at PAX East.

300
00:19:44,441 --> 00:19:52,447
Rym: So, yeah, we went to see at the New York International Children's Film Festival as we do anime movies And one of the movies we saw is loo over the wall.

301
00:19:52,528 --> 00:19:56,200
Scott: This is the like opening of the festival movie, right?

302
00:19:57,002 --> 00:19:58,349
Scott: It was dubbed which I was surprised.

303
00:19:58,409 --> 00:19:59,817
Rym: I didn't know that was good though.

304
00:19:59,978 --> 00:20:00,420
Rym: That's fine.

305
00:20:00,561 --> 00:20:01,426
Rym: Yeah, we'll talk about that.

306
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:03,940
Scott: some of the characters sounded like my little pony characters.

307
00:20:04,281 --> 00:20:11,600
Rym: Yeah, I did not look at who the voice actors were to confirm that but I was so sure that girl was Pinkie Pie pretty quick, maybe.

308
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:18,100
Scott: So yeah, so this is also made by Masaaki wasa who we talked about recently who did an Adventure Time short.

309
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,367
Scott: Yeah, we talked very easily for Devilman crybaby.

310
00:20:20,408 --> 00:20:22,234
Scott: So it's like, you know this dude.

311
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,020
Scott: It's like wow, he's making tons of crap.

312
00:20:24,783 --> 00:20:25,968
Scott: Yep, it's all over the place.

313
00:20:26,249 --> 00:20:34,558
Rym: if I had to on a really high level I try to pin down what I would think of when I think of Masaaki Yuasa Things that are a little bit weird.

314
00:20:35,504 --> 00:20:36,639
Rym: Yeah, isn't what I would say.

315
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:41,520
Scott: But what I noticed is he has this distinctive art, you know artistic style as most you know.

316
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:49,008
Scott: You don't tell just looking at it like it'll go a little flat a little like stretchy Usually usually what the way you can tell it's his.

317
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:56,943
Scott: the lines of the characters get a little bit wobbly Right almost like they're made with like a wiggly pencil Sort of.

318
00:20:57,425 --> 00:21:09,100
Scott: and like they're like they'll deform a little bit in sort of a Picasso Esque like you take an anime character and then like you don't go full Picasso But you like slightly Picasso it with wiggly outlines.

319
00:21:09,241 --> 00:21:13,100
Scott: Yeah, and that's what the Yuasa style looks like and you can see it in all his animes.

320
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:17,060
Scott: But what's interesting in Lu over the wall is most of the time?

321
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:24,800
Scott: The characters are like not drawn in that style or only have very tiny hints of his style showing through like a character.

322
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,920
Scott: We'll have like, you know a slightly elongated neck and you'll notice you know.

323
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:35,780
Scott: But then in scenes where appropriate where shit gonna you know goes crazy and magical and crazy things happen.

324
00:21:36,303 --> 00:21:39,080
Scott: Then everything like goes like super Yuasa land.

325
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,420
Rym: Yeah, and it happens like that like a song starts and it's crazy crazy crazy in your face, right?

326
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:46,748
Scott: That's the visual things about this.

327
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:50,040
Scott: also it's a it's anime movie with a big budget so it looks great in general.

328
00:21:50,722 --> 00:22:03,430
Rym: The only thing I'll say though if you if you think because you like Lu over the wall that you should immediately watch other things He's made like Devilman crybaby Just look at what those things are Before you watch them.

329
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,919
Rym: Yeah, that's what I'm going to say.

330
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:09,739
Scott: Anyway, so the second thing is I didn't know you might not know this is a musical, right?

331
00:22:10,442 --> 00:22:16,144
Scott: Since it was dubbed we had all replacement music and the replacement music was It was fine.

332
00:22:16,164 --> 00:22:16,686
Scott: It was okay.

333
00:22:16,706 --> 00:22:18,312
Scott: Yeah, but I won.

334
00:22:18,353 --> 00:22:20,220
Scott: I'm curious what the original music was.

335
00:22:20,563 --> 00:22:22,340
Rym: I'll find some clips to watch in Japanese.

336
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:29,220
Scott: Yeah I wonder I don't know if it was a Situation where the music was the same and they re-sang it or if it was completely new music or not.

337
00:22:29,341 --> 00:22:29,583
Scott: I don't.

338
00:22:29,705 --> 00:22:30,089
Scott: I don't know.

339
00:22:30,493 --> 00:22:34,511
Rym: I believe Someone in my Twitter feed said it's the same song.

340
00:22:34,551 --> 00:22:36,680
Rym: They just translated and re-sang and they I believe it.

341
00:22:37,991 --> 00:22:44,160
Rym: But the vague story of this we won't spoil anything because it's an anime movie and it's good and it's big-budget.

342
00:22:44,282 --> 00:22:45,298
Rym: You should just go see it.

343
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,276
Rym: Yeah, like if you need the short review just go see it like find a pirate.

344
00:22:49,296 --> 00:22:50,823
Rym: if you have to see this movie It's good.

345
00:22:50,843 --> 00:22:51,526
Rym: You'll enjoy it.

346
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:54,100
Scott: You'll probably marry in the witch's flower.

347
00:22:54,746 --> 00:22:55,756
Rym: Yeah, this is like.

348
00:22:56,763 --> 00:22:59,197
Rym: This is better than sort of a stranger.

349
00:22:59,217 --> 00:23:05,138
Rym: Yeah It is better than many many most of the anime movies we've reviewed.

350
00:23:05,198 --> 00:23:05,760
Rym: It's really good.

351
00:23:05,821 --> 00:23:06,447
Rym: It's got flaws.

352
00:23:06,487 --> 00:23:07,073
Rym: It's not perfect.

353
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:10,099
Scott: No, but If I it's not like a paprika.

354
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:21,779
Rym: But if I had to say like what I like about it the most on an abstract level without getting into details or spoiling anything It moves way faster than you expect it to.

355
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:28,940
Scott: well I think all Yuasa's work sort of this sort of breakneck pace where things keep moving along crazy fast and seemed disjointed.

356
00:23:29,482 --> 00:23:35,809
Scott: But you can still put them together in your brain like like it'll cut to a C me Things will start happening.

357
00:23:35,829 --> 00:23:36,373
Scott: You're like what.

358
00:23:36,413 --> 00:23:37,359
Scott: did we just skip all that?

359
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,051
Scott: Like I don't understand.

360
00:23:39,071 --> 00:23:44,960
Scott: and then 10 seconds later You just sort of accept it and go along with it and put it together in some way in your brain.

361
00:23:45,021 --> 00:23:55,633
Rym: Yep But like if you want to say like you want a really simple sample of what that can look like watch the adventure time Episode that he did because it is literally like normal adventure time.

362
00:23:55,653 --> 00:23:57,197
Scott: He also did a space dandy hips.

363
00:23:57,658 --> 00:24:00,027
Rym: I think so I don't even I never finished that show.

364
00:24:00,047 --> 00:24:10,560
Rym: I should mmm, but the movie also Covers a lot more ground and a lot more themes than you would expect from the first four minutes of the movie.

365
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:19,602
Scott: Yeah, I think because of the speed of it that you they fit more into it Even though it's also felt like you'll get to a slightly long, but it didn't feel like it dragged Like.

366
00:24:19,642 --> 00:24:21,174
Scott: it just felt like he kept doing stuff.

367
00:24:21,415 --> 00:24:24,340
Rym: at no point Do you think oh I know where this is going because you're wrong.

368
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:27,380
Rym: No, I had no idea was good and to you'll get to a plan.

369
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,599
Scott: It would be happy ending because it's a kids movie, but that's about it.

370
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,980
Rym: But it also took a pretty dark swerve that could have continued swerving.

371
00:24:34,201 --> 00:24:48,820
Scott: Oh, yeah, but some of it is it's sort of like, you know It has one of those situations where there are things happening where if you really think about what's happening It's really dark, but it's presented in a way that makes it seem, you know bright for children, right?

372
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,232
Rym: Yep, which is part of the.

373
00:24:50,273 --> 00:25:07,280
Rym: well We'll talk a few spoilers toward the end of this because I have some specific thoughts, but I don't want to ruin Interesting aspects of the movie because the fact that you're gonna have a hard time Figuring out where this movie is going is a big part of how you both how you might enjoy it the first time you watch it.

374
00:25:08,042 --> 00:25:16,879
Rym: There's a lot of music in it and you'll get to a point where someone's dad shows up and you're wondering what that's gonna be Like and then the movie is just like 90 to return for a while.

375
00:25:18,941 --> 00:25:33,950
Rym: It's also subtle in that there's a lot of little things that happen on screen and A lot of little things that happen in the background that if you notice them are really fascinating But you'll probably miss a lot of them right they cram.

376
00:25:34,171 --> 00:25:36,420
Scott: it's weird for your move for an anime movie.

377
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:44,250
Scott: It feels like he put as many characters in as you'd have in like a TV series, but none of them feel like Flat or useless like I know.

378
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,400
Scott: but the screen time of some of them is short.

379
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,960
Scott: But you still get their idea and they complete their arc even though they're only in there a little bit.

380
00:25:52,603 --> 00:25:53,487
Scott: You can make a hole.

381
00:25:53,527 --> 00:25:56,240
Scott: you can make almost half a Simpsons with the amount of characters.

382
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:04,384
Rym: there's a million characters who all have a recognizable arc and all have a recognizable and Relatively complex character.

383
00:26:04,445 --> 00:26:06,610
Rym: for how many seconds of screen time they have.

384
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:09,997
Scott: Yeah, like the grandpa the old lady.

385
00:26:10,058 --> 00:26:13,612
Rym: Yeah There's every one of these characters.

386
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,460
Rym: Yeah, it's like a Simpsons carrot.

387
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:21,540
Rym: It's like moves the you get about the level of most his lack and season six seven of the Simpsons like he's there.

388
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,647
Rym: There's a character there.

389
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:24,800
Scott: There's a complete aside.

390
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,312
Scott: There's a. there's a mighty Moses like comic book coming.

391
00:26:28,392 --> 00:26:33,795
Rym: what I feel like I need to read that Go ahead and buy this is like was my favorite Simpsons character for like three seasons.

392
00:26:33,855 --> 00:26:36,607
Scott: Oh the comic book store again I'll be out in like a month or two.

393
00:26:36,707 --> 00:26:36,908
Scott: Now.

394
00:26:36,948 --> 00:26:38,575
Rym: You're thinking of a guy with two knives.

395
00:26:39,177 --> 00:26:55,827
Rym: Oh, yeah But the music that not only is this a musical but it is a story about Characters who make music and characters who are invested in music and the power of music The literal magical power of music.

396
00:26:55,887 --> 00:26:56,068
Scott: like.

397
00:26:56,108 --> 00:26:59,580
Scott: it's not one of those things where like, you know, they talk about the power of music.

398
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:04,836
Rym: It's like don't make don't don't ever sing songs by the water cuz the fucking mermaids will come.

399
00:27:04,876 --> 00:27:07,289
Rym: get you and it's true That is literally the plot.

400
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:21,153
Scott: the mermaids like hey I see you got an electric guitar there and then you play music for the mermaids and then they cast a spell and make everyone dance, yep, like Literally happens not some sort of you know, oh metaphorical thing.

401
00:27:21,193 --> 00:27:21,755
Scott: It's like no.

402
00:27:21,775 --> 00:27:25,703
Scott: Yep that straight up magic but The.

403
00:27:25,743 --> 00:27:33,904
Rym: so the movie on a face value tells a really good kids story like for this is a fantastic Movie for a kid to see.

404
00:27:33,924 --> 00:27:34,225
Rym: Mm-hmm.

405
00:27:34,626 --> 00:27:35,810
Scott: I mean it was at the children's film.

406
00:27:35,891 --> 00:27:51,402
Rym: Yeah, but it it is perfectly understandable within the bounds of Masaaki Hwasa and And straightforward on a direct face value reading because we talk about that a lot with you Tana and our antenna analysis show how you can something.

407
00:27:51,442 --> 00:28:04,060
Rym: the the mark of good allegory is when you have a show or a movie or a work that Works completely on a face value and works completely on its higher order metaphorical or allegorical level.

408
00:28:04,524 --> 00:28:14,260
Rym: this movie does that very well and The metaphors in the allegory that are addressed are actually pretty complex and some of them are pretty subtle.

409
00:28:14,804 --> 00:28:25,120
Rym: it is very easy to read the simple concept of mermaids as Presented in this movie as a direct metaphor for death and loss or for immigrants.

410
00:28:25,563 --> 00:28:32,590
Rym: Oh, yes, and both of those stories work entirely self consistently and do not conflict with each other.

411
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,295
Rym: or the face value story of.

412
00:28:34,596 --> 00:28:37,485
Rym: there are literal mermaids in this town where For literal specific reasons.

413
00:28:37,545 --> 00:28:45,240
Scott: Yeah, there's also, you know, this all the sub stories Right also have their own sort of like messages and arcs right all the way.

414
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,589
Scott: You know the smallest one being like.

415
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:50,360
Scott: there's a girl who does the PA system for the town.

416
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:56,699
Rym: Oh my god, the fact that she had her holes arc and story and the echoing came back at the end, right?

417
00:28:57,081 --> 00:29:11,186
Scott: It's like she's this character You never see except for like near the end when one of the main girl like visits her for like a minute And I but you get her whole deal and she helps in the end and does a thing and this person is maybe in the Movie for a total of like two minutes,

418
00:29:11,387 --> 00:29:12,189
Rym: but my man

419
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:17,139
Scott: her her story not only matters to the plot And she helps save the day or whatever.

420
00:29:17,641 --> 00:29:23,100
Scott: But you know, she has like this message about like what you should you do with your life and such in meaning and whatnot.

421
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,880
Scott: Like, you know just her thing, you know has another message to to give right?

422
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,220
Scott: It's not like this one big message of the movie with everything contributing.

423
00:29:31,661 --> 00:29:35,675
Scott: It's all these small separate messages that are all delivered separately.

424
00:29:35,695 --> 00:29:43,540
Rym: Yeah, but they all Sort of resonate together to form a wave of like this higher-order metaphor, right?

425
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:47,160
Scott: They all they all like peak in climax and resolve together, right?

426
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:59,220
Scott: the big and one of the bigger ones is like You know this battle in the town for like trying to get more tourism money because it's a it's a small town But nothing going on and all the kids want to leave because there's no future there.

427
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:06,339
Rym: But it also peaks with the literal battle of the the old lady and her allies with spares trying to kill mermaids.

428
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:18,186
Rym: Yep There's there's a lot going on and I was very impressed with the ability for all those stories and characters to work and not feel Disjointed or distracting or plotting.

429
00:30:18,206 --> 00:30:19,350
Rym: Mm-hmm.

430
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,315
Rym: I mean, I really like this movie.

431
00:30:21,335 --> 00:30:25,288
Scott: Yeah, so it's like character wise you've got like.

432
00:30:25,709 --> 00:30:26,893
Scott: the main character is just.

433
00:30:26,954 --> 00:30:29,664
Scott: you know, you seem sort of like a Cliche.

434
00:30:29,684 --> 00:30:30,674
Scott: you see an anime a lot.

435
00:30:30,714 --> 00:30:30,835
Scott: Yes.

436
00:30:30,876 --> 00:30:34,007
Rym: He's the Dude, who's boring?

437
00:30:34,067 --> 00:30:35,651
Scott: He's almost like Takumi.

438
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,416
Scott: He's really good at a thing.

439
00:30:37,596 --> 00:30:38,880
Rym: He's just Shinji Takumi.

440
00:30:39,141 --> 00:30:42,496
Rym: Yeah takes Shinji and Takumi mix him together talking me from initial D.

441
00:30:42,516 --> 00:30:52,577
Scott: If you don't know we're talking about Yeah, really bored really good at something but doesn't care also makes but then you know discovers mermaids and is like Oh now he's got a thing going on.

442
00:30:52,759 --> 00:31:04,940
Rym: Yep You know unleashes his driving power or his robot fighting power or whatever music making but he also makes all the same Very poor decisions for dubious reasons, but the reasons make sense in the context of he's a dumb kid, right?

443
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,092
Scott: But all the other characters are all crazy and fun, right?

444
00:31:08,112 --> 00:31:09,879
Scott: So you got this main girl who's sort of wacky.

445
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,789
Rym: Yeah, you got.

446
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:11,618
Rym: she's like Pinkie Pie.

447
00:31:11,901 --> 00:31:20,599
Scott: You got me got main energetic friend who reminds me of like Skeeter from Doug But his I guess his dad owns the is a shrine as a monk in the shrine or something like that.

448
00:31:21,303 --> 00:31:23,775
Rym: Oh, yes does remind me of Skeeter, right?

449
00:31:23,996 --> 00:31:27,959
Scott: Yeah We talked about the girl with the PA system.

450
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:32,599
Scott: We got the like dad who's like, you know that the go to school do a good job do something.

451
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,095
Scott: I love your life dad, but that dad was in a rock band.

452
00:31:35,155 --> 00:31:35,920
Scott: It was a hidden past.

453
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:39,230
Scott: You got grandpa who's making umbrellas, but you don't know why.

454
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,755
Rym: until then you find out why.

455
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:43,188
Rym: but then that ties into Grandpa's like.

456
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:44,560
Scott: don't go messing around with their mermaids.

457
00:31:45,681 --> 00:31:48,670
Scott: Grandpa clearly knows something about magic and isn't saying anything.

458
00:31:48,731 --> 00:31:51,600
Rym: grandpa's umbrellas tie into the death metaphor.

459
00:31:52,122 --> 00:31:55,420
Scott: He's a lot like the grandma and witches flower, right?

460
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:00,300
Scott: Oh, yeah, is that old character who is in on the magic deal, but they have the scenes they're done with it.

461
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,140
Scott: It's part of their past but now the young kid is experiencing it.

462
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:07,435
Rym: but they always have the scene where they see the evidence of the young kid interfacing with the magic.

463
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:10,239
Rym: and they always go like Mmm, like the knowing.

464
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:13,435
Scott: But they let it go because they know they turned out.

465
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:13,817
Scott: All right.

466
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,325
Scott: Yep You obviously have the crazy mermaids.

467
00:32:16,987 --> 00:32:21,640
Rym: the mermaid dad the giant hilarious that mermaid dad is is my second favorite character.

468
00:32:22,122 --> 00:32:23,266
Rym: Yeah is so great.

469
00:32:23,949 --> 00:32:30,619
Scott: You've got the the people who own like the fishing company in the town What you think is the main girls family, but to give you an example of like how?

470
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:40,705
Rym: Subtle because there's so little screen time for any of these characters to tell one of these stories that the PA system girl That's got mentioned earlier in The very beginning of the movie.

471
00:32:40,967 --> 00:32:46,534
Rym: There's just this disembodied voice coming over loudspeakers Announcing like some mundane crap.

472
00:32:46,554 --> 00:32:47,580
Rym: that's happening in the town.

473
00:32:48,061 --> 00:33:01,056
Rym: It's like the background sound during the panning shots and the establishing shots and it's really annoying and funny Because she says everything like and today today ten here all these echoes.

474
00:33:01,657 --> 00:33:09,998
Rym: the town council Will be meeting will be meeting will be and it's like really drawn out and funny this.

475
00:33:10,178 --> 00:33:11,865
Scott: and it's a running jet It's a running gag.

476
00:33:11,925 --> 00:33:14,720
Scott: every time she makes an announcement, but then that run you don't know.

477
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:18,873
Scott: You hear them mention the characters name they're like, oh so-and-so is making the announcements.

478
00:33:19,174 --> 00:33:22,184
Rym: you never see this person another characters like Oh, she's back in town.

479
00:33:22,224 --> 00:33:23,227
Rym: Wow, that's sad.

480
00:33:23,247 --> 00:33:44,010
Rym: Yeah, and then not only is her arc important, but the specific issue with the echoing is both important in the Literal plot at the end of the movie and is important to explain her arc and the arc of another character To get so much value out of a

481
00:33:44,331 --> 00:33:47,279
Scott: running running joke about the town being structured in a way.

482
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,580
Scott: There's a fishing village right and we're talking about Lou over the wall.

483
00:33:50,861 --> 00:34:00,260
Rym: This is literal rock wall in the town that casts a shadow over the town almost like the historical Legacy of the town cast the shadow over the future.

484
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,812
Scott: I was like a legend of like the wall keeping mermaids out or something.

485
00:34:03,832 --> 00:34:06,200
Scott: the shadow of the wall is the shrine at the top.

486
00:34:06,401 --> 00:34:08,813
Rym: Is the only reason the mermaids even live here.

487
00:34:09,156 --> 00:34:09,940
Rym: the mermaids are?

488
00:34:10,442 --> 00:34:11,527
Rym: You see where I'm going with this.

489
00:34:11,608 --> 00:34:23,871
Rym: Yeah, the mermaids get burnt by the Sun like vampires yep, but it's almost like the shadow of history is both Informing the town but also holding the town back.

490
00:34:23,891 --> 00:34:28,547
Scott: I mean, oh well is like the easiest metaphor All time right.

491
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:33,010
Scott: walls and fire are like a two Two go-tos that are so easy.

492
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,159
Scott: It's like the softball is things ever?

493
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,539
Rym: So you should see this movie.

494
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:42,833
Scott: If you're an anime fan go see this movie kids to see.

495
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:44,139
Scott: I don't know how you can see it.

496
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,760
Scott: I'm sure it'll be available streaming or star somehow at some point.

497
00:34:48,202 --> 00:34:51,018
Scott: I kind of want to see it subtitled instead of L dub just to see.

498
00:34:51,038 --> 00:34:55,487
Rym: yep I didn't want to get into spoilers at this point because I feel like we just see this movie But I do want to.

499
00:34:55,507 --> 00:34:56,739
Rym: it's not really a spoiler.

500
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:14,016
Rym: But the only thing that bothered me at all, but it did bother me was that they coded Lou the mermaid pretty young like very young child But simultaneously framed it as almost a sasami situation of technically.

501
00:35:14,056 --> 00:35:14,558
Rym: She's 900 years old.

502
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:27,323
Rym: but they also coded her relationship with the main character as both childlike wonder big brother like show me the world and Romantic.

503
00:35:27,705 --> 00:35:33,063
Scott: I read it more as a The.

504
00:35:33,144 --> 00:35:36,417
Scott: the girl is like some sort of alien and she doesn't really.

505
00:35:36,437 --> 00:35:44,412
Rym: I did too I know and the movie does go out of its way to make it clear that They that they the mermaids do not understand humans.

506
00:35:44,693 --> 00:35:46,800
Rym: They are these ageless weird beings.

507
00:35:47,141 --> 00:35:55,711
Rym: they are utterly alien, but at the same time she acted like a little kid and then this Much older kid was very much romantically interested in right.

508
00:35:55,731 --> 00:35:57,777
Scott: well imagine of Lou is like a teenager.

509
00:35:57,797 --> 00:35:58,680
Scott: that would have been also

510
00:35:59,661 --> 00:36:04,119
Rym: Now if Lou was also a teenager that would have been more monster girl that would have been more much more, okay

511
00:36:04,864 --> 00:36:09,679
Scott: Mmm, but then you got to start like, you know I think it'd be creepy because like then you start putting boobs on there and shit.

512
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:13,037
Rym: She could have been a little coated a little older.

513
00:36:13,118 --> 00:36:17,040
Rym: but That's interesting because not really a spoiler again.

514
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:21,600
Rym: But like I said, the mermaids are very clearly also used as a metaphor for death.

515
00:36:22,102 --> 00:36:29,560
Rym: like there's a scene early on where he takes Lou around and They garner an animal shelter where there's a bunch of dogs.

516
00:36:30,342 --> 00:36:34,114
Rym: It is clear those dogs were going to be put down like that is obvious.

517
00:36:34,295 --> 00:36:35,840
Scott: Yep, so don't to adults.

518
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:41,810
Rym: Yeah, Lou bust open the wall Turns all the dogs into mermaid dogs.

519
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:44,357
Scott: The mermaid dog is the best character in.

520
00:36:44,377 --> 00:36:48,972
Rym: the mermaid dog Continues to be an important part of the story all the way to the.

521
00:36:49,152 --> 00:36:51,060
Scott: yes, but the mermaid dog is the best character.

522
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:58,277
Scott: It's a cute doggie that's super excited but instead of two leggies he's got a little mermaid tail where the plushies.

523
00:36:58,537 --> 00:37:01,565
Scott: I want to see them not without giving spoilers.

524
00:37:01,585 --> 00:37:10,716
Rym: just trust me that there there are many points where the idea of someone becoming a mermaid is very Specifically tied to the idea that that person has died.

525
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:18,639
Rym: Yep Simultaneously that is reinforced by Lou Saving all the dogs in the shelter by turning them into mermaids.

526
00:37:19,442 --> 00:37:27,115
Rym: During that scene Lou when the main character isn't looking Almost turns him into a mermaid.

527
00:37:27,135 --> 00:37:43,736
Rym: Mm-hmm There is a reading of this that this kid was depressed in contemplating suicide maybe not at the point of actually consciously contemplating it but on that road and That's pretty apparent the way he interacts with everyone and the way other characters are all sort of worried about

528
00:37:43,776 --> 00:37:43,997
Scott: him.

529
00:37:44,077 --> 00:37:52,569
Rym: and because it's Japan Yeah, so that is the tip of the iceberg of the Interesting things to read into this movie.

530
00:37:52,609 --> 00:38:06,134
Scott: Yeah, most of the situations in which the mermaids turn humans into Mermaids, you know killing saving them right our situations in which that human is in dire life-threatening danger And that's why it seems like they're saving them.

531
00:38:06,154 --> 00:38:10,111
Scott: It's like oh, they're gonna die I'll turn them into a mermaid so they don't die.

532
00:38:10,211 --> 00:38:15,509
Scott: or but turning into a mermaid is dying And it's hard to really like.

533
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:18,660
Rym: I promise we could back the things we're up saying up quite a bit more.

534
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,147
Rym: But just see the movie.

535
00:38:20,248 --> 00:38:22,780
Rym: I don't want to like ruin all these little tiny details.

536
00:38:23,121 --> 00:38:26,492
Rym: You'll you'll get it and it's real good and it's definitely worth seeing.

537
00:38:26,532 --> 00:38:30,346
Scott: it's worth seeing more than any other anime movie I've seen in recent months.

538
00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:33,720
Rym: This is the best anime movie I have seen since.

539
00:38:35,161 --> 00:38:35,945
Rym: What what is the?

540
00:38:36,206 --> 00:38:37,792
Rym: what's the last movie paprika?

541
00:38:38,355 --> 00:38:39,479
Scott: No, you're going that far back.

542
00:38:40,423 --> 00:38:45,059
Rym: What's the movie since paprika that we would say is better than this better than that.

543
00:38:46,141 --> 00:38:46,742
Scott: I need to look at it.

544
00:38:46,922 --> 00:38:48,124
Rym: Yeah, I did it.

545
00:38:48,244 --> 00:38:51,870
Rym: Nothing immediately jumps to mind for an anime movie at least.

546
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,029
Rym: hmm, I Might be able to name an animated movie.

547
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,120
Scott: I like summer was more than this.

548
00:38:59,361 --> 00:39:01,887
Rym: Yeah, I think summer wars was a simpler story.

549
00:39:01,907 --> 00:39:07,080
Rym: Yes, but somewhere this is in the same level of quality as summer wars.

550
00:39:07,281 --> 00:39:08,547
Rym: I'll definitely agree with that.

551
00:39:08,628 --> 00:39:09,392
Scott: It's real close.

552
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:18,265
Rym: Yeah the in terms of animation It's also summary in war Z and I will say if the only way you can see this in the theater is a dub Dub is totally fine.

553
00:39:18,445 --> 00:39:18,726
Scott: It's not.

554
00:39:18,746 --> 00:39:19,448
Scott: game won't kill you.

555
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:20,913
Rym: the dub works.

556
00:39:21,394 --> 00:39:23,260
Rym: I don't feel like I'm not seeing it.

557
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,740
Rym: Yeah, but the double the dub did not sound like an anime dub.

558
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:31,980
Scott: It sounded more like a character who's clearly also voiced by someone who does voice them a little pony.

559
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:34,969
Rym: Yeah, but that is still didn't sound like an anime dub.

560
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:43,590
Scott: it sound more like a normal cartoon voiceover I think for the first few minutes cuz I don't watch a lot of dubs the Disjointedness of the voices plus the mouth movement.

561
00:39:43,691 --> 00:39:46,300
Scott: Yeah, but you know, it put me in that dub.

562
00:39:46,421 --> 00:39:49,180
Scott: It gave me that dub feel in my body, but then it went away.

563
00:39:49,461 --> 00:39:53,378
Rym: Yeah, and you know when you watch a typical anime dub that feeling never goes away.

564
00:39:53,418 --> 00:39:53,820
Rym: That's true.

565
00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:02,520
