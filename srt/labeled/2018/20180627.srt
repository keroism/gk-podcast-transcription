00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,911
Rym: It's Wednesday June 27th 2018.

2
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:12,873
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:15,319
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,140
Rym: Holy crap.

5
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:19,490
Rym: We're reviewing an anime made in abyss.

6
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:24,397
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:28,769
Rym: So I've been doing something.

8
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,253
Rym: I haven't done in a long time.

9
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:32,156
Rym: I've got out pooping.

10
00:00:32,177 --> 00:00:36,430
Rym: I got out my trumpet My trumpet that I get annoying noises.

11
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,137
Scott: It's not something you don't haven't done in a long time.

12
00:00:38,157 --> 00:00:38,680
Scott: There's something you do.

13
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:45,490
Rym: Trumpet playing is more Athleticism Than it is like actual.

14
00:00:45,692 --> 00:00:47,160
Scott: you know, it's making annoying noises.

15
00:00:47,783 --> 00:00:50,477
Rym: So I haven't played my trumpet seriously in like 15 years.

16
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,883
Rym: so I started playing it again.

17
00:00:51,923 --> 00:01:01,800
Rym: cuz I do would take me about a month of playing every single day to get my Strength just like my physical ability back up to me like an approximation of what I used to be back.

18
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,272
Rym: And I was thinking about doing it professionally and I don't know what I'll do after that.

19
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:18,680
Rym: It seems like good exercise and I actually here's how old this was I had to buy new valve oil because that valve oil I had was so old and it denatured and basically turned into kerosene.

20
00:01:19,342 --> 00:01:21,229
Rym: Okay, it smelled like kerosene.

21
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:22,955
Rym: I had to throw it away too bad.

22
00:01:22,995 --> 00:01:25,384
Scott: It didn't melt your trumpet So you couldn't make annoying noise.

23
00:01:25,404 --> 00:01:26,910
Rym: That's like a $3,000 trumpet.

24
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:27,773
Rym: It ain't melting anything.

25
00:01:27,814 --> 00:01:28,416
Scott: Well sell it.

26
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,092
Rym: I Thought about selling it at RIT to pay for like food.

27
00:01:33,735 --> 00:01:34,357
Rym: I'm glad I didn't.

28
00:01:34,397 --> 00:01:35,220
Rym: I'm glad I held on to it.

29
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:36,611
Rym: Really love that trumpet.

30
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:39,426
Scott: I'm not glad You would have sold it.

31
00:01:39,446 --> 00:01:41,560
Scott: So you got a. you could no longer make annoying noises.

32
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,271
Rym: I'm still playing it out with my 3c mouthpiece, but I do.

33
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:44,834
Rym: I did fine.

34
00:01:44,874 --> 00:01:46,360
Rym: I had an old 5a mouthpiece.

35
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:53,100
Rym: I've been playing with that one that It's hard to play in the upper register with that 5a, but it makes a really good sound in the low stuff.

36
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:53,988
Rym: So we'll see.

37
00:01:54,371 --> 00:01:59,155
Rym: maybe around Christmas time I'll just go to the subway on a weekend and play Christmas music and bus can see how that goes.

38
00:01:59,175 --> 00:02:03,617
Rym: I Could be a dozen air if I work hard on that.

39
00:02:05,182 --> 00:02:06,610
Scott: Good do it far away from me.

40
00:02:07,032 --> 00:02:08,240
Rym: So anyway got any anime news.

41
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:13,178
Scott: There's not a lot of anime or comic news right now because San Diego comic-con is very soon.

42
00:02:13,198 --> 00:02:17,880
Scott: Yep Everyone is charging their laser and holding back on any kind of news.

43
00:02:18,302 --> 00:02:24,186
Scott: But the one kind of news they're not holding back on is hey everyone come check out shit That's we're gonna tease you about.

44
00:02:24,226 --> 00:02:27,339
Scott: that's gonna be at San Diego comic-con that you can spend money on.

45
00:02:27,862 --> 00:02:40,829
Scott: That morons will wait in line for yeah But one of these things is the first time I've ever is actually the first time I've seen something that was like an extending your comic-con exclusive that I Wanted an amount more than zero.

46
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:42,455
Scott: It's not much more than zero like.

47
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,600
Rym: I'm not gonna try again.

48
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:53,133
Scott: I'll be willing to spend like 50 cents to get one of these which I'm sure is much less than the actual price I want it but for the fact that I do not want physical things anymore.

49
00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:59,320
Scott: I know right it's like but anyway So what basically the what's going on is, you know, it's a he-man action figure.

50
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,561
Scott: It's like.

51
00:02:59,582 --> 00:03:02,660
Scott: well, I already owned he-man action figures in my life and I got rid of them.

52
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,644
Scott: Why would I want another one?

53
00:03:03,664 --> 00:03:06,596
Rym: pretty sure my mom actually still has mine and it's like.

54
00:03:06,857 --> 00:03:09,128
Scott: now that I'm an adult I realized I don't even like he-man.

55
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:10,837
Scott: I only liked it because I was a kid and it was stupid.

56
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:21,820
Scott: That's why kids because he's stupid man's crappy except it has a castle and a sword and a skeleton Which is why I liked it, which is the only part they still like and also orko, but other no one else likes orko.

57
00:03:21,921 --> 00:03:23,169
Rym: Anyway, I don't like orko.

58
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:24,578
Scott: Oh and modulock was a good toy.

59
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:27,567
Scott: Anyway They're making a he-man action figure.

60
00:03:27,627 --> 00:03:29,333
Scott: but it is not just any he-man action figure.

61
00:03:29,353 --> 00:03:36,660
Scott: it is the hey Laughing he-man action figure complete with pink sword.

62
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,158
Scott: So that's whoever made that pretty smart.

63
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:50,900
Scott: I'm sure people are gonna line up at the front of the con and then like how it's just gonna run to the booth that They sell these and buy them all right away and then put them right on eBay for a lot of money.

64
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,252
Rym: I like how it's just called laughing Prince Adam.

65
00:03:53,514 --> 00:03:54,619
Scott: Well, I mean what else you gonna call it?

66
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:55,726
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

67
00:03:55,766 --> 00:04:00,972
Rym: Yeah, I mean if you start typing hey Into YouTube, it's like I know what you're looking for.

68
00:04:01,554 --> 00:04:02,760
Rym: I know what you're trying to find.

69
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:07,276
Scott: Well, you type hey, but as soon as you add one more letter that it's like, okay We're good here.

70
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:20,784
Rym: So in some much less fun news and it's relevant if you're going to Otakon the big anime con well, we don't go anymore because Otakon is you know moved to DC a while ago and Otakon's on the decline.

71
00:04:20,904 --> 00:04:25,980
Rym: the Nazis are trying to have a big rally at the same time, right?

72
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:27,289
Scott: They don't know about Otakon.

73
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,580
Scott: No, they're not rally.

74
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:37,690
Scott: They're just having a rally in DC and it happens to be near Otakon at the same weekend as Otakon by coincidence Yep, which is kind of bad.

75
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:38,994
Rym: I mean, it's I don't.

76
00:04:39,014 --> 00:04:40,860
Rym: it's always bad news when the Nazis show up.

77
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:45,180
Scott: I mean there have been not Nazi incidents at Otakon when I was there.

78
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,840
Rym: Yeah, in fact I have video of a Nazi incident from Otakon I want to say 2005.

79
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,307
Scott: so I there must.

80
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:56,400
Scott: there are people who are attending Otakon who are clearly prone.

81
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,226
Rym: I don't have that video.

82
00:04:57,286 --> 00:04:58,675
Rym: James and Pete have that video.

83
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:03,012
Scott: Mmm The point is there are pro Nazi kids at Otakon to begin with.

84
00:05:03,113 --> 00:05:05,260
Scott: Yeah, they don't need any help from not see.

85
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,670
Rym: I'm in the Otakon forum and I already see some people defending the free speech rights of the Nazis.

86
00:05:10,071 --> 00:05:16,073
Scott: Uh-huh People posted such things in my forum.

87
00:05:16,093 --> 00:05:21,434
Scott: I would Withdraw their badges, especially since I'm handing them out at the door.

88
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:22,520
Scott: I can keep them out.

89
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,840
Rym: I guess we're still technically Otakon staff because they never formally informed us of being kicked out or anything.

90
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,326
Scott: Can you log into the Otakon staff?

91
00:05:29,707 --> 00:05:31,153
Rym: It says my account is suspended.

92
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:35,120
Rym: Okay, so then I think you're suspended But they didn't follow all that procedure that I saw it.

93
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:55,943
Rym: There's two anyway, if you are going to Otakon or if you even were thinking about going to Otakon You should go to the National Mall and Memorial Parks website and register a formal complaint about the dangers of this rally and how you think it is unsafe for the rally to occur because maybe we can prevent this Nazi rally from Occurring.

94
00:05:56,528 --> 00:06:09,360
Rym: so if you're an anime fan also I'm sure there'll be a lot more people at Otakon than there will be at the Nazi rally and we were at Pac South during Trump's original travel ban and Bunch of people left the con to go protest at the airport, right?

95
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:18,420
Scott: You can get probably more people just from Otakon alone To go and harass the Nazis and make their life miserable while wearing awesome cosplays.

96
00:06:18,761 --> 00:06:24,157
Scott: Yeah, and that would be real good if you did that don't wear your a Hetalia cosplay though.

97
00:06:24,178 --> 00:06:27,998
Rym: No At least not certain Hetalia cosplay.

98
00:06:29,165 --> 00:06:35,679
Scott: If you are a Gundam cosplay make sure it's Earth cosplay Not a Zeon cosplay.

99
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:39,840
Rym: Yeah, Zeon's a little too soon to talk about Zeon right now.

100
00:06:40,721 --> 00:06:55,154
Rym: So in some other worst news and I got to bring it up because it just happened and it's pretty big deal if you didn't notice a Supreme Court justice just resigned and if you're in the US That's a really really bad thing to have happened right now.

101
00:06:55,555 --> 00:07:03,385
Rym: like to the point that Everyone listening to these words if you're above 18, you got a fucking vote If that even helps.

102
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:04,811
Rym: Yeah, you got to do it.

103
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:15,874
Rym: Anyway, and you got a vote straight ticket Democrat No exceptions, if you're uncomfortable about the fact that we're talking about politics right now I don't think you should even be listening to GeekNights and I don't respect you.

104
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:32,321
Rym: Okay, so Read this story and for the love of God votes, but anyway, it's time for Things of the day Moving right along here.

105
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:33,230
Scott: We already had things of the day.

106
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:38,250
Rym: This is the first time we both watched the same anime all the way through.

107
00:07:38,531 --> 00:07:40,161
Scott: So now you're confident you have enough mean bit.

108
00:07:40,201 --> 00:07:42,574
Scott: You don't have to drag out the news I'm so.

109
00:07:42,675 --> 00:07:45,510
Rym: I think we could talk about the show for way longer than we're gonna okay.

110
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,830
Scott: So anyway, so I wasn't sure if I should use this thing of the day, but it's kind of funny video.

111
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,963
Scott: It's very New York video.

112
00:07:51,004 --> 00:08:01,658
Scott: Well early gentlemen Went down on the subway tracks for who knows what reason he appears in this video to be Under the influence of some sort of something.

113
00:08:01,678 --> 00:08:03,083
Rym: He's enjoying himself, right?

114
00:08:03,103 --> 00:08:03,424
Scott: He's like.

115
00:08:03,464 --> 00:08:05,130
Scott: he's like chillin and checking his phone.

116
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:14,870
Scott: They say he was laying on the tracks previously, which is disturbing But the video is not about the the disturbed man or the police who go and pick him up and take it.

117
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:15,534
Rym: He's fine.

118
00:08:15,554 --> 00:08:16,983
Rym: The cops are sure they're like, come on.

119
00:08:17,426 --> 00:08:17,989
Rym: Come on guy.

120
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:24,510
Scott: It's about the people the very New York people on the platform saying things like get your ass up here.

121
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:25,567
Scott: I need to get on the train.

122
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:29,641
Scott: Go kill go commit suicide somewhere else.

123
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,167
Scott: You're holding the train up.

124
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:35,210
Rym: It's uh You know, we taught in the early GeekNights days because we were fresh.

125
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,710
Scott: I just want to give you a feel of what New York is like.

126
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,798
Scott: Yeah Cuz honestly this is a very accurate New York video.

127
00:08:41,018 --> 00:08:52,970
Rym: something on this level happens to me once a week like by default Like I got no exaggeration Something on this level I experience on a weekly basis at minimum sometimes multiple times per week.

128
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:56,366
Rym: In fact, if a week goes by and nothing weird happens, it's sort of weird.

129
00:08:56,507 --> 00:09:06,680
Rym: It's a boring week Yeah But I remember way back in early GeekNights because we were fresh out of college and we were really missing University life and we talked a lot about how we missed the burning couches.

130
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:09,749
Scott: not literally because honestly you saw burning couch recently.

131
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:17,770
Rym: now No, I saw a burning couch last summer But not specifically burning couches because to be honest the burning couch was funny.

132
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:21,649
Rym: But it also stunk up the area outside of our apartment for like three days.

133
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:29,225
Rym: But we missed the fact that when we were in university Crazy shit kind of just happened all the time and it was just like this.

134
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:33,168
Rym: background to our lives Living in New York really brought that back.

135
00:09:34,731 --> 00:09:38,789
Rym: So my thing of the day, uh, I don't think Scott knows what a hurdy-gurdy is.

136
00:09:39,191 --> 00:09:42,462
Scott: I mean, I know it's like it's either Beatles thing or is that flint?

137
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:44,710
Scott: There's like a song but the hurdy-gurdy man or something.

138
00:09:45,172 --> 00:09:46,256
Scott: So, I don't know what the day.

139
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:47,421
Scott: I never bothered to look it up.

140
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:49,410
Rym: What do you think a hurdy-gurdy man does?

141
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,554
Rym: Like the reefer man.

142
00:09:51,935 --> 00:09:57,350
Scott: I imagine you know just based on the language that it's somehow somewhat akin to a hobo.

143
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,478
Rym: So now a hurdy-gurdy is actually a medieval instrument.

144
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:04,957
Scott: All righty I guess that is why it is musically related.

145
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:08,610
Rym: a way to describe it to a layman would be cross a violin with bagpipes.

146
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:12,198
Rym: But a better way to put it is how does that work?

147
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:20,790
Rym: So it drone, you know bagpipes have a drone like a constant tone Yes, and also music like also a melody possibly a melody and a harmony.

148
00:10:21,313 --> 00:10:29,479
Rym: So this is basically a violin where you have a something instead of a bow that is Constantly making the strings vibrate.

149
00:10:29,981 --> 00:10:30,624
Scott: Oh, it's not.

150
00:10:30,685 --> 00:10:35,570
Scott: it's not a sack full of air It's just the strings are always vibrating and then so they're always making this noise.

151
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:41,647
Rym: Then you and you play it with basically a modified keyboard that is working kind of like how fingers would.

152
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,375
Scott: so it's sort of like an accordion.

153
00:10:43,495 --> 00:10:44,521
Rym: almost so in that.

154
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:49,590
Scott: so an accordion with strings String pipe an accordions a string into accordion.

155
00:10:49,731 --> 00:11:01,090
Rym: Anyway, if you don't know what a hurdy-gurdy is if you watch this video You will know what a hurdy-gurdy is and you may find out that actually you like hurdy-gurdy music, which I do And I like bagpipe music as long as the thing is it's weird.

156
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:10,569
Scott: I like bagpipe music as long as it's like recorded bagpipe music or on TV or something a live bagpipe That is very close to you makes me want to puncture the bagpipe.

157
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:16,930
Rym: Well, the point of a bagpipe is that you hear it from and remove the kilts from the person who is playing the bagpipe.

158
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:24,250
Rym: Generally bagpipe performances the bagpipers are quite far away from the audience not when they're in a parade in the street in the city.

159
00:11:24,792 --> 00:11:25,476
Rym: Yeah, I like.

160
00:11:25,556 --> 00:11:28,108
Rym: I like the parade bagpipes though only if it's.

161
00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:31,990
Rym: you know The problem is is like my favorite thing is when there's a shitty marching band.

162
00:11:32,552 --> 00:11:37,750
Rym: But the bagpipes that came by before them are so loud that they're still overpowering the shitty marching band.

163
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:39,493
Scott: They're too loud.

164
00:11:39,534 --> 00:11:41,461
Scott: It just hurts my ears and I cannot hear the music.

165
00:11:41,662 --> 00:11:43,470
Scott: the drone overpowers the the music.

166
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:55,130
Scott: When people record bagpipe music in the studio or whatever they you know The drab the drone part gets mixed way down or perhaps removed and you only hear the nice.

167
00:11:56,892 --> 00:12:00,630
Rym: So in the meta moment the book club book home is Odyssey by Emily Wilson.

168
00:12:00,711 --> 00:12:07,590
Scott: We keep talking about it sometime soon this summer Definitely a bit today because I took the train today instead of biking and it's gonna rain tomorrow.

169
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:08,710
Scott: So I'm gonna read more tomorrow.

170
00:12:08,851 --> 00:12:11,610
Rym: I'm gonna try to blitz through it and finish it sometime in the next month or so.

171
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,355
Rym: This will probably be the episode.

172
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:14,278
Scott: just read it.

173
00:12:14,499 --> 00:12:16,023
Rym: It ain't long and it's good.

174
00:12:16,585 --> 00:12:20,360
Rym: Otherwise, look forward to us at PAX West.

175
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,877
Rym: I Think that's our next con.

176
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:23,400
Rym: Yeah.

177
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,702
Rym: Yeah PAX West and all the other packs is and There's a good chance we'll be cuz it's you know, Wednesday.

178
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:29,386
Rym: I got anime.

179
00:12:29,587 --> 00:12:30,170
Rym: This is a good chance.

180
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,027
Rym: We'll be at anime NYC.

181
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,117
Rym: I'm gonna put in some panels Even if we don't get any battles.

182
00:12:34,137 --> 00:12:37,070
Scott: am I go over there for a day cuz gonna pay money to go there for a day?

183
00:12:38,151 --> 00:12:42,590
Rym: I'm confident I can get myself a badge that is not costing me money somehow.

184
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:48,309
Rym: But I can take the subway to it and generally I'll go to a con that I can take a subway to.

185
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,375
Scott: yeah And it's not a time of this good weather.

186
00:12:50,675 --> 00:12:51,357
Rym: Yeah, exactly.

187
00:12:51,598 --> 00:12:59,200
Rym: Now if it happens to somehow be a glorious 80 degrees sunny day Hooray, then probably not going to that count.

188
00:12:59,221 --> 00:13:00,286
Rym: It looks like a panel schedule.

189
00:13:00,327 --> 00:13:03,147
Scott: It's got two days We can go to the world or three or two or three days.

190
00:13:03,348 --> 00:13:08,130
Scott: three I'm sure at least one of the days will be not 80 degrees in what November?

191
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:09,838
Rym: Yeah, but it'll probably be.

192
00:13:09,858 --> 00:13:15,068
Rym: if we go to any anime cons ever again It's probably the only one we're ever gonna go to and perform at.

193
00:13:15,108 --> 00:13:18,226
Rym: so The good news is their panel slots are only 45 minutes long.

194
00:13:19,552 --> 00:13:25,087
Rym: Way easier to write a 45 minute panel than a 60 minute panel, especially for anime.

195
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:30,830
Rym: we can do a lot of topics We normally wouldn't be able to fit into an hour and the new anime season is starting real soon.

196
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,400
Scott: So we're gonna be judging that season like this weekend.

197
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,864
Scott: Maybe I don't get the video out.

198
00:13:36,085 --> 00:13:36,827
Scott: Hopefully next week.

199
00:13:37,028 --> 00:13:37,289
Scott: We'll see.

200
00:13:38,975 --> 00:13:39,319
Scott: It's work.

201
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:43,650
Rym: Yeah It is indeed work so made in abyss.

202
00:13:44,451 --> 00:13:45,455
Rym: We actually watched it.

203
00:13:45,595 --> 00:13:48,445
Rym: It's an anime and I think it's based on a new one.

204
00:13:48,886 --> 00:13:49,910
Scott: Yeah, did we judge it?

205
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:52,010
Scott: I don't remember if we judged it or not.

206
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:59,107
Rym: I don't know if we judged it or not Because I tend to only watch like three or four of the anime we judge at any time.

207
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,150
Rym: we judge, right?

208
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,093
Scott: So here's the deal.

209
00:14:01,153 --> 00:14:07,094
Scott: It's an anime and in this anime there is it's a fantasy world and in the fantasy world I think is earth.

210
00:14:07,455 --> 00:14:09,381
Rym: No spoilers will save spoilers for the end.

211
00:14:09,422 --> 00:14:09,883
Rym: So don't worry.

212
00:14:10,124 --> 00:14:13,423
Scott: There's some island and on the island There's a big-ass fucking hole.

213
00:14:13,463 --> 00:14:13,665
Scott: It's just.

214
00:14:13,725 --> 00:14:16,214
Scott: it's just like a Completely isolated island.

215
00:14:16,676 --> 00:14:21,589
Scott: It's just like, you know, and the whole island is a big hole and there's like a ridge around the hole with this town.

216
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,477
Scott: There's a ridge around the hole where everyone lives like.

217
00:14:23,517 --> 00:14:27,152
Scott: it's some RPG or some shit and the hole is the abyss and it goes Down.

218
00:14:27,173 --> 00:14:27,877
Scott: no one know.

219
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:29,810
Scott: it goes all the way down like way down.

220
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:34,170
Scott: I don't think it even has a bottom and there's like, you know, they have maps of it and at the bottom of the map.

221
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:34,684
Scott: It's just like wow.

222
00:14:35,771 --> 00:14:38,563
Rym: Now the gist of the show is what's the deal with the abyss?

223
00:14:38,764 --> 00:14:39,387
Scott: It's as terrible.

224
00:14:39,407 --> 00:14:40,190
Scott: so you get a space.

225
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:42,122
Scott: Whoo, wait, where did the abyss come from?

226
00:14:42,223 --> 00:14:43,270
Scott: Why is it the way it is?

227
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:51,397
Scott: Why is there a fantasy world down there and but not outside of it, but unlike say a darker than black Where there's a secret in space?

228
00:14:51,738 --> 00:14:54,888
Rym: and then they do all this other nonsense and the secret in space.

229
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:55,590
Rym: just in the background.

230
00:14:56,012 --> 00:14:57,739
Rym: This show is a beeline.

231
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,767
Rym: It's basically here's the characters.

232
00:15:00,028 --> 00:15:00,610
Rym: There's the abyss.

233
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:05,530
Rym: They're going fucking as far down as possible as fast as possible and that is the plot.

234
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,643
Scott: Yeah, there's a character and her mom was like an abyss master.

235
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:09,245
Scott: They have like this.

236
00:15:09,305 --> 00:15:10,390
Scott: It's a very RPG, right?

237
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:10,853
Scott: They have like.

238
00:15:10,873 --> 00:15:13,070
Rym: it feels very secret of mana.

239
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:18,688
Scott: Yeah, it's like they have these colors of whistles for like how strong you are going in the abyss.

240
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:19,190
Scott: JRPG.

241
00:15:19,392 --> 00:15:19,776
Rym: Oh, they're.

242
00:15:19,898 --> 00:15:22,830
Rym: she's a white whistle The strongest right?

243
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:29,516
Scott: So her mom was a white whistle who went to the bottom of the abyss and she gets a note from mom saying come find Me at the bottom.

244
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:34,290
Scott: so she's like well Even though I'm just a little kid with a little red whistle who doesn't know what they're doing.

245
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:40,897
Scott: I'm going to that bottom and we're gonna as the viewer you're gonna learn all about the abyss because all you want to do Is know what's the deal?

246
00:15:40,937 --> 00:15:41,400
Scott: What's the deal?

247
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,370
Scott: Because there's so many things to know what's the deal with?

248
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,158
Scott: You know, where did this person come from?

249
00:15:45,218 --> 00:15:47,369
Scott: Where did these mother with the abyss come from so far?

250
00:15:48,090 --> 00:16:00,730
Rym: How come this unlike say attack on Titan that just doesn't even get close to the secret in space and when it does It's stupid so far at least having watched one whole season of this and there'll be more season one.

251
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:01,213
Scott: There's a man.

252
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:05,489
Rym: Yeah, this manga does not actually end the story But it is a pretty good place.

253
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,679
Rym: like I feel pretty good about where it ended.

254
00:16:07,739 --> 00:16:08,341
Rym: like I don't feel.

255
00:16:08,803 --> 00:16:12,264
Rym: I don't feel like I did at the end of The first attack on Titan season.

256
00:16:12,425 --> 00:16:17,405
Rym: No It feels like it's going somewhere and it feels like there's a real secret.

257
00:16:17,425 --> 00:16:18,730
Rym: That'll probably be interesting.

258
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:26,760
Scott: It's like they don't answer necessary the questions that you're asking but they keep revealing more things and which then Give you more questions, right?

259
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:31,030
Scott: Yeah, it's like I think this, you know How much is spoilers or whatever?

260
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,446
Rym: We'll get to a spoiler line.

261
00:16:32,506 --> 00:16:38,010
Scott: and well The main thing is there's this like a curse of the abyss where going down is easy.

262
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:42,310
Scott: Anyone can go down as long as you don't get killed by some horrible monster or something like that.

263
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:46,049
Scott: Yes, it's a really hazardous place that gets more hazardous the deeper you go.

264
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:48,490
Scott: But there's nothing inherent about the abyss.

265
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,626
Scott: Like if you just had a rope and came from the sky you would go all the way to the bottom.

266
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:52,330
Scott: just no problem.

267
00:16:52,793 --> 00:17:01,361
Scott: But if you try to go up in the abyss horrible things happen to you immediately like if you go in a little bit and then like you let's see you take a few steps Down and come back up.

268
00:17:01,402 --> 00:17:02,150
Rym: I'll get like a headache.

269
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,037
Scott: You'll be like dizzy just because right.

270
00:17:04,098 --> 00:17:10,910
Scott: and if you go down maybe like they have levels of the abyss if you go down Like one level and come back up you'll be like vomiting and nauseous like crazy.

271
00:17:11,111 --> 00:17:15,556
Rym: Yeah, go a little further like blood just starts spurting out of your eyes But only if you go up.

272
00:17:15,777 --> 00:17:20,630
Scott: as long as you're going down or horror or staying at the same elevation You're not affected.

273
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:29,385
Scott: but if you try to go up out of if you're already in the abyss and you try to go upwards towards the out of the Abyss that's when you know this sort of curse just nails you.

274
00:17:29,426 --> 00:17:30,370
Scott: there's even situations.

275
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:40,213
Scott: We're like they're in the abyss standing on like a tree or something and they want to get into this tree house That's above them and they're looking at it like The tree.

276
00:17:40,253 --> 00:17:47,389
Scott: the people in the treehouse lower like an elevator basket thing and they get in the elevator And it's like the elevator is only going up a little bit.

277
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,414
Scott: But it's like oh my god, if I get in this elevator that goes up to the tree house I'm gonna be all sick aren't I?

278
00:17:51,454 --> 00:17:55,370
Scott: it's like yes, they get out of the elevator like vomiting all over the place.

279
00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:01,210
Rym: Let's talk a little bit about the world because the main characters like the people we follow in the show are little kids.

280
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,154
Scott: They're like 12.

281
00:18:02,154 --> 00:18:05,810
Scott: Yeah, they're little kids right and they're drawn in a very cute way.

282
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,296
Scott: Well, one of them is not maybe a kid.

283
00:18:07,517 --> 00:18:11,939
Scott: Well, one of them is a robot who we don't know how old it is Yeah, but it is.

284
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:14,010
Scott: it is a robot 12 year old child.

285
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:22,708
Scott: It could be like a hundred year old robot that looks like a 12 year old child but it has the mentality of a 12 year old child and the and the visual appearance kids and they're all red whistles.

286
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:26,073
Rym: and the storytelling we get.

287
00:18:26,134 --> 00:18:41,946
Rym: there's some environmental storytelling and some characters explain things and there's little details that kind of fill in the picture, but Basically, there's an orphanage in this town and all the kids in the orphanage Basically are made to go down into the abyss Get artifacts and bring them back

288
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,992
Scott: up Very

289
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:45,040
Rym: RPG style and as they get better

290
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,490
Scott: see it doesn't seem to be an abusive orphanage.

291
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:54,703
Scott: It seems to be like an okay orphan like it's pretty legit like the kids die It's like it's like it's strict, you know, we're like the but it's not.

292
00:18:54,923 --> 00:18:57,090
Scott: you know, it's not like an evil orphanage like Oliver.

293
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,387
Rym: You know one of those guys later in the show you see what the evil orphanage looks like.

294
00:19:01,628 --> 00:19:07,245
Rym: Yes But like the kids go down and get these artifacts and here's why the shit like.

295
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,521
Scott: one of the reasons I like the show and It's like it's like there's a mystery of like whoa.

296
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,129
Scott: Why the fuck is this abyss full of artifacts?

297
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:12,891
Rym: Yeah, it's.

298
00:19:13,092 --> 00:19:14,777
Rym: it's all precursor technology.

299
00:19:14,797 --> 00:19:18,810
Rym: And as you know, that is one of my main things.

300
00:19:19,031 --> 00:19:22,590
Scott: They also find like they constantly find skeletons in the abyss.

301
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:26,461
Scott: Skeletons are always praying.

302
00:19:26,622 --> 00:19:28,050
Rym: there's three things in the abyss.

303
00:19:28,431 --> 00:19:34,990
Rym: There's priceless artifacts from an ancient and unknown civilization that some of which are like powerful magic items.

304
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:40,610
Scott: And also for some reason the deeper you go the artifacts become more complex and more powerful and amazing.

305
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:49,402
Rym: So it's like you go down one level you find like a plus one sword go down three and you find a weird magic box That like blows up if you look at it and like weird stuff.

306
00:19:49,543 --> 00:19:51,049
Scott: It's like how did this come to be?

307
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,474
Rym: There's monsters down there.

308
00:19:53,956 --> 00:20:08,210
Rym: Yep, and there's prey and the monsters are more dangerous as you go deeper because it's JRPG Yep, and there's all your monsters guard the better treasure but buried everywhere in a circle around the abyss are skeletons in a praying position.

309
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:10,421
Rym: No one knows where they came from.

310
00:20:10,482 --> 00:20:11,527
Scott: they don't tell you the viewer.

311
00:20:11,889 --> 00:20:17,028
Rym: well so you get the impression right away because there are people who know stuff that you don't see as the viewer.

312
00:20:17,108 --> 00:20:20,309
Scott: and the Characters you see in the show don't tell you the viewer.

313
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:26,070
Scott: Yeah You can see people in the show who clearly know more than they let on like the white whistle people.

314
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:34,230
Scott: But people still tell other characters like a lot of info like they're not they don't hold back Yeah, but it's like this one point where they go to this place.

315
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:38,810
Scott: That's like a museum of relics or whatever and they're there to see some specific things.

316
00:20:39,352 --> 00:20:42,724
Scott: But it's like what all this stuff is in there that we're not seeing.

317
00:20:42,744 --> 00:20:44,570
Scott: Yeah, it's like a huge building.

318
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,960
Scott: It's like what are the scientists who work there?

319
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,205
Scott: No, what are the archaeologists?

320
00:20:48,265 --> 00:20:49,290
Scott: No, they must know something.

321
00:20:49,652 --> 00:20:55,221
Rym: so the abyss is basically this pit and It's either maybe a spaceship crash.

322
00:20:55,281 --> 00:20:57,833
Rym: Maybe it's some precursor technology Like.

323
00:20:57,973 --> 00:21:00,121
Rym: we don't know the show no idea what it is.

324
00:21:00,403 --> 00:21:02,330
Scott: It could be anything could be a portal another world.

325
00:21:02,611 --> 00:21:07,610
Rym: It's implied that there were other abysses all over the earth and that this is the last one.

326
00:21:07,812 --> 00:21:09,229
Scott: Oh, I didn't catch that at all.

327
00:21:09,531 --> 00:21:10,434
Rym: Talk about how.

328
00:21:10,454 --> 00:21:12,080
Rym: they mentioned this a couple times early on that.

329
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:18,590
Rym: This is like the only unexplored one Mmm that there were other holes that were like had similar things.

330
00:21:19,372 --> 00:21:27,354
Rym: And there's also this sort of side sub story about like all these nations in the world warring This abyss.

331
00:21:27,455 --> 00:21:28,499
Scott: they do allude to that.

332
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:38,541
Scott: I don't know what they don't explain it enough, but they're definitely Stories they tell about like the cave raiders or the people go down to get relics and how they play with other cave raiders On other countries, right?

333
00:21:38,561 --> 00:21:43,670
Scott: It's like for some reason I guess this island where the abyss is must be some sort of neutral territory.

334
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:56,100
Scott: But the abyss itself is not or the nation that controls it now like won that war like yeah there was a war in the past where they destroy where they won and now that that country or Controls the abyss or maybe the whole world they control.

335
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,530
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, this is like these unnamed countries.

336
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,915
Scott: You don't know the deal is so.

337
00:21:59,975 --> 00:22:04,372
Rym: the main character is this girl who lives in the orphanage and she's a red whistle and normally Kids.

338
00:22:04,432 --> 00:22:14,911
Rym: just as they get better at learning these cave reading skills They progressed like blue whistle and right and like you see they show you people who have you know Higher whistles and they're clearly stronger, you know They've.

339
00:22:15,012 --> 00:22:17,424
Scott: they've gone into the abyss enough that they've with their.

340
00:22:17,565 --> 00:22:21,679
Scott: with their greater strength They can go deeper and come up without vomiting and they can.

341
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,407
Rym: they're also super strong like diving like they like.

342
00:22:24,728 --> 00:22:26,678
Rym: they have Artifacts that help them.

343
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,850
Rym: They also just have gained skills.

344
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:32,850
Rym: It's like you dive too deep scuba diving and then you have to like do special things on your way back.

345
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:40,330
Scott: They're higher-level RPG characters and they can go into the abyss deeper and beat stronger monsters and do more awesome stuff.

346
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:48,449
Rym: so like the kids go way deep like in the early part of the show like deeper than they should and There's people who are down there who are totally okay.

347
00:22:48,892 --> 00:22:52,450
Rym: We're just higher level than them and they interact with those people and interesting stuff happens.

348
00:22:52,892 --> 00:22:58,478
Rym: But the general plot is that this there's one girl Here's our main character and her mom was a white whistle.

349
00:22:58,699 --> 00:23:02,350
Rym: the white whistles are the only people who have no depth limit.

350
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:08,508
Rym: They're allowed to go as deep as they want and they're basically on their own discretion and no one can tell them for what.

351
00:23:08,668 --> 00:23:13,600
Scott: they're also All like legendary people like they know like all the names of all the white whistles.

352
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,776
Scott: Yeah, there's not too many of them and they're all they're.

353
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:23,658
Scott: all Whistle is like a unique.

354
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:25,429
Scott: they have to wear physical whistles on their neck.

355
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:29,870
Scott: Yeah, they have like all these unique whistles where it's like all the red whistles are the same red whistle, right?

356
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:41,413
Scott: like the white whistles are all unique and like one guy's got these like two skull hands like two skeleton hands holding each other as his white whistle and you know, it's like whoa, what's up with that dude and This girl?

357
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:46,528
Rym: her mom was a white whistle and either disappeared or died down in the abyss.

358
00:23:46,849 --> 00:23:57,429
Rym: Yes, and She Wants to go find her mom and find out what the deal is because a letter comes up from the abyss that says meet me Mm-hmm, and she's no other papers from mom as well.

359
00:23:58,132 --> 00:24:02,630
Scott: And mom's white whistle and a robot kid and a robot kid.

360
00:24:02,971 --> 00:24:14,010
Scott: Well, the robot kid doesn't come up with the mom stuff, but in the notes that mom sent back There's a picture of the robot kid, which is there must be some connection between mom and the robot kid.

361
00:24:14,393 --> 00:24:16,289
Rym: And the robot kid doesn't remember anything.

362
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,000
Rym: Nope, but has terrifying powers.

363
00:24:19,301 --> 00:24:21,810
Scott: and see the robot kid really actually only has two powers.

364
00:24:21,931 --> 00:24:23,680
Rym: He has well bionic commando arms.

365
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:23,981
Scott: Okay.

366
00:24:24,022 --> 00:24:29,086
Rym: No, he's bionic commando arms Great strength and immune to the curse of the abyss.

367
00:24:29,106 --> 00:24:31,216
Scott: because he's a robo He's immune to the curse of the abyss.

368
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:34,470
Scott: Yeah, and also some crazy super powered cannon in his arm.

369
00:24:34,751 --> 00:24:42,810
Rym: yep, and the cannon in his arm is very like Spear of longinus level technology, it's ridiculously powerful.

370
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:46,163
Scott: But if he uses it he shuts down and then has to recharge and then wakes up.

371
00:24:46,223 --> 00:24:57,788
Rym: now one thing the show does and other shows Like mushishi or there's a lot of shows that have done this over the years where there's rules of how things work like magic systems or whatever has rules But doesn't have too many.

372
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:58,532
Scott: They're pretty much.

373
00:24:58,592 --> 00:25:08,890
Rym: the rule is like if you go to too deep in the abyss coming back up sucks or like if he uses that In a certain amount of time he'll pass out for a certain number of hours, right?

374
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:18,538
Scott: Well, he recharges his bat and there's some rules, but they're like societal rules Like, you know, we don't we don't allow red whistles to go deeper than level one because they can't handle it But it's like nothing stopping you from doing that.

375
00:25:18,598 --> 00:25:20,184
Rym: It's like if they go past level two.

376
00:25:20,526 --> 00:25:21,530
Rym: Well, good luck.

377
00:25:21,873 --> 00:25:27,255
Scott: Yeah, you can't come in after you know Because even if we come back after you if we try to pick you up and bring you back to the service You'll just die.

378
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,404
Scott: You'll die while we do that.

379
00:25:28,504 --> 00:25:29,936
Scott: So Go.

380
00:25:29,997 --> 00:25:36,709
Rym: so the girl Spoilers from the very beginning of the show and the robot just fucking go forward and jump down into the.

381
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:39,280
Scott: yes I mean this isn't spoiler cuz like that's the shows about.

382
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,244
Scott: it's like they just fucking.

383
00:25:40,344 --> 00:25:45,690
Scott: once they know the mom is down there They just go and as the show progresses, I'm into it.

384
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,412
Rym: It's pretty cool.

385
00:25:46,452 --> 00:25:53,230
Rym: Like the the rate of learning new things versus new mysteries arising is the exact opposite of attack on Titan.

386
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:53,314
Rym: Yeah

387
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:57,604
Scott: it's like you actually keep learning new stuff meeting new people people who tell you stuff

388
00:25:57,885 --> 00:25:58,989
Rym: and just as it is

389
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:07,770
Scott: and They also show you as you're going deeper seeing more stuff You know as the characters go deeper and getting into trouble and out of trouble and whatnot.

390
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:09,376
Scott: They don't they don't.

391
00:26:09,517 --> 00:26:12,910
Scott: it's like the top part of the world that you got used to in the first two episodes.

392
00:26:13,211 --> 00:26:16,143
Scott: They still keep flashing up there showing you what those other guys.

393
00:26:16,184 --> 00:26:27,741
Rym: the interesting thing the plot progresses on the surface Even though based on everything, you know, there is literally no way these characters could ever return Like this is a one-way trip.

394
00:26:27,882 --> 00:26:29,629
Rym: and yet you keep seeing the.

395
00:26:30,452 --> 00:26:32,643
Scott: maybe they could stay down there until they become so.

396
00:26:32,743 --> 00:26:44,070
Scott: white whistle strong true because Many years in the future if they somehow survive in the abyss for the super long time like a decade or two Then they could come back up because one thing we don't know leveled up enough black.

397
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:53,216
Scott: Well, maybe if they found some powerful artifact that allowed them to come back up black whistles and blue whistles or maybe they could defeat the curse of the abyss and beat the final boss and then Everyone could come back up.

398
00:26:53,316 --> 00:26:56,953
Rym: of course defeat destroy removing the curse might be a bad idea I don't know.

399
00:26:57,556 --> 00:27:03,505
Scott: I don't know enough because yeah, even watching the whole for a season I don't know enough about the abyss to know if that's even a thing that you can do.

400
00:27:04,008 --> 00:27:18,810
Rym: but Black whistles and blue whistles like they go pretty deep like way deep and come back up and once you watch the show a little Bit and you see like what level two is like and they're like, yeah These blue whistles are down to like level four just fucking around like, okay, that's interesting.

401
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:21,829
Rym: I guess that's what a like 17th level Bard can do.

402
00:27:22,594 --> 00:27:29,122
Rym: but the white whistles are Very much not quite human anymore.

403
00:27:29,643 --> 00:27:31,732
Scott: No, they're all really weird Like.

404
00:27:31,792 --> 00:27:34,210
Rym: I don't want I won't spoil anything about this character.

405
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:45,018
Rym: But the first white whistle you meet is Oh Zen the immovable and holy shit that character Very very powerful individual.

406
00:27:45,158 --> 00:27:48,550
Scott: that is a fascinating character with some like insane strength.

407
00:27:48,891 --> 00:27:52,850
Rym: Like you meet a I think a blue whistle or a black whistle that the dwarf looking guy.

408
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:54,638
Scott: Oh my god, he's basically like the uncle.

409
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:55,684
Scott: I love that guy.

410
00:27:55,744 --> 00:28:05,350
Scott: He looks like, you know typical RPG like fat dude with a with a blue doe beard the guy who's like way dangerous, but everyone underestimates him, right?

411
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,662
Rym: He needs the kids like pretty deep early on in their adventure.

412
00:28:08,682 --> 00:28:10,410
Rym: He's like, whoa, what are you doing down here?

413
00:28:10,712 --> 00:28:12,080
Rym: And they're like we're fucking going for it.

414
00:28:12,121 --> 00:28:17,005
Scott: He's like, all right, cool Well, he's friendly and good guy, but it's like he's not white whistle.

415
00:28:17,045 --> 00:28:26,069
Scott: He's like one under that But he's like right but he's but he's way super strong and super fast and he can you know, he's like, whoa He's and he's like do you need help?

416
00:28:27,212 --> 00:28:29,624
Scott: He's the one who brings back the mom stuff to begin with.

417
00:28:29,684 --> 00:28:31,656
Rym: Yeah, and they're like no No, we're going for it.

418
00:28:31,717 --> 00:28:39,870
Rym: And he's like, okay just heads up Oh Zen the immovable watch out Watch out The.

419
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:49,974
Rym: Occasionally the show edges a little too much into a character explaining something But it usually then immediately Escalate.

420
00:28:50,034 --> 00:28:59,610
Scott: well, I mean explaining something is better than not explaining Especially when it's a show that's a hundred percent focused on this one secret of space with no other stuff going on Like.

421
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:06,293
Scott: it doesn't get into like the explaining is so much like there's like a lot of character dramas or other things to spend their Time on.

422
00:29:06,334 --> 00:29:08,570
Scott: it's like the whole show just spends all its time.

423
00:29:10,192 --> 00:29:15,210
Rym: The light novel translated into an anime problem where it's just characters fucking explaining everything and nothing happened.

424
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:16,814
Scott: It's a manga.

425
00:29:16,914 --> 00:29:18,701
Scott: So, I don't know if it's a light novel or not.

426
00:29:18,742 --> 00:29:19,444
Scott: I'm pretty sure.

427
00:29:19,465 --> 00:29:20,810
Scott: I'm pretty sure it was originally a manga.

428
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:23,339
Scott: I don't know how far the manga goes.

429
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:26,290
Rym: I want to find way beyond where the show was so far.

430
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,154
Scott: You know that for sure.

431
00:29:27,315 --> 00:29:28,500
Scott: Yeah, so I should read the manga.

432
00:29:28,762 --> 00:29:30,490
Rym: the manga is still going right?

433
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,721
Scott: But the manga is out in English at least a few volumes.

434
00:29:32,802 --> 00:29:33,324
Rym: Yeah 2012 it started.

435
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,600
Scott: It's still going but but it goes beyond what the anime does.

436
00:29:37,801 --> 00:29:45,829
Rym: Yes, so I should read it and to know more right now or wait, because I Feel like you'll spoil a lot of stuff for the anime.

437
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:46,673
Scott: I don't know if I would.

438
00:29:46,693 --> 00:29:47,917
Scott: I can read the manga instead.

439
00:29:47,937 --> 00:29:49,142
Scott: and just because the anime.

440
00:29:49,342 --> 00:30:03,083
Rym: the one problem with this show is That based on having watched the show and based on having read a little bit of the manga pretty sure Akihito Tsukushi the guy who wrote the manga is a pervert.

441
00:30:03,585 --> 00:30:03,725
Scott: Mmm.

442
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:04,930
Scott: That is true of many money.

443
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:05,010
Scott: The

444
00:30:05,191 --> 00:30:19,719
Rym: anime tones it down and now that the show and let we've been saying there's a lot now in our own lives Some anime have something I like to call the anime tax meaning if a person who is not steeped in the world of like the Shit that happens in anime.

445
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:27,565
Rym: because of the way anime is Watches certain shows they can't deal with it and have to pay the tax like kill la kill.

446
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:30,374
Rym: if you show it to your mom She'll be.

447
00:30:30,575 --> 00:30:38,226
Rym: you'll be trying to explain the complex metaphor of clothing and presentation And everyone's naked with boobies on and your mom's gonna be like why isn't that girl wearing pants?

448
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:51,900
Rym: Yeah, so Every now and then this show Will something will happen and they'll be naked twelve-year-olds and you'll be like, okay That was weird, but then we just moved on and it.

449
00:30:52,321 --> 00:30:54,086
Rym: it could be innocent, but you don't know.

450
00:30:54,106 --> 00:31:09,241
Rym: but having looked at the manga Yeah, we know The a. yeah, so it seems like in this world Carrot like adults will just to punish children String them up by ropes naked and upside down for like a day.

451
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:09,743
Rym: is it like?

452
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:15,369
Rym: that's the equivalent of spanking in this world And that is brought up more than once.

453
00:31:16,611 --> 00:31:20,365
Scott: There's also multiple scenes where she's like going swimming just gets naked.

454
00:31:20,385 --> 00:31:21,088
Scott: She doesn't care.

455
00:31:21,168 --> 00:31:29,702
Scott: Yeah Basically the main character a twelve-year-old girl is naked Frequently more often than is prudent or comfortable.

456
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:30,284
Rym: the robot boy.

457
00:31:30,324 --> 00:31:30,725
Scott: who is her?

458
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:33,908
Scott: companion and friend?

459
00:31:34,755 --> 00:31:37,270
Scott: They take these on multiple occasions.

460
00:31:37,853 --> 00:31:43,394
Scott: They specifically call out how he has a human penis that works well because she keeps checking it out.

461
00:31:43,414 --> 00:31:52,022
Scott: there's even a scene in which he is aroused while they're in like swimming or something and A twelve-year-old robot boy and it's over hold.

462
00:31:52,042 --> 00:32:01,981
Rym: good due to the nature of the abyss there are a lot of because this show gets really really dark and Violent and difficult to watch.

463
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:03,550
Rym: so these irrespective of that, right?

464
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,690
Scott: So you have these character designs like Monica style right that are super super cutesy.

465
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:14,610
Scott: They're not like SD, but they're like one step above SD and then but like breaking an arm is hyper realistic, right?

466
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,658
Scott: They're like they have broken.

467
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,089
Scott: Ah, they break an arm.

468
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:29,561
Scott: they're like vomiting and and all kinds of horrible horrible things are happening characters, but dangerous and urinating themselves due to pain happens Kind of often frequently.

469
00:32:29,742 --> 00:32:31,908
Rym: Yes now to.

470
00:32:32,931 --> 00:32:43,909
Rym: Despite having said all that the anime does a good job of minimizing the occasional weird things And it doesn't intrude into the show enough to say to where I would say you shouldn't watch it.

471
00:32:44,772 --> 00:32:46,820
Rym: the show is still really good.

472
00:32:47,181 --> 00:32:54,129
Rym: that stuff is definitely sidelined and Could be interpreted as innocent and just part of this world and part of the show.

473
00:32:55,291 --> 00:33:05,587
Rym: But be warned that if you are uncomfortable watching very cute characters who are Presented as like 12 year old kids being hard being horribly mangled by a monster.

474
00:33:05,607 --> 00:33:10,070
Rym: Yeah Experiencing the reality of traumatic injury.

475
00:33:11,273 --> 00:33:12,321
Rym: This show is not for you.

476
00:33:12,341 --> 00:33:16,970
Rym: No But I've thoroughly enjoyed the show and I'm going to watch the sequel.

477
00:33:17,051 --> 00:33:18,218
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's it's.

478
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:24,509
Scott: I'm not gonna say it's like the best show ever But it's a very good very good show and I want to mostly just you know.

479
00:33:24,891 --> 00:33:27,441
Scott: It managed to provide a secret to space.

480
00:33:27,461 --> 00:33:28,225
Scott: that was good.

481
00:33:28,325 --> 00:33:29,409
Scott: It made me want to know it.

482
00:33:29,651 --> 00:33:31,469
Scott: It made me want to know it's not like I don't care.

483
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:32,653
Scott: Yeah, I really want to know.

484
00:33:32,673 --> 00:33:38,699
Scott: and it managed to not do a attack on Titan where the answer is bullshit at least not yet.

485
00:33:39,488 --> 00:33:45,470
Scott: and It managed to also give information at like a pretty good clip without spilling all the beans.

486
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:51,357
Scott: It like continued to spill meaningful beans, not bullshit beans Like alright, they just keep giving you.

487
00:33:51,478 --> 00:34:08,085
Rym: you learn more and more about the abyss and it you know, you're moving right along Yeah, and I guess if you liked shows like Madoka Magica or Shinsekai Yori from a new from the new world like there's interest overlap there with those kinds of shows.

488
00:34:08,106 --> 00:34:16,561
Rym: I Don't know if we should but I think we should maybe do a separate like final thoughts episode, but Maybe wait until you see more season.

489
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,750
Rym: Yeah, but I will say there's only 13.

490
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,096
Scott: Maybe we should wait at least 26.

491
00:34:20,096 --> 00:34:21,281
Rym: I didn't want to avoid spoilers.

492
00:34:21,341 --> 00:34:35,109
Rym: But if you read the prince of nothing This abyss feels a lot like Golgotha wrong like a lot and Like those eggs like those weird egg looking things that nobody knows what they do.

493
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:39,001
Rym: Yeah, like like you find they find these egg looking things in the upper levels.

494
00:34:39,021 --> 00:34:42,150
Rym: They're like weird technology like there and there's tons of them.

495
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:49,549
Scott: Yeah, and they go deeper and they find more but when the ones that are deeper are more complicated But they're not worth anything because no one knows what to do with them.

496
00:34:49,851 --> 00:34:53,409
Rym: Yeah, like some of the artifacts like at least they do something useful.

497
00:34:53,933 --> 00:34:56,549
Scott: But some yes, some of them they figured out what they do.

498
00:34:56,951 --> 00:35:00,609
Rym: But like the girl has to learn to like not pick all this stuff up on her way.

499
00:35:00,991 --> 00:35:03,244
Rym: The inventory management is a big part of this show.

500
00:35:03,304 --> 00:35:04,309
Rym: It's very JRPG.

501
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,662
Scott: Look, they might not only going up is difficult enough.

502
00:35:06,682 --> 00:35:08,030
Scott: They're gonna carry a bunch of heavy shit.

503
00:35:08,251 --> 00:35:13,089
Scott: Yeah, like you went down there to collect artifacts and now you're going like in pub G and carrying things.

504
00:35:13,391 --> 00:35:15,599
Rym: Do you really need another scope?

505
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:17,847
Rym: You only have one rifle just like leave it there.

506
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:18,750
Rym: It's fine.

507
00:35:19,173 --> 00:35:21,370
Scott: Well, what if the next day comes and gets it now they got a scoop?

508
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:24,123
Rym: Yeah, well then pick it up and like throw it in the water or something.

509
00:35:24,143 --> 00:35:25,470
Scott: I wish there was easier ways to do that.

510
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:28,446
Rym: Yeah, I leave stuff out and try to leave traps.

511
00:35:28,486 --> 00:35:32,910
Scott: It doesn't work No, but anyway, if you could make traps in pub G that would be great.

512
00:35:33,191 --> 00:35:35,441
Rym: that's for tonight almost has stuff like that.

513
00:35:35,502 --> 00:35:38,248
Rym: like you can build structures and like fortifications.

514
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,110
Rym: anyway.

515
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:43,629
Rym: Yeah, I don't really want to spoil anything about this show.

516
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:48,310
Scott: But yeah, if you need it, if you like a fantasy anime that's you know, got some JRPG elements.

517
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:51,890
Scott: This is the best new anime I've watched in a while like a terrible secret of space.

518
00:35:52,011 --> 00:35:57,963
Scott: Then this is 13 episodes for you in a u.s If you want to watch it legally I could only find it on Amazon Prime's.

519
00:35:58,024 --> 00:36:01,961
Scott: if you Amazon Prime Yeah, you can watch it for zero dollars because you've already paid for it.

520
00:36:02,402 --> 00:36:06,065
Scott: And if you don't have Amazon Prime Find some other way to watch it.

521
00:36:06,085 --> 00:36:06,348
Scott: I don't know.

522
00:36:06,652 --> 00:36:14,998
Rym: Oh, and I guess cuz I kept asking this question You see a lot of art and a lot of memes a lot of Twitter chatter about this show But they pretty much only show the rabbit girl.

523
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:18,810
Rym: The rabbit girl doesn't actually show up until like the end of the season.

524
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:22,239
Rym: Yeah, but the rabbit girl is that.

525
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:23,341
Rym: this is that show.
