1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,001
Rym: It's Monday September 17th 2018.

2
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:15,258
Rym: I'm Rym, I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:20,840
Rym: tonight We're talking about that weird EU copyright law and upload filters and all that kind of nonsense.

4
00:00:23,631 --> 00:00:24,667
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:25,872 --> 00:00:26,695
Rym: Yeah, it's been a while.

6
00:00:26,956 --> 00:00:30,953
Rym: So weird to not do shows for that long except over the holidays Mm-hmm.

7
00:00:31,855 --> 00:00:32,377
Rym: I guess we were.

8
00:00:32,397 --> 00:00:36,690
Rym: we had packs and then we tend to get lazy after packs and just not do like shows.

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,754
Scott: I got other stuff to do.

10
00:00:37,814 --> 00:00:39,360
Scott: I got a clean laundry.

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,930
Scott: put away my all of my things on pack.

12
00:00:42,371 --> 00:00:47,330
Scott: Yeah, today the show was under threat of not even how to happening again because I was stuck in a ball pit.

13
00:00:47,692 --> 00:00:51,190
Rym: Yeah, but luckily while you were stuck in a ball pit, I was stuck dealing with something at work.

14
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,334
Rym: So we both got home late.

15
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:52,675
Scott: Mm-hmm.

16
00:00:53,197 --> 00:00:56,730
Rym: So I worked out and last week actually it just turned out so many.

17
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,817
Rym: You know that I have a new job.

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,005
Rym: It's actually been.

19
00:00:59,025 --> 00:00:59,770
Scott: it's not that new.

20
00:01:00,051 --> 00:01:14,209
Rym: It's been exactly one year since I started that new job and I know this because when I started the job I left my previous job earlier than I had planned Because they wanted me to come to this giant global summit of like the whole group that I'd work with.

21
00:01:14,872 --> 00:01:18,129
Rym: So I went to this giant summit not knowing anything of how it was going on a year ago.

22
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:23,730
Rym: So this year the same summit happened again, but now I know what I'm doing and I'm in charge a lot of this business.

23
00:01:23,831 --> 00:01:30,489
Rym: So I had to actually go to the summit and it as a result It meant that I didn't really have time to do shows last week.

24
00:01:30,951 --> 00:01:35,790
Rym: So we had an extra week of not doing shows which sucks because there's a ton of gaming news.

25
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:38,780
Rym: There's a ton of like anime we've watched to review.

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,870
Rym: We actually have a pretty deep hopper for everything except Monday.

27
00:01:44,232 --> 00:01:51,345
Rym: So we had to come over the show to do tonight because I didn't want to just bail on yet another show and stay tuned cuz we'll be reviewing like walk on girl.

28
00:01:51,405 --> 00:01:55,278
Rym: the night is short and Middle manager Tony gawa.

29
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:56,382
Rym: There's a ton of games.

30
00:01:56,402 --> 00:01:58,730
Rym: We've been playing but it's Monday.

31
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,957
Rym: So you got any other opening bits anything new.

32
00:02:00,977 --> 00:02:02,381
Scott: I was in a ball pit.

33
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:04,548
Rym: how big was this ball pit about?

34
00:02:04,889 --> 00:02:11,146
Scott: you know like bigger than a rich person's swimming pool, but smaller than the public pool.

35
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:14,560
Scott: I Can see that so big pretty is pretty deep.

36
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,284
Scott: you could go below.

37
00:02:15,304 --> 00:02:19,282
Scott: you can go deep so deep in the balls No one would see you and then step on you.

38
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:20,850
Rym: That sounds like a recipe to get stepped on.

39
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:22,894
Scott: Yeah, there was stepping on.

40
00:02:23,235 --> 00:02:24,439
Rym: so how do they?

41
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:24,699
Rym: cuz?

42
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,990
Rym: I assumed this was a ball pit for adults as a ball pit for all.

43
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,337
Scott: Okay, mostly filled with adults.

44
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:33,310
Rym: How do they sanitize those balls?

45
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,580
Rym: I'm just curious cuz I would have I would.

46
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:40,523
Scott: actually I thought of that myself And I said as soon as I get where I'm going I'm gonna wash my hands.

47
00:02:40,684 --> 00:02:42,030
Scott: Yeah, and then I forgot to wash my hands.

48
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,948
Scott: Oh Plagues are coming, but I brought that up when we were in the ball pit.

49
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:52,870
Rym: I'm like Yeah, I feel like once you're in the ball pit that quite like it's already too late.

50
00:02:53,051 --> 00:02:54,961
Rym: Yeah, yeah, cuz you're gonna touch your face.

51
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:55,986
Rym: They're gonna touch your face.

52
00:02:56,006 --> 00:02:56,770
Rym: There's no way out of that.

53
00:02:56,972 --> 00:03:02,422
Rym: I was completely submerged in balls But I tell the shares out about that.

54
00:03:02,442 --> 00:03:03,610
Rym: they might have an opinion.

55
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:06,349
Rym: So there's a lot of tech news.

56
00:03:06,712 --> 00:03:10,177
Rym: We actually have a lot more to say about the news than we might have on the main bed But there's plenty of news.

57
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:18,231
Rym: the main bit is one news By gonna miss a lot of the news you might think we were gonna talk about because if we don't talk about something that we Could.

58
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:19,557
Rym: happens we forget it happened.

59
00:03:19,678 --> 00:03:20,160
Scott: That's right.

60
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:22,070
Rym: It's how we were all here on GeekNights.

61
00:03:22,993 --> 00:03:26,930
Rym: But I guess we can start with the Apple news because there was actually kind of a lot of it.

62
00:03:27,351 --> 00:03:32,029
Scott: Well, I mean Apple Day, you know people don't realize right people like who is Apple gonna announce?

63
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:37,410
Scott: listen Apple is at the same announcement schedule for since maybe even before it was an RIT, right?

64
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:43,550
Scott: Yeah every September they announce back-to-school shit and that used to be iPods and then it became iPhones.

65
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,196
Rym: How they used to be iPods.

66
00:03:45,557 --> 00:03:50,554
Scott: every single September they announce iPods slash iPhones Every single one.

67
00:03:50,654 --> 00:03:55,869
Scott: they have done that since the time in the first iPod and maybe even since before.

68
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:56,779
Scott: then I don't even know how to go.

69
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:57,690
Scott: look it up, right?

70
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,736
Scott: You know in September they can announce iPhones.

71
00:03:59,756 --> 00:04:01,241
Scott: so they did and they also.

72
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,649
Scott: I watches in September right then it's CES.

73
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:07,359
Scott: That's where you get like your Mac, you know stuff.

74
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:08,422
Scott: that's for consumers.

75
00:04:08,462 --> 00:04:29,802
Scott: Like usually they spend way too long talking about I work The spreadsheet keynote thing right and then at the WWDC they always talk about the updates to the OS is in the software and how the App Store sells a million apps and you'll make a bunch of money if you make an app and Here's new MacBook pros because your developers right?

76
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:31,468
Scott: It's the same fucking schedule every year.

77
00:04:31,508 --> 00:04:32,130
Scott: So it's September.

78
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:33,876
Scott: Yeah, we got new iPhones.

79
00:04:33,996 --> 00:04:37,248
Scott: So I don't know people listening probably know this.

80
00:04:37,489 --> 00:04:41,943
Scott: I bought iPhone 3g the day it came out two years after that.

81
00:04:42,304 --> 00:04:46,380
Rym: I got an iPhone for you On the good upgrade cycle.

82
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,203
Scott: I got an iPhone.

83
00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:48,428
Scott: Well, cuz iPhone one was garbage.

84
00:04:48,549 --> 00:04:51,015
Scott: Yeah Right two years after that.

85
00:04:51,075 --> 00:04:53,063
Scott: I got iPhone 5 to use that to that.

86
00:04:53,103 --> 00:04:54,649
Scott: I got iPhone 6 to use.

87
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:57,640
Scott: after that I got an iPhone 7 and that iPhone 7.

88
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,769
Scott: I said, you know what they got this upgrade plan thing.

89
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:01,632
Scott: now Let me get on that Right.

90
00:05:01,973 --> 00:05:13,650
Scott: and the way it works is basically you buy the phone with a loan you pay off the loan monthly and then after a year When a new phone comes out in September, you can return the old phone because it is infinite Apple care.

91
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,790
Scott: So even if you damaged it, they'll repair it for free because the infinite Apple care.

92
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:24,310
Scott: Yeah And then you turn it in for what it's worth and that pays off your old loan Allow freeing you up to now get another loan to get a new phone.

93
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:34,323
Scott: So last year it was iPhone 8 and iPhone X and I you know and I was like, oh well I could turn in my iPhone 7 Get my loan paid off get a new loan get one of these new phones.

94
00:05:34,805 --> 00:05:36,170
Scott: and then I looked and I said wait a minute.

95
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,560
Scott: These new phones are more expensive than that old one.

96
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,950
Scott: Yeah when X is a thousand fucking dollars So are they more expensively better?

97
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:53,450
Scott: Well, the iPhone 8 is basically Almost identical to the iPhone 7. there's almost no difference between the iPhone 8 and iPhone 7. the difference is like so trivial.

98
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:55,149
Scott: They might as well be the same fucking phone.

99
00:05:55,672 --> 00:06:00,930
Scott: Right the iPhone X is way better except if you depending on how much the notch bothers you.

100
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,070
Scott: But other than the notch is just way better.

101
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,441
Rym: So the knowledge actually kind of bothers me a lot.

102
00:06:05,802 --> 00:06:10,230
Scott: but I mean, you know if you think about it, okay So what if they just blacked out the areas to the side of the notch?

103
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:11,526
Rym: That'd be fine.

104
00:06:12,114 --> 00:06:15,034
Scott: But you're basically you're getting more screen More screen.

105
00:06:15,054 --> 00:06:18,627
Scott: the only thing that goes next to the notch is like the time and date and your signal.

106
00:06:18,948 --> 00:06:22,910
Scott: that is true Who doesn't you know, so it's like you're getting more screen just by adding the notch.

107
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,640
Scott: It's like why not is my phone?

108
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,410
Rym: the screen just goes near the top of the phone.

109
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:28,056
Rym: So there's not like.

110
00:06:28,237 --> 00:06:35,159
Scott: well, the notch is used for all the face sign in which I would not enable But anyway, but you could use.

111
00:06:35,179 --> 00:06:37,348
Scott: I would still might use it for some me emojis.

112
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:41,130
Rym: Anyway, I saw some terrifying emojis.

113
00:06:42,371 --> 00:06:50,090
Scott: Better because it has mostly the main feature is the OLED screen which is a vastly superior screen to all screens and all other phones.

114
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:52,696
Scott: But it's a thousand fucking dollars.

115
00:06:53,158 --> 00:07:02,945
Scott: So I was like, well if I do the cash in though, then It's gonna be a bigger monthly loan payment And it's not that much and I'm not getting $1,000 phone.

116
00:07:03,207 --> 00:07:04,813
Scott: so fuck that Yep, so I didn't.

117
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:09,810
Scott: and then last month I paid off the loan in the iPhone 7s and now it's just mine.

118
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,610
Scott: I just paid it and it wasn't any more.

119
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:18,834
Rym: You know I gotta say back when I bought that Sunfire that like Cripo car that I drove around forever until it died and then it Got towed.

120
00:07:19,197 --> 00:07:19,902
Rym: and now it's gone.

121
00:07:19,922 --> 00:07:25,929
Rym: But I While I had it and I was paying my car payment I always thought I really want a better car.

122
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:33,903
Rym: But the moment my car was paid for and it was just mine Suddenly, I didn't want another car because this was just that's right car.

123
00:07:33,923 --> 00:07:35,269
Scott: That's why car dealers of the lease?

124
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:46,369
Rym: Yeah because every Leasing car every day that I continued to drive that shitty old car that I didn't own a car payment on was just Free money like free time before the next car payment.

125
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:47,293
Scott: Yep So now it's like.

126
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:50,630
Scott: well now my I'm basically increased my salary by like 50 bucks a month.

127
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:54,406
Scott: Yeah, and I got the same phone and they got new phones.

128
00:07:54,587 --> 00:07:57,437
Scott: So I was like, oh well I was expecting I was gonna get one of these new phones.

129
00:07:57,457 --> 00:08:05,765
Scott: so they came out with the iPhone XS the iPhone The XS XS Plus and the XR and the XR.

130
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:07,450
Rym: so I don't know what the deal is with the XR.

131
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,353
Rym: I actually didn't read about it.

132
00:08:08,473 --> 00:08:15,234
Scott: Oh, so the XS and XS Plus are basically the thousand dollar plus iPhone X Upgraded to be even better.

133
00:08:15,254 --> 00:08:17,339
Scott: Yeah, it's super expensive super big.

134
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,685
Scott: It's like buying the iPhone X only upgraded right?

135
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,530
Scott: All right iPhone XR.

136
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:27,790
Scott: It looks like an iPhone X. It has a lot of features of the iPhone X but some of those features are fake.

137
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:37,864
Scott: For example, the camera and the iPhone XS is like a super awesome double lens Riddick, you know thing right that's like a has a really wide aperture at least for a phone camera.

138
00:08:38,405 --> 00:08:47,088
Scott: the iPhone XR Pretends to have a wide aperture using some software to imitate Right, so it seemed you get some of those same features, right?

139
00:08:48,391 --> 00:08:49,816
Scott: But the iPhone XR also.

140
00:08:49,936 --> 00:08:55,240
Scott: it looks like it has the giant screen that the iPhone XS has but actually That's an LCD screen.

141
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,025
Scott: Not an OLED screen.

142
00:08:56,186 --> 00:09:01,950
Scott: Oh But it's still in terms of ratio that theoretically also potentially mean lower battery life.

143
00:09:02,492 --> 00:09:03,937
Rym: I don't know cuz the backlight would have to be.

144
00:09:03,957 --> 00:09:05,161
Scott: they have enormous batteries these.

145
00:09:05,181 --> 00:09:07,790
Scott: Oh, yeah way better than your stupid Android phones.

146
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,521
Rym: Anyway, my Android phone lasts like two days.

147
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:12,530
Rym: if I don't use it heavily iPhone last a long time.

148
00:09:12,812 --> 00:09:14,229
Rym: Your iPhone doesn't last two days.

149
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:19,890
Rym: All right, don't charge your iPhone at work and don't charge it tonight and see how long it gets into tomorrow.

150
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:23,799
Rym: Anyway, my Android phone is a lot of the.

151
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:27,450
Scott: the point is is that none of these all these phones are way more.

152
00:09:27,712 --> 00:09:28,760
Scott: You know the iPhone XR.

153
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,634
Scott: it was like the one I would get But I don't want to else.

154
00:09:31,754 --> 00:09:33,018
Scott: the LCD screen is not much.

155
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:34,752
Scott: I have an LCD screen I'll.

156
00:09:34,772 --> 00:09:39,090
Scott: the only major upgrade is an OLED screen which cost too much.

157
00:09:39,672 --> 00:09:41,258
Scott: So why would I get the iPhone XR?

158
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,674
Scott: and they're even still selling the iPhone 7 and 8 Right, which are way cheaper.

159
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:49,686
Scott: Like if you can get a new iPhone 7 now for like 500 something, right?

160
00:09:49,987 --> 00:09:51,010
Scott: Which is totally reasonable.

161
00:09:51,496 --> 00:09:57,626
Rym: Oh, you get a brand new Xperia and like the good phone for 200 220 iPhone 7 I think is much better.

162
00:09:59,492 --> 00:10:08,570
Scott: The point is even the iPhone XR which does give you a is bigger than the iPhone 7 But it gives you a lot more screen per phone size.

163
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,354
Scott: So it's like your phone.

164
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:12,749
Scott: your phone grows a little bit, but your screen grows a lot.

165
00:10:13,251 --> 00:10:13,592
Rym: I guess that.

166
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:22,650
Rym: what worries me though is still that the pressed in it sets because even the super tiny Android phones I'm getting they're creeping up a little bit like to get one millimeter water.

167
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,096
Scott: The thing is it none of.

168
00:10:25,337 --> 00:10:30,270
Scott: for once I waited two years and every two years that I waited there was a significant improvement.

169
00:10:30,411 --> 00:10:34,590
Scott: iPhone 3g was just a significant proven over every phone that came before it.

170
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:40,770
Scott: Yeah, the iPhone 4 I think added like was it was either the retina screen or LTE or some or the iPhone 5.

171
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:41,619
Scott: It was one iPhone.

172
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,307
Scott: I think I added LTE.

173
00:10:43,331 --> 00:10:51,775
Scott: Maybe the iPhone 5 added the retina screen I forget but like those iPhone 4 5 6 7 all of them added Somewhat significant features.

174
00:10:51,795 --> 00:10:56,950
Scott: All right, the 7 was added the button that you don't have to actually push and the fingerprint reader.

175
00:10:57,772 --> 00:11:00,661
Scott: It's like, you know, the features decreased in significance.

176
00:11:01,303 --> 00:11:02,748
Scott: It used to be Oh LTE now.

177
00:11:02,808 --> 00:11:07,684
Scott: Well, that's huge But now it's like they've decreased in significance so much.

178
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:12,041
Scott: I didn't fucking need New iPhone I just keep my iPhone 7.

179
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,863
Rym: Yeah I mean I only upgrade phones when my phone is worn out or can't do something.

180
00:11:16,084 --> 00:11:24,717
Scott: the old phone couldn't do that LTE+ like multiband whatever I used to upgrade because there was a significant better phone But now there isn't and they're all bigger.

181
00:11:24,737 --> 00:11:25,881
Scott: It's anyway.

182
00:11:25,982 --> 00:11:28,330
Scott: and also this one cost me nothing now and it's way good.

183
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:31,085
Scott: Yeah, and they updated my iOS today.

184
00:11:31,105 --> 00:11:31,668
Scott: It totally worked.

185
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:36,050
Scott: So they also announced a new Apple watch and that's actually so big deal.

186
00:11:36,611 --> 00:11:43,070
Rym: Watch is way better, but they got FDA approval on something because it might be a medical device.

187
00:11:43,391 --> 00:11:44,376
Scott: Yeah, it is a medical device.

188
00:11:44,396 --> 00:11:49,495
Scott: It can supposedly perform an ECG Which is kind of crazy.

189
00:11:49,716 --> 00:11:51,442
Rym: Yeah, and what's interesting is cut.

190
00:11:51,522 --> 00:11:52,525
Rym: I I suspect.

191
00:11:52,545 --> 00:12:06,790
Rym: I mean, I am NOT a doctor nor am I an expert on this technology, but Similar to the heart rate monitors where they're not super accurate Like like both watches and like Fitbits and everything like the heart rate monitors are not actually that accurate.

192
00:12:07,314 --> 00:12:09,149
Scott: But once you can strap to your chest that are better.

193
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:09,422
Scott: Yeah.

194
00:12:09,631 --> 00:12:19,973
Rym: But even then the point is that they're still getting data Consistently over time and that data could be used to infer things about one's health and I think this is actually a pretty good Well thing.

195
00:12:20,013 --> 00:12:21,981
Scott: the previous Apple watch also does this.

196
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:23,185
Scott: the one I have also does this.

197
00:12:23,246 --> 00:12:26,359
Scott: it just doesn't do it as well And it doesn't do the ECG.

198
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:31,899
Rym: Yeah, it just does regular heart rate monitor Or EKG as more commonly referred to in the u.s.

199
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,023
Scott: It's a lecture.

200
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,229
Scott: It's not electrocardiogram with a K.

201
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,033
Rym: Yeah Well, it's like the difference.

202
00:12:37,053 --> 00:12:42,650
Rym: you can tell where someone came from in their life if they say MRI or if they say NMR.

203
00:12:43,252 --> 00:12:44,275
Scott: Someone who says NMR.

204
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:47,444
Rym: I know people who say NMR because it's an MRI.

205
00:12:48,086 --> 00:12:49,570
Scott: It's MRI magnetic resonance.

206
00:12:49,831 --> 00:12:52,061
Rym: No, it's nuclear magnetic resonance imaging.

207
00:12:52,082 --> 00:12:53,006
Scott: Where's the nuclear part?

208
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:55,278
Rym: Uh, Do you know how MRIs work?

209
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,250
Rym: magnets not just magnets?

210
00:12:58,742 --> 00:13:02,964
Scott: Anyway The point is the new Apple watch is way better.

211
00:13:03,185 --> 00:13:08,562
Scott: The only thing is It's the one negative is that is bigger which exactly?

212
00:13:08,602 --> 00:13:10,890
Scott: for most people that biggerness is going to be an improvement.

213
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:18,728
Scott: No, I've already got the smallest goddamn Android watch there me though a bigger watch is not an improvement because my wrist is like a toothpick.

214
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:24,530
Scott: Yep So I'm gonna stick with this Apple watch 3 with LTE until it no longer functions.

215
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:31,350
Rym: Yep, I got the LG style which is pretty much the best like size price feature ratio.

216
00:13:31,491 --> 00:13:33,430
Scott: You can get also having this Apple watch, right?

217
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:41,824
Scott: The only improvements I can say that it has over the pebble watch that I previously had is that it's a lot more reliable In terms of its functionality.

218
00:13:41,945 --> 00:13:47,585
Rym: Yep but the The reliability was only a function of the bit rot of the software.

219
00:13:47,605 --> 00:13:56,056
Scott: The hardware was rock solid yeah, and also the Apple watch is better because in the pebble because The heart rate stuff.

220
00:13:56,237 --> 00:13:56,437
Rym: Yep.

221
00:13:56,839 --> 00:13:59,490
Rym: Well the pebble that never came out was gonna have a heart rate monitor.

222
00:13:59,691 --> 00:14:01,659
Scott: Yeah, but other than that, it's like that's.

223
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,754
Scott: you know, I don't what other feature gonna pass me None of this Apple.

224
00:14:04,815 --> 00:14:06,103
Scott: Yeah, you know, it makes it.

225
00:14:06,123 --> 00:14:09,170
Rym: so I don't have to look at the phone Yep, but you know what I want, you know what feature I want.

226
00:14:09,492 --> 00:14:12,870
Rym: I want to go back to a pebble style screen so I can have a battery in the last a week.

227
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:19,350
Rym: There's battery last pretty long time not a week No, not not so long that I didn't ever bring a charger with me when I traveled.

228
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,989
Scott: No, but also if it's heart rate monitoring it might need more battery, too.

229
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,317
Rym: Yeah true because actually I do the.

230
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:28,150
Rym: my one regret about my current watch is that it does not have heart rate monitoring.

231
00:14:28,513 --> 00:14:30,269
Rym: That's part of why it's so small and cheap.

232
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:42,744
Rym: So in some other news You know We talked about daylight saving without an s-time and now we have very strong opinions about it and most we believe Rightly in case you're not aware.

233
00:14:42,865 --> 00:14:43,550
Rym: Oh, yeah, we're correct.

234
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,239
Rym: Anyone else if anyone thinks otherwise is dead wrong on this.

235
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:52,117
Scott: the way the clocks are in the summer after they spring ahead is It is all correct.

236
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:57,953
Scott: that is the time and it should universally be that time now my Everywhere on earth.

237
00:14:58,014 --> 00:15:03,150
Rym: My rationale is very simple any daylight hours while I am at work are wasted.

238
00:15:03,451 --> 00:15:09,350
Rym: Yes, so I want there to be as much light as possible between when I leave work and when I go to sleep.

239
00:15:09,614 --> 00:15:15,699
Scott: I have a new better idea We should rearrange the entire schedule of our entire society So that we get to work.

240
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:25,089
Scott: if we're gonna assume we're gonna still work eight hours, which I would argue with Yeah, but assuming we still have to work that's gonna be a separate Thursday show in the future Assuming we still work eight hours and we're not gonna argue about that now.

241
00:15:25,531 --> 00:15:27,637
Scott: everyone should go to work at 10 p.m.

242
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:29,342
Scott: And leave at 6 a.m.

243
00:15:30,324 --> 00:15:38,605
Scott: And have as much fucking daylight as you want and then sleep When the Sun Goes Down and then wake up shortly before 10 p.m.

244
00:15:39,026 --> 00:15:39,448
Scott: To go to work.

245
00:15:39,849 --> 00:15:43,100
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I mean cuz my only work in this useless dark time.

246
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:52,990
Rym: I mean the trouble is human bodies Really need the lighting and the timing of life to work out or shit goes wrong like shit goes south.

247
00:15:53,612 --> 00:15:55,858
Rym: You got to sleep when it's dark.

248
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:58,807
Scott: Yeah, you sleep when it's dark until 10 p.m Then you wake up.

249
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:05,870
Rym: Yep, but Depending on where you live latitudes like what if you live in a place where it doesn't get dark during the summer?

250
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,737
Scott: What do you feel in a place where it's always dark?

251
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:16,010
Rym: Yeah, I think the real answer is it sucks to live in those places But I mean don't live in places with his natural disasters or weird shit.

252
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:21,090
Scott: I don't know why people consist on living in these places, you know I guess some of them their parents lived there because they were stupid.

253
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,649
Rym: So name a place that does not have significant disaster risk.

254
00:16:25,091 --> 00:16:26,336
Scott: I mean New York is mostly safe.

255
00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:30,412
Rym: New York got hit by Sandy and I could have really fucked up our Jimmy's way worse than It did.

256
00:16:30,452 --> 00:16:34,510
Scott: Yeah, but it's not like living in Dominican right where you're gonna get destroyed.

257
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:43,590
Rym: Yeah Well, like the minute you want the safest place to live is probably the Midwestern United States and like Ontario right there Cuz the only thing he's got to worry about in those places are tornadoes.

258
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:49,338
Rym: Tornadoes are very easily avoided in places like.

259
00:16:49,358 --> 00:16:54,530
Scott: there are many plays on earth that are relatively safe from earthquake or weather incidents.

260
00:16:55,692 --> 00:16:55,913
Scott: but

261
00:16:56,295 --> 00:17:12,890
Rym: anyway, the news here is that the Usually in the end in the US internet the complaint is daylight saving time sucks And then people don't understand how it actually works, but they all kind of agree that they don't want it to happen Even though most of the arguments they make for abolishing it I think are stupid arguments.

262
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,805
Scott: Yes, the only argument is that's the way the clock should be.

263
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:16,489
Scott: get deal with it.

264
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:17,910
Scott: Yeah I want to be out in the sunlight.

265
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:21,787
Rym: So the EU is going to stop changing the clocks next year.

266
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:27,567
Rym: good The EU is quote doing away with twice yearly clock changes and what their way they're gonna handle?

267
00:17:27,587 --> 00:17:28,329
Rym: it is very simple.

268
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:37,290
Rym: Every member state will get to itself decide however, it wants which of those times They're gonna move to and stay at forever.

269
00:17:37,511 --> 00:17:41,490
Scott: Rym is gonna be in high demand as every computer needs to make sure it's NTP.

270
00:17:42,892 --> 00:17:47,144
Rym: No, NTP has nothing to do with this because NTP sets your GMT clock.

271
00:17:47,184 --> 00:17:50,962
Rym: unless you really fucked up or using windows Everyone's still gonna fuck up something.

272
00:17:51,123 --> 00:17:53,473
Rym: Oh, yeah, they are because It's.

273
00:17:53,513 --> 00:18:02,729
Rym: the only difference is when I worked at a broker a long time ago We would fuck up daylight saving time in some way four times a year because the u.s.

274
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:03,110
Rym: Would move.

275
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:04,976
Rym: Then Europe would move.

276
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:06,181
Rym: then the u.s.

277
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:06,844
Rym: Would move back.

278
00:18:07,305 --> 00:18:08,390
Rym: then Europe would move back.

279
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,189
Scott: Wouldn't it take like one year to fix it?

280
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:14,754
Scott: And then the second year you'd fix the thing the weird bit you didn't know To be fucked up in surprising and novel ways.

281
00:18:14,774 --> 00:18:23,449
Scott: perhaps forever Time zones get ready to fuck up again.

282
00:18:24,132 --> 00:18:24,854
Rym: You know what I feel like.

283
00:18:24,914 --> 00:18:38,189
Rym: I feel like there's this nice curve of people who have not done a lot of coding think time zones are Difficult and then people who have done a little bit of coding think time zones are easy and then people who have been around the block Long enough realize that time zones are difficult again.

284
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:41,823
Scott: But what's that website that always has like the time news?

285
00:18:42,446 --> 00:18:46,695
Rym: Oh, yeah There's a couple of sites like that.

286
00:18:46,976 --> 00:18:47,297
Scott: there's also.

287
00:18:47,317 --> 00:18:52,458
Scott: there's one that's like obviously like the super boring like Open source.

288
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:54,209
Rym: Well, there's also NTP dot org.

289
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:56,389
Scott: No, no, what's the time news?

290
00:18:57,675 --> 00:19:12,187
Rym: anyway, I know I Care about this in such an abstract way that if in my work someone messed up time zones that is so far beyond what I care about that I'll let people who used to do the kind of jobs that I used to Do that do the jobs that I used to do deal with it.

291
00:19:13,554 --> 00:19:14,628
Rym: We'll see how this goes down.

292
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:19,465
Rym: But I suspect that people like me in a distant future meaning 2019 time and date calm.

293
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:22,476
Rym: I've been to that side.

294
00:19:22,556 --> 00:19:23,119
Scott: That's the one.

295
00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:25,588
Scott: Oh you push to scrap DST clock.

296
00:19:25,648 --> 00:19:27,414
Rym: Yep So here's what I think.

297
00:19:27,455 --> 00:19:29,622
Scott: he changes dates for daylight savings time.

298
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:31,970
Scott: Japan considers daylight saving time for Olympics.

299
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,570
Scott: Yeah, North Korea adapt South Korean time zone.

300
00:19:35,031 --> 00:19:41,350
Rym: So the funniest one I ever ran into was when a certain South American country Florida says yes to year-round daylight saving time.

301
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,897
Scott: Yeah, there's there's movement.

302
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,505
Scott: We might find that was this battle.

303
00:19:44,525 --> 00:19:45,530
Scott: That was in March of this year.

304
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,997
Rym: Yeah, we might finally win this battle.

305
00:19:47,017 --> 00:19:49,530
Scott: So time and date calm is a real good website.

306
00:19:49,751 --> 00:19:57,630
Rym: What'll be very interesting is to see which you EU member states Vote to go to the correct time versus the stupid baby time.

307
00:19:57,871 --> 00:20:00,390
Scott: Well, I think you're gonna see a difference in voting based on latitude.

308
00:20:00,591 --> 00:20:03,261
Rym: I think latitude I will give an allowance for latitude.

309
00:20:03,562 --> 00:20:07,649
Rym: if you live in a place that votes for stupid baby I'm gonna be like shit.

310
00:20:10,391 --> 00:20:13,422
Rym: So in some other news you might have seen this going on.

311
00:20:13,442 --> 00:20:16,702
Rym: Scott pointed out and we've been talking about this in the forum This is not new.

312
00:20:17,872 --> 00:20:21,504
Rym: It's more that a lot more people have realized it's happening.

313
00:20:21,564 --> 00:20:23,290
Scott: I think it's Americans have realized it's happening.

314
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:42,230
Rym: Yeah, but the broader problem the story here specifically is that people are spoofing music plays in Spotify to drive the charts which is extra problematic because The rate and which people play music is also used to determine how much money to give to artists, right?

315
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,909
Scott: So there's basically two layers of things going on here, right?

316
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:48,310
Scott: So it's mostly coming from Korea, but also other countries.

317
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:53,325
Scott: But Korea is like the heart of this right the kpop scene because you have these massive organized fandoms, right?

318
00:20:53,386 --> 00:21:03,769
Scott: So what happens is First you have the Korean people as a society At least from what I've seen on their television that I've paid more attention to than probably anyone listening to the show.

319
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:09,990
Scott: They are obsessed with charts and rankings like obsessed like they have that you go to like their home.

320
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:15,568
Scott: There's a website neighbor, which is like the Google of Korea and if you go there It's not just a home page with a search box.

321
00:21:16,111 --> 00:21:22,070
Scott: It's like all these stuff and they there's real-time search rankings and people care about those a lot.

322
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,636
Scott: They talk about them on TV.

323
00:21:23,697 --> 00:21:24,681
Scott: Like oh my god.

324
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:26,910
Scott: Did you see I was trending on the real-time search rankings?

325
00:21:27,792 --> 00:21:29,961
Scott: Right and they had like a party because of that and shit, right?

326
00:21:30,303 --> 00:21:37,450
Scott: So people are obsessed with the rankings there They have and this constantly news articles like oh such and such reputation ranking every month.

327
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:42,350
Scott: They're like ranking reputations of celebrities and how much brand value they have and all those ridiculous nonsense.

328
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:44,017
Scott: And there's like websites.

329
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:45,563
Scott: they're like real-time music charts.

330
00:21:45,924 --> 00:21:49,470
Scott: even music fans in the u.s Don't pay that much attention to Billboard music charts.

331
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,990
Scott: I feel like a little bit if you read way into it.

332
00:21:52,070 --> 00:22:00,206
Scott: But it's like you think metal fans paying attention like the metal music chart Band is on the chart, right?

333
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,845
Scott: But Koreans kpop fans they obsess about the chart.

334
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:10,110
Scott: it updates Hourly, right sometimes even more than that and it's like it matters a lot where you are in the chart.

335
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,890
Scott: They give up prizes on music shows four or five six times a week to people who are ranking high on charts.

336
00:22:15,112 --> 00:22:16,590
Scott: So they care a lot about charts.

337
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:20,210
Rym: So if you can manipulate the data that's driving the charts you manipulate the charts.

338
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:36,914
Scott: So fit on the level one you have the big fandoms these organized groups of teenagers who care about this more than anything Doing whatever they can to bump up their favorite people on the charts spending money spending time Organizing right.

339
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:56,137
Scott: and on the other layer you have actual record companies trying to Fake and get people their own artists up on the charts going to stores buying tons and tons of albums Right pulling dirty tricks like saying aha if you want to come to the handshake meeting you have to you know Buy X number of albums.

340
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:58,870
Scott: so fans go and buy a hundred albums and then they can go to that, right?

341
00:23:00,152 --> 00:23:02,359
Scott: And to get just to get themselves up on these?

342
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,810
Rym: there's a wide variety of adverse incentives in this.

343
00:23:06,432 --> 00:23:08,821
Scott: Record companies want to fake get up on the charts.

344
00:23:09,282 --> 00:23:14,990
Scott: the other record companies get whoever Legitimately popular get mad when someone else fakes themselves onto the charts.

345
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:21,349
Scott: well, the fans want to get their artists fakely up onto the charts and all alright and What this ends up happening?

346
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:30,350
Scott: it means is that someone who doesn't deserve it is getting more royalties and they're supposed to and it also Translates into other things like oh that group looks like a big deal now.

347
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:34,489
Scott: They are a big deal, but are they really as big a deal as you think?

348
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:44,350
Scott: BTS like the biggest thing in kpop right now Trends on Twitter and gets more likes and more retweets than literally anything else more than the president.

349
00:23:44,912 --> 00:23:49,427
Scott: No matter what crazy thing happens in the world news BTS gets more tweets more retweets.

350
00:23:49,447 --> 00:23:50,410
Scott: Their hashtag is bigger.

351
00:23:51,358 --> 00:23:52,589
Scott: Are they really that fucking big?

352
00:23:52,871 --> 00:23:57,170
Scott: They're real big but that big the biggest thing on earth the biggest thing on all of Twitter?

353
00:23:57,618 --> 00:23:58,126
Scott: I don't think so.

354
00:23:58,663 --> 00:24:10,283
Scott: Yeah right the fans are just so Organized and so passionate that they go crazy and make a ton of accounts and push real real hard in a way that no one Else is doing for anything else and this results in like.

355
00:24:10,363 --> 00:24:14,236
Scott: oh they get to appear on TV TV stars and start calling them.

356
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:14,878
Scott: It's like.

357
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:22,550
Scott: well if they knew how big they really were and it wasn't fake Hype would the TV stations really be calling them to appear on TV in the US?

358
00:24:23,197 --> 00:24:33,670
Scott: Now take the same But also also how many people became fans because the fake hype to reach them Right, which is what the original fans are trying to do, but here's the real problem.

359
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:46,350
Rym: So this this problem in and of itself is a problem, but take that incentive model and apply it to Modern streaming platforms that distribute revenue to artists based on these metrics.

360
00:24:46,511 --> 00:24:51,430
Rym: Yep, and now you've got a system that is ripe for direct abuse.

361
00:24:51,951 --> 00:25:09,897
Scott: It's basically, you know, you might have popular music and someone else might have popular music But if they're popular music has an active organized and engaged fan base that will pump you up artificially or we'll get more money per listener and Else will malware.

362
00:25:09,937 --> 00:25:13,290
Rym: that logs into people's Spotify accounts and just plays things on loop.

363
00:25:13,952 --> 00:25:20,132
Scott: There's lots of ways to find a way to make API calls to Spotify that say you played a song even though you didn't fucking Play anything.

364
00:25:20,313 --> 00:25:22,523
Scott: Yeah, you just tell Spotify you want to play this song.

365
00:25:22,543 --> 00:25:23,447
Scott: They start sending you bits.

366
00:25:23,467 --> 00:25:24,070
Scott: you ignore them.

367
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,886
Scott: You know you don't have to play them out of speaker and even if they piece of software that does this.

368
00:25:27,987 --> 00:25:41,090
Rym: even if this was 100% locked down and like you couldn't game the system directly You could still just install legit Spotify accounts like legit clients and just have farms playing music to dev null.

369
00:25:41,211 --> 00:25:52,430
Scott: there are supposedly places where they have like basically rooms and rooms and rooms of phones all lined up and they can Orchestrate all the phones to do the same thing and they have them all just like play the same song or visit the same site.

370
00:25:52,571 --> 00:25:55,230
Scott: Or do you know anything that you need done in mass?

371
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:58,329
Scott: They just got a room with thousands of phones in it and they'll do it for you.

372
00:25:58,911 --> 00:26:08,541
Rym: I guess it's interesting because you think that we know in the old era you'd have like Nielsen or like some organization doing surveys to figure out this is popular or that's popular.

373
00:26:08,941 --> 00:26:14,137
Rym: but monetization was separate because people would just sell albums, but now Monetization isn't so simple.

374
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,383
Rym: It's not just sell albums.

375
00:26:15,403 --> 00:26:19,182
Rym: That doesn't really work anywhere anymore Not in the long run definitely not in the US.

376
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:24,290
Rym: and then simultaneously - how do you track what is actually popular?

377
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,154
Rym: How do you track what people are listening to?

378
00:26:26,715 --> 00:26:30,845
Rym: even the direct clicks and the direct listens aren't actually a reliable metric.

379
00:26:30,865 --> 00:26:33,470
Rym: I Think this is good.

380
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:38,470
Rym: This is gonna be kind of like the advertising industry on the internet and that there aren't good solutions.

381
00:26:39,033 --> 00:26:42,810
Rym: And I think this entire industry is still ripe for a giant collapse.

382
00:26:43,172 --> 00:26:49,063
Scott: I think we should just make whenever there's an industry that's baking basing You know financial distributions on fake numbers.

383
00:26:49,084 --> 00:26:50,470
Rym: Should we game those numbers, right?

384
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,530
Scott: We should just make something and game the numbers to give ourselves a lot of money.

385
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:58,950
Rym: Why is the GeekNights podcast the number one pop album on Spotify, right?

386
00:27:00,131 --> 00:27:00,681
Scott: Why isn't it?

387
00:27:02,391 --> 00:27:14,130
Scott: and the thing is it becomes a self-fulfilling thing because they have Automatic algorithms that see that we're getting a lot of listens and then they boost us up and like positions on Playlists and then we get listens and it sort of falls in on itself.

388
00:27:14,311 --> 00:27:19,009
Rym: I mean, that's how the early rounds of like big YouTube celebrities can twitch celebrities came to be.

389
00:27:19,873 --> 00:27:27,310
Rym: You'd have a slight uptick in following and I'm in a slight uptick in engagements Which meant a slight uptick in more people seeing you which was a self-fulfilling prophecy.

390
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:32,393
Scott: there was one kpop artist who got onto the top of the chart and everyone was mad and they were like What the hell is this?

391
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:33,457
Scott: and the song was garbage.

392
00:27:33,537 --> 00:27:38,276
Scott: and then the person was like they wouldn't have a fan meeting Because like no one showed up.

393
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:46,996
Scott: Yeah, but then there's someone else new who's like suddenly it's like a no-name person no one ever heard of was like on the top of the chart now and Everyone's like what the hell is this?

394
00:27:47,277 --> 00:27:49,870
Scott: and I don't know if they faked themselves to get there in the first place.

395
00:27:50,232 --> 00:27:56,840
Scott: But they're still there and people were like, oh this song is actually good It's just because it was not a famous person.

396
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,365
Scott: Everyone was way hella suspicious.

397
00:27:58,706 --> 00:27:59,770
Rym: Well, it comes down to a quote here.

398
00:27:59,831 --> 00:28:01,007
Rym: That's pretty pretty sums it up.

399
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:05,333
Rym: But if a superfan decides to listen non-stop to a track Is that fake?

400
00:28:05,714 --> 00:28:05,955
Scott: is it?

401
00:28:06,256 --> 00:28:10,790
Rym: if so how many times do they have to listen to a track continuously before it is deemed fake?

402
00:28:11,131 --> 00:28:19,014
Scott: Spotify brings in X dollars in revenue and then divides it among all the musicians and songwriters based on how many you know listens Right.

403
00:28:19,296 --> 00:28:21,770
Scott: Should you really be getting more of that pie?

404
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:36,824
Scott: if you have a superfan then, you know, if I have a superfan and That metal band over there just as a regular fan who listens to their song once a day And I have a superfan who listens to my song on repeat day and night Do I really deserve more of the Spotify pie than that metal band does?

405
00:28:36,904 --> 00:28:38,349
Rym: it's the same problem in?

406
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,774
Rym: Counter-strike cheating.

407
00:28:40,235 --> 00:28:44,730
Rym: as if you're not cheating by using like an actual bot like cheating with the software.

408
00:28:45,732 --> 00:28:46,882
Scott: Both legitimately listening.

409
00:28:46,943 --> 00:28:47,730
Scott: forget the cheating part.

410
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:56,142
Rym: But I'm saying what's the difference between a human using a mouse and a keyboard is really good versus a computer Controlling a mouse and a keyboard with a webcam pointed at the screen.

411
00:28:56,644 --> 00:28:58,170
Rym: There's no way to differentiate those.

412
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:03,508
Scott: So the fonder lying metric is itself suspects, but I'm saying, you know, I'm not even talking about that.

413
00:29:03,528 --> 00:29:09,670
Scott: I'm talking about Why do you deserve more of the Spotify pie for having a superfan versus having a regular fan?

414
00:29:10,813 --> 00:29:11,519
Scott: Or do why is it?

415
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,750
Scott: Why should it be based on listens?

416
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:16,747
Scott: Why shouldn't it be based on number of fans or number of fans?

417
00:29:16,908 --> 00:29:19,937
Rym: I've got 10,000 accounts that all like me.

418
00:29:20,017 --> 00:29:21,982
Scott: I'm not talking about how you've determined it.

419
00:29:22,042 --> 00:29:24,950
Scott: I'm saying let's say let's pretend everything's legitimate, right?

420
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,077
Scott: There's no cheating technologically, right?

421
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:27,619
Scott: How much?

422
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,843
Scott: why do you deserve more?

423
00:29:28,903 --> 00:29:30,649
Scott: because you had a person listen to your song twice?

424
00:29:32,132 --> 00:29:33,336
Scott: Two people is near its -.

425
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:35,544
Scott: should you get more money if two people listen to your song once?

426
00:29:35,866 --> 00:29:38,338
Scott: then if one person listens twice That's the crux of it.

427
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:40,330
Rym: If this were just what is popular.

428
00:29:40,431 --> 00:29:47,970
Rym: It's a very different much lower stakes gambit But the fact that it is the primary driver for the metrics used for revenue distribution.

429
00:29:48,552 --> 00:29:53,210
Rym: The real problem is that we still don't have a sustainable monetization model for music.

430
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:57,084
Scott: We should I mean, can we even come up with a fair way to distribute the revenue?

431
00:29:57,104 --> 00:29:58,830
Scott: if no one's cheating, right?

432
00:29:59,472 --> 00:30:11,669
Rym: I think the fairway is some sort of system where perhaps a communist government allows people to have the luxury of creating music with their needs taken care of And we don't worry about monetizing it and how music is free.

433
00:30:11,991 --> 00:30:15,160
Rym: Yeah, I think that would work better than what we're doing now.

434
00:30:15,802 --> 00:30:18,350
Scott: anyone who is you register as a musician you get X dollars.

435
00:30:18,491 --> 00:30:33,519
Scott: Yeah, the end and I said and well and then if you be if you're popular You should be able to make money off endorsements and concerts monetize beyond the government minimum Mm-hmm, and if Everyone in America signs up for the government minimum It's probably not that much.

436
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:35,130
Rym: and if you're willing to live off that sure

437
00:30:35,893 --> 00:30:40,950
Scott: And everyone in the whole country signs up to be a musician just to get their piece of their even piece of that

438
00:30:41,431 --> 00:30:47,894
Rym: Ah, maybe you're maybe you're not allowed to have a non music source of income if you sign up for this Like you can't.

439
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:52,849
Rym: you can't just work for a company and also say I'm a musician give me my 20 grand.

440
00:30:53,471 --> 00:30:58,488
Rym: Anyway anyway in some other minor tech news that's actually worth mentioning.

441
00:30:58,548 --> 00:31:03,110
Rym: briefly Linus Torvalds anyone who's unaware has a reputation.

442
00:31:03,813 --> 00:31:06,484
Scott: No, he doesn't a reputation being a giant dick.

443
00:31:06,524 --> 00:31:08,030
Scott: No, here's our reputation being a giant dick.

444
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:08,976
Scott: He is a giant.

445
00:31:08,996 --> 00:31:13,982
Rym: Yeah, but he has a reputation for being a giant dick And that reputation is entirely grounded in reality.

446
00:31:14,022 --> 00:31:15,730
Rym: In fact, right that is demonstrable.

447
00:31:16,011 --> 00:31:17,857
Scott: He is the person who created the Linux kernel.

448
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:21,149
Scott: is objectively is that BS OD?

449
00:31:21,932 --> 00:31:23,077
Scott: Yep, right.

450
00:31:23,237 --> 00:31:24,844
Scott: He's like he is that asshole.

451
00:31:25,085 --> 00:31:35,761
Scott: Basically if you read his emails Basically, the thing he's known for is he's usually most of the time I'd say at least 80% Maybe even 90% of the time on the correct side of arguments.

452
00:31:35,841 --> 00:31:37,846
Scott: Yeah in terms of technology, right?

453
00:31:37,866 --> 00:31:38,889
Scott: I remember watching the.

454
00:31:40,211 --> 00:31:42,079
Scott: I'll never forget the one where he's talking about git.

455
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:46,073
Scott: He's like if you don't use git you are stupid Right.

456
00:31:46,113 --> 00:32:01,735
Scott: He's like argue Technologically correct git is way better and all the things he was saying was right and He's bashing all the other version control systems, but he was basically calling the whole audience morons stupid idiots Whatever.

457
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:04,706
Scott: It's like it's like Don't do that.

458
00:32:05,612 --> 00:32:09,505
Scott: So the new one who's stupid asshole just because you're technologically, right?

459
00:32:09,826 --> 00:32:11,010
Rym: This came to a head recently.

460
00:32:11,111 --> 00:32:15,643
Rym: I'm not gonna get into all the details after 20 plus years The night late 90s.

461
00:32:16,612 --> 00:32:20,270
Rym: But basically he did something that as far as I can tell he's never done is one.

462
00:32:20,671 --> 00:32:22,880
Rym: he issued a public apology for something specific.

463
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,844
Rym: that was shitty that he did.

464
00:32:24,386 --> 00:32:28,639
Rym: and then he issued a Planket apology for 20 to 30 years of assholiness.

465
00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:42,646
Rym: Yep But he's got a long way to go to make up for that true but what I will say that was very interesting is that this was One of the rare instances of an apology that was actually an apology his news.

466
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:44,372
Scott: because in 20 to 30 years It's like.

467
00:32:44,532 --> 00:32:50,700
Scott: it's weird because on the one hand one apology doesn't make up for that much assholishness But on the other hand, it's been 30 years.

468
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,447
Scott: He's never apologized for fucking anything.

469
00:32:52,487 --> 00:32:54,298
Scott: Yeah, it's weird It's like what it was really.

470
00:32:54,338 --> 00:32:55,325
Rym: it wasn't one of those like.

471
00:32:55,446 --> 00:32:57,297
Scott: I'm sorry I didn't even know if he knew the word.

472
00:32:57,357 --> 00:32:58,523
Rym: what sorry was a word.

473
00:32:58,744 --> 00:32:59,830
Rym: This was not one of those.

474
00:33:00,031 --> 00:33:00,917
Rym: I sorry you.

475
00:33:01,078 --> 00:33:02,950
Rym: I'm sorry you feel that way apologies.

476
00:33:03,452 --> 00:33:06,080
Rym: This is basically I fucked up.

477
00:33:06,241 --> 00:33:07,465
Rym: I've been shitty for a long time.

478
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:09,050
Scott: You've been shitty for a real long time.

479
00:33:09,951 --> 00:33:11,477
Rym: He even went further I know.

480
00:33:11,498 --> 00:33:22,170
Rym: he basically said that he knows apologizing doesn't fix any of it Of course not and it's basically the first step in him getting his shit together And he's gonna take some time off and get some help, right?

481
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:26,474
Scott: We'll see if he gets some help, but it's he needs a lot of help He does.

482
00:33:26,495 --> 00:33:28,724
Scott: how you gonna teach the oldest dog new tricks.

483
00:33:28,744 --> 00:33:32,944
Rym: I Mean maybe getting helpful also involve finally passing the torch.

484
00:33:33,366 --> 00:33:34,170
Scott: I don't know fashion.

485
00:33:34,737 --> 00:33:43,700
Rym: We'll see how this goes But it's it's notable because how this plays out will actually have long-standing ramifications for a lot of technology We all use.

486
00:33:44,004 --> 00:33:46,536
Rym: yeah Linus is very important.

487
00:33:46,637 --> 00:33:52,735
Scott: like this level of one person is going to affect all your Android Yep, in a way.

488
00:33:52,955 --> 00:33:58,409
Rym: There are very few people for whom an apology like this would be notable enough for us to talk about it.

489
00:34:00,433 --> 00:34:03,950
Scott: Can you think of any other incident where someone who's been like a lifelong asshole?

490
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:10,250
Rym: There's that learned a new leaders that one KK a guy the guy who was like, yeah, this is all bullshit.

491
00:34:10,451 --> 00:34:15,357
Scott: I'll always be a KKK a long time Mmm, we used his.

492
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:17,549
Rym: we used him as a thing of the day like a decade ago.

493
00:34:18,212 --> 00:34:19,237
Rym: Maybe remember that guy.

494
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,489
Scott: I mean this has been a few guys like that.

495
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,233
Rym: Yeah, but they're.

496
00:34:22,254 --> 00:34:23,277
Rym: they're gonna have too many.

497
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:35,118
Rym: not many but more than one But anyway things of the day.

498
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:37,065
Scott: so shit was my thing.

499
00:34:37,085 --> 00:34:38,370
Rym: I I got your thing today up here.

500
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,534
Rym: You don't remember what it was.

501
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:40,478
Scott: Oh, I do remember.

502
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:42,467
Rym: it was that it was the incident with the Mustang.

503
00:34:42,487 --> 00:34:43,030
Scott: I do remember.

504
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:51,956
Rym: So I thought this video is pretty recent and this is something where I'm curious Scott Do you know the origin of the word?

505
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:56,270
Scott: Okay, I feel like I've watched something about it at one point and then don't remember.

506
00:34:56,571 --> 00:34:58,437
Rym: Yeah, so I thought I knew like.

507
00:34:58,477 --> 00:35:02,679
Scott: I thought they feel like I've been told by a linguist and then do not remember what they Said.

508
00:35:02,805 --> 00:35:07,948
Rym: yeah So I thought I knew the answer and it was some military thing and I thought it stood for like some German phrase.

509
00:35:07,988 --> 00:35:12,607
Scott: and now I mean, I think I actually I think was an article that was talking about how why is it was like?

510
00:35:12,667 --> 00:35:13,370
Scott: why is okay?

511
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:14,833
Scott: So universal around the earth.

512
00:35:15,074 --> 00:35:20,610
Rym: No, it was something like that because Vox has a video that goes into pretty like really deep depth on it.

513
00:35:21,173 --> 00:35:27,404
Rym: Not only was the thing I thought I knew way wrong But the actual answer is so much better than I expected.

514
00:35:27,424 --> 00:35:29,150
Scott: You know that they're right and they're not making stuff up.

515
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:29,933
Rym: I'm confident.

516
00:35:29,953 --> 00:35:30,394
Rym: They're right.

517
00:35:30,414 --> 00:35:31,378
Rym: This is well research.

518
00:35:31,398 --> 00:35:31,900
Rym: Uh-huh.

519
00:35:32,241 --> 00:35:33,164
Rym: So you're welcome.

520
00:35:33,184 --> 00:35:34,730
Rym: You're welcome to debate with these people.

521
00:35:34,891 --> 00:35:35,978
Rym: Maybe they're wrong.

522
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:36,461
Scott: I don't know.

523
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:37,145
Scott: So here's the deal.

524
00:35:37,205 --> 00:35:37,608
Scott: How do I know?

525
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:39,032
Rym: Okay.

526
00:35:39,433 --> 00:35:45,250
Rym: Now it also the second half of this video gets into why it's such a universally used phrase.

527
00:35:45,316 --> 00:36:01,030
Rym: Yes Well, that's that's what I think I write about because that parts really important and that part basically it sounds the fact that is a neutral affirmative meaning it implies that you receive the information without Judging the information in any way or expressing any opinion on the information.

528
00:36:01,836 --> 00:36:09,233
Rym: So you say something and I say, okay It means I heard you but it does not imply that I give a shit or that I have an opinion and that's why it's So valuable.

529
00:36:09,575 --> 00:36:10,922
Rym: we didn't have a good way to do that.

530
00:36:10,942 --> 00:36:14,434
Rym: I guess affirmative Could be used in that way.

531
00:36:14,956 --> 00:36:16,923
Rym: But anyway, you can watch this video.

532
00:36:16,943 --> 00:36:36,735
Rym: But the gist of it is that meme Lords in the 1830s had a fad in Boston and the fad was that they would make up Acronyms for common phrases and then fuck the acronyms up so that they're wrong and then use the wrong Acronyms to be funny.

533
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,045
Rym: So they'd be like there are.

534
00:36:39,065 --> 00:36:51,073
Rym: there's a ton of examples Like people clever hipster dudes in like 1810 in Boston would be like KC and KC stands for enough said spelled really really badly Mm-hmm.

535
00:36:51,395 --> 00:36:59,889
Rym: So okay is all Correct all spelled OLL and correct spelled with a K because that's super wrong.

536
00:36:59,909 --> 00:37:03,700
Rym: and Hipsters in the 1820s thought this was really funny.

537
00:37:04,042 --> 00:37:11,810
Rym: and then there's this whole story of how that ended up becoming This widespread used word that's around the world in many and even non English languages today.

538
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:17,069
Rym: All right, so it came out of meme Lord hipsters in Boston in the early 1800s.

539
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:25,928
Scott: Okay So Here's a guy riding a bicycle getting run over by a Mustang and you're probably already over.

540
00:37:25,948 --> 00:37:27,515
Scott: you're smart You're a GeekNights listener.

541
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:31,974
Scott: You probably know it's gonna be a horse and not a car But that doesn't matter.

542
00:37:31,994 --> 00:37:32,656
Scott: I already could.

543
00:37:32,676 --> 00:37:36,830
Scott: I already caught that joke before watching the video as well as soon as it's not the headline.

544
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:37,934
Scott: I knew it was gonna be a horse.

545
00:37:38,195 --> 00:37:38,818
Scott: doesn't matter.

546
00:37:39,019 --> 00:37:39,360
Scott: It's funny.

547
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,063
Scott: Anyway, it is.

548
00:37:40,364 --> 00:37:41,830
Rym: it's pretty funny in the tape.

549
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:45,323
Rym: Watch the whole thing the exact amount of time it takes between you.

550
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:50,110
Rym: start the video and your brain thinks I'll bet this is and then the horse appears.

551
00:37:50,972 --> 00:37:52,561
Rym: Well, the horse is it doesn't matter.

552
00:37:52,582 --> 00:37:53,889
Scott: and this is I want to show again.

553
00:37:54,251 --> 00:37:57,924
Scott: This is proof to all those people argue with me spoilers don't ruin things.

554
00:37:58,566 --> 00:38:01,053
Rym: They do change the experience They do.

555
00:38:01,194 --> 00:38:01,897
Rym: are you disagreeing?

556
00:38:02,038 --> 00:38:02,560
Scott: I disagree.

557
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,103
Scott: you disagree.

558
00:38:03,123 --> 00:38:03,725
Scott: This is funny.

559
00:38:03,846 --> 00:38:08,854
Scott: whether or not you know It's a. if you don't and also if you don't know it's a horse Line you are.

560
00:38:09,357 --> 00:38:16,530
Scott: you need some some skills, okay In the moment we didn't do shows for like two weeks.

561
00:38:16,971 --> 00:38:21,830
Rym: But if you saw us at PAX and now you're ordered why the hell we're talking about like Linux and stuff?

562
00:38:22,212 --> 00:38:24,628
Rym: guess what GeekNights is four nights a week.

563
00:38:24,649 --> 00:38:27,090
Scott: and That doesn't mean we do four shows a week.

564
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:31,568
Rym: We used to when we were young and incredibly stupid and nothing better to do.

565
00:38:31,588 --> 00:38:34,164
Rym: now We have better things to do so we do two nights a week.

566
00:38:34,406 --> 00:38:37,200
Rym: So This week is a Monday Wednesday week.

567
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:43,530
Rym: So we're doing a Monday show on technology and on Wednesday We're gonna do a Wednesday show on anime and we're gonna review walk on girl.

568
00:38:43,871 --> 00:38:45,378
Rym: The night is short because that movie is.

569
00:38:45,398 --> 00:38:47,910
Scott: we can now think we should see some time a galaxy first.

570
00:38:48,031 --> 00:38:55,236
Rym: Oh, I only watch two episodes But I think I can review the movie at least in a vacuum and I got a lot to say about it having seen two Episodes time a galaxy.

571
00:38:55,296 --> 00:38:55,999
Scott: I don't know if you can.

572
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,310
Rym: well, it'll be good to have these your opinion?

573
00:38:58,412 --> 00:38:59,650
Scott: They're just watching the timing.

574
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:06,634
Rym: And then we actually have a backlog of multiple anime to review because we've also watched Mr.

575
00:39:06,695 --> 00:39:08,469
Rym: Tonegawa's middle management, whatever.

576
00:39:09,753 --> 00:39:24,716
Rym: And I've watched all of the new DuckTales Which you should watch because it's uh, I don't want to say my life to watch things here DuckTales, uh Remember how when we first got into ponies and we kind of really got into it DuckTales is like that.

577
00:39:24,897 --> 00:39:26,764
Rym: It's it's filled that void for me.

578
00:39:26,844 --> 00:39:27,406
Scott: No, it's good.

579
00:39:27,507 --> 00:39:29,615
Scott: It's Time do I have in my life?

580
00:39:29,816 --> 00:39:31,081
Rym: It's better than you expect.

581
00:39:31,422 --> 00:39:32,787
Scott: and also I don't have time.

582
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:36,445
Scott: like Scott I have seen him spends all the time sitting around watching TV.

583
00:39:36,747 --> 00:39:39,904
Rym: I have seen Every episode of Adventure Time.

584
00:39:40,507 --> 00:39:46,001
Rym: I know Literally everything that anyone who has watched this show could know.

585
00:39:46,021 --> 00:39:50,232
Rym: I know as many answers as you could possibly read all the Adventure Time comics.

586
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:54,025
Rym: I have not but they are ostensibly not canonical to this.

587
00:39:54,487 --> 00:39:56,418
Scott: I don't know doesn't matter I own a bunch of them.

588
00:39:56,539 --> 00:39:57,649
Scott: Yeah, they're really good.

589
00:39:58,252 --> 00:40:02,306
Rym: But the show ended and all I'm gonna say cuz we'll eventually talk about this.

590
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:03,270
Scott: It is a very good show.

591
00:40:03,452 --> 00:40:05,109
Rym: I feel like I'm gonna watch the entire show again.

592
00:40:05,431 --> 00:40:05,913
Scott: I'm gonna.

593
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:07,078
Scott: I think I might have to watch the show again.

594
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:15,530
Rym: Do not watch the end unless you have seen Literally every other episode of Adventure Time because it does tie everything up.

595
00:40:16,592 --> 00:40:19,130
Rym: Well, I think it is literally a perfect ending.

596
00:40:19,231 --> 00:40:20,782
Rym: I could not have asked for more and I love.

597
00:40:20,802 --> 00:40:21,809
Scott: how long is this ending?

598
00:40:22,471 --> 00:40:23,797
Scott: Adventure time episodes are short.

599
00:40:24,138 --> 00:40:25,183
Rym: It's long enough.

600
00:40:25,525 --> 00:40:30,290
Scott: Okay it I Don't even want to say anything about it other than that movie also.

601
00:40:30,651 --> 00:40:33,902
Rym: Yeah, but the movie will not impact the end of the show.

602
00:40:33,982 --> 00:40:37,814
Scott: my boy Prisma at the end, uh How about cosmic album?

603
00:40:37,854 --> 00:40:40,320
Rym: Oh, yeah, they're they're they're involved.

604
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:40,841
Scott: That's good.

605
00:40:41,162 --> 00:40:42,446
Scott: How about glob my boy?

606
00:40:42,466 --> 00:40:44,170
Rym: Oh, yeah glob is involved.

607
00:40:44,351 --> 00:40:44,773
Scott: Oh, baby.

608
00:40:44,974 --> 00:40:46,563
Scott: Also, give me that glob.

609
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:47,870
Scott: All I'm gonna say is we're not.

610
00:40:49,502 --> 00:40:52,715
Rym: Yes Magic man's magic is involved.

611
00:40:52,936 --> 00:40:53,658
Scott: It sounds like magic.

612
00:40:53,678 --> 00:40:55,122
Scott: man's magic is heavily involved.

613
00:40:55,543 --> 00:40:58,030
Rym: Uh, the lich like everything is involved.

614
00:40:58,512 --> 00:41:00,879
Rym: Everything comes to an appropriate ending.

615
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:02,986
Rym: It's real real good.

616
00:41:03,006 --> 00:41:04,090
Scott: lobbers lit showdown.

617
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:04,531
Scott: Let's go.

618
00:41:04,811 --> 00:41:09,579
Rym: Well, you might remember cuz glob was one of many entities out there in space.

619
00:41:09,939 --> 00:41:13,928
Scott: remember gold No Watch adventure time again.

620
00:41:14,331 --> 00:41:18,708
Rym: There's a moment that I remembered very much where the lich says something.

621
00:41:18,749 --> 00:41:20,033
Rym: the lich Has a few.

622
00:41:20,374 --> 00:41:25,710
Rym: every time the lich appeared he got like a couple of sentences that were said really well with a good voice actor.

623
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:26,594
Rym: That are really really good.

624
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:33,946
Rym: So one of those times the lich says something like, you know I am death the last scholar of gall, etc, etc.

625
00:41:35,612 --> 00:41:37,036
Rym: It all comes together in the end.

626
00:41:37,056 --> 00:41:43,112
Rym: I don't remember that but I remember that matters when it when when I saw what was going On at the end.

627
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:45,200
Rym: I was that person sitting here pointing the screen going.

628
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,206
Rym: Oh, oh, I see it.

629
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:52,409
Rym: It was super good Mm-hmm, so we'll be reviewing a lot of shows queued up and a lot of stuff to do.

630
00:41:52,891 --> 00:42:11,630
Rym: So if you saw us at PAX and you only want to hear about games next Tuesday, we're talking about games and also our panel you might have seen us at PAX is not on YouTube yet because The exact same panel with almost the exact same content that we did at PAX East is already on YouTube.

631
00:42:12,114 --> 00:42:14,221
Rym: It didn't actually have to go to the panel Mm-hmm.

632
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:23,550
Rym: If you saw streamed if you found GeekNights Because you saw the live stream of our panel from PAX West on PAX to let me know I'm curious.

633
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:23,992
Rym: I saw.

634
00:42:24,032 --> 00:42:32,790
Rym: apparently we had like between two and three hundred people watching it live on Twitch and I don't know how many people watch it after the fact because it's a GeekNights lecture.

635
00:42:32,871 --> 00:42:37,348
Rym: That's not on my personal YouTube channel So I don't have the stats for it.

636
00:42:37,772 --> 00:42:46,490
Rym: But I'm curious if you found us because of that twitch stream because if you did I am inclined to try to get more of our panels on the PAX twitch stream as opposed to just in a panel room.

637
00:42:47,755 --> 00:42:54,865
Rym: So yeah, otherwise the book club book is Still Homer's Odyssey because God didn't update the website.

638
00:42:55,427 --> 00:43:00,918
Scott: Oh it is Space Odyssey, it's another Odyssey.

639
00:43:01,098 --> 00:43:01,480
Scott: That's right.

640
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:01,982
Scott: These fake.

641
00:43:02,002 --> 00:43:04,150
Scott: we went from the Greek Odyssey to the Space Odyssey.

642
00:43:04,451 --> 00:43:04,813
Scott: You know what?

643
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:07,163
Scott: I'm reading books and I'm not reading that one.

644
00:43:07,183 --> 00:43:08,590
Scott: I'm reading other super fantasy novels.

645
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:15,087
Rym: The problem is I just all I want to do is read a bunch of our NK jemisin stuff.

646
00:43:15,469 --> 00:43:16,815
Scott: go ahead I'm ready.

647
00:43:16,876 --> 00:43:18,304
Scott: I'm reading some garbage old fantasy.

648
00:43:18,324 --> 00:43:21,073
Rym: No, ooh, I Will see.

649
00:43:21,093 --> 00:43:29,816
Rym: because if depending on once we do 2001 a Space Odyssey in the GeekNights book club I feel like I might do another Odyssey adjacent book.

650
00:43:29,856 --> 00:43:31,344
Rym: that is really really potentially.

651
00:43:31,384 --> 00:43:32,489
Scott: what are the Odysseys are there?

652
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,238
Rym: It's adjacent and that it's based on some Greek stuff.

653
00:43:36,258 --> 00:43:42,604
Rym: that's adjacent to the Odyssey, but it is technically a planescape book by Troy Denning.

654
00:43:44,212 --> 00:43:47,883
Rym: So we'll say a Plains Odyssey, yeah possibly it is Theseus.

655
00:43:47,943 --> 00:43:52,036
Rym: my boy is involved ship of Theseus the ship of Theseus.

656
00:43:52,537 --> 00:43:59,489
Rym: Theseus is involved in in the most Tangential way and only if you really read into it.

657
00:44:00,172 --> 00:44:05,770
Rym: But it is involved because it actually gets into a lot about like what is memory and what is a person and is a person?

658
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:08,319
Rym: Nothing more than the sum of their memories, etc, etc.

659
00:44:09,102 --> 00:44:11,290
Rym: I remember it being pretty but anyway, that's not the booklet book.

660
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:14,107
Rym: The booklet book is the 2001 Space Odyssey the real one.

661
00:44:14,308 --> 00:44:32,350
Rym: Yes so for the entire run of GeekNights since 2005 a perennial theme has been That we're really mad about copyright law Mm-hmm, and we want to reform it radically while still because we were baked in the in the maybe early 2000 slash that we grew up.

662
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:41,600
Rym: But we all not only that but we also came of age during what might have been Literally the golden age of modern piracy.

663
00:44:41,761 --> 00:44:51,849
Rym: Yes, like I don't think you young listeners today Who are younger than some of my Final Fantasy 1 save games realize the extent to which?

664
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:55,955
Rym: pirating media and software Shaped my young life.

665
00:44:56,256 --> 00:44:56,417
Rym: Mm-hmm.

666
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:58,203
Rym: Like that was a fucking era.

667
00:44:58,364 --> 00:44:59,467
Scott: I think young people these days.

668
00:44:59,528 --> 00:45:00,270
Scott: I think they don't pirate.

669
00:45:00,351 --> 00:45:01,750
Scott: They all got like mobile phones.

670
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:08,270
Rym: They don't really, you know about they do but what I've found is that they usually pirate in a really bad way.

671
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:15,690
Rym: they pirate software by downloading malware and They pirate media by watching fucked up like color.

672
00:45:16,374 --> 00:45:18,550
Scott: They'll go don't like they but they won't even realize they're pirating.

673
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:29,650
Rym: They'll go like a website with manga and not realize that it's an illegal manga site or they'll watch these YouTube videos Better like zoomed in cropped squash and there's reverb added to the audio.

674
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:32,590
Rym: That's pitch shifted to avoid all the content filters, right?

675
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,401
Rym: It's like watch like all of adventure time like people.

676
00:45:35,421 --> 00:45:42,828
Scott: you have these people buying the Nintendo online Service or people buying the stupid portable like that mini Nintendo or the mini Super Nintendo.

677
00:45:42,848 --> 00:45:44,474
Scott: It's like bro I got ROM of.

678
00:45:44,495 --> 00:45:56,261
Scott: I have every NES SNES Genesis Gameboy fucking every fucking game 100% of them there isn't even the Japanese ones.

679
00:45:56,341 --> 00:45:57,806
Scott: I have all the games ever.

680
00:45:58,067 --> 00:45:58,930
Scott: it cost me nothing.

681
00:45:59,231 --> 00:46:02,906
Scott: I can play them on my computer or even allow my DS lite, right?

682
00:46:03,187 --> 00:46:03,810
Scott: I paid nothing.

683
00:46:04,111 --> 00:46:08,725
Scott: Why the hell you paying and waiting in line to pay who knows what the fucking tiny NES cost?

684
00:46:08,745 --> 00:46:10,270
Scott: that is 20 goddamn games on.

685
00:46:10,451 --> 00:46:11,756
Scott: It's fucking useless piece of garbage.

686
00:46:11,897 --> 00:46:12,399
Scott: Yeah, right.

687
00:46:12,419 --> 00:46:17,669
Scott: What the hell's wrong with you adding another box under your TV Even if it's a tiny one, I don't understand what these people wrong with them.

688
00:46:18,193 --> 00:46:19,561
Rym: Now the important thing is that I don't.

689
00:46:19,581 --> 00:46:20,628
Scott: we don't want is piracy.

690
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:23,161
Rym: Yeah Yeah, but also times change.

691
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:25,532
Rym: like during that era it was also.

692
00:46:25,632 --> 00:46:45,549
Rym: piracy felt very different partly because it was easy to spin a narrative of like the people trying to free music from the RIAA and simultaneously the RIAA was being Overly draconian and what didn't really have the artists interest at heart so much as its own and there's a whole giant history of this

693
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:47,350
Scott: Doesn't matter.

694
00:46:47,477 --> 00:47:03,310
Rym: Yeah the point is that one of the common themes of this was that For every shitty thing that the US would do in terms of Throwing the baby out with a bathwater and trying to quash piracy Europe would always go above and beyond and do something way worse.

695
00:47:04,846 --> 00:47:07,589
Rym: and It's that this is continued to this day.

696
00:47:08,211 --> 00:47:24,190
Rym: But now we're in an interesting situation because on one hand I don't trust the US to regulate free speech on the internet Right because our government is in disarray But still the US does it better than even the countries that do everything else better.

697
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:25,090
Scott: Here's the problem, right?

698
00:47:25,291 --> 00:47:36,091
Scott: It's like a we believe in free speech and that the government should not regulate speech But also we believe that private companies shouldn't kick all the Nazis off because you're allowed to yep You're.

699
00:47:36,454 --> 00:47:37,501
Scott: it's not the government doing it.

700
00:47:37,542 --> 00:47:38,650
Scott: So it's not censorship, right?

701
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:44,830
Rym: So I'd also be okay with the government saying all speech is free except this narrow band of Nazis.

702
00:47:45,414 --> 00:47:47,750
Scott: Yeah that you know it's not perfect.

703
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:52,190
Rym: I would not have been for that if I were not for the fact that Nazism is on their eyes again.

704
00:47:52,551 --> 00:48:11,366
Scott: But anyway, the point is is that you know, we believe in things like, you know, like privacy and you know Whatnot, but then what happens is that when you take when you try to actually make laws that enforce those things and you know Encode those things you end up reaching too far and destroying the internet.

705
00:48:11,386 --> 00:48:16,970
Scott: and it's like no Right, we have to do what we can for those things without destroying the internet.

706
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:17,913
Scott: Yep, right.

707
00:48:18,113 --> 00:48:31,537
Scott: The internet is amazing because it allows the free flow of information around the entire world right, and it's like people keep trying to do things like get rid of net neutrality and You know regulate speech on the internet.

708
00:48:31,718 --> 00:48:34,326
Scott: It's like Internet's no good in China, right?

709
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:35,209
Scott: What the fuck?

710
00:48:35,249 --> 00:48:35,590
Scott: It's useless.

711
00:48:35,692 --> 00:48:36,486
Scott: Well, it's barely good.

712
00:48:36,527 --> 00:48:47,244
Rym: here There's this tweet that always sticks out in my head where someone said someone expressed all my myriad concerns about the web very succinctly and all They said was I feel like there used to be more websites.

713
00:48:47,526 --> 00:48:48,550
Scott: There did used to be more.

714
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:53,550
Rym: Yeah, like my Tenchi Muyo fan site or the Anna what Anna Pike web ring stuff?

715
00:48:54,124 --> 00:48:55,807
Scott: Yep Now it's just that's just someone's tumblr.

716
00:48:55,847 --> 00:48:57,979
Scott: now But I'm not gonna get there's only one website.

717
00:48:57,999 --> 00:49:00,290
Rym: tell them the full details of what the EU is doing.

718
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:05,030
Rym: But basically there's two parts to this directive and I'm not a lawyer and this is a naive reading.

719
00:49:05,814 --> 00:49:08,888
Scott: Tell you that the people who are in the media industries, right?

720
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:13,589
Scott: You know foolishly believe that this is gonna make them more monies.

721
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:19,573
Scott: So they're very happy about it because they don't really give it, you know, it's not their priority to not break the internet They just want.

722
00:49:19,714 --> 00:49:20,217
Scott: they're just thinking.

723
00:49:20,277 --> 00:49:22,610
Scott: Oh, yeah, I make I make movies I get more monies.

724
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:28,320
Rym: So one part of this is the link tax and it has to do with like news aggregators Don't even want to talk about that one.

725
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,690
Rym: That's a whole different ballgame, right?

726
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:32,510
Scott: It's like basically the link tags would be on paper real bad.

727
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,342
Scott: Like oh you want to link to this news article.

728
00:49:34,362 --> 00:49:35,510
Scott: you better pay us a bunch of money.

729
00:49:35,812 --> 00:49:39,210
Scott: But they put in a bunch of exceptions for all sorts of common sense things.

730
00:49:39,511 --> 00:49:44,790
Rym: So there's a lot like a link in and of itself doesn't seem to cover it but a link plus too big of a snippet Counts, right?

731
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:55,857
Scott: so basically that they put all sorts of common sense exceptions to read on to pay the tax and it's unforeseen whether this is actually gonna be a problem or not and We're gonna have to sort of wait and see.

732
00:49:56,138 --> 00:49:58,870
Scott: but it's kind of vague and it's not great and they shouldn't have done it.

733
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:03,870
Rym: But whatever and I can also see a lot of companies just serving a different website to the EU.

734
00:50:05,631 --> 00:50:06,232
Rym: That's happened before.

735
00:50:06,252 --> 00:50:12,490
Rym: there's already a bunch of game companies that just don't provide their forums or support anymore to anyone in Europe.

736
00:50:12,972 --> 00:50:18,858
Rym: Mmm, like there's there are numerous game companies or if you go to their website from Europe It just says sorry GDPR can't help.

737
00:50:18,919 --> 00:50:20,445
Scott: I don't have any cookie warnings on our site.

738
00:50:20,465 --> 00:50:21,570
Scott: Should I block everyone in Europe?

739
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:23,607
Rym: Yeah, I just don't care.

740
00:50:25,233 --> 00:50:26,156
Scott: Someone come after us.

741
00:50:26,237 --> 00:50:29,007
Rym: article 13 is the problem the so-called upload filter.

742
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:43,530
Rym: now the problem is that basically what they want to do is require big aggregators like YouTube and whatever to Pre vet uploaded content and prevent the upload of copyright infringing content.

743
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:43,932
Scott: All right.

744
00:50:43,952 --> 00:50:47,126
Scott: So how is this humanly possible for everybody?

745
00:50:47,407 --> 00:50:50,350
Scott: Yeah case in point You know how much video is uploaded to just YouTube?

746
00:50:50,792 --> 00:50:54,650
Scott: More in one second more video is uploaded to YouTube than you could watch in your whole life.

747
00:50:54,971 --> 00:51:24,550
Rym: So my problem is specifically the only thing I want to get into is the idea of upload filters as opposed to post-hoc filters because an upload filter cannot differentiate between Someone who has overused clips and pirated in some way versus someone who is using clips fair use for another purpose a derivative work of some kind commentary etc, or Specifically fair use for parody or news reporting.

748
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:32,930
Rym: there's no way to differentiate between those in a meaningful way because if there was we'd already see that technology being used things like YouTube

749
00:51:34,434 --> 00:51:48,017
Scott: Upload filter and simply you upload it, but then you just it doesn't get published on YouTube until Someone takes a look at it first because right now you upload a video on YouTube It just goes live right away And then you get a copyright takedown.

750
00:51:48,157 --> 00:51:51,990
Scott: the system comes in a timing right instead which I think is better.

751
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:54,110
Scott: Instead you upload your video to YouTube.

752
00:51:54,231 --> 00:51:58,028
Scott: You can't push the publish button until you've gone through the Yelp system.

753
00:51:58,088 --> 00:52:09,810
Rym: the problem There is maybe a different system than it is now But I think the big difference is that I can upload anything and it's live Until someone takes a positive action or as a rule that triggers and then I have to go through a process.

754
00:52:10,593 --> 00:52:13,750
Rym: The real problem in my opinion is that unlike the US?

755
00:52:14,353 --> 00:52:18,130
Scott: Where we have didn't even have fair use over there, that's the problem.

756
00:52:19,012 --> 00:52:29,879
Rym: Every European member state has different rules about this shit Mm-hmm And I don't think there's any reasonable way for a large company or a small company or really anyone To deal with all those different parts.

757
00:52:29,959 --> 00:52:32,410
Rym: like UK's libel laws are ridiculous.

758
00:52:32,872 --> 00:52:37,610
Rym: Every member state in the EU is all these different fair use ideas if they even have the concept of fair use.

759
00:52:38,396 --> 00:52:46,169
Rym: The US has a pretty good system But even that is not very well defined and ends up coming down to court cases more often than it should.

760
00:52:46,189 --> 00:52:53,023
Rym: and I feel like There's like people are saying that these the kinds of upload filters and laws.

761
00:52:53,364 --> 00:53:02,300
Rym: the result would be ending memes Like but not memes like actual memes, but memes like those funny Images and macros that we post everywhere.

762
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:18,750
Rym: I feel like it kind of could I feel like Preventing people from uploading or publishing on all these platforms in Europe with this prior restraint because remember US Copyright law makes a big deal about the difference between prior restraint versus post publication action?

763
00:53:19,011 --> 00:53:26,150
Scott: Well, the fundamental the way the reason all this problem started to begin with right is because they took away everyone's IP addresses.

764
00:53:26,651 --> 00:53:29,299
Scott: It used to be back in the days, right?

765
00:53:29,379 --> 00:53:30,221
Scott: You had a computer.

766
00:53:30,663 --> 00:53:33,210
Scott: you could just host things from your own goddamn computer.

767
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:35,983
Scott: You had as much upload as you had download, right?

768
00:53:36,224 --> 00:53:37,509
Scott: You didn't need right now a day.

769
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:39,804
Rym: Yes, I did most uploads that did download on my 3036 modem.

770
00:53:40,811 --> 00:53:42,236
Scott: I'm just saying right.

771
00:53:42,437 --> 00:53:45,047
Scott: people had an eye an actual IP address.

772
00:53:45,067 --> 00:53:45,750
Scott: They weren't netted.

773
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:47,096
Scott: They didn't have some dynamic address.

774
00:53:47,116 --> 00:53:47,839
Scott: that was changing.

775
00:53:48,261 --> 00:53:48,904
Scott: right you guys.

776
00:53:49,024 --> 00:53:50,350
Scott: you didn't need to have a web host.

777
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:53,445
Scott: You just run services on a computer in your house, right?

778
00:53:53,465 --> 00:53:54,590
Scott: You didn't need to use YouTube.

779
00:53:54,811 --> 00:53:58,565
Scott: You just put videos on a computer in your house and deliver them to the world, right?

780
00:53:58,585 --> 00:54:10,900
Scott: We're using peer-to-peer Sharing software like Napster and hotline and all these other things which surely though like this bottom sending your sending data Directly from our computers to our friends computers, right?

781
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:17,758
Scott: The reason that this sort of control can even be enforced is because Technologically speaking on the IP level right?

782
00:54:17,798 --> 00:54:22,090
Scott: We've created an internet right where you can't just host things in your house anymore.

783
00:54:22,431 --> 00:54:23,755
Scott: You don't have enough upload bandwidth.

784
00:54:23,775 --> 00:54:24,719
Scott: You're not given an IP.

785
00:54:24,739 --> 00:54:25,501
Scott: that doesn't change.

786
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:28,190
Scott: We're not using ipv6 yet everywhere, right?

787
00:54:28,412 --> 00:54:34,350
Scott: So if you want to have a video that's sent to the whole world You can't just upload it from your house directly to the people watching.

788
00:54:34,731 --> 00:54:39,670
Scott: You need to stream it to twitch who then streams of the people watching or upload it to YouTube who then send to be watching.

789
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:44,310
Scott: And that creates this bottleneck this single point where these kinds of things can be enforced.

790
00:54:44,912 --> 00:54:54,708
Scott: right if we go and fix the internet and let everyone have IP addresses again and go to ipv6 and Upload bandwidth right it just turns into another weird shitty old Wild Wild West.

791
00:54:54,748 --> 00:54:59,910
Scott: in some ways We can bring back the Napster glory days that what you just referred to as a Golden Age and there.

792
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,114
Scott: well We don't need a fucking YouTube.

793
00:55:01,134 --> 00:55:08,858
Scott: You can just go to Scott dot whatever and let's see them enforce their copyright regime against 10,000 million youtubes because everyone's got their own.

794
00:55:09,018 --> 00:55:11,024
Rym: I think a much more modern approach.

795
00:55:11,044 --> 00:55:13,410
Scott: everyone runs their own YouTube Scott tube Rym tube.

796
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:14,974
Scott: Let's see them fucking I do.

797
00:55:15,055 --> 00:55:18,424
Rym: I do want there to be a more distributed model like the old internet.

798
00:55:18,464 --> 00:55:18,985
Scott: deal with it.

799
00:55:19,286 --> 00:55:28,621
Rym: I simultaneously want massive copyright reform to Specifically protect fair use and parody because Piracy it piracy.

800
00:55:28,641 --> 00:55:34,080
Rym: if piracy disappeared Entirely without any other side effects.

801
00:55:34,602 --> 00:55:36,186
Rym: I wouldn't be that angry.

802
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:45,530
Rym: the problem is Piracy cannot be cannot in my opinion be quashed without severely limiting many other things that are not piracy.

803
00:55:45,952 --> 00:55:47,662
Rym: There's very little way to disentangle them.

804
00:55:47,762 --> 00:55:52,981
Scott: well all this stuff is like you know Saying the same thing since the beginning even before GeekNights, right?

805
00:55:53,001 --> 00:56:01,346
Scott: Yeah, because we don't like the laws of thermodynamics let's make a law that says we can we can get more energy out of the system than we put in.

806
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:05,389
Scott: that's not gonna make a Perpetual motion machine that suddenly works, right?

807
00:56:07,794 --> 00:56:08,617
Scott: That we could have we.

808
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:11,570
Scott: we could enforce copyright and have privacy.

809
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:18,696
Scott: But you know what the reality of the world is that once something becomes digital data it can be copied and distributed Infinitely for almost free.

810
00:56:18,937 --> 00:56:22,150
Scott: there is no way you can stop that from happening no matter what law you write.

811
00:56:22,452 --> 00:56:27,720
Scott: You might be able to catch some people who do it and punish them but you can't stop from happening no matter how much you want to.

812
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:31,595
Scott: so instead of trying to stop it or Punish people for doing it.

813
00:56:31,976 --> 00:56:35,930
Scott: You should instead just create a society where you accept that as reality.

814
00:56:36,251 --> 00:56:41,810
Scott: You just same way we accept that we can't have a perpetual motion machine, and we instead have an energy policy.

815
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:47,750
Scott: Here's the fun copyright policy that accepts the fact that you can't that that's the law of the universe.

816
00:56:48,012 --> 00:56:50,870
Rym: Yes, but that copyright policy cannot exist in a vacuum.

817
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:56,566
Rym: It also needs an economic restructuring so that the creation of art is still funded somehow.

818
00:56:56,807 --> 00:56:59,299
Scott: I'm sure But that doesn't think.

819
00:56:59,339 --> 00:57:00,526
Rym: well, that's the easy part.

820
00:57:00,727 --> 00:57:02,519
Scott: No, we're done You know you.

821
00:57:02,539 --> 00:57:07,200
Scott: just the point is no matter what it is You just have to accept reality instead of fighting against reality.

822
00:57:07,621 --> 00:57:12,437
Scott: and this is a fight against reality and it's also You know it They didn't destroy the Internet.

823
00:57:14,532 --> 00:57:42,469
Rym: I would not be nearly as potentially worried about this were it not for the fact that at least based on what I've read so far and just The EU's and Europe's history with this kind of thing I do worry that this will significantly curtail Parity and fair use rights globally and will edge us toward Using European standards for this as opposed to US standards because as shitty as US standards Are I think US standards of fair use are still the best we've got?

824
00:57:44,231 --> 00:57:56,980
Rym: And we're just gonna stop now cuz we're back GeekNights back, and I'm real hungry, and I'm gonna do another show in a couple days This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

825
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:01,896
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

830
00:58:37,557 --> 00:58:38,258
Rym: It's been a while.

831
00:58:38,278 --> 00:58:39,299
Rym: I apologize for that.

832
00:58:39,319 --> 00:58:46,980

Rym: Finn Christmas gift handle Redmond Sean Klein Chris Reimer and Thomas Hahn.

838
00:59:16,442 --> 00:59:22,120
Rym: Yeah, we missed two weeks of shows because of you know real life stuff, but we are picking up the content again.

839
00:59:22,581 --> 00:59:24,366
Rym: We're planning all new panels.

840
00:59:24,406 --> 00:59:29,460
Rym: Hopefully for PAX Unplugged and PAX South the patreon special rewards.

841
00:59:29,863 --> 00:59:31,353
Rym: We're gonna do the QA's again soon.

842
00:59:31,393 --> 00:59:32,340
Rym: We're ramping that back up.

843
00:59:32,561 --> 00:59:35,738
Rym: I have a better system from what we did before so stay tuned for that.

844
00:59:37,242 --> 00:59:42,455
Rym: If any of you are patrons of the page around and haven't clicked on it in a while I did post a special video.

845
00:59:42,476 --> 00:59:43,079
Rym: That was only.

846
00:59:43,921 --> 00:59:56,361
Rym: the only people who can see this video are people who either saw our panel at PAX West or Can click on that link in the patreon, but it's the pre-show pop-up video loop that we played in the room while the crowd was Loading.

847
00:59:57,324 --> 00:59:58,087
Rym: but stay tuned for.

848
00:59:58,127 --> 00:59:59,532
Rym: nor more Rym's rants.

849
00:59:59,913 --> 01:00:01,860
Rym: stay tuned for more rimbly reviews.

850
01:00:02,503 --> 01:00:06,260
Rym: Emily and I are gonna start reviewing every Disney animated feature in chronological order.

851
01:00:06,601 --> 01:00:11,120
Rym: There's a bunch of stuff coming mostly because it's gonna start getting cold enough a lot more time.

852
01:00:11,501 --> 01:00:14,552
Rym: I'm not out biking and running and going to cons and doing nonsense.

853
01:00:14,873 --> 01:00:22,635
Rym: So now I leave you all With all right professor Stevens consider me handling the situation in the meantime.

854
01:00:23,116 --> 01:00:24,560
Rym: Just stay here and rest.

855
01:00:25,464 --> 01:00:31,633
Scott: Please hurry, mr Tracker the radioactive power in that meteor is the key to my new life-saving technique.

856
01:00:31,854 --> 01:00:34,160
Scott: the wrong people could use it for destruction.

857
01:00:34,787 --> 01:00:34,889
Rym: Not.

858
01:00:34,929 --> 01:00:35,516
Rym: if I can help it.

859
01:00:37,744 --> 01:00:39,158
Rym: Give me the best agents for this mission.

860
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:41,585
Rym: We did it partner.

861
01:00:42,147 --> 01:00:46,685
Rym: Why don't you all bring in the last piece of that old meteor and we'll fix up Hondo Good as new.

862
01:00:47,208 --> 01:00:48,113
Rym: I don't have it dusty.

863
01:00:48,717 --> 01:00:49,180
Rym: I failed.

864
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,418
Scott: Hey anyone want a meteor?

865
01:00:58,542 --> 01:00:59,847
Scott: It was stashed in a truck.

866
01:00:59,887 --> 01:01:01,031
Scott: me and T-bob took.

867
01:01:01,433 --> 01:01:03,380
Rym: I don't know whether to hug you or spank you.
