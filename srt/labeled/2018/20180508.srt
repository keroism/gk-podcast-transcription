1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,380
Rym: It's Tuesday, May 8th, 2018.

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,583
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,623 --> 00:00:14,790
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,332 --> 00:00:25,316
Rym: Battle tech the video game the new one Not any of the old battle taking 20 80 not the one on the SNES We'll use on that warrior.

5
00:00:25,657 --> 00:00:28,570
Scott: people use years to tell different things apart that have the same name.

6
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,755
Rym: Yeah, I do that in the time.

7
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:31,843
Scott: When has there ever been like a doom?

8
00:00:31,924 --> 00:00:40,022
Scott: and then the same year also do Call Right, or they might be like doom video game and do board game.

9
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,109
Scott: But yeah, then you can just say what you know.

10
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,256
Rym: Yeah, very rare is doesn't?

11
00:00:44,276 --> 00:00:47,006
Scott: that is not battle tech and battle tech in the same year.

12
00:00:47,287 --> 00:00:52,949
Rym: Yeah so, uh Stanley Cup playoffs are happening and it's still weird to me.

13
00:00:53,311 --> 00:01:00,770
Rym: This is the first time in my entire sentient life that no team I cared about was in the Stanley Cup playoffs.

14
00:01:01,373 --> 00:01:11,269
Rym: Like there were some years where the Red Wings got eliminated in the first round But they were always there and the first year in a long long long long time They were not in the playoffs.

15
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:28,809
Rym: I think they set a record for most consecutive playoff occurrences in the modern like not original six era because the original six era What four teams made it to the playoffs out of six and it was the same for almost every year But not counting the Challenge Cup era for obvious reasons.

16
00:01:29,252 --> 00:01:35,650
Rym: But just as the Red Wings for the first time didn't make it I'd been living in New York for like a decade and the Rangers are in the play.

17
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,510
Scott: So there was a screenshot someone showed from I guess a shot from one of the games recently.

18
00:01:40,657 --> 00:01:40,827
Scott: Yeah

19
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:40,970
Rym: I

20
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:56,947
Scott: probably I think a lightning game and it was like players with most playoff appearances in the past X years and it was just like a little corner graphic and almost everyone on that list was a New York Ranger until very recently,

21
00:01:57,087 --> 00:01:57,569
Rym: so I guess it

22
00:01:57,609 --> 00:01:58,010
Scott: was like.

23
00:02:02,442 --> 00:02:04,410
Rym: Well to your point it's zero cups.

24
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:09,243
Scott: Yeah, that's why it was most playoff game appearances.

25
00:02:09,423 --> 00:02:11,510
Scott: Yeah going deep got you more on that list.

26
00:02:11,952 --> 00:02:19,789
Rym: I'm uh, I'm very conflicted now because on one hand I just wanted no Pennsylvania team to still be in the playoffs and we have succeeded at this.

27
00:02:21,671 --> 00:02:24,702
Rym: But Pennsylvania is the bottom right corner and they're gone the asshole.

28
00:02:24,722 --> 00:02:30,704
Scott: they put all their stupid balls in the football Yeah, and fuck them, but well, it's it's past.

29
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:40,487
Rym: and on one hand I don't like Tampa because they have historically been a team that has not teams I care about out of the playoffs, but on the other hand, it's basically the Tampa Rangers.

30
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:43,942
Scott: at this point It is the 2015 New York Rangers of Florida.

31
00:02:44,324 --> 00:02:45,810
Scott: Yeah, 2015, Florida Rangers.

32
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:50,270
Rym: And as I forgot until you reminded me Rangers get a conditional draft pick, right?

33
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:59,990
Scott: So there is a conditional draft pick where if Tampa wins the cup this year, I think or maybe even next year Then the they have a draft pick that already belongs to the Rangers.

34
00:03:00,151 --> 00:03:05,450
Scott: But that draft pick will move from the second round to the first round if Tampa wins.

35
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:08,190
Scott: And of course if Tampa wins it would be the last pick in the first round.

36
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,169
Scott: But last pick in the first round is still a few pigs better than you know.

37
00:03:13,592 --> 00:03:16,442
Scott: Pick it like close to last pick in the second round.

38
00:03:16,562 --> 00:03:25,403
Rym: Yeah, that's a big move up if Tampa wins So but on the other hand that upper left quadrant of like the Predators and the Jets I don't really watch those teams or know about him.

39
00:03:25,423 --> 00:03:26,470
Rym: I don't really care that much.

40
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:32,696
Scott: Well, because you know unlike the other sporting leagues, you know It's like you don't see.

41
00:03:33,037 --> 00:03:36,450
Scott: but if you're in the hockey East you don't see the West too much.

42
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,710
Scott: Yeah, you see like the West like one game a year per team.

43
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:48,188
Rym: But I think in the end I'm still rooting for the Vegas Golden Knights and the reasons are pretty simple one if they win They will be fucking insufferable.

44
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,619
Rym: There'll be an entire year of batting a thousand.

45
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,301
Rym: That's right.

46
00:03:52,341 --> 00:04:00,369
Scott: every Stanley Cup we've been up for came in and taught you Yeah, it's just like when Rym plays a game for the first time and wins.

47
00:04:01,294 --> 00:04:02,570
Scott: I'm undefeated in this game.

48
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:08,870
Rym: Yeah, my my pro move is to learn a degenerate baby strategy for a first time game and never play it again.

49
00:04:10,493 --> 00:04:13,450
Scott: Well, you can say this if you were you the Golden Knights you would stop playing hockey.

50
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,785
Rym: Yeah, just retire the team like we're done hundred percent Stanley Cups.

51
00:04:16,885 --> 00:04:17,930
Scott: close the arena we built.

52
00:04:20,331 --> 00:04:21,214
Rym: So it'll also.

53
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:24,304
Rym: it'll anger the most people.

54
00:04:24,906 --> 00:04:25,909
Scott: no doesn't anger me.

55
00:04:25,989 --> 00:04:28,179
Scott: yeah I just think I don't know why people are upset.

56
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:30,510
Rym: people like Don Cherry will probably be furious.

57
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,396
Rym: Yeah, I think he'd be madder.

58
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,543
Rym: I think he'd be really mad about this.

59
00:04:35,564 --> 00:04:36,005
Scott: who cares?

60
00:04:36,487 --> 00:04:39,473
Scott: so I've been watching They win.

61
00:04:39,554 --> 00:04:43,750
Scott: or like the Jets win, what's the difference, you know, the national predators aren't a very old team.

62
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,460
Scott: What if they win is not what they're allowed, you know, yes But is this so the reason I bring this up?

63
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,947
Rym: cuz I think I kind of when I panels.

64
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:50,630
Rym: they talked about this.

65
00:04:51,212 --> 00:04:52,899
Rym: I and I've been talking about this a lot lately.

66
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:58,841
Rym: I think the Vegas Golden Knights are doing so well Specifically because of the structure of the expansion draft.

67
00:04:58,881 --> 00:04:59,142
Scott: Yes.

68
00:04:59,302 --> 00:05:01,490
Scott: This is not a thing you think this is the thing that is.

69
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,050
Rym: Yeah, no, but game did like game design is Tuesday GeekNights.

70
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:12,173
Scott: So the deal is if you play the expansion draft was structured in such a way and the owner and the GM of the Golden Knights milk it.

71
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:17,190
Scott: they made deals before the draft even happened to sort everything out.

72
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:24,936
Scott: Yeah, so that they basically it wasn't an expansion draft because usually when there's an expansion in sports You have multiple teams coming in.

73
00:05:24,977 --> 00:05:26,703
Scott: here is just one team being added.

74
00:05:26,843 --> 00:05:28,610
Scott: Yeah, and they basically wasn't a draft.

75
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,333
Scott: It was a looting.

76
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:30,699
Scott: they looted all the other team.

77
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:33,190
Rym: every team could protect like a small number of people.

78
00:05:33,632 --> 00:05:41,610
Rym: So this team this is a hockey team that could not get any superstars But could otherwise get pretty much anyone they wanted and design their team.

79
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,575
Rym: It's like the difference between.

80
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:45,770
Rym: here's the analogy in dungeons and dragons third and fourth edition.

81
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:54,345
Rym: If you play a character from level 1 to level 10 You're gonna make a lot of compromises along the way because the sunk cost and situations and everything.

82
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,559
Scott: and you build you this thing Again, you can explain it much simpler than that.

83
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,099
Scott: It's like you're playing El Grande and you know And you can't get first place anywhere.

84
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:03,838
Scott: You just automatically get second place everywhere You win.

85
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:04,866
Scott: Yeah at the most points.

86
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:05,852
Rym: Yep The end.

87
00:06:06,153 --> 00:06:15,190
Rym: but if you make a D&D character level 10 from the beginning you craft that perfect specialty option from the beginning and ignore all the history.

88
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:17,758
Rym: So I don't see what happens in the hockey's.

89
00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:19,465
Rym: but there is much more important news.

90
00:06:19,987 --> 00:06:22,759
Scott: at least for me This is such isn't the biggest news.

91
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:25,010
Rym: It is for me because the steam controller is garbage.

92
00:06:25,372 --> 00:06:25,814
Rym: I said it.

93
00:06:25,914 --> 00:06:28,930
Scott: so the steam controller is kind of I mean it has good parts in bed.

94
00:06:29,372 --> 00:06:33,070
Rym: Boy has two good parts the left paddle button the right paddle button.

95
00:06:33,592 --> 00:06:36,766
Scott: But yeah, the steam controller is not the controller of choice.

96
00:06:36,806 --> 00:06:38,717
Scott: I think for pretty much anyone There's a reason why.

97
00:06:38,737 --> 00:06:40,350
Scott: there's a reason why they're in the discount bin.

98
00:06:40,871 --> 00:06:45,446
Rym: There's a reason why my steam controller ran out of battery because there wasn't even a battery in it anymore.

99
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:49,782
Scott: Xbox controller At least the Xbox 360 controller is still great.

100
00:06:50,224 --> 00:06:51,630
Scott: I haven't used an X bone controller.

101
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,350
Scott: I'm sure it's just fine except the d-pad on it is meh, but otherwise just fine if you don't need the d-pad.

102
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,457
Scott: D-pad is serviceable, but not great.

103
00:06:58,577 --> 00:07:02,770
Scott: Yeah, the PlayStation controller a lot of people love those fart noise.

104
00:07:03,011 --> 00:07:08,810
Scott: The only reason I do not like them is because the d-pad on them while functional has separation.

105
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:16,610
Scott: I mean, I know that it's still underneath a solid d-pad But it has this plastic cross so that you can't really touch all of that d-pad.

106
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:25,242
Scott: It's it's effectively like these four separate buttons sort of and it offends my sensibilities Even though it works better than the Xbox one.

107
00:07:25,262 --> 00:07:27,170
Scott: I add is unusable for me.

108
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:27,672
Rym: Well, that's it.

109
00:07:27,732 --> 00:07:31,570
Scott: It offends our old grog Nardi sensibilities, but the rest of the controller is just fine.

110
00:07:31,871 --> 00:07:35,450
Rym: I have a much more fundamental beef with the PlayStation controller.

111
00:07:36,012 --> 00:07:41,990
Rym: I never really had PlayStations and during the Soul Calibur era Soul Calibur 2 I use the game of cube controller.

112
00:07:42,151 --> 00:07:44,501
Rym: I don't want to use a PlayStation controller.

113
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:46,370
Scott: controller is basically perfect.

114
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:58,572
Scott: Yeah, except for the fact that it's kind of weird and doesn't really match well with games that use a normal shape Except for Soul Calibur 2 where it matched better than any other controller because the whole horizontal vertical attack thing Right.

115
00:07:58,652 --> 00:08:01,870
Scott: Anyway, so now you've got the switch pro controller.

116
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:07,648
Scott: The switch pro controller is basically perfect except it does not have analog buttons on the top.

117
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,494
Scott: and oh, you know The the throttling ones.

118
00:08:09,554 --> 00:08:11,421
Scott: it only has four regular buttons on the.

119
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:12,345
Rym: but to be fair.

120
00:08:12,365 --> 00:08:13,730
Rym: I haven't played a game.

121
00:08:14,052 --> 00:08:15,783
Scott: Two regular buttons on the top.

122
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:16,770
Rym: I don't remember.

123
00:08:17,913 --> 00:08:22,617
Scott: The point is it doesn't have the throttles like, you know The the analog levers for anything.

124
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:24,422
Scott: needs that any racing game.

125
00:08:24,944 --> 00:08:27,030
Rym: name a name a game that needs that that you play.

126
00:08:27,554 --> 00:08:29,127
Scott: I place f-zero will come.

127
00:08:30,032 --> 00:08:34,003
Rym: Yeah, well, we'll see what happens if f-zero comes on the switch.

128
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:35,769
Scott: Mario Kart doesn't have it but it could.

129
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:36,772
Rym: yeah It could.

130
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:38,561
Rym: now cuz Mario Kart is a whole different ballgame.

131
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,986
Scott: I'm just saying Mario Kart.

132
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:42,376
Rym: there There are exactly two settings.

133
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:45,087
Rym: Your gas is going all the time or you have lost.

134
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:50,582
Scott: I'm just saying Racing games where you want to have that analog throttle.

135
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:57,090
Rym: I'm just saying name a racing game you have played I don't know in the last decade f-zero Where did what did you last play f-zero?

136
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,990
Scott: definitely since 2008.

137
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,062
Rym: yeah since 2008.

138
00:09:03,062 --> 00:09:04,108
Scott: Then I played f-zero GX

139
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:08,605
Rym: Anyway, but this is a big deal for me partly because

140
00:09:09,128 --> 00:09:22,208
Scott: oh, but yeah The news is that steam is now officially supporting the switch pro controller Which means you can now use it with your HDPC and you can get rid of your Xbox controllers that you had just because.

141
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:26,923
Scott: yeah Yeah, but the thing is the switch pro controller is more expensive.

142
00:09:26,963 --> 00:09:28,750
Scott: I'm not like throwing out my Xbox controllers.

143
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,217
Rym: The other thing you know, it's gonna happen.

144
00:09:30,317 --> 00:09:31,743
Scott: It's annoying to switch.

145
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,029
Scott: It's it's a switch.

146
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:37,242
Scott: I know I just swap the pro controller between your switch and your PC.

147
00:09:37,302 --> 00:09:39,990
Scott: Yeah, so and buying more of them would be expensive.

148
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,804
Scott: So I'm not gonna probably do this unless like I really need to get

149
00:09:43,025 --> 00:09:56,909
Rym: I am going to buy one more pro controller to plug into my main PC not my HDPC because I play a lot of games here and I don't want to have to keep repairing the Xbox controllers in the other room in here on this PC.

150
00:09:56,989 --> 00:10:01,629
Rym: and I don't want to use the fucking steam controller because I have a very low opinion of it.

151
00:10:01,991 --> 00:10:07,026
Scott: You know what game needs those analog levers that I have played definitely within the last decade.

152
00:10:07,247 --> 00:10:11,222
Scott: Yeah Rocket League Oh, yep, actually the steam controller is the only thing.

153
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:13,290
Rym: I mean, how does Rocket League work on the switch?

154
00:10:15,475 --> 00:10:15,963
Scott: Not as good.

155
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:18,850
Scott: Oh Okay, I haven't played Rocket League on the switch.

156
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:26,723
Scott: I used to actually use the steam controller when I played Rocket League and actually I did too because that was It was like actually good for that the pedal buttons.

157
00:10:26,763 --> 00:10:27,848
Rym: I used for my juking around.

158
00:10:27,888 --> 00:10:28,811
Rym: It was yeah It was.

159
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:34,467
Scott: it was actually, you know better than slightly better than the Xbox controller in some ways for that one game.

160
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:37,076
Rym: Yep Man, just steam.

161
00:10:37,658 --> 00:10:43,249
Scott: Why can't someone just make a switch pro controller with some analog levers on it And then it can throw away every other controller and buy five of those?

162
00:10:43,531 --> 00:10:51,080
Rym: Yep, that would be worth the investment and then never buy another controller again, frankly I should just get USB converters or use an old gaming cube controllers.

163
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:53,307
Scott: I mean the switch pro controller is USB C.

164
00:10:54,312 --> 00:11:02,084
Rym: Oh, yeah but the fact that it's getting official support is a big deal because Actually also I have a USB converter that can take four game controllers at once.

165
00:11:02,144 --> 00:11:07,809
Rym: there was a time in my life when I was Very willing to hack and fiddle with things, but I don't got time for that shit.

166
00:11:08,511 --> 00:11:14,649
Rym: I am too old to like install a special driver to make a weird thing work on my control on my computer.

167
00:11:14,669 --> 00:11:21,166
Rym: Nope so in some other news, I Played two games at pat does then kai khan.

168
00:11:21,206 --> 00:11:22,653
Scott: so it's not news It's a gig.

169
00:11:22,713 --> 00:11:24,661
Rym: It's two gig bites really big bites.

170
00:11:24,781 --> 00:11:27,150
Rym: I'm gonna talk about these two games because they're there is a thread.

171
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,197
Rym: They are both designed by coal.

172
00:11:29,478 --> 00:11:31,223
Rym: Well, where are they?

173
00:11:31,244 --> 00:11:33,210
Scott: Well, you can't even pronounce the person's name.

174
00:11:33,452 --> 00:11:51,190
Rym: Oh, but these are two games That I don't know if you will like but you seem to want to play And They're similar in some regard John made by the same person and an infamous traffic.

175
00:11:51,551 --> 00:11:52,856
Scott: Well, I've heard of the John company.

176
00:11:53,057 --> 00:11:56,190
Rym: So an infamous traffic is the same person and similar concept.

177
00:11:56,551 --> 00:12:09,910
Rym: So the idea of an infamous traffic or both these games are that there is a historical So geo-economic or power structure of some kind like the opium in infamous traffic is about the opium trade.

178
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:10,852
Scott: Oh great.

179
00:12:11,474 --> 00:12:13,881
Rym: And yeah, these are these games are interesting.

180
00:12:13,921 --> 00:12:16,347
Scott: So it's based on the car the present day.

181
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:25,039
Rym: Uh, yeah, especially because like I might argue that the area around Lancaster is the Ground zero of the current opioid epidemic.

182
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:26,544
Scott: It sounds right.

183
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:30,496
Rym: I will say that jokes about Pennsylvania and Lancaster.

184
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:34,190
Rym: in the course of playing this game in Lancaster where shall we say abundance?

185
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,568
Rym: Mm-hmm as were people who appeared to be.

186
00:12:37,394 --> 00:12:37,978
Rym: There appeared to be.

187
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,880
Rym: there's a mechanic in this game called opportunity Which basically means are there people who want opium in this area?

188
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:50,648
Rym: Yes, and I think that there were a lot of opportunities in the area where this convention is.

189
00:12:51,832 --> 00:13:05,710
Rym: But John company and I realized got to know this is about the British East India company Mm-hmm, and if you don't know most people I realized have a middle school social studies knowledge of what the East India Company did.

190
00:13:06,255 --> 00:13:08,580
Rym: Don't really know Both of these.

191
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:09,550
Scott: I mean, I know what it did.

192
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:15,642
Scott: I just didn't know the one fact that you just told me which is that the name of it was not I do that East India.

193
00:13:15,682 --> 00:13:16,609
Rym: What did it do?

194
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:24,089
Scott: Completely controlled all trade between Britain and all these colonies and all these other places and such and such.

195
00:13:24,773 --> 00:13:26,542
Rym: It's actually way more complicated than that.

196
00:13:26,603 --> 00:13:30,819
Rym: it was basically its own Sovereign government mega Corp.

197
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:41,369
Rym: Yep, and it had its own armies multiple of them So boats that invaded and conquered India on its own not without necessarily having permission to do so.

198
00:13:42,953 --> 00:13:58,389
Rym: but anyway, these games are basically very nuanced and shockingly accurate simulations of How these two things functioned From the perspective of the people who were driving them.

199
00:13:58,831 --> 00:14:03,010
Rym: So you basically in both cases play a shitty white dude in Britain?

200
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,678
Rym: Who has and your victory points what you actually do to win.

201
00:14:06,698 --> 00:14:07,500
Rym: the games are?

202
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:18,870
Rym: analogous to the actual motivations of those people which came down to Bullshit around social standing and getting your relatives into comfortable positions.

203
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:39,770
Rym: But as a result So in John company You're basically you're doing things like get someone in your family to be the executive in this part of the East India company Who's responsible for something and all the players get relatives in all these different places And if you have a relative who's like in charge of procurement or in charge of the second presidency army you

204
00:14:40,654 --> 00:14:40,775
Scott: can do

205
00:14:40,795 --> 00:14:47,650
Rym: whatever the fuck you want that you're in charge of that and You all have to work together to make sure the company doesn't just go bankrupt.

206
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:54,355
Rym: Well simultaneously trying to achieve your goals and basically these games are Some of the most.

207
00:14:54,576 --> 00:14:56,830
Rym: like you I were a teacher in a high school.

208
00:14:57,332 --> 00:15:01,310
Rym: I would make kids play these games to learn about these concepts rather than read a history book.

209
00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:06,043
Rym: That is how high an opinion I have on the history and function of these games.

210
00:15:06,604 --> 00:15:10,849
Rym: However, I do not know if They're necessarily enjoyable.

211
00:15:11,572 --> 00:15:16,890
Rym: Nor do I know if you will like them, but I like them and I would know I don't want to step that back.

212
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,862
Rym: I appreciate them and I want to play them again.

213
00:15:20,882 --> 00:15:28,410
Rym: I am not sure if I like them But I appreciate them and kind of like with quartermaster general.

214
00:15:28,571 --> 00:15:31,926
Rym: I just want to play them again, and I just always want to play them again.

215
00:15:31,946 --> 00:15:36,504
Scott: It's weird How I like quartermaster general, but it doesn't matter because you're a bullshit.

216
00:15:36,545 --> 00:15:37,930
Rym: you are banned from quartermaster.

217
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:40,870
Scott: I don't know why you guys are against just slightly.

218
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,779
Rym: You're banned from quartermaster general.

219
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,903
Rym: You think we're joking.

220
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,430
Rym: you're banned from this game for life.

221
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:49,053
Scott: What's your problem?

222
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,217
Rym: because none of us want that.

223
00:15:50,437 --> 00:15:51,461
Scott: why don't you want that?

224
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,330
Rym: because the game as it is is exactly what we want.

225
00:15:54,491 --> 00:15:55,957
Scott: Then why do you want garbage?

226
00:15:56,379 --> 00:15:58,610
Scott: It's it's so close to perfection yet so far.

227
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:01,790
Rym: This is why I don't know what your opinion will be of John company.

228
00:16:02,731 --> 00:16:06,969
Rym: I don't know if you're gonna feel if you're gonna do the quartermaster general thing or if you're gonna be into it.

229
00:16:07,612 --> 00:16:14,938
Rym: I all I know is that we got to play this game so we can do a show on it And I'm sure we will accomplish this at a coming packs.

230
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:24,884
Rym: and in case anyone didn't know Scott is legit banned from the game of quartermaster And in perpetuity and you you laugh, but you are bad.

231
00:16:25,345 --> 00:16:27,470
Scott: There's no way that game would just be so good.

232
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:30,907
Scott: I don't know why you guys are so obstinate about making it already is so good.

233
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:31,550
Scott: No, it's not.

234
00:16:32,073 --> 00:16:34,910
Rym: It's like saying you know what we really need to do to fix battle tech.

235
00:16:35,332 --> 00:16:39,730
Rym: No small lasers and no jump jets because they're bullshit and no look-up tables.

236
00:16:40,811 --> 00:16:46,150
Scott: No, it would be bullshit if you had dice that were like all ones with like one six on one of the dice.

237
00:16:46,331 --> 00:16:48,319
Rym: But that's how it feels when you play real battle tech.

238
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:49,684
Rym: Anyway, no, it's not.

239
00:16:49,745 --> 00:16:51,010
Rym: It's always just miss bad.

240
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,856
Rym: I guess miss glancing.

241
00:16:52,896 --> 00:16:53,999
Rym: blow to center torso.

242
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:54,601
Scott: battle is 2d 6.

243
00:16:54,601 --> 00:16:54,681
Scott: Yep.

244
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:57,530
Scott: 2d 6 2d 6 2d 6.

245
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:03,467
Scott: It's not like, you know a D that always rolls a 1 and then a D with 5 ones and a 6 on it.

246
00:17:04,932 --> 00:17:09,069
Rym: So we got one less little news that isn't really gaming related, but you got to see this shit.

247
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:10,578
Scott: Why I didn't?

248
00:17:10,637 --> 00:17:12,230
Scott: I was just sending this to you cuz you need to see it.

249
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,296
Rym: Oh, you don't want to talk about it today.

250
00:17:13,316 --> 00:17:14,300
Scott: Is it for Monday?

251
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,307
Rym: All right, we'll save for Monday.

252
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:16,915
Scott: Monday What the fuck you gonna do?

253
00:17:17,117 --> 00:17:19,290
Rym: Never mind, you don't get to learn about this today.

254
00:17:25,332 --> 00:17:27,130
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

255
00:17:27,251 --> 00:17:29,320
Rym: So I am a fan of Rube Goldberg machines.

256
00:17:29,702 --> 00:17:32,895
Rym: when I was a kid in middle school in high school I competed in the Zulberg

257
00:17:32,915 --> 00:17:36,929
Scott: machines have probably been things of the day more often than any other category of yep

258
00:17:37,471 --> 00:17:47,341
Rym: But kind of like it's one of those rules where like a steamed hams edit where you can't just Use these things as things of the day Unless there's some unique thing about this

259
00:17:47,462 --> 00:17:47,562
Scott: one.

260
00:17:47,582 --> 00:17:49,350
Scott: I mean, I'm sure there's like a Rube Goldberg community.

261
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:54,230
Scott: We could make a whole podcast about Rube Goldberg machines only there probably is a tire podcast.

262
00:17:54,592 --> 00:17:54,794
Scott: but

263
00:17:55,337 --> 00:18:21,246
Rym: this Rube Goldberg machine is particularly fascinating because it breaks some of the tropes of Rube Goldberg machines and it also Surprised me at several junctures in terms of how it functioned and it was subtle Kinda like our friend Luke the juggler who makes points about how a juggling routine Can be made funny through intrinsic properties of juggling and good stagecraft.

264
00:18:21,888 --> 00:18:30,510
Rym: There are some extremely well-crafted Visual jokes in this Rube Goldberg machine and I do not even want to spoil them.

265
00:18:30,932 --> 00:18:31,996
Rym: You just need to watch it.

266
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:35,010
Rym: And all I want to say is keep an eye on that laptop.

267
00:18:36,612 --> 00:18:38,610
Rym: Okay, this Rube Goldberg machine is fantastic.

268
00:18:39,431 --> 00:18:47,110
Rym: It's probably it is on the level of that slow motion Rube Goldberg machine that okay go did in terms of how much I enjoyed.

269
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,649
Scott: Why like the Rube Goldberg the Japanese kids want to tell the story the story?

270
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,162
Rym: Oh, what was that called a balls adventure something something like that.

271
00:18:54,223 --> 00:18:54,965
Rym: I forget what that was.

272
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:55,829
Rym: Anyway, what do you got?

273
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,688
Scott: Oh, so it's just a tweet, but the tweet had a funny video in it.

274
00:19:00,795 --> 00:19:02,206
Scott: It looks like it's Japanese.

275
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:07,564
Scott: Of course Basically two dudes in pink bodysuit things.

276
00:19:08,006 --> 00:19:13,370
Scott: They're on some bicycle And this bicycle is interesting and that is a tandem bicycle.

277
00:19:14,073 --> 00:19:37,790
Scott: Yet one of the seats the rear seat is facing Backwards so one person's facing forward and one person's facing backwards and they're riding on this sort of side of the road with a jersey Barrier next to them and on the other side of the jersey barrier is a legit pro bike race happening And the peloton is right there and they're biking ahead of the peloton And I guess one person is watching the race because they're facing back.

278
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:47,547
Rym: It looks like bikers threw something at them at one point I don't know and the other like this very clueless moment where something gets thrown at them Like people don't seem happy about them being there I don't know.

279
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,670
Scott: But the other the other person is just looking forward and biking and smiling.

280
00:19:51,711 --> 00:20:00,334
Scott: Yeah if you go to the next tweet and reply you can actually see the bicycle up close and how the gearing works to Make this thing possible.

281
00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:01,517
Rym: It's cleverly done.

282
00:20:01,537 --> 00:20:05,248
Scott: It's you know, it's a hack together together mess, but it works.

283
00:20:05,308 --> 00:20:07,933
Rym: So It's it's just.

284
00:20:07,953 --> 00:20:10,099
Rym: they'll just watch it and appreciate it for what it is.

285
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:10,961
Scott: Mm-hmm.

286
00:20:12,104 --> 00:20:20,236
Scott: I like how the the text in the Pretty much as a bunch of W's and then some Japanese moon language In the meta moment.

287
00:20:20,296 --> 00:20:21,684
Rym: the book club book for geek.

288
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:26,524
Rym: the GeekNights book club If you didn't know we have a book club is Emily Wilson's translation of the Odyssey.

289
00:20:26,585 --> 00:20:30,458
Rym: I assume Scott has read zero More pages of this good assumption.

290
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:31,783
Rym: All right, we will.

291
00:20:31,843 --> 00:20:32,245
Scott: I'm busy.

292
00:20:32,285 --> 00:20:33,108
Scott: I'm getting new furniture.

293
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:36,590
Scott: on Saturday I had to take apart all the furniture in my apartment and throw it out.

294
00:20:37,011 --> 00:20:43,555
Rym: I got a bunch of flights coming up cuz I'm going to be not Scott and not geek not just me with Emily at TCAF this weekend in Toronto.

295
00:20:43,615 --> 00:20:46,346
Rym: So one if you're in Toronto and you're gonna be a TCAF.

296
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:47,250
Scott: What's TCAF?

297
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:55,130
Rym: It's basically a comic convention similar to like mocha or SPX or Emerald City comic-con.

298
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,489
Rym: A lot of our friends will be there.

299
00:20:56,671 --> 00:20:56,933
Scott: It's not.

300
00:20:56,993 --> 00:20:58,909
Scott: Emerald City comic-con is like a real comic-con.

301
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:03,090
Rym: It's not an indie show like yeah, but there's a big indie presence there and a lot of the same people go.

302
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:06,069
Rym: I mean New York comic-con has an indie presence in the artist alley too.

303
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,909
Rym: I specifically left New York comic-con off that.

304
00:21:09,951 --> 00:21:12,099
Scott: Emerald City is you know, no different than like Heroes.

305
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,070
Rym: Emerald City has a way bigger indie presence than you realize.

306
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:16,936
Scott: So does every other comic-con.

307
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:18,540
Rym: Yeah, not New York comic-con.

308
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,644
Scott: Even San Diego does.

309
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:23,649
Scott: you just don't see it in the news about San Diego Because the news about San Diego doesn't cover it.

310
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:27,489
Scott: Yeah, they have a giant and massive artist alley that has all the indie peoples in it.

311
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:33,135
Rym: Yeah, not all because a lot of the people I know who go to these things that like a lot There's a lot of indie people.

312
00:21:33,155 --> 00:21:35,382
Scott: Yeah, not all of them go to all the guys.

313
00:21:35,402 --> 00:21:46,670
Rym: But there is a huge huge overlap between ECCC and SPX and TCAF and Though like that Venn diagram is tighter than a lot of the other clusters of conventions.

314
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:54,145
Rym: but anyway, I'll be there hanging out and otherwise, they'll just be digging around in Toronto for the weekend and This previous weekend I was at Zenkai Con.

315
00:21:54,286 --> 00:21:54,990
Rym: we did three panels.

316
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:59,653
Rym: So if you were here listening to this or watching the stream because you saw me at Zenkai Con Well, guess what?

317
00:22:00,096 --> 00:22:10,304
Rym: I posted notes and links and stuff If you go to our website A lot of people seem to find the YouTube channel Can't quite make the leap from that channel to the fact that we actually have a website.

318
00:22:10,545 --> 00:22:11,789
Scott: people don't use websites.

319
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:14,878
Scott: It's 2018 yep, like they just go to.

320
00:22:14,938 --> 00:22:18,067
Scott: you know one place like Twitter only or YouTube only.

321
00:22:18,168 --> 00:22:26,190
Rym: it's extra sad But I started putting links to our YouTube on our flyers instead of our website and it increased the response rate heavily.

322
00:22:27,671 --> 00:22:40,830
Rym: so whatever we have a website and if you go to that website, you can see actually a video of one of the panels I did from a different con way more professional because it's the video for packs and Zenkai Con was super fun and the funniest thing that happened was on the way home.

323
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:52,870
Rym: there were all these teams who were on the train who went to Zenkai Con from New York City and they were loud and I Overheard their conversation and the conversation was basically these kids go to cons like you and I used to go to cons.

324
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,056
Rym: They go to like every anime con.

325
00:22:54,076 --> 00:22:56,287
Rym: Hmm, and they're pretty they get money from.

326
00:22:56,307 --> 00:22:56,970
Scott: if they're teens.

327
00:22:57,532 --> 00:23:01,426
Rym: Well, they're like teens and a couple of them are like freshmen in college and they go.

328
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:02,330
Scott: where do they get money from?

329
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:02,851
Rym: I don't know.

330
00:23:02,871 --> 00:23:03,092
Rym: They do.

331
00:23:03,113 --> 00:23:06,369
Rym: the East Coast Con circuit cram 12 people in a hotel room like we used to.

332
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,323
Rym: but the funniest things were one.

333
00:23:09,343 --> 00:23:13,580
Rym: they Someone brought up Otakon and they all started laughing.

334
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,290
Rym: They're like, yeah who even fucking goes to Otakon anymore?

335
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:18,216
Scott: Otakon moved and changed in.

336
00:23:18,236 --> 00:23:18,417
Scott: such.

337
00:23:18,658 --> 00:23:25,861
Rym: one of them went this year and was like the previous Otakon and they were like Yeah the panels are like way worse than Zenkai Con's panels.

338
00:23:26,122 --> 00:23:29,678
Rym: all the good people don't go anymore and And the convention center is a hole.

339
00:23:30,563 --> 00:23:34,840
Rym: and one of the other ones is like yeah anime boss is like the only anime con worth going to anymore.

340
00:23:35,261 --> 00:23:43,695
Rym: and then they basically were like if you want to see panels Literally go to any con because no con has higher quality panels, but they don't go to gaming cons They only go to anime cons.

341
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:55,710
Rym: So in the estimation of this large group of teens to summarize Zenkai Con has the exact same level of quality of panels as every major anime con on the Eastern Seaboard.

342
00:23:57,432 --> 00:24:08,950
Rym: I don't know if that is speaking highly of Zenkai Con or speaking lowly of the Eastern Seaboard But that is the information that I have from a large group of teens who are very loud over the course of two and a half hours.

343
00:24:10,838 --> 00:24:16,890
Rym: So I Have always for a very long time because I really enjoyed playing battle tech which we reviewed on GeekNights a long time ago.

344
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,000
Rym: Apparently, I don't remember doing this.

345
00:24:19,462 --> 00:24:21,250
Rym: I really like tabletop battle tech.

346
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:28,070
Rym: I really like rolling 2d6 over and over again and like this sort of squad based combat in these really fiddly details.

347
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,057
Scott: Well cuz battle tech the pen and paper game.

348
00:24:30,077 --> 00:24:37,430
Scott: We actually did an episode on it super super super long ago Back in the way early days of GeekNights where we lived in Beacon.

349
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:47,703
Scott: Yeah but pen and paper battle tech is a game where you can get all the joy of a miniatures game where you know on your Turn you move and shoot and you roll dice to determine how much you hit and such.

350
00:24:47,743 --> 00:24:48,746
Rym: but miniatures game.

351
00:24:48,807 --> 00:24:49,609
Rym: in the like it

352
00:24:49,690 --> 00:25:17,570
Scott: is actually Simpler and more comprehensible and you dealing with less units and also giant robots Yeah, and you also get the fun of like custom, you know, instead of customizing like this whole army like Warhammer You you know in each individual unit you're actually just customizing like a couple giant robots and it's pretty easy to do, you know, and It's fun to fill in little bubbles when you get hit right like everything about it is like this sort of.

353
00:25:18,512 --> 00:25:26,430
Scott: It's sort of like this elegant system where you have a complex game That is easier to play than other games that are equally complex.

354
00:25:26,678 --> 00:25:32,410
Scott: Yep Because it's just designed so nicely and that is why battle tech has been around Almost as long as I have lived.

355
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:38,920
Scott: I think the game was invented in like 1984 or something like that but also it's been around since then and it's still around and it's still big.

356
00:25:39,181 --> 00:25:44,216
Rym: these games edge into wargame territory and Simulatory territory and that they're.

357
00:25:44,717 --> 00:25:57,296
Rym: they're more like simulations and simulations of this fictional galaxy universe whatever you want to call it, but in terms of they're kind of random and not that fair and more like Real-world tactical decision-making.

358
00:25:57,357 --> 00:25:58,560
Rym: like it's not.

359
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,387
Scott: it's not Gundam where these are super-powered robots of like.

360
00:26:01,467 --> 00:26:02,430
Scott: oh we got awesomeness.

361
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:03,152
Rym: This is more like.

362
00:26:03,253 --> 00:26:05,941
Scott: you know battle tech is slow and dumpy robots.

363
00:26:05,961 --> 00:26:13,878
Rym: They go like that are huge and go kitchen like Situations like oh they busted through my left armor and blew up the ammo for my weapon.

364
00:26:13,918 --> 00:26:16,953
Rym: Now my pilots hurt and Really unluckily.

365
00:26:16,973 --> 00:26:17,957
Rym: I'm in a bad situation.

366
00:26:18,017 --> 00:26:29,959
Scott: That's really the fun of battle tech is the stimulatory things where it's like, alright Well, I got knocked over and now falling down the hill and I took damage in this specific part and that part had ammo in It and there's a chance the ammo explodes.

367
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:30,863
Scott: it did.

368
00:26:31,164 --> 00:26:32,410
Scott: All right that ammo exploded.

369
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,599
Scott: How much damage does it do this much?

370
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,764
Scott: what happens now?

371
00:26:35,784 --> 00:26:37,230
Scott: Well, it damaged your gyro.

372
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,413
Scott: It's gonna be hard to stand up.

373
00:26:38,474 --> 00:26:45,836
Scott: everything just sort of makes sense in a common sense way without having to have this sort of like Esoteric military knowledge.

374
00:26:45,876 --> 00:26:49,890
Scott: you would have to like, you know have those grog guard war games, which also make sense.

375
00:26:50,171 --> 00:26:50,533
Rym: Yeah, right.

376
00:26:50,573 --> 00:26:53,549
Scott: This just makes sense because you understand a giant robot.

377
00:26:54,452 --> 00:26:58,585
Rym: So I've always enjoyed it, but I don't have time to play that kind of game anymore.

378
00:26:58,645 --> 00:27:01,273
Rym: or space and I have space I don't have time.

379
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:10,939
Rym: and before you say like mech war whatever those all the not official or mega mech mega mech Those things are intolerable, right?

380
00:27:10,979 --> 00:27:23,034
Scott: There are software versions of the tabletop game Back when I could tolerate pretty intolerable software that are free open source ish and their user interfaces are so bad They're not even worth attempt.

381
00:27:23,295 --> 00:27:25,442
Rym: Even when I had infinite time.

382
00:27:25,723 --> 00:27:27,268
Rym: They were not worth pursuing.

383
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:32,275
Rym: Nope So battle tech got kick-started Right.

384
00:27:32,295 --> 00:27:34,430
Scott: So actually I first discovered this at a PAX.

385
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:40,550
Scott: I was walking around and there was a booth and the booth was like battle tech and I'm like Well, this is not the catalyst booth.

386
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:44,910
Scott: Which catalyst if you don't know is the company that currently licenses and publishes.

387
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:52,883
Scott: I don't know if they own but they currently publish the pen and paper Miniatures books and stuff for battle tech tabletop.

388
00:27:53,003 --> 00:27:55,855
Scott: Yep, and it was not the catalyst booth But it was a battle tech booth.

389
00:27:55,895 --> 00:27:56,839
Scott: and I said what is this?

390
00:27:56,899 --> 00:27:59,330
Scott: and they said we are making a battle tech video game.

391
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:05,079
Scott: That is the turn-based You know pen and paper miniature battle tech only a video game.

392
00:28:05,139 --> 00:28:06,983
Scott: and I said shut up and take my monies.

393
00:28:07,063 --> 00:28:13,401
Scott: and then I went With them at another PAX and also played the beta.

394
00:28:13,421 --> 00:28:15,850
Scott: cuz I kick-started at a level where let me play the beta.

395
00:28:16,412 --> 00:28:16,753
Scott: And it was.

396
00:28:16,893 --> 00:28:17,937
Scott: I was so surprised.

397
00:28:18,338 --> 00:28:19,041
Scott: It was legit.

398
00:28:19,061 --> 00:28:20,867
Scott: Like they were actually developing this game.

399
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:21,770
Scott: It wasn't some scam.

400
00:28:22,131 --> 00:28:24,180
Scott: They were actually making this thing real.

401
00:28:24,421 --> 00:28:26,710
Scott: They were making significant progress very rapidly.

402
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:43,981
Scott: More importantly they made it right because playing the beta what you saw was Next walk and they torso twerking shooting and torso twist is key anyway, so Now just recently like a week or two ago ish I don't know the big game has been fully released.

403
00:28:44,042 --> 00:28:46,310
Scott: You can now buy whether you kick-started or not.

404
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:46,633
Scott: I already.

405
00:28:46,653 --> 00:28:48,410
Scott: I just got it because I already kick-started it.

406
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,059
Scott: Yep, you can just go on steam and buy this fucking game.

407
00:28:51,601 --> 00:28:53,467
Scott: It is out and a lot of people are playing it.

408
00:28:53,487 --> 00:28:55,826
Scott: and Great, let's talk about it.

409
00:28:55,866 --> 00:28:56,149
Rym: All right.

410
00:28:56,411 --> 00:28:57,294
Rym: So first things.

411
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:58,198
Rym: first there are two.

412
00:28:58,339 --> 00:29:01,030
Rym: I want to get these out of the way because they're kind of topical like news wise.

413
00:29:01,572 --> 00:29:04,525
Rym: There are two quote-unquote controversies about the game already.

414
00:29:04,545 --> 00:29:05,650
Scott: a lot of it's weird.

415
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:08,186
Scott: It's like it's there's a lot of controversies, but they're all.

416
00:29:08,387 --> 00:29:08,910
Scott: there's minor.

417
00:29:09,131 --> 00:29:12,892
Scott: It's like there's a lot of minor controversies and no major ones There are.

418
00:29:12,932 --> 00:29:15,744
Rym: there are two that I think are relevant and newsworthy.

419
00:29:15,885 --> 00:29:19,917
Rym: ish one of them The which the people are complaining about.

420
00:29:19,977 --> 00:29:24,570
Rym: it are wrong in my opinion and just don't understand humans or games.

421
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:28,850
Rym: But their argument is that the game shows some to hit percentages.

422
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:37,145
Rym: uh-huh, and someone proved that the actual to hit percentages are Narrower than that like the real.

423
00:29:37,186 --> 00:29:47,058
Rym: the numbers they show are slightly fabricated and they actually groom the random number generator to Effectively avoid streaks a little bit.

424
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:48,342
Scott: I wouldn't just be 2d6.

425
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:50,026
Rym: It's not just 2d6.

426
00:29:50,086 --> 00:29:50,929
Scott: Why is it not just 2d6?

427
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,336
Rym: So you didn't see this controversy.

428
00:29:53,717 --> 00:29:57,290
Scott: I did see someone saying that the percentages shown were inaccurate.

429
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:57,893
Rym: They're slightly.

430
00:29:57,914 --> 00:29:58,396
Scott: I did not.

431
00:29:58,437 --> 00:30:00,448
Scott: I did not read the actual numbers in math.

432
00:30:00,609 --> 00:30:03,799
Rym: Yeah The deal here's the real deal from.

433
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:12,630
Rym: in my semi-professional opinion on this particular issue This happens a lot in games because it turns out if you tell a human they have an n-percent chance to hit something.

434
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:29,430
Rym: Humans are so bad at math and so bad at statistics and so bad at patterns in this type of environment That if you say an 80% chance to hit and you actually hit 80% of the time They will perceive the 20% of the time they miss as bullshit.

435
00:30:30,052 --> 00:30:32,800
Rym: They will perceive that the numbers are way off.

436
00:30:33,101 --> 00:30:34,546
Rym: I mean it was a perfectly accurate.

437
00:30:34,586 --> 00:30:35,950
Scott: It is bullshit, but that's battle.

438
00:30:36,474 --> 00:30:38,570
Rym: Yeah, but it's not the right kind of bullshit.

439
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:46,741
Rym: all I'm saying is that when game companies fudge those kinds of numbers they're doing it because Your brain is dumb and they were tricking your brain.

440
00:30:47,002 --> 00:30:50,576
Rym: and as long as you don't try to peel back that onion You'll enjoy games a lot more.

441
00:30:50,596 --> 00:30:51,439
Rym: Mm-hmm.

442
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,205
Scott: You're saying is ignorance is bliss?

443
00:30:53,606 --> 00:30:57,161
Rym: in this particular case Yes, and also it's such a my one.

444
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,070
Rym: This is not an e-sport, but I'm playing to win.

445
00:30:59,751 --> 00:31:00,695
Rym: Yeah, so play to win.

446
00:31:00,715 --> 00:31:01,518
Scott: How is it not an e-sport?

447
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,570
Rym: This is not yet a major e-sport where it matters.

448
00:31:05,772 --> 00:31:08,407
Rym: And if it came to pass, I'm gonna be Battletech world champion.

449
00:31:08,427 --> 00:31:11,477
Rym: Watch out Based on our history together.

450
00:31:11,577 --> 00:31:14,188
Rym: There is no chance you will ever be the Battletech champion.

451
00:31:14,228 --> 00:31:14,549
Rym: Why not?

452
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:17,398
Rym: 18 small lasers and no rear armor.

453
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:18,402
Scott: That's just what I like.

454
00:31:18,462 --> 00:31:21,662
Scott: if I have to win and the championship is on the line It's just a LRM boat.

455
00:31:21,703 --> 00:31:25,580
Scott: Yeah I got a LRM boat and an SRM boat.

456
00:31:26,263 --> 00:31:27,750
Rym: I was always a fan of mex 2 boat.

457
00:31:27,992 --> 00:31:33,777
Rym: I've always been a fan of mex with no rear armor Like zero rear armor.

458
00:31:33,857 --> 00:31:35,785
Scott: Good luck against my jump jet and then you're dead.

459
00:31:36,026 --> 00:31:37,110
Rym: I'm already backed into a cliff.

460
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:37,854
Rym: You can't touch me.

461
00:31:37,874 --> 00:31:39,543
Scott: I can just go up on top of the mouth.

462
00:31:39,745 --> 00:31:56,270
Rym: Yeah anyway, anyway, but the other controversy and I controversy I'm making the hardest quotes ever is that shitheads and gum regators are really mad at this game because It has female male and gender neutral pronouns.

463
00:31:57,152 --> 00:32:04,361
Rym: They are the the internet shitstorm around that is Actually pretty big and it's I didn't see any of it.

464
00:32:04,662 --> 00:32:06,630
Rym: It's all shitty people.

465
00:32:06,971 --> 00:32:08,599
Scott: Anyway, well, you don't have to play battle tech.

466
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:13,449
Scott: They're trying to mass boycott the game, which is great Because that means shitty people be playing battle tech.

467
00:32:13,812 --> 00:32:16,110
Scott: Yeah, only if someone plays battle take that means they good.

468
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:19,010
Rym: But if you see anyone complaining about that at all.

469
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:33,055
Scott: And like if you see there is one thing about that that does bother me If you go and it's the character creation screen right up is if you choose he as your pronoun Yeah You get all these photos to choose from that are Stereotypically looking like dudes.

470
00:32:33,156 --> 00:32:36,285
Rym: if you click enough you also get female looking ones like it didn't know.

471
00:32:36,325 --> 00:32:38,111
Scott: if you choose she you get different Ones.

472
00:32:38,352 --> 00:32:38,914
Scott: she's they.

473
00:32:39,014 --> 00:32:40,098
Scott: you get all of them.

474
00:32:40,118 --> 00:32:43,590
Scott: So it's like why can't I choose the she looking one?

475
00:32:46,211 --> 00:32:49,261
Scott: Basically if you choose he or she you get half as many.

476
00:32:49,321 --> 00:32:52,090
Scott: you get half of the choices for your image.

477
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,560
Scott: And if you choose day, you can choose any image you want.

478
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:56,930
Scott: They should just allowed all images for all products.

479
00:32:57,652 --> 00:33:04,510
Rym: But if you see anyone complaining about these options like for real those people are basically just gummer gators and they're mad.

480
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:05,193
Scott: I thought.

481
00:33:05,293 --> 00:33:10,315
Scott: I thought the thing you were gonna bring up was that the game if you play single-player Which is what you're playing probably.

482
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:13,706
Scott: Yeah, is that there's a lot of slowness and time losing in this game.

483
00:33:13,746 --> 00:33:15,813
Scott: There are slow animations There are slow things.

484
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:16,476
Scott: You got to watch.

485
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:18,683
Scott: you got to watch FMV's you got.

486
00:33:18,944 --> 00:33:27,350
Scott: it's all this stuff in the game is very Time-consuming and waiting happens for no reason and the game could be sped up a lot.

487
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:33,376
Scott: And the example I always bring up when people say oh no you want it You can't speed it up is even Pokemon.

488
00:33:33,437 --> 00:33:34,299
Scott: lets you speed it up.

489
00:33:34,781 --> 00:33:35,663
Scott: The children's game.

490
00:33:35,703 --> 00:33:37,890
Scott: lets you turn off animations and do fast text.

491
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:38,188
Scott: Yep.

492
00:33:38,331 --> 00:33:46,061
Scott: So there is no reason that any adult game including you are stone Shouldn't allow you to turn off animations and speed everything up.

493
00:33:46,362 --> 00:33:50,619
Scott: to just let you play without any visual cruft This camera zooming it.

494
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:55,809
Scott: you can turn off some of it in the options menu And you can do other things by editing some files and stuff.

495
00:33:56,291 --> 00:34:02,590
Scott: But it's like just let me play the battle tech without any of this garbage like zooming in and watching missiles fire.

496
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:06,445
Scott: No, I want to click fire and just see a number of how much damage was done.

497
00:34:06,485 --> 00:34:12,329
Rym: So counterpoint I Actually very much enjoy the slow ramp.

498
00:34:12,972 --> 00:34:16,244
Rym: I actually in this game partly because battle tech.

499
00:34:16,685 --> 00:34:19,458
Rym: I actually really enjoy These slow animation.

500
00:34:19,498 --> 00:34:24,141
Scott: you enjoyed it one time and then I want to turn it off But I keep enjoying it because it has this interesting bit of tension.

501
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:25,889
Rym: It simulates for me.

502
00:34:26,351 --> 00:34:27,135
Scott: I don't got time for that.

503
00:34:27,155 --> 00:34:27,536
Scott: I want to hurry.

504
00:34:27,577 --> 00:34:28,440
Rym: I know I agree with you.

505
00:34:28,562 --> 00:34:41,045
Rym: The option should be there but I part of the appeal I had of original classic pen and paper battle tag was Pete shoots a thousand SRMs at me because that's what Pete liked to do.

506
00:34:41,065 --> 00:34:50,130
Rym: I then have to sit here and listen as He rolls 2d6 while Alex or you are looking at a book and say right center torso.

507
00:34:50,311 --> 00:34:55,228
Scott: Oh, that would be fine if it like fired each weapon individually, but I get that experience.

508
00:34:55,248 --> 00:34:57,530
Scott: animation No, it just makes a slow animation.

509
00:34:58,874 --> 00:35:06,467
Rym: like I see the missiles come in and they actually like they'll veer off before they hit and you get that like oh They're gonna miss and a few of them hit.

510
00:35:07,212 --> 00:35:11,070
Rym: You see the PPC fight the PVC scary than me the most because he had no indications.

511
00:35:11,372 --> 00:35:12,498
Scott: Inner sphere garbage.

512
00:35:12,518 --> 00:35:14,669
Scott: the inner PPC is like the best weapon you can get.

513
00:35:15,973 --> 00:35:18,305
Rym: It is inner sphere garbage, but give them time.

514
00:35:18,426 --> 00:35:19,250
Rym: It's like when sip five.

515
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,097
Scott: I don't know why people hate clan stuff.

516
00:35:21,117 --> 00:35:22,823
Scott: so much stuff is bullshit.

517
00:35:22,863 --> 00:35:23,826
Rym: Why it's too.

518
00:35:23,886 --> 00:35:24,830
Rym: It's op and not fun.

519
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,630
Scott: What if everyone just as clan stuff was difference?

520
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:33,108
Rym: That's that's the same as playing Dungeons & Dragons versus PvP with two level 20 characters.

521
00:35:33,189 --> 00:35:34,333
Rym: wrong with that It ain't fun.

522
00:35:34,494 --> 00:35:34,675
Scott: What's?

523
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:35,177
Scott: how was that?

524
00:35:35,418 --> 00:35:38,090
Scott: any less fun than fighting to one level one characters?

525
00:35:38,532 --> 00:35:41,283
Rym: It's uh, it's a lot different and a lot less fun.

526
00:35:41,444 --> 00:35:42,468
Scott: Why what's there ever done?

527
00:35:42,508 --> 00:35:42,890
Scott: it was there.

528
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,977
Scott: It's in heavyweight boxing and featherweight boxing.

529
00:35:44,997 --> 00:35:47,124
Rym: They're boxing way more fun to watch.

530
00:35:47,324 --> 00:35:48,468
Scott: Well, who says me?

531
00:35:48,488 --> 00:35:50,033
Scott: All right Well, I don't think this.

532
00:35:50,174 --> 00:35:51,538
Scott: I mean they're both equally.

533
00:35:51,558 --> 00:35:52,682
Scott: they're different, but I think they're.

534
00:35:52,702 --> 00:35:56,474
Rym: you got a reason why in our group No one ever.

535
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,064
Rym: you were the only one who wanted clan ever.

536
00:35:59,245 --> 00:35:59,546
Rym: Why not?

537
00:35:59,566 --> 00:36:00,650
Rym: None of us wanted clan.

538
00:36:01,072 --> 00:36:04,084
Scott: I like heavyweight boxing just it's obviously different but it's like.

539
00:36:04,104 --> 00:36:07,137
Scott: I like it just as much as Most of the clan stuff was.

540
00:36:07,157 --> 00:36:09,386
Scott: the only thing that's bullshit is intersphere verse clan.

541
00:36:09,426 --> 00:36:10,350
Scott: That's obviously stupid.

542
00:36:10,531 --> 00:36:13,943
Rym: Yeah, clan verse clan is a time and place what I know.

543
00:36:13,983 --> 00:36:15,409
Scott: I'm not asking for intersphere verse clan.

544
00:36:15,429 --> 00:36:15,770
Scott: That's dumb.

545
00:36:15,811 --> 00:36:17,009
Scott: I just want to see clan verse clan.

546
00:36:17,351 --> 00:36:22,345
Scott: Let me get my arrow for my ultra aces and whatnot for Gauss rifles.

547
00:36:22,626 --> 00:36:28,262
Scott: my you know, triple strength My embers and you know triple strength wasn't clan that we are PvP.

548
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:30,147
Rym: I just advanced intersphere.

549
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:35,598
Scott: I don't know whatever targeting computer is All the good stuff there.

550
00:36:35,638 --> 00:36:40,939
Rym: I saw some screenshots of like gyros and stuff in this game Mmm, I think you can get that in the campaign.

551
00:36:41,341 --> 00:36:44,093
Rym: Anyway, I have not played the game enough yet Like I like.

552
00:36:44,114 --> 00:36:45,399
Scott: yeah, I have not played it enough.

553
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,031
Rym: I played it a lot, but I haven't played it enough Right.

554
00:36:48,051 --> 00:36:48,794
Scott: So here's the thing is like.

555
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:54,438
Scott: the game like on the one hand is so good and that yes It is tabletop battle tech.

556
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:57,632
Scott: you take your turns you move your mechs you shoot, you know If you it's.

557
00:36:57,873 --> 00:37:00,204
Scott: the fundamental concepts are all the same.

558
00:37:00,224 --> 00:37:03,017
Scott: we take damage to areas Right areas.

559
00:37:03,077 --> 00:37:08,078
Scott: your arm falls off you can walk up to someone and melee them You can step on a vehicle and it gets destroyed.

560
00:37:08,118 --> 00:37:14,361
Scott: the fact that DFA is there like DFA real easy Like, you know all the weapons, you know work the same.

561
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:19,610
Scott: you can have someone's spot for your LRM fire You can you know you get a cover if you're in the woods.

562
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:22,654
Rym: In fact, my only complaint about the game I only like mechanical.

563
00:37:22,694 --> 00:37:27,790
Rym: complaint about this game is that they implemented this hardpoint system and met customization.

564
00:37:28,011 --> 00:37:28,814
Scott: Oh that I don't like.

565
00:37:28,834 --> 00:37:29,636
Scott: that is actually.

566
00:37:29,656 --> 00:37:52,540
Scott: there are many things that they've changed from the actual tabletop rules but a lot of the things they've changed are functionally equivalent or similar enough for like the exact roles and math for like falling over aren't exactly the same but it's effectively the same kind of thing where it's like yeah, if you moved a lot and then you get bumped a lot then your odds Of falling over increase and then you fall over,

567
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,886
Rym: you know, you've moved a lot.

568
00:37:53,906 --> 00:37:54,830
Rym: So you're harder to hit.

569
00:37:54,911 --> 00:37:56,783
Rym: It's a much it's a very in the woods.

570
00:37:56,844 --> 00:37:57,710
Scott: It's harder to hit you.

571
00:37:57,931 --> 00:38:03,710
Rym: It's harder to hit and the game is a really good job of really streamlining the heuristics and indicators and artifacts around that.

572
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:12,404
Rym: So like the further your guy moves and depending on the things that happen It'll show these little chevrons that show how much evasion you accumulated.

573
00:38:12,444 --> 00:38:12,605
Rym: It's not.

574
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,350
Rym: it's a really intuitive system, right?

575
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:18,310
Scott: There's not just piloting skill and gunning skill which would used to be just like two numbers.

576
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:26,278
Scott: Yeah now like four different stats that like grit and something else and like you can Level up your characters and to like get different.

577
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:29,309
Rym: you never played battle tech as a campaign though.

578
00:38:29,329 --> 00:38:29,630
Scott: That's well.

579
00:38:29,771 --> 00:38:31,450
Scott: No, that's messy mech warrior.

580
00:38:31,492 --> 00:38:42,588
Scott: Yeah the RPG has some of that stuff but battle tech as a campaign is Basically just playing the battle tech tabletop game that we played But linking the missions together and having money.

581
00:38:42,608 --> 00:38:46,121
Scott: now The other thing that is missing and having a store and having a story is.

582
00:38:46,362 --> 00:38:54,929
Rym: there's a deeper level of fiddly mech Customization that is not present and that is the things like what engine did you put in the Mac, right?

583
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:55,973
Scott: So they don't allow.

584
00:38:55,993 --> 00:39:02,637
Scott: they only allow customizing the mech to the way that mech warrior 2 allowed customizing the mech But actually even more restrictive.

585
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:05,690
Scott: because what they've done is like Rym was saying they these hard points.

586
00:39:05,851 --> 00:39:11,330
Scott: So usually in mech warrior 2 or in battle tech on pen and paper You could just you have these slots on the Mac.

587
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:17,399
Scott: You have a lot of them and you can put whatever you want in there that you can fit Without running out of slots or running out of weight.

588
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:20,310
Scott: in this one the mechs have these hard points.

589
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,059
Scott: So it's like okay.

590
00:39:21,201 --> 00:39:29,480
Scott: on this mech The left torso can hold one missile weapon and the right torso can hold two Ballistic weapons and the arms can hold two lasers.

591
00:39:29,561 --> 00:39:31,850
Scott: each or each Mac has like a different loadout.

592
00:39:32,112 --> 00:39:34,692
Rym: I wouldn't even be that butter about it If it.

593
00:39:34,933 --> 00:39:40,199
Rym: if it was if they were like there were a mix that a lot of hard points It was just the next have so few hard points.

594
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:43,190
Scott: You basically cannot customize much at all.

595
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:44,525
Scott: You just need to get a different Mac.

596
00:39:44,687 --> 00:39:50,270
Scott: Yep Also, they're the way the game is structured which is a truth of battle tech.

597
00:39:50,411 --> 00:39:52,039
Scott: But is they tried this?

598
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:55,195
Scott: I think the hard points were an attempt to solve this problem But didn't solve it.

599
00:39:55,255 --> 00:39:57,809
Scott: is that it's just better to field heavier max?

600
00:39:58,385 --> 00:40:04,955
Scott: Yeah You're better off just putting the four heaviest mechs you can out in the field loaded with the most stuff Yep, and the LRMs are just better.

601
00:40:05,176 --> 00:40:09,790
Rym: like 180 ton Mac can kick the shit out of 250 or 60 ton max usually.

602
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:13,245
Scott: Yeah, I mean in battle tech the pen and paper your game without the hard points.

603
00:40:13,386 --> 00:40:21,359
Scott: It's like yeah, it's true Every hundred ton Mac may as well be the same as every other hundred ton Mac But I could make a 30 ton Mac.

604
00:40:21,379 --> 00:40:24,410
Rym: That was really fucking dangerous in the right circumstances.

605
00:40:24,651 --> 00:40:28,089
Scott: Sure, you know you look at your mission situation you make the right kind of deal, but that's it.

606
00:40:28,372 --> 00:40:37,673
Rym: This is this is where in the campaign Different tonnages have interesting uses and I actually feel like a light Mac that I set up to be a scout And I've done things.

607
00:40:38,155 --> 00:40:43,513
Rym: but in the in multiplayer, which is my main interest in this battle tech game There aren't.

608
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:48,590
Rym: there isn't yet like a scenario builder, so it just comes down to what's the tonnage?

609
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:53,947
Rym: We're gonna play with and we both field lances of appropriate tonnage, and it's and they're like.

610
00:40:53,987 --> 00:40:55,030
Rym: I can't make a scenario.

611
00:40:55,130 --> 00:41:00,969
Rym: There's no like customizer there yet, which in multiplayer can lead to a problem where?

612
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:06,290
Rym: And when Scott and I played for the first time the same thing that used to happen in our old battle tech days happen.

613
00:41:07,033 --> 00:41:15,090
Rym: We both set up our max in an optimal ambush position And then dickered around for like 20 minutes and neither one of us would commit our forces anywhere.

614
00:41:15,653 --> 00:41:17,242
Rym: Till eventually we were just like fuck it.

615
00:41:17,262 --> 00:41:18,248
Rym: Let's just play the game.

616
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:21,074
Rym: I Want to be able to build scenarios.

617
00:41:21,094 --> 00:41:26,470
Rym: I want to be able to build like or at least have scenarios that are more interesting for multiplayer.

618
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:30,841
Scott: So the thing is this game for all its you know.

619
00:41:31,001 --> 00:41:34,234
Scott: hey, I can now play a video game But it's battle tech.

620
00:41:34,314 --> 00:41:42,750
Scott: the turn-based game hooray has lots and lots of these tiny Issues that you can see complained about on the subreddit for this game and many other place.

621
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:56,195
Rym: But what I would analogize this to actually is when Civ 5 first came out It was real fun for like a month, and then it was tapped out and had a similar Breadth of problems.

622
00:41:56,335 --> 00:41:58,401
Scott: yeah, so this has tons and tons of tiny issues.

623
00:41:58,441 --> 00:42:01,450
Scott: for example some today the one I saw most recently.

624
00:42:01,792 --> 00:42:03,421
Scott: There was a mech standing on top of a building.

625
00:42:03,984 --> 00:42:07,722
Scott: somebody decided Hey Let me destroy this building and they destroyed it.

626
00:42:08,043 --> 00:42:11,598
Scott: the mech was then floating in air And then the mech was then standing on the ground.

627
00:42:11,638 --> 00:42:12,340
Scott: perfectly fine.

628
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:18,950
Scott: in pen and paper battle tech you take falling damage Which is severe as fuck and holy shit, but in this video game?

629
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:21,201
Rym: We just like nothing pointed out in the campaign.

630
00:42:21,543 --> 00:42:24,643
Rym: they moved a mech into a spot And then an event happened, and they were hosed.

631
00:42:24,683 --> 00:42:25,530
Rym: they just couldn't continue.

632
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:27,981
Scott: Yeah, little bugs there was some like there's.

633
00:42:28,021 --> 00:42:29,147
Scott: some missions were like.

634
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:30,974
Scott: you know vehicles Go too fast.

635
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:35,797
Scott: there's some like missions where you go in and there's just a million enemies that are super strong And it's like fuck you.

636
00:42:35,817 --> 00:42:36,402
Scott: so you might as well.

637
00:42:36,423 --> 00:42:37,230
Scott: Just run away.

638
00:42:38,812 --> 00:42:40,318
Scott: You know there's like tons of like.

639
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:41,743
Scott: you know I could go on and on.

640
00:42:41,763 --> 00:42:43,710
Scott: there's just you know the user interface problems.

641
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:47,470
Scott: We're like you're trying to click on a thing, but actually you've moved your mech by accident.

642
00:42:48,931 --> 00:42:51,179
Rym: It's hard to get the angle of my view just right.

643
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:52,966
Scott: some you have the camera is not the greatest.

644
00:42:53,026 --> 00:42:54,576
Scott: also the a lot of The maps.

645
00:42:54,616 --> 00:42:57,416
Scott: everything is dark And it's hard to see what's going on.

646
00:42:57,717 --> 00:43:01,250
Scott: the mechs don't look distinct enough because they're sort of blending into the background.

647
00:43:01,653 --> 00:43:04,209
Scott: They're camo you know so it's like it's hard to even see.

648
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:05,774
Rym: But I just want to be clear.

649
00:43:06,457 --> 00:43:10,529
Rym: the game's still real fun and as a 1.0 like a released game.

650
00:43:10,549 --> 00:43:15,677
Rym: if This if they're able to invest in this game I mean the fact the game actually launched.

651
00:43:15,697 --> 00:43:17,202
Scott: kick-starting games is like usually.

652
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:18,788
Scott: it's just like they run away with your fucking money.

653
00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:36,226
Rym: if this game gets DLC Over time even in DLC expensive DLC even free clan DLC even just guy like I'm talking like the civilization levels of DLC I Would buy it all.

654
00:43:38,053 --> 00:43:39,258
Scott: Yeah, I mean the thing.

655
00:43:39,298 --> 00:43:42,430
Rym: you'll see that adds like the advanced tech so I can have my Gauss rifle.

656
00:43:43,093 --> 00:43:47,270
Scott: Yeah, my main problem is like I played the single-player and like the campaign.

657
00:43:47,672 --> 00:43:50,290
Scott: There's lots of stuff like you get a manage the mechs in the mech bay.

658
00:43:50,531 --> 00:43:53,302
Rym: It's real fun because it evokes old xcom.

659
00:43:53,783 --> 00:43:54,165
Rym: well.

660
00:43:54,205 --> 00:43:55,490
Scott: It's from mech warrior mercenaries.

661
00:43:55,490 --> 00:44:01,805
Rym: Yeah, you're managing your money, and I really enjoy that because shit sucks your things are always broken down Everyone's always hurt.

662
00:44:01,886 --> 00:44:02,130
Rym: you're like.

663
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:10,725
Scott: But the thing is there's a lot of fiddly issues like I'm trying to allocate tons of armor on my mech And it's like forty nine point seven seven and it won't let me make it exactly fifty.

664
00:44:10,766 --> 00:44:11,970
Scott: and then I go to start a mission.

665
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:15,664
Scott: It's like warning you're not using all the tonnage on your mech, and I'm like who's fucking fault is that?

666
00:44:15,764 --> 00:44:17,614
Scott: forty nine point nine nine ton?

667
00:44:17,795 --> 00:44:23,289
Rym: asshole granted right Making mechs repeatedly on pen and paper at similar issues.

668
00:44:24,112 --> 00:44:31,549
Rym: I never had an issue of point oh one tons missing, but I had issues of little fiddly details like that And usually we just ignored them, so it didn't matter.

669
00:44:32,581 --> 00:44:40,300
Scott: But yeah You know there's this Problems like you've got to repair a mech and it cost more on if you do it from one screen on the other screen and Oh, yeah, and you gotta wait.

670
00:44:40,481 --> 00:44:42,419
Scott: You know for the mech to actually repairs That's it.

671
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:48,990
Rym: There's definitely some problems now in the the economy of how long on the one screen.

672
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:50,458
Scott: It's like how much of the salvage worked.

673
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:52,590
Scott: oh like three million space bucks.

674
00:44:52,671 --> 00:44:53,989
Scott: And then you go to the screen to sell it.

675
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:57,310
Scott: It's like you can't sell it, and then it's like it's not actually worth jack shit.

676
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:59,129
Rym: It's like what the hell because you got to finish it.

677
00:44:59,250 --> 00:44:59,933
Rym: It's not like stay.

678
00:44:59,953 --> 00:45:06,681
Scott: why can't I sell that if a piece of a mech is worth that much and then when I do finish it The full mech is worth less than the it said the part was worth.

679
00:45:06,701 --> 00:45:09,673
Scott: You know and they got this reputation system Confused

680
00:45:09,694 --> 00:45:21,549
Rym: but also it's sparse in that head like it's fun, but You do end up just hitting play and letting like 40 days go by Because you're waiting for like all your mechs to repair and stuff like

681
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:23,908
Scott: yeah Why would I do the next mission before my mixer repair?

682
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:24,029
Rym: yep?

683
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:28,147
Rym: So the economy of action in the single-player campaign type.

684
00:45:28,207 --> 00:45:33,695
Scott: you're starting everyone There's scarters starting scout dies, so I'm like my starting scout guy didn't die I'm doing died.

685
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:35,725
Scott: I go to the subreddit and everyone's like Decker.

686
00:45:35,765 --> 00:45:36,630
Scott: He always dies.

687
00:45:36,911 --> 00:45:39,480
Rym: I don't know how they could have him die.

688
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:49,167
Scott: I like blew through that mission, and then I immediately do well No, I mean he's your scouting guy for like the whole many yeah for the beginning of the game You just keep him around right and then the next mission.

689
00:45:49,227 --> 00:45:49,549
Scott: I did.

690
00:45:50,673 --> 00:45:51,198
Scott: He just got.

691
00:45:51,299 --> 00:45:51,904
Scott: he was perfect.

692
00:45:51,965 --> 00:45:52,530
Scott: perfect health.

693
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:53,434
Scott: He hadn't been hit yet.

694
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:57,230
Scott: a mech just walks over to him comes out of the fog and fires like a million.

695
00:45:57,351 --> 00:45:59,520
Scott: He dies instantly, but that is battle tech.

696
00:45:59,701 --> 00:46:01,729
Scott: right, but then I loaded the game so he didn't die.

697
00:46:02,652 --> 00:46:04,802
Scott: But everyone else is like this guy keeps dying.

698
00:46:04,863 --> 00:46:06,330
Rym: I'm playing hardcore in all consequences.

699
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:07,458
Rym: I never back out of a fight.

700
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:07,941
Scott: Well.

701
00:46:07,981 --> 00:46:09,250
Scott: I mean why not load a save game?

702
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:12,464
Scott: Oh, also if you have too many save games the game starts to slow down.

703
00:46:12,484 --> 00:46:13,590
Scott: You have to delete your save games.

704
00:46:14,892 --> 00:46:19,162
Scott: Yeah, so Basically, I got you know I played the single-player until I was like.

705
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:20,809
Scott: some of the missions are so samey.

706
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:24,990
Scott: That's where I feel like I don't care about the plot enough to see the rest of it.

707
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:25,941
Scott: I could watch it on YouTube.

708
00:46:25,961 --> 00:46:29,690
Scott: so now I'm pretty much just only waiting for like people who want to play multiplayer.

709
00:46:29,931 --> 00:46:34,073
Scott: But I feel like that's where the sweet spot is gonna be kind of like Civ 5.

710
00:46:34,073 --> 00:46:35,890
Rym: The sweet spot is multiplayer.

711
00:46:36,931 --> 00:46:48,730
Rym: until there's a DLC that adds something to the game and that as long as they do continue to invest in this game and release Content and improve it then there will definitely be a cycle of play the game with people in multiplayer.

712
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:53,550
Rym: It starts to get tapped out some content comes in we jump back on the single-player train.

713
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:57,819
Scott: You know whenever we're in a battle tech mood We can actually play a battle tech now without having to bust.

714
00:46:57,859 --> 00:46:59,324
Rym: so I would say cardboard.

715
00:46:59,464 --> 00:47:12,699
Rym: if you are in the situation We're in where you have fond memories of old pen and paper battle tech But don't have time to play it buy this game The even if you only play the campaign and play it multiplayer a few times It'll scratch that if you're

716
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,750
Scott: expecting the exact same rules.

717
00:47:15,151 --> 00:47:16,456
Scott: This is not that for exam.

718
00:47:16,476 --> 00:47:19,769
Rym: you know like I never 100% knew the rules back then.

719
00:47:19,869 --> 00:47:22,073
Scott: anyway I know I know the rules But how to present?

720
00:47:22,134 --> 00:47:29,770
Scott: for example the biggest rule change is that in paid pen and paper battle tech right everyone moves Then everyone shoots, and you all shoot simultaneously.

721
00:47:29,951 --> 00:47:31,255
Scott: So I get a headshot on Rym.

722
00:47:31,556 --> 00:47:45,040
Scott: He still might get a headshot on me before he dies right whereas in this There's initiatives more like X come so the fast makes go first unless they delay And then the next Mexico and they move shoot move shoot Which is more what you're used to in a turn-based strategy video game.

723
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:45,923
Scott: right like advance wars.

724
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:47,047
Scott: move shoot move shoot right.

725
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:53,290
Scott: so In that sense you could just like destroy a mech before it even gets a chance to do anything if you get lucky right?

726
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:54,776
Scott: Yeah, which is not the same.

727
00:47:54,937 --> 00:47:56,725
Rym: Yeah, yeah, you go with that on purpose.

728
00:47:56,746 --> 00:47:57,690
Rym: You set up stress.

729
00:47:58,813 --> 00:48:00,570
Scott: It's fine right there's nothing wrong with it.

730
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:04,185
Scott: I'm just saying if you're expecting it to be exactly the same it is not.

731
00:48:04,325 --> 00:48:07,289
Scott: it is just the same Feel and mostly the same.

732
00:48:07,672 --> 00:48:19,450
