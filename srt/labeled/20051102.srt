00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,507
Scott: It's Wednesday November 2nd.

2
00:00:11,627 --> 00:00:15,080
Scott: This is GeekNights with Rym and Scott mostly Scott.

3
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,214
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:19,274 --> 00:00:19,918
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:20,702
Scott: All right.

6
00:00:21,024 --> 00:00:26,749
Scott: Yeah, so I Got to the train station this morning looked at my cell phone and it said one voicemail.

7
00:00:27,252 --> 00:00:30,990
Scott: My cell phone really sucks at telling me when this voicemail doesn't make noise or anything.

8
00:00:31,393 --> 00:00:33,470
Rym: Ah, I've told my phone to make a noise and it makes a noise.

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,130
Scott: I tried then I immediately looked to see how I could tell my phone to make a noise.

10
00:00:37,853 --> 00:00:40,286
Scott: I couldn't find how to tell it to make a noise in a voicemail.

11
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:41,029
Scott: I don't think it can.

12
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,455
Scott: So the voicemails my dad.

13
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:48,230
Scott: so I check it and he says call me which is real informative.

14
00:00:48,491 --> 00:00:58,150
Rym: yeah, I hate it when people do that because that always means either something bad happened and they didn't want to tell you in voicemail or They're just stupid and they're not informative enough in their voicemails.

15
00:00:58,292 --> 00:00:59,670
Scott: It's the second one anyway.

16
00:01:00,071 --> 00:01:05,950
Scott: So I go and I try to call him and he he doesn't turn his cell phone on or keep it on his person.

17
00:01:06,392 --> 00:01:09,644
Scott: Great, so I got immediately dumped to his voicemail.

18
00:01:10,407 --> 00:01:11,050
Rym: Did you leave a?

19
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:13,643
Rym: No, you should have no.

20
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:16,655
Scott: so Eventually later in the day.

21
00:01:16,675 --> 00:01:27,207
Scott: He picked up the phone right and he's like, oh you call me now I'm like Supposed to know that it was a timely call, you know, what the hell he's like.

22
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:38,590
Scott: apparently He got locked out of the house And I have a key to his house and he would have wanted me to come open it.

23
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:43,115
Scott: Now just the other day, yeah I do distinctly recall.

24
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:57,250
Scott: now it made me realize that I would have had to go and Open the house because I expect them to come open this house if by some Terrible accident we lock ourselves out because I did notice that the other day we were talking about just this.

25
00:01:57,551 --> 00:02:00,410
Rym: Yeah, and I said, what would you do if you locked yourself out?

26
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,966
Rym: And you said I just call my daddy and he'd come and open the door.

27
00:02:03,986 --> 00:02:08,288
Scott: Yep But now I guess I have to do the same thing the other way.

28
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,361
Rym: Yeah, it's great that I don't have to do.

29
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,094
Scott: I should have said I didn't have a key to his house But no, I do.

30
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,869
Rym: Yeah, I do, but he probably knows you have it.

31
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:18,279
Scott: Well, he wasn't 100% sure you.

32
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:22,118
Scott: that's why he asked me if I had one But I wasn't gonna lie and I lie.

33
00:02:22,138 --> 00:02:26,947
Rym: Yeah, so if you had accidentally answered your phone You would have been stuck driving to Connecticut instead of going to work.

34
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,214
Scott: No, it would have been last night.

35
00:02:29,595 --> 00:02:30,859
Scott: The voicemail was last night.

36
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:33,328
Scott: Ah, I just didn't see it till this morning.

37
00:02:33,348 --> 00:02:35,716

00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,502
Rym: what was your mom or your sister?

39
00:02:37,562 --> 00:02:39,789
Scott: my mom isn't the stupid basket tour thing or me.

40
00:02:40,331 --> 00:02:41,456
Scott: Maybe she got back already.

41
00:02:41,737 --> 00:02:42,118
Scott: I don't know.

42
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:46,214
Scott: I don't know the story with that your mom in those baskets But her birthday's next week.

50
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,630
Rym: I did work but it was a lot of like install a thing on a server.

51
00:03:07,132 --> 00:03:12,550
Rym: So I'd state do the install do all the configs and then I wait for like 20 minutes while it firefight.

52
00:03:14,691 --> 00:03:22,439
Rym: So anyway, there's actually a lot of fairly interesting big news today, oh really oh, yes, really really Oh, really?

Rym: Yeah, really?

54
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,207
Rym: So apparently the CIA is running gulags in Eastern Europe.

55
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:35,120
Scott: We knew that Yeah, but now the government knows that And now the government international knows it.

56
00:03:35,361 --> 00:03:36,868
Rym: now the government admits that it knows it.

57
00:03:37,892 --> 00:03:39,496
Scott: Well, if you admit you're doing bad.

58
00:03:39,557 --> 00:03:43,127
Scott: doesn't that also kind of also mean we're gonna stop doing it.

59
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,217
Rym: I Don't think so.

60
00:03:45,277 --> 00:03:48,074
Rym: That's not what I was led to believe by these Articles about.

61
00:03:48,114 --> 00:03:49,419
Scott: it can't say you're doing something.

62
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:50,302
Scott: You know is bad.

63
00:03:50,382 --> 00:03:58,728
Rym: Not only did they not stop doing it They refer to them as quote black sites Because that's not an evil name at all.

64
00:04:00,153 --> 00:04:01,929
Rym: They don't call them anything like the puppy factory.

65
00:04:02,211 --> 00:04:09,109
Scott: What do you what if I'm a company and and all of a sudden I come out and I say, yeah, we've got these death camps?

66
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:14,523
Scott: And then they say oh, I guess you you've come out and you're gonna stop death camping.

67
00:04:14,563 --> 00:04:15,927
Scott: No, actually we're gonna keep them going.

68
00:04:16,809 --> 00:04:18,741
Rym: Oh It isn't better.

69
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:22,630
Rym: the Washington Post Knows where all these camps are located.

70
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:34,390
Rym: They have chosen not to reveal this information to the public at the request of a senior US official Because the disclosure might quote disrupt counterterrorism efforts in those countries and elsewhere.

71
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:37,907
Scott: Well, we just know now not to read the Washington Post cuz they're a bunch of pussies.

72
00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:38,510
Rym: Yeah.

73
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:50,662
Rym: Yeah, though, uh from all the rumor-mongering it seems like Most of them are in former Soviet territories and they're actually former gulags like really Old abandoned prisons and stuff.

74
00:04:50,843 --> 00:04:51,969
Scott: How can you do something bad?

75
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:57,269
Scott: Usually you admit it and then you stop Keep doing it because they didn't really admit it.

76
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,410
Rym: It's other people found out and they don't know what to do about that.

77
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:05,246
Rym: You close them and you at the minimum you can't close them cuz.

78
00:05:05,366 --> 00:05:09,066
Scott: uh at the minimum You say you closed them and you keep them open.

79
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:14,528
Rym: Come on You gotta at least look like you're trying because if they say they closed them, that's admitting that they had him.

80
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:17,698
Scott: They already admitted they had him or beyond that.

81
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,083
Rym: not really.

82
00:05:19,183 --> 00:05:21,530
Rym: they just said don't talk about it.

83
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,776
Scott: Right then you don't you do?

84
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:25,068
Scott: you say they don't exist and you move them.

85
00:05:26,691 --> 00:05:33,416
Rym: yeah, see the thing is the CIA will not acknowledge the details of its system and They acknowledge the existence of the system.

86
00:05:33,436 --> 00:05:34,620
Rym: It's not really.

87
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,770
Rym: it's complicated and no one's really everyone's kind of just going.

88
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:40,900
Scott: But if they didn't acknowledge the existence of the system, how do we know?

89
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,846
Scott: It's not just some bullshit made up by the newspaper.

90
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:44,535
Rym: Uh Don't know.

91
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:45,910
Scott: Oh, that's great.

92
00:05:47,988 --> 00:05:48,893
Rym: Oh Apparently they were.

93
00:05:49,073 --> 00:05:54,532
Rym: well this may much have admitted it because apparently they were conceived in the couple months after September 11.

94
00:05:54,532 --> 00:06:03,686
Rym: Oh fine, if they admitted it then everything I said before yeah, but they're oh, oh They're claiming that they aren't illegal and that they're part of the war on terror and that they need him.

95
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:04,830
Scott: I'm killing this guy.

96
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,675
Scott: It's all right.

97
00:06:05,977 --> 00:06:07,023
Scott: It's part of the war on terror.

98
00:06:07,043 --> 00:06:07,989
Scott: I thought he was a terrorist.

99
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:10,296
Rym: Britain got away with that dude.

100
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:13,790
Scott: The police will come here one morning and be like you killed your roommate of like his terrorist.

101
00:06:14,913 --> 00:06:15,599
Rym: That might work.

102
00:06:16,023 --> 00:06:16,710
Scott: it's kind of scary.

103
00:06:16,771 --> 00:06:26,233
Rym: Yeah the fact that I'm more afraid of being shot or harassed by my own police department or my own government that I am of Actual terrorists.

104
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:31,629
Scott: and it's not even that I'm afraid that they'll get me because I do something terrorist like.

105
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,153
Rym: no It's just.

106
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:33,510
Rym: I'm afraid they'll just get me I'll be walking.

107
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:38,710
Scott: I'm afraid that they'll just you know, think of a terrorist randomly just by accident or whatever.

108
00:06:41,523 --> 00:06:41,763
Scott: They know.

109
00:06:41,783 --> 00:06:43,530
Scott: I'm not doing anything terrorist for real.

110
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,500
Rym: yeah, no not everything bad is happening in the u.s.

111
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,160
Rym: This time there's riots in multiple countries that most people don't know about.

112
00:06:50,963 --> 00:06:56,545
Scott: I can't believe it didn't know that there were riots in Paris for like a week like a week and no There's no one burned.

113
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:57,711
Scott: I read Google News.

114
00:06:58,052 --> 00:06:59,800
Rym: Yeah, Google News had a blurb at the bottom.

115
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:00,242
Rym: I didn't.

116
00:07:00,282 --> 00:07:07,826
Rym: I didn't even see it because I have a like European Union Google News section and this came and menacing.

118
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:14,260

119
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:18,434
Rym: In one night over 180 vehicles were torched.

Rym: Well, it's still going on and no one knows how to deal with it.

124
00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:47,894
Rym: some of the right-wingers in the government are calling for Various military groups to just kind of storm through the suburbs and subdue anyone on the street.

125
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:54,030
Scott: It's what you get for being racist Yeah, and what's the other word Zeno folks anaphobia?

126
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,795
Rym: Yeah, something like that little xenophobia.

127
00:07:55,815 --> 00:07:57,540
Scott: Oh, we are these enough.

128
00:07:57,741 --> 00:08:08,196
Rym: Oh, I mean France has the largest Muslim population of any Western nation yet They seem to be the one of the most racist about Muslims, well, you know Germany.

129
00:08:08,276 --> 00:08:14,454
Scott: they had a ton of Jews there And they didn't like them because the Jews are doing good BAM Goodwin.

130
00:08:14,915 --> 00:08:15,256
Rym: Okay.

131
00:08:15,778 --> 00:08:16,200
Scott: All right.

132
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:18,317
Rym: So where else was there rioting?

133
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,831
Rym: Ethiopia Ethiopia that wonderful paragon of civilization.

134
00:08:22,891 --> 00:08:26,823
Scott: Ethiopia is pretty good compared to some other African countries like Rwanda.

135
00:08:27,104 --> 00:08:29,775
Rym: Ethiopia was very nice until various things screwed it up.

136
00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:30,437
Scott: It's still.

137
00:08:30,497 --> 00:08:31,160
Scott: it's still okay.

138
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:44,429
Scott: it's okay, but what happened was at an election and this guy won the guy who was favored by Bush and such and favored by Blair and So all the people were like it was rigged.

139
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,473
Scott: It was rigged.

140
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:47,420
Rym: All right, was it rigged?

141
00:08:48,082 --> 00:08:48,526
Scott: We don't know.

142
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:52,378
Scott: probably not great But anyway, what did the people do?

143
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,700
Scott: Unlike fat-ass Americans who sit around when it's obviously rigged and do nothing.

144
00:08:58,628 --> 00:09:09,050
Scott: They rioted and they're still rioting and I Think whether it was rigged or not the guy who's in charge who won the election.

145
00:09:09,752 --> 00:09:11,316
Scott: He put the opposition party in jail.

146
00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:19,600
Rym: Oh See up until you said that I was thinking alright, so the people are rioting but it might not be rigged.

147
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:29,538
Rym: They might just not just be overreacting but damn Yeah, imagine if after the 2004 election Bush has been like, alright, Terry Dean jail.

148
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:37,865
Rym: Yeah Way to kill the momentum by getting a call on your cell phone and making me pause it.

149
00:09:38,608 --> 00:09:42,059
Rym: Yeah You know, you could have just ignored the cell phone.

150
00:09:42,802 --> 00:09:46,454
Rym: I don't want to but uh Why we were doing something?

151
00:09:47,237 --> 00:09:51,970
Scott: cell phones more important than doing something because I didn't know who was calling.

152
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:53,195
Scott: Yeah, I did.

153
00:09:53,616 --> 00:09:54,420
Rym: How could you've known?

154
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,769
Scott: my mom just called and then she called again.

155
00:09:57,674 --> 00:10:00,370
Rym: How about when your mom called and you cut off the podcast?

156
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,530
Rym: They don't need to know that there were two phone calls in the interim.

157
00:10:04,093 --> 00:10:05,178
Scott: Well now they do so.

158
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:18,169
Scott: now there won't be any deception by you Uh-huh, as to the number of phone calls there were Because I could really benefit from falsifying such a wonderful and useful information you do all the time.

159
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,184
Rym: Yeah, yeah, so, uh, yeah, Ethiopia.

160
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:25,019
Rym: Oh Wonderful, though.

161
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:25,943
Rym: There was some cool news.

162
00:10:26,003 --> 00:10:30,549
Scott: apparently Denver, Colorado Legalized marijuana, did they actually pass a law that says so?

163
00:10:31,491 --> 00:10:37,857
Rym: Passed a measure that makes it legal for residents over the age of 21 to possess up to an option or ounce of marijuana To possess.

164
00:10:38,118 --> 00:10:39,569
Scott: Yeah, what about to sell?

165
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:46,990
Rym: They can sell less than an ounce so they can still get dealers, but they can't get people who just have some marijuana.

166
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,094
Rym: hmm and Oregon isn't.

167
00:10:51,134 --> 00:10:57,130
Scott: if they doesn't someone just have to say hey your town law can't conflict with state law because it can conflict.

168
00:10:57,471 --> 00:11:01,309
Rym: All this means that now it's only a violation of state and federal law.

169
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:08,810
Rym: So Denver told the state police that yeah, if the state police of Colorado want to enforce their stupid drug laws.

170
00:11:09,354 --> 00:11:13,856
Rym: They're gonna have to send state troopers down here and do it themselves Because our cops aren't gonna.

171
00:11:13,977 --> 00:11:14,941
Scott: but isn't it also?

172
00:11:14,982 --> 00:11:20,269
Scott: but I mean if you're gonna do it that way Right, if you look at like look at a state like Connecticut, right?

173
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,370
Scott: Yeah, the town of Trumbull that I lived in doesn't have a law that says murders is illegal.

174
00:11:26,771 --> 00:11:28,657
Scott: The state has a law that says murder.

175
00:11:28,777 --> 00:11:30,242
Scott: is you know all the murder crap, right?

176
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:34,509
Scott: Yeah, so if you murder someone in, Connecticut It's a violation of state law.

177
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:37,279
Scott: It is indeed a violation of state law and state law only.

178
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:40,850
Scott: but the town cops arrest you because you broke a state law.

179
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,698
Scott: They don't have to send state troopers to get you.

180
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:45,129
Rym: the town cops don't have to though and they won't know.

181
00:11:45,651 --> 00:11:47,398
Rym: Well, they don't have to and they won't know.

182
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:49,252
Rym: they don't Really?

183
00:11:49,614 --> 00:11:50,437
Scott: Oh, really?

184
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,562
Rym: Yeah, really?

185
00:11:51,582 --> 00:11:53,490
Scott: Yeah, I did not know this.

186
00:11:54,192 --> 00:12:01,090
Scott: I thought that pretty much, you know, it's like federalism federal law state law town law all above laws apply below.

187
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:05,522
Rym: Yeah, but apparently the town is gonna say screw you we did something.

188
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:08,765
Scott: but I mean is right town a beacon doesn't have a no marijuana law.

189
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:10,593
Rym: Yeah, what if it did?

190
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:16,309
Scott: Oh if it did you'd go to jail for breaking town law and breaking state law and then whatever.

191
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:20,370
Rym: but yeah No, they passed a law of saying specifically it is not illegal and specific.

192
00:12:21,192 --> 00:12:24,320
Scott: But then but then doesn't that conflict with the state law?

193
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:26,525
Scott: yes, and this isn't the law illegal?

194
00:12:26,786 --> 00:12:28,250
Rym: no, it's stupid.

195
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:32,484
Scott: Basically if your law in a town conflicts it does state law is.

196
00:12:33,046 --> 00:12:36,762
Rym: it's a political move Because they believe that marijuana shouldn't be illegal.

197
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:38,530
Scott: Oh, that's a political move is fine.

198
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,043
Scott: But and the law is gonna be thrown out real soon.

199
00:12:41,063 --> 00:12:41,727
Rym: Maybe maybe not.

200
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:42,972
Scott: What do you mean?

201
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:43,394
Scott: Maybe not.

202
00:12:43,434 --> 00:12:47,346
Scott: if a state makes a law that directly conflicts of the federal law.

203
00:12:47,447 --> 00:12:48,330
Scott: Yeah, it just goes away.

204
00:12:50,485 --> 00:12:53,881
Rym: Not Always it has to get to a federal court first.

205
00:12:54,282 --> 00:12:56,550
Scott: Oh, yeah, but I mean this will go to a state court.

206
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,479
Scott: What do you think's gonna win in the state court?

207
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,046
Scott: for they win the state involved?

208
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:00,770
Scott: It's their court.

209
00:13:00,871 --> 00:13:02,790
Rym: Well, the state hasn't said they're gonna do anything at all.

210
00:13:04,172 --> 00:13:07,650
Scott: Well, if the state lets it fly then that basically invalidates the state law.

211
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,363
Rym: I mean the most is it's not the state laws not enforced can do because you can't.

212
00:13:11,784 --> 00:13:14,418
Rym: it's not against the law to not Enforce the law.

213
00:13:14,942 --> 00:13:15,930
Scott: no, that's correct.

214
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:23,890
Rym: so the only thing the state can do is send state troopers in to go after people with an ounce of marijuana and Get them and that's fine.

215
00:13:24,612 --> 00:13:27,764
Rym: But the local cops in Denver don't have to do jack anymore and they won't.

216
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:33,150
Rym: that's fine Yeah, so it's never gonna hit the courts because there's no chance for it to hit the courts.

217
00:13:34,351 --> 00:13:39,430
Rym: It's not illegal for the local cops to not enforce a law that isn't on their books.

218
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:44,649
Scott: But some guy can just go make file some papers in court and then there'll be a thing about it.

219
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:48,849
Rym: You can't file in court unless there has been a damage to you.

220
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:49,833
Scott: Well, you can.

221
00:13:49,893 --> 00:13:51,779
Scott: you can file suit against the.

222
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,327
Scott: the state can try to sue the town for what.

223
00:13:54,347 --> 00:13:57,629
Rym: there has to be a damage And they have to prove for damaging the state's laws.

224
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,333
Rym: That's tricky.

225
00:13:59,353 --> 00:14:01,662
Rym: You have to prove tort and it's not that easy.

226
00:14:01,722 --> 00:14:05,857
Rym: People do this kind of crap all the time Yeah, and they usually get thrown out immediately.

227
00:14:05,897 --> 00:14:09,812
Rym: if you don't have tort you can't even sue they just yeah But you know what?

228
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:16,729
Scott: There are lawyers who know what they're talking about who are smarter than us that are working on it right now Yeah, and you know what the town's probably gonna win because no one cares.

229
00:14:17,352 --> 00:14:23,661
Scott: Yeah, but I mean if the state doesn't enforce it you can then you can argue in court They didn't enforce the law might as well not exist.

230
00:14:23,842 --> 00:14:24,907
Rym: Yeah, that might be their goal.

231
00:14:24,928 --> 00:14:35,761
Scott: We don't know I like that kind of thing but I Really don't think we should start a trend of town laws overriding state laws because you know next lot Nazi town You know what?

232
00:14:35,822 --> 00:14:36,250
Rym: That's fine.

233
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:40,061
Rym: Cuz I'll just move on a Nazi town and the Nazi people can live in their crappy little Nazi town.

234
00:14:40,903 --> 00:14:45,494
Rym: Yeah federalism Godwin, too We're on a roll.

235
00:14:45,614 --> 00:14:47,300
Scott: I'm going for Godwin like five.

236
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:47,641
Scott: All right.

237
00:14:47,681 --> 00:14:48,744
Rym: All right Godwin this one.

238
00:14:49,085 --> 00:14:57,170
Scott: So, uh the Microsoft Live debut Windows wouldn't exist if IBM didn't make computers and sell the Nazis.

239
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,119
Rym: IBM didn't make computers to sell the Nazis.

240
00:15:01,661 --> 00:15:02,965
Scott: They did way back in the day.

241
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,310
Rym: There weren't computers?

242
00:15:04,711 --> 00:15:05,173
Scott: Yeah, there were.

243
00:15:05,314 --> 00:15:09,290
Scott: there were like enigma and there are machines of international business.

244
00:15:11,353 --> 00:15:14,730
Scott: There were computers, yeah, they're just really crappy and they're real big.

245
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:21,090
Rym: But anyway, so this is real reminiscent of the other famous Microsoft demo that failed in front of millions of people.

246
00:15:21,674 --> 00:15:23,608
Scott: Yeah, but see the thing is this one.

247
00:15:23,628 --> 00:15:35,610
Scott: actually while it's hilarious that it failed and Microsoft was very crap Oh and failing it failed because the internet connection they were using died and Also everyone who was there watching their wireless died.

248
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:45,250
Rym: so it obviously wasn't though two of the reporters who were there say that they think the demo died and then Microsoft made the wireless die so they couldn't blog about it right away.

249
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:58,416
Scott: The only two things that could be true that I could think of are number one Microsoft actually just lost the connection and those reporters are all Linux II and awesome maybe or they're right, which means aha Linux II and awesome either way.

250
00:15:58,436 --> 00:16:01,045
Rym: No one's gonna remember why it failed.

251
00:16:01,065 --> 00:16:02,670
Rym: They're just gonna remember that it failed.

252
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:04,557
Scott: Yeah, they're also gonna remember.

253
00:16:04,738 --> 00:16:07,930
Scott: I read one guy who actually you I think that's the article the one you're looking at.

254
00:16:08,431 --> 00:16:17,804
Scott: One of those guys is talking about actual Microsoft Live and not about the fact that it went down and he's like, yeah It's cool after you customize it a whole bunch.

255
00:16:17,884 --> 00:16:23,183
Scott: It's not immediately useful And it basically compared to Google's stuffs.

256
00:16:23,444 --> 00:16:24,267
Scott: That is equivalent.

257
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:25,927
Scott: It's poop Aha.

258
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:30,477
Scott: So yeah They finally come through on the.

259
00:16:30,497 --> 00:16:37,265
Scott: oh, we're gonna make it a web service instead of an application and it sucks All right, Nostradamus.

260
00:16:38,088 --> 00:16:39,873
Scott: I thought it was gonna be good if they actually did it.

261
00:16:40,014 --> 00:16:45,600
Scott: No, I pretty much assumed it wouldn't be Because I thought it would be just like an application only on the web.

262
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,800
Rym: But no people have been trying to do that for ever and they've done it successfully.

263
00:16:51,601 --> 00:16:53,007
Rym: Not for office suites.

264
00:16:53,147 --> 00:16:56,140
Scott: that is a word processor and there's a spreadsheet and they're both really good.

265
00:16:56,762 --> 00:17:04,271
Rym: They're not as good from a business perspective and by business I mean what people in businesses use word processors and spreadsheets for.

266
00:17:04,351 --> 00:17:06,458
Scott: if you slightly modified these things they would be.

267
00:17:06,478 --> 00:17:08,527
Scott: you just had to Make it so it.

268
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,330
Scott: you know.

269
00:17:09,632 --> 00:17:15,460
Rym: customize a little bit for your business Yeah, but keep in mind a lot of businesses use office suites in stupid ways.

270
00:17:16,282 --> 00:17:18,631
Scott: Oh, we're gonna use a spreadsheet to do something.

271
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:21,060
Scott: We should use Microsoft Access for but Microsoft Access sucks.

272
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:21,843
Scott: You should never use it.

273
00:17:22,104 --> 00:17:22,505
Scott: They're using.

274
00:17:22,726 --> 00:17:25,838
Scott: they're basically using Excel for something that is supposed to be using MySQL for.

275
00:17:26,138 --> 00:17:27,246
Rym: yeah Yeah, something like that.

276
00:17:27,266 --> 00:17:27,346
Rym: Yeah.

277
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:27,769
Rym: Yeah.

278
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:31,965
Scott: Oh I need to make a poster.

279
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:36,917
Scott: I'm gonna use Microsoft Word instead of I guess the modern equivalent of publisher.

280
00:17:37,318 --> 00:17:37,678
Rym: Yeah.

281
00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:38,200
Scott: Yeah.

282
00:17:44,805 --> 00:17:47,904
Rym: So my thing of the day Isn't so much?

283
00:17:48,185 --> 00:17:51,999
Rym: it's really just a Wikipedia article, but I thought it was cool and it amused me greatly at work.

284
00:17:52,901 --> 00:17:53,602
Scott: Wikipedia.

285
00:17:53,883 --> 00:18:02,429
Rym: it is a list of unusual deaths and it is just people who have died in unusual funny or interesting ways Throughout history, how unusual could it be?

286
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:03,735
Scott: I can't imagine a death.

287
00:18:03,776 --> 00:18:04,700
Scott: That's so strange.

288
00:18:04,847 --> 00:18:07,989
Rym: All right This one may not be true, but according to may not be true.

289
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:08,752
Scott: then what's the point?

290
00:18:08,812 --> 00:18:10,096
Rym: because accordingly in 207 BC?

291
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,508
Scott: How do we if it's 207 BC what the hell precipice.

292
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:19,900
Rym: some Greek philosopher died of laughter after seeing a donkey eating figs?

293
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,585
Scott: That's that's.

294
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,959
Rym: I move to ones that are definitely verified.

295
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:33,559
Rym: King Bela the first of Hungary died when his tall wooden throne collapsed because it was sabotaged by an assassin.

296
00:18:36,404 --> 00:18:39,407
Scott: He's an eye-chair And I got the legs out.

297
00:18:39,628 --> 00:18:39,749
Rym: Yeah.

298
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:42,780
Rym: Oh another one of the figs Matthew Corvin is a king of Hungary.

299
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,646
Rym: He died after eating a poisoned fig.

300
00:18:45,228 --> 00:18:53,294
Scott: I think someone sabotaged this thread this page with fig stories And I have a theory every theory hypothesis if you will.

301
00:18:54,478 --> 00:18:55,200
Scott: it's a hypothesis.

302
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,545
Rym: Here's a good one.

303
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:02,380
Rym: this conquistador was killed by having molten gold poured down his throat.

304
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,207
Scott: He probably wanted it to happen that way.

305
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:08,779
Scott: He's probably pull the gold down my throat then I can eat the hottest peppers.

306
00:19:09,701 --> 00:19:15,858
Rym: Tycho Brahe died of a bladder infection after refusing to leave for the bathroom during a banquet for the sake of good manners.

307
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,473
Rym: Oh No, no, no, it says that they've figured out later that.

308
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,940
Rym: no he just died of mercury poisoning?

309
00:19:22,001 --> 00:19:23,447
Scott: Never but he made he's still alive.

310
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:24,993
Scott: He makes comics and they're funny.

311
00:19:25,576 --> 00:19:27,360
Scott: Yeah Yeah.

312
00:19:28,342 --> 00:19:30,935
Rym: So yeah, it's a funny list and I could just sit here and read them all day.

313
00:19:30,975 --> 00:19:31,839
Scott: So let's not do that.

314
00:19:32,341 --> 00:19:35,311
Scott: so my funny thing of awesome of the day was a case.

315
00:19:35,352 --> 00:19:39,412
Scott: Western is a video floating around the net of A chemistry lecture.

316
00:19:39,776 --> 00:19:47,664
Scott: All right I think it was a Halloween chemistry lecture, but I don't think that matters and visit his teacher up front showing something about Chemical equilibrium.

317
00:19:47,704 --> 00:19:49,048
Scott: woman some reaction whatever.

318
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:50,511
Scott: Uh-huh and all of a sudden.

319
00:19:50,832 --> 00:19:55,743
Scott: Um, I don't know which ghost it is pinky blinky Pac-man.

320
00:19:55,823 --> 00:19:58,893
Scott: the blue pac-man ghost is about to be eaten the blue one.

321
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:01,040
Scott: Oh, they're all blue when they're about to be eaten.

322
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,330
Scott: so yeah, what about to be eaten?

323
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:07,329
Scott: one of unknown name comes in and Tells the teacher he's coming.

324
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:08,335
Scott: He's coming to get me.

325
00:20:08,395 --> 00:20:11,472
Scott: Oh my god You know, he ate the big pill.

326
00:20:11,593 --> 00:20:12,176
Scott: What am I gonna do?

327
00:20:12,196 --> 00:20:18,193
Scott: Right and The teachers just like haha leave you're you're funny with your pac-man ghost.

328
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:19,015
Scott: All right, get out of here.

329
00:20:19,296 --> 00:20:29,784
Scott: Yeah, and the pac-man comes and I was like, oh my god, and then pac-man chases him around of it and then chase him out of the room and Everyone there was.

330
00:20:29,804 --> 00:20:31,471
Scott: it was very entertained man.

331
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:33,600
Rym: I miss college and I miss hijinks like that.

332
00:20:33,962 --> 00:20:35,291
Scott: I miss that type of college hijinks.

333
00:20:35,332 --> 00:20:36,459
Rym: Nothing like that happens at work.

334
00:20:36,781 --> 00:20:39,960
Rym: There's no way I'd be sitting at work and someone dressed like pac-man would run through the car.

335
00:20:40,081 --> 00:20:46,110
Scott: It's a pretty good pac-man costume - nice and solid good shape Better than some of the ones I saw at Otakon.

336
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:51,779
Rym: Well, even some of those were good though I saw one really good one at Otakon because it was going up the escalator look like it was eating people.

337
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:52,479
Scott: Oh, yeah That was a good one.

338
00:20:53,721 --> 00:20:55,768
Scott: This is a lot like that one, but it's not the round ones.

339
00:20:55,808 --> 00:21:02,861
Scott: I don't like and the round ones are - Anyway, yep Do you know?

340
00:21:02,881 --> 00:21:06,172
Scott: it's anime day anime manga and comics?

341
00:21:06,372 --> 00:21:07,857
Rym: Yeah are all that stuff?

342
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:10,926
Scott: web comics All those sorts of things.

343
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,130
Rym: Yep, though.

344
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,740
Rym: We did watch a episode one and two of a newish anime.

345
00:21:16,363 --> 00:21:16,946
Scott: It's very new.

346
00:21:17,247 --> 00:21:19,660
Rym: Yeah, it's very good to mushishi mushishi.

347
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:23,992
Rym: It's about these little things called mushi.

348
00:21:24,112 --> 00:21:25,016
Scott: Well, they're not all little.

349
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:25,959
Scott: they're all summer big.

350
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:27,165
Rym: at first I thought they were all little.

351
00:21:27,205 --> 00:21:33,260
Scott: they look like little like protists or little bacteria But you know the big ones were seem to be a bunch of little ones combined.

352
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:34,849
Scott: Yeah other times not.

353
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,460
Scott: it's sort of an ambiguous spiritual thing.

354
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:51,392
Rym: It's neat because the show starts and there's what looks like a main character and this like peripheral character character who comes in and Then through the episode You realize at the end that the peripheral guy who came in is the main character and the guy who thought was the main character Is just this one episode.

355
00:21:51,533 --> 00:21:53,707
Rym: throwaway side plot Yep, but I like.

356
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:58,899
Scott: it seems like every episode is it is a one episode plot Which is good because the order doesn't matter so much.

357
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:08,854
Scott: But I'm sure that over time that more about the mushishi guy with one eye is revealed Was an episode two and his mushishi pin and his mushi pin.

358
00:22:08,934 --> 00:22:10,900
Scott: mushi pin because the creatures are mushi.

359
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,460
Scott: Yes, he is a mushishi because he chases mushi, but it's not like Pokemon which is you know It's.

360
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,990
Scott: it's cool because it's like creatures but not Pokemon though.

361
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,336
Rym: He has at least one of these mushi.

362
00:22:19,376 --> 00:22:22,828
Scott: That is his own personal I'm sure he has more and he uses their powers.

363
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:26,520
Rym: But whatever it's a good show and it's worth watching.

364
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:27,443
Scott: Yeah, it's not.

365
00:22:27,524 --> 00:22:31,840
Scott: it's not an a a plus plus plus show, but it's the best show this season so far.

366
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:43,558
Scott: Yeah, if you like like shadow star Naruto, it's similar to that but that had a little more fighting Pokemon leanings Yeah, but it's like it's like Pokemon plus mushishi equals.

367
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:49,115
Rym: it is Strange and cool unexplained creatures in an episodic kind of deal.

368
00:22:49,395 --> 00:22:56,107
Scott: It's more in the genre of You know nice happy little Spiritual story kind of thing.

369
00:22:56,127 --> 00:22:57,371
Rym: It wasn't all happy though.

370
00:22:57,472 --> 00:22:57,994
Rym: Luckily.

371
00:22:58,134 --> 00:22:59,780
Rym: There were some happy endings in the early parts.

372
00:23:00,162 --> 00:23:06,457
Scott: Well, okay, they're not perfectly happy endings Which is good though because perfectly happy endings make for bad drag in the first episode.

373
00:23:06,497 --> 00:23:09,889
Rym: You see all these mushi You're like, oh the mushi are cool and cute and whatever.

374
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:10,552
Rym: They're happy.

375
00:23:10,572 --> 00:23:11,696
Rym: Then the second one.

376
00:23:11,716 --> 00:23:12,699
Rym: There's the bad mushi.

377
00:23:13,081 --> 00:23:13,563
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

378
00:23:13,623 --> 00:23:14,990
Scott: not all mushis are good or bad.

379
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:15,693
Scott: They're just mushi.

380
00:23:15,734 --> 00:23:18,167
Rym: They're just these creature things I like the way they look.

381
00:23:18,187 --> 00:23:19,193
Rym: they're really funny looking.

382
00:23:19,334 --> 00:23:20,360
Scott: some of them are cute and happy.

383
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:28,631
Scott: I like the ones that are all like translucent protozoa thingies and they fly around and I'm very glad that unlike cluster edge Nobody got the gay on them.

384
00:23:29,115 --> 00:23:33,808
Rym: There was no No, no Unexpected random gay god.

385
00:23:33,828 --> 00:23:36,760
Rym: I still can't get over that scene and freakin cluster edge.

386
00:23:37,262 --> 00:23:40,559
Scott: Yeah, we just we don't want anyone listening to this to think that we're homophobes or no.

387
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,860
Rym: We're not in fact considering that we have a tradition in our group known as the yaoi couch.

388
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:50,477
Scott: Yeah, but we can't take it when there's even an allusion to a yaoi in something.

389
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:58,760
Rym: We're actually watching Mainly because we have a friend who we were over hanging out at her house one day and we discovered her yaoi dungeon.

390
00:23:59,944 --> 00:24:00,627
Scott: Oh, yeah, she ate.

391
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:04,665
Scott: In fact, we were talking about making molds of penises Randomly.

392
00:24:04,705 --> 00:24:06,917
Rym: don't ask why we were talking about that.

393
00:24:07,158 --> 00:24:09,144
Rym: Yeah You don't want to know.

394
00:24:09,486 --> 00:24:17,995
Scott: but all of a sudden she had a relevant yaoi manga Sephiroth yeah making a mold of his penis and then impregnating himself with it.

395
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:25,678
Rym: and This one manga came out of a sea of manga under her bed and it was cool and creepy at the same time.

396
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:31,296
Scott: all of which Yeah, yeah, yep All right, mushishi to yaoi.

397
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:34,378
Rym: So, how do we get from yaoi to something else?

398
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,294
Scott: Well, let's talk about something that we really don't mind yaoi mixing with.

399
00:24:38,556 --> 00:24:39,279
Scott: didn't you watch?

400
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,040
Rym: gone kotsuo.

401
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:42,724
Scott: It's not so yaoi.

402
00:24:42,824 --> 00:24:44,811
Rym: No, it's not shamanic princess.

403
00:24:44,871 --> 00:24:46,135
Scott: You can talk about shamanic princess.

404
00:24:46,175 --> 00:24:47,620
Scott: We can get yaoi on that all we want.

405
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,064
Rym: Yeah, there's no yaoi in it though.

406
00:24:49,626 --> 00:24:50,749
Rym: No, it's old.

407
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:58,168
Rym: It's real, but it still looks kind of like it was animated Really well for when it was made and it's really wasn't made in the 90s.

408
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:00,354
Rym: Yeah early 90s early 90s early mid 90s.

409
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:03,986
Scott: Are you sure to take the year on it?

410
00:25:04,026 --> 00:25:04,970
Scott: Looks like a 96 or 97 to me early mid 90s.

411
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:07,642
Scott: It's pretty.

412
00:25:07,662 --> 00:25:08,507
Scott: let's go check the year.

413
00:25:08,588 --> 00:25:15,335
Rym: I saw it a long long time ago All right and I watched it again because I hadn't seen it in a while when I first seen it.

414
00:25:15,837 --> 00:25:18,808
Rym: it was a show that I had Seen one of my early my anime that I'd seen.

415
00:25:18,868 --> 00:25:26,760
Rym: so it was kind of uh, I saw it through the eyes of someone Thinks all anime is perfect and awesome and I loved it all and I watched it again.

416
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:30,020
Rym: I still really like the show but it's definitely not a anime.

417
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:34,715
Scott: Yeah, I remember when I was getting into anime and like anything was great.

418
00:25:34,835 --> 00:25:35,839
Scott: now not so much.

419
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:40,815
Rym: So I gotta say if you like pretty shows shamanic princess is definitely worth watching.

420
00:25:40,835 --> 00:25:49,500
Rym: It is definitely a Pretty people standing on top of tall spirey buildings saying poetic things than fighting with each other with magical things.

421
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:50,723
Scott: So it's so it's X.

422
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:53,511
Rym: yeah, it's a lot like X. it's that stylish 1996.

423
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:53,792
Rym: I'm the win.

424
00:25:53,812 --> 00:25:57,979
Scott: Yeah mid 90s whatever.

425
00:25:59,201 --> 00:26:00,325
Scott: What is it?

426
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:00,365
Scott: 99?

427
00:26:00,365 --> 00:26:01,709
Scott: You've been like mid 90s.

428
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:02,753
Scott: It's between 90 and 2000.

429
00:26:02,753 --> 00:26:03,496
Scott: It's in the mid.

430
00:26:06,401 --> 00:26:06,944
Rym: Yeah, 96.

431
00:26:06,944 --> 00:26:08,109
Rym: I was a freshman in high school.

432
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:12,211
Scott: that links up actually from when I saw it, all right Well, I guess that's good that you saw one is brand new.

433
00:26:12,251 --> 00:26:13,660
Rym: then I saw it was fairly new.

434
00:26:13,881 --> 00:26:16,756
Rym: Hey, I saw a crappy fan sub of it.

435
00:26:16,796 --> 00:26:24,742
Rym: In fact And I got to say the dub is The worst dub ever worse than you ten of them worse than the you ten of them I can't be.

436
00:26:25,303 --> 00:26:26,527
Rym: I should play some clips from.

437
00:26:26,547 --> 00:26:29,616
Scott: I think is if you haven't seen terrible dubs in a while.

438
00:26:29,636 --> 00:26:31,918
Rym: Oh my god.

439
00:26:32,901 --> 00:26:34,265
Rym: Just just for one example.

440
00:26:34,466 --> 00:26:53,187
Rym: There's this cute little fairy thing named Japolo and he has a funny like normal voice and in the American dub instead of having like a funny little guy kind of voice it has like the voice of an old carny and Everyone speaks in such a stilted way.

441
00:26:53,207 --> 00:26:56,356
Rym: an old carny like it like a carny from a carnival.

442
00:26:56,417 --> 00:27:00,899
Rym: only who she was old and She was a gypsy she or he I couldn't tell.

443
00:27:02,483 --> 00:27:03,994
Scott: So we did get the alley all over this.

444
00:27:04,578 --> 00:27:07,755
Rym: Ah Yeah, because the ferret was getting it on with yeah.

445
00:27:08,117 --> 00:27:16,778
Rym: Oh my god It was prime over Yuri show because it's all the main characters are girls and they all seem to like each other a lot in a very non yuri way.

446
00:27:18,801 --> 00:27:22,234
Rym: This was before yaoi and yuri became mainstream like they are now.

447
00:27:22,575 --> 00:27:23,960
Scott: Yeah, I don't think I'll be watching this show.

448
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:25,272
Scott: Let's send it back to Netflix.

449
00:27:25,575 --> 00:27:32,176
Scott: Yeah So, uh, I went to the comic-book store today and I see you picked up a rocket.

450
00:27:32,216 --> 00:27:33,120
Scott: Oh, I got a rocket.

451
00:27:33,282 --> 00:27:35,000
Rym: Oh, I see you picked up a death note.

452
00:27:35,422 --> 00:27:36,508
Scott: You know this death note the phone.

453
00:27:36,528 --> 00:27:37,413

00:27:37,453 --> 00:27:38,640
Scott: volume one day came out.

455
00:27:38,785 --> 00:27:39,682
Scott: Yeah There wasn't any.

456
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:44,500
Scott: let there's a little manga rack cuz they're the big wall full of comic books in a little rack of new manga.

457
00:27:45,043 --> 00:27:52,899
Scott: Then they have a wall of the old manga, but they have a rack of new manga, uh-huh There were no death notes on the rack of new manga when I went to get volume one when it came out.

458
00:27:53,764 --> 00:27:57,725
Scott: And I asked and they said oh, I guess we're sold out Today.

459
00:27:57,785 --> 00:28:05,180
Scott: I went and I go to the rack death note volume two not on the rack And I'm like damn it.

460
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,480
Scott: I don't want to come here like next week again because they to go the next week to get volume one.

461
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:16,415
Scott: It was so ah, oh, no, I went to the other Branch of the story by every death note a week off from when it comes out.

462
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,040
Scott: Yeah, but it's still a pain.

463
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,464
Rym: It's not like.

464
00:28:18,484 --> 00:28:21,505
Rym: you haven't already read it all Haven't read it all.

465
00:28:21,545 --> 00:28:22,893
Scott: the plane took off and I don't have this.

466
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:24,642
Rym: next, you know Who?

467
00:28:25,344 --> 00:28:28,715
Rym: you know what happens in the only part of the plot that I really care about.

468
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:29,819
Scott: it doesn't matter.

469
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:30,180
Scott: But anyway.

470
00:28:32,341 --> 00:28:35,560
Scott: So I asked the guy I was like, alright this guy was running around the store like a nut.

471
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,967
Scott: I think they were short on employees.

472
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:39,660
Scott: cuz one guy I always see there wasn't there, you know and stuff.

473
00:28:40,403 --> 00:28:42,651
Scott: And I'm like got death note, so he looks on the rack.

474
00:28:42,711 --> 00:28:43,474
Scott: it's not on the rack.

475
00:28:43,635 --> 00:28:44,960
Scott: the rack actually was really empty.

476
00:28:45,842 --> 00:28:47,840
Scott: So he goes and he's like, where's the overstock?

477
00:28:48,262 --> 00:28:50,800
Scott: I got the last one in the overstock awesome.

478
00:28:50,961 --> 00:28:53,735
Scott: Then he took the overstock and he started filling up the manga shelf again.

479
00:28:54,297 --> 00:28:57,643
Scott: I was like, yes Death note is awesome.

480
00:28:58,065 --> 00:28:59,148
Scott: Yeah, and I read it again.

481
00:28:59,168 --> 00:29:00,111
Scott: It's still awesome.

482
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,936
Rym: If you haven't read death note read it.

483
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:05,806
Scott: Oh my god They're two volumes out now by them all.

484
00:29:06,146 --> 00:29:14,239
Rym: Oh my god, cuz I must say Ryuku is probably the best character in any manga ever with the possible exception of major kusanagi yourself.

485
00:29:15,924 --> 00:29:18,180
Scott: He's cool Thing is the coolest.

486
00:29:18,722 --> 00:29:25,123
Rym: He's the only person I've ever seen in any manga who got both upside downy and inside outy at the same time for not eating Apples.

487
00:29:25,485 --> 00:29:28,060
Scott: Oh, oh, oh my god when you read it again.

488
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:33,240
Scott: There's great stuff in here like when he makes the prisoners who commit suicide write notes before they die.

489
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,820
Scott: Yeah, and he reads down the left-hand columns.

490
00:29:36,522 --> 00:29:41,360
Scott: L looks at the notes and he reads down the left-hand columns like the first letters and the first words of each sentence.

491
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,529
Scott: Yeah, and it says like L. Do you know?

492
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:48,342
Scott: it said that in Japanese - yeah, and the next one says gods of death.

493
00:29:49,223 --> 00:29:52,570
Scott: and the last one says eat apples or like apples.

494
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,592
Rym: I Don't remember that.

495
00:29:54,815 --> 00:29:56,708
Scott: Yeah I don't remember that kind of stuff either.

496
00:29:56,768 --> 00:29:58,757
Scott: cuz I reminded me of when you were talking.

497
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:01,980
Scott: you were like Remember when L was all freaking about about the gods of death.

498
00:30:02,321 --> 00:30:06,400
Scott: That's why he was freaking out about the gods of death because he talked about it in the stupid notes.

499
00:30:06,902 --> 00:30:08,227
Scott: Maybe that was it.

500
00:30:08,608 --> 00:30:10,697
Scott: No before then L didn't even know about guys.

501
00:30:10,717 --> 00:30:11,560
Rym: Look at L's eyes.

502
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,612
Rym: There's no way that there's not some connection between Ellen, but look he's like.

503
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:16,936
Scott: are you saying that?

504
00:30:17,298 --> 00:30:17,940
Scott: what do they call him?

505
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:18,761
Rym: Shinigami?

506
00:30:18,781 --> 00:30:23,155
Scott: Shinigami exists question mark, that's when he started getting on it and then after it.

507
00:30:23,175 --> 00:30:31,008
Scott: whenever he hears gods of death again He's like, uh-huh Because it was written in those notes that Kira made him write down.

508
00:30:31,048 --> 00:30:31,750
Rym: See we'll see.

509
00:30:31,971 --> 00:30:32,914
Rym: cuz look at his eyes.

510
00:30:33,235 --> 00:30:34,097
Rym: There's something there.

511
00:30:34,238 --> 00:30:35,262
Rym: I'll bet money now.

512
00:30:35,302 --> 00:30:45,192
Scott: look before he was talking about gods of death and he was all freaking out about it and Just disagree you didn't have the manga.

513
00:30:45,433 --> 00:30:47,239
Scott: I read it more recent, you know what you know what?

514
00:30:48,502 --> 00:30:49,324
Rym: Look at his eyes.

515
00:30:49,364 --> 00:30:53,498
Scott: His eyes aren't like that until after he's read those notes from Kira.

516
00:30:54,522 --> 00:30:55,787
Rym: No, his eyes are always that way.

517
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:57,634
Scott: his eyes aren't like that.

518
00:30:58,095 --> 00:30:59,200
Scott: Oh god, you're such a nut.

519
00:31:00,783 --> 00:31:02,033
Scott: You always try to look into it.

520
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:02,880
Scott: so much to the point.

521
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,220
Scott: You know what assume we're looking in is right and it's never right because it worked with Gundam seed.

522
00:31:07,381 --> 00:31:10,572
Rym: I was right about almost everything except the one unpredictable.

523
00:31:10,612 --> 00:31:12,780
Scott: He doesn't like this completely different.

524
00:31:15,102 --> 00:31:19,900
Scott: It does not logically follow that because you can predict one anime you can predict every anime and manga there is.

525
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,359
Rym: Well, I'm still waiting for one character in Death Note who left And I figured they would come back and they didn't and I'm curious about that.

526
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:37,099
Rym: Yeah, we can't really talk anymore because I'd a lot of people haven't read this and I don't want to spoil it because it's one Of the best manga I've read in a long time.

527
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:40,800
Scott: It's you know, I'm sure there's tons and tons of manga that are really awesome.

528
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,633
Scott: We haven't read but I've read lots and lots of awesome.

529
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:45,120
Scott: Manga is at least all the English ones.

530
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,465
Scott: Yeah, it was really awesome.

531
00:31:46,986 --> 00:31:49,154
Scott: Very good, and it sells out.

532
00:31:49,255 --> 00:31:50,579
Scott: So it's not just me.

533
00:31:51,404 --> 00:31:56,325
Rym: They have raws of it at Walden books, so Yeah, and they sell.

534
00:31:56,345 --> 00:32:01,400
Scott: I guess kind of yeah, they sell well enough to keep having them, but something no one knows about.

535
00:32:01,721 --> 00:32:02,506
Scott: Yeah, rocket.

536
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:03,794
Scott: Oh rocket.

537
00:32:03,814 --> 00:32:04,257
Scott: Oh rocket.

538
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:08,266
Scott: Oh is so And no one knows about.

539
00:32:08,446 --> 00:32:09,550
Scott: a few people know about it.

540
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:12,400
Scott: it might be the most popular indie comic right now.

541
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,370
Rym: Yeah, read rocket.

542
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:20,800
Scott: Oh, it's pretty Sideways, so you'll see it and you'll know it looks like a comic book But it opens at the bottom instead of the side.

543
00:32:21,503 --> 00:32:22,687
Scott: Well, I guess stapled at the top.

544
00:32:22,727 --> 00:32:25,820
Scott: so you flip it up, but you rotate the whole thing 90 degrees to read it.

545
00:32:26,061 --> 00:32:27,345
Rym: So it's why it's like a land.

546
00:32:27,426 --> 00:32:28,208
Scott: It's a landscape.

547
00:32:28,349 --> 00:32:30,978
Scott: Yeah landscape comic book and it's awesome.

548
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,931
Rym: It's got this cool style of drawing.

549
00:32:34,951 --> 00:32:39,504
Scott: Well, it's like painting kind of and the characters are very Awesome.

550
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:40,813
Rym: There's not much I can say.

551
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:41,558
Rym: you just got to read it.

552
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:53,099
Scott: It's about this guy and like this other universe or world or ever and he's a navigator or mapper Yeah, and he has like a compass in his hand and the mapper is the only people who can know where they're going.

553
00:32:53,119 --> 00:33:01,353
Scott: and there's only different races like cat people and dog people and Lizard, but I still like that tiger guy from the first.

554
00:33:01,534 --> 00:33:06,720
Scott: tiger guy was definitely awesome But in this one, there's a new kind of guy in issue three is very awesome.

555
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,243
Scott: Is that the guy?

556
00:33:07,263 --> 00:33:10,400
Rym: you showed me a glimpse of the guy I showed you glimpse of guy I think is a bad guy.

557
00:33:10,962 --> 00:33:11,726
Scott: He's not a bad guy.

558
00:33:11,746 --> 00:33:12,731
Rym: He's got to be a bad guy.

559
00:33:12,751 --> 00:33:14,440
Rym: No, no one good looks that evil.

560
00:33:15,185 --> 00:33:16,192
Scott: Yeah, oh he's kind of good.

561
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:17,099
Scott: he's pretty good.

562
00:33:18,085 --> 00:33:19,000
Scott: He's definitely not a villain.

563
00:33:19,221 --> 00:33:22,592
Scott: Anyway, the whole thing is is made by Frank Espinosa.

564
00:33:22,612 --> 00:33:24,740
Scott: at least he does all the art and I think he writes it.

565
00:33:25,021 --> 00:33:33,707
Scott: but there's a co-writer Mary Taylor and as a logo designer And let's see this presented whatever.

566
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:35,452
Scott: president you didn't do anything.

567
00:33:35,632 --> 00:33:37,999
Scott: creative director Chris stone, I guess he did something.

568
00:33:39,082 --> 00:33:45,490
Scott: But those it's really weird for an American comic to have so few people working on it Usually a manga like even Death Note, which is crazy.

569
00:33:46,012 --> 00:33:48,199
Scott: It's made by two people the story and the art guy.

570
00:33:48,761 --> 00:33:50,205
Scott: That's that's and that's unusual.

571
00:33:50,225 --> 00:33:54,297
Scott: A lot of times is one guy story and art, you know, like Akira.

572
00:33:54,337 --> 00:33:55,299
Scott: It's so huge one guy.

573
00:33:55,762 --> 00:33:57,234
Scott: Yeah, American comics.

574
00:33:57,274 --> 00:34:04,332
Scott: It's usually like writer penciler inker Tracer trace it.

575
00:34:04,372 --> 00:34:11,679
Scott: Yeah Actually, they're not really traces but it's like they separate all these things out because they have to produce it so fast.

576
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,931
Scott: Yeah, and it's so with the crazy colors and the high productions.

577
00:34:14,972 --> 00:34:16,980
Scott: They need a lot of people to do it the American way.

578
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,737
Scott: But you know to do them black and white, I guess you don't need so many people.

579
00:34:20,797 --> 00:34:25,540
Rym: but yeah Well, I know a lot of mangaka just kind of work at their own pace and they come out whenever they finish them.

580
00:34:25,821 --> 00:34:36,400
Scott: Yeah, well they come up with very few pages like weekly when in America They need to come out with like like 20 high quality pages monthly, you know.

581
00:34:37,601 --> 00:34:40,179
Scott: And it's not easy because they have editors like telling them what to do.

582
00:34:40,465 --> 00:34:46,580
Rym: Yeah The manga guys just do whatever they want really plus that comics used to have the things like the comics code kind of crippling them.

583
00:34:46,821 --> 00:34:47,904
Scott: Well, but that's gone now.

584
00:34:47,944 --> 00:34:52,679
Scott: Yeah, except for Archie comics and uh-huh DC Comics still do the comics code.

585
00:34:52,821 --> 00:34:54,239
Scott: No one else there don't cares anymore.

586
00:34:55,882 --> 00:34:56,605
Scott: Yeah, but Rockit.

587
00:34:56,626 --> 00:34:56,967
Scott: Oh, it's.

588
00:34:57,108 --> 00:34:59,219
Scott: it's like kind of a watercolor type of thing.

589
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:11,873
Rym: It reminds me a lot of like 50s type sci-fi Only kind of like only samurai jack with less colors and less hard edges Kinda, it's very soft and there aren't many hard edges at all.

590
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:13,923
Scott: Yeah, but it's very awesome It is.

591
00:35:13,943 --> 00:35:17,060
Rym: it is if you're not gonna read Death Note at least read Rockit.

592
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:25,578
Scott: Oh, if you just go to the comic book store near you or an online comic book store or something I mean even if you don't want to buy how many comic books is it gonna be?

593
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,162
Scott: Doesn't know.

594
00:35:27,182 --> 00:35:31,776
Rym: I don't know how many it's gonna be by the first one and read it You'll get enough out of that to make it worth it.

595
00:35:32,118 --> 00:35:38,276
Scott: Yeah Actually like the first volume the best Right, you know, even though volume three is real good and two is real good.

596
00:35:38,296 --> 00:35:39,180
Scott: It's it's all real good.

597
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:40,324
Scott: They'll be.

598
00:35:40,344 --> 00:35:41,970
Scott: I'm sure there'll be a trade paperback one day.

599
00:35:42,011 --> 00:35:44,179
Scott: I'll buy and then give that to people.

600
00:35:46,281 --> 00:35:51,600
Scott: Yeah, Rockit Oh rules, yep, no one knows about it except for really awesome people.

601
00:35:52,163 --> 00:35:54,273
Scott: but now everyone should know about it and read it.

602
00:35:55,499 --> 00:36:02,314
Rym: and Tomorrow in our Netflix comes the final DVD of ghost in the shell standalone complex Which we had yet to see the end of.

603
00:36:02,334 --> 00:36:08,980
Scott: yeah I think the episodes that I hadn't seen yet were the ones that we just watched and I love that show.

604
00:36:09,261 --> 00:36:09,803
Scott: It's a great show.

605
00:36:10,205 --> 00:36:11,028
Rym: It's a real good show.

606
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:17,760
Scott: compared to you and when you've been in such a drought of anime It's good to have shows that were great that you didn't watch that you can fall back on.

607
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:24,076
Rym: Yep, if nothing good comes out in the next few months We're gonna have to watch like Nadesha Co which neither one of us have seen strangely.

608
00:36:24,297 --> 00:36:25,040
Rym: Yeah, it's really weird.

609
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,405
Rym: You've seen like every anime.

610
00:36:26,626 --> 00:36:27,871
Rym: so I ran a freaking anime Club.

611
00:36:27,891 --> 00:36:33,974
Rym: You remember like the biggest anime Club we hung out We spent whole weekends marathoning shows never saw Nadesha Co.

612
00:36:34,335 --> 00:36:34,456
Scott: Nope.

613
00:36:34,857 --> 00:36:35,620
Scott: We saw everything else.

614
00:36:35,841 --> 00:36:47,338
Scott: Yeah, but there's a lot of old shows that are great that we didn't see what else you have in our queue at the Zee Gundam Zee Gundam, yep Last exile isn't that old but I was wanted lost exile.

615
00:36:47,399 --> 00:36:49,003
Scott: last Knows, I don't remember.

616
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:50,047
Scott: but yeah, we should see that.

617
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:51,973
Rym: Yeah, Akino's journey looks cool.

618
00:36:52,073 --> 00:36:54,100
Scott: Yeah, it looks like a little girly show.

619
00:36:54,763 --> 00:36:56,510
Rym: Yeah, of course gone could suppose coming out.

620
00:36:56,551 --> 00:36:58,479
Rym: I'm gonna buy all the DVDs because I love that show.

621
00:36:58,903 --> 00:37:00,580
Scott: Good you only watch like a few episodes.

622
00:37:00,781 --> 00:37:02,749
Rym: I watched the first seven and I loved.

623
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:07,065
Scott: I think I watch like a little over half of the show and then Stopped cuz I don't know what happened.

624
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:14,539
Rym: if you've read the book the unabridged penguin classics count of Monte Cristo Gone could suppose a thousand times better to watch.

625
00:37:15,661 --> 00:37:17,709
Scott: Yeah, yeah things like that.

626
00:37:17,809 --> 00:37:18,632
Scott: But whatever.

627
00:37:19,134 --> 00:37:20,098
Scott: It's still a fun show.

628
00:37:20,299 --> 00:37:24,900
Scott: it is It's not the greatest greatest show but it was the part that I got to is really cool.

629
00:37:25,282 --> 00:37:26,447
Scott: And then I stopped watching.

630
00:37:26,527 --> 00:37:28,978
Scott: I think cuz they stopped being available or it left r.i.t.

631
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:29,340
Scott: I don't know.

632
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,380
Rym: Yeah, most of what makes the show great is that it's very pretty and it's very stylized.

633
00:37:33,842 --> 00:37:37,177
Scott: Well, all the people that are important have those like magic clothes that they put on.

634
00:37:37,197 --> 00:37:38,524
Scott: Yeah It's what doesn't have.

635
00:37:38,544 --> 00:37:41,920
Scott: the gonzo spends a lot of money on a show plus shows like that are right up my alley.

636
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:47,655
Rym: I mean my favorite friggin show is still utenna which is the same kind of deal of stylized pretty people.

637
00:37:48,582 --> 00:37:51,592
Scott: But it was so cheap to make and gotten good.

638
00:37:51,613 --> 00:37:52,877
Scott: So it was so expensive.

639
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:53,700
Scott: It's completely different.

640
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,353
Rym: Yeah, imagine if you tenor were made as high production value as Gonkatsu.

641
00:37:57,373 --> 00:37:59,400
Scott: Oh was he would be the same thing.

642
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:06,090
Scott: It would just be better color in terms of like Looking like 2000 and not like 91 when it was.

643
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:16,749
Rym: maybe the fights wouldn't just be like utenna and toga standing there with like a silhouette of their swords going All right, all right, maybe that would change.

644
00:38:16,969 --> 00:38:20,533
Rym: yeah, they're probably more - - That would be good.

645
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:25,571
Scott: Who could potentially be the only one Akio did not have sex with?

646
00:38:26,032 --> 00:38:26,794
Rym: yeah, yeah.

647
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:30,171
Scott: Yeah, but we don't know that for sure But that's the only one.

648
00:38:30,191 --> 00:38:30,838
Scott: there's a chance.

649
00:38:32,284 --> 00:38:36,014
Scott: He's the only chance All right.

650
00:38:36,436 --> 00:38:36,879
Scott: Are we done?

651
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:37,985
Rym: I got nothing.

652
00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:40,997
Scott: Oh We're gonna keep our bit of telling a story.

653
00:38:41,178 --> 00:38:41,961
Rym: Oh, we should tell the story.

00:38:42,001 --> 00:38:43,145

Scott: Uh-huh but anyway, it was him and Outstanding.

710
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:32,845
Scott: the funny part was that my mom told me the story and then I told everyone.

711
00:41:32,885 --> 00:41:36,876
Scott: I knew I got a story And I didn't tell what the story was.

712
00:41:37,137 --> 00:41:47,966
Scott: and then I came and they were all in the same place at the same time And I told the story to everyone at once And it created a lot of suspense.

713
00:41:48,388 --> 00:41:48,670
Rym: you did.

714
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:53,148
Rym: I remember that I remember being pissed because you kept saying I got a story but it's gotta wait.

715
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:55,244
Rym: It's gotta wait It's gotta wait and it worked.

716
00:41:55,728 --> 00:41:55,990
Rym: it did.

717
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:58,415
Rym: I'm you're lucky.

718
00:41:58,435 --> 00:42:01,550
Rym: You're damn lucky that that story lived up to the expectation.

719
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:03,280
Scott: What kind of story you think I was gonna tell?

720
00:42:03,581 --> 00:42:04,949
Rym: we expected you to be like nothing.

721
00:42:06,511 --> 00:42:07,073
Rym: Nothing happened.

722
00:42:07,716 --> 00:42:18,440
Scott: I'm just screwing with you guys or you would have told one of your stories like so Now sitting around there waiting for me to show up thinking of what the story could be and not even coming close Not even close.

723
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:22,241
Rym: I Mean never would have suspected Ron Jeremy.

724
00:42:22,642 --> 00:42:24,430
Scott: No, that's why it was great.

725
00:42:24,994 --> 00:42:30,007
Scott: Yeah, if I would have thought you would have figured it out I wouldn't given you any time to figure it out because that would have ruined it.

726
00:42:30,811 --> 00:42:35,026
Scott: Imagine if I came and I told it right and whether it was a good story or not.

727
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:36,050
Scott: It was something you would thought of.

728
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,400
Scott: You would have been like oh we thought of that.

729
00:42:39,461 --> 00:42:41,230
Scott: you suck I feel like but it was still good.

730
00:42:41,371 --> 00:42:42,321
Scott: Just cuz you thought of that.

731
00:42:42,362 --> 00:42:43,049
Scott: now, I'm the suck.

732
00:42:44,052 --> 00:42:46,949
Scott: It could only be something you couldn't have thought of and also not the suck.

733
00:42:48,512 --> 00:42:51,650
Rym: So I will wait for the results of that DNA test, right?

734
00:42:52,150 --> 00:43:01,086
Rym: Yeah, and that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

735
00:43:01,106 --> 00:43:05,449
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the music and promotional consideration was provided by no one.
