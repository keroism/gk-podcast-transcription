00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,630
Rym: It's Tuesday, October 24th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,290
Rym: Tonight, we bring you our coverage of UberCon, though we are still compressor-less.

3
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:19,588
Scott: Let's do this!

4
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:27,770
Rym: Man, I don't know what was in the air today, but on my way to work, I passed four independent, serious, life-threatening accidents.

5
00:00:28,492 --> 00:00:30,048
Scott: Whoa, that's kinda screwy.

6
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,690
Rym: Like, literally, on my way to work, four separate, unrelated accidents that involved completely destroyed, mangled cars.

7
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:40,210
Rym: And the thing is, they were all individual accidents that only involved a single car.

8
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:47,489
Scott: Nah, I didn't see any accidents, but I was driving, and this guy in front of me was making a left turn, and he made it.

9
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,324
Scott: He was just turning off a road onto another road, but his car totally went like,

10
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:52,188
Scott: "Errrrr!".

11
00:00:53,157 --> 00:00:54,090
Scott: I don't know what he was doing.

12
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,270
Rym: Not knowing how to drive, apparently.

13
00:00:56,631 --> 00:00:57,938
Scott: Some piece of shit car, too.

14
00:00:58,078 --> 00:01:00,370
Scott: I don't know, maybe he had bad tires or something.

15
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:06,150
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, before we begin, I would like to apologize again, I'll be doing this all week, for the audio quality.

16
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:20,770
Rym: It seems we left the power cable to our compressor at UberCon, and as the company is not very forthcoming in sending us the replacement part in any reasonable span, we are stuck compressor-less until next week when the new compressor we just bought arrives.

17
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,430
Scott: It might show up before next week, if we're lucky.

18
00:01:24,194 --> 00:01:25,149
Rym: I guarantee it won't.

19
00:01:25,593 --> 00:01:26,609
Scott: It could, there's a chance.

20
00:01:27,356 --> 00:01:27,950
Rym: Nah, nah, not really.

21
00:01:28,352 --> 00:01:28,789
Scott: Small chance.

22
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:31,048
Rym: Not before next week on the show.

23
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:34,470
Scott: Uh, small, very small chance.

24
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:39,270
Rym: Uh, no, because tonight's over, and tomorrow's Wednesday already, and it's not gonna come Thursday.

25
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:41,989
Scott: It might, Travis.

26
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,650
Rym: Considering I didn't even order it yet.

27
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,310
Scott: Yeah, there's free shipping, though, it might be free overnight shipping, and then we're set.

28
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:49,269
Rym: Yeah, I highly doubt that.

29
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:54,550
Rym: So anyway, GeekNights sounds now like it did about a year ago, before we had professional equipment.

30
00:01:55,453 --> 00:01:57,230
Scott: And it'll sound better soon enough.

31
00:01:57,471 --> 00:02:04,830
Rym: Yeah, so to any of you who were complaining about, you know, how we spend money on all of our fancy equipment, this is what you get without that fancy equipment.

32
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:10,130
Scott: Yeah, a lot of people, I don't know how many podcasters use compressors, not many.

33
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:22,590
Scott: And I know a lot of them that do have compressors, you know, aren't audio engineers, and they don't know how to set them up properly, and they might have them set up okay, or they might have them set up in a useless fashion, but it makes a big difference.

34
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:29,607
Rym: Yeah, I mean, most of the people who don't have compressors seem to say that, "Oh, we don't need one," or, "Eh, you guys just wasted money on that, but here's

35
00:02:29,647 --> 00:02:29,909
Rym: proof.".

36
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,610
Scott: Yeah, listen to the episode last week, and then listen to this one, and tell me there's a difference, or not.

37
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,889
Rym: But anyway, like we said today, we'll have our coverage of UberCon, but first, the news.

38
00:02:41,992 --> 00:02:42,274
Scott: Alright.

39
00:02:42,294 --> 00:02:43,158
Scott: So, Lixang.

40
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:45,550
Scott: You know Lixang, that company in Hong Kong?

41
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:48,630
Rym: The company that makes all the awesome mod chip import stuff?

42
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:50,015
Scott: Well, they don't make them.

43
00:02:50,055 --> 00:02:59,210
Scott: They sell imported video game consoles, video games, video game modifications and chips and things, you know, and they'll ship almost anywhere in the world.

44
00:02:59,611 --> 00:03:01,966
Scott: Mostly to the US, Europe, et cetera, et cetera.

45
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,035
Scott: And they're pretty reliable.

46
00:03:04,095 --> 00:03:07,730
Scott: I mean, this is a place, you know, ordering that kind of stuff is often shady.

47
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,350
Scott: You buy a mod chip, you don't know if that guy's gonna send it to you, if he's gonna take your money and head for the hills.

48
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:13,929
Rym: Granted, I've never had a problem.

49
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,510
Scott: Yeah, true, but Lixang is a very trustworthy company.

50
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:18,269
Rym: Well, it was.

51
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,030
Scott: Was.

52
00:03:19,715 --> 00:03:21,710
Scott: Until now, they've decided to go under.

53
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,010
Rym: Now, not to Australia under, but gone under.

54
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,150
Scott: Yes, this could be the end of Lixang.

55
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:35,790
Scott: Now, they've agreed that anyone who already ordered something is gonna get a refund and, you know, all that good stuff.

56
00:03:36,111 --> 00:03:44,250
Scott: So, they're gonna take care of all their current business, but once they're done with their current business and they've got it all cleared out, there will be no more Lixang.

57
00:03:44,731 --> 00:03:54,590
Rym: See, this is really sad because they were not only such an upstanding company who provided a service that a lot of people wanted and needed, especially Europeans who don't have access to a lot of the games that they want to play.

58
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:57,770
Scott: Or they get the games way late.

59
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:05,110
Rym: Even when they've been completely dicked over by the whole industry and they're going under, they still stay around long enough to settle all their debts.

60
00:04:05,451 --> 00:04:05,631
Rym: Yep.

61
00:04:06,553 --> 00:04:13,390
Scott: So, anyway, Lixang is saying that the reason they have to go out of business is because Sony sued 'em to death.

62
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,130
Scott: And what, basically, the idea that I can get from reading a couple blogs...

63
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:20,450
Rym: Great.

64
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:20,911
Scott: Yeah.

65
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,229
Scott: Well, all the blogs seem to report the same thing.

66
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:24,052
Scott: Ha!

67
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,650
Rym: That means something.

68
00:04:26,113 --> 00:04:26,828
Scott: It sure does.

69
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:37,370
Scott: Um, is that Sony was mad about Lixang sending PSPs over to Europe before the PSP was released in Europe.

70
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:43,770
Scott: So, they sued Lixang in every European country one at a time.

71
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:50,030
Scott: Lixang couldn't afford to defend itself in any European country, so Sony went to court in London.

72
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,486
Scott: Lixang didn't show up.

73
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:55,090
Scott: Sony got a judgement against Lixang, of course.

74
00:04:56,071 --> 00:04:57,699
Scott: And Lixang is basically screwed.

75
00:04:57,739 --> 00:04:59,930
Scott: They can't do business, you know, in Europe anymore.

76
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:06,204
Scott: So, Lixang put out a press release saying, "Uh, well, we have to go out of business 'cause Sony sued us.

77
00:05:06,304 --> 00:05:07,387
Scott: We can't afford to fight it.

78
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:07,588
Scott: We're

79
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:07,808
Scott: done.".

80
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:11,190
Rym: See, Sony just is doing nothing but evil lately.

81
00:05:12,151 --> 00:05:12,374
Scott: Right.

82
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:13,529
Scott: Now, here's the other thing.

83
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:21,446
Scott: Is that just now, or not too long ago, Sony said, "Eh, you just got sour grapes.

84
00:05:21,527 --> 00:05:23,090
Scott: You shouldn't be having to go out of business.

85
00:05:23,753 --> 00:05:25,399
Scott: You're not paying any court fees.

86
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,202
Scott: You didn't show up.

87
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,227
Scott: You're not paying the fee to

88
00:05:27,488 --> 00:05:27,548
Scott: us.".

89
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:34,930
Scott: 'Cause, I don't know, you know, I guess the judge said they had to pay a fee to Sony, but Lixang isn't paying it.

90
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:39,810
Scott: They're just not doing business in Europe anymore, so they didn't really lose any current money.

91
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,070
Scott: They're just losing the possibility of European business.

92
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,910
Rym: Well, Europe's their primary market.

93
00:05:45,773 --> 00:05:46,567
Scott: I guess it is, yeah.

94
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:57,990
Scott: The other thing is, Lixang accused Sony of buying PSPs in Europe, you know, to, I guess, prove that they were selling PSPs to Europe.

95
00:05:58,631 --> 00:06:02,370
Scott: And Sony was pretty wise in their response.

96
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:07,963
Scott: Is they were like, "Yeah, we did that for, if we did it, it was for investigatory

97
00:06:07,983 --> 00:06:08,805
Scott: reasons.".

98
00:06:10,973 --> 00:06:11,878
Scott: I don't know how to say that.

99
00:06:12,421 --> 00:06:13,106
Scott: Is that a word?

100
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:13,790
Scott: Investigatory?

101
00:06:15,052 --> 00:06:19,270
Rym: See, now what really bothers me here is simply that this should be a free trade issue.

102
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:27,510
Rym: If a company wants to buy another company's product and sell it somewhere, and not, I mean, it's not like they're saying they're Sony or anything.

103
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,720
Rym: They're very clearly reselling something.

104
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:31,850
Rym: There's nothing false about what they're doing.

105
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:34,485
Rym: How could this possibly actually be illegal?

106
00:06:34,606 --> 00:06:35,089
Rym: It shouldn't be.

107
00:06:35,611 --> 00:06:42,890
Scott: Well, I think the reason it's illegal is because there's a difference between a retailer and a person.

108
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:52,909
Scott: You know, a retailer buys things wholesale from a distributor, and then sells them with an agreement with the producer of the product and all that jazz.

109
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:53,712
Rym: Yeah, and you know what?

110
00:06:53,732 --> 00:06:57,870
Rym: There's nothing illegal with me going to a toy store, buying a toy, and then selling it to someone else.

111
00:06:58,612 --> 00:07:04,346
Scott: I guess there isn't in one country, but I guess once you go over international borders, there's some sort of law.

112
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:05,930
Scott: It doesn't say what law.

113
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,770
Rym: I'm just saying that this sort of thing, I mean, I'm sure there are bullshit laws against it.

114
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,690
Rym: I mean, just like all the laws to enforce and maintain things like region locking on various bits.

115
00:07:15,952 --> 00:07:20,090
Rym: In general, I think that those sorts of things shouldn't be allowed and shouldn't be enforced by any government.

116
00:07:20,971 --> 00:07:26,328
Scott: I think, you know, that's my argument against free trade is, you know, people always argue, "Ah, free trade is

117
00:07:26,448 --> 00:07:26,709
Scott: evil.".

118
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:34,710
Scott: You know, people can, you know, send jobs overseas without having to pay to import goods and all this stuff, and it's terrible.

119
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:43,590
Scott: Well, it's only terrible because the only people who get to take advantage of the free trade are the people who are gonna do generally bad things with free trade.

120
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:51,430
Scott: If it was free trade for everyone, if I could trade freely with anyone else in the entire world, then it would be awesome.

121
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,293
Scott: We could do all sorts of stuff.

122
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:59,287
Scott: No one would be able to sell jeans in Europe for 60 bucks and in America for 40 bucks.

123
00:07:59,308 --> 00:08:00,170
Scott: You couldn't get away with it.

124
00:08:00,673 --> 00:08:01,481
Scott: It would be awesome.

125
00:08:01,743 --> 00:08:02,510
Scott: Totally awesome.

126
00:08:02,891 --> 00:08:04,744
Rym: You think someone's gonna sell jeans for a $20 profit?

127
00:08:06,931 --> 00:08:16,709
Scott: You know, actually, I remember when I went on vacation, people said, "Oh yeah, Europeans come to America to buy jeans, and we go over there to buy

128
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:17,070
Scott: gold.".

129
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,630
Scott: Because I think the gold over there is cheaper, and the clothing over here is cheaper.

130
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:27,450
Rym: So anyway, in actual news, apparently there are a large number of penises on the Xbox Live cameras.

131
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:33,130
Scott: Well, this is an old news, but I think there was a particularly hilarious recent incident.

132
00:08:33,371 --> 00:08:36,809
Rym: Well, I only went with this because Scott didn't seem to want me to talk about Jack Thompson.

133
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,210
Scott: Because it wasn't better than previous Jack Thompsons.

134
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:40,359
Rym: He might go to jail.

135
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,650
Rym: He's up for jail at least.

136
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,649
Scott: When he's in jail, then we'll talk about it.

137
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,142
Rym: Yeah, he's up for contempt.

138
00:08:46,162 --> 00:08:46,870
Rym: He might go to jail.

139
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:47,350
Rym: We'll see.

140
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:56,110
Rym: But there have been a bunch of news articles lately about the fact that because you can have a camera in Xbox Live, you can possibly see genitalia.

141
00:08:56,772 --> 00:09:03,150
Rym: And apparently, where all this is going down is in Uno, where people will play Uno, but they're not really playing Uno.

142
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,370
Rym: They're just using their video chat to do funny things.

143
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:12,870
Rym: People dressed up as Nazis or KKK guys or furries or naked guys, masturbating furiously.

144
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,770
Rym: That, by the way, is a quote from the article.

145
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:19,574
Scott: It makes it kind of worth it to get an Xbox 360.

146
00:09:19,574 --> 00:09:20,930
Rym: I don't think I need to say it, Scott.

147
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:30,800
Rym: Anyway, things of the day, which I can't say loudly because it'll clip.

148
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:39,080
Scott: Alright, so Donkey Konga is this game that came out for the GameCube where you bang on bongos and clap, and it's a pretty simple rhythm game.

149
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,840
Scott: You bang on the left bongo, the right bongo, the both bongos at the same time.

150
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:49,180
Rym: Yeah, the game's really fun, but it's totally not in any way difficult to play or be good at.

151
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,060
Rym: You can totally master the game in like 10 minutes at most.

152
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,560
Scott: Yeah, if you can do DDR, Donkey Konga is the easiest thing in the universe.

153
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,360
Scott: Freaking Samba de Amigo is harder than Donkey Konga.

154
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,960
Rym: Samba de Amigo is freaking hard.

155
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,721
Scott: Yeah, it is.

156
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:11,380
Scott: The point is, to make Donkey Kong more fun, you have to do the multiplayer mode where there's four people and each person has their own set of bongos.

157
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:21,300
Scott: And unlike DDR, where in two-player mode, both people dance the same arrows at the same time, in Donkey Konga, you sort of take turns bongoing.

158
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,279
Scott: You know, one person does one thing, another person does another thing.

159
00:10:24,621 --> 00:10:34,300
Scott: Occasionally, you know, maybe two of the people will hit the same bongo at the same time, everyone will clap together, you know, so it's a fun party kind of song.

160
00:10:34,961 --> 00:10:40,060
Rym: Yeah, it's not actually a game, it's more like Karaoke Revolution, where you're just having fun.

161
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,548
Scott: Yeah, you all work together to create the music.

162
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:45,720
Scott: Well, some guy decided Donkey Konga was too easy.

163
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:53,120
Scott: So he got four sets of bongos, he tied them together to make this big eight bongo set.

164
00:10:53,982 --> 00:11:01,900
Scott: He plugged it in and set it to four-player mode, and he played all four sets of bongos by himself.

165
00:11:02,741 --> 00:11:03,325
Scott: And he beat it.

166
00:11:03,506 --> 00:11:05,720
Scott: He played the Pokemon theme song.

167
00:11:06,147 --> 00:11:06,439
Rym: Great.

168
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:07,917
Scott: And he beat the whole thing.

169
00:11:09,161 --> 00:11:10,860
Rym: You know, gotta catch 'em, gotta catch 'em all?

170
00:11:11,082 --> 00:11:11,499
Scott: Exactly.

171
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,358
Rym: That's in Donkey Konga?

172
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,273
Scott: Apparently it is.

173
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,819
Rym: That's not much of a song.

174
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:22,140
Scott: It doesn't look like much of a song to me, but I don't think I could play four sets of bongos at once.

175
00:11:23,161 --> 00:11:28,180
Scott: I think it's a creative way of turning up the difficulty on a game that doesn't have the feature in it already.

176
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,239
Rym: Most definitely.

177
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,740
Rym: Well, it's kind of like the idea we had back with Para Para to stick the five little flower pots on the wall instead of putting them on the floor.

178
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,599
Scott: Mmm, I guess.

179
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:44,160
Scott: There are all sorts of ways, you know, what if we like took a DDR pad and cut up the arrows and moved them around?

180
00:11:45,002 --> 00:11:48,160
Rym: Or like the guy who played the double neck Guitar Heroes.

181
00:11:49,002 --> 00:11:50,339
Scott: Yeah, that was pretty cool.

182
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,620
Rym: So it being gaming day, I've had this sitting around for a while and I thought it was finally worthy of a thing of the day.

183
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,580
Rym: Just for the fact that no one would probably think to look it up on their own.

184
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:08,840
Rym: So, if you were a child of the 80s, there was a cartoon on American TV, and it was on a lot of other nation's TV too, called Dungeons and Dragons.

185
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,432
Scott: Wasn't that a 70s cartoon?

186
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:11,340
Scott: Or am I wrong?

187
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,266
Rym: Well, yeah, it's an old cartoon.

188
00:12:13,286 --> 00:12:16,376
Rym: I don't know when it came out, but I saw it when I was a kid in the 80s.

189
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:17,460
Rym: It was probably reruns.

190
00:12:18,382 --> 00:12:20,556
Rym: I'm not a child of the 70s, so I can't speak for the 70s.

191
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,419
Scott: Yeah, I gotta go look that up.

192
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,747
Rym: Yeah, it doesn't matter.

193
00:12:23,787 --> 00:12:24,494
Rym: I was a child of the 80s.

194
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,920
Rym: And this show was pretty piss poor, I gotta tell ya.

195
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,440
Rym: This was not a good show, and it does not stand the test of time.

196
00:12:33,901 --> 00:12:43,540
Rym: And if you don't believe me, my thing of the day is on YouTube, people have put up some of the openers, the opening segments to this old Dungeons and Dragons cartoon.

197
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:44,356
Scott: Uh oh.

198
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:53,840
Rym: I highly recommend, if you were a child of the 70s, 80s, or 90s, you watch this and take it as a warning to not actually watch that show.

199
00:12:54,722 --> 00:13:04,680
Rym: I mean, some shows have stood the test of time, like Gargoyles was actually pretty cool, and Exo Squad, and to a small degree Thundercats, but then there's shows like He-Man.

200
00:13:05,721 --> 00:13:12,300
Scott: I'm having a hard time finding out what year the D&D cartoon came out in, but overall, it was a terrible freaking cartoon.

201
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,222
Rym: Yeah, good God.

202
00:13:13,282 --> 00:13:20,720
Rym: If you see this opener, and you decide that it would be worth your time to see more of this show, I don't know what to tell you.

203
00:13:21,362 --> 00:13:26,557
Scott: A lot of people have nostalgia for it, just because it's Dungeons and Dragons, or because they saw it in their childhood.

204
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:27,580
Scott: It's bad.

205
00:13:27,901 --> 00:13:30,912
Scott: I'm nostalgic for He-Man, because I liked He-Man when I was a kid.

206
00:13:30,932 --> 00:13:33,100
Scott: I can't watch He-Man now, He-Man is terrible.

207
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,960
Rym: He-Man is one of the worst of the childhood cartoons, I gotta say.

208
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,140
Scott: He-Man is ass.

209
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,840
Rym: I'd rather watch Teddy Ruxpin for a day straight than watch one episode of He-Man.

210
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,580
Scott: Oh good God, I wouldn't watch Teddy Ruxpin either, good God.

211
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:45,419
Rym: Compared to He-Man?

212
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:47,779
Scott: Yeah, even compared to He-Man.

213
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:48,645
Rym: One or the other.

214
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,900
Rym: You would rather watch He-Man than Teddy Ruxpin.

215
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,839
Scott: Yeah, because at least I could laugh at Skeletor.

216
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,040
Rym: What about Gummy Bears?

217
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:56,119
Scott: I never actually watched Gummy Bears.

218
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,680
Rym: Gummy Bears was actually alright.

219
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,939
Scott: Yeah, some people say it was alright, but I'd have to see it, I don't know.

220
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:08,300
Rym: But anyway, we spent the weekend, as we've spent every weekend for the past, I don't know, year, at a convention.

221
00:14:09,485 --> 00:14:10,499
Scott: Oh, it was an 80's cartoon.

222
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,200
Scott: Yeah.

223
00:14:12,604 --> 00:14:12,813
Scott: Hahaha.

224
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:29,721
Rym: So, despite the fact that we are compressorless, and the fact that our power cable is probably either sitting somewhere in the hotel, or perhaps in one of the briefcases or bags of one of the staffers of UberCon, we bring you our coverage of the second UberCon 2006.

225
00:14:29,721 --> 00:14:32,120
Scott: I think it's actually, what, UberCon 8?

226
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:38,140
Rym: I don't remember which number it was, but this was a special UberCon for us because it was the first time we went to UberCon as guests.

227
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:42,040
Scott: Yep, it was UberCon 8, the 8th UberCon ever.

228
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,060
Rym: Yeah, there haven't been so many UberCons, I've realized that I've been to many of them, almost half.

229
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,660
Scott: Yeah, I guess you could say that.

230
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,940
Scott: There are two a year, there's one in October, and there's one in February-ish.

231
00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:01,140
Rym: Yep, basically UberCon starts off the gaming season when it's too cold to go outside, and then it finishes the gaming season when the sun comes back out.

232
00:15:01,421 --> 00:15:09,040
Scott: Yep, and this UberCon was a lot like the last UberCon we went to, only we were guests, and that was what changed the experience.

233
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:26,700
Rym: Well, and actually, 'cause I went to an UberCon the year prior, which is how I, 'cause I didn't even know about UberCon, but I remember one day I was living in the Mid-Hudson Valley, working for IBM, totally alone and bored, and all my friends were still in college, so I look around and I see that there's this gaming con in New Jersey.

234
00:15:27,362 --> 00:15:28,339
Scott: How could you avoid that?

235
00:15:28,982 --> 00:15:35,040
Rym: Yeah, so I go down there, and out of the blue, I end up running into our good friend Ida, who apparently was a guest there.

236
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,359
Scott: Oh, holy crap.

237
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:43,040
Rym: Yeah, and Brian was there, and all these other awesome webcomic artists, 'cause apparently that year they invited all these webcomic artists to be guests.

238
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,460
Scott: Yeah, there aren't so many webcomic artists there anymore, except for some awesome ones we'll talk about real soon.

239
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:49,459
Rym: Yeah, we'll get to that.

240
00:15:50,121 --> 00:16:03,320
Rym: So pretty much, I spent my first UberCon hanging out in the artist alley with all of them, meeting all the webcomic artists I've loved and adored over the years, and of course playing in the Settlers of Catan tournament, which apparently is at every UberCon.

241
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:04,156
Scott: Great.

242
00:16:05,302 --> 00:16:09,020
Rym: I don't think I need to speak on the fact that a Settlers tournament is kinda silly.

243
00:16:09,908 --> 00:16:10,420
Scott: Very silly.

244
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,660
Rym: It's like having a Yahtzee tournament.

245
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:23,260
Scott: They had, believe it or not, I looked on the schedule, late Saturday night there was a Hackmaster tournament game, like a regional entry level game for this tournament.

246
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,326
Rym: See, you can't play Hackmaster in a non-ironic fashion.

247
00:16:26,406 --> 00:16:28,471
Rym: It's not a game that's meant to be taken seriously.

248
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:32,860
Rym: That's like playing Hall dead serious, or trying to play Paranoia straight up.

249
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,216
Scott: Well, Paranoia does have a straight up mode, but it's a different game in that mode.

250
00:16:36,356 --> 00:16:37,160
Scott: It's not the same game.

251
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:44,640
Rym: Yeah, and I don't know if many people have ever pulled off Paranoia straight up, because most people are introduced to it the fun way, and then they stick with it.

252
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,970
Scott: Yeah, I think it's just a different game.

253
00:16:45,991 --> 00:16:46,858
Scott: Whatever.

254
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:57,220
Rym: But anyway, we have a little bit of a history with UberCon, and this UberCon and the previous UberCon and the UberCon before that are all pretty much the exact same con.

255
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,980
Rym: You know exactly what you're going to get.

256
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,925
Scott: And if you like what you're going to get, might as well go!

257
00:17:04,886 --> 00:17:14,940
Scott: What you're going to get is panels that no one goes to, RPGs that are awesome if you sign up for them and get into them, and board gaming all day and all night.

258
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:18,660
Rym: Not only board gaming, but lots and lots of miniature gaming and card gaming.

259
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,804
Scott: Yeah, all that stuff.

260
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,440
Scott: There's not really that much card gaming, but it's there.

261
00:17:23,261 --> 00:17:24,449
Rym: Yeah, there's a lot.

262
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,880
Rym: We don't really go into those rooms.

263
00:17:26,502 --> 00:17:29,373
Scott: Oh, I thought the card gaming was mostly in the same room as the board gaming.

264
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,020
Scott: If it's in a separate room, then I wouldn't see it.

265
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,399
Rym: Well, it is, but it's in other places too.

266
00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:40,400
Rym: Now, it also has a small anime room, an artist alley that has mostly just the guests in it, and some randy people occasionally, though not this year.

267
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,326
Scott: No, they weren't.

268
00:17:41,366 --> 00:17:42,859
Scott: They left a note, "Sorry, we couldn't

269
00:17:42,899 --> 00:17:43,000
Scott: come.".

270
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:44,684
Rym: Kind of too bad.

271
00:17:44,704 --> 00:17:47,080
Rym: I wanted to interview them and then totally make fun of them.

272
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,037
Scott: Oh, that would have been great, yeah.

273
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:55,860
Scott: Because last time we went to UberCon, we weren't guests or podcasters even, so now that we are, it's totally different.

274
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,739
Rym: No, we had just started doing the show.

275
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,374
Scott: Had we?

276
00:17:59,302 --> 00:18:00,419
Rym: I mean, we talked to Luke Crane.

277
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:01,812
Scott: Oh, that's right.

278
00:18:01,852 --> 00:18:02,359
Scott: Yeah, we did.

279
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,684
Rym: Yeah, we talked to Luke Crane.

280
00:18:03,704 --> 00:18:06,877
Rym: We were like, "Hey, can we interview you for our internet talking

281
00:18:07,178 --> 00:18:07,499
Rym: thing?".

282
00:18:08,001 --> 00:18:08,924
Rym: And he was like, "Yeah, whatever,

283
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:09,245
Rym: kids.".

284
00:18:09,646 --> 00:18:13,358
Rym: And we come back a year later, and Luke Crane's like, "Hey, it's you guys.

285
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:13,880
Scott: Awesome.".

286
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,492
Scott: Yeah, and we're like, "We're still doing that thing.

287
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:15,936
Scott: We're better

288
00:18:15,976 --> 00:18:16,178
Scott: now.".

289
00:18:16,601 --> 00:18:18,553
Rym: Yeah, we'll talk about that later.

290
00:18:18,573 --> 00:18:19,720
Rym: We got a great interview with him.

291
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,443
Scott: Yeah, we did.

292
00:18:20,504 --> 00:18:21,712
Scott: Next week you'll hear it, maybe.

293
00:18:21,874 --> 00:18:22,700
Scott: Maybe two weeks from now.

294
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,724
Rym: Now, that's it.

295
00:18:23,864 --> 00:18:26,196
Rym: UberCon is straight up a gaming con.

296
00:18:26,236 --> 00:18:26,899
Rym: You go there.

297
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:33,760
Rym: It's a kind of con where you sign up for events ahead of time, and then you go to them, and every event has slots and someone runs a thing.

298
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:39,160
Scott: And if you're not in an event, you can always go into the big room and play some games.

299
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,300
Rym: In fact, they have a whole thing of board games you can check out with your badge and play.

300
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:45,887
Scott: And they actually had a better system for that this year.

301
00:18:46,248 --> 00:18:50,780
Scott: Last year there was just a rack of games, and you would sign out a piece of paper and take the game.

302
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:57,260
Scott: This year it was the same thing, only the games were behind a desk, so you had to ask someone, so games were harder to steal.

303
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,839
Rym: Which was probably a good thing.

304
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:00,559
Scott: Eh, definitely a good thing.

305
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,459
Rym: It also kept the games much neater.

306
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,460
Scott: It did, but it did make it slightly difficult to get a good look at all the games and pick one out.

307
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:09,420
Rym: It was the same games from last year.

308
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:11,500
Scott: It was, but there were a few new games in there.

309
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:13,979
Rym: If I were them, I'd print out a list of all the games.

310
00:19:14,641 --> 00:19:20,380
Scott: I would print out a list and a description of all the games and have a little computer with BoardGameGeek and all that good stuff.

311
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,060
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, we'll do a little chronology and then we'll stop bit by bit when there's something interesting to talk about.

312
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:34,360
Rym: I mean, we showed up Saturday morning, we only went one day since they definitely weren't going to pay for a hotel, and we're probably going to go to the next UberCon all weekend.

313
00:19:34,701 --> 00:19:36,180
Scott: Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.

314
00:19:36,681 --> 00:19:48,680
Rym: Yeah, so we show up, and now due to the fact that they didn't really give me a lot of specifics as to what was entailed in us being guests, and I was worried, you know, what if they're going to, ah, your you know thing is rubbing off on me.

315
00:19:49,267 --> 00:19:49,414
Scott: Uh oh.

316
00:19:49,702 --> 00:19:50,180
Rym: I said you know.

317
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,900
Scott: Maybe it got on me from someone else.

318
00:19:52,360 --> 00:20:00,560
Scott: I noticed that in a lot of podcasts, I noticed that in a lot of podcasts I listen to today, people didn't say you know as much as I did, but they said it, you know, now and then.

319
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:01,740
Rym: It's a bit of shit.

320
00:20:02,603 --> 00:20:05,320
Scott: Maybe from listening to so many podcasts, that's why I'm saying you know.

321
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:06,079
Rym: Oh man.

322
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:06,819
Scott: It could be.

323
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,040
Rym: Alright, so they gave me, you know, I didn't even know we were going to get in free originally.

324
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:20,220
Rym: Why just, you know, we're going to do this podcasting panel, then they said some other people are going to be on the panel, and I'd talk back and forth a bit, and then UberCon didn't contact me for a while.

325
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:30,140
Rym: And I was a little worried that maybe something went wrong, maybe they're disorganized, I've never worked with the con from this perspective before, whatever, I'll just show up.

326
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:35,320
Rym: And then the day before the con, I get an email with my UberCon member registration as a guest.

327
00:20:36,145 --> 00:20:37,060
Rym: And not one for Scott.

328
00:20:38,384 --> 00:20:41,700
Rym: So I think, whatever, I don't care, and we go to the con.

329
00:20:42,301 --> 00:20:50,740
Rym: And I was worried, you know, maybe they're disorganized, but then I discovered the reason it didn't matter was that it's a small enough con to where they're smart and they don't care.

330
00:20:51,141 --> 00:20:55,360
Rym: So I walked right up, I said, yeah, there's actually two of us here as guests, and they said oh, okay.

331
00:20:55,981 --> 00:21:05,420
Scott: Yeah, and they saw that I was in the database from the previous year, and it seems they just upgraded my status from guy to guest and printed out my badge.

332
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,760
Rym: Yep, for various reasons, I actually have three different entries in their database for the three different times I went.

333
00:21:12,902 --> 00:21:14,239
Rym: For various reasons.

334
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,013
Scott: I think I've managed to get one entry in the database, which is what I want.

335
00:21:18,294 --> 00:21:19,840
Scott: I'd like to have one database entry.

336
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,660
Rym: You want to know how many Oticon registrations I have floating around?

337
00:21:23,962 --> 00:21:26,740
Scott: Yeah, I really want to get all mine merged, but we'll see.

338
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,956
Scott: 'Cause my member ID for Oticon is like 90-something.

339
00:21:30,157 --> 00:21:30,700
Scott: I'm really cool.

340
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,068
Rym: Yeah, your member ID.

341
00:21:32,089 --> 00:21:33,400
Rym: That makes you an awesome, awesome guy.

342
00:21:33,481 --> 00:21:33,764
Rym: It does!

343
00:21:33,784 --> 00:21:35,098
Scott: Two-digit Oticon member ID.

344
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,579
Rym: Yeah, yeah, well I have one of the discontinued associate badges.

345
00:21:39,105 --> 00:21:39,417
Scott: Oh, no.

346
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:48,380
Rym: Yeah, so we get registered, we go in, we try to sign up for Burning Wheel, the four-player, what was it, the something wolves that we wanted to play.

347
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,239
Scott: Surrounded by wolves.

348
00:21:49,644 --> 00:21:50,440
Rym: And it was already full.

349
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:55,596
Scott: It was already full, and we talked to Luke Crane, you know, and he was like, "Yeah, that actually can only hold four

350
00:21:55,636 --> 00:21:55,937
Scott: people.".

351
00:21:56,017 --> 00:21:56,860
Scott: So, oh, oh well.

352
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:05,180
Rym: Yep, because the main reason we went was to bring three of our good friends in the front row crew to play Inheritance with Luke Crane, Burning Wheel.

353
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:14,960
Rym: The same game that last UberCon, we played with Pete, and were so utterly floored by that we all immediately bought all of the books for Burning Wheel as a system.

354
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,700
Scott: Yep, and they successfully played in that game, so it was worth the trip.

355
00:22:19,123 --> 00:22:21,059
Rym: Yep, we'll talk about that game in detail in a bit.

356
00:22:21,621 --> 00:22:23,679
Rym: We're gonna get all the con vinyls out of the way first.

357
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,800
Rym: So then, you know, we dick around, we play a bunch of board games, we played this game called Mesopotamia.

358
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,350
Scott: Yeah, Mesopotamia was an okay game.

359
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,200
Scott: It was a little bit gimmicky, though.

360
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,387
Rym: Yeah, it was gimmicky, but it was fun.

361
00:22:35,427 --> 00:22:38,980
Rym: It was kind of like Tikal, in a fun kind of move things around way.

362
00:22:39,761 --> 00:22:41,765
Scott: It definitely gave me that Tikal feeling.

363
00:22:41,785 --> 00:22:51,040
Scott: We didn't have action points, but you could only perform so many actions each turn, and you were moving around, you were moving around guys, putting more guys on the board.

364
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:57,820
Rym: Dude, the game came with two resources, rocks and wood, and it came with actual, real rocks.

365
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:04,380
Scott: Yeah, there were little tiny rocks, and there were little sticks of wood to represent the rocks and the wood.

366
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,780
Rym: And you physically put them on your little peg and move them around.

367
00:23:07,241 --> 00:23:08,660
Scott: Yeah, kind of crazy.

368
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:10,493
Rym: I would pay up to $25 for that game.

369
00:23:10,553 --> 00:23:11,459
Rym: It was a fun little game.

370
00:23:12,401 --> 00:23:14,064
Scott: Yeah, maybe I'd pay $25 for it.

371
00:23:14,204 --> 00:23:15,728
Scott: Depends on how many times I would play it.

372
00:23:15,768 --> 00:23:16,088
Scott: I don't know.

373
00:23:16,449 --> 00:23:21,820
Scott: Because while it was okay, I can't imagine a time I'd be in the mood to play Mesopotamia.

374
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,300
Rym: I can see playing it with people who are new to board games, basically.

375
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,359
Scott: Maybe, maybe.

376
00:23:27,661 --> 00:23:29,580
Rym: Or just playing it for fun, you know, to move stuff around.

377
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,719
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

378
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,980
Rym: Yeah, we also played Ultra Mare.

379
00:23:33,441 --> 00:23:33,998
Scott: Ultra Mare.

380
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:34,558
Scott: Ultra Mare.

381
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:37,476
Scott: O-L-T-R-E space M-A-R-E.

382
00:23:37,657 --> 00:23:38,160
Scott: Ultra Mare.

383
00:23:38,461 --> 00:23:40,733
Rym: Yeah, we're going to review both of these games on another show.

384
00:23:41,034 --> 00:23:42,160
Rym: This game was fantastic.

385
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,146
Scott: Ultra Mare is an awesome game.

386
00:23:44,227 --> 00:23:47,700
Scott: I had heard things about it on some other board game podcasts and board game geek.

387
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,560
Scott: And I never played it, but I went over to pick, it was my turn to pick out a game.

388
00:23:52,001 --> 00:23:54,417
Scott: And I saw Ultra Mare, so I said, "Alright, let me try

389
00:23:54,478 --> 00:23:54,679
Scott: that.".

390
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,660
Scott: And I got it out, and I was trying to learn it, and it was a little not easy to learn.

391
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,580
Scott: This guy comes up and he teaches it to us, mostly.

392
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,356
Scott: And we figured it out, and we were like, "Hot damn, this game

393
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:05,759
Scott: rocks.".

394
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,440
Rym: Yep, and then there were two cool people at the table, and we played it with them, and it was a pretty good game.

395
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:13,280
Scott: I would pay $30 for that game, but they were selling it for $40 everywhere.

396
00:24:13,941 --> 00:24:18,720
Scott: One place online was selling it for $31, but then they added shipping and handling, and it was almost $40.

397
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,048
Scott: I was like,

398
00:24:19,068 --> 00:24:19,191
Scott: "Ugh.".

399
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,460
Rym: Sometime in the coming months, I'm going to head out to Rochester, so I'll probably stop by Millennium Games and just buy it.

400
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,540
Scott: That sounds like a plan.

401
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
Scott: Oh, we also played the Tigris and Euphrates card game.

402
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:35,100
Rym: Yeah, which was better than expected, but is definitely a gimmick that is riding on the Tigers and Euphrates name.

403
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:49,640
Scott: Yeah, I mean, there was something to it, and as we played the game, a lot more strategies and possibilities emerged, and the game was a lot more complex than it first appeared, but at the same time, it's no Tigris and Euphrates.

404
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,980
Rym: Yeah, though the game really has the same problem that San Juan does.

405
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,880
Rym: Puerto Rico, pretty much one of the best board games ever made.

406
00:24:57,201 --> 00:24:59,799
Rym: Tigers and Euphrates, almost equally good in terms of fun.

407
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,078
Scott: The card-- Add game-ness.

408
00:25:02,261 --> 00:25:05,520
Rym: Yes, the card version of Puerto Rico, San Juan.

409
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,599
Rym: A little bit broken, not the best game.

410
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:11,620
Scott: It's really good and fun, but it's not a Puerto Rico.

411
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:16,160
Rym: Yeah, there's a lot more randomness in that you might just lose because of what you draw.

412
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,579
Scott: There's a chance.

413
00:25:18,241 --> 00:25:22,260
Rym: A much bigger chance than in a game like, well, not really Puerto Rico, but Tigris and Euphrates.

414
00:25:22,681 --> 00:25:23,040
Rym: Yeah.

415
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,220
Rym: Tigris and Euphrates card game suffers from that even more.

416
00:25:25,721 --> 00:25:29,079
Rym: If you just draw the wrong tiles or the wrong cards, there's nothing you can do to win.

417
00:25:30,181 --> 00:25:30,563
Scott: I guess.

418
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:39,460
Scott: I mean, I didn't play it enough to really know that much, but it seemed there was a lot of stuff, and as I played the game, I kept having more and more moments of enlightenment.

419
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,980
Scott: So I want to play it at least once more to see if I can put the pieces together.

420
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,140
Rym: Yeah, I will note that Jess kicked our asses.

421
00:25:46,541 --> 00:25:47,159
Scott: Yeah, she did.

422
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,719
Rym: We all thought we were doing great.

423
00:25:49,061 --> 00:25:58,898
Scott: If that shows you anything about this game is that we were thinking really hard, and I don't know, she didn't seem like she didn't have much T&E experience.

424
00:25:58,918 --> 00:25:59,460
Scott: Maybe that helped.

425
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:10,400
Rym: Well, the problem was we forgot that she hadn't played Tigris and Euphrates before, so we just started playing this game because it has mostly the same rules and totally didn't teach her how to play, and yet she won.

426
00:26:10,981 --> 00:26:12,451
Scott: Yeah, so good, bad, who knows?

427
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:21,960
Rym: I think what happened, and I don't want to go into detail on this, was that basically we were trying to apply Tigris and Euphrates strategies to this game.

428
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:27,020
Rym: Because she had never played Tigris and Euphrates, she applied the obvious strategy to the game.

429
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,977
Rym: The obvious strategy--.

430
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,320
Scott: Well, that's what you always say.

431
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,980
Scott: When you play a game for the first time, you go for the obvious strategy.

432
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:34,738
Rym: Yeah, and you know what?

433
00:26:35,081 --> 00:26:37,500
Rym: It almost always works the first time you play a game with people.

434
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,540
Scott: Unless you're playing against people who already know how to play.

435
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,740
Rym: But we thought we knew how to play and we didn't, so I didn't use the obvious strategy.

436
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:50,260
Scott: If this same card game did not have a Tigris and Euphrates theme, we probably all would have used the obvious strategy.

437
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,279
Rym: Yeah, it was an okay game.

438
00:26:53,327 --> 00:26:55,258
Scott: And other than that-- I don't know, I'd pay ten bucks for it.

439
00:26:55,762 --> 00:26:56,020
Scott: Maybe.

440
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,754
Scott: The thing is, it's one of those card games that comes in a box.

441
00:26:59,795 --> 00:27:01,000
Scott: that doesn't need to come in a box.

442
00:27:01,461 --> 00:27:02,659
Scott: It could just be a card game.

443
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,340
Scott: It's the same thing against me about San Juan.

444
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,359
Scott: San Juan should really just be a deck of cards.

445
00:27:08,102 --> 00:27:10,440
Scott: But they sell it in his box to jack up the price.

446
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,939
Rym: Yeah, we can talk about all that when we talk about these games.

447
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,080
Rym: Because I don't want to turn our review of the con into a review of the games we played there.

448
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,720
Scott: Yeah, me either.

449
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:20,300
Rym: Yeah, so also, quick aside, we met some of our listeners.

450
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,039
Rym: It was awesome to meet you.

451
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:26,440
Rym: Once again proving that all of our listeners that we've met in person have been awesome to some degree.

452
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,330
Scott: Hey listeners, what's up?

453
00:27:29,855 --> 00:27:30,240
Scott: You're cool.

454
00:27:33,663 --> 00:27:35,800
Rym: And then we had our panel.

455
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,200
Scott: Okay, this panel is kind of weird because we're not used to sharing a panel.

456
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,599
Rym: Well, yeah, the thing is, I said, "Hey, we'd like to do a podcasting

457
00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:45,880
Rym: panel.".

458
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,091
Rym: And they said, "Oh great, we want a podcasting panel.

459
00:27:48,111 --> 00:27:49,518
Rym: We were just about to try to put one

460
00:27:49,538 --> 00:27:49,860
Rym: together.".

461
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:55,119
Rym: And then a couple weeks later I get an email, "Would it be okay if you shared your panel with some

462
00:27:55,139 --> 00:27:55,400
Rym: people?".

463
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,420
Rym: And they list all these people.

464
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:01,359
Rym: And I had no idea who these people were and I Googled them and I still didn't know who they were.

465
00:28:02,201 --> 00:28:04,258
Scott: One guy, I kind of knew who he was.

466
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,540
Scott: Possibly because he's a New York Times bestselling author.

467
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:13,260
Rym: Yeah, the panel might have been okay, but I mean, it's UberCon and no one went to the panel at all.

468
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:18,420
Scott: There was one person at the panel who was not our friend and was not a panelist.

469
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:23,620
Rym: Yeah, more than 50% of the audience for most of the panel was Jess and Katsu.

470
00:28:24,081 --> 00:28:27,900
Scott: Yeah, and the panel was larger than the attendees.

471
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:28,601
Rym: Yes.

472
00:28:29,486 --> 00:28:32,220
Rym: It also had many more people than even UberCon said would be on it.

473
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:36,100
Rym: And one of them wasn't even talking about podcasting, he was talking about videocasting.

474
00:28:37,941 --> 00:28:42,440
Rym: And I guess the one thing, we don't have much to say about the panel because we just kind of sat there.

475
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:44,938
Rym: No one really seemed interested in what we had to say.

476
00:28:45,882 --> 00:28:46,827
Scott: The one person.

477
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,240
Scott: I think it was mostly the other podcasters.

478
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:53,440
Scott: You know, they wanted to talk a lot about whatever they were thinking.

479
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,557
Rym: Yeah, which was mostly...

480
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,300
Scott: We just didn't care.

481
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:02,020
Rym: They were talking mostly about how to monetize and make money off a podcast and then detailed descriptions of the equipment they use.

482
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:03,840
Scott: Yeah, their crap equipment.

483
00:29:07,342 --> 00:29:11,120
Scott: So, yeah, there was only one person at the panel, so what did we care?

484
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:17,380
Scott: We handed out our flyers, we left, we got in for free, and all we had to do was sit there for an hour and listen to some other people.

485
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:26,880
Rym: Yeah, now the thing is we wanted to run game events and such, and UberCon said they'd get back with us and they never did, so they effectively just paid us to go to UberCon and not do anything but have fun on our own.

486
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,599
Scott: I think next time we're definitely going to push for more game events.

487
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:32,017
Rym: Yeah, I think...

488
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,540
Scott: Because panels at UberCon are basically useless, it seems.

489
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,340
Rym: Yeah, there are two kinds of panels at UberCon.

490
00:29:37,722 --> 00:29:41,100
Rym: A meet and greet for someone who's famous, which will get some people.

491
00:29:41,623 --> 00:29:43,399
Rym: Or any other panel, which will have no one.

492
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,300
Scott: Yeah, I mean, let's get to the next bit.

493
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:54,080
Scott: The guy, Rich Burlew from Order of the Stick was there as a guest, and he was pretty much the guest that everyone cared about, and he's awesome.

494
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,760
Rym: Yeah, we are huge fans of Order of the Stick.

495
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,920
Rym: I highly recommend that you read it if you would all like Dungeons & Dragons.

496
00:30:01,581 --> 00:30:04,880
Rym: Even if you don't, it's a solid comic that stands up on its own.

497
00:30:05,181 --> 00:30:09,500
Scott: Yeah, it's a solid comic that stands up on its own, but has lots and lots of D&D jokes.

498
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,540
Rym: But it also has non-D&D jokes.

499
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,300
Rym: Kind of like how people who don't play modern video games can still enjoy Penny Arcade.

500
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,040
Scott: It's kind of like that, exactly.

501
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:24,020
Scott: But yeah, he was there, and he was selling his new board game, which I didn't play, so I can't talk about it.

502
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,500
Rym: Alex played it, so we'll probably get him on the show at some point.

503
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,495
Scott: Yeah, but I don't want to talk about something on the show.

504
00:30:28,515 --> 00:30:29,120
Scott: I haven't played it.

505
00:30:30,446 --> 00:30:32,720
Scott: It was 40 bucks, or I would have bought it if it was less.

506
00:30:33,941 --> 00:30:38,000
Rym: Now, of course, he had pins and buttons and his new book for sale.

507
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,820
Scott: Yeah, I bought the new book because I already had books 0 and 1, so why not buy book 2?

508
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,379
Scott: That is my first opportunity to get it.

509
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,060
Rym: He sold out of Xicon buttons a long time ago, apparently.

510
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:50,470
Scott: Grrr, I wanted my Xicon button.

511
00:30:50,631 --> 00:30:50,912
Scott: Oh well.

512
00:30:51,676 --> 00:30:52,340
Scott: Can't get everything.

513
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:56,880
Scott: And his panels were well attended, even though they were not attended by me because I was doing other things.

514
00:30:57,521 --> 00:30:59,640
Scott: And I saw him at his dealer table, which is cool enough.

515
00:31:00,042 --> 00:31:01,439
Rym: Yeah, he's a cool guy to talk to.

516
00:31:01,942 --> 00:31:05,280
Scott: Yeah, very friendly, very awesome with his comic making.

517
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:12,220
Rym: Though, honestly, I've never met a popular author of a webcomic who was not a cool guy to talk to.

518
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:17,560
Rym: I mean, as much as we make fun of Fred Gallagher in Mega Tokyo, he's still a pretty cool guy to talk to if you're on into him.

519
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,172
Scott: Yeah, it seems like comic creators are generally friendly and cool.

520
00:31:21,192 --> 00:31:23,420
Scott: They're very easy people to talk to.

521
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,737
Scott: You're not going to--it's going to be rare that you find a comic creator, writer, artist.

522
00:31:28,978 --> 00:31:29,520
Scott: that's an ass.

523
00:31:29,802 --> 00:31:30,858
Scott: It's like, go away, grrr.

524
00:31:31,161 --> 00:31:35,840
Scott: The most I've run into is-- And if they are an ass, it's very likely their comic sucks and you don't want to read it.

525
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:39,360
Rym: Yeah, well the most I've run into is some people are really, really, really shy.

526
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,980
Scott: Some of them are very shy, but people who are shy tend to not get dealer tables and artist tables and things like that.

527
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:47,279
Scott: Unless they're forced into it.

528
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,919
Rym: Yep, they often are.

529
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:49,640
Scott: Sometimes.

530
00:31:50,360 --> 00:32:00,197
Rym: So aside from that, kind of an outside of the con issue, but every year, right next to the con, there was a mall with a really, really, really good food court that had great food.

531
00:32:00,277 --> 00:32:00,940
Rym: I always ate there.

532
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,800
Scott: You gotta understand that this is right near Giant Stadium in New Jersey.

533
00:32:06,362 --> 00:32:08,579
Scott: There's Secaucus, New Jersey is this town.

534
00:32:09,621 --> 00:32:11,526
Scott: And this is Expo Center.

535
00:32:11,707 --> 00:32:16,420
Scott: The Expo Center is like a little mini convention center that Anime Next uses for part of its convention.

536
00:32:16,961 --> 00:32:31,760
Scott: And around that Expo Center are many hotels, offices, restaurants, a whole bunch of crap, mostly to support the Giant Stadium area and also the businesses that are just down the road.

537
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,739
Rym: But there's nothing else.

538
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,120
Scott: Oh, there's a New Jersey train station, I think.

539
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,180
Rym: Yeah, there's nothing else.

540
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,779
Scott: And a commuter stop and that's it.

541
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:44,660
Scott: It's this little area that's sort of surrounded by Jersey divider roads that has hotels and crap.

542
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:50,320
Rym: I mean, it wasn't really that much better than being, you know, in Utica, New York.

543
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,616
Scott: No, it really wasn't.

544
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,780
Scott: And one part of this place has a mall.

545
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,118
Scott: And this mall, you know, we went there last year to eat and it has a food court.

546
00:33:00,138 --> 00:33:00,460
Scott: that's good.

547
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,890
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I've eaten there several times.

548
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:05,240
Rym: My last two previous UberCons, it was great.

549
00:33:05,341 --> 00:33:07,440
Rym: So we figure, you know, we're going to go get good food there.

550
00:33:07,989 --> 00:33:08,338
Rym: We go.

551
00:33:09,442 --> 00:33:10,820
Rym: The mall is going out of business.

552
00:33:10,961 --> 00:33:14,620
Rym: All the stores are shut down except for a few scraggly hangers on.

553
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:19,820
Scott: Yeah, it's like, I'd say 66% of the stores in the mall were just closed.

554
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,420
Rym: Boarded up with rubble inside.

555
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,799
Scott: Yeah, I mean, they had the chain gates down and locked and that was it.

556
00:33:25,161 --> 00:33:27,039
Scott: The GameStop EV was still open.

557
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,180
Rym: Yep, barely.

558
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,119
Scott: Half the food court was open.

559
00:33:30,501 --> 00:33:31,316
Rym: Yeah, the bad half.

560
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,599
Scott: The KV Toys was open, but everything was clearing out.

561
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,354
Scott: They had like a buy one, get one half off sale.

562
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,666
Rym: Yeah, whatever, no one cares about that.

563
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:42,900
Rym: The point is, there's nowhere to eat lunch anymore at this convention.

564
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:51,300
Scott: So we had to drive around this whole expo center area to get to the place we ate at Anime Next.

565
00:33:51,841 --> 00:33:52,580
Rym: Yeah, some restaurant.

566
00:33:52,880 --> 00:34:00,880
Scott: Because Anime Next and Manga Next are on the other side of the place and UberCon is in a hotel on the other side of this road.

567
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,980
Rym: So I don't know what the deal is, but just be warned that there's no longer anywhere to get a good lunch at the con.

568
00:34:07,283 --> 00:34:08,579
Scott: Except for the place that we ate.

569
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,279
Rym: That's kind of far away, you can't just walk to it.

570
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,838
Scott: Yeah, you have to drive to it, but it is good.

571
00:34:15,121 --> 00:34:16,900
Scott: Burger, hamburger in paradise, right?

572
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,040
Rym: Yeah, it doesn't matter, it's over there.

573
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:19,456
Scott: Yeah.

574
00:34:20,021 --> 00:34:22,556
Rym: Of course, also, actually, one nice thing- There's an Outback, too.

575
00:34:23,302 --> 00:34:24,339
Rym: Which isn't open for lunch.

576
00:34:24,704 --> 00:34:25,120
Scott: Oh, right.

577
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:25,364
Scott: Yeah.

578
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,576
Scott: Bastards, I forgot that.

579
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:33,420
Rym: But at least the con seems to have mitigated this by having a super cheap lunch dinner thing in the con.

580
00:34:33,601 --> 00:34:37,560
Rym: You can buy a hamburger or a hot dog and a bunch of stuff for like two or three bucks.

581
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,440
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty cool, compared to other conventions, which super overpriced the con food.

582
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:48,020
Scott: They just sold normal, I mean, it probably wasn't the greatest food, but- No, I've eaten it before, it wasn't that bad.

583
00:34:48,302 --> 00:34:48,739
Scott: Yeah, cool.

584
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:53,260
Scott: And also, a lot of people at UberCon call out for pizza in Chinese.

585
00:34:53,704 --> 00:34:54,460
Scott: A whole lot.

586
00:34:54,900 --> 00:35:01,520
Scott: And I noticed, actually, at the UberCon help desk, they had menus for all the restaurants for people to call out to.

587
00:35:01,701 --> 00:35:03,359
Rym: You know, every hotel has that.

588
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,400
Scott: No, no, no, at the UberCon desk.

589
00:35:06,084 --> 00:35:07,079
Scott: Not at the hotel desk.

590
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,080
Scott: UberCon actually collected these things and provided them to attendees.

591
00:35:12,602 --> 00:35:13,419
Rym: That's nice of them.

592
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,879
Scott: Yeah, I mean, they had some foresight there.

593
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:24,120
Scott: Well, UberCon's generally a pretty well-run convention because- Well, when you run the same convention eight times in a row, you'll learn something new every time and you can prepare for it the next year.

594
00:35:25,181 --> 00:35:27,480
Scott: You can just keep making things a little bit better, a little bit better.

595
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:36,360
Rym: So while we were doing all that running around, Jess, Katsu, and Alex went to play Inheritance with Luke Crane, Burning Wheel, Viking Funeral.

596
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:40,600
Scott: Yep, it is a game which we had previously played in the year before.

597
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,580
Scott: Well, not the year before, less than a year before.

598
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,800
Rym: Yeah, the previous UberCon.

599
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,699
Scott: The game that made us go, "Holy shit, Burning Wheel is the best RPG, oh my

600
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:47,900
Scott: god.".

601
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,700
Rym: Yes, you probably want to listen to our previous episodes about Burning Wheel if you want to hear more about the system.

602
00:35:52,760 --> 00:36:00,580
Rym: And also, probably next week, or maybe because next week is Halloween, the week after that, we have the interview that we did with Luke Crane.

603
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:04,280
Rym: Because we went to make sure that our friends would all be in the Inheritance game.

604
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:11,540
Rym: The point of all of our friends coming was nothing more than so they could play in this game with Luke Crane to see how Burning Wheel works.

605
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,700
Scott: Yeah, because we had already played the game, and our friend Pete, who didn't go, had already played in the game.

606
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,980
Scott: But we had three of our other friends who were big role players had not played Burning Wheel.

607
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:32,280
Scott: And while some of them had read the books on our bequest, they didn't actually know, they didn't have the full "Luke Crane experience" as they call it.

608
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:39,520
Scott: So they didn't know first hand how awesome it was, and we could explain it to them, but you don't know until you're there.

609
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,060
Scott: So they got to play in it and see what we were talking about, and we were not shit talkers.

610
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:49,079
Rym: Now I'll say this, when we played Burning Wheel and Inheritance the first time, we were at the con, we were playing it.

611
00:36:49,702 --> 00:36:54,980
Rym: And throughout the second half of the game, because the game lasts four hours, like a solid four hours.

612
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:59,876
Scott: Well any decent, even a one shot of a simple RPG is going to take a while.

613
00:37:00,337 --> 00:37:01,060
Scott: That's sort of the point.

614
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,419
Scott: If it's real quick, then you're not getting much out of it.

615
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:16,136
Rym: Well yeah, but the point is we were there, and I remember that while we were playing, about an hour to 45 minutes before the end, people started coming up and they'd go up to Luke and they'd ask things like, "Did it happen yet?

616
00:37:16,256 --> 00:37:16,858
Rym: Did you read it

617
00:37:16,918 --> 00:37:17,099
Rym: yet?".

618
00:37:18,223 --> 00:37:19,012
Rym: "Tell us when it's going to

619
00:37:19,052 --> 00:37:19,315
Rym: happen.".

620
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:24,780
Rym: And then a crowd gathered around the game right before the will of the Viking father was read.

621
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,012
Rym: And then there was chaos in the game, and then the crowd was like,

622
00:37:28,092 --> 00:37:29,036
Rym: "Ahaha!".

623
00:37:30,061 --> 00:37:39,200
Rym: So then we played the game and we realized what was going on, so this time, our friends were in the game, we came about a half hour before it ended and watched the second half to see the craziness.

624
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:43,900
Scott: Yeah, it was kind of surprising how different their game was from ours.

625
00:37:44,301 --> 00:37:52,838
Scott: I didn't get all the details because I wasn't super paying attention, but I could tell very obviously what was going on, and it was way wrong.

626
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:53,860
Scott: Way wrong.

627
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:58,800
Scott: Yeah, to not ruin this, because if you- Well I guess it's an RPG, you can't be wrong, but it was wrong.

628
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,159
Rym: If you ever have the chance to play Inheritance with Luke Crane or anyone running it in Burning Wheel, do it.

629
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:20,780
Rym: But our game ended with pretty much everyone happy, everything resolved, the family was stronger than ever, closer than ever, everything was beautiful, and the Christian missionary had been hung for his horrible atrocities.

630
00:38:22,361 --> 00:38:22,942
Rym: And that was it.

631
00:38:23,564 --> 00:38:40,320
Rym: And at the end of their game, everyone was miserable, the family was broken in two asunder, they had basically exiled their only hope of salvation, everyone distrusted each other, and then the guy played by Katsu ended up trying to steal the honor of the female lead.

632
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:54,440
Scott: Yeah, that shows you something that was going on in that game, because Katsu's character, to be honest, isn't really a major character, he's not a big player in the game, yet to have do such a big thing, you know, well, it's like, whoa.

633
00:38:55,282 --> 00:39:01,020
Rym: It wasn't just that, the game went just completely differently, which was interesting considering that it's the exact same setup.

634
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:07,080
Rym: The game starts the same way, the characters are all identical every time, it's just how you play them.

635
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:12,020
Scott: Yeah, very very cool, just another example of the awesomeness that is the Burning Wheel.

636
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:31,260
Rym: Yep, so of course after the game we talked to Luke, we all went over by the bar, because that was the place to hang out, not Japanese awesome karaoke, not nerdy time warp karaoke, but drunken bar karaoke.

637
00:39:32,802 --> 00:39:33,476
Scott: Bad karaoke.

638
00:39:34,302 --> 00:39:35,538
Rym: Sad karaoke.

639
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,159
Scott: Very bad karaoke.

640
00:39:40,501 --> 00:39:45,080
Rym: So we just found another place to hang out, and then we talked to Luke for a while and all of his friends.

641
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:50,720
Scott: Yeah, we also hung out with, I think the guys from Artesia were there, the guys who publish Mouse Guard and a bunch of other comics.

642
00:39:50,961 --> 00:40:01,980
Rym: Yeah, and we talked a lot about, you know, they go to a very different set of conventions from us, so they told us about the conventions they go to, and we told them about the conventions we go to, and I think we're gonna hook up with them at some conventions in the near future.

643
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:12,060
Scott: Yeah, I made them laugh, which is pretty impressive, because these are like serious comic publishing dudes, and they didn't say go away fanboy, which means ahaha, I got something.

644
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:16,860
Rym: Yep, but more importantly then, we sat down with Luke and, oh god I feel so bad, what was the other guy's name?

645
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,479
Rym: Thar... It's in the interview.

646
00:40:20,322 --> 00:40:21,492
Scott: Thor, Thor, Thor.

647
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,700
Rym: Good enough, good enough, stop there, don't dig a hole.

648
00:40:25,443 --> 00:40:27,260
Scott: Ulfsson, he had a viking name.

649
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,779
Rym: He did, he was very viking in demeanor too.

650
00:40:30,841 --> 00:40:34,680
Rym: And we got an absolutely fantastic interview with Luke Crane.

651
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:39,280
Rym: You are really gonna wanna hear this, and we'll put it up sometime in the next two weeks.

652
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:46,480
Scott: Yeah, I think we're definitely gonna start doing more interviews next year, but we're not gonna go crazy, because a lot of other podcasts go interview nuts.

653
00:40:47,123 --> 00:40:55,000
Rym: Well we've got a bunch lined up that we just never followed through with for various reasons, but we're gonna get the video game pianist if we can, since he really wanted to do an interview.

654
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:59,100
Rym: We'll probably talk to Entertainment System, because that would just be fun I'll bet.

655
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:04,520
Scott: Yeah, we'll get a bunch of interviews, but maybe one a week, one every other week, something like that.

656
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,080
Rym: Yeah, at most, it's not gonna become interviews with Rym and Scott.

657
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:15,499
Scott: Yeah, that would suck actually, because then you would never hear us talk, and if you're listening to this show, and this isn't your first time listening, you're listening because you like hearing us.

658
00:41:16,222 --> 00:41:21,460
Scott: And in an interview, the thing we wanna do is hear the other guy, the guy we're interviewing, you don't wanna hear us.

659
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:26,280
Scott: So if it was just interviews, then we become irrelevant, anyone could do the interviews.

660
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,500
Rym: But all in all, UberCon was, as usual, exactly what we expected.

661
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,080
Rym: It was a fantastic con for us, because we played a million board games and talked to Luke.

662
00:41:34,801 --> 00:41:37,940
Rym: It was a fantastic con for the rest of the crew, because they got to play inheritance.

663
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,017
Rym: Though I'll warn you, a lot of times, I mean we recommend a con, and people say "Oh

664
00:41:43,037 --> 00:41:43,218
Rym: great!"

665
00:41:43,258 --> 00:41:43,600
Rym: and they go.

666
00:41:44,661 --> 00:41:47,720
Rym: UberCon is a great con, but don't be under any illusions.

667
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:57,140
Rym: If you don't wanna sit down and play German board games and play role-playing games all day, there is nothing for you at this con.

668
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:05,480
Scott: Yeah, if you go to an anime con, like Otakon, or even a smaller anime con, say Anime Next, you can do a lot of things there.

669
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:11,380
Scott: You can shop, you can cosplay, you can take pictures, you can go to panels, you can play video games.

670
00:42:12,122 --> 00:42:14,530
Scott: You can do all sorts of shit.

671
00:42:15,212 --> 00:42:17,600
Scott: So if you get bored of one activity, you can move to another.

672
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:25,800
Scott: At a gaming con, like UberCon, especially a small gaming con, all you can really do is, there's a little land party area, sponsored by Nvidia.

673
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,432
Scott: And there's a little tiny video game area, really tiny.

674
00:42:29,533 --> 00:42:31,380
Scott: You can play Guitar Hero or Smash Brothers.

675
00:42:32,221 --> 00:42:46,880
Scott: But the majority of the convention is, frickin' play board games, play miniatures games, play RPGs, from Friday night to all day Friday through all day Sunday and all day Saturday.

676
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,484
Scott: And that's all there is.

677
00:42:48,946 --> 00:42:53,460
Scott: So unless you're ready to play lots of games, you're going to be very bored at the convention.

678
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,377
Scott: And it's not cheap to get in.

679
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,453
Rym: No it's not!

680
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:01,059
Scott: No, it's actually quite expensive to go to a gaming convention like this.

681
00:43:01,481 --> 00:43:08,460
Rym: Of course, it's better than a lot of gaming cons that aren't expensive to get in, but then you have to pay like four dollars for every event you sign up for.

682
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,025
Scott: Yeah, actually I prefer the UberCon way.

683
00:43:12,065 --> 00:43:19,460
Scott: I'd rather pay forty bucks, or sixty bucks, and be able to play any game I want, than have to pay for every single freaking game.

684
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,367
Rym: Yep, that's very much the Otakon philosophy.

685
00:43:21,487 --> 00:43:24,820
Rym: Never should you have to pay for anything more than getting into our doors.

686
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,780
Scott: Yeah, I think that's the way all amusement parks should work also.

687
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,323
Rym: Now also, two nice things.

688
00:43:29,664 --> 00:43:37,660
Rym: One thing that UberCon does for all the people there is that they will give you all of the Amp energy drink and all of the fortified milk that you can drink.

689
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,640
Rym: Unlimited access.

690
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:45,360
Scott: Well, at night they stop filling the coolers, but during the day they have these big tubs full of ice water.

691
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:51,419
Scott: And floating in the ice water are these milk chiller things that are like chocolate milk and strawberry milk.

692
00:43:52,462 --> 00:43:55,100
Scott: And Amp energy drinks.

693
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,598
Rym: I had about nine Amps.

694
00:43:57,445 --> 00:43:59,579
Scott: Did you see that RPG that was going on diagonally?

695
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,920
Rym: Oh god, that group of people combined had drunk like forty or fifty of those things.

696
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:09,471
Scott: They just filled their table with Amps, and then when their game was over they took pictures of all of them.

697
00:44:09,832 --> 00:44:13,000
Scott: I'm surprised they didn't die, or start having seizures over there.

698
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,818
Rym: If I have more than one or two Red Bulls in short succession...

699
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,940
Scott: Well, Red Bull I think is more powerful than Amp.

700
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,880
Rym: Yes it is, but my heart...

701
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,360
Scott: Isn't Amp just like double Mountain Dew?

702
00:44:20,781 --> 00:44:22,109
Rym: Yeah, Amp is just double Mountain Dew.

703
00:44:22,149 --> 00:44:23,940
Rym: Red Bull has a lot of other things in it.

704
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,379
Scott: See, I don't even drink this shit, but I know.

705
00:44:25,761 --> 00:44:26,804
Rym: The other thing is, I don't like Amp.

706
00:44:26,904 --> 00:44:29,933
Rym: Amp tastes like a concentrated Mountain Dew Slurpee.

707
00:44:31,017 --> 00:44:32,120
Rym: Or Slushie, if you will.

708
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,320
Scott: What does Red Bull taste like?

709
00:44:33,641 --> 00:44:34,667
Rym: Red Bull just tastes good.

710
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:37,000
Rym: It doesn't taste like cough medicine.

711
00:44:37,221 --> 00:44:38,260
Scott: It smells like cough medicine.

712
00:44:39,261 --> 00:44:40,244
Rym: It's hard to describe.

713
00:44:40,325 --> 00:44:40,927
Rym: I like it though.

714
00:44:41,007 --> 00:44:44,740
Rym: I really like the taste of Red Bull, and I drink it more often than I probably should.

715
00:44:45,142 --> 00:44:46,959
Scott: You probably do drink it more often than you should.

716
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:54,760
Rym: And I will say that Scott Johnson and I, we don't drink often, but Red Bull in vodka is rapidly becoming one of my favorite drinks.

717
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,200
Rym: I mean, right there with my old man drinks, like my Manhattan.

718
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:04,460
Rym: That reminds me, the bartender at UberCon had no idea how to make real drinks.

719
00:45:05,026 --> 00:45:05,260
Rym: Alright.

720
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,400
Rym: She knew how to make, you know, like she could get you a beer.

721
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,640
Rym: And she was making, you know, like normal whatever drinks that people, gamers were drinking.

722
00:45:14,202 --> 00:45:19,059
Rym: I tried to order a Manhattan, and I got a blank look followed by her slipping around the back and looking it up in a book.

723
00:45:20,581 --> 00:45:25,660
Rym: And then she didn't, she still screwed it up and she basically gave me a Tom Collins glass full of Jack Daniels.

724
00:45:26,984 --> 00:45:27,278
Scott: Great.

725
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,720
Rym: Yeah, that was just wonderful.

726
00:45:29,203 --> 00:45:29,457
Scott: Awesome.

727
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:32,639
Scott: How much of it did you drink?

728
00:45:33,023 --> 00:45:33,435
Rym: All of it.

729
00:45:34,287 --> 00:45:34,539
Scott: Awesome.

730
00:45:34,741 --> 00:45:36,099
Rym: Over the course of two hours.

731
00:45:36,682 --> 00:45:37,539
Scott: Oh, well, that's fun.

732
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,840
Rym: Yeah, I'm gonna chug effectively a quarter bottle of Jack Daniels.

733
00:45:41,522 --> 00:45:43,419
Rym: That would have been a fantastic idea.

734
00:45:43,881 --> 00:45:49,517
Scott: I do have to say, this convention was definitely cool for me because I played three or four new board games.

735
00:45:51,242 --> 00:45:52,539
Scott: I love playing new board games.

736
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,300
Scott: Even if it's a crap game, I'll play any board game once if I haven't played it before.

737
00:45:56,842 --> 00:45:59,120
Scott: Because learning it is fun even if the game is crap.

738
00:45:59,562 --> 00:46:00,218
Rym: We got in free.

739
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,940
Scott: We got in free, and my interview skills went from crap to awesome.

740
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:12,220
Rym: Yes, I mean, normally I'd make fun of Scott, as you all seem to think I do all the time, which we make fun of each other pretty equally.

741
00:46:13,226 --> 00:46:17,560
Rym: The interview started out kind of eh, but- It's like I couldn't get the ball rolling.

742
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:23,140
Scott: I was like, must- Because my goal was, here is this guy, I know he has awesome and entertaining things to say.

743
00:46:23,522 --> 00:46:25,179
Scott: I must make him say those things.

744
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,399
Scott: And that was all I was trying to do the whole time.

745
00:46:27,941 --> 00:46:29,200
Scott: And I started out stupidly.

746
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,258
Scott: I was like, duh.

747
00:46:30,641 --> 00:46:31,257
Scott: Where are you from?

748
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:32,263
Scott: Duh.

749
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:33,145
Rym: Yep.

750
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:37,560
Rym: I'd gone around a lot with the recordy bit at other cons interviewing random people.

751
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:44,460
Rym: And then listening to my own interviews, which started out painful, and then got better as I figured out what to say and what not to say.

752
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:52,400
Scott: And about five minutes of going, uh, I got him to say one intelligent thing, and then I was just, from there I didn't screw up.

753
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,286
Rym: Well, that man can talk.

754
00:46:54,326 --> 00:46:57,420
Rym: You get him on a roll, as long as he's still facing the microphone.

755
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:01,760
Scott: It was sort of like this snowball, and I just had to roll it a bit down the hill, and then I was all good.

756
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:05,980
Rym: Well, plus it helped, and a little tidbit, a little hint to what's coming up in this awesome interview.

757
00:47:06,742 --> 00:47:12,260
Rym: We got to a point where we discovered that Luke Crane and his friend are really into metal.

758
00:47:12,661 --> 00:47:14,540
Scott: They're fucking metal, god damn.

759
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:22,700
Rym: They are more metal than us, and the only reason I knew even half of the bands they mentioned was because Pete has mentioned them and played them for us in the past.

760
00:47:24,553 --> 00:47:24,835
Scott: Yeah.

761
00:47:24,855 --> 00:47:25,360
Scott: So, awesome.

762
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:26,001
Rym: Yes.

763
00:47:27,006 --> 00:47:29,940
Rym: Our group, I think, would get along just fine with the Luke Crane group.

764
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,004
Scott: Yeah.

765
00:47:31,165 --> 00:47:33,259
Scott: Luke Crane also doesn't drink like me, which is cool.

766
00:47:34,201 --> 00:47:34,559
Scott: So, hey.

767
00:47:34,904 --> 00:47:36,260
Rym: As opposed to me and Scott Johnson.

768
00:47:37,761 --> 00:47:38,144
Scott: Alright.

769
00:47:39,091 --> 00:47:40,280
Scott: Are we done talking about UberCon?

770
00:47:40,922 --> 00:47:42,659
Scott: Last but not least- New Jersey sucks.

771
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:44,003
Rym: No, no.

772
00:47:44,043 --> 00:47:44,830
Rym: New Jersey's nice.

773
00:47:44,911 --> 00:47:46,040
Rym: New Jersey roads suck.

774
00:47:46,542 --> 00:47:48,080
Scott: New Jersey also sucks a bit.

775
00:47:48,903 --> 00:47:49,084
Rym: Why?

776
00:47:49,265 --> 00:47:50,209
Rym: I got nothing against Jersey.

777
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:50,752
Rym: I like Jersey.

778
00:47:50,812 --> 00:47:52,280
Rym: I just don't like driving in Jersey.

779
00:47:52,865 --> 00:47:53,140
Scott: Anyway.

780
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:59,080
Rym: But also, UberCon, I mean, most cons we go to when we're guests, they don't give as much other than a free in, or maybe they pay for the hotel.

781
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:08,380
Rym: Animazement probably has the best package of all with the crazy party at the end, but UberCon gave us these really nice UberCon bags full of various goodies.

782
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:14,020
Scott: Yeah, we got the bags that con attendees get, which are pretty good, considering there's an amp in there.

783
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,920
Rym: Well, the thing is, the bag they put it in- They get, there's like a Riff's book in there.

784
00:48:18,221 --> 00:48:20,359
Rym: Yeah, but the bag they put it in was a fancy bag.

785
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:28,520
Scott: Yeah, the guest bag, you get some of the same stuff as the con attendee bag, but you get other stuff, too, that's awesomer.

786
00:48:28,762 --> 00:48:30,440
Rym: Yeah, the patrician benefits.

787
00:48:32,381 --> 00:48:38,400
Rym: But actually, unlike a lot of anime cons, since the anime industry has been kind of slumping, you get a lot of good stuff in the UberCon bag.

788
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,380
Rym: They get a lot of sponsorships that really fit with gaming.

789
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:44,860
Rym: I mean, a Slim Jim, some caffeinated gum, and an amp soda.

790
00:48:45,782 --> 00:48:47,199
Scott: Yeah, sounds cool to me.

791
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:59,020
Scott: I think it's just that there's a lot of companies that have to do with gaming, especially when you include the RPG companies, the collectible card companies, the board game companies- The caffeine companies.

792
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:10,680
Scott: The video game companies, you know, you're covering a lot more industries, so it's easier to get a sponsor, because if one industry is lacking, you can just get the other industries to give more stuff.

793
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:19,660
Scott: The anime cons, you pretty much have this one set of companies, and they don't seem to be putting out as much as they used to for the con sponsorship action.

794
00:49:20,401 --> 00:49:21,689
Scott: So, I don't know.

795
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:23,500
Scott: It was nice to get stuff again at a con.

796
00:49:23,922 --> 00:49:28,400
Rym: Yeah, so hopefully for the next UberCon, we'd like to go back and actually run events at it.

797
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:32,699
Rym: I'll try to get in touch with the person who runs the gaming events to see if we can be GMs.

798
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,511
Scott: Yeah, I ordered some small press RPGs.

799
00:49:36,551 --> 00:49:39,580
Scott: I'll talk about those later in some future episodes.

800
00:49:39,961 --> 00:49:46,456
Scott: But I'm going to learn them, and hopefully there will be some awesome involving them at future UberCons or on this show.

801
00:49:46,776 --> 00:49:48,220
Scott: I'm going to definitely do awesome with them.

802
00:49:48,661 --> 00:49:54,892
Rym: Yep, and of course, once again, I apologize for the pacing and more importantly, the audio quality of tonight's episode.

803
00:49:55,273 --> 00:49:59,280
Rym: It will resume normal awesomeness as soon as we get our new compressor shipped there.

804
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,039
Scott: Yep, we're going to order it right now.

805
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:08,720
Rym: Yep, and stay tuned for the Luke Crane interview about Burning Wheel and metal, because it is quite metal.

806
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:10,289
Rym: Slurp!

807
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:20,199
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

808
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,790
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

816
00:50:50,362 --> 00:50:53,510
Scott: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
