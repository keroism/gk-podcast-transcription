1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:14,007
Rym: It's Thursday, November 13th, 2014.

2
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:14,457
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,921 --> 00:00:15,319
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,109
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:17,169 --> 00:00:18,980
Rym: Tonight, talking about apples.

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,979
Rym: Apple cake, apple pie, apple cobbler.

7
00:00:24,202 --> 00:00:25,218
Rym: Let's do this.

8
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:31,340
Rym: So something very interesting happened to me yesterday.

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,080
Rym: I was on the subway, well I was getting on the subway, so Grand Central.

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,073
Rym: I am walking from the 4/5 train.

11
00:00:38,202 --> 00:00:38,714
Scott: To the 7 train?

12
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:41,258
Rym: Down that long ramp that goes to the 7 train.

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,120
Scott: Was the guy playing his shamisen in there?

14
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,540
Rym: So there was no shamisen in there, there was no Casio guy wasn't there.

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,480
Rym: He's been there a lot lately.

16
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,079
Rym: There's no musicians there at all.

17
00:00:50,726 --> 00:00:51,760
Rym: And it wasn't super crowded.

18
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:52,330
Rym: Okay.

19
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,480
Rym: So for whatever reason.

20
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,927
Rym: So I'm walking down and I hear someone running behind me.

21
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:05,619
Rym: Now, New Yorker instinct kicks in because they're running way faster than even like...

22
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:07,420
Scott: Than trying to catch the subway running.

23
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:10,159
Rym: Yes, that is the running of shit's going down.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,639
Rym: So I turn to be ready for what's going on.

25
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:21,440
Rym: And I see either a kid or a very short person barreling toward me.

26
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,599
Rym: And they got there so quick they slammed into me.

27
00:01:25,482 --> 00:01:28,100
Rym: So I'm staggered back, but they were small.

28
00:01:28,362 --> 00:01:29,419
Rym: And you know, I'm not a huge guy.

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,899
Rym: Like I'm a little... I'm under six foot.

30
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:32,550
Rym: And I only weigh like 150 something pounds.

31
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,770
Rym: I'm not like this wall.

32
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:42,980
Rym: The kid or the guy bounced off of me backward and was stunned for about four or five seconds.

33
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,079
Rym: Then he got his wits together, shoved past me and ran on his way.

34
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:55,658
Rym: So in the time between when he slammed into me and was stunned and then he ran away, I had a decision to make.

35
00:01:56,345 --> 00:01:57,359
Rym: Do I stop him?

36
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,320
Scott: You don't know anything about why he's running.

37
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,139
Scott: Why would you stop him?

38
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,380
Rym: So here's what I did.

39
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,270
Scott: What if you stop him?

40
00:02:02,351 --> 00:02:03,238
Scott: and you know... Exactly.

41
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:03,588
Rym: Exactly.

42
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,711
Rym: That's the New Yorker assessment of.

43
00:02:05,912 --> 00:02:07,320
Rym: should I intervene in the situation?

44
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,999
Rym: And the answer is almost always no.

45
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:09,520
Scott: That's correct.

46
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:15,200
Rym: However, what I did is I look up to see, for example, is there anyone yelling?

47
00:02:15,942 --> 00:02:17,240
Rym: Is there anyone yelling in the distance?

48
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,018
Rym: My purse!

49
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:18,839
Rym: My purse!

50
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,160
Scott: Did he look like he was holding something?

51
00:02:20,884 --> 00:02:22,260
Rym: I couldn't have time to assess that.

52
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,859
Rym: Remember, I had about four seconds total before he started moving again.

53
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:30,476
Rym: And I really would have had to move quickly and decisively to actually stop him.

54
00:02:32,222 --> 00:02:35,860
Rym: So the other thing I look, is there a police officer in hot pursuit?

55
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,380
Scott: Let them take care of it.

56
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:37,920
Scott: It's not your problem.

57
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:39,757
Rym: If they're... So had I seen...

58
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,480
Scott: If you turn around and start running, the cops are going to chase you.

59
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,019
Scott: Don't do that.

60
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,256
Rym: Yeah.

61
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:53,460
Rym: So had I seen a police officer chasing him while he was still stunned in front of me, I may have knocked him over or something.

62
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:53,917
Rym: That's fun.

63
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:54,353
Rym: Yeah.

64
00:02:54,861 --> 00:02:59,460
Rym: But there was no one immediately chasing him and there was no further commotion online.

65
00:02:59,862 --> 00:03:02,337
Rym: So I decided, I don't know what he's running from.

66
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,860
Rym: He might be running from something that I would also run from.

67
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,720
Rym: I'm just not going to intervene.

68
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,577
Rym: So I let him run past me.

69
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,300
Rym: But I jogged along behind him a little bit to keep an eye on where he was going in case the situation progressed.

70
00:03:14,781 --> 00:03:15,860
Scott: Because you need to be involved.

71
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:16,939
Rym: Well, you never know.

72
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:18,340
Rym: Like, what if he like shot someone?

73
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:18,980
Rym: Like, you don't know.

74
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:21,740
Rym: So then another person...

75
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,779
Scott: Was that uncrowded there?

76
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:24,299
Rym: At that point, it was.

77
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:24,568
Scott: Wow.

78
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:25,920
Scott: That's super uncrowded.

79
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,040
Scott: When was it, like, three in the morning?

80
00:03:27,321 --> 00:03:30,940
Rym: So yesterday and Monday, there was just fucking no one on the subway.

81
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,536
Rym: I don't know why.

82
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,758
Rym: Like, it was really weird.

83
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:33,939
Rym: Like, really weird.

84
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,720
Rym: So then I hear footsteps and someone yelling, "Out of my way!

85
00:03:38,821 --> 00:03:39,109
Rym: Out of my

86
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,314
Rym: way!".

87
00:03:39,742 --> 00:03:42,120
Rym: And a huge motherfucker comes around the corner.

88
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,259
Scott: He's chasing the little motherfucker.

89
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,380
Rym: He is chasing the guy and he is shoving people out of the way and running.

90
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,560
Rym: And you know, it gets kind of wet.

91
00:03:50,161 --> 00:03:50,450
Scott: He's going...

92
00:03:50,942 --> 00:03:52,700
Rym: You know, it gets kind of wet along the left side.

93
00:03:52,742 --> 00:03:53,137
Rym: He fell down.

94
00:03:53,504 --> 00:03:54,700
Rym: He starts sliding.

95
00:03:55,941 --> 00:03:56,960
Rym: Slams into the wall.

96
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,618
Rym: And now he is dazed.

97
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,140
Rym: It's been about 30 seconds since the guy ran on at this point.

98
00:04:03,321 --> 00:04:04,200
Scott: He's not gonna catch him.

99
00:04:04,446 --> 00:04:04,660
Scott: It's over.

100
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:06,100
Rym: Well, so, yeah.

101
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,139
Rym: So then the guy's like, "Where'd he go?

102
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,620
Rym: Where'd he go?

103
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:08,928
Rym: Where'd he

104
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:09,073
Rym: go?".

105
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,800
Scott: There's only one way for him to go is a tunnel, dude.

106
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,378
Rym: Well, yeah.

107
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,419
Rym: But, like, you can go left or right down the stairs.

108
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:17,500
Rym: And you can also go around the corner and back up an escalator.

109
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:20,160
Rym: There's actually a lot of ways to go at that point.

110
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,800
Scott: Oh, you're right.

111
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,179
Scott: I thought you were, like, in the long part.

112
00:04:22,604 --> 00:04:23,919
Rym: So now I have decision number two.

113
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,300
Rym: Because there aren't that many people around.

114
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,400
Rym: And the few people around are pointedly trying to not be involved.

115
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:28,872
Scott: Yep.

116
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,000
Rym: So I have to decide, do I point or not?

117
00:04:32,461 --> 00:04:35,140
Rym: Is this person the good guy or the bad guy?

118
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,919
Scott: You have no idea.

119
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,959
Scott: If there isn't is a good guy or a bad guy.

120
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,599
Rym: He then immediately pulls out a badge.

121
00:04:41,202 --> 00:04:42,574
Rym: And he goes, "Undercover cop, where'd he

122
00:04:42,595 --> 00:04:42,716
Rym: go?".

123
00:04:43,624 --> 00:04:45,139
Rym: And it's a real badge, as far as I could tell.

124
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:45,589
Rym: Yeah.

125
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,860
Rym: So I point very detailedly without saying anything in case the dude's, like, right around the corner or something.

126
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,799
Rym: I don't want to get that involved.

127
00:04:54,021 --> 00:04:56,360
Rym: And then the cop takes off in that direction.

128
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,740
Rym: So I then go down, and I see the cop, like, walking up and down bristly.

129
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,680
Rym: Because there's a huge crowd down there by the subway.

130
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,479
Rym: Because it's been a while since this train came.

131
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,420
Rym: A train's about to leave going towards Grand-- toward Times Square.

132
00:05:11,002 --> 00:05:14,440
Rym: And another train's pulling in to about to let people on, going to Queens.

133
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:18,060
Rym: The train going to Times Square is obviously empty, because it's rush hour going home.

134
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,420
Rym: Like, no one goes that way in the evening.

135
00:05:20,104 --> 00:05:21,098
Scott: It's going to pick people up.

136
00:05:21,445 --> 00:05:22,017
Scott: Not drop them off.

137
00:05:22,464 --> 00:05:22,592
Rym: Yeah.

138
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:25,560
Rym: So he's going up and down, up and down, up and down.

139
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,700
Rym: And I look around just to see, like, do I see the motherfucker?

140
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,659
Rym: Because at that point, I'm going to point him out if I see him.

141
00:05:32,306 --> 00:05:32,878
Rym: I don't see him.

142
00:05:33,865 --> 00:05:34,740
Rym: I look around a little bit.

143
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,019
Rym: I just give up, and I just get on the subway.

144
00:05:36,445 --> 00:05:36,495
Rym: OK.

145
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,859
Rym: Then they try to close the--.

146
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,860
Scott: I wouldn't even put in that effort.

147
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,659
Scott: I would have been like, oh.

148
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:41,540
Rym: Maybe I'm Batman.

149
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:41,960
Rym: I don't know.

150
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,860
Scott: How do you know the undercover cop was even legit?

151
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,300
Rym: If he had a fake badge, then that is some mafia level--.

152
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,719
Scott: I actually read stories about people pretending to be undercover cops quite often.

153
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,780
Rym: They often don't actually have a real badge.

154
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:02,240
Scott: That's actually a frequent thing that I'll see, especially the police will tweet, like, so-and-so pretends to be a police officer.

155
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,300
Scott: Rob someone.

156
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,360
Rym: There's an episode of Friends about that, actually.

157
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:07,880
Scott: It's not uncommon.

158
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,060
Rym: So actually, I've gotten out of multiple speeding tickets when I was in high school by doing the following.

159
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:18,240
Rym: If an unmarked cop car turned on its rollers-- which in New York, they can't pull you over for speeding.

160
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:21,039
Rym: But in Michigan, they totally can.

161
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:31,599
Rym: Any time that happened to me, which usually was because I was speeding, I would basically calmly continue driving and make them follow me.

162
00:06:32,242 --> 00:06:35,100
Rym: And I drive straight to a police station and park.

163
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:42,119
Rym: And then when they start to try to read me the riot act of what the fuck you were doing, I didn't trust you were a real cop.

164
00:06:42,942 --> 00:06:45,719
Rym: I drove to the police station because that was the prudent thing to do.

165
00:06:46,302 --> 00:06:50,200
Rym: If you're a real cop, I'm waiting for-- show me a badge, that kind of thing.

166
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:55,620
Rym: And every time, that eventually turned into, I'm sorry from the cop.

167
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,100
Rym: And then I'm either forgetting why they pulled me over or not giving me a speeding ticket.

168
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:01,779
Rym: So pro tip for you kids.

169
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,479
Scott: So anyway-- How do you find the nearest police station?

170
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,297
Scott: Google Maps.

171
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:05,915
Rym: Yep.

172
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,252
Rym: Well, if your pro game is call 911, I guess.

173
00:07:09,902 --> 00:07:11,218
Rym: I'm not advocating you do that.

174
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:12,919
Rym: That's probably illegal.

175
00:07:13,928 --> 00:07:14,380
Rym: Just saying.

176
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:15,397
Scott: I'm being pulled over.

177
00:07:15,941 --> 00:07:16,599
Scott: What's the emergency?

178
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,019
Rym: I don't think they're a real cop.

179
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,012
Rym: What should I do?

180
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,395
Rym: You should pull over.

181
00:07:21,222 --> 00:07:21,616
Rym: Eh, maybe.

182
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:28,340
Rym: So anyway, so I get on the subway and then stand clear of the closing doors.

183
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,840
Rym: And then the doors go ch-ch-ch-ch-chunk and then open.

184
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:32,899
Rym: Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chunk and then open.

185
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:35,580
Rym: Followed by, please stand clear.

186
00:07:35,863 --> 00:07:37,280
Rym: At this point, it's not the recording.

187
00:07:37,442 --> 00:07:39,039
Rym: It's the conductor getting increasingly pissed.

188
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,139
Scott: Who's holding the doors open?

189
00:07:40,643 --> 00:07:41,079
Rym: The cop.

190
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:41,818
Scott: All right.

191
00:07:42,523 --> 00:07:43,699
Scott: He's checking the whole train?

192
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,899
Rym: No, there's only one cop.

193
00:07:45,121 --> 00:07:47,820
Rym: So he's holding the door open so the car, so the train can't leave.

194
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,200
Scott: Why didn't you just tell the guy not to make the train leave?

195
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,460
Rym: Because he's not near the guy and the guy's about to leave.

196
00:07:54,142 --> 00:07:55,620
Rym: So this goes on for a while.

197
00:07:56,301 --> 00:08:01,800
Rym: And then, like people on my truck, my car getting increasingly, increasingly agitated.

198
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:02,357
Rym: Of course.

199
00:08:02,663 --> 00:08:02,920
Rym: Of course.

200
00:08:03,781 --> 00:08:09,740
Rym: And then I see 10 or 15 cops, not just normal cops.

201
00:08:10,002 --> 00:08:11,319
Rym: There were multiple sergeants.

202
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,107
Scott: So it was a real cop.

203
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,100
Rym: At least one captain, an event coordinator.

204
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,817
Rym: You know, they were like, it was basically at least 14 cops.

205
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,820
Scott: Shouldn't this be like on Twitter?

206
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,320
Scott: Like the police Twitter, like apprehended so-and-so?

207
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:24,859
Rym: I don't know.

208
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,038
Rym: So, so yeah, now at this point I'm like, man, maybe I should have knocked that guy over, but there's no way I could have known back then.

209
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:35,559
Rym: So eventually the conductor, the doors close and stay closed.

210
00:08:36,241 --> 00:08:40,299
Rym: The other train, which hasn't moved yet, the doors close and it sits there.

211
00:08:41,203 --> 00:08:45,799
Rym: Then I see cops sweep the other train and push everyone out of it, like down the end and out of door.

212
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,339
Rym: And then the train leaves empty.

213
00:08:49,383 --> 00:08:55,439
Rym: Then the conductor gets on the train and on the announcement and says, the police are holding us in the station.

214
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,458
Rym: Please stand by.

215
00:08:57,506 --> 00:08:58,400
Rym: So we're locked on the train.

216
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:58,898
Rym: We're trapped.

217
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,580
Rym: Then almost immediately conductor says, the police are not holding us here.

218
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:11,819
Rym: The trains dispatcher is holding us here due to train traffic ahead of us.

219
00:09:12,382 --> 00:09:13,918
Rym: You will move along shortly.

220
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:15,549
Scott: Sure.

221
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:16,760
Rym: Yeah, sure dude.

222
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,099
Scott: Way to go MTA guy.

223
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,959
Rym: So then cops are canvassing and there's a crowd.

224
00:09:21,325 --> 00:09:22,160
Scott: MTA too real.

225
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:22,609
Rym: Yeah.

226
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:29,040
Rym: Well, because if the police were holding it, I think that's technically illegal detention of like 2000 people.

227
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:30,387
Rym: Yeah.

228
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,860
Rym: So then police are sweeping the platform, tons of cops.

229
00:09:35,422 --> 00:09:39,260
Rym: And cops come through our car and guys still on the train.

230
00:09:39,701 --> 00:09:40,059
Rym: I don't know.

231
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,139
Rym: So cops come through our car in both directions.

232
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,419
Rym: So when the first cops come through the car, I'm like, you're looking for that really short guy.

233
00:09:47,743 --> 00:09:49,100
Rym: And they're like, no comment, no comment.

234
00:09:49,782 --> 00:09:56,800
Rym: And I was like, well, if you're looking for him, if he was smart, he probably just ran back up that other stairway instead of staying on the platform.

235
00:09:57,522 --> 00:10:00,219
Rym: And then they're like, no comment, but thanks.

236
00:10:01,523 --> 00:10:03,600
Rym: And then we sit there for like another 10 fucking minutes.

237
00:10:03,861 --> 00:10:08,880
Rym: And then eventually the train just goes on and I couldn't find out what happened.

238
00:10:10,021 --> 00:10:11,560
Scott: They probably got away cause he was tiny.

239
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,699
Scott: Maybe he went in the subway tunnel.

240
00:10:13,701 --> 00:10:18,360
Rym: But whatever that short guy did, that was an unusual response by the cops.

241
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,699
Rym: So I suspect it was one of those like had a weapon was about to be frisked.

242
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,520
Rym: weirdo situations and not just normal situation.

243
00:10:27,465 --> 00:10:28,480
Rym: That is my story.

244
00:10:28,723 --> 00:10:29,899
Rym: And it has an anticlimax.

245
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:31,720
Scott: My story is less exciting.

246
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,679
Scott: It involves the vastly superior to police fire department.

247
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:38,640
Rym: Ooh, you know, that was the advice that apparently my grandpa gave to my dad.

248
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,080
Rym: When my dad was like, I want to be fired.

249
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:40,797
Rym: I want to be a cop.

250
00:10:41,222 --> 00:10:43,479
Rym: And he was like, you know, I'm a fireman.

251
00:10:44,163 --> 00:10:45,038
Rym: My dad's a fireman.

252
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:47,439
Rym: So, uh, you know, lots of firemen.

253
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:49,780
Rym: You also know lots of police cause we're all friends.

254
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:53,700
Rym: How many of the police officers are happy with their lives?

255
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,459
Rym: How many of the firemen are happy with their lives?

256
00:10:57,302 --> 00:10:58,359
Rym: And then my dad became a fireman.

257
00:10:59,063 --> 00:10:59,919
Rym: The tail I was told.

258
00:11:00,781 --> 00:11:06,319
Scott: So we're looking out the window at our office and there's a, there's a, there's building across the street from us.

259
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,818
Scott: There's two big ass billboards on it.

260
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,020
Scott: They usually advertise the same thing together.

261
00:11:10,602 --> 00:11:17,799
Scott: And lately they've been putting up these ones to advertise a movie coming soon with a little tiny screen that says how many days until the movie comes out.

262
00:11:18,403 --> 00:11:20,019
Scott: So that interstellar movies up there now.

263
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:20,434
Rym: Oh yeah.

264
00:11:21,161 --> 00:11:25,959
Scott: And I don't want to see that, but the little screen on it was like, you know, it got to zero cause it's out.

265
00:11:26,563 --> 00:11:29,840
Scott: And then it said, instead of saying out now, it says out.

266
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,227
Scott: Wow.

267
00:11:31,385 --> 00:11:32,517
Scott: And it was really strange.

268
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:37,120
Scott: But then today my coworker was like, Hey, check it out outside.

269
00:11:37,601 --> 00:11:51,539
Scott: And this little tiny like, you know, mini screen, all that basically just says a number on it as a two fire trucks and a guys up on a ladder next to the screen, like blasting it with fire extinguisher.

270
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:51,913
Scott: Right.

271
00:11:54,242 --> 00:12:01,000
Scott: And they like closed off the sidewalk underneath it because I guess the, the rain plus electricity must've set that shitty screen on fire.

272
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:01,918
Rym: That's really funny.

273
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,639
Scott: So screen set on fire.

274
00:12:04,651 --> 00:12:04,859
Rym: All right.

275
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,020
Rym: So in my news, not that exciting cause it's, you know, it's the lounge.

276
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,060
Rym: We can talk about whatever those antique nights.

277
00:12:10,221 --> 00:12:11,239
Rym: I don't have any real news.

278
00:12:11,581 --> 00:12:13,100
Rym: Well, there's lots of real news, just nothing.

279
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,378
Rym: I have anything new to say about.

280
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,180
Rym: So, uh, I saw something else involving firemen at my office.

281
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:27,140
Rym: Cause you know, I work right next to the, uh, well, so a lot of people I know who work downtown call it the nine 11 tower or the freedom tower.

282
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,520
Scott: It's one world trade center.

283
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,839
Scott: You're not allowed to call it anything else.

284
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,680
Rym: Almost no one I know calls it that except you and Emily.

285
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,360
Scott: You're not allowed to call it anything else except one world trade center.

286
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,140
Scott: That's what it's named.

287
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,657
Rym: Most of my coworkers and the people I know call it the nine 11 tower.

288
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,479
Scott: Well, they're dumbasses.

289
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,700
Scott: So it's technically like number one, world trade center.

290
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,278
Scott: Cause number one is the address, right?

291
00:12:48,461 --> 00:12:52,833
Rym: Uh, by that logic, you can't call the Lincoln building, the Lincoln building or you or 60 East 42nd.

292
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,819
Rym: You have to call it one grand central place.

293
00:12:56,204 --> 00:12:56,300
Scott: Sure.

294
00:12:57,122 --> 00:13:00,320
Scott: Uh, the something that's interesting is it's not open yet.

295
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:08,718
Scott: We won't be open until next year, but the observatory at the top that's probably gonna cost a million dollars and have a long wait to go to is called one world observatory.

296
00:13:09,662 --> 00:13:10,578
Rym: Ha ha ha.

297
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:11,337
Rym: Clever girl.

298
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,960
Scott: O N E world.

299
00:13:15,721 --> 00:13:19,240
Rym: That's, that's, that's clever in that way that I wish people would be less clever.

300
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:19,858
Scott: Yes.

301
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:25,920
Rym: So I work right next to that thing and suddenly there's some commotion.

302
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:32,180
Rym: And a scaffold is hanging by one set of cables instead of the usual two set of cables.

303
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,800
Scott: The kind that is used for cleaning windows.

304
00:13:34,062 --> 00:13:34,130
Rym: Yes.

305
00:13:34,461 --> 00:13:37,516
Rym: And there's three dudes strapped into this thing like 700 feet up track.

306
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:45,079
Scott: That's why even though you're in one of those things and it seems pretty stable, you still strap yourself to it with some, you know, tethers.

307
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,460
Rym: So of course I'm the only one who notices or knows this.

308
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,120
Rym: So I go to Twitter and sure enough, like everyone knows it's easy.

309
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:52,677
Rym: No, no.

310
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,059
Rym: Almost no one has talked about it yet.

311
00:13:55,461 --> 00:13:57,460
Rym: So I'm going to, I'm going to be like, oh, I should tweet about this.

312
00:13:57,741 --> 00:14:00,880
Rym: And then I search for like, I searched for scaffold and I see the tweets coming in.

313
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,419
Rym: Like, okay.

314
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,780
Rym: And then I look at the live camera and I'm like, okay, they didn't fall.

315
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:05,539
Rym: This, I don't have this.

316
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,660
Rym: I don't have to feel super sad.

317
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,799
Scott: They attached themselves to it like they're supposed to.

318
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,920
Rym: They're basically just hanging out there.

319
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:16,519
Scott: I mean, if you're in a building that tall, you're, even though if you're a pro at window cleaning on tall buildings, you are fucking strapping yourself in.

320
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:17,180
Rym: Yeah.

321
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:17,518
Rym: Granted.

322
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,020
Rym: Uh, so I'm my building, right?

323
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,186
Rym: I'm like 180 feet up.

324
00:14:22,844 --> 00:14:23,119
Rym: Okay.

325
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,851
Scott: So, you know, high enough to kill like 180 stories.

326
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:26,336
Scott: Yeah.

327
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,879
Scott: I don't know how big it actually is.

328
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,860
Rym: I think they were the, they were between the 60th and the 70th story.

329
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,659
Rym: I heard that's high.

330
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:32,734
Scott: That's more than 180 feet.

331
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,619
Rym: That's because I'm on the 16th floor.

332
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:42,584
Rym: So in my building, I have seen the people who clean our windows and they have no safety equipment.

333
00:14:42,826 --> 00:14:44,599
Rym: and what they do is they open the window.

334
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,018
Rym: They grab like the wall.

335
00:14:46,342 --> 00:14:48,719
Rym: They kind of hang out the window and just squeegee it.

336
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:50,380
Scott: So that's cool.

337
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:58,440
Scott: But the way you're supposed to do it, it's about an old buildings is hooks outside the window and you wear a little harness and you hook yourself to the side of the building.

338
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:58,700
Rym: Yeah.

339
00:14:58,781 --> 00:15:00,560
Rym: I use a similar harness when I go rock climbing.

340
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:00,897
Rym: Right.

341
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,200
Scott: And then you unhook and come back inside.

342
00:15:03,581 --> 00:15:07,699
Rym: So anyway, the scaffolds hang in there and like, you know, I'm the internet person in the office, so I know.

343
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,320
Rym: So I'm like, guys, look out the window and then look on Twitter.

344
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:11,955
Scott: Yep.

345
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:14,780
Rym: And of course the guys just waiting and it was all fine.

346
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,507
Rym: So then the big debate that I was having with everyone is the method of getting them down.

347
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:20,100
Rym: How are they going to be rescued?

348
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:21,619
Rym: And my guess was correct.

349
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,818
Rym: My guess was they're going to cut the glass on the inside, like right where they're hanging and just let them in.

350
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,578
Rym: And sure enough, they did.

351
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:39,360
Rym: The photo of that is really interesting because the layer that's actually outside, like the outside layer peeled away like a banana, basically.

352
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,318
Scott: Well, it's laminated.

353
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,180
Scott: Yeah, right.

354
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:41,428
Scott: So.

355
00:15:41,801 --> 00:15:43,560
Rym: So I suspect that's not actually.

356
00:15:43,662 --> 00:15:44,839
Rym: It's not just glass.

357
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,040
Rym: I suspect they cut the tempered or whatever glass out first.

358
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,960
Rym: And then on the outside surface, there's also a thin film.

359
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,320
Scott: The thing I understand is why they just remove the panel completely.

360
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:54,552
Scott: Right.

361
00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:00,780
Scott: I mean, those panels are attached somehow when they're setting, when you're installing them, you could probably just they're like glued around the edge or something.

362
00:16:00,981 --> 00:16:01,779
Scott: You just unglue it.

363
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,600
Rym: I suspect that would have taken a lot longer.

364
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:04,809
Scott: I don't know.

365
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,279
Scott: You know, Harry?

366
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:07,400
Rym: Yeah.

367
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,296
Scott: They're just hanging out.

368
00:16:08,782 --> 00:16:09,660
Rym: Can't hang out that long.

369
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:13,000
Rym: And they had to get the guys out before they could secure the scaffold.

370
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,320
Rym: Another fear was that it was going to fall completely.

371
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,940
Rym: So that is how they save people in that situation.

372
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,460
Rym: They just cut a hole in the side of the building.

373
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,458
Rym: I'm sure they have all glass.

374
00:16:23,962 --> 00:16:24,880
Rym: So now, you know.

375
00:16:26,221 --> 00:16:26,306
Scott: Yeah.

376
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,246
Rym: Okay.

377
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:27,914
Rym: That's it.

378
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,759
Scott: All right.

379
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:34,120
Rym: So I heard nothing but outside my window for like four hours.

380
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,979
Scott: I would have just gone home.

381
00:16:35,348 --> 00:16:35,496
Scott: Yeah.

382
00:16:36,482 --> 00:16:38,419
Rym: And we had the window open because it's fucking hot that day too.

383
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,995
Scott: So there's been this battle going on.

384
00:16:40,961 --> 00:16:42,159
Scott: Completely change of topic.

385
00:16:42,982 --> 00:16:44,580
Rym: It's been nothing but New York so far.

386
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,340
Rym: Is this not New York?

387
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:45,918
Scott: It's not New York.

388
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,189
Rym: Wow.

389
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,720
Scott: So Amazon has been fighting with that book publisher.

390
00:16:48,982 --> 00:16:49,180
Scott: Oh yeah.

391
00:16:49,822 --> 00:16:50,055
Rym: Hachette.

392
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:50,556
Rym: Hachette.

393
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:51,159
Rym: Hachette.

394
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,438
Scott: Whatever.

395
00:16:51,722 --> 00:16:52,019
Scott: Hachette.

396
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,600
Scott: I think it's correct.

397
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:52,832
Scott: Whatever.

398
00:16:55,722 --> 00:17:02,199
Scott: And you know, a lot of people that I tend to agree with on a lot of things take Hachette's side in this battle.

399
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:09,980
Scott: And the reason for that is understandable is that look, you basically this big company Amazon has a monopoly and is sort of imposing their will.

400
00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:11,819
Scott: And it's like, yeah, that's not right.

401
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:14,419
Scott: We shouldn't have a company with a monopoly imposing their will.

402
00:17:15,163 --> 00:17:17,040
Scott: So it's sort of like Comcast imposes their will.

403
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:17,699
Scott: That's not cool.

404
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:19,479
Scott: So why is it cool if Amazon does it?

405
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:21,920
Scott: And it's not cool in principle, right?

406
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:32,840
Scott: However, in this situation, what Amazon's basically saying is, is Hachette, look, you're charging like more than 10 bucks for one stink in an ebook.

407
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:34,159
Scott: What the fuck?

408
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:41,318
Scott: For 10 bucks a month, someone can get Netflix or Spotify, which is every music or every movie ever.

409
00:17:41,782 --> 00:17:43,591
Scott: And you're looking for one as book.

410
00:17:44,536 --> 00:17:45,220
Scott: that much money.

411
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:46,679
Rym: I don't read that many as books.

412
00:17:46,861 --> 00:17:48,900
Scott: I'm just saying one stinking book.

413
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,879
Scott: You're charging that much.

414
00:17:50,063 --> 00:17:50,559
Rym: I only had one.

415
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:55,945
Scott: You should be charging 10 bucks for subscription to every Hachette book ever written, ever published.

416
00:17:56,529 --> 00:17:58,140
Scott: free, unlimited access a month.

417
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,019
Scott: That's what you should be doing.

418
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:04,017
Rym: I only ever had one stinking book and that was that copy of the Prince of Nothing that smelled like locks for whatever reason.

419
00:18:04,641 --> 00:18:07,220
Scott: You remember that fire beware used on Amazon.

420
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:16,540
Rym: And two, obviously there is a you know, there is a big issue with just in general, like how to pay for the creation of media like Spotify and all the right for the consumer.

421
00:18:17,322 --> 00:18:18,539
Rym: Great for the big bands.

422
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,500
Rym: Little bands basically are completely fucked by that.

423
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,600
Rym: But that like that's that is a debate that society has to have.

424
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:31,180
Scott: The point is that the pricing, if you're just you know, the way they're selling the books is you buy one book, you get an e-book.

425
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:32,960
Scott: The pricing is ridiculous.

426
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,240
Scott: So Amazon was like, look, we can't make any fucking money with your pricing.

427
00:18:36,722 --> 00:18:46,540
Scott: So we are going to use our power as the source of most of your revenue, as your top reseller to sort of push you and make you give us, you know, legit e-book prices.

428
00:18:47,382 --> 00:18:49,280
Scott: And Hachette was like, fuck you, we're going to fight.

429
00:18:49,584 --> 00:18:50,099
Scott: So they fought.

430
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:58,240
Scott: Well, they settled and there were absolutely no pretty much no details released about the agreement whatsoever.

431
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:10,696
Rym: What I find interesting is that basically of everyone I know in the world that I know, like actually know this person in some fashion, maybe three people knew this was happening or gave a shit.

432
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,475
Rym: Yeah, which was very illuminating.

433
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,380
Rym: as to these kinds of issues.

434
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:19,378
Rym: On one hand, I tend to root for the small company because the big companies tend to fuck us over.

435
00:19:19,681 --> 00:19:24,059
Rym: But on the other hand, I also root for whoever works the best for me.

436
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:24,720
Scott: Right.

437
00:19:25,204 --> 00:19:26,480
Rym: See, I'm the Lorax.

438
00:19:26,943 --> 00:19:27,580
Rym: This is the consumer.

439
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,680
Scott: This is the difference is that in the Comcast case, Comcast is fucking over the consumer.

440
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:35,600
Scott: Amazon is basically fighting for the consumer with their value.

441
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,580
Rym: Well, here's a better example.

442
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,960
Scott: Oh, against the big evil book publisher.

443
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,140
Scott: And why were people sympathizing with a book publisher?

444
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,580
Rym: Here's a better example.

445
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,240
Rym: Visa is an awful evil company.

446
00:19:45,562 --> 00:19:45,780
Scott: Oh, yeah.

447
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,600
Rym: Visa, however, fucks other people for my benefit.

448
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,880
Scott: Yeah, they fuck over small business.

449
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,140
Scott: They don't fuck over people who buy things with credit cards.

450
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,239
Rym: In fact, they bend over backward to help us.

451
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:56,799
Scott: That's right.

452
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:00,379
Rym: So thus the conundrum of two parts of me.

453
00:20:01,162 --> 00:20:07,038
Rym: One part of me roots for Visa because they fight for me, and the other part of me wants to knock that Lorax on his ass.

454
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:16,500
Scott: But yeah, I guess they resolved whatever their problem was somehow, but they didn't release any details of what the solution was.

455
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,035
Rym: That's a nice ebook business.

456
00:20:18,055 --> 00:20:18,480
Rym: you got there.

457
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,635
Rym: Be a shame if something were to happen to happen to it.

458
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:30,900
Rym: So things of the day, Scott had a problem.

459
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:36,675
Rym: Scott had two really good things of the day, so he asked me to arbitrate which one he should use.

460
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,979
Scott: Well, I mean, people have told us that my things of the day are awesome and Rims is not as awesome.

461
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,280
Rym: Depends on the person in the area.

462
00:20:43,421 --> 00:20:47,240
Scott: If we redo the website, we should implement some sort of thing of the day voting thing.

463
00:20:47,543 --> 00:20:47,979
Rym: We should.

464
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:49,580
Rym: We totally should.

465
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,399
Scott: See who gets the better things of the day.

466
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,599
Rym: We totally should.

467
00:20:53,100 --> 00:21:00,480
Rym: However, sadly, we can't do a historical analysis because most of our things of the day have been taken off the internet.

468
00:21:00,864 --> 00:21:02,159
Scott: I can figure that out as well.

469
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,920
Rym: Yeah, but the problem is what if like more of your things than mine were taken off the internet than if we did a modern analysis of voting?

470
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,520
Scott: Anyway, my things they are better.

471
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,459
Scott: So it's going to use two Scott things of the day and zero Rym things of the day.

472
00:21:13,801 --> 00:21:21,120
Rym: Well, my problem was as the arbiter that Scott asked to bring in, you know, like the like the arbitration of Scotland or before the wars for independence.

473
00:21:22,543 --> 00:21:23,977
Rym: I like both of Scott's things a lot.

474
00:21:24,962 --> 00:21:28,040
Rym: And while I had some things of the day, they suck compared to mine.

475
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,299
Scott: Even you're admitting that they're not good.

476
00:21:30,745 --> 00:21:31,600
Rym: It's not that they weren't good.

477
00:21:32,782 --> 00:21:38,100
Rym: It's that I kind of want to save them for when they're relevant to the they're just weird internet shit like what you've been finding.

478
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,500
Rym: Only one of them is weird internet.

479
00:21:41,421 --> 00:21:50,320
Scott: Anyway, so one thing that always bothers me is that when you go in the subway, New York again, there's music performers in the subway and sometimes they're good.

480
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,980
Scott: The best subway music station that you can go to is Metropolitan G train platform.

481
00:21:55,805 --> 00:21:56,378
Scott: That's the best.

482
00:21:56,661 --> 00:22:05,540
Scott: But anyway, most often other in places other than Metropolitan Avenue, Brooklyn G train platform, you only have a few genres of subway music.

483
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,379
Rym: There's pan flute guys.

484
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,234
Scott: Pan flute guy.

485
00:22:09,601 --> 00:22:14,660
Rym: There's there's hobo who found a Casio keyboard music student from Juilliard practicing.

486
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,440
Rym: Yeah, bagpipes.

487
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,499
Rym: Pretty common, actually.

488
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,759
Scott: Generic guitar, dude.

489
00:22:19,301 --> 00:22:20,479
Scott: There's a few genres.

490
00:22:20,902 --> 00:22:21,559
Rym: Oh, shitty drummer.

491
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,539
Rym: Shitty drummer is very common, right?

492
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:24,097
Scott: Is it?

493
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,219
Scott: There are quite a few genres.

494
00:22:25,501 --> 00:22:29,479
Scott: It's not like you're really limited, but there's plenty of genres you never see.

495
00:22:30,273 --> 00:22:30,460
Scott: Right.

496
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,300
Scott: I never see like high quality dancing.

497
00:22:34,334 --> 00:22:34,500
Scott: Right.

498
00:22:34,661 --> 00:22:36,139
Scott: You only see Showtime dancing.

499
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,439
Rym: You know, I'm step back, step back.

500
00:22:38,788 --> 00:22:38,980
Scott: Right.

501
00:22:39,621 --> 00:22:41,800
Scott: I never see metal band in the subway.

502
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:43,039
Scott: It just don't happen.

503
00:22:43,573 --> 00:22:43,760
Scott: Right.

504
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:47,000
Scott: You don't see like opera singer in the subway.

505
00:22:47,665 --> 00:22:48,639
Rym: I've seen that a couple of times.

506
00:22:48,781 --> 00:22:50,580
Scott: I've never seen it, but it's rare.

507
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,279
Rym: Actually, you know where I sell that the most?

508
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:55,180
Rym: In Grand Central for Metro North.

509
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,039
Scott: You never see Klezmer in the subway, even in Jutown.

510
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,539
Scott: It just doesn't happen.

511
00:23:00,121 --> 00:23:04,400
Scott: So another thing, a metal is the one I most want to see in the subway because it would just echo down the tunnels.

512
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:04,920
Scott: Oh, my God.

513
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:11,840
Scott: But anyway, so one thing you also don't often see in the subway is electronic dance music.

514
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,720
Scott: Well, here's two dudes wearing Luchador masks.

515
00:23:16,081 --> 00:23:18,420
Rym: They've definitely got a Daft Punk attempt vibe.

516
00:23:18,922 --> 00:23:23,040
Scott: And they are playing electronic dance music in the subway station.

517
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:23,776
Scott: Oh, yeah.

518
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,360
Scott: So awesome.

519
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,079
Rym: Pretty awesome.

520
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:25,728
Scott: Okay.

521
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,739
Scott: Thing of the day number two, the hero.

522
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:28,292
Scott: Right.

523
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:36,718
Scott: So you'll remember my thing of the day from the previous episode of GeekNights involved a guy getting out of his car, looking at a dude who is tailgating him.

524
00:23:38,522 --> 00:23:38,773
Scott: Metasingly.

525
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:39,835
Rym: Spoilers.

526
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,499
Scott: Getting back in his car and driving off.

527
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:50,080
Scott: So here is a music video by a dude named like Im Jang Chung.

528
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:51,319
Scott: I think is his name.

529
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,680
Scott: I'm pretty sure it's hard to read other languages.

530
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,740
Scott: I have to rely on Google to help me out here.

531
00:23:58,181 --> 00:24:03,939
Scott: He's an actor and a musician and, you know, many other things.

532
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:04,856
Scott: Right.

533
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,160
Scott: He's a talented individual.

534
00:24:07,241 --> 00:24:08,239
Scott: So he made this music video.

535
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,554
Scott: It came out last year, late last year, like 2013 something.

536
00:24:12,881 --> 00:24:15,458
Scott: And this music video has a story to it.

537
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:20,180
Scott: The song is called Open the Door, but and the story of the music video.

538
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,980
Scott: I mean, I can't understand the lyrics of the song.

539
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,659
Scott: It should probably be funny and make a lot of sense.

540
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:31,960
Scott: But if you just watch the music video, the story is internationally accessible and breaks through all language barriers.

541
00:24:32,801 --> 00:24:38,554
Scott: And it is pretty much exactly like my thing of the day from one episode of GeekNights Ago.

542
00:24:40,383 --> 00:24:41,515
Scott: So and it's a good song, too.

543
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:42,295
Scott: Yeah.

544
00:24:42,942 --> 00:24:44,259
Scott: And the dance is kind of easy.

545
00:24:44,641 --> 00:24:50,178
Rym: That the motion that he makes, I'm going to make at appropriate moments in social interactions from this point on.

546
00:24:50,724 --> 00:24:51,899
Scott: How often is that going to happen?

547
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,578
Scott: Pretty rarely.

548
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,840
Scott: But how often are you near people who need to be stared at quietly?

549
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,280
Rym: Well, depends.

550
00:24:57,481 --> 00:24:58,540
Rym: I'm in the New York subway.

551
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,360
Scott: Maybe your coworkers.

552
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,200
Rym: No, it's got to be like at a convention.

553
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:05,240
Rym: Maybe that'll be the universal signal for that guy, that guy.

554
00:25:05,662 --> 00:25:06,074
Rym: And I don't know.

555
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,058
Rym: Figure it out.

556
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:07,589
Rym: Play it by ear.

557
00:25:08,201 --> 00:25:10,400
Scott: Maybe we should do that at conventions if someone's misbehaving.

558
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:22,918
Scott: Instead of like instead of trying to figure out like what to say to someone who's like if they said something racist or sexist, just stare down, just walk up to them and just stand there looking at them menacingly.

559
00:25:23,827 --> 00:25:24,057
Rym: Huh.

560
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:31,800
Rym: The problem is those people don't take even normal social cues like they bounce off of.

561
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,159
Rym: It's like trying to pour oil on a duck like it just doesn't work.

562
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,040
Scott: Well, we should try it anyway.

563
00:25:38,464 --> 00:25:39,740
Rym: I don't think we should pour oil on a duck.

564
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,180
Scott: No, we should just stare at people menacing.

565
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,660
Rym: So yeah, the Book Club book is Watership Down by Richard Adams.

566
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,240
Scott: We should read Fire Ship Up.

567
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,439
Rym: Okay.

568
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,320
Scott: Just to do the sequel.

569
00:25:54,326 --> 00:25:55,139
Rym: So it's a book.

570
00:25:55,841 --> 00:25:56,420
Rym: Semi-famous.

571
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,116
Rym: Pretty good.

572
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,939
Rym: I just got to the Cultist Rabbits.

573
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,159
Rym: And there's some Cultist Rabbits.

574
00:26:03,441 --> 00:26:07,540
Rym: The history, the story of how and why this book was written is also pretty interesting.

575
00:26:08,242 --> 00:26:09,920
Rym: Inspired a lot of things down the road.

576
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:16,699
Rym: And one of the things you'll notice after you read it is that people are referencing this book way more often than you realize.

577
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:18,933
Rym: Yeah.

578
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,199
Rym: The Metamoment in general.

579
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,100
Scott: PAX East tickets went on sale.

580
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,619
Rym: There are a couple of Sunday badges left.

581
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,679
Scott: Are there any Fridays left?

582
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,160
Rym: There were as of four hours ago.

583
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,295
Rym: I don't know if there still are.

584
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,718
Scott: Let's go to east.paxsite.com.

585
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,420
Rym: It's faster just to type.

586
00:26:34,681 --> 00:26:37,200
Scott: We're definitely going to be there enforcing.

587
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,440
Rym: There are still Friday badges.

588
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:38,980
Scott: Yeah.

589
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,660
Rym: We will be there no matter what.

590
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,079
Rym: We will at least be enforcing.

591
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,939
Scott: We don't know if we're going to have panels accepted.

592
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,320
Rym: I mean, I hope we will, but I've learned to never assume anything.

593
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,240
Scott: So far, they've always been accepted, but there's no guarantees.

594
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,027
Rym: We have presented at every single PAX, including Australia, since 2008.

595
00:26:55,027 --> 00:26:55,260
Scott: Right.

596
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,800
Rym: So I'm going to be really sad the day that that streak is broken by us or them.

597
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,232
Scott: Right.

598
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:04,820
Scott: Either way, uh, PAX South also hopefully getting our panels accepted.

599
00:27:05,245 --> 00:27:05,458
Rym: Yep.

600
00:27:06,142 --> 00:27:13,540
Rym: If they accept our panels, we'll be doing one or both of learning games and bad games.

601
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,175
Scott: All right.

602
00:27:16,521 --> 00:27:16,899
Scott: Magfest.

603
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:22,740
Scott: If somehow we end up not going to PAX South, Rym can cancel his hotel room and we can go to Magfest instead.

604
00:27:23,281 --> 00:27:30,160
Rym: If you aren't going to PAX South because you fucked up and didn't get badges, you should go to Magfest instead.

605
00:27:30,581 --> 00:27:31,500
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

606
00:27:31,822 --> 00:27:34,980
Rym: Magfest is my second or third favorite gaming con.

607
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:36,980
Scott: Other meta things.

608
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:42,740
Scott: Just want to remind people of the vast number of ways in which you can interact with us on the internet.

609
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,480
Scott: We have a Twitter account, GeekNights.

610
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,740
Scott: We have personal Twitter accounts.

611
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,759
Scott: You can find those on your own.

612
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,320
Rym: We both have YouTube accounts.

613
00:27:48,561 --> 00:27:49,800
Rym: I have all our panels and lectures.

614
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,158
Rym: Scott has everything Netrunner.

615
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,039
Scott: We have Facebook page.

616
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:54,813
Scott: We have a Google+ page.

617
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:02,338
Scott: We have a newsletter that you can subscribe to by going to our website and somewhere in the footer is like a newsletter link.

618
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,060
Scott: We have a website, frontrecruit.com.

00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,673
Scott: We have a forum on the website where you can discuss things with other people who listen to the show.

620
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:14,160
Scott: We have a new Facebook rooms thing.

621
00:28:14,581 --> 00:28:16,269
Rym: We have 988 episodes of GeekNights.

622
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,340
Rym: Every one of them is online and you can listen to all of them for free on our website.

623
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:24,616
Rym: All of them.

624
00:28:25,261 --> 00:28:32,360
Rym: Also, we've done 170 panels over the years and about 30 of them are on YouTube.

625
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,638
Rym: You can just watch them.

626
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,199
Scott: We have an IRC channel.

627
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:40,155
Scott: That's IRC.foodnetic.net.

628
00:28:40,216 --> 00:28:40,960
Scott: pound GeekNights.

629
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,960
Rym: I was hanging out there a whole bunch until my computer died at work and I'm waiting for my new computer to come.

630
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,200
Scott: You don't have any computer at work whatsoever?

631
00:28:47,341 --> 00:28:49,439
Rym: I do, but I didn't restart idling.

632
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:54,455
Scott: So, I mean, there's tons of stuff that we places.

633
00:28:54,475 --> 00:28:56,980
Scott: you can find us and interact with us via Internet.

634
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,259
Scott: Pick whichever one is your favorite and do it.

635
00:29:01,943 --> 00:29:04,260
Rym: All right, so apples.

636
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:05,958
Rym: Apples.

637
00:29:06,485 --> 00:29:07,380
Rym: You know what I just remembered?

638
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,636
Rym: Remember that fucked up My Little Pony, like the weird animated one that was all creepy and weird?

639
00:29:14,021 --> 00:29:17,019
Scott: Yeah, so the one that was like something something that.

640
00:29:17,301 --> 00:29:20,360
Rym: Yeah, that moved JPEG Applejack eating too many apples.

641
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,099
Rym: Yeah, I'm suddenly reminded of that.

642
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,640
Rym: That's what this episode is about, right?

643
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,920
Scott: So basically, uh, GeekNights is pretty seasonal.

644
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:32,136
Scott: We got convention season, game season, anime season, apple season, a lot of seasons, rabbit season.

645
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,300
Scott: Apple season is just about over here in the Northeast US, right?

646
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,440
Scott: They tend to come out in the October, November area.

647
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,920
Scott: The Apple House is open.

648
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,060
Scott: I bought a two big sacks of apples yesterday.

649
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:49,272
Rym: The Northeast is one of the parts of America and the northern Midwest where people pay attention to apples like.

650
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:50,840
Scott: we grow a lot of varieties.

651
00:29:51,201 --> 00:29:52,080
Rym: Yeah, like apples are everywhere.

652
00:29:52,241 --> 00:30:00,140
Rym: But in a lot of the country, like if you ask someone what kind of apple they like, they're probably going to say red, yellow or Macintosh.

653
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,338
Rym: They're not going to say Golden Delicious or Fuji as opposed to Gala.

654
00:30:05,505 --> 00:30:06,799
Scott: Yeah, I don't even know what the fuck.

655
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,160
Scott: Macoon is an empire.

656
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,740
Scott: Apples are named Empire Apples because it's the Empire State.

657
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,500
Rym: Also, Empire Apples fucking suck.

658
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,158
Scott: They're not that good.

659
00:30:13,282 --> 00:30:13,959
Scott: They're they're awful.

660
00:30:14,261 --> 00:30:15,359
Scott: They're not awful, but they're not great.

661
00:30:16,301 --> 00:30:19,680
Rym: They're my second least favorite edible non-cooking apple.

662
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,617
Scott: I do not choose them.

663
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,900
Rym: My least favorite, if I had to say, I actually really don't like Granny Smith apples.

664
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,500
Scott: No, I like Granny Smith apples.

665
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,280
Rym: I like them cooking.

666
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,537
Rym: I don't like eating them.

667
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,820
Scott: See, the Red Delicious, I mean, it's not good.

668
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,360
Rym: Fuck the Red Delicious.

669
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:34,978
Scott: It's not good.

670
00:30:36,163 --> 00:30:36,819
Scott: It's mealy.

671
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:37,979
Rym: It's kind of mushy.

672
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,580
Rym: It's flavor.

673
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,240
Rym: It's like too sweet and at the same time not bodily enough.

674
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,200
Rym: And the skin's way too thick.

675
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,739
Scott: It's actually a really great article online about why the Red Delicious is the way it is.

676
00:30:46,341 --> 00:30:49,860
Scott: But the thing about the Red Delicious is it's not all bad, right?

677
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:53,400
Scott: The flavor that it does have is a good flavor.

678
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,740
Scott: It's just in most of the apples that flavor is mad weak.

679
00:30:56,242 --> 00:31:01,180
Scott: And if you could get an apple that had the Red Delicious's flavor but was strong, it would be a great apple.

680
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:07,099
Scott: So, Scott, the other problem thing about the Red Delicious, the good thing about it is the lumps on the bottom.

681
00:31:08,106 --> 00:31:09,060
Rym: I do like those lumps.

682
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,380
Rym: I was going to bring up those lumps.

683
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:15,780
Scott: The shape of the Red Delicious apple is the optimal shape, I feel, right?

684
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,399
Scott: So it's like they genetic engineered many aspects of it.

685
00:31:18,901 --> 00:31:25,440
Scott: And the only aspect they lost while breeding the Red Delicious for all factors was taste strength.

686
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:33,160
Scott: If they could find a way to just engineer it and bring back that flavor hardcore, that might move up to like number one, two, three apple.

687
00:31:34,302 --> 00:31:37,820
Scott: But right now it's hanging out there with Empire apples at this point.

688
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,460
Rym: I'm going to describe an apple to you that I didn't know existed.

689
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,100
Rym: That's recent.

690
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,238
Rym: It's a recent cultivar.

691
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:48,937
Rym: "Juicy and sweet and viewed by many as the successor to the

692
00:31:49,017 --> 00:31:49,659
Rym: Honeycrisp."

693
00:31:50,061 --> 00:31:51,359
Rym: The successor to the Honeycrisp?

694
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:51,693
Rym: Yes.

695
00:31:51,964 --> 00:31:52,157
Scott: Okay.

696
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,778
Rym: The Sweetango.

697
00:31:54,408 --> 00:31:54,820
Scott: All right.

698
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,398
Scott: Never heard of it.

699
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,160
Rym: Developed in 2009 in Minnesota, don't you?

700
00:31:58,444 --> 00:31:58,799
Rym: Oh, my God.

701
00:31:58,881 --> 00:32:00,239
Rym: It has its own Wikipedia page.

702
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,120
Scott: Is it like patented and licensed?

703
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:02,521
Scott: U.S.

704
00:32:02,582 --> 00:32:03,306
Rym: patent PP 18812P3.

705
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,440
Rym: Right.

706
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:10,791
Scott: So there's that 557 apple or five sevens.

707
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,340
Scott: Can you find the number on that list of apple varieties?

708
00:32:14,841 --> 00:32:17,420
Rym: It's kind of hard because there's a lot of varieties that are bullshit.

709
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,660
Scott: Press control F and type the word five or the number five.

710
00:32:22,251 --> 00:32:22,380
Rym: Yeah.

711
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,420
Rym: The number five turns up all the time on this page and the word five doesn't.

712
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:35,259
Scott: But we were driving back from Albany to New York and we went over the Rip Van Winkle bridge and we went down this road that was pretty much nothing but farm stands and they were all selling apples.

713
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:38,820
Scott: Stupidly, because we stopped in the first one because we didn't know better.

714
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,339
Scott: We didn't realize there were more down the road.

715
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:40,548
Rym: Yeah.

716
00:32:42,262 --> 00:32:46,899
Scott: And I bought a sack of apples and he said those apples are basically Honeycrisp apples, but softer.

717
00:32:47,002 --> 00:32:47,539
Scott: And they were called.

718
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:52,270
Scott: They were like five seven seven or five five seven or some numbered like they didn't have a name.

719
00:32:53,743 --> 00:32:56,120
Scott: And I got him and he was not lying.

720
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:03,560
Scott: They were basically sort of like the shape and size of Macintosh apples, but they were tasted just like Honeycrisp apples.

721
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,360
Scott: Only they were softer and not as crisp, but just as much honey.

722
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:07,655
Rym: Yep.

723
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:09,039
Rym: I'm a recent fan of Honeycrisp.

724
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,500
Rym: But when I was a kid, my favorite apple was and it's still one of my favorites, the Golden Delicious.

725
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,199
Rym: It's a standard apple.

726
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:16,977
Rym: It's crisp.

727
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:24,060
Rym: The things I hate, I hate mealy apples, like apples that have that kind of like mealy, like like when they're when the texture is inconsistent.

728
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:29,199
Rym: Inconsistency is the worst possible thing you can do in an apple for me.

729
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:33,680
Scott: Well, eating, you know, at the correct time of ripeness is also important for such factors.

730
00:33:33,722 --> 00:33:33,810
Scott: Yeah.

731
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,191
Rym: Right.

732
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,379
Scott: If it's under ripe, it'll probably be too hard.

733
00:33:36,863 --> 00:33:38,359
Scott: And if it's too late, it'll be all mushy.

734
00:33:39,244 --> 00:33:40,620
Rym: So you want to know something really tragic?

735
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:51,580
Rym: I don't know how many listeners know this, but I cannot often eat fresh apples anymore because I I'm allergic to like stuff in the air, like pollen and things.

736
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,340
Rym: I'm allergic to birch pollen in particular.

737
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,150
Rym: So one day as a wildwood, I love apples.

738
00:33:58,307 --> 00:33:58,920
Rym: I love apple cider.

739
00:33:59,140 --> 00:33:59,679
Scott: You want a birch tree?

740
00:34:00,382 --> 00:34:01,220
Rym: Yeah, I like birch trees.

741
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:01,938
Scott: Should I get you one?

742
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:02,680
Rym: Not really.

743
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,040
Scott: No, so I'll just put one in your house.

744
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:09,020
Rym: One day I'm in Wildwood and Scojo's mom like cut up some apples.

745
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,179
Rym: She's like, hey, you want some apples?

746
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,059
Rym: I was like, fuck yeah.

747
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:18,460
Rym: So I was eating the ice and apples and then my throat, like, you know, you know that feeling when you have something like stuck in your throat, like you scratched your throat or something.

748
00:34:19,005 --> 00:34:19,800
Rym: So I get that feeling.

749
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:23,020
Rym: I'm like, yeah, I guess I didn't chew that apple enough.

750
00:34:23,723 --> 00:34:31,980
Rym: And then I go into the bathroom because I could really like, ah, and I look at my throat and my throat is completely red and fully swollen internally.

751
00:34:32,902 --> 00:34:34,400
Rym: I'm like, oh, that's weird.

752
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:38,659
Rym: So then like a month or two later, I'm eating an apple.

753
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,496
Rym: The same thing happens.

754
00:34:41,264 --> 00:34:42,179
Rym: And I'm like, what?

755
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:52,000
Rym: So I did some experimentation and I discovered that sometimes, but not all times when I ate an apple, that would happen, but it did not happen with cooked apples or peeled apples.

756
00:34:52,543 --> 00:34:55,119
Rym: And it did not happen with all fresh apples.

757
00:34:56,445 --> 00:34:57,560
Scott: So the apples.

758
00:34:58,028 --> 00:34:58,160
Rym: Yes.

759
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,120
Rym: I tried washing the apple.

760
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:06,599
Rym: So I talked to a doctor and basically what they said was that birch pollen and other pollens like that can impregnate the skins of apples.

761
00:35:07,621 --> 00:35:17,860
Rym: And if you are allergic to those pollens, you will then be unable to eat that apple unless it is cooked or the skin is fully, fully removed.

762
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:22,041
Rym: The cooking breaks the pollen down usually, or it's diluted enough to where it doesn't matter.

763
00:35:22,964 --> 00:35:33,760
Rym: So as a result, I no longer just eat apples from apple picking because it's very rare in New York that I can get non birch tree impregnated apples as your last.

764
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,071
Scott: Yeah.

765
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:40,880
Rym: So as you come to the apple house, as a result, I have become very, very much more so a fan than I was before.

766
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:47,360
Rym: And I was already quite a fan of apple pie, apple cobbler, apple crumble, baked apple.

767
00:35:48,422 --> 00:35:51,980
Scott: I mean, apples pretty much like the best tasting fruit, probably.

768
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,288
Rym: What's your favorite way to prepare an apple?

769
00:35:55,312 --> 00:35:59,319
Rym: like an apple, like a prepared apple of some kind, not just a raw apple, not just eating it straight up.

770
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,599
Rym: Or is that your favorite way?

771
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:01,939
Scott: No, that's not the very way.

772
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,320
Scott: So what you do is it is a baked apple, but obviously you don't just put it in the oven.

773
00:36:06,648 --> 00:36:06,839
Scott: Right.

774
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:11,080
Rym: That was not obvious to a lot of people, including us at one point in our lives.

775
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:15,220
Scott: So to make a baked apple, you got to get a big ass apple instead of a baking kind.

776
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,199
Scott: There are certain varieties that are good for doing this.

777
00:36:18,262 --> 00:36:28,140
Scott: You basically take the car out because you need to be able to put stuff in the apple like cinnamon or maybe honeys or, you know, sugar, things that you can put in the apple.

778
00:36:28,882 --> 00:36:32,280
Scott: And then you wrap that motherfucker in tin foil, seal it up good.

779
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:37,136
Scott: And then you put a whole bunch of those in the oven together for the right amount of time.

780
00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:47,299
Scott: And then you take them out and they're all squishy, but not too squishy and impregnated with not pollen, but cinnamon sugar deliciousness.

781
00:36:48,661 --> 00:36:52,499
Scott: And then it's all warm and because it's cold out and then you eat that.

782
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:57,380
Scott: And it's basically like if you think the apple pie filling tastes good.

783
00:36:57,681 --> 00:36:57,785
Scott: Right.

784
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,859
Scott: You're basically getting the crack version.

785
00:37:00,942 --> 00:37:05,499
Scott: If apple pie filling is, you know, Tylenol, you're basically just like, all right, let's just go morphine.

786
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,077
Scott: Let's do it.

787
00:37:06,343 --> 00:37:06,536
Scott: Heroin.

788
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:06,914
Scott: Fuck it.

789
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:13,060
Rym: See, my only the only reason why I'm actually going to say that an apple crumble is my favorite is that that also has that.

790
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,360
Rym: That's like concentrated just like apple pie filling.

791
00:37:15,921 --> 00:37:20,380
Scott: But you've got some pastry instead of having an actual pie crust.

792
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,599
Scott: You just sort of crumble some shit on top because you're lazy and you can't bake properly.

793
00:37:24,072 --> 00:37:24,239
Scott: Yeah.

794
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:26,340
Rym: Or there's apple crumbles are subtle.

795
00:37:27,184 --> 00:37:29,180
Scott: Apple crumble is basically lazy apple pie.

796
00:37:29,722 --> 00:37:32,040
Scott: It's so I can't be bothered to make a crust because it's too hard.

797
00:37:32,341 --> 00:37:34,619
Scott: I'm just going to sprinkle a bunch of crumbs on top.

798
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,800
Rym: And there are there's apple pie filling.

799
00:37:37,282 --> 00:37:42,840
Rym: But if it's a fresh apple or recently apples, I prefer apple crumble, like whole, you know, make apple crumble.

800
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:51,780
Rym: If it's not, I prefer apple strudel because I really like the pastry part of pastries.

801
00:37:52,365 --> 00:37:53,980
Rym: to the point bread is delicious.

802
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:54,460
Rym: Yes.

803
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,099
Scott: Sugar bread is more delicious.

804
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:59,000
Rym: That's why I like things like chicken pot pies.

805
00:38:00,081 --> 00:38:07,040
Rym: Apple strudel has the optimal ratio of pastry to apple for maximum deliciousity.

806
00:38:08,162 --> 00:38:11,980
Scott: I mean, my mom makes this apple cake, which I have the recipe for where you cake.

807
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:12,400
Scott: Yeah.

808
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:16,700
Scott: Where you basically just like it's really just really sugary cake.

809
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:22,939
Scott: And then you sort of put the batter in the pan and then you put a layer of apple and then more batter and then more apple.

810
00:38:24,784 --> 00:38:25,849
Scott: And then you bake it.

811
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:31,650
Scott: It's basically a crazy sugary cake with apples slices in the middle of it.

812
00:38:31,971 --> 00:38:33,047
Scott: Yeah, that's good enough for me.

813
00:38:33,877 --> 00:38:34,286
Scott: I'll take it.

814
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:35,950
Rym: I do also like apple and salads.

815
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,270
Rym: Like I like to make a salad with like walnuts and apples.

816
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:40,450
Scott: That's that's a plus salad right there.

817
00:38:40,911 --> 00:38:44,090
Scott: It's got to be when I go to fresh coat, like there's only two salads I get.

818
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:48,410
Scott: There's basically the taco in a bowl salad.

819
00:38:49,071 --> 00:38:57,790
Scott: The fried chicken, plus Tex-Mex dressing, plus peppers and tortilla strip thing.

820
00:38:58,871 --> 00:38:59,790
Rym: Midwestern or salad.

821
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,708
Scott: I went to Chipotle last week.

822
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:11,590
Scott: And then the the apple, you know, walnut, blue cheese, lettuce kind of salad.

823
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:14,650
Scott: Those are the two kind.

824
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,230
Rym: So cider donuts, of course, are not relevant to this at all.

825
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:25,290
Scott: But actual cider donuts, even the best ones I've had, don't have a strong apple flavor.

826
00:39:25,491 --> 00:39:29,130
Scott: No, I made ones and I tried to get a strong cider flavor and it was very difficult.

827
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,280
Rym: Yeah, I think that's just.

828
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,250
Rym: that's not the kind of thing you do.

829
00:39:31,391 --> 00:39:32,249
Rym: That's it's a doughnut.

830
00:39:32,613 --> 00:39:33,950
Rym: It's a doughnut that you eat with cider.

831
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:35,929
Rym: Yeah, that is the way that actually goes down.

832
00:39:36,511 --> 00:39:40,670
Rym: But apple cider is still one of my favorite goddamn things.

833
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:41,830
Scott: Apple cider is best.

834
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,503
Scott: It's basically apple juice powered up.

835
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:53,750
Rym: So for non-Americans, which I know there are many of you in America, what we call apple cider, you just call apple juice.

836
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:54,248
Scott: Yep.

837
00:39:54,911 --> 00:40:00,690
Rym: And what you call apple cider, we call hard apple cider because there's alcohol in it.

838
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:00,939
Rym: Right.

839
00:40:01,171 --> 00:40:04,190
Rym: And I don't know if you have what we call apple juice.

840
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,429
Scott: They do have what we call apple.

841
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,350
Rym: What do you call it?

842
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,310
Rym: Everyone calls it something different.

843
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,390
Scott: I don't know what they call it.

844
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:11,630
Rym: In some places I've had it called clarified apple juice.

845
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:12,427
Scott: I've seen that.

846
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:13,709
Rym: Clear apple juice.

847
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:14,228
Rym: Seen it.

848
00:40:14,491 --> 00:40:17,870
Rym: Or like as one, one, it was always, you could only get it carbonated.

849
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:18,689
Rym: It was apple spritzer.

850
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:28,030
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, I'm always complaining like how wine has so many fucking varieties and grapes have so many varieties, but the other fruits don't get as much attention.

851
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,130
Scott: Apple comes the closest.

852
00:40:29,252 --> 00:40:29,729
Rym: Yeah, it does.

853
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,390
Scott: They're even in the grocery stores.

854
00:40:31,672 --> 00:40:34,290
Scott: There are quite a few varieties of apple juice that you can get.

855
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:38,749
Scott: You can get apple juice made with different, like there's a place red jacket near us.

856
00:40:39,171 --> 00:40:41,430
Scott: You can get Fuji apple juice specifically.

857
00:40:41,712 --> 00:40:44,229
Rym: That's also, that's where the granny smith is most used for me.

858
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,170
Rym: I like granny smith cider.

859
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:49,390
Scott: You can get also like strawberry apple juice, which is flavored apple juice.

860
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:55,110
Scott: Yeah, but like even if you go to a normal grocery store, they have different apple juices.

861
00:40:55,370 --> 00:41:04,710
Scott: They have like the one that's just like from concentrate, not from concentrate, you know, sort of natural, which is darker and has some sort of pulp and more stuff in it.

862
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:07,990
Scott: And they actually do taste ridiculously different.

863
00:41:08,572 --> 00:41:17,470
Scott: Like the Indian summer apple juice is not from concentrate, even though it's clarified, it has sort of has a darker golden color to it and it tastes different from the store brand one.

864
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:28,149
Scott: And there's a lot of different apple juices and even apple ciders from different farms, you know, taste noticeably and extremely different in the ways that, you know, wines from different grapes will taste different.

865
00:41:29,652 --> 00:41:33,370
Scott: And I wish there was some more respect for apple juice the way there's respect for wine.

866
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:39,310
Rym: Because apple juice, I get the impression is seen by many people, especially in the US as like a little kid drink.

867
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,729
Rym: Like, do you want some apple juice?

868
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:43,109
Scott: Well, I mean, Hannibal Burress has that whole joke.

869
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:49,150
Scott: He's like checking out of the grocery store and he's like, this guy's looking at me and he's just jealous of my apple juice.

870
00:41:51,112 --> 00:41:53,570
Scott: If you don't know who Hannibal Burress is, you should search for him on YouTube.

871
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:55,630
Scott: He's a great New York standup comedian.

872
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:56,270
Scott: He's hilarious.

873
00:41:56,710 --> 00:42:00,710
Scott: And his apple juice is probably going to be the number one result if you search for him.

874
00:42:00,911 --> 00:42:03,409
Rym: So I was, I encountered something I'd never had before.

875
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:12,970
Rym: Australia, in the US, like if you go to a bar, unless it's a cool craft bar, they'll have one or two ciders, like hard ciders, alcoholic ciders, like just fermented cider.

876
00:42:13,971 --> 00:42:17,150
Rym: But those are really just for the people who don't like beer and they're usually awful.

877
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:23,710
Rym: In Australia, cider had equal real estate in the bars to beer.

878
00:42:23,951 --> 00:42:24,950
Scott: They had that many apples there?

879
00:42:25,521 --> 00:42:25,689
Rym: Yes.

880
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,830
Rym: And they had that many ciders there and the ciders were good.

881
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,190
Scott: What kind of apples grow in Australia?

882
00:42:30,393 --> 00:42:31,430
Rym: I have fucking no idea.

883
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:34,630
Rym: No one, people were mostly drinking cider, not eating apples.

884
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:35,650
Scott: They have like koala apples?

885
00:42:36,513 --> 00:42:37,149
Rym: Probably not.

886
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:39,149
Rym: Here, I'm going to search this list.

887
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:41,689
Rym: All right, so there's the Envy Apple in New Zealand.

888
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,036
Rym: Sweet and crispy.

889
00:42:44,056 --> 00:42:46,890
Rym: takes four to eight hours after cutting to start browning.

890
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:47,929
Rym: So it doesn't brown right away.

891
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:48,607
Scott: Wow, interesting.

892
00:42:49,511 --> 00:42:51,710
Rym: It's a Royal Gala crossed with a Braeburn.

893
00:42:52,178 --> 00:42:52,410
Rym: All right.

894
00:42:52,591 --> 00:42:53,208
Scott: I know those kinds.

895
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:53,948
Rym: All right, let's see.

896
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:58,248
Rym: Australia, T-R-A-U-S-T-R-A-L.

897
00:42:58,750 --> 00:42:59,810
Rym: All right, the Bismarck Apple.

898
00:42:59,931 --> 00:43:01,610
Scott: That sounds like a name of an Australian apple.

899
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:07,070
Rym: Medium-sized fruit, green and red skin, sharp in flavor and not a common apple.

900
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:08,010
Rym: Used only in cooking.

901
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:14,589
Scott: Usually things that have a sharp or like kind of flavor are usually the cooking apples, right?

902
00:43:15,252 --> 00:43:15,968
Rym: The Crips Pink.

903
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:22,289
Rym: Cooking and eating, crisp, very sweet, slightly tart, light red pink and light yellow green striped skin.

904
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:23,990
Scott: They seem to like the tart ones over there.

905
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:26,630
Rym: Granny Smith apparently is an Australian apple originally.

906
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:27,428
Scott: That's nice.

907
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:28,669
Scott: Someone brought it over.

908
00:43:29,012 --> 00:43:31,150
Rym: Widely sold in the UK, so it came over from there.

909
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:32,288
Rym: All right.

910
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,210
Rym: Once used to represent Apple Records.

911
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:35,010
Rym: Thanks, Wikipedia.

912
00:43:36,971 --> 00:43:38,349
Rym: The Sturmer Pippin.

913
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:39,709
Scott: That sounds an amazing name.

914
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:44,030
Rym: This has the longest text of any apple here.

915
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:45,550
Rym: It's actually from England.

916
00:43:45,711 --> 00:43:46,530
Rym: It was brought to our guys.

917
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,270
Scott: So it was brought to Australia from England.

918
00:43:48,691 --> 00:43:50,330
Scott: OK, so they traded for Granny Smith.

919
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:59,629
Rym: A medium-sized bright greenish yellow apple with reddish brown blush, often in one face only, white fleshed and crisp.

920
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:04,010
Rym: One of the best English keeping apples with proper storage.

921
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:07,569
Rym: Sturmer Pippin last four to five months.

922
00:44:08,452 --> 00:44:10,710
Rym: Whoa, this is from eighteen hundred to this apple.

923
00:44:11,471 --> 00:44:15,610
Rym: Flavor is sprightly more sharp than sweet when first picked.

924
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:18,029
Rym: I think a fanboy of this apple wrote this shit.

925
00:44:18,831 --> 00:44:20,105
Rym: Check the talk section on Wikipedia.

926
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:22,790
Rym: But improves dramatically in storage.

927
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:24,910
Rym: You know what I'm going to do after this episode?

928
00:44:25,011 --> 00:44:26,508
Rym: I'm going to add a citation needed for this.

929
00:44:27,672 --> 00:44:29,750
Rym: Becoming sweeter while this goes on for a while.

930
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:38,610
Rym: Oh, it was brought to Australia where it is still widely grown because it stores so well that could be shipped places.

931
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:41,810
Rym: And it is the parent of the Granny Smith.

932
00:44:42,632 --> 00:44:44,366
Scott: Oh, so they sent this to Australia.

933
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:48,269
Scott: The Australians read it into the Granny Smith and sent it back.

934
00:44:48,855 --> 00:44:49,129
Rym: Yeah.

935
00:44:50,279 --> 00:44:51,350
Scott: Look at that apple history.

936
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,350
Rym: All right, we've gone through all the major Australian cultivars.

937
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:59,479
Scott: You could have read this Wikipedia on apple varieties yourself, but you wouldn't have done that.

938
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:00,689
Scott: We did.

939
00:45:01,891 --> 00:45:15,326
Rym: OK, the paragraph on the apple cultivar page describing the Sturmer Pippin is shorter than the actual or longer, sorry, longer than the actual Wikipedia article on the Sturmer Pippin.

940
00:45:16,553 --> 00:45:19,068
Rym: So somebody's got some citing to do.

941
00:45:19,536 --> 00:45:19,909
Scott: Sure.

942
00:45:20,931 --> 00:45:21,896
Rym: Yeah, I got.

943
00:45:21,956 --> 00:45:24,309
Rym: this might be the first edit I've made to Wikipedia in a long time.

944
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:28,509
Scott: Do you have any apple related anecdotes besides getting allergic and horrible whatnots?

945
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:36,110
Rym: So when I was in Australia, because cider is like a real thing there and I wrote like everybody, like half the people at every gathering I went to was drinking cider.

946
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:36,910
Rym: It was all good cider.

947
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:39,950
Rym: Karen, who makes my favorite hop was like Japanese.

948
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:42,030
Scott: Oh, but over there, it was actually from Japan.

949
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:42,643
Rym: No.

950
00:45:43,071 --> 00:45:44,289
Rym: So they make it in.

951
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:45,390
Scott: It was from Canada.

952
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:46,408
Scott: It wasn't Canada, was it?

953
00:45:46,551 --> 00:45:48,190
Rym: It was imported from New Zealand.

954
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:48,950
Scott: What the fuck?

955
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:49,286
Scott: Yeah.

956
00:45:49,432 --> 00:45:50,329
Scott: Japan is so close.

957
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:53,349
Rym: And you know, when the US is imported from Canada, every beer.

958
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:59,429
Scott: And so all the German must be like, we should find a map of like all the Karen breweries because they must be all over the world.

959
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:00,529
Rym: They're always one.

960
00:46:00,772 --> 00:46:01,010
Scott: Just Karen.

961
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:03,369
Scott: They're always one country away from wherever you are.

962
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:10,249
Rym: There's a bunch of German beers that are manufactured and created close to Australia in countries that aren't Australia.

963
00:46:10,371 --> 00:46:11,890
Rym: So the German beers still say imported.

964
00:46:12,456 --> 00:46:13,029
Rym: It's everyone.

965
00:46:13,613 --> 00:46:16,230
Rym: But Karen also makes a cider.

966
00:46:18,054 --> 00:46:19,430
Rym: And it was fucking amazing.

967
00:46:19,751 --> 00:46:20,048
Rym: Okay.

968
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:21,510
Scott: I was made in New Zealand.

969
00:46:22,292 --> 00:46:23,383
Scott: Yeah, but it's the same recipe.

970
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,850
Rym: Like it's not different from the one in Japan.

971
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,470
Scott: It wasn't using Japanese apples or New Zealand apple.

972
00:46:28,671 --> 00:46:32,630
Rym: I have no idea what apple they use, but it was super, super, super good.

973
00:46:32,951 --> 00:46:34,847
Rym: I bought a bunch of it to bring back and then I drank it all.

974
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:37,230
Scott: What about that Applejack poison you get?

975
00:46:37,391 --> 00:46:38,068
Rym: I was going to get to that.

976
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:41,410
Rym: So I am very much a fan of Applejack.

977
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:42,710
Scott: Not the pony.

978
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:44,455
Rym: Well, I'm a fan of Applejack.

979
00:46:44,475 --> 00:46:55,589
Rym: the pony too, because in our forum, when ponies were like the exploding thing years ago, like when that was like, it's rising, you know, the harbor, the shifts were rising in the harbor around my little pony.

980
00:46:56,912 --> 00:46:58,490
Rym: And there's the thread in our farm.

981
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:00,510
Rym: Everyone's going like, who's the best pony?

982
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:01,349
Rym: What's the order of ponies?

983
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:03,049
Rym: So everyone's ranking the ponies they like.

984
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:11,289
Rym: And five people in a row either only ranked non Applejack ponies or put Applejack last.

985
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:14,750
Rym: And then someone just posted this pissed off looking picture Applejack.

986
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:15,549
Rym: So I always think about that.

987
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:22,450
Rym: But now talking about Applejack the drink, which is properly like an English and Canadian thing, Michigan is kind of popular.

988
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:38,550
Rym: Basically the way you would make Applejack traditionally, you make cider, freeze the barrel of cider, cut the middle of the barrel out, let it thaw, freeze it again, cut the barrel out, and eventually you've got distilled cider.

989
00:47:41,691 --> 00:47:48,190
Rym: It's just alcohol with a like Apple hints to it because it's pretty much just alcohol.

990
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:49,870
Rym: I get there was a great, you distilled it so much.

991
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:50,949
Scott: All the apples been removed.

992
00:47:51,293 --> 00:47:51,970
Rym: It has a color.

993
00:47:52,432 --> 00:47:55,210
Rym: It has a color from the process, like this yellowish straw kind of color.

994
00:47:56,051 --> 00:48:03,210
Rym: And it does like, if you tasted it, Scott, you would say, wow, that tastes like poison and Apple like apples in there.

995
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:04,289
Rym: Apple has a, as a thing.

996
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:17,068
Rym: But when we went to the Cornelius distillery that makes it, because only recently is Applejack been recognized as something you're allowed to make for legal in the U S in most places, it's not going to make you blind.

997
00:48:17,631 --> 00:48:18,609
Rym: This will not make me blind.

998
00:48:18,911 --> 00:48:22,250
Rym: Maybe if you make it the old shitty way, but modern, you've distilled it a modern way.

999
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:24,528
Rym: Now you don't fraction, you don't freeze distill it.

1000
00:48:26,271 --> 00:48:31,748
Rym: So we were at the distillery and someone asked the question, what apples do you use?

1001
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,070
Rym: Like what varieties?

1002
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:34,350
Scott: They said it doesn't matter.

1003
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:38,430
Rym: He said whatever apples fell off the ground and no one like fell to the ground and no one pick.

1004
00:48:38,712 --> 00:48:39,709
Rym: It doesn't matter at all.

1005
00:48:39,971 --> 00:48:42,170
Rym: It has literally no possible impact.

1006
00:48:42,611 --> 00:48:50,770
Rym: It just has to be an Apple because you just need the sugar of Apple for the things, you know, and all the other things in Apple.

1007
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:55,110
Rym: So it, you know, is Applejack as opposed to like vodka or gin or some other thing.

1008
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:59,110
Rym: That shit is delicious and I'm almost out.

1009
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:03,330
Scott: But yeah, so Apple, speaking of apples on the ground, right?

1010
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:07,710
Scott: Unlike other fruits, which you can pick, Apple picking is the most common kind of picking.

1011
00:49:08,352 --> 00:49:09,850
Rym: Berry picking, super popular.

1012
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:13,170
Scott: Not as much as Apple though, because you're biased by the Northeast.

1013
00:49:13,655 --> 00:49:14,028
Scott: That's true.

1014
00:49:14,372 --> 00:49:15,109
Scott: Yes, that's true.

1015
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:16,030
Scott: But anyway, yes.

1016
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:20,553
Rym: In this area, Apple pickings, the only thing people are like, well, it's Apple picking side season.

1017
00:49:20,674 --> 00:49:23,490
Rym: Well, which weekends are we all going Apple picking guys?

1018
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:27,950
Scott: Well, the reason for it is because most people tend to only go to a farm like that.

1019
00:49:28,191 --> 00:49:34,430
Scott: If they're not farm folk to get a pumpkin in October, because, you know, you don't want to get one from the grocery store, right?

1020
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:35,269
Scott: You get one from the farm.

1021
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:36,330
Rym: Yeah, otherwise, what's the point?

1022
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:40,590
Scott: And when you go to the farm to get your pumpkin, well, happens to be Apple season.

1023
00:49:41,031 --> 00:49:45,330
Scott: We happen to be selling Apple cider and have an Apple picking at the same time.

1024
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:48,050
Scott: So you get a pumpkin and you're not going to get apples.

1025
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:49,590
Rym: You're not, you know, you're some parent.

1026
00:49:49,671 --> 00:49:51,769
Rym: You're not going to get the whole family in the minivan.

1027
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:55,150
Rym: Drive an hour to the farm just to buy a pumpkin and leave.

1028
00:49:55,251 --> 00:49:56,529
Rym: No, you're making it a half day trip.

1029
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:56,715
Rym: Yep.

1030
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:59,825
Rym: Get a walk around heading zoo maze maze.

1031
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:02,250
Scott: A lot of good shit going down there.

1032
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:04,810
Rym: I'm always amazed when I run into people who've never been Apple picking.

1033
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:07,130
Rym: Like you go Apple picking with someone who's never done it before.

1034
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:08,090
Scott: I don't know what the hell they like.

1035
00:50:08,612 --> 00:50:10,970
Rym: You hand them the thing to get the apples off the high branches.

1036
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:11,887
Rym: They don't know how to use it.

1037
00:50:12,115 --> 00:50:12,267
Scott: Right.

1038
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:15,990
Scott: So obviously you need that thing sometimes, but I never use it.

1039
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:24,830
Scott: I feel like, you know, the fun of Apple picking is trying to get the Apple with your own body, but people don't pick up the apples off the ground when they go Apple picking.

1040
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:28,449
Scott: Partly because some of the fun is getting the Apple off the tree and picking it.

1041
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:28,950
Rym: Yeah.

1042
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:33,190
Scott: It's not fun to pick up an Apple of the ground so much as it is to get one from a tree.

1043
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:36,649
Scott: But the apples in the ground are usually perfectly fine.

1044
00:50:37,792 --> 00:50:44,590
Rym: Most of the time, you know, if I just need, if I like depending on the Apple cultivars, those are the ones that are just now ripe, like perfectly.

1045
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:47,830
Scott: You think the ones that you got from the grocery store didn't never land on the ground.

1046
00:50:48,054 --> 00:50:48,410
Rym: You're full of it.

1047
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:48,890
Rym: Yeah.

1048
00:50:49,376 --> 00:50:49,609
Scott: Right.

1049
00:50:50,231 --> 00:50:50,810
Scott: That's bullshit.

1050
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:56,224
Rym: Like so the people who make Applejack will use machines to go get all the apples on the ground.

1051
00:50:56,657 --> 00:50:56,869
Scott: Yeah.

1052
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:01,450
Scott: But yeah, like if I see a really good Apple on the ground and it's perfectly fine, I'll.

1053
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:04,229
Scott: if it's, you know, if it's worth getting, I'm getting it.

1054
00:51:04,372 --> 00:51:04,645
Rym: Of course.

1055
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:08,610
Scott: But obviously I still mostly get it from tree because that's the fun of doing it.

1056
00:51:08,911 --> 00:51:11,509
Scott: If I just wanted the apples, I would just buy Apple.

1057
00:51:12,452 --> 00:51:16,430
Rym: When you reach up and you grab an Apple and you pull it and there's that moment where it separates.

1058
00:51:17,013 --> 00:51:18,050
Rym: That's a really good feeling.

1059
00:51:19,271 --> 00:51:26,368
Rym: Also, the thing though, kids, as much as I like to, when I was a kid, don't eat the apples while you're Apple picking, they're covered in pesticide.

1060
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:27,448
Scott: Yeah, it's not good.

1061
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:31,510
Scott: A lot of people in the guy will picking by the wrong amount of apples.

1062
00:51:32,242 --> 00:51:32,347
Rym: Yeah.

1063
00:51:32,611 --> 00:51:32,930
Rym: You know what?

1064
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:37,648
Scott: They give you, you buy like a bucket or a bag and you sort of feel like you have to fill it all the way.

1065
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:38,408
Rym: Here's the rule.

1066
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:42,229
Rym: However many people you have, you need one bucket or bag.

1067
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:42,748
Scott: Yep.

1068
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:43,158
Scott: Total.

1069
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:43,806
Scott: Yep.

1070
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:45,449
Rym: With any number of people.

1071
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:45,840
Scott: Yep.

1072
00:51:46,412 --> 00:51:47,068
Rym: That is the rule.

1073
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:51,010
Scott: Unless you bake something serious, that takes a ton of fucking apples.

1074
00:51:51,670 --> 00:52:02,120
Scott: You are, if you pick up like a, you know, a pick or a bushel or whatever the fuck it is, a Peck, you're going to have more apples than you can eat and deal with and they'll just go bad sitting in that bag.

1075
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:04,050
Scott: and it won't be, it'll be a waste of money.

1076
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:19,482
Scott: Thankfully it's cheap, but still also make sure to go to the country store where they're making the cider donuts and pick up all the Apple related goodies like Apple butter, Apple jelly, Apple jam, apple cider,

1077
00:52:19,542 --> 00:52:23,863
Rym: popular media likes to make fun of the pumpkin spice as being the season, but Apple is pumpkin

1078
00:52:23,883 --> 00:52:24,024
Scott: spice.

1079
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,930
Scott: So here's the thing about pumpkin spice, right?

1080
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:27,688
Rym: It's not pumpkin.

1081
00:52:27,851 --> 00:52:29,550
Rym: It's the spices you put in pumpkin pie.

1082
00:52:29,752 --> 00:52:30,209
Scott: That's right.

1083
00:52:30,532 --> 00:52:31,969
Scott: It's mostly just like nutmeg and shit.

1084
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:33,549
Rym: It's also you assholes.

1085
00:52:34,153 --> 00:52:35,630
Rym: There's no pumpkin in your pumpkin pie.

1086
00:52:35,671 --> 00:52:36,869
Rym: That's some bullshit squash.

1087
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:37,408
Scott: Yep.

1088
00:52:38,274 --> 00:52:39,470
Rym: I've had real pumpkin pie.

1089
00:52:39,633 --> 00:52:39,910
Rym: You know what?

1090
00:52:40,251 --> 00:52:42,770
Rym: Real pumpkin pie has some stringy bullshit in it.

1091
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:43,061
Rym: You know why?

1092
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:45,168
Rym: Cause pumpkins have stringy bullshit in them.

1093
00:52:45,351 --> 00:52:45,989
Scott: I don't eat pumpkin.

1094
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:46,910
Scott: Pumpkin is not for eating.

1095
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:47,790
Rym: Cause you're a terrible person.

1096
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:49,590
Scott: But Apple is for eating.

1097
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:51,088
Scott: So eat all the Apple.

1098
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:54,209
Scott: Brought to you by not Apple farmers of America.

1099
00:53:00,812 --> 00:53:03,330
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
