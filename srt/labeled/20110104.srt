1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,983
Rym: It's Tuesday January 4th 2011.

2
00:00:13,983 --> 00:00:16,794
Rym: I'm Rym Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:17,156 --> 00:00:18,240
Rym: super meat boy.

4
00:00:23,362 --> 00:00:24,357
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:27,743
Rym: See.

6
00:00:27,784 --> 00:00:29,510
Rym: if I hadn't said the year people wouldn't have known.

7
00:00:30,152 --> 00:00:32,220
Rym: I think they would know they would have no idea.

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:38,188
Rym: Especially you know 20 years from now when GeekNights is in the National Archives a national treasure, man They got to know.

9
00:00:38,855 --> 00:00:42,198
Scott: I'm sure It'll be a a big problem for them.

10
00:00:43,442 --> 00:00:44,729
Scott: They won't be able to look at the Dean.

11
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:49,651
Scott: you know the file the name of the file Maybe they won't or any of the ID in the far future.

12
00:00:49,671 --> 00:00:52,100
Rym: They won't have files or the website.

13
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:53,705
Rym: They won't have file names.

14
00:00:53,886 --> 00:00:55,311
Rym: the website long gone.

15
00:00:55,411 --> 00:00:55,672
Rym: Well.

16
00:00:55,732 --> 00:00:56,214
Scott: You know what.

17
00:00:56,394 --> 00:01:05,304
Scott: whatever there will be in the future I will update it to you know because you're gonna be alive If I am two dead.

18
00:01:05,324 --> 00:01:06,669
Scott: in that it is that I'm.

19
00:01:06,749 --> 00:01:09,097
Rym: at least I'm hoping that GeekNights will outlive me.

20
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:17,788
Scott: if it's two days In the future and I die tomorrow then oh well So we had our crazies.

21
00:01:18,029 --> 00:01:34,788
Rym: we might be a little low-energy tonight because we had our Annual New Year's Eve front row crew extravaganza, which this year was possibly the biggest one yet yet simultaneously in these smallest combined spaces No, no and it was the biggest.

22
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,280
Scott: we didn't count the bodies and a lot of the bodies are not simultaneous.

23
00:01:38,743 --> 00:01:41,500
Rym: But there was one moment when everybody was simultaneous.

24
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:45,711
Rym: Almost yeah, everybody everybody who came to New York.

25
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:48,020
Rym: at least there are a few people who weren't here at all.

26
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,066
Rym: They didn't fly out for obvious reasons bums.

27
00:01:50,688 --> 00:01:54,340
Rym: We had a big old party and a little tired played a lot of games.

28
00:01:54,882 --> 00:02:00,403
Rym: It's amazing how much Super Meatball is kind of a spectator sport almost more so than a single-player game Because it's more.

29
00:02:00,463 --> 00:02:05,600
Scott: what it more is when you have a whole bunch of people right like us playing it as a spectator sport.

30
00:02:05,741 --> 00:02:07,229
Scott: It's like you suck.

31
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:08,416
Scott: Let's see you do it bitch.

32
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:12,206
Rym: Oh It's like here.

33
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:13,475
Scott: let me show you how it's done.

34
00:02:13,555 --> 00:02:14,180
Scott: boom beaten.

35
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:17,572
Rym: A lot of people trash talk is surprising him out when they're not playing.

36
00:02:17,592 --> 00:02:19,840
Rym: if you hand him the controller nothing happens.

37
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:22,813
Scott: Hey, listen, you know I got into that that.

38
00:02:23,215 --> 00:02:24,139
Scott: what's that guy's name?

39
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,660
Rym: agmo agmo.

40
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:36,114
Scott: yeah, I was doing the agmo warp zone and we get to the final level of it and everyone was like looked at it and Was like ooh, and then I got up to the first Way up there right on the first go and they were like, oh snap.

41
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:39,287
Rym: It wasn't that hard though I was pretty easy to use.

42
00:02:39,608 --> 00:02:40,371
Scott: Yeah, he's pretty good.

43
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:41,014
Scott: He's slow.

44
00:02:41,235 --> 00:02:42,560
Rym: He's no good on any level.

45
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:44,479
Rym: Well, we'll talk about Super Meat Boy in a bit.

46
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:46,989
Rym: So I really briefly want a geek bite.

47
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,194
Rym: Cthulhu saves the world.

48
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:49,680
Scott: because I also played Cthulhu.

49
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:51,085
Rym: We all played the demo.

50
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:53,112
Rym: someone downloaded it on a box.

51
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:53,795
Rym: You did.

52
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:55,200
Rym: I played it a couple times.

53
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,225
Scott: I played it for lolz.

54
00:02:56,628 --> 00:02:58,860
Rym: Uh, it is not worth any amount of money.

55
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:03,060
Scott: I would not pay any money and even if it were I would pay one penny if it's not ready.

56
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:05,851
Rym: It is not worth the time to play it.

57
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:07,920
Scott: That is all well, it does have.

58
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:11,171
Scott: It doesn't have two things that other JR cuz it's JRPG.

59
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:11,653
Scott: No question.

60
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:13,158
Rym: It's basically a Cthulhu JRPG.

61
00:03:13,198 --> 00:03:13,640
Rym: You're Cthulhu.

62
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,334
Rym: He's on the Arlithotep or someone's taking away his power and to get it back.

63
00:03:17,374 --> 00:03:18,299
Rym: He has to be a good guy.

64
00:03:18,961 --> 00:03:20,386
Scott: Yeah, but the thing is right it does.

65
00:03:20,526 --> 00:03:25,402
Scott: it does have two things better than other JRPGs that make it maybe tolerable to beat the Whole thing.

66
00:03:25,482 --> 00:03:28,357
Scott: Well number one number one, you can run really fast on the map.

67
00:03:28,457 --> 00:03:28,839
Rym: That's okay.

68
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,863
Rym: I was talking more.

69
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:34,536
Rym: number two you once you have done 25 random encounters in an area.

70
00:03:34,777 --> 00:03:35,820
Rym: They will never happen again.

71
00:03:35,941 --> 00:03:37,412
Scott: Well, at least the first area.

72
00:03:37,452 --> 00:03:38,420
Scott: the number is 25.

73
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:44,774
Scott: I don't know what the number is in other areas and it's you can turn them back on if you want but basically each area has a number of encounters.

74
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:50,833
Scott: that is the limit of Random encounters in that area which is genius right because that it's.

75
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:56,436
Scott: it's so perfect because look a lot of times You know, you don't know how what how much should I level up?

76
00:03:56,456 --> 00:03:57,260
Scott: Well, this game is like here.

77
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,347
Scott: This is how much you should level up.

78
00:03:58,387 --> 00:04:04,196
Scott: and the third thing it does which you probably didn't realize After you do a combat you get full HPs.

79
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:07,280
Scott: afterwards You only need to heal if you're gonna die in the combat.

80
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:15,179
Rym: Of course that doesn't remove one of the aspects of the JRPG which is often there the I'm running low on Supplies and need to make it out of here.

81
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,583
Scott: Mmm, who cares?

82
00:04:17,603 --> 00:04:18,625
Rym: That depends.

83
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,714
Scott: The only reason to play this game is for the lulls.

84
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:22,618
Rym: It's okay lulls.

85
00:04:22,658 --> 00:04:23,300
Rym: It's not great.

86
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,403
Scott: I thought it was good lulls.

87
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:24,945
Rym: It was okay.

88
00:04:24,985 --> 00:04:27,112
Rym: The thing is it was a little predictable.

89
00:04:27,694 --> 00:04:31,924
Rym: Yeah, the jokes were a little bit Obvious and ham-fisted.

90
00:04:31,944 --> 00:04:33,247
Scott: I think they were lulls.

91
00:04:33,468 --> 00:04:34,290
Rym: She's a groupie.

92
00:04:34,551 --> 00:04:35,754
Rym: He could thoroughly gets a groupie.

93
00:04:35,895 --> 00:04:37,820
Rym: She follows him around stuff like that.

94
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,830
Scott: Yeah, I think is the demo is one of the time limit demos.

95
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:47,753
Scott: So I ran really really fast to try to get to the To the you know to see as much content as possible.

96
00:04:47,773 --> 00:04:49,360
Rym: I got to that other adventuring party.

97
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,144
Scott: Yeah, that's where I got.

98
00:04:50,305 --> 00:04:55,434
Rym: beat them by holding a beat everything by holding a yep Everything by holding a. the combat is kind of a combo system.

99
00:04:55,455 --> 00:04:56,078
Scott: That is that is.

100
00:04:56,179 --> 00:05:00,780
Scott: one thing I didn't like though is that you None of the moves have really different animations.

101
00:05:01,322 --> 00:05:05,179
Scott: That's one that you know, like a Pokemon you want to turn the animations off but not until you've seen them.

102
00:05:05,532 --> 00:05:15,360
Scott: Yes Even in like Final Fantasy 4 all the spells had cool stuff going on at least one I never saw like a through who hit anyone with a sword or wrap his tentacles around anyone or anything like that.

103
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:21,760
Rym: Yeah, my insanity strike was just but oop, yep boring though you get points for being able to make monsters go insane.

104
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,911
Rym: I never figured out what that did because they died at the same time as that.

105
00:05:24,931 --> 00:05:25,674
Rym: they went insane.

106
00:05:26,135 --> 00:05:28,665
Scott: I think that's the point Is that you can make.

107
00:05:28,765 --> 00:05:32,160
Scott: you can kill them by making them too insane and you can also kill them by killing them.

108
00:05:32,301 --> 00:05:33,472
Rym: So two things that bother me.

109
00:05:33,492 --> 00:05:40,420
Rym: one You get some good guy to join your party and she has powers that make people go insane just like Cthulhu does.

110
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:51,658
Rym: And two you rescue her from two monsters that are basically this game's equivalent of imps and She in your party is immediately powerful enough to take on infinity imps.

111
00:05:52,867 --> 00:05:53,897
Rym: So what the hell game?

112
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,000
Rym: But Cthulhu does make this good face where he's kind of like, uh all the time.

113
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,090
Scott: It's not about making sense right?

114
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,180
Scott: and I you know, this is another thing that bothers me.

115
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,500
Scott: It's like we see in gaming as a whole this today, right?

116
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:19,797
Scott: A lot of people are taking this route where they find a genre of game and instead of You know fixing the fundamental problems of the genre which basically means making a fundamentally different game.

117
00:06:19,817 --> 00:06:20,620
Scott: That's not in the genre.

118
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:28,200
Scott: What they do is they polish The problems of the genre so that they bother you as little as possible.

119
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:34,232
Scott: For example random encounters bother you in the JRPGs Oh like earthbound for example, right random encounters bother you.

120
00:06:34,252 --> 00:06:37,183
Scott: well if the monsters too weak you just win Right.

121
00:06:37,724 --> 00:06:39,168
Scott: or oh, it's.

122
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:43,140
Scott: it's really bothersome to organize all your equipment and to purchase the right equipment.

123
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,752
Scott: So we'll put in an auto buying button.

124
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,822
Scott: It automatically buys the best equipment It's.

125
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:51,060
Scott: why don't you just remove the equipment buying from the game?

126
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,757
Rym: Well, you see the slippery slope there is press a to play the game optimally and see all the cutscenes in order.

127
00:06:56,777 --> 00:07:01,319
Scott: in other words Why the fuck did you make a video game just make a video on YouTube?

128
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:09,465
Scott: And that's I think a lot of the point-and-click adventure games that are pretty much trial and error until you see the next piece of Plot really should do that.

129
00:07:09,545 --> 00:07:10,408
Scott: They should just be.

130
00:07:10,428 --> 00:07:12,434
Scott: you know, here are you.

131
00:07:12,454 --> 00:07:14,420
Scott: make interactive choose your own adventure book?

132
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,040
Rym: So Scott you've gotten very close to my point.

133
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:23,855
Rym: the reason I wanted to geek by Cthulhu saves the world is that it's a. I like the idea taking the piss out of a Genre and you know throwing in a geeky element.

134
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:27,857
Rym: I mean Charles Barkley shut up and jam guy Dan.

135
00:07:27,977 --> 00:07:31,739
Rym: Oh, yeah I don't want to play that but I enjoy the idea of it so much.

136
00:07:32,021 --> 00:07:35,614
Rym: I like saying the name of it Charles Barkley shut up and jam guy dad.

137
00:07:35,835 --> 00:07:36,035
Scott: Yep.

138
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:48,840
Rym: Hey dad but we have a problem now in the gaming industry with games like this where I am Pirating all of the games like this by watching other people play them on YouTube.

139
00:07:49,283 --> 00:07:57,860
Rym: Mm-hmm now it's not necessarily I mean Is it Piracy to take a video of a game and put it online because it cannot replace the experience of playing.

140
00:07:58,163 --> 00:08:00,180
Rym: Oh, wait, it can replace the experience of playing the game.

141
00:08:01,123 --> 00:08:03,109
Rym: Some games I mean in a JRPG.

142
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:05,456
Rym: you can just sit there with the controller and hold a the whole time.

143
00:08:05,737 --> 00:08:11,853
Rym: Yeah Or like poker night same thing.

144
00:08:11,893 --> 00:08:13,220
Rym: I just watched it Cthulhu.

145
00:08:13,481 --> 00:08:16,840
Rym: I'll probably watch some YouTube highlights to make sure I don't miss all the good jokes.

146
00:08:17,444 --> 00:08:18,532
Rym: Maybe I'll read the game fat.

147
00:08:18,573 --> 00:08:33,019
Scott: something I've been doing With the point-and-click adventure games is I haven't watched them on YouTube But I get the fact and I basically blow through it real fast You know without you know having to sit there for an hour Clicking on every single thing on the screen with every single other thing on the screen.

148
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:40,443
Scott: I did it with Machinarium and it basically took about the same amount of time You know to play it on YouTube as it did to You know.

149
00:08:40,726 --> 00:08:42,960
Scott: just go with the fact and with the fact you get better resolution.

150
00:08:43,381 --> 00:08:50,900
Rym: See at least the quest for glory games after the first one As point-and-click adventures or type and move around to the keyboard adventures.

151
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:55,660
Rym: It was mostly logical puzzles that you could just solve and they were actually interesting.

152
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,587
Rym: It wasn't the arbitrary walk into a room take every item and use that everything see all the deaths and eventually one of them Lets you go to the next room.

153
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,960
Scott: Yeah, there is this one I forget the name of it that I got in some steam sale.

154
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:07,688
Scott: That's basically this pirate dog.

155
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,040
Scott: and the thing was that one is actually funny.

156
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,626
Scott: I was like, oh man, so I've been.

157
00:09:11,726 --> 00:09:14,576
Scott: I've been going through that slowly with the fact so it is.

158
00:09:14,837 --> 00:09:15,680
Scott: it is pretty logical.

159
00:09:15,761 --> 00:09:17,740
Scott: It doesn't have too many arbitrary bullshits.

160
00:09:18,242 --> 00:09:22,120
Rym: But anyway, I do have an actual kind of gaming news that came up over the New Year's holiday.

161
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:27,773
Rym: That was kind of important As we always say mostly on Mondays because that's when the tech stuff comes up.

162
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:41,997
Rym: if you have to give The consumer access to the hardware at all as in they own the hardware or the hardware is in their house in any way You cannot have perfect DRM.

163
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:42,560
Scott: That's right.

164
00:09:43,145 --> 00:09:46,204
Rym: So the ps3 had DRM and it.

165
00:09:46,305 --> 00:09:49,794
Rym: you could sign games and the ps3 will only play signed games.

166
00:09:50,115 --> 00:10:10,882
Rym: and there's this whole system where if someone like They give a company a key that lets them sign games if they sign bad shit They could revoke those keys and force them to be reissued and they can update the ps3 firmware all sorts of stuff But there has to be somewhere a hardware master key and there is in fact a hardware master key and it has finally been Revealed.

167
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:21,440
Rym: so basically short of replacing ps3 hardware There is nothing Sony can do to prevent anyone from safely rooting their ps3s forever and you don't even need to root it.

168
00:10:21,763 --> 00:10:30,976
Rym: You can just download whatever pirated stuff or homebrew stuff people make because they can sign stuff legitimately and Sony cannot revoke the master key.

169
00:10:30,996 --> 00:10:32,866
Scott: Yep So it's like you can't.

170
00:10:32,947 --> 00:10:35,460
Scott: this isn't even a situation where you need a mod chip, right?

171
00:10:35,921 --> 00:10:41,434
Scott: Anyone can just make a blu-ray disc and the PlayStation will recognize it as legitimate.

172
00:10:41,755 --> 00:10:44,743
Scott: and since it's the master master key Right.

173
00:10:44,804 --> 00:10:56,228
Scott: It's like they can maybe update a firmware and put some sub master keys But they'd have to like redo their whole thing and then someone you know, it's it's pretty much doomsday for them in that department Yep, which has two primary uses.

174
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,453
Scott: It's not really a big change though.

175
00:10:57,473 --> 00:10:59,180
Scott: They used to let you run Linux on there and stuff.

176
00:10:59,822 --> 00:11:00,424
Scott: Not anymore though.

177
00:11:00,464 --> 00:11:05,060
Rym: Yeah, well then they took it away and today I cannot fathom why they also took away the backward compatibility.

178
00:11:06,462 --> 00:11:08,754
Rym: I just I don't get Sony the ps3 fee.

179
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:14,540
Rym: I feel like they're Japanese They don't get it, but it's it's languishing, but it's not failing the same as the PSP.

180
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:23,393
Rym: Yeah, the PSP is a solid second place, but it's second place Like hey guys, I'm still you know, any order the PSP go.

181
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:25,340
Scott: I mean everyone has the regular PSP.

182
00:11:25,521 --> 00:11:26,666
Scott: No one has that PSP go.

183
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,619
Rym: I know less than two or three people who have even PSPs.

184
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:36,415
Rym: I know right and I've thought about buying one like ten times, but then I look at the game list again, and I think yeah It's sort of like the PSP.

185
00:11:36,475 --> 00:11:45,515
Scott: for me It sort of has one of those game lists sort of like the Dreamcast does or like the Saturn right where there's some of these Quirky games that you're never gonna play anywhere else.

186
00:11:45,555 --> 00:11:52,619
Scott: that it's like, oh man I'd really like to play one or two of those but it's I'm not gonna get a whole system to play like that Weird Megaman game that came out for the PSP.

187
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:56,673
Scott: Yeah or Bar man for the Saturn or any of those kinds of things.

188
00:11:56,713 --> 00:11:59,760
Rym: the thing is most of the games I want to play like that Are old enough to wear emulation.

189
00:12:00,282 --> 00:12:05,180
Scott: Well, you know the thing is, you know as I was talking about before when I was discussing the maim failures.

190
00:12:05,382 --> 00:12:18,051
Scott: Right is in a previous episode Recent previous episode is that emulation is sort of failing for anything beyond like the ps1, you know Pretty much ps2 and on emulation is real weak.

191
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:20,059
Scott: and 64 emulation is there.

192
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:30,482
Rym: ish course that does make sense just because at least on Sony side with the cell processor and the way games work the Complexity of what needs to be emulated is Exponential.

193
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,211
Scott: it's a pretty much like everything ps1 and earlier.

194
00:12:33,632 --> 00:12:37,083
Scott: you can emulate but anything after that and you know You pretty much.

195
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:40,839
Scott: you're better off getting a system and then getting a mod chip and then getting copied.

196
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:46,736
Rym: now Meanwhile on the Microsoft side you basically have to emulate a Windows computer.

197
00:12:46,856 --> 00:12:47,939
Rym: Oh just run Windows.

198
00:12:51,512 --> 00:12:52,981
Rym: Okay, it's got any news you got.

199
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:54,610
Scott: well, it's sort of news.

200
00:12:54,992 --> 00:12:58,872
Scott: I mean this would normally be thing of the day material, but I'm gonna spin it as news Really?

201
00:12:58,932 --> 00:12:59,957
Scott: It's very important right?

202
00:12:59,977 --> 00:13:03,170
Rym: You want me to edit out that you're spinning it or you want the same to be a parent?

203
00:13:03,511 --> 00:13:03,949
Scott: It's fine.

204
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:09,067
Scott: There's these guys right and they made a thing and that's the news that these guys have accomplished this feat right.

205
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:14,230
Scott: the feet they have Accomplished is they have beaten quake one with a hundred percent secrets.

206
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:17,221
Scott: They got every secret and they got a hundred percent kills.

207
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:19,610
Scott: they killed everything and it was a speed run.

208
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,989
Scott: So they did it crazy fast and it was a team of guys.

209
00:13:22,891 --> 00:13:25,441
Scott: I'm not sure how much of it was like machine assisted.

210
00:13:25,461 --> 00:13:27,930
Rym: I'm I've decided I don't care anymore.

211
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:32,390
Scott: It doesn't really matter right whether they did save and load or retry or whatever, right?

212
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:47,304
Scott: the fact is you do it whether you do it that way or not, you're still doing it and they you know they basically each guy was responsible for certain levels and they they Combined all their successes together and created a single speedrun video and you can.

213
00:13:47,424 --> 00:13:48,146
Scott: it's on YouTube.

214
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:52,755
Scott: It's a quake one Done quickest.

215
00:13:53,196 --> 00:13:58,330
Rym: it does remind me if nothing else how fast and how crazy the quake one engine was.

216
00:13:58,553 --> 00:13:59,510
Scott: Yeah, that's you know.

217
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:02,309
Scott: The major reasons I want people to see this video are number one.

218
00:14:02,631 --> 00:14:06,108
Scott: You can see quake one if you haven't, you know gotten it on Steam or played it anything.

219
00:14:06,128 --> 00:14:07,673
Scott: it too You can see.

220
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:09,619
Scott: right, you know for many years.

221
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,710
Scott: We've been you know, having the constant debate has been ongoing of you know.

222
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:19,629
Scott: Oh, no console FPS is PC FPS is keyboard and mouse gamepad bla bla bla, right?

223
00:14:20,191 --> 00:14:25,590
Scott: And here this video better than any other that I've ever seen in many years illustrates in.

224
00:14:26,693 --> 00:14:29,150
Scott: You know for 40 minutes it illustrates.

225
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:36,159
Scott: Look, this is how a real, you know, you know Twitch hardcore FPS goes.

226
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,585
Scott: look how fast this is.

227
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,010
Scott: Look how fast they turn.

228
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,775
Scott: look at the maneuvers that are made.

229
00:14:40,835 --> 00:14:56,670
Scott: look at the precision and the speed of the aiming, you know, and There is absolutely no way that this can be possible Using analog sticks because while they are analog the same as a mouse and while they have two axis the same as a mouse They are limited.

230
00:14:56,971 --> 00:15:03,998
Scott: You can only push the stick so far to the left and then you will rotate to the left at the fastest speed Whereas with a mouse there is no limit.

231
00:15:04,018 --> 00:15:16,830
Scott: you can slide your mouse all the way across the desk at the high sensitivity and spin around, you know now it's a billion degree analog stick on a computer with Effectively infinite control much like with a mouse.

232
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:23,597
Rym: Like if you can sit there and decide the sensitivity at every threshold you could make an equivalent But humans might not be able to use it.

233
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:24,419
Scott: Yeah, basically.

234
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:34,910
Rym: Yeah, so, you know, you have to move the stick like, you know, two It is possible I'm just arguing that but no console FPS has ever done anything like that.

235
00:15:35,312 --> 00:15:36,760
Scott: No, I mean some of them do.

236
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,046
Scott: let you turn the sensitivity way up But it you know, just you know, the physicality of it makes it pretty impossible.

237
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:48,190
Scott: the other problem That I realized more recently with the console FPS is right is the twin stick, right?

238
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:55,682
Scott: so you got two thumbs on two sticks and you basically that leaves your You know index and ring and middle fingers to work.

239
00:15:55,762 --> 00:15:57,970
Scott: the left button right button left trigger right trigger.

240
00:15:58,431 --> 00:16:03,349
Scott: that gives you four buttons that you can press while simultaneously moving.

241
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,549
Rym: and Scott you can push in either of the sticks.

242
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:08,797
Scott: Okay, so six buttons you can do.

243
00:16:08,998 --> 00:16:12,770
Rym: of course that does disrupt your aiming but I guess that is lighter in a console FPS.

244
00:16:13,151 --> 00:16:19,030
Scott: Right, so you can move aim and push six buttons, you know simultaneously while moving and aiming.

245
00:16:19,452 --> 00:16:25,430
Scott: But with the mouse and keyboard you can push every button on the keyboard simultaneously to moving and aiming.

246
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:27,375
Rym: What I would like like.

247
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:32,350
Rym: you can jump shoot use an item do a backflip at what I would like though.

248
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:36,650
Rym: now Imagine this I have my keyboard, but I only use the compete the keyboard because it's kind of a basic thing.

249
00:16:36,731 --> 00:16:38,829
Rym: I just need a whole bunch of buttons in a grid.

250
00:16:39,452 --> 00:16:42,786
Rym: Ideally, I'd have a whole bunch of buttons in a grid and where my thumb goes.

251
00:16:42,846 --> 00:16:45,327
Rym: instead of buttons I would have an analog stick.

252
00:16:45,931 --> 00:16:48,900
Rym: Uh-huh, we're moving in the two-dimensional plane.

253
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:52,753
Rym: And then the mouse is the aiming in the two-dimensional plane Mm-hmm.

254
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:54,299
Rym: I guess you could go crazy.

255
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,335
Rym: true because he double fisted with two mice One with an array of.

256
00:16:58,395 --> 00:17:04,294
Scott: but that is true because you know for aiming you absolutely need the unlimited, you know Motion of a mouse.

257
00:17:04,374 --> 00:17:11,253
Scott: but for moving every FPS I've ever played ever as a limit to the speed of moving so you can't move Any faster, right?

258
00:17:11,575 --> 00:17:16,388
Scott: So an analog stick is just as good if not better for moving than a WASD.

259
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,898
Rym: No What I did do I have an aiming is far more.

260
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,930
Rym: I've made a video of it yet to put online.

261
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:24,300
Rym: But I've been experimenting with filming with a little HD camera.

262
00:17:24,622 --> 00:17:27,512
Rym: what my hands are doing on the keyboard on my hands doing on The mouse?

263
00:17:27,815 --> 00:17:30,170
Rym: what's going on on the screen when I play counter-strike?

264
00:17:30,511 --> 00:17:34,330
Scott: Mm-hmm, and a lot of fighting games do videos like that, which is very helpful.

265
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:35,271
Rym: Yep It is.

266
00:17:35,372 --> 00:17:46,450
Rym: it was kind of weird to watch myself because I feel you know when the APMs that Starcraft players talk about I see myself doing something similar when I play counter-strike when I'm like waiting for someone or I'm itching to shoot.

267
00:17:46,851 --> 00:17:53,269
Rym: I'm kind of going straight just like I'm hitting the strafe bunches like pop up up up up up up up back and forth all the time weird.

268
00:17:55,163 --> 00:18:02,646
Scott: Anyway, so yeah You should watch this video quake done 100% Quickest because a lot of the speed runs are all about just getting under the level.

269
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,390
Scott: It takes two seconds.

270
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:07,010
Scott: You're like what happened, but this one they actually kill all the bad guys.

271
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:10,790
Scott: So you can see a lot more aiming and shooting going on and that to avoid dying.

272
00:18:11,031 --> 00:18:12,174
Rym: I do have a confession to make.

273
00:18:12,816 --> 00:18:21,061
Rym: I never even played through more than like 10 levels in quake one single-player And I never played through most of quake 2 single-player.

274
00:18:21,382 --> 00:18:23,470
Rym: I started playing them once I learned how to play.

275
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,589
Rym: I immediately went to online deathmatch and never looked back.

276
00:18:27,413 --> 00:18:28,518
Rym: I basically had no like.

277
00:18:28,658 --> 00:18:31,510
Rym: I hated the single-player game - was a little better.

278
00:18:31,631 --> 00:18:32,898
Rym: There was more stuff going on.

279
00:18:32,938 --> 00:18:35,130
Scott: But even then I think there's about they were pretty equal.

280
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,409
Rym: I skipped and beat the end of both of them, but yeah.

281
00:18:44,004 --> 00:18:52,540
Rym: So things of the day, I know it's on College Humor But I found it pretty funny and everyone we know who isn't not scared of games found it desperately funny.

282
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,532
Rym: So I figure it's worth being a thing of the day.

283
00:18:55,257 --> 00:18:55,700
Rym: It's a dude.

284
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:03,360
Rym: They sounds like he's vaguely like he's in the same archetype of Dave Riley, but Dave Riley's not a goddamn pussy like this guy is.

285
00:19:04,301 --> 00:19:11,000
Rym: He's playing a recent scary video game and he's losing his shit as some people do when they play recent scary video games.

286
00:19:11,461 --> 00:19:12,646
Rym: Mmm, I find it hilarious.

287
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,131
Scott: I don't think it's that funny.

288
00:19:14,171 --> 00:19:14,894
Rym: I think it's pretty good.

289
00:19:14,914 --> 00:19:15,616
Scott: You're sort of sad.

290
00:19:15,636 --> 00:19:19,854
Rym: I Find it more funny than sad because he is enjoying himself.

291
00:19:20,276 --> 00:19:20,919
Scott: I think so.

292
00:19:21,341 --> 00:19:22,605
Rym: Maybe he wet himself.

293
00:19:23,187 --> 00:19:24,913
Scott: that might be true and that is sad.

294
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:26,237
Rym: All right, what do you have?

295
00:19:26,277 --> 00:19:27,060
Rym: What's better than that?

296
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:42,726
Scott: To check out this dude Right is a homeless dude in Columbus, Ohio the kind that stands on the higher side of the highway with a sign right and this guy goes up and pulls up next to him and this homeless dude somehow has Like a professional radio voice.

297
00:19:42,867 --> 00:19:45,275
Scott: and basically the story is this guy.

298
00:19:45,295 --> 00:19:46,579
Scott: he was growing up.

299
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:51,980
Scott: He got he like he met some radio guy and he fell in love with radio and he wanted to be a radio voice guy.

300
00:19:52,502 --> 00:19:53,890
Scott: He went to school for radio voice.

301
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,779
Scott: He got the great radio voice.

302
00:19:56,442 --> 00:20:00,960
Scott: His life was like, you know pretty good and then he got all druggy and it became a homeless bum.

303
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:13,599
Scott: but he says they do interview him and he does say that he's been clean for two years and he's not insane like most homeless people and he's just trying to you know, get by like a homeless person does.

304
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:20,302
Scott: and The one thing that I just don't understand is like if he's not insane and he has the radio voice Right.

305
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,770
Scott: This guy could be totally just fine.

306
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,900
Scott: It's like dude go take a shower cut off your homeless hair, right?

307
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,356
Scott: Yeah buy one pair of clothes, you know at at somewhere.

308
00:20:30,456 --> 00:20:31,099
Scott: I'll wait now.

309
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:31,259
Rym: now.

310
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:34,089
Rym: now I can tell you exactly how to get this guy back on his feet.

311
00:20:34,631 --> 00:20:37,160
Rym: step one go find Tay Zonday.

312
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:39,289
Rym: Step two get this guy.

313
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:43,345
Rym: step three put him in a recording studio Recorded chocolate rain duet.

314
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:48,220
Scott: sell a single, you know, I think this guy would be better for doing, you know, just voiceover stuff.

315
00:20:48,662 --> 00:20:51,760
Rym: Hey, it's Q 107 for the meme side of it.

316
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,820
Rym: If you get those two guys together, that would make meme magic.

317
00:20:55,124 --> 00:21:04,074
Scott: But I mean this guy, you know If the guy's not insane He can get a job at a McDonald's like boom instantly and even though he might not have a house yet He could save up, you know live in something.

318
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:07,814
Rym: if he lived nearby We could try to hire him to come to Connecticut and do all the announcements.

319
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:13,320
Scott: He's in Columbus, Ohio You know, another thing you could do is you go to any library where they have computers, right?

320
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,738
Scott: You get a cookie cutter website.

321
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:23,530
Scott: You know for zero dot a free cookie cutter crap website with some ads on it and then be like I will do Voiceovers for you five bucks, you know?

322
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,060
Scott: instead of a free PayPal account people send him five bucks.

323
00:21:26,547 --> 00:21:39,163
Scott: He could record You know a voiceover with a shitty microphone on the library computer and email it to them as a wav file with audacity or some shit and you can start a little tiny business from the library computer until he gets a laptop and then he Could work out of Starbucks.

324
00:21:39,906 --> 00:21:40,970
Rym: Where is he gonna record though?

325
00:21:41,452 --> 00:21:43,640
Scott: in the library in the Starbucks in the Starbucks?

326
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,054
Rym: So I'm sitting there drinking my latte and then next to me suddenly.

327
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:58,117
Scott: Hey, it's Tuesday Yeah, so He's a homeless guy You know, he'd be a dad be his job and eventually, you know, if he saved up he could get.

328
00:21:58,197 --> 00:21:59,080
Scott: he could get an apartment.

329
00:21:59,482 --> 00:22:00,828
Scott: I'm sure you know, it's Columbus, Ohio.

330
00:22:00,848 --> 00:22:01,571
Scott: It's not like New York.

331
00:22:01,892 --> 00:22:03,660
Scott: You could live in an apartment for pretty cheap.

332
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:05,440
Scott: I'm sure there's a place with low rents.

333
00:22:05,863 --> 00:22:13,517
Rym: I was gonna lean in to try to do the proper, you know Swallow the mic radio voice but my pop filters kind of in the way and then once he's that far easy He's looking pretty good.

334
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:15,627
Scott: So so go homeless.

335
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,490
Scott: guy with talents

336
00:22:16,771 --> 00:22:31,878
Rym: met a moment kind of important because it might disrupt Geeknight's one last time before we're back on our you know, normal schedule coming up not this weekend but next weekend, January 13 14 15 and 16th in Alexandria, Virginia, we will be at mag

337
00:22:31,938 --> 00:22:32,160
Scott: fest

338
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:36,616
Rym: The ninth mag fest doing nine panels.

339
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:41,410
Rym: now doing three panels We are doing losing should be fun, which is a panel.

340
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:41,831
Rym: We did it.

341
00:22:41,851 --> 00:22:44,300
Rym: a bunch of packs is slightly redone.

342
00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:45,553
Rym: We've updated it a little bit.

343
00:22:45,634 --> 00:22:46,139
Scott: It needs update.

344
00:22:46,361 --> 00:22:54,000
Rym: We might have an hour and a half instead of an hour Whoa, which means for the first time ever we could take questions that add Scott's rules of question asking.

345
00:22:54,481 --> 00:22:55,384
Rym: Ah, they're already in there.

346
00:22:55,525 --> 00:23:00,460
Rym: All right, and we are going to be on two panels with the mag nine nine gaming intellectuals.

347
00:23:01,143 --> 00:23:04,700
Rym: I'm not sure if they counted me and Scott as one mag nine or two.

348
00:23:06,064 --> 00:23:09,625
Rym: So there might be the mag ten For mag fest nine.

349
00:23:09,725 --> 00:23:09,966
Rym: I don't know.

350
00:23:10,007 --> 00:23:15,088
Scott: we're not on the mag fest website and they don't have a schedule up But we know what we're doing.

351
00:23:15,148 --> 00:23:15,851
Rym: Yes, there were.

352
00:23:15,891 --> 00:23:27,616
Rym: there are long email threads about this But suffice it to say we will also in addition to losing should be fun beyond Technical changes in game design and we'll be on achievements and meta gaming.

353
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:28,800
Scott: Oh, yeah, that one's gonna be.

354
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,607
Rym: I hope someone disagrees with me throw down.

355
00:23:30,727 --> 00:23:31,330
Rym: Oh my god.

356
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,016
Rym: I hope someone's like what's wrong with Zynga.

357
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:33,920
Rym: They make great games.

358
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:37,408
Rym: Anyway, the I don't think that'll happen.

359
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:40,099
Scott: Yeah mag fest, you know, it's I don't think my.

360
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:45,060
Scott: you know The other cons we go to right like even packs where I play try to play a lot of games.

361
00:23:45,422 --> 00:23:47,920
Scott: You know, the panels are still pretty significant at mag fest.

362
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:54,220
Scott: I'm feeling the panels less significant because it's four days of drunkenness in a hotel non-stop.

363
00:23:54,702 --> 00:23:59,139
Scott: I'm definitely feeling in concerts a lot more gaming concert activity.

364
00:24:00,361 --> 00:24:02,708
Rym: We have very few responsibilities at the con.

365
00:24:02,748 --> 00:24:03,651
Rym: I mean packs.

366
00:24:03,691 --> 00:24:05,998
Rym: we do a lot of stuff other than just our panels here.

367
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:09,245
Scott: Nothing Absolutely packs you also.

368
00:24:09,325 --> 00:24:14,762
Scott: it's like well you have to go to the opening whatever and you have to go to the closing and you Have to write.

369
00:24:15,144 --> 00:24:18,660
Scott: but at at mag fest is like what do I have to go to nothing?

370
00:24:19,403 --> 00:24:23,420
Rym: Also my own stuff the con unlike packs well both packs is which are right near home.

371
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,063
Rym: I go to lunch.

372
00:24:24,405 --> 00:24:25,953
Rym: I mean downtown Seattle pretty rockin.

373
00:24:25,974 --> 00:24:27,200
Rym: downtown Boston pretty rockin.

374
00:24:28,161 --> 00:24:32,580
Rym: There's nothing going on in Alexandria, Virginia by this hotel except mag fest.

375
00:24:33,162 --> 00:24:34,848
Rym: I should also warn people who are attending.

376
00:24:34,888 --> 00:24:40,070
Rym: if you are not aware parking at mag fest sucks balls According to other people.

377
00:24:40,151 --> 00:24:41,159
Scott: I we don't know for sure.

378
00:24:42,802 --> 00:24:45,600
Rym: Best website itself says hey our parking sucks.

379
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:47,607
Scott: I believe you basically cannot park here.

380
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:48,952
Rym: figure something out.

381
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:49,976
Rym: Try not to drive.

382
00:24:50,377 --> 00:24:50,819
Scott: I believe it.

383
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:53,226
Rym: So, uh, look at the website.

384
00:24:53,246 --> 00:24:57,800
Rym: They have a bunch of helpful hints, which basically boil down to don't park in the fire lane.

385
00:24:57,881 --> 00:24:59,859
Rym: They towed like 12 dozen cars last year.

386
00:25:00,403 --> 00:25:02,639
Rym: Don't park out on the street where they will tell you.

387
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:04,788
Rym: Don't park at the stores where they were told you.

388
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:07,539
Rym: don't park in front of the apartments across the street where they will tell you.

389
00:25:09,304 --> 00:25:12,989
Rym: Also this weekend You can go even if you're going to mag fest.

390
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,500
Rym: on Friday is another nerd NYC game night.

391
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,009
Rym: I think coffee downtown willing to it will be.

392
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:24,040
Scott: the best weekend is a recess double recess Yes, and Sunday in New York City all gaming.

393
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:29,118
Rym: So if you are not going to mag fest because you are a sad loser, or maybe you can't get there.

394
00:25:29,158 --> 00:25:39,429
Rym: I mean Then you can go to the recess which is basically two days of concentrated gaming And if you don't know what the nerd NYC gaming stuff is like this weekend on Friday You can go to their normal thing.

395
00:25:39,449 --> 00:25:46,460
Rym: And if you don't live in New York well Loser one other meta item is you know our forum, right?

396
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,443
Scott: You know the way it works.

397
00:25:47,483 --> 00:25:50,755
Scott: is you apply for you know to be registered and then we approve?

398
00:25:50,996 --> 00:25:52,160
Rym: I've denied a bunch of people.

399
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,223
Scott: Yes, we have.

400
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:57,237
Scott: you know, we were originally approving anyone who typed any English.

401
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:00,306
Scott: now There is a section on the application.

402
00:26:00,346 --> 00:26:03,074
Scott: pretty much you enter and you know username email address.

403
00:26:03,235 --> 00:26:04,719
Scott: It's it's almost nothing right?

404
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:05,981
Scott: Password.

405
00:26:06,302 --> 00:26:14,210
Scott: but there is one box where it says tell us why you want to join and a lot of people would type something in There like I want to discuss the podcast.

406
00:26:14,732 --> 00:26:16,520
Scott: Well, that's you know, that's a complete sentence.

407
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:18,100
Scott: So I would you know, I could go for that.

408
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:22,832
Scott: I could approve that but a lot of people would write things like Discussion and I'm like up from now on.

409
00:26:22,912 --> 00:26:24,360
Scott: I used to approve something like that.

410
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,279
Scott: You know what bothers me is and give them the benefit of the doubt and then reject them once they started spamming.

411
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:32,760
Rym: the time When I do I get someone who's like discussion or a penis or something.

412
00:26:33,282 --> 00:26:35,870
Rym: They're a real person but half the time now they're a spam bot.

413
00:26:36,312 --> 00:26:46,040
Scott: so basically when you type into that box Write something that proves you're not a spam should update the text to say basically type something to prove that you are human.

414
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:56,915
Scott: Yeah It's like write a complete sentence or write something that proves that you're a listener of the podcast Like I want to talk about last episode or something, you know That's not just a word like.

415
00:26:57,016 --> 00:27:00,260
Scott: hey Cuz I'm just gonna reject that because there's been some spamming.

416
00:27:00,381 --> 00:27:05,367
Rym: You just have to prove to us that you were human and if you got rejected at all You basically could.

417
00:27:05,728 --> 00:27:07,880
Rym: you did not prove to me that you were actually human.

418
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:13,539
Scott: Yeah, if you're a human and you got rejected apply again and just type something more significant in that box.

419
00:27:13,941 --> 00:27:18,279
Scott: Now if you type something more significant, I don't want to use a capture because someone could break a capture.

420
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:21,940
Scott: this I'm the judge of it, you know as opposed to the capture being the judge of it.

421
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,795
Rym: Yeah, I can approve or disprove a couple hundred of these a day if I need to.

422
00:27:25,856 --> 00:27:31,595
Scott: it scales pretty well Yeah, and if we're getting so many we can't handle it approving and disproving.

423
00:27:31,615 --> 00:27:33,277
Rym: I think at that point we'll be able to hire a moderate.

424
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:36,287
Scott: That means we're so popular that we're doing pretty good.

425
00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:49,401
Rym: So Super Meat Boy SMB Super Mario Brothers Homage perhaps perhaps not really kind of if they call them Super Meat Boy 3.

426
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:57,072
Rym: I would have agreed because Mario 3 is pretty much one of the most tightest most rock-solid Platform 2d platformers the world has ever seen.

427
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:57,836
Rym: Mm-hmm.

428
00:27:58,157 --> 00:27:58,519
Scott: Indeed.

429
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,885
Scott: It is No, I'm a super meat boy, right?

430
00:28:00,925 --> 00:28:04,860
Scott: I first actually saw the game being played at PAX West, right?

431
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,225
Scott: It was part of the PAX 10.

432
00:28:06,225 --> 00:28:09,298
Rym: I believe yeah, I was pretty goddamn indifferent to it.

433
00:28:09,318 --> 00:28:12,080
Scott: to be honest Yeah, I don't know what I saw being played there.

434
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:21,135
Scott: I basically what I saw was a guy who was doing wall jumps, right and he had to be just so precise So as not to die and everyone was like, oh, oh and I'm sitting there watching thinking.

435
00:28:21,556 --> 00:28:22,620
Scott: Oh man, I could totally do it.

436
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,623
Scott: No, I would fail.

437
00:28:23,764 --> 00:28:28,719
Scott: also right it's like is everyone there was you know had the platforming skills and everyone would.

438
00:28:28,739 --> 00:28:37,788
Scott: you know You'd fail a whole bunch until you eventually hit it just right and that's the super meat boy is it's a. it's a platforming game And it's not a puzzle platformer, right?

439
00:28:37,808 --> 00:28:41,740
Rym: You know, there are some nominal puzzles like figure like later in hell.

440
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:46,340
Rym: There'll be a whole bunch of portals and it's kind of a. can you figure out the way through followed by?

441
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,319
Rym: Can you actually do it now that you figured it out?

442
00:28:48,982 --> 00:28:50,767
Scott: Yeah, I mean but there's not that much figuring.

443
00:28:50,868 --> 00:28:50,988
Scott: I'm.

444
00:28:51,068 --> 00:28:56,568
Scott: puzzle platformers are usually more along the lines of okay You know, there's a block puzzle.

445
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,780
Rym: pick up the block run with it drop it somewhere.

446
00:28:58,961 --> 00:29:01,669
Scott: Yeah, that kind of stuff this is or you know, like braid.

447
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,495
Scott: braid is a puzzle platformer, right?

448
00:29:03,656 --> 00:29:04,077
Scott: It's not.

449
00:29:04,158 --> 00:29:04,840
Scott: can you jump?

450
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,258
Scott: It's can you figure out?

451
00:29:07,382 --> 00:29:11,219
Rym: One definition of puzzle is just whether or not it's trivial to solve or not.

452
00:29:12,022 --> 00:29:16,760
Rym: I mean if you're an intelligent person, I mean technically any single-player game is a puzzle, right?

453
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,853
Rym: I mean if you're playing tic-tac-toe against an AI and you're not that bright.

454
00:29:19,953 --> 00:29:20,516
Rym: It's a puzzle.

455
00:29:21,018 --> 00:29:21,460
Scott: That's true.

456
00:29:22,701 --> 00:29:23,906
Scott: But you know Mario vs.

457
00:29:23,946 --> 00:29:27,400
Scott: Donkey Kong that is like the truth, you know, that's for me is like the classic.

458
00:29:27,521 --> 00:29:29,360
Scott: What is a puzzle platformer that is a puzzle?

459
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,884
Rym: The thing with meat boy is that it?

460
00:29:31,185 --> 00:29:31,265
Rym: it?

461
00:29:31,526 --> 00:29:36,119
Rym: there are many of this so-called the genre of ultra hard precision platformers.

462
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:39,411
Scott: And yeah, there's like n-plus meat boy.

463
00:29:39,451 --> 00:29:41,398
Scott: I want to be the guy is my favorite.

464
00:29:41,478 --> 00:29:41,900
Rym: of all these.

465
00:29:42,042 --> 00:29:43,459
Rym: I think they're all legitimate games.

466
00:29:44,502 --> 00:29:56,749
Scott: Meat boy is the only one that is both harsh and fair Simultaneously that is you know, if you watch angry video game nerd you will see pretty much all of these incredibly old games that you know frustrate the angry video game nerd and make him so angry.

467
00:29:56,769 --> 00:30:03,350
Scott: and the reason they make him so angry is because the design of These games is either you know is unfair or just broken.

468
00:30:03,431 --> 00:30:06,940
Scott: right, you know, there'll be games where you die in one hit.

469
00:30:07,161 --> 00:30:09,935
Scott: Okay, that could be fair, but you didn't get hit.

470
00:30:09,995 --> 00:30:13,531
Scott: if you actually look at the pixels You did not get hit but it the game register to hit.

471
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:15,600
Scott: or there'll be games where?

472
00:30:16,462 --> 00:30:24,380
Scott: You know, you'll have to make some ridiculous jump But the ridiculous jump is actually like one pixel too far or Ninja Turtles, right?

473
00:30:24,661 --> 00:30:31,833
Scott: you know you try to make this jump but you fall through and You can actually walk across but it's not obvious that you can walk across.

474
00:30:31,854 --> 00:30:33,440
Scott: the design of the game is busted.

475
00:30:33,842 --> 00:30:35,107
Scott: It's that you're not totally sure.

476
00:30:35,328 --> 00:30:36,593
Scott: you know that this is possible.

477
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:41,885
Rym: I'm pretty sure that was intentional possibly but Super Meat Boy right.

478
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:49,020
Scott: basically while it is hard as balls and while you will die a billion times It is 100% fair and perfectly designed, you know.

479
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,560
Scott: The first thing they did that was a work that was genius is they made the main character meat boy a square, right?

480
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,303
Scott: Because he's a square.

481
00:30:56,324 --> 00:31:01,264
Scott: the game has absolutely perfect collision detection right to the pixel Right.

482
00:31:01,505 --> 00:31:07,176
Scott: if meat boy touches a chainsaw blade, you know It detects perfectly whether that one pixel of chainsaw hit him.

483
00:31:07,237 --> 00:31:09,847
Scott: and then he dies Instantly and you instantly retry.

484
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:11,512
Scott: you have to wait and you know to go.

485
00:31:11,633 --> 00:31:12,415
Scott: it's just okay.

486
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:13,780
Scott: retry instant, right?

487
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,983
Scott: No frustrating waiting.

488
00:31:15,364 --> 00:31:16,127
Scott: No suffering.

489
00:31:16,388 --> 00:31:20,340
Rym: Just go at it again, but at the same time no waypoints.

490
00:31:20,481 --> 00:31:23,478
Rym: So you still have to beat the level in a whole go?

491
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:31,039
Rym: But every level is kind of broken up in almost two parts and like you'll get past the first part and then you have to Deal with the second part you'll die a lot there.

492
00:31:31,562 --> 00:31:37,263
Rym: but watching people play it's cool to see the the growth of mastery very quickly where a player will be Like.

493
00:31:37,484 --> 00:31:43,960
Rym: they'll struggle with the first half and then they'll be able to do the first half without dying Trivially in the course of solving the second half.

494
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:52,927
Rym: It's kind of like all the old 90s NES games the experience of playing Mario 1 all the way through all the way through all the way through Compressed into an individual level.

495
00:31:53,128 --> 00:31:56,300
Scott: Yeah, and this is what I like is, you know too many games nowadays, right?

496
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,986
Scott: they basically let you save all the time or You know, you're basically constant.

497
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:04,219
Scott: You never have to redo anything and there's no punishment for dying, right?

498
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:10,709
Rym: granted I don't want to go back to the old days where I would die at the end of ninja Gayden and have to start at the beginning of ninja gay.

499
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:11,291
Scott: fuck that.

500
00:32:11,692 --> 00:32:13,800
Scott: but you know super meat boy is the exact right balance.

501
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,424
Scott: you Die, it was fair.

502
00:32:15,645 --> 00:32:17,771
Scott: It didn't cheat you out of you know, it didn't?

503
00:32:17,872 --> 00:32:20,680
Scott: you know, Rob you the design wasn't misleading.

504
00:32:21,102 --> 00:32:21,664
Scott: You died.

505
00:32:21,744 --> 00:32:23,189
Scott: fair and square right?

506
00:32:23,209 --> 00:32:26,100
Scott: There is a fair and square way to beat every level, right?

507
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,405
Scott: You just didn't do it now.

508
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,530
Scott: So now you're gonna do this.

509
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,654
Scott: we save you know.

510
00:32:29,694 --> 00:32:30,578
Scott: last level you beat.

511
00:32:30,678 --> 00:32:31,020
Scott: it's cool.

512
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:38,780
Scott: Just do this level again and as a result your skill your the human skill you actually improve not some stat improving.

513
00:32:39,221 --> 00:32:39,904
Scott: You improve.

514
00:32:39,964 --> 00:32:47,553
Rym: now granted the cheap death is a good mechanic mostly for humor like those games like I want to be the guy I don't enjoy playing them, but I understand why people would.

515
00:32:47,574 --> 00:32:51,648
Rym: that is a human game Watching other people play those games.

516
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:55,860
Rym: I love nothing more than seeing Mario hit the hidden coin block and fall into the pit.

517
00:32:56,081 --> 00:32:58,068
Rym: Yep, but that'll never get old to me.

518
00:32:58,249 --> 00:32:59,835
Scott: Yeah, but it's not fair.

519
00:32:59,956 --> 00:33:01,040
Scott: nor is it good, right?

520
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:06,585
Scott: but super meat boy is way hard perhaps even harder than those games and Perfectly fair.

521
00:33:06,605 --> 00:33:07,673
Rym: I'll argue those games are good.

522
00:33:07,693 --> 00:33:08,660
Rym: They're just a different kind of game.

523
00:33:08,882 --> 00:33:10,759
Rym: I don't like them and I can argue why I don't like them.

524
00:33:11,021 --> 00:33:14,420
Scott: The other thing is that those games are often games of memory, right?

525
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:22,580
Scott: You have to memorize the way to get through the level much like Ikaruga Yes, whereas super meat boy is not a game of memory, right?

526
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:26,859
Scott: You can easily, you know see the way through the level at least most of the time, right?

527
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,849
Scott: Because there's usually you know, only one way to go.

528
00:33:30,371 --> 00:33:32,520
Rym: So it's those goddamn laser eyes.

529
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:33,767
Scott: So 90% 99% of the game is execution, right?

530
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,860
Scott: Can you execute the path that you see before you you know?

531
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:43,907
Scott: And if you're gonna if you keep trying and stick to it You will be able to.

532
00:33:43,968 --> 00:33:46,380
Scott: unless you're an old man with like a palsy, right?

533
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:52,948
Scott: You will succeed at getting through it eventually and even though the game gets harder You will improve and beat it.

534
00:33:53,309 --> 00:33:56,660
Rym: I want to talk about the replay system because that is a stroke of brilliance.

535
00:33:57,001 --> 00:34:02,138
Rym: I played games like this before but when I got to a really frustrating level, I'd play it for like 10-15 minutes.

536
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:08,920
Rym: You'll retry like a hundred times and then I would get to the point of fuck this and turn the game off with meat boy.

537
00:34:09,482 --> 00:34:11,993
Rym: I want to see my dead meats.

538
00:34:12,114 --> 00:34:14,161
Rym: I want to see the thousand times I failed.

539
00:34:14,222 --> 00:34:22,245
Rym: so the longer you try and fail at one the more you want to not give up in this Current session until you beat it.

540
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:30,748
Scott: Yep, because then what happens is as soon as you beat the level it shows you every single Playthrough of the level you just played simultaneously.

541
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:33,938
Rym: So it's kind of like all the meat boys converge on the optimal solution.

542
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,987
Scott: Yep It's it's.

543
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,862
Scott: it's quite a thing It's so it just.

544
00:34:38,103 --> 00:34:43,239
Rym: it's surprisingly satisfying and I really think it is the only reason a lot of people continue to play super meat boy.

545
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:53,460
Rym: perhaps if you beat one level and then you play the next one and it's like the number of deaths you have experienced is An inverse relationship to the likelihood you will stop before you beat that level.

546
00:34:53,681 --> 00:35:02,540
Scott: The other thing I really like about this game is you look at a lot of other indie games lately and they're actually kind of Short, right like Machinarium with the fact was not a significant game, right?

547
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,482
Scott: But super meat boy.

548
00:35:03,984 --> 00:35:08,237
Scott: at times this game has been like two dollars and change on Steam at times, right?

549
00:35:08,738 --> 00:35:11,780
Scott: But meanwhile The game is really long.

550
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,674
Scott: It has a significant number of levels in a significant size.

551
00:35:15,935 --> 00:35:17,240
Scott: and on top of that, right?

552
00:35:17,601 --> 00:35:28,531
Scott: There are many many warp zones with additional levels to play and characters and a whole bunch of characters to play with and You can always replay a level to try to get the bandage.

553
00:35:28,612 --> 00:35:30,640
Scott: if you didn't get the bandage fuck those bandages.

554
00:35:30,981 --> 00:35:41,690
Scott: And if you didn't get an a-plus on the level by beating it fast enough You can replay it to get an a-plus and as soon as you get an a-plus on a level you can you can then play That level in Dark World mode, which is even harder.

555
00:35:42,172 --> 00:35:48,638
Scott: So the game is just this incredible Amount of replay value that That you know is available to you.

556
00:35:49,101 --> 00:35:50,365
Rym: So how do you orient yourself?

557
00:35:50,405 --> 00:35:54,500
Rym: because I use my left thumb on the analog stick and I use the right trigger to run.

558
00:35:55,103 --> 00:35:57,820
Scott: I've been used in switching between d-pad and analog stick.

559
00:35:58,061 --> 00:36:04,584
Rym: I use the d-pad on when I'm if ever I'm walking like it's a precision thing where I'm actually walking and I've let go of Run always d-pad.

560
00:36:04,885 --> 00:36:10,241
Rym: Mm-hmm, but the rest of the time I use the stick and I just it feels more I Don't.

561
00:36:10,261 --> 00:36:11,930
Rym: I throw it back and forth pretty hard.

562
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,840
Scott: The thing is I wish that there was more.

563
00:36:14,524 --> 00:36:21,983
Scott: If you know if I had the better d-pad than that one I'd probably use it all the time just because I'm a d-pad kind of guy, but it doesn't really matter I can switch it off.

564
00:36:22,465 --> 00:36:27,667
Scott: and as for the you know, I used to just be holding down the you know The X button to go fast.

565
00:36:27,747 --> 00:36:29,999
Rym: Well, you're used to playing a Mario game where you're always holding B.

566
00:36:30,381 --> 00:36:35,680
Scott: Yeah, right, but I just you know, I've only found out that you could hold the right trigger to go fast.

567
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,087
Scott: You know and people were talking about it.

568
00:36:38,127 --> 00:36:42,418
Scott: So now I'm experimenting with that, but I still think you know Just used to holding down.

569
00:36:42,761 --> 00:36:53,540
Rym: You know the trigger is better for me cuz it free kind of like when I you play FPS as I have walk forward as My right mouse button, which is good in some FPS is but in other FPS is it kind of loads down my mouse hand when?

570
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,923
Rym: I'm aiming Mm-hmm.

571
00:36:55,825 --> 00:36:57,350
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot going on there.

572
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:00,541
Rym: Oh, I also enjoy all the weird kind of Easter eggs Like.

573
00:37:00,561 --> 00:37:01,463
Rym: the cutscenes are good.

574
00:37:01,564 --> 00:37:02,045
Rym: They're short.

575
00:37:02,146 --> 00:37:05,396
Rym: They're they're nice homage to old games like Castlevania Ninja.

576
00:37:05,416 --> 00:37:10,899
Rym: Hey, then And the the - worlds that apparently you haven't found yet.

577
00:37:11,643 --> 00:37:14,819
Scott: Well, the - world apparently is is a completely random thing, right?

578
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:28,473
Scott: Sometimes just randomly when a level loads a meat girl Right is is all glitched out and if you touch her if you actually win on that exact moment and touch her You will go to the - world which had never been to -

579
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:30,120
Rym: world's fun, but you only get three lives.

580
00:37:30,241 --> 00:37:31,957
Rym: I've never beaten my hate that.

581
00:37:32,058 --> 00:37:39,555
Scott: you know Some of the warp zones with the ones of the weird characters you can keep trying and I like those but the ones Where you're pixelated meat boy, and you only have three lives.

582
00:37:39,736 --> 00:37:41,566
Scott: Ah, fuck those I can't beat.

583
00:37:41,647 --> 00:37:44,000
Scott: like, you know, like some of those like I definitely could beat them.

584
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,318
Scott: Well, the trouble had infinite lives, you know.

585
00:37:46,701 --> 00:37:50,628
Rym: That's the thing that you get the old 8-bit experience But in limited doses.

586
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:53,200
Rym: you can still have that because I like the limited lives.

587
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:01,185
Rym: it reminds me that I am relying on the crush of meat boy dies a thousand goddamn times because I Throw caution to the wind.

588
00:38:01,305 --> 00:38:05,680
Rym: I've got two thousand some deaths and I'm only about most of the way through hell.

589
00:38:06,101 --> 00:38:12,164
Scott: The other thing I really like about the game right is that you know a lot of games, you know, for example Borderlands, right?

590
00:38:12,204 --> 00:38:14,895
Scott: These are games that blow their load early right, you know.

591
00:38:15,236 --> 00:38:17,799
Scott: at the beginning of the game They'll have a whole bunch of interesting stuff.

592
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:23,028
Scott: They'll keep introducing you to and then once you get to the middle of the game They basically stretch the game out.

593
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,660
Rym: a castle crashers a castle crashers, right?

594
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:29,634
Scott: They'll stretch the game out with a whole bunch of regular stuff.

595
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:30,538
Scott: right castle crashers.

596
00:38:30,618 --> 00:38:34,360
Scott: early in the game There's a whole bunch of exciting stuff gladiator fights, you know.

597
00:38:34,681 --> 00:38:37,715
Scott: And then there's the level where you had to run away on when you're riding on the.

598
00:38:37,956 --> 00:38:43,220
Rym: the animal also Just the design the music the sets and it all kind of gets standing after a few levels.

599
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:57,360
Scott: It's basically walk down the street and beat guys up in the snow walk down the street beat guys up in the desert walk down You know, it's like they stop making special stuff after a certain point, you know meat boy keeps it fresh even in later levels.

600
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:03,880
Scott: They're introducing new elements like the glowing pulsating bouncy things and then the the homing guns and then lasers.

601
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:10,620
Rym: And then, you know different ways to use the key holes for demon heads come out and then explode into six additional.

602
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:10,962
Scott: Do you know?

603
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:13,880
Scott: conveyor belts to go up and shoot you up into the sky?

604
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:22,620
Scott: The monster that sort of floats after you slowly like a beholder even though it has a lot more to two more eyes You know, but no eye stalks, you know.

605
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:28,266
Scott: They keep introducing new stuff and keeping it fresh and even though there's a lot of levels They were all.

606
00:39:28,386 --> 00:39:31,300
Scott: it seems like they put the full effort into designing each level.

607
00:39:31,481 --> 00:39:31,943
Scott: Wasn't like?

608
00:39:32,023 --> 00:39:33,088
Rym: I can name it was not like.

609
00:39:33,108 --> 00:39:38,818
Scott: there's some levels where that are designed Well and some levels that they just sort of did off the cuff right.

610
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:44,815
Scott: remember It's like Mario 3 or Mario 3 where they put the full design effort into every level.

611
00:39:44,895 --> 00:39:48,548
Rym: the sky world that had both a bottom Part a tower and a top part.

612
00:39:48,608 --> 00:39:49,251
Scott: That's the best guy.

613
00:39:49,312 --> 00:39:49,814
Rym: I have some goods.

614
00:39:49,975 --> 00:39:50,356
Rym: I don't know.

615
00:39:50,397 --> 00:39:51,120
Rym: sky world was good.

616
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,720
Rym: It's a very big shoe, but giant world was also pretty damn fine.

617
00:39:54,740 --> 00:40:00,800
Scott: Yeah, they put the full design effort into every level and there's a lot of levels, you know And they didn't skimp out on anything.

618
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,980
Scott: So you actually want to keep going and keep going and there's a tiny plot to go with it.

619
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,127
Scott: That is some tiny humors.

620
00:40:06,207 --> 00:40:07,696
Scott: that is, you know, also worthwhile.

621
00:40:07,797 --> 00:40:10,519
Rym: I will admit though I love the game and I'm going to beat it for sure.

622
00:40:10,681 --> 00:40:12,934
Scott: I'm definitely gonna beat it but I can only do like two levels a day.

623
00:40:12,974 --> 00:40:18,971
Rym: when I say beating it I mean, I'm gonna beat the whole game normal and I'm gonna beat the whole game dark and Maybe the whole game doc.

624
00:40:18,991 --> 00:40:23,940
Rym: I'm gonna go for it But I'm not gonna go after a hundred percent bandages or a hundred percent unlocks or any of that.

625
00:40:24,101 --> 00:40:27,220
Scott: I don't go for a hundred percent and pretty much any any games, right?

626
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:32,120
Rym: The only game I have done in the last like decade a hundred percent was advanced Wars.

627
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:37,500
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, I mean just I could do we should do a show about going a hundred percent in games.

628
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,132
Scott: But I mean, it seems like a lot of games these days.

629
00:40:40,213 --> 00:40:44,289
Scott: what they'll do is they'll make a game You know and it's like you've seen every level.

630
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:47,480
Scott: you've got to the end boss you beat him, right?

631
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,920
Scott: But now this get like Mario 64 is like it's like okay you've beaten Mario 64. you went to every level.

632
00:40:54,441 --> 00:40:55,686
Scott: You got at least one star.

633
00:40:55,726 --> 00:40:56,388
Scott: in every level.

634
00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:10,061
Scott: you beat King Koopa, but if you get all 120 stars Then you can you know, then you'll really beat it, but it's like You know all that process of getting the those hundred and twenty stars is not, you know It's.

635
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:12,489
Scott: it's more tedium than where is the before.

636
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:15,940
Scott: that point just beating the game feels like there was more substance to it.

637
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:24,885
Rym: Of course Super Meat Boy bothers me in one regard and a lot of games do this Remember like when Mario 2 was re-released on the DS or the Game Boy Advance or whatever Yep, and it was.

638
00:41:25,187 --> 00:41:27,300
Rym: it was way easy like they gimped the hell out of it.

639
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:30,933
Rym: Yeah, but then they added those stupid Yoshi eggs.

640
00:41:30,953 --> 00:41:32,218
Rym: You had to find the Yoshi eggs.

641
00:41:32,238 --> 00:41:32,880
Rym: They're hidden everywhere.

642
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,725
Rym: It's basically impossible without a fact.

643
00:41:34,946 --> 00:41:37,894
Rym: Yep, if you get them all you get jack and shit.

644
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:43,091
Rym: Yep, Super Meat Boy Rewards you with stuff playable characters.

645
00:41:43,232 --> 00:41:45,640
Scott: Yeah, but I mean unlocking I don't you know, I'm not a fan.

646
00:41:46,043 --> 00:41:47,493
Rym: No, I hate unlocking.

647
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:48,379
Rym: That's the thing.

648
00:41:48,741 --> 00:41:53,500
Rym: My problem is that I'm not gonna hundred percent it and as a result, I'm not gonna get these characters.

649
00:41:53,841 --> 00:41:54,264
Scott: They're neat.

650
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:57,580
Scott: The thing is I have high hopes that there's gonna be an editor for the PC version.

651
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,280
Scott: We're just gonna let people make their own levels, which is gonna be real good.

652
00:42:00,681 --> 00:42:04,857
Scott: I foresee a lot of good stuff coming out of that that I'll probably play and get into that maybe a little bit.

653
00:42:05,158 --> 00:42:05,700
Scott: cuz modding.

654
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,493
Scott: That will be a lot easier than modding say, you know, anything else is 2d.

655
00:42:10,155 --> 00:42:22,520
Scott: and on top of that I have some high hopes that somebody will just make a hack or you just download a save file and then you have 100% on the PC and then you can play whatever parts that you didn't unlock that you wanted to check out.

656
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,845
Scott: You know try out all the characters once Separate show on unlocking.

657
00:42:26,885 --> 00:42:29,434
Rym: cuz I I'm done with unlocking as a mechanic.

658
00:42:29,654 --> 00:42:30,537
Scott: Yeah, it's bullshit.

659
00:42:30,597 --> 00:42:30,798
Scott: It can

660
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:31,179
Rym: be there

661
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:49,412
Scott: But like I just beats I just beat Mario Galaxy 2 and then after you beat it It unlocks this extra world and it's like I started playing through the extra world because they're actually full levels in there like a rainbow Road and all this stuff and I was like, ooh, I actually want to play all these things and you know It's like okay get five more stars and then you can play this world.

662
00:42:49,473 --> 00:42:51,582
Scott: Okay, you have five more stars You can play this world.

663
00:42:51,643 --> 00:42:53,590
Scott: Okay get ten more and you can play this world.

664
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:56,120
Scott: Okay get ten more to put fuck you.

665
00:42:56,803 --> 00:42:58,713
Scott: Yeah, there's only like two or three worlds left.

666
00:42:58,753 --> 00:43:04,175
Rym: I haven't gotten to but it's And I see multiple characters that require more than 50.

667
00:43:04,175 --> 00:43:04,637
Rym: Fuck you.

668
00:43:04,657 --> 00:43:08,453
Scott: Yeah Well, I think the minecraft guy requires the most right cuz he can just cheat.

669
00:43:08,493 --> 00:43:10,140
Scott: he can just like edit the levels.

670
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:11,745
Scott: You can just make.

671
00:43:11,765 --> 00:43:14,200
Rym: I do like that how the meat boy is the real game.

672
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,420
Rym: But yet the other characters are just the weird fun stuff.

673
00:43:23,842 --> 00:43:26,089
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
