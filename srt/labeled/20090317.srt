1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,327
Rym: It's Tuesday, March 17th.

2
00:00:11,347 --> 00:00:11,989
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:12,592
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,672 --> 00:00:13,877
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:13,897 --> 00:00:16,181
Rym: Tonight we talk about four swords on the GameCube.

6
00:00:25,866 --> 00:00:26,946
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:34,575
Scott: So, you know, I used to, I'm not Irish, Rym, you're not Irish at all, are you?

8
00:00:34,615 --> 00:00:35,459
Scott: Faith in Bagora!

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,503
Scott: No, you're not.

10
00:00:36,966 --> 00:00:37,568
Scott: But, you know, St.

11
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,649
Scott: Patrick's Day was always just sort of like this fun sort of nothing holiday.

12
00:00:41,669 --> 00:00:44,698
Scott: You know, I didn't really care about it either way, but it was sort of fun.

13
00:00:44,738 --> 00:00:55,234
Scott: Like, you know, the leprechaun and, you know, it's sort of, you know, you get some lucky charms and all that, you know, it's all right.

14
00:00:55,254 --> 00:01:00,554
Rym: Well, I remember when I was a kid, it was my favorite non-Christmas, non-birthday holiday.

15
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:01,398
Scott: Oh, really?

16
00:01:01,438 --> 00:01:01,960
Scott: Wow.

17
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:04,048
Scott: I've never had strong feelings about it.

18
00:01:04,168 --> 00:01:07,742
Rym: It speaks of my ego when I think about it that I called my birthday a holiday.

19
00:01:07,762 --> 00:01:10,774
Rym: But, I remember as a kid, St.

20
00:01:10,794 --> 00:01:18,332
Rym: Patrick's Day was the best day in the world because one, in preschool, we had, there was one area of the preschool that had this giant tank of water and all these pumps and stuff.

21
00:01:18,934 --> 00:01:20,398
Rym: They dyed the water green.

22
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:24,890
Rym: And two, I liked green a lot when I was a kid.

23
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:25,374
Scott: I also liked green.

24
00:01:25,394 --> 00:01:26,562
Scott: So it was the green holiday.

25
00:01:26,582 --> 00:01:29,217
Scott: Even though I liked green, I didn't like it enough to care about the holiday.

26
00:01:29,338 --> 00:01:32,734
Rym: I would wear like green sweatpants and a green sweater on St.

27
00:01:32,774 --> 00:01:33,337
Rym: Patrick's Day.

28
00:01:33,417 --> 00:01:33,719
Rym: Anyway.

29
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:34,623
Rym: When I was like six.

30
00:01:35,064 --> 00:01:37,917
Scott: But in recent years, I have come to dislike St.

31
00:01:37,957 --> 00:01:38,580
Scott: Patrick's Day.

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:45,713
Scott: And the reason for that, well, it's not that much that I dislike the holiday is that I dread the holiday because what happens is there are two things.

33
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:49,830
Scott: Number one, in Beacon, the town in which we live, there is a pub crawl.

34
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,696
Scott: A pub crawl is cool if you like.

35
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:56,495
Rym: I believe last year the pub crawl was, we were recording the show when it was going on.

36
00:01:56,877 --> 00:01:57,098
Scott: Yeah.

37
00:01:57,158 --> 00:02:01,858
Scott: And basically what, if you don't know, these people walk around town getting drunk.

38
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,277
Rym: Now you might think it couldn't be that big of a deal in Beacon, but Beacon's a city.

39
00:02:06,317 --> 00:02:07,182
Rym: There's a lot of people here.

40
00:02:07,202 --> 00:02:10,678
Rym: And two, the pub crawl has been going on forever.

41
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:14,411
Scott: When the pub crawl happens, I think they said there were like a few thousand people.

42
00:02:14,472 --> 00:02:18,105
Scott: It's just everyone from all the surrounding towns comes in.

43
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:19,892
Scott: You know, it's not just the Beacon people.

44
00:02:19,993 --> 00:02:21,722
Rym: It's this long old tradition.

45
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:30,445
Rym: Like the Beacon pub crawl has been going on forever and they'll gather at one part, like on the edge of town, which, and we live kind of on the edge of town and they'll all walk past our house.

46
00:02:30,465 --> 00:02:32,034
Scott: Yeah, we live right near some pubs too.

47
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,923
Scott: There's like two across the street from each other.

48
00:02:34,245 --> 00:02:36,133
Scott: And then there's a long road without any pubs.

49
00:02:36,193 --> 00:02:40,932
Rym: Oh, speaking of which, speaking of which, that bar down the street is for sale, right?

50
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:42,699
Scott: Which bar for sale?

51
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:46,553
Rym: The white one on the left, right down, like right across in the Barking Frog.

52
00:02:46,594 --> 00:02:46,895
Scott: Yes.

53
00:02:46,995 --> 00:02:48,421
Rym: OK, so I looked into it.

54
00:02:48,782 --> 00:02:49,886
Rym: It's not that expensive.

55
00:02:50,027 --> 00:02:53,464
Rym: And it's dual use residential commercial because there's an apartment in it upstairs.

56
00:02:53,745 --> 00:02:54,911
Scott: You want to live in the bar?

57
00:02:55,553 --> 00:02:57,199
Rym: It's not more expensive than a house.

58
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,394
Rym: I could just use the bar as the most awesome party room ever.

59
00:03:01,535 --> 00:03:03,723
Scott: I thought you would actually want to run the bar.

60
00:03:03,743 --> 00:03:07,979
Rym: No, I would just stock the bar and have my own private bar.

61
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:10,026
Scott: I thought you wanted to run the bar to get money.

62
00:03:10,046 --> 00:03:11,633
Rym: No, no, because I don't want to.

63
00:03:11,794 --> 00:03:15,715
Rym: I don't want to deal with having the commercial property to be used for commercial business anyway.

64
00:03:16,918 --> 00:03:20,048
Scott: So also on this today is actually St.

65
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:22,256
Scott: Patrick's Day, which means that there's a St.

66
00:03:22,297 --> 00:03:25,651
Scott: Patrick's Day parade in the city, which is cool because parades are awesome.

67
00:03:25,712 --> 00:03:30,510
Scott: And it's it's got some of my favorite things in that parade, like pipes and drums.

68
00:03:31,132 --> 00:03:35,588
Rym: Now, luckily, I get up in the morning early enough to not have to deal with this.

69
00:03:35,628 --> 00:03:37,876
Rym: So my morning train, like I forgot it was St.

70
00:03:37,897 --> 00:03:38,479
Rym: Patty's Day.

71
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,001
Scott: Yep.

72
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:39,824
Rym: I went to work.

73
00:03:39,864 --> 00:03:46,345
Scott: I'm like, oh, if you take most of the trains, most of the trains you take today on St.

74
00:03:46,386 --> 00:03:49,959
Scott: Patrick's Day are full of people going to the parade, which is fine.

75
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,947
Scott: You know, you know, parade people on the train.

76
00:03:51,987 --> 00:03:53,835
Scott: Big deal just means there's a few less seats.

77
00:03:53,975 --> 00:03:54,778
Scott: No, no problem.

78
00:03:54,858 --> 00:03:55,441
Scott: I get a seat.

79
00:03:55,621 --> 00:03:57,809
Scott: You know, the thing is the St.

80
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:04,993
Scott: Patrick's Day parade, most of the people going to it are drunken and stupid high school and college kids.

81
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:07,402
Scott: And they they can't wait to get to the parade.

82
00:04:07,463 --> 00:04:14,247
Scott: So as a result, they get drunk and go, woo, which I, you know, I dealt with that in college, living in colony.

83
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,090
Scott: It was no problem.

84
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,716
Rym: In fact, I would say is entertaining.

85
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:21,940
Rym: I would say that the pub crawl every year when it happens, while I'm annoyed because there's drunks everywhere.

86
00:04:21,982 --> 00:04:28,207
Rym: And of course, at the end of the night, every year, there's a giant police rush as someone get hurts themselves.

87
00:04:28,327 --> 00:04:29,571
Scott: I get to talk about that.

88
00:04:30,493 --> 00:04:36,047
Rym: But it's weird how nostalgic it makes me feel for college.

89
00:04:36,107 --> 00:04:40,422
Rym: I was laying in bed and I heard like, woo, and a bunch of people yelling outside.

90
00:04:41,044 --> 00:04:43,433
Rym: And if I kept my eyes closed, I felt like I was in colony.

91
00:04:43,753 --> 00:04:46,060
Rym: I mean, you know, the warm glow of a burning couch.

92
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:46,622
Scott: Yep.

93
00:04:47,263 --> 00:04:56,330
Scott: But when they're going, woo, when it's nine thirty in the morning and I'm going or eight thirty or whatever eight to

94
00:04:56,491 --> 00:04:59,480
Rym: fuck you, I think the five thirty train,

95
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:07,698
Scott: it's like eight thirty and I'm on this train and I'm in all these college and high school kids are going woo and getting drunk because they brought beers with them and it's not good.

96
00:05:07,718 --> 00:05:11,837
Scott: And then like as soon as they get off the train in Grand Central, they all light up.

97
00:05:12,158 --> 00:05:16,373
Scott: So now it's like they got to walk through all this smoke to get back to Grand Central.

98
00:05:16,855 --> 00:05:26,090
Scott: And the only thing that saves like them from smoking actually in Grand Central is the fact that like the police lined up at the end before they actually got into the train station.

99
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,935
Rym: Yeah.

100
00:05:27,955 --> 00:05:31,104
Scott: But so, yeah, that was it was not a pleasant ride in.

101
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:37,013
Scott: I mean, the weird thing was, you know, I sort of listened to what some of the kids are saying and most of them are just saying stupid nonsense.

102
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:37,334
Scott: Yeah.

103
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:44,650
Rym: It's weird when you listen to those people because there's like the stereotype of the people what get drunk on trains and talk to each other who obviously aren't commuters.

104
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:48,950
Rym: They always have the same like, I don't know, inane would be the word.

105
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,196
Rym: But that doesn't really do it justice.

106
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:53,290
Rym: Like the conversations don't make sense.

107
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:54,880
Rym: Like I'll listen to these kids.

108
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:56,110
Scott: One thing doesn't make sense.

109
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:02,573
Scott: One thing they were saying was this is the quiet car, which to me I felt really bad for people in the other cars.

110
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:10,430
Scott: If my car was the quiet car, because even with my etymotic, it was pretty rough and I couldn't take a little nap to the train home for.

111
00:06:11,174 --> 00:06:13,790
Rym: Well, the best part of the day for me was I went out for lunch.

112
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:26,109
Rym: I went out late and I'm walking around in the street and I see like 15 high school, early college girls all lined up, all being written citations as the police pour their containers of booze onto the street.

113
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,610
Rym: It was pretty hilarious.

114
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:29,730
Rym: Two of them were crying.

115
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,233
Scott: It's good times.

116
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:35,286
Scott: But so on the towards the end of the pub crawl.

117
00:06:35,386 --> 00:06:37,889
Scott: that night of the pub crawl, was it Saturday or Sunday?

118
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:39,189
Scott: I forget which day it was.

119
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:41,450
Scott: You know, there was this police rush.

120
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:50,210
Rym: We noticed all these police cars going whoosh past our past our house because me, Scott and Emily, we were watching It Happened One Night, which is a fantastic old movie.

121
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:50,913
Scott: It's very good.

122
00:06:51,857 --> 00:06:55,114
Rym: It's like it's the opposite of the screwball comedy Scott hates, because this is a movie.

123
00:06:55,134 --> 00:06:57,210
Scott: Well, it's not that I don't like the screwball comedy.

124
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:03,210
Rym: God doesn't like it when a character is stupid and could have solved something by just saying no or punching someone.

125
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,713
Scott: Exactly.

126
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:05,269
Scott: Which is why Astro Boy is so great.

127
00:07:05,811 --> 00:07:06,012
Rym: Yeah.

128
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:10,673
Rym: But anyway, we're watching this movie and like a cop goes by like, all right, you know, that happens.

129
00:07:10,934 --> 00:07:13,790
Rym: then another then another and then like five more.

130
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,739
Rym: Basically, every cop in town went by and a couple of state troopers and then detectives start going by.

131
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,069
Scott: So do you know why?

132
00:07:20,493 --> 00:07:21,270
Rym: I have no idea.

133
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,889
Scott: I'd rest on Google News.

134
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:23,612
Scott: I didn't real.

135
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:25,927
Scott: I saw the story on Google News a couple of times, but I didn't.

136
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:29,489
Scott: I didn't actually stop to read it until I realized it said Beacon on it.

137
00:07:29,831 --> 00:07:32,650
Scott: Oh, apparently it was not just cops from Beacon.

138
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,690
Scott: It was cops from Fishkill and Newburgh and Wappingers.

139
00:07:37,392 --> 00:07:39,930
Rym: Did the incident itself happen in Beacon?

140
00:07:40,592 --> 00:07:40,934
Scott: Oh, yeah.

141
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,770
Scott: I think it happened right over there at the Barking Frog or whatever.

142
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:45,710
Rym: I wouldn't be the Barking Frog in that other bar.

143
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,610
Rym: That's like where they all congregate at the end of the night.

144
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,739
Scott: I think that's where it happened.

145
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,628
Scott: But do you know what it was?

146
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:50,890
Rym: A stabbing.

147
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,970
Scott: A three hundred man brawl.

148
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:54,465
Scott: Yeah, really.

149
00:07:54,931 --> 00:07:56,369
Scott: Oh, see that night.

150
00:07:57,193 --> 00:07:57,720
Rym: What did I say?

151
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,570
Rym: What did Rym say?

152
00:07:58,952 --> 00:08:00,549
Rym: Let's walk over there and see what's going on.

153
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:02,190
Rym: What did what did Scott Emily say?

154
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,529
Rym: Now we shouldn't go over there.

155
00:08:04,171 --> 00:08:05,350
Rym: We could have seen a brawl.

156
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:08,990
Scott: I think we were too late for the brawl by the time the cops showed up.

157
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,890
Rym: You're never too late for a brawl because the best part of the brawl is the after man.

158
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:19,570
Scott: Now, plus, I think something like 16 or so people were arrested for like riot something something.

159
00:08:20,514 --> 00:08:21,610
Rym: They were trying to wait a minute.

160
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:26,410
Rym: So we had a riot at RIT while we were there and now we had a riot in Beacon.

161
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,330
Scott: We have this power where we never actually cause any trouble.

162
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,506
Scott: But there are riots near us all the time, at least twice in less than a decade.

163
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:39,427
Rym: So I think if we live in a place for more than three years, the chance of a riot happening approaches one.

164
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:47,590
Scott: So let's move somewhere where they really want a riot, like, you know, some place that really needs one, like Darfur or something.

165
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,449
Scott: Let's move there and a riot will happen.

166
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:51,910
Rym: So usually riots rarely accomplish much.

167
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:57,090
Rym: I don't think there are any places that need riots have accomplished a little bit.

168
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:02,236
Rym: You know, I'd make a Firefly joke that's relevant, but you wouldn't get it because you don't like Firefly.

169
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:04,150
Rym: But there's a thuggy guy, right?

170
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:04,977
Rym: And his name's Jane.

171
00:09:05,058 --> 00:09:06,270
Rym: He's like the biggest thug in the world.

172
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:10,010
Rym: And a bunch of people revolted and had a riot because of some legend about him.

173
00:09:10,772 --> 00:09:11,495
Rym: And he gets drunk.

174
00:09:11,575 --> 00:09:16,968
Rym: And when he finds out about this, he says, and I quote, you guys had a riot on account of me.

175
00:09:18,575 --> 00:09:19,590
Rym: It's a very bender moment.

176
00:09:19,932 --> 00:09:21,204
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty bender right there.

177
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:22,897
Scott: They have riots.

178
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:24,329
Scott: Riots can accomplish things.

179
00:09:25,091 --> 00:09:33,570
Rym: They can accomplish me being thoroughly entertained as I watch the dogs take down a drunk college kid who tried to throw a second beer bottle at the police.

180
00:09:34,192 --> 00:09:39,152
Scott: Well, you know, there there's some famous riots that have, you know, that are that are good.

181
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:41,590
Scott: Well, the violence part is not good.

182
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,570
Rym: But, you know, name a riot that accomplished something, Scott.

183
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,674
Rym: Well, you know, there was like the at the I mean, the French Revolution, they just murdered thousands.

184
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:54,474
Scott: Well, no, like in Chicago and in the 60s with the with the students, what was the school?

185
00:09:55,138 --> 00:09:57,030
Rym: I don't think that accomplished.

186
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,490
Scott: No, but, you know, you know what I'm saying?

187
00:09:59,670 --> 00:09:59,791
Scott: Right.

188
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,629
Scott: Or like the Rodney King or whatever.

189
00:10:02,553 --> 00:10:02,856
Rym: What?

190
00:10:02,876 --> 00:10:04,510
Scott: What do you mean?

191
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:05,073
Scott: What?

192
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,107
Rym: I don't think I agree with you here.

193
00:10:08,051 --> 00:10:11,209
Scott: But, you know, it wasn't riots just like drunken woo.

194
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,169
Scott: It was, you know, it was a serious thing.

195
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,558
Rym: But that I wouldn't say it's a I don't.

196
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:19,470
Rym: I think everyone involved would have been better off had those riots not happened.

197
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:21,790
Rym: Meanwhile, the riot at RIT was awesome.

198
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:25,950
Scott: Well, at RIT, it wasn't much of a riot, really.

199
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:31,350
Rym: It would have been more of a riot if the police hadn't come in in full SWAT gear with the pepper paint right away.

200
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,310
Scott: Well, I mean, according to a newspaper, right.

201
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:39,969
Scott: The what happened near us was a brawl, which is a little different from RIT, which is just a woo times a lot.

202
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,309
Rym: Well, the chant of they can't.

203
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,667
Scott: There's a difference between woo and hoda hoda hoda hoda hoda.

204
00:10:50,562 --> 00:10:53,178
Rym: So anyway, it's video game day.

205
00:10:54,763 --> 00:10:55,960
Rym: What do you got for me, Scott?

206
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:03,265
Scott: So there was I guess there was some video game news going around, like, you know, you know, like the.

207
00:11:03,285 --> 00:11:06,986
Scott: there's part of the iPhone announcement today had some video game stuff in there.

208
00:11:07,027 --> 00:11:08,280
Scott: But I don't I don't give a shit.

209
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:08,622
Scott: Right.

210
00:11:08,662 --> 00:11:11,760
Rym: But I got I got stuff to say about all that anyway.

211
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:24,120
Scott: On Steam, Square Enix is on there now, which is sort of weird because you don't think of them as a PC game company or you think of them more as a PlayStation, you know, Super Nintendo and portable.

212
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:24,541
Scott: Right.

213
00:11:24,622 --> 00:11:29,865
Scott: But now they got some PC games and one of the games they have in there is Last Remnant.

214
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:31,540
Scott: So what the hell?

215
00:11:31,642 --> 00:11:32,519
Scott: It's a free demo.

216
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,980
Scott: Why the fuck not?

217
00:11:34,142 --> 00:11:34,407
Scott: Right.

218
00:11:34,448 --> 00:11:34,937
Scott: I played it.

219
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:38,110
Scott: I didn't play the whole demo because it was.

220
00:11:38,793 --> 00:11:41,126
Scott: as I'm not even going to I'm not even going to delay.

221
00:11:41,146 --> 00:11:42,078
Scott: It was pretty ass.

222
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,556
Rym: Well, you didn't say it right.

223
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:46,300
Rym: And there you go.

224
00:11:47,961 --> 00:11:56,439
Scott: So basically this game sucks for all the same reasons that Final Fantasy eight sucks only with more suckage added on top of that.

225
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:56,842
Scott: Right.

226
00:11:57,265 --> 00:11:59,520
Scott: So so just so people understand what I'm talking about.

227
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:06,440
Scott: I played the Final Fantasy eight demo on the PC a long time ago, and I also played it on the PlayStation a little bit, you know, to its credit.

228
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,306
Rym: I will say one thing.

229
00:12:07,467 --> 00:12:09,380
Rym: I did not like the game Final Fantasy eight.

230
00:12:09,904 --> 00:12:11,200
Rym: I think it would have made a great movie.

231
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,396
Scott: No, no, probably.

232
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:12,559
Scott: Yeah.

233
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:18,859
Scott: But the main problem I had with Final Fantasy eight and was that the menu, you know, you had to play the game of these menu things.

234
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:25,820
Scott: Yet those basically menu things, there are menus, they were complicated, nonintuitive and incomprehensible, even with the instruction manual.

235
00:12:25,981 --> 00:12:26,202
Scott: Right.

236
00:12:26,724 --> 00:12:32,020
Scott: And I was like, I do the tutorial and the tutorial would be like, use a conjunction to combine magic.

237
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,840
Scott: So I'd go into the menu and the word conjunction would be great out.

238
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,839
Scott: And I'd be like, you just told me to do this.

239
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:41,560
Scott: And the menu option is great out and it doesn't do anything.

240
00:12:42,142 --> 00:12:45,180
Scott: And I just got so frustrated with that incomprehensible bullshit.

241
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:49,560
Scott: And because I couldn't figure out what they wanted, I couldn't beat any guys.

242
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:51,860
Scott: So I died and was like, fuck that game.

243
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:54,357
Rym: Yet I at least figured that part out.

244
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:55,187
Scott: I couldn't.

245
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:56,079
Scott: I couldn't even get that far.

246
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:01,568
Rym: My beefs with the game were more long term and dealt with, you know, general Final Fantasy issues.

247
00:13:01,608 --> 00:13:03,260
Scott: But anyway, so this game last remnant.

248
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:03,581
Scott: Right.

249
00:13:03,923 --> 00:13:11,060
Scott: So I start playing the game and basically, you know, there's a little bit of intro bits, but it sort of lets me play relatively quickly, which is nice.

250
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:15,240
Scott: And I was using my Xbox 360 controller for the PC, which made it also nice.

251
00:13:15,481 --> 00:13:15,641
Scott: Right.

252
00:13:16,988 --> 00:13:19,600
Scott: So I'm in a room with all these people and I can talk to them.

253
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,560
Scott: And the user interface of talking is pretty good.

254
00:13:21,642 --> 00:13:21,785
Scott: Right.

255
00:13:21,805 --> 00:13:22,520
Scott: You sort of look at you.

256
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,740
Scott: It's a third person walking around thing and I'm walking around.

257
00:13:27,061 --> 00:13:30,121
Scott: And, you know, if there's someone to talk to, they have a speech bubble above their head.

258
00:13:30,181 --> 00:13:30,382
Scott: Right.

259
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,782
Scott: So I look at different people and whoever I'm looking at has the speech bubble.

260
00:13:34,144 --> 00:13:35,974
Scott: So that's how I know I can push A to.

261
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:37,100
Scott: I always know who I'm talking to.

262
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,381
Scott: Right.

263
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:42,886
Scott: So I talk to everyone in the room and then I talk to the king and the king tells me to do some stuff.

264
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,819
Scott: So there's a map and there's all these places to go.

265
00:13:45,361 --> 00:13:47,958
Scott: So I go to a place and there's all these people to talk to.

266
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:53,919
Scott: So I'm like talking to people and doing nothing but talking to people for a good like 10 minutes.

267
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,879
Rym: Meanwhile, back in Resident Evil land, zombies going up the hill.

268
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:58,783
Scott: Right.

269
00:13:59,045 --> 00:14:00,600
Scott: It's like I'm just going around talking to people.

270
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,260
Scott: And I'm like, fuck, I don't want to talk to people.

271
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,170
Scott: I want to do something.

272
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,020
Scott: Where the hell is the game?

273
00:14:06,182 --> 00:14:06,403
Scott: Right.

274
00:14:06,885 --> 00:14:10,566
Scott: So and plus what they were saying, I didn't care about it, didn't make any sense.

275
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:11,760
Scott: I guess it looked kind of pretty.

276
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,160
Scott: Right.

277
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:22,580
Scott: Anyway, I eventually talked to someone who was like, you know, and I forget exactly what they were saying, but it was basically like, hey, you want to go fight in a dungeon where there's an adventure?

278
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,569
Scott: Let's go on this quest.

279
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:24,440
Scott: And I could be like, yes, no.

280
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,388
Scott: So I was like, yeah, let's go.

281
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:26,560
Scott: Fuck, finally.

282
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:28,480
Scott: So I pretty much just like, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

283
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,939
Scott: To everything that they said until I actually got somewhere with something to do.

284
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:35,880
Scott: So I get there, this dungeon and there's some more talking.

285
00:14:37,621 --> 00:14:41,960
Scott: And then eventually I'm done talking and I see sort of a monster walking around.

286
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:42,427
Scott: So that was.

287
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:43,200
Scott: that was nice.

288
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:44,780
Scott: It wasn't random encounters, right?

289
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:45,123
Scott: It was.

290
00:14:45,345 --> 00:14:46,859
Scott: you can see a monster over there.

291
00:14:47,322 --> 00:14:49,660
Scott: And if you want to fight it, you know, you walk over to it.

292
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:55,020
Scott: And instead of the speech bubble above its head, it's like two swords, right, that are crossed, which means combat.

293
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:55,867
Rym: All right.

294
00:14:55,887 --> 00:14:56,071
Rym: All right.

295
00:14:56,802 --> 00:14:57,940
Scott: So I enter some combat.

296
00:14:58,441 --> 00:15:04,939
Scott: And for some reason, even though up until now I've only ever seen my one character, I had a whole party I didn't know about.

297
00:15:05,586 --> 00:15:06,379
Scott: So that was a little strange.

298
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:10,700
Scott: And I go to fight this monster and like this combat.

299
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:20,620
Scott: Right now, I expected, you know, RPG turn based combat guys, good guys on the left, bad guys on the right, attack, magic, defend, run away, that sort of thing.

300
00:15:20,701 --> 00:15:20,922
Scott: Right.

301
00:15:21,548 --> 00:15:22,980
Scott: And I think that was in there somewhere.

302
00:15:23,581 --> 00:15:29,080
Scott: But if it was, I couldn't find it because basically what happened is this camera is jumping around all over the place.

303
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:32,420
Scott: It's like and everyone is like constantly doing something.

304
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,840
Scott: So it's like it's like a bad guy attacked me, another bad guy attacked someone else.

305
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,120
Scott: And I attacked someone and I couldn't figure out what the hell was going on.

306
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,360
Scott: There was no explanation, no tutorial, no nothing.

307
00:15:42,882 --> 00:15:45,020
Scott: There was some choices to me, like push buttons.

308
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:50,784
Scott: But it wasn't like basic, you know, comprehensible things like attack that bad guy.

309
00:15:51,107 --> 00:15:52,199
Scott: It was it was something else.

310
00:15:52,662 --> 00:15:57,308
Scott: And I just sort of like push some buttons and then some stuff happened and I didn't understand it.

311
00:15:57,329 --> 00:15:58,019
Scott: And I think I won.

312
00:15:58,682 --> 00:16:03,283
Scott: I killed the bad guys, but it was going so fast and the camera was jumping all over the place.

313
00:16:03,304 --> 00:16:04,138
Scott: I didn't I couldn't tell.

314
00:16:04,804 --> 00:16:05,979
Scott: It just sort of did its thing.

315
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,883
Scott: And I was like, what the.

316
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:23,386
Scott: So after all that talking and not doing anything I cared about, there was a combat which, you know, if it was a standard RPG combat that I was used to, I would have been like, OK, it's a lovely RPG, but it was a RPG combat that made no sense.

317
00:16:23,426 --> 00:16:25,060
Scott: So I was like all that.

318
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,378
Scott: And there's still no game here.

319
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:29,990
Scott: The game is just walk around and like.

320
00:16:30,632 --> 00:16:33,565
Scott: there was no game as far as I could tell, at least in this demo.

321
00:16:33,585 --> 00:16:36,000
Scott: And at that point, I didn't even finish the demo.

322
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,120
Scott: I was just like, fuck this, I'm done.

323
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:54,519
Scott: I mean, I expected it to be a black modern RPG that I would not like, but it was just, you know, if it was a black modern RPG, you know, say something like, you know, like a Final Fantasy seven kind of structure to it.

324
00:16:55,004 --> 00:16:56,520
Scott: I probably would have played the whole demo.

325
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,180
Scott: I wouldn't have been like, oh, it's the best game ever.

326
00:16:58,261 --> 00:17:00,360
Scott: But I've been like, hey, it's a standard RPG.

327
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:00,862
Scott: What do you want?

328
00:17:00,922 --> 00:17:02,308
Scott: But no, this was.

329
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:04,920
Scott: this was pretty painful for me to play.

330
00:17:05,181 --> 00:17:12,739
Scott: So painful, I couldn't bear to continue or bother to invest any amount of effort to figure it out because it was not worth it.

331
00:17:13,181 --> 00:17:22,500
Scott: It's like even if I had taken the time to figure out how that combat worked, there was no conceivable way in which that combat would have been fun, no matter how it worked.

332
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,980
Scott: It would it was less.

333
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,895
Scott: Even if I knew every detail about the system, it would have been.

334
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:29,015
Scott: I can.

335
00:17:29,196 --> 00:17:33,760
Scott: I just know it would have been less fun than like Final Fantasy six combat.

336
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:49,130
Scott: So fucking last remnant demo on steam, if you like Japanese RPGs and such, you know, maybe I guess Final Fantasy, more of the recent ones like twelve or X two or whatever the hell they're doing now, you might want to try it.

337
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:51,719
Scott: Hell, it's a free demo.

338
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,900
Scott: Try it anyway.

339
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:58,879
Scott: You know, who gives a shit, but don't spend your money on it unless you're a crazy Square Enix fanboy.

340
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:03,159
Rym: Well, I haven't played it, so I guess I can't say you should you should try it.

341
00:18:03,521 --> 00:18:03,864
Rym: Should I?

342
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,060
Rym: Yeah, maybe I will try the free demo.

343
00:18:06,422 --> 00:18:07,559
Scott: Don't try the real thing.

344
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:09,440
Rym: But there's there's much more.

345
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,060
Rym: It's pretty news something.

346
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,770
Rym: It's frightening, but in a different way, this.

347
00:18:14,152 --> 00:18:16,162
Rym: this sounds like it was frightening in a very visceral way.

348
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:30,047
Rym: I realized how old I am today because 10 years and one day ago, an entire decade ago on this day and another day on this day, March 17th, well, 10 years and a day.

349
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,581
Scott: OK, so March 16.

350
00:18:31,581 --> 00:18:31,841
Scott: All right.

351
00:18:32,423 --> 00:18:33,447
Rym: EverQuest started.

352
00:18:34,872 --> 00:18:37,420
Rym: EverQuest is 10 years, 10 years ago was EverQuest.

353
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,700
Rym: You know, it was 10 years before EverQuest Paris Troika.

354
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:41,641
Scott: Yeah.

355
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:45,640
Scott: So that's sort of crazy because I remember in late high school.

356
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,424
Scott: So we're talking.

357
00:18:46,504 --> 00:18:50,334
Scott: it must have been like ninety seven, ninety eight, something around those times.

358
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:50,558
Scott: Right.

359
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,588
Rym: Nineteen ninety seven.

360
00:18:51,608 --> 00:18:52,919
Scott: I was playing some muds.

361
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:54,127
Scott: I was playing muds.

362
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:56,140
Scott: I had a mud client on a floppy disk.

363
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:11,119
Scott: I'd bring to school, press F3 to get the search window, then right click on something and explore, get the to get Explorer open because they took the icon away, go to the a drive, double click on my mud client, then connect to the mud server and play muds in the computer lab during study hall.

364
00:19:11,444 --> 00:19:12,580
Rym: See, I carried around.

365
00:19:12,741 --> 00:19:16,260
Rym: I had the realm installer and I would install the realm on all the PCs I use.

366
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:17,222
Rym: Whoa.

367
00:19:17,383 --> 00:19:21,240
Scott: Yeah, I installed a thing where it knew when you installed something.

368
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,024
Scott: So it would work.

369
00:19:22,526 --> 00:19:26,559
Scott: But then someone would get alerted to it and they'd come and get you like I installed flash once.

370
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,419
Rym: And they're like, hey, see, well, I just logged in through the winds.

371
00:19:31,361 --> 00:19:32,129
Scott: We didn't have winds.

372
00:19:32,149 --> 00:19:33,340
Scott: We had Nobel Netwares.

373
00:19:33,921 --> 00:19:40,479
Rym: See, we had the winds and I had the administrator password because it was written on a piece of paper on the desk in the computer room.

374
00:19:41,086 --> 00:19:41,309
Scott: Wow.

375
00:19:41,391 --> 00:19:41,492
Scott: Wow.

376
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,760
Scott: But anyway, the mud that I played, I forget what the mud was called.

377
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,630
Scott: My brother also played it, but it was just.

378
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:53,000
Scott: it was just some it was just a mud out there that had like 50 or so people playing it.

379
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,440
Scott: And I even made a cool area in the mud and whatever.

380
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,894
Scott: But the mud was running on.

381
00:19:59,914 --> 00:20:01,940
Scott: you know, there are many mud engines out there.

382
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,161
Scott: Right.

383
00:20:02,181 --> 00:20:06,303
Scott: And it was this one was running on Daiku mud, which was a very popular mud engine in the days.

384
00:20:07,148 --> 00:20:09,300
Scott: And people don't realize this nowadays.

385
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:17,059
Scott: But EverQuest, you know, and in those days, you know, before my newfound, you know, I'm pretty sure we've talked about this on the show before.

386
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:17,681
Scott: Yeah.

387
00:20:17,721 --> 00:20:22,500
Scott: But in those days, long before, you know, MMOs and my dislike of them.

388
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:22,861
Scott: Right.

389
00:20:23,162 --> 00:20:32,400
Scott: I was like, oh, man, if only this had graphics amends amends and EverQuest is literally it is a Daiku mud with graphics.

390
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,558
Scott: That's literally what it is.

391
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:36,159
Scott: People don't realize that, but it's the exact same thing.

392
00:20:36,461 --> 00:20:45,940
Rym: But I realize now what's going on with MMOs because thinking about EverQuest being this old and seeing the progression in the areas of MMOs, it is EverQuest still playable.

393
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:47,780
Rym: I imagine.

394
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,321
Rym: All right.

395
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:56,201
Rym: EverQuest went live on March 16th, nineteen ninety nine and rose to gamer fame over the next decade, spawning fifteen expansions, full blown sequel, blah, blah, blah, whatever.

396
00:20:56,241 --> 00:21:02,965
Rym: Anyway, what I realized is that remember FPS is FPS is came out and there were a few initial forays.

397
00:21:03,366 --> 00:21:08,699
Rym: and then there was like the Doom era where Doom was the FPS and there were a lot of copiers of Doom.

398
00:21:09,124 --> 00:21:09,798
Rym: But Doom was it.

399
00:21:10,221 --> 00:21:13,680
Rym: And some people played all those kind of half ass Doom clones and whatever.

400
00:21:14,701 --> 00:21:19,160
Rym: And it took a long time for someone to break the mold and make a different game.

401
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,840
Rym: You know, that was when Quake came out and that was like the first steps.

402
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,320
Rym: And then there was the Quake two era rise of the trade and that lasted forever.

403
00:21:26,421 --> 00:21:28,060
Rym: And then, you know, after that, things changed.

404
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,559
Rym: Then there was like the third era and FPS has kept changing.

405
00:21:31,882 --> 00:21:33,138
Rym: MMOs are not that old.

406
00:21:33,621 --> 00:21:38,857
Rym: And I feel like the MMOs have not tried that much ground compared to like.

407
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:44,080
Rym: they're having the same number of eras, but it's taking more time to get from one era to the next.

408
00:21:44,722 --> 00:21:55,121
Rym: I mean, MMOs today are like the World of Warcraft, which is like the best MMO in the world is basically just the kind of most polished you can have version of the original MMO.

409
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:58,060
Scott: Yeah, it's fundamentally on the fundamental level.

410
00:21:58,221 --> 00:22:00,900
Scott: It is identical to the Daiku mud.

411
00:22:01,261 --> 00:22:04,736
Scott: It's just that what they did is they polished all of the surface level.

412
00:22:04,776 --> 00:22:11,878
Scott: frustrations is the same way that, you know, Mario three is actually fundamentally identical.

413
00:22:11,938 --> 00:22:15,259
Scott: to say Mario one is really no different than the same thing.

414
00:22:15,662 --> 00:22:18,300
Scott: It's just Mario three has all this polish on it.

415
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:19,759
Scott: And that's what World of Warcraft is.

416
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,543
Scott: It's the same thing.

417
00:22:20,563 --> 00:22:24,160
Rym: But then Mario 64 was I mean, the different dimension.

418
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:25,920
Rym: You were basically making a different game.

419
00:22:26,264 --> 00:22:27,240
Rym: It is completely different.

420
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,196
Rym: And FPS is when they jump to 3D.

421
00:22:30,303 --> 00:22:30,930
Rym: Everything changed.

422
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:31,880
Rym: It was a completely different game.

423
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,140
Rym: And then the Half-Life mod revolution changed things a thousand times over again.

424
00:22:36,881 --> 00:22:41,721
Rym: But MMOs like World of Warcraft, I don't feel like it's really gotten past its roots and no one.

425
00:22:42,365 --> 00:22:45,360
Rym: I don't see anyone doing anything terribly innovative.

426
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:48,259
Rym: And the people that are those MMOs don't succeed.

427
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:55,399
Scott: Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of MMOs that try to do something cool or pretend they're doing something cool, but really they're not.

428
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:06,050
Rym: But anyway, I don't want to talk about EverQuest, so it's time for things of the day.

429
00:23:06,211 --> 00:23:12,233
Rym: Now, this might seem like a strange aside, but it's relevant to my interest and I hope you find it cool.

430
00:23:12,715 --> 00:23:22,402
Rym: A while ago, I talked about this book by Dan Simmons called The Terror, and I highly recommend it unless you're squeamish because you'll learn a lot about scurvy and lead poisoning and yetis.

431
00:23:24,018 --> 00:23:24,628
Scott: I like yetis.

432
00:23:25,578 --> 00:23:25,964
Rym: It is a...

433
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,325
Scott: Wait, what's your favorite yeti?

434
00:23:29,656 --> 00:23:30,749
Rym: The Abominable Snowman.

435
00:23:31,313 --> 00:23:31,730
Scott: From what?

436
00:23:32,191 --> 00:23:37,866
Rym: I assume you're referring to the one that is modeled after Of Mice and Men, the Bugs Bunny one.

437
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,610
Scott: No, let's talk about the one in Ski Free.

438
00:23:41,631 --> 00:23:45,149
Scott: Oh, I like the one in Ski Free because he's like...

439
00:23:47,313 --> 00:23:49,709
Rym: So I hated him because he stopped me from skiing free.

440
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:51,910
Scott: Well, no, I dodged him.

441
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,150
Scott: What's the most times you ever dodged him in one go?

442
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,789
Rym: I don't know, like once I played Ski Free a few times and got sick of it.

443
00:23:57,274 --> 00:23:58,309
Scott: Oh, I played Ski Free a lot.

444
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,509
Scott: I could dodge the snowman like five times in a row.

445
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:04,690
Rym: But anyway, this is a fantastic book and Dan Simmons is a fantastic author.

446
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:29,710
Rym: But the book I didn't realize until I got about three quarters of the way through was based with one important exception, that exception being yetis on an absolutely true story and the number of like primary resources and accounts that the book, the accuracy of the book in terms of names and people and letters kind of disturbed me when I realized that these were real people who died.

447
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:34,030
Rym: And I was reading this account that was, with the exception of yetis, 100 percent accurate.

448
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,123
Rym: But the thing is, the book points out that, you know, this.

449
00:24:38,283 --> 00:24:41,209
Rym: this was an Arctic expedition where everyone died.

450
00:24:41,692 --> 00:24:47,450
Rym: And part of the reason they died was that everyone went insane from lead poisoning and died of botulism and scurvy.

451
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,749
Rym: It was a horrible experience.

452
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,788
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty bad.

453
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:55,569
Rym: Well, there was a lot of debate as to what happened and like what really went on and why they died.

454
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:59,749
Scott: And people in the Arctic unprepared will have those things happen to them.

455
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,048
Scott: That's pretty much it.

456
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:04,666
Rym: But similar expeditions had death rates of 15 to 20 percent.

457
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:06,462
Rym: This one had 100 percent.

458
00:25:07,071 --> 00:25:09,030
Rym: And the thing is, people wondered what happened.

459
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:16,410
Rym: And eventually they found the bodies and then they discovered that the bodies all were full of lead, like tons of lead, like crazy amounts of lead.

460
00:25:16,893 --> 00:25:18,650
Rym: So they were trying to figure out why.

461
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:21,870
Rym: And they were blaming the solder on the tin food for a bunch of things.

462
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:32,810
Rym: And I found this theory, this PDF that explains probably the best scientific theory as to what happened to these people that has ever been put forth.

463
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:33,995
Rym: And it is.

464
00:25:34,015 --> 00:25:37,090
Rym: it is absolutely a fascinating read.

465
00:25:37,251 --> 00:25:37,628
Rym: It's short.

466
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:38,729
Rym: You can understand it.

467
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:39,750
Rym: It's not super technical.

468
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:40,847
Rym: It's pretty well backed up.

469
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:47,890
Rym: It is entitled Identification of the Probable Source of the Lead Poisoning Observed in Members of the Franklin Expedition.

470
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:50,550
Rym: The Franklin Expedition is famous.

471
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,790
Rym: You can read about it on Wikipedia.

472
00:25:52,611 --> 00:25:55,590
Rym: If you want to read about it plus yetis, you can read Dan Simmons, The Terror.

473
00:25:57,291 --> 00:26:10,770
Rym: Seriously, this is a this is really neat to read, because basically the reason there was so much lead in these bodies was that they use this awesome, fancy, modern system of distilling fresh water from steam, from salt water.

474
00:26:11,594 --> 00:26:13,070
Rym: And they made the whole thing out of lead.

475
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:19,470
Rym: And within a year of being out at sea and trapped in the ice, everyone on the ship was completely insane with terminal lead poisoning.

476
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:24,348
Scott: So if they had made that fancy system out of like steel, it would have been all good iron.

477
00:26:25,111 --> 00:26:26,688
Rym: There's a good chance they would have made it.

478
00:26:26,973 --> 00:26:27,287
Scott: Wow.

479
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:27,736
Scott: Yeah.

480
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:28,556
Rym: Dang.

481
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:34,568
Rym: Now, the thing is, botulism also played a big role because they went with the lowest bidder for the tin food.

482
00:26:36,272 --> 00:26:38,289
Rym: But the lead was the primary factor here.

483
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:39,216
Scott: Mm hmm.

484
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:39,971
Scott: What?

485
00:26:40,775 --> 00:26:43,390
Scott: There's no way to go back and punish that tin food guy.

486
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,470
Rym: No, there really isn't.

487
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:48,710
Rym: But the thing is, I found that out and then I read all the history and I'm mad at that guy.

488
00:26:48,972 --> 00:26:50,989
Rym: I'm really mad, but he's already dead.

489
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:51,991
Scott: Yeah.

490
00:26:52,052 --> 00:26:54,190
Scott: It's like he did it to himself and others.

491
00:26:54,993 --> 00:26:56,710
Rym: But I don't think he died of lead poisoning.

492
00:26:57,713 --> 00:26:59,310
Rym: Oh, maybe he died of too much money.

493
00:26:59,470 --> 00:26:59,756
Rym: I don't know.

494
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,989
Scott: OK, anyway, this is a fascinating read.

495
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:07,569
Scott: So really, you know, looking at Nintendo's like what games are coming out from them.

496
00:27:07,936 --> 00:27:08,210
Scott: Yeah.

497
00:27:08,411 --> 00:27:11,390
Scott: There's only one real game that is looking any good in the near future.

498
00:27:11,511 --> 00:27:12,770
Scott: That's the Punch-Out remake.

499
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:13,976
Rym: Oh, my God.

500
00:27:14,017 --> 00:27:15,470
Rym: I think I made the trailer for that.

501
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,209
Rym: My thing of the day.

502
00:27:16,731 --> 00:27:20,870
Scott: Speaking of Punch-Out, I have a Mike Tyson related thing of the day.

503
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:22,050
Rym: Oh, yes.

504
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,290
Rym: We've had him on before.

505
00:27:24,131 --> 00:27:24,433
Scott: Yeah.

506
00:27:24,533 --> 00:27:31,969
Scott: You know, as I've said before, Mike Tyson is a terrible person, but he's incredibly fascinating and was incredibly talented at beating the shit out of people.

507
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:35,990
Rym: Watching him punch people is like watching a gazelle punch people.

508
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:36,472
Scott: Right.

509
00:27:37,085 --> 00:27:37,248
Scott: So.

510
00:27:38,552 --> 00:27:42,690
Scott: Here is a photo gallery of Mike Tyson punching people.

511
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:49,810
Rym: No, of at the parapety at the moment where someone realizes they're about to be punched by Mike Tyson.

512
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:58,470
Scott: No, this is a photo gallery of Mike Tyson's abandoned Ohio mansion.

513
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:03,990
Scott: Oh, there's like pool full of green water.

514
00:28:04,674 --> 00:28:06,110
Scott: There's stereo equipment.

515
00:28:06,292 --> 00:28:07,022
Scott: It's like VCRs.

516
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,890
Scott: And it's it's weird because you look at this place.

517
00:28:10,051 --> 00:28:10,312
Scott: Right.

518
00:28:10,874 --> 00:28:13,185
Scott: And it's such like 80s and 90s luxury.

519
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,710
Scott: There's like furniture lying around and stuff.

520
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:22,921
Scott: And I mean, like this is like a dual cassette deck and an old cable box, dual cassette.

521
00:28:23,265 --> 00:28:23,610
Rym: Yeah.

522
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:28,950
Scott: You can dub his own tapes and like you just look at like the switches on the wall.

523
00:28:29,491 --> 00:28:30,635
Scott: It's like everything about.

524
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,564
Scott: it is so 80s and 90s, but it's.

525
00:28:33,805 --> 00:28:35,530
Scott: it's very, very interesting.

526
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:38,029
Scott: And you should take a look.

527
00:28:38,452 --> 00:28:41,210
Scott: And it's amazing, like how much stuff is just left in there, you know?

528
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,475
Scott: Well, I guess no one wants.

529
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:46,430
Scott: no one wants this place, I guess, because it's in Ohio.

530
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:49,169
Rym: And I'm going to make a joke about that.

531
00:28:49,391 --> 00:28:52,070
Scott: And also because, you know, Mike Tyson's name is written over.

532
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,850
Scott: He's like his name is on the front gate.

533
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:56,630
Scott: His name is on the patio, as you know, like the Hammer Mansion.

534
00:28:57,453 --> 00:28:57,758
Scott: Yeah.

535
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:58,409
Scott: Sort of like the hair.

536
00:28:58,651 --> 00:28:58,852
Scott: Right.

537
00:28:58,892 --> 00:29:00,922
Scott: But, you know, it's really kind of.

538
00:29:00,942 --> 00:29:04,070
Scott: I mean, it's like this really weird zebra print like carpet.

539
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:06,670
Scott: It's you should check it out.

540
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:07,648
Scott: It's it's pretty cool.

541
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,405
Scott: I kind of want to go there.

542
00:29:10,632 --> 00:29:16,568
Rym: So the other day we were sitting around thinking of something to do, you know, the usual beacon crew with this harkens back to our days.

543
00:29:17,431 --> 00:29:22,854
Rym: We'll spend more time sitting around thinking, hey, what should we do than actually doing anything?

544
00:29:23,878 --> 00:29:30,270
Rym: But suddenly the idea came to us to play four swords because we had Emily, who had never played it, and we had Alex who played it a little bit.

545
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,989
Rym: But and none of us had actually played it all the way through.

546
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:33,431
Scott: Yeah.

547
00:29:33,451 --> 00:29:45,190
Scott: And four swords is a game that I've played, you know, many times, but I've played like the early parts of the game over and over because every time we played, we started from the beginning and no, we never actually continued to get to the end.

548
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:51,729
Scott: So I've only played like half the game, maybe, and I've played like the first parts of the game, you know, multiple times.

549
00:29:52,311 --> 00:30:03,130
Rym: Now, it just so happens to that we have in our possession a basket of, I think, five GBAs and an SP and an extra D.S

550
00:30:03,491 --> 00:30:15,169
Scott: It's weird to think, right, when Nintendo first came out with this GBA GameCube connection cable system, right, for it was mostly used for four swords and Crystal Chronicles and not much else that I could think of.

551
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:20,556
Scott: I guess you could use it with WarioWare GameCube so that you could use the GBA as your controller.

552
00:30:20,657 --> 00:30:21,810
Rym: But there was no point.

553
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:22,862
Scott: But I used it.

554
00:30:22,903 --> 00:30:23,389
Scott: It was all right.

555
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:30,370
Scott: You used it because you could not that for any other reason, because I guess the GBA was a little bit simpler controller for you.

556
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,130
Scott: There were some micro games where it helped.

557
00:30:32,732 --> 00:30:34,807
Rym: Yeah, but I kind of like to fidget with the L and R.

558
00:30:35,491 --> 00:30:38,129
Scott: Yeah, well, it was actually easier to do the L and R on the.

559
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,790
Rym: No, but you get so much analog.

560
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,750
Rym: You get so much more fidgeting with the GameCube.

561
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,550
Scott: Yeah, but you can push it so many more times with the digital.

562
00:30:45,772 --> 00:30:55,090
Scott: Anyway, the you know, and it was at the time that came out, there was all this, you know, hubbub like who has four GBAs and four cables?

563
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:57,630
Scott: And it was like, well, everyone should have one GBA.

564
00:30:58,312 --> 00:31:00,709
Scott: And if you have three friends, they should all have one GBA.

565
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:04,930
Scott: Well, Nintendo made everyone buy one of these lousy cables for like 10 bucks.

566
00:31:05,211 --> 00:31:07,149
Rym: Nintendo assumed two things.

567
00:31:07,731 --> 00:31:21,229
Rym: And these two assumptions, I feel like more and more, especially after reading that whole Miyamoto was said during the GameCube era thing, Nintendo assumed that one, people want good games and two, that people who play games have friends.

568
00:31:21,804 --> 00:31:21,990
Scott: Yeah.

569
00:31:22,531 --> 00:31:26,550
Scott: And those were two assumptions that they sort of, I guess, realized were wrong.

570
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:42,550
Rym: Well, at least have friends that live near them, because I realized that outside of college, very few people can snap their fingers and have four geeky friends willing to sit down and play a video game at the same time together.

571
00:31:43,733 --> 00:31:47,290
Rym: But yet in college, we had like 30 people who all had GPUs.

572
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:56,450
Rym: When Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles came out, there were like five independent parties of four all playing the game the same weekend that we knew of.

573
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,469
Rym: That was just the people in our friend group.

574
00:31:58,771 --> 00:32:05,230
Rym: It was pretty much everyone at RIT who wasn't masturbating or playing Counter-Strike or getting drunk was playing Crystal Chronicles that weekend.

575
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:05,718
Scott: Yep.

576
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:14,490
Scott: But anyway, so, you know, with four swords, you know, and these four, you know, you needed these four GBAs and a GameCube and the game.

577
00:32:15,292 --> 00:32:18,270
Scott: Not a lot of people have had this experience, right?

578
00:32:18,591 --> 00:32:22,290
Scott: But the reality is that it's actually completely fantastic.

579
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:22,671
Scott: When I

580
00:32:22,711 --> 00:32:45,089
Rym: think back to the GameCube era, I mean, there were like, it's weird how I look back now and I liked a lot of games in the GameCube, but after a couple of years of the Wii and playing a lot of the new games that Nintendo has been pushing out, I find myself gravitating when I have people over, you know, friend games, playing games with people in person more and more to GameCube games because the Wii is just not doing

581
00:32:45,109 --> 00:32:45,149
Scott: it.

582
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:50,650
Scott: I mean, like the Smash Brothers for the Wii is an improvement over the GameCube, at least a little bit, right?

583
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:53,690
Rym: Well, because it's just an incremental improvement on the GameCube game.

584
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,910
Scott: They brought Mario Tennis to the Wii.

585
00:32:57,412 --> 00:33:01,528
Scott: It's the same exact game, only worse because they changed the controls, which were perfect.

586
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,890
Rym: And we need not speak of the abortion that was Smooth Moves.

587
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:11,830
Rym: That game, that game was the biggest disparity between what I expected from a game and what I got that I've ever experienced.

588
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:16,310
Rym: All expectations for everything in the rest of my life were lowered as a result of playing that game.

589
00:33:16,354 --> 00:33:16,486
Rym: Yep.

590
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,456
Rym: You've got wept the day.

591
00:33:18,938 --> 00:33:25,190
Scott: you've got some WiiWare party games on the Wii, like the Bomberman, which is actually kind of nice because you can get all eight people on it.

592
00:33:25,652 --> 00:33:27,469
Scott: It says, yeah, it's pretty good.

593
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:37,790
Rym: But it begs me how few people have played what I feel were some of the best multiplayer in the same room offerings in all of gaming.

594
00:33:38,232 --> 00:33:45,825
Scott: Yeah, I mean, Crystal Chronicles for the GameCube, even though Crystal Chronicles is really just sort of gauntlet as game wise, right?

595
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:55,090
Scott: The the experience of each person having different information on their little Game Boy really just changes the whole thing around.

596
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,890
Rym: It's weird how people look at the Wii and how innovative it was.

597
00:33:58,171 --> 00:34:03,210
Rym: But really, when you look back, the GameCube was where Nintendo really innovated.

598
00:34:03,411 --> 00:34:08,370
Rym: And I guess they realized that a lot of their innovation is not how to make money.

599
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:16,489
Rym: I mean, I don't think anyone would say that the the GameCube controller hook up to the GBA was abominable failure.

600
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:17,949
Rym: Yeah, all fronts.

601
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,710
Scott: It was pretty much a monster, a monstrous failure.

602
00:34:20,931 --> 00:34:24,451
Scott: If you're from business perspective, you know, it probably didn't make them a lot of money.

603
00:34:24,491 --> 00:34:30,089
Scott: Well, Nintendo profits off everything, but it made them probably pennies compared to what they're making now.

604
00:34:30,192 --> 00:34:30,550
Scott: Right.

605
00:34:32,031 --> 00:34:40,929
Scott: But actually, the games that came out of it and the potential for other games that never happened was so crazily large and so crazily amazing.

606
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:48,283
Scott: I mean, you think about co-op games, nothing beats the co-op of the four GBA GameCube system.

607
00:34:48,406 --> 00:34:48,570
Scott: Yes.

608
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:52,070
Rym: I mean, co-op with multiplayer on the PC or on the Xbox is great.

609
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,589
Rym: And that's a wonderful way to play games.

610
00:34:54,032 --> 00:34:57,569
Rym: But there's a different kind of gaming when you're sharing the same room.

611
00:34:58,232 --> 00:35:09,790
Rym: And in the past, like until the first until these controllers came out, the only way to do that really was to either have hot seat, which isn't the same thing, or to have the split screen, which, while great.

612
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:13,890
Rym: I mean, I remember I have fond memories of Bond was still not a massive improvement.

613
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:29,109
Rym: But what the GameCube controller hook up with the GBA had to offer was a shared space in a physical location among four people, coupled with secret information, a private space for each individual player.

614
00:35:29,591 --> 00:35:35,790
Rym: And I can't impress upon you enough how much of a gaming revolution that was.

615
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:40,590
Scott: I mean, you know, you could play Goldeneye, which is nothing secret.

616
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,330
Scott: It's just a four way split screen.

617
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:42,674
Scott: Right.

618
00:35:43,098 --> 00:35:44,250
Scott: You could play Counter Strike.

619
00:35:44,632 --> 00:35:46,409
Scott: Everyone has their own private screen.

620
00:35:46,891 --> 00:35:54,462
Scott: But what this is, is there's a public screen and everyone has a private screen and they could do this with the way the DS connects to the way.

621
00:35:54,482 --> 00:35:56,828
Scott: there's no reason they couldn't make four swords.

622
00:35:56,951 --> 00:35:58,570
Scott: We or even eight swords.

623
00:35:59,011 --> 00:36:02,810
Scott: We right where you have eight DS's that have two private screens.

624
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:05,290
Scott: And then there's the one big public screen.

625
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,468
Scott: They could totally do it.

626
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,252
Rym: They just don't.

627
00:36:07,493 --> 00:36:11,890
Rym: They could even with the GBA or not the GBA, the DS, it has two screens.

628
00:36:12,151 --> 00:36:16,189
Rym: You could have just made Crystal Chronicles where everyone shares the top screen for private bottom screen.

629
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:21,390
Scott: Well, there are co-op games for the DS's together, but they're all terrible.

630
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:30,310
Rym: Like I think the example was Crystal Chronicles on the DS, which basically poke much like smooth moves or, you know, every other warrior or other than the GameCube one.

631
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:38,149
Rym: They they took the parts of the game that were not worthwhile and enhance them and they got rid of the only part of the game we liked.

632
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:39,232
Scott: Right.

633
00:36:39,634 --> 00:36:41,140
Rym: But I don't want to talk about.

634
00:36:41,422 --> 00:36:43,310
Rym: I want to talk specifically about four.

635
00:36:43,611 --> 00:36:45,690
Scott: So well, four swords, actually, right.

636
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:49,570
Scott: People I don't know how many people realize this, you know, who aren't Nintendo fans.

637
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:49,912
Scott: Right.

638
00:36:50,354 --> 00:36:53,710
Scott: But Super Nintendo Zelda, which is what linked to the past.

639
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:54,292
Rym: Yep.

640
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:59,610
Scott: Zelda three Zelda three linked to the past was re-released for the Game Boy Advance.

641
00:36:59,852 --> 00:37:00,054
Scott: Right.

642
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:01,650
Scott: So it had come out for the Super Nintendo.

643
00:37:01,851 --> 00:37:07,698
Scott: But by the time the GBA came out, a lot of people had not played it and the GBA was capable of playing it.

644
00:37:07,718 --> 00:37:09,190
Scott: So they re-released it for the GBA.

645
00:37:09,772 --> 00:37:13,450
Scott: And when they did re-release it for the GBA, they added a dungeon to it.

646
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,350
Scott: The hero's dungeon or the colored or whatever they called it.

647
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,574
Scott: Right.

648
00:37:17,594 --> 00:37:21,410
Scott: And they also added to it four swords, the original four swords.

649
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:26,993
Scott: And the way that would work is you get four GBAs and you would connect them with the GBA link cables.

650
00:37:27,054 --> 00:37:27,275
Scott: Right.

651
00:37:27,295 --> 00:37:30,670
Scott: So you needed three GBA link cables, four GBAs.

652
00:37:31,191 --> 00:37:37,732
Scott: And I don't know, I think I forget if you needed one or four cartridges, but and you hooked it up.

653
00:37:38,474 --> 00:37:51,567
Scott: And then if you had that all set up, you could play four swords, which is a you know, the thing is that original four swords right for that GBA did not have that shared screen.

654
00:37:51,628 --> 00:37:51,770
Scott: Right.

655
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,170
Scott: Everyone only had their one GBA screen.

656
00:37:54,751 --> 00:38:03,851
Scott: So what you did is you just sort of were playing Zelda and there were three other people on the screen with you, you know, a red link, a green link, a magenta link and a blue link.

657
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:10,769
Rym: And, you know, it was a pretty good game, but it wasn't quite there yet because the shared space really adds a lot.

658
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:11,803
Scott: Yeah.

659
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:11,904
Scott: Yeah.

660
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:18,173
Rym: It's also the problem that we have an old beautiful picture of us trying to use the GBA link cables.

661
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:21,530
Rym: They were not long enough, nor were they fast enough.

662
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:32,809
Scott: I mean, we played Mario Kart Super Circuit with them a few times and Advance Wars with them and you sort of everyone had to huddle together and the connection would inevitably be lost in a long game of Advance Wars and you go, fuck.

663
00:38:33,473 --> 00:38:34,449
Scott: And that was that.

664
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:34,931
Rym: Yep.

665
00:38:35,152 --> 00:38:41,950
Rym: Also, I should point out, just, you know, while we're talking, the Dreamcast was close to this because it had that little screen on the controller.

666
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,350
Scott: Well, no, it wasn't on the controller.

667
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:44,550
Scott: It was on the memory card.

668
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,317
Rym: Well, that's even better.

669
00:38:45,337 --> 00:38:46,709
Rym: But you could put little stuff there.

670
00:38:47,071 --> 00:38:55,510
Scott: Well, the interesting thing about the Dreamcast VMU, right, is like, you know, let's say there was a. there was never a Pokemon for the Dreamcast, but I guess there was Monster Rancher, if I'm not mistaken.

671
00:38:56,191 --> 00:38:58,770
Scott: And, you know, you would play it on the big screen.

672
00:38:59,251 --> 00:38:59,492
Scott: Right.

673
00:38:59,593 --> 00:39:02,610
Scott: And while you were playing, there might be stuff on your little screen.

674
00:39:03,252 --> 00:39:03,454
Scott: Right.

675
00:39:03,535 --> 00:39:04,890
Scott: Which was also your memory card.

676
00:39:05,171 --> 00:39:09,533
Scott: And then you would take that memory card out and the memory card actually had a D-pad and two buttons on it.

677
00:39:10,156 --> 00:39:13,952
Scott: And it would only had a crappy little shitty Tiger LCD type of display.

678
00:39:13,972 --> 00:39:23,351
Scott: But you could like, you know, train your little monsters on there and play your little tiny games on there, just carry your memory card around with you, which is sort of neat.

679
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:28,370
Rym: But with four swords specifically, it's a game.

680
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:35,637
Rym: It's just your four links and you play through a Super Nintendo Zelda game and you're all kind of on the same screen.

681
00:39:35,657 --> 00:39:39,290
Rym: But then you can kind of break apart and go to different dungeons, different holes and houses.

682
00:39:39,391 --> 00:39:41,230
Rym: And you just have to solve puzzles.

683
00:39:41,452 --> 00:39:44,010
Rym: And it's it's one of those brilliant games.

684
00:39:44,473 --> 00:39:46,510
Rym: I love games where you have a co-op goal.

685
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:50,810
Rym: You're all trying to do the same thing, but you also have this slightly competitive goal.

686
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:54,129
Rym: that doesn't really matter, but it ends up really mattering.

687
00:39:55,012 --> 00:39:55,976
Scott: Yeah, it's just sort of like.

688
00:39:56,077 --> 00:39:59,984
Scott: it doesn't matter for winning the game, but it just matters, you know, for fun.

689
00:40:00,247 --> 00:40:00,450
Scott: Right.

690
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:01,516
Scott: Because, I mean, think about this.

691
00:40:01,576 --> 00:40:01,737
Scott: Right.

692
00:40:01,757 --> 00:40:05,046
Scott: Let's say let's say the game didn't have the competitive aspect.

693
00:40:05,106 --> 00:40:05,330
Scott: Right.

694
00:40:05,852 --> 00:40:12,830
Scott: So the game would be sort of this march to the end of solving all the puzzles and everyone just rush forward, solving all the puzzles and then the game be over.

695
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:15,250
Scott: And that that would actually be a pretty damn good game.

696
00:40:15,571 --> 00:40:15,834
Scott: Right.

697
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:17,630
Scott: But this competitive aspect.

698
00:40:17,831 --> 00:40:18,032
Scott: Right.

699
00:40:18,173 --> 00:40:18,354
Scott: OK.

700
00:40:18,434 --> 00:40:21,710
Scott: So let's say you beat a boss instead of just going, yeah, we beat the boss.

701
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:22,423
Scott: High fives.

702
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:22,690
Scott: Right.

703
00:40:23,773 --> 00:40:25,389
Scott: All these gems fall from the sky.

704
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:29,265
Scott: So everyone starts running around trying to pick up more than everyone else.

705
00:40:30,068 --> 00:40:31,910
Rym: or the classic moment that happened.

706
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,750
Rym: We were playing, you know, the other night and we just beat the stage.

707
00:40:34,951 --> 00:40:37,650
Rym: And I had like a thousand more force gems than everyone.

708
00:40:38,332 --> 00:40:42,658
Rym: And I also had the bombs and I also had half of a heart left because I was throwing bombs at the boss.

709
00:40:42,759 --> 00:40:43,669
Rym: I messed up a couple of times.

710
00:40:44,492 --> 00:40:47,130
Rym: We're going to stand on the end and I, you know, we're done.

711
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:58,228
Rym: I stand on the little teleporter thing and just before someone else stands there, I accidentally hit A and didn't notice there's a bomb behind me and it blew up and I died and all my force gems fell out.

712
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:02,229
Rym: And Emily, Scott and Alex go, fuck, and they grab them all.

713
00:41:02,571 --> 00:41:03,112
Scott: Yeah.

714
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,250
Rym: And that wouldn't happen if you weren't competing over these force gems.

715
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:11,245
Rym: And even though you don't get anything out of it, really, it did.

716
00:41:11,466 --> 00:41:19,170
Rym: that little bit of competitiveness causes like it causes the game to be great where you're always trying to rush ahead and solve the puzzle before everyone else.

717
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:19,914
Rym: And that ended it up.

718
00:41:20,297 --> 00:41:22,110
Rym: But then you all run in four different directions.

719
00:41:22,491 --> 00:41:27,790
Rym: But then someone gets to a spot where they need another person to help them and you've got to go and throw him over.

720
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:29,949
Rym: But you see that gem there and you don't want to do it.

721
00:41:30,391 --> 00:41:33,344
Rym: But then the game screws him and you get the gem and all that sort of.

722
00:41:33,846 --> 00:41:39,530
Rym: there's so much just like exploratory fun in four swords that it's a fantastic game as a result.

723
00:41:40,611 --> 00:41:49,110
Scott: I mean, yeah, I think about like, you know, the game doesn't have, you know, finding items, right, because the items just sort of sitting on these little pedestals.

724
00:41:49,191 --> 00:41:49,312
Scott: Right.

725
00:41:49,332 --> 00:41:50,790
Scott: So you can always get them when you need them.

726
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:51,212
Scott: Right.

727
00:41:52,518 --> 00:41:55,090
Scott: And it doesn't have shops to buy anything with rupees.

728
00:41:55,591 --> 00:41:55,892
Scott: Right.

729
00:41:56,254 --> 00:41:57,882
Scott: So really the only kind of item.

730
00:41:57,902 --> 00:42:01,950
Scott: they and, you know, and all the all the weapons have unlimited ammos, never run out of arrows or anything.

731
00:42:02,571 --> 00:42:05,130
Scott: So what could they really give you when you stab enemies?

732
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,409
Scott: What are you supposed to drop hearts?

733
00:42:06,871 --> 00:42:09,950
Scott: If they only drop hearts, you're going to be invincible, basically.

734
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,237
Scott: And you are sort of invincible.

735
00:42:11,257 --> 00:42:13,410
Scott: I mean, you can die, but it's hard to die.

736
00:42:13,894 --> 00:42:15,109
Scott: So what could they really give you?

737
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:21,194
Scott: So they give you these force gems and, you know, you start, you know, and but what do you.

738
00:42:21,295 --> 00:42:22,450
Scott: OK, so they give you force gems.

739
00:42:23,053 --> 00:42:24,024
Scott: What do you want them for?

740
00:42:24,085 --> 00:42:24,530
Scott: What do you care?

741
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,190
Scott: You can't buy anything with them, right?

742
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:37,375
Scott: What you get with them is you get the satisfaction of, yeah, it took all of us together to beat this level, but really, I'm better than all of you at this and I'm carrying it all the way.

743
00:42:37,435 --> 00:42:41,053
Scott: And it's sort of, you know, it gives you that extra good feeling of like.

744
00:42:41,113 --> 00:42:47,510
Scott: not only did we solve this puzzle together, but I'm actually, you know, the real go to guy here.

745
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:52,430
Rym: You guys are just sort of hangers on having the shared space and the non shared space.

746
00:42:52,771 --> 00:43:00,812
Rym: Like two good examples of why that's so great is one, oftentimes like you'll be all on the screen together and you can see everyone there and someone finds a little hidey hole.

747
00:43:01,093 --> 00:43:07,290
Rym: So you run in and now you're on your GBA by yourself and you're like running ahead to get all the treasures before other people get them.

748
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,469
Rym: And there's this mad rush and it's usually really fun.

749
00:43:09,911 --> 00:43:10,152
Scott: Yeah.

750
00:43:10,232 --> 00:43:18,390
Scott: It's like if you go into, say, a house or a cave or something like that, you know, people can only see you when you're on the big screen in the overworld.

751
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:21,830
Scott: If you go into something, you're on your own little GBA screen.

752
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:25,733
Scott: People can't see you unless they're in the same place, you know, like if they also go in the house.

753
00:43:26,255 --> 00:43:29,030
Scott: So you go in the house and you start getting treasures.

754
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:31,970
Scott: No one's seeing you getting these treasures like.

755
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:37,445
Rym: But number two, the shared space and the private space.

756
00:43:37,505 --> 00:43:43,973
Rym: at the end of every round, you have that vote where you secretly get to vote someone up and someone down in the final tally.

757
00:43:44,437 --> 00:43:46,230
Scott: And you like Rym was really helpful.

758
00:43:46,371 --> 00:43:50,712
Scott: And you can't vote for yourself and be like, Alex, he was really a pain in the ass this level.

759
00:43:50,733 --> 00:43:50,874
Scott: Yeah.

760
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:53,149
Rym: He set me on fire like four times that jerk.

761
00:43:53,791 --> 00:43:53,932
Scott: Yeah.

762
00:43:53,973 --> 00:43:54,778
Scott: That's something else.

763
00:43:54,818 --> 00:43:55,523
Scott: is that you have all these.

764
00:43:55,623 --> 00:43:56,630
Scott: you get these weapons, right?

765
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:57,695
Scott: And the sword is the sword.

766
00:43:58,117 --> 00:44:01,273
Scott: But the way that you can interact with the other links, right?

767
00:44:01,313 --> 00:44:01,596
Scott: You can.

768
00:44:01,717 --> 00:44:02,970
Scott: you can stab them, I guess.

769
00:44:03,112 --> 00:44:03,316
Scott: Right.

770
00:44:03,336 --> 00:44:04,029
Scott: It doesn't do much.

771
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:07,610
Rym: The only way you can damage anyone really is with Bob.

772
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,629
Scott: Well, you can you could throw them into a hole.

773
00:44:09,891 --> 00:44:10,132
Rym: Yep.

774
00:44:10,594 --> 00:44:16,910
Rym: The fact that the game lets you pick people up and throw them around and call all you need to throw people around to throw them over holes.

775
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:17,295
Rym: Yes.

776
00:44:17,538 --> 00:44:18,409
Scott: But to get stuff.

777
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:23,949
Rym: But you are often, often tempted to pick someone up and throw them into a hole so you can get the force jammies.

778
00:44:24,251 --> 00:44:24,533
Rym: Yep.

779
00:44:24,855 --> 00:44:25,701
Scott: You can also.

780
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:26,930
Scott: there's the fire rod.

781
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:30,169
Scott: You can set people on fire, which is a pain in the ass.

782
00:44:30,612 --> 00:44:32,470
Rym: It doesn't do any damage, but it's hilarious.

783
00:44:33,372 --> 00:44:34,016
Rym: Oh, my God.

784
00:44:34,036 --> 00:44:36,170
Scott: And it's incredibly frustrating because once you're set out.

785
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:36,551
Scott: Right.

786
00:44:36,692 --> 00:44:47,831
Scott: So you think you always want the fire rod because then you you're the guy who's setting everyone else on fire and you're just getting up, even if you're trying to be good and you're not me, you're just going to start accidentally setting someone on fire one.

787
00:44:47,871 --> 00:44:51,250
Scott: And then once they're on fire, if they touch you, you're on fire.

788
00:44:51,371 --> 00:44:54,910
Scott: So the force, you know, the fire rod is not like some ha ha ha.

789
00:44:55,011 --> 00:44:56,490
Scott: I can torture all the other players.

790
00:44:57,052 --> 00:45:00,190
Scott: If you torture someone with it, they can torture you back by touching you.

791
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:01,150
Scott: You have to run away.

792
00:45:01,352 --> 00:45:03,070
Rym: And then at the end of the round, they're on fire.

793
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:04,008
Rym: They run real fast.

794
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:07,189
Rym: The question is usually, hey, who had the fire rod?

795
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:11,250
Scott: Yeah, it's like both someone down Rym set everyone on fire.

796
00:45:11,331 --> 00:45:12,429
Scott: Let's vote Rym down.

797
00:45:12,611 --> 00:45:16,290
Rym: Of course, in terms of griefing, nothing beats the mega bomb.

798
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:27,348
Rym: Yeah, that pretty much we 10 minutes would go by where someone gets the mega bomb and they're holding everyone hostage by just putting it in the middle of the screen and hiding and then putting it in the middle of the screen and hiding.

799
00:45:29,171 --> 00:45:34,131
Rym: But there's the fact that you vote secretly and then you can't actually see who voted for whom.

800
00:45:34,513 --> 00:45:37,990
Rym: But you can see what the votes were in the end.

801
00:45:38,171 --> 00:45:41,250
Rym: And it adds this subtle bit of rivalry and fun.

802
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:42,558
Scott: And it's like you'll get.

803
00:45:42,598 --> 00:45:44,370
Scott: you'll see that you got voted down twice.

804
00:45:44,511 --> 00:45:46,661
Scott: You don't know who, but you know that you were.

805
00:45:46,701 --> 00:45:48,934
Scott: two of the three other players voted you down.

806
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,190
Scott: You're like, fuck you guys.

807
00:45:50,332 --> 00:45:51,389
Scott: I was doing a good job.

808
00:45:51,971 --> 00:45:54,902
Rym: And the game has all these non like.

809
00:45:54,922 --> 00:46:09,068
Rym: they're not directly tied to winning or losing, but they're all these meta elements and all these kind of tertiary, enjoyable elements that make the four swords experience a fantastic game experience that is unlike almost anything else out there.

810
00:46:09,832 --> 00:46:11,330
Rym: There aren't other games like this.

811
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:12,970
Rym: There aren't other experiences like this.

812
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:23,151
Rym: If you can get three friends together and sit down with GBAs and play this game all the way through, there are few experiences that you will ever have in gaming even close to it.

813
00:46:23,171 --> 00:46:29,709
Scott: Yeah, I can't even think of any other game that, like, has anything remotely similar to the kind of experience you get with four swords.

814
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:30,571
Scott: Not one.

815
00:46:30,592 --> 00:46:39,083
Rym: I mean, Crystal Chronicles and like Pac-Man versus have similar types of shared experiences, but Crystal Chronicles is the closest.

816
00:46:39,143 --> 00:46:40,670
Scott: Pac-Man first comes after that.

817
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:41,775
Rym: But even then, they're still.

818
00:46:41,815 --> 00:46:49,792
Rym: they're so unique in their own ways and they showcase this kind of abandoned avenue, kind of like how people say that the point and click adventures kind of died.

819
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:55,610
Rym: There were this as the genre of gaming that just kind of petered out and is dead and people are trying to bring it back.

820
00:46:55,690 --> 00:47:01,189
Rym: But it's tough and whole genres of gaming fall out of favor and disappear and people get so locked into.

821
00:47:01,776 --> 00:47:02,508
Rym: Is it an RPG?

822
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:07,170
Scott: These are really, you know, four swords isn't really a different genre.

823
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:08,242
Scott: It's an action RPG.

824
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:11,770
Scott: It's not even really an action RPG because there's not much RPG.

825
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:13,230
Rym: This is even more of a crime.

826
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:15,970
Scott: It is a it's really a top down action puzzler.

827
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:30,470
Rym: It is a gaming technology that failed and disappeared and was effectively stillborn because the controls, the setup, the Gameboy GBA controller connection to the GameCube was not really ready yet.

828
00:47:30,591 --> 00:47:32,030
Rym: It was almost a tech demo.

829
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:34,569
Rym: It was basically Nintendo saying, look at this.

830
00:47:34,992 --> 00:47:36,110
Rym: No one's ever done this before.

831
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:42,555
Rym: Effectively, this is a new avenue of gaming and you can have unique gaming experiences with this.

832
00:47:43,302 --> 00:47:44,230
Rym: And no one gave a shit.

833
00:47:44,534 --> 00:47:45,450
Rym: And Nintendo said, you know what?

834
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:46,094
Rym: Never mind.

835
00:47:46,357 --> 00:47:47,950
Rym: We're going to make games for old people now.

836
00:47:48,292 --> 00:47:48,574
Scott: Yep.

837
00:47:48,837 --> 00:47:50,190
Scott: And that's what they've done.

838
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:54,653
Scott: I mean, you know, with the GameCube, people complain that releases were few and far between.

839
00:47:54,693 --> 00:47:56,970
Scott: They didn't come out with new, awesome games often enough.

840
00:47:57,051 --> 00:47:58,289
Scott: And that's sort of true.

841
00:47:58,892 --> 00:48:07,830
Scott: But every every year there would be three or four games that were like, oh, yeah, but I mean, Soul Calibur two, F zero, Crystal Chronicles.

842
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:10,059
Scott: So what would happen with the GameCube?

843
00:48:10,099 --> 00:48:14,130
Scott: as we turn it on and play it like crazy for like a month or so, then we turn it off.

844
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:16,689
Scott: But we played if someone came over for a party, but it would be off.

845
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:18,770
Scott: Then another game would come out and you play it like crazy.

846
00:48:19,212 --> 00:48:21,250
Scott: The Wii that was happening for a little while.

847
00:48:21,492 --> 00:48:21,695
Scott: Right.

848
00:48:21,715 --> 00:48:22,587
Scott: You know, we got it.

849
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:23,798
Scott: We played it like crazy.

850
00:48:24,444 --> 00:48:24,969
Scott: Turned it off.

851
00:48:25,331 --> 00:48:25,917
Scott: We got nothing.

852
00:48:25,937 --> 00:48:27,170
Scott: We got like Smash Brothers.

853
00:48:27,231 --> 00:48:28,162
Scott: We played it like crazy.

854
00:48:28,304 --> 00:48:28,750
Scott: Turned it off.

855
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:29,051
Rym: Right.

856
00:48:29,071 --> 00:48:32,190
Rym: Part of the problem is that with the Wii, the shared experience thing came back.

857
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:38,129
Rym: I mean, playing Wii Sports and all these things with a group of people was a similar new, unique kind of game experience.

858
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:45,408
Rym: The problem was after they made that experience, they didn't improve upon it and they didn't go anywhere with it.

859
00:48:45,851 --> 00:48:46,072
Scott: Yeah.

860
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:51,807
Scott: I mean, even look at the Wii games that are coming out now are not really doing any of that stuff at all.

861
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:57,130
Scott: And I mean, the last Wii game I bought that was at all exciting was like the Wario game.

862
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:01,110
Scott: Which was a 2D side scroller with a little bit of shaky controller business.

863
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:01,892
Scott: And that was it.

864
00:49:02,053 --> 00:49:12,392
Rym: But people basically they abandon the shared experience and went back to make a single player or two player game or a really weak four or a painfully weak eight player game.

865
00:49:12,995 --> 00:49:17,250
Rym: Add a little bit of waggle, but make it mostly a normal controller, two dimensional style game.

866
00:49:18,034 --> 00:49:19,750
Rym: I mean, look at the biggest games like Smash Brothers.

867
00:49:20,314 --> 00:49:21,910
Rym: It's just a GameCube game made better.

868
00:49:22,131 --> 00:49:23,709
Rym: It's not anything innovative or special.

869
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:24,816
Scott: Twilight Princess.

870
00:49:24,876 --> 00:49:26,330
Scott: People sort of forget this.

871
00:49:26,431 --> 00:49:28,030
Scott: It had a release on the GameCube.

872
00:49:28,873 --> 00:49:31,269
Scott: It came out for GameCube and for Wii.

873
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:35,550
Rym: It was not because they didn't do anything with the Wii controller.

874
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:41,452
Rym: The Wii controller is is more and more the waggle is becoming just like the GBA controller.

875
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:45,147
Scott: It was still like at first, at first, you know, it was.

876
00:49:45,188 --> 00:49:48,730
Scott: we thought it was going to be the revolution, you know, and it was called the revolution.

877
00:49:48,851 --> 00:49:51,350
Scott: And on paper, it was like, oh, yeah, this is the business.

878
00:49:51,511 --> 00:50:04,410
Scott: And playing bowling, the bowling is actually still pretty great until you get bored of it, you know, but really it did that, you know, I mean, the DS, the touch screen, people said the same thing, you know, that's gimmicky.

879
00:50:04,531 --> 00:50:06,730
Scott: But while it wasn't, the DS is still the business.

880
00:50:07,251 --> 00:50:12,430
Scott: But with the Wii, you know, I guess parts of the Wii, you know, are not gimmicky.

881
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:20,109
Rym: But I guess the trouble is the Wii is from a business perspective, possibly the most successful console ever.

882
00:50:20,452 --> 00:50:24,110
Rym: I mean, obviously, excluding the days when Nintendo had a monopoly on gaming.

883
00:50:24,452 --> 00:50:27,630
Scott: Who knows if the NES that we made more money, it's a tough call.

884
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:30,590
Rym: But the Wii is people say this all the time.

885
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:31,910
Rym: It's a license to print money.

886
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:35,030
Rym: Nintendo's Blue, Blue Ocean strategy was brilliant.

887
00:50:35,571 --> 00:50:38,890
Rym: Like, I cannot think of a better business direction for Nintendo to have gone.

888
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:40,215
Scott: Well, I mean, that's why.

889
00:50:40,295 --> 00:50:44,614
Scott: that's why those recent articles said Miyamoto was sad during the GameCube era.

890
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,302
Scott: They made this great thing in.

891
00:50:46,362 --> 00:50:48,617
Scott: Four Swords was like the greatest game experience.

892
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:49,850
Scott: that made no money.

893
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:50,613
Rym: It was new.

894
00:50:50,733 --> 00:50:54,070
Rym: It was equivalently new to when someone said, what if I made it?

895
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:58,529
Rym: I made a game from the first person perspective where you shot things.

896
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:00,221
Rym: Yeah, like it was it was.

897
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:01,310
Rym: it was on that order.

898
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:03,430
Rym: It was a new kind of gaming.

899
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:06,410
Rym: It was a fundamental shift, something that couldn't have been done before.

900
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:08,849
Rym: And no one cared.

901
00:51:09,671 --> 00:51:09,892
Scott: Yeah.

902
00:51:10,636 --> 00:51:14,332
Scott: I mean, there's other things about Four Swords, too, like that make it really cool.

903
00:51:14,392 --> 00:51:18,690
Rym: Like, well, there's Tingle's Tower and the bucking Broncos.

904
00:51:19,394 --> 00:51:19,596
Scott: Right.

905
00:51:19,637 --> 00:51:20,690
Scott: Well, we'll ignore that for now.

906
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:27,190
Rym: But I mean, sexual towers, they've only it is it is great and how horrifying it is.

907
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:29,402
Scott: I mean, there are just some things in that game like there'll be.

908
00:51:29,422 --> 00:51:37,710
Scott: there'll be scenes where you walk onto a mat onto the next screen and like a million bad guys will come at you like a whole bunch, like a hundred soldiers.

909
00:51:37,893 --> 00:51:38,990
Scott: And it's like, oh, it's pretty cool.

910
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:41,510
Rym: The thing is, the game, what it did is it has these concepts.

911
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:45,403
Rym: It's a pretty simple game, but it keeps it fresh by surprising you.

912
00:51:45,443 --> 00:51:55,412
Rym: that Four Swords surprised me many times during the course of playing it in ways that very few games have since then.

913
00:51:55,814 --> 00:52:01,450
Rym: Like, and they'll do subtle little things like you'll be playing, you'll be going around doing stuff and you find a room with a puzzle.

914
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:04,169
Rym: But there was another room somewhere else with the puzzle you didn't do.

915
00:52:04,691 --> 00:52:14,549
Rym: And if you do this, this easy puzzle first without doing the other one, you solve it and a million million force gems fall from the sky into a pit in the middle of the room.

916
00:52:15,491 --> 00:52:27,350
Rym: And you just stand there and watch this and they don't overuse that, but they use their little moments like that, moments where you go, oh, they really they really took.

917
00:52:29,298 --> 00:52:30,527
Scott: I mean, and it's just 2D Zelda.

918
00:52:30,991 --> 00:52:31,111
Scott: Right.

919
00:52:31,131 --> 00:52:37,310
Scott: And you think, what could they possibly do with 2D Zelda that they didn't already do in the Game Boy games or the SNES game?

920
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:37,612
Scott: Right.

921
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:41,150
Scott: Well, look at like the search, the searchlight part of the game.

922
00:52:41,331 --> 00:52:45,772
Rym: Oh, my God, that is brilliant and and one of the most frustrating things I've ever experienced.

923
00:52:45,852 --> 00:52:53,830
Scott: or the mystery forest or, you know, every level in the game is not just walk around with pushing block puzzles and stabbing bad guys.

924
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:58,727
Scott: Every level has this really unique and interesting shit going on.

925
00:52:58,767 --> 00:53:01,530
Scott: that is just not happening, even in any other Zelda game.

926
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:07,609
Rym: And in every puzzle all the time and more and more, they always give you the ability to fuck with the other players.

927
00:53:08,212 --> 00:53:15,289
Rym: Case in point, there's a couple of places where everyone else is going inside some cave to do stuff, but it's dark in there.

928
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:17,090
Rym: But there's a skylight.

929
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:21,409
Rym: So one person stands outside on the switch to keep the skylight open so people can see.

930
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:27,569
Rym: But nothing is more satisfying than stepping off of that switch and having your three friends go, what the fuck?

931
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:31,042
Scott: Seriously, you know, that's good times.

932
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:37,450
Rym: So I guess the moral here, we've talked about four swords off and on.

933
00:53:38,433 --> 00:53:47,189
Rym: If you have not played four swords all the way through with three other people, I mean, you can or the way you can play the game on your own.

934
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:49,076
Scott: Don't that's that's.

935
00:53:49,357 --> 00:53:53,243
Scott: I mean, you know, it's kind of fun because it's still a really good 2D Zelda game.

936
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:55,330
Rym: But the thing is, you're defeating the purpose.

937
00:53:55,657 --> 00:53:56,330
Rym: It's a good game.

938
00:53:56,390 --> 00:54:05,606
Scott: If you do that, unlike Crystal Chronicles, which is if you really if you really don't have enough friends and enough GBAs, then do that anyway, just because, you know, it's worth it.

939
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:14,429
Scott: But if you can, in any circumstance, get it on with the four GBAs and the four cables, then you really have to.

940
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:19,502
Rym: Well, because if you don't play it with, you know, the full four people and the full, you know, the way the game was, you could do three people.

941
00:54:19,582 --> 00:54:20,509
Scott: also, you know, it's yeah.

942
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:21,312
Rym: But what?

943
00:54:21,512 --> 00:54:28,790
Rym: what you're missing, if you play it by yourself, is all the things that make this a unique gaming experience as opposed to just a good gaming experience.

944
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:30,630
Rym: I mean, there's good and there's unique.

945
00:54:31,051 --> 00:54:32,250
Rym: Sometimes there's uniquely good.

946
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:33,729
Rym: Sometimes there's uniquely bad.

947
00:54:33,982 --> 00:54:34,088
Scott: Yeah.

948
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:40,769
Scott: Also, also, if you play it alone, the game is actually a little bit frustrating and that you have to keep switching between the different links.

949
00:54:41,291 --> 00:54:49,430
Scott: So it's like you're playing this frustrating game as opposed to a sort of a fun, happy game, you know, but play four swords and play Crystal Chronicles.

950
00:54:49,551 --> 00:54:52,310
Rym: But only if you can play them the way they were meant to be played.

951
00:54:52,631 --> 00:54:54,008
Rym: Be what you were meant to be.

952
00:54:54,297 --> 00:54:54,490
Scott: Yeah.

953
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:59,729
Scott: And, you know, one of the original complaints was that, you know, hey, it's expensive to get all this stuff.

954
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:00,469
Scott: Well, guess what?

955
00:55:00,913 --> 00:55:02,209
Scott: How many years later is it now?

956
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:05,943
Scott: Like three, four years later, you've got like you can get.

957
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:11,770
Scott: you can get GBAs and cables in the game and you get game cubes or, you know, you could play it on your Wii.

958
00:55:11,958 --> 00:55:12,150
Scott: Right.

959
00:55:12,511 --> 00:55:15,970
Scott: You can get all this stuff really cheap now, really cheap.

960
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:22,889
Scott: So, you know, I mean, compare this to something like like getting a whole bunch of plastic instruments.

961
00:55:22,971 --> 00:55:23,366
Scott: Right.

962
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:25,550
Scott: No one complained about the expensive plastic instruments.

963
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:30,070
Scott: No one complained about the expensive price of that steel battalion for the Xbox.

964
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:30,279
Scott: Right.

965
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,809
Scott: So this is cheaper than that.

966
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:33,905
Scott: So you should do it.

967
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:42,390
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

968
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:44,990
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

971
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:05,230
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

972

Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games and RPGs.

973
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:13,789
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

981
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:55,670
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
