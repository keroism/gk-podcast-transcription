1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,608
Rym: It's Wednesday, December 14th, 2016.

2
00:00:10,608 --> 00:00:10,929
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,121 --> 00:00:14,879
Emily: And I'm Emily.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,860
Rym: And this is GeekNights tonight.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,417
Rym: Because Scott's a little baby who won't watch movies that came out within the last 40 or 50 years.

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,020
Rym: Emily and I saw Moana and we're reviewing that.

7
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:36,690
Rym: So for any of you who back us on the Patreon, this is Emily and I semi-regularly review all the stuff we watch and do that Scott just won't consume.

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,230
Rym: Like he hasn't seen Zootopia, he hasn't even seen Mad Max actually.

9
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,130
Emily: Yeah, I feel like when you recommend stuff, we're like, "Scott, you need to see this movie.

10
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,161
Emily: We saw it without you.

11
00:00:46,222 --> 00:00:46,769
Emily: You should go see

12
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:46,870
Emily: it.".

13
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:47,435
Emily: He's like, "No.

14
00:00:47,718 --> 00:00:48,849
Emily: No, I don't want

15
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:48,930
Emily: to.".

16
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:49,628
Rym: Watch my hurry.

17
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:54,530
Emily: But it's definitely movie season in our group of friends.

18
00:00:55,311 --> 00:01:01,659
Emily: And part of the reason we've been seeing a lot of movies lately is Judith and Natalie were like, "Eh, let's go see Dr.

19
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:02,182
Emily: Strange.

20
00:01:02,222 --> 00:01:02,745
Emily: Let's go see

21
00:01:02,766 --> 00:01:03,188
Emily: Moana.".

22
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:09,190
Rym: Well, she needed to see the movie so she wouldn't feel conflicted about selling fan art about the movie.

23
00:01:09,572 --> 00:01:10,779
Emily: It's research, right?

24
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:12,006
Emily: It's like, "Let's do

25
00:01:12,087 --> 00:01:12,550
Emily: research.".

26
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:23,769
Rym: So normally these are just on the Patreon for the GeekNights Patreon patrons right up there with Rims Rants where I talk about stuff like how I cut my finger open in the dumbest possible way the other day.

27
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,910
Emily: Oh no, did you do a Rims Rant about entering your finger?

28
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,411
Rym: Of course I did.

29
00:01:27,431 --> 00:01:32,690
Rym: There are 17 Rims Rants and like 7 or 8 Rimmly reviews and this one is public.

30
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,222
Rym: But the one we're going to record pretty soon on Dr.

31
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:36,690
Rym: Strange will be back on the Patreon.

32
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,290
Rym: So if you support GeekNights on Patreon for even $1, you get all that, not just GeekNights.

33
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,609
Emily: You're really selling it here.

34
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:45,970
Rym: Hey, I got a few more pledges recently.

35
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:54,990
Emily: One of the things that's interesting, I used to be kind of like peeved when I do shows with just you and I because you'd never want to do Thing of the Day and you'd never want to do news.

36
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,681
Rym: You want to do the whole format?

37
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:58,030
Rym: You got to start with the opening event.

38
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:01,810
Rym: Then you need to have two main newses and one small news.

39
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,150
Emily: See, I always have a backlog of Things of the Day.

40
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,870
Emily: I mean, they're not usually things I found that day because I don't really browse the internet a lot at work.

41
00:02:09,354 --> 00:02:10,050
Emily: I'm busy animating.

42
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:12,690
Emily: But like I have all this backlog of shorts.

43
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,109
Emily: I've got like this YouTube playlist that I can pull from.

44
00:02:16,212 --> 00:02:29,350
Emily: But anyway, it's kind of grown on me that since you and I have a different style when we do the show together, it's like instead of following the Rym and Scott format exactly, the Rym and Emily formats a little bit more loose.

45
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:32,707
Emily: We don't necessarily have to be like, "What happened

46
00:02:32,747 --> 00:02:33,110
Emily: today?".

47
00:02:34,098 --> 00:02:35,148
Rym: I cut my finger open.

48
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:42,870
Emily: The other good thing about that is that we can take those reviews and put them anytime we want.

49
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:48,290
Emily: So like if we go on vacation, we can queue up a bunch of episodes and they're not specifically topical.

50
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,949
Rym: My hot take is Moana was super good and you should go see it.

51
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:52,748
Emily: What's that hot take?

52
00:02:55,573 --> 00:02:58,410
Rym: It's the second best Disney movie in modern history.

53
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,830
Emily: That's like, that's not negative at all.

54
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,490
Rym: Hot take doesn't have to necessarily be negative.

55
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:04,568
Emily: It just means it's hot.

56
00:03:04,913 --> 00:03:05,548
Rym: Hot off the press.

57
00:03:06,712 --> 00:03:09,250
Rym: Usually, ironically, like hot take.

58
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,509
Rym: Twitter has some issues.

59
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:18,710
Emily: Yeah, I usually hear it used in the context of saying something vaguely snarky about a piece of media.

60
00:03:20,153 --> 00:03:25,290
Rym: So when I was pulling up the stuff for this, the IMDb has a pretty good rating for Moana so far.

61
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:37,848
Rym: But the first and featured review is someone who gave it 5 out of 10. and they're like, "The beginning reminded me of Pocahontas, but Pocahontas was a rich tapestry that drew me into this amazing

62
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:38,249
Rym: world.".

63
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:41,790
Rym: And Moana was just like a dumb, boring rehash of that.

64
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:42,579
Emily: Are you serious?

65
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:43,349
Emily: It had nothing.

66
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,530
Emily: You know, like Avatar was like Pocahontas, right?

67
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:49,070
Emily: This was not like Pocahontas at all.

68
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:55,089
Rym: They go on to complain that Moana is bad because it's diverse and Disney's trying to be diverse instead of "telling good

69
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:55,410
Rym: stories.".

70
00:03:55,654 --> 00:03:56,024
Emily: Oh, wow.

71
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,250
Rym: That is the top review on IMDb right now.

72
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:12,829
Emily: Well, the thing is, I mean, with a movie like this, which takes very heavily from a specific culture's mythology and aesthetic and everything, I think there's definitely going to be a lot of criticism revolving around that.

73
00:04:13,311 --> 00:04:25,750
Emily: Specifically, I've read a few reviews by scholars of Polynesian studies about what the movie got right, what the movie was kind of eh about, what made them mad, what made them happy.

74
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,030
Rym: It seems like the consensus was more positive than negative.

75
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:37,424
Emily: Yeah, actually, on the internet, I've seen some people of Polynesian descent be like, "Oh my god, it was fucking awesome to see my heritage

76
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:38,147
Emily: represented.".

77
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:44,410
Emily: And the whole big theme behind the movie is about Polynesian migration.

78
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:46,010
Rym: And the great pause.

79
00:04:46,473 --> 00:04:46,890
Emily: The great pause.

80
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:54,170
Emily: Polynesian culture spread throughout the Pacific for like a thousand years and then it stopped.

81
00:04:54,730 --> 00:05:04,630
Rym: I remember with navigation techniques and shipwright techniques that basically were not known to the rest of the world for countless, not millennia, but countless centuries.

82
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:19,530
Emily: Yeah, it's like expert sailing culture who had incredible knowledge of the stars and of wayfinding techniques and stuff like that, and built canoes that were fast and very light and versatile.

83
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:28,410
Emily: And they were able to go throughout the entire ocean pretty much, like from New Zealand to Hawaii to just all these different islands.

84
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:33,510
Emily: And then evidence of that kind of disappeared for a while and then it started up again.

85
00:05:33,691 --> 00:05:38,070
Emily: And to this day, there's a lot of theories, but nobody really knows why that happened.

86
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:38,677
Emily: Well, I saw the movie.

87
00:05:38,697 --> 00:05:39,850
Rym: I know exactly what happened.

88
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:48,090
Emily: Because there was a girl and she had to break the magic spell that was causing the fish to die, so she found a demigod.

89
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:54,037
Emily: But that, just in general, it definitely was kind of like Kubo.

90
00:05:54,238 --> 00:06:09,790
Emily: in that I feel like even if the movie wasn't necessarily perfect on the front of cultural representation, Disney at least did its due diligence, and so it doesn't smack of appropriation quite as much as some of their earlier efforts.

91
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:20,325
Emily: Because Disney is like, you know, you want to talk about taking a culture and then dressing it up in like, "Okay, now we're going to make a musical with this culture as the

92
00:06:20,386 --> 00:06:20,807
Emily: setting.".

93
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:26,250
Emily: And it's not always the most authentic or respectful, perhaps.

94
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:28,409
Emily: I'm looking at you, Aladdin.

95
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,702
Rym: Yeah, Aladdin.

96
00:06:30,742 --> 00:06:31,570
Rym: Snarky teen.

97
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:42,330
Emily: Yeah, but I mean, Moana definitely, it felt like they were trying to put their effort in to represent Polynesian culture well.

98
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:49,570
Emily: And at least in the island scenes, I really enjoyed all the different characters in the village and stuff.

99
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,047
Emily: I like the guy who was just like, "Are you sure we can't eat that

100
00:06:53,127 --> 00:06:53,489
Emily: chicken?".

101
00:06:54,954 --> 00:06:56,879
Rym: On that front, you brought up the chicken.

102
00:06:56,899 --> 00:07:00,890
Rym: I really appreciate the fact that that chicken does not talk.

103
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,950
Rym: There are no talking animals in this movie at all.

104
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:10,068
Rym: And the posters all show the chicken and the pig like, "Okay, there's going to be animal sidekicks like there always

105
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:10,289
Rym: are.".

106
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,230
Rym: The pig doesn't follow her into the ocean, and the chicken never says a word.

107
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,609
Rym: The animal sidekicks... Maybe other chickens can talk, but that one can't.

108
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:21,049
Emily: They're more like... Actually, Pocahontas was the same way.

109
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,170
Emily: You know, now that brought up Pocahontas and it's in my mind.

110
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,807
Rym: So, I'll admit something.

111
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:32,810
Rym: Despite having played the song from it on the Blue Horn a million times, I've never actually seen Pocahontas all the way through.

112
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:33,115
Rym: Really?

113
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:41,450
Rym: I saw The Colors of the Wind, I saw the songs, and I just felt like that movie was not for me.

114
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:46,630
Emily: It's kind of a bastardization of history, and it's basically Romeo and Juliet.

115
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:52,770
Emily: Like, hot Indian lady, and John Smith is like this romance novel-looking dude.

116
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,010
Emily: And they had this...

117
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,010
Rym: You mean that she didn't actually marry because she married that other John?

118
00:07:56,132 --> 00:07:57,407
Emily: She was like 12 years old.

119
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,263
Rym: John Rolfe.

120
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:04,890
Emily: Yeah, and I mean, actually, I think they made a sequel where she meets John Rolfe or something.

121
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:07,669
Emily: But I don't think she dies so smallpox in that one.

122
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:08,544
Emily: Like...

123
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:09,768
Rym: If they did, it was made for TV.

124
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:20,188
Emily: I just remember my teacher... I took a class, it was like comparative director series, where they compared... The teacher was a huge Miyazaki scholar.

125
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,069
Emily: He loved the works of Hayao Miyazaki.

126
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,910
Emily: And he also really liked Disney.

127
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,750
Emily: So he did this animation history class comparing the two directors' styles.

128
00:08:29,954 --> 00:08:31,130
Emily: And he was a great teacher.

129
00:08:31,232 --> 00:08:31,669
Emily: I loved him.

130
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:39,429
Emily: But he was also of First Nations descent, and so he had some pretty choice words to say about the representation in Pocahontas.

131
00:08:40,072 --> 00:08:45,470
Emily: I remember, I didn't watch the movie in his class because I wanted to go to a concert or something.

132
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,886
Emily: And I said, "Can I skip the screening?

133
00:08:47,946 --> 00:08:48,148
Emily: Is that

134
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:48,450
Emily: okay?".

135
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:53,249
Emily: And he was like, "Most of the time I'd encourage you to go to the screening, but yeah, this one's a

136
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:53,410
Emily: mess.".

137
00:08:54,172 --> 00:08:54,598
Emily: I was like,

138
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,125
Emily: "Okay.".

139
00:08:56,311 --> 00:09:01,409
Rym: So since it's still in theaters, honestly, my short review is go see it in the theater in 3D.

140
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,423
Rym: It is designed, much like Mad Max, it is designed for 3D.

141
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,508
Rym: They put a lot of care into making the movie work very well in 3D.

142
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:16,070
Emily: Just really saturated colors, the environments are just phenomenal.

143
00:09:17,072 --> 00:09:22,270
Emily: There were many scenes in the movie where it was very simple and beautiful.

144
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,750
Emily: You know, like the scene with the stars.

145
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,029
Emily: Most of the movie takes place on a boat.

146
00:09:29,512 --> 00:09:29,867
Rym: Spoilers.

147
00:09:30,171 --> 00:09:31,638
Emily: Well, it's a movie about wayfinding.

148
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,030
Emily: It's about exploring and learning to sail.

149
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:42,450
Emily: And it's also about finding yourself and stuff like that.

150
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:45,090
Rym: I'd say meeting your heroes, but it wasn't really her hero.

151
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,488
Rym: And that was kind of a plot point.

152
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:53,510
Emily: So the whole plot is, she lives on this island and her dad is chief of the village.

153
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,050
Emily: And he's like, she really wants to go in the water.

154
00:09:56,351 --> 00:10:00,670
Emily: Ever since she was a little kid, she's been obsessed with the ocean and always going to the ocean.

155
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,010
Emily: And her dad's like, no, no, come back from the ocean.

156
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,030
Emily: Don't go to the ocean.

157
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,209
Emily: She's like, but the ocean.

158
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,450
Emily: And so he's like, stay on land.

159
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,868
Emily: You've got responsibilities here.

160
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,830
Emily: You know, be responsible, dad, kind of person.

161
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:21,970
Emily: And so it ends up she has to go save her village because the island's dying and they think it's a curse.

162
00:10:22,091 --> 00:10:25,570
Emily: And the only way to fix the curse is to return the heart.

163
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:34,010
Rym: But interestingly, no one thinks that except the grandmother who's old enough to remember what's in that cave and all that biz.

164
00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:35,730
Emily: I love the grandmother.

165
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,510
Emily: She was one of my favorite parts of that movie.

166
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:45,010
Emily: She was also very ocean-y and kind of mystical, but she was funny about it.

167
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,570
Emily: She's like, I'm just the village crazy lady.

168
00:10:48,412 --> 00:10:53,810
Rym: The characters that had speaking lines or that had any sort of prominent part of the movie were just really good characters?

169
00:10:54,376 --> 00:10:54,566
Rym: Yeah.

170
00:10:54,911 --> 00:11:00,490
Rym: They had complex motivations insofar as they needed them for whatever they were doing in the movie.

171
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,670
Emily: Yeah, the dad caused conflict.

172
00:11:04,071 --> 00:11:13,370
Emily: Their wills were often at odds, but he was portrayed as this loving, caring father, even though he was like, nope, don't go sailing kind of thing.

173
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,749
Emily: And I loved her relationship with her.

174
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:21,990
Emily: I mean, with her mom, there was a few good scenes with that, but mostly with her grandmother.

175
00:11:22,955 --> 00:11:25,870
Emily: That relationship was just really sweet and well done.

176
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:38,250
Emily: So anyway, she has a legend that she's got to go save the island and she braves the ocean to go find Maui, who's like this legendary demigod.

177
00:11:39,812 --> 00:11:44,250
Emily: And yeah, he's not quite what she expected, I think.

178
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:49,169
Rym: Yeah, he's not quite a dick, but he's- He's a trickster for sure.

179
00:11:49,451 --> 00:11:53,101
Rym: There's a little bit of Gaston in there, but then- No, not Gaston.

180
00:11:53,142 --> 00:11:54,410
Rym: He's more like- He's full of himself.

181
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,910
Emily: He's kind of like the genie a little bit.

182
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,312
Emily: Yeah, yeah.

183
00:11:58,432 --> 00:12:11,198
Emily: He's like very egotistical, but he's a little bit like the genie where he has modeling moments, but he's not quite as pop culture- The genie's only modeling because that's a post-apocalyptic society and they've rebuilt- Oh, come on.

184
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:11,688
Emily: That's silly.

185
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:13,690
Emily: I don't buy that.

186
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:14,709
Emily: Look at the evidence.

187
00:12:15,092 --> 00:12:15,775
Emily: Nonsense.

188
00:12:15,896 --> 00:12:18,046
Emily: You could make cases for just about anything.

189
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:22,190
Emily: Be like- Pokemon ashes in a coma the whole time or whatever.

190
00:12:22,313 --> 00:12:22,848
Rym: Oh, that's canon.

191
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:23,972
Emily: What?

192
00:12:24,455 --> 00:12:25,320
Emily: Nonsense.

193
00:12:25,722 --> 00:12:26,969
Emily: Nonsense, I tell you.

194
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:36,130
Emily: But Moana, one criticism I did see was that the character of Maui is based on a mythological figure from Polynesian culture.

195
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,799
Emily: And they were like, "Why did they make him so

196
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,502
Emily: doofy?".

197
00:12:39,984 --> 00:12:41,450
Emily: But they also made him kind of badass.

198
00:12:41,611 --> 00:12:44,830
Emily: So he's a combination of doofy and really badass.

199
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,276
Rym: Well, the movie has no- It ties up all of its ends really well.

200
00:12:48,557 --> 00:12:55,590
Rym: Maui is the way he is, but even that ends up being a big part of his character arc and the plot toward the end.

201
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:07,410
Rym: Not to spoil anything, everything like that in the movie, except possibly the chicken, wraps up in a very heartfelt and meaningful way.

202
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,617
Emily: The chicken wraps up just the way the chicken should wrap up.

203
00:13:10,678 --> 00:13:15,850
Emily: The chicken survives through the whole thing and ends up pecking at rocks just back where he started.

204
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:18,390
Rym: Okay, the Aladdin thing is checking out more and more.

205
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,395
Emily: Oh, bologna.

206
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:22,370
Emily: Anyway- This is looking pretty solid.

207
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:23,468
Emily: Anyway.

208
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:26,156
Emily: I'm going to have to look at this later.

209
00:13:26,216 --> 00:13:30,450
Emily: He's looking at this fan theory that Aladdin was set in this post-apocalypse.

210
00:13:31,256 --> 00:13:32,185
Rym: Look, it's like Adventure Time.

211
00:13:32,205 --> 00:13:32,609
Rym: Look at that.

212
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:35,607
Emily: But that's the video game.

213
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:35,930
Emily: What the heck?

214
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:36,769
Rym: Yeah, video game is canon.

215
00:13:37,711 --> 00:13:38,053
Emily: Whatever.

216
00:13:38,454 --> 00:13:39,900
Emily: Anyway, concentrate.

217
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,129
Emily: We're talking about Ocean Voyages here.

218
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:55,090
Rym: But the movie's just really good and kind of drew me in in a way that I guess recent Disney movies have, but there was a long drought of Disney movies that were not bringing me into them to that level.

219
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:59,789
Rym: They didn't have these sort of beautiful, expansive, immersive worlds to fill out.

220
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:00,212
Emily: Yeah.

221
00:14:00,476 --> 00:14:02,670
Rym: I feel like- Inside Out was pretty superficial.

222
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:03,930
Emily: That was a Pixar.

223
00:14:04,715 --> 00:14:04,986
Rym: Oh, yeah.

224
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:14,570
Emily: That's the thing that's interesting is I feel like for about a decade, it was like Disney's going down the tubes and Pixar's star is rising.

225
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:23,230
Emily: But I tell you, I think in the past maybe five years or so, I've found Disney movies to be generally more compelling than the Pixar counterparts.

226
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,381
Emily: Frozen had some issues.

227
00:14:25,502 --> 00:14:26,510
Emily: I enjoyed it anyway.

228
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,810
Rym: Yeah, Frozen was okay.

229
00:14:28,011 --> 00:14:28,937
Emily: No pros and cons.

230
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:29,741
Emily: Come on.

231
00:14:29,782 --> 00:14:31,170
Emily: It was like Norwegian.

232
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,716
Emily: But, oh, that's one thing I must say for Moana.

233
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:36,299
Emily: that disappointed me in Frozen.

234
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:41,550
Emily: that Moana did really well is incorporated traditional music of the setting into the score.

235
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,803
Rym: Frozen was like, "Hey, check out this traditional music.

236
00:14:43,823 --> 00:14:44,669
Emily: That's never coming

237
00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:44,890
Emily: back.".

238
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,982
Emily: And I was like, "Oh, Norwegian Joiking.

239
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:47,425
Rym: Oh, it's

240
00:14:47,505 --> 00:14:48,270
Rym: semi-people.".

241
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:49,401
Rym: Nope, the Joiking's gone.

242
00:14:49,481 --> 00:14:50,289
Rym: It's only in the soundtrack.

243
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,059
Emily: No, it's just musical music.

244
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,750
Emily: And this one had a good combination.

245
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:59,730
Emily: It was like Disney musical music by the guy who did Hamilton, Lin-Manuel Miranda, I guess.

246
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:04,304
Rym: And if you stay for the credits, one of the songs, one of the good songs in the movie.

247
00:15:04,324 --> 00:15:06,110
Rym: The movie has excellent, excellent music.

248
00:15:06,631 --> 00:15:09,330
Rym: He sings the song over the credits.

249
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:15,308
Emily: Yeah, and it was funny because I feel like the soundtrack, it wasn't like.

250
00:15:15,369 --> 00:15:15,770
Emily: I watched it.

251
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,749
Emily: I was like, "Wow, that had the best score of any Disney movie

252
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:18,890
Emily: ever.".

253
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,030
Rym: But it got stuck in my head.

254
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,817
Emily: It got stuck in my head hardcore.

255
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:24,950
Emily: I listened to the soundtrack at work the day after on Spotify.

256
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,562
Emily: And then I was going around humming Maui's song.

257
00:15:28,622 --> 00:15:30,490
Emily: I was humming the song that the crab sings.

258
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,000
Rym: Oh, we'll get to the crab.

259
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,646
Rym: The crab is...

260
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,510
Emily: So this crab monster appears.

261
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,301
Emily: He was your favorite because you love that, what's his name?

262
00:15:38,341 --> 00:15:40,450
Emily: Clements, Jermaine Clements or something.

263
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:42,690
Emily: Goodbye Moon Man.

264
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,089
Emily: And that's a song that always gets stuck in your head.

265
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,810
Rym: The crab starts singing and immediately all I can think of is it's the Moon Man guy.

266
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,400
Emily: It's the guy from Rick and Morty.

267
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:53,770
Emily: He played fart in Rick and Morty.

268
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:58,290
Emily: And he does this voice of this giant crab monster who impersonates.

269
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,850
Emily: He does this kind of David Bowie inspired glam rock number.

270
00:16:03,373 --> 00:16:05,086
Emily: And I was just like, "That sounds really

271
00:16:05,126 --> 00:16:05,529
Emily: familiar.".

272
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,566
Emily: And Rym leans over and he's like, "It's the guy from Moon

273
00:16:08,606 --> 00:16:08,827
Emily: Man.".

274
00:16:09,411 --> 00:16:11,265
Emily: I was like, "Oh yeah, I totally see

275
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:11,487
Emily: that.".

276
00:16:13,411 --> 00:16:18,830
Rym: As opposed to say Zootopia where there's one song that was memorable and that gets stuck in our heads.

277
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,038
Emily: Zootopia wasn't really a musical.

278
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:23,466
Emily: It had a very different format.

279
00:16:23,526 --> 00:16:24,570
Emily: This felt more like...

280
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:30,910
Rym: Zootopia had the same problem that those Marvel movies did where it had a soundtrack that just sort of served its purpose and then one iconic song.

281
00:16:32,011 --> 00:16:36,210
Emily: No, I would say Zootopia is a little bit more unique than the standard action movie.

282
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:41,330
Rym: I can't place a single melody of any sort from that movie.

283
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:46,419
Rym: That's super generic.

284
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,130
Rym: That could fit like a hundred movies.

285
00:16:50,704 --> 00:16:51,110
Rym: I got nothing.

286
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:57,890
Rym: Meanwhile, I've been singing three different songs from Moana under my breath constantly since we saw it.

287
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,430
Emily: Yes, Moana's songs really, really stick.

288
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:08,869
Emily: And also they incorporated like about half the songs incorporated Polynesian vocals in them.

289
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:09,935
Emily: And I really like that.

290
00:17:10,015 --> 00:17:13,290
Emily: I think it was mostly like Samoan culture.

291
00:17:13,712 --> 00:17:18,130
Emily: But I know they had a lot of New Zealand voice actors like Maori people and stuff like that.

292
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:19,428
Emily: And I thought that was pretty neat.

293
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,718
Emily: But anyway, music was good.

294
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:31,849
Emily: But I think the thing, one of my favorite, favorite things about the movie, and this is going to sound really superficial and animatory of me.

295
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:32,565
Rym: Now the water.

296
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:39,810
Emily: Oh my God, the shaders in this movie, like the nature stuff was really, really well done.

297
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:44,090
Emily: Just like it was so colorful and beautiful.

298
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:48,470
Emily: And it wasn't that it was realistic because that wasn't what made it cool.

299
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:58,960
Emily: It was that they took the good things of realism and the good things of like artistic expression and like exaggeration and brought them together.

300
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,390
Emily: And it was really, really beautiful.

301
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:08,169
Rym: I found all these articles where they said that they did a lot of study of their old 2D animation while simultaneously investing, kind of like how they invested in that.

302
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,049
Rym: What was the thing that made the Zootopia characters sort of just...

303
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:27,329
Emily: It was like motion noise where everything was like, it's kind of like moving holds, where if you have a freeze frame in an animation where the character is not really moving, if you just freeze it, it looks kind of stiff, especially if it's in 3D.

304
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:33,050
Emily: Like if the character is moving and then they stop moving and then they move again, it really breaks the illusion.

305
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:40,030
Emily: So they have this kind of, to add visual motion noise to a character's movement.

306
00:18:40,311 --> 00:18:44,830
Emily: It's just like a character will be standing and their fur will be blowing and the trees will be blowing.

307
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:46,889
Emily: It's like wind and stuff.

308
00:18:47,131 --> 00:18:49,610
Rym: Apparently that was a crazy system they developed.

309
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:54,690
Rym: And now they extended that with a liquid water and particle system for Moana.

310
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:57,249
Emily: It's nice to see all their tool development, right?

311
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,490
Emily: Because Zootopia was all about the fur.

312
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:06,470
Emily: It was about the fur and certain things, like I said, the movement stuff.

313
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:12,030
Emily: Moana is all about sand and water and the hair.

314
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,470
Emily: I love the hair in Moana.

315
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,436
Emily: She has this big, long, curly hair.

316
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,550
Rym: It swings around and gets stuck in her eyes.

317
00:19:21,751 --> 00:19:25,670
Emily: It swings around and she'll come out of the water and it will be all wet and it will hit her in the face.

318
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:31,270
Emily: I loved watching the way her clothes and her hair were animated.

319
00:19:31,591 --> 00:19:37,490
Emily: But just as a character, I found her to be a really compelling character.

320
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:43,970
Emily: Because they didn't make her overly like "tough girl, let's go, punch 'em" kind of thing.

321
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:49,210
Emily: She was just very determined and pretty smart and adventurous.

322
00:19:50,173 --> 00:19:53,070
Emily: But I don't know, I just thought she was good as a protagonist.

323
00:19:53,732 --> 00:19:55,647
Rym: It's not like "fuck this town, I'm out of

324
00:19:55,687 --> 00:19:55,889
Rym: here.".

325
00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:00,870
Emily: No, she cared a lot about her family and about the people in her village.

326
00:20:01,071 --> 00:20:04,790
Rym: She was pretty close to agreeing and staying to do her job.

327
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,509
Rym: And she was actually pretty okay with it.

328
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:15,590
Rym: And it wasn't until the thing that grandma showed her, and not to spoil, but basically one of my favorite things ever in anything is precursor technology.

329
00:20:16,152 --> 00:20:17,770
Rym: And that is a big part of this movie.

330
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,748
Emily: The movie was all about "where did our people come

331
00:20:21,849 --> 00:20:22,050
Emily: from?".

332
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:26,908
Emily: And then she has this revelation like "oh, we weren't always on this

333
00:20:27,088 --> 00:20:27,429
Emily: island.".

334
00:20:27,731 --> 00:20:30,430
Emily: And it's actually a really great scene.

335
00:20:32,171 --> 00:20:39,050
Emily: But also I like how some of the songs, they do the thing like... You never saw Princess and the Frog.

336
00:20:40,013 --> 00:20:41,150
Rym: I do need to see that.

337
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:53,170
Emily: It's a good movie, but there was this one musical number where it's like the style will switch during a song, and it will be like aping a specific artistic style.

338
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:56,750
Emily: And this one was like 1920s Jazz Age posters.

339
00:20:58,433 --> 00:21:05,930
Emily: And in Moana, they did a similar thing during Maui's song where it's all like stylized art and it looks like paper cutouts.

340
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,260
Rym: It's beautiful.

341
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,309
Rym: And they don't overuse it.

342
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,689
Rym: They just use it there in that one scene.

343
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:19,950
Rym: But it's just like... He basically has the powers that the witches have in Madoka and pulls her into this weird animated death world.

344
00:21:20,091 --> 00:21:21,928
Rym: Because he does try to kill her.

345
00:21:23,094 --> 00:21:24,970
Rym: I mean, you're welcome.

346
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,709
Emily: He's such a jerk.

347
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,339
Emily: He's straight up.

348
00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:29,910
Emily: Watch the movie and you'll see there's a point.

349
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,890
Emily: He's like hanging out on this island in this cave.

350
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,726
Rym: He tries to kill her like 20 times.

351
00:21:36,052 --> 00:21:37,349
Emily: He tries to kill the chicken too.

352
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,009
Emily: He's like "I'll fatten you up for

353
00:21:40,089 --> 00:21:40,190
Emily: later.".

354
00:21:40,311 --> 00:21:41,950
Rym: That villager tries to kill the chicken.

355
00:21:43,974 --> 00:21:48,586
Emily: At that point, everybody kind of looks at the chicken and be like "Should we just put it out of its

356
00:21:48,646 --> 00:21:49,050
Emily: misery?".

357
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:49,995
Emily: And she's like "No!

358
00:21:50,015 --> 00:21:51,423
Emily: He's our special

359
00:21:51,524 --> 00:21:52,147
Emily: chicken!".

360
00:21:54,193 --> 00:21:55,649
Emily: He's like trying to eat a rock.

361
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:01,330
Emily: But I like how the chicken wasn't too big a part of it.

362
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,610
Emily: It was just kind of like a little bit of comic relief.

363
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,802
Emily: Like look at the cute, dumb animal.

364
00:22:05,822 --> 00:22:06,989
Emily: do a cute, dumb thing.

365
00:22:09,553 --> 00:22:21,948
Emily: But yeah, they have that... It was definitely, again, kind of a buddy thing where at first they don't really get along and then they learn to work together.

366
00:22:21,968 --> 00:22:22,049
Emily: Yeah.

367
00:22:23,011 --> 00:22:25,770
Rym: So I highly recommend you go see this while it's still in the theater.

368
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,169
Emily: But it wasn't a romance for the once.

369
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,169
Emily: That's actually cool.

370
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:31,309
Emily: The Disney princess did not... It wasn't about finding the prince.

371
00:22:32,013 --> 00:22:40,770
Emily: She had an entirely different motivation and I really liked the resolution of this because to be honest, there wasn't really a villain.

372
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,300
Emily: There were bad guys.

373
00:22:42,341 --> 00:22:43,269
Emily: There were antagonists.

374
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,449
Emily: Like the crab was an antagonist.

375
00:22:45,992 --> 00:22:49,369
Emily: But I wouldn't call anybody particularly villainous.

376
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:54,181
Emily: There wasn't any overarching thing where somebody was like "Mwahahaha!

377
00:22:54,201 --> 00:22:55,467
Emily: I will thwart you at every

378
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:55,808
Emily: turn!".

379
00:22:56,311 --> 00:23:11,629
Emily: It was like the majority of the antagonism came from the adventure itself or from two characters kind of dealing with each other and dealing with their past and stuff like that.

380
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:18,730
Rym: Surprisingly subtle little arcs for the very relatively small cast in this movie.

381
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:23,610
Rym: And just haunting moments like when the ships are going by and she's sort of having her vision of what could be.

382
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,730
Emily: I like that scene.

383
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:33,310
Emily: I like the scene, like I said, the scene where it was like... You know in the hero's journey to get all film school on you.

384
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:42,590
Emily: But in the monomyth, there's always the point where the protagonist is kind of down and out before the climax where they have lost space in their self.

385
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:46,250
Emily: And it's like the belly of the whale, I think it's called in the monomyth.

386
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:56,250
Emily: But it's like, so they're at their lowest point and they receive some sort of revelation that allows them to go for it.

387
00:23:56,651 --> 00:24:01,589
Emily: That scene in Moana was really, really beautiful and I really liked it.

388
00:24:02,892 --> 00:24:04,790
Emily: And yeah, go see it.

389
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:11,249
Emily: It's a simple movie but it's definitely, I think, one of Disney's better records.

390
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:16,970
Rym: Of the recent stuff, I think only Zootopia beats it out on my list.

391
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:22,870
Rym: It's a solid number two and I think Zootopia only wins partly because of the subject matter and the two main characters.

392
00:24:24,033 --> 00:24:33,549
Rym: It's kind of hard when you don't like... But also, Zootopia dealt with some real shit really in a nuanced way that I did not expect that level of subtlety.

393
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:38,490
Emily: I liked that their two most recent movies were so different.

394
00:24:39,551 --> 00:24:45,010
Emily: You compare Zootopia and this film and they're both really good but in completely different ways.

395
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,891
Rym: Which don't worry because their next movie is Cars 3.

396
00:24:47,891 --> 00:24:49,089
Emily: That's Pixar, again.

397
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:53,693
Rym: Disney's next movie, Wreck-It Ralph 2 2018.

398
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:55,430
Rym: Then Incredibles 2, that's Pixar.

399
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,009
Emily: I mean, I liked Wreck-It Ralph but I don't really think it needs sequel.

400
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,669
Rym: Toy Story 4, that's Pixar.

401
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,127
Emily: God, they're having total sequelitis.

402
00:25:02,611 --> 00:25:03,829
Rym: Frozen 2 is listed here.

403
00:25:04,032 --> 00:25:04,409
Rym: For real?

404
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:07,131
Rym: For 2021.

405
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:12,390
Rym: And an untitled Lin-Manuel Miranda, Byron Howard developed Disney animation film is supposedly in the works.

406
00:25:12,634 --> 00:25:13,268
Rym: Okay, then.

407
00:25:15,136 --> 00:25:17,950
Emily: I know that Moana was in the works for a long time.

408
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:25,090
Emily: They really wanted to do... It's kind of funny because I think it started because they had all the Polynesian stuff at Disney World.

409
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:30,268
Emily: You know how Disney likes to work with existing properties and themes like Pirates of the Caribbean and stuff?

410
00:25:31,051 --> 00:25:33,889
Rym: We have the Polynesian, you know, the resort, the Polynesian.

411
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:38,950
Rym: We never did anything and luckily they didn't get that idea until 2016.

412
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:43,110
Rym: Can you imagine this movie in like 1940?

413
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:47,812
Emily: Well, I don't think... Well, Disney World hasn't been around since 1940.

414
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:48,970
Rym: When did they build the Polynesian?

415
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,450
Emily: Then we'll look at what Disney movies they were making.

416
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,830
Emily: I'm assuming it was sometimes in the 60s from the decor of that place.

417
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,649
Emily: It's like, I'd say mid-60s, I'm assuming.

418
00:25:58,053 --> 00:25:59,569
Emily: That's where we had the Tiki Bar.

419
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,943
Emily: That was actually some of my favorite memories from our recent trip to Disney World.

420
00:26:04,043 --> 00:26:05,990
Emily: was hanging out at the Polynesian Resort.

421
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:14,830
Emily: They have this balcony where it's an outside Tiki Bar and you can see the fireworks.

422
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:18,030
Rym: You can actually see the Disney castle and the fireworks in the distance.

423
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:21,470
Rym: They actually played the music and all the stuff for the fireworks right there.

424
00:26:21,591 --> 00:26:22,148
Rym: It was pretty fun.

425
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:33,410
Rym: It was a bunch of couples and adults like us, surprisingly similar demographic sitting there, all just having cocktails and sort of enjoying Disney from afar.

426
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:38,350
Emily: And the nice lady let me keep the glowing ice cube from the fancy drink.

427
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,551
Rym: All right, so 1971...

428
00:26:40,551 --> 00:26:41,439
Emily: See, I was right.

429
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,266
Rym: I said late 60s.

430
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:49,150
Rym: So let's see, we got The Jungle Book, The Aristocrats, Robin Hood, The Rescuers, Fox and the Hounds.

431
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:50,529
Emily: This is a different movie.

432
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,486
Emily: Fucking and sucking.

433
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:56,727
Emily: I don't think Disney is in that one.

434
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,908
Emily: But anyway, I kind of think that the development...

435
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,077
Rym: We're right all over in company.

436
00:27:03,098 --> 00:27:04,270
Rym: I always forget that movie exists.

437
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:05,719
Emily: I like that movie okay.

438
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:07,290
Emily: It's not great, but it's not terrible.

439
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,630
Rym: It's just, I forget, it never comes to mind.

440
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:18,970
Emily: But anyway, I feel like, because being in the industry I'm in, I keep a fairly close eye on what Disney's planning, like their development stuff.

441
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:29,270
Emily: And I know both The Snow Queen, which became Frozen, and a Polynesian princess movie were in the pipeline for many years and it got substantially rewritten.

442
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:33,610
Emily: And luckily the end result is a really good movie.

443
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,622
Rym: Well, they already had The Tiki Room.

444
00:27:37,191 --> 00:27:37,876
Rym: They can make that movie.

445
00:27:37,896 --> 00:27:39,850
Rym: It'll be Iago and everyone going on an adventure.

446
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,320
Emily: Oh my god, The Parrots.

447
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:44,050
Emily: That's a song that gets stuck in my head.

448
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:48,090
Emily: I'm like, no, don't even start with me, buddy.

449
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,650
Rym: I remember they had that one drink at The Polynesian, The Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room.

450
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:56,230
Emily: Anyway, it could have been really stereotypical.

451
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:04,250
Emily: And I'm not saying it was without any problems, but I was pretty impressed by the caliber of the movie.

452
00:28:05,856 --> 00:28:06,529
Emily: Good game, Disney.

453
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:16,508
Rym: But seriously, go see it in 3D while you can, because it will lose... It'll still be a great movie to see, but it'll lose something significant if you don't see it in 3D.

454
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:17,990
Emily: The depth of the environment.

455
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,775
Rym: It was designed for 3D.

456
00:28:19,795 --> 00:28:25,170
Rym: If you look at the credits, they put a lot of effort and care into the 3D environments.

457
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:25,930
Emily: Yeah.

458
00:28:26,313 --> 00:28:28,887
Emily: Now we have to review, let's see, we have to review Dr.

459
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:29,128
Emily: Strange.

460
00:28:29,531 --> 00:28:29,594
Emily: Dr.

461
00:28:29,616 --> 00:28:29,869
Emily: Strange.

462
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:30,981
Emily: We've got to review...

463
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,750
Rym: Lupin, Fujiko Mine, we'll do that one.

464
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:33,508
Emily: Yeah, we've got to do that one.

465
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:37,429
Emily: But I really want to drag you to go see the new Harry Potter because I really liked it.

466
00:28:38,052 --> 00:28:39,750
Rym: A bunch of white kids running around.

467
00:28:39,991 --> 00:28:41,068
Rym: It was good, though.

468
00:28:41,873 --> 00:28:44,185
Emily: It was 1920s New York, and it was fun.

469
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:49,967
Emily: It was like, imagine New York, prohibition era, plus dragons.

470
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:50,850
Emily: It's great.

471
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:58,170
Rym: I guess the two, I saw I think three Harry Potter movies, and one of them was like half of the Deathly Hallows or whatever.

472
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:02,530
Rym: One of them was the bad one with the Phoenix, I think?

473
00:29:03,271 --> 00:29:07,110
Emily: Yeah, the one Chamber of Secrets, which is the weakest of the Harry Potter books.

474
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:10,710
Rym: Yeah, I've not batted too well with Harry Potter movies.

475
00:29:10,811 --> 00:29:12,590
Emily: You're like so anti-Harry Potter.

476
00:29:13,192 --> 00:29:14,441
Emily: It's a great story.

477
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,569
Rym: I can't read those books.

478
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:17,513
Emily: Blah, blah, blah.

479
00:29:17,553 --> 00:29:18,537
Rym: Ron said, blah, blah.

480
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:19,823
Rym: Harry said, blah, blah, blah.

481
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:20,888
Rym: Ron said, blah, blah.

482
00:29:20,908 --> 00:29:27,649
Rym: Harry said, and then a sword fell from the sky into Harry's hands and he accidentally killed the salamander or whatever.

483
00:29:28,971 --> 00:29:29,262
Emily: Salamander.

484
00:29:31,192 --> 00:29:36,190
Emily: I think, I think you should narrow... See, you would be better than that potted Potter.

485
00:29:37,092 --> 00:29:38,609
Emily: You would have been a better like...

486
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,967
Rym: I can get my off-Broadway show.

487
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,130
Rym: Rims summarizes Harry Potter.

488
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,049
Emily: Harry Potter, having read approximately none of it.

489
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:46,714
Emily: Oh boy.

490
00:29:47,116 --> 00:29:49,469
Emily: Anyway, Disney's, Disney's pretty cool.

491
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:53,590
Emily: Pixar's needs to step up their game a little bit and that's our show.

492
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:57,527
Rym: And look forward to, I guess, Cars 3 if you're a Pixar fan.

493
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,429
Emily: Okay, one last thing before the end of the show.

494
00:30:01,452 --> 00:30:03,322
Emily: The trailer for Cars 3, right?

495
00:30:03,623 --> 00:30:04,870
Emily: Which we saw before Moana.

496
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,930
Rym: I had heard so much about this trailer.

497
00:30:08,051 --> 00:30:08,536
Rym: What the heck?

498
00:30:08,657 --> 00:30:09,850
Emily: I had heard a little bit.

499
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:16,129
Rym: It just shows the main car like dying in a car accident and then it's like everything changed and that's it.

500
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:21,410
Emily: But it doesn't show the car as like the weird car face.

501
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:26,810
Emily: You just see this computer animated car like flipping over and it's not like stylized all that much.

502
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:34,910
Emily: It's just like this red NASCAR looking car flipping over and wiping out and it's all like sparks and on fire.

503
00:30:36,173 --> 00:30:36,978
Emily: And I was like, what?

504
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:38,749
Emily: And then I was like, this is cars?

505
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:40,986
Rym: Okay, I learned what the deal is.

506
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:47,090
Rym: Blindsided by a new generation of blazing fast racers, the legendary Lightning McQueen is suddenly pushed out of the sport he loves.

507
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:53,490
Rym: To get back in the game and lead the help of eager young female race technician Cruz Ramirez with her own plan to win.

508
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:55,889
Rym: Plus inspiration from the late Doc Hudson.

509
00:30:56,732 --> 00:30:57,461
Rym: It's basically Rocky.

510
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,750
Emily: Oh, it's a comeback story.

511
00:31:00,171 --> 00:31:01,267
Rym: Except he's actually going to win.

512
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:03,868
Rym: Spoilers, I guess.

513
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,353
Emily: Well, I don't know.

514
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:10,707
Emily: Pixar could pull a thing and not have him win.

515
00:31:10,727 --> 00:31:11,590
Emily: They could have him die.

516
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,261
Rym: Then it cuts back to he's just in the hospital hallucinating.

517
00:31:14,281 --> 00:31:15,648
Rym: all of that from the actual accident.

518
00:31:15,768 --> 00:31:16,090
Rym: The end.

519
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:16,852
Emily: I don't know.

520
00:31:16,932 --> 00:31:21,010
Emily: Cars just weirds me out because it's like, I have difficulty.

521
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:24,970
Emily: Like little, little kids love the shit out of that movie.

522
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,961
Rym: Because they have cars.

523
00:31:26,001 --> 00:31:26,690
Rym: They can move them around.

524
00:31:27,212 --> 00:31:31,789
Emily: Yeah, like I get that little kids like it and it seems like, but like.

525
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,350
Rym: Cars bothers me on a fundamental level the way that like Rugrats does.

526
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:42,548
Emily: Yeah, I'm like, I have trouble immersing myself in that world because like I don't really understand how the world works and why.

527
00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:43,069
Emily: and like.

528
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:50,910
Rym: How come Angelica can talk to the babies and they understand each other, but like the babies can't talk to the adults, but Angelica can also talk to the adults.

529
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,279
Emily: Well, cause she's a toddler.

530
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,549
Emily: She's halfway between.

531
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,609
Emily: But she fully understands them.

532
00:31:55,851 --> 00:31:58,244
Emily: So did you ever read the book of 101 Dalmatians?

533
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,885
Rym: I don't think I've ever actually read it.

534
00:32:00,905 --> 00:32:01,330
Rym: I think I just.

535
00:32:02,052 --> 00:32:03,721
Emily: It's way better than the Disney movie.

536
00:32:03,782 --> 00:32:04,385
Emily: I really like it.

537
00:32:04,426 --> 00:32:05,130
Emily: It's very British.

538
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:15,409
Emily: But anyway, there's this one part where Pongo and misses encounter this old sheepdog and this little kid and the old sheepdog is like.

539
00:32:16,391 --> 00:32:20,770
Emily: Hangs out with the little kid and the little kid can kind of talk to the dogs and understand them.

540
00:32:21,151 --> 00:32:27,284
Emily: But he's like in that weird liminal stage between like starting to learn how to talk in people.

541
00:32:27,385 --> 00:32:29,710
Emily: So he's losing the ability to talk in dog.

542
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:38,210
Emily: And so it's kind of like that scene where it's like when they're little, they can talk to each other, but then they grow up and they lose the ability to talk baby.

543
00:32:39,734 --> 00:32:41,009
Rym: And I think we'll leave it at that.

544
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:41,430
Rym: Yes.

545
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,586
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

546
00:32:49,626 --> 00:32:54,600
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

547
00:32:54,981 --> 00:33:00,040
Rym: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

548
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,967
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

549
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:07,680
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.
