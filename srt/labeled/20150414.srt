1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,424
Rym: It's Tuesday April 14th 2015.

2
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:16,598
Rym: I'm Rym I am Scott and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:16,678 --> 00:00:24,023
Rym: tonight We're talking about the sheriff of Nottingham Really slowly for some reason.

4
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:26,468
Rym: also.

5
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:29,783
Scott: mount your friends Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,935 --> 00:00:43,446
Rym: So now we play a lot of games in our off and on game nights But lately we've been playing a lot of DDR again, and you know dance dance revolution for all you young Kids who just don't know things anymore the real revolution

7
00:00:43,727 --> 00:00:44,189
Scott: in gaming

8
00:00:45,252 --> 00:00:46,596
Rym: Mm-hmm, then you know it's.

9
00:00:46,656 --> 00:00:54,749
Rym: it's sad because I realized years ago because I had a red octane ignition pad Which was the best soft pad money could buy a slab one.

10
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:59,584
Rym: Yeah, so I had one that had a ps1 like a PlayStation hookup and nothing else.

11
00:00:59,604 --> 00:01:00,988
Scott: mine has all the hookups.

12
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:08,150
Rym: so PlayStation yeah, you can sell that for a decent amount of money because those haven't been manufactured in so long.

13
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:13,024
Rym: Yeah, you could use it, but I've bought some bootlegs.

14
00:01:13,044 --> 00:01:14,890
Rym: at least you can still buy the bootlegs.

15
00:01:16,554 --> 00:01:26,350
Rym: DDR is so dead except among ultra hardcore DDR people and the kinds of people who are like arcade machine enthusiasts in the u.s.

16
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:55,352
Rym: That I did never really expected to run into people younger than me who play DDR like more than a few years But just recently we've been having like some people over like doing some parties and things and DDR came up in casual conversation with strangers And I was like you DDR, and they're like you DDR and I was in DDR another room, and they're like bring to this room and some of these people have never heard of step mania and Long.

17
00:01:55,372 --> 00:01:58,521
Rym: story short we've been playing a lot of fucking DDR again and good.

18
00:01:58,562 --> 00:02:02,554
Rym: God is DDR the best dancing slash Bimani game ever made.

19
00:02:02,775 --> 00:02:04,962
Scott: DDR is one of the best games ever made.

20
00:02:04,982 --> 00:02:07,190
Rym: I mean pump it up not as good.

21
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:18,570
Rym: In terms of best video games ever DDR is way way up there like we did a pax lecture on why DDR is kind of notable and why other games have not really filled that niche.

22
00:02:18,711 --> 00:02:20,238
Scott: It's also a summer thing for some reason.

23
00:02:20,298 --> 00:02:22,870
Scott: even though it should be a winter thing it always ends up being a summer.

24
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:31,747
Rym: I know it's like the game I should play when I can't go outside But then gets warm out and suddenly the DDR pad is in the living room for the entire VR kicks in when the Sun comes out.

25
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:44,290
Scott: yeah No, but like if you made like a rubric of like what it takes to be a great video game I mean if you think about the greatest video games of which probably are things like Super Metroid or Super Mario 3.

26
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:50,270
Scott: Yeah, it's like but even though those are probably better than DDR if you it's like.

27
00:02:50,611 --> 00:02:56,190
Rym: It's like saying is Star Wars better than like your mom's fancy recipe?

28
00:02:56,933 --> 00:02:59,569
Rym: Like which one's better, but it's like DDR.

29
00:03:00,051 --> 00:03:00,372
Scott: It's like.

30
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:11,029
Scott: probably if you had a scoring system would prob at least a good scoring system that I Scott approved DDR might be the highest or perhaps only perfect scoring game there is.

31
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:20,163
Rym: well I mean it's designed so well though actually a lot of the things that we praised it for having such great design for Didn't appear until fourth mix.

32
00:03:20,384 --> 00:03:24,581
Scott: well fourth mix is when it Began right first second and third of AC beta.

33
00:03:24,762 --> 00:03:25,485
Rym: third mix is fine.

34
00:03:25,525 --> 00:03:38,677
Rym: third mix has it's playable But it's got problems, but man like when you accidentally like you start you hit a third mix song with third mix arrows You can feel Third mix arrows in your bones Like mixes after that.

35
00:03:38,838 --> 00:03:54,131
Rym: where you feel fourth mix like DDR hips like Someone who's never played it before can play the same song next to someone who's played it for multiple Decades and they can both totally have fun unless it's like some ridiculous max 300.

36
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:58,068
Rym: Well unless it's something that doesn't have like beginner mode which aren't that many.

37
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:04,118
Scott: well No, the thing is even the hard songs if they do have a beginner mode, but you drop out beginner mode It's like I was coming up.

38
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:05,149
Scott: Yeah, gotcha.

39
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:16,822
Rym: But it's like the little like the fact that the arrows Oscillate and that you can like train your brain, and I remember explaining to someone who's visiting us once They're like there's no way you're reading all those arrows like you've had.

40
00:04:16,843 --> 00:04:19,415
Rym: you have done this before and I'm like no But I mean it's patterns.

41
00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:26,390
Rym: your brain just kind of gets hardwired like if you play DDR You'll start dreaming about DDR like you'll dream about Tetris when you play a lot of Tetris.

42
00:04:26,993 --> 00:04:30,450
Rym: And then the next thing you know like you see arrows feet just move.

43
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:34,321
Rym: There is no conscious thought between those two input output.

44
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:34,823
Scott: Nope.

45
00:04:35,284 --> 00:04:36,528
Rym: God damn DRS a good game.

46
00:04:36,989 --> 00:04:45,022
Rym: So yeah I've been thinking about for a long time buying a DDR machine and the only reason I didn't just buy one like Literally before we did this show.

47
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:45,950
Scott: I don't have anywhere to put it.

48
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,054
Rym: I don't have anywhere to put it either.

49
00:04:47,114 --> 00:04:57,685
Rym: so kind of thinking about seeing if the building would let me put it in the gym As an exercise machine like it'd be mine But if they let me put it there and plug it in and put it on free play and then

50
00:04:57,705 --> 00:05:00,672
Scott: you move out because the new Buildings going up you can't see anything Then

51
00:05:00,732 --> 00:05:03,562
Rym: I'll be if I wonder that's just the excuse to have the machine.

52
00:05:03,923 --> 00:05:07,529
Rym: if I have to move and the other buildings like no You can't do that then I'll figure something out.

53
00:05:09,278 --> 00:05:11,193
Rym: But oh man DDR machine.

54
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:23,709
Rym: what I kind of want to do really is buy an art like the replacement pad for a DDR machine and Then set up like a relay box to an Arduino or something like that and then just use that as a pad.

55
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,737
Scott: I don't know what the hookups are for that.

56
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:31,989
Scott: It is well documented by ultra nerds So you can basically make a converter for it for that goes down as being.

57
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:34,119
Rym: I mean It's like high voltage because there's like there's a lot.

58
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,546
Rym: It's not USB.

59
00:05:35,587 --> 00:05:41,190
Rym: I'll put it that way But I'm confident I could plug that shit into an Arduino and make it happen.

60
00:05:41,571 --> 00:05:45,009
Rym: Hmm part of it's like you got a power like all those lights and everything in there.

61
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:50,630
Rym: I feel like with my modern knowledge like I made a hard DDR pad a long time ago And I feel like I could make one again.

62
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,650
Rym: That would be way better because I have more knowledge in your workshop, but I don't have a workshop.

63
00:05:55,313 --> 00:06:00,589
Rym: But the reason my old DDR pad failed is partly because while I had a workshop I didn't have a lot of money.

64
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:06,768
Rym: So I cut corners like I made this sort of like two metal plates separated by weather stripping contact.

65
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:10,104
Rym: nowadays I would just buy professional ribbon strips.

66
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:14,216
Rym: So anyway DDR I feel like there's gonna be.

67
00:06:14,257 --> 00:06:16,726
Rym: I'm gonna be talking about DDR a lot as I play DDR again.

68
00:06:16,746 --> 00:06:18,580
Rym: Mm-hmm That's all I got.

69
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,415
Rym: That's my Intro bit.

70
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:23,730
Rym: Do you have any news now that we're past that bit to the next bit of the show?

71
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,810
Scott: It's not really a lot of news going on in the gaming world.

72
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:32,369
Scott: I wanted to talk about Kojima being fired or not fired or whatever's going on there But the thing is whatever is going on.

73
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:40,635
Scott: There is so cryptic and so many conflicting in reports that I can't really talk about it with any Reliability or meaning.

74
00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:50,218
Scott: Yeah, so I just think it's really interesting and I'm I want to wait for it to you know fully pan out so then we can get all the dirt and Scoop it.

75
00:06:50,502 --> 00:06:58,344
Scott: Yeah So instead I'll just talk about hearthstone which is doing some pretty Big-time upgrades lately, right?

76
00:06:58,364 --> 00:07:16,436
Scott: They can't with the new adventure Right, but the big deal is that in the latest update or whatever, you know Every time an update comes out basically people take apart the binary files to dig for assets and they found a bunch of you know Textures that are for use in the iPhone version of the game Which isn't out yet to prove.

77
00:07:16,496 --> 00:07:18,765
Rym: this proves definitively that half-life 3 is coming.

78
00:07:19,468 --> 00:07:23,143
Scott: Yeah summer No, I mean they're coming out with iPhone version.

79
00:07:23,164 --> 00:07:27,010
Scott: they've said so right now We need to sort of know what it's gonna look like kinda now, right?

80
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:32,567
Scott: I don't know why game companies keep including future assets that aren't being used in the current version.

81
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,370
Scott: in the current version.

82
00:07:33,511 --> 00:07:34,153
Rym: I know why.

83
00:07:34,173 --> 00:07:34,675
Rym: whatever.

84
00:07:34,696 --> 00:07:40,902
Rym: because the way the version control is it's just easier for everybody Usually because better version control like I am.

85
00:07:40,983 --> 00:07:42,489
Rym: Yeah, I think it's the people.

86
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:49,450
Rym: Having seen that happen in every company I've ever worked for I see a lot of companies like using feature flags.

87
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:59,983
Scott: It's like so they release non production code to their production servers and just use different settings to keep those future Unfinished, you know features be disabled and I'm like fuck.

88
00:08:00,043 --> 00:08:03,295
Scott: No, I'm not putting any code on the production server That isn't production ready.

89
00:08:03,556 --> 00:08:09,721
Rym: We let that happen once with a product and then I was like, yeah We're not even though it might be disabled by a flag.

90
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:11,146
Scott: It's like hell no.

91
00:08:11,327 --> 00:08:12,230
Scott: Yeah anyway.

92
00:08:13,457 --> 00:08:25,198
Scott: so the reason that's notable is You know because there aren't really any other mobile games and this is why despite there being Some problems with hearthstone, right?

93
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,462
Scott: It's very luck based.

94
00:08:26,884 --> 00:08:28,249
Scott: You know, you'd get to pay to win.

95
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:49,127
Scott: ish Right, despite having many many issues Which are sort of made up for by it's actually usable user interface, which no other car digital card game seems to have It's pretty much the only multiplayer strategy game of note That you can play on an iPhone or iPad or pretty much tablet or phone.

96
00:08:49,187 --> 00:08:49,669
Scott: period.

97
00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:52,829
Rym: I mean The only other game I can think of is neuroshima hex.

98
00:08:53,010 --> 00:09:05,591
Scott: Yeah, the only other I mean the only other games that you can play that are even you know Worthwhile on tablets or phones that are real strategy games are pretty much all just board games Translated.

99
00:09:05,872 --> 00:09:11,890
Scott: Yeah, whereas hearthstone is a card game, but it also takes advantage of the fact that it's only a video game.

100
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:17,893
Scott: It's like you can take magic or in turn it into a video game because anything you can do with cards you can do With pixels.

101
00:09:18,395 --> 00:09:26,966
Rym: hearthstone does things that cannot be done with cards at all period which is the right way to go if you're making a game like that.

102
00:09:27,026 --> 00:09:30,256
Rym: like I mean Netrunner is cool because of like it.

103
00:09:30,276 --> 00:09:31,640
Rym: the cards are the interface.

104
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:39,669
Scott: It would be very hard to actually I mean if it's possible to do Netrunner a video game, but it's not possible to hearthstone card game.

105
00:09:40,011 --> 00:09:43,990
Scott: Netrunner to the video game would be very very difficult because there's so many timing windows.

106
00:09:44,091 --> 00:09:48,645
Scott: You know It's like basically constantly pause to give players the opportunity to do stuff.

107
00:09:48,665 --> 00:09:49,086
Scott: a better

108
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:58,340
Rym: option is Whatever your medium is for a game like tabletop video like whatever your medium is for the game Do use the things that make that medium unique

109
00:09:58,721 --> 00:10:05,163
Scott: sure, but it's like how come there aren't any other Tablet or phone games that at least on the same level.

110
00:10:05,223 --> 00:10:10,875
Scott: It's hearthstone in terms of multiplayer Somewhat meaningful strategy Action, you know.

111
00:10:10,935 --> 00:10:15,050
Rym: it's interesting because tons of games like that exist on mobile platforms.

112
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:15,552
Scott: They're all.

113
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:20,150
Rym: they're all in the gameboy advance and the gameboy gameboy color.

114
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,450
Scott: I mean there are turn-based strategy military games on the mobile device.

115
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,190
Scott: It's mostly but they're not advanced wars.

116
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,876
Scott: I've played like four or five of them and none of them are

117
00:10:30,137 --> 00:10:41,351
Rym: like seriously unless you are Final fantasy tactics advanced wars or fire emblem like at least to that level like don't even bother talking to me There's no reason to play you yeah,

118
00:10:41,371 --> 00:10:43,540
Scott: so I wish other companies would step in here.

119
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:52,617
Rym: But until then is it because the people who use you know gameboys like dedicated game counsel are more Gamery and thus are more willing to play game games?

120
00:10:53,521 --> 00:11:02,495
Rym: I don't know as opposed to the wider market because I feel like most people making games for mobile are Really going after the like shitware model mm-hmm.

121
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,076
Scott: I Don't know, but meanwhile the shitware companies are not having a good time lately.

122
00:11:07,096 --> 00:11:07,920
Rym: that is true.

123
00:11:08,603 --> 00:11:11,920
Scott: You know Zinga's switched back to their original CEO recently.

124
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:14,426
Scott: Newer one wasn't doing a good job.

125
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:15,650
Scott: They're basically dead.

126
00:11:15,671 --> 00:11:16,774
Scott: I don't know.

127
00:11:17,537 --> 00:11:18,340
Scott: yeah, whatever.

128
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,002
Rym: So we'll see.

129
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:23,859
Rym: so I have the tiniest little news here, and it's more relevant to Wednesdays, but whatever.

130
00:11:25,442 --> 00:11:29,616
Rym: So there's this robot statue that people keep calling a transformer, but it's not.

131
00:11:29,696 --> 00:11:30,659
Rym: it's obviously well.

132
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:43,700
Rym: It's obviously a non Gundam suit from a Gundam world with a weird mohawk helmet And it's in Turkey because some mayor was like this thing's going here and taxpayers are paying for it.

133
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,492
Scott: But if you're he's a mayor he can just say something.

134
00:11:46,513 --> 00:11:47,979
Scott: there's no town council or anything.

135
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:49,970
Scott: He's a dictator of the town.

136
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,352
Scott: your lies.

137
00:11:50,452 --> 00:11:55,850
Rym: mayor's in many places have Surprisingly wide latitude in terms of their powers.

138
00:11:56,051 --> 00:12:00,288
Rym: hmm and in a lot of places a mayor Yeah of New York.

139
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:09,652
Rym: Yeah, of course, New York, New York's mayor basically been Leashed to the governor and the state legislature.

141
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,668
Scott: How old you got to be?

142
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:14,619
Rym: I don't know.

143
00:12:15,422 --> 00:12:16,967
Rym: I think I think we're old enough to be mayor.

144
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:20,479
Rym: Oh, I think we just can't be like senators or presidents.

145
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,699
Scott: still Why do we get like town council for LIC?

146

Scott: I don't know.

148
00:12:25,415 --> 00:12:26,120
Rym: LSE isn't a town.

149
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,042
Rym: I guess we could join the.

150
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:30,713
Scott: there has to be a town council representative person for a town.

151
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:31,475
Rym: What town are we in?

152
00:12:31,495 --> 00:12:34,042
Scott: a City council?

159
00:12:43,253 --> 00:12:44,076
Scott: You don't want to do that.

160
00:12:44,216 --> 00:12:45,139
Scott: I don't do shit.

161
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:53,122
Rym: Anyway, this is just funny from a lot of perspectives because basically he started getting a lot of shit about this from people who are like Why he's.

162
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:54,749
Scott: his comment was respect the robot.

163
00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:57,500
Rym: Yeah, that's that was his response to all the criticism.

164
00:12:58,382 --> 00:12:59,307
Rym: So just go look at this thing.

165
00:12:59,428 --> 00:13:00,052
Rym: It's just kind of funny.

00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:00,876
Scott: best response.

167
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:01,903

Scott: it's a thing of the day not a news.

169
00:13:03,232 --> 00:13:04,218
Rym: No, cuz I got a thing of the day.

00:13:10,614 --> 00:13:11,848
Rym: So anyway things of the day.

171
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,869
Rym: So this is something related to my DDR stuff earlier.

172
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:24,370
Rym: So if you lived behind the Iron Curtain like in the Soviet Union during the Cold War it was hard enough to get computers.

173
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,430
Rym: So let's say you've somehow got a computer.

174
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:33,123
Rym: You think you're gonna fucking get a printer or a mouse or any peripheral.

175
00:13:33,824 --> 00:13:35,629
Rym: and this is a collection of the?

176
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:43,850
Rym: hacked together homemade Peripherals that nerds in the Soviet Union made for their computers.

177
00:13:44,192 --> 00:13:49,337
Rym: There's like mice that were made out of spice containers with ping-pong balls Like this.

178
00:13:49,377 --> 00:13:50,470
Rym: shit is amazing.

179
00:13:51,871 --> 00:13:53,056
Scott: Why don't we make some peripherals?

180
00:13:53,276 --> 00:13:54,481
Rym: you want to just make some peripherals?

181
00:13:54,682 --> 00:13:54,903

Rym: I wrote my name on.

191
00:14:01,523 --> 00:14:01,864

00:14:01,885 --> 00:14:03,791
Rym: I Don't know.

193
00:14:03,811 --> 00:14:04,493
Rym: I don't know.

194
00:14:04,654 --> 00:14:07,023
Rym: I don't think these people were making laser mice.

195
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:07,966
Rym: I think they were making.

196
00:14:08,006 --> 00:14:09,070
Scott: no one had laser mice.

197
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:13,666
Rym: Yes, ping-pong ball mice that's a good mouse though the rollerball of a handmade mouse.

00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,331
Rym: Thank you.

200
00:14:15,351 --> 00:14:17,780
Scott: Just didn't even get a billiard ball like most people.

201
00:14:18,182 --> 00:14:20,470
Rym: Ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa a housing for the mouse.

202
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,050
Rym: They used a plastic kitchen spice can inside.

203
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:27,063
Rym: They placed a circuit board where there were two mutually perpendicular metal rollers.

204
00:14:27,384 --> 00:14:28,107
Rym: on both rollers.

205
00:14:28,147 --> 00:14:31,417
Rym: There was a jagged Aperture made from thick paper.

206
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:35,830
Rym: its position was read using an LED in a pair of photo transistors.

207
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:37,562
Rym: It was a light made.

208
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:39,803
Rym: It was a light mouse Optical mouse.

209
00:14:39,844 --> 00:14:43,241
Scott: Well, yes Was that the perhaps the first optical mouse the odd.

00:14:43,302 --> 00:14:45,270
Rym: this nerds optical mouse?

211
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:49,000
Rym: That he made behind the Iron Curtain was better than any mouse.

212
00:14:49,141 --> 00:14:50,646
Rym: I owned during that era.

213
00:14:51,188 --> 00:14:51,830
Scott: Good job, dude.

214
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:55,501
Rym: Yeah, anyway, so this thing's amazing and you just check out.

Scott: Yeah Excellent work.

217
00:15:03,206 --> 00:15:03,933
Rym: So What do you have for me?

218
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,102
Scott: So there's this village somewhere?

219
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:08,090
Scott: I don't even know the name of the village doesn't freaking matter.

220
00:15:08,511 --> 00:15:12,043
Scott: It's a village and they have a tourist attraction in this village.

221
00:15:12,686 --> 00:15:14,010
Scott: It's the thing that many places have.

222
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,690
Scott: It's a model of the village in the village, right?

223
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,795
Scott: Just like me your dog.

224
00:15:18,936 --> 00:15:23,709
Scott: just like there's a model of New York City out in the Queen's Art Museum There's a model of this village in this village.

225
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:29,586
Scott: What's notable is that this model is pretty big pretty significant percentage of the village.

226
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:30,830
Scott: It's not a big village, right?

227
00:15:31,553 --> 00:15:32,399
Scott: Model of itself.

228
00:15:32,561 --> 00:15:37,548
Rym: Well kind of like how you know You had a lot of conventions where they account for like 10% of the population of the town.

229
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:44,382
Scott: Yep well this model of the village contains a Model of the village model.

230
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:48,042
Rym: Whoa That is so up my alley.

231
00:15:48,082 --> 00:15:49,450
Rym: That is my kind of thing.

232
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,339
Scott: It is recursive a certain number of times.

233
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,130
Scott: that is excessive but not you know impossible.

234
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,444
Scott: So it's like you look at the model of the.

235
00:15:58,605 --> 00:16:09,347
Scott: you're in the village You're looking at this model of the village and in that model is A model of the model and in that model is a model of the model and perhaps one or two or three more times It goes down

236
00:16:09,972 --> 00:16:19,189
Rym: Scott the fact that you picked this because you know very well that one of my favorite things in the world is when someone Has a picture of their cubicle in their cubicle and in that picture is the picture of the cubicle.

237
00:16:20,451 --> 00:16:23,461
Rym: That kind of thing the yo-dog is my favorite thing.

238
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:24,083
Scott: Yo-dog.

239
00:16:24,103 --> 00:16:26,170
Scott: I put model village in your model village.

240
00:16:28,051 --> 00:16:34,718
Rym: In the moment the book club book is still water ship down is the story of rats rats rabbits on an adventure Maybe next week.

241
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:37,071
Rym: You should do the secret of NIMH Mmm.

242
00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:38,842
Rym: Yeah, I haven't read that in a long time.

243
00:16:39,325 --> 00:16:40,029
Scott: Yeah, it's a kid's book.

244
00:16:41,511 --> 00:16:42,415
Rym: Yeah, half the books.

245
00:16:42,455 --> 00:16:43,620
Rym: We've done our kids books.

246
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,046
Scott: Do you keep picking kids books?

Rym: All right, what book you gonna pick next?

249
00:16:49,351 --> 00:16:56,470
Rym: All right, just don't cross me or it's gonna be some LeCombe de Monte Cristo Perhaps the man in the mask made of iron.

250
00:16:56,631 --> 00:17:00,329
Scott: I'm not sure if this is crossing you or not, but we're gonna find we're gonna find out.

251
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:03,338
Rym: indeed I hope it's just something I've already read and I'll just laugh.

252
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:04,080
Scott: that's possible.

253
00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:06,146
Rym: It is possible, especially cuz you won't tell me.

254
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:12,589
Rym: Mm-hmm All right, so that aside We have no live shows like convention appearances.

255
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:17,910
Rym: Oh Connecticut until Connecticut July if you if you want to present something at Connecticut.

256
00:17:18,653 --> 00:17:22,309
Rym: The panel submissions closed over half a month ago.

257
00:17:23,294 --> 00:17:24,540
Rym: The form is still open.

258
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,787
Rym: you can still submit.

259
00:17:25,907 --> 00:17:30,813
Rym: however I've been scheduling shit for a while Unless.

260
00:17:30,874 --> 00:17:36,411
Rym: what you submit is so awesome that I cannot resist probably not getting into schedule at this point Mm-hmm.

261
00:17:36,692 --> 00:17:41,487
Rym: So let this be a lesson to you send your stuff to conventions early not late.

262
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:45,530
Scott: Yeah Remember conventions have like a whole year of not doing anything.

263
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:49,690
Scott: You can probably start sending very shortly after the convention ends for the next year.

264
00:17:49,971 --> 00:17:50,613
Rym: I mean packs.

265
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:53,622
Rym: Australia badges are already on sale guys.

266
00:17:54,023 --> 00:17:54,805
Scott: That's in October.

267
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:55,367
Scott: Yeah.

268
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:58,359
Scott: Yeah I don't know.

Rym: Watch all our videos.

271
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,059
Rym: We got tons of videos of our stuff on YouTube.

272
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:08,004
Scott: come and check us out on the internet and all the other places besides the Ignites Apparently already found GeekNights.

273
00:18:08,044 --> 00:18:08,870
Scott: So go to the other places.

274
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:12,261
Rym: Yeah, our forum is pretty rockin actually and it's mostly smart people.

275
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:17,622
Rym: We've been so few people over the years that it's kind of Unprecedented how good that community is.

276
00:18:17,642 --> 00:18:18,889
Rym: You guys should join it.

277
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,870
Scott: Well, also we just don't let people in it's begin with who are shitty.

278
00:18:22,412 --> 00:18:23,738
Rym: How do we not let people in?

279
00:18:23,758 --> 00:18:25,807
Scott: because I look at their reason for applying.

280
00:18:26,129 --> 00:18:29,936
Rym: Oh, yeah If we got about that you apply.

281
00:18:30,057 --> 00:18:32,264
Scott: make sure you write something in the application.

282
00:18:32,304 --> 00:18:48,469
Scott: that makes me like, you know I've seen people write things that are sort of like on the edge like I want to start a discussion or I would like to talk to like-minded people and it's like Nothing in that sentence while that sentence probably is maybe not robot.

283
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:54,170
Scott: ish You haven't indicated to me that like you're a listener or you didn't even mention GeekNights or anything.

284
00:18:54,671 --> 00:18:59,445
Scott: So it's like that is not getting an accept, you know, you need to write something.

285
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:01,150
Rym: That's like prove you're a human.

286
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:03,255
Scott: Someone did one today.

287
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:08,094
Scott: that was like I've been a listener for a long time and have never joined the forums and it's like that's A good one, right?

288
00:19:08,475 --> 00:19:10,824
Scott: You said you're a listener and you know robots not right.

289
00:19:10,844 --> 00:19:12,590
Rym: just prove you're a human who isn't shitty.

290
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,178
Rym: That's all you need to do.

291
00:19:14,198 --> 00:19:16,470
Rym: Yeah, write a sentence that proves both of those things.

292
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,073
Scott: It was a current.

293
00:19:17,093 --> 00:19:20,310
Scott: I also wrote it properly like a complete sentence with grammar and spelling.

294
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:21,475
Rym: Yeah, pretty much.

295
00:19:21,515 --> 00:19:23,965
Rym: grammar and spelling are the only real rules in our right.

296
00:19:24,025 --> 00:19:32,410
Rym: like I am listener I don't know if someone said that I might maybe sure whatever especially if their account posted only in that language.

297
00:19:32,811 --> 00:19:36,144
Scott: Alright, so, um, you know a while back we did an episode.

298
00:19:36,405 --> 00:19:43,150
Scott: we talked about this game But we didn't talk too much about it, I think it was probably the Pac South review episode.

299
00:19:43,531 --> 00:19:52,138
Scott: yep, but now it's time to talk about this game in depth because we have played it many times and I've indeed purchased it and We know all there is to know about it.

300
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:57,618
Rym: sheriff of Nottingham designed by Sergio Halavan Brian Pope Benjamin Pope and Andres that.

301
00:19:57,638 --> 00:20:01,008
Scott: so these are I think the dice tower dudes.

302
00:20:01,068 --> 00:20:01,670
Scott: Is that correct?

303
00:20:02,171 --> 00:20:03,376
Rym: I am not a hundred percent sure.

304
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:06,710
Scott: actually, I think I was told that these are the dice tower people's.

305
00:20:08,055 --> 00:20:09,710
Rym: I can figure that out while we're talking.

306
00:20:09,891 --> 00:20:16,735
Scott: Yeah, but anyway, so sheriff of Nottingham is obviously has the theme of you Robin Hood Right kind of action.

307
00:20:17,056 --> 00:20:21,669
Scott: The art is all awesome with all kinds of crazy characters really well-designed and what.

308
00:20:21,709 --> 00:20:23,721
Rym: yeah I really like the art in this game.

309
00:20:23,741 --> 00:20:33,630
Scott: It's very very professional arts And basically the game works like this Someone is the sheriff of Nottingham, you know King John is not in the picture apparently.

310
00:20:34,975 --> 00:20:40,510
Scott: Well, he's sort of in the picture People merchants who have nothing to do with Robin Hood and his merry men.

311
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,729
Scott: We're a little John or Friar Tuck or Maid Mary or anything like that.

312
00:20:44,472 --> 00:20:54,847
Scott: They are merchants and they need to bring things into Nottingham from the outside world in order to sell them in The market, you know bread cheese chickens things that people need.

313
00:20:54,947 --> 00:21:01,916
Scott: right the sheriff He's at the gate of Nottingham and he doesn't want anyone bringing things into Nottingham That shouldn't be in Nottingham.

314
00:21:01,977 --> 00:21:15,004
Scott: things that might help Robin Hood and his merry men like crossbows Rye bread Pepper Silk for Maid Marian, you know, nothing like that is allowed right.

315
00:21:15,244 --> 00:21:20,180
Scott: only things that are allowed are apples Chickens cheese and bread.

316
00:21:20,341 --> 00:21:20,924
Scott: That's it.

317
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:22,230
Scott: No other imports.

318
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:32,470
Rym: so every game all you do is go around and someone's the sheriff and Everyone puts between one and five goods in their bag and they look the sheriff in the eye.

319
00:21:33,272 --> 00:21:41,074
Rym: You have it says you have an actual bag that you put actual cards in and snap shut a snap that it makes a loud Audible snap.

320
00:21:41,155 --> 00:21:47,437
Scott: and when you give it you give this bag to the sheriff and look them in the eye and tell the sheriff What is in the bag?

321
00:21:47,497 --> 00:21:50,050
Rym: There are four chickens in this bag, right?

322
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:52,237
Scott: There's really only 20 different things.

323
00:21:52,257 --> 00:21:56,130
Scott: You can tell the sheriff you must pick one and only one of the legal good types.

324
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:01,643
Scott: So chicken bread cheese Apple and you give a number between one and five.

325
00:22:01,704 --> 00:22:02,890
Scott: the number must be correct.

326
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:05,443
Scott: If you have three cards in the bag, you must say three.

327
00:22:05,463 --> 00:22:06,890
Rym: Yeah, you can't lie about right?

328
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:11,190
Scott: So there's really only 20 possibilities of things that you could say one apple two apple three apple four apple five.

329
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,160
Scott: Oh one chicken two chicken three, right cetera.

330
00:22:13,804 --> 00:22:14,769
Scott: and you hand him the bag.

331
00:22:14,829 --> 00:22:17,178
Scott: now What's in the bag could be fucking anything?

332
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,210
Scott: Who knows what the hell's gonna be five crossbows Jesus Christ.

333
00:22:20,351 --> 00:22:22,043
Scott: Yeah, give me five peppers.

334
00:22:22,124 --> 00:22:22,849
Scott: It could be anything.

335
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,610
Scott: But what you tell him is something legal because obviously you're not gonna tell the sheriff something illegal.

336
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:35,370
Scott: Then the sheriff completely of their own will may open or not open any number of bags.

337
00:22:35,872 --> 00:22:38,240
Rym: The sheriff's choices are hand the bag back to you.

338
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,090
Rym: And once they hit it back to you, they can't ask for it again.

339
00:22:41,191 --> 00:22:41,995
Rym: You've got it back.

340
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:44,390
Rym: Those five crossbows are going right into your stall.

341
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,763
Rym: So crossbows here crossbows or you can open it as soon as he unsnaps it.

342
00:22:50,344 --> 00:22:50,866
Rym: That's it.

343
00:22:50,926 --> 00:22:52,010
Rym: He can't resnap it.

344
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:55,081
Rym: He's looking in that bag or he can engage with you.

345
00:22:55,101 --> 00:22:57,430
Rym: So Scott, what would you pay me?

346
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:00,763
Rym: Would you pay me five doubloons to not open your bag?

347
00:23:00,803 --> 00:23:02,309
Scott: I dare you to open my bag.

348
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:10,290
Rym: Sure What I dare you to open my this bag if my friend Muggsy were hiding if my friend crossbows hiding in there.

349
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:12,050
Scott: So here's the deal.

350
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:22,889
Scott: if you all if you have in your bag what you said was in there and the sheriff opens it the sheriff owes you money because He opened your totally legit goods and wasted your merchant time.

351
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:27,410
Rym: man If the TSA had to pay me every time there wasn't a bomb in my bag, that would be amazing.

352
00:23:28,531 --> 00:23:34,290
Scott: Now if the sheriff opens the bag and he finds something in there, that's not supposed to be in there like my Scott.

353
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:35,967
Rym: That's a nice crossbow.

354
00:23:35,987 --> 00:23:36,250
Rym: You got.

355
00:23:37,735 --> 00:23:39,119
Scott: You said you had four chickens.

356
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:42,790
Scott: I see three chickens, but this chicken is the king's chicken.

357
00:23:43,232 --> 00:23:45,786
Scott: How is the king's chicken in your chicken basket?

358
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:53,135
Rym: So the sheriff then throws away all the contraband if he catches it and you got to pay him based on there's.

359
00:23:53,195 --> 00:23:54,482
Rym: there's of every card has a value.

360
00:23:54,522 --> 00:23:55,366
Rym: that's points.

361
00:23:55,527 --> 00:24:01,049
Rym: it's worth and Dollar, it's worth as contraband meaning if the sheriff finds it.

362
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:04,830
Scott: Yeah There's a basic an award value and a penalty value.

363
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:21,290
Rym: It's like something will be worth like seven victory points if it's in your stall at the end of the game and you can use That as part of a bribe or whatever like a deal or it's just victory points at the end and on the bottom It'll say like four in red meaning if the sheriff sees it in your bag you owe him four bucks if it's in there.

364
00:24:21,831 --> 00:24:24,360
Rym: But if it's legal, it's always two.

365
00:24:24,782 --> 00:24:27,010
Rym: so the chickens worth like three or four bucks or whatever.

366
00:24:27,411 --> 00:24:32,710
Rym: But if the sheriff opens your bag and you've got five legit chickens the sheriff owes you ten bucks.

367
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:41,149
Scott: Yep So some of the goods that are contraband like, you know are just like crossbow or silk or whatever And they're just worth a lot of money if you can sneak them into town.

368
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:48,202
Scott: But there are certain other goods like the king's apples the king's You know chickens the king's rye bread.

369
00:24:48,624 --> 00:25:00,010
Scott: if you get that stuff into town Not only is it worth a lot it also counts as cheese bread Chickens apples because the end of the game whoever has the most apples gets extra bonus points.

370
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,059
Scott: There is the most cheese gets bonus points.

371
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:04,510
Scott: I guess it's cuz you get a reputation for being the best cheese dealer.

372
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:05,634
Scott: I guess I don't know.

373
00:25:05,915 --> 00:25:08,825
Scott: So the king's cheese counts is like three cheeses.

374
00:25:08,986 --> 00:25:10,110
Scott: It's like a super cheese.

375
00:25:10,514 --> 00:25:18,538
Scott: So if you get that into town It's gonna be really easy for you to win the cheese battle of who has the most cheese because you got three cheeses in one Card snuck through that

376
00:25:18,678 --> 00:25:24,498
Rym: aspect actually kind of like a small world modified the feel of Vinci by hiding the victory points.

377
00:25:24,979 --> 00:25:27,986
Rym: by doing that it sort of makes the game like.

378
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,495
Rym: it makes the game not just Calculated at the end.

379
00:25:30,516 --> 00:25:33,189
Rym: it makes it hard for someone to say I'm winning by eight.

380
00:25:33,671 --> 00:25:38,750
Rym: So I should do this because the if someone's got a bunch of normal contraband.

381
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:42,470
Rym: That's just a bunch of victory points, but you don't know if they've got like the chicken contraband.

382
00:25:42,571 --> 00:25:43,118
Rym: You can't be.

383
00:25:43,301 --> 00:25:47,428
Scott: you're not secure When you sneak stuff in the town or bring it into town.

384
00:25:47,468 --> 00:25:47,810
Scott: legally.

385
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:52,713
Scott: It's publicly visible what you have brought into town except for contraband Which is face down.

386
00:25:52,733 --> 00:25:57,950
Scott: so people know how many cards of contraband you snuck in but they don't know what is on those cards.

387
00:25:58,111 --> 00:26:05,416
Rym: Nothing is better than when you convince the sheriff to not look in your bag and he hands it back and you pull five Motherfucking contraband.

388
00:26:05,437 --> 00:26:06,744
Rym: just lay them all face down.

389
00:26:06,764 --> 00:26:10,082
Rym: I Can't I cannot express to you how good that feels.

390
00:26:10,323 --> 00:26:14,790
Scott: So here's the thing in this game Number one the way you draw the cards.

391
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:17,070
Scott: We're not gonna get into those rules because it's just sort of a little bit fiddly.

392
00:26:17,211 --> 00:26:18,789
Rym: It's hard to teach this to people.

393
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:25,230
Scott: Yeah, but basically you draw cards in certain ways and it's also discard piles and sort of like a rummy situation.

394
00:26:25,911 --> 00:26:37,209
Scott: It's easy for other players to know what you could have in your hand because some of the cards you draw are face-up when you Draw them and if anyone's paying attention, which the sheriff should be they can figure out what is in your hand.

395
00:26:37,731 --> 00:26:41,930
Scott: So if you're like five chickens, someone would be like you just picked up like three peppers.

396
00:26:42,011 --> 00:26:44,225
Scott: There's no way you could have five chickens in your hand.

397
00:26:44,245 --> 00:26:47,266
Scott: It's not possible And then they'll just call you out.

398
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:56,181
Scott: another thing is that Even when it is possible People could look around and count the visible cards.

399
00:26:56,301 --> 00:26:57,505
Scott: So later in the game.

400
00:26:57,525 --> 00:26:58,749
Scott: They're like, huh?

401
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,160
Scott: There's already like 40 apples out.

402
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,810
Scott: There's no way that you can do four apples, right?

403
00:27:05,452 --> 00:27:12,835
Rym: So unlikely what I found happens in practice is there are so many cards in that deck You can't count perfectly.

404
00:27:12,876 --> 00:27:14,562
Scott: because there's so many freaking cards.

405
00:27:14,662 --> 00:27:16,630
Rym: people fuck up the soft count.

406
00:27:16,811 --> 00:27:17,915
Rym: That's all we play with like.

407
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:28,325
Rym: there was a game where I legit had four bread in my hand and I was like for motherfucking bread and the sheriff and other people also like one bread to bread whatever.

408
00:27:28,365 --> 00:27:31,010
Rym: and the sheriff was like There's a lot of bread out.

409
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:35,464
Rym: There's no way you have bread and no one was lying because the soft count was really misleading.

410
00:27:35,565 --> 00:27:39,254
Rym: because there's so many cards and people Overestimated what they've seen right.

411
00:27:39,675 --> 00:27:54,410
Scott: also while sneaking contraband into town is such a hugely powerful play if you can pull it off It's actually kind of difficult and from what I've seen Except in cases where someone manages to to bring in a ton of contraband in the town.

412
00:27:55,070 --> 00:28:02,310
Scott: Usually the person who wins this game is someone who is just able to really efficiently bring in the most legit goods in the well.

413
00:28:02,812 --> 00:28:03,294
Rym: So it depends.

414
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:04,380
Rym: cuz I win a lot.

415
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,390
Rym: I seem to be really good at this game.

416
00:28:06,531 --> 00:28:09,230
Rym: I'm also pretty good you are but you have not won it in a while.

417
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,116
Rym: You won the early games.

418
00:28:11,397 --> 00:28:15,290
Rym: I won many times, but I think the problem is you play a very conservative strategy.

419
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,989
Rym: What Scott will do is be like so that I got four bags here.

420
00:28:18,891 --> 00:28:23,870
Rym: I'm going to open two of them pay me $10 to not be in that lottery and he'll do it randomly.

421
00:28:24,051 --> 00:28:25,014
Scott: Yep, it works.

422
00:28:25,435 --> 00:28:25,696
Rym: It works.

423
00:28:25,756 --> 00:28:28,766
Rym: Okay, but I've had better luck by and maybe it's just.

424
00:28:28,786 --> 00:28:29,830
Rym: it depends on who you're playing with.

425
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:35,176
Rym: But if someone's just really obvious like I had this beautiful moment with a friend of ours when I looked at him I'm like you said.

426
00:28:35,197 --> 00:28:36,285
Rym: you have five chickens in here.

427
00:28:38,432 --> 00:28:39,519
Rym: What would you like to offer me?

428
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,717
Rym: a bribe to not open your bag and they're like I would like to offer you four.

429
00:28:42,757 --> 00:28:51,850
Rym: and I immediately opened the bag because I knew there's a fucking contraband in there and I Knew they weren't clever enough right then to have been tricking me because I made him talk and make the decisions too quickly, right?

430
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,390
Scott: That's another thing is much like settlers.

431
00:28:53,591 --> 00:28:56,123
Scott: I don't really see a reason to bargain with anyone.

432
00:28:56,183 --> 00:29:00,378
Scott: if someone's bargaining with you That means they're going to pay you.

433
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:04,389
Scott: they want to pay you some amount less than what the penalty is going to be.

434
00:29:05,112 --> 00:29:07,602
Scott: But if I just open the bag, I get the penalty money.

435
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:10,614
Rym: Yeah, you say what if I offer you look I'll give you.

436
00:29:10,634 --> 00:29:12,361
Rym: I got five cards right in here.

437
00:29:12,381 --> 00:29:14,710
Rym: I'm gonna tell you right now three of her contraband.

438
00:29:14,971 --> 00:29:16,156
Rym: You'll make 12 bucks.

439
00:29:16,196 --> 00:29:18,667
Rym: If you open my bag, I'll give you 15.

440
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:19,330
Scott: then I would do it.

441
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:20,916
Scott: No one has made those kind of offers.

442
00:29:21,057 --> 00:29:24,410
Scott: Everyone is off always offers less than what the penalty is gonna be.

443
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,887
Scott: Yep, so there's no reason to take their deal.

444
00:29:27,028 --> 00:29:30,678
Scott: Also Also, I would say have that much contraband.

445
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:32,243
Scott: Why would I offer that?

446
00:29:32,464 --> 00:29:34,310
Scott: Why wouldn't I just right?

447
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,569
Scott: Well, do you never know basically giving me that person the game?

448
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:44,689
Rym: I might propose a deal like that to see if the sheriff is like, oh, I know there's contraband in there.

449
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:49,930
Rym: now Opens the bag anyway, oh it is actually just two chickens right now there is right.

450
00:29:50,091 --> 00:29:54,932
Scott: So there are some strategies that are out there that I don't see and I haven't seen used enough Right.

451
00:29:55,053 --> 00:30:02,506
Scott: One of them is I got fully legit goods but try to offer a bribe to get the sheriff to open the bag and thus pay you the penalty.

452
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:05,236
Rym: or I want to see the Strategy of no one's done this.

453
00:30:05,377 --> 00:30:08,650
Rym: I've offered like what everyone's always like three cards, maybe four cards.

454
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:15,786
Rym: I would expect at least Occasionally someone to be like one card and it's just the most valuable contraband because the sheriff's like who would?

455
00:30:16,067 --> 00:30:17,540
Rym: who would lie about One?

456
00:30:17,561 --> 00:30:19,436
Scott: no But that's the thing is that you put your.

457
00:30:19,537 --> 00:30:22,370
Scott: when you're trying to sneak contraband in you try to do it with just one.

458
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:25,741
Scott: Because yeah, that's the only way you're getting it through occasionally.

459
00:30:25,761 --> 00:30:28,089
Rym: I've laid down five fucking contraband.

460
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:34,908
Scott: Yeah Well, yeah but I think one thing is that the rules of the game are such that all the goods you legally declared you get to keep Even if they opened it.

461
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:40,754
Scott: So if you want to sneak a contraband in you're better off because you only have Two.

462
00:30:40,935 --> 00:30:44,290
Scott: basically one two times the number of players turns in the game.

463
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,255
Scott: So there's five players.

464
00:30:45,275 --> 00:30:47,870
Scott: you have ten turns two of which are gonna be the sheriff.

465
00:30:48,171 --> 00:30:50,601
Scott: So you only have eight turns in the game to get cards through.

466
00:30:50,621 --> 00:30:52,990
Scott: you got to get as many cards through as possible.

467
00:30:53,531 --> 00:31:00,170
Scott: So if you just spend a turn on one contraband, even if you get it in that's even though that card is real valuable.

468
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,637
Scott: That's not that great.

469
00:31:01,677 --> 00:31:11,530
Scott: You were better off going with like three cheese and a contraband Declaring four cheese and if they open it while I still get my three cheese that turn wasn't a waste.

470
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,841
Rym: So you say that but you're playing the game.

471
00:31:13,921 --> 00:31:17,458
Rym: I think your style and strategy Well, I'll get to this in a second.

472
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:19,510
Rym: the end game of all smart players works.

473
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:34,990
Rym: Um, if like everyone at the table is super fucking pro but In reality, it's like playing Bonanza If I get the one through the sheriff just because of the feel of the game and the way like you want to open bags.

474
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,180
Rym: It feels really good to open someone's back way.

475
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,190
Scott: more fun to open a bag than to give it back to him.

476
00:31:39,611 --> 00:31:45,430
Rym: And I feel like if the sheriff doesn't open any of your playing TSA agent the game or right?

477
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:50,630
Scott: What is it more funny to say go on through come on through or is it more fun to like and look through everyone?

478
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,329
Scott: cases and see what they got.

479
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:59,916
Rym: So I feel like if me another player collude to like put small amounts of stuff through so the sheriff is like eh like he Doesn't bother opening our bags.

480
00:31:59,936 --> 00:32:02,790
Rym: It's probably more likely to open other people's bags.

481
00:32:03,652 --> 00:32:17,307
Scott: If you're a sheriff right someone putting through a small bag, you know, it's like if someone says one I'll open it no matter what because the penalty is gonna be small and it's likely that they're trying to sneak something through right.

482
00:32:17,327 --> 00:32:23,064
Scott: and If they if it isn't something illegal and they only did one it's like fine.

483
00:32:23,104 --> 00:32:24,710
Scott: I'll pay you the penalty of two dollars.

484
00:32:25,015 --> 00:32:25,870
Scott: You're not winning this game.

485
00:32:25,951 --> 00:32:27,929
Scott: Anyway, if you spent a whole turn just to get one cheese

486
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:34,575
Rym: But I've seen people who had a turn where they just put one fucking thing in there come within two or three points of winning Well,

487
00:32:34,596 --> 00:32:36,552
Scott: they basically, you know It's as good

488
00:32:36,592 --> 00:32:36,652
Rym: as

489
00:32:37,054 --> 00:32:38,941
Scott: putting one thing in there and getting it opened.

490
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:41,833
Scott: that's legal is as good as putting two things in and getting Them through.

491
00:32:42,035 --> 00:32:42,337
Rym: Yeah.

492
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:43,989
Rym: Well what he comes down to is this game?

493
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,675
Rym: We haven't fully explored like.

494
00:32:46,996 --> 00:32:47,397
Rym: it's okay.

495
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:49,984
Rym: It's the same brain feel as Bonanza.

496
00:32:50,004 --> 00:32:52,590
Rym: this game serves the same niche of gaming.

497
00:32:52,951 --> 00:32:54,979
Rym: It's a really really social game.

498
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:55,962
Rym: There's a lot of like.

499
00:32:56,264 --> 00:32:57,107
Scott: what's in the bag?

500
00:32:57,127 --> 00:32:58,010
Rym: What's in the bag?

501
00:32:58,771 --> 00:32:59,274
Rym: Like you?

502
00:32:59,294 --> 00:33:06,109
Rym: just you really like people slip barons into the bags like cards from other games Just to fuck with the sheriff and like fun stuff like that.

503
00:33:06,657 --> 00:33:08,273
Rym: The game is super fun just like Bonanza.

504
00:33:08,293 --> 00:33:10,359
Rym: super fun because it's really a vote.

505
00:33:10,379 --> 00:33:11,101
Rym: who wins game?

506
00:33:11,603 --> 00:33:15,094
Rym: in the end of everyone's super smart and it might just be Well, there is.

507
00:33:15,114 --> 00:33:16,659
Scott: it's a very largely vote.

508
00:33:16,699 --> 00:33:17,101
Scott: who wins?

509
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:19,710
Scott: but there's also a large element of luck believe it or not.

510
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:28,642
Scott: Oh, yeah, if you if you just get like telling if you let's say you just keep drawing tons of chickens It's just like well, I'm probably gonna win because I can get these all in legally.

511
00:33:28,663 --> 00:33:30,890
Rym: I say five chickens Sheriff calls bullshit.

512
00:33:31,112 --> 00:33:33,270
Rym: I get you know, ten extra dollars right my chicken.

513
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,233
Scott: It's like you saw.

514
00:33:34,253 --> 00:33:41,949
Scott: if you can consistently put in your bag every turn a large number of legitimate goods of the same type Because your draw was so great.

515
00:33:42,712 --> 00:33:51,041
Scott: It's like you don't need to even try for contraband because you're going to get the points for having most of legal good Whatever, but the same happens in bonanza.

516
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:52,747
Rym: I just happen to keep drawing red beans.

517
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:54,869
Rym: Well, fuck y'all I'm not trading for shit exactly.

518
00:33:55,211 --> 00:34:02,789
Scott: the sheriff is gonna open your bag sometimes at least and you're gonna get extra points for that and You're gonna go these legal goods which are worth a ton of points.

519
00:34:03,092 --> 00:34:04,687
Scott: So it's just like that's.

520
00:34:04,889 --> 00:34:08,641
Scott: you know if you go for the high contraband strategy because that's all you get sure.

521
00:34:08,722 --> 00:34:18,210
Scott: sometimes the sheriff won't open your bag and you'll get a million points and then sometimes they will and You'll have to pay a bunch of money and you'll get zero points that turn because he was all got your pay.

522
00:34:18,511 --> 00:34:25,150
Rym: So, I think basically bonanza is probably one of our favorite most go-to like social games because it's it's a real game.

523
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:29,925
Rym: There is a pretty high luck factor, especially when everyone's good and the game comes down to.

524
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:32,123
Rym: you're playing it with a bunch of friends Who are?

525
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:37,469
Rym: Super super manipulative and the game is this really abstract social game.

526
00:34:38,431 --> 00:34:44,652
Rym: Sheriff of Nottingham is the same brain feel and it breaks down at about the same point like Bonanza.

527
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:52,835
Rym: if you play it too much gets to this point where People toward the end of the game make very like well Scott's winning so I can't trade with him So I'll trade with you and that's very like.

528
00:34:52,855 --> 00:34:54,080
Rym: how many victory points do you have?

529
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:56,710
Rym: they break down at the same level of analysis?

530
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,264
Scott: The thing is okay, let's say you're the sheriff.

531
00:34:59,304 --> 00:35:08,193
Scott: at the end of the game You see who's winning right and you're in second place and it's like do I open their bag and perhaps end up giving them Money and they win?

532
00:35:08,394 --> 00:35:12,290
Scott: or do I not open their bag and then they sneak a bunch of stuff through and they win?

533
00:35:12,731 --> 00:35:14,918
Rym: so one thing sheriff has the bonanza doesn't.

534
00:35:14,998 --> 00:35:23,324
Rym: is that the bonanza trading on lying about like what's actually in your hand and what's coming Up is more about convincing other people who's actually winning and convincing them to trade with you.

535
00:35:23,344 --> 00:35:31,690
Rym: This is more about Distracting people getting them to forget to open your bag or like getting the focus on someone else.

536
00:35:32,112 --> 00:35:39,373
Rym: it's this is a game of redirecting your friends attention and at that is actually a fun game, but I Among.

537
00:35:39,413 --> 00:35:45,478
Rym: if five people who have complete poker faces and act like me and Scott play this game It's the same as bonanza.

538
00:35:45,498 --> 00:35:47,409
Rym: Everyone's like I'll trade you this fuck you.

539
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,457
Scott: Yeah, I'm pretty much my only stress.

540
00:35:49,478 --> 00:35:53,957
Scott: if anyone ever says hey Scott pay me to not open your bag I'm just like I dare you to open my bag.

541
00:35:54,198 --> 00:35:55,284
Scott: I dare you go for it.

542
00:35:55,424 --> 00:35:56,209
Scott: Yeah, what are you gonna do?

543
00:35:56,651 --> 00:35:57,598
Scott: What do you do?

544
00:35:57,659 --> 00:35:59,130
Scott: and it doesn't matter what I've got in there?

545
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,983
Scott: I say the same thing every time.

546
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:03,617
Scott: that way It's just like they don't know what to think.

547
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:10,430
Rym: see but I pay attention to things like when someone draws cards Do they reorder their hand and then where do they draw cards out afterwards?

548
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:17,110
Scott: If you watch if you actually look at other people you'll see like they just take the first three cards because everyone's gonna sort Their hand by good type, right?

549
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:27,810
Scott: So if someone takes the first three cards in their hand and puts them in the bag Okay, those three cards were next to each other They're probably not lying and someone else like well You know three different cards in their hand and puts those in the bag.

550
00:36:27,891 --> 00:36:29,229
Scott: It's like or not even in that.

551
00:36:29,692 --> 00:36:35,349
Rym: What I'll just see is someone will take like two cards out of their hand put them in the bag Then they take another card and put it in the bag.

552
00:36:36,776 --> 00:36:37,469
Scott: Open in that shit.

553
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:45,007
Rym: Yeah, of course at the same time if they were clever and they did that it becomes a poison cup situation And that's where the game breaks down in the end.

554
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:48,010
Scott: Okay, but in the same or put stuff in your bag under the table.

555
00:36:48,051 --> 00:36:49,230
Scott: So no one can see what the fuck you're doing.

556
00:36:49,230 --> 00:37:01,922
Rym: Yeah But much like with games like mafia like yes and very pure analytical players Will take a lot of the fun out of the game, but in practice Despite attempting to play analytically people fuck up.

557
00:37:02,203 --> 00:37:03,890
Rym: They lose attention for a minute.

558
00:37:04,132 --> 00:37:06,430
Rym: They a lot of people forget what they put in their own bag.

559
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,215
Rym: Yeah and the rules are very clear.

560
00:37:08,295 --> 00:37:10,705
Scott: one lot of times the sheriff forgets what people declared.

561
00:37:10,765 --> 00:37:16,205
Scott: like the sheriff like people go to the Chef and like three cheese three apples four chickens one bread.

562
00:37:16,285 --> 00:37:17,410
Scott: It's like what did you have again?

563
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:18,212
Scott: Three cheese?

564
00:37:18,452 --> 00:37:19,134
Scott: was it three cheese.

565
00:37:19,215 --> 00:37:20,378
Scott: I forget but what did you say?

566
00:37:20,398 --> 00:37:23,147
Scott: Yeah, the sheriff doesn't remember what you declared.

567
00:37:23,167 --> 00:37:24,050
Scott: That's a problem.

568
00:37:24,391 --> 00:37:27,141
Rym: So it's a. I think it's a great game to buy.

569
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,807
Rym: it did this and bonanza.

570
00:37:28,867 --> 00:37:31,743
Scott: if you own them both You don't really need anything else in this category.

571
00:37:31,763 --> 00:37:36,730
Rym: if you have those two exactly I mean the only other game in this kind of category at the high level is just mafia.

572
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,163
Rym: You just need the deck of cards for that.

573
00:37:38,183 --> 00:37:48,589
Scott: Yeah You know like we said the theme just goes so well with the mechanic of You're bringing goods into town and the sheriff is opening your bags or not?

574
00:37:49,217 --> 00:37:50,190
Scott: It's so that's you know.

575
00:37:50,271 --> 00:37:52,530
Scott: Not a lot of games can pull off the theme matching.

576
00:37:53,232 --> 00:37:59,750
Rym: So well, the game is also ripe for a small number of very pointed expansions.

577
00:37:59,991 --> 00:38:03,443
Rym: I mean what game isn't like Puerto Rico like.

578
00:38:03,503 --> 00:38:05,430
Rym: expanding it just over complicates it.

579
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:10,022
Rym: Sure, I can try to imagine just quickly a good expansion to Puerto Rico.

580
00:38:10,042 --> 00:38:12,650
Scott: There's some more buildings or something or tickets in your freddy's.

581
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:13,754
Rym: I'm not a big fan of the expanse.

582
00:38:13,774 --> 00:38:15,381
Scott: You can't expand tickets in your freddy's.

583
00:38:15,401 --> 00:38:15,803
Scott: really well.

584
00:38:15,863 --> 00:38:16,807
Scott: It has an expansion.

585
00:38:16,948 --> 00:38:17,510
Scott: That's not good.

586
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:18,574
Scott: Yeah, it's a monument.

587
00:38:18,614 --> 00:38:18,975
Scott: I don't know.

588
00:38:19,015 --> 00:38:20,500
Rym: Yeah, but you're from Nottingham.

589
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,444
Rym: like there's like.

590
00:38:21,464 --> 00:38:22,909
Rym: there's some sort of like dangerous.

591
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:24,593
Rym: good Sure that.

592
00:38:24,613 --> 00:38:25,757
Rym: yeah, like little it's like.

593
00:38:25,797 --> 00:38:27,503
Rym: I don't think that you get like bombs.

594
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:29,550
Scott: like the sheriff opens it they get hurt.

595
00:38:30,252 --> 00:38:31,997
Rym: If the sheriff opens it they get hurt.

596
00:38:32,057 --> 00:38:35,970
Rym: if they don't open it and it goes into your stall you get negative points.

597
00:38:36,632 --> 00:38:37,938
Scott: Yeah, it's good something like that.

598
00:38:38,721 --> 00:38:39,645
Rym: You want to do things.

599
00:38:39,766 --> 00:38:40,690
Rym: the problem is this game.

600
00:38:40,831 --> 00:38:44,410
Rym: It can't be things that just change the analytical side of the game.

601
00:38:44,831 --> 00:38:53,878
Rym: It has to be things that change the psychological side kind of like how in mafia the psycho killer like from a game Theory like game analysis standpoint.

602
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:56,968
Rym: It's pretty straightforward how to use the psycho killer in practice.

603
00:38:57,269 --> 00:38:57,933
Rym: people Just wanted.

604
00:38:58,034 --> 00:39:00,610
Rym: they want to be the psycho killer cuz it's cool.

605
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,596
Rym: Okay, I could kill you just you want.

606
00:39:03,857 --> 00:39:08,550
Rym: you're just waiting to flip that psycho killer over even if it loses you the game.

607
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,226
Rym: So like if someone's got the bomb in their hand.

608
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:17,614
Rym: now There's this like they got to keep their cool even though they've got the rare cool thing and they get to do the cool thing with it.

609
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:25,030
Rym: mm-hmm like The bomb gets discarded and then someone picks the bomb up and then puts their bag with five down.

610
00:39:25,792 --> 00:39:27,670
Scott: Proven to be a popular well-selling game.

611
00:39:27,751 --> 00:39:28,789
Scott: I've seen it around a lot.

612
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:34,266
Scott: So I don't see why it wouldn't get expanded because every other board game that does well gets expanded.

613
00:39:34,567 --> 00:39:39,970
Rym: and also honestly Groups of people playing this game are always having a loud good time.

614
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,507
Scott: Yeah, I've never seen anyone have a bad time playing this even if they lose.

615
00:39:42,668 --> 00:39:50,570
Rym: yeah So seriously this and bonanza own them both and alternate which one you play and they both have infinite replayability together.

616
00:39:51,093 --> 00:39:52,038
Scott: Yeah, I guess you know.

617
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:59,150
Scott: the only thing like I said that's negative about this game Is that there's just so many cards and the deck the drawing is and discarding is a bit fiddly.

618
00:39:59,451 --> 00:40:00,576
Rym: Yeah, the the rule.

619
00:40:00,656 --> 00:40:01,600
Rym: it's weird the rules.

620
00:40:02,082 --> 00:40:08,610
Rym: if someone's a gamer you explain the rules once they're like, okay I get it, but someone who's not like really versed in like German board games and card games and everything.

621
00:40:09,651 --> 00:40:14,450
Rym: They will have a lot of trouble with the drawing and discarding rules until you just demonstrate it in the course of play.

622
00:40:14,611 --> 00:40:16,380
Rym: Yeah, luckily, it doesn't.

623
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:16,863
Rym: you can just.

624
00:40:17,044 --> 00:40:18,270
Rym: you can just demonstrate it in the course of play.

625
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:24,929
Scott: It doesn't affect their decisions very much No, it's just two discard files and it's like they could have made this game with a lot less cards.

626
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:27,017
Rym: probably Yeah, but it doesn't.

627
00:40:27,037 --> 00:40:27,459
Rym: well, I don't know.

628
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,892
Rym: having so many cards, you know It's interesting.

629
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:36,817
Rym: if the game were a little simpler card wise it would be more Analyzable and be less fun in the long run.

630
00:40:36,957 --> 00:40:40,970
Rym: maybe the fact that there's so many cards it pushes the game more toward the psychology.

631
00:40:41,151 --> 00:40:44,084
Scott: Bluffing fucking with your friends just annoying have to deal with all the cards.

632
00:40:44,326 --> 00:40:45,250
Scott: Yeah shuffling them.

633
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,561
Rym: It's hard to rebox it cuz it's just a million fucking cards.

634
00:40:47,581 --> 00:41:01,679
Scott: You can't shuffle them properly at all Yeah, and they always get sorted because like at the end with the game all everyone's You know tableaus or markets are full of legit goods and the discards are full of contrabands Way more contrabands than you can get into your.

635
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:07,650
Rym: what we do is like the people who know how to play the game Just shuffle the deck like crazy split up while someone else.

636
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:16,166
Rym: I think you gotta just take all the cards and do the big wash method for like a few minutes to really mix it up Or at least end of game wash just a little bit before you put it away.

637
00:41:16,206 --> 00:41:16,870
Scott: That's also true.

638
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:19,469
Scott: All right, do you want to talk about mounting your friends?

639
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:28,770
Rym: So really briefly because it doesn't need a huge Mounting your friends is a game that our friend the hitman hard bought us as a gift and made us play sight unseen at a PAX.

640
00:41:29,911 --> 00:41:31,698
Scott: I didn't play it until I got to rims house.

641
00:41:31,918 --> 00:41:34,106
Rym: It is it's it's versus QWOP.

642
00:41:34,307 --> 00:41:35,010
Scott: It's so good.

643
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:49,194
Rym: it is so simple and so good and so cheap that all I will say is you should just buy this game and Whip it out And then mount your friends, yes But it's basically.

644
00:41:49,214 --> 00:41:52,384
Rym: you need an Xbox controller plugged into yours just one.

645
00:41:52,404 --> 00:41:54,350
Scott: you pass it around only one person takes it.

646
00:41:54,551 --> 00:41:55,554
Rym: It has all these other modes.

647
00:41:55,574 --> 00:42:03,750
Rym: you can explore that but just there's a mode where it's just add all your name all your friends Into the game and you just take turns trying to climb on top of each other, right?

648
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:05,761
Scott: It's a QWOP controls at the start of the game.

649
00:42:06,002 --> 00:42:18,643
Scott: What sort of QWOP ish controls right up and basically the controls are you press on what each one of the buttons the four face buttons a bxy Corresponds to a limb arm arm leg leg or hand hand foot foot actually.

650
00:42:19,084 --> 00:42:26,910
Scott: and then when you press one of those buttons down use The analog stick to move that limb or appendage and you could only move one appendage at a time.

651
00:42:27,353 --> 00:42:35,070
Scott: And you have sort of a weird goofy model dude Who's got some junk and stuff and you move them around and at the start of the game?

652
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:38,130
Scott: There's a goat and a goat just is just a thing.

653
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:43,970
Scott: It just sits there and you have basically to get onto the goat and get some part of your body above the white line.

654
00:42:44,713 --> 00:42:47,575
Scott: And then once you're above the white line You can press start.

655
00:42:47,656 --> 00:43:10,370
Scott: and if you press start while any part of you is above the white line or enough of you is above The white line you have succeeded in mounting and the next player now can begin and they have to get above the new white line Which is now higher and they have to mount not on top on you on top of you Right, and then the next person is to mount on top of them because the white line keeps getting higher So you can't just like sort of mount onto the side.

656
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:17,850
Scott: You got a climb on top of everyone that has climbed before and Successfully, press start while enough of you is above the ever rising line.

657
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:21,370
Scott: It's sort of like a reverse limbo in a way human pyramid situation.

658
00:43:22,055 --> 00:43:23,950
Scott: But the thing is is a time limit.

659
00:43:24,391 --> 00:43:33,730
Scott: So it's like it's not easy to control this person with these weird control scheme and you got to get them up there Which is easy enough, but not easy with this time limit.

660
00:43:34,092 --> 00:43:45,255
Scott: the other thing is that some people spawn on the left and some people spawn on the right and Also, if there's an odd number of players someone's gonna alternate between left and right spawns When you mount.

661
00:43:45,335 --> 00:43:58,009
Scott: you might like try to create a pyramid like leans to the right or leans to the left Making it much harder for people who spawn on that side to mount Because they have much much farther to travel to get above the line.

662
00:43:58,753 --> 00:44:01,626
Rym: There are tons of other modes and the game is just it's.

663
00:44:01,706 --> 00:44:06,007
Rym: it's another one of those things The games that are really break out in the last several years on.

664
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:14,518
Rym: Like like PC games and video games for me have been these very very simple Directly competitive games.

665
00:44:14,879 --> 00:44:17,690
Rym: It's like this reimagining of Atari combat.

666
00:44:18,393 --> 00:44:21,850
Rym: Every game that's just a reimagining of Atari combat that is well designed.

667
00:44:22,472 --> 00:44:26,790
Rym: It's just like they're my favorite games lately and I feel like there's been a renaissance of this kind of game.

668
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:35,128
Rym: So it's a great game because it is skill based But it's also funny and fun enough to where no one's gonna feel super bad when they lose.

669
00:44:35,148 --> 00:44:40,567
Scott: Yep It would be awesome If you had a bunch of people just play in it because it's so silly and they could.

670
00:44:40,848 --> 00:44:44,950
Scott: you know Even people who are not very good could still mount a few times and have a good time.

671
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:45,249
Scott: You know what?

672
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:56,270
Scott: this is also great if you have a bunch of people who are really freaking good at it because it would be so epic in A reverse Jenga sort of way when everyone's mounting way high and it gets real tense the game.

673
00:44:56,833 --> 00:44:58,864
Rym: So, oh my god, the coins have dicks on them too.

674
00:44:59,105 --> 00:44:59,347
Rym: Yes.

675
00:44:59,427 --> 00:44:59,950
Rym: Yeah, there's dicks.

676
00:45:00,091 --> 00:45:05,639
Rym: yeah, so but you can turn them into grapes if you don't want to see the the Poorly animated dick swinging around.

677
00:45:06,242 --> 00:45:16,428
Rym: but this is the kind of game Like if you're having a party like at your place with a bunch of friends just have this on our TV With the controller laying there and just let people play it.

678
00:45:21,722 --> 00:45:24,260
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

679
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:29,040
