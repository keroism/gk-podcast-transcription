1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,180
Rym: It's Monday, September 25th, 2023.

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:10,340
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:13,729
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,315
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,335 --> 00:00:19,090
Rym: We are talking about search engines and why they kind of don't fucking work anymore.

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,007
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:23,556
Rym: Yeah, I skipped a bunch of shows.

8
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:24,520
Rym: A lot's happened.

9
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:26,770
Rym: I spent the weekend in Michigan.

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:33,210
Rym: Well, I spent like a couple days in Michigan in like a whirlwind tour to see a bunch of family.

11
00:00:33,772 --> 00:00:37,949
Rym: Many of whom I haven't seen since COVID happened because that really put the kibosh on travel.

12
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:44,690
Rym: Coupled with, we got sick earlier in the year and had to miss a wedding, so people we were going to see at the wedding we also hadn't seen.

13
00:00:45,593 --> 00:00:47,870
Rym: So we went back and we saw basically everyone.

14
00:00:49,475 --> 00:00:50,310
Rym: And it was a really good time.

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,390
Rym: But the thing, there was this weird thing that happened on the flight.

16
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:56,769
Rym: And I don't know if it's a Michigan thing.

17
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:58,909
Scott: At least your flight went and came back.

18
00:00:59,010 --> 00:00:59,391
Scott: Oh, yeah.

19
00:00:59,832 --> 00:01:02,219
Rym: So our second flight was so far ahead of schedule.

20
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,510
Rym: They're like, yeah, they actually gave us a ground stop because if we took off now, we'd get to JFK too early.

21
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,928
Rym: They wouldn't have a slot for us to land in.

22
00:01:08,312 --> 00:01:09,888
Rym: So we're going to sit here and wait and take off later.

23
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:14,129
Rym: And you'll get there at the same time because we're going to make up time in the air.

24
00:01:15,056 --> 00:01:15,449
Scott: That's fine.

25
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:15,979
Rym: Yeah.

26
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:26,490
Scott: I don't know if it's just me, but it feels like every time I've ever flown in a plane, there's a reported departure and landing time, right?

27
00:01:26,732 --> 00:01:29,270
Scott: The estimated time of departure and estimated time of arrival.

28
00:01:30,293 --> 00:01:33,450
Scott: And every single time, I think literally a hundred percent.

29
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,710
Rym: Departure is the moment you disengage from the gate.

30
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:39,171
Scott: Right.

31
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:49,150
Scott: But the point is the estimated time of arrival on the flight that has not been delayed, has not been canceled, the original time.

32
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,069
Rym: The one where there's nothing hinky going on.

33
00:01:51,473 --> 00:01:51,930
Scott: Exactly.

34
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:59,010
Scott: Every single time that I've flown in a plane somewhere and there were no problems, it just took off and landed.

35
00:01:59,710 --> 00:01:59,810
Scott: Right.

36
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:08,470
Scott: We always land pretty significantly ahead of the estimated time of arrival, at least 15 minutes, like a somewhat significant amount of time.

37
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,090
Scott: Sometimes I think at least a half hour could be right.

38
00:02:11,691 --> 00:02:24,930
Scott: It's like they always, it seems like every single airline, at least in the United States, but also I've gone to other countries once or twice, right, are always padding out that time at the end to some extent.

39
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,710
Scott: And the plane is going faster and making up time somewhere.

40
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:30,511
Rym: Yep.

41
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:30,932
Rym: Hardly.

42
00:02:30,992 --> 00:02:38,830
Rym: I think it's due to the fact that like JFK has often terrible problems where even a plane gets here on time, it can't land because JFK is like overcapacity.

43
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:47,290
Scott: Well, JFK is I think the least on time airport and I think LaGuardia is the second least on time airport, at least in the United States.

44
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,574
Rym: Poseidon, do not strike me down.

45
00:02:51,034 --> 00:02:59,910
Rym: I am not better than the gods, but I have almost no problems with flights being like, it's so rare that a flight is later delayed and I fly kind of often between work and family stuff.

46
00:03:00,451 --> 00:03:00,671
Scott: Yeah.

47
00:03:00,711 --> 00:03:06,899
Scott: I mean, you know, it is pretty rare, but you know, it's like the only.

48
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:14,590
Scott: I think the only times I've had a problem were, you know, the time we discussed on the last episode and which my cousin is trying to get home from Rochester.

49
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:21,944
Rym: A bunch of my family, I realize they watch the live streams or they listen to GeekNights and everyone was asking me like, oh, how's Scott?

50
00:03:22,004 --> 00:03:24,289
Rym: Like, that was quite a trouble he had.

51
00:03:25,152 --> 00:03:25,856
Scott: Okay.

52
00:03:26,117 --> 00:03:28,490
Scott: My family has not mentioned GeekNights ever.

53
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:29,631
Rym: Yep.

54
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:30,292
Rym: Hi, Mom.

55
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:41,147
Rym: So, but one weird thing happened on this flight and I've never seen this happen ever in my life flying, but two caveats.

56
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:43,630
Rym: Most of my flying was an unruly passenger.

57
00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:45,093
Rym: I've seen that.

58
00:03:45,293 --> 00:03:49,362
Rym: I've seen someone get hauled off in handcuffs before the flight.

59
00:03:49,623 --> 00:03:52,730
Scott: Some of the flight crews are actually protesting because of unruly passengers.

60
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,512
Rym: Oh, yeah.

61
00:03:53,652 --> 00:03:53,973
Rym: It's a...

62
00:03:54,073 --> 00:03:55,095
Scott: Becoming a bigger problem.

63
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:59,324
Rym: It is actually the data shows it is becoming a problem at a catastrophic rate.

64
00:03:59,584 --> 00:04:01,168
Rym: And you know what is rising at the same rate?

65
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:02,210
Rym: Road rage.

66
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,371
Scott: Yeah.

67
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:04,012
Rym: Yeah.

68
00:04:04,493 --> 00:04:05,535
Rym: But no, nothing like that.

69
00:04:05,595 --> 00:04:10,804
Scott: I feel like if you're an unruly passenger or road rage, you should just be perma-banned.

70
00:04:10,845 --> 00:04:11,566
Scott: No recourse.

71
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:12,407
Scott: No comebacks.

72
00:04:12,427 --> 00:04:12,648
Scott: The end.

73
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:22,565
Rym: If you commit an aggressive road rage action as a car, you should never be able to pilot a car again for the rest of your life with no recourse.

74
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:24,708
Scott: No matter what you do, it's like too bad.

75
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:25,790
Scott: No second chance, right?

76
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:37,710
Rym: Maybe if you get a panel of doctors to prove that you had a mental break or a problem and that it is now resolved and that you're a healthy, happy member of society able to re-operate a vehicle.

77
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,395
Rym: But if you committed it just because you're a raging dickhead, nah, you never get it again.

78
00:04:42,757 --> 00:04:46,943
Rym: But no, this was... So the caveat is that most of my flying is for work.

79
00:04:47,023 --> 00:04:51,610
Rym: So most of my flying is in business class where there's often stuff going on in the back of the plane.

80
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:56,519
Rym: Like I can hear all sorts of troubles, but just I'm in a different part of the plane behind that little thing.

81
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:03,090
Rym: So on both our flight to Detroit and our flight from Detroit, a whole bunch of people just sat in the wrong seats.

82
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:07,357
Rym: Like they had a ticket with a seat and they just sat in a different seat.

83
00:05:07,818 --> 00:05:10,943
Rym: and then someone comes up and they're like, uh, you're in my seat.

84
00:05:11,403 --> 00:05:15,530
Rym: And then the person who's in the wrong seat, uh, it's not a matter of, oh, sorry.

85
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,171
Rym: And they move.

86
00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:18,274
Rym: They then say, oh, well, I wanted to sit here.

87
00:05:18,314 --> 00:05:19,756
Rym: Do you want to take my seat instead?

88
00:05:20,097 --> 00:05:21,940
Rym: And they try to point them at their much shittier seat.

89
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:28,550
Rym: I saw this happen with five different people on our flight to Detroit and two different people on our flight from Detroit.

90
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,251
Scott: Yeah.

91
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:35,398
Scott: I mean, you know, people, cause the airlines, if you buy the cheapest ticket does not let you pick your seat.

92
00:05:35,778 --> 00:05:44,710
Scott: And people basically, this is, I think a fun, I've noticed this cause I've been, uh, I guess foolishly reading too much of the, am I the asshole subreddit?

93
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,823
Rym: It's a, it's a, it's like staring into a train wreck, but a really interesting train wreck.

94
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:50,745
Rym: And it's hard.

95
00:05:51,387 --> 00:05:52,550
Rym: I also gaze into that a bit.

96
00:05:52,570 --> 00:06:01,783
Scott: It's like judge Judy, if Judy was the internet anyway, so the, um, but basically there's a lot of people who think they're the asshole or are the asshole.

97
00:06:02,023 --> 00:06:02,304
Scott: Right.

98
00:06:02,785 --> 00:06:06,590
Scott: And it has to do with basically people being right.

99
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:11,417
Scott: Conflict averse or people pleasers or unwill.

100
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:11,718
Scott: Right.

101
00:06:11,818 --> 00:06:18,289
Scott: And it's like, or does the people who are like people who won't stand up for what's right and just say, let's keep the peace.

102
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:18,830
Scott: Right.

103
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,436
Scott: You know, they're like, just apologize so we can end this conflict.

104
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:23,558
Scott: I just don't want to fight.

105
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:30,650
Rym: I see where you're going with this because 100% of these interactions, the person didn't fight and just went and sat in the shittier seat.

106
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:31,710
Scott: Right.

107
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:42,747
Scott: So it's basically when you have, so a person who doesn't want to fight, doesn't want to cause conflict, that sort of attitude, that person is usually a good person, right?

108
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:43,728
Scott: They have a good heart.

109
00:06:43,788 --> 00:06:44,790
Scott: They don't want to hurt people.

110
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,032
Scott: They don't, they're not angry.

111
00:06:46,513 --> 00:06:46,773
Scott: Right.

112
00:06:46,793 --> 00:06:53,243
Rym: The problem is the kind of person who worries that they're the asshole is less likely to be the asshole.

113
00:06:53,824 --> 00:06:54,044
Scott: Yeah.

114
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:58,050
Scott: I mean, I think I'd say the majority of people in that subreddit get a, not the asshole vote.

115
00:06:58,891 --> 00:06:59,952
Scott: But there are plenty who do.

116
00:07:00,012 --> 00:07:08,120
Scott: But the point is, is that when you have that attitude, right, of not fighting, not willing to stand up for yourself, cowardice, right?

117
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:18,250
Scott: You're a good person, but in being a coward, you are enabling the assholes and basically making assholes win.

118
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:25,384
Rym: Oh, remember that chart of the ladder, not the bad ladder theory, but the, the stupid people, bandits, suckers, et cetera.

119
00:07:25,624 --> 00:07:28,650
Rym: Those people are the suckers who are exactly by the bandits.

120
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:29,451
Scott: Right.

121
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:34,997
Scott: So it's like, you know, I could probably, you could go, if you have a lot of guts, right.

122
00:07:35,057 --> 00:07:37,439
Scott: You could go and sit in like a first class seat.

123
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,040
Scott: Right.

124
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:50,474
Scott: And if the person who, who paid for that seat is too much of a coward to actually go and ask the flight attendant to kick you out of the seat, you can just get a first class ticket for free and be a huge asshole.

125
00:07:50,675 --> 00:08:02,330
Rym: Now, the caveat being, I am confident that that is the situation where the person sitting in that seat is more likely to be a Karen than the average person and still have an immovable object fighting against another movable object.

126
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,050
Rym: It'll be sure.

127
00:08:03,391 --> 00:08:03,631
Scott: Right.

128
00:08:03,671 --> 00:08:10,015
Scott: But, you know, you get the idea is that if you are one of those good people who is afraid of conflict.

129
00:08:10,276 --> 00:08:10,556
Scott: Right.

130
00:08:10,896 --> 00:08:11,957
Scott: I encourage you.

131
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:12,857
Scott: Right.

132
00:08:13,338 --> 00:08:16,360
Scott: Obviously, you know, you're not going to have the spoons to do this all the time.

133
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:16,780
Scott: Right.

134
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,761
Scott: Because of your nature.

135
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:18,841
Scott: And I understand that.

136
00:08:18,942 --> 00:08:22,524
Scott: But be courageous as much as you can.

137
00:08:22,924 --> 00:08:23,184
Scott: Right.

138
00:08:23,425 --> 00:08:31,190
Scott: As much as you are able, stand up for yourself and for what is right, even if it creates an uncomfortable conflict.

139
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:31,951
Scott: Right.

140
00:08:32,191 --> 00:08:45,039
Scott: And you have to tell on someone or argue or, you know, I understand that for some people, like if you're a black person or a not white person, that's going to put you in a dangerous situation.

141
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,020
Scott: Right.

142
00:08:46,520 --> 00:09:00,630
Scott: But do it as much as it is as you are safe and able to do so, because every time you do it, you know, every time you don't do it, basically evil people are just getting free wins and becoming more emboldened to do.

143
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,495
Scott: Whether it's small things like stealing your seat on a plane.

144
00:09:05,016 --> 00:09:05,276
Scott: Right.

145
00:09:05,717 --> 00:09:07,079
Scott: Or much bigger things.

146
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:07,760
Scott: Right.

147
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,863
Scott: Like, you know, controlling our society.

148
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,627
Scott: You're winning a big evil business deals.

149
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:13,208
Scott: Right.

150
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:14,870
Scott: All kinds of things like that.

151
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,274
Rym: And I guess the other thing about this trip that was interesting is I remembered a heuristic.

152
00:09:20,654 --> 00:09:22,957
Rym: That is, it took me a long time.

153
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:25,840
Rym: Like, it really fucked me up when I moved to Rochester and in New York.

154
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,003
Rym: Like, this heuristic will sound insane.

155
00:09:28,663 --> 00:09:31,907
Rym: But driving in Michigan again, because we landed, what are you going to do?

156
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:32,367
Rym: Rent a car?

157
00:09:32,387 --> 00:09:33,949
Rym: There's literally no other way to get around.

158
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:34,730
Rym: Nope.

159
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:42,156
Rym: So the heuristic in Michigan, and this also applies to a big chunk of Ohio and Wisconsin and even Indiana is.

160
00:09:42,617 --> 00:09:48,001
Rym: however far, if you want to guess how long it'll take you to get anywhere, take the number of miles away it is.

161
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:48,862
Rym: It's that many minutes.

162
00:09:49,182 --> 00:09:51,604
Rym: And that is like, so accurate.

163
00:09:51,685 --> 00:09:52,405
Rym: It's shocking.

164
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:58,050
Scott: And it was exactly 60 miles an hour is a mile a minute.

165
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,534
Rym: And the speed limit on freeways is 70 miles an hour, but there'll be a little traffic.

166
00:10:01,554 --> 00:10:02,395
Rym: So it kind of evens out.

167
00:10:02,656 --> 00:10:08,223
Rym: But also because it's a grid, there's basically a nearly unlimited number of ways to get anywhere.

168
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:10,486
Rym: because you just go, you follow the grid.

169
00:10:10,886 --> 00:10:14,030
Rym: And if there's traffic, you kind of just go around the traffic and it all evens out.

170
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:18,815
Rym: And a mile a minute ends up being a really accurate heuristic.

171
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:28,003
Rym: And I remember being late to stuff a lot when I first moved to Rochester before I realized that there are places where there's only one or two roads that go between one place and another place.

172
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,407
Rym: Granted, ban all these roads.

173
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:34,870
Rym: I hate those freeways, but they work for car people.

174
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:37,390
Scott: Anyway.

175
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:38,351
Scott: Yeah.

176
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:39,652
Scott: So I did a lot of stuff.

177
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:46,817
Scott: I guess I'll just, you know, I'll just dump all my opening bits now, make them all short because otherwise they'll be forgotten for the next episode.

178
00:10:46,857 --> 00:10:53,362
Scott: So since the last time we did GeekNights, I went to see Death Clock and Babymetal at the same concert.

179
00:10:54,122 --> 00:10:55,984
Scott: This is the third time I saw Babymetal.

180
00:10:56,164 --> 00:10:56,404
Scott: Right.

181
00:10:56,464 --> 00:10:58,666
Scott: And it's like, it's not any different.

182
00:10:58,706 --> 00:11:02,288
Scott: Basically, they have some, you know, are they my favorite metal band?

183
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:02,528
Scott: No.

184
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:03,009
Scott: Right.

185
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:04,009
Scott: Do I like them?

186
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:04,870
Scott: Yeah, I like them quite a lot.

187
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,250
Scott: Quite a bit.

188
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:06,692
Scott: But they have some way.

189
00:11:06,772 --> 00:11:18,666
Scott: I don't know what the hell they're doing where they could just make everybody, all kinds of people, all shapes and sizes and ages come together and everyone loses their mind more than the usual amount.

190
00:11:19,027 --> 00:11:19,287
Scott: Right.

191
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:21,650
Scott: I don't know how they have something going on.

192
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:29,496
Scott: So if you see if you get another opportunity to see their show, even if you hate metal, it's you should probably go to my opinion.

193
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,317
Scott: Second thing that happened.

194
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:36,161
Scott: I don't know if I talked about the Affordable Art Fair when I went.

195
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:44,528
Scott: I thought I had gone a year ago, but apparently it's every six months and I went six months ago and I'm like, wait, we only went six months ago.

196
00:11:44,588 --> 00:11:45,588
Scott: Why did I come back again?

197
00:11:45,628 --> 00:11:47,410
Scott: I don't need to see affordable art that often.

198
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:52,893
Scott: But I did see some interesting arts there.

199
00:11:54,494 --> 00:12:04,842
Scott: One of them, there was somebody who I guess there is family owns one of those hotels in Wildwood and lives in Delaware.

200
00:12:04,862 --> 00:12:05,383
Scott: All right.

201
00:12:05,483 --> 00:12:14,590
Scott: And basically his art was he would go to Wildwood in the off season when no one was there and take, you know, like photos and then print them out.

202
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:20,899
Scott: He has a photo of like one of the hotels with snow all around and obviously no one there because it's off season.

203
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,842
Scott: And apparently that's a big seller.

204
00:12:23,002 --> 00:12:25,326
Scott: And I was like, I recognize these photos and ask the person.

205
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:26,849
Scott: I'm like, are these from Wildwood, New Jersey?

206
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:27,450
Scott: They're like, yeah.

207
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,572
Scott: Core brothers sign line on the ground.

208
00:12:30,652 --> 00:12:33,175
Scott: OK, I went to.

209
00:12:33,255 --> 00:12:35,798
Scott: I wrote about in the forum, our forum.

210
00:12:35,818 --> 00:12:39,142
Scott: So if you want to know what I have to say, I won't waste your time here.

211
00:12:39,202 --> 00:12:41,705
Scott: You can go read in our forum where I wrote.

212
00:12:42,606 --> 00:12:46,610
Scott: I went to the newly renovated by Netflix Paris theater.

213
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:47,171
Scott: Oh, yeah.

214
00:12:47,191 --> 00:12:56,503
Scott: To see the triple are to see RRR, which if you haven't heard of that, go look, just go to YouTube, type in the letter R three times in a row.

215
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:56,903
Scott: That's it.

216
00:12:56,923 --> 00:12:59,407
Scott: It's like something trailer instead of something Beetlejuice.

217
00:12:59,427 --> 00:13:02,030
Rym: You've you've some in a very fantastic movie.

218
00:13:02,811 --> 00:13:08,910
Scott: If you see a trailer for a movie from India with a tiger in the thumbnail, probably that's what you're looking for.

219
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:16,900
Rym: That's the kind of movie where if we had seen one frame from it at any point at RIT, like had it existed, we would have definitely watched it as fast as possible.

220
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,400
Scott: Oh, yeah.

221
00:13:17,721 --> 00:13:18,421
Scott: Let me come on.

222
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:21,004
Scott: Like, you know, I think it's probably it's.

223
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:25,630
Scott: it's obviously more action oriented and longer and has more singing and dancing.

224
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:31,742
Scott: Not that it does not, but, you know, it has that same fun of attack the gas station, right?

225
00:13:31,802 --> 00:13:34,748
Scott: Of ridiculous, of live action, ridiculousness, right?

226
00:13:34,768 --> 00:13:35,770
Scott: And preposterousness.

227
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:41,136
Scott: But it's way it's like ten thousand times better than attack the gas station.

228
00:13:41,156 --> 00:13:50,449
Scott: But regardless, they this audio in that theater, they basically put in the best projectors and best sound system that is currently available in the world.

229
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:50,910
Scott: Right.

230
00:13:51,751 --> 00:13:55,354
Scott: I think they said there were like over five hundred speakers or something in there at most.

231
00:13:56,635 --> 00:14:01,239
Scott: And they're like, yeah, we're we're showing this movie mostly to flex our sound system.

232
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:01,480
Scott: Right.

233
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,401
Scott: This will be the movie that really test it out.

234
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:12,810
Scott: And it's like, you know, it wasn't so much, you know, at most is is really they advertise it as being about, you know, the positional this right.

235
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,653
Scott: And they're sure enough, there are speakers on every surface in the theater.

236
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:17,453
Scott: Right.

237
00:14:18,114 --> 00:14:19,795
Scott: So sounds come from all directions.

238
00:14:20,315 --> 00:14:31,263
Scott: But what it really I think what it is, is that when they have that many speakers and that level of power, first of all, they can get really loud without any kind of distortion.

239
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:31,823
Scott: Right.

240
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,005
Scott: So I definitely got permanent hearing damage of some kind.

241
00:14:35,206 --> 00:14:35,346
Scott: Right.

242
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:37,367
Scott: It was that the Apple Watch complained immediately.

243
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:39,348
Rym: That is a sign of a very good movie.

244
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:40,549
Rym: Problems notwithstanding.

245
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:41,530
Scott: Right.

246
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:45,395
Scott: But the second thing is that, you know, there's a lot of music in that movie.

247
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:50,983
Scott: And I noticed this in particular during one of the big dancing scene.

248
00:14:51,003 --> 00:14:55,069
Scott: where there's a there is a drum, like an actual drum set that someone is playing.

249
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:55,510
Scott: Right.

250
00:14:56,171 --> 00:15:01,195
Scott: And even when you have like audio file level speakers at someone's house.

251
00:15:01,496 --> 00:15:01,776
Scott: Right.

252
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:08,943
Scott: It's like you can still somehow tell the difference between I'm at the symphony and a guy hit the timpani.

253
00:15:08,963 --> 00:15:09,623
Scott: Right.

254
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:13,087
Scott: And a recording of a guy hitting a timpani.

255
00:15:13,707 --> 00:15:13,928
Scott: Right.

256
00:15:14,268 --> 00:15:16,190
Scott: It doesn't sound exactly the same.

257
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:22,115
Scott: It's like even with the highest lossless recording and the fanciest speakers.

258
00:15:22,195 --> 00:15:22,415
Scott: Right.

259
00:15:23,216 --> 00:15:24,798
Scott: But in that theater, it sounded the same.

260
00:15:25,438 --> 00:15:25,679
Scott: Right.

261
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:31,324
Scott: You could play you could record the symphony if you recorded and mastered the symphony correctly.

262
00:15:31,645 --> 00:15:36,429
Scott: You could sit in that theater and close your eyes and believe you were at the live symphony.

263
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,531
Scott: And, you know, I haven't been blown.

264
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:42,033
Scott: I mean, they hyped it, but I guess the hype was real.

265
00:15:42,073 --> 00:15:48,338
Scott: I hadn't been hit that hard by a movie theater sound system since the first time I saw a THX logo.

266
00:15:48,378 --> 00:15:49,039
Rym: Good to know.

267
00:15:49,699 --> 00:16:00,948
Scott: If there is a movie that would benefit from the ridiculous sound system, I would recommend going to the Paris theater in Manhattan, New York City, if you can reach it.

268
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:03,810
Rym: Or you could see a Nolan film and maybe understand what anyone's saying.

269
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,414
Scott: Yeah, I tell you, whoever mixed it, whatever, it was.

270
00:16:08,574 --> 00:16:09,795
Scott: it was crystal clear.

271
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,156
Scott: I could hear everything.

272
00:16:11,176 --> 00:16:16,742
Scott: It was like at the correct volume, whether it was an explosion or talking or anything, it was.

273
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:18,324
Scott: it was immaculate.

274
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:22,709
Scott: So and that's what I did between the last show and now.

275
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:23,189
Scott: All right.

276
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:24,090
Scott: It is worthy of note.

277
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,332
Rym: And for some reason, I thought that Janelle Monae concert was later.

278
00:16:27,392 --> 00:16:28,713
Rym: So there's still tickets tomorrow.

279
00:16:28,753 --> 00:16:30,174
Rym: We might just buy some tickets and go tomorrow.

280
00:16:30,194 --> 00:16:31,335
Rym: So stay tuned.

281
00:16:31,435 --> 00:16:32,176
Scott: I'm going to.

282
00:16:32,236 --> 00:16:34,818
Scott: it's like I bought tickets a long time ago and it's tomorrow.

283
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:35,398
Rym: Not sold out.

284
00:16:35,478 --> 00:16:37,580
Rym: seats that are perfectly affordable.

285
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,381
Scott: It's not sold out.

286
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:40,382
Scott: I'm like, it's not sold out.

287
00:16:40,402 --> 00:16:41,662
Scott: Well, Radio City is enormous.

288
00:16:41,722 --> 00:16:42,043
Scott: Oh, yeah.

289
00:16:42,063 --> 00:16:46,866
Scott: There's a lot of seats, but so I was like, oh, it's not sold out.

290
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:52,310
Scott: So I told her, you know, I thought I was, you know, I see you there tomorrow.

291
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:59,034
Rym: It's funny, as I as I get older, I can't always tell what will be popular or what will not be like even gig nights panels like in a con.

292
00:16:59,095 --> 00:17:04,117
Rym: Now it's like it's either going to be nobody comes to this or the room is full and there's like no middle ground.

293
00:17:04,417 --> 00:17:06,859
Rym: But I can't predict which is which anymore.

294
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:09,441
Rym: Yeah, maybe that's a sign of oldening.

295
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,762
Rym: All right.

296
00:17:11,843 --> 00:17:14,744
Rym: In some, I guess, tech news that is Monday.

297
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:18,207
Rym: So first off, there's a bunch of these all at once.

298
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:19,208
Rym: So we'll just merge it all together.

299
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,210
Rym: One big news earlier this month on like September 8th.

300
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:32,898
Rym: There was a zero day or at least an unpatched and exploited in the wild vulnerability in iPhones like iOS devices.

301
00:17:33,358 --> 00:17:40,704
Rym: That was really serious in that it required zero click, zero interaction.

302
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:44,487
Rym: It could be triggered by something as simple as seeing an image embedded in a Web site.

303
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:45,288
Scott: Right.

304
00:17:45,308 --> 00:17:48,510
Scott: So this was actually if it's the Web P1 that you're talking about.

305
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:48,750
Rym: Yep.

306
00:17:49,171 --> 00:17:59,502
Scott: So this affected, I think, literally every software that had that displayed Web P images, because there's basically like one library for rendering Web P like the Google one.

307
00:17:59,903 --> 00:18:02,365
Scott: And it's like, you know, it's sort of like SQLite.

308
00:18:02,586 --> 00:18:02,786
Scott: Right.

309
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:06,410
Scott: It's like everyone just embeds the source code to SQLite in their own program.

310
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:06,710
Scott: Yeah.

311
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:11,433
Scott: So everyone has the Web P image decoding code in their program.

312
00:18:11,473 --> 00:18:13,174
Scott: So there's a problem in that code.

313
00:18:13,715 --> 00:18:16,477
Scott: Everyone needs to update their programs and redeploy.

314
00:18:16,657 --> 00:18:16,917
Scott: Right.

315
00:18:17,377 --> 00:18:22,641
Scott: And so the the the core Web P image decoder had a security vulnerability in it.

316
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:26,703
Scott: And so like every software in the universe is like Russia.

317
00:18:26,764 --> 00:18:38,790
Scott: It was that serious that you could just if you could get someone to display your Web P image that was infected, that like literally they visit your Web site that has the evil Web P. They could theoretically do evil stuff.

318
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:39,150
Rym: Yeah.

319
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:44,797
Rym: The specific payload and the other the other three zero days I'm about to talk about had a similar vulnerability.

320
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:54,510
Rym: They all are most commonly used by evil people to deploy things like the Pegasus spying software, which is used by governments and mobs.

321
00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:06,019
Scott: So, yeah, update if you have devices or browsers or any sort of, you know, all your computers, all your phones, all your tablets, update them right now.

322
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:08,221
Scott: And if you like, this is serious.

323
00:19:08,321 --> 00:19:18,850
Scott: If you have an older device that has browsers and, you know, like a smart TV or an antenna, you know, and and they render Web P images.

324
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:22,175
Scott: I mean, you probably shouldn't use those devices anyway if they can't be updated.

325
00:19:22,196 --> 00:19:22,656
Scott: Right.

326
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:23,097
Rym: Yeah.

327
00:19:23,277 --> 00:19:26,763
Scott: But, you know, an old iPhone that is it hasn't doesn't use the.

328
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:29,387
Rym: if you have an iPhone that can't get updates anymore.

329
00:19:29,508 --> 00:19:30,028
Rym: Death sentence.

330
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:30,990
Scott: Right.

331
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:36,440
Scott: It's like basically if you have any such device that does not update.

332
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:36,941
Scott: Right.

333
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,484
Scott: And it's not just because of this issue.

334
00:19:38,524 --> 00:19:41,750
Scott: Just in general, do not use that device.

335
00:19:42,771 --> 00:19:45,374
Scott: First of all, a better off, just don't connect to the Internet.

336
00:19:45,454 --> 00:19:53,062
Scott: But if you do connect it to the Internet, do not put any personal or serious sensitive information on that device.

337
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,465
Scott: Don't do anything with that device.

338
00:19:55,545 --> 00:19:59,229
Scott: That could be that involves your personal information anyway.

339
00:19:59,249 --> 00:19:59,850
Scott: Right.

340
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,574
Scott: You can use it to like play some old games or something.

341
00:20:02,754 --> 00:20:03,375
Scott: Maybe.

342
00:20:03,675 --> 00:20:03,936
Scott: Right.

343
00:20:04,116 --> 00:20:04,557
Scott: It's fine.

344
00:20:04,677 --> 00:20:04,897
Scott: Right.

345
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:08,302
Scott: But, you know, especially if those games will run on something newer.

346
00:20:08,682 --> 00:20:14,090
Scott: But don't use those older unpatched devices for any serious business.

347
00:20:14,751 --> 00:20:24,923
Rym: Now, the sort of the underlying story here is that zero day, zero interaction vulnerabilities like this have been relatively rare historically.

348
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:30,630
Rym: And even if they've existed, they've been relatively rarely exploited historically.

349
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,353
Rym: A lot of times they have.

350
00:20:32,414 --> 00:20:40,049
Scott: also a lot of times people follow procedures where they discover them, they report them, they fix them, and then they announce them after that.

351
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:40,550
Scott: And so.

352
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:48,585
Rym: But coupled with that, Apple devices, for a lot of reasons that we don't need to get into, have often historically had fewer such vulnerabilities.

353
00:20:49,487 --> 00:20:50,910
Rym: None of those things are true anymore.

354
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,992
Rym: These kinds of vulnerabilities are going to happen all the time now.

355
00:20:54,273 --> 00:21:02,779
Rym: They're only going to get worse for a lot of reasons, including state sponsored entities with like the US's three letter organizations.

356
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:12,046
Rym: But imagine those organizations in every other country on Earth are spending a lot of time, effort and money trying to engage in basically cyber warfare.

357
00:21:12,907 --> 00:21:14,588
Rym: And they're very well funded.

358
00:21:14,768 --> 00:21:16,790
Rym: And there's no way to eliminate this kind of vulnerability.

359
00:21:17,511 --> 00:21:21,618
Scott: And if you see like the red dot that says update now, like don't put it off.

360
00:21:21,678 --> 00:21:26,006
Scott: Like I you know, it's like a lot of times the iPhone would be like, I'll update tonight when you're sleeping.

361
00:21:26,026 --> 00:21:26,747
Scott: Don't worry about it.

362
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:28,410
Scott: And I'm like, no, you will update to now.

363
00:21:29,993 --> 00:21:31,360
Scott: Bring me to Java now.

364
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,949
Scott: We're not going to spend all day.

365
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,773
Rym: But I guess you got it.

366
00:21:38,033 --> 00:21:51,270
Rym: This is going to get way worse in a hurry, especially because there are some firms now looking into such things as using large language models to auto generate specifically targeted malware.

367
00:21:53,611 --> 00:21:55,939
Rym: So some other news, I guess this is yours.

368
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,090
Rym: Reddit is about to make itself extremely shitty.

369
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,112
Scott: So Reddit had some shittiness.

370
00:22:01,393 --> 00:22:02,835
Scott: They went through a dark period.

371
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:03,476
Scott: Right.

372
00:22:03,536 --> 00:22:08,463
Scott: They're still in that dark period, but they've managed to hold on basically after.

373
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:12,789
Scott: it's like they took some damage that they haven't repaired, but they're still flying.

374
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,310
Scott: Right.

375
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:17,000
Scott: It's like it's like a ship with a hole that got torpedoed, but it's still sailing.

376
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,166
Scott: It's going to make it home unless it takes more damage.

377
00:22:19,206 --> 00:22:19,507
Scott: All right.

378
00:22:19,527 --> 00:22:20,590
Scott: That's the state of Reddit.

379
00:22:21,231 --> 00:22:31,569
Scott: And Reddit is doing something that is basically if you look at the whole picture, it's basically a plus one minus probably more than one.

380
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:32,090
Scott: Right.

381
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:37,678
Scott: So they had a system previously where you could buy Reddit gold.

382
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:38,319
Scott: Right.

383
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:45,070
Scott: And which is basically turn real money into Reddit currency and you could use the Reddit currency to like award people.

384
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,454
Scott: And I've received awards and it's like whatever.

385
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:47,774
Scott: Right.

386
00:22:47,794 --> 00:22:47,994
Scott: Yeah.

387
00:22:48,135 --> 00:22:58,210
Scott: But basically if you write a post or a comment that is so good that other users who have paid money are like inspired by it, then they like award you.

388
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:02,777
Scott: They're like, Oh my God, I not only I upvote this, but like I need to upvote this extra hard.

389
00:23:03,137 --> 00:23:11,890
Scott: I'm going to give you like, you know, awards and you'll see comments that have like a shit ton of votes, but also have lots of little emojis of various characters next to them.

390
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,433
Scott: That's like this comment is so great.

391
00:23:14,473 --> 00:23:18,880
Scott: This post is so great that everyone is just like throwing money at it because it was so good.

392
00:23:19,961 --> 00:23:26,430
Scott: And the most that person writing that content would ever get would be like, you know, free Reddit premium for a time period.

393
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,834
Rym: Like BoardGameGeek has a similar thing with their coins.

394
00:23:28,894 --> 00:23:29,335
Rym: And you know what?

395
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:34,346
Rym: I realized that my account, which is also the Geek Dance account, has a lot of them from the year.

396
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:36,410
Rym: I never even knew it was a thing until recently.

397
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:36,670
Scott: Yeah.

398
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,193
Scott: You get free ones on BoardGameGeek.

399
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:38,413
Scott: Right.

400
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:41,437
Scott: So that system is sort of good, sort of bad.

401
00:23:41,477 --> 00:23:41,698
Scott: Right.

402
00:23:41,778 --> 00:23:49,910
Scott: The system is good because it sort of tries to give people some incentive who if people care about those things to write good content that everyone will love.

403
00:23:51,331 --> 00:23:54,696
Scott: And it does provide some non advertising funding, of course.

404
00:23:55,177 --> 00:23:55,417
Scott: Right.

405
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:56,899
Scott: The money goes to Reddit.

406
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:57,981
Scott: Right.

407
00:23:58,141 --> 00:23:58,882
Scott: So what they're they?

408
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:03,930
Scott: they threw out that system and they got the now they didn't say what they were replacing it with until today.

409
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:11,919
Scott: What they're replacing it with is a simpler system where basically you pay some amount of money to get like these like big upvotes.

410
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:12,460
Scott: Right.

411
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:14,543
Scott: So it's like you can regular upvote.

412
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:15,444
Scott: Everything is normal.

413
00:24:15,484 --> 00:24:20,409
Scott: But when there's something real good, you basically can spend money to upvote it harder.

414
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:20,830
Scott: Right.

415
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:26,317
Scott: It doesn't appear that that actually affects the ranking of the content.

416
00:24:27,478 --> 00:24:36,789
Scott: I haven't seen any notes about that, but it does award the person who posted the content with real money, effectively speaking.

417
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:37,430
Scott: Right.

418
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,792
Scott: It's like your.

419
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:44,720
Scott: when you see content on Reddit that is so good, you you're willing to throw real dollars at it.

420
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,064
Scott: It enters this system where Reddit takes a cut.

421
00:24:48,224 --> 00:24:52,630
Scott: But it seems like most of the money does end up with the person who made the content.

422
00:24:52,710 --> 00:25:00,637
Rym: Now, this is good because I'd say ish in that YouTube doing that is a problem.

423
00:25:01,577 --> 00:25:01,758
Scott: Right.

424
00:25:01,778 --> 00:25:10,385
Scott: Well, the good part of it is that Reddit is recognizing like, hey, the value of our platform is people, the content that people are making.

425
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:16,610
Scott: And they're not those people making that content, doing moderation, you know, writing posts are not getting anything back.

426
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:16,810
Scott: Right.

427
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,911
Scott: We're basically just looting them.

428
00:25:18,973 --> 00:25:20,074
Scott: So we'll give back to them.

429
00:25:20,214 --> 00:25:20,374
Scott: Right.

430
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:21,716
Scott: And that seems like justice.

431
00:25:21,856 --> 00:25:22,036
Scott: Right.

432
00:25:22,056 --> 00:25:25,560
Scott: Like, oh, I wrote a great post on Reddit and Reddit gets all the benefits.

433
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,182
Scott: They run all the ads and keep all the money.

434
00:25:27,242 --> 00:25:32,988
Scott: It's like, no, if you wrote something so good that people are throwing money at it, you'll get that money.

435
00:25:33,168 --> 00:25:33,609
Scott: Some of it.

436
00:25:33,689 --> 00:25:33,869
Scott: Right.

437
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:34,530
Scott: A lot of it.

438
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,052
Scott: It seems more just.

439
00:25:37,072 --> 00:25:48,541
Scott: the problem is the negative here is that you're now going to have people who have realized, wait, I can make I can make money posting on Reddit.

440
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:49,582
Scott: That could be a job.

441
00:25:49,762 --> 00:25:49,962
Scott: Right.

442
00:25:50,022 --> 00:25:59,690
Scott: As soon as you enter money in the equation, real money, people now are basically just like on YouTube, just like on Twitch, just like on every other platform where you can make money.

443
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:00,531
Scott: Right.

444
00:26:00,931 --> 00:26:19,345
Scott: Are going to now start up whole industries, basically, of being a leech and snagging on to Reddit and trying to on purpose spend all fucking day creating content that you hope will get mega upvoted and so that you can basically make a career.

445
00:26:19,365 --> 00:26:20,385
Scott: Right.

446
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:26,350
Scott: Of just posting stuff and getting people to send you money because the stuff you post is so good.

447
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:32,194
Scott: Now, all the upvotes have to come from people who real people who spent money.

448
00:26:32,514 --> 00:26:43,742
Scott: So I guess if the content you make is succeeding in this plan that you're adding real value, you're making real posts and comments that people like.

449
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:44,163
Scott: Maybe.

450
00:26:44,343 --> 00:26:54,650
Rym: But at the counterpoint, are you catering to the whims of the kind of person who would spend money to upload something on a site like Reddit?

451
00:26:55,471 --> 00:26:56,812
Scott: Yep.

452
00:26:57,372 --> 00:26:58,533
Rym: I think that's right.

453
00:26:58,633 --> 00:26:59,694
Scott: Are you posting content?

454
00:26:59,714 --> 00:27:02,636
Scott: You're not posting this content in good faith.

455
00:27:02,676 --> 00:27:08,561
Scott: You're not making the content because it's something you have interest in or knowledge about or are good at writing.

456
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:12,304
Scott: It's you are good at making a content that makes money.

457
00:27:12,905 --> 00:27:19,390
Scott: And this will cause the kind of content that is posted on Reddit to shift dramatically the user base.

458
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:19,750
Scott: Right.

459
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:34,121
Scott: Well, now you'll have an influx of people who come to read it, not because they want to be there, because they want to make money, just like how Magic the Gathering has a lot of people in their community who are not there because they want to play a good card game, but because they want to buy and sell cards and make money.

460
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:42,166
Scott: And the worst part is they're going to flood every Reddit community with attempts to make any Reddit community with a significant number of users in it.

461
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:47,330
Rym: I think with large language models, things are going to flood every Reddit community very quickly.

462
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:50,472
Scott: Well, Reddit also has a lot of restrictions on automated posting.

463
00:27:50,492 --> 00:27:54,915
Scott: It makes it even difficult for us to automatically post new episodes to our own subreddit.

464
00:27:54,975 --> 00:27:58,477
Scott: But yeah, it's going to be a thing.

465
00:27:58,497 --> 00:28:00,979
Scott: And I don't think...

466
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:25,597
Rym: And we specifically talked about how rewarding people for post volume is always a bad idea.

467
00:28:26,118 --> 00:28:29,041
Scott: And this doesn't reward for post volume.

468
00:28:29,181 --> 00:28:36,850
Rym: Arguably, it will indirectly in that more volume just because I mean spam, like some percentage of people click on spam volume.

469
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:41,378
Scott: I mean, even with the old system, though, it was like the only things that got.

470
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:48,470
Scott: all those awards were extremely hot posts and comments.

471
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:48,850
Scott: Right.

472
00:28:49,551 --> 00:29:01,604
Rym: But two, I think back to when we used to use Slashdot before it got really shitty back in the late 90s through early to mid 2000s, then Slashdot became shitty.

473
00:29:02,145 --> 00:29:04,708
Rym: But during that era, it's kind of had a game.

474
00:29:04,908 --> 00:29:06,690
Rym: And I kept this game up for a long time.

475
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:18,784
Rym: My goal was, and I succeeded for years, was to only ever post to Slashdot if I was sure I would get a plus five, meaning the moderators all voted me up to.

476
00:29:19,085 --> 00:29:19,745
Rym: There's a whole system.

477
00:29:19,785 --> 00:29:23,590
Rym: I don't explain about how it worked, but plus five meant it was like the maximum rating.

478
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:27,609
Scott: It couldn't be higher than plus five in the way Slashdot used to work in the early 2000s.

479
00:29:28,251 --> 00:29:28,491
Rym: Yep.

480
00:29:28,632 --> 00:29:31,779
Rym: So you're supposed to be anywhere between plus five and basically minus one.

481
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,910
Rym: So plus five was like you made an amazing post that is important to Slashdot.

482
00:29:37,655 --> 00:29:38,669
Scott: And everyone agrees with this.

483
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,734
Rym: But the Slashdot community was the way it was.

484
00:29:41,754 --> 00:29:45,579
Rym: It was very clear the kinds of posts that could get plus fives.

485
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:53,190
Rym: And I basically decided to only ever post if I knew I'd get a plus five and I would lose if I ever broke my streak.

486
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,273
Rym: And I had a multi year streak of always getting a plus fives.

487
00:29:55,734 --> 00:29:58,998
Rym: But the posts I posted were shitty bullshit.

488
00:29:59,379 --> 00:30:07,110
Rym: I was writing what I knew the people who are moderating Slashdot would vote up and I was not writing things that I necessarily strongly believed in.

489
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:11,117
Rym: I wasn't writing the kind of content I would write if I wasn't going for that plus five.

490
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:17,870
Rym: My own behavior was drastically modified by this goal of getting other people to click a plus button next to my post.

491
00:30:18,751 --> 00:30:18,971
Scott: Yep.

492
00:30:19,011 --> 00:30:24,999
Scott: So every person out there who is writing content with the thought in their mind of let me try to.

493
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,141
Scott: I want to make money.

494
00:30:26,221 --> 00:30:32,810
Scott: I need to write what will get an award is going to basically bring the quality of overall Reddit.

495
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,643
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

496
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:47,329
Rym: So I've been watching a lot of physics videos and I know I use them as thing of the day and I talk about it a lot.

497
00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:54,996
Rym: But I hit a point to where I was lacking some basic foundational maths in that there's all.

498
00:30:55,076 --> 00:30:57,778
Rym: I understand a lot of concepts of calculus, but I'm not good at calculus.

499
00:30:57,798 --> 00:30:59,480
Rym: Like I need someone else to like actually do it.

500
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:05,706
Rym: But when it comes to imaginary numbers in particular, I realized I didn't.

501
00:31:05,786 --> 00:31:10,131
Rym: I didn't have like a fluent understanding of what the fuck they are.

502
00:31:10,251 --> 00:31:11,772
Rym: Like I knew how to use them in math.

503
00:31:11,832 --> 00:31:14,575
Rym: It was like the opposite problem, but I didn't know what the fuck they were.

504
00:31:15,236 --> 00:31:19,460
Rym: And they kept coming up in all the physics videos I was watching.

505
00:31:20,081 --> 00:31:28,192
Scott: So it's like I had the same problem where, like, I know that my imaginary number knowledge was more than zero, but it was very, very weak.

506
00:31:28,592 --> 00:31:34,520
Rym: Multiply a number by the square root of negative one and bam, now you got imaginary numbers and you can have an imaginary number.

507
00:31:35,241 --> 00:31:35,701
Scott: Exactly.

508
00:31:35,762 --> 00:31:38,605
Scott: So it's like I knew that much and that's about all I knew.

509
00:31:39,026 --> 00:31:42,751
Scott: And, you know, it always been in my mind like, hmm, should I figure that out?

510
00:31:42,971 --> 00:31:44,653
Scott: I should go read about it, learn about it.

511
00:31:44,693 --> 00:31:46,816
Scott: But also I don't need that in my everyday life.

512
00:31:46,876 --> 00:31:48,218
Scott: So why should I go and bother?

513
00:31:48,598 --> 00:31:49,980
Scott: And, you know, so I just never did.

514
00:31:51,623 --> 00:32:01,679
Rym: And the kinds of physics you do in high school, even if you take the AP Physics C with like the crazy calculus stuff, you won't actually need to understand this to do that math.

515
00:32:01,739 --> 00:32:02,220
Rym: So it was fine.

516
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,900
Scott: I think there was maybe one class at RIT where they taught it and I didn't help.

517
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:16,253
Rym: So this video is five minutes and 46 seconds long and it, like, unlocked something in my fucking brain.

518
00:32:16,413 --> 00:32:20,759
Rym: And I'm not saying I'm not an expert at imaginary numbers, but now I understand what they are.

519
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:30,080
Scott: Yeah, like I just the what the five minute video I was like, Jesus, fuck every I'm like, I'm hating every single other math person on Team Gauss.

520
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:30,601
Rym: Yeah.

521
00:32:30,781 --> 00:32:37,819
Rym: So the bit the underlying story here is that Carl Friedrich Gauss, you know, the guy that Gauss is named after, magnet man.

522
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:38,160
Rym: Yeah.

523
00:32:39,381 --> 00:32:41,669
Rym: Fun fact, you know, you know what country he was born in?

524
00:32:43,215 --> 00:32:44,700
Rym: The Holy Roman Empire.

525
00:32:45,482 --> 00:32:52,240
Scott: OK, so I was going to guess Germany, I guess, but that would not been entirely wrong.

526
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,523
Rym: Oh, would have been close enough.

527
00:32:54,045 --> 00:32:58,000
Rym: So Gauss was mad about this back then.

528
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:07,240
Rym: And he made a strong argument that everyone else in the math world gave imaginary numbers a stupid name and it was confusing and we shouldn't have called them that.

529
00:33:07,742 --> 00:33:08,485
Rym: And he was right.

530
00:33:08,866 --> 00:33:09,931
Rym: Everyone else was wrong.

531
00:33:10,353 --> 00:33:12,160
Rym: I am as mad now as he was then.

532
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,023
Rym: And there's a quote I got to read because it's so good.

533
00:33:14,303 --> 00:33:24,320
Rym: This is what Gauss said that this subject has hitherto been surrounded by mysterious obscurity is to be attributed largely to an ill adapted notation.

534
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:38,420
Rym: If, for example, plus one, minus one and the square root of minus one had been called direct, inverse and lateral instead of positive, negative and imaginary, such an obscurity would have been out of the question.

535
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,483
Rym: And he is fucking right.

536
00:33:39,763 --> 00:33:42,951
Rym: Imaginary numbers are just another dimension on the number line.

537
00:33:42,971 --> 00:33:43,292
Rym: That's it.

538
00:33:43,332 --> 00:33:43,994
Rym: That's all they are.

539
00:33:44,354 --> 00:33:44,715
Scott: Bam.

540
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:44,996
Scott: Yep.

541
00:33:45,176 --> 00:33:45,497
Scott: Done.

542
00:33:45,758 --> 00:33:46,540
Scott: That's it.

543
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:56,300
Rym: And it turns out multidimensional math is extremely useful because the other the buried lead, if you watch a few more of these, we live in a place with at least three dimensions.

544
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:56,881
Scott: Right.

545
00:33:57,522 --> 00:34:06,100
Rym: But maybe the number line that you learn in school is also kind of fake in that it really implies that every number is on the number line.

546
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,906
Rym: And there's an infinite number of numbers on the number line.

547
00:34:08,187 --> 00:34:09,851
Rym: And that is absolutely not true.

548
00:34:09,911 --> 00:34:12,500
Rym: And even how we do negatives is entirely arbitrary.

549
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:21,510
Rym: So the best part of the video, though, is when they do a little thing and they show you what the square root of negative one like.

550
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:28,760
Rym: solving an equation like that actually looks like using imaginary numbers for real with a three dimensional visualization.

551
00:34:29,281 --> 00:34:30,884
Rym: That'll just hit your brain right in the.

552
00:34:30,964 --> 00:34:32,027
Rym: oh, shit, I get it now.

553
00:34:32,206 --> 00:34:33,510
Rym: Like right in that spot.

554
00:34:34,712 --> 00:34:36,175
Scott: Well, sorry.

555
00:34:36,255 --> 00:34:37,958
Scott: I showed this to me 20 years ago.

556
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:38,940
Rym: Yep.

557
00:34:39,261 --> 00:34:44,014
Rym: Every high school math teacher should show their kids this video or at least explain it this way.

558
00:34:44,737 --> 00:34:45,699
Scott: If you got the smart kids.

559
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,911
Scott: Yeah, I don't think the not smart, you know, if it's not the honors class, I don't think anyone will care.

560
00:34:49,951 --> 00:34:53,080
Rym: I mean, the non honors class has never got to imaginary numbers or any of that.

561
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:58,850
Scott: But if you show it to the honors class, maybe you'll find the one like the few kids who actually do care.

562
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:05,120
Scott: And they're like, you know, even though they're not currently performing at honors level, you can see that they have the curiosity and the interest.

563
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,007
Rym: And then the best part is the example they use to explain it.

564
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:15,620
Rym: Instead of using the square root of negative one, they use where does the equation X squared plus one reach zero?

565
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,564
Rym: And the answer is somewhere off the number line.

566
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:19,526
Scott: Yep.

567
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:21,930
Rym: So anyway, what do you got?

568
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,053
Rym: Granted, I know what you got and it's fucking amazing.

569
00:35:24,674 --> 00:35:25,054
Scott: Yeah.

570
00:35:25,114 --> 00:35:28,800
Scott: So, uh, you know, summer's over, right?

571
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:42,560
Scott: And the only thing to get us through this dark, dark winter times besides Halloween, December holidays, skiing is if you're not, if you're a new GeekNights listener, if you're an old GeekNights, listen, you won't be surprised.

572
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,461
Scott: The answer is ice hockey.

573
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:50,069
Scott: Uh, so, uh, ice hockey is currently beginning in the national hockey league.

574
00:35:50,089 --> 00:35:52,251
Scott: The preseason games have begun.

575
00:35:52,311 --> 00:35:59,940
Scott: No one cares about those except this one preseason game that was held in Australia.

576
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,923
Scott: We know we've been there.

577
00:36:02,023 --> 00:36:05,749
Scott: People in Australia love sports and ice hockey.

578
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:10,217
Rym: Last time we were in Melbourne together, we went to a footy game cause we like sports.

579
00:36:10,237 --> 00:36:12,240
Scott: I wanted to go to a cricket game, but like we couldn't do both.

580
00:36:13,461 --> 00:36:14,843
Scott: And then that soccer game invaded.

581
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:20,731
Scott: Uh, but ice hockey is not a sport they have really.

582
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:23,154
Scott: They have it, but it's very low level in Australia.

583
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:24,657
Scott: It's really weak, right?

584
00:36:24,797 --> 00:36:26,980
Scott: They've got a few ranks here and there, right?

585
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:34,154
Scott: It's not, it's, you know, but there are people in Australia, thanks to the internet who can follow ice hockey and are in love with it.

586
00:36:35,035 --> 00:36:37,340
Scott: And the NHL said, all right, we hear you.

587
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:52,320
Scott: We're going to bring a preseason game between the Los Angeles Kings and the Arizona coyotes to Melbourne and play in Rod Laver arena where the Australian open plays tennis and many other sports also happen, but mostly tennis.

588
00:36:53,221 --> 00:36:54,883
Scott: And we're going to put an ice hockey right there.

589
00:36:54,943 --> 00:36:58,006
Scott: You can watch a preseason ice hockey in person, all you Australians.

590
00:36:59,127 --> 00:37:00,569
Scott: Uh, that's awesome that they did that.

591
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:10,400
Scott: And sure enough, uh, the hot new rookie for the Arizona coyotes, uh, Logan Cooley, right?

592
00:37:11,322 --> 00:37:13,405
Scott: Uh, very recent high draft pick for them.

593
00:37:14,287 --> 00:37:21,360
Scott: He comes in and he scores was probably the greatest ice hockey goal scored ever in Australia.

594
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:26,227
Scott: Definitely in Australia, but it's definitely the best goal ever scored in Australia.

595
00:37:26,968 --> 00:37:27,248
Scott: Right?

596
00:37:27,508 --> 00:37:35,580
Scott: So the Australian, the people of Melbourne and other parts of below the equator got their money's worth.

597
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:40,907
Scott: You have now seen the ice hockey, uh, and you can be jealous that we have plenty of this and you have, you have won.

598
00:37:41,048 --> 00:37:41,749
Scott: Yeah.

599
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:44,833
Rym: Americans, you think Americans are obsessed with their football?

600
00:37:44,873 --> 00:37:51,801
Scott: Nah, our sport, it's kind of rude to give someone like one taste and be like, that's it.

601
00:37:51,901 --> 00:37:53,444
Rym: Australians think they're all hardcore.

602
00:37:53,524 --> 00:38:02,100
Rym: And our sport is, yeah, we put blades on our feet and run around on ice, hitting a piece of rubber with footy is more hardcore than hockey.

603
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:10,688
Rym: Footy, I feel like is effectively less hardcore in that there aren't blades everywhere.

604
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:21,380
Rym: Let me tell you, if I was forced to play footy or ice hockey, I would, well, uh, depends if I'm playing where the people who play these sports might hurt me.

605
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,642
Scott: Actually, no, you know what?

606
00:38:22,682 --> 00:38:24,145
Scott: No, I think I'm going to change my mind.

607
00:38:24,165 --> 00:38:27,310
Scott: I was going to say I'd play for the sake of my own safety.

608
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:32,860
Scott: I would choose ice hockey, but no, because if I played ice hockey, even with my bad skating, I would fall and hurt myself.

609
00:38:33,241 --> 00:38:36,907
Scott: If I play footy, I can just run away and hide in the corner and not involve myself.

610
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:43,840
Rym: I feel like footy players, if you and I were forced to be on two teams in a match, they would just not kill us.

611
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:49,452
Rym: I feel like an NHL hockey man would check us like anybody else and they'd shoot the puck and it would hit us.

612
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:50,234
Rym: We would just die.

613
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,760
Rym: We would just die instantly being punched by Mike Tyson.

614
00:38:53,001 --> 00:38:55,207
Scott: I'm saying, no, I would just, I would hurt myself on skates.

615
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:56,671
Scott: Footy, you're on feet.

616
00:38:56,812 --> 00:38:58,196
Scott: I could just run away and hide.

617
00:38:58,216 --> 00:38:59,640
Rym: I don't have to involve myself.

618
00:39:01,201 --> 00:39:04,145
Rym: In the meta moment, the GeekNights Book Club book, The Murderbot Diaries.

619
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:07,069
Rym: I am a third of the way through the fifth one, the long one.

620
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:10,734
Rym: Murderbot Diaries continue to be pretty fun.

621
00:39:11,014 --> 00:39:14,940
Rym: Big alien, aliens, world type vibes.

622
00:39:16,601 --> 00:39:25,380
Scott: I have read every Murderbot diary and we will do an episode on it in November after yet another Murderbot diary is scheduled to be released.

623
00:39:26,941 --> 00:39:28,265
Scott: We will then read it.

624
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:30,933
Scott: It shouldn't take me more than a day, I'm going to guess.

625
00:39:31,655 --> 00:39:33,300
Scott: And then we could do an episode on it.

626
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:46,020
Rym: I will say, having read now over four of these books, like getting into the long one, I would enjoy being Murderbot's friend, but it would be the kind of friend I want to meet occasionally, but not live with or spend too much time with.

627
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,486
Scott: Murderbot's okay.

628
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:51,500
Rym: Murderbot's trying hard to be a little Murderbot.

629
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,708
Scott: I mean, it's a book, you know, it's fiction.

630
00:39:53,748 --> 00:39:56,700
Scott: You hopefully would make the main character like Murderbot.

631
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:01,840
Rym: Murderbot is really likable and you just want them to be okay and to be able to watch their shows.

632
00:40:03,681 --> 00:40:11,160
Scott: In other book club news, The Iliad by Emily Wilson.

633
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,684
Rym: I'm so excited about that.

634
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:17,700
Rym: We might have to pause the regularly scheduled selections of book clubs to just do a book club on that.

635
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:23,949
Scott: Murderbot is set to be released tomorrow, September 26th, 2023.

636
00:40:23,949 --> 00:40:25,712
Scott: It is 846 pages long.

637
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:35,169
Rym: Now somehow I feel like I liked reading The Tale of Genji, but we took a while.

638
00:40:35,189 --> 00:40:38,697
Rym: I feel like I'm going to read that the same way.

639
00:40:38,757 --> 00:40:40,160
Rym: I read one of those Prince of Nothing books.

640
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,520
Rym: Like it comes out and I just read the whole thing and then like it's done somehow.

641
00:40:44,261 --> 00:40:53,977
Scott: There's going to be an audio book too, but I have a feeling though that, you know, reading about Lega Lamnad and such will be more fun and keep the pace going.

642
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:02,000
Rym: Because Genji's kind of a shit and while the Greeks and the Trojans are also shits, they're exciting shits.

643
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,685
Scott: Yeah, so there you go.

644
00:41:07,068 --> 00:41:07,870
Scott: That's going to be a thing.

645
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:12,018
Scott: It costs 20 bucks on Kindle and 36 bucks hardcover.

646
00:41:12,078 --> 00:41:12,780
Scott: No paperback yet.

647
00:41:13,741 --> 00:41:20,100
Scott: I recommend library where I'm going right now to search and see if I can get on like a waiting list.

648
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:25,140
Rym: Emily Wilson books seem like the kind of books I want to own a physical copy of because these are things I would reread.

649
00:41:28,226 --> 00:41:28,800
Scott: Hardcover though?

650
00:41:29,981 --> 00:41:31,225
Rym: Yeah, probably not.

651
00:41:31,325 --> 00:41:31,726
Rym: I don't know.

652
00:41:32,669 --> 00:41:35,940
Rym: Hard to say because that's the Odyssey, like her Odyssey translation.

653
00:41:36,941 --> 00:41:37,824
Rym: We talked about it on GeekNights.

654
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:43,880
Rym: I expected it to change how I felt about the Odyssey, but it changed it more than I expected.

655
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,685
Rym: Another personal minor thing.

656
00:41:47,745 --> 00:41:52,178
Rym: So I am running in the New York City Marathon on November 5th.

657
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,118
Scott: So I guess that's actually happening.

658
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,183
Rym: Yep, I'm on the team.

659
00:41:55,484 --> 00:41:56,589
Rym: I'm running in it.

660
00:41:56,789 --> 00:41:59,580
Rym: I'm shooting for a four hour time, which I think is very achievable.

661
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,651
Scott: The library does have a listing for it.

662
00:42:03,671 --> 00:42:05,440
Scott: Let's see how many people are in the queue.

663
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:12,257
Rym: But I do expect on the day of the marathon, I'm going to temporarily set my Google Maps.

664
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:13,958
Scott: All copies out on loan.

665
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:14,742
Rym: Yeah, of course.

666
00:42:15,384 --> 00:42:18,920
Rym: To post my location at any time in case anyone in New York wants to see me.

667
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:25,277
Rym: The best part about the New York City Marathon is that the route literally goes past our apartment.

668
00:42:25,858 --> 00:42:26,540
Rym: Like right there.

669
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:30,540
Scott: I know the route extremely well because I have bicycled it several times.

670
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,562
Rym: I bicycled it with you once.

671
00:42:31,622 --> 00:42:32,204
Rym: It was pretty fun.

672
00:42:32,224 --> 00:42:35,012
Rym: I can't this time because I got to get up at like 4 fucking a.m.

673
00:42:35,413 --> 00:42:37,198
Rym: to get on a bus to Staten Island at like 5 a.m.

674
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:40,439
Rym: Because based on my race history...

675
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,215
Scott: Wouldn't you take the train to the ferry?

676
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:45,184
Rym: Nope, nope.

677
00:42:45,204 --> 00:42:49,440
Rym: I learned some things about the New York City Marathon that I should probably save for a separate opening bit.

678
00:42:49,821 --> 00:42:57,320
Rym: But let's just say they send you an email if you're actually in it because it's hard to get into and it's basically to summarize.

679
00:42:58,141 --> 00:42:59,285
Rym: You can't get here.

680
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:02,837
Rym: All the ways you think you're going to get to the start are not going to work.

681
00:43:03,218 --> 00:43:03,660
Rym: Fuck you.

682
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:05,346
Rym: Read this email.

683
00:43:05,628 --> 00:43:07,959
Rym: You've got to follow these instructions or you will...

684
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:08,840
Scott: The ferry isn't going to work?

685
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,225
Rym: Good luck getting on our ferry.

686
00:43:11,245 --> 00:43:16,580
Rym: that will get you there at the right time to be in your pen and to do all the stuff you got to do.

687
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,838
Scott: How about just a fucking taxi?

688
00:43:19,262 --> 00:43:19,988
Scott: No, taxis.

689
00:43:20,008 --> 00:43:20,694
Rym: They block the roads.

690
00:43:20,714 --> 00:43:21,258
Rym: You can't get there.

691
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:22,360
Scott: Okay.

692
00:43:22,721 --> 00:43:26,500
Rym: In fact, some of the roads are blocked because of that bike thing you do and other reasons.

693
00:43:27,701 --> 00:43:28,995
Rym: So basically, I got to get on this...

694
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,032
Scott: They don't block any special roads for biking.

695
00:43:32,113 --> 00:43:35,692
Scott: It's just literally... They're blocking the roads for the marathon and bike.

696
00:43:35,752 --> 00:43:37,059
Scott: people are like, "Ooh, the roads are blocked.

697
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:37,180
Scott: Let's

698
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:37,240
Scott: go.".

699
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,619
Rym: But they block it very early and they basically said...

700
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,499
Scott: They do block them very early.

701
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:47,040
Rym: You will not be able to get to Staten Island, let alone get anywhere near the starting area unless you do what we say and they are not kidding.

702
00:43:47,242 --> 00:43:49,600
Scott: What if you just went to Staten Island the day before and slept there?

703
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,443
Rym: I mean, where?

704
00:43:50,543 --> 00:43:51,126
Rym: In a hotel?

705
00:43:51,186 --> 00:43:53,900
Rym: They're probably already all sold out like a year in advance.

706
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,319
Scott: But you could have been one of those people.

707
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,287
Rym: I ain't doing that.

708
00:43:57,308 --> 00:43:57,999
Rym: I'm sleeping in my house.

709
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:05,480
Rym: But I have to get on a special bus to be there early, partly because of the time I'm shooting for and my race history.

710
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,708
Rym: They put me... Not in the real racers.

711
00:44:08,652 --> 00:44:10,300
Rym: A real racer will do this marathon.

712
00:44:11,801 --> 00:44:14,740
Scott: Someone just broke another marathon record in Berlin again.

713
00:44:15,122 --> 00:44:16,994
Rym: She crushed the women's record.

714
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:17,860
Rym: Like, crushing it.

715
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:21,980
Scott: Berlin seems to be the place that has the perfect weather, the perfect conditions, the perfect route.

716
00:44:22,441 --> 00:44:25,100
Scott: It's like, if you want to win the marathon, that's the place to go.

717
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,534
Rym: But someone who's a contender will run a marathon in like two-ish hours.

718
00:44:28,694 --> 00:44:30,000
Rym: I'm shooting for four hours.

719
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:38,860
Rym: And that is considered a very good time for a normal person who is a serious, serious athlete but not a professional athlete running marathons.

720
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:40,707
Scott: Let's take a poll.

721
00:44:40,927 --> 00:44:44,480
Scott: If you want to start a little betting league, how many bargals?

722
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,732
Scott: Well, we can bet on... We gotta do a two-dimensional one.

723
00:44:48,154 --> 00:44:49,160
Scott: Finish didn't finish.

724
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:50,600
Scott: Bargle didn't bargle.

725
00:44:51,602 --> 00:44:52,625
Rym: So, a point of data.

726
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:57,800
Rym: I've only ever bargled in 5Ks because I tend to boggle in hard sprint runs.

727
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,765
Rym: But long distance running, I do all the time.

728
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:07,740
Rym: I can run a half marathon in under two hours with no food, no water, no stops, without even feeling tired at the end of it.

729
00:45:08,406 --> 00:45:09,459
Rym: I can run a half marathon...

730
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:10,540
Scott: There's gonna be a lot of free water.

731
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:10,901
Rym: Yup.

732
00:45:10,981 --> 00:45:12,567
Rym: I can run a half marathon in an hour.

733
00:45:13,009 --> 00:45:15,840
Rym: forty-one-ish is the best time I ever got.

734
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:16,980
Scott: Is it cheating if you get Red Bull?

735
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,428
Rym: Uh, no.

736
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:19,820
Rym: I can do whatever, pretty much.

737
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,100
Scott: Should I stand on the side of the road with my bike and give you a Red Bull?

738
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:27,858
Rym: If you handed me a Red Bull, somehow on this race, I would absolutely take it and pound it.

739
00:45:31,001 --> 00:45:32,547
Scott: Maybe I'll find wherever I can go.

740
00:45:32,587 --> 00:45:36,220
Scott: I can bike to, like, you know, I know some spots that'll be, like, quieter.

741
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:40,320
Rym: You can pull a Cramer and there's not actually a Red Bull in the Red Bull.

742
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:49,420
Scott: You know, I could actually probably, like, go to a spot, right, you pass me, and then I could go to a different spot and you would pass me again.

743
00:45:51,841 --> 00:45:52,585
Rym: So this should be fun.

744
00:45:52,646 --> 00:45:55,280
Rym: Last meta bit, then we'll get into the main bit about search engines.

745
00:45:55,641 --> 00:46:04,100
Rym: The announced here first, GeekNights has not one, but two events in the schedule at PAX Unplugged, which is coming up sooner than you expect.

746
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,340
Scott: We're allowed to announce this even though the schedule's not out?

747
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:19,274
Rym: Yes, so the GeekNights, so if you've ever interacted with Penny Arcade and PAX on the back end, they send you an email when they schedule you that basically says, "Please promote this as much as you want, like, go fucking nuts.

748
00:46:19,314 --> 00:46:20,538
Rym: Don't worry for the schedule to come

749
00:46:20,658 --> 00:46:20,739
Rym: out.".

750
00:46:21,241 --> 00:46:24,876
Rym: So we're gonna do a panel on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.

751
00:46:24,896 --> 00:46:25,740
Rym: in the Crab God Theater.

752
00:46:26,961 --> 00:46:27,423
Rym: Way back.

753
00:46:27,463 --> 00:46:31,460
Rym: we did that talk, Mastering Game Mechanics, one of our more popular talks, really good talk.

754
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:35,340
Rym: I, like, Scott wrote that one, I wrote Practical Game Theory, we did them back to back.

755
00:46:35,601 --> 00:46:39,220
Rym: They're both, like, crazy popular in terms of GeekNights talks.

756
00:46:39,961 --> 00:46:51,360
Rym: So we decided to expand on that panel and do a panel about every game mechanic one by one over time that we feel like we have some expertise in.

757
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:56,580
Rym: And we're starting with the one that was the easiest, lowest hanging fruit, because I think we have the most to say.

758
00:46:57,401 --> 00:46:59,890
Rym: And we've played the most games, Worker Placement.

759
00:47:01,576 --> 00:47:02,499
Rym: Excited about this one.

760
00:47:03,581 --> 00:47:10,160
Scott: The GeekNights website, the new one is very close to releasability, it's basically releasable right now, kind of.

761
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:17,840
Scott: We need to actually set a time to release it, maybe October 7th or 8th, 'cause I got nothing doing.

762
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,960
Rym: Yup, we gotta sit down and there's some tasks we gotta accomplish.

763
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,084
Scott: We just need to deploy it.

764
00:47:23,285 --> 00:47:28,859
Scott: Once it's deployed, it will be open source and you could contribute to it if you want to, I guess, you know.

765
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:53,420
Scott: Also, MagFest, I don't know what's gonna be at MagFest quite yet, but I do know this, is that if you bought tickets to MagFest, which you can still do, the hotel lottery, because there are not enough hotel rooms to go around, is going to be on Wednesday, September 27th, two days from this recording, so maybe one day from when you're listening to it.

766
00:47:53,801 --> 00:48:03,660
Scott: You would've gotten emails about this if you bought tickets, but if you didn't buy tickets to MagFest and you're thinking about going, buy the tickets now, otherwise you're gonna miss the hotel lottery in two days.

767
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:14,620
Rym: And if you miss the hotel lottery for MagFest and you don't have a special way to get a room, which, you know, I've never bought a MagFest badge, we don't have access to any of this stuff.

768
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:16,544
Rym: We get rooms different ways.

769
00:48:17,246 --> 00:48:21,260
Rym: There's no way to get a hotel anywhere near that con, like good fucking luck.

770
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:35,600
Scott: If you're staying in a hotel that is not in the National Harbor and using some sort of bus or taxi to get back and forth to MagFest, or you will be trying to find a place in MagFest to hide and sleep under a table in the tabletop zone or something.

771
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,579
Rym: Which, odds of success, higher than you'd think.

772
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,320
Scott: It's a 24/7 con still, so they hide inside an arcade cabinet, I don't know.

773
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:51,757
Rym: I have definitely encountered people who were like, under a table in a panel room that wasn't being used, just sleeping.

774
00:48:51,898 --> 00:48:52,960
Rym: Straight up like in a sleeping bag.

775
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,896
Scott: You can't do outside though, because the weather is cold.

776
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:55,901
Rym: Yes.

777
00:48:56,883 --> 00:48:57,584
Rym: I double checked.

778
00:48:58,085 --> 00:49:02,976
Rym: The room that I have booked up is still listed as booked and valid, so we have a room.

779
00:49:03,377 --> 00:49:04,319
Rym: if you are going to MagFest.

780
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:11,540
Scott: There is a very high chance- We're gonna attempt the hotel lottery, because you can always cancel that.

781
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,130
Rym: Yes, you should attempt the hotel lottery.

782
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:20,580
Scott: I'm also going to see if- There also might be a scenario where if I win the hotel lottery, maybe you can cancel that room and come on over.

783
00:49:21,321 --> 00:49:28,260
Rym: Or maybe we'll get a free room from the con because of the major stuff, because we are often- That's never happened before, but that would be awesome.

784
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:35,380
Rym: No, we have been offered them every MagFest, I just don't take it because we always wanted to stay in the nice place across the street instead of staying in the hotel.

785
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:38,580
Scott: Well, the nice place across the street is rumored to have some issues right now.

786
00:49:39,121 --> 00:49:49,440
Rym: That issue seems to be overrated and seems to be related to people who are trying to use rooms that they have through timeshares, but have lower priority than other people who have rooms and timeshares.

787
00:49:50,103 --> 00:49:50,380
Scott: Anyway.

788
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:57,659
Rym: Anyway, we will very likely be at MagFest doing between one and five panels, so stay tuned on that.

789
00:49:58,967 --> 00:49:59,660
Scott: Five is too many.

790
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:05,829
Rym: Well, I do a lot more panels than you at most MagFests, but I don't run those panels.

791
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:13,040
Rym: There's a lot of panels I just join where I'm just one of the talking heads who shows up and all I gotta do is talk based on what someone else is saying.

792
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,280
Rym: That's way easier than doing the kind of talks me and Scott do together.

793
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:18,920
Scott: Alright, so let's go on to the main bit, finally.

794
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,535
Rym: Alright, search engines don't work anymore, like at all.

795
00:50:21,636 --> 00:50:22,400
Rym: This is a problem.

796
00:50:22,741 --> 00:50:27,340
Scott: Yeah, so we could talk, we could spend a whole episode talking about search engines, but I think that will take too long.

797
00:50:27,682 --> 00:50:29,780
Scott: So let's just talk about the recent history, right?

798
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:37,400
Scott: Is that basically all the other search engines other than Google got eliminated because Google was better than they were.

799
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:44,080
Scott: Google is the champion and Google is currently in an antitrust lawsuit and there's going to be other lawsuits about its search dominance.

800
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:48,289
Scott: That lawsuit we'll discuss when it's over, I guess, but there's a lot of issues.

801
00:50:48,369 --> 00:50:53,780
Scott: If you search for it online, you'll see a lot of news stories about the trial being secret and bullshit going on.

802
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,641
Scott: Shady biz.

803
00:50:55,061 --> 00:51:11,260
Scott: Anyway, but the Google itself, the search results using Google to Google things, right, has, and it's, we don't know, I can't, you know, there's no data really, but it's not, it's my perception is agreeing with the complaints from other people.

804
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:20,410
Scott: So I think there is a common growing perception, true or not, that Google is being, is becoming worse at being Google.

805
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:30,460
Scott: When you search for things, you are getting more results of shitty content, farm websites, uh, as you know, garbagey ad laden websites.

806
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:40,837
Rym: If you use the parameters, putting minuses or like saying, I want to search for, I don't know, F 16 minus military, like whatever you're trying to search for.

807
00:51:40,857 --> 00:51:42,960
Rym: I found those just don't fucking work anymore.

808
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:54,460
Scott: And there are various reports of the various search box features like quotes and negative signs not working as well as they used to or not working at all.

809
00:51:55,161 --> 00:51:59,288
Scott: Um, but basically, you know, people are not happy with the Google search results.

810
00:51:59,448 --> 00:52:01,051
Scott: And I noticed this particularly.

811
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,836
Scott: most of my Googling is, is technology related.

812
00:52:03,876 --> 00:52:06,460
Scott: I'm usually searching for software questions for my job.

813
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:15,230
Scott: Um, and it's clear that like, I'll do a search for something, even though I'm not really searching.

814
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:17,413
Scott: I know the website I want to go to.

815
00:52:17,693 --> 00:52:17,933
Scott: Right.

816
00:52:18,154 --> 00:52:22,760
Scott: But the fastest way to get there is to not know the URL because I don't know the URL.

817
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:23,621
Scott: Right.

818
00:52:24,242 --> 00:52:27,966
Scott: And not to go to like python.org and then search there.

819
00:52:28,387 --> 00:52:36,136
Scott: The fastest way is to Google and then click the link, which I am expecting will go to the official python documentation.

820
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:39,320
Scott: because why wouldn't that be the highest ranked thing?

821
00:52:39,661 --> 00:52:39,901
Scott: Right.

822
00:52:40,162 --> 00:52:42,266
Scott: That is clearly or at least stack overflow.

823
00:52:42,286 --> 00:52:44,030
Scott: Wouldn't that be the highest ranked one?

824
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:44,270
Scott: Right.

825
00:52:44,691 --> 00:52:49,180
Scott: But no, if you do searches like that, the top results are all these shady websites.

826
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:54,266
Scott: I'm not going to name, but you can just tell that when you go to these websites, they're full of ads.

827
00:52:54,527 --> 00:52:55,688
Scott: They don't let you view them.

828
00:52:55,748 --> 00:53:00,474
Scott: If you don't, if you have an ad blocker, they're clearly content farmed and not written by humans.

829
00:53:00,514 --> 00:53:05,120
Scott: They've stolen content from stack overflow because stack overflow has a creative common sense.

830
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:07,126
Scott: I think most important user submitted content.

831
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:11,220
Scott: They often include just fucking wrong information.

832
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:12,201
Scott: Yeah.

833
00:53:12,301 --> 00:53:13,242
Scott: A lot of times they're wrong.

834
00:53:13,262 --> 00:53:15,886
Scott: Sometimes they're AI, you know, AI ML generated.

835
00:53:16,267 --> 00:53:16,487
Scott: Right.

836
00:53:17,309 --> 00:53:19,552
Scott: And this isn't just in the software world, though.

837
00:53:19,612 --> 00:53:23,839
Scott: When you're shopping, you'll get or looking for any kind of questions to things.

838
00:53:23,859 --> 00:53:24,780
Scott: You get listicles.

839
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,709
Scott: And it's like you expect Wikipedia to be the top result.

840
00:53:27,769 --> 00:53:28,532
Scott: And it's not.

841
00:53:28,612 --> 00:53:30,257
Scott: It's like way down for some reason.

842
00:53:30,277 --> 00:53:30,378
Scott: Right.

843
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:40,560
Rym: The moment it really hit for me is when I searched for something like Star Trek thing and some fandom.com wiki came up before the Wikipedia article about the series.

844
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:41,620
Scott: Yeah.

845
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:47,129
Scott: It's like the fandom.com wiki probably has the info, but shouldn't the Wikipedia be higher?

846
00:53:47,249 --> 00:53:47,449
Scott: Right.

847
00:53:47,469 --> 00:53:52,297
Scott: It's like it's not like Google is so bad that the results aren't there at all.

848
00:53:52,637 --> 00:53:54,180
Scott: It's just the ranking of them is bad.

849
00:53:54,681 --> 00:53:55,722
Scott: And there's lots of.

850
00:53:55,943 --> 00:54:02,633
Scott: not only are there the ads, which you know, I'm blocking, but it's there's a lot of garbage in the search results.

851
00:54:02,713 --> 00:54:06,880
Scott: It's not like in the Alta Vista days where, you know, 404 is in the search results.

852
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:08,000
Scott: Right.

853
00:54:08,461 --> 00:54:17,539
Scott: But it's still bad because basically it's like you get a whole bunch of search results and now you have to filter them with your eyes or by clicking on them and going back and forth until you find one.

854
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:18,260
Scott: that's not shit.

855
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:18,681
Scott: Right.

856
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:23,492
Scott: And so people obviously Google itself is less useful.

857
00:54:23,532 --> 00:54:25,757
Scott: People are searching Reddit directly.

858
00:54:25,777 --> 00:54:27,300
Scott: People are searching TikTok.

859
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:35,412
Rym: The meme you see out there among younger people is always type the word Reddit at the end of every Google search because of all the websites it's going to return.

860
00:54:35,752 --> 00:54:41,340
Rym: You actually want the Reddit because the Reddit is the place that's most likely to have a person who answers the question.

861
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:42,041
Scott: Yep.

862
00:54:42,061 --> 00:54:42,281
Scott: Yep.

863
00:54:44,744 --> 00:54:45,204
Rym: And it's.

864
00:54:45,725 --> 00:54:52,572
Rym: it's like it's getting worse rapidly, but there are no alternatives being doesn't return better results.

865
00:54:52,672 --> 00:54:53,373
Scott: if you're being as.

866
00:54:53,493 --> 00:54:56,836
Scott: I tried DuckDuckGo, which is the privacy focused search engine.

867
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:57,437
Scott: I tried it for like.

868
00:54:57,537 --> 00:55:00,240
Rym: I used DuckDuckGo still for exactly one thing.

869
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:15,320
Rym: If all if my primary, secondary and tertiary pirate sites for NHL hockey games fail, I go to DuckDuckGo because unlike Google, I can type NHL Rangers pirate stream and it will not block the results I'm looking for.

870
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:16,120
Scott: Yeah.

871
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,543
Scott: I mean, I used it and you know what?

872
00:55:17,643 --> 00:55:20,389
Scott: It was perfectly fine as the default search engine.

873
00:55:20,429 --> 00:55:23,215
Scott: I didn't really notice any upside or downside versus Google.

874
00:55:23,475 --> 00:55:25,179
Scott: Really, I would have kept using it.

875
00:55:25,319 --> 00:55:25,820
Scott: No problem.

876
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,945
Scott: But DuckDuckGo is just getting results from Bing.

877
00:55:28,965 --> 00:55:31,168
Scott: They don't have their own index.

878
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:39,160
Scott: They're basically just paying to use the Bing API to get results and then doing their own stuff on top of that and not tracking you.

879
00:55:39,821 --> 00:55:40,021
Scott: Yeah.

880
00:55:40,321 --> 00:55:43,826
Scott: So it's not really any better than Bing and the Bing searches.

881
00:55:44,387 --> 00:55:44,787
Scott: OK.

882
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:45,508
Scott: Right.

883
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:51,797
Scott: Like it still has listicles and all that kind of garbage in the results is not immune to the worst are the.

884
00:55:52,257 --> 00:55:54,240
Rym: if it looks like what you asked is a question.

885
00:55:55,080 --> 00:56:02,592
Rym: Google now will return at the top and it'll show like what it thinks is the answer to your question or it'll list like questions that thinks you're asking.

886
00:56:02,612 --> 00:56:07,540
Rym: I have literally found that those answers are just wrong more often than right.

887
00:56:07,841 --> 00:56:08,041
Scott: It is.

888
00:56:08,261 --> 00:56:11,087
Scott: It is sometimes wrong, but it's also sometimes right.

889
00:56:11,107 --> 00:56:17,280
Scott: It's basically just parsing out the highest search result and finding the part of the text that answers your question.

890
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:23,740
Scott: But often sometimes if that highest search result is messed up, then you're going to get the wrong answer in that extracted thing.

891
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:24,120
Scott: Yep.

892
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:41,380
Rym: And I guess, you know, I think what's happening here is we're at the cusp of another almost like a semantic apocalypse of the Internet in that there were catastrophic, sometimes good, sometimes bad shifts in how the Internet was used in that old search engines were originally curated.

893
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,484
Rym: Like we didn't really have machine learning back then that was usable.

894
00:56:44,564 --> 00:56:58,180
Rym: So like Yahoo and most search engines were more like indices where a human would decide like you'd have a staff who would say if someone searches for the Louisiana purchase, like what our websites we could recommend about that topic.

895
00:56:58,561 --> 00:56:58,701
Scott: Yeah.

896
00:56:58,861 --> 00:57:01,687
Scott: And that was obviously untenable because that weren't.

897
00:57:01,707 --> 00:57:04,573
Rym: when you could buy books in the bookstore that listed every website.

898
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:06,997
Scott: There was a time it was one book that listed everywhere.

899
00:57:07,017 --> 00:57:07,859
Rym: I used to buy that book.

900
00:57:10,481 --> 00:57:10,641
Scott: Okay.

901
00:57:10,661 --> 00:57:11,343
Rym: Anyway, this was the 80s.

902
00:57:11,503 --> 00:57:11,844
Rym: Yeah.

903
00:57:11,864 --> 00:57:14,691
Scott: So I think it was the 90s.

904
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:15,232
Scott: The book was in.

905
00:57:15,252 --> 00:57:16,455
Rym: there were still books in the 90s.

906
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:18,500
Rym: There were still books that had URLs you would type in.

907
00:57:19,361 --> 00:57:25,434
Rym: Then there was the attempts at search engines that would basically just crawl websites and look for keywords.

908
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,940
Rym: And that worked okay when there weren't that many websites.

909
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:36,671
Rym: But then people realized, especially with the profit motive, you could trick those engines by putting a bunch of keywords unrelated all over your website.

910
00:57:37,132 --> 00:57:43,420
Rym: A lot of websites used to have a bunch of text in the HTML that didn't show up in the web page to try to trick all those search engines.

911
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:44,260
Scott: People still try to do that.

912
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:44,861
Rym: They still do.

913
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:59,520
Rym: But those search engines went over the span of like a couple years, maybe less, went from working better than the human curated ones that were all 404s to return nothing but garbage spam sites because they couldn't differentiate content from spam.

914
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:05,766
Rym: Google was kind of ahead of its time and Alta Vista, you know, we go all the way back.

915
00:58:06,406 --> 00:58:17,600
Rym: They moved into a model of trying to look at what websites were linked to more often to figure out what humans had in aggregate decided were better places to look for information.

916
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:25,740
Rym: And then they started to tune their search results based on what did people link to with the keywords that this person is searching for?

917
00:58:26,721 --> 00:58:27,783
Rym: That was very clever.

918
00:58:27,903 --> 00:58:33,294
Rym: And that's the basis of almost all of Google up until Google decided to sell it sold to the advertisers.

919
00:58:33,314 --> 00:58:34,737
Rym: That's kind of how Google worked.

920
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:35,960
Rym: If you squint and zoom out.

921
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,764
Rym: Yeah, but I don't think that can work anymore, and I think that's how people that's.

922
00:58:41,964 --> 00:58:46,128
Scott: that's why you get like all these people even today, like, hey, post my.

923
00:58:46,228 --> 00:58:55,636
Scott: I'll pay you to put my blog post by paid content on your blog because your blog has Google juice and this blog content has links to my website.

924
00:58:55,956 --> 00:58:56,476
Scott: that will ink.

925
00:58:56,517 --> 00:59:00,520
Scott: that will better make my search results better if I can get you to post it.

926
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:06,640
Scott: So I'm willing to pay you to put your content on front row, get emails, get spam emails for that.

927
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:14,090
Rym: I was about to say the only spam that ever, ever gets through my Google filters is that spam, even though I report it's actually.

928
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:21,300
Scott: it's because it doesn't come through as spam because it's actually humans actually emailing you trying to get you to do that, who will pay you money to do it.

929
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:22,801
Rym: It's not.

930
00:59:23,141 --> 00:59:24,422
Scott: it's not a lie or anything.

931
00:59:24,502 --> 00:59:31,308
Scott: It's like they will pay you money to post their blog post on your blog because it will help their Google biz, which tells you something important.

932
00:59:32,209 --> 00:59:44,100
Rym: It is that valuable to get Google juice to an advertiser scummy scammer type person that they will give you real money in good faith to help them try to game the Google algorithm.

933
00:59:45,301 --> 00:59:46,402
Rym: Like that is that.

934
00:59:46,502 --> 00:59:48,686
Rym: that's just underlines the problem.

935
00:59:48,966 --> 00:59:50,288
Rym: It puts a spotlight on it.

936
00:59:50,849 --> 00:59:58,180
Rym: But Google in the old days try used to more heavily really try to resist that and return.

937
00:59:58,380 --> 00:59:59,560
Scott: Or they succeeded at doing it.

938
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,478
Rym: Well, they succeeded.

939
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:02,624
Scott: They would occasionally basically like.

940
01:00:03,025 --> 01:00:05,089
Scott: all the SEO people would frequently get mad.

941
01:00:05,129 --> 01:00:07,013
Scott: They'd be like, oh, no, Google change things again.

942
01:00:07,033 --> 01:00:10,120
Scott: Sort of like, you know, the Matrix and this deja vu, like they change something.

943
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:10,280
Scott: Right.

944
01:00:10,321 --> 01:00:10,642
Scott: It's like.

945
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:16,120
Scott: and then all the SEO people would get big mad because now they had to re relearn like their whole industry.

946
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:16,361
Scott: Right.

947
01:00:16,501 --> 01:00:23,460
Rym: Well, every other human using the Internet would breathe a sigh of relief because every time Google did this, search results got really good again and spam disappeared.

948
01:00:24,361 --> 01:00:24,581
Scott: Yeah.

949
01:00:24,842 --> 01:00:31,359
Scott: But the SEO people were like, oh, no, we have to change all of our techniques and learn all the new rules in order to get our results.

950
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:35,060
Scott: You know, I need my websites to be the top result for these queries.

951
01:00:35,321 --> 01:00:41,340
Rym: So I think two things happened and I don't know which one happened first or which one is the ultimate cause.

952
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:45,207
Rym: And it maybe doesn't matter, but caused probably thing one number one that happened.

953
01:00:46,148 --> 01:00:52,620
Rym: Google dropped its don't be evil motto and Google makes all of its money from spam and advertising.

954
01:00:53,421 --> 01:00:53,661
Scott: Yeah.

955
01:00:54,062 --> 01:00:57,631
Scott: So basically, you know, is this 100 percent true?

956
01:00:57,691 --> 01:00:58,132
Scott: I don't know.

957
01:00:58,213 --> 01:01:01,080
Scott: But you can't looking at the evidence, it's hard to believe anything else.

958
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:05,428
Scott: Google makes money from these sites that are full of ads.

959
01:01:05,529 --> 01:01:10,420
Scott: Google doesn't really make as much money if you end up going to Wikipedia, which isn't hosting Google ads.

960
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,959
Scott: They don't make as much money if you go to the official Python documentation that doesn't have any ads on it.

961
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:15,240
Scott: Right.

962
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:23,020
Scott: So if you Google search something and you're not using ad blocks or anything like, you know, if you're a normal person, you Google search something.

963
01:01:24,102 --> 01:01:26,067
Scott: You see ads that Google makes money.

964
01:01:26,087 --> 01:01:30,738
Scott: If you click on those ads that Google makes money, you click on a result.

965
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:31,440
Scott: Right.

966
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:35,925
Scott: Google will only make money if you go to a page that has Google ads on it,

967
01:01:36,365 --> 01:01:48,640
Rym: which implies even if every human inside of Google wants to do the right thing, Google as an entity is incentivized even indirectly or via dark patterns and entirely without anyone human deciding to do this.

968
01:01:49,221 --> 01:01:54,488
Rym: It will gradually incentivize anything that causes the ads to be clicked on more often.

969
01:01:54,589 --> 01:02:02,260
Rym: And thus, the entity that is Google has a vested interest in spam results coming up frequently enough for people to click on them.

970
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:11,600
Scott: Whether that is truly their nefarious and evil intent, the fact remains that if Google were to go and remove, there's like some of these, it's so easy.

971
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,644
Scott: It's like they're just domains that you can see.

972
01:02:13,684 --> 01:02:16,309
Scott: the whole domain is nothing but content farm bullshit.

973
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:22,380
Scott: It would be trivial for Google to just wreck a human to just like, you know, there aren't that many of them.

974
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:22,921
Scott: Right.

975
01:02:22,961 --> 01:02:23,864
Scott: It's like it wouldn't take.

976
01:02:23,884 --> 01:02:29,200
Scott: it wouldn't be, you know, indexing the whole Internet is not a problem humans can solve.

977
01:02:29,661 --> 01:02:41,780
Scott: But manually taking in reports of which domains are evil and completely eliminating those domains from the index entirely is something that could be achieved with human effort in short order.

978
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:42,701
Scott: Right.

979
01:02:42,741 --> 01:02:44,145
Rym: It's a pretty short list.

980
01:02:44,185 --> 01:02:49,080
Rym: Like you showed me that list of the the most frequently blocked domains on that paid search or trying out Kagi.

981
01:02:49,441 --> 01:02:52,411
Rym: And it's like it's like a who's like the domains I would like instantly.

982
01:02:52,913 --> 01:02:55,100
Scott: A huge amount of the problem could be solved.

983
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:59,013
Scott: Like Google could just be like, you know what, no more Pinterest results in Google Images.

984
01:02:59,073 --> 01:03:01,120
Scott: That would take two seconds for Google to do.

985
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:01,963
Rym: Oh, my God.

986
01:03:02,023 --> 01:03:02,386
Rym: That would.

987
01:03:02,426 --> 01:03:04,440
Rym: that would make my life a lot better.

988
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:04,760
Scott: Right.

989
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:05,101
Scott: Exactly.

990
01:03:05,121 --> 01:03:05,843
Scott: They just don't do it.

991
01:03:05,883 --> 01:03:11,880
Scott: They just allow that to continue when it would be trivial to stop and just say, sorry, your website is a bunch of bullshit.

992
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:13,607
Scott: You're doing bullshit on your website, your blog.

993
01:03:13,627 --> 01:03:16,097
Scott: Google could do that and they don't.

994
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:17,361
Scott: Right.

995
01:03:17,803 --> 01:03:21,740
Scott: So the fact that they don't sort of tells you all you need to know.

996
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:21,921
Scott: Right.

997
01:03:21,941 --> 01:03:26,959
Scott: There is an easy thing they could do to fix this problem and they don't.

998
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,372
Rym: But there is a second problem happening.

999
01:03:29,413 --> 01:03:30,619
Scott: And this is nowhere else to go.

1000
01:03:31,221 --> 01:03:32,403
Rym: But this isn't Google's fault.

1001
01:03:32,844 --> 01:03:41,560
Rym: This is the combination of the proliferation of content farms means that the majority of the content on the Internet is content farms.

1002
01:03:41,981 --> 01:03:48,560
Rym: And that is accelerating due to chat GPT and large language models like shit.

1003
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:57,540
Rym: Garbage content farm stuff is going to be almost every website on the Internet, like within a year or so.

1004
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:04,340
Rym: It's probably already the majority of all websites you could ever hit with a browser if you could hit every website.

1005
01:04:05,001 --> 01:04:17,180
Scott: If they refuse to block domains, then and they index the whole Internet, the Google search results are naturally, no matter what the algorithm is, a reflection of the content on the Internet.

1006
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:23,240
Scott: And if the majority of the content on the Internet is just a bunch of bullshit, the majority of the search results are going to be just a bunch of bullshit.

1007
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:36,140
Scott: Now, you would need some special search engine, right, where I don't know how you'd figure out which domains are hosting real content and only index those and don't search the rest of the Web at all.

1008
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:47,520
Rym: Now, one way to approach this would be now from a system, from a technology standpoint, if the Internet is flooded with large language model and ML generated content farm bullshit.

1009
01:04:48,261 --> 01:04:59,380
Rym: But at the same time, the users of a search engine want to find real content, then other machine learning models could be used to prioritize content people actually want to see.

1010
01:05:00,081 --> 01:05:02,668
Rym: And it would just be a battle between two competing networks.

1011
01:05:02,968 --> 01:05:07,140
Rym: The problem is nobody makes money if you do that.

1012
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:09,179
Rym: And that would be very expensive to do.

1013
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,582
Scott: The people with the A.I.

1014
01:05:10,622 --> 01:05:13,848
Scott: that fights to get the spam in have a source of revenue.

1015
01:05:13,908 --> 01:05:17,194
Scott: The people who have the the the A.I.

1016
01:05:17,254 --> 01:05:18,877
Scott: to keep the spam out are just.

1017
01:05:18,897 --> 01:05:19,918
Scott: it's just a cost hole.

1018
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:20,840
Scott: It's just a money hole.

1019
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,408
Rym: But I think you could solve the value you get out of.

1020
01:05:24,428 --> 01:05:25,872
Scott: that doesn't come in dollars.

1021
01:05:25,932 --> 01:05:29,140
Scott: It comes in human time, you know, and whatnot.

1022
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:42,680
Rym: But I think to your point, at least for the next five or six years, you could you could stop the bleeding in a material way by blocking a finite, well-known number of domains and just agreeing, fuck these websites and fuck these domains.

1023
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:44,123
Scott: You could just.

1024
01:05:44,224 --> 01:05:45,428
Scott: it's like you'd be surprised.

1025
01:05:45,448 --> 01:05:48,016
Scott: You know, we keep talking about ML and A.I.

1026
01:05:48,136 --> 01:05:48,979
Scott: and stuff like that.

1027
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:49,220
Scott: Right.

1028
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:58,373
Scott: There are some surprisingly simple techniques that are like so brain dead, yet so ridiculously, like surprisingly effective.

1029
01:05:58,393 --> 01:06:03,360
Scott: You know, the the old Bayesian spam filter algorithm, that shit still works.

1030
01:06:03,941 --> 01:06:04,161
Scott: Right.

1031
01:06:04,462 --> 01:06:06,846
Scott: And it works impressively well even now.

1032
01:06:06,926 --> 01:06:07,527
Scott: Is it perfect?

1033
01:06:07,767 --> 01:06:07,988
Scott: No.

1034
01:06:08,068 --> 01:06:10,612
Scott: Is it as as good as what we have now?

1035
01:06:10,993 --> 01:06:11,233
Scott: No.

1036
01:06:11,594 --> 01:06:13,517
Scott: But it works really, really well.

1037
01:06:13,557 --> 01:06:15,080
Scott: Like you'd be shocked at how well it works.

1038
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:18,889
Scott: There are other methods, for example, like if you want to get rid of listicles.

1039
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:19,130
Scott: Right.

1040
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:22,639
Scott: Which are a really common SEO framework, you know, trick.

1041
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:23,200
Scott: Right.

1042
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:40,068
Scott: If you just filter out all websites that have like certain patterns of phrases in the title, like top number in year number, you know, the top X in top number X. The title of the Web page is always going to be some form of that pattern.

1043
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:46,360
Scott: You can just take any website that has that pattern in the title and eliminate it from the search results entirely.

1044
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:47,542
Scott: Or you can even say.

1045
01:06:47,602 --> 01:06:50,749
Scott: Unless the search query also matches that pattern.

1046
01:06:50,769 --> 01:06:51,891
Rym: That's what I was about to say.

1047
01:06:51,971 --> 01:06:52,332
Rym: If I type.

1048
01:06:52,352 --> 01:06:53,554
Scott: For listicles on purpose.

1049
01:06:53,614 --> 01:06:54,296
Scott: Yeah.

1050
01:06:54,356 --> 01:06:56,380
Rym: If I'm searching for listicles, return me listicles.

1051
01:06:57,161 --> 01:06:58,283
Scott: Right.

1052
01:06:58,503 --> 01:07:02,749
Scott: And it's like that cleans the search results up like super, super hard.

1053
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:10,860
Rym: But even better, human curation, because the bad content is so obvious and comes from so few sources.

1054
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:13,163
Rym: And that's not going to change as quickly as everything else.

1055
01:07:14,686 --> 01:07:24,260
Rym: Ad block, most ad block software to this day relies on a relative, surprisingly short human curated list of URL patterns and domains.

1056
01:07:24,901 --> 01:07:26,264
Scott: Like, yeah, it's like the ad block.

1057
01:07:26,304 --> 01:07:29,391
Scott: people are human curating lists of bad domains.

1058
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:33,700
Scott: You could just go get like easy list or one of those ad block to Google.

1059
01:07:33,941 --> 01:07:34,382
Rym: Good to go.

1060
01:07:34,462 --> 01:07:41,340
Scott: and just Google would end up blocking its own stuff because Google Analytics is in most of those lists by all of those lists.

1061
01:07:41,661 --> 01:07:47,914
Scott: But yet you would just remove those from the search index, like if it's a site, you know, or you could also like your.

1062
01:07:48,175 --> 01:07:50,580
Scott: Google is looking at the source code of every Web page.

1063
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:50,901
Scott: Right.

1064
01:07:51,201 --> 01:08:01,060
Scott: So they could be like, all right, if we detect that on the Web page there is some sort of anti ad block measure, then, you know, we will remove that site from the search index.

1065
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:07,580
Scott: If we detect that on the Web page, there is some sort of, you know, various kinds of bullshit scripts and tracking.

1066
01:08:07,961 --> 01:08:09,527
Scott: We'll remove that from the search index.

1067
01:08:09,547 --> 01:08:13,120
Scott: that you will never no one will ever find that Web page right in our search results.

1068
01:08:13,501 --> 01:08:15,470
Scott: That would be very easy for Google to do.

1069
01:08:16,696 --> 01:08:17,600
Scott: Of course, they won't do that.

1070
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:27,819
Rym: Yeah, well, it would be better for the users, better for humanity, better for society, better for the Internet, worse for Google, worse for the people who invest in Google, worse for scammers and advertisers.

1071
01:08:28,279 --> 01:08:32,555
Scott: You could say, well, why doesn't someone come around and compete with Google and do exactly what I just said?

1072
01:08:32,615 --> 01:08:33,920
Scott: Wouldn't all the users go there?

1073
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:36,136
Scott: And the answer is yes and no.

1074
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:36,620
Rym: Right.

1075
01:08:36,819 --> 01:08:50,319
Rym: I mean, case in point, look at if look at TV, YouTube without without ad block, a lot of humans don't have a lot of money because capitalism, they are more than willing to just accept all that crap to get free content.

1076
01:08:51,600 --> 01:09:01,040
Scott: But also it's like, all right, let's say if I want to make a search engine to compete with Google right it to build it from nothing is so incredibly difficult.

1077
01:09:01,502 --> 01:09:01,783
Scott: Right.

1078
01:09:02,064 --> 01:09:06,640
Scott: Think about some of the features Google has, like when you misspell something, but they know what you actually wrote.

1079
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:07,020
Scott: Yeah.

1080
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:16,359
Scott: You know, or you know, having all those bots and all those computing resources index the entire Web over and over again, updating the content quickly.

1081
01:09:16,881 --> 01:09:21,037
Scott: It's like it is such an enormous cost to get into the business.

1082
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:21,540
Scott: Right.

1083
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:26,080
Scott: It's like, oh, I'll just compete with the I want to compete with Samsung and making TVs.

1084
01:09:26,261 --> 01:09:28,760
Scott: It's like, all right, you have enough money to make a TV factory.

1085
01:09:29,643 --> 01:09:30,846
Scott: No, no, I don't.

1086
01:09:31,247 --> 01:09:31,469
Scott: Right.

1087
01:09:31,870 --> 01:09:34,299
Scott: Well, then you can't even get started in that business, can you?

1088
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:34,640
Scott: Right.

1089
01:09:36,081 --> 01:09:42,859
Scott: So to make a search engine that's actually scalable, indexing the whole Web is such an enormous endeavor.

1090
01:09:42,961 --> 01:09:44,193
Scott: You can't get in the business.

1091
01:09:44,698 --> 01:09:44,899
Scott: Right.

1092
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:52,140
Scott: And even if you could and you were and you behaved and you did all some of those good suggestions we talked about and maybe some more.

1093
01:09:52,743 --> 01:09:54,320
Scott: How would you make any fucking money?

1094
01:09:54,380 --> 01:10:00,460
Rym: Because you can't make the money Google makes with advertising because advertising is the thing everyone's trying to escape and avoid.

1095
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:08,560
Rym: And the people and even though there are ways to escape that in many forms of media, most people don't like I do.

1096
01:10:08,921 --> 01:10:13,439
Rym: If I couldn't if there was no way to watch YouTube without ads, I would never watch YouTube video again.

1097
01:10:14,982 --> 01:10:16,307
Scott: So there is actually.

1098
01:10:16,327 --> 01:10:19,440
Scott: I recently discovered somebody who did make a search engine.

1099
01:10:19,921 --> 01:10:20,102
Scott: Right.

1100
01:10:20,403 --> 01:10:26,120
Scott: I don't want to advertise them, but they made a search engine that is a not free search engine.

1101
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:30,640
Scott: It's like you can use it for free and do like one hundred searches and then it's like, all right, you're done.

1102
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,427
Rym: You blew through that in like ten minutes.

1103
01:10:32,488 --> 01:10:35,179
Scott: I want to say I went through it in exactly twenty four hours.

1104
01:10:38,101 --> 01:10:38,905
Scott: It's like I try.

1105
01:10:38,945 --> 01:10:42,520
Scott: I started a free trial one morning and the next morning it's like your free trial is done.

1106
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:53,449
Scott: You did one hundred searches to bed and you can pay real money after that point to get, you know, either a limited number of queries or pay more money to get infinite queries.

1107
01:10:55,574 --> 01:10:57,879
Scott: And is the search engine better?

1108
01:10:58,961 --> 01:10:59,803
Scott: Yes, it's better.

1109
01:10:59,823 --> 01:11:00,384
Scott: Right.

1110
01:11:01,026 --> 01:11:02,250
Scott: Is it worth paying for?

1111
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:06,100
Scott: It's like maybe if you do one hundred searches a day like I do, maybe.

1112
01:11:06,541 --> 01:11:06,842
Scott: Right.

1113
01:11:07,283 --> 01:11:07,664
Scott: Maybe.

1114
01:11:07,684 --> 01:11:09,469
Scott: Is it perfect, though?

1115
01:11:09,609 --> 01:11:10,351
Scott: No, it's got.

1116
01:11:10,431 --> 01:11:13,720
Scott: it still has a lot of problems because it's a small little company.

1117
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:14,400
Rym: Right.

1118
01:11:14,581 --> 01:11:30,244
Rym: It's a different paradigm because the fundamental problem with almost everything we complain about and have complained about on the Internet as two guys doing a podcast since 2005 is that if you pay for a product, you are paying for the product.

1119
01:11:30,485 --> 01:11:34,440
Rym: If you don't pay for the product, you're still paying, but you're paying in some other way.

1120
01:11:35,042 --> 01:11:40,979
Rym: And generally, products you pay for with money are almost always better than products you pay for with anything else.

1121
01:11:43,342 --> 01:11:47,191
Scott: But, yeah, this this pay search engine has quite a few features.

1122
01:11:47,271 --> 01:11:51,000
Scott: For example, the ability to block domains.

1123
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:52,224
Scott: You don't want to see in results.

1124
01:11:53,167 --> 01:11:54,572
Scott: You can or you can like raise.

1125
01:11:54,592 --> 01:12:01,760
Scott: you can manually raise and lower some domains and you can actually pin a domain and saying if this domain is in the results, always put it at the top.

1126
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:05,688
Scott: Yeah, it tells you there's a little thing you can click on.

1127
01:12:05,768 --> 01:12:11,580
Scott: It'll tell you whether the Web site in the search result has like ad trackers on that Web site.

1128
01:12:12,821 --> 01:12:22,940
Scott: If the Web sites faster, slow, there's a quick links to like open the result in the Web archive or, you know, to summarize the page for you.

1129
01:12:23,441 --> 01:12:25,967
Scott: They're on the right track with a lot of their features.

1130
01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:32,080
Scott: And I'd say it's better than DuckDuckGo, at least from my using it.

1131
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:38,100
Scott: The question is, for you individually, are you searching so much that you're going to pay money?

1132
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:38,580
Rym: Yep.

1133
01:12:38,901 --> 01:12:40,725
Rym: I mean, same thing with YouTube.

1134
01:12:40,985 --> 01:12:48,340
Rym: How many of you are using YouTube with the ads because you have to prioritize not paying however much that costs a month because capitalism?

1135
01:12:49,201 --> 01:12:49,361
Scott: Yep.

1136
01:12:49,903 --> 01:12:53,191
Scott: So I can't recommend that everyone pay for it.

1137
01:12:53,251 --> 01:12:53,432
Scott: Right.

1138
01:12:53,512 --> 01:12:56,239
Scott: Even though because it's not it's not like dramatically better.

1139
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:56,500
Scott: Right.

1140
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:58,426
Scott: It's like I was living with Google just fine.

1141
01:12:58,868 --> 01:13:02,479
Scott: It's like you have to be a really search heavy person for it to be worth it for you.

1142
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:03,924
Rym: And it is also.

1143
01:13:03,944 --> 01:13:09,560
Rym: it still is searching the insidified Web filled with content farm nonsense everywhere.

1144
01:13:10,401 --> 01:13:10,601
Scott: Yeah.

1145
01:13:10,621 --> 01:13:16,135
Scott: It's like it's not completely immune from bad results because you're still searching the Web.

1146
01:13:16,195 --> 01:13:16,957
Scott: The Web is the Web.

1147
01:13:16,997 --> 01:13:17,138
Scott: Right.

1148
01:13:17,158 --> 01:13:17,960
Scott: They're doing their best.

1149
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:19,884
Rym: We could see a divide over time.

1150
01:13:19,904 --> 01:13:27,560
Rym: Remember the old, old, old days where back when we said search engines barely worked, there was the Lexus Nexus where you could pay.

1151
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:28,322
Scott: Those still exist.

1152
01:13:28,342 --> 01:13:28,422
Scott: Yeah.

1153
01:13:28,924 --> 01:13:32,375
Rym: But there were professional searches of very like.

1154
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,137
Rym: that was one example.

1155
01:13:33,157 --> 01:13:33,920
Rym: There was a bunch of them.

1156
01:13:34,361 --> 01:13:38,496
Rym: Usually they were all industry or domain specific and they were not cheap.

1157
01:13:38,576 --> 01:13:39,740
Rym: They were very expensive.

1158
01:13:40,381 --> 01:13:56,440
Rym: I could definitely see a future like in the next few years, even where there are a proliferation of domain specific, very expensive search engines that are curated by or offered by professionals in industries aimed at professionals.

1159
01:13:56,821 --> 01:14:08,260
Rym: Just like like Creative Cloud, Adobe software is marketed at professionals and you pay a lot of money for it, which will lead to, once again, a bifurcation between the Internet that most people have access to.

1160
01:14:08,761 --> 01:14:10,084
Rym: And the rich professionals Internet.

1161
01:14:10,104 --> 01:14:12,329
Rym: that is completely different and just better in every way.

1162
01:14:13,572 --> 01:14:16,900
Scott: The thing is, people don't really want that so much.

1163
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,142
Scott: Oh, I'm not saying people want it.

1164
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:19,204
Rym: I'm saying it's going to happen.

1165
01:14:20,526 --> 01:14:20,967
Scott: I don't know.

1166
01:14:21,127 --> 01:14:28,760
Scott: I think, you know, you look at like nothing stops people right now from like, you know, going to Wikipedia and searching instead of going on Google for.

1167
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:29,802
Rym: I do that often.

1168
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:39,820
Rym: I search Wikipedia directly way more often than I use Google, because honestly, 90 percent of the time, if I'm typing anything into Google, I would just be looking for a specific Wikipedia page.

1169
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:40,121
Rym: Right.

1170
01:14:40,161 --> 01:14:44,149
Scott: But I guess you're a weirdo, but most people don't actually do that so much.

1171
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:44,510
Scott: Right.

1172
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:48,980
Scott: It's like people go to Google search and might end up on the Wikipedia result.

1173
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:51,884
Scott: But it's like there is other information out there.

1174
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:52,565
Scott: Right.

1175
01:14:52,785 --> 01:14:54,488
Scott: That, you know, on the whole Web.

1176
01:14:54,528 --> 01:15:03,220
Scott: And as soon as you have these sort of sealed off, you know, siloed things like that, which are domain specific, there's a whole lot of stuff out there that you're now missing.

1177
01:15:04,742 --> 01:15:06,524
Scott: And it's not all of it is the bullshit.

1178
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:09,207
Scott: There's like good stuff out there that it's like you want.

1179
01:15:09,247 --> 01:15:12,131
Scott: That's what you really want out of the search engine is like.

1180
01:15:12,532 --> 01:15:19,200
Scott: that's the success is like if the search engine can find something that's high value, that's just out on the Web.

1181
01:15:19,761 --> 01:15:19,941
Scott: Right.

1182
01:15:19,981 --> 01:15:22,607
Scott: You never would have found any other possible way.

1183
01:15:23,208 --> 01:15:25,533
Scott: That's like the real goal of that.

1184
01:15:25,894 --> 01:15:28,920
Scott: And that happens, I think, not very often.

1185
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:31,142
Rym: Well, I think that that almost that is more.

1186
01:15:31,602 --> 01:15:47,215
Rym: the curated Internet is the real future where, like, I get the impression a lot of gig nights listeners, the listener, a big part of what you like about our thing is just those things of the day, because every couple of days, here's two links you might not have clicked on.

1187
01:15:47,235 --> 01:15:48,896
Rym: You never would have found in a Google search.

1188
01:15:49,537 --> 01:15:53,880
Rym: And it's a curated feed of things we liked that we saw on the Internet.

1189
01:16:00,092 --> 01:16:02,357
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:58,370
Rym: Most of you are given like a dollar or a pound or something, I assume, to get that sweet Patreon RSS feed.

1201
01:16:59,012 --> 01:17:03,830
Rym: Yeah, we're back mostly doing shows consistently, I think, for the foreseeable future.

1202
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:09,030
Rym: Stay tuned for PAX West, or sorry, PAX Unplugged, where we'll have those two panels we talked about.

1203
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:15,990
Rym: They'll be posted on the site probably when the schedule goes up for both, just so I could have something to link to on the PAX website.

1204
01:17:16,771 --> 01:17:24,489
Rym: And otherwise, I'll just leave you with... Ladies and gentlemen, the Royal Tarts have arrived!

1205
01:17:30,013 --> 01:17:32,550
Media: ...or here, but he can feel your movement.

1206
01:17:33,391 --> 01:17:33,915
Media: Hello?

1207
01:17:34,902 --> 01:17:35,990
Media: Eat my tarts?

1208
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:49,770
Media: This cosmic dance of bursting decadence and withheld permissions twists all our arms collectively, but if sweetness can win, bandit can.

1209
01:17:50,530 --> 01:17:57,030
Media: Then I'll still be here tomorrow to high-five you yesterday, my friend.

1210
01:17:58,166 --> 01:17:58,389
Media: Peace.
