1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,828
Rym: Hey, it's Thursday November 12th.

2
00:00:12,249 --> 00:00:12,690
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,011 --> 00:00:16,300
Rym: I'm Scott over Skype, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:16,863 --> 00:00:17,448
Rym: couches.

5
00:00:17,468 --> 00:00:18,396
Rym: yeah couches.

6
00:00:25,874 --> 00:00:26,603
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:31,063 --> 00:00:36,600
Rym: So yesterday Emily, and I just stayed in the city and hung out at Scott's ultra modern swank apartment.

8
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:41,413
Scott: Yes, the luxuries of ultra modernists are plenty.

9
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:42,697
Rym: god damn example.

10
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:45,692
Scott: dishwashing Is automatic.

11
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:46,399
Scott: you push a button.

12
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:57,170
Rym: It was stylish and cool and in the city and and the worst part wasn't like the worst part I have worst stuck in my head from when we reviewed D&D online.

13
00:00:57,772 --> 00:01:05,619
Rym: I get back home to beacon like today and suddenly beacon felt a thousand times more provincial than it used to.

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,108
Scott: It was like.

15
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:14,499
Rym: The thing is I was gonna buy a house in beacon, and I'm still like vaguely exploring that.

16
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:23,828
Rym: but For those of you who haven't been following the forum in the deeper details of the Rym and Scott experience the house I was trying to buy the dude.

17
00:01:23,868 --> 00:01:30,019
Rym: I was buying it from totally skip town Like completely and the bank is like fuck.

18
00:01:30,642 --> 00:01:36,259
Rym: We can't sell it to you until we foreclose on this guy foreclosures gonna take forever and be a pain in the ass.

19
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:40,805
Scott: It should be right.

20
00:01:40,905 --> 00:01:46,320
Scott: in the perfect world you go to the judge you just show them some evidence like look this guy skipped town.

21
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,003
Scott: We're a bank.

22
00:01:47,465 --> 00:01:53,111
Scott: We're the bank and the judge says he bangs the hammer And he says the house is taken away from that guy.

23
00:01:53,172 --> 00:02:02,326
Rym: the thing is there's a lot of protection For people who like a family living in a house who like suddenly come on tough times to make sure that they don't Immediately get foreclosed on that.

24
00:02:02,347 --> 00:02:03,210
Rym: sometimes once

25
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:17,828
Scott: a week once a week right for like an hour The judge go drives around town with the banks if they need to and they show them the houses that no one is in and They say judge give us this house, and the judge bangs his hammer on the grass and says okay Then

26
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:18,350
Rym: I come back.

27
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,898
Rym: I'm like I was on vacation Jesus.

28
00:02:22,482 --> 00:02:29,268
Rym: So I failed and I got my 20 grand deposit back and I lost a couple grand worth of like paying my lawyer.

29
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:38,511
Rym: Luckily this lawyer because he threw.

30
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:39,820
Rym: he was so sure he could get the house.

31
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:46,360
Rym: I had him on retainer And I only paid him like this initial fee And I only had to pay him all the rest of the money if I got the house.

32
00:02:46,663 --> 00:02:50,837
Rym: So he basically did all this work for nothing Same with my realtor.

33
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,070
Rym: Yeah, oh wow.

34
00:02:53,090 --> 00:03:02,616
Rym: Yeah, she works for me Yep, and she worked for me for over a year and like did a lot of work on my behalf And she got absolutely no money.

35
00:03:02,697 --> 00:03:04,945
Scott: nothing It sucks.

36
00:03:05,086 --> 00:03:07,400
Scott: yeah, you should you should give her a present or something.

37
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:11,172
Rym: Yeah, the thing is I had like all the you know my whole thing the Horatio thing.

38
00:03:11,212 --> 00:03:15,859
Rym: we haven't been on an FNPL lately So I can't bring up the whole Horatio hornblower metaphor.

39
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:35,480
Rym: You know Horatio Nelson But the idea that you know the people who are successful who wants to know exactly how much to leave to chance you wait for That Horatio moment and whenever there's a Horatio moment you make the big move and you otherwise Never make a big move unless you're forced to and you defer all decisions until you cannot defer them any further.

40
00:03:35,942 --> 00:03:37,027
Scott: That is precisely correct.

41
00:03:37,188 --> 00:03:39,580
Rym: That's like the game theory way to succeed at everything.

42
00:03:39,801 --> 00:03:42,920
Scott: Yeah, you should you know you should send like some go to the flowers website.

43
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:44,606
Rym: I'm gonna do something for me like.

44
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:47,980
Scott: I am sorry that you worked all this time and got nothing.

45
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:48,562
Rym: Yeah,

46
00:03:48,582 --> 00:04:03,099
Scott: like imagine if you worked at your job all year on like a project and then at the end They just decided not to use it And then they didn't pay you and they took basically if you worked half a day on it for you know a year They just took half your money away.

47
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,868
Rym: So pretty much.

48
00:04:06,392 --> 00:04:17,834
Rym: I had two other Horatio Movements and one was buy another house in Beacon because their houses prices dropped even more and it got the point to where I could Basically buy one of those McMansions like a big one straight up.

49
00:04:18,095 --> 00:04:19,380
Rym: just no trouble at all.

50
00:04:19,962 --> 00:04:21,065
Rym: So I sent her a list of like.

51
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:27,002
Rym: these are the nine houses near the train station that are all nice and mansiony that I would like to look at and A week later.

52
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:27,584
Rym: She came back.

53
00:04:27,645 --> 00:04:36,780
Rym: I just got the full info yesterday, and she's like yeah Seven of those are short sales and the last one is currently in foreclosure.

54
00:04:37,881 --> 00:04:41,812
Scott: Well that means the last one you know might be out of foreclosure soon enough.

55
00:04:41,892 --> 00:04:44,760
Rym: the last one had been converted into three apartments.

56
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:52,833
Scott: That's not what I live in one and rent - Yeah, yeah, but look at the kind of be kind of fun to live in an interesting.

57
00:04:52,853 --> 00:04:55,970
Rym: I did that though I did that for a while.

58
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,619
Rym: remember when I lived in Fishkill in the box.

59
00:04:58,742 --> 00:05:00,719
Scott: Yeah, no, I mean you if you owe it would be more.

60
00:05:01,183 --> 00:05:02,189
Rym: You know if I owned it.

61
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,880
Rym: if I'm the jolly landlord I come home And I'm like sup Jim living in apartment X waiting for that.

62
00:05:07,663 --> 00:05:10,272
Scott: I mean you live in all three of them at once.

63
00:05:10,673 --> 00:05:13,980
Rym: I have like that'd be weird That's what I'm saying.

64
00:05:15,224 --> 00:05:23,060
Rym: But basically it's all like this gigantic pain in the ass and it got to the point to where it was basically impossible to buy a house in Beacon without drama.

65
00:05:24,043 --> 00:05:25,131
Rym: So I was like all right.

66
00:05:25,453 --> 00:05:26,158
Rym: I got money.

67
00:05:26,198 --> 00:05:40,619
Rym: now Let's just look like further down closer to the city buy a house and like one of the up more fancy Half the size of the one I was looking at caused more than twice as much.

68
00:05:41,522 --> 00:05:42,992
Scott: Why don't you check out some Dobbs Ferry?

69
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:43,032
Scott: I?

70
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,066
Rym: Did I look around?

71
00:05:45,186 --> 00:05:46,820
Scott: it's apparently starting to get happening?

72
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:50,719
Rym: Yeah, so I looked around and I was just fail fail fail fail fail.

73
00:05:51,482 --> 00:05:55,820
Rym: And then I looked on the other train lines, and it's actually looking Connecticut looking like Stanford.

74
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,947
Rym: I don't want to take the Connecticut trains.

75
00:05:58,448 --> 00:05:59,351
Scott: rich people live there.

76
00:05:59,371 --> 00:06:02,320
Rym: Yeah, but those trains of Metro North notice how they're the least reliable.

77
00:06:03,901 --> 00:06:06,150
Scott: Well, that's because they have a lot of some of the.

78
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:08,420
Scott: a lot of the Connecticut trains use the overhead cables.

79
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,010
Rym: The catenaries are actually better.

80
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:15,407
Rym: the delays are due to other issues With like where the tracks are the catenary.

81
00:06:15,447 --> 00:06:16,932
Scott: the thing is the catenary trains.

82
00:06:17,213 --> 00:06:20,946
Scott: the layout of the interiors is far less efficient And they're less big.

83
00:06:21,267 --> 00:06:23,456
Scott: so there's a lot less seating, and there's more standing.

84
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:29,074
Scott: well except for but and this are it's impossible to get parking and it's money.

85
00:06:29,194 --> 00:06:30,959
Scott: when there is parking it's much more expensive.

86
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:36,220
Scott: and The only other thing about them is that those catenary trains have bark?

87
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,632
Rym: I was about to say they have the bars in the cars.

88
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:43,179
Rym: I mean when I take this right now It's like on the beacon train.

89
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,779
Scott: It's like you got to buy your alcohol and then get on the tree every

90
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:51,579
Rym: now And then I see someone like buying like five beers or like a bunch of wine and then getting on the train

91
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:57,161
Scott: Whereas in the Connecticut train that guy that is you know standing at the you know in the in the terminal There's

92
00:06:57,201 --> 00:06:57,904
Rym: just a bar.

93
00:06:58,266 --> 00:07:04,495
Rym: it'd be bad though because if I had a bar on the train I would pretty much hang out in that bar every day.

94
00:07:05,401 --> 00:07:06,284
Scott: That's a lot of people do.

95
00:07:06,505 --> 00:07:10,480
Scott: yeah, you know there's a. basically the seating in there is like these little circles.

96
00:07:10,923 --> 00:07:19,139
Scott: It's like you know sort of like a lounge And there's a little tiny table in the middle of the circley bit And then you know and you can also sit at the bar, and you can stand

97
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:35,880
Rym: Yep, so all that aside My other plan my other Horatio plan other than buying a house at the bottom of like the economic downturn Was to buy land and sit on it and pay it off because you can buy land really cheaply and then build my own.

98
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:41,989
Rym: Build my own goddamn mansion on it because I'm the goddamn Batman And you can't for it.

99
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,106
Scott: they no one's foreclosing on any dirt I know.

100
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:48,654
Rym: so I found this lot And it's basically remember when I first found out that you could climb out.

101
00:07:48,694 --> 00:07:49,879
Rym: beacon is all that stuff up there.

102
00:07:50,663 --> 00:07:53,600
Rym: When I first found that out is because I watered up this random trail.

103
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:58,960
Rym: The lot is basically the two acres in front of and including part of that trail.

104
00:07:59,802 --> 00:08:00,910
Rym: It's got FiOS.

105
00:08:01,253 --> 00:08:04,607
Rym: It's got electricity City water city sewer gas.

106
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:09,060
Scott: they ever have FiOS on the mountain, but they don't have FiOS over near the car dealers.

107
00:08:09,304 --> 00:08:09,835
Rym: They have it here.

108
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:10,038
Rym: now.

109
00:08:11,322 --> 00:08:12,473
Rym: If I was staying here, I'd get it.

110
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:13,883
Scott: well You're renting.

111
00:08:13,923 --> 00:08:18,491
Scott: so it's hard to get FiOS if you don't own it because that means that you install a bunch of shit And they might not.

112
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:24,220
Scott: you know I'm sure Mary wouldn't care, but I mean it's like yeah, but so I'm all excited.

113
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,020
Rym: I'm like you know what I'm just gonna do it or at least I'm gonna check it out.

114
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,960
Rym: So I get you know my realtor to check it all out and everything's good.

115
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,732
Rym: It's like this is exactly the perfect lot for your Rym.

116
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:34,100
Rym: You can build your mansion.

117
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:42,239
Rym: I got a builder to check it out, and they're like yeah This is perfect building you can have like a super big completely dry basement and everything the city was like.

118
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:43,226
Rym: yeah You can subdivide it.

119
00:08:43,246 --> 00:08:44,999
Rym: you could build an apartment building and a house.

120
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:46,500
Rym: So I'm like hot shit.

121
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,166
Rym: And it was only a hundred and fifty grand.

122
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:49,792
Rym: the taxes before you build something on.

123
00:08:49,832 --> 00:08:51,679
Rym: it was like a thousand dollars a year.

124
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:59,072
Scott: I would build a house And then I would build a garage a two-car garage And then I would build like a whole thing on top of the two-car garage.

125
00:08:59,092 --> 00:09:03,479
Scott: that was basically like a space of Awesomeness like just a one big room three house.

126
00:09:04,442 --> 00:09:05,067
Scott: No wouldn't have.

127
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,640
Scott: I wouldn't put like a kitchen or anything in there.

128
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,809
Scott: It'd just be one big room, and it would be like.

129
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,818
Scott: you know the special room like us you know.

130
00:09:11,562 --> 00:09:13,350
Rym: So I'm like all right.

131
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:17,670
Rym: pull the trigger get me like get me everything I need build a skywalk to it or something.

132
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,352
Rym: get me everything.

133
00:09:18,413 --> 00:09:23,106
Rym: I need to buy this land And I got word today.

134
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:27,980
Rym: She's like somebody already bought that land two weeks ago.

135
00:09:30,182 --> 00:09:37,114
Rym: So I looked at all the other land and all the other land Sucks, it's like 40 grand for a half-acre way.

136
00:09:37,134 --> 00:09:40,528
Rym: far away from the train station I found one.

137
00:09:40,568 --> 00:09:45,167
Rym: it was like 30 grand, and it was like a nice lot And it was near the train, and you know I couldn't buy it.

138
00:09:45,729 --> 00:09:53,480
Rym: There's a gigantic rock on the property like Too big and so it would have been so expensive to move that rock to build a house.

139
00:09:54,603 --> 00:09:57,500
Rym: You know how expensive it is to pay people to smash a rock you can't.

140
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,042
Scott: That would be badass.

141
00:09:58,062 --> 00:10:18,419
Rym: however that would cost like at six or seven hundred thousand dollars to build because why don't you build the house such that the rock is a structurally integral part of the house a Door fortress exactly yeah, so I might just fucking move into the city.

142
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,221
Rym: Like.

143
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:28,790
Scott: I'm like 15 minutes to work, but I got at the tray at the subway with Emily this morning Yeah, and it was you know one of those days with the subway.

144
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,240
Scott: Just like is like traffic something something Scott.

145
00:10:31,643 --> 00:10:33,939
Rym: It took me 31 minutes to get to work.

146
00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:38,811
Rym: It sucks Because I got to take the end down to the seven.

147
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:40,840
Rym: then I can get on the seven Express that goes right to Grand Central.

148
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:43,172
Scott: Well, yeah, you could you could do that.

149
00:10:43,192 --> 00:10:48,464
Rym: the thing is It's a lot faster.

150
00:10:48,485 --> 00:10:52,059
Rym: take the seven Express because seven Express goes by like every three minutes.

151
00:10:54,707 --> 00:10:55,939
Rym: There was almost no one on mine.

152
00:10:56,741 --> 00:10:58,754
Rym: Yeah, I had a seat the whole way.

153
00:10:58,794 --> 00:11:03,374
Rym: the only delay I really had was that I didn't realize I was at Grand Central on the seven.

154
00:11:03,394 --> 00:11:04,880
Rym: so I ended up taking it to Bryant Park.

155
00:11:05,781 --> 00:11:06,303
Rym: Oh, good.

156
00:11:06,384 --> 00:11:07,509
Rym: I was like what the fuck am I?

157
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:08,031
Rym: then I get out.

158
00:11:08,072 --> 00:11:08,855
Rym: I'm in Bryant Parks.

159
00:11:08,895 --> 00:11:16,820
Rym: I had to walk back across But then Basically most of my waiting was because I didn't look at the schedule of the end train.

160
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:21,055
Rym: So I just walked to the subway and I got there like as an end left side to wait.

161
00:11:21,095 --> 00:11:25,748
Rym: like that happens to me every Goddamn day I do it like 12 minutes for another end to come.

162
00:11:26,109 --> 00:11:27,493
Scott: as I'm walking to the subway.

163
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:33,500
Scott: every goddamn day one pulls up and I'm like just like well fuck and then I have to go and wait on the platform for the maximum possible.

164
00:11:33,881 --> 00:11:39,060
Rym: The worst thing in the world is when you're walking up to a subway and you hear the train like coming in.

165
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,209
Rym: You're like fuck fuck fuck.

166
00:11:40,229 --> 00:11:41,580
Rym: You're fumbling with your metro card.

167
00:11:41,861 --> 00:11:45,413
Rym: You're like like smash it into the sheen and bend it and you can't get in.

168
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:50,197
Rym: you're rushing and you always have to make That decision of do I run or do I just give the fuck up?

169
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,099
Scott: Because why am I in a hurry to get to work?

170
00:11:52,760 --> 00:12:01,079
Rym: You know That was my philosophy when I used to drive to the Bronx every day Like I'd see people speeding and I was like why the fuck would I ever speed on the way to work?

171
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,863
Rym: Speed on the way home.

172
00:12:03,103 --> 00:12:11,500
Rym: Yep, but like anytime the road was blocked which happened kind of frequently because of the you know, the Basically, the sawmill Parkway is like the second worst road in the world.

173
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:15,380
Rym: The thing is I would just like pull off to like a diner and eat breakfast.

174
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:16,978
Rym: I wouldn't even bother trying to get to work.

175
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:25,880
Scott: The thing is I think the phenomena of walking up to the subway and it pulls up and then you it's you're like damn it You can't get on it cuz you're just like it's 30 seconds too late.

176
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:31,880
Scott: Yeah, that phenomena is completely because these are you know above ground subways.

177
00:12:31,941 --> 00:12:34,200
Scott: They're up, you know elevated rail tracks.

178
00:12:34,742 --> 00:12:40,040
Scott: If the subway was underground you wouldn't see that it was coming into the station until you're already down there.

179
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:42,100
Scott: So you wouldn't even know if it like it's train.

180
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:44,326
Scott: Yeah Like seconds before you got down.

181
00:12:44,386 --> 00:12:56,159
Rym: but at the same time like in Grand Central for example many times I'll like be walking like toward that stairway down to the six and I'll hear it coming in and it's like Well, how do you know that's not a four or five?

182
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,560
Rym: Well, the thing is whatever one I want I hear one coming in.

183
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,292
Rym: So then there's a decision of I have to think do I run?

184
00:13:01,312 --> 00:13:03,060
Rym: is that the train I want?

185
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,707
Scott: I basically never run.

186
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:06,160
Rym: and then you'd like you've got it.

187
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,885
Rym: You can kind of peek your head around as you're walking down the stairs and you see like, ah, it's the four I wanted.

188
00:13:10,946 --> 00:13:11,734
Rym: doors are closing.

189
00:13:11,936 --> 00:13:15,330
Rym: fuck Here comes the six gonna take forever.

190
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,016
Scott: I just never run.

191
00:13:17,317 --> 00:13:18,200
Scott: I don't care anymore.

192
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:24,780
Scott: Yeah, even if I lose what 15 minutes, that's nothing compared to what I lost in Beacon.

193
00:13:24,961 --> 00:13:26,086
Scott: So it's like oh shit.

194
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:29,340
Rym: Yeah, the only thing is I can't listen to 15 minutes of a podcast.

195
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,340
Scott: I can watch a whole TED talk while I'm on the platform.

196
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,840
Rym: I'll have to read more and watch more like portable media.

197
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:39,076
Rym: But I can't really use the laptop or do anything intensive on the commute because it's so you can.

198
00:13:39,217 --> 00:13:40,240
Scott: you can read a book or you?

199
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,455
Scott: Can listen to something you can watch a video on the iPhone and not cuz it's so short.

200
00:13:43,495 --> 00:13:44,400
Rym: It's really not that short.

201
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,180
Rym: It's because there are like multiple interruptions along the way.

202
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,679
Rym: It's like a walk gotta sit gotta walk again sit again walk again sit again walk and then I'm at work.

203
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:57,500
Scott: Yep, and you also even if you're standing on the subway, you got to dodge people dodge people dodge people.

204
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,351
Scott: Yep, better try to get on and off the train.

205
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:00,773
Rym: So we'll see.

206
00:14:01,335 --> 00:14:02,640
Rym: maybe I'll just move into your building.

207
00:14:02,721 --> 00:14:03,920
Rym: I'm gonna start looking at apartments.

208
00:14:05,181 --> 00:14:06,447
Scott: There's other buildings are out here.

209
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:08,155
Scott: There's actually a big big building.

210
00:14:08,175 --> 00:14:09,140
Scott: That's real fancy looking.

211
00:14:09,622 --> 00:14:11,290
Scott: They're still building it across the street.

212
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,214
Scott: You could just wait for it.

213
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:18,836
Rym: Yeah, I might But the only fancy the big thing I got to do now is my original plan was I got all?

214
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:19,840
Rym: we got all this furniture.

215
00:14:20,243 --> 00:14:24,552
Rym: We're kind of just like deferring decisions because if I bought a house I would just buy like my half of all of it.

216
00:14:24,612 --> 00:14:25,840
Rym: cuz you know house needs furniture.

217
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:26,882
Rym: I don't.

218
00:14:26,902 --> 00:14:31,960
Rym: we're gonna do with that gigantic ass kitchen table and like all that like my gigantic wine cabinet.

219
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,654
Rym: I'm not bringing that to an apartment in the city.

220
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:41,105
Rym: That bed will fit.

221
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,033
Rym: I mean, it's a queen-size bed the same size.

222
00:14:43,113 --> 00:14:43,756
Scott: Oh my bed.

223
00:14:43,776 --> 00:14:47,085
Rym: Oh, yeah Give it to someone.

224
00:14:47,105 --> 00:14:47,507
Rym: I don't know.

225
00:14:47,828 --> 00:14:48,572
Rym: Maybe I'll ever get it.

226
00:14:48,592 --> 00:14:49,255
Scott: We have to sell.

227
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:49,677
Scott: I think.

228
00:14:49,918 --> 00:14:54,435
Rym: well first We might have to have a front row crew who wants our shit party.

229
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:58,603
Scott: Yeah Something actually a lot of this stuff I'm just gonna.

230
00:14:58,845 --> 00:15:01,300
Scott: I think we should put out on the lawn and beacon and be like free.

231
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:03,710
Rym: Actually, you go in a knot and all them might.

232
00:15:04,031 --> 00:15:06,476
Rym: they might be able to use your little bed because they got a lot extra space.

233
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,024
Scott: They want it.

234
00:15:08,225 --> 00:15:10,437
Rym: maybe I'll see if they want it, I don't know.

235
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:11,000
Rym: we'll figure it out.

236
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:12,959
Rym: We also got to figure out what to do for you.

237
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,619
Scott: It's not free, but I kind of need money.

238
00:15:15,142 --> 00:15:18,680
Rym: This would be the first year in a long time that I have not been the host of the New Year's party.

239
00:15:20,441 --> 00:15:20,702
Rym: I've got.

240
00:15:20,743 --> 00:15:24,460
Rym: I have to nominate someone to carry on the tradition at least for one year until we figure out.

241
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:27,487
Rym: I'm thinking with money next like next next year.

242
00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:30,437
Rym: We should just rent like a fucking ballroom or something in the city.

243
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:34,547
Scott: Yeah So speaking of in the city, right.

244
00:15:34,688 --> 00:15:43,653
Rym: so in the summer in the city in the summer in the city More and more of my house shit is taken care of.

245
00:15:43,673 --> 00:15:46,560
Scott: so I'm gonna start doing some city stuff that I could not do before.

246
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:53,420
Scott: Yeah, so so boxy announced today that they're finally making a boxy box a piece of hard.

247
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,563
Rym: We were like the Roku.

248
00:15:55,084 --> 00:16:01,983
Scott: Yes, so there is gonna be some sort of release launch something something in Brooklyn, December Something.

250
00:16:04,854 --> 00:16:06,280
Scott: So I RSVP'd for it.

251
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:12,736
Scott: so I'm gonna go check it out and Hopefully get one because I think if I had one of those I don't need to buy a Mac Mini.

252
00:16:12,756 --> 00:16:19,011
Scott: and if it's really cheap Like a hundred bucks, even if it's 200 bucks It's like well no need to buy a $600 Mac Mini.

253
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:20,678
Scott: a boxy box does everything I need.

254
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:23,510
Rym: Yeah Oh, you know else we can voice stuff off on.

255
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,140
Rym: if they're willing to drive to this old house is the listeners.

256
00:16:27,262 --> 00:16:29,980
Rym: I know a lot of you listeners are poor like punk college kids.

257
00:16:31,061 --> 00:16:39,710
Scott: We can sell you anyone needs like beds or a desk that consists of cinder blocks and a piece of wood or a TV An old dresser.

258
00:16:40,092 --> 00:16:41,840
Rym: I remember when you bought that cinder block thing.

259
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,380
Rym: Like you think like the cinder block desk is the cheapest cheapest option.

260
00:16:45,822 --> 00:16:50,061
Rym: It was actually slightly expensive for because you got the nice cinder blocks and the nice piece of wood I got.

261
00:16:50,222 --> 00:16:55,239
Scott: I got like six nice cinder blocks and like a big nice piece of wood and then I had to like.

262
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:00,537
Rym: I Sanded and stained the piece of wood and it was not that much cheaper than the desk.

263
00:17:00,677 --> 00:17:01,400
Rym: I just bought.

264
00:17:02,141 --> 00:17:06,499
Rym: However, it was actually a lot nicer in the end because I bought the shittiest fucking desk.

265
00:17:07,122 --> 00:17:08,548
Scott: Yeah, remember that desk at RIT?

266
00:17:08,588 --> 00:17:11,300
Rym: We tried to move it and the top just like fell off and cracked into.

267
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,539
Scott: Well that remember the desk that I bought at RIT.

268
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:17,505
Rym: That thing was.

269
00:17:17,545 --> 00:17:18,849
Rym: that thing was legendary.

270
00:17:19,332 --> 00:17:21,040
Scott: this new IKEA desk though is pretty good.

271
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:26,119
Scott: It's about the same size as the cinder block desk only no cinder blocks and it's got this nice rolling file.

272
00:17:26,882 --> 00:17:27,548
Scott: That's pretty good.

273
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:35,861
Rym: Yes, though Even if I don't live in the same building if I live in the area You know all the concerns the listeners had of like oh shit and all the stuff I was planning like I was trying to figure Out.

274
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,450
Scott: there are other areas too.

275
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,239
Scott: Don't just limit to yourself to where I am.

276
00:17:39,862 --> 00:17:40,444
Rym: I know I'm.

277
00:17:40,504 --> 00:17:44,580
Rym: actually I found some places in Midtown that I'm looking at and some places on like Park Avenue.

278
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,293
Rym: Yeah, I'd love to live on Park Avenue.

279
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,380
Rym: across from Central Park.

280
00:17:48,882 --> 00:17:52,580
Scott: There are some places like big apartment buildings a little bit west of my office.

281
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:57,057
Scott: I could point, you know, like they all have banners hanging on the side saying move in here.

282
00:17:57,178 --> 00:17:57,740
Scott: call this number.

283
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:04,560
Rym: The other thing that makes it more complicated is that I don't get my raise until like next month.

284
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,767
Rym: So, I don't know how much I'm getting.

285
00:18:05,787 --> 00:18:07,920
Rym: I mean, I'm gonna I gotta get at least like five percent.

286
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,832
Scott: I don't know if or what I'm getting but they actually I just got the form.

287
00:18:11,872 --> 00:18:13,417
Scott: That's like the self-assessment form.

288
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:18,892
Rym: I'm like, oh shit About pretty much if I get I calculated if I get a 15% raise or more I can afford.

289
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:22,579
Rym: like luxury.

290
00:18:23,662 --> 00:18:24,465
Scott: You can already this.

291
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:26,271
Scott: what I'm in is considered luxury.

292
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:28,500
Rym: I'm talking like luxury luxury.

293
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:30,748
Rym: It's weird, you know luxury not just considered.

294
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:33,740
Rym: Yeah, like, you know all you non New Yorkers and I didn't realize this.

295
00:18:33,981 --> 00:18:39,580
Rym: You know how like you see in New York or whatever they'll say like in the Bronx luxury apartment versus normal apartment.

296
00:18:40,242 --> 00:18:41,445
Rym: It's not like the rest of the world.

297
00:18:41,726 --> 00:18:46,699
Rym: normal apartment means there's no wall the ceiling leaks and there's a body in it.

298
00:18:47,261 --> 00:18:49,246
Rym: Luxury means normal apartment.

299
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:52,233
Scott: Yes luxury means it's modern.

300
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:53,998
Scott: It has new things.

301
00:18:54,158 --> 00:18:54,740
Scott: It's clean.

302
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,823
Scott: There aren't rats.

303
00:18:55,903 --> 00:18:56,906
Scott: That's what luxury means.

304
00:18:56,966 --> 00:19:06,355
Rym: Yep, and beyond that there's basically decadent like living in like down down Not downtown, but like in those people live or like to do city called a palace.

305
00:19:06,616 --> 00:19:07,479
Rym: I look into the city.

306
00:19:08,385 --> 00:19:21,275
Scott: If down in the financial district, you know There's a whole bunch of like ultra fancy apartments that are actually relatively cheap because people don't actually live down there Because it's actually really boring, but there's big big buildings with fancy fancy apartments.

307
00:19:21,396 --> 00:19:22,900
Rym: Yeah, my community be real easy.

308
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,835
Rym: I take the four to Grand Central.

309
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:25,279
Rym: I'm at work

310
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,975
Scott: Yeah, and you know, but you would you know, you could say

311
00:19:29,015 --> 00:19:47,757
Rym: I live on Wall Street But I work for Wall Street, but not on Wall Street Yep, but mostly it's that if we're both living in the city all the stuff I was we're putting together to do the show better with Skype in and like recording ahead on weekends This is the show like fucking normal again.

312
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,439
Rym: But anyway things of the day, it's Thursday.

313
00:19:57,499 --> 00:20:01,170
Rym: It's fast and loose GeekNights for the karate fast gentleman.

314
00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:04,196
Rym: No, this is what we'll see.

315
00:20:04,216 --> 00:20:05,260
Rym: how much actually.

316
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,330
Scott: I got one more thing to say that we should have included in the previous bit.

317
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:12,025
Scott: You were all talking like oh you should do the Horatio thing.

318
00:20:12,065 --> 00:20:13,210
Scott: Just go for it, right?

319
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,439
Scott: Yeah, you know what the Horatio thing to do is.

320
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,695
Rym: Just run away to Europe.

321
00:20:20,518 --> 00:20:22,184
Rym: no, what's the ratio thing?

322
00:20:22,907 --> 00:20:29,070
Rym: more literally the Get a houseboat and just like.

323
00:20:34,491 --> 00:20:40,317
Rym: And normally in a show like that or in a book like that you expect him in the sea to be like, all right I'm at war at the sea.

324
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:41,784
Rym: I can't wait for the war to end.

325
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,190
Rym: Horatio was like man.

326
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,739
Rym: The sea is great land sucks.

327
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:45,725
Rym: I don't ever want to go back.

328
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:51,321
Rym: Fuck the land Like when the wars and he's like yes the war ended.

329
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:53,710
Rym: ah shit, I gotta go back home to my wife.

330
00:20:54,154 --> 00:20:54,458
Rym: Oh good.

331
00:20:54,498 --> 00:20:55,469
Rym: She died of smallpox.

332
00:21:02,612 --> 00:21:05,866
Rym: But the ratio thing was like buying land right now would have been a Horatio thing.

333
00:21:05,906 --> 00:21:10,585
Rym: if I can't buy land Then the next ratio thing is just fucking move to the city and throw away all my shit.

334
00:21:10,926 --> 00:21:11,930
Scott: Why don't you do the free yacht?

335
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,262
Rym: Because I don't know enough about yachts to deal with the free yacht.

336
00:21:16,563 --> 00:21:18,270
Rym: There's another free yacht problem get this.

337
00:21:18,753 --> 00:21:20,867
Rym: Do you know how many yachts there are for sale in?

338
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:27,010
Rym: Parts of the world where basically people can't get their yachts out because the only real way out is past Somalia.

339
00:21:29,392 --> 00:21:32,389
Rym: There are luxury yachts like queuing up that can't go past.

340
00:21:36,173 --> 00:21:38,889
Rym: Very few ships can deal with that sort of thing.

341
00:21:39,813 --> 00:21:42,443
Scott: So if your boat isn't good enough you just you won't make it through the rough.

342
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:44,390
Rym: yeah very few people have boats.

343
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:45,072
Rym: Yeah, we'll see.

344
00:21:45,092 --> 00:21:45,674
Rym: I was thinking about.

345
00:21:45,714 --> 00:21:53,498
Rym: you know I'm not a sailor.

346
00:21:53,518 --> 00:21:55,490
Rym: We'll have to ask one of our more adventurous listening.

347
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,489
Rym: You've never been to the West Indies.

348
00:22:03,813 --> 00:22:11,430
Rym: Let me tell you Oh Oh Captain laudanum, but anyway things of the day.

349
00:22:12,055 --> 00:22:20,071
Rym: This was pointed out on the forum and then it also appeared on FARC and I have to talk about this kid because this kid is So.

350
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:26,475
Rym: so like this guy gets it this kid is gonna grow up to be if not exactly Like us.

351
00:22:26,977 --> 00:22:29,346
Rym: he is going to be awesome great things.

352
00:22:29,366 --> 00:22:32,662
Rym: They're gonna come out of this game Because he's doing the same kind of shit.

353
00:22:32,762 --> 00:22:37,288
Rym: I used to pull in high school But now there's an internet to where everyone's gonna find out about it.

354
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:42,101
Rym: Basically This kid is 10 years old.

355
00:22:42,162 --> 00:22:43,470
Rym: His name is Will Phillips.

356
00:22:44,511 --> 00:22:49,970
Rym: He's the caption on his picture on this article says Will Phillips freedom lover.

357
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,378
Rym: And it's not just that he's smart and cool.

358
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,149
Rym: his parents are equally smart and cool, which is the rare thing.

359
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:02,121
Scott: You don't get a smart and cool person from non smart cool parents.

360
00:23:02,241 --> 00:23:09,050
Rym: occasionally you do but then I said that often Yep, and sometimes you get the kid who's not so smart and cool, but the parents are cool.

361
00:23:09,191 --> 00:23:11,769
Rym: But this is the rare confluence of both.

362
00:23:12,473 --> 00:23:15,709
Rym: Also given the situation to prove to the world that they are the way they are.

363
00:23:16,273 --> 00:23:25,695
Rym: And this whole thing just reeks of that scene and Donnie Darko when the parents get called the principal's office and the principal explains what Donnie Darko did and dad's like Really?

364
00:23:25,957 --> 00:23:26,562
Rym: That's what he did.

365
00:23:26,966 --> 00:23:27,470
Rym: That's awesome.

366
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:33,730
Rym: Basically the kid is smart, which apparently is a big deal.

367
00:23:37,934 --> 00:23:49,409
Scott: I just want to say this whole story by the way is is just more Fire more wood on the fire for why we should separate people based on smartness in school more.

368
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:52,369
Rym: beyond that I want this to be a movement and I'm now.

369
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:56,163
Rym: I'm basically not gonna stand up for the pledge ever if ever.

370
00:23:56,203 --> 00:24:04,637
Rym: I'm in a situation where I should stand up for the pledge until gays can get married Because that's kind of what this kid is doing.

371
00:24:04,678 --> 00:24:10,750
Rym: basically, you know the whole story you can read the article He decided not to stand up for the pledge anymore.

372
00:24:12,992 --> 00:24:17,849
Rym: Well, I always stood up for the national anthem, but I didn't sing it or put my hand on my heart in protest of the war.

373
00:24:18,473 --> 00:24:20,765
Scott: Yeah, that's what I always did is I was just stood up, but I didn't.

374
00:24:20,785 --> 00:24:26,395
Rym: yeah Cuz you gotta do you gotta do the half, you know Put forth the gesture of like.

375
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:30,729
Rym: I agree with everything that song stands for but my country is not living up to it.

376
00:24:31,372 --> 00:24:32,840
Rym: Yeah, so I got to go halfway.

377
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,690
Scott: That's what I do on the national anthem.

378
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:37,004
Scott: That's what I've been doing on the national anthem for like decades.

379
00:24:37,165 --> 00:24:48,490
Rym: Anyway, yeah so but basically this kid was like I'm not gonna stand up for the pledge anymore because Gay people aren't you know, no, there's no freedom and justice for all if gay people don't have freedom and justice.

380
00:24:49,171 --> 00:25:04,223
Rym: Yeah, and this is one of many times this kid has apparently taken a reasonable stand and basically the teachers and all the people around him acted like the way you expect and the kid Basically responded the way smart people do.

381
00:25:04,243 --> 00:25:05,550
Rym: he's like everyone around me stupid.

382
00:25:06,292 --> 00:25:07,997
Rym: Everyone around me is loud and there's.

383
00:25:08,178 --> 00:25:11,568
Rym: they're overreacting and they're acting with their emotions, but I'm not backing down.

384
00:25:11,608 --> 00:25:14,597
Rym: no matter what You should read this story.

385
00:25:14,637 --> 00:25:17,129
Rym: It warms every cockle that is in my heart.

386
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,479
Scott: We need to just go around the country and we should.

387
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,890
Scott: it's easy to detect kids like this if you're smart.

388
00:25:23,052 --> 00:25:23,275
Rym: I got.

389
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:23,823

00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,617
Rym: He's referring to the teacher.

392
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:27,549
Rym: that was like freaking out and yelling at him.

393
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:32,509
Rym: Quotes and then quoting again because I'm quoting the kid and I'm quoting the article.

Scott: Oh Shit.

420
00:26:53,639 --> 00:26:56,910

421
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,257
Scott: Fuck this kid and his parents.

422

Rym: That's my thing of the day.

424
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:12,849
Rym: Will Phillips if you find this podcast for whatever reason you're a goddamn hero in my book.

425
00:27:13,811 --> 00:27:18,495
Scott: Yeah, so if you're that if you don't like this kind of kid, you're not Even better.

426
00:27:18,515 --> 00:27:19,743
Rym: There's a picture of this thing.

427
00:27:19,864 --> 00:27:20,669
Rym: There's a picture of him.

428
00:27:21,011 --> 00:27:26,108
Rym: I'll bet he looks exactly like so many the kids that like the summer camps with all the geeky shit you used to go to.

429
00:27:27,071 --> 00:27:28,575
Rym: Maybe he's like this geeky little kid.

430
00:27:29,337 --> 00:27:31,884
Scott: Yeah, so I got new TV.

431
00:27:31,904 --> 00:27:34,030
Scott: All right, cuz the episodes gonna be our couches, right?

432
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:37,074
Rym: Yes Yeah, sure.

433
00:27:37,718 --> 00:27:38,805
Scott: Okay, so I got.

434
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:39,610
Scott: the other thing was a TV.

435
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,401
Scott: I guess I don't do an episode on TVs.

436
00:27:41,442 --> 00:27:42,710
Scott: That would be kind of silly.

437
00:27:43,032 --> 00:27:45,163
Rym: Well, it'd be tough because I'm not up on the technology.

438
00:27:45,183 --> 00:27:46,169
Rym: I have to do research again.

439
00:27:47,471 --> 00:27:47,725
Scott: Anyway.

440
00:27:49,831 --> 00:27:55,334
Scott: But one thing that I knew is that you know, basically when everyone knows this at least I hope you know Everybody knows it.

441
00:27:56,057 --> 00:27:57,041
Rym: Yeah, everybody knows.

442
00:27:57,061 --> 00:28:07,910
Scott: Yes, when you go to Best Buy or something All the TVs are set on vivid mode or Store demo mode, which is basically all the colors are super saturated and like everything just kind of looks.

443
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:13,189
Scott: Yeah, basically what they do is they change they crank the contrast and the brightness and the saturation way up.

444
00:28:13,571 --> 00:28:22,448
Scott: That's why like when you go to the store all the TVs are like, whoa, that's amazing You know because it's just like the colors just like ah The thing is right.

445
00:28:23,297 --> 00:28:31,054
Scott: While it looks amazing psychologically speaking if you actually watch TV like that with those settings on all the time a It'll hurt your eyes.

446
00:28:31,215 --> 00:28:36,894
Scott: It's kind of not comfortable and to the colors are just wrong Like, you know.

447
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:42,090
Scott: and the thing is, you know, you might not realize the colors are wrong, but they are so wrong wrong wrong.

448
00:28:42,311 --> 00:28:43,755
Scott: So I was trying.

449
00:28:43,836 --> 00:29:04,770
Scott: I knew this right and I so of course when I went to the store to look at TVs I switched them to normal mode instead of vivid mode, but that's not really enough, you know it's like you have to calibrate to get the actual correct colors on a display whether it's a monitor or a television and To do this you need like some test patterns and some instructions and all these sorts of things.

450
00:29:05,273 --> 00:29:11,164
Scott: You know, the only way to do it perfectly is with expensive equipment But you could do it 90% perfectly with just some test patterns.

451
00:29:11,727 --> 00:29:12,410
Scott: So I went online.

452
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:17,250
Scott: I was trying to find some test pattern discs to help me out and all of them apparently suck.

453
00:29:17,892 --> 00:29:19,557
Scott: So it's like and they were expensive too.

454
00:29:19,577 --> 00:29:20,701
Scott: They're like 20 30 bucks.

455
00:29:20,741 --> 00:29:21,845
Scott: I'm like fuck that, right?

456
00:29:22,447 --> 00:29:23,490
Scott: So I didn't even bother.

457
00:29:23,611 --> 00:29:28,170
Scott: I just put my TV in normal mode and let it be that way and I'll calibrate it if I have to later.

458
00:29:28,271 --> 00:29:28,513
Scott: I don't.

459
00:29:28,836 --> 00:29:29,582
Scott: it's too much effort.

460
00:29:30,066 --> 00:29:30,490
Scott: regardless.

461
00:29:31,052 --> 00:29:43,910
Scott: I found this awesome thread on the high def forum, right and what they have here are pictures of Uncalibrated TVs and Calibrated TVs side by side, right?

462
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:52,933
Scott: So it's like you look at one picture and it's an uncalibrated TV and you're like, oh that looks alright, you know It's a high-definition picture Lots of bright colors.

463
00:29:53,675 --> 00:30:01,944
Scott: and then you look at the calibrated TV and then you compare the two at the same time and you're like Oh my god, how come in the calibrated one?

464
00:30:02,024 --> 00:30:02,567
Scott: It's not white.

465
00:30:02,627 --> 00:30:03,069
Scott: It's blue.

466
00:30:04,313 --> 00:30:06,590
Scott: You know, the difference is just like oh shit.

467
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:10,944
Scott: So if you are one of those cuz someone on Twitter was like skeptical.

468
00:30:10,964 --> 00:30:14,355
Scott: they were like, yeah those Calibration just don't do shit.

469
00:30:14,456 --> 00:30:17,886
Scott: and I was like, uh, no, actually they really do do something.

470
00:30:17,946 --> 00:30:20,331
Scott: They're sort of necessary You're?

471
00:30:20,391 --> 00:30:21,414
Scott: you don't know you're talking about.

472
00:30:22,096 --> 00:30:23,018
Scott: so here is the proof.

473
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:28,815
Scott: if you do not believe that your TV has the quote wrong colors Coming out of it.

474
00:30:29,317 --> 00:30:32,770
Scott: Then you need to look at all of the awesome pictures in this thread.

475
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,094
Scott: It's actually really long and like.

476
00:30:34,114 --> 00:30:37,445
Scott: there's a lot of people, you know, calibrating different TVs.

477
00:30:37,465 --> 00:30:44,665
Scott: There's like five pages worth of You know posts and images and also it's pretty good and it's it's fun to look at.

478
00:30:44,725 --> 00:30:48,222
Scott: also like yeah different things here Ah crap, you know what?

479
00:30:48,242 --> 00:30:51,759
Rym: I didn't take into account New York City income tax.

480
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:54,870
Rym: I'll have to pay an extra four grand a year in taxes.

481
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:57,139
Scott: Yeah, I'm paying the extra.

482
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:58,806
Rym: That's all four grand.

483
00:30:58,886 --> 00:30:59,670
Rym: It's a lot of money.

484
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:01,708
Scott: Yeah, it's it's monies.

485
00:31:02,911 --> 00:31:07,350
Rym: It's like fifteen hundred dollars plus three point two percent of all the money over fifty grand.

486
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:10,301
Scott: Yes, something like that, huh?

487
00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:14,917
Scott: Oh well Yep, it's the cost of living.

488
00:31:15,197 --> 00:31:17,023
Rym: Well, I refuse to live in Jersey.

489
00:31:17,123 --> 00:31:18,567
Scott: So yeah, there's.

490
00:31:18,608 --> 00:31:19,370
Rym: no I'm living there.

491
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:22,837
Rym: Oh my god, one of my co-workers even like yeah Why don't you just move to Jersey?

492
00:31:22,857 --> 00:31:24,166
Rym: and I was like, do you like living in Jersey?

493
00:31:24,187 --> 00:31:31,959
Rym: and he was like You know Jersey's not so bad Bergen debacle fuck you Bergen.

494
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:38,099
Rym: if you're gonna commute to New York like Bergen is the county, you know If I was in Bergen, I would do something very specific.

495
00:31:38,721 --> 00:31:41,570
Rym: I would work from home one day, right?

496
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,742
Rym: Sunday for a New York company.

497
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:46,090
Rym: now, it's interstate commerce.

498
00:31:46,431 --> 00:31:47,375
Rym: Then I would sue.

499
00:31:47,395 --> 00:31:54,124
Rym: I would email the city or send them a certified letter saying I work to this day Bring charges against me and then when they did I'd sue him.

500
00:31:54,165 --> 00:31:54,909
Rym: interstate commerce.

501
00:31:56,034 --> 00:31:59,641
Scott: Yeah It'd be interesting but I pointed out I would just.

502
00:31:59,661 --> 00:32:01,370
Scott: I would just do straight-up defiance.

503
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:03,089
Scott: I would open a store and open it up.

504
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:08,970
Rym: I pointed out something even better because in my department everyone other than my boss lives in Jersey in that County.

505
00:32:10,872 --> 00:32:14,890
Rym: You know once a week like every now and then one of us is on support and if we get paged we have to work.

506
00:32:15,731 --> 00:32:17,920
Rym: It is illegal for them to work on Sunday.

507
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:19,346
Scott: You looked at the law.

508
00:32:19,386 --> 00:32:29,456
Rym: Yeah Yeah If you live in Paramus, especially uh-huh, so I don't know.

509
00:32:29,576 --> 00:32:29,918

510
00:32:29,938 --> 00:32:32,392
Rym: how did I told them they should take it to our boss and be like, yeah I can't.

511
00:32:32,653 --> 00:32:34,544
Rym: I can't respond to pages on Sundays.

512
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:36,594
Scott: Sorry law Yeah, that would be interesting.

513
00:32:36,614 --> 00:32:47,950
Scott: cuz right instead of you know them the employees suing what they should do is they should just be like Sorry, I can't respond to pages on Sundays, right and then at your company will do something about it.

514
00:32:48,131 --> 00:32:52,188
Scott: Hey our employees who happen to live in your town are technically not allowed to.

515
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:55,181

516
00:32:55,281 --> 00:33:05,854
Scott: We're coming after you, you know They would probably just all that would happen is they would pass an exception in the county, you know legislation Anyway, huh?

517
00:33:05,954 --> 00:33:10,810
Rym: But then yeah, I'm sure you could use that exception to do awesome stuff like sell things.

518
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,096
Scott: He's the IKEA open.

519
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:12,277
Scott: Yeah.

520
00:33:12,378 --> 00:33:17,755
Rym: Anyway, anyway, so the metamucil Couchy oh You keep for every time.

521
00:33:17,775 --> 00:33:18,678
Rym: that's why I say metamucil?

522
00:33:18,698 --> 00:33:19,501
Rym: because yeah, I think you need it.

00:33:20,002 --> 00:33:20,945
Scott: So metamin it.

524
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:25,522
Scott: I Was actually looking at some fiber pills in the store the other day.

525
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:27,370
Rym: Are you having some some pooping troubles?

526
00:33:30,255 --> 00:33:32,330
Rym: No one just looks at fiber supplements.

527
00:33:33,271 --> 00:33:35,625
Rym: No, it's just like I'm gonna look at some fiber supplements.

528
00:33:35,645 --> 00:33:36,489
Rym: That's a fun thing to do.

529
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:41,910
Rym: They think either I haven't pooped in a long time or I pooped way too frequently.

530
00:33:45,132 --> 00:33:46,862
Scott: The kind that you have the powder.

531
00:33:46,882 --> 00:33:47,666
Scott: I don't want to do.

532
00:33:47,686 --> 00:33:49,254
Scott: that's nasty I don't do that, right.

533
00:33:49,716 --> 00:33:55,738
Scott: so it's looking to be pill related ones, right and I'm looking and it's like okay pills.

534
00:33:55,858 --> 00:33:57,042
Scott: It's like 15 bucks.

535
00:33:57,122 --> 00:33:59,691
Scott: You get a whole bottle full of pills like a hundred or so Right.

536
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,579
Scott: Yeah, so I look at the instructions, you know what the instructions say.

537
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,642
Rym: What do they say?

538
00:34:04,364 --> 00:34:05,848
Scott: take six pills a day?

539
00:34:07,974 --> 00:34:10,569
Scott: And you know how much fiber that is not enough.

540
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:15,683
Rym: How many I guess how much I'm gonna go with 70% of your daily recommended dose.

541
00:34:15,824 --> 00:34:16,987
Scott: how many how many grams?

542
00:34:17,487 --> 00:34:18,050
Rym: I don't know.

543
00:34:18,773 --> 00:34:25,437
Rym: You wouldn't ask unless it was really high or really low a million For what four grams?

544
00:34:26,018 --> 00:34:29,449
Scott: four grams is how much I could get with like two pieces of bread.

545
00:34:31,271 --> 00:34:37,570
Scott: So it's like I'll just use a different bread that has fibers in it and fuck this frickin, you know, wow.

546
00:34:38,831 --> 00:34:39,774
Rym: So anyway met a minute.

547
00:34:40,114 --> 00:34:50,268
Rym: the details will be forthcoming but we can at least tell you guys all now I Have officially gotten a license to run a TEDx.

548
00:34:53,074 --> 00:35:01,750
Rym: So we are going to be running a TEDx in Connecticut and In the summer, there will be many more details to come.

549
00:35:02,192 --> 00:35:09,770
Rym: I have to clear the press release with the TED Organization before I issue a press release and get all the details, but we're gonna run it.

550
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:14,649
Rym: We're basically we're only going to invite the members of Connecticut for the first of these TEDx's.

551
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:19,723
Scott: So you should become a member of Connecticut and then you will get an invite to TEDx.

552
00:35:19,843 --> 00:35:26,970
Rym: Yes, and if this goes well, ah You can foresee many more TEDx's run by myself and Scott.

553
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:29,438
Rym: If this goes poorly, I don't know.

554
00:35:29,498 --> 00:35:30,804
Rym: Maybe the TED organization will shoot us.

555
00:35:30,885 --> 00:35:31,568
Rym: I don't know how it works.

556
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,014
Scott: What's the worst case?

557
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:38,990
Rym: the worst case scenario is I commit seppuku and shame because I've sullied the TED name.

558
00:35:39,832 --> 00:35:41,049
Scott: No, but I mean can they like sue us?

559
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:46,265
Rym: Basically, if we screw it up, they will not give us future licenses for TEDx's.

560
00:35:46,948 --> 00:35:47,389
Scott: but that's it.

561
00:35:48,232 --> 00:35:49,175
Rym: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

562
00:35:49,697 --> 00:35:50,058
Rym: That's fine.

563
00:35:50,138 --> 00:35:53,529
Rym: Unless we defame them or libel them or slander them.

564
00:35:55,251 --> 00:35:56,254
Scott: Yeah, we will.

565
00:35:56,455 --> 00:35:58,181
Scott: we will libel them with false praise.

566
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:58,542
Rym: Yes.

567
00:35:58,642 --> 00:36:00,910

Scott: So couches Yeah, I mean So I just bought this couch from Ikea.

599
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:53,450
Rym: It's a really nice couch.

600
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:57,929
Rym: It's like super modern design like the nice stylish low couch with the chase on the side of it.

601
00:37:58,692 --> 00:38:00,081
Scott: It's basically what it is, right?

602
00:38:00,121 --> 00:38:05,810
Scott: It's an l-shaped catch But it's not an l-shaped like the curved ones where someone's gonna sit sideways.

603
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:10,327
Scott: I mean you could you know, but basically everyone's supposed to you know, three seats.

604
00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:13,758
Scott: everyone sits forward But the rightmost seat is long.

605
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:15,725
Scott: So you basically you don't even have an ottoman.

606
00:38:15,765 --> 00:38:17,330
Scott: It's just basically a long seat.

607
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,015
Scott: You just lay down.

608
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:19,950
Scott: It's like a little you know chase.

609
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:27,445
Scott: So the right seat is long and the left seats are just normal seats and then you know There's three cushions and it's nice and square, right?

610
00:38:28,812 --> 00:38:35,050
Scott: It's this dark gray color Which is you know, it's good because most every all the other furniture of the room is black.

611
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,530
Rym: Well, the cool thing about it was that it's also a queen-size bed.

612
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,680
Rym: But you know, we're hanging out at Scott's apartment.

613
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,987
Scott: It's queen size or you think it's full size.

614
00:38:41,047 --> 00:38:41,590
Scott: It's queen size.

615
00:38:41,996 --> 00:38:52,710
Rym: It's queen size Alright, but the thing is we were laying on it right or sitting on it and I'm looking at I'm trying to figure out like I expected it to unfold in a certain way to become the bed.

616
00:38:53,352 --> 00:38:58,290
Rym: The way it unfolded was not at all what I expected but was in retrospect a much smarter way to do it.

617
00:38:58,872 --> 00:39:09,610
Scott: Yeah, basically the you know, it's an L shape so you have to fill in that area You know in the middle of the L to make a square so you pull out basically underneath the non L part.

618
00:39:10,292 --> 00:39:15,049
Scott: You know, basically it's basically a love seat with like a law or the chase attached to it at the hip, right?

619
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:16,912
Scott: Underneath the love seat.

620
00:39:16,932 --> 00:39:22,080
Scott: You just pull this box straight out and then it goes straight up and that's it.

621
00:39:24,736 --> 00:39:27,976
Rym: Tada, tada You don't have to unfold anything.

622
00:39:28,036 --> 00:39:34,378
Scott: it just comes out and up and then goes down and in that's it and it's pretty s. Actually, it's pretty nice because there is sort.

623
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:40,750
Scott: there isn't really an under-the-couch situation So much so you can't really lose things under there very easily.

624
00:39:41,392 --> 00:39:57,210
Scott: The other thing is that the the long part lifts up and the storage underneath so you can put the cushions in there when you know When you're using it in bed mode and you can also put things under there like, you know store things Which is good because it's like, you know, you don't have enough closets in a tiny apartment.

625
00:39:57,371 --> 00:39:59,689
Rym: You can have some storage right in the middle of the room.

626
00:40:00,212 --> 00:40:02,039
Scott: That doesn't take up any extra space.

627
00:40:02,059 --> 00:40:04,148
Scott: like imagine it like think about a living room.

628
00:40:04,248 --> 00:40:06,376
Scott: a couch That's big takes up most of the living room.

629
00:40:06,958 --> 00:40:10,050
Scott: Imagine if like the inside of the couch you could just put stuff.

630
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:15,910
Scott: it's like Damn, like Rym would always shove things under the couch in Beacon.

631
00:40:16,971 --> 00:40:18,276
Scott: You know that didn't belong there.

632
00:40:18,296 --> 00:40:21,649
Rym: I was sort of there like my weights and some Scott Johnson's.

633
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:30,265
Scott: Yeah, that's considered like inappropriate and messy but putting it in when you actually have a storage bin like this Then it's not considered inappropriate or messy.

634
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:36,005
Scott: It's considered Okay, and cool, even though it's basically the same exact thing storing stuff under the couch.

635
00:40:36,607 --> 00:40:39,154
Rym: Of course, I do recall Way back.

636
00:40:39,194 --> 00:40:51,337
Rym: We moved into colony the apartment that Scott and I lived in at RIT Which was basically luxury compared to most of the other apartments at RIT and it was luxury compared to what I Was the middle of the road right?

637
00:40:51,357 --> 00:40:53,750
Scott: I mean cuz the you see was luxury but you had.

638
00:40:55,331 --> 00:40:57,317
Rym: What did you say capstone?

639
00:40:57,357 --> 00:40:59,865
Rym: Yeah, I mean you see what the hell is that?

640
00:40:59,885 --> 00:41:01,650
Scott: I didn't say you see what do you say?

641
00:41:03,815 --> 00:41:09,970
Rym: And the Perkins was slightly newer and fancier, but at the same time kind of dumpier like it was weird.

642
00:41:10,513 --> 00:41:11,298
Scott: It depended on which.

643
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:13,029
Scott: they were all different and strange.

644
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:18,542
Rym: But then there was River Knoll Was a hole and racket Club was our.

645
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:20,429
Rym: oh my god racket Club was like.

646
00:41:21,091 --> 00:41:39,289
Rym: Racket Club was a collection of like 50s temporary housing like these really really really nasty old like 50s era townhouses in Like a sub a suburb and then on the hill was an abandoned hotel that RIT had converted into dorms.

647
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:42,694
Scott: Then there was the RIT Inn and Conference Center Which is basically.

648
00:41:43,136 --> 00:41:51,675
Scott: RIT bought this Marriott and turned it into the RIT hotel and What they did was they were like, oh shit We don't have enough housing for all these students But these students have.

649
00:41:51,816 --> 00:41:56,159
Scott: some of these students have guaranteed housing from us So we'll put them in the hotel that we own.

650
00:41:56,702 --> 00:41:58,469
Rym: that was a mixed blessing for those kids.

651
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:01,641
Scott: Yeah, it's like whoa, I get to live in a hotel for free.

652
00:42:01,742 --> 00:42:06,897
Scott: Oh, I have to live in this faraway hotel Yep, but the thing is in colony.

653
00:42:06,937 --> 00:42:10,207
Rym: we had like this nice one-bedroom apartment with a separate kitchen and like.

654
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:14,670
Rym: it had a foyer Kind of thing and it was actually pretty big all things considered.

655
00:42:16,251 --> 00:42:20,470
Rym: But I remember we were like we moved in and it looked like a real house.

656
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:21,534
Rym: We had like the piano.

657
00:42:21,976 --> 00:42:23,622
Rym: we had a couch and a loveseat.

658
00:42:23,883 --> 00:42:25,630
Rym: We had all real furniture.

659
00:42:26,052 --> 00:42:28,059
Scott: I had that old kitchen table for my parents.

660
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,545
Rym: Yep, like it was weird.

661
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:30,870
Scott: It was the kitchen table of my youth.

662
00:42:30,931 --> 00:42:32,411
Scott: I was sad to see it go Like.

663
00:42:32,431 --> 00:42:39,614
Rym: you walked around colony and you look in our apartment like through the window and you saw like a nice house Like we're normal.

664
00:42:39,895 --> 00:42:42,729
Rym: actual people would live like a family could have been living in that.

665
00:42:43,653 --> 00:42:51,528
Rym: you look in the window next door and you would see like a table that had been broken in two and the pieces were still laying around the room and

666
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:53,174
Scott: there was a hole punched in the

667
00:42:53,214 --> 00:43:03,148
Rym: wall and they didn't have any furniture except the broken table and some like coffee table chair Things and like a beanbag that looked like it had vomit stains on it.

668
00:43:03,772 --> 00:43:07,716
Rym: And as you as you walked around colony Every apartment looked like that.

669
00:43:08,057 --> 00:43:11,350
Rym: as far as I could tell we were the only people in colony who had furniture.

670
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:17,490
Scott: Yeah, I mean most of it was basically they took dorm stuff and they just had a lot more space.

671
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:19,096
Scott: So it was spread out and sparse.

672
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:20,301
Scott: Yeah, and they just.

673
00:43:20,462 --> 00:43:21,646
Scott: it was basically like living in.

674
00:43:21,707 --> 00:43:22,570
Scott: it's like why don't you just live in?

675
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:23,237
Scott: The dorms dude.

676
00:43:23,298 --> 00:43:24,230
Scott: Why did you even bother?

677
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:32,305
Rym: You know coming to me was like how often I look and see just like broken Furniture laying on the floor like I'm knocked over desk that no one ever picked back up.

678
00:43:33,088 --> 00:43:33,249
Scott: Yeah.

679
00:43:33,329 --> 00:43:35,737
Rym: All right No one had curtains except us either.

680
00:43:35,777 --> 00:43:43,544
Rym: as far as I could tell We only had actual curtains in the living room and the bedroom.

681
00:43:43,564 --> 00:43:47,568
Rym: we had ghetto curtains and in the kitchen We had that bed sheet that I hung over the window.

682
00:43:48,611 --> 00:43:51,363
Scott: Yeah, but at least it was something to hang it on over the window.

683
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:51,724
Rym: Yeah.

684
00:43:51,744 --> 00:43:54,535
Scott: Yeah where I am now That's my problem is I've got curtains.

685
00:43:54,575 --> 00:43:56,382
Scott: I just can't get the freaking bar up there.

686
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,570
Scott: I'm gonna try some self tapping screws.

687
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:00,320
Scott: I'm gonna go investigate that line of.

688
00:44:00,702 --> 00:44:06,267
Rym: but the only reason we really had furniture Is because my dad basically gave me all the furniture.

689
00:44:06,287 --> 00:44:07,050
Rym: He didn't need anymore.

690
00:44:07,271 --> 00:44:14,249
Rym: so he gave me that wine cabinet and like a bunch of bookshelves and a bed and That couch in that loveseat.

691
00:44:15,094 --> 00:44:17,650
Rym: The sad thing those couch the couch in loveseat like they were great.

692
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:18,533
Rym: That was like.

693
00:44:18,553 --> 00:44:22,550
Rym: that was that made our apartment the place to hang out for many years at RIT.

694
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:27,450
Rym: We like the center of the crew after my couch basically died and we left it behind.

695
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:28,838
Rym: Well, we left the loveseat.

696
00:44:28,879 --> 00:44:29,724
Rym: No, we left the couch behind.

697
00:44:29,764 --> 00:44:30,630
Scott: Yeah, you're right the couch.

698
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:31,572
Scott: We brought the loveseat.

699
00:44:31,613 --> 00:44:34,300
Rym: loveseat still in beacon the uh, here's the deal.

700
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:41,558
Rym: the couch and loveseat were white with a floral print By the time we took them out of colony.

701
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,550
Rym: They were basically dark gray

702
00:44:47,071 --> 00:44:47,315
Scott: dark gray

703
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:50,774
Rym: Surprisingly dark

704
00:44:51,296 --> 00:44:56,114
Scott: and as dark as my new couch, which is dark on purpose, but still they were Not good,

705
00:44:56,375 --> 00:45:00,970
Rym: they're so ruined like I feel like I should just burn the loveseat that I've got in this

706
00:45:02,073 --> 00:45:04,822
Scott: Outside of colony once there was a burning couch,

707
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:09,797
Rym: you know, it's weird how to this day that memory I don't think stupid college kids.

708
00:45:09,858 --> 00:45:18,364
Rym: It's kind of like this heartwarming memory of the time in my life When I lived in what was effectively here is Greenwood when just

709
00:45:18,384 --> 00:45:26,143
Scott: it's like there was a time in your life where you could look Out your window and there would be a couch on fire on the grass right outside the window And that was perfectly normal and acceptable.

710
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:27,310
Scott: It's just like a burning couch.

711
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:28,493
Rym: Yeah I wonder who did that?

712
00:45:28,533 --> 00:45:34,510
Scott: that happened like, you know anywhere like in nor outside of like a college residential setting.

713
00:45:34,671 --> 00:45:37,710
Scott: It would be like what the fuck a burning couch.

714
00:45:43,012 --> 00:45:48,610
Rym: So I remember like I walked past the burning couch and I'm like, huh and I just went into the apartment like didn't think everything.

715
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:50,018
Rym: I was like Scott this burning couch.

716
00:45:50,058 --> 00:45:51,708
Rym: He's like really we walk outside.

717
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:55,960
Scott: There it is Far enough away from any buildings to actually set anything on fire.

718
00:45:56,141 --> 00:46:00,990
Rym: eventually campus safety came over the campus safety guy I remember because by then the fire had gone out.

719
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:06,586
Rym: It was just like the the skeleton of a couch and by char all around and he had this look of.

720
00:46:07,147 --> 00:46:08,010
Rym: are you serious?

721
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:10,228
Rym: These god damn it you kids.

722
00:46:11,293 --> 00:46:13,749
Rym: But that was all like it was gonna get rid of this cat.

723
00:46:17,488 --> 00:46:24,930
Rym: I Kind of miss those days of just you know The weirdos just doing their weird shit around you like here in the screaming and bang.

724
00:46:25,455 --> 00:46:26,908
Scott: No, I really want to.

725
00:46:26,928 --> 00:46:36,058
Scott: you know If I had a jillion dollars still I would open I would buy an apartment building or a compound or some kind of Residential condo something and make it geeks.

726
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:38,807
Scott: only somehow, you know get around the housing laws.

727
00:46:38,887 --> 00:46:39,930
Scott: Everyone else gets around them.

728
00:46:40,111 --> 00:46:41,397
Rym: Yeah, they're building you're living in now.

729
00:46:41,458 --> 00:46:42,704
Rym: imagine if it was only geeks.

730
00:46:43,347 --> 00:46:43,870
Rym: I know right.

731
00:46:44,071 --> 00:46:44,874
Rym: Oh, you know what happened?

732
00:46:45,156 --> 00:46:48,189
Rym: They'd be able to put stuff in those hallways geeky stuff.

733
00:46:52,092 --> 00:46:56,610
Scott: Yeah, I'd like to put just like a plant out I could put I could put a dorm to this day.

734
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:58,276
Rym: I think I think you want to plant there.

735
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:03,290
Rym: just because you read Stefan wolf and he talks about that plan in the like student of the apartment.

736
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,868
Scott: Because you know, it'd be less echoey.

737
00:47:07,432 --> 00:47:10,345
Scott: But no, I was looking at doormats and I can't just get any doormat.

738
00:47:10,365 --> 00:47:11,530
Scott: I have to get a nerdy doormat.

739
00:47:12,112 --> 00:47:16,110
Scott: There's one from think geek that says there's no place like one to seven dot over that over that one.

740
00:47:17,131 --> 00:47:18,175
Rym: I've seen that that's a good one.

741
00:47:18,738 --> 00:47:19,541
Scott: It's 40 bucks.

742
00:47:20,325 --> 00:47:21,148
Rym: It's not worth 40 bucks.

743
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:25,144
Scott: No, I might just end up getting a normal cheap one.

744
00:47:25,184 --> 00:47:34,170
Rym: That's totally lame Because it's weird how the culture of Like the culture and style of couch is like in any like nice city and apartments are like anywhere trendy.

745
00:47:34,672 --> 00:47:41,109
Rym: Yeah, most people have like the modern or the ultra modern couches like they have the low squared off kind of couches.

746
00:47:41,973 --> 00:47:55,804
Rym: but you go to like any house like an actual house outside of a city city and People have the same like l-shaped kind of couch, but it's like the curvy shape with the really puffy Sometimes the floral print because they have more room to put it in.

747
00:47:55,864 --> 00:48:03,870
Scott: if you have a big-ass living room You can get like a big-ass sectional thing, you know No problem and fit it and it will work well in your giant room.

748
00:48:04,732 --> 00:48:07,770
Rym: Well, we had one when I was a kid and no one ever sat at the corner of it.

749
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:09,610
Rym: It was just wasted space and all the space.

750
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:17,881
Scott: When we go over to their house the whole couch fills up with people.

751
00:48:18,182 --> 00:48:28,973
Rym: when I was a kid the couch in the in the Living room as opposed to the family room Had like a queen size bed that came out of it or the part where the queen size bed came out of could seat like three Or four people.

752
00:48:29,475 --> 00:48:32,530
Rym: then at the corner bit that no one ever sat on except maybe the dogs occasionally.

753
00:48:33,132 --> 00:48:41,689
Rym: And then it had two more seats with a little island between them and the island had cup holders and a place for a phone And stuff and both of those seats reclined.

754
00:48:42,415 --> 00:48:44,330
Scott: Yep, I've seen those that's exactly.

755
00:48:44,396 --> 00:48:54,768
Scott: Yeah My relatives have something similar to that and when basically the family when we go over there It fills up completely with people sitting on it and every time someone gets up someone else goes up spot and jumps onto it.

756
00:48:54,888 --> 00:48:58,123
Scott: Yeah so That's how that goes.

757
00:48:58,346 --> 00:49:05,216
Rym: Yep It'll be weird to not have big couches like that all over the place because I can't even if I get an apartment in the City unless I make like.

758
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:12,269
Rym: my raise is crazy and I make like three or four hundred thousand dollars a year I can't afford a place big enough to have like 20 people hanging out in it.

759
00:49:12,732 --> 00:49:19,404
Rym: I mean look at now and like people come over to hang out in Beacon We've got like, you know the couch in the loveseat and they're both full of people.

760
00:49:19,845 --> 00:49:27,870
Rym: people are sitting in the chair People are sitting on like every surface and every like item and people are also sitting on the floor and still some people are standing.

761
00:49:28,991 --> 00:49:33,950
Scott: People are going to the kitchen people are in other rooms people are on the stairs people are in the bathroom and the toilet.

762
00:49:34,253 --> 00:49:35,949
Rym: Yep, New Year's even worse God.

763
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:37,698
Scott: Yeah, that's what I'm.

764
00:49:37,819 --> 00:49:38,527
Scott: that's what I'm talking about.

765
00:49:38,567 --> 00:49:42,790
Rym: New Year's I'm talking about just like even a game at this point when we play burning wheel.

766
00:49:43,531 --> 00:49:45,017
Scott: Yeah, the other thing about cow, right?

767
00:49:45,097 --> 00:49:47,205
Scott: Is that a sectional couch, right?

768
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:48,530
Scott: It's like, you know, whatever.

769
00:49:48,651 --> 00:50:06,768
Scott: But if you you know if you got a lot of space But the modern couch is not only are they square and modern looking But if you have a small amount of space you need to use it efficiently and it's a lot easier to just imagine in your Brain, you know ways to use space efficiently when things are square if things are rounded or puffy.

770
00:50:06,888 --> 00:50:07,289
Scott: It's like it's.

771
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:11,159
Scott: Well, I realize something on a less efficient use of space.

772
00:50:11,521 --> 00:50:14,290
Scott: It's hard to calculate the more efficient use of space.

773
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:21,909
Scott: It's like it was hard to calculate the way to curve the stealth bomber But it wasn't hard to calculate the f-117 that was more flat and angular.

774
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:25,589
Rym: Honto honto rock and roll Bamba.

775
00:50:28,815 --> 00:50:33,419
Rym: But I had this crazy revelation, right so With your ultra modern couch.

776
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,994
Rym: you did what all the trendy people do which is smart Which I wish we'd thought of it.

777
00:50:37,014 --> 00:50:44,441
Rym: fucking RIT is put the couch in the middle of the room Because that's something is like, you know, I was basically right.

778
00:50:44,622 --> 00:50:56,516
Scott: every time I've ever put arranged furniture Basically my plan has always been put all the furniture against the wall bookcase against the wall desk against the wall couch against the wall TV against the wall, right.

779
00:50:56,817 --> 00:50:59,890
Scott: and the only thing I wouldn't put against the wall would be like coffee table.

780
00:51:00,211 --> 00:51:08,610
Scott: You know cuz that or sometimes I'd think okay the recliner can sort of be a little bit inwards, you know Yeah, but everything would always be against the wall.

781
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:13,350
Scott: So my limitation on furniture would always be I guess kitchen table wouldn't be against the wall.

782
00:51:14,031 --> 00:51:18,350
Rym: Kitchen doesn't count but every house I lived in with the same way like all the houses as a kid with one exception.

783
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:19,930
Rym: But I'll get to that because that's part of the revelation.

784
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:22,524
Rym: Like they were all like that everything went around the walls.

785
00:51:22,544 --> 00:51:23,350
Rym: We moved to the colony.

786
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:24,234
Rym: What's the first thing we did?

787
00:51:24,515 --> 00:51:28,270
Rym: we put all the furniture against the walls and then a year later or two years later?

788
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:33,510
Rym: We shifted it all like a hundred and eighty degrees along the walls, right?

789
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:41,449
Scott: So I was looking in the IKEA catalog and I see it's like everything in the IKEA catalog looks amazing Like I want to just if I had a zillion dollars.

790
00:51:42,152 --> 00:51:47,106
Scott: Like even though IKEA stuff is not the most expensive best quality furniture in the universe.

791
00:51:47,748 --> 00:51:53,810
Scott: It's functional It works and the price is good, you know, and it actually looks really great in the catalog.

792
00:51:54,051 --> 00:51:57,050
Scott: I would even if I was mega rich, right?

793
00:51:57,810 --> 00:51:59,978
Scott: I would just like have IKEA people come in.

794
00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:03,130
Scott: I'd be like fill this house with furniture make it look like the catalog.

795
00:52:03,511 --> 00:52:08,510
Scott: All right, and I looked in the catalog and every time I saw a couch it was never against the wall.

796
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:13,024
Scott: It was always in the middle of the room sort of a faraway and the behind it there'd be bookcases.

797
00:52:13,084 --> 00:52:17,799
Scott: and I was like, oh So here's my revelation.

798
00:52:18,061 --> 00:52:19,610
Rym: here's why we never thought of that.

799
00:52:20,332 --> 00:52:24,990
Scott: I thought back because we didn't look at the IKEA catalog for a half hour thinking how do I do that?

800
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:28,225
Rym: Just that I went back to the house.

801
00:52:28,285 --> 00:52:32,789
Rym: I lived in 4185 Harvard Street in like Detroit

802
00:52:33,654 --> 00:52:34,390
Scott: Harvard Street

803
00:52:35,251 --> 00:52:53,310
Rym: Harvard Street and in that house, we had a pretty big living room and We had a couch against the wall One wall and basically had like a foyer with like this cool French glass door like to get into the house You walk in and it's like a kind of a like a rectangular room kind of long.

804
00:52:53,812 --> 00:53:03,210
Rym: So there was a couch against one wall a big couch and the loveseat was Perpendicular to the couch facing away from the front door and against one of the walls on one edge.

805
00:53:03,632 --> 00:53:08,916
Rym: But otherwise in the middle of the rooms, there was like 10 feet of space behind it Toward the front of the house.

806
00:53:09,277 --> 00:53:16,770
Rym: And so we made it basically made like this L-shaped area that was the living room and behind the couch was like more space.

807
00:53:18,192 --> 00:53:21,949
Rym: It was a lot like what you did in your apartment if you had multiple couches basically and a bigger space.

808
00:53:22,572 --> 00:53:28,404
Rym: Yeah, but the space behind the couch Was really never used for anything.

809
00:53:28,445 --> 00:53:43,870
Rym: you want to know why non Ultramodern or modern couches are really really tall and when they're tall like that it disrupts the flow of the room and it feels like more of this boundary and People end up like they don't walk behind it.

810
00:53:44,111 --> 00:53:48,143
Scott: They don't see stuff like how much room there is on the side of the couches.

811
00:53:48,504 --> 00:53:52,268
Rym: if there's more room like enough room It's basically like a separate room.

812
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:56,769
Rym: But if you have an ultramodern house, it feels like the same room if the couch is low like that.

813
00:53:58,172 --> 00:53:59,702
Rym: I think that's why we never thought of it.

814
00:54:00,024 --> 00:54:03,342
Rym: had we had a low couch We would have done it without even thinking we would have been like duh.

815
00:54:03,362 --> 00:54:03,945
Rym: That's where you put it.

816
00:54:04,789 --> 00:54:07,602
Scott: Yeah Anyway, can we pause the show for a second?

817
00:54:07,642 --> 00:54:08,666
Scott: Cuz I have to poop real bad.

818
00:54:08,686 --> 00:54:13,153
Rym: Okay Have a good poop It was alright.

819
00:54:13,695 --> 00:54:14,117
Rym: Okay, then.

820
00:54:14,137 --> 00:54:17,350
Rym: So where were we talking about couches couches?

821
00:54:18,192 --> 00:54:19,541
Scott: I think we should talk about the fucker.

822
00:54:19,622 --> 00:54:23,076
Rym: just you know, so We needed a couch.

823
00:54:23,137 --> 00:54:33,949
Scott: basically we were gonna take that crappy ass love seat with Rochester to beacon and we were gonna bring both of those couches with us the ones that had turned from white to not white.

824
00:54:35,031 --> 00:54:39,590
Rym: So, you know aside from the whole story of the move which that could be a whole show in and of itself.

825
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:40,475
Rym: But we didn't tell it already.

826
00:54:40,515 --> 00:54:43,210
Rym: That was that was a crazy time driving that truck.

827
00:54:43,772 --> 00:54:48,950
Rym: I think I knocked over every corner trash can in my path in Rochester until I got it on the freeway.

828
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:55,690
Scott: Yeah, but anyway we were gonna bring these two couches but then a couch came out of nowhere.

829
00:54:55,891 --> 00:54:59,283
Rym: Emily's parents were like, oh we have this old sleeper sofa.

830
00:54:59,303 --> 00:55:00,026
Rym: That's really nice.

831
00:55:00,066 --> 00:55:01,070
Rym: You can take it if you want.

832
00:55:01,511 --> 00:55:02,835
Rym: So we were like fuck.

833
00:55:02,855 --> 00:55:07,890
Rym: Yeah, so we basically threw that all that one couch away like we just left it outside immediately.

834
00:55:08,131 --> 00:55:10,499
Scott: No, I thought we just left it there and Kevin.

835
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:16,022
Rym: Yeah, we had cats effectively throwing it away leaving it there that couch I think he said he threw it out.

836
00:55:16,707 --> 00:55:22,850
Rym: Yeah He was like, I'm not keeping this But anyway, so we drove out to Emily's parents house.

837
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:27,241
Rym: We got this couch and it was a sleeper sofa kind of an old one really nice.

838
00:55:27,582 --> 00:55:28,745
Rym: It was exactly what we needed.

839
00:55:29,808 --> 00:55:33,978
Rym: it weighed Approximately nine thousand pounds.

840
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:35,162
Scott: Yeah, cuz I mean it was the.

841
00:55:35,283 --> 00:55:40,210
Scott: it was the old-school style, you know It had a whole mattress in it that folded in under the cushion.

842
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:51,661
Scott: So you take the cushions off and they unfold this bed and the bed is like this, you know It's this big metal folding contraption going on and it way, you know It's a big bed frame basically inside an already heavy couch.

843
00:55:52,163 --> 00:56:00,229
Scott: So it's like yeah that weighs a lot Yeah, and also it was long and unwieldy and difficult to lift.

844
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:07,830
Rym: cuz you know You got this frame isn't really held in there that well now We haven't thought our clever plan through so we we wouldn't have been able to deal with this thing on our own.

845
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:10,788
Rym: But luckily Pete took the day off work and actually helped us move in.

846
00:56:12,371 --> 00:56:19,296
Rym: So I recall I was trying to lift that thing and get it into the house and Immediately Pete was like our.

847
00:56:19,316 --> 00:56:20,181
Rym: let's move this fucker.

848
00:56:20,482 --> 00:56:22,402
Rym: fuck Jesus fuck Christ Fuck me.

849
00:56:22,422 --> 00:56:24,937
Rym: in it the word fuck was said more than any other words.

850
00:56:24,957 --> 00:56:30,348
Rym: the next half hour after we decided to move that thing and That's the couch became the fucker.

851
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:39,450
Rym: The worst thing is we finally like after a lot of work and a lot of time We get it just into the couch or into the house and we did bangs against the wall.

852
00:56:39,611 --> 00:56:42,683
Rym: We immediately like bang it into the wall because it's being like gash in the wall.

853
00:56:42,703 --> 00:56:44,490
Rym: we had to fix that and clean it later.

854
00:56:45,211 --> 00:56:46,259
Rym: Yeah, we're like, ah great.

855
00:56:46,279 --> 00:57:00,910
Rym: We just move into this house already ruined it so we manhandled the thing after another like 10 minutes in the living room against the wall and Pete's like Not only am I not moving it beyond this point, but I am never again in my life moving a sleeper SOPA.

856
00:57:01,272 --> 00:57:05,695
Rym: So help me God who does not exist in heaven Fuck you.

857
00:57:06,016 --> 00:57:06,820
Rym: Fuck this couch.

858
00:57:07,181 --> 00:57:09,050
Rym: I'm sleeping on it to assert my dominance.

859
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:13,430
Rym: That's right, and he did sleep on that couch and he asserted his dominance.

860
00:57:15,033 --> 00:57:16,648
Scott: Yes, there's dominant over that couch.

861
00:57:17,292 --> 00:57:19,021
Rym: Fuck I don't know how we're gonna get that couch out of here.

862
00:57:19,383 --> 00:57:19,986
Rym: We're like free.

863
00:57:20,006 --> 00:57:24,647
Rym: if you can get it out I have a solution Leave it set it on fire.

864
00:57:27,771 --> 00:57:30,983
Rym: Then it'll be easier now because most of the weight is that steel frame.

865
00:57:31,003 --> 00:57:33,051
Rym: the steel frames gonna weigh just as much if we burn It.

866
00:57:33,794 --> 00:57:40,510
Scott: you could remove that part and just only take the rest of the couch Just the stuffing and then the upholstery.

867
00:57:41,352 --> 00:57:46,947
Rym: Yeah, I Don't know this was that but this was a cop-out show and I think we're running out of steam.

868
00:57:46,967 --> 00:57:47,449
Rym: Let's just end it.
