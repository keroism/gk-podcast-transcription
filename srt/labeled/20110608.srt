1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:08,840
Scott:

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,716
Rym: It's Wednesday, June 8th, 2011.

3
00:00:11,716 --> 00:00:12,578
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:13,239
Scott: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,603
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

6
00:00:14,623 --> 00:00:17,690
Rym: Tonight's double feature, Wakfu and Hippy-a-ra.

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,848
Rym: Let's do this.

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,485
Scott: So did you see Steve Jobs?

9
00:00:26,746 --> 00:00:32,731
Scott: He was all going to the Cupertino town council and showing him the building he wants to build to put all his people in.

10
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:34,300
Rym: I did not see that.

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,540
Scott: Oh, because basically what happened there, right, is the Apple's got too many people now for their campus, right?

12
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,789
Scott: So HP is leaving to go to a different town.

13
00:00:42,849 --> 00:00:50,717
Scott: So they basically, HP's moving out and he's buying HP's land and he wants to build this gigantic 12,000 person circular building.

14
00:00:50,777 --> 00:00:51,480
Scott: Actually looks pretty cool.

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,032
Rym: Oh, you realize that's one RIT.

16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,063
Scott: Yeah.

17
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:58,953
Scott: You know, and it's actually a pretty good plan.

18
00:00:58,973 --> 00:01:00,440
Scott: I was like, oh dude, that's sweet, right?

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,600
Rym: Alright, but there's clearly a but here.

20
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,769
Scott: So my office is doing a similar situation, right?

21
00:01:05,889 --> 00:01:15,500
Scott: Where it's like, basically this, you know, a company bought us and they have another office in town, but our office is better, so they want to move their people in their other office in town into our office.

22
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:20,316
Rym: We did a similar thing before where we basically bought as much of our floor as we could.

23
00:01:20,336 --> 00:01:21,380
Rym: We have like most of the floor.

24
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:30,608
Rym: And then we were doing all this renovations, we needed all this space, and then now that we laid off a quarter of the company, we don't need that space anymore.

25
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:33,460
Rym: So now, after a long time, they're kind of down renovating.

26
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:44,349
Scott: But anyway, so for like months, there have been people coming in, because we work in an area of the office that was sort of empty, and it was just us and a bunch of empty space.

27
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:46,820
Scott: So that was clearly the space to be renovated.

28
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,244
Rym: I mean, it was like that in the IBM.

29
00:01:48,264 --> 00:01:50,652
Rym: I mean, my hallway was like half empty.

30
00:01:50,773 --> 00:01:54,458
Rym: in the building and the floor under us, there were just like empty locked rooms.

31
00:01:54,821 --> 00:02:09,306
Scott: Right, so, you know, that's the space they were going to move into, so people have been walking around us and whispering and all this kind of, you know, and like, we've noticed people walking around with measuring tapes and blueprints and all sorts of stuff for months and weeks, but no one told us dick.

32
00:02:10,494 --> 00:02:11,640
Scott: And it's like, uh...

33
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:19,800
Rym: I'm starting to get sick of, it's weird how all the smaller companies I've worked for are like, they're so secretive about everything.

34
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:21,448
Scott: Yeah, that's what I really want to talk about, right?

35
00:02:21,468 --> 00:02:27,120
Scott: Because basically, you know, we found out, you know, I don't care what they decide, put me in a tiny box, put me in a big office, I don't really care, right?

36
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:33,160
Scott: But it's like, they just wait till the last second to tell you anything, and they're just so discourteous and secretive for no reason.

37
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,635
Scott: But look at Steve Jobs, the most secretive guy in the universe, right?

38
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:45,387
Scott: He doesn't want anyone to know anything, but he'll go to the town council, a public forum, and see, here's the giant building I want to build, here's the blueprints, here's what we want to do, right?

39
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:49,906
Scott: He's out about it, you know, stuff like that, stuff that affects the employees.

40
00:02:50,347 --> 00:02:54,740
Scott: He's going to tell the employee what the employee needs to know, and the people in the town what they need to know.

41
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,791
Scott: He's not going to, you know, keep things secret just for no reason.

42
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:00,060
Scott: He has at least what he thinks is the reason most of the time.

43
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,624
Rym: Well, I think it's a more general problem.

44
00:03:01,645 --> 00:03:07,973
Rym: There are a lot of, I'm feeling like secrets are one of the biggest problems we've got right now, because secrets cause corruption.

45
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:15,780
Scott: Yeah, we talk all about the time, mostly what we talk about is that government unnecessarily keeps too many things confidential.

46
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:30,380
Scott: But it's not just government that has a problem with secrets, and it's not just companies either, it's just people in general keep things secret unnecessarily for no reason and often cause more harm than, you know, that didn't need to be caused.

47
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:44,700
Scott: If they would just share information, basically people follow a policy of keep everything secret except for what you absolutely can't keep secret, where what you should do is keep everything public except for what you absolutely cannot make public.

48
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:46,560
Scott: That is the policy you need to follow.

49
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:54,120
Rym: But specifically with the corporate stuff, like in jobs, it's really weird to me that the mundane stuff is usually a better kept secret.

50
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:59,080
Rym: Like, I didn't even know about the layoffs back when we had all the layoffs until the day it happened.

51
00:04:00,243 --> 00:04:01,530
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, that's an HR thing.

52
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,420
Scott: There's sometimes legal reasons you have to keep that secret.

53
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,169
Rym: But simultaneously, there's a corporate move.

54
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:11,100
Rym: To this day, I don't officially know that we're moving offices and they're moving stuff around.

55
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,094
Rym: I know no, because I know shit, but I don't officially know.

56
00:04:15,174 --> 00:04:16,680
Rym: No one has officially informed me of anything.

57
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:18,380
Rym: It's annoying.

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,160
Scott: It is, it's very annoying.

59
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,940
Rym: Much like how the anime industry is super secretive about everything for no reason.

60
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:38,059
Scott: And it's totally, you know, in a situation like I'm in where it's like, I'm working here, you're someone who's moving in, this affects me and the people I'm working with, and it's just, you know, it's just discourteous not to tell us.

61
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:39,279
Rym: At the same time.

62
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:41,149
Scott: It's like, you're not obligated to tell me.

63
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:43,580
Scott: You don't need to make me a part of the decision making process.

64
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,180
Rym: More than once.

65
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:44,743
Scott: But you know what?

66
00:04:44,783 --> 00:04:47,880
Scott: But the fact that you don't tell me makes me think you're a jerk.

67
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,740
Scott: It's like, the only really harm you've done is make me hate the upper management and think they're all jerks.

68
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,920
Rym: But at the same time, are you not simply a mercenary?

69
00:04:57,322 --> 00:04:58,680
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, the point is, you know.

70
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,612
Rym: I mean, you don't tell the mercenaries the strategy.

71
00:05:01,237 --> 00:05:01,740
Rym: You don't care.

72
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,276
Scott: But if they just told me, I wouldn't think they were jerks.

73
00:05:04,316 --> 00:05:04,839
Scott: I would like them.

74
00:05:05,161 --> 00:05:09,700
Rym: Ah, but does you thinking someone's a jerk in any way materially impact anything?

75
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,419
Scott: Yeah, it makes me want to get out of there.

76
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:13,699
Scott: Yeah, but you- And they don't want me to leave.

77
00:05:14,503 --> 00:05:15,399
Rym: Ah, we'll see what happens.

78
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:23,120
Scott: The other thing, right, the other situation is, right, is like when a big higher up guy, right, gets a gigantic office and everyone else is stuck in tiny cubes, right?

79
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,091
Scott: And it's like, okay, you're the highest up guy.

80
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:26,840
Scott: You have a right to do that, right?

81
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,940
Scott: That is your privilege for being, you know, the top CEO or whatever you are.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,199
Rym: Or I can understand situations where there are people who have enough responsibility to where they need kind of a private large office with just space to have meetings and do stuff in.

83
00:05:40,022 --> 00:05:43,780
Rym: I mean, I don't need to host private meetings often enough to have my own dedicated space.

84
00:05:44,062 --> 00:05:46,440
Rym: I can go, you know, check out one of the conference rooms.

85
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:56,340
Scott: Of course, but by doing so, right, by having an excessively large office, what message did that send to the rest of the employees, right?

86
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:57,284
Scott: You know, it's like.

87
00:05:57,344 --> 00:06:00,115
Scott: basically you're saying, I'm a big jerk.

88
00:06:00,155 --> 00:06:01,380
Scott: Who cares about myself?

89
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,187
Scott: Fuck you all.

90
00:06:02,248 --> 00:06:03,079
Scott: Get in the tiny cube.

91
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,720
Scott: You know, it's like you have a right to put me in a tiny cube.

92
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,160
Rym: What if it's meritocracy, Scott?

93
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,260
Rym: What if it's where the people whose jobs are most important have the nicest offices?

94
00:06:10,905 --> 00:06:11,580
Scott: I'm just saying.

95
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,458
Rym: I'm just saying, what if?

96
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:14,260
Rym: Would you be mad if it was a meritocracy?

97
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:16,980
Scott: You know, it depends.

98
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,320
Rym: I mean, the people who are better get paid more.

99
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,180
Rym: How is that different than having a bigger office?

100
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,680
Scott: Actually, I think that it shouldn't be secret when people get paid either.

101
00:06:25,984 --> 00:06:27,239
Rym: I'm very open about what I get paid.

102
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:27,957
Scott: Yeah, me too.

103
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:41,059
Rym: Except at work because everyone's like, well, actually everyone I know outside of like the geek community and outside of like, you know, my circle of friends, people are super cagey and really don't want other people to know what they make.

104
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,480
Scott: Well, I think it's actually that is sort of a conspiracy by companies.

105
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,400
Scott: They don't what they want.

106
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:53,696
Scott: They someone intentionally back in the day wanted some company wanted to make it a stigma to let people know what you made.

107
00:06:53,736 --> 00:07:03,620
Rym: because not to not to name names, companies I have worked for or may currently work for have stipulations in contracts stating that I cannot disclose to other employees how much I make.

108
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,699
Rym: Or other benefits that I have.

109
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,158
Rym: That's right.

110
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,420
Rym: Like, for example, I have stock options in my company, right?

111
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:08,798
Rym: Yeah.

112
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,680
Rym: Most of my co-workers don't even know stock options were an option.

113
00:07:13,927 --> 00:07:15,500
Rym: And I'm not allowed to tell them that I have them.

114
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,060
Scott: It's only a benefit to employees to know what your fellow employees make.

115
00:07:21,245 --> 00:07:26,247
Scott: If you all shared, if everyone told everyone else what you made, then, you know, you might.

116
00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:30,020
Scott: someone might be upset at finding out that they're being paid a lot less than someone else.

117
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:34,500
Scott: But since everyone knows how much everyone's contributing, right?

118
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:40,380
Scott: It's like if I get paid a little less than this other guy who does more work than me, it's like we look at each other and we're like, yeah, all right, you do more work.

119
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,820
Rym: But usually what happens is a company has someone who's been there a long time.

120
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:44,697
Rym: They need them.

121
00:07:44,941 --> 00:07:47,180
Rym: So they're giving them increasing salaries to keep them around.

122
00:07:47,584 --> 00:07:48,619
Rym: And then they hire someone new.

123
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:54,200
Rym: And because that person might not be familiar with the pay grades of that industry, they pay them the minimum possible.

124
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:54,860
Scott: Exactly.

125
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,240
Scott: So sharing information, someone might be upset at finding out the truth.

126
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:06,800
Scott: But then if you actually had balls and would go to the people who make the decisions to be like, hey, we've discovered this is unfair.

127
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,760
Scott: Fix it, asshole.

128
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:08,640
Scott: Right.

129
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:15,080
Scott: Then suddenly they're in the ones who are in the deep shit and the employees become empowered, even without unionizing.

130
00:08:15,401 --> 00:08:19,920
Scott: Just by sharing information, you could empower yourselves and get more money for everyone.

131
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,519
Scott: You're not going to get less money for anyone.

132
00:08:21,988 --> 00:08:22,220
Scott: Right.

133
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:29,640
Scott: You're just going to get more money by sharing this information at the expense of, you know, some people who are really sensitive, you know, being upset.

134
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:33,320
Scott: But I'm sure they won't be upset if they had the balls to go and fight for their money.

135
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:41,539
Rym: But I foresee the people who are most likely to be upset are the ones who aren't paid that much and who probably don't have any sway to be paid anymore.

136
00:08:42,152 --> 00:08:42,320
Scott: Right.

137
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:47,460
Scott: So then it's just, hey, you know, you've there was a truth that you aren't really worth that much to us.

138
00:08:47,582 --> 00:08:48,479
Scott: And now it is revealed.

139
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:49,358
Scott: Great.

140
00:08:49,808 --> 00:08:49,956
Rym: Yeah.

141
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,959
Scott: And your choice is to continue working here or not get a job somewhere else because you suck.

142
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,439
Rym: I will at least for now continue to make my one hundred and thirty five thousand dollars a year.

143
00:08:58,581 --> 00:08:58,793
Scott: Yeah.

144
00:08:59,163 --> 00:08:59,832
Scott: I make 70 something.

145
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,317
Scott: I don't even know.

146
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:01,796
Scott: Wow.

147
00:09:02,183 --> 00:09:03,679
Rym: I make almost double what you make.

148
00:09:04,322 --> 00:09:06,239
Rym: And yet you probably do more work than me.

149
00:09:06,501 --> 00:09:06,876
Scott: No, no.

150
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,660
Scott: But you're going to watch out.

151
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,339
Scott: I'm going to fight next.

152
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,220
Scott: Because the thing is, I'm so I'm too nice.

153
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:10,328
Scott: Right.

154
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,080
Scott: As much as I say the balls to fight for whatever.

155
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,519
Rym: I've been thinking about that lately because I know my problem.

156
00:09:15,981 --> 00:09:17,820
Rym: I've been seriously debate doing the same.

157
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:25,420
Scott: Yeah, because I think that's that's what you know, how we always talk about, you know, the nerds who could be the most dangerous, who could bring society crashing down or too nice.

158
00:09:25,601 --> 00:09:27,320
Scott: That's why we don't do terrorism, even though we could.

159
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:27,740
Scott: Right.

160
00:09:28,122 --> 00:09:28,940
Scott: And it's the same thing.

161
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:29,739
Scott: It's like I'm a nerd.

162
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,338
Scott: I'm too nice.

163
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:33,620
Scott: I don't go in there and be like, give me more money.

164
00:09:33,982 --> 00:09:34,194
Scott: Asshole.

165
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,140
Rym: It depends.

166
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,280
Rym: It depends on how much you care.

167
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,240
Rym: I mean, I'll be honest.

168
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:46,859
Rym: When I worked at my previous job hospital, I went into my boss and I was like, look, unless you give me a hundred percent raise, I'm going to give you my two weeks notice.

169
00:09:48,142 --> 00:09:51,460
Rym: And then, yeah, the guy was like, yeah, that was me.

170
00:09:51,581 --> 00:09:52,260
Scott: That was quitting.

171
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:52,558
Scott: Right.

172
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,039
Scott: That wasn't actually negotiating.

173
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,162
Rym: Well, I gave.

174
00:09:55,183 --> 00:10:05,660
Rym: I gave an ultimatum because had he doubled my salary, I might I probably would have stuck around a little while longer than quit anyway after I had a pile of money.

175
00:10:05,802 --> 00:10:06,980
Rym: But that's a separate problem.

176
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:07,460
Scott: Right.

177
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,619
Scott: But the point is, I'm too nice.

178
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:15,020
Scott: I've never once actually negotiated or fought because everyone who's ever paid me has paid me enough to live.

179
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,131
Scott: Right.

180
00:10:15,261 --> 00:10:15,919
Scott: I'm paying the rent.

181
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:23,260
Scott: I'm buying everything I could possibly want to buy, you know, giant boxes of comic books every month, computers, anything I need an Amazon.

182
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:29,259
Scott: I just buy it without thinking I pay the rent, I pay all the bills and my bank account balance just keeps going up.

183
00:10:29,361 --> 00:10:30,880
Scott: So I'm like, I'm so non greedy.

184
00:10:31,325 --> 00:10:32,139
Scott: I'm just like, whatever.

185
00:10:32,643 --> 00:10:34,760
Scott: So I never fight for more money or anything.

186
00:10:34,841 --> 00:10:37,260
Scott: But next time I decide, you know, it's been too long.

187
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:39,940
Scott: I realize you don't get anywhere without fighting.

188
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,479
Scott: So now I'm going to fight the next time I get a chance when there's a review or whatever there is that ever.

189
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:46,600
Rym: Ah, my company is very smart about that.

190
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,299
Rym: They stopped giving reviews years ago.

191
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,900
Scott: So that's a genius move.

192
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:50,479
Rym: So that way.

193
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,239
Rym: Because think about this.

194
00:10:51,341 --> 00:10:52,620
Rym: No one ever asks you anymore.

195
00:10:53,103 --> 00:10:54,179
Rym: Hey, are you happy?

196
00:10:54,642 --> 00:10:55,339
Rym: What's going on?

197
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,920
Rym: So you never have an excuse to be like, yeah, I'm kind of bored.

198
00:10:58,302 --> 00:10:59,020
Scott: But it doesn't matter.

199
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,409
Scott: There is going to be some sort of H.R.

200
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,555
Scott: event at some point.

201
00:11:02,575 --> 00:11:06,259
Scott: that will give me an opportunity to negotiate in some form.

202
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,100
Scott: But when that comes, I'm basically going to be like, look, I want 30 vacation days.

203
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,080
Scott: I know I've been joking about 30 vacation days, but now I'm actually serious.

204
00:11:13,622 --> 00:11:14,979
Scott: I want 30 vacation days.

205
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:15,844
Scott: No, I'm not.

206
00:11:15,985 --> 00:11:18,500
Scott: I'm not getting if you don't give me 30 vacation.

207
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,360
Rym: Well, your logic is sound because to summarize it, you basically pointed out that, all right, you could make more money elsewhere.

208
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:24,312
Rym: Both of us could.

209
00:11:24,556 --> 00:11:24,719
Scott: Yeah.

210
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,740
Rym: But, you know, it's a pain in the ass to switch jobs and all that sort of thing.

211
00:11:29,143 --> 00:11:30,560
Rym: And anyone can just offer more money.

212
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:34,139
Rym: So there's no benefit to fighting for more money one place versus another place.

213
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:41,800
Rym: But nobody, for some reason, the American like industry system is fucked up to where nobody gives anybody shit for vacation days.

214
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,268
Scott: That's right.

215
00:11:42,492 --> 00:11:42,858
Scott: Even me.

216
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:43,732
Scott: But in Europe.

217
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:44,080
Scott: Right.

218
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,400
Scott: It's 30 days minimum and no one has any jobs.

219
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,660
Scott: There are some places where it's like 60 days minimum.

220
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,859
Rym: Scott, most people have three hundred and sixty five days.

221
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,189
Scott: Whoa.

222
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:54,639
Rym: Yeah.

223
00:11:54,921 --> 00:12:01,540
Scott: Oh, well, you know, the so the idly wealthy and the unemployed.

224
00:12:03,141 --> 00:12:07,040
Rym: So because no one gives anyone vacation days, I mean, I don't even get as many as I want.

225
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,558
Scott: If they gave me 30 vacation days, I basically would have to stay there for less pay.

226
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:18,180
Scott: for, you know, as long as I could do to come to gave me 30 actual vacation days going anywhere else would reset me to 10.

227
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,500
Rym: Well, the biggest thing I realize the real problem here is pretty fundamental.

228
00:12:22,144 --> 00:12:24,880
Rym: I would take a 50 percent pay cut to work 50 percent of the time.

229
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:25,806
Scott: Yep.

230
00:12:25,826 --> 00:12:26,998
Rym: And that would be awesome for me.

231
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:27,620
Scott: Yep.

232
00:12:27,721 --> 00:12:33,109
Rym: And no one is going to pay me seventy thousand dollars a year to only work six months out of the year.

233
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,900
Scott: No, but here's the other.

234
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,202
Scott: Right.

235
00:12:34,243 --> 00:12:35,879
Scott: So they could give me more money.

236
00:12:36,081 --> 00:12:40,665
Scott: But like I said, even at my current pay, my bank account is increasing because I'm so frugal.

237
00:12:40,686 --> 00:12:41,520
Rym: Yeah, because you're so great.

238
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,940
Rym: We're so rich and we're just rubbing it into all the listeners faces.

239
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:50,524
Scott: Listen, if you guys go and study computer science and are good at it, you can end up in the same way, too.

240
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,302
Rym: But you also got to be lucky and for, you know, you want to the real secret.

241
00:12:53,362 --> 00:13:02,401
Rym: But then what we should get onto the actual show, you know, and the real secret is one, actually be smart to learn computers, because that's where you make all the money.

242
00:13:02,623 --> 00:13:02,844
Rym: Yeah.

243
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:07,080
Rym: There are a few other specialty fields you can make equal money in, but three live in New York computers.

244
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,824
Rym: The ones that we know.

245
00:13:07,844 --> 00:13:10,100
Rym: you don't have to live in New York for a major city.

246
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:10,601
Rym: Yeah.

247
00:13:11,143 --> 00:13:15,842
Rym: But the biggest thing, too, is you've got to be willing and able to sell yourself.

248
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:30,639
Rym: You've got like everyone I see when I interview people to hire, like to work for me, they're like they're so cookie cutter, like I don't remember their names, like everyone looks the same, talks the same, wears the same suit with the same like color, like the power tie and the earth tone.

249
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,340
Rym: The resume is all like identical.

250
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,000
Rym: It's like nobody stands out.

251
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,840
Rym: No one's willing to let their real personality show through.

252
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:40,722
Rym: In an interview, everyone always acts the way they expect corporations to expect them to act.

253
00:13:41,266 --> 00:13:43,379
Rym: You realize every interview I've ever done, I act like me.

254
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:45,609
Scott: That's like the other day when I was in the.

255
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:48,624
Rym: I'm like, yeah, I do a podcast called GeekNights about nerdy shit.

256
00:13:48,644 --> 00:13:56,200
Scott: We usually eat in the park outside of Barclays, which is, you know, it's one of those public private parks like they own it, but it's public.

257
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,740
Scott: Oh, speaking of which, and there were these guys walking around with name tags.

258
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,098
Scott: They're all wearing the same suit.

259
00:14:01,622 --> 00:14:04,339
Scott: And it was like I was like, oh, my God, I'm so glad we're not those guys.

260
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,804
Rym: Yeah, that's actually the fact that my company doesn't have a dress code because I wear suits like every day.

261
00:14:09,844 --> 00:14:17,523
Rym: But now that it's warm today and I was biking to work until my fucking bike got stolen, I stopped wearing suits and started wearing just T-shirts.

262
00:14:17,603 --> 00:14:24,500
Rym: And I kind of don't want to go back to wearing suits ever again, even though I really like wearing suits because I get, you know, it'll never get cold again.

263
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,658
Rym: It's going to be warm like this forever.

264
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:32,080
Rym: Anyway, so anime, manga, comics, news.

265
00:14:33,202 --> 00:14:33,404
Scott: Yep.

266
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:34,860
Scott: Oh, you want some news?

267
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,150
Rym: I think we should actually talk about.

268
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,280
Rym: we don't want to be Dave and Joel here.

269
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:37,603
Rym: All right.

270
00:14:37,623 --> 00:14:39,320
Scott: So there was a gigantic comics news.

271
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,610
Scott: I don't know if we've talked about it on the show.

272
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,438
Scott: I'm pretty sure we haven't.

273
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,042
Scott: All right.

274
00:14:42,062 --> 00:14:43,759
Scott: It's pretty much the biggest comics news ever.

275
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:47,680
Scott: DC Comics is going to relaunch.

276
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,060
Scott: Some people are saying reboot, but the official word is relaunch.

277
00:14:51,943 --> 00:14:53,050
Rym: That's the distinction.

278
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,760
Rym: there matters a lot to people who care.

279
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:55,122
Rym: Right.

280
00:14:55,142 --> 00:14:57,880
Scott: So about this is this is actually what is happening.

281
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,504
Scott: They're going to.

282
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:04,140
Scott: in a couple of months, every comic, every single DC comic will end.

283
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:10,379
Scott: And instead, there will be fifty two new DC comics that will all be number one in the same month.

284
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,380
Scott: And those will be the DC Comics.

285
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,519
Scott: There'll be fifty two of them.

286
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,359
Scott: They will start with number one all over again.

287
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,897
Scott: The thing is, it's a relaunch.

288
00:15:17,998 --> 00:15:18,180
Scott: Right.

289
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:25,177
Scott: So it's like, you know, they're restarting, but they're not completely restarting right from nothing.

290
00:15:25,499 --> 00:15:25,760
Scott: Right.

291
00:15:25,861 --> 00:15:27,099
Scott: But they're sort of restarting.

292
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,720
Scott: So it's like theoretically, if you've never read the comic before, you should be able to read this comic.

293
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,679
Scott: But that's not like they're throwing all the history away in the incinerator.

294
00:15:35,663 --> 00:15:37,599
Scott: At the same time, they're doing something else.

295
00:15:38,622 --> 00:15:43,620
Scott: And I'm not even going to bother talking about like which titles or who's drawing and writing which ones.

296
00:15:44,101 --> 00:15:51,308
Scott: The only one that I think is a big deal is the Jeff Johns, who I hate, and Jim Lee, who I like, are doing Justice League, which I think is like the big one.

297
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:51,994
Scott: they're trying to push.

298
00:15:52,377 --> 00:16:01,880
Scott: But anyway, they're going to also make every comic digital available on the same exact day that it's available on the newsstand.

299
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:03,290
Rym: Oh, shit, son.

300
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,240
Scott: For the same price.

301
00:16:04,661 --> 00:16:06,839
Scott: But there's no more details than that.

302
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,380
Scott: There's probably going to be all sorts of DRM and whatever.

303
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:16,700
Rym: This would have been a stupid idea a long time ago, but there are enough iPads and high resolution phones out to where you can look at color images like that and do OK.

304
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:23,859
Scott: But anyway, and then like a couple of weeks after the comic comes out, it's going to go down from because the comics are going to be three dollars and so with the digital ones.

305
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:28,680
Scott: But a couple of weeks when the comic becomes old, the digital one will go down in price to two dollars.

306
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,550
Scott: So this is like it's.

307
00:16:32,354 --> 00:16:33,620
Scott: it's yet another example.

308
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:34,764
Scott: Right.

309
00:16:34,784 --> 00:16:42,264
Scott: Of comic, you know, company that is was didn't update his business model for the digital age when it should have in nineteen ninety nine.

310
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:44,200
Scott: It's currently twenty eleven.

311
00:16:44,521 --> 00:16:47,019
Scott: They're they're, you know, eleven years, twelve years too late.

312
00:16:49,062 --> 00:16:52,540
Scott: But most companies, the mistake they make is they dip the toe in the water.

313
00:16:52,802 --> 00:16:53,811
Scott: They say, oh, it didn't work.

314
00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:54,840
Scott: And they pull the toe out of the wall.

315
00:16:55,142 --> 00:17:01,040
Rym: You realize the reason they do this is not because they're incompetent on that front, they're incompetent, but not in this specific way.

316
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,779
Rym: It's not like they think these forays into the digital world, these toe dippings are going to work.

317
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,987
Rym: They know they're going to fail.

318
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:08,579
Rym: They're engineered to fail.

319
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,040
Rym: They set them up to where they tip in a little bit and then it fails.

320
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,240
Rym: And they can go back to all the people who matter and say, look, it doesn't work.

321
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:16,397
Rym: Nobody can do this.

322
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:20,640
Rym: And they're trying to make sure that nobody ever does it except steam.

323
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,579
Scott: iTunes all do it just fine.

324
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:24,040
Rym: What superhero comics are doing.

325
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,301
Rym: Right.

326
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:25,634
Scott: But but anyway, the point is this.

327
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,480
Scott: I got to commend them while simultaneously admonishing them.

328
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:29,702
Scott: Right.

329
00:17:29,742 --> 00:17:31,779
Scott: I commend them because this is not a toe dip.

330
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:33,073
Scott: This is a foot dip.

331
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:33,620
Scott: Right.

332
00:17:33,721 --> 00:17:35,034
Scott: Or maybe a down to the knee.

333
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:35,640
Scott: Right.

334
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:41,016
Scott: It's like maybe you're sitting on the edge of the pool and you put both feet in and you're you're thinking about sliding off the edge.

335
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:41,580
Scott: Right.

336
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:47,419
Scott: So it's like they're making a bigger move for the modern world than anyone has ever done before.

337
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:47,600
Scott: Right.

338
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,300
Scott: They're resetting everything to number one.

339
00:17:49,624 --> 00:17:50,476
Scott: That's you know, I like that.

340
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,096
Scott: Making the comics more accessible, if not completely accessible.

341
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:54,800
Scott: Right.

342
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,580
Scott: They're making it digital, available on the same day.

343
00:17:58,221 --> 00:17:58,859
Scott: That's all great.

344
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,440
Scott: But I can still have to admonish them because it's not far enough.

345
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,634
Scott: Here's what they should do.

346
00:18:04,857 --> 00:18:05,040
Scott: Ready?

347
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,040
Scott: Number one, forget about the frickin issues entirely.

348
00:18:09,702 --> 00:18:10,860
Scott: Only digital comics.

349
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,155
Rym: They should try it out now.

350
00:18:12,236 --> 00:18:12,439
Rym: Why?

351
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,440
Rym: Because they're going to make money off of it from the nerd trades only.

352
00:18:15,621 --> 00:18:17,580
Rym: Why not just make the money off the nerds?

353
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,699
Rym: It doesn't cost you anything to do.

354
00:18:18,862 --> 00:18:19,780
Rym: It's just guaranteed profit.

355
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,579
Scott: Because they don't make that much money off the nerds.

356
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:22,980
Rym: Yeah, but they make something.

357
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,519
Rym: The other the other rationale they probably will come up with is that that would end all comic book stores.

358
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:28,868
Scott: That's a tough shipper.

359
00:18:28,888 --> 00:18:29,738
Scott: That doesn't matter to DC.

360
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:39,760
Scott: This is already crushing the comic book stores, because every single person who switches away from comics to digital is now giving their three dollars directly to DC, bypassing the retailer.

361
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,260
Scott: This already really hurts comic book stores.

362
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:48,840
Rym: I don't think it does, because the primary audience currently of comic books are people who buy them because they're collecting.

363
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,740
Scott: But then why the reset to number one?

364
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,720
Scott: Clearly, that is an appeal to the masses.

365
00:18:53,301 --> 00:18:55,439
Rym: It is, perhaps, but I don't know how successful it will be.

366
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,940
Scott: And plus resetting to number one like this.

367
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:05,100
Scott: If you look online at the sort of the fan reactions on many forums, I've looked at two or three and I've looked at comment threads on a couple of comic news sites.

368
00:19:05,762 --> 00:19:06,788
Scott: It's really mixed.

369
00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:08,500
Scott: Like you can't even measure it.

370
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,659
Scott: There's some people who are like, well, I'm done reading DC Comics now.

371
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:12,577
Scott: And there's other people.

372
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,244
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

373
00:19:13,264 --> 00:19:14,180
Rym: And then other people.

374
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:18,720
Rym: Dude in your Green Lantern underwear and Green Lantern sheets, who has every Green Lantern ever.

375
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,474
Rym: Yeah, this is what drove you to quit.

376
00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:20,939
Rym: I'm sure.

377
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,820
Scott: But you know, the thing is, you'd be surprised.

378
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,260
Scott: These people do actually, right?

379
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,066
Scott: When Spider-Man...

380
00:19:25,086 --> 00:19:25,511
Rym: No, they don't.

381
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:26,420
Rym: They keep buying it.

382
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:34,914
Scott: No, you'd be surprised when Spider-Man had that thing a while ago where they took away, where they, you know, revealed who he was and then unrevealed who he was.

383
00:19:34,934 --> 00:19:35,035
Scott: Right.

384
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:41,980
Scott: The sales on Spider-Man, there are tons of fanboys stopped buying it and other people started buying it.

385
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,080
Scott: It was like this big shift.

386
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:47,999
Scott: And it's like, you know, the new people are going to come in and start reading it and other people are going to stop reading it.

387
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,440
Scott: And there are the fanboys who keep reading it no matter what.

388
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,959
Scott: But there are a lot of half fanboys who, you know, they can, they change what they do.

389
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,200
Scott: Maybe they'll stop buying one comic, start buying another.

390
00:19:58,641 --> 00:20:00,060
Scott: You know, they're buying, they're going to buy a comic.

391
00:20:00,642 --> 00:20:02,840
Scott: But what comic they buy is up in the air, right?

392
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:06,893
Rym: I do think the loser in all this in the long run, though, will be the comic book stores.

393
00:20:06,934 --> 00:20:07,400
Scott: Oh, definitely.

394
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,619
Scott: Comic book stores lose no matter what.

395
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:11,100
Rym: The thing is, comic book stores and gaming stores are in the same boot.

396
00:20:11,282 --> 00:20:11,970
Rym: In that boat.

397
00:20:12,355 --> 00:20:12,760
Rym: Das Boot.

398
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,840
Rym: In that neither one of them is getting the presence it used to, partly because people are buying stuff online.

399
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,420
Rym: Yeah, you can't buy board games digitally.

400
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:20,940
Rym: But you know what?

401
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,699
Rym: Amazon is cheaper than any gaming store I've ever been into.

402
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,203
Rym: Yeah.

403
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:24,579
Scott: And you know what?

404
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,519
Scott: What if, you know, if Wii U was something that you were going to buy?

405
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,480
Scott: We'll talk about Wii U and some Tuesday in the future.

406
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:30,264
Rym: Oh, Wii U.

407
00:20:30,404 --> 00:20:33,260
Scott: And what if there were actual real board games on Wii U?

408
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,140
Scott: Would that hurt sales of physical board games?

409
00:20:36,342 --> 00:20:38,680
Rym: See, it's hard to say because that's just an example.

410
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,900
Rym: Because board games are kind of the same thing as comics.

411
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:51,260
Rym: The people who care about European style, you know, hardcore German board games are the same kind of nerd, like the same type as the hardcore comic book fans.

412
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:59,160
Scott: All I'm saying is that if they don't want any admonishment from Scott Rubin, what they have to do is they have to make the reset an actual reset.

413
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:06,860
Scott: Throw away all of the history of all of the superheroes and never, ever, ever, ever go back to it.

414
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,180
Scott: Make it completely gone, set on fire.

415
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:14,360
Scott: Not, OK, we'll change the costumes and we'll change some things and keep it familiar.

416
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,960
Scott: No, get rid of it entirely.

417
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,418
Scott: So it never comes back.

418
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,920
Scott: Number two thing they have to do to remove all admonishment.

419
00:21:22,441 --> 00:21:25,000
Scott: Don't charge me three dollars for a fucking digital comic.

420
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,367
Scott: Netflix pricing, right?

421
00:21:26,447 --> 00:21:28,600
Scott: At the current pricing, three dollars a comic.

422
00:21:28,981 --> 00:21:29,645
Rym: Oh, duh.

423
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:35,640
Rym: If there was a Netflix of comics, you just subscribe to Spider-Man for twelve bucks a year or whatever.

424
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:36,102
Rym: Yup.

425
00:21:36,724 --> 00:21:40,580
Scott: For even if I wait and buy these digital comics at two dollars each.

426
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,201
Scott: Fuck it.

427
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:46,320
Scott: If they have fifty two titles, I would pay ten bucks a month, one hundred and twenty dollars a year.

428
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:53,872
Scott: If that meant that I could read every DC comic ever, whenever I wanted it, any device ever with no DRMs, I would pay one hundred and twenty dollars a year.

429
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:54,459
Scott: And you know what?

430
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:56,111
Scott: I'm paying them zero right now.

431
00:21:56,454 --> 00:21:57,320
Scott: That's one hundred and twenty.

432
00:21:57,461 --> 00:21:58,180
Rym: I'd go a little further.

433
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,739
Scott: It doesn't cost them anything because they're only giving me digital copies, which cost them nothing.

434
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:08,499
Scott: Now, if I were that many people would pay that one hundred and twenty dollars, I guarantee at least a million people would pay one hundred and twenty dollars a year.

435
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,159
Scott: That's a hundred and twenty million dollars a year.

436
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:26,360
Rym: And I would basically what I would do is, you know, the new comics, I'll go into this, but I'd make the price a little a lot higher, maybe double, triple, but I'd sell it on digitizing the entire backlog and putting all of those up for free.

437
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,779
Scott: See, I was just talking one hundred and twenty dollars a year for starting at these number ones.

438
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:39,419
Scott: If you're going to give me the entire history of DC Comics, all the way back to Action Comics number one or even earlier and all the new stuff, I pay two, three hundred a year.

439
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:46,620
Scott: If that meant always have all the access to everything forever, you know, like that forever, forever.

440
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,283
Scott: Yes.

441
00:22:47,564 --> 00:22:50,160
Scott: Unless I don't pay my three hundred dollars, then you can cut me off.

442
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,075
Scott: But you know the point.

443
00:22:51,116 --> 00:22:51,279
Scott: Right.

444
00:22:51,981 --> 00:22:53,031
Scott: But yeah, they need to do that.

445
00:22:53,112 --> 00:22:53,920
Scott: Then I'll be impressed.

446
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,740
Rym: So speaking of comic book shops being driven out of business, Kevin Smith wants to do something and I'm going to quote the article.

447
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,017
Scott: He owns some comic shops, doesn't he?

448
00:23:01,602 --> 00:23:05,360
Rym: So he wants to do, and it looks like he is doing, they did a casting call.

449
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,059
Rym: Everything's pretty much going along.

450
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,890
Rym: Reality show.

451
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:09,679
Scott: You mean game show?

452
00:23:10,281 --> 00:23:11,559
Rym: About a comic book store.

453
00:23:11,882 --> 00:23:12,188
Scott: All right.

454
00:23:12,229 --> 00:23:12,740
Scott: What's it about?

455
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:17,220
Rym: The day to day goings on of a comic book store.

456
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:17,845
Scott: Oh, so it's not.

457
00:23:17,905 --> 00:23:19,160
Scott: it is actually a reality show.

458
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:22,320
Scott: It's just going to be like, watch what happens in this comic book store.

459
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:22,742
Rym: Yeah.

460
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:24,340
Rym: Watch what happens in this comic book store.

461
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,543
Rym: Now, I can I can spoil the first season of this because I've been in comic book stores.

462
00:23:28,925 --> 00:23:30,880
Rym: It's mostly very quiet.

463
00:23:31,101 --> 00:23:34,120
Scott: But but the thing is, it's going to be his comic book store probably.

464
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:34,442
Scott: Right.

465
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:35,960
Scott: Which is actually a pretty nice shop.

466
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:36,321
Scott: Yes.

467
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:38,540
Scott: It's sort of like, yeah, it's sort of like Midtown Comics.

468
00:23:38,662 --> 00:23:38,804
Scott: Right.

469
00:23:38,824 --> 00:23:39,413
Scott: It's very nice.

470
00:23:39,697 --> 00:23:39,839
Scott: Yeah.

471
00:23:40,365 --> 00:23:41,200
Scott: Or Forbidden Planet.

472
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,529
Rym: You've been to Midtown Comics.

473
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,800
Rym: What's usually going on in there?

474
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:48,020
Rym: It's quiet and there's like 20 nerds looking at stuff quietly.

475
00:23:49,181 --> 00:23:49,463
Scott: Yeah.

476
00:23:49,523 --> 00:23:51,659
Scott: But the thing is, because this is going to be a TV show.

477
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,646
Scott: Yeah, they're going to get.

478
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:56,559
Rym: they're going to get personalities in there and they're going to get them to argue about stuff and do, you know.

479
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,639
Scott: Plus, nerds will go in there intentionally thinking they're going to be on TV.

480
00:24:00,102 --> 00:24:00,604
Rym: Of course.

481
00:24:00,664 --> 00:24:03,820
Scott: And when this event's like a free comic book day, stuff will happen.

482
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,226
Rym: I'm just I'm not there.

483
00:24:05,286 --> 00:24:07,140
Scott: Imagine gathering tournaments.

484
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,460
Rym: I'm not feeling this too much.

485
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,740
Scott: Plus, they're going to stage a lot of things to happen in there.

486
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,357
Scott: You know, they'll have creators coming to do signings and they'll be.

487
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:17,750
Scott: they'll talk to people, you know, they'll.

488
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,620
Scott: they'll interview people about what they're buying.

489
00:24:19,701 --> 00:24:22,660
Scott: You could you could do this for 12 episodes, I think.

490
00:24:23,021 --> 00:24:26,780
Rym: The thing is, this would be better off not being on TV, being a YouTube show.

491
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,440
Scott: Actually, there is a web comic if I written by a guy who works in a comic shop.

492
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:39,420
Scott: And basically whenever a customer says something really stupid, he makes a like a one or one panel or three panel comic of whatever stupid thing the customer said.

493
00:24:39,622 --> 00:24:40,980
Scott: It is hilarious.

494
00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:44,460
Scott: I forget what it is, but I'm going to try to find it and get a link out there.

495
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:49,040
Scott: But that is what the the reality show should be.

496
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:59,779
Scott: If you show all the moronic customers saying stupid shit like they say in that comic, that'll be a winner because to actually see the people's faces and to see them saying that while the camera's pointed at them.

497
00:25:00,481 --> 00:25:01,952
Scott: That's awesome.

498
00:25:01,972 --> 00:25:03,040
Scott: That would double the hilarity.

499
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:06,420
Scott: And the comic is already literally, laugh out loud, hilarious.

500
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:11,140
Rym: Now, to quote the article, because this really sums up what this is all about.

501
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,598
Rym: I'm just quoting the last sentence here.

502
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:21,762
Rym: Regardless, it'll be nice to see Smith pushes boundaries and get out of his comfort zone by finally doing a project centering on a couple of dudes making pop culture references.

503
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:27,960
Rym: So I got one more little thing that I just happen to see.

504
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:34,680
Rym: You know, there's this whole foreskin circumcision debate going on, San Diego campaign to ban it and whatever.

505
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,240
Scott: But I'm indifferent on that whole issue.

506
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:36,847
Scott: I abstain.

507
00:25:36,928 --> 00:25:37,740
Rym: Well, I'm not indifferent.

508
00:25:38,102 --> 00:25:39,278
Rym: I'm actually yeah, I'm torn.

509
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,103
Scott: I abstain.

510
00:25:40,184 --> 00:25:42,520
Rym: I'm ambivalent, but weakly ambivalent.

511
00:25:42,821 --> 00:25:51,583
Rym: Yeah, because ambivalent implies, you know, ambivalent that I've got like you like you could be ambivalent by having two very powerful opposing opinions that you can't reconcile.

512
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:56,800
Rym: But in this case, I'm ambivalent in that I have like one weak argument for and like one weak argument against.

513
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,117
Scott: I've got I've got like medium arguments on both sides and they're not.

514
00:26:00,298 --> 00:26:03,580
Scott: they're not principles that I hold very close to, like far away principles.

515
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,120
Rym: So I noticed this article is anti circumcision comic, anti Semitic.

516
00:26:10,621 --> 00:26:14,597
Rym: There's a comic force within it, so there's a comic foreskin man.

517
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:15,664
Rym: that's about this debate.

518
00:26:15,704 --> 00:26:17,560
Rym: I was going to fight to save people's foreskin.

519
00:26:18,421 --> 00:26:26,240
Rym: And this article, you know, I just saw that like the headline and I saw like a first sentence or so of it and I'm like, all right, probably not.

520
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:36,140
Rym: It's probably just pro foreskin and someone's making a leap that, yeah, because a Jewish tradition is to circumcise boys, that obviously it's anti Semitic.

521
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,226
Rym: I mean, yeah, yeah.

522
00:26:37,871 --> 00:26:38,960
Rym: And I was going to brush it off.

523
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:43,059
Rym: So then I click on the article and you know what's on the cover of the second one.

524
00:26:43,761 --> 00:27:01,360
Rym: So here's foreskin man, Aryan, beautiful, blonde hair, chiseled behind him is what I can only describe as the stereotypical Jew with horrible razor blades ready to circumcise a baby against the wishes of the mother.

525
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:04,119
Rym: And there's like the Jewish Hasidic mafia behind him.

526
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:04,749
Scott: So it is.

527
00:27:04,811 --> 00:27:05,138
Scott: So it is.

528
00:27:07,483 --> 00:27:08,125
Scott: Then why is there even a?

529
00:27:08,145 --> 00:27:16,575
Scott: I mean, you know, usually when the title of the article is is X anti Semitic, you expect to see something that's questionable.

530
00:27:16,615 --> 00:27:21,480
Rym: like if a headline ever says is X, Y, that headline is bullshit and that article is bullshit.

531
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,122
Scott: I know.

532
00:27:22,202 --> 00:27:27,340
Scott: But the point is, is except in this case with a headline like that, you would think it would be a questionable situation.

533
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,960
Scott: It's like it's like, huh, is this gay?

534
00:27:31,261 --> 00:27:38,407
Scott: And you open it up and the show tunes and penises and, you know, it's like, gee, no, I don't know.

535
00:27:38,569 --> 00:27:39,559
Scott: But now look at this picture.

536
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,361
Scott: Maybe.

537
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:47,170
Rym: OK, it's it's pretty great.

538
00:27:48,575 --> 00:27:49,789
Rym: So I'll leave it at that.

539
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:50,513
Rym: You know what?

540
00:27:50,915 --> 00:27:53,530
Rym: This comic probably is a little anti Semitic.

541
00:27:54,352 --> 00:28:02,689
Scott: The name of the web comic about the comic book shop, which is still updated as recently as today, is called Our Valued Customers and I will link to it.

542
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,497
Rym: So things of the day, it's, you know, summer.

543
00:28:13,618 --> 00:28:13,739
Rym: ish.

544
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:21,340
Rym: This is right around that time of year when a lot of high school seniors and people like that skip school to go to amusement parks, ride some roller coasters.

545
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:21,902
Rym: Yeah.

546
00:28:22,365 --> 00:28:24,380
Rym: And I thought we'd done a show on roller coasters.

547
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,825
Scott: I thought we did also.

548
00:28:25,845 --> 00:28:30,526
Rym: I could not find it after like 10 minutes of digging around our listeners.

549
00:28:30,567 --> 00:28:31,620
Scott: Go tell us if we did one.

550
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,720
Scott: I have a feeling it might have been a show you recorded and did not post.

551
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,000
Rym: That's possible.

552
00:28:36,561 --> 00:28:36,805
Rym: Yeah.

553
00:28:36,906 --> 00:28:37,779
Rym: Or the search is broken.

554
00:28:39,063 --> 00:28:39,652
Scott: Less likely.

555
00:28:39,957 --> 00:28:40,140
Rym: Yeah.

556
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:46,423
Rym: So, you know, we were talking to in the forum recently about geekeries that you grow out of.

557
00:28:46,504 --> 00:28:47,680
Rym: And there's a whole debate there.

558
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:55,940
Rym: But one geekery I kind of grew out of, partly just because I am an adult and have access to much more exciting and worldly things because I have more money.

559
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:02,200
Rym: But when I was a kid, you know, middle school, high school, I was a suit like I would consider myself a roller coaster nerd.

560
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,560
Rym: Like I knew the intimate motherfucking details about roller coasters.

561
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,646
Rym: You take me to Cedar Point.

562
00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:08,720
Rym: I can tell you when the roller coasters were built.

563
00:29:09,022 --> 00:29:14,199
Rym: I can tell you about like, well, that's technically, you know, that's a wooden looking coaster, but technically it's a steel coaster because the rails are like this.

564
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,920
Rym: And yeah, so really into roller coasters.

565
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:26,440
Rym: And I was looking around online trying to figure out, like, all right, it's been about a decade since I've ridden a real roller coaster.

566
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,439
Scott: You got to go to international roller coaster database.

567
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:32,259
Rym: Except for that one roller coaster we rode that one year in Wildwood, which was OK.

568
00:29:33,121 --> 00:29:36,560
Scott: You know, I mean, it was OK for not having ridden a roller coaster in a long time.

569
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:41,939
Rym: It was like a three out of 10 roller coaster that got a plus five bonus for the fact that I had ridden a roller coaster in half a decade.

570
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:42,642
Scott: Yep.

571
00:29:42,662 --> 00:29:49,740
Rym: And minus one hundred bonus from costing ten bucks to ride one minus another one, because remember that year that was when I had Lyme disease and didn't know it yet.

572
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,478
Rym: So I had a wicked headache the whole time.

573
00:29:52,821 --> 00:29:55,260
Scott: It's only minus one, but the ten bucks was more minus.

574
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:55,943
Rym: Yeah.

575
00:29:55,964 --> 00:29:57,538
Rym: Ten bucks back then meant a lot to me.

576
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:07,760
Rym: So my thing of the day is a POV of what I consider to this day, there may be a better roller coaster, at least a better contiguous roller coaster.

577
00:30:08,104 --> 00:30:09,440
Scott: The best roller coaster you've ridden.

578
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:09,900
Rym: Yes.

579
00:30:09,921 --> 00:30:24,240
Rym: Now, I argue this partly because people have made taller and faster roller coasters, but this is a contiguous closed circuit steel coaster as opposed to the kind of BS cheating coaster that's really big, but basically shoots you up one big thing and over it.

580
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:24,863
Rym: And that's it.

581
00:30:24,883 --> 00:30:25,044
Scott: Yeah.

582
00:30:25,064 --> 00:30:28,388
Scott: You know, it's sort of like, you know, it's like a drag, you know, some cars.

583
00:30:28,408 --> 00:30:29,137
Scott: It's funny.

584
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,095
Scott: Isn't the name of that real dragster drag?

585
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,060
Scott: It's like a drag racing car.

586
00:30:33,825 --> 00:30:36,360
Scott: It's like let's make a car that goes straight really fast.

587
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:36,703
Scott: Great.

588
00:30:36,744 --> 00:30:37,480
Scott: But it can't turn.

589
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,619
Scott: An F1 car is much more impressive, right?

590
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:45,141
Scott: Even though it might not have a top speed as high as the drag car, it can turn and it's useful.

591
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:51,800
Rym: But there are many different styles of roller coasters and like wooden coasters and steel coasters and different kinds of steel, whatever.

592
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,600
Rym: But the Millennium Force at Cedar Point is a particular kind of steel coaster.

593
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,940
Rym: A similar coasters would be like the Magnum XL 200, which was also at Cedar Point.

594
00:31:01,381 --> 00:31:12,320
Rym: The steel coaster that has one very tall, very straight hill, and then it has a lot of very high up and downs, not doesn't go upside down and a lot of turn left and rights.

595
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:12,821
Rym: Yep.

596
00:31:12,861 --> 00:31:15,000
Rym: But usually the turn left and right is minimized.

597
00:31:15,261 --> 00:31:19,740
Rym: And the biggest thing is it'll have like three huge hills and rapid succession.

598
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:23,940
Scott: Yeah, maybe it's a combination of hills and turns and banked turns.

599
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:37,080
Rym: Their primary benefits are high top speed, coupled with very strong sideways and top wise Gs, especially at the peak of the second hill of a coaster like this, you'll pretty much like if you don't have your seatbelt on, you're dead.

600
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:37,421
Scott: Yeah.

601
00:31:37,461 --> 00:31:39,900
Scott: Those are my favorite types of roller coasters, hands down.

602
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,019
Rym: Because now I used to be, you know, it's too bad there's no YouTube.

603
00:31:42,241 --> 00:31:43,579
Scott: I actually want a really good one.

604
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:48,124
Scott: It's not as high or as fast, but there is a Superman roller coaster at Six Flags New England.

605
00:31:48,165 --> 00:31:49,099
Rym: I've heard Superman's OK.

606
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,285
Scott: It is it is quite good.

607
00:31:50,305 --> 00:31:51,852
Scott: It's about 100 feet less than the Millennium Force.

608
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:53,800
Scott: So

609
00:31:53,820 --> 00:32:10,497
Rym: the Millennium Force has been voted so many times by various kind of international and national roller coaster organizations as the best steel coaster in the world that I find it hard for anyone to argue to me that there is, in fact, a better roller coaster, at least a better contiguous closed loop steel rail coaster, which

610
00:32:10,557 --> 00:32:11,200
Scott: is my favorite kind.

611
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:11,640
Rym: Yes.

612
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:17,063
Rym: So the Millennium Force POV, if anyone knows of a better coaster, I dare you to tell me.

613
00:32:17,225 --> 00:32:18,156
Scott: Yeah, there are higher there.

614
00:32:18,721 --> 00:32:19,245
Scott: Look at this.

615
00:32:19,548 --> 00:32:20,980
Scott: But they do not have as much action.

616
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,979
Rym: When this was built, it was the tallest and fastest roller coaster in the world.

617
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:25,782
Rym: Yeah.

618
00:32:26,022 --> 00:32:34,659
Rym: And when it was built, its third peak, the third highest part of it was taller than the Magnum XL two hundred's highest peak.

619
00:32:36,161 --> 00:32:40,472
Rym: Yeah, it's a pretty damn good coaster is to this day the longest steel roller coaster in the world as well.

620
00:32:40,656 --> 00:32:40,798
Rym: Yeah.

621
00:32:41,282 --> 00:32:42,798
Scott: So I got a really good thing today.

622
00:32:43,282 --> 00:32:43,565
Scott: You do?

623
00:32:43,748 --> 00:32:44,051
Scott: Yeah.

624
00:32:44,071 --> 00:32:44,780
Scott: It's hockey related.

625
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,660
Scott: So we tend to look down on people who are sort of the drunken frat guys.

626
00:32:50,021 --> 00:32:55,346
Rym: Only because, you know, the only reason I ever looked down on someone like that because you're fucking loud.

627
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:58,040
Scott: But they're also pretty much the opposite of geeks.

628
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:58,560
Scott: Right.

629
00:32:59,003 --> 00:33:08,660
Rym: But at least these guys, how do you know they're not geeks like they're really into how you know, they're not at home with like three different red solo cups, like training and practicing because beer pong.

630
00:33:09,061 --> 00:33:14,424
Scott: If this game of beer pong odds are one guy is actually a beer pong geek and the other guys are just want to get drunk.

631
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:19,003
Scott: And, you know, you could be a getting drunk geek, but you know what?

632
00:33:19,084 --> 00:33:21,319
Scott: If you're doing it with Bud Light, you're not a getting drunk geek.

633
00:33:22,302 --> 00:33:24,239
Rym: No, you're getting drunk geek, but you're not a beer geek.

634
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,759
Scott: That's like saying you're a video game geek and all you ever play is Mario.

635
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:32,249
Rym: You're not even getting drunk geek because getting drunk geeks know that Vodak is the way to go.

636
00:33:32,371 --> 00:33:32,780
Scott: I know that.

637
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,599
Scott: Or perhaps gin.

638
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:41,585
Scott: The point is, here is an epic tale of some hockey Canadian hockey geeks who are fans of the Vancouver Canucks.

639
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:44,320
Scott: This is one of the most epic tales I've ever read.

640
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,100
Scott: It involves, I'm not going to tell you the story because then what's the point?

641
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,880
Scott: You have to read it for yourself to get the full effect.

642
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,999
Scott: But it involves, right, a one thousand mile road trip from Vancouver to L.A.

643
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,120
Scott: to see a hockey game or San Jose to see a hockey game.

644
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:58,461
Scott: Sorry.

645
00:33:58,681 --> 00:34:16,760
Scott: The Sharks and Jose getting so drunk, you end up in the hospital drinking some of those alcoholic beverages with the owner of the Canucks and his hot ladies going back to Vancouver, escaping the hospital and many other epic things happening.

646
00:34:17,862 --> 00:34:20,239
Scott: It is so epic and it's all true.

647
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,639
Scott: One hundred percent true photo evidence, not Snopes, not bullshit.

648
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,960
Scott: It really happened, as is told in this article.

649
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,228
Scott: One hundred percent.

650
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:29,300
Scott: I confirmed it.

651
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,108
Scott: It's for real.

652
00:34:30,715 --> 00:34:31,120
Scott: It's awesome.

653
00:34:31,521 --> 00:34:35,806
Rym: It's the kind of thing that you'd see in a movie and you would be like, oh, that's a stupid movie.

654
00:34:35,846 --> 00:34:36,699
Rym: It's like contrived.

655
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,739
Scott: Similar things have happened to us.

656
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:50,280
Scott: You know, it's like, oh, remember that, you know, when we were driving back from Otakon and we needed to get off the highway in the dark to get gas, you know, and like, this is like one of those stories times a hundred.

657
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,800
Rym: Our midget hookers playing settlers really doesn't even come close.

658
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,219
Scott: It's like that times 20.

659
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:56,322
Scott: Right.

660
00:34:56,382 --> 00:34:57,159
Scott: It's that awesome.

661
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,960
Scott: So check out this story of epic epicness.

662
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,404
Rym: So in the meta moment, the GeekNights Book Club book is still Isaac Asimov's foundation.

663
00:35:04,464 --> 00:35:08,019
Rym: The unofficial book club book is still all of the R. Scout Backer, Prince of Nothing books.

664
00:35:08,581 --> 00:35:10,920
Rym: We will not be at Otakon because they didn't invite us back.

665
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:12,597
Rym: So you can tell them if you want us to be there.

666
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,219
Rym: PEX will be at Connecticut is coming up.

667
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,778
Rym: We'll be there running the panel's department.

668
00:35:19,942 --> 00:35:20,689
Scott: E-commerce room.

669
00:35:21,012 --> 00:35:21,920
Rym: that's coming along.

670
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:22,404
Scott: We're pretty sure.

671
00:35:22,424 --> 00:35:23,980
Scott: you said you were going to mail the things tomorrow.

672
00:35:24,161 --> 00:35:24,723
Scott: Oh, yeah.

673
00:35:24,844 --> 00:35:28,521
Rym: Oh, and the only new update on the e-commerce is that we're almost out of shirts.

674
00:35:29,205 --> 00:35:33,397
Scott: But I thought you said after a previous show that you were going to mail something the following day.

675
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:33,599
Rym: Yeah.

676
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:34,368
Scott: Did you do that?

677
00:35:34,408 --> 00:35:34,651
Rym: Yeah.

678
00:35:35,036 --> 00:35:35,218
Scott: Oh, OK.

679
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:35,804
Scott: What do you?

680
00:35:36,068 --> 00:35:36,959
Rym: that's why it's not a news.

681
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,040
Scott: I'm just verifying that you mailed like you said you would.

682
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,149
Scott: There was a non shit talk.

683
00:35:41,189 --> 00:35:42,560
Scott: That is a news when it comes to RIV.

684
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:43,532
Scott: A non shit talk.

685
00:35:43,613 --> 00:35:44,160
Scott: Oh, my gosh.

686
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:47,922
Rym: Speaking of non shit talks, you might have noticed we launched a new spin off front row.

687
00:35:47,962 --> 00:35:50,960
Rym: Crew GeekNights show called Radio Free Equestria.

688
00:35:51,922 --> 00:35:59,319
Rym: It is about nothing but my little pony friendship is magic and the intimate Gandalf girthings that are going on there in.

689
00:35:59,661 --> 00:35:59,802
Rym: Yep.

690
00:36:00,346 --> 00:36:04,239
Rym: I think it's a pretty good show, actually, and it's going to go up pretty much weekly for a while, at least pilots.

691
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,452
Scott: Brony seemed to like it.

692
00:36:05,818 --> 00:36:05,939
Rym: Yep.

693
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,800
Scott: Well, I was I was worried.

694
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,980
Scott: I was you know, I didn't know what the reaction was going to be, but Brony's actually were excited for more.

695
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,564
Scott: I was like, really?

696
00:36:12,664 --> 00:36:12,966
Scott: OK.

697
00:36:13,007 --> 00:36:14,960
Rym: The reaction was pretty overwhelming, actually.

698
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:15,605
Scott: From Brony's.

699
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:15,909
Scott: Yeah.

700
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:16,820
Scott: I don't know about normal people.

701
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:21,924
Rym: We have more list, more viewers of this at its start than GeekNights had for like the first year.

702
00:36:22,205 --> 00:36:25,440
Scott: Well, you know, it's it's a targeted community effort.

703
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,021
Rym: Yeah.

704
00:36:26,042 --> 00:36:27,760
Rym: We got to do more targeted community efforts.

705
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,100
Scott: Well, that was always the strategy.

706
00:36:29,201 --> 00:36:31,640
Scott: We just haven't found enough communities that are ripe for targeting.

707
00:36:32,101 --> 00:36:38,599
Rym: So to put another thing out there, like I said before, there is a another a third thing that we are working on.

708
00:36:39,002 --> 00:36:40,932
Rym: I don't know when it'll be up, but it's it's coming.

709
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:47,780
Rym: We have a third show unrelated to ponies and not directly related to GeekNights that will also be on YouTube.

710
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:51,880
Rym: So keep an eye out on my YouTube channel, GeekNights Rym.

711
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,279
Rym: So we got two shows for you, but one of them we haven't seen a lot of.

712
00:36:56,641 --> 00:37:01,240
Rym: And we're going to talk about fairly briefly, just because it's something kind of different and cute and neat.

713
00:37:01,341 --> 00:37:04,400
Rym: And we're always a big fan of those kind of short, cute anime.

714
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:13,587
Scott: Yeah, we're big on the the animes that are, you know, made up a lot of short tiny episodes like Damakoto and such, because it doesn't take that much effort to watch them.

715
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,739
Scott: And if you have a short attention span, you can totally burn through it really quick.

716
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:19,459
Scott: And, you know, risky safety really got us hooked.

717
00:37:20,222 --> 00:37:20,322
Rym: Yeah.

718
00:37:20,342 --> 00:37:23,820
Rym: So Hippyra, the little vampire, or I guess vampire.

719
00:37:24,783 --> 00:37:25,719
Scott: Yeah, it's not.

720
00:37:26,441 --> 00:37:31,920
Scott: You know, I know vampires are a thing lately, but it, you know, which sort of, you know, it's annoying like, oh, another vampire thing.

721
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,299
Rym: Oh, you're mad because someone else likes something.

722
00:37:35,062 --> 00:37:37,120
Rym: This bothers you that someone else is a fan of something.

723
00:37:37,401 --> 00:37:41,022
Scott: No, I'm just saying it's like, you know, when they're seen, there was like a zombie.

724
00:37:41,103 --> 00:37:43,560
Rym: Vampires were cool before other people were into.

725
00:37:43,921 --> 00:37:47,060
Scott: No, I'm just saying there was a zombie glut and then there was a vampire glut.

726
00:37:47,261 --> 00:37:50,036
Scott: And it's and it's like, well, you would you would think, oh, it's.

727
00:37:50,137 --> 00:37:55,520
Scott: you think, right, maybe if there's another when any new thing comes out during a glut.

728
00:37:55,681 --> 00:37:55,862
Scott: Right.

729
00:37:55,902 --> 00:38:00,997
Scott: And it wasn't the thing that inspired the glut or kicked it off like Walking Dead kicked off the zombie glut.

730
00:38:01,138 --> 00:38:01,340
Scott: Right.

731
00:38:01,741 --> 00:38:04,720
Scott: But so a lot of other things just came in from the side.

732
00:38:05,122 --> 00:38:08,020
Scott: And it's like, OK, obviously you didn't put a lot of effort into this.

733
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,559
Scott: You're just trying to ride the wave.

734
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,586
Scott: So you would think a new vampire thing coming out in a vampire glut is just trying to ride the wave.

735
00:38:14,606 --> 00:38:17,780
Scott: But you'd be skeptical that it actually has merit.

736
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,323
Rym: There's one thing that makes this kind of stand out, a little one tidbit that you might not notice.

737
00:38:22,846 --> 00:38:25,940
Rym: The story is done by one Katsuhiro Otomo.

738
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,069
Scott: Oh, the Akira guy?

739
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,179
Rym: Yeah, the Akira guy.

740
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,200
Scott: Yes, he just wrote the story, though he didn't animate it or anything else.

741
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:42,179
Rym: It was directed by some other guy, not a huge cast of people working on it, because it's a short, cute little show about a little vampire boy in a place where the sun never rises.

742
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,146
Scott: Yeah, basically it's.

743
00:38:44,266 --> 00:38:46,959
Scott: it's a vampire town named like Salta.

744
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:47,481
Scott: Right.

745
00:38:48,287 --> 00:38:49,980
Scott: And he's a cute little vampire guy.

746
00:38:50,221 --> 00:38:51,719
Scott: He lives in the cute little vampire town.

747
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,706
Scott: All the little vampires.

748
00:38:52,726 --> 00:39:03,480
Rym: He has a friend that's a soul because one of his one of the adults in the village collected hundreds of thousands of human souls and tried to mash them together into something he could bite so he could go to hell, because hell is heaven for vampires.

749
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,167
Scott: That's right.

750
00:39:04,329 --> 00:39:04,999
Rym: And he fucked it up.

751
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,240
Rym: And one little leg of his soul popped out and is hanging around with Hippy Ra.

752
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:08,922
Scott: Yep.

753
00:39:09,689 --> 00:39:10,840
Rym: And there's not much else to say.

754
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,780
Rym: It's just kind of cute, goonie.

755
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,145
Scott: And yeah, it's not.

756
00:39:14,225 --> 00:39:21,360
Scott: it's usually the shows that are really short like this have just really intense, strong jokes.

757
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:25,446
Scott: They they come hitting hard with the comedy nonstop because they've only got like five minutes.

758
00:39:25,527 --> 00:39:26,900
Rym: This is more slice of life.

759
00:39:27,143 --> 00:39:28,380
Scott: Yeah, this is a little quieter.

760
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,699
Rym: I guess slice of death.

761
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,833
Scott: It's like, yeah, undeath.

762
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,660
Scott: But it's like cute, funny.

763
00:39:32,841 --> 00:39:33,042
Scott: Right.

764
00:39:33,082 --> 00:39:37,220
Scott: And all the funniness is just like seeing how the cute vampire world works.

765
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,020
Scott: It's like, oh, I got myself some blood orange juice.

766
00:39:40,202 --> 00:39:41,779
Scott: It's like, lol, blood orange juice.

767
00:39:42,343 --> 00:39:43,376
Scott: OK, it's cute.

768
00:39:44,463 --> 00:39:46,240
Scott: Oh, we got to take biting lessons in school.

769
00:39:46,461 --> 00:39:47,919
Rym: I love taking biting lessons.

770
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,479
Scott: You know, it's stuff like that.

771
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:55,220
Rym: It's not like or like the subway pulls up and there's some people sitting and then there's some people who are bats hanging from the straps.

772
00:39:55,563 --> 00:39:57,400
Scott: Yeah, it's all environmental.

773
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,260
Scott: Like what would happen in a friendly vampire town?

774
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:00,641
Scott: Funny.

775
00:40:00,681 --> 00:40:04,180
Scott: It's not like Domic Adobutu where they come hitting hard with drunk unicorns.

776
00:40:04,881 --> 00:40:05,185
Rym: Right.

777
00:40:05,226 --> 00:40:06,119
Rym: Drunk unicorns.

778
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,759
Rym: It's just sort of, you know, someone's got to mash up My Little Pony and Domic Adobutu.

779
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:11,884
Scott: Not a bad choice.

780
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:15,220
Scott: But anyway, you know, the show is really short.

781
00:40:15,823 --> 00:40:17,559
Scott: It's all CG, but it's pretty good.

782
00:40:18,142 --> 00:40:21,280
Scott: But the download, the quality of the downloads hurts it quite a bit.

783
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,679
Scott: You have to find in higher resolution downloads than we had.

784
00:40:24,164 --> 00:40:25,618
Scott: But then again, the Mac Mini was pretty weak.

785
00:40:26,241 --> 00:40:26,969
Rym: Yeah, Cor Solo.

786
00:40:27,313 --> 00:40:27,880
Rym: You can find it.

787
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,302
Rym: It's cute.

788
00:40:28,402 --> 00:40:36,320
Rym: But our main topic tonight is the thing that, you know, after ponies ended in the Fur Roku forum, there's about how many thousand posts in that thread.

789
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,220
Rym: But there's one other thread that's been kind of plugging along.

790
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,579
Rym: There's like a hundred posts in it about wakfu.

791
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,423
Scott: So I'm like, hey, there's a show that I've never heard of that has all these posts in a thread.

792
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:48,099
Scott: I mean, maybe it's worth checking out.

793
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:52,007
Rym: On GeekNights a while ago, because I've been watching it with Emily and I've seen a decent amount of it.

794
00:40:52,229 --> 00:40:53,360
Scott: I've seen three or four episodes.

795
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:54,250
Rym: It's OK.

796
00:40:54,818 --> 00:40:55,020
Scott: Yeah.

797
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,780
Scott: I mean, like people made a thread about it.

798
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,120
Scott: So I said, oh, I got to check that out to see what the deal is.

799
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:03,080
Scott: So I checked it out and I was like, you know, I was like, well, it wasn't bad.

800
00:41:03,201 --> 00:41:06,039
Scott: But why are people getting so incredibly excited about it?

801
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,600
Rym: Are they getting so incredibly excited about it?

802
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,203
Rym: I don't think they are.

803
00:41:08,223 --> 00:41:13,540
Rym: I think they're excited about it at the same level that, say, people are like when we're watching Slayers way back.

804
00:41:13,922 --> 00:41:15,779
Rym: We just, oh, let's watch some more Slayers.

805
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,399
Scott: Yeah, but Slayers is way better than wakfu.

806
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,900
Rym: Yeah, but they're similar genre at least.

807
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:23,020
Scott: They are similar in genre.

808
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:26,020
Rym: Is one of those like might as well be a game?

809
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,239
Rym: Oh, well, it is a game, but we'll skip that for now.

810
00:41:28,781 --> 00:41:36,920
Rym: It's basically a generic JRPG style plot of a hero and his party going on adventures in a world that is surprisingly video game like.

811
00:41:37,705 --> 00:41:37,867
Scott: Yeah.

812
00:41:37,908 --> 00:41:38,557
Scott: So here's the deal.

813
00:41:38,598 --> 00:41:38,740
Scott: Right.

814
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,496
Scott: There was a game called Dofus, which is a Flash based MMO.

815
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,580
Rym: It's the thing that Scott never noticed at all the gaming cons.

816
00:41:47,023 --> 00:41:48,271
Scott: Yeah.

817
00:41:49,097 --> 00:41:49,439
Scott: And then.

818
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:50,002
Scott: Right.

819
00:41:50,062 --> 00:41:53,580
Scott: And that Dofus game had some sort of world that they created for.

820
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,003
Scott: Right.

821
00:41:54,023 --> 00:41:55,320
Scott: So Wakfu was another.

822
00:41:56,481 --> 00:42:00,040
Scott: It was basically Wakfu is an MMO Final Fantasy Tactics game.

823
00:42:00,221 --> 00:42:00,524
Scott: Right.

824
00:42:00,766 --> 00:42:02,520
Scott: That was in the same world as Dofus.

825
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:04,700
Scott: So there's a video game that created a world.

826
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,980
Scott: Then there was another video game, Wakfu, that took place in the same world.

827
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:08,501
Scott: Right.

828
00:42:08,844 --> 00:42:10,860
Scott: So he's the same universe for two video games.

829
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:15,699
Scott: And then what we're talking about today is an animated series based on.

830
00:42:16,141 --> 00:42:16,423
Scott: Right.

831
00:42:16,483 --> 00:42:20,180
Scott: The Wakfu game, which is placed in the same world as the Dofus game.

832
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:29,281
Scott: So the first season of 26 episodes began airing in '08, according to Wikipedia, and new episodes continued into January 2010.

833
00:42:29,281 --> 00:42:30,046
Scott: And it's French.

834
00:42:30,388 --> 00:42:30,831
Scott: That's the thing.

835
00:42:30,872 --> 00:42:32,080
Scott: is all this stuff is French.

836
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,205
Scott: Right.

837
00:42:33,225 --> 00:42:35,440
Scott: The video games, all this stuff were made by French people.

838
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,119
Scott: I think Square Enix actually is helping them publish.

839
00:42:39,582 --> 00:42:47,640
Scott: All of the production for the TV show was done in Flash in France, except for I think two episodes are done in Japan, whatever that kind of stuff.

840
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,485
Scott: Isn't that important?

841
00:42:50,338 --> 00:42:50,640
Scott: But yeah.

842
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,937
Scott: And they're coming out with a season two.

843
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:56,640
Scott: So the thing that's really impressive about the show is that it's all done in Flash.

844
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:01,200
Scott: My Little Pony is also all done in Flash, but My Little Pony looks really impressive.

845
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:06,200
Scott: Wakfu, if you just look at still shots, looks way more impressive than My Little Pony.

846
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,259
Scott: It's like you look at My Little Pony and you're like, oh, my God, that's the best thing, the highest quality Flash animation I've ever seen.

847
00:43:12,942 --> 00:43:21,920
Scott: But Wakfu is even better, except for the fact that he's personally, while the art and visual imagery is way better than ponies.

848
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,740
Scott: I actually think the animation, the movement is a little jerky.

849
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:34,993
Rym: Well, there's two things going on, because I've noticed it's like 50/50 some aspects of the animation, especially when there's some sort of CG thing like flying by action, action, super well animated.

850
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:44,519
Rym: But when when a character is like turned into another character to talk, it's it's like they they're like it's almost like stop motion like it.

851
00:43:45,862 --> 00:43:50,720
Scott: Yeah, it's strange, like for action scenes or fighting or casting magic spells or anything like that.

852
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,419
Scott: The animation is super awesome.

853
00:43:52,561 --> 00:43:54,300
Scott: And it's like, whoa, this is really done in Flash.

854
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,579
Scott: You shitting me, right?

855
00:43:55,981 --> 00:44:00,319
Scott: You'd expect them to use, you know, whatever they use for like, you know, all the other digitally animated shows.

856
00:44:01,524 --> 00:44:03,560
Rym: But Flash is surprisingly used more often than you think.

857
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,060
Scott: Yeah, but when somebody is just sitting there talking like their head, it moves in weird sort of jerky ways.

858
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,599
Rym: Well, it moves exactly the way you see characters move in JRPGs.

859
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:13,341
Scott: Yeah.

860
00:44:13,361 --> 00:44:23,460
Scott: Or the way that like people move in like old crappy FMV's and old PlayStation video games or really old CG movies that were done really poorly before technology was good.

861
00:44:23,982 --> 00:44:27,660
Scott: And, you know, but it's only the movement like the character still looks amazing.

862
00:44:28,243 --> 00:44:34,040
Scott: It's just the movement of the character in the scenes where they're just talking is often kind of weird.

863
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,099
Scott: It's almost like uncanny valley, but not I don't know.

864
00:44:37,664 --> 00:44:42,219
Rym: So it follows the plot of a young boy named Hugo, who has the portal gun in his hands.

865
00:44:43,345 --> 00:44:43,466
Rym: Yep.

866
00:44:43,486 --> 00:44:45,360
Rym: And is the descendant of dragons or something.

867
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,560
Rym: We don't know what the deal is, but it opens.

868
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,099
Scott: He's the magical mystery dude.

869
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:49,521
Rym: There's.

870
00:44:49,541 --> 00:45:00,140
Rym: there's definitely some homage because the whole show opens right with like a flash of magic in this village, this random village and this lone wolf and cub looking duo walks out of it.

871
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:00,540
Rym: Yeah.

872
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:04,939
Rym: Just guy who looks super dangerous pushing a carriage with a baby in it.

873
00:45:05,782 --> 00:45:10,380
Rym: And something attacks him and he totally kicks its ass because he's lone wolf.

874
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,100
Rym: I guess he's a dragon.

875
00:45:12,741 --> 00:45:15,740
Rym: And the thing that attacks him is like, oh, he's so full of walk through.

876
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:16,514
Rym: I want to eat it.

877
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:21,579
Scott: You know, walk through is like the generic life energy that everyone, you know, the bad guys want to collect.

878
00:45:22,001 --> 00:45:26,800
Scott: And, you know, as an aside, this show and the bad guy is some sort of walk through powered robot who can travel.

879
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,699
Rym: Definitely some sort of precursor technology situation going on in this world.

880
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,299
Rym: I love shit like that.

881
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:33,642
Scott: Yeah.

882
00:45:34,045 --> 00:45:36,180
Rym: But there's this maybe magic tech.

883
00:45:37,302 --> 00:45:42,354
Rym: They like the Prince of Nothing has a lot of proper nouns, made up gobbledygook, proper noun.

884
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:43,000
Rym: that's just there.

885
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,458
Rym: You know, that's high, don't you?

886
00:45:44,841 --> 00:45:53,538
Scott: And then, you know, the difference between the nursery and the in the in the Keonene Beach of a wookie chigra.

887
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:54,020
Scott: Right.

888
00:45:54,601 --> 00:46:02,760
Rym: But and I understand more French than I expected watching this because it's in French and French is something I studied in like high school.

889
00:46:02,882 --> 00:46:03,632
Rym: And at RIT.

890
00:46:03,652 --> 00:46:03,875
Rym: Yeah.

891
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:10,300
Rym: But I'm hampered by the fact that they use a lot of silly made up proper nouns.

892
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:15,780
Scott: And, you know, I've noticed a lot of them are very Marduk and Gardakhan.

893
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:16,688
Scott: Have you noticed that?

894
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:17,051
Rym: Marduk.

895
00:46:17,313 --> 00:46:17,899
Scott: Yeah, they are.

896
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:24,379
Scott: That's hilarious for me because of because of that other the names to Princess Amalia Charan-Charmes.

897
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,478
Rym: Sir Sedleygrove Persedal.

898
00:46:30,363 --> 00:46:31,219
Scott: And Senor Gardakhan.

899
00:46:32,381 --> 00:46:33,578
Scott: Rubillax and Boba Fett.

900
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:38,977
Scott: Anyway, but yeah, the thing is, you know, it's not it's.

901
00:46:39,017 --> 00:46:39,720
Scott: you know, it's not bad.

902
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,057
Scott: It's like, hey, it's it's a fantasy plot, right?

903
00:46:42,137 --> 00:46:42,460
Scott: It's fun.

904
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:42,802
Rym: It's cute.

905
00:46:42,822 --> 00:46:45,179
Rym: The main character totally just goes for it.

906
00:46:45,401 --> 00:46:48,800
Scott: But it's so generic in its fantasy plot.

907
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,322
Scott: Is it like?

908
00:46:49,362 --> 00:46:55,340
Scott: it doesn't have anything special that makes it stand out above all the other JRPG fantasy plots in the universe.

909
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,259
Rym: Characters are all fun.

910
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:00,420
Rym: Like I like the individual characters, but they're not great characters, at least not yet.

911
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:03,779
Rym: I've seen a lot of episodes, but it doesn't grab me as much as other things have grabbed me.

912
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:14,400
Scott: It's like what makes this JRPG story better or different than a JRPG story from any Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy, Valkyrie profile, Xenogears, Chrono Trigger story?

913
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:18,100
Rym: Of course, it does get points for being very JRPG.

914
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:23,960
Rym: Like early on when they're good, they go to the shop to try to buy a, quote, world map.

915
00:47:24,521 --> 00:47:26,079
Scott: Yeah, the map is pretty cool.

916
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:29,460
Rym: And actually, I like that episode because one, the cat girl and her husband were pretty funny.

917
00:47:29,928 --> 00:47:30,520
Scott: Yeah, they were right.

918
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,259
Rym: And while the twist at the end was pretty obvious at the same time.

919
00:47:34,725 --> 00:47:35,640
Scott: It was Captain Obvious.

920
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,719
Rym: It was also kind of funny.

921
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:37,693
Scott: It was OK.

922
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:42,620
Rym: Though the way it resolved at the end when he's like, how do you think I'm going to keep getting stuff for the shop?

923
00:47:42,721 --> 00:47:44,056
Rym: And she's like, darling.

924
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:48,232
Scott: Yeah, but the thing is, it's not, you know, it's like.

925
00:47:48,834 --> 00:47:50,380
Scott: it's not like ecstatically funny.

926
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,160
Scott: It's just sort of like ha ha funny, you know, a little bit ha ha.

927
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:53,823
Scott: It's not like.

928
00:47:54,346 --> 00:47:56,760
Scott: it's not like, oh, my God, I need to watch more of this so bad.

929
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:57,120
Scott: Right.

930
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:57,843
Scott: That's how you know.

931
00:47:57,863 --> 00:48:02,220
Scott: when something's good is when you absolutely cannot resist watching the next one.

932
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,948
Rym: I know I often forget that, like because I watched.

933
00:48:04,988 --> 00:48:15,940
Rym: there's this era from like 2003, 2004, when there was we were watching a lot of kind of generic anime because we almost felt obligated to, you know, anime club and everything like scryed and all that shit.

934
00:48:16,621 --> 00:48:25,240
Rym: And I just remember I'd be watching like a lot of anime and it'd be like, it's sure like, oh, no, I'll watch one more episode, then I'll go do something real and something actually fun.

935
00:48:25,961 --> 00:48:30,199
Rym: And then not that long ago, we were hanging out at someone's house a few years ago and maybe a year ago.

936
00:48:31,202 --> 00:48:32,960
Rym: And someone there hadn't seen Cowboy Bebop.

937
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,580
Rym: So like, oh, just put on the first couple episodes.

938
00:48:36,642 --> 00:48:40,400
Rym: And then I thought, oh, I'll half ignore it because I've seen Cowboy Bebop three times.

939
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,320
Rym: I'll just play a board game.

940
00:48:41,741 --> 00:48:47,300
Rym: Now, I watched every second of Cowboy Bebop and desperately wanted to watch all of it immediately.

941
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:47,980
Scott: Yeah.

942
00:48:48,001 --> 00:48:56,780
Scott: You know, Hajime no Ippo, I started, you know, I picked it up because it was in my queue and I burned through it like, you know, I don't know, phosphoric sulfuric acid.

943
00:48:57,061 --> 00:49:00,160
Rym: My little pony, I watched as soon as I could.

944
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:00,941
Scott: Yeah.

945
00:49:00,961 --> 00:49:04,060
Scott: As soon as the new pony episode came out, I was desperate to go and watch it.

946
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,320
Scott: You know, Full Metal Alchemist, when it was coming out, we did that.

947
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:07,962
Rym: Oh, my God.

948
00:49:07,982 --> 00:49:12,080
Rym: When Full Metal Alchemist was coming out, it was like the mad rush to see you could get it first.

949
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:12,701
Scott: Yeah.

950
00:49:12,821 --> 00:49:15,560
Scott: It's like, you know, so that's how, you know, something's really good.

951
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:20,920
Scott: Wakfu, I've watched a handful of episodes and really I would be just fine not watching any more ever.

952
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:22,418
Scott: Like, if one was on, I would watch it.

953
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:23,802
Scott: But it's not like.

954
00:49:23,842 --> 00:49:28,373
Scott: I don't have this desperate need to see more, which puts it, you know, it's like, well, I'll just go to.

955
00:49:28,473 --> 00:49:31,300
Scott: I'll definitely go to something else before I go to Wakfu.

956
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:32,061
Scott: Right.

957
00:49:32,443 --> 00:49:34,315
Scott: Not that it's not bad, but it's just not.

958
00:49:34,617 --> 00:49:35,120
Scott: it's not great.

959
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:35,464
Scott: I don't know.

960
00:49:35,525 --> 00:49:36,499
Scott: It doesn't stand out.

961
00:49:36,621 --> 00:49:37,313
Scott: It's not amazing.

962
00:49:37,333 --> 00:49:37,760
Scott: It's interesting.

963
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,560
Scott: It's just another JRPG plot.

964
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:40,682
Rym: You probably won't be happy.

965
00:49:40,742 --> 00:49:48,179
Rym: It gives me the same level of enjoyment as an individual episode of, say, Fist of the North Star.

966
00:49:49,981 --> 00:49:51,580
Rym: Individual episode for individual episode.

967
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:58,540
Rym: Now, the overall enjoyment of Fist of the North Star is higher because there's this compounding as you watch more episodes.

968
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,261
Scott: That is the thing.

969
00:49:59,301 --> 00:50:07,180
Scott: I think what Wakfu could have done to make me more interested, right, was to actually bring more heat on that initial plot.

970
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:07,680
Scott: Right.

971
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:16,440
Scott: Because it's that typical JRPG stuff where, you know, there's a hidden great power and we give you a hint of it at the beginning and then it's hidden away.

972
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:20,300
Scott: And as the episodes go on, it won't be revealed until the very end.

973
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,285
Scott: And then it will come back.

974
00:50:21,647 --> 00:50:23,719
Scott: You know, every JRPG does that.

975
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:25,687
Scott: And it always bothers me.

976
00:50:25,747 --> 00:50:27,500
Scott: The worst one of those is Luffy.

977
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:28,260
Scott: You ever play Luffy?

978
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:30,380
Rym: I tried to play Luffy.

979
00:50:30,881 --> 00:50:33,816
Scott: At the very beginning of Luffy, you are right.

980
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:39,740
Scott: The great, heroic, epic party of legend in your super high level.

981
00:50:40,001 --> 00:50:43,200
Scott: And you go and you play out basically the legend.

982
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:50,320
Scott: It would be like if there was a pony RPG and level one was like, you are Celestia, use the elements of harmony to stop Nightmare Moon.

983
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:58,360
Scott: And then as soon as you beat that first level, you're like the great, you know, descendant of that party's leader.

984
00:50:59,163 --> 00:51:00,680
Scott: And you're just some punk kid with nothing.

985
00:51:01,064 --> 00:51:02,337
Scott: And it's like, oh, what the fuck?

986
00:51:02,418 --> 00:51:02,620
Scott: Right.

987
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:05,680
Scott: And it takes until the end of the game to get back to the epic shit.

988
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,760
Scott: It's like, give me something that's epic the whole goddamn time, asshole.

989
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,580
Scott: See, look at Fist of the North Star.

990
00:51:10,902 --> 00:51:12,500
Scott: It's epic the whole time.

991
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:19,020
Scott: You don't get to start, you don't see the nuclear war that much, but you see it's always Kenshiro and Kenshiro is the guy.

992
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:19,800
Scott: Right.

993
00:51:19,821 --> 00:51:23,759
Scott: It's not like the real guy was Kenshiro's ancestor and Kenshiro is just sort of...

994
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,340
Rym: See, you don't always need epic.

995
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,288
Rym: Look at Cowboy Bebop.

996
00:51:26,308 --> 00:51:27,540
Rym: There's no epic plot.

997
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,520
Scott: Look, I'm on heroin here.

998
00:51:29,702 --> 00:51:29,904
Scott: Right.

999
00:51:30,005 --> 00:51:31,199
Scott: Your methadone ain't going to work.

1000
00:51:32,944 --> 00:51:34,439
Scott: I need that big shit all the time.

1001
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:35,681
Scott: Right.

1002
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:39,580
Scott: Don't give me the dragon in the first episode and then not give me the dragon in the fourth episode.

1003
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,140
Rym: I want more dragon stuff.

1004
00:51:41,521 --> 00:51:41,762
Scott: Yeah.

1005
00:51:41,802 --> 00:51:48,580
Scott: You know, don't bring out the time shifting bad guy in episode one and two and then hide him away until later.

1006
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:48,881
Scott: Right.

1007
00:51:48,901 --> 00:51:49,465
Scott: Bring him out.

1008
00:51:49,566 --> 00:51:51,479
Scott: I want to, you know, let's see what he's up to.

1009
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:58,280
Rym: But seriously, like if you enjoy shows like Slayers or Goku-Do, you know, any of those...

1010
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,854
Scott: I think it's exactly equal to Goku-Do, I think.

1011
00:52:00,955 --> 00:52:01,800
Scott: That's exactly right.

1012
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:05,480
Rym: Because Goku-Do was a little like it had his great moments, but overall it started to peter out.

1013
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:06,771
Rym: It wasn't quite as good as Slayers.

1014
00:52:07,093 --> 00:52:07,860
Rym: And also, I got to qualify.

1015
00:52:08,021 --> 00:52:08,984
Rym: I really like Slayers.

1016
00:52:09,004 --> 00:52:13,100
Rym: It is a great show, but simultaneously has its problems.

1017
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:14,780
Scott: Slayers is not perfect.

1018
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:24,210
Rym: Slayers actually has a surprising amount of shounen style fighting Dragon Ball Z where people stand there going, "Oh, is he going to use this power?

1019
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:25,138
Rym: Is he going to use that

1020
00:52:25,158 --> 00:52:25,319
Rym: power?".

1021
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,731
Scott: Yeah, but it doesn't last more than an episode.

1022
00:52:27,115 --> 00:52:27,740
Scott: It's within the episode.

1023
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:30,720
Rym: And it always cuts to, you know, someone praying to Zormo Gooster.

1024
00:52:31,383 --> 00:52:32,100
Scott: Yeah, Zormo Gooster.

1025
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:33,240
Rym: I love Zormo Gooster.

1026
00:52:33,863 --> 00:52:34,296
Rym: The best guy.

1027
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,920
Scott: Zormo Gooster is better than all of Wakfu added together.

1028
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:41,439
Rym: Zormo Gooster is pretty much the god of the gods.

1029
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,059
Scott: Zormo Gooster could beat Kenshiro.

1030
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:43,847
Rym: Oh, easily.

1031
00:52:44,234 --> 00:52:44,559
Rym: Easily.

1032
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,940
Rym: But Kenshiro could definitely beat Gov, the Demon Dragon King.

1033
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:49,700
Scott: Well, that's not even a contest.

1034
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:54,360
Rym: In fact, the Demon Dragon King, Gov, is already dead.

1035
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:54,858
Rym: Yep.

1036
00:52:56,241 --> 00:53:01,800
Scott: Anyway, but yeah, if you're the kind of person, you know, because I know those people exist, where it's like you can't get enough of JRPGs.

1037
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:09,180
Scott: Like, a JRPG comes out and you just play it like crazy, you know, and you just get hooked into every old JRPG on the planet or anything with that kind of story.

1038
00:53:09,943 --> 00:53:10,318
Scott: Or, you know.

1039
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:12,720
Rym: Or if you like procedural adventurer drama.

1040
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:17,620
Scott: Yeah, it's like if adventurers are going on a fantasy quest, you just really can't get enough of that.

1041
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,479
Scott: Then you can't get, then Wakfu is another one of those for you.

1042
00:53:21,081 --> 00:53:24,860
Scott: And the best part is you don't have to press A to, you know, to fight random encounters.

1043
00:53:24,941 --> 00:53:25,960
Scott: You just get the story part.

1044
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:35,860
Scott: The only, I think the real weakness of Wakfu is that the characters, they're okay, but they're not like, they're not really strong, you know?

1045
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:38,960
Scott: It's like, they have their personalities, right?

1046
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,220
Scott: But they're not strong personalities in one direction or another, right?

1047
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:47,200
Scott: It's like, this money guy, the main character is really, like, has no personality whatsoever.

1048
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,400
Scott: He's so nothing.

1049
00:53:49,621 --> 00:53:55,240
Scott: You know, there's the, actually the best of the whole main characters is the little sword that the knight has to fight with.

1050
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,080
Scott: Oh, the shabu, I forget what the demons are called.

1051
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,620
Scott: The knight is pretty boring, but his sword is actually pretty cool.

1052
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,740
Rym: George just wants to fuck shit up, that's all he cares about.

1053
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,140
Rym: He's like, come on, come on, let me take over, it'll be fine.

1054
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,000
Scott: And the two princesses, you know, the princess and her assistant, it's like, they're all right.

1055
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,840
Scott: And they have, you know, they're, you know, whatever.

1056
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,440
Scott: But they're not, like, strong.

1057
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:15,140
Scott: Look at the ponies, the ponies are strong characters, right?

1058
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:17,620
Scott: It's like Twilight Sparkle, the nerd, right?

1059
00:54:18,081 --> 00:54:20,000
Rym: Also the Jean Grey, but we'll talk about that later.

1060
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:26,500
Scott: Yeah, well that's why people always compare it to, like, Team Fortress 2, which also has the strong personalities in the characters, you know?

1061
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:30,840
Scott: And that's, you know, I guess that just works for me, when the characters are like that.

1062
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,240
Scott: How'd you mean if it was the same thing, right?

1063
00:54:32,281 --> 00:54:33,479
Rym: Oh my god, I was looking for it.

1064
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:38,998
Rym: The best Gardakhan name in Wakafu is Grogologran.

1065
00:54:40,166 --> 00:54:40,312
Scott: Wow.

1066
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,647
Rym: G-R-O-U-G-A-L-O-R-A-G-R-A-N.

1067
00:54:47,304 --> 00:54:48,119
Rym: That's pretty great.

1068
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:50,879
Scott: It's Grogologran.

1069
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:53,330
Rym: Grogologran.

1070
00:54:54,161 --> 00:54:57,300
Scott: Yeah, that's even better than Gardakhan, or Marduk.

1071
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,239
Rym: Noximilian is pretty good, too.

1072
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,779
Scott: There's also, right underneath that, is Cabrock.

1073
00:55:03,221 --> 00:55:04,200
Scott: Cabrock is very Marduk.

1074
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,160
Rym: You're looking at the Wikipedia.

1075
00:55:05,741 --> 00:55:06,245
Scott: So are you.

1076
00:55:06,266 --> 00:55:08,000
Scott: Master Goldtard, yeah.

1077
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:08,679
Rym: Breadnaught.

1078
00:55:08,961 --> 00:55:09,620
Scott: Yeah, we're done with this.

1079
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:10,300
Rym: Yeah, we're done with that.

1080
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,908
Rym: But, you know, it's a fine show.

1081
00:55:11,928 --> 00:55:19,197
Rym: It's like a solid B. I'd say B- because I consider Scrap Princess to be a solid B. I have a pretty nice scale.

1082
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:19,523
Scott: Really?

1083
00:55:19,544 --> 00:55:20,660
Scott: I think it's equal to Scrap Princess.

1084
00:55:21,081 --> 00:55:22,240
Rym: No, Scrap Princess is better.

1085
00:55:22,612 --> 00:55:22,840
Rym: Anyway.

1086
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:24,460
Rym: Because Scrap Princess is a better animation.

1087
00:55:25,624 --> 00:55:27,100
Rym: And I think better characters.

1088
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,020
Rym: And actually was a pretty great show.

1089
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:35,620
Rym: Except for the fact that Scrap Princess pulled the biggest "Let's figure it all out" at the end I've ever seen.

1090
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,840
Rym: Even worse than Paranoid Agent, which is a great show.

1091
00:55:38,303 --> 00:55:39,560
Scott: I'll agree with your B- rating.

1092
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:47,480
Rym: Because Scrap Princess, the entire plot is revealed after the eye catch in the last episode.

1093
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:50,022
Scott: Not as bad as Alien 9.

1094
00:55:50,022 --> 00:55:50,848
Rym: Where the big-?

1095
00:55:50,909 --> 00:55:53,330
Rym: well, because Alien 9 was kind of like in media res.

1096
00:55:53,431 --> 00:55:54,199
Rym: You gotta give it that.

1097
00:55:56,287 --> 00:55:56,598
Scott: Uhhh... no.

1098
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,029
Rym: Plus, that wasn't even a plot.

1099
00:55:58,089 --> 00:56:01,053
Rym: It was just, "Oh, if you happened to watch the credits, that poor girl

1100
00:56:01,093 --> 00:56:01,455
Rym: died.".

1101
00:56:02,181 --> 00:56:02,224
Scott: Oh.

1102
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:08,360
Scott: By getting squished in a very Wicked City kind of way.

1103
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,840
Rym: Alien 9 is pretty awesome.

1104
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:13,837
Rym: I feel like we should watch it and review it.

1105
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,680
Rym: Because I haven't seen it since we used to hang out with Luke.

1106
00:56:16,821 --> 00:56:19,500
Scott: I only saw it because I was in a room when someone else was watching it.

1107
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,420
Rym: Gaby was watching it and then we went to play board games.

1108
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:22,689
Scott: I didn't actually watch it.

1109
00:56:22,729 --> 00:56:24,120
Scott: I was just in a room when it was being watched.

1110
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,336
Rym: I have a manga from it, too, laying around.

1111
00:56:26,376 --> 00:56:26,880
Rym: I don't know why.

1112
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:27,859
Rym: I don't know where I got it.

1113
00:56:28,661 --> 00:56:30,000
Scott: I can't even remember this shit.

1114
00:56:37,832 --> 00:56:39,950
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1115
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:45,090
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1116
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:50,490
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1117
00:56:50,772 --> 00:56:53,450
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1118
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:58,190
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1119
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:01,706
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1120
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:05,990
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1121
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:09,110
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
