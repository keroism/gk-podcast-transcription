1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,307
Rym: It's Tuesday, September 6th, 2011.

2
00:00:12,307 --> 00:00:12,768
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,069 --> 00:00:13,690
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,293
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:21,111
Rym: Tonight, we're back from PAX Prime 2011.

6
00:00:21,111 --> 00:00:22,128
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,371 --> 00:00:27,890
Rym: And we're back from PAX Prime 2011.

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,576
Scott: Which means going to work.

9
00:00:29,917 --> 00:00:32,183
Rym: Six months until PAX is what that means.

10
00:00:32,223 --> 00:00:32,706
Scott: That's all right.

11
00:00:32,846 --> 00:00:33,970
Rym: And then, six months.

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,878
Scott: So at work, we're not- Maybe less.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,773
Scott: I was tem- they were renovating the office, stupidly, but anyway.

14
00:00:40,154 --> 00:00:40,756
Scott: Enough about that.

15
00:00:40,796 --> 00:00:46,934
Scott: The point is, as it relates to me, that I was temporarily moved upstairs to where they subletted part of someone else's office.

16
00:00:46,954 --> 00:00:47,697
Scott: All right.

17
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:48,319
Scott: That ended.

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,300
Scott: I'm back in our office in what used to be a conference room, which is now full of desks.

19
00:00:53,228 --> 00:00:57,483
Scott: And the main problem I'm having is this room is a woman.

20
00:00:58,466 --> 00:01:02,937
Scott: It doesn't matter if, you know, it's 90 degrees outside.

21
00:01:03,017 --> 00:01:10,489
Scott: This room has four or five people in it and air conditioning and it might as well be fucking out of space in this room.

22
00:01:11,492 --> 00:01:14,703
Rym: I have not had nice things to say about any building I've worked in in the city.

23
00:01:14,723 --> 00:01:18,770
Scott: It seems like the hotter it gets outside- I was fine before all this renovating happened.

24
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,870
Rym: The hotter it gets outside, the colder it gets inside.

25
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:27,010
Scott: Anyway, so I need, you know, I'm like, well, I'll get me a hoodie to wear at work.

26
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:28,756
Rym: What hoodie are you gonna get?

27
00:01:29,057 --> 00:01:31,970
Scott: Well, I mean, I have a Mets hoodie and a Giants hoodie.

28
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,861
Scott: Can't really wear a Mets hoodie.

29
00:01:34,941 --> 00:01:36,510
Scott: That's kind of sad.

30
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,053
Scott: Giants hoodie?

31
00:01:38,113 --> 00:01:42,490
Scott: Well, football is starting, so I wore it today, but A, it's a thin hoodie.

32
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,724
Scott: It's not, you know, one of those thick ones that will really keep me warm.

33
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:51,243
Scott: And two, Giants are gonna look like they're gonna be kind of sad.

34
00:01:51,364 --> 00:01:52,730
Rym: So wait, wait, wait, wait, Scott.

35
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,457
Rym: You're what they call a fair weather fan.

36
00:01:55,697 --> 00:01:55,938
Scott: What?

37
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:56,259
Scott: No.

38
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:59,830
Rym: You're not gonna show Mets pride unless they're winning?

39
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,544
Scott: Well, no, listen, I'm not changing what I'm a fan of.

40
00:02:03,965 --> 00:02:05,090
Rym: But you're keeping it private.

41
00:02:05,652 --> 00:02:08,640
Scott: No, I'm not hiding this information.

42
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:10,567
Rym: So why will you not wear the Mets hoodie?

43
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:11,390
Rym: I mean, it's just a hoodie.

44
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,513
Rym: You don't care what people think of you.

45
00:02:13,135 --> 00:02:14,339
Scott: It's not about what people think.

46
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,165
Rym: All right, then what's it about?

47
00:02:16,646 --> 00:02:17,770
Scott: It is about luck.

48
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:20,313
Scott: Uh-huh.

49
00:02:20,654 --> 00:02:25,970
Scott: It's like if you have a totem for, you know, the losing God, it doesn't help.

50
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,250
Rym: So wait, you wearing it will give the Mets bad luck or the Mets will give you bad luck?

51
00:02:33,431 --> 00:02:34,178
Scott: Both ways.

52
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,208
Scott: Uh-huh.

53
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,770
Scott: Just like you can't buy someone's jersey because it means they're gonna get injured the next week.

54
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,211
Rym: You know what?

55
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:46,590
Rym: I have a Sergei Fedorov jersey that I got way long time ago, and he never really got injured.

56
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:58,090
Scott: Well, the best way to go is to get a jersey of someone who is awesome and is long since retired because if you buy a jersey while someone's still playing or early in the career, something's gonna happen.

57
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,790
Scott: It's gonna make your money a waste of money.

58
00:03:00,632 --> 00:03:01,538
Scott: Right, and it's like.

59
00:03:01,638 --> 00:03:07,828
Scott: even then it's like, you know, you might get something and the guy might retire afterwards and have a long good career.

60
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:13,370
Scott: and you think, "Yeah, I got my money's worth out of this jersey," and then turns out to be a criminal or something later on.

61
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:17,030
Rym: I think the most likely bad outcome is autoerotic asphyxiation.

62
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,514
Rym: That's also a problem.

63
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:19,299
Rym: Seems to be the going thing.

64
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,638
Scott: Yeah, but anyway, so I go online to look for some hoodies.

65
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:26,026
Rym: There aren't really that many good nerdy hoodies.

66
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:37,877
Scott: I went to Threadless, I went to ThinkGeek, I went to Busted Tees, I went to those people who come to PAX all the time with the BitBoy shirt with the flying Game Boy, fun something, fan gamer.

67
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:38,559
Scott: I went to them.

68
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:41,990
Scott: I went to just about every purveyor.

69
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,155
Scott: I went to Topatico.

70
00:03:43,175 --> 00:03:49,659
Scott: I went to every purveyor of nerdy apparel that is related to the nerdies that I have.

71
00:03:49,899 --> 00:03:53,550
Scott: Animes, manga, comics, video games, everything.

72
00:03:54,911 --> 00:04:03,991
Scott: I could not find one hoodie that, you know, there were plenty of hoodies that, for example, I fully endorse, such as Dr.

73
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:06,097
Scott: McNinja shark high-five.

74
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:07,682
Rym: So why not get that hoodie?

75
00:04:08,043 --> 00:04:10,009
Scott: Because it's kind of dorky, right?

76
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,857
Rym: It's not dorky if you own it.

77
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:12,540
Rym: You got to own it.

78
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,666
Rym: You got to double down.

79
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:18,043
Scott: If I was in high school, that'd be awesome, but it is not stylin' for wearin' in the office.

80
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:19,390
Rym: I don't know.

81
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:23,530
Rym: I feel like it is retro stylin', as long as you own it.

82
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:25,420
Scott: I don't think so.

83
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:26,326
Rym: You can't own things?

84
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:26,810
Rym: You own the kilt?

85
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:35,730
Scott: Too many of the hoodies out there, even if they had something on them that I endorsed, did not have a high-class visual style to them.

86
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:43,689
Rym: I should simply like a very, like if I had to buy a hoodie right now, what I want is a very subtle, very classy My Little Pony design.

87
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:49,070
Rym: Like some vector art, maybe a little, like a cutie mark, and that's it.

88
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:57,150
Scott: I may invest in a solid colored hoodie, because everything else seems to be fail, and that'll be that.

89
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,030
Rym: I would not mind a hoodie of my current desktop background in some fashion.

90
00:05:01,232 --> 00:05:02,018
Scott: It's not too bad.

91
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:03,730
Rym: Of all the Rainbow Dashes, this is my favorite right now.

92
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:08,210
Scott: But you know how Penny Arcade has that first party, which is like polo shirts with a tiny little logo on them?

93
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:08,551
Scott: Yeah.

94
00:05:08,752 --> 00:05:09,013
Scott: Right?

95
00:05:09,415 --> 00:05:10,981
Scott: We need like that, but with a hoodie.

96
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,030
Scott: They don't make a first party hoodie.

97
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,089
Rym: Well, you don't really put a polo mark on a hoodie.

98
00:05:16,551 --> 00:05:21,810
Scott: I'm just saying you don't do that exactly, but I'm saying that same kind of, you know, high-class style.

99
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,401
Rym: Maybe, maybe.

100
00:05:23,462 --> 00:05:24,229
Rym: High-class hoodie.

101
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,029
Rym: I don't know, I bet if I looked, I could find a nice high-class hoodie.

102
00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:33,330
Rym: Or, Scott, you know what a high-class garment is that you wear when you're cold and you don't want to look like a doofus?

103
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:34,528
Rym: A suit.

104
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,369
Scott: Yeah, not wearing a suit to work.

105
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,630
Rym: I wear a suit every day.

106
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,829
Scott: Not biking in a suit.

107
00:05:40,671 --> 00:05:41,649
Rym: Leave a suit at the office.

108
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,950
Scott: Not going in a suit in the rain, not wearing shoes.

109
00:05:44,152 --> 00:05:45,950
Rym: Leave like five suits at the office.

110
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,349
Scott: Where am I going to leave them?

111
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,329
Rym: You don't have a giant closet just for suits?

112
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,390
Scott: There is no closet for anything.

113
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,730
Scott: No one has a closet.

114
00:05:53,756 --> 00:05:54,729
Scott: There are no closets.

115
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,790
Rym: I've never worked anywhere in my life where I didn't have a closet.

116
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,130
Rym: If not a personal closet, at least a shared, safe closet in a communal area.

117
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,468
Scott: None closets.

118
00:06:05,371 --> 00:06:11,290
Rym: So, in the video game news, I've done this a couple of times in the distant past.

119
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,150
Rym: I want to talk about something that isn't news, that people are pretending is news because it bothers me.

120
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,110
Scott: That happens all the time.

121
00:06:17,851 --> 00:06:19,341
Scott: Usually I'm complaining about tech news.

122
00:06:19,361 --> 00:06:20,530
Scott: that's actually business news.

123
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,680
Rym: So, here's the thing.

124
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,510
Rym: It's on Slashdot.

125
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:28,064
Rym: They made the rounds about some people who played Breakout on a building.

126
00:06:28,204 --> 00:06:30,570
Rym: like has been done for over a decade.

127
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:31,808
Rym: Nothing special.

128
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:36,290
Rym: But, they did it by using a Kinect.

129
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,629
Scott: So, which part of your body did you move to move the paddle back and forth?

130
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,308
Rym: Whole body.

131
00:06:40,411 --> 00:06:41,810
Scott: So, you had to run back and forth?

132
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,190
Rym: Yeah, you got to like move your body, like lean to the left, lean to the right.

133
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,390
Scott: Oh, just leaning, not running?

134
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,010
Rym: Yeah, because they can't see you if you run.

135
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:48,880
Scott: Oh, lame.

136
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:49,369
Scott: That's true.

137
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,850
Scott: What if you strung up a bunch of Kinects horizontal to each other?

138
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,030
Rym: You'd have to write some software to handle that.

139
00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:00,150
Scott: Right, and basically each Kinect would pick you up and when you got to the left of one Kinect, it would put you in there.

140
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,289
Rym: That might have been news.

141
00:07:02,814 --> 00:07:03,884
Rym: This is making the rounds.

142
00:07:03,904 --> 00:07:04,510
Rym: I don't know why.

143
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:09,630
Rym: I mean, playing Breakout or Pac-Man or something on the side of the building, that happens all the time.

144
00:07:09,731 --> 00:07:11,989
Rym: Like, people just did that at RIT more than once.

145
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,650
Scott: Yeah.

146
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:22,969
Rym: And the Kinect part, it's like alright, you did a kind of cool but derivative thing and you simultaneously used a really crappy controller for it.

147
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,170
Rym: I mean, how is this making the rounds?

148
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:29,190
Rym: Like, who is impressed by this as something new or interesting?

149
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,890
Scott: Non-technological people.

150
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:31,298
Scott: Maybe.

151
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,150
Scott: Unsophisticated people.

152
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:35,210
Rym: That's all I got.

153
00:07:35,676 --> 00:07:36,329
Rym: That's my news.

154
00:07:36,972 --> 00:07:38,369
Scott: So, there's this game coming out.

155
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:40,530
Scott: It's actually out already on Xbox.

156
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,364
Scott: It'll be out on September 7th.

157
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,410
Rym: How did I not know this game was coming?

158
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,950
Scott: I knew it was coming, I just didn't investigate it that much.

159
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,289
Rym: But, like, I didn't see it at PAX.

160
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,570
Rym: I figured it would be there.

161
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,410
Scott: I also didn't see it at PAX.

162
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,010
Scott: I think it was there, maybe, but I didn't, anyway.

163
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:53,949
Rym: I did not see it.

164
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:55,223
Scott: I didn't see it there either.

165
00:07:55,244 --> 00:07:55,830
Scott: I saw it elsewhere.

166
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,170
Scott: But anyway, it's called Rock of Ages.

167
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:05,085
Scott: It's going to be out on Steam on the September 7th, which it's probably already September 7th, because right now I'm talking and it's 7 o'clock on September 6th.

168
00:08:07,093 --> 00:08:08,969
Scott: And the trailer for this game is unbelievable.

169
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,170
Rym: I don't even know if we should really say what happens in this trailer.

170
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,869
Scott: This is like Terry Gilliam makes a video game.

171
00:08:16,213 --> 00:08:16,810
Rym: I'll put it this way.

172
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,370
Scott: That's some combination of Marble Madness and Defense versus Marble Madness.

173
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,661
Scott: You have two options here.

174
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,530
Scott: I don't know how it works, but it's awesome.

175
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,050
Rym: You've got two options.

176
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:30,290
Rym: You can either watch the trailer and then buy the game, or just buy the game.

177
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,110
Scott: Yeah, don't get the trial, just buy the game.

178
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:34,850
Rym: I mean, how expensive can it be?

179
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:36,729
Rym: Even if it sucks, I feel like...

180
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,870
Scott: It's like 9 bucks on Steam, something like that.

181
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,409
Rym: I feel like playing this against other people, even if it only lasts a couple days.

182
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:44,310
Scott: I wonder if they let you play it against other people.

183
00:08:44,471 --> 00:08:45,990
Rym: I saw a split screen they were showing.

184
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:46,457
Rym: Really?

185
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:47,090
Rym: Yeah.

186
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:48,969
Rym: I was in the trailer, you showed me.

187
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,670
Scott: It's 9 bucks on Steam, let me get the info's here.

188
00:08:51,670 --> 00:09:02,310
Rym: Yeah, because seriously, this... It's one of those games where if there is a multiplayer component, I'm pretty sure there is, it will not be played too far out into the future, most likely.

189
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,329
Rym: Well, I doubt it will be the best game ever.

190
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:11,330
Scott: But... A rock solid combination of rock rolling action, deep strategy, and captivating art and music from different ages of history.

191
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,989
Scott: This is a game of crush or be crushed.

192
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,350
Scott: Two castles stand opposed, one is yours, the other is your enemies.

193
00:09:16,811 --> 00:09:21,070
Scott: They're a jerk, and their castle sucks, so you're gonna try to smash it using an enormous boulder.

194
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,217
Scott: Huh.

195
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,469
Scott: Single player, multiplayer, Steam, Steam, Steam, Steam, Steam.

196
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:26,889
Rym: So, let me put it this way.

197
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:33,887
Rym: It's one of those games where it may or may not be good, but even if it's bad, the week or so we're gonna get of multiplayer on.

198
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,250
Rym: this bullshit is gonna be awesome.

199
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,888
Scott: I'm definitely getting it.

200
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,710
Scott: Actually, I already pre-ordered it, and I'm just waiting to download it tomorrow.

201
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,650
Rym: Yeah, so kids in the forum, we're gonna be playing this this weekend.

202
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,910
Scott: Probably.

203
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,980
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

204
00:09:53,562 --> 00:09:54,520
Rym: I got a quickie, actually.

205
00:09:54,882 --> 00:09:58,139
Rym: I have something horrible about deep-fried bubblegum, but I figured I should save that.

206
00:09:58,802 --> 00:10:02,540
Rym: Also, it kinda makes me nauseous just to think about deep-fried bubblegum as a foodie.

207
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,619
Scott: Wait a minute, so dig the gum before it's been chewed.

208
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,720
Scott: You put the funnel cake on it, so you chew it and you get the immediate funnel cake flavor, and then after that, it's like a blow pop where you chew.

209
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:22,799
Rym: So apparently it's actually marshmallow with bubblegum flavoring in it, dipped in batter, fried, covered in icing, sprinkled with powdered sugar, and I believe fried again.

210
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,320
Scott: So no part of it is actually bubblegum, except for bubblegum flavoring on the marshmallow.

211
00:10:27,482 --> 00:10:29,000
Scott: You just eat it, you don't chew it.

212
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,420
Rym: It won some Texas contest for most fucked up food at a fair.

213
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:34,320
Scott: Most fucked up, but not best tasting.

214
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:35,358
Rym: Also best.

215
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:36,280
Rym: Oh, okay.

216
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,098
Rym: It won the contest, which nominally was the best, but I argue is the most fucked up.

217
00:10:40,623 --> 00:10:41,717
Rym: Because somehow...

218
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,799
Scott: It probably tastes great.

219
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,100
Rym: But somehow the flapjack did not win.

220
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,620
Scott: Just the plain old flapjack?

221
00:10:47,143 --> 00:10:58,771
Rym: The buffalo chicken in a flapjack is described as, quote, "A buffalo chicken strip, coated in flapjack batter, rolled in jalapeno breadcrumbs, deep-fried, skewered, served with a side of

222
00:10:58,872 --> 00:10:59,195
Rym: syrup.".

223
00:11:00,724 --> 00:11:02,137
Scott: I think that if it was...

224
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:11,673
Rym: Or, fried salsa, "spicy medley of jalapenos, roasted garlic, onion, tomato, and pepper, dipped in masa, covered in tortilla chips, served on a creamy

225
00:11:11,734 --> 00:11:12,238
Rym: queso.".

226
00:11:12,461 --> 00:11:18,720
Scott: Here's the problem with that flapjack, is that they used a buffalo chicken in there.

227
00:11:19,061 --> 00:11:24,580
Scott: If they had used, say, the Korean fried spicy chicken, I might die.

228
00:11:25,122 --> 00:11:28,540
Scott: Then they would have beaten the bubblegum, marshmallow, not bubblegum.

229
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,780
Rym: This raises an important point.

230
00:11:29,841 --> 00:11:32,877
Rym: We have not been back to that Korean fried chicken place in quite some time.

231
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:34,220
Scott: That is true.

232
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,239
Rym: I think we should rectify this.

233
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,279
Rym: Conrad's back in town.

234
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:36,856
Scott: Let's go.

235
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,291
Scott: Yeah.

236
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,820
Rym: So anyway, fuck that.

237
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:44,379
Rym: My real thing of the day is a very important chart of evolution of something near and dear to all of you.

238
00:11:44,901 --> 00:11:46,260
Rym: The humble video game controller.

239
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:51,540
Rym: Because, as I learned when I was playing some... I did the same thing you did.

240
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,838
Rym: I went through the Omegathon finale to see how I could do it, and I videoed it and recorded it.

241
00:11:57,924 --> 00:12:05,020
Rym: And Xbox 360 controller, even the new one, its D-pad, does not quite make it compared to the original NES Plus.

242
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,980
Scott: Are you blaming me being doing better than you?

243
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:07,960
Rym: I don't know if you did better.

244
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:08,498
Rym: I don't know how...

245
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,319
Scott: I didn't watch your video.

246
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,340
Scott: I did basically perfect.

247
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:19,198
Rym: In fact, the only thing that I think is unfair is that we both saw the Omegathon, so if one of us did not actually remember the way to Aquamentis, we knew it then.

248
00:12:20,023 --> 00:12:20,400
Scott: That's true.

249
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,520
Scott: I did have a slight memory refresh from watching the Omegathon.

250
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:33,198
Rym: Because had I gone into it, not having seen the Omegathon finale, I have a feeling I would have opened one of the wrong doors with the key first, but as soon as I got in there, "Oh, fuck," and gone back.

251
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,600
Scott: I also knew exactly how many keys I needed and where they all were.

252
00:12:36,782 --> 00:12:40,200
Rym: I feel like I would not have remembered that had I not just watched the Omegathon.

253
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:41,729
Scott: Actually...

254
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:42,579
Rym: See, I don't know.

255
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:43,180
Rym: There's the thing.

256
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,699
Rym: I want to say I would, but I can't say for sure.

257
00:12:46,402 --> 00:12:47,860
Scott: I'm going to err on the side of caution.

258
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:51,339
Scott: when I was watching the Omegathon, I knew where to go and what to do.

259
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:53,640
Rym: Yeah, as evidenced by the yelling.

260
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,480
Scott: Yes, anyway.

261
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:00,517
Scott: So I was going to use ponies as my thing of the day because I've been holding out and basically ponies keep building up, but you know what?

262
00:13:00,882 --> 00:13:05,820
Scott: I, at the last second, found a thing of the day classic that was never used as a thing of the day.

263
00:13:06,021 --> 00:13:06,165
Rym: What?

264
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:06,700
Rym: Are you sure?

265
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,219
Scott: A hundred percent sure.

266
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:14,260
Scott: So, way back in the day, RIT days, we liked to play Zelda 1.

267
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,409
Rym: We did.

268
00:13:15,266 --> 00:13:16,018
Rym: Oh, you're using this?

269
00:13:16,527 --> 00:13:16,800
Rym: Yeah.

270
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:17,540
Rym: Really?

271
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,159
Rym: I'm pretty sure we talked about this.

272
00:13:19,681 --> 00:13:20,960
Scott: It was not a thing of the day.

273
00:13:21,141 --> 00:13:21,538
Scott: I searched.

274
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:21,961
Rym: Huh.

275
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:22,555
Rym: Huh.

276
00:13:22,822 --> 00:13:30,177
Scott: So anyway, so yeah, we liked to play Zelda 1 and we beat it and we liked to play Zelda 2nd Quest and we beat that.

277
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:31,294
Rym: When did you beat it?

278
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,000
Scott: 2nd Quest?

279
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,839
Rym: Yeah, as a kid?

280
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,400
Rym: Uh... Or did you go back and beat it later?

281
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:40,042
Scott: No, when I was a kid, I could never find level fucking 8.

282
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:41,000
Rym: Ah, I found level 8.

283
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,860
Rym: What I could not find at the end of the game was the fucking silver arrows.

284
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:50,639
Rym: I wrote a letter to Nintendo Power and they sent me back a full color map showing where the silver arrows were.

285
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,219
Scott: Nice, where's that map at?

286
00:13:52,863 --> 00:13:56,940
Rym: Uh, probably in the same place that my Zelda 1 cart and everything is in Arizona.

287
00:13:57,501 --> 00:14:02,979
Scott: So I polished off level 8 and whatever after internets was better one summer.

288
00:14:03,201 --> 00:14:04,315
Scott: I think this summer...

289
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,900
Rym: Better after internets existed as far as we were concerned.

290
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:13,039
Scott: Yeah, so I was able to search and figure out where level 8 was on the internets in like summer of '01, '02, something like that when I was home.

291
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,299
Scott: Anyway, uh... When was... I don't know.

292
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,039
Scott: I definitely was at home summer after college.

293
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,400
Scott: Anyway, there was a mod for Zelda 1.

294
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:38,580
Scott: Basically, the way this works is you download a legit rom of regular old Zelda 1. then you download this other thing and it patches the rom and it makes a new Zelda game called The Legend of Zelda Outlands AKA Zelda Sea AKA Zelda Challenge Outland.

295
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,440
Scott: AKA Fuck This Game Fuck This Game Fuck This Game, Fuck This Game.

296
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:55,314
Scott: So, we downloaded this game way back in the day when it first came out and we tried to play it at RIT on our emulators in like '02, '03 and you couldn't even get past like three screens of overworld.

297
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,200
Rym: I remember going into this at RIT, we were like "Yeah, we're good at video games.

298
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,445
Rym: Let's

299
00:14:59,487 --> 00:14:59,673
Rym: go.".

300
00:15:00,044 --> 00:15:05,058
Rym: And I go up and there's no old man to give me a sword and I didn't know what to do.

301
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:10,519
Rym: and then I wandered around dying until eventually I run into Zelda who says, and I quote "It's me, Zelda.

302
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,135
Rym: I found your

303
00:15:12,216 --> 00:15:12,459
Rym: sword.".

304
00:15:13,644 --> 00:15:17,036
Scott: I like it when you go to a Goron and he's like "We Gorons have rock bottom

305
00:15:17,076 --> 00:15:17,520
Scott: prices.".

306
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,792
Scott: Ah, ah, ah, ah.

307
00:15:19,884 --> 00:15:22,358
Scott: But yeah, no, it's a real... This game is basically...

308
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,120
Rym: This is a triumph of ROM hacking.

309
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,660
Scott: It's impossible Zelda.

310
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:32,800
Scott: They may... If you're out there thinking "Man, I wish there was... Nintendo would make a game just like Zelda 1 but, you know, was just a new Zelda 1.

311
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,520
Scott: Well, that game exists.

312
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,157
Scott: Zelda Sea.

313
00:15:35,161 --> 00:15:36,760
Scott: It's hard as balls.

314
00:15:37,482 --> 00:15:50,620
Rym: I would simply argue that while it's hard as balls and it is kind of fun Zelda 1 second quest was not as good a game as Zelda 1 first quest because there were more arbitrary bullshit secrets.

315
00:15:50,681 --> 00:15:51,879
Scott: Walk into this wall.

316
00:15:51,961 --> 00:15:52,313
Rym: Yeah.

317
00:15:52,904 --> 00:15:54,780
Rym: Now you didn't just have to bomb every wall.

318
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,840
Rym: You had to bomb every wall and walk into every wall.

319
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,739
Scott: It has the Wolfenstein 3D aspect of touch every wall.

320
00:16:00,262 --> 00:16:00,534
Rym: Which...

321
00:16:00,763 --> 00:16:02,580
Scott: At least in Zelda there's only four per room.

322
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,680
Rym: What amazes me is that now I think about that I'm like "Oh, really?

323
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,024
Rym: Uhhh.".

324
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,620
Rym: And I'm going around like pushing against every wall because I don't fucking remember the second quest worth anything.

325
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,532
Scott: Just bring a...

326
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,700
Rym: But... I'm not going to read a fact.

327
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,010
Rym: No.

328
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:15,979
Rym: Because I am playing the second quest right now.

329
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:16,620
Scott: Good luck.

330
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,419
Rym: I got almost one piece of the Triforce.

331
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,011
Scott: Great.

332
00:16:20,801 --> 00:16:22,120
Scott: It's easy to get one piece.

333
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:23,880
Rym: And not as easy as you'd think though.

334
00:16:24,061 --> 00:16:25,558
Scott: It's not the one piece it's a one piece.

335
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,760
Rym: You walk into that one room and there's a bunch of staff flows.

336
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:28,527
Rym: staff

337
00:16:28,548 --> 00:16:28,695
Rym: flows.".

338
00:16:28,841 --> 00:16:30,380
Scott: And then the Gibdo in the first dungeon.

339
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,460
Rym: Does like four hearts of damage against my three hearts of life.

340
00:16:33,764 --> 00:16:34,018
Rym: Yeah.

341
00:16:34,481 --> 00:16:35,900
Rym: Nevermind the blue... Well, anyway.

342
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,120
Rym: But, uh, I don't know.

343
00:16:38,141 --> 00:16:53,497
Rym: when I was a kid when I learned from a friend that you could just push through some walls and walk through them instead of getting angry I got excited and I went back home and gleefully for the next like seven hours pushed against every wall in every dungeon just to see.

344
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,802
Scott: But now it's like Ugh.

345
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:02,046
Rym: I don't know what trigger in my brain flipped from "This is awesome" to "Fuck

346
00:17:02,086 --> 00:17:02,289
Rym: this."

347
00:17:03,203 --> 00:17:03,431
Rym: To like...

348
00:17:03,884 --> 00:17:10,480
Scott: I think what it is is that when you're a kid right the reward of discovery of secrets is like so great.

349
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:16,558
Scott: Like just discovering a hidden thing is just like so magical that you don't even notice the work you put in to finding it.

350
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:28,798
Scott: Whereas now it's not like it's totally demystified and there's no magic of discovery because we know it's there and it's just the manual labor that we had to put into.

351
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:30,807
Scott: it is so monotonous and mind-numbing right?

352
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,219
Scott: Because we were smarter that what, you know, that work as a kid.

353
00:17:36,545 --> 00:17:41,619
Scott: I guess to a kid it doesn't feel as monotonous and mind-numbing because your mind isn't numbed yet.

354
00:17:41,902 --> 00:17:44,619
Scott: To us it's like repetitive monotonous manual labor.

355
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,100
Rym: There's more to it than that.

356
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,800
Rym: It also just comes down to the fact that it was exploration and there was no other option.

357
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,759
Rym: I mean back then I'm searching around Zelda and there's no one to tell me where anything is.

358
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,860
Rym: There's no game facts.

359
00:17:58,241 --> 00:18:00,800
Rym: So everything I discovered was like social currency.

360
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:09,892
Rym: You could go to friends when you were a kid when we were growing up and say things like "I found a fucking secret that you don't know about and they wouldn't believe

361
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:10,034
Rym: you."

362
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:13,019
Rym: And you'd take them home and you'd show it to them and they'd flip their shit.

363
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:13,675
Scott: Yup.

364
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,980
Rym: Like I remember showing a kid that mine is world.

365
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:17,419
Scott: Kids now can't even do that.

366
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,780
Rym: There was this like legends would rise.

367
00:18:20,361 --> 00:18:21,780
Rym: I mean remember like a classic example.

368
00:18:22,122 --> 00:18:24,459
Rym: You can totally bring General Leo back from the dead.

369
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:24,980
Scott: Yup.

370
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,578
Rym: You can totally bring Parham and Parham back from the dead.

371
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,029
Scott: Yup.

372
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:29,819
Rym: Totally bring Telos back from the dead.

373
00:18:31,062 --> 00:18:31,252
Rym: Spoilers.

374
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:33,760
Scott: Yeah.

375
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,140
Scott: I mean the mine is world was crazy enough, right?

376
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:42,255
Scott: People would talk about it and you'd have a friend who had read it in a Nintendo Power or something but then couldn't do it so you wouldn't believe him.

377
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:43,720
Rym: And kids would make shit up.

378
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,039
Rym: I had one friend who kept saying he jumped over the flagpole.

379
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,481
Scott: I had plenty of friends who would be like, "Yeah, Mortal Kombat 2.

380
00:18:50,481 --> 00:18:53,659
Scott: I was in the arcade watching some dude play and you saw Sonya's tits.

381
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:54,183
Rym: Oh

382
00:18:54,205 --> 00:18:54,270
Rym: man.".

383
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:54,575
Rym: Yup.

384
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:56,420
Scott: Anyway.

385
00:18:57,645 --> 00:18:59,976
Scott: So Zelda C, I dare you to fucking play this shit.

386
00:19:00,302 --> 00:19:00,839
Rym: I dare you to.

387
00:19:01,002 --> 00:19:02,779
Rym: I don't even dare you to beat it because that's not fair.

388
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,819
Rym: That's like daring someone.

389
00:19:04,402 --> 00:19:06,360
Rym: I dare you to even find the first dungeon.

390
00:19:06,621 --> 00:19:11,039
Rym: It's telling that in the screenshots they got here it shows three games.

391
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,712
Rym: You know how?

392
00:19:12,894 --> 00:19:15,639
Rym: in Zelda the number under your name is the number of times you've died?

393
00:19:16,641 --> 00:19:19,539
Rym: It shows someone with some items who may have beaten the game.

394
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,507
Rym: He's died 93 times.

395
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:28,318
Rym: I in Zelda Second Quest am almost at the Triforce and I've died three times.

396
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,540
Rym: So very briefly the meta moment.

397
00:19:31,682 --> 00:19:32,697
Rym: All you new listeners from PAX.

398
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,938
Rym: This is where we do all the announcements about the show and community shit that you might not care about.

399
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:38,739
Scott: You got any?

400
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:39,499
Rym: We do.

401
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:41,479
Rym: The book club book is The Ear, The Eye, The Arm.

402
00:19:42,101 --> 00:19:42,719
Scott: Have you read it yet?

403
00:19:43,123 --> 00:19:44,077
Rym: It hasn't arrived yet.

404
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,155
Rym: It shipped so I'll have it soon.

405
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:47,000
Rym: It's a short read.

406
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,180
Rym: I'll read it as soon as I get it.

407
00:19:48,445 --> 00:19:52,140
Scott: We'll do the episode real soon because we plan to do one a month and it's already the second month.

408
00:19:52,443 --> 00:19:53,699
Rym: We'll let it go a month and then we'll be good.

409
00:19:55,045 --> 00:19:55,358
Rym: That's it.

410
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,600
Scott: We're doing a worst webcomic contest.

411
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,796
Scott: We're going to do that real soon.

412
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,818
Rym: It's pretty much over.

413
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,599
Scott: Like next week.

414
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,731
Rym: Unless there's a webcomic that you really really hate.

415
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:06,634
Rym: that isn't control alt delete because that's already been submitted a bunch of times.

416
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,415
Rym: Then there'll be a link to it.

417
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:18,736
Rym: Otherwise if you saw us at PAX and you wanted more of what you saw two of our lectures soon to be three from PAX East 2011 are up on YouTube and I will link to them.

418
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,358
Scott: All right.

419
00:20:20,246 --> 00:20:25,218
Scott: You should go to our internets in general frontroadcrew.com, Facebook, Twitter, etc.

420
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,139
Rym: All that stuff.

421
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:36,439
Rym: Also if you were talking to us about ponies you might want to know that we did a pilot of a show called Radio Free Equestria and many of you have been bothering me.

422
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:39,414
Scott: understand that was a pilot and they're like where is there more episodes?

423
00:20:39,981 --> 00:20:42,333
Rym: I get so much shit about that show every day.

424
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,000
Rym: When's it coming?

425
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:43,619
Rym: When's it coming?

426
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,220
Rym: these people found my email address.

427
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,659
Scott: How do you know it's even coming?

428
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:48,840
Rym: So it's coming.

429
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,758
Rym: Just hold tight you bronies.

430
00:20:51,983 --> 00:21:01,013
Rym: And last but not least many people relative to how many I expected which was zero came up to us at PAX and said oh my god you guys should have been at PAX dev.

431
00:21:01,381 --> 00:21:07,759
Rym: So if you were one of those people you should tell the Penny Arcade people and then we will present at PAX dev.

432
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,078
Scott: And Rym do something about merch.

433
00:21:11,822 --> 00:21:12,795
Rym: I got to make some more merch.

434
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:25,198
Rym: One of the constants in my life one of the most not the most important things but something that keeps me going every day that I always think about is that every six months at most I get to go to PAX.

435
00:21:26,062 --> 00:21:26,520
Rym: Aww shit.

436
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:30,139
Rym: I really like you know we've been going to conventions for a long time.

437
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,179
Scott: It's like going to mecha only and twice as often.

438
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,218
Rym: I mean it's interesting that the newness twice is close.

439
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:44,496
Rym: The newness has faded like the first PAX we went to was kind of hard to replicate because it's like when you're a kid go to that first old account you walk into that dealer's room and you just have like.

440
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:45,356
Rym: you can't believe it.

441
00:21:46,385 --> 00:21:48,018
Rym: And the first PAX was kind of like that.

442
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:54,217
Rym: and now we're older we've gone to many PAXes many PAXes and yet the wonder is still there.

443
00:21:54,238 --> 00:21:55,960
Rym: it's just kind of shifted into different directions.

444
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,846
Scott: is it's like you know there?

445
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:02,495
Scott: it's like imagine that there was an amusement park with a bunch of roller coasters right and it opened.

446
00:22:02,979 --> 00:22:04,939
Scott: and but it's only open for two three days.

447
00:22:05,204 --> 00:22:07,178
Scott: So you go and you ride as many rides as you can.

448
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:08,836
Scott: then it closes.

449
00:22:08,937 --> 00:22:11,576
Scott: next year it opens for exactly three days.

450
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:17,915
Scott: So you go back and you ride as many rides as you can but the rides you got enough of the first time you maybe don't pay much attention to.

451
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:22,000
Rym: But now you're riding the rides that were there last year that you didn't ride quite so much.

452
00:22:22,062 --> 00:22:29,496
Scott: Right I mean even if there's an amusement park that's open every single day of the year most people only go to it once a year at most right usually less often than that.

453
00:22:29,923 --> 00:22:33,165
Scott: So it's like you keep going back to the same amusement park every single year.

454
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:37,075
Scott: eventually it's like I've ridden all these before even though they're still pretty great.

455
00:22:37,095 --> 00:22:39,577
Scott: maybe I'll ride it again if I haven't done it in a few years.

456
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,579
Rym: But you might go chill.

457
00:22:40,661 --> 00:22:52,486
Rym: when I was a little kid and I go to Cedar Point I would see like the shows like I'd be walking I'd be running not walking on my way to get in line for a roller coaster and I'd see like oh there's some like live music in that restaurant.

458
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:58,500
Rym: who the fuck would go into that restaurant and waste five minutes when they could be in line for a roller coaster.

459
00:22:58,907 --> 00:23:00,331
Scott: Someone who's ridden that roller coaster 20 times.

460
00:23:01,261 --> 00:23:04,639
Rym: Yeah 10 years later I was in that restaurant watching the live show.

461
00:23:06,703 --> 00:23:15,640
Rym: So if you want to hear you know the full review of PAX as a convention listen to all our other PAX episodes because all that stuff really doesn't change.

462
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,038
Rym: we're only going to talk about the things that were unique that we experienced at this PAX.

463
00:23:21,105 --> 00:23:25,550
Scott: So the one thing I noticed overall at this PAX Prime 2011 right?

464
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,029
Rym: Yup.

465
00:23:27,283 --> 00:23:28,362
Scott: Was it seemed like I don't want.

466
00:23:28,382 --> 00:23:30,300
Scott: I'm not saying Penny Arcade sold out right?

467
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:36,500
Scott: I mean if you're going to say Penny Arcade sold out you'd have to say that when Robert Coop first came on and they started selling ads.

468
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,399
Rym: Well here, let's qualify this even broader and I said this to Aaron C. and a couple other people too because I think it's very apt.

469
00:23:42,281 --> 00:23:50,490
Rym: Whenever we criticize PAX the criticisms added up kind of round down to zero compared to you know all the positives.

470
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:58,974
Rym: we don't always talk about because they're given like I very rarely think to say I played a thousand games because that's just a given like.

471
00:23:58,994 --> 00:23:59,813
Rym: yeah of course it's PAX.

472
00:23:59,874 --> 00:24:00,579
Rym: I played a bunch of games.

473
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,120
Rym: Instead I say I saw a star.

474
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,008
Rym: We'll talk about the stars in a bit.

475
00:24:05,802 --> 00:24:14,340
Scott: So you know obviously you can't say Penny Arcade is sold out but PAX was sold a little bit more than it has been in the past right?

476
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,659
Rym: But the majority of it did not affect the convention.

477
00:24:16,699 --> 00:24:18,480
Rym: it was all surface stuff like Firefall.

478
00:24:19,442 --> 00:24:29,379
Rym: That game can't be good and my rationale for saying it's not good is that they I think spent more money on advertising at PAX than everybody else combined spent on advertising.

479
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,520
Scott: Pretty much it's like you know.

480
00:24:30,682 --> 00:24:35,380
Scott: usually each per each company that wants to sell something sponsors one thing right?

481
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:49,995
Scott: So you know Dragon Age will get the hotel key cards and someone else will get the big banners hanging on the ceiling and someone else will get the bags and somebody else will get the stickers on the escalator and someone else will have the biggest booth

482
00:24:50,076 --> 00:24:50,608
Rym: in the expo home.

483
00:24:51,521 --> 00:24:53,040
Rym: stickers on escalators before.

484
00:24:53,383 --> 00:24:56,114
Scott: Yeah someone you know each different company.

485
00:24:56,155 --> 00:24:59,240
Scott: someone will have a car that drives around town advertising their game.

486
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,972
Rym: Firefall had the equivalent of one guy following every individual attendee around yelling Firefall!

487
00:25:05,294 --> 00:25:05,960
Scott: Firefall!

488
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,380
Scott: Every single right?

489
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:16,680
Scott: Now on top of that you had Halo Fest which is an entire gigantic space of the convention devoted to one game series.

490
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,314
Rym: Here's the thing I can't.

491
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,460
Rym: I don't want to be down on it for the wrong reasons.

492
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,199
Scott: It was their anniversary and I doubt they'll do it again.

493
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,117
Rym: No but I'm saying I don't want to be down on it for the wrong reasons.

494
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:29,479
Rym: For example had that been Counter Strike Fest I would have thought it was awesome.

495
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,080
Rym: From the perspective of people who like Halo that was awesome.

496
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:38,539
Rym: My complaint about Halo Fest is only that Halo Fest itself did not do much.

497
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:44,253
Rym: If it was Counter Strike Fest and I went up to it and it had the equivalent content of Halo Fest it would have been.

498
00:25:44,273 --> 00:25:46,554
Rym: it would have gotten like a six out of ten like all right.

499
00:25:46,615 --> 00:25:46,948
Rym: that was cool.

500
00:25:47,902 --> 00:25:49,538
Rym: It wasn't worth the amount of space it took up though.

501
00:25:49,941 --> 00:25:54,076
Scott: Yeah that space could have been used for the convention but I'm sure Microsoft paid a lot of money for it.

502
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:58,259
Rym: Mainly because they had a private VIP party for much of Saturday night.

503
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,940
Rym: Or Friday night Friday night.

504
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:05,220
Scott: There were other you know just little things about for example the Penny Arcade merch booth.

505
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:05,680
Scott: right.

506
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,249
Scott: As every PAX have ever been to including East.

507
00:26:08,653 --> 00:26:11,920
Scott: the way it's worked is they were always bundle deals right.

508
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,214
Scott: The way the bundle works is like t-shirt this much money.

509
00:26:15,517 --> 00:26:17,040
Scott: poster this much money.

510
00:26:17,601 --> 00:26:22,340
Scott: Hey if you get a t-shirt and a poster it's less than the price of both of those separately.

511
00:26:23,362 --> 00:26:24,519
Scott: This year they changed that.

512
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:30,049
Scott: Now the way it worked was hey spend if you spent everything is the price it is.

513
00:26:30,352 --> 00:26:33,097
Scott: if you spend at least 50 bucks we'll give you this patch.

514
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,920
Scott: If you spend 70 bucks we'll give you this other thing.

515
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,160
Scott: I sell you this hat five dollar.

516
00:26:38,501 --> 00:26:40,777
Scott: The only thing I wanted was a twenty dollar shirt.

517
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,799
Rym: But you thought about buying something more.

518
00:26:43,262 --> 00:26:44,439
Scott: Well I wanted the patch.

519
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:44,912
Scott: Yup.

520
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,679
Scott: But I didn't want to spend any more money.

521
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,103
Scott: Yup.

522
00:26:48,661 --> 00:26:49,779
Scott: So I didn't get the patch.

523
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,600
Rym: You know what that's called?

524
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,420
Rym: It's called mechanism fucking design.

525
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,639
Rym: We've done panels on that.

526
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,692
Scott: But you know it's just.

527
00:26:54,753 --> 00:26:58,720
Scott: it was a change that was you know in the money making department.

528
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,332
Rym: However that didn't bother me that much because I.

529
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,120
Scott: No I'm not saying it bothered me.

530
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,837
Scott: I'm just saying that that was.

531
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:09,840
Scott: one of the trends of this year's packs was a slight amount of outselling.

532
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,760
Rym: But we have to say again rounds down to zero for example New York Comic-Con.

533
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:15,660
Scott: They expanded the size of the expo hall in general.

534
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,100
Rym: Yeah the fact that there were two expo halls was a little much but there was actually a lot going on in the expo hall.

535
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,743
Rym: If you had removed all the Firefall content from the expo hall they would have only needed one.

536
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:25,795
Scott: That's true.

537
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,760
Rym: Meanwhile if you had removed the halo first.

538
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,680
Rym: Alright so Firefall has like this gigantic booth.

539
00:27:34,002 --> 00:27:34,332
Rym: up for?

540
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:36,120
Rym: Borderlands 2.

541
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,960
Rym: And Counter Strike Go.

542
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,277
Rym: That's where the line was.

543
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,678
Scott: Counter Strike Go, Borderlands 2 these were the kinds of things that had gigantic lines.

544
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:48,840
Scott: In the Zelda game on the Wii the Skyward Sword it had lines but not like the lines for the other things.

545
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:58,860
Scott: I think it's just because they had so many stations and I think part of it right is that some of these games what they do for example Counter Strike Go it's they bring in X number of people on two teams.

546
00:27:59,203 --> 00:28:04,479
Scott: they play X rounds you know one or two how many rounds and then you leave and then new people come in.

547
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,560
Rym: Though we had an awesome moment.

548
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,705
Scott: Right where Zelda Skyward Sword they're these self running demo stations.

549
00:28:08,726 --> 00:28:11,958
Scott: you walk up you play as long as you're gonna play and then you walk away.

550
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,434
Scott: So it's like some people walk up for two seconds and leave.

551
00:28:15,474 --> 00:28:16,810
Scott: so you know.

552
00:28:16,911 --> 00:28:18,551
Scott: that's why they don't need this big line up.

553
00:28:18,632 --> 00:28:21,249
Scott: I think they'd be a lot better off the Counter Strike guys.

554
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:25,639
Scott: they wouldn't have this big line building up if you could just walk up play Counter Strike walk away.

555
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,591
Rym: Well what they need to do?

556
00:28:26,612 --> 00:28:27,605
Rym: Spy Party.

557
00:28:28,171 --> 00:28:28,940
Rym: they really know what's up.

558
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,051
Rym: they had three stations.

559
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:34,878
Rym: one was I've never played Spy Party before and I don't know what the deal is one was.

560
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,200
Scott: Well and I've read the manual the dead little blue manuals you had to read before you could play.

561
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,762
Rym: The second one was I know what's up.

562
00:28:41,084 --> 00:28:47,236
Rym: and the third one was I somehow have played this game as much as someone who will buy this game has played it.

563
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:50,958
Scott: Yeah the thing has already signed up for the beta so I don't need to play it.

564
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,858
Rym: Yeah but once again just to point out the main person behind Spy Party knows what's up.

565
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,025
Scott: Yeah Chris Hecker is the smartest dude.

566
00:28:58,046 --> 00:29:09,279
Rym: I actually talked to him this We talked to him just to be like look you're one of the few people we've ever seen on a panel at a convention like PAX who had any relation to game design and or journalism who knew what was up.

567
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,865
Scott: Yeah anything he does keep an eye on.

568
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,039
Rym: Like he's on the short list.

569
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:16,940
Scott: Just like you should keep an eye on the guy who does Space Chem.

570
00:29:17,306 --> 00:29:17,774
Rym: Yup yup.

571
00:29:18,741 --> 00:29:19,198
Rym: Or Monaco.

572
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,279
Rym: Monaco is up there.

573
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,714
Scott: The Monaco guy the Jason Rohrer guy.

574
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,228
Rym: Though we had a cool moment we were walking you know around in the expo hall.

575
00:29:25,329 --> 00:29:28,859
Rym: we saw this guy with a really awesome like Counter Strike jersey kind of shirt.

576
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,100
Scott: Yeah it was like a bowling shirt but it said Counter Strike.

577
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,440
Rym: We're like what up awesome shirt.

578
00:29:32,501 --> 00:29:32,952
Rym: where'd you get it?

579
00:29:32,972 --> 00:29:34,600
Rym: and the guy's like I made Counter Strike.

580
00:29:34,881 --> 00:29:36,660
Scott: He didn't make Counter Strike but he was a guy who.

581
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:37,333
Rym: That's what he said.

582
00:29:37,354 --> 00:29:39,146
Rym: he's like I made Counter Strike but like what he's like.

583
00:29:39,187 --> 00:29:39,980
Rym: well I you know.

584
00:29:40,344 --> 00:29:42,997
Scott: He's been working on Counter Strike for a few years right?

585
00:29:43,058 --> 00:29:43,859
Scott: so like he was cool.

586
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,136
Scott: He was a cool dude.

587
00:29:45,157 --> 00:29:47,920
Scott: he was actually older like he must have been 40 or 50 something right.

588
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,920
Scott: But he worked on Counter Strike.

589
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,739
Scott: I was like damn thanks.

590
00:29:52,261 --> 00:29:52,940
Scott: Counter Strike's awesome.

591
00:29:54,422 --> 00:29:56,040
Rym: I didn't play Counter Strike at the Con we could have.

592
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,379
Scott: I looked over someone else's shoulder while they played it.

593
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,779
Rym: We were offered by multiple people.

594
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,560
Scott: An Xbox controller.

595
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,638
Rym: To skip to the front of the line.

596
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:03,340
Rym: but they only had Xbox controllers.

597
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:04,120
Rym: I don't really care.

598
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,885
Rym: The game looked like Counter Strike.

599
00:30:05,925 --> 00:30:12,157
Rym: the only thing that didn't look right was that everybody playing was kind of the slow turret turn.

600
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:12,847
Scott: Yeah.

601
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,578
Rym: The I have an Xbox controller turn.

602
00:30:15,742 --> 00:30:19,579
Scott: Yeah where it sort of has like this motion blur and there's like a little time.

603
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:21,758
Rym: People weren't really looking up and down so much.

604
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,100
Rym: They were kind of sweeping left and right at head level.

605
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,600
Scott: Yeah something like that.

606
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,798
Rym: Yeah there's one guy though.

607
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:31,379
Rym: I kept seeing him jump down from above and no one ever saw him because they never looked up and just stabbing people.

608
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:32,938
Rym: That guy knew what was up.

609
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,199
Scott: Yeah well he knew what was down the other guy.

610
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,518
Rym: The other guy didn't know what was up.

611
00:30:37,141 --> 00:30:39,730
Scott: Yeah I saw some people who knew I talked to this guy.

612
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:44,039
Scott: I just you know I was standing there watching other people play Counter Strike you know just looking over their shoulder.

613
00:30:44,182 --> 00:30:46,139
Scott: Yeah some guy next to me was doing the same thing.

614
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,100
Scott: You know we chatted up.

615
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,445
Scott: He was a nice guy just random con goer and he talked about like.

616
00:30:50,486 --> 00:30:53,179
Scott: yeah he's been playing Counter Strike since source.

617
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,529
Scott: And I was like.

618
00:30:54,793 --> 00:30:56,300
Rym: it's like we went to that panel at Magfest.

619
00:30:56,381 --> 00:30:59,100
Rym: the guys like I've been playing D&D for a long time.

620
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,567
Rym: I started with you know third edition.

621
00:31:08,305 --> 00:31:08,598
Scott: Man.

622
00:31:09,261 --> 00:31:10,739
Rym: Ah we're old now.

623
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,098
Rym: We're those guys.

624
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,297
Scott: Anyway.

625
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:19,219
Rym: So I think the game I'm most excited about that I didn't know about pre packs was a game called Aramac.

626
00:31:19,621 --> 00:31:24,178
Scott: I played Aramac for like a good 10 minutes while talking to one of the guys who worked on it.

627
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,590
Scott: And like it's.

628
00:31:25,611 --> 00:31:27,939
Scott: basically it's an action robotron plus RTS.

629
00:31:29,062 --> 00:31:29,286
Scott: It was.

630
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,020
Scott: it was great.

631
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,476
Scott: Only later and I was like comparing it to all these other games.

632
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:41,057
Scott: But only later did I realize that it's basically modern Herzog Zwee or Zwei or however he's supposed to say it.

633
00:31:41,925 --> 00:31:43,800
Rym: I had heard I heard that word.

634
00:31:43,841 --> 00:31:44,540
Rym: I'd seen those.

635
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:51,519
Scott: I knew that Herzog Zwei was a Genesis game but I didn't realize looking at Aramac that it was Herzog Zwei because I never played a lot of Herzog Zwei.

636
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,376
Scott: But now I do know.

637
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,799
Scott: But yeah Aramac looks hot.

638
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:56,254
Rym: It looks like it has.

639
00:31:56,335 --> 00:31:59,617
Rym: everything I like about RTS is without all the stuff I hate about RTS.

640
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,540
Scott: I played it for a long time.

641
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,509
Scott: I'm sold.

642
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:03,819
Scott: when it comes out I'm gonna pay for it.

643
00:32:04,161 --> 00:32:10,979
Rym: And actually World of Tanks despite my some issues I take with the business model and you know the design and everything.

644
00:32:11,605 --> 00:32:13,139
Rym: It looks actually really fun.

645
00:32:13,561 --> 00:32:15,558
Scott: I installed the demo disc that came in the goodie bag.

646
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,600
Scott: I'm going to try it out tonight.

647
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,339
Rym: They also had a German tank like a real one at the con and that was actually pretty cool.

648
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,800
Rym: It was cool.

649
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,235
Scott: Tank.

650
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:21,720
Rym: Yeah.

651
00:32:21,902 --> 00:32:26,359
Rym: Well they kept pointing it to people in the eye in the crowd like that that the gun they burned around.

652
00:32:26,743 --> 00:32:27,815
Rym: There's a pretty great picture of me.

653
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,415
Rym: They gave me the shell to hold on to.

654
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,129
Scott: Yeah.

655
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:30,636
Scott: Yeah.

656
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,020
Scott: Great.

657
00:32:31,892 --> 00:32:32,040
Rym: Yeah.

658
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,379
Rym: So you know the the the cornerstones of every packs.

659
00:32:37,025 --> 00:32:37,438
Rym: There's three.

660
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,009
Rym: There's like three that you have to see.

661
00:32:40,007 --> 00:32:41,499
Rym: One is the concerts which we don't have to see anymore.

662
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,120
Rym: Seen a million.

663
00:32:43,063 --> 00:32:43,940
Rym: It starts with the keynote.

664
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,900
Rym: It ends with the omega finale and no offense to Jaffe.

665
00:32:49,983 --> 00:32:52,859
Rym: This is the worst packs keynote I've ever seen.

666
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:53,793
Scott: Yeah.

667
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,275
Scott: I mean it started out.

668
00:32:55,497 --> 00:32:56,840
Scott: you know like I David Jaffe.

669
00:32:57,302 --> 00:33:07,138
Scott: All I knew about him was that he was an outspoken sort of Internet gaming personality and that he had worked on Twisted Metal which is the PlayStation game where you drive around in the clown car shooting other cars.

670
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:07,800
Scott: Great game.

671
00:33:07,922 --> 00:33:08,752
Scott: It's like versus 3D spa.

672
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:11,280
Scott: Spy Hunter not spy party.

673
00:33:12,126 --> 00:33:16,191
Scott: And I knew that he worked on God of War which is a Greek styling.

674
00:33:16,212 --> 00:33:21,717
Scott: you know action puzzly game with the third person camera walk around and hit things.

675
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,439
Rym: But I tweeted about it.

676
00:33:23,622 --> 00:33:24,079
Rym: I'm not going to wait.

677
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:29,917
Rym: But at one point I was just like is this going anywhere?

678
00:33:29,937 --> 00:33:33,000
Rym: because basically he just swore a whole bunch and he had a message.

679
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:45,500
Rym: he actually had a couple of really good messages like they are inspiring important messages but they were buried in a sea of obscenity personal rants that no one cares about personal drama and name dropping.

680
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:46,418
Scott: Yeah.

681
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:55,199
Scott: Like he pretty much told like his story of his career from his perspective you know and like what he went through to get from you know work.

682
00:33:55,521 --> 00:34:00,240
Rym: He went on forever about a lawsuit that really was not relevant.

683
00:34:00,941 --> 00:34:06,178
Scott: Yeah he like complained about the time he was sued a lot and he complained about like other people doubting him.

684
00:34:06,198 --> 00:34:07,360
Rym: and he complained about everything.

685
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,152
Rym: And I don't know I was just.

686
00:34:08,844 --> 00:34:11,518
Rym: it wasn't inspiring it was kind of rambly and ranty it was.

687
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:14,020
Rym: I was really underwhelmed.

688
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:17,297
Rym: It was the first time ever I've not been almost choked up by a keynote at PAX.

689
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:22,219
Rym: I mean you know even Will Wheaton got me a little choked up even though he played the woo game.

690
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,498
Rym: That's all he did.

691
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,858
Rym: Yeah but still it was a very.

692
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,199
Rym: it was kind of an inspiring talk.

693
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,346
Rym: He was like look this made us who we are.

694
00:34:28,487 --> 00:34:29,723
Rym: gaming makes us who we are.

695
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:31,779
Rym: let's celebrate the shit out of this.

696
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:38,920
Scott: I still think the best one that I've seen so far that I was at was the guy who worked at Lucas Arts.

697
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,820
Rym: Oh yeah well he gave a really solid speech.

698
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:42,679
Scott: What was his name?

699
00:34:42,841 --> 00:34:43,938
Rym: Also got me really choked up.

700
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,250
Rym: Jane McGonigal got me the most choked up.

701
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,500
Scott: Really choked up?

702
00:34:47,641 --> 00:34:49,638
Scott: I think hers was great but I wasn't choked up.

703
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:54,478
Rym: No just I got a little like not choked up like not like watching Madoka but more like.

704
00:34:55,266 --> 00:35:00,034
Rym: I was really like inspired and I just I thought about her speech a lot after I listened to it.

705
00:35:01,064 --> 00:35:05,000
Rym: The only thing I remember from Jeffrey's speech is fuck shit fuck ass vagina.

706
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:07,780
Scott: I don't mind swearing swear away right.

707
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,064
Scott: But look at the Penny Arcade guys.

708
00:35:09,104 --> 00:35:12,980
Scott: they swear but they're not just saying nothing but swears right.

709
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,110
Scott: It's like it wasn't?

710
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:15,166
Scott: it doesn't matter.

711
00:35:15,227 --> 00:35:22,838
Scott: he could have been saying some other word he could have been saying fufu but he said that you know it's like if you use any word repeatedly too many times no matter if it's a swear word or not.

712
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,699
Scott: That's you know it's like what.

713
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:39,799
Rym: About the only thing he had right was that he talked about how he realized eventually like in the course of all his work and everything that the games that actually remembered and that are actually popular and that are really good games from any kind of reasonably objective standard are the ones that are actually games.

714
00:35:40,361 --> 00:35:41,576
Scott: Yeah that was what.

715
00:35:41,596 --> 00:36:01,837
Scott: the only thing that I was pleased about was how you know this is one of those guys who wanted to go and be a filmmaker right but ended up being a game maker instead and wanted to be a visual storyteller couldn't get that job you know but could get a game making job but ended up making games that were mostly movies you know full of FMV's and story and whatnot.

716
00:36:01,897 --> 00:36:04,018
Scott: you know and that's you know the God of War and all that stuff.

717
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:20,638
Scott: So but the fact that that person realized that the games that are basically movies that you push buttons sometimes don't really have the staying power right and that the games of the staying power are the games that are games the Tetris the Sims.

718
00:36:20,658 --> 00:36:24,178
Scott: you know you may not like some of these games but these are the staying power games.

719
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,138
Rym: Oh here it is.

720
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:31,600
Scott: The fact that he learned the lesson that we've been trying to teach people is reassuring.

721
00:36:33,143 --> 00:36:41,686
Rym: So here's first I tweeted I'm like Jeff you said a new world record for the use of the word fuck vagina and fucking in a fax keynote and then a bunch of other stuff.

722
00:36:41,727 --> 00:36:48,010
Rym: and finally I'm like fuck fucking mother fucker shit Sony vagina fuck lawsuit high concept.

723
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:57,778
Rym: he said that like a hundred times fucking game mechanics fuck and people were quoting that as a summary of the keynote which is a pretty accurate summary.

724
00:36:58,061 --> 00:37:00,940
Scott: Yeah so I think you know pecs.

725
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,655
Scott: there's plenty of people out there that will write notes that will write here some.

726
00:37:04,675 --> 00:37:07,820
Scott: whatever it takes to get well right here are some suggestions will write.

727
00:37:07,963 --> 00:37:08,460
Rym: well right.

728
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,758
Scott: I don't know what kind of person he is.

729
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,260
Scott: You know what.

730
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,029
Rym: But what.

731
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:13,978
Rym: Get me a motto to do it.

732
00:37:14,282 --> 00:37:15,160
Scott: He can't speak English.

733
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:15,866
Rym: Who cares?

734
00:37:15,887 --> 00:37:16,376
Rym: translator?

735
00:37:16,396 --> 00:37:16,690
Rym: I don't care.

736
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,975
Scott: Another good choice would be.

737
00:37:18,995 --> 00:37:26,520
Scott: I don't know how you know how good his speaking skills are but you know in terms of accomplishments someone like Richard Garfield.

738
00:37:27,366 --> 00:37:28,979
Rym: I'd like to hear what Richard Garfield has to say.

739
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,120
Scott: Who invented Magic the Gathering.

740
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,293
Rym: Among other things.

741
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:32,418
Rym: it's not his only claim to fame.

742
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:32,881
Scott: Right?

743
00:37:32,962 --> 00:37:38,859
Scott: someone like the guy who made Outlaw and found that Activision made Pitfall that we talked about.

744
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:39,167
Scott: Yeah.

745
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:43,980
Rym: What about Yoichi Arakawa aka Ko Shibuusawa.

746
00:37:44,706 --> 00:37:45,692
Rym: I'd like to hear what he has to say.

747
00:37:46,206 --> 00:37:46,939
Scott: If he's good at it.

748
00:37:48,224 --> 00:38:01,380
Scott: You know there's plenty of people out there who have made you know great games and are very important people in the world of gaming that you didn't haven't had done keynotes that could go ahead of someone like David.

749
00:38:01,927 --> 00:38:09,517
Rym: I didn't know anything about Jaffe other than what he'd made going in and sorry dude but I kind of see why a lot of people hate on you.

750
00:38:11,843 --> 00:38:13,296
Rym: That was really uninspiring.

751
00:38:15,283 --> 00:38:16,179
Scott: You should work on that.

752
00:38:16,824 --> 00:38:21,479
Rym: But the Pinairgate Q&A is worth mentioning because one our friend Timo from Finland.

753
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,480
Scott: He scored an A+ at Q&A Ask.

754
00:38:24,684 --> 00:38:25,360
Rym: He goes up there.

755
00:38:25,461 --> 00:38:26,039
Rym: It's on YouTube.

756
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,458
Rym: But he basically is like.

757
00:38:28,085 --> 00:38:28,460
Rym: All right.

758
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,900
Rym: So I have the official Pax Candy.

759
00:38:30,121 --> 00:38:31,960
Rym: He has this candy from Scandinavia.

760
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,577
Rym: This is Pax.

761
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:33,540
Scott: Finland.

762
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:33,977
Rym: Yeah.

763
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:34,309
Rym: Yeah.

764
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,259
Rym: Well Scandinavia.

765
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:35,879
Rym: Where is Finland?

766
00:38:36,301 --> 00:38:36,797
Rym: In Scandinavia.

767
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,100
Rym: Yeah.

768
00:38:37,862 --> 00:38:39,559
Rym: He also had some Salmiakki.

769
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,396
Rym: You can figure out on your own what that is.

770
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:45,459
Rym: And he made them play Paper, Rock, Scissors to see who got to eat which one.

771
00:38:46,261 --> 00:38:47,957
Rym: And to their credit they followed through.

772
00:38:49,641 --> 00:38:52,639
Rym: More importantly Mike and Jerry, Gabe and Taiko.

773
00:38:54,341 --> 00:38:57,520
Rym: They've gone through a long journey I think of being.

774
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:02,319
Rym: You know the personalities that they are making the comic becoming kind of the rock stars of nerds.

775
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:07,460
Rym: It is really to their credit how good they have gotten at entertaining a crowd.

776
00:39:08,362 --> 00:39:09,996
Scott: Mike's sort of the same as he always was.

777
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,356
Scott: But Jerry definitely you know I've seen he's leveled up like Jerry.

778
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,800
Scott: I've seen him Q&A a bunch of times in a row now twice a year.

779
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,638
Scott: I see him do this.

780
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:22,316
Scott: And this time he was at least one or two levels above the last time he did it.

781
00:39:22,702 --> 00:39:24,859
Scott: Or any previous time I've seen him before.

782
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:28,217
Rym: To a degree that almost hurt on multiple occasions in the Q&A.

783
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,000
Scott: His A-ing skills at the Q-ing have increased greatly.

784
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,387
Scott: He is now you know epic level at the Q&A.

785
00:39:36,945 --> 00:39:39,578
Scott: I can't wait to see if he maintains that epic level at East.

786
00:39:40,704 --> 00:39:42,358
Rym: I don't think he can not maintain it.

787
00:39:42,861 --> 00:39:43,651
Scott: Yeah he's definitely.

788
00:39:43,711 --> 00:39:47,299
Scott: you know Mike's definitely got to up his game in some way.

789
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,960
Scott: You know he's Mike.

790
00:39:49,162 --> 00:39:49,820
Scott: He's got a good game.

791
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:50,759
Scott: He is how he is.

792
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,558
Scott: He's still a good game.

793
00:39:51,968 --> 00:39:52,440
Scott: But he's not.

794
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:52,904
Scott: He's got.

795
00:39:52,966 --> 00:39:54,417
Scott: if he leveled up it would be so epic.

796
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,165
Rym: Mike's like.

797
00:39:55,205 --> 00:39:57,839
Rym: he's got like a B6 at this but Jerry's just got.

798
00:39:57,982 --> 00:39:58,738
Rym: he's got G now.

799
00:39:59,180 --> 00:39:59,273
Rym: Yeah.

800
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,430
Rym: I don't know what to do about it.

801
00:40:00,681 --> 00:40:01,179
Scott: I don't know either.

802
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,280
Rym: If he goes white shade everyone will just empty their bottles simultaneously.

803
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,900
Scott: Well you won't even need questions anymore.

804
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:06,799
Scott: He'll just stand there.

805
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,535
Rym: He'll just be stand up comedy for an hour.

806
00:40:08,901 --> 00:40:09,845
Scott: He won't even be stand up comedy.

807
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,915
Scott: he'll just answer the questions that you were going to ask.

808
00:40:12,362 --> 00:40:12,452
Rym: Yep.

809
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:18,660
Rym: So you know last year I asked about ponies and I was like I should mess with him again.

810
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,639
Scott: Someone else did the ponies.

811
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,257
Rym: Yeah ponies were like.

812
00:40:22,127 --> 00:40:23,580
Scott: There are a lot of ponies at PAX.

813
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:24,099
Rym: Usually.

814
00:40:24,462 --> 00:40:24,598
Rym: Lots.

815
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,298
Rym: Last PAX.

816
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,919
Rym: Look how rapidly this has escalated.

817
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,019
Rym: Me and Scott were the only ones really pushing ponies.

818
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:30,675
Scott: At PAX East.

819
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,296
Rym: Like we played the PMV.

820
00:40:32,821 --> 00:40:34,278
Rym: We mentioned ponies in the panel.

821
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,420
Rym: I asked about ponies in the Q&A.

822
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,200
Scott: Well it's just because we're ahead of the geek curve right.

823
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,999
Scott: We read the Internet almost every day.

824
00:40:39,241 --> 00:40:39,839
Scott: We're so awesome.

825
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:40,150
Scott: Right.

826
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:48,700
Scott: And we look at the Internet and we see what's hot and we explore down every path and we explore in many different geekeries not just tech.

827
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,519
Scott: Dude by the time.

828
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,860
Scott: Not just gaming not just comics.

829
00:40:50,962 --> 00:40:51,409
Scott: not you know.

830
00:40:51,429 --> 00:40:53,039
Rym: we got by the time we covered it out.

831
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:57,020
Rym: We had already made a pilot of a show called Radio Free Equestria exactly on YouTube.

832
00:40:57,283 --> 00:40:58,799
Scott: So it's like we're ahead of every curve.

833
00:40:59,002 --> 00:41:03,257
Scott: But you know and it's like we were playing DDR and then everyone was playing DDR and we're watching ponies.

834
00:41:03,298 --> 00:41:03,979
Scott: then everyone's playing.

835
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:09,996
Scott: If you want to make investment decisions just listen to whatever we talk about that isn't popular yet and assume it's going to be popular.

836
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,318
Rym: So apparently farts.

837
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:12,353
Scott: No.

838
00:41:13,029 --> 00:41:13,200
Scott: Sure.

839
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,232
Rym: So big.

840
00:41:14,881 --> 00:41:20,840
Rym: We're also really behind the curve or at least we're holders because we played Counter Strike before most people played it.

841
00:41:21,547 --> 00:41:24,000
Rym: You still play it after most people don't play it anymore.

842
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,139
Scott: That's true.

843
00:41:27,182 --> 00:41:28,300
Rym: But it's comeback.

844
00:41:28,782 --> 00:41:30,480
Rym: We like the ponies were everywhere.

845
00:41:30,761 --> 00:41:34,480
Rym: I didn't have to say a goddamn thing about ponies at this whole convention.

846
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:34,835
Rym: Ponies.

847
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,260
Rym: Someone brought an eight foot tall like Pinkie Pie just like at to the convention.

848
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,639
Scott: I didn't see it but I saw a video of it.

849
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:42,260
Scott: There are pony cosplayers.

850
00:41:42,963 --> 00:41:43,975
Scott: There's a lot of button.

851
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:45,219
Scott: ears had pony buttons.

852
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,079
Rym: There was a derpy hooves in the maker strip.

853
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,820
Scott: That's two maker strips in a row where we've added ponies.

854
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:50,948
Scott: Yeah.

855
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:51,999
Rym: What the fuck guys.

856
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,019
Rym: Two maker strips.

857
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,520
Rym: There's only two of these a year and we are now batting a thousand.

858
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:57,656
Scott: We need to.

859
00:41:58,723 --> 00:42:00,140
Rym: And neither one of these was us.

860
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,920
Rym: It was not me or Scott getting this in there.

861
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:03,780
Rym: This is just unrelated.

862
00:42:03,881 --> 00:42:05,780
Scott: We did not push any pony.

863
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,539
Scott: But meanwhile the Unicorn Theater had ponies outside of it.

864
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,900
Scott: So did the Manicourt Theater.

865
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:10,313
Rym: Yeah.

866
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,900
Rym: The enforcers were like pony fucking central.

867
00:42:14,321 --> 00:42:15,238
Scott: Everybody pony in.

868
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,418
Scott: Every day they pony in.

869
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,244
Rym: I don't know what to do about it.

870
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:20,179
Scott: I don't know.

871
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:20,900
Scott: More hustling.

872
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,454
Scott: Less ponying.

873
00:42:21,843 --> 00:42:21,911
Rym: Yup.

874
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,140
Scott: Season two's coming.

875
00:42:24,183 --> 00:42:24,779
Rym: Oh my god.

876
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,799
Rym: I'm not going to say anything else about that.

877
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,180
Rym: So we did one panel.

878
00:42:30,261 --> 00:42:31,140
Rym: It was an okay panel.

879
00:42:31,621 --> 00:42:32,340
Rym: It was an experiment.

880
00:42:33,243 --> 00:42:34,060
Rym: And we tried it out.

881
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,939
Rym: I learned a lot about how to do that kind of panel.

882
00:42:36,581 --> 00:42:37,120
Rym: And if we ever do.

883
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:40,480
Scott: I thought we would be spending a lot more time actually playing the games but.

884
00:42:40,681 --> 00:42:43,780
Rym: I think we would have if we had fewer games to play.

885
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,679
Scott: I think if we actually would have been better off with more games to play.

886
00:42:47,101 --> 00:42:47,800
Rym: I think it would have been fewer.

887
00:42:47,902 --> 00:42:49,677
Rym: but we should have had a match or bring some of them to the audience.

888
00:42:49,962 --> 00:42:50,158
Rym: Oh yeah.

889
00:42:50,341 --> 00:42:52,099
Scott: We could have brought people from the audience to actually play it.

890
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:52,800
Rym: Panel was okay.

891
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:56,360
Rym: But the thing I really want to talk about because this was an experiment for PEX.

892
00:42:56,901 --> 00:42:59,940
Rym: They did the tabletop workshops and the GMing workshops area.

893
00:43:00,542 --> 00:43:02,378
Rym: So we went up and for two hours we took over the room.

894
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,236
Rym: We videoed it.

895
00:43:03,903 --> 00:43:07,000
Rym: And we taught everyone in there how to play Carcassonne, Puerto Rico and Seven Wonders.

896
00:43:07,942 --> 00:43:09,479
Rym: And the people there loved it.

897
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:10,357
Rym: I think it was a great thing.

898
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,499
Scott: There were very few people.

899
00:43:12,101 --> 00:43:13,320
Scott: And it was in a hidden room.

900
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:15,360
Scott: It was not in any schedule.

901
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:16,508
Scott: So I'm amazed.

902
00:43:16,589 --> 00:43:17,339
Scott: anyone showed up.

903
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,640
Scott: But the fact that people showed up stayed and totally dug it.

904
00:43:20,805 --> 00:43:21,140
Rym: Of course.

905
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,040
Scott: What was funny meant that our idea was actually a good idea.

906
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,760
Scott: It was a good test of our idea.

907
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:26,679
Rym: Prove that it was worthwhile.

908
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:27,340
Rym: together.

909
00:43:27,642 --> 00:43:29,064
Rym: They really put all the effort in.

910
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,140
Rym: They did everything right.

911
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,340
Rym: And we're talking to help out.

912
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,919
Scott: They actually showed up with the games we needed.

913
00:43:34,441 --> 00:43:38,139
Rym: We're talking to help them out and do this ten times over at PAX East if we can.

914
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:38,512
Rym: Hope so.

915
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:45,952
Rym: But the funny and sad part was that at the end of the session we're like, "Yeah, so how many of you know who we

916
00:43:46,097 --> 00:43:46,179
Rym: are?"

917
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:46,893
Rym: And everyone's like,

918
00:43:46,913 --> 00:43:47,158
Rym: "Yeah.".

919
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:49,294
Scott: That was kind of sad.

920
00:43:49,314 --> 00:43:53,853
Scott: is that at our panel, which is a little more than half full, I was like, "Who knows who we

921
00:43:53,997 --> 00:43:54,079
Scott: are?".

922
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,440
Scott: And most people knew who we were.

923
00:43:55,601 --> 00:43:56,051
Rym: It was like,

924
00:43:56,072 --> 00:43:56,133
Rym: "Ugh.".

925
00:43:56,526 --> 00:43:56,720
Rym: I know.

926
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,540
Rym: It used to be like no one knew who we were and by the end they're like fawning over us.

927
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,200
Rym: Now it's like we got this GeekNights fan base at PAX.

928
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,019
Scott: We got to change the name of the panel to get people who don't know who we are to show up.

929
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,658
Rym: Well, I'm going to tell you guys a secret right now.

930
00:44:08,801 --> 00:44:14,437
Rym: There's a good chance the panel we're going to do, at least our new panel at PAX East, I'm going to lay an egg out right now.

931
00:44:15,143 --> 00:44:18,499
Rym: It's called Let's Play Money Making Game.

932
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,059
Scott: We should just, in the description, be like, "Come to this panel.

933
00:44:22,221 --> 00:44:22,909
Scott: You might make

934
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:23,294
Scott: money.".

935
00:44:24,684 --> 00:44:26,490
Rym: I think we should say, "Or pay me for the

936
00:44:26,552 --> 00:44:26,758
Rym: door.".

937
00:44:26,861 --> 00:44:27,520
Rym: That's the whole description.

938
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,138
Scott: Pay me for the door repair charge.

939
00:44:30,663 --> 00:44:32,939
Scott: Come to this panel, pay for the door repair charge.

940
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,318
Scott: Maybe walk out with cash.

941
00:44:37,301 --> 00:44:41,999
Rym: But so the table that works out there really well, but even at that, everyone there knew who he works with except one guy.

942
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,660
Rym: So we're like, "Yeah, so if you guys like this, check out Geek

943
00:44:45,763 --> 00:44:45,993
Rym: Nights.".

944
00:44:46,181 --> 00:44:47,268
Rym: Everyone's like, "Yeah, yeah, whatever,

945
00:44:47,288 --> 00:44:47,554
Rym: blah.".

946
00:44:48,062 --> 00:44:48,546
Rym: One guy's like,

947
00:44:48,586 --> 00:44:48,788
Rym: "What?".

948
00:44:52,327 --> 00:44:53,000
Rym: It was just kind of funny.

949
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,040
Rym: But our panel wasn't full.

950
00:44:55,705 --> 00:44:58,100
Rym: The whole back of the room was Didn't feel like any of the panels were full.

951
00:44:58,562 --> 00:45:03,140
Scott: People kept lining up for panels, but then the panel room would not be full once people went in.

952
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:09,753
Rym: I was talking to a lot of enforcers about this, and yeah, panel attendance is down except for the things that always fill up.

953
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,000
Rym: So all the Penny Arcade stuff.

954
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,539
Scott: Well, there are more panel rooms.

955
00:45:12,963 --> 00:45:16,099
Rym: But the Penny Arcade stuff fills no matter what room they put it And the rooms are bigger.

956
00:45:17,645 --> 00:45:25,054
Rym: The Penny Arcade-ish or related or like the same level stuff, like Wil Wheaton does a panel, it'll fill up.

957
00:45:25,843 --> 00:45:28,076
Rym: Or they do like the D&D game they play.

958
00:45:28,624 --> 00:45:28,896
Rym: Yeah.

959
00:45:29,221 --> 00:45:29,939
Rym: That stuff is filled up.

960
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:30,940
Scott: That stuff all fills.

961
00:45:31,221 --> 00:45:34,120
Rym: As are the panels for games that people really fucking care about.

962
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,267
Scott: Like, "Oh my God, this panel is where...".

963
00:45:36,803 --> 00:45:37,180
Scott: What was that?

964
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:38,480
Scott: I think like Borderlands 2.

965
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,588
Scott: Didn't they give everyone like beta codes or something like that?

966
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:48,338
Rym: I heard the "Pitch Your Game" panel fills up and still fills up, but that's apparently really participatory and really funny and people enjoy it.

967
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:51,180
Rym: But most of the panels at PAX don't fill up anymore.

968
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:58,420
Rym: And I think, personally, this is my opinion, is because, one, most of the panels are kind of the same every year.

969
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,808
Rym: Like, "Oh, here's the panel about girls and

970
00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:01,236
Rym: gaming.".

971
00:46:01,581 --> 00:46:04,819
Rym: The panel goes like this, "Hey, there's girls who play games.

972
00:46:05,021 --> 00:46:06,216
Rym: Don't be hating on us.

973
00:46:07,422 --> 00:46:08,996
Rym: Don't be ragging on

974
00:46:09,117 --> 00:46:09,198
Rym: us.".

975
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:09,879
Rym: Like, yeah.

976
00:46:10,705 --> 00:46:11,751
Rym: Bring something else to the table.

977
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:12,480
Rym: I'm sorry.

978
00:46:13,543 --> 00:46:14,620
Rym: We've talked about that before.

979
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:15,838
Rym: We don't need to talk about it again.

980
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:22,020
Scott: No, one thing I do want to talk about, which I made a YouTube video talking about, was the Omegathon finale, right?

981
00:46:22,282 --> 00:46:22,999
Scott: Oh my God.

982
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,239
Scott: So the Omegathon is always awesome.

983
00:46:25,724 --> 00:46:28,520
Scott: I'm going to keep my "Rock 'Em Suck 'Em Robots" guess until it happens.

984
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,857
Rym: I will maintain "Crossfire" just because.

985
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,413
Scott: You got to know

986
00:46:32,514 --> 00:46:33,020
Scott: "Crossfire.".

987
00:46:33,101 --> 00:46:36,019
Rym: If they play that song, people will lose their goddamn shit.

988
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:36,680
Scott: That's right.

989
00:46:37,443 --> 00:46:37,720
Rym: But anyway.

990
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:38,318
Rym: Sorry, wait, wait.

991
00:46:38,746 --> 00:46:39,499
Rym: To Jaffeize that.

992
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,819
Rym: Goddamn motherfucking vagina ass fuck shit.

993
00:46:43,214 --> 00:46:43,339
Scott: Anyway.

994
00:46:44,022 --> 00:46:44,940
Scott: So, Omegathon finale.

995
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:45,697
Scott: We line up.

996
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,460
Scott: We get in there.

997
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:47,379
Scott: We're sitting pretty high up.

998
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,498
Scott: We can see well enough.

999
00:46:49,521 --> 00:46:50,780
Scott: The big reveal comes.

1000
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:52,020
Scott: You know, final countdown.

1001
00:46:52,661 --> 00:46:53,800
Scott: Bring out two Omeganauts.

1002
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:54,760
Scott: They look high quality.

1003
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:55,437
Scott: Omeganauts.

1004
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:55,930
Rym: Yup.

1005
00:46:56,403 --> 00:46:59,700
Scott: Most of the Omegathon games that year were mostly skill-based.

1006
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:00,819
Scott: Very, very good.

1007
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:01,272
Rym: Yup.

1008
00:47:01,741 --> 00:47:02,438
Rym: Bananagrams, yo.

1009
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:03,780
Scott: Bananagrams, excellent choice.

1010
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,600
Rym: Also, the Omegathon finale is in the Paramount Theater, which is nice.

1011
00:47:06,984 --> 00:47:07,259
Rym: Awesome.

1012
00:47:07,402 --> 00:47:08,380
Rym: It is a choice venue.

1013
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:08,855
Scott: Yup.

1014
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,819
Scott: So, reveal comes.

1015
00:47:11,441 --> 00:47:12,600
Scott: Not Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots.

1016
00:47:13,301 --> 00:47:14,400
Scott: Not Crossfire.

1017
00:47:15,483 --> 00:47:16,660
Rym: Zelda 1.

1018
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,320
Rym: Now, at this point, you know, it's something very important.

1019
00:47:19,984 --> 00:47:23,647
Scott: Everyone, as soon as that music plays, everyone is just like, "Fuck

1020
00:47:23,791 --> 00:47:24,140
Scott: yes.".

1021
00:47:24,281 --> 00:47:29,080
Rym: The reason to be at the Omegathon finale is just for the way the crowd reacts.

1022
00:47:29,281 --> 00:47:37,239
Rym: You know, at the end of a tied hockey game for the Stanley Cup, the way the crowd is standing up and yelling, you get that about a video game.

1023
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,741
Rym: So, Zelda 1.

1024
00:47:39,741 --> 00:47:40,520
Scott: Oh, shit, son.

1025
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:41,138
Scott: It is on.

1026
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:41,939
Scott: How do you win?

1027
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:48,640
Scott: First person to get a Triforce fragment wins, which is understandable considering the time constraints, right?

1028
00:47:49,062 --> 00:47:51,480
Scott: So, but then, something else happened, right?

1029
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:57,380
Scott: They were like, you know, before they revealed the game, they asked the Omeganauts to choose from amongst the failed Omeganauts.

1030
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,439
Rym: For a spirit animal.

1031
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:02,559
Scott: For a spirit animal, a spirit guide to assist them.

1032
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:04,758
Scott: So, that was like, oh, is this gonna be co-op?

1033
00:48:05,021 --> 00:48:07,718
Scott: They gave these people-- It's gonna be doubles Mario Tennis.

1034
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:08,920
Rym: They gave these people facts.

1035
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:16,398
Scott: Well, after the reveal of Zelda 1, they said, so I'm like, well, if it's Zelda 1 and it's first to get a Triforce fragment-- Blindfolded?

1036
00:48:16,721 --> 00:48:18,620
Scott: What is the spirit animal for?

1037
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,060
Scott: What is the spirit guide for?

1038
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:24,235
Scott: And we're thinking, blindfolded Zelda 1, blindfolded Zelda 1, fuck yes, fuck yes, fuck.

1039
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:24,479
Scott: yes.

1040
00:48:25,364 --> 00:48:26,520
Scott: It wasn't blindfolded.

1041
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:31,700
Scott: They gave the spirit animal a fact to guide the player.

1042
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:36,720
Scott: Now, this is understandable because let's say neither person knew Zelda 1.

1043
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,679
Scott: They were nubs who'd never played it before, right?

1044
00:48:39,323 --> 00:48:41,260
Scott: In that case, we would've been there for hours.

1045
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,360
Scott: What if they went left?

1046
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:43,380
Scott: What if they went right?

1047
00:48:43,662 --> 00:48:43,892
Scott: So, Scott.

1048
00:48:44,542 --> 00:48:45,720
Scott: They would've died a hundred times.

1049
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:50,460
Scott: They might never have found the first Triforce piece without that map that comes with the game.

1050
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,460
Rym: This is why that's bullshit.

1051
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:52,800
Rym: They shouldn't have given the people a fact.

1052
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,340
Rym: them the Zelda 1 instruction book.

1053
00:48:55,461 --> 00:48:55,840
Rym: That's true.

1054
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,220
Scott: Zelda 1 instruction book and the map that came with Zelda 1.

1055
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,288
Rym: Because that would've been enough and that would've been cool.

1056
00:49:01,869 --> 00:49:02,060
Scott: Right.

1057
00:49:02,162 --> 00:49:03,534
Scott: But I want to point out something.

1058
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,238
Rym: The contest was get a piece of the Triforce.

1059
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:10,720
Rym: I feel like had I been up there, this would've been a disaster.

1060
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:11,530
Rym: done.

1061
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,234
Rym: guy and said, "Dungeon

1062
00:49:14,234 --> 00:49:17,344
Rym: 2?".

1063
00:49:17,344 --> 00:49:19,879
Rym: And then I would've gotten it, but I would've gone to Dungeon 1 anyway.

1064
00:49:20,961 --> 00:49:22,999
Scott: Yeah, it's a trip to Japan is on the line.

1065
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,020
Scott: You can't go to Dungeon 2.

1066
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:28,880
Rym: Saying Dungeon 2 does not say I'm going to Dungeon 2.

1067
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,922
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, maybe the guy would agree to go to Dungeon 2.

1068
00:49:31,922 --> 00:49:32,819
Rym: Well then you got to do it.

1069
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:33,977
Scott: You got to get bombs though.

1070
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:35,271
Scott: Yeah.

1071
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:38,699
Rym: Or they could've been like, they could've just gone around buying and getting money.

1072
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:39,839
Rym: They could've really.

1073
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,580
Scott: Yeah, plus who knows what that fact said.

1074
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,980
Scott: It could've been a speed run fact.

1075
00:49:43,463 --> 00:49:43,792
Scott: Who knows?

1076
00:49:44,344 --> 00:49:44,518
Scott: Anyway.

1077
00:49:45,621 --> 00:49:50,520
Scott: So they gave them a fact, which is understandable because if the players were not familiar with Zelda 1, we would've been there forever.

1078
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:51,300
Scott: Right?

1079
00:49:51,540 --> 00:50:00,300
Scott: Number two, if one player was familiar and one player was not, it would've been incredibly unentertaining for the crowd to watch one person dominate and the other person get lost.

1080
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,277
Rym: Kinda like why Dance.

1081
00:50:01,297 --> 00:50:07,765
Rym: Dance Revolution will never be the Omegathon finale because you either are awesome at DDR or it's not fun to watch you play DDR.

1082
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:09,780
Rym: There's no middle ground there.

1083
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:10,820
Scott: There's a huge component of.

1084
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:13,119
Scott: they always want it to be really close, right?

1085
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,800
Scott: They want it to be entertaining for the crowd.

1086
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:16,878
Rym: I'm amazed at how close it is every year.

1087
00:50:17,122 --> 00:50:17,235
Scott: I am.

1088
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,560
Scott: I think they do incredible amounts of testing, right?

1089
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,460
Scott: They test the crane.

1090
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:25,277
Scott: They test everything to make sure that it's going to be really close.

1091
00:50:26,904 --> 00:50:29,295
Scott: They change the rules just to make sure.

1092
00:50:29,642 --> 00:50:31,780
Scott: They maximize crowd entertainment.

1093
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,871
Scott: They don't maximize fair competition or anything like that.

1094
00:50:36,341 --> 00:50:40,280
Scott: So in that regards, excellent job, you know, perfectly reasonable.

1095
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:49,920
Scott: But if you don't know how to get the first piece of the Triforce in Zelda 1 as quickly as possible, how are you even in the Omegathon?

1096
00:50:50,822 --> 00:50:53,215
Rym: Scott and I, what's funny is, you know, the guy on the left.

1097
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:54,820
Scott: How are you even at PAX?

1098
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,813
Scott: How can you call yourself a gamer?

1099
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:03,920
Scott: That's like, you know, people call themselves a lot of things, Like, you know, you identify yourself based on things you do.

1100
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,458
Scott: You might say, oh, yes, I am a singer.

1101
00:51:06,841 --> 00:51:08,380
Scott: Well, what have you sung?

1102
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:09,360
Scott: Nothing.

1103
00:51:10,623 --> 00:51:12,740
Scott: Oh, yes, I'm a big fan of Broadway.

1104
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:15,400
Scott: Well, have you seen Phantom of the Opera?

1105
00:51:15,541 --> 00:51:15,731
Scott: No.

1106
00:51:16,121 --> 00:51:16,790
Scott: Have you seen Cats?

1107
00:51:17,661 --> 00:51:18,379
Scott: No, never.

1108
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,758
Scott: Now, had this been like...

1109
00:51:20,665 --> 00:51:20,707
Rym: No.

1110
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,992
Rym: Had they started them at Death Mountain and been like, Beganon?

1111
00:51:24,822 --> 00:51:26,520
Rym: Okay, I'd understand if people had some trouble.

1112
00:51:26,743 --> 00:51:27,059
Rym: Right.

1113
00:51:27,282 --> 00:51:35,078
Scott: But it's like, you call yourself a gamer and you identify yourself as a gamer enough such that, A, you go into PAX.

1114
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,378
Scott: B, you're signing up for the Omegathon.

1115
00:51:37,963 --> 00:51:39,839
Scott: D, you're good enough to get to the end of the Omegathon.

1116
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:40,308
Rym: And C.

1117
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,719
Scott: And E, you've never played Zelda 1 and you need a pack.

1118
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:52,739
Rym: No, no, no, Scott, to be fair, I can understand if someone, they knew where the first dungeon was, but they didn't remember exactly where Aquamentis was.

1119
00:51:53,265 --> 00:51:54,320
Rym: I can understand that.

1120
00:51:54,942 --> 00:52:05,060
Scott: That's fine, because then at least if you've at least played it, even if you weren't the master of it, which is understandable, it would still be pretty interesting to see you bump around in Dungeon 1.

1121
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,976
Rym: But the guy on the right went right.

1122
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:07,907
Rym: Yeah.

1123
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,959
Scott: And wandered off and then his spirit animal was like, No, no, no, no, no, no.

1124
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,938
Scott: And the spirit animal could not point at the screen.

1125
00:52:13,345 --> 00:52:16,217
Scott: They could only talk and read the pack, which is good.

1126
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,560
Scott: But still very disappointed.

1127
00:52:20,385 --> 00:52:20,615
Scott: Very.

1128
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,960
Rym: However, it was great because the competition was close anyway.

1129
00:52:24,364 --> 00:52:26,378
Rym: The person with better skill clearly won.

1130
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:33,119
Rym: And more importantly, there's this moment where the guy on the left is in the dungeon and he's going toward the wrong door.

1131
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,160
Rym: And Scott and I lost our shit.

1132
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,580
Rym: I was yelling louder than I've ever let.

1133
00:52:36,901 --> 00:52:37,607
Scott: He was toward the door.

1134
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:39,956
Scott: He went north.

1135
00:52:42,404 --> 00:52:43,200
Scott: Here's the thing on your right.

1136
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:48,360
Scott: So he went north towards the bow, killed a few Staphloses, and then went south.

1137
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,970
Scott: Now, I was told later that apparently he did this to get a heart.

1138
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:56,580
Scott: But that is the most retarded thing ever, because number one, you shouldn't have gotten hit.

1139
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,279
Scott: But you already hit.

1140
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:58,720
Scott: So you need the heart to get full health.

1141
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:02,300
Scott: Well, the guy on the right died outside of the dungeon.

1142
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,660
Scott: You need the magic sword to shoot Aquamentus, because getting the bow takes too long.

1143
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,720
Scott: And you know where you're going to get arrows anyway.

1144
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:09,599
Scott: So it's understandable.

1145
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:10,599
Rym: But arrows.

1146
00:53:11,622 --> 00:53:11,732
Rym: Right.

1147
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:22,495
Scott: But but if you needed hearts, you could have killed the master hands in the room before The master hands was actually quite a tense moment.

1148
00:53:22,596 --> 00:53:25,983
Rym: because because the thing is, but you know, the guy needed the key, right?

1149
00:53:26,307 --> 00:53:29,640
Rym: The key ended up being in the bottom right and the hands.

1150
00:53:29,681 --> 00:53:31,355
Rym: that's where the cat kept coming out.

1151
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:33,878
Scott: And the key is always in the bottom right.

1152
00:53:34,041 --> 00:53:34,264
Scott: Yeah.

1153
00:53:34,304 --> 00:53:37,500
Rym: But the first guy got in like the hands, like you just avoided him right away.

1154
00:53:37,844 --> 00:53:38,859
Rym: The first guy just missed him.

1155
00:53:39,304 --> 00:53:42,278
Rym: And there was just like four hands in a row came up right on the key.

1156
00:53:43,104 --> 00:53:44,400
Scott: So I went yesterday.

1157
00:53:44,482 --> 00:53:45,280
Scott: I made a YouTube video.

1158
00:53:45,382 --> 00:53:45,939
Scott: You can watch it.

1159
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:52,738
Scott: I did a test where I tried to do the Omega-Thon finale challenge of get the Triforce piece as quickly as possible.

1160
00:53:53,266 --> 00:53:54,180
Scott: I turned on an emulator.

1161
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:55,092
Scott: I plugged an Xbox 360 controller.

1162
00:53:56,445 --> 00:53:59,259
Scott: I created a new game and I just went for it.

1163
00:53:59,440 --> 00:53:59,898
Scott: First try.

1164
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:01,519
Scott: I didn't get hit once.

1165
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:03,158
Scott: Not once at all.

1166
00:54:04,403 --> 00:54:06,519
Scott: I did it in about two minutes in a few seconds.

1167
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:12,436
Scott: And in that room with the master hands, I just walked over, grabbed the key and walked right up without touching any of the master hands.

1168
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,166
Scott: And, you know, I wasn't speed running or anything.

1169
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:16,780
Scott: There's plenty of time.

1170
00:54:17,061 --> 00:54:18,299
Rym: So Scott, here's what I did.

1171
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:22,000
Scott: There's plenty of times where I go slow, like I just walk into a tree for a few seconds.

1172
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:22,333
Scott: Yeah.

1173
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,840
Scott: You know, stuff like that that happens in Zelda one.

1174
00:54:25,144 --> 00:54:26,260
Rym: So here's what I would have done.

1175
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,059
Rym: This is just what I would have done if I were Mike and Jerry.

1176
00:54:29,901 --> 00:54:32,320
Rym: So same exact competition with the same exact fact.

1177
00:54:33,405 --> 00:54:34,586
Rym: It would have been the second quest.

1178
00:54:34,647 --> 00:54:35,936
Rym: I wouldn't have said shit about that.

1179
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:37,279
Scott: Fuck yeah.

1180
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:38,860
Rym: Just imagine.

1181
00:54:40,602 --> 00:54:42,960
Rym: Everything would be fine until they get into that dungeon.

1182
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:46,878
Scott: Well, you would have known because you would have seen the sword on the opening character select screen.

1183
00:54:47,763 --> 00:54:49,480
Rym: I would have come up with somewhere around that.

1184
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,360
Rym: I would have started the game paused or something.

1185
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:55,158
Scott: But then you couldn't have had the epic reveal where the music plays.

1186
00:54:55,642 --> 00:54:57,758
Rym: I could have had the reveal and then some save states.

1187
00:54:59,121 --> 00:55:00,800
Scott: But they weren't using emulators using real NES.

1188
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:01,960
Rym: Which is dangerous.

1189
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,020
Scott: It's the only fair way.

1190
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:03,960
Rym: It's fair, but it's dangerous.

1191
00:55:04,921 --> 00:55:06,577
Scott: Not if you've tested the NES as thoroughly.

1192
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,519
Rym: Yeah, but NES could glitch out of nowhere.

1193
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:11,220
Scott: No, they get top loaders or in toasters or something.

1194
00:55:12,021 --> 00:55:16,180
Scott: Anyway, slight disappointment with gamers worldwide not playing Zelda one.

1195
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,960
Scott: If you listening to this have not played and beaten Zelda one at least the first quest.

1196
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:20,378
Rym: Stop right now.

1197
00:55:20,481 --> 00:55:21,260
Rym: Don't even listen anymore.

1198
00:55:21,562 --> 00:55:22,119
Rym: You are.

1199
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,019
Scott: You do not count.

1200
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:23,398
Scott: You are.

1201
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,320
Scott: Instead, every you have no pride.

1202
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,460
Scott: All your pride is erased.

1203
00:55:27,602 --> 00:55:29,653
Scott: Instead, you are covered in a mountain of shame.

1204
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,920
Rym: You don't have to remove this mountain of shame.

1205
00:55:33,001 --> 00:55:35,277
Scott: You must beat Zelda one first quest.

1206
00:55:35,401 --> 00:55:36,980
Rym: You don't have to beat the second quest.

1207
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,140
Scott: Do not use a fact.

1208
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:41,977
Scott: You can only look at a map of the very beginning of the game that came with Zelda one.

1209
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:46,260
Scott: If you need a JPEG of this map or the instruction manual, I'm sure you can find it on Google.

1210
00:55:46,984 --> 00:55:49,739
Scott: I think that's the only equipment you are allowed to use.

1211
00:55:50,062 --> 00:55:53,120
Rym: I wonder like I can't imagine how I found some of that stuff.

1212
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:54,619
Rym: I think I just burned every fucking bush.

1213
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:56,937
Scott: I burned every bush.

1214
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:58,774
Rym: With a blue candle.

1215
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:03,960
Scott: I burned a lot of bushes with a blue candle, but I got the red candle eventually.

1216
00:56:04,201 --> 00:56:06,720
Rym: I was so excited when I got that red fucking candle.

1217
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,879
Scott: I burned so many goddamn bushes with the red candle.

1218
00:56:11,924 --> 00:56:15,740
Scott: If I was burning bushes in real life, I'd be like the most crazy arsonist ever.

1219
00:56:16,062 --> 00:56:17,000
Rym: Moses would be proud.

1220
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,977
Scott: Is there any other pecs?

1221
00:56:19,261 --> 00:56:20,777
Rym: So there's one other thing we should talk about.

1222
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,858
Rym: Con seemed a lot more crowded this year.

1223
00:56:23,402 --> 00:56:25,899
Rym: One thing is they may have sold more badges.

1224
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,219
Rym: The other thing was that panel attendance is down.

1225
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,240
Rym: And Halo Fest took up a whole bunch of space without a lot of content.

1226
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,539
Rym: So it might have pushed more people into the gaming areas.

1227
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:38,339
Rym: But there was some counterfeit badges.

1228
00:56:38,944 --> 00:56:40,800
Scott: I'm sure there were counterfeit badges in the past.

1229
00:56:41,544 --> 00:56:44,140
Scott: But this year there was a counterfeit badge epidemic.

1230
00:56:44,301 --> 00:56:46,760
Rym: I would guess there were 500 to 1,000 counterfeit badges.

1231
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,413
Scott: There was a lot of counterfeit badges.

1232
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,220
Rym: That's me guessing.

1233
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,018
Rym: That's not based on anything Pags told us.

1234
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,260
Rym: But Pags gave us as a gift.

1235
00:56:53,481 --> 00:56:54,858
Rym: We're calling them Zdars now.

1236
00:56:55,783 --> 00:56:59,458
Scott: If you don't know, in Mario Party, a negative star is a zdar.

1237
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:04,939
Rym: Which is kind of famous for us because we were in -- this was the same time we had the bamboo and the vision.

1238
00:57:05,542 --> 00:57:05,737
Scott: Yes.

1239
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:10,499
Rym: But we were playing Mario Party for the championship belt teams.

1240
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:12,960
Rym: And we weren't doing that well.

1241
00:57:13,061 --> 00:57:13,579
Rym: We were doing okay.

1242
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:14,277
Rym: We were holding our own.

1243
00:57:14,662 --> 00:57:15,140
Scott: It was tied.

1244
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:18,597
Rym: In one round, the other team got a star.

1245
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,039
Rym: Gave us a zdar.

1246
00:57:22,061 --> 00:57:25,618
Rym: We got another zdar because of a Bowser game.

1247
00:57:26,441 --> 00:57:29,819
Rym: And random bullshit gave us another zdar.

1248
00:57:30,261 --> 00:57:30,759
Scott: It was bullshit.

1249
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,259
Rym: In one round we went from neck and neck to there is no hope.

1250
00:57:35,421 --> 00:57:36,360
Rym: There was no Obi-Wan.

1251
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:36,959
Scott: And we lost.

1252
00:57:37,681 --> 00:57:38,259
Rym: And then the bamboo.

1253
00:57:40,913 --> 00:57:41,120
Scott: Anyway.

1254
00:57:41,783 --> 00:57:43,120
Rym: So these are zdars.

1255
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,920
Rym: They're like -- it's like an anti-artifact.

1256
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:50,140
Rym: But there were some pretty sophisticated counterfeit badges and I'm amazed.

1257
00:57:51,065 --> 00:57:56,099
Rym: This is one of the reasons why, you know, on the east coast a lot of the fan cons are really afraid of counterfeit badges.

1258
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:01,960
Rym: But one, I've seen counterfeit badges on the east coast and they're like baby's first counterfeit.

1259
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:02,558
Scott: They're jokes.

1260
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,858
Rym: It's like, kid, you have a black and white photocopy and you put some tinfoil where the hologram is.

1261
00:58:09,024 --> 00:58:09,259
Rym: Really?

1262
00:58:10,281 --> 00:58:11,580
Rym: Or you've got last year's badge.

1263
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:12,397
Rym: You thought that would work.

1264
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:13,038
Scott: Yeah.

1265
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:16,270
Rym: But at the same time, that does work.

1266
00:58:17,561 --> 00:58:25,819
Rym: At Otakon and Katsucon and all the east coast cons, seriously, baby's first counterfeit gets passed, baby's first convention security.

1267
00:58:25,819 --> 00:58:30,640
Rym: >> But the west coast has real security teams.

1268
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:39,180
Rym: Like the people who do -- like the green shirts in the convention center, I want them to like come home and like just help me out with stuff because they're like the best people ever.

1269
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:39,739
Rym: >> Yep.

1270
00:58:39,739 --> 00:58:43,500
Rym: >> They caught counterfeits to a degree that was amazing.

1271
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,480
Scott: >> They didn't catch all of them.

1272
00:58:44,603 --> 00:58:45,280
Scott: That's impossible.

1273
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,478
Scott: But they caught a significant number.

1274
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,039
Scott: A very significant number.

1275
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:59,520
Rym: >> Now, the thing is these counterfeits, the turnaround time on these things, I imagine, is pretty quick to the point that I feel like even if Pax did not mail out the badges, we'd have these things by Saturday.

1276
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,093
Rym: >> Yep.

1277
00:59:00,093 --> 00:59:03,459
Rym: >> So we're not going to talk about what's going to be done about this.

1278
00:59:03,702 --> 00:59:04,640
Rym: We've heard some things.

1279
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:05,458
Rym: We've talked to some people.

1280
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:08,468
Rym: But we're going to let Pax handle all that because it's not our game.

1281
00:59:08,468 --> 00:59:10,800
Scott: >> It's not our game, but I do have some suggestions.

1282
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:13,520
Scott: And a lot of people out there are making dumb suggestions.

1283
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,480
Scott: And all you people making dumb suggestions.

1284
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,758
Rym: >> First of all, all you people who said don't mail the badges, fuck you.

1285
00:59:18,758 --> 00:59:19,240
Scott: >> Shut the fuck up.

1286
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,157
Rym: >> Shut the fuck up.

1287
00:59:20,922 --> 00:59:21,092
Rym: No.

1288
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:22,760
Rym: We've been down that road.

1289
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:25,600
Rym: Otakon has 15,000 people line up Thursday night.

1290
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,659
Rym: That sucks.

1291
00:59:26,659 --> 00:59:27,260
Rym: >> Right.

1292
00:59:27,601 --> 00:59:30,788
Scott: So, you know, some people are just like, oh, slap a hologram on it.

1293
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,060
Scott: That's really not good enough.

1294
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:33,893
Scott: Some people like put a bar code on it.

1295
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:37,880
Scott: It's like, dude, bar code works at a baseball game because there's no reentry.

1296
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:43,220
Scott: They scan everything once and then you get in through a turnstile and you never leave.

1297
00:59:43,543 --> 00:59:45,060
Scott: That's why a bar code works.

1298
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:47,620
Rym: >> So bar code works in one situation.

1299
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:49,227
Rym: It works.

1300
00:59:49,268 --> 00:59:56,299
Rym: if they're not -- you see, everyone who says bar code or QR code or serial number seems to think that you're going to have people checking these as you go into the com.

1301
00:59:56,613 --> 00:59:56,658
Rym: No.

1302
00:59:56,658 --> 00:59:56,845
Rym: >> No.

1303
00:59:56,845 --> 01:00:02,100
Rym: >> The way you use that is you tie your name to a badge.

1304
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,540
Rym: So when you buy a badge, your name is tied to that bar code.

1305
01:00:07,101 --> 01:00:08,998
Rym: And the badge, you can hit a thing and it's legit.

1306
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:14,460
Rym: So maybe if you sell your badge to someone, you transfer the ownership on the PAC's website.

1307
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:22,259
Rym: But there's no way to see who owns a badge unless you scan the bar code and you make it in such a way that it can't just be scanned by someone walking by.

1308
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:23,458
Rym: You're like, here, check it out.

1309
01:00:23,902 --> 01:00:24,798
Rym: Like scan my badge.

1310
01:00:25,964 --> 01:00:30,499
Rym: One, you know, I'm sure they could make some deal where like booths scan badges and have raffles or whatever.

1311
01:00:31,101 --> 01:00:43,537
Rym: Two, you make an iPhone app and an Android app and if someone's scalping a badge, you scan it and you'd be like, all right, Joey Jojo Shabadoo, the website says that you don't own a badge, so what's this shit you're trying to sell me?

1312
01:00:43,537 --> 01:00:47,399
Scott: >> Yeah, or the website says this badge belongs to so and so.

1313
01:00:47,399 --> 01:00:48,479
Rym: >> But that's not your name.

1314
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:49,518
Scott: >> What's your name?

1315
01:00:49,518 --> 01:00:49,956
Scott: >> Huh.

1316
01:00:49,956 --> 01:00:50,496
Scott: >> Huh.

1317
01:00:50,496 --> 01:00:55,620
Rym: >> Of course, the easy way to tell the counterfeit is to grab someone's badge and rip it in two down the bottom.

1318
01:00:56,107 --> 01:00:56,700
Rym: They weren't plastic.

1319
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,120
Rym: They were just cardboard with laminate.

1320
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:58,739
Rym: >> Yeah.

1321
01:00:58,739 --> 01:00:59,840
Rym: >> They just tore right in half.

1322
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:06,678
Scott: >> But really what it comes down to is, you know, obviously people who buy counterfeit badges are victims, right?

1323
01:01:06,801 --> 01:01:10,198
Scott: They didn't know they were buying counterfeit badges, especially when it's such a convincing badge.

1324
01:01:10,921 --> 01:01:15,815
Scott: But at the same time, you know, we need to -- we can't -- there's no way to stop counterfeiters altogether.

1325
01:01:15,815 --> 01:01:16,779
Rym: >> Let's put it this way.

1326
01:01:16,779 --> 01:01:17,960
Rym: >> The only thing you can do --.

1327
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,730
Rym: >> If I bought -- this is the example you were using at the con.

1328
01:01:20,222 --> 01:01:26,876
Rym: If I bought a counterfeit ticket to a Red Wings game and I show up at the stadium, they're not letting me in.

1329
01:01:26,876 --> 01:01:28,520
Scott: >> I'm lucky they don't arrest me.

1330
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:29,179
Scott: >> That's right.

1331
01:01:29,941 --> 01:01:37,719
Scott: So we nearly need to be like, look, people, if you're buying a badge from an unlegitimate source, it's up to you to verify if it's real or not.

1332
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:47,196
Scott: And if you fail at that, well, you know, and that's the only way to prevent counterfeiting is to get the people who are buying the badges to be really, you know --.

1333
01:01:47,196 --> 01:01:49,076
Rym: >> Now, here's another thing I might do.

1334
01:01:49,076 --> 01:01:49,679
Rym: >> Sketchical.

1335
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:55,840
Rym: >> Let's say -- because, you know, PAX's policy, I don't officially know what it is, and I'm not going to talk about what they may or may not have done.

1336
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:59,960
Rym: Suppose that they took people who got counterfeit badges and made some sort of deal.

1337
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:01,680
Rym: Like, they gave them a real badge instead.

1338
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:02,158
Rym: >> You can't.

1339
01:02:02,382 --> 01:02:03,600
Scott: You already sold all your badges.

1340
01:02:03,842 --> 01:02:04,217
Scott: Fire marshal.

1341
01:02:04,217 --> 01:02:04,443
Scott: >> Ah.

1342
01:02:05,322 --> 01:02:06,019
Rym: So we can't do that.

1343
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:15,599
Rym: Let's say we have a deal with the fire marshal or whatever where we have X capacity for more badges, which one cuts down on people who can get into PAX.

1344
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:16,198
Rym: That sucks.

1345
01:02:16,198 --> 01:02:20,419
Rym: >> But at the same time, you use it where, all right, kid, you've got a counterfeit badge.

1346
01:02:21,463 --> 01:02:24,679
Rym: You can buy a real badge, but you got to pay full price right now.

1347
01:02:24,679 --> 01:02:33,100
Scott: >> Yeah, but then I'll just buy -- instead of it'll sell out, and then I'll just buy counterfeit and show up, and that way it won't matter that it's sold out.

1348
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:33,800
Scott: I get in anyway.

1349
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:34,194
Scott: That's --.

1350
01:02:34,194 --> 01:02:35,600
Rym: >> So there aren't good solutions.

1351
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:36,520
Rym: You see what I'm getting at here.

1352
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,513
Rym: There isn't really, like, every way to handle this.

1353
01:02:38,513 --> 01:02:40,712
Rym: >> Well, Scott, your solution is a little -- go on.

1354
01:02:40,712 --> 01:02:45,959
Scott: >> You should make the badge ridiculously awesome, perhaps even make it so awesome --.

1355
01:02:45,959 --> 01:02:48,399
Rym: >> Scott, make it like the magfest badges, the special ones.

1356
01:02:48,399 --> 01:02:50,680
Rym: >> Nope, the special magfest badges.

1357
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:53,939
Scott: >> No, but like Def Con badges with electronics in them.

1358
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:58,596
Scott: Make the badge so ludicrously advanced and expensive that the badge itself might be 30 bucks.

1359
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:00,178
Scott: Right?

1360
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:00,571
Scott: Like --.

1361
01:03:00,571 --> 01:03:02,300
Rym: >> And then raise the price -- here's the thing.

1362
01:03:02,803 --> 01:03:04,060
Rym: So it's got a USB port on it.

1363
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:10,380
Rym: Raise the price of the badge by and sell space on that USB in the badge to vendors.

1364
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:17,178
Scott: So you would -- both the badge would make money from people advertising in the badge, not on the badge, but in it.

1365
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:17,892
Scott: Right?

1366
01:03:18,521 --> 01:03:25,419
Scott: And simultaneously, you know, PAX should be a flat rate or maybe, you know, it should be still accessible to people in terms of price.

1367
01:03:25,821 --> 01:03:27,780
Scott: But really, you need to raise the price a little bit.

1368
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:28,500
Rym: >> A little bit, 10 bucks.

1369
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:33,148
Scott: >> Make it 65, 75 at the most for the PAX badge instead of 50.

1370
01:03:33,148 --> 01:03:33,400
Scott: Right?

1371
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:36,219
Rym: >> Yeah, because anime cons charge way more than you.

1372
01:03:36,219 --> 01:03:38,100
Scott: >> Also, only sell weekend badges.

1373
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:46,899
Rym: >> Yeah, forget -- there's no reason to have single-day badges because I posit to you, almost anyone who buys a single-day badge has bought two or three of.

1374
01:03:46,899 --> 01:03:51,560
Scott: >> I mean, it's like you want PAX to be inclusive, you know, to make it as accessible as possible.

1375
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,500
Scott: There are people who can only make it for one day.

1376
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:58,520
Scott: There are people who don't have enough money for the three-day they want to -- you know, but if they can go for one day, that'll.

1377
01:03:58,520 --> 01:03:59,600
Scott: >> But nobody does that.

1378
01:04:00,262 --> 01:04:04,340
Rym: Everyone who buys a Friday and a Sunday badge did so because they were out of three-day and Saturday badges.

1379
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:20,134
Scott: >> There are a lot of people who just buy one, two, three, and also, while I agree it should be accessible to -- you know, and inclusive, there's also the fact that, you know, some people are just more dedicated to PAX, and a dedicated person to PAX is going to go all three

1380
01:04:20,216 --> 01:04:20,560
Rym: days.

1381
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:21,640
Rym: >> Yep, if you really want it.

1382
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:28,979
Scott: >> The only sad thing is that somebody might buy a weekend pass and not use all three days, and then someone else might be denied a day that was available.

1383
01:04:28,979 --> 01:04:32,078
Rym: >> Ah, but if you're not using all three days, sell your badge to someone as you're leaving.

1384
01:04:32,078 --> 01:04:33,160
Scott: >> That's a good idea.

1385
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:33,389
Rym: >> Yeah.

1386
01:04:33,389 --> 01:04:34,720
Rym: >> Anyway.

1387
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,159
Rym: >> So imagine this.

1388
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:36,740
Rym: You get your badge.

1389
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:38,996
Rym: It's kind of thick and cool and light.

1390
01:04:39,381 --> 01:04:42,380
Rym: It's got a USB thing on it, and you know, like I was looking at this for GeekNights.

1391
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:48,999
Rym: It's pretty cheap to in bulk buy tiny MP3 players with preloaded content, like tens of thousands of them.

1392
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:50,220
Rym: Like it's surprisingly cheap.

1393
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:56,940
Scott: >> Yeah, there's a lot of fancy electronic things, LEDs, RFIDs, full hologram, not a tiny hologram sticker.

1394
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:57,459
Scott: >> But imagine this.

1395
01:04:57,521 --> 01:04:58,780
Rym: You get your badge in the mail, right?

1396
01:04:58,920 --> 01:04:59,437
Rym: What's on it?

1397
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,709
Rym: >> An unreleased episode of PATV.

1398
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,979
Rym: All the demos to games that the publishers paid to put on them.

1399
01:05:05,979 --> 01:05:06,571
Scott: >> Some --.

1400
01:05:06,571 --> 01:05:07,760
Rym: >> A League of Legends item.

1401
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:08,247
Rym: >> Yep.

1402
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,979
Scott: All that kind of crap can be on that USB stick when your badge comes in the mail.

1403
01:05:11,979 --> 01:05:17,360
Rym: >> Maybe a game that is part of some sort of like packs, like -- like -- I don't know.

1404
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:22,960
Scott: >> Yeah, maybe you can put badges together and then do some sort of thing with them or get them scanned at different locations.

1405
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:28,860
Scott: You know, and then what you do, right, is you don't have any particular badge checking spot, right?

1406
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:34,000
Scott: You don't have like everyone here has to check badges and then there's a big clusterfuck of traffic.

1407
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:37,237
Rym: What you do is -- already do at the entrances, they do.

1408
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:37,940
Rym: That works fine.

1409
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:40,960
Scott: >> Right, but what you do is, for example, there's a bunch of people waiting for a panel.

1410
01:05:41,182 --> 01:05:41,720
Scott: They're just sitting.

1411
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:46,091
Scott: So you have an enforcer just casually walk down the line like just, hey, can I see everyone's badge?

1412
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,198
Scott: Everyone hold your badge up.

1413
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:52,080
Scott: And maybe he goes beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, just down the line of people who are waiting for the panel.

1414
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,819
Scott: There's already people waiting there anyway.

1415
01:05:54,103 --> 01:05:55,220
Scott: They're already not moving.

1416
01:05:55,601 --> 01:05:58,509
Scott: The enforcer is already just sitting there waiting to open the door, right?

1417
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,260
Scott: There's usually two or three of them at a panel door, right?

1418
01:06:01,781 --> 01:06:10,900
Scott: Any place like that in the convention, you know, a line to play a game, you know, any line or any waiting area, you know, people are waiting in line for the omegathon finale or the keynote.

1419
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:12,532
Scott: Just have one enforcer go down the line.

1420
01:06:12,532 --> 01:06:16,878
Rym: >> If you just did that, that kind of sucks because that's like visible security or whatever.

1421
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:18,760
Rym: You know, it's not a good thing for the vibe of the con.

1422
01:06:19,364 --> 01:06:25,076
Rym: So what you do is because we've got these serial numbers, every time you do that, you do a mini raffle right there for some tiny thing.

1423
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:25,784
Scott: It's also --.

1424
01:06:25,784 --> 01:06:34,160
Scott: >> It's a combination security check in the guise of not just a raffle but also a check-in, right?

1425
01:06:34,241 --> 01:06:46,937
Scott: So you can go log into the pack site and see all the things you did and also Penny Arcade will have data about who checked in where for what events to see where the traffic is flowing, what's more popular, what's less popular, you know, what people like.

1426
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,900
Scott: That's very valuable information that most conventions don't have.

1427
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:54,659
Scott: There's so many benefits, you know, and of course, beep, beep, beep.

1428
01:06:54,659 --> 01:06:56,420
Scott: >> Dude, your badge ain't real.

1429
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,057
Scott: Yeah, come with me.

1430
01:06:59,220 --> 01:06:59,331
Scott: Right?

1431
01:06:59,331 --> 01:06:59,816
Rym: >> Yep.

1432
01:06:59,816 --> 01:07:02,187
Scott: >> So that's what they need to do.

1433
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:13,718
Scott: Make a fancy badge, get the money for it by increasing the con price and also selling badge stuff and then check it in places where people aren't doing anything and it wouldn't hurt to check.

1434
01:07:13,718 --> 01:07:18,080
Rym: >> I mean, beyond that, we played a lot of goddamn games, PAX was awesome.

1435
01:07:18,943 --> 01:07:20,978
Rym: I think I played more games at this PAX than any other PAX.

1436
01:07:20,978 --> 01:07:24,120
Scott: >> Yeah, but I didn't play a lot of games I never played before.

1437
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:27,640
Rym: >> Which is fine because half the reason I go is to play new games like Marrakesh.

1438
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,518
Scott: >> Yeah, this PAX --.

1439
01:07:28,518 --> 01:07:30,289
Rym: >> And half the reason I go is to play games.

1440
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:31,839
Rym: I've already going to buy that shit.

1441
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:32,580
Rym: >> I'm going to buy that shit.

1442
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:32,977
Rym: Fuck you.

1443
01:07:32,977 --> 01:07:40,719
Rym: >> Is that I like to play games I know with people who also know those games who I normally don't get to play them with or I don't get to play these games that often.

1444
01:07:40,719 --> 01:07:42,799
Scott: >> There's definitely -- that was the most of this PAX.

1445
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:48,595
Scott: Next PAX, though, I hope to do more of the games I never played before with maybe people I don't know.

1446
01:07:48,595 --> 01:07:55,138
Rym: >> Yeah, and sorry, magfest dudes, I actually kept like not having time to stop into your jam space and say hi.

1447
01:07:55,138 --> 01:07:57,040
Scott: >> Yeah, but now I have a mission, though.

1448
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:57,849
Scott: I learned something.

1449
01:07:57,869 --> 01:08:02,499
Scott: this PAX is that, you know, I've sort of been experiencing the same part of PAX over and over again.

1450
01:08:03,184 --> 01:08:06,418
Scott: I think in the long run -- I'm going to go to tons and tons of PAXes, right?

1451
01:08:07,362 --> 01:08:10,019
Scott: I think I want to do every aspect of PAX.

1452
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:12,360
Scott: So I think I'm going to be an enforcer once at least.

1453
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,611
Scott: I think I'm going to try to be an omega naught once at least, right?

1454
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,340
Scott: I'm going to try to do everything eventually.

1455
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:21,019
Rym: >> I would go for omega naught at least, I think, because I kind of dig the co-op-y games.

1456
01:08:21,019 --> 01:08:23,078
Scott: >> Maybe I'll be X-ball Haul once, you know?

1457
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:27,697
Scott: I'm going to try to do everything at PAX once in all the years of PAXes.

1458
01:08:28,481 --> 01:08:29,439
Scott: So we'll see.

1459
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:29,916
Rym: >> Yep.

1460
01:08:31,742 --> 01:08:33,997
Rym: And on that note, we will see you at PAX.

1461
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:35,160
Rym: It's not that far away.

1462
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:35,840
Rym: >> Nope.

1463
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:44,129
Rym: >> This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1464
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:49,247
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1465
01:08:49,247 --> 01:08:54,609
Scott: >> Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1466
01:08:54,609 --> 01:08:57,609
Rym: >> Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1467
01:08:57,870 --> 01:09:02,268
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1468
01:09:02,268 --> 01:09:05,881

1469
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:10,129
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1470
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:13,290
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
