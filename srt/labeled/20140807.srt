00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,284
Scott: It's not a thing of the day.

7
00:00:30,444 --> 00:00:34,320
Scott: That's the thing of the day of the decades before you're born a game of tennis.

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:41,477
Rym: Ah The thing is that skit is funny even if you don't get what it's actually making fun of.

00:00:46,975 --> 00:00:48,200
Scott: It's a familiar word.

12
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,489
Rym: Really, how is that a familiar word in what context?

13
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,538
Rym: give me any relation to that word?

14
00:00:54,618 --> 00:00:56,624
Scott: It's a word I've heard before.

15
00:00:57,045 --> 00:00:57,446
Rym: where?

16
00:00:57,466 --> 00:00:58,248
Rym: how?

17
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:59,912
Scott: it's just the word.

18
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:00,233
Rym: is it?

19
00:01:00,253 --> 00:01:03,579
Rym: it is not a new word to me It's a name.

20
00:01:04,301 --> 00:01:06,880
Rym: Okay, you have never heard that word, but I've heard it.

21
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,400
Scott: I don't know what it means or I don't think I've heard it, but I have heard it.

22
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:12,329
Rym: I don't think you've heard of Sam peckinpah.

23
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,515
Scott: I have heard that name.

24
00:01:13,576 --> 00:01:14,480
Scott: I don't know Sam peckinpah.

25
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,744
Scott: I've heard the fur the word.

26
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:20,080
Rym: no one would ever say peckinpah unless they were referencing Sam peckinpah.

27
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,745
Scott: I have heard it in my life.

28
00:01:22,246 --> 00:01:24,352
Rym: Uh-huh so can you guess why?

29
00:01:24,372 --> 00:01:25,696
Rym: it's related to salad days.

30
00:01:26,037 --> 00:01:27,080
Scott: He was a dude like that?

31
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,626
Rym: Oh Like what he?

32
00:01:29,686 --> 00:01:34,143
Scott: maybe he was a crazy killer who went to guys playing tennis and murdered them by cutting No one's off.

33
00:01:34,484 --> 00:01:36,271
Rym: No one murdered anyone in salad days.

34
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,379
Rym: That was just a series of horrific accidents.

35
00:01:39,563 --> 00:01:42,641
Scott: Maybe he was just really accident-prone, dude Quotes.

36
00:01:43,202 --> 00:01:57,040
Rym: dad David Samuel Sam peckinpah February 21st 1925 to December 28th 1984 was an American film director and screenwriter who achieved prominence following the release of the Western epic the wild bunch.

37
00:01:57,582 --> 00:01:58,325
Scott: No, I know them.

38
00:01:58,446 --> 00:02:01,680
Rym: I heard of that movie blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

39
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:06,220
Rym: He was given the nickname bloody Sam owing to the violence in his films.

40
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:14,380
Rym: His characters are often loners or losers who desire to be honorable But are forced to compromise in order to survive in a world of nihilism and brutality.

41
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:16,386
Scott: I should go see that movie.

42
00:02:16,587 --> 00:02:21,000
Rym: didn't you notice in the salad days sketch that they're like directed by Sam peckinpah?

43
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,025
Rym: No, that's the joke.

44
00:02:23,588 --> 00:02:25,655
Rym: It's not just the horrific accident.

45
00:02:25,716 --> 00:02:29,602
Rym: violence, okay Learn something new every day.

46
00:02:29,622 --> 00:02:30,924
Scott: There you go every day.

47
00:02:31,505 --> 00:02:31,785
Scott: Sure.

48
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:33,888
Rym: So, uh got some news here.

49
00:02:33,908 --> 00:02:41,174
Rym: I'm kind of Shocked and amazed that regular media was really not covering this at all.

50
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:46,291
Rym: And I'm not talking about in that sense of Republicans and Fox News being like but Benghazi.

51
00:02:46,572 --> 00:02:48,138
Rym: why doesn't anyone care about Benghazi?

52
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,600
Rym: Yeah Talking about actual news is you don't care about Benghazi?

53
00:02:52,002 --> 00:03:01,080
Rym: So the American media has been going crazy about Ebola But they're not going crazy about it in terms of the humanitarian crisis in the countries where it is occurring.

54
00:03:01,763 --> 00:03:04,616
Rym: They're going crazy about it in the sense of oh my god.

55
00:03:04,656 --> 00:03:05,419
Rym: What if it comes here?

56
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,659
Rym: Of course, but what they're not talking about is what happened in Toledo the other day.

57
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:12,387
Rym: Okay, you know what happened in Toledo.

58
00:03:12,688 --> 00:03:15,800
Scott: I really couldn't give any fewer shits.

59
00:03:16,921 --> 00:03:23,424
Scott: Well, you wouldn't give any shit about anything that ever happens in Toledo, Ohio Unless for some reason.

60
00:03:23,444 --> 00:03:29,236
Scott: Toledo, Ohio decided to clear war in New York or something in which case I would sign up and shoot them in the face.

61
00:03:30,282 --> 00:03:33,860
Scott: But other than that, I don't care if a new kid Toledo, Ohio.

62
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:35,223
Scott: Well, I still wouldn't care.

63
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:37,329
Rym: you are familiar with the Toledo war right.

64
00:03:37,369 --> 00:03:43,300
Rym: that was between Michigan and Ohio Over the rights to the Toledo disputed.

65
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:48,480
Scott: That's why the only thing I'm concerned with is maybe they might start that shit up again only pointed in the wrong direction.

66
00:03:48,942 --> 00:03:50,267
Scott: They're pretty far away.

67
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:53,320
Rym: wait, so you're saying in the war between Ohio and Michigan you're on Michigan side.

68
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:58,780
Scott: No, I'm saying if they decided to you know, take the warlike ways to New York, I don't give a shit.

69
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,752
Rym: How would they even get here?

70
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:02,429
Scott: Listen, they have cars.

71
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,398
Scott: All right, it's modern times.

72
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,119
Scott: They're more cars than we have because we don't drive.

73
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:12,000
Rym: I look this war is great because belligerent state of Ohio territory of Michigan casualties and losses.

74
00:04:12,443 --> 00:04:17,610
Rym: Ohio lost nobody and Michigan had zero dead and one wounded.

75
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,136
Rym: I think like 14 shots were fired.

76
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,870
Scott: I'll tell you they start that shit up with New York.

77
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:23,240
Scott: Those numbers gonna be a lot higher.

78
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:27,400
Rym: I'm gonna go volunteer gonna sign up to be one of the dough boys.

79
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:33,803
Scott: It will not be good for you people from the state with two O's in the name heading over on the Erie Canal to do Some some battling.

80
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:36,631
Rym: Yeah now so what happened in Toledo?

81
00:04:37,172 --> 00:04:39,719
Rym: because a lot of people don't seem to realize that anything happened.

82
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:45,585
Rym: There was some news about a water crisis And that's most of what people heard.

83
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:49,540
Scott: what actually happened was something usually that shits out in California, Arizona.

84
00:04:49,763 --> 00:04:54,207
Scott: Yes run out of water So they have water there.

85
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,960
Scott: It's not a no water place like Arizona so you can read the details about it.

86
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:07,490
Rym: but the irony of the fact that this occurred in a city that borders the Great Lakes it Really tells you how much of an actual crisis this was.

87
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,880
Scott: how couldn't they just start drinking a Great Lake water?

88
00:05:11,343 --> 00:05:11,948
Rym: Yes, it's got.

89
00:05:11,989 --> 00:05:13,280
Rym: they do drink Great Lakes water.

90
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,600
Rym: Here's what happened to Lido and the entire metropolitan region around it, which is about a half a million.

91
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,268
Scott: This did not affect Cleveland Columbus.

92
00:05:20,308 --> 00:05:20,770
Scott: It's now.

93
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:28,760
Rym: it affected Toledo in a surrounding so about 500,000 people give or take were affected so almost Nova up on the grand scale of the country.

94
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,206
Rym: That's bigger than a lot of places.

95
00:05:31,226 --> 00:05:34,696
Scott: It's less than it's always like my neighborhood's worth.

96
00:05:34,997 --> 00:05:35,879
Rym: It's more than Seattle.

97
00:05:39,532 --> 00:05:42,082
Rym: So Toledo Declared.

98
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:52,000
Rym: they announced that there was an emergency and that nobody should drink the water Touch the water brush their teeth with the water cook with the water bathe with the water.

99
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,495
Scott: How could the whole Great Lake be poisoned?

100
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:55,280
Scott: That's impossible.

101
00:05:55,662 --> 00:05:58,680
Scott: Now the sheer amount of poison is impossible.

102
00:05:58,961 --> 00:06:03,719
Rym: Actually, it's very easy for that to happen and it was just the area around the reservoir intake thingy.

103
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,493
Rym: So the reservoir intake thingy is massive and it's out in the middle of Lake Erie.

104
00:06:07,673 --> 00:06:13,500
Rym: obviously Lake Erie Has been having for a long time now algal blooms.

105
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:15,828
Scott: So you did algae in the water?

106
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:18,159
Scott: Yes, doesn't the water treatment center clean that shit out?

107
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,060
Rym: Uh, it's supposed to but one because we don't have the water treatment center because we don't invest in civil infrastructure.

108
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,252
Rym: Toledo's water treatment system kind of old kind of shitty.

109
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:30,420
Rym: so it broke and the intakes are near to the surface.

110
00:06:30,762 --> 00:06:37,816
Rym: No, what happened was the algae had a huge bloom More so than has happened in recent memory at least since they started testing clogged.

111
00:06:37,876 --> 00:06:38,780
Scott: it clogged the shit up.

112
00:06:39,061 --> 00:06:44,560
Rym: No, so this toxin was just created in such quantity that it could not be removed from the water.

113
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,939
Rym: It also is very difficult to test for this toxin.

114
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:48,582
Scott: What do you mean?

115
00:06:48,602 --> 00:06:49,906
Scott: you drink the water if you die?

116
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:53,900
Rym: No, this toxin causes cumulative liver damage from what I can gather.

117
00:06:54,382 --> 00:06:55,268
Scott: Oh, it's not like.

118
00:06:55,308 --> 00:06:57,300
Rym: you're not from drinking it from being exposed to it.

119
00:06:58,381 --> 00:07:00,660
Rym: People who have had liver problems.

120
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,699
Rym: It's really lakes hepatitis from being near lakes that were also near farms or pig farms.

121
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:13,678
Rym: Because what happens is fertilizer runoff and phosphates get into the water in like ponds algae go.

122
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:15,969
Rym: Oh fuck There's more food here than we've ever had.

123
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:17,236
Rym: So algae explodes everywhere.

124
00:07:17,256 --> 00:07:20,589
Rym: Just algae everywhere Yeah, and then the algae makes poison.

125
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:23,880
Scott: can't they just go out into the lake and spray all the algaes to kill them off?

126
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:28,079
Scott: Yes by putting poison in the water sure, but there are people from Ohio so we don't care.

127
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:29,966
Rym: So there's already poison in the water.

128
00:07:30,347 --> 00:07:32,574
Rym: the the result of this can't make it worse.

129
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:42,713
Rym: usually when there's a water Emergency like that in the civilized modern industrialized world I mean there aren't and daughters make can't do something at the water treatment facility.

130
00:07:42,773 --> 00:07:44,399
Scott: insert some new equipment that takes care of.

131
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:49,385
Rym: that would Take probably years to put in place Money even then.

132
00:07:49,405 --> 00:07:50,770
Scott: Oh, all right, Ohio doesn't have any.

133
00:07:51,091 --> 00:08:07,071
Rym: also the problem is that Lake Erie being shallow being Warmer due to global warming and he's pretty happy right and being increasingly flooded with fertilizer runoff due to largely Unregulated farms and golf courses of living in farm places.

134
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:07,292
Scott: Yeah.

135
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,821
Rym: Yeah, but places that could regulate and choose not to Mm-hmm.

136
00:08:11,363 --> 00:08:16,020
Rym: It's basically a perfect storm of everything conservatives believe don't happen or matter.

137
00:08:16,743 --> 00:08:18,613
Rym: Actually poison the water supply of a city.

138
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:22,066
Rym: for three days The water was toxic and unusable.

139
00:08:22,427 --> 00:08:27,440
Rym: the National Guard had to be mobilized water had to be trucked in every store ran out of water.

140
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:30,579
Rym: It was a disaster and people likely would have died.

141
00:08:31,841 --> 00:08:40,138
Rym: They suddenly declared after a few days that the poison levels had dropped below the line And thus it was okay to drink the water again.

142
00:08:41,662 --> 00:08:42,707
Rym: This is far from over.

143
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,619
Rym: this could happen again at any point.

144
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,860
Scott: now I'm much more concerned of Ohio declaring war in New York to take our treasured water supply.

145
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,886
Rym: Why would they not declare war on Michigan?

146
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:56,619
Rym: because Ohio has one great lake the shittiest great lake.

147
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,352
Scott: granted It's not even that great.

148
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,139
Scott: It's just the good way.

149
00:08:59,481 --> 00:09:01,047
Rym: The thing is it's the great lake.

150
00:09:01,228 --> 00:09:03,939
Rym: Lake Erie is still better than any other fucking lake in the world.

151
00:09:06,782 --> 00:09:07,805
Rym: What Lake Champlain.

152
00:09:07,986 --> 00:09:09,973
Rym: Lake Champlain is like a hundredth the size of like.

153
00:09:09,993 --> 00:09:11,980
Scott: I'm thinking of lakes like on the other side of the planet.

154
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,873
Scott: There aren't that many lakes that big and those are the ones I thought of ours actually sees.

155
00:09:16,153 --> 00:09:19,404
Rym: so Ohio is on the smallest and Shittiest of the Great Lakes.

156
00:09:19,464 --> 00:09:29,740
Rym: Michigan has access to Lake Superior, which is pretty fucking awesome in terms of water to drink Mmm, and you know the other great lakes up there like Lake Superior, but that's clearly yeah.

157
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,108
Rym: It's also deep and fucking cold the middle of summer.

158
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:36,116
Rym: go there like August 30th on a sunny hundred degree day.

159
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:41,079
Scott: That water is 32.1 degrees thing is you're so proud of these fucking lakes.

160
00:09:41,862 --> 00:09:44,631
Scott: Any none of these lakes even hold a candle to a sea.

161
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:50,107
Rym: a sea is just unbeatable unless you want to drink the water Black Sea Red Sea Mediterranean Sea.

162
00:09:50,247 --> 00:09:52,132
Rym: Yeah, don't drink any of those.

163
00:09:52,714 --> 00:09:53,877
Rym: go drink some of the Dead Sea.

164
00:09:54,118 --> 00:09:54,900
Rym: What's it called again?

165
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:55,704
Rym: Oh, right.

166
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:57,055
Scott: You don't drink it you floating in.

167
00:09:57,076 --> 00:09:59,667
Rym: it's a The point of this news.

168
00:09:59,728 --> 00:10:01,598
Rym: I'm not gonna go do the play-by-play.

169
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:03,025
Rym: Read about it.

170
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:03,990
Rym: go read what happened.

171
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,940
Rym: the news didn't cover it at all outside of that area.

172
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:15,440
Rym: But think about for a second what just happened in the United States of America one of the most Industrialized and advanced countries in the world one of the safest water supplies in the world.

173
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,005
Scott: Well depending on which state you're in.

174
00:10:17,226 --> 00:10:21,280
Rym: but even the shittiest states have better water here than most of the rest of the world.

175
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:22,949
Scott: Yeah, where there's dysentery and shit.

176
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:23,311
Rym: Yes.

177
00:10:23,653 --> 00:10:28,920
Rym: I mean when I go to India I have to drink bottled water even in like major cities in luxury hotels.

178
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:30,105
Rym: That's fucked up.

179
00:10:30,205 --> 00:10:32,817
Scott: actual luxury hotels not hotels that just use the word luxury.

180
00:10:32,938 --> 00:10:33,480
Scott: exactly.

181
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:42,699
Rym: Yeah, but in America in a normal city, I mean Toledo is not the smallest city It's actually on the scale of cities in the country one of the bigger cities.

182
00:10:43,563 --> 00:10:56,710
Rym: The entire water supply was poisoned and we could do nothing about it But for the fact that the algae just happened to recede enough to where the toxin levels drop just low enough where we'd say it's Okay to drink is the only reason the people are done.

183
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:57,793
Scott: It's just not as much poison.

184
00:10:58,034 --> 00:11:04,360
Rym: had they had this not subsided It's not out of the realm but a staged evacuation of the city would have had to occur.

185
00:11:04,742 --> 00:11:09,285
Scott: No, I mean, there's probably enough water for like a few people to say that Yeah, but I mean they were trucking it.

186
00:11:09,325 --> 00:11:13,800
Rym: They emptied pretty much every source of bottled water within the region.

187
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,676
Scott: Couldn't they just seal the intake and then make a big pipe to somewhere else from where?

188
00:11:18,736 --> 00:11:19,820
Rym: how long do you think that would take?

189
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,454
Rym: This shit is not fast to do.

190
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:23,544
Scott: Make a pipe we have.

191
00:11:23,645 --> 00:11:26,800
Rym: how many decades did it take Scott to make a new pipe to New York?

192
00:11:27,242 --> 00:11:29,279
Rym: Even when we spent a lot of money, it's not easy.

193
00:11:29,882 --> 00:11:32,489
Scott: Well, I mean if you put the pipe above ground said underground you have to

194
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:44,999
Rym: just consider the fact that this happened in the year 2014 in a city in the United States of America and the news gave zero fucks about it Despite the fact that this is an unresolved issue.

195
00:11:46,585 --> 00:11:47,327
Rym: This is fucked.

196
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:48,170
Rym: Mmm.

197
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:49,714
Rym: Anyway, that's my news.

198
00:11:50,156 --> 00:12:01,006
Scott: You got something less depressing Yeah, so tomorrow we are going to go see Angry video game nerd movie.

199
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:02,611
Scott: Oh, yeah in New York City.

200
00:12:02,631 --> 00:12:05,060
Scott: I mean, it's already been screened a bunch of places.

201
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:13,020
Scott: I think it's being screened at PAX amongst other locations Yeah, but I don't want to spend packs hours my New York hours, but we're gonna go see it tomorrow.

202
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,406
Scott: He's finally finished it right?

203
00:12:15,446 --> 00:12:16,972
Scott: He didn't shit talk good on him.

204
00:12:16,992 --> 00:12:18,296
Scott: We'll let you know how.

205
00:12:18,357 --> 00:12:30,619
Scott: it is Kind of somewhat exciting not because I think it's gonna be the greatest movie ever, but it could be good but because It's like there's this dude who've been watching all this time.

206
00:12:31,221 --> 00:12:35,072
Rym: Someone on that level like made a thing that's big enough to be screened at Lincoln Center.

207
00:12:35,092 --> 00:12:37,660
Scott: Yeah, well Lincoln Center ish area, right?

208
00:12:39,404 --> 00:12:40,859
Scott: You know, how come we haven't done anything?

209
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,137
Scott: You know higher than our level because he is attacked only one.

210
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:45,539
Rym: we have it.

211
00:12:45,861 --> 00:12:48,240
Rym: We have like half as it Lee attacked like a hundred things.

212
00:12:49,181 --> 00:12:51,150
Rym: So true, we're slowly stepping up the game.

213
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,440
Scott: Why don't we quit everything then and just attack only one?

214
00:12:53,721 --> 00:12:54,403
Rym: I've thought about that.

215
00:12:54,423 --> 00:13:01,972
Rym: remember with the savings we've got now you me and Emily could move to like the equivalent of beacon and live For like two years with no income.

216
00:13:02,153 --> 00:13:05,879
Scott: I was thinking the other day I read this article about what it takes to win this field this yarn.

217
00:13:06,261 --> 00:13:07,065
Scott: I was like, you know what?

218
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:10,200
Scott: I just quit my job and just make games in forever until I win.

219
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,390
Rym: I'm bringing my prototype game to packs to play.

220
00:13:12,651 --> 00:13:13,736
Scott: Yeah, but you're not gonna win this field.

221
00:13:13,756 --> 00:13:17,071
Scott: this now It's like I should just concentrate on doing like.

222
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:20,616
Scott: I should pick one thing like that If not that and just do that and only that.

223
00:13:20,636 --> 00:13:22,348
Scott: yeah I get it my my.

224
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:29,820
Rym: that like my longest term goal I have in my world is someday I want to be important enough in the games industry to give the a keynote at apex.

225
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:39,054
Scott: Imagine if I want to spiel this yard, like I go Germany and they give me the little red Scott Reuben on it has the red pond on it.

226
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:42,448
Rym: if I won one I would tattoo that trophy on my body.

227
00:13:42,508 --> 00:13:44,395
Scott: someone I would do that, but it's like I could.

228
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:45,940
Scott: just I could die with no regret.

229
00:13:49,222 --> 00:13:50,369
Scott: It's like oh, all right, I'm good.

230
00:13:51,093 --> 00:13:52,521
Rym: Oh and there's a side news I know.

231
00:13:52,561 --> 00:13:53,324
Scott: think about this right.

232
00:13:53,545 --> 00:14:00,932
Scott: the Dominion dude Donald back arena, whatever motherfuckers got to Yeah, Dominion and then Kingdom builders one also, right?

233
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:02,117
Rym: Oh did it?

234
00:14:02,178 --> 00:14:05,308
Rym: Yeah, I think it did Yeah, so I got a little funny news to that.

235
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:28,351
Rym: This is this is one of those stories that may be apocryphal and Gawker linked to it and a FARC and I found this whole tree and as far as I can tell the nearest source I can Get is a single post on reddit, but supposedly guy was in line at a Burger King and Behind him was the shitty little kid who's having a tantrum about how he wants some fucking pie And he's really mad.

236
00:14:28,372 --> 00:14:30,379
Rym: his mom's like fine I'll buy you some pie.

237
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:35,232
Rym: So he being two people ahead of that family asked how many pies they had.

238
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:36,074
Rym: It was only 23.

239
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:37,337
Rym: So we bought them all.

240
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,484
Rym: Okay, and that's it Mm-hmm.

241
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:57,939
Rym: I found that was funny and mostly I'm curious Whether or not this happened and I'm curious why all these different news sites today decided to like Cannibalize off of each other into this like ouroboros circle jerk and linked to this thing.

242
00:14:58,422 --> 00:15:01,939
Rym: Okay, it's like a circle where I think they all link to each other and there's no origin.

243
00:15:02,827 --> 00:15:17,300
Rym: maybe things of the day But when we were young during our salad days One thing that we did we fancied a game of Mario Tennis.

244
00:15:17,469 --> 00:15:19,625
Rym: Nah we were.

245
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:38,925
Rym: we were coming out of Wegmans after buying our groceries and Next to in like in the area of the lottery machine that one time I put five bucks into and I won like 40 bucks The only time I ever put money in that thing and next to it were the vending machines that had like vampire teeth blood Really shitty candy.

246
00:15:38,945 --> 00:15:39,467
Rym: Mmm.

247
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:42,880
Rym: and one day Scott notices something called homies.

248
00:15:43,163 --> 00:15:44,640
Rym: Go over and look a little action.

249
00:15:44,761 --> 00:15:52,437
Scott: Well, they're not action figures, but little figurines little little, you know Plastic dudes and they were like little thug dudes called homies and they had.

250
00:15:52,457 --> 00:15:53,220
Scott: they had a lot of character.

251
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:54,192
Scott: They're actually pretty funny.

252
00:15:54,212 --> 00:15:56,443
Scott: You're cool For 50 cents.

253
00:15:56,463 --> 00:15:57,306
Rym: They were pretty quality.

254
00:15:57,346 --> 00:16:05,273
Scott: So I used to actually get him at the burger place of the train and Bill Gray's had the best homie machine man.

255
00:16:05,554 --> 00:16:07,623
Rym: I remember a lot of weird late nights Like we'd.

256
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:13,940
Rym: it'd be like 930 and we're hungry and we're like, yeah Let's just go to Bill Gray's and no one else ever went with us.

257
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,442
Rym: It was just like.

258
00:16:14,482 --> 00:16:16,930
Scott: that place is never crowded, but I know huge.

259
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:17,732
Rym: It was huge.

260
00:16:18,054 --> 00:16:19,177
Rym: The food was mediocre.

261
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,020
Scott: It was okay food.

262
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,980
Rym: They didn't have air hockey, but they had that other hockey.

263
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,120
Scott: You could get a fried chicken sandwich there.

264
00:16:24,341 --> 00:16:25,284
Scott: That was slightly.

265
00:16:25,324 --> 00:16:29,197
Scott: that was better than you could get at a fast-food place and that wasn't widely available.

266
00:16:29,217 --> 00:16:35,469
Rym: in retrospect I can't figure out why we ever went there instead of J's The diner.

267
00:16:35,489 --> 00:16:37,924
Rym: Yeah Like why?

268
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,960
Rym: why was it when it was the two of us steak on French bread?

269
00:16:41,141 --> 00:16:42,587
Scott: Yeah, cuz I guess there's.

270
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:45,099
Scott: you know, I just sit with a weight, you know weight service and whatnot.

271
00:16:45,219 --> 00:16:46,062
Rym: true It was faster.

272
00:16:46,544 --> 00:16:47,046
Rym: give it that.

273
00:16:47,487 --> 00:16:50,940
Scott: the place I always wanted to go was that there was like there's a place called moonshine barbecue.

274
00:16:51,101 --> 00:16:54,280
Scott: Oh, yeah, that drive-thru barbecue is just a barbecue restaurant.

275
00:16:54,746 --> 00:17:01,840
Scott: But then they opened up mine She moonshine barbecue Express across the street from millennium and that you can get the best barbecue sandwich there.

276
00:17:02,102 --> 00:17:04,140
Scott: Yeah, but that didn't last very long.

277
00:17:04,241 --> 00:17:06,619
Scott: I think I was the only one who went there and then it was gone.

278
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,647
Rym: I remember what's that weird sandwich place in that weird.

279
00:17:08,688 --> 00:17:09,190
Rym: now whenever?

280
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,385
Scott: yeah, whenever I see a similar sandwich other elsewhere I get it.

281
00:17:12,848 --> 00:17:17,500
Rym: thing is if I went over there as much as I like that place I go to a meals and get one of those like chicken cordon bleu meals.

282
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,989
Scott: Why'd you go to the palace which is a?

283
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:20,859
Scott: we could literally walk completely different kinds of food.

284
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,166
Rym: The Bellas is a saw but meals is a chicken sandwich.

285
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:25,073
Rym: Yeah, but I digress.

286
00:17:25,113 --> 00:17:25,513
Rym: so we.

287
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:27,260
Rym: we kind of collected these homies.

288
00:17:27,982 --> 00:17:28,851
Scott: Yeah, I have a bunch of them.

289
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:29,659
Scott: I found them the other day.

290
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,980
Rym: Yeah I remember I kept the one that was the cop in the car is like a toad.

291
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,363
Rym: Oh, we had.

292
00:17:33,665 --> 00:17:37,546
Scott: we got some doubles right because you're buying these Randomly from a from a machine.

293
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:44,880
Rym: I basically I had like three of this one guy with a long face We're in like like a basketball shirt had bad luck and I had two of the cop.

294
00:17:45,221 --> 00:17:45,885
Scott: I got quite a few.

295
00:17:45,925 --> 00:17:48,279
Rym: I should bust him out got that girl with the weird hair a couple times, too.

296
00:17:49,321 --> 00:17:51,412
Rym: So, uh, here's the documentary vice documentary.

297
00:17:51,432 --> 00:17:55,076
Scott: when we these things were useful It wasn't just like we were collecting stupid figures in college.

298
00:17:55,096 --> 00:17:55,620
Scott: for no reason.

299
00:17:56,021 --> 00:17:58,832
Scott: We played a lot of cheap ass games that just kill dr.

300
00:17:58,872 --> 00:17:59,996
Scott: Lucky which ended up being killed.

301
00:18:00,136 --> 00:18:00,357
Rym: dr.

302
00:18:00,397 --> 00:18:00,719
Rym: Homie

303
00:18:00,739 --> 00:18:05,207
Scott: kill dr Homie cuz you need you got to supply your own pawns Yeah, so

304
00:18:05,896 --> 00:18:17,192
Rym: so yeah If you ever wanted to know what the story was with homies because they were actually way bigger than we realized at the time This is a documentary about the guy who was responsible for the homie Empire.

305
00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:19,680
Rym: Well, let me tell you this is fascinating.

306
00:18:20,424 --> 00:18:21,500
Rym: This is depressing.

307
00:18:22,482 --> 00:18:23,447
Rym: So fair warning.

308
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:31,057
Rym: if you watch this you're gonna see the most stereotypical Staten Island guy with his voice and I fuck this shit fucking mother fuck shit.

309
00:18:31,118 --> 00:18:34,665
Scott: Fuck and It's my homies.

310
00:18:35,206 --> 00:18:35,628
Rym: Oh my god.

311
00:18:35,688 --> 00:18:36,269
Rym: It's so sad.

312
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:37,613
Rym: 30 fucking dollars.

313
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:38,435
Rym: These are 12 bucks.

314
00:18:38,997 --> 00:18:39,358
Rym: My man.

315
00:18:39,378 --> 00:18:40,020
Rym: I'll see you later.

316
00:18:41,002 --> 00:18:45,000
Rym: That guy sounds like what a lifetime of misery and cigarettes does to the human soul.

317
00:18:45,941 --> 00:18:56,784
Scott: Okay, so there's a question I've had for a long time and I knew that it's probably I definitely had an answer that I could Find on the internet, but I just never actually went through the effort of finding the answer on the internet Until just now I did.

318
00:18:57,646 --> 00:19:02,120
Scott: the question was if you know see the giant ass crane building a skyscraper or something.

319
00:19:03,063 --> 00:19:04,320
Scott: How do they build that crane?

320
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,566
Scott: How do they get it up there?

321
00:19:05,586 --> 00:19:09,188
Rym: a lot of people's response to that question is duh And then they trail off.

322
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,970
Scott: is they can't really figure it out Of course, and you think oh another crane.

323
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,300
Scott: obviously use some small cranes to get started.

324
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:18,612
Scott: But here's a video on YouTube showing how a tower crane works.

325
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:19,476
Scott: I'm gonna spoil it.

326
00:19:19,696 --> 00:19:20,540
Scott: It's really fascinating.

327
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,900
Scott: So they build a small piece of the tower just by building with other cranes.

328
00:19:25,562 --> 00:19:32,446
Scott: then they put the little control, you know room and all that stuff on top right and It's a crane.

329
00:19:32,466 --> 00:19:36,952
Scott: It's just really short on This the tower that the crane is on.

330
00:19:37,555 --> 00:19:38,520
Scott: there's a hydraulic lift.

331
00:19:39,702 --> 00:19:44,220
Scott: The hydraulic lift basically lifts the crane up one sections worth.

332
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:53,260
Scott: Then the crane goes and uses the actual crane that is working to lift up a new section and it slides in.

333
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:55,707
Scott: Then people screw it, you know, they attach it.

334
00:19:56,569 --> 00:20:01,559
Scott: then the hydraulic lift lifts the crane itself up one more section And that's how it works.

335
00:20:03,441 --> 00:20:05,990
Scott: So this led to a more fascinating question.

336
00:20:06,612 --> 00:20:10,130
Scott: as soon as I saw this video I was like, aha I get it That's amazing incredible.

337
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:11,200
Scott: It's everything I expected.

338
00:20:12,046 --> 00:20:13,700
Scott: How do they take that fucking shit apart?

339
00:20:14,883 --> 00:20:24,847
Scott: You think they would just do the same thing in reverse But actually no, so here's a video also second thing of day Dismantling the world's largest tower crane.

340
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:25,188
Scott: I don't know.

341
00:20:25,248 --> 00:20:28,097
Rym: is that is that representative of how they take apart all cranes?

342
00:20:28,137 --> 00:20:29,040
Rym: or is that one special?

343
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,947
Scott: It's specifically tower cranes Not any other kind of crane.

344
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:35,875
Scott: There are many cranes that are not tower cranes.

345
00:20:36,076 --> 00:20:36,960
Scott: This is a tower crane.

346
00:20:37,722 --> 00:20:39,035
Scott: This is how they take that one apart.

347
00:20:39,136 --> 00:20:51,592
Rym: All right In the meta moment the book club book is the mechanical for Liebowitz, I'm hoping Scott will read it as I I actually Opened up yesterday to where I was bookmarked and then immediately closed.

348
00:20:51,612 --> 00:20:52,134
Scott: they went to bed.

349
00:20:52,154 --> 00:20:53,177
Scott: That's great.

350
00:20:53,257 --> 00:20:54,320
Scott: without reading any words.

351
00:20:55,144 --> 00:20:56,512
Rym: We got a bunch of videos on the internet.

352
00:20:56,593 --> 00:20:57,820
Rym: not gonna dwell on all that stuff.

353
00:20:58,081 --> 00:21:02,780
Rym: We were running a contest to win two four day badges to PAX Prime.

354
00:21:03,181 --> 00:21:08,820
Scott: Those other people have had at least one person has received their tickets in the mail already.

355
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,391
Rym: So the deadline is fast approaching.

356
00:21:10,431 --> 00:21:18,940
Scott: when Scott receives them I'll probably give like one grace day and then pick a winner randomly from amongst the people who have tweeted properly.

357
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,964
Rym: We'll link to the rules.

358
00:21:20,005 --> 00:21:23,520
Rym: But basically you have to tweet promotional stuff about us and gig nights.

359
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,458
Scott: Yes, at least one person is tweeted incorrectly neglecting the PAX hashtag.

360
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:29,844
Rym: Oh You got it.

361
00:21:29,864 --> 00:21:31,511
Rym: You better check and make sure it wasn't you.

362
00:21:31,571 --> 00:21:33,740
Scott: you can still tweet again and get it, right?

363
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,524
Scott: It doesn't matter.

364
00:21:34,545 --> 00:21:36,920
Rym: We're going to do a search to find all the correct entries.

365
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,272
Scott: Yes, some people actually tweeted but did not link to any GeekNights content.

366
00:21:41,673 --> 00:21:42,014
Scott: You're all.

367
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,599
Scott: your tweet will also not count.

368
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,060
Scott: Ah So make sure you tweeted correctly.

369
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:48,811
Scott: Otherwise, you know, I just even it.

370
00:21:48,952 --> 00:21:50,080
Scott: I know some of you people too.

371
00:21:50,161 --> 00:21:53,888
Scott: I feel bad missing your entry But I gotta do what I got to do.

372
00:21:53,908 --> 00:21:56,918
Scott: if I'll be fair follow the rules or else your entry doesn't count.

373
00:21:56,998 --> 00:21:59,046
Scott: more than one Entry isn't gonna count either.

374
00:21:59,066 --> 00:21:59,869
Scott: You're just gonna get one

375
00:22:00,351 --> 00:22:16,520
Rym: now granted if if packs Announced or at least told panel like panelists and presenters and speakers if they had a badge ready for them or not Then we wouldn't even bother buying badges and giving them away like this meaning two more people could have just bought batches.

376
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:18,709
Rym: Yep, but this is the world we live in.

377
00:22:18,749 --> 00:22:21,038
Rym: I'm not risking not going to a PAX.

378
00:22:21,118 --> 00:22:21,580
Scott: That's right.

379
00:22:22,162 --> 00:22:30,733
Rym: So if you're going to be a PAX either because you win these badges or because you're awesome noon Monday how to win every game Monday.

380
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,138
Scott: Are you say packs for day?

381
00:22:32,238 --> 00:22:33,463
Scott: Oh my god I always forget.

382
00:22:33,524 --> 00:22:36,196
Rym: packs is four days until like the week before and I go oh fuck.

383
00:22:36,377 --> 00:22:41,340
Rym: and for me Packs is six days because I'm also gonna be a pack Sunday full day of packs.

384
00:22:41,801 --> 00:22:49,166
Rym: I'm gonna be a packs for six whole motherfucking days and I'm gonna be there the Tuesday before and the Tuesday after To play games in the lobby.

385
00:22:49,206 --> 00:22:55,859
Scott: This is I only hope permanent packs can come about within our lifetime If we all just move to one place.

386
00:22:56,601 --> 00:22:57,594
Scott: Permanent packs packs.

387
00:22:57,614 --> 00:23:00,931
Rym: Yeah packs New York It would you know what it should be like.

388
00:23:00,951 --> 00:23:04,360
Scott: you should be like one of those Just kick everyone out of white planes and make it pack.

389
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:10,140
Rym: It'll be like the Greek gentlemen societies that they have everywhere like the societies for like particular ethnic groups that moved to New York.

390
00:23:10,561 --> 00:23:12,288
Rym: We need a big one of those that's just packs.

391
00:23:12,469 --> 00:23:15,120
Scott: Oh, so it's like a certain neighborhood just becomes the nerd neighborhood.

392
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,310
Rym: Yep, and then there's a bunch of those facilities like where we had the first burning con.

393
00:23:18,551 --> 00:23:20,357
Scott: Mmm, which neighborhood should we take over?

394
00:23:20,377 --> 00:23:23,279
Rym: Uh, Well, obviously the Upper West Side.

395
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,389
Rym: So Yes, if you're gonna be a PAX dev let me know.

396
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,120
Rym: maybe we can hang out go to some panels together.

397
00:23:33,481 --> 00:23:39,520
Rym: If you're gonna be at the pack sky high charity prepacks, whatever event we're gonna be there you can play some games.

398
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:44,555
Rym: I hope you have a VIP because I don't know if we can bring non VIPs in the VIP room which we just paid money for.

399
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,867
Scott: and Otherwise, that's it spending too much money lately.

400
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,071
Scott: Anyone wants to send me money.

401
00:23:50,091 --> 00:23:52,480
Scott: I have a second packs badge.

402
00:23:52,862 --> 00:24:02,340
Rym: The good news, however, is that Part of the reason we're spending all this money is that we bought some equipment that's going to let us Continue to make content for the internet in great.

403
00:24:02,381 --> 00:24:08,055
Scott: I don't think there is any Equipment we could possibly get that we do not already have that we would need for anything at this point.

404
00:24:08,336 --> 00:24:11,167
Rym: having people to do The work is all we need.

405
00:24:11,268 --> 00:24:13,599
Rym: Yep, if someone else would video this shit.

406
00:24:15,193 --> 00:24:21,853
Rym: So yeah We're gonna try to use this shit at packs and at other places and expect a lot of video Content to be coming out of us in the near future.

407
00:24:22,034 --> 00:24:24,140
Rym: Mmm, so salad?

408
00:24:25,222 --> 00:24:26,840
Scott: Yeah, so we want to do food episode.

409
00:24:26,981 --> 00:24:31,599
Scott: We always seem to like the food but we needed something more specific than just food which had Rym wanted to do.

410
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,331
Rym: Yeah, what once called fire.

411
00:24:34,632 --> 00:24:36,380
Scott: so to be fair, that's a great episode.

412
00:24:37,121 --> 00:24:43,214
Scott: So yeah salad is a kind of food I eat a lot and make a lot So I guess we can talk for 30 minutes about it pretty easily.

413
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:44,340
Scott: I'm a big fan of salads.

414
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:45,967
Rym: I my whole life as a kid.

415
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:50,765
Rym: we would have a salad as a pre dish Or a side dish pretty much every meal.

416
00:24:50,846 --> 00:24:51,487
Scott: that is true.

417
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:56,120
Rym: What sickens me is that most people I know that is not the case.

418
00:24:56,922 --> 00:25:00,393
Rym: How what the fuck family did you grow up in a family that I don't know?

419
00:25:00,433 --> 00:25:02,660
Scott: ate McDonald's every dinner some fat family.

420
00:25:03,122 --> 00:25:08,167
Rym: Maybe I don't give it a McDonald's when I went to McDonald's as a kid unless it was breakfast I usually got the salad.

421
00:25:08,187 --> 00:25:16,620
Scott: when I was a kid McDonald's did not have salad and I stopped going to McDonald's when I was still in single digits of age and then I guess they had salad after that.

422
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:26,026
Scott: I think the last time I went to McDonald's or Burger King like for reals was when they had Thundercats toys.

423
00:25:26,146 --> 00:25:26,909
Scott: Oh, that's how long 80s.

424
00:25:27,531 --> 00:25:28,774
Rym: I went to a McDonald's.

425
00:25:29,336 --> 00:25:30,600
Scott: That's not to say I didn't eat fast food.

426
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,865
Scott: I went to many in Arby's.

427
00:25:32,227 --> 00:25:34,395
Rym: Yeah, we tried to go to that one army.

428
00:25:34,436 --> 00:25:36,838
Scott: It's not that many years ago We went to Wendy's near at RIT.

429
00:25:37,021 --> 00:25:41,411
Scott: Yeah But I did not go to McDonald's because Wendy's was right next to putt-putt.

430
00:25:41,672 --> 00:25:47,919
Rym: that had the DDR machine and they had $1 Chicken nuggets, let me tell you when you're poor you have no money at all.

431
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:49,223
Scott: Nuggets.

432
00:25:49,585 --> 00:25:52,639
Rym: five orders of $1 nuggets was a pretty good deal.

433
00:25:54,502 --> 00:25:56,271
Rym: So, uh, let's get right to the point.

434
00:25:56,292 --> 00:25:57,900
Rym: What's your favorite kind of salad Scott?

435
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:04,185
Rym: I like so many kinds of salad like if you had to name one like if you had to pick one salad To eat right now.

436
00:26:04,205 --> 00:26:05,931
Rym: Oh, right into salad.

437
00:26:05,972 --> 00:26:06,393
Scott: That's the thing.

438
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:10,771
Scott: My salad mood changes But one salad I go to then.

439
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:14,186
Scott: Mmm Well, I go to fresco a lot.

440
00:26:14,507 --> 00:26:15,992
Scott: that's like my favorite salad place.

441
00:26:16,293 --> 00:26:18,520
Scott: that's just a normal salad place not a fancy restaurant.

442
00:26:18,802 --> 00:26:21,420
Rym: Yeah, I gotta just salads for salad a lot.

443
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:27,400
Scott: And when I go there, I usually order one of two salads one that they've taken off the menu, but you can still order.

444
00:26:28,321 --> 00:26:33,900
Scott: You're one of those people which is the Fiesta and the other one which is they don't make the Fiesta anymore.

445
00:26:34,081 --> 00:26:34,504
Scott: Well, they do.

446
00:26:34,545 --> 00:26:38,739
Scott: you just say I want the Fiesta and they make it for you But it's not on the printed menu on the wall anymore.

447
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,795
Scott: Every single person who works there knows what it is someday.

448
00:26:41,855 --> 00:26:42,760
Rym: That will not be true.

449
00:26:42,981 --> 00:26:45,191
Rym: Maybe I too have lost a kingdom.

450
00:26:45,472 --> 00:26:49,195
Scott: if there's someone there teach it to them and Pat You know play it forward like if you're all right.

451
00:26:49,336 --> 00:26:54,620
Rym: RIT kids I know a lot of you listen go to while Java Wally's on campus and try to order a chaplain.

452
00:26:55,327 --> 00:26:56,599
Rym: That is the ultimate test.

453
00:26:57,525 --> 00:26:58,692
Scott: The other one that they have there.

454
00:26:58,732 --> 00:27:00,020
Scott: I really like is the South Beach.

455
00:27:00,561 --> 00:27:07,585
Scott: So the South Beach is like fruit and nuts and raisins and gorgonzola cheese and this, you know It's sort of that kind of salads.

456
00:27:07,605 --> 00:27:11,660
Scott: They're a summary and the Fiesta is basically like Chipotle in salad form.

457
00:27:12,061 --> 00:27:20,133
Scott: It's some like crispy fried chicken all chopped up with you know lettuce and Like sour cream.

458
00:27:20,153 --> 00:27:20,780
Rym: What are those salad?

459
00:27:22,122 --> 00:27:22,845
Scott: Little tortillas.

460
00:27:22,925 --> 00:27:29,980
Scott: It's basically just an enchilada tomato onion all kinds of cheese Some Tex-Mex dressing on there.

461
00:27:30,122 --> 00:27:40,379
Rym: I realized when I grew up as a kid There was a default salad because I lived in Michigan in the Midwest and in the Midwest it seems like the default salad is basically the chef salad.

462
00:27:40,983 --> 00:27:58,149
Rym: So cubed ham, maybe some cubed turkey Maybe some cubed salami some cubed Monterey Jack some cubed cheddar, maybe some cubed and like Colby sometimes iceberg lettuce onions Tons of ranch dressing and maybe bacon bits.

463
00:27:58,169 --> 00:28:04,870
Rym: Yeah, it was basically just a. it's almost like if you it's like Making cereal with croutons and instead of milk.

464
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:08,200
Rym: It's so croutons instead of cereal ranch dressing instead of milk.

465
00:28:08,261 --> 00:28:09,640
Rym: That's basically what these salads were.

466
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:14,507
Scott: So the chef salad and the Cobb salad are actually my least favorite Salad.

467
00:28:14,547 --> 00:28:15,633
Rym: I was saving that for the end.

468
00:28:15,713 --> 00:28:20,291
Scott: that is my least favorite Salads because the chef salad contains those cubed ham.

469
00:28:20,371 --> 00:28:21,997
Rym: Oh my god that cubed ham is so good.

470
00:28:22,017 --> 00:28:24,620
Scott: not a fan of Really any to be fair.

471
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:31,889
Rym: I'll give you that because if you don't like cubed ham if you don't like like pink boiled ham I can understand why you wouldn't like a chef.

472
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:39,120
Rym: the Cobb salad has the hard-boiled egg, which also not a fan Oh, but the hard-boiled egg Which is not a salad usually.

473
00:28:39,205 --> 00:28:43,998
Scott: No the time of the Cobb salad has the egg and the chef salad has the ham neither of which I'm a big fan of.

474
00:28:44,018 --> 00:28:47,620
Scott: so I tend to avoid those in the elementary school cafeteria.

475
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,322
Rym: You could order.

476
00:28:48,904 --> 00:28:54,820
Rym: usually they have two options for dinner or dinner for lunch and it was always like the bullshit food in cafeterias.

477
00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:01,100
Rym: That's awful like their chicken nuggets or the awful hamburger and then the other option was pretty much always the chef salad.

478
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:06,359
Rym: So I ate chef salad like every goddamn day, and that's also what I made at home.

479
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,044
Rym: Scott's poking me for some reason.

480
00:29:09,064 --> 00:29:10,850
Scott: Yeah, I just decided to do that cuz I can.

481
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,040
Rym: yeah, okay poking me with the microphone boom.

482
00:29:14,381 --> 00:29:20,319
Rym: Yeah, the extra microphone boom, but we don't need anymore because we bought those countryman microphones.

483
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:22,067
Scott: boom We're not gonna use this for the podcast.

484
00:29:22,147 --> 00:29:25,603
Rym: No, but I don't need this third boom anymore I guess not.

485
00:29:25,623 --> 00:29:27,489
Rym: we're using those for video no longer.

486
00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:29,335
Rym: We'll just gotta sit there for like an hour while I like.

487
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:33,605
Scott: position the stereo mics anyway More salad action.

488
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:34,990
Scott: so making a salad salad.

489
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:38,668
Scott: I usually make it home is very similar to the salad My parents would make it home.

490
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:40,460
Rym: Oh, so garden salad or Caesar salad?

491
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,544
Scott: Yeah, it's usually garden.

492
00:29:41,604 --> 00:29:44,115
Scott: ish right cuz basically once I got to high school.

493
00:29:44,255 --> 00:29:45,159
Scott: They told me to make this out.

494
00:29:45,721 --> 00:29:50,578
Scott: Yeah, so what we my dad doesn't like cucumber, but we had cucumber anyway, and he just wouldn't get any.

495
00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:57,200
Scott: yeah Amazingly some lettuce usually romaine iceberg something like that, okay, so lame-o lettuce standard lettuce.

496
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,511
Scott: Yeah, chop it up nicely tear it up.

497
00:29:59,551 --> 00:30:01,098
Scott: you with your hands actually not supposed to cut it.

498
00:30:02,588 --> 00:30:05,183
Rym: I learned that from From.

499
00:30:05,706 --> 00:30:06,169
Rym: oh my god.

500
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,619
Rym: What sitcom did I learn that from?

501
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,704
Scott: Anyway, go on Seinfeld.

502
00:30:09,765 --> 00:30:11,030
Rym: I don't know way before that.

503
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,411
Scott: okay.

504
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,656
Scott: You tear lettuce with your hands.

505
00:30:12,676 --> 00:30:13,138
Scott: You don't cut it.

506
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,473
Rym: Carrot Charles in charge really that there's an episode about that.

507
00:30:18,613 --> 00:30:19,997
Scott: apparently that guy's supposed to be a dick.

508
00:30:20,017 --> 00:30:20,358
Scott: I've heard.

509
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,729
Rym: uh I don't I can't comment on that.

510
00:30:23,111 --> 00:30:24,800
Scott: I've heard rumors that the Charles charge.

511
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,171
Scott: I heard rumors that I was named Scott.

512
00:30:27,191 --> 00:30:28,216
Rym: right Scott Bayo.

513
00:30:28,236 --> 00:30:28,839
Scott: is that the guy's name?

514
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:36,151
Rym: Anyway, I want Charles anyway charge of your salad.

515
00:30:36,511 --> 00:30:39,338
Rym: so yeah in that episode basically carrot lettuce.

516
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:53,674
Rym: in that episode Every time he walks into the room onion cucumber they're making a salad and someone's always there either cutting lettuce with scissors or With a knife and every time he comes and he's like ah you got a tear it why?

517
00:30:54,015 --> 00:30:55,800
Rym: otherwise it'll go brown why?

518
00:30:56,881 --> 00:30:58,680
Rym: You're just supposed to know that yeah, but why does it go brown?

519
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,202
Rym: I don't know.

520
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:02,080
Rym: and this happens like every time he comes in someone's fucking up the salad.

521
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,392
Scott: There is a time when you're not supposed to tear a lettuce with your hands.

522
00:31:06,954 --> 00:31:09,140
Scott: You know and that is a wedge salad.

523
00:31:09,805 --> 00:31:10,600
Rym: I like wedge salad.

524
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,019
Scott: I gotta use a big knife and make a big wedge and that lettuce and then you can make a wedge salad.

525
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:18,935
Rym: oh In the modern era people seem to agree that tearing the salad is pointless.

526
00:31:19,598 --> 00:31:19,879
Scott: why?

527
00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:22,999
Rym: uh That it's all a myth.

528
00:31:23,652 --> 00:31:26,516
Rym: Okay I'm doing some research here.

529
00:31:27,603 --> 00:31:29,850
Scott: So basically I depend on the kind of lettuce.

530
00:31:30,071 --> 00:31:30,893
Rym: That's what I think it is.

531
00:31:31,174 --> 00:31:32,679
Rym: I take this guy did an experiment.

532
00:31:33,482 --> 00:31:39,000
Rym: So I tear green leaf lettuce and red leaf lettuce unless I'm making a chopped salad.

533
00:31:39,926 --> 00:31:42,200
Rym: I don't actually as much as I really like.

534
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:50,229
Scott: If you're doing the thing that the salad places do where you just chop everything up like crazy before putting it in the bowl doesn't matter And it doesn't matter whether you tore it or chopped it.

535
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:55,459
Rym: when you make a chopped salad you put it in a bowl and actually Toss it With the dressing.

536
00:31:56,521 --> 00:31:59,220
Scott: No, I usually just put the dressing on and use my fork to just turn it over.

537
00:31:59,483 --> 00:32:00,920
Scott: No, I don't have a bowl.

538
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:06,101
Scott: It's like I got that dirty a whole extra bowl just to toss the salad in and then poor it's worth it Mmm.

539
00:32:06,302 --> 00:32:14,528
Rym: It's kind of like when you fry rice like if you if you put that effort in to quote every single grain of rice with a It is so worth all five flavors to come out.

540
00:32:14,548 --> 00:32:15,271
Scott: It'll be so golden.

541
00:32:15,291 --> 00:32:16,756
Scott: Yeah, you'll shed a manly tear.

542
00:32:16,776 --> 00:32:19,004
Rym: Oh In real life.

543
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:23,780
Rym: It doesn't matter how you divide the leaves as long as you don't apply dressing before storing for a prolonged period.

544
00:32:24,081 --> 00:32:27,352
Rym: Obviously the lettuce is browning on the ribs before it doesn't the edges.

545
00:32:27,372 --> 00:32:29,920
Rym: the difference between cut and torn is no longer important.

546
00:32:30,608 --> 00:32:31,398
Rym: Wait, no longer.

547
00:32:32,382 --> 00:32:33,408
Rym: When is this important?

548
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:34,776
Rym: All right, you talk.

549
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:42,200
Scott: I'm gonna read this See a typical salad I make lettuce tomato cucumber carrot peppers onions croutons.

550
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,565
Scott: What kind of peppers dressing?

551
00:32:43,585 --> 00:32:45,011
Scott: Oh any kind I can get right?

552
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:48,724
Scott: So sometimes the red ones sometimes the green ones Sometimes the yellow and the orange.

553
00:32:48,764 --> 00:32:51,012
Rym: We're not using like poblanos or jalapenos though.

554
00:32:51,675 --> 00:32:53,120
Scott: No, I mean those are in the Fiesta.

555
00:32:54,905 --> 00:33:03,560
Scott: That is more like I don't like one of those like taco salad using some kind of bell pepper whichever one looks good at the Store, maybe I'll buy a package of like the trace colores peppers.

556
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,048
Rym: All right, this guy argues the opposite.

557
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:07,060
Rym: tearing lettuce is always worth the effort.

558
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:07,882
Scott: Okay, why?

559
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:11,611
Rym: uh, it takes a reasonably similar amount of time and the different.

560
00:33:11,651 --> 00:33:12,473
Rym: but what?

561
00:33:13,174 --> 00:33:14,798
Rym: what if you were planning on eating a god?

562
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,564
Rym: Damn it you people.

563
00:33:17,266 --> 00:33:18,270
Rym: This is too complicated.

564
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,117
Scott: I got to call the Culinary Institute.

565
00:33:20,218 --> 00:33:20,700
Rym: Yeah, we do.

566
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,187
Rym: Well, yeah, I got to see what they learn in their class.

567
00:33:23,207 --> 00:33:23,929
Rym: We should pull.

568
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,740
Scott: we should pull multiple chefs and get their opinion.

569
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:32,380
Scott: I was always told by Like nine out of ten dentists to prove of this toothpaste.

570
00:33:32,701 --> 00:33:36,439
Scott: How many chefs out of how many say you should tell the right Ma's and Ma's?

571
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,887
Rym: Told me to tear it as did Charles in charge.

572
00:33:38,947 --> 00:33:40,693
Rym: the internet seems to think that it doesn't matter.

573
00:33:41,255 --> 00:33:41,536
Rym: Okay.

574
00:33:41,877 --> 00:33:42,860
Scott: Anyway, whatever.

575
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:46,630
Scott: So yeah What do you think of lettuce in a bag?

576
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:46,670
Scott: I?

577
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,999
Rym: Used to buy that when I didn't have a lot of time to cook but fuck that now.

578
00:33:52,722 --> 00:33:57,037
Rym: See now I always get all fresh everything and prepare the salad entirely from scratch.

579
00:33:57,257 --> 00:34:03,860
Scott: when I was growing up My mom had mad Tupperware including this green bowl a special green bowl that you could put a head of lettuce in.

580
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,524
Rym: Yeah, guess what?

581
00:34:04,564 --> 00:34:05,268
Rym: We got one of those.

582
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:11,357
Scott: now if you bought lettuce that comes in head shape We got one and if you put lettuce in that bowl, it stayed good for so fucking long.

583
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:11,980
Scott: It was amazing.

584
00:34:12,121 --> 00:34:14,998
Scott: that's like this incredible green Tupperware bowl that they don't make anymore.

585
00:34:15,018 --> 00:34:25,120
Scott: and Because I didn't have that bowl and whenever I bought some kind of lettuce It went bad pretty quick even though iceberg lettuce for a dollar is the cheapest even romaine lettuce, right?

586
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,159
Scott: It's like buying it's the cheapest way even in like a escarole or something.

587
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,480
Scott: But and had the bowls lettuce went bad so fast.

588
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,500
Scott: Okay These people bought lettuce in a bag to avoid, you know.

589
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,300
Scott: So I'd spend less money and use more lettuce and be more efficient.

590
00:34:40,742 --> 00:34:43,713
Scott: But when it once I got out of college, I went on eBay.

591
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:45,518
Scott: I bought that motherfucking bowl.

592
00:34:46,121 --> 00:34:48,969
Scott: Sadly, I as my no more bag lettuce for me.

593
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:52,760
Rym: I really like iceberg lettuce, but which is you know the head?

594
00:34:53,081 --> 00:35:01,711
Rym: Yeah, unlike like green leaf lettuce, like I can't put in a bowl like that cuz it's long big Yep, and lately I've been getting Batavian lettuce was just like this monster.

595
00:35:01,731 --> 00:35:02,273
Rym: Mmm.

596
00:35:02,513 --> 00:35:02,955
Rym: It's good.

597
00:35:03,336 --> 00:35:04,680
Scott: You can put other non head lettuce.

598
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:10,716
Scott: I mean there are lettuces that are sort of head like like the escarole is sort of like a. you know It's a different shape, but it's still a head.

599
00:35:10,898 --> 00:35:12,419
Scott: true You can put a cabbage in there.

600
00:35:12,802 --> 00:35:16,000
Rym: But the problem is I can feed the rabbits because we have to feed the rabbits fresh greens.

601
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,020
Rym: So we've alternate from the parsley and cilantro and lettuces and all these things.

602
00:35:19,563 --> 00:35:25,620
Rym: Uh Rabbits can't eat iceberg lettuce because it's got too much cellulose and we'll give them gas and get basically a hundred percent cellulose.

603
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,033
Scott: It might as well be celery in leaf form and as a kid.

604
00:35:29,675 --> 00:35:35,997
Rym: I always had this perception that Iceberg lettuce was like the bad lettuce like iceberg.

605
00:35:36,097 --> 00:35:36,720
Scott: It's not a bad.

606
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:41,700
Rym: Let's just a general that no not bad like taste bad like not as good for you as other lettuces.

607
00:35:41,861 --> 00:35:43,653
Scott: It's just as good for you as other lettuces.

608
00:35:43,694 --> 00:35:46,686
Scott: That's actually debatable But it's a generic lettuce.

609
00:35:46,806 --> 00:35:46,927
Scott: right?

610
00:35:46,947 --> 00:35:49,314
Rym: iceberg lettuce is the lettuce that you use to make a salad.

611
00:35:49,334 --> 00:35:53,687
Rym: that's primarily consisting of cheese and Meat and croutons and dressing.

612
00:35:53,807 --> 00:35:57,881
Scott: Yeah, is it like bears the most weight and it has the most water going on Like.

613
00:35:57,961 --> 00:36:00,616
Scott: I was never much better for sandwiches and other lettuces.

614
00:36:00,697 --> 00:36:01,300
Rym: That is true.

615
00:36:01,381 --> 00:36:04,120
Scott: It is the same as the kind of sandwich sandwich though, right?

616
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:04,722
Scott: Some what?

617
00:36:04,782 --> 00:36:08,919
Scott: sometimes you make a sandwich and you want those those lettuces that are just like leaves.

618
00:36:09,924 --> 00:36:16,651
Scott: You know like I do that you know, it feels like you're eating a tree Kind of sandwich chunk of romaine just across the entire sandwich.

619
00:36:16,671 --> 00:36:23,194
Scott: in that case see I like doing that flavor wise But often it creates this surface for things just slide off of.

620
00:36:23,616 --> 00:36:25,266
Rym: ah, you're stacking incorrectly You didn't?

621
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:32,283
Scott: you never worked at the Bellas But lettuce at the bottom things drip into it and then the romaine has this chute down the middle and all this lettuce goes on Top.

622
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,049
Scott: No, this goes.

623
00:36:33,089 --> 00:36:35,388
Rym: lettuce goes at the very top It goes in the bottom.

624
00:36:35,489 --> 00:36:36,458
Rym: lettuce goes on the top.

625
00:36:36,518 --> 00:36:36,700
Scott: bottom.

626
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:36,881
Scott: You.

627
00:36:36,921 --> 00:36:42,100
Scott: basically you make a salad on your on top of the bread and then you put the meat and cheese on top of that.

628
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,747
Rym: You don't know shit about making sandwich.

629
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:44,389
Scott: I do know shit.

630
00:36:44,409 --> 00:36:45,594
Rym: We gotta do Sean sandwiches.

631
00:36:45,614 --> 00:36:50,011
Scott: Okay next Thursday Thursday is no longer whatever night.

632
00:36:50,071 --> 00:36:52,040
Scott: It's no longer the lounge now food night.

633
00:36:52,902 --> 00:36:54,065
Rym: But here's the difference.

634
00:36:54,306 --> 00:36:56,873
Rym: if I use iceberg lettuce may have done sandwiches already.

635
00:36:57,114 --> 00:37:03,395
Rym: I'm gonna put some creamy ass Dressing on oh for sure if I use because it's watery dressing.

636
00:37:03,415 --> 00:37:06,938
Rym: It's already so watery I would never put oil and vinegar on that.

637
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:10,069
Scott: oil Just slide right off like a friggin slip and slide.

638
00:37:10,149 --> 00:37:13,240
Rym: oil and vinegar is if the individual lettuces had care.

639
00:37:13,388 --> 00:37:19,624
Scott: Yeah oil and vinegar has got to go on a salad where the lettuce can actually like absorb some of that maybe An iceberg.

640
00:37:19,644 --> 00:37:21,132
Scott: it just nothing sticks to that.

641
00:37:21,213 --> 00:37:24,680
Scott: It just goes if you put oil and vinegar You're gonna get a pool of oil and vinegar at the bottom of the bowl.

642
00:37:24,803 --> 00:37:25,198
Scott: You won't eat.

643
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,625
Rym: well oil and vinegar is got to be used.

644
00:37:26,665 --> 00:37:41,312
Rym: if the salad is an appetizer or not the main meal and if the salad consists primarily of greens that are themselves high quality It's got to be a salad that would taste good with no dressing Yep, because then the oil and vinegar is just an enhancement to that.

645
00:37:41,412 --> 00:37:42,716
Rym: Otherwise, perfect salad.

646
00:37:42,857 --> 00:37:43,037
Rym: Mm-hmm.

647
00:37:44,022 --> 00:37:56,120
Rym: But if I'm making a you know big ol like Rym is hungry and this salad is dinner then the salad actually consists mostly of meat and the lettuce is basically just A vehicle to make me feel a little less bad about eating a bowl of me.

648
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,960
Scott: I actually almost never put meat on a salad.

649
00:37:59,422 --> 00:38:05,548
Scott: The only time I get me in the salad is like if it's like, you know Make that myself.

650
00:38:05,609 --> 00:38:06,960
Scott: I'll only get that at places.

651
00:38:07,241 --> 00:38:10,380
Rym: I'll make that a lot usually for dinner like if the salad is dinner.

652
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,898
Scott: But I should do that like if I make a steak.

653
00:38:12,261 --> 00:38:17,240
Scott: I should just make two steaks and then instead of just usually I'll use the leftover to make a sandwich.

654
00:38:17,401 --> 00:38:19,791
Scott: I should cut the leftover up and make a salad.

655
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,880
Scott: I just don't think to do that, but that's a good idea.

656
00:38:22,442 --> 00:38:27,300
Rym: So I also put I always get a little bit of like arugula or cilantro and arugula is real good.

657
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,030
Rym: And arugula is great, but don't make the mistake of thinking.

658
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,013
Rym: Hey, I like arugula.

659
00:38:31,294 --> 00:38:32,820
Rym: I'll make a small side salad.

660
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,863
Rym: This is 100% arugula.

661
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:34,445
Rym: Wrong.

662
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:35,308
Scott: Bad news.

663
00:38:35,348 --> 00:38:37,796
Scott: Notice, you know, it's okay to use 100% iceberg 100% romaine.

664
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:41,738
Scott: Those other kinds of lettuces usually got to be mixed in.

665
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,445
Rym: Yeah, like dandelion greens.

666
00:38:43,685 --> 00:38:48,420
Rym: if you put more than one big ol green of dandelion in your salad that thing tastes like bitter shit.

667
00:38:48,741 --> 00:38:50,467
Scott: Yeah, that's why I don't eat it at all because it's nasty.

668
00:38:50,487 --> 00:38:50,969
Scott: It's not food either.

669
00:38:50,989 --> 00:38:52,414
Rym: I don't know what your problem is with dandelion greens.

670
00:38:52,434 --> 00:38:52,855
Rym: It's not food.

671
00:38:53,056 --> 00:38:55,651
Scott: Dandelion greens are delicious But then you just said it was bitter shit.

672
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:56,739
Scott: Yeah, which one is it?

673
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,320
Rym: So are most of the kinds of green vegetables that you saute.

674
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,137
Scott: Yeah, don't eat that shit or saute it first, right?

675
00:39:03,177 --> 00:39:05,184
Scott: Especially Kale spinach.

676
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:06,448
Rym: don't eat raw kale.

677
00:39:06,488 --> 00:39:07,371
Rym: you motherfuckers.

678
00:39:07,431 --> 00:39:09,820
Scott: people be kale's like this huge trending motherfucker.

679
00:39:10,641 --> 00:39:11,486
Scott: That shit is poison.

680
00:39:11,506 --> 00:39:12,794
Scott: Yo, so is spinach.

681
00:39:12,834 --> 00:39:16,351
Scott: unless you cook it It's loaded with this acid called oxalic acid.

682
00:39:16,371 --> 00:39:17,274
Rym: Spinach is not as bad.

683
00:39:17,535 --> 00:39:18,560
Scott: spinach is actually worse.

684
00:39:18,961 --> 00:39:22,738
Rym: Well, because people don't eat as much of it, you know, you don't make a whole salad with nothing but spinach.

685
00:39:22,858 --> 00:39:23,944
Scott: obviously The point is it tastes great.

686
00:39:23,964 --> 00:39:35,186
Scott: I'm not gonna deny that Kale and even worse spinach in their raw forms contain a ton of oxalic acid Which is just straight-up bad for you.

687
00:39:35,568 --> 00:39:38,698
Scott: the same way that like trans fat is bad for you, right?

688
00:39:38,758 --> 00:39:39,360
Scott: It's just bad.

689
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,194
Scott: There's nothing good about eating that acid.

690
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:41,739
Scott: It's just bad.

691
00:39:42,462 --> 00:39:49,887
Scott: So if you want to eat kale or spinach, you should either eat a very small quantity of it raw like, okay There's a couple spinach leaves in your salad.

692
00:39:49,907 --> 00:39:50,489
Scott: No problem.

693
00:39:50,509 --> 00:39:52,196
Scott: You won't die big deal, right?

694
00:39:52,336 --> 00:39:52,657
Scott: I've eaten.

695
00:39:52,678 --> 00:39:53,300
Scott: I eat red meat.

696
00:39:53,341 --> 00:39:54,174
Scott: That's bad for you, too.

697
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,300
Scott: But don't eat a big huge pile of kale.

698
00:39:58,561 --> 00:40:01,675
Scott: I see salad put at these salad places that are 100% kale raw not good.

699
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,164
Rym: Those people always get the same thing.

700
00:40:04,184 --> 00:40:07,915
Rym: They order like a kale and quinoa blend as possible salad.

701
00:40:08,135 --> 00:40:09,720
Rym: Yeah, I hate quinoa.

702
00:40:09,921 --> 00:40:10,664
Rym: It's quinoa.

703
00:40:10,724 --> 00:40:11,848
Scott: I think it depends.

704
00:40:11,989 --> 00:40:12,350
Rym: You know what?

705
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:12,872
Rym: You know what?

706
00:40:13,173 --> 00:40:13,515
Rym: You know what?

707
00:40:13,535 --> 00:40:16,227
Rym: I'm gonna call it for non quinoa Because I don't care.

708
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:16,891
Scott: I don't care.

709
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:17,635
Scott: It's bad.

710
00:40:17,675 --> 00:40:18,500
Scott: It doesn't taste good.

711
00:40:18,821 --> 00:40:18,942
Rym: It's.

712
00:40:19,363 --> 00:40:21,714
Rym: it's the kind of thing that people eat out of obligate.

713
00:40:21,734 --> 00:40:23,220
Scott: They like they like liking it.

714
00:40:23,401 --> 00:40:26,960
Rym: I should eat something healthy and I've noticed that with salads to a lot of people.

715
00:40:27,101 --> 00:40:36,920
Rym: I believe that this is healthy despite any evidence suggesting so I think a lot of people Would prefer to eat a salad comprised and mostly of ranch dressing and croutons.

716
00:40:37,724 --> 00:40:40,780
Scott: It's called a Caesar salad, but except that Caesar dressing.

717
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:52,200
Rym: But they will eat oil and vinegar on a bland salad Because they they perceive that it's better for them or they don't want to be seen as the person eating the ridiculously fatty salad.

718
00:40:52,662 --> 00:40:54,269
Scott: I think they just believe it's better for them.

719
00:40:54,671 --> 00:41:00,271
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time if you don't like marketing works don't get that on your salad.

720
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,615
Rym: if you like ranch dressing go for it.

721
00:41:01,635 --> 00:41:02,999
Rym: unless you're fat then don't.

722
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,105
Scott: If you're fat, no get it.

723
00:41:05,245 --> 00:41:05,506
Scott: It's these.

724
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,193
Scott: you're eating a salad and not McDonald's.

725
00:41:07,856 --> 00:41:10,687
Rym: I could construct a salad That's way worse for you than any hamburger.

726
00:41:10,727 --> 00:41:11,009
Scott: Mr.

727
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:11,993
Scott: Meat in every salad.

728
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:12,997
Scott: You're putting a hamburger in your salad.

729
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,965
Scott: That's where I grew up in the Midwest.

730
00:41:15,126 --> 00:41:15,467
Scott: Yeah.

731
00:41:15,949 --> 00:41:18,379
Scott: No, my salads rarely contain meat.

732
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,560
Rym: Actually, usually I'll do a lot of cheese and nuts and not meat because I've been cutting a lot of meat.

733
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,813
Scott: I know it's also rarely contain cheese.

734
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:28,464
Rym: Uh It's very rare.

735
00:41:28,484 --> 00:41:32,300
Rym: I will not put cheese in my salad unless the salad is just an appetizer.

736
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:33,900
Rym: Not even not an appetizer.

737
00:41:33,941 --> 00:41:34,658
Scott: I do enjoy cheese.

738
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:41,548
Scott: So if it's just a side dish like I have the partition plate like when you go to a diner and there's like like Cheddar and whatever in the salad.

739
00:41:41,568 --> 00:41:42,171
Scott: That's real good.

740
00:41:42,191 --> 00:41:44,020
Scott: I love that shit a cubed or shredded.

741
00:41:44,522 --> 00:41:48,380
Scott: I like the shredded because then you can sort of mix it up a lot more especially with a carrot shredded.

742
00:41:48,741 --> 00:41:50,009
Scott: Yeah, it's.

743
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:52,464
Rym: I've noticed Emily doesn't like the same kind of salad I do like.

744
00:41:52,545 --> 00:41:54,520
Rym: I make really over-the-top salads.

745
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:58,393
Rym: But the problem is I think I like croutons and sunflowers way more.

746
00:41:58,433 --> 00:41:59,637
Scott: you like croutons, huh?

747
00:41:59,657 --> 00:42:00,419
Scott: You don't say yeah.

748
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,327
Rym: Well, I mean, they're basically advanced crackers.

749
00:42:02,809 --> 00:42:04,959
Scott: I also like root does but only in salad.

750
00:42:05,019 --> 00:42:05,240
Rym: why?

751
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,951
Rym: Why arbitrarily limit yourself join me?

752
00:42:08,971 --> 00:42:14,511
Rym: It's not an arbitrary limit It is the very definition of an arbitrary.

753
00:42:14,551 --> 00:42:17,520
Scott: I just eat ketchup then it tastes great because that's the condiment.

754
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:18,505
Scott: So are croutons.

755
00:42:18,525 --> 00:42:19,630
Scott: They're a salad condiment.

756
00:42:19,931 --> 00:42:21,640
Rym: Uh, no, they're not because you can eat them on their own.

757
00:42:22,601 --> 00:42:24,248
Scott: You you can eat ketchup on its own.

758
00:42:24,689 --> 00:42:25,131
Rym: You shouldn't.

759
00:42:25,613 --> 00:42:27,280
Scott: you shouldn't eat croutons on their own either.

760
00:42:28,502 --> 00:42:31,660
Rym: What about if you crumble up crackers into your salad suddenly you're not allowed to eat crack?

761
00:42:31,741 --> 00:42:33,432
Scott: That's only because you didn't have croutons.

762
00:42:33,452 --> 00:42:33,996
Scott: cuz you suck.

763
00:42:34,117 --> 00:42:37,842
Rym: That is true Don't?

764
00:42:37,882 --> 00:42:41,460
Rym: every times in my life when I was a kid I would like make a salad like in high school.

765
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:45,560
Rym: I can come home didn't have any fucking crew time, but I'd make the salad first and I assume we have croutons.

766
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:51,606
Rym: I reach in there's no croutons and you assume then I'm like going through the whole house looking for like anything crunchy to put in that salad.

767
00:42:51,626 --> 00:42:52,090
Rym: Mm-hmm.

768
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:57,117
Rym: I Really actually like the crunchily onions, but I never keep them around.

769
00:42:57,379 --> 00:43:01,240
Rym: so Don't think we should really talk about.

770
00:43:02,183 --> 00:43:05,412
Scott: I was just thinking about those two seconds ago.

771
00:43:05,432 --> 00:43:06,134
Rym: I love those things.

772
00:43:06,234 --> 00:43:07,317
Scott: gonna buy some on the way home.

773
00:43:07,478 --> 00:43:08,060
Rym: Oh my gosh.

774
00:43:08,967 --> 00:43:10,500
Scott: So I don't need hot dogs for dinner.

775
00:43:10,661 --> 00:43:15,719
Rym: And I feel like we should not talk about the other branch of salads of potato salads.

776
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:16,100
Rym: in the light.

777
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,469
Rym: That's a separate show mean potato salad chicken salad.

778
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,200
Scott: The other thing is I'm not really into a lot of those.

779
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:35,802
Rym: I am increasingly into them and I've always always like potato salad because that goes if you go to a garden party in the Midwest plus someone's bringing a ranch dressing heavy chef salad and the same person usually brings Potatoes.

780
00:43:35,842 --> 00:43:44,386
Scott: the reason I don't like a lot of those is because most of them tend to just be a bunch of stuff all mixed up Basically drowned in mayonnaise.

781
00:43:44,546 --> 00:43:46,373
Scott: and I'm yeah, not big on man.

782
00:43:46,433 --> 00:43:48,240
Scott: I'm big on mayonnaise pasta salad.

783
00:43:48,401 --> 00:43:50,529
Scott: I love pasta not big on pasta salad.

784
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:53,399
Rym: I just made a pesto pasta salad with pine nuts the other day.

785
00:43:53,681 --> 00:43:54,805
Scott: Oh, I still could be good.

786
00:43:54,866 --> 00:43:55,689
Scott: It's not like a boy.

787
00:43:55,709 --> 00:43:56,332
Scott: It's not mayonnaise.

788
00:43:56,352 --> 00:43:58,240
Rym: Yeah, make a pesto pasta salad sometime.

789
00:43:58,381 --> 00:44:00,152
Scott: That could be good right fucking amazing.

790
00:44:00,212 --> 00:44:00,715
Scott: It was great.

791
00:44:00,756 --> 00:44:01,460
Rym: Here's the secret.

792
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:04,270
Rym: But however much butter you think you're gonna use when you're less more.

793
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:05,775
Rym: Yeah, just butter it up.

794
00:44:06,297 --> 00:44:07,564
Scott: Yeah, that's that's great I don't like.

795
00:44:07,604 --> 00:44:09,120
Scott: but sometimes you get that pasta salad.

796
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,436
Scott: It's like pasta and some vegetables and some potato bits all drowned in mayonnaise and the pot it's cold.

797
00:44:14,476 --> 00:44:16,485
Scott: now because they cook the pasta It's supposed to be cold.

798
00:44:16,827 --> 00:44:18,055
Scott: Yeah, I don't not a big into that.

799
00:44:18,075 --> 00:44:22,389
Scott: Yeah, right I want the pasta at least be warm and drowned in something.

800
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:23,933
Scott: That's not mayonnaise.

801
00:44:24,114 --> 00:44:25,257
Rym: Sometimes I'll live dangerously.

802
00:44:25,297 --> 00:44:29,364
Rym: instead of using hard-boiled eggs I'll use deviled eggs Not big into any.

803
00:44:29,745 --> 00:44:30,970
Rym: I don't know what's up with you and eggs.

804
00:44:31,612 --> 00:44:32,235
Scott: I like eggs.

805
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:33,640
Scott: I just don't like weird.

806
00:44:34,142 --> 00:44:34,866
Rym: So tomatoes.

807
00:44:35,368 --> 00:44:36,493
Rym: what tomato do you use?

808
00:44:36,513 --> 00:44:38,020
Scott: Oh for a salad?

809
00:44:38,104 --> 00:44:42,655
Rym: Yeah Depends on the salad because I used to not know better when I was young.

810
00:44:42,675 --> 00:44:43,980
Rym: and I just get the beefsteak tomatoes.

811
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:44,763
Rym: No, what's that?

812
00:44:44,783 --> 00:44:46,267
Scott: That's for sandwiches lately.

813
00:44:46,288 --> 00:44:50,100
Rym: I only I pretty much only use Zima's or like heirloom cherry tomatoes.

814
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,608
Scott: Okay, so sometimes I'll you.

815
00:44:52,728 --> 00:44:55,317
Scott: obviously if you have a tomato you grew yourself like a cherry tomato.

816
00:44:55,597 --> 00:44:56,260
Scott: That's a great ago.

817
00:44:56,721 --> 00:44:59,774
Scott: Okay, any tomato you grew yourself just tastes better than any tomato.

818
00:44:59,794 --> 00:45:00,799
Scott: you combine this for sure, right?

819
00:45:01,441 --> 00:45:06,280
Scott: There is a brand of tomato they have at the store that's expensive that actually tastes almost as good as backyard tomato.

820
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:08,269
Scott: So you can buy that and just shell out the money.

821
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:08,731
Scott: That's also.

822
00:45:08,771 --> 00:45:10,820
Rym: if you're doing that just buy any tomatoes.

823
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,306
Scott: I think it's like a cherry tomato or a grape tomato or something like that but by the ones that are not red.

824
00:45:15,627 --> 00:45:24,478
Rym: because though basically from what I've read read the The things that make tomatoes taste good and the same and the jeans that make tomatoes red.

825
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,400
Rym: Nah, there's a there's like a negative alignment there.

826
00:45:28,842 --> 00:45:31,316
Rym: So if you breed tomatoes to look good, they don't taste good.

827
00:45:31,336 --> 00:45:41,657
Scott: Yep Also, you know a plum tomatoes not bad because you can sort of cut it up nicely and the tomatoes on the vine are usually More expensive, but there's usually reason for that.

828
00:45:42,765 --> 00:45:43,620
Rym: Yeah, then the grocery store.

829
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:50,096
Scott: I found they're not as good and also those bends of the grocery store Like one grocery store near me has so many different kinds of tomatoes and they are all horrible.

830
00:45:50,157 --> 00:45:52,044
Scott: and the other store You know has like.

831
00:45:52,486 --> 00:45:56,200
Scott: the thing is you tend to lean towards the tomatoes that are just sort of out in the open.

832
00:45:56,802 --> 00:45:59,592
Scott: They always had the prepackaged ones and they're always sort of suspicious.

833
00:45:59,913 --> 00:46:01,660
Scott: but actually those are usually really good.

834
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,746
Scott: They just cost a lot more.

835
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:12,039
Rym: I found if I'm making like a garden salad What I'll usually do is take moderately sized like holding my hand tomatoes and I'll cut them into like fifths wedges.

836
00:46:12,542 --> 00:46:13,873
Rym: I'll put the wedges just in the salad.

837
00:46:13,893 --> 00:46:14,800
Scott: Yeah, that's what you gotta do wedges.

838
00:46:15,121 --> 00:46:17,893
Scott: I also cut the wedges in half to make like mini pyramids.

839
00:46:18,034 --> 00:46:20,866
Rym: No because I found if I do that Usually it's too mushy and watery.

840
00:46:20,906 --> 00:46:23,960
Scott: Well, that's not you got to get a tomato that has more structure to it.

841
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,333
Scott: Not one that's all full of water, but usually the watery ones taste better.

842
00:46:27,513 --> 00:46:29,220
Scott: No, the structurally ones taste better.

843
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,652
Rym: But if I'm making a child, I like tomato.

844
00:46:30,753 --> 00:46:31,600
Scott: I like tomato flesh.

845
00:46:31,721 --> 00:46:33,732
Scott: I don't really like tomato water and seeds.

846
00:46:33,913 --> 00:46:43,519
Rym: if I'm doing the chop toss salad What I'll do is not let this might seem like overkill, but it's worth it I'll get cherry tomatoes or the Zima tomatoes like the little ones the orange ones and I'll cut them all in half.

847
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:47,034
Rym: That's a good idea because then you get the benefit of both worlds.

848
00:46:47,355 --> 00:46:53,700
Rym: Mm-hmm Yeah Occasionally, I'll do celery but I find that celery doesn't add a lot to the salad.

849
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:54,786
Scott: No, I don't buy celery.

850
00:46:54,806 --> 00:46:57,160
Scott: too often you all it's mostly cuz you have to buy so much celery.

851
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:57,662
Rym: Yeah, and I never.

852
00:46:57,702 --> 00:46:59,631
Rym: I use like two stalks of it and then the rest gets.

853
00:46:59,672 --> 00:47:02,529
Scott: I'll have to just eat celery straight up to Finish it all I know.

854
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,860
Rym: and I don't like eating celery straight up.

855
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:11,583
Scott: I like it in like soup carrot pro tip instead of buying like the you know carrots in a bag or Baby care.

856
00:47:11,603 --> 00:47:15,400
Rym: why baby carrots are not baby carrots as regular carrots cut down to look like baby care.

857
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:19,820
Scott: We know that God you all didn't I were you go to the actual vegetable section.

858
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,625
Scott: You can buy the big motherfucking.

859
00:47:21,665 --> 00:47:22,247
Scott: care careful.

860
00:47:22,307 --> 00:47:22,668
Rym: Careful.

861
00:47:22,728 --> 00:47:27,160
Rym: The ain't the larger a carrot is the inside is usually kind of bitter.

862
00:47:27,321 --> 00:47:27,803
Scott: I like that.

863
00:47:27,883 --> 00:47:28,726
Scott: I like the bigger.

864
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:32,501
Scott: to me at least the big carrot tastes way better than any of the carrots They have.

865
00:47:33,064 --> 00:47:34,629
Rym: I like to get the baby carrot.

866
00:47:34,649 --> 00:47:35,733
Rym: That's actually a baby.

867
00:47:35,793 --> 00:47:37,580
Scott: can I usually buy two big carrots?

868
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,745
Scott: And I'll use one for salad.

869
00:47:38,765 --> 00:47:39,648
Scott: just eat the other one.

870
00:47:39,668 --> 00:47:42,500
Rym: Well, if I get a big carrot, I shred it into the salad.

871
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:47,939
Scott: No, I just instead of cutting it I cut the carrot and even though it goes from small to big so it's hard to cut evenly.

872
00:47:47,979 --> 00:47:52,460
Scott: now Technique where you rotate the carrot so all your carrot bits are equally sized.

873
00:47:52,985 --> 00:47:54,420
Scott: As long as do it right or what?

874
00:47:54,580 --> 00:48:02,875
Rym: I'll do is I'll get the moderately to bigger sized carrots And if I don't even I don't want to shred it What I can do is I can chop it pretty fine or I'll slice it is usually pretty good.

875
00:48:03,015 --> 00:48:04,561
Rym: or if I really want to Go nuts.

876
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:09,139
Rym: I'll take that carrot and put it on the mandolin and just make like nice thin long carrot strip

877
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:11,653
Scott: something else You can do just take your peeler peel the carrot

878
00:48:11,794 --> 00:48:12,619
Rym: and then keep peeling it

879
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,753
Scott: And then once it's peeled go over to the salad bowl and peel peel peel.

880
00:48:16,773 --> 00:48:18,237
Scott: Yeah Julianne.

881
00:48:18,518 --> 00:48:20,871
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I'm big fan of the carrots.

882
00:48:20,911 --> 00:48:21,960
Rym: I'll put those in almost everything.

883
00:48:22,342 --> 00:48:25,195
Rym: I'm a big fan of the nuts to like sunflower and walnuts.

884
00:48:25,376 --> 00:48:26,199
Scott: walnut is good.

885
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,029
Rym: Sunflower seed maybe depends on the salad again.

886
00:48:30,249 --> 00:48:32,135
Scott: Walnut is really like the ultimate salad nut.

887
00:48:32,155 --> 00:48:33,700
Scott: It's also one of the best nuts period.

888
00:48:33,801 --> 00:48:34,285
Rym: Yeah, it is.

889
00:48:34,305 --> 00:48:35,800
Rym: I just got new walnuts for salad.

890
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,325
Scott: like you don't put a peanut in a salad.

891
00:48:37,626 --> 00:48:42,060
Rym: my thing lately I haven't especially when it's like cooler out is I like to make a?

892
00:48:42,623 --> 00:48:45,039
Rym: That's like a lot of different kinds of greens.

893
00:48:46,103 --> 00:48:52,759
Rym: Maybe no tomatoes at all really finely chopped peppers goat cheese oil and vinegar.

894
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:59,300
Scott: The thing with that kind of salad is there's something psychological about having a lot of different colors in the salad.

895
00:48:59,441 --> 00:48:59,865
Scott: I don't like.

896
00:49:00,068 --> 00:49:04,829
Rym: that's why I put ready a red Decio in the salad even though it doesn't add a lot of flavor.

897
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:11,015
Scott: even if the salad as is amazing if it's like all green It's sort of like I can't.

898
00:49:11,096 --> 00:49:11,982
Scott: it's hard to eat I like.

899
00:49:12,002 --> 00:49:19,780
Rym: that's why I gotta eat the carrot the tomato, you know peppers that are different color I'm telling you get to get a radicchio and just cut a little bit of it into every salad.

900
00:49:20,282 --> 00:49:20,683
Rym: Wait a minute.

901
00:49:20,703 --> 00:49:21,085
Rym: Wait a minute.

902
00:49:21,105 --> 00:49:23,413
Rym: I just went to Wikipedia and the fourth heading here is toxicity.

903
00:49:23,433 --> 00:49:31,807
Scott: Uh So don't eat right, that's that's if you use chicory in Coffee, we know the chicory is poison.

904
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:32,731
Rym: I like chicory though.

905
00:49:32,751 --> 00:49:33,695
Rym: Okay.

906
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:37,526
Rym: Yeah Blah-blah chicory farms, whatever.

907
00:49:37,566 --> 00:49:37,726
Rym: Yeah.

908
00:49:37,746 --> 00:49:38,929
Rym: Riccio is good in salads.

909
00:49:39,631 --> 00:49:39,752
Scott: Mmm.

910
00:49:40,373 --> 00:49:42,980
Rym: It's a little bitter but not as bitter as like dandelions.

911
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,007
Rym: Alright, I kind of wanna make a salad now.

912
00:49:46,268 --> 00:49:46,890
Scott: Yeah, I'm hungry.

913
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:48,394
Scott: I got a dinner feeling salad.

914
00:49:48,415 --> 00:49:49,317
Rym: We did a food show.

915
00:49:49,337 --> 00:49:49,418
Scott: Yeah.

916
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,245
Rym: So, uh, I think if I had to pick a salad though That's my favorite as much.
