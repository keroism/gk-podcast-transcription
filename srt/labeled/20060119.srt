00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,171
Scott: It's Thursday, January 19th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,652 --> 00:00:17,361
Scott: Tonight, Conventions Part 2.

3
00:00:17,361 --> 00:00:18,073
Scott: Let's do this!

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:25,500
Scott: Alright, so my work is sort of in the process of transferring me from the New York City office to the middle-of-fuck-no-where office.

5
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:39,680
Scott: So, on Wednesday, I had to go work in this office, which meant an hour drive both ways, because locksmith was coming, and I had to let him in and write the amount of money on the check to pay him.

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,907
Scott: And when I got there, the power was out.

7
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,620
Scott: This makes it very difficult for a computer programmer to do any work.

8
00:00:49,562 --> 00:00:57,120
Scott: And it just really sucked, especially driving there on this windy, middle-of-the-woods road with sticks falling out of the sky, hitting my car.

9
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,380
Rym: Well, that was due to the fact that we had a freakish kind of weather pattern storm going on here.

10
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,599
Scott: Yeah, it was just like in crazy rain and crazy wind, and that was it.

11
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:15,980
Rym: I mean, despite the fact that we live in New York State, and that we live in an area that's generally very cold in the winter, it's been 50, 60 degrees, sunny, rainy, thunderstorms.

12
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:26,720
Scott: There was so much rain, I almost, like, pulled over the car a couple times, because I just couldn't see, even with my wipers going as fast as they go.

13
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:33,337
Scott: But it just generally sucked, and I ended up just coming home at one and being like, "Screw this.

14
00:01:33,357 --> 00:01:33,558
Scott: Screw

15
00:01:33,578 --> 00:01:33,678
Scott: it.".

16
00:01:34,421 --> 00:01:42,200
Rym: Now, interestingly enough, today, when I got home from work, I, you know, did the usual "I'm home, lift some weights," whatever, and then I go take a shower.

17
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:45,973
Rym: And as I'm taking my shower, power goes out.

18
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:47,340
Scott: Damn it.

19
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:57,079
Scott: Yeah, I drove up to the house from the train station today, and I noticed the entire block, the street lights aren't on, and all the houses are dark, and I'm like, "Power's out, isn't

20
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:57,159
Scott: it?".

21
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,535
Scott: And I see this truck at the end of the street, and I'm like,

22
00:01:59,716 --> 00:01:59,918
Scott: "Fuck.".

23
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:13,220
Rym: Yeah, see, the thing is, they were working on something when I came home, up the street, and then while I was in the shower, they moved the truck to another spot, like one step down before our house, and they cut the power off, and then they went back over to where they were working.

24
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,580
Scott: How did you see them do that if you were in the shower?

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,791
Rym: 'Cause when I got home, they were at the end of the street working.

26
00:02:18,273 --> 00:02:19,920
Rym: I go into the shower, and the power goes out.

27
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,480
Rym: So I get up, and I remember I saw guys working, so I look out the window, and now they're at the other end of the side.

28
00:02:25,983 --> 00:02:27,579
Rym: And they're up in the cherry picker messing with it.

29
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,660
Rym: And then they go back to the first spot again and start working.

30
00:02:32,122 --> 00:02:33,153
Rym: And I sat there thinking,

31
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:33,375
Rym: "Crap.".

32
00:02:35,501 --> 00:02:38,800
Rym: Like twice, I sat down by my computer to try and do something and realized I couldn't.

33
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:40,875
Scott: Yeah, that happens all the time.

34
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,837
Scott: Like, especially when, like, the internet will be down, but the power will be on, and you'll sit at the computer and be like, "Yeah, I'm just gonna check my

35
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:48,118
Scott: fuck.".

36
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:49,449
Scott: "I'm just gonna visit/the

37
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:49,651
Scott: fuck.".

38
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,733
Rym: Fine, I'll just play Counter-Strike.

39
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:52,319
Scott: God damn it.

40
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,720
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

41
00:02:55,661 --> 00:02:59,280
Rym: So we got an email from an Eric G. of Newton, Kansas.

42
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,920
Scott: This is apparently the guy who was listening to the show with his PSP.

43
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,100
Rym: Yep, well he's one of actually three people who listen to the show on their PSPs now.

44
00:03:08,282 --> 00:03:09,839
Scott: Two more people started doing it?

45
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,428
Rym: Yeah, he's better.

46
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:11,120
Rym: He's two more.

47
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:23,100
Rym: Now, basically he explained that the way he uses it is that apparently the 2.6 firmware update of the PSP, despite the fact that it breaks, you know, all your emulators and those hacks...

48
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,000
Scott: Actually, I heard that, like, now that they can get everything working.

49
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,860
Rym: Oh yeah, but if you had the old style ones, you gotta redo it all.

50
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:30,267
Scott: Oh, I guess.

51
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:30,931
Scott: I don't know.

52
00:03:30,972 --> 00:03:37,660
Scott: I don't know the details, but... I know that the real-life guy has every emulator with ROMs for all of them, for every console, working.

53
00:03:39,142 --> 00:03:47,360
Rym: And basically, anyway, this firmware adds a web browser that has RSS capabilities, so you can subscribe to basically any podcast or any RSS, trivially.

54
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,540
Scott: See, that's what the iPod really needs, is iTunes in the iPod.

55
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,880
Scott: So while I'm... without plugging it into a computer, I can download new podcasts on my iPod.

56
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:04,999
Scott: That's... you know, the PSP is still too big to be... even though it can do this, it's still too big with the, you know, this extra stuff on it.

57
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:13,956
Scott: But if you made the iPod a little bigger and threw in, like, a little wireless card or something, maybe like a Nano with a wireless card attached, that would be the shit.

58
00:04:14,257 --> 00:04:14,900
Scott: That would be awesome.

59
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,418
Rym: Now, he also asked us how the hell we knew he was using the PSP.

60
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:23,580
Rym: And basically we have two mechanisms for knowing exactly who's listening to this show.

61
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:31,500
Rym: One, if you visit our site with a web browser and download the MP3, your web browser has a thing in it called a user agent string.

62
00:04:32,461 --> 00:04:35,360
Rym: And it basically tells us exactly what web browser you're using.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,965
Rym: Of course, you might change it.

64
00:04:37,005 --> 00:04:40,160
Rym: Some people just put funny stuff in there, or they pretend to be IE or whatever.

65
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:44,520
Rym: But we generally know about how many Firefox and Opera and IE users visit the site.

66
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,003
Scott: And we know all sorts of things.

67
00:04:46,043 --> 00:04:53,146
Scott: Like, if you're visiting, like, Slashdot, and then you click on a link on Slashdot that takes you to our site, I see.

68
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,640
Scott: Hey, one person from Slashdot came over to our site.

69
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,940
Scott: And there's all kinds of stuff that, you know, you can use to figure out who's doing what on your website.

70
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:08,198
Scott: It's never exact, but as the number of users you get increase, it's usually about 90% correct.

71
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,060
Scott: So the amount of effect the error has doesn't, you know, mess with the stats so much.

72
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,080
Rym: Well, that was an interesting way of explaining statistics.

73
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:18,656
Scott: Yeah.

74
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:30,620
Rym: Basically, to sum that up, the more visitors you have, while the individual data are usually inaccurate or useless, in aggregate, the data is actually very useful because statistically all the outliers get eliminated.

75
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:33,620
Scott: But if you have, like, three visitors, it's pretty much useless.

76
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:41,260
Rym: Now, if you subscribe to the RSS, we have a normal feed for the site, but we also have the podcast feed, and that's what iTunes looks at.

77
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:51,320
Rym: And we use FeedBurner to do that just because FeedBurner adds all that iTunes-specific BS that you need to get popular on iTunes.

78
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:58,760
Rym: And we weren't going to modify our own site to do it, so we basically burn our feed through FeedBurner and then back and then out to you.

79
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:07,620
Rym: And in addition to doing all that, it gives us a bunch of statistics, like, it tells us all the different clients that access the feed and what they use and how often they hit it.

80
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,419
Rym: We know exactly how many Windows users versus Mac users are subscribed to the RSS.

81
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,680
Rym: And, yeah, there are three of you out there using the PSP, so kudos to Eric for actually answering our question to you other two bastards.

82
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,692
Rym: Well, uh...

83
00:06:23,461 --> 00:06:23,681
Scott: Yep.

84
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:30,640
Scott: I don't think they were listening before, because I remember when we checked the first time, they were only one person with a PSP.

85
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:31,496
Rym: Yeah.

86
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,620
Rym: Though Eric seems like a cool guy, he's into robotics and all the stuff that we were into in high school.

87
00:06:37,082 --> 00:06:37,302
Scott: Yep.

88
00:06:37,543 --> 00:06:40,814
Scott: Little 16-year-old high school kid from Kansas seems pretty cool.

89
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:42,620
Scott: Keep listening.

90
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:49,556
Scott: And, uh, to the rest of you, send cool emails and we will also, uh, respond to them on the show in kind.

91
00:06:50,057 --> 00:06:51,100
Scott: Unless they suck at emails.

92
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,473
Rym: Nah, I think if an email sucks, we'll be more likely to respond to it.

93
00:06:54,513 --> 00:06:55,860
Rym: You just might not like our response.

94
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:02,060
Scott: Well, quite possibly, but, yeah, this is encouragement to, uh, be more like Eric here.

95
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:08,800
Rym: 'Cause actually, he offered to show us a lot about how the PSP works, 'cause we're not that familiar with him.

96
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,160
Rym: So we might get some audio feedback from him in the future, maybe a little, uh, bit or something.

97
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,129
Scott: Yeah, remember, you can always call the, uh, voicemail.

98
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,132
Scott: Do you mean 206-333-1537?

99
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:27,160
Rym: Yeah, see, the secret there is that we actually paused the recording and edited out the part where we fumbled around and looked for the number.

100
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:28,265
Scott: I had it.

101
00:07:28,325 --> 00:07:29,151
Scott: I didn't have to fumble.

102
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:30,139
Scott: I just, um...

103
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,260
Rym: You had to fumble a little bit.

104
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,497
Scott: I had it right away, but I didn't know if it was the right one.

105
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:35,303
Rym: Ha.

106
00:07:35,323 --> 00:07:42,780
Rym: Yeah, well, 'cause you had a problem before where you told everyone it wasn't actually the number to call, it was the number of that other audio feedback we got that we haven't played yet.

107
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,120
Scott: Yeah, but that's alright, but... Yeah.

108
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:58,840
Scott: You can either call that number and leave a message or just record your own MP3 or whatever and then email it to, uh, geekknights@gmail.com or put it on your website and then send us a link at geekknights@gmail.com or whatever.

109
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,472
Rym: Yeah, we're working on setting up Skype to where if we really want to talk to someone, we'll just do a quick audio conference.

110
00:08:03,572 --> 00:08:06,760
Rym: We're fine-tuning the details of that, but more to come.

111
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,419
Scott: Yeah, I think we'll need a new computer before we can do that.

112
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:09,980
Scott: Yeah.

113
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:17,520
Rym: Though in my ever-present quest for a new computer, I accidentally shredded the credit card I was gonna use to buy the computer.

114
00:08:18,528 --> 00:08:18,718
Scott: Awesome.

115
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:31,520
Rym: Well, I was getting rid of old pieces of paper and old, just old, uh, documents, and I was cutting them up, and I saw what I thought was an empty envelope, and I went snip, and I met resistance, and I looked inside to find my old credit card cut in half.

116
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,285
Scott: Hm?

117
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,091
Rym: Luckily, I called and I told the credit card company what happened, and they laughed and they mailed me a new one.

118
00:08:37,613 --> 00:08:40,140
Rym: So I'm probably gonna order a new PC as soon as that thing arrives.

119
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,424
Scott: That's not the story you told me.

120
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:44,340
Scott: You told me, like, you lost the credit card, or you don't know what happened to it.

121
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,423
Rym: No, I know what happened to it.

122
00:08:45,463 --> 00:08:48,933
Rym: Well, what it was is I didn't want to use it back when I was, you know, poor and in debt.

123
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:51,240
Rym: I had two credit cards, keep in mind, in college.

124
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,526
Rym: And because I was poor, I maxed them both out, paying for things like food.

125
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:59,817
Rym: One of them I lost, which was fine because I, uh, never paid that one back.

126
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:00,940
Rym: That's a long story.

127
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:07,540
Rym: And maybe we'll do one someday on how you can have awesome credit no matter what you do, because the system's kinda broken.

128
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:18,199
Rym: The other one I kept, but it was also maxed out and useless, but that one I paid back down to zero, and I just didn't use it for two years after that, and I finally wanted to use it again, and, uh...

129
00:09:20,146 --> 00:09:20,420
Scott: Alright.

130
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:28,800
Rym: So in the news, Google, our wonderful friend, gave the giant finger to the federal government, and I am very pleased with this.

131
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:40,958
Scott: Yup, it shows that even, no matter how much we think Google's becoming big and evil, it's still, to this day, not yet, even though it's definitely still the status of impending doom.

132
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,420
Scott: It is not yet doom.

133
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,040
Rym: Yup.

134
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,900
Scott: So rest easily tonight, at least.

135
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,523
Rym: I mean, basically what this is, is back.

136
00:09:48,563 --> 00:10:04,800
Rym: a while ago, the Bush administration tried to push through this, uh, Internet Child Protection Act, and, among other things, its main thing was that it makes it illegal to provide pornographic content anywhere on the internet, without controls in place to make sure minors don't access it.

137
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,620
Scott: What if my website is hosted in, you know, Kajikistan?

138
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:16,880
Rym: Oh, or, you know, what if your definition of pornography differs from someone else's, or you just happen to have naked pictures of yourself on a website?

139
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,560
Scott: Yeah, Flickr has people put up naked pictures.

140
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:25,520
Rym: Plus, considering that there's almost no way to verify someone's age online, I mean, really, no way.

141
00:10:25,844 --> 00:10:26,300
Scott: Not at all.

142
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:32,679
Rym: This law is just bullshit, and the Supreme Court's thought the same, and they voted almost unanimously to get rid of this law two years ago.

143
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:33,245
Scott: Mhm.

144
00:10:34,182 --> 00:10:35,499
Rym: And, Bush is trying to bring it back.

145
00:10:36,147 --> 00:10:36,480
Rym: Good job.

146
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:51,320
Rym: And, in order to do so, they've got a task force, and a federal judge requested Google to send them basically every single search that was made on Google over an entire week, so that they could assess how much porn is accessible on the internet.

147
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:52,403
Scott: Wow.

148
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:53,898
Rym: Yeah.

149
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:02,578
Rym: Uh, Google said, and I think it's very succinct and to the point, "Google is not a party to this lawsuit, and the demand for the information is

150
00:11:02,638 --> 00:11:03,159
Rym: overreaching.".

151
00:11:04,641 --> 00:11:08,234
Rym: And, they went on to say that they will fight the government's effort

152
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:09,077
Rym: "vigorously.".

153
00:11:10,621 --> 00:11:15,100
Scott: So, the "do no evil" motto still holding up?

154
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,300
Rym: Yeah, because it really wouldn't have hurt them to hand the data over.

155
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,760
Rym: I'm sure they could fairly easily, but I'm glad that they're standing up for my right to search for porn.

156
00:11:24,281 --> 00:11:28,080
Scott: Yup, because God knows porn is so hard to find, you need Google to help.

157
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:49,950
Rym: Alright, so, in the spirit of having things of the day that tick me off a lot more than they entertain you, I got another little bit of Randy that I don't know if you're all familiar with, but you might find entertaining and/or scary.

158
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:59,150
Rym: Now, I'm linking to the Wikipedia article involving it, because I've actually been involved in heavily editing this article for a number of weeks.

159
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:09,870
Rym: And, crackpots seem to keep un-editing it, and it's poorly written to begin with for a number of reasons, so I assure you that the grammar and spelling are not mine.

160
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:16,190
Rym: I've mostly added the words "supposedly" and "allegedly" and "so they claim" to this thing, more than anything else.

161
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:25,448
Rym: But, basically, there are a couple of crackpots, Lee Carroll and Jan Tober, who came up with the idea of "Indigo

162
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:25,989
Rym: children."

163
00:12:26,511 --> 00:12:29,482
Rym: Does that mean children with, like, skin?

164
00:12:29,603 --> 00:12:31,510
Scott: that is, like, one of the colors of the rainbow?

165
00:12:32,071 --> 00:12:33,750
Rym: Oh, oh, see, that would be sane.

166
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:41,670
Rym: It turns out that, well, first of all, according to these two, well, I'll go with Lee, because he's the one who's really the advocate of this.

167
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:52,330
Rym: These are magic special children who were born starting in the year 1982, but with increasing frequency, a-peaking around 1994.

168
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,483
Rym: And they're called "Indigo children" because they have a "Indigo-hued

169
00:12:55,784 --> 00:12:56,166
Rym: aura.".

170
00:12:57,933 --> 00:12:58,750
Rym: Yeah, aura.

171
00:12:59,072 --> 00:12:59,725
Scott: I was born in '82.

172
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:01,148
Rym: Yeah, so was I.

173
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,049
Scott: Do I have an aura that's indigo?

174
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:08,470
Rym: I don't know, I'm looking, and, uh, your aura kinda looks like, uh, pseudoscience to me.

175
00:13:09,294 --> 00:13:12,290
Scott: I look at you, and where the aura should be, I see air.

176
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,670
Rym: Ah, ah, yeah, I guess we're not indigo children.

177
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:17,690
Scott: Actually, I don't even see the air, I see the wall.

178
00:13:18,753 --> 00:13:19,164
Scott: What does that mean?

179
00:13:20,914 --> 00:13:21,930
Rym: Uh, it might mean you're smart.

180
00:13:22,532 --> 00:13:22,575
Scott: Oh.

181
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,990
Rym: Yeah, now, basically, this is, this is really kinda scary.

182
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:34,990
Rym: The more you might look into this, I recommend you read the article if you don't believe that there are a lot of stupid people out there in the world who are trying to destroy everything good and knowledgeable.

183
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:49,910
Rym: But, basically, these people believe that these children, who were born in this time period, are magic and special, and are either aliens, or a hybrid alien, or maybe they're messiahs, but the basic thing is that they're gifted.

184
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,710
Rym: They come into this world, and they're here to save us from all evil and usher in a new era.

185
00:13:55,571 --> 00:14:00,768
Rym: But, in actuality, they're most likely just normal kids with possibly ADHD.

186
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:12,350
Rym: And this is just a system that allows parents who have a troubled child to believe that that child is somehow gifted or special, when, in fact, that child just needs professional help.

187
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,629
Scott: Oh, that's what this is about.

188
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:30,370
Rym: Yeah, so a parent will have a child who, you know, is maybe not the brightest kid, or they're having a lot of trouble in school, and instead of, you know, helping the kid learn, they'll decide that the child is an indigo child, and that they're actually a genius, they're just misunderstood.

189
00:14:31,011 --> 00:14:40,910
Rym: And that to send them to a normal school would be a crime, and thus they send them to these special schools, and it's a lot like Xavier's School for the Gifted if mutants didn't exist.

190
00:14:42,592 --> 00:14:42,655
Scott: Uh...

191
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:52,130
Rym: Yeah, these are some crazy nutjobs, and I guess the scary part about this is that there are tens and hundreds of thousands of people around the world who believe in this.

192
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,130
Rym: There are actual scientists who, for some reason, think this is legitimate.

193
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:57,630
Rym: Really?

194
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:08,950
Rym: I guess they're not really scientists, they're just crackpots, but look around, look at this Wikipedia, follow some of those links, and that's all I gotta say about this, 'cause I'll just get angry and go on a rant if I keep going.

195
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,892
Scott: Well, you know what?

196
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:23,050
Scott: Even if this indigo thing was true, I think it's pretty obvious that the parents are a little special, and they should go to a special school.

197
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:30,383
Scott: So again, my thing of the day is not something, uh, you know, it's something fun and normal.

198
00:15:30,944 --> 00:15:33,690
Scott: Well, not so normal, but it's fun and happy.

199
00:15:34,751 --> 00:15:38,090
Scott: So, there are lots of generators for various things all over the internet.

200
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,053
Rym: Haha!

201
00:15:39,335 --> 00:15:41,910
Rym: I'm generating a picture of the haha guy saying something!

202
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:42,410
Scott: Yeah.

203
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:48,836
Scott: Well, I found one recently that allows you to generate a character in The Simpsons style.

204
00:15:48,936 --> 00:16:03,490
Scott: You can select a head, an eyeball, a nose, a hair, a body, glasses, extras, which is really just facial hair or facial lipstick or something, and you can change the scene.

205
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:12,150
Rym: Now, when Scott showed this to me, the first thing I did when I looked at it was I took a very feminine head and matched it up with the ugliest man body I could find.

206
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:20,650
Rym: And then when we got home, I discovered that Scott had taken the manliest head and matched it up with the most feminine body he could find, and I found that amusing.

207
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,257
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty much the first thing anyone's gonna do with it.

208
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:29,770
Scott: There's not much you can, uh, you know, that's the funnest thing you can do with it anyways.

209
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,655
Scott: But, uh, you can do all sorts of other cool things.

210
00:16:32,675 --> 00:16:35,742
Scott: You can try to make a Simpsons, like, what would you look like if you were a Simpson?

211
00:16:35,782 --> 00:16:36,724
Scott: You could go for that.

212
00:16:37,525 --> 00:16:37,786
Scott: You know.

213
00:16:38,828 --> 00:16:39,550
Scott: It's a lot of fun.

214
00:16:40,472 --> 00:16:40,613
Rym: Huh?

215
00:16:41,197 --> 00:16:42,870
Rym: It's not, uh, can you make an indigo child?

216
00:16:44,038 --> 00:16:44,470
Scott: Uh, no.

217
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:50,863
Rym: So, it being Thursday, we're continuing with part two of our ongoing series on how to attend conventions.

218
00:16:52,005 --> 00:16:53,790
Rym: Anime cons, gaming cons, what have you.

219
00:16:54,871 --> 00:17:01,690
Rym: And, uh, last week we talked mostly about, you know, the planning stages, actually driving there, deciding if you want to go, all that sort of thing.

220
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,521
Scott: The stuff you do before the actual con.

221
00:17:04,165 --> 00:17:04,930
Rym: The pre-con.

222
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,278
Rym: So now, now we're hitting up on at-con.

223
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:10,450
Rym: What do you actually do from the moment you arrive until the moment you depart?

224
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:14,189
Scott: I don't know how far we'll actually make it, but we'll go until time runs out.

225
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:14,970
Rym: Yep.

226
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,336
Rym: 'Cause the first thing is you'll arrive into town.

227
00:17:17,376 --> 00:17:22,869
Rym: however you arrived, and depending on if you drove or flew or took a train, you'll have to deal with various different obstacles.

228
00:17:23,771 --> 00:17:30,090
Scott: Yeah, if you took a train or a plane, you gotta get to your hotel somehow, and if you have a friend, that's real easy.

229
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:37,730
Scott: If you don't have a friend that's, you know, already there with a car, you're gonna need to take a taxi, maybe a light rail, something.

230
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:44,190
Scott: But, uh, you better figure it out and make haste with it, or you could be sitting at the airport slash train station for quite a while.

231
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:49,690
Rym: Luckily, most airport train stations have very good taxi services to all surrounding hotels.

232
00:17:49,811 --> 00:17:51,689
Scott: Yep, you just say, "Take me to this hotel," and you go.

233
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:57,123
Rym: Though if you're driving in, it's not a concern unless you go to the super, super big conventions.

234
00:17:57,183 --> 00:17:59,530
Rym: Most cons are just free parking or you park at the hotel, whatever.

235
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,538
Rym: But if you go to Otakon, we'll use Otakon as the example.

236
00:18:03,578 --> 00:18:08,270
Rym: just because it's the big, big, big con we go to, parking is hellishly expensive.

237
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:12,826
Rym: As in, the hotel parking at the hotel we stay at is $20 a night.

238
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:21,250
Scott: So if you get there, uh, let's say Thursday morning, it's Thursday night, Friday night, Saturday night, 60 bucks.

239
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:22,950
Scott: Yeah, of course.

240
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:32,290
Scott: That's not, you know, that's not super expensive, I mean, we can afford it, but a lot of poor geeks can't, and it's, you can buy a video game, man, and have change left over.

241
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:41,250
Rym: I mean, I guess the moral of this story is just, know how much parking is gonna cost and leave that money aside, because we barely made it out of our first Otakon.

242
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:41,877
Rym: Yeah.

243
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,930
Rym: They're scrapping together what little money we had left to buy gas to pay for parking.

244
00:18:47,115 --> 00:18:47,770
Scott: It's kinda rough.

245
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:57,030
Rym: Of course, this most recent year, we actually got away almost scot-free entirely by accident, because we, uh, lost the little slip of paper that said how long we were in the garage.

246
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,630
Scott: I don't think we actually lost it, but it was lost in the car.

247
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:00,990
Rym: Yeah, I couldn't find it, to this day.

248
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:05,564
Scott: And when we drove up, you know, he, we, uh, we said we lost our slip of paper, he said, "Well, how long have you been parked

249
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:05,704
Scott: here?".

250
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:06,687
Scott: We said, "You know, a

251
00:19:06,727 --> 00:19:06,908
Scott: night.".

252
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:08,142
Rym: *laughs*.

253
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:15,830
Rym: Actually, I don't think the guy who was asking, either he, he just wanted a bribe, and then he let us out, or he didn't speak English.

254
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:19,349
Rym: We're not sure, but we gave him twenty bucks and he let us go.

255
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:23,370
Scott: Yeah, so we ended up saving a whole lot of money by, uh, luck.

256
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:24,227
Scott: Yeah.

257
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,330
Scott: And now we're gonna do it on purpose.

258
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:31,850
Rym: Yeah, so, uh, I guess after this coming Otakon, we'll be able to tell you whether or not you can get away with paying almost nothing for parking.

259
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:32,371
Scott: Yep.

260
00:19:32,391 --> 00:19:39,070
Scott: 'Cause we'll definitely, you know, be willing to pay the full price if they catch us, and they don't let us get off with that trick, but it might work.

261
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:48,930
Rym: Now, actually arriving, the first thing you wanna do, no matter what, I don't care whether you're registering or what, go to the hotel and check in first, even if your check-in time isn't until later in the day.

262
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,170
Scott: Usually you can get checked in as soon as the hotel is your room ready.

263
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:58,430
Scott: The check-in time, the hotel officially states, is the time when all the rooms are ready for getting in no matter what.

264
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:03,970
Scott: So, depending on where your room is in the hotel, it's pretty much a crapshoot whether you can get in early or not.

265
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,353
Rym: Also, how early you arrive.

266
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:13,770
Rym: Like, we go to Otakon, we arrive Thursday morning, so we check in at, like, 11 AM, and they usually have some rooms ready and they just give them to us right away.

267
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:14,199
Scott: Yep.

268
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:20,170
Rym: And the earlier you check in, the more likely you'll be able to choose where your rooms are in the hotel if you have a preference or anything like that.

269
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,910
Scott: Yeah, if they didn't already decide that when you made your reservation.

270
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:27,250
Rym: And they'll also likely have more, uh, spare keys available if you need more than a few.

271
00:20:28,012 --> 00:20:32,990
Scott: Yeah, because it's not like the olden days where there were so many physical keys per room, now they're keycards that they program.

272
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:43,749
Scott: So, they have a stack of spare ones, and, you know, if you ask for two extra, they take two spare ones and they program them for your room, and eventually they run out of those, so...

273
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:51,290
Rym: Now, I highly recommend, if you can, that you ask for early check-in when you reserve the hotel room.

274
00:20:52,071 --> 00:20:59,450
Rym: Because most hotels offer it free of charge, even if they don't say they do, and all that means is they'll make sure your room's ready long before the check-in time.

275
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:07,710
Scott: That means you can dump off all your stuff in your hotel room real early in the morning when you show up, and then go do stuff!

276
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:17,870
Rym: But now, talking about the hotel room, I promised last week that I'd give a nice succinct guide on how to overstuff a hotel room, because it's technically illegal and against the hotel's policies.

277
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:21,856
Scott: But overstuffing is pretty much absolutely necessary for a convention.

278
00:21:21,957 --> 00:21:30,050
Scott: If you pay for the actual number of rooms it would take to legally house, you know, like 20 people, you have to be like a rich guy.

279
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,440
Rym: Well, actually, only if you're going to a big con like Otakon.

280
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:36,030
Rym: Otakon and Katsucon have the most expensive hotel rooms.

281
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:40,490
Rym: But like, OhioCon, it was like 90 bucks a night for the room, it didn't matter.

282
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,877
Scott: You know, but still, 90 bucks, you know, it adds up.

283
00:21:43,897 --> 00:21:48,808
Scott: Even if it was 90 bucks a night, I'd rather have six people in the room than the limit of four.

284
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:59,810
Rym: See, I used to feel that way, but when I went to Katsucon, even though the hotel room was expensive, I'd gone to so many cons where I overstuffed the room, it was real nice to share a room with just two other guys.

285
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:00,417
Scott: Oh, yeah.

286
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:02,955
Rym: I paid out the ass for it.

287
00:22:04,137 --> 00:22:09,910
Rym: But basically, there's a list of things and tricks that you have to do, because the hotel knows you're overstuffing.

288
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:14,357
Rym: Don't think for a second that they don't know exactly what you're planning, especially if you're at a con.

289
00:22:14,858 --> 00:22:21,490
Rym: The thing is, they won't screw you, and they won't go out of their way to find you out, unless you really give them a hard time.

290
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,633
Rym: So, it's kind of an open secret.

291
00:22:25,475 --> 00:22:33,770
Rym: The rule number one, everyone must bring their own towels, because if you get a room that has an occupancy of four people, it's gonna have four towels in it.

292
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:38,290
Rym: If you request, you know, eight more towels, they're gonna be suspicious.

293
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:49,670
Scott: The other thing is, the towels they give you are really small, so even if you try to use them, someone who's normal size, like what, we're almost six feet tall, I had to use two of those hotel towels.

294
00:22:49,811 --> 00:22:51,750
Rym: That's just because you use a giant freak towel.

295
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,070
Scott: A giant awesome towel.

296
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:54,869
Scott: Bring your own towel.

297
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:59,710
Rym: Yeah, bring your own towel, and if you have extra people, bring your own pillows, blankets, all the extras.

298
00:23:00,832 --> 00:23:03,590
Rym: All the stuff that you might need that you would otherwise ask for the hotel.

299
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,070
Scott: The awesome people get dibs on beds.

300
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:13,690
Rym: Generally, that's the one perk, because we've been talking about how difficult it is, and time consuming, and frustrating to actually manage this for all your friends.

301
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:19,525
Rym: The main perk is that if you do all this, you're pretty much guaranteed a bed, because you did it.

302
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:21,590
Rym: You can just kick people out of your room if they don't comply.

303
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:22,170
Rym: Yup.

304
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:28,870
Rym: Now, rule number two, do not ever request anything extra from the hotel.

305
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:33,330
Scott: You don't want room service, you don't even want the rollaway bed, you want nothing.

306
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,430
Rym: Yeah, especially never ask for the rollaway bed.

307
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,049
Scott: They often charge for the rollaway bed.

308
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:44,050
Rym: Yes, and if you ask for the rollaway bed, they'll come into your room and they might see, you know, ten sets of bags where there should only be four.

309
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:49,630
Scott: The other thing is, normally when you go on vacation, your hotel room is full of, like, your clothes and your toiletries.

310
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:55,550
Scott: So you can let room service, you know, not room service, that's ordering food, uh, housekeeping, come in and clean up all you want.

311
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:06,330
Scott: But at a con, your room is full of, like, drinks, snacks, toys, con goodies, extra people, con badges, all kinds of crazy shit.

312
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:10,790
Scott: And it's just a mess everywhere, and you really don't want housekeeping touching anything.

313
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:19,830
Rym: So that's rule number three, do not ever request housekeeping, and make sure you put the Do Not Disturb thing on your doorknob 24/7.

314
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,309
Scott: Yup, never let it get off there.

315
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:26,650
Scott: And if there isn't a Do Not Disturb thingy in your room, go ask for one at the desk.

316
00:24:27,073 --> 00:24:28,029
Rym: Or make one.

317
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,119
Scott: Yeah, don't call them up and say, "Bring me one,".

318
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:33,547
Scott: go down to the desk and say, "Can I have a Do Not Disturb

319
00:24:33,587 --> 00:24:33,788
Scott: sign?".

320
00:24:34,732 --> 00:24:36,129
Scott: That way, they don't come in your room and look.

321
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:37,070
Rym: Yup.

322
00:24:37,692 --> 00:24:43,430
Rym: Now, rule number three is don't have everyone go up to the desk when you check in.

323
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:52,150
Rym: If you walk up to a desk with nine people, and you say, "Checking into room for Decoster, Occupancy 2," they're gonna know.

324
00:24:53,051 --> 00:25:01,370
Rym: Have one guy go check in, and then meet everyone at the room, or go up to the room in stages, or something, you're smart, figure it out.

325
00:25:02,111 --> 00:25:08,230
Scott: Generally, it doesn't matter unless you travel in a big group, because people show up at all kinds of different times.

326
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,981
Scott: So those people just show up and be like, "Hey, what room are you

327
00:25:11,021 --> 00:25:11,101
Scott: in?".

328
00:25:11,122 --> 00:25:12,830
Scott: And they go in the elevator and no one knows.

329
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:15,790
Scott: And maybe one person shows up at a time, maybe two at a time.

330
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,309
Scott: But if you show up at ten people at a time, you have to buffer it.

331
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:24,190
Scott: You know, stay in the parking garage and then go up into the elevators.

332
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:29,290
Scott: Or just send one person up to get the keys, then have that person come down and get everyone else.

333
00:25:29,812 --> 00:25:30,996
Rym: Yep, now getting the keys.

334
00:25:31,658 --> 00:25:34,910
Rym: Don't ask for more keys than the room's occupancy.

335
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:40,890
Rym: So if you have a room with an occupancy of four, you can safely ask for three extra keys, but don't ask for eight.

336
00:25:41,954 --> 00:25:43,230
Rym: It's kind of obvious why you should--.

337
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,610
Scott: Usually the hotels will give you two keys by default.

338
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:45,925
Scott: Yeah.

339
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,109
Scott: And two might be all you need.

340
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,390
Rym: It's always good to have extras, but you gotta make sure you keep track of them.

341
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:53,873
Scott: Oh, I forgot.

342
00:25:53,913 --> 00:26:01,670
Scott: We're assuming that you're getting normal rooms with two double beds, which is two queen-sized beds, which is for four people.

343
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:02,091
Rym: Yes.

344
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:09,310
Rym: In fact, you should probably request that, because usually it's interchangeable between two double beds or two queen-- Usually it's two queen beds or one king bed.

345
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:09,710
Rym: Yeah.

346
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:10,308
Rym: Are your choices.

347
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:17,150
Scott: You want two queen bedrooms, and you want as many adjacent rooms as you're gonna need.

348
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:29,130
Rym: Yeah, most people only get one room, but if you're like us and you start making awesome and all your friends start wanting to stay with you, we get two, three rooms, and with the early check-in, we're assured that we'll get three rooms in a row.

349
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,757
Rym: Because, basically, think of it this way.

350
00:26:32,098 --> 00:26:34,930
Rym: Shower space is pretty much the only reason for this, and also keys.

351
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:41,250
Rym: If you have eight people in one room, that's eight people who share one bathroom and one shower and four keys.

352
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:50,550
Rym: If you have sixteen people in two rooms, and the rooms are adjacent, now you have two bathrooms that can be used simultaneously between the two rooms.

353
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:57,687
Scott: Because you leave the doors that connect the rooms together open at all times, so any key to one room is a key to both of the rooms.

354
00:26:58,529 --> 00:26:58,790
Scott: You see?

355
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:03,521
Rym: So if you ever go in a big group, unless you're going for a suite or something, just get rooms that are adjacent.

356
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:06,990
Rym: You'll save money, and it'll make your overstuffing experience a lot better.

357
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,955
Scott: Yeah, a suite is something completely different.

358
00:27:09,035 --> 00:27:11,763
Scott: I can only recommend you get a suite if you're going to have a party.

359
00:27:12,906 --> 00:27:14,610
Scott: Otherwise, it's just kind of silly.

360
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:15,170
Rym: Yeah.

361
00:27:15,531 --> 00:27:24,150
Rym: Now, my general recommendation is that you can probably take the occupancy of a room plus three people comfortably, unless it's like a Days Inn or something crappy.

362
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:30,570
Rym: Now, if you have adjacent rooms, you can add two extra people per adjacency, basically.

363
00:27:31,091 --> 00:27:33,035
Rym: Say you've got four occupancy rooms.

364
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,620
Rym: You could have seven people per room, fine.

365
00:27:35,961 --> 00:27:40,250
Rym: But if you've got the door between them open, you can fit a couple extra people in addition to that fairly easily.

366
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,653
Scott: It also depends on the kind of people you're bringing.

367
00:27:43,773 --> 00:27:55,650
Scott: If you're bringing, let's say you're bringing ten giant fat people, or you're bringing a bunch of high-maintenance teenage girls, you're going to need to lower your estimates a little bit on how many you can fit in there.

368
00:27:56,191 --> 00:27:56,452
Rym: Yeah.

369
00:27:57,154 --> 00:27:58,517
Rym: Now, this is the rule.

370
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:01,063
Rym: We're beyond the rules that'll prevent you from getting caught.

371
00:28:01,444 --> 00:28:03,670
Rym: Here's the rule that you really need to remember.

372
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:09,500
Rym: Now, I recommend, first off, don't worry about other people following this rule.

373
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:14,870
Rym: Follow it yourself, even if you're not running the room, if you're just in it, and then worry about other people.

374
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:16,572
Rym: But keep your shit together.

375
00:28:17,473 --> 00:28:30,410
Rym: I mean, when you get into the room, pick a small area, put all your bags there, and state to the world that that is your spot, and make sure everything you own in the world that is at this convention with you is in that spot at all times when it is not on your person.

376
00:28:30,871 --> 00:28:31,652
Scott: Yeah.

377
00:28:31,772 --> 00:28:35,057
Scott: You can't tell you how many times people run around, "Where's my con badge?

378
00:28:35,378 --> 00:28:37,000
Scott: Where's the piece of my costume?

379
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:39,084
Scott: Where's that plushie I bought?

380
00:28:39,524 --> 00:28:40,145
Rym: Where's this?

381
00:28:40,226 --> 00:28:40,806
Rym: Where's that?

382
00:28:40,847 --> 00:28:41,768
Scott: Where's my toothbrush?

383
00:28:41,828 --> 00:28:42,089
Scott: Oh my

384
00:28:42,129 --> 00:28:42,449
Scott: god!".

385
00:28:43,311 --> 00:28:48,450
Scott: Keep it all together in one spot, and just don't mess around with it, and you'll be okay.

386
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:49,010
Rym: Yep.

387
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:56,890
Rym: Now, your friends may suck and not do this, but as long as you do it, and you keep their stuff out of your stuff, it'll make your life a thousand times easier.

388
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:05,550
Scott: And then, 'cause if you're the guy who's got the room, then when everyone checks out, you go around the room and you pick everything up that looks good, and everything else, just leave there.

389
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:06,130
Scott: Yeah.

390
00:29:07,231 --> 00:29:20,766
Rym: I mean, you wouldn't believe the things that our friends leave in their rooms, 'cause we usually check out, like we walk out of the room last, and there's just stuff everywhere, like underwear, socks, shoes, bathing suits, towels, everyone forgets their toiletries.

391
00:29:21,047 --> 00:29:23,970
Rym: I think there were like five bottles of shampoo in one of our rooms last year.

392
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:24,595
Scott: Wow.

393
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,410
Scott: That was the most ever.

394
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,429
Rym: Yeah, like everyone left their shampoo.

395
00:29:29,691 --> 00:29:29,952
Scott: Yikes.

396
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,030
Scott: Alright, so I think that's about it for the hotel.

397
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:33,971
Rym: Yep.

398
00:29:34,612 --> 00:29:43,570
Rym: And we've already talked last time about, when you distribute the keys, make sure you distribute the keys in a way that lets the people who need to go to the room the most often go to it without bothering you.

399
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:54,063
Scott: Alright, so we already talked about registration, whether you should pre-register or register at the con, but the next thing you want to do is get your badge as soon as possible.

400
00:29:54,463 --> 00:29:58,790
Scott: Even if it's a little tiny con, the sooner you get the badge, the sooner you can have fun at the con.

401
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:02,235
Rym: Now if it's a little con, don't worry about it, just get in line and whatever.

402
00:30:02,255 --> 00:30:13,550
Rym: If it's a big con like Oticon, bring water, bring your DS or PSP, bring all your friends and stand in line together, and be prepared to wait.

403
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:22,302
Scott: Now, you want to check the weather, 'cause if you're gonna be outside, which is a pretty good chance you're gonna be waiting outside, there might be rain, you need an umbrella.

404
00:30:22,582 --> 00:30:24,505
Scott: It might be crazy, crazy hot.

405
00:30:24,885 --> 00:30:28,070
Scott: Don't wear your furry cosplay in the crazy, crazy heat.

406
00:30:28,311 --> 00:30:34,650
Rym: Yeah, in fact, don't cosplay until you've gotten the hotel room and you're in it and you have a chance to shower and relax a little.

407
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:38,950
Scott: It's okay to do like a light cosplay, like let's say you have a funny hat.

408
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:46,050
Rym: Yeah, or you got a Fullmetal Alchemist uniform that's actually real clothing and is comfortable, like you wore it in the car on the way there.

409
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:56,990
Scott: Yeah, but if you have the typical cosplay like, you know, I don't know, a Koopa Troopa with a giant turtle shell, you don't want to wait in line with the giant turtle shell on you.

410
00:30:57,271 --> 00:31:03,190
Rym: It'll suck ass and you won't look good because you'll be sweaty and miserable and frowning the whole time and no one will care about your cosplay.

411
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:08,482
Scott: There are enough cosplays in line and there's enough time to do cosplay the rest of the con.

412
00:31:09,003 --> 00:31:11,650
Scott: You don't need to wait outside for two hours in the cosplay.

413
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:19,530
Rym: Now also, regarding the cosplay, and as our friend Kat noted in the forums, if you're going to cosplay, make sure your cosplay is done before the con.

414
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:25,210
Scott: I can't tell you how many times I've seen sewing machines at cons, people working on costumes while they're there.

415
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:32,409
Rym: Now it's good to have a sewing machine if you're a cosplayer, because if your costume breaks, like right before the masquerade, Oh, then you can fix it, sure.

416
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:37,830
Rym: But if you're spending more than half your time at the con making a new costume, you've got issues.

417
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,916
Scott: I remember I saw in Artist Alley.

418
00:31:39,977 --> 00:31:42,670
Scott: once, people were selling like emergency cosplay repair kits.

419
00:31:42,874 --> 00:31:43,046
Scott: Yeah.

420
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:57,809
Scott: You might want to test your cosplay before the con to make sure it doesn't fall apart, you know, with, you know, it doesn't have to go through intense like brawling activity, but like run around in it and see if it falls apart, unless it's the kind that, you know, you know it can't.

421
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:58,290
Rym: Yep.

422
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:06,390
Rym: Now if it's a really, really complex cosplay that's not going to last long and you know that, don't wear it Friday morning when no one's in the con yet because they're all in line.

423
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:10,321
Rym: Wait until Friday night or Saturday afternoon when the most people are going to see it.

424
00:32:10,401 --> 00:32:11,685
Rym: Get the most bang for your buck.

425
00:32:11,906 --> 00:32:13,130
Rym: You worked hard on that costume.

426
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,619
Scott: And if it's a really, really good costume, you're not going to be moving much in it.

427
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:20,430
Scott: You're pretty much going to go into the biggest open space and stand there.

428
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,695
Rym: God, I never really cosplayed on purpose before.

429
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:32,629
Rym: Like I was on Fansview twice because I didn't shave and I was scruffly and I was wearing a tie and I was hot so I pulled my collar open and they took a picture of me that I was Kaji from Ava.

430
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,976
Rym: But other than that, we'd never cosplayed before in our lives.

431
00:32:36,698 --> 00:32:42,050
Rym: And this past year, we decided to get all our friends and dress up as the axe gang from Kung Fu Hustle.

432
00:32:43,331 --> 00:32:49,547
Rym: And let me tell you, cosplayers, I have a whole new load of respect for you people.

433
00:32:49,888 --> 00:32:50,650
Rym: How do you deal with it?

434
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,897
Scott: I mean, I'm trying to go do my con business, right?

435
00:32:54,338 --> 00:32:57,306
Scott: And I'm just wearing a costume for fun and then people just say, "Stop!

436
00:32:57,607 --> 00:32:58,008
Scott: I want to take a

437
00:32:58,028 --> 00:32:58,309
Scott: picture.".

438
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:10,590
Scott: And as soon as one person has the balls to actually ask you to stop, a hundred people who didn't have the balls will stop and try to take a picture of you and you'll end up standing there for minutes and minutes and minutes as people just keep taking pictures.

439
00:33:10,711 --> 00:33:13,040
Scott: And it's like, "Alright, I have stuff to do.

440
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:14,848
Scott: I'm actually a con attendee

441
00:33:14,888 --> 00:33:15,069
Scott: here.".

442
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:15,550
Rym: Yep.

443
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:25,770
Rym: You'll have to deal with, like, this may sound silly, but if you're an anime con especially, you're really going to have to deal with, like, prepubescent girls running up to you from behind and hugging you.

444
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:27,209
Scott: That's not cool.

445
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,232
Rym: Yeah.

446
00:33:28,493 --> 00:33:29,457
Rym: Just be wary.

447
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:32,890
Rym: There are going to be girls who are going to try to jump all over you if you're dressing up.

448
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:37,349
Scott: So you only want to dress up at times and you don't want to do anything else.

449
00:33:38,012 --> 00:33:41,810
Scott: Or if you have a costume that, you know, no one will really care about or bug you about.

450
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:46,730
Rym: Because we cosplayed for about half the day and then we couldn't deal with it anymore and we had to change out of our costumes.

451
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:50,310
Rym: We were glad they were popular, but we couldn't actually do anything at the con.

452
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:54,403
Scott: Yeah, so if you're like a normal Sailor Scout, whatever, just who cares?

453
00:33:54,504 --> 00:33:56,210
Scott: But this is a really good one.

454
00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:02,490
Scott: If you happen to be a really amazing Sailor Moon or something, then you might want to only do it when nothing else is happening.

455
00:34:03,311 --> 00:34:07,450
Rym: Now, regarding cosplay, and once again, all this cosplay stuff applies mostly to anime cons.

456
00:34:08,732 --> 00:34:09,818
Scott: No, you'd be surprised.

457
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:11,770
Scott: There's a lot of costuming at other cons.

458
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:19,690
Rym: Yeah, not to stereotype, but if you go to a gaming con, most of the people who cosplay are real scary.

459
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,129
Scott: Yup, that's for sure.

460
00:34:21,931 --> 00:34:25,870
Rym: But I guess if you've never been to an anime con, cosplay is much more accepted.

461
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:28,860
Rym: Not in most people, but a lot of people do it.

462
00:34:29,303 --> 00:34:30,650
Rym: I'd say at least half the people do it.

463
00:34:31,032 --> 00:34:34,389
Rym: And there's not that stigma, and it's not just fat old guys dressed like Sailor Bubba.

464
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:40,389
Scott: Yeah, like at comic conventions, there'll be cosplay, like people dressed up as superheroes, but it's only like a few freaks.

465
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:43,409
Scott: It's not like, you know, a thing that everyone does.

466
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:48,510
Scott: At anime cons, it's weird because if not half, then more than half of the people are doing it.

467
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,804
Rym: But a lot of people who do it are very normal, cool people.

468
00:34:50,864 --> 00:34:51,730
Rym: They're not creepy at all.

469
00:34:51,909 --> 00:35:02,750
Scott: Yeah, and it ranges from stuff like a guy with like a sword to like someone dressed up as a giant Pikachu, you know, or crazy, crazy stuff.

470
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:06,750
Rym: I mean, there are people who you could consider professional cosplayers out there.

471
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:07,850
Scott: Those are the scary people.

472
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:12,470
Rym: 'Cause I actually stayed in a room with a bunch of those types way back when I went to Anime Central.

473
00:35:13,451 --> 00:35:17,070
Rym: And we stayed in the Presidential Suite with like 20 people, and there was a crazy party.

474
00:35:17,831 --> 00:35:28,810
Rym: And all the girls who had the room were like super pro cosplayers, to the point that they made an entire intricate, beautiful costume from scratch Friday night so they could wear it Saturday.

475
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:30,489
Scott: Wow.

476
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:34,605
Rym: Yeah, so if you've never been to an anime con, check it out just to see the cosplays.

477
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:35,830
Rym: They're actually really impressive.

478
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:42,090
Scott: Alright, so the next thing you do, you've got your badge, you've got your con packet, what do you do?

479
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:46,416
Scott: Well, the first thing, I think I posted this on the forum, but I'll say it again here.

480
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:56,170
Scott: You look at the con schedule, and there are things in the con schedule that will be so awesome and so amazing that you cannot possibly miss them.

481
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,114
Scott: But there won't be so many of these things.

482
00:35:58,135 --> 00:35:59,559
Scott: There'll maybe be two or three.

483
00:36:00,942 --> 00:36:03,510
Scott: Guarantee to yourself that you will do those things no matter what.

484
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:05,890
Rym: And don't commit to anything else.

485
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,590
Scott: Don't commit to anything else at all.

486
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:11,329
Rym: We're not saying don't do anything else, but don't commit to it.

487
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:18,709
Rym: Agree with all your friends, "Alright, I'm going to this because it's going to be crazy, and I'm going to this because it's going to be crazy and you'll all meet and do

488
00:36:18,789 --> 00:36:18,829
Rym: it.".

489
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,269
Rym: But the rest of the time, just wander around and do whatever strikes your fancy or whatever happens.

490
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:28,789
Scott: I mean, if you try to open up the con schedule and say, "I'm going to do this, and then I'm going to do that, and then I'm going to do this, and then I'm going to do

491
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:28,949
Scott: that."

492
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,435
Scott: Alright, well you know what's going to happen?

493
00:36:30,836 --> 00:36:34,370
Scott: That's going to be cancelled, that's going to move to a different room and you'll get lost for a half hour.

494
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:37,409
Scott: You'll get caught in a sea of traffic going to that.

495
00:36:38,352 --> 00:36:41,630
Scott: You know, there'll be a cool thing you'll stop to look at on your way to that.

496
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:45,390
Scott: You know, who knows, your plan will be totally shot to hell, it doesn't work.

497
00:36:45,951 --> 00:36:46,669
Scott: Don't even bother.

498
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:54,869
Scott: Just, at any moment during the con, if you're not entertained enough, then you open up the schedule, you say, "What's going on right

499
00:36:54,929 --> 00:36:55,170
Scott: now?"

500
00:36:55,793 --> 00:36:58,610
Scott: And you go for what you think is going to be good right at that moment.

501
00:36:59,111 --> 00:37:05,370
Scott: Unless one of your very, very few committed activities is occurring, in which case, you usually want to prepare for those ahead of time.

502
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:06,747
Scott: Like, you know.

503
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:12,690
Rym: Yup, and I've found this advice applies to really small conventions and really large conventions pretty much equally.

504
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:19,550
Rym: Because I've been to some very, very small cons that had like two event rooms and like one tiny dealer's room.

505
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:28,590
Rym: And even then, there's one or two events that you want to go to and the rest of the fun is really just kind of ad hoc and it comes randomly and you really can't prepare for it or expect it.

506
00:37:29,651 --> 00:37:33,709
Rym: And if you try to schedule out your whole day, you're going to end up missing out on a lot of fun.

507
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:40,930
Scott: I mean, how many times do you look at the schedule and you say, "Gee, you know, I don't know if I want to go to this or if I want to go to that.

508
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,264
Scott: That looks fun, I'm not

509
00:37:42,325 --> 00:37:42,527
Scott: sure.".

510
00:37:42,991 --> 00:37:46,090
Scott: The description in the con book isn't always very helpful.

511
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:54,908
Rym: Yeah, like, we're not sure what it was to this day, but we saw an event at a con I went to called "Hentai Hot

512
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:55,229
Rym: Tub."

513
00:37:56,513 --> 00:37:57,910
Rym: And we weren't sure what that meant.

514
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:04,550
Rym: We know what hentai is, we know what a hot tub is, but the two together, we were curious enough to try to figure out what the hell it was.

515
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:12,549
Rym: But the con book didn't really give us any information other than the time and it didn't actually say where it was either.

516
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:15,206
Scott: Maybe it was just made up.

517
00:38:15,613 --> 00:38:16,409
Rym: Yeah, I'm not sure.

518
00:38:17,531 --> 00:38:19,229
Scott: But here's a good example that comes to mind.

519
00:38:19,951 --> 00:38:25,090
Scott: At Otakon last year, there was the Great Teacher Largo panel.

520
00:38:25,411 --> 00:38:27,450
Rym: Oh, we thought that was going to be so awesome.

521
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,693
Scott: We weren't sure exactly.

522
00:38:28,733 --> 00:38:35,190
Scott: was he going to show up, because he's a cool guy, or is this going to be some mega Tokyo fanboy thing, or what the hell was it going to be?

523
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:39,287
Scott: And, you know, we didn't say, "Alright, we're definitely going to

524
00:38:39,327 --> 00:38:39,508
Scott: that.".

525
00:38:39,931 --> 00:38:42,929
Scott: But on Sunday, when the time came for it, we said, "Alright, what do we want to

526
00:38:42,949 --> 00:38:43,029
Scott: do?".

527
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:45,790
Scott: And we looked, and that was there, and there were some other things.

528
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,227
Scott: So we said, "Alright, we'll go look at

529
00:38:47,247 --> 00:38:47,288
Scott: it.".

530
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:53,330
Scott: We went there, and five minutes into it, there was an annoying kid, and nothing happened, and it kind of sucked.

531
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:54,610
Rym: Was that kid a guy or a girl?

532
00:38:54,775 --> 00:38:55,070
Scott: I don't know.

533
00:38:55,293 --> 00:38:56,589
Rym: It was just this annoying kid.

534
00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:01,550
Rym: Like, super fanboy, and followed us around, and we barely escaped with our lives.

535
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:07,110
Scott: Yeah, uh, it's good to meet people at conventions, new people.

536
00:39:07,431 --> 00:39:09,990
Scott: That's, in fact, most of the fun is meeting all kinds of cool people.

537
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:18,810
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I have friends that are con friends, that I see them at multiple cons every year, and I'm very close to them, but that's the only way I know them, is through the conventions.

538
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:30,590
Scott: But if some annoying person comes up to you, like some fanboy, and starts talking to you, it's okay to just, you know, make them go away, because they're only going to make your time at the con painful.

539
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:42,070
Rym: Now, if you're a polite person, or you have trouble brushing people off like that, a real good trick is to have a fake aim name ready, because eventually they'll ask you what your aim name is, and they can catch up with you later.

540
00:39:42,571 --> 00:39:43,172
Rym: Just lie.

541
00:39:43,934 --> 00:39:46,038
Rym: Just lie straight up, and then you'll never see them again.

542
00:39:46,078 --> 00:39:47,521
Rym: The con's so big, it won't matter.

543
00:39:47,621 --> 00:39:51,810
Rym: Or the con's so small, you're screwed, because they'll follow you around for the whole con.

544
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:56,614
Scott: Another good idea is to team up with someone who can brush them off.

545
00:39:57,235 --> 00:40:08,750
Scott: You know, a lot of times, if, you know, there'll be a nerdy guy who's trying to bother you, but you're hanging out with someone who he, like, is kind of afraid of going near, even though he really wants to get close to you.

546
00:40:09,191 --> 00:40:14,210
Scott: But as long as you stay close to that safety person, it's sort of like a repelling magnet, you can keep them away.

547
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:19,730
Rym: Now, at the same time, don't push people away automatically, because you'll meet a lot of cool people, like we said.

548
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:24,630
Scott: Oh yeah, only brush someone away if they're, like, a super annoying fan person that's just painful to stand next to.

549
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:29,010
Rym: Yeah, like if a big ol' fat guy comes over and starts telling you about his hentai collection, brush him off.

550
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:36,029
Scott: Or if a little nerdy kid comes up and says, "Oh my god, DDR, blah blah blah, I can get this on this song, I can get this on this song, oh my god, I beat this song on this song...".

551
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:38,305
Scott: You say, "Alright, shut up and go

552
00:40:38,346 --> 00:40:38,487
Scott: away.".

553
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:44,450
Rym: But if you run into, say, us, if you say, "Hey," we'll say, "Hey," and we'll probably end up going to the AMV contest together.

554
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,230
Scott: Yeah, if you say Leroy, we say Jenkins.

555
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:55,810
Rym: Actually, we went to Otakon, and just so you know, we yelled Leroy, and in fact, an entire crowd of people screamed Jenkins back.

556
00:40:56,610 --> 00:41:02,250
Scott: Yeah, there are certain things you can do with cons, sort of like a litmus test, to tell if people are cool.

557
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:07,610
Scott: You know, and that's sort of like a really weak one, is to say Leroy and see if they say Jenkins.

558
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:12,930
Scott: Because if they say Jenkins, that means that, you know, they're cool, happening-on-the-internet type of people.

559
00:41:13,634 --> 00:41:14,170
Scott: You know that much.

560
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:16,049
Rym: I mean, it depends on what kind of con it is and who you're looking for.

561
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:16,692
Rym: Mm-hmm.

562
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:23,423
Scott: Well, if it's, like, BotCon, you can say, like, what's that thing the Transformers say?

563
00:41:23,443 --> 00:41:25,949
Scott: The little internet, the universal...

564
00:41:26,555 --> 00:41:27,170
Rym: I don't even remember.

565
00:41:28,091 --> 00:41:34,370
Rym: Yeah, you know what, because I've seen that movie so many times, but that universal peace thing is so complicated, I've never memorized it.

566
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,770
Scott: It's like Chub Niffy something.

567
00:41:35,992 --> 00:41:36,078
Scott: Yeah.

568
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:36,950
Scott: I don't even remember.

569
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:37,827
Rym: Neither do I.

570
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,875
Scott: If I see it, I'll go, "Oh, that's what that...".

571
00:41:39,975 --> 00:41:44,750
Scott: I recognize it immediately, but yeah, if you say that kind of thing, you know, it all depends on the con.

572
00:41:45,150 --> 00:42:08,190
Rym: I mean, the main thing to remember is that while anime cons and gaming cons and all these different geeky cons are all, like, a different subset of geekery... We're kind of leaving out the trade conventions a little bit here, but they're all geeks, and a lot of geeks have similar interests, and they may not be super in... Like, you're in an anime con, there's a good chance you'll find some Linux geeks or some gaming geeks and hang out with them independent of the anime.

573
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:13,650
Scott: Yeah, you know, I actually didn't watch, really, any anime at all at Otakon.

574
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:19,070
Scott: I did so few anime-related activities, actually, other than buying anime merchandise, it was scary.

575
00:42:19,331 --> 00:42:25,090
Rym: Yeah, I mean, one of the highlights was seeing Entertainment System, the band, play NES songs for us in a little concert.

576
00:42:26,174 --> 00:42:27,449
Scott: That was one of the things we committed to.

577
00:42:28,031 --> 00:42:29,183
Rym: Yeah, and you know what?

578
00:42:29,204 --> 00:42:29,648
Rym: It was worth it.

579
00:42:30,371 --> 00:42:30,889
Scott: Definitely worth it.

580
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:36,350
Scott: So, eating at the con is sort of tricky, depending on where the con is at.

581
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:39,970
Rym: Now, if it's a small con, it really doesn't matter, you don't have to worry about it at all.

582
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:48,450
Rym: Because every small con I've gone to, basically, everyone just gets together, and then they either go out, because there's a million restaurants nearby, or they order a pizza and have it delivered to the hotel.

583
00:42:49,352 --> 00:42:55,850
Rym: I mean, at UberCon, there were literally like a hundred pizzas delivered to the hotel under various names over the course of the evening on Saturday.

584
00:42:56,432 --> 00:42:59,450
Scott: You never want to eat in the hotel or convention center, ever.

585
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:01,209
Rym: Yes, that goes doubly so.

586
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:03,970
Scott: Unless it's free food provided by the convention itself.

587
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:06,590
Rym: Yeah, Anime Central used to have the most awesome thing.

588
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:12,309
Rym: I don't know if they still do it, but basically, they had a green room that had infinite free food.

589
00:43:12,851 --> 00:43:20,330
Rym: And by infinite free food, I mean actual food, like sandwiches with meat and cheese on them, and chips and crackers and soda and fruit and drinks.

590
00:43:21,811 --> 00:43:23,610
Rym: It was absolutely free to anyone who went to the con.

591
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:27,170
Rym: You could go to Anime Central and not spend a dime on food and not die.

592
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:31,170
Scott: Also, most cons provide free water, so never buy bottled water, ever.

593
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:33,689
Rym: Yeah, but make sure you have money for food.

594
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:39,590
Rym: Make sure your group either has a way to get in touch, or has a planned time to meet for dinner.

595
00:43:40,133 --> 00:43:43,070
Rym: Don't worry so much about lunch, because you're all going to be doing different things anyway.

596
00:43:44,293 --> 00:43:47,170
Rym: It takes a long time to organize a group to go out for dinner.

597
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:53,008
Scott: I usually just take as many people as I can get right now, and then we go, "Okay, good, let's

598
00:43:53,028 --> 00:43:53,129
Scott: eat."

599
00:43:54,695 --> 00:43:57,827
Scott: Our total group of people that we knew at the con was like 30 or 40 people.

600
00:43:59,531 --> 00:44:10,490
Rym: And we always organize the crazy dinners, because it takes about an hour to gather a group of that size, get them together, get them all to agree on a restaurant, drag them all there, sit them all down, and then finally start eating.

601
00:44:11,031 --> 00:44:12,709
Rym: You don't want to do that three times a day.

602
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:18,150
Rym: So over lunch, me and Scott and five or six other people would all find each other and go eat.

603
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:22,746
Rym: And then while we're eating, we'd see half of our group come in to eat, just as we're leaving.

604
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:23,670
Rym: We kind of trade off.

605
00:44:26,432 --> 00:44:31,170
Scott: And the other thing is, you have to know the food places in the area.

606
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:38,290
Scott: I remember the first Otakon, I didn't really realize that the walkway went to the little mini mall with the food court.

607
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:42,450
Rym: Yep, I walked across the street to this other crat mall, and all they had was pizza, and it was bad pizza.

608
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:51,970
Scott: Yeah, so make sure before you eat to ask either people at the con or con staff or someone where the food is at.

609
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:58,989
Rym: If it's a hotel or you're in a hotel, the concierge will always know good restaurants, and they're usually very polite about it.

610
00:44:59,591 --> 00:45:05,190
Rym: And if you're really worried about money, you can give them a dollar range, and they'll be very good and give you restaurants that you can afford.

611
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:06,608
Rym: Don't be afraid to ask.

612
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:11,485
Scott: Yeah, and even if you ask people in the hotel, they won't just say, "Eat in the restaurant at the

613
00:45:11,525 --> 00:45:12,087
Scott: hotel!"

614
00:45:12,188 --> 00:45:12,730
Scott: all the time.

615
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:13,944
Rym: They'll usually say, "Don't eat

616
00:45:13,984 --> 00:45:14,166
Rym: here.".

617
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:16,109
Scott: Yeah, they'll actually help you out.

618
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:21,550
Scott: And you don't want to eat at a sit-down restaurant unless it's dinner at night.

619
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:22,713
Rym: Yeah, I mean, we did that.

620
00:45:22,733 --> 00:45:24,922
Rym: We dragged everyone to a Japanese sushi place.

621
00:45:24,962 --> 00:45:26,790
Rym: We took the entire back room.

622
00:45:27,911 --> 00:45:30,849
Rym: But it's kind of difficult to pull off, so don't worry about that so much.

623
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:37,569
Scott: If you're going to eat breakfast, because I really don't eat breakfast at a con, I'll just buy an orange juice and a bottle and drink it, and that's it.

624
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:41,770
Scott: But if you're going to eat breakfast, eat it before the con opens in the morning.

625
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:46,230
Scott: Just because, why waste precious con time when you don't have to?

626
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:49,526
Rym: Your best bet is to buy a bunch of cheapo Entenmann's donuts or something.

627
00:45:49,566 --> 00:45:50,310
Rym: Just keep them in the room.

628
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:52,009
Scott: Yeah, that's another good plan.

629
00:45:52,552 --> 00:45:56,610
Rym: Or our friend Nuri brought cheese Danish that was most excellent, and that kept us going at Otakon.

630
00:45:57,731 --> 00:46:11,350
Scott: For lunch, you generally want to find a time in the middle of the day when there's not much happening at the con, and you want to eat somewhere food court style, or maybe even fast food, even though I never eat fast food anymore.

631
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:13,056
Rym: Yeah, well, the key is eat something.

632
00:46:13,418 --> 00:46:15,767
Rym: A lot of people forget to eat at these conventions.

633
00:46:15,887 --> 00:46:16,550
Rym: I'm not kidding.

634
00:46:16,811 --> 00:46:26,643
Scott: Yeah, or some people are fat and they eat too much, but don't forget to eat, because you will totally be burnt out, you'll sleep too much, you'll miss con, you'll feel bad.

635
00:46:27,387 --> 00:46:27,990
Scott: Remember to eat.

636
00:46:28,831 --> 00:46:30,977
Rym: Yep, and corollary to that, stay hydrated.

637
00:46:31,378 --> 00:46:41,610
Rym: Convention centers, especially larger ones, use cooling systems, because even though it may be winter at your con, the air in that convention center is so dry it is sucking the life out of you.

638
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:44,142
Rym: You will dehydrate twice as fast as you expect.

639
00:46:44,484 --> 00:46:45,650
Rym: Drink water constantly.

640
00:46:45,811 --> 00:46:49,390
Scott: I just go around drinking free water, like any time I see one, I drink like three glasses.

641
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:56,086
Rym: It's not so much a concern at small conventions, but like Otakon or Anime Expo, drink water.

642
00:46:56,106 --> 00:46:57,270
Rym: I'm not even kidding.

643
00:46:58,871 --> 00:47:02,369
Scott: It's pretty, especially if you're doing one of those crazy cosplays, I don't know how those people do it.

644
00:47:04,172 --> 00:47:06,309
Scott: I mean, I freaking need like a camel pack in there.

645
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:11,850
Rym: That, or people are in the DDR tournaments, or people at the dances at cons.

646
00:47:13,232 --> 00:47:14,277
Rym: Yeah, we'll get to the dances.

647
00:47:14,839 --> 00:47:20,650
Rym: But along the lines of remembering to eat and remembering to drink, for the love of God, take a goddamn shower.

648
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:32,950
Scott: Yeah, don't, you know, if you wake up, like, I don't know, five minutes before the con opens, right, and it's something you really wanted to do, but you smell like ass, and you feel dirty, it doesn't matter, take a shower.

649
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:36,879
Rym: Yeah, I mean, this shouldn't be a problem, and it's not just anime cons.

650
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,690
Rym: Gaming cons are even worse, and sci-fi cons are worse still.

651
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:46,870
Rym: I don't know what it is, but these people just don't have basic hygiene, and it's not cool.

652
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:50,450
Scott: It's alright, because cons are starting to crack down on that sort of thing.

653
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:57,270
Rym: Yeah, actually, Otakon, I'm very pleased with, is bit by bit introducing policies to where if you smell bad, you've gotta leave.

654
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:01,290
Scott: Yeah, so don't be the guy who smells bad and has to leave.

655
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:04,010
Rym: If you're not sure if you smell bad, ask someone.

656
00:48:04,472 --> 00:48:09,010
Scott: There are drugstores every freaking two blocks in the United States and Canada.

657
00:48:09,351 --> 00:48:13,910
Scott: There is no reason that you can't go to one and get some deodorant, because your only excuse is that you left it at home.

658
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:23,810
Rym: Yeah, and the thing is, if you're gonna take part in the DDR tournament at 5 AM, or like 10 AM in the morning on Saturday, take a shower before you continue with the rest of your con experience.

659
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:28,390
Scott: And then take a shower after, or before the con, before the DDR tournament and after it.

660
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:33,030
Rym: Just take showers, because I swear to God, if I run into another smelly fanboy, I'm just gonna kill him.

661
00:48:33,431 --> 00:48:41,170
Scott: Yeah, there's nothing worse than like, you're in the dealer's room, and you wanna buy something on a table, and you're trying to get close to the table to take a look at it.

662
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:48,570
Scott: And you have to squeeze in next to some guy who's like wet and slimy and nasty, and it's like, alright, now I'm not buying that.

663
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:49,859
Scott: You know?

664
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:58,180
Rym: Now one aspect that a lot of people forget about when they go with a big group to a con is communication between group members.

665
00:48:59,881 --> 00:49:11,339
Rym: It's not as much of an issue as it used to be, like we used to bring radios, actually there's a- We have a story to tell, a little bit of it inside a joke.

666
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:20,940
Rym: Alright, so before cellphones were completely ubiquitous, our first convention, OhioCon.

667
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:21,500
Rym: Two.

668
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,660
Rym: Yeah, the second OhioCon we went to, and cellphones were pretty widespread, but- They were ubiquitous, we didn't have them.

669
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,146
Rym: Yeah, we didn't have cellphones.

670
00:49:28,388 --> 00:49:30,940
Rym: Not, oh in fact, no one in our group had a cellphone.

671
00:49:31,522 --> 00:49:31,611
Scott: Wow.

672
00:49:32,441 --> 00:49:42,000
Rym: And we got there, and because we ran the RIT Anime Club, we took the walkie-talkies from the club vault and brought them with us, because, you know, we have that privilege, whatever.

673
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:50,120
Rym: So we had all these walkie-talkies, and we discovered that a lot of other people at this con had the same walkie-talkies with the same frequency bands.

674
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:53,220
Scott: Or at least other walkie-talkies on the same frequency.

675
00:49:53,921 --> 00:50:00,540
Rym: And we also discovered that one channel, I forget which one it was, was the Staff/Security Coordination channel.

676
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:11,799
Rym: So, we're sitting there, and I don't know which one of us started, it was either me or Scott, but we picked it up and one of us was like into the microphone in a random channel or some other people were talking.

677
00:50:12,941 --> 00:50:13,960
Rym: It's-a me, Mario!

678
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,545
Scott: Hello?

679
00:50:16,565 --> 00:50:18,899
Scott: Is he looking at us so good?

680
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,106
Rym: And then we started doing Luigi.

681
00:50:22,849 --> 00:50:25,880
Rym: And then other people who heard this started doing it too.

682
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:30,840
Rym: And the walkie-talkies that everyone had brought to this con became useless.

683
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,900
Rym: It just became a flood of Marios and Luigis yelling crap at each other.

684
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:39,715
Rym: To the point that the security people were like, "We can't use these anymore, backup plan, backup plan,".

685
00:50:39,735 --> 00:50:41,120
Rym: and they stopped using the walkie-talkies.

686
00:50:42,404 --> 00:50:43,360
Rym: It was hilarious.

687
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,350
Scott: There's nothing better than picking it up and being like, "Hello?

688
00:50:47,732 --> 00:50:48,514
Scott: Is Mario there?

689
00:50:48,534 --> 00:50:49,518
Scott: I cannot find

690
00:50:49,578 --> 00:50:49,739
Scott: him.".

691
00:50:51,741 --> 00:50:52,184
Scott: And they'd be like,

692
00:50:52,425 --> 00:50:54,378
Scott: "Tiddle-A-Luigi-bo-de-ba-de-ba-do.".

693
00:50:54,981 --> 00:51:03,839
Rym: But now everyone just has cell phones, make sure everyone has each other's numbers, and make sure that if- Don't expect that anyone's going to answer your phone.

694
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,220
Rym: Because if you call someone, odds are they don't notice it ringing until an hour later.

695
00:51:09,262 --> 00:51:10,980
Rym: So never expect quick communication.

696
00:51:12,301 --> 00:51:14,899
Scott: And then you have those next telephones that do the walkie-talkie thing.

697
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:23,840
Scott: Even then, someone won't feel it vibrating, they'll be busy and they can't pick it up, they'll be watching a movie, they won't want to pick it up, they won't hear it ring.

698
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,640
Scott: Just don't worry about it.

699
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,826
Rym: If you're the caller, call someone once.

700
00:51:28,307 --> 00:51:32,640
Rym: If they don't answer, call someone else, or don't worry about it, you're not going to get ahold of them.

701
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:38,360
Scott: Yeah, most of the time when you're calling, you're looking for people to group up, or you're trying to figure out where people are.

702
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:44,080
Scott: Maybe in the future we'll have awesome GPS technology, you'll know exactly where everyone is, just looking at a little screen.

703
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,212
Rym: And if you're calling people to organize dinner, it's already too late.

704
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:50,540
Rym: You had to coordinate the dinner long before it's done.

705
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,291
Scott: If it's a sitting down dinner, you have to take care of that way earlier.

706
00:51:54,331 --> 00:51:57,280
Scott: You have to say early in the morning when everyone's still in the hotel room.

707
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,129
Scott: "Alright everyone, remember...".

708
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:01,300
Scott: And this will be the third time you're reminding them, by the way.

709
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:06,133
Scott: "Tonight, at 8, we're all going to meet here and then decide on a restaurant.

710
00:52:06,394 --> 00:52:07,718
Scott: If you're not there at 8, you're not

711
00:52:07,778 --> 00:52:08,039
Scott: going.".

712
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:21,020
Rym: Now if you're the one receiving calls, especially us, or if you're the person who's running this room or you're the one coordinating everything, just look at your phone periodically and see all the missed messages and then call back the people who deserve calls back.

713
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:27,360
Scott: Yeah, I make it a note that whenever I enter or leave an event at the con, I always just look at the phone.

714
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:30,960
Scott: Mostly to see what time it is, but also to see if anyone left me a voicemail.

715
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:31,500
Rym: Yep.

716
00:52:32,683 --> 00:52:34,809
Rym: And make sure you have some predefined meeting places.

717
00:52:34,869 --> 00:52:39,300
Rym: Like, pick a few places where you can meet that are obvious and you'll be able to find each other.

718
00:52:39,821 --> 00:52:43,040
Rym: Again, not so much a concern at small cons, but large cons, it's critical.

719
00:52:44,044 --> 00:52:44,599
Scott: Very critical.

720
00:52:45,403 --> 00:52:48,160
Rym: And make sure it's a place where you can actually find the person.

721
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:53,980
Scott: Make sure it's a place everyone actually knows, because a lot of times you'll be like, "Alright, everyone meet here," and people will go right, and they'll all go someplace different.

722
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:54,899
Scott: Because they're all dumb.

723
00:52:55,220 --> 00:53:00,340
Rym: Or they'll all meet somewhere, and the place you specified is a giant auditorium with a movie playing full of people.

724
00:53:00,962 --> 00:53:01,051
Scott: Yeah.

725
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:01,468
Scott: Great.

726
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,991
Scott: You usually want to pick an outdoors location that's not crowded.

727
00:53:05,212 --> 00:53:07,600
Scott: That is sort of like a little ways from the con.

728
00:53:07,921 --> 00:53:13,260
Rym: And if you go to Otakon, don't pick the freaking fountains, because everyone's trying to meet everyone at the fountains.

729
00:53:14,381 --> 00:53:14,899
Scott: Fountains bad.

730
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:15,462
Scott: Yeah.

731
00:53:15,764 --> 00:53:17,600
Rym: Plus all the cosplayers are there constantly.

732
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:22,940
Scott: We usually pick, like, sculptures, or any sort of landmark is always good.

733
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:30,900
Rym: Now, almost all cons have a dealer's room, and this will be pivotal to your experience at a con if you've never been to a con before.

734
00:53:31,762 --> 00:53:38,180
Rym: I mean, just to give you an example, Otakon, the dealer's room is, what, eleven football fields?

735
00:53:38,282 --> 00:53:39,120
Scott: It's not eleven football fields.

736
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:40,360
Rym: It was nine football fields, right?

737
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,580
Scott: I thought it was like four or five.

738
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:42,899
Rym: No, it was nine at least.

739
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:43,616
Scott: It was huge.

740
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,306
Scott: It doesn't matter.

741
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:45,680
Scott: It's very, very large.

742
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:48,260
Scott: You can't see from one end to the other.

743
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:55,560
Scott: I mean, it was about as big as more than one whole room at the Jacob Javits Center.

744
00:53:56,443 --> 00:53:56,958
Scott: Very large.

745
00:53:57,582 --> 00:54:03,120
Rym: Now, basically to sum up, make sure you have money to pay for gas and everything home.

746
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,320
Rym: Don't spend all your money in the dealer's room.

747
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:14,400
Rym: Two, you probably want to pay with credit cards, because all the dealers will take it, even at little crap cons, and you don't want to be carrying wads of cash around in a sea of people.

748
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:23,380
Scott: Yeah, but sometimes, like, one time I tried to buy a Gundam with a credit card, and they accepted it, but I had to go to, like, another booth and pay there, and it was a pain in the ass.

749
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,643
Scott: So have cash also.

750
00:54:25,184 --> 00:54:32,580
Scott: But to make sure you can make it home, have enough cash to make it home and leave it in your hotel room in a safe spot so you can't possibly spend it.

751
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,670
Rym: Furthermore, and this is kind of an aside, but ATMs and cash.

752
00:54:37,171 --> 00:54:40,480
Rym: Bring cash with you to the con and keep it in the room or something.

753
00:54:40,981 --> 00:54:44,119
Rym: Or, if you don't have it with you yet, get it immediately from an ATM.

754
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:49,860
Scott: And make as few withdrawals from ATMs as possible, because near convention centers, the ATM fees are insane.

755
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,420
Rym: Well, not only that, more importantly...

756
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,939
Scott: You don't pay ATM fees, but other people do.

757
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:54,388
Rym: Uh, yeah, whatever.

758
00:54:54,428 --> 00:54:55,340
Rym: Your bank kinda sucks.

759
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,199
Scott: My bank's awesome.

760
00:54:57,501 --> 00:55:05,080
Rym: Paying...using ATMs is important more because the ATMs within a several mile radius of any large con will be completely empty by Friday night.

761
00:55:05,522 --> 00:55:07,300
Scott: And no one fills those things on the weekends.

762
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:13,056
Rym: I was actually at a con, uh, Anime Central, where it was time to pay the lady for the suite.

763
00:55:13,357 --> 00:55:14,380
Rym: So I owed her, like, 80 bucks.

764
00:55:14,882 --> 00:55:18,440
Rym: And I figure, alright, fine, I go down to the ATM and I try to get money out, and it's empty.

765
00:55:19,301 --> 00:55:21,380
Rym: And now I have no way of paying this woman.

766
00:55:23,066 --> 00:55:23,340
Scott: Sucks.

767
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,860
Rym: Yeah, I ended up writing her a check, which I felt bad about.

768
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,619
Scott: Yeah, I don't write checks so much.

769
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:30,558
Rym: Yeah.

770
00:55:32,042 --> 00:55:34,500
Scott: Another thing is, you generally want to have a dealer's room strategy.

771
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:38,960
Scott: Like, if it's a little tiny dealer's room at a tiny con, don't worry about it.

772
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,660
Scott: Just go in there once or twice and look over everything and buy anything you really want.

773
00:55:43,481 --> 00:55:52,600
Scott: And on Sunday, you can probably...well, on the last day of any convention, any dealer is usually trying to sell, you know, a whole bunch of stuff at the last minute.

774
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:53,780
Rym: You'll get crazy deals.

775
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,060
Scott: You can probably get a crazy deal if you're savvy.

776
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:59,199
Rym: Our friend Scott Johnson is probably the Mac Master of this.

777
00:55:59,620 --> 00:55:59,711
Scott: Yeah.

778
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:07,200
Rym: We don't know how he does it, but Sunday, he just went into the dealer's room on his own, and he walked out with, like, a sack full of various goodies.

779
00:56:07,804 --> 00:56:09,180
Rym: And it cost him almost nothing.

780
00:56:09,341 --> 00:56:12,578
Scott: Yeah, he comes up to us and he's like, "Here's all the DVDs I got at the

781
00:56:12,598 --> 00:56:12,880
Scott: con.".

782
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,145
Scott: And he's got this, like, tower.

783
00:56:14,165 --> 00:56:18,080
Scott: It's like a five foot tall...well, not like five feet, but like a two and a half foot tall tower of DVDs.

784
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,886
Scott: And he's like, "Yep, I got 40 DVDs here.

785
00:56:21,287 --> 00:56:23,973
Scott: Cost me, uh, let's see, 40 DVDs.

786
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:25,577
Scott: It usually costs, let's see, times

787
00:56:25,577 --> 00:56:27,463
Scott: $2,800.".

788
00:56:27,463 --> 00:56:28,993
Scott: He's like, "Yep, I paid, like, 150 bucks for

789
00:56:29,013 --> 00:56:29,113
Scott: this.".

790
00:56:30,462 --> 00:56:31,449
Scott: And you're like, "Holy

791
00:56:31,469 --> 00:56:32,778
Scott: damn.".

792
00:56:33,221 --> 00:56:35,699
Rym: Granted, he's got a lot of bad anime as a result of this.

793
00:56:36,162 --> 00:56:37,140
Scott: Yeah, but, you know...

794
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,208
Rym: But also the goodies.

795
00:56:38,289 --> 00:56:39,820
Rym: He gets every little goodie for nothing.

796
00:56:41,043 --> 00:56:41,103
Scott: Mhm.

797
00:56:41,123 --> 00:56:42,570
Scott: Also, there's a lot of free stuff.

798
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:44,540
Scott: they give away in dealer's rooms often.

799
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:46,189
Rym: Well, only really at large cons.

800
00:56:46,229 --> 00:56:48,100
Rym: I mean, I didn't get crap at Katsu-Con.

801
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:48,701
Scott: Oh, yeah.

802
00:56:49,001 --> 00:57:02,860
Scott: But when they give away free stuff, you want to have a time when you're about to go to your hotel room, go in, collect every free thing that you want at all, and then bring it back to your hotel room, because carrying it around the con sucks.

803
00:57:03,302 --> 00:57:04,508
Rym: That goes for buying things, too.

804
00:57:04,548 --> 00:57:06,940
Rym: If you're buying anything big, buy it before you go into the room.

805
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:13,760
Rym: Now, also, don't buy things that you can get outside of the con, because you'll probably pay a lot more.

806
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:14,842
Scott: Yeah, be smart.

807
00:57:15,143 --> 00:57:21,420
Scott: If you see something in the convention center that you can buy online or you can buy in another store, there's no reason to buy it there.

808
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,464
Rym: The worst thing are those frickin' swords.

809
00:57:23,864 --> 00:57:31,240
Rym: Every con now, they'll have one or two guys selling, like, paintball guns and airsoft guns and giant swords and stupid crap like that.

810
00:57:31,841 --> 00:57:33,587
Rym: And fanboys just eat it up and they buy 'em.

811
00:57:33,607 --> 00:57:34,610
Rym: I don't know why.

812
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:38,040
Rym: They're overpriced, they're crappy, you can't actually carry it around at the con.

813
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:44,758
Scott: Now, if you're over 18 and a little kid comes up to you and says, "Hey, if I give you money, will you buy me a

814
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:45,099
Scott: sword?".

815
00:57:45,701 --> 00:57:46,242
Scott: You say, "All

816
00:57:46,282 --> 00:57:46,463
Scott: right.".

817
00:57:46,844 --> 00:57:49,250
Scott: You don't say no, even though that's a good thing to say.

818
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:51,395
Scott: You sure as hell don't just say yes, sure.

819
00:57:51,756 --> 00:57:53,140
Scott: That's also a stupid thing to say.

820
00:57:53,581 --> 00:57:55,345
Scott: What you say is, "How much is the

821
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:55,766
Scott: sword?".

822
00:57:56,388 --> 00:57:57,971
Scott: And let's say he says the sword's 100 bucks.

823
00:57:57,992 --> 00:58:00,297
Scott: You say, "You give me 150 and I'll buy you the $100

824
00:58:00,297 --> 00:58:00,397
Scott: sword.".

825
00:58:01,641 --> 00:58:05,560
Scott: That's the way to do it, because then you go and you get a $50 awesome thing somewhere else.

826
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,700
Rym: Yeah, see, I generally disagree with that.

827
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:09,651
Scott: No, I like it.

828
00:58:09,692 --> 00:58:10,139
Scott: It's a good way.

829
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:21,540
Rym: Well, one, that doesn't work, because usually they ship the sword to your hotel room or they give it to you in a giant sealed box and you're escorted out, then you have to take it and store it somewhere.

830
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,659
Rym: Mostly they make you ship them home.

831
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:25,487
Scott: I'd ship them home.

832
00:58:25,608 --> 00:58:26,720
Scott: I'd just give them the kid's address.

833
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,659
Rym: Yeah, that doesn't work if you have the credit card.

834
00:58:30,925 --> 00:58:31,320
Scott: I guess not.

835
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,639
Rym: Because the billing address doesn't match up.

836
00:58:33,342 --> 00:58:33,880
Scott: It all depends.

837
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,727
Rym: Yeah, Scott's dumb.

838
00:58:34,767 --> 00:58:36,079
Rym: Don't buy swords for little kids.

839
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,313
Scott: Well, not like little kids, but like a 16-year-old kid.

840
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,788
Rym: Yeah, a 16-year-old punk kid.

841
00:58:40,849 --> 00:58:42,860
Rym: You want to give him a sword at an anime con.

842
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,640
Scott: Hey, if he's done with it, that's his problem.

843
00:58:47,542 --> 00:58:48,907
Scott: Plus, you can always deny.

844
00:58:48,927 --> 00:58:52,700
Scott: You can be like, "No, I was just buying the sword for me," and then you make off with the kid's money.

845
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:54,119
Scott: All right.

846
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,018
Scott: He was dumb enough to give it to you.

847
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:03,640
Rym: Well, that said, we've talked a long time about a lot of topics with very little organization, and I think we're going to have to do a part three in this series.

848
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,000
Scott: What are we going to talk about in part three?

849
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:12,260
Rym: Basically, first of all, we've got to talk about how to leave the con, which is actually more complicated than you'd think.

850
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,244
Rym: You'd be surprised.

851
00:59:15,445 --> 00:59:21,860
Rym: If you don't plan out leaving the con at the end of your experience, you're going to have a nightmare, and you won't do anything fun on Sunday.

852
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:29,840
Scott: If there's a time when you have to check out of the hotel by, and if you don't check out by then, the hotel yells at you for leaving late.

853
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,953
Rym: And in fact, that time is a lie, because you want to check out four hours before that.

854
00:59:33,993 --> 00:59:35,920
Rym: if you want any chance of having a good time on Sunday.

855
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:37,605
Scott: Yeah, because think about it.

856
00:59:37,625 --> 00:59:40,580
Scott: That time when you have to check out is while there's convention happening.

857
00:59:41,141 --> 00:59:48,060
Rym: That, and we'll also talk about most cons have a dance or a rave, and we have many opinions regarding those.

858
00:59:48,843 --> 00:59:49,980
Scott: That's a good thing to talk about.

859
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:50,905
Rym: So?

860
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:59,040
Scott: Oh, we should probably also talk about if a lot of conventions, even of all sorts, have artists' alleys or things nowadays.

861
00:59:59,261 --> 01:00:00,960
Rym: Oh yeah, we'll also talk about the artists' alleys.

862
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:05,540
Scott: We'll talk about what to do if you want to be in the artists' alley or visit it and such.

863
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,244
Rym: Yep.

864
01:00:06,874 --> 01:00:07,260
Rym: We out.

865
01:00:14,551 --> 01:00:16,699
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

866
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:19,310
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

867
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:24,089
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontrowcrew.com.

868
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:27,284
Scott: If you like our podcasts, you'll love our forums.

869
01:00:27,365 --> 01:00:28,089
Scott: Make sure you visit them.

870
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:32,089
Scott: You can send your email feedback to geeknights@gmail.com.

871
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:34,737
Scott: And if you want, you can leave us a voicemail at 206-333-1537.

872
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:42,190
Rym: GeekNights airs every weeknight, Monday through Thursday.

873
01:00:42,894 --> 01:00:46,130
Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

874
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:50,010
Scott: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
