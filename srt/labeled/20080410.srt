00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,488
Scott: It's Thursday April 10th.

00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:12,491
Rym: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,832 --> 00:00:15,300
Scott: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,723 --> 00:00:18,480
Scott: What if we were supervillains of evil?

5
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:26,902
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:31,062 --> 00:00:33,572
Rym: What a lovely day.

7
00:00:33,752 --> 00:00:39,864
Scott: I don't think that's got to stop right now But it was a lovely day No, wasn't?

8
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:41,008
Scott: it was just nice out.

9

Scott: It was love.

10
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:42,694
Rym: It was beautiful.

11
00:00:42,714 --> 00:00:44,119
Rym: I took like an hour wasn't?

12
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:45,910
Rym: Love?

00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:47,440
Rym: what a lovely time.

14
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:50,790
Rym: Sun is singing the birds are shining.

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,174
Scott: No, it wasn't that no.

16
00:00:52,194 --> 00:00:52,374
Rym: Yes.

17
00:00:52,434 --> 00:00:52,855
Rym: It was.

18
00:00:53,217 --> 00:00:54,420
Rym: it was so nice out.

19
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:56,732
Rym: I went I had lunch in Bryant Park, and there were.

20
00:00:57,154 --> 00:01:04,992
Rym: there were at least like 3,000 people just crammed 3,000 and there was this sea of people everywhere and the streets were full.

21
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:06,858
Rym: you couldn't even walk past Bryant Park.

22
00:01:06,918 --> 00:01:07,480
Rym: It was great.

23
00:01:07,744 --> 00:01:10,031
Rym: All right It was a nice day.

24
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:10,475
Rym: What do you want?

25
00:01:10,495 --> 00:01:11,160
Rym: I went running?

26
00:01:12,161 --> 00:01:14,132
Rym: Yeah, you don't go outside you don't?

27
00:01:14,152 --> 00:01:16,262
Scott: I Went outside.

28
00:01:16,423 --> 00:01:17,005
Scott: It was nice.

29
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:20,600
Scott: Ah, and that it's not an excuse to make all sorts of annoying noises.

30
00:01:20,862 --> 00:01:22,092
Rym: It was a really nice day.

31
00:01:22,113 --> 00:01:25,004
Scott: Yeah Is that all you got?

32
00:01:25,024 --> 00:01:26,930
Scott: Yeah, it's not very exciting.

33
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:28,094
Rym: It's exciting to me.

34
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:29,860
Rym: A nice day is something to be treasured.

35
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:34,376
Scott: Now you're gonna have like a billion nice days, and you know what each one of them is amazing.

36
00:01:34,537 --> 00:01:36,098
Scott: No, not really They're all the same.

37
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:38,479
Scott: Okay, just better than the bad days.

38
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,440
Rym: Okay Yeah, well then do your news if you know if you're just gonna be there.

39
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,530
Scott: Do we don't have anything else to say.

40
00:01:47,772 --> 00:01:48,900
Scott: that was that was pretty late.

41
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,294
Scott: You told me you had like a quality opening bit that I didn't.

42
00:01:51,334 --> 00:01:53,979
Rym: I said I'll start Because you didn't seem to have anything.

43
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:58,660
Scott: All I had was the fact that I did a bunch of work at work, which is incredibly unusual.

44
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:04,306
Rym: I mean the only kind of thing I can talk about since you don't want to hear about what a lovely day Stop saying that.

45
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,900
Scott: Yeah It's a little bit annoying was that it was funny.

46
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,560
Scott: I'm sure people have already stopped listening.

47
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:17,800
Rym: So I ended up talking to the conductor because I've noticed something pretty much every day the trains that come to beacon.

48
00:02:18,342 --> 00:02:21,533
Rym: They're there one train car longer than the platform.

49
00:02:21,573 --> 00:02:23,280
Rym: because so many people come up this way.

50
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,788
Rym: Yeah, like more people that could fit on the trains.

51
00:02:25,808 --> 00:02:27,374
Rym: They originally expected so.

52
00:02:27,936 --> 00:02:30,505
Rym: the front car Never opened.

53
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:31,710
Rym: the doors do not open.

54
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:37,378
Rym: they announced this multiple times on every train but that car will not open at any of those stops.

55
00:02:37,478 --> 00:02:44,520
Rym: and despite this Every single day people like I get off the train.

56
00:02:44,600 --> 00:03:15,320
Rym: I try to get off the train like two stops before beacon people start lining up and lining up to get out near the front of the train and Every day I like I. one day by accident I sat in the front front car partly because I was in no hurry and pretty much everyone in that car was getting off in beacon and they all stood up and they stood up and waited in line to get out of the car like two stops before and It took them so long to get off because they had to walk all the way back and get off in the next car.

57
00:03:15,922 --> 00:03:21,140
Rym: That people who were sitting one or two cars back were already like at their cars before those people even got off.

58
00:03:21,762 --> 00:03:30,450
Rym: Yeah, but those people who and I heard him complain is why I sit in the second car as do I and as do all Smart people or possibly the third car.

59
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:38,606
Scott: of course I sat in the second car not today But yesterday and so I don't know what was going on, but it was so bumpy I couldn't even use my laptop like it was.

60
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:46,200
Scott: it was like this incredible like crazy shaking going on Like all the people around were laughing, but I wasn't laughing cuz I couldn't do anything.

61
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:56,971
Rym: I could have been read because the book was shaking, but I was thinking all right It's the same people every day who sit in that front car And then it takes them like five minutes to get off the stupid train.

62
00:03:56,991 --> 00:04:05,700
Rym: this train stuck there forever because everyone else is off but the people from that front car walking back and I was sitting next to a conductor and I brought it up.

63
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,530
Rym: I was like hey, so what's the deal with those people?

64
00:04:08,134 --> 00:04:17,858
Rym: and he looks at me and he goes You realize how Me and many meetings we have trying to figure out what to do with these people who just don't get how to get out and off trains.

65
00:04:19,183 --> 00:04:28,365
Rym: And apparently and he's even like we've tried announcing That's why we started announcing for the longest time the front car doesn't get off But the same people sit there every day And then the same people

66
00:04:28,385 --> 00:04:39,375
Scott: maybe instead of just saying the doors in the front car won't open They should say if you're in the front car You should probably think about you know moving back to one of the other cars

67
00:04:39,395 --> 00:04:40,117
Rym: that he's tried it.

68
00:04:40,298 --> 00:04:41,060
Rym: They've brought it up.

69
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:49,899
Rym: He's actually like said to people in the front car You know if you sat in another car you'd actually be off the train and off the platform faster than if you're sitting in this front car.

70
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,352
Rym: and He pretty much said that usually they get all indignant.

71
00:04:53,432 --> 00:04:55,200
Rym: or how dare you tell me where to sit on the train?

72
00:04:57,181 --> 00:05:07,340
Rym: But apparently the issue of people not thinking about where they sit on the train and then complaining about the train Despite the fact that all they have to do is sit somewhere else and the problem goes away.

73
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,148
Scott: You don't have to sit somewhere else.

74
00:05:08,168 --> 00:05:17,220
Scott: you can sit in the front car But instead of lining up at the door of the first car like the only one that opens Walk back a few cars and then go in line.

75
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,319
Rym: You can't because all the people in the second car are lined up facing that car to get off in the same door.

76
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:24,126
Scott: Yes, that's another problem.

77
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,773
Scott: is the people lining up to get off the train.

78
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:29,047
Rym: The funniest thing is when you get to Grand Central There's always people like the.

79
00:05:29,348 --> 00:05:30,975
Rym: I'm saying I'm sitting near the back of a car.

80
00:05:31,236 --> 00:05:37,400
Rym: people will line up Facing forward all the way to the back of the car and wait to get to the front of the car and get off.

81
00:05:37,862 --> 00:05:45,857
Rym: Meanwhile, I just walked backward like four seats get off the back of the car Yeah, and then I walk and I see those people waiting in line inside the cars.

82
00:05:45,897 --> 00:05:46,580
Rym: I walk past them.

83
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:54,000
Rym: yeah, I don't get it, but Apparently the conductors on all these trains like notice this every day and it bothers them immensely.

84
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:57,951
Rym: I'm sure it must so I no longer feel about it.

85
00:05:58,012 --> 00:05:58,132
Rym: Now.

86
00:05:58,152 --> 00:05:58,573
Rym: I just laugh.

87
00:05:58,593 --> 00:06:00,840
Rym: Yeah and sit in the second car.

88
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:02,951
Scott: I empathize with the conductor though.

89
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:04,619
Rym: I did something crazy three days ago.

90
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:16,919
Rym: I actually as an alarm because I was sitting in the back of the train to get off on the other side I got up four stops before beacon and stood in the vestibule To be the first one off the train right next to the way to get out.

91
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,519
Rym: Yeah, and one there was already someone waiting there.

92
00:06:20,821 --> 00:06:21,886
Scott: Well, how do you sure it wasn't?

93
00:06:21,926 --> 00:06:24,820
Scott: someone just didn't want to sit because I noticed a lot of people.

94
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:28,680
Scott: They'll stand in the vestibule like the whole ride just because they don't want to sit anywhere.

95
00:06:28,842 --> 00:06:30,257
Scott: Maybe they're too lazy to go.

96
00:06:30,278 --> 00:06:35,196
Scott: look It's weird because like I'll go like when I get on the 509 train, right?

97
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:49,597
Scott: I'll get on the 509 train at like 10 to 5 5 to 5 something like that, right and In the back cars of the train, there'll be people sitting on the floor The people standing in the in the doorway, right?

98
00:06:50,741 --> 00:06:54,515
Scott: And I just walk all the way up to the first and second car and there are seats.

99
00:06:55,418 --> 00:06:59,074
Scott: and I'm like Are they just so lazy to walk the distance of the train?

100
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:05,260
Scott: They have plenty of time to do it To get a seat that they just did rather just sit in the back car.

101
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:08,060
Rym: I think they don't like sitting next to people and they just sit on the floor.

102
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,820
Rym: A lot of people get real uncomfortable now that I'm doing my sit in the middle of a three-seater.

103
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,500
Rym: A lot of people get real uncomfortable and I usually get a three-seater to myself.

104
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,526
Rym: Yeah, I've been doing this every.

105
00:07:17,546 --> 00:07:23,548
Rym: it's it's it's kind of mean but it's funny Because they have the right to sit next to me and I'm not.

106
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:27,679
Rym: I'm taking up not even a full seat because I'm much narrower Than one train seat.

107
00:07:27,921 --> 00:07:32,898
Rym: Yeah, but people just can't deal with it and they they freak out and then they leave me alone and then I have the whole thing to myself.

108
00:07:34,343 --> 00:07:39,900
Rym: Anyway, I don't I don't want to keep talking about the the intricacies of seating on Metro North trains.

109
00:07:41,164 --> 00:07:47,137
Rym: So now Scott now I've noticed if I have a nice happy optimistic like yay.

110
00:07:47,197 --> 00:07:47,940
Rym: What a great day.

111
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,347
Scott: It wasn't the fact that it was yay.

112
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:50,231
Scott: What a great day is that.

113
00:07:50,251 --> 00:07:52,120
Scott: in fact you did an annoying voice.

114
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,347
Rym: I don't think it was that annoying.

115
00:07:53,427 --> 00:07:54,352
Rym: It's pretty annoying.

116
00:07:54,734 --> 00:07:55,740
Scott: It's pretty annoying.

117
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:00,860
Scott: The Sun is singing the birds are shining and you're being loud and it's kind of painful.

118
00:08:02,321 --> 00:08:03,284
Rym: Anyway, okay.

119
00:08:03,304 --> 00:08:06,014
Rym: So what do you have in the news captain Scott?

120
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,820
Scott: Well, you know, we don't watch the television.

121
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:09,964
Scott: Right, no cable.

122
00:08:10,265 --> 00:08:10,947
Scott: No antenna.

123
00:08:11,088 --> 00:08:12,131
Scott: No, no satellites.

124
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:12,632
Scott: No nothing.

125
00:08:12,773 --> 00:08:14,016
Rym: Well, I watch DVDs.

126
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:15,200
Scott: Yeah, but that's not television.

127
00:08:15,723 --> 00:08:19,706
Rym: Well, I watch it on the television and I watch television shows But that isn't television.

128
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:22,800
Scott: television requires the teller in addition to the vision.

129
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,182
Scott: You're just.

130
00:08:23,404 --> 00:08:29,451
Scott: you're sort of watching things that could be Delivered by television, but you're watching them with just the vision.

131
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:32,140
Rym: So if I use a TiVo and timeshift if is it still television?

132
00:08:33,662 --> 00:08:38,745
Rym: No, okay, because you're not watching it via the teller But you are just time shifted.

133
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:41,495
Rym: it came in by the teller if that doesn't matter.

134
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:42,558
Rym: So what matters?

135
00:08:42,578 --> 00:08:43,120
Rym: what's the line?

136
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,811
Scott: The live broad whatever.

137
00:08:45,831 --> 00:08:46,254
Scott: Okay.

138
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,040
Rym: I'm curious.

139
00:08:47,742 --> 00:08:52,740
Scott: The point is we don't watch the television if we don't listen to the radio except sometimes in the car, but rarely right.

140
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:54,288
Rym: I haven't you know, what actually?

141
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:58,274
Rym: I took the antenna out of my car a long time ago So I can't listen to the radio in the car.

142
00:08:58,374 --> 00:09:02,713
Rym: Yeah Cuz that it makes my RF transmitter work a thousand times better.

143
00:09:02,753 --> 00:09:05,337
Scott: Yeah, I have the wire so I don't need to do that but anyway.

144
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:16,680
Scott: So if there's like an emergency like emergency broadcast system emergency Like I don't know a tornado warning or you know, that doesn't happen here often, but it could it could happen.

145
00:09:16,901 --> 00:09:17,805
Rym: Um, yeah, I don't.

146
00:09:17,885 --> 00:09:23,466
Scott: actually now that I think about go on or or maybe uh, you know Something else like that happens, right?

147
00:09:23,586 --> 00:09:24,569
Rym: Cuz there's there's one.

148
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:26,375
Rym: I have a really important anecdote.

149
00:09:26,395 --> 00:09:44,054
Scott: But anyway, yeah, then we Really despite our being high-tech and fancy we won't find out because the emergency broadcast system is pretty much radio and TV and It's based on the assumption that you're going to either have a radio or a TV on pretty soon.

150
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:49,300
Rym: I mean, I remember at RIT when the September 11th attacks happened.

151
00:09:49,782 --> 00:10:16,260
Rym: There was no way any of us would have found out at all until we went and checked the news but because we were all in college and because the odds of at least a Quarter to half of the front row crew being online Actively using the internet at any given point in the day 24/7 seven days a week Like if the odds were pretty much a hundred percent that someone was online like actively searching and surfing whatever.

152
00:10:16,945 --> 00:10:20,772
Rym: So pretty much we had our own FRC emergency broadcast system.

153
00:10:20,872 --> 00:10:22,240
Scott: I mean for something like that.

154
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,084
Scott: It'll work out like.

155
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:26,681
Scott: I got an I am that told me to turn on the TV and we had TV at RIT Cuz.

156
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:39,702
Scott: they had free cable in the apartment, but you know if something happens like I use my tornado warning example No one in the front row crew is gonna find out about that and be able to tell us because they don't have radio or TV either.

157
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,578
Scott: and it's a local problem not a huge problem that you're gonna find out about.

158
00:10:43,618 --> 00:10:48,980
Scott: like, you know Our friends in Albany aren't gonna find out about the beacon tornado warning on the internet.

159
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:49,943
Rym: Yeah, there's not get.

160
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:52,231
Rym: a FARC is not gonna say tornado coming in beacon.

161
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,800
Rym: FARC is going to say tornado destroyed beacon.

162
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,864
Scott: Yes, exactly.

163
00:10:55,944 --> 00:11:05,162
Scott: So where it's sort of kind of, you know, whenever there's like a big storm or something I'll always go to like, you know, always go to like weather websites just to make sure you know Cuz like.

164
00:11:05,563 --> 00:11:15,184
Rym: well the weather example is interesting because the one that's actually the thing I care about the least even though I mean I grew up in Michigan, which is pretty much one of the most tornado in states There is.

165
00:11:15,547 --> 00:11:17,139
Rym: there are a lot of tornadoes.

166
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:22,837
Rym: We get tornadoes came frequently to the point that you hear a tornado warning you go up tornado.

167
00:11:22,857 --> 00:11:25,464
Rym: Ah Sometimes we'd go watch him.

168
00:11:25,544 --> 00:11:26,226
Rym: It was great fun.

169
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:29,294
Rym: But one because there were tornadoes.

170
00:11:29,334 --> 00:11:34,532
Rym: in danger of tornadoes, you know every town There's always like the air raid siren or the loud siren that can.

171
00:11:35,235 --> 00:11:41,280
Rym: it seems like out here Because it seems like they go off kind of randomly and whenever I hear it go off I think tornado.

172
00:11:41,882 --> 00:11:49,280
Rym: Because in Michigan it goes off once a month to test and otherwise it goes off when there's a tornado warning.

173
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,654
Rym: So there's no way you can miss the fact that there's a tornado in the area.

174
00:11:52,674 --> 00:11:55,047
Rym: Mmm, but around here They don't seem to do that.

175
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,700
Rym: So what's the point of the stupid siren?

176
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,728
Scott: They use them here for like fires and they.

177
00:11:59,748 --> 00:12:00,610
Rym: that doesn't help me.

178
00:12:00,631 --> 00:12:04,000
Scott: It helps the volunteer fire department pagers.

179
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:05,466
Scott: They might not have the pager on.

180
00:12:05,486 --> 00:12:06,209
Rym: Yes, they do.

181
00:12:06,229 --> 00:12:08,680
Rym: I know volunteer firemen always carry their pager.

182
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:13,780
Rym: They want that pager to go off, you know how awesome it is when that pager goes off.

183
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:14,784
Scott: They also.

184
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,536
Scott: they also use it in case the nuclear power plant has a problem.

185
00:12:17,556 --> 00:12:18,340
Rym: That's a different one.

186
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:29,278
Rym: I remember we had there's one siren that's like And then there's this other siren that's like in the distance and I never knew what that other one was.

187
00:12:29,318 --> 00:12:30,785
Rym: then we found out That's Indian point.

188
00:12:31,047 --> 00:12:32,857
Rym: Yeah, if Indian point blows up.

189
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:33,199
Rym: We'll hear.

190
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:38,970
Scott: Anyway, of course, no one will know what it is, right?

191
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,960
Scott: We will tell the emergency broadcast system turns up anyway You know what?

192
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,721
Rym: That is that's the.

193
00:12:42,822 --> 00:12:44,744
Rym: well, let's start driving north alarm.

194
00:12:44,784 --> 00:12:44,904
Rym: So

195
00:12:44,924 --> 00:13:03,133
Scott: this is really you know, and it's funny, you know that as connected as we are probably the you know, the most important thing we don't get and it's because Being so connected and smart we pull our information, you know We don't have people pushing information at us that we don't want.

196
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:08,060
Scott: we go and handpick what we want But by hand picking there we're gonna miss something.

197
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,227
Rym: It's also kind of that we only connect to.

198
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:14,140
Rym: I guess usable or you know, well put together information sources.

199
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:27,814
Rym: so the same problem here is also why we don't often have a lot of Knowledge about local events because there's no modern way to find out about local events and it's not worth the effort To use the old archaic methods like the terrible local papers we have right

200
00:13:28,376 --> 00:13:31,066
Scott: but something Like an emergency broadcast you.

201
00:13:31,306 --> 00:13:35,240
Scott: the goal is to push that to everyone and it makes sense because everyone wants it.

202
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,707
Scott: No, there's no one who doesn't want the emergency broadcast Right.

203
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,654
Scott: So what do we do?

204
00:13:39,714 --> 00:13:42,525
Scott: and Surprise surprise of all things.

205
00:13:42,646 --> 00:13:43,348
Scott: It's amazing.

206
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:53,931
Scott: the government the federal government the United States specifically the FCC Which is stupid in so many ways Actually has a smart answer and they're gonna make it happen.

207
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:54,713
Scott: I can't believe it.

208
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,980
Scott: It's tax dollars doing right.

209
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,717
Rym: See, this is why we are libertarians with a lower fucking case L. Yeah lowercase.

210
00:14:02,877 --> 00:14:03,800
Rym: That's very yeah.

211
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,239
Scott: This is not police or courts or defense Alright, this is something else.

212
00:14:08,763 --> 00:14:13,247
Scott: But you know those crazy libertarians would say, you know This is the kind of thing that they wouldn't budget for.

213
00:14:13,308 --> 00:14:13,950
Rym: you want a school.

214
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,500
Rym: you'll pay for your own goddamn school, right?

215
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,280
Scott: Anyway, yeah, if you don't have the school, how are the people gonna understand the emergency broadcast?

216
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:32,556
Scott: Basically what they're gonna do is they're gonna have a thing where They send out SMS messages on your cell phone where there's an emergency.

217
00:14:32,636 --> 00:14:35,898
Rym: That's brilliant because Everyone has a cell phone.

218
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:37,122
Scott: Yeah Pretty mighty.

219
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:42,523
Scott: well least anyone who doesn't watch TV and doesn't listen to the radio has a cell phone Pretty much.

220
00:14:42,563 --> 00:14:47,279
Rym: the only exception are homeless people who well homeless people and Luddites are screwed anyway.

221
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,479
Rym: That's what I was gonna say.

222
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:49,402
Scott: nothing.

223
00:14:49,703 --> 00:15:01,215
Rym: not homeless people hobos because there's a difference between I mean homeless person is a large category and then independent of homeless person There's the transiently homeless and then there are hobos and then there are bombs.

224
00:15:01,717 --> 00:15:02,620
Rym: all the different but anyway.

225
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:08,118
Scott: but anyway the point is is that it really depends on how this is implemented how quality it is.

226
00:15:08,138 --> 00:15:11,940
Scott: because I mean Like if they go by say area code, right?

227
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,437
Scott: I'm gonna get emergencies for like Connecticut and I'm gonna get emergencies for Poughkeepsie, right?

228
00:15:16,477 --> 00:15:17,260
Scott: That's not so good.

229
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,223
Scott: We want the beacon ones.

230
00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:22,900
Scott: if they go by GPS, which is what they should do then this could be awesome.

231
00:15:24,002 --> 00:15:25,891
Rym: That without that makes it like the best thing ever.

232
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,072
Rym: cuz.

233
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:30,455
Rym: then if I'm on a business trip in in Florida and Florida is about to blow up.

234
00:15:30,515 --> 00:15:31,300
Rym: I'll get a hurricane.

235
00:15:31,842 --> 00:15:39,184
Scott: You'll get an SMS while you're in Florida saying hurricane get the hell out of Florida with hurricanes You know, they're coming a long time in advance I know I know.

236
00:15:39,224 --> 00:15:48,579
Scott: but plus the other thing about you know The SMS is you can actually give detailed Instructions that are sort of written down that people can look at and read and look at and read again.

237
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:57,780
Scott: So they won't mess them up and say, you know having to write down You know what the emergency broadcast on the radio is saying, you know or write down where the TV is saying or cop.

238
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,279
Scott: You know, you'll have it and you'll be able to take the information with you.

239
00:16:00,621 --> 00:16:05,959
Scott: So as you're evacuating you can read the evacuation directions on the phone that came in the SMS message.

240
00:16:06,622 --> 00:16:11,440
Rym: No, the thing is though the example about weather doesn't really I can't say I care about that.

241
00:16:11,661 --> 00:16:15,140
Scott: No, I'm just saying weather is the really good example because it's something that's localized.

242
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:23,375
Rym: Yeah but at the same time I just want to point out that for the majority of the United States where There is a possibility of tornadoes and dangerous weather like that.

243
00:16:23,977 --> 00:16:28,813
Rym: It's actually The conditions are very specific and you can pretty much.

244
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:29,677
Rym: I'd like to do a little.

245
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,580
Rym: maybe I'll do a little like quick.

246
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,500
Scott: You can tell when they're coming without a brush.

247
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:39,180
Rym: You can know pretty much all day if it's a tornado day and you'll know long before a tornado comes if tornadoes are coming.

248
00:16:39,321 --> 00:16:41,820
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but I think this is a really good idea.

249
00:16:41,981 --> 00:16:42,463
Scott: It would make.

250
00:16:42,523 --> 00:16:44,994
Scott: it makes me pretty happy to know that you know.

251
00:16:45,356 --> 00:16:47,685
Scott: sometime in the future I won't have to worry about.

252
00:16:47,705 --> 00:16:51,380
Scott: I wonder if there's an emergency broadcast and I'm missing it because I'm too high.

253
00:16:51,884 --> 00:17:01,391
Rym: the worst thing is whenever like Whenever there's a problem like the internet goes down or on my cell phone Stop working like the power goes out and doesn't come back on right away.

254
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:06,244
Rym: We are we always look at each other and go is There's something going on?

255
00:17:06,265 --> 00:17:07,691
Rym: because there's no way for us to know?

256
00:17:07,711 --> 00:17:09,659
Scott: it's knowing for us to know no way at all.

257
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,388
Scott: But now they'll be like for us to know.

258
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:13,380
Rym: remember the great Northeast power outage.

259
00:17:13,882 --> 00:17:14,184
Rym: Remember?

260
00:17:14,263 --> 00:17:16,796
Rym: I called Scott on my cell phone and I was like, yeah.

261
00:17:17,117 --> 00:17:20,876
Rym: Oh my god I'm an IBM the powers using the landline phone in Connecticut.

262
00:17:21,198 --> 00:17:23,946
Rym: Oh, yeah I forget exactly what the conversation is like.

263
00:17:24,268 --> 00:17:25,973
Rym: Hey is the power out where you are?

264
00:17:26,054 --> 00:17:30,759
Rym: Hahaha, and then Scott was like, yeah Yeah, I was like, uh Really?

265
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,509
Rym: powers out here - shit.

266
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:37,758
Rym: And my co-workers are like what's going on?

267
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:42,600
Rym: Oh shit in the factory is going berserk because you know, it's a factory that suddenly lost power.

268
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,564
Scott: Just got home.

269
00:17:44,006 --> 00:17:45,694
Scott: I did generators at the factory.

270
00:17:45,735 --> 00:17:48,564
Rym: Yes, but this It was crazy.

271
00:17:48,604 --> 00:17:49,587
Rym: I'll put it that way.

272
00:17:49,627 --> 00:17:51,735
Scott: Anyway, so you got a news over there.

273
00:17:52,116 --> 00:17:52,859
Rym: I got a news.

274
00:17:52,959 --> 00:18:00,927
Rym: indeed This is something that I have very very conflicted feelings about not just this news But the issue in general.

275
00:18:01,229 --> 00:18:14,166
Rym: and of course, I want to point out that this Like most things that I am interested in Involves my favorite US Circuit Court of Appeals number nine number nine Number nine.

276
00:18:14,306 --> 00:18:16,272
Rym: the ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals.

277
00:18:16,293 --> 00:18:18,580
Scott: to take that, you know, that's long love potion number nine.

278
00:18:19,161 --> 00:18:24,485
Scott: We should remix it to be like, oh, oh, oh number nine Anyway, that wrong song.

279
00:18:24,545 --> 00:18:26,832
Rym: I know I was thinking like table five though different thing cuz.

280
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:27,514
Rym: it's also funny.

281
00:18:27,876 --> 00:18:29,300
Scott: You didn't even sound right.

282
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:30,183
Rym: I can't sing.

283
00:18:30,203 --> 00:18:34,939
Scott: It's gotta be like oh, oh, oh, oh table nine table nine.

284
00:18:35,421 --> 00:18:36,245
Scott: I was like that.

285
00:18:36,688 --> 00:18:38,276
Rym: you gave me crap when I tried to sing.

286
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:39,000
Rym: those were the days.

287
00:18:39,141 --> 00:18:41,340
Rym: So I guess you can't really expect anything better.

288
00:18:42,182 --> 00:18:49,200
Rym: But the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the US is pretty much the most overturned court in the world.

289
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,385
Scott: It's in San Francisco.

290
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:51,409
Scott: It's a bunch of hippies.

291
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:59,679
Scott: They basically say yeah, that's on the constitutional Whatever they don't like and then it always gets sent to a higher court that says all right or no?

292
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:01,026
Scott: No, you crazy thing.

293
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:02,052
Rym: is this courts important?

294
00:19:02,092 --> 00:19:03,340
Scott: because it is important.

295
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,865
Rym: They're the court that kind of.

296
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:14,600
Rym: they're almost a bellwether in some ways and a lot of times an issue that otherwise is just set In stone, they'll be the ones who instigate kind of a reevaluation of the situation.

297
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:25,943
Scott: Yeah, I also think that there are a lot of people like when they have a case, you know Like they'll purposely file their case where they know they'll get to this court, you know when it's in when it's like a constitutional issue They want to make.

298
00:19:26,727 --> 00:19:29,080
Rym: but I'm this is a very short AP wire thing.

299
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,287
Rym: I'm just gonna read it verbatim and then we can discuss it.

300
00:19:31,488 --> 00:19:35,340
Rym: All right quote a federal appeals court in San Francisco.

301
00:19:36,183 --> 00:19:37,911
Rym: Whatever an article starts that way I go.

302
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,920
Rym: Oh man here comes overturned.

303
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:52,580
Rym: What a law says that a website can be found liable for violating fair housing laws by matching Roommates according to gender sexual orientation and whether or not they have children.

304
00:19:53,564 --> 00:20:07,300
Rym: Well on Thursday the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals Decided that roommates.com could be brought to trial for possibly violating Anti-discrimination laws because it asks users to give detailed information to screen participants for matches.

305
00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:14,160
Rym: The court says federal law protecting websites quotes was not meant to create a lawless no-man's land on the internet end quote.

306
00:20:14,762 --> 00:20:19,500
Rym: The ruling deals a major blow to the immunity shield that federal law is provided to the Internet.

307
00:20:21,323 --> 00:20:25,308
Scott: Well, I have to read the opinion of the court to know I'm not even gonna talk about.

308
00:20:25,328 --> 00:20:27,420
Scott: the court know what their law basis.

309
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:47,099
Rym: There are federal laws that basically say if you're like the Fair Housing Act and all these things if you were Advertising housing you cannot advertise based on certain requirements Yep, and if you are like seeking housing for other people, you cannot allow them to give you certain parameters.

310
00:20:47,139 --> 00:20:50,462
Rym: to look yep, and I Don't know.

311
00:20:50,622 --> 00:20:57,297
Rym: I mean, I still don't know how I feel about these things because on one hand Obviously, there are very important applications for this.

312
00:20:57,317 --> 00:21:03,101
Rym: you I don't think you should be able to have a website or have a realtor where you can say All right.

313
00:21:03,322 --> 00:21:06,110
Rym: I want to rent my house out, but no blackies.

314
00:21:06,651 --> 00:21:09,539
Rym: No, no whitey's no brownies.

315
00:21:10,082 --> 00:21:12,499
Scott: No, yellowy's no orangey's only greenies.

316
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:21,254
Rym: but at the same time Say I live in New York City and I have a one bedroom or a studio apartment and I need a roommate.

317
00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:26,999
Rym: I Don't feel comfortable just having some guy I don't know live with me.

318
00:21:27,601 --> 00:21:31,911
Rym: I think it should be okay for me to advertise or just another woman

319
00:21:32,453 --> 00:21:49,102
Scott: or what if I am a Crazy Hasidic Jew, right, you know, even if I wouldn't mind, you know Like living with some you know, non type of you know, Hasidic Jew at least in principle, you know Like.

320
00:21:49,363 --> 00:21:53,240
Scott: there would be serious problems if like they were messing up my kosher action.

321
00:21:53,922 --> 00:21:54,926
Scott: So should you know.

322
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,575
Scott: but I need a roommate because I can't afford to live there.

323
00:21:57,936 --> 00:22:02,370
Rym: while you can have these Anti-discrimination things in place to you know prevent people from screening.

324
00:22:03,032 --> 00:22:16,539
Rym: you can't second-guess someone's motivation And if I just happen to only let the one woman who applies be my roommate and I reject the other hundred men And I don't say anything How are they gonna prove that I was?

325
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:17,805
Rym: Violating this?

326
00:22:17,865 --> 00:22:19,358
Scott: I mean it had lots of lawyers.

327
00:22:20,145 --> 00:22:31,799
Rym: But I guess in the end I feel like if I if someone wants to find a roommate that in the end they should be able to for their own personal personal space.

328
00:22:32,982 --> 00:22:36,520
Rym: They can pretty much decide based on whatever parameters they want.

329
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:49,980
Rym: Yeah, and even though this allows a lot of people to be racist or homophobic or horrible in all sorts of ways at the same time It's I mean you're gonna force the the KKK guy to move in with the black guy.

330
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,627
Scott: That's not gonna work out.

331
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,459
Scott: He probably wouldn't I know but I'm saying it's like you're good.

332
00:22:55,002 --> 00:22:56,469
Rym: But I guess I in this specific case.

333
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:58,619
Rym: I feel like a site like roommates calm.

334
00:23:00,522 --> 00:23:03,234
Rym: I almost feel like they should allow you to look at like.

335
00:23:03,254 --> 00:23:05,364
Rym: if you put in the information It should be optional.

336
00:23:05,444 --> 00:23:08,980
Rym: you could say I would like to put in this information or not and it should be optional.

337
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:15,951
Rym: I would like to search for this information or not, but like kids say I'm but then again There's also discrimination about say I have it out.

338
00:23:16,454 --> 00:23:21,089
Rym: I rent out a little house Alright, what if I don't want the gays to move in?

339
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:25,640
Rym: so I say only available to families now that could be discriminatory.

340
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,236
Rym: But at the same time what if I don't want loud punk kids to live?

341
00:23:29,477 --> 00:23:30,160
Rym: it's complicated.

342
00:23:30,562 --> 00:23:33,740
Scott: Yeah, if you're quiet old people and you don't want punk kids to live in there?

343
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:43,120
Scott: I mean on the one hand it's sort of like yeah, but on the other hand But I see even forget about the discrimination right forget about all the discrimination parts of this issue, okay?

344
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:51,000
Scott: What if roommates calm just move their servers to like Canada, but so the service they provide isn't you know?

345
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:57,380
Scott: It's like people from the US could go to the Canadian website, you know and fill and find housing in the US.

346
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,625
Scott: It's just it could be anywhere.

347
00:23:58,766 --> 00:23:59,248
Rym: Well, you know what.

348
00:23:59,268 --> 00:23:59,549
Rym: you know what.

349
00:23:59,589 --> 00:24:02,040
Rym: that is the answer to this problem.

350
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,625
Scott: well, I know.

351
00:24:02,686 --> 00:24:05,713
Scott: but the thing is right is the US?

352
00:24:06,803 --> 00:24:11,520
Scott: Why even bother making a law that can be so easily?

353
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,626
Scott: Evaded it's like you know.

354
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:20,085
Scott: if you're gonna make a law, you know, even if the law is is right in principle Right.

355
00:24:20,105 --> 00:24:21,399
Scott: Let's say you have a law that's right.

356
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:24,556
Scott: Well, I've got a that we agree with a hundred percent that that should be the law.

357
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,759
Rym: if it's not in front Well, there's no point in having the law, right?

358
00:24:27,923 --> 00:24:29,188
Rym: I want to even say something further.

359
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:35,520
Rym: a law up like this at least for individuals All it does it doesn't really end discrimination.

360
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:43,551
Rym: It pushes the discrimination one step closer to the person where instead of like alright, they can't discriminate in the search They'll just discriminate in the decision instead.

361
00:24:43,852 --> 00:24:45,519
Rym: It's like it doesn't really accomplish anything.

362
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:52,400
Rym: now I want to qualify all of this by saying that I think these laws are very important for say large organizations.

363
00:24:52,621 --> 00:24:58,480
Rym: I feel like laws like this should not apply to individuals, but they should apply to like an apartment building.

364
00:24:58,567 --> 00:25:07,799
Rym: Yeah Exactly apartment building should not be able to discriminate on pretty much anything other than we're like Yes, do you have the money you can live here?

365
00:25:08,363 --> 00:25:15,095
Rym: But if I own my house Like there should be kind of for all laws like this like the ADA and everything There should be a line.

366
00:25:15,115 --> 00:25:23,130
Rym: in the ADA There are lines but below which like if your company has two employees You shouldn't have to like fully comply with all these laws.

367
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:27,865
Rym: if I have a tiny like attic apartment in my house I want to rent out.

368
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:32,687
Rym: I shouldn't have to comply with these laws, but Me and rims start GeekNights the company.

369
00:25:32,988 --> 00:25:37,260
Scott: Do we really need workers comp shit in case the Rym like hurts himself and falls out?

370
00:25:38,394 --> 00:25:45,587
Scott: Really Me and rims started a company.

371
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:49,240
Scott: can I claim disability thus bankrupting Rym and living a life of luxury?

372
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:54,519
Rym: So, uh and no work, I guess in the end I'm conflicted about this issue on a number of levels.

373
00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:10,971
Rym: but from the technological geek standpoint this law and this lawsuit are so easily circum circumvented that it like it's laughable to the point that Roommates.com Regardless of anything just move your servers to Canada.

374
00:26:11,011 --> 00:26:13,500
Scott: It's like making a law that says don't look at the sky.

375
00:26:13,882 --> 00:26:16,234
Scott: It's like there's no way that you can stop.

376
00:26:16,415 --> 00:26:20,840
Scott: I'm not looking at the sky I'm looking at that bird, but there's no way you can enforce the law that says don't look at the sky.

377
00:26:20,941 --> 00:26:21,726
Rym: So, yes, you can.

378
00:26:21,867 --> 00:26:23,780
Rym: if yes, you could how good you all right?

379
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,469
Rym: Well, one way is you have you.

380
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,399
Rym: you hire a policeman to follow everyone around?

381
00:26:28,981 --> 00:26:30,548
Rym: But then who watches the Watchman's you gotta have.

382
00:26:30,568 --> 00:26:40,620
Rym: someone follows policemen around or you just put Gigantic Eyeball destroying lasers in the sky, but I look for eyeballs and shoot them.

383
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,707
Scott: Anyway, you know it stop being silly.

384
00:26:42,887 --> 00:26:44,372
Rym: The point is not that silly.

385
00:26:44,513 --> 00:26:45,175
Scott: I open it.

386
00:26:45,215 --> 00:26:46,620
Scott: The law is don't look at the sky.

387
00:26:47,802 --> 00:26:49,739
Scott: Why even if it's you know?

388
00:26:50,081 --> 00:26:55,200
Scott: You really people looking at the sky is a bad thing and we all agree that people looking at the sky is a bad thing.

389
00:26:55,721 --> 00:26:57,406
Scott: It's impossible to stop people.

390
00:26:57,466 --> 00:27:00,554
Scott: So why waste our resources and time trying?

391
00:27:00,955 --> 00:27:05,486
Rym: it's kind of like how with prohibition Don't make laws to stop people from drinking.

392
00:27:05,526 --> 00:27:06,348
Rym: People are gonna drink.

393
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:07,952
Rym: people are gonna drink.

394
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,859
Rym: people drank completely all through prohibition before it.

395
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,540
Rym: after Nothing changed, but beer baron, but the laws caused a lot of problems.

396
00:27:15,841 --> 00:27:21,959
Rym: So don't make the drinking illegal because that doesn't really work, but it's still illegal if you hit someone with your car.

397
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:31,167
Rym: Yep things of the day now.

398
00:27:31,648 --> 00:27:35,193
Rym: the previous three days were not really cop-outs but pretty much.

399
00:27:35,674 --> 00:27:45,710
Rym: this has been my thing of the day all week because I really wanted to bring this up and I figured that Since this thing is so cool in my opinion What better way than to just kind of build up to it?

400
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,910
Scott: Because actually I think my thing of the day today is better.

401
00:27:48,211 --> 00:27:51,402
Rym: Thing of the day came out of nowhere and it's like fucking amazing.

402
00:27:51,422 --> 00:27:58,910
Rym: Don't get me wrong Scott's thing of the day Fucking is made of wind, but my thing of the day is somewhat poignant.

403
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,420
Rym: Now all week I've been talking about this song.

404
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:13,345
Rym: those were the days that was a Super like pop success all over the world at least in the Western world And it had ties to like the birds and Paul McCartney and all these things.

405
00:28:13,406 --> 00:28:16,575
Rym: It was based on this old Russian folk song.

406
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:17,980
Scott: people have heard this story three times.

407
00:28:18,462 --> 00:28:21,513
Rym: Yeah, but actually a lot of people only listen to Thursday That's it.

408
00:28:21,573 --> 00:28:25,090
Rym: And a lot of people only listen to Wednesday and a lot of people only listen to Tuesday.

409
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:26,149
Rym: I think you see where I'm going with this.

410
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:42,670
Rym: yeah, but the deal is it all kind of comes full circle because this song which was originally a Russian folk song and then was kind of translated into a pop a pop song and then Was kind of covered in modern eras by a Norwegian finish or die.

411
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:56,336
Rym: There was a Dutch band comes full circle and was performed kind of epically by the Leningrad cowboys Which I point out is a Finnish band was close to the Dutch band So that that's a tiny link there.

412
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:04,270
Rym: this Finnish band performed this song in conjunction With the Soviet red star red army chorus.

413
00:29:04,431 --> 00:29:13,025
Rym: It's a grim favorite that that band is one of my favorite bands ever and they actually Collaborate often with the Leningrad cowboys, which is also one of my favorite bands.

414
00:29:13,386 --> 00:29:26,910
Rym: So this concert This is filmed live is the red star red army chorus singing Those were the days which is a pop song that was based on a Russian folk song with the Leningrad cowboys a Finnish pop band.

415
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:28,656
Rym: That their hair is awesome.

416
00:29:28,696 --> 00:29:29,921
Rym: If nothing else, they kind of have that.

417
00:29:30,222 --> 00:29:32,610
Scott: they have that sort of crow Marti hair.

418
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:38,274
Scott: Oh, they're sticking out that guy from the movie the Kamikaze girls.

419
00:29:38,474 --> 00:29:39,417
Rym: Oh, yeah that guy.

420
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:39,838
Scott: Yeah.

421
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:41,864
Scott: I heard that's like goes way forward.

422
00:29:42,246 --> 00:29:42,888
Rym: I love that hair.

423
00:29:42,928 --> 00:29:43,710
Rym: I love those guys.

424
00:29:44,072 --> 00:29:47,870
Scott: I I like the look at that hair, but I would never have that hair.

425
00:29:48,796 --> 00:29:50,267
Rym: I'd be afraid I'd like hit someone with it.

426
00:29:50,469 --> 00:29:51,024
Scott: Yeah I don't know

427
00:29:51,411 --> 00:30:13,129
Rym: but the thing that I find really interesting is that one is this song kind of came full circle from Russian poem to Russian folk song to popular song in the West to popular song moving back toward Europe and then finally The red star red army chorus with this like super not serious Leningrad cowboys band.

428
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:34,810
Rym: But if you look at it even further the song the gist of the song both in English and in Russian is kind of this nostalgia for the past and this kind of transition and The song being performed by these two groups Especially because this was this concert was actually not too long after The fall of the Soviet Union and the you know, the opening up at the end of the Cold War.

429
00:30:35,635 --> 00:30:48,437
Rym: the song is really kind of poignant and Seeing the red star chorus performing alongside a band like this in the post-soviet world and the fact that the song Itself is so kind of meaningful.

430
00:30:48,457 --> 00:30:49,219
Rym: There's a lot there.

431
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,887
Rym: And also this concert is fucking epic and I would have loved to have been there All right.

432
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:56,259
Scott: So check this story out right?

433
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:58,690
Scott: is one of the guys who writes for Kotaku?

434
00:30:58,791 --> 00:31:03,260
Scott: He puts up a post and he's like is Transformers still good right?

435
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:04,868
Scott: and he's sort of referring to you.

436
00:31:04,888 --> 00:31:05,370
Scott: We all know it.

437
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:09,415
Scott: Well, you know you like transformers as a kid You like he-man as a kid.

438
00:31:09,715 --> 00:31:13,307
Scott: you go back and watch it now that you're older and you go.

439
00:31:13,487 --> 00:31:14,390
Rym: Oh, it's bad.

440
00:31:14,913 --> 00:31:15,437
Scott: Oh, it's bad.

441
00:31:15,477 --> 00:31:23,790
Scott: So I basically said yeah Transformers it holds up better than he-man but doesn't hold up as well as Voltron and Thundercats, which is true.

442
00:31:24,151 --> 00:31:26,742
Rym: Yeah, I mean as much as I like the Transformers movie.

443
00:31:27,224 --> 00:31:32,119
Rym: I tried to watch it again actually Me and I think yeah God this was way back.

444
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:44,026
Rym: instead of doing work for projects like me and I do just sat and watched the Transformers movie all night in college and I can say one thing That movie is spastic and ADD and you can't even tell what's going on.

445
00:31:44,307 --> 00:31:47,277
Rym: I know what's going on Yeah, but like though you can barely tell.

446
00:31:47,297 --> 00:31:51,690
Scott: but anyway, you know some of the Transformers TV series kind of okay some not.

447
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:55,408
Scott: But anyway, he posted up another post that was like, yeah, it didn't hold up.

448
00:31:55,468 --> 00:31:56,572
Scott: so well What was I thinking?

449
00:31:57,114 --> 00:32:02,350
Scott: and in the comments of that post someone put some links to some videos and thus the thing of the day.

450
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,860
Scott: There's a guy named Dr.

451
00:32:05,042 --> 00:32:14,642
Scott: Smoove D R S M O O V and he has the YouTube account and on his YouTube account he puts the videos and basically what he does in these videos.

452
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:21,183
Scott: what he does in these videos is he takes GI Joe and transformers primarily but also some other things.

453
00:32:21,243 --> 00:32:23,370
Scott: I guess I've only watched one of these videos so far.

454
00:32:23,511 --> 00:32:44,030
Scott: I'm assuming the rest are just as good and He edits them and redubs them and he actually is a really good voice actor like for a second like at first I Thought it was the original Transformers voice actors like you know having fun sort of like those Thundercats outtakes which are the Thundercats voice actors having fun.

455
00:32:44,531 --> 00:32:45,555
Scott: But no he really does.

456
00:32:45,575 --> 00:32:52,070
Scott: he just does a really good shockwave a really good Megatron and a really good Starscream and a really good optimus prime.

457
00:32:52,392 --> 00:32:58,558
Rym: I don't think there's any way to overstate how Absolutely perfect and hilarious.

458
00:32:58,598 --> 00:33:00,203
Rym: This is so he redubs.

459
00:33:00,584 --> 00:33:09,589
Scott: They sort of these clips and It sort of makes more sense the original show and is actually funny and cool and awesome.

460
00:33:09,649 --> 00:33:17,863
Rym: now the defining moment when Scott showed this to me was when Someone shows up, and there's there's our friend our man.

461
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:20,010
Rym: shockwave the best transform.

462
00:33:20,111 --> 00:33:20,775
Scott: Let me tell you about.

463
00:33:21,016 --> 00:33:22,083
Scott: let me tell you about shockwave.

464
00:33:22,143 --> 00:33:28,855
Scott: right the story of Transformers in brief at least the beginning of transformers is you have these transformers They're on Cybertron.

465
00:33:29,116 --> 00:33:30,684
Scott: Autobots are good decepticons are bad.

466
00:33:30,724 --> 00:33:33,314
Scott: They fight, okay They leave for Earth.

467
00:33:33,394 --> 00:33:34,257
Scott: released a bunch of them.

468
00:33:34,297 --> 00:33:34,939
Scott: leave for Earth.

469
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,810
Scott: the decepticons are still sort of in charge of Cybertron, right?

470
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:42,720
Scott: So Megatron the leader of the decepticons he went to Earth all right.

471
00:33:43,542 --> 00:33:45,347
Scott: He said shockwave you stay here.

472
00:33:45,388 --> 00:33:46,110
Scott: You're in charge.

473
00:33:46,732 --> 00:33:51,494
Scott: Shockwave is like the most powerful fucking normal-sized Transformer.

474
00:33:51,534 --> 00:33:53,663
Scott: you know not counting things like Unicron and whatnot.

475
00:33:54,225 --> 00:33:55,410
Scott: he turns into a laser gun.

476
00:33:55,470 --> 00:34:01,470
Scott: I mean Megatron turns into like a handgun, but shockwave turns into a laser gun like the wicked laser gun.

477
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:05,070
Scott: He can like blow shit up crazy, but he's super loyal to Megatron.

478
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:10,185
Scott: So he doesn't you know fuck around Megatron was just so in confidence the opposite of Starscream like he's.

479
00:34:10,485 --> 00:34:13,797
Scott: Starscream is super smart But he's an asshole.

480
00:34:13,837 --> 00:34:15,884
Scott: He's super disloyal asshole.

481
00:34:16,105 --> 00:34:22,770
Scott: Who's weak, but Shockwave is a super strong super smart not asshole.

482
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:23,452
Scott: Who's loyal?

483
00:34:23,493 --> 00:34:28,530
Scott: and that's why he's able to rate maintain control of Cybertron for four million years.

484
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:29,757
Scott: You know what you know what.

485
00:34:29,938 --> 00:34:31,530
Rym: in a way shockwave?

486
00:34:32,451 --> 00:34:36,889
Rym: And and it's kind of like the Justinian Belisarius relationship, right?

487
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:50,779
Scott: But basically it's shockwave is on Cybertron bored and all Super alone for four million years plus and then suddenly like Megatron wakes up and starts taught and you know Contacts him like four million years later and whatnot.

488
00:34:50,819 --> 00:34:54,650
Scott: but it's it's the video that we watch.

489
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,737
Rym: Shockwave answer the phone.

490
00:34:55,757 --> 00:34:56,822
Rym: There's nothing to do up there.

491
00:34:56,864 --> 00:34:57,870
Rym: What do you yeah?

492
00:34:58,930 --> 00:34:59,793
Scott: We're watching this.

493
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:02,601
Scott: the what the one video dr.

494
00:35:02,641 --> 00:35:05,750
Scott: Smoove made that was really funny with shockwaves burden.

495
00:35:05,851 --> 00:35:12,030
Scott: I haven't watched the other ones yet But I must assume that they are all as awesome if not more awesome.

496
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:18,450
Rym: The uh, the defining moment for me was just when the line of don't worry shockwave can't shoot for shit.

497
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,099
Rym: He's like the worst shot in the world is.

498
00:35:20,521 --> 00:35:33,895
Scott: but yeah, I'm gonna link you to dr Smoove's YouTube page so you can watch all his videos But the one that we actually watched so far that was the highest quality is shockwaves burden and it's funnier the more you know about Transformers.

499
00:35:33,936 --> 00:35:35,770
Scott: that's why I tried to tell you the story of shockwave.

500
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:46,470
Scott: But yeah the the if you like if you have nostalgia for Transformers or GI Joe just watch these videos instead of watching the real deal and you'll be much better off.

501
00:35:46,731 --> 00:35:48,698
Rym: Yes, and while the juggernaut is hilarious.

502
00:35:48,718 --> 00:35:50,023
Rym: These are so much better done.

503
00:35:50,063 --> 00:35:51,810
Scott: Yeah, this is better than the juggernaut bitch.

504
00:35:52,292 --> 00:35:56,026
Scott: It's in the same sort of I guess camp, but it's better.

505
00:35:56,788 --> 00:36:04,143
Rym: Of course We found that juggernaut bitch did not lose its A few like months ago like a month or two ago.

506
00:36:04,183 --> 00:36:05,528
Scott: We watched juggernaut.

507
00:36:05,549 --> 00:36:08,757
Scott: bitch Was still really funny.

508
00:36:08,797 --> 00:36:10,746
Rym: Hey got you with my pimp cane.

509
00:36:10,766 --> 00:36:17,394
Rym: Oh Okay Fuck is this shit?

510
00:36:17,614 --> 00:36:18,737
Scott: What the fuck is this shit Charles?

511
00:36:18,918 --> 00:36:19,158
Rym: Okay.

512
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:20,442
Scott: Anyway, hey miss Charles anus.

513
00:36:20,462 --> 00:36:20,903
Rym: Hey, miss.

514
00:36:21,204 --> 00:36:21,585
Scott: Hey, miss.

515
00:36:22,186 --> 00:36:24,558
Rym: Okay, that's enough of that No more.

516
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:25,021
Scott: No more.

517
00:36:25,464 --> 00:36:26,230
Rym: Whoa, okay.

518
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:32,270
Rym: so Well, this came up in the forum a while ago and I I came up with it.

519
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:37,477
Rym: yes, and you know what it generated a lot of interesting discussion and We're kind of lazy.

520
00:36:37,497 --> 00:36:40,010
Rym: if you couldn't tell yesterday's show was kind of a total cop-out.

521
00:36:40,151 --> 00:36:43,025
Rym: So what better way to end the week than to cop out again?

522
00:36:43,045 --> 00:36:46,477
Rym: Oh, man Double cop-out double kappa.

523
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:48,244
Rym: So what are we doing the show on?

524
00:36:48,264 --> 00:36:49,890
Scott: All right, what are we doing this?

525
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:54,710
Scott: I said you could decide we're doing the what if you were a blank and Rym is gonna fill in the blank.

526
00:36:54,890 --> 00:37:01,628
Rym: Well, I think we're gonna have to go straight away with what would I do if I were a super villain?

527
00:37:03,151 --> 00:37:06,305
Scott: Okay, I'd probably actually take over the world and no one would fuck with me.

528
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:07,470
Rym: Well, that's easy.

529
00:37:07,671 --> 00:37:09,982
Rym: Yeah, but how I mean super?

530
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,450
Scott: well, what's my superpower?

531
00:37:13,214 --> 00:37:13,939
Scott: See here's the thing.

532
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:19,054
Scott: first I got to start off right people They say superpower.

533
00:37:19,074 --> 00:37:20,659
Scott: that like there was a discussion.

534
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:24,229
Scott: I read somewhere that was like what's the lamest superpower?

535
00:37:24,249 --> 00:37:28,365
Scott: and I'm like If a power is lame, it's not super.

536
00:37:28,927 --> 00:37:29,670
Rym: right just a power.

537
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:33,597
Rym: There's no power and you have a power.

538
00:37:33,617 --> 00:37:35,804
Scott: it's like make eggs appear out of thin air.

539
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,590
Scott: that could be cool and useful and funny.

540
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:38,809
Scott: It's not super.

541
00:37:39,452 --> 00:37:40,635
Rym: Okay, I don't know.

542
00:37:40,655 --> 00:37:41,438
Rym: I don't know.

543
00:37:41,638 --> 00:37:41,959
Rym: you get it.

544
00:37:41,979 --> 00:37:44,126
Rym: You get a million dollars for one by having it.

545
00:37:44,226 --> 00:37:46,352
Rym: it is any power Includes.

546
00:37:46,613 --> 00:37:47,474
Rym: get a million dollars.

547
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,757
Scott: any supernatural power.

548
00:37:48,817 --> 00:37:52,686
Scott: I could have a natural power like what just jump five feet in the air.

549
00:37:52,706 --> 00:37:55,474
Rym: Ah That logic.

550
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,000
Rym: everyone has a lot of powers.

551
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,124
Rym: They're just really really weak.

552
00:37:58,164 --> 00:37:59,570
Rym: I mean look well, no, they're not weak.

553
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,576
Scott: They're stronger than most animals.

554
00:38:01,716 --> 00:38:02,720
Scott: other animals powers.

555
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,946
Scott: They're just the same as every other humans power.

556
00:38:04,986 --> 00:38:06,130
Rym: We have podcasting power.

557
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:11,166
Rym: I think we're only gonna count a power if it is beyond what a normal human can have.

558
00:38:11,186 --> 00:38:15,408
Rym: like D&D stats I think a 17 or higher counts as a power.

559
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:22,351
Scott: Yeah Now here's the other thing which Rym brought up is that you know in comic books and things we have the superheroes and the supervillains Right.

560
00:38:22,853 --> 00:38:25,504
Scott: It's generally sort of like well-defined like.

561
00:38:25,544 --> 00:38:26,207
Scott: he's the good guy.

562
00:38:26,247 --> 00:38:27,070
Scott: He's the bad guy.

563
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,699
Rym: That's what always bothers me like how come in.

564
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:32,730
Rym: a lot of this is like the especially DC Comics.

565
00:38:32,871 --> 00:38:34,684
Rym: I guess though Marvel is not.

566
00:38:34,704 --> 00:38:35,490
Rym: it's not like they've ever done.

567
00:38:35,691 --> 00:38:38,422
Scott: They're both the same in this regard, but I feel like all right.

568
00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:40,150
Rym: the superheroes they're good.

569
00:38:40,391 --> 00:38:40,813
Rym: What do they do?

570
00:38:40,853 --> 00:38:42,901
Rym: they fight supervillains supervillains?

571
00:38:43,102 --> 00:38:43,584
Rym: They're bad.

572
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:44,387
Rym: What do they do?

573
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:49,125
Rym: and Usually it's just fucking be evil for no good goddamn reason.

574
00:38:49,165 --> 00:38:57,729
Rym: just complete assholes Almost bad anime where it's like the bad guys are an evil corporation and they murder their employees and they pollute and they kill.

575
00:38:57,789 --> 00:38:59,195
Rym: and why Fucking huh?

576
00:38:59,356 --> 00:39:02,332
Scott: I mean you'll always get those stories, you know You always get.

577
00:39:02,412 --> 00:39:04,821
Scott: some of the supervillains have a reason for what they do.

578
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:13,570
Scott: They're well-written almost like magneto You know, sometimes you'll get the story where the good the superhero goes bad or the supervillain goes good.

579
00:39:13,911 --> 00:39:18,470
Scott: But it's a story where supervillain goes good or super hero goes bad.

580
00:39:19,072 --> 00:39:27,881
Scott: It's like the person maintains their superhero or supervillain label and they just switch sides Temporarily or sometimes for an extended period of time.

581
00:39:27,901 --> 00:39:30,390
Scott: I contend they don't lose the label.

582
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:35,510
Scott: It's like there's something about it like but in the real world that the label wouldn't exist.

583
00:39:35,651 --> 00:39:36,456
Rym: That's what I was about to say.

584
00:39:36,576 --> 00:39:45,122
Rym: I contend that there are no supervillains because No one who is a super blank Thinks that they're a super person.

585
00:39:45,504 --> 00:39:48,765
Rym: Yes, I mean Try to think dr.

586
00:39:48,805 --> 00:39:54,765
Rym: Doom Should whatever he's after he's after it because that's what the world needs.

587
00:39:55,005 --> 00:40:05,201
Rym: He's the good guy in his book Yep, but well, I guess except in crappy books where someone's just a bad guy, but or where they're just crazy There's a lot of that mad scientist kind of stuff.

588
00:40:05,221 --> 00:40:06,044
Rym: Yeah, that's the other thing.

589
00:40:06,506 --> 00:40:16,382
Rym: I'm sick of supervillains whose plot is Complicated blah, but in the end it's just I'm depressed I want to destroy the world because fuck all of you.

590
00:40:16,402 --> 00:40:28,950
Scott: It's just so overdone and lame Yep, so but I mean if I had a superpower of some sort, you know And I was and I'm gonna basically take the villain.

591
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:32,590
Scott: I'm going to interpret that as Scott's moral code goes out the window.

592
00:40:32,672 --> 00:40:33,269
Scott: That's all right.

593
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:40,350
Rym: Because the other way because there's two ways to look at it Because a lot of the things we want that would probably be good would make us villains in most people's eyes.

594
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,517
Rym: That's true also, but I can't let's do.

595
00:40:42,597 --> 00:40:44,785
Rym: we can start with no moral code right?

596
00:40:45,126 --> 00:40:48,356
Scott: No moral code, you know Superpowers and whatever I want.

597
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:50,161
Rym: I hate to say it if we had no moral code.

598
00:40:50,602 --> 00:40:53,470
Rym: We wouldn't even we we already have superpowers.

599
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,920
Rym: We'd sell a Randy things and make a pile of money.

600
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,530
Rym: I know the cult is so easy.

601
00:40:59,152 --> 00:41:00,517
Rym: I know it'd be trivial.

602
00:41:00,537 --> 00:41:04,310
Scott: I know like now a lot of it depends on what power I have, right?

603
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:09,990
Scott: So I'm basically I'm gonna consider like, you know, like two different levels of power here, right?

604
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,939
Scott: One level of power is like crazy super.

605
00:41:12,979 --> 00:41:13,862
Scott: I can do whatever I want.

606
00:41:13,882 --> 00:41:26,467
Scott: in which case I would probably like, you know Like turn the earth into a utopia for me And then I would maybe fly out into space make another utopia for me and fly around space.

607
00:41:26,487 --> 00:41:28,613
Rym: I Think that's not.

608
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:29,939
Rym: even we should go a little bit lower.

609
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,763
Scott: We all have it lower.

610
00:41:30,823 --> 00:41:34,137
Scott: Okay, so of course then again Maybe there's the altruistic.

611
00:41:34,378 --> 00:41:37,510
Rym: you're a super villain, but that's just because you fuck everything up.

612
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,116
Rym: You know, you have all this power.

613
00:41:39,136 --> 00:41:48,050
Rym: you're a demigod of some kind and you decide all right I'm going to make the world utopia and as we know from all literature it becomes a dystopia.

614
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,447
Rym: Yes, all utopia becomes dystopia.

615
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:55,765
Scott: Yep Okay, let's take a level of power where I'm not really flying around space.

616
00:41:55,906 --> 00:41:57,330
Scott: evil super crazy.

617
00:41:57,691 --> 00:42:07,318
Scott: But basically I can kill anyone and beat anyone up and but no one can touch me because I'm such a badass Death note basically Kara death note.

618
00:42:07,338 --> 00:42:07,659
Scott: He's not.

619
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:09,062
Scott: I'm talking like invincible.

620
00:42:09,082 --> 00:42:13,696
Scott: Like I'm Superman, but I mean, I Don't know how interesting that is.

621
00:42:13,716 --> 00:42:14,198
Rym: What do you do?

622
00:42:14,479 --> 00:42:17,230
Rym: What would I do if I didn't have a moral code either?

623
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:20,510
Rym: Well, I would probably just live a life of decadent luxury.

624
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:22,439
Scott: No, pretty much anyone who pissed me off.

625
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:23,845
Scott: I'd beat the shit out of them.

626
00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:25,533
Rym: That's not that interest I know.

627
00:42:25,633 --> 00:42:29,007
Scott: and then you know, basically the world would end up being.

628
00:42:29,027 --> 00:42:30,997
Scott: you know The way I thought it would be.

629
00:42:31,621 --> 00:42:35,558
Rym: I think a better way to go about this is Forget, you know toss away the moral code.

630
00:42:35,578 --> 00:42:40,154
Rym: What about twisted moral code or a Moral in terms of?

631
00:42:40,215 --> 00:42:44,110
Rym: you know and justifies the needs that the means supervillain we have?

632
00:42:44,872 --> 00:42:52,050
Rym: So let's take goals that we might have but remove all moralistic obstacles and then give ourselves varying levels of superpower.

633
00:42:52,211 --> 00:42:55,790
Scott: Okay, so one goal would be to get rid of like religion.

634
00:42:56,111 --> 00:43:01,026
Scott: So I would go and I would just smash all the churches if you were Superman.

635
00:43:01,488 --> 00:43:02,150
Rym: that doesn't work.

636
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,509
Rym: That'll just make people believe more.

637
00:43:04,471 --> 00:43:06,140
Scott: Okay, then I would kill all the priests.

638
00:43:06,843 --> 00:43:08,029
Rym: that probably wouldn't work.

639
00:43:09,471 --> 00:43:10,054
Rym: You got to be more.

640
00:43:10,194 --> 00:43:13,388
Scott: I would use my superpowers to convince them that I had killed God.

641
00:43:13,408 --> 00:43:15,339
Rym: God You're like the worst supervillain.

642
00:43:15,419 --> 00:43:17,050
Rym: All right, so I'm a supervillain.

643
00:43:18,051 --> 00:43:22,102
Rym: Well, I'll be real generic about my powers and I want to destroy religion.

644
00:43:22,442 --> 00:43:27,822
Rym: All right, what I would do is orchestrate all Ozymandias style some sort of like.

645
00:43:28,164 --> 00:43:30,472
Rym: because look he runs the giant Boy.

646
00:43:30,493 --> 00:43:31,916
Rym: he can do whatever he wants to do.

647
00:43:32,157 --> 00:43:35,947
Rym: He's a superhero who has like every he has all the power.

648
00:43:35,967 --> 00:43:38,411
Rym: He's like Batman times 10.

649
00:43:38,411 --> 00:43:39,295
Rym: He's like open Batman.

650
00:43:39,315 --> 00:43:43,330
Rym: It's like if Batman Bruce Wayne now, there's a spoiler turns out Batman.

651
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:53,160
Rym: But Instead of being Batman Bruce Wayne was just like, you know what?

652
00:43:53,883 --> 00:43:54,926
Rym: I'm fucking Bruce Wayne.

653
00:43:54,947 --> 00:43:55,830
Rym: I'll do whatever I want.

654
00:43:56,432 --> 00:43:57,656
Rym: I'm Batman, but it doesn't matter.

655
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:59,864
Rym: Yeah, I don't even do Batman things privately.

656
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:00,667
Rym: I'm just Bruce Wayne.

657
00:44:00,927 --> 00:44:01,530
Rym: suck it bitches.

658
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:04,098
Rym: Yeah, so I want to destroy religion, right?

659
00:44:04,118 --> 00:44:12,423
Rym: I use all of my means to trick the world bit by bit into believing that the second coming is happening.

660
00:44:12,443 --> 00:44:36,020
Rym: and either that me or even better if I find someone else Especially if I find a superhero who could emulate the supposed powers of the supposed of Jesus Then I would make the world believe that there's Jesus second coming and then at the moment of truth I'd reveal that it was I I'd set it up to convince everyone that God died and That was it and it was over and there was no more religion.

661
00:44:36,361 --> 00:44:38,169
Scott: The thing is, you know, they did you.

662
00:44:39,538 --> 00:44:43,118
Scott: the thing about Convincing people that God died is sort of like.

663
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:45,345
Scott: well, they're still believing in magical thinking.

664
00:44:45,365 --> 00:44:58,632
Rym: you have to eliminate the magical thinking That in the end all magic is all Religious blah blah has been destroyed and all that's left is logic and this is the last whatever thing and I'm gonna destroy it Right now.

665
00:44:58,672 --> 00:45:03,490
Scott: I see his is another question right if I get some sort of crazy powers, right?

666
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:09,389
Scott: Will I still only have my very human desires or will I gain some sort of?

667
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:13,642
Rym: Transhuman or post human thinking Doc Manhattan style?

668
00:45:13,662 --> 00:45:22,569
Scott: because if I have if I still have my human desires You know, I get mad moneys mad ladies mad, you know, what famous people get, you know all that stuff, right?

669
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:25,889
Scott: Not well, if I'm immune to drugs, maybe I'll do those two, right?

670
00:45:27,211 --> 00:45:34,655
Scott: But if I have some sort of post human desires and you know money and ladies and cars and mansions Well, then you become Hannibal.

671
00:45:34,936 --> 00:45:35,739
Scott: don't do it for me.

672
00:45:35,759 --> 00:45:48,766
Rym: Actually that that I realized something It's a transhuman very very likely becomes automatically in the eyes of Non-transhumans a supervillain quite possibly.

673
00:45:48,786 --> 00:45:52,957
Rym: I mean look at Hannibal The only I mean the fundamental.

674
00:45:52,997 --> 00:45:53,378
Rym: messed up.

675
00:45:53,438 --> 00:45:56,928
Scott: the thing is you can be transhuman without eating people.

676
00:45:57,109 --> 00:45:58,685
Scott: No, no No, you can't.

677
00:45:58,868 --> 00:46:01,581
Rym: yes You can't know but but but it doesn't have to be eating people.

678
00:46:01,621 --> 00:46:05,617
Rym: the idea there if you break it down Is that he is transcended all.

679
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:06,801
Rym: he's not human.

680
00:46:07,122 --> 00:46:09,370
Rym: He's something different not better.

681
00:46:09,451 --> 00:46:09,693
Rym: I'm not.

682
00:46:09,754 --> 00:46:21,730
Rym: I mean not necessarily better or anything But just after after and as a result more powerful and His desires and wants and needs are so utterly alien and so utterly contrary.

683
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:25,030
Scott: Yeah, it's as if he's like was an alien from outer space.

684
00:46:25,301 --> 00:46:25,671
Rym: I mean It's.

685
00:46:26,012 --> 00:46:31,570
Rym: it's almost like if you become powerful in this way that maybe you don't intend to be a supervillain.

686
00:46:31,971 --> 00:46:38,350
Rym: You just the way you perceive the world is such that the things you do are perceived by others as supervillainy.

687
00:46:39,072 --> 00:46:45,087
Scott: Yeah, it's just like because you know you become something that's not human right in a way and you don't.

688
00:46:45,187 --> 00:46:47,837
Scott: you no longer want the Things humans want.

689
00:46:47,877 --> 00:46:50,470
Scott: your you know, the your perfect, you know.

690
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:54,430
Scott: I mean even though every human has a different idea what the perfect world is like.

691
00:46:54,470 --> 00:47:00,514
Scott: There are a lot of you know common themes, but if you become something else other than human You're gonna.

692
00:47:00,534 --> 00:47:03,104
Scott: maybe you won't have any common themes with that humans want.

693
00:47:03,164 --> 00:47:07,459
Scott: I'm sure that like raccoons I mean their perfect world is like a pile of trash.

694
00:47:07,479 --> 00:47:09,948
Scott: They don't have any common themes with what humans want, right?

695
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:13,131
Scott: So maybe you know You're.

696
00:47:13,251 --> 00:47:23,457
Scott: you would just I would try to fight for whatever that was and I'd probably achieve it because I'd have great power but all the humans would be upset because My wants are nothing like their one.

697
00:47:23,478 --> 00:47:25,804
Rym: instead of with great power comes great responsibility.

698
00:47:25,904 --> 00:47:27,890
Rym: It's with great power comes eating people.

699
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:31,523
Scott: Well, no, I hope I wouldn't want to eat people but you might you don't know.

700
00:47:31,543 --> 00:47:39,770
Rym: I might watch you become Transcendent and suddenly like oh hopefully I'm eating people is the way I. how could I not have known this until now?

701
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:41,954
Scott: Here's my hope right?

702
00:47:41,994 --> 00:47:42,174
Scott: is it?

703
00:47:42,215 --> 00:47:47,130
Scott: humans want fast cars mansions members of the opposite sex there or hoping the same sex.

704
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:50,199
Rym: They're hoping that transhuman Scott just wants enlightenment or something.

705
00:47:50,219 --> 00:47:53,870
Scott: No transhuman Scott just wants bigger mansions faster cars.

706
00:47:55,499 --> 00:47:57,650
Rym: See, I think the more because it's hard to get into specifics.

707
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:09,126
Rym: I think one thing that's definitely been illustrated is that the Rym supervillain regardless of his desires Orchestrates the large and complicated subtle plan that culminates in an epic.

708
00:48:09,266 --> 00:48:09,507
Rym: Yes.

709
00:48:09,788 --> 00:48:14,462
Rym: I've done it And your plan is the look at me.

710
00:48:14,482 --> 00:48:15,526
Rym: I'm the supervillain.

711
00:48:15,647 --> 00:48:16,350
Rym: Fuck you all.

712
00:48:17,612 --> 00:48:18,657
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

713
00:48:18,758 --> 00:48:19,160
Scott: I would do.

714
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:25,659
Scott: I would be a lot more like Let's try to think of supervillains that we would be like.

715
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,666
Rym: I'm Batman I'm evil Batman.

716
00:48:27,727 --> 00:48:28,650
Rym: you'd be evil Batman.

717
00:48:29,635 --> 00:48:32,390
Rym: I'd be evil not depressed Batman.

718
00:48:33,063 --> 00:48:33,369
Rym: I don't know.

719
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,584
Rym: I don't know enough superheroes to come up with who that would be.

720
00:48:35,645 --> 00:48:36,349
Scott: see I would be a lot.

721
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:37,955
Scott: I would be a lot more like rezo.

722
00:48:37,975 --> 00:48:39,480
Scott: I'd be like doing the ritual right now.

723
00:48:40,082 --> 00:48:41,265
Rym: Ah rezo my man.

724
00:48:41,346 --> 00:48:44,617
Scott: I'm more like rezo or Perhaps I'm so great.

725
00:48:44,637 --> 00:48:45,684
Rym: He's like, hey, I'm after this.

726
00:48:45,784 --> 00:48:46,589
Rym: Oh, look there it is.

727
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:50,604
Scott: Or perhaps I would be more like, you know magneto with less restraint.

728
00:48:50,664 --> 00:48:52,330
Rym: See I'm more like zellows.

729
00:48:52,612 --> 00:48:53,339
Rym: I'm more of the.

730
00:48:53,703 --> 00:48:56,535
Scott: I've got this plan Of course know what I'm?

731
00:48:56,575 --> 00:49:00,267
Scott: maybe maybe if I was posthuman though, I might be more like Galactus.

732
00:49:00,308 --> 00:49:01,050
Scott: just eat the world.

733
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:02,919
Scott: But it's just a world is just food to me.

734
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:06,815
Rym: It's not a you know, oh, yeah You're but then that's the same as Hannibal.

735
00:49:06,915 --> 00:49:08,721
Scott: I know Galactus is the same as Hannibal.

736
00:49:08,761 --> 00:49:11,008
Scott: So only bigger and dorky looking.

737
00:49:11,329 --> 00:49:12,414
Rym: Wow There we go.

738
00:49:12,736 --> 00:49:14,385
Rym: Yeah, don't call him dark.

739
00:49:14,425 --> 00:49:15,129
Rym: He'll fucking eat you.

740
00:49:16,311 --> 00:49:18,118
Scott: He doesn't even know I'm an ant to him.

741
00:49:18,158 --> 00:49:18,560
Scott: That's like.

742
00:49:18,781 --> 00:49:21,230
Scott: it's like telling an ant don't call the human dorky.

743
00:49:22,312 --> 00:49:22,774
Rym: What if?

744
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:22,995
Rym: what?

745
00:49:23,035 --> 00:49:28,956
Rym: if an ant crawled into your ear and was like hey, I'm an ant It wouldn't be an ant it would.

746
00:49:28,976 --> 00:49:30,382
Scott: it would suddenly be post ant.

747
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:34,440
Rym: it'd be post ant but it still looks like an ant because Hannibal still looks like a human.

748
00:49:34,702 --> 00:49:35,888
Scott: I know that's that's the thing.

749
00:49:35,928 --> 00:49:38,338
Scott: Galactus I guess looks like a human to humans.

750
00:49:38,398 --> 00:49:41,430
Scott: But actually if you're not human Galactus looks different to everybody.

751
00:49:43,591 --> 00:49:52,383
Scott: That says I just I was picturing what he looks like to you But to me he looks like, you know, I guess to humans He looks like the pink blue thing, but to lie.

752
00:49:52,463 --> 00:49:53,990
Rym: Why do you look like a pink thing to humans?

753
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:54,873
Scott: I don't know.

754
00:49:54,894 --> 00:49:55,760
Scott: There's an explanation.

755
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:56,787
Scott: That's probably really dorky.

756
00:49:58,191 --> 00:50:01,122
Rym: Speaking of what's the deal with all these different colored lantern?

757
00:50:01,162 --> 00:50:01,965
Rym: Whatever is now?

758
00:50:01,985 --> 00:50:02,929
Scott: I don't know.

759
00:50:03,913 --> 00:50:07,707
Scott: I read one shitty green lantern that was only green and I'm not gonna read me the other one cuz.

760
00:50:07,787 --> 00:50:10,565
Rym: I can't think of anything Dumber than having a blue find out about that shit.

761
00:50:10,746 --> 00:50:11,189
Rym: I don't know.

762
00:50:12,032 --> 00:50:14,090
Rym: Maybe I made it up, but I thought I heard something somewhere.

763
00:50:14,391 --> 00:50:18,328
Scott: Well, you're right, but all I know about as much as you do great.

764
00:50:18,669 --> 00:50:21,641
Scott: Yeah Do we got anything else to say about that?

765
00:50:21,662 --> 00:50:21,944
Rym: I don't know.

766
00:50:22,004 --> 00:50:22,850
Rym: It's kind of a cop-out.

767
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:32,184
Rym: we explored a lot of ideas and I kind of want to make some potatoes or a sandwich or something and Actually have a big presentation on game theory at work tomorrow for like half my company.

768
00:50:32,224 --> 00:50:33,910
Rym: So I kind of got to prepare that.

769
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:35,071
Scott: Let's see.

770
00:50:35,312 --> 00:50:42,070
Scott: Who is the the coolest super villain in you know in any fictional work Hannibal you think so?

771
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:42,674
Rym: I don't know.

772
00:50:42,694 --> 00:50:43,403
Rym: It's hard to say.

773
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:47,972
Rym: hmm Constantine fictional.

774
00:50:48,656 --> 00:50:49,361
Rym: well, it depends.

775
00:50:49,582 --> 00:50:50,769
Scott: we're talking fiction fiction.

776
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:56,950
Rym: It's hard to say I could name any number of people from the prince of nothing the darkness that comes before.

777
00:50:57,031 --> 00:51:03,628
Scott: I'm a fan of Not Sauron, but you know What came before Sauron?

778
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,518
Scott: Morgoth whatever it was.

779
00:51:06,538 --> 00:51:07,885
Scott: I'm gonna have to can't believe.

780
00:51:07,906 --> 00:51:08,609
Scott: I forget the name.

781
00:51:09,493 --> 00:51:10,095
Rym: It's tricky.

782
00:51:10,436 --> 00:51:11,480
Rym: Maybe Cthulhu.

783
00:51:11,882 --> 00:51:19,967
Scott: Cthulhu is not really a villain He's transhuman he's just an alien sort of transcending.

784
00:51:19,987 --> 00:51:22,234
Rym: hmm See, it's tough.

785
00:51:22,595 --> 00:51:24,463
Rym: It is pretty tough because it's come up recently.

786
00:51:24,483 --> 00:51:25,930
Rym: I might have to go with the no god.

787
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:29,800
Rym: Yeah, hardly just because I don't know what his deal is.

788
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,365
Rym: Yeah, I know his deal like.

789
00:51:31,385 --> 00:51:32,650
Rym: well, then I'll reevaluate.

790
00:51:32,911 --> 00:51:34,840
Scott: Yeah, I don't know the no gods deal, but I did.

791
00:51:35,041 --> 00:51:36,810
Scott: there was that no man in the prologue.

792
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:37,773
Scott: He was pretty cool.

793
00:51:38,014 --> 00:51:39,620
Rym: Ah the non men the non man.

794
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,543
Scott: I like the non man.

795
00:51:40,683 --> 00:51:50,450
Rym: They're kind of Hannibal - they're kind of they were Something but now they're transcendent as a result Crazy appearing to people who aren't at that level, but that level is not necessarily better.

796
00:51:50,912 --> 00:51:53,623
Rym: Yeah, I mean I don't think that guy was having a good time.

797
00:51:53,925 --> 00:51:55,130
Scott: No no not at all.

798
00:51:55,471 --> 00:51:56,775
Rym: You're gonna find out more about them.

799
00:51:57,117 --> 00:51:57,337
Rym: Yep.

800
00:51:57,418 --> 00:52:00,809
Rym: I'll say one thing they have the best reliefs of any reliefs ever.

801
00:52:01,714 --> 00:52:04,090
Rym: You think you think you can imagine an awesome relief?

802
00:52:04,351 --> 00:52:04,832
Rym: It's better.

803
00:52:05,394 --> 00:52:10,010
Scott: you know if I was like a crazy super villain you know what I would do have a building full of reliefs.

804
00:52:10,291 --> 00:52:11,296
Scott: I'd just make reliefs.

805
00:52:11,356 --> 00:52:13,910
Scott: I'd make the craziest most evil reliefs ever.

806
00:52:14,512 --> 00:52:17,301
Rym: Wait till you find out about the reliefs in that book cuz they're crazy.

807
00:52:17,803 --> 00:52:19,067
Rym: They're beyond your edge.

808
00:52:19,108 --> 00:52:19,830
Scott: We should get some reliefs.

809
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:21,475
Rym: What kind of reliefs?

810
00:52:21,556 --> 00:52:21,838
Scott: I don't know.

811
00:52:21,858 --> 00:52:22,703
Scott: I'm gonna go on eBay.

812
00:52:22,945 --> 00:52:23,770
Scott: I'm gonna search for reliefs.

813
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:31,970
Rym: Whoa, here's an idea for all you artists out there in the artist alleys make simple clay relief tablet.

814
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:33,301
Rym: Oh look that are all Cthulhu.

815
00:52:33,321 --> 00:52:36,215
Rym: We and sell them in the art Search release on eBay.

816
00:52:36,255 --> 00:52:37,778
Scott: guess what I found you found Cthulhu.

817
00:52:37,799 --> 00:52:38,340
Rym: We reliefs.

818
00:52:38,701 --> 00:52:40,946
Scott: I found a. not only that I find reliefs.

819
00:52:41,327 --> 00:52:46,018
Scott: I found a rare Ancient Egyptian huge Sun God wall relief.

820
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,202
Rym: how much is it?

821
00:52:47,202 --> 00:52:48,866
Rym: 50 bucks really?

822
00:52:49,107 --> 00:52:50,110
Rym: Yeah, not a replica.

823
00:52:50,617 --> 00:52:51,430
Scott: It might be a replica.

824
00:52:52,611 --> 00:52:53,735
Rym: You see y'all.

825
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,260
Rym: relief says replica.

826
00:52:55,300 --> 00:53:01,270
Rym: It doesn't matter if it's a really well my relief says Kind of think of something funny other than Desert Eagle.

827
00:53:01,631 --> 00:53:11,243
Rym: My relief says Ozymandias look the mighty mine says Cthulhu relay photography, I believe it's Cthulhu photography.

828
00:53:11,323 --> 00:53:14,173
Rym: the other word like whatever It's Lee.

829
00:53:14,434 --> 00:53:17,304
Scott: whether this relief is genuine or not it actually looks pretty cool.

830
00:53:18,047 --> 00:53:18,950
Rym: buy it safety box.

831
00:53:19,572 --> 00:53:19,894
Scott: What do I get?

832
00:53:19,934 --> 00:53:20,215
Scott: deal with it.

833
00:53:20,356 --> 00:53:21,280
Rym: put it in your room?

834
00:53:21,581 --> 00:53:21,822
Scott: No?

835
00:53:21,902 --> 00:53:23,088
Scott: I don't need a relief in my room.

836
00:53:23,168 --> 00:53:26,896
Scott: Thank you That's that's what the supervillain does.

837
00:53:27,077 --> 00:53:30,049
Scott: he slips his evil reliefs into other people's rooms.

838
00:53:31,831 --> 00:53:38,235
Rym: Well if I woke up and there was a large relief just kind of staring me in the face in my bedroom I don't know what I would do.

839
00:53:38,255 --> 00:53:41,609
Rym: I should buy the relief, but I really don't know what I would do.

840
00:53:42,517 --> 00:53:43,528
Rym: I'd be like the monkeys.

841
00:53:43,568 --> 00:53:45,838
Rym: just It's like the monolith.

842
00:53:45,939 --> 00:53:47,570
Scott: I should buy a relief and play room.

843
00:53:47,771 --> 00:53:48,254
Rym: What did you pick?

844
00:53:48,274 --> 00:53:50,810
Rym: the wrong relief and I become transhuman and then I eat you?

845
00:53:51,711 --> 00:53:53,640
Scott: Well, who am I to say you're wrong?

846
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,222
Scott: who am I to?

847
00:53:54,363 --> 00:53:57,885
Scott: that'd be like an ant telling the lack of Judge Hannibal, you know what?

848
00:53:59,651 --> 00:54:00,915
Rym: Yeah, I'd probably lock him up.

849
00:54:01,015 --> 00:54:03,322
Scott: Anyway, I probably would do it's tricky.

850
00:54:03,382 --> 00:54:05,930
Rym: It's like wow, you've transcended humanity.

851
00:54:06,011 --> 00:54:07,387
Rym: That's great back to jail with you.

852
00:54:09,232 --> 00:54:11,709
Scott: Well, you didn't transcend him enough to get the hell away.

853
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:13,076
Rym: Yeah, except he does.

854
00:54:13,096 --> 00:54:17,577
Scott: but he he can get away but he can't get away perfectly Kind of can.

855
00:54:17,617 --> 00:54:19,809
Scott: if he was perfect then they never would have caught him ever.

856
00:54:20,593 --> 00:54:24,189
Rym: Yeah, but what if he got caught on purpose because it was fun or because he had more power that way?

857
00:54:24,651 --> 00:54:26,617
Rym: Well, they can't second-guess someone like that.

858
00:54:26,637 --> 00:54:28,402
Scott: That's the if that's the truth.

859
00:54:28,523 --> 00:54:30,890
Rym: That's the biggest problem with transhuman.

860
00:54:32,431 --> 00:54:33,414
Rym: Every second guess them.

861
00:54:33,514 --> 00:54:38,467
Scott: if that is true, then basically you have no choice in the matter.

862
00:54:38,507 --> 00:54:39,269
Scott: So just let it be.
