00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,409
Rym: It's Thursday June 14.

2
00:00:12,409 --> 00:00:12,951
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,192 --> 00:00:15,660
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:16,742 --> 00:00:19,820
Rym: Tonight we talk a bit about the nimby's and the bananas.

5
00:00:24,371 --> 00:00:25,387
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,606 --> 00:00:31,239
Scott: So Rym how cool is your work?

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,780
Rym: Um I don't want to answer that question really because it makes me kind of sad.

8
00:00:38,002 --> 00:00:39,126
Scott: Cuz your work's not cool.

9
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:39,488
Rym: Well.

10
00:00:39,508 --> 00:00:50,980
Rym: Here's the thing I used to complain a lot about working at IBM But to IVM's credit that was my first Job where I wasn't in college and didn't care and showed up late and left early every day like it was an actual job.

11
00:00:51,705 --> 00:00:53,579
Rym: And I realized now that I didn't really hate IVM.

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:11,523
Rym: I just hated working nine-to-five, and I don't want to say my current job sucks, but I spent four hours today sitting Watching service pack 4 for Windows 2000 install on a computer with 64 megabytes of RAM Awesome.

13
00:01:12,146 --> 00:01:18,572
Rym: so job is not cool, so I think it was when I get to go into the ER Which is not so much cool as frightening.

14
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:23,313
Scott: so a couple days ago My company is run by these four people who are all equal partners.

15
00:01:23,534 --> 00:01:35,195
Scott: right a couple days ago One of the partners rolls into work on literally like Katamari like on some rollerblades into his office And then he just doesn't take him off and every time he leaves his office.

16
00:01:35,235 --> 00:01:36,359
Scott: He goes whoosh whoosh.

17
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:45,458
Scott: ah You realize that when I worked at IBM and the floor in my office is like this flat sort of bare concrete floors He was just whooshing all over the office.

18
00:01:46,402 --> 00:01:48,720
Rym: The the campus where I worked was kind of big.

19
00:01:49,062 --> 00:02:02,529
Rym: I mean if I had to walk to like certain other buildings or within Buildings two other like parts of buildings it could take a half hour or more sometimes just because they were that big Every day for the three years that I worked there.

20
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:09,620
Rym: I thought man if only if only I could wear my rollerblades in here without being fired.

21
00:02:10,282 --> 00:02:12,751
Scott: All right, you want to hear something else that it's even.

22
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:14,296
Scott: that's a little bit better than that.

23
00:02:14,697 --> 00:02:15,279
Rym: I don't hear it.

24
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,368
Scott: So there's some big busy.

25
00:02:17,408 --> 00:02:18,592
Scott: You know my company.

26
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:19,576
Scott: It's like where whatever you want.

27
00:02:19,596 --> 00:02:21,142
Scott: We don't care pajamas He gives you shit.

28
00:02:21,202 --> 00:02:28,987
Scott: right I have to wear but dress shirts, but every day, but They told us there was a big meeting.

29
00:02:29,047 --> 00:02:32,580
Scott: like some people business people are coming right you know we got it.

30
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:40,159
Scott: we got a dress nice today right and Basically what they told us was wear long pants and don't wear flip-flops.

31
00:02:42,142 --> 00:02:46,440
Scott: Some people came in wearing you know nice shirt and shoes and then you know pants and whatever.

32
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,127
Scott: but I wore jeans in this.

33
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,999
Scott: I guess it's a short sleeve shirt with a collar.

34
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:54,359
Scott: and Of course the business people didn't show up.

35
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:02,840
Scott: They'll probably show up on Monday, but yeah the the point is is that they say dress nice Wear long pants and not flip-flops.

36
00:03:05,763 --> 00:03:07,839
Scott: You know my job's not cool.

37
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:09,584
Scott: Jobs not go.

38
00:03:09,604 --> 00:03:10,727
Rym: so I mean the only thing.

39
00:03:10,788 --> 00:03:13,497
Scott: oh, I finished pretty much all of my work today.

40
00:03:13,517 --> 00:03:16,608
Scott: Yeah Yeah, I'm like I'm gonna.

41
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:17,351
Scott: I'm out of work.

42
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:19,860
Scott: Which is awesome because I love it when all the work is done.

43
00:03:20,383 --> 00:03:22,339
Rym: I've taken upon myself a lot of extra work.

44
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,408
Rym: I keep writing these proposals.

45
00:03:24,488 --> 00:03:26,556
Rym: like you know the company will work better.

46
00:03:26,596 --> 00:03:30,679
Rym: if you guys did blah I just keep sending them up the chain and nothing ever comes back down.

47
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:34,532
Scott: Probably just haven't been a pile on in the shredder bin now.

48
00:03:34,552 --> 00:03:36,960
Rym: They're probably like yeah that punks writing this thing again.

49
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,744
Rym: What's it this time?

50
00:03:38,046 --> 00:03:40,599
Rym: He's saying something about having a DNS?

51
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,960
Rym: Something to control printers instead of just doing it randomly like we do now.

52
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:58,370
Rym: Good I think my favorite one is you know guys might be useful to have some sort of documentation server Somewhere to store.

53
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,770
Rym: I don't know Documentation cuz the currently isn't any.

54
00:04:02,373 --> 00:04:03,860
Rym: yeah, there is where?

55
00:04:07,244 --> 00:04:13,606
Rym: And I think the words that my boss's boss gave me in return were Yeah, they've been working on that for a while.

56
00:04:13,646 --> 00:04:14,328
Rym: Don't hold your breath.

57
00:04:14,348 --> 00:04:17,184
Scott: Uh-huh Well my work's cool.

58
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:18,168
Scott: Your work's not cool.

59
00:04:18,188 --> 00:04:19,653
Rym: Does your work need an IT guy?

60
00:04:19,673 --> 00:04:21,680
Rym: I'm a highly trained professional.

61
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,088
Scott: Well, you might need a technical writer soon.

62
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:25,512
Rym: I'm a technical writer.

63
00:04:25,553 --> 00:04:26,616
Rym: I took classes on it.

64
00:04:26,897 --> 00:04:27,780
Rym: That's on my resume.

65
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:30,579
Rym: I would take we have an IT guy.

66
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,880
Scott: the thing is like he's like the admin for everything and he's sort of like a big windows guy and You're probably smarter than he is.

67
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,503
Scott: I don't think they're looking to replace him and I don't think they he needs any help either because he spends most of his day Playing MMOs.

68
00:04:43,864 --> 00:04:46,030
Rym: I will tell you sadly that I I am.

69
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:52,953
Scott: I have more experience still with windows admitting the Linux admitting Yeah, even so, you know, this guy is like a super windows guy like.

70
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:54,739
Scott: he knows stuff that I know you don't know.

71
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:59,999
Scott: Yeah, luckily all that's like if there's an exchange something going on he's like ban there it is.

72
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,795
Rym: That's just not that hard really to be perfectly honest, but he already knows it.

73
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,786
Rym: Whereas you would have to look it up Yeah, but I have to look up everything once.

74
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:08,832
Scott: Yeah, this guy's already looked it up.

75
00:05:09,555 --> 00:05:11,160
Rym: Oh, well, I could be a tech writer.

76
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,388
Rym: I'd take a pay cut just to be able to wear rollerblades.

77
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,071
Scott: Yeah.

78
00:05:14,091 --> 00:05:15,195
Scott: Well, we'll see what happens.

79
00:05:15,255 --> 00:05:18,919
Rym: I Mean I wrote that article for imagine FX.

80
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:26,000
Scott: The thing is if they do get a tech writer will probably be like, you know We'll keep you until you write all the documentation we need and then we don't need you anymore.

81
00:05:26,444 --> 00:05:29,756
Rym: God, I could do something like that on the side maybe.

82
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:36,335
Rym: Anyway, so it's Thursday, which means we really we're tired from doing shows all week.

83
00:05:36,676 --> 00:05:38,180
Rym: We don't really have anything to talk about.

84
00:05:38,461 --> 00:05:39,264
Rym: There's no direction.

85
00:05:39,304 --> 00:05:41,652
Rym: we can pick anything in the world and it's funny out.

86
00:05:42,014 --> 00:05:50,404
Rym: when I have to pick a tech news or something About I don't know anime it always is easier because while there's fewer news I just have some direction.

87
00:05:50,424 --> 00:05:55,865
Rym: but now I could pick any of the thousand stories on FARC and I have something funny to say About all of them.

88
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:56,792
Scott: All right.

89
00:05:56,832 --> 00:05:57,900
Scott: Well, which one did you pick?

90
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:04,729
Rym: Well, the one I picked is one that's very near and dear to me for apparently Somewhere in this country in a Waterbury Connecticut.

91
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:07,197
Rym: In fact Waterbury Waterbury.

92
00:06:07,217 --> 00:06:09,265
Rym: It's Waterbury I know it's.

93
00:06:09,305 --> 00:06:11,215
Scott: we drove through there on the way to Connecticut.

94
00:06:11,255 --> 00:06:12,160
Scott: It's sort of half city.

95
00:06:12,722 --> 00:06:14,490
Scott: It's you know, you drive through it on the highway.

96
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,760
Scott: It looks like a city, but it's not quite a city.

97
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,500
Scott: It's like a. it's like a busy town with actual tall buildings in it.

98
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:28,000
Rym: I'll be honest Connecticut is a blur to me and other than your parents house and Danbury I really have no concept of where anything is in Connecticut at all.

99
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,423
Scott: I know where things are in Connecticut.

100
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:44,644
Rym: But anyway, so at this school, they've decided to get tough on absenteeism, you know people skipping truancy and it looks like about 2,000 students who otherwise I get from what I can assume the article is not as Descriptive as I would like it to be.

101
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:53,636
Rym: who otherwise would have passed will now fail after repeat a grade solely because they missed 19 or more days of school without valid excuses.

102
00:06:54,279 --> 00:07:12,769
Rym: now I have mixed feelings about this because on the one hand Attending school in a perfect world is important because you learn things at school Yeah but at the same time I went to public school and I know well exactly why those students were skipping and I Probably applaud them and would have been skipping with them.

103
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:23,137
Rym: Yep - At least in high school I'm definitely of the mind that if you can pass all the tests and do all the projects and get good grades.

104
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,069
Rym: Attendance shouldn't matter at all.

105
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:31,677
Rym: And I say that mostly because I was fairly notorious in high school for skipping all the goddamn time.

106
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,065
Rym: I'd show up like two hours late.

107
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:35,871
Rym: I just leave for an hour lunch.

108
00:07:36,112 --> 00:07:38,320
Rym: We'd go to Cedar Point instead of going to school.

109
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,709
Rym: I never told my parents ever told anyone.

110
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:45,787
Rym: I just sometimes I'd get up like I was gonna go to school and I get up On time and I just wouldn't go to school.

111
00:07:45,808 --> 00:07:48,537
Scott: Yeah, where'd you go anywhere?

112
00:07:48,557 --> 00:07:49,360
Rym: We go to the park?

113
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,606
Rym: I'd grab some people and hang out.

114
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,619
Rym: we'd go to first period so they wouldn't be wise to us and then we'd leave.

115
00:07:54,701 --> 00:08:07,073
Rym: The best thing was now here's the thing technically if you had three or more unexcused absences in my school you failed the class automatically and There was one interesting moment near the end of the year.

116
00:08:07,093 --> 00:08:08,540
Rym: we're a good friend of mine trumpet player.

117
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,257
Rym: I won't say his name because I haven't seen him in a while and I don't know where he is right now.

118
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:16,580
Rym: And Anyway, we both pretty much skipped the same amount of class.

119
00:08:16,721 --> 00:08:18,091
Rym: We both tended to skip together.

120
00:08:18,192 --> 00:08:19,300
Rym: even if we didn't do things together.

121
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:26,911
Rym: We both used each other as excuses like I'd go up in the middle of I don't know third period and say hey Blah blah blah blah.

122
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:38,698
Rym: There's a band thing I gotta go work on to make something up in the band room for the musical next week, blah blah, okay Sure, whatever and I'd leave and then he'd use that later like oh crap I gotta help with that too and you know that sort of thing.

123
00:08:39,322 --> 00:08:43,554
Rym: So we were near the assistant principal's office and he calls us both in.

124
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,560
Rym: I'm there for unrelated business and he's there.

125
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:59,140
Rym: He's not sure what he's for and they call me in and they say something like alright Brandon we have on record that you have one unexcused absence from English class and we would like to know what was going on.

126
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,744
Rym: And I said, oh Doctor's appointment.

127
00:09:02,327 --> 00:09:04,839
Rym: now note that I didn't even know what day they were referring to.

128
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:07,209
Rym: They didn't say what day or anything.

129
00:09:07,751 --> 00:09:11,037
Rym: and the assistant principal says, oh, okay I assumed it was something like that.

130
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:19,819
Rym: You can leave and as I'm walking out turns to Brian who skipped the same number of classes to me and they say Brian You're going to fail most of your classes.

131
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:23,211
Rym: You've been missing class without any sort of excuse.

132
00:09:24,034 --> 00:09:26,979
Rym: and he turns and looks at me as I'm walking out the door Like what the fuck Rym?

133
00:09:27,906 --> 00:09:32,540
Rym: What the fuck That's all there was to that anecdote.

134
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:42,170
Rym: but it seems like in most schools the teachers tend to at least go to schools cover for the kids who are smart and just let him skip when they want to or when they need to And no harm comes of it.

135
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:42,775
Rym: I did.

136
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:56,334
Scott: Okay, I Think just what it comes down to is the current school system, of course sucks And but if you're going to have it and you're going to you know Take all the go with all the assumptions that it makes that you know.

137
00:09:56,374 --> 00:09:58,120
Scott: better grades equals smarter person.

138
00:09:58,642 --> 00:10:03,139
Scott: You know A's are better than B's, you know, if you get all C's you pass etc.

139
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:14,280
Scott: etc, if you're gonna go with all those assumptions and you're going to take them as true then you can't really Also say that attendance matters if someone gets good grades.

140
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:26,587
Scott: I mean if the test matters because if someone doesn't do attend doesn't come and get straight A's Not likely, you know, you know very rare, but if it happens then you can't have both those rules.

141
00:10:26,628 --> 00:10:27,510
Scott: It makes no sense.

142
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:27,892
Scott: Yeah,

143
00:10:27,932 --> 00:10:42,684
Rym: because if you're saying that someone can fail by something arbitrary like that in high school Then what you're basically saying is yeah the tests don't matter just show up which is kind of true because in all through high school in most high schools in the US if you just show up even if you put forth pretty much zero effort,

144
00:10:42,865 --> 00:10:43,407
Scott: that's what I did.

145
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:44,310
Rym: You're gonna pass.

146
00:10:44,571 --> 00:10:46,758
Rym: Yep, it's so hard to fail high school.

147
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:51,465
Rym: Like it's it's really hard to actually fail Out of high school in the US.

148
00:10:51,586 --> 00:10:56,530
Scott: I never I never studied in all my years of school high school in college.

149
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:00,244
Scott: I have a Bachelor of Science in computer science from RIT, which is not easy.

150
00:11:00,866 --> 00:11:04,461
Scott: I never once Quote studied for a test.

151
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:08,370
Scott: when people said I have to study for a test I didn't know how to do that.

152
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,526
Rym: We made fun of Pete pretty badly because Pete would always thought this is the worst thing.

153
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,450
Rym: He'd always come back.

154
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:14,735
Scott: What is studying mean?

155
00:11:14,996 --> 00:11:18,290
Scott: Do you just like read the textbook again or something?

156
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:27,819
Rym: Pete taught us exactly what studying means cuz it'd be about 11 o'clock on Sunday night and we'd be playing games and Pete would say Alright guys, I gotta go home.

157
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,842
Rym: I got an 8 a.m.

158
00:11:28,863 --> 00:11:36,690
Rym: Class and I got a study for something and He'd leave and then the next day he would tell us that yeah, I woke up around noon.

159
00:11:36,891 --> 00:11:39,223
Rym: I missed both those classes and I didn't study.

160
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:40,509
Rym: so I think that's what studying is.

161
00:11:41,173 --> 00:11:42,761
Rym: I think studying is an excuse to go somewhere.

162
00:11:42,781 --> 00:11:44,610
Scott: What were all those people doing in the library?

163
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:46,319
Rym: See that was the scary thing.

164
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:56,670
Rym: cuz I saw a lot of people at RIT especially like in the first week of classes when nothing happens and They'd already like they'd have this pile of books and they just be in the library for hours and hours.

165
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:01,040
Scott: Like maybe they were trying to learn more than you know, just on their own.

166
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,146
Rym: what learning at a Institute of higher learning.

167
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,335
Scott: I Can't imagine what else they were doing.

168
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,122
Scott: But yeah, I never studied.

169
00:12:09,643 --> 00:12:11,430
Scott: I never took notes in a class.

170
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:13,417
Scott: All I did was go to class.

171
00:12:13,878 --> 00:12:25,357
Rym: I took the test but but the notes I took were very specifically I'd sit there after sleep and I'd listen and every now and then pretty much most of my class experience were Womp womp womp, you know the Charlie Brown voices.

172
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,842
Rym: Yeah, womp womp womp womp.

173
00:12:26,882 --> 00:12:28,387
Rym: The exam is on Tuesday.

174
00:12:28,407 --> 00:12:29,189
Rym: Womp womp womp.

175
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,695
Scott: Yeah, that's exactly.

176
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:33,004
Rym: it will cover chapters one through nine.

177
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:34,309
Rym: Womp womp womp womp.

178
00:12:36,111 --> 00:12:40,104
Scott: Yeah, I did all the assignments that were graded.

179
00:12:40,205 --> 00:12:45,458
Scott: if it was a non graded assignment I usually didn't do it usually every now and then I do something if I really like.

180
00:12:45,538 --> 00:12:47,305
Rym: there was an Active Directory optional lab.

181
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:56,090
Rym: once that I did because I Wanted to learn about Active Directory and by the end of it I didn't want to learn about Active Directory I would never do an assignment if it couldn't affect my grade in any way.

182
00:12:57,074 --> 00:13:05,229
Scott: And I went to class pretty often actually especially in college, you know I guess there's one class that I sort of skipped almost every single class of it.

183
00:13:05,913 --> 00:13:06,737
Rym: well, what's the record?

184
00:13:06,777 --> 00:13:19,704
Scott: because the record for me this I think for Let's see first software engineering lecture of which I think you only get like seven of them I went to like three and the third one was the exam.

185
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:30,203
Rym: All right, I win that one Visual basic for programmers like the set like the advanced one like the end run a visual basic for IT majors Back before they switched over to Java.

186
00:13:30,223 --> 00:13:37,610
Rym: I Showed up on the first day and I accidentally showed up on the second to last day because I forgot what day it was.

187
00:13:38,415 --> 00:13:50,509
Rym: I was gonna show up on the last day to take the exam but I accidentally showed up on the second to last day and it just so happened that the exam was a two-part exam that took both days and There were only nine other people there with me.

188
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,427
Scott: Yeah, taking that part of the exam how many people showed up for the second half?

189
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:56,191
Rym: 60.

190
00:13:56,191 --> 00:14:03,150
Rym: And and I remember sitting there thinking and the shit but for the grace of God go away.

191
00:14:05,132 --> 00:14:11,299
Rym: And I just remember he passed out the exam and I that I think he did this on purpose because he realized that no one Came to a stupid class.

192
00:14:11,824 --> 00:14:13,819
Rym: and it wasn't his fault It was just the class was stupid.

193
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:21,510
Rym: and unless you were an idiot The class was like the most basic dumb programming after a much more rigorous programming class.

194
00:14:21,591 --> 00:14:22,690
Rym: Like they should have reversed the order.

195
00:14:23,052 --> 00:14:37,010
Rym: I don't get it, but it said very specifically Final exam part two and it started with question 51 And the whole like the first ten minutes were people like muttering yourselves like what's going on.

196
00:14:37,891 --> 00:14:39,496
Rym: But I don't get it.

197
00:14:39,897 --> 00:14:43,810
Rym: and then he very calmly just says I see a lot of faces that I really don't recognize.

198
00:14:43,971 --> 00:14:51,732
Rym: good luck on the exam by the way, you got to get at least 60 right to pass and And Yeah Awesome.

199
00:14:52,233 --> 00:15:01,652
Scott: Yeah, that's why I went to class and I did graded assignments or assignments that could affect my grade and that was all I ever did and I Graduated.

200
00:15:01,672 --> 00:15:07,690
Scott: I have all the pieces of paper that I paid for and it didn't take many longer than anyone else.

201
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,177
Scott: It took me exactly as long as it was supposed to.

202
00:15:10,438 --> 00:15:14,230
Rym: my grade suffered in my senior year not from my grade suffered.

203
00:15:14,592 --> 00:15:15,536
Scott: I didn't get A's.

204
00:15:15,837 --> 00:15:17,224
Scott: I didn't get all B's and A's.

205
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:21,976
Scott: my GPA was like under three in college But I got the piece of paper.

206
00:15:21,996 --> 00:15:32,149
Scott: a different piece of paper with extra Latin words on it would make would have made no difference in my current life other than Depriving me of pleasures in college.

207
00:15:32,592 --> 00:15:34,200
Scott: I think I won for me.

208
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,277
Rym: it would have because if I hadn't graduated with honors IBM wouldn't hired me in the first place.

209
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:39,482
Rym: They have GPA requirements.

210
00:15:39,502 --> 00:15:45,490
Scott: Yeah, I would have gotten the job I have now and the job I quit before With or without Latin words.

211
00:15:45,575 --> 00:15:51,210
Rym: Yeah Though my I was funny cuz I pretty much had a 4.0 and then middle way and I'm not more here.

212
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,930
Rym: Yeah, you do now, but I made more money than you for a while.

213
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,016
Rym: I think I've made more time.

214
00:15:55,096 --> 00:15:57,650
Scott: I made a very small amount more than I did now.

215
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,970
Scott: I make much more than you do, but I also made without Latin words.

216
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,909
Rym: I made much more than you do when you worked at that other company before you got a real job.

217
00:16:05,793 --> 00:16:07,520
Rym: Cuz I was working at IBM even back then.

218
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:08,644
Scott: Oh, I want to work with.

219
00:16:08,685 --> 00:16:10,733
Scott: that was a co-op though That wasn't a job.

220
00:16:10,854 --> 00:16:14,330
Rym: IBM was a co-op at first and even the co-op paid 50 grand.

221
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:21,346
Scott: Yeah, my co-op paid like, you know, it was actually pretty sadly But I had such low cost of living.

222
00:16:21,386 --> 00:16:21,850
Scott: it paid well.

223
00:16:22,011 --> 00:16:24,985
Rym: Oh god, when I had that like $8 an hour tech job at RIT.

224
00:16:25,045 --> 00:16:25,990
Rym: I was rolling in dough.

225
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,283
Scott: Yeah, I wasn't with my $7 an hour office job.

226
00:16:29,403 --> 00:16:37,957
Rym: Oh because I had the think about it I got paid like a dollar more than you and my job was like being Worked a lot more hours than I did.

227
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,685
Scott: I worked like 10 hours a week at that.

228
00:16:39,805 --> 00:16:40,850
Rym: Oh, that's cuz I had no money.

229
00:16:40,991 --> 00:16:42,358
Rym: I was out of money by then.

230
00:16:42,378 --> 00:16:44,610
Rym: Yeah, cuz I had squandered all the money I made at IBM.

231
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:47,970
Rym: I remember that I came back to school and it was like I have all this money.

232
00:16:48,331 --> 00:16:49,434
Rym: This is gonna be great.

233
00:16:49,735 --> 00:16:50,698
Rym: and four months later.

234
00:16:50,758 --> 00:16:52,584
Rym: I realized where did it all go?

235
00:16:52,604 --> 00:16:53,386
Scott: All right.

236
00:16:53,406 --> 00:16:54,490
Scott: All right, that's enough of this.

237
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:56,476
Rym: Yeah, it's nice to say.

238
00:16:56,496 --> 00:17:00,850
Rym: I just want to point out that while I might have had a little bit of outrage about.

239
00:17:01,712 --> 00:17:02,881
Rym: You shouldn't make these kids fail.

240
00:17:02,902 --> 00:17:10,527
Rym: I Want to point out that Here's the question that channel 3 eyewitness news reporter Leon Collins asked.

241
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:24,434
Rym: one of the students Who was caught in all this who was making the ruckus for the media now quote you were out 70 days this year 70.

242
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:31,450
Rym: I Have a feeling that Many of the students who were affected by this weren't doing so well in school anywhere and probably should have been going to school.

243
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,910
Scott: Yeah, of course, that's obvious.

244
00:17:33,151 --> 00:17:51,270
Scott: But in principle if someone gets all good grades and you are going to go with a school system that you know Puts this, you know emphasis on grades and actually things grades are real and matter and such Then it's kind of hypocritical to fail someone who gets good grades just because they don't show up.

245
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:55,930
Rym: What it really says is if you can get good grades without showing up then they're not teaching you anything.

246
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,916
Rym: So the school is broken.

247
00:17:57,157 --> 00:17:57,841
Scott: That's also true.

248
00:17:57,962 --> 00:17:58,304
Scott: All right.

249
00:17:58,364 --> 00:17:59,250
Rym: Anyway, that's enough of that.

250
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:06,210
Scott: So there's another Fantastic Four movie coming out and the first one sucked according to everyone.

251
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:10,290
Scott: I never saw it what the one from the 70s know the one that was recent.

252
00:18:10,491 --> 00:18:11,558
Rym: So the second one sucked.

253
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,270
Rym: the first one just sucked more and was well.

254
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,739
Scott: There was actually three of them.

255
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:15,745
Scott: if you there's one from the 70s.

256
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,009
Scott: There was one for the 90s that was never released, but you can watch it all the Internet's.

257
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:24,649
Scott: they just made it to like hold on to some copyrights or something even though it was some terrible movie.

258
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:31,613
Scott: and Then there's the newest the new one that was actually in theaters a year a few years ago or so I'm not sure.

259
00:18:32,094 --> 00:18:36,049
Scott: and then there's the sequel to the new one that is going to be in theaters very soon.

260
00:18:36,069 --> 00:18:55,850
Scott: and some Projectionist, you know a guy who runs projectors at a movie theater for seven dollars an hour Saw the movie early as someone who with that kind of job Occasionally gets to do for whatever reason and Because whatever reason for whatever reason he's running the projector.

261
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,642
Scott: No, I think there was actually like, you know something happening like.

262
00:18:58,662 --> 00:19:00,590
Scott: he wasn't running the projector like he got to see.

263
00:19:02,086 --> 00:19:15,070
Scott: but Basically, he's a cool guy who happens to be a projectionist and he wrote a review of the movie for ain't it cool news calm All right soon after he was fired from his job.

264
00:19:15,351 --> 00:19:20,351
Scott: Well, I guess mostly cuz he made a negative review of the movie Uh-huh.

265
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:23,141
Rym: So you're saying that if the review had been positive they might have overlooked it.

266
00:19:23,522 --> 00:19:30,150
Scott: No, basically, there's all this sort of Is a basically a lack of verifiable information.

267
00:19:30,812 --> 00:19:46,970
Scott: But basically we do know I'm pretty sure that 20th Century Fox called the movie theater You know corporate and said you are someone is unauthorized, you know reviews of Movies at your company somewhere and that's all you know.

268
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:54,615
Scott: I know they said at least that much and we know the guy was fired most likely because of his too early Review of this movie.

269
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:57,444
Rym: Well, here's the really important question one.

270
00:19:57,845 --> 00:19:59,150
Rym: Did he sign an NDA?

271
00:19:59,692 --> 00:20:02,830
Scott: No - he said he would have if they gave him one, but they didn't All right.

272
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:20,050
Rym: So if he didn't sign an NDA and there's no policy in whatever contract or whatever thing allows him to be employed Saying that this sort of thing is grounds for firing and He didn't really violate any laws It really depends on what state it was in and whether or not it's a right-to-work state and all that business.

273
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:25,009
Rym: But he might have some sort of claim that I was fired unjustly.

274
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:30,730
Scott: He might have punitively very may well have some sort of legal claim that he was fired unjustly.

275
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:37,459
Scott: However, I want to say just regardless of the law right forget the law for a minute pretend It's just about right and wrong here.

276
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:38,907
Scott: What Scott thinks is right and wrong.

277
00:20:39,088 --> 00:20:45,070
Scott: All right First of all, I think you should be able to fire anyone for any reason at any time.

278
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:45,732
Rym: Oh, I agree.

279
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,161
Rym: So luckily we live in New York where that's the case.

280
00:20:48,302 --> 00:20:51,834
Rym: Yes, so except for the protected things You know age raised for live.

281
00:20:51,975 --> 00:20:52,416
Scott: Oh, yes.

282
00:20:52,476 --> 00:20:52,697
Scott: Yes.

283
00:20:52,757 --> 00:20:55,246
Scott: Yes, obviously, you know, yeah, you're black you're fired.

284
00:20:55,366 --> 00:20:57,774
Rym: Yeah cool that now That's that that's different.

285
00:20:57,834 --> 00:21:00,443
Rym: Yes, secondly, but you're ugly you're fired.

286
00:21:00,503 --> 00:21:01,366
Rym: It's perfectly fine.

287
00:21:01,486 --> 00:21:06,301
Scott: Yes, but secondly The job was $7 an hour.

288
00:21:06,603 --> 00:21:10,800
Scott: you can go to make any McDonald's and get paid that much and get that job in like a minute.

289
00:21:11,342 --> 00:21:14,393
Scott: who gives a shit if you're fired from your $7 an Hour job.

290
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:15,819
Scott: Yeah, you're making chump change.

291
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:18,070
Scott: I could go out and get three of those jobs in ten minutes.

292
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,841
Scott: Well, what the fuck you so upset about?

293
00:21:19,921 --> 00:21:21,229
Rym: Oh, here's why he's so upset.

294
00:21:21,511 --> 00:21:26,890
Rym: He's either an idiot or brilliant because he would have toiled in obscurity in that job.

295
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,225
Rym: But now he is going to be internet famous.

296
00:21:29,486 --> 00:21:36,250
Rym: the more ruckus He makes the more people will know who he is And as long as he keeps the momentum going he can have a moderately successful blog somewhere.

297
00:21:36,591 --> 00:21:40,565
Scott: Yeah, I think he said he plans on becoming a movie reviewer of some.

298
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:40,886
Scott: Yeah.

299
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:42,150
Rym: Well, you know what he's all set.

300
00:21:42,271 --> 00:21:43,970
Rym: So I think he's pretty canny about all this.

301
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:44,272
Scott: I don't.

302
00:21:44,493 --> 00:21:49,460
Scott: I don't think he did it on purpose though like he did, you know It's like now that he he doesn't have a job.

303
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:51,289
Scott: He's like well now I'm gonna go for my dream.

304
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:52,194
Scott: now They don't have a job.

305
00:21:52,255 --> 00:21:54,608
Scott: It's not like he planned it out like ha ha ha.

306
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:58,443
Scott: I will review this movie early and do it on the internet.

307
00:21:58,725 --> 00:22:00,050
Scott: fire me and I'll make a ruckus.

308
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:05,146
Rym: What I'm saying is it's after the fact now and he has to take advantage of this good turn.

309
00:22:05,326 --> 00:22:07,835
Scott: Yes, of course, but Why would it?

310
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:11,086
Scott: people all it's not just him being upset about losing his $7 job, right?

311
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:16,129
Scott: It's people on the internet are outraged that a guy lost his own.

312
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:24,108
Rym: People on the internet are outraged about something but how could you be outraged about someone losing a $7 job?

313
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:31,301
Rym: I think it's the principle of the thing that the guy worked for a company and he did this thing and he didn't sign any NDA and no one told him he couldn't do this.

314
00:22:31,341 --> 00:22:34,035
Rym: There was no law saying he couldn't do it No contract saying he couldn't do it.

315
00:22:34,537 --> 00:22:42,850
Scott: So he did it on his own time, but that means that these people Don't agree that you should be able to fire anyone for almost any reason at any time.

316
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:43,933
Rym: Oh, no I think what that.

317
00:22:43,993 --> 00:22:51,197
Rym: what I would say is that I agree that legally they should have the right to fire him and There's really shouldn't be any problem with that.

318
00:22:51,479 --> 00:22:53,810
Rym: However, I think that they're all asshats.

319
00:22:54,031 --> 00:22:55,458
Scott: Oh, yeah, I didn't say they weren't.

320
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:59,239
Scott: I'm just saying no reason to be outraged You know, that's something.

321
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:01,472
Scott: you point out and go, uh-huh Not something.

322
00:23:01,492 --> 00:23:07,150
Rym: you go ravel ravel ravel, but the internet all the internet can only go ravel ravel ravel.

323
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,338
Rym: It has no other unified cause.

324
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,702
Rym: there is no way to harness.

325
00:23:10,743 --> 00:23:11,405
Scott: it can also go.

326
00:23:11,445 --> 00:23:11,766
Scott: Hooray.

327
00:23:11,806 --> 00:23:16,644
Scott: Hooray But that happens so rarely and among very small time Steve Jobs opens his mouth.

328
00:23:17,085 --> 00:23:18,310
Rym: No, but that's just the Apple people.

329
00:23:18,651 --> 00:23:26,537
Rym: Yeah, there's all these different stands in the internet and they can all hooray hooray about individual things But they never hooray hooray with one voice.

330
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,490
Scott: I think there would be a unified hooray hooray if something big happened.

331
00:23:30,939 --> 00:23:31,429
Rym: I don't know.

332
00:23:31,671 --> 00:23:34,430
Rym: I think the only thing that can pull out of Iraq or something.

333
00:23:34,992 --> 00:23:39,428
Rym: No, because you realize that half of the internet is filled with those people don't know how to use the internet.

334
00:23:39,548 --> 00:23:40,010
Rym: Yeah, they do.

335
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:46,910
Rym: Granted there's the possibility the internet that those people are all trolls that everyone you disagree with is a troll.

336
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:52,388
Scott: Someone trolling counts as hooray hooray because they're getting a lot of enjoyment out of it.

337
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:55,660
Rym: Well, I thought I've never seen the internet.

338
00:23:56,161 --> 00:23:58,730
Rym: you combine and be positive about something.

339
00:23:59,051 --> 00:24:01,439
Scott: I have however about the existence of the internet.

340
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,349
Rym: No because a lot of people who are on the internet hate the internet.

341
00:24:05,552 --> 00:24:06,216
Scott: You get off.

342
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,086
Scott: I mean no one's making you.

343
00:24:08,388 --> 00:24:10,474
Rym: actually I'm not gonna.

344
00:24:10,535 --> 00:24:17,654
Rym: I'm not gonna tell this whole little anecdote, but the other day at work I was talking to a doctor who was kind of a Luddite who didn't even work for the place I worked for.

345
00:24:17,734 --> 00:24:35,070
Rym: I just met him in the street outside of some other hospital and They were complaining into a cell phone about cell phones and people talking on them in public And I just stared at this woman like do you even understand the words that are coming out of your mouth?

346
00:24:37,391 --> 00:24:38,495
Scott: That's pretty funny right there.

347
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:46,381
Scott: that's like typing into a website man, I hate the Internet Man, I hate podcasts.

348
00:24:46,763 --> 00:24:47,970
Rym: Well, I do hate podcast.

349
00:24:49,231 --> 00:24:55,129
Rym: Dave and Joel are a podcast for people who hate anime and video games and a podcast.

350
00:24:55,189 --> 00:24:57,317
Rym: Yes We just hate podcasts.

351
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,807
Scott: Yeah, although I hate almost everything.

352
00:24:59,867 --> 00:25:08,326
Rym: It's just Things of the day.

353
00:25:08,346 --> 00:25:12,017
Rym: It's a video kittens a robotic mouse and a mirror.

354
00:25:12,097 --> 00:25:13,080
Rym: That's really all I can say.

355
00:25:13,482 --> 00:25:16,939
Scott: Alright my video is a cow and a swimming pool.

356
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,409
Rym: That's pretty self-explanatory.

357
00:25:19,429 --> 00:25:21,620
Scott: No, but here's the thing about this video, right?

358
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,179
Scott: I'm looking at the cow in the swimming pool and I'm like, how are you gonna get that cow out of the swimming pool?

359
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,345
Rym: Well with the crane.

360
00:25:28,846 --> 00:25:30,472
Rym: No, you drain the pool.

361
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,077
Scott: No draining the pool.

362
00:25:32,138 --> 00:25:32,659
Scott: Now, what do you do?

363
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,264
Rym: Then you let him out with the crane.

364
00:25:34,585 --> 00:25:36,051
Rym: No, you kill him.

365
00:25:36,633 --> 00:25:36,773
Scott: No.

366
00:25:36,793 --> 00:25:38,640
Rym: All right, how do they get the cow out of the swimming?

367
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:53,699
Scott: I'm not gonna tell you that's a surprise But all I'm gonna point out is that Basically, they call the police as you would probably do and then the police calls the farmer and the farmer comes and the farmer knows Exactly what to do and gets the cow out quickly and easily

368
00:25:54,443 --> 00:25:54,985
Rym: Uh-huh.

369
00:25:55,145 --> 00:25:57,334
Rym: Does he trick the cow into getting out of its own volition?

370
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:58,659
Rym: Nope, huh?

371
00:25:59,982 --> 00:26:02,740
Rym: It's pretty it was the farmers Superman.

372
00:26:03,316 --> 00:26:10,997
Scott: No The farmer just really must fucking know about cows and I guess that's what it's like when I go to someone's house and fix their Computer now, I guess so.

373
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:15,500
Scott: Yeah Watch this and if you're not a farmer if you're a farmer you go.

374
00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:16,506
Scott: I know how to do it.

375
00:26:16,546 --> 00:26:17,613
Scott: If you're not a farmer you go.

376
00:26:17,975 --> 00:26:18,699
Scott: Ah, well, look at that.

377
00:26:19,121 --> 00:26:19,744
Scott: It's like I couldn't.

378
00:26:19,764 --> 00:26:20,749
Scott: I couldn't think of this.

379
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:26,859
Scott: and you know while the video played for about two minutes I couldn't think of how they were gonna do it and then there were that they just did it.

380
00:26:27,422 --> 00:26:30,635
Rym: I'm gonna try to guess before I watch the video and I suggest you all do the same.

381
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:31,800
Scott: Yeah, it's a fun game.

382
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:38,530
Scott: Think about guess how to get the cow out of the pool and then after about a minute You'll see the answer floaties and put them under him.

383
00:26:39,092 --> 00:26:39,755
Scott: That's a good one.

384
00:26:39,775 --> 00:26:40,659
Scott: But no, all right.

385
00:26:41,673 --> 00:26:59,997
Rym: so every now and then we do a show on people or things or places we dislike and Near the very top of the list Near the very it's pretty much like Nazis homeo Pitti homeopathy people Nazis flim-flam medicine people.

386
00:27:00,098 --> 00:27:07,051
Scott: Yep Ignorant people who are also indignant and then Two groups of people that sort of go hand in hand.

387
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:07,513
Rym: Yes.

388
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,500
Rym: Now what we were referring to?

389
00:27:09,722 --> 00:27:10,980
Rym: I don't know if you've heard this term before.

390
00:27:11,121 --> 00:27:16,220
Rym: I don't know if this is just an Americanism or if it's in the rest of the world, but it'll be quite anyway.

391
00:27:16,341 --> 00:27:17,854
Scott: It's only places that speak English.

392
00:27:18,882 --> 00:27:22,880
Scott: It's obvious an acronym of English words, but there might be similar terms in other places.

393
00:27:23,201 --> 00:27:38,700
Rym: Yeah, but then again, they're also places like China where the government just basically says, you know what fuck you all here comes We're talking about are the nimby's and Why not in my backyard and also the bananas.

394
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,956
Scott: Absolutely, nothing anywhere near anyone.

395
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,505
Rym: now They used to be just nimby's.

396
00:27:45,565 --> 00:27:46,989
Rym: banana is a fairly recent term.

397
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:53,849
Rym: that I think really rather fits because the heart of this issue The very very core to put it in no uncertain terms.

398
00:27:54,290 --> 00:28:00,106
Rym: Is that in America people let's use electricity as an example People want electricity.

399
00:28:00,528 --> 00:28:01,932
Rym: They need electricity.

400
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:04,300
Rym: They cannot live without electricity.

401
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,860
Scott: Well, they can live without electricity, but they will live very unhappily without electricity.

402
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:14,952
Rym: well They effectively you cannot exist in America without electricity and still be connected.

403
00:28:14,992 --> 00:28:18,100
Scott: American lifestyle and society cannot exist without electricity.

404
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:24,880
Rym: I mean even body can live but pretty much even the the deeply impoverished most times have electricity.

405
00:28:25,101 --> 00:28:25,663
Rym: Yeah, it is it.

406
00:28:25,864 --> 00:28:26,666
Rym: everyone needs it.

407
00:28:26,787 --> 00:28:27,590
Rym: Everyone wants it.

408
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,252
Rym: It is there.

409
00:28:28,533 --> 00:28:30,420
Rym: It is a necessity of life for most people.

410
00:28:30,701 --> 00:28:36,900
Rym: Yep, now electricity has to be made in something called a power plant.

411
00:28:37,362 --> 00:28:48,240
Rym: Now this could be coal nuclear natural gas solar tidal whatever wind geothermal fusion cold fusion microwave.

412
00:28:51,337 --> 00:28:59,434
Rym: But The fact remains that like it's in city You gotta build it somewhere because you see you need a power plant to make the electricity.

413
00:28:59,855 --> 00:29:01,740
Rym: now here in lies the crux of the issue.

414
00:29:02,505 --> 00:29:04,760
Rym: Most Americans want electricity.

415
00:29:05,322 --> 00:29:08,753
Rym: However, they do not want a power plant to be there near them.

416
00:29:09,194 --> 00:29:10,900
Rym: They want it to be somewhere else.

417
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,904
Rym: They don't care where.

418
00:29:12,165 --> 00:29:13,972
Rym: they just don't want it in their backyard.

419
00:29:14,012 --> 00:29:15,076
Rym: They don't want it in their town.

420
00:29:15,097 --> 00:29:15,860
Rym: They don't want to see it.

421
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:24,700
Scott: Yes, and if you play Sim City, this is pretty obvious and if you think about it, you know I don't want really you don't want your house next to a coal power plant.

422
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:34,940
Scott: If there's a coal power plant right next to a house in Sim City The houses don't get populated because no one wants to fucking live with all this coal smoke coming into their lungs, right?

423
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:46,027
Scott: I wouldn't want to live next to a coal power plant either but at the same time the power plant has to go somewhere Someone occupy like the fourth dimension.

424
00:29:46,448 --> 00:29:47,632
Scott: it has to be somewhere.

425
00:29:48,093 --> 00:29:48,755
Rym: so think of this.

426
00:29:49,176 --> 00:29:52,806
Rym: everyone wants the power plant But no one wants it in their town.

427
00:29:53,207 --> 00:30:06,356
Rym: There's nowhere to put the power plant and as a result large patches of America the United States Require services or have deficiencies that could be easily solved by everyone in the world.

428
00:30:06,376 --> 00:30:19,020
Rym: that the economics are right The demand is there the money is there the resources the land everything is great Except the people everywhere do not want these things to be built near them and thus these things don't get built.

429
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,428
Rym: Yeah, and thus we don't build new power plants often.

430
00:30:21,448 --> 00:30:22,873
Rym: We don't build nuclear power plants.

431
00:30:23,074 --> 00:30:23,957
Rym: We don't build trains.

432
00:30:23,997 --> 00:30:25,745
Rym: We don't build freeways We don't build anything.

433
00:30:25,765 --> 00:30:28,260
Scott: I mean look in Sim City right in Sim City.

434
00:30:28,641 --> 00:30:33,780
Scott: Okay, obviously if you build the coal power plant right next to the residential area, it doesn't work out so well, right?

435
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,233
Scott: But if you build it in the industrial area, it works.

436
00:30:37,313 --> 00:30:38,800
Scott: It's far enough away from the houses.

437
00:30:38,941 --> 00:30:43,380
Scott: It's radius of effect doesn't get over any residential zones only industrial zones.

438
00:30:43,821 --> 00:30:48,476
Scott: So the game doesn't punish you in any way because people don't care if it's far enough away.

439
00:30:48,918 --> 00:30:49,640
Scott: in this country.

440
00:30:50,503 --> 00:30:56,120
Scott: It seems like a lot of people now if they know it's there even if it's like in another state.

441
00:30:56,361 --> 00:30:57,604
Scott: They still don't like it.

442
00:30:57,865 --> 00:31:03,440
Scott: They want to build absolutely nothing anywhere near anyone not just not in my backyard.

443
00:31:04,144 --> 00:31:06,800
Scott: They don't want it built but they want the electricity.

444
00:31:07,362 --> 00:31:17,355
Rym: Now the funny thing is these are people I think the worst example of it other than the wind power thing that Emily Went into in great detail a while ago our cell towers cellular phone towers.

445
00:31:17,515 --> 00:31:21,309
Rym: That's my number one thing because Everyone needs cell phones.

446
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:21,913
Rym: in America.

447
00:31:21,953 --> 00:31:23,120
Rym: just about it's getting to that point.

448
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,671
Scott: Everyone complains that their cell phone cuts out.

449
00:31:25,711 --> 00:31:27,680
Scott: they complain that their cell phone coverage is shitty.

450
00:31:28,003 --> 00:31:32,131
Scott: They complain that cell phone data isn't fast And it's a plane that cell phones aren't cheap enough.

451
00:31:32,373 --> 00:31:40,040
Rym: like when I lived up in the mountains There wasn't enough cell coverage, so there were a lot of dead spots and the house I was living in just didn't get cell service.

452
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:47,528
Scott: I had to drive down the mountain to get cell service and people don't realize that in order to have cell coverage You need a tower that's connected to the.

453
00:31:47,648 --> 00:31:50,776
Scott: you know the network that has big radios on it now.

454
00:31:50,816 --> 00:31:54,607
Rym: the people in this fucking town Complained about the cell service all the time.

455
00:31:54,888 --> 00:31:57,114
Rym: they complained to Verizon they complained to Sprint.

456
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,778
Rym: they banded together and wrote petitions How they wanted their cell service to be better?

457
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:02,806
Rym: Verizon said all right.

458
00:32:03,308 --> 00:32:13,799
Rym: We'll build a cell tower there and the town said oh no no no You can't build your cancer-causing cell tower in our town the cell tower that doesn't actually cause cancer or harm you in any way.

459
00:32:13,819 --> 00:32:20,760
Rym: cell Tower where there's no evidence of any harm whatsoever where in fact It's just off in the distance on the peak of the mountain, and I think looks rather pretty.

460
00:32:21,101 --> 00:32:25,160
Scott: It's just a metal tower that's standing over there somewhere.

461
00:32:25,321 --> 00:32:26,626
Scott: It doesn't hurt you in any way.

462
00:32:26,686 --> 00:32:34,431
Scott: sure if you got right up next to it and like you climbed up it while it was Then yes It would probably hurt you because the radio waves are pretty powerful.

463
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:37,903
Scott: if you're just standing across the street from it You are.

464
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:46,835
Scott: unless you stand there for like hours and hours and hours and like you get some Reflectors to aim the radio waves at you or something like that it basically can't hurt you.

465
00:32:46,955 --> 00:32:49,759
Scott: anyone who says that it can hurt you Is full of shit now?

466
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:50,944
Rym: Here's the better part.

467
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:55,660
Rym: they didn't even complain so much about how they think they're dangerous.

468
00:32:56,181 --> 00:33:01,110
Rym: The primary complaint was that they will spoil the view that they look ugly.

469
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:10,360
Rym: Now I've noticed that the people who say that these sorts of things look ugly Have no problem with power lines because power lines have been around a long time.

470
00:33:10,761 --> 00:33:17,592
Rym: I think the real heart is that a lot of people are comfortable only with things that they're used to and are afraid of new things.

471
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:22,359
Scott: well is a good example that Shows that that exactly what you said is true.

472
00:33:22,841 --> 00:33:28,460
Scott: There was a I think I'm not remember the exact details of this story, but I know it's a true story.

473
00:33:28,501 --> 00:33:33,334
Scott: There was some city and they wanted to put up like a like a bull a billboard with like some lights.

474
00:33:33,495 --> 00:33:43,612
Scott: it was like a big gaudy kind of thing right and When they wanted to put it up way back in the day right people fought it and fought it and fought it and said don't You put up that gaudy thing don't you put that up?

475
00:33:43,893 --> 00:33:44,537
Scott: and they got it.

476
00:33:44,598 --> 00:33:44,920
Scott: put up.

477
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,559
Scott: They the people who wanted it got it and the people who didn't want it got pissed off.

478
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:56,366
Scott: But after time the people realized they couldn't do anything about it, and they just remained pissed off until they died Like 50 years later.

479
00:33:56,386 --> 00:34:00,920
Scott: You know when the thing had been around for a while people said you can't get rid of that.

480
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,165
Scott: That's like a part of the city.

481
00:34:02,225 --> 00:34:05,518
Scott: It's like it's it's yeah, and they didn't want to get rid of it.

482
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:07,137
Scott: Huh, huh?

483
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,696
Scott: Maybe it wasn't gaudy or in the way actually change that upset at them.

484
00:34:12,897 --> 00:34:16,320
Rym: the same thing Happened Probably to a lesser extent.

485
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:28,800
Rym: I don't know all the details, but when the Eiffel Tower was built a lot of people living in the area Saw it as this gigantic monstrosity this ugly ugly just black hideous thing they wanted to turn down.

486
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,784
Scott: I think it was a monstrosity.

487
00:34:30,025 --> 00:34:32,920
Rym: Yeah, but a lot of people just they didn't like it.

488
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:40,639
Rym: It was like this eyesore and now the Eiffel Tower is probably like the ride up from the ultimate icon of France.

489
00:34:41,722 --> 00:34:47,346
Scott: Yeah, they gave us the better statue though dumbasses yeah Themselves a plain metal tower.

490
00:34:47,406 --> 00:34:54,157
Scott: We got a lady with a torch and lights and stuff real smart Thanks, we win you lose.

491
00:34:55,731 --> 00:35:01,200
Rym: Yeah The just people want things, but they're not willing to deal with the consequence of the things.

492
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:01,601
Rym: I mean.

493
00:35:02,164 --> 00:35:03,810
Rym: and the worst part is all right.

494
00:35:04,151 --> 00:35:06,400
Rym: so say you try to build something off in the middle of nowhere.

495
00:35:06,884 --> 00:35:08,900
Rym: Then they complain that you're ruining the natural environment.

496
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:11,428
Rym: So then say you try to build it bikes up.

497
00:35:11,749 --> 00:35:14,958
Rym: all right environmentalist to complain about coal power and nuclear power and whatever.

498
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,088
Rym: fine We'll build air power.

499
00:35:17,108 --> 00:35:19,159
Rym: air power is perfectly clean.

500
00:35:19,762 --> 00:35:24,960
Rym: It's probably it's exactly what they want, but they don't want the turbines because they say it'll kill the birds.

501
00:35:25,241 --> 00:35:26,206
Scott: It doesn't kill the birds.

502
00:35:26,447 --> 00:35:28,276
Scott: Yeah, I mean and it also they complain.

503
00:35:28,296 --> 00:35:29,060
Scott: It's makes noise.

504
00:35:29,261 --> 00:35:34,040
Rym: Well, yeah, it makes noise, but not that much noise and only if you're standing right next to it.

505
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,751
Scott: Yeah, if it's kind of far away.

506
00:35:35,993 --> 00:35:36,979
Scott: It's not you're not gonna hear it.

507
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:40,010
Rym: I mean back in a Rochester Emily.

508
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,415
Scott: I mean a hydroelectric dam.

509
00:35:41,455 --> 00:35:42,840
Scott: now that makes some fucking noise.

510
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:44,126
Rym: There were a bunch of people.

511
00:35:44,146 --> 00:35:50,958
Rym: they like they want to build a big wind farm out there and a lot of people started getting together and protesting it.

512
00:35:50,979 --> 00:35:57,280
Rym: and Most of these people happen to be wealthy people who own land and were worried about property values and BS like that.

513
00:35:57,802 --> 00:36:00,414
Rym: Well, I think the lady who was like the forefront of it didn't even live there.

514
00:36:00,454 --> 00:36:01,739
Rym: She just owned the land or something.

515
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,440
Rym: But their arguments were absurd.

516
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:16,060
Rym: one of the arguments they made against them was that the Rotating blades if the shadow passed over someone's window could with the alternating light and dark cause epileptic seizures.

517
00:36:16,181 --> 00:36:16,747
Scott: No, I can't.

518
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:17,939
Rym: that's just crazy.

519
00:36:18,822 --> 00:36:26,110
Rym: One gentleman in an open letter said that the sounds that they make when you're standing right next to him Which is kind of this low groaning.

520
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,900
Rym: I think it's a kind of interesting sound.

521
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,739
Rym: I like it and also you have to be really close to it to hear it.

522
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,979
Scott: Yeah, you got to be like standing next to the thing to hear it.

523
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,799
Rym: He said that the noise they make reminded him too much of the concentration camps.

524
00:36:40,425 --> 00:36:42,985
Scott: Yeah, yeah, yeah Godwin's law you lose.

525
00:36:43,247 --> 00:36:43,528
Rym: Yeah.

526
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:43,890
Rym: Yeah.

527
00:36:44,051 --> 00:36:45,660
Rym: Well Godwin's law doesn't state that you lose.

528
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,914
Rym: It just states that the probability of Nazis being brought up approaches one.

529
00:36:49,195 --> 00:36:50,280
Scott: Yeah, and then it's over.

530
00:36:50,703 --> 00:36:52,173
Rym: Well, no, not that it's over just that's it.

531
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:53,039
Rym: Nazis get brought up.

532
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,335
Rym: Yeah, I guess there are corollaries that say then you lose or whatever.

533
00:36:56,416 --> 00:37:02,416
Scott: But yeah Anyway, these people all need to learn two words that I have to tell them.

534
00:37:02,456 --> 00:37:02,537
Scott: you.

535
00:37:02,557 --> 00:37:03,440
Scott: ready for the two words?

536
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:05,125
Scott: I'm ready tough shit.

537
00:37:05,827 --> 00:37:06,690
Rym: Uh, I don't know.

538
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:07,031
Rym: I have them.

539
00:37:07,151 --> 00:37:09,920
Rym: I have a much different set of two words cost-benefit.

540
00:37:10,881 --> 00:37:16,700
Rym: It seems that people want things but aren't willing to actually consider the consequences or the prices.

541
00:37:17,022 --> 00:37:18,511
Rym: You can't get anything for free.

542
00:37:18,773 --> 00:37:21,940
Rym: the laws of thermodynamics State that the world is a zero-sum game.

543
00:37:22,221 --> 00:37:26,360
Rym: The universe as far as we've been able to tell for as long as we've existed is a zero-sum game.

544
00:37:26,823 --> 00:37:32,133
Rym: anything you want cost something and People want things but they don't want to pay.

545
00:37:32,535 --> 00:37:33,320
Rym: they want electricity.

546
00:37:33,661 --> 00:37:36,370
Rym: Alright build a coal power plant, but coal makes pollution.

547
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:39,140
Rym: fine build a nuclear power plant, but nuclear radiation.

548
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:39,702
Rym: OMG.

549
00:37:40,003 --> 00:37:44,680
Rym: fine build a hydroelectric plant, but they're loud and they screw up rivers and we already built them all.

550
00:37:45,161 --> 00:37:46,485
Rym: Oh fine build a win air plant.

551
00:37:46,746 --> 00:37:48,150
Rym: No, it'll kill the birds.

552
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,373
Rym: fine build a solar plant.

553
00:37:49,493 --> 00:37:50,436
Rym: No, they're expensive.

554
00:37:50,657 --> 00:37:51,800
Rym: fine build a natural gas plant.

555
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,107
Rym: No, they're even more expensive.

556
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,515
Rym: There's no more options.

557
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,138
Rym: That's it.

558
00:37:55,921 --> 00:38:00,497
Rym: It's either pick one of them or it's not like there's an option that satisfies you and us.

559
00:38:00,998 --> 00:38:01,480
Rym: tough shit.

560
00:38:01,682 --> 00:38:02,960
Rym: You have to make a compromise.

561
00:38:03,221 --> 00:38:09,130
Rym: You have to decide what price you were going to pay for that Electricity and people are just too stupid to realize it.

562
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:12,902
Rym: and it really bothers me if you can't tell because I haven't breathed in The last minute.

563
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:18,700
Scott: Yeah, basically, I think that the government just has to eminent domain a lot more.

564
00:38:19,142 --> 00:38:20,429
Scott: yes, eminent domain a lot more.

565
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:29,339
Scott: the problem is is You want a government that does things that are in the best interest of the people but you you sort of have.

566
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,554
Scott: That's why we have a representative government as opposed to a pure democracy.

567
00:38:32,574 --> 00:38:38,860
Scott: because of the pure democracy We wouldn't be able to do anything in the best interest of the people when the people don't know what's in their own best interest.

568
00:38:39,061 --> 00:38:43,999
Rym: I believe the words we're looking for are the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few exactly.

569
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:50,480
Scott: but The problem is is a lot of these nimby banana issues are very local issues.

570
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,780
Scott: They're usually on the town or state level.

571
00:38:52,961 --> 00:38:58,779
Scott: Usually they're not sort of federal issues where the you know The government can kind of go ha take that and there's nothing you could do about it.

572
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:05,939
Scott: right because there's so because the you know, there's so many the whole country's voting and only your town says no you lose.

573
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:16,220
Scott: or The whole state is voting and only your County says no you lose when it's a local issue and the mayor says no This wind farm is better for our town and the mayor does it.

574
00:39:17,182 --> 00:39:21,873
Scott: The mayor loses the election and then the next mayor takes down the wind farm.

575
00:39:22,134 --> 00:39:30,460
Scott: waste everyone's money taking down the wind farm and The people vote for that mayor again and again and their town continues to suck and suck, but they're still happy.

576
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:33,399
Rym: Yep, and this happens with everything like where we live now.

577
00:39:33,882 --> 00:39:46,728
Rym: there's really only one north-south road and there's really only one east-west road and Traffic is getting worse and worse as more and more people move to this area and a lot of people are saying hey Let's stop letting people move to the air.

578
00:39:46,748 --> 00:39:49,016
Rym: Yeah, they don't say alright, how can we fix the roads?

579
00:39:49,257 --> 00:39:50,160
Rym: maybe mass transit?

580
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,900
Rym: Maybe a freeway maybe some sort of solution?

581
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:58,200
Rym: No, just well, let's just buy up all the land and not let people move here because that'll work in the long run.

582
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:03,316
Scott: Yeah, and maybe they they don't even stop to think uh, then our economy will suck.

583
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:06,026
Scott: if we let these people move It'll be awesome for us.

584
00:40:06,107 --> 00:40:07,553
Scott: No, they just don't want anything to change.

585
00:40:08,035 --> 00:40:09,060
Scott: They don't want anyone to move there.

586
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:09,543
Scott: They don't want it.

587
00:40:09,563 --> 00:40:11,840
Scott: They want it to be the way it is and never have anything change.

588
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,887
Scott: Yep, don't cut down a single tree.

589
00:40:13,987 --> 00:40:15,272
Scott: Don't lay a single brick.

590
00:40:15,352 --> 00:40:16,095
Scott: Don't do anything.

591
00:40:16,436 --> 00:40:16,837
Scott: Let's have it.

592
00:40:16,877 --> 00:40:17,540
Scott: stay this way.

593
00:40:17,641 --> 00:40:23,320
Scott: It's like in the year 2500 when there's all these Jetsons towers your town will still be sitting down there.

594
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,453
Scott: You'll be an old man living in your same cruddy house.

595
00:40:25,936 --> 00:40:26,640
Scott: Nothing changed.

596
00:40:26,781 --> 00:40:31,609
Rym: I mean, I think you have to strike a balance because I think keeping Relics of history is important.

597
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:32,071
Scott: Of course.

598
00:40:32,091 --> 00:40:35,608
Scott: I mean, of course, it's like if you don't knock I'm not saying we got a world here.

599
00:40:35,628 --> 00:40:38,500
Rym: Yeah, you don't knock down the Colosseum in Rome to build a new condo.

600
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:44,940
Rym: No, but at the same time if you have 40 Colosseum's keep one of them like the New York City.

601
00:40:45,321 --> 00:40:50,380
Rym: They build brand new buildings all over the place because old old skyscrapers suck, but you know what?

602
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:54,491
Rym: They're probably never gonna tear down the Flatiron building because that was the first skyscraper.

603
00:40:54,632 --> 00:40:57,300
Scott: Yeah, like that's our estate building isn't going anywhere.

604
00:40:57,561 --> 00:41:03,240
Scott: Yeah, but you know what that cruddy random building that no one cares about on like X Street.

605
00:41:03,662 --> 00:41:07,020
Scott: If someone buys that building and has enough money you bet your ass.

606
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:10,595
Scott: they're gonna tear it down if they can and pay someone to build it back up.

607
00:41:10,695 --> 00:41:11,097
Scott: and you know what.

608
00:41:11,137 --> 00:41:18,180
Scott: that's good because jobs for the construction workers What the building now has can fit more things in it and it's taller.

609
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:22,940
Scott: So you get more business more people can be around there and it's just better for everybody.

610
00:41:23,241 --> 00:41:27,235
Scott: Some guy is basically investing money in that spot and that's just.

611
00:41:27,536 --> 00:41:28,420
Scott: that makes things go.

612
00:41:28,782 --> 00:41:31,579
Scott: That's what makes things good is when people spend money on stuff.

613
00:41:31,981 --> 00:41:37,982
Rym: I think my favorite point about this whole issue it always comes back to the cell towers people.

614
00:41:38,022 --> 00:41:41,639
Rym: the primary complaint regardless of what people say is always that they don't like the way they look.

615
00:41:41,659 --> 00:41:45,820
Rym: and First I'll make my logical argument and then I'll make my funny argument the tree.

616
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,821
Rym: Yeah the tree.

617
00:41:47,062 --> 00:41:59,320
Rym: the logical argument is simply that to me as a technologist and a futurist and someone who I guess I Don't want to say that I'm more in tune or I'm more enlightened because that sort of thing is really pretentious and crappy to say.

618
00:42:00,002 --> 00:42:02,671
Rym: but you got to at least be a little bit forward-thinking.

619
00:42:02,992 --> 00:42:16,515
Rym: and when I see a cell tower or a new Technology or a new freeway or a new maglev train or something like that being built or I see a wind farm on the horizon I don't think ah that ugly new thing marring the landscape.

620
00:42:16,555 --> 00:42:20,715
Rym: I think wow Look at all that science and progress sitting right there.

621
00:42:20,735 --> 00:42:22,282
Rym: That's the future May.

622
00:42:22,322 --> 00:42:25,094
Scott: I go to the city every day and I just like look at something right.

623
00:42:25,114 --> 00:42:30,284
Scott: you look at a building and the building's made of like a bajillion bricks and you go People made that.

624
00:42:30,605 --> 00:42:35,944
Scott: not only that people made that like 50 years ago and you look at the whole thing and you're like people made that.

625
00:42:36,406 --> 00:42:43,799
Scott: when I look think about what we had to do to make that when I look and there's Like a thousand more of them and you're like, how the fuck did we do that?

626
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:50,403
Rym: Look at this when I look up at the top of mountain beacon at night and I see all those blinking glistening cell towers and Communication towers.

627
00:42:50,844 --> 00:42:53,712
Rym: I don't think they've just foiled the beauty of mountain beacon.

628
00:42:53,752 --> 00:42:57,583
Rym: I think wow, that's how my cell service works That's that's it.

629
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:00,131
Rym: That's how I communicate with the world right there.

630
00:43:00,232 --> 00:43:00,954
Rym: I can see it.

631
00:43:01,255 --> 00:43:02,760
Rym: That is a monument to technology.

632
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:07,417
Scott: Yeah, when I see a cell tower, I'm like, yes data's I need them.

633
00:43:07,438 --> 00:43:19,411
Rym: now normal people seem to think about this on a much baser level because the solution that has been used at least in downstate New York, and I've seen him in other places too is All right build a cell tower.

634
00:43:19,552 --> 00:43:19,994
Rym: It's ugly.

635
00:43:20,034 --> 00:43:20,920
Rym: It looks like a cell tower.

636
00:43:21,382 --> 00:43:23,976
Rym: What if we made it looks like something natural like say a tree.

637
00:43:24,237 --> 00:43:24,720
Scott: that's fine.

638
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:29,140
Scott: If you have like a big, you know tree thing that they've it actually looks like a tree.

639
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,344
Rym: What if we camouflage it?

640
00:43:30,785 --> 00:43:33,635
Rym: So, uh, I'm driving down 84 toward Connecticut.

641
00:43:33,676 --> 00:43:34,278
Scott: It's on the hutch.

642
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:35,503
Rym: Yeah Well, no, there's.

643
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:37,011
Rym: there's one on 84.

644
00:43:37,011 --> 00:43:38,780
Scott: The hutch one is the biggest most gaudy one.

645
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:42,517
Scott: Yeah, the one right after 9 the one on the hutch at the like the New York Connecticut border.

646
00:43:42,557 --> 00:43:42,798
Scott: Yep.

647
00:43:42,859 --> 00:43:46,280
Rym: Yep Yep, where it hits like 287 when I go over to hit and then pass that one.

648
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:51,200
Scott: 684 that's yeah, we're 684 and the hutch meet at the corner of New York and Connecticut.

649
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,311
Scott: But I was working at Mount Vernon.

650
00:43:52,351 --> 00:43:53,159
Rym: I was over there a lot.

651
00:43:54,161 --> 00:44:00,560
Rym: Here's the scene you're driving and you see the tree line along the hills this gigantic just line of trees.

652
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,100
Rym: They're all about the same height and they all look about the same because they're all you know pine trees.

653
00:44:05,002 --> 00:44:14,520
Rym: And in the midst of them is one gigantic ugly motherfucking tree That's twice as tall as all the other twice as tall as all the other ones twice as thick and incredibly sparse.

654
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:21,180
Rym: It has these sparse obviously fake metal looking leaves on it and an antenna sticking out of it and it's painted brown.

655
00:44:21,882 --> 00:44:22,824
Rym: Who's that fooling?

656
00:44:23,305 --> 00:44:28,920
Rym: that looks a lot worse than a sleek shining like red and green cell tower with lights on it.

657
00:44:29,423 --> 00:44:30,390
Rym: It just looks stupid.

658
00:44:30,974 --> 00:44:31,840
Scott: It's really stupid.

659
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:35,300
Scott: Maybe I should like we can find a picture of one of these things to show you how stupid it is.

660
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,161
Rym: I mean good It just.

661
00:44:36,242 --> 00:44:46,460
Scott: they wasted money and resources on making that cell tower look like a fake tree Where they could have spent those money resources on another cell tower down the road where there's no service.

662
00:44:47,817 --> 00:44:51,600
Scott: Ah Now it's not just for me the nimby's and the bananas.

663
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:58,640
Scott: It's not just you know The government wants to build something or we need a public service or someone wants to build a new business or a housing development, right?

664
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:06,480
Scott: It's also within It's people against each other and not it necessarily against companies or the government.

665
00:45:06,781 --> 00:45:12,880
Rym: It's whenever someone has a decision to make and just doesn't actually make the decision or doesn't actually think about it

666
00:45:13,101 --> 00:45:22,292
Scott: Like somewhat like for example if I want to build a garage the law says I have to ask my fucking neighbor Why the fuck should my neighbor get to say what I build on my lawn?

667
00:45:22,332 --> 00:45:24,480
Rym: Well that only matters if you live in some stupid.

668
00:45:25,961 --> 00:45:27,607
Rym: We'll talk about that in another show.

669
00:45:27,627 --> 00:45:28,711
Scott: You want to talk about another show?

670
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:29,654
Rym: Homeowners agreements?

671
00:45:29,815 --> 00:45:30,939
Scott: Homeowners associations?

672
00:45:30,999 --> 00:45:32,143
Rym: Yes That's the other show.

673
00:45:32,223 --> 00:45:40,973
Scott: Basically a homeowner's association is if you live somewhere in which there is a homeowner's association You are not allowed to live there unless you join this agreement.

674
00:45:41,093 --> 00:45:41,816
Scott: and then because

675
00:45:41,977 --> 00:45:43,607
Rym: it's tied to the land In most cases

676
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:56,860
Scott: and if you join the agreement You're basically agreeing that any rule the homeowner's association comes up with you have to follow Which basically means a bunch of people who live where you live and have nothing better to do because they have no job.

677
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:07,100
Rym: Yeah, the only people who actually work and run the homeowner's associations not to sound stereotypical It's always old and bittered people with nothing better to do and no jobs.

678
00:46:07,361 --> 00:46:12,820
Rym: Well, basically and they always make the meetings at like two o'clock on Wednesdays So all the working people can't show up to them.

679
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:20,960
Scott: Yep and they will just Decide on rules and then you must follow them or you can't live there and they can just kick you out and do a whole Bunch of nasty things to you and they'll make rules.

680
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:29,628
Scott: Like you have to bring your trash can in back by a certain time or else you pay a fine or you're not allowed to Park a car in your driveway.

681
00:46:29,689 --> 00:46:31,275
Scott: All your cars have to be in the garage.

682
00:46:31,396 --> 00:46:33,960
Scott: if you can't have car You can't have more than X cars.

683
00:46:34,261 --> 00:46:36,307
Scott: You can't have a car more than X years old.

684
00:46:36,749 --> 00:46:40,762
Scott: if you you have to replace your roof every three years whether it needs repairing Or not.

685
00:46:41,003 --> 00:46:42,369
Scott: your house can't be that color.

686
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:43,976
Scott: You can't make an addition to your house.

687
00:46:44,016 --> 00:46:44,820
Scott: You can't build a porch.

688
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,605
Scott: You can't have a pool.

689
00:46:45,665 --> 00:46:46,570
Scott: you can't remember.

690
00:46:46,791 --> 00:46:47,777
Scott: you're in you to do this.

691
00:46:47,817 --> 00:46:48,159
Scott: you do that.

692
00:46:48,902 --> 00:46:50,688
Scott: What the fuck you I'm telling you.

693
00:46:50,728 --> 00:46:52,856
Scott: don't tell me what I can do to my house.

694
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:58,131
Scott: All right, fuck you I don't care if you have to look at my house and you look out your window.

695
00:46:58,352 --> 00:47:00,038
Scott: That's tough shit.

696
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,499
Rym: now I realize just cuz we've gone long but we talked.

697
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:06,740
Rym: you know We kind of listed in order the people we dislike and I realized something frightening.

698
00:47:07,201 --> 00:47:15,078
Rym: There is almost nothing more disturbing to me in the world than an indignant NIMBY dump dump dump indignant banana.

699
00:47:20,302 --> 00:47:23,313
Rym: The phrase indignant banana just strikes me as being wonderful.

700
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:25,060
Scott: Yeah, I just need I see like this banana.

701
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:28,517
Scott: He was about to do some peanut butter jelly time, but instead he does something else.

702
00:47:28,598 --> 00:47:29,080
Scott: It's not good.

703
00:47:29,562 --> 00:47:33,275
Scott: He says you can't build ten cell towers.

704
00:47:33,877 --> 00:47:34,640
Rym: I think we're done.

705
