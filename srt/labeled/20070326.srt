1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,698
Rym: It's Monday March 26th.

2
00:00:11,858 --> 00:00:13,122
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,443 --> 00:00:15,549
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,170
Rym: tonight We talk in layman's terms a bit about encryption.

5
00:00:21,392 --> 00:00:22,407
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,512 --> 00:00:35,589
Rym: So all the grocery stores near our house kind of suck well relative to all the places We've lived before in our lives this area mostly It's just that they're not open 24 by 7 which is this alien concept to me.

7
00:00:36,252 --> 00:00:39,521
Scott: That and they also are far away from our house.

8
00:00:39,722 --> 00:00:43,674
Scott: like usually a grocery store should be able to get to with like Less than five minutes.

9
00:00:44,156 --> 00:00:44,356
Rym: No.

10
00:00:44,396 --> 00:00:47,446
Scott: They're all kind of like more almost ten minutes away.

11
00:00:47,466 --> 00:00:48,570
Scott: It's kind of annoying.

12
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:53,370
Rym: Well, you realize it took us about 10 or 15 minutes to get to the Wegmans from our house in colony.

13
00:00:53,892 --> 00:00:55,318
Scott: Well, I took the secret back way.

14
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:56,221
Scott: It took a lot less time.

15
00:00:56,302 --> 00:00:57,507
Rym: It still took 10 minutes.

16
00:00:58,009 --> 00:01:03,206
Scott: Yeah Anyway, the other thing is a lot of the grocery stores don't have all the products.

17
00:01:03,286 --> 00:01:04,188
Scott: I want it's like.

18
00:01:04,971 --> 00:01:07,440
Rym: You have very specific picky taste in certain things.

19
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,410
Rym: you want this specific kind of bread and the specific kind of tomato sauce.

20
00:01:10,551 --> 00:01:11,274
Scott: What's wrong with that?

21
00:01:11,334 --> 00:01:12,982
Scott: I mean like you want specific.

22
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:14,710
Scott: I want coca-cola regular.

23
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,510
Scott: I mean, it's a specific product.

24
00:01:16,691 --> 00:01:22,570
Rym: You know and I wonder some of the things you're picky about if in a double-blind you could tell I could tell I don't know.

25
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:29,290
Scott: Anyway, it's like I want this brand of bread, and I want you know this branded tomato sauce and they don't have it there.

26
00:01:29,351 --> 00:01:30,110
Scott: It's kind of annoying.

27
00:01:30,552 --> 00:01:34,170
Scott: But we have to go there because there isn't a better grocery store.

28
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:38,770
Scott: Well there are but they're not close enough for it to be worth it to go to a different store.

29
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:41,690
Rym: But we'll skip all that because you guys don't care about our grocery problems.

30
00:01:42,192 --> 00:01:50,660
Rym: But we were in the grocery store today dealing with the fact that we played D&D over the weekend and the Visigoths Devoured every piece of food in our house.

31
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:53,210
Scott: Yes, so we were in this grocery store.

32
00:01:53,793 --> 00:01:56,390
Scott: It's a shop right and they slightly redeemed themselves.

33
00:01:57,432 --> 00:01:59,480
Scott: We're walking down the aisle, and what do I see?

34
00:01:59,601 --> 00:02:02,908
Scott: something that cannot possibly escape my eye Koalas March.

35
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:10,437
Rym: Now for those of you who are uninitiated into the cult of the koala in Japan There's a little candy.

36
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:11,844
Rym: It's not really a candy.

37
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:13,070
Scott: It's sort of a snack.

38
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:17,487
Rym: It's basically the to put it in no uncertain terms the

39
00:02:17,707 --> 00:02:18,250
Scott: cheapest

40
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:30,716
Rym: Cookie matter known to man puffs into a hollow thing and inside of that is the cheapest Chocolate the world has ever seen kind of puff Injected in there with the machine

41
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:34,468
Scott: and then they draw a picture of a koala on the outside of the cookie.

42
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,503
Rym: now There are many many different koalas that they can draw.

43
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:42,884
Rym: in fact at Katsu Kan We found the graph chart of every single koala that exists, and let's see

44
00:02:42,904 --> 00:02:52,547
Scott: we got the koala with the boombox the koala With the triangle the koala with the marmalade I guess the koala with the guitar the koala driving a car the koala playing the drum.

45
00:02:52,648 --> 00:02:53,290
Scott: you get the idea.

46
00:02:53,794 --> 00:02:55,830
Scott: There's a whole bunch of koalas, and they all do different things.

47
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:58,343
Rym: One is a Japanese construction koala.

48
00:02:58,604 --> 00:02:59,187
Scott: Oh, it's a good one.

49
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:02,399
Scott: well There are three different flavors of koala.

50
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,309
Rym: well know that there are two flavors ass not ass.

51
00:03:05,369 --> 00:03:11,419
Scott: yes Well, we've had the regular old koala Which is a vanilla cookie with chocolate inside.

52
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,563
Scott: that is a good koala.

53
00:03:12,603 --> 00:03:13,887
Scott: the not ass koala.

54
00:03:14,188 --> 00:03:16,054
Rym: now good It's for some.

55
00:03:16,094 --> 00:03:29,862
Rym: it's weird how the bad bad bad that all this is you know the cheapest components the absolute cheapest Manufacturing thing the stickiest stick and yet somehow it comes together into this delicious snack That has been a very big part of our lives from the moment.

56
00:03:29,882 --> 00:03:31,629
Rym: We first ate one when we were at RIT.

57
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:37,285
Scott: Yep, well, there's also these strawberry koala which is ass the strawberry queasy.

58
00:03:37,787 --> 00:03:38,990
Rym: I like the normal koala.

59
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,522
Rym: So when I knew that there was a strawberry koala we saw one.

60
00:03:41,562 --> 00:03:42,225
Rym: we bought a box.

61
00:03:42,245 --> 00:03:45,910
Rym: cuz I like strawberry How could they do this wrong?

62
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,716
Rym: I mean how could this possible?

63
00:03:48,118 --> 00:03:52,490
Rym: it tasted not so much like strawberry But like some sort of cleaning fluid.

64
00:03:52,996 --> 00:03:59,374
Scott: It's really bad anyway And it wasn't a bad batch either because I tried him again somewhere else with a different batch And it was still bad.

65
00:03:59,394 --> 00:04:00,378
Rym: it tastes like chemicals.

66
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:01,985
Scott: it tastes bad anyway.

67
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:05,329
Scott: at the store We basically bought every box.

68
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:10,589
Scott: They were selling them for a dollar per box and a box is pretty much as one serving of koalas.

69
00:04:11,131 --> 00:04:26,867
Scott: we bought every box of playing koalas they had for a dollar each and They they saw the third flavor was available in addition to the strawberry which we bought none of the white chocolate cream koala Which is a chocolate cookie with white chocolate inside.

70
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:30,130
Scott: now I have never had this koala and I have them right here.

71
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:36,046
Scott: We bought one package of white chocolate cream koala, and I'm gonna eat one right now now.

72
00:04:36,648 --> 00:04:37,390
Rym: I wouldn't buy it.

73
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:40,041
Rym: I mean we saw the normal koalas And it was pretty much.

74
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:43,649
Rym: Scott goes oh craps And he grabs as many as he can grab in one fistful.

75
00:04:44,113 --> 00:04:45,744
Rym: And I look and I see that there are three remaining.

76
00:04:45,784 --> 00:04:46,610
Rym: so I grabbed all of them.

77
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,250
Rym: We basically clean the place out of koalas immediately.

78
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:59,389
Rym: They're probably gonna be like huh we got these koala things and someone bought them all Because they must have gotten him right away, but I'm leery of this non normal koala.

79
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:05,850
Scott: Well judging from the smell and the look I'm going 50/50 on what it is gonna be good or bad.

80
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:07,820
Rym: So it's supposed to be white chocolate in there.

81
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,690
Rym: I wonder if it's actually white chocolate.

82
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,159
Scott: I'll read the ingredients after I eat it.

83
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:15,370
Scott: you ready all right It's okay.

84
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:25,059
Scott: I mean it's not poisonous, and it seems like it's got this hint that there's a good flavor somewhere But it never actually reaches that good flavor.

85
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,090
Scott: It's just the preamble like there's a good flavor coming.

86
00:05:28,351 --> 00:05:29,455
Scott: There's a good flavor coming.

87
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,726
Scott: It never comes and then there's kind of an aftertaste.

88
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:35,850
Scott: so Stick to the normal koalas people.

89
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:40,785
Rym: I guess I was correct in my assessment And I'm glad that I did not waste the $1 that you have now wasted.

90
00:05:40,806 --> 00:05:41,187
Scott: you want one?

91
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:42,636
Scott: no It's all right.

92
00:05:42,857 --> 00:05:44,970
Rym: I'll try it eventually, but I don't want one now all right.

93
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:51,090
Rym: So so Scott's gonna stop eating koala, so we don't hear smack smack smack gargle all the time.

94
00:05:51,831 --> 00:05:53,922
Scott: Yeah, only one just to see what it was like.

95
00:05:54,243 --> 00:05:58,767
Rym: granted while Scott was doing that I basically ate an entire little box of koalas in that span.

96
00:05:58,787 --> 00:06:01,177
Scott: well I think every box has hold on.

97
00:06:01,218 --> 00:06:06,205
Scott: it says on here every box of koalas is 14 cookies Which is two servings all right?

98
00:06:06,386 --> 00:06:06,769
Scott: That's cool?

99
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,021
Scott: Oh, let's see white chocolate cream is the number one ingredient huh?

100
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,309
Scott: It's partially hydrogenated palm and soy.

101
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:16,322
Scott: wow There's two and a half grams of trans fat in this koala.

102
00:06:16,784 --> 00:06:21,036
Rym: ah ah ah I just ate a bunch of trans fat.

103
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:21,798
Rym: That's not cool.

104
00:06:21,818 --> 00:06:24,807
Scott: There's five grams of trans fat in this entire koala package.

105
00:06:25,188 --> 00:06:25,610
Rym: That's a lot.

106
00:06:27,993 --> 00:06:30,370
Scott: Huh, maybe I have to go sparingly on the koala.

107
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,461
Rym: We finally learned about this trans fat business.

108
00:06:32,621 --> 00:06:34,310
Rym: and now that knowledge.

109
00:06:34,732 --> 00:06:35,656
Rym: It's like Cthulhu.

110
00:06:36,078 --> 00:06:44,570
Rym: there was something that we enjoyed and just now We came upon some dark hideous knowledge about that thing and now we look at it in a whole new light sigh.

111
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:54,619
Rym: Anyway, I don't have a segue here, but in the news you might have remembered a while ago that the guy who does riser FS his name is riser.

112
00:06:54,700 --> 00:07:03,781
Rym: if you couldn't get Hans riser well He was arrested for The possible murder of his wife his estranged wife.

113
00:07:04,162 --> 00:07:13,070
Scott: you could read all the facts of the case on the internets or on Wikipedia and I gotta say it looks like he probably did it.

114
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:15,625
Rym: I mean this can't say for sure, but this isn't news.

115
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:17,576
Rym: this happened a long time ago I believe we talked about it.

116
00:07:17,878 --> 00:07:19,730
Rym: the open-source community was kind of a buzz.

117
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:28,699
Rym: I mean It's kind of weird for me to see a high-profile tech guy who I the name I have only ever associated with tech when I hear riser.

118
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,705
Rym: I think riser FS the file system.

119
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:32,110
Rym: I use on my Gentoo box.

120
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:33,515
Scott: Yeah, I mean this guy.

121
00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:34,719
Scott: he's a programmer.

122
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,545
Scott: He made a really good file system.

123
00:07:36,565 --> 00:07:37,870
Scott: We did an episode in file systems.

124
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:41,555
Scott: you can go listen to that and It's it's really awesome.

125
00:07:41,615 --> 00:07:46,070
Scott: and the only thing we ever thought about this guy was he must be a smart guy who makes file systems.

126
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:50,350
Scott: That's not the kind of guy you think would murder his wife, and it just it's weird to hear him.

127
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,616
Rym: I mean when it first saw the news.

128
00:07:51,656 --> 00:07:54,710
Rym: I thought wow some guy named riser murdered his wife.

129
00:07:55,092 --> 00:07:56,460
Rym: That's pretty funny too bad.

130
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,808
Rym: It's not the guy who does my file system.

131
00:07:58,793 --> 00:08:05,825
Rym: Shit, it is the guy cuz if he actually goes to jail riser FS There's some dubious states as to what's gonna happen to it.

132
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:06,890
Scott: I mean it's kind of weird.

133
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:11,289
Scott: It's like you look at all the different groups of people you know in terms of what you know.

134
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:19,019
Scott: The general groups of people you know you know yeah, you know yeah, you know yeah, you know Yeah, you look at like athletes athletes.

135
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,026
Scott: some athletes are criminals some aren't.

136
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,978
Rym: oh jay simpson Oj politicians.

137
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:26,409
Scott: some politicians are criminals some are all of them.

138
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:27,972
Scott: Businessmen.

139
00:08:28,012 --> 00:08:29,797
Scott: some of them are criminals some aren't you know.

140
00:08:30,198 --> 00:08:34,570
Scott: it seems like the percentages are pretty average relative to the general population.

141
00:08:34,991 --> 00:08:39,789
Scott: When it comes to scientists and technology people you don't see too many criminals.

142
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:44,249
Rym: I believe you were discounting the very wide evil scientist demographic.

143
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:47,398
Scott: ah Yes, the evil scientist demographic.

144
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:56,054
Rym: I mean they're the ones who secretly made aids in the 1970s to kill minorities Or not.

145
00:08:56,576 --> 00:09:04,841
Rym: but anyway the actual news here is that he pleaded not guilty and All the people analyzing the case he fled not guilty.

146
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:05,744
Rym: regardless.

147
00:09:06,286 --> 00:09:13,510
Rym: the people around the case Aren't sure what to make of this because it's very odd apparently for a defendant to waive their right.

148
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:23,050
Rym: Well, basically you get a right to have a trial within 60 days in that state and yet He's waving his right or he's not waving his right, so he'll have the trial almost immediately.

149
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:26,610
Rym: So the prosecution is scrambling to get all their stuff together, huh?

150
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,773
Rym: Usually they want to.

151
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:32,449
Rym: they basically wait and let all the evidence be gathered and then have the trial and this guy's gun.

152
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,740
Rym: and yeah Let's just get this over with.

153
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:34,326
Rym: I didn't do it.

154
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:38,608
Scott: Maybe he there's some evidence that they haven't got and he doesn't think they'll get it in the 60 days.

155
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,046
Rym: Well, they haven't found his wife's body yet.

156
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,309
Scott: Ah It's a smart move being a murderer.

157
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,500
Scott: If he did it it's a smart move.

158
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,670
Rym: that's all I could say, you know what if he didn't do it?

159
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:57,735
Rym: It's a smart move to probably maybe I think all things told it probably makes it more likely that he'll get off Regardless of whether he did.

160
00:09:57,795 --> 00:09:58,398
Scott: Yeah, there's a reason.

161
00:09:58,418 --> 00:10:01,071
Scott: you have a right to a speedy trial, you know I would.

162
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:05,450
Scott: if I had needed a trial for me, I would definitely make it as speedy as possible.

163
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:13,537
Scott: I'm not gonna be waving any rights unless there was a reason to like I really didn't do it and They're gonna collect an evidence that proves I did.

164
00:10:13,698 --> 00:10:17,570
Rym: I can foresee a situation Scott where you would very readily waive your rights.

165
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:24,590
Rym: For example suppose that we amended the Constitution and you know how to write to sodomy, you know what I'm saying?

166
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,876
Rym: Are you saying that you wouldn't waive that?

167
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:28,137
Rym: right?

168
00:10:28,618 --> 00:10:32,349
Scott: the one rave the rights I've got already for real at ABC standing there.

169
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,662
Scott: All right, what's with you in the stupid ahead of easy?

170
00:10:36,144 --> 00:10:37,790
Scott: He has a funny head anyway.

171
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,377
Scott: So Apple that Apple TV thing.

172
00:10:41,398 --> 00:10:43,969
Scott: remember when they came out with the iPhone and talked about the Apple TV.

173
00:10:44,753 --> 00:10:46,219
Scott: You can get the Apple TV now.

174
00:10:46,742 --> 00:10:48,570
Rym: I'm not even sure what Apple TV is.

175
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,818
Scott: That's all I'm gonna tell you right now.

176
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:51,609
Scott: Apple TV is a little box.

177
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,496
Scott: It's like a Mac Mini only flat.

178
00:10:53,797 --> 00:10:59,202
Scott: and you plug it into your TV and you plug it into the electricity and the holes in The wall, you know the holes the holes.

179
00:10:59,262 --> 00:11:00,510
Rym: Yeah the holes Jerry, right?

180
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:04,730
Scott: And you also plug it into your audio with an optical cable or an RCA or whatever you've got.

181
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,935
Rym: Do I plug it into the Internet?

182
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:15,110
Scott: it plugs in to the Internet's with the wireless is But not really the Internet's so much as the other max nearby on the same network.

183
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:20,250
Scott: And what you do is you it has a hard drive and you send things to it.

184
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,600
Scott: You sync with it kind of like you sync with an iPod.

185
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,010
Scott: It's actually pretty slick the way you sync with it, right?

186
00:11:25,491 --> 00:11:27,138
Scott: So you go on iTunes.

187
00:11:27,158 --> 00:11:29,869
Scott: you buy some videos you sync with your Apple TV.

188
00:11:30,552 --> 00:11:33,023
Scott: You get some m4a and peg for videos.

189
00:11:33,043 --> 00:11:34,810
Scott: they got to be in like the right format.

190
00:11:35,173 --> 00:11:36,603
Rym: Oh, well that pretty much makes it useless.

191
00:11:36,865 --> 00:11:48,149
Scott: welcome to the Internet Yes And you sync it and you you put stuff on there and then using these slick interface of the Apple TV You can watch them in possibly HD on your TV.

192
00:11:48,832 --> 00:11:51,964
Scott: Which is the advantage over just plugging a computer into your TV?

193
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:59,230
Scott: because the compute most computers Can't output HD to your television without special stuff and the Apple TV does it with a slick interface?

194
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,148
Scott: That looks pretty nice, so that's it.

195
00:12:01,858 --> 00:12:02,590
Scott: That's pretty much.

196
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,195
Scott: I mean it has 802 11 ends.

197
00:12:04,235 --> 00:12:07,386
Scott: you can transfer stuff to it real fast if you have an 802.11 n thing.

198
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:14,648
Scott: I mean if you're having Apple TV you better be an Apple person with an HD TV and such and such.

199
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:32,066
Scott: However there's been a lot of hack soaring of it going on of course and people have gotten it to play xvids And they've gotten it to do all this stuff, but at the same time people are saying hey Here's how to use front row to turn your Mac into an Apple TV, so yeah, it's like.

200
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:33,591
Scott: I Don't know.

201
00:12:33,812 --> 00:12:41,710
Scott: I think that this device has uses, but the number of people who would actually Get a benefit from it is very small.

202
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:53,090
Scott: like you have to be a specific kind of person like you better be a Mac user who buys a lot of videos on iTunes and has an HD TV and your computer is nowhere near TV

203
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,718
Rym: And you have a bunch of Macs or at least one Mac

204
00:12:55,898 --> 00:13:02,369
Scott: and that yeah if your primary computers are all max then in That situation this would be a good thing for you to buy possibly.

205
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:04,130
Rym: well How much is this thing supposed to cost anyway?

206
00:13:04,812 --> 00:13:06,370
Scott: It's a good question and actually look that up.

207
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,630
Rym: Let's go to Apple because I'd wonder if it cost anywhere near the cost of a Mac mini.

208
00:13:11,193 --> 00:13:12,178
Scott: I just get a Mac mini.

209
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:13,726
Scott: well the Mac mini can't output HD.

210
00:13:13,746 --> 00:13:14,229
Scott: That's oh no.

211
00:13:15,572 --> 00:13:16,886
Scott: That's why I said if you have an HD TV.

212
00:13:17,551 --> 00:13:27,549
Rym: But even now currently while there is HD content on the internet the vast majority of the content that I guess Normal geeks watch on the oh is not HD.

213
00:13:27,951 --> 00:13:31,950
Rym: It is in fact YouTube quality or possibly anime fan sub quality.

214
00:13:32,592 --> 00:13:35,802
Scott: Well the Apple TV comes with the Apple TV.

215
00:13:36,323 --> 00:13:38,009
Scott: It has a 40 gigabyte hard drive.

216
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:41,226
Scott: That's it Yep, it doesn't need that much because it only stores what you're.

217
00:13:41,246 --> 00:13:50,769
Scott: you know you're gonna watch And you store most of this stuff on your Mac, and then you send it over watch it And then you don't you know sort of like your iPod It doesn't need a really big hard drive because you store the music on your PC.

218
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,115
Scott: Do you sync what you're gonna listen to?

219
00:13:52,658 --> 00:13:53,542
Scott: it's $300 which is like okay?

220
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,550
Scott: I guess I mean for an HD video card probably cost $300.

221
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:04,389
Rym: Yeah, that's about half the cost of the lowest end Mac mini, so I can see a market for it at least.

222
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:06,570
Scott: yeah It only because the price is low enough.

223
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:06,771
Scott: It's.

224
00:14:06,831 --> 00:14:15,565
Scott: that's the only reason anyone should even consider buying it and only if your HD Buying videos and iTunes and big-time Mac using other than that.

225
00:14:15,947 --> 00:14:19,009
Scott: I think this is a pretty very niche product.

226
00:14:26,685 --> 00:14:39,344
Rym: Things of the day now this thing of the day I got here this video is very important because if you're out there You need to be aware that the chicken police are ready to stop any fights You might get involved in.

227
00:14:39,785 --> 00:14:41,571
Scott: hey you there with that drumstick stop.

228
00:14:41,611 --> 00:14:44,259
Rym: You're under arrest particularly if you're a rabbit.

229
00:14:45,901 --> 00:14:52,614
Rym: Emily told us about this and she knew where it was on YouTube when she pointed us at it And she wouldn't say anything other than that.

230
00:14:52,755 --> 00:14:53,580
Rym: It's chicken police.

231
00:14:54,363 --> 00:14:58,000
Rym: So we watched it and sure enough it is in fact chicken police.

232
00:14:58,744 --> 00:15:01,240
Scott: It's a video of two rabbits and Emily is rabbit crazy.

233
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,599
Scott: So that's why she knows any if it's on the internet and this rabbit she knows about it.

234
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,374
Rym: Yeah, I mean when I'm bored at work or whenever I'm bored on the internet.

235
00:15:08,414 --> 00:15:09,840
Rym: I'll just search for videos of puppies.

236
00:15:10,165 --> 00:15:15,932
Rym: She's the same way except For videos of rabbits anyway, so this video has two rabbits, and they're fighting.

237
00:15:15,992 --> 00:15:19,280
Scott: they're fighting like our bitey bitey grabby grabby scratchy scratchy.

238
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:35,780
Rym: You know that jump around rabbit fight and suddenly these do hear this noise and these two chickens run over and each one of them takes one rabbit and basically acts exactly like a Bouncer at a club or a cop breaking up a fight and they separate the two rabbits pull them apart and just stand there staring at.

239
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:37,746
Scott: It's a funny animal video.

240
00:15:37,826 --> 00:15:41,040
Rym: one of the rabbits like moves to go back to fighting and the chicken goes nuts.

241
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,348
Rym: I like you stay right there.

242
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,280
Rym: Yeah, don't breathe don't move.

243
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:54,659
Scott: It's not quite as good as the video or the monkey bothering the Tigers But it's better than that video that recent video series of like the dog and the cat getting along now.

244
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,120
Rym: What makes this video is that after the chickens stand there for a while?

245
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,100
Rym: They stare down the rabbits and the rabbits seem to agree to stop fighting.

246
00:16:01,522 --> 00:16:04,980
Rym: The chickens decide that their job is done, and they both just walk away.

247
00:16:05,362 --> 00:16:09,282
Scott: Yeah, but like as they walk away right before they're like yeah, yeah That's right.

248
00:16:09,824 --> 00:16:10,928
Rym: like they they do that they.

249
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:14,060
Rym: they give this look like we'll be back if you two cause trouble.

250
00:16:15,064 --> 00:16:18,400
Scott: I really don't know what those animals are thinking, but it's it's pretty funny.

251
00:16:18,842 --> 00:16:21,760
Rym: I'll bet those chickens just didn't want those rabbits making noise.

252
00:16:24,143 --> 00:16:24,364
Scott: All right.

253
00:16:24,745 --> 00:16:26,271
Scott: so Rym I got a question for you.

254
00:16:26,492 --> 00:16:28,260
Scott: all right, how do you prove?

255
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,110
Scott: Photography to a blind man.

256
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:31,653
Rym: Well.

257
00:16:31,673 --> 00:16:32,960
Rym: That's an interesting question.

258
00:16:33,121 --> 00:16:38,137
Rym: I'll let you describe the answer because this is your thing of the day even though We already had this conversation a little while ago.

259
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:49,240
Scott: Yes Well, I read this on an awesome blog that I never read before called skeptico critical thinking for an irrational world And it's a short blog post, but it is very interesting.

260
00:16:49,880 --> 00:17:07,540
Scott: Basically this guy being a skeptic like us Was arguing with a psychic or a acclaimed psychic or someone who believed in psychics and that person said to this guy How do you prove photography to a blind man and obviously he was getting at was how do you prove?

261
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,252
Scott: Psychic miss to a non psychic person?

262
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:14,288
Scott: if you can't see the psychic miss How can I possibly prove to you that it's there?

263
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:25,579
Rym: now while this is a very very well You know I wouldn't call it a stupid analogy in retrospect because it's a very good analogy If you look at it from a smart point of view because it proves that this guy's wrong.

264
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:39,365
Rym: Yes, but at the same time I give this guy credit for whoever he stole this idea from because it's not of all the arguments That people make for psychic powers or for the evils of evidence-based science or whatever craziness They're talking about.

265
00:17:39,807 --> 00:17:43,426
Rym: that's probably the most well reasoned Argument I've ever heard.

266
00:17:43,587 --> 00:17:50,797
Rym: it'll take a smart smart person to come back against this argument Luckily at least to come back on the top of their feet out of the blue.

267
00:17:50,817 --> 00:17:54,770
Scott: yes Well this guy of course is a very smart person.

268
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,940
Scott: he says of course you can prove photography to a blind man.

269
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:58,843
Scott: It's very simple.

270
00:17:59,384 --> 00:18:08,160
Scott: you put him in a room you give him a camera a Polaroid probably and you say all right blind man Make sure that no one's in the room lock all the doors etcetera etcetera.

271
00:18:08,661 --> 00:18:09,966
Scott: You know doesn't have any windows.

272
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,400
Scott: then take a picture of yourself holding up some number of fingers.

273
00:18:13,962 --> 00:18:17,577
Scott: Then show that picture to people who can see that you've never met before.

274
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:25,959
Scott: ask them How many fingers you're holding up in that picture, and if they tell you how many fingers you're holding up then that probably worked.

275
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,658
Scott: and Photography is real you know.

276
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:32,392
Scott: Do it a whole bunch of times because they might have just guessed correctly.

277
00:18:32,753 --> 00:18:44,020
Scott: and if they keep saying the right number of fingers you can bet that that machine probably took a picture of you and Put it on to that piece of paper that you're showing to people and thus you would know the photography works.

278
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:47,670
Scott: Then he goes on to say some fun stuff making fun of psychics.

279
00:18:48,212 --> 00:19:03,600
Scott: if you did this a thousand times and the sighted person Got the correct number of fingers say 225 times out of a thousand Where pure chance would be 200 times where the blind man believed that this anomaly was proof of photography.

280
00:19:05,941 --> 00:19:07,105
Scott: Yes, just funny cuz.

281
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,977
Scott: psychics are like yeah, we get it right a better percentage of the time.

282
00:19:10,997 --> 00:19:14,589
Rym: yeah Yeah, it's perfect though.

283
00:19:14,629 --> 00:19:15,152
Rym: What can I say?

284
00:19:15,193 --> 00:19:15,937
Rym: that guy was smart?

285
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:16,420
Scott: Yeah?

286
00:19:17,242 --> 00:19:18,829
Rym: It's not that hard to own a psychic.

287
00:19:19,312 --> 00:19:20,940
Rym: It's not in a rational argument.

288
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:25,540
Scott: Yeah What if a scientific body spent 25?

289
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:35,619
Scott: Years researching whether sighted people could guess how many fingers blind people are holding up in front of a camera But concluded that there is ultimately very little if any data that supports the hypothesis that they can.

290
00:19:37,341 --> 00:19:40,513
Scott: What if a conjurer offered a million dollars for any sighted person?

291
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:43,815
Scott: you can successfully perform the five-finger test But no one was able to do it.

292
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:51,559
Scott: Yeah, wouldn't the blind man say to all this why can't you just tell me how many fingers I'm holding up?

293
00:19:53,942 --> 00:20:05,800
Rym: All right, yeah, so anyway over the weekend So we were playing D&D in two separate conversations Scott and I ended up explaining Encryption and bits of cryptography to numbers of our friends.

294
00:20:06,422 --> 00:20:12,820
Scott: Yeah, Pete explained to me because there was an article about those man sheep or huge on the chimera sheep thing.

295
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,787
Rym: Yeah, I almost used that as my news.

296
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:17,577
Scott: Yeah, but I I wanted him he's biology.

297
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:21,770
Scott: so I got him to Decrypt the story for me.

298
00:20:22,192 --> 00:20:29,898
Rym: That's a pretty heady claim that Pete is Biology that he encompasses all that biology is no, but he's biologist.

299
00:20:29,998 --> 00:20:32,547
Rym: in a way He is biologist.

300
00:20:33,451 --> 00:20:35,940
Rym: I think you're missing some indefinite articles there anyway.

301
00:20:37,581 --> 00:20:41,580
Scott: So and then I don't know how the conversation got to it, but it got to the encryption.

302
00:20:41,781 --> 00:20:48,260
Scott: So I explained to him how the private public key encryption works and I said hey We should do a show on that action.

303
00:20:48,441 --> 00:20:50,671
Rym: Yeah, I think the way this actually went down was.

304
00:20:50,691 --> 00:20:52,660
Rym: I overheard the tail end of your conversation.

305
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,267
Rym: I said did you just explain encryption to Pete?

306
00:20:55,548 --> 00:20:58,256
Rym: and you said yes, and he just explained sheep to me.

307
00:20:58,276 --> 00:20:59,660
Scott: That's what I said.

308
00:21:00,822 --> 00:21:07,800
Rym: So yeah, like all the recent shows we've done about technology We're gonna go about this in a very broad layman's terms.

309
00:21:08,102 --> 00:21:11,100
Rym: You don't need to know a lot of math or science or computing.

310
00:21:11,461 --> 00:21:15,034
Rym: We're just gonna go over the basics explain a lot of things very shallowly.

311
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:16,520
Rym: We're going for bread here not depth.

312
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:16,962
Scott: Yep.

313
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:17,647
Scott: All right.

314
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,560
Scott: So Rym what's encryption?

315
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:30,980
Rym: Well, you see back in Roman times say I'm Julius Caesar and I got my army and I'm gonna go invade Gaul and I'm gonna go blow up and destroy this one town in Gaul.

316
00:21:31,442 --> 00:21:34,680
Rym: But I need to get a bunch of army people here and make all my plans.

317
00:21:34,801 --> 00:21:36,459
Rym: So I got to send letters back to Rome.

318
00:21:37,142 --> 00:21:48,073
Rym: now what if while I send the letters back my dude gets ambushed and someone reads the letters that say OMG, I'm totally attacking the Gaulish capital lol zores.

319
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:50,700
Scott: Oh, what if the messenger dude is totally a spy?

320
00:21:51,261 --> 00:21:54,754
Rym: Yeah, or what if the messenger dude isn't a spy, but he's just dumb?

321
00:21:55,075 --> 00:22:03,360
Rym: and then he tells his wife at night Yeah, we're invading Gaul and his wife tells her friend and she tells her lover and then it gets back to the guy in Gaul There's like, oh really?

322
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:05,426
Scott: It's not so good.

323
00:22:05,727 --> 00:22:10,746
Rym: Well thus enter the Caesars cipher basically at its barest level.

324
00:22:11,027 --> 00:22:27,379
Rym: all encryption is is a way to either verify or obscure the contents of some sort form of information and you were transporting between two people or even just on yourself so that no one else can read it or Pretend it's theirs depending on how you go about it.

325
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,500
Scott: Yes, there are many times when you have some information and you don't want to share the information with the whole world.

326
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,878
Scott: You only want to share the information with one other person or a few other people.

327
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:38,800
Scott: now Of course You could just get in the same room as the person.

328
00:22:39,222 --> 00:22:50,579
Scott: Make sure no one else can hear you and talk or you can sit in a room Write on a piece of paper with no one else looking and then when you're done throw it in the fire And you know that that information will just be between you two people.

329
00:22:51,061 --> 00:22:58,520
Scott: However, sometimes you're far away or sometimes you don't want to do it in the same room or sometimes you're tired of writing.

330
00:22:59,142 --> 00:23:06,419
Scott: You got to be a hundred percent safe or close to a hundred percent safe and then you need encryptions now.

331
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,460
Rym: Classical old-style encryption worked on generally very simple principles.

332
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,413
Rym: These are probably the codes that you played with when you were a kid.

333
00:23:14,774 --> 00:23:21,500
Rym: you take your little note Like oh my god, Susie has cooties and then say you add one to every letter.

334
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:26,276
Rym: So a becomes B and X becomes Y and now you've got a bunch of guys.

335
00:23:26,316 --> 00:23:27,600
Scott: He becomes a yes.

336
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:35,145
Rym: And then now anyone who wants to read your message because it looks like gibberish has to know that the key is Subtract one from every letter.

337
00:23:35,427 --> 00:23:36,972
Rym: So the B is turned back into A's.

338
00:23:37,515 --> 00:23:38,920
Rym: you see you've got two kinds of text here.

339
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,800
Rym: Now you've got the plain text and the cipher text.

340
00:23:42,142 --> 00:23:45,419
Rym: These are two important terms that you really should understand before we can talk about this.

341
00:23:46,061 --> 00:23:56,900
Rym: Very simply the plain text is your message the thing you wrote the note the in the message Whatever it is The cipher text is what you get when you apply some form of encryption to the plain text.

342
00:23:57,442 --> 00:24:07,656
Rym: So you'll turn your plain text into a cipher text and then hopefully the person you give it to Has the key or the way to turn the cipher text black into back into plain text yet.

343
00:24:07,716 --> 00:24:08,980
Rym: No one else has this ability.

344
00:24:09,341 --> 00:24:17,380
Scott: Yes, well if you do something so simple as adding one to every letter while someone looking at it You know with their naked eyeball might go what the hell shit.

345
00:24:17,521 --> 00:24:18,691
Scott: I don't understand what this says.

346
00:24:18,772 --> 00:24:20,179
Scott: crap and You know.

347
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:28,767
Scott: But if they actually think about it for a minute or play with it, they can figure it out because it's not strong encryption It's weak ass encryption.

348
00:24:28,827 --> 00:24:29,711
Scott: Yeah for weekend.

349
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:31,920
Rym: I mean to give you a few ideas of how this could be broken.

350
00:24:32,301 --> 00:24:37,875
Rym: There aren't that many combinations of adding or subtracting a number from the alphabet across the front.

351
00:24:37,895 --> 00:24:40,741
Rym: In fact, there's really only 25.

352
00:24:40,741 --> 00:24:42,207
Scott: Yeah, it's not too hard now.

353
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:48,293
Rym: granted you could be clever and say oh well skip to risk it But it doesn't matter because you could still brute-force it pretty trivially.

354
00:24:48,474 --> 00:25:11,439
Rym: Yeah, just by trying all the combinations I mean think if you've got 25 possible combinations and you try them all 24 of them are gibberish and the 25th one is we attack at dawn The odds that the attack at dawn one is not right or the odds that there'll be more than one actual intelligible Series of text in there are pretty low

355
00:25:12,341 --> 00:25:13,769
Scott: Pretty much zero,

356
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:17,366
Rym: but there's a lot of other ways you could break this Statistical analysis.

357
00:25:17,406 --> 00:25:20,940
Rym: Let's say you know that the English language the letter E is the most used letter.

358
00:25:21,364 --> 00:25:23,944
Rym: So say someone sends a really long Encrypted thing like this.

359
00:25:24,325 --> 00:25:28,220
Rym: you look at it and you notice that the letter T occurs more often than any other letter.

360
00:25:28,801 --> 00:25:35,260
Rym: So then you figure out that T turns into an E. you figure out what transformation that was and now you're much closer to figure it.

361
00:25:36,462 --> 00:25:37,246
Scott: Yeah, you can go.

362
00:25:37,326 --> 00:25:40,440
Scott: you know those puzzle books they sell in the store that if I cross words.

363
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,160
Scott: But they also have logic puzzles and all kinds of other weird things.

364
00:25:43,601 --> 00:25:49,860
Scott: They have cryptograms in there and order of the stick actually did a cryptogram for a while with one of the characters.

365
00:25:50,021 --> 00:25:57,454
Scott: you couldn't see what she was saying without figuring it out and They're pretty easy to solve the hue a human sitting there for about 10 minutes.

366
00:25:57,494 --> 00:25:59,040
Scott: Who's not an idiot can figure it out.

367
00:25:59,482 --> 00:26:00,728
Scott: It's not very good at all.

368
00:26:01,069 --> 00:26:01,270
Rym: Yep.

369
00:26:01,592 --> 00:26:03,219
Rym: So then things kind of moved along to.

370
00:26:04,002 --> 00:26:21,360
Rym: Well, obviously aside from that you could also do substitutions where instead of just having you know Plus one minus one an algorithm you have a code table like a is actually B C is actually F and you make this whole list where you correspond each letter to some other letter where there's no numerical system to it.

371
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,147
Rym: There's just a lookup table for it.

372
00:26:23,589 --> 00:26:23,749
Scott: Yep.

373
00:26:24,051 --> 00:26:25,717
Rym: That's obviously just as easily broken.

374
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:28,450
Scott: now There are other types of things you can use.

375
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,320
Scott: we've been talking about here is ciphers.

376
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:32,678
Scott: You can also use a code now in.

377
00:26:33,741 --> 00:26:37,152
Scott: You know normal people talk just layman's terms in the everyday.

378
00:26:37,172 --> 00:26:39,420
Scott: a code in a cipher are the same damn thing.

379
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,973
Rym: Yeah code cipher encryption secret code, whatever.

380
00:26:42,013 --> 00:26:43,280
Rym: They're all just the same.

381
00:26:43,481 --> 00:26:47,518
Scott: However, a cipher and a code technically speaking are very different things.

382
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,820
Rym: now There's a lot of ways we could explain it and a lot of really geeky analogies.

383
00:26:50,840 --> 00:27:00,175
Rym: Yes, but a code is like Rym the hawk flies at midnight Echo echo dolphin the base has landed on the moon.

384
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:01,640
Rym: I'm watching anime.

385
00:27:02,144 --> 00:27:03,233
Rym: bravo Victor.

386
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:04,804
Rym: and And such.

387
00:27:05,247 --> 00:27:06,493
Scott: yes see in the code.

388
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:12,380
Scott: You haven't really Encrypted like the specific bits of the information, you know separately.

389
00:27:12,862 --> 00:27:17,120
Scott: You've just changed the meaning of what you're saying into something else.

390
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,912
Scott: So this means that a whole block of stuff means a different block of stuff.

391
00:27:21,952 --> 00:27:26,939
Scott: So, you know flies at midnight means Attack at noon.

392
00:27:28,724 --> 00:27:30,980
Rym: These sorts of codes unlike ciphers.

393
00:27:31,382 --> 00:27:35,400
Rym: Well not like ciphers, but in terms of how they can be broken are broken to much the same manner.

394
00:27:35,684 --> 00:27:36,960
Rym: You can look at statistical things.

395
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:41,620
Rym: You might correlate me saying the cock vote launches at midnight.

396
00:27:42,062 --> 00:27:47,998
Rym: Suppose I say that every time we do a show you could figure out The cock vote at midnight means they put a show up.

397
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,737
Rym: Yep, now a more secure one would be a one-time use code like one if I land two.

398
00:27:54,797 --> 00:27:59,480
Rym: if by sea sure You could figure out what it meant post-hoc after the fact.

399
00:27:59,822 --> 00:28:03,340
Rym: But when it was used it was used and no one could figure it out right away.

400
00:28:03,561 --> 00:28:06,211
Scott: As long as you don't use it again, you're okay.

401
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:09,222
Rym: Now remember that that concept is very critical later Mm-hmm.

402
00:28:09,783 --> 00:28:13,495
Rym: now beyond all that they kind of moved on to more technological solutions.

403
00:28:13,555 --> 00:28:16,379
Rym: where I remember in World War two You might have heard about enigma.

404
00:28:16,942 --> 00:28:20,558
Rym: But there was this whole idea where you could encrypt instead of having one way.

405
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,820
Rym: You know add four to every letter subtract three from every letter switch them around in a spent way.

406
00:28:26,362 --> 00:28:31,520
Rym: What if the number of letters you went in any given direction changed with every letter?

407
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,787
Rym: So the first letter you add three to it.

408
00:28:34,008 --> 00:28:39,359
Rym: the second letter you subtract three the third letter you add for the second letter you Add five the fourth letter you don't change.

409
00:28:39,861 --> 00:28:49,679
Scott: Now that's you know, it's not impossible to figure that out because what we did but it is pretty damn hard Yep, and basically the more complicated you make it the harder it is.

410
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:58,946
Rym: Of course It was mostly hard because we didn't have computers back then and in fact some of the first computers in the world were designed Specifically to break this kind of encryption.

411
00:28:59,387 --> 00:29:03,580
Scott: In fact the things that made this encryption like people didn't do this encryption by hand.

412
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:10,986
Scott: They had these mechanical enigma machines that were like typewriters and you would type and the encrypted text We come out in on the paper.

413
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:11,428
Rym: Yep.

414
00:29:11,468 --> 00:29:14,420
Rym: Now basically this was just a security through obscurity.

415
00:29:14,942 --> 00:29:15,183
Rym: The what.

416
00:29:15,223 --> 00:29:17,150
Rym: it doesn't matter what the machine actually was.

417
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:21,424
Rym: to someone like me or like the Allies in World War two We're trying to break this code.

418
00:29:21,945 --> 00:29:26,900
Rym: It didn't matter if it was an enigma machine or a bunch of slaves pulling cards through loops.

419
00:29:27,605 --> 00:29:29,800
Rym: I'm not sure what I meant by cards through transistors.

420
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,309
Rym: Yes Because it all comes down to.

421
00:29:32,349 --> 00:29:40,549
Rym: you have a black box which in Technically or geek speak is a device where you don't know what's in it But you know the inputs and you know the outputs.

422
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:56,420
Rym: or maybe you only know the outputs, but the fact remains It's a black box and while you don't know how it works inside There are ways to figure out what the end result of the transformations inside it are and you can come up with a working model Where it might not be the same thing.

423
00:29:56,641 --> 00:29:59,373
Rym: I might decode it and make this totally different machine.

424
00:29:59,775 --> 00:30:06,780
Rym: that if the end Works in the same way and that yeah, I put the same input into my machine or the enigma the same output comes out.

425
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:15,179
Scott: Yeah, if you have a let's say you have a box and it has three buttons and three light bulbs you push You know and you can push any combination of buttons and see what light bulbs turn on.

426
00:30:15,802 --> 00:30:23,154
Scott: Now, of course if you open up the box and you see the wiring inside You know exactly what light bulbs are gonna light up when you push which buttons.

427
00:30:23,194 --> 00:30:24,580
Scott: it's obvious you see it right there.

428
00:30:25,082 --> 00:30:32,039
Scott: But if the box is locked and there's no way to see what's inside You just keep pushing buttons and see what lights light up and so you figure the whole thing out.

429
00:30:33,002 --> 00:30:44,460
Rym: Now everything we've talked about thus far old style encryption is mostly useless and is not used by anyone serious anymore because there are so many ways to break it that it's just it doesn't matter.

430
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,520
Rym: you Can increase the complexity to increase the amount of time it takes to break it, but it's generally a linear relationship.

431
00:30:50,922 --> 00:30:58,072
Rym: You can't make it so complex that a computer couldn't figure it out without making the code Complex that it would take longer for you to encode it.

432
00:30:58,354 --> 00:30:59,740
Rym: then it would be for you to use it.

433
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,260
Scott: Yeah, a lot of the problems is that you know people have computers.

434
00:31:03,601 --> 00:31:16,500
Scott: So if a code is simple enough that someone can figure it out, you know It's got to be really complex to make it Impossible for a computer to figure it out or at least impossible for a computer to figure it out in a reasonable amount of time.

435
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:23,944
Scott: I mean if a computer could figure it out in say 500 years, it's effectively Impossible to figure it out.

436
00:31:23,984 --> 00:31:28,760
Scott: It doesn't really matter even that it's technically feasible for them to get the right answer.

437
00:31:29,101 --> 00:31:39,720
Rym: yeah, the thing is though not to get into the details, but information theory and Modern analysis of these kinds of codes basically proves that it is impossible to make these codes secure.

438
00:31:39,841 --> 00:31:42,660
Rym: There is no amount of complexity that will make them usefully secure.

439
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:54,199
Rym: Yep now Scott is gonna talk a bit about the modern way of Encrypting things which to boil it down very very broadly involves math.

440
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:56,399
Scott: Yes, there is much math.

441
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,185
Scott: That is the things computers do is?

442
00:31:58,225 --> 00:32:02,840
Scott: they do math and this you need to use this math to encrypt things in a good way.

443
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:07,892
Scott: Yes Well, the first thing you can do is you can use a symmetric key.

444
00:32:08,454 --> 00:32:10,660
Scott: now a symmetric key isn't that popular?

445
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,843
Scott: But it does have its uses.

446
00:32:12,224 --> 00:32:15,374
Scott: a symmetric key basically is where I have a key.

447
00:32:15,695 --> 00:32:17,140
Scott: the key is some number.

448
00:32:17,461 --> 00:32:27,538
Scott: it's a number and there's some algorithm which takes that number and Applies it to some data and turns that data into the ciphertext, which is all encrypted.

449
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,080
Rym: now.

450
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,353
Rym: See we've been talking about encrypting letters.

451
00:32:30,776 --> 00:32:36,240
Rym: in modern computers We basically just increase encrypt bit streams or bytes or ones and zeros, but the principles are the same.

452
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,613
Scott: Yeah, we turn one set of we take a number which is a set of which is a big.

453
00:32:39,814 --> 00:32:41,340
Scott: what stream of ones and zeros?

454
00:32:41,701 --> 00:32:43,348
Scott: We take enough a bunch of stuff.

455
00:32:43,368 --> 00:32:46,300
Scott: That's a bunch of ones and zeros apply one to the other.

456
00:32:46,561 --> 00:32:51,100
Scott: We get another set of ones and zeros and then we can reverse it using the same key.

457
00:32:51,741 --> 00:32:59,692
Scott: So one key does the encrypting and the decrypting and all I have to do is if it's a complicated enough key That it can encrypt.

458
00:32:59,793 --> 00:33:12,635
Scott: really well I give that key to anyone else who I want to be able to encrypt and decrypt data with and now anyone who doesn't have that key Can encrypt and decrypt the text and no one else can really understand what we're doing.

459
00:33:12,695 --> 00:33:14,060
Scott: as long as it's complicated enough.

460
00:33:14,482 --> 00:33:16,993
Scott: You know, it's like a hundred and twenty eight bit symmetric key.

461
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:20,668
Scott: It's gonna take people Basically forever before it.

462
00:33:20,688 --> 00:33:22,900
Scott: they'll be dead by the time they figure out what we said.

463
00:33:23,343 --> 00:33:25,639
Scott: I'll be dead by the time they figure out what we said.

464
00:33:25,941 --> 00:33:46,510
Rym: Yep, and with these sorts of keys unlike the other ones where oh if you make it more complex It's still not much more difficult to break with this sort of encryption as you add bits and you make it more complex The relationship between how complex you make it and how long it will take even in optimal cases to brute-force break it Increases at such a rate that it's effectively unbreakable.

465
00:33:46,811 --> 00:33:55,466
Scott: Yeah, even if you had supercomputers working day and night I mean sure you might be able to break one person when you were an old man Maybe if you got lucky.

466
00:33:56,008 --> 00:34:03,699
Scott: guess what if there are hundreds of thousands of people using this encryption Give up now, you know can't make computers fast enough now.

467
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:05,439
Rym: granted Here's a nice interesting bit.

468
00:34:05,801 --> 00:34:17,929
Rym: The reason these are so secure has to do with the fact that the math behind them and the math they use to set this Up is the kind of math that is very Expensive for computers to deal with.

469
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,219
Rym: it's not math that can be on quickly or simply.

470
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,891
Scott: Yeah, like a lot of it involves using very large prime numbers.

471
00:34:23,951 --> 00:34:26,699
Scott: Well, it's easy to just pick a large prime number.

472
00:34:27,101 --> 00:34:27,684
Scott: Oh, there's one.

473
00:34:28,206 --> 00:34:31,560
Scott: but imagine if you had to figure out big prime numbers.

474
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,110
Scott: It could be any giant prime number huge.

475
00:34:34,632 --> 00:34:36,100
Scott: You have to go through all of them.

476
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:40,038
Scott: It's hard enough for a computer to figure out the next prime number.

477
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,867
Scott: now You're basically guessing and they're real big.

478
00:34:42,928 --> 00:34:45,596
Scott: So there's like millions upon millions of choices.

479
00:34:45,636 --> 00:34:46,779
Scott: It's like oh fuck me.

480
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,239
Scott: Yeah, it's it really sucks.

481
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:59,940
Rym: It basically comes down to the fact that as far as we've been able to figure out by information theory physics Computing and the world there is no easy way to do the math that we're looking at here.

482
00:35:00,241 --> 00:35:04,493
Rym: So even if computers get faster and faster even computers get a thousand times faster.

483
00:35:04,914 --> 00:35:07,040
Rym: It's still very difficult to break these codes.

484
00:35:07,241 --> 00:35:19,520
Rym: Yep, all right now the interesting part here just a real quick Is that it's possible because there were old kinds of codes that people thought were very secure and then new kinds of math were figured Out that basically made them useless.

485
00:35:20,482 --> 00:35:27,300
Rym: It is possible that someone could figure out a way to use modern computers to break these sorts of problems quicker.

486
00:35:27,421 --> 00:35:28,668
Rym: However, this is very unlikely.

487
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,500
Scott: Yeah, you'd have to invent a new math.

488
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:36,760
Scott: Basically, the interesting thing assumes there is a new math and I think we figured out most of the math in theory.

489
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:40,833
Rym: Quantum computers could do this sort of thing trivially.

490
00:35:40,893 --> 00:35:42,480
Rym: This has not been shown in practice yet.

491
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:53,500
Rym: But there's a lot of theory that if you made a certain kind of quantum computer it could do these factorizations and these maths Effectively immediately and break this sort of code so trivially that the code effectively doesn't exist.

492
00:35:53,580 --> 00:36:00,570
Rym: But that is beyond anything that is going to happen in the next many years And that's why people keep talking about quantum encryption.

493
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:08,480
Scott: because theoretically a quantum encryption You know in the same kind of theory that says a quantum computer can break modern encryption immediately.

494
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:16,947
Scott: the same kind of theories say that if you used a quantum computer to encrypt something it would be Absolutely a hundred percent unbreakable ever.

495
00:36:17,348 --> 00:36:17,548
Rym: Yes.

496
00:36:17,629 --> 00:36:18,591
Rym: None of this has been proven.

497
00:36:18,631 --> 00:36:19,754
Rym: It's also very complex.

498
00:36:20,195 --> 00:36:21,860
Scott: I barely don't understand it at all.

499
00:36:22,101 --> 00:36:22,844
Rym: I understand it.

500
00:36:23,045 --> 00:36:23,989
Rym: on about the level.

501
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:24,753
Rym: I just explained.

502
00:36:24,773 --> 00:36:26,119
Scott: Yeah, I understand what I just said.

503
00:36:27,361 --> 00:36:27,602
Scott: All right.

504
00:36:27,642 --> 00:36:29,730
Scott: Now I just talked about a symmetric key.

505
00:36:29,951 --> 00:36:30,613
Scott: I have a key.

506
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:34,627
Scott: the key is used to encrypt and decrypt And I give the key to anyone else.

507
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:37,280
Scott: I want to be able to read or write messages in the code.

508
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:42,160
Rym: Now pros of this message very this idea very simple very easy to do very secure.

509
00:36:42,663 --> 00:36:45,040
Scott: The problem is I have to give the key to people.

510
00:36:45,261 --> 00:36:48,160
Scott: I mean, you know if I write the key, how am I gonna give this key to Rym?

511
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,740
Scott: All right, maybe I'll write it down in a piece of paper and give it to him.

512
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,108
Rym: All right That's a pain in the ass cuz.

513
00:36:52,148 --> 00:36:55,789
Rym: now you have to physically meet me Which would give up all sorts of information.

514
00:36:55,809 --> 00:37:01,539
Rym: if people are actually trying to read like learn stuff about us There's the chance that I might fuck it up when I'm trying to type it back in.

515
00:37:02,102 --> 00:37:05,400
Scott: Yep, maybe I'll give it to him and a file on a thumb drive.

516
00:37:05,561 --> 00:37:07,207
Scott: Well, what if someone gets the thumb drive?

517
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:10,580
Rym: or what if someone has your computer while you're giving it to me?

518
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,572
Rym: And looks in your RAM or looks in something and finds it.

519
00:37:13,853 --> 00:37:15,340
Scott: Yeah, it's really troublesome.

520
00:37:15,762 --> 00:37:19,340
Scott: What if you know Rym is on the other side of the world and I want to send him a secret message.

521
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:30,521
Scott: Well, if I send him the key over the internet someone might see it while it's on its way over to Rym And if they see that then it doesn't matter how big that key was Cuz.

522
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:35,820
Scott: now all the encrypted stuff I'm gonna send next is gonna be able to be decrypted by them easily.

523
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,972
Rym: Now the awesome answer to that is well, why don't you just encrypt the key?

524
00:37:39,454 --> 00:37:41,000
Rym: And I think you see why that doesn't work.

525
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,769
Scott: They'll just get the key to the key and such.

526
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:47,080
Scott: It doesn't you know, it doesn't make it more secure and gifting it more times.

527
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:56,171
Rym: Yes, in fact just remember that in general with modern encryption if you have encrypted something if you encrypt it again It does not increase the difficulty of decrypting it.

528
00:37:56,212 --> 00:38:01,420
Scott: for reasons of math, and I'm not gonna bother explaining It's like a zipping a zip file doesn't make it any smaller.

529
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,350
Rym: In fact, it can make it bigger or less secure in some situations.

530
00:38:04,471 --> 00:38:04,652
Scott: Yes.

531
00:38:05,173 --> 00:38:06,960
Scott: Now, what do we do about this problem?

532
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,185
Scott: There is a solution.

533
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:11,573
Rym: It's a very widely used solution.

534
00:38:11,673 --> 00:38:13,238
Scott: In fact, you probably use it all the time.

535
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:18,374
Scott: It is called Asymmetric key encryption instead of having one key.

536
00:38:18,956 --> 00:38:20,019
Scott: We have two keys.

537
00:38:20,822 --> 00:38:25,855
Scott: One key is the public key and one key is the private key.

538
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:30,047
Scott: now as the names imply The public key is public.

539
00:38:30,188 --> 00:38:31,834
Scott: anyone in the world can look at this key.

540
00:38:31,894 --> 00:38:34,422
Scott: have the key all you want do whatever you want I don't give a shit.

541
00:38:34,784 --> 00:38:35,807
Scott: and the private key?

542
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:39,300
Scott: you keep that close to your chest and you don't let anyone see it ever.

543
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,880
Scott: Now how do you is this work with the two keys?

544
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,914
Scott: I mean if one person can see this key that is all around the whole world.

545
00:38:47,295 --> 00:38:48,580
Scott: doesn't that kind of ruin everything?

546
00:38:48,922 --> 00:39:04,720
Rym: No, the answer in a word Well not in a word but in a short explanation is irreversible math where you have some sort of math thing Whereby you can take one set of data and create or derive another set of data But yet you can't use the end result and go back.

547
00:39:04,981 --> 00:39:08,313
Rym: You can't look at the data I've made and figure out the data.

548
00:39:08,374 --> 00:39:09,518
Rym: It came from right?

549
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:10,020
Scott: Look at this.

550
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,719
Scott: Let's say you know modulus, you know remainder right three divided by two.

551
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:15,204
Scott: The remainder is one.

552
00:39:15,305 --> 00:39:17,593
Scott: the modulus of three mod two is one.

553
00:39:17,613 --> 00:39:23,456
Scott: Yes, if I give you the number one You have no idea if I did three mod two a hundred mod.

554
00:39:23,497 --> 00:39:25,645
Scott: Ninety-nine Ninety-nine mod.

555
00:39:25,685 --> 00:39:27,673
Scott: Eighty-eight two mod one.

556
00:39:27,693 --> 00:39:31,458
Scott: I guess not two mod one, but I Got one wrong.

557
00:39:31,982 --> 00:39:36,840
Scott: But you see the point is that you and you do some math on a number and the resulting number.

558
00:39:37,143 --> 00:39:38,680
Scott: There's no way to go backwards.

559
00:39:39,061 --> 00:39:40,346
Scott: There's only one direction.

560
00:39:40,406 --> 00:39:44,180
Scott: the numbers go in one way and you can never go back to get the original number again.

561
00:39:44,601 --> 00:39:53,840
Rym: So on one hand you're now free to give this new number to anyone you want and at the end at the other hand This number is still derived from your more important private number.

562
00:39:54,181 --> 00:39:58,937
Scott: Yes, if they had the private number, which is a very large complicated prime number, you'd be fucked.

563
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:04,295
Scott: instead They have this other number and that number is related to your number.

564
00:40:04,716 --> 00:40:05,680
Scott: So the keys match.

565
00:40:06,121 --> 00:40:10,800
Scott: However, there is no way for them to figure out your private number from the public number now.

566
00:40:11,301 --> 00:40:12,725
Scott: Here's why this is useful.

567
00:40:13,206 --> 00:40:19,165
Scott: the public number the number that everyone in the world knows can only be used to Encrypt.

568
00:40:19,788 --> 00:40:25,039
Scott: so if Rym wants to send me a message Encrypted I have a private key in a public key.

569
00:40:25,642 --> 00:40:35,560
Rym: I give Rym my public key as because anyone in the world can see that number You can email it to me in plain text Blind carbon copying the world and shouting it out as he runs down the street.

570
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,323
Rym: It doesn't matter.

571
00:40:36,484 --> 00:40:36,906
Scott: all they.

572
00:40:37,066 --> 00:40:40,280
Scott: all that allows people to do is to send me encrypted messages.

573
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,946
Scott: It has no other useful function.

574
00:40:42,347 --> 00:40:45,277
Scott: So Rym uses that public key and encrypts a message.

575
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,527
Scott: now Rym can't even decrypt that message.

576
00:40:48,868 --> 00:40:59,058
Scott: He has to give it to me and I have the private key Which is the only way in the world without lots and lots of computers in a hundred years to decrypt that message.

577
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:06,643
Scott: So Obviously the only problem with this public private key business is of course if the math is wrong someone's gonna bust you open.

578
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:11,155
Scott: but the math has been tested quite a bit and It's pretty hard to break.

579
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:14,650
Rym: now The only real drawback of the asymmetric keys is that math wise.

580
00:41:14,711 --> 00:41:24,342
Rym: according to professors who know a lot more about math than we do They're not as secure per bit or per length of key as symmetric ciphers due to math We don't understand.

581
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:30,440
Rym: it basically comes down to a smaller symmetric key is as secure as a larger asymmetric key.

582
00:41:30,901 --> 00:41:41,687
Scott: Yes, that's why when you do like an SSL you'll do like 128 bit SSL encryption But when you do like a PGP RSA public private key thing you'll do like a 4096 bit encryption.

583
00:41:43,314 --> 00:41:48,194
Rym: Yep The thing is computers are fast enough to where you don't lose much by using larger keys.

584
00:41:48,235 --> 00:41:50,321
Rym: the performance differences in most cases are Negligible.

585
00:41:50,341 --> 00:42:00,600
Scott: Yes, if you have the keys and you're just encrypting and decrypting things and not trying to break someone else's code It might take a minute, but it really doesn't take long at all.

586
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:07,320
Scott: Especially if you have a modern computer like if you have a core duo It's gonna be like boot encrypted boot decrypted no problems.

587
00:42:07,447 --> 00:42:14,160
Rym: Yeah It's also the fact that it comes down to basically asymmetric keys are so much more useful than any other kind of encryption out there.

588
00:42:14,244 --> 00:42:21,605
Rym: Yes That there's no reason to unless you're a crazy paranoid nut to try to use anything else or to use some sort of Gigantic monster key.

589
00:42:21,745 --> 00:42:22,006
Scott: Yes.

590
00:42:22,407 --> 00:42:32,120
Scott: Now the problem of course with this public private key business is it only goes one way I have the private key which can decrypt and the whole world has the public key which can encrypt.

591
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:37,320
Rym: So if you want to talk to people you have to have the public key of every person you want to talk to right?

592
00:42:37,502 --> 00:42:38,860
Scott: So it got to go both ways.

593
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:46,460
Scott: So with if I have a private key and everyone else is public key everyone can send me messages But I can't send anyone else any messages.

594
00:42:47,042 --> 00:42:51,317
Scott: So other people have to have their own private keys and they have to give me their public keys.

595
00:42:51,638 --> 00:42:52,220
Scott: and we're actually.

596
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:56,619
Scott: When I send stuff to Rym it's encrypted differently than when he sends stuff to me.

597
00:42:57,341 --> 00:43:03,163
Scott: It's encrypted for his public and private key pair when I send it to him and for my public and private key pair when he Sends to me.

598
00:43:03,646 --> 00:43:03,806
Rym: Yep.

599
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:08,660
Rym: Now we've talked a lot about all these methods of encryption And we always point out that they can all be broken.

600
00:43:09,162 --> 00:43:14,060
Rym: So I'm sure the question that is not only some of your minds is well, why is that even a distinction?

601
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,713
Rym: I mean, is it possible to make an unbreakable encryption?

602
00:43:16,773 --> 00:43:20,914
Rym: and the answer is not only yes But yes that has been known for a very very long time.

603
00:43:21,357 --> 00:43:23,265
Scott: It's actually Stupidly easy.

604
00:43:23,305 --> 00:43:25,279
Scott: I can do it with a pen and a paper right now.

605
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:35,465
Rym: Yes, it turns out that the most secure and when I say most secure, I mean has been proven mathematically in information theory that it is 100% secure.

606
00:43:35,826 --> 00:43:37,170
Rym: as long as you do it, right?

607
00:43:37,291 --> 00:43:39,940
Scott: Yeah a quantum computer might not even be able to bust it open.

608
00:43:40,141 --> 00:43:45,180
Rym: Yes, it's called a one-time pad and we're gonna talk about it mostly because it's very interesting.

609
00:43:45,562 --> 00:43:49,999
Scott: Now what you do with a one-time pad is you take a pad and you just write down numbers on it.

610
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,960
Rym: That probably wouldn't work, you know, you need random numbers.

611
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:59,075
Rym: Basically, all you need to use a one-time pad is some source of randomness.

612
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:00,700
Rym: It has to be actual randomness.

613
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:01,999
Rym: So rolling dice is fine.

614
00:44:02,422 --> 00:44:05,000
Rym: Flipping a deck of cards and drawing random cards is fine.

615
00:44:05,421 --> 00:44:07,707
Rym: Flipping bingo chips and pulling them out is fine.

616
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:13,119
Rym: any way of getting actual random numbers flipping a coin a million times work Just as well.

617
00:44:13,247 --> 00:44:18,676
Scott: Yep If they're not actually random then there will in the long run be some sort of pattern.

618
00:44:19,097 --> 00:44:24,030
Scott: and if there's some sort of pattern Then someone can find that pattern eventually and figure it out.

619
00:44:24,211 --> 00:44:27,942
Rym: now to you have to generate a sheet or something Some.

620
00:44:27,962 --> 00:44:31,700
Rym: I mean it could be a CD a flash drive anything that has the stream of random data.

621
00:44:31,963 --> 00:44:40,089
Rym: You have to have two copies of it One that you keep and one that you give to the person you're going to be exchanging data with and you can't let anyone Else get this or else.

622
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:40,755
Scott: It's game over.

623
00:44:40,997 --> 00:44:43,325
Rym: Yes Now the final bits are that one.

624
00:44:43,566 --> 00:44:56,439
Rym: you cannot let anyone know your plain text either because then they could theoretically Retroactively mess with you which however while that is a concern if you follow the final bit of information That's irrelevant.

625
00:44:56,901 --> 00:45:09,739
Rym: The final bit of information is if you ever use any part of your random data any segment of it any page any whatever You can never ever ever ever use that again ever and furthermore you must destroy it.

626
00:45:10,161 --> 00:45:14,659
Scott: Yep, so you've got this pad of pages and each page is a bunch of random data on it.

627
00:45:14,981 --> 00:45:16,840
Scott: Now you've got a message in English.

628
00:45:17,261 --> 00:45:26,787
Scott: You take the first letter of that message and you combine it somehow with the first number on the paper to create the new letter or the encrypted letter.

629
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,976
Rym: in the old days they do a mod 26 of.

630
00:45:30,641 --> 00:45:34,260
Rym: They make sure the numbers were mod 26, and then they just add them to the letter.

631
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:41,377
Scott: yep, then you take the second letter and you take the second number from the piece of paper and You put down the encrypted letter.

632
00:45:41,397 --> 00:45:45,696
Rym: now You might say this sounds a lot like those old classical ciphers that Rimm and Scott said were broken.

633
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:54,447
Rym: the difference is There is no deterministic way to find any relation between what was done to one letter And what was done to any other letter?

634
00:45:54,548 --> 00:45:57,160
Scott: you're not doing the same thing to every single letter.

635
00:45:57,321 --> 00:46:01,477
Scott: You're doing a different thing to each and every letter and who knows what that thing is?

636
00:46:01,879 --> 00:46:04,892
Scott: you know I mean someone looks at it there might be mostly s's.

637
00:46:05,233 --> 00:46:10,218
Scott: well if they turn those all into ease They're not right because you did something different to each and every letter.

638
00:46:10,238 --> 00:46:17,598
Rym: yep There is no possible statistical analysis because there is no way to Differentiate the data from the random noise that it was added to.

639
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,713
Rym: Furthermore say you brute-force it because it's only letters.

640
00:46:21,954 --> 00:46:23,840
Rym: you could make every possible combination.

641
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:29,859
Rym: So like we said before wouldn't one of the combinations be we attack at dawn and all the others are gibberish?

642
00:46:30,361 --> 00:46:35,420
Rym: No, because the possible combinations include every single possible combination of letters.

643
00:46:35,721 --> 00:46:41,018
Rym: So we attack at dawn we attack at dusk we attack at pens Rym.

644
00:46:41,038 --> 00:46:42,483
Scott: doesn't know what the hell He's talking about.

645
00:46:42,663 --> 00:46:45,874
Rym: blibbity blobbity blibbity blah a string of cockboats.

646
00:46:46,155 --> 00:46:47,720
Rym: They're all equally possible.

647
00:46:48,101 --> 00:46:56,100
Rym: So there is no way on earth at all with any form of anything To decrypt a one-time pad if it was made proper.

648
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:03,572
Scott: Yep Use every number on the pad once and only once and then as soon as you finish a page in the pad you tear it Off and you disintegrate it.

649
00:47:03,977 --> 00:47:11,947
Scott: now The only way to figure out what the message was is the other person with the same exact pad Gets the message and he has the numbers.

650
00:47:12,408 --> 00:47:12,830
Rym: the

651
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:13,592
Scott: only way

652
00:47:13,792 --> 00:47:27,621
Rym: and the only reason one-time pads aren't used a lot These days is with computers especially is that They are difficult to use properly Partly because people don't understand them or people think it's stupid to have to throw away the pages or people don't do it Right.

653
00:47:27,862 --> 00:47:28,825
Rym: people reuse them.

654
00:47:29,065 --> 00:47:30,610
Rym: people don't generate random data.

655
00:47:31,252 --> 00:47:33,660
Rym: There's a lot of human problems that cause this to face.

656
00:47:33,841 --> 00:47:43,325
Scott: this is why we use the public and the private keys mostly because the one-time pad while absolutely secure in all ways is Cumbersome.

657
00:47:43,507 --> 00:47:58,840
Rym: Yes now granted it was used a lot during the Cold War a lot of our spies a lot of Russia's spies use one-time pads a lot because Unlike modern encryption with computers one-time pads can be done trivially with a pad of paper.

658
00:47:59,382 --> 00:48:00,726
Rym: You don't need any technology.

659
00:48:00,746 --> 00:48:02,391
Rym: You don't need any special knowledge.

660
00:48:02,853 --> 00:48:05,000
Rym: All you need to be able to do is add numbers to letters.

661
00:48:05,322 --> 00:48:07,399
Scott: Yep, it's pretty simple right there.

662
00:48:08,144 --> 00:48:23,060
Rym: And also despite the fact that it's perfect Unless you fuck it up a lot of data suggests that even when people fucked it up and reused pads The rate of actually truly decrypting the data was still very very low on the order of one to two percent.

663
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:29,965
Scott: Yeah, all these rules that were telling you about burning the piece of paper and never using the same thing twice You know if you got.

664
00:48:30,005 --> 00:48:36,488
Scott: if you follow all those things, that's what you need to do to get a hundred percent guaranteed Encryption where no one could ever figure it out.

665
00:48:36,608 --> 00:48:42,801
Scott: Yeah, even if you don't do all those things perfectly Let's say you screw up a little bit here and there, you know You.

666
00:48:43,022 --> 00:48:44,428
Scott: you forget to burn the paper.

667
00:48:44,448 --> 00:48:51,780
Scott: you use the same thing twice once it's still Close to impossible to figure it out if you do it close to correct.

668
00:48:51,928 --> 00:49:03,280
Rym: Yep The big difference is just that with computer encryption by making it more complex or doing things better The chance of it not being decrypted goes up from 98 to 99 percent which is a big difference.

669
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,868
Scott: that's like a difference of an extra million years of computing.

670
00:49:06,169 --> 00:49:14,978
Rym: but the difference between any non 100% and 100% is effectively infinite because now the time to decrypt is forever.

671
00:49:15,379 --> 00:49:20,084
Scott: Yep They will never figure it out even with a quantum computer Increase.

672
00:49:20,265 --> 00:49:30,479
Rym: one problem with modern encryption is that if you encrypt something now There's no way people will decode it now but a thousand years from now it may be trivial to decrypt it with a one-time pad.

673
00:49:30,499 --> 00:49:40,471
Rym: a Billion years could go by and gods themselves would they exist could not decrypt your message unless they read your mind Yeah, or they could view go back into the past.

674
00:49:40,712 --> 00:49:43,825
Scott: Oh crap, right the messy time travel fucks it up It does.

675
00:49:43,865 --> 00:49:45,316
Scott: time travel fucks up a lot of things.

676
00:49:45,356 --> 00:49:47,225
Rym: Yeah, good thing There's no time travel or like.

677
00:49:47,265 --> 00:50:05,280
Scott: if there was some way to deterministically figure out based on the current, you know like I guess if you could look at the current Configuration of all the matter and energy in the universe and from that figure out any previous Configuration of matter and energy in the universe at any time then all encryption would be useless.

678
00:50:05,421 --> 00:50:09,816
Rym: Now what you've just proposed is a very eloquent way of saying obtaining omniscience.

679
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:14,740
Rym: Yes Hence, yes now encryption has a lot of other uses.

680
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:33,610
Rym: we're not gonna go in a lot of detail here, but one thing you can do and There's a lot of the reasons This is important is you can use things like PGP which is a very common way of encrypting things To not only protect data make sure no one else can read it but to be able to prove Mathematically that you're the one who made that data

681
00:50:34,132 --> 00:50:36,240
Scott: and that that data has not changed?

682
00:50:36,582 --> 00:50:39,379
Rym: Yes, preventing something called a man-in-the-middle attack.

683
00:50:39,861 --> 00:50:58,379
Scott: Well, basically what you do is let's say I have a document and I want to send this document to some people on the internet and I both want to prove that I was the person who wrote this document and You know because someone else out there might take the document Change the words around and then send it out and pretend that I said it.

684
00:50:58,901 --> 00:51:04,780
Scott: I want to prove that you know the copy of the document that you have in your hands is the one that I have written.

685
00:51:05,683 --> 00:51:06,469
Scott: So what do we do?

686
00:51:06,953 --> 00:51:07,639
Scott: we take the key?

687
00:51:08,061 --> 00:51:14,804
Scott: You know the similar key to the ones you're talking about before we apply it to the document and we don't Encrypt the document.

688
00:51:14,885 --> 00:51:18,600
Scott: all the text is left alone, but we put a signature at the bottom.

689
00:51:18,946 --> 00:51:27,314
Scott: It's just a. you know it's stream of random stuff at the bottom and that stream of random stuff is a combination of my key and The data that's on the page.

690
00:51:27,859 --> 00:51:30,680
Scott: now I'll say I use my private key to generate this signature.

691
00:51:31,242 --> 00:51:42,820
Scott: You can use your public key to verify that Yes That signature is put there by the person with the private key and it was on this data above.

692
00:51:43,507 --> 00:51:44,820
Scott: It goes in the backwards way.

693
00:51:45,241 --> 00:51:54,340
Rym: I find it interesting that a lot of people in the world right now and a lot of politicians People really don't trust electronic signatures, and I don't trust a computer.

694
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,489
Rym: I don't trust signing things by typing a password or clicking or whatever.

695
00:51:57,931 --> 00:52:14,528
Rym: and yet the way we trust is to Take up some sort of implement and scribble something on a piece of paper Despite the fact that with an electronic signature you can mathematically verify that it's 99.9% That the person in question actually signed it.

696
00:52:14,789 --> 00:52:20,890
Rym: yet as much as people like to believe it's true It's actually false that handwriting analysis works.

697
00:52:21,031 --> 00:52:22,374
Scott: handwriting is crap.

698
00:52:22,475 --> 00:52:24,260
Rym: handwriting analysis is not a sign.

699
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:30,640
Scott: It's worse than like, you know doing every letter plus one handwriting analysis is pretty much total garbage.

700
00:52:31,322 --> 00:52:32,989
Scott: Yeah, so check it out.

701
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:34,997
Scott: You know, let's say I write a write a note.

702
00:52:35,037 --> 00:52:40,360
Scott: The note is hello I take my private key and I sign that note and at the bottom is a signature.

703
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,976
Scott: That's a bunch of it looks like a weird key Rym.

704
00:52:43,016 --> 00:52:45,640
Scott: gets the note It says hello, and there's a signature at the bottom.

705
00:52:46,101 --> 00:52:51,339
Scott: He takes my public key and he checks it and it says yes Scott wrote this note.

706
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:55,992
Scott: Scott is the person and it says yes, the note is hello.

707
00:52:56,333 --> 00:52:58,700
Scott: That is the note that Scott wrote and has not been changed.

708
00:52:58,901 --> 00:52:59,122
Scott: Yep.

709
00:52:59,825 --> 00:53:03,420
Rym: Now this is very important for a lot of reasons and you can even use this on your own.

710
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,320
Rym: Let's say there's a good example of how you could use this in your daily life.

711
00:53:06,581 --> 00:53:10,520
Rym: Let's say you're an artist and you draw awesome pictures and you put them on the internet.

712
00:53:10,955 --> 00:53:16,105
Rym: well how about every time you make a picture and it's done you Encrypt it and sign it.

713
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:19,454
Rym: because remember signing it also proves when it was signed.

714
00:53:19,935 --> 00:53:21,680
Rym: time is built into this thing.

715
00:53:22,262 --> 00:53:27,200
Rym: So now let's say some moron steals your art and says oh I drew this you can't prove it.

716
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,969
Rym: Look, I've got the picture too and you could argue.

717
00:53:29,989 --> 00:53:31,354
Rym: Yeah, you got it from my website, whatever.

718
00:53:31,394 --> 00:53:39,178
Rym: but there's no way to prove that Except if you've got this signed encrypted copy of the original and the date that it was made.

719
00:53:39,198 --> 00:53:45,538
Rym: it is now Mathematically proven that you created this work of art at least as of the date you signed it.

720
00:53:45,558 --> 00:53:50,316
Scott: now You want to hear a real-world use of this sort of signing that goes on every day.

721
00:53:50,717 --> 00:54:00,979
Scott: It's pretty cool Alright, so if you are a person Let's say you make a piece of software and you distribute it on the internet an exe file and people download it from your website And use it, right?

722
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:10,338
Scott: Well, how do they know that someone didn't hack into your server replace that exe file with some virus and now they're downloading a virus.

723
00:54:10,982 --> 00:54:11,744
Scott: How do they know?

724
00:54:11,945 --> 00:54:17,804
Scott: let's say someone else downloads your exe and puts it up on their website and says yeah I'm mirroring his file.

725
00:54:18,084 --> 00:54:23,340
Scott: Well, how do you know that the file they're mirroring or pretending to mirror isn't actually a virus?

726
00:54:23,862 --> 00:54:27,080
Scott: How do they know that it's the software that you made originally?

727
00:54:27,642 --> 00:54:43,120
Scott: Well, you have a signature or some sort of checksum or hash or some sort of thing in this manner of the signing Something that concisely shows at least that the data hasn't changed or that it is 99% likely that the data hasn't changed.

728
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:53,280
Rym: I mean there are chances that you could find something that satisfies the key Some sort like maybe you could change one letter and you found such a way to where if you changed it the keys still work.

729
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,180
Scott: That's just as hard as breaking the encryption.

730
00:54:55,261 --> 00:54:58,362
Rym: Yes, the odds of that are Astronomical.

731
00:54:58,402 --> 00:55:03,478
Rym: in fact when one is discovered it's a huge deal and it's usually all over the internet.

732
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:08,966
Scott: Yes So if you haven't noticed if you're not a Linux user Linux sort of has these.

733
00:55:09,387 --> 00:55:13,120
Scott: most distributions have certain sort of centralized repository of software.

734
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:19,445
Scott: You get all your software from one big server in the sky and they're really worried about someone Compromising this server.

735
00:55:19,485 --> 00:55:28,173
Scott: because well if you were to put a virus in place of one of the programs on the server You would infect every user of that Linux distribution pretty quickly.

736
00:55:28,675 --> 00:55:39,650
Scott: So they sign absolutely every piece of software on that repository and your computer checks the signatures whether you know it or not of every piece of software.

737
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:45,756
Scott: and if they don't match up Your computer complains and it won't install the software and it says I don't trust that software.

738
00:55:45,796 --> 00:55:46,840
Scott: It's not signed properly.

739
00:55:47,202 --> 00:55:50,340
Scott: I can't be sure that that's from the trustworthy people who make the software.

740
00:55:50,802 --> 00:55:53,112
Scott: I can't be sure that that's the software that they made.

741
00:55:53,454 --> 00:55:54,820
Scott: I can't be sure it wasn't changed.

742
00:55:55,241 --> 00:56:00,056
Scott: I'm not doing shit, and it's really helpful on that note.

743
00:56:00,137 --> 00:56:01,220
Rym: I hope that was informative.

744
00:56:01,642 --> 00:56:05,459
Rym: I plan to eat some more trans fat koalas play some Wesnoth and go to bed.

745
00:56:05,923 --> 00:56:07,859
Scott: I'm gonna beat hotel dusk and go to bed.

746
00:56:14,223 --> 00:56:16,832
