1
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,848
Scott: It's Monday March 3rd.

2
00:00:12,209 --> 00:00:12,771
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,640
Scott: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,058
Scott: What is?

5
00:00:22,513 --> 00:00:23,563
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,584 --> 00:00:26,814
Scott: I Got an announcement to me.

7
00:00:27,315 --> 00:00:28,399
Scott: Oh an announcement.

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,128
Scott: I'm gonna say something that I've been waiting.

9
00:00:31,228 --> 00:00:37,141
Scott: perhaps I don't know if it's exactly six months But around six ish months to say.

10
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:42,498
Scott: I haven't said this in six ish months But I'm gonna say it now what I'll bet.

11
00:00:42,819 --> 00:00:45,127
Rym: I'll bet an amount of money that I can preempt.

12
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:46,030
Rym: what you're about to say.

13
00:00:46,811 --> 00:00:49,998
Scott: Oh, well shall we say it on perhaps the count of three one two three?

14
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:57,837
Scott: warm today Warm yesterday even warmer today.

15
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:01,750
Rym: I think woman is retired until about January.

16
00:01:03,812 --> 00:01:04,678
Scott: January I think it's.

17
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:07,314
Scott: I think it's retired till like October I don't know last year.

18
00:01:07,354 --> 00:01:10,406
Rym: I mean this year and last year didn't really get cold until January.

19
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:16,564
Scott: yeah one thing I realized though I have to go and get rid of these snow tires now and buy regular tires.

20
00:01:16,705 --> 00:01:17,647
Rym: Yes, you do.

21
00:01:17,668 --> 00:01:29,743
Rym: yep I gotta get my seven months behind Car inspected well do it and I gotta buy new tires And I gotta get the headlights fixed and the horn fixed.

22
00:01:29,803 --> 00:01:34,099
Rym: you want to go to the tire this weekend Maybe but Saturday, we're probably gonna go see a show.

23
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:36,590
Scott: so you can go see a show and then go to the tire on Sunday.

24
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:41,588
Rym: Yeah, but the make I gotta go to a regular mechanic and most mechanics Don't know the tire guy actually does all that.

25
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,389
Rym: You know how much he charges for?

26
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,822
Rym: Non-trivial mechanic II stuff.

27
00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:47,910
Scott: you could do your inspection.

28
00:01:48,612 --> 00:01:51,889
Rym: No, we can't cuz it won't pass the inspection until I get a mechanic to fix the things.

29
00:01:52,693 --> 00:01:54,100
Scott: Well that that's a separate problem.

30
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,185
Rym: I busted old car.

31
00:01:55,326 --> 00:01:56,190
Scott: I can't help you with that.

32
00:01:56,592 --> 00:01:59,770
Rym: Yeah, I gotta go to a real mechanic as in a shady mechanic.

33
00:02:00,551 --> 00:02:08,121
Rym: That's how I got the car fixed before I drove into shady mechanic in Yonkers and said all right, dude Well think about shady mechanic in shady neighborhood.

34
00:02:08,422 --> 00:02:10,509
Scott: He deals with far worse cars than yours.

35
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,670
Scott: Yeah, he deals with those cars that are like dragging mufflers on the ground.

36
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:14,576
Rym: I remember I drove in.

37
00:02:14,616 --> 00:02:22,030
Rym: I'm like all right that headlight doesn't work And I don't know why can you fix it for cheap, and he's like well Do you want it to work and you want it to work well?

38
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,067
Rym: And I was like I wanted to pass an inspection to which he said a real inspection.

39
00:02:26,127 --> 00:02:28,836
Rym: or you know I said a real inspection.

40
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:30,641
Rym: He said oh all right hundred bucks.

41
00:02:30,882 --> 00:02:34,753
Rym: What okay, and then $100 later He fixed everything.

42
00:02:34,793 --> 00:02:40,670
Rym: I don't know what he did, but he replaced the whole assembly from some other Sunfire that duct tape and oily rags.

43
00:02:41,873 --> 00:02:46,036
Rym: He had some other Sunfire that someone had smashed So he just took the whole headlight assembly out of it.

44
00:02:46,297 --> 00:02:47,441
Scott: probably that's it doesn't?

45
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:49,107
Scott: I guess that's pretty easy if you're a mechanic.

46
00:02:49,207 --> 00:02:53,000
Scott: a yeah All right, so yeah, no not much else besides that.

47
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:55,290
Rym: no weekend was nice and relaxing.

48
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,061
Rym: I played some half-life too since I was booted into windows.

49
00:02:58,141 --> 00:03:00,210
Rym: I yeah, I also played with my laptop a lot.

50
00:03:00,512 --> 00:03:02,390
Scott: What sucked today is that in the morning?

51
00:03:02,491 --> 00:03:04,804
Scott: I had like a sweater and a coat and then on the way home.

52
00:03:04,845 --> 00:03:09,636
Scott: I was like ah shit I'm gonna carry this shit But that's the end.

53
00:03:09,676 --> 00:03:11,870
Scott: the sweaters are going in the closet, and they're probably not coming out.

54
00:03:12,031 --> 00:03:13,236
Rym: That's the one benefit of the.

55
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:16,290
Rym: never wear long sleeves ever unless I'm going to a formal ball.

56
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:26,649
Rym: Yeah, except for the it'll get cold because and you know what it's not cold in the office And when I'm outside of the office or outside of my house, we're in a coat.

57
00:03:27,312 --> 00:03:31,185
Scott: Yeah, I have a coat sometimes not enough to be fully warm, and you don't have a good coat.

58
00:03:31,647 --> 00:03:35,589
Rym: my coat is excellent All right, so what are you on the news?

59
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,632
Rym: I don't really.

60
00:03:36,652 --> 00:03:43,678
Scott: I don't really have news so much and it's not really a geek bite because I great because they don't really have The product to review it.

61
00:03:44,121 --> 00:03:50,750
Scott: I sort of want to do like a general Informative thing about a category of product that you may or may not know exists.

62
00:03:51,031 --> 00:04:00,789
Scott: Uh-huh, yeah, I've been looking into these recently for many reasons and also you know some other my co-workers are also looking into them for various other reasons.

63
00:04:00,809 --> 00:04:09,119
Scott: and Basically you know when you buy a desktop computer on Newegg right the motherboard you get is ATX form factor.

64
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,629
Scott: most likely you know.

65
00:04:11,612 --> 00:04:22,946
Scott: And that's you know that's that's a set of specifications about where the screw holes are how big the motherboard is Where the things on the motherboard are located the what kind of power supply connector etc.

66
00:04:22,986 --> 00:04:23,267
Scott: etc.

67
00:04:23,287 --> 00:04:39,244
Scott: right well there are other choices besides ATX such as ITX and also Nano ITX don't forget AT AT the old one and also Pico ITX.

68
00:04:40,274 --> 00:04:41,840
Rym: Now I remember a long time ago.

69
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,815
Rym: I used to make jokes about how yeah, we should make Pico ITX and they get.

70
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:47,059
Scott: well they have Pico ITX.

71
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:49,566
Scott: yeah, it's a real thing basically little.

72
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:54,578
Scott: what these are is their motherboards But they're full computers.

73
00:04:54,638 --> 00:05:14,170
Scott: They they have a CPU a sound card a video card Storage you know IO Connections a battery a network card usually pretty much everything or at least you know some sort of stripped-down Limited feature version of what a normal desktop computer has but very very small.

74
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:37,890
Scott: so you can go out and you can buy for usually under $400 a Computer that is wicked small like wicked small we're talking like a few inches by a few inches right uses very little electricity Makes no noise because it has no fans Usually uses flash, but you can use like compact flash or even a little laptop hard drive if you want.

75
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:46,890
Scott: but that'll make noise and heat and whatever and Is usually powerful enough to do a whole bunch of computing tasks?

76
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,701
Scott: I mean you can't play games on it.

77
00:05:48,943 --> 00:05:53,384
Scott: obviously well I guess you could play minesweeper on it, but you could play doom - it's all you need.

78
00:05:53,405 --> 00:05:54,710
Scott: you could probably play doom - on it.

79
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,404
Rym: Yeah, I can play doom - on a 486 with 4 megs of RAM.

80
00:05:58,811 --> 00:06:01,459
Scott: You usually won't use this as a desktop computer.

81
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:18,980
Scott: what you'll use this for is say you want to have a monitor Hanging on the wall somewhere in your office That's showing like graphs of real-time data or You want to have a kiosk in the mall that people will come up to and there'll be some software on it running that they can interact with.

82
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:24,029
Scott: or You want to have a server in your house that runs DHCP DNS?

83
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:33,750
Scott: Maybe a little web server, maybe a little SSH Maybe a firewall something like that stuff that isn't to you know processor or performance intensive.

84
00:06:33,991 --> 00:06:35,758
Rym: You're not running the raid 5.

85
00:06:35,758 --> 00:06:36,742
Rym: San off of this thing.

86
00:06:36,822 --> 00:06:43,200
Scott: no no we're just talking about you know just Software that will run on pretty much any computer of any performance.

87
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:50,150
Scott: you can run it on a really tiny quiet relatively cheap Computer that you can just sort of hide away and doesn't use much electricity.

88
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,214
Scott: You know no reason to.

89
00:06:51,234 --> 00:06:54,267
Scott: I mean you could scrap together parts and build like a $50 computer.

90
00:06:55,411 --> 00:06:56,234
Scott: You know that's just.

91
00:06:56,294 --> 00:07:01,369
Scott: but it'll be some old-ass giant desktop making lots of noise heat and using a lot of electricity.

92
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:06,950
Scott: so I Just want to make people aware that these products exist that there are.

93
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:09,077
Scott: There's actually there used to be.

94
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,448
Scott: these used to be really expensive and they used to be not a lot of choice.

95
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:15,478
Scott: and most Of them were for you know industrial purposes.

96
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,556
Scott: You know like use it in a factory, and it's in some case That's like wicked.

97
00:07:19,657 --> 00:07:21,470
Scott: You know durable and invincible.

98
00:07:21,911 --> 00:07:25,082
Scott: So you saw the factory explodes it'll be okay, or if acid gets on it.

99
00:07:25,102 --> 00:07:27,590
Scott: It'll be okay, but now this you know more.

100
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:35,170
Scott: You know consumer type ones, and you can customize them for all sorts of uses and these will be useful for many people.

101
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:38,246
Scott: You can do Linux Windows pretty much any OS except.

102
00:07:38,306 --> 00:07:39,030
Scott: I guess Mac OS.

103
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,461
Scott: That's not gonna work, but yeah be aware of these.

104
00:07:42,502 --> 00:07:43,505
Scott: they may be good for you.

105
00:07:43,986 --> 00:07:48,127
Rym: so in actual news There's a bunch of tech news last week, and I had to actually pick and choose.

106
00:07:48,147 --> 00:07:48,670
Rym: There's a lot here.

107
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:58,284
Rym: There's also a lot of meat space news going on with the let's say the the fun with our friend You go Chavez down south save your meat space news for Thursday.

108
00:07:58,364 --> 00:07:59,649
Rym: always a riot that guy.

109
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:08,708
Rym: Anyway, I will talk about that later cuz I actually got a lot to say about this and hopefully by Thursday We'll know if this leads to war in South America or not.

110
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:16,129
Rym: Yeah Nothing bad could ever happen with South American war.

111
00:08:16,852 --> 00:08:19,679
Rym: Luckily, there's no chance of a CIA intervention or anything.

112
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:30,750
Rym: is there's not like we've ever done that before no CIA in South America intervening in some sort of Military operation possibly involving some sort of industrial complex?

113
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:32,136
Scott: I never heard of such a thing,

114
00:08:32,499 --> 00:08:49,190
Rym: but this news might seem a little off the wall But I think it's warranted because we talk a lot about technology And I think we even did a show about how there are a lot of problems in the world that if you applied a little Bit of common sense and a little bit of properly put together technology these problems could be alleviated trivially.

115
00:08:49,893 --> 00:08:53,550
Rym: There is a kind of annoying problem in the world, and I've run into this a lot.

116
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:59,270
Rym: I'm sure a lot of you fly have that it takes for fucking ever to get people onto a plane.

117
00:09:00,112 --> 00:09:06,849
Rym: Yeah, an airport and they line people up but people don't line up and they call people up in certain orders and all this business.

118
00:09:06,869 --> 00:09:10,730
Rym: and There have been a lot of studies about the fastest way to load a plane.

119
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:17,950
Scott: I think the number one problem right is that people get on the plane and they get to their seat And they don't step out of the aisle quick enough.

120
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:23,490
Scott: They'll stay in the aisle try to get their stuff in the overhead bins, which they're not good at at all.

121
00:09:23,953 --> 00:09:34,390
Scott: Right, they have no skill at loading the overhead bins And then everyone basically who needs to get past them stands in the aisle behind them not moving and it takes forever.

122
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:35,393
Rym: Now wouldn't?

123
00:09:35,414 --> 00:09:40,110
Rym: wouldn't an obvious way to get around this be to load the plane from the back to the front?

124
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,462
Rym: So there's no way anyone could be blocking they else.

125
00:09:42,543 --> 00:09:43,206
Scott: they do this.

126
00:09:43,327 --> 00:09:44,815
Rym: most airports Don't see?

127
00:09:44,856 --> 00:09:47,130
Scott: when I when I get on it like a jet blue plane, right?

128
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:52,591
Scott: They'll say everyone is sitting in rows like 20 through 25.

129
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:53,638
Scott: Please come up right.

130
00:09:53,981 --> 00:10:06,189
Scott: and the problem is of course someone in row 20 gets on before the 25 people right and is really slow at putting their luggage up or the person with the Window seat gets on before the person with the aisle seat.

131
00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:08,114
Scott: I mean You know vice-versa.

132
00:10:08,134 --> 00:10:13,090
Scott: so the aisle person keeps the window person out and then people have to get out and then back into their seats.

133
00:10:13,251 --> 00:10:21,398
Rym: Well, I'll put it this way Two studies at least have shown that the the Average way that the average airline in the u.s.

134
00:10:21,438 --> 00:10:29,620
Rym: Loads planes is close to the worst possible way You could do it in terms of efficiency Alrighty, and that the best way to do I never really.

135
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,490
Scott: I have flown maybe twice in my life on non jet blue So I don't know much about any other airline.

136
00:10:34,691 --> 00:10:41,994
Rym: I've only actually flown jet blue once and if you're going somewhere jet blue goes and you're not a business traveler who wants some nice Like first-class whatever.

137
00:10:42,014 --> 00:10:45,790
Rym: it's pretty nice and a lot of the problems of other airlines go away.

138
00:10:45,891 --> 00:10:53,552
Scott: The only other airline I've ever heard that is very nice Is that is the Virgin Airlines and from what I've gathered to go to like if I was going to UK I'd probably take them.

139
00:10:53,572 --> 00:10:58,549
Rym: from what I've gathered almost every airline that flies around Europe is awesome compared to most us.

140
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:03,145
Scott: Oh, yeah, like I always see like ads for Lufthansa and it looks so nice.

141
00:11:03,185 --> 00:11:03,586
Rym: Of course.

142
00:11:03,626 --> 00:11:04,770
Rym: That's like first class.

143
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:16,712
Scott: I saw I saw a YouTube video of the inside of first class of an airplane going to Dubai Man, yes, if they had more gadgets built into that first-class seat than we have in this whole house You know what?

144
00:11:16,732 --> 00:11:19,510
Rym: I could imagine I wouldn't be surprised if I were to Bay.

145
00:11:19,871 --> 00:11:28,808
Rym: I would simply state that you can't have coach and still fly into our airport because obviously those people can't afford to be here pretty much next up Monaco.

146
00:11:29,877 --> 00:11:44,905
Rym: but no the Deal here is that they've pretty much determined that if you just force everyone to line up in order By row ahead of time before the plane is ready to be loaded or At least half the people load out like make them stand in line in order.

147
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:53,894
Rym: if you're not in the right place You have to wait till everyone else is on board punish him in that way and then just load people row by row seat by seat Strict order.

148
00:11:54,276 --> 00:11:57,270
Rym: No one gets any say no one gets any sort of special treatment.

149
00:11:57,574 --> 00:11:58,470
Scott: Well, that's another thing.

150
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,036
Scott: Is that a lot even on jet blue?

151
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:03,490
Scott: what they do and I think it's an FAA regulation is they say anyone who needs help?

152
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:11,448
Scott: Getting on the plane get on first, right and they take care of you like if you're an old person who can't walk or if you have a wheelchair or if you have a baby or something.

153
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:18,110
Scott: and Really when you think about it, it would be more optimal to have those last people unless put them on first.

154
00:12:18,311 --> 00:12:20,720
Rym: Actually, I read an article that said just as much.

155
00:12:21,343 --> 00:12:22,587
Rym: Yeah, because they go one else in the way.

156
00:12:22,668 --> 00:12:23,190
Rym: No one moving.

157
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:25,138
Scott: Yeah, pretty much those people right?

158
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:27,789
Scott: It's it's tough to get them on it takes some time.

159
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:33,230
Scott: So what you do is instead of putting them on first forcing everyone else you can get on quickly to wait.

160
00:12:33,593 --> 00:12:44,520
Scott: You let everyone get on real quick Then you get the slow people on and then you go and there's no there's no delaying the quick peep You know, there's no chance of the slow people holding up the quick people.

161
00:12:44,821 --> 00:12:47,831
Rym: now sadly while this article is all like on all these Articles.

162
00:12:47,872 --> 00:12:50,141
Rym: Yeah, you could really super efficient eyes.

163
00:12:50,161 --> 00:12:50,904
Rym: I like that.

164
00:12:50,924 --> 00:12:52,169
Rym: I'm gonna say that word more often.

165
00:12:52,953 --> 00:12:54,561
Scott: There really isn't another word for that.

166
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:58,419
Scott: I needed to say if she buys Okay, no, but demise is close.

167
00:12:58,439 --> 00:13:08,701
Scott: Well, you have to say optimize the efficiency, you know It's like a two-word saying optimize the efficiency just reeks of Utilizing the buzz and see ya maximize the okay.

168
00:13:09,002 --> 00:13:10,547
Scott: Yes, so we need a new.

169
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:11,630
Scott: we need to efficient eyes.

170
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:14,858
Scott: I think has to be a word now the the real.

171
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:20,786
Rym: I mean this article like oh, yeah, we could do this, but The the studies do overlook one important thing

172
00:13:20,987 --> 00:13:22,826
Scott: a human psychology the fact

173
00:13:22,846 --> 00:13:34,707
Rym: that When you fly and I've seen this every time ever flown It seems that the majority of the people getting on the plane are Families who have probably never flown before or in the very least don't fly often.

174
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:36,595
Scott: Yeah a lot See, it's like Pete.

175
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:40,030
Scott: you can tell like it's the same thing like in New York City, right?

176
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,352
Scott: You can tell tourists apart from business people I remember there are.

177
00:13:43,392 --> 00:13:50,196
Rym: when we say tourists we're using the derogatory term because there are people who technically are tourists who are not in fact Tourists,

178
00:13:50,276 --> 00:14:00,136
Scott: right but you can tell like a businessman He goes whoosh right down the street walks right into the subway gets right on the subway car gets right off Goes in the right direction all the time.

179
00:14:00,156 --> 00:14:04,190
Rym: He got he dodges around people and he just puts his bag up sits down.

180
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,399
Scott: He's asleep before you even seem that right.

181
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,010
Scott: but the tourists like they'll walk though.

182
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:15,750
Scott: They'll walk side by side blocking the sidewalk They'll walk down the street and then suddenly stop in their tracks.

183
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:22,265
Rym: So worse and behind the bumping into the words to the people in DC on those long-ass Escalators who'll just stand right in the middle.

184
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:22,869
Rym: Oh, you mean us.

185
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:28,692
Rym: You see luckily there were many people around now when we did that and we did it knowing that it was a bad thing to Do.

186
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:41,949
Scott: yeah, but you know It's in general people who are don't fly often get in the way of the people who do fly often just like people in New York City who aren't there often get in the way of me every day.

187
00:14:42,712 --> 00:14:43,535
Rym: Yeah, out of my way.

188
00:14:43,756 --> 00:14:45,764
Rym: The thing is flying if you look at it.

189
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:57,230
Rym: It's not like it's a cryptic thing I mean if you don't know how the New York City subway works Or even if you've never taken like a New York Metro North kind of train before No one's there to help you you kind of have to figure it.

190
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:00,650
Rym: I mean if you ask someone they'll tell you like oh, this is the train to blah blah blah and everyone's super nice.

191
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:10,447
Rym: but well if you just show up on a platform you just show up on this platform and it says This is the name of the platform and trains are coming in both directions and you know, which ones?

192
00:15:10,487 --> 00:15:15,824
Scott: what you know What I think, you know Really the most efficient way to deal with the airplane boarding problem.

193
00:15:15,945 --> 00:15:16,406
Scott: is that just?

194
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:21,230
Rym: it's not even something People consider have classes in high school to teach people how to get on a goddamn plane.

195
00:15:21,431 --> 00:15:23,665
Scott: That would be I guess maybe help but no check this out.

196
00:15:23,685 --> 00:15:31,630
Scott: when you go to an airport Right, you go through security and then the plane usually is already there at the gate connected to the gate, right?

197
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:40,461
Scott: And they make you wait there like out, you know in the airport terminal for a while Right, and it's just pretty much.

198
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,810
Scott: then they say okay now we're all gonna get on the plane.

199
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:50,700
Rym: Well, a lot of that is FAA regulations exactly cleaning the plane usually getting it ready Right, right, right, but basically they get you.

200
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:56,260
Scott: they don't start boarding the plane till like, you know a few minutes Maybe ten minutes at most before it's going to leave.

201
00:15:57,511 --> 00:16:01,785
Rym: Usually the plane actually isn't ready until then even so a lot of times.

202
00:16:01,886 --> 00:16:03,070
Scott: It's like it's just sitting there.

203
00:16:03,652 --> 00:16:05,240
Scott: You know, it looks pretty ready to me.

204
00:16:06,853 --> 00:16:08,440
Scott: You can sit in it while they're fueling it.

205
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,328
Scott: You can sit in it while they're all you can't.

206
00:16:10,488 --> 00:16:10,830
Scott: why not?

207
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,120
Scott: There's rules against that.

208
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,603
Scott: I know there are rules against it But why actually there's rules against that?

209
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,709
Rym: on a lot of buses too.

210
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:29,649
Rym: Anyone who's taking a long bus trip in America has learned that if you get on the wrong bus They'll stop every time to get gas Wake everyone up make him get off and stand out in the cold While they drive the bus over and fill it up drive it back and let you back on.

211
00:16:29,971 --> 00:16:31,598
Scott: Why can't you sit on it while it's fueling?

212
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:32,643
Rym: there's rules about that.

213
00:16:33,065 --> 00:16:34,150
Scott: That's a rule that makes no sense.

214
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,175
Rym: Does it might blow up?

215
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,165
Scott: Oh, it's gave it has gas in it.

216
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:38,130
Scott: Anyway, it might blow up.

217
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,497
Scott: Anyway, it's not gonna.

218
00:16:39,618 --> 00:16:50,355
Rym: there's no more risk of blowing up while fueling then Something and this is definitely not a blanket like this is not a truth of the world because there are people have legitimate uses for these things and there are circumstances where they're warranted.

219
00:16:50,857 --> 00:17:05,790
Rym: but multiple people have pointed out on slash job and I've seen this sentiment elsewhere that the best way to make airlines more efficient would be to ban Anyone who shows up with wheelies on their baggage if the baggage is smaller than a gigantic bag.

220
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:06,730
Scott: I agree with that.

221
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,994
Rym: Like if the bag is smaller than your torso and it has wheels Just ban him from flying.

222
00:17:11,015 --> 00:17:15,410
Scott: If your bag has wheels and you aren't checking it, then it shouldn't have wheels.

223
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:17,709
Scott: If it has wheels, it's not a carry-on.

224
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,195
Rym: If you can't carry it, it's not a carry-on.

225
00:17:19,236 --> 00:17:24,365
Scott: and if you can carry it It shouldn't have wheels because you can carry it.

226
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:33,880
Rym: actually though I think pursuant to all that if you think about it another big problem You see a lot of people have carry-on that like I actually check like I look at the dimensions I make sure my carry-on is like within the legal.

227
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,964
Rym: like this is what you can bring.

228
00:17:35,084 --> 00:17:38,476
Scott: I only ever carry on stuff I actually need on the plane.

229
00:17:38,497 --> 00:17:45,924
Rym: Well actually before all these BS rules about can't have toothpaste or whatever I would never check bags when I flew because I didn't need that much.

230
00:17:46,205 --> 00:17:48,135
Rym: I'd bring the two carry-ons I'm allowed.

231
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:57,697
Rym: one was full of all my stuff But if it within the thing and one was full of all my entertainment for the flight And then I didn't have to deal with bag check or anything in and out See thing is thing is you know.

232
00:17:57,838 --> 00:18:07,003
Scott: after you know, because I flew quite often when I was in college But you know back and forth from Rochester Checking I would always check exactly one bag and carry on my backpack.

233
00:18:07,043 --> 00:18:07,766
Scott: and that's what I would do.

234
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:13,367
Scott: the same exact thing every time Right, and it was always cake because I would just I knew exactly what to do.

235
00:18:13,407 --> 00:18:15,998
Scott: I'd walk up I would just dump my check bag.

236
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:17,706
Scott: I'll give them my ID and my ticket.

237
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:18,369
Scott: They would go.

238
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:19,938
Scott: Yep Yep, they would ask me all the questions.

239
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:20,502
Scott: I would say yes.

240
00:18:20,522 --> 00:18:20,743
Scott: Yes.

241
00:18:20,804 --> 00:18:21,106
Scott: No, no.

242
00:18:21,146 --> 00:18:21,347
Scott: Yes.

243
00:18:21,387 --> 00:18:29,070
Scott: No, right I would just walk over to the security go right through and get on the plane Get off the plane go wait on the little conveyor belt.

244
00:18:29,231 --> 00:18:32,886
Scott: My bag would usually come out in like 10 minutes grab and go and that was it.

245
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:33,388
Scott: it was.

246
00:18:33,408 --> 00:18:38,358
Rym: but then again I mean I flew a bunch of other airlines and I never had a problem with jet blue But I've only flown him once.

247
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:44,627
Rym: so I can't but a lot of times I'd show up and that the line to even check a bag would be like 45 minutes long.

248
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:49,285
Scott: There's sometimes there would be a line to check the bag But you got it, you know you get there early enough.

249
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:53,645
Scott: and the worst thing That's only really crazy holidays and really easy time blue.

250
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:54,930
Rym: when I flew to Arizona, right?

251
00:18:55,454 --> 00:18:55,838
Rym: It wasn't.

252
00:18:55,898 --> 00:18:57,150
Rym: it wasn't even a full flight.

253
00:18:57,431 --> 00:19:01,788
Rym: I had a full row to just kind of sprawl out and go on the way home and everything.

254
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:02,170
Rym: Mm-hmm.

255
00:19:02,372 --> 00:19:08,907
Rym: but yet when I got back to JFK I had to stand there for an hour before my bag showed up.

256
00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:09,730
Scott: That's a long time.

257
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,336
Scott: Usually I've never had to wait that long.

258
00:19:11,356 --> 00:19:13,946
Rym: Well, I've had to wait that long 50% of the times.

259
00:19:14,026 --> 00:19:25,376
Rym: I have no jet blue Oh yeah, but I find this article interesting because basically the gist of it is just that there are more efficient ways to do this and Airlines by and large don't.

260
00:19:25,738 --> 00:19:35,810
Rym: and the main reason they don't is because public perception is Kind of wrong and like people would like if you did it the intelligent way people would complain.

261
00:19:36,231 --> 00:19:37,074
Rym: So they do it the way.

262
00:19:37,115 --> 00:19:50,782
Rym: that's not intelligent but looks intelligent to people who are dumb and as a result Everyone's mildly angry, but I guess that's better than people being more angry But actually getting on the plane because you change anything people will be angry.

263
00:19:50,842 --> 00:19:54,749
Scott: if it had been a different way This whole time, you know.

264
00:19:55,091 --> 00:19:57,890
Scott: Then if you change it to the way it is now people would be angry.

265
00:19:58,252 --> 00:19:58,534
Scott: It doesn't.

266
00:19:58,595 --> 00:20:00,690
Scott: it has nothing to do with the way it actually is.

267
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,172
Scott: Let's do it.

268
00:20:01,192 --> 00:20:02,899
Scott: the fact that you're changing something.

269
00:20:02,939 --> 00:20:12,909
Rym: Therefore people get upset no matter what you change, of course There's also the idea that if you just say alright go and let everyone just get on the plane willy-nilly It's still faster than the way they do it now.

270
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:15,602
Scott: So that's I'm saying they should just let everyone.

271
00:20:15,622 --> 00:20:22,370
Scott: you know, as soon as the plane is ready Just let anyone get on the plane whenever they want and then the plane takes off at the scheduled time.

272
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,559
Scott: If you're not on the plane, fuck you.

273
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:35,784
Rym: Yeah, the problem with that however, is that a lot of times people are making a connecting flight and if the airline screws someone else over If your plane if your plane is delayed and you don't make the connecting flight.

274
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:39,037
Scott: Oh, well, that's your you know You bought a connecting flight.

275
00:20:39,057 --> 00:20:41,770
Scott: You knew that that was a risk and you I just had to take the next plane.

276
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:47,769
Rym: Yeah, but the one time that happened to me that the flights were two hours apart and yet the plane still fucked me.

277
00:20:48,939 --> 00:20:53,206
Scott: Well Hey, that's that's that's a risk you take when connecting flights.

278
00:20:53,246 --> 00:20:53,910
Scott: get a direct flight.

279
00:20:54,292 --> 00:20:57,029
Scott: Yeah, sometimes it's not a more for a direct flight to reduce risk.

280
00:20:57,392 --> 00:20:59,770
Rym: I actually know a lot of times direct flights are cheaper if you get them early enough.

281
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,516
Rym: It was more that there were no direct flights.

282
00:21:01,657 --> 00:21:02,721
Scott: Well, then what can you do?

283
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:05,090
Rym: Never fly to Detroit ever?

284
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:06,250
Scott: All right.

285
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,251
Scott: Can we move on?

286
00:21:07,471 --> 00:21:08,072
Rym: I think we can.

287
00:21:14,979 --> 00:21:16,460
Rym: so things of the day.

288
00:21:16,962 --> 00:21:22,650
Rym: I'm sure Scott the other Scott will be pleased with this and I'm also pleased with this because I rather enjoyed it.

289
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:29,840
Rym: and even if you do not know anything about the subject at hand I recommend you take this quiz because by and large the second hint is always hilarious.

290
00:21:30,364 --> 00:21:38,340
Scott: I I don't know much about the subject matter But the quiz gives you so many blatant obvious hints that it's really stupidly easy.

291
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:40,367
Rym: This is a pretty cool quiz though.

292
00:21:40,427 --> 00:21:42,694
Rym: It is the booze test and I'll warn you.

293
00:21:42,714 --> 00:21:44,420
Rym: I got almost a perfect score.

294
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,747
Rym: I don't know what that says about me.

295
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:48,500
Scott: I don't think it's that I mean I would have if I had taken the test.

296
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:50,308
Scott: I would have gotten close to a per.

297
00:21:50,328 --> 00:21:52,035
Rym: no you wouldn't know because you wouldn't have gotten them all.

298
00:21:52,056 --> 00:22:03,660
Rym: on the first question Basically you get four hints and there's a list of answers and You can either guess or get the next hints or guess or get the next hint.

299
00:22:04,101 --> 00:22:07,234
Scott: So every time you get a hint here, you just not didn't get a perfect score.

300
00:22:07,355 --> 00:22:09,021
Rym: Yeah, you keep going down All right.

301
00:22:09,222 --> 00:22:15,000
Rym: So if you get a very high score on this, you're probably in the Rym realm of alcohol usage.

302
00:22:16,423 --> 00:22:18,780
Rym: But I'll give you so I'll go through the Thunderbird wine.

303
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:21,730
Rym: This is it's a really fun really well done quiz like.

304
00:22:21,931 --> 00:22:22,614
Rym: here's an example.

305
00:22:22,654 --> 00:22:28,799
Rym: the first question clue number one I am made with the flowers and leaves a medicinal plant called wormwood.

306
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:31,772
Rym: now Anyone who drinks should know immediately what that is.

307
00:22:31,873 --> 00:22:36,595
Scott: or anyone who reads I do not know I do not know what alcohol is is made of fermented wormwood.

308
00:22:36,615 --> 00:22:37,239
Scott: I'll be honest.

309
00:22:37,379 --> 00:22:39,527
Rym: now You should because it's all it's pretty cool.

310
00:22:39,547 --> 00:22:39,989
Rym: Now.

311
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:44,912
Rym: The next clue is a picture of absinthe.

312
00:22:45,178 --> 00:22:46,427
Scott: oh I guess it's absent.

313
00:22:46,648 --> 00:22:50,128
Rym: Yes now that is only if you know That it is absinthe.

314
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,315
Scott: But how would I tell it?

315
00:22:51,596 --> 00:22:52,220
Scott: What does it look like?

316
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,230
Rym: It's bright green with that special spoon.

317
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,879
Rym: anyone who's read anything about?

318
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,082
Rym: Bohemia or any?

319
00:22:57,162 --> 00:22:57,744
Scott: I might.

320
00:22:58,105 --> 00:23:00,311
Rym: that might be Moulin Rouge if you've ever.

321
00:23:00,392 --> 00:23:00,853
Rym: you'll know.

322
00:23:00,873 --> 00:23:04,003
Scott: a green liquid with a spoon might get me to Guess absinthe.

323
00:23:04,023 --> 00:23:04,686
Scott: What's the next hint?

324
00:23:04,907 --> 00:23:13,544
Scott: The next one is I'm illegal in the United States, which is not true anymore And that would have tipped me off immediately because I knew that that was an urban legend and I would I would complain and I Would get that.

325
00:23:13,585 --> 00:23:15,480
Scott: and then I'm because it is multiple choice, right?

326
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,277
Scott: I don't have to type in absinthe absinthe one of the available choices.

327
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:20,129
Scott: Yes Yeah, so I would ease I would get that.

328
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:21,679
Scott: on the second or third one green fair.

329
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:26,589
Rym: now I think the best one is The kamikaze they drink.

330
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:29,059
Rym: and the first hint is like, you know, it's made of blah blah blah.

331
00:23:29,521 --> 00:23:35,460
Rym: The second hint is a picture of a kamikaze attack from World War II and it's multiple choice.

332
00:23:35,661 --> 00:23:37,190
Scott: Yeah, there's no way you can miss that.

333
00:23:37,231 --> 00:23:39,845
Scott: or like if you do nothing about alcohol You couldn't miss the gin.

334
00:23:39,906 --> 00:23:42,780
Rym: The first one is like, you know, I'm flavored with juniper berries.

335
00:23:42,981 --> 00:23:45,549
Rym: All right, that's how I knew because I freaking love juniper berries.

336
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,660
Rym: number two is a picture of one of those beef eaters.

337
00:23:50,942 --> 00:23:57,215
Rym: It's like okay talk about easy Yeah, but if anyone else gets a near-perfect score, my head is off to you.

338
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:58,580
Scott: Well, you just give them a bunch of answers.

339
00:23:59,861 --> 00:24:02,954
Rym: They will not get a perfect score if they do not actually know about alcohol.

340
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:05,724
Rym: All right, if you say so This is pretty fun though.

341
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:06,185
Rym: Check it out.

342
00:24:06,466 --> 00:24:12,909
Scott: Okay, so I recently discovered this little open-source project from Sun Microsystems no less.

343
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:17,140
Scott: Sun Microsystems actually Java's looking better and better every day.

344
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,034
Scott: I'll talk about that sometime in the future, but I'll leave it at that for now.

345
00:24:20,114 --> 00:24:21,400
Scott: Sun is doing some good stuff.

346
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,059
Scott: They're sort of they're rebounding at least in my eyes.

347
00:24:24,742 --> 00:24:26,828
Scott: Anyway, they have a project.

348
00:24:26,888 --> 00:24:29,676
Scott: It's open source called project dark star.

349
00:24:29,877 --> 00:24:30,679
Scott: Sounds pretty cool, huh?

350
00:24:32,081 --> 00:24:34,930
Scott: Well, what now go on?

351
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,174
Scott: you don't think dark star is cool.

352
00:24:36,635 --> 00:24:38,160
Rym: the name dark star is amazing.

353
00:24:38,422 --> 00:24:39,488
Scott: All right, that's what I'm talking about.

354
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:50,820
Scott: So this project dark star The goal of this project is is basically the thing I find most interesting about it Is it doesn't seem to have any competition, right now?

355
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,711
Scott: Basically, what it is is it's an.

356
00:24:54,174 --> 00:24:57,449
Scott: it's a multiplayer Game server engine.

357
00:24:58,031 --> 00:25:00,379
Scott: So it's not actually a game engine.

358
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:04,719
Scott: It won't help you with you know, making your game or your 3ds or anything like that.

359
00:25:05,183 --> 00:25:07,139
Scott: It helps you with making your game server.

360
00:25:07,682 --> 00:25:11,840
Scott: So if you want to make a game, you know, most likely an MMO that's sort of what it's designed for.

361
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:19,520
Scott: Where any game where there are lots of players sharing, you know the same space the same resources.

362
00:25:19,641 --> 00:25:29,478
Scott: this project dark star is a server framework that will allow you to easily develop and deploy a server that can handle that.

363
00:25:29,598 --> 00:25:37,860
Scott: and you know It's still not you know production worthy yet But in the future it their goal is to have it be very scalable.

364
00:25:38,029 --> 00:25:45,403
Scott: so you know making an MMO game is very expensive and one of the most expensive parts is making the server and getting all the servers up and whatnot.

365
00:25:45,504 --> 00:26:04,532
Scott: and if there is sort of this, you know one really good platform for developing those servers and handling them then that could significantly decrease the costs of Making and running MMOs and maybe you could do away with like, you know The monthly fees or at least severely lower the the fees to the players.

366
00:26:04,712 --> 00:26:11,720
Rym: or maybe someone awesome would take this sort of thing And make an MMO because we've hinted at this a little bit in the forums.

367
00:26:11,901 --> 00:26:13,889
Rym: That is not an RPG or no.

368
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:15,435
Rym: No, maybe you see the problem.

369
00:26:15,516 --> 00:26:15,837
Rym: Is that?

370
00:26:16,379 --> 00:26:36,096
Rym: and memorpica, you know MMORPG and MMO and RPG have all kind of turned into very specific genres, even though originally I mean a role-playing game was a game where I play a role And it's kind of gotten to the point where role-playing games have so little role-playing and you're

371
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:36,277
Scott: heading.

372
00:26:36,297 --> 00:26:41,371
Rym: you're heading to Tuesday territory Yes, but I mean it's relevant in science in computing.

373
00:26:41,712 --> 00:26:46,179
Rym: One of the most important things is having a shared useful nomenclature.

374
00:26:46,263 --> 00:26:51,445
Rym: I mean this is why we had the debate over Pluto and Scientists said Pluto is not a planet.

375
00:26:51,866 --> 00:26:55,616
Rym: and anyone who disagreed with that statement who is not a scientist is a moron.

376
00:26:55,897 --> 00:27:01,850
Rym: because basically Calling Pluto a planet makes the term planet useless.

377
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:13,080
Rym: because by if Pluto is a planet then there are hundreds of other things That are equally as useless as Pluto that also have to be called planets or else We've just diluted the term planet to be useless to scientists.

378
00:27:13,481 --> 00:27:18,477
Scott: Yeah, I mean, well, you know if we decide that you know, it's like a meter is exactly this long.

379
00:27:18,538 --> 00:27:22,000
Scott: if we decide Oh, well, that's a meter too for sentimental reasons.

380
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:38,634
Rym: Well now the term meter is useless in you know scientific discussions I feel like the term MMO is useless now because most people know MMO means a grind based Massively multiplayer stateful avatar game.

381
00:27:39,036 --> 00:27:40,100
Scott: Do you really you really think so?

382
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,779
Scott: Cuz I think a morpiga is definitely, you know, but well, I think MMO.

383
00:27:44,261 --> 00:27:46,489
Rym: I think common parlay parlance.

384
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:50,227
Rym: Most people say MMO to mean World of Warcraft I think.

385
00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:51,520
Scott: I think you may be right there.

386
00:27:51,600 --> 00:28:04,460
Scott: But I also think that if someone were to specifically say MMO FPS or MMO RTS or MMO something else that or MMO puzzle All right that people would you know not associate it with more paga?

387
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:10,539
Rym: Well, I guess I feel that if we don't change course soon that will no longer be true And MMO will be a genre in and of itself.

388
00:28:10,881 --> 00:28:13,735
Rym: I think that I think as opposed to what it should be which is just a medium.

389
00:28:14,076 --> 00:28:16,563
Scott: Yeah, pretty much Ah, it just does.

390
00:28:16,603 --> 00:28:22,300
Rym: but it bothers me too that even mmorpg the word RPG is useless to describe a game nowadays.

391
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:31,220
Scott: Well, I think that the term RPG, you know The everything that is called an RPG has the common ancestor of Dungeons & Dragons and its ancestors.

392
00:28:31,722 --> 00:28:37,780
Scott: But or you know Final Fantasy all these sorts right, but if you look something like Final Fantasy 12, what is Final Fantasy 12?

393
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:42,280
Scott: Well, it's a movie and you push buttons to see the next part of the movie and there's a little bit of exploring and such.

394
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,425
Rym: Yeah, we're not saying there's anything wrong with that but how is that?

395
00:28:45,485 --> 00:28:56,280
Rym: the same as burning wheel or as a role-playing game where you play a character and There's a lot of dialogue based decision-making and reactions and you play a role in a story?

396
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,145
Scott: Yeah, they're completely different things yet.

397
00:28:58,186 --> 00:28:59,870
Scott: You call them both RPGs.

398
00:29:00,131 --> 00:29:09,770
Scott: That's like, you know if I have a Piece of paper and I have a bomb like a bowling ball can I just thought is something weird?

399
00:29:10,071 --> 00:29:11,740
Scott: and then I call them both carrots.

400
00:29:12,181 --> 00:29:16,976
Rym: It's like if I have an analogy and I just take as crazy as I possibly can go.

401
00:29:16,996 --> 00:29:22,068
Scott: I have an analogy and I tried to make it silly.

402
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:27,910
Scott: But anyway, this this project dark star seems like it's pretty cool.

403
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:38,860
Scott: And I think it will encourage many people who you know Might otherwise veer away from developing MMO type games because of the difficulty in time and expense involved.

404
00:29:39,342 --> 00:29:43,175
Scott: Now pretty much all you have to do is you get this project dark star.

405
00:29:43,436 --> 00:29:50,780
Scott: you set your server up And then you can develop the client end of your game in sort of any platform you choose.

406
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:57,279
Scott: you know, you could take the unreal engine you could take the source engine, you know, whatever and You can make the client end.

407
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:01,835
Scott: So people you know who were formerly making like half-life mods or something.

408
00:30:02,377 --> 00:30:11,840
Scott: if they take this It won't take much more work or at least add the amount of work It would take otherwise to make say an MMO source mod.

409
00:30:12,482 --> 00:30:17,120
Scott: So we're gonna see a lot of I think quality MMO games coming out maybe if people recognize this project.

410
00:30:17,642 --> 00:30:22,887
Rym: So I guess I'll introduce what's about to happen because we came up with something We've a long time.

411
00:30:22,927 --> 00:30:25,080
Scott: We're gonna try this out do a little dueling new thing.

412
00:30:25,161 --> 00:30:34,640
Rym: We're gonna do this for four Mondays in a row and then we'll probably take a break from it go back to our usual fair and then we'll try to come Back to this and hopefully we'll build up some other Monday fair in.

413
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,760
Rym: You got some I got some but anyway, the idea here is that for a long time?

414
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:49,699
Rym: We've been avoiding certain topics largely because either myself or Scott are an expert on it or know a lot about it But the other of the two of us doesn't know so much about it.

415
00:30:50,021 --> 00:31:07,280
Scott: We've also been sort of avoiding these topics because we sort of always try to veer away from going too deep too technical and fear of scaring away some people who might not want to be so Technical, you know if I start talking about like the nitty-gritty of like different memory management algorithms

416
00:31:07,621 --> 00:31:12,279
Rym: Start explaining exactly what the OID take trees are in SNMP.

417
00:31:12,661 --> 00:31:15,048
Scott: Yeah, if I start, you know explaining, you know, why.

418
00:31:15,069 --> 00:31:21,410
Scott: you know the big O scheduler in the Linux kernel versus You know that the new scheduler is one is better than the other.

419
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:26,573
Rym: I start explaining the intricate details of why it sucks to Synchronize time and a virtualized machine.

420
00:31:26,633 --> 00:31:27,800
Scott: It's gonna be a snooze fest

421
00:31:28,061 --> 00:31:46,551
Rym: yes, but I think we realize is if we kind of get away from this fear of Going into topics where really only one of us has a lot to say and the other person is kind of the passive voice And if we alternate it between CS and IT effectively We can probably get some really interesting shows out of this.

422
00:31:46,993 --> 00:31:48,015
Scott: All right, we think we will.

423
00:31:48,316 --> 00:31:49,319
Scott: it's worth a try, right?

424
00:31:49,379 --> 00:31:52,005
Scott: It's It's it's a free show.

425
00:31:52,025 --> 00:31:52,587
Scott: We're making here.

426
00:31:52,628 --> 00:31:53,511
Scott: We can make it everyone's.

427
00:31:53,531 --> 00:31:54,837
Rym: we're pushing 500 episodes here.

428
00:31:55,701 --> 00:31:59,319
Scott: So I think we're running out of ideas Not terribly.

429
00:32:00,264 --> 00:32:03,420
Scott: We just came up with a bunch of new ideas and this is one of them.

430
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:16,700
Rym: so yeah but I think also the I the fact that I think we can keep this interesting because we're gonna get into a lot of kind of Real like awesome detail and deep depth, but at the same time or relatively deep depth not gonna go too deep.

431
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:28,565
Rym: I think we can keep it interesting especially because there will always be one of the two of us who is not 100% together with all of this and might ask the questions that you at home are thinking What about blah?

432
00:32:28,886 --> 00:32:31,295
Rym: Scott will say something about object-oriented something something.

433
00:32:31,335 --> 00:32:31,636
Rym: I'll go.

434
00:32:31,677 --> 00:32:32,279
Rym: was it was it?

435
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:33,681
Scott: All right.

436
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:35,789
Scott: So today we're gonna Scott's turn.

437
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:36,591
Scott: It's my turn.

438
00:32:36,651 --> 00:32:40,906
Scott: basically, you know, I realize I'm Programmed for a living.

439
00:32:41,107 --> 00:32:47,038
Scott: I've been programming computers technically Speaking since kindergarten when I was using logo, right?

440
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,593
Rym: Programming is always turn the turtle into a helicopter.

441
00:32:50,774 --> 00:32:55,088
Scott: Yeah, it's a good one, but Programming computers is pretty much how I do.

442
00:32:55,369 --> 00:32:56,432
Scott: That's how I make money is?

443
00:32:56,493 --> 00:32:57,175
Scott: it's how I live.

444
00:32:57,436 --> 00:33:04,039
Scott: I went to school for it And I've been taking classes on it for even longer than you know, I technically went to school for it.

445
00:33:04,661 --> 00:33:15,080
Scott: I've been doing it for mad long and I've done how many episodes of GeekNights and we've actually only done one show on Computer programming yet and it was how to get into computer programming.

446
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,918
Scott: I didn't even actually talk about programming itself or anything like that.

447
00:33:18,722 --> 00:33:30,177
Scott: So I figure what now I will do is I'm gonna do a show on what is programming because a lot of people are interested in it, but not many people really know.

448
00:33:30,278 --> 00:33:36,278
Scott: even people who are Programming don't really understand what they're doing, you know conceptually and for reals.

449
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:38,774
Rym: Yep I mean, it's kind of I'll say this cuz.

450
00:33:38,814 --> 00:33:51,333
Rym: I had a revelation Early on in my IT career when I was I was trying to learn some programming language to do some crap for a class Even this is back when I was working at IBM and I was still going to RIT and I was trying to program something.

451
00:33:51,353 --> 00:33:52,220
Rym: I'm making this program.

452
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:56,059
Rym: It's getting bigger and bigger and it's complicated and it's frustrating and I'm having trouble with it.

453
00:33:56,665 --> 00:34:05,458
Rym: and then I thought and Much like when I played initial D the arcade game and I was trying to drift and do all this fancy stuff and learn all The craziness and then I thought I was like, wait a minute.

454
00:34:06,223 --> 00:34:08,820
Rym: All I really want to do is get down the hill as fast as possible.

455
00:34:09,301 --> 00:34:09,984
Rym: Doesn't matter it.

456
00:34:10,485 --> 00:34:12,051
Rym: I'm trying to do something.

457
00:34:12,411 --> 00:34:13,435
Rym: Why don't I just do it?

458
00:34:13,797 --> 00:34:16,607
Rym: then I looked at my code I said why don't I just do it?

459
00:34:16,768 --> 00:34:18,414
Rym: and the end result is what I wanted?

460
00:34:18,454 --> 00:34:18,976
Rym: and I did it.

461
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:24,518
Rym: and then I learned a Lot more by thinking about what I wanted to get done as opposed to thinking about anything else.

462
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:31,360
Scott: Yep Alright, so before I start talking about what computer programming is I gotta talk about what a computer is.

463
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:35,879
Scott: We may have talked about this before but it bears repeating because we if we did talk about it before is only once.

464
00:34:36,018 --> 00:34:40,539
Rym: also I think Scott's going to talk about it in a in a way that will be very very I don't know.

465
00:34:40,942 --> 00:34:43,579
Scott: I like how we're met in this episode because it's such a test.

466
00:34:45,261 --> 00:34:48,710
Scott: Anyway, so Rym what do you think a computer is?

467
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:57,300
Scott: why a computer is a very complex machine that adds Are you purposefully giving the wrong answer or do you know the the right answer?

468
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,381
Rym: Let me get that.

469
00:34:58,401 --> 00:34:58,642
Rym: I was.

470
00:34:58,882 --> 00:35:08,026
Rym: is a very complex machine that the complexity exists solely to do a very simple thing Over and over again billions and billions of times.

471
00:35:08,547 --> 00:35:09,349
Scott: No, not really.

472
00:35:09,449 --> 00:35:10,972
Rym: Yeah, that simple thing is to add a.

473
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,746
Scott: That's not a computer.

474
00:35:15,806 --> 00:35:16,269
Scott: Okay.

475
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:18,320
Scott: Well, that could be a subset of computer.

476
00:35:18,802 --> 00:35:21,452
Scott: A computer is a device any device any.

477
00:35:21,894 --> 00:35:22,837
Scott: it could be mechanical.

478
00:35:22,877 --> 00:35:28,040
Scott: It could be electrical It could be anything into which you input some information.

479
00:35:28,221 --> 00:35:35,333
Scott: somehow the machine then Processes that information and has a deterministic output based on that input.

480
00:35:35,393 --> 00:35:36,617
Scott: that is what a computer for you.

481
00:35:36,637 --> 00:35:37,339
Rym: fancy-fancy think.

482
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,503
Rym: wait But what about a?

483
00:35:38,765 --> 00:35:42,400
Rym: no you're wrong because if you made it there was some initial input.

484
00:35:42,982 --> 00:35:47,300
Rym: Yeah, pretty much and if there's no output it effectively doesn't exist, yep.

485
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:53,000
Scott: So yeah, you could have a computer that say well an abacus is not a computer.

486
00:35:53,181 --> 00:35:56,293
Scott: An abacus is not a computer because there is no processing.

487
00:35:56,594 --> 00:35:58,763
Scott: the abacus that you know It doesn't you?

488
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:01,173
Scott: you input you move the little guys around right?

489
00:36:01,274 --> 00:36:02,519
Scott: I don't really actually know how to use an abacus.

490
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:06,331
Rym: I'm sorry and abacus is more like data storage for the brain that does the process.

491
00:36:06,371 --> 00:36:12,085
Scott: Yeah, it's like you move things around But it doesn't actually Process anything.

492
00:36:12,105 --> 00:36:12,908
Scott: there's no output.

493
00:36:12,989 --> 00:36:15,920
Scott: It's like you move a guy up and the rest of the guys are down.

494
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:17,131
Scott: Well, that's it.

495
00:36:17,232 --> 00:36:18,000
Scott: It's the end of the road.

496
00:36:18,161 --> 00:36:22,560
Rym: What about say a clockwork mechanism to calculate where the planets will be in the sky?

497
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,224
Scott: That is indeed a computer.

498
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:47,205
Scott: you would you would input the you know, the time and the date right of you know when you wanted to what you know time and date you wanted the stars to look like and then You would push a button or crank a lever or something and it would move the planets and stars around and it would show You the output where the planets and stars will be on the given date and time, you know an astrolabe That's.

499
00:36:47,326 --> 00:36:51,684
Scott: that is a computer I guess a Pocket calculator.

500
00:36:51,764 --> 00:36:52,968
Scott: That's a computer, right?

501
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,113
Rym: Oh my computer.

502
00:36:54,133 --> 00:36:56,946
Scott: Oh, yeah your computer your computer It's a computer.

503
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:58,960
Scott: right all these things are computers, right?

504
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:04,784
Scott: but many computers right are not Programmable computers.

505
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:12,193
Scott: for example, we just talked about a machine that would say, you know Do show you where these stars in the sky are.

506
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:13,639
Scott: or a pocket calculator, right?

507
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:20,640
Scott: Well a pocket calculator it does one thing it calculates, you know one plus one equals, right?

508
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,866
Scott: You can't change what it does.

509
00:37:22,886 --> 00:37:27,460
Scott: It is programmed already to do one thing and only one thing.

510
00:37:27,781 --> 00:37:32,040
Scott: You know, it might be do a complex thing like a pocket calculator or even a graphing calculator.

511
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,247
Scott: Of course many graphing calculators are programmable.

512
00:37:34,387 --> 00:37:39,183
Scott: So that's that's sort of a bad point, but a scientific calculator not very programmable Really?

513
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:40,011
Scott: No, not at all.

514
00:37:40,778 --> 00:37:46,260
Scott: So What is the difference between a programmable computer and a non programmable computer?

515
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,540
Scott: Well, let us consider say a light switch, right?

516
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:54,600
Scott: You could almost say that a light switch combined with a light is a computer.

517
00:37:54,962 --> 00:37:59,144
Scott: you have input switch up switch or switch up or down and Output.

518
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:00,732
Scott: the processing is just see.

519
00:38:00,772 --> 00:38:02,520
Scott: the thing is there's no processing in a light switch.

520
00:38:02,701 --> 00:38:06,259
Scott: It's just sort of direct, you know, which is what sort of rules it out.

521
00:38:06,882 --> 00:38:10,035
Scott: But let's say you had two switches that controlled one light.

522
00:38:10,376 --> 00:38:11,300
Scott: That would be a computer.

523
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:14,338
Scott: You know if you could be set to where you know.

524
00:38:14,881 --> 00:38:15,726
Scott: It's only odd.

525
00:38:15,786 --> 00:38:18,540
Scott: the light only turns on if both switches are up, right?

526
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,745
Scott: Okay, you hardwire that in.

527
00:38:20,785 --> 00:38:24,115
Scott: you can you connect electrical wires so that two switches are up.

528
00:38:24,175 --> 00:38:27,310
Scott: the light turns on any other configuration The light is not on.

529
00:38:27,874 --> 00:38:28,660
Scott: that's a computer.

530
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:35,140
Scott: There is a tiny amount of processing the figuring out if both switches are up or not and the output the light turning on, right?

531
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,640
Scott: But let's say you want to have a programmable light switch computer.

532
00:38:39,961 --> 00:38:47,220
Scott: well, and what you do is you add two more switches and What happens is those two switches?

533
00:38:48,000 --> 00:39:04,520
Scott: basically, you can have it set where if the two additional switches are both up that means the light will turn on if the Original two switches are both up and if the two additional switches are down Then the light will only turn on if the two additional switches are down.

534
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:11,940
Scott: You have more inputs additional inputs and those additional inputs change the nature of the processing.

535
00:39:12,362 --> 00:39:15,600
Scott: The processing can be modified with more input.

536
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:27,010
Scott: So you instead of just having input that is then processed and outputted you have input to modify the processing itself And then the input and then the output.

537
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:33,960
Scott: so you can have one machine that can actually Do different things because you can modify what it's doing.

538
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:42,370
Scott: You could say have a pocket calculator right and then modify it so that the plus button Actually is a minus button in the minus buttons a plus button.

539
00:39:42,831 --> 00:39:45,740
Scott: You just changed the processing in the calculator.

540
00:39:46,382 --> 00:39:52,080
Scott: Yet, it's still a computer and it's still computing but it's programmable because you can change what it does.

541
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:56,672
Scott: Now Let me go a little deeper into how we do this.

542
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:58,780
Scott: go deeper go deeper, right?

543
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,400
Scott: So you have your Pentium chips right now, how does the Pentium chips work?

544
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:09,359
Scott: Well, the Pentium chip understands instructions, right such as you could tell it to add.

545
00:40:10,621 --> 00:40:13,880
Scott: You know inside of the chip is a very small amount of memory and registers.

546
00:40:14,021 --> 00:40:15,933
Scott: But don't worry about I'm just gonna say registers.

547
00:40:16,034 --> 00:40:18,319
Scott: if that bothers you It's just memory in the chip.

548
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:34,460
Scott: You could tell it to say take the data in register 1 and add it to register 2. right you could tell it to erase register 2. you could tell it to Look at the number in register 1 and that number is an address in the RAM.

549
00:40:35,022 --> 00:40:40,363
Scott: Go to the RAM and get the data at that address and put it in register 3. you know you.

550
00:40:40,584 --> 00:40:47,348
Scott: these are the kinds of instructions you can give to the chip and The way you give it these instructions is binary.

551
00:40:47,809 --> 00:41:01,083
Scott: it for example the instruction to you know move Some data from one place to another right is actually, you know is like the move instruction is zero zero one zero one One zero one zero one.

552
00:41:01,103 --> 00:41:06,640
Scott: I just made something up, but that binary string that number is the instruction.

553
00:41:06,801 --> 00:41:17,706
Scott: So you input that number and the chip goes aha That number is the move instruction and then you tell it the next number that comes in and it goes aha that is what I am moving from.

554
00:41:17,747 --> 00:41:24,271
Scott: and then the next number that comes in it goes aha, that's where I'm moving to and That's how you these chips work.

555
00:41:24,472 --> 00:41:25,620
Scott: is there either?

556
00:41:26,343 --> 00:41:28,430
Scott: You turn the chip over and there's all these pins.

557
00:41:28,812 --> 00:41:31,080
Scott: right those pins take zeros and ones.

558
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:36,520
Scott: That's all they can go on those pins electricity or not electricity and the instructions are all you know.

559
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,617
Scott: If you have a 32-bit processor these instructions are 32 bits long.

560
00:41:40,463 --> 00:41:44,443
Scott: You can have a lot of instructions because you can have 2 to the 32nd power.

561
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:45,926
Scott: different instructions you can have.

562
00:41:46,147 --> 00:41:52,339
Scott: they don't have that many, but you could and These instructions are what we call the assembly language.

563
00:41:52,863 --> 00:41:53,709
Scott: That is what you know.

564
00:41:53,749 --> 00:41:59,576
Scott: people talk about assembly all the time And how it's so hard machine machine code because it's the code of the machine.

565
00:41:59,636 --> 00:42:02,740
Scott: you're literally Talking to the processor.

566
00:42:03,003 --> 00:42:14,919
Scott: It's as if the processor had 32 levers and you were putting the levers up and down and then pushing a button to send that into the processor and then Changing all the levers and then pushing another pushing the button again.

567
00:42:15,561 --> 00:42:31,475
Scott: You're literally sending zeros and ones directly into the CPU and because of the way if you understand how the CPU is made There are books and you know any CPU you get that's programmable has a giant book that tells you everything it can do and all The instructions and how it works and what's inside.

568
00:42:31,495 --> 00:42:32,199
Scott: all right?

569
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:38,020
Scott: You are directly controlling the CPU with zeros and ones now obviously writing any sort of large.

570
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:41,943
Rym: I mean imagine trying to write half-life 2 in Assembly code.

571
00:42:42,204 --> 00:42:46,980
Rym: try to break that game down to move this bit here move this bit there move this byte here.

572
00:42:47,462 --> 00:42:49,233
Scott: Yeah, that's not gonna be fun.

573
00:42:49,273 --> 00:42:52,224
Scott: That's that's pretty much The definition of pain.

574
00:42:52,705 --> 00:42:56,374
Scott: I mean people have written some pretty impressive programs in assembly language.

575
00:42:56,495 --> 00:43:03,474
Scott: usually you know old in the olden days Before we had you know more advanced technology and also for very small devices.

576
00:43:03,695 --> 00:43:17,074
Scott: We're writing in assembly is pretty much Necessary because when you write in assembly language the advantage is that you can optimize the code with your human brain To run very quickly on that machine and to take up very little memory.

577
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:39,239
Scott: so your iPod You know if someone writes the iPod operating system in assembly language that operating system will end up being much smaller and much faster Making the iPod cheaper because you have you need less storage space to hold the operating system so they can give you less flash memory you know and say make the device cheaper and Also, it'll be faster.

578
00:43:39,842 --> 00:43:43,514
Scott: The problem is it'll be much harder to make so they'll have to pay the developers more money.

579
00:43:43,615 --> 00:43:46,720
Scott: and not many people know how to Write assembly language anymore.

580
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,475
Scott: It's it's a pretty rare skill and every different kind of chip has a different language.

581
00:43:51,555 --> 00:43:52,980
Scott: so knowing how to write.

582
00:43:53,301 --> 00:43:56,435
Scott: You know assembly language for one chip doesn't mean you know how to do it for another.

583
00:43:56,455 --> 00:43:59,271
Scott: you usually have to read the book to Learn the new chip and such.

584
00:43:59,956 --> 00:44:02,323
Scott: but anyway So that is.

585
00:44:02,403 --> 00:44:05,194
Scott: that is how programming chips works.

586
00:44:05,254 --> 00:44:12,560
Scott: you you give instructions To the chips that tell them how to process and then you give the input.

587
00:44:12,961 --> 00:44:18,280
Scott: Which is more it you know following the instructions of how to process and then the chips do the output right?

588
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,620
Scott: But assembly language is not fun, so we have programming languages.

589
00:44:23,821 --> 00:44:26,334
Scott: This is where for even for me a long time.

590
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:27,360
Scott: It was a complete mystery.

591
00:44:27,842 --> 00:44:33,100
Scott: You know it's sort of like how do you get from programming language like something like Visual Basic right?

592
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,206
Scott: Down to the assembly language.

593
00:44:35,226 --> 00:44:38,700
Scott: in the zeros and ones it seems like there's like this big fuzzy gap.

594
00:44:38,841 --> 00:44:41,440
Scott: They're like huh, how did we get from here to there?

595
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,820
Scott: How do you get from windows popping up on the screen to assembly language?

596
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:55,695
Rym: It's like you know to the electricity zooming around on the motherboard especially as a kid when I mean I was writing stuff in Q-basic, and I couldn't fathom writing something before.

597
00:44:55,715 --> 00:44:57,200
Rym: you know I knew about a lot more computing.

598
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,872
Rym: I couldn't fathom writing like windows in that.

599
00:45:00,892 --> 00:45:03,320
Rym: and then I thought how do I leave and load windows?

600
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,528
Rym: What's windows running?

601
00:45:05,154 --> 00:45:05,760
Scott: Ah it's eat?

602
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:14,414
Scott: There's this big gap between the software world right which is which is all the the Instructions just in binary that you're gonna send to the CPU.

603
00:45:14,434 --> 00:45:17,287
Scott: That's all software is it's Instructions to send the CPU.

604
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:18,612
Scott: you know zeros and ones.

605
00:45:18,954 --> 00:45:33,580
Scott: you know conceptual zeros and ones they don't have to be real zeros and ones and the physical silicon in the chip that is going to take electricity into it and then Change the way it processes and then take more electricity into it and then actually process.

606
00:45:34,142 --> 00:45:36,371
Scott: There's this big hole and how does that hole get filled?

607
00:45:36,411 --> 00:45:38,660
Scott: well is how that hole gets filled right?

608
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:41,868
Scott: You have a thing that is called a compiler.

609
00:45:42,189 --> 00:45:45,780
Scott: There's an alternative which is an interpreter, but I'll explain that as the all soon.

610
00:45:46,627 --> 00:45:51,327
Scott: what a compiler does is It basically takes some.

611
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:53,453
Scott: it's a program itself right.

612
00:45:53,513 --> 00:46:04,718
Scott: that is you have a. you have a program already running on a CPU right and that program tells the CPU right to process input in a certain way.

613
00:46:04,738 --> 00:46:12,940
Scott: and What it does is it basically tells the CPU take this input and then output another program.

614
00:46:14,022 --> 00:46:15,249
Scott: Think about that for a second.

615
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:20,971
Scott: you program the CPU To output a program based on some input.

616
00:46:21,592 --> 00:46:24,380
Scott: That is a program itself could understand.

617
00:46:25,223 --> 00:46:28,213
Scott: so a simple idea to try to get this across.

618
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:29,719
Scott: so you know what the hell I'm talking about.

619
00:46:29,739 --> 00:46:31,697
Scott: I Could tell the CPU.

620
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:40,596
Scott: Okay, here are some instructions read from the memory in location number one in the RAM.

621
00:46:40,616 --> 00:46:44,548
Scott: and Then you know make it equal to.

622
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:50,573
Scott: you know I don't know number 32 and then output that back into the RAM.

623
00:46:51,216 --> 00:46:56,140
Scott: and then The next thing you should do the next instruction that you should interpret.

624
00:46:56,381 --> 00:46:56,803
Scott: You know the.

625
00:46:57,004 --> 00:47:11,674
Scott: you know because you when a computer is going at least a modern PC generally the way it works is there's a counter and that counter is a place in the RAM and it looks at that place in the RAM and That is where the next instruction is.

626
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:18,140
Scott: so Basically in the RAM you would have lined up see I starting with no address number one.

627
00:47:18,562 --> 00:47:21,799
Scott: It's like if a guy's what I'm trying to explain this because it's really hard without a picture.

628
00:47:22,781 --> 00:47:28,560
Scott: Okay, so you're walking down the street and every square on the sidewalk has a piece of paper on it, right?

629
00:47:29,441 --> 00:47:32,375
Scott: And that piece of paper says do this and then you walk.

630
00:47:32,476 --> 00:47:38,220
Scott: after you do that You go to the next square on the sidewalk and you pick up the piece of paper and you do what it says, okay?

631
00:47:39,261 --> 00:47:43,613
Scott: So the RAM is the sidewalk and what's in the RAM are those pieces of paper.

632
00:47:43,834 --> 00:47:47,079
Scott: and the CPU walks down the street doing What all the pieces of paper say?

633
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,859
Scott: What if one of the pieces of paper said?

634
00:47:51,021 --> 00:47:55,407
Scott: Skip over the next two pieces of paper That's that's that happens.

635
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:57,959
Scott: What if one of the pieces of paper said?

636
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,600
Scott: Erase the next piece of paper in front of you and write this on it instead?

637
00:48:03,661 --> 00:48:04,844
Scott: That is what we're talking about.

638
00:48:04,904 --> 00:48:06,207
Scott: here is a program.

639
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:14,170
Scott: it tells the CPU to write a program for itself and That is how programming languages work.

640
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:15,840
Scott: You have something like C, right?

641
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:21,706
Scott: You write in C, which is if you look at go look at some C code online You can find plenty of examples.

642
00:48:21,767 --> 00:48:28,399
Scott: if you just search for like hello world in C or something like that You'll find plenty of examples of what C code looks like if you've never seen it.

643
00:48:29,102 --> 00:48:44,506
Scott: And there's a program called the C compiler and the C compiler is a program and the Input to that program is C code and the output of that program, you know with the CPU outputs is Assembly language it takes in.

644
00:48:44,526 --> 00:48:49,799
Scott: you know text, you know the letter A letter B letter C in binary form.

645
00:48:49,819 --> 00:48:52,694
Scott: it processes them the way the.

646
00:48:52,875 --> 00:49:02,887
Scott: you know, the Compiler program has told the CPU to process and the output of that program is A bunch of assembly language instructions.

647
00:49:03,087 --> 00:49:13,900
Scott: and if you were to feed those assembly language instructions back to the CPU it would Reprogram the CPU to now do what the program you wrote in C told it to do.

648
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,353
Scott: So if you write hello world the compiler right takes your hello world.

649
00:49:18,394 --> 00:49:20,420
Scott: the word hello world you typed into notepad.

650
00:49:21,422 --> 00:49:30,520
Scott: It sends it the CPU the CPU then outputs a bunch of instructions And then it walks down the street that it just wrote all the pieces of paper on the street.

651
00:49:30,982 --> 00:49:35,626
Scott: Then it went back to the beginning and starts doing what those pieces of paper It just wrote say.

652
00:49:36,048 --> 00:49:46,888
Scott: and it says write the letter H write the letter E. so it's like if you went to your refrigerator and you wrote down get eggs and Then later you went to the refrigerator.

653
00:49:46,908 --> 00:49:49,799
Scott: You took the note off and it said get eggs and you got the eggs.

654
00:49:50,723 --> 00:49:52,773
Scott: only it's a lot simpler to you know, the.

655
00:49:52,914 --> 00:50:01,240
Scott: the difference is is That the sort of the human level of writing C code is much easier than writing the assembly code.

656
00:50:01,701 --> 00:50:08,260
Scott: So it's like it's translating for itself in a way if that makes sense and this is what?

657
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,028
Scott: computer programming is.

658
00:50:10,089 --> 00:50:19,924
Scott: computer programming is writing Instructions in sort of the higher level language, but also the lower level language, you know but in a language.

659
00:50:20,647 --> 00:50:29,300
Scott: and then if you're not writing in assembly language a Another program that you could even program those programs it gets that crazy.

660
00:50:30,003 --> 00:50:34,480
Rym: So I guess at this point where you gonna go with this the week after next where you gonna continue?

661
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:44,500
Scott: I'm gonna go over probably a bunch of different programming languages You know like and talk about the differences between them and which ones are useful for what because that's that's more of a real-world problem.

662
00:50:44,701 --> 00:50:45,864
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

663
00:50:46,125 --> 00:51:13,000
Scott: one last thing I want to mention in this episode though is that you know compiling is one way but there's also interpreting and the way interpreting works is basically when you compile a program the way that works is you walk down and you give the program to the compiler and It writes all the pieces of paper on the sidewalk all of them and then it goes back to the beginning and then it does What all of them say with an interpreter?

664
00:51:13,081 --> 00:51:14,940
Scott: It does it one at a time.

665
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:21,578
Scott: so it take it rewrites one piece of paper does what it says then writes the next piece of paper and does what it says.

666
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:31,571
Scott: and it's sort of it does things one at a time as it goes through and compiling and Interpreting both have advantages and disadvantages and and such.

667
00:51:31,871 --> 00:51:36,418
Scott: but there are the two different ways of sort of that programming languages do.

668
00:51:37,742 --> 00:51:39,348
Scott: But yeah, I wonder if that made sense.

669
00:51:39,408 --> 00:51:40,673
Scott: Tell me if that made sense people.

670
00:51:40,793 --> 00:51:41,556
Rym: Yeah, we'll find out.

671
00:51:41,717 --> 00:51:42,319
Scott: we'll find out.

672
00:51:44,144 --> 00:51:46,940
Rym: It made sense to me, but I'm an IT professional.

673
00:51:47,482 --> 00:51:49,267
Rym: Yeah, yeah, so we'll see.

674
00:51:49,829 --> 00:51:58,520
Rym: but speaking of IT professional where I'm gonna pick up next week is you know A lot of people use the word IT and a lot of people don't really know exactly what an IT department is.

675
00:51:58,641 --> 00:51:59,425
Rym: I say a lot of people.

676
00:51:59,465 --> 00:52:00,732
Rym: I mean a lot of companies too.

677
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,220
Scott: Yeah, mostly companies.

678
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:11,436
Rym: I'm pretty much gonna explain in in all the detail you'll ever want what IT actually is what IT departments actually do and I think it'll be pretty interesting.

679
00:52:11,517 --> 00:52:17,727
Scott: actually Yeah, a lot of people are like IT is just you know, the helpdesk or IT is a. you know Those server admin gas.

680
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:20,036
Rym: IT is both more and less than all of that.

681
00:52:20,277 --> 00:52:20,900
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

682
00:52:21,701 --> 00:52:24,409
Scott: But yeah programming it's telling dinner.

683
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:28,260
Scott: Yeah, it's telling the CPU how to process.

684
00:52:34,801 --> 00:52:37,391
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

685
00:52:37,411 --> 00:52:39,540
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music.

687
00:52:52,027 --> 00:52:57,746
Rym: we say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different Brands of geekery.

688
00:52:58,229 --> 00:53:02,359
Rym: Mondays are science and technology Tuesdays We have video games board games and RPGs.

689
00:53:02,902 --> 00:53:08,320
Rym: Wednesdays are anime manga comic nights and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

690
00:53:08,761 --> 00:53:20,440
