1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,137
Rym: It's Monday, October 28th, 2019.

2
00:00:10,137 --> 00:00:12,545
Rym: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights Tonight.

3
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,748
Rym: Microphones, like the things we're talking into right now.

4
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:20,139
Rym: Podcasts.

5
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:22,088
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,165
Scott: All right, so my new apartment.

7
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:28,631
Scott: Oh, yeah, new apartment.

8
00:00:28,671 --> 00:00:32,223
Scott: Directly across the street from high school.

9
00:00:32,442 --> 00:00:33,005
Scott: That's exciting.

10
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:34,550
Rym: You can see high school sports.

11
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,436
Scott: I can see a lot of free high school sports.

12
00:00:36,456 --> 00:00:37,600
Scott: High school marching bands.

13
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,967
Scott: It's not really a marching band.

14
00:00:39,209 --> 00:00:41,180
Rym: I mean, marching bands are really more of a Midwest thing.

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,768
Scott: There is a tiny amount of band.

16
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:44,840
Scott: I heard some toot-toot during a football game.

17
00:00:46,462 --> 00:00:48,833
Scott: But yeah, there was a big crowd.

18
00:00:48,853 --> 00:00:50,360
Scott: They closed the road over the weekend.

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,565
Rym: Oh, right.

20
00:00:51,826 --> 00:00:54,740
Scott: And I was, and there's mobs of people out there occasionally.

21
00:00:54,861 --> 00:00:56,578
Scott: And it took a while to figure out what the hell was going on.

22
00:00:57,221 --> 00:01:00,856
Scott: So what the hell was going on is this thing that no one outside of New York City will know about.

23
00:01:01,017 --> 00:01:02,626
Rym: I barely knew about it because I don't have kids.

24
00:01:02,807 --> 00:01:03,290
Scott: I know about it.

25
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:04,035
Scott: It's called the SH.

26
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:05,409
Scott: SAT.

27
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,500
Scott: Basically now relation to the real SAT, and other than that it is a standardized test.

28
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:11,122
Scott: Yep.

29
00:01:11,142 --> 00:01:18,216
Scott: And what the deal is is New York City, right, you know elementary school, middle school, you sort of go to the ones near you based on where you live.

30
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:22,180
Scott: Yeah, at least if you go into a public one.

31
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,503
Rym: People who don't live in New York, like the way it works is if you live in a town, the town has a school, there's a school district.

32
00:01:27,905 --> 00:01:31,015
Rym: In a big town, the town and the school district are the same.

33
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:34,639
Rym: In a really big town, there'll be like multiple school districts within the town.

34
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,060
Rym: Yeah.

35
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,044
Rym: It's all based on like population.

36
00:01:36,085 --> 00:01:39,740
Scott: But anyway, New York City works differently because it's obviously a special-edge case, right?

37
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:43,164
Scott: But the point is for high school, you got to take this fucking test.

38
00:01:43,646 --> 00:02:05,980
Scott: And the test is the literally the only criteria used, that way they can say it's a meritocracy, in determining who gets to go to these special New York high schools, right, like Stuyvesant and whatever, like these special high schools that are like better and fancier, at least, you know, and according to some people, they're more prestigious and whatever.

39
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:13,200
Scott: And yet somehow the, you know, the ethnic diversity of these schools ends up not being so even anyway.

40
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,119
Rym: Yup, somehow.

41
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,259
Scott: There's a lot of issues they're not going to go into.

42
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:16,551
Rym: Yeah.

43
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:28,720
Scott: But what was shocking to me is A, B, why is there this mob of people in the street and a street closing for standardized tests?

44
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:35,060
Rym: That's what I don't get, because like I took a lot of those kinds of standardized tests and like there was there was hullabaloo, but it was always like in a building somewhere.

45
00:02:35,403 --> 00:02:37,360
Rym: Why aren't these parents like sitting in the gym or something?

46
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,560
Scott: They only administer this test apparently at like a handful of locations around the city.

47
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,200
Rym: Oh, that's fair.

48
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,180
Scott: So people came from all the fuck over.

49
00:02:44,702 --> 00:02:45,900
Rym: That sounds totally fair.

50
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,700
Scott: Why not administer the thing at like every high school?

51
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,338
Scott: Well, like, look.

52
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:50,378
Scott: Every high school.

53
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,660
Rym: Here's another SAT, the PSAT, every middle school and high school just administers it.

54
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:57,667
Scott: Our middle, our high school had every.

55
00:02:57,747 --> 00:02:58,952
Scott: it's like everyone.

56
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,240
Scott: isn't every high school in the city administering the test.

57
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,479
Scott: Why do people have to travel?

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,207
Scott: Maybe that's maybe that is, you know, contributing to this problem.

59
00:03:07,347 --> 00:03:13,958
Scott: is that, hey, poor people can't afford to take a weekend to travel to some high school far away.

60
00:03:13,998 --> 00:03:15,100
Scott: with the test being administered.

61
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:17,239
Scott: Maybe if you offered it to every single high school.

62
00:03:17,702 --> 00:03:19,499
Rym: Well, let's back up every single school period.

63
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,580
Rym: The real problem is that for you non-American listeners, this might explain a lot about us as a country.

64
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:34,740
Rym: For various, mostly racist reasons, schools are funded from the local tax base and there are federal things involved.

65
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,120
Rym: But basically, if you live in a richer town, your schools just have more money.

66
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:46,820
Rym: And if you live in a poorer town, your schools just have less money because they base it almost exclusively on property taxes.

67
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:49,140
Rym: And that is a fucking problem.

68
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:55,780
Rym: But in New York, it's extra special because everyone lives so close together and most people rent that they have to like figure out where to send kids.

69
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,360
Rym: Like you can't send every kid to the school that's closest to them.

70
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,020
Scott: You'll also have like buildings that have several schools in them.

71
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,068
Scott: You'll have people scamming where they like.

72
00:04:03,088 --> 00:04:05,800
Scott: they find a nape because you're not too far away from a different school.

73
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,739
Rym: When I was a kid in the suburbs, people did that.

74
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,159
Rym: Like there was a dividing line.

75
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:09,701
Scott: Right.

76
00:04:09,722 --> 00:04:10,919
Scott: But you think it's bad in the suburb.

77
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,960
Scott: It's way bad in New York City.

78
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:20,899
Rym: There was a street in Southeast Michigan near Anchor Bay where literally if you lived on one side of the street, you went to a really good school.

79
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:26,240
Rym: If you lived on the other side of that street, like in this subdivision, you went to a really shitty school.

80
00:04:26,864 --> 00:04:28,139
Rym: And there was just no way around that.

81
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,220
Scott: Literally, the house I grew up in was in Trumbull, Connecticut.

82
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:31,661
Scott: Right.

83
00:04:31,701 --> 00:04:39,320
Scott: Which was a somewhat wealthy, you know, affluent, suburb town with, you know, quality schools, according to people, I guess.

84
00:04:40,283 --> 00:04:42,740
Scott: Literally, the other side of the street was Bridgeport, Connecticut.

85
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:52,020
Scott: The kids who lived on the other side of the street had to go to Bridgeport High School, which is like the worst high school in like, you know, poor urban Bridgeport.

86
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:59,120
Rym: Now, sometimes they were like where I grew up when I went to high school, we were in Sterling Heights, which basically had a school district for its area.

87
00:04:59,662 --> 00:05:01,739
Rym: And it had four high schools that are all equally good.

88
00:05:02,062 --> 00:05:04,360
Rym: As long as you're in that school district, all the schools were great.

89
00:05:05,361 --> 00:05:09,340
Scott: Anyway, point is, they only administered it in a handful of places.

90
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,419
Scott: What the fuck is up with that?

91
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:10,900
Rym: Yeah.

92
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:13,889
Scott: And of course, as you were just saying, why?

93
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:17,720
Scott: the fundamental problem is, why are some high schools shouldn't even be better than others?

94
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,560
Scott: Why can't all high schools in New York City be equally good?

95
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:29,300
Rym: Well, what I couldn't have to care which one you go to, what I could make an argument for is there should be a series of specialized high schools.

96
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:36,060
Rym: They shouldn't be better, but they should be focused on a particular need, like a certain kind of special education or a certain kind of advanced program.

97
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:42,520
Rym: But then there should be a fair way to make sure the kids who need that special education get to go to that specialized school.

98
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,540
Rym: Well, I think you can't put that level of specialization in every high school.

99
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:54,360
Scott: No, but I think, you know, what you should do if you are going to say right that, you know, some people are special and need a special thing.

100
00:05:54,841 --> 00:05:58,160
Scott: It's like, well, OK, the way they do it now, it's like, well, here's this high school.

101
00:05:58,281 --> 00:05:59,878
Scott: It accepts this many people every year.

102
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,280
Scott: And it's like, well, what if the number of special people?

103
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,900
Rym: The rule should be everyone who meets the criteria for special education, literally everyone who meets it.

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,201
Scott: Right.

105
00:06:07,261 --> 00:06:13,940
Scott: If you it's like, no, no, no, none of this bullshit where you need a test and you have enough seats is literally all these kids got straight A's.

106
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,803
Scott: They're all geniuses.

107
00:06:14,964 --> 00:06:18,760
Scott: Then they all go to equally awesome special high school.

108
00:06:19,263 --> 00:06:20,679
Scott: No limit on number of seats.

109
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,407
Scott: Bullshit.

110
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:21,652
Rym: Yeah.

111
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:21,836
Rym: Right.

112
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,540
Rym: Now, take this on the national level.

113
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:39,460
Rym: Like I could do to make sense where, like, if your kid is like a super genius or has a very specific type of learning disability that needs specialized help and you live in like dirtbag Pennsylvania where there's only 40 kids in the high school, then the government should make sure that your kid gets to go to a kind of school wherever it is in the country.

114
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,620
Scott: Well, I mean, there's too many issues going on.

115
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:41,882
Scott: Right.

116
00:06:41,922 --> 00:06:43,920
Scott: Like the kid who is a genius, but is poor.

117
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:53,380
Rym: So, you know, when I recognize some specific like I went through this as a kid, my parents like threatened to sue the school because there's a Michigan law that basically said if a kid needs special education.

118
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:54,960
Rym: And the district can't provide it.

119
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,520
Rym: The district has to provide it via alternative means.

120
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:58,801
Scott: Right.

121
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:00,680
Scott: But how many kids, you know, they're poor.

122
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,039
Scott: And maybe if that kid had been rich, they'd be genius, too.

123
00:07:04,402 --> 00:07:05,498
Scott: But they weren't.

124
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:05,943
Rym: Yeah.

125
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:06,559
Scott: It's like, come on.

126
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,699
Scott: You know, now that kid can't pass this test.

127
00:07:09,064 --> 00:07:10,020
Scott: Not because they couldn't.

128
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,579
Scott: They could have if they had been born wealthy.

129
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:19,500
Rym: There were probably a lot of kids in my middle school that qualified to be like this gifted kid thing, but the school district basically didn't want to deal with that.

130
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:27,540
Rym: So instead, they just sent a bus to pick me and only me up every day to take me to the high school to take high school classes and then back to the middle school to take my required middle school classes.

131
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,960
Scott: Not everyone has parents who will fight and spend money.

132
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:30,364
Scott: Yeah.

133
00:07:30,385 --> 00:07:31,420
Rym: They didn't spend any money.

134
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,220
Rym: We didn't actually sue.

135
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:45,760
Scott: Not everyone has parents who will send them the special, you know, training classes for this this one test you have to take and wait outside the school in the rain to get you when you finish the test to bring you back home to a far away where you live.

136
00:07:46,061 --> 00:07:50,040
Rym: Also, one of your kids is just like sick that day and does shit on the test because they're sick.

137
00:07:50,380 --> 00:08:00,300
Scott: Well, it seemed it seemed like the test was going both days and I don't know anything about how the test is actually structured, but it felt like there was based on the flow of people.

138
00:08:00,843 --> 00:08:02,999
Scott: It seemed like there were several sessions per day.

139
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:07,240
Scott: So I don't know if you had to sign up or you just show up for one of the sessions on either day.

140
00:08:07,402 --> 00:08:08,218
Scott: So you got two days.

141
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,460
Scott: You got probably plenty of advance notice.

142
00:08:10,921 --> 00:08:12,699
Scott: You know, you got a handful of locations.

143
00:08:13,642 --> 00:08:16,120
Rym: Apparently, they do have a little tiny bit of accountability.

144
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:24,880
Rym: You parents can get a copy of the kids answer sheet and the questions and like they can like review it and make sure, like the questions weren't wrong or something.

145
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,460
Rym: There's there's some good things here, but there's a lot of bad.

146
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,061
Scott: Yeah.

147
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:30,340
Scott: Anyway, schools are weird.

148
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:34,020
Scott: The street outside my house was like a shit show all weekend.

149
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:42,740
Scott: And then it was crazy rain on like a mad rain on Sunday, which was kind of, you know, it was like a big umbrella sea of all these parents.

150
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,560
Scott: And other people just loitering in the closed street, waiting for kids to finish a test.

151
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,279
Scott: And at one point, people like kids came out and there was like clapping.

152
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,320
Scott: But wow, that culture.

153
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:52,926
Scott: That's bad.

154
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:53,860
Scott: But here's what I don't understand.

155
00:08:54,061 --> 00:08:54,840
Rym: This is a high school.

156
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,340
Rym: This is a test to get into high schools.

157
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:56,620
Rym: Right.

158
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:56,982
Scott: Yep.

159
00:08:57,684 --> 00:09:02,780
Rym: Kids who are at the end of middle school should already just like why does the kid just take the subway to this thing, take the test and go home?

160
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,630
Rym: Like why are the parents there?

161
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:04,380
Scott: Where does the kid live?

162
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,859
Scott: I might not live in a subway place and take the bus.

163
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:09,382
Scott: Yeah.

164
00:09:09,422 --> 00:09:12,920
Scott: You might be bad parents who don't let your kids roam around and go all the way.

165
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:22,180
Rym: I mean, at least when I had to take I took entrance exams to go to some private schools and I didn't go to any of them, partly because we couldn't afford, even though I passed the test, couldn't afford to go to those schools.

166
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:23,780
Rym: But I couldn't drive.

167
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,608
Rym: I was like 14.

168
00:09:24,608 --> 00:09:25,700
Rym: Some parents had to drive me to these.

169
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,900
Scott: Anyway, so, you know, this, you know, I, you know, purposefully don't have children's going to deal with this bullshit.

170
00:09:31,181 --> 00:09:32,519
Scott: Just comment on it from afar.

171
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:37,999
Scott: I feel bad for the people who did choose to have children who have to deal with the shit and didn't realize that.

172
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,400
Rym: Well, I remember when my, when we moved, like as a kid, like we'd move a few times, like we just moved houses.

173
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,800
Rym: Every time we move, my parents spend a shitload of time, like researching the school districts, like, oh, this house looks good.

174
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:55,220
Rym: And then they'd spend like a week trying to figure out if the schools that that house is associated with are good or not.

175
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:59,700
Rym: And there were a lot of really good houses we couldn't buy because they were in really bad schools.

176
00:10:00,061 --> 00:10:06,280
Rym: And that seems like a weird thing to have to worry about, especially in, you know, arguably the richest, best country in the world.

177
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:06,743
Rym: Maybe.

178
00:10:06,803 --> 00:10:09,579
Scott: Yeah, outside my house.

179
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:10,827
Scott: It was bad times.

180
00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:12,378
Scott: Yeah, I guess that'll happen every year.

181
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,600
Rym: So there's a whole bunch of news going on.

182
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,460
Rym: And the first thing I want to talk about is this feature that Netflix is reportedly testing.

183
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:20,061
Scott: Right.

184
00:10:20,122 --> 00:10:25,580
Scott: So if you have a podcast reader, a feature I know a lot of people haven't used is make it sound like GeekNights.

185
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,169
Scott: Also, people do this with audiobooks.

186
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,900
Scott: also is the speed up feature.

187
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,221
Scott: Right.

188
00:10:31,241 --> 00:10:36,960
Scott: So I can understand that feature, especially for like an informational, like daily news podcast or something.

189
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,260
Rym: If you care about the content, not the execution.

190
00:10:39,381 --> 00:10:39,543
Scott: Right.

191
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:40,880
Scott: You speed up that podcast.

192
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:49,260
Scott: So that way you it takes less time to ingest more information, because really, in terms of information density per time spent, nothing beats text.

193
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:49,702
Scott: Right.

194
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:50,105
Scott: Right.

195
00:10:50,206 --> 00:10:52,400
Scott: Everyone keeps producing audio and video content.

196
00:10:52,782 --> 00:10:55,360
Scott: If you're just interested in the information only.

197
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:55,984
Scott: Right.

198
00:10:56,004 --> 00:11:00,920
Scott: Like I'm watching YouTube video like how to do X. I want it to go as fast as possible.

199
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,300
Scott: I'd rather have an article.

200
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,260
Scott: I'm watching the video because maybe the imagery will help me because it's like a crafting or something.

201
00:11:07,744 --> 00:11:08,414
Scott: You get the idea.

202
00:11:08,557 --> 00:11:08,719
Rym: Yeah.

203
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,599
Rym: Well, I guess I want text.

204
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,980
Rym: I keep finding videos unless there's a technique that I don't know what I want to watch.

205
00:11:14,685 --> 00:11:15,090
Scott: Exactly.

206
00:11:15,251 --> 00:11:15,676
Scott: Perfect.

207
00:11:15,737 --> 00:11:15,959
Scott: Right.

208
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:18,720
Scott: But speeding up can help there when you want content.

209
00:11:18,941 --> 00:11:19,182
Scott: Right.

210
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:21,840
Scott: But, you know, for audiobooks.

211
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:22,862
Scott: Right.

212
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:27,518
Scott: You know, I guess it kind of makes sense to speed it up because there's two kinds of two aspects.

213
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,157
Scott: The next of the audiobook.

214
00:11:29,218 --> 00:11:29,340
Scott: Right.

215
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:36,680
Scott: And the one aspect, it's like, well, I'm using this audiobook because I can't, won't or otherwise have a reason not to read.

216
00:11:39,384 --> 00:11:39,545
Scott: Right.

217
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,180
Scott: And, you know, I'm really just trying to get the words from the book.

218
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:48,080
Scott: So the image I'm painting in my head, I just need the words to deliver the words to me, which I would have gotten if I read the book.

219
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,140
Scott: But some of the image in my head, just as I would have if I was reading the book.

220
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:57,020
Rym: But some audiobooks are almost like a treatment where like it has like good acting.

221
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,324
Rym: Right.

222
00:11:57,507 --> 00:11:58,420
Rym: Like it's a story.

223
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:05,840
Scott: If you want to speed up an audiobook where there are like voices and acting and stuff and you speed that up, you are destroying that.

224
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,261
Scott: Yeah.

225
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:13,840
Rym: Which is, you know, you're basically doing the equivalent of instead of watching a TV show, literally just reading the script to that TV show.

226
00:12:13,981 --> 00:12:14,489
Scott: Exactly.

227
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:15,260
Rym: That's what you're doing.

228
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:15,620
Scott: Right.

229
00:12:15,661 --> 00:12:16,022
Scott: Perfect.

230
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:22,460
Scott: So Netflix is adding a feature to speed up Netflix shows.

231
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,179
Rym: So I can see one use for that.

232
00:12:25,442 --> 00:12:26,897
Rym: Well, I can see two uses for it.

233
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,860
Rym: Use number one, which I think is actually pretty good.

234
00:12:30,121 --> 00:12:37,360
Rym: If you're watching a documentary or a nonfiction thing, those things are so information sparse that I think the same rules apply.

235
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:42,215
Scott: If you're watching like something that is any sort of show that is purely content.

236
00:12:44,282 --> 00:12:44,524
Scott: Right.

237
00:12:44,604 --> 00:12:46,700
Scott: So like a soap opera, soap opera.

238
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:48,879
Scott: It's not about what you see on the screen.

239
00:12:49,362 --> 00:12:52,800
Scott: It's not about like, you know, it's just about knowing what happens next.

240
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,142
Scott: Right.

241
00:12:53,363 --> 00:12:56,640
Rym: Well, so and so, so and so where the acting is good, but usually not.

242
00:12:56,841 --> 00:13:00,360
Scott: Usually, I mean, it could be good, but it's that's not what it's about, even if it is good.

243
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:00,642
Scott: Right.

244
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,599
Scott: It's just about knowing what happens next.

245
00:13:02,942 --> 00:13:04,520
Scott: You guys say one piece, right?

246
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:04,842
Scott: Yeah.

247
00:13:04,862 --> 00:13:06,200
Scott: You can speed through one piece.

248
00:13:06,261 --> 00:13:07,072
Scott: That makes sense.

249
00:13:07,092 --> 00:13:07,619
Scott: Right.

250
00:13:08,142 --> 00:13:09,600
Scott: It's got lots and lots of filler.

251
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,420
Rym: People like to watch that filler because there'll be dramatic moments within it and the animation is really good.

252
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:14,802
Scott: Right.

253
00:13:14,822 --> 00:13:15,719
Scott: But there is lots of filler.

254
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:18,239
Scott: You could turn the speed on during the filler.

255
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:18,902
Scott: Right.

256
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:22,760
Scott: And it's unlike a fast forward where you wouldn't get any of the content.

257
00:13:23,104 --> 00:13:24,260
Scott: It's like this part.

258
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,839
Scott: I just need to know what happens.

259
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:26,682
Scott: Right.

260
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:27,940
Scott: Because it's just filler.

261
00:13:28,401 --> 00:13:29,999
Scott: Here's the actual plot again.

262
00:13:30,382 --> 00:13:31,520
Scott: I'll watch it at normal speed.

263
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:38,420
Rym: So this is the only other case I can see for using this, but it's specific to people like us who have to review stuff, possibly on a deadline.

264
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,380
Rym: Say I have to review an anime and I haven't had time to watch one and like we were going to review the show on Wednesday.

265
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:51,060
Rym: I would still watch like the first two or three episodes at normal speed because it's an audio visual media where like timing and things matter.

266
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,560
Rym: I got to make sure I experience it as it was intended to be experienced.

267
00:13:55,001 --> 00:14:01,700
Rym: But then I might watch three or four more episodes sped up just to get enough content to make sure like it's going in the direction I expect it to be.

268
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,528
Scott: Or just like, you know, let's say I need to get.

269
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,920
Scott: I need to know something about a show, but I don't actually intend to watch it.

270
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:09,321
Scott: Right.

271
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,833
Scott: Maybe, you know, it could be like a lot of times.

272
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,620
Scott: it's like you could find yourself like fast forward.

273
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,800
Scott: I guess we can just scrub around.

274
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,144
Rym: Yeah.

275
00:14:17,164 --> 00:14:18,019
Scott: I don't really need that.

276
00:14:18,381 --> 00:14:20,567
Scott: But, you know, there might be a thing where it's like I need.

277
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:24,820
Scott: I need to know about a thing, but I don't actually want to watch it.

278
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,161
Scott: Yeah.

279
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:25,322
Scott: Right.

280
00:14:25,362 --> 00:14:28,180
Scott: I'm not intending to actually consume this content.

281
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,680
Scott: I just need to extract information out of it, even if it's a work of art.

282
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:34,740
Scott: Like maybe I don't know.

283
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,161
Scott: I need to.

284
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:40,600
Scott: I got to remember they're Bojack Horseman, something I can probably don't care about how well-made Bojack Horseman is.

285
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,780
Rym: But if we had to watch it to do something on the show and you like had to know something about it, that'd be a very good way.

286
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:48,780
Scott: The problem is, is a lot of those things like IMDB just exist.

287
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:56,420
Scott: But imagine if it's the olden days and I want to know like the names of the characters in Jaws or something, I could just put it on speed mode until I learned the characters names.

288
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,502
Scott: I don't know.

289
00:14:57,723 --> 00:15:02,280
Rym: But I feel like this is not aimed at any of the use cases we just brought.

290
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,519
Scott: It is clearly not.

291
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,280
Rym: I feel like I'm going to use a pejorative term here, but I feel like it's appropriate.

292
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:18,560
Rym: I feel like basic people are going to watch the same crap they're watching now and just watch way more of it and binge even more and it's going to feed into those addictive watch the next episode cycles.

293
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:28,200
Rym: Yeah, pretty much like I feel like this is a feature that could have good uses that is going to be abused and is going to be used to the detriment of the medium.

294
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:37,920
Rym: In fact, I imagine shows for a certain demographic might even start assuming people are going to watch it at one point five X and make it that way accordingly.

295
00:15:38,243 --> 00:15:39,959
Rym: Maybe I could see people doing that.

296
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,660
Scott: Yeah, there's a whole, you know, talk to be had.

297
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,598
Scott: We're not going to have about like, you know, the author's intent of the author.

298
00:15:48,461 --> 00:15:52,340
Scott: Do you have a right to, you know, it's your life anyway you want.

299
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,799
Scott: But the way I think of it is like this.

300
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,162
Scott: Right.

301
00:15:54,827 --> 00:15:56,760
Scott: Some chef makes a delicious meal.

302
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:57,442
Scott: Right.

303
00:15:57,462 --> 00:16:00,700
Scott: You know, forget about telling the chef no onions or something like that.

304
00:16:00,941 --> 00:16:01,876
Scott: That's not what I'm talking about.

305
00:16:01,937 --> 00:16:02,120
Scott: Right.

306
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,539
Scott: You know, the chef makes a delicious meal and brings it out to you.

307
00:16:05,982 --> 00:16:06,286
Scott: Right.

308
00:16:06,712 --> 00:16:07,258
Scott: For you to eat.

309
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:16,220
Scott: And you lick it, you just look at all over like, like, like, like, like, like, because you're in you're consuming it the way you want to consume it and you don't bite it.

310
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,914
Rym: Now, I think the right response there would be unless you are a reviewer, like doing some sort of like.

311
00:16:20,954 --> 00:16:22,860
Rym: there's some sort of other angle.

312
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:26,059
Rym: The chef's response would be whatever you paid me for this.

313
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,462
Scott: Right, exactly.

314
00:16:27,522 --> 00:16:36,740
Scott: But at the same time of your preferred way of eat of, you know, buying if you prefer to buy food at a fancy restaurant.

315
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:45,647
Scott: lick it like crazy and not bite it, I judge you, and I rightly judge you, as a person who is, you know, got problems.

316
00:16:45,748 --> 00:16:48,643
Rym: You know what this actually is a very parallel discussion to?

317
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:52,196
Rym: The discussion about how EXP share in Pokemon will now be mandatory.

318
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,687
Rym: It's the exact same conversation.

319
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:59,906
Scott: Well, but EXP share being mandatory is good, and speeding up Netflix is bad, mostly.

320
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:14,844
Rym: Well, but on one hand, if I'm going to be a true Tim Berners-Lee internet, I say the playback means, like, the thing that's playing back content or letting you interact with content can do whatever it wants with that content.

321
00:17:14,885 --> 00:17:16,070
Scott: Of course, technologically.

322
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,584
Rym: So the Netflix, like, if I'm streaming Netflix...

323
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:21,196
Scott: I'm just judging someone who chooses to use it in this way.

324
00:17:21,317 --> 00:17:26,575
Rym: Oh, yes, if you just start watching, like, entire 26 episode shows of, like, good anime...

325
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:29,875
Scott: The same way that I agree, yes, you have freedom of speech to say whatever you want.

326
00:17:29,895 --> 00:17:31,445
Scott: If you say something stupid, I judge you.

327
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:32,268
Rym: I'm gonna laugh at you.

328
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:32,771
Scott: You know what?

329
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:37,851
Scott: You have freedom if to take, to consume, to lick your steak instead of biting it.

330
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,056
Rym: I judge you!

331
00:17:39,397 --> 00:17:48,832
Rym: You are free to watch Carole & Tuesday, a show that is literally about people making music and then performing that music in the show at 1.5x.

332
00:17:49,575 --> 00:17:53,030
Rym: You are welcome to do that, and I will laugh at you until the end of time.

333
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,285
Scott: I will not respect you as a person of high culture.

334
00:17:56,546 --> 00:18:01,444
Rym: But if you're gonna watch a History Channel documentary on Netflix, watch that at, like, 10x.

335
00:18:01,744 --> 00:18:02,647
Scott: Right?

336
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:03,669
Scott: Or just don't watch it?

337
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,271
Scott: Yeah.

338
00:18:04,491 --> 00:18:05,734
Scott: I feel like if something is not worth...

339
00:18:05,754 --> 00:18:06,436
Rym: I feel like you learn more.

340
00:18:06,456 --> 00:18:09,947
Scott: If something isn't worth watching at 1x... The way I'm gonna live my life...

341
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:10,289
Rym: Yeah.

342
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:13,462
Scott: If it's not worth watching at 1x, I'm just not gonna watch it.

343
00:18:13,603 --> 00:18:13,824
Rym: Yeah.

344
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:15,029
Rym: So...

345
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:16,435
Scott: Notice I don't watch a lot.

346
00:18:16,515 --> 00:18:21,941
Rym: Because, well, but all the special cases there, the caveats, are, like, if I'm editing a video of me and Scott...

347
00:18:21,962 --> 00:18:22,626
Scott: I have a reason.

348
00:18:22,827 --> 00:18:27,571
Rym: I'm gonna watch that at, like, 2 or 3x while I'm editing because I don't need to know what I said... Yeah.

349
00:18:27,652 --> 00:18:29,058
Rym: ...two days ago on a stage.

350
00:18:29,198 --> 00:18:29,499
Scott: Anyway.

351
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,482
Rym: I probably remember that.

352
00:18:30,522 --> 00:18:31,284
Scott: Though sometimes I don't.

353
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:32,827
Scott: But, yeah, this is a thing.

354
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:33,268
Rym: Yeah.

355
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:38,180
Rym: So, a lot of you, I don't want to get into all the issues around this, or Scott's money laundering scheme.

356
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,062
Scott: Ah, my money laundering scheme.

357
00:18:40,182 --> 00:18:40,803
Rym: No.

358
00:18:40,923 --> 00:18:45,428
Rym: But many people are very misguided about Adobe.

359
00:18:45,448 --> 00:18:54,760
Rym: Like, they're mad that Adobe switched from a "buy our software and have to buy upgrades every few years" to "pay for a subscription and always have the most up-to-date

360
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,100
Rym: software.".

361
00:18:55,661 --> 00:19:03,840
Rym: I still say the substitution model is fine and perfect, and if that rankles you, it's because Adobe is professional software aimed at professionals.

362
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,023
Scott: That's because they're people who are mad about that.

363
00:19:06,284 --> 00:19:11,132
Scott: They care a lot about principle, even when the reality that, you know, it's like, I actually agree.

364
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:16,220
Scott: In principle, yes, the principle of paying once and just having the thing forever is better.

365
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:24,020
Scott: But the reality is... But the reality, you know, is that doing it the way with a bad principle results in a better life.

366
00:19:24,481 --> 00:19:25,744
Rym: Here's the example.

367
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:31,577
Rym: If I bought Adobe Creative Production Premium, whatever, I paid, like, over $2,000 for this.

368
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,900
Scott: I bought Lightroom some version before it was subscriptionable once.

369
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,236
Rym: No, I bought the Production Premium thing for, like, over $2,000 a long time ago.

370
00:19:40,276 --> 00:19:40,958
Rym: It was, like, CS4.

371
00:19:41,784 --> 00:19:41,954
Scott: Okay.

372
00:19:43,821 --> 00:19:46,760
Rym: I theoretically owned that, and I could still install...

373
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,558
Scott: Oh, a license to it.

374
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,001
Scott: Yeah.

375
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:51,028
Rym: CS4 is fucking garbage.

376
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:54,256
Rym: And if I tried to edit a project in CS4, one, it wouldn't work that well.

377
00:19:54,678 --> 00:19:55,520
Rym: It'd be garbage-y.

378
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,367
Rym: Two, Adobe has no incentive to ever make it better because I'm not paying them anymore.

379
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:05,400
Rym: There's all these reasons why, if you want software to get better, it really needs to have a subscription model.

380
00:20:05,741 --> 00:20:10,495
Rym: If you don't care if software gets better, that software is not something you're using in, like, a production pipeline.

381
00:20:10,515 --> 00:20:11,960
Rym: That's, like, a video game.

382
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:16,081
Rym: I don't need a subscription to Mario 1 because I don't need any changes to Mario 1.

383
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:25,520
Scott: Well, notice there's still software that's developed, so video game people are making effective subscription video games or microtransaction games so they can keep getting money and keep their jobs.

384
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,059
Rym: Which they're doing primarily because...

385
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:35,920
Scott: It's, like, if you want Adobe to start a giant company, make Photoshop, and then shut down after they collect all the money from selling it, then, yeah, the "pay once" model will work.

386
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:43,575
Scott: The reality is, if you want it to keep getting better, and, right, it's, like, you might not need it to get better, in which case, okay, Adobe just go out of business.

387
00:20:43,615 --> 00:20:46,000
Scott: then after they make Photoshop just for you and no one else.

388
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,971
Rym: But if you're a hobbyist, use open source stuff.

389
00:20:49,012 --> 00:20:50,397
Rym: Yeah, it sucks, but guess what?

390
00:20:50,678 --> 00:20:51,140
Rym: That's what...

391
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,591
Scott: Yeah, you're not someone who cares about getting constantly improved stuff.

392
00:20:55,851 --> 00:20:59,380
Rym: You're happy using shitty stuff, so use free or low-cost stuff.

393
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,658
Rym: When we couldn't afford to buy, like, Adobe shit, I used that pirated copy of Cool Edit.

394
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,164
Scott: Free or low-cost stuff, and don't complain.

395
00:21:06,244 --> 00:21:16,120
Scott: If you want the best stuff, then it's gonna be expensive, and people are gonna need to continuously work on it all the time, which means they need to continuously be paid.

396
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:25,580
Scott: So even though you're against, and I'm also against, the principle that I paid for it but now it's somehow it's gone and I can't use it anymore even though I paid, yeah, that principle sucks.

397
00:21:25,981 --> 00:21:29,127
Scott: But the reality is, you get the best possible software.

398
00:21:29,147 --> 00:21:35,480
Scott: that constantly gets better all the time, right, and is amazing, and it's more expensive, but guess what?

399
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,320
Scott: If you just deal with it and pay for it, you get the most amazing softwares.

400
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,474
Rym: Or if you're cheap, like on old GeekNights, I use ReSound on Linux.

401
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:50,378
Scott: You also get more of a right to complain if it isn't the best, 'cause say, "Hey, I'm fucking paying, like, 50 bucks a month for this shit, it better be fucking

402
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:50,820
Scott: amazing.".

403
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:57,175
Rym: So, recently there was an issue where there are sanctions against the Venezuelan government for a lot of reasons.

404
00:21:57,196 --> 00:21:58,940
Rym: Venezuela is a very troubled place right now.

405
00:21:59,662 --> 00:22:01,159
Rym: Many parts of the world are very troubled right now.

406
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,820
Scott: The United States is a very troubled place.

407
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:08,540
Rym: Yep, but I suggest if you haven't seen it in the news because of the hellscape we live in, check out what's going on in Chile.

408
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,630
Scott: Chile, Venezuela, Lebanon, these are the troubled places.

409
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:16,160
Scott: Hong Kong, United States, a lot of troubled places.

410
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,341
Rym: Liberate Hong Kong.

411
00:22:17,822 --> 00:22:32,820
Rym: So, people who want to use bad old Adobe software were pointing at the fact that because there are sanctions against Venezuela, Adobe was obligated by law to cut off access to their software in Venezuela.

412
00:22:34,481 --> 00:22:44,640
Rym: That isn't really an argument against the economics of subscription software, that's an argument against oppressive government regimes and the ties between government and economy.

413
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,340
Scott: The borders actually mattering for software.

414
00:22:48,361 --> 00:22:52,547
Rym: Yep, which also gets complicated because economies are different in places.

415
00:22:52,628 --> 00:23:00,240
Rym: If you charge the same thing everywhere in the world, you can't make enough money to make the thing, or you can't sell to anyone except the industrialized world.

416
00:23:00,601 --> 00:23:02,360
Rym: There's a lot of issues, it's really complicated.

417
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:11,700
Scott: The price that we pay for Adobe whatevers, in Venezuela no one could afford it, so they couldn't have it, which would be fucking them over.

418
00:23:12,061 --> 00:23:15,500
Scott: But if they charged the whole world the Venezuela price, they wouldn't make any fucking money.

419
00:23:16,922 --> 00:23:17,826
Scott: So, it's a tough thing.

420
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:21,460
Scott: They don't really want to regionalize the prices, but what other choice do you have?

421
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:27,272
Rym: But I don't think these people realize that if Adobe wasn't subscription software, they would still cut off Venezuela.

422
00:23:27,292 --> 00:23:29,417
Rym: You couldn't buy another license.

423
00:23:29,517 --> 00:23:30,860
Rym: You couldn't download it anymore.

424
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:35,600
Scott: But the thing is, if you had bought it previously, they couldn't take it away from you.

425
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:47,280
Rym: But if you're at the point where your government is sanctioned by the world such that it can't trade with anyone else, you should be pirating the weapons to make the memes to fight the battle.

426
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,081
Scott: Exactly!

427
00:23:48,181 --> 00:23:54,780
Scott: If you're in a country that isn't trading with the country that makes the thing you want, then you can just fucking pirate it.

428
00:23:55,221 --> 00:23:56,325
Scott: Well, there's no problem.

429
00:23:56,365 --> 00:23:59,015
Scott: You don't agree to the other country's intellectual property laws.

430
00:23:59,276 --> 00:24:00,400
Scott: Just pirate like crazy.

431
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,507
Rym: So, even better, you were all mad at Adobe for this.

432
00:24:03,848 --> 00:24:05,191
Rym: Adobe was actually pissed.

433
00:24:05,693 --> 00:24:08,640
Rym: Adobe did not want to stop giving software to Venezuelans.

434
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,224
Scott: Of course not.

435
00:24:09,265 --> 00:24:10,800
Scott: They wanted to make money from the Venezuelans.

436
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,121
Rym: So Adobe followed up.

437
00:24:12,222 --> 00:24:28,180
Rym: and now Adobe actually has, this is like a very, very breaking story, like 1030 this morning, Adobe has a specific license to bypass the sanctions and continue to let people in Venezuela use their software.

438
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:35,377
Scott: Right, so at first Adobe was just going to refund everybody, but now they're like, "Okay, we'll give you a whole bunch of free months because of all the

439
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:35,778
Scott: trouble.".

440
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:36,720
Scott: Right?

441
00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:49,740
Rym: Now, this seems like the right call because selling this kind of software, like continuing to let the people of Venezuela use the software, this is the kind of software that can help them make their movement and maybe try to fix their government.

442
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,280
Scott: Right, they can produce all kinds of amazing protest videos.

443
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,826
Rym: And Adobe seems to have done the right thing, like they got the exemption.

444
00:24:56,906 --> 00:25:04,660
Rym: Everyone did the right thing, except the Venezuelan government and most of the US government, but not all of the US government.

445
00:25:06,144 --> 00:25:08,080
Rym: In some other news, new AirPods are coming.

446
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:11,667
Scott: Right, so Apple made AirPods and AirPods are garbage.

447
00:25:12,027 --> 00:25:18,240
Scott: Apple made headphones, the ones that are Apple branded because Apple owns Beats, I guess, and some of those are okay-ish, not the best.

448
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,200
Rym: I mean, if you buy, in the old days, like you buy an iPod or an iPhone or whatever and it comes with headphones.

449
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,080
Scott: I have a backup pair that I've never opened.

450
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,680
Rym: Yeah, rule one, throw those away and buy real headphones.

451
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:33,780
Scott: Right, the Apple headphones, the main problem with them has always been A, not comfortable, B, don't really fit nicely in the ear so much.

452
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,519
Scott: But the biggest problem is not noise canceling or isolating in any way.

453
00:25:38,321 --> 00:25:41,989
Scott: So you put them in, all the outside noises still get right in your ear.

454
00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:47,700
Scott: You've got to turn the volume on them way up in order to hear if there's any loud noises around you and then you end up damaging your ear.

455
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:51,194
Scott: If you keep it quiet and low volume so you don't damage your ear, guess what?

456
00:25:51,214 --> 00:25:52,500
Scott: You can't hear your music or anything.

457
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,024
Rym: What's sad is this isn't new.

458
00:25:54,626 --> 00:25:56,612
Rym: Very few people use isolating headphones.

459
00:25:56,632 --> 00:25:57,796
Rym: Like in the 70s, 80s, 90s, headphones...

460
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,799
Scott: Well, those isolating and noise canceling weren't really a thing then.

461
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:06,260
Rym: Yeah, I mean, you could get real closed headphones but people didn't wear those in public.

462
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,619
Scott: But they weren't active noise canceling.

463
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,360
Rym: But people just stupidly destroy their hearing because they don't understand these basic principles.

464
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,320
Scott: Anyway, so, people still don't.

465
00:26:18,345 --> 00:26:22,996
Rym: I was on the subway today and someone was wearing earbuds that were so loud.

466
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:24,760
Rym: It sounded like a speaker.

467
00:26:26,421 --> 00:26:31,540
Scott: So I've always been buying isolating headphones from other companies but they have a host of problems.

468
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,540
Scott: The etymotic ones, which are really amazing and perfect, the wire keeps breaking because it's too fragile.

469
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,760
Rym: The etymotics are more like... And it's not replaceable wire.

470
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,047
Rym: Yeah, don't use those on the go.

471
00:26:40,088 --> 00:26:41,960
Rym: Those are what you use in your home system.

472
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,744
Scott: No, for many years.

473
00:26:42,784 --> 00:26:46,240
Scott: And I had to keep buying and warranting and all kinds of stuff because the wire kept breaking.

474
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:47,408
Rym: That's why I went with Shure.

475
00:26:47,428 --> 00:26:48,820
Rym: Because Shure is super high quality.

476
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,669
Scott: Then I tried the appley Beats ones.

477
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,620
Scott: The Beats X, recommended by a listener, Luke.

478
00:26:56,341 --> 00:26:58,427
Scott: And those were kind of comfortable.

479
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:02,640
Scott: They sounded a little heavy on the bass but they still sounded good enough.

480
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,620
Scott: And the wireless connection to the iPhone was great because Beats is owned by Apple.

481
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:14,798
Scott: So they connected and there's like a special Apple wireless headphone connecty thing that only Apple and Beats headphones do.

482
00:27:14,938 --> 00:27:15,520
Scott: that I know of.

483
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,887
Scott: That made it a little more... It's still Bluetooth.

484
00:27:18,308 --> 00:27:22,140
Scott: It's just the connection process is a little more seamless and a little more fancy.

485
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:24,249
Scott: And for example, you connect it to your iPhone.

486
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:25,032
Scott: It's automatically.

487
00:27:25,073 --> 00:27:26,620
Scott: your iPad just knows about it now.

488
00:27:26,981 --> 00:27:28,244
Scott: It does fancy shit like that.

489
00:27:28,505 --> 00:27:33,300
Scott: And usually with Bluetooth, it's still... Bluetooth is still pretty seamless these days but a little bit flaky.

490
00:27:34,463 --> 00:27:37,730
Scott: So it's nice to have that if you are an iOS person.

491
00:27:38,452 --> 00:27:41,900
Scott: So those are okay but then the battery or something on them messed up.

492
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,164
Scott: I had to take them in for service.

493
00:27:43,184 --> 00:27:46,837
Scott: Then I got new ones and the new ones weren't perfect.

494
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,127
Scott: And I was not the most thrilled with them.

495
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:54,520
Scott: And also, they were more isolating than Apple freaking earbuds.

496
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,440
Scott: They were not really isolating like the etymotic ones where you hear nothing.

497
00:27:59,382 --> 00:28:07,420
Scott: So I got the Shure ones similar to what Rym has and they're isolating like the etymotic ones are and the cable is replaceable.

498
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:14,160
Scott: Which is really nice because that way I can go wired with a headphone jack or I can go Bluetooth with a separate special Bluetooth cable.

499
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,006
Scott: And the earbuds presumably will never break.

500
00:28:17,026 --> 00:28:17,547
Scott: So that's great.

501
00:28:18,228 --> 00:28:23,200
Scott: The problem is that the Bluetooth cable is not... The Bluetooth is not the best.

502
00:28:24,463 --> 00:28:28,391
Scott: The cable is good but I don't like to have a cable.

503
00:28:28,752 --> 00:28:32,280
Scott: Whether my phone has a headphone jack or not, not having a cable is nice.

504
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,149
Rym: I've used expensive Bluetooth headphones, cheap Bluetooth headphones.

505
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:38,280
Rym: Bluetooth audio works okay.

506
00:28:40,065 --> 00:28:41,874
Scott: When you're connected and it's working, it's great.

507
00:28:41,914 --> 00:28:43,140
Scott: You have wireless headphones.

508
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,420
Rym: But then you'll get interference.

509
00:28:44,761 --> 00:28:57,700
Scott: There are certain places in the city where like I walk and the headphone goes like... Also the cable that is around from earbud to earbud with the battery and stuff on it is sort of floppy around the neck and kind of annoying.

510
00:28:58,381 --> 00:29:00,649
Scott: And that is the major feature of the Apple AirPod.

511
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,700
Scott: It's just as shitty as every other fucking Apple headphone.

512
00:29:05,081 --> 00:29:07,187
Scott: But it's just two little guys.

513
00:29:07,507 --> 00:29:11,980
Scott: So it's like totally perfect and you don't have the stupid cable around your neck and it has perfect wireless connection.

514
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,344
Scott: So that's the feature you want.

515
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:14,749
Scott: You just need the isolating.

516
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:15,371
Scott: So here we go.

517
00:29:15,812 --> 00:29:16,595
Scott: Rumor was true.

518
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:18,180
Scott: Apple announces AirPods Pro.

519
00:29:18,681 --> 00:29:19,484
Scott: They're AirPods.

520
00:29:19,584 --> 00:29:19,986
Scott: Perfect.

521
00:29:20,026 --> 00:29:21,070
Scott: Two little white guys.

522
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,395
Scott: Two little white guys.

523
00:29:22,515 --> 00:29:22,736
Scott: It's us.

524
00:29:23,017 --> 00:29:23,640
Scott: Two little white guys.

525
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,653
Scott: Perfect wireless connection but also isolation plus active noise cancelling.

526
00:29:28,674 --> 00:29:29,556
Scott: You shove them in your ear.

527
00:29:29,917 --> 00:29:30,840
Scott: The best of everything.

528
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,557
Scott: The only problem with these is they're $200 something.

529
00:29:35,323 --> 00:29:40,320
Rym: For $250 I could get like two super professional quality IEMs.

530
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,721
Scott: Right.

531
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:47,015
Scott: And also just like the regular AirPods, the battery does not last forever.

532
00:29:47,095 --> 00:29:49,360
Scott: The battery will die in like two to three years.

533
00:29:49,981 --> 00:29:51,929
Scott: And you can't really replace the battery.

534
00:29:51,969 --> 00:29:55,000
Scott: You're just going to have to buy more AirPod Pros.

535
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,347
Scott: So it's like it's bad enough to replace AirPods after two years.

536
00:29:58,367 --> 00:30:03,400
Scott: You're going to replace... Which are not that... They're expensive but not as expensive as AirPod Pro.

537
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:06,206
Scott: You can spend $200 every... $100 a year.

538
00:30:06,307 --> 00:30:07,913
Scott: Over $100 a year just to have these.

539
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:09,841
Rym: Yup.

540
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:14,354
Rym: I've got the same IEMs that I bought seven years ago and they're fine.

541
00:30:14,394 --> 00:30:20,834
Rym: And also they have a wire because I don't actually... On one hand I can see why some people really like the wireless aspect.

542
00:30:20,934 --> 00:30:22,400
Scott: It's really nice not having the wire.

543
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,595
Rym: But on the other hand the wire has literally never been a problem and it also means that...

544
00:30:25,876 --> 00:30:26,619
Scott: It's one of those things...

545
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:33,840
Rym: But it means the same headphone that I plug into my phone and my Switch... You can't use these iPods with your Switch, can you?

546
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,223
Scott: Probably not, no.

547
00:30:35,283 --> 00:30:35,544
Scott: Yeah.

548
00:30:35,765 --> 00:30:37,531
Rym: So I have the same headphones one time instead of...

549
00:30:37,551 --> 00:30:39,698
Scott: I don't know why the Switch does not support Bluetooth audio.

550
00:30:39,718 --> 00:30:40,160
Scott: That's a problem.

551
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,685
Scott: That's on Nintendo.

552
00:30:41,846 --> 00:30:42,650
Rym: Yeah, but I'm saying...

553
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,760
Scott: Because there is a Bluetooth radio in there.

554
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:52,200
Rym: Because I have an Android phone, I plug the same headphones into the phone, the Switch, the tablet, and if I'm on a plane I plug it into the airplane.

555
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:52,600
Scott: Yup.

556
00:30:52,921 --> 00:30:59,576
Scott: So... That is nice, but it's one of those things where it's like I've never had that wire.

557
00:30:59,656 --> 00:31:00,458
Scott: I've always had a wire.

558
00:31:00,478 --> 00:31:01,260
Scott: It's never been a problem.

559
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:05,778
Scott: And then you go without the wire for a while and then if you put the wire back in you're like, "Eh, this is an annoying

560
00:31:05,818 --> 00:31:06,059
Scott: wire.".

561
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,900
Rym: But the wire is required for most of the things I plug headphones into, like my Switch or an airplane.

562
00:31:14,461 --> 00:31:22,020
Scott: The only time I have a wired headphone necessary... I don't use the audio on airplanes whenever I'm on airplanes.

563
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,784
Rym: I watch movies on planes kind of often.

564
00:31:23,845 --> 00:31:24,587
Scott: I do not do that.

565
00:31:25,189 --> 00:31:28,880
Scott: I turn the screen off and do not look at that screen full of ads and garbage.

566
00:31:29,061 --> 00:31:32,460
Rym: But if you fly on a nice flight it's just a giant screen that you can watch real movies on.

567
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,847
Scott: I do not watch those movies.

568
00:31:35,134 --> 00:31:36,100
Scott: So I don't have that problem.

569
00:31:36,802 --> 00:31:37,939
Rym: That's how I watch your name.

570
00:31:39,185 --> 00:31:40,140
Scott: I watch it in a theater.

571
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:45,119
Rym: I also watch it in a theater, but I watched it early because I was on a JL flight and they just showed it.

572
00:31:45,881 --> 00:31:51,100
Scott: Yeah, the only time I plug headphones in with a wire is my home desktop because my headphones are wired.

573
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,869
Scott: I plug them into the top of the computer at work.

574
00:31:53,231 --> 00:31:54,780
Scott: I have Bluetooth connected to the laptop.

575
00:31:55,281 --> 00:32:00,315
Rym: So last news that I just want to point out.

576
00:32:00,395 --> 00:32:16,140
Rym: I'm not going to go into all the details about this story, but this is one of a huge number of examples where basically there's a hospital algorithm or the set of algorithms that's used to determine, given a bunch of people, who to prioritize treatment for, like triage type stuff.

577
00:32:16,581 --> 00:32:18,820
Rym: If there's ten people and you have four doctors...

578
00:32:20,382 --> 00:32:22,000
Scott: Who's in the waiting room and who's going to the doctor?

579
00:32:22,622 --> 00:32:29,246
Rym: If you spend your resources on someone who's not likely to make it versus someone who's likely to make it with treatment, what do you do?

580
00:32:29,287 --> 00:32:31,239
Rym: These are really hard questions to answer.

581
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:39,260
Scott: Right, but with a shit ton of medical data, even anonymized data, it should be theoretically possible to make better decisions on this than a human would.

582
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,023
Scott: You have a fuck ton of data.

583
00:32:41,484 --> 00:32:48,379
Scott: The doctor can't just know, "Oh yeah, someone who has these symptoms...".

584
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:53,720
Scott: It's like the doctor can't even diagnose the person until they're in the room and they're looking at them.

585
00:32:54,662 --> 00:32:58,116
Scott: But the computer could maybe be like, "Alright, we've got symptoms and that's all we've

586
00:32:58,136 --> 00:32:58,377
Scott: got.".

587
00:32:59,321 --> 00:33:01,871
Scott: "Alright, well that person is bleeding all over the place.

588
00:33:01,911 --> 00:33:03,859
Scott: This person may be broken on...".

589
00:33:05,881 --> 00:33:22,560
Rym: So the problem is, for a lot of reasons that you can guess at these reasons, talk to an old person or read a book if you're unclear on this, but the data that we're going to use to feed these algorithms and these AI systems is already really racist and biased,

590
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,724
Scott: because the data

591
00:33:23,764 --> 00:33:26,620
Rym: is collected from a pretty racist and biased society.

592
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:32,500
Rym: So imagine an algorithm that decides whether or not someone you're about to hire for a job is trustworthy.

593
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:41,260
Rym: That algorithm is going to be based on the data sets collected by people who have been hiring up to this point, which there is a history of racist, biased hiring.

594
00:33:41,843 --> 00:33:45,360
Rym: Therefore, you're just going to train the computer to be as racist as society.

595
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:53,800
Scott: Well, what you could do is you could have that old data, right, and then instead of telling it, "Hey computer, do like we did in the past...".

596
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,519
Rym: "Hey computer, find the biases and fix

597
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:55,600
Rym: it.".

598
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:59,090
Scott: Well, you could be like, "Computer, in the past we fucked the fuck up.

599
00:33:59,792 --> 00:34:02,499
Scott: You make decisions, not according to this

600
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:02,640
Scott: data.".

601
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:07,516
Scott: You know, you have this data, use it, but don't do it this way.

602
00:34:07,576 --> 00:34:08,699
Scott: that the old data did it.

603
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,239
Scott: But that's hard to do.

604
00:34:10,661 --> 00:34:13,976
Scott: Of course, but look at that old data and don't do it that way.

605
00:34:14,056 --> 00:34:14,860
Scott: Do it a different way.

606
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,188
Scott: Optimize for this other thing.

607
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:17,739
Scott: Don't optimize for this, right?

608
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:19,143
Scott: But people don't do that.

609
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:22,618
Scott: They just write a real simple program that's like, "Pick who's most likely to

610
00:34:22,658 --> 00:34:23,080
Scott: survive.".

611
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:26,920
Scott: Well, yeah, when doctors were racist, black people didn't survive.

612
00:34:27,702 --> 00:34:30,239
Scott: So you're going to keep telling the doctors to treat white people.

613
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,560
Scott: Because you're not doing it because they're white, you're doing it because they're more likely to survive.

614
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,600
Scott: Because in the past, they were more likely to survive in racist land.

615
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:45,420
Rym: The provenance of your data and the way it was collected is very important if you're using it for any real AI application.

616
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:55,550
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

617
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:57,236
Rym: So I just saw this tweet come by.

618
00:34:57,256 --> 00:35:00,310
Rym: Apparently there's the Helvetica font, which is an okay font.

619
00:35:01,071 --> 00:35:05,130
Rym: But there are many things that are called Helvetica.

620
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:10,610
Scott: Yeah, it's just like an obvious, the most softball, easy joke that anyone could think of.

621
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,830
Scott: So it's so bleh that it's not even funny.

622
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,818
Rym: There's like a band called Helvetica.

623
00:35:14,838 --> 00:35:17,870
Rym: I've seen like ten different fonts called Helvetica.

624
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:18,974
Rym: They're just shitty in some way.

625
00:35:19,295 --> 00:35:23,230
Rym: But they're always like either satanic or like rooty.

626
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:24,636
Rym: Like they're always something like that.

627
00:35:25,158 --> 00:35:27,469
Rym: I found the true Helvetica.

628
00:35:28,731 --> 00:35:32,447
Rym: It is identical to regular Helvetica except the kerning is broken.

629
00:35:32,467 --> 00:35:33,030
Rym: That's it.

630
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,979
Rym: It's just bad kerning Helvetica.

631
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:36,728
Rym: And it's really funny to look at.

632
00:35:37,332 --> 00:35:38,550
Scott: Okay, I don't think it's that funny.

633
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,369
Rym: I think it's pretty funny.

634
00:35:39,517 --> 00:35:39,686
Rym: Okay.

635
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:40,906
Rym: So what do you got?

636
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:46,190
Scott: So in China, right, there was a mafia boss.

637
00:35:46,474 --> 00:35:47,069
Scott: All right.

638
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:55,208
Scott: And the mafia boss hired a hitman and said, "Kill my rival mafia boss hitman and I will give you many

639
00:35:55,308 --> 00:35:55,689
Scott: monies.".

640
00:35:56,735 --> 00:35:59,130
Rym: He's only going to pay him $282,000.

641
00:35:59,130 --> 00:35:59,768
Scott: That's a lot of monies.

642
00:36:00,211 --> 00:36:00,550
Rym: Depends.

643
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:01,632
Scott: I mean, yeah.

644
00:36:01,732 --> 00:36:04,566
Scott: But anyway, I feel like for a hitman.

645
00:36:04,606 --> 00:36:05,108
Scott: that's one hit.

646
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:08,322
Rym: If you only got to work a week a year to make $282,000 a year, okay.

647
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:11,371
Rym: Tax-free.

648
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,538
Rym: You're not paying taxes on that.

649
00:36:12,558 --> 00:36:14,449
Rym: At least I hope not.

650
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:16,041
Scott: Anyway.

651
00:36:18,312 --> 00:36:19,059
Rym: IRS, what do you do?

652
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,089
Scott: I am a hitman.

653
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:23,597
Scott: This hitman figures, "You know what?

654
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,689
Scott: I want this money, but I don't really want to kill this other mafia

655
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:28,970
Scott: boss.".

656
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,054
Scott: That's A, hard.

657
00:36:30,295 --> 00:36:31,119
Scott: B, dangerous.

658
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,590
Scott: C, it's clear why you would not want to do that.

659
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:38,266
Scott: But it's also clear why you would want to not tell the first mafia boss, "No, thank you.

660
00:36:38,306 --> 00:36:38,968
Scott: I'm not going to do

661
00:36:39,028 --> 00:36:39,089
Scott: it.".

662
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:39,771
Scott: Right?

663
00:36:40,093 --> 00:36:43,209
Scott: You want to say, "Yes, I'll do it," and somehow get away with not doing it.

664
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:43,519
Rym: Yeah.

665
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:48,770
Scott: So, genius hitman hires another hitman.

666
00:36:50,491 --> 00:36:51,249
Rym: Subcontracted hitman.

667
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,104
Scott: So, the thing about it, you're getting what?

668
00:36:54,104 --> 00:36:54,426
Scott: $282,000 something?

669
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,690
Scott: So let's just say $300,000.

670
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:57,456
Rym: Oh, he split it in half.

671
00:36:57,577 --> 00:36:57,980
Rym: I'll keep $141,000.

672
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,350
Rym: I'll give you $141,000.

673
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,630
Scott: The other guy doesn't even know he's getting it split in half.

674
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:04,941
Scott: He's just like, "Look, I'll give you $140,000 to kill this mafia

675
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:05,202
Scott: boss.".

676
00:37:05,202 --> 00:37:07,592
Scott: $140,000.

677
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,190
Rym: Still a pretty good salary for a year.

678
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:10,896
Scott: All right.

679
00:37:10,997 --> 00:37:11,442
Scott: All right.

680
00:37:11,827 --> 00:37:12,050
Scott: Right?

681
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:22,748
Scott: And that guy, he's thinking, "Hey, I could hire someone else to do this hit and pay them like

682
00:37:22,748 --> 00:37:24,371
Scott: $70,000.".

683
00:37:24,371 --> 00:37:31,458
Scott: And this exact thing not only is a hilarious story that would make for a great movie, it's a real story that really happened.

684
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:35,190
Scott: It got all the way down to the fifth hitman.

685
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:38,470
Rym: But the fifth hitman had such a good idea.

686
00:37:39,071 --> 00:37:42,470
Scott: Was smarter, yet also dumber than all the other hitmen.

687
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:49,110
Scott: The fifth hitman went to the victim, the person who had the hit, the rival mafia boss.

688
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,230
Rym: Because he's not making that much money at this point anyway.

689
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:51,470
Scott: Right.

690
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:52,294
Scott: He's not getting paid enough.

691
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:54,242
Scott: And he's saying, "Look, bro.

692
00:37:54,744 --> 00:37:56,089
Scott: Somebody paid me to kill

693
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:56,230
Scott: you.".

694
00:37:56,632 --> 00:37:59,810
Scott: And this person doesn't even know who the original hit person was.

695
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:03,769
Scott: He can't even rat out the original mafia boss to the rival guy.

696
00:38:04,551 --> 00:38:09,002
Scott: But he can say, "Look, fake your death.

697
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:14,737
Scott: You fake your death and I'll get money from this fourth hitman, who I don't even know is the fourth hitman.

698
00:38:16,164 --> 00:38:17,509
Scott: And then we'll split that money.

699
00:38:19,135 --> 00:38:20,365
Scott: Just fake your death so we both get

700
00:38:20,406 --> 00:38:20,587
Scott: money.".

701
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,175
Rym: You know, good on him.

702
00:38:22,195 --> 00:38:26,170
Rym: He's the only one who didn't take an action that would lead to another person's death.

703
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:28,678
Rym: So, I don't know how...

704
00:38:28,698 --> 00:38:32,070
Scott: I assume China's justice system is not that just.

705
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,856
Scott: I mean, ours isn't that just.

706
00:38:34,016 --> 00:38:36,750
Scott: I assume China's is possibly less just.

707
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:43,790
Scott: But regardless, there's a photo of the courtroom with all of the hitmen lined up.

708
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,250
Scott: And apparently there was more news since I read the story.

709
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:50,527
Rym: They all look mad and sad, except this guy who seems like, "Eh, you got

710
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:50,648
Rym: me.".

711
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,876
Scott: Right.

712
00:38:53,157 --> 00:38:56,890
Scott: So, Rym apparently read more details on the story, I guess, that are more recent.

713
00:38:57,151 --> 00:38:58,530
Scott: Oh, so there's even further updates.

714
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:03,170
Scott: Some of the hitmen got off because I guess the last guy technically didn't commit a crime.

715
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:03,987
Scott: All he did was...

716
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:06,150
Rym: Well, he committed a crime, but he didn't commit attempted murder.

717
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:07,129
Scott: Oh, that's true.

718
00:39:07,371 --> 00:39:08,399
Rym: But it gets more complicated.

719
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,690
Rym: I found even yet more updates.

720
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,249
Scott: He didn't hire a hitman, which is illegal.

721
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,880
Rym: I guess the first trial had some problems.

722
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,482
Rym: They did it again.

723
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:16,370
Rym: Eventually, they all went to jail.

724
00:39:16,631 --> 00:39:17,013
Scott: Okay.

725
00:39:17,977 --> 00:39:21,170
Scott: Regardless, that is a hilarious story that someone's going to make a movie out of.

726
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,108
Rym: But some people were like, "No, this would be the best Guy Ritchie

727
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:24,389
Rym: movie.".

728
00:39:25,201 --> 00:39:25,689
Rym: Oh my God.

729
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,710
Scott: It just is a Guy Ritchie movie.

730
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:32,450
Scott: Are you sure it isn't like a Guy Ritchie faked his news story so that he could then make a movie?

731
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:36,389
Scott: No, Guy Ritchie hired the original mob boss to put the hit out.

732
00:39:38,872 --> 00:39:40,429
Scott: He's like, "Look, I know five cowardly

733
00:39:40,449 --> 00:39:40,570
Scott: hitmen.".

734
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:43,768
Scott: You have to hire this guy and they all know each other.

735
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,116
Rym: I would just call the movie.

736
00:39:45,136 --> 00:39:46,810
Rym: The movie would literally be called Five Cowardly Hitmen.

737
00:39:46,971 --> 00:39:47,326
Scott: I don't know.

738
00:39:49,235 --> 00:39:50,129
Scott: This is such a great story.

739
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,970
Rym: In the meta moment, the GeekNights Book Club book is still the Tale of Genji.

740
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:54,736
Rym: It's going to be a while.

741
00:39:54,756 --> 00:39:56,169
Rym: We're going to pick an inner Rym book.

742
00:39:56,592 --> 00:39:56,741
Rym: Alright.

743
00:39:57,491 --> 00:39:58,039
Rym: I got to pick it.

744
00:39:58,141 --> 00:39:58,405
Rym: Stay tuned.

745
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:01,346
Scott: Or we could do several episodes on Tale of Genji.

746
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:03,270
Scott: There's another I. And just do piece by piece.

747
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,029
Rym: Like chapters.

748
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:04,930
Rym: Yeah.

749
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,250
Rym: Good chapter by chapter, maybe.

750
00:40:06,592 --> 00:40:07,189
Scott: That's too many.

751
00:40:07,792 --> 00:40:08,689
Rym: How many chapters are there?

752
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:08,961
Rym: A lot.

753
00:40:09,151 --> 00:40:10,149
Rym: It's like the tea set thing.

754
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:11,329
Rym: But the incense thing.

755
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:11,789
Scott: It's big.

756
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:12,250
Rym: Yeah.

757
00:40:12,711 --> 00:40:13,970
Rym: Anyway, we'll do it at some interval.

758
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:15,310
Rym: We'll say how far we got.

759
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,966
Rym: We'll be like, "Hey, we're going to do a book club on the first

760
00:40:17,006 --> 00:40:17,168
Rym: bit.".

761
00:40:17,476 --> 00:40:17,666
Scott: Anyway.

762
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,969
Rym: Because then we can speculate on what's going to happen next.

763
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:20,504
Scott: We'll see.

764
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:23,060
Rym: Yeah.

765
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:28,070
Rym: We're going to be live at PEX Unplugged doing... I'll post the schedule when I get a chance.

766
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:28,848
Rym: We're doing one talk.

767
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:32,410
Rym: A brand new talk called Take Your Fucking Turn.

768
00:40:32,691 --> 00:40:33,069
Scott: Hell yeah.

769
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:35,450
Rym: And we're going to do another talk that is two hours long.

770
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:39,450
Rym: We're going to teach you how to play and play with you three different board games.

771
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:40,590
Rym: All in the same room.

772
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,010
Rym: One, two, three.

773
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,750
Scott: Are we sure we're going to be able to do that in the allotted time?

774
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,590
Rym: Definitely with the games we're doing.

775
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,050
Rym: Plus, we'll do Wizard last.

776
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:51,470
Rym: Because Wizard can stop after any number of hands because people will have gotten the gist.

777
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:53,230
Rym: So I think we're good there.

778
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,430
Scott: It'd be kind of lame if it stopped after the first or second hand.

779
00:40:55,531 --> 00:40:56,750
Rym: I feel like we could get further in.

780
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:57,869
Rym: These games are not hard to teach.

781
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:01,610
Rym: I think Genshin Clever might take the longest, but we can move it along.

782
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:04,749
Scott: What else do we got?

783
00:41:04,911 --> 00:41:08,549
Rym: PAX East, PAX Unplugged, PAX West, PAX Fest, PAX East.

784
00:41:09,232 --> 00:41:10,070
Rym: All this is coming.

785
00:41:11,416 --> 00:41:12,029
Rym: Let's get into it.

786
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,210
Rym: Talk about microphones.

787
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:21,610
Scott: So we got to avoid doing what is a high crime worse than hiring a hitman, which is doing a podcast about podcasting.

788
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:22,007
Scott: Yup.

789
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:22,746
Scott: That is a crime.

790
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,210
Rym: I feel like there's a podcast now.

791
00:41:24,711 --> 00:41:27,224
Scott: Enough of those were made, you know, 14, 15 years ago.

792
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:31,710
Scott: No more shall ever be made, especially not by two white dudes.

793
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:39,028
Rym: Though what I would say that is kind of fascinating is everything that tells people how to make podcasts tends to be full of terrible goddamn advice.

794
00:41:39,048 --> 00:41:39,990
Rym: that makes bad podcasts.

795
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:42,410
Scott: The only advice you need to start is to just talk.

796
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:42,930
Rym: Content is king.

797
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,630
Scott: Talk into a microphone, make an MP3 and upload at the end.

798
00:41:45,811 --> 00:41:46,490
Scott: Content is king.

799
00:41:46,811 --> 00:41:47,429
Scott: So, microphones.

800
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:51,770
Scott: The number one rule is you must not use a microphone as your logo if you are a podcast.

801
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,570
Scott: Unless your podcast is about microphones.

802
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:58,590
Scott: Our podcast is about nerdy things, therefore our logo should have nerdy things in it.

803
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,670
Rym: I feel like the only reason.

804
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:02,650
Scott: Podcast about soccer shouldn't have a microphone in it, it should have a soccer ball.

805
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:08,610
Rym: You might have noticed we changed our logo and we're currently rebranding because it's kind of bridging from the meta moment into the main bit.

806
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:17,330
Rym: But I feel like the only reason our logo, the old logo with the microphone gets a pass is that there were like 12 podcasts when we started.

807
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,369
Rym: Like there weren't that many podcasts.

808
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:23,870
Scott: Anyway, so we're going to talk only about microphones, right?

809
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:28,050
Scott: The things you talk into and the hardware and the types and such and such.

810
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:35,290
Rym: Because I've realized in my life that most people know fuck all about microphones even though they use them all the time.

811
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,310
Scott: They don't know how to use them.

812
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:43,330
Rym: Yeah, like people will use microphones that are designed to work no matter how stupid you are in incredibly stupid ways.

813
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:46,290
Rym: And I see people, like speakers, they do the same thing.

814
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:56,170
Rym: You'll see people who have the PC volume set all the way down but then their amplifier, like the external one is set to the max volume and all sorts of just terrible ideas.

815
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,587
Scott: So what was the first ever microphone?

816
00:42:59,310 --> 00:42:59,692
Rym: Oh, I don't know.

817
00:42:59,753 --> 00:43:00,336
Rym: That history?

818
00:43:00,376 --> 00:43:02,087
Rym: That was probably that liquid microphone.

819
00:43:02,147 --> 00:43:02,529
Rym: Let's see.

820
00:43:03,271 --> 00:43:06,330
Rym: In order to speak, the first microphone ever was a megaphone.

821
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:07,216
Scott: Uh-huh.

822
00:43:07,236 --> 00:43:07,560
Scott: That's true.

823
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:09,529
Rym: Yeah, well.

824
00:43:10,372 --> 00:43:10,795
Rym: You know what?

825
00:43:10,876 --> 00:43:12,809
Scott: I actually don't know how the fucking megaphone works.

826
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:13,353
Rym: Really?

827
00:43:13,374 --> 00:43:14,289
Rym: You really don't?

828
00:43:15,575 --> 00:43:16,349
Scott: It's just a big horn.

829
00:43:17,611 --> 00:43:19,270
Rym: A megaphone or a microphone?

830
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:20,210
Scott: Like a megaphone.

831
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:21,243
Rym: Resonance.

832
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:22,587
Scott: Oh, is that it?

833
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:23,903
Scott: Acoustic amplification.

834
00:43:23,963 --> 00:43:24,510
Rym: It's a whole thing.

835
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:25,152
Rym: Alright.

836
00:43:25,393 --> 00:43:29,430
Scott: But like if I can talk into a big horn, like a Viking, and just be loud.

837
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:32,288
Scott: But a megaphone is a lot smaller and has a battery in it.

838
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:39,230
Rym: So megaphones used to not have batteries or electronics.

839
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:39,830
Scott: Okay.

840
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:42,035
Scott: I understand how a horn works.

841
00:43:42,377 --> 00:43:45,410
Scott: But how does like a modern megaphone that I would buy at like the sporting goods store.

842
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,822
Rym: I want to give you a second to not feel dumb about this.

843
00:43:48,184 --> 00:43:49,390
Rym: Because it's really simple.

844
00:43:49,612 --> 00:43:50,109
Scott: How does it work?

845
00:43:51,153 --> 00:43:53,450
Rym: The point you're talking to is a microphone.

846
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:56,230
Rym: And there's a speaker on the other side.

847
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:56,810
Scott: With an amp.

848
00:43:57,072 --> 00:43:57,810
Scott: And then a horn.

849
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:58,346
Scott: That's it.

850
00:43:58,610 --> 00:43:59,041
Scott: And a horn.

851
00:43:59,205 --> 00:43:59,348
Scott: Okay.

852
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:07,770
Rym: The horn part coming out is just an acoustic amplifier in addition to the electric amplifier inside of the thing.

853
00:44:08,472 --> 00:44:13,350
Scott: So you're just using a smaller horn with a powered amplifier so that you don't need a big horn.

854
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,329
Rym: That's literally all it is.

855
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:15,094
Scott: Okay.

856
00:44:15,134 --> 00:44:15,679
Scott: That's boring.

857
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:16,769
Scott: I thought there was something in there.

858
00:44:17,151 --> 00:44:21,230
Rym: I owned one of those megaphones for a while, but I got rid of it because that was a real waste of time.

859
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,262
Rym: I was going to bring it to Connecticut.

860
00:44:23,282 --> 00:44:23,990
Rym: It'd be real annoying.

861
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:27,470
Scott: They're mostly used on like, you know, these days for like not much.

862
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:28,388
Rym: There's cops.

863
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:29,790
Scott: People just use PA systems.

864
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:33,870
Rym: There's cops in Grand Central every day using them to yell at people to not go up the downstairs.

865
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:36,468
Scott: I see them mostly use like boats to yell at other boats.

866
00:44:36,962 --> 00:44:37,005
Scott: No.

867
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:38,220
Scott: Who have like a radio.

868
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:39,110
Scott: They're just really close.

869
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:40,979
Rym: So let's talk about first things first.

870
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,369
Rym: What does a microphone do?

871
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:50,850
Rym: Because there's microphones are actually both electrically and mechanically very, very simple devices on the surface.

872
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:56,490
Rym: And the details only matter if you are doing things a little more complicated than just talking on a phone.

873
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:58,722
Scott: So the idea is that someone's talking, right?

874
00:44:58,883 --> 00:45:00,070
Scott: Or you're making noise.

875
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:01,329
Rym: Sound is happening.

876
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:05,063
Scott: You want to capture that noise in an electrical form.

877
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:07,170
Scott: You want to turn noise into electricity, right?

878
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:10,003
Rym: And then from electricity, turn it into something else later.

879
00:45:10,244 --> 00:45:11,350
Rym: We don't care what you turn it into.

880
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:15,703
Scott: Well, it just so happens, we're very lucky that noise is an analog signal.

881
00:45:15,743 --> 00:45:17,327
Scott: It is waves in the air.

882
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:18,170
Scott: Sound waves.

883
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:18,948
Rym: Vibrations.

884
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:19,753
Scott: Vibrations.

885
00:45:19,793 --> 00:45:20,859
Scott: The air is shaking.

886
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,690
Scott: If there's no air, you can't make any sound, right?

887
00:45:22,811 --> 00:45:24,883
Scott: Or you need something to vibrate, even if it's not air.

888
00:45:24,903 --> 00:45:26,110
Scott: You need some sort of medium.

889
00:45:26,371 --> 00:45:26,727
Scott: But regardless.

890
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:28,374
Rym: And we won't just talk about air.

891
00:45:28,535 --> 00:45:32,090
Rym: I've had microphones that are not designed to detect air.

892
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:33,373
Rym: Yeah.

893
00:45:33,434 --> 00:45:38,930
Scott: But most of the time with humans talking or noise making with instruments, it's air that's vibrating.

894
00:45:39,211 --> 00:45:40,154
Scott: You want to capture it.

895
00:45:40,174 --> 00:45:42,762
Scott: You want to detect how the air is vibrating.

896
00:45:42,802 --> 00:45:45,530
Scott: What frequency, what amplitude, right?

897
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:48,625
Scott: And then you want to sort of record that with electricity.

898
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:49,469
Scott: It just so happens we're lucky.

899
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:50,957
Rym: Well, it didn't actually have to be electricity.

900
00:45:51,219 --> 00:45:53,270
Rym: There are completely mechanical microphones.

901
00:45:53,371 --> 00:45:54,147
Scott: I'm sure there are.

902
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:56,470
Scott: That have... But most of the time it's electricity.

903
00:45:56,810 --> 00:46:04,330
Rym: Well, but there are microphones that will detect the vibrating air and stencil it directly into something like a wax cylinder or a record.

904
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:04,889
Scott: That's cool.

905
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:07,993
Rym: Yeah, that can exist because it's not even turned into electricity.

906
00:46:08,053 --> 00:46:08,654
Rym: It's just.

907
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:15,040
Rym: Can you record vibration and store a record of that vibration somewhere?

908
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:24,410
Scott: Yeah, I mean, we've heard about like archaeologists, like taking old pottery and like dragging needles on it because the vibrations of people talking way, way, way, way back.

909
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:26,129
Rym: Theoretically be captured there.

910
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:31,230
Scott: Theoretically had been just been captured because the movements of the air hitting the pottery while it was being made.

911
00:46:31,651 --> 00:46:36,810
Scott: So you heard what the maybe the noises that were being made when the pottery was being made.

912
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:37,151
Rym: Yeah.

913
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,008
Rym: In practice, it seemed like that didn't work out.

914
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:40,190
Scott: Regardless.

915
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:41,929
Rym: It's a good idea, but it didn't work out.

916
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:42,231
Rym: Right.

917
00:46:42,573 --> 00:46:45,090
Scott: You just need to capture the vibration.

918
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:50,270
Scott: So what you do is you have some sort of thing that is so light.

919
00:46:51,012 --> 00:46:51,335
Scott: Right.

920
00:46:51,659 --> 00:46:52,750
Scott: That it will vibrate.

921
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:55,470
Rym: Or so big, like it just has to, it has to react.

922
00:46:55,711 --> 00:46:57,344
Scott: The air, the air will push it.

923
00:46:58,029 --> 00:46:58,210
Scott: Right.

924
00:46:58,751 --> 00:47:01,689
Scott: And then modern times you put a fucking magnet on there.

925
00:47:02,231 --> 00:47:04,530
Rym: Well, actually, that already gets complicated.

926
00:47:05,732 --> 00:47:06,356
Rym: But think of it this way.

927
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:08,730
Rym: Really, all the microphone is a transducer in the end.

928
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:16,770
Rym: All it's doing is converting one form of energy to another form of energy, taking vibration and turning it into something else, some kind of signal.

929
00:47:17,592 --> 00:47:19,570
Rym: So really, that's just a transducer.

930
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:23,010
Rym: There's a lot of ways to make transducers to detect vibrations.

931
00:47:24,871 --> 00:47:30,410
Rym: I'm going to not really talk about all the historic kinds of microphones because they're just so obsolete.

932
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:31,613
Rym: It doesn't matter.

933
00:47:32,496 --> 00:47:36,210
Rym: Unless you're a nerd who really is interested in this stuff, it is not helpful information.

934
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:42,150
Rym: But basically, modern microphones are either condenser microphones, electrodes, which are actually condensers.

935
00:47:43,051 --> 00:47:44,662
Rym: They're just a different kind of condenser.

936
00:47:44,682 --> 00:47:45,790
Rym: The details are kind of nuanced.

937
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:49,930
Rym: Carbon microphones, which are known as cheap as shit, piece of shit microphones.

938
00:47:50,792 --> 00:47:53,429
Rym: There's dynamic mics, which are what a lot of microphones are.

939
00:47:54,170 --> 00:48:00,730
Rym: And then there's kind of crazy, like the more specialized stuff like contact microphones and RF microphones.

940
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,882
Rym: And then the really crazy stuff like laser microphones.

941
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,650
Rym: Don't really need to talk about those that much either.

942
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:13,350
Rym: But in terms of you, any microphone and any device you have that's like a phone is probably just an electric condenser.

943
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:19,130
Rym: Fancy microphones tend to be either dynamic or condenser.

944
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:21,879
Rym: The fancier microphones tend to be condenser.

945
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,450
Rym: But yeah, it doesn't really matter for most people.

946
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:34,370
Rym: Condenser microphones really aren't better unless signal quality matters a lot to you and other factors we can get into.

947
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:40,730
Rym: But the way these all basically work, like to talk about all the differences, a dynamic microphone is pretty easy.

948
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:42,429
Rym: It's basically the magnet thing, like Scott said.

949
00:48:42,911 --> 00:48:49,430
Rym: Have some sort of diaphragm, have some magnetic stuff and just calculate air velocity rather like and use that.

950
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:53,510
Scott: When the magnets move in relation to each other and metal, right, there is a current.

951
00:48:53,911 --> 00:48:57,390
Scott: It's a really weak current because it's kind of, you know, it's not like a giant magnet.

952
00:48:57,571 --> 00:48:57,792
Scott: Right.

953
00:48:58,033 --> 00:49:01,710
Scott: But that weak current is enough, you know, and it's analog.

954
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:11,050
Scott: So the vibrate, the movement of the magnet, the change in voltage in the wire is going to mirror the vibration of the air because the air moving is what's pushing the magnet.

955
00:49:11,411 --> 00:49:20,730
Scott: The signal comes out, you amplify the signal with a preamp or just an amp and now you record that in whatever recording medium of choice.

956
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:22,468
Scott: It could be like a tape or a record.

957
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:24,594
Scott: Let's talk about that.

958
00:49:24,634 --> 00:49:28,930
Rym: This gets into audio stuff that's going to be on microphones, but there's like mic level and line level.

959
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:35,550
Rym: And if you have something that's just playing music, it's playing like at line level, meaning like it is loud enough.

960
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:42,830
Rym: There's a signal that is loud enough to do stuff with, but microphones make extremely weak signals.

961
00:49:43,631 --> 00:49:43,932
Rym: Yep.

962
00:49:44,072 --> 00:49:46,479
Scott: Think about how small a microphone is.

963
00:49:46,499 --> 00:49:50,630
Scott: There's little magnets in there and they're so weak ass that the air.

964
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:51,996
Rym: Well, it's actually a magnetic coil.

965
00:49:52,056 --> 00:49:52,839
Rym: It's an electromagnet.

966
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:55,430
Rym: There's no like a permanent magnet in there.

967
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:57,235
Rym: The point is dynamic microphone.

968
00:49:57,295 --> 00:50:02,130
Scott: The point is they're light enough that air is physically pushing them around.

969
00:50:02,772 --> 00:50:03,094
Scott: Right.

970
00:50:03,456 --> 00:50:04,862
Scott: They're moving when I talk.

971
00:50:04,882 --> 00:50:06,409
Scott: My voice is shaking them.

972
00:50:07,052 --> 00:50:08,820
Scott: And that shaking is making a voltage.

973
00:50:09,282 --> 00:50:11,050
Scott: that's obviously not making a big voltage.

974
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:15,649
Scott: If it was making a big voltage, we could have power plants just by taking people like us who talk too much.

975
00:50:15,953 --> 00:50:16,528
Rym: Which we could.

976
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:21,410
Scott: We could make a power plant where people like us just talk at a wall and generate electricity.

977
00:50:22,291 --> 00:50:22,552
Scott: Right.

978
00:50:22,934 --> 00:50:24,139
Scott: If microphones were better.

979
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,550
Scott: But no, the voltage that comes out is weak ass.

980
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:38,570
Rym: So whenever you hear an audio person on a preamplifier or a mic amplifier, that's just an amplifier that takes the weak ass signal from the microphone and gets it up to line level.

981
00:50:38,892 --> 00:50:41,810
Rym: So it's on the same level as something that is like a normal signal.

982
00:50:42,811 --> 00:50:49,450
Rym: And then on the other side, if you're playing stuff out of a speaker, you usually have an amplifier to drive that speaker to make it as loud as you want it to be.

983
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:54,390
Rym: Because usually you want a speaker like in a stadium to be really loud compared to my voice.

984
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:55,848
Scott: I want the speaker to be louder than me.

985
00:50:56,131 --> 00:50:56,272
Scott: Right.

986
00:50:56,292 --> 00:50:58,730
Scott: Because even a signal that's at line level, right?

987
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:05,710
Scott: If I got like a normal tiny speaker or some headphones, line level's probably enough to shake the speakers in the headphones.

988
00:51:05,852 --> 00:51:06,730
Scott: Yeah, tiny little speaker.

989
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:15,010
Scott: If I'm in a stadium or I'm a DJ and I got a giant speaker, I need some, I can't, it might take a line level signal and send it to the speaker.

990
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:16,050
Scott: That ain't shaking shit.

991
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:16,357
Scott: Yup.

992
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:16,833
Scott: Right?

993
00:51:16,934 --> 00:51:17,461
Scott: It's not shaking.

994
00:51:17,502 --> 00:51:17,968
Scott: no booties.

995
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:21,450
Scott: You gotta get big amps and a big stack, right?

996
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:23,928
Scott: Power that shit up and then you go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

997
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:24,411
Scott: Right?

998
00:51:24,753 --> 00:51:25,737
Scott: You need big electricity.

999
00:51:25,777 --> 00:51:28,830
Scott: Because the speaker, usually speakers aren't powered.

1000
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:29,771
Scott: Right?

1001
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:30,821
Scott: They don't have their own battery.

1002
00:51:30,841 --> 00:51:31,810
Scott: They don't plug into the wall.

1003
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:35,809
Scott: They just have speaker wire going into them and all the amplification happens somewhere else.

1004
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:36,250
Rym: Yup.

1005
00:51:36,832 --> 00:51:42,828
Rym: So dynamic mics are like basic, like a microphone you see on a stage is probably an SM58.

1006
00:51:45,111 --> 00:51:50,628
Scott: The metal like mesh ball on a thing you hold, that's what that is.

1007
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:51,531
Rym: Yup.

1008
00:51:52,092 --> 00:51:59,788
Rym: So dynamic mics, a lot of people who are podcasting or something or doing anything, they feel like, "Oh, but I need a condenser because they're much more expensive.

1009
00:51:59,808 --> 00:52:00,209
Rym: They must be

1010
00:52:00,229 --> 00:52:00,450
Rym: better.".

1011
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:00,618
Rym: Meh.

1012
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:01,973
Rym: And they are better.

1013
00:52:02,013 --> 00:52:03,096
Rym: We use condensers now.

1014
00:52:03,337 --> 00:52:03,959
Rym: We used to not.

1015
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:07,670
Rym: But dynamic mics actually have a lot of benefits.

1016
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:12,590
Rym: One, the difference in quality probably does not matter to you or most people.

1017
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:13,729
Scott: You probably would never notice.

1018
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:23,550
Rym: Two, dynamic mics are better in situations where the volume, like the actual objective volume of the sound could get crazy loud.

1019
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:25,969
Rym: Dynamic mics basically can't get blown out.

1020
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:30,797
Rym: They're just invincible and their gain before feedback is really high.

1021
00:52:30,857 --> 00:52:38,570
Rym: so they can take in a crazy high signal, meaning you wouldn't even need to pre-amplify it that much before they start to fuck up.

1022
00:52:39,332 --> 00:52:45,790
Rym: I'm skipping a lot of details because they're not that relevant, but that's basically that normal microphones on like a stage are dynamic microphones.

1023
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:50,036
Rym: Condenser microphones are the so-called fancy ones.

1024
00:52:50,638 --> 00:52:51,620
Rym: They're a little different.

1025
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,243
Rym: They use a capacitor.

1026
00:52:53,744 --> 00:52:55,848
Rym: You want to know why they're called condenser microphones?

1027
00:52:56,369 --> 00:52:56,810
Rym: Do you know why?

1028
00:52:58,270 --> 00:52:59,724
Scott: It's not condensation from the air.

1029
00:53:00,148 --> 00:53:00,229
Scott: Why?

1030
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:03,442
Rym: Capacitors were originally called condensers.

1031
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:04,265
Rym: That's all.

1032
00:53:04,505 --> 00:53:05,750
Rym: They're just capacitor microphones.

1033
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:16,670
Rym: So instead of like a coil and a thing moving, which may or may not be a permanent magnet depending on the kind of microphone, like dynamic, there's all different ways to do this, then that'll make the signal.

1034
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:18,614
Rym: Condensers are much more sensitive.

1035
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:25,110
Rym: It's basically tiny elements moving and changing the capacitance of those elements.

1036
00:53:25,671 --> 00:53:26,330
Scott: Ah, mmm.

1037
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:26,907
Rym: That's how they work.

1038
00:53:28,012 --> 00:53:30,090
Rym: That means you need a power source.

1039
00:53:30,491 --> 00:53:32,970
Scott: Yeah, otherwise that capacitor just drains right out.

1040
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,530
Rym: Yep, dynamic mic sort of powers itself.

1041
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:37,838
Scott: Yeah, because like I said, there's magnets, right?

1042
00:53:37,878 --> 00:53:40,550
Scott: Magnets moving just makes electricity, right?

1043
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:48,868
Scott: The same way that if you crank, if you take a motor and turn it with your hands, right, voltage will come out the other end, and then if you put voltage in, then the motor will spin.

1044
00:53:48,888 --> 00:53:49,990
Scott: It works in both directions.

1045
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:52,174
Scott: This is the same thing, right?

1046
00:53:52,234 --> 00:53:54,598
Scott: Moving the magnets makes electricity, right?

1047
00:53:54,918 --> 00:54:01,970
Scott: Making electricity moves the magnets, but if there are no magnets, you're going to need power to fill up the capacitor because it will just drain on its own.

1048
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:04,350
Scott: So there's a thing called the phantom.

1049
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:05,698
Rym: Phantom power.

1050
00:54:05,798 --> 00:54:07,310
Rym: If you see that phantom power button.

1051
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:08,708
Scott: Grab the key and fucking run.

1052
00:54:09,811 --> 00:54:10,389
Scott: That's right.

1053
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:23,264
Rym: All that means is that the thing you're plugging the microphone into is sending some voltage out, like it's sending electricity to the microphone, so the microphone can basically power itself.

1054
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:27,630
Rym: There's some nuance to what that power is used for that I really don't want to get into.

1055
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:32,970
Scott: The point is, if you have a microphone that needs the phantom power, because it has a capacitor in it.

1056
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:34,690
Rym: Meaning it's a condenser microphone.

1057
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:38,409
Scott: And you do not have phantom power, the microphone will not work, right?

1058
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:40,947
Rym: It'll either generate no signal, or...

1059
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:44,630
Scott: It'll be so weak, maybe there's some energy left in the capacitor, who knows?

1060
00:54:45,131 --> 00:54:51,250
Rym: Or depending on the kind of condenser microphone, it's theoretically possible it might generate a signal that's just so small, nothing could detect it.

1061
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:54,690
Scott: It also might get weaker over time if you start using it, because the capacitor will drain.

1062
00:54:55,050 --> 00:55:01,130
Rym: Yeah, it's complicated too, because usually condenser microphones use that voltage both to power themselves and to polarize one of their elements.

1063
00:55:02,471 --> 00:55:12,190
Scott: Regardless, the point is, if you do want to plug it in, you need to find something to plug it into that will give it the phantom power.

1064
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:24,310
Rym: And this is why most people would prefer to use the dynamic microphone, because unless you're doing really professional stuff, I don't think you want to have to have the equipment that can send phantom power to your device.

1065
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:32,190
Scott: Right, you can just take a dynamic microphone, if you've got the right cables, you can shove it in the back of your computer, you can shove it into your iPhone, you can shove it into anything, you've got a microphone hole.

1066
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:37,510
Scott: If you've got the right cables and adapters to plug into the bottom of the microphone, you can connect the dynamic microphone.

1067
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:39,729
Scott: It's gonna work, you're gonna talk, the audio's gonna come out.

1068
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:48,550
Scott: If you've got the condenser microphone, you need to find some kind of device, some audio mixer, amp, something that has phantom power.

1069
00:55:48,811 --> 00:55:55,629
Scott: I have a thing at home, it's made by Shure, it's called the X2U, literally stands for XLR to USB.

1070
00:55:56,570 --> 00:56:09,590
Scott: On one side, it's a little tiny guy, it's just like a little rod, on one side is an XLR connector to connect the microphone, on the other side is USB, the big kind of USB that you use for your printer and stuff.

1071
00:56:10,472 --> 00:56:15,542
Scott: And then, in the middle, there's just some volume knobs, there's actually a little headphone hole.

1072
00:56:15,563 --> 00:56:19,110
Scott: so you can monitor the microphone on its own separately from your computer.

1073
00:56:20,231 --> 00:56:29,688
Scott: But regardless, it takes the USB power, and with a little button, you can say, "Hey, I'm using a condenser mic, take the USB power and use it as phantom power and power the

1074
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:30,189
Scott: microphone.".

1075
00:56:30,652 --> 00:56:30,738
Rym: Yep.

1076
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:36,390
Scott: I think that's the smallest, cheapest thing I know of that you can use to get phantom power.

1077
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:42,210
Rym: A lot of people don't understand phantom power, and a lot of people buy microphones that they can't use because they don't understand this.

1078
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:45,990
Scott: It comes down to your microphone either needs it or it doesn't, and if it needs it, it needs it.

1079
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:52,650
Rym: Now, modern microphones, if you put phantom power down the line, but it's actually a dynamic mic, usually it won't break anything.

1080
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:53,733
Scott: Yeah, you won't even notice.

1081
00:56:54,114 --> 00:56:59,169
Scott: I've had it happen before, it's like, "Yeah, this microphone doesn't need phantom power, but it's on, oh well, you won't even

1082
00:56:59,209 --> 00:56:59,350
Scott: know.".

1083
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:04,850
Rym: That is not true for another type of microphone, the ribbon microphone, which thankfully is just so obsolete, like it doesn't matter anymore.

1084
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:09,750
Scott: That's the old timey radio ones, you see, that no one uses anymore unless they're weird and retro.

1085
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:25,430
Rym: The history of microphones is basically that different technologies came at different times, but some of the technologies, while they were better in many ways, were not easy to produce, or worked, but were shitty, like one we'll get to in a second, the one that's actually in all your phones, like that kind of microphone.

1086
00:57:25,831 --> 00:57:35,730
Rym: So ribbon microphones have a little, tiny, tiny, thin ribbon of metal inside of them, and that's the thing that detects the signal, and they have a whole system around them.

1087
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:37,298
Scott: It sounds like

1088
00:57:37,318 --> 00:57:37,946
Scott: "wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah.".

1089
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:45,426
Rym: Actually, in the olden times, a ribbon microphone was super good compared to all the other types of microphones they could make.

1090
00:57:45,887 --> 00:57:47,030
Rym: It was like the high quality one.

1091
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,656
Scott: But now it sounds like old timey.

1092
00:57:48,916 --> 00:57:52,910
Scott: It wasn't just the recording technology that makes it sound old timey, it was also the microphone.

1093
00:57:53,110 --> 00:58:01,590
Rym: But the problem with ribbon microphones is that that piece of metal is way bigger than you think, and is crazy fragile.

1094
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:04,789
Scott: Well, because it has to be so weak that air moves it.

1095
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:14,945
Rym: Even worse, if you turn on phantom power to an old ribbon microphone, it'll also instantly destroy the very expensive microphone.

1096
00:58:15,586 --> 00:58:18,370
Rym: A too loud sound can ruin a ribbon microphone.

1097
00:58:18,933 --> 00:58:21,326
Rym: Yelling to one that's not designed for yelling?

1098
00:58:21,346 --> 00:58:22,050
Rym: You've just broken it.

1099
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:23,942
Scott: Yeah, you just shake that little piece of metal right off.

1100
00:58:24,506 --> 00:58:24,929
Scott: The end.

1101
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:28,337
Rym: So, there's a subset of condenser microphones.

1102
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:33,090
Rym: Most people don't seem to realize these are condenser microphones, but they're called electrets.

1103
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:36,881
Rym: They're basically a condenser microphone.

1104
00:58:36,901 --> 00:58:37,966
Rym: They were invented in the '60s.

1105
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:38,710
Rym: They're pretty new.

1106
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:47,430
Rym: And they used to be really shitty, because they were very low quality, but over time, the technology got better and better to where this is the kind of microphone that's in everything today.

1107
00:58:47,931 --> 00:58:57,770
Rym: Anything that isn't like a studio mic, anything in a phone, in a portable console, if you have a smartwatch that has a microphone in it, it's almost definitely an electret.

1108
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:02,882
Rym: They're basically just condensers where the polarization is like.

1109
00:59:02,902 --> 00:59:05,730
Rym: they have a pre-permanently polarized thing in there.

1110
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:08,276
Rym: Like an electrically charged ferroelectric material.

1111
00:59:08,536 --> 00:59:09,860
Rym: You can read Wikipedia.

1112
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:13,610
Rym: I don't even understand it that well, because I don't give a shit about electret microphones.

1113
00:59:14,433 --> 00:59:18,730
Scott: Yeah, I mean, they're not... Electret microphones are not usually used for sounding great, right?

1114
00:59:19,552 --> 00:59:21,305
Rym: They're used because they're tiny.

1115
00:59:21,385 --> 00:59:21,970
Scott: Tiny and cheap.

1116
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:24,057
Scott: Tiny, efficient, cheap, right?

1117
00:59:24,117 --> 00:59:24,559
Scott: They work.

1118
00:59:25,764 --> 00:59:26,306
Scott: Durable.

1119
00:59:26,747 --> 00:59:27,370
Scott: Don't think about it.

1120
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:28,973
Scott: They're relatively low.

1121
00:59:29,073 --> 00:59:35,005
Rym: quality is kind of why you can't record anything with good audio on your phone.

1122
00:59:35,746 --> 00:59:37,610
Rym: As much as you might think you can, you really can't.

1123
00:59:39,491 --> 00:59:41,516
Rym: All those other kinds of microphones are really obsolete.

1124
00:59:41,957 --> 00:59:47,410
Rym: Most people, when they think about kinds of microphones, it actually comes down to the idea of the pickup pattern.

1125
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:49,935
Rym: Like, how does the microphone pick up sound?

1126
00:59:49,975 --> 00:59:55,350
Rym: Because if you weren't aware of this, you can design microphones that basically only pick up sound from one direction.

1127
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:58,810
Scott: Well, the pickup pattern isn't always directly related to the type, right?

1128
00:59:59,252 --> 01:00:00,250
Scott: It's completely unrelated.

1129
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:05,550
Scott: You can have different condensers with different patterns, different dynamics with different patterns, a dynamic and a condenser with the same pattern.

1130
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:08,275
Scott: So you can have like a shotgun microphone.

1131
01:00:08,295 --> 01:00:14,810
Scott: You think about you put it on your camera because you're walking around town with your camera interviewing people for the local TV station.

1132
01:00:15,172 --> 01:00:16,076
Scott: So you have a shotgun mic.

1133
01:00:16,117 --> 01:00:18,610
Scott: It's a long stick and you aim it straight at people.

1134
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:20,843
Rym: If you're watching the stream, I'm holding mine up.

1135
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:21,730
Rym: It's like a foot long.

1136
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:30,210
Scott: Right, you aim it at people because you want to hear them talking and you don't want to hear anyone else talking like the crazy hobo who's trying to yell because he sees the news people recording something.

1137
01:00:30,832 --> 01:00:33,860
Scott: You aim it and it picks up that person right in front of you along.

1138
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:34,863
Scott: It's like a long stick.

1139
01:00:35,184 --> 01:00:35,404
Scott: It's like.

1140
01:00:35,545 --> 01:00:36,607
Scott: that's why it's called a shotgun.

1141
01:00:36,628 --> 01:00:37,390
Scott: It kind of makes sense.

1142
01:00:38,231 --> 01:00:41,744
Scott: And you could have a dynamic shotgun or condenser shotgun or I don't know.

1143
01:00:42,045 --> 01:00:42,266
Scott: Right.

1144
01:00:42,648 --> 01:00:43,230
Scott: It doesn't matter.

1145
01:00:43,771 --> 01:00:43,971
Scott: It's the.

1146
01:00:43,991 --> 01:00:48,239
Scott: it's where it's the shape of the microphone and the shape of where does it?

1147
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:53,490
Scott: a part capsule that you part of it that you aim and then how far away does it pick up.

1148
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:59,288
Scott: It's like a three dimensional shape that comes out of the microphone and it's like any noise in that zone.

1149
01:00:59,308 --> 01:00:59,890
Scott: Right.

1150
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:08,790
Scott: That is moving in this direction will be picked up by the microphone and air moving outside that zone will not hit the microphone and will not be heard and recorded.

1151
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:21,390
Rym: Now, if you're curious how this works, because this is purely physical, this is using physics and the shape of the thing around the actual microphone element to block sound from a direction.

1152
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:21,771
Rym: Right.

1153
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,717
Rym: So that isn't even that complicated.

1154
01:01:23,757 --> 01:01:23,897
Scott: Right.

1155
01:01:23,917 --> 01:01:25,381
Scott: Like it is a microphone I'm using right here.

1156
01:01:25,462 --> 01:01:28,370
Scott: If I try to talk into it from the side, you just disappear.

1157
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:28,770
Rym: Right.

1158
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:30,892
Scott: It's like you can probably still hear me, but probably not much.

1159
01:01:31,272 --> 01:01:38,678
Rym: And if I come around to the frame all the way around to the back, like 180 degrees more so than if you were back here.

1160
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:45,368
Rym: And the reason for that is because we're these microphones are Beta 87 A's.

1161
01:01:45,388 --> 01:01:46,109
Rym: They're condensers.

1162
01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:51,540
Rym: They're sure, but they're hypercardioids, which is a tight type of pickup pattern.

1163
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:54,143
Rym: But the math basically comes down to interference patterns.

1164
01:01:54,203 --> 01:02:06,620
Rym: So like, you know, if I play a sound and then I play the inverse of that sound, like the exact same sound, but I invert the phase, meaning like if it's a sine wave going up and down and up, like up, down, up, down.

1165
01:02:07,001 --> 01:02:08,806
Rym: And I play the exact same sound, but I flip it over.

1166
01:02:08,846 --> 01:02:09,769
Rym: So it's down, up, down, up.

1167
01:02:10,953 --> 01:02:13,380
Rym: Sound waves interfere with each other in the real world.

1168
01:02:13,681 --> 01:02:19,720
Rym: So if two sound waves that are the exact opposite are happening at the same time, they cancel each other out and you hear nothing.

1169
01:02:19,921 --> 01:02:20,142
Rym: Right.

1170
01:02:20,202 --> 01:02:24,140
Scott: It's like if I'm pulling the tug of war to the right, you pull left, the rope doesn't move.

1171
01:02:24,362 --> 01:02:25,520
Rym: But there are still forces.

1172
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:35,100
Scott: If I shake the air with a wave and you shake the air with the exact opposite wave, then when that part of the pool where the waves in the water meet is a still water.

1173
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:35,480
Rym: Yep.

1174
01:02:35,981 --> 01:02:40,771
Rym: So active sound cancellation, like in fancy headphones, that's what they're doing.

1175
01:02:40,812 --> 01:02:42,134
Rym: It's generating sound.

1176
01:02:42,174 --> 01:02:44,840
Rym: That's the inverted phase of the background noise.

1177
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:51,440
Scott: Intentionally looking at the waves coming in the pool and intentionally making the opposite wave to force there to be still water.

1178
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:52,386
Rym: Yep.

1179
01:02:52,406 --> 01:02:53,520
Rym: That's pretty cool.

1180
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:54,100
Scott: Right.

1181
01:02:54,120 --> 01:03:02,920
Scott: Imagine if like you could, you know, it's like you could never do it with your hand, but like splashing the water in the pool so fastly and precisely to force the water to be still.

1182
01:03:03,148 --> 01:03:03,359
Rym: Yep.

1183
01:03:03,865 --> 01:03:04,538
Scott: That's what's going on.

1184
01:03:04,801 --> 01:03:07,899
Rym: So the shape of the microphone determines this.

1185
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:12,640
Rym: And even though I understand them, this is one area of math, I actually do understand it pretty well.

1186
01:03:13,162 --> 01:03:15,160
Rym: Without drawing it, it's really hard to explain this.

1187
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,740
Scott: It's also three dimensional and all the illustrations everywhere will always be two dimensional.

1188
01:03:19,321 --> 01:03:21,860
Scott: Maybe a YouTube video could show you some 3D explanations.

1189
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:26,400
Rym: But a lot of people get confused about when and how to use these different patterns.

1190
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,025
Rym: And this is something generally.

1191
01:03:28,246 --> 01:03:31,940
Rym: there's two kinds of microphones, directional or omni-directional.

1192
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:35,417
Rym: An omni-microphone means it picks up sound equally in all directions.

1193
01:03:35,497 --> 01:03:35,980
Rym: It just works.

1194
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:42,940
Rym: Any time you do something to make a microphone more directional, you also color the sound.

1195
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:46,614
Rym: You're changing the signal that's coming in because you're fucking with it.

1196
01:03:46,654 --> 01:03:48,080
Rym: Like you're making the audio go through all these paths.

1197
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,078
Rym: You're canceling things out.

1198
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:54,180
Rym: So if a microphone is omni-directional, it'll pick up sound from all directions.

1199
01:03:54,663 --> 01:03:57,000
Rym: But sometimes, in fact, most times you want that.

1200
01:03:57,381 --> 01:04:05,700
Rym: If you can get away with it, you always want to use an omni-directional microphone because you'll get the purest possible representation of the actual sound at that point in space.

1201
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:16,880
Rym: So an omni-directional microphone that's closer to the sound source will be better than a directional microphone that's further away from the same source.

1202
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:20,180
Scott: The problem with omni-directional is sometimes you're recording sounds.

1203
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:26,180
Scott: And like I said with shotgun microphone, you don't want to record every sound that hits that point in space.

1204
01:04:26,301 --> 01:04:27,968
Scott: It's like we've got two people talking.

1205
01:04:28,028 --> 01:04:30,720
Scott: We don't want to record anything else except the two people talking.

1206
01:04:31,101 --> 01:04:33,920
Scott: We don't want the birds tweeting and the grass blowing.

1207
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:40,700
Rym: This room we're recording nights because I only have two bedrooms is not a full sound stage.

1208
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:43,072
Rym: I don't have acoustic foam covering every surface.

1209
01:04:43,334 --> 01:04:44,500
Rym: There's a lot of echo in this room.

1210
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:46,317
Scott: There could be noises coming from outside like the 7 train.

1211
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:46,981
Rym: Yep.

1212
01:04:47,001 --> 01:04:48,409
Rym: Scott and I are also very loud.

1213
01:04:48,429 --> 01:04:50,239
Rym: We're just yelling into microphones for an hour.

1214
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:53,272
Rym: And I need to make sure his mic doesn't pick me up and vice versa.

1215
01:04:53,594 --> 01:04:54,800
Rym: so these hyper-cardioids...

1216
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:55,739
Scott: They're not in separate rooms.

1217
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,660
Rym: The pickup pattern on these is very specific.

1218
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:03,110
Rym: And if you buy fancy microphones with directional patterns, they come with a template.

1219
01:05:03,311 --> 01:05:07,100
Rym: you can put over the microphone to figure out where to put other sound sources.

1220
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:15,380
Rym: Because the sound they pick up the least is like 270 degree angle and the inverse of that out the back.

1221
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:24,160
Rym: Because on a stage you stand on the X and you put the monitor speakers pointed at you so you can hear your band and yourself pointed at the microphone from those angles.

1222
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:30,320
Rym: So the microphone will pick you up and it'll pick the crowd up a tiny bit but it won't pick up those two specific speakers.

1223
01:05:31,041 --> 01:05:33,270
Rym: Like that's how cool this shit can get.

1224
01:05:34,093 --> 01:05:35,740
Rym: But it colors the sound.

1225
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,767
Rym: So you know how people talk about a radio voice?

1226
01:05:38,631 --> 01:05:40,480
Rym: That's caused by that pickup pattern.

1227
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:45,460
Rym: The closer you get to a microphone that is directional, the more you'll pick up bass.

1228
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,470
Rym: Like bass gets physically amplified.

1229
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:51,180
Rym: My voice will get deeper the closer I get to this thing.

1230
01:05:52,382 --> 01:05:54,199
Scott: Also you intentionally talk deeper just then.

1231
01:05:55,264 --> 01:05:56,080
Rym: That was not intentional.

1232
01:05:56,787 --> 01:05:57,340
Scott: You did it though.

1233
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,840
Rym: Even if I talk really high though it'll still be deeper than if I do it back here.

1234
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:01,420
Scott: That's true.

1235
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:08,940
Rym: So radio people, depending on what you're doing, maybe you want to get someone's natural voice.

1236
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,809
Rym: Then you want to use an omnidirectional mic.

1237
01:06:11,151 --> 01:06:12,580
Rym: Maybe you want to sound like Barry Manilow.

1238
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:16,378
Rym: You get a fucking shotgun mic and you like swallow it and talk into it.

1239
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:26,080
Rym: So shotgun mics are just really really really really directional microphones.

1240
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:43,699
Rym: That long length and all those vents on the side is just to pick up reflections and route audio around to where sound that comes in from the sides, well not from the direct sides but from like any sound you don't want to pick up, is generally going to be reflected internally such that it cancels itself out.

1241
01:06:45,521 --> 01:06:48,840
Rym: So because of math and physics you can't actually do that for all sounds.

1242
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:54,960
Rym: So the pickup patterns are actually way more complex than these images I'm showing you because they also are different at every frequency.

1243
01:06:56,581 --> 01:07:01,040
Rym: So that's the complication and this is the stuff you have to learn if you use microphones for serious.

1244
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:08,920
Scott: Right well because you might have, you know, if you're doing some audio stuff where it matters, you got a whole set of microphones with all sorts of different ones, you get to pick the right one for the right job.

1245
01:07:09,964 --> 01:07:13,680
Scott: But you know you're making a movie or something or recording a band, it's like you got to know that stuff.

1246
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:17,640
Scott: But if you're 99% of people using microphones are just talking.

1247
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:24,799
Rym: And in that case you just want to be as close to that microphone as you can and that's fine.

1248
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:29,260
Rym: And then set your gain like the volume so you're not overloading the thing.

1249
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:36,840
Scott: Yeah I think most people are just using, you know, the ones in their headset or the ones in their phone.

1250
01:07:37,422 --> 01:07:42,100
Rym: I have never found a headset that had a microphone that was even like worth talking about.

1251
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,799
Scott: They're so bad.

1252
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:44,760
Scott: Right the strategy.

1253
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:52,679
Rym: When I play like Overwatch if I wear this just because that's what I'm talking to like the team with, I'll record my voice with a different microphone if I'm streaming for the rest of you.

1254
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:53,900
Scott: This is my recommendation.

1255
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:57,540
Scott: You know they sell gaming headsets and stuff like that to people.

1256
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,980
Scott: They're pretty much all a bad idea.

1257
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:03,320
Rym: You're better off buying headphones and a microphone.

1258
01:08:03,401 --> 01:08:05,980
Scott: Yes if you go online and be like what's the best gaming headset?

1259
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:12,140
Scott: Pretty much everyone who knows anything says buy headphones because you can get really good headphones really cheap.

1260
01:08:12,662 --> 01:08:13,708
Scott: And then buy a microphone.

1261
01:08:13,728 --> 01:08:15,540
Scott: you can get a pretty good microphone pretty cheap.

1262
01:08:16,121 --> 01:08:21,020
Scott: And that's cheaper than a gaming headset which is shitty headphones attached to a shitty microphone and a bunch of gaming garbage.

1263
01:08:21,921 --> 01:08:28,580
Scott: The only time you should buy like a headset that has the microphone and the ear thing is like let's say you're a salesperson who's on the phone all day.

1264
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:31,160
Scott: Then it's like well the audio quality doesn't really matter.

1265
01:08:31,381 --> 01:08:34,060
Scott: The hands-freeness is what matters right?

1266
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:37,020
Scott: You know then the not hassle of having two things is what matters.

1267
01:08:37,743 --> 01:08:39,479
Scott: Other than that headsets no bueno.

1268
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,279
Rym: So volume wise I think we're not gonna get too deep in this.

1269
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:45,102
Rym: We've gone long enough.

1270
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:51,740
Rym: but in terms of what you do with the audio the last thing we should talk about is dynamic mics.

1271
01:08:51,979 --> 01:08:52,725
Rym: You generally don't like.

1272
01:08:52,745 --> 01:08:55,140
Rym: you don't get so loud that the microphone distorts you.

1273
01:08:55,801 --> 01:09:03,680
Rym: Usually it's the thing you're putting the signal into does not have the ability to capture the signal that you're putting into it.

1274
01:09:04,423 --> 01:09:05,839
Rym: That's what clipping is.

1275
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:07,383
Rym: We live in a digital world.

1276
01:09:07,783 --> 01:09:14,660
Rym: analog clipping exists but it turns into a different kind of distortion that sucks but doesn't suck as much as digital distortion.

1277
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:15,444
Scott: And we're not a metal band.

1278
01:09:15,465 --> 01:09:17,939
Scott: we're not going for intentional distortion right?

1279
01:09:18,261 --> 01:09:23,540
Rym: But basically however whatever microphone you're using whatever thing you're putting that signal into.

1280
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:30,819
Rym: You want to make sure that the loudest sound you intend to put into it will not go above whatever red line your software has.

1281
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:35,000
Rym: Because that is clipping and that's where literally the signal will not be processed.

1282
01:09:35,901 --> 01:09:41,200
Rym: If you record something and look at it in some software you'll see these like flat tops on the waves.

1283
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:42,546
Scott: Right you think about a wave right?

1284
01:09:42,808 --> 01:09:44,700
Scott: The air is moving when I'm talking right?

1285
01:09:44,779 --> 01:09:45,582
Scott: It's a wave.

1286
01:09:45,643 --> 01:09:51,140
Scott: it's nice and you know regardless of what frequencies are in the wave it is you know up and down.

1287
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:52,399
Scott: It has you know an amplitude.

1288
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:54,260
Rym: But there's no maximum volume.

1289
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,040
Scott: No I could get louder and louder and louder and louder until your eardrums break.

1290
01:09:58,180 --> 01:09:59,887
Scott: You might not be able to hear all the sounds.

1291
01:10:00,449 --> 01:10:03,119
Scott: maybe a dog can hear more of them but they're there.

1292
01:10:04,461 --> 01:10:06,325
Rym: In air there is an upper limit.

1293
01:10:06,586 --> 01:10:10,694
Rym: there you could have a sound so loud that it causes nuclear fusion.

1294
01:10:14,165 --> 01:10:14,569
Scott: That's true too.

1295
01:10:14,589 --> 01:10:15,700
Scott: That could theoretically happen.

1296
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:18,160
Scott: You could also just blast all the air away so there's no air left.

1297
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,840
Rym: Yep you get one big sound and then nothing.

1298
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:28,960
Scott: Right but regardless of those ideas right there's not a lot of limit to how much and you know to what frequencies and how hard and fast.

1299
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:32,097
Scott: I guess the air molecule can't move faster than the speed of light.

1300
01:10:32,117 --> 01:10:32,640
Scott: that's your limit.

1301
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:40,500
Rym: So if you're recording to a physical medium like a record you can only stick the needle so deep into the vinyl before you go through it.

1302
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:49,540
Rym: Yep and if you make your tolerances such that the loudest sound you could possibly record on earth will go as deep as you can go.

1303
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:53,880
Rym: Then most of the sounds you're going to record will be so quiet they won't even scratch the record.

1304
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:58,487
Scott: Right and if you have a computer recording the noise digitally you know you can only have it.

1305
01:10:58,507 --> 01:11:02,153
Scott: you know it's like how often am I going to write down onto this data?

1306
01:11:02,413 --> 01:11:06,239
Scott: right with bits zeros and ones the amplitude at a given point in time?

1307
01:11:06,359 --> 01:11:06,580
Scott: right.

1308
01:11:06,941 --> 01:11:10,774
Rym: The frequency is how often and the number of bits is how much?

1309
01:11:11,095 --> 01:11:12,580
Rym: how many gradations can you store.

1310
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:13,181
Scott: Right it's only.

1311
01:11:13,221 --> 01:11:14,062
Scott: it's like just same things.

1312
01:11:14,082 --> 01:11:15,344
Scott: look at a high resolution image.

1313
01:11:15,405 --> 01:11:17,188
Scott: it's like I can use 64 bits.

1314
01:11:17,548 --> 01:11:20,794
Scott: I can write down a thousand bits.

1315
01:11:20,794 --> 01:11:24,200
Scott: 20,000 billion bits per microsecond right is a limit.

1316
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:26,162
Scott: And that number of bits it's like.

1317
01:11:26,182 --> 01:11:28,386
Scott: well that's how many amplitudes I can represent.

1318
01:11:28,747 --> 01:11:30,750
Scott: if there's a sound that's even louder.

1319
01:11:31,011 --> 01:11:33,194
Scott: where I'm already I already wrote down all ones.

1320
01:11:33,575 --> 01:11:36,700
Scott: all ones is my loudest possible highest possible amplitude.

1321
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:39,320
Scott: So what happens if a louder sound comes in than all ones?

1322
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:40,562
Scott: A louder sound appears.

1323
01:11:40,923 --> 01:11:46,273
Scott: all I can do is write down all ones and you're just gonna hear even though there's a noise happening.

1324
01:11:46,313 --> 01:11:48,376
Scott: it's just gonna be the loudest possible.

1325
01:11:48,437 --> 01:11:50,240
Scott: constant noise is the flat ones.

1326
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,962
Rym: Yep and even worse.

1327
01:11:52,062 --> 01:11:53,664
Rym: and the last point because we've gone long enough.

1328
01:11:55,366 --> 01:12:07,420
Rym: if you have more than one microphone and you record with all of them at the same time they could all the things you recorded could interfere with each other in a way that it didn't interfere in the real world.

1329
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:11,580
Rym: Because you're well for reasons that we're out of time we've gone way over an hour.

1330
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:13,618
Rym: That was an okay show I think.

1331
01:12:19,792 --> 01:12:22,057
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1332
01:12:22,098 --> 01:12:27,090
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1333
01:12:27,470 --> 01:12:32,490
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1334
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:35,437
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows.

1335
01:12:35,557 --> 01:12:40,150
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1336
01:12:40,511 --> 01:12:43,666
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1337
01:12:45,010 --> 01:12:48,020
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1338
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:51,130
Scott: But unlike those other late shows it's actually recorded at night.

1339
01:13:02,563 --> 01:13:38,660
Rym: And the Patreon Patrons for this episode of GeekNights are... Ryan from New Zealand, Ryan Perrin, Dropenlander, Finn, Dread Lily Tenebrae, Sean Klein, Chris Reimer, Thomas Hahn.

1340
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:48,700
Rym: And now here's something that thanks to the Comedy Central television station when I was young is burned into my very soul.

1341
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,051
Rym: I leave you with...

1342
01:14:33,401 --> 01:14:33,841
Scott: My lady.

1343
01:14:33,921 --> 01:14:35,563
Rym: she went downtown.

1344
01:14:38,166 --> 01:14:42,191
Rym: She bought some broccoli.

1345
01:14:47,678 --> 01:14:49,280
Scott: She running home.

1346
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,941
Scott: She's jumping broccoli.

1347
01:15:01,961 --> 01:15:04,504
Rym: Jumping broccoli.

1348
01:15:05,766 --> 01:15:06,927
Rym: Jumping broccoli.

1349
01:15:08,129 --> 01:15:10,391
Rym: Jumping broccoli.

1350
01:15:10,411 --> 01:15:11,533
Scott: Jumping broccoli.

1351
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,481
Rym: She jumping broccoli.

1352
01:15:28,241 --> 01:15:41,066
Rym: Jumping, she jumping, she jumping, she jumping, she jumping, she jumping, she jumping, she jumping, she jumping, she jumping, she jumping, she jumping, she jumping broccoli.

1353
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:55,237
Scott: Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
