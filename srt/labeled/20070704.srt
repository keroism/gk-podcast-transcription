1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:16,479
Scott: Well, for those of you who do not live in the United States or are unfamiliar with the ways of the United States and the history of the United States, well, we live there and today is July 4th and the Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4th.

2
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:17,920
Rym: Take that, Albion.

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:20,578
Rym: Give or take.

4
00:00:21,102 --> 00:00:21,231
Scott: Yes.

5
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:30,374
Scott: So, on July 4th, we don't have to go to work, we don't have to do anything, and usually there's a bunch of fireworks, but...

6
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,460
Rym: It's been raining continuously for the last four hours.

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,340
Scott: And fireworks don't work in the rain because they need fire, not water.

8
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,440
Scott: That's why they're fireworks.

9
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,660
Scott: They work with fire.

10
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,920
Scott: They're not waterworks, which work with water.

11
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:51,020
Rym: Also, while there are fireworks that would work just fine in the rain, the issue is more that there's not going to be anyone sitting outside in the rain to watch them.

12
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:51,980
Scott: That's also true.

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:01:00,940
Scott: So, we don't really feel like doing a full show because we're having a day of relaxing and whatever, but we can't do no show because we're too awesome for that.

14
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,900
Rym: See, normally, we'd be on the beach right now.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,040
Rym: The problem is, in America, we're generally pretty practical about our vacations and our holidays.

16
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:14,760
Rym: So, if a holiday falls on a Thursday, we tend to move it to the Friday so we can have the three-day weekend.

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,380
Scott: Yeah, Memorial Day is always a Monday, so that way we always take three-day weekend.

18
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,463
Scott: You don't have this.

19
00:01:22,086 --> 00:01:25,960
Scott: go to work Monday, get off Tuesday, then go to work Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

20
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:26,779
Scott: That just doesn't happen.

21
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,675
Scott: It doesn't happen.

22
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,400
Rym: But, you might notice, tonight's Wednesday.

23
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,820
Rym: They couldn't really move it in either direction.

24
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:40,860
Rym: They just kept it on Wednesday, and as a result, the majority of Americans went to work for two days, took today off, and are going to go to work for two more days.

25
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:46,555
Scott: Actually, a lot of people just took vacation to get the five-day weekend or- I was gonna.

26
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:54,260
Scott: They went on super vacation all week because now they can spend one less vacation day and still get the whole nine-day vacation.

27
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:03,719
Rym: If you want a min-max, you gotta take the Monday, Tuesday, or the Thursday, Friday off because then, for the price of two vacation days, you get a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday off.

28
00:02:04,143 --> 00:02:04,260
Scott: Yep.

29
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,460
Scott: But we didn't do that because we're using our vacation days for the Otakans, so- And our writer's retreat.

30
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:10,887
Scott: Yep.

31
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,739
Scott: So, it's just, you know, middle of the week, day off, nothing to do, so we're gonna do a special episode of GeekNights.

32
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,860
Rym: Now, special has special connotations when it comes to us.

33
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,260
Rym: We haven't done one in a while, so we figure we should explain it, especially since we have a lot of new people, a lot of new faces in the forums.

34
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:31,433
Scott: If this is your first time listening to GeekNights, this is not a normal episode of GeekNights.

35
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,780
Scott: It does not follow the standard GeekNights format.

36
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:37,600
Scott: It is just us talking for about a half hour about something.

37
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:40,460
Scott: We don't have our usual things of the day.

38
00:02:40,886 --> 00:02:41,799
Scott: We don't have news.

39
00:02:42,201 --> 00:02:52,560
Scott: We don't have anything we usually do, so if you want to get familiar with the show, you should go and listen to some other episode, almost any other episode that does not have the word "special" in the title.

40
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,778
Rym: Yep, pretty much.

41
00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:00,520
Rym: Listen to any Tuesday night show if you want to hear about gaming, Wednesday for anime and all that, but feel free to check out any particular episode.

42
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,079
Rym: It doesn't matter.

43
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,380
Rym: Pick a topic you like.

44
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,119
Scott: And if you're already a GeekNights listener, well, this is all you're getting today, so deal with it.

45
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,020
Rym: Though, there was a lot of anime news, and I really want to talk about it, but I'll save.

46
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:19,140
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of news coming out of the Anime Expo, a whole bunch of licenses, news about Anime Expo itself, all sorts of stuff, but we're not gonna talk about it now.

47
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,120
Scott: We're gonna wait for everything to chill out, and for all the facts to settle, and then we'll talk about it.

48
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,100
Rym: Rest assured, we're gonna have the Anime Expo news extravaganza next week.

49
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,000
Scott: Even though we've never been to Anime Expo, and I don't imagine we'll go there anytime soon.

50
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:42,820
Rym: Well, the thing is, I'll go to Anime Expo if I am going to the West Coast for a con, and I'm already going to PAX and the San Diego Comic Con.

51
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:57,180
Scott: Yeah, and in order for me to go to those, it's like, well, I guess you could go to Anime Expo and San Diego, because they're within the same month, so you could make it one big trip, but that would be so many vacation days to make up the weeks in between the two weekends.

52
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,760
Rym: That's the kind of time when, for me, I just quit my job and then start a new one at the end of the vacation.

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,420
Scott: Yeah, I mean, they're both four-day conventions, right?

54
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:05,639
Scott: So I don't know, it's tough.

55
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:11,139
Scott: You'd have to take the whole month of July off, and then you'd still need the month of August off to go to PAX.

56
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,520
Rym: But if I'm gonna take a month off, I'd rather just go to Turkey or something.

57
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,598
Rym: I'm not gonna go around the US.

58
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:16,160
Rym: Yeah.

59
00:04:17,046 --> 00:04:17,620
Scott: Why Turkey?

60
00:04:18,402 --> 00:04:19,140
Scott: It's sort of random.

61
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,099
Rym: Actually, no, I've been thinking about going to Turkey for some time now.

62
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,938
Rym: I want to see all the old Byzantine stuff.

63
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:35,140
Scott: And that Byzantine emperor guy, the Turkish, like, you know, I guess, whoever, the Turkish Board of Tourism should hire him, because he's encouraging Turkish tourism.

64
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,959
Rym: Well, actually, Emily was telling me that apparently there's been a big push for tourism to Turkey.

65
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:40,360
Scott: They've got some cool stuff there.

66
00:04:40,562 --> 00:04:41,878
Scott: You can get a Turkish shave.

67
00:04:43,982 --> 00:04:47,040
Rym: The thing is, we can go there pretty cheaply, a lot cheaper than we could go to Europe.

68
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,479
Scott: Yeah, but I want to see castles.

69
00:04:49,202 --> 00:04:49,840
Rym: There's castles.

70
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,880
Scott: Yeah, but there are different kinds of castles.

71
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,420
Rym: Yeah, they're better, far superior, much cooler.

72
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,358
Rym: Let's see, let's see.

73
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:02,280
Rym: On one hand, we have the decaying remains of the Roman Empire, one of the greatest empires in the history of humanity.

74
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,500
Scott: We can go see that in Rome.

75
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,780
Rym: It's not the same, because the Byzantines held on, they kept going, and they had the Greek influence.

76
00:05:09,465 --> 00:05:11,459
Scott: We can go to Greece and Athens.

77
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,618
Rym: You realize that most of the original Greek city-states, nothing remains of what was there, just about.

78
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:17,940
Scott: Parthenon.

79
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:18,999
Rym: Yeah, but not so much.

80
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,079
Rym: There's a lot more Byzantine stuff left.

81
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,939
Scott: We can go to Cyprus.

82
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:23,759
Rym: I would like to go to Cyprus.

83
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,359
Scott: We could also go to the Carcassonne.

84
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:33,400
Scott: I'm pretty sure, though, we are not the first people who will play Carcassonne at the Carcassonne.

85
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,300
Scott: However, I think someone has beat us to it.

86
00:05:35,521 --> 00:05:44,040
Rym: While I saw someone took his set of Amun-Re and took a picture of his pharaoh next to the Great Pyramid, I have not seen anyone take pictures of meeples standing in the Carcassonne.

87
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,100
Scott: I'm pretty sure someone's done it, but I haven't seen it yet, but it's got to be done.

88
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:54,520
Rym: I never really knew it was a real specific place until Richard- We should go to Iraq and with our takers and your fraides.

89
00:05:56,203 --> 00:05:57,659
Rym: Yeah, Iraq's the place we want to be.

90
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,033
Rym: Yeah.

91
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:05,820
Rym: You know, actually, as a CS guy and an IT guy, we could spend like six months there and make our annual salary four times over.

92
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:08,000
Rym: And the odds of dying are pretty low.

93
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,219
Scott: They are pretty low, but they're much higher than they are for me right now.

94
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,798
Rym: See, I work in the Bronx, so.

95
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,460
Scott: It's still not even close to Iraq.

96
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:20,760
Scott: Anyway, today for our special episode, we're going to talk about anime marathons.

97
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,380
Rym: You see, we've mentioned offhand all these marathons we've done in the past.

98
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,200
Rym: And we speak of them very highly, but we always kind of offhanded.

99
00:06:28,441 --> 00:06:29,860
Rym: They're like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

100
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,279
Rym: Yeah, like when we marathoned Ava the second time.

101
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,439
Rym: We never really went into detail about that.

102
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:49,360
Scott: Basically, what it comes down to is that anime, traditionally, when you have a Japanese animated TV series, it's serial in that all the episodes go in order and tell one larger story.

103
00:06:49,882 --> 00:06:53,500
Scott: So you want to watch all the episodes in order to get the big picture.

104
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,800
Scott: However, there are 26 almost 30 minute episodes on usually.

105
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:00,860
Scott: I mean, some series are longer, some are shorter.

106
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,840
Scott: You know, some episodes are longer, some are shorter.

107
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:08,879
Scott: But you've got in general, most of the shows are 26 episodes and about almost a half hour per episode.

108
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:15,336
Scott: That means you've got to sit there for 12 hours or so if you want to watch the whole show.

109
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,920
Scott: Now you can watch an episode a day, which is how I watch Macross TV.

110
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,480
Rym: It's how we watch most anime nowadays.

111
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:20,897
Rym: Yeah.

112
00:07:21,301 --> 00:07:23,600
Scott: You can watch episodes as they come out every week.

113
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:24,840
Scott: That's not so bad either.

114
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:33,820
Scott: But if a show is already out on DVD in full, and you have the box set, why not just sit there for 12 hours and watch the whole thing?

115
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,060
Rym: Now the key benefits of this are very simple.

116
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:45,578
Rym: Number one, there's always the problem of, you know, me and Scott have seen this blah blah whatever show, but Alex hasn't.

117
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,059
Rym: So we lend it to Alex, and then all of us have seen it.

118
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,337
Rym: But oh, Pete hasn't seen it.

119
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:53,540
Rym: But maybe Katsu's seen half of it, and Adam's seen the end but not the beginning.

120
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:58,539
Rym: And we have kind of everyone's at a different state, so we can never really talk about the show or anything.

121
00:07:59,281 --> 00:08:03,654
Rym: So as a result, the best thing to do is to get everyone together and watch the show in one shot.

122
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,480
Rym: And then we know you've all seen it all.

123
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,700
Rym: We can talk about it right then.

124
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,960
Scott: Everyone's seen it in order.

125
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,199
Scott: Everyone's seen every episode.

126
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,520
Scott: Nothing's missing.

127
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,254
Scott: You know, it's all good.

128
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:18,620
Rym: Now two is just the fact that watching a show in marathon format is awesome.

129
00:08:18,761 --> 00:08:21,040
Rym: But we'll get into that with a bunch of anecdotal evidence.

130
00:08:21,522 --> 00:08:27,940
Scott: Well, it's watching a show all at once is a very different experience than watching it, you know, in separate pieces.

131
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:47,059
Rym: You start to notice a lot of things like a show like Ava, Ava, for example, if you watch it in its normal format, like once a week or even less often, depending on when the DVDs were coming out or when you were watching it, it's real easy to not notice correlations between subtle things that happened in one episode and subtle related things that happened in another episode.

132
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:55,260
Scott: Yes, like if someone does it, like if there's like a little visual cue or something and it's repeated often, like once per episode or something like that.

133
00:08:55,561 --> 00:08:56,080
Rym: Like a new antenna.

134
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:56,455
Scott: Yeah.

135
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,300
Scott: You won't notice it if you just see it once a week.

136
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:08,380
Scott: Like it's the kind of thing where if you watch an episode of a show and then you wait, you're going to only remember like the, you know, the big things you're going to remember.

137
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:08,700
Scott: Okay.

138
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:09,699
Scott: What happened last time?

139
00:09:09,905 --> 00:09:10,320
Scott: All right.

140
00:09:10,581 --> 00:09:20,340
Scott: That robot fought that robot and that guy died and that spaceship crashed and that you're not going to remember the little details like, oh yeah, it faded to pink and then blue.

141
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:29,160
Scott: And then it made this noise, you know, about halfway through the show or yeah, played that song when that person appeared every time in the background very quietly.

142
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:44,320
Scott: But if you watch the show in a marathon, what ends up happening is you sort of lose something and gain something you don't, what you lose is that the episode, the episodes blur together because you're not allowing the events to sink in after watching them.

143
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:50,511
Scott: It just sort of runs into this one giant epic and you can't really tell where one begins and where one ends.

144
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:50,998
Scott: very well.

145
00:09:51,840 --> 00:10:04,379
Scott: But when there's subtle things that happen very often, you're bombarded with them constantly over these hours and hours, you know, and you go, Hey, I see that all the fricking time that just keeps happening there.

146
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:04,971
Scott: Look at that.

147
00:10:05,741 --> 00:10:10,140
Rym: Plus, I mean, aside from all that meta, it just comes down to, for me watching a show like that.

148
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,520
Rym: I mean, I like to watch an epic, uh, Lord of the Rings.

149
00:10:12,942 --> 00:10:24,420
Rym: I, other than the fact that I don't have enough free time, if my free time itself were not a factor, I would have preferred to just waited and seen all of the Lord of the Rings in one shot at once without having to wait between the movies.

150
00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:29,560
Rym: Uh, I have no problem with watching a four, eight, 12 hour epic in one day.

151
00:10:30,182 --> 00:10:32,680
Scott: Well, it depends on exactly what it is I'm watching.

152
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:42,200
Scott: You know, there are some things where I think because the experience of watching like the same exact thing in marathon form or in separated form is completely different.

153
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:48,660
Scott: It's sort of like if you read a comic book one issue at a time every month, or you just wait for the trade, the experience is completely different.

154
00:10:48,861 --> 00:10:50,840
Rym: It really depends on what kind of anime it is.

155
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,640
Rym: I mean, Ava Eska, a show that has a straight contiguous plot, no filler, and it's just, you know, the plot is progressing continuously.

156
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:01,259
Rym: There's not a lot of recap, nothing like that.

157
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,980
Rym: Those shows are absolutely perfect for a marathon, but they sure are.

158
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,260
Rym: But a show like, I don't know, Lupin the third, not good for a marathon.

159
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,340
Rym: There's no plot.

160
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,420
Rym: It's completely episodic.

161
00:11:11,621 --> 00:11:13,027
Rym: The marathon is just going to fall apart.

162
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:20,280
Rym: or Magic Knight, Gray Earth, which while I like it a little, it's also really long and really repetitive.

163
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,020
Scott: But there are even some shorter shows that aren't good for marathoning.

164
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,340
Scott: You know, it's not just the length.

165
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,740
Scott: I mean, obviously, a show that's too long, like hundreds of episodes.

166
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,940
Rym: No, I also said repetitive.

167
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,540
Scott: Yeah, like One Piece, not good for marathons.

168
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:37,040
Scott: But also, there are some 13 episode shows out there not so good for marathons.

169
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,220
Rym: But then there's like El Hazzard, the original OAV, awesome for marathons.

170
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:53,279
Scott: OAVs are typically always awesome for marathons because they're usually a lot shorter than a 26 episode series, but they also have a contiguous plot over like three or four 45 minute episodes.

171
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,659
Scott: You know, so it's like, oh yeah, gonna rock that.

172
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:05,399
Rym: Now, the reason we brought this up is just that we were thinking a lot about RIT and back in the day, and we remembered that one of our favorite pastimes, and we did this relatively often.

173
00:12:05,842 --> 00:12:16,600
Rym: See, RIT, there were tunnels connecting all the dorms, and on a weekend in the winter when it's cold outside and no one has classes, you could do everything you needed to do for the entire weekend.

174
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:17,580
Scott: Without going outside.

175
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,040
Rym: From Friday morning, because no one had classes on a Friday ever.

176
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:25,020
Rym: I mean, unless you were dumb, I never had a class on a Friday.

177
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:46,951
Rym: But you pretty much from Friday morning until Monday morning, you did not have to set foot outside once, and yet, you could get to restaurants, you could get, well, there wasn't any more, but there used to be a bar over there, the arcades, get your mail, go to all the little grocery stores in the area, we could all meet in the dorms, we could break into one of the office-y areas and play board games, you could

178
00:12:46,971 --> 00:12:48,540
Scott: do all sorts of crazy stuff down there.

179
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:59,519
Rym: So oftentimes, if we were bored, especially freshman year, especially because we were all freshmen at RIT, and we were all into anime, but a lot of us hadn't seen the big name shows.

180
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:11,096
Rym: Like when we realized that a full half the group hadn't seen Escaflowne, or hadn't seen Cowboy Bebop, we say, "Alright, next weekend, starting Saturday morning, we're gonna watch the first half, and then Sunday we're gonna watch the

181
00:13:11,136 --> 00:13:11,358
Rym: rest.".

182
00:13:11,984 --> 00:13:13,579
Scott: And we did exactly that.

183
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,660
Rym: Well, I'd put on the same pair of pajamas and just wear it all weekend long.

184
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,027
Rym: Yep.

185
00:13:18,002 --> 00:13:19,000
Scott: Ah, those were good times.

186
00:13:19,161 --> 00:13:21,060
Scott: Now, I don't have time for that anymore.

187
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,137
Scott: I got podcasts, I got a real job that takes all day, I got all kinds of stuff in no time for marathoning.

188
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,099
Rym: See, there's something really special about it, and you win out even if you've seen the anime before.

189
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:40,520
Rym: Because if you're a newbie and you haven't seen Ava, now you're watching Ava with a whole bunch of people who, one, can answer questions if you really don't understand something.

190
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,294
Rym: Even though the answer is usually, "Watch the

191
00:13:43,335 --> 00:13:43,616
Rym: show.".

192
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,051
Rym: What are you asking me?

193
00:13:45,072 --> 00:13:45,720
Rym: to spoil it for you?

194
00:13:45,821 --> 00:13:46,298
Rym: Watch the show.

195
00:13:46,985 --> 00:13:47,660
Rym: It'll be explained.

196
00:13:47,942 --> 00:13:48,399
Rym: Just watch it.

197
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:48,918
Rym: You'll figure it out.

198
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,600
Scott: Yeah, my mom is big on asking questions while watching movies.

199
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,177
Rym: What's going on?

200
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:53,559
Rym: Who's that guy in the mask?

201
00:13:53,844 --> 00:13:54,558
Rym: Is that the murderer?

202
00:13:54,841 --> 00:14:01,619
Scott: Even if you watch a movie with my mom that no one in the theater on opening night should be like, "Why is that?

203
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:02,949
Scott: What is that over

204
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:03,415
Scott: there?".

205
00:14:03,981 --> 00:14:05,859
Scott: And you're like, "Uh, just watch.

206
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,628
Scott: You'll find

207
00:14:06,851 --> 00:14:06,972
Scott: out.".

208
00:14:07,702 --> 00:14:09,319
Rym: But you get the group experience and all that.

209
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,798
Rym: But even if you've seen the anime before, because I had already seen Ava twice before we marathoned it.

210
00:14:15,181 --> 00:14:17,019
Scott: I had seen it once before we marathoned it.

211
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:22,937
Rym: So while I had seen it a bunch of times, I already knew a lot about it, and I put a lot of thought into the show.

212
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:34,639
Rym: Watching how other people reacted to scenes that I knew were coming up and watching someone else realize certain things that the show went on was almost as enjoyable as watching the show by myself the first time.

213
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,439
Scott: I don't know why that's enjoyable, but it definitely is.

214
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:45,440
Scott: Part of it is- When I was watching you play Half-Life 2, and you got to some parts, and I knew the whole game because I've played it through one and a half times.

215
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,918
Scott: And just watching you go through the same experience was like, "Ooh, he's gonna get to this part, OMG.

216
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:51,774
Rym: What's he gonna

217
00:14:51,794 --> 00:14:51,877
Rym: do?".

218
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,340
Rym: Part of it is you relive the experience.

219
00:14:53,980 --> 00:15:03,420
Rym: Remember the scene in Ava where the one robot eats the thing and then the crazy plot happens and you learn something scary and that everything happens, not to spoil anything.

220
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:09,115
Rym: That scene put chills through me when I first saw it, and I was just in awe of, "Wow, what kind of show is

221
00:15:09,136 --> 00:15:09,299
Rym: this?".

222
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,400
Rym: That wasn't what I expected.

223
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,720
Rym: This is, wow.

224
00:15:11,923 --> 00:15:12,919
Scott: I expected that, though.

225
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,440
Rym: But still, the way they did it, a chill went down my spine.

226
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:22,980
Rym: And I remember watching a friend of ours who hadn't seen the show before, and they reacted the same way when that scene happened.

227
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,600
Rym: And on one hand, I relived my experience.

228
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,232
Rym: On the other hand, I felt validated in that, "All right, that was a moment that really stuck out to

229
00:15:31,273 --> 00:15:31,375
Rym: me.".

230
00:15:31,841 --> 00:15:34,980
Rym: And wow, this person had the same reaction to that scene.

231
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:40,020
Scott: Maybe that is something because if I just play, let's say I just watch Ava again, right?

232
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,139
Scott: It's not gonna be the same experience for me if I just watch it again.

233
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:50,200
Scott: But if I watch someone else watch it again, then it's sort of like the first time, even though it's not exactly the first time.

234
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:54,740
Scott: It's sort of like, I guess, re-versionizing yourself in a way.

235
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,218
Scott: But it is.

236
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,840
Scott: Not completely, just in a small way.

237
00:15:56,982 --> 00:15:57,337
Rym: It works.

238
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:57,938
Rym: It works.

239
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:04,580
Rym: It's like, I think part of it, too, is especially if you're watching, say, when Scott Johnson showed us all Cowboy Bebop way back.

240
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:13,619
Rym: That was one of the defining moments in our lives because Scott Johnson, a good friend of ours now, was kind of one of the people who ran the anime club, and he was kind of Well, he didn't.

241
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,640
Scott: See, that was kind of weird.

242
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,140
Scott: I remember.

243
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,540
Scott: Oh, he didn't really, but we thought he did.

244
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,400
Scott: I remember in freshman year, we always saw this guy who was always up there at the front of the anime club.

245
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,092
Scott: And I was like, "Who's that

246
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:22,378
Scott: guy?".

247
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,400
Scott: And he was that guy that was up at the front of the anime club that didn't say anything, and I didn't know who he was, but I kept seeing him.

248
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:35,580
Rym: Now, we knew he was cool, and we assumed that he was the one who really ran the club because he seemed like he was always there and always kind of in charge from the shadows.

249
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,100
Scott: But really, he wasn't on that board or anything.

250
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:39,700
Rym: He was just friends with everyone on the board.

251
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,780
Scott: He was just Scott Johnson.

252
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,417
Scott: That's all he was.

253
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:47,260
Rym: Of course, he then went on, due to the political intrigue, to become president, and then I became president, but that's beside the point.

254
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,620
Scott: But besides the point, freshman year, there was a show, Cowboy Bebop.

255
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,539
Scott: I didn't even know the show, Cowboy Bebop, existed until I went to RIT.

256
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,520
Rym: I had seen Episode 5, the fight between Spike and Vicious.

257
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,320
Scott: I saw Episode 5 at the first anime club meeting ever.

258
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,180
Scott: As did I. And I knew that it was awesome.

259
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,739
Scott: But I never actually got around to watching it.

260
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,758
Scott: And then Scott Johnson said, "All right, I'm having an official anime club, Cowboy Bebop marathon.

261
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:13,278
Scott: Come to this building this weekend on these two days, and we'll watch the whole

262
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:13,539
Scott: thing.".

263
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:14,940
Scott: And that's what we did.

264
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:22,680
Rym: Honestly, pretty much, that was one of the earliest front row crew moments, because the front row crew, like the original core of it, all went to this marathon.

265
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,758
Rym: And then we became friends with Scott Johnson, because he was the man who gave us Cowboy Bebop.

266
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:27,858
Scott: That he was.

267
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:32,320
Rym: And I gotta say, Cowboy Bebop is probably the absolute perfect show to marathon.

268
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:43,400
Scott: Well, I think the problem with Cowboy Bebop is that if you have all of it at your disposal in a DVD box set, and you have time to kill, and you begin watching, it's very difficult to stop watching.

269
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,959
Rym: We experimentally verified this.

270
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:45,877
Rym: Was it Pete?

271
00:17:46,343 --> 00:17:46,718
Scott: It was Alex.

272
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,299
Rym: It was Alex.

273
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,020
Rym: Someone hadn't seen Cowboy Bebop all the way through.

274
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:50,515
Rym: Yep.

275
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,680
Rym: Like, they'd seen a little bit of it.

276
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,420
Rym: And it was me and Scott and that person.

277
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,280
Scott: It was you, me, and Alex in Colony.

278
00:17:55,463 --> 00:17:55,860
Scott: I remember.

279
00:17:56,101 --> 00:17:57,559
Rym: I don't know why I remember it being Pete.

280
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:58,640
Scott: I don't know either.

281
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,619
Rym: Well, I'm sure Alex and Pete can inform us which one of them it was.

282
00:18:02,342 --> 00:18:06,840
Scott: I'm 90% sure it was me, you, and Alex in Colony late at night after getting back from something.

283
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:11,320
Rym: No, we were back from vacation waiting for everyone else to get back into town.

284
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,379
Scott: I think that was it, yes.

285
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:19,196
Rym: Anyway, so we're going to lend it to the person, like, "Here, we'll watch the first couple episodes of Cowboy Bebop while we do this stuff, and then you can borrow the

286
00:18:19,236 --> 00:18:19,457
Rym: rest.".

287
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:22,018
Rym: And then we just kept watching it.

288
00:18:22,282 --> 00:18:22,920
Scott: Until it was over.

289
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,660
Rym: And we just kept watching it, and then it ended.

290
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,740
Rym: We were all sitting there staring at the screen after the last episode.

291
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,320
Rym: And then I think it was Scott who said, "So much for our weekend.

292
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:33,774
Rym: We just watched Cowboy

293
00:18:33,815 --> 00:18:34,119
Rym: Bebop.".

294
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,132
Scott: I think we actually sort of, I think we might've watched it from like 1 p.m.

295
00:18:38,152 --> 00:18:39,115
Scott: to 2 a.m.

296
00:18:39,135 --> 00:18:41,437
Scott: or something like that.

297
00:18:41,702 --> 00:18:43,520
Scott: And thus, it really didn't kill the whole weekend.

298
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,900
Rym: It was entirely unexpected, though.

299
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,357
Scott: It was like 12 hours, so...

300
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,439
Rym: We accidentally marathoned Cowboy Bebop.

301
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:55,100
Scott: I know, it's like 12 hours, you know, you think that's a long time, but really, if you start watching at like noon, you'll be done at midnight.

302
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,780
Scott: That's not really that long if you stop to eat.

303
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,112
Rym: Yep.

304
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:13,000
Rym: Plus, I mean, the shows like Cowboy Bebop and actually really, Escaflowne, because those two shows have this thing where the show is really good and draws you along, and Escaflowne has the additional bonus of every third or fourth episode ends on a cliffhanger.

305
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:26,260
Scott: That's the other thing about marathons, is that cliffhangers completely lose most of their effect, because while, you know, the cliffhanger event happens, and the event itself still has the impact, you don't have the pain of having to wait to see what happens next.

306
00:19:26,502 --> 00:19:28,279
Scott: You just have to switch DVDs and you're off.

307
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:38,806
Rym: I remember when I was in high school, and every month we bought, the day it came out, our friend Ken bought the next VHS tape of Escaflowne, and we then immediately watched it.

308
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,579
Rym: Like, literally, he'd show up and we'd watch the whole thing.

309
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:52,260
Rym: And I'm not gonna spoil anything, but the seventh, seven out of eight VHS tape of Escaflowne ends in one of the worst cliffhangers in all of anime.

310
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,461
Scott: Yep, definitely, I agree 100%.

311
00:19:54,461 --> 00:20:02,040
Rym: And I remember sitting there, and then Dan Greer, a good friend of mine, turns and says, "You know, we have to wait a full month before we find out what the fuck was up with that,

312
00:20:02,121 --> 00:20:02,347
Rym: right?".

313
00:20:03,146 --> 00:20:04,020
Scott: It sucks ass.

314
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:10,380
Rym: Yes, that month took longer than much of the rest of my life to live through.

315
00:20:12,162 --> 00:20:14,960
Rym: Of course, the anecdote I was getting to with that.

316
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:25,820
Rym: So we're marathoning, no, we'll do the whole story, we're marathoning Escaflowne at RIT in like, Sol 9, on the fancy TV in the nice lounge in the renovated building.

317
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:40,734
Rym: And of course, actually, we met one of our friends, Lara, who didn't really know her at all, this is a girl we'd seen, and she was walking by with her friends, and she saw that a bunch of geeks are watching an anime, and she kind of likes anime, so she brings all her friends in, like, "Can I

318
00:20:40,755 --> 00:20:41,019
Rym: watch?".

319
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,288
Rym: And all of us think,

320
00:20:42,772 --> 00:20:43,195
Rym: "Agoil.".

321
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:46,680
Scott: What, we all became Popeye all of a sudden?

322
00:20:47,841 --> 00:20:52,453
Rym: So of course, we say, "Yeah, sit down, we're watching Escaflowne, you just missed the first three episodes, here's what you missed, let's

323
00:20:52,473 --> 00:20:52,614
Rym: go.".

324
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:58,220
Rym: And after about two episodes, her friends are like, "Wait a minute, are you gonna watch this whole thing?

325
00:20:58,302 --> 00:20:58,797
Rym: How long is

326
00:20:58,838 --> 00:20:58,879
Rym: it?".

327
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,398
Rym: And we're like, "Uh, 12 hours, give or

328
00:21:01,438 --> 00:21:01,640
Rym: take?".

329
00:21:01,943 --> 00:21:03,217
Rym: And they're like, "Aw man, this sucks, let's

330
00:21:03,257 --> 00:21:03,419
Rym: go.".

331
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:10,019
Rym: And Lara said, "I'm staying," and she became a member of the front row crew pretty much right then and there.

332
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:10,453
Scott: Yep.

333
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:19,880
Scott: If you do a marathon in a semi-public space, and people see what you're doing, it sort of acts like a geek magnet sometimes, it's pretty useful.

334
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:31,400
Rym: So we didn't have all the box set with us, it was kind of scattered around, so it was all in other people's dorm rooms, and we'd go and get them one at a time, between DVDs, to give people a chance to go to pee and get snacks.

335
00:21:31,441 --> 00:21:32,636
Scott: I think you were watching VHSes.

336
00:21:33,284 --> 00:21:34,440
Rym: We might have been, I don't remember.

337
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,060
Scott: I think we were.

338
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,400
Rym: Yeah, we were, because we got it from the anime club.

339
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:45,220
Rym: Anyway, so we have Up Through Seven, we don't have Tape Eight with us physically, it's on another floor of the building.

340
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,950
Rym: Tape Seven ends, and everyone goes,

341
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:48,050
Rym: "Whoa."

342
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:50,660
Rym: Yep.

343
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:56,760
Rym: And then we sit there for a second, and I choose not to say anything, and Ken chooses not to say anything, because we've seen the show before, we know what happens.

344
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:02,858
Rym: So we just sit there, until eventually everyone goes, "Go get the tape, go get it,

345
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:03,219
Rym: now!".

346
00:22:03,941 --> 00:22:11,980
Rym: So we go, we get in the elevator, and we go down, and we get it, and we go, we're on our way back up, and the elevator just stops.

347
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,940
Scott: The elevator got stuck at that time.

348
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,880
Rym: The elevator got stuck.

349
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,280
Scott: Not lying, the elevator actually got stuck with the eighth tape inside of it.

350
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:33,838
Rym: So me and Ken, and these two other people who we didn't know, are standing there with the tape, and I turned, and I think he's the one who said, "You know, it's probably ironic that the two people who've seen the show are in this elevator with the

351
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:34,079
Rym: tape.".

352
00:22:34,904 --> 00:22:35,115
Rym: Yeah.

353
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:45,057
Rym: And then we're musing, "I wonder what they're doing, I wonder if they're looking for us, I wonder how long they can wait, I wonder if they're just gonna go out, break into the media play, and steal the last VHS

354
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:45,300
Rym: tape.".

355
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:53,320
Scott: Well I guess that is a way to simulate the experience of having to wait for the cliffhanger, and it was slightly painful, but it wasn't so bad.

356
00:22:53,521 --> 00:22:55,640
Scott: I imagine your month wait was much worse.

357
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,880
Rym: For me it was just hilarious.

358
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,780
Scott: It was like- But then again, I have an easier time waiting for cliffhangers than most people.

359
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:03,138
Scott: It doesn't bother me so much.

360
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:09,358
Rym: See, they don't bother me so much, but that particular cliffhanger, just because of- That is one of the roughest there is.

361
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,819
Rym: Because I can't spoil it, I can't even talk about it.

362
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:13,529
Rym: Yes.

363
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:19,013
Scott: But yeah, if nothing else- It's more like a space station hanger, you're hanging that far.

364
00:23:20,764 --> 00:23:28,437
Rym: I think the moral is simply, if you marathon anime, anime marathons, especially in colleges, are basically anecdote magnets.

365
00:23:29,602 --> 00:23:32,440
Rym: Something is going to happen, you're gonna have a story to tell afterwards.

366
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:41,440
Scott: Spending 12 hours in a room with a group of people, as a sequential work of art plays nonstop is like a recipe for awesome.

367
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,360
Rym: Plus, I mean, my favorite moment in any marathon ever was still at the end of Cowboy Bebop.

368
00:23:46,682 --> 00:23:48,534
Rym: Because it was a shared experience of like 20, 25 people.

369
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,840
Rym: And all of us watched this amazing work of art from start to finish, and it ended.

370
00:23:56,741 --> 00:23:59,800
Rym: And we all sat there as the closing credits played and finished.

371
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:02,960
Rym: And then it was just a black screen with the projector just sitting there in idle.

372
00:24:03,602 --> 00:24:05,479
Rym: And for a good five minutes, no one said a word.

373
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,444
Rym: Everyone just sat there like-.

374
00:24:07,845 --> 00:24:12,676
Rym: The silence was palpable and painful, and no one had the balls to break it.

375
00:24:13,144 --> 00:24:13,337
Rym: Nope.

376
00:24:13,882 --> 00:24:25,640
Scott: I noticed that at the end of a lot of shows, and even just watching a 90 minute movie, if it's a serious kind of movie, people just do not have the balls to be the first person to say something.

377
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:29,540
Rym: But a marathon is so much more, it's kind of like when we talked about Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

378
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,298
Rym: The game itself was kind of meh.

379
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:39,060
Rym: But because we played the game in marathon format, we took an otherwise mediocre game and turned it into this shared experience.

380
00:24:39,801 --> 00:24:42,900
Rym: Because it went on so long, I mean it took longer than watching any anime.

381
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,840
Rym: That was a long time to game.

382
00:24:45,021 --> 00:24:45,397
Scott: It did, it did.

383
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,700
Scott: It took like all weekend.

384
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,860
Scott: It took like twenty, like eighteen- Like Friday night, it took like all Friday, all Saturday, and all Sunday.

385
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:52,588
Rym: Yep.

386
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,020
Rym: Pretty much nonstop with a short break to sleep after Katsu fell asleep and ran away with the bus.

387
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,160
Scott: We slept a little bit Friday and a little bit Saturday.

388
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,840
Rym: And we stopped to go to a hockey game, but at the hockey game we couldn't stop talking about Crystal Chronicles.

389
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,999
Scott: Well we were strategizing about what we were going to do next.

390
00:25:07,302 --> 00:25:08,975
Scott: Like yeah, we're going to go back there and then...

391
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:19,909
Rym: But the thing is, it's weird how if you take humans and put them in a shared experience that takes that much time, there's this level of bonding that you can't really get any other way.

392
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,400
Rym: And like the experience, like I don't remember, I remember Cowboy Bebop as an experience.

393
00:25:25,842 --> 00:25:29,459
Rym: But I remember it colored by the shared experience of the people I watched it with.

394
00:25:30,283 --> 00:25:32,380
Rym: And I feel like it was a greater experience as a result.

395
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:39,060
Scott: Yeah, I just, I remember the room and I remember the people in there and I remember everyone was laying on all, because it was the chemistry lecture hall.

396
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,979
Rym: I remember when the crazy guy pulled out his Airsoft MP5 and threatened to kill you.

397
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,640
Scott: Yep, yep, that was pretty...

398
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,920
Rym: That was a funny story for another time.

399
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,980
Scott: And then we switched up to the dubs as soon as we got to the Mushroom episode.

400
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:49,713
Rym: Oh man.

401
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:54,216
Scott: Because the Mushroom episode actually is one of the few anime where the dub is better than the sub.

402
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,403
Scott: So when we got to the Mushroom episode, we switched to the dub and then we liked it so much.

403
00:25:58,423 --> 00:25:59,819
Scott: we stayed with the dub through to the end.

404
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:06,551
Rym: One guy who was super fanboy said, "Damn it you guys, if you don't change it back to the real sub, I'm

405
00:26:06,591 --> 00:26:06,894
Rym: leaving.".

406
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,979
Rym: And I note that he didn't leave.

407
00:26:10,171 --> 00:26:10,256
Scott: Yep.

408
00:26:11,563 --> 00:26:12,216
Scott: Yep, yep, yep.

409
00:26:12,761 --> 00:26:14,620
Rym: But seriously, that shared experience.

410
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:21,039
Rym: And then I remember after it ended and eventually someone turned the lights on and everyone kind of shuffled out of the room in a daze.

411
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:25,819
Rym: And almost the entire group was walking together back across the quarter mile to the dorms.

412
00:26:26,363 --> 00:26:28,040
Rym: And eventually the conversation started.

413
00:26:28,641 --> 00:26:32,239
Rym: And we talked about Cowboy Bebop for quite some time.

414
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:33,539
Scott: Hard nod to.

415
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:49,120
Scott: I mean, if you do something with some people for like, you know, a day or two and you don't do anything else in those two days and you're doing it with the same people the whole time, you kind of don't have much to do after that other than talk about what you just did.

416
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,680
Rym: Plus, now that I think about it more, your focus in the world kind of narrow.

417
00:26:53,800 --> 00:27:00,998
Rym: I mean, now when you're watching a movie and when you first sit down in the theater, like you still see the seats in front of you and the walls of the theater and the lights and your hands.

418
00:27:01,388 --> 00:27:01,560
Rym: Yep.

419
00:27:01,782 --> 00:27:04,320
Rym: And if the movie's bad, you still see those things.

420
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,195
Rym: But if the movie draws you in, you forget that you're in a theater and you just see what's going on.

421
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:09,760
Scott: Yep.

422
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:25,220
Rym: But when you watch a marathon, when you marathon something that long in one contiguous stretch with a bunch of people, it's almost like your worldview narrows to where you only exist in that room watching that show and you start to forget about all your other concerns.

423
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,959
Scott: Yeah, you absolutely begin to.

424
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,820
Scott: You pretty much guaranteed you forget about your homeworks, your job, your family, everything.

425
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,500
Scott: Anything outside of that room is completely lost.

426
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:40,160
Scott: And even the stuff that's in the room and outside of the show get completely lost.

427
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,320
Scott: I mean, very surreal and awesome.

428
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,040
Rym: When we were on Ava the first time, we forgot to eat for a while.

429
00:27:46,423 --> 00:27:48,239
Rym: And then we were like, oh, crap, we got to eat.

430
00:27:48,782 --> 00:27:51,319
Rym: And it took it took a while for us to realize that fact.

431
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,043
Scott: Yep.

432
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:53,518
Scott: Good times.

433
00:27:53,902 --> 00:27:56,620
Rym: And I remember very specifically the Escaflowne marathon.

434
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:02,597
Rym: It finished and it was like Sunday evening and we all go to get dinner and I go back to my dorm room.

435
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,180
Rym: You know, still like really thinking about that show because I fucking love that show.

436
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:09,798
Rym: And then I sit down in my computer desk and I'm like, ah.

437
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:21,940
Rym: And then I remembered suddenly that I had this life where I was a student going to college and I had homework and I had classes the next day and it kind of weren't being transported to another world.

438
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:25,840
Scott: It was like a fantasy and dragons and guys with wings and robots.

439
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,780
Rym: It sounds silly, but I suddenly remembered that and cat girls.

440
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,699
Rym: I have a real life and now I have to go back to it.

441
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,599
Rym: And I was kind of surprised by that.

442
00:28:35,082 --> 00:28:38,179
Rym: And I totally skipped class Monday because I didn't have any of my homework done.

443
00:28:38,741 --> 00:28:40,399
Scott: Well, it's totally, you know, escapism.

444
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:47,252
Scott: You escape from the real world into this the world of whatever show you're watching for, you know, 12 hours, 24 hours, however long.

445
00:28:48,661 --> 00:28:51,860
Scott: And sometimes you just really need that in your life.

446
00:28:52,541 --> 00:28:59,476
Rym: You get so into it that you can care so much about the people on the screen, so much more so than you would if you watched it spread out over 26 weeks.

447
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:00,780
Scott: Yep.

448
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:06,464
Rym: In general, though, I'd say you really can't marathon anything that's longer than about 39, 40 episodes.

449
00:29:07,701 --> 00:29:09,160
Scott: No, it just takes too damn long.

450
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,560
Rym: Even Utena, we didn't marathon.

451
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,819
Rym: We watched it in spurts.

452
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,400
Rym: Like we marathon.

453
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:12,621
Rym: I

454
00:29:12,661 --> 00:29:30,558
Scott: guess the way you could do that is if you were some punk kids in high school or younger and you had summer vacation and you didn't have like summer camp or anything and you just sat around your house every day doing nothing, you could get all your high school friends together and you can marathon something big like, you know, a Gundam, which is 50 something episodes long or something like that.

455
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:34,979
Scott: But other than that, more than 50 episodes, you really can't do it.

456
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,199
Scott: It just doesn't happen.

457
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:46,119
Rym: I mean, off the hand, any shows that you should marathon if you haven't seen them already, just, you know, if you want to get in on this whole experience, because if you pick a bad show to marathon, you're not going to enjoy it.

458
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,259
Scott: No, very bad.

459
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,839
Rym: Like Crest of the Stars, I love it, but it's a little slow.

460
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:54,860
Rym: Or Gasaraki, you don't want to marathon the first half of that.

461
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:04,478
Scott: I think a good show to start marathoning, like to begin your marathon practice is Big O because Big O season one is 13 episodes and then Big O season two is 13 episodes.

462
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,960
Scott: You can sort of break it into two days.

463
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,620
Rym: Except, except for the fact that Big O one ends on one of the bigger cliffhangers in anime.

464
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,442
Scott: I know, but you can also watch it as a single 26.

465
00:30:15,442 --> 00:30:21,479
Scott: So it's, and it is sequential, there's not a lot of recap, everything moves quickly, the dub is awesome.

466
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:29,178
Rym: I would say that watching Big O in marathon form is better than watching it individually, straight up.

467
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,659
Rym: And you won't realize why until you start watching Big O too.

468
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,275
Scott: Yep.

469
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:46,240
Rym: Basically, you watch, we did a final thoughts episode on Big O too, so go listen to that if you want to find out more, but basically Big O, the first 13 episodes are this interesting but a little bit episodic, silly, not too serious, but kind of serious.

470
00:30:46,561 --> 00:30:47,117
Rym: It's a romp.

471
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:47,959
Rym: It's fun.

472
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,080
Rym: It's a robot punching other robots in the face.

473
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,639
Rym: And let me tell you, that's probably the best punch in anime ever.

474
00:30:54,283 --> 00:30:54,659
Rym: Possibly.

475
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,952
Rym: When the elbow thing goes, yup.

476
00:30:57,541 --> 00:30:58,839
Rym: And then you watch Big O too.

477
00:30:59,502 --> 00:31:01,980
Rym: And the whole show is completely different at that point.

478
00:31:02,381 --> 00:31:06,260
Rym: And you go, if you think about Big O one, you realize a lot of interesting things.

479
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,799
Scott: It switches from mad Batman to sad Batman.

480
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:12,437
Rym: I don't think we ever explained that.

481
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:14,858
Scott: We're not going to.

482
00:31:15,121 --> 00:31:15,635
Rym: No, of course not.

483
00:31:16,481 --> 00:31:17,300
Rym: Sad Batman.

484
00:31:18,381 --> 00:31:19,139
Scott: Mad Batman.

485
00:31:19,701 --> 00:31:20,440
Rym: Bad Batman.

486
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,038
Scott: Glad Batman.

487
00:31:22,864 --> 00:31:23,560
Rym: That didn't happen.

488
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:24,360
Scott: No it didn't.

489
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,637
Rym: There was no Glad Batman in that entire, no there was.

490
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,740
Rym: Free bat incident, Bruce Wayne, when he was a kid was Glad Batman.

491
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,092
Rym: Yep.

492
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,400
Rym: That's the only Glad Batman.

493
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:32,915
Rym: Yep.

494
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:33,676
Rym: All right.

495
00:31:33,982 --> 00:31:35,520
Rym: I think this episode is dying.

496
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,000
Rym: Al Hazzard, the original OAV, is a great marathon.

497
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,020
Rym: Oh, that's awesome.

498
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,240
Rym: It's compact, it's funny, but it's also a beautiful love story.

499
00:31:43,961 --> 00:31:49,760
Rym: And the story, this doesn't ruin anything, but it's a very perfectly executed story that comes full circle.

500
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,639
Rym: And if you watch it all in one go, it'll have a lot more impact.

501
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:53,325
Rym: Yeah.

502
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,779
Rym: Especially because then you can watch the first episode again.

503
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,320
Rym: Like literally, watch Al Hazzard, then watch the first episode again, and then stop there.

504
00:32:03,202 --> 00:32:03,244
Rym: Ah.

505
00:32:04,106 --> 00:32:04,398
Rym: Yes.

506
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:08,760
Rym: Of course, Escaflowne, Ava, Cowboy Bebop.

507
00:32:09,401 --> 00:32:12,918
Scott: Any show that's awesome, you know, separate, will be also awesome.

508
00:32:12,938 --> 00:32:13,300
Scott: marathon.

509
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,820
Rym: Hellsing ain't so bad, actually.

510
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,180
Scott: Yeah, Hellsing's a good choice.

511
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,480
Rym: 'Cause if you don't keep watching it, you'll lose interest.

512
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:19,398
Scott: Yep.

513
00:32:20,141 --> 00:32:21,934
Scott: I'm trying to think of more, but, uh, oh.

514
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:24,459
Rym: I'd say Utena, but no.

515
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,169
Rym: The real answer is marathon.

516
00:32:26,209 --> 00:32:27,780
Rym: the last 13 episodes of Utena.

517
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,165
Scott: The first season of Initial D.

518
00:32:29,687 --> 00:32:35,059
Rym: Yeah, the first season of Initial D. Because basically, once you get drawn into that show, you're either gonna love it or hate it.

519
00:32:35,881 --> 00:32:39,240
Scott: A lot of the shorter Gundams, like some of the Gundam OAVs, those are good.

520
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,660
Rym: Oh yeah, don't watch War in the Pocket episode at this time.

521
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,620
Rym: Just watch it like a movie.

522
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,050
Scott: Yep.

523
00:32:43,845 --> 00:32:44,040
Scott: Alright.

524
00:32:44,482 --> 00:32:44,999
Scott: I think we're done.

525
00:32:45,341 --> 00:32:45,919
Rym: I think we're done.

526
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,600
Rym: Uh, stay tuned tomorrow.

527
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:56,140
Rym: We'll get back to our regularly scheduled GeekNights, and, uh, look forward to seeing us at ConnectiCon, Otakon, the New York Anime Festival, and Katsucon.

528
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,199
Scott: We're not going to Anime Next this weekend.

529
00:32:58,401 --> 00:32:59,419
Scott: We thought we were, but we're not.

530
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,280
Rym: Yes, we'll talk about that next Wednesday.

531
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:01,627
Rym: Yep.

532
00:33:02,321 --> 00:33:03,140
Scott: After Anime Next.

533
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,279
Rym: Yes, of course!
