1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,671
Rym: It's Wednesday March 8th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:16,000
Rym: We talk about how to not suck at not being a fanboy.

3
00:00:16,961 --> 00:00:17,997
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:18,923 --> 00:00:22,756
Rym: So today I had an interview with a possibly new job down in Manhattan.

5
00:00:22,837 --> 00:00:23,619
Rym: We'll see how that goes.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,826
Scott: Hooray a job of money.

7
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:30,660
Rym: Yeah, so I may or may not continue to be working at IBM in the coming few weeks.

8
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:34,408
Scott: So no more fun stories about stupid people.

9
00:00:34,428 --> 00:00:40,499
Rym: Oh, I'll say this much once I leave IBM and I know I'm never gonna come back.

10
00:00:41,563 --> 00:00:42,188
Rym: I'm not like.

11
00:00:42,228 --> 00:00:43,700
Rym: I can't reveal any of these secrets.

12
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:53,340
Rym: I know like I can't talk about a lot of the like specific secret confidential whatever But I can definitely do a tell all my experiences at IBM.

13
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:57,512
Rym: So expect at least one or two podcasts on that.

14
00:00:57,552 --> 00:00:58,054
Rym: if this comes to.

15
00:00:58,074 --> 00:00:59,580
Scott: so that'll be like a Dilbert Thursday.

16
00:00:59,964 --> 00:01:00,875
Rym: He has something like that.

17
00:01:01,664 --> 00:01:11,610
Scott: Yeah, so today You might have noticed I changed some things on The WordPress our blog that runs the podcast and everything.

18
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:19,127
Rym: now if a million episodes of GeekNights suddenly appeared in your pod feeder We're sorry, but I think you did something wrong.

19
00:01:19,568 --> 00:01:21,774
Scott: Well, you didn't necessarily do something wrong.

20
00:01:21,814 --> 00:01:26,070
Scott: You just did something poor as In this is all Scott.

21
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,300
Rym: I don't even use pod catchers.

22
00:01:27,551 --> 00:01:37,887
Scott: Yeah If you're using a crummy pod catcher like I don't know some random RSS reader or if you're subscribed to the wrong feed the feed You should be subscribed to is the feed burner.

23
00:01:37,987 --> 00:01:41,520
Scott: one feeds that feed burner comm slash whatever nights GeekNights.

24
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:48,193
Rym: Yeah, if anyone out there is subscribed to just a raw WordPress feed stop doing that because it's not good for you.

25
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:49,860
Rym: that feed can change a lot.

26
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:51,708
Rym: The feed burner feed is the official one.

27
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:54,100
Rym: That's the only one that we I guess support.

28
00:01:54,701 --> 00:02:01,700
Scott: Mm-hmm, and if you have your pod catcher set up to download every episode no matter what you probably don't want to do that.

29
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,870
Scott: you probably want to set it to download the most recent episode or Download episodes when you click on them.

30
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,199
Scott: that way you don't automatically download a billion episodes.

31
00:02:09,282 --> 00:02:10,059
Scott: You know you already listened.

32
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:19,400
Scott: The other thing is we do have separate feeds now if you oh you can only let you if you want You can subscribe to just Monday just Tuesday or just Wednesday of GeekNights.

33
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:23,920
Rym: We've already had about 20 people do this so far even though we haven't really advertised that these are there.

34
00:02:24,343 --> 00:02:26,220
Rym: I imagine these people found them via iTunes.

35
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:33,060
Scott: Yeah, if you go to iTunes or Yahoo podcast you can find the separate GeekNights feeds for Monday Tuesday Wednesday.

36
00:02:34,026 --> 00:02:40,580
Scott: And of course you'll still be able to find the GeekNights Total feed which has Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday all in one yep.

37
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:48,040
Rym: And once we finish with the theme and everything's all set up with the new look for GeekNights Those feeds are all going to be prominently available.

38
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:58,547
Scott: Yep, one more thing is that if you're a person who is only listening or you found us via the Monday only Tuesday only You know links.

39
00:02:58,768 --> 00:03:01,199
Scott: I guess it would be a Wednesday only link because it's Wednesday, right?

40
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,240
Scott: Yeah, yes, if you're subscribed to just GeekNights anime guess what we do three other days a week of podcasting.

41
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,595
Scott: So if you like things besides anime you should subscribe to the GeekNights normal feed.

42
00:03:13,655 --> 00:03:14,517
Scott: that has everything in it.

43
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:21,499
Rym: now eventually we're gonna add all that stuff to the Closing bit so we won't have to say this at the beginning of every.

44
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,812
Scott: yeah And also we will have a Thursday only feed.

45
00:03:23,853 --> 00:03:29,073
Rym: I know some people like Thursday But yeah, we had some people tell us lately that Thursdays are the favorite days.

46
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:30,940
Scott: really because it's not my favorite day.

47
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:33,450
Scott: Yeah, it's not the easiest day for me.

48
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:33,831
Rym: Well.

49
00:03:33,871 --> 00:03:38,626
Rym: It'll be easier once we finish all the research We've got lined up for the big Thursday episodes.

50
00:03:39,087 --> 00:03:44,119
Scott: yep, but yeah, so everyone knows that's how your subscription should go.

51
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,083
Scott: Everything is feed burner.

52
00:03:46,124 --> 00:03:47,327
Scott: don't subscribe to anything.

53
00:03:47,347 --> 00:03:48,170
Scott: That's not feed burner.

54
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:51,400
Scott: Yeah, so someone interviewed Michael Dell today.

55
00:03:52,323 --> 00:03:59,068
Scott: I don't know if you know, but Michael Dell is the guy who's in charge of Dell computers, and they said hey How come you're not being all Linux II?

56
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,000
Rym: and he gave some pretty good answers as to why not yeah?

57
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,980
Scott: So basically what he said was he tried ready.

58
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,797
Scott: They tried back in the day to just use Red Hat and the problem was is no one bought it?

59
00:04:08,838 --> 00:04:12,080
Scott: because they said We don't want to use Red Hat Red Hat sucks.

60
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,590
Scott: Why don't you have this other distribution or this other distribution?

61
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,254
Scott: so he says you know what.

62
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:19,180
Scott: fine if we put only one?

63
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:19,880
Scott: Distribution.

64
00:04:20,062 --> 00:04:22,969
Scott: everyone would complain that they didn't pick the distribution that they wanted.

65
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:30,389
Scott: if they picked a few distributions like let's say three or four People would complain because why not have this one?

66
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,613
Scott: and this one also?

67
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:33,880
Rym: yeah, but I use kibonto bla bla bla.

68
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:35,644
Rym: Oh, well, I use Mandrake.

69
00:04:35,905 --> 00:04:45,880
Scott: Yeah, Mandriva now whatever yeah, so the point is that he makes is that it's not possible or Practical for Dell to support all those different distributions.

70
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:55,319
Scott: They could reasonably support a few, but the problem is is no distribution has such a vast majority of Following that they can pick that one.

71
00:04:55,782 --> 00:04:58,474
Scott: You know it's like Ubuntu might be the most popular.

72
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:06,490
Scott: the most popular means 10% which means if they pick Ubuntu 90% of people who want Linux on a Dell would still complain.

73
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:11,369
Rym: now my take on this is that they don't need to market this To people who already know about Linux.

74
00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:17,928
Rym: if you already have a favorite distro You're not likely one of Dell's Linux box customers.

75
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:18,109
Rym: see.

76
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,981
Scott: that's what you would think, but it seems like Freaking.

77
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:25,438
Scott: people actually want to buy Dell's with their Linux of choice pre-installed.

78
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,100
Scott: I don't know what they see.

79
00:05:26,303 --> 00:05:27,520
Rym: I think those people are minority.

80
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:37,520
Rym: I think what Dell could do is offer maybe just Ubuntu or maybe a handful of OS's depending and Offer these not not offer them to Linux geeks.

81
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:47,826
Rym: We'll do it on their own anyway But market them as a solution like an alternative to Windows like heavily market Linux as like all the smart people use Linux The cool people use Linux doesn't crash.

82
00:05:48,027 --> 00:05:50,295
Rym: you can use Linux - it's more secure.

83
00:05:50,315 --> 00:05:53,145
Rym: if you can't afford OS X Yeah, you know that's it.

84
00:05:53,165 --> 00:05:57,060
Scott: I think Dell's strategy isn't to sell computers of that Windows.

85
00:05:57,181 --> 00:06:08,890
Scott: I think their strategy sell computers period is to sell computers period and The only reason that they want to have Linux computers at all is because that way they could sell Computers to people who are Linux users.

86
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,000
Scott: right now Dell really can't sell to Linux users.

87
00:06:11,101 --> 00:06:12,980
Scott: Linux users will go out and build their own computer.

88
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:14,887
Scott: So that's why Dell started this.

89
00:06:14,987 --> 00:06:23,480
Scott: he says they started this n-series which comes with the free DOS Which means you can erase free DOS and put whatever Linux you want on there, and you don't have to pay the windows tax.

90
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:24,884
Rym: Yeah, now part of the reason.

91
00:06:24,924 --> 00:06:27,211
Rym: I mean you wonder why don't they just offer it without any OS?

92
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:35,260
Rym: but apparently Microsoft got really angry Way back when they decided to do that sort of thing claiming that they're just promoting piracy.

93
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,170
Rym: You know who would buy a computer without an operating system.

94
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,037
Rym: They're obviously going to pirate pirate windows.

95
00:06:40,097 --> 00:06:40,880
Rym: No one uses Linux.

96
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:48,000
Scott: Yeah, I think that if but Dell really pushed it though today and tried to sell computers that OS is that they would probably succeed.

97
00:06:48,502 --> 00:06:50,650
Rym: Yeah, but I don't see Dell doing that anytime soon.

98
00:06:50,972 --> 00:06:53,060
Scott: No they have no reason to just throw free dogs on there.

99
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,204
Scott: Okay, it doesn't matter.

100
00:06:54,686 --> 00:06:57,557
Scott: You know it keeps Microsoft and complaining what it doesn't mean.

101
00:06:57,577 --> 00:07:04,910
Rym: shit though I definitely think at least someone could make some sort of Linux computer combo and sell them to the market.

102
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:07,999
Rym: as long as they advertised and did this marketing campaign.

103
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:14,240
Rym: for You know just promoting Linux as a solution that is secure and maybe make people feel smart about using Linux.

104
00:07:15,004 --> 00:07:16,392
Scott: Yes, that's the one thing is it?

105
00:07:16,472 --> 00:07:17,720
Scott: no because Linux is free.

106
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,707
Scott: No one's gonna put money in to try to sell it.

107
00:07:19,848 --> 00:07:28,014
Scott: all they do is you know they throw it on some really cheap hardware And say hey, here's a whole computer for only like a hundred bucks.

108
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:31,104
Scott: 200 bucks come get it You know and it.

109
00:07:31,605 --> 00:07:36,000
Scott: it gives Linux this kind of like because they don't advertise all the good stuff about Linux.

110
00:07:36,682 --> 00:07:44,350
Scott: It gives it this kind of like Hyundai kind of feel like Kia kind of feel we're like oh, it's cheap But it's not as you know good.

111
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:45,093
Rym: Yeah, it's cheap.

112
00:07:45,134 --> 00:07:46,400
Rym: therefore it must suck.

113
00:07:46,681 --> 00:07:57,079
Rym: Yeah, and it's that's the opposite of true, and I think if someone like sold some computers The opposite of true exactly not not false not it's a lie, but that's the opposite of true.

114
00:07:57,179 --> 00:07:59,360
Scott: again I am more tired today than it was yesterday.

115
00:07:59,561 --> 00:07:59,802
Scott: So

116
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:13,697
Rym: see surprisingly despite the fact that I spent the morning in Manhattan And I took an ass early train into the city like I got to the train station so early There was no one else there, and I took the peak like commuter train in almost entirely by myself.

117
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:16,727
Scott: Yeah, well I Did work at work today, so I'm all tired.

118
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:21,144
Rym: Yeah, I also did work at work today, and I walked all around, New York City No great.

119
00:08:21,265 --> 00:08:23,920
Rym: Yeah, so what was I pass out soon?

120
00:08:24,301 --> 00:08:30,884
Scott: Yeah, if they put Ubuntu on a computer, and they sold it as this computer won't get viruses It won't crash.

121
00:08:31,266 --> 00:08:34,216
Scott: It does this and this and this and this don't you know don't?

122
00:08:34,256 --> 00:08:35,480
Scott: you're not to pay for software.

123
00:08:35,842 --> 00:08:40,366
Scott: There's software that does almost whatever you want already on it And you can still.

124
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:43,299
Scott: I am your friends, and you can still do all these great things you know.

125
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,315
Scott: But you know don't try to buy software in the store and don't try to play a game.

126
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:51,737
Scott: Yeah That's the problem is like no matter what you advertise.

127
00:08:51,757 --> 00:08:56,414
Scott: There's still Something that someone's gonna try to do that you can't do and that's the problem with Linux.

128
00:08:56,615 --> 00:08:59,208
Scott: someone will go and buy That digital camera.

129
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:00,736
Scott: that doesn't work that scanner.

130
00:09:00,756 --> 00:09:01,339
Scott: that doesn't work.

131
00:09:01,781 --> 00:09:05,519
Scott: They'll try to plug in their video camera to download a video off of it, and it won't work.

132
00:09:06,384 --> 00:09:07,027
Scott: You know that's.

133
00:09:07,188 --> 00:09:09,259
Scott: that's what you got to get over that kind of stuff.

134
00:09:09,862 --> 00:09:12,972
Rym: Yeah, the problem is it's not fun to make that sort of thing work.

135
00:09:13,414 --> 00:09:13,775
Scott: No it's.

136
00:09:13,815 --> 00:09:18,300
Rym: I mean I'll admit it I when I buy a new you know bit that's gonna go into my computer.

137
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:25,253
Rym: I'll look online and I'll find if someone else has gotten into work in Linux, and if no one else has I don't buy that bit.

138
00:09:25,658 --> 00:09:31,578
Scott: yep And that's the good way to go because now companies are being forced to make things work with Linux before they sell them.

139
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:32,947
Rym: yeah I mean Nvidia.

140
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:42,447
Scott: yeah The problem is is an already existing things and in super new things because a lot of companies will say well We don't need Linux support right away.

141
00:09:42,487 --> 00:09:43,351
Scott: It won't make a difference.

142
00:09:43,391 --> 00:09:49,680
Scott: You know and they'll put it out, and then you got to wait or Something is so old and Linux support isn't gonna come around.

143
00:09:50,142 --> 00:09:54,460
Scott: But it's something useful that everyone has like a webcam of some sort or something like that.

144
00:09:56,742 --> 00:10:08,744
Rym: Well anyway to move on to more relevant Anime related news since it is anime day Otakon for any of you who are planning to go to it has all but sold out of the hotel rooms that are remaining for This year.

145
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:09,067
Rym: well.

146
00:10:09,088 --> 00:10:10,159
Scott: There's a big surprise.

147
00:10:10,682 --> 00:10:13,980
Scott: Yeah, they have a heart attack and die from not surprised.

148
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:19,834
Rym: Well the thing is actually two of the hotels sold out within a week of the dates being announced.

149
00:10:19,955 --> 00:10:31,930
Rym: You know last August Mm-hmm, but yeah if any of you out there planning go to Otakon get your hotel room right now like literally stop listening to GeekNights and go get a hotel room.

150
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:38,800
Scott: otherwise you're probably gonna be screwed Doesn't matter at this point if you get a hotel room you're gonna be far far away from the convention center.

151
00:10:39,883 --> 00:10:46,257
Rym: Away, I think there are a few rooms left that are closed But those are the expensive rooms that most young fan children can't afford.

152
00:10:46,538 --> 00:10:49,226
Rym: yep We used to be that way in other news.

153
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:54,120
Scott: anime, Boston their artists alley sold out in five minutes and a few seconds.

154
00:10:55,541 --> 00:11:02,730
Scott: So next year, they're making their artists alley much bigger, but if you're looking for a good artists alley I would recommend going to anime Boston this year where we might go.

155
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:08,346
Scott: Yeah, we're thinking about it, and they'll be Packed artists alley of awesome.

156
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:14,270
Rym: and of course if you want to be in the Otakon artists alley subscribe to their RSS feed and Watch because last year.

157
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,639
Rym: I think it sold out within an hour.

158
00:11:16,621 --> 00:11:19,952
Scott: Yeah, but you can't beat anime Boston's five minutes now.

159
00:11:19,992 --> 00:11:20,434
Rym: We'll see.

160
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:20,775
Rym: we'll see.

161
00:11:20,795 --> 00:11:22,260
Rym: it'll be a race at the artists alleys.

162
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:24,329
Scott: Yeah, oh one more thing.

163
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:34,981
Scott: there's some con in Australia or something And I think they set a policy for their dealers room that allows selling bootlegs as long as they're not licensed for release in Australia.

164
00:11:35,182 --> 00:11:39,275
Scott: so it's like if it's not licensed you can sell it here even if it's bootleg.

165
00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:40,800
Scott: so we'll see what happens to that convention.

166
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:46,800
Rym: Yeah, I mean there's a whole bunch of tricky stuff about copyright law, and I don't know much about Australian copyright law.

167
00:11:47,202 --> 00:11:48,025
Rym: I know in many ways.

168
00:11:48,085 --> 00:11:51,479
Rym: It's a lot more draconian, but there might be a big loophole here.

169
00:11:52,142 --> 00:11:52,464
Scott: I don't know.

170
00:11:52,885 --> 00:11:53,990
Scott: see it's always weird to me.

171
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,681
Scott: the places that can get away with selling bootlegs in the places They can't.

172
00:11:56,701 --> 00:12:08,580
Scott: it's like you have an anime convention for three days right if any bootleg DVDs are sold there It's like oh my god, but you have a store down the street from us an anime store And they sell bootlegs are crazy, and then no one cares.

173
00:12:08,822 --> 00:12:10,799
Rym: I don't think they have anything that isn't a bootleg.

174
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:15,360
Scott: Yeah, because they can't really don't really compete with the Best Buy Pro DVD market.

175
00:12:15,421 --> 00:12:16,820
Rym: They can yeah, not even the DVDs.

176
00:12:16,941 --> 00:12:20,958
Rym: They have all these bootleg wall scrolls and bootleg posters and VHS bootleg.

177
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,494
Scott: well They have some non bootleg some of the toys and things.

178
00:12:23,675 --> 00:12:24,340
Rym: yeah some of the toys.

179
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,163
Rym: But I don't think they have a non bootleg wall scroll in that entire building Maybe not?

180
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:32,695
Rym: they also know as I say that I've got a bootleg or tenof poster.

181
00:12:32,735 --> 00:12:34,420
Rym: I bought from them hanging above my desk.

182
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:35,602
Scott: Awesome.

183
00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:45,613
Scott: Yeah, but also Another example like the super Midtown comic book store in New York You know they sell bootlegs at crazy stuff like all these old TV shows.

184
00:12:45,653 --> 00:12:47,802
Scott: you can buy like all of XO squad and DVD from Them.

185
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:52,488
Scott: they used to saw all of Thundercats on DVD But then Thundercats came out on DVD.

186
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:55,900
Scott: so they get the pros in and they sell the other one.

187
00:12:55,981 --> 00:12:56,769
Scott: You know they get the other.

188
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:57,719
Scott: they take the bootlegs away.

189
00:12:59,041 --> 00:12:59,745
Scott: It's kind of weird.

190
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:02,037
Scott: Yeah, I don't know how to get away with that.

191
00:13:02,097 --> 00:13:02,660
Scott: It's like this.

192
00:13:02,841 --> 00:13:03,743
Rym: You know why there's.

193
00:13:03,763 --> 00:13:09,420
Rym: so there's so many people out there selling bootlegs that you can't get them all and it's really not.

194
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,232
Scott: It's like our friend Pete, but I mean all you did was walk into the store.

195
00:13:12,273 --> 00:13:16,138
Scott: There's a giant giant rack That's so obvious full of bootleg TV.

196
00:13:16,902 --> 00:13:20,614
Rym: I find out we had a similar discussion with Pete who you know tests food.

197
00:13:21,076 --> 00:13:31,644
Rym: as we were walking down in Chinatown over the weekend and we saw the shady dude selling raw deer heads out of a cardboard box on the side of the street and That sort of stuff.

198
00:13:31,664 --> 00:13:32,771
Rym: you just you can't stop it.

199
00:13:33,214 --> 00:13:37,020
Scott: if you can't stop it Then it's effectively not illegal and everyone should just do it anyway.

200
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:38,943
Rym: Well, here's the thing.

201
00:13:39,044 --> 00:13:43,420
Rym: it's real easy to catch people at a con because it's easy to just walk around and look what everyone's got.

202
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:44,828
Scott: Well, you keep it hidden.

203
00:13:44,868 --> 00:13:46,840
Scott: You know, you know, we'll close by.

204
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:51,760
Scott: You know a lot of the dealers had those boxes under their tables and you just assume those boxes.

205
00:13:52,322 --> 00:13:55,311
Rym: You know what more any excess merchandise company was doing.

206
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:56,034
Rym: that it a note.

207
00:13:56,114 --> 00:13:57,940
Rym: a couple Otakon's back and they got kicked out.

208
00:13:58,381 --> 00:13:59,144
Scott: How did they find out?

209
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:00,208
Rym: they have Pete.

210
00:14:00,228 --> 00:14:03,440
Rym: they have undercover people looking around and people will report stuff.

211
00:14:03,822 --> 00:14:05,850
Rym: So I assume some kids saw it reported to the staff.

212
00:14:05,871 --> 00:14:07,538
Rym: staff came over and hate bootlegs.

213
00:14:07,819 --> 00:14:10,708
Rym: Oh Asset, what do you mean ass head?

214
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:12,053
Rym: I'm fairly against bootlegs.

215
00:14:12,314 --> 00:14:15,546
Scott: Well, yeah, but I mean at the same time It's like the code of the schoolyard.

216
00:14:15,927 --> 00:14:19,880
Scott: Nah, nah, you know, you don't tell on people you let him get caught on their own.

217
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,746
Rym: I tell on people.

218
00:14:21,007 --> 00:14:22,699
Rym: I told on some punk kids on the train once.

219
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:24,164
Scott: Where were they doing?

220
00:14:24,426 --> 00:14:27,300
Rym: They ripped down one of the emergency signs because it's glow-in-the-dark.

221
00:14:28,341 --> 00:14:35,288
Rym: And then the conductor came over and I just said hey those kids ripped down the emergency sign That's supposed to be there and I watched hilarity ensue.

222
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:36,472
Scott: Where'd the community do?

223
00:14:36,713 --> 00:14:38,880
Rym: He yelled at him and then this parent came over.

224
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,146
Rym: Why are you yelling at my kid?

225
00:14:40,508 --> 00:14:42,960
Rym: and then the conductor's like her kid just damaged train property?

226
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:44,192
Rym: Yeah, I could cause you call the police.

227
00:14:44,252 --> 00:14:45,040
Rym: It was just hilarious.

228
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,808
Rym: Uh Yeah, I was proud of that.

229
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:48,532
Rym: punk kids.

230
00:14:48,592 --> 00:14:49,920
Rym: I'm no longer a punk kid now.

231
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,858
Rym: I'm the crotchety old man who gets the punk kid in trouble.

232
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:55,608
Scott: Punk kids and crotchety old man eternal enemies.

233
00:14:55,909 --> 00:15:02,144
Scott: We need to make a video game about crotchety old men versus punk kids And you can be either side.

234
00:15:02,465 --> 00:15:09,987
Scott: In fact, it's you a multiplayer online game massively multiplayer massively multiplayer online game Crotchety old men versus punk kids.

235
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:13,617
Scott: Of course, you can only own property if you're a old man.

236
00:15:13,637 --> 00:15:18,315
Scott: you get this giant lawn And the punk kids try to invade it, but they have weapons and you don't so.

237
00:15:18,616 --> 00:15:22,075
Scott: but you do have a lawn And a law, you know cops.

238
00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:28,340
Scott: Yep But the cops are all NPCs And they eventually can get mad at you if you call them too often.

239
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,027
Rym: Why don't we just make a progress quest extension?

240
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:31,830
Rym: that does this game?

241
00:15:32,191 --> 00:15:32,612
Scott: Perfect.

242
00:15:33,414 --> 00:15:34,577
Scott: Speaking of progress quest.

243
00:15:34,718 --> 00:15:37,663
Scott: I'm currently level 27 outstanding.

244
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:38,625
Scott: Yeah, great.

245
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:49,606
Scott: I don't know how many of our listeners are familiar with the concept of Super doll fee.

246
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:55,705
Rym: it's uh, if any of you are into it, that's cool But I personally find it a little scary and a little creepy.

247
00:15:56,366 --> 00:15:57,287
Scott: It is very scary.

248
00:15:57,307 --> 00:16:07,415
Rym: Basically what super doll fee is is I'll warn you if you try to define what super doll fee is in any way Anyone who knows what they're talking about is gonna jump down your throat in the forums.

249
00:16:07,837 --> 00:16:09,645
Scott: They'll find you Yeah, you know what?

250
00:16:10,006 --> 00:16:12,639
Scott: They're scary because they like super doll fee so they can shove it.

251
00:16:13,061 --> 00:16:24,560
Scott: so it's basically these ball-jointed dolls and they make clothing and Stuff for them and they cut their hair and color their hair and it's like a super customizable doll.

252
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:32,624
Scott: Usually they make them look like j-rockers and make them like j-rockers anime characters, whatever they want, you know And it's kind of freaky.

253
00:16:33,186 --> 00:16:35,553
Scott: You'll see him sometimes in your artist alley or something.

254
00:16:36,536 --> 00:16:39,348
Scott: And yeah, they're generally Something you don't want

255
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:39,974
Scott: to get involved in

256
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:42,284
Rym: Unless you're really into that sort of thing.

257
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:44,029
Rym: I mean, I don't begrudge anyone having a hobby.

258
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:49,104
Rym: just Be warned that if you're really into super doll fee I might find you a little creepy.

259
00:16:49,605 --> 00:16:55,030
Scott: Yeah, not to mention the fact It's really the money that makes it the most creepy and the amount of time spent on it.

260
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:55,572
Rym: You know what?

261
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:58,585
Rym: It is about as addictive and time-consuming as Warhammer is.

262
00:17:00,392 --> 00:17:03,182
Scott: Yeah, it's about equal to that Warhammer at least.

263
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:10,323
Scott: there's a good game in Warhammer, you know Unlike some CCGs like magic or whatever or the penny arcade collectible card game.

264
00:17:10,343 --> 00:17:13,069
Scott: Yeah, Warhammer is actually a somewhat decent game.

265
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:16,747
Scott: So there's something to it, you know super doll fee is just nothing.

266
00:17:17,128 --> 00:17:18,597
Rym: It's like Warhammer wasn't a game.

267
00:17:21,554 --> 00:17:24,529
Rym: Um, I know I submit that there are people out there for whom it is not a game.

268
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:25,973
Scott: That is true.

269
00:17:26,032 --> 00:17:27,496
Scott: And those people are equally scary.

270
00:17:27,556 --> 00:17:28,277
Scott: So yes.

271
00:17:28,758 --> 00:17:32,117
Scott: Anyway, put that aside You can customize.

272
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:37,310
Scott: super doll fees are made for customization But some dolls are not such as Barbie.

273
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:39,636
Scott: But some people have

274
00:17:39,656 --> 00:17:41,442
Scott: decided to customize Barbie anyway,

275
00:17:41,984 --> 00:17:43,690
Rym: and they made Barbie into an

276
00:17:44,371 --> 00:17:44,960
Scott: otaku,

277
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,163
Rym: haha.

278
00:17:46,292 --> 00:17:50,645
Scott: so here you will see someone who has customized Barbie into otaku.

279
00:17:50,665 --> 00:17:55,429
Scott: Barbie she has a T-shirt with one of Hello Kitty's friends on it.

280
00:17:56,031 --> 00:18:02,250
Rym: The fact that she has the little sketchbook with the little somewhat poorly drawn anime style sketch on it is just classic.

281
00:18:02,612 --> 00:18:21,029
Scott: Yeah, I think she also has like a little like a Japanese snack and a j-pop CD and a little bag of a little artist thingy a little portfolio bag and You know, she's totally drawing all sorts of little anime arts on a very Barbie sized sketchbook.

282
00:18:22,372 --> 00:18:28,189
Rym: You know with a little bit of editing Scott I could make a podcast where basically it's just you talking about how awesome this Barbie doll is.

283
00:18:29,092 --> 00:18:38,436
Scott: Yeah, well, that's not good because the last thing the Barbie does is transform into magical Barbie Sailor Senshi Woot, which is ultra frightening.

284
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,510
Rym: I submit that the cross-dressing Ken is slightly more frustrating.

285
00:18:42,732 --> 00:18:43,860
Scott: I was gonna keep that a secret.

286
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,276
Scott: So if you would go to the site and see it Oh, well, you know what.

287
00:18:46,317 --> 00:18:48,289
Rym: go to the site and see the cross-dressing Ken.

288
00:18:48,491 --> 00:18:52,050
Scott: Yeah, so at the bottom of the site is worse than otaku Barbie.

289
00:18:53,211 --> 00:19:02,142
Scott: It's cross play Ken and it's Ken with the tiara dressed like Sailor Moon And he's got a freaking beer belly and it's frightening.

290
00:19:02,383 --> 00:19:04,510
Rym: Hey, it's no Sailor Bubba bobblehead.

291
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:08,182
Scott: No, it's not a Sailor Bubba bobblehead, but why don't those exist?

292
00:19:08,223 --> 00:19:09,407
Scott: they would sell like hotcakes.

293
00:19:09,428 --> 00:19:10,010
Rym: they do exist.

294
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,275
Rym: They were sold at anime central.

295
00:19:11,637 --> 00:19:12,259
Scott: Where do we get them?

296
00:19:13,264 --> 00:19:14,830
Rym: I didn't get one, but I saw them there.

297
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:22,410
Scott: I've been anime essentially where the official bobbleheads made by the bobblehead company or they knock off I don't know cuz the real bobbleheads have like ceramic heads.

298
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:28,150
Rym: See, all I know is the only place I really saw Sailor Bubba with any degree of regularity was anime central.

299
00:19:28,654 --> 00:19:29,684
Scott: I saw him at an Otakon.

300
00:19:29,805 --> 00:19:32,876
Rym: Yeah He's not at every Otakon.

301
00:19:32,936 --> 00:19:33,418
Scott: No, he's not.

302
00:19:34,202 --> 00:19:36,050
Rym: he was at every anime central for a while.

303
00:19:36,271 --> 00:19:38,543
Scott: He's you know, he's not really as big now.

304
00:19:38,603 --> 00:19:39,990
Scott: It's like Jewish wolf would took his spot.

305
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:42,558
Rym: And all you mean Mike Pfeffer.

306
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:44,789
Scott: Yeah, I wonder if he listens to us after he was on.

307
00:19:45,232 --> 00:19:45,593
Rym: I don't know.

308
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,066
Rym: So Mike Pfeffer, do you still listen to GeekNights?

309
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:52,249
Rym: Yeah If you don't we're gonna keep calling you Jewish wolf would.

310
00:19:53,811 --> 00:19:55,850
Scott: Yeah, he really doesn't like being called Jewish wolf.

311
00:19:56,232 --> 00:20:00,610
Rym: Well, I think it's more that Jewish wolf would was something that made him really like well-known and popular.

312
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:03,061
Rym: But it's not the thing he wants to be remembered for.

313
00:20:03,081 --> 00:20:06,334
Scott: he wants to be remembered for being awesome And he is kind of awesome.

314
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:11,370
Rym: So he's really digging up that off Communist Party of anime thing, which I find fairly hilarious.

315
00:20:11,952 --> 00:20:15,828
Scott: Yes, so, um, we'll definitely hook up with him at some con in the future.

316
00:20:16,671 --> 00:20:18,217
Scott: Maybe maybe bring him on the show again.

317
00:20:18,237 --> 00:20:21,490
Rym: Yeah, maybe we'll get him here so we can use the real equipment.

318
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,008
Rym: You can hear what his voice actually sounds like.

319
00:20:26,311 --> 00:20:28,401
Rym: All right, so my thing of the day.

320
00:20:28,421 --> 00:20:38,407
Rym: I had some other thing of the day which is actually kind of cool And then I decided to look in my delicious for some news and I realized that a while ago I had put something in my delicious and then forgotten about it.

321
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:40,425
Scott: Now that's the point of delicious.

322
00:20:40,808 --> 00:20:50,523
Rym: now all of you are familiar with bleach because you're all listening to the anime portion of GeekNights and bleach is One of the new popular shows like Naruto or Yu Yu Hakusho.

323
00:20:50,704 --> 00:20:52,510
Scott: It's a shonen action fighting show.

324
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:56,142
Scott: It follows the already know you already know my opinion of these shows.

325
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:58,670
Rym: it follows the formula of here's some awesome characters.

326
00:20:59,151 --> 00:21:00,295
Rym: Oh, here's an awesome story.

327
00:21:00,756 --> 00:21:02,181
Rym: Oh five episodes have gone by.

328
00:21:02,381 --> 00:21:03,545
Rym: Well, fuck that story.

329
00:21:03,746 --> 00:21:05,474
Rym: Let's have them fight for the next 3,000 episodes.

330
00:21:07,234 --> 00:21:09,510
Scott: That's exactly the definition of shonen action.

331
00:21:09,872 --> 00:21:15,481
Rym: I mean the characters are really kind of cute and cool and if it weren't for the fact that it's just a fighting show I'd Be all about it, but I'm sorry.

332
00:21:15,622 --> 00:21:16,449
Rym: It's just a fighting show.

333
00:21:16,591 --> 00:21:17,709
Scott: Yeah, it's like Yu Yu Hakusho.

334
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:26,021
Scott: You know the first two episodes like this amazing plot these funny characters and then oh We're gonna have a giant tournament Naruto ninja school.

335
00:21:26,563 --> 00:21:28,690
Rym: forget that ninja school ninja school was hilarious.

336
00:21:29,174 --> 00:21:31,310
Rym: And then suddenly they're fighting and in tournaments.

337
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:37,170
Scott: Don't do you realize that they just took the first few episodes and dragged it out to be a 26 episode show?

338
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,174
Scott: It would be amazing.

339
00:21:38,234 --> 00:21:40,604
Scott: But when they just start a fighting show instead, it sucks.

340
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:41,910
Rym: It sucks to us.

341
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,160
Rym: I find out that a lot of people like it.

342
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,150
Scott: I Don't know what's up with it.

343
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:49,130
Scott: Well, I gotta admit when I watch Naruto the first time it's something about these shows.

344
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:52,665
Scott: We're like like rave master was another one that you don't realize.

345
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:53,890
Rym: it's a fighting show right away.

346
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,576
Scott: You don't realize the fighting show you've.

347
00:21:56,078 --> 00:21:57,684
Scott: you've gotten to the 13th episode.

348
00:21:57,704 --> 00:22:09,269
Scott: when they finally finished the fight You realize this is the 13th episode and then you go back and you look and you say hey this fights been going on since episode 5. oh I'm not watching anymore.

349
00:22:10,892 --> 00:22:14,710
Scott: You know, it's like it tricks you and as soon as you realize it you're you're safe.

350
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:24,030
Scott: But you know, I don't know they have some sort of magic formula so you don't figure it out Though part of the reason bleach is slightly more interesting to me is that she'll probably embarrassed.

351
00:22:24,171 --> 00:22:30,639
Rym: I'm not gonna say who she is, but we have a friend who looks exactly Like Rukia from the show.

352
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:32,930
Scott: I don't know which character that is, but I'll look it up later.

353
00:22:33,412 --> 00:22:35,846
Rym: Well, she looks exactly like the person I'm talking about.

354
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:38,817
Rym: All right But like it's creepy.

355
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,010
Rym: She does a cosplay and she might as well be the character.

356
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:52,350
Scott: There are lots of people, you know who could pretty much be any cat, you know certain characters, yeah, but anyway Bleach is very popular and I discovered I'm not exactly sure what this is.

357
00:22:52,430 --> 00:23:03,067
Rym: I think it's just the promo for something that someone wants to do or maybe they're making a musical But it's basically a bleach rock opera live action.

358
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:06,836
Scott: That reminds me of the utenna pull a musical.

359
00:23:06,856 --> 00:23:13,100
Rym: All right, the utenna is Utenna and captain Tyler are my favorite two anime ever.

360
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:17,500
Rym: I think Howie bebop is one of the best anime ever but Tyler and utenna are like near and dear to me.

361
00:23:17,742 --> 00:23:25,740
Rym: I could to go down to the infinite Horrible fanboy detail on all the various intricacies of utenna and I love everything to tenor involved.

362
00:23:25,941 --> 00:23:28,012
Scott: That's almost as scary as a super dolphin.

363
00:23:28,434 --> 00:23:33,379
Rym: the utenna musical Made me want to claw my own eyes out and then kill myself with them.

364
00:23:34,244 --> 00:23:36,053
Scott: I think we had a tape somewhere that had like a few.

365
00:23:36,154 --> 00:23:37,380
Rym: I still have that tape.

366
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:39,131
Rym: It has most of the musical on it.

367
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:40,440
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty frightening.

368
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:46,096
Rym: It's like a fifth generation fan sub that's barely watchable of the last episode of utenna.

369
00:23:46,457 --> 00:23:48,364
Rym: and then the musical Here.

370
00:23:48,404 --> 00:23:54,567
Scott: to give you an example of what watching the utenna musical is like Imagine some people doing in utenna cosplay.

371
00:23:55,088 --> 00:24:04,000
Scott: They're seriously trying to act out what happens in the show But they're singing poorly and they have a slightly higher production value.

372
00:24:04,502 --> 00:24:08,220
Rym: Yeah, so just take a typical cosplay sketch and knock it up a notch.

373
00:24:09,102 --> 00:24:09,724
Scott: Not good.

374
00:24:10,045 --> 00:24:13,554
Scott: Yeah, especially since it's not one of those funny clever cosplay sketches.

375
00:24:13,654 --> 00:24:15,740
Scott: It's trying to be realistic cosplay sketch.

376
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:16,744
Rym: Yeah, it was definitely.

377
00:24:16,824 --> 00:24:19,975
Rym: no the Muppets do antenna, which is one of the funniest things I've ever seen.

378
00:24:20,196 --> 00:24:26,040
Scott: Yeah, so, um The bleach Iraq opera here is it's kind of cool.

379
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,388
Rym: I got to admit it that I kind of like the music.

380
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:30,615
Scott: the production seems pretty good.

381
00:24:30,675 --> 00:24:32,039
Scott: The music is average to me.

382
00:24:32,581 --> 00:24:35,531
Rym: Well, it sounds like the music would be good if someone better we're singing it.

383
00:24:36,193 --> 00:24:38,140
Scott: it seems to represent the show pretty well.

384
00:24:38,381 --> 00:24:39,566
Rym: Yeah, people are fighting.

385
00:24:40,048 --> 00:24:40,871
Rym: There's Shinigami.

386
00:24:40,891 --> 00:24:42,016
Rym: Mm-hmm.

387
00:24:42,036 --> 00:24:42,839
Rym: No, they're fighting again.

388
00:24:43,821 --> 00:24:44,867
Scott: Yep, that's pretty accurate.

389
00:24:45,329 --> 00:24:45,410
Rym: Now.

390
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,918
Rym: The thing is I mean, I like the music.

391
00:24:46,978 --> 00:24:58,560
Rym: the problem the problem with this thing just seems to be that either they pulled the classic musical mistake of Hiring people who look good instead of people who can sing or these are just stand-ins and they're like trying to promote this thing.

392
00:24:58,982 --> 00:24:59,905
Rym: I'm really not sure.

393
00:24:59,926 --> 00:25:01,733
Rym: I haven't done any research on this.

394
00:25:01,813 --> 00:25:03,179
Rym: I just watched the clip and you should do.

395
00:25:03,642 --> 00:25:14,372
Scott: Yeah, I can't tell I'm not Japanese or anything but if you like bleach or if you know what bleach is you should probably watch this little video and You'll either laugh or cry or something.

396
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:15,858
Scott: It'll be worth your time.

397
00:25:16,078 --> 00:25:21,320
Rym: Yeah So anyway, it's anime day and it's also how to not suck week.

398
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:39,560
Rym: Now we realized that all of the topics we could really cover how to not suck that involve anime are very very specific topics that many of you probably don't care about like How to not suck at running a panel at a convention or how to not suck at running an anime club?

399
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,369
Rym: Or how to not suck at collecting comics.

400
00:25:42,811 --> 00:25:45,420
Scott: Yeah, you already did how to not suck at a convention.

401
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,238
Rym: I think well, we did three episodes on how to be good at a convention.

402
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:52,520
Scott: basically Well, how to not suck is just our way of saying how to be good.

403
00:25:52,580 --> 00:26:00,760
Scott: But yeah, I guess we could do how to not suck at being an anime artist But all we'd have to say is go to art school and practice because we don't freaking know shit about art.

404
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:02,708
Rym: Yeah, I can't draw a straight line.

405
00:26:02,889 --> 00:26:07,164
Scott: I can draw a stick figure happy one - yeah, you can Mean stick figure.

406
00:26:07,384 --> 00:26:07,726
Scott: Yeah.

407
00:26:08,468 --> 00:26:08,548
Scott: Sure.

408
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:21,870
Rym: So we decided partly because we're still very tired from the weekend We're just gonna do a very quick how to not suck at being a fan In other words how to not be a horrible fanboy.

409
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:32,077
Scott: Yep, because a lot of people out there, you know I mean there are some things there were There are some people who are fanboys and proud of it like the comic book guy in The Simpsons.

410
00:26:32,177 --> 00:26:33,000
Rym: No, that's fine.

411
00:26:33,281 --> 00:26:37,036
Rym: I mean if you're that dude go ahead and be that dude all the way.

412
00:26:37,518 --> 00:26:43,920
Scott: Yeah, basically I don't want to come near you, but I'll respect the way you do things and I'll stay clear and it'll be all good.

413
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:51,720
Rym: Yeah We're also not gonna talk about taste in anime because you're allowed to like whatever you want and whatever Our opinions may be whatever even though our opinions are correct.

414
00:26:52,767 --> 00:27:10,500
Rym: Okay But anyway, all we really want to talk about here because we don't want to sound like assholes more so than we already are are Just things that you can probably try to avoid Because these are the kind of things that a fanboy does and maybe doesn't realize they're doing or doesn't realize that it's annoying to others.

415
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:21,535
Scott: Yeah, I mean there are a lot of people I'll run into at conventions where they'll be normal cool guys for the most part But they'll have something about them or they'll have a certain way about them.

416
00:27:21,575 --> 00:27:22,518
Scott: That is totally like.

417
00:27:22,538 --> 00:27:26,919
Scott: alright You need to get away from me now You know, it's an odor.

418
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:29,667
Scott: Odor is the first thing on the list.

419
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:33,500
Rym: Alright, so, uh, if you like anime, that's fine.

420
00:27:34,463 --> 00:27:37,011
Rym: If you have bo I don't care if you like anime or not.

421
00:27:37,272 --> 00:27:38,095
Rym: That's not fine.

422
00:27:38,436 --> 00:27:39,038
Rym: Don't have it.

423
00:27:39,339 --> 00:27:41,525
Scott: Yes There are two places you have to worry about.

424
00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:41,987
Scott: bo.

425
00:27:42,608 --> 00:27:44,153
Scott: number one anyplace crowded.

426
00:27:44,594 --> 00:27:49,633
Scott: if it's crowded and you're not wearing deodorant Or any purse print which I don't recommend wearing any purse print ever.

427
00:27:49,894 --> 00:27:51,100
Rym: Yeah, we'll get into that later.

428
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,128
Rym: We'll do a whole show in some other episode.

429
00:27:53,248 --> 00:27:54,111
Scott: Yeah hygiene.

430
00:27:54,292 --> 00:27:55,838
Scott: We already did this one hygiene show.

431
00:27:55,858 --> 00:27:56,360
Scott: we can do another.

432
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:04,428
Rym: well It's very simple if you're at a con or an anime club or out in public right your favorite store one Take a shower at least every other day.

433
00:28:04,709 --> 00:28:04,970
Rym: Come on.

434
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:08,160
Rym: That's all I'm asking - in the summer every day.

435
00:28:08,401 --> 00:28:11,080
Rym: Yeah deodorant deodorant deodorant deodorant.

436
00:28:11,943 --> 00:28:17,054
Rym: if you don't own deodorant or You don't know how to use it or you own it but you're not using it.

437
00:28:17,456 --> 00:28:18,340
Rym: you're not a good person.

438
00:28:18,741 --> 00:28:19,986
Rym: In fact, you're a very bad person.

439
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:21,933
Scott: Also, make sure you're showering properly.

440
00:28:22,013 --> 00:28:23,880
Scott: Just getting yourself wet and getting out is no good.

441
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,271
Scott: You need to wash your hair with shampoo and clean your body with soap.

442
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:35,339
Rym: in the very least go by George Carlin's method of showering armpits asshole crotch and teeth in that order.

443
00:28:37,961 --> 00:28:40,169
Rym: Actually, I think you want to do it in the.

444
00:28:40,189 --> 00:28:43,220
Scott: you know what I think he said in the order George Carlin.

445
00:28:43,862 --> 00:28:44,946
Rym: George Carlin made a joke cuz.

446
00:28:44,986 --> 00:28:51,429
Rym: then he said in the same order or in that order with the same brush Mmm, yeah, cuz he's George Carlin.

447
00:28:51,449 --> 00:28:53,880
Rym: Mm-hmm, but wash the crucial areas.

448
00:28:54,281 --> 00:29:00,964
Rym: I mean, I don't know how many times I've been to a con and I've been floored by someone like Floored as in.

449
00:29:01,044 --> 00:29:03,960
Rym: I can't imagine how that odor could come from a still-living human being.

450
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:07,592
Scott: Yeah, especially if you're at you know, I guess convention.

451
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,140
Scott: we could talk about conventions more great.

452
00:29:09,401 --> 00:29:16,595
Scott: Yeah, well anime clubs anime clubs and make let you walk it around all day or you're in a crowded room of people and it's Hot and you're starting to sweat.

453
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:18,364
Rym: Not even just anime.

454
00:29:18,565 --> 00:29:24,399
Rym: if you're a comic guy and you leave your den of misery once a week to buy your comics on Wednesday That should be the day you shower.

455
00:29:25,783 --> 00:29:27,679
Rym: If you're gonna shower once a week make that the day.

456
00:29:27,981 --> 00:29:30,514
Scott: Yeah, you know, you got to look good when you go that comic book store.

457
00:29:30,534 --> 00:29:31,720
Scott: The owner will be friendlier to you.

458
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,746
Scott: Maybe give you a discount.

459
00:29:33,048 --> 00:29:34,980
Scott: Yeah, you gotta think about these sort of things course?

460
00:29:35,135 --> 00:29:41,834
Rym: I Think some of these comic people Use the BO as a defense because they walk into the store.

461
00:29:42,075 --> 00:29:42,898
Rym: people back off.

462
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:49,593
Scott: now They can get the comics they want without having to shove through the crowd perhaps but a lot of the crazy calm people have like Pre-orders, they don't need to shove through.

463
00:29:49,613 --> 00:29:50,320
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

464
00:29:51,766 --> 00:29:58,657
Scott: Okay, number two Don't keep talking to someone if they don't seem to be like responding to you.

465
00:29:58,677 --> 00:30:04,600
Rym: I mean Basically, I was the president of the biggest anime club in the country for a year.

466
00:30:05,162 --> 00:30:16,940
Rym: I was on the board for three years and one of my many duties was being very polite and civil to people in public Meaning I had to always be nice to everyone no matter what because they're a member of this club and they're a member.

467
00:30:17,101 --> 00:30:21,659
Scott: I have to take care of them and I was the guy who got to say wow, you're a fanboy go away now.

468
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,105
Rym: Tacked is a very beautiful thing.

469
00:30:24,345 --> 00:30:29,640
Rym: And if a fanboy is really bothering me, I usually won't tell him exactly what I think of him.

470
00:30:30,423 --> 00:30:30,724
Rym: I won't.

471
00:30:30,845 --> 00:30:32,090
Rym: you know, I I just I'm very not.

472
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,480
Rym: I don't like to destroy someone's ego.

473
00:30:35,602 --> 00:30:36,807
Scott: I will if necessary.

474
00:30:37,028 --> 00:30:40,240
Scott: Yeah, it's not really pleasant, but I guess too much effort.

475
00:30:40,461 --> 00:30:40,601
Scott: it's

476
00:30:40,621 --> 00:30:54,040
Rym: a warning out there to people that if something if you're talking to someone and they keep looking away from you or not making eye Contact or they keep turning to their other friends or all they ever do when you say anything to them is go like

477
00:30:55,405 --> 00:30:55,990
Scott: Or yep.

478
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:00,663
Rym: Ah Yeah I got real good at Pretending.

479
00:31:00,724 --> 00:31:03,180
Rym: I'm paying attention to someone in those three years of running that clean.

480
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:09,510
Scott: Here's the thing is this if I'm talking to someone and all they say is uh-huh Yep, and they're not looking at me or something.

481
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:09,811
Scott: I go.

482
00:31:10,032 --> 00:31:10,213
Scott: Hey.

483
00:31:10,394 --> 00:31:11,579
Scott: Hey, are you paying attention to me?

484
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,650
Scott: Yeah, I don't even want to hear what I'm saying.

485
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:30,247
Rym: now Scott's a little weird I mean when it comes to that because basically one time we're we used to share a room in college and Just because we had a tiny little ass apartment and I'm laying in my bed I'm trying to sleep and Scott's trying to tell me something and all I remember is he stopped talking and he said like alright And I said and then he kept talking.

486
00:31:30,307 --> 00:31:39,662
Rym: then he said alright again and I didn't say anything and he said I'll write again And again, and then he said hey, hey, Ram Ram You're listening.

487
00:31:39,682 --> 00:31:43,130
Rym: Yeah, and then eventually realized that I wasn't listening.

488
00:31:44,342 --> 00:31:47,275
Rym: Yeah, well and then he woke me up, but that's a whole other issue.

489
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:58,573
Scott: Well the point is if I'm talking it's because I'm trying to communicate information to someone else and if I in some cases You know, I only want to communicate it if they want to hear it.

490
00:31:59,276 --> 00:32:02,300
Scott: and if they don't want to hear it I want to make sure that they don't want to hear it or not.

491
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:05,380
Scott: So I do so and if they don't want to then I won't tell them anymore.

492
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:13,340
Rym: So basically if you're at a con or at an anime club or out in public and you're trying to tell someone about this is this Is huge when waiting in lines for nerdy?

493
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,929
Rym: Yes, because you're stuck with the people you're waiting in line with.

494
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,840
Rym: and I've been stuck in some lines with people.

495
00:32:19,301 --> 00:32:32,611
Scott: I've been sucking some lines with some people and the trend seems to be there'll be a group that you'll be next to and the Group often contains a bunch of normal guys and then a cool guy or a loner Don't want to be in line next to loners.

496
00:32:32,711 --> 00:32:34,220
Scott: always get in lines next to groups.

497
00:32:34,521 --> 00:32:35,305
Scott: It's much more.

498
00:32:35,365 --> 00:32:36,511
Rym: by all means be friendly.

499
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:38,480
Rym: try to meet people hang out with people talk to people.

500
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,022
Rym: Don't be afraid.

501
00:32:39,043 --> 00:32:42,679
Rym: just walk over to someone and talk to them like hey, I like Dragon Ball you like Dragon Ball, too.

502
00:32:43,241 --> 00:32:46,578
Rym: But if they obviously don't like Dragon Ball don't keep talking about it.

503
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:56,006
Scott: Especially don't talk about hentai or yaoi or anything weird like that at all unless you're sure That they want to hear about it.

504
00:32:56,026 --> 00:33:02,171
Scott: I mean you start talking about hentai and to me I will I will put you down solo.

505
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:03,857
Scott: You want to kill your fury.

506
00:33:03,897 --> 00:33:04,720
Scott: You'll want to kill yourself.

507
00:33:05,042 --> 00:33:07,219
Scott: I'll be like wow, you're a perverted scumbag.

508
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:08,303
Rym: Yeah, like we have.

509
00:33:08,524 --> 00:33:13,760
Rym: uh, are we have a friend who's really into yaoi like really into yaoi and you know what?

510
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,623
Rym: We're fine with that.

511
00:33:14,643 --> 00:33:18,880
Rym: Okay, and usually when she tells us about yaoi, it always ends up being a funny story.

512
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,596
Rym: So we want to hear it and it's obvious we want to hear it, but we had a friend.

513
00:33:22,616 --> 00:33:23,400
Rym: Well, not a friend.

514
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:32,793
Rym: There was a person we knew at RIT when we were there who would follow us around and Interject himself into conversations to explain what kinds of hentai he liked.

515
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:34,478
Rym: I'm not exaggerating.

516
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:39,977
Rym: Yeah I mean, you know what our conversation was like, hey Rym you want to go to the anime club tonight?

517
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:41,705
Rym: Hey Scott Yeah, that'd be fine.

518
00:33:42,268 --> 00:33:43,254
Rym: Hey Rym and Scott.

519
00:33:43,576 --> 00:33:45,984
Rym: I just watched Disembowelment hentai.

520
00:33:46,165 --> 00:33:47,792
Rym: It's my favorite kind of hentai.

521
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:49,379
Rym: What kind of hentai do you like?

522
00:33:51,203 --> 00:33:53,619
Scott: Uh, no kind go away, yeah.

523
00:33:54,881 --> 00:33:57,690
Scott: But I mean, it's like the person we know that likes yaoi.

524
00:33:57,931 --> 00:33:59,014
Scott: when she talks about yaoi.

525
00:33:59,074 --> 00:34:01,883
Scott: It's always like oh my god There's a relevant yaoi.

526
00:34:01,903 --> 00:34:05,314
Scott: That's hilarious or you know, haha funny joke.

527
00:34:05,575 --> 00:34:06,238
Scott: It's never like.

528
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:12,199
Scott: hey Do you want to come you know, see my favorite yaoi and then explaining the yaoi one time it was bad?

529
00:34:12,482 --> 00:34:15,340
Scott: But the thing is she no, I guess I wasn't there that time.

530
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:22,280
Rym: Yeah, she doesn't bring up the yaoi like out of the blue with no reason constantly because that just means you're trying to get attention.

531
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,128
Rym: Yeah, but she brings up when it's relevant.

532
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:33,967
Rym: if if we're like at dick and busters Whatever hentai dubbing panel at Otakon or something because I hear that's hilarious and you start talking to me about the funny hentai We're watching that's cool.

533
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:35,500
Scott: Yeah, that's it's informative.

534
00:34:35,721 --> 00:34:41,458
Rym: But if I'm walking down the street and you start telling me about your tentacle yaoi, I'm gonna hit you with a tentacle.

535
00:34:42,841 --> 00:34:44,908
Rym: You don't have a tentacle or do I?

536
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:48,300
Rym: ha ha we made a joke that was about a penis.

537
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:50,967
Rym: That never happens on GeekNights.

538
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:51,851
Scott: Yeah.

539
00:34:52,393 --> 00:34:55,306
Rym: All right now Anime clubs out there.

540
00:34:55,768 --> 00:34:58,400
Rym: basically, it's tough to have an anime club.

541
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,220
Rym: That's just about watching the anime because you know, you just watch the anime in your room.

542
00:35:01,542 --> 00:35:03,916
Rym: That's the argument that fanboys make at least now.

543
00:35:04,198 --> 00:35:13,343
Rym: to me Some watching anime in a group can often be one of the greatest experiences of an anime because they can turn a mediocre anime Awesome.

544
00:35:13,784 --> 00:35:14,987
Scott: All right now think about this.

545
00:35:15,067 --> 00:35:16,992
Scott: right you watch a show.

546
00:35:17,113 --> 00:35:24,989
Scott: Let's say it's a ridiculously crazy funny show like Excel Saga Or something else like that Genji Ken show.

547
00:35:25,029 --> 00:35:25,592
Scott: that's sort of new.

548
00:35:25,652 --> 00:35:27,520
Rym: Yeah, or like an old Lupin movie.

549
00:35:27,922 --> 00:35:31,700
Scott: Now when you watch these shows by yourself, you know, it's kind of funny.

550
00:35:32,681 --> 00:35:47,779
Scott: There's just something when you watch it in a room full of people where people yell out funny things or Every or you'll you know, because everyone is there paying attention that like if everyone starts laughing Maybe you'll notice a joke that you would have missed in your house.

551
00:35:48,422 --> 00:35:58,695
Rym: Or just that feeling of like something awesome happens like in an old Lupin movie Gee, Ken does something funny and crazy and everyone in the room goes Watching at home.

552
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,022
Scott: You don't even like get that.

553
00:36:00,082 --> 00:36:01,610
Scott: I don't know what it is or how it works.

554
00:36:01,671 --> 00:36:03,830
Scott: Maybe we should do a scientific study on how that you know.

555
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:08,650
Scott: The yeah the psychology of watching things in groups as opposed to watching the same exact thing alone.

556
00:36:08,871 --> 00:36:13,498
Rym: So first off I guess if there's an anime club in your area Go check it out and try to watch anime with people.

557
00:36:13,578 --> 00:36:14,682
Rym: You might enjoy it a lot more.

558
00:36:15,044 --> 00:36:19,310
Rym: don't discount an anime club Just because they don't show the newest fans of that you're watching right now.

559
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:26,032
Scott: Even watching an old show that you've already seen with a bunch of people can be greatly enhanced if those people do not suck Yes.

560
00:36:26,394 --> 00:36:33,509
Rym: Now this brings us to the critical point on how not to how to not suck number one If it's a serious part of a show.

561
00:36:34,242 --> 00:36:35,634
Rym: Shut up Unless now.

562
00:36:35,774 --> 00:36:38,786
Rym: keep in mind this all depends on the group you're with and you have to gauge the group.

563
00:36:39,107 --> 00:36:46,050
Rym: if you're sitting with a Bunch of people who just rip on everything and like everyone's cool with everyone just talking and yelling then by all means go in with that.

564
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:59,735
Rym: But if you're watching magical girl Y and her the boy She loves is about to stab her to death and it's this horrible dramatic scene and you crack a joke Loudly in the middle of a silent room where everyone's paying attention You suck.

565
00:37:00,096 --> 00:37:02,627
Scott: You definitely suck even though it's magical girl.

566
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:03,310
Scott: Why I don't care?

567
00:37:03,671 --> 00:37:19,690
Scott: yeah, so the second thing you want to do is if you have something funny to say and it is appropriate to yell something out like Let's say You know how sometimes in normal life someone will say something that leaves them wide open to a witty insult or a witty retort.

568
00:37:20,212 --> 00:37:23,549
Scott: Yes, sometimes an anime will say something that leaves someone wide open.

569
00:37:24,052 --> 00:37:27,930
Rym: You know like like the horrible yaoi innuendo and a show that has nothing to do with yaoi.

570
00:37:28,391 --> 00:37:36,390
Scott: Exactly now, you know before you yell out whatever you're about to yell out You can't delay too much because then it won't be funny.

571
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:42,149
Scott: So if you delay it if you hesitate at all more than like two seconds, don't say anything because people will go why you're too late.

572
00:37:43,112 --> 00:37:54,109
Scott: But do spend a half a second to make sure that you're laughing on the inside when you think about it or else Everyone will go Groan and throw things at you.

573
00:37:54,459 --> 00:37:56,878
Rym: Yeah And once again just pay attention to the crowd.

574
00:37:57,139 --> 00:38:00,793
Rym: if it's a bunch of people who like to watch their show silently don't yell funny Stuff out.

575
00:38:01,295 --> 00:38:03,024
Rym: Mm-hmm, because that's just not gonna work.

576
00:38:03,065 --> 00:38:03,829
Rym: People aren't gonna like you.

577
00:38:04,672 --> 00:38:08,565
Scott: the other thing is you know, let's say you know, you think about your thing for half a second.

578
00:38:08,706 --> 00:38:12,922
Scott: yell it out if Everyone groans don't try it again.

579
00:38:12,962 --> 00:38:13,906
Scott: You're not a funny person.

580
00:38:14,007 --> 00:38:17,250
Rym: Oh my god We had problems with that more than you could imagine.

581
00:38:17,871 --> 00:38:18,755
Scott: It's like that was always.

582
00:38:18,815 --> 00:38:24,808
Scott: my strategy is if there was something if it was appropriate for me to yell something out and I had Something funny to say I would go with it.

583
00:38:25,311 --> 00:38:32,279
Scott: And if people laughed I would wait until I got the next one and I would gauge that one in Myself against the previous one.

584
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,187
Scott: and if it was more funny, I'd let it loose.

585
00:38:34,327 --> 00:38:36,477
Scott: or equally funny I'd let it loose if it was less funny.

586
00:38:36,537 --> 00:38:37,542
Scott: I'd keep it in now.

587
00:38:37,602 --> 00:38:39,049
Rym: also don't be tricked by success.

588
00:38:39,532 --> 00:38:48,910
Rym: Say you yell something out and it's hilarious and like the whole room explodes with laughter Don't take that as a license to yell something out every five seconds for the rest of the anime because they'll kill you.

589
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:51,163
Scott: Yeah, you only yell something out when it like.

590
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:55,130
Scott: just comes to you, you know If you're trying to think of stuff to yell out you're in trouble.

591
00:38:55,752 --> 00:39:01,370
Scott: You have to just you know, sit there let it come let it cut the anime absorb into your body.

592
00:39:01,751 --> 00:39:07,010
Scott: And then whenever something hilarious just pops into your mind, you know gauge it really quickly and let it loose.

593
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:07,672
Scott: That's the.

594
00:39:07,773 --> 00:39:09,139
Scott: that's the the method.

595
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:09,380
Rym: Yep.

596
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:14,800
Rym: The rule here is when in doubt shut your pie hole Yep, or in the very least whisper to your friend next to you.

597
00:39:15,261 --> 00:39:20,950
Scott: and if your friend next to you starts laughing Maybe you can manage to do a little room spreading action.

598
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:28,386
Rym: Yeah That's often happened where something fun someone says something funny to me Ha ha ha and then the person on the other side goes, what did he just say?

599
00:39:28,406 --> 00:39:28,949
Rym: and I whisper it.

600
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:33,365
Rym: they go Ha ha ha and then it spreads to the whole room and there's like this rumbling laughter growing.

601
00:39:33,706 --> 00:39:33,947
Scott: Yep.

602
00:39:34,108 --> 00:39:42,089
Rym: That's a good one Alright, so last and least well I guess not least most for many people just because we don't want to you know Talk about fanboys for an hour here.

603
00:39:43,134 --> 00:39:44,228
Rym: It's not the most pleasant topic.

604
00:39:45,113 --> 00:39:56,768
Rym: But if you know the end of cowboy bebop and you know That the dude sitting next to you has never seen it or he just bought it and he's starting to watch it Don't tell him how it ends.

605
00:39:57,391 --> 00:40:06,489
Rym: In fact, don't tell anyone how anything ends unless you're sure they either want to know how it ends and don't care if you spoil It or that, you know, they've already seen it.

606
00:40:07,152 --> 00:40:11,906
Scott: Yep, and don't say endings to things loudly or in public places.

607
00:40:11,926 --> 00:40:17,230
Scott: or you know If you're telling it to a whole group Make sure every single person in the group is cool.

608
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:21,430
Scott: If one person's uncool either get them to leave the room or close their ears or something like that.

609
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:29,301
Rym: I mean This is one of the biggest ways to spot a horrible fanboy because we'll have a group of people and someone will say oh Man, the end of eska flown a when wait a minute.

610
00:40:29,321 --> 00:40:30,587
Rym: You've all seen eska flown a right?

611
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:31,270
Scott: Yep.

612
00:40:31,552 --> 00:40:37,062
Rym: And then if everyone says yeah, then they say whatever they're gonna say or other is they oh We'll talk about this later when so-and-so isn't here.

613
00:40:37,082 --> 00:40:37,524
Rym: Mm-hmm.

614
00:40:37,786 --> 00:40:38,248
Rym: That's just etiquette.

615
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:38,987
Rym: Yeah

616
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:59,422
Scott: and if you're in like a group of people and you're gonna watch something make sure that whatever you're gonna watch is appropriate for everyone who's in there in the room watching, you know, not in just in terms of you know Content but in terms of you know, we're gonna watch episode 13 of you know Crazy show that is very serial and well,

617
00:40:59,482 --> 00:41:02,330
Rym: you know, we're just fantastic at coming up with fake names for anime.

618
00:41:02,632 --> 00:41:06,477
Rym: We had magical girl why and crazy show Alright.

619
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:12,369
Rym: Alright, um Sad super robot 59 sad puppy snow angel sad boobies.

620
00:41:12,409 --> 00:41:16,871
Scott: No So if you're gonna watch to the 16th episode of super robot 59

621
00:41:16,871 --> 00:41:20,130
Rym: You know the one where Mickey gets his head chopped off and then everyone cries

622
00:41:20,572 --> 00:41:33,709
Scott: Yeah, and you know has the totally unexpected robot explosion, you know Don't watch that if people haven't seen one through whatever before that because then Now the whole show is kind of messed up for them.

623
00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:40,358
Rym: now It might be painful because we've had the full metal alchemist movie for a long time Just sitting here waiting to be listened to watched.

624
00:41:40,779 --> 00:41:42,706
Rym: Well, yeah watched I listened to.

625
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:44,010
Rym: I'm so used to talking about podcast.

626
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:46,196
Rym: I finally got out of saying watch what I mean.

627
00:41:46,216 --> 00:41:46,497
Rym: Listen.

628
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:47,620
Rym: now I say listen what I mean watch.

629
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:50,758
Scott: Yeah, just make your spotless and check and get on with it.

630
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,390
Rym: Haha, but my exponent is four but my shade is whites.

631
00:41:54,892 --> 00:41:56,337
Scott: Oh my god white run away.

632
00:41:56,418 --> 00:41:56,960
Rym: Haha.

633
00:41:57,522 --> 00:41:58,165
Rym: Yeah burning wheels.

634
00:41:58,245 --> 00:41:58,446
Rym: Awesome.

635
00:41:58,466 --> 00:42:01,130
Rym: We'll talk about that another show But anyway.

636
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:10,508
Rym: So we had a bunch of friends over like three separate times where we could have watched the movie as a big group But every time there was at least one person who hadn't seen the end of the show yet.

637
00:42:11,911 --> 00:42:15,810
Scott: And we're not even sure if the movie spoils anything, but I'm reasonably sure.

638
00:42:16,412 --> 00:42:17,837
Scott: Yeah, we're not a hundred percent sure though.

639
00:42:18,499 --> 00:42:20,807
Scott: So it's like because we're not sure we don't do it.

640
00:42:20,847 --> 00:42:27,127
Scott: You don't take risks Yeah, because I mean unless someone doesn't if someone doesn't care like go for it, you know Things I don't care about.

641
00:42:28,032 --> 00:42:29,497
Scott: Sometimes I want to be spoiled.

642
00:42:29,537 --> 00:42:38,145
Scott: if anyone is gonna tell me the end of fancy Lala and what the hell happens with those dinosaurs I'll give you a dollar Yeah, or you asked me to spoil scrap princess for you a while ago because you didn't want to watch it.

643
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:40,562
Scott: No, whatever I don't remember what you said, huh?

644
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:46,070
Rym: Of course can't be careful because there's always the caveat of the person who you know.

645
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:50,690
Rym: They'll say like they'll ask a question like they want to know the answer, but they don't really want to know.

646
00:42:52,391 --> 00:42:57,144
Rym: Generally don't answer that question or always at least preface it with a. Are you sure you want to know?

647
00:42:57,164 --> 00:43:00,285
Scott: yeah And that way if they didn't really want to know it's their own damn fault.

648
00:43:00,567 --> 00:43:06,228
Rym: cuz like Emily She's watching Last Exile right now, which we just watch all of and soon we're gonna do our final thoughts.

649
00:43:06,268 --> 00:43:09,544
Rym: episode on Yeah, I promised all of you out there have been asking.

650
00:43:09,886 --> 00:43:17,478
Rym: starting next week We're probably gonna start actually reviewing anime again because we've got a whole backlog of shows now Yeah, and even more episodes is sitting on the computer.

651
00:43:17,618 --> 00:43:19,684
Rym: Yeah, plus we're watching the original slayers again.

652
00:43:20,046 --> 00:43:20,366
Scott: Great.

653
00:43:20,527 --> 00:43:24,443
Rym: Yeah, I love it But she'll sometimes she'll ask like does he die?

654
00:43:24,604 --> 00:43:25,327
Rym: what happens to him?

655
00:43:25,749 --> 00:43:25,870
Rym: now?

656
00:43:26,131 --> 00:43:28,880
Rym: it's obvious that she doesn't actually want the answer to that question.

657
00:43:29,382 --> 00:43:30,968
Rym: a fanboy will immediately answer.

658
00:43:30,988 --> 00:43:33,174
Rym: a Non-fanboy will ask are you sure?

659
00:43:33,856 --> 00:43:40,033
Scott: the other thing is sometimes and this is a it doesn't take a lot of judgment skill But it takes some.

660
00:43:40,615 --> 00:43:42,601
Scott: there are sometimes it's okay to just tell all.

661
00:43:43,062 --> 00:43:50,949
Scott: there's nothing wrong with saying Luke Darth Vader is his father because everyone freaking knows and if they don't know hit him.

662
00:43:51,371 --> 00:43:54,761
Rym: Alright, I gotta tell the story about Greg and it does fake spoiler.

663
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:55,062
Rym: He did.

664
00:43:55,082 --> 00:43:57,670
Rym: Alright, cuz this is awesome our friend Greg.

665
00:43:58,032 --> 00:43:58,959
Rym: He told us this story.

666
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,917
Rym: We were with him, but apparently this happened And even if it didn't happen, it's a damn good story.

667
00:44:04,459 --> 00:44:07,489
Rym: So remember episode 2 of Star Wars when it came out.

668
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:12,205
Scott: You mean it was a. so episode 2 not Empire Strikes Back, but yeah the clone war.

669
00:44:12,246 --> 00:44:23,356
Rym: Yeah, the attack of the clones okay, so apparently he went to see it and On his way out because they saw like the midnight first showing there's a line of people Waiting for the second showing of it.

670
00:44:24,058 --> 00:44:32,600
Rym: So he starts talking and in a very loud voice says man that was awesome, but I can't believe they killed Yoda and This guy in the line goes.

671
00:44:32,862 --> 00:44:35,617
Rym: Thanks a lot asshole You just ruined the movie.

672
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:42,250
Rym: and then he realizes what he just said and That guy got pooned in a way that no man has ever been pooned before.

673
00:44:43,031 --> 00:44:43,273
Scott: Yep.

674
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:48,022
Rym: Yeah, and if you don't realize why that's funny, I Don't know what to say to you.

675
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:51,550
Scott: We have a Star Wars episode somewhere in the archives.

676
00:44:53,114 --> 00:44:54,128
Scott: You should go listen to it.

677
00:44:55,993 --> 00:45:01,460
Rym: Yeah, I had a thing of the day that was Star Wars related But I'll use it tomorrow if I don't find anything better tomorrow.

678
00:45:01,681 --> 00:45:02,524
Scott: Well, that's a quick one.

679
00:45:02,564 --> 00:45:03,767
Scott: We'll just let that loose whenever.

680
00:45:03,787 --> 00:45:12,730
Rym: yeah Geographically related to us Was oh, yeah, you know, I let it loose right now because we're devolving into the end of this episode.

681
00:45:13,192 --> 00:45:18,230
Rym: Okay, so a guy was caught selling crack near us in Poughkeepsie.

682
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:20,016
Scott: There's a lot of crack guys up there.

683
00:45:20,036 --> 00:45:20,438
Scott: Whatever.

684
00:45:20,498 --> 00:45:22,547
Rym: Yeah now now any guess what.

685
00:45:22,567 --> 00:45:27,297
Rym: his name was Lando Calrissian Butler.

686
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,829
Rym: his first name is Lando Calrissian.

687
00:45:30,612 --> 00:45:35,230
Scott: We're not sure if that was a misspelling by the newspaper and it's actually Lando Calrissian.

688
00:45:35,812 --> 00:45:41,858
Scott: Or maybe his parents didn't know how to spell Calrissian and they made it Carlesan or whatever they wrote there.

689
00:45:41,898 --> 00:45:44,449
Rym: or maybe he gave a fake name and they don't have an ID for it.

690
00:45:44,952 --> 00:45:47,430
Scott: What's your name Lando Calrissian Butler?

691
00:45:49,576 --> 00:45:50,169
Scott: That's my name.

00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:43,337
Rym: So I did some investigating and it seemed basically I've discovered that Right.

727
00:47:43,417 --> 00:47:57,527
Rym: when it screwed up is when Scott added all of the feed burner feeds that I had created for all the days of the week of GeekNights And I they're added in iTunes and Yahoo got really confused for a while about GeekNights.

728
00:47:57,988 --> 00:47:59,793
Scott: Yeah, whatever It doesn't matter.

729
00:47:59,913 --> 00:48:01,438
Scott: Yeah, not too many people use Yahoo!

730
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:04,668
Rym: Podcast, but I'll note we have over 20 subscribers through Yahoo!

731
00:48:04,688 --> 00:48:05,430
Rym: Podcast alone.

732
00:48:05,651 --> 00:48:08,901
Scott: Yep, but who knows how many of those subscribers actually like I got?

733
00:48:08,982 --> 00:48:10,145
Scott: I'm subscribed by Yahoo!

734
00:48:10,165 --> 00:48:11,510
Scott: Podcast, you know, it doesn't really.

735
00:48:12,591 --> 00:48:14,997
Scott: You know, it's not someone actually utilizing.

736
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:21,676
Rym: Well consider that the popular podcast on Yahoo have maybe maybe 40 subscribers there.

737
00:48:21,696 --> 00:48:24,444
Scott: So I'm telling you is that not too many people are actually using Yahoo!

738
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:25,507
Scott: Podcast seriously.

739
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:26,410
Rym: Oh, I really doubt it.

740
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:32,891
Rym: Yeah, it's it's a thing but though enough people are tagging GeekNights with the appropriate tags to make it come up very highly in The searches.

741
00:48:33,292 --> 00:48:33,714
Scott: that's good.

742
00:48:34,135 --> 00:48:35,760
Rym: And we've got three reviews written there.

743
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,121
Rym: Whoo.

744
00:48:36,603 --> 00:48:37,064
Scott: Oh really?

745
00:48:37,084 --> 00:48:38,047
Scott: I only read like one.

746
00:48:38,067 --> 00:48:41,049
Scott: Yeah All right, so.

747
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:44,841
Rym: But anyway to answer the question someone posted in the forums.

748
00:48:45,483 --> 00:48:47,549
Rym: Yeah, the 20 means we have 20 Yahoo!

749
00:48:47,589 --> 00:48:48,070
Rym: subscribers.

750
00:48:48,512 --> 00:48:50,319
Rym: It does not mean we have 20 subscribers.

751
00:48:50,399 --> 00:48:52,809
Rym: GeekNights has far more than 20 subscribers.

752
00:48:53,991 --> 00:48:55,375
Scott: Yeah, or else I wouldn't be here.

753
00:48:55,415 --> 00:48:55,736
Scott: Maybe.

754
00:48:56,057 --> 00:48:59,787
Rym: yeah, we're switching to Libsyn real soon for the mp3 hosting.

755
00:48:59,807 --> 00:49:00,630
Scott: good because we need to.

756
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:03,458
Rym: Yeah, cuz we're running out of space and bandwidth real quick.

757
00:49:03,959 --> 00:49:04,240
Scott: Yeah.

758
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:04,681
Scott: Uh-oh.

759
00:49:04,982 --> 00:49:12,944
Scott: Yeah, so if GeekNights goes down or something Don't start calling us on the phone and stuff because that means we'll be back shortly.

760
00:49:13,024 --> 00:49:14,810
Rym: We're working on all those issues.

761
00:49:15,292 --> 00:49:19,749
Scott: Yeah, hopefully we can just stay up, you know by the skin of our teeth until we have.

762
00:49:19,769 --> 00:49:21,637
Rym: yeah Cuz Libsyn's has had its own issues.

763
00:49:21,697 --> 00:49:24,650
Rym: Otherwise, I was actually gonna migrate two weeks ago, but they had some problems.

764
00:49:25,071 --> 00:49:26,156
Scott: Are they over their problems?

765
00:49:26,818 --> 00:49:27,400
