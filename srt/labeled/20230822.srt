1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,386
Rym: It's Tuesday, August 22nd, 2023.

2
00:00:10,386 --> 00:00:10,706
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:10,767 --> 00:00:12,892
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:20,116
Rym: tonight We are talking about the quake 2 remaster.

5
00:00:21,103 --> 00:00:24,150
Rym: Kind of just quick - Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,372
Rym: yeah, mr.

7
00:00:30,412 --> 00:00:40,059
Rym: Shows last week cuz I caught kovat for the second time and Yep, so it seems Moderately hard to avoid if you continue to live your life.

8
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,810
Rym: at this point though Scott has continued to still avoid it.

9
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,786
Scott: So hopefully I mean, I don't know that I've avoided it.

10
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:48,710
Scott: I just Don't know that I haven't avoided it, right?

11
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:53,550
Scott: That's why it's possible that I've had it with no symptoms and no positive test.

12
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,230
Rym: That's the hardest part because I didn't actually get that sick.

13
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:07,606
Rym: like I was being extra cautious because a lot of the evidence says that a big cause of long kovat is pushing yourself or like Exerting while you have kovat and I given yourself enough time to recover.

14
00:01:07,626 --> 00:01:12,158
Rym: so Precautionarily, I was super super careful.

15
00:01:12,178 --> 00:01:21,421
Rym: I was going to bed early like not working out like isolating but Before kovat if I had felt that sick I won.

16
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:24,210
Rym: I would have gone to work - I wouldn't have even thought I was sick.

17
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,630
Rym: I would have thought I was just tired and that would have been the end of it.

18
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,169
Rym: Like I would not have even thought of the possibility that I am sick.

19
00:01:30,852 --> 00:01:42,670
Rym: The only reason I even knew it was kovat is because Emily came home from Michigan where she definitely caught it like traveling around like at an airport in upstate, Michigan, but She came home and she's like I got a slight tickle in my throat.

20
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,109
Rym: I should take a kovat test and there was the faintest little line.

21
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:49,790
Scott: Well, yeah, I mean that a faintest line means you've got it.

22
00:01:51,534 --> 00:01:58,470
Scott: Every time I've done the test there has been Absolutely, no line whatsoever like not even a little bit of line.

23
00:01:59,113 --> 00:02:00,943
Scott: Any amount of line makes me think up.

24
00:02:00,983 --> 00:02:02,149
Scott: there must be some kovat in there.

25
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:12,730
Rym: But had Emily not felt a tickle in her throat and decided to take a test I literally would not have known and would not have changed anything Like I would have kept going to work and I would have nothing in my life would have changed.

26
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:14,858
Scott: So well good for the.

27
00:02:15,058 --> 00:02:17,568
Scott: you know, the little free home tests good a good thing.

28
00:02:17,588 --> 00:02:18,070
Scott: They exist.

29
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:21,262
Scott: Maybe we should have those for more things, right?

30
00:02:21,363 --> 00:02:22,830
Scott: Yeah, maybe we sure know would be cool.

31
00:02:23,091 --> 00:02:25,600
Scott: Why can't we you know, what if they made one?

32
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:28,010
Scott: I don't know if this would be possible, right?

33
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,146
Rym: Where you it tests for like five different com right?

34
00:02:32,206 --> 00:02:33,070
Scott: It's like the litter, right?

35
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:34,315
Scott: So you do the swabbing.

36
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:40,769
Scott: you put it in the liquid you squeeze it out and there's like a long Test strip that's got like seven lines on it.

37
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:46,230
Scott: It's like if you're sick you put it on and which line lights up tells you which sickness you have.

38
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,876
Scott: I am it's a pretty sure.

39
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:49,200
Scott: it's a kovat.

40
00:02:49,521 --> 00:02:56,142
Rym: only reason we can't have something like that Is the combination of capitalism and conservatism and it may be.

41
00:02:56,483 --> 00:02:58,690
Scott: I'm just wondering scientifically if that's not possible.

42
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,948
Scott: Like does the liquid part have to be different for each one?

43
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,330
Scott: Probably like it would be pointless because you'd have to swab and liquid five times.

44
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,950
Scott: So you'd be sitting there doing this like for an hour until you've figured out which one you've got.

45
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,800
Rym: I feel like the real important thing is just that.

46
00:03:11,881 --> 00:03:22,944
Rym: I hope the mindset at least in the Blue parts of the country has indeed become if you feel sick Don't go out like don't go to the party you were going to just like normalize.

47
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:24,849
Rym: if you feel sick stay home.

48
00:03:25,652 --> 00:03:26,455
Scott: Yeah, I mean that's good.

49
00:03:26,495 --> 00:03:27,218
Scott: No matter what does.

50
00:03:27,238 --> 00:03:29,225
Rym: yeah, that's something we people should I mean.

51
00:03:29,787 --> 00:03:30,650
Rym: even before kovat?

52
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:44,756
Rym: nothing annoyed me more than Being it like a pax and like getting into a line for something and then the person in front of you is like clearly like dying of the flu Like What are you doing buddy?

53
00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:44,957
Rym: like?

54
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:47,930
Scott: I know it's like that should be like a crime.

55
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:55,630
Scott: Yeah, like if you know that you are ill Right with it with a virus of ordinance some kind of it, right?

56
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,965
Scott: It's like obviously if you're ill with something else like you have cancer.

57
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:10,392
Scott: It's like yeah, you can go outside It's not the same right, but if you have some sort of viral Bacterial infection, you know MRSA something something nasty and contagious or could be contagious coffee sneezy Right.

58
00:04:10,412 --> 00:04:15,126
Scott: Yeah, you should be required to basically house arrest yourself.

59
00:04:15,327 --> 00:04:18,889
Scott: And if you don't Then you should get in trouble.

60
00:04:19,671 --> 00:04:20,778
Rym: Fever is a good line.

61
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:22,730
Rym: If you got a fever definitely don't go anywhere.

62
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:32,760
Scott: There's a reason why a lot of well unless you're going to the doctor or the hospital or the pharmacy or I don't know.

63
00:04:32,841 --> 00:04:39,350
Scott: It's What you know some another person in your family's home to take care of you, you know something reasonable, right?

64
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,904
Scott: But not any public place where there are.

65
00:04:41,924 --> 00:04:43,090
Rym: now there's one.

66
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:49,040
Rym: There's the capitalist problem of some people are forced to go to work or they'll starve no matter how sick they are And that's a big big problem.

67
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,450
Scott: We need to fix that heart, right?

68
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,990
Rym: Nobody needs to go to a PAX as an attendee if they've got a fever.

69
00:04:56,472 --> 00:04:58,483
Rym: I don't care how much you like packs.

70
00:04:59,166 --> 00:04:59,709
Scott: That's correct.

71
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,902
Rym: So, uh, yep, otherwise, so get right into it again.

72
00:05:03,922 --> 00:05:06,990
Scott: when I would hear a katsu con and I was sick I just stayed in the hotel room.

73
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:12,470
Rym: That what we did come out to do our like late show panel on stage.

74
00:05:12,591 --> 00:05:13,817
Rym: And what do we do after we finish it?

75
00:05:13,838 --> 00:05:15,004
Rym: We went straight back to the room.

76
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:17,677
Scott: That's right And I was far away from the people.

77
00:05:17,838 --> 00:05:18,099
Scott: Yep.

78
00:05:18,722 --> 00:05:20,570
Rym: I still can't believe we made it through that show.

79
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:27,543
Rym: That was that was like top 10 sickest I've ever felt Near the bottom of that list, but it's on that list.

80
00:05:27,563 --> 00:05:29,392
Scott: I Guess I was.

81
00:05:29,492 --> 00:05:30,878
Rym: number one is pretty poisoning.

82
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:32,484
Rym: Number two is Lyme disease.

83
00:05:32,544 --> 00:05:34,935
Rym: Number three is actually a sinus infection I got recently.

84
00:05:35,297 --> 00:05:37,349
Rym: Covid was like seven I think on that list.

85
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,761
Rym: Anyway tons of news.

86
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:41,910
Rym: we're gonna forget most of it.

87
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:45,289
Rym: These are just the three that stood out from when we decided to do a show today.

88
00:05:46,214 --> 00:05:54,933
Rym: but first and foremost I. I had Atari 2600 that was gifted to us by our good friend the cold guy that Had.

89
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:55,294
Scott: I had.

90
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:59,347
Scott: well I had one when I was young and my family has like five of them.

91
00:05:59,407 --> 00:06:02,216
Rym: like both Grandparents had an Atari 2600.

92
00:06:02,216 --> 00:06:04,284
Rym: We also had an Atari 2600 as did our aunt and uncles.

93
00:06:06,493 --> 00:06:08,106
Scott: You guys had a lot of money my family.

94
00:06:08,126 --> 00:06:16,250
Rym: No, we didn't Like my I come from and I cannot like I talk about this occasionally.

95
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,930
Rym: I know what I'm talking about my deep past that much on GeekNights.

96
00:06:19,654 --> 00:06:21,343
Rym: I come from a family of gamers.

97
00:06:21,383 --> 00:06:30,183
Rym: like gaming was Central to my entire extended family's lives video gaming games role-playing D&D just gaming.

98
00:06:30,203 --> 00:06:34,650
Scott: Yeah But you know, we didn't go spending money on shit.

99
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,332
Scott: We couldn't afford.

100
00:06:35,373 --> 00:06:39,588
Scott: but we had an Atari 2600 that was like collectively purchased but ended up in our home.

101
00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:47,327
Rym: Yeah Well, we partly we got more and more 2600s over time as they became of zero costs because they were.

102
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:59,050
Rym: we did not do that But I got a 7800 before I got an NES and they were out around the same time because the 7800 Cost an order of magnitude less than an NES back then it did not function very reliably.

103
00:06:59,251 --> 00:06:59,833
Scott: So it was not.

104
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:03,689
Scott: eventually just stopped being used because it's like it's was such a pain in the ass to try to.

105
00:07:04,171 --> 00:07:05,495
Rym: But I also had the same.

106
00:07:05,556 --> 00:07:06,017
Scott: I didn't know.

107
00:07:06,118 --> 00:07:09,328
Scott: but much better cuz what was I five was if I was my age?

108
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,294
Scott: Yeah, I could have done something about it.

109
00:07:11,816 --> 00:07:20,622
Rym: So, uh, I had of course a gigantic pile of Atari games like Nearly a hundred actual cartridges all functional times.

110
00:07:20,662 --> 00:07:21,365
Rym: We had games.

111
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:22,590
Scott: we had a handful.

112
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:32,870
Rym: Well because by the time I break out pac-man combat I don't know if we even had anything else besides that when I was a little kid We had like 20 or 30 total across the family and we'd pass him around.

113
00:07:32,972 --> 00:07:40,301
Rym: but as I get older like remember we'd go to we'd go to the gaming store and we were at RIT and Sometimes we I would just buy like an Atari game for 25 cents.

114
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:41,545
Rym: Like they were not expensive.

115
00:07:41,987 --> 00:07:50,123
Rym: That wasn't beacon I'm pretty sure because I had the Atari 2600 in the 7800 at RIT not the 2600.

116
00:07:50,123 --> 00:07:52,819
Scott: Where would you buy an Atari cartridge in there?

117
00:07:58,156 --> 00:07:58,782
Rym: The hippie mall.

118
00:07:58,802 --> 00:08:03,060
Scott: I Don't remember any place in there that had an Atari car.

119
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:04,970
Rym: I do but I can't be sure.

120
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,101
Scott: I remember I debt the Dragons didn't be in.

121
00:08:07,563 --> 00:08:08,869
Scott: pkipsy definitely had a few.

122
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:14,989
Rym: Yeah, they did but I know we were buying them before then because they the average Atari cartridge cost about a nickel even in the 90s.

123
00:08:16,471 --> 00:08:24,879
Rym: Anyway, so I just recently gave all of my Atari away and every Atari console every controller every game everything.

124
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:25,747
Rym: I gave them all away.

125
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:38,418
Rym: and Now there is a brand new Atari 7800 in a Atari 2600 case that is full-featured and has HDMI and USB-c and just works.

126
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:44,126
Rym: that was released by Atari Officially legit that I could have used for all those games for 130 bucks.

127
00:08:45,572 --> 00:08:46,073
Scott: Yeah, I mean.

128
00:08:46,113 --> 00:09:02,450
Scott: so what's happening is there are plenty of people out there who you can buy consoles from that are not official in any way shape or form But will play cartridges for all kinds of other, you know, and they're totally legal the vast majority of them, right?

129
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,030
Scott: It's like, you know, you can't get a top loading NES.

130
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:09,590
Scott: You can just buy this other thing that plays NES cartridges perfectly.

131
00:09:10,912 --> 00:09:21,002
Scott: it's not an NES, but it might as well be and They're out there, right, but this is the first time You know that I've seen a company come out and say, all right.

132
00:09:21,042 --> 00:09:22,928
Scott: Well, we'll just make one of those but official.

133
00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:34,087
Scott: Yep And I mean you've had the NES mini the Genesis mini the PlayStation mini But those are just like, you know little computers with some memory and a bunch of ROMs installed.

134
00:09:34,168 --> 00:09:34,910
Scott: right an emulator.

135
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:44,970
Rym: This is play the old cartridges Which is totally a difference the equivalent of buying a modern record player turntable or a modern VHS tape player.

136
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:46,693
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

137
00:09:46,773 --> 00:09:52,350
Scott: I don't know why Nintendo doesn't you know, could they make money if they just made some super Nintendo's?

138
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,842
Rym: You know what I would do if I were Nintendo.

139
00:09:55,184 --> 00:10:04,890
Rym: I'd make those brand them as a special edition limited run and charge an insane amount of money for them and If a critical mass of people would definitely buy them.

140
00:10:05,091 --> 00:10:10,390
Scott: It's like you can already buy one of those effectively maybe even better than the official one for cheap.

141
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,599
Scott: But it's like yeah an official Nintendo one might go for more.

142
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:35,260
Rym: Also, if I were Nintendo, I Would invest in making the re-released NES and SNES consoles start with those two Effectively As legitimate as on the original consoles could be.

143
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,530
Rym: that would be a huge not only a huge selling point.

144
00:10:38,852 --> 00:10:41,110
Rym: That would actually I think be important to video game preservation.

145
00:10:42,031 --> 00:10:46,388
Scott: I think it would also be you know, the portable consoles would be better right because it's like you could.

146
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:49,298
Scott: you know Right now like I'm upgrading GBAs, right?

147
00:10:49,378 --> 00:11:00,650
Scott: Yeah, they could just sell official, you know GBAs that are upgraded and but they could probably do much better than Anyone in the upgrading modding scene does.

148
00:11:02,091 --> 00:11:04,880
Rym: Plus I can emulate a game and they could get the real.

149
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,494
Scott: they get the real buttons and not like these crappier buttons that I'm Getting.

150
00:11:08,595 --> 00:11:18,330
Rym: yeah, but also I can emulate a Gameboy But I don't really want to sit at my computer or my TV playing an og Gameboy game Like I want to play that on the go.

151
00:11:20,473 --> 00:11:23,545
Scott: Anyway, so it's a new Atari did it and maybe some other people will follow suit.

152
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:31,722
Rym: Yeah, I think it's really cool And also they they confirmed it is fully compatible with the original 267800 controllers as well.

153
00:11:31,742 --> 00:11:42,366
Rym: like it is legit It's exactly the same thing effectively speaking Yep, just whereas the you even has the old ports on the back in addition to the HDMI USB C.

154
00:11:43,008 --> 00:11:43,429
Scott: Oh does it?

155
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:50,950
Rym: Yeah So cool, if I hadn't literally just given away every Atari game I owned I would definitely have bought one of these.

156
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:56,950
Rym: But since I gave it away I'm sticking to my policy of trying to keep less fewer atoms in my house.

157
00:11:57,815 --> 00:11:59,829
Scott: Yeah, that's right fewer baryons.

158
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,819
Rym: So in some other news Surprised it didn't happen sooner.

159
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:07,690
Rym: Anyone who's mad about this I mean, come on dudes awesome.

160
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,341
Rym: But he should also have the ability to retire and move on to a new role.

161
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:29,168
Rym: Charles Martinette the voice of Mario is No longer going to be playing Mario and is moving on to being the Mario ambassador which sounds like The perfect best possible retirement job for someone like that.

162
00:12:29,229 --> 00:12:32,450
Scott: I could imagine Yeah, I mean, this is what a lot of athletes do right?

163
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:45,363
Scott: It's like they retire and then their team like if especially an athlete that was with one team the whole time or a majority Of the time will get some sort of you know job with the team Like they get paid some nominal amount.

164
00:12:45,423 --> 00:12:48,275
Rym: They got a tanner glass or a gurney They had.

165
00:12:48,315 --> 00:12:55,776
Scott: well tanner glass is an actual job but like You know, it's like but they'll you know, just had to appear at some functions right?

166
00:12:55,796 --> 00:12:59,818
Scott: some fundraisers Some promotional events, right?

167
00:12:59,898 --> 00:13:01,563
Scott: They don't really shake hands.

168
00:13:01,603 --> 00:13:03,910
Scott: do some signings do some outreach.

169
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:10,577
Scott: you know really, you know, you really like to do like hard office work or 40 day a week work or anything like that.

170
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:11,961
Scott: You just sort of you're.

171
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:13,044
Scott: you're getting paid.

172
00:13:13,064 --> 00:13:14,930
Scott: You're holding on to you.

173
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:22,610
Scott: We're maintaining our good relationship with you, but you don't need to actually do your actual job anymore because the time has come.

174
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:36,044
Rym: now what'll be interesting is They Nintendo's already confirmed that the new Super Mario Brothers wonder and onward will not involve Charles Martinet And these games definitely have Mario voices.

175
00:13:36,346 --> 00:13:36,869
Rym: I've heard them.

176
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:43,270
Rym: So the question is going to be is Nintendo going to announce the name of the new person?

177
00:13:43,993 --> 00:13:45,580
Scott: Are they going to be in the credits right?

178
00:13:45,761 --> 00:13:47,810
Rym: will they or will they keep it secret?

179
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,610
Scott: I don't can't not put it in the credits.

180
00:13:50,657 --> 00:14:03,574
Rym: If it's if it's a person, uh So the old video games a lot of people who don't get credited despite doing for real work Video games voice act in a video game then, you know You're a lot a lot a lot A lot of people don't?

181
00:14:03,614 --> 00:14:06,504
Rym: they sign bad contracts because the work doesn't pay much.

182
00:14:06,865 --> 00:14:07,829
Scott: show me a Nintendo game.

183
00:14:07,869 --> 00:14:09,557
Scott: That doesn't I don't think.

184
00:14:09,577 --> 00:14:11,366
Rym: does that other companies definitely do?

185
00:14:11,427 --> 00:14:15,808
Rym: I'm just saying What I'm surprised what I would have expected.

186
00:14:15,828 --> 00:14:25,550
Rym: I would bet that the voice of Mario will be a Machine learning generated at some point in the future and remain that way in perpetuity.

187
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:38,683
Scott: Well, I mean you could do a whole 10 GeekNights episodes about you know, AI replacing, you know actors but Type of voice like they're basically sound effects in a video game.

188
00:14:38,904 --> 00:14:40,550
Rym: That's the lowest hanging fruit.

189
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:42,470
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty low hanging.

190
00:14:43,974 --> 00:14:54,390
Rym: So on some final news because we were dunking on this a little while ago and Scott has Admitted that you've got a what a twitch stream open in the background while we're doing GeekNights muted that you're not watching?

191
00:14:55,092 --> 00:14:55,554
Scott: Yeah, why not?

192
00:14:55,674 --> 00:15:05,263
Rym: Yeah, so anything there is one of all the of all the many toxic influences of capitalism and games one that just annoys me personally.

193
00:15:05,744 --> 00:15:12,210
Rym: and there's a lot going on and we're not gonna have time to get Into all the factors about this especially because we'll repeat ourselves from previous episodes quite a bit.

194
00:15:12,732 --> 00:15:32,030
Rym: but I've always particularly disgusted and annoyed by Companies, especially twitch like twitch is all over this and has been for a long time Trying to give people direct rewards like drops or loot basically paying people to watch Twitch streams to drive up viewership.

195
00:15:32,991 --> 00:15:43,689
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know think about the whole thing is all about, you know There's the we People right users customers audience, right?

196
00:15:44,491 --> 00:15:47,663
Scott: We are perfect world would be we can see what.

197
00:15:47,884 --> 00:15:49,069
Scott: whatever would we want to see?

198
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,713
Scott: Right and nothing.

199
00:15:50,753 --> 00:15:55,350
Scott: we don't want to see whenever we want to see it, right and no one tells us what to see.

200
00:15:56,092 --> 00:16:00,209
Scott: and the people who make things to see their perfect world is.

201
00:16:00,892 --> 00:16:05,569
Scott: We decide what you see when you see it how much you see it who sees it?

202
00:16:06,392 --> 00:16:10,467
Scott: And nobody gets to choose what they see when they see and this is the battle right.

203
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:19,512
Scott: and so The people on the producing side, you know, it's like they're basically in a war with each other as well for attention Right.

204
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:27,180
Scott: It's like I'm sitting here with two eyeballs and there's ten people who all want me to see their thing to the exclusion of The nine other things right.

205
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:31,381
Scott: so anything that they can do To get me to watch their thing instead.

206
00:16:31,402 --> 00:16:33,310
Scott: They're gonna do it, right?

207
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:39,950
Scott: So, you know there have been throughout history right people so many every iteration on this right.

208
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:48,770
Rym: There are sweepstakes where they would announce Numbers or pieces or a phone number to call at some point in the last third of the broadcast.

209
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:49,817
Rym: Make sure you don't miss it.

210
00:16:50,058 --> 00:16:54,409
Rym: It's only gonna be on the screen for ten seconds Probably in the middle of like five minutes of ads.

211
00:16:55,212 --> 00:16:58,342
Scott: Yeah, every single trick in the book has already been done.

212
00:16:58,422 --> 00:16:59,727
Scott: We'll pay you to watch the ads.

213
00:16:59,807 --> 00:17:00,649
Scott: Please watch them.

214
00:17:01,991 --> 00:17:07,448
Scott: You know you the content itself is so good right theoretically and then we just put ads on.

215
00:17:07,488 --> 00:17:08,089
Scott: you have to deal.

216
00:17:08,392 --> 00:17:08,713
Rym: You know what?

217
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:09,780
Rym: That is basic.

218
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,625
Scott: That's the basic.

219
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:11,530
Rym: That's NHL hockey.

220
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:20,015
Rym: Like I I still watch hockey despite the fact that there are physical ads on the ice that I can't not see Sure, it's like that's.

221
00:17:20,194 --> 00:17:21,960
Scott: that's the you know, the tried and true method.

222
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,584
Scott: Yeah, you know, they're the.

223
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:25,630
Scott: they're taking this to the next level here.

224
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,878
Scott: So this is Rym's first inner.

225
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:29,264
Scott: I think this is just the first time.

226
00:17:29,284 --> 00:17:32,665
Scott: you know, this is an old Talked about this on GeekNights before.

227
00:17:33,028 --> 00:17:37,189
Scott: yeah But this is the first time like it's hit a game that Rym was playing while he was playing it.

228
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,402
Scott: So Marvel snap had its piece.

229
00:17:39,502 --> 00:17:40,850
Scott: games comm is starting in Europe.

230
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,866
Scott: So there's a bunch of gaming news, but we don't care about most of that triple-a nonsense here.

231
00:17:44,887 --> 00:17:45,630
Scott: geek guys, you know that.

232
00:17:46,194 --> 00:17:58,930
Scott: But Marvel snap, which we still play Has is doing if their PC game, which is the only one I've ever really used mostly I only use the mobile one a little bit, but it's finally out of early access as of today.

233
00:17:59,031 --> 00:18:02,877
Scott: they upgraded it a whole bunch and they have.

234
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:14,550
Scott: they're doing a big promotional thing for that release and The promotion includes twitch drops and the way that works is you have to connect your twitch account and your snap account together.

235
00:18:14,831 --> 00:18:19,726
Scott: So now twitch note might get some data from snap and vice versa, right?

236
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:20,850
Scott: Who knows what kind of data?

237
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,819
Scott: They're sharing and have to read the privacy agreement.

238
00:18:23,261 --> 00:18:30,930
Scott: But also when you watch Snap on twitch for a certain amount of time on certain streams, right?

239
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:34,390
Scott: For example, there's one person over here who is being lit there.

240
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,340
Scott: They're open about it that they're being sponsored by snap.

241
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:47,510
Scott: So snap is paying this person to stream snap And if I watch them long enough with my connected accounts, I'll eventually get snap currencies.

242
00:18:48,315 --> 00:19:01,420
Scott: So I'm just minimized and muted them And it's like alright, I will just spend some CPU cycles and get some free snap credits Right eventually and that person I'm watching they'll benefit.

243
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:08,630
Rym: I guess well, cuz they'll get a fake eyeball watching 30.1 minutes of their stream, right?

244
00:19:09,571 --> 00:19:12,007
Scott: But yeah, this is the fun, you know, I'm still waiting for the.

245
00:19:12,248 --> 00:19:14,014
Scott: you know The final straw to break.

246
00:19:14,074 --> 00:19:18,987
Scott: with regards to you know advertising people love their numbers to be fake.

247
00:19:19,328 --> 00:19:20,452
Scott: so much Right.

248
00:19:20,853 --> 00:19:21,817
Scott: It's like they don't.

249
00:19:21,857 --> 00:19:28,790
Scott: they don't want to report the real numbers of things like the number of people actually Watching for real and paying attention is so small.

250
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,308
Scott: Like if those numbers got out the ad buyers would be like hell.

251
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:33,092
Scott: no Why am I?

252
00:19:33,112 --> 00:19:35,740
Scott: I'm not paying you nearly as much or as often.

253
00:19:35,761 --> 00:19:43,110
Rym: so I paid you to have 10,000 people Not watch this stream for a half hour and then log out the millisecond.

254
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:45,798
Rym: We gave them some pings in an app, right?

255
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:50,272
Scott: And then but on the other hand, they've got this competing thing Where it's like.

256
00:19:50,513 --> 00:19:53,183
Scott: we need to root out fraud and fake number.

257
00:19:53,203 --> 00:19:53,564
Rym: We need to.

258
00:19:53,585 --> 00:20:01,410
Rym: we need to Performatively show that we have put a nominal effort into rooting out fraud, right?

259
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:12,099
Scott: So this is the this this battle that's always happening between get the real numbers Or get fake numbers that are inflated But not too fake that no one will believe them.

260
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:15,953
Scott: and you can see the extreme end of this by looking at what's going on Right now.

261
00:20:15,973 --> 00:20:20,370
Scott: we're like, you know, Ellen has got like, you know, mostly bots following him.

262
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:30,770
Scott: It's like he doesn't want the real follower account to get out but other interested parties Want to know the number of real users not get all these bots out of here.

263
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:38,182
Rym: So it's funny because overwatch League tried to do something similar and from all the articles Like I just I talk about overwatch a lot because I play it a lot still.

264
00:20:38,202 --> 00:20:39,830
Rym: so I didn't want this just never made the cut.

265
00:20:40,851 --> 00:20:43,919
Rym: Their problem was people who didn't even like.

266
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:56,004
Rym: even the drops weren't enough to get people to watch the league matches on Twitch Like people just didn't even go for them didn't even bother with them That they have to be something that people are willing.

267
00:20:56,124 --> 00:21:00,538
Rym: and there's one thing that people want They want spider-man pictures of spider-man.

268
00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:03,225
Rym: literal textures of spider-man is what you get.

269
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:03,666
Scott: who doesn't?

270
00:21:04,007 --> 00:21:04,950
Scott: who doesn't want a picture?

271
00:21:06,123 --> 00:21:09,118
Rym: Oh They must hire JJJ as a consultant here.

272
00:21:09,138 --> 00:21:12,790
Scott: I mean listen, you know, JJJ wants pictures of spider-man.

273
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,353
Scott: But guess what?

274
00:21:13,393 --> 00:21:16,730
Scott: He wants them because if he puts them on the newspaper, everyone buys the newspaper.

275
00:21:16,993 --> 00:21:18,408
Scott: They want to see pictures of spider-man.

276
00:21:19,952 --> 00:21:21,546
Scott: He pays because he'll know you'll pay.

277
00:21:21,788 --> 00:21:23,717
Rym: Yep And now we're cutting out the middleman.

278
00:21:23,757 --> 00:21:28,402
Scott: if you if you let me tell you if the real if the real newspaper Had pictures of spider-man on it.

279
00:21:28,765 --> 00:21:29,228
Scott: I bought it.

280
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:38,342
Rym: Yeah, the first though for at least the first newspaper that had a real spider-man on it New York Times cover was like, you know had spider-man I'd be like.

281
00:21:38,362 --> 00:21:48,605
Rym: well get that thing is, you know humans Two weeks after the existence of a real spider-man Like was acknowledged it would just be in the background.

282
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:49,670
Rym: We wouldn't even think about it again.

283
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,162
Rym: It's like oh if spider-man did something interesting.

284
00:21:52,182 --> 00:21:52,322
Rym: Yeah.

285
00:21:52,503 --> 00:22:05,098
Scott: Anyway cookies out on the balcony Spider-sense but anyway things of the day.

286
00:22:05,118 --> 00:22:14,185
Rym: so So a listener and a friend both sent this to me after I had already queued it up as my thing of the day and The thing of the day is very short.

287
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:21,700
Rym: It's a two minute 30 second video that will walk you through a legitimately plausible chess opening.

288
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:35,074
Rym: But it is in the style and framed not the way chess people Traditionally frame these kinds of conversations but more the way Modern gamers frame these kinds of conversations.

289
00:22:35,135 --> 00:22:38,410
Rym: because if you haven't paid attention There's the like weed.

290
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:47,466
Rym: when we talk about chess on GeekNights We tend to talk about the top top tier and the drama around that and how everything's a draw and AI is messing stuff up and like the stalemate.

291
00:22:47,486 --> 00:22:50,398
Rym: rules need to change and there's all that sort of space.

292
00:22:50,759 --> 00:23:02,543
Rym: but If you talk about counter-strike that way that's the equivalent of yes It's the it's the counter-strike Intergalactic championship for the game is literally just who clicks on whose heads first around the corners and everything's memorable I like it's.

293
00:23:02,623 --> 00:23:05,779
Rym: it's a totally different game from how the vast majority of people play it.

294
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:22,039
Rym: So all the people who aren't grandmasters at chess who play chess for fun and have not Exhausted the possibilities of chess where chess is a really fun game that community is growing Rapidly and has been growing for many years now.

295
00:23:23,461 --> 00:23:25,325
Scott: Still hot still hot.

296
00:23:25,907 --> 00:23:37,780
Rym: So now there's lots of YouTube channels and streamers and people who are playing chess who are not the Stereotypical very old white man who seems gruff like it's just gamers talking about this like gamers.

297
00:23:38,142 --> 00:23:54,793
Rym: So this this video will walk you through something that is Actually kind of close to the opening I used to always play when I learned that openings existed in chess and that was how I beat my friends because if you play chess with an opening you will beat like 70% of people who don't know what an opening is.

298
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:58,788
Scott: even if you're bad at chess I've never bothered to memorize any kind of.

299
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:04,207
Rym: I've memorized the Polish opening and a variant on this one and Like a couple others.

300
00:24:04,227 --> 00:24:06,199
Rym: I don't do I remember them fully?

301
00:24:07,323 --> 00:24:08,010
Rym: Yes, I think I do.

302
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:31,190
Rym: Anyway, this Opening gambit is titled the intercontinental Ballistic missile gambit and it basically involves making a few moves because unless your opponent is like Kasparov They're not gonna see it coming like unless they know chess and then you basically launch your queen it into their back line Like a flanker in overwatch and fuck them up.

303
00:24:32,661 --> 00:24:35,311
Rym: And it's really funny as an opening to a chess person.

304
00:24:35,331 --> 00:24:42,951
Scott: The thing is if you're playing against some amateur They're gonna make moves that are way outside what this video Thinks they'll make and I don't know if it'll work.

305
00:24:43,213 --> 00:24:47,424
Rym: if they make moves outside of that though It's almost easier to pull this stuff off Maybe.

306
00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:56,602
Rym: but what I like about this video too is It actually does assume that you're gonna play basically competent chess and it just points out the few Dangers.

307
00:24:56,642 --> 00:24:57,545
Rym: that wouldn't be obvious.

308
00:24:57,666 --> 00:25:02,888
Rym: and it points out this one specific danger of if the if the opponent does this Don't be a fool.

309
00:25:02,928 --> 00:25:04,197
Rym: Don't take the bishop and you know what?

310
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,450
Rym: Well, I immediately before they said don't do this.

311
00:25:08,852 --> 00:25:11,340
Rym: I saw the move and I thought oh, I'll take the bishop and they're like.

312
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,370
Rym: No, don't you're a fool.

313
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:19,080
Rym: I Taken that bishop so hard and so fast in that situation.

314
00:25:20,123 --> 00:25:21,154
Rym: So yeah, that's what I got.

315
00:25:21,376 --> 00:25:21,760
Rym: play chess.

316
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,297
Rym: It's actually a pretty okay game unless you're really good at it or really bad at it or anyone's memorized anything.

317
00:25:27,438 --> 00:25:31,087
Scott: Yeah All right, so this videos.

318
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:34,760
Scott: maybe this video is quite old, but it was uploaded to YouTube quite a while ago.

319
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:41,279
Scott: But I only saw it during the Tour de France, which is already a while ago But didn't have until now to make a thing of the day.

320
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:45,780
Scott: But basically, you know when you look at the Tour de France our marathon or something.

321
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:56,113
Scott: It's like there's official people who are like, you know on teams driving support vehicles Supplying food beverages snacks equipment support etc.

322
00:25:56,153 --> 00:25:56,554
Scott: Right?

323
00:25:57,096 --> 00:26:04,440
Scott: Well back in the olden days Apparently that was not always the case And here we see a perfect example of it.

324
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:28,000
Scott: I didn't realize it was this extreme until I saw this video But apparently back in the olden days for these long bike races the people would just sort of the Cyclists, which is sort of when they were hungry or thirsty and there was a cafe They would just get off and loot the cafe like they would run in steel Shoplift put shit in there in their pockets.

325
00:26:28,281 --> 00:26:33,076
Rym: They're like walking around like cramming food into their mouths putting like bottles of wine in the back of their Jersey.

326
00:26:33,117 --> 00:26:35,925
Scott: Yeah It's like what it's like.

327
00:26:36,466 --> 00:26:41,099
Scott: and then basically the people with the cafes would send you know an invoice to the to the tour.

328
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,060
Scott: be Like hey, this is what you guys shoplifted.

329
00:26:44,882 --> 00:26:47,494
Rym: It was a culturally cherished tradition.

330
00:26:47,635 --> 00:26:51,592
Scott: from watching this video I don't know how cherished it was by the cafe owner, but I get.

331
00:26:51,612 --> 00:26:52,395
Scott: I assume they got.

332
00:26:52,596 --> 00:26:56,623
Scott: the invoice was paid But still it's like, you know It's.

333
00:26:56,663 --> 00:27:03,951
Scott: it's pretty funny to see just somebody get off and loot a cafe Like it's like it's like they're supposed to but especially the videos like.

334
00:27:04,232 --> 00:27:09,759
Rym: one of the most important moments of the tour are the drinking Raids and I made it like what the fuck is the drinking raid?

335
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,408
Rym: Yeah you know, it's funny because

336
00:27:13,448 --> 00:27:13,950
Scott: one idea

337
00:27:14,111 --> 00:27:30,677
Rym: what it starts to illustrate is a thing that we talked about occasionally where and actually we talked about a little while ago where the extreme optimization of any game any sport like any system tends to become Very different from the thing it was intended to be.

338
00:27:30,717 --> 00:27:34,560
Rym: up to that point Like baseball has the very small number of true outcomes.

339
00:27:34,902 --> 00:27:40,731
Rym: The number might increase or reduce slightly based on the rules But most of the parts of baseball don't matter anymore.

340
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:49,319
Rym: And as people professionalize also, a lot of fun aspects of sports and fun aspects of games become less and less prominent.

341
00:27:49,339 --> 00:28:02,022
Rym: and think about what this looks like if you watch this video of like the way the racing was like they're like Eating ice cream sandwiches and like popsicles while they're riding they got bottles of wine And these are.

342
00:28:02,304 --> 00:28:04,619
Rym: these are the pros racing in the for real tour.

343
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:05,709
Rym: nowadays.

344
00:28:05,729 --> 00:28:18,300
Rym: it is Extremely scientifically driven riders with an infinite line of cars giving them Highly tuned food that they can and highly food that tuned beverages that they consume on a very strict schedule.

345
00:28:18,582 --> 00:28:22,704
Rym: It's like he almost took most of this fun out of it But you made it.

346
00:28:22,845 --> 00:28:24,934
Scott: that could be fun from a certain perspective.

347
00:28:25,035 --> 00:28:25,457
Scott: It can.

348
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:32,964
Rym: yeah, I Feel like I would enjoy the older Tour de France more than the current one But we should.

349
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,993
Scott: we should hold it, you know old Tour de France, right?

350
00:28:36,013 --> 00:28:36,856
Scott: No one's allowed.

351
00:28:37,137 --> 00:28:39,505
Scott: no support cars allowed No support vehicles.

352
00:28:40,047 --> 00:28:41,351
Rym: We stock cafe.

353
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:41,974
Rym: You have to.

354
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:43,680
Scott: you can only eat and drink if you loot.

355
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:46,535
Scott: You didn't loot it.

356
00:28:46,575 --> 00:28:47,239
Scott: you can't drink it.

357
00:28:49,662 --> 00:28:53,936
Rym: In the meta moment the GeekNights book club book is the murder bot diaries.

358
00:28:54,498 --> 00:28:55,120
Rym: I picked this one.

359
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:57,167
Rym: We're good at what we're gonna do.

360
00:28:57,187 --> 00:28:59,640
Rym: I have read 1.5 of the murder bot diary.

361
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,797
Scott: I have read 3.9 murder effectively for murder bot diaries.

362
00:29:03,957 --> 00:29:07,809
Scott: so far Each of them has taken literally one sitting.

363
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:08,551
Scott: the first one.

364
00:29:08,571 --> 00:29:10,216
Scott: I finished eating dinner.

365
00:29:10,236 --> 00:29:11,680
Scott: I went to the park.

366
00:29:12,023 --> 00:29:17,560
Scott: I laid down on the bench in the park I started reading and then I finished reading and the Sun went down and I went home.

367
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,651
Scott: That's how long one book takes like two to three hours.

368
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:22,317
Rym: Yeah, we went to Queensbridge Park.

369
00:29:22,337 --> 00:29:23,040
Scott: I went to the beach.

370
00:29:23,201 --> 00:29:25,234
Scott: I read 1.9 books at the beach.

371
00:29:25,254 --> 00:29:28,920
Rym: Yeah Yep, so these are pretty quick read.

372
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:32,193
Rym: So what we're gonna do is we're just gonna keep reading them and see how far we get.

373
00:29:32,213 --> 00:29:34,225
Rym: cuz there's a bunch of murder bot Diaries.

374
00:29:34,266 --> 00:29:36,565
Rym: we're reading them in Publication order.

375
00:29:36,746 --> 00:29:38,895
Rym: cuz why not doesn't really matter the order.

376
00:29:38,915 --> 00:29:39,980
Scott: the internet says to read them in.

377
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,871
Scott: Yeah, I don't have numbers on them, which is annoying.

378
00:29:41,891 --> 00:29:43,500
Scott: I had to look up what the order is based.

379
00:29:43,641 --> 00:29:53,660
Scott: Yeah, I went to Martha Wells website which had a handy list in order And that's what you do have to read them in order Like they literally that they pick up right where the previous one left off like immediately.

380
00:29:53,761 --> 00:29:56,000
Scott: There is no gap and it's cereal.

381
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,751
Scott: so yes, you figure out the order even if the volumes don't have numbers.

382
00:30:00,392 --> 00:30:23,380
Rym: and what I'll say so far is that the Deepest vibe is think about the alien aliens universe the kind of capitalism the kinds of companies the kinds of situations and it's that world as seen through the eyes of a Low rent security bot who doesn't want to do its job.

383
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:26,427
Scott: Yeah, the security bot is like I thought it was.

384
00:30:26,447 --> 00:30:35,934
Scott: it said murder bot Diaries and I was expecting when Rym explained it originally That it was gonna be like an assassin right like all it like some military.

385
00:30:36,095 --> 00:30:36,777
Scott: It's like man.

386
00:30:36,857 --> 00:30:38,000
Rym: I wish I was an assassin.

387
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,726
Rym: I'm just like a rent a cop.

388
00:30:40,027 --> 00:30:41,973
Scott: right like all it does is kill right.

389
00:30:42,013 --> 00:30:44,903
Scott: so then it has to contend with like you know All these issues.

390
00:30:44,923 --> 00:30:47,956
Scott: like my only only thing I know how to do is kill these clients.

391
00:30:48,117 --> 00:30:48,900
Scott: right, but it's not.

392
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:51,844
Scott: It's a security bot You know which is like.

393
00:30:52,386 --> 00:31:05,337
Scott: you know its its purpose was to protect people although it has many capabilities for violence And that sort of on the one hand brings it in right to make more sense, but on the other hand loses some of that.

394
00:31:06,102 --> 00:31:08,152
Rym: Anyway, yep, but so far.

395
00:31:08,192 --> 00:31:08,734
Rym: I'm enjoying it.

396
00:31:08,815 --> 00:31:13,280
Rym: so at some point after packs We'll do the book club show on it, and we'll warn you how far we get.

397
00:31:13,682 --> 00:31:17,159
Rym: I'm probably gonna read them all regardless, but we'll see if I read them all before we do the show.

398
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:20,338
Rym: But with two flights to Seattle I feel like I might just read them all.

399
00:31:21,284 --> 00:31:23,335
Scott: How many how many of you read listener?

400
00:31:23,516 --> 00:31:23,979
Scott: Where are you?

401
00:31:24,861 --> 00:31:31,939
Rym: Considering I just put up the post now So the only listener who knew we were talking doing this book was someone who listened to the previous book club book on.

402
00:31:31,979 --> 00:31:33,146
Rym: this is How you lose the time war.

403
00:31:33,468 --> 00:31:41,919
Rym: the GeekNights book club has done Actually a lot of books over the years not because we do them quickly But because GeekNights has been going has a lot of years.

404
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,174
Rym: 2005 was a long goddamn time ago.

405
00:31:47,837 --> 00:31:48,300
Scott: That's right.

406
00:31:49,481 --> 00:31:54,453
Rym: Also, we will be live at PAX West 2023 with an all-new panel.

407
00:31:54,794 --> 00:32:01,120
Rym: and well sometimes if we have a panel That's a variation on a previous theme Scott will call me out and say it's not at all new panel.

408
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,485
Rym: It's like 20% new.

409
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:06,160
Rym: this one actually is an entirely new talk.

410
00:32:06,682 --> 00:32:14,591
Rym: the problem is we already came up with an even better talk that we want to do after this one, but Games you can't play Sunday 3 30 p.m.

411
00:32:14,651 --> 00:32:16,436
Rym: Eastern time not Eastern time.

412
00:32:16,456 --> 00:32:18,040
Rym: I just that's a typo.

413
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,682
Rym: I got a fix.

414
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:24,705
Rym: soon as we finish the show a Seattle time in the blue morpho theater I guess.

415
00:32:24,845 --> 00:32:38,320
Rym: I guess will it be what the daily savings won't be over yet, so it'll be PDT Yeah or just PT and that way that whether or not daylight saving time is applied is Implied and doesn't need to be explicitly stated thus avoiding confusion.

416
00:32:40,703 --> 00:32:47,929
Rym: I also was reminded again recently because I was trying to set up a meeting across a bunch of time zones And I knew this, but I forgot that I knew it.

417
00:32:47,949 --> 00:32:55,747
Rym: I learned it again that China is one big time zone What I didn't know that.

418
00:32:56,108 --> 00:32:58,073
Rym: oh, I feel like we talked about this.

419
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:01,160
Scott: we should go to the far western China.

420
00:33:01,722 --> 00:33:02,444
Rym: So you know that's.

421
00:33:02,585 --> 00:33:09,599
Scott: uh cuz Emily was in Michigan and while she was gone we talked about that all right But about far western China is gonna be.

422
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:10,603
Scott: wait Yeah, cuz think about that.

423
00:33:10,663 --> 00:33:16,340
Rym: where Emily was is like a eight to twelve hour drive from here.

424
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:19,393
Rym: How far could you drive across China at eight to twelve hours?

425
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:38,007
Scott: I don't know measured I Imagine not all the way All right, so uh Weirdly we have never talked about quake quake one quake to the only talks about quake live Yep, talked about death matches.

426
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:42,881
Scott: We've talked about these things, but we never did an episode directly on Quake.

427
00:33:43,262 --> 00:33:49,900
Rym: one two three yep, so this episode at least will be about the quake to remaster that just came out.

428
00:33:50,343 --> 00:33:57,216
Rym: but it is by extension a Review our discussion of just quake - because it is it's the same damn game.

429
00:33:57,276 --> 00:33:58,140
Rym: It's just a patch.

430
00:33:58,582 --> 00:34:02,960
Rym: It's like if what if Super Mario 1 got an official patch from Nintendo today?

431
00:34:03,682 --> 00:34:06,472
Scott: We talked about that in the news when the quake one remaster came out.

432
00:34:06,492 --> 00:34:09,321
Scott: right and this is this is what I'm talking about Right.

433
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,569
Scott: so many other companies for example Capcom.

434
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:31,478
Scott: They do these Resident Evil remasters right which I'm played some of them Yeah, and it's like yes those original games are have much much merit and are worth playing for certain reasons But they're software implementations the user interfaces not ideal right it's inaccessible annoying ugly.

435
00:34:32,141 --> 00:34:34,666
Scott: Dated Control is bad right.

436
00:34:34,967 --> 00:34:44,254
Rym: people put up with it back then, but now by modern standards not pleasant But also those those tend to be when they remit when they remaster them re-implemented.

437
00:34:45,342 --> 00:34:52,417
Scott: Yeah, sometimes sometimes the Resident Evil ones are basically the same damn game And it's like and then they charge money for it.

438
00:34:53,001 --> 00:35:01,120
Scott: Right because it's like they put a lot to put a lot of work into that because they basically rebuilt a new game that just Happens to be the same as some other game, right?

439
00:35:01,762 --> 00:35:15,460
Scott: it's like you know and So there's that kind of remake that happens, then you've got like Nintendo Which does like sort of like a HD remaster which almost feels like they didn't put too much work into it.

440
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:29,670
Scott: not like the Resident Evil ones where it's just like they're basically just taking like a Wii game or a GameCube game and making it HD and Recompiling it and just getting it to run on a switch and upping the resolution And it's still the same damn game basically

441
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:29,891
Rym: of course.

442
00:35:29,931 --> 00:35:34,309
Rym: then they have things like the Link's Awakening remaster Which was like that was a work of art.

443
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:34,610
Scott: Yeah.

444
00:35:34,992 --> 00:35:37,060
Scott: Yeah, that's a. that's a complete redo, right?

445
00:35:37,881 --> 00:35:39,969
Scott: So here what the what they've been doing?

446
00:35:39,989 --> 00:35:42,338
Scott: down, I guess but the company is Bethesda.

447
00:35:42,379 --> 00:35:46,295
Scott: now Right is with Quake 1. they're just like on Steam.

448
00:35:46,696 --> 00:35:48,882
Scott: if you got Quake 1 We're right.

449
00:35:48,902 --> 00:35:50,887
Scott: there already been fans doing this.

450
00:35:50,988 --> 00:35:55,400
Scott: fans have made like custom engines that you know will run.

451
00:35:55,962 --> 00:36:03,365
Scott: You know your doom or your quake or your tie fighter or whatever game You know but only better and modern.

452
00:36:03,385 --> 00:36:10,339
Scott: you just have to have a few data files from the original game and you take it the new engine and Boom you've got an upgraded game, right?

453
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,809
Scott: It's suitable for the modern times, but here they're like.

454
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:16,537
Scott: you know what if you already own the game on Steam?

455
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:19,106
Rym: boom It's upgrade cuz it's just a patch.

456
00:36:19,206 --> 00:36:20,470
Rym: It's just up version.

457
00:36:20,831 --> 00:36:22,296
Rym: I forget what version number is.

458
00:36:22,376 --> 00:36:23,500
Rym: it just has a version number.

459
00:36:24,463 --> 00:36:28,173
Scott: Yeah, they did it for Quake 1 and then they for quake they.

460
00:36:28,234 --> 00:36:33,732
Scott: it was rumors cuz quake on kit happened Right that it was gonna come out, you know quake quake on that.

461
00:36:33,752 --> 00:36:34,495
Scott: They would announce it.

462
00:36:34,736 --> 00:36:35,700
Scott: Not only did they announce it?

463
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,303
Scott: They released.

464
00:36:36,343 --> 00:36:36,785
Scott: it's like.

465
00:36:36,805 --> 00:36:37,228
Scott: it's just like.

466
00:36:37,549 --> 00:36:42,700
Scott: hey guys if you have quake 2 on Steam It's upgraded now, and if you don't well you can buy it.

467
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:58,711
Scott: It's discounted now y'all and now you can enjoy quake 2. and not only did we upgrade it to be you know Basically better than all the fan-made engines out there and everything But we're also gonna throw in a whole new You know campaign and we're gonna throw in the.

468
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:01,660
Scott: you know the the quake 64 campaign also.

469
00:37:01,881 --> 00:37:12,225
Scott: Yeah, right cuz that if you way back in the day There was quake - quake and quake - for an instead of 64 and those had different maps and and you know I think it doesn't different enemies.

470
00:37:12,686 --> 00:37:13,529
Scott: basically they were different.

471
00:37:14,011 --> 00:37:15,315
Scott: You know the game part was different.

472
00:37:15,336 --> 00:37:16,520
Scott: It wasn't just the same game.

473
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:21,726
Scott: you know sort of Water down to work on an n64.

474
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:22,969
Scott: it actually changed the game.

475
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,034
Rym: So yep now full disclosure.

476
00:37:25,074 --> 00:37:39,112
Rym: I will admit this I have never played through even a materially a material amount of the single-player quake 1 or quake - I Mean it's basically just you know, it's 3d.

477
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:41,580
Scott: you aim up and down unlike doom, right?

478
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:46,619
Scott: Yeah, and it's fast and full of enemies everywhere and there's some dis of.

479
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:50,220
Scott: you know Get the key find the door find the secret stuff going on.

480
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,195
Scott: And then one thing a lot of players a lot of annoying platforming parts where you fall in lava.

481
00:37:54,657 --> 00:37:55,380
Scott: that kind of sucks.

482
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:00,960
Rym: Yeah, well partly because it's fascinating to play these again because I was poking at the single-player both quick one and quick - just you know.

483
00:38:01,082 --> 00:38:04,646
Rym: Just wanted to see These games on one hand.

484
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:09,020
Rym: They have a lot of annoyances like game design like level design as a science.

485
00:38:09,141 --> 00:38:10,890
Rym: It's better now than it was back then.

486
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:18,948
Scott: they added a compass to this one Which at least if that which is draws like these great you enable it It turns these green arrows to show you where the hell to go.

487
00:38:18,968 --> 00:38:22,540
Scott: Yeah, it would be very somewhat unplayable without it.

488
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,379
Scott: There'd be parts we'd be like running around in circles like not knowing where the hell to go.

489
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,398
Scott: Yeah, I'll be not for that.

490
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:38,599
Rym: So but when these games came out like that there weren't games like these before and that is something you need to Internalize if you play these games, yes, we're the ones.

491
00:38:39,425 --> 00:38:57,636
Scott: Yeah, people don't remember who weren't around then but basically 3d cards for your computer became a thing and so the Two games that were like the big-time games that came out where it was a battle between quake one and Duke Nukem 3d Which is and you know how that Duke Nukem forever right.

492
00:38:57,656 --> 00:38:58,860
Scott: the sequel to do a Google 3.

493
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,951
Scott: You know how that went right but the sequel to quake.

494
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:03,517
Scott: Well that actually happened.

495
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,528
Scott: Yeah We know who won that battle.

496
00:39:06,609 --> 00:39:08,700
Scott: it wasn't in the video game magazines.

497
00:39:08,881 --> 00:39:10,909
Scott: They made it out to be like, you know, it was.

498
00:39:10,929 --> 00:39:13,660
Scott: it was a SNES first Genesis battle.

499
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:15,295
Scott: It wasn't quick just one.

500
00:39:15,335 --> 00:39:15,699
Scott: Yeah, right.

501
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:31,663
Rym: but also there was you need to understand to how fast the iteration cycle was between when Doom 2 came out and Quake 2 came out was not that long like quake 1 came out in like summer of 1996.

502
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:34,992
Rym: Duke Nukem came out a few months before that.

503
00:39:35,654 --> 00:39:37,700
Rym: in 96 quake 2 came out in.

504
00:39:40,602 --> 00:39:45,555
Rym: Quake 1 was already obsolete within a year of quake 2 coming out, right?

505
00:39:45,595 --> 00:39:53,209
Scott: So wait quake 1 came out when right to Doom 2 is 94.

506
00:39:53,209 --> 00:40:14,280
Rym: So in just two years we went from doom 2 to quake 1 And in less than a year we went to Duke Nukem 3d which was actually really impressive for like what it was Which was predating quake 1. and then quake 2 just comes in Less than a year after quake 2. after what month did quick to come out?

507
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,900
Rym: About a year after and quake 2 just destroys the entire landscape.

508
00:40:20,723 --> 00:40:25,800
Rym: Yeah, quake 2 was like one of the biggest revolutions in video games up to that point.

509
00:40:26,462 --> 00:40:29,473
Scott: Yeah, quake 1 was like, okay, you can aim up and down now.

510
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:41,920
Scott: It's really 3d for real this time Yeah, but there wasn't like the first, you know descent also was like that But descent was a flying game though and not a you know descent was like a free, you know, six degrees of freedom whatever, right?

511
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,228
Scott: Yeah, when did descent?

512
00:40:44,228 --> 00:40:45,077
Scott: 1 came out?

513
00:40:45,077 --> 00:40:50,119
Scott: 95 so same time as like doom 2. so we already had the 3d games, right?

514
00:40:51,621 --> 00:40:55,076
Scott: But you know descent was a lot more like quake 1 and sort of.

515
00:40:55,157 --> 00:40:59,753
Scott: you know, yeah Right, and then quake 2 was like, alright now we're gonna.

516
00:40:59,974 --> 00:41:01,760
Scott: you know, we was the polishing right?

517
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,440
Scott: It's like they didn't polish the quake 1.

518
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:10,355
Rym: It's like they had it and they got it out when it was enough and you know why it was a groundbreaking game Because we'd never seen anything like that before.

519
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:13,410
Scott: no, yeah I mean, you know like other than descent.

520
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:22,100
Scott: right but it wasn't an FPS and you know Is not easy to play even today not because it's hard to get the software to run but because six degrees of freedom.

521
00:41:22,461 --> 00:41:23,725
Scott: Flying is just difficult.

522
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:25,871
Scott: Yeah, no matter what your controls are.

523
00:41:25,891 --> 00:41:28,800
Scott: I mean, even if you have a VR helmet, it's it's difficult.

524
00:41:29,924 --> 00:41:41,780
Rym: Not only was it just polished quake 2 had things like cutscenes NPCs that would interact with you like a kind of for real story like the single-player mode is big.

525
00:41:41,901 --> 00:41:43,247
Rym: I only didn't play it for other reasons.

526
00:41:43,268 --> 00:41:45,700
Scott: We'll get into the story isn't that much?

527
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,530
Scott: The story is aliens invaded and now we're gonna invade them back.

528
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:51,400
Rym: Yeah, but compare that to the story of doom.

529
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:58,261
Rym: There's no NPCs in doom Even any NPCs in quake 1.

530
00:41:58,261 --> 00:42:01,510
Scott: But yeah, just you know the polish and of quake 2 right.

531
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:08,100
Scott: it just polished quake 1 in in so many so many ways And it's partly because this was an era where you mentioned the 3d cars.

532
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:11,009
Rym: but a few other things were happening in around.

533
00:42:11,049 --> 00:42:18,973
Rym: when quake 2 came out is also when a bunch of Neighborhoods across the United States got access to some of the earliest broadband.

534
00:42:19,033 --> 00:42:27,220
Rym: like there were cable modem deployments all over America in random towns and also modems were getting like the 56k era was fully there.

535
00:42:27,561 --> 00:42:32,440
Rym: So and computers not even 3d cards were just getting faster and more people had them.

536
00:42:32,902 --> 00:42:34,232
Rym: So we had this confluence of.

537
00:42:34,252 --> 00:42:46,480
Rym: the technology was evolving So fast and a game came out that took advantage of that evolving technology Over the course of the quake doom quake quake 2 iterations and it was the perfect storm that changed everything.

538
00:42:49,696 --> 00:42:50,201
Rym: Well, yeah there is.

539
00:42:50,241 --> 00:42:51,487
Rym: I never played the single-player.

540
00:42:51,628 --> 00:42:52,049
Rym: was that?

541
00:42:52,130 --> 00:43:01,512
Rym: that was an error in my life where because I had a cable modem and Because I was already deep into quick one like and doom Online play all I wanted with death was deathmatch.

542
00:43:01,692 --> 00:43:03,237
Rym: All I wanted was multiplayer and mods.

543
00:43:03,518 --> 00:43:11,799
Rym: I Literally did not care that there was a single-player game in quake 2 Mmm, I bought it solely to play online with my friends.

544
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:13,598
Scott: That's you know.

545
00:43:13,781 --> 00:43:19,952
Scott: if you could if that was a thing you could do right when that wasn't a thing that Existed before then really easily with that.

546
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,580
Scott: What other game was there that you know?

547
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,813
Rym: It's like doom and quake and command and conquer all those.

548
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:26,119
Rym: you could do that and I did it.

549
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,510
Scott: You could but it was not everyone good.

550
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:34,978
Rym: I in high in middle school in high school I knew like four or five other people who were capable of doing it with me.

551
00:43:35,881 --> 00:43:42,099
Rym: Yeah, but my quick to like everyone in the neighborhood had quick to like people would be playing quake with each other after school.

552
00:43:42,983 --> 00:43:44,229
Scott: No, it was for some reason.

553
00:43:44,269 --> 00:43:51,880
Scott: It was you know, it was easier to play, you know quake one It's like, you know people had to like upgrade quake one with all sorts of mods to like get it to do.

554
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,226
Scott: You know, there's GL.

555
00:43:53,286 --> 00:43:55,034
Scott: quake was like an extra thing, right?

556
00:43:55,054 --> 00:43:56,300
Scott: It wasn't the default, right?

557
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:04,680
Scott: Whereas quake 2 was basically all those things from quake one that we know were you know need you need to add to quake one?

558
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:08,218
Scott: You didn't need to add them to quake to quake to had them built in because it was quick to.

559
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:42,010
Rym: So the other that I guess in terms of gameplay that because the I have the most experience with the multiplayer And I think it's worth pointing out that quake one is interesting to play Multiplayer like deathmatch in particular capture the flag or all the things you can play But it really is limited like it really doesn't hold up to a significant amount of play Even if you double down and try to get good the variety and the polish of quake to make it So much more of a game like.

560
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:50,106
Rym: it is such a compelling multiplayer experience compared to quake one that if you haven't played either I Almost wouldn't bother with quake one.

561
00:44:50,206 --> 00:44:51,571
Rym: unless you're interested in the history.

562
00:44:51,651 --> 00:44:54,160
Rym: quake two is the revolution, right?

563
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:07,539
Scott: Well quake two also, it's like yeah, there were plenty of mods for quake one But quake two that's where the mods ready counter-strike Effectively came out of the lineage of people modding quake two and then modding half-life action right to me.

564
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:11,754
Scott: Well half-life one was basically right like quake engine.

565
00:45:11,774 --> 00:45:13,500
Scott: then they modified that a whole, you know.

566
00:45:14,022 --> 00:45:17,354
Scott: But it's like half-life one has a lot in common with quake.

567
00:45:17,395 --> 00:45:22,434
Scott: to write you open the console You got a lot of same commands going on there and stuff right.

568
00:45:22,534 --> 00:45:24,060
Scott: software technology wise.

569
00:45:24,501 --> 00:45:27,931
Scott: Half-life warning as you know, it comes straight from quake two almost.

570
00:45:28,332 --> 00:45:31,340
Scott: and then you know counter-strike obviously is right on top of half-life.

571
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,605
Scott: What it's like all that's.

572
00:45:32,706 --> 00:45:34,172
Scott: and then the separate branch.

573
00:45:34,192 --> 00:45:38,591
Scott: at this point cuz Duke Duke and 3d died Right was the separate branch was the unreal branch.

574
00:45:38,631 --> 00:45:39,616
Scott: Yeah real tournament.

575
00:45:39,656 --> 00:45:40,319
Scott: That was the other.

576
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:44,660
Scott: Yeah, that was the you know, the the distant unrelated software, right?

577
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,712
Scott: But all the half-lives and the counter-strikes in the quakes.

578
00:45:48,073 --> 00:45:51,829
Scott: Those are all like in the same Family of the FPS.

579
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:53,034
Scott: is that still control the world.

580
00:45:53,336 --> 00:46:00,103
Rym: Yep, but like Yes, I played quick one online a bunch like with our friends and then nobody really wanted to play it much anymore Cuz we kind of got everything.

581
00:46:00,123 --> 00:46:00,927
Rym: we're gonna get out of it.

582
00:46:01,309 --> 00:46:06,181
Rym: I've been playing quick to online kind of often with people and I'm not good Like.

583
00:46:06,201 --> 00:46:07,205
Rym: don't don't don't mistake that.

584
00:46:07,286 --> 00:46:12,700
Rym: I'm good relative to like all the people out there who are great at quake, too But I'm about as good as I remember being.

585
00:46:14,181 --> 00:46:15,184
Rym: It's way fun.

586
00:46:15,285 --> 00:46:16,449
Rym: Like it is it is.

587
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:25,700
Rym: I would say quake to multiplayer deathmatch is Fun enough to be competitive with current modern online FPS's.

588
00:46:26,443 --> 00:46:39,988
Rym: It's also really really fast right good, especially compared to any FPS you're playing today Fortnight or quake 3 and you go play quake - Doug I don't know how you're gonna cope with it and then go play.

589
00:46:40,008 --> 00:46:41,374
Rym: quake 1 is like faster than that.

590
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,469
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of like driving, you know an f1 car.

591
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:48,380
Scott: It's like you could bet be a professional race car driver.

592
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:57,476
Scott: You've driven all kinds of fast cars, right and then you try to drive an f1 car and it's like oh fuck It's like step on the pedal a little and goes too fast, right?

593
00:46:57,556 --> 00:46:58,500
Scott: Oh shit, right?

594
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:04,160
Scott: It's like, you know, it's yet to handle it right and quake - you start running and you do a rocket jump.

595
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:05,044
Scott: It's like ha ha ha.

596
00:47:05,184 --> 00:47:08,860
Scott: It's it's you know, your guys moving too fast and then you die before you see anybody.

597
00:47:09,001 --> 00:47:10,106
Scott: It's like yeah, you know.

598
00:47:10,368 --> 00:47:12,760
Rym: or you just run you out of the hallway and then you're in the lava and you died.

599
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,207
Scott: It's like what?

600
00:47:13,633 --> 00:47:14,080
Scott: what happened?

601
00:47:15,421 --> 00:47:16,164
Rym: It's just the.

602
00:47:16,204 --> 00:47:20,479
Rym: the gameplay is so fast and furious that there aren't a lot of games that captured.

603
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:27,059
Rym: well There's a lot of games that have tried But honestly, I don't think a lot of them have really reached the level of gameplay polish that quake 2 had.

604
00:47:30,001 --> 00:47:31,987
Rym: So, what did they change in the remaster?

605
00:47:32,007 --> 00:47:37,303
Rym: because they did make changes like this is a new version of the graphics are Dramatically improved.

606
00:47:37,323 --> 00:47:39,188
Rym: Yep wide screen just works.

607
00:47:39,709 --> 00:47:40,853
Rym: I got a modern thing.

608
00:47:41,013 --> 00:47:42,236
Rym: high resolution just works.

609
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:45,888
Scott: You can even do local You know local split-screen.

610
00:47:45,908 --> 00:47:48,922
Scott: Yeah, if you want to do something like that You can works.

611
00:47:48,982 --> 00:47:56,367
Rym: now you can turn on and turn off whether if you had a video card with glide that could support the color Matt like the fancy color mapping or didn't.

612
00:47:56,788 --> 00:48:03,057
Rym: you can turn that on or off because most people had video cards that didn't show all The colors quake had or all the lighting that quake had.

613
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:06,650
Rym: It looks like you can get mods working.

614
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:07,453
Rym: I haven't tried yet.

615
00:48:07,534 --> 00:48:08,619
Rym: that's something I'm gonna look at later.

616
00:48:10,021 --> 00:48:12,512
Rym: They also made gameplay changes.

617
00:48:12,572 --> 00:48:14,540
Rym: they changed the recoil on the machine gun.

618
00:48:15,162 --> 00:48:18,572
Scott: They tweaked some of the recall on the machine gun in the original.

619
00:48:18,652 --> 00:48:21,140
Scott: quake was really made it hard to use.

620
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:23,140
Scott: Yeah, now the machine gun is significantly better.

621
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,226
Scott: It's like now.

622
00:48:24,286 --> 00:48:29,355
Scott: it's what it should have been which was a weaker chain gun But it uses less ammo because you use the chain gun.

623
00:48:29,375 --> 00:48:33,833
Scott: chain gun is amazing But you run out of ammo because it's a chain gun.

624
00:48:34,194 --> 00:48:40,720
Rym: they fixed quote Hundreds of level and gameplay bugs like they just fixed bugs.

625
00:48:41,021 --> 00:48:47,121
Rym: Imagine a game like quake how it came out in 1997 the year 2023.

626
00:48:47,121 --> 00:48:48,388
Rym: Hundred bugs just get fixed.

627
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:50,358
Scott: that were you can up the resolution to 4k.

628
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,788
Scott: I don't know if you could do that on the old one.

629
00:48:52,828 --> 00:48:55,459
Rym: Oh, you definitely could not right.

630
00:48:57,142 --> 00:49:00,640
Scott: If you have a high refresh rate monitor, you could run it at a higher rate.

631
00:49:00,821 --> 00:49:05,560
Rym: They fix the AI on a bunch of the enemies now to make them behave better in game.

632
00:49:05,881 --> 00:49:08,851
Rym: The berserker even has a new leap attack and there's like.

633
00:49:08,871 --> 00:49:10,196
Rym: they're like some of the monsters.

634
00:49:10,216 --> 00:49:11,480
Scott: Yeah, it's really dangerous.

635
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:20,970
Rym: Yeah, but the best part is the things that they added that I some some insufferable nerds are complaining that It's not the quake.

636
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:23,042
Rym: They remember It.

637
00:49:23,363 --> 00:49:28,202
Rym: I guess Bethesda straight-up said no these were things we tried to do in quake 2.

638
00:49:28,202 --> 00:49:30,640
Rym: We just ran out of time and had to release it like we couldn't get him done.

639
00:49:31,182 --> 00:49:33,371
Rym: This was the quake to remastered.

640
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,479
Rym: is our vision of what quake 2 was supposed to be?

641
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:37,224
Scott: Yeah, I love.

642
00:49:37,445 --> 00:49:38,791
Scott: I love the fact that it's like it's.

643
00:49:38,971 --> 00:49:40,960
Scott: it's not treated as like some separate game.

644
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,788
Scott: It's literally just like they.

645
00:49:42,969 --> 00:49:45,240
Scott: you know after all that time you did another version.

646
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:51,709
Scott: I would love to see not just games but like lots of software out there Right that you know just like.

647
00:49:51,749 --> 00:50:00,696
Scott: that's been old and un-updated for a long time But maybe someone is still using it somewhere like just have a new version right be like, you know What?

648
00:50:02,121 --> 00:50:02,542
Scott: What's what's?

649
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:06,054
Scott: an old software that you know, I guess, you know Winamp has failed at this.

650
00:50:06,635 --> 00:50:13,078
Scott: It's not always gonna succeed You know, I don't know if there's currently a word perfect out there, but I know a lot of people using old word.

651
00:50:13,118 --> 00:50:13,560
Scott: Perfect.

652
00:50:15,382 --> 00:50:17,477
Rym: It also ties into our panel in.

653
00:50:17,518 --> 00:50:25,844
Rym: that Was what was one of the first things we bought on that on steam when steam was not just the counter-strike updater But had things to buy.

654
00:50:26,186 --> 00:50:28,496
Rym: we bought with both of us bought a pack of every a game ever.

655
00:50:28,999 --> 00:50:29,300
Scott: That's right.

656
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:37,982
Scott: Well, that's what that's exactly That id pack of like the id toad all games id that had all the dooms and all the Wolfenstein's and all the quakes Right.

657
00:50:38,283 --> 00:50:44,488
Scott: That was the first one of the first things I bought on steam and the early 2000s 2001 2 3.

658
00:50:44,488 --> 00:50:45,516
Scott: I'm like that right.

659
00:50:45,919 --> 00:50:53,320
Scott: and That quake that I got in that bundle on the same steam account is the quake that just got a patch.

660
00:50:53,641 --> 00:50:57,620
Scott: So because I bought that then I have this now, right?

661
00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:11,426
Scott: It's literally the same item in the same steam library that was just updated and this is partly why like so after all these after 20 years plus years of steam I'm still playing the first game I bought on steam

662
00:51:11,646 --> 00:51:26,380
Rym: and beat between the history has got an update and the history of steam and the history of valve and the history of Bethesda and id give me a strong hope that Most games disappear or you have to struggle like you can't trust platforms to be around forever.

663
00:51:26,873 --> 00:51:37,793
Rym: but the legacy of id and the legacy of valve Regardless of if they could fuck us over one day They have a multi decade history of not fucking us over.

664
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:39,880
Rym: that is all huge history.

665
00:51:40,121 --> 00:51:44,873
Rym: That is a huge percentage of the entire history of the concept of video games.

666
00:51:45,434 --> 00:51:52,675
Scott: Yeah now there is something funny to mention That we don't need to comment on much because you already know everything there is to know about this, right?

667
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:56,859
Scott: But they've added Cloud save which is really nice.

668
00:51:58,124 --> 00:52:00,240
Scott: But they've also added cross play.

669
00:52:00,421 --> 00:52:05,800
Scott: So somebody playing quake on not a PC can play against someone like on a PC.

670
00:52:06,202 --> 00:52:12,320
Rym: I joined a cross play server a couple nights ago Mm-hmm, like lambs to the cosmic slaughter.

671
00:52:12,861 --> 00:52:13,968
Scott: well did?

672
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:19,660
Scott: I don't wonder if you're lying because In fact, if you try to play cross play, right?

673
00:52:20,242 --> 00:52:22,991
Scott: It will not allow you to use mouse and keyboard.

674
00:52:23,011 --> 00:52:25,700
Rym: cuz I enabled cross play in the lobby in the one we were playing.

675
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,004
Scott: I check the bottle it.

676
00:52:27,847 --> 00:52:32,260
Scott: from what I've heard if you play cross play everyone has to use a gamepad.

677
00:52:32,765 --> 00:52:33,936
Rym: That's a really good idea.

678
00:52:35,363 --> 00:52:36,658
Scott: Well, so we'll see.

679
00:52:38,762 --> 00:52:39,367
Scott: That's what I heard.

680
00:52:39,408 --> 00:52:40,396
Scott: I haven't actually attempted it.

681
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,706
Rym: So yeah, I will.

682
00:52:44,128 --> 00:52:46,519
Rym: next time we play I'll check that box and see what happens.

683
00:52:47,603 --> 00:52:49,850
Scott: Yeah, we'll have to experiment and verify.

684
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:52,399
Rym: I must just be good against most people.

685
00:52:54,581 --> 00:52:55,485
Scott: Or who knows?

686
00:52:55,806 --> 00:52:59,077
Scott: or maybe maybe that information is incorrect maybe Rym's lying who knows?

687
00:52:59,097 --> 00:53:14,016
Rym: yeah Anyway, the the other thing they've added to the game that is very important And this is another like big checkbox in their favor and they did this with a quake one remaster as well And we talked about it like they added a huge number of accessibility features.

688
00:53:14,779 --> 00:53:18,545
Scott: Oh, yeah Which like turning off flashing.

689
00:53:18,585 --> 00:53:28,016
Rym: so you don't get yeah things that even if Early game developers had thoughts to try to do them were not easy to do with the technology at the time.

690
00:53:28,457 --> 00:53:34,902
Rym: and the the fact That they committed to doing this along with the remaster is it's just a very important thing Like this is.

691
00:53:35,244 --> 00:53:38,075
Rym: there's nothing but good on this release.

692
00:53:38,316 --> 00:53:40,804
Rym: as far as I can see It looks better.

693
00:53:40,844 --> 00:53:42,830
Rym: it plays better like everything about this is great.

694
00:53:43,191 --> 00:53:56,716
Rym: if you don't own quake - I'd recommend getting quake - This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
