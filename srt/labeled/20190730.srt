1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,081
Rym: It's Tuesday, July 30th, 2019.

2
00:00:12,081 --> 00:00:12,543
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,563 --> 00:00:13,104
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,225 --> 00:00:18,256
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight, The Wizard's Grimoire, an RPG.

5
00:00:19,258 --> 00:00:20,341
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:22,806 --> 00:00:33,239
Rym: And to be clear, we are not talking about one that I had never heard of until I Googled for this, and I found this old, not great looking RPG that's also called The Wizard's Grimoire.

7
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:41,846
Rym: That apparently has at least four editions and it does not look great based on bicursory.

8
00:00:41,866 --> 00:00:43,693
Scott: Someone published it and people played it, right?

9
00:00:43,814 --> 00:00:46,003
Rym: I mean, the same could be said of Palladium Books.

10
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:46,907
Scott: True.

11
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:50,103
Rym: Did anyone actually use Palladium Books to play games, though?

12
00:00:50,203 --> 00:00:52,232
Scott: Yeah, but apparently not enough to keep them in business.

13
00:00:52,393 --> 00:00:53,236
Rym: But like, who?

14
00:00:53,356 --> 00:00:58,836
Rym: Like, who was the person who played RPGs using Palladium Books for that purpose?

15
00:00:58,856 --> 00:01:02,276
Scott: Right, it's like we see people who, like, I saw plenty of people like mourning their loss.

16
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:05,331
Rym: Like, at least Gamma World, like, I knew people who played Gamma World.

17
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,336
Rym: I had heard of Gamma World.

18
00:01:06,356 --> 00:01:12,621
Scott: But, like, I never met someone who, like, had a story of a session they played of a Palladium game.

19
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:19,231
Rym: Yeah, I remember every time I went to Millennium I would see this giant bookshelf of Palladium Books and every time I'd kind of laugh at them.

20
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:20,980
Scott: No one, nobody bought them.

21
00:01:21,201 --> 00:01:22,708
Rym: They were next to all those Besom supplements.

22
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:33,274
Scott: Everyone knew them, no one bought them, never met anyone who played one, but when they went away people were sad and were like, "No, I think a lot of RPGs are really just things people buy and read and don't

23
00:01:33,314 --> 00:01:33,555
Scott: play.".

24
00:01:33,716 --> 00:01:37,814
Rym: Well, like, Hall, the RPG that was designed to just be read and not actually played.

25
00:01:37,854 --> 00:01:38,135
Rym: Yes.

26
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:42,209
Rym: So, uh, yeah, we will link to the correct one.

27
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:44,582
Rym: We were talking about Vincent Baker's Wizard's Grimoire.

28
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:47,115
Scott: Yeah, we haven't done a GeekNights in a while, have we?

29
00:01:47,155 --> 00:01:51,334
Rym: Uh, no, we've been out of town, we've been busy, and we haven't talked about RPGs in a while either.

30
00:01:51,435 --> 00:01:52,338
Rym: It's an exciting show.

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,590
Scott: Yeah, I have a lot of RPGs I haven't played.

32
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,952
Rym: But we played the Wizard's, all I gotta say is, we played the Wizard's Grimoire three times.

33
00:02:01,013 --> 00:02:01,797
Scott: I played it three times.

34
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:06,883
Rym: I played it one time, and the second time when I was sitting next to a game, it was really hard to not jump in.

35
00:02:06,923 --> 00:02:07,908
Rym: You weren't actually playing.

36
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:09,719
Rym: Uh, the second game I wasn't supposed to play.

37
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,792
Scott: No, you weren't playing, you played it zero times.

38
00:02:11,872 --> 00:02:12,616
Rym: I played it the first game.

39
00:02:12,656 --> 00:02:14,525
Scott: You volunteered to assist in me playing.

40
00:02:14,585 --> 00:02:18,584
Rym: True, I was the assistant the first game, but the key fact is the second game.

41
00:02:18,624 --> 00:02:19,709
Scott: You have never played this game.

42
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:20,492
Rym: The second game.

43
00:02:20,532 --> 00:02:27,887
Rym: I was sitting next to the game, playing my Switch, and it was really, Scott Ed kept telling me to shut up because I was not technically one of the assistants.

44
00:02:27,927 --> 00:02:30,459
Scott: You were just sitting around while someone else played.

45
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,150
Rym: But I felt I wanted to be an assistant.

46
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,337
Rym: This game is real good.

47
00:02:35,357 --> 00:02:36,401
Scott: Go read your own grimoire.

48
00:02:36,522 --> 00:02:38,730
Scott: Maybe you'll go on a barbarian bloody quest.

49
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:44,361
Rym: I feel like, and this will save this for the end of the show, but I feel like we should do live sessions of this game on GeekNights.

50
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:46,331
Scott: Why don't you, you can go on a barbarian bloody quest.

51
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:50,043
Rym: Maybe I should, or I'm more invested in The Last Adventure.

52
00:02:51,428 --> 00:02:52,090
Rym: Because you're dead.

53
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:58,697
Rym: So there's a bunch of gaming news, so we're gonna be real selective about which ones we cover, because there's just so much.

54
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,467
Scott: Because you haven't done a show in so long.

55
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:03,761
Rym: Yeah, and also there's been a lot of gaming news lately.

56
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:07,496
Rym: that's notable, and we can't cover it all twice a month.

57
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,171
Rym: If you want to see gaming news as it happens, GeekNights is not the place.

58
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:24,821
Scott: Well anyway, the biggest gaming news, and obviously we don't play or give a shit about Fortnite, but the Fortnite World Cup happened, which I guess may have been the biggest esports event in history, so it's extremely notable.

59
00:03:24,841 --> 00:03:28,515
Scott: I guess it was bigger than the LUL, right?

60
00:03:28,656 --> 00:03:29,761
Scott: It was enormous, right?

61
00:03:29,821 --> 00:03:33,015
Scott: It was actually in New York, but we were out of town, so it's not like we could go.

62
00:03:33,035 --> 00:03:38,994
Rym: Yeah, you cannot underestimate the like, latent popularity of Fortnite.

63
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:42,747
Rym: This is possibly the most played game in human history.

64
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:52,568
Scott: Anyway, so at the event, I don't even know who won, but there were two major things that happened at the event that are notable to people who don't even care about Fortnite.

65
00:03:52,588 --> 00:03:53,853
Scott: You simply care about games.

66
00:03:54,214 --> 00:04:01,682
Scott: The first thing that happened was there was a player who had been, I guess, caught or widely believed to have cheated.

67
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,511
Scott: We might have done a story about this person earlier.

68
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:03,813
Scott: We did.

69
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:05,140
Rym: We talked about this at length.

70
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:11,812
Scott: It was a Fortnite cheater we've talked about on GeekNights in the past that somehow is still allowed to go to the World Cup despite cheating.

71
00:04:11,912 --> 00:04:16,004
Rym: Because the professionalized Fortnite is kind of amateur hour.

72
00:04:16,165 --> 00:04:20,761
Scott: Right, and this person at the Fortnite World Championship was eliminated.

73
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:24,536
Scott: I guess they still got some amount of money for, you know, whatever, right?

74
00:04:24,657 --> 00:04:26,264
Scott: But they were eliminated.

75
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:28,392
Scott: They did not become the Fortnite World Champion.

76
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:33,647
Scott: And when they were eliminated, the arena erupted in cheering.

77
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:37,621
Scott: People were so happy to see the evil cheater defeated.

78
00:04:37,641 --> 00:04:38,605
Scott: It was a good time.

79
00:04:38,926 --> 00:04:39,207
Scott: Yep.

80
00:04:39,227 --> 00:04:45,973
Scott: Alright, the second news, somebody who is significantly less evil, another Fortnite player, because I don't know they're, you know, whatever.

81
00:04:45,993 --> 00:04:48,097
Scott: For some reason.

82
00:04:48,258 --> 00:04:51,084
Scott: Let W1K3.

83
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:51,665
Scott: Okay.

84
00:04:52,387 --> 00:04:56,721
Scott: This player, while playing, they're playing, you know, it wasn't team based.

85
00:04:56,761 --> 00:04:58,270
Scott: It was just solo rounds or whatever.

86
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,376
Rym: Fourteen year old representing Russia.

87
00:05:00,396 --> 00:05:00,958
Rym: Okay.

88
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:03,046
Rym: No, representing Canvid Esports.

89
00:05:03,287 --> 00:05:03,588
Scott: Okay.

90
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:14,181
Scott: While they were playing, they happened to look over their monitor and were they were able to see these big giant screens for the spectators.

91
00:05:14,945 --> 00:05:18,245
Scott: And you're not supposed to look at those because there's information on those screens that you can't get.

92
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:20,738
Scott: Like, you might be able to see where another player is hiding, right?

93
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:25,838
Rym: Now, you may already, having listened to this, already be mad about that because that's ridiculous.

94
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:26,279
Scott: Right.

95
00:05:27,142 --> 00:05:30,755
Scott: Why are those screens visible from where the players are?

96
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:32,923
Rym: That's just stupid.

97
00:05:32,963 --> 00:05:41,734
Rym: It would be like if in Major League Baseball the jumbotron was in front of the batter so he could see it and it was zoomed in on the catcher's hands.

98
00:05:41,895 --> 00:05:42,277
Rym: Right.

99
00:05:42,317 --> 00:05:44,647
Rym: Like that's that's amateur hour crap.

100
00:05:44,787 --> 00:05:44,928
Rym: Right.

101
00:05:44,948 --> 00:05:49,369
Scott: Like if they showed all the signals from all the managers up on the big screen and everyone could see him.

102
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,697
Scott: Like look, Bridge.

103
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:57,074
Rym: If you play contact bridge, they put up these shields to make sure you can't look at your partner.

104
00:05:57,255 --> 00:05:57,556
Scott: Right.

105
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:00,084
Scott: So they met.

106
00:06:00,124 --> 00:06:01,307
Scott: this player was.

107
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:04,218
Scott: I don't think they were disqualified or fined.

108
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,018
Rym: But after quote after multiple warnings to the player, a penalty was assessed and he was removed from the match.

109
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,713
Rym: He was not disqualified and will not be fined.

110
00:06:12,295 --> 00:06:15,208
Scott: And he still took home like a pile of money, but not a win.

111
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:15,670
Scott: He could have won.

112
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,133
Scott: Who knows?

113
00:06:16,253 --> 00:06:16,394
Scott: Right.

114
00:06:16,415 --> 00:06:17,220
Scott: You never know what could happen.

115
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:17,381
Scott: Right.

116
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:18,469
Scott: You're still playing.

117
00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:19,473
Scott: You still got a chance to win.

118
00:06:20,014 --> 00:06:28,143
Rym: It's one thing if you cheat by doing something like, I don't know, hacking your monitor to be able to see someone else's screen picture.

119
00:06:28,244 --> 00:06:31,438
Scott: I guess complain that they weren't given the right keyboard or something.

120
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:32,482
Scott: But that's irrelevant.

121
00:06:32,523 --> 00:06:38,107
Scott: The point is, I think if I was this player, I would be like, hey, why the fuck was that even visible?

122
00:06:38,348 --> 00:06:39,855
Rym: Oh, Lord, look at these screenshots.

123
00:06:39,915 --> 00:06:42,569
Rym: The jumbotron is like, you can't not look at this thing.

124
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:42,810
Rym: Right.

125
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:52,101
Scott: But yeah, this is not only was this maybe the biggest e-sport event in history is probably the highest production value e-sport event in history.

126
00:06:52,582 --> 00:07:08,255
Scott: And to have a fuck up so basic is really, really, I think, casts a further shade of, you know, over the whole legit competitive e-sport counterpoint.

127
00:07:08,576 --> 00:07:17,728
Rym: It may not matter because in the early days of American professional sports like hockey, the officiating was just corrupt, made up nonsense half the time.

128
00:07:17,748 --> 00:07:22,665
Rym: Like games would get canceled because the power went out or the ice melted.

129
00:07:22,685 --> 00:07:27,264
Rym: Like professional sports was amateur hour for like 50 years.

130
00:07:27,284 --> 00:07:28,228
Scott: It's been amateur hour.

131
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:31,986
Scott: It's like when you were watching it as kids in the 80s and 90s, didn't feel like amateur hour.

132
00:07:32,046 --> 00:07:34,317
Scott: But now you look at what we have, how far we've come.

133
00:07:34,358 --> 00:07:38,314
Scott: If you look back just like the 90s, it's like, wow, what?

134
00:07:38,354 --> 00:07:39,681
Rym: Dude, I was we were watching.

135
00:07:39,761 --> 00:07:42,072
Rym: we saw that documentary about the Red Wings in the Russian five.

136
00:07:42,273 --> 00:07:48,954
Rym: So we saw like long under under erupted segments of play from like a hockey game in 1996.

137
00:07:48,954 --> 00:07:51,119
Rym: That shit is barely officiated.

138
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:51,600
Rym: Yeah.

139
00:07:53,023 --> 00:07:59,481
Rym: So in some other news, Bethesda, Bethesda, I feel like Bethesda is a verb at this point.

140
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:04,966
Rym: But if you're not aware, you're probably you might not actually be aware of why these means were happening.

141
00:08:05,348 --> 00:08:10,726
Rym: But there was a huge amount of memes around someone's trying to do something.

142
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:13,436
Rym: And then the next panel was just sorry.

143
00:08:13,537 --> 00:08:16,549
Rym: A Bethesda dot net account is required to play this title, right?

144
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:19,823
Scott: So what happened was to continue complete surprise to everyone.

145
00:08:19,884 --> 00:08:22,695
Scott: No one knew this wasn't announced in advance, which I think is good.

146
00:08:23,357 --> 00:08:26,728
Scott: They just put Doom, Doom two, Doom three on switch.

147
00:08:28,471 --> 00:08:31,084
Scott: And I think some other platforms, maybe they just put it out there.

148
00:08:31,486 --> 00:08:32,793
Scott: And now I don't think what do I need?

149
00:08:32,894 --> 00:08:34,081
Scott: Doom on my switch, right?

150
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:37,881
Rym: Because on one hand, you might think like, oh, a first person shooter without a mouse and keyboard.

151
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,087
Rym: What bullshit is this?

152
00:08:39,148 --> 00:08:41,657
Rym: However, imagine this scenario.

153
00:08:41,697 --> 00:08:43,044
Rym: You go to a con with your friends.

154
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:44,071
Rym: You're hanging out in a hotel room.

155
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:48,107
Rym: You'll have switches and you just play multiplayer Doom together, right?

156
00:08:48,168 --> 00:08:51,926
Scott: Then they have somehow not only it's like, oh, do my switch, whatever.

157
00:08:51,986 --> 00:08:53,252
Scott: I wouldn't pay even a dollar for that.

158
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:56,807
Scott: I got every doom, everything ever and quake, everything ever on my PC.

159
00:08:57,128 --> 00:09:04,449
Scott: But no, they added co-op and multiplayer that just works without having to fuck around.

160
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:06,797
Rym: One in Doom two are not actually 3D.

161
00:09:06,877 --> 00:09:08,603
Rym: You don't need to aim up and down.

162
00:09:08,985 --> 00:09:15,470
Rym: And yes, while even in a game like that, a controller is objectively, ridiculously inferior to a mouse and keyboard.

163
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,192
Scott: Good enough.

164
00:09:16,453 --> 00:09:20,932
Rym: If you've all got the same controllers and you're in the same room together, that shit is lit.

165
00:09:20,952 --> 00:09:21,815
Scott: Better than GoldenEye.

166
00:09:22,197 --> 00:09:27,578
Rym: The only thing, the only thing that had to get right is that it has to just work.

167
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,445
Rym: And that is what Bethesda fucked up.

168
00:09:29,545 --> 00:09:29,746
Rym: Right.

169
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:33,021
Scott: So apparently to make this work, you need to Bethesda login.

170
00:09:33,101 --> 00:09:34,327
Scott: And it's like, what the fuck?

171
00:09:34,688 --> 00:09:38,364
Rym: I feel like most people, their first thought was, what the fuck is Bethesda.net?

172
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,107
Scott: Right.

173
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:40,714
Rym: No one knows what Bethesda is.

174
00:09:40,774 --> 00:09:43,465
Scott: Imagine some little kid who buys doom on his switch.

175
00:09:43,906 --> 00:09:44,248
Scott: Right.

176
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:48,085
Scott: Or some, you know, it's like they turn it on and it's like, you must log in.

177
00:09:48,145 --> 00:09:49,672
Scott: It's like, what the fuck?

178
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:56,177
Scott: I feel like Bethesda on that account is required to go to his computer, go to Bethesda.net, making it who knows what the fuck.

179
00:09:56,297 --> 00:09:56,539
Rym: Yeah.

180
00:09:57,021 --> 00:09:58,248
Scott: And anyway, so they're changed.

181
00:09:58,268 --> 00:10:00,840
Scott: They're like, they're claiming it was a mistake, which is bullshit.

182
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:02,710
Scott: And they're going to change it.

183
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,432
Scott: So it's optional.

184
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:06,522
Rym: There is no way this was an accident.

185
00:10:06,602 --> 00:10:07,565
Rym: It was a mistake.

186
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:16,520
Rym: No, I mean, it should at least admit it was just a mistake that no one cares about you and just take your money from the fact that this is a brilliant idea.

187
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:26,248
Rym: The only thing that could have been better than this, if someone had thought to just make a good FPS that was designed for controllers that just worked and sell it on the switch as an indie game.

188
00:10:26,268 --> 00:10:27,654
Scott: I mean, they did, but it wasn't on the switch.

189
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:28,296
Scott: It was called halo.

190
00:10:29,881 --> 00:10:30,905
Rym: It was called golden high.

191
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:32,671
Scott: It was better than gold.

192
00:10:32,892 --> 00:10:40,647
Rym: Kalo is a lot better than golden high, but doom is like this perfect storm because the fact that it's this two point five D at least do one in Doom two.

193
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,536
Scott: It's not really two point five D.

194
00:10:42,577 --> 00:10:43,260
Rym: Yeah, it is.

195
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,298
Scott: Two point five D is usually referred to like, you know, like Smash Brothers.

196
00:10:47,318 --> 00:10:47,921
Rym: So here's the deal.

197
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:48,182
Rym: Doom.

198
00:10:48,202 --> 00:10:53,387
Rym: I know a lot about the Doom engine because I was, do you have a three D game, but your camera is fixed, right?

199
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:54,070
Scott: It's a flat.

200
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,260
Scott: So I was, everything moves on a flat plane.

201
00:10:56,321 --> 00:11:01,789
Rym: So I was deep into the Doom modding community when I was younger, but basically the way the Doom engine works is fascinating.

202
00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:03,015
Rym: I'm not going to get into all the details.

203
00:11:03,036 --> 00:11:14,519
Rym: That'd be a whole show, but basically the game is two D in that no Sprite, like no object can ever be on top of or underneath another object that cannot overlap on the top down two D plane.

204
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:24,072
Rym: However, every object, every missile, every enemy, everything other than the floor, because I don't want to get into explaining like sectors.

205
00:11:24,132 --> 00:11:30,573
Rym: Now that works has a Z coordinate and the game uses that to render how high it looks like it is.

206
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:36,256
Rym: But if you aim at something, uh, say I aim at an imp that's way above me, I'm still looking straight ahead.

207
00:11:36,678 --> 00:11:46,881
Rym: If I have an aim at the, at the two D coordinate, that thing is my bullet will just go up as far as I can see it and hit that guy because the Z component is purely for rendering and display.

208
00:11:46,901 --> 00:11:48,287
Rym: It doesn't do anything else.

209
00:11:48,568 --> 00:11:50,536
Rym: That's how you can like fall off of stuff.

210
00:11:52,001 --> 00:11:54,953
Rym: Uh, but yeah, Doom is basically the perfect storm for this kind of thing.

211
00:11:54,993 --> 00:12:05,032
Scott: Bringing it out on the switch with multiplayers, the brilliant idea and Bethesda just expose a generation of younger non PC gamers to do maybe, yeah, do just be nice on its own.

212
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:07,521
Rym: Doom co-op is legitimately fun.

213
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:16,336
Scott: I see so many people on like switch discussion places on the internet who are like, bring this to switch, bring this to switch, please remake this thing on switch.

214
00:12:16,617 --> 00:12:21,217
Scott: And it's like, people is the switch literally the other, like, please bring Netflix to switch.

215
00:12:21,237 --> 00:12:24,572
Scott: It's like, is this the only fucking computing device you own?

216
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:29,245
Scott: So it's like I, you only need a switch to play rather the wild Mario maker.

217
00:12:29,646 --> 00:12:41,713
Rym: So Jesus Christ, actually, so I didn't, I wasn't gonna make this my news cause I was gonna wait for later numbers, but projections are that the switch may soon have outsold the fucking Super Nintendo.

218
00:12:41,854 --> 00:12:43,524
Scott: Yeah, no, the switches are, nothing's the outsell.

219
00:12:43,544 --> 00:12:50,613
Scott: the we though, but the point is a or a DS maybe, but the point is the switch is selling a lot, but it's like, kids do not have laptops.

220
00:12:50,754 --> 00:12:58,341
Scott: Yeah, but I can't imagine having a switch and not having like a phone or a computer or literally any other thing ever.

221
00:12:58,461 --> 00:13:01,211
Rym: You don't interact with regular people that often.

222
00:13:01,272 --> 00:13:03,101
Scott: It's like the switch is the only thing you own.

223
00:13:03,142 --> 00:13:06,358
Scott: You need every piece of software that everyone else has and all their other things.

224
00:13:06,378 --> 00:13:06,981
Scott: You know what it is?

225
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:09,031
Scott: You know what it is?

226
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:09,975
Rym: They don't own a tablet.

227
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:11,281
Rym: They don't have a laptop.

228
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:16,486
Rym: They have a phone, but the switch is a way better screen and they don't know anything about it.

229
00:13:16,506 --> 00:13:17,190
Rym: Technology works.

230
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:25,989
Scott: You don't have a TV with like some sort of some box connected to it, even if it's not a real HD, VC, you don't have a computer, not one they can carry with them.

231
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:26,813
Rym: They don't have an iPad.

232
00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:27,676
Rym: Those are expensive.

233
00:13:27,797 --> 00:13:30,468
Scott: It's like you get a Kindle fire or whatever.

234
00:13:30,488 --> 00:13:31,834
Rym: Yeah, those cost 20 bucks.

235
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,830
Scott: I'm making is that if you don't have any of those things, why are you buying?

236
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,879
Rym: the chat is even like room is right on this.

237
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:41,456
Scott: If you don't have any of those things, why are you buying switch?

238
00:13:41,476 --> 00:13:42,822
Scott: You should buy iPad first.

239
00:13:43,124 --> 00:13:43,586
Scott: You know what?

240
00:13:43,626 --> 00:13:45,073
Rym: Second, I would buy switch first.

241
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:50,225
Scott: Well, you have, cause I, I would buy a switch for you to get rid of all your computers and all your everything else and have just a switch.

242
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:52,036
Scott: That would be the last device you would get rid of.

243
00:13:52,056 --> 00:13:52,399
Rym: No, no, no.

244
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:57,688
Rym: I would buy switch first because I already have a phone because you have a phone and I would just learn a phone.

245
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,601
Scott: Then why do you fucking need all this other shit on the switch?

246
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:03,323
Rym: One because they don't want to use their phone to phone doesn't have a good controller or games on it.

247
00:14:03,363 --> 00:14:03,624
Rym: Really.

248
00:14:03,665 --> 00:14:05,954
Scott: This isn't, I'm not talking about just games like others.

249
00:14:05,974 --> 00:14:13,600
Rym: I don't know people that you, we are already in a rarefied class of people who know a lot about this stuff.

250
00:14:13,861 --> 00:14:15,548
Rym: Most people buy more shit.

251
00:14:15,609 --> 00:14:17,660
Scott: If you got enough money to buy a switch, you can buy more shit.

252
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:19,229
Scott: Oh, I got a good shooter.

253
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:20,213
Rym: Good quote in the stream.

254
00:14:20,253 --> 00:14:23,043
Rym: If my Brazilian ass gets enough money, I'll get a switch first.

255
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:28,625
Scott: You'd have a switch and not have a phone or a tablet or a computer.

256
00:14:28,746 --> 00:14:29,147
Rym: You know what?

257
00:14:29,187 --> 00:14:30,192
Scott: You'd go only switch.

258
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:32,930
Scott: If you had to go down to one device, that would be the last one you get rid of.

259
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,472
Scott: You know what?

260
00:14:33,592 --> 00:14:36,685
Rym: I've had more fun on my switch than I have on my phone.

261
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:38,572
Rym: My phone is not a fun device.

262
00:14:38,592 --> 00:14:40,157
Rym: My phone is a necessary device.

263
00:14:40,558 --> 00:14:40,859
Scott: Anyway.

264
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:52,729
Rym: Anyway, so I talked about this briefly last time, but Overwatch had a ton of changes, but now that I've actually like really looked into them, analyzed them, thought about them a lot, there's good stuff going on here.

265
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,176
Rym: This is really interesting what's happening.

266
00:14:54,197 --> 00:14:58,900
Scott: Well, the only thing that I read actually is, A, people are, there's some role cues.

267
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,166
Scott: You can always be what you want to be.

268
00:15:00,186 --> 00:15:01,957
Rym: Yeah, but there's a lot more to it than that.

269
00:15:01,977 --> 00:15:07,164
Scott: Alright, I'm sure we'll hear about it, but the other thing I read was actually Take This wrote an article today about the new character.

270
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:08,370
Rym: I saw that.

271
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,543
Rym: I wasn't going to talk about that, but I did read that article.

272
00:15:10,684 --> 00:15:15,565
Scott: And how the new character is like a bad trope and stereotype of people with mental illness.

273
00:15:15,806 --> 00:15:16,950
Rym: Well, it's, it's complicated.

274
00:15:17,051 --> 00:15:18,399
Scott: I don't know anything about the new character.

275
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,234
Rym: So the new character is basically someone who did a Dr.

276
00:15:21,274 --> 00:15:23,826
Rym: Manhattan type experiment and it like broke his brain.

277
00:15:24,027 --> 00:15:24,891
Scott: Instead of becoming Dr.

278
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,318
Scott: Manhattan, he just sort of messed up.

279
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:29,773
Rym: He's messed up and he has like power over time and gravity.

280
00:15:30,154 --> 00:15:30,796
Scott: Oh, okay.

281
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,705
Rym: And he can't remember who he, like he lost himself.

282
00:15:33,825 --> 00:15:35,772
Scott: Like he's, it's creepy.

283
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:35,893
Scott: Dr.

284
00:15:35,913 --> 00:15:37,563
Scott: Manhattan had the opposite of the thing though.

285
00:15:37,744 --> 00:15:37,985
Scott: Yeah.

286
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:39,151
Scott: His brain went, got better.

287
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:40,256
Scott: Yeah.

288
00:15:40,336 --> 00:15:41,501
Scott: From a certain point of view.

289
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:45,899
Rym: Yeah, but from another point of view, he lost the concept of what humans are.

290
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:46,964
Scott: Yes, indeed.

291
00:15:47,124 --> 00:15:52,083
Rym: It's one of those kinds of things, which is complicated because it's a, it is a negative.

292
00:15:52,384 --> 00:16:03,390
Rym: It is a potentially negative depiction of mental illness, but simultaneously there are other characters in Overwatch who are more positive representations of, I will not say mental illness, but of a neuro-typical people.

293
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,308
Rym: And I have not looked into this enough to comment on that issue.

294
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:09,272
Scott: No, I'll just say, read this.

295
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:10,035
Scott: I did.

296
00:16:10,075 --> 00:16:12,988
Scott: I read the article, but other people read that article.

297
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:16,324
Scott: Yeah, I'll take any R word for it because I don't have a word.

298
00:16:16,364 --> 00:16:19,379
Rym: I'll link to it in the show notes because it is a, it's a, it's a good article.

299
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:19,761
Rym: to read it.

300
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:26,323
Rym: You should think about this kind of thing, but, uh, talk about the do the role cue thing.

301
00:16:26,724 --> 00:16:26,884
Rym: Yeah.

302
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:32,686
Rym: So Overwatch in general is doing pretty much everything right when it comes to e-sports.

303
00:16:32,706 --> 00:16:36,947
Rym: They're trying the hardest, like they're trying the hardest to make it real and professional and modern.

304
00:16:37,249 --> 00:16:39,419
Rym: They're not having the amateur hour kind of crap.

305
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:41,086
Scott: They care about legitimacy.

306
00:16:41,407 --> 00:16:51,273
Rym: They're trying, they're trying like, you know, home games and like league, like leagues that are based on like home and away schedules and teams that are based in city, like they're doing everything right.

307
00:16:51,715 --> 00:16:56,453
Rym: But there was this, but there were two things that happened in Overwatch that were a problem.

308
00:16:56,814 --> 00:17:02,417
Rym: And viewership of Overwatch league was going down and players of Overwatch were less engaged.

309
00:17:02,437 --> 00:17:05,070
Rym: Like people were giving up on the game or at least weren't playing it as much.

310
00:17:06,074 --> 00:17:12,917
Rym: On one hand in league, there was a particular meta that it involved that it mean Overwatch league, not league.

311
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:15,492
Scott: Usually when people just say league, they mean league of legends.

312
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:15,772
Scott: Yup.

313
00:17:16,074 --> 00:17:19,127
Rym: Overwatch people, when they say league, they mean Overwatch league.

314
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:21,157
Scott: Usually you say owl or something.

315
00:17:21,178 --> 00:17:24,316
Rym: Well, like if you live in New York, when you say the city, you mean New York city.

316
00:17:24,396 --> 00:17:24,597
Scott: No.

317
00:17:24,637 --> 00:17:27,170
Scott: If you live on earth and you say the city, you mean New York city.

318
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:35,035
Rym: If you live in Europe, you might mean London because London is a, I will argue that London is a peer to New York.

319
00:17:35,456 --> 00:17:39,069
Rym: It is the only pair to New York, but it is a peer to New York.

320
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:47,244
Rym: So in league, a meta involved that is incredibly boring to watch.

321
00:17:47,644 --> 00:17:48,065
Scott: Okay.

322
00:17:48,205 --> 00:17:52,195
Rym: Unless you are a professional or a serious player.

323
00:17:52,396 --> 00:17:54,322
Scott: But that's true of all sports.

324
00:17:54,523 --> 00:17:56,650
Scott: Is that the most conservative strategy?

325
00:17:56,771 --> 00:17:57,775
Scott: is the strongest strategy.

326
00:17:57,796 --> 00:18:03,096
Rym: For example, the New Jersey devils, the New England Patriots are boring, but they win.

327
00:18:03,117 --> 00:18:03,999
Scott: That's right.

328
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:09,997
Rym: Me as an enlightened enjoyer of games, I appreciate what they do, even though I hate them.

329
00:18:10,258 --> 00:18:10,459
Scott: Yup.

330
00:18:10,961 --> 00:18:14,213
Rym: But I appreciate the craft and I appreciate someone who plays.

331
00:18:14,253 --> 00:18:16,461
Scott: It's funny to say that when the owner's name is Robert Kraft.

332
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:19,632
Rym: He's a bad person.

333
00:18:20,414 --> 00:18:20,936
Rym: Yeah, he is.

334
00:18:21,577 --> 00:18:27,495
Rym: But, or for example, like as someone who plays a lot of Overwatch, I'm fine with that meta.

335
00:18:27,676 --> 00:18:30,828
Rym: I love watching the triple tank, triple, triple healer.

336
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:32,454
Scott: Like, is that the strategy?

337
00:18:32,594 --> 00:18:32,896
Scott: Yeah.

338
00:18:32,936 --> 00:18:38,097
Scott: Basically you get three tanks, three healers, no, no snipers, no DPS, no nothing.

339
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:38,680
Scott: DPS doesn't matter.

340
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,926
Rym: It's just a game of attrition.

341
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:42,419
Rym: It's just, it's basically two teams, posturing.

342
00:18:42,439 --> 00:18:46,719
Scott: So if you have three tanks and three healers who make this unkillable blob.

343
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:47,682
Scott: Two unkillable blobs.

344
00:18:47,703 --> 00:18:49,489
Scott: And what if the other team has like DPS?

345
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,877
Scott: Couldn't they do enough DPS?

346
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:53,181
Rym: You can't bring them down.

347
00:18:53,202 --> 00:18:57,035
Scott: So why don't they decrease the rates of healing and HP on the tanks?

348
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:58,601
Rym: I don't think so.

349
00:18:58,761 --> 00:19:02,215
Scott: So that a DPS concentrating on a tank could take it down, even if it's being healed.

350
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:04,044
Rym: I will get back to that actually.

351
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:04,386
Scott: Okay.

352
00:19:04,788 --> 00:19:07,664
Rym: So, cause I have another news I want to link to briefly that's related to this.

353
00:19:07,885 --> 00:19:09,653
Scott: Like sniper shot, kiss you in the head.

354
00:19:09,693 --> 00:19:10,175
Scott: You should be dead.

355
00:19:10,195 --> 00:19:10,878
Scott: It doesn't matter.

356
00:19:10,898 --> 00:19:11,159
Scott: Right?

357
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:17,923
Rym: So this meta is fun for professionals to watch and play and boring for everyone else.

358
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:21,575
Rym: See also American baseball for many people.

359
00:19:22,177 --> 00:19:23,361
Scott: The battery, especially now.

360
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:23,843
Rym: Yeah.

361
00:19:23,883 --> 00:19:31,253
Rym: Like the battery is still interesting to people who care a lot about it and know a lot about it and is completely boring to anyone else.

362
00:19:32,478 --> 00:19:36,212
Rym: And if you don't know what the battery is, then you were probably bored by baseball.

363
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:58,153
Rym: So, uh, when Overwatch announced that they were going to have this role lock, meaning your team must consist of two DPS, two tank, two support, like a lot of people assumed that that was to prevent this meta from ruining the professional spectator aspect of Overwatch.

364
00:19:58,996 --> 00:20:07,644
Rym: But that's not entirely true because they applied this to all Overwatch, even quick play, even like regular old bronze tier competitive.

365
00:20:07,684 --> 00:20:11,516
Scott: So no matter what mode you can't just change.

366
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,144
Scott: So they took strategy out of the game.

367
00:20:13,164 --> 00:20:15,293
Scott: You can no longer decide your team composition.

368
00:20:15,594 --> 00:20:19,508
Scott: The number of possible team compositions was decreased dramatically.

369
00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:21,734
Rym: Well, so in the arcade you can still do like.

370
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,480
Rym: there's a million modes and custom servers.

371
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:33,380
Rym: You can do normal mode, but even like capture the flag is still, there are a lot of DPS, like there are a lot of options in these three.

372
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:39,848
Scott: There is still, I'm sure, I'm sure there are still a large number, but it was a vast decrease from an even more crazy large number.

373
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:40,170
Scott: Yes.

374
00:20:40,731 --> 00:20:47,813
Rym: But I would analogize this to the rules of who you put on the field and where you put them in football.

375
00:20:48,475 --> 00:20:57,542
Rym: If football did not have like the role of wide receiver or the concept of eligible receivers, the game would break down into a really boring meta.

376
00:20:58,204 --> 00:21:02,099
Scott: Baseball, you can do other things in football.

377
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:08,670
Scott: Like you could just put like a huge dude out there as your quarterback if you really want, but there's no, you know, it's like you can't like.

378
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:10,879
Rym: there's rules on like eligible receivers.

379
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:18,504
Rym: Like there's rules to limit what role a player can play in a given like play, uh, other professionals like hockey.

380
00:21:18,926 --> 00:21:21,977
Rym: You can't just say I'm at two goalies and four people on the ice.

381
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,123
Rym: Can't do that.

382
00:21:23,524 --> 00:21:26,359
Rym: You can't just be like, yeah, four of my players are wearing goalie pads.

383
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:29,615
Scott: You could have one person in goalie pad and someone else just hang out with them.

384
00:21:29,816 --> 00:21:31,443
Scott: You could wear normal gear.

385
00:21:31,804 --> 00:21:32,045
Scott: Yeah.

386
00:21:32,105 --> 00:21:33,270
Rym: And the same thing in Overwatch.

387
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:37,726
Rym: The DPS could like do a tanky, like try to act like a tank.

388
00:21:37,746 --> 00:21:45,618
Scott: You could get some, you could get say your backup goalie in non goalie gear, hang out near the goal in front of your real goalie or maybe to the side.

389
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:52,505
Scott: And they have, you know, they do some Evangelion episode whatever DDR episode trading to where they're in sync, right?

390
00:21:52,585 --> 00:21:54,876
Rym: So in Overwatch now you can have one of your two tanks.

391
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,747
Rym: So you wanted to play a more DPS focused game.

392
00:21:57,028 --> 00:22:00,362
Rym: You can have one of your two tanks pick a more DPS focused tank.

393
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:05,905
Rym: So there are still a lot, there's a lot of fungibility there, but it forces a certain level of structure.

394
00:22:05,945 --> 00:22:13,917
Rym: And I really analogize it to football because it does just so happens that the meta of the game is extremely boring to spectators unless you do things like that.

395
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:18,090
Rym: And, uh, what do we always say on GeekNights?

396
00:22:18,351 --> 00:22:19,255
Rym: Professional sports.

397
00:22:19,496 --> 00:22:21,684
Rym: The only people that matter are the spectators.

398
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:24,336
Rym: Nothing else matters except for health and safety.

399
00:22:24,858 --> 00:22:27,871
Scott: Well, there's, you know, there's legitimacy and then spectators, right?

400
00:22:27,891 --> 00:22:30,568
Rym: Well, I would argue that legitimate, they don't always go together.

401
00:22:30,628 --> 00:22:35,745
Scott: Cause if you see the incredibly illegitimate FIFA soccer as the most spectators on earth.

402
00:22:35,966 --> 00:22:36,327
Rym: True.

403
00:22:36,347 --> 00:22:47,755
Scott: And the extremely, you know, the other thing, you know, I guess the most legitimate sport would be basketball probably, even though it's got some issues, but you know, actually more exciting.

404
00:22:48,015 --> 00:22:50,383
Scott: I would almost basketball has more spectator.

405
00:22:50,464 --> 00:22:58,030
Rym: I would almost analogize soccer to Fortnite in the sense that soccer has terrible governance and re and terrible officiating.

406
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,906
Scott: There are, there are things though that have worse governance in Fortnite.

407
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:01,228
Rym: Oh yeah.

408
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:09,908
Rym: But I'm saying that Fortnite is similar in that people are invested in Fortnite as a concept to the point that all those other mistakes don't actually matter to the fan base.

409
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:11,735
Rym: Maybe soccer is very similar.

410
00:23:11,836 --> 00:23:16,374
Scott: Boo that cheating guy or cheer when he lost or, you know, whatever they ate a cheating guy.

411
00:23:16,555 --> 00:23:16,836
Rym: Yup.

412
00:23:16,856 --> 00:23:19,489
Scott: So they cared about the legitimacy to quite an extent.

413
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:26,680
Rym: So here's the thing, cause I don't, I can't turn this, I can't turn this into Rym talking about overwatch for an hour cause we have an RPG to talk about.

414
00:23:27,283 --> 00:23:36,713
Rym: So they applied these changes everywhere, not just in the pro modes because the, it wasn't that the meadow was the problem with everyone else.

415
00:23:37,134 --> 00:23:47,930
Rym: It was that people like players of games in general, the average person are incapable of talking to each other and are incapable of forming a valid team composition.

416
00:23:49,070 --> 00:24:11,728
Rym: So by forcing the same role lock in the regular modes that they force in the professional modes, even if the people who happen to be matched up with you on a random game that you play in just a regular old mode might be utter pieces of shit or incapable of talking to each other, they cannot ruin the team composition, which matters a lot.

417
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:19,922
Rym: Imagine if football like American football, we're an online game where everyone plays a role and you join a team and it's 12 people.

418
00:24:19,962 --> 00:24:24,138
Rym: Let's say they just say you get 12 people and eight of them just say, I'm playing a wide receiver.

419
00:24:24,178 --> 00:24:24,639
Rym: Fuck you.

420
00:24:25,503 --> 00:24:25,663
Scott: Yeah.

421
00:24:25,724 --> 00:24:36,060
Scott: I think the main thing is though is that, you know, when you look at a lot of the e-sports, especially the FPSs, there are games in which there's no stoppage.

422
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,810
Scott: There's no plays really to usually, right?

423
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,758
Scott: Everyone can go everywhere and do everything.

424
00:24:41,778 --> 00:24:42,500
Scott: Yeah.

425
00:24:42,901 --> 00:24:54,148
Scott: And it's like, okay, you know, I think what we need to do, you know, the, the role lock is, is, is a fine solution for a game like overwatch, assuming you don't need to want to fundamentally change the game.

426
00:24:54,229 --> 00:24:58,006
Rym: Also because overwatch is a limited number of players and it has set matches.

427
00:24:58,147 --> 00:25:06,450
Scott: There's a lot of reasons you know, and you look at say rocket league, it's like usually in rocket league, you'll self-organize, you know, someone will hang back and be the goalie, but nothing's stopped.

428
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,615
Scott: Everyone's just in a car.

429
00:25:07,977 --> 00:25:08,640
Scott: Everyone's equal.

430
00:25:08,701 --> 00:25:09,645
Scott: You can all do whatever.

431
00:25:09,766 --> 00:25:11,071
Scott: I'll go all over the field.

432
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:19,985
Scott: I think there really needs to be a development of some sort of game where it's like, you know, in the MOBAs, someone has to be the carry.

433
00:25:20,045 --> 00:25:25,413
Scott: Someone sorta has to, if you don't have, you know, but sort of the right, you can, everyone can go everywhere and do everything.

434
00:25:25,434 --> 00:25:28,407
Scott: The support in a MOBA can go away and destroy the base.

435
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:29,651
Scott: theoretically, right?

436
00:25:29,671 --> 00:25:33,728
Rym: Theoretically, like I have killed a lot of people as mercy in overwatch.

437
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:34,571
Scott: Sure, sure.

438
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,486
Scott: But what we need is we need someone to make some kind of game.

439
00:25:38,506 --> 00:25:45,210
Scott: I can't imagine what the game will be like where you literally must have, like we just talked about goalie.

440
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:50,767
Scott: Imagine some sort of FPS where it's a capture the flag game.

441
00:25:50,948 --> 00:25:52,533
Scott: I'm just, I'm just kind of with whatever right now.

442
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:53,437
Scott: Right.

443
00:25:53,457 --> 00:25:55,605
Scott: And not everyone can touch the flag.

444
00:25:55,625 --> 00:26:00,205
Scott: There's only one person has to be a flag carrier and all they can do is carry the flag.

445
00:26:00,366 --> 00:26:01,110
Scott: They can't even shoot.

446
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:06,210
Scott: That's obviously not going to be that fun a game, but you get the idea of like the route.

447
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:11,167
Scott: Now the game itself is such that you must have a person in these roles.

448
00:26:11,368 --> 00:26:11,930
Scott: Well, right.

449
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:18,186
Scott: When you sign into the game, there's going to be like a, um, you know, you know, you can, you're the, you can't go in that area if you're not the goalie.

450
00:26:18,227 --> 00:26:21,237
Scott: You can't look at literally cannot do this thing and let.

451
00:26:21,257 --> 00:26:24,048
Scott: your only one kind of role has guns.

452
00:26:24,109 --> 00:26:24,831
Scott: No one else has them.

453
00:26:24,851 --> 00:26:26,076
Rym: Let's look at like ice hockey.

454
00:26:26,497 --> 00:26:28,725
Rym: You could just have two left wings.

455
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:29,889
Scott: Sure.

456
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:30,893
Rym: If you wanted to.

457
00:26:30,913 --> 00:26:30,973
Rym: Yep.

458
00:26:31,475 --> 00:26:37,987
Rym: Because the probably because the human being that's playing left wing versus right wing versus center has a different set of skills and abilities.

459
00:26:38,007 --> 00:26:39,233
Scott: It's usually about their handedness.

460
00:26:39,795 --> 00:26:39,915
Scott: Right.

461
00:26:39,955 --> 00:26:40,999
Scott: Handed your left handed.

462
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:41,461
Scott: Right.

463
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:54,756
Rym: Also handedness is kind of messed up in the U S like I, I learned this from while I don't want to get into it now, but basically American street handedness and hockey differently from the rest of the world for weird reasons.

464
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:57,288
Rym: And I feel like that's a topic I want to bring up.

465
00:26:57,448 --> 00:26:59,744
Rym: I got to find a video on it and make it a thing of the day in the future.

466
00:26:59,764 --> 00:27:00,529
Rym: Cause I read about that.

467
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,513
Scott: I know about that as well.

468
00:27:02,175 --> 00:27:07,956
Rym: Uh, fun fact, I'm, I'm like hyper right-handed like I am right-handed to an extreme.

469
00:27:08,016 --> 00:27:12,800
Scott: All you gotta know is that if an American is right handed, they keep their right hand near the bottom of the hockey stick.

470
00:27:13,021 --> 00:27:18,912
Scott: Whereas if say a Canadian was right handed, they got their right hand at the top of the hockey stick and their left hand near the blade.

471
00:27:19,032 --> 00:27:25,173
Rym: So I was taught hockey left-handed because my, the people I played hockey with knew better.

472
00:27:25,635 --> 00:27:26,640
Rym: So I am right handed.

473
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:33,366
Rym: So when I was first handed a hockey stick as a kid, I was handed it and told to play left-handed and it made me way better.

474
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:36,603
Rym: I put my right hand, my right hands at the top, my left hands at the bottom.

475
00:27:36,623 --> 00:27:37,690
Scott: My right hand is near the blade.

476
00:27:38,071 --> 00:27:39,416
Scott: I guess American style.

477
00:27:39,456 --> 00:27:42,968
Rym: My left hand is near the blade and I'm right-handed anyway.

478
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:50,954
Rym: Anyway, so the, the roll lock thing that they did is going to make the sport more professional and probably save it.

479
00:27:51,577 --> 00:27:53,003
Rym: In my opinion, I may be wrong.

480
00:27:53,325 --> 00:27:55,153
Rym: I mean, it's hard to tell if it can be saved.

481
00:27:55,294 --> 00:27:55,515
Scott: Yep.

482
00:27:55,615 --> 00:27:56,338
Scott: It's not going to hurt.

483
00:27:56,419 --> 00:27:57,484
Rym: I think it can be saved.

484
00:27:57,524 --> 00:28:04,094
Rym: If any e-sport is going to be the most like legitimate and serious, I feel like the blizzard ones, blizzard is trying the hardest.

485
00:28:04,114 --> 00:28:08,372
Scott: Even if it fails, it probably isn't because of the e-sports things they're doing.

486
00:28:08,412 --> 00:28:11,506
Scott: It's just, you know, you got to have interest in your game.

487
00:28:11,707 --> 00:28:12,229
Scott: Exactly.

488
00:28:12,249 --> 00:28:12,470
Scott: Right.

489
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:18,057
Scott: It's like, yeah, even if you run your league a hundred percent correctly, it's like, well, people aren't interested in your game.

490
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:22,154
Rym: It's going to make regular play way better and bring people back into the game.

491
00:28:22,194 --> 00:28:30,686
Rym: because the way regular competitive play now works, if you do a roll lock, you'll have three different rankings for each of the roles.

492
00:28:31,107 --> 00:28:31,388
Rym: Okay.

493
00:28:31,629 --> 00:28:34,823
Rym: So if I join a game and I say, I'm a tank, I'll get a tank rating.

494
00:28:35,184 --> 00:28:39,667
Rym: Now the game's algorithms when they decide how good I actually am and how much I contribute to the team.

495
00:28:39,748 --> 00:28:42,358
Scott: It could be world champion tank rating and like nub.

496
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:50,311
Rym: But it means I could play competitive and decide I want to try being DPS and try to get better at DPS and it won't hurt my other ranks.

497
00:28:50,351 --> 00:28:50,954
Scott: That's real good.

498
00:28:51,335 --> 00:28:56,977
Rym: And if I suck at DPS, it'll put me in wood tier where I belong and I won't ruin anyone else's game.

499
00:28:57,037 --> 00:28:57,540
Scott: Also good.

500
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,002
Rym: Yeah.

501
00:28:58,323 --> 00:29:08,327
Scott: But also the only thing I can imagine this being a problem with is let's say everyone wants to be tanks and now you chose tank and you wait like an hour to get in a game because not enough.

502
00:29:08,388 --> 00:29:12,385
Scott: And meanwhile games aren't launching because no one wants to be, not a factor.

503
00:29:12,405 --> 00:29:13,811
Rym: The player base is broad enough.

504
00:29:14,213 --> 00:29:18,010
Scott: It is, but there could be, there's going to be a longer line in one of the categories.

505
00:29:19,152 --> 00:29:19,574
Rym: You know what?

506
00:29:19,935 --> 00:29:23,050
Rym: The categories have the longest line is DPS and those are the shittiest people.

507
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:25,237
Rym: So problem is going to self correct.

508
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:25,698
Scott: All right.

509
00:29:26,662 --> 00:29:29,454
Rym: But the separate ranking also means this is the important part.

510
00:29:29,474 --> 00:29:33,172
Rym: They haven't said much about this, the algorithm, because it's still a team game.

511
00:29:33,212 --> 00:29:43,688
Rym: Like I've been rated between low silver and like upper gold, low platinum, depending solely on who I happen to be matched with when I play games.

512
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:44,975
Rym: Because sometimes I get good teammates.

513
00:29:45,015 --> 00:29:46,222
Rym: Sometimes I get shitty teammates.

514
00:29:46,503 --> 00:29:47,429
Rym: Sometimes I get good comp.

515
00:29:47,449 --> 00:29:48,352
Rym: Sometimes I get bad comp.

516
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:54,615
Rym: But with this, the algorithms that determine your rank can take very specific factors into account.

517
00:29:54,655 --> 00:30:05,826
Rym: Like if you're playing tanks, it can look at how much damage you prevented being done to your team and use that to have a more nuanced approach to your skill ranking in terms of the team, even if the rest of your team sucks.

518
00:30:06,328 --> 00:30:07,634
Rym: There's no way to do that today.

519
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:11,008
Rym: And that's enough Overwatch talk because it's time for...

520
00:30:11,028 --> 00:30:12,796
Scott: I just want to briefly talk about this one thing.

521
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:13,660
Scott: Oh, what one thing?

522
00:30:13,961 --> 00:30:16,473
Scott: So we talked about 8BitDo a while ago.

523
00:30:16,493 --> 00:30:20,149
Scott: It's a company that makes third party game controllers that don't suck.

524
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:21,233
Scott: Oh yeah.

525
00:30:21,314 --> 00:30:21,816
Scott: I forgot about this.

526
00:30:21,836 --> 00:30:30,269
Scott: They made a thing, the adapter that lets you basically plug in the GameCube controllers wire into it, and it will wirelessly connect to a switch.

527
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,781
Scott: So you can play Smash with a GameCube controller.

528
00:30:32,821 --> 00:30:34,610
Scott: That's a wired controller, but you'll be wireless.

529
00:30:35,091 --> 00:30:35,974
Scott: I got one.

530
00:30:35,994 --> 00:30:37,318
Scott: I used it for Smash.

531
00:30:37,579 --> 00:30:38,081
Scott: It's great.

532
00:30:38,662 --> 00:30:42,153
Scott: I still use it if I smash, which is rarely, but I have it.

533
00:30:42,213 --> 00:30:42,534
Scott: It's good.

534
00:30:43,036 --> 00:30:52,993
Scott: So 8BitDo had this other controller called the SN30 Pro, and basically it was a Super Nintendo looking controller, but it had two analog sticks like PlayStation.

535
00:30:53,836 --> 00:30:54,198
Scott: All right.

536
00:30:54,298 --> 00:30:57,452
Scott: People know controller is pretty good, but people had some issues with it.

537
00:30:58,014 --> 00:31:06,723
Scott: I think there was a Kickstarter or whatever, but now there is an Amazon pre-order for this new controller, the 8BitDo SN30 Pro Plus.

538
00:31:07,364 --> 00:31:15,812
Scott: It's a Super Nintendo controller that also has two analog joysticks, two analog sticks where the PlayStation original PS one has them.

539
00:31:16,354 --> 00:31:19,687
Scott: It has, you know, the extra has two triggers on each side, not just one.

540
00:31:19,707 --> 00:31:22,518
Scott: And it has wing-a-lings like a PlayStation controller.

541
00:31:22,538 --> 00:31:27,874
Scott: And you can use this to connect to a switch, a PC, right?

542
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:29,219
Scott: A Raspberry Pi.

543
00:31:29,259 --> 00:31:31,265
Rym: This might be the one controller.

544
00:31:31,325 --> 00:31:33,030
Scott: Windows, OS X, or Android.

545
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,214
Scott: It doesn't connect to iOS.

546
00:31:34,274 --> 00:31:39,592
Scott: It connects to literally everything else except iOS and PlayStations and Xboxes.

547
00:31:41,034 --> 00:31:47,186
Scott: But yeah, Windows, Android, OS X, Steam, Switch, Raspberry Pi.

548
00:31:47,687 --> 00:31:51,037
Scott: It's like the be all end all controller.

549
00:31:51,057 --> 00:31:52,844
Scott: It seems to be.

550
00:31:52,864 --> 00:31:56,298
Scott: I'm going to wait for some more reviews of people actually got one in their hands.

551
00:31:56,358 --> 00:32:03,423
Scott: Some people did get them already before I decide, but I think if this controller is legit, it's only $50 per controller.

552
00:32:03,443 --> 00:32:07,316
Scott: The Switch Pro Controller costs a fortune.

553
00:32:07,356 --> 00:32:10,388
Scott: The new Xbox controller is a mega fortune, right?

554
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,640
Scott: PlayStation controllers, I think, are more or at least as expensive.

555
00:32:15,206 --> 00:32:20,388
Scott: So since I don't have an Xbox or a PlayStation, I think I might get rid of if this is a legit controller.

556
00:32:20,408 --> 00:32:23,463
Rym: I've already got four Xbox controllers that I used on the HDPC.

557
00:32:23,523 --> 00:32:27,999
Scott: I'm going to get one of these, and if it's legit, I'm going to dump my Xbox controllers.

558
00:32:28,521 --> 00:32:32,434
Scott: I'll even dump, I have real SNES and NES controllers like adapters.

559
00:32:32,595 --> 00:32:33,237
Rym: I have the same.

560
00:32:33,298 --> 00:32:34,121
Scott: I'll dump those.

561
00:32:34,402 --> 00:32:36,170
Scott: I won't even really need GameCube controllers.

562
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:36,832
Scott: It's not like...

563
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,200
Rym: I'm definitely getting rid of that garbage.

564
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,104
Rym: Steam controller.

565
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:40,995
Scott: Right, Steam controller gone.

566
00:32:41,015 --> 00:32:44,733
Scott: I'm going to get rid of every controller and just replace it with like two or three of these.

567
00:32:44,753 --> 00:32:45,716
Scott: The end.

568
00:32:46,057 --> 00:32:46,639
Scott: Forever.

569
00:32:47,643 --> 00:32:48,506
Scott: The perfect controller.

570
00:32:48,546 --> 00:32:50,232
Scott: So I'm hoping that it turns out to be true.

571
00:32:50,252 --> 00:32:58,058
Scott: I'm super glad that it's no longer the case as it was for my whole life that only first party controllers are worth a shit.

572
00:32:58,761 --> 00:33:02,474
Scott: And all third party was trash except for like the occasional fight stick.

573
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:07,332
Scott: Finally, 8BitDo coming through with the third party controllers that don't suck.

574
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:11,168
Scott: Hopefully, the verdict is not in yet, but it's looking promising.

575
00:33:11,569 --> 00:33:12,811
Rym: What a time to be alive.

576
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:13,272
Rym: That's right.

577
00:33:13,412 --> 00:33:21,380
Rym: But anyway, it is time for Things of the Day.

578
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,463
Rym: What do you got?

579
00:33:22,484 --> 00:33:30,094
Scott: So, Bruno Faidutti, I think that's how you pronounce his name, is the game designer who made the game, Citadels, among many other great games.

580
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:34,191
Rym: Ooh, I've been thinking about Citadels because of some stuff we might do at PAX Unplugged.

581
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:43,174
Scott: Anyway, Bruno Faidutti went to Tehran in Iran and checked out the board game scene in Iran.

582
00:33:43,194 --> 00:33:44,878
Rym: And it is lit.

583
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:48,150
Scott: Well, it's not 100% lit, but there's a lot going on there.

584
00:33:48,551 --> 00:33:49,535
Scott: It's kind of exciting.

585
00:33:49,556 --> 00:33:52,548
Scott: And he wrote a big ass article about it.

586
00:33:52,648 --> 00:33:56,182
Scott: And if you go look at the article, you'll say, "Hey, this isn't in English,

587
00:33:56,223 --> 00:33:56,785
Scott: goddammit.".

588
00:33:57,288 --> 00:33:59,479
Scott: Especially if you can't read it, I think it's French.

589
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:00,262
Rym: It looks like French.

590
00:34:01,026 --> 00:34:04,482
Scott: But if you scroll all the fucking way down, he wrote the whole article again in English.

591
00:34:04,723 --> 00:34:05,627
Scott: Thank Satan.

592
00:34:05,647 --> 00:34:08,982
Scott: The article's written twice on his blog, once in French, once in English.

593
00:34:09,303 --> 00:34:12,659
Scott: You can read all about what's going on in the board game scene in Tehran.

594
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:15,188
Scott: And it is fascinating, excellent read.

595
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:21,909
Scott: If you care anything about board games or the country of Iran or both, read this shit.

596
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:22,511
Rym: Yup.

597
00:34:23,393 --> 00:34:28,734
Rym: So my thing of the day, Hank Green, you know, the guy who does a lot of YouTube videos with his brother.

598
00:34:28,754 --> 00:34:29,458
Scott: Your favorite YouTube guy.

599
00:34:29,478 --> 00:34:30,525
Rym: Yeah, he's a pretty good guy.

600
00:34:30,545 --> 00:34:33,543
Rym: I used to be more a fan of John Green, but Hank Green has grown on me over time.

601
00:34:33,683 --> 00:34:33,924
Rym: Okay.

602
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:35,791
Rym: But this is special.

603
00:34:35,831 --> 00:34:40,145
Rym: He did this spinoff show called Journey Into the Microcosmos.

604
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:41,549
Rym: And holy shit.

605
00:34:41,609 --> 00:34:46,842
Rym: So basically, this is like the thing you should watch before you go to bed every night.

606
00:34:47,063 --> 00:35:02,929
Rym: It's basically really, really good microscopic video of tiny organisms and him very softly talking to you and explaining what the deal is with protozoa and like really excruciating detail.

607
00:35:03,411 --> 00:35:05,699
Rym: And it is terrifying and fascinating.

608
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:06,541
Rym: I've learned a ton.

609
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,471
Scott: Is this why you're scared of amoebas at the lake?

610
00:35:09,893 --> 00:35:15,539
Rym: No, I mentioned the amoebas at the lake because amoeba deaths have actually been on the rise due to global warming.

611
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,349
Scott: Yeah, but there are no amoeba deaths in New York yet.

612
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,857
Rym: Not yet, but they're coming north.

613
00:35:18,877 --> 00:35:19,882
Scott: I'm sure they are.

614
00:35:19,942 --> 00:35:21,047
Rym: They're coming north rapidly.

615
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:25,646
Rym: Basically, don't swim in freshwater lakes in the south without nose plugs.

616
00:35:25,867 --> 00:35:26,108
Rym: Yeah.

617
00:35:26,449 --> 00:35:28,838
Rym: And don't go to water parks in the south.

618
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:31,010
Scott: I mean, the amoebas can't live in the ocean, though, right?

619
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:31,231
Scott: Nope.

620
00:35:31,573 --> 00:35:33,001
Scott: And they can't live in a swimming pool.

621
00:35:33,784 --> 00:35:35,008
Rym: Not really good enough.

622
00:35:35,048 --> 00:35:36,032
Rym: Chlorine just kills them.

623
00:35:36,132 --> 00:35:36,413
Rym: Yeah.

624
00:35:36,473 --> 00:35:39,202
Scott: So it's basically fresh places.

625
00:35:39,282 --> 00:35:43,593
Rym: I swim shallow, warm, fresh water, mostly in the south.

626
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:44,115
Scott: Right.

627
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:55,275
Rym: But it is weird to watch a video that's just like this tiny little single celled organism, like having a fight with another single celled organism in semi real time.

628
00:35:55,656 --> 00:36:01,138
Rym: And you just get to watch it while Hank Green in a very soft voice just explains, like, what's going on?

629
00:36:01,198 --> 00:36:01,620
Rym: This stuff.

630
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:03,085
Rym: This is my jam.

631
00:36:03,426 --> 00:36:04,591
Rym: You just have to watch this.

632
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:09,710
Rym: And the one I'm going to link to is the one he waited to do until long after the show started.

633
00:36:10,372 --> 00:36:16,051
Rym: The best tiny organism, the smallest actual animal, the tardigrade, the snoot.

634
00:36:16,312 --> 00:36:19,745
Scott: Yeah, the water bears, the snoot, the tiny little bear looking guys.

635
00:36:19,765 --> 00:36:20,388
Scott: I know that guy.

636
00:36:20,508 --> 00:36:21,592
Rym: Yeah, that guy.

637
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:25,389
Rym: I learned I learned some crazy shit about this guy from this video.

638
00:36:25,771 --> 00:36:29,089
Scott: The thing is, I keep seeing pictures of that guy all over the place, but like a little guy.

639
00:36:29,209 --> 00:36:29,370
Scott: Yeah.

640
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,240
Scott: But where does it even like live everywhere?

641
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,544
Scott: Like is it went on me right now?

642
00:36:33,627 --> 00:36:39,993
Rym: They live in like tiny bits, like tiny films of water that are like just drops of water on plants.

643
00:36:40,113 --> 00:36:40,596
Rym: They're just there.

644
00:36:40,636 --> 00:36:41,420
Rym: They're all over the world.

645
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,128
Scott: They're everywhere on the whole earth.

646
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:43,531
Scott: Yeah.

647
00:36:43,571 --> 00:36:44,576
Rym: And they're basically invincible.

648
00:36:44,596 --> 00:36:45,219
Rym: Right.

649
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:45,661
Scott: Are they like?

650
00:36:45,762 --> 00:36:51,708
Rym: NASA sent a whole bunch of them into space on the outside of a research thing and they were fine when they came back.

651
00:36:51,969 --> 00:36:53,556
Scott: But it's like, are they on me right now?

652
00:36:53,576 --> 00:36:54,882
Rym: Uh, on you?

653
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:55,485
Rym: Probably not.

654
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:59,004
Scott: Are they the most, are there more of these than any other living organism on earth?

655
00:36:59,064 --> 00:36:59,486
Scott: Hell no.

656
00:36:59,547 --> 00:37:01,235
Scott: Are they like actually the number one guy?

657
00:37:01,275 --> 00:37:01,918
Scott: Hell no.

658
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,905
Scott: Who's the number one guy?

659
00:37:04,066 --> 00:37:04,868
Scott: Some kind of fungus?

660
00:37:05,229 --> 00:37:08,600
Rym: No, probably some sort of archivacteria, I guess.

661
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:16,065
Rym: I am might remember when we were not, when we were learning biology, there were still five kingdoms and everything was way different.

662
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:17,048
Scott: Yeah.

663
00:37:18,853 --> 00:37:23,956
Rym: Uh, some kid who lives in a rich school district and is in high school probably knows more about this than we do.

664
00:37:24,257 --> 00:37:24,700
Scott: Yeah, probably.

665
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:30,238
Rym: But these videos are really, really fascinating to watch in the meta moment.

666
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:35,279
Rym: The GeekNights book club book is the first novel, not the first book, but arguably the first novel.

667
00:37:36,141 --> 00:37:39,551
Scott: Actually the first novel ever written the tale of Genji.

668
00:37:40,795 --> 00:37:41,277
Scott: It's long.

669
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:42,943
Scott: I'm not going to get to it soon.

670
00:37:42,963 --> 00:37:45,133
Scott: When I do get to it, it'll take a while.

671
00:37:45,153 --> 00:37:46,218
Scott: That's okay.

672
00:37:46,238 --> 00:37:49,673
Scott: Cause we actually read the last book club book in a decent amount of time.

673
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:58,864
Rym: I'm currently reading a nonfiction book that's mostly focused so far on baseball teams a long time ago using particular kinds of grass to try to cheat.

674
00:37:59,325 --> 00:38:01,232
Rym: So it's good stuff.

675
00:38:01,392 --> 00:38:02,416
Scott: Relevant to our interests.

676
00:38:02,717 --> 00:38:07,973
Rym: Uh, we will be live in a month at the penny arcade expo.

677
00:38:08,133 --> 00:38:08,715
Rym: Oh my God.

678
00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:11,424
Scott: I booked my flight, but also summer is coming to a close.

679
00:38:11,806 --> 00:38:13,452
Rym: Basically convention season starts.

680
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:15,740
Rym: We're going to be at PAX west.

681
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,490
Rym: Then not too long after that PAX Unplugged.

682
00:38:18,771 --> 00:38:20,177
Rym: Not too long after that magfest.

683
00:38:20,378 --> 00:38:24,259
Rym: Then right after that we got PAX South and then PAX East is not that long after that.

684
00:38:24,279 --> 00:38:26,631
Rym: Cause it looks like PAX East is going to be early in 2020.

685
00:38:26,631 --> 00:38:28,259
Scott: Thank God it will be summer again.

686
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:28,961
Rym: Yup.

687
00:38:29,343 --> 00:38:31,291
Rym: So there's going to be a whirlwind convention season.

688
00:38:31,312 --> 00:38:33,160
Rym: You can see us on Friday or Saturday.

689
00:38:34,561 --> 00:38:38,497
Scott: It's like packs is coming up and I'm like, Oh no, no pegs do not come.

690
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:44,181
Scott: It will be the end of summer and beaches, but then I'll have paxes and hockey just until the next summer.

691
00:38:44,463 --> 00:38:44,764
Scott: Yup.

692
00:38:44,805 --> 00:38:47,499
Rym: And we upgraded the, uh, we had a lot more hockey games than we used to.

693
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:48,343
Scott: We got more people.

694
00:38:48,363 --> 00:38:52,723
Rym: So you got the same amount of hockey, but worst case scenario, I got all those games.

695
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:53,465
Scott: Okay.

696
00:38:53,505 --> 00:38:54,248
Rym: I'll pay for them all.

697
00:38:54,449 --> 00:38:54,890
Scott: Go ahead.

698
00:38:56,255 --> 00:38:57,801
Scott: Uh, so yeah, let's get right into it.

699
00:38:58,322 --> 00:39:00,310
Rym: Uh, we talk a lot about RPGs.

700
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:05,591
Rym: Like the first panel we ever did at a PAX was called beyond dungeons and dragons back in 2008.

701
00:39:05,591 --> 00:39:23,348
Rym: And the whole gist of that panel was guys, there are RPGs that are not dungeons and dragons or like dungeons and dragons in a different skin, like pathfinder or 20 star wars or whatever, or those garbage games like shadow run, which has never actually been a good game.

702
00:39:23,629 --> 00:39:29,834
Scott: Anyway, the point is we had a period of time where you played a lot of RPGs in college and shortly after college.

703
00:39:30,136 --> 00:39:33,231
Scott: And we still have a lot of people who are good to play with.

704
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:34,136
Scott: You don't have that problem.

705
00:39:34,176 --> 00:39:38,093
Scott: The problem we have is all the people are adults and you can't get time together.

706
00:39:38,133 --> 00:39:40,683
Scott: And RPGs usually take a significant time to play.

707
00:39:41,105 --> 00:39:47,489
Scott: They take the good ones often have a lot of rules to learn and investment and that those are our hurdles.

708
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:56,945
Scott: And this is, I think why people don't play tabletop RPGs in general and we'll even pay GMs to run games with them is because it's just such a to do to play an RPG.

709
00:39:57,006 --> 00:39:59,978
Rym: So, uh, actually there's another point there I want to make.

710
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:05,535
Rym: before we get in as a, as a reviewer, I can read the rules to a board game and review it.

711
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:13,520
Rym: But with RPGs, it's very hard to review an RPG without playing it a lot with a varied audience of people.

712
00:40:13,941 --> 00:40:21,531
Rym: So it's very hard to get to the point, even if I played a bunch of RPGs where I am comfortable passing some sort of judgment or reviewing it.

713
00:40:21,691 --> 00:40:21,872
Scott: Right.

714
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:23,860
Scott: I've got some RPGs on my shelf.

715
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,910
Scott: I've never played a lot of them, quite a few.

716
00:40:26,252 --> 00:40:34,193
Scott: And it's like, I would have to play one of those several times with several different groups because I might have a good review, but like, Oh no, that was the group or we played it wrong.

717
00:40:34,314 --> 00:40:37,451
Scott: Or, you know, I'd have to see like, what is this game really all about?

718
00:40:37,471 --> 00:40:38,356
Scott: It's such a thing.

719
00:40:38,376 --> 00:40:40,529
Rym: When you review a game, you gotta be able to say, who is this for?

720
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:41,435
Rym: Who is this not for?

721
00:40:41,455 --> 00:40:41,717
Rym: Right.

722
00:40:41,737 --> 00:40:45,142
Scott: You gotta get, you know, it's like, Oh, well that time that people didn't really learn the game when we played it.

723
00:40:45,182 --> 00:40:47,270
Scott: That time I played it with the experts.

724
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:50,946
Rym: We played the wizard's grimoire enough to give a real review of it.

725
00:40:50,966 --> 00:40:51,247
Scott: Right.

726
00:40:51,327 --> 00:41:00,949
Scott: So, uh, the wizard's grimoire is a game that I saw and it was like, Hey, get it on like itch IO for like a few dollar and you get all these other games in a big bundle that are all just PDFs.

727
00:41:01,331 --> 00:41:03,400
Scott: And I said, that sounds good to me.

728
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,369
Scott: Just a bunch of PDFs not going on my shelf.

729
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:07,098
Scott: Won't feel guilty if I don't play them.

730
00:41:07,179 --> 00:41:07,380
Scott: Right.

731
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,268
Scott: So paid the few dollars in itch IO.

732
00:41:10,388 --> 00:41:11,934
Scott: I downloaded a bundle of PDFs.

733
00:41:12,074 --> 00:41:14,283
Scott: I read the wizard's grimoire, the first one.

734
00:41:14,303 --> 00:41:26,656
Scott: Uh, I didn't read the other ones, but they're the similar, from what I can tell, uh, the barbarians bloody quest and all the other ones are basically the same mechanics, just with different, uh, you know, different setting, different character.

735
00:41:26,676 --> 00:41:35,688
Rym: Uh, and basically it's by Vincent Baker, who you may know from apocalypse world, kill puppies for Satan dogs in the vineyard.

736
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:36,833
Rym: in a wicked age.

737
00:41:37,054 --> 00:41:38,901
Rym: apocalypse world is what most people would know.

738
00:41:39,141 --> 00:41:39,342
Rym: Right.

739
00:41:39,783 --> 00:41:42,631
Scott: So, uh, puts out this game.

740
00:41:42,671 --> 00:41:43,975
Scott: It's a really brief game.

741
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:46,323
Scott: The PDF is like a handful of pages.

742
00:41:46,806 --> 00:41:49,057
Scott: Most of the pages you don't even have to read to play.

743
00:41:49,077 --> 00:41:51,467
Scott: You only have to read like two pages to play.

744
00:41:51,547 --> 00:41:57,367
Rym: In fact, you need to exercise the cell, the, like the force of will to not read everything.

745
00:41:57,447 --> 00:41:57,889
Scott: That's right.

746
00:41:58,209 --> 00:42:01,118
Scott: So the way it works is one per.

747
00:42:01,178 --> 00:42:02,562
Scott: it's a solo RPG.

748
00:42:02,843 --> 00:42:05,130
Scott: One person is the player.

749
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:15,138
Scott: And what you do in order to play the game is you need to find two, not one, not three, exactly two volunteers to play the game.

750
00:42:15,178 --> 00:42:17,025
Scott: Those players need those volunteers.

751
00:42:17,045 --> 00:42:17,647
Scott: They're not players.

752
00:42:18,028 --> 00:42:22,164
Scott: Those two volunteers need a no prior knowledge of the game whatsoever.

753
00:42:22,947 --> 00:42:25,074
Scott: Be no time commitment whatsoever.

754
00:42:25,114 --> 00:42:28,502
Scott: You can play for one minute or forever.

755
00:42:28,643 --> 00:42:28,844
Rym: Yep.

756
00:42:28,864 --> 00:42:30,913
Rym: Like basically any player can say, Nope, we're done.

757
00:42:31,435 --> 00:42:36,280
Scott: Any player, the player or any volunteer can just be like, that's it or done with this session and you can end it.

758
00:42:37,605 --> 00:42:38,929
Scott: I hit myself with the mic.

759
00:42:39,471 --> 00:42:40,675
Rym: I didn't even cause it this time.

760
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:47,660
Scott: You can end the game as abruptly as necessary at any time, whenever you want or have to or any doesn't matter.

761
00:42:47,841 --> 00:42:48,061
Scott: Right?

762
00:42:48,543 --> 00:42:51,572
Scott: It is the least investment imaginable.

763
00:42:51,632 --> 00:42:56,288
Scott: You can, if you're the player solo game, remember, you can just carry the game around with you.

764
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:02,654
Scott: And literally any brief moment that you have found two volunteers, you can play like you're on a train.

765
00:43:02,895 --> 00:43:08,917
Scott: You happen to two nerds having to sit near you or a better a nerd and like a random non nerd, right?

766
00:43:09,117 --> 00:43:10,583
Scott: You convince them to volunteer.

767
00:43:10,603 --> 00:43:11,768
Scott: They volunteer.

768
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,394
Scott: After five minutes, they're bored.

769
00:43:13,896 --> 00:43:14,338
Scott: You're done.

770
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:15,322
Scott: All right, you did it.

771
00:43:15,403 --> 00:43:15,644
Scott: Good.

772
00:43:15,905 --> 00:43:16,367
Scott: It's like now.

773
00:43:16,568 --> 00:43:18,558
Scott: literally is that easy to play this game.

774
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:32,896
Rym: I would be shocked if you ran into people who after five minutes were bored because what was fascinating about this both playing as a volunteer and by watching other people like play it and other people be volunteers is that it's real easy to get invested.

775
00:43:32,936 --> 00:43:41,883
Rym: Like the game, the simple bare minimum mechanics and the rules of how the story progresses really get people to be creative.

776
00:43:42,164 --> 00:43:45,277
Rym: And the fact that there are two volunteers is crucial to this.

777
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:46,301
Scott: So here's how it works.

778
00:43:46,743 --> 00:43:49,854
Scott: The player reads their little document and it tells a story.

779
00:43:49,915 --> 00:43:51,882
Scott: You are some kind of wizard.

780
00:43:51,902 --> 00:43:54,073
Scott: You build your stats with this system.

781
00:43:54,093 --> 00:43:56,363
Scott: You can change your stats every session if you want to go nuts.

782
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:56,845
Scott: Who cares?

783
00:43:57,427 --> 00:43:59,335
Scott: They don't progress or anything, right?

784
00:43:59,355 --> 00:44:04,475
Rym: So it was that the best of the two courts compiled her notes into a signature, right?

785
00:44:04,696 --> 00:44:06,122
Rym: Herself for travel, right?

786
00:44:06,142 --> 00:44:12,108
Scott: There's a story where somehow there was a magic book and you've got it and you don't understand shit in this magic book.

787
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:15,982
Scott: So you are going to try to learn what's in the magic book.

788
00:44:16,002 --> 00:44:23,566
Scott: And the magic book is the several last pages of the PDF and you only read sections of that book.

789
00:44:23,947 --> 00:44:29,768
Scott: that is literally given to you when you have achieved enough understanding via in-game mechanics.

790
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:36,395
Scott: And then with your self adult restraint, you only read one section of the book at a time when you're allowed to do so.

791
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:39,188
Scott: So I have only unlocked so far one section of the book.

792
00:44:39,248 --> 00:44:42,304
Scott: I haven't read sections two through X. I don't know how many sections there are.

793
00:44:42,324 --> 00:44:44,593
Scott: I only know what's in that first section.

794
00:44:45,175 --> 00:44:51,320
Scott: And the goal as the solo player is to play enough to have enough sessions that you can read the whole book.

795
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,786
Scott: But that's not actually your goal.

796
00:44:53,369 --> 00:45:02,698
Scott: Your actual goal, according to the rules, it says your goal as a player is to get in trouble and then get out of trouble, hopefully.

797
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:06,144
Rym: And that happened reliably.

798
00:45:06,365 --> 00:45:10,540
Scott: Every single time I played, I got in trouble and got out of trouble, right?

799
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,729
Scott: Now the volunteers, what are they all about?

800
00:45:12,789 --> 00:45:14,517
Scott: Well, here's how this game works.

801
00:45:14,637 --> 00:45:17,049
Scott: Ninety percent of the game does involves no dice.

802
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,818
Scott: When it does involve dice, it's a D6.

803
00:45:18,858 --> 00:45:20,325
Scott: But don't worry about that D6 right now.

804
00:45:21,048 --> 00:45:22,896
Scott: The way the game works is you are the player.

805
00:45:23,217 --> 00:45:25,408
Scott: You find two volunteers who are willing to volunteer.

806
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:30,775
Scott: They read some little tiny pieces of paper, which is like a whole page of the PDF, and it doesn't tell it in half.

807
00:45:31,157 --> 00:45:32,081
Scott: It doesn't tell much.

808
00:45:32,121 --> 00:45:32,763
Scott: Just tells them.

809
00:45:33,245 --> 00:45:35,392
Scott: the player is going to ask you questions.

810
00:45:35,773 --> 00:45:36,676
Scott: You answer them.

811
00:45:37,779 --> 00:45:44,076
Scott: Your goal as volunteers is to just answer the questions in the way that pleases you most.

812
00:45:44,638 --> 00:45:48,450
Scott: Entertain yourself with your answers to the questions.

813
00:45:49,253 --> 00:45:55,813
Scott: However, your answers to the questions only count and become real if both volunteers agree.

814
00:45:56,234 --> 00:45:57,398
Scott: Yes, that is the answer.

815
00:45:57,418 --> 00:45:58,843
Rym: That is the magic.

816
00:45:58,883 --> 00:46:00,490
Rym: That's the secret sauce.

817
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:01,856
Scott: That's the whole game, basically.

818
00:46:01,876 --> 00:46:03,764
Rym: Because if there's just one volunteer.

819
00:46:03,784 --> 00:46:05,189
Scott: It's stupid.

820
00:46:05,651 --> 00:46:06,514
Rym: It's boring.

821
00:46:06,554 --> 00:46:07,818
Rym: It doesn't go anywhere.

822
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:10,250
Scott: You don't have enough creative juice from one person and it can get stale.

823
00:46:10,591 --> 00:46:15,100
Rym: But two people, when I was playing with the other, I was one of the volunteers and we had another friend as a volunteer.

824
00:46:16,141 --> 00:46:18,132
Rym: He'd say something, I'd be like, "No, but what about...".

825
00:46:18,172 --> 00:46:22,650
Rym: And we really started bouncing off of each other in a hurry when we could veto each other.

826
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:24,074
Rym: It must be unanimous.

827
00:46:24,134 --> 00:46:28,998
Scott: You need two votes for anything to become a correct, true answer in the game.

828
00:46:29,018 --> 00:46:37,068
Rym: But the other magic sauce is that we can't just, we're constrained heavily by all we can actually do is answer questions that Scott asks us.

829
00:46:37,088 --> 00:46:37,450
Scott: That's right.

830
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:39,138
Scott: These volunteers, if they have any...

831
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:42,733
Rym: I can't just be like, "You are sitting in a cottage by the

832
00:46:42,773 --> 00:46:42,994
Rym: woods.".

833
00:46:43,115 --> 00:46:51,424
Scott: If these volunteers have any concept of normal, typical D&D-style RPGs with a GM, they feel like they're a team of GMs, right?

834
00:46:51,444 --> 00:46:53,372
Scott: Where they decide everything in the world.

835
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:54,919
Scott: It's like, "No, no, no.

836
00:46:54,959 --> 00:46:55,721
Scott: That's not what you

837
00:46:55,942 --> 00:46:56,123
Scott: are.".

838
00:46:56,343 --> 00:47:00,856
Scott: All you are is procedural generators of answers.

839
00:47:01,197 --> 00:47:03,365
Rym: It edges almost more into like, "Sleep is

840
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:03,786
Rym: death."

841
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:07,180
Rym: Except there's two people who have to agree on what happens.

842
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,806
Scott: So the player, right?

843
00:47:08,906 --> 00:47:11,637
Scott: They're really in control by asking the questions.

844
00:47:11,677 --> 00:47:15,093
Scott: They'll be like, you know, and sort of, you know, mostly in control, right?

845
00:47:15,113 --> 00:47:16,821
Scott: They'll be like, "What's the weather

846
00:47:16,881 --> 00:47:17,202
Scott: like?"

847
00:47:17,983 --> 00:47:18,244
Scott: Right?

848
00:47:18,605 --> 00:47:19,446
Scott: "What time is

849
00:47:19,567 --> 00:47:19,647
Scott: it?".

850
00:47:20,028 --> 00:47:21,030
Rym: Yup.

851
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,473
Scott: "Who knocked on my

852
00:47:22,513 --> 00:47:22,854
Scott: door?".

853
00:47:23,074 --> 00:47:23,235
Scott: Right.

854
00:47:23,255 --> 00:47:26,282
Scott: "I go into a town.

855
00:47:26,683 --> 00:47:27,706
Scott: What building do I

856
00:47:27,786 --> 00:47:28,047
Scott: see?".

857
00:47:28,328 --> 00:47:31,558
Scott: The volunteers might be like, "You don't see a

858
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:31,979
Scott: building.".

859
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:32,582
Scott: Right?

860
00:47:32,924 --> 00:47:33,869
Scott: "There are no buildings

861
00:47:33,929 --> 00:47:34,130
Scott: here.".

862
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:34,753
Scott: It's like, "All right,

863
00:47:34,794 --> 00:47:35,136
Scott: fine.".

864
00:47:35,176 --> 00:47:35,980
Scott: "I go into a tavern.

865
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:37,385
Scott: What does it smell like?

866
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:38,249
Scott: Who's here?

867
00:47:38,571 --> 00:47:40,097
Scott: Who's sitting at the table in the back

868
00:47:40,138 --> 00:47:40,459
Scott: corner?".

869
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:48,652
Scott: You can ask all kinds of leading questions, non-leading questions, and those volunteers have to answer all these questions or end the session, right?

870
00:47:49,194 --> 00:47:51,483
Scott: And that is what makes the things happen.

871
00:47:51,523 --> 00:47:53,048
Scott: Now, the dice, right?

872
00:47:53,108 --> 00:47:56,580
Scott: So, sometimes you want to do something, right?

873
00:47:57,161 --> 00:48:04,709
Scott: And you know, that you can't necessarily get done via asking questions, or there are questions that you can't really ask, right?

874
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:08,262
Scott: Like, if I'm just asking the questions, like, "What does the grimoire

875
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:08,563
Scott: mean?".

876
00:48:09,025 --> 00:48:10,289
Scott: Yeah, it's, "Ha, ha,

877
00:48:10,309 --> 00:48:10,349
Scott: ha."

878
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:10,650
Scott: Right?

879
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:14,061
Scott: "Oh, you met a large, mysterious man.

880
00:48:14,402 --> 00:48:15,767
Scott: Is this man planning to kill

881
00:48:15,807 --> 00:48:15,947
Scott: me?"

882
00:48:16,609 --> 00:48:16,950
Scott: Right?

883
00:48:17,412 --> 00:48:22,251
Scott: It's like, that's not something that you would be able to tell, like, how warm is it, right?

884
00:48:22,272 --> 00:48:24,823
Rym: Because if I got asked that question as a volunteer, you don't know.

885
00:48:25,044 --> 00:48:26,008
Rym: You can't read his face.

886
00:48:26,128 --> 00:48:26,550
Rym: Now what?

887
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:27,333
Scott: Right.

888
00:48:27,413 --> 00:48:42,969
Scott: So, what you do in those cases is you have your stats, and you roll one d6, and the way the system works is you pick the relevant stat, and if the d6 goes over the number, or that's sort of like equal or over, that's a failure.

889
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:46,302
Scott: You want to be as high as possible while being under.

890
00:48:46,583 --> 00:48:50,557
Scott: So if my stat is 4, I think maybe equal, oh, I forget, it doesn't matter, right?

891
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:57,985
Scott: You over is bad, I forget if equal is bad, but under is definitely a success, and you still want the number to be higher, right?

892
00:48:58,326 --> 00:49:21,560
Scott: So, if I'm doing, like, a, you know, test for stealthiness or whatever, subtlety, I forget what it's actually called, not looking at the PDF right now, you know, then I would roll, and if I got, like, a 3, and my stat was 4, it's like, all right, well, I can, you know, I, it was really good, I got, like, 3 opportunities to be stealthy or whatever, and it's probably going to be a successful endeavor, right?

893
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:30,002
Scott: The other thing that's really interesting is that there is an option to submit to circumstance, right?

894
00:49:30,263 --> 00:49:41,045
Scott: So, for example, in the third session where you weren't there, and I played, at one point, it's like, oh, you stumble into a bunch of cultists, and you weren't stealthy, and they saw you, and they caught you.

895
00:49:41,447 --> 00:49:44,118
Scott: It's like, I submit to circumstance, right?

896
00:49:44,499 --> 00:49:51,827
Scott: So I submit, and when you submit, it's the same system, but all the, as high as you get is the number of things you can keep.

897
00:49:52,288 --> 00:49:53,573
Scott: So you can choose, like,

898
00:49:53,774 --> 00:49:54,959
Rym: I keep my dignity,

899
00:49:55,099 --> 00:50:00,559
Scott: I keep my life, I keep my bearings, and it's like, all right, well, you lose, you lose, you

900
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:01,885
Rym: lose your clothes,

901
00:50:01,925 --> 00:50:02,367
Scott: you lose your

902
00:50:02,387 --> 00:50:03,472
Rym: stuff, and that sword,

903
00:50:03,492 --> 00:50:16,672
Scott: and you're right, it's like, you know, it's like that, basically, to prevent the volunteers, it's like, okay, you choose what you keep, you choose what you live, and then the book says, all right, the volunteers now tell you, you know, what happens next, right?

904
00:50:16,732 --> 00:50:26,310
Scott: It's like, there are instructions on each dice roll for the different, so, like, 6 or 7 different ways you can roll the dice on exactly what to do and exactly what the volunteers do.

905
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:45,637
Scott: So it's like, if you fail a certain thing, it's like, okay, you are unconscious, you are, you know, surprised or shocked, you're unconscious, you are then, you're snapped out of it by something the volunteers have to say what snaps you, you ask the volunteers, what snaps me out of it, right?

906
00:50:45,958 --> 00:50:47,485
Scott: And now they have to answer that question.

907
00:50:47,706 --> 00:50:56,726
Rym: And this leads to really fun interactions, like, at one point, Scott, I mean, one of the games we played, you basically did a thing that lets you know the mind of one of our NPCs.

908
00:50:56,747 --> 00:50:57,229
Scott: Right, right, right.

909
00:50:57,329 --> 00:51:06,829
Scott: It's like, when you roll the dice, it basically either allows you to ask questions, or forces you to ask certain questions, or it's always relating to the questions, right?

910
00:51:06,849 --> 00:51:13,817
Scott: It's like, well, now you have to ask this question, or you may now ask these three up to X questions you normally couldn't ask.

911
00:51:13,897 --> 00:51:17,169
Rym: Like, do these bandits actually plan to harm me?

912
00:51:17,289 --> 00:51:22,589
Rym: And then, as a volunteer, I gotta decide what the truth is there, and be truthful about it.

913
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:27,166
Scott: You could say yes or no, but you just, you have to answer my question, or stop the game.

914
00:51:27,948 --> 00:51:48,064
Rym: And there's some magic here, like, this concept is very powerful, and I was incredibly surprised at how easily, even, because, you know, when you try to get someone to play an RPG, even, like, what seems like a short, low investment one, like Ghost Court, sometimes people, like, aren't super enthusiastic, or, like, they're really hesitant.

915
00:51:48,566 --> 00:51:50,033
Rym: People who are even hesitant in this game.

916
00:51:50,053 --> 00:51:51,600
Scott: All you gotta do is answer questions.

917
00:51:52,060 --> 00:52:01,198
Scott: It's like, even someone who knows nothing about RPGs, it's like, all right, you know, it's like, every session starts with a sort of, like, a hook, right?

918
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:05,797
Scott: There's these little, like, tiny single paragraph, or even smaller hooks in the PDF.

919
00:52:05,837 --> 00:52:07,243
Scott: That's, like, a whole page, actually.

920
00:52:07,263 --> 00:52:07,725
Scott: Just hooks.

921
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:11,884
Scott: I've just been picking one and starting, but I guess you can make up your own hooks also.

922
00:52:12,426 --> 00:52:15,539
Scott: But you just pick a hook, and then start asking questions.

923
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,229
Scott: You read the hook, and start asking.

924
00:52:17,269 --> 00:52:19,059
Scott: And all the volunteers gotta do is answer.

925
00:52:19,099 --> 00:52:19,883
Scott: They don't gotta do nothing.

926
00:52:20,366 --> 00:52:20,507
Scott: Right?

927
00:52:20,547 --> 00:52:25,292
Scott: The player is the one who has to know at least a little bit about RPGs, but you don't gotta teach a volunteer shit.

928
00:52:25,353 --> 00:52:26,900
Scott: All they gotta do is answer questions.

929
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,329
Scott: You know, all right, what does the town look like?

930
00:52:30,369 --> 00:52:31,212
Scott: What time is it?

931
00:52:31,272 --> 00:52:33,962
Scott: What color is the bartender's skin?

932
00:52:34,002 --> 00:52:36,731
Scott: What are they selling in the shop?

933
00:52:36,932 --> 00:52:37,695
Scott: What's the price?

934
00:52:37,996 --> 00:52:40,966
Scott: And the thing is, you can't do anything but ask questions.

935
00:52:41,006 --> 00:52:43,516
Scott: So it's like, how much does the beer cost?

936
00:52:43,957 --> 00:52:44,660
Scott: A gold piece.

937
00:52:45,021 --> 00:52:46,544
Scott: How many gold do I have?

938
00:52:47,507 --> 00:52:48,710
Scott: Five gold pieces.

939
00:52:49,471 --> 00:52:50,734
Rym: I drink five beers.

940
00:52:51,496 --> 00:52:53,120
Scott: I offer the man a gold.

941
00:52:54,982 --> 00:52:55,945
Scott: How many gold do I have?

942
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:56,607
Scott: None.

943
00:52:57,229 --> 00:52:59,395
Scott: You don't have an inventory.

944
00:52:59,435 --> 00:53:00,699
Scott: You just ask questions.

945
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:09,553
Rym: The highest praise I can give is that in the game I was an assistant in, and then a game I watched, were radically different, and both really fun.

946
00:53:09,573 --> 00:53:11,220
Scott: Every game I played was radically different.

947
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:23,120
Scott: The volunteers basically, and it's who is playing, and the questions they ask, and who the volunteers are, and their mental state drives the game in a crazy different direction.

948
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:25,673
Rym: The first one was like, "Oh, these bandits actually aren't that

949
00:53:25,694 --> 00:53:26,096
Rym: bad.".

950
00:53:26,377 --> 00:53:28,727
Rym: And the second one was like, "Scott's erotic

951
00:53:28,787 --> 00:53:29,208
Rym: journey.".

952
00:53:29,489 --> 00:53:29,730
Scott: Yeah.

953
00:53:30,072 --> 00:53:37,557
Scott: And the third one I played, the two volunteers were seasoned D&D GMs who had, I imagine, little experience with other RPGs.

954
00:53:37,999 --> 00:53:40,389
Scott: And sure enough, it was a dungeon full of cultists.

955
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:43,983
Scott: And it's like, I guess that's the story you know how to tell.

956
00:53:44,505 --> 00:53:51,369
Rym: The most high praise I can give is that sitting next to a game of this, you really want to be able to answer questions.

957
00:53:51,409 --> 00:53:53,878
Rym: You want to be a volunteer, like badly.

958
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:58,776
Rym: It was really hard to not shut up when Scott and Kate were being your volunteer.

959
00:53:59,619 --> 00:54:00,844
Rym: I kept jumping in, and you were like,

960
00:54:00,864 --> 00:54:00,945
Rym: "Shh.".

961
00:54:01,507 --> 00:54:02,592
Scott: Yeah, I didn't ask you.

962
00:54:02,612 --> 00:54:04,742
Rym: Yeah, but I really wanted to answer.

963
00:54:04,762 --> 00:54:05,604
Rym: I had good ideas.

964
00:54:05,805 --> 00:54:06,246
Scott: Too bad.

965
00:54:07,069 --> 00:54:16,520
Rym: This game, the risk to you as a person who could play an RPG is so low, you should just get this game and make random people play it with you.

966
00:54:16,561 --> 00:54:24,897
Scott: Also, the stuff you need to play this game is you need the PDF, which you could put on a few pieces of paper, or just like your iPad or your phone, right?

967
00:54:25,118 --> 00:54:26,483
Scott: You need a single D6.

968
00:54:27,205 --> 00:54:29,312
Scott: You need nothing else.

969
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:32,382
Scott: I have been having a book and writing down everything that happens.

970
00:54:32,724 --> 00:54:35,674
Scott: That is not necessary or dictated or whatever.

971
00:54:35,694 --> 00:54:36,558
Rym: That's just fun.

972
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:40,896
Scott: You guess you could actually do an audio recording might be easier.

973
00:54:40,976 --> 00:54:45,799
Rym: I think we're going to try to play this game a few times and record it and see how that goes, maybe live stream it.

974
00:54:45,879 --> 00:54:46,080
Rym: Right,

975
00:54:46,160 --> 00:55:02,366
Scott: but the point is you need nothing, so you just bring a D6 with you everywhere you go and either a digital or physical copy of the PDF, and any time you're in a situation where you've got nothing to do for some minutes, even a few minutes, you know, maybe at least 10 minimum, right?

976
00:55:02,647 --> 00:55:03,670
Scott: Maximum hours.

977
00:55:04,091 --> 00:55:05,034
Scott: You got two people.

978
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:06,820
Scott: They're ready, willing, and able.

979
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:07,823
Scott: You play.

980
00:55:07,884 --> 00:55:08,668
Scott: It's your game.

981
00:55:08,829 --> 00:55:09,754
Scott: You carry it around with you.

982
00:55:09,774 --> 00:55:10,538
Scott: You're the player.

983
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:11,725
Scott: It's not like you have other, right?

984
00:55:12,046 --> 00:55:16,188
Scott: If other people want to play, they get their own PDF and start their own deal, right?

985
00:55:16,228 --> 00:55:18,860
Scott: Maybe you can volunteer for them too, but you know, it's your game.

986
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,884
Scott: You're playing solo.

987
00:55:20,165 --> 00:55:27,049
Scott: You just need volunteers to help you unlock the wizard's grimoire, and the other ones in the series appear to follow the same mechanics.

988
00:55:27,089 --> 00:55:33,133
Rym: I think I'm going to say Bloody Quest is the one I might just start playing.

989
00:55:33,274 --> 00:55:36,086
Scott: I looked at the PDF of the Barbarian's Bloody Quest briefly.

990
00:55:36,106 --> 00:55:42,549
Scott: It is basically the same game, only obviously you're unlocking not a wizard's grimoire, but something else.

991
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:46,305
Rym: You're Conan figuring out why the wizard killed everyone you've ever known.

992
00:55:46,405 --> 00:55:52,030
Scott: Right, and you know, you unlock pages in the PDF that you don't read at the start with your adult abilities.

993
00:55:52,371 --> 00:55:57,297
Scott: You have similar, you know, just different themes, but you still find two volunteers and ask them questions.

994
00:55:57,317 --> 00:56:08,261
Scott: That's the mechanic of the game, and you can make, I guess if you wanted to, there would be nothing stopping you from making more games using the two volunteer ask questions system, the wizard grimoire system.

995
00:56:08,642 --> 00:56:14,739
Scott: Just write up a new character, a new scenario, a new thing to unlock, right?

996
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:22,543
Scott: A new set of stats, a new character generation system for those stats, and a bunch of hooks, and that's all you need.

997
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:25,452
Scott: You can copy the volunteer page verbatim basically.

998
00:56:25,472 --> 00:56:37,327
Rym: So if you can, if there is anyone you want to be a celebrity guest on a live stream where Scott or I play these games, let us know.

999
00:56:37,588 --> 00:56:39,054
Rym: Like, I want to stream this game.

1000
00:56:39,094 --> 00:56:45,700
Rym: This game, of all the RPGs we could stream, this is the one that has the most potential to not be boring or procedural.

1001
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:46,743
Scott: It needs nothing, right?

1002
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:52,424
Scott: And also, if you don't have friends in person, like if you go on the internet.

1003
00:56:52,745 --> 00:56:55,296
Rym: Joe, you can play this on Discord with zero problems.

1004
00:56:55,316 --> 00:57:07,284
Scott: Go on a Discord and just find two freaking people who are on the Discord at that moment, who have it for a minute, send them a digital copy of the thing to read, the volunteer page, not the other pages.

1005
00:57:07,344 --> 00:57:10,704
Rym: You don't even need voice chat, you could do this over text, it would work fine.

1006
00:57:10,785 --> 00:57:17,994
Scott: You could just chat your questions, but voice chat is probably easier if you have speaking and hearing abilities, but if not, texting, texting, just fine.

1007
00:57:18,014 --> 00:57:25,220
Scott: You could even play this game slow rolling over email, email a question, then they email it back and forth.

1008
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,768
Rym: Yeah, you could play this game by mail.

1009
00:57:26,789 --> 00:57:27,995
Scott: You could do this, whatever.

1010
00:57:28,015 --> 00:57:35,657
Scott: This is the most flexible, least investment, highest payout RPG in maybe history.

1011
00:57:35,897 --> 00:57:36,840
Scott: A+ for this game.

1012
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:43,525
Rym: Yep, Vincent Baker is always standout, but this one, I feel like, this one has given me ideas I hadn't thought about.

1013
00:57:43,545 --> 00:57:52,235
Rym: Like, it pushed new ground that I had not considered in RPGs and is making me think about a later future of RPGs.

1014
00:57:52,455 --> 00:57:56,229
Scott: It's like, please be a computer for me in this game I am play.

1015
00:57:56,249 --> 00:58:03,974
Scott: That's why they're volunteers, they're just helping you play, you thank them profusely for their time and efforts.

1016
00:58:04,175 --> 00:58:08,275
Scott: Computers can do a lot in terms of... Doing what a computer should and possibly will do in the future.

1017
00:58:08,476 --> 00:58:15,248
Rym: But computers can do a lot in terms of procedural generation, but one thing they are not good at procedurally generating is stories.

1018
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:16,312
Scott: I've seen some.

1019
00:58:16,713 --> 00:58:17,696
Rym: Not good ones.

1020
00:58:17,897 --> 00:58:19,743
Scott: I've seen some machine learning pretty good stories.

1021
00:58:19,823 --> 00:58:23,134
Rym: Yeah, I have, but they're not interactive like this.

1022
00:58:23,977 --> 00:58:24,338
Scott: Anyway.

1023
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:26,183
Rym: This game is 100% worth playing.

1024
00:58:26,624 --> 00:58:27,085
Scott: Get this game.

1025
00:58:32,115 --> 00:58:34,379
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1026
00:58:34,399 --> 00:58:39,562
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1027
00:58:39,762 --> 00:58:44,780
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1028
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,733
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

00:58:47,894 --> 00:58:52,513
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1032
00:59:00,521 --> 00:59:03,442
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1033
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:21,772
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are... This is taking longer to load than usual.

1037
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:53,069
Rym: And now I leave you with something that I suspect you've forgotten if you've ever even encountered it.

1038
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:58,411
Scott: And I say, "Hey, yay, yay, yay, yay, hey, yay,

1039
00:59:58,491 --> 00:59:58,871
Scott: yay.".

1040
00:59:58,951 --> 01:00:00,791
Scott: I say, "Hey, what's it doing

1041
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:00,931
Scott: now?".

1042
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:47,063
Scott: And he tries.

1043
01:00:47,824 --> 01:00:49,786
Scott: "Oh my God, no, I try.

1044
01:00:50,988 --> 01:00:55,334
Scott: I try all the time in this

1045
01:00:55,574 --> 01:00:56,836
Scott: institution.".

1046
01:00:59,259 --> 01:01:00,741
Scott: And he tries.

1047
01:01:01,562 --> 01:01:03,624
Scott: "Oh my God, no, I

1048
01:01:04,545 --> 01:01:05,185
Scott: try.".

1049
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:22,119
Scott: And I say, "Hey, yay, yay, yay, yay, hey, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, hey, yay, yay, yay, hey, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay,

1050
01:01:22,139 --> 01:01:22,200
Scott: yay.".
