00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,397
Rym: It's Monday, May 2nd, 2016.

2
00:00:11,397 --> 00:00:12,740
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:17,170
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight building your own PC in.

4
00:00:20,111 --> 00:00:21,126
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:26,207
Rym: Yeah, sorry for the lack of GeekNights.

6
00:00:26,247 --> 00:00:32,151
Rym: right after PAX which suck is actually we had a lot of stuff to talk about Like we had a good Tuesday show coming up, but I got the flu.

7
00:00:32,894 --> 00:00:34,220
Rym: I'm just now almost.

8
00:00:34,984 --> 00:00:37,759
Scott: I will come back and make you get a second flu.

9
00:00:39,063 --> 00:00:49,037
Rym: It was a pretty bad flu But it the badness really only lasted one day and then there's just like two week Convalescence afterward and then when you get over the flu, I'm gonna come back with something I stole from CDC.

10
00:00:50,241 --> 00:00:53,813
Scott: Yeah, you know put in your food though.

11
00:00:54,175 --> 00:00:55,780
Rym: The more annoying thing was because I was sick.

12
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,200
Rym: I basically just stayed home and worked on GeekNights stuff.

13
00:00:58,702 --> 00:01:03,260
Rym: So I did upload a bunch of videos like that how to run an anime club panel and all that crap.

14
00:01:03,801 --> 00:01:12,640
Rym: But I also tried to upload a patreon thing and I was unable to and I have an open ticket with them and I'm really curious to see where this goes.

15
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:19,404
Rym: I think they're gonna need my help because I tried to upload an mp3 file as an attachment or For the embedded player.

16
00:01:19,505 --> 00:01:25,813
Rym: both options fail, but it only fails with one particular mp3 file.

17
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:36,087
Rym: that is not particularly different from any other mp3 file I've uploaded and it Specifically fails in a very specific 100% repeatable way.

18
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:41,388
Rym: yet other similar files do not fail and They seem to be stumped.

19
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,780
Rym: So I have an open ticket with them and it's interesting.

20
00:01:44,082 --> 00:01:46,900
Scott: Oh, I'm surprised that they actually like care and are looking at it.

21
00:01:46,984 --> 00:01:51,653
Rym: Oh, no I've gotten more tech support from patreon than I've gotten ever from I don't know.

22
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:57,580
Scott: Google Apple Intel combined It must be one of those stardom be places where like the people are working too hard.

23
00:01:57,761 --> 00:02:03,249
Rym: What's weird is I tweeted at them because I figured that's the kind of place where you know The only place to get a human is to tweet at them.

24
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:04,896
Rym: I didn't get a response there.

25
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:05,820
Rym: So I was like, huh?

26
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,522
Rym: That's weird.

27
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:10,239
Rym: This seems like a kind of company where someone's job is just like read Twitter all day.

28
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:14,051
Rym: So I go to the website like how do I actually get support?

29
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:19,719
Rym: because you know, it's interesting in the modern era You don't expect there to be a way to get support for most things.

30
00:02:20,443 --> 00:02:26,212
Rym: So like I go to the website and sure enough I could just open a ticket So I opened a ticket and it totally worked.

31
00:02:26,694 --> 00:02:27,760
Rym: I'm kind of shocked by that.

32
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:37,860
Scott: I'm trying to see if Spotify actually contacted Spotify support today and I'm curious if it works Right, because if you go on Spotify and you search for Captain Jack, there's actually two different Captain Jack's and one of them's fake.

33
00:02:38,226 --> 00:02:39,040
Scott: Well, it's not fake.

34
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,040
Scott: He's just some rapper who calls himself Captain Jack and there but he's mixed in with the good Captain Jack, right?

35
00:02:44,521 --> 00:02:45,860
Rym: You can't click on like the Creator.

36
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:54,264
Scott: I mean it is but that says it and the artist page is like there's two sets of albums and two different artists mixed together Name.

37
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:58,163
Scott: and then today I would search for BTS because they have a new album That's not on Spotify yet.

38
00:02:58,685 --> 00:03:00,650
Scott: And the first album wasn't their album.

39
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,395
Scott: It was some chiptunes album by a group.

40
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:08,074
Scott: I suppose is named BTS But I would assume then these all the regular BTS album.

41
00:03:08,114 --> 00:03:09,700
Scott: So I went and I was like, how do you fix this?

42
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,480
Scott: So they're like fill out this the support form on Spotify.

43
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:12,983
Scott: So I did.

44
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:15,416
Scott: I filled it out twice being like these are mixed together.

45
00:03:15,497 --> 00:03:17,220
Scott: These are mixed together So we'll see if they get unfixed.

46
00:03:17,421 --> 00:03:28,740
Rym: I wonder if there are musical artists who make names of songs and names of bands that are Designed to get confused with things where likely that won't be fixed trying to funnel people toward their crap.

47
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:34,059
Scott: Well, no the Captain Jack guy seems like he's an actual like musician, you know.

48
00:03:35,464 --> 00:03:42,107
Scott: And then BTS seems like an actual chiptunes album, it doesn't seem like some fake Oh album, but I'm glad you're defending Captain Jack cuz.

49
00:03:42,147 --> 00:03:43,231
Rym: I feel like no one else will.

50
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,619
Rym: Captain Jack is finally remembered at least by me.

51
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:53,779
Scott: You know many people remember Not as many as should not as many as should indeed but enough.

52
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:58,840
Rym: So do you have any news or do I need to provide you some news to talk about?

53
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,866
Scott: I don't think there's any news really there's a lot.

54
00:04:00,947 --> 00:04:02,391
Scott: There's not any technology news.

55
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:05,140
Scott: I mean, there's a lot of technology news.

56
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:05,904
Scott: It's all garbage.

57
00:04:06,306 --> 00:04:08,336
Rym: All right, so I got some news then.

58
00:04:08,356 --> 00:04:11,380
Rym: so This is an interesting article.

59
00:04:11,743 --> 00:04:13,399
Rym: It's one of those like UX teardowns.

60
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:37,599
Rym: It's a long long article with lots of screenshots and examples comparing Google Maps in 2010 to Google Maps in 2016 and what it's specifically comparing is what data and what density of data are shown at different zoom levels and the conclusion is Actually something that I've noticed but I really think about and as I was reading this I started thinking about this a lot.

61
00:04:38,163 --> 00:04:44,507
Rym: The conclusion is that in 2010 Google showed City names all over the place.

62
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:54,140
Rym: towns and cities were like like they were labeled all over the maps more like a traditional map But nowadays basically doesn't fucking show you any names of cities.

63
00:04:54,561 --> 00:05:01,800
Rym: It just shows the interstates and important roads and that's pretty much it unless you search for the name of a town.

64
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:09,268
Rym: now as I scrolled through this article I was thinking about it and I realized that this that One.

65
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:16,979
Rym: but the article is good But the conclusion that the person who wrote the article makes is basically old man yelling at cloud like just doesn't get it.

66
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:21,576
Rym: I'm sorry person who wrote this article and everyone who might be mad about this.

67
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:27,600
Rym: once you notice it The reason your town's name is not on Google Maps anymore is because no one cares about your town.

68
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:31,335
Rym: Like the names of towns are never useful.

69
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:39,268
Rym: when you're looking at Google Maps You need to see the roads because people really only use Google Maps at that zoom level When they're driving and looking at directions to get somewhere.

70
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:43,840
Rym: Google is primarily a navigational thing or a find a restaurant in the town.

71
00:05:43,941 --> 00:05:51,400
Rym: I'm in thing at this point and Google's UX is basically moved toward that end and it's actually a much cleaner better design.

72
00:05:51,440 --> 00:06:02,533
Rym: I pretty much disagree with every conclusion this article makes but The article is a really good place to see side by side the changes in Google's UI and it's actually a really really detailed article.

73
00:06:02,553 --> 00:06:08,346
Rym: I Was not just that.

74
00:06:08,407 --> 00:06:19,760
Rym: it's that in the old days if you just like say you just look at a town in Google or look at an area in Google You'd see like some of the interstates and you'd see like 10 or 15 towns like with little dots and their names next to them.

75
00:06:20,403 --> 00:06:22,855
Rym: Now you see almost no text at all.

76
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:29,896
Rym: It's just Interstates and a handful of cities like in New York don't I know but I don't care what.

77
00:06:30,136 --> 00:06:31,540
Rym: we don't care about UX at all.

78
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,371
Scott: I don't really give a shit information.

79
00:06:35,471 --> 00:06:37,600
Rym: You don't care at all about aesthetics or any of that stuff.

80
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:39,689
Scott: I do not care about this in any way.

81
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:41,920
Rym: You don't care if interfaces ever change or get better.

82
00:06:42,262 --> 00:06:44,458
Scott: I didn't even notice which is the best kind.

83
00:06:45,221 --> 00:06:47,160
Rym: Alright, well, I guess that's why you're not a UX designer.

84
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,146
Rym: so I had noticed this.

85
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:58,896
Rym: I noticed a lot of changes like this over the years and I know I found too that a lot of people seemed to be really mad about this and Most is one guy.

86
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:03,734
Rym: no So it's mostly the people who are mad about these changes seem to follow.

87
00:07:03,754 --> 00:07:05,620
Scott: the people are mad about change of every anything.

88
00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:07,198
Rym: They fall into a particular group.

89
00:07:07,782 --> 00:07:21,979
Rym: They're the same people who would for example rather than using their smartphone To just get directions when they go somewhere they print maps or directions from their desktop and then they take that into their car.

90
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:27,171
Rym: and most of these people seem to prefer Physical maps to Google Maps and are just dumb old people.

91
00:07:27,191 --> 00:07:29,420
Scott: that I did that back in the day when there were no phones.

92
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:30,303
Scott: Yeah, I did that.

93
00:07:30,364 --> 00:07:47,500
Rym: Well, this also it's interesting because these this change coincides pretty heavily with the fact that in the early days the vast majority of clients hitting Google Maps were desktop computers and Nowadays the far majority of the things ever hitting Google Maps are smartphones.

94
00:07:48,122 --> 00:07:52,119
Rym: so it's basically the design catering toward the need.

95
00:07:52,139 --> 00:08:00,000
Rym: and The problem is Google Maps is called Google Maps and it analogizes what we would think of as a map.

96
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:28,960
Rym: but yet most of the things that humans have used maps for up until recently are better served by things that don't really look recognizably like the maps that we used in the old days like Extra detail in a map is almost useless 99% of the time when you're using the map because you're almost always using the map only to Get to a specific point somewhere on that map And you're not particularly interested in like what the town next to the point you're getting to is named after.

97
00:08:29,604 --> 00:08:45,390
Rym: So all this means is that someone at Google has been consistently for years like Refining the interface of Google Maps and they've actually done a really good job of it and a lot of people like Scott just never Noticed how much better this interface has gotten over the years.

98
00:08:47,253 --> 00:08:50,350
Rym: All right, whatever all right, I guess you don't care about stuff.

99
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,172
Rym: Here's another one.

100
00:08:51,553 --> 00:08:56,425
Rym: Intel has decided that they're all but abandoning the PC business.

101
00:08:56,485 --> 00:09:11,120
Rym: They're they're gonna sideline their PC business not too far to say that they might give up on the PC business down the road and they're basically saying that mobile chips cloud server type stuff is all they care about.

102
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:15,850
Rym: that PCs Desktops that sort of thing is just not a market worth considering anymore.

103
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,138
Scott: I haven't read this news, but it feels like you're.

104
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:21,330
Scott: they also just feels like one of this news that you are greatly exaggerating.

105
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:23,898
Rym: Oh, well, they also just cut 12,000 jobs.

106
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,563
Scott: Well, that doesn't sound exaggerated at all.

107
00:09:26,064 --> 00:09:27,068
Scott: Yeah, that sounds 100% correct.

108
00:09:29,972 --> 00:09:32,640
Rym: The article here is actually on Intel's website.

109
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,185
Rym: This isn't just like some speculator.

110
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:35,610
Scott: No, I'm not saying it's speculatory.

111
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,099
Scott: I'm saying you were exaggerating the words that are on that page.

112
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,990
Scott: most likely just but no just based on how much I know you.

113
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:50,986
Rym: Well, you can read the article, but they are sidelining their PC business and Lining their CPU cooler business.

114
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:57,590
Rym: Yeah Sort of relevant because if you notice, you know I was thinking about buying a PC last year because I'm getting mines getting near the end.

115
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,721
Rym: that's kind of the point of the show tonight.

116
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:10,530
Rym: and The components I would put in that PC between a year ago and today like nothing better has come out Like there aren't better chips for PCs.

117
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:19,199
Rym: Intel's not releasing PC chips on nearly the scale that they used to Because they're not that much better than the previous ones.

118
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:25,650
Scott: Yeah since Moore's law died some years back It's pretty much just like your CPUs just as good as the previous one.

119
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:32,676
Scott: Only the GPUs keep sort of bumping and even then they're not bumping, you know as crazily as they used to right I mean the different used to be.

120
00:10:32,696 --> 00:10:34,969
Scott: there was a huge gap between one GPU and the next.

121
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:39,680
Scott: now There's still a good good gap yeah, but it's not enormous like it was before and CPUs.

122
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:46,602
Scott: the gap between like one CPU generation in the next in terms of Price performance whatever is not really that much.

123
00:10:46,622 --> 00:10:48,628
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna notice when you're using your computer now.

124
00:10:49,511 --> 00:10:52,570
Rym: All they said was they're basically sidelining the PC business.

125
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:57,970
Rym: My speculation is that they're going to down the road back away from the PC business.

126
00:10:58,911 --> 00:11:08,269
Rym: I don't know what that'll necessarily mean, but Increasingly people don't seem to use desktop computers unless they are like super professionals or gamers with VR.

127
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:13,749
Scott: I mean when the lat, you know, Apple's making their own CPU so they can they're okay if Intel goes away, right?

128
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:24,782
Scott: You know, they make that they're all for all their you know, iPods, iPhones They make the a7s whatever so they could easily just you know Use those fabs and their designers to make stuff to put in MacBooks.

129
00:11:24,822 --> 00:11:26,809
Scott: if Intel bits, you know stops doing.

130
00:11:26,849 --> 00:11:31,310
Scott: yeah PCs I mean AMD, I don't know if they'll stop or not, but they suck.

131
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:38,554
Scott: So, I mean if this doomsday that I think is still weighs off at you know, if it's even coming What's the ways off?

132
00:11:38,594 --> 00:11:39,737
Rym: and we've been we've been.

133
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:49,670
Scott: if there's doomsday comes we can just go on new egg and buy like five Of the last generation of chips or whatever and right and that way if you know, we things get too serious.

134
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,035
Scott: We're just one chip doesn't cut it.

135
00:11:51,075 --> 00:11:53,003
Scott: We can just go to two chip three chip four chip.

136
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:54,770
Scott: Yeah get better motherboards.

137
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,814
Rym: well, I guess that the.

138
00:11:55,934 --> 00:12:02,373
Rym: the interesting problem is just that the PC market shrunk and Meanwhile separately.

139
00:12:02,434 --> 00:12:08,730
Rym: there was a very narrow window at the end of the k6 era and the k7 era and then that window disappeared.

140
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:17,602
Rym: Where AMD was making chips that had comparable performance to Intel chips at a lower price there was competition for the desktop computing market.

141
00:12:18,183 --> 00:12:20,856
Rym: then AMD just shit the bed and Intel.

142
00:12:21,017 --> 00:12:21,765
Scott: Intel cheated.

143
00:12:21,785 --> 00:12:22,210
Scott: basically.

144
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:25,667
Rym: Well Intel cheated by having R&D.

145
00:12:25,687 --> 00:12:32,756
Scott: well No, if there's a lawsuit that Intel lost that was very much just like yeah, they cheated but yeah But they also just.

146
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:37,276
Rym: they could continuously done R&D and they were able to continue moving forward.

147
00:12:37,296 --> 00:12:45,025
Rym: it almost appears like just speculation that Intel wasn't pushing too hard until AMD competed with them and then they had to do something.

148
00:12:45,386 --> 00:12:46,550
Rym: but now there's no competition.

149
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:54,488
Scott: No, it's making desktop PC chips anymore like who's gonna compete with Intel because it tossed so much money to get into the business and to make the chips?

150
00:12:54,668 --> 00:12:57,810
Scott: and then How many of them are you gonna sell really to gamers?

151
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:03,434
Rym: yep, and maybe someone with a server farm and even gamers like a VR ready rig.

152
00:13:03,475 --> 00:13:08,959
Rym: if you built a reasonably fast PC in the last year or two All you need to do is upgrade the video card.

153
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:10,645
Rym: Like you don't need to buy anything else.

154
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:19,040
Rym: Not much has changed Things of the day.

155
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,127
Rym: So I don't have you watch this.

156
00:13:21,147 --> 00:13:22,392
Rym: Do you know about Abu Hajar?

157
00:13:22,413 --> 00:13:24,000
Scott: I have no clue what you're talking about.

158
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:30,963
Rym: So this was a YouTube video vice news thing that went viral, but basically Isis - soldiers.

159
00:13:31,605 --> 00:13:36,684
Rym: they often wear gopros and things to get all this video and that's how they make their ads like come join the Fight or whatever.

160
00:13:36,905 --> 00:13:39,559
Scott: Yeah that because when you see a video of that that makes me want to go.

161
00:13:40,802 --> 00:13:45,119
Scott: Well, they make it look all those and cool Those videos just gonna make everyone want to stay the fuck away.

162
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:49,080
Rym: No, those videos make really impressionable people who think that they can be a badass.

163
00:13:49,823 --> 00:13:51,227
Rym: They feel like who I could be.

164
00:13:51,268 --> 00:13:54,800
Scott: that isn't the world a better place if those people go there and the smart people leave there?

165
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:57,014
Rym: maybe but that's not the argument I want to have now.

166
00:13:57,598 --> 00:14:00,808
Rym: so A unit of Isis.

167
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:02,936
Rym: they died like they were defeated.

168
00:14:02,956 --> 00:14:03,599
Scott: That's how they do.

169
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:13,632
Rym: the footage from someone's GoPro was recovered and There's one Isis soldier in this unit Abu Hajar.

170
00:14:14,274 --> 00:14:16,300
Rym: and Abu Hajar is that guy.

171
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:18,772
Rym: Abu Hajar is a fuck-up.

172
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:22,847
Scott: So even among Isis people Among them he is that guy.

173
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:27,020
Rym: if you don't want to watch like for real video of these guys fighting someone made a compilation of.

174
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,423
Rym: Just every time someone's screaming at him and it's like he starts firing the machine gun and they're like Abu Hajar What the fuck.

175
00:14:33,443 --> 00:14:34,948
Rym: you're hitting us with the shell casings.

176
00:14:34,989 --> 00:14:38,000
Rym: move it over to the other side and Abu Hajar you're doing it again.

177
00:14:38,121 --> 00:14:39,086
Rym: Stop it at one point.

178
00:14:39,388 --> 00:14:41,540
Rym: He tries to shoot the machine gun because everyone's yelling at him.

179
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,030
Scott: why did it make him the machine gun guy?

180
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:53,630
Rym: so then he moves over and he's resting the machine gun a different way and he starts to fire it and then the front of it falls into the cabin and Starts ricocheting bullets all over inside.

181
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:56,604
Rym: and once again, the guy's like Abu Hajar WTF?

182
00:14:57,922 --> 00:15:00,380
Rym: Then later, they're like give me and they give him a rocket launcher instead.

183
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:02,480
Scott: What why would you give the rocket launcher to?

184
00:15:03,644 --> 00:15:04,899
Scott: Give Abu Hajar the knife.

185
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:08,471
Scott: So that is what you give him when a boo give him the pointy stick.

186
00:15:08,531 --> 00:15:18,340
Rym: at best when Abu Hajar has the RPG He not once but twice fires it but he aims it up and just before he fires it you see the guy go.

187
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:23,059
Rym: No, Abu Hajar and the exhaust blast comes into the cabin and burns them all.

188
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:30,542
Rym: so This article the reason I'm making it my thing of the day is that that kind of made the rounds and you know It's a thing.

189
00:15:30,622 --> 00:15:32,950
Rym: I saw someone already selling Abu Hajar t-shirts.

190
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,940
Scott: Yeah, and this is you know, this is why military training is a thing.

191
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:39,068
Rym: Yeah Like zones of fire and like like.

192
00:15:39,108 --> 00:15:45,371
Rym: at one point the guy who's yelling at him was like Abu Hajar cover me And the particular jar doesn't know what cover means.

193
00:15:45,491 --> 00:15:47,580
Scott: No, he's our probably murdered him.

194
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:49,205
Rym: So he did know.

195
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:58,580
Rym: but the guy who told him to cover him probably didn't know because the guy says Abu Hajar cover me Abu Hajar starts firing the shell casings start hitting that guy again.

196
00:15:58,942 --> 00:16:01,360
Rym: Cuz he probably didn't realize cover me means fire.

197
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:19,687
Rym: So what I'm linking to my actual thing of the day is a pretty interesting technical takedown of a military person explaining all the things Abu Hajar does wrong and like what specifically he was doing wrong and it's just a Everything really fascinating article.

198
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:26,759
Rym: It also shows you kind of like what like from a military only perspective Like how Isis fights how jokey they are.

199
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,682
Rym: Oh, look, here's the movies.

200
00:16:27,963 --> 00:16:29,086
Rym: see be careful of.

201
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:33,038
Rym: and then he's got the RPG and then see that that exhaust.

202
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:36,597
Rym: but do Good job, but you roasted us, too.

203
00:16:38,222 --> 00:16:39,754
Rym: What's wrong with you Abu Hajar?

204
00:16:39,774 --> 00:16:42,267
Rym: Okay So you got a thing of the day.

205
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:44,499
Scott: I do it's much better than your thing of the day.

206
00:16:44,981 --> 00:16:47,088
Scott: So, you know pop-up books are good.

207
00:16:47,349 --> 00:16:52,787
Scott: I have I have my Odyssey pop-up book, which is like the bell You throw the spike into the Cyclops.

208
00:16:52,988 --> 00:16:53,088
Rym: I.

209
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:54,031
Scott: it's such a good one.

210
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:55,115
Scott: That's the best part.

211
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,780
Rym: It's got moving spike action.

212
00:16:57,025 --> 00:16:57,599
Scott: Yeah, it's great.

213
00:16:58,862 --> 00:17:02,334
Scott: I see here in this YouTube video a pop-up book.

214
00:17:02,394 --> 00:17:06,709
Scott: That is maybe even better it Even though it's new style transformers.

215
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:16,420
Scott: It's still a transformers pop-up book and as you can imagine There's transforming action in this pop-up book and it is like holy shit level of popping up and booking.

216
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:27,199
Scott: So you don't need to buy this probably expensive pop-up book that will take up a lot of room in your place of living and not provide as much entertainment value because you can just watch this YouTube video and get the full experience.

217
00:17:27,219 --> 00:17:34,290
Scott: I feel like everyone go to like the Barnes & Noble near you and play with it and Then put it back on the shelf and go home.

218
00:17:34,451 --> 00:17:36,664
Rym: pop-up books are like wall Scrolls Like you're gonna have one.

219
00:17:36,784 --> 00:17:40,760
Rym: just have one and have the best one and don't have any more.

220
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,920
Scott: Should I sell my Odyssey one and get a transformers one?

221
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:43,523
Rym: I don't know.

222
00:17:43,543 --> 00:17:44,669
Rym: that Odyssey one is pretty good.

223
00:17:45,051 --> 00:17:46,900
Scott: And the Odyssey one is so much more rare, right?

224
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,187
Scott: Yeah, you can't find that shit.

225
00:17:48,449 --> 00:17:53,858
Rym: That was from that like artisanal pop-up book Mocha years ago years ago.

226
00:17:54,261 --> 00:17:59,040
Rym: So in the meta moment, the booklet book will be Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood.

227
00:17:59,201 --> 00:18:01,334
Scott: I meant to start reading it and I didn't.

228
00:18:01,355 --> 00:18:02,220
Rym: I meant to start reading it.

229
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,820
Rym: But now I'm halfway through the 12th book of the wheel.

230
00:18:03,981 --> 00:18:14,480
Scott: it is sitting is sitting there on my little nightstand getting ready to get read and then a One-punch man fell on top and then master Keaton found of it and then asteroid omnibus fell on top.

231
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:16,807
Scott: It's just like no help.

232
00:18:16,948 --> 00:18:17,289
Rym: I'm fine.

233
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,514
Scott: I'm just words.

234
00:18:18,594 --> 00:18:19,939
Scott: I cannot beat these mangas.

235
00:18:20,643 --> 00:18:23,878
Rym: It's fine because I made an accidental commitment and now I'm sticking to it.

236
00:18:25,161 --> 00:18:29,600
Rym: Me and Keheil are gonna do a wheel of time podcast at PAX Prime.

237
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,112
Scott: You're gonna spend PAX Prime time on it.

238
00:18:32,232 --> 00:18:33,760
Scott: podcasting about wheel of time.

239
00:18:33,942 --> 00:18:40,850
Rym: It won't take us more than an hour But we're just gonna talk about what happened to ran out or over these last Into the fantasy novels.

240
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,594
Scott: Well, you know what it is.

241
00:18:41,614 --> 00:18:42,620
Scott: have a nice fantasy novel.

242
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,412
Rym: Here's what I realized the because I've noticed whenever I tweet about the real time.

243
00:18:46,432 --> 00:18:48,660
Rym: There's a few people who like respond.

244
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:51,060
Rym: It's like us with the prince of nothing.

245
00:18:51,462 --> 00:18:54,776
Scott: Like if someone if I saw a tweet about prince of nothing, I would have to say something.

246
00:18:54,997 --> 00:18:55,339
Scott: That's it.

247
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,684
Scott: So about the gnosis.

248
00:18:56,945 --> 00:19:07,378
Rym: if you're thirsty for talking about your like long-running dense fantasy series That many people you can talk about it with who you haven't already talked about everything as heels red.

249
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:08,683
Scott: a prince of nothing I don't know.

250
00:19:08,703 --> 00:19:10,874
Rym: So I'm gonna find out if he's thirsty for that.

251
00:19:13,483 --> 00:19:22,740
Rym: as much as wheel it a burner burning wheel with My brain's getting messed up as much as the prince of nothing is very sort of Tolkien s deconstruction.

252
00:19:23,602 --> 00:19:25,507
Rym: It is also really wheel.

253
00:19:25,568 --> 00:19:35,720
Rym: a time II deconstruction wheel of time is closer to those books than you think Mmm, especially once you get into the weird stuff with the forsaken and compulsion and all that creepy stuff down the road.

254
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:38,776
Scott: Yeah, those guys are aliens who landed in a rocket.

255
00:19:39,318 --> 00:19:49,720
Rym: Yeah So, uh, yeah, otherwise we have no conventions Until Connecticut Connecticut in July panel submissions are open the form kind of sucks.

256
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,553
Scott: If you're on our staff, you have to fill out this form on the website.

257
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:54,441
Scott: Otherwise, it's gonna be yes It's got.

258
00:19:54,482 --> 00:19:56,209
Rym: I filled it out like four times.

259
00:19:56,289 --> 00:19:58,700
Rym: I can't tell if it works cuz it just like you got the error.

260
00:19:59,084 --> 00:19:59,468
Scott: It worked.

261
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:03,680
Rym: I get nothing If I hit submit it just goes back to itself again empty.

262
00:20:04,263 --> 00:20:06,357
Scott: Did you fill out every single field on the form?

263
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:08,907
Scott: I did Even the ones you think you don't to fill out.

264
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:15,093
Scott: I filled out every single field cuz there's a message that will tell you What like you messed up, but it's a hard to see message because the bad UI.

265
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,580
Rym: Yeah, I'll just keep filling it out.

266
00:20:16,661 --> 00:20:17,879
Rym: I'll just try a couple different ways.

267
00:20:18,242 --> 00:20:19,026
Rym: I'll try a different browser.

268
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:21,640
Scott: I'm gonna ask the guy to give me a list of everyone who filled it out.

269
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:23,537
Rym: Yeah, so stay tuned.

270
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:26,187
Rym: Connecticut We'll be there as always.

271
00:20:26,588 --> 00:20:30,499
Rym: but the website seven some trouble lately and I'd have no comment on that.

272
00:20:31,744 --> 00:20:33,300
Rym: Next after that, of course is PAX Prime.

273
00:20:34,421 --> 00:20:39,659
Rym: Don't worry packs tip badges supposedly will not go on sale for like another week or two.

274
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:41,309
Rym: So you got some time to relax.

275
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:42,858
Scott: PAX West it's changed his name.

276
00:20:43,965 --> 00:20:48,287
Scott: They're going on sale after the PAX South badges And so the PAX South badges.

277
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:51,760
Scott: the problem is I guess South and us, you know, they weren't selling.

278
00:20:51,961 --> 00:20:54,976
Scott: They're still selling out right, but they're not selling out in advance.

279
00:20:55,057 --> 00:20:59,100
Scott: like Robert Coon For example, there were no hoodies at PAX South right and why was that?

280
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:05,279
Scott: Well, cuz Robert Coo says, you know, I don't know how many people are actually coming to this PAX South But I know I'm gonna sell this many hoodies per person.

281
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,807
Scott: But you know, am I really?

282
00:21:07,888 --> 00:21:08,952
Scott: how many hoodies should I make?

283
00:21:09,012 --> 00:21:11,020
Scott: is it gonna be worth it to make hoodies for PAX South?

284
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:18,774
Scott: And if you noticed PAX South didn't have any hoodies and that's because there weren't yes to do the hoodies Far enough in advance of the packs.

285
00:21:19,096 --> 00:21:24,180
Scott: So he has to write So if everyone would have pre registered for the PAX South he might have made some yellow hoodies to everybody.

286
00:21:24,402 --> 00:21:32,000
Scott: Meanwhile, despite the ridiculous That's just one example of that right the more people pre-order in advance the better they can plan the convention in the better.

287
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,970
Rym: Well paxies, I mean it sells out immediately no matter what they know the crowd.

288
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,200
Rym: and despite that those hoodies sold out like Friday morning.

289
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:39,364
Scott: No, they sold out.

290
00:21:39,404 --> 00:21:40,849
Scott: I'm like Sunday or Saturday.

291
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,780
Rym: Yeah, they sold out of men's medium right away, and then you're fucked?

292
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:44,512
Scott: Oh, maybe.

293
00:21:44,573 --> 00:21:44,959
Scott: but anyway.

294
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:53,920
Scott: So, you know, he's basically said look we need people to pre-order the South badges far in advance Even though the demand is lower than for the other one.

295
00:21:54,141 --> 00:21:58,080
Scott: But the problem is he's offering big incentives for people who pre-order.

296
00:21:58,201 --> 00:22:07,920
Scott: So if you're thinking about going to PAX South next year And you're gonna pay for it and do it the normal way by buying a badge Buy your badge as soon as they go on sale and you're gonna get all these goodies.

297
00:22:08,563 --> 00:22:11,480
Scott: So why if you're gonna go why not buy the badge now and get the goodies?

298
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:14,720
Rym: Well, a lot of people don't know if they're gonna go and they decide later.

299
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:16,569
Scott: But have you buy now and get the goodies?

300
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:18,036
Scott: you can just you know, not go later.

301
00:22:18,961 --> 00:22:22,040
Rym: And the other thing is I as you know, I don't want goodies.

302
00:22:22,201 --> 00:22:23,640
Rym: I got enough things in my house.

303
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:29,291
Scott: One of the goodies is a. I don't want the goodies either but one of them is a custom Lanyard that you can't get any other way.

304
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:33,435
Scott: I've already got a nice fancy custom land I know but I'm just saying there's someone out there who wants that.

305
00:22:33,657 --> 00:22:37,879
Rym: true true but there is the fundamental problem that not that this is the topic of the show or anything.

306
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:39,904
Rym: but Pax East will sell out.

307
00:22:39,924 --> 00:22:44,923
Rym: they could probably sell up like a couple hundred thousand badges just because so many millions of people live within A drive.

308
00:22:44,984 --> 00:22:47,056
Scott: I think there's an interview once where he said he could sell 5x.

309
00:22:48,021 --> 00:22:51,760
Scott: I don't know about that, but you could definitely think he could could definitely sell 3x no matter what.

310
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,751
Scott: I think you could sell 5x or more or else I think is the borderline.

311
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,903
Rym: how many people are within a day's drive of Boston?

312
00:22:58,688 --> 00:23:02,825
Scott: it's I don't know how many of you know More than 20 million.

313
00:23:02,845 --> 00:23:03,989
Scott: I don't know how.

314
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:07,701
Scott: if that percentage would really hundreds of thousands of people come to the packs I think.

315
00:23:07,742 --> 00:23:10,011
Rym: so what percentage of people would like to go to a PAX?

316
00:23:10,071 --> 00:23:12,699
Rym: put that against the number of people within a day's drive of Boston.

317
00:23:13,221 --> 00:23:16,270
Rym: But Pax Prime while it's smaller has the.

318
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,536
Rym: it's the first one has the sort of international appeal.

319
00:23:18,576 --> 00:23:20,987
Rym: like all the people who fly Long-distances.

320
00:23:21,007 --> 00:23:24,486
Rym: they're gonna go to that one obviously So that one sells out no matter what.

321
00:23:24,948 --> 00:23:27,176
Rym: but who lives close to San Antonio?

322
00:23:27,297 --> 00:23:29,790
Rym: everyone who lives nearby Desert people.

323
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,259
Rym: Yeah, they all already go.

324
00:23:31,501 --> 00:23:35,020
Scott: I think there's people who don't know about it or don't go who probably should right?

325
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,321
Scott: It's like.

326
00:23:35,361 --> 00:23:39,300
Scott: I know this gamer isn't like Oklahoma cuz like a netrunner is seen there, and they don't go to PAX.

327
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:40,744
Rym: Oklahoma.

328
00:23:40,845 --> 00:23:45,940
Scott: to San Antonio is quite a trip though It's not any more of a trip than like to Boston.

329
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:50,280
Rym: But if you're gonna do a big trip you might as well go to the way bigger packs.

330
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:51,940
Scott: It's cheaper to go to San Antonio.

331
00:23:52,141 --> 00:23:54,319
Scott: It is cheaper to go to especially if you live in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

332
00:23:54,481 --> 00:23:57,120
Rym: It was cheaper to go to San Antonio for us, and we live in New York.

333
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,784
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

334
00:23:57,804 --> 00:23:59,032
Scott: so the Tulsa, Oklahoma people.

335
00:23:59,052 --> 00:24:02,007
Scott: if you're a gamer in Tulsa, Oklahoma Shouldn't you be going to PAX out?

336
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:07,979
Rym: ah but most gamers care about the expo hall nonsense And they can't that packs house doesn't have a lot of that going on.

337
00:24:09,001 --> 00:24:11,152
Scott: You know the expo hall at PAX South must be way cheap.

338
00:24:11,192 --> 00:24:12,177
Scott: We should get in on that.

339
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,340
Scott: yeah I don't know what we'll do in there, but we should do it.

340
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:19,040
Rym: We would just we would go in with a bunch of people and make the luxury box We just set in it like a table top.

341
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,755
Scott: We could do like the twitch booth where it says the luxury box for twitch.

342
00:24:22,157 --> 00:24:22,660
Rym: we could do that.

343
00:24:23,081 --> 00:24:28,040
Rym: We'd have to get some people in because I don't want to hire one of those companies that makes booths Scott the patreon money.

344
00:24:28,402 --> 00:24:30,240
Scott: Yeah, go use it for that everyone.

345
00:24:30,401 --> 00:24:31,324
Scott: It wouldn't be enough.

346
00:24:31,545 --> 00:24:32,509
Rym: everyone who's about?

347
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,320
Rym: I had the price sheet from the first two paxis.

348
00:24:35,882 --> 00:24:38,532
Rym: We could have bought a booth at those first two sure now.

349
00:24:38,572 --> 00:24:45,911
Scott: We can't no kidding The price for the space at PAX South we could probably afford.

350
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:49,223
Scott: it's probably thousands of dollars right especially for the small booth We're gonna get.

351
00:24:49,525 --> 00:24:52,400
Scott: but the price to make a booth like the twitch booth would be expensive.

352
00:24:52,581 --> 00:24:55,373
Rym: What how much it would cost to pay twitch just to put us in their lineup?

353
00:24:55,413 --> 00:24:56,398
Rym: That's how everyone else does it.

354
00:24:56,639 --> 00:24:56,940
Scott: is that how?

355
00:24:58,304 --> 00:24:59,820
Scott: You pay for time on that twitch couch.

356
00:25:00,503 --> 00:25:02,140
Rym: I mean, I bet they just give it to like their creators.

357
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:07,709
Rym: But I'm sure if we went that to them with like ten grand and we're like look Schedule us on this thing.

358
00:25:08,314 --> 00:25:09,100
Rym: Here's ten grand.

359
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,590
Scott: I wonder if you got ten grand don't use it on that.

360
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:15,366
Scott: and if you try to use it on that just let me know So I can murder you first.

361
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,236
Scott: Well, here's the problem doing that for us.

362
00:25:17,497 --> 00:25:18,080
Rym: Yeah ten grand.

363
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:27,280
Rym: We could do a lot better things with ten grand but in the advertising like eyeballs space ten grand for that It would be way cheap compared to other forms of that that would give you.

364
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,839
Scott: So it's such a bad return on eyeballs per dollar.

365
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:34,660
Rym: Could I give you less of a return than the people who pay for those panels at New York Comic Con that literally no one?

366
00:25:34,821 --> 00:25:35,088
Rym: goes to?

367
00:25:36,281 --> 00:25:37,245
Scott: No, but it would still be.

368
00:25:37,325 --> 00:25:45,638
Scott: you could get a ton of eyeballs for ten grand if we just bought like Google ads or something Project we could hire someone to design really nice ads and put them on project.

369
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:48,000
Rym: Wonderful Well, I did because I got a bunch of free money.

370
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:56,460
Rym: I did run a Google ad campaign once for one of our YouTube videos and It actually like drove a lot of eyeballs and a lot of ad revenue.

371
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:59,337
Scott: Yeah, we could make YouTube pre-roll ads and put them on YouTube.

372
00:25:59,578 --> 00:26:06,376
Rym: Yeah Anyway, so I've talked about this off and on but I'm pretty much I've got my rig together.

373
00:26:06,797 --> 00:26:14,096
Rym: and you know typically like in the old days We talked about building computers a lot more often than we do now because computers changed a lot more.

374
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:14,999
Scott: Well, that's true.

375
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:25,680
Rym: But also Well think about like to the year 98 through 2005 I pretty much always stayed abreast of like what was going on in computers because she was changing all the time.

376
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,180
Scott: Well, it's also a timing thing, right?

377
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:32,370
Scott: So because of the time of when we started GeekNights I think it's like there was a time early on.

378
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,598
Scott: we're like I got a new computer then you got a new one.

379
00:26:34,618 --> 00:26:39,094
Scott: then five Years passed then we both got new computers again, and there was also a period.

380
00:26:39,114 --> 00:26:41,362
Scott: we were like we moved and got HDPC.

381
00:26:41,423 --> 00:26:42,767
Scott: so he bought extra computers.

382
00:26:42,787 --> 00:26:43,369
Scott: true, right.

383
00:26:43,409 --> 00:26:48,085
Scott: and then you actually bought two computers because you bought the Mac Mini and then you said And then you bought another computer.

384
00:26:48,105 --> 00:26:50,713
Scott: so there was like a bunch of extra computer buying.

385
00:26:50,894 --> 00:26:56,340
Scott: but even though you know still It feel it feels like oh did we used to buy the computers more often?

386
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:56,641
Scott: It's like.

387
00:26:56,681 --> 00:27:02,080
Scott: no, I've consistently bought a new desktop computer pretty much every five four to six years.

388
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:06,112
Rym: I was about to say every year since 1998 99.

389
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:12,034
Rym: It's four to six years except except for the one time when it broke Yep, when my case seven eight hundred.

390
00:27:12,054 --> 00:27:13,280
Scott: Yeah, those AMD's broke.

391
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:23,580
Scott: So we bought more computers then but I bought another AMD about a Thunderbird gigahertz Mm-hmm, and that one broke actually later - yeah, but other you know, it's just like we bought computer, you know.

392
00:27:23,781 --> 00:27:25,972
Scott: So my computer is like only like three years old.

393
00:27:26,032 --> 00:27:26,635
Scott: I think I'm not.

394
00:27:26,655 --> 00:27:28,483
Rym: also in that era we bought.

395
00:27:28,523 --> 00:27:36,107
Rym: we both bought our first like for real laptops and upgraded them like once each and Now like I'm still using that same laptop.

396
00:27:36,328 --> 00:27:36,830
Scott: I'm using that.

397
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:39,740
Scott: I actually upgraded from the laptop to the iPad Pro.

398
00:27:40,022 --> 00:27:41,432
Rym: Yep, I'm gonna get the I haven't.

399
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:42,460
Scott: I haven't used the laptop.

400
00:27:42,902 --> 00:27:43,745
Scott: it's into the closet.

401
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:50,085
Rym: the problem is the iPad Pro can not replace my laptop because One I still haven't fully figured out.

402
00:27:50,146 --> 00:27:55,140
Rym: if there is a clicker situation to use the iPad Pro to present panels of pax's.

403
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:55,783
Scott: Yes, there is.

404
00:27:55,803 --> 00:27:56,547
Scott: you can use keynote.

405
00:27:57,029 --> 00:27:58,215
Rym: Yeah, I'm not using keynote.

406
00:27:58,316 --> 00:28:00,542
Scott: Well, then I Want to.

407
00:28:00,643 --> 00:28:03,219
Rym: I want to use the kind of clicker I use now.

408
00:28:03,621 --> 00:28:05,731
Rym: I don't know if there's a good way to plug something like that.

409
00:28:05,831 --> 00:28:10,720
Scott: or if you have if you have a clicker that is Effectively a Bluetooth keyboard then you could connect to it.

410
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:21,600
Scott: The iPad would think it is a Bluetooth keyboard and then you could use Google Drive and Google Drive would say oh you're pressing page Down next page problem - I can't run like audition and shit on iPad Pro like I can on my laptop.

411
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,466
Scott: You can use Premiere clip.

412
00:28:23,726 --> 00:28:25,913
Rym: That's not useful at all for me.

413
00:28:25,993 --> 00:28:28,100
Scott: It's actually pretty good, but it's yeah, it's not real for me.

414
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:36,092
Rym: Yeah, like it's so and there's no audition But there are audio recording type programs those they're like prelude and like all those things that lets you like Have to your workflow.

415
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:42,448
Scott: I found that For the workflows, you can do a full workflow on these things If you just don't care like.

416
00:28:42,468 --> 00:28:53,900
Scott: I used the lightroom one Yeah, and it's like yeah this stuff you can't do in the mobile lightroom as easily or as good But it's like if you really wanted to you could use lightroom mobile.

417
00:28:54,864 --> 00:28:56,220
Rym: Yeah, but lightroom is good example.

418
00:28:56,801 --> 00:29:03,860
Rym: If we had a if we had a more robust or less robust workflow for video then yeah, that stuff will work fine.

419
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:09,179
Rym: But our workflow is pretty much as professional as it can be without over investment.

420
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:12,893
Rym: and Those tools just would add time to know.

421
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:14,019
Scott: real, you know, you haven't used them.

422
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:15,563
Rym: I've tried them out.

423
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,512
Scott: Where you when did you try Premiere clip?

424
00:29:18,135 --> 00:29:19,140
Rym: Oh, no, I tried prelude.

425
00:29:19,743 --> 00:29:22,420
Scott: Oh, no, no, I'm talking about like, you know the mobile versions of the Adobe.

426
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,860
Rym: Yeah, I read what clip does because I was thinking I'm gonna buy that iPad Pro.

427
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,403
Rym: So I was like, huh?

428
00:29:26,423 --> 00:29:27,188
Rym: Maybe I'll use this.

429
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:32,439
Rym: my general feeling was I probably won't use it But also I can't place it five on my iPad Pro.

430
00:29:33,361 --> 00:29:35,991
Rym: So don't play war bits no, but I place it five.

431
00:29:36,011 --> 00:29:37,456
Rym: when I travel I play rocket League.

432
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:38,944
Rym: when I travel for work I like.

433
00:29:39,206 --> 00:29:40,295
Scott: when I try I just don't.

434
00:29:40,577 --> 00:29:43,220
Rym: next week I'm flying to Hong Kong and I'm gonna be in Australia for like a week.

435
00:29:43,562 --> 00:29:48,389
Rym: So in the evening if I'm in my hotel room for a few hours for go to bed I just want to play some rocket League.

436
00:29:48,409 --> 00:29:49,334
Scott: You gotta tell me what days.

437
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:50,580
Scott: so I know what days not to come here.

438
00:29:51,063 --> 00:29:52,692
Rym: Oh, yeah, I'm gone the next two weeks.

439
00:29:53,336 --> 00:29:55,098
Scott: Okay, so When are you leaving?

440
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:03,305
Rym: Tuesday, I'm flying - so I guess Monday if we wanted to we could do like one more show for like the next Tuesday Or over the weekend.

441
00:30:03,326 --> 00:30:05,214
Rym: We could do a bunch of shows and then you have two weeks off.

442
00:30:05,455 --> 00:30:05,797
Scott: We'll see.

443
00:30:05,817 --> 00:30:08,922
Rym: Tuesday I'm flying to Hong Kong Saturday.

444
00:30:09,002 --> 00:30:13,400
Rym: after that I'm flying to Sydney and I'll be in Sydney until Thursday and then Friday morning.

445
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:14,886
Rym: Then I'm flying back here.

446
00:30:14,927 --> 00:30:16,614
Rym: So I'll be home here Friday afternoon.

447
00:30:16,694 --> 00:30:17,317
Scott: It's gonna be great.

448
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,010
Rym: Yeah It'll be a little too cold for like beach time.

449
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,295
Rym: So I'm gonna go mountain biking instead.

450
00:30:22,335 --> 00:30:23,540
Scott: Hopefully it'll be warm here.

451
00:30:23,902 --> 00:30:25,047
Rym: Well now that I've done.

452
00:30:25,108 --> 00:30:32,680
Rym: now that I've like done some serious mountain biking in Australia I'm gonna do those courses again, and I'm gonna like try to beat times and like get some lap records and shit.

453
00:30:32,821 --> 00:30:34,090
Scott: So good luck with that.

454
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:40,992
Rym: I forgot how much I love mountain biking But I digress not talking about a laptop because I'm not gonna buy a new laptop ever.

455
00:30:41,332 --> 00:30:47,839
Rym: and if maybe the surface pro 6 That's when I feel like it'll be time to buy a new laptop.

456
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:55,140
Rym: But I'm gonna go through my full rig of what I would buy if I was building a computer literally today.

457
00:30:55,481 --> 00:30:59,680
Rym: I might change it a little bit before I actually buy it because I don't need to buy it I'm.

458
00:30:59,781 --> 00:31:02,855
Rym: it's not like times in the past where my computer is dying.

459
00:31:02,915 --> 00:31:05,840
Rym: Like the USBs failed I need to do computer quick to do GeekNights.

460
00:31:06,602 --> 00:31:07,260
Rym: Everything's fine.

461
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,899
Rym: So I'm actually in no rush so I can tweak this a little bit.

462
00:31:10,522 --> 00:31:14,760
Rym: But it basically gives me a chance to sort of go over all the things that actually have changed.

463
00:31:15,121 --> 00:31:15,884
Scott: What has changed?

464
00:31:15,904 --> 00:31:28,082
Rym: so the first the biggest things that changed is that like when you look at the motherboards one There's USB 3 and USB 3.1 and all that kind of new stuff that just isn't on my motherboard as USB 3 and it's like Years old.

465
00:31:28,785 --> 00:31:32,380
Rym: Yeah, my motherboard does not have USB 3 because USB 3 did not exist when I built this computer.

466
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,105
Scott: That's sort of necessary Us 3b.

467
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:39,015
Scott: USB 3 is actually kind of a big deal Like if I put my USB stick in the not USB 3 hole.

468
00:31:39,256 --> 00:31:39,960
Scott: Yeah, it's very sad.

469
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,825
Rym: DDR4 is a lot faster.

470
00:31:44,006 --> 00:31:45,069
Scott: Can you even notice though?

471
00:31:45,089 --> 00:31:46,935
Rym: Uh for certain kinds of things?

472
00:31:46,975 --> 00:31:47,938
Scott: I mean, I have 32 gigs of RAM.

473
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,664
Scott: It's like RAM is not an issue.

474
00:31:50,106 --> 00:31:51,230
Rym: amount of RAM doesn't matter.

475
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:56,509
Rym: But RAM speed can matter especially things like rendering Whatever because there's.

476
00:31:56,529 --> 00:32:03,020
Rym: there's a lot of effects in Premiere that Will calculate some massive stupid data set and they do it in your RAM.

477
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:07,177
Rym: So you need to have enough RAM to hold the whole thing until it finishes the calculation.

478
00:32:07,197 --> 00:32:07,559
Rym: Mm-hmm.

479
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,232
Rym: But there's SATA 6 instead of SATA 3 and I've talked about before.

480
00:32:13,272 --> 00:32:16,884
Scott: I'm not sure which SATA I have but I'm pretty sure it's Probably three.

481
00:32:16,904 --> 00:32:21,237
Rym: it doesn't really matter because only recent drives can actually use that stuff.

482
00:32:21,819 --> 00:32:21,939
Scott: Mm-hmm.

483
00:32:22,944 --> 00:32:25,320
Scott: I mean the speed of my SATA drives never been a problem.

484
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,764
Scott: They're already so fast.

485
00:32:26,865 --> 00:32:31,799
Rym: mine are not fast enough to do 4k video stuff as real-time as I'd like to.

486
00:32:32,821 --> 00:32:35,731
Rym: Especially you're doing the multi camera view in Premiere.

487
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:36,574
Rym: Like I cannot.

488
00:32:36,735 --> 00:32:43,936
Rym: I do not have enough bandwidth Power supplies and stuff is actually not changed that much which was interesting.

489
00:32:44,317 --> 00:32:45,662
Rym: firewires dead Of course.

490
00:32:45,682 --> 00:32:48,250
Scott: Yeah, my motherboards all actually still have firewire on them.

491
00:32:48,571 --> 00:32:51,280
Scott: Yeah, there's no more my desktop both have one firewire each.

492
00:32:52,823 --> 00:32:54,620
Rym: You EFI but that's been around for a while.

493
00:32:54,901 --> 00:33:04,050
Rym: My computer has that m.2 is probably the one you'll have to think about the most because now Basically when you build a computer Well, isn't the main advantage of it just space savings like now?

494
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:09,799
Scott: you can just put a hard drive on a tiny stick onto your Motherboard so m.2 in a way tiny computer also supports.

495
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:15,240
Scott: Instead of having like now you don't need like a power cable and a data cable and all this garbage to plug in.

496
00:33:16,443 --> 00:33:23,920
Rym: Also, there's different kinds of SSDs now and basically you can and this used to only be the realm of like ultra servers.

497
00:33:24,321 --> 00:33:35,820
Rym: but SSDs can connect via say two three or say two six or PCI Express bus, why would you put a whole SSD into your PCI Express slot?

498
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:40,495
Rym: So people are doing high-end video workflows often do because they have plenty of PCI Express slots.

499
00:33:40,696 --> 00:33:41,960
Scott: is but I mean, is it really faster?

500
00:33:42,101 --> 00:33:53,887
Rym: Yes, 32 gigabit per second If you get a high-end SSD which we'll talk about SSDs in a minute because one of the side things has changed is that Not all SSDs are made like.

501
00:33:53,927 --> 00:33:55,412
Rym: they're not all the same guys.

502
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:58,140
Scott: Yeah, there's cheap ones now, but this they're not as good.

503
00:33:58,301 --> 00:34:04,557
Rym: Yeah, like you're in fact the lower-end SSDs you're almost better off getting a high-end spinning disk for how badly they perform.

504
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:11,719
Rym: but So you don't put these things unless like you're crazy in like your x16 slots or your video cards.

505
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:13,547
Scott: go No, cuz we're you gonna put your video card.

506
00:34:13,726 --> 00:34:16,559
Scott: Yeah, actually, can you put your video if you're not doing the SLI?

507
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:23,540
Scott: Can you actually use that second slot of PCI x16 for a hard drive or you have to put it in the regular PCI Express slot?

508
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,686
Scott: There's a normal sky.

509
00:34:24,706 --> 00:34:27,260
Rym: So it's just using the protocol.

510
00:34:27,922 --> 00:34:34,956
Rym: so basically like the motherboard I got if you look at it the m.2 slot is Technically an x4 PCI Express.

511
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:36,679
Scott: Oh, really?

512
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:47,219
Rym: So if you put an m2 drive that supports SATA or not say that supports PCI Express access because it's high-performance drive It'll be wicked fast

513
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,704
Scott: Mmm,

514
00:34:48,724 --> 00:34:53,158
Rym: so basically now if you're not gonna put like if you're building a relatively small computer if

515
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:55,618
Scott: you're building a pewter That doesn't need a giant video card in it.

516
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,954
Scott: Yeah get m2 and they'll be the tiniest computer in the universe and a crazy fast even it.

517
00:35:00,094 --> 00:35:03,510
Rym: m2 goes into the m2 slot It doesn't take up and your PCI Express.

518
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,100
Rym: You can still put a giant video card in there.

519
00:35:05,582 --> 00:35:08,212
Scott: Yeah, no, but I'm saying like you get your computer could just be so small though.

520
00:35:08,292 --> 00:35:10,240
Rym: Oh, yeah, you can make the tiniest of computer.

521
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:17,061
Rym: So what I'm pairing this with and that's where it gets interesting is because a lot of people asked why I'm getting two SSDs.

522
00:35:17,222 --> 00:35:18,025
Scott: I have two SSDs.

523
00:35:18,226 --> 00:35:18,447
Rym: Yep.

524
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:19,171
Rym: I've.

525
00:35:19,191 --> 00:35:20,336
Rym: right now I have three.

526
00:35:20,436 --> 00:35:23,863
Scott: I could probably do three But so I'm.

527
00:35:23,903 --> 00:35:30,523
Rym: my main hard drive now is this Samsung SSD and it's so is mine 350 bucks.

528
00:35:30,563 --> 00:35:33,393
Scott: I don't know if mine was 350, but it was.

529
00:35:33,573 --> 00:35:34,998
Scott: it was hundreds cuz it was really big.

530
00:35:35,038 --> 00:35:36,944
Scott: at the time It was like one of the biggest ones you could get.

531
00:35:36,965 --> 00:35:40,817
Rym: Oh Scott my 30 gigabyte SSD that I bought in 2009 was like 400 bucks.

532
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,575
Scott: Yeah, mine was like I think it's a 256 and it was less than that.

533
00:35:45,635 --> 00:35:46,298
Scott: But still it was.

534
00:35:46,499 --> 00:35:46,720
Scott: yeah.

535
00:35:47,122 --> 00:35:50,660
Scott: So I think at the time I bought it you could only get a 512 and if that was a fortune.

536
00:35:50,841 --> 00:35:53,711
Rym: So so I got two SSDs here and then the thing with the SSDs?

537
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:56,701
Scott: is that the good name brand that looks like the one I have?

538
00:35:56,761 --> 00:36:01,580
Rym: yeah that cost more like benchmarks show they perform so much better.

539
00:36:02,102 --> 00:36:05,600
Rym: Don't even bother with those cheap SSDs like they're not great.

540
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:12,964
Scott: Yeah I mean You know there's a lot of Advertising there that like seems fake because it looks like the same kind of marketing you would see for something like monster cable Which is just bullshit.

541
00:36:13,024 --> 00:36:19,160
Scott: right where people are like, oh, these are so much faster than those, you know It's the same garbage you see on all the packaging for these things.

542
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,480
Scott: But like for example, I have these Patriot USB sticks.

543
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:27,577
Scott: It's just a USB stick and they're like on the advertising like so much faster than your other USB sticks.

544
00:36:27,617 --> 00:36:28,340
Scott: and you think really?

545
00:36:28,741 --> 00:36:30,840
Scott: USB stick speed that's what we're getting into now.

546
00:36:30,943 --> 00:36:35,940
Scott: But no This USB sticks the Patriot ones like the USB 3 blue ones that I have.

547
00:36:36,382 --> 00:36:39,860
Scott: They are so much faster than every other USB stick I have.

548
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:45,867
Rym: Well this array of cards that I've got like these all perform differently Like I have a new the newer SATA drive.

549
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:48,233
Scott: the newer SSD I have compared to the older one.

550
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:50,379
Scott: I have is so much faster.

551
00:36:51,641 --> 00:36:56,019
Rym: So, but anyway, so I'm getting the Samsung 850 Evo which is like a state of three like standard SSD.

552
00:36:57,662 --> 00:36:59,027
Rym: It's 500 gigs, which is plenty.

553
00:36:59,047 --> 00:37:01,155
Scott: That's plenty for your pure OS and your apps.

554
00:37:01,235 --> 00:37:02,520
Rym: No, that's not for OS and apps.

555
00:37:02,621 --> 00:37:05,018
Rym: So that is my backup SSD.

556
00:37:05,702 --> 00:37:10,140
Rym: The only thing that's going there is when Scott gives me all the video and all the stuff from panels.

557
00:37:10,502 --> 00:37:11,970
Rym: Everything I'm working on goes on that drive.

558
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,900
Scott: Yeah, that's what I put on my secondary drive.

559
00:37:14,241 --> 00:37:17,193
Scott: So that's your secondary drive, but that's good enough to be a primary drive.

560
00:37:17,213 --> 00:37:17,795
Scott: What's the primary?

561
00:37:17,815 --> 00:37:19,140
Rym: Yeah, so that's the secondary drive.

562
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,623
Rym: It's right now.

563
00:37:19,663 --> 00:37:19,985
Rym: It's like 175 bucks.

564
00:37:20,006 --> 00:37:21,374
Rym: Oh, man, that's hella cheap.

565
00:37:22,461 --> 00:37:27,637
Rym: Yeah, it is because now you can get a 500 gig SSD for like 70 bucks.

566
00:37:27,757 --> 00:37:28,560
Scott: That's probably garbage.

567
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,216
Scott: It's definitely garbage, but what specifically about it is garbage?

568
00:37:33,256 --> 00:37:34,220
Scott: besides just being slower?

569
00:37:34,942 --> 00:37:40,840
Rym: It's just that it's slower and theoretically less reliable, but I based that solely on new egg reviews.

570
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:47,912
Scott: There are a lot of reliability issues, right people don't understand how SSDs work and how flash flash works But the thing is like name brands like.

571
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,500
Rym: I actually trust Samsung a lot.

572
00:37:49,842 --> 00:37:53,100
Scott: Samsung has one of like the best flash factories like on earth.

573
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:56,570
Scott: Yeah And it's telling surprised like how much flash stuff in general.

574
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:59,720
Scott: like you what do you think your iPhone has a flat has flash storage?

575
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,788
Scott: And who do you think makes that?

576
00:38:00,848 --> 00:38:01,433
Scott: it ain't Apple.

577
00:38:01,837 --> 00:38:09,560
Rym: So The part of the reason why I chose this particular one is my backup SSD is one It's the right size like the one terabyte one is just way too expensive.

578
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:16,938
Rym: 250 gigs isn't big enough, but it's got a 5 a full 5-bag review still despite almost 600 reviews.

579
00:38:18,502 --> 00:38:21,252
Rym: That says a lot because new egg people are not kind.

580
00:38:21,613 --> 00:38:24,914
Scott: no when this is a bad product in new egg You'll see it has like no eggs.

581
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:31,214
Rym: Yep Now sometimes you buy the no egg product anyway But you know what you're getting into like when you buy those Rosewill firewire chips or whatever.

582
00:38:31,716 --> 00:38:32,720
Scott: Rosewill is new egg brand.

583
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,623
Scott: It's actually pretty good.

584
00:38:33,764 --> 00:38:34,587
Rym: It's pretty good.

585
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:38,380
Rym: Except their firewire chips are some of the worst firewire chips in the world.

586
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:41,672
Scott: I've never tried a Rosewill firewire chip, but I Rosewill keyboard.

587
00:38:41,692 --> 00:38:42,154
Scott: That's really good.

588
00:38:42,355 --> 00:38:43,700
Scott: Oh, yeah, they're fine cherry chips.

589
00:38:43,720 --> 00:39:00,980
Rym: Yeah, so my main drive is a Samsung 950 Pro m.2 512 gigabyte PCI Express card To or PCI Express em - well, it's m2 form factor PCI Express protocol.

590
00:39:01,442 --> 00:39:05,720
Rym: Okay, m2 is just the form factor that you plug into the motherboard with it.

591
00:39:06,142 --> 00:39:07,870
Scott: Stick it like I thought it goes horizontal.

592
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:10,060
Scott: Do you put it in a PCI Express lot sticking straight up?

593
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,230
Rym: No, no, it goes flat like like.

594
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,718
Rym: basically there's a slot on the side.

595
00:39:13,778 --> 00:39:14,160
Scott: Is it good?

596
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,689
Scott: It's just a PCI Express lot.

597
00:39:15,931 --> 00:39:17,260
Rym: No, they don't m2 slot.

598
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,210
Rym: Okay, yeah, express is just a bus protocol.

599
00:39:20,531 --> 00:39:22,740
Rym: All right, so it just uses that protocol.

600
00:39:22,941 --> 00:39:25,471
Rym: It's on that bus, but you literally for m.2.

601
00:39:25,732 --> 00:39:30,259
Rym: You just slide it in sideways Parallel to the plane of the motherboard itself.

602
00:39:31,041 --> 00:39:34,275
Rym: It's like a RAM stick except the bits are on the end and the OS just sees.

603
00:39:34,315 --> 00:39:35,500
Scott: this is just like any other hard drive.

604
00:39:35,701 --> 00:39:47,819
Rym: Yes, so pretty much if you're building a super fast computer these days you get a super fast awesome m.2 Hard drive that looks like a RAM stick and just stick it into the motherboard and install windows on that.

605
00:39:48,241 --> 00:39:49,587
Scott: Okay, holy shit.

606
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:51,938
Rym: Does this thing look fast from the benchmarks and everything?

607
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:52,379
Rym: I've looked there.

608
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,444
Scott: It's like it looks fast.

609
00:39:53,464 --> 00:39:55,171
Scott: this piece of this piece of silica.

610
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:55,853
Rym: Yeah.

611
00:39:55,913 --> 00:39:57,560
Scott: No, but I mean circuit board looks real fast.

612
00:39:57,621 --> 00:39:58,540
Scott: It's just sitting there on the table.

613
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,720
Rym: Wow, that's actually does like looking at pictures of it compared to pictures of like similar drives.

614
00:40:03,302 --> 00:40:11,856
Rym: Now some motherboards got some lightning bolts on it some LEDs blinking some motherboards Daddy to m.2 slops, but I felt like that was overboard.

615
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,020
Rym: I am not.

616
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,773
Rym: I'm not doing any raid or any crap like that.

617
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:16,517
Rym: I've got one 512 SS.

618
00:40:17,361 --> 00:40:19,368
Scott: Oh, what's the price of this compared to the one you just said?

619
00:40:19,428 --> 00:40:20,352
Rym: three hundred and fifty?

620
00:40:20,592 --> 00:40:21,536
Scott: and what's the sizes?

621
00:40:21,797 --> 00:40:22,600
Rym: five hundred and twelve?

622
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,423
Rym: Gig both of them.

623
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:30,746
Scott: Oh, so it cost twice as much because twice as much it appears to be more than twice as fast I wouldn't get with that pricing.

624
00:40:30,847 --> 00:40:33,154
Scott: I wouldn't get two of the m2 ones unless I was hella rich.

625
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:35,567
Rym: exactly see cuz even though I've got money.

626
00:40:35,628 --> 00:40:37,839
Rym: I'm not gonna waste money I don't need that.

627
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:43,448
Scott: Yeah, dude, if I won the lottery and had hundreds of million dollars and lived on the beach I would still frugally buy a PC.

628
00:40:43,709 --> 00:40:50,518
Rym: Yeah, if I had millions of dollars the only difference between the computer I'm showing I would drive a GTR though and the computer of about I would actually buy.

629
00:40:50,558 --> 00:40:56,158
Rym: then If I had millions of dollars, I would buy like some ridiculous oxygen card for my video editing.

630
00:40:57,323 --> 00:40:59,611
Scott: But I'm not an oxygen card early, you know, what are the?

631
00:40:59,631 --> 00:41:02,020
Rym: what are those like fancy render cards like quadros?

632
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,176
Scott: I guess I would just get the Nvidia Titan.

633
00:41:04,357 --> 00:41:11,970
Rym: Yeah But I would get a render specific amazing card and I'd have a separate gaming PC But that's if I had ridiculous stupid money, which video?

634
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:12,633
Scott: titans?

635
00:41:12,894 --> 00:41:26,880
Rym: titans two of them but yeah, so I The gist of all this is that you can now build a computer where disk I/O is basically not a bottleneck anymore Which is kind of amazing.

636
00:41:27,483 --> 00:41:31,459
Scott: This hasn't been a bottleneck for me since you know, sa ta SSDs not sa?

637
00:41:31,479 --> 00:41:33,267
Rym: ta But it's a bottleneck.

638
00:41:33,308 --> 00:41:38,560
Rym: if you've got multiple 4k and 1080p videos You're trying to watch them all at the same time in a multi-camera monitor.

639
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:45,754
Scott: Actually, you know Even though my computer is like way way fast The thing that really kills me the 4k video is just playing it like VLC.

640
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:52,376
Scott: just playing it like it'll be fully loaded But if you'll see is just like, uh, there's so many pixels to draw every frame.

641
00:41:52,656 --> 00:41:53,198
Rym: What do you got?

642
00:41:53,218 --> 00:41:56,041
Rym: a 780?

643
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:57,065
Scott: The GPU is a 680.

644
00:41:57,065 --> 00:41:59,132
Scott: Oh and the CPU is like i7.

645
00:41:59,954 --> 00:42:00,617
Scott: That's really fast.

646
00:42:00,657 --> 00:42:01,259
Rym: So it's interesting.

647
00:42:01,299 --> 00:42:02,462
Rym: I have a 770.

648
00:42:02,462 --> 00:42:08,824
Rym: I can play 4k video just fine in VLC, but I cannot play it fine in Premiere.

649
00:42:09,166 --> 00:42:11,540
Scott: Oh premieres actually better at it than I found then.

650
00:42:12,401 --> 00:42:14,371
Scott: But that's I think what it is in VLC.

651
00:42:14,411 --> 00:42:17,635
Scott: The problem is when I try to full-screen it and premiere I'm never full screening the 4k video.

652
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:18,905
Rym: Yeah, but in Premiere.

653
00:42:18,965 --> 00:42:20,775
Rym: I can only play it if I down res.

654
00:42:20,815 --> 00:42:23,952
Rym: it's like, you know The 4x or the 8x like the bad view?

655
00:42:23,972 --> 00:42:24,737
Scott: I never.

656
00:42:24,757 --> 00:42:31,356
Rym: I don't do that But I was literally my disk IO maxes out when I hit play.

657
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:32,700
Rym: That's just cuz my computer's so old.

658
00:42:33,742 --> 00:42:46,999
Rym: So I bet you can tell that I whenever I buy a new computer The things I spend the most money on are the things that are like a current plateau of amazing performance while simultaneously Are hitting my biggest pain point with my current PC.

659
00:42:47,684 --> 00:42:53,015
Rym: I'm willing to spend a lot to avoid the problems I have today and I'm not gonna spend money on stuff that I already like if I don't like.

660
00:42:53,075 --> 00:42:58,676
Rym: I don't notice a problem With my CPU speed so I'm not gonna spend a ton of money to try to get more like.

661
00:42:58,696 --> 00:43:02,458
Rym: I'm not gonna overclock Because my CPU is not significantly limiting me.

662
00:43:03,401 --> 00:43:05,571
Rym: So, let's see the problem with CPUs.

663
00:43:06,114 --> 00:43:11,993
Rym: So I'm gonna get the core i7 6700 K Skylake whatever for core for it doesn't come with a cooling.

664
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,160
Rym: It does not come with the cooler.

665
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,440
Rym: I had to do the most research to figure out like what coolers are good.

666
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,811
Rym: I've never bought an aftermarket cooler in my life because they were always stupid.

667
00:43:22,313 --> 00:43:30,960
Rym: But now you pretty much have to and I think the best one to get for me is the NZXT kraken.

668
00:43:31,704 --> 00:43:32,467
Scott: What the hell is that?

669
00:43:32,749 --> 00:43:33,492
Rym: So remember it's.

670
00:43:33,714 --> 00:43:34,920
Rym: it's kind of like what we're looking at at PAX.

671
00:43:35,361 --> 00:43:38,548
Scott: This is the same thing that that advertisement worked on you at PAX.

672
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:45,042
Rym: Yeah, so yeah kind of I Advertised.

673
00:43:45,062 --> 00:43:47,051
Scott: next time you say advertising doesn't work on people.

674
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:49,080
Scott: I'll just be like well that booth on PAX worked at you.

675
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,392
Rym: Ah, but I'll tell I'll explain at least why it was.

676
00:43:51,432 --> 00:43:52,840
Rym: it's not just like oh I saw it and it's good.

677
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:54,153
Rym: I actually have some reasons why.

678
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:54,820
Rym: because I did.

679
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:57,108
Scott: Everyone justifies things after the fact.

680
00:43:57,128 --> 00:43:58,172
Scott: that's how thing humans work.

681
00:43:58,252 --> 00:44:00,580
Rym: now because I actually went and looked at a lot of other cases.

682
00:44:00,661 --> 00:44:05,648
Rym: I went to the dealers room a couple times and That was actually the best case at PAX.

683
00:44:05,929 --> 00:44:13,300
Rym: everything else either had things that you would complain about You know stupid fancy crap or whatever or they were just like weird foreign factors.

684
00:44:13,822 --> 00:44:18,580
Scott: The only cases I saw at PAX I liked for the small ones for like those that tiny computer we saw.

685
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:19,643
Rym: Oh, yeah, but that's different.

686
00:44:19,663 --> 00:44:20,607
Scott: Yeah, but what it mean?

687
00:44:20,968 --> 00:44:33,794
Scott: every which every case that was on display was a gamery, you know You know like You know the kind of you know looked of like spinning rims kind of stuff Yeah, which doesn't bother me, but this was probably the most tasteful case there.

688
00:44:33,814 --> 00:44:36,526
Scott: I mean, it wasn't the worst I've seen but it was bad.

689
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:37,975
Rym: I don't know why you think it was bad.

690
00:44:37,995 --> 00:44:38,920
Rym: I think it actually is elegant.

691
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,900
Rym: It has a like 60s kitchen aesthetic that I kind of like.

692
00:44:43,641 --> 00:44:44,787
Scott: Yeah, okay.

693
00:44:45,008 --> 00:44:50,290
Scott: Sure if you think so, it definitely has a Teenager with too much money's bedroom aesthetic.

694
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:53,120
Rym: I think how is like an off-white?

695
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,180
Rym: enamel looking thing with a single red stripe.

696
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,967
Scott: I had like a window on the side.

697
00:44:58,047 --> 00:45:01,319
Rym: every case has a window on the side and a cyber shape to it.

698
00:45:01,902 --> 00:45:02,344
Rym: What do you think?

699
00:45:02,444 --> 00:45:03,610
Rym: cyber shape what the?

700
00:45:04,373 --> 00:45:05,820
Rym: I can show you a case where I'd say?

701
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,188
Rym: Yeah, that has a cyber shape.

702
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:11,403
Rym: this case has like 60 Kitchen.

703
00:45:11,463 --> 00:45:14,360
Scott: just because you're spinning rims are less spinning doesn't mean they're not spinning.

704
00:45:14,561 --> 00:45:18,803
Rym: But I looked at a lot of cases at PAX and I feel like that one was the best one I saw.

705
00:45:18,843 --> 00:45:20,555
Rym: that was that was actually a mid tower.

706
00:45:20,616 --> 00:45:28,757
Rym: It wasn't the worst I gotta say didn't have like weird crap Like it didn't have any stuff built into it for like ridiculous liquid cooling nonsense that I don't want.

707
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:29,380
Scott: That's true.

708
00:45:30,401 --> 00:45:34,519
Rym: And I went back over there and I put dry put drives into it and took drives out of it.

709
00:45:35,444 --> 00:45:38,823
Rym: It was the best putting drives in and taking drives out experience I've ever had.

710
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:40,271
Scott: I love how you take that in consideration.

711
00:45:40,311 --> 00:45:41,740
Scott: a thing that you're gonna do like twice.

712
00:45:42,046 --> 00:45:44,411
Rym: Yeah Cuz you know what every has to be.

713
00:45:44,431 --> 00:45:50,018
Rym: this thing I do twice has to be a great Experience because I'll do it a third time toward the end of the computer's life.

714
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:59,238
Rym: when I go Ah, this m.2 is really cutting it anymore I'm gonna open it up and add some say to 50 drives to it And then I remember how much of pain in the ass it is.

715
00:46:00,281 --> 00:46:02,480
Rym: But the drives just not really well is really nice.

716
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:11,351
Rym: But more importantly remember that TED talk about if you have a lot of options and they're all mostly the same The best thing is to go with whatever you just touched or like.

717
00:46:11,371 --> 00:46:13,318
Rym: just pick one randomly doesn't matter.

718
00:46:13,338 --> 00:46:18,080
Scott: case I mean, you know the case matters and you're building it and it matters for cooling and keeping dust out.

719
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:24,233
Scott: But after that if you don't look at it and it's you know Yeah, Rym, I guess is gonna look at his a lot cuz he likes his spinner.

720
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:25,880
Rym: My case is like buried inside.

721
00:46:26,841 --> 00:46:29,230
Rym: It's only sticking out now because it overheats a little bit.

722
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:31,760
Scott: Yeah, it has a bunch of LEDs in it that are all blazing.

723
00:46:32,244 --> 00:46:33,719
Rym: That's because those are the cheapest fans.

724
00:46:35,242 --> 00:46:37,040
Rym: Also, I don't know why the LEDs bother you.

725
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:40,774
Rym: I don't know why you care so much about what someone else is wearing.

726
00:46:41,456 --> 00:46:44,167
Rym: I'm just saying like I Just seems over this fashion.

727
00:46:44,187 --> 00:46:46,075
Scott: I'm not getting any dumb LEDs in my computer.

728
00:46:46,316 --> 00:46:47,200
Rym: Hey, I'll get back to the case.

729
00:46:47,541 --> 00:47:05,354
Rym: so the other thing I realized part of the reason I picked this case is that the way to put a CPU cooler on today is Do it like most people do just fucking randomly buy one and it doesn't fit in your case and you have problems Buy one that's like this giant piece of ridiculous metal that fills the entire inside of your case.

730
00:47:05,475 --> 00:47:07,787
Rym: what that's what most CPU coolers look like.

731
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:15,600
Rym: or Get a liquid pump where there's just one little contact on the CPU and then you put this big radiator like on the a like.

732
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,266
Rym: You know where your fans go in the front of your case.

733
00:47:17,548 --> 00:47:20,540
Rym: you put a radiator there behind the fans instead.

734
00:47:21,002 --> 00:47:30,340
Rym: So the CPU is radiating to this giant thin radiator Right where your fans are far away from the actual CPU and just pumping liquid back and forth between it.

735
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:31,544
Scott: Do you need a pump for that?

736
00:47:31,564 --> 00:47:32,107
Rym: They.

737
00:47:32,127 --> 00:47:34,014
Rym: so you buy these self-enclosed things.

738
00:47:34,255 --> 00:47:35,560
Scott: What if the liquid comes out?

739
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:41,206
Scott: What if it breaks what it you know, then your CPU over there's like hoses or like yeah It's all a built-in unit.

740
00:47:41,226 --> 00:47:43,679
Rym: the failure rate on these things is actually really really low.

741
00:47:44,442 --> 00:47:47,171
Scott: I know I feel like it's gonna spill everywhere and ruin everything.

742
00:47:47,612 --> 00:47:48,836
Rym: one if it spills everywhere.

743
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:50,160
Rym: It's not gonna break anything.

744
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,191
Rym: It's just a moderate like oil whatever mess.

745
00:47:52,291 --> 00:47:52,492
Scott: It's not.

746
00:47:52,552 --> 00:47:53,176
Scott: it's not water.

747
00:47:53,397 --> 00:47:54,020
Rym: It's not water.

748
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,538
Rym: No, you don't put water in something like this.

749
00:47:56,263 --> 00:48:16,012
Rym: but basically this that's the best way to do it that I can see and after reading a bunch of guys a lot of people do crazy crap that I'm not gonna do where they'll basically buy like a water reservoir and Instead of having this self-contained unit that someone else put together that you just buy and install They'll buy a pump they'll buy all the different pipes.

750
00:48:16,373 --> 00:48:22,496
Rym: They'll have this connected to Another system that's also cooling the inside of their motherboard and all their other bits.

751
00:48:22,536 --> 00:48:23,700
Rym: this ridiculous nonsense.

752
00:48:24,322 --> 00:48:31,521
Rym: So instead I'm just getting this one cracking thing that cools the CPU and because that is made by the same company that makes that Case.

753
00:48:32,164 --> 00:48:33,690
Rym: it's guaranteed to fit perfectly.

754
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:34,674
Scott: the case doesn't come with it.

755
00:48:34,875 --> 00:48:35,979
Rym: No case doesn't come with that.

756
00:48:37,082 --> 00:48:37,926
Scott: Well, they got you.

757
00:48:37,946 --> 00:48:38,689
Rym: It doesn't know what.

758
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:39,232
Rym: how much is?

759
00:48:39,252 --> 00:48:40,216
Scott: how much is this thing?

760
00:48:40,337 --> 00:48:40,859
Rym: hundred bucks?

761
00:48:42,201 --> 00:48:45,467
Scott: Oh If I'm paying zero, but you pretty.

762
00:48:45,527 --> 00:48:49,520
Scott: instead of getting that you could have gotten two m2s, right pretty much God.

763
00:48:49,782 --> 00:48:52,400
Rym: What CPU are you gonna buy if you buy a new computer?

764
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,346
Rym: Are you gonna get the fastest Intel chip?

765
00:48:54,366 --> 00:48:55,189
Rym: Cuz there's no cooler.

766
00:48:55,671 --> 00:48:58,000
Scott: I'll just get like a cheapo cooler for 20 bucks.

767
00:48:58,581 --> 00:48:59,524
Rym: What cheapo cooler?

768
00:48:59,684 --> 00:49:01,669
Scott: or I'll buy an Intel cooler from someone.

769
00:49:02,411 --> 00:49:04,877
Rym: the stock Intel cooler cannot clock.

770
00:49:04,937 --> 00:49:06,300
Rym: cool that chip effectively.

771
00:49:06,421 --> 00:49:07,939
Rym: It'll run at about three point four gigahertz.

772
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:10,130
Scott: If you put that I'm sure there is a normal cooler.

773
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:11,938
Scott: I can find a new egg if I looked.

774
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:12,280
Rym: yeah.

775
00:49:12,421 --> 00:49:14,476
Rym: So what you can get if you for about 40 bucks?

776
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:15,989
Rym: Let me check new eggs.

777
00:49:16,029 --> 00:49:20,935
Rym: for 40 or 50 bucks You can get one of the giant ones that fills the whole inside of your case with metal.

778
00:49:21,116 --> 00:49:33,004
Rym: No, I don't want that For 80 bucks you can get a smaller radiator But reports seem to indicate that the clock the chip tends to only run at like 3.8 gigahertz if you get that one Mm-hmm.

779
00:49:33,689 --> 00:49:35,240
Rym: I did a lot of research on these.

780
00:49:35,541 --> 00:49:45,091
Rym: I might be able to get away with one smaller cooler and save a little bit of money and I actually haven't finished that research Yet, but this seemed this is the guaranteed safe cooler.

781
00:49:45,111 --> 00:49:48,160
Rym: because another thing I went guaranteed safe on was the power supply.

782
00:49:49,141 --> 00:49:59,864
Rym: so I did a lot of research as to how much power modern computers need and Every and all the calculations I could do said that I need about a 550 to 650 watt power supply.

783
00:50:03,021 --> 00:50:14,800
Rym: So I'm getting a 760 watt one and I'm getting a really high quality one because that guarantees 100% will not have a power supply problem because I just never want to deal with a power supply problem again on a computer ever.

784
00:50:15,341 --> 00:50:16,745
Rym: This one's super highly rated.

785
00:50:16,806 --> 00:50:17,949
Rym: It's some Corsair whatever.

786
00:50:17,969 --> 00:50:19,654
Rym: It's platinum certified.

787
00:50:19,714 --> 00:50:24,634
Rym: So it'll actually save me a moderate amount of money and The reviews again seem pretty good.

788
00:50:26,542 --> 00:50:27,465
Rym: What else did I get in here?

789
00:50:28,329 --> 00:50:29,795
Rym: so the case yeah, it's that NXT.

790
00:50:29,835 --> 00:50:31,080
Rym: whatever case I'll just link to it.

791
00:50:31,423 --> 00:50:32,859
Rym: Seriously, I think it's a really good case.

792
00:50:33,742 --> 00:50:35,519
Rym: There's probably a better case out there.

793
00:50:36,021 --> 00:50:42,360
Rym: I am NOT willing to spend the effort to find it because this case is really good and it's only and it's only 100 bucks.

794
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:44,417
Scott: So here is a cooler master.

795
00:50:44,477 --> 00:50:50,354
Scott: hyper 212 Evo CPU cooler with 120 millimeter PWM fan 120.

796
00:50:50,354 --> 00:50:51,617
Rym: All right, so that'll be a little loud.

797
00:50:51,637 --> 00:50:55,585
Scott: It's the highest Rated cooler on Newegg.

798
00:50:55,705 --> 00:50:56,447
Scott: It's $30.

799
00:50:56,447 --> 00:50:57,831
Scott: You can even it's 25 after a fine.

800
00:50:57,851 --> 00:50:58,594
Scott: Is that for LGA 1151?

801
00:50:58,594 --> 00:51:10,332
Scott: it is LGA 1151 and it says in CPU support core i7 extreme All right, and it looks it looks pretty small.

802
00:51:10,473 --> 00:51:11,980
Scott: It's just you know, it looks like a normal cooler.

803
00:51:12,341 --> 00:51:16,036
Scott: It's got some pipe thingy sticking out the side of it and it's you know, so it does.

804
00:51:16,076 --> 00:51:17,060
Rym: so it doesn't have a radiator.

805
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:17,485
Rym: It's just like.

806
00:51:17,545 --> 00:51:19,382
Scott: it's like it looks like a radiator But yeah, it's.

807
00:51:19,483 --> 00:51:23,220
Scott: it's pretty much just looks like that, you know an alternative to the Intel normal cooler.

808
00:51:23,361 --> 00:51:25,198
Scott: But it doesn't look ridiculous or large or anything.

809
00:51:25,862 --> 00:51:27,447
Scott: It's perfectly serviceable for 30 bucks.

810
00:51:27,527 --> 00:51:31,540
Rym: a little bit of follow-up research before I've read those kinds of coolers won't fully cool this chip.

811
00:51:31,761 --> 00:51:35,360
Scott: Well, it has five eggs and four thousand and nineteen reviews.

812
00:51:36,207 --> 00:51:37,519
Scott: So that sounds promising to me.

813
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:40,390
Rym: the other thing that worries me is you said 120 millimeter fan.

814
00:51:40,691 --> 00:51:43,300
Rym: that implies that it's a lot louder than the one I'm getting.

815
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:47,600
Scott: the Main selling point of the way, I guess if you have the liquid going to a radio, there's no fan, right?

816
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,224
Rym: Well, there's.

817
00:51:48,344 --> 00:51:49,551
Rym: you have your case fans in the front.

818
00:51:49,571 --> 00:51:51,160
Rym: Like there are still those are those are there.

819
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:53,790
Scott: Anyway, and also that one less you have one less fan.

820
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:59,069
Rym: Yeah, but here's also that annex that case I'm getting the NX zxt or whatever.

821
00:51:59,189 --> 00:52:04,125
Scott: The first review says quieter than stock fans Both AMD and Intel.

822
00:52:04,145 --> 00:52:11,320
Rym: the review of this crowd this cracking thing in this case basically says it is fucking silence Mm-hmm, but this case is only a hundred bucks.

823
00:52:11,441 --> 00:52:14,498
Rym: I paid more than that for the case I got now and I do not like the case I got now.

824
00:52:15,741 --> 00:52:18,273
Scott: This says provides really good temperature control to an i7 6700 K.

825
00:52:20,041 --> 00:52:24,040
Rym: All right, maybe I'll do a little more research on the cooler 30 bucks for just a normal old cooler.

826
00:52:24,663 --> 00:52:25,989
Scott: I don't know why it says Intel.

827
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:28,140
Scott: they could have just charged $30 more included one of these.

828
00:52:28,362 --> 00:52:29,600
Rym: That's what it is interesting.

829
00:52:29,701 --> 00:52:33,100
Rym: It still bothers me because I didn't notice until a couple months ago that Intel does.

830
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:37,600
Scott: I don't know how much research you did because this is just like the top of new egg the number one rated cooler.

831
00:52:37,802 --> 00:52:47,480
Rym: Yeah, I can go back and see because Multiple of the like cooler master whatever's the reviews I was reading said that the chip only ran at like three point six three point seven like it wouldn't say you think right there.

832
00:52:47,821 --> 00:52:48,785
Rym: Yeah, and I'll look at it.

833
00:52:48,805 --> 00:52:50,873
Scott: It was on the front page of new egg cooler section.

834
00:52:50,893 --> 00:52:53,909
Rym: Oh What else did I get in this case?

835
00:52:54,413 --> 00:52:56,983
Rym: So the other thing I'm getting Ram, whatever.

836
00:52:57,264 --> 00:52:59,632
Rym: just 32 gigs of RAM like Rams.

837
00:52:59,672 --> 00:53:02,100
Scott: Ram the different memory brand brand isn't superior.

838
00:53:02,602 --> 00:53:03,444
Rym: I just got the Corsair.

839
00:53:03,485 --> 00:53:04,749
Rym: whatever is a good price point.

840
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:10,809
Rym: I'm getting 2x16 because eventually I'll probably upgrade and That seems like the best.

841
00:53:10,849 --> 00:53:13,783
Scott: I have 32 and it's more RAM than I've ever used ever I've never.

842
00:53:14,185 --> 00:53:18,767
Scott: I don't think I'm gonna need more than 32 unless there's like Someone starts writing some really bad software.

843
00:53:18,807 --> 00:53:21,155
Rym: my current computers, but I work at work.

844
00:53:21,175 --> 00:53:25,140
Scott: well at work I have eight and it's definitely not enough.

845
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,700
Scott: I run out of RAM at work like chrome unloads tabs that are in the background because it's out of RAM.

846
00:53:30,263 --> 00:53:32,700
Scott: Oh, I have to you know, so I got to get a new computer at work.

847
00:53:32,841 --> 00:53:37,217
Rym: I got 32 gig at work and 12 of that is running a really powerful VM.

848
00:53:37,237 --> 00:53:38,100
Rym: that I do a whole bunch of crap.

849
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,651
Scott: Yeah, VMS are killing me at work.

850
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,380
Rym: I Got a crappy firewire card, whatever.

851
00:53:43,021 --> 00:53:49,987
Rym: But one more thing that I got is I did buy some spinning discs because I was you don't have existing spin and is Yeah, I'm not gonna use them.

852
00:53:50,088 --> 00:53:52,480
Rym: I'm not taking anything out of this old computer except the video card.

853
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,832
Scott: Are the spinning just perfectly good?

854
00:53:53,954 --> 00:53:54,579
Rym: They're ancient.

855
00:53:56,203 --> 00:53:57,458
Scott: These there that are perfectly good.

856
00:53:58,501 --> 00:53:59,766
Rym: Yeah, I'm gonna keep this computer.

857
00:53:59,786 --> 00:54:00,589
Rym: I'm gonna use it for something.

858
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:01,432
Scott: Okay.

859
00:54:01,673 --> 00:54:03,480
Rym: My HD PC is on its last legs.

860
00:54:03,561 --> 00:54:05,303
Rym: I might just make this the HD PC The same one as I do.

861
00:54:05,324 --> 00:54:05,666
Scott: mine's great.

862
00:54:08,341 --> 00:54:09,265
Rym: It's overheating for one.

863
00:54:09,285 --> 00:54:10,028
Rym: I got to clean it out.

864
00:54:10,329 --> 00:54:11,233
Scott: She doesn't have any problem.

865
00:54:11,273 --> 00:54:12,840
Rym: hard drive has some bad sectors.

866
00:54:13,161 --> 00:54:14,286
Rym: There's only one hard drive in it.

867
00:54:14,326 --> 00:54:15,410
Scott: This mine has one hard drive.

868
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:16,354
Scott: That's perfectly fine.

869
00:54:16,595 --> 00:54:17,840
Rym: Well, mine's got some bad sectors.

870
00:54:19,844 --> 00:54:22,113
Rym: Yeah, also it stutters sometimes when it's playing video.

871
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:22,374
Rym: I got it.

872
00:54:22,414 --> 00:54:23,397
Rym: I got a futz with a little bit.

873
00:54:23,417 --> 00:54:24,060
Scott: mine doesn't do that.

874
00:54:24,401 --> 00:54:26,927
Rym: It's got an old GTX 460 in it.

875
00:54:27,248 --> 00:54:30,517
Scott: Mine has like a low-profile and ATI AMD card.

876
00:54:30,557 --> 00:54:31,500
Scott: that never had a problem.

877
00:54:31,741 --> 00:54:34,580
Rym: Yeah, but also maybe I'll just sell this computer because it's perfectly good.

878
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:36,491
Rym: But most of the drives in it are ancient.

879
00:54:36,531 --> 00:54:37,799
Rym: like I haven't said I have SSDs.

880
00:54:38,681 --> 00:54:42,130
Rym: Only one of those SSDs is a modern reasonably performing one.

881
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:44,698
Rym: The other ones are old as shit and slow as shit.

882
00:54:44,718 --> 00:54:47,085
Rym: by modern standards There's no point in keeping them.

883
00:54:47,105 --> 00:54:49,091
Rym: Mm-hmm and the spinning discs.

884
00:54:49,593 --> 00:54:50,917
Rym: They're old and low-capacity.

885
00:54:50,937 --> 00:54:51,860
Rym: Like why would I even care?

886
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:56,017
Rym: I could stick them in the new computer just to have access to that old data that I don't need.

887
00:54:56,037 --> 00:55:15,160
Rym: so But I was thinking about buying a new NAS and it's actually much more cost effective to just buy two four terabyte 5400 rpm discs for cheap and Just stick them in there and do a mirror and that'll just be my raid effectively.

888
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:16,448
Rym: I'll just back everything up there.

889
00:55:16,469 --> 00:55:18,119
Scott: I just use my NAS.

890
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:20,087
Rym: My NAS is only two terabytes.

891
00:55:20,529 --> 00:55:23,440
Scott: Mine is like six because I have four two terabyte drives in it.

892
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,806
Rym: Yeah, I bought my NAS is old.

893
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,891
Rym: It's only takes two disks.

894
00:55:26,012 --> 00:55:26,735
Scott: It's almost full though.

895
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:27,700
Scott: I'm gonna have to clean out some stuff.

896
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,700
Rym: Yeah, mine is also always teetering on full.

897
00:55:29,821 --> 00:55:33,000
Rym: I just recently dumped the whole thing up to Amazon cloud drive and I started deleting stuff.

898
00:55:33,585 --> 00:55:35,138
Scott: I might do something like that cuz yeah.

899
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:47,180
Rym: But basically I've got so much like b-roll and all these things and for a long time I would back him up to the NAS and Eventually, I'd take stuff that I wasn't accessing and I stuck it on two redundant external drives and just like file them away.

900
00:55:48,302 --> 00:55:59,528
Rym: but I realized it'd be much more convenient if I just kept everything local and Four terabytes I can keep like all the video will gather from GeekNights the next five years Just local and not even think about it.

901
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:02,739
Rym: It'll be just as redundant and it'll still be backed up to the cloud.

902
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:08,700
Rym: and It's way cheaper just to buy two for four terabyte like slow efficient drives.

903
00:56:08,981 --> 00:56:09,904
Rym: I just throw them in there.

904
00:56:10,246 --> 00:56:13,116
Rym: then it is to upgrade my NAS like so much cheaper.

905
00:56:13,176 --> 00:56:14,200
Rym: That's not even a question.

906
00:56:17,003 --> 00:56:20,680
Rym: So yeah, that's pretty much the computer that I'm probably gonna buy other than some tweaks.

907
00:56:21,501 --> 00:56:22,966
Rym: I don't know when I'll actually pull the trigger.

908
00:56:22,986 --> 00:56:27,985
Rym: cuz like I said, there's no Limitations.

909
00:56:28,529 --> 00:56:32,048
Rym: there's nowhere near failing Like I'm using it now.

910
00:56:32,068 --> 00:56:33,435
Scott: We just like buying stuff.

911
00:56:34,038 --> 00:56:34,961
Rym: Not really it's just.

912
00:56:35,042 --> 00:56:46,674
Rym: I can't easily edit 4k video and the lack of USB 3 and the lack of like modern SATA and the fact that even My 770 is running slower because I don't even have modern PCI Express.

913
00:56:47,056 --> 00:56:48,239
Rym: It's all starting to add up.

914
00:56:54,254 --> 00:56:56,790
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

933
00:58:31,223 --> 00:58:47,012
Rym: I would put that up many days ago but there was a oddly specific patreon problem that I have a ticket open with them and Basically, I can upload 160 kilobit per second mp3s of any length up to 100 megabytes but 192 kilobit per second mp3.

934
00:58:47,474 --> 00:58:52,551
Rym: it just hangs forever and They can reproduce it but they can't explain it.
