00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,273
Rym: It's Thursday, May 8th.

2
00:00:11,734 --> 00:00:12,215
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,456 --> 00:00:13,057
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,177 --> 00:00:14,680
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,921 --> 00:00:19,310
Rym: Tonight on Thursday, the lounge, we bring you the GeekNights book club.

6
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,918
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,027
Scott: This morning I drive down to the train station.

8
00:00:33,128 --> 00:00:33,549
Rym: Like you do.

9
00:00:33,569 --> 00:00:35,897
Scott: I'm pulling my car into the parking lot there.

10
00:00:36,018 --> 00:00:36,379
Rym: Like you do.

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,204
Scott: Oh, you gotta stop saying that.

12
00:00:38,264 --> 00:00:42,218
Scott: And there's a really big goose in the parking lot.

13
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:42,800
Scott: Right?

14
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:46,048
Scott: You know, it's not like, it's right in the middle of the road.

15
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:51,040
Scott: So it's like I can't pull into the spots on the left or the right because the goose is there.

16
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,650
Rym: Now is this a Canadian goose?

17
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:53,920
Rym: Or one of those white geese?

18
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,500
Scott: I'm not a goose expert.

19
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:58,220
Rym: Alright, was it all white or was it gray and black?

20
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,939
Scott: It was whitish-gray body with like a black...

21
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,300
Rym: Alright, it's a Canadian goose.

22
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,328
Scott: Anyway, it was huge.

23
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:07,320
Scott: Like, turkey size.

24
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,480
Rym: That's how big Canadian geese are.

25
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:10,825
Scott: It's a big ass goose.

26
00:01:10,885 --> 00:01:12,230
Scott: And it was just standing there.

27
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,080
Scott: Like, it can fly, but it wasn't flying.

28
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:15,658
Scott: You know why?

29
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,520
Scott: It can only take off from the water.

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,303
Rym: I'll tell you one thing.

31
00:01:18,424 --> 00:01:21,480
Rym: I really like geese, but Canadian geese are...

32
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:24,020
Scott: And then they shit everywhere.

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,439
Rym: Canadian geese are assholes.

34
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,800
Scott: Pretty much the assholes of the bird kingdom.

35
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,992
Scott: But anyway, so this goose is just standing there in the middle of the road and I just sort of stop.

36
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:35,657
Scott: And I'm like, honk at it.

37
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,640
Rym: He'll just honk back.

38
00:01:37,942 --> 00:01:40,959
Scott: I could flash my brights at it during the day.

39
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:47,760
Scott: I'm just sitting there and it starts to slowly just walk to the left a little bit.

40
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:53,757
Scott: I was able to pull around it and park, but just like big goose standing in the road being like, whatever.

41
00:01:53,777 --> 00:01:54,559
Scott: I'm big goose.

42
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,725
Rym: You know why geese do that?

43
00:01:56,745 --> 00:02:02,460
Rym: Because it was kind of a pastime in Michigan when I was a kid where, you know, we'd go to a park and there'd be Canadian geese.

44
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,804
Rym: They'd all kind of keep to themselves.

45
00:02:04,586 --> 00:02:09,660
Rym: Inevitably, the drunk guy would walk over and try to chase the geese away.

46
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:10,919
Scott: And they'd all peck him to death.

47
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,475
Rym: Well, they'd all just look at him for a while like, all right, drunk guy, we've played this game before.

48
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:16,740
Rym: You obviously have not.

49
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:22,600
Rym: And it would always end in ahh and they got to be running away and they'd be like 50 geese just killing it.

50
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:30,180
Scott: It's like other birds, like, you know, this problem with other birds, it's only like geese and seagulls, the only birds that ever cause a problem.

51
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,988
Scott: Even crows are less like not bothering people.

52
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:34,573
Scott: You know, they're just hanging out crowing.

53
00:02:34,914 --> 00:02:37,000
Scott: It's only geese and seagulls that fuck with people.

54
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:38,143
Scott: And I think so.

55
00:02:38,184 --> 00:02:43,120
Rym: I think, well, seagulls do it for food and geese do it because they're pissed off.

56
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,925
Scott: It's like turkeys, wild turkeys.

57
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:46,128
Scott: don't bother anybody.

58
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:47,773
Scott: You know, it depends.

59
00:02:47,813 --> 00:02:50,420
Scott: Little birds like little tiny birds don't bother anybody.

60
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:52,279
Scott: Hey, pigeons don't even bother people.

61
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,629
Rym: You've never spent any time around a lovebird.

62
00:02:54,649 --> 00:02:57,080
Rym: Pigeons are lovebirds.

63
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:08,608
Rym: Sometimes I'd be sitting there, like working on the computer, and suddenly I just hear fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff

64
00:03:08,628 --> 00:03:10,949

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:47,240
Rym: fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff

84
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,965

Rym: fluff fluff

Scott: fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff

87
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:18,891
Rym: fluff fluff fluff fluff fluff

88
00:10:47,910 --> 00:11:18,773
Scott: fluff fluff fluff or bad ones.

89
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:21,802
Scott: but i say they're bad and i haven't tried them.

90
00:11:21,823 --> 00:11:26,897
Scott: then that's sort of like proving the high quality of my judgment.

91
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,362
Scott: it's like if i can.

92
00:11:28,463 --> 00:11:40,390
Scott: if i consistently pick awesome things without actually looking at them very closely and they all actually turn out to be awesome then that shows that i'm very good at judging what is good and what is bad based on very little information.

93
00:11:41,052 --> 00:11:53,658
Scott: so maybe if i keep doing that and i'm consistent then nobody would be much more difficult for someone to come to me and say don't not get before you tried it because i could say hey i didn't try another shit and i was right about that.

94
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:58,936
Scott: but anyway my thing of the day is something i glanced at for about a minute.

95
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:17,697
Scott: so i guess it doesn't really count towards my uh evidence pile and based on the title alone i mean it's not really you know uh telling you how awesome i am at judging because anyone upon seeing the title could immediately know how awesome it is plus you the fact that it's on boing boing sort of.

96
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:20,709
Scott: you know someone already awesome already judged it.

97
00:12:20,749 --> 00:12:22,234
Scott: so that's like you know.

98
00:12:22,254 --> 00:12:30,159
Scott: i sort of be uh ganking i guess it may be the right word or vamping off of someone else's judgment powers to uh it's all right.

99
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,114
Scott: but basically what this is is soviet sci-fi illustrations.

100
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:37,703
Scott: hard to go wrong with that people.

101
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:56,715
Scott: now the one thing i want to say about these soviet science fiction illustrations is not only are they awesome soviet sci-fi illustrations but they really bring across this message of being optimistic about science and the future and for all the bad

102
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:57,097
Rym: that

103
00:12:57,137 --> 00:13:08,233
Scott: was in the soviet union in fact for all the bad that was the cold war in general one and perhaps the best thing about the cold war if there was any good thing about it was that in the?

104
00:13:08,353 --> 00:13:08,654
Scott: u.s.

105
00:13:08,674 --> 00:13:20,691
Scott: in the soviet union in most of the world everyone was really optimistic about science and technology were going and they wanted to progress science and technology in a real bad way.

106
00:13:20,711 --> 00:13:28,773
Scott: and i think since the end of the cold war we've sort of lost that quite a bit and uh we needed some more.

107
00:13:28,793 --> 00:13:35,153
Scott: i definitely think so especially looking at all the anti-intellectualism stuff that's been happening.

108
00:13:35,494 --> 00:13:37,240
Scott: it's not pleasant for us science.

109
00:13:37,521 --> 00:13:44,785
Rym: uh thinking types yes not to say that the soviet union had the the wonderful open scientific discourse.

110
00:13:44,845 --> 00:13:53,955
Scott: no no no but all i'm saying is that the attitude of the people towards science was like we want science we want better science than everyone else.

111
00:13:54,136 --> 00:13:55,723
Scott: you know we want to move science forward.

112
00:13:55,985 --> 00:13:57,632
Rym: well we used to have space races.

113
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,404
Scott: yeah now we should have other kinds of races.

114
00:14:00,444 --> 00:14:02,492
Scott: we should have like you know tech races or something.

115
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:02,813
Scott: i don't know.

116
00:14:03,716 --> 00:14:05,141
Scott: so uh we got memristors.

117
00:14:05,221 --> 00:14:07,690
Rym: take that going along with the whole soviet thing.

118
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,323
Rym: i i really couldn't find anything i cared about.

119
00:14:10,343 --> 00:14:13,236
Rym: i mean what i'm gonna go to dig and there's gonna be nothing there.

120
00:14:13,336 --> 00:14:14,561
Scott: did you find a soviet thing?

121
00:14:14,702 --> 00:14:15,083
Scott: maybe?

122
00:14:15,485 --> 00:14:16,288
Rym: so then i go to.

123
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:18,557
Rym: uh college humor but something soviet there.

124
00:14:18,698 --> 00:14:25,767
Rym: if you're smart now you've probably realized that if you want to see good stuff or you want to see our things of the day just go to college humor.

125
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:30,705
Scott: well anything that video ones at least yeah because i mean there's a bunch of video sites now.

126
00:14:31,227 --> 00:14:46,483
Scott: but college humor is the only one that seems to have like editorial people picking the videos and they also all their original content that they make is also really good and they seem to be really good at picking or at least really in line with the tastes of Rym and Scott in their picking.

127
00:14:47,526 --> 00:14:52,240
Rym: thus i have for you not one not two but three things of the day.

128
00:14:52,261 --> 00:14:52,983
Scott: oh good god.

129
00:14:54,046 --> 00:14:55,711
Rym: oh scott i think he can see over my shoulder.

130
00:14:56,334 --> 00:14:57,961
Scott: no i'm not looking i've got my eyes closed.

131
00:14:58,624 --> 00:15:00,711
Rym: you should look at this all right let me look hold on.

132
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:06,321
Scott: i saw something involving uh soviet osamanga dio.

133
00:15:08,345 --> 00:15:11,432
Rym: someone made a kind of soviet cross between.

134
00:15:11,472 --> 00:15:17,993
Rym: well the soviet cross a cross between osamanga dio and soviet propaganda and it's it's pretty cool.

135
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:19,077
Scott: that's how it should be done.

136
00:15:19,137 --> 00:15:20,622
Scott: people take a lesson.

137
00:15:21,324 --> 00:15:31,055
Rym: but also i found this fairly awesome old soviet animation that is super anti-hitler which i guess is expected it should be.

138
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:35,990
Scott: i mean worst enemy i mean if you're thinking worst enemy of the soviet union right.

139
00:15:36,211 --> 00:15:39,841
Rym: probably hitler probably hitler i mean or maybe cold.

140
00:15:39,861 --> 00:15:46,204
Scott: i mean they were more anti-hitler in world war ii than they were anti-us in the cold war that's for sure.

141
00:15:46,465 --> 00:15:49,900
Rym: but this is i mean while the first thing's kind of funny this is kind of one.

142
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,270
Rym: it's subtitled which makes this extra interesting.

143
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:58,115
Rym: oh sweet they gotta watch because you always see the american like world war ii gotta get the nazis like cartoons and things.

144
00:15:58,176 --> 00:16:08,312
Rym: but here's kind of the other side of it i. well i guess the third side of it the soviets who were on our side and their propaganda in the same direction i.

145
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:11,846
Scott: that's one thing that i was actually i learned like in middle school.

146
00:16:12,027 --> 00:16:12,248
Scott: you know.

147
00:16:12,288 --> 00:16:14,879
Scott: that really surprised me because you know it's sort of like.

148
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:21,345
Scott: i didn't really have a full grasp of history yet so i knew sort of like hitler bad and communism russia.

149
00:16:21,365 --> 00:16:28,672
Scott: there aren't many people who don't know i know right but i didn't realize at the at my young age that they were actually like.

150
00:16:28,752 --> 00:16:30,297
Scott: you know i figured bad and bad.

151
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:32,383
Scott: they're not too much hating each other.

152
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:40,726
Scott: really though i mean we have russia the communism right hitler the fascism and the u.s.

153
00:16:40,826 --> 00:16:43,233
Scott: the you know representative democracy type.

154
00:16:44,175 --> 00:16:52,617
Scott: if you think communism hates representative democracy of capitalisms they fascisms like 10 000 times more.

155
00:16:53,919 --> 00:17:07,094
Scott: so um in our changing of the thursday action right one of the things we sort of decided to do is something that's really cliche and just about all sorts of different shows do it.

156
00:17:07,295 --> 00:17:09,703
Rym: we're gonna have the GeekNights book club.

157
00:17:09,884 --> 00:17:11,388
Rym: oh man it's a book club.

158
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:14,521
Scott: i mean geeks i mean everyone has a freaking book club.

159
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,866
Scott: i mean what show does?

160
00:17:16,107 --> 00:17:17,733
Scott: it's hard to find a show without a book club.

161
00:17:17,874 --> 00:17:20,045
Rym: anime world order does not have a book club.

162
00:17:20,226 --> 00:17:21,712
Scott: i guess they don't but they probably should.

163
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,217
Scott: but anyway.

164
00:17:23,278 --> 00:17:26,167
Scott: so we decided hey everyone else is doing a book club.

165
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:28,678
Scott: right book clubs are actually kind of cool and you know what.

166
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:36,613
Scott: i think that our book club will actually be more valuable than a lot of the other book clubs out there because we're not going to pick the super popular books.

167
00:17:36,633 --> 00:17:38,942
Scott: we're sort of going to pick books that people don't know about.

168
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:54,135
Scott: and you know it'll sort of because we've been sort of lacking on these spoilerific final thoughts kind of things and if we do a book club properly we'll sort of have these monthly final thoughts on the books and it should be fun.

169
00:17:54,276 --> 00:18:00,374
Scott: and also it'll sort of you know if we just say hey people buy this right some of them buy it.

170
00:18:00,855 --> 00:18:10,210
Scott: but if we say hey people buy this and exactly one month from now there's going to be a show on it where we're going to spoil the crap out of it i think a lot more people will buy it.

171
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:15,972
Rym: yeah plus i mean the thing is we're experimenting here so we're going to see exactly how this all plays out.

172
00:18:15,992 --> 00:18:22,561
Rym: but i think the plan going forward is anytime we do the book club we'll kind of review a book and then that will be yours.

173
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:30,119
Rym: all right this is the book we're going to read this month but we'll review it as a so you can tell right away if you think it's the kind of thing you're going to want to read or if you just don't care.

174
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:37,373
Scott: yes i think the plan is where other book clubs right they sort of just say read this book and then at the end of the month or whatever they review the whole book.

175
00:18:37,414 --> 00:18:41,750
Scott: like crazily i think what we'll do is we'll review the next book.

176
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:43,616
Scott: well we'll probably start the.

177
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,423
Scott: my headphones are fucking up.

178
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:55,499
Scott: we'll probably start the episode right by doing the crazy final thoughts on like the current book club book and maybe get some people on and have like discussion topics.

179
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:56,161
Rym: that yeah there's.

180
00:18:56,322 --> 00:19:00,320
Rym: there's very much going to be a round table element to the final thoughts.

181
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:05,005
Scott: maybe you can skype in some listeners who've read the book or some other front row crew people who've read the book.

182
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:12,576
Rym: i can tell you one thing though the book we're starting with which is kind of a cop-out but the reason why it's a necessary book to start with yes it's we.

183
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:25,060
Rym: i've brought it up several times but don't even try to be skyped in because already i think everyone in the front row crew is thinking well i'm certainly going to be skyped in or be in person at least you know well.

184
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:30,077
Rym: only i guess ten of you can be in our house for the final thoughts episode.

185
00:19:30,117 --> 00:19:31,584
Rym: i only have that many microphones.

186
00:19:31,644 --> 00:19:33,352
Scott: if that boundary mic shows up we'll be all right.

187
00:19:33,493 --> 00:19:34,698
Rym: yeah we'll see when that shows up.

188
00:19:34,718 --> 00:19:35,683
Rym: thank you amazon.

189
00:19:35,864 --> 00:19:38,919
Scott: yeah oh we could all you know we could do the amazon affiliates thing.

190
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:42,276
Scott: so we kind of get money if people buy the book by clicking the link on our website.

191
00:19:42,296 --> 00:19:43,382
Rym: oh yeah set that up tonight.

192
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,757
Scott: all right the thing is i gotta we'll be full disclosure though about it.

193
00:19:46,777 --> 00:19:50,953
Scott: we'll be like we'll put a link to the book on amazon on our website.

194
00:19:51,134 --> 00:19:57,132
Scott: but if you click on that link and then buy the book we get money but you don't pay any more money.

195
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:58,919
Scott: you pay the same normal amazon price.

196
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,537
Scott: basically amazon makes less profit than they normally would and we get some money.

197
00:20:03,618 --> 00:20:08,256
Rym: so if you want to stick it to the man feel free to not buy it through our stupid link.

198
00:20:08,517 --> 00:20:09,621
Scott: yes you you will.

199
00:20:09,802 --> 00:20:12,713
Scott: in that case you will give more profit to amazon and no money to us.

200
00:20:12,773 --> 00:20:18,815
Scott: and you know while we i don't like making money off of people like this um being wide open about it.

201
00:20:19,056 --> 00:20:22,710
Scott: well i have the option not to do it i don't like doesn't cost you anything extra.

202
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:29,659
Scott: if you're going to buy the book anyway you're given the same amount of money and i think people are listening to the show would would gladly.

203
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:35,570
Scott: you're basically by clicking a link taking a dot and buying a book you would have bought anywhere taking dollars away from amazon.

204
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:40,412
Rym: and well how many people have just sent us money unsolicitedly over the year even though we tell them not to.

205
00:20:40,633 --> 00:20:41,738
Scott: yeah don't send us money.

206
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:43,586
Rym: yeah and we're serious we really don't need it.

207
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:48,244
Scott: yeah and only click on the affiliate amazon book link if you want to.

208
00:20:48,324 --> 00:20:48,625
Scott: you don't.

209
00:20:48,786 --> 00:20:49,849
Scott: we won't be mad if you don't.

210
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,154
Rym: yeah but don't worry i mean we.

211
00:20:51,194 --> 00:20:57,240
Rym: we said way way back years ago you know 480 something episodes ago that there will never be ads and GeekNights.

212
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:57,642
Rym: you know what?

213
00:20:57,964 --> 00:20:59,251
Rym: there will never be ads and GeekNights.

214
00:20:59,311 --> 00:20:59,853
Scott: no there won't.

215
00:21:00,194 --> 00:21:14,658
Rym: so tonight we are going to introduce for our inaugural book club in this kind of cop-out tired thursday night episode that we're totally almost bailing on here the prince of nothing.

216
00:21:14,678 --> 00:21:17,647
Scott: now wait for the so one month from now right?

217
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:24,631
Scott: so i guess there's gonna be three thursday episodes and then the fourth thursday episode from now will be the book club episode.

218
00:21:24,692 --> 00:21:26,176
Scott: we fully spoil this action.

219
00:21:26,296 --> 00:21:28,784
Rym: june 5th 2008 we will.

220
00:21:28,985 --> 00:21:31,232
Rym: we will have the prince of nothing round table.

221
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:38,076
Scott: so it's like the third the first thursday of the month every month unless the uh well most yeah pretty much the first thursday of every month.

222
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,945
Scott: now the thing is right.

223
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:51,272
Scott: this is a three book series and then there's more books coming out later that aren't out yet but it's pretty much a trilogy that stands on its own and the other books are going to be sort of separate-ish but also in the same universe.

224
00:21:51,453 --> 00:21:53,140
Rym: i feel like we should do the whole trilogy.

225
00:21:53,481 --> 00:21:54,586
Scott: see but can people?

226
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:56,494
Scott: i can read the whole trilogy in a month.

227
00:21:56,534 --> 00:21:57,237
Rym: god i read the.

228
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,366
Rym: i read the first book in like like.

229
00:21:59,466 --> 00:22:01,896
Rym: i started reading it and then two days later i was done.

230
00:22:01,957 --> 00:22:05,993
Scott: do you think that's too much to ask people to read three entire novels in a month?

231
00:22:06,374 --> 00:22:11,492
Rym: i see i don't think so because these books i i really feel like once you start reading them.

232
00:22:11,894 --> 00:22:15,871
Rym: it's a rare person who is not going to finish them as fast as humanly possible it is true.

233
00:22:15,911 --> 00:22:18,223
Scott: the other thing though is i'm not sure like when i bought them.

234
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:24,511
Scott: i bought the first one amazon the third one on amazon but the second one was not available on amazon except for used so i had to buy it.

235
00:22:24,632 --> 00:22:29,431
Scott: i was luckily in the crappy bookstore i hate but you know the worst bookstore in the city.

236
00:22:29,572 --> 00:22:31,199
Rym: it's not that bad of a bookstore.

237
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:32,003
Scott: no it's not that bad.

238
00:22:32,043 --> 00:22:38,086
Rym: you know what i think it's better than the uh barnes or no the borders near us the borders near us is all right.

239
00:22:38,127 --> 00:22:39,231
Rym: no the barnes and noble near us.

240
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,042
Scott: i'm sorry the one with all the bullshit books we have.

241
00:22:41,102 --> 00:22:43,113
Rym: we have a borders and barnes and noble up here in beacon.

242
00:22:43,575 --> 00:22:44,982
Scott: and well they're both in poughkeepsie.

243
00:22:45,022 --> 00:22:46,910
Rym: well the lower duchess county.

244
00:22:47,091 --> 00:22:48,016
Rym: they're not in poughkeepsie.

245
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,563
Rym: actually they're far from poughkeepsie.

246
00:22:49,603 --> 00:22:54,486
Rym: the barnes and noble's in poughkeepsie actually no it's in the town of poughkeepsie which is completely separate.

247
00:22:54,547 --> 00:22:54,989
Rym: no it's not.

248
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:56,334
Rym: they're not even border right now.

249
00:22:56,575 --> 00:23:01,173
Rym: anyway anyway they're completely separate one's way south one's much further north.

250
00:23:01,534 --> 00:23:03,761
Rym: but uh the borders isn't typical borders.

251
00:23:04,022 --> 00:23:07,173
Rym: barnes and noble is full of randy craft like that.

252
00:23:07,293 --> 00:23:13,036
Rym: that place must be run but like managed by the most randy person you can imagine because other barnes and noble aren't like that.

253
00:23:13,076 --> 00:23:15,744
Rym: it's just that one yep all right anyway.

254
00:23:15,804 --> 00:23:19,719
Scott: so the prince of rims talked about on the show before.

255
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:22,069
Scott: i think i talked about in the show a lot before.

256
00:23:22,089 --> 00:23:24,337
Scott: that's why it's the perfect first for the book club.

257
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:30,482
Rym: yeah scott in fact actually made a somewhat clever joke about the prince of nothing during the escaflona episode.

258
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:32,411
Scott: you might have caught it you might have not.

259
00:23:33,094 --> 00:23:34,841
Rym: i don't think it's hard to miss.

260
00:23:35,242 --> 00:23:37,210
Scott: well who knows if people listen to that episode or not?

261
00:23:37,771 --> 00:23:40,841
Scott: so the prince of nothing is basically.

262
00:23:41,242 --> 00:23:42,887
Scott: it's a series of fantasy novels.

263
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:43,629
Scott: it you know.

264
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:44,913
Scott: so we're talking.

265
00:23:44,933 --> 00:23:54,419
Scott: you know wizards dragons evil things that are kind of like orcs but not candidates paladins crusades.

266
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:59,592
Rym: see i understand why you you know jocularly pronounced knights incorrectly.

267
00:23:59,652 --> 00:24:01,398
Rym: but why paladin?

268
00:24:01,438 --> 00:24:02,120
Rym: and why?

269
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,925
Rym: yeah yeah added letters.

270
00:24:03,965 --> 00:24:04,748
Rym: you can't add letters.

271
00:24:05,229 --> 00:24:05,831
Rym: the joke there is.

272
00:24:05,851 --> 00:24:10,250
Rym: you got to take a word and pronounce all the letters like alfred hitchcock's precise.

273
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,653
Scott: i did pronounce all the letters.

274
00:24:11,894 --> 00:24:16,205
Rym: paladin there's no ing there's no.

275
00:24:16,345 --> 00:24:21,380
Rym: in the end quiet you could say paladin no that's all right anyway.

276
00:24:21,781 --> 00:24:28,707
Rym: but the one thing we got to say is that while these are fantasy books they are far from i guess stereotypical fantasy books.

277
00:24:28,748 --> 00:24:30,134
Rym: i mean you expect a fantasy book.

278
00:24:30,455 --> 00:24:31,038
Rym: go to the store.

279
00:24:31,058 --> 00:24:31,922
Rym: there's a million of them.

280
00:24:32,002 --> 00:24:33,549
Scott: well i mean the thing is you have it's.

281
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:33,951
Scott: it's weird.

282
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:39,919
Rym: they all have like the dragon and the guy on the cover and they have a lame title and they're just like generic stereotypical.

283
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:48,668
Scott: all right let's go he's the bad guy though a lot of those right are the kind of fantasy book where it's like a pulp shallow fantasy.

284
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:49,170
Scott: it's pretty much.

285
00:24:49,752 --> 00:24:50,876
Scott: i'm on an adventure.

286
00:24:50,996 --> 00:24:52,943
Scott: the evil wizard captured the maiden.

287
00:24:52,963 --> 00:24:57,438
Scott: i will go save him the dragon's defending his castle slaying slaying slaying.

288
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:00,528
Scott: oh no but i am fought i am fought back by magic.

289
00:25:00,588 --> 00:25:02,495
Scott: aha but i come back and i save the day.

290
00:25:02,515 --> 00:25:03,198
Rym: hurrah of course.

291
00:25:03,218 --> 00:25:04,624
Rym: then there's the extra special.

292
00:25:05,085 --> 00:25:10,703
Rym: you have a licensed franchise like the uh forgotten realm.

293
00:25:10,783 --> 00:25:11,786
Scott: are the dragon lands?

294
00:25:11,846 --> 00:25:15,901
Rym: good god those dragon legs book oh god those are some of the worst books ever.

295
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:17,167
Scott: there's a there's a lot of those.

296
00:25:17,388 --> 00:25:18,573
Scott: the thing is not every.

297
00:25:18,774 --> 00:25:18,874
Scott: it's.

298
00:25:19,115 --> 00:25:22,590
Scott: it's hard to tell by the cover like which ones are the quality and which ones are not.

299
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,799
Scott: sort of like the same thing with science fiction.

300
00:25:24,819 --> 00:25:37,763
Scott: you have the pulp science fiction like i'm in a rocket making having sex with aliens and shooting robots and then you have the other ones that are wow this is hardcore like isaac asimov sci-fi heinlein.

301
00:25:38,064 --> 00:25:41,014
Rym: yeah heinlein type the way i've been able to do.

302
00:25:41,034 --> 00:25:48,661
Rym: well the one way to tell good fantasy books is to look for ones that don't have pictures on the cover and possibly are hardcover and large.

303
00:25:48,721 --> 00:25:51,892
Scott: look for ones that have hugo and nebulae award winnings.

304
00:25:52,173 --> 00:25:54,580
Rym: but there's a much much easier way.

305
00:25:54,861 --> 00:26:05,885
Rym: you see there's a man named alex and what you want to do is say alex i want to read a fantasy book that doesn't suck and he would give you one because pretty much that is how i found out about the prince of nothing.

306
00:26:06,127 --> 00:26:07,473
Rym: what other people were talking about.

307
00:26:07,493 --> 00:26:08,801
Rym: i was like alex give me a fantasy book.

308
00:26:08,841 --> 00:26:10,993
Rym: he was like here you go this is one of the best.

309
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,583
Rym: yep i read it like right away.

310
00:26:13,603 --> 00:26:14,868
Rym: and i was like so there's more right.

311
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:15,632
Rym: and he gave me the other two.

312
00:26:15,652 --> 00:26:22,580
Scott: and everyone constantly said scott read these books scott read these books and like everything else everyone tells me to read watch look at listen to.

313
00:26:22,921 --> 00:26:28,542
Scott: i say i will later after i get through all the things that you told me to watch read listen to.

314
00:26:28,602 --> 00:26:42,935
Rym: before the thing that the result here is that some people in the crew had read these books some time ago and then they would talk about these books and then other people in the crew had not read them would be like what's the thing you're talking about?

315
00:26:43,156 --> 00:26:59,681
Rym: and then they'd go and give you the books and make you read them and then every time more people read them there were like these there was the first wave and then like four aftershocks because every time another group of the front row crew read these books suddenly everyone would be talking about them again.

316
00:26:59,882 --> 00:27:03,156
Scott: maybe that's the thing like if we all read the book at the same time.

317
00:27:03,337 --> 00:27:10,427
Scott: right maybe the excitement about the book won't last because we'll all be really excited about all at once and then we'll all forget about it together.

318
00:27:10,728 --> 00:27:27,695
Scott: but if we if one person reads it then another person then another brand we pass the book around then each time someone reads it the excitement throughout the entire group will be reinvigorated because causing the excitement to last longer and actually the total enjoyment of the book to be increased.

319
00:27:27,735 --> 00:27:27,896
Scott: because

320
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:45,622
Rym: i've seen the same thing happen with other things before especially with anime where i watch an anime all right but then knowing that someone else who had not seen it has just watched it and then having a conversation with them it's like i can almost relive vicariously through them the first reading i had or the first watching

321
00:27:45,722 --> 00:27:46,003
Scott: i had.

322
00:27:46,024 --> 00:27:50,641
Scott: yeah it's like as awesome as it is watch cowboy vbop infinity times which i could definitely do.

323
00:27:51,143 --> 00:27:55,560
Scott: it's even more awesome to when there's someone watching it with you who hasn't seen it.

324
00:27:55,621 --> 00:27:59,618
Scott: it's like if i had even if i've seen like attack the gas station is the perfect example.

325
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,184
Scott: attack the gas station.

326
00:28:01,244 --> 00:28:03,474
Scott: i've seen it enough times you know and it's good.

327
00:28:03,554 --> 00:28:08,133
Scott: but i've seen enough times where watching it again on my own is not going to be that enjoyable.

328
00:28:08,294 --> 00:28:22,937
Rym: yeah the blues brothers i've seen that movie possibly more than any other two-dimensional media ever when i was a kid when i'm when i say i was a kid i'm talking when i was like four i would.

329
00:28:22,957 --> 00:28:24,823
Rym: i had these little cars.

330
00:28:25,144 --> 00:28:37,939
Rym: i guess they were kind of big but they're plastic cars and i would watch the blues brothers and every time there was a car scene me and my little brother would run around the house with these cars reenacting and yelling and screaming and crashing them and then we'd watch the next part.

331
00:28:38,662 --> 00:28:40,007
Rym: oh god i love the blues brothers.

332
00:28:40,268 --> 00:28:58,276
Scott: it's a good one but yeah um so yeah it's like if i have even if there's even one person with me who has not yet seen like the attack the gas station it's suddenly worth it to like watch the whole movie again just to watch their reaction to it.

333
00:28:58,296 --> 00:29:06,123
Scott: i don't know what it is about that but it's like watching someone enjoy something that you might you know be sort of bored with.

334
00:29:06,725 --> 00:29:08,932
Scott: suddenly like makes the whole thing new again.

335
00:29:08,952 --> 00:29:11,902
Scott: i don't know how that works or why but it does so.

336
00:29:11,942 --> 00:29:12,063
Scott: it's.

337
00:29:12,223 --> 00:29:12,905
Scott: it's pretty cool.

338
00:29:13,206 --> 00:29:23,327
Rym: so as a result we keep having these aftershocks and even now now that there's all this excitement again we've suddenly as a group lent these books to yet another wave of front row crew

339
00:29:23,448 --> 00:29:28,750
Scott: i mean because suddenly you know i went out and bought all three books and Rym bought a hardcover the first book.

340
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,775
Rym: that smells like locks.

341
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:30,900
Scott: yeah yeah we're just.

342
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,611
Scott: you know buddy used and we're just like passing copies out.

343
00:29:33,652 --> 00:29:39,878
Scott: like everybody passed the books around and alex is like well i've got to reread those because he read them longer than anybody.

344
00:29:39,938 --> 00:29:42,209
Rym: i want to reread them but all the copies are lent out.

345
00:29:42,811 --> 00:29:45,519
Scott: uh i got books two and three that's not not lent out.

346
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:49,390
Rym: yeah uh so i what makes these books good?

347
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:54,612
Rym: i mean we gotta convince you to read them and you do want to read these books because i think i figured it out.

348
00:29:54,632 --> 00:30:03,190
Rym: i know how we're gonna do this all right when we do the round table we'll we'll make note ahead of time because i kind of kind of forget exactly where each book begins and ends.

349
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:07,526
Rym: but we'll kind of demarcate it and we'll talk about just the first book.

350
00:30:08,008 --> 00:30:11,420
Rym: then we'll do the spoiler line and bring up the second book.

351
00:30:11,902 --> 00:30:14,271
Rym: then we'll do the spoiler line and bring up the third book.

352
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:18,126
Scott: yeah i'm really thinking we should just do book one for the thing.

353
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:19,170
Scott: but we'll figure it out.

354
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:28,743
Scott: i'll put links uh to all three of the books in our in our episode you will not be risking much by buying all three instead of just the first one like to.

355
00:30:28,944 --> 00:30:35,023
Scott: oh and i think what we should do also is i really want to emphasize because it's kind of scary.

356
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:39,094
Scott: there are people who don't read like you know.

357
00:30:39,114 --> 00:30:43,853
Scott: they'll read a comic and they'll read a newspaper or magazine but they don't read books.

358
00:30:44,435 --> 00:30:44,757
Scott: it's like.

359
00:30:44,837 --> 00:30:51,710
Scott: it's not always that they're stupid even though i you know i could say someone doesn't read it super but reading is sort of gone out of favor with a lot of people.

360
00:30:51,931 --> 00:30:53,015
Rym: what i think.

361
00:30:53,055 --> 00:30:56,670
Rym: marjorie said it best those who can't read and those who don't read are the same.

362
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:00,481
Scott: yes everyone listen to this podcast right?

363
00:31:00,521 --> 00:31:01,705
Scott: you think this podcast.

364
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:03,029
Scott: we're not geniuses.

365
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:03,992
Scott: this isn't the highest.

366
00:31:04,032 --> 00:31:05,637
Rym: well one of us isn't a genius.

367
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:07,462
Rym: i think we both know which one right.

368
00:31:07,864 --> 00:31:12,458
Scott: uh so this isn't you know the highest brow thing in the world.

369
00:31:12,498 --> 00:31:13,261
Scott: we're not like.

370
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:22,229
Scott: you know one of those like high brow pbs news shows or anything right but we're higher brow than i think the average level of pop.

371
00:31:22,249 --> 00:31:35,310
Scott: you know popular television entertainment if you're listening to our relatively high brow entertainment and you consider yourself like a respectable high brow more intellectual than the average person.

372
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,254
Scott: you gotta be reading.

373
00:31:37,274 --> 00:31:41,589
Scott: i mean if you're not reading at least a fantasy book i got a fantasy book.

374
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:44,547
Rym: i remember when i was a little kid and i'd be encountered with people like that.

375
00:31:44,587 --> 00:31:45,855
Rym: i just figured yeah kids are stupid.

376
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:46,518
Rym: and then i got to.

377
00:31:46,659 --> 00:31:49,392
Rym: you know high school and college and i never ran into those people again.

378
00:31:49,452 --> 00:31:55,709
Rym: but there was one time i was out for a walk with a bunch of friends.

379
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:56,571
Scott: i was not there.

380
00:31:56,872 --> 00:32:05,886
Rym: yeah it was me and a girl i liked at the time and a guy who's uh really cool i actually realized now i haven't talked to in a long time and i kind of missed that guy.

381
00:32:05,986 --> 00:32:07,072
Scott: i chat him up once in a while.

382
00:32:07,193 --> 00:32:08,420
Rym: i haven't chatted up in a while.

383
00:32:08,621 --> 00:32:12,622
Scott: i'm gonna chat him up pretty soon because i got a co-worker who's moving out to boston and he's out in boston.

384
00:32:12,763 --> 00:32:17,524
Rym: well we all went off for a walk and it was this nice time in rochester like in the early days also a lame guy there.

385
00:32:18,026 --> 00:32:22,927
Rym: well yeah but we're walking and we're talking and this is like this four hour long epic walk.

386
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:32,220
Rym: and we're talking about politics we're talking about the world and philosophy and everything and one guy who's who shall not be named again was walking along.

387
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:38,618
Rym: yes hence again he was kind of quiet most of the time and he's not a really quiet person.

388
00:32:38,678 --> 00:32:44,801
Scott: generally you know i mean he's not like you know super friendly but he's not like one of those really shy quiet people.

389
00:32:44,942 --> 00:32:55,008
Rym: and usually when the crew was together like the epic crew when we'd fill our tiny apartment with people and it was so loud and everyone's talking and yelling it was crazy and it was just a kind of small more intimate group.

390
00:32:55,028 --> 00:32:59,582
Rym: we're out walking and we're talking and he's really quiet.

391
00:32:59,984 --> 00:33:05,548
Rym: and finally we get talking about books and we start talking about science fiction books and we're going on and on and on.

392
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:12,077
Rym: then we get into the classics and i think we got to the point where we're talking about the Iliad and whether or not it was actually worth reading and then

393
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:14,083
Scott: out of the blue it's a tough one

394
00:33:14,404 --> 00:33:22,224
Rym: he kind of pipes up and says i feel stupid and we're like oh come on enter the conversation.

395
00:33:22,264 --> 00:33:22,686
Rym: what's up?

396
00:33:22,947 --> 00:33:24,051
Rym: what books do you like to read?

397
00:33:24,473 --> 00:33:26,621
Rym: he's like ah i just have nothing to say to you guys.

398
00:33:26,862 --> 00:33:29,112
Rym: all right well what's a book you've read recently?

399
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:29,976
Rym: we'll talk about that.

400
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,082
Rym: you know we'll bring you in.

401
00:33:31,123 --> 00:33:31,505
Rym: we want to.

402
00:33:31,947 --> 00:33:32,791
Rym: i know we're talking about things.

403
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:34,701
Scott: we've been walking with you for how many hours.

404
00:33:34,741 --> 00:33:35,726
Scott: why are you not?

405
00:33:35,987 --> 00:33:38,878
Rym: we want you to say and he says i don't really read books.

406
00:33:39,461 --> 00:33:39,942
Rym: what do you mean?

407
00:33:39,962 --> 00:33:40,524
Rym: i don't know.

408
00:33:40,565 --> 00:33:42,712
Rym: i just i don't like reading books.

409
00:33:43,374 --> 00:33:49,897
Rym: and then there was this long pause as we all kind of stopped walking and stared at him like what do you mean you don't read books.

410
00:33:50,379 --> 00:33:52,891
Rym: well i mean i'm kind of forced to for school and all that.

411
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:59,229
Rym: but i just i really just don't like reading and i didn't know what to say to that.

412
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:04,184
Scott: that's like someone's coming up to you and saying i want to be illiterate.

413
00:34:05,367 --> 00:34:06,471
Rym: i really didn't know what to do.

414
00:34:06,531 --> 00:34:07,755
Rym: it was like all right.

415
00:34:08,558 --> 00:34:10,384
Rym: i have very little to say to you now.

416
00:34:10,866 --> 00:34:16,667
Scott: yeah i mean we're gonna go nothing to say to us but now there's no reason for me to even associate with you.

417
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:17,551
Rym: it's like all right.

418
00:34:17,591 --> 00:34:17,891
Rym: there's this.

419
00:34:17,911 --> 00:34:20,280
Rym: uh i'm gonna go back to talking about the alien.

420
00:34:20,701 --> 00:34:21,121
Rym: you can.

421
00:34:21,342 --> 00:34:22,647
Scott: uh you can walk.

422
00:34:22,888 --> 00:34:29,742
Scott: i guess yeah um read read a book read a book read a book.

423
00:34:30,163 --> 00:34:31,065
Scott: so we're gonna.

424
00:34:31,085 --> 00:34:34,060
Scott: we're gonna emphasize reading because i don't think we've been doing that enough.

425
00:34:34,482 --> 00:34:38,303
Scott: we're gonna emphasize reading fun yet also awesome books.

426
00:34:38,322 --> 00:34:39,065
Scott: i think that's what we need to do.

427
00:34:39,106 --> 00:34:45,447
Scott: we need to pick books that are both fun and geeky but also with the intellectual high brownness.

428
00:34:45,748 --> 00:34:46,931
Scott: we need to get that combo.

429
00:34:47,033 --> 00:34:51,672
Rym: let's finish this up because i'm kind of hungry i'm kind of tired and this show is such a cop out.

430
00:34:51,752 --> 00:34:55,666
Rym: i promise the next uh lounge will be rocking and awesome.

431
00:34:55,706 --> 00:34:56,027
Rym: i got.

432
00:34:56,047 --> 00:34:58,357
Scott: oh you better prepare something in advance because i got nothing.

433
00:34:58,578 --> 00:35:00,365
Rym: i got something don't worry don't worry.

434
00:35:00,706 --> 00:35:04,681
Rym: but i got to sell to you the prince of nothing books so that you'll read them.

435
00:35:05,243 --> 00:35:06,428
Rym: so here's the deal.

436
00:35:06,488 --> 00:35:08,114
Scott: we told you to have we been wrong?

437
00:35:08,134 --> 00:35:09,238
Rym: i have excellent judgment.

438
00:35:09,278 --> 00:35:10,924
Rym: i just proved it anyway.

439
00:35:11,365 --> 00:35:12,048
Rym: it's a trilogy.

440
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:20,812
Rym: it consists of three books the darkness that comes before oh my god the warrior prophet and the thousand fold thought.

441
00:35:20,913 --> 00:35:28,719
Rym: now these are the prince of nothing trilogy written by a canadian author r scott backer for whom i have respect.

442
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:32,952
Scott: that is undying r scott backer's credentials about his philosophy degrees.

443
00:35:32,972 --> 00:35:34,557
Rym: his doctor is doctor.

444
00:35:34,577 --> 00:35:36,884
Rym: he is a doctor of philosophy.

445
00:35:37,085 --> 00:35:38,309
Scott: is he a doctor of philosophy?

446
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:38,991
Scott: i'm the unknown thing.

447
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:39,715
Scott: that's exactly.

448
00:35:39,796 --> 00:35:44,276
Rym: r scott backer a canadian fantasy author he grew up on a tobacco farm in the simcoe area.

449
00:35:44,718 --> 00:35:51,861
Rym: in 1986. he attended the university of western ontario to pursue a degree in literature and later a master's in theory and criticism.

450
00:35:52,383 --> 00:36:06,633
Rym: after new oh after nearly completing but ultimately abandoning his phd in philosophy at vanderbilt opting instead to devote himself to the craft of literature rather than the crap of academia he moved on to london ontario where he now lives with his wife.

451
00:36:06,733 --> 00:36:07,876
Rym: i read that from wikipedia.

452
00:36:07,897 --> 00:36:09,461
Scott: yeah that's fine.

453
00:36:09,482 --> 00:36:11,628
Rym: now uh he is completed.

454
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:15,863
Rym: he has also completed a science fiction thriller entitled neuropath.

455
00:36:16,144 --> 00:36:18,131
Rym: why don't we get that hopes to publish in 2008?

456
00:36:18,131 --> 00:36:20,561
Scott: oh that's why we don't get that now.

457
00:36:21,043 --> 00:36:22,930
Rym: here's what i want to say about the prince of nothing.

458
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,715
Rym: here's how i will sell this to you.

459
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:34,728
Rym: if you like high fantasy but are disappointed by the fact i mean we'll say like the kinds of people that will like this book you like high fantasy.

460
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:38,622
Rym: you are disappointed that most high fantasy is pulpy crap.

461
00:36:38,722 --> 00:36:45,547
Scott: it's like you want books with lots of wizards and crazy magic and wicked dragons and crazy knights stabbing each other.

462
00:36:45,567 --> 00:36:47,154
Rym: but you don't want them to be stupid.

463
00:36:47,194 --> 00:36:51,553
Scott: you don't want them to be shallow and lame of just haha i'm saving the day i'm the hero.

464
00:36:51,593 --> 00:37:00,384
Scott: you want them to actually be intellectually deep and have meanings and messages and metaphors and analogies and all that good literary stuff.

465
00:37:00,966 --> 00:37:01,728
Scott: this is that book.

466
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:13,459
Rym: if you enjoyed the idea of the silmarillion but did not enjoy reading the silmarillion i think you know you like everything about it except actually reading it.

467
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:29,570
Scott: if you like those really hard sci-fi novels but you just wish you could replace the spaceships with horses and replace the laser guns with swords and replace you know such replace the bigs big spaceships with siege engines.

468
00:37:30,231 --> 00:37:30,952
Scott: that's this book.

469
00:37:31,674 --> 00:37:43,661
Rym: if you want a fantasy book that is gritty realistic like the level of grittiness and this is not a happy fantasy world this is not.

470
00:37:43,701 --> 00:37:48,601
Rym: the emily says this lot like yeah the middle ages are great if you don't think about the reality.

471
00:37:48,902 --> 00:37:50,852
Rym: where do you think people pooped in the middle ages?

472
00:37:51,534 --> 00:37:53,080
Rym: how long do you think they showered?

473
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,184
Scott: yeah this this book.

474
00:37:54,244 --> 00:37:55,890
Rym: really nights were not clean people.

475
00:37:56,171 --> 00:37:58,700
Scott: this book really throws you it doesn't you know?

476
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,908
Scott: put that glossy shine on the middle ages.

477
00:38:00,968 --> 00:38:12,708
Scott: yes this is a dirty and filthy and disgusting and unclean and you're down in the dirt with the peasants and even the the big kings and princes are down in the dirt with the peasants.

478
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,555
Scott: and really oh it's good stuff.

479
00:38:14,635 --> 00:38:18,549
Rym: i mean if it if you want a fantasy book that is it is fantasy.

480
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:22,201
Rym: there is magic but it's realistic to the point.

481
00:38:22,221 --> 00:38:23,565
Scott: realistic magic it is.

482
00:38:23,666 --> 00:38:24,669
Scott: it's self-consistent with.

483
00:38:24,709 --> 00:38:33,639
Rym: it is self-consistent and the worldview presented and the world you were immersed in is very realistic even with the magic you'd be surprised.

484
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:38,116
Scott: yeah it makes sense within the context of itself even though it's impossible in the real world.

485
00:38:38,217 --> 00:38:45,179
Scott: well some of it yes and it takes you know real world viewpoints and then sort of it's sort of like.

486
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:54,828
Scott: what would it be like for someone you know who thinks like a person in the in this natural world in the fantasy world and it's it's good stuff.

487
00:38:55,048 --> 00:39:00,068
Scott: now beyond that well i mean how many times have i said good stuff it's good but i mean other kinds of.

488
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:31,770
Rym: if you're reading this if you're intrigued by the idea of a fantasy book that takes kind of the fundamental questions of philosophy and existentialism and basically embodies them in the thoughts and actions of not only characters but nations and cultures and basically create situations where these ideologies will in the real world come into immediate conflict with each other just to see which ones win and why this book is up your.

489
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:36,402
Scott: yeah also this book doesn't just answer questions of like philosophy.

490
00:39:36,422 --> 00:39:42,624
Scott: it like it doesn't it like questions like the fundamental laws of physics in the universe.

491
00:39:42,644 --> 00:39:45,173
Rym: it questions the fundamental nature of morality.

492
00:39:45,193 --> 00:39:47,579
Rym: yeah and not even that motive.

493
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,708
Rym: yeah motive causality and it does it.

494
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:53,035
Scott: causality is pretty much the central theme of the book.

495
00:39:53,256 --> 00:39:56,849
Rym: yes well especially this isn't a spoiler by any stretch.

496
00:39:56,889 --> 00:40:00,205
Rym: but the title of the first book is the darkness that comes before.

497
00:40:00,246 --> 00:40:08,476
Rym: and there's a point in the book when the dark pretty early on actually the darkness that comes before is explained to you in no uncertain terms.

498
00:40:08,757 --> 00:40:20,902
Scott: and yeah because i mean you hear the title the darkness that comes before and you think oh well this book is probably just about like you know the big evil bad guys looming up and then in the next book like they come on strong right.

499
00:40:21,022 --> 00:40:24,133
Scott: so this is like you know the building up of the big bad guys.

500
00:40:24,976 --> 00:40:27,224
Rym: no not at all to express to you.

501
00:40:27,364 --> 00:40:31,807
Rym: that's not what the darkness that comes before means because i remember when scott he got the book he didn't even read it.

502
00:40:31,827 --> 00:40:33,896
Rym: yet he's like darkness that comes before.

503
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:35,120
Rym: i know what this is about.

504
00:40:35,442 --> 00:40:37,309
Rym: and then later he's like oh okay wow.

505
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:46,660
Scott: and now if i say comes before that has a completely different meaning from what it means to most people haven't read this book and especially like this is a book.

506
00:40:47,423 --> 00:40:53,023
Rym: ram i'm coming before you i don't know i don't think you've come before me yet uh-huh.

507
00:40:53,204 --> 00:41:03,159
Rym: so yeah that's what i want you to think but especially when this is a book that will introduce concepts and ideas and things like that and you'll understand them you will understand them.

508
00:41:03,179 --> 00:41:09,500
Rym: this is what then and later on you i guess you won't have understood the full ramifications.

509
00:41:09,841 --> 00:41:14,801
Scott: yep this is actually you know usually i read a book and a book might present me with.

510
00:41:14,841 --> 00:41:24,195
Scott: you know things to think about but they're like they're not new things to think about mostly because i've read books before that explored similar intellectual questions.

511
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:25,802
Rym: the zebra storyteller problem of.

512
00:41:26,124 --> 00:41:28,234
Rym: i've read a book that's like like evangelion.

513
00:41:28,254 --> 00:41:28,977
Rym: you watch ava.

514
00:41:28,997 --> 00:41:29,681
Rym: it's like all right.

515
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:31,228
Rym: it brought up all these interesting ideas.

516
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:44,392
Rym: but at the same time if you've studied psychology and some in certain other fields of interest then all the ideas presented in ava are not very new and they're not necessarily handled in a interesting or new way.

517
00:41:44,412 --> 00:41:50,599
Rym: it's like it's a good introduction but if you've already read a book not so much yeah like if i've watched battle royale.

518
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:52,227
Scott: right and battle royale is a good movie.

519
00:41:52,247 --> 00:42:00,440
Scott: i haven't read the book but it didn't really have anything new for me to think about because i had already read lord of the flies and it basically britain lord of the flies too.

520
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:08,790
Rym: it brings up a cut like a few really interesting like ideas and i and you don't know what the answer is and it kind of explores the.

521
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:15,477
Rym: it kind of sets up a situation to explore these ideas and see like from where morality and humanity and all these things really derive.

522
00:42:15,698 --> 00:42:21,438
Rym: yep but once you've explored those ideas it's really difficult to find something that explores them deeper.

523
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:28,343
Scott: so the prince of nothing explores ideas and things that i might have thought about in the world.

524
00:42:28,443 --> 00:42:31,092
Scott: some of them and you know some of them i might have read about.

525
00:42:31,112 --> 00:42:37,994
Scott: but it goes places that other books did not go or places my brain had not previously gone.

526
00:42:38,054 --> 00:42:40,282
Rym: it hits you over the head with what are you?

527
00:42:40,383 --> 00:42:41,888
Rym: no really what are you?

528
00:42:41,969 --> 00:42:43,736
Rym: and you think all right i've thought about that before.

529
00:42:44,077 --> 00:42:48,352
Rym: but then it presents for you a world where that question what are you?

530
00:42:48,372 --> 00:42:49,955
Rym: is inescapable.

531
00:42:50,136 --> 00:42:51,157
Scott: what do you see?

532
00:42:51,178 --> 00:42:52,119
Scott: what do you say?

533
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,582
Scott: what do you see what am i?

534
00:42:53,963 --> 00:42:57,991
Scott: what do you say?

535
00:42:58,753 --> 00:42:59,976
Rym: uh you know.

536
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:03,564
Rym: uh these books are so good it's real good.

537
00:43:04,005 --> 00:43:06,030
Scott: so a month from now what date you say?

538
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:08,057
Rym: that was i said june 5th.

539
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:12,772
Scott: june 5th is going to be an episode of GeekNights where we will do two things.

540
00:43:13,073 --> 00:43:30,283
Scott: one we will do sort of a non-spoiler review of the book that we're going to fully review in july and we're going to do a group sort of book club maybe with skype maybe in person maybe a combo of the two about the prince of nothing.

541
00:43:30,324 --> 00:43:32,692
Scott: at least the first book read all three if you can.

542
00:43:32,753 --> 00:43:39,298
Rym: yes because in the very least i i don't know if we're gonna do three separate shows though i feel like they'd almost be warranted.

543
00:43:39,318 --> 00:43:47,974
Scott: see i don't think i. i really actually and if we do when we do the final thoughts book club on it a month from now really there's not going to be much plot talking.

544
00:43:48,014 --> 00:43:52,490
Scott: it's mostly going to be talking about like you know the themes and the characters mostly.

545
00:43:53,510 --> 00:44:08,093
Rym: yeah i i really think if nothing else we're probably going to talk a lot about because i the reason i said you know we should break it up into three different like spoiler lines is that we can bring up concepts and questions and scenes that mean something

546
00:44:08,514 --> 00:44:08,655
Scott: but

547
00:44:08,836 --> 00:44:12,992
Rym: they mean something completely different after you pass the spoiler line of the next book.

548
00:44:13,313 --> 00:44:20,001
Rym: yeah because new context like you see a scene or a flashback and you think oh the great war of ancient past.

549
00:44:20,403 --> 00:44:25,946
Rym: and then after the second book you think oh the great war of ancient past.

550
00:44:26,066 --> 00:44:29,092
Rym: and then the third book you think heron spear.

551
00:44:29,574 --> 00:44:34,306
Rym: ah the heron spear nagika heron spear nagika mogg furrow.

552
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:37,095
Scott: it's mogg furrow desert punk desert.

553
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:39,041
Scott: god let's let's stop.

554
00:44:39,061 --> 00:44:43,898
Scott: so at the very least before we go every all the podcasts learn to stop stealing dave and joel's jokes.

555
00:44:43,918 --> 00:44:47,029
Scott: until now that's actually a really good joke dave.

556
00:44:47,069 --> 00:44:48,577
Rym: yeah dave that is like the bet.

557
00:44:48,999 --> 00:44:49,361
Scott: i really.

558
00:44:49,381 --> 00:44:51,149
Scott: i actually think that's really funny when you do that.

559
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:51,833
Scott: so keep doing it.

560
00:44:52,054 --> 00:44:53,883
Rym: i don't think you understand how often we do that.

561
00:44:53,943 --> 00:44:56,795
Rym: now unreal it's the kind of you know when there's an inside joke.

562
00:44:56,835 --> 00:44:59,765
Rym: that's so inside that it loses its context.

563
00:44:59,806 --> 00:45:03,417
Rym: duality to where unrelated to the current conversation.

564
00:45:03,478 --> 00:45:11,699
Rym: someone will suddenly say nagika yeah desert punk friends or nothing.

565
00:45:11,819 --> 00:45:13,462
Scott: read it read the book.

566
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:14,765
Rym: if that didn't sell you on it.

567
00:45:15,507 --> 00:45:20,704
Rym: here is the kind of plot synopsis of how these books begin and an idea of where they're going.

568
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:22,250
Scott: you can do a plot synopsis.

569
00:45:22,631 --> 00:45:23,053
Scott: watch out.

570
00:45:23,294 --> 00:45:27,890
Scott: so you're gonna do the shallow plot synopsis here in the ancient ancient time.

571
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:29,999
Rym: but think about this two thousand years ago.

572
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:30,843
Rym: think about this.

573
00:45:30,923 --> 00:45:31,104
Rym: in the.

574
00:45:31,164 --> 00:45:41,700
Rym: in the way i'm describing this you might not get the writing style which by the way these books are written amazingly like the the the diction and the prose.

575
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:46,938
Rym: he what was the line he entered the circle described by his sword?

576
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:48,644
Scott: no i don't think that was.

577
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,873
Rym: that was a good one but there were much better ones than that.

578
00:45:51,134 --> 00:45:52,480
Scott: did it our scott packers?

579
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,248
Scott: way smarter than either of us that's for sure.

580
00:45:54,429 --> 00:45:56,597
Rym: his writing is is wonderful.

581
00:45:56,898 --> 00:46:03,863
Rym: but you should make a blog thinking if you haven't read other high fantasy think in terms of tolkin in terms of like taking these ideas.

582
00:46:03,923 --> 00:46:05,689
Rym: but they are presented properly.

583
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:08,318
Rym: they are not done in a cheesy way or a pulpy way.

584
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:21,663
Rym: but basically we are presented with this kind of prologue of there is an ancient war and it will present in real time like ancient long time ago ancient times two thousand years ago exactly the no god rose.

585
00:46:21,943 --> 00:46:26,802
Rym: there was a plague upon the world the horrible war between existence and non-existence.

586
00:46:26,822 --> 00:46:31,281
Scott: it's pretty much the end of the world like this horrible war that like ruined all of civilization.

587
00:46:31,301 --> 00:46:33,469
Rym: the end of the world happened the high times.

588
00:46:33,509 --> 00:46:38,284
Rym: the ancient high fantasy world is destroyed by this this entity.

589
00:46:38,685 --> 00:46:48,897
Rym: and when we talk about an entity i mean this is an entity where it was born unto the world and every living being in the womb of every mother was still born in that instance.

590
00:46:49,259 --> 00:46:53,512
Scott: until for as long as the evil thing existed and no children were born.

591
00:46:53,532 --> 00:47:04,786
Rym: tense yeah and wars armies of horrible beings descended from the north upon the greatest civilizations of the world that banded together attempting to fight them off.

592
00:47:04,806 --> 00:47:07,396
Scott: yep so the apocalypse happened two thousand years ago.

593
00:47:07,416 --> 00:47:13,880
Scott: so it happened and one king and his little kingdom of people went to their castle in the middle of nowhere.

594
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,045
Rym: these are the high kings.

595
00:47:15,266 --> 00:47:15,968
Rym: who is basically?

596
00:47:16,009 --> 00:47:17,494
Rym: yeah what the kunarik high king?

597
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:22,251
Scott: yeah it's like the king of kings like king arthur like the kingiest king there was.

598
00:47:23,314 --> 00:47:25,922
Rym: these are like uh the kings of gondor.

599
00:47:26,082 --> 00:47:34,514
Rym: right the guys had the big colossi of imaginative instead of you know scattering to the winds whatever they did if they had a secret castle passed down through genera like.

600
00:47:34,534 --> 00:47:41,599
Rym: this was intended to be the sanctuary from the end of the world sort of like the secret base for the president under nora.

601
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:50,932
Rym: it's like if minus tereth was there but there was another minus tereth that was such a secret that no one but the ancient kings knew about it.

602
00:47:50,993 --> 00:48:00,428
Rym: the ancient kings went there two thousand years ago running away from the apocalypse and i think this is so well described and then they waited and no armies besieged their gates.

603
00:48:00,749 --> 00:48:02,355
Rym: no horrible demons came.

604
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:05,826
Rym: the world just slowly ended around them and they were left alone.

605
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:19,672
Rym: and then they struck by plague and one by one they died until all that remained was effectively the prince the prince the young incredibly young prince the young incredibly young bastard prince of one of the ancient kings.

606
00:48:19,773 --> 00:48:21,478
Rym: yep and he's alone.

607
00:48:22,341 --> 00:48:24,146
Scott: and then there's a bard who's left right.

608
00:48:24,266 --> 00:48:25,911
Rym: yeah but that's not too important.

609
00:48:25,931 --> 00:48:26,873
Scott: no it's not so.

610
00:48:26,914 --> 00:48:38,653
Rym: then the the the dunyane these monks these monks so secret so removed from the world that no one knew about basically these isolated monks that no one had ever heard of from like the far north.

611
00:48:38,693 --> 00:48:44,135
Rym: they just like they had avoided the end of the world by effectively not existing like no one knew.

612
00:48:44,155 --> 00:48:49,920
Scott: if you would have gone to pretty much anyone in civilization and said dunyane basically people would have said who who?

613
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:52,993
Scott: i don't know you're talking about because they were basically unknown.

614
00:48:53,073 --> 00:48:59,353
Scott: like imagine if there was some tribe of monks living in the like in antarctica under the ground.

615
00:48:59,635 --> 00:49:03,309
Scott: no one knows about them no one will ever know about them but for some reason we.

616
00:49:04,313 --> 00:49:08,850
Scott: they show up at this castle and the only person left in that castle is this prince.

617
00:49:09,492 --> 00:49:11,799
Rym: and these monks show up and they take this prince in.

618
00:49:11,819 --> 00:49:20,188
Rym: and these monks their philosophy very shallowly and briefly as you will learn very much about them is that everything can be controlled.

619
00:49:20,228 --> 00:49:32,045
Rym: they they internal and external they understand the world understand their own minds understand themselves to the point that they can read other human beings perfectly.

620
00:49:32,346 --> 00:49:36,040
Rym: you look they look at a human who is not one of them and they know everything.

621
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:42,284
Rym: that person's thinking not magically not through any sort of bs like that simply by the way they carry themselves.

622
00:49:42,545 --> 00:49:43,508
Scott: they they know everything.

623
00:49:43,629 --> 00:49:45,434
Scott: that's it's absolute.

624
00:49:45,755 --> 00:49:53,318
Scott: you know logic absolute information seeing everything there is to see you know being able to do anything that they can possibly do.

625
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:57,455
Rym: so they take the prince in and they the prince becomes one of them.

626
00:49:57,475 --> 00:49:58,459
Rym: fat now.

627
00:49:58,479 --> 00:50:05,222
Rym: now this is this is the important part fast forward two thousand years after shows a date and the date is two thousand years later.

628
00:50:05,864 --> 00:50:10,822
Rym: and remember that this is two thousand years later but it picks up as though it happened.

629
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:16,482
Scott: it was just one thousand years after the end of the world when the horrible evil conquered the world.

630
00:50:16,824 --> 00:50:25,593
Rym: the much much removed ancestor of this king anna surinbor kellis his greatest greatest greatest greatest greatest grandson.

631
00:50:25,794 --> 00:50:33,540
Rym: the the product of these monks and all these two thousand years of living in isolation and training he's still a monk there.

632
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:36,913
Scott: the monks are still just living in this castle that no one knows about.

633
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:52,363
Rym: after two thousand years and for reasons that become apparent later in the book the this ancestor is sent out from the monks with all of their knowledge and all of their training into the world outside to accomplish a task.

634
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,570
Rym: and there is a beautiful and remember this all takes.

635
00:50:55,071 --> 00:50:56,155
Rym: this is a few pages.

636
00:50:56,195 --> 00:50:59,685
Rym: this just sets it up and yeah this is like the prologue.

637
00:50:59,705 --> 00:51:14,449
Rym: the scene where he walks out from these monks and encounters the world outside is reminiscent though does not is not done justice by the first episode of samurai jack where he learns how to see without seeing.

638
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:16,660
Rym: that's not the first episode the first one i ever saw.

639
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:20,016
Scott: that's the best episode though i've seen that episode more than any other episode.

640
00:51:20,759 --> 00:51:23,592
Rym: i think there is one better episode the monks when they climb the mountain.

641
00:51:24,175 --> 00:51:24,878
Scott: it's an okay one.

642
00:51:25,139 --> 00:51:26,104
Rym: you've seen that one right?

643
00:51:26,144 --> 00:51:29,880
Rym: maybe the one where he climbs the mountain with the monks and he gives up i don't remember.

644
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,245
Rym: he gives up on his quest.

645
00:51:31,747 --> 00:51:33,313
Rym: all right he gives up his short.

646
00:51:33,353 --> 00:51:36,705
Rym: i'm done forget aku but anyway that is not the prince of nothing.

647
00:51:37,086 --> 00:51:43,453
Rym: but the scene is like that where the thing that was walking remembers that it is a man and it is apart from the things around it.

648
00:51:44,738 --> 00:51:49,413
Scott: and then he meets the woodcutter and doesn't he meet the non-man before he meets the woodcutter?

649
00:51:49,553 --> 00:51:52,925
Rym: oh yes the non-man i think that that's after.

650
00:51:53,226 --> 00:51:56,117
Scott: yeah i don't remember the exact order it doesn't really matter.

651
00:51:56,137 --> 00:52:02,600
Rym: let me put it this way in this world there are not elves like the tulcan elves and dwarves like the tulcan dwarves.

652
00:52:03,082 --> 00:52:05,189
Rym: there are i mean the races.

653
00:52:05,209 --> 00:52:10,007
Rym: there's the race of man there's the race of strength this abomination upon the earth.

654
00:52:10,027 --> 00:52:10,870
Scott: they're sort of orkish.

655
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:27,974
Rym: there is the race of non-men that came before men and they're imagine burning wheel elves thousands of years past to the point that they've been consumed by the grief and the insanity of their immortal lives.

656
00:52:27,994 --> 00:52:35,483
Scott: yeah i mean these are basically the non-men ruled the world thousands of years ago and then the ad the apocalypse sort of just ruined them.

657
00:52:35,503 --> 00:52:38,494
Scott: and now they basically are ruined and crazy.

658
00:52:38,515 --> 00:52:40,866
Scott: and they've been ruined and crazy for two thousand years.

659
00:52:40,986 --> 00:52:42,452
Rym: and the thing is these are.

660
00:52:42,553 --> 00:52:44,038
Rym: these are my favorite elves ever.

661
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,587
Scott: yeah i could definitely go for the non-men.

662
00:52:46,607 --> 00:52:53,631
Scott: it doesn't say they're elves it just calls them non-men all the time but they sort of fit the elvish spot the same way.

663
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:58,026
Scott: the strank are not orcs but they fit the orcish spot in the fantasy world.

664
00:52:58,167 --> 00:52:58,428
Scott: yeah.

665
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:23,745
Rym: but and from there from this humble beginning of this man walks out of this monastery sequestered away for two thousand years of generations upon generations is encountered with the world and from there we are taken into the present day of this world and there is an epic holy war being undertaken and kings of all the nations and it's that's it.

666
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:29,382
Rym: i don't want to even spoil beyond that point the where these books get from where they began.

667
00:53:29,402 --> 00:53:33,798
Rym: it is almost impossible to have expected it get where it is from where it began.

668
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:41,212
Scott: it's like you look at the map in the back of the book and you know how you look at like maps and tokian books like half the map doesn't get used and stuff like that.

669
00:53:41,273 --> 00:53:45,006
Scott: right you look at this map that map gets super used.

670
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:49,527
Scott: i was flipping back to the map constantly more than any other book ever and you know what you got to do.

671
00:53:49,547 --> 00:53:50,651
Scott: you know books with maps.

672
00:53:50,671 --> 00:53:51,755
Scott: those are dangerous books.

673
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:57,975
Rym: also books that have depictions of the actual writing of the people in the books.

674
00:53:58,175 --> 00:53:59,380
Scott: yeah you gotta watch out for those too.

675
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:00,023
Scott: those are dangerous.

676
00:54:00,364 --> 00:54:07,622
Rym: but uh to do not really say any more about the plot there's one other type of person who will like these books if you like burning wheel.

677
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:12,448
Rym: these books are so set up to be a burning wheel campaign.

678
00:54:12,929 --> 00:54:13,911
Scott: yeah pretty much the.

679
00:54:14,171 --> 00:54:21,852
Rym: every character is so strong and interesting and it it's very difficult to not become lost in these characters.

680
00:54:22,514 --> 00:54:27,808
Scott: oh yeah pretty much and i'm sure like everyone you know it's.

681
00:54:27,988 --> 00:54:36,263
Scott: it doesn't seem like there's that many characters but like you think of any person in your life after reading these books and you'll see a character in this book that's like for them.

682
00:54:36,444 --> 00:54:42,809
Rym: it's like oh that's your character yep because like i look at scott johnson it's like wow scott johnson is all about akamian.

683
00:54:42,949 --> 00:54:44,374
Scott: he's super about it.

684
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:46,961
Rym: he could also be about the priest guy.

685
00:54:46,981 --> 00:54:52,042
Rym: in the beginning i feel like he would have that person who would have been friends with akamian.

686
00:54:52,343 --> 00:54:55,615
Rym: yep of course he would have been stupid and turned to religion and Rym.

687
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:59,985
Scott: he's either the confess or maybe the proyas.

688
00:55:00,406 --> 00:55:05,022
Rym: of course the way these books were introduced to me is our friend kate.

689
00:55:05,062 --> 00:55:11,574
Rym: in the front row crew said Rym you gotta read these books because you were callous and i was like all right whatever and i read the book and i was like the fuck.

690
00:55:11,594 --> 00:55:14,462
Rym: do you think of me kate what the hell?

691
00:55:14,682 --> 00:55:18,132
Rym: yeah yeah i like proyas but he's very conflicted.

692
00:55:18,353 --> 00:55:23,652
Rym: he is very conflicted and i'm i don't think i'm con fast but or confess i think that sounds better.

693
00:55:23,994 --> 00:55:28,111
Rym: but my character in burning wheel that we're playing right now is definitely going down that path.

694
00:55:28,552 --> 00:55:31,859
Scott: yeah and i'm some sort of nayer.

695
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:38,873
Scott: ish not quite but maybe you know i also have some zinnamus action.

696
00:55:39,254 --> 00:55:41,481
Scott: i like zinnamus a lot and this is my man.

697
00:55:41,621 --> 00:55:45,734
Rym: i like everyone except sereway but i like stairway sucks.

698
00:55:45,854 --> 00:55:48,042
Rym: i like her as a character though she's.

699
00:55:48,062 --> 00:55:49,005
Scott: no i don't.

700
00:55:49,025 --> 00:55:50,571
Scott: i completely don't like her at all.

701
00:55:50,631 --> 00:55:51,815
Rym: she's a great character.

702
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:52,678
Scott: yeah great to hate.

703
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:55,587
Rym: she is my proof and she is my prize.

704
00:55:55,627 --> 00:55:56,971
Scott: no not really man.

705
00:55:57,272 --> 00:55:58,695
Scott: she's great for hating all right.

706
00:55:58,996 --> 00:56:02,625
Rym: look these books are absolutely amazing.

707
00:56:02,645 --> 00:56:05,031
Rym: i you must read these books.

708
00:56:05,332 --> 00:56:07,179
Rym: read the first one if nothing else.

709
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:11,696
Rym: i practically guarantee unless you're illiterate you will want to read the second two.

710
00:56:11,736 --> 00:56:14,890
Rym: if you're illiterate learn to read and then read these books.

711
00:56:15,352 --> 00:56:16,898
Scott: yeah all right.

712
00:56:16,938 --> 00:56:19,448
Scott: sorry sorry blind people i don't think there's a braille edition.

713
00:56:19,488 --> 00:56:21,778
Rym: i'm sorry i'm sure they're audiobooks.

714
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:22,983
Rym: okay there's got.

715
00:56:23,003 --> 00:56:24,108
Rym: there is an audiobook i'm sure.

716
00:56:24,168 --> 00:56:24,690
Scott: check audible.

717
00:56:24,991 --> 00:56:26,137
Scott: yes check it right now.

718
00:56:26,378 --> 00:56:28,548
Rym: i feel like i should buy the audiobook and then listen to it.

719
00:56:28,589 --> 00:56:29,514
Scott: well check audible right now.

720
00:56:29,574 --> 00:56:32,311
Rym: all right all right all right i'm checking audible scott say stuff while i check audible.

721
00:56:32,753 --> 00:56:33,878
Scott: uh rims checking audible.

722
00:56:34,038 --> 00:56:36,548
Scott: okay uh audible i actually think is still a rip-off.

723
00:56:36,568 --> 00:56:39,537
Scott: but if you're blind i imagine it's worth like like.

724
00:56:40,019 --> 00:56:40,961
Scott: it's like a bargain.

725
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:43,268
Scott: yeah i'm not a big fan of.

726
00:56:43,529 --> 00:56:44,955
Scott: i wonder who does the audiobooks?

727
00:56:44,975 --> 00:56:45,759
Scott: does it say like who?

728
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:46,402
Scott: who does them?

729
00:56:46,543 --> 00:56:48,432
Rym: i think there's a different like actor for each one.

730
00:56:48,452 --> 00:56:53,777
Scott: uh if they had you know what'd be cool is if you actually did different actors for all the characters and did like a full audio drama.

731
00:56:53,857 --> 00:57:00,319
Scott: the whole thing the thing is is a lot of characters thinking and there's a lot of descriptions of.

732
00:57:00,419 --> 00:57:01,383
Rym: i don't see it in here.

733
00:57:01,945 --> 00:57:04,113
Scott: uh so sad wait wait wait i looked wrong.

734
00:57:04,153 --> 00:57:06,383
Scott: let me look again and there's a lot of details like.

735
00:57:06,403 --> 00:57:12,407
Scott: i don't think this is one thing where like i tried to imagine it being a movie and it would be real.

736
00:57:12,527 --> 00:57:16,964
Scott: i don't think this is possible to translate to any other medium without basically destroying it.

737
00:57:16,985 --> 00:57:17,547
Rym: it's not in here.

738
00:57:17,788 --> 00:57:25,252
Rym: well the thing is i feel like the events of these books would make an amazing movie but they wouldn't be the books.

739
00:57:25,493 --> 00:57:26,255
Rym: no well that's the thing.

740
00:57:26,596 --> 00:57:35,685
Rym: what happens in the books in terms of just like i imagine like make a movie that was these books and it would be absolutely amazing.

741
00:57:35,766 --> 00:57:42,670
Scott: i think it could put the lord of the rings to shame easily but it would be so hard to make but it would leave out like so much.

742
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:44,962
Scott: oh no that's the thing the stuff you couldn't get it across.

743
00:57:44,982 --> 00:57:48,397
Rym: it would be a movie that would probably be in my top three movies ever like.

744
00:57:48,437 --> 00:57:49,361
Rym: if it was done correctly.

745
00:57:49,441 --> 00:57:57,067
Rym: it what happens is so cinematic but at the same time there is so much that could not be portrayed on the screen.

746
00:57:57,388 --> 00:58:00,239
Rym: i feel like they should make the movies anyway but only if like.

747
00:58:00,279 --> 00:58:04,836
Scott: remember how there's so many dreams and there's so many like people.

748
00:58:04,896 --> 00:58:06,662
Scott: just like giving people knowing looks.

749
00:58:07,063 --> 00:58:10,013
Scott: but those knowing looks like mean a lot more.

750
00:58:10,073 --> 00:58:16,536
Rym: but you can't really also what is going on in people's head like there's a scene where here i will there's.

751
00:58:16,556 --> 00:58:26,673
Rym: this is one of my favorite scenes in the first book but i don't want to spoil it but there's a scene where uh confus the nephew of the emperor of what is effectively the Byzantine empire.

752
00:58:26,693 --> 00:58:31,649
Rym: it comes back from his from a campaign that he has been successful in.

753
00:58:31,689 --> 00:58:42,349
Rym: he comes back to his nation and he is kneeling before his uncle the emperor and there's a big procession and him and his uncle are talking before the crowd and talking quietly to each other.

754
00:58:42,389 --> 00:58:52,764
Rym: so they're already these two conversations going on simultaneously the public conversation of the triumphant general returning and the emperor who is greeting him.

755
00:58:53,326 --> 00:58:59,006
Rym: but then they're kind of talking to each other quietly because there's somewhat of an adversarial relationship.

756
00:58:59,027 --> 00:59:08,613
Rym: there there's also the looks and the the interaction between the emperor and his vizier who definitely has an opinion on the whole thing.

757
00:59:09,034 --> 00:59:18,445
Rym: and then the whole time you see what is going on in the head of the nephew and what he is thinking makes that scene one of the best scenes in these books.

758
00:59:18,486 --> 00:59:24,964
Scott: yeah well another great thing about the book is that it's sort of it's told from like.

759
00:59:25,025 --> 00:59:28,916
Scott: it's a first person book but who that first person is changes.

760
00:59:28,957 --> 00:59:37,648
Scott: so like it'll be telling the book from the perspective as if you know uh a kamian was the main character and you're seeing everything through his eyes.

761
00:59:37,688 --> 00:59:40,119
Rym: every chapter is like that so it's not every chapter it's.

762
00:59:40,219 --> 00:59:41,987
Scott: and then there'll be a little horizontal line.

763
00:59:42,268 --> 00:59:46,425
Scott: oh yeah yeah and then it'll say okay now everything is from the barbarian's eyes.

764
00:59:46,445 --> 00:59:58,444
Rym: now the great thing here is that basically what you were presented with is that every narrator is an unreliable narrator but at the same time you have many many narrators.

765
00:59:58,725 --> 01:00:16,753
Rym: so like in the course of like there are these scenes where everyone is sitting around a cat like there's this group of people who sit around a campfire marching along with the holy war and you keep seeing this campfire and the people around it from all these different perspectives and every one of them casts it in a completely different light.

766
01:00:17,376 --> 01:00:24,102
Rym: yep and the book will trick you too because there's a couple times where i'm like yeah yeah yeah wait a minute god damn it he tricked me.

767
01:00:24,483 --> 01:00:26,390
Scott: i knew he's tricking me and he tricked me anyway.

768
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:27,452
Scott: are we going long here?

769
01:00:27,472 --> 01:00:28,354
Rym: i think we're done.

770
