1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,287
Rym: It's Monday, February 13th, 2012.

2
00:00:11,287 --> 00:00:12,771
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,051 --> 00:00:14,495
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,555 --> 00:00:15,939
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:19,582
Rym: Tonight, we'll blank destroy the free internet.

6
00:00:22,645 --> 00:00:23,706
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,168 --> 00:00:29,611
Rym: And the answer's no, but we'll get to that.

8
00:00:30,795 --> 00:00:36,653
Rym: So I went skiing over the weekend, and snow was kind of shitty, because it's been warm.

9
00:00:37,074 --> 00:00:39,943
Rym: So I decided, alright, I can't do my fun stuff the whole time.

10
00:00:39,963 --> 00:00:44,258
Rym: Well, it's slightly above freezing, so they couldn't make snow.

11
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,684
Rym: It's all like ice and shit.

12
00:00:45,704 --> 00:00:48,276
Rym: So I decided I'll take a lesson.

13
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:56,514
Rym: So I go over and I stand, like they line up, they have all these different icons, and you stand at the level of your ability, like what you're trying to learn next.

14
00:00:57,236 --> 00:01:04,321
Rym: So I stood at the far end of super advanced, I want to learn whatever you can teach me about the crazy bullshit on the backside of the mountain.

15
00:01:05,263 --> 00:01:12,381
Rym: And the instructors are all kind of standing there, and one of them looks up and sees me standing there, and taps another guy on the shoulder and points at me.

16
00:01:13,285 --> 00:01:15,714
Rym: And then they all start looking at me and talking and huddling.

17
00:01:16,557 --> 00:01:25,312
Rym: And then I see a paper, rock, scissors, and then this older guy comes over, because apparently nobody ever takes the advanced lessons at Hunter Mountain.

18
00:01:25,372 --> 00:01:39,810
Rym: Like, it's so rare that they were fighting over who got to do it, because it's the difference between 90 minutes of telling kids how to not fall over on the bunny slope, or jumping crazy off the back mountain doing crazy bullshit.

19
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:45,310
Scott: Right, but it's like, do these guys actually, are they actually super pros who are qualified?

20
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,188
Rym: Yes, they are certified pros.

21
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,641
Scott: Because I mean, you go to Hunter Mountain because it's close.

22
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:53,730
Scott: I mean, I don't ski, but I know that's not the awesomest, bestest mountain there is.

23
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,470
Rym: You know, it is the awesomest, bestest mountain within a day trip of New York City.

24
00:01:58,191 --> 00:02:07,249
Scott: Yeah, but as overall mountains go, it's not like it's the fucking Alps, or Vermont, or pretty good, for what it is.

25
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,729
Rym: Yeah, the top 500.

26
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,154
Rym: Yeah, there's a lot of dinky, like in Beacon, there was a place like 30 minutes from us called Thunder Ridge.

27
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,145
Rym: Thunder Ridge had like two trails.

28
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:17,830
Rym: Mount Beacon used to be a ski resort.

29
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,789
Scott: Is that like those two waterslide water parks?

30
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,508
Rym: Exactly.

31
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:21,330
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

32
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:30,370
Rym: Yeah, but no, they're like super legit pro instructors, because a lot of the race teams like practice at Hunter, and then they go compete all over elsewhere, and all this stuff.

33
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,290
Rym: But this was a real lesson, and it was difficult, and it was fun.

34
00:02:34,712 --> 00:02:36,663
Scott: Yeah, they had the same shit at like golf courses.

35
00:02:36,683 --> 00:02:37,789
Scott: You get the pro, whatever.

36
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:42,138
Scott: Anyway, so I gotta read you this email I just got at 5.18 PM.

37
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,803
Scott: "Dear lottery registrant,

38
00:02:46,828 --> 00:02:47,870
Scott: congratulations.".

39
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:48,717
Rym: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

40
00:02:48,758 --> 00:02:50,090
Rym: I think I won that same lottery.

41
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,699
Scott: You know the Powerball was $350 million, right?

42
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:54,766
Scott: "You have been selected to...".

43
00:02:56,115 --> 00:02:56,870
Scott: You know, I'm gonna read it.

44
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:57,650
Scott: You got the same email?

45
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,313
Rym: I got the same email.

46
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,276
Rym: "Participate in the 2012 TD 5 borough bike

47
00:02:59,316 --> 00:02:59,397
Rym: tour.".

48
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:03,749
Scott: Oh, dammit.

49
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,570
Rym: In fact, everyone in my office who signed up for the lottery also got it.

50
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,490
Scott: I have a feeling that there were so many prizes that everyone wins, and almost nobody loses.

51
00:03:12,951 --> 00:03:14,002
Rym: I'm pretty excited about this.

52
00:03:14,043 --> 00:03:14,629
Rym: I think it'll be fun.

53
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,478
Scott: The only thing was, it was annoying.

54
00:03:16,518 --> 00:03:19,051
Scott: It's like, "Yeah, you can't bring a camera if you're in

55
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:19,151
Scott: it.".

56
00:03:19,192 --> 00:03:21,587
Scott: And I was like, "Shit, I kind of want to take pictures of the bike

57
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:21,769
Scott: tour.".

58
00:03:22,156 --> 00:03:29,100
Scott: I'm gonna... I can't take pictures of the bike tour and tour, but I have a feeling it's not hard, because they were like, "You can bring a

59
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,543
Scott: kid.".

60
00:03:29,623 --> 00:03:30,368
Scott: And I'm like, "Oh, this is gonna be

61
00:03:30,408 --> 00:03:30,630
Scott: easy.".

62
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,072
Scott: Oh, yeah.

63
00:03:31,113 --> 00:03:34,030
Rym: They have a shortcut thing they do for people who can't do the whole thing.

64
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,647
Scott: Oh, I'm not gonna take any shortcuts, but I'm not expecting to keep up with any Lance Armstrong types.

65
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:39,353
Rym: I'm looking.

66
00:03:39,394 --> 00:03:41,569
Rym: I might just try to slip my GoPro in.

67
00:03:42,693 --> 00:03:43,158
Scott: Oh, I don't know.

68
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,169
Scott: Maybe they'll let you do that.

69
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,094
Rym: Yeah, we'll see.

70
00:03:45,254 --> 00:03:47,710
Rym: I didn't read the fullness of the rules, so I gotta go through all that.

71
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,502
Rym: I also gotta get to... I think I'm gonna use my bike.

72
00:03:50,543 --> 00:03:54,110
Scott: I'm not gonna rent a road bike, I don't think you need that bike.

73
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,190
Scott: But who knows about it?

74
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,419
Rym: But I am gonna push it.

75
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:58,050
Rym: I'm gonna try to go as fast as I can.

76
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,609
Scott: I'm gonna try to go as fast as I can.

77
00:03:59,911 --> 00:04:05,750
Rym: And more importantly, I gotta get a smaller CamelBak, because the CamelBak I got is like...

78
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:07,309
Scott: I think I might not even wear it, right?

79
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,950
Scott: It's because you can just grab waters on the way, because you get services.

80
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,949
Rym: We could just get away with having one water bottle.

81
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,769
Scott: We just need someone to be in the park or at the end or something with our shit, like your wallet.

82
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,790
Scott: Well, I guess you got to bring your wallet with you, but I need somebody to be there.

83
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:22,390
Rym: I'm not bringing my wallet.

84
00:04:22,491 --> 00:04:26,029
Rym: I'm bringing a $20 bill and my driver's license with a rubber band.

85
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:30,390
Scott: You need someone, you know, to have your keys and all that stuff at the end of the thing.

86
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,665
Rym: One key, rubber banded.

87
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,929
Scott: I need like three keys.

88
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,090
Scott: You get the idea.

89
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:37,870
Rym: Yeah, I get the idea.

90
00:04:38,132 --> 00:04:38,550
Scott: Your phone.

91
00:04:39,452 --> 00:04:41,510
Scott: You need someone to be there to help you who's not biking.

92
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,409
Rym: I'm bringing my phone, because I want to do a GPS track on my whole track.

93
00:04:46,793 --> 00:04:47,930
Rym: In fact, I did that when I was skiing.

94
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,270
Rym: I actually ran the GPS and got these great graphs.

95
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:51,548
Scott: Where are you gonna put it on you?

96
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:53,070
Rym: Pocket.

97
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:54,081
Scott: Yeah.

98
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,010
Scott: We'll see.

99
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:57,630
Rym: I'll put it on one of those shoulder mount things.

100
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,470
Scott: Anyway, you know, I entered that lottery exactly 15 minutes before it closed.

101
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,846
Rym: Eleven minutes for me.

102
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,690
Scott: One of my coworkers- I think it actually might have been five, I don't remember.

103
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:13,149
Rym: I was like, oh, because I didn't even know the deadline was that day until they- I didn't even know it was the thing that existed.

104
00:05:13,693 --> 00:05:14,310
Rym: I knew it existed.

105
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,249
Rym: Until you messaged me.

106
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,350
Rym: I never tried to sign up for it.

107
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,690
Rym: I messaged you because my coworker was like, oh shit, the deadline's now.

108
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:21,950
Scott: You messaged me and I was like, what is this thing?

109
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:27,068
Scott: And then I saw that the deadline was in five minutes and I was like, whatever the fuck it is, I'm signing up.

110
00:05:27,732 --> 00:05:28,108
Scott: I don't care.

111
00:05:28,952 --> 00:05:32,449
Rym: So I got a brief news, just because I gotta reiterate this.

112
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:38,290
Rym: Wi-Fi has no measurable health effects.

113
00:05:39,012 --> 00:05:41,309
Rym: Stop being weird about this.

114
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:47,510
Rym: In this case, my admonition goes to Ontario, particularly an Ontario teachers union.

115
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,690
Scott: You're admonishing admonition.

116
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:51,250
Rym: Admonishment.

117
00:05:51,437 --> 00:05:51,790
Scott: Whatever.

118
00:05:52,674 --> 00:05:52,970
Scott: Anyway.

119
00:05:53,390 --> 00:06:00,190
Rym: It is directed at you, this teachers union is trying to get Wi-Fi banned in the school because of the deleterious health effects.

120
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:00,968
Scott: That's right.

121
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,590
Scott: Wi-Fi is perfectly safe.

122
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:06,110
Scott: The only things you have to worry about are AM radio.

123
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,110
Scott: FM radio.

124
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,390
Rym: Oh my god, AM radio is the worst.

125
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,470
Scott: What about- Airplane radar, naval sonar.

126
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:20,970
Rym: So a lot of these kids, in fact a lot of the teachers, have devices in their pockets and in their pockets these devices are transmitting at orders of magnitude more power.

127
00:06:21,154 --> 00:06:21,630
Scott: Cellphones.

128
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:22,106
Scott: Yeah.

129
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:23,202
Scott: Those are all dangerous.

130
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,449
Scott: What about that- Wi-Fi is totally safe.

131
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:29,228
Rym: What about that crazy ball of fusion in the sky spewing crazy radiation.

132
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,768
Scott: I said solar radiation.

133
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:31,930
Rym: Cosmic ray.

134
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,526
Rym: The thing is, I don't need to even say why.

135
00:06:35,587 --> 00:06:36,009
Rym: this is BS.

136
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,050
Rym: Like it's ludicrous.

137
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,229
Scott: The odds are that a cosmic ray hit you today.

138
00:06:40,356 --> 00:06:40,790
Scott: Oh shit.

139
00:06:41,230 --> 00:07:00,630
Rym: In fact, once when I was at IBM and once when I was at that broker dealer on Wall Street, at both companies at one point we had an event that we could literally only describe as and in fact officially document it as a bit flip caused by a cosmic ray.

140
00:07:01,451 --> 00:07:04,110
Scott: It could have been caused by any number of things that wasn't a cosmic ray.

141
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,750
Rym: Well the thing is, bit flips are pretty rare.

142
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,065
Scott: Why didn't you have ECC?

143
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:10,787
Rym: I don't want to get into it.

144
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,122
Rym: We didn't have ECC.

145
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,401
Scott: ECC statistically protects you from 99.99% of any cosmic rays.

146
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,530
Scott: Because the odds of the cosmic rays hitting both spots simultaneously.

147
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:28,049
Rym: Back when I was working at IBM, RAM that supported ECC, there was a lot of trouble with compatibility in different motherboards and things.

148
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,029
Scott: By servers they already have it.

149
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,490
Rym: Yeah, and there were problems with that.

150
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,189
Scott: Even Apple computers already have it.

151
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,269
Scott: Yes, and back then- The expensive Mac Pro has it.

152
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,775
Rym: Scott, this was in like 2003 or 2004 maybe.

153
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,009
Scott: Even then you could have gotten it.

154
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,724
Rym: Yeah, and there were firmware issues where it wasn't compatible.

155
00:07:44,744 --> 00:07:46,089
Rym: so the ECC had to be disabled.

156
00:07:46,172 --> 00:07:46,829
Scott: Let's continue.

157
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,525
Scott: Let's just do the show about ECC instead.

158
00:07:49,112 --> 00:07:49,729
Rym: That'd be a good show.

159
00:07:50,192 --> 00:07:51,509
Rym: We could talk about the hamming too.

160
00:07:52,594 --> 00:07:53,210
Rym: Hamming algorithm.

161
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:53,829
Scott: That's all you.

162
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:54,707
Rym: Yeah, you don't know it?

163
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,207
Rym: No.

164
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:55,749
Rym: By heart?

165
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:56,073
Scott: No.

166
00:07:56,932 --> 00:07:59,670
Rym: It removes single bit errors in transmissions trivially.

167
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,050
Rym: With okay overhead.

168
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,248
Rym: The hamming code.

169
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,469
Rym: It's basically a primitive checksum.

170
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:06,929
Scott: With pigs.

171
00:08:10,052 --> 00:08:16,248
Rym: So yeah, this Ontario's teachers union is full of randy woo woo bullshit and I just wanted to point this out.

172
00:08:16,492 --> 00:08:16,730
Scott: All right.

173
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,610
Scott: So there's a lot of online edumacations going on, right?

174
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:23,990
Scott: And I mean there's many different kinds of online edumacation.

175
00:08:24,652 --> 00:08:37,850
Scott: You can take online classes which typically is there's a professor who gives you assignments via document sharing and there's a forum discussion and maybe there's video lectures and they're awful and they're just bullshit ways to get credit without actually learning anything.

176
00:08:38,832 --> 00:08:43,609
Scott: And then there's online classes like OpenCourseWare where okay we put all the course materials online, teach yourself.

177
00:08:44,753 --> 00:08:49,347
Scott: And then there's like video stuff like that Khan Academy and there's of course.

178
00:08:49,387 --> 00:08:51,830
Scott: just there isn't actually a structured class.

179
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,229
Scott: You just go on the internet and learn things which is what I do all day every day.

180
00:08:56,873 --> 00:08:59,469
Scott: But MIT has something new and this one actually looks pretty good.

181
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,890
Scott: This is MIT launches free online fully automated course.

182
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,927
Scott: It's called MITx.

183
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:17,630
Scott: And you take a course and the course is completely automated in that you take assignments, you hand them in, it grades you, it tells you what to do, it's step by step sort of thing.

184
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:27,090
Scott: And you know this thing doesn't really exist and they say that it is not watered down or any less intense than the real university program.

185
00:09:27,752 --> 00:09:32,470
Scott: So it's like the computer just is like teaching you and only you and you have to do all this work and everything.

186
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:42,750
Scott: So I'm kind of curious you know for someone to test this out and see if it's any if you actually get a certificate for completing it because it's not like you can just complete it because it's not easy.

187
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,889
Scott: You have to actually do the work.

188
00:09:45,012 --> 00:09:49,945
Scott: And the only one they have right now is an electronics course beginning in March which is real soon.

189
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,163
Rym: But I could do some electronics like.

190
00:09:53,183 --> 00:09:54,189
Rym: what level is this at?

191
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,590
Scott: It's a university level MIT electronics course.

192
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:58,534
Rym: Yeah but like electronics.

193
00:09:58,574 --> 00:10:01,090
Rym: so is this about like circuits and like flip flops?

194
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:02,610
Rym: I'm curious.

195
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:03,509
Rym: I want to do it.

196
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,930
Scott: Then you can go click on the news and you can read.

197
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,510
Rym: But I'd have to click and read.

198
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,910
Rym: I want it aggregated for me.

199
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,140
Scott: You can't click and read this.

200
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,329
Scott: how are you going to pass this course?

201
00:10:15,977 --> 00:10:16,429
Rym: You know me.

202
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:22,349
Rym: I have surprising discipline to do really useless things and yet no desire to do things that I actually need to do.

203
00:10:24,911 --> 00:10:32,889
Scott: It's going to be interesting because like if there's enough of these classes I think you know skipping college might actually be even more legitimate.

204
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:34,332
Scott: Not you know.

205
00:10:34,352 --> 00:10:37,030
Scott: the thing is though there are some online universities that don't suck.

206
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,607
Scott: I've heard things about like this Western governor's university.

207
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:42,887
Scott: it's actually supposed to be legit.

208
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,350
Rym: So I do have one more news I do want to talk about a little bit.

209
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,330
Scott: Extra news what are you doing?

210
00:10:48,570 --> 00:11:03,130
Rym: Because they're you know this is something that has come up a few times in the past and I guess I wasn't paying attention to the EU so I didn't really realize this was still kind of a thing but you might have heard the phrase right to be forgotten.

211
00:11:04,614 --> 00:11:05,289
Scott: Nope haven't heard it.

212
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:05,585
Rym: Really?

213
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:12,489
Rym: So it's the idea that and this is a Stanford Law Review article which is pretty good at explaining the whole problem.

214
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,189
Scott: Well you just said Europe though right?

215
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,000
Rym: Yeah.

216
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,606
Scott: Okay so why is it Stanford which is a U.S.

217
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:18,090
Scott: university?

218
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:23,190
Rym: The Stanford Law Review examined the legal implications of the EU's continuing bullshit.

219
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,470
Scott: So why are they learning about European law in California?

220
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,845
Rym: Because law is law and it would affect U.S.

221
00:11:30,905 --> 00:11:32,310
Rym: companies doing business in Europe.

222
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:37,329
Scott: I guess I could just see it being problematic like if I was a lawyer and I'm a U.S.

223
00:11:37,369 --> 00:11:47,043
Scott: lawyer trying to pass the bar and I'm learning so much law they're cramming it in my brain and they cram the European laws in there too and then I forget that those are the European laws and I can feel them confused.

224
00:11:47,103 --> 00:11:47,527
Scott: and then I'm like.

225
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:50,690
Scott: Better not read the Magna Carta.

226
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,274
Scott: I'll be in court.

227
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,066
Scott: I'll be like you can't do that blah blah blah law.

228
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,169
Scott: they'll be like that's a French law.

229
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:54,830
Scott: What are you going to be Scott?

230
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,090
Scott: You're going to be like well the Magna Carta states.

231
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:58,493
Scott: That's right.

232
00:11:58,533 --> 00:11:59,521
Scott: I'd be like fuck.

233
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,670
Scott: that was in the Magna Carta shit.

234
00:12:00,931 --> 00:12:01,554
Rym: I was just reading.

235
00:12:01,594 --> 00:12:02,337
Rym: I got this great book.

236
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:06,330
Rym: I was reading the laws that the Burgundians which was an empire.

237
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:07,569
Scott: Who the fuck are the Burgundians?

238
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,150
Rym: Yeah it's an empire that disappeared a whole bunch of times.

239
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:10,969
Scott: They're not from Burgundy?

240
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:13,309
Rym: Uh that's kind of where they're from or where they ended up.

241
00:12:14,091 --> 00:12:14,875
Rym: They're from somewhere.

242
00:12:14,936 --> 00:12:15,659
Rym: it's complicated.

243
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,246
Rym: I'm reading a book on it but anyway I got to read their laws and their laws were pretty funny.

244
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,380
Rym: They had a lot of laws about how much.

245
00:12:22,621 --> 00:12:23,928
Rym: basically they had a pretty good system.

246
00:12:23,988 --> 00:12:31,949
Rym: if you fucked with someone's shit you had to pay them like a number of times the value of the thing you fucked with and you had to pay a fine to the king.

247
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,224
Scott: Why to the king?

248
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:34,909
Rym: To enforce the law.

249
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,010
Scott: Dude wouldn't the king want people to do bad shit?

250
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,829
Rym: Because it would like that you get way more money.

251
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,907
Scott: It gives the king an incentive to have bad people.

252
00:12:45,051 --> 00:12:50,190
Rym: Most of the money went to the person who was wrong though these were like if you break someone's cart you owe them twelve times.

253
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,883
Scott: That also gives me an incentive to do fraud.

254
00:12:51,903 --> 00:12:52,850
Rym: we're like we're going to broke my shit.

255
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:55,809
Scott: I make it look like you broke a frame you for breaking my shit.

256
00:12:56,432 --> 00:12:59,667
Rym: I have a feeling in the middle ages the peasants didn't really get justice anyway.

257
00:12:59,707 --> 00:13:00,290
Rym: so I digress.

258
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:10,589
Rym: but anyway the idea of the right to be forgotten is that if I now don't interrupt because I know you're going to take issue with this right away say I post a picture of my dick to Facebook.

259
00:13:11,211 --> 00:13:12,644
Scott: It's on the whole internets now tough shit.

260
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:18,386
Rym: So say then I decide I don't want my Facebook account to be there anymore and I delete it.

261
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,966
Scott: Doesn't matter your dick picture is still out there because someone definitely downloaded that shit.

262
00:13:24,411 --> 00:13:31,810
Rym: Is that if I if a picture of my dick is out there and I decide I do not want this factual information about me to be available anymore on the internet.

263
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:38,416
Rym: I have the right for it to be taken down by anyone hosting it and people who don't can be fined.

264
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,130
Rym: crazy amounts of money.

265
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,869
Rym: They're talking like one or two percent of global income.

266
00:13:43,911 --> 00:13:45,883
Scott: Good luck getting anyone on that.

267
00:13:45,903 --> 00:13:46,970
Scott: that's not in your country.

268
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,158
Rym: Yeah so it's the European Union.

269
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:52,330
Rym: so they go after Google and Google can't easily just pull out of the European Union.

270
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,449
Rym: They should if this if this happens.

271
00:13:56,073 --> 00:13:57,690
Scott: Oh so this isn't a thing they have already.

272
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,377
Rym: They want it as part of this gigantic.

273
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:04,270
Rym: basically I don't want to bring this up to talk about the specifics of this ludicrous idea.

274
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,290
Scott: I mean it's impossible.

275
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:06,929
Rym: I bring this up.

276
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,610
Scott: One person click save as on your dick.

277
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:09,849
Scott: Now your dick's gone.

278
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:18,830
Rym: I bring this up because many times people talk about the idea of privacy and they talked about this 10 billion times.

279
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,190
Rym: They want protections of privacy.

280
00:14:21,112 --> 00:14:24,290
Rym: This is a very synced argument as to why it's not going to work in the long run.

281
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:34,170
Rym: Because if you actually want governments to try to pass laws that will give you any amount of control over your personal data once it's been published somewhere.

282
00:14:35,512 --> 00:14:37,710
Rym: The only way to do that is with laws like this.

283
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:51,750
Rym: So if you read this story this article and you think that this is a good idea and that even if you don't think it's a good idea like even if you do think that it is a good idea you also think that it is enforceable in any reasonable way.

284
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,550
Scott: See it is a thing right.

285
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:56,370
Scott: We've tread the copyright ground as the most tread ground in the internet.

286
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,910
Scott: It is like there's not even dirt there anymore.

287
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,410
Scott: It's like just bedrock with like footprints all over it right.

288
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:04,930
Scott: It's actually this there's a groove in the bedrock for the pacing back and forth on the copyright grounds right.

289
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,381
Scott: And privacy is the second most tread.

290
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:09,870
Scott: like the bedrock is starting to sprout through the dirt right.

291
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,882
Scott: And we've talked about those things so much.

292
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:14,250
Scott: I don't want to talk about them again.

293
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:22,050
Scott: But the thing that's bothering me the most these days is when you go to the internets you go to places that are typically nerdy like say Boing Boing for example great example.

294
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:30,101
Scott: but any place that has similar ideas and philosophies and outlooks on life to Boing Boing and nerdy places they get this idea that copyright.

295
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:32,491
Scott: yeah there's no way that copyright is going to work.

296
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:35,463
Scott: dudes you got to tone it down but privacy they're like.

297
00:15:35,664 --> 00:15:37,331
Scott: we got to make the privacy even more.

298
00:15:37,391 --> 00:15:40,944
Scott: lots of privacy no copyright and I'm like we as you know.

299
00:15:40,964 --> 00:15:41,948
Scott: okay I can.

300
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:47,728
Scott: I know why you think these things but look you're totally inconsistent here right you go copyright.

301
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,795
Scott: once that song is out there.

302
00:15:50,378 --> 00:15:53,148
Scott: it's impossible to put it back in the jar you can't.

303
00:15:53,188 --> 00:15:54,855
Scott: the analog hole is unsealable.

304
00:15:54,895 --> 00:16:01,751
Scott: you just got to change the way you do business companies to deal with the fact that information is going to be shared around the world and you can't stop it.

305
00:16:02,112 --> 00:16:05,063
Scott: when it comes to privacy it's like no one says.

306
00:16:05,404 --> 00:16:06,628
Scott: you just got to change the way.

307
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:09,281
Scott: you got to change the way you live your life and share your information.

308
00:16:10,065 --> 00:16:14,384
Scott: once your dick is on the internet it's just like that song there's no way to bring your dick back.

309
00:16:15,288 --> 00:16:16,734
Scott: your dick is out your dicks out there.

310
00:16:17,195 --> 00:16:19,906
Scott: this is why all right it's the same problem.

311
00:16:20,006 --> 00:16:24,426
Scott: once information is released on the internet it's out for the entire world to see.

312
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:25,511
Scott: there's no putting it back.

313
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:26,435
Scott: deal with it.

314
00:16:26,595 --> 00:16:28,563
Scott: no privacy no copyrights.

315
00:16:28,704 --> 00:16:29,707
Scott: that's the way of the world.

316
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:31,074
Scott: you got to change the way you do business.

317
00:16:31,094 --> 00:16:32,462
Scott: you got to change the way you live your life.

318
00:16:32,663 --> 00:16:34,915
Scott: there is no technological or legal solution.

319
00:16:35,256 --> 00:16:36,059
Scott: give the fuck up.

320
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:41,526
Scott: and as long as you're consistent on two issues right like if you say more copyright more privacy then i'm like all right.

321
00:16:41,546 --> 00:16:43,555
Scott: at least you're consistent even though i disagree.

322
00:16:43,575 --> 00:16:51,884
Scott: or if you say less copyright less privacy okay you're on my side but if you're backwards and those two you you're fucked the fuck up.

323
00:16:52,727 --> 00:17:00,803
Rym: so read this article because it gives a very nice kind of legal analysis of the whole situation and it brings up all the examples that i would bring up if we were arguing this.

324
00:17:00,883 --> 00:17:09,039
Rym: obviously like what if someone else posts factual information about me do i have any rights to that data that was acquired legally by someone else?

325
00:17:09,602 --> 00:17:12,054
Scott: for example i took a picture dick and i put on my fligger.

326
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:14,931
Rym: yeah because i was i had my dick out at a party so you took a picture of it.

327
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:15,311
Rym: now what?

328
00:17:15,974 --> 00:17:16,115
Rym: who?

329
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,661
Rym: who has the rights to that my dick?

330
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:19,828
Rym: now you really want my dick.

331
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:23,875
Scott: i took it really or its soul with my camera.

332
00:17:31,745 --> 00:17:34,368
Rym: so things of the day.

333
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:38,501
Scott: this is actually kind of a serious cool thing of the day really i got a fun awesome thing.

334
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,666
Rym: that's not it's not.

335
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,417
Scott: it's not dancing or ponies or anything like that.

336
00:17:42,457 --> 00:17:44,465
Rym: oh my god i'm looking at my history.

337
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:48,559
Rym: it's literally music video pokemon mashup dancing right.

338
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:56,965
Scott: so this one is uh new york city street photographer is 1950 50s photos found headed to queen's museum of art.

339
00:17:57,106 --> 00:17:58,410
Rym: oh shit i want to go see that.

340
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:05,608
Rym: so yeah we can go down there and check them out but i just found there was an online archive of a whole bunch of photos of new york from the 70s and 80s that surfaced.

341
00:18:05,628 --> 00:18:07,056
Scott: yeah they got really good sculptures there too.

342
00:18:07,077 --> 00:18:08,666
Scott: i've been there but it was a long time ago.

343
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:10,816
Rym: uh we should go as soon as that exhibit opens.

344
00:18:11,197 --> 00:18:16,238
Scott: but yeah they got awesome old photos in the 50s of new york city and you can see them right here.

345
00:18:16,258 --> 00:18:20,277
Scott: uh on this post at least you can see one of you are six seven ten of them.

346
00:18:20,337 --> 00:18:27,512
Scott: i don't know if there's uh but it says here the negatives had been stored in more than 100 envelopes meticulously noted with location and date into larson.

347
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:32,994
Scott: so i'm pretty sure that there's more than 10 photos there that could have been 10 envelopes.

348
00:18:33,617 --> 00:18:37,114
Scott: photographs dating back to the 20s tested the fact that he was always the family shutterbug.

349
00:18:37,134 --> 00:18:40,267
Scott: but wasn't until the early 50s that his passion blossomed.

350
00:18:40,288 --> 00:18:51,332
Scott: throughout the 50s and early 60s he made weekend expeditions around new york with which is with his roly flex automat model 4 around his neck producing thousands of images which developed in a basement dark room.

351
00:18:52,195 --> 00:18:57,595
Scott: so they found some dude's photos and uh there's 10 awesome ones right here in this in this blog post.

352
00:18:57,856 --> 00:18:58,600
Rym: so think about this.

353
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:04,222
Rym: when we're 90 we're gonna be able to look back and see all the pictures we took of ourselves from like the 2000s.

354
00:19:04,283 --> 00:19:09,384
Scott: this is why pictures are a great invention yeah and digital pictures are great.

355
00:19:09,685 --> 00:19:16,157
Scott: and the thing is now we finally only recently have we actually had pictures that were you know good enough to actually sort of really really see.

356
00:19:16,177 --> 00:19:29,890
Scott: you know you look at like 1800s photos and it's like a couple people kind of with a blurry you know vignette around them and i just enjoy seeing paintings like super good portrait paintings from like the 1678. the thing about paintings is like.

357
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:30,835
Scott: that's not what the dude looks like.

358
00:19:30,855 --> 00:19:32,463
Rym: no because some of them it's like.

359
00:19:32,503 --> 00:19:36,043
Rym: yeah the dude clearly did not look like that because that is too perfect and pretty.

360
00:19:36,405 --> 00:19:40,526
Rym: but i got some pictures of people where it is clear that is what they actually looked like.

361
00:19:40,566 --> 00:19:42,575
Rym: because who would make up that hideous wart?

362
00:19:44,161 --> 00:19:47,413
Scott: maybe the dude liked his own war or it was just such a big war there was no way you could.

363
00:19:47,574 --> 00:19:48,337
Scott: you could remove it.

364
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:53,574
Scott: yeah without people like who's that it's like gorbachev i can remove that.

365
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:54,176
Scott: it's like who's that?

366
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:55,461
Scott: who's that ball guy?

367
00:19:57,146 --> 00:20:04,997
Rym: so i'm a big fan now of electro swing and it reminded me of a band that i was a huge fan of way back in the 90s the squirrel nut zippers.

368
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:05,862
Rym: and they do.

369
00:20:06,022 --> 00:20:07,249
Scott: they did kind of like keep to reverse.

370
00:20:07,269 --> 00:20:08,533
Scott: we're talking about digs now nuts.

371
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:09,738
Rym: so they used.

372
00:20:09,778 --> 00:20:14,274
Rym: they did like squirrels swing music and it's really like i like their jam.

373
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:14,957
Rym: they're my jam.

374
00:20:15,057 --> 00:20:15,720
Rym: to do a good degree.

375
00:20:16,422 --> 00:20:19,815
Scott: they got weirder strangely obsessed with jam and they did.

376
00:20:19,936 --> 00:20:23,209
Rym: they did i point out i haven't brought up ponies at all.

377
00:20:23,229 --> 00:20:26,279
Rym: neither did i shut up brought ponies like three times all right.

378
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:31,357
Rym: so they did a song called the ghost of stephen foster which i really like.

379
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,738
Rym: stephen foster is the man who wrote such classics as camp town races and oh suzanna.

380
00:20:36,758 --> 00:20:43,144
Rym: i learned recently some interesting stuff about him that i'm gonna save for another thing of the day that i did not know.

381
00:20:43,465 --> 00:20:45,755
Rym: but anyway they have a song the ghost of stephen foster.

382
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:47,542
Rym: it's kind of a creepy cool song.

383
00:20:48,386 --> 00:20:50,735
Rym: i think it's ripe for an electro swing remix.

384
00:20:50,775 --> 00:20:53,184
Rym: however there's a music video to the song.

385
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:59,587
Rym: the music video is in the old mickey mouse like black and white haunted house style of animation.

386
00:20:59,607 --> 00:21:00,269
Scott: that's a great style.

387
00:21:00,852 --> 00:21:02,017
Rym: it's a great music video.

388
00:21:02,037 --> 00:21:02,961
Rym: it's a great song.

389
00:21:03,383 --> 00:21:03,504
Rym: it.

390
00:21:03,624 --> 00:21:04,769
Rym: everything about this is great.

391
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:07,643
Rym: i think my favorite part's the little radies the radies.

392
00:21:07,663 --> 00:21:09,531
Rym: there's little radies like riding the slide with them.

393
00:21:10,194 --> 00:21:11,118
Rym: you should all watch this.

394
00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:14,654
Rym: i wanted to get over to a million views by the time you're done watching it.

395
00:21:14,975 --> 00:21:17,889
Rym: so briefly in the meta moment the book club book is done.

396
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,154
Rym: we haven't picked the next one yet.

397
00:21:19,435 --> 00:21:20,258
Rym: the episode is out.

398
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,030
Rym: we will be at pax east doing so far.

399
00:21:23,471 --> 00:21:26,119
Rym: we have one panel we can announce we will be lecturing on.

400
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:39,506
Rym: let's play money making game to 10 2050. on saturday at the con which is april 7th at 4 30 p.m in the cat theater.

401
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:41,933
Rym: more announcements will come.

402
00:21:41,993 --> 00:21:46,477
Rym: we have not finalized the schedule for the other things we were doing but it's actually a lot closer than you think.

403
00:21:46,517 --> 00:21:47,322
Scott: it's april right.

404
00:21:47,462 --> 00:21:48,850
Rym: i know we gotta write this fucking panel.

405
00:21:49,252 --> 00:21:49,714
Scott: i got it.

406
00:21:49,915 --> 00:21:50,337
Scott: i got it.

407
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:51,120
Scott: it was my idea.

408
00:21:51,221 --> 00:21:52,889
Scott: i got it and my panels are better than yours.

409
00:21:52,949 --> 00:21:54,718
Rym: anyway get it going quickly and i need something to do.

410
00:21:54,738 --> 00:21:58,979
Rym: get it get it going quickly so i can contribute because we gotta we gotta get this going.

411
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:01,370
Scott: i don't need your country anyway.

412
00:22:03,331 --> 00:22:04,717
Rym: besides i wrote the description for it.

413
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:13,092
Rym: sure games can make their money in many ways but how do these models affect intentionally or not the design choices of the game makers themselves?

414
00:22:13,514 --> 00:22:14,418
Rym: what about the players?

415
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,090
Rym: you play a game differently depending on how you paid for it free.

416
00:22:17,632 --> 00:22:21,063
Rym: if it's free i don't feel subscription or silly hats.

417
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,974
Rym: what do these different models mean to games at their core?

418
00:22:24,075 --> 00:22:26,045
Scott: if it's free i don't feel bad stopping playing.

419
00:22:26,065 --> 00:22:32,192
Scott: but if i paid a lot of money i feel bad if i don't beat only 10 rupees and hopefully you won't have to pay the door repair charge.

420
00:22:32,272 --> 00:22:36,664
Rym: yeah i cannot account all that stuff coming up.

421
00:22:36,684 --> 00:22:37,486
Rym: we'll talk about it later.

422
00:22:38,188 --> 00:22:40,114
Rym: so apparently the internet's going to be destroyed.

423
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:40,555
Scott: how?

424
00:22:40,636 --> 00:22:41,017
Scott: so?

425
00:22:41,258 --> 00:22:56,551
Rym: so apparently like take out all 13 root dns servers at once with the bombs there's actually 26 because each one has a bag anyway i'm just saying so apparently the do not track functionality that people are using meaning hey advertisers don't track.

426
00:22:56,591 --> 00:23:04,582
Rym: what i'm doing with your stupid cookies will ruin the entire free internet because every ad supported site will go under because they won't make any money anymore.

427
00:23:04,622 --> 00:23:10,310
Rym: and before we get any further i'm gonna head all this off by pointing out that ad block did not end the free internet.

428
00:23:10,711 --> 00:23:10,851
Rym: yeah.

429
00:23:11,994 --> 00:23:15,924
Rym: so uh what now jeffra with your post?

430
00:23:16,405 --> 00:23:17,066
Rym: what are you thinking?

431
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:23,132
Rym: the only people who are saying this are the same advertisers with their scammy bullshit tactics that we tried to get rid of with ad block.

432
00:23:24,076 --> 00:23:30,403
Scott: uh i think the thing the article that you're reading is actually an article that agrees with us and is replying to someone else who disagrees with us.

433
00:23:30,463 --> 00:23:32,311
Rym: yeah i have a list of articles here.

434
00:23:32,592 --> 00:23:37,172
Rym: okay i have this whole like chain of discussions but this argument seems to come up perennially.

435
00:23:37,232 --> 00:23:38,237
Rym: the idea that i mean.

436
00:23:38,257 --> 00:23:42,835
Rym: remember we were at rit and we had a friend luke who ran a website that had some ads to make money.

437
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:45,925
Rym: he ran another website that made money another way.

438
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:47,873
Rym: i won't get into that now.

439
00:23:47,913 --> 00:23:50,505
Rym: other than that i helped him get the uh content.

440
00:23:50,525 --> 00:23:52,554
Scott: i don't know why he did work for free when you were poor.

441
00:23:52,574 --> 00:23:53,979
Rym: no because he was paying.

442
00:23:54,381 --> 00:23:55,866
Rym: oh he was paying for that hentai.

443
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:58,115
Scott: okay and then you just spilled the beans.

444
00:23:58,175 --> 00:24:02,050
Rym: i i had a w get script that would just like raid hentai sites.

445
00:24:03,111 --> 00:24:14,050
Rym: so anyway all that aside so he one day someone said something like yeah i just block ads and back then i mean we would use like host files to block ads because we already did a show on this.

446
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:14,672
Scott: i'm pretty sure.

447
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:18,865
Rym: we talked about internet advertising in a very general sense six years ago.

448
00:24:18,886 --> 00:24:21,475
Scott: i think we discussed this exact thing.

449
00:24:22,198 --> 00:24:24,870
Scott: so someone listen to that show and find out i don't think anyone today.

450
00:24:25,091 --> 00:24:26,837
Rym: that's not even in the rss feed anymore.

451
00:24:27,459 --> 00:24:29,265
Scott: well the rss feed is different story.

452
00:24:29,285 --> 00:24:29,566
Scott: yeah.

453
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:32,858
Rym: so uh he basically he noticed.

454
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:35,307
Rym: you know i said something like yeah i block ads.

455
00:24:35,347 --> 00:24:36,311
Rym: why would i want to see an ad?

456
00:24:36,331 --> 00:24:37,736
Rym: and he flipped out.

457
00:24:38,017 --> 00:24:42,833
Rym: he was angry that it you know arguing that it was stealing to block an ad on a website.

458
00:24:42,874 --> 00:24:45,484
Rym: how are our websites supposed to make money without ads?

459
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:48,877
Scott: the thing is i've more recently he talked about how like.

460
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:55,320
Scott: oh well you know if you visit the site and you see the ad you don't click on it you actually harm the.

461
00:24:55,741 --> 00:24:58,410
Scott: uh you know the the the rate at you know the like.

462
00:24:59,053 --> 00:24:59,756
Scott: it's very important.

463
00:24:59,776 --> 00:24:59,977
Scott: the.

464
00:25:00,097 --> 00:25:00,921
Scott: uh what's it called rate?

465
00:25:00,941 --> 00:25:01,665
Scott: the conversion rate.

466
00:25:01,685 --> 00:25:06,673
Scott: yep right so he's like if you see the ad you don't click you're actually hurting the conversion rate and an ad block person isn't going to click anyway.

467
00:25:06,814 --> 00:25:11,032
Scott: no so ad blocking actually helps the conversion rate even though it decreases the views.

468
00:25:11,213 --> 00:25:18,195
Rym: i recall this argument occurring when vcr's appeared and even earlier when remote controls appeared.

469
00:25:18,215 --> 00:25:23,034
Rym: i don't recall that personally but i've read articles of people complaining about it and talking about it.

470
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:34,177
Rym: people were worried that if you could just change the channel easily people would change the channel whenever there was an advertisement that maybe people didn't actually want to watch advertisements.

471
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:36,124
Rym: i mean isn't it stealing?

472
00:25:36,164 --> 00:25:38,072
Rym: ted turner said something like this a long time ago.

473
00:25:38,092 --> 00:25:45,747
Rym: i'm pretty sure he's come around now that if you are watching something and you mute the ads don't pay you know you get up and make a sandwich while the ads are on.

474
00:25:45,969 --> 00:25:46,431
Rym: you're a thief.

475
00:25:46,973 --> 00:25:48,598
Rym: you're getting your content for free.

476
00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:51,789
Rym: you're not paying with your eyeballs but doesn't that?

477
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,034
Rym: what about the conversion rate?

478
00:25:53,054 --> 00:25:56,210
Rym: what about i mean if i don't buy a chevy every time i see a chevy ad?

479
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,876
Rym: am not stealing from the advertiser?

480
00:25:57,896 --> 00:26:00,245
Scott: yeah so his is the thing right.

481
00:26:00,265 --> 00:26:04,337
Scott: there's the fundamental problem right and that all ad sales are bullshit.

482
00:26:04,358 --> 00:26:05,641
Scott: this i can't understand.

483
00:26:05,761 --> 00:26:10,395
Scott: why ad buyers continue to pay what they pay for ads.

484
00:26:10,576 --> 00:26:12,804
Rym: i don't all ads are not bullshit.

485
00:26:12,844 --> 00:26:15,453
Rym: the ads the whole ad the entire ad market is not bullshit.

486
00:26:15,514 --> 00:26:16,276
Scott: it's mostly.

487
00:26:16,296 --> 00:26:19,769
Scott: it is however mostly bullshit but it's like most ads.

488
00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:24,182
Scott: it's like who is paying for ads on like weird ass cable channel.

489
00:26:24,743 --> 00:26:26,508
Scott: you know that no one watches.

490
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:27,734
Scott: it's like that.

491
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:29,826
Scott: ad is not helping you at all but you're paying a lot of money.

492
00:26:29,846 --> 00:26:30,209
Rym: how do you know?

493
00:26:30,229 --> 00:26:34,489
Rym: you could argue that those ads are working because otherwise people couldn't afford to keep buying them.

494
00:26:37,452 --> 00:26:56,962
Scott: maybe i don't know but anyway so in every time i you know i've seen a lot of ad buying and selling in all the places i've worked at websites you know at various places and it's always the situation where it seems like the people selling the ads are charging way too much money for something that's not worth what it costs.

495
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,627
Scott: but i wonder buyers keep buying.

496
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:03,023
Rym: what i always wonder in this whole thing like with tv ads for example are the ads on like hulu?

497
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:05,070
Rym: who exactly is the fool?

498
00:27:05,793 --> 00:27:09,507
Rym: is it the person selling the ad having overvalued this entire business model?

499
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:10,110
Rym: or do they know?

500
00:27:10,832 --> 00:27:14,723
Rym: is it is the person buying the ad like a sucker?

501
00:27:15,044 --> 00:27:18,939
Rym: or do they know too when they're passing on the real cost to someone else they're just a middleman.

502
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,065
Scott: that's possible at one point.

503
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:22,658
Rym: who is the person who is specifically being ripped off by this?

504
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,341
Scott: it's all.

505
00:27:23,361 --> 00:27:23,823
Scott: that's hard.

506
00:27:23,863 --> 00:27:29,370
Scott: that's why it continues to work because it's like somehow everyone feels like they're getting good deal and then someone's.

507
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,138
Rym: so here's the messed up thing i see.

508
00:27:31,218 --> 00:27:35,716
Rym: i do see articles talking about how statistically ads actually do work like car ads.

509
00:27:36,318 --> 00:27:39,771
Rym: advertising cars translates directly into car sales like straight up.

510
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:45,738
Scott: i can't believe that you're telling me that it's a ford which is a well-known car brand that people buy right and drive.

511
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:49,071
Scott: if they just stopped advertising on tv that their sales would go way down.

512
00:27:49,332 --> 00:28:03,605
Rym: so i've read if they just stopped spending money on saying that when you interview people who buy cars the majority of people are influenced primarily by advertisements they saw and secondarily by test drives but and third by word of mouth but two.

513
00:28:04,086 --> 00:28:14,040
Rym: it talked a lot about how most people from the decision to buy a car to the execution of that is less than a couple of weeks and they do very little independent research.

514
00:28:14,522 --> 00:28:19,140
Scott: but you're telling me that if you got rid of all ford advertisements that people would forget ford completely.

515
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,212
Scott: and then you know ford sales might go down.

516
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:26,687
Scott: but are they gonna go down enough to at the point at which you know?

517
00:28:26,707 --> 00:28:32,404
Scott: the savings for not spending bajillions of dollars on ads is you know not a good profit?

518
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:39,788
Rym: you know i really wonder about that because notice during the super bowl most of the ads are cars or beer but cars mostly.

519
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,884
Rym: yeah cars soft drinks and beer are like the only things that get ads.

520
00:28:42,904 --> 00:28:43,246
Scott: so it's like.

521
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:47,105
Scott: i can't even remember a single actual car that was in any of those ads.

522
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,130
Scott: i just remember they're a bunch of cars.

523
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:53,134
Rym: here's something i've noticed very telling that when i was a kid and tv was just you know i'd watch like the simpsons or whatever.

524
00:28:53,736 --> 00:28:58,433
Rym: i could tell you what car manufacturer made every make and model of car.

525
00:28:58,533 --> 00:29:01,786
Scott: well i just know that anyway and i haven't watched tv in years.

526
00:29:01,847 --> 00:29:05,017
Rym: yeah here's the thing i used to just know that like just completely.

527
00:29:05,097 --> 00:29:14,394
Rym: but now that i don't see any ads ever my knowledge is dropping and i've had to look up a couple of times like from a make of a car or a model of a car who made it.

528
00:29:14,655 --> 00:29:16,744
Scott: oh i still know even though without seeing the ads.

529
00:29:16,885 --> 00:29:17,247
Rym: you know 100 percent.

530
00:29:18,151 --> 00:29:20,099
Scott: yeah tell me a car i'll tell you all right.

531
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,112
Rym: uh i don't know the elantra the honda elantra yep you got that.

532
00:29:23,152 --> 00:29:26,151
Rym: i know that one too though it's hard because i can only think of the ones that i still know.

533
00:29:26,352 --> 00:29:28,921
Scott: okay but anyway i've noticed.

534
00:29:29,042 --> 00:29:32,514
Scott: yeah they don't say that though the commercials always say honda anyway.

535
00:29:33,196 --> 00:29:44,578
Rym: so but i i saw these articles talking about how people don't actually research their buying decisions that much and are influenced a lot by advertising like ad campaigns correlate to sales pretty strongly in some areas.

536
00:29:44,638 --> 00:29:48,232
Scott: correlate because maybe it's just the companies that are bigger.

537
00:29:48,674 --> 00:29:51,185
Scott: they get more sales have more money to spend on ads yep.

538
00:29:51,225 --> 00:29:53,759
Rym: but like pepsi right now is having trouble because sales are dropping.

539
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:58,322
Rym: so their plan is to do more advertising and historically every time a soft drink company does more advertising they make more sales.

540
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:03,083
Scott: but this the more advertising usually also uh goes along with.

541
00:30:03,123 --> 00:30:05,335
Scott: like you know they always try to make different drinks and stuff.

542
00:30:05,395 --> 00:30:08,252
Scott: i always wonder that too like why do they try to make like all these different pepsi's?

543
00:30:08,272 --> 00:30:13,637
Scott: why don't they just try to really push hard on plain old fucking pepsi and not make all these different things to get all the niche markets?

544
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,108
Scott: are there really that many like?

545
00:30:16,289 --> 00:30:16,731
Rym: i don't know.

546
00:30:16,871 --> 00:30:19,500
Rym: all i remember is i used to drink surge that's you.

547
00:30:19,741 --> 00:30:23,775
Rym: yeah surge was very important to me anyway.

548
00:30:23,836 --> 00:30:25,441
Scott: so let's go back to the original topic.

549
00:30:26,023 --> 00:30:28,351
Rym: so i don't want to talk about the social side of it anymore.

550
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:39,784
Rym: let's talk about the technology because i mean internet advertising right now really only exists at least on websites for people who are too dumb to install adblock.

551
00:30:39,884 --> 00:30:42,672
Rym: yeah how is it still working?

552
00:30:43,395 --> 00:30:44,941
Scott: because a lot of people don't put adblock.

553
00:30:45,322 --> 00:30:50,420
Scott: so some people you know they have they actually feel like they want the sites to benefit from the ads.

554
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:57,765
Rym: but if i want that why don't you enable the mode that downloads the ads and just doesn't display them?

555
00:30:57,825 --> 00:31:00,516
Rym: because then everybody wins except the person who bought the ad.

556
00:31:00,536 --> 00:31:06,964
Scott: because you might like the ad and click on it and then the site really benefits depends on what kind of ad campaign it is.

557
00:31:06,984 --> 00:31:08,189
Scott: it you know but you don't know.

558
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,375
Scott: you don't know without seeing it.

559
00:31:09,395 --> 00:31:13,795
Rym: but then again what if i just every website i like i click on the ads all the time but i don't look at them?

560
00:31:14,016 --> 00:31:21,282
Rym: what if i make a plug-in where i can say click on every ad of all of these sites to give them click-throughs?

561
00:31:21,483 --> 00:31:26,163
Scott: because then it's click fraud and the site actually gets in trouble because they the ad networks can detect that.

562
00:31:26,344 --> 00:31:26,866
Rym: but is it?

563
00:31:27,288 --> 00:31:28,452
Rym: at what point is it click fraud?

564
00:31:28,493 --> 00:31:32,547
Rym: what if i personally click on ads all the time on sites i like?

565
00:31:32,868 --> 00:31:34,073
Scott: it depends how much you do it like.

566
00:31:34,113 --> 00:31:38,732
Scott: if i did it on a site that i visited a zillion times a day you know that would be.

567
00:31:38,852 --> 00:31:42,030
Scott: they might come through as a false positive for click fraud because i'm just clicking on the ads.

568
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:56,611
Scott: so much plus most of the money you can really make is on ads that do something like not just go to the site but it's like how many people actually fucking sign up for the mailing list and then you know only clicking on the ad once will actually get anything or get people to actually buy.

569
00:31:56,832 --> 00:32:00,065
Scott: you know an ad for an e-commerce site and then they actually buy something.

570
00:32:00,466 --> 00:32:03,219
Scott: then they make big money because they had like an affiliate you know.

571
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,133
Rym: so i guess i guess what i'm getting at is i do have a question for you.

572
00:32:06,535 --> 00:32:08,122
Rym: because adblock didn't kill the internet.

573
00:32:08,242 --> 00:32:09,166
Rym: you know the free internet.

574
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:16,691
Rym: but i'm wondering if the only reason that's the case is because ad blocking is not actually ubiquitous yet.

575
00:32:16,832 --> 00:32:17,213
Scott: yeah i'm.

576
00:32:17,414 --> 00:32:22,473
Rym: i'm wondering like like what would happen if firefox said you know what by default ad block?

577
00:32:22,754 --> 00:32:26,307
Scott: well it wouldn't matter because firefox is actually losing market share.

578
00:32:26,327 --> 00:32:30,466
Rym: so what if firefox and chrome and ie were all like you know what by default ad block?

579
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,034
Scott: that would be the awesomest thing ever.

580
00:32:32,214 --> 00:32:34,343
Rym: but what would something happen?

581
00:32:34,383 --> 00:32:40,770
Rym: because look at youtube the ad network youtube and college humor and all those sites have been going down the road of fucking interstitial.

582
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,760
Scott: yeah well first of all google would never do that.

583
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,709
Scott: google's been doing fucking interstitials.

584
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:49,110
Rym: google's an ad company i know but they've been doing interstitials on youtube already.

585
00:32:49,451 --> 00:32:58,256
Scott: yeah um but second of all right uh number one all the companies that do ads would find ways to get around the ad block.

586
00:32:58,276 --> 00:32:59,843
Scott: there would be a war of the ad block.

587
00:32:59,903 --> 00:33:06,027
Rym: right because right now i point out that war happened like three times already and every time advertisers lost.

588
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,939
Scott: but here's the thing google was not on either side of that war.

589
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:12,649
Scott: if you if you know if i mean google runs chrome.

590
00:33:12,689 --> 00:33:14,295
Scott: so pretend chrome was run by someone else.

591
00:33:14,396 --> 00:33:14,576
Scott: yep.

592
00:33:14,737 --> 00:33:19,815
Scott: so all the browsers were run by people who hated ads and they all put ad block in right.

593
00:33:20,657 --> 00:33:25,248
Scott: um uh so someone's calling me from texas.

594
00:33:25,268 --> 00:33:25,930
Scott: i got to see who that is.

595
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:28,901
Rym: oh well i can interrupt because i was just handed a valentine.

596
00:33:28,921 --> 00:33:30,747
Rym: i got a valentine from emily.

597
00:33:31,189 --> 00:33:34,301
Rym: uh no it's not from emily it's from someone else who came in a package quote.

598
00:33:34,361 --> 00:33:37,011
Rym: you are 99.9 sweet and you know who.

599
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:39,057
Rym: it's from applejack.

600
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:43,992
Rym: okay no it's it's from uh our friend kristin but it's an applejack valentine.

601
00:33:44,012 --> 00:33:44,895
Rym: okay.

602
00:33:45,798 --> 00:33:50,714
Scott: so as i was saying right you know this ad this ad versus ad blocking war right has always been sort of like.

603
00:33:51,115 --> 00:33:55,492
Scott: you know double click and ad networks which is now owned by google versus ad block.

604
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,082
Scott: and such right ad block plus is just some open source dudes.

605
00:33:58,263 --> 00:34:05,227
Scott: yep if google was on the other side of that war you know they actually were fighting against adblock plus.

606
00:34:05,307 --> 00:34:07,375
Scott: first of all they'd remove adblock plus.

607
00:34:07,536 --> 00:34:07,817
Scott: you know.

608
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:12,312
Scott: well i've said assuming they don't own chrome right um they would.

609
00:34:12,473 --> 00:34:14,964
Scott: you know there's no way you could out code google right.

610
00:34:15,004 --> 00:34:18,759
Scott: they would totally find ways to make unblockable ads they already have.

611
00:34:18,799 --> 00:34:22,654
Rym: but what they do is they have those stupid pop-ups within youtube.

612
00:34:23,516 --> 00:34:28,938
Rym: you know the ones that like overlay the bottom of the video yeah and they have the interstitials in youtube that appear occasionally.

613
00:34:28,978 --> 00:34:33,475
Rym: yep i know i can get around like i. the thing is you know how i get around that.

614
00:34:33,576 --> 00:34:53,446
Rym: in the end what i always wanted to do just to like throw a monkey wrench in all this is make something like boxy right or like a browser plugin that whenever one of those interstitial things appears it downloads it like it's running but it plays a random youtube video of a cat instead because i you could make an ocr kind of thing.

615
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,589
Rym: that would go automatically.

616
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,117
Scott: youtube video of the cat has an ad in it too?

617
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:59,204
Rym: no i use a non-youtube video.

618
00:34:59,545 --> 00:35:01,331
Rym: no i embed videos i don't know.

619
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:03,398
Rym: i make a server of videos okay.

620
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,336
Rym: or maybe i have a thing that just clicks and closes the overlay ad immediately when it appears.

621
00:35:10,122 --> 00:35:10,684
Rym: then what do they do?

622
00:35:10,905 --> 00:35:11,527
Rym: keep popping up.

623
00:35:11,607 --> 00:35:12,389
Rym: i keep closing it.

624
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,295
Scott: the point is you still have to.

625
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:14,542
Scott: you have to keep waiting right?

626
00:35:14,704 --> 00:35:15,368
Scott: you know even if you're.

627
00:35:15,408 --> 00:35:20,669
Scott: if you're don't with the overlay they can make it so that it's possible to make it to where they will.

628
00:35:20,729 --> 00:35:21,572
Scott: not you know the.

629
00:35:21,672 --> 00:35:29,014
Scott: the data won't come through to your end until you have either seen the ad or waited an amount of time.

630
00:35:29,034 --> 00:35:30,478
Rym: now that's the next step.

631
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:37,081
Rym: if i had to wait if they interstitialed everything like every third video on youtube would be an interstitial.

632
00:35:37,864 --> 00:35:48,762
Rym: i would set up the equivalent of a dvr that would let me get ahead on picking videos i want to watch and it would just save every video and play them on my own like local server and like.

633
00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:51,551
Rym: i could click on like a video and another video.

634
00:35:51,591 --> 00:35:56,771
Rym: but even then you're still waiting because i'm watching the videos i want to watch from my queue.

635
00:35:56,831 --> 00:36:01,453
Scott: i only wait for you but that does that time between when you queued them up and when you started watching.

636
00:36:01,494 --> 00:36:02,438
Scott: that's your wait period.

637
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,223
Rym: it depends.

638
00:36:03,303 --> 00:36:04,851
Scott: you could click and start watching right.

639
00:36:04,891 --> 00:36:12,906
Rym: then by clicking on multiple videos in a row and making playlists you could set it up where you never had to actually wait unless google really went out of their way.

640
00:36:12,966 --> 00:36:21,862
Rym: but i point out that as much as i love youtube if i couldn't get around all the ads like if the ads actually got in my way i would literally stop watching youtube videos.

641
00:36:22,204 --> 00:36:23,048
Rym: i would go somewhere else.

642
00:36:23,149 --> 00:36:24,213
Scott: but then where would you go?

643
00:36:24,233 --> 00:36:26,262
Scott: that had the videos vimeo right now.

644
00:36:26,283 --> 00:36:28,493
Scott: well vimeo doesn't have the videos that's enough.

645
00:36:28,573 --> 00:36:29,458
Scott: it's also kind of strict.

646
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,816
Scott: they don't let you post like videos of video games or a lot of things.

647
00:36:32,836 --> 00:36:37,499
Scott: they don't like what i would actually do like youtube where you can post anything if youtube videos got intrusive enough.

648
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:41,801
Rym: i mean i stopped watching tv partly because i didn't want to deal with the ads that were just so jarring.

649
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:42,867
Scott: stop watching youtube.

650
00:36:43,048 --> 00:36:45,739
Rym: i would just stop consuming media that had so many ads.

651
00:36:45,819 --> 00:36:49,596
Rym: i would rather pay for an ad for youtube than have intolerable ads.

652
00:36:49,616 --> 00:36:50,018
Scott: yeah it's like you.

653
00:36:50,038 --> 00:36:51,567
Scott: just go to bittorrent and download videos.

654
00:36:51,587 --> 00:36:56,161
Rym: yeah i would go straight to piracy but it would kill the kicked in the nuts demographic?

655
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:59,912
Scott: it would for sure so is that it?

656
00:36:59,992 --> 00:37:00,916
Rym: i mean the only way to.

657
00:37:01,198 --> 00:37:03,046
Scott: actually there's some people who will sit through it.

658
00:37:03,106 --> 00:37:04,111
Scott: so what do you do?

659
00:37:04,231 --> 00:37:04,372
Rym: so?

660
00:37:04,753 --> 00:37:09,368
Rym: so here's my question is the end game everyone has ad block and no one sees ads?

661
00:37:09,749 --> 00:37:10,973
Rym: or is the actual end game?

662
00:37:11,535 --> 00:37:19,563
Rym: everybody's smart has ad block and the brains of the less enlightened are basically the fodder that allow us to see.

663
00:37:19,703 --> 00:37:22,232
Rym: like are they the guys thrown under the bus so that we can see?

664
00:37:22,252 --> 00:37:25,384
Rym: is the future where tech guys block ads no one else?

665
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:30,962
Scott: no i i think i think yes because no company is ever going to block the ads.

666
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,527
Rym: uh what if i made it?

667
00:37:32,547 --> 00:37:33,430
Scott: because that would they be?

668
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:36,904
Scott: that would be opening up the biggest you know can of worms in the universe.

669
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:42,121
Rym: i would not be uncomfortable forming a company that sold a dvr that straight up blocked ads.

670
00:37:43,265 --> 00:37:45,853
Scott: i wonder we need talk to a lawyer and see what happens.

671
00:37:46,094 --> 00:37:57,010
Rym: i'd form that company in like australia and i'd only sell it to non-australians or i run it through shady channels and you can donate to me semi-anonymously.

672
00:37:57,452 --> 00:37:59,722
Scott: i'm surprised like what license is adblock plus?

673
00:37:59,782 --> 00:38:02,233
Scott: because if it's like depending on the license you could just sell it.

674
00:38:03,398 --> 00:38:10,510
Scott: you know you could just be like hey you can make a website that's like at the ultimate adblock or five bucks and all you're doing is giving them adblock plus which is free.

675
00:38:11,173 --> 00:38:19,051
Rym: but i guess i'm wondering if there is a point at which everyone's using adblock or if there's a mass of people who just can't be asked to do the trivial thing to not see ads anymore.

676
00:38:20,396 --> 00:38:27,202
Scott: i mean i even like i used to do custom stuff like when it's weird like there's some people they actually you know we've only considered so far.

677
00:38:27,242 --> 00:38:33,528
Scott: the people who you know don't block ads because they don't know better or there are actually people i know where it's.

678
00:38:33,569 --> 00:38:35,861
Scott: not even they you know feel bad for the companies.

679
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:37,530
Scott: they want to see the ads to help them out.

680
00:38:37,871 --> 00:38:40,842
Scott: people legitimately say i like ads i want to see them.

681
00:38:41,284 --> 00:38:53,863
Rym: now what i don't get is the only kind of ad that has ever been useful to me and or effective to me are ads that inform me a product or service class of which i did not know there was an offering exists.

682
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:57,515
Rym: but even then i don't go by the thing that was advertised.

683
00:38:57,756 --> 00:39:00,184
Rym: i go investigate the class of products i discovered.

684
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:03,860
Rym: yep or at the best it might be a tv show i didn't know about.

685
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,512
Rym: but you know what i found out about that through word of mouth.

686
00:39:06,933 --> 00:39:11,169
Rym: yeah and i usually pirate it to see if it's good before i would pay for it.

687
00:39:12,552 --> 00:39:16,449
Rym: and if i can't pirate it and i can't get it cheaply i probably just give up right away.

688
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,820
Rym: but this article wasn't even talking about that.

689
00:39:20,101 --> 00:39:23,114
Rym: they're trying to claim that the do not track will kill the free internet.

690
00:39:24,057 --> 00:39:27,649
Rym: well what serves the same purpose that the current adblock does?

691
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:32,284
Rym: well people who let the do not track happen get better ads.

692
00:39:32,605 --> 00:39:36,684
Rym: the people who don't want to be tracked are the kinds of people who are paranoid about ads anyway won't click on them.

693
00:39:36,865 --> 00:39:46,144
Scott: yeah well you know what they're also saying is basically like look there are websites out there that make extra money and a lot more money because they have all sorts of tracking in their ads.

694
00:39:46,586 --> 00:39:56,461
Scott: and if the ads can't track then those sites aren't going to make so much money and people won't be able to provide content for free on the internet if they can't make money on ads.

695
00:39:56,522 --> 00:39:59,272
Scott: and the thing is you know it's just weird.

696
00:39:59,312 --> 00:40:00,478
Scott: these people don't seem to understand.

697
00:40:00,538 --> 00:40:06,085
Scott: it's like look okay i do go to a lot of sites on the internet that have free content and that is paid for by ads.

698
00:40:06,105 --> 00:40:08,797
Scott: like you know you go to a website of a newspaper or something like that i go to.

699
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:10,625
Scott: you know i do go to some percentage of those.

700
00:40:11,388 --> 00:40:13,858
Scott: most of this stuff or college humor perfect example.

701
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:19,396
Scott: right most of the stuff that i go see on the internet doesn't even have ads to block.

702
00:40:19,858 --> 00:40:27,206
Scott: it's just content made by people like us like this podcast for people like us and there's no ads and there's no money being made.

703
00:40:27,226 --> 00:40:36,399
Scott: it's just everyone putting in a small portion of their salary into say for example libsyn or linode or some hosting company or their isp and that just pays for everything.

704
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:42,420
Scott: or amazon and everyone is just sharing making things freely and sharing them freely with no ads on them.

705
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:52,819
Scott: so the free internet which is that's like 80 percent of the stuff i consume on the internet yep is in no danger of their advertising being completely outlawed by all world governments.

706
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,370
Scott: right it's there is no threat whatsoever.

707
00:40:57,432 --> 00:41:08,799
Rym: now i've noticed too that when i do see ads for whatever reason like i turn off ad block to take a look like i went around looking at the internet today without ad block just to kind of prep for the show i did not see a single ad.

708
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,807
Rym: that was for a thing i would ever consider purchasing.

709
00:41:10,827 --> 00:41:12,975
Rym: yeah it was mostly ads for cars.

710
00:41:12,995 --> 00:41:16,690
Rym: i don't need a car and if i needed a car i'd do independent research on one.

711
00:41:17,673 --> 00:41:18,596
Rym: what have i bought recently?

712
00:41:18,656 --> 00:41:20,362
Rym: i bought the gopro camera.

713
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:22,830
Rym: i researched like two weeks out of that.

714
00:41:23,171 --> 00:41:23,955
Rym: yeah i researched like.

715
00:41:23,975 --> 00:41:26,045
Scott: i also researched that it's the best one.

716
00:41:26,085 --> 00:41:29,098
Rym: yeah like of all the cameras like that was the best one everyone uses.

717
00:41:29,138 --> 00:41:29,700
Scott: it's the best one.

718
00:41:30,243 --> 00:41:31,347
Rym: i bought two hard drives.

719
00:41:31,749 --> 00:41:34,017
Rym: i bought the cheapest ones with the most stars on newegg.

720
00:41:34,218 --> 00:41:36,667
Rym: yeah uh i bought an sd card.

721
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:38,293
Rym: i bought the cheapest one on newegg.

722
00:41:38,453 --> 00:41:40,721
Scott: yep i bought a shirt.

723
00:41:41,102 --> 00:41:41,965
Rym: i bought a shower curtain.

724
00:41:42,165 --> 00:41:43,650
Rym: bought the cheapest one on amazon.

725
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:56,323
Scott: actually i got this this the shower curtain i have is the highest rated plastic shower curtain on amazon and i know you don't want a plastic one right because we have had many a plastic one over the years and all of them got mildewy and we threw them away

726
00:41:56,384 --> 00:41:56,504
Rym: right.

727
00:41:56,524 --> 00:41:59,417
Rym: i had a fabric one that i could wash in a washing machine.

728
00:41:59,457 --> 00:42:00,923
Rym: that worked really well for a long time.

729
00:42:00,943 --> 00:42:03,535
Scott: the plastic one that i have now that i bought an amazon.

730
00:42:03,555 --> 00:42:05,123
Scott: that's the highest rated one on amazon.

731
00:42:05,143 --> 00:42:05,766
Scott: i bought two.

732
00:42:05,847 --> 00:42:07,816
Scott: at the time i bought it because i thought i'd have to replace it.

733
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,223
Scott: it's been over a year.

734
00:42:09,283 --> 00:42:10,087
Scott: it is still perfect.

735
00:42:10,288 --> 00:42:11,794
Scott: nice it is best shower curtain.

736
00:42:11,834 --> 00:42:13,320
Scott: it just never gets nasty ever.

737
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:14,826
Scott: it's like the perfect.

738
00:42:14,926 --> 00:42:15,910
Scott: oh my god it's unbelievable.

739
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:20,008
Rym: so there's the other question of like do not track and all these things.

740
00:42:22,212 --> 00:42:25,101
Rym: right now they're just cookies that i voluntarily accept.

741
00:42:25,803 --> 00:42:27,488
Rym: it's trivial to stop that stuff.

742
00:42:27,768 --> 00:42:28,752
Scott: yeah like just be like.

743
00:42:28,772 --> 00:42:30,300
Scott: disable all third-party cookies done.

744
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:38,750
Rym: and also i think there's an inherent right that if i get media media is coming into me somehow like a website or something i can reformat that.

745
00:42:41,854 --> 00:42:43,358
Rym: so i don't think anyone has any.

746
00:42:43,378 --> 00:42:51,108
Rym: i mean if youtube really went off the hook with their uh overlay like bottom ads maybe i just make a thing that blurred them out so i didn't see it.

747
00:42:51,148 --> 00:42:51,992
Scott: well the thing is right.

748
00:42:52,032 --> 00:42:58,342
Scott: is you think you block a cookie right but the do not track the what it's supposed to do is there are so many different ways to track someone.

749
00:42:58,663 --> 00:43:01,614
Scott: people have made these technology demonstrations of like.

750
00:43:01,915 --> 00:43:03,420
Scott: you know the invince a cookie.

751
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:12,206
Scott: it's like it uses every method conceivable to try to keep some identification in your browser so that you can go to this site.

752
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:17,023
Scott: it'll hit you and then any other site you go to if it's got the code on it.

753
00:43:17,244 --> 00:43:19,775
Scott: they know that it was the same you from the last site.

754
00:43:19,815 --> 00:43:35,005
Scott: because even if you deleted the cookies and deleted this and deleted that they still have something in there where they can identify you and when they see get identify you they fill every possible thing back up again so you can delete everything again because they you know they put it in the in-browser database they put it in the cookies they put it in.

755
00:43:35,025 --> 00:43:38,417
Rym: the makers were serious about it.

756
00:43:39,381 --> 00:43:45,543
Scott: they could fight a really good fight to prevent that from working but it would also ruin a lot of other useful browser technologies.

757
00:43:45,924 --> 00:43:46,627
Rym: i would give them up.

758
00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:50,283
Scott: no you know you'd be surprised how much you depend on those.

759
00:43:50,303 --> 00:43:56,010
Rym: yeah the thing is you know what i did in the old days before there was a reliable ad block you had like yes no yes no every single.

760
00:43:56,351 --> 00:43:56,973
Rym: yeah i had it.

761
00:43:57,013 --> 00:44:11,129
Rym: basically i had a blacklist by default on all images and all flash and everything and if i went to a website and i wanted to see its content i would whitelist either specific elements or specific classes of elements for those individual websites.

762
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:12,836
Scott: but you gotta admit that's a pretty horrible experience.

763
00:44:13,177 --> 00:44:26,629
Rym: uh actually it wasn't because i as i learned i only went to about 20 websites on a regular basis and those websites i whitelisted like right away and very rarely did i go somewhere where i'd run into something but like oh i can't see something.

764
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,403
Rym: granted you had the problem where you didn't know.

765
00:44:29,443 --> 00:44:31,853
Rym: there were images in kingdom of loathing that's true.

766
00:44:31,893 --> 00:44:33,117
Scott: they got ad blocked.

767
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,083
Rym: that's so sad.

768
00:44:35,103 --> 00:44:36,126
Rym: you never got to see the lick.

769
00:44:36,888 --> 00:44:37,711
Scott: i just saw the word lick.

770
00:44:37,731 --> 00:44:38,173
Scott: that's enough.

771
00:44:38,234 --> 00:44:39,560
Rym: you didn't get to see the actual lick.

772
00:44:39,681 --> 00:44:40,987
Rym: was you good it was.

773
00:44:41,027 --> 00:44:42,233
Scott: i'm gonna search for him right now.

774
00:44:42,293 --> 00:44:43,558
Rym: i don't actually remember what he looked like.

775
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,814
Rym: i'm looking for him and this guy the uh the smobbies.

776
00:44:47,834 --> 00:44:52,607
Rym: uh scott there's meat in kingdom of loathing is there?

777
00:44:52,687 --> 00:44:53,710
Scott: yes i'm getting it.

778
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:54,473
Rym: there's lots of meat.

779
00:44:54,513 --> 00:44:55,417
Rym: remember the meat car.

780
00:44:55,437 --> 00:44:57,285
Rym: yeah i guess made the meat.

781
00:44:57,466 --> 00:45:05,734
Rym: you made the meat engine by combining the meat with the i think the transaxle or something and then you combine that with more meat to make it getting off topic here.

782
00:45:05,774 --> 00:45:07,559
Rym: car meat okay.

783
00:45:08,963 --> 00:45:09,905
Rym: so what do we do with all this?

784
00:45:10,386 --> 00:45:18,437
Scott: i mean the point is this guy was like oh man if you if you know if companies actually respected do not track and everyone said don't track me.

785
00:45:18,457 --> 00:45:23,717
Scott: add companies and add sellers and add buyers wouldn't be able to make as much money or sell more products.

786
00:45:23,878 --> 00:45:24,882
Rym: no they'd go back to the 2000s.

787
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:25,464
Rym: and then you know

788
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:40,815
Scott: then people who make content on the internet and pay for that content with ads wouldn't be able to keep making that content because they wouldn't make enough monies and all the free content on the internet would have to be paid for and you know walled off like new york times or whatever behind pay walls.

789
00:45:40,835 --> 00:45:46,799
Scott: because the people making the content and it's like dude most like i said most of the content is free with no ads anyway.

790
00:45:47,321 --> 00:45:51,278
Scott: it's like these people think like the only content that's out there that's worth looking at.

791
00:45:51,479 --> 00:45:59,086
Rym: is the people who bring this stuff up are usually the like the seo types or they're the people who like they run they talk about?

792
00:45:59,427 --> 00:46:01,354
Rym: well you want to make money on the internet.

793
00:46:01,374 --> 00:46:03,241
Rym: here's how to monetize your blog.

794
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:08,762
Scott: it's like yeah uh what about all these people who just don't try to monetize most of everybody?

795
00:46:08,782 --> 00:46:13,643
Rym: i mean advertisers approach us pretty occasionally and scott usually responds with the same response we give to everyone.

796
00:46:14,106 --> 00:46:15,814
Rym: can you give me enough money for my life to change?

797
00:46:16,115 --> 00:46:18,626
Scott: yes if you give me a life-changing amount of money.

798
00:46:18,707 --> 00:46:19,832
Scott: i'll put ads on GeekNights.

799
00:46:19,872 --> 00:46:28,148
Rym: otherwise no i mean the first thing i did in my youtube account for GeekNights was turn off all advertising for all videos and disable any monetization whatsoever.

800
00:46:28,389 --> 00:46:34,303
Rym: yep oh well yeah i just i really don't know what the end game is.

801
00:46:34,344 --> 00:46:37,695
Rym: i don't know if ad block is gonna reach this kind of like.

802
00:46:38,076 --> 00:46:39,722
Scott: i think it's gonna be ubiquity or not.

803
00:46:39,762 --> 00:46:52,530
Rym: because another side thing is there have been issues with you know telemarketers and the do not call list apparently actually really hurt a lot of companies that made a ton of money preying mostly on the elderly.

804
00:46:53,654 --> 00:46:57,890
Rym: and there are people who actually will buy more stuff if they're subjected to ads.

805
00:46:58,272 --> 00:47:01,950
Rym: but if they have the ability to opt out of those ads then they don't buy as much stuff.

806
00:47:02,251 --> 00:47:02,773
Scott: that is true.

807
00:47:03,274 --> 00:47:06,285
Rym: but whose rights are there in that situation?

808
00:47:06,346 --> 00:47:10,061
Rym: is it the right of the person to opt out or the right of the advertiser to contact the person?

809
00:47:10,523 --> 00:47:15,003
Scott: and it's it's tough right it's like okay maybe we can save that person some money in the short term.

810
00:47:15,064 --> 00:47:17,233
Scott: right because they won't be wasting it on bullshit they don't want.

811
00:47:17,615 --> 00:47:21,570
Scott: but if we manage to like save all the people in that situation.

812
00:47:21,892 --> 00:47:24,590
Scott: it'll actually hurt the economy which might end up hurting those people more.

813
00:47:24,991 --> 00:47:27,482
Scott: but i saw another study for those people to waste their money.

814
00:47:27,723 --> 00:47:31,458
Rym: i saw another study collected like 2002 or three at rit.

815
00:47:31,478 --> 00:47:45,151
Rym: i even had to write a paper on it and it was in my hci class human computer interaction like interface design and all that and it showed that older people who were using the internet really wanted ad block and stuff because they clicked on ads they didn't want to like.

816
00:47:45,171 --> 00:47:51,174
Rym: they wanted to avoid ads and spam because they were afraid they'd buy stuff and they couldn't ignore ads.

817
00:47:51,736 --> 00:47:55,246
Rym: young people didn't even see the ads ad blocker no like.

818
00:47:55,427 --> 00:47:56,651
Rym: they just glossed over them.

819
00:47:56,932 --> 00:48:06,413
Rym: and it got to the point where if you designed a website where the button to like do a thing that the website act like you actually wanted to do looked even vaguely like an ad kids could not find it.

820
00:48:06,734 --> 00:48:08,141
Rym: yep now not they didn't have.

821
00:48:08,161 --> 00:48:08,865
Rym: they had no ad block.

822
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:09,990
Rym: this was a controlled situation.

823
00:48:10,311 --> 00:48:15,150
Rym: they literally just blocked out in their brain anything that looked remotely like an advertisement.

824
00:48:15,971 --> 00:48:17,418
Rym: so maybe that's the end game.

825
00:48:17,438 --> 00:48:19,367
Scott: i don't think this is going to be any game.

826
00:48:19,427 --> 00:48:26,097
Scott: actually this is one of the weird situations where i'm going to say you know what's going to happen maintaining of status quo for a very very long time.

827
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:31,321
Scott: i i see all these flaws all over the place that everyone else sees but i don't think anything's going to happen.

828
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:32,449
Scott: i think it's just going to keep going.

829
00:48:32,469 --> 00:48:32,871
Scott: it's been going.

830
00:48:32,891 --> 00:48:34,378
Scott: everyone's going to keep spending money on ads.

831
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:37,852
Scott: putting money putting ads i think i just agree.

832
00:48:38,033 --> 00:48:48,666
Rym: i think for a very long time within the next 30 years y plus 30 there's going to be a crisis in the advertising supported business model across the western world.

833
00:48:48,686 --> 00:48:49,428
Scott: i don't think so.

834
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:50,593
Rym: i think there's going to.

835
00:48:50,634 --> 00:49:02,121
Scott: as long as companies have a lot of money they will all and you know because anyone who wants to get ideas out in the world has money they will continue to spend that money to put their message into the world.

836
00:49:02,382 --> 00:49:08,038
Rym: because the santorum thing you know that that disgusting word that also happens to be the name of uh a disgusting guy.

837
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:20,219
Rym: so super packs spend untold millions of dollars to try to plant ideas like that in the populace with a pretty good you know level of success there are.

838
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:32,118
Rym: now there's a storm of articles funded by a lot of these organizations the people who support them trying to say that google and internet people are unfairly using their power to do things like this.

839
00:49:32,158 --> 00:49:34,607
Rym: you know the santorum quote-unquote smear campaign.

840
00:49:34,929 --> 00:49:46,271
Rym: okay not that anyone wants to think about a smear of santorum new and that it's unfair and that you know there should be regulation to prevent that sort of like bombing of people's identity online or whatever.

841
00:49:46,954 --> 00:49:52,972
Rym: but i think that itself is astroturfing trying to cover up for the fact that look what happened there?

842
00:49:52,992 --> 00:50:00,219
Rym: dan savage basically without a super pack and without spending millions of dollars did in 10 minutes what it takes.

843
00:50:00,479 --> 00:50:08,102
Rym: someone old school trying to put a fake like top down meme into the population 10 million dollars to do so.

844
00:50:08,282 --> 00:50:20,605
Rym: i think the dan savage type stuff is going to more and more powerful and i don't think the old media can keep up because the cost of planting memes in tech savvy people is going up at an exponential rate.

845
00:50:20,645 --> 00:50:22,994
Scott: and here's the thing what is advertising right?

846
00:50:23,275 --> 00:50:28,112
Scott: advertising now is like this specific spots for it right and it's like this sort of.

847
00:50:28,494 --> 00:50:30,160
Scott: you can see that it's like advertising.

848
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:32,349
Scott: i think the advertising the future is simply.

849
00:50:32,389 --> 00:50:33,873
Scott: look there is content.

850
00:50:34,254 --> 00:50:35,818
Scott: it's all pull content right.

851
00:50:36,058 --> 00:50:37,181
Scott: it's not going to be so much pushing.

852
00:50:37,221 --> 00:50:37,602
Scott: it's going to be.

853
00:50:40,991 --> 00:50:42,137
Scott: content is going to be popular.

854
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:45,752
Scott: certain content is going to be unpopular and content is just information.

855
00:50:46,313 --> 00:50:54,618
Scott: so advertising is just going to be hey i want to no one's looking at my information because there's so much information in the world.

856
00:50:54,638 --> 00:50:59,517
Scott: i will give you money if you put my information and attach it to your information.

857
00:50:59,617 --> 00:51:02,087
Scott: that's pretty much the fundamental thing that it is now.

858
00:51:02,669 --> 00:51:14,729
Scott: so you know if your dan savage is so good that he can get the messages out there he's going there going to be people who pay him a lot of money to get messages but then with his messages.

859
00:51:14,769 --> 00:51:20,773
Rym: but then there's the penny arcade situation of the only reason their voice is so powerful because their voice is trusted.

860
00:51:21,134 --> 00:51:29,810
Scott: if they ever backed a game that was really shitty like for real yeah but that's gonna be yeah but you're just assuming that anyone who pays to get a message out there is shitty.

861
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:33,530
Scott: there's gonna be plenty of people who aren't shitty paying to get their message out here.

862
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:43,640
Rym: but here's the question if someone who's not shitty is paying for the message to get out there the person who's getting the message out there if they agree with the message is basically getting free money because they were likely to spread that message anyway.

863
00:51:44,604 --> 00:51:45,428
Scott: well maybe they weren't.

864
00:51:45,448 --> 00:51:47,276
Rym: i mean how much burning wheel did we sell right?

865
00:51:47,336 --> 00:51:49,484
Scott: or yeah but the thing is how you know.

866
00:51:49,664 --> 00:51:54,247
Scott: if he had paid us money we would mention the burning wheel in every episode instead of every other episode.

867
00:51:54,307 --> 00:51:54,710
Scott: yeah you would.

868
00:51:55,131 --> 00:51:55,513
Scott: you know it.

869
00:51:55,974 --> 00:51:56,938
Scott: it's you get.

870
00:51:57,058 --> 00:51:58,182
Scott: there's something extra.

871
00:51:58,483 --> 00:52:00,892
Scott: you know when you pay someone the monies you get them to do it.

872
00:52:00,912 --> 00:52:01,777
Rym: i don't think that's the real.

873
00:52:01,797 --> 00:52:03,205
Scott: they're reminded to do it.

874
00:52:03,346 --> 00:52:04,431
Rym: i think it'll get even more subtle.

875
00:52:04,451 --> 00:52:18,803
Rym: i think the real future is what we're seeing now with politics of the massive orchestrated astroturfing campaigns complete with entire armies of fake profiles making fake friendships in forums and acting like real people with these fake identities.

876
00:52:18,843 --> 00:52:22,277
Scott: i mean you got you got fake amazon reviews fake new egg reviews.

877
00:52:22,338 --> 00:52:23,321
Scott: you got fake everything.

878
00:52:23,602 --> 00:52:28,099
Rym: so but then google's gonna probably step in with the algorithms to weed out the fake.

879
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,348
Scott: no that's really hard to do.

880
00:52:30,388 --> 00:52:32,557
Scott: they've been trying a long time and i think it'll happen.

881
00:52:32,577 --> 00:52:39,422
Rym: i think it's a big arms race but i think all that aside i think the traditional advertising model of here are ad spots.

882
00:52:40,284 --> 00:52:45,973
Rym: they are paid directly to be put in places that our ads is going to have a crisis in the next 30 years.

883
00:52:52,279 --> 00:52:58,460
Rym: this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott special thanks to dj pretzel for the opening music cat lee for web design and brand.
