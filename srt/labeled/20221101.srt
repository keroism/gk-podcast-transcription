00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,095
Rym: It's Tuesday, November 1st, 2022.

2
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:14,344
Rym: I'm Rym, and I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:14,384 --> 00:00:17,230
Rym: Tonight, we are reviewing Marvel Snap.

4
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,388
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:32,670
Scott: So, Scott at the Scott household, you guys hosted a minor Friends Halloween gathering, and I gotta say, you're- We decided, well, we did it once before, and we're like, alright, let's just make that our thing, right, you know.

6
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:48,870
Scott: I like that being your thing, diversify the things, but your costume was an appropriately funny one, and- Well, 'cause, you know, I had, you know, I'm not a person, you know, I appreciate a cosplay, right, but obviously, that's not my hobby, I don't got time for that, right?

7
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:52,070
Scott: So, if I'm gonna wear a costume, I'm going to purchase it, right?

8
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,910
Rym: Yep, you're not gonna go the level below to what I might have worn at RIT back in the day.

9
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:10,250
Scott: Yeah, so, I had a Pusheen onesie, and I was like, oh, well, I have this, I might as well- I kept using it as a costume whenever I needed one, but the problem is, it was too small, mostly 'cause my arms are too long, right?

10
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,020
Rym: Well, there's a secondary problem, 'cause I've used my equivalents.

11
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,230
Rym: Yeah, they are way too warm for 90% of circumstances.

12
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:34,910
Scott: Yeah, so anyway, I was using that, and I'm like, alright, that's enough of the Pusheen onesie, let's get something else, and I said, alright, if I'm gonna get something, it's either gonna be cheap and disposable, or it's gonna be reusable, like the Pusheen was, right?

13
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:45,121
Scott: So, I was looking around, looking around, and I was like, oh, I could get this, you know, skeleton, basically spandex deal, right?

14
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:53,290
Scott: It was pretty high quality, it wasn't cheap either, but I could just use that every year, and just get a different kind of skeleton, right?

15
00:01:53,350 --> 00:02:03,083
Scott: I would apply, on top of the expensive reusable skeleton costume, right, some skeleton flavor that is cheap and disposable, right?

16
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:08,630
Scott: So I started with the very straightforward pirate skeleton, and it looked better than I thought it was gonna look.

17
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:12,655
Rym: I think the fact that the jaw actually sort of moved separately from the rest of it.

18
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:35,210
Scott: And it worked, I'm like, alright, got a skeleton, you know, so those two parts I can reuse, and now next year, you know, I'll be a different kind of skeleton, and I'll just keep being a different kind of skeleton forever.

19
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:47,390
Rym: Yep, Emily and I went relatively low rent, I was gonna get it make a better, like more realistic Star Trek costume, but despite ordering a bunch of parts, like shirt, like things way in advance, none of them arrived by Halloween.

20
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,134
Rym: So, I ended up wearing, basically, a Star Trek costume.

21
00:02:52,154 --> 00:03:11,170
Rym: if you're going low rent is just a cheap shirt, so I had a cheap shirt, and it looked okay in photos, but in person, it was the same material that like, bottom of the barrel sportswear is made out of, like bad knit polyester, that is definitely the kind of fabric that will smell like a gym locker within two seconds of touching flesh.

22
00:03:13,371 --> 00:03:24,010
Rym: But, I will get a better one, I gotta say though, our friend Kat, he really knocked out of the park in terms of Star Trek, because not only was he wearing a real shirt, but he dressed up as Data's painting from the meme.

23
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:35,762
Scott: Very, oh, one of those, I mean, I don't know what the meme is, but I guess that's one of those, like, one episode- How do you know, we've watched this in your presence, Data's painting is making me dizzy.

24
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:39,050
Rym: I like being strong, that's where I like being strong comes from.

25
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:42,030
Scott: I mean, I know the character Data is like the emotionless robot guy.

26
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:52,790
Rym: Alright, so, all I'll say is there is a short, meme-y internet video where someone took an episode of Star Trek, which is a normal episode where Data starts painting, like he makes paintings.

27
00:03:53,251 --> 00:04:03,690
Rym: And independently, Worf, the Klingon guy, is disturbed by and feels sick because of, among other things, Data's painting.

28
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:10,610
Rym: And they cut this together, and they replace the paintings with terrifying furry fetish art.

29
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:11,939
Scott: Alright.

30
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:21,269
Rym: And it's, like, a minute long, and it's moderately funny, and that is why, in the private Discord, there is an emoji of a horse that is called Strong.

31
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:22,967
Rym: And I'll leave it at that.

32
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,837
Scott: Alright, but, you know, the point is, I love those, I like the one episode deals, right?

33
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:33,802
Scott: It's like, you know, who wants to, you could be a Spider-Man costume, right?

34
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:47,810
Rym: My favorite thing to do if I was going to dress up, like, at anime cons as an adult would be the minorest possible background character from something.

35
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,727
Scott: Yeah, but definitely, but, like, distinctly, that, you know, you could be a Fish-Man from Slayers, right?

36
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:54,450
Scott: It's like, you know.

37
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,473
Rym: No, you know what it's like?

38
00:04:55,493 --> 00:05:00,010
Rym: It's the difference between being Alan Chazar versus being Cliff Chazar.

39
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:10,450
Rym: So, in the news, in a recent competitive professional game, you may have heard of this game, it's called NASCAR.

40
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:16,461
Scott: Well, NASCAR is the league, the sport is stock car racing.

41
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:20,350
Scott: Even though the cars they use are far from stock.

42
00:05:21,252 --> 00:05:25,509
Rym: So, did you know, total aside, it bothers me now that I realize this.

43
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:34,430
Rym: A ball bearing refers to, ball bearing refers to the collection of ball bearings in the bearing, and also to the individual balls in the ball bearing.

44
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,410
Rym: They are both called ball bearings.

45
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:43,988
Rym: Pedants are trying to call the balls inside bearing balls, which would make sense, but literally no one does that.

46
00:05:44,188 --> 00:05:44,930
Rym: It's all ball bearings.

47
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,854
Rym: It's all NASCAR, it's all Legos.

48
00:05:46,974 --> 00:05:52,649
Rym: Anyway, I'm just going to read the headline, then we'll talk about the news, because this headline on Kotaku tells you everything you need to know.

49
00:05:53,131 --> 00:05:58,489
Rym: Quote, "Nascar driver pulls some video game shit, thanks GameCube, an interview

50
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,850
Rym: afterward.".

51
00:05:59,831 --> 00:06:01,856
Scott: Right, so here's the actual story, right?

52
00:06:01,937 --> 00:06:06,410
Scott: So, they're racing, it's the second to last race of NASCAR for this year, right?

53
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:14,330
Scott: So, the way NASCAR works now, I don't know all the rules of it, because I haven't paid attention to it in decades, since like the last millennia, right?

54
00:06:14,611 --> 00:06:16,050
Rym: High school was the last time I paid attention.

55
00:06:16,612 --> 00:06:21,509
Scott: Yeah, way back in the day, the way it worked is you would just get points, like any other, like F1, right?

56
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,210
Scott: And whoever had the most points at the end of the season was the champion, right?

57
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:33,468
Scott: Now, there's actually some sort of tournament structures, where like at the final race, there's only four people who actually have like a chance to win, right?

58
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:34,130
Scott: They're in the showdown.

59
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:43,229
Scott: So, this guy, who was racing, he was coming, it was one of those tracks that's really short with high banks, almost like a velodrome for cars, right?

60
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:48,830
Scott: And those are a lot of fun, even though you're basically, like you talk about NASCAR, they're just going around in circles.

61
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,549
Rym: On this track, they're just going around in circles.

62
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,457
Scott: They are really just going around in circles, right?

63
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:55,921
Scott: Like really, it's so short.

64
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:59,670
Scott: Anyway, but there's some fun aspects to that, right?

65
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:13,310
Scott: There's a lot of, the cars are all bunched up all the time, you know, you're not like, if you go to watch one of those races, you can see all the cars at once going around in this, you know, as opposed to like you go to some other big track, and it's like a car will come, and then you sit and wait, and then some cars come, right?

66
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:31,366
Rym: And also, while the sport zoomed out, looks like just a mess of cars kind of going in a circle, and I'm not a fan of NASCAR, NASCAR Super, really, but zoom in and like watch a dash cam for one car, and there's a lot of micro-aggression nonsense, like fighting and bumping and jockeying for position.

67
00:07:31,646 --> 00:07:33,250
Rym: There's a lot of skill involved in NASCAR.

68
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,449
Scott: There's a lot worse sports, but it's not the best.

69
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,091
Rym: Right.

70
00:07:37,172 --> 00:07:41,719
Scott: So anyway, so this guy's in 10th place on the second to last lap.

71
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:51,256
Scott: In order for him to qualify to be one of the four people who could win the championship at the next race, he's got to do better than 10th place, right?

72
00:07:51,316 --> 00:07:52,458
Scott: 10th isn't going to be good enough.

73
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,470
Scott: So what reason is there for this guy to not just put it all on the line?

74
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,757
Scott: If worst case, he crashes, as long as he doesn't die, right?

75
00:08:00,837 --> 00:08:05,408
Scott: If he ruins the car, if he comes in last place, what does it matter, right?

76
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:06,530
Scott: That doesn't matter.

77
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,710
Scott: As long as he doesn't die.

78
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:08,851
Scott: Right.

79
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:13,570
Scott: As long as he doesn't die or hurt anyone else, it literally doesn't matter, right?

80
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:29,856
Scott: So the typical driving pattern on these bold tracks, right, is to take the outside of the track, right, close to the wall when you're on the straightaway, which is very brief on this tiny track, and then dip in, you know, cause it's banked, right?

81
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:39,390
Scott: So you go down low, right, to the low part of the track to go around the corner and then go back up to the, you know, go back up the wall again and basically bank up and down and up and down and so right.

82
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,095
Scott: And that's basically over the long run.

83
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:50,630
Scott: That's the fastest way to go around the track because, you know, it's like, yeah, you have to lower your speed to get down into the banks, but you're taking the shortest path, right?

84
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:57,290
Scott: If you just tried to go around the outside of the track the whole time, you're taking such a long path compared to everyone else.

85
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:02,470
Rym: Yeah, you're literally driving further in a race, like doing extra laps, like the penalty laps in a biathlon.

86
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:03,751
Scott: Exactly.

87
00:09:03,771 --> 00:09:05,115
Scott: It's not a good idea, right?

88
00:09:05,215 --> 00:09:06,358
Scott: But what does this guy do?

89
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:11,110
Scott: Well, according to him, there's a trick he learned on GameCube NASCAR.

90
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,972
Rym: I'm gonna quote him from the interview.

91
00:09:13,293 --> 00:09:18,119
Rym: "I played a lot of NASCAR 2005 on the GameCube, which I had growing up.

92
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,785
Rym: You could get away with it in the game, and I never knew if it would actually work.

93
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:25,309
Rym: I mean, I did that when I was eight years

94
00:09:25,469 --> 00:09:25,589
Rym: old.".

95
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,657
Scott: Yep, so when he was eight years old when we were in college, a young dude, right?

96
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:35,410
Scott: He basically, on the last lap, he floors it, obviously, that's clear strategy.

97
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,570
Rym: Yeah, take the most aggressive, most dangerous line, just go nuts.

98
00:09:38,991 --> 00:09:46,383
Scott: Right, but if you're flooring it on a track like this, right, you can't get down into the bottom of the turn, right?

99
00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:50,530
Scott: You know, because of the, you know, whatever it's called.

100
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,579
Rym: You're gonna be understeering.

101
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:56,610
Rym: You won't be able to just turn in without spinning out.

102
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:57,831
Scott: Exactly.

103
00:09:57,911 --> 00:10:02,740
Scott: So, rather than go down, which he can't do anyway, because this car's there in the way, right?

104
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:07,688
Scott: When you're going around the turn, there's no cars up at the top, because who's going up there?

105
00:10:07,728 --> 00:10:08,610
Scott: Nobody, right?

106
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:10,852
Rym: But he guns it on the last lap.

107
00:10:10,872 --> 00:10:11,994
Rym: He kind of bumps out of the way.

108
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:13,457
Scott: A little bit, yeah.

109
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,421
Scott: But he guns it on the last lap.

110
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:20,350
Scott: He takes the high road up by the wall around the whole turn.

111
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,194
Scott: So, he's going on a longer course around, right?

112
00:10:23,214 --> 00:10:33,370
Scott: He's covering more total ground, but he's going so much faster by not hitting the brakes to go into the turn, and he's tearing up the side of his car, right, on the wall.

113
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,396
Rym: Yeah, he has rammed the wall, and he's just riding it.

114
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:39,710
Rym: He said in the interview, he kind of just let go of the wheel, and held the accelerator down.

115
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,498
Scott: Right, it's like he's destroying his car.

116
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:45,810
Scott: You can't do this every lap, otherwise your car would disappear, right?

117
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,330
Rym: Car looks like it's starting to struggle just as it gets over the finish line, too.

118
00:10:50,390 --> 00:11:00,470
Scott: Yeah, I mean, Porsche, the person who is named Porsche, I don't know his first name, right, who the car is named after, said, like, the ideal race car should cross the finish line and then fall apart, right?

119
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,690
Rym: Blues Brothers car style.

120
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,012
Scott: Exactly.

121
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:05,637
Scott: So, this dude, he does exactly that.

122
00:11:05,738 --> 00:11:11,310
Scott: On the last lap, not even on both turns, only on the last turn, the last two turns technically, right?

123
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:22,850
Scott: But, of the last lap, he guns it, he grinds the car against the wall, he's going, even though he's going further distance-wise, his speed is so much faster than the cars that are braking.

124
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:28,328
Rym: He passes, like, one, two, three, four, five, six, he passes so many people in that seven seconds.

125
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:40,190
Scott: He goes from tenth to fifth place on the final lap, which is, by the way, enough to get him in to possibly win the championship next race.

126
00:11:40,832 --> 00:11:47,970
Scott: Also, he eliminated someone, someone who was in, who could have won the championship next race, is now eliminated from championship convention.

127
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:52,310
Rym: Even better, he had the best lap time for the final lap because of that.

128
00:11:52,890 --> 00:12:01,049
Scott: No, no, no, he had the best lap time ever on this track by a tenth of a second, period.

129
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:01,590
Scott: Ever.

130
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:06,847
Rym: Oh, my article didn't say that, it just said he beat the best final lap time by 2.5 seconds.

131
00:12:08,151 --> 00:12:08,712
Scott: No, no, no.

132
00:12:08,872 --> 00:12:10,955
Scott: By, well, final lap time by 2.5.

133
00:12:10,955 --> 00:12:19,690
Scott: He had the track record for fastest lap in qualifying in a race ever, at least for this kind of car, right?

134
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,153
Scott: By a tenth of a second.

135
00:12:21,414 --> 00:12:28,670
Scott: So, like, someone who was trying to qualify and get pole position and got pole position on an empty track on this, in this, right?

136
00:12:29,771 --> 00:12:34,043
Scott: This guy on the final lap was faster than that by a tenth of a second.

137
00:12:34,123 --> 00:12:36,630
Scott: The fastest ever, right?

138
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:44,810
Rym: It is amazing that no one tried this before, but maybe it's not that amazing because the dude literally got the idea from the Game of Cube.

139
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,636
Scott: Yeah, but, you know, it's like a player of games, perfect, right?

140
00:12:49,756 --> 00:12:58,230
Scott: But, now that people have seen this, right, is everyone, obviously not on the pre-final lap because you ruined your car, right?

141
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:07,770
Scott: I mean, you'll be out of the race, but why wouldn't everyone, no, you'd ruin your car, but on the final lap of the race, isn't everyone going to do this?

142
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:29,833
Rym: So then, it will become, just like when you, me, and our friends pay El Grande, where everyone's trying to position themselves for the exact same endgame, the 2.1.13, but everyone knows everyone's trying to do it, so the arts can be- You won't pass anybody, right?

143
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:31,717
Scott: And it'll be really interesting.

144
00:13:31,817 --> 00:13:34,863
Scott: So, I also wonder, and also it's track-specific.

145
00:13:34,903 --> 00:13:36,747
Scott: I mean, there are other short tracks, like.

146
00:13:36,787 --> 00:13:38,390
Scott: I think Bristol is another one.

147
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:44,890
Rym: Well, it's track-specific the same way that in Initial D, Takumi's Hug the Gutter is track-specific.

148
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:45,992
Scott: Exactly.

149
00:13:46,032 --> 00:13:51,970
Scott: There might, though, be other tracks where, you know, even though they're not these sort of, you know, bowl tracks, right?

150
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,250
Rym: But there might be other types of strategies like this that everyone's avoided.

151
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,687
Scott: Have a final, like a turn on the final lap where, like, you know, it's just like, "Fuck

152
00:13:59,748 --> 00:13:59,808
Scott: it.".

153
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,194
Rym: There might be other types of strategies.

154
00:14:02,234 --> 00:14:07,164
Rym: There might be a chicane where you could, like, bounce your rear end off of the second half of it to spin around.

155
00:14:07,204 --> 00:14:17,110
Scott: Like, there's lots of crap people could start trying now that no one's- I mean, in other sports, we've already seen just so many years of, you know, development and destruction of orthodoxy.

156
00:14:17,251 --> 00:14:20,030
Rym: Yeah, nobody's made a new football play in a while.

157
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:25,562
Scott: Yeah, you know, like, you know, basketball, we've seen people finally just embrace the three-pointer.

158
00:14:25,582 --> 00:14:28,610
Scott: It took them a long time to finally just go for that, right?

159
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:32,949
Scott: You know, a few decades that they had the three-pointer before they said, "Oh, that's that three points is better than

160
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:33,089
Scott: two.".

161
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:36,470
Scott: I mean, baseball- Why didn't you do that in the 80s or 90s when they added the three-pointer?

162
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,958
Rym: Baseball had a million clever trick plays that were all eventually destroyed by the true outcomes.

163
00:14:41,058 --> 00:14:47,890
Rym: Like, every sport, every major sport, and most car racing has hit sort of these terminal strategies for their current rule sets.

164
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:50,467
Rym: And out of nowhere, this dude is like, "Well, there's a new

165
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:50,729
Rym: meta.".

166
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,684
Scott: The ABA added the three-pointer in '61.

167
00:14:55,884 --> 00:15:05,339
Scott: Yeah, the NBA added the three-pointer in 1979, and it wasn't until, like, the 2000s that people were doing, you know, like, really focusing on it, right?

168
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:05,960
Scott: A whole lot.

169
00:15:07,982 --> 00:15:26,178
Rym: So, in some other news, you may remember that Embracer, the company that is embracing basically the entire nerd media world bit by bit, conglomerating all together, that they had bought Square Enix Montreal, which rebranded itself.

170
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,860
Rym: That was the news from October.

171
00:15:28,381 --> 00:15:40,280
Rym: So, not that long ago, the news from October 10th was Square Enix Montreal, having been bought by Embracer, rebranded itself as Onoma to continue making games with a new brand, and they ta-.

172
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,893
Rym: There's this article I'm gonna link to where they talked about, "We're making sequels, remakes, and remasters.

173
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:48,720
Rym: We're gonna go after Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Thief, and a few other

174
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:48,920
Rym: things.".

175
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:51,526
Rym: It is now November 1st.

176
00:15:51,787 --> 00:15:54,773
Rym: It is a few weeks after that announcement.

177
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:57,620
Rym: Embracer is shutting down that studio entirely.

178
00:15:58,803 --> 00:15:59,918
Scott: Alright, well, they embraced it.

179
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:19,280
Rym: I, my cynical guess, I don't have any information, this is a pure opinion-based guess, just to clarify that, is that Embracer really, really convinced the people at this studio to rebrand so that the news wouldn't be Square Enix shuts down in Montreal.

180
00:16:20,182 --> 00:16:26,720
Rym: The news was Onoma, something no one's heard about, shut down, and everyone kind of forgets what happened.

181
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:34,880
Scott: I don't think it's that, because it's like, you know, if it's no longer owned, if I were to buy Square Enix, I don't know, New York, right?

182
00:16:35,721 --> 00:16:43,480
Scott: And Square Enix officially, the company in Japan, still exists, I'm sort of required to change the name to avoid trademark infringement, right?

183
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,510
Scott: Regardless of whether I'm gonna shut it down or not.

184
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:47,320
Scott: I can't keep calling it that.

185
00:16:47,501 --> 00:16:49,960
Rym: Depending on the terms of the deal, of course.

186
00:16:50,981 --> 00:16:57,680
Scott: Right, like if you bought Nintendo of America for some reason, you wanted to own a marketing customer service company, right?

187
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,800
Scott: Even though Nintendo of Japan still existed, you couldn't keep calling it Nintendo of America.

188
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:14,540
Rym: So case in point, a long time ago, I worked for a company called Pipeline Financial, and they, when they were shutting down, renamed themselves for a bunch of reasons to sort of just disappear into obscurity.

189
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,903
Rym: Like, that happens all the time.

190
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:25,079
Rym: They didn't just rename it, they did a big rebranding, announced projects, and like, made a big deal about like, this is what we're gonna do under this new brand.

191
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:34,260
Rym: But I'm pretty, my guess would be that that was all just Embracer trying to keep them from imploding until they actually shut them down, and the plan was to shut them down all along.

192
00:17:36,741 --> 00:17:50,619
Rym: You may remember that Embracer, not that long ago, also bought Asmode and Dark Horse, and they are one more of the hyper-capitalist conglomerate threats to all entertainment media.

193
00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:51,660
Rym: I don't know what to do about this.

194
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,319
Rym: It's not like our government's gonna do any antitrust anytime soon.

195
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,499
Scott: Well, it's a Swedish company, but Sweden's going in the wrong direction right now, so...

196
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,760
Rym: Yup, fascism's on the rise all over the world.

197
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:19,740
Scott: Alright, so, in another news, right, we all know here on GeekNights, we all know about Dwarf Fortress, right, we interviewed, one of the few people who has been interviewed on our podcast is Tarn Adams, the creator of Dwarf Fortress, back in the year 2006.

198
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,759
Scott: That was a long time ago.

199
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:34,096
Scott: Ancient times, right, and Dwarf Fortress is infamous, but it's managed to keep existing for like, you know, about as long as GeekNights has existed, Dwarf Fortress has also existed, and it's vastly more successful.

200
00:18:34,116 --> 00:18:36,920
Scott: Their Patreon brings in like 10k a month, right, they don't gotta work.

201
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:53,800
Scott: But anyway, so Dwarf Fortress is out there, and some while ago, right, maybe last year, year before, I forget exactly when, they teamed up with this other game studio, something Fox, something Games, I forget what it's called.

202
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,040
Scott: It's Fox something, right?

203
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:56,558
Rym: Ah, Kit Fox.

204
00:18:57,242 --> 00:18:58,299
Scott: Kit Fox, that's the one.

205
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:06,760
Scott: And basically, they're like, alright, we're gonna keep making the Dwarf Fortress, but Kit Fox, you know, we actually want to try to make some money now, not just keep giving Dwarf Fortress away for free.

206
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,419
Scott: You know, I guess they realized they wanted health insurance, right, in the United States, where they live.

207
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:38,940
Scott: And they're like, okay, we'll make a version of Dwarf Fortress that's sort of like the premium edition, but not ASCII graphics, you know, actual graphics, you know, some other fanciness, and we'll put it out on Steam and itch, and sell it for not free, and we'll keep the original ASCII Dwarf Fortress free, and that's what the state of things will be for as long as they live and keep making this game, right.

208
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:45,380
Scott: But I'm sure, even if they were to not live, someone else would carry this game, right, forward, somewhere, somehow.

209
00:19:45,704 --> 00:19:46,079
Scott: I may.

210
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,360
Scott: Anyway.

211
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,620
Rym: I'm debating making one final attempt at playing Dwarf Fortress.

212
00:19:50,500 --> 00:20:03,100
Scott: So, I'm like, alright, you know, it's like, first of all, it's been so long since I played a Dwarf Fortress, it's still Dwarf Fortress, but there had to have been so many improvements since then, and so many changes, and I've forgotten so much.

213
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:09,219
Scott: It would be like a whole new thing, and even though the quality of life is gonna be awful, it's gonna still be better than it was.

214
00:20:09,884 --> 00:20:09,980
Rym: Yup.

215
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:19,420
Rym: 'Cause what it was, I enjoyed talking to all of you when you were trying to play it, but I bounced off hard, despite loving everything that it was, it was just not a game I could play.

216
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:25,280
Scott: There are a lot of people, there are a lot of people who are like super into Dwarf Fortress, that's their number one thing, and they never play it.

217
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,120
Scott: All they do is watch other people play it, or, you know, hang out in the communities and never actually play it themselves ever again.

218
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:41,080
Rym: I mean, and our panel at PEX West, me and Emily, we talked about Boat Murdered, like the famous, the first big, widely known Dwarf Fortress playthrough epic story that someone told.

219
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:56,280
Scott: Anyway, so, this has been, there's been a Steam page for this upgraded Dwarf Fortress, Steam edition, real money edition, it's also an itch.io, for a long time now, it's been on my wishlist.

220
00:20:56,881 --> 00:21:14,540
Scott: They announced today, literally today, right, which I didn't think this would ever happen, they put up a YouTube, like, announced date trailer, yes, it's actually going to be released on December 6th this year, so in a month and five days, it's actually coming out.

221
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:21,596
Scott: It's not like, I thought it was gonna be years more before it came out, nope, it's December 6th, 2022, it's set in stone, it's coming out.

222
00:21:23,421 --> 00:21:23,978
Rym: Set in stone.

223
00:21:24,642 --> 00:21:26,140
Scott: That's right, that's right.

224
00:21:26,941 --> 00:21:29,078
Scott: So, uh, I'm gonna play it.

225
00:21:30,464 --> 00:21:31,458
Scott: I'm gonna buy it for sure.

226
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,598
Scott: You know what, I will.

227
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,240
Scott: And I'm gonna follow my policy of buy and immediately play, and I'm also gonna buy an itch.io.

228
00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:44,339
Rym: I will do the same, and I will play it until I can't anymore, or do not want to anymore, but I will try.

229
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:52,200
Scott: Well, get some instructions, if you just try to play it straight up, it's not a good faith effort, you gotta get some instructions.

230
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,440
Rym: Yeah, yeah, I know, I wonder if that, I gotta find, do I have a bookmark for that site I used that was like the...

231
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:05,257
Scott: Well, I actually have a printed, physical, hard, you know, not a hardcover, but a book that was like a Dwarf Fortress book from back in the day.

232
00:22:05,297 --> 00:22:06,680
Scott: that was, I think, O'Reilly published.

233
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,760
Scott: But I doubt it's still correct, because it hasn't been updated in maybe a decade.

234
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,440
Rym: I'll definitely do the thing I did for, like, Hearts of Iron.

235
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,640
Scott: But I'm sure that there's a wiki with a tutorial that has everything.

236
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:23,500
Rym: Do the thing like Hearts of Iron, where you play, do one playthrough following a very scripted tutorial, that is how I learned to play Offworld Trading Company.

237
00:22:24,181 --> 00:22:30,140
Scott: If, right, if the listener knows the best Dwarf Fortress tutorial, there's probably a YouTube one, too, that you can follow, right?

238
00:22:30,302 --> 00:22:30,431
Scott: Yeah.

239
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,718
Scott: In this day and age, so...

240
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:36,820
Rym: Oh, we should play Offworld Trading Company again, too, I've forgotten everything about it, so it'd be great to play again.

241
00:22:38,302 --> 00:22:40,820
Scott: I haven't forgotten, except what goes on in the playthrough.

242
00:22:41,781 --> 00:22:45,377
Rym: I don't remember my strats, despite the fact that I seem to have, like, a 90% win rate.

243
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:48,100
Scott: Your strap was just do what the spreadsheet said.

244
00:22:48,622 --> 00:22:49,719
Scott: The spreadsheet's real good!

245
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:56,200
Rym: The thing is, every time I tried to do the slightly more advanced variants in the spreadsheet, I would crater.

246
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:57,391
Scott: Yep.

247
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:08,420
Rym: So one last little news, I don't have a lot to say about this yet, because I am reporting on this, because I did not know this was a thing game companies could do in Steam.

248
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,815
Rym: And when I pointed out to Scott, Scott also was unaware.

249
00:23:11,835 --> 00:23:12,880
Rym: this was a possibility.

250
00:23:13,321 --> 00:23:18,860
Rym: So if you don't know, in Steam, there is a feature that if you're not using it, you really should.

251
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:24,660
Rym: You can basically share games that you have bought with your household or with your family.

252
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,220
Scott: Without any security issues.

253
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,080
Rym: Yeah, like, you'll have separate cloud saves and everything.

254
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:41,000
Rym: Like, if I share a game with Emily and it does not, like, break my Slay the Spire save, Emily has her own Slay the Spire save game, they're separate, it just works, it's really good.

255
00:23:41,701 --> 00:23:49,874
Rym: And Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, just now, on October 31st, at 1621/41 UTC, released a patch.

256
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,179
Rym: And this patch does exactly one thing.

257
00:23:58,482 --> 00:24:04,460
Rym: It removes the ability to do family sharing in Steam for this game.

258
00:24:05,082 --> 00:24:05,996
Scott: It just disables that.

259
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:25,420
Scott: So on October 30th, if I had this game in my Steam library, because I bought it, and my kid had their own Steam account, and I indicated to Steam that we were in the same family, it would allow my kid to play that game on their account, even though we only bought it once on my account.

260
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,280
Scott: And I don't think it lets both people play at the same time.

261
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,940
Rym: You can't both play at the same time, which is a perfectly reasonable limitation.

262
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:45,620
Scott: Yes, but you can still, either one of you can play it, because you're literally in the same family, it would be no different than if you bought a Zelda cartridge, and you had an NES, only one person can play it at a time, but you got three save files on there.

263
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,649
Rym: And there are a few minor limitations, like, you can't play it at the same time as the other person.

264
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,894
Rym: You can't play it in offline mode.

265
00:24:53,114 --> 00:24:55,700
Rym: There's minor limitations, but it pretty much does just work.

266
00:24:56,481 --> 00:25:04,097
Scott: Yeah, so, but on October 30th, you could do that with this game, and October 31st, and today, you can't.

267
00:25:04,137 --> 00:25:05,540
Scott: You would have to buy the game twice.

268
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:17,938
Scott: Now, first of all, you can understand why a game company would think this is a good idea with their backwards capitalist mindset, but the reality is how many extra copies of the game is this going to sell?

269
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:19,120
Scott: Not many.

270
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,080
Scott: I cannot imagine that many extra copies of this game will sell.

271
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,000
Rym: Meanwhile, how many 14 year olds are going to be so mad?

272
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:36,517
Scott: Right, it's like, I can't prove that the number is going to be low, but my prediction is that the number of additional copies sold will be very low.

273
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:38,000
Scott: It won't be zero, it'll be low.

274
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:49,820
Scott: But the number of angry people, right, for example, the older sibling in a family bought the game and they used the family share, or the parent is a gamer because that's how old people are, right?

275
00:25:50,080 --> 00:26:06,260
Scott: You got millennial parent buys the game and shares it with the kids who are old enough to be allowed to play it, and suddenly those kids are cut off and only the parent has it, but the kid was the one who was playing it the most, and you can't just transfer the game over to the kid's account now, right?

276
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:13,879
Scott: But the kid has a save game and was playing it online with their friends, and now they can't, and it's like, you're going to really buy another copy, right?

277
00:26:14,765 --> 00:26:15,820
Scott: And there were games.

278
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,140
Scott: Especially if you don't have a lot of money.

279
00:26:17,481 --> 00:26:29,440
Rym: There are games that don't support it out of the box, and Steam actually has a big disclaimer about that in the fact, but that's because those are games that, like, have an external account, and it's a matter of, those games never supported it from day one.

280
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:33,468
Scott: You knew when you were buying the game that it wasn't supported.

281
00:26:33,528 --> 00:26:38,400
Scott: This is, you bought it, assuming this support was there, and now it's gone.

282
00:26:38,821 --> 00:26:50,920
Scott: They should at least, right, Steam should at least let you refund the game, because then in situations like the one I just described, the parent could refund it and use the money to buy the copy for the kid who plays it the most.

283
00:26:51,700 --> 00:27:00,660
Rym: Now, as of when I got this article together earlier today for the GeekNights episode, the company has made zero statement, and they did this without announcing anything.

284
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,493
Scott: There's no- And this is obviously a popular game.

285
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:06,659
Rym: I don't play it, but it's called- It is one of the most popular games on Steam right now.

286
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:07,877
Scott: Indeed.

287
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:09,240
Rym: Under, like, Counter-Strike.

288
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:19,300
Scott: Yeah, maybe their data was telling them that, like, there were kids who were, like, buying one copy and then, you know, familying, you know- But they can't play at the same time, so it wouldn't include those numbers.

289
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,066
Scott: Yeah, with all their friends.

290
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:22,000
Scott: Exactly, exactly.

291
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:32,558
Scott: Like, I don't understand that- They're just, someone was just like, you know, probably some corporate dude was like, "Eh," and all the developers were like, "Eh," and then they had to do it.

292
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,999
Rym: I mean, case in point, it's like a micro version of what's happening over at Twitter right now.

293
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,843
Scott: Yeah, basically.

294
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:43,380
Scott: So, even though I don't play Call of Duty and I don't like that game, it's a bullshit.

295
00:27:43,801 --> 00:27:44,440
Scott: It's a bullshit.

296
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,620
Scott: I support you Call of Duty people in calling out this bullshit, especially if you were using it, so.

297
00:27:51,124 --> 00:27:51,419
Rym: Alright.

298
00:27:51,881 --> 00:27:54,777
Scott: I think Steam should be like, "Hey, if you don't support family, you can't be on

299
00:27:54,797 --> 00:27:54,998
Scott: Steam.".

300
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:55,581
Scott: Yeah.

301
00:27:56,184 --> 00:27:59,839
Rym: Or you got, we take twice that double cut if you don't support it.

302
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,677
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

303
00:28:09,717 --> 00:28:10,160
Rym: What do you got?

304
00:28:11,502 --> 00:28:13,080
Scott: What did I have as thing of the day?

305
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,239
Rym: The CSS Pokemon thing.

306
00:28:14,962 --> 00:28:15,515
Scott: Oh, right, so.

307
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,480
Rym: It's pretty cool, I ended up on the stream.

308
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,662
Scott: It is really cool, yeah.

309
00:28:18,722 --> 00:28:31,500
Scott: So, if you want to play a card game on the internet with other people, right, you gotta get, you know, there aren't really that many good, you know, implementations of that, except for, I guess, one we'll talk about today, our main bit.

310
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:39,100
Scott: And, you know, games like Magic, the Magic Online, Hearthstone, obviously, right, a few others, there aren't many.

311
00:28:40,123 --> 00:28:42,220
Scott: It would be really nice if you could do it in the web browser.

312
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,740
Scott: The problem is, is that making a good UI for a card game in the browser is tough.

313
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:54,960
Scott: You know, even if you could make the UI good, it's not going to look fancy, like, look at the animations in Hearthstone, right?

314
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:02,620
Scott: It's like, I stopped playing that game years ago, but it's like, you kind of need, it's like, they're not important for someone like me who just cares about the game.

315
00:29:03,101 --> 00:29:16,940
Scott: But it's like, you kind of need that to make a successful multiplayer online card game, right, to have it look good and fancy and all that biz, right, with the animations and the sound effects, because just cards, you know, it's tough, right?

316
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,478
Scott: It's like, maybe you could be successful, but I don't know.

317
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:31,060
Scott: So, it's like, well, if you're just in the web browser with, you know, where you don't really have much to work with, right, you don't have like a game, you know, fancy game engine going on, how are you going to make the cards look good?

318
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:58,440
Scott: Well, here we have a obviously copyright infringing tech demo of a web development technique where they used CSS, some 3D transforms, some filters and some other techniques to be, it's not a whole game, but they're just made, you know, interactive in web browser cards that spin, move, light up.

319
00:29:59,002 --> 00:30:02,660
Scott: They're like, it's like, they look fantastic.

320
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,568
Scott: These look better than any cards in any actual game engine card game.

321
00:30:08,828 --> 00:30:15,559
Scott: Like these are the best looking cards like to play with that are digital I have ever seen ever.

322
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,894
Scott: And it's like, just copy this person's code and make an in web browser card game.

323
00:30:21,974 --> 00:30:23,980
Scott: Obviously you can't make the Pokemon one to get in trouble.

324
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:28,892
Scott: But it's like, this is, you got your, all this work is just already done for you.

325
00:30:29,153 --> 00:30:32,710
Scott: All you got to do is the rest, which is the other 90%.

326
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,359
Rym: This is amazing.

327
00:30:34,421 --> 00:30:36,785
Scott: This is incredible, incredible work here.

328
00:30:36,805 --> 00:30:44,440
Scott: I can't, you know, somebody's going to someday in my life will make a card game where the, you know, digital card game where the cards are like this.

329
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:49,046
Scott: Maybe it'll be me, but the source code is just fucking right there.

330
00:30:49,126 --> 00:30:52,211
Scott: GitHub, boom, GitHub, Pokemon cards, CSS.

331
00:30:52,272 --> 00:30:52,873
Scott: There it is.

332
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:55,237
Scott: It's like, holy shit.

333
00:30:56,419 --> 00:30:57,080
Scott: Let's make it happen.

334
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:57,600
Rym: Yeah.

335
00:30:58,142 --> 00:31:01,473
Rym: So I got a little thing, but you may be familiar with an old game, Zoo Tycoon.

336
00:31:01,854 --> 00:31:03,500
Rym: It was a popular game a long time ago.

337
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:08,040
Scott: It was in the same series, you know, with the railroad tycoon and the roller coaster tycoon and all those.

338
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,301
Scott: Yup.

339
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:11,928
Rym: This is a game from 2001.

340
00:31:11,928 --> 00:31:15,456
Rym: Like I was, God, that actually was a long time ago yet.

341
00:31:15,697 --> 00:31:17,180
Rym: We were already in college, so.

342
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,381
Scott: Yup.

343
00:31:18,721 --> 00:31:19,403
Scott: I never played it.

344
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,929
Scott: I played like the first roller coaster tycoon a little bit.

345
00:31:21,989 --> 00:31:26,380
Scott: I guarded the first one, so I never bought or played any of them for an extended period.

346
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:40,360
Rym: So this video is a short video, but it, it experiments with the game and determines the full details of a very specific behavior in the game when guests fall into or otherwise are in water.

347
00:31:41,841 --> 00:31:46,732
Rym: And what they determined is that you can only drown men in Zoo Tycoon.

348
00:31:47,052 --> 00:31:49,557
Rym: The people in the park are men, women or children.

349
00:31:49,578 --> 00:31:50,700
Rym: They have three like models.

350
00:31:52,262 --> 00:31:53,788
Rym: Let's not get into gender stuff around there.

351
00:31:53,808 --> 00:31:55,836
Rym: This is an old game from 2001, so it is what it is.

352
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:07,560
Rym: But if you set up implausible scenarios to trap someone in water, men will drown, women and children will be teleported to safety.

353
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:15,580
Rym: Someone specifically designed this game to ensure that women and children cannot die no matter what you do, but men are fair game.

354
00:32:16,481 --> 00:32:17,687
Rym: It's not clear why.

355
00:32:17,867 --> 00:32:20,660
Rym: There is no game difference between those three kinds of players.

356
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,584
Scott: Okay, so I did some research here.

357
00:32:23,804 --> 00:32:31,340
Scott: This game was made by Blue Fang Games, which was basically owned by Microsoft and then closed down when their Microsoft deal ended.

358
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,349
Scott: They were in Massachusetts, right?

359
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:34,354
Scott: They were founded in '98.

360
00:32:34,555 --> 00:32:36,481
Scott: They closed in 2011.

361
00:32:36,481 --> 00:32:40,040
Scott: Actually, they're not related to Roller Coaster Tycoon or Railroad Tycoon.

362
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,342
Rym: Really?

363
00:32:40,382 --> 00:32:41,409
Rym: Because they look like identical graphics.

364
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:48,500
Scott: They're the same genre, yeah, but the games that were made by this studio were Zoo Tycoon, right?

365
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,131
Scott: I think these are expansions for Zoo Tycoon.

366
00:32:53,332 --> 00:32:55,460
Scott: Zoo Tycoon 2, a bunch of expansions.

367
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,003
Scott: Zoo Tycoon DS.

368
00:32:57,484 --> 00:32:59,208
Scott: Zoo Tycoon 2 DS.

369
00:32:59,829 --> 00:33:02,576
Scott: World of Zoo in 2009 for Windows DS and Wii.

370
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,868
Scott: A game in 2009 called Lion Pride for iOS.

371
00:33:08,651 --> 00:33:11,840
Scott: A game in 2010 for iOS called Lion Pride Huge.

372
00:33:12,602 --> 00:33:13,726
Scott: Another 2010 game for Facebook.

373
00:33:13,767 --> 00:33:17,018
Rym: That feels like a downward spiral into shitware.

374
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:17,580
Rym: I don't know.

375
00:33:18,421 --> 00:33:20,828
Scott: A 2010 Facebook game called Zoo Kingdom.

376
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:25,120
Scott: A 2011 implementation of Carmen Sandiego for Facebook.

377
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,116
Scott: And a 2011 implementation of Oregon Trail for Facebook.

378
00:33:29,156 --> 00:33:29,920
Scott: And then they were done.

379
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:40,760
Scott: So the only games they really made that were successful or notable, but were indeed popular, successful, notable, and award-winning were Zoo Tycoon, Zoo Tycoon 2, etc.

380
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:45,020
Rym: Really feels like the kind of game I would get a demo of in PC Gamer.

381
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:55,920
Rym: But what's fascinating is in exploring this in the video, what we find is that the game has surprisingly complex drowning mechanics.

382
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:04,100
Rym: Which makes the fact that they decided to prevent women and children from drowning with an additional separate mechanic all the more fascinating.

383
00:34:04,681 --> 00:34:14,600
Rym: A drowning male will only be able to see six tiles in the distance and will swim randomly until they see land or a safe place to get to and then try to get to it.

384
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,648
Rym: And they have a stamina that will run out and eventually they'll just die.

385
00:34:18,049 --> 00:34:21,800
Rym: Women will just teleport somewhere on the map where they'll be safe.

386
00:34:23,042 --> 00:34:27,199
Scott: If you want some more advanced drowning, I would suggest Dwarf Fortress.

387
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,179
Scott: Which is perhaps the most drowning-est game to ever be.

388
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,340
Rym: In the metamoment, the Geegneis Book Club book apparently is still binty 'cause Sonic Segment didn't update the website yet.

389
00:34:41,724 --> 00:34:43,759
Scott: I had a reminder to do it, but then I didn't do it.

390
00:34:44,681 --> 00:34:49,800
Rym: I only make fun of you because I have forgotten to do it every time for at least a couple weeks before I finally do it.

391
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:52,119
Scott: We're putting it on the list right now.

392
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:52,681
Rym: Yep.

393
00:34:52,741 --> 00:34:54,507
Rym: But the Geegneis Book Club was binty.

394
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:55,391
Rym: Just read it.

395
00:34:55,713 --> 00:34:56,536
Rym: It's fantastic.

396
00:34:56,576 --> 00:34:57,440
Rym: We did the show on it.

397
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,926
Rym: The new book has been announced.

398
00:34:59,207 --> 00:35:00,051
Rym: It looks really great.

399
00:35:00,151 --> 00:35:00,734
Rym: I already bought it.

400
00:35:00,814 --> 00:35:02,100
Rym: I'm gonna start reading it this weekend.

401
00:35:03,248 --> 00:35:03,372
Scott: Mhm.

402
00:35:05,461 --> 00:35:15,059
Rym: We will be, or either I will be or me and Scott will be at PAX Unplugged on Sunday giving a panel called "Why is this game taking 4

403
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:15,299
Rym: hours?"

404
00:35:15,941 --> 00:35:19,960
Rym: Which is a somewhat updated version of our "Take your fucking turn" panel.

405
00:35:20,821 --> 00:35:25,420
Rym: But nuance changed a little bit, removing some old examples, adding some new examples, etc.

406
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,086
Rym: But we'll be there.

407
00:35:27,528 --> 00:35:28,673
Rym: We'll only be there on Sunday.

408
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:30,140
Rym: Don't expect us to be there any other days.

409
00:35:31,021 --> 00:35:36,940
Rym: We'll see what happens in regard to COVID and other PAXes and what the future holds for us doing live performances.

410
00:35:38,702 --> 00:35:41,980
Rym: I pretty much stopped using Twitter, so you're gonna keep seeing updates from me.

411
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:45,797
Rym: Like, I'm not quitting Twitter in a big huff, but I'm just not going to it anymore, so...

412
00:35:46,461 --> 00:35:49,880
Scott: Yeah, we'll probably talk about this on the next Monday episode, right?

413
00:35:50,480 --> 00:36:08,900
Scott: But, you know, we've always, Geegneis has been following it pretty strictly, but personally I haven't, despite believing in it, I haven't followed it the most strictly throughout my life, but there's a model called the Posse Model, which is where you publish your work on your own site, POS, and then you syndicate it elsewhere.

414
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:18,486
Scott: So you treat other platforms like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube as just places to basically copy your shit to, to get it out there so people can find it.

415
00:36:18,867 --> 00:36:23,540
Scott: But your official location for any of your own work is your own website.

416
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:33,840
Scott: You publish everything yourself, and then when you post on other websites, you're either posting copies, and you're hopefully including links back to your own site, and you just do that for everything.

417
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:41,520
Scott: And then if people only want to use those other sites, okay, they can still see whatever content you choose to send over there.

418
00:36:42,341 --> 00:36:48,900
Scott: And if they don't want to come to your site, okay, they don't have to, but they can, and you'll never lose your shit, right?

419
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:55,060
Scott: I've seen so many sites, you know, platforms from GeoCities onward disappear over the years.

420
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:06,680
Scott: If you do, if you do things this way, you can never get burned, because your stuff will always be where it was in its true original location, as long as you can keep it up.

421
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:12,539
Scott: So I'm going to move to that model more strictly for the remaining years of my life.

422
00:37:15,082 --> 00:37:20,980
Rym: We have both been through this rodeo of a platform becoming the most important platform in the world and then disappearing.

423
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,452
Scott: It's happened so many times.

424
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:40,679
Scott: Right, it's my last rodeo for this, so I'm just going to transfer to basically having everything on my own shit, and if another site comes up and I happen to syndicate to it, it's like, okay, and if that site dies, okay, it's just a place I'm syndicating to, what do I care, right, you know?

425
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:51,920
Scott: Whereas now, it's like I unwisely invested in some platforms, you know, and then they die, and it's like, well, I learned my lesson, that's enough of that.

426
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,640
Rym: Downloaded my 6.5 gigabytes of Twitter archive.

427
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,480
Scott: Oh, I mean, I've been downloading it monthly for quite some time.

428
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,000
Rym: I was doing it like biannually, because I wasn't that fussed, because I had most of the archive, but I got one last.

429
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:10,020
Scott: I mean, yeah, I have like reminders set to back up things to my NAS that I can't do automatically.

430
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:17,040
Rym: Yup, so I say that because you're going to keep seeing like GeekNights announcements happen for my Twitter, but like don't add me.

431
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:26,100
Scott: Yeah, we're going to continue, don't, you know, whatever, you know, you have to decide on your own listener, which web platforms, which internet services you're going to use, that's up to you.

432
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:32,140
Rym: And like to be clear, I'm not making a moral stand, I'm not quitting Twitter in a like, we should all quit it for more reasons.

433
00:38:32,581 --> 00:38:34,240
Rym: I just don't like using Twitter anymore.

434
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:41,940
Scott: I have opinions on which platforms I like and don't like, but I'm not going to try to, you know, tell other people what they should or should not do.

435
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:48,640
Scott: I might, you know, air my opinions, but it's like, you know, you do what you got to do, and I'll meet you where you are, right?

436
00:38:49,642 --> 00:38:55,300
Scott: If that's the thing you want to use, I'll post links, you know, so you can get notified the way you want to get notified.

437
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,010
Scott: It doesn't really hurt me, it doesn't help those platforms.

438
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:00,118
Scott: that much, you know, big deal.

439
00:39:01,161 --> 00:39:03,425
Scott: As long as it's easy enough to do, what do I care?

440
00:39:03,445 --> 00:39:09,936
Scott: I'll meet you where you are at, but I'm not going to participate in the other places, right?

441
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,740
Scott: It's like the time for that is pretty much over.

442
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:19,780
Rym: I feel like I will still post to Reddit occasionally, but that's sort of a different type of use case.

443
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,111
Rym: I don't generate content to Reddit.

444
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:23,740
Rym: I just write comments on Reddit.

445
00:39:24,701 --> 00:39:26,940
Scott: Well, we'll talk about it more on the Monday.

446
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:33,875
Rym: But yeah, don't at me on Twitter, and if Twitter is the only way you know to reach me, DM me.

447
00:39:33,975 --> 00:39:35,138
Rym: I'm keeping my DMs open.

448
00:39:35,338 --> 00:39:36,280
Rym: I do get the DMs.

449
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,517
Scott: You can always email.

450
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,484
Rym: Yeah, email works, guys.

451
00:39:40,608 --> 00:39:41,651
Rym: Email still exists.

452
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:44,500
Rym: Our email address is real easy to figure out.

453
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,795
Rym: And I am going to make a concerted, because I'm not looking at Twitter anymore, I'm going to replace at least some of that time.

454
00:39:52,835 --> 00:39:58,060
Rym: I would spend wasting my life on Twitter, looking at the GeekNights forum more than I have.

455
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,820
Scott: Wasting your time on your own shit instead of wasting your time on someone else's shit.

456
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,280
Rym: I mean, if you're going to waste time, you're better off smelling your own farts than smelling someone else's farts.

457
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,040
Rym: If farts are what you're after.

458
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,960
Scott: In the attention economy, if you got attention and you're going to burn it, might as well burn it in your own stove, keeping yourself warm.

459
00:40:17,601 --> 00:40:21,610
Rym: So, Marvel Snap is an online digital game.

460
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,514
Rym: It came out this month.

461
00:40:24,276 --> 00:40:26,000
Rym: It's on, I guess, computers.

462
00:40:27,062 --> 00:40:27,747
Rym: Well, not everything.

463
00:40:27,767 --> 00:40:29,720
Rym: It's not on the Switch, even though I think it would be great on the Switch.

464
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,600
Scott: Oh, I thought it was on the Switch.

465
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,820
Rym: No, it's only on Android, iOS, and Windows.

466
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:33,820
Scott: Okay.

467
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,023
Rym: Yeah, nothing else.

468
00:40:35,344 --> 00:40:40,500
Rym: That's most things, but I feel like they're leaving money on the table by not having a Switch port.

469
00:40:41,423 --> 00:40:47,620
Scott: So, a lot of the premier developers who worked on Hearthstone at Blizzard, they left long ago.

470
00:40:48,221 --> 00:40:50,620
Scott: I think we must have talked about it when it happened.

471
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:59,400
Scott: And they went to create a new studio called Second Dinner, which is a joke I presume is related to the second breakfast that hobbits eat.

472
00:41:01,301 --> 00:41:06,940
Scott: And they were working on something, and we assumed it had to be card game-ish because they were all Hearthstone devs.

473
00:41:07,362 --> 00:41:10,960
Scott: And we knew that there was some news that came out that they had a Marvel license.

474
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:17,600
Scott: But not until, literally, they did the Apple approach, right?

475
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,300
Scott: Basically, they fucking announced the thing and released it pretty much on top of each other.

476
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,646
Scott: Like, here it is, right?

477
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:26,299
Scott: They weren't like, Marvel Snap coming next year, right?

478
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,955
Scott: They're like, Marvel Snap, fucking here it is, bitches.

479
00:41:29,075 --> 00:41:29,820
Scott: It's out, right?

480
00:41:30,843 --> 00:41:34,800
Rym: I believe there was a brief early access period on Steam in Windows.

481
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:39,060
Scott: Yeah, there were some beta early access type periods of some kind.

482
00:41:39,661 --> 00:41:47,860
Scott: But it's like, it pretty much, you know, unless you were deep into it with them, it's like, you know, the majority of people didn't know about it until, here it is.

483
00:41:48,441 --> 00:41:48,541
Rym: Yup.

484
00:41:48,561 --> 00:41:52,800
Rym: So I think we should, let's talk about the game itself first, because that's a more interesting conversation.

485
00:41:53,101 --> 00:41:59,140
Rym: Before we talk about the monetization and the problems with the ecosystem around it.

486
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:05,020
Rym: Because I gotta say, like, TL;DL, the game itself is a really solid, well-designed game.

487
00:42:05,701 --> 00:42:08,360
Scott: Well, they stole from the Forgotten Masters, right?

488
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:14,600
Scott: You might go back into the GeekNights archives and find an episode we did about Rainer Knizia's battle line, right?

489
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,120
Scott: Which is also known as, what, Shot N' Totten?

490
00:42:17,741 --> 00:42:19,920
Rym: Yeah, Shot N' Totten came first, I want to say.

491
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:29,740
Scott: Yeah, right, but basically, there are several games that are, that I guess originated with Knizia, that are very similar in mechanics, right?

492
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,400
Scott: There's also the Warhammer LCG, which, I forget what that one's called.

493
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:34,665
Rym: Yeah.

494
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:41,080
Scott: The Warhammer LCG, was it the, I think it's the Invasion one, if I'm not mistaken.

495
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:44,420
Rym: But these games all follow a pattern.

496
00:42:44,921 --> 00:42:50,860
Scott: Yes, Warhammer Invasion is also in the same kind of, you know, realm of game.

497
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:56,520
Rym: The pattern is basically, there'll be some number of zones of some kind lined up in a row.

498
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:04,340
Rym: And you take turns playing cards that have various amounts of power in some capacity into those zones.

499
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,160
Rym: And the zones have some sort of limit on how many things can be in the zone, usually.

500
00:43:09,002 --> 00:43:25,060
Rym: And there are some conditions where you win or lose a zone, and whoever controls the most zones, or maybe some variations on that theme, like battle line has some additional ways to win, like controlling three zones that are next to each other, you win the game.

501
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,047
Scott: Yeah, it's a lot like, you know, a Colonel Blotto, right?

502
00:43:29,167 --> 00:43:35,160
Scott: Only, there's no, like, you know, the adjacencies are much simpler because you don't have a map, right?

503
00:43:35,283 --> 00:43:35,519
Scott: Yep.

504
00:43:35,941 --> 00:43:41,435
Scott: And, you know, there'll be like less options, and every single location is worth the same amount, right?

505
00:43:41,455 --> 00:43:43,300
Scott: They're all worth one location, right?

506
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:53,680
Scott: Whereas like El Grande, the different locations, like when you hold them, how long you hold them, you know, it's like, you go from El Grande, you simplify and make it, you know, linear, and that's battle line.

507
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:59,680
Scott: And you make it even simpler, and you only have three locations total, and it's just two out of three, that's Marvel Snap.

508
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:05,700
Scott: Marvel Snap is like the baby's firstest battle line Colonel Blotto, like that you can get.

509
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:20,580
Scott: It's like as easy and as simple as you can make it while still having it be a game, but even though it's such a, like, it's like they removed so much, but the game is guaranteed to be six turns.

510
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,920
Scott: There's, I think, a rare occasion.

511
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,200
Rym: Well, it can be four turns.

512
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:24,719
Rym: It can also be four turns.

513
00:44:25,563 --> 00:44:27,048
Scott: It's also rare occasions.

514
00:44:27,108 --> 00:44:30,240
Scott: only four turns, yes, but most of the time it's six turns.

515
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,620
Scott: It takes less than a minute, basically.

516
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:37,420
Rym: A whole match, even if the other player takes forever to take their turn.

517
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,800
Rym: We're talking 90 seconds, start to finish, game's over.

518
00:44:41,901 --> 00:44:46,400
Rym: So total aside, I pulled up battle line just to like bring up a screen for the listener on the stream.

519
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:53,880
Rym: Someone made their own version of battle line, and it's all Simpsons characters, and it is like top tier.

520
00:44:54,222 --> 00:44:56,859
Rym: This is way too high quality what this person did.

521
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,579
Scott: Of course, right?

522
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:09,160
Scott: So Marvel Snap is basically, all right, look, you're not going to get the rich, you know, in-depth complex version that you get with El Grande or battle line where you get, you know, sit there for a little while.

523
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:13,260
Scott: But you're going to be able to get like that game mechanic.

524
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:16,840
Scott: Like you're going to exercise, you know, like flex that muscle like three times.

525
00:45:17,022 --> 00:45:17,716
Scott: Like one, two, three.

526
00:45:18,023 --> 00:45:18,213
Scott: Right.

527
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,760
Scott: And it's not, it's like you'll get some amount of juice for that fruit.

528
00:45:22,229 --> 00:45:22,440
Scott: Right.

529
00:45:22,806 --> 00:45:23,760
Scott: It's not like you're getting nothing.

530
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,100
Scott: It's like you're getting a little bit of game, game juice.

531
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:26,897
Scott: Right.

532
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,840
Scott: And it takes so little time.

533
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:29,758
Scott: It's like, you know what?

534
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,600
Scott: Time invested versus game juice received.

535
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:42,440
Scott: It's like if you sit there and play Marvel Snap for an hour or play El Grande once, you might get more juice out of the Marvel Snap just because there's so many iterations.

536
00:45:42,621 --> 00:45:44,600
Rym: In fact, this ties into that one El Grande.

537
00:45:44,822 --> 00:45:46,819
Rym: Remember our take your fucking turn title where we are.

538
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:54,140
Rym: Our core argument was that a very short game that's pretty good is probably better by most measures than a very long game.

539
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,017
Rym: That's very good.

540
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,095
Scott: Yeah.

541
00:45:56,781 --> 00:46:01,299
Scott: So in Marvel Snap, you basically construct a small deck of cards, very small.

542
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:01,740
Scott: Right.

543
00:46:02,443 --> 00:46:04,260
Rym: And there can only be drawn of any card.

544
00:46:04,421 --> 00:46:08,760
Rym: So you can't have like, you can't have ten to Spider-Man and have to Spider-Man.

545
00:46:08,902 --> 00:46:09,060
Scott: Right.

546
00:46:09,545 --> 00:46:10,420
Scott: Each card is unique.

547
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,019
Scott: So it's a completely every one of each.

548
00:46:13,332 --> 00:46:13,480
Scott: Right.

549
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:13,815
Scott: That's it.

550
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,260
Scott: And they're all Marvel superheroes.

551
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:21,120
Scott: And, you know, while there's a collecting aspect to the game, and usually I hate that shit.

552
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:24,840
Scott: I'm someone who grew up collecting superhero cards mostly.

553
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,760
Rym: So we collected mostly the same cards.

554
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:34,080
Rym: And these art, the art on these cards evokes the exact art on the fucking cards I collected as a kid.

555
00:46:34,641 --> 00:46:36,300
Scott: They're really nice fucking cards.

556
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:38,340
Scott: I really like superhero cards.

557
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,460
Rym: I feel like I can smell the cards when I'm playing Marvel Snap.

558
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:41,600
Rym: Yeah.

559
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,459
Rym: Part of my brain says you should be able to smell these.

560
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,400
Scott: They're real nice cards.

561
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,540
Scott: So on your turn, you basically take simultaneous turns, which is, we love that.

562
00:46:50,727 --> 00:46:50,880
Scott: Right.

563
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,420
Scott: No waiting.

564
00:46:51,501 --> 00:46:51,711
Scott: Right.

565
00:46:52,922 --> 00:46:56,980
Scott: And you on your turn, you can play a card to one of the three locations.

566
00:46:57,482 --> 00:47:00,140
Scott: Every superhero has a value of how strong they are.

567
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,519
Rym: You can play any number of cards.

568
00:47:02,562 --> 00:47:03,039
Scott: That's true.

569
00:47:03,581 --> 00:47:05,532
Scott: But you have mana.

570
00:47:05,632 --> 00:47:06,940
Scott: basically that scales up.

571
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:07,137
Scott: Right.

572
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,040
Scott: So in turn one, you can play one mana worth of cards.

573
00:47:10,181 --> 00:47:12,360
Scott: And on turn two, you can play two mana worth of cards.

574
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:16,460
Rym: That has been the pattern for a while now for these kinds of games across the board.

575
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,619
Rym: The just linear mana ramp up.

576
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:23,080
Scott: And have you seen any mechanics that let anyone cheat that system?

577
00:47:23,524 --> 00:47:23,960
Rym: Not one.

578
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,040
Rym: The only mechanics I've seen that interact with that at all.

579
00:47:27,321 --> 00:47:32,100
Rym: There are some locations that will give both players a bunch of extra mana one round.

580
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:33,100
Scott: Which sure.

581
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:33,374
Scott: Yup.

582
00:47:33,902 --> 00:47:35,140
Rym: And there is one location.

583
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,219
Scott: As long as it's even, that's fair.

584
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,300
Rym: There's one location.

585
00:47:37,902 --> 00:47:42,880
Rym: If you have no cards in that location, you get one extra mana every turn.

586
00:47:44,421 --> 00:47:47,120
Scott: There's also a location that we'll discuss because it's hilarious.

587
00:47:48,382 --> 00:47:52,880
Scott: Both players at random, right, have one card from their hand.

588
00:47:53,301 --> 00:47:55,520
Scott: Just come and get played at that location for free.

589
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,859
Scott: You have no control over it.

590
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,959
Rym: There's a worse one.

591
00:47:58,241 --> 00:48:00,960
Rym: You both get a card put in your hand without your control.

592
00:48:01,361 --> 00:48:08,120
Rym: And there's another card, Agatha Harkness, which if that card is in your hand, the mechanic is, the AI plays your entire turn.

593
00:48:08,181 --> 00:48:08,900
Rym: You can't play the game.

594
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,759
Rym: The AI plays for you the entire match.

595
00:48:12,202 --> 00:48:13,669
Scott: Does ego the living planet?

596
00:48:13,709 --> 00:48:15,196
Scott: who plays for you, right?

597
00:48:17,921 --> 00:48:19,560
Scott: But yeah, there's all kinds of wacky stuff.

598
00:48:20,403 --> 00:48:22,400
Scott: They obviously borrowed a lot from hearthstone.

599
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:28,560
Rym: These cards range from Cyclops, he's just a strong guy, to card that makes an AI play for you like we just described.

600
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,459
Rym: They're all over the place.

601
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,760
Scott: But anyway, you play cards at the locations, right?

602
00:48:33,001 --> 00:48:37,680
Scott: And then whoever has more total power at a location is the winner of that location.

603
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:42,680
Scott: Whoever wins two out of the three locations is the winner of the entire game.

604
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,200
Scott: That's that, right?

605
00:48:44,361 --> 00:48:48,560
Rym: If there is a tie, because ties are pretty common, actually.

606
00:48:49,501 --> 00:48:51,600
Scott: I didn't experience any, but I didn't play that long.

607
00:48:51,901 --> 00:48:54,400
Rym: I played until I got to near gold rank.

608
00:48:54,621 --> 00:48:55,978
Rym: I played it a lot, just to really...

609
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,755
Scott: I played until I lost a game, which was both longer and shorter.

610
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:09,640
Rym: So if there is a tie, because you could be tied on one or more locations, like that could happen easily.

611
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:14,985
Rym: Because there are locations where the location power is like, "Cards can't be played here.

612
00:49:15,969 --> 00:49:17,255
Rym: Any card played here is immediately

613
00:49:17,296 --> 00:49:17,697
Rym: destroyed.".

614
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,680
Scott: But there are other guys like Nightcrawler who you can play and then move after you play them.

615
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:28,180
Scott: So that's how you can get power at a location, even though you can't play anyone directly to the location.

616
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:36,480
Rym: But if there is a tie, the power differential among the total power on your side versus the total power on their side is the tiebreaker.

617
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:40,060
Rym: I do not know what the tiebreaker is if that is also tied.

618
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:41,440
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

619
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,259
Rym: The fact didn't say it last I checked either.

620
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:46,540
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of unspoken rules, right?

621
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,760
Scott: Because it's such a straightforward game.

622
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:53,400
Scott: Hearthstone made the same mistake because they didn't provide a complete rulebook, right?

623
00:49:53,881 --> 00:50:02,180
Scott: So the only way to know weird situations is to do science, encounter those situations, and see what the code does.

624
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:05,540
Rym: What I can say, though, is this game does something that's rare.

625
00:50:06,221 --> 00:50:07,939
Rym: It does the Glory to Rome thing.

626
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:18,360
Rym: Pretty much every time I've seen an interaction, and I feel like if that plays out the way it logically should, it's going to be really, really ridiculous.

627
00:50:18,781 --> 00:50:20,239
Rym: And the ridiculous thing just happens.

628
00:50:20,582 --> 00:50:23,060
Rym: You got eight hulks out there out of nowhere suddenly.

629
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:25,449
Rym: The crazy thing seems to happen.

630
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:27,640
Rym: if the crazy thing seems like it makes sense to happen.

631
00:50:27,981 --> 00:50:28,339
Scott: Of course.

632
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:33,100
Rym: And the cool part is, in a more serious game that takes longer, that would suck.

633
00:50:33,601 --> 00:50:35,010
Rym: Like, "Oh, the weird thing happened.

634
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:35,613
Rym: The game just went

635
00:50:35,714 --> 00:50:36,136
Rym: crazy.".

636
00:50:36,921 --> 00:50:41,740
Scott: Yeah, the guy has eight hulks on turn three, and now you have to play the rest of the game for another half hour.

637
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,840
Rym: Yeah, no, this game takes 90 seconds.

638
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:46,480
Rym: Right, so someone hits a bunch of hulks.

639
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,215
Scott: It's like, "Alright, I lost that one.

640
00:50:48,255 --> 00:50:48,538
Scott: Next.".

641
00:50:48,841 --> 00:50:50,079
Rym: And there's a resign button.

642
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:57,539
Rym: And this is where the game gets brilliant, because this game did something I never expected, a game that is clearly aimed at children, to do.

643
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,900
Rym: It has a backgammon-esque doubling cube.

644
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:28,880
Scott: Yup, so the backgammon-esque doubling cube takes a game that would otherwise be a very baby's first child's baby version of a game, and adds a significant strategic element that raises the skill cap somewhat significantly, and makes play actually interesting for advanced players without really hurting it for weaker players.

645
00:51:29,821 --> 00:51:37,639
Scott: It's like, you know, if you're good at the doubling cube, then obviously when you win, you'll win more, and when you lose, you'll lose less.

646
00:51:38,041 --> 00:51:51,440
Scott: But it doesn't matter, because let's say you're low skill, and you don't play the doubling cube properly, okay, and when you win, you'll still win, and when you lose, you still lose, but you'll just win less and lose more.

647
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,550
Scott: But it's like, who wins and loses doesn't change.

648
00:51:54,891 --> 00:51:57,000
Scott: Just how much is won and lost changes.

649
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,939
Scott: So, not a big deal.

650
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,049
Rym: What is this, how much?

651
00:52:00,171 --> 00:52:01,040
Rym: What are we wagering?

652
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:12,037
Rym: It's basically, there's like a million currencies in this game, we'll get to that part of this in a second, but there is cubes, and the cubes are how you advance through the actual ranks.

653
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:21,380
Rym: Like, higher cubes mean you're match made with other players who also have higher cubes, and that's kind of the progression system through the game.

654
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,540
Scott: And the snap is an allusion to the Infinity Gauntlet.

655
00:52:25,022 --> 00:52:26,140
Rym: Yup, if you didn't pick up on that.

656
00:52:26,942 --> 00:52:28,891
Scott: The Marvel theme is very strong.

657
00:52:29,835 --> 00:52:30,899
Scott: They just went all in on it.

658
00:52:34,622 --> 00:52:40,720
Rym: Yup, so, oh my god, I just played a game on my phone, and I literally got harkness, and it's playing for me, and now I can't play.

659
00:52:41,161 --> 00:52:41,951
Rym: So, so much for that.

660
00:52:42,398 --> 00:52:42,539
Scott: Anyway.

661
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:43,444
Scott: I uninstalled it.

662
00:52:44,188 --> 00:52:46,480
Scott: I actually never had it on my phone, I only played it on Steam.

663
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:54,940
Rym: The way the doubling cube works in this game, the snap, is you play the game normally, and at the end of the game, whoever wins gets some cubes, whoever loses loses some cubes.

664
00:52:55,522 --> 00:53:00,520
Rym: At any time, either player can click the snap, and it does a big graphical, like, snap.

665
00:53:01,641 --> 00:53:05,500
Rym: It basically doubles the stakes of how many cubes are going to be won or lost.

666
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:19,340
Rym: When someone snaps, your options are either continue playing, and the elevated stakes take effect starting the next round, or resign, just quit, just give up, cut your losses, and you only lose that initial cube.

667
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,060
Rym: You don't, like, the doubling doesn't actually happen.

668
00:53:22,705 --> 00:53:24,620
Rym: So, you can snap, and the other person just quits.

669
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:37,640
Rym: Once you've snapped, you can't snap again, the other player, just like in backgammon, at any time if they want, they can snap, and double the stakes again, and you'll either have to accept that, or quit yourself.

670
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:59,259
Scott: That's basically identical to what the backgammon doubling cube does, and pretty much, we can have a strategic discussion about how it, you know, adds bluffing mechanics to the game, and how it adds, you know, it rewards people with good positional heuristics, like, if you know you're winning, right, then it's, it rewards, it gives you a reward, because now you know you're, you know, you can, not only can you...

671
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:07,220
Rym: Doubling cubes are an advanced game mechanic that are, that is, I would say it is one of the most interesting and powerful core game mechanics there is.

672
00:54:07,741 --> 00:54:08,257
Rym: Like, it's up there.

673
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:17,200
Scott: Yeah, it's really, it's really simple, but it adds a whole lot to a game for players to think about, and they threw it in there, and there you go.

674
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,020
Scott: Good, great, genius, perfect idea, amazing.

675
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:25,680
Rym: I have won many matches, because I bluffed and snapped in the last round when I had bupkis in my hand.

676
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:27,739
Scott: Yup, bluffing works.

677
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,000
Rym: And the locations are great too, like, the locations...

678
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,699
Scott: You can't bluff and backgammon though, because it's not like someone, you can't prove that you're gonna get, know that you're gonna get to roll sixes, right?

679
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:41,760
Rym: Backgammon is just knowing, backgammon the cube really just tests, do you know basic statistics?

680
00:54:42,804 --> 00:54:42,996
Scott: Yeah.

681
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,080
Rym: Of lots of rolls of 26.

682
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,200
Scott: Or, are you, are you cheating?

683
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,138
Rym: Yeah, are you cheating is a big part too.

684
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:51,480
Scott: But, uh... Are you, or are you a risk taker, I don't know.

685
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:52,379
Rym: So here's the problem.

686
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:56,940
Rym: Everything about the game itself is actually pretty great.

687
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,000
Rym: Like, there is, I have zero complaints about this game.

688
00:55:00,101 --> 00:55:00,439
Rym: In fact...

689
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:08,960
Scott: Well, okay, the complaint I would have about the game, right, is that, you know, when I, I basically, I played it, and I played it until I lost.

690
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:17,540
Scott: And the one match I lost, right, we'll tell the funny story, right, a location appeared, well first, a location appeared that said everyone gets rocks in their hand.

691
00:55:18,003 --> 00:55:20,800
Scott: And the rock is basically just a, it's a rock, literally a rock.

692
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:28,720
Scott: And it's just a card that's basically worthless, that has no power, but to get it out of your hand costs a mana, so, and it takes up a spot on the board.

693
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:35,960
Scott: So unless you have some other card to synergize with the rock that would make it advantageous, you're not gonna play it, it's just gonna take up space in your hand.

694
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,940
Scott: There's a lot of, it's like a curse in Dominion, right?

695
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:45,580
Scott: So I got some, we both had rocks in our hand, because everything in the game is even fair like that when it's random, which is nice.

696
00:55:46,662 --> 00:55:47,944
Scott: And then another location appeared.

697
00:55:47,984 --> 00:55:57,220
Scott: that said, both players, at random, to have one card from their hand automatically played at this location for free, right?

698
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:07,180
Scott: And so the other player had rocks in their hand, and so did I, but a rock came out of my hand for free, which is, you know, it's not that harmful, it eats up a spot, I didn't lose a mana.

699
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:14,720
Scott: But, you know, it's out of my hand, which is nice, but it's like, it's obviously the worst result, you'd rather get something big for free, right?

700
00:56:15,221 --> 00:56:24,900
Scott: The other player got the hulk for free at that location, right, who is, it's like, some other people have reported this exact scenario happening, so I wonder if it's a scripted thing.

701
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:37,520
Rym: So, the exact same thing happened to me in one of my early matches, the exact same thing happened to our friend Matt in one of his early matches, the exact same thing happened to some people I saw on Twitter, because I was still looking at Twitter back then.

702
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:57,820
Rym: We have a lot of evidence that many, possibly most, of your early plays, if you start playing this game from nothing, are scripted entirely, not just to teach you the game, but to expose you to the highs and lows of the game, and make it an engaging and interesting experience.

703
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:03,580
Scott: Because remember, one of the things that Richard Garfield talked about-- And expose you to the mechanics of the game without the interference of another person.

704
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:14,136
Rym: But also expose you to, like, the high highs and the low lows, like, the ridiculous once-in-a-lifetime nonsense that happens in a game, the wombo combo that you celebrate.

705
00:57:14,536 --> 00:57:16,920
Rym: You experience that, like, on your fourth game ever.

706
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:22,068
Scott: Yep, so this, obviously, is, on the one hand, incredible, right?

707
00:57:22,108 --> 00:57:28,078
Scott: That's a hilarious play, it's thematic, it's fun, if it happened at a tournament, people would be going like, "Oh, shit!

708
00:57:28,098 --> 00:57:28,139
Rym: Oh!"

709
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:29,301
Rym: Right?

710
00:57:29,641 --> 00:57:32,607
Scott: But it's entirely luck-based, right?

711
00:57:32,787 --> 00:57:40,100
Scott: I didn't lose, up until that point, I had not lost a single game, and I only lost that game because of luck.

712
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,940
Rym: But remember, a game takes between 20 and 90 seconds to play.

713
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:52,017
Scott: Yep, but I told myself when I started, because I could clearly tell what kind of game this was, that I would uninstall as soon as I lost.

714
00:57:52,257 --> 00:57:53,160
Scott: So that was my final game.

715
00:57:53,160 --> 00:58:00,240
Rym: Yeah, I have played several hundred games of this to really, like, interrogate the mechanics, and I am at a point where I only win about half my games.

716
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:26,360
Rym: The advanced play will get into the whole collectible nonsense and, like, the problems with the monetization in a second, but assuming you have all the cards, and you're not just, like, lacking a card that someone has that's just better, then the game comes down to who made the most clever deck with a little bit of paper-rock-scissors, and after that, who plays perfectly mathematically optimally, which, if you're a reasonably intelligent adult, not hard to do.

717
00:58:27,101 --> 00:58:33,480
Scott: And then number three-- No, but a professional player, even the most professional players will make a mistake sometimes, right?

718
00:58:33,921 --> 00:58:36,020
Scott: And in those games, they're gonna lose because they made a mistake.

719
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:42,770
Rym: Yep, and then the third thing is it will just be random, but that's where the doubling cube comes in, because this game is more like poker.

720
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:47,817
Rym: If you're playing this game seriously, forgetting the collectible card shit will get into.

721
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:50,020
Rym: I keep saying that because it's a deal-breaker, that part.

722
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:55,750
Rym: The real skill is, if random shit happens, just resign.

723
00:58:55,790 --> 00:59:02,420
Rym: Like, you gotta use that cube, that snap, effectively and elegantly-- As soon as the Hulk came out, I resigned.

724
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:05,280
Scott: I might have actually played one more card and then resigned.

725
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,361
Rym: Yep, you just resign.

726
00:59:06,681 --> 00:59:25,280
Rym: And if you treat this game like poker, play it well, make good decks, study the meta, and you are very willing to resign and you don't snap stupidly, the game is still on the level, if you play dozens of games, primarily skill-based in the end, because you're gonna advance faster if you are smarter and better.

727
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:48,240
Scott: If you're smarter and better at this game, even though every individual game will be determined by luck or what cards people drew or my deck happened to be a rock to his deck scissors or vice versa, even though all those things on the level of an individual match, you're not gonna be able to really have much control over the result.

728
00:59:49,061 --> 01:00:04,980
Scott: If your positional heuristics and understanding of the game and just knowing who's going to win earlier, right, are better than the other players, over the course of many, many games, you will win more and lose less and rise in the ranks and be better.

729
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:11,980
Scott: I would also say-- Even though, once you get to some certain rank, the outcomes of individual matches are primarily luck-based.

730
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:12,240
Scott: Yep,

731
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:30,180
Rym: I would also say that even though you will definitely lose games by absolute, uncontrollable, ridiculous randomness, because the games are so short, that ends up being fun, to the point that I'm not even mad about stasis decks, not even mad about, like, literally lose control of the game.

732
01:00:30,281 --> 01:00:32,519
Scott: Yeah, you could just resign immediately, too.

733
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:40,907
Rym: Or just let it play, and within 40 seconds, you are playing a brand new match, and it really just washes out.

734
01:00:40,967 --> 01:00:47,613
Rym: The skill will come to the top, except this is a free-to-play game, and the way they monetize it is.

735
01:00:47,873 --> 01:00:55,660
Rym: you either have to grind a terrifying amount to get all the cards, and the later cards are just better.

736
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,819
Scott: Like, there are combos-- Not all of them, but most of them.

737
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:05,054
Rym: But also, without the later cards, you cannot do anything advanced, you cannot make good, clever combos.

738
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:07,900
Rym: You are just missing out on the fun part of the game.

739
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:15,511
Scott: Right, so the way the unlocking works is that there's a whole bunch of different, bunch of fucking systems, right, because they can just have one way to do it, right?

740
01:01:15,531 --> 01:01:16,973
Scott: They can have all these different ways, right?

741
01:01:17,034 --> 01:01:25,580
Scott: It's like, you level up your fucking season pass by playing and winning-- It is poisonous, toxic free-to-play, just like every other poisonous, toxic free-to-play.

742
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:35,215
Scott: Right, it's like when you play cards, those cards that you play get points, and when a card gets enough points, it can upgrade, right, and frame break, and all that, right?

743
01:01:35,235 --> 01:01:38,420
Scott: So basically, the cards upgrade individually, cosmetically, right?

744
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:42,225
Scott: So you start off with a boring Spider-Man card, just a regular old Spider-Man card, right?

745
01:01:42,605 --> 01:01:45,228
Scott: And you eventually upgrade that Spider-Man card.

746
01:01:45,248 --> 01:01:54,660
Scott: It gets fancier looking, there's holograms and alternate arts, and each card has several different visual, you know, cosmetic options, right?

747
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:59,045
Scott: Many of which are, they're all fucking awesome, right, all of them.

748
01:01:59,245 --> 01:02:02,028
Scott: The artist team, they're S tier, right?

749
01:02:02,108 --> 01:02:12,760
Scott: It's like, you know, and it's Marvel, so I guess it's even easier, right, to get all that years of IP to work on, but, you know, still amazing art, you know, however easy you want to say it is, I couldn't draw any of that shit.

750
01:02:13,281 --> 01:02:25,940
Scott: But, you upgrade cards cosmetically, and the more you do that, the more you level up on this other meter that unlocks actual cards that you can now have the option to put into your deck, right?

751
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:36,640
Scott: So, you can spend fucking real money to unlock shit, but it costs a lot, I didn't calculate how much, I'm sure someone on the internet did, but it ain't cheap, it ain't worth it.

752
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:37,109
Scott: Nope.

753
01:02:38,322 --> 01:02:42,040
Scott: Or, you can grind your way, just keep playing until you unlock all the cards.

754
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:59,356
Rym: So, as far as I have played, I have played many hundreds of matches, I ranked up to upper silver local, I do not have even, like, half the cards, and 100% of the time I lose a match, the other person has a card I don't have.

755
01:02:59,376 --> 01:03:03,020
Rym: that is a way better combo, and I have no way to counter that.

756
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:04,241
Scott: Nope.

757
01:03:05,003 --> 01:03:11,179
Scott: So, yeah, I mean, if this game offered some option that was, like, a reasonable price, say, 20 bucks.

758
01:03:11,641 --> 01:03:13,440
Rym: I would pay 40 bucks to just have every card.

759
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:18,254
Scott: Or, monthly fee, I would pay 5 bucks a month, right?

760
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:19,880
Scott: Some, yeah, maybe.

761
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:20,802
Scott: Cos the game is.

762
01:03:21,242 --> 01:03:31,200
Rym: objectively, I thought about how, you could play probably 10 to 15 snaps in the time it takes to play one Nershima Hex, it's a better poopin' game than Nershima Hex.

763
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:37,932
Scott: Yeah, but I was saying, it's like, you know, because it's a game that's continuously updated, they're always adding more content, right?

764
01:03:37,993 --> 01:03:41,580
Scott: So, it's like, if I pay 30 bucks once for all the cards, it's like, well, now they add new cards.

765
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:47,240
Rym: But if I had to pay, like, 10 bucks a season to get the next set of cards, I'm not even opposed to that.

766
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:59,020
Scott: Yeah, I'm not opposed to paying for this game, what I'm opposed to is that even a substantial time or money investment, I don't even care about getting all the cosmetics, even though it's actually kinda awesome in this game, right?

767
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:08,080
Scott: It's like, I just wanna be on a level playing field with the top, you know, with everybody else, and have every card, and I want my opponents to have every card.

768
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:12,220
Scott: I don't wanna just win because I got some card the other person doesn't have, that's some bullshit, right?

769
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:24,040
Scott: I want everyone to have access to all the same cards, and then play that very good, you know, light game in the spare moments of my day, and then I would be into it.

770
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:27,340
Scott: But because that is not the way it is done, I uninstalled the game.

771
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:38,300
Rym: The grind is exponential to get all the cards, it is the full-on free-to-play experience, there are at least three currencies in-game, I don't know which one does what because I do not care.

772
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:46,969
Scott: Yep, so that's a disappointment on what would otherwise be really, really good, like, you know, top tier.

773
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:55,760
Scott: as far as the toilet multiplayer, like, it's like, has there even been a multiplayer online game, phone or otherwise?

774
01:04:57,262 --> 01:05:03,660
Rym: The only games I can play against another human while I'm pooping on my phone are asynchronous games.

775
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:20,260
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you could play, you know, for a multiplayer toilet game, right, you could play the other card games like a Hearthstone or a Magic Arena, but it's like, those take a while, that's one, maybe you'll get a match in, maybe not, it could be a long one, right?

776
01:05:20,641 --> 01:05:30,760
Scott: It's like, there is no other real multiplayer online competitive actual strategy game that you can play more than once in a poop, right?

777
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:32,724
Scott: This is it, right?

778
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:39,940
Scott: And that is very compelling, but not compelling enough for me to grind away my time or money in order to play it properly.

779
01:05:39,980 --> 01:06:07,760
Scott: There's also, as far as I can tell, no competitive organized structure, there's no tournaments, there's no way to say I want to play against my friend Rym and play only against my friend Rym, there's no private lobbies, there's no, you know, way to have a tournament on Twitch, there's nothing, they might add that at some point, but as far as I can tell, none of that exists, you can only just play a game against a rando and then play a game against another rando and that's all you can do.

780
01:06:08,402 --> 01:06:13,120
Rym: I have played four games against randos since the one I lost a little while ago on my phone while we're doing the show.

781
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:21,471
Scott: Yeah, but it's like, if I could have, you know, even Hearthstone lets you play against a specific person in your battle net friends list, right?

782
01:06:21,531 --> 01:06:27,540
Scott: It's like, if that was a thing, then I could have maybe almost gotten into it a little bit more.

783
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:33,539
Scott: Yeah, because if I would just play against- I could have found a Discord server of serious players and played against them.

784
01:06:34,142 --> 01:06:39,780
Rym: Or we could just play amongst, like, our friends and nobody, no one we know- Yeah, everyone has the same cards, right?

785
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:46,400
Rym: They'd be close enough, because nobody we know would grind that much, the grind is exponential, and nobody we know would spend that much money.

786
01:06:48,001 --> 01:07:00,560
Scott: To their credit, I will say that even though you have to grind away with money or time to unlock all these cards, they did not do any loot boxes or boosters or random shit.

787
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:12,460
Scott: You can't sit there, as far as I can see, there might be there that I just didn't see it, I don't think you can buy packs of cards and then, like, disintegrate the doubles to get points and leftover currency.

788
01:07:12,681 --> 01:07:19,020
Scott: Nope, there's none of that randomness, the progression of unlocking cards- That's good, that is good that they don't have that.

789
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:26,719
Rym: It's the same thing New Overwatch did, where in Switch, funnily enough, nerds are complaining about, because they want the loot boxes, they want that randomness to-.

790
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:33,000
Scott: Of course, those nerds are there, because they just like gambling and collecting, they're not interested in actually playing a game.

791
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:39,880
Rym: This is the new design pattern, to get away from the loot boxes, because I think the entire industry sees that that's going to get cracked down on eventually.

792
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:45,893
Scott: Yeah, I actually don't see a problem, it's like, keep all the grindy bullshit you have, right?

793
01:07:45,913 --> 01:07:48,660
Scott: The kid with no money can grind his time away, right?

794
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:54,593
Scott: The person who's mega rich can, you know, who wants all the cosmetics, right?

795
01:07:54,613 --> 01:07:57,420
Scott: They can spend, they can be a whale and spend all the money, right?

796
01:07:58,081 --> 01:08:11,620
Scott: Add just the third option, which is, you don't get any cosmetic bonuses, but you do get every card at the non, the weakest cosmetic level to play with, because you care about playing the game, and it costs a flat fee.

797
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:17,000
Scott: Just add that one payment option, and I'm installing this game again, right away.

798
01:08:18,301 --> 01:08:26,540
Scott: But it's not there, so you're going to have to decide for yourself, you know, how much, if at all, you're going to engage with this game.

799
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:41,240
Rym: I would say it is worth playing up until you get bored with it, or you hit silver rank and then quit, because, one, I want you to see how this game ramps on board a new player with the scripted events and the bots.

800
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:43,720
Scott: There's a lot of good design in here.

801
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:50,814
Rym: That is brilliantly designed, and two, I want you to see how the game functions, because this is a model to steal.

802
01:08:50,874 --> 01:08:53,700
Rym: We are entering the era of a million battle line clones.

803
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,026
Scott: And the user interface is S tier as well, right?

804
01:08:57,167 --> 01:09:01,959
Scott: Except for the menus full of their currency, buying crap, but all the gameplay parts are good interfaces.

805
01:09:01,959 --> 01:09:06,979
Rym: 90% of the menu is just to trick kids into putting real money into the machine.

806
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:09,582
Scott: Yep.

807
01:09:10,582 --> 01:09:24,020
Scott: So yeah, I would recommend, if you enjoy this game, when you stop playing it, because it's a grind, going out and playing shot and totten, battle line, warhammer invasion, if you can find someone to play that with you.

808
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:32,800
Rym: I would even say, even though it's adjacent, it's not the same kind of game, but it shares many characteristics with these games, lost cities.

809
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:35,063
Scott: Similar-ish.

810
01:09:35,363 --> 01:09:36,087
Rym: I guess that's Jason.

811
01:09:36,107 --> 01:09:37,292
Rym: It shares many characteristics.

812
01:09:37,372 --> 01:09:39,158
Scott: It's also a Rainier Canisia, right?

813
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:41,803
Rym: That Rainier Canisia.

814
01:09:41,903 --> 01:09:49,700
Scott: If you think about it, all those FPSs where you're trying to control different points are somewhat in the same category.

815
01:09:50,241 --> 01:09:52,024
Scott: And you can also go to the Colonel Blottos, right?

816
01:09:52,066 --> 01:09:57,240
Scott: You can play, we've done GeekNights episodes about El Grande and, what's it called, the Rumble one?

817
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:58,363
Rym: Oh, Rumble Nation?

818
01:09:58,904 --> 01:09:59,987
Rym: Rumble Kingdom?

819
01:10:00,007 --> 01:10:00,949
Rym: I think it's Rumble Nation.

820
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:02,634
Rym: I already forgot the name of it.

821
01:10:02,874 --> 01:10:05,040
Rym: I assume it came out and I can buy it by now.

822
01:10:06,261 --> 01:10:07,445
Scott: The Japan one.

823
01:10:08,086 --> 01:10:13,160
Scott: Any Colonel Blotto game is just a non-linear, more complex version of this, right?

824
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:16,399
Scott: Putting cubes in places and winning the most places.

825
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:16,661
Scott: What?

826
01:10:16,701 --> 01:10:18,074
Rym: Is it still not released in the US?

827
01:10:18,174 --> 01:10:18,760
Rym: Imports only?

828
01:10:20,185 --> 01:10:20,678
Scott: Oh, good luck.

829
01:10:21,082 --> 01:10:22,720
Rym: It's only like $35 from Hobby Japan.

830
01:10:24,022 --> 01:10:24,606
Scott: Make one.

831
01:10:24,908 --> 01:10:25,794
Scott: It's not a hard game to make.

832
01:10:25,814 --> 01:10:26,580
Scott: You just need some dice.

833
01:10:28,225 --> 01:10:29,898
Rym: I think I might just buy the Japanese one.

834
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:31,762
Scott: Marvel Snap.

835
01:10:31,842 --> 01:10:37,820
Scott: An impressive, impressive game that does a lot of things right, but does a critical thing wrong to keep me personally from playing it more.

836
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,140
Rym: If you want to blame anyone for that, blame capitalism.

837
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:48,960
Scott: But still an excellent thing that is quite unique in this world and I applaud it, even though I won't play it.

838
01:10:53,462 --> 01:10:55,707
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

839
01:10:55,747 --> 01:11:00,760
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

840
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:06,120
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

841
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:09,087
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

842
01:11:09,228 --> 01:11:13,820
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

843
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:17,336
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

844
01:11:18,581 --> 01:11:21,691
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

845
01:11:21,871 --> 01:11:24,780
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

846
01:11:25,561 --> 01:11:55,180
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are... ...York University, York University Station, and a bunch of people who are paying a smaller amount because they do not want or need me to say their names.

847
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,991
Rym: Yeah, I'm pretty much done with Twitter.

848
01:11:58,051 --> 01:11:59,799
Rym: Scott is mostly done with Twitter too.

849
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:05,020
Rym: But if you're hearing these words, you already know how to find us.

850
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:09,520
Rym: And you probably already have a good idea of what our opinions are on anything in particular.

851
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:13,760
Rym: So I think you can live without us tweeting for a little while while we sort this out.

852
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:20,587
Rym: But anyway, for tonight, I leave you with...

853
01:12:23,191 --> 01:12:28,770
Scott: So, come up to the lab and see what's on the slab.

854
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:32,749
Scott: I see you shiver with antici...
