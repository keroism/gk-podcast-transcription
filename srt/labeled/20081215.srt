1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,567
Rym: It's Monday December 15th.

2
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:12,249
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,696
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:15,800
Rym: portable words.

5
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:26,927
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:33,692
Scott: You know I'm pretty good with the with the softwares.

7
00:00:33,953 --> 00:00:35,658
Scott: You know it's that's sort of what I do.

8
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:39,240
Scott: You know make softwares, but for many moons.

9
00:00:39,702 --> 00:00:42,556
Scott: You know the physical bits the electronics have sort of.

10
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:43,500
Scott: you know mystified.

11
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:49,167
Scott: You know it's like I can stick a video card in an AGP slot And I can understand.

12
00:00:49,207 --> 00:00:52,580
Scott: you know the abstracted metaphors for how these technologies work.

13
00:00:53,224 --> 00:01:03,084
Scott: And now when I understand on a fundamental level that there You know pins and electricity and the electricity goes on and it goes off, and there's like these square waves You know if it's at five volts It's one.

14
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,959
Scott: if it's zero volts at zero, but it'll thing.

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:11,900
Rym: But I'm guessing if someone handed you a pile of resistors and such and with said without Google make a flip-flop.

16
00:01:12,102 --> 00:01:12,686
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

17
00:01:12,908 --> 00:01:22,458
Scott: I know PV equals nRT But if you give me a calculator that even though I know that it won't help me for shit cuz I don't know I only know what the V is I?

18
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,127
Scott: Don't know what the n RT or P's are.

19
00:01:26,147 --> 00:01:32,084
Rym: the problem is what will stop most people is the lost art of looking at a resistor And knowing the resistance.

20
00:01:32,104 --> 00:01:38,184
Scott: see I know that there are colors and that they mean something right and I know that those colors match up With a number of ohms.

21
00:01:38,846 --> 00:01:45,127
Scott: I could not tell you which one of those letters in the in the equation is the ohms so That I'm sort of lost.

22
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:47,959
Rym: I almost feel worse because I was kind of a hobbyist.

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,590
Scott: Yeah, I'm when I say hobbyist I'm like I can make a circuit like I know the electricity goes from the.

24
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:54,376
Scott: you know the positive to the ground.

25
00:01:54,396 --> 00:01:58,253
Rym: well well No, the electrons come out of the negative.

26
00:01:58,574 --> 00:01:59,619
Scott: Yeah, but you know you connect it.

27
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,402
Scott: This is circuit.

28
00:02:00,422 --> 00:02:01,225
Scott: it goes in a circle.

29
00:02:01,305 --> 00:02:04,897
Scott: I know how it works right, but it you know I don't.

30
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,065
Scott: I Can't actually do it.

31
00:02:07,105 --> 00:02:07,668
Scott: You know even though.

32
00:02:07,688 --> 00:02:10,740
Scott: I worked with like James who does this for a living for like you know?

33
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,160
Scott: I guess 20 weeks, and I didn't learn enough.

34
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,700
Scott: I mean I learned but not enough to actually do anything.

35
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,589
Scott: But basically the extent of my electronics was you know I?

36
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:30,600
Scott: Wrote some C code that turned one pin on the motherboard like on and I connected a thing to it so I could detect Like I could detect if it was a one or a zero, but that's as basically software.

37
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:32,333
Scott: I didn't actually do any electronics all right.

38
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:33,300
Scott: everyone else did all that.

39
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:46,807
Rym: No, I feel like I'm kind of in a worse situation because I used to be really into that like in middle school elementary school I was soldering stuff all over the place and inside Stuff at summer camp Completely forgot how to do it like.

40
00:02:46,908 --> 00:02:48,174
Rym: I made a really like.

41
00:02:48,214 --> 00:02:49,540
Rym: I made an alarm system for my bed.

42
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:51,679
Scott: I also made an alarm system with two buttons.

43
00:02:52,162 --> 00:02:53,286
Rym: Oh see mine wasn't buttons.

44
00:02:53,326 --> 00:02:56,540
Rym: mine actually was if the circuit was broken it went off.

45
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:57,986
Scott: Well the button was broken.

46
00:02:58,027 --> 00:02:59,433
Scott: the circuit was broken by a button.

47
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:00,317
Rym: see mine was just.

48
00:03:00,398 --> 00:03:00,900
Rym: I had a wire.

49
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:02,573
Rym: I wired it into the door frame.

50
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:03,540
Scott: well see mine.

51
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,966
Scott: I made it and it was sort of loose.

52
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:07,980
Scott: so right and one button was sort of like the arming button.

53
00:03:08,162 --> 00:03:10,099
Scott: It was one of those clicky ones like it locks in.

54
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:14,242
Scott: So if you lock that button in then it was armed and if you unlocked it It was off.

55
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:17,960
Scott: there's also a power switch right and then there was a very loose button.

56
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,668
Scott: It was like one of those silent sort of.

57
00:03:19,728 --> 00:03:20,251
Scott: you know you could.

58
00:03:20,472 --> 00:03:22,200
Scott: it would get pushed if you like tapped it a little bit.

59
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,733
Scott: Yeah, yep, and so if it got pushed past a certain point It would cut it and then in the alarm was set.

60
00:03:27,753 --> 00:03:31,632
Rym: so there was basically a current Going across where the door is and the window.

61
00:03:32,436 --> 00:03:33,340
Rym: and if the voltage?

62
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,620
Scott: Yeah, I mean I could have done the same exact thing.

63
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,663
Scott: Just you know by taking the wires off getting longer wires and putting different switches on instead of using switches I set it up to where.

64
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:45,480
Rym: if the voltage dropped across that whole why could he just use like magnet switches?

65
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:49,667
Scott: You know what the magnets are closed to each other, but then when they move up that cuts it, and that's it You know.

66
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:54,800
Rym: yeah But do you remember how to make a circuit where if you lose signal on one wire the other wire?

67
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,219
Scott: I know when I made this thing I was in summer camp But I had a little chart.

68
00:03:58,461 --> 00:04:07,166
Scott: And you know even though we even made the boards there like we drew on the boards of the magic marker And they were just copper and then they put him in acid for us And they came out.

69
00:04:07,488 --> 00:04:08,535
Scott: and then you know the tree.

70
00:04:08,555 --> 00:04:09,340
Rym: we didn't get to do that.

71
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:12,119
Rym: I just had piles of bread boards that I periodically broke.

72
00:04:12,862 --> 00:04:15,494
Scott: See I could use a bread board to practice some soldering on.

73
00:04:15,675 --> 00:04:18,630
Rym: so I remember very specifically I was saying it's soldering.

74
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:20,060
Scott: I got taught by an Australian guy.

75
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:29,897
Rym: I was in like third grade and then I forgot I was soldering something together And I was following this diagram and the the friendly gnome I knew who taught me how to solder and taught me how to do all this stuff.

76
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:35,519
Rym: no But this this man was the closest thing to a gnome that the real world has ever seen.

77
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,632
Rym: Him and his whole family were gnomes.

78
00:04:37,873 --> 00:04:42,080
Rym: they lived in a house That was nothing more than a giant engineering project lived in a tree.

79
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:47,640
Rym: They were all and they rode on a. him and his wife and his daughter red triangle hat.

80
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:51,590
Rym: Him his wife and his daughter were all engineers for a living.

81
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:53,195
Rym: they both had him and his wife.

82
00:04:53,215 --> 00:04:54,800
Rym: both had doctorates in engineering.

83
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,304
Rym: I forget what.

84
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:56,999
Scott: David the gnome rode around on fuck.

85
00:04:57,742 --> 00:05:02,660
Rym: This is the guy who would hand me two wires and say you may feel a shock don't.

86
00:05:06,703 --> 00:05:08,369
Rym: But I remember I was in soldering something together.

87
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:09,413
Rym: he's like can you read a schematic?

88
00:05:09,774 --> 00:05:10,156
Rym: and I'm like.

89
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,727
Rym: yes Yes, I can.

90
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:14,074
Rym: and he's like really.

91
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,907
Rym: so he shows me a schematic He's like does this look like?

92
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,635
Rym: what you think a schematic is now is like.

93
00:05:18,655 --> 00:05:23,289
Rym: no No, I'm using this and he's like that's a diagram.

94
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:29,215
Rym: This is a schematic sit down boy, and you're going to learn ha electronics actually work, so

95
00:05:29,316 --> 00:05:41,138
Scott: I went and There's this Arduino thing right which is basically like this open-source Board and there are plenty of other plenty of other like boards and chips you can get that you can program stuff on.

96
00:05:41,178 --> 00:05:47,648
Scott: there's like There's like basic stamps and all these other things right there basically Chips that are really easy to program.

97
00:05:47,668 --> 00:06:06,780
Scott: you connect it to your computer with a serial port you write some software You push a button the software goes over to the chip and then the chip is connected to a board and then there's like some pins on the board and you can program whether they go on or off and then there's some other ones That are input so you can detect whether the in what's coming in is on or off and then you can make things happen.

98
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,101
Scott: Right.

99
00:06:07,803 --> 00:06:10,813
Scott: so this Arduino one is like these super open-source one.

100
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:15,020
Scott: You know it's not like super powerful It's not like the best thing ever.

101
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:20,539
Scott: It's you know it's limited, but it's super open-source and super everything like that and works with USB.

102
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:30,944
Scott: So I went to like to make magazine store And I bought like the whole thing and then I went to some other places And I bought all the other stuff, and I pretty much have everything now except I actually need some solder.

103
00:06:31,185 --> 00:06:32,309
Scott: I got to go to some Radio Shack.

104
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:33,835
Rym: Yeah, you know it's solder.

105
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:42,316
Rym: right yeah, but I got Okay, as long as you admit that it is actually solder, which you just did, but I'm Australian now.

106
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,125
Rym: Oh Are you?

107
00:06:44,225 --> 00:06:45,597
Scott: yes, I got a solder.

108
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:52,260
Rym: So the circuits what's the capital of Australia, Melbourne, okay, yeah anyway?

109
00:06:55,904 --> 00:06:58,420
Scott: Right so I got all this stuff, and I can learn how to use it.

110
00:06:58,582 --> 00:06:59,560
Scott: I'm gonna be all dangerous.

111
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:09,719
Scott: And then maybe one day I will make something that will you know sort of appear on all the websites like oh my god guy Makes you know small version of something.

112
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:13,411
Scott: Guy makes this piece of technology.

113
00:07:13,472 --> 00:07:15,100
Scott: talk to this other piece of technology.

114
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,979
Scott: There's another.

115
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:24,480
Rym: It really depends which website you get on because the article headline might be guy solders finger to other finger found dead.

116
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:26,216
Scott: I thought that's gonna happen.

117
00:07:27,723 --> 00:07:36,133
Rym: I can say one thing I did once drip hot solder Into my thumbnail once like between the nail and the finger mmm.

118
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:38,820
Rym: That was possibly the worst experience of my life.

119
00:07:39,184 --> 00:07:43,027
Scott: Yeah, it's not gonna happen But I have to.

120
00:07:43,268 --> 00:07:50,020
Scott: I need to get like it like a. I think I'm just gonna take some of the old things we have Lying around that's that are crappy and try to practice the soldering on them.

121
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:50,764
Rym: You know you can do.

122
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,634
Rym: I got that old motherboard with all the busted caps.

123
00:07:52,654 --> 00:07:54,124
Rym: you should take them all off and put them back On.

124
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:55,339
Scott: I could try that.

125
00:07:56,042 --> 00:08:04,396
Scott: The thing is that all the soldering I have to do is through the hole and a lot of stuff on modern Technology is surface mount and surface mount is like very hard and also.

126
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,858
Scott: I'm never gonna do anything I'm only gonna do through the hole, so I don't know.

127
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:13,920
Rym: Anyway, well I can say one thing if you're not worried about it actually working you can treat all those as through the hole.

128
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:15,348
Scott: I guess that's true.

129
00:08:15,388 --> 00:08:17,260
Scott: I just poke holes in it.

130
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,089
Rym: No There are things because they're not the little Tiny goings that are on the side or surface mount.

131
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:25,220
Rym: the big ones on my old a bit motherboard are through the hole effective really.

132
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,487
Scott: So I could like in the hole.

133
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,776
Rym: Yeah, I know through the hole you could do it.

134
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:31,852
Scott: anyway I got a you know what.

135
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,383
Rym: well I got.

136
00:08:33,403 --> 00:08:40,337
Scott: go buy like a pack of resistors that are like you know less than a cent each And they're just like sold to the mall to a thing full of holes.

137
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:48,760
Rym: just to practice You know I like the idea of what you know getting a house and all that and then trying to make the whole house Super awesomely automated like a lot of yeah, but it's a lot.

138
00:08:49,002 --> 00:08:51,140
Scott: You know that you know it's much easier.

139
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,136
Scott: Just buy something that does that rather than try to make all.

140
00:08:54,196 --> 00:08:56,840
Rym: yes to a point But you buy the things that do the basic things.

141
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,943
Rym: But if you want to do the one complicated thing for which no one made a simple thing That's true.

142
00:09:02,123 --> 00:09:03,088
Rym: Then you got to do this.

143
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,418
Scott: actually I was thinking of one thing that might be cool.

144
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:05,699
Scott: right?

145
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:13,900
Scott: is You get a Wi-Fi thing right and you get the chip and a battery or you connect it to the wall or whatever right?

146
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:33,314
Scott: and basically have a switch like physical switches for all the people who live in your house right like maybe three-way switches and then LEDs and then you just write their name on it And then you flick a switch and it will like connect to the jabber and be like so when you leave the house you could Just be like away with a switch.

147
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:38,597
Scott: Huh when you come back call me be like home and it will just change it.

148
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:41,072
Rym: by that logic Why don't you just have an app on your iPhone?

149
00:09:41,092 --> 00:09:42,260
Scott: that that's what I'm saying.

150
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,978
Rym: You know a series of presets like left the house or even better the night tie it to the GPS.

151
00:09:47,998 --> 00:09:51,396
Rym: the main problem When you get home, it just says rims.

152
00:09:51,597 --> 00:09:52,847
Scott: Oh, yeah I thought of that.

153
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:57,971
Scott: you know what the problem is because the iPhone doesn't have any sort of multitasking or background tasking.

154
00:09:58,172 --> 00:10:09,460
Scott: you would actually have to go turn on the iPhone Go to the app push the buttons while this internet around and then like, you know Turn off the iPhone and like you have to wait for the GPS to get your location.

155
00:10:09,822 --> 00:10:11,207
Scott: It's like you have to do all this stuff.

156
00:10:11,268 --> 00:10:13,055
Scott: There's a lot more work than flicking us away.

157
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:14,160
Rym: So, you know, this is the problem.

158
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,920
Rym: We're so close to having all the things I've wanted my whole life.

159
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,783
Rym: Did she want?

160
00:10:18,824 --> 00:10:21,374
Scott: yeah get the get the g1 from t-mobile, you know what?

161
00:10:21,414 --> 00:10:22,760
Scott: the battery doesn't last all day.

162
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:26,192
Scott: Yeah, cuz it sits there all day doing all that shit that you wanted to do.

163
00:10:26,352 --> 00:10:27,737
Rym: That's why I just gotta wait.

164
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:32,955
Scott: Yep Maybe the zinc air batteries that they're talking about will help you.

165
00:10:33,497 --> 00:10:33,938
Rym: We'll see.

166
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:36,866
Scott: Yeah Alright, so check this out, right?

167
00:10:37,488 --> 00:10:38,331
Scott: There's a the.

168
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:41,060
Scott: there's been a recent hub of mostly today.

169
00:10:41,562 --> 00:10:45,120
Scott: It's sort of been like the comeback of net neutrality as an issue, right?

170
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:55,019
Scott: and basically what's happened here is the Wall Street Journal and some other people have sort of Not understood what net neutrality means.

171
00:10:56,482 --> 00:11:01,237
Scott: So I feel I have to re-explain this to everyone to make sure that it's clear right.

172
00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:06,232
Scott: so Originally, this is where net neutrality first became an issue.

173
00:11:06,372 --> 00:11:07,236
Scott: was this right?

174
00:11:07,256 --> 00:11:14,780
Scott: I Go to someone who sells internet internet service provider, maybe the cable company the phone company someone else, right?

175
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,403
Scott: I get a connection.

176
00:11:16,464 --> 00:11:18,390
Scott: It's a t1 whatever right?

177
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:20,658
Scott: It's so many megabits per second.

178
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:21,200
Scott: Okay?

179
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:25,255
Scott: They I pay for the t1.

180
00:11:26,182 --> 00:11:27,286
Scott: That's all I pay for.

181
00:11:27,326 --> 00:11:32,590
Scott: if I use it a lot or if I use it a little bit I pay The same right?

182
00:11:32,871 --> 00:11:33,233
Scott: It doesn't.

183
00:11:33,334 --> 00:11:34,360
Scott: it doesn't change, right?

184
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:48,660
Scott: What they wanted to do was what what some of the internet service providers want to do is They wanted to say hey look right, you know on the other end of the internet service, right?

185
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,005
Scott: So I'm on this end with my t1.

186
00:11:50,206 --> 00:11:58,253
Scott: on the other end is Google, right if I visit Google Right, then Google's data is going over their line.

187
00:11:58,313 --> 00:12:00,500
Scott: So they feel like they should be able to charge Google.

188
00:12:01,282 --> 00:12:08,363
Scott: They are charging Google Google's paying for internet connections on its side to some you know to someone else and then it's just this big Network.

189
00:12:08,464 --> 00:12:10,519
Rym: everyone pretty much just boils down to that.

190
00:12:11,383 --> 00:12:23,540
Rym: pretty much everyone who knows about the technology agrees that the ISPs and the high-level providers and the internet itself Should be completely agnostic to the content and the originator of the content.

191
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:30,593
Scott: Yes, so what they wanted to do is they wanted to say, all right, look, you know Google You should pay us, you know more because you're using more of our bandwidth.

192
00:12:30,774 --> 00:12:35,860
Scott: or they were gonna say, all right, look Everyone we're still gonna let all the traffic go through.

193
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,200
Scott: So if you visit Google, it'll still make it to the other side.

194
00:12:38,301 --> 00:12:43,694
Scott: But if Google pays us money Then it'll be faster for you people to visit Google.

195
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:45,060
Scott: then it'll be for you to visit.

196
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:48,311
Scott: You know say Yahoo, right unless Yahoo also pays us money.

197
00:12:48,692 --> 00:13:04,160
Scott: So what that would be is actually It's not net neutral because different things you are visiting are getting like You know preferential treatment and the other things that you are visiting are getting sort of demoted, right?

198
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,479
Scott: So the actual what is going over the lines is being discriminated against right?

199
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:12,086
Scott: Basically what happened here right?

200
00:13:12,146 --> 00:13:13,631
Scott: is Google said hey look here.

201
00:13:13,671 --> 00:13:17,344
Scott: We got a plan here called open edge I think is there.

202
00:13:17,806 --> 00:13:19,131
Scott: is there a profit?

203
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:28,720
Scott: the name of their plan here and The idea For Google's thing was that they were gonna put servers.

204
00:13:29,001 --> 00:13:36,120
Scott: They wanted to pay ISPs to put their Google servers, you know co-locate them at the ISP.

205
00:13:36,843 --> 00:13:39,880
Scott: So I use we have Cablevision here right Optima online.

206
00:13:40,462 --> 00:13:45,300
Scott: So instead of Google getting preferential treatment on the networking side, right?

207
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,660
Scott: What would happen is Google would just put a server at Cablevision and then they wouldn't get any preferential treatment.

208
00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:58,020
Scott: But it would just be faster because Google has the server right there instead of it going all the way to you know Mountain View, California, or wherever it is, right?

209
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:04,679
Scott: So that's perfectly net neutral as long as anyone who can afford it is also allowed to.

210
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:05,958
Scott: you know Put servers there.

211
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:16,140
Scott: so What happened is, you know, Google came out with this and you know, Larry Lessig Who's a who's a net neutrality supporter came out and said that was cool.

212
00:14:16,782 --> 00:14:21,660
Scott: But all these other people who misunderstood it were like, oh, you know, I thought you guys are for net neutrality.

213
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,643
Scott: Now you're against it.

214
00:14:22,704 --> 00:14:27,320
Scott: given Google preferential treatment, you know, you know, why should Google be faster?

215
00:14:27,881 --> 00:14:29,447
Scott: It's like it's not.

216
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,852
Scott: it is net neutral.

217
00:14:30,872 --> 00:14:32,860
Scott: They're putting up servers in a different place.

218
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:38,120
Scott: We're not modifying the network to make Google packets go faster and other people's packets go slower.

219
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:44,191
Scott: We're just putting Google servers out there And as long as anyone who can afford it can do the same thing.

220
00:14:44,211 --> 00:14:49,990
Rym: because at the same time ISPs do have the discretion to.

221
00:14:50,131 --> 00:15:03,140
Rym: if you're gonna host a server to Refuse to do business with people on various reasons Like for example, if someone's the known spammer lost ISPs if they find out we'll say look No, you can't use our service and all the spammers then up on those shady ISPs.

222
00:15:04,043 --> 00:15:12,408
Scott: Oh you want to see that there's a difference between Spamming and putting out viruses where you're sort of violating You know the the terms of service and whatnot.

223
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:24,856
Rym: and as opposed to just what I'm putting out a podcast that they don't like What if I just make a terms of service that I update every time I get a customer I like that says I only offer this to these specific companies and no one else.

224
00:15:24,876 --> 00:15:25,940
Scott: that's not net neutral.

225
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,727
Scott: It's not cool.

226
00:15:26,768 --> 00:15:28,080
Rym: But what's the specific line?

227
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:28,622
Rym: What?

228
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,250
Rym: what am I allowed to discriminate against?

229
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,400
Rym: and what am I not allowed to discriminate against?

230
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,873
Scott: You're allowed to discriminate against spam and illegal things not like.

231
00:15:37,913 --> 00:15:39,680
Rym: what is what is spam?

232
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,780
Scott: Unsolicited emails.

233
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:45,965
Rym: Alright, so how do you know for sure?

234
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:46,929
Scott: What do you mean?

235
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:47,872
Scott: How do I know for sure?

236
00:15:47,952 --> 00:15:48,836
Scott: It's obvious.

237
00:15:49,217 --> 00:15:49,960
Rym: Is it really though?

238
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,526
Rym: Yeah, a new company.

239
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:53,800
Rym: They have you you know, they their name isn't Google anywhere.

240
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:56,559
Rym: They're a fresh new company and they want to buy hosting with you.

241
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,387
Rym: All right, they're actually spammers.

242
00:15:59,427 --> 00:16:00,210
Rym: they start spamming.

243
00:16:00,952 --> 00:16:03,220
Scott: I look at the emails which are perfectly visible.

244
00:16:03,522 --> 00:16:04,369
Rym: What do you mean?

245
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:05,055
Rym: you look at the emails?

246
00:16:05,075 --> 00:16:05,640
Rym: What do you look for?

247
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,963
Scott: Viagra's OG.

248
00:16:09,023 --> 00:16:17,539
Scott: I wonder or hey, look, I'm getting a bunch of emails to abuse at me and they all say hey I'm getting fucking spam from you bitches.

249
00:16:17,941 --> 00:16:22,780
Rym: All right, but spam in many cases is not actually illegal if it's done in certain ways.

250
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,269
Rym: So where are you gonna draw the line?

251
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,940
Scott: because Eddie legal spam?

252
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:36,776
Rym: Okay, so the only way the only thing you can possibly discriminate against if you're an ISP is If the thing that they want to do is actually directly illegal.

253
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:40,819
Rym: Yeah Alright, what if you don't you ran out of rack space?

254
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,699
Rym: We mean somebody one more person wants to buy a service and you don't have any more rack space.

255
00:16:47,322 --> 00:16:48,668
Scott: Yeah, you know more.

256
00:16:48,729 --> 00:16:56,116
Scott: it's that's like if someone wants to buy a banana and I'm the girls All the bananas so I may I buy I have one you of rack space.

257
00:16:56,237 --> 00:16:57,079
Rym: I sell it to Google's.

258
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,722
Rym: now I'm full.

259
00:16:58,385 --> 00:16:59,610
Rym: All right, is that okay?

260
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,900
Scott: You sell it to first come first serve.

261
00:17:02,442 --> 00:17:06,160
Rym: I open I make the rack space for Google and then I don't make any more.

262
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:09,671
Scott: See, but we're not talking about making rack space for people.

263
00:17:09,691 --> 00:17:10,935
Scott: We're talking about co-location.

264
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:12,382
Rym: Yes co-location So they co.

265
00:17:12,402 --> 00:17:19,019
Rym: look I allow Google to co-locate in the one cubby hole that I have free for co-location And now it's full that no one else can do it.

266
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,440
Scott: That's fine because you're not doing anything on the network side.

267
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:32,379
Rym: Okay, that's what I was saying because it sounded like you were saying that if I offer a service to anyone as an ISP I have to offer it to everyone no matter what unless it's illegal, but it sounds like now that's not the case.

268
00:17:33,243 --> 00:17:35,150
Scott: Well, no, it's just you know, I was just talking to.

269
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,538
Scott: but net neutrality is about the network.

270
00:17:37,739 --> 00:17:39,190
Rym: Yes That's not what I'm trying to make.

271
00:17:39,231 --> 00:17:44,071
Scott: it's not about you know Who puts servers where anyone could put servers anywhere they want to.

272
00:17:44,152 --> 00:17:45,074
Scott: it's about the network.

273
00:17:45,115 --> 00:17:46,860
Scott: You shouldn't filter packets.

274
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:51,440
Scott: You shouldn't you know make some packets slower in some packets faster.

275
00:17:52,042 --> 00:18:01,732
Scott: All the packets are just treated as faceless packets headed towards their destination and they get sent to their destination With you know, the best possible service available.

276
00:18:01,813 --> 00:18:03,620
Rym: So how do I do QoS though?

277
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,652
Rym: What if what if my network gets saturated and not everything's gonna get through?

278
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:09,780
Scott: am I allowed to you just do it evenly?

279
00:18:10,326 --> 00:18:11,520
Rym: What do you mean evenly though?

280
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:21,587
Rym: That doesn't really work so well because UDP versus TCP taking it evenly from TCP will greatly affect performance while taking it evenly from UDP, especially if it's like streaming video.

281
00:18:21,607 --> 00:18:22,551
Scott: Yes, but you are.

282
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:28,714
Scott: if you're doing a TCP versus UDP thing Then you're doing a fair and even thing across.

283
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:32,187
Scott: you're not discriminating by Content or by who it is.

284
00:18:32,247 --> 00:18:35,740
Scott: So the line emanating by it's all TCP and all UDP.

285
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:44,031
Rym: So it's okay to discriminate at layer three or four but not layer five or layer Based on people or content.

286
00:18:44,091 --> 00:18:46,018
Scott: you're just you know, it's just across the board.

287
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:46,520
Rym: It's the content.

288
00:18:47,185 --> 00:18:48,780
Rym: It's the content of the layer two packet.

289
00:18:49,802 --> 00:18:51,790
Scott: But it's not the what they're doing.

290
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,220
Scott: It's not Skype versus eBay versus Google.

291
00:18:54,461 --> 00:18:57,772
Scott: It's you know, it it's just you know, it's all.

292
00:18:57,893 --> 00:18:59,980
Scott: UDP needs to slow down because we don't have any more.

293
00:19:00,463 --> 00:19:08,343
Rym: Alright, so I just completely throttled UDP Which will screw up a lot of the a lot of these shady peer-to-peer things and Happens to.

294
00:19:08,404 --> 00:19:10,374
Scott: but it's all UDP and it's you're not.

295
00:19:10,414 --> 00:19:11,319
Scott: you're not cutting it.

296
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:13,366
Rym: You're Equally, so I'm just here.

297
00:19:13,407 --> 00:19:15,419
Rym: I'm allowed to discriminate against all UDP.

298
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,604
Scott: Am I allowed to?

299
00:19:16,644 --> 00:19:27,280
Scott: you can't do it, but if you you know, if you're if you're net where you got to manage your network Yes, so am I allowed to discriminate against all port 9008?

300
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,726
Rym: Regardless of content, I'm just see.

301
00:19:28,746 --> 00:19:29,590
Rym: here's here's the point.

302
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,775
Rym: I'm trying to make no.

303
00:19:31,076 --> 00:19:36,110
Rym: net neutrality Is very difficult to define from a legal perspective.

304
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,314
Rym: This is the biggest issue.

305
00:19:37,354 --> 00:19:39,400
Rym: Is that how do you specify in?

306
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,598
Rym: legalese in an unambiguous way what is allowed and what is not?

307
00:19:43,638 --> 00:19:46,555
Rym: because Technologists like I can look at it and say that's neutral.

308
00:19:46,595 --> 00:19:47,520
Rym: That's not that's neutral.

309
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:53,080
Rym: That's not and it's obvious to me and most text would agree with me, but that doesn't really fly in a court of law.

310
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,204
Rym: I mean the whole.

311
00:19:54,665 --> 00:19:55,709
Rym: is it pornography?

312
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:57,816
Rym: Well, I know it when I see it.

313
00:19:58,077 --> 00:19:58,779
Rym: That's BS.

314
00:20:00,423 --> 00:20:02,220
Rym: That does that works even less for technology.

315
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:09,519
Rym: So, how can we fight for net neutrality if we can't define what it truly is on a very specific logical unambiguous level?

316
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:24,520
Scott: Is true in a way But the point is is people need to understand, you know, what exactly like when these issues come up, you know Like you got to really pay attention and you know, think about what's being said and what's going on.

317
00:20:25,022 --> 00:20:30,200
Scott: You know, it's really common sense once you understand even like a little bit what you know.

318
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,440
Scott: The issue the current issue is like what's fair and what's not fair, you know, and what would be okay?

319
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,664
Scott: And what would not be okay?

320
00:20:37,684 --> 00:20:41,860
Scott: It's like is it okay for Google to pay someone to put a server somewhere?

321
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:49,679
Scott: Yeah, is it okay for someone to make Google go faster and to make something else go slower, you know, Yahoo goes slower.

322
00:20:51,403 --> 00:20:53,008
Rym: What's the line between like?

323
00:20:53,028 --> 00:20:56,238
Rym: do you do based on like one layer of ISP versus another layer?

324
00:20:56,258 --> 00:21:01,180
Rym: and what if I Buy a t1 for myself and I sell it to my two neighbors and it's just our little network?

325
00:21:01,702 --> 00:21:04,620
Rym: Am I allowed to discriminate against their stuff even though they're paying me?

326
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:08,528
Scott: It's a tough question exactly.

327
00:21:08,548 --> 00:21:08,789
Scott: I guess.

328
00:21:08,829 --> 00:21:15,260
Scott: if you're a company you can definitely do it and It depends on what your agreement is with your neighbors, but an ISP is just a company.

329
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:24,099
Rym: So all the all the customers who sign up for ISPs the agreement just says yeah, if you use peer-to-peer We'll I would are you I would agree with that.

330
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,147
Scott: Possibly that right.

331
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:27,351
Scott: the problem with that.

332
00:21:27,491 --> 00:21:29,478
Rym: So, you know the problem with that is twofold.

333
00:21:29,518 --> 00:21:32,660
Rym: number one I'll get to a false advertising of the I.

334
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:37,440
Scott: Wait, no, there's the other issue the monopoly of the ISPs.

335
00:21:37,681 --> 00:21:41,235
Scott: you often do not have a choice in broadband ISP.

336
00:21:41,275 --> 00:21:47,714
Scott: if I could choose between FiOS cable vision whatever then maybe it would be okay for them to.

337
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:54,398
Scott: you know start doing shit, but Because I have no other choice You know, that's reasonable, you know, we can't be.

338
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:59,500
Scott: you know It needs to be treated like utility and not treated like that's it because it's not just false advertising.

339
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:05,060
Scott: That's why you know, the phone system is so heavily regulated because in 99% of places you don't have a choice.

340
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,578
Scott: It's you get Verizon because you live here, but it's not just.

341
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:13,560
Rym: I mean Looking at the false advertising perspective Even if it's not technically false advertising.

342
00:22:14,361 --> 00:22:19,260
Rym: The fact is that every ISP basically makes their terms of service say that they can do anything at any time for any reason.

343
00:22:19,783 --> 00:22:21,797
Rym: Yep, but then again, how do we stop that?

344
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,559
Rym: Of course the easy way to stop that is to allow competition in some way.

345
00:22:25,921 --> 00:22:31,097
Scott: I mean our ISP started doing the stupid DNS thing and they also started doing.

346
00:22:31,138 --> 00:22:35,774
Scott: they've always blocked I think port 25 unless you pay for the business thing, but that's all they do.

347
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:37,419
Scott: Otherwise, they're cool for now.

348
00:22:38,062 --> 00:22:43,925
Rym: Yeah, I mean the only reason we haven't had issues is that as far as I can tell none of our neighbors really are internet People.

349
00:22:44,188 --> 00:22:55,720
Scott: no, not really Far more bandwidth and we should be getting yeah, the real the real thing that goes on here right is that You know you the the ISP gets an internet connection from someone else, right?

350
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,870
Scott: They buy an OC 3 let's say right and then they want to sell that to everyone in town.

351
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,926
Scott: now Yeah, let's say the OC 3.

352
00:23:02,926 --> 00:23:06,098
Scott: I don't know how much bandwidth does it have like a hundred two hundred something like that.

353
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:09,230
Scott: a lot Right, but they've got a hundred customers.

354
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:11,138
Scott: They if they give each customer one, right?

355
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,691
Scott: That's only a hundred customers for an OS.

356
00:23:14,013 --> 00:23:18,393
Scott: for one OC 3 That means each customer has to pay hundreds of dollars a month.

357
00:23:18,473 --> 00:23:19,357
Scott: not gonna happen.

358
00:23:19,738 --> 00:23:22,978
Scott: No, no No, and the thing is even if they do that, right?

359
00:23:23,943 --> 00:23:25,886
Scott: They're not gonna use all of the OC 3.

360
00:23:25,886 --> 00:23:33,462
Scott: I mean Every single customer would have to bit tour it full on at the exact same time for the OC 3 to be used up Snake.

361
00:23:33,683 --> 00:23:41,634
Scott: and the way to make money on this right is if you just if you actually have enough bandwidth to Support every customer going full-on all the time.

362
00:23:41,976 --> 00:23:45,187
Scott: You're losing money You're not or your customers are paying way too much.

363
00:23:45,227 --> 00:23:50,187
Rym: See the problem is everyone always advertises unlimited internet with a tiny asterisk Yep.

364
00:23:50,701 --> 00:23:57,489
Scott: So what you have to do is you have to buy a hundred megabits of bandwidth and then sell More than a hundred megabits of bandwidth.

365
00:23:57,509 --> 00:23:57,931
Scott: you to sell.

366
00:23:57,951 --> 00:24:02,112
Scott: it's like a thousand customers giving them ten each But at the same time percent of the time.

367
00:24:02,132 --> 00:24:03,380
Scott: it'll be just fine.

368
00:24:03,446 --> 00:24:10,860
Rym: No but the problem is that as our society is more technological more people are Utilizing the resource that is given to them in the manner that they expect.

369
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:19,423
Scott: But they're not using it a hundred percent and it's economically infeasible to actually be forced to be able to handle a hundred percent Capacity.

370
00:24:19,544 --> 00:24:22,420
Rym: Yes, but at the same time, what do we do when we're basically?

371
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:31,749
Rym: The there's no way to handle this situation because no one is willing to pay what it actually costs and yet at the same time There's the monopolies.

372
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,020
Rym: You don't have any choice regardless.

373
00:24:34,007 --> 00:24:34,372
Rym: What do we do?

374
00:24:36,626 --> 00:24:37,072
Scott: You gotta?

375
00:24:37,113 --> 00:24:52,139
Scott: basically the thing that John C Dvorak is actually kind of right and even though people think he's crazy is that He says there should be metering and not net, you know net neutral metering It's just yo you pay for how much bandwidth you use.

376
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:52,863
Scott: The problem

377
00:24:52,923 --> 00:25:05,472
Rym: is they can't sell metered bandwidth in the US because people are so used to seeing Unlimited with the tiny asterisk that if they see a per hour or per kilobit or whatever charge They're gonna freak out and think it's the days of AOL all over again, but

378
00:25:05,532 --> 00:25:08,020
Scott: the price is reasonable then it's all good.

379
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:13,320
Scott: You know, the thing is this everyone who you know argues against this is always like oh the price is gonna be crazy.

380
00:25:13,421 --> 00:25:16,203
Rym: The thing is the prices are unreasonable I know.

381
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:22,216
Scott: but if the price is reasonable, I would be totally cool with you know Being metered as long as it meant I could.

382
00:25:22,297 --> 00:25:24,800
Scott: you know I could do as much as I want if I do more.

383
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:36,780
Rym: The other issue is I get this impression that if like a cent per megabyte if all the ISPs decided to start Metering they wouldn't like lower their prices and then just meter accordingly to cover the cost.

384
00:25:37,222 --> 00:25:41,540
Rym: They would simply keep their current prices and charge more for anyone who goes above a certain amount.

385
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,886
Scott: Yeah, see that's the thing is like.

386
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:52,365
Scott: it's basically saying yes metering would be cool If you if the person doing the metering was not a dick, but the people who are running this Metering would be cool.

387
00:25:52,405 --> 00:25:57,200
Rym: If the person doing it, even if they are a dick was regulated in some way They don't have to be regulated.

388
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:02,156
Scott: It doesn't mean not a dick charge people to a fair correct price, but of a fraction not a cent.

389
00:26:02,518 --> 00:26:03,260
Rym: That's impossible.

390
00:26:03,524 --> 00:26:06,825
Rym: So we need to regulate it Because there's not impossible.

391
00:26:06,885 --> 00:26:10,276
Rym: it is because the way you still have to have a physical wire.

392
00:26:10,316 --> 00:26:15,174
Scott: go to everyone's house And yes You have a flat fee for the wire and that maintains that wire.

393
00:26:15,194 --> 00:26:27,360
Rym: because the people who maintain the wire Don't they want to have the monopoly people who pay their what they maintain the wire now Yes, the people who actually also sell you the bandwidth in many cases or they lease it from the local like telco.

394
00:26:28,162 --> 00:26:28,464
Scott: It just.

395
00:26:28,524 --> 00:26:32,860
Scott: it needs to be a utility just like phone and electricity and water and then it'll be done.

396
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,544
Rym: Yes, it does.

397
00:26:33,684 --> 00:26:37,163
Rym: if it was treated like utility as opposed to this I mean it is.

398
00:26:37,223 --> 00:26:37,484
Rym: I mean

399
00:26:37,504 --> 00:26:41,540
Scott: I think about every other utility though is metered electricity is metered water is better

400
00:26:41,681 --> 00:26:57,957
Rym: But at the same time there are a lot of laws like for example We get our electricity and our gas but by law Even though the what the pipes and wires that come to our house are owned by one company We have the right to buy our gas and electricity from anyone else out there within.

401
00:26:58,018 --> 00:27:09,266
Rym: there's certain limitation but we can buy it from other people and The people who own the wires to our house are forced by law to accommodate that and they are forced to charge us a certain Minimal regulated amount.

402
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:12,678
Rym: and they can't charge us extra because they have a monopoly on the wire.

403
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,840
Scott: Yeah Well, I mean it's it's possible for people to do this without having the government tell them to but it's never been never happened.

404
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,545
Rym: So we have to have been telling what to do.

405
00:27:20,565 --> 00:27:25,220
Rym: I'm just saying I mean as much as I'm an advocate of deregulation and libertarianism.

406
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,407
Rym: History has shown that deregulation ends in ruin.

407
00:27:28,989 --> 00:27:29,209
Scott: Yeah.

408
00:27:29,871 --> 00:27:34,685
Scott: Oh if we ever get some sort of ymax wireless meshy network We don't need these bastards anymore.

409
00:27:34,746 --> 00:27:38,279
Scott: Anyway, cuz unlike water and electricity we can push it over the sky.

410
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:45,990
Scott: and Even is actually strongly considering, you know Allocating some spectrum to free Internet's even better.

411
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:54,840
Rym: that allows all the crazy things to happen because then Nerds can make mesh networks that are entirely independent of any possible government control or interference.

412
00:27:55,181 --> 00:28:00,440
Scott: Yeah, there's absolutely no way for the government to do any government in any part of the world to do anything about it.

413
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:08,154
Scott: Which means two things well short of technological jamming and you know, all those Aurelian things You know, it would be it would be a war that the government would lose.

414
00:28:08,636 --> 00:28:09,680
Scott: any government would lose.

415
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:15,297
Rym: Well, the government even the Chinese government could win by going one step further and cutting the tall trees.

416
00:28:15,317 --> 00:28:18,225
Scott: I Guess that's the only way that's the only way.

417
00:28:18,706 --> 00:28:20,551
Rym: but but I that happened.

418
00:28:20,571 --> 00:28:27,409
Scott: you don't get a. you would a nerd awesomeness everywhere and be Child porn would be all over the place.

419
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:31,488
Rym: Well, if you got if they had to cut the tall trees situation I think you'd run into the member.

420
00:28:31,528 --> 00:28:37,614
Rym: that article we talked about a long time ago about how Engineers think like terrorists and or terrorists think like engineers.

421
00:28:37,915 --> 00:28:41,529
Rym: Yeah, you don't want to piss Like engineers, it's well.

422
00:28:41,549 --> 00:28:44,020
Rym: now the good terrorists think like engineers.

423
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,212
Scott: Again anyone every engineer right?

424
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:55,425
Scott: I mean look at like this some of the stuff that like What's the Bruce Schneier rice?

425
00:28:55,445 --> 00:28:58,255
Scott: He's like the foremost security expert in the world, right?

426
00:28:58,495 --> 00:28:59,840
Scott: He's like, oh, this is so easy.

427
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,107
Scott: Look how you can get through the airport.

428
00:29:01,147 --> 00:29:02,032
Scott: Look how you can do this.

429
00:29:02,072 --> 00:29:02,856
Scott: Look how you can do that.

430
00:29:02,897 --> 00:29:03,500
Scott: It's so simple.

431
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:09,760
Scott: It's like if I wanted to make a knife on an airplane I would go and get some like iron epoxy at Home Depot and a piece of cardboard.

432
00:29:10,222 --> 00:29:12,915
Scott: Bring it on the plane, you know, I fold the piece of cardboard.

433
00:29:12,955 --> 00:29:14,020
Scott: I put in the iron epoxy.

434
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:15,206
Scott: I hold it there now.

435
00:29:15,246 --> 00:29:16,734
Scott: I have a sharp knife on the plane.

436
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:17,699
Scott: Tada, right?

437
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,734
Scott: Nope engineers think like this and they come up with these things all the time.

438
00:29:21,754 --> 00:29:23,160
Scott: I come up with these things all the time.

439
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:35,858
Scott: It's trivially easy to ruin the world if you have an engineering brain but anyone who is smart enough to think of these things and be an engineer is Not a terrorist because smart people aren't evil That's it.

440
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,221
Scott: There's just.

441
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:36,422
Scott: that's.

442
00:29:36,462 --> 00:29:39,916
Scott: the reason that the world is still in one piece is because no smart people are evil.

443
00:29:39,956 --> 00:29:44,559
Scott: if there was even one Engineer who was an ass and wanted to kill everyone we would all be dead.

444
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:59,874
Rym: Anyway, before we talk too much more about that I'd like to read for you a a quote from an article that this is kind of my news bit and You're gonna feel a lot of righteous indignation, but

445
00:30:00,335 --> 00:30:01,640
Scott: I'm not indignant or fat

446
00:30:02,262 --> 00:30:03,646
Rym: Maybe not you but the rest of you.

447
00:30:03,947 --> 00:30:08,240
Rym: you're gonna feel some sort of bristle perhaps and I'm gonna read the whole thing.

448
00:30:08,561 --> 00:30:09,868
Rym: I'll let you mull over it for a second.

449
00:30:09,888 --> 00:30:12,239
Rym: Then we'll talk about what what actually was going on there.

450
00:30:13,674 --> 00:30:15,583
Rym: quote Mr.

451
00:30:15,663 --> 00:30:23,695
Rym: Starks, I'm sure you strongly believe in what you're doing But I cannot either support your efforts or allow them to happen in my classroom.

452
00:30:24,498 --> 00:30:27,871
Rym: at this point I am not sure what you are doing is legal.

453
00:30:28,654 --> 00:30:33,108
Rym: No software is free and Spreading that misconception is harmful.

454
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:41,680
Rym: This is a world where Windows runs on virtually every computer and Putting on a carnival show for an operating system is not helping these children at all.

455
00:30:42,285 --> 00:30:52,058
Rym: I am sure if you contacted Microsoft They would be more than happy to supply you with copies of an older version of Windows and that way Your computers would actually be of service to those receiving them.

456
00:30:55,302 --> 00:30:59,560
Rym: The story here was basically that you can read the articles.

457
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:09,237
Scott: I don't really want to parrot like explain the whole situation and make sure that you read the article Written by the guy that he wrote sort of after it exploded so you can get the real story.

458
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:20,099
Scott: basically Dude shown off open source teacher who I'm not just any dude He's a dude that like puts together like junky old computers He gives them the people who can't afford computers and he puts Linux on him.

459
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:25,500
Rym: Yes, but uh teacher sees this going on has no understanding of technology.

460
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,472
Scott: She sees like kids in a class with computers right looking at something.

461
00:31:29,492 --> 00:31:32,100
Scott: They're all gathered around obviously up to mischief, right?

462
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,010
Scott: They got some CDs.

463
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:39,272
Scott: they got from some guy Running on computers, you know and the teacher doesn't know anything.

464
00:31:39,293 --> 00:31:41,560
Scott: She's not technologically literate or anything.

465
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,028
Scott: You know, she's a Windows world like 90% of people.

466
00:31:44,109 --> 00:31:57,586
Rym: and of course freaks out and leads to this guy writes an article article gets read by people who then paraphrase article full of righteous indignation gets crazier and crazier and crazier and Makes a little internet explosion.

467
00:31:57,987 --> 00:32:02,384
Rym: and then there's a whole follow-up article where the guy who wrote the article was like, dude Yes, she was wrong.

468
00:32:02,424 --> 00:32:03,307
Rym: And yes, she was dumb.

469
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:07,460
Rym: But seriously you people are overreacting times a million.

470
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:12,720
Scott: Yeah, he like he found out that the school system actually even though they run Windows has like shit tons open-source.

471
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,752
Scott: They got the open office and the Firefox and the whole, you know, it's just.

472
00:32:16,054 --> 00:32:17,500
Scott: there's one teacher who didn't know.

473
00:32:17,941 --> 00:32:20,171
Scott: She saw some kids in her class up to mischief.

474
00:32:20,412 --> 00:32:22,039
Scott: She was not technologically literate.

475
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,945
Scott: So she said some things and you know from her, you know Understanding or whatever.

476
00:32:27,025 --> 00:32:30,416
Scott: and then she learned a lesson that oh my god Linux open source.

477
00:32:30,456 --> 00:32:32,889
Rym: I didn't know but The the point.

478
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:33,191
Rym: I want him.

479
00:32:33,211 --> 00:32:38,132
Rym: I don't want to talk about the article I don't want to talk about the oh my god, the internet overreacted.

480
00:32:38,153 --> 00:32:39,658
Rym: Yeah.

481
00:32:40,320 --> 00:33:03,428
Rym: Oh shit but this brings up a lot of really important issues that we have all as technologists run into and first off the fact that if you're in school and the authority figures that are Responsible for your education appear to know less about the things you know about than you You are not going to respect them.

482
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:25,830
Rym: and one of them one of the biggest problems I've seen Among smart kids especially kids who were smart in technology in schools in public high schools in public middle schools Is that because of the curriculum and because you'll often have teachers who while they are very knowledgeable in their subjects or whatever At the same time they are completely Unknowledgeable in the things that the students are knowledgeable about?

483
00:33:26,513 --> 00:33:37,718
Rym: it's very easy for teachers to lose all Respect and in fact gain the contempt of the best and brightest students in their classes Simply by the fact that on the surface they appear to be completely ignorant and illiterate.

484
00:33:37,758 --> 00:33:38,180
Rym: effectively.

485
00:33:38,682 --> 00:33:42,400
Scott: Yeah, I mean back and that you've always had a problem of students disrespecting teachers.

486
00:33:42,561 --> 00:33:43,264
Scott: This is nothing new.

487
00:33:43,304 --> 00:33:45,494
Scott: and students thinking they're smarter than teachers.

488
00:33:45,534 --> 00:33:46,780
Scott: That is nothing new either, right?

489
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,908
Rym: I'm sure you all think you're smarter than your teachers.

490
00:33:48,928 --> 00:33:49,731
Rym: Yes, I did too.

491
00:33:49,772 --> 00:33:51,740
Rym: The only difference between you and me and that I was right.

492
00:33:53,584 --> 00:34:01,180
Scott: But Nowadays right you have this compounding problem of the kids basically live in a completely separate world.

493
00:34:01,502 --> 00:34:10,159
Scott: Then the teachers do except for the very young teachers, you know It's like these are I mean like in the 50s even in like when I was in school, right me and my teachers.

494
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,226
Scott: We lived in the same world.

495
00:34:12,266 --> 00:34:14,454
Scott: We had you know, it's like we understood.

496
00:34:14,534 --> 00:34:16,320
Scott: everything was sort of an even understanding.

497
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:21,540
Scott: I might have known about more than them in computers, but it's like they knew more about George, Washington.

498
00:34:21,721 --> 00:34:27,440
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, there weren't like this huge gap between the generations, right?

499
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:32,902
Scott: but now there's always a generation gap, but now the generation gap is Ginormous.

500
00:34:32,922 --> 00:34:34,366
Rym: I mean look here's here's an example.

501
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,369
Rym: when I was in high school.

502
00:34:36,051 --> 00:34:38,760
Rym: I watched the Simpsons when it was on TV.

503
00:34:38,981 --> 00:34:40,907
Rym: I watched it as it came out on TV.

504
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:44,359
Rym: All my friends watched it and all my teachers watched it.

505
00:34:44,701 --> 00:34:48,159
Rym: Yeah, so we there like we all knew there was a common shared culture.

506
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:54,319
Rym: But now a kid in high school now, he he watches like a YouTube poop and that is what he is into.

507
00:34:55,143 --> 00:34:57,076
Rym: The teacher doesn't know it doesn't even know what that is.

508
00:34:58,123 --> 00:35:00,419
Rym: Yeah, they wouldn't even understand it if you showed it to him.

509
00:35:00,701 --> 00:35:03,454
Scott: I mean like think about think about this right in the 50s.

510
00:35:03,474 --> 00:35:04,600
Scott: You'd have a problem, right?

511
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,009
Scott: The problem would be kids got a playboy in class, right?

512
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:11,800
Scott: But the teacher understands Playboy magazine, right?

513
00:35:12,771 --> 00:35:13,954
Scott: Understand the student.

514
00:35:13,974 --> 00:35:16,400
Scott: the student understands Playboy magazine.

515
00:35:16,601 --> 00:35:19,037
Scott: They have a common understanding and they and they know shit.

516
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,320
Scott: I better hide this shit from the teacher and shit you in trouble mister, right?

517
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,117
Scott: There was this common understanding even if there was a lack of respect or a generation gap.

518
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:34,353
Scott: nowadays There is actually that it's difficult to communicate because the gap has widened.

519
00:35:34,393 --> 00:35:38,226
Scott: something that has always been a problem is now a Tremendous problem.

520
00:35:38,447 --> 00:35:47,943
Scott: the teacher sees a student like, you know Doesn't understand that Wikipedia is actually kind of good kind of bad kind of not in between, you know I mean like.

521
00:35:47,983 --> 00:35:48,725
Scott: how long was it?

522
00:35:48,765 --> 00:35:54,381
Scott: Like don't cite any websites in your paper because it's not it's like dude It's.

523
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:54,722
Scott: it's.

524
00:35:55,325 --> 00:35:56,831
Scott: that's not how the world works anymore.

525
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:59,060
Scott: Yeah, just cuz it's in a book versus a website.

526
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,089
Scott: There's nothing inherent about the medium that says this is right.

527
00:36:02,129 --> 00:36:02,771
Scott: This is wrong.

528
00:36:02,832 --> 00:36:05,379
Scott: All right, you know, it's just so huge.

529
00:36:06,144 --> 00:36:08,320
Scott: My problems like this will happen now.

530
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,573
Rym: I don't think this is the fact that part of the gap is just the.

531
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:16,284
Rym: the fact that the modern world requires Technological literacy.

532
00:36:16,825 --> 00:36:37,091
Rym: and yet be a lot of teachers and people who are in positions of authority over children Do not have technological literacy and while they can still get about their lives and while they are extremely Knows about fucking history never used a computer.

533
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:47,680
Rym: He knows the Peloponnesian Wars He will go to great lengths of explaining about themistically is in democracy And I'll write you a hundred page book about it on his typewriter.

534
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:49,346
Rym: But maybe you know, he's never.

535
00:36:49,386 --> 00:36:51,655
Rym: he doesn't use a computer and you see this a lot.

536
00:36:51,675 --> 00:36:52,940
Rym: There are teachers that don't use computers.

537
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,344
Rym: They don't really understand them.

538
00:36:54,685 --> 00:36:58,033
Rym: There's that recent South Park or butters was a vampire where mr.

539
00:36:58,074 --> 00:37:01,885
Rym: Garrison's at the front like now click on the Thing.

540
00:37:01,905 --> 00:37:03,720
Scott: Oh, that was the perfect illustration.

541
00:37:03,941 --> 00:37:04,584
Scott: What's going on?

542
00:37:04,685 --> 00:37:06,092
Scott: Every single student's playing like.

543
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:10,628
Scott: so I'm like it was one of those, you know FPS war games like the Call of Duty's or something like one of those.

544
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,607
Scott: Yeah, right and mr.

545
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,459
Scott: Garrison's like.

546
00:37:15,027 --> 00:37:15,272
Scott: No, I know.

547
00:37:16,462 --> 00:37:19,540
Rym: But the student who I mean imagine it.

548
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:26,040
Rym: It's the equivalent of in the 1900s where I'm in school and my teacher is illiterate and yet I know how to read.

549
00:37:26,521 --> 00:37:32,580
Rym: And that is the way someone who's technologically illiterate comes across to a young student in a school.

550
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:39,380
Rym: They see a teacher who has trouble making PowerPoint go and they they look at that teacher as though that teacher is completely illiterate.

551
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:44,253
Scott: Yep So I remember this actually reminds me of some time when I was at RIT.

552
00:37:44,294 --> 00:37:46,020
Scott: I was taking this computer security class.

553
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,040
Scott: It was a pretty cool class, you know with this cool guy.

554
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,139
Scott: I won't get into that now.

555
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:56,142
Scott: But you know there was some time in the class is spent talking about open source and such right and there was a person in The class.

556
00:37:56,182 --> 00:37:59,320
Scott: it was an older woman, you know, she wasn't like a college student age.

557
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,258
Scott: She was someone who went back to college which is totally cool.

558
00:38:01,943 --> 00:38:04,420
Scott: But you know, she didn't really understand the open source.

559
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:10,640
Scott: She was like why why would you make something and then that was so great and then give it away for free?

560
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,845
Scott: You could you could make money.

561
00:38:11,986 --> 00:38:27,520
Scott: I just don't get it Right and I bet at the time what I said was because we're not assholes, right but upon later thinking about it Here's here's the correct answer to this question right of why would you do open source and such, you know?

562
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,950
Scott: Because people just don't understand it and that's one of the fundamental miss.

563
00:38:31,071 --> 00:38:32,335
Scott: it's just misunderstanding.

564
00:38:32,355 --> 00:38:33,237
Scott: this lady had right.

565
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:34,020
Scott: why?

566
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,645
Scott: No, software is free.

567
00:38:35,705 --> 00:38:37,433
Scott: who would possibly create something for free.

568
00:38:37,473 --> 00:38:38,980
Scott: That's that doesn't make any sense, right?

569
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:43,280
Scott: Here's the answer to that question and it ties into what we were just talking about the illiteracy, right?

570
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:48,259
Scott: Okay, we talked about why would you do something if you weren't getting compensated for it?

571
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:58,626
Scott: Well, if you actually saw like a hobbling old lady who is sick, you know, not a homeless lady But just a regular, you know who is you know, sick and crazy And you give her an Ubuntu CD.

572
00:38:58,667 --> 00:39:02,080
Scott: No, no, and she's actually having a problem, you know.

573
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,297
Scott: Let's say an old lady like falls over in the street.

574
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:09,235
Scott: Yeah, are you gonna require conversation to call 9-1-1 and you know help her out and such?

575
00:39:09,315 --> 00:39:10,800
Scott: No, you just do it, right?

576
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:15,437
Scott: Well from a technological person looking at most of the world, right?

577
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,620
Scott: Everyone is old ladies falling over in the street with heart attacks.

578
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,852
Scott: That's how stupid the vast majority people are when it comes technology.

579
00:39:24,174 --> 00:39:28,040
Scott: So open source is Calling 9-1-1 for the old ladies.

580
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:33,377
Scott: We're doing it for free because you were fucking going to die because you understand this shit.

581
00:39:33,397 --> 00:39:35,880
Scott: You're that stupid You're that screwed.

582
00:39:36,467 --> 00:39:44,820
Scott: So the read, you know It's like why could we charge you to call the ambulance and rescue you from your insane technological stupidity?

583
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,939
Scott: I think that's what open source is.

584
00:39:47,020 --> 00:40:06,700
Rym: But there's another factor there with open source the fact that I don't think a lot of people in previous generations other than of course people are hip to technology and Really have understood the fact that in the modern world many hobbies while they're hobbies And they're enjoyable to the people doing them produce valuable fruitful works.

585
00:40:07,285 --> 00:40:14,780
Scott: Yeah, I mean like in the olden days I mean there were a few hobbies that produced few fruitful works like ham radio sort of produced fruitful works.

586
00:40:15,283 --> 00:40:18,220
Scott: And I guess you know some people like photographers and that's produced.

587
00:40:19,144 --> 00:40:20,790
Rym: Some people think of hobbies like.

588
00:40:20,811 --> 00:40:30,728
Rym: they think making a ship in the bottle and that doesn't help anyone Anyone except your mantle, but I guess nowadays like kids today our ship in a bottle is the YouTube poop Which I guess doesn't add anything to society either.

589
00:40:30,748 --> 00:40:30,788
Rym: or.

590
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:45,496
Scott: but some people ship in a bottle is like, you know me foes Which is a software program that allows you know Banks in all sorts of you know poverty stricken places to manage micro load

591
00:40:45,596 --> 00:40:49,876
Rym: or say GeekNights Which provides entertainment to at least dozens of people

592
00:40:49,956 --> 00:40:50,298
Scott: at least

593
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:50,519
Rym: dozens

594
00:40:51,421 --> 00:40:53,350
Scott: Dozens of possible human beings.

595
00:40:53,471 --> 00:40:55,260
Rym: I always like how it's all politics.

596
00:40:55,421 --> 00:41:04,858
Rym: I mean they're very widely listened to but they all whenever they talk about the listener They always refer to the listener, and I hope the listener enjoys the show.

597
00:41:06,601 --> 00:41:07,444
Scott: That's pretty good.

598
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:09,212
Scott: Yeah, I'd steal that if it wasn't stealing.

599
00:41:09,252 --> 00:41:13,426
Rym: Yes like we got a letter from the listener today So they ever named the listener now.

600
00:41:13,626 --> 00:41:14,610
Scott: It's always the same one.

601
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:14,891
Scott: Yes.

602
00:41:15,071 --> 00:41:15,673
Scott: Oh, that's great.

603
00:41:15,693 --> 00:41:16,376
Scott: I like that.

604
00:41:16,978 --> 00:41:17,540
Rym: I like that show.

605
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:19,278
Scott: Let's move on.

606
00:41:26,522 --> 00:41:28,515
Rym: Anyway things of the day.

607
00:41:28,716 --> 00:41:29,260
Rym: was that okay?

608
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,263
Rym: Should I say it that way?

609
00:41:30,303 --> 00:41:34,619
Scott: should I say it to consider ever you want because it's whatever all right check this out.

610
00:41:35,324 --> 00:41:37,420
Scott: MSI which is a motherboard maker mostly.

611
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:42,580
Scott: But they are they're making netbooks now like most people are and they got this one called the MSI wind.

612
00:41:42,922 --> 00:41:44,876
Scott: Pretty popular pretty popular the MSI wind.

613
00:41:44,957 --> 00:41:45,118
Scott: right.

614
00:41:45,761 --> 00:41:51,487
Scott: apparently the MSI wind is Almost exactly identical to a Mac.

615
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:55,580
Scott: You know hardware wise you know it comes running XP or Linux or whatever.

616
00:41:56,364 --> 00:41:59,020
Scott: Right now it was missing something though.

617
00:41:59,522 --> 00:42:02,151
Scott: They didn't have the driver for the wireless.

618
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:12,811
Scott: so if you installed the OXX on it, right You know you just need a little hacked version of OS X and you're good to go, but You didn't need any hardware mods or any firmware updates or anything like that.

619
00:42:12,852 --> 00:42:17,587
Scott: all you needed was a hacked version of the OS X Software on a DVD and you're good to go.

620
00:42:17,627 --> 00:42:21,840
Scott: right the problem was that there was no driver for the wireless, right?

621
00:42:21,961 --> 00:42:25,279
Scott: So you wouldn't be able to do any wireless if you saw the OS X. otherwise it'd be just fine.

622
00:42:26,701 --> 00:42:28,565
Scott: There was a. there was a little leak.

623
00:42:29,187 --> 00:42:34,579
Scott: well will possibly almost guaranteed intentional leak with a wink wink from the MSI people.

624
00:42:35,922 --> 00:42:38,335
Scott: So now you can install OS X and the MSI wind.

625
00:42:38,697 --> 00:42:40,143
Scott: oh snap And that's that's.

626
00:42:40,364 --> 00:42:41,287
Scott: that's my thing of the day.

627
00:42:41,347 --> 00:42:45,220
Scott: cuz that's just so awesome that there was one of those wink wink leaks.

628
00:42:45,723 --> 00:42:49,223
Scott: Yeah, intentionally releasing the Wi-Fi The drivers.

629
00:42:49,243 --> 00:42:57,068
Scott: you know I can install OS X on a non Mac because the thing is having OS X for like a TV PC plus.

630
00:42:57,088 --> 00:42:59,720
Scott: you're not gonna be paying for this copy OS X. you're gonna get a hacked one.

631
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:06,720
Rym: Yeah, but like right now we have we have the oldest slowest like the very first Mac mini like the first one.

632
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,887
Scott: Oh, we have the very first Intel one.

633
00:43:09,309 --> 00:43:11,356
Rym: I'm going to consider that the very first Mac.

634
00:43:11,376 --> 00:43:19,552
Rym: There was a g4 one Yes, but that does not count right, but anyway It's old and slow, but for being a TV PC.

635
00:43:19,692 --> 00:43:20,594
Rym: It's fantastic.

636
00:43:20,655 --> 00:43:21,517
Scott: That's okay.

637
00:43:21,938 --> 00:43:30,888
Scott: It's not perfect No, it's not, but while we lose a few things like easy emulation It'd be better if you had an HD TV would be better but that is that's true for any plugged into the.

638
00:43:31,249 --> 00:43:39,380
Rym: I could perhaps foresee buying one of these motherboards and taking the OS X we have hacking it and Putting it on the second TV in the house.

639
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,915
Scott: Oh, you would need the newer OS X the one that we don't have.

640
00:43:42,157 --> 00:43:45,379
Scott: ah crap Yeah, because you have the tiger we would need the leopard which is one newer.

641
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:52,399
Scott: Yeah, I would actually consider, you know, if we had a new house and whatever, you know first we need to get newer TV.

642
00:43:52,721 --> 00:43:55,072
Rym: God, yes, but I'll be I'm done with CRT.

643
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:58,900
Scott: CRT's belong in basements Yeah, but they belong in the trash.

644
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:12,988
Scott: But anyway after we're after we're done with that I could foresee eventually buying like, you know If they ever come out with a newer Mac mini we just get like the newer better one that way like, you know Wouldn't have trouble like Decoding videos sometimes

645
00:44:13,028 --> 00:44:18,369
Rym: because the the benefits of having like Linux or building it ourselves are somewhat mitigated by the fact that

646
00:44:18,509 --> 00:44:20,216
Scott: you get that little remote control

647
00:44:20,236 --> 00:44:23,003
Rym: and the fact that the 99%

648
00:44:23,003 --> 00:44:25,051
Scott: of the time all you want to do is watch a video.

649
00:44:25,071 --> 00:44:28,208
Scott: and even though we can't run an emulator on it very easily Who cares?

650
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:29,139
Rym: plus this the guys?

651
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,056
Rym: The fact that that thing is a tiny silent box.

652
00:44:33,096 --> 00:44:33,800
Scott: Yeah a lot.

653
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:40,520
Scott: It's like I could go and build the most amazing like, you know Home theater PC HD PC, but it would be loud.

654
00:44:41,223 --> 00:44:47,178
Rym: Yeah, even if you like you water cool like you went the craziness it still have that little And it's big.

655
00:44:48,422 --> 00:45:00,059
Scott: So the smallness and the quietness and the limited functionality of the Mac Mini is worth it because it still achieves 99% of the functionality we want even though it's not a hundred percent.

656
00:45:00,399 --> 00:45:04,758
Scott: and It you know that quietness and smallness outweighs the lack of functionality.

657
00:45:04,778 --> 00:45:09,820
Rym: So so I'm going to teach you all a word and I hope that you will start using.

658
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,794
Scott: I think we've discussed this on GeekNights before we may have.

659
00:45:12,814 --> 00:45:15,727
Rym: it might have been a long time ago And there's definitely a wicked long time.

660
00:45:15,747 --> 00:45:16,711
Scott: It was pretty interesting.

661
00:45:16,751 --> 00:45:20,780
Rym: But just so you all are aware I'd forgotten about this word.

662
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:28,492
Rym: But today I was setting up some Apache stuff at work and I had a reference because I don't have all the Apache Directives and things memorized.

663
00:45:28,774 --> 00:45:29,258
Scott: No one does.

664
00:45:29,318 --> 00:45:32,166
Rym: I was Maybe one person does.

665
00:45:32,186 --> 00:45:34,013
Rym: no, there's something.

666
00:45:34,033 --> 00:45:35,960
Rym: there's got to be some guy whose whole life is a patch.

667
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,865
Rym: He's like the Rain Man.

668
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:39,780
Scott: No, even though even like the Apache Foundation people don't fucking know.

669
00:45:39,921 --> 00:45:42,353
Rym: No, not those people, but there's got to be an Apache Rain Man.

670
00:45:42,675 --> 00:45:42,997
Scott: I don't know.

671
00:45:43,258 --> 00:45:52,019
Rym: anyway long story short One way to refer to the hash sign or the pound sign is the Octo Thorpe.

672
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,926
Scott: Yep See I knew there was a word.

673
00:45:54,026 --> 00:45:57,701
Scott: Octo Thorpe and Rym said it and I go I've heard that word and then it say he's Like.

674
00:45:57,781 --> 00:45:58,585
Scott: oh, it's the pound sign.

675
00:45:58,605 --> 00:46:03,156
Scott: I'm like, oh I knew that it's like, you know hate it when you know something But you can't recall it at the moment.

676
00:46:03,196 --> 00:46:03,459
Scott: It's like.

677
00:46:04,284 --> 00:46:07,579
Scott: You knew it, but you couldn't come up with a pointer in the leaves.

678
00:46:07,881 --> 00:46:08,282
Rym: You know it.

679
00:46:08,382 --> 00:46:12,115
Rym: the pointer in the relational database that is your brain is pointing that like it's.

680
00:46:12,175 --> 00:46:15,586
Rym: there's a pointer pointing at it But you can't find that pointer.

681
00:46:15,867 --> 00:46:21,182
Rym: you find all these other pointers that get close, but there's like a link missing and You know.

682
00:46:21,222 --> 00:46:27,024
Rym: that happens when you're trying to remember something and like you're thinking like, you know, you know it but you don't know What's the word.

683
00:46:27,044 --> 00:46:32,905
Scott: and then as soon as you're reminded suddenly you're like, oh I did know that but there's no way to prove You're like you could be lying.

684
00:46:33,026 --> 00:46:33,708
Scott: Dr.

685
00:46:33,848 --> 00:46:35,132
Rym: Pachto Octo Thorpe.

686
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:44,935
Rym: like it comes suddenly when you get to the right pointer, but yeah This is an article talking about the etymology of the word Octo Thorpe and all the different theories of where it really came from.

687
00:46:44,955 --> 00:46:48,044
Rym: if you're a tech or You listen to GeekNights.

688
00:46:48,064 --> 00:46:51,899
Rym: They're the kind of person who would like to have an affected way of saying Octo Thorpe.

689
00:46:52,884 --> 00:46:55,780
Rym: To give a little quote just you you know, see where this article is going.

690
00:46:56,844 --> 00:47:08,209
Rym: He says that it was a joke term originally Octo Thorpe Invented by two friends John C Shaq and Hubert T Outhlaut Who deliberately included the th sound.

691
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:17,000
Rym: knowing that it would be difficult for speakers of certain languages to say No, they then went on to quietly introduce it into various documents until it was too late to retract it.

692
00:47:18,061 --> 00:47:18,923
Scott: Let's see about that.

693
00:47:19,224 --> 00:47:23,616
Rym: Yeah, the articles fun and hopefully we'll get some affectations going here.

694
00:47:23,937 --> 00:47:32,197
Scott: affectations are good All right, so today we decided we were having a hard time coming to the tech topic But I thought it might be interesting to talk about.

695
00:47:32,297 --> 00:47:37,380
Scott: you know The the ebooks the e-paper ebook readers that sort of thing, right?

696
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:44,853
Rym: Especially because today I carried a very heavy and large book to work and then home from work And I didn't even have my bag.

697
00:47:44,873 --> 00:47:50,413
Rym: and let me tell you I'm getting real sick of carrying gigantic books around and then spilling things on.

698
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:56,680
Scott: I think my strategy right now is I'm not gonna buy any more Non comic books that are on dead tree, right?

699
00:47:57,221 --> 00:48:17,660
Scott: And then when I finish all the ones I've got that are on dead tree Then I will go and buy the Kindle 2 or whatever it is and then go for that because you know what my one of the Major things I've been had about the Kindle that I don't like is that the selection is not as strong as it is with the dead Tree, right, you know you can get any book on dead tree, but you can't get any book on Kindle.

700
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:18,243
Scott: But you know what.

701
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:21,900
Scott: you can get enough books on Kindle more than you're gonna read in your whole life.

702
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:22,950
Scott: So does it really matter?

703
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:24,040
Scott: does it really?

704
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,065
Scott: So I think that's my plan.

705
00:48:26,145 --> 00:48:28,033
Scott: But even though that's my plan.

706
00:48:28,053 --> 00:48:35,316
Scott: It's not everyone's plan and I think people, you know, they have a hard time, you know sort of understanding.

707
00:48:35,396 --> 00:48:39,389
Scott: what sort of holding Ebooks back what's holding e-paper back?

708
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:40,735
Scott: Why is the Kindle the way it is?

709
00:48:40,836 --> 00:48:41,880
Scott: Why isn't it there yet?

710
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:44,589
Scott: You know, why is all this other technology like crazy?

711
00:48:44,609 --> 00:48:47,620
Scott: Why can we do a 3d game, but we can't do a freaking ebook?

712
00:48:47,741 --> 00:48:48,651
Scott: It should be the simplest thing.

713
00:48:48,711 --> 00:48:49,499
Scott: It's just text, right?

714
00:48:50,603 --> 00:48:53,542
Rym: Well, the short answer is displays Batteries.

715
00:48:53,803 --> 00:48:56,460
Scott: Yeah, the RN let let's talk about the displays, right?

716
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:03,680
Scott: Unlike, you know your LCD screen on your computer an e-book reader has, you know different needs, right?

717
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:07,133
Scott: I mean, it's only displaying text hopefully and only.

718
00:49:07,193 --> 00:49:10,932
Scott: you know, we'd like to get more colors But right now we can't even get black and white.

719
00:49:10,992 --> 00:49:12,180
Scott: So let's just stick with that for now.

720
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,350
Rym: Yeah, well, I mean in the long run what like?

721
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:23,120
Rym: I'm reading this book on advanced skiing techniques And it consists half of text and half of pictures of guys doing the ski techniques and showing how to do them.

722
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,634
Scott: Yeah, so that really wouldn't work out on the Kindle.

723
00:49:25,674 --> 00:49:26,720
Rym: Yeah, no Kindle for that.

724
00:49:26,981 --> 00:49:29,469
Scott: But you know for most books like a sci-fi novel.

725
00:49:29,529 --> 00:49:29,870
Scott: it's not.

726
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:34,607
Scott: it's just text right and even if there's a few illustrations They're mostly black and white.

727
00:49:34,647 --> 00:49:35,250
Scott: Anyway, it's a pain.

728
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:36,878
Scott: It's a you know, mass-market trade paperback.

729
00:49:36,918 --> 00:49:39,810
Scott: You're all good Right and you could do those right?

730
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:45,972
Scott: So you it's not anyway, but In the long run new on color right now black and white.

731
00:49:46,494 --> 00:49:48,160
Scott: why can't we make a black and white screen?

732
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:48,521
Scott: That's good.

733
00:49:48,581 --> 00:49:49,123
Scott: Number one.

734
00:49:49,465 --> 00:49:52,115
Scott: We need to make a screen that doesn't hurt.

735
00:49:52,135 --> 00:49:55,679
Scott: when you look at it for a long time You look at a book for a long time.

736
00:49:56,101 --> 00:49:59,276
Scott: If you look at an even a good LCD look at it for a long time.

737
00:49:59,677 --> 00:50:05,274
Scott: It's bright It's shining light at you and it you get some eye strains, you know, it's.

738
00:50:05,735 --> 00:50:07,320
Rym: it's tricky business because you want to.

739
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:22,420
Rym: One philosophy is to emulate as much as possible what actual printed paper looks like because you have been reading that for a long time and I think that's the best way to Go right now because it'll if we perfect that we'll get to an acceptable point.

740
00:50:22,521 --> 00:50:32,745
Rym: but at the same time We really need to go beyond that because the printed paper while it's great for a lot of things at the same time It does have its limitations Can't read in the dark.

741
00:50:33,127 --> 00:50:36,280
Scott: Yeah, I was just gonna say all right, you can't read printed paper in the dark.

742
00:50:36,641 --> 00:50:42,860
Scott: Well, okay, so we don't need the light behind the screen anymore because you can't read the Kindle in the dark either.

743
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,500
Scott: We'll make it sort of like the original GBA screen where the light came from outside and bounced off.

744
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,236
Rym: But now do you want to have a book light on your Kindle?

745
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:52,713
Scott: Yeah I mean seriously a book light on the Kindle.

746
00:50:52,773 --> 00:50:53,640
Scott: Is that really necessary?

747
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,715
Scott: You could have a switch that turns on a light behind the screen.

748
00:50:57,017 --> 00:50:59,548
Scott: that could work But even then that drains the batteries.

749
00:50:59,609 --> 00:51:00,211
Scott: no light.

750
00:51:00,231 --> 00:51:02,139
Rym: be also light behind the screen.

751
00:51:02,644 --> 00:51:07,797
Rym: Lightning the light The background behind the text is going to increase the eye string.

752
00:51:07,817 --> 00:51:09,640
Rym: cuz now again You've got this direct.

753
00:51:09,781 --> 00:51:12,035
Scott: Well, it can be like the ever see those Timex watches.

754
00:51:12,096 --> 00:51:12,760
Scott: you push the button.

755
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,068
Scott: It sort of has this greenish light.

756
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:20,220
Rym: that doesn't you know, it's pretty cool You do something like that, but at the same time that color might be really fatiguing in the long run.

757
00:51:20,341 --> 00:51:20,782
Scott: It could be.

758
00:51:21,003 --> 00:51:23,755
Scott: it really you gotta really you got to figure these things out that I.

759
00:51:23,836 --> 00:51:31,080
Rym: this is a part where we need to Do a lot of like just research of you know testing humans and looking at their physiological reactions to reading things.

760
00:51:31,301 --> 00:51:35,913
Scott: So LCD screens right as we have them for our computers and TVs and whatnot.

761
00:51:36,214 --> 00:51:38,600
Scott: and plasmas also use too much electricity.

762
00:51:38,964 --> 00:51:42,428
Scott: they're too bright and You know, they're actually too thick.

763
00:51:42,488 --> 00:51:43,392
Scott: I mean an e-book.

764
00:51:43,452 --> 00:51:44,738
Scott: readers got to be small or else.

765
00:51:44,778 --> 00:51:45,220
Scott: What's the point?

766
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:49,880
Scott: I might as well carry the freaking book, you know, it's got to be small and light and last a long time.

767
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,033
Scott: Otherwise, I'm just gonna take the book with me.

768
00:51:52,053 --> 00:51:53,260
Scott: There's no point right plus.

769
00:51:53,421 --> 00:51:54,528
Scott: I also got to be cheap.

770
00:51:55,132 --> 00:51:56,139
Rym: and I mean look at the display.

771
00:51:56,862 --> 00:52:01,300
Rym: Part of the problem with LCDs and the technology we have is that they constantly have to be refreshed.

772
00:52:01,661 --> 00:52:08,480
Rym: There's a refresh rate and unless your refresh rate is super high, even if you can't physically see it It causes eye strain eventually.

773
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:14,380
Scott: Yeah I mean look your computer monitor most likely is completely redrawing itself as in blank.

774
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:21,080
Scott: Draw everything again like 75 times a second, you know, it's it's constantly redrawing itself, right?

775
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,413
Scott: And that's you know, that's not when you talk about like FPS in games.

776
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:25,980
Scott: You think about vertical sync, right?

777
00:52:26,261 --> 00:52:30,854
Scott: So it's like if you have a you're playing counter-strike and your monitor is 75 Hertz.

778
00:52:31,034 --> 00:52:33,000
Scott: it redraws itself 75 times a second.

779
00:52:33,662 --> 00:52:36,349
Scott: What's the point of having counter-strike do 100 FPS?

780
00:52:36,369 --> 00:52:37,894
Scott: You're only seeing 75 of them.

781
00:52:38,315 --> 00:52:46,460
Scott: So vertical sync says hey counter-strike Yeah, just make 75 FPS and I'll see all the 75 and it'll be locked in, you know, and it'll be totally cool.

782
00:52:46,781 --> 00:52:47,684
Scott: That's a vertical sync.

783
00:52:47,784 --> 00:53:03,590
Scott: is now if I'm reading a book if you refresh the screen at all Even if it's really fast, right number one that's using electricity to you know redraw and I'm usually looking at one Unmoving thing for a long time a page.

784
00:53:03,992 --> 00:53:06,140
Scott: It's not like a game where it's moving all over the place.

785
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:09,463
Rym: It's actually a page of text very specifically because this is you know It's.

786
00:53:09,564 --> 00:53:10,840
Rym: not only is it one unmoving thing?

787
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:17,431
Rym: But the biggest deal-breaker in the world for me and I feel like this Even if people haven't thought of it is the biggest deal-breaker for anyone.

788
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:21,264
Rym: there can't be any scrolling No, right or up down.

789
00:53:21,344 --> 00:53:28,382
Rym: scrolling as opposed to page flipping is perhaps because even if people like especially people who are used to Reading books.

790
00:53:28,724 --> 00:53:32,619
Rym: I feel like they're like I can read long documents on my monitor because I'm kind of used to it.

791
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,463
Rym: But if you're not used to that Have it.

792
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:39,900
Rym: scrolling and having text move and your eyes following it is gonna tire you out so quick.

793
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,152
Scott: Yeah, most of the things just flip pages, you know, they don't really.

794
00:53:43,534 --> 00:53:50,880
Rym: I've never seen an e-book reader with scrolling But I see people having to zoom in and scroll just because or zoom in and then flip pages more often.

795
00:53:51,302 --> 00:53:55,520
Rym: But that's just the side effect that a lot of people's eyes are really bad and they can't read the smaller fonts.

796
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:56,745
Scott: Yeah, handling fonts.

797
00:53:56,785 --> 00:53:57,950
Scott: That's a software issue though.

798
00:53:57,970 --> 00:53:59,055
Scott: That's not the hardware issue.

799
00:53:59,115 --> 00:54:00,160
Scott: Yeah, but it is an issue.

800
00:54:00,574 --> 00:54:06,496
Rym: Yep And but the display has to be high enough resolution to support a reasonable amount of text on page.

801
00:54:06,536 --> 00:54:07,800
Rym: also big enough size to where?

802
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:13,722
Rym: I can turn the pages at a reasonable pace without scrolling or without having to turn the page constantly That's true.

803
00:54:13,742 --> 00:54:18,518
Scott: If you have insufficient resolution, you know, you're gonna have to either move the text around or something.

804
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:24,860
Rym: It's also insufficient resolution means less capability for anti aliasing and all those things that make you look good.

805
00:54:25,021 --> 00:54:27,820
Scott: Yeah, better looking fonts makes it a lot easier to read.

806
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,085
Scott: I mean you ever look at like.

807
00:54:29,105 --> 00:54:35,914
Scott: I mean, I'm not gonna lie here right you look at a computer running OS X. Right, all the fonts look really great and all like.

808
00:54:35,934 --> 00:54:37,200
Scott: the windows are really smooth.

809
00:54:38,101 --> 00:54:40,373
Scott: It's not anything the Mac does in the hardware.

810
00:54:40,393 --> 00:54:41,820
Scott: It's just got the same Nvidia chips.

811
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,743
Scott: Everything else has.

812
00:54:42,963 --> 00:54:44,548
Scott: it's not anything special at the monitor.

813
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:46,494
Scott: They're just LCD monitors, right?

814
00:54:46,975 --> 00:54:49,422
Scott: It's the rendering algorithms They use.

815
00:54:49,823 --> 00:54:50,044
Scott: right.

816
00:54:50,525 --> 00:54:55,740
Scott: everything you see in OS X is actually based on postscript or PDF or something similar to that.

817
00:54:55,841 --> 00:55:02,620
Scott: you know the rendering system and Steve Jobs is always super anal about font rendering and all that shit and that's why everything's super smooth.

818
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:15,075
Scott: If you VNC to a Mac and on your PC everything in the Mac window will be super smooth All right, so and it makes you know, there's no lie It makes things a lot easier to read and it's a lot more comfortable.

819
00:55:15,135 --> 00:55:18,368
Scott: and it does make you know Good typography makes a significant difference.

820
00:55:18,669 --> 00:55:27,135
Scott: So you need a high resolution screen to get that on the e-book You know to to really make it a much more enjoyable thing and not have you go.

821
00:55:27,196 --> 00:55:27,657
Scott: I fuck this.

822
00:55:27,677 --> 00:55:35,100
Scott: I'm reading a paper book All right, so we got a. you know, you got to have a screen that when you push the button right now.

823
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,520
Scott: I just said we don't want the refresh rate, right?

824
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:41,797
Scott: We want the screen to not refresh right when you're just looking at one page.

825
00:55:42,179 --> 00:55:49,320
Scott: that way it doesn't use any battery when you're looking at one page not doing anything and You're not gonna hurt your eyes because the screens redrawing itself.

826
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:54,080
Scott: But when I push the button to go to next page the next page has to be there instantly.

827
00:55:54,682 --> 00:55:56,589
Scott: So it's like you need a really quick redrawing.

828
00:55:56,669 --> 00:55:59,760
Scott: Otherwise the page would be like I'm turning the page.

829
00:56:01,142 --> 00:56:04,960
Scott: Okay, you know you need to have it like click new page immediately.

830
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:09,736
Scott: So it's gonna have a quick refresh but has to not do it unless you push the button.

831
00:56:10,217 --> 00:56:11,060
Scott: That's very very tricky.

832
00:56:11,283 --> 00:56:12,560
Scott: We can't seem to manage that now.

833
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:19,918
Rym: Of course in terms of just other hardware and this is tied into the display because a lot of display technology either uses a lot of power or sucks.

834
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,545
Rym: Batteries also still suck.

835
00:56:23,166 --> 00:56:28,020
Rym: Yes things gotta last an entire transatlantic flight without me having to swap batteries.

836
00:56:28,421 --> 00:56:34,905
Scott: Exactly, I mean even swap or recharge or anything like that, you know, I mean Basically, I don't want to.

837
00:56:34,985 --> 00:56:38,380
Scott: you know, if they want this is like there's a power outage, right?

838
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:44,635
Scott: I can read a book with like a candle or some shit, right but My Kindle runs out of batteries in the power outage.

839
00:56:45,097 --> 00:56:45,640
Scott: It's not good.

840
00:56:47,763 --> 00:57:02,877
Scott: Now I'm bookless so The battery's got to last a long time and as you know people, you know There's always advances in battery technology getting more electricity per battery and less less weight in the battery and and all this stuff less expensive.

841
00:57:02,938 --> 00:57:06,593
Scott: but People seem to forget and you know Rym points aside all the time.

842
00:57:06,634 --> 00:57:09,260
Rym: to is one of my favorite things to point out But I'll let you do it this time.

843
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,206
Scott: Yeah, is that a battery?

844
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:13,433
Scott: is energy in a brick basically?

845
00:57:13,453 --> 00:57:15,520
Scott: or energy in a tube or something like that?

846
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:16,980
Rym: It's a controlled hand grenade.

847
00:57:17,181 --> 00:57:22,460
Scott: Yes, if you want a battery that lasts longer laws of physics get in your way.

848
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,262
Scott: You have to.

849
00:57:23,282 --> 00:57:27,533
Scott: you have to put more energy in a smaller space.

850
00:57:27,573 --> 00:57:31,561
Scott: if you want it to be lighter and last longer and Etc.

851
00:57:31,762 --> 00:57:33,827
Scott: You're gonna need to be more energy and less space.

852
00:57:34,168 --> 00:57:37,277
Scott: more energy and less space means explode II right?

853
00:57:37,417 --> 00:57:38,520
Scott: There's no way around this.

854
00:57:38,581 --> 00:57:39,519
Scott: It's the laws of physics.

855
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:47,685
Scott: There's no way you can put a whole shit ton of energy in a very small space then, you know and not have it be dangerous It's gonna have.

856
00:57:47,765 --> 00:57:51,960
Scott: it's no way around that and in a lot of ways that is holding us back.

857
00:57:52,061 --> 00:57:56,505
Scott: There are in existence Batteries that are really freaking great.

858
00:57:56,826 --> 00:57:58,810
Scott: They're just fucking really dangerous.

859
00:57:58,871 --> 00:58:00,595
Scott: And that's why you don't have them in your laptop.

860
00:58:00,615 --> 00:58:04,191
Rym: I Don't I'd be willing to accept.

861
00:58:04,333 --> 00:58:08,412
Rym: actually personally I'm willing to accept the danger and even the way.

862
00:58:08,472 --> 00:58:12,329
Scott: the danger isn't even like you Gonna hurt yourself with the mean.

863
00:58:12,349 --> 00:58:16,866
Scott: we're already having problems like cell phone setting on fire Turns it into a bomb.

864
00:58:16,966 --> 00:58:20,500
Scott: right that there's no danger to just if you use it normally and appropriately.

865
00:58:20,982 --> 00:58:28,460
Scott: The danger is only if you're stupid or if you buy a poorly made Chinese junk battery and it sets on fire at the gas station.

866
00:58:28,962 --> 00:58:30,165
Scott: There's no danger in.

867
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:39,895
Scott: you know, a well-made battery being used normally at all No, but you know, even if you put a lot of energy in there I guess too much energy could be a problem, but we could work that out.

868
00:58:39,935 --> 00:58:40,900
Scott: That's a solvable problem.

869
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:54,580
Rym: even more I'm getting the point where size matters to me more than weight and I would actually be willing to accept a Very much more heavy small laptop or a very much more heavy Kindle If the battery just lasted twice as long.

870
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,610
Rym: like add a couple pounds to it, but make it dense.

871
00:58:57,091 --> 00:58:58,135
Scott: Yeah, just if it's.

872
00:58:58,255 --> 00:58:58,536
Scott: if it's.

873
00:58:58,576 --> 00:58:59,399
Scott: you know, it doesn't.

874
00:58:59,419 --> 00:59:01,767
Scott: I mean I already I put two batteries in my laptop.

875
00:59:01,787 --> 00:59:02,550
Scott: that ain't significant.

876
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:04,080
Scott: That's pretty much all the weight.

877
00:59:04,402 --> 00:59:07,878
Scott: if I take both batteries out It weighs almost nothing like like.

878
00:59:08,019 --> 00:59:10,850
Scott: it weighs like maybe the weight of two pieces of paper.

879
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:11,575
Scott: It's that light.

880
00:59:11,836 --> 00:59:13,185
Scott: the batteries are all the weight.

881
00:59:13,648 --> 00:59:21,030
Scott: So Really if I'm putting two batteries if I'm putting two batteries in it, I'll put two heavier batteries in it.

882
00:59:21,352 --> 00:59:25,376
Scott: It's still the same size You know, it's not any bigger.

883
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:31,896
Scott: It's just more battery life and like an extra pound or two, whatever It's not gonna hurt my shoulder.

884
00:59:32,158 --> 00:59:33,143
Scott: It's already light enough.

885
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:34,128
Scott: big big deal.

886
00:59:34,148 --> 00:59:34,610
Scott: Go for it.

887
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:39,766
Scott: No, actually, I guess like 10 pounds would bother me or five but not one.

888
00:59:39,927 --> 00:59:40,870
Rym: but it would be like Dragon Ball.

889
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:42,395
Rym: It trains you it makes you strong.

890
00:59:42,897 --> 00:59:44,402
Scott: Oh, yes my shoulder great.

891
00:59:44,502 --> 00:59:46,188
Rym: Yeah, you'll have one big beefy shoulder.

892
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:49,629
Scott: Yeah But I was a big beefy lap.

893
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:57,754
Rym: I guess the third point like in terms of DRM honestly that is not as much of a concern to me as you'd think because a Lot of the things I want to read.

894
00:59:57,835 --> 01:00:07,341
Rym: one of the reasons I want a device like this is that more and more there are long textual things Online that are free that I want to read at my leisure.

895
01:00:07,421 --> 01:00:11,775
Rym: Yeah, like project Gutenberg, but I don't want to read them On my monitor.

896
01:00:11,856 --> 01:00:18,950
Scott: Yeah project Gutenberg has like all these files I want to read but to read them on my monitor is painful, especially when they're too long.

897
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:19,594
Scott: I mean or plus.

898
01:00:19,634 --> 01:00:20,621
Rym: I want to read them on the trains.

899
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:22,030
Rym: All right, I copy them to my laptop.

900
01:00:22,171 --> 01:00:24,320
Rym: I got all these text files on my laptop.

901
01:00:24,461 --> 01:00:31,470
Scott: I got to remember my spot, you know Even if I have a program that's made to help me read project Gutenberg files, you know.

902
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:34,264
Scott: And I turned down the brightness on the monitor and I'll adjust all that.

903
01:00:34,565 --> 01:00:35,570
Scott: It's still not good enough.

904
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:38,990
Scott: I still have to scroll, you know, it's just it's not gonna work out.

905
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:48,172
Rym: But honestly, I'm willing to think it's too much money and I'm willing to pay what I pay for a paperback book for a DRM DB book.

906
01:00:48,293 --> 01:00:49,635
Scott: see that's just the thing right?

907
01:00:49,715 --> 01:01:00,930
Scott: It's weird because it's like I'm not willing to pay for Music, even though the digital music is cheap and DRM free but somehow I'm willing to pay for the digital book.

908
01:01:01,452 --> 01:01:01,974
Rym: You know why.

909
01:01:01,994 --> 01:01:06,130
Rym: what a reason I think is that with music they still haven't done what I want them to do.

910
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:07,715
Rym: Which is the you want?

911
01:01:07,996 --> 01:01:12,050
Rym: every song the Beatles ever did organized hundred bucks fifty bucks.

912
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:14,306
Scott: Yeah, I think I think that's really what it is.

913
01:01:14,387 --> 01:01:19,502
Scott: Is that Everything I buy in some way, you know, that's that's like media.

914
01:01:19,722 --> 01:01:21,206
Scott: right is a lot.

915
01:01:21,266 --> 01:01:26,321
Scott: for a little I buy a DVD Box set 30 bucks all of cowboy bebop, right?

916
01:01:26,361 --> 01:01:29,230
Scott: I don't buy like some single DVD junk anymore, right?

917
01:01:30,052 --> 01:01:32,721
Scott: Very rarely, I guess once in a blue moon, right?

918
01:01:32,741 --> 01:01:37,898
Scott: I don't buy no, you know, like Comic book for four dollars.

919
01:01:38,019 --> 01:01:40,170
Scott: I buy like, you know the omnibus.

920
01:01:40,391 --> 01:01:47,270
Scott: It's like 20 bucks for like 30 comics, you know, and that's that's the way to get money for stuff these days.

921
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:49,597
Scott: So music they're not selling.

922
01:01:50,038 --> 01:01:58,542
Scott: every song Beatles have ever done with the correct id3 tags in high quality For 20 bucks, they're selling one song for a dollar.

923
01:01:58,702 --> 01:02:00,829
Rym: It's not even just that even if it's DRM free.

924
01:02:00,869 --> 01:02:01,310
Scott: fuck that.

925
01:02:01,632 --> 01:02:04,185
Rym: It's not even just the deal the Scott Johnson syndrome.

926
01:02:04,949 --> 01:02:09,125
Rym: for me It's very simply the metadata is worth more to me than the data.

927
01:02:09,446 --> 01:02:10,550
Rym: I can get the data for free.

928
01:02:10,751 --> 01:02:13,204
Rym: I can pirate anything I want from anywhere at any time.

929
01:02:13,486 --> 01:02:14,290
Rym: That's not the concern.

930
01:02:14,512 --> 01:02:16,429
Rym: It's trivial for me to get any music I want.

931
01:02:17,312 --> 01:02:20,990
Rym: What I want is the metadata and I'm willing to pay a lot for the metadata.

932
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:21,411
Scott: Yeah, why?

933
01:02:21,451 --> 01:02:28,490
Scott: if the music is organized and is high quality and I don't have to sit there sorting it that's worth money.

934
01:02:28,631 --> 01:02:37,266
Scott: I have so many unsorted mp3s and actually the fact that they are so disorganized is Preventing me from listening to a lot of download torrents.

935
01:02:37,287 --> 01:02:46,022
Rym: like a while ago I downloaded a torrent of every rom Stein song ever including like Thousands of bootleg recordings from live concerts.

936
01:02:46,122 --> 01:02:52,610
Rym: Yep, and you know what it is Practically useless to me in the form that I have it because it's so unorganized.

937
01:02:52,731 --> 01:03:02,210
Rym: You can't figure out what to listen to what's what or even if it is organized It's always organized differently and in to make it conform to the way I already organized my music is impossible.

938
01:03:02,461 --> 01:03:09,762
Scott: Yeah It's like this guy organizes his stuff by genre artist album and this guy Organizes by just artist album no genre.

939
01:03:09,782 --> 01:03:18,090
Scott: and this guy does like, you know Just albums and this guy does like, you know by year and then by album.

940
01:03:18,612 --> 01:03:22,242
Rym: This way even though I don't like iTunes very much.

941
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:29,040
Rym: Like I really don't like it just in general if Whoever offers what I want first will get my money.

942
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:31,770
Rym: if Apple was like, hey, we're doing this now.

943
01:03:32,131 --> 01:03:36,928
Rym: You want every rock mononoff piano concerto ever performed by like these five people.

944
01:03:36,968 --> 01:03:37,470
Rym: hundred bucks.

945
01:03:38,274 --> 01:03:41,110
Rym: I will probably give more money to Apple than you could possibly.

946
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:53,341
Scott: I mean if someone actually did this I would pretty much sit for like an hour making a list of all the artists That I wanted and then go buy the complete collection of every single artist Even if it was like two thousand dollars or something like that.

947
01:03:53,662 --> 01:03:54,124
Scott: and I'd be like.

948
01:03:54,165 --> 01:03:55,109
Scott: and then I delete every mp3.

949
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:56,615
Scott: I had just boop gone.

950
01:03:56,916 --> 01:04:07,948
Rym: Well, well, I would keep as long as I wear this I can Simultaneously, oh my god, I got to start distributing that mp3.

951
01:04:08,471 --> 01:04:13,009
Scott: Yeah, you know any any any mp3 that was you know a record label whatever, you know.

952
01:04:13,974 --> 01:04:15,142
Scott: But yeah with books, right?

953
01:04:15,202 --> 01:04:16,410
Scott: I'm buying books now.

954
01:04:16,531 --> 01:04:19,290
Scott: So as far as I'm concerned right now books are a good deal.

955
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:25,630
Scott: You got a whole shit ton of pages a big freaking book full of words, right and they're relatively cheap.

956
01:04:25,690 --> 01:04:29,224
Scott: It's like five maybe bucks for a book on Amazon, right?

957
01:04:29,404 --> 01:04:30,810
Scott: Yeah, and you get a whole book.

958
01:04:31,131 --> 01:04:34,905
Scott: It's like hours and hours and hours of reading and it's high quality.

959
01:04:34,965 --> 01:04:40,653
Scott: right on the Kindle The books are like one dollar and it's just as much reading Plus.

960
01:04:41,295 --> 01:04:55,110
Rym: I actually really look forward to the kind of the rise of digital publishing of books because There is a barrier to entry to the mass market to small-time authors because getting a wide publication deal is very expensive.

961
01:04:55,673 --> 01:05:00,718
Rym: publishing online with a DRM thing Cost you nothing.

962
01:05:00,738 --> 01:05:02,625
Scott: Yeah me think about how many people.

963
01:05:02,685 --> 01:05:04,090
Scott: you have written novels, right?

964
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:06,130
Scott: And then no publisher would say yes to them.

965
01:05:07,034 --> 01:05:16,250
Scott: Most likely their book is crap, right, but even though their book is crap It might be the one that you like, you know, it's like there are only ten people in the world who would enjoy this book.

966
01:05:16,270 --> 01:05:17,057
Scott: We're not publishing it.

967
01:05:17,077 --> 01:05:18,490
Scott: Well, what if you're one of those ten people?

968
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:25,664
Scott: Well, if that guy puts that book out as an e-book and you got an e-reader hot damn You're gonna get that book and it's gonna be awesome.

969
01:05:25,824 --> 01:05:26,789
Rym: when we get to the point where?

970
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:37,249
Rym: Someone publishes their book and then the technic or dutifully buys exactly one copy Yeah, yeah, I just this whole time I've been thinking about Martin Solanas and his books.

971
01:05:38,751 --> 01:05:42,705
Scott: But yeah, think about you know, something like audible also right which has the DRM.

972
01:05:43,086 --> 01:05:44,250
Scott: Why don't I do audible?

973
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:45,533
Scott: Well, number one, I don't.

974
01:05:45,634 --> 01:05:48,242
Scott: I don't enjoy the audiobooks as much as the paper books.

975
01:05:48,383 --> 01:05:50,550
Rym: I don't very specific circumstance.

976
01:05:50,635 --> 01:06:00,143
Rym: Yes they gotta get the right person reading it and it has to be a book that does not benefit from the Phrasing and like the literary the word part on the page.

977
01:06:00,163 --> 01:06:01,870
Rym: Yep as opposed to the idea part.

978
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:03,196
Scott: That also also.

979
01:06:03,296 --> 01:06:04,120
Scott: I think that you know.

980
01:06:04,201 --> 01:06:11,530
Scott: reading on the page is a more Significant intellectual activity that works the brain in a far better and different way than listening.

981
01:06:11,671 --> 01:06:15,690
Rym: Well, my primary use for audiobooks are when I'm driving.

982
01:06:16,032 --> 01:06:19,030
Scott: Yeah, but I just use podcasts for that and I don't need an audiobook.

983
01:06:19,111 --> 01:06:20,849
Scott: But even if I didn't need an audiobook, right?

984
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:22,859
Scott: I'd say I had no podcast and I want it.

985
01:06:22,939 --> 01:06:25,050
Scott: I was had a drive a commute, you know.

986
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:27,249
Scott: That would be a good reason to get an audiobook.

987
01:06:27,953 --> 01:06:31,770
Scott: Why don't I do audible even without the DRM excuse of not doing audible?

988
01:06:32,776 --> 01:06:34,714
Scott: there is so expensive.

989
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:40,522
Scott: it's like $15 for a book on audible For like five bucks.

990
01:06:40,562 --> 01:06:41,249
Scott: I can just get the book.

991
01:06:42,034 --> 01:06:44,930
Scott: I can get three books to the price of one audio, but you're not paying for the book.

992
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:48,129
Rym: You're paying for like James Earl Jones to read it to you.

993
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:52,001
Scott: Yeah, but I you know, it's as far as I'm concerned though.

994
01:06:52,683 --> 01:06:54,770
Scott: It's the same, you know, it's the same thing.

995
01:06:54,930 --> 01:06:57,358
Scott: You're not gonna do read the book and listen to the audiobook.

996
01:06:57,799 --> 01:06:59,444
Scott: So why it's like?

997
01:07:00,046 --> 01:07:01,090
Scott: why would I do that?

998
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:05,622
Scott: There's no reason to Unless James Earl Jones came to my house and read it.

999
01:07:05,763 --> 01:07:06,668
Scott: That would that would be okay.

1000
01:07:06,688 --> 01:07:08,388
Rym: I think Cook me a little dinner.

1001
01:07:10,552 --> 01:07:12,923
Rym: I don't know if someone comes over to my house and reads to me.

1002
01:07:12,963 --> 01:07:14,409
Rym: I kind of want them to cook for me, too.

1003
01:07:14,971 --> 01:07:15,753
Scott: Okay, sure.

1004
01:07:16,355 --> 01:07:16,996
Scott: I'll read to you.

1005
01:07:17,016 --> 01:07:17,799
Scott: Will you cook for me?

1006
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:19,984
Rym: But I mean there are things.

1007
01:07:20,004 --> 01:07:27,070
Rym: I'm not gonna talk about the Kindle itself, but There are a lot of little things that I want that aren't necessarily deal-breakers like for one.

1008
01:07:27,774 --> 01:07:28,740
Rym: I want the ability to.

1009
01:07:29,364 --> 01:07:42,320
Rym: I want it to be a touchscreen so I can take a little stylus or something is built into it and Highlight a bunch of text and hit a button and it saves that text with an MLA and APA Citation and then we'll send it over the internet to my computer.

1010
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:44,126
Rym: That'd be pretty cool uploaded somewhere.

1011
01:07:44,146 --> 01:07:44,868
Scott: That's a real good one.

1012
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:45,853
Scott: I like that.

1013
01:07:46,255 --> 01:07:48,848
Rym: that that is something I've wanted for most of my life.

1014
01:07:49,109 --> 01:07:54,368
Scott: man If you did that the researchers would be like and students would be all over that You could just put all the textbooks on there.

1015
01:07:54,811 --> 01:08:01,950
Rym: The ripoff college textbook, I remember what like the biggest paper I ever wrote at RIT was this long like treatise on political communication.

1016
01:08:02,771 --> 01:08:03,877
Rym: There was like 15 pages.

1017
01:08:03,917 --> 01:08:06,710
Scott: You should have written a paper about citations with many citations in it.

1018
01:08:07,395 --> 01:08:08,970
Rym: The paper was 15 pages long.

1019
01:08:09,612 --> 01:08:15,390
Rym: It took me two hours to properly format and double-check all my citations.

1020
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:18,301
Rym: I could have written like a five page paper in that time.

1021
01:08:18,322 --> 01:08:18,965
Scott: Yeah, I know right?

1022
01:08:18,984 --> 01:08:21,435
Rym: I Want the Kindle to be able to do that.

1023
01:08:21,475 --> 01:08:29,109
Rym: plus I realize how much more often I would quote things And they're people set up like delicious like things or they would share quotations.

1024
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:31,879
Scott: Why don't we make a Firefox plug-in that does citations?

1025
01:08:31,939 --> 01:08:32,461
Rym: Let's do that.

1026
01:08:32,501 --> 01:08:33,505
Rym: That's really easy to make.

1027
01:08:33,765 --> 01:08:35,029
Rym: Yeah, that's really easy.

1028
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:36,093
Rym: No, not just that though.

1029
01:08:36,113 --> 01:08:40,227
Rym: You need to have a server where you can share citations and tag them.

1030
01:08:41,069 --> 01:08:42,957
Scott: Oh Oh wait, I found something.

1031
01:08:42,977 --> 01:08:44,001
Scott: tations and quotes though.

1032
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,390
Scott: Itro is easy to use Firefox extension.

1033
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:48,819
Scott: How do you collect manage and cite your research sources?

1034
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:51,490
Scott: It lives right where you do your work in the web browser itself.

1035
01:08:51,671 --> 01:08:52,273
Rym: I will check it out.

1036
01:08:52,332 --> 01:08:54,863
Rym: However, the Kindle needs to do that or I'm not that interested.

1037
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:55,484
Scott: Yeah.

1038
01:08:55,886 --> 01:08:56,689
Scott: Oh something exists.

1039
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:57,635
Scott: Someone beat us to it.

1040
01:08:57,895 --> 01:08:58,620
Scott: I wonder if it's good.

1041
01:08:58,841 --> 01:09:00,430
Rym: Yeah, I'm kind of dubious.

1042
01:09:00,792 --> 01:09:02,962
Rym: I feel like we could do it better whatever it is, but I don't know.

1043
01:09:03,002 --> 01:09:03,506
Rym: I'll check it out.

1044
01:09:03,546 --> 01:09:04,370
Scott: Yeah, it's got screencast.

1045
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:04,995
Scott: We'll be all right.

1046
01:09:05,236 --> 01:09:07,109
Scott: Yeah, it's also looking free and cool anyway.

1047
01:09:08,871 --> 01:09:09,736
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

1048
01:09:09,917 --> 01:09:18,741
Scott: also, you know like the user interface on these thing I mean the Kindle's got it right with the directly downloading wherever you are as long as this Wi-Fi going on Apple Taking take note.

1049
01:09:19,106 --> 01:09:26,126
Scott: Yeah Podcasts downloading a little weak actually Sony, you know Sony's ebook reader supposedly has a better screen.

1050
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:27,529
Scott: the Kindle and I think that is true.

1051
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:32,402
Scott: But also Sony's got a new like Walkman that actually does the podcast.

1052
01:09:32,421 --> 01:09:34,810
Scott: downloading properly doesn't have much else going for it.

1053
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:35,968
Scott: It needs to be a phone.

1054
01:09:36,911 --> 01:09:38,035
Scott: But you know, they.

1055
01:09:38,055 --> 01:09:40,684
Scott: finally there is a device at the proper podcast support.

1056
01:09:41,066 --> 01:09:43,537
Scott: Hooray Took long enough.

1057
01:09:43,818 --> 01:09:45,307
Rym: I mean beyond that there's a lot of little things.

1058
01:09:45,327 --> 01:09:48,279
Rym: That would be cool Like some you know, Netflix has the.

1059
01:09:48,299 --> 01:09:51,170
Rym: you rate things you read and you can recommend things to other people.

1060
01:09:51,912 --> 01:09:54,182
Rym: I'd like a built-in network for that like the Kindle could.

1061
01:09:54,202 --> 01:09:55,970
Scott: probably Amazon reviews are on there.

1062
01:09:56,362 --> 01:10:06,830
Rym: Yeah but I use the Kindle and I feel like it could be done in a better way to encourage people to Review books quickly and recommend books to their friends and you could subscribe to the right.

1063
01:10:07,191 --> 01:10:20,367
Scott: Amazon reviews is not as slick as Netflix with their reviewing and recommending and sharing and suggesting plus that Amazon mostly Amazon suggestion engine is more because remember Netflix doesn't care about which ones you pick.

1064
01:10:20,407 --> 01:10:21,330
Scott: they get your money anyway.

1065
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:25,425
Scott: Right, so they want you to help find things that you'll like that way.

1066
01:10:25,445 --> 01:10:26,368
Scott: You'll stay subscribed.

1067
01:10:26,529 --> 01:10:29,216
Scott: Amazon Right wants you to buy shit.

1068
01:10:29,457 --> 01:10:30,540
Scott: So there's subscription.

1069
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:40,350
Scott: their recommender is trying to find things that you are likely to buy Not things that your friends like or things like that, you know, because that's not gonna make you buy more.

1070
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:45,784
Scott: well, it might but you know Have we exhausted this topic possibly?

1071
01:10:45,804 --> 01:10:53,570
Rym: All right My plan is I'm probably gonna wait and wait until the Kindle 2 is out and I can hold one.

1072
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:55,868
Scott: I hope they make sort of like a Kindle mini as in.

1073
01:10:55,888 --> 01:11:01,671
Scott: you know I pod many because I've always been more a fan of the mini nano type things than like the big ones, you know Like.

1074
01:11:02,436 --> 01:11:05,053
Scott: so if there was like I got a 4-inch screen like no like.

1075
01:11:05,093 --> 01:11:12,669
Scott: I want it to be the size right like the screen should be the size of a You know mass-market trade paperback, you know the runs they have.

1076
01:11:12,729 --> 01:11:18,210
Scott: now The page is almost as big as like the page in a normal hardcover book, you know, it's kind of big.

1077
01:11:18,672 --> 01:11:21,945
Scott: I'd rather have a smaller one, you know, that's like, you know, you know this size.

1078
01:11:22,166 --> 01:11:30,022
Scott: No one can see this Like, you know the size of like a piece of paper from the Hyperion book, you know That size is how big I want it to be that way.

1079
01:11:30,063 --> 01:11:31,168
Scott: I can just sort of toss it in.

1080
01:11:31,711 --> 01:11:34,590
Scott: You know, I mean the Kindle is pretty small, but you can go smaller people.

1081
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:38,327
Rym: Of course, it has to be as indestructible as a Nintendo product.

1082
01:11:38,428 --> 01:11:39,713
Scott: Oh, of course I mean like books.

1083
01:11:39,853 --> 01:11:44,209
Scott: riggin beat the shit out of them all over the place and they they just keep keep on trucking.

1084
01:11:44,735 --> 01:11:46,733
Scott: Oh, that's another thing though Right is I?

1085
01:11:47,115 --> 01:11:51,310
Rym: the one thing with the DRM that does bother me can't just give books to other people when you're done with.

1086
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:52,495
Rym: It's no secondary market.

1087
01:11:52,555 --> 01:11:54,382
Scott: You can't lend right?

1088
01:11:54,402 --> 01:11:55,828
Scott: I mean right now I buy a book.

1089
01:11:56,169 --> 01:12:00,121
Scott: everyone I know can read that book but with the DRM not so much.

1090
01:12:00,201 --> 01:12:03,110
Scott: so there needs to be something to do with that, right?

1091
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:04,929
Scott: You know, I should be able to pass a book around.

1092
01:12:05,431 --> 01:12:07,197
Rym: Well, that's the problem with DRM.

1093
01:12:07,237 --> 01:12:25,441
Rym: is that companies realize that as there's so much media out there the second hand sale problem is becoming increasingly difficult to deal with because I Don't buy new books that often anymore because I'll go to like the strand which has every book I want to read ever for like four bucks

1094
01:12:25,562 --> 01:12:27,190
Scott: or more books than you can read ever.

1095
01:12:27,993 --> 01:12:39,258
Rym: Yeah, but any book I want that was written other than books that just came out today I can buy for like nothing at a used bookstore pretty handily yep, and video games books music.

1096
01:12:39,338 --> 01:12:47,087
Rym: everyone's having this problem and they're using the technological solution of digital distribution with DRM thus effectively.

1097
01:12:47,127 --> 01:12:53,989
Rym: in the end We're going to no longer have the right of first sale for any of our media And I don't know how I feel about that and I don't know what to do about it.

1098
01:12:54,471 --> 01:12:56,520
Scott: Yeah, I mean that's really they're putting.

1099
01:12:56,540 --> 01:13:02,110
Scott: what they are doing is they're putting in danger Right the the continued existence of culture.

1100
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:02,973
Scott: I mean like is.

1101
01:13:03,013 --> 01:13:07,810
Scott: a big problem is when you're researching old ancient shit, is that there are stone tablets?

1102
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:14,701
Scott: They didn't really make it, you know, and their papyrus really fucking didn't make it, you know We don't had the papyrus and now we don't know about them.

1103
01:13:14,761 --> 01:13:15,425
Scott: right there needs.

1104
01:13:15,445 --> 01:13:20,810
Scott: well in the future Maybe our books will make it because we sort of put them in a safe place, you know.

1105
01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:22,077
Scott: Can we know how to preserve them?

1106
01:13:22,137 --> 01:13:24,489
Scott: and maybe some other things will make it?

1107
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:29,530
Scott: DRM stuff ain't gonna make it to tomorrow if fucking someone turns the DRM server off.

1108
01:13:29,991 --> 01:13:31,255
Scott: So you're basically you put.

1109
01:13:31,356 --> 01:13:37,096
Scott: if you put some you know some song out into the world and the only form it's in is This DRM form.

1110
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:40,634
Scott: that song might not be here It's gonna be lost.

1111
01:13:40,956 --> 01:13:55,525
Rym: make a requirement anything that will be distributed with digital rights management must be submitted to say the Library of Congress and Kept there in Such and then it will be released to the public the moment the copyright expires

1112
01:13:55,886 --> 01:13:56,930
Scott: in a non DRM way

1113
01:13:57,031 --> 01:14:00,136
Rym: Yes an archive there Otherwise forever and then

1114
01:14:00,196 --> 01:14:08,610
Scott: the Library of Congress should just put every single piece of material It has that is not copyrighted just online for free for everyone in the US.

1115
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:09,573
Rym: Of course you realize.

1116
01:14:09,593 --> 01:14:22,336
Rym: what that will do is bring to full fruition the issue that I've been talking about for a long time that someday is going to destroy our current idea of the media market and the Competition of the past with the present.

1117
01:14:22,376 --> 01:14:26,470
Scott: Yep, if we actually that's the real I'm beginning to think that's the real reason.

1118
01:14:26,490 --> 01:14:29,650
Scott: They're extending copyright because it's not you know.

1119
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:35,005
Scott: Oh, no Elvis will enter public domain and then we won't be able to make money off Elvis anymore.

1120
01:14:35,166 --> 01:14:36,550
Scott: It's oh shit.

1121
01:14:37,154 --> 01:14:39,329
Scott: All the books from the 50s are now free.

1122
01:14:39,931 --> 01:14:45,268
Scott: No one will have any reason to buy a new book because they can just read all the books from the 50s.

1123
01:14:45,369 --> 01:14:49,070
Scott: and now there Are enough books available and enough music available for free.

1124
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:51,236
Scott: No one cares about new stuff anymore.

1125
01:14:51,297 --> 01:14:53,965
Scott: And then the 60s stuff will be free.

1126
01:14:54,346 --> 01:14:54,847
Scott: who cares?

1127
01:14:54,888 --> 01:14:55,670
Scott: They don't care that.

1128
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:57,590
Scott: They mean they're making a lot of money on Beatles music.

1129
01:14:57,690 --> 01:15:03,650
Scott: But but it's a care more about the fact that oh shit now everyone just listens to Beatles music for free.

1130
01:15:03,972 --> 01:15:04,495
Scott: I remember.

1131
01:15:04,515 --> 01:15:06,930
Scott: no one cares about the new music it becomes.

1132
01:15:08,012 --> 01:15:11,064
Rym: It gets bigger and bigger because more media is created.

1133
01:15:11,084 --> 01:15:12,710
Rym: It keeps getting worse there.

1134
01:15:13,353 --> 01:15:16,549
Rym: Every day there will be more competition than there ever was before

1135
01:15:17,071 --> 01:15:24,336
Scott: Yep, so why is anyone gonna buy music ever all the music from the 80s and previously, you know as public as we go

1136
01:15:24,476 --> 01:15:31,330
Rym: on you say like look at movies that Modern move like someone might argue that modern movies do things that old movies couldn't do.

1137
01:15:31,410 --> 01:15:36,990
Rym: Yes, but all media hit a terminal point where the technology cannot make them better.

1138
01:15:37,552 --> 01:15:50,583
Rym: The only thing that can make them better is writing them better and in the longest term, you know If we go all as a movie in the final last question is that eventually everything will be written Statistically every combination typewriters.

1139
01:15:50,683 --> 01:15:52,490
Scott: Yes, Shakespeare comes out eventually.

1140
01:15:53,551 --> 01:16:00,856
Scott: So yeah, then, you know, what do you do when you know, let's say let's say copyright is we reduce it to 40 years Right.

1141
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:09,889
Scott: So in 2040 right Everything every piece of artwork created in the 20th century will be free.

1142
01:16:10,231 --> 01:16:21,170
Rym: Which is why when our media than I could consume in my entire life if I dedicated my life to consuming media So why would anyone pay money for a 21st century piece of artwork?

1143
01:16:22,211 --> 01:16:29,089
Scott: when they could spend their entire life and be more than happy with everything ever from the 20th century for free?

1144
01:16:29,109 --> 01:16:39,859
Scott: and You know if they live to 2041 then all the stuff from the year 2000 will become free and if they live to 2042 Everything from 2001 will be free and so on and so forth.

1145
01:16:43,071 --> 01:16:52,088
Scott: So every year this year's worth of stuff will become free and without creating a new medium For artwork such as the feely's or something like that.

1146
01:16:53,952 --> 01:16:57,285
Rym: It's you got trouble now, I don't know what to do about that.

1147
01:16:57,425 --> 01:17:01,365
Rym: and that's not the topic of the show So I suppose we'll end it there.

1148
01:17:01,385 --> 01:17:02,230
