1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,549
Rym: It's November 5th, 2012.

2
00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:12,051
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,392 --> 00:00:16,706
Rym: I'm Scott and it's got Fox day Tonight, we're talking about.

4
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:18,895
Scott: you can go check yourself.

5
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:19,979
Rym: It's a box with a bomb.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,742
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:26,751
Scott: Oh wait.

8
00:00:26,771 --> 00:00:28,715
Rym: I guess you haven't seen slayers.

9
00:00:28,815 --> 00:00:29,436
Rym: try yet.

10
00:00:29,456 --> 00:00:31,160
Rym: You don't know about the fox with bombs.

11
00:00:32,201 --> 00:00:33,205
Scott: You and your foxes bomb.

12
00:00:33,527 --> 00:00:35,314
Rym: you're gonna like that box and his bomb.

13
00:00:35,414 --> 00:00:36,780
Scott: I can imagine the fox with bombs.

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,567
Scott: I probably you know almost like.

15
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:42,059
Scott: it's like there's a picture of one of my brain, and I'm pretty sure it'll match up.

16
00:00:43,362 --> 00:00:47,320
Scott: When I see the one that is the one you were talking about at one point gallery eats one of his bombs.

17
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:48,768
Scott: I think why wouldn't you?

18
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:57,100
Rym: he was hungry, so yeah, yeah But I remember the fifth of November primarily because that's when I got my first job in the financial sector and started making money.

19
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:04,471
Scott: I didn't remember at all until some tweets talked about how most people you know talk about it But don't actually know anything about it.

20
00:01:04,593 --> 00:01:05,719
Rym: You know anything about it?

21
00:01:06,222 --> 00:01:07,770
Scott: There was a dude named Guy Fawkes.

22
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:08,273
Scott: Yes.

23
00:01:08,494 --> 00:01:10,309
Scott: He was a crazy monarchist.

24
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:15,217
Scott: yes He tried to bomb the Parliament in England.

25
00:01:15,398 --> 00:01:20,639
Scott: in London He put a bunch of gunpowder in some barrels in the basement, and he's about to light it.

26
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:32,734
Scott: They caught him pretty much yeah, and he's basically like the Unabomber And he sort of looked like the v-mask but not really.

27
00:01:32,794 --> 00:01:34,940
Scott: but pictures of him look like that right the same way.

28
00:01:35,282 --> 00:01:37,033
Scott: You know what we think George Washington looked like.

29
00:01:37,073 --> 00:01:42,000
Scott: he probably looked a little different You know because you know paintings of them don't look exactly the way he looked.

30
00:01:42,522 --> 00:01:44,733
Scott: I don't think there's any photographs of George Washington.

31
00:01:44,794 --> 00:01:45,638
Scott: right well.

32
00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:46,060
Rym: We gotta wait.

33
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,790
Rym: There's got to be some guy on a TV George Washington.

34
00:01:49,810 --> 00:02:05,752
Scott: so on the fifth of November right the tradition in The UK is to you know wear the mask or whatever while you know making sort of a a dummy Out of you know to to be Guy Fawkes and then setting him on fire

35
00:02:05,873 --> 00:02:07,096
Rym: as it burns like an effigy

36
00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:07,919
Scott: as an effigy.

37
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,020
Scott: So sort of be like you know it'd be like if we have we maybe put a hoodie on a guy.

38
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,267
Scott: I was like it's the Unabomber.

39
00:02:13,327 --> 00:02:14,855
Scott: Let's fuck him and set him on fire.

40
00:02:15,076 --> 00:02:21,867
Scott: so the other Not in the literal sense One of the other nothing fucks like an effigy.

41
00:02:21,887 --> 00:02:23,532
Scott: There's a hundred definitions of fuck.

42
00:02:23,672 --> 00:02:25,197
Scott: We're not talking about the sexual one.

43
00:02:25,217 --> 00:02:36,175
Rym: so the reason I think about it is that on October 5th the Fake Twitter account for Archer like the character Archer tweeted something about Guy Fawkes day.

44
00:02:36,195 --> 00:02:37,620
Scott: I don't think you got it wrong.

45
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:41,031
Scott: Yep, was that an intentional joke or guessing?

46
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:43,500
Scott: it was person who had that account was dumb.

47
00:02:43,802 --> 00:02:45,760
Scott: I don't remember the fifth of October.

48
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:54,538
Rym: I am guessing the latter, but someone responded elegantly and they were like ah yes the rhyme says it well remember remember the fifth of October.

49
00:02:55,887 --> 00:03:07,010
Scott: Yeah Remember it well It was ten five and I'm sure it in 2015 someone's gonna be like oh my god It's 1015 2015. lots of ones and fives.

50
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,375
Rym: I was up in Albany this weekend.

51
00:03:08,395 --> 00:03:15,180
Rym: I went to visit a distillery Okay, where they distill spirits, and I tried to say legal distillery was any moonshine.

52
00:03:15,421 --> 00:03:18,099
Rym: So it was a legal one and the guy who runs it was totally chill.

53
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:18,280
Rym: one.

54
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,905
Rym: He was like this isn't moonshine.

55
00:03:19,925 --> 00:03:20,989
Rym: and two.

56
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:21,892
Rym: he was like.

57
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,099
Rym: we asked him a lot of questions as Pete was there.

58
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:25,600
Rym: Pete You know Pete knows this stuff.

59
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:25,684
Scott: Yep.

60
00:03:26,242 --> 00:03:32,160
Rym: So one point where we had I think we asked him something like Does it matter if you do this and that in the distilling process?

61
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,187
Rym: He was like it doesn't matter for fucking shit.

62
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,371
Rym: You're distilling it.

63
00:03:35,391 --> 00:03:38,020
Rym: You're removing 99% of anything that was in there.

64
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,622
Scott: That's right.

65
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:46,680
Rym: He was like we do what matters and we don't do what doesn't matter and he was totally chill in science Mm-hmm, so I bought a very large bottle of vodka made from apple cores.

66
00:03:47,382 --> 00:03:48,907
Scott: I thought vodka is made from potatoes.

67
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:51,495
Rym: Well it can be made from basically anything vodka.

68
00:03:51,836 --> 00:04:04,525
Rym: Here's the thing in the US Americans like vodka to be grain neutral meaning it tastes like Nothing, but alcohol because they use it to make silly frou-frou bullshit drinks, and they don't like the taste of alcohol But they want to get drunk.

69
00:04:04,685 --> 00:04:10,168
Rym: that is a vodak tastes like so when an American you know when people say they like gray Goose or one of those like good vodkas.

70
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:11,935
Scott: They actually smelled that.

71
00:04:11,995 --> 00:04:13,300
Scott: it smelled like alcohol.

72
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:15,175
Rym: Yeah, they want something that doesn't taste like anything.

73
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:16,503
Rym: so in Russia It smells like.

74
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:17,648
Scott: it tastes like alcohol.

75
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,480
Rym: in Russia good vodka tastes like fucking potatoes.

76
00:04:21,165 --> 00:04:25,769
Scott: I imagined it does but in America It tastes like nothing even though potato tastes good.

77
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:26,452
Scott: would you agree?

78
00:04:26,552 --> 00:04:28,780
Scott: potato chip baked potato right potato?

79
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,760
Scott: You would not want to eat a plain of raw potato that does not taste good.

80
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,891
Scott: You need to do something to it to make it not taste like that.

81
00:04:37,132 --> 00:04:41,426
Rym: so anyway this core vodka is made from apple cores But it's not well.

82
00:04:41,526 --> 00:04:44,376
Scott: apple cores on tastes like apple, and is there an arsenic situation.

83
00:04:44,396 --> 00:04:49,440
Rym: No it's not arsenic It's cyanide for one either one which not only.

84
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:52,748
Scott: Not only is the percentage so small it doesn't matter.

85
00:04:52,808 --> 00:04:56,479
Rym: yeah, so you read the name of the wind right.

86
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:58,085
Scott: yeah That comes up there.

87
00:04:58,105 --> 00:05:01,197
Rym: I know the girl is like isn't there arsenic in this bullshit.

88
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:01,518
Rym: He's like.

89
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:03,044
Rym: well one It's actually cyanide.

90
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:06,355
Scott: I'm glad that you got my reference far too late thinking.

91
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:07,720
Scott: I was not making a reference.

92
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:14,580
Rym: I got the reference right away, however I knew you and I was wondering if you in fact had it wrong and forgot that that was brought up in the book.

93
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:15,444
Scott: No, I know.

94
00:05:15,464 --> 00:05:22,031
Rym: I do enjoy however how the dragons going nuts And then they realize I go you can't save this with a book club episode.

95
00:05:22,092 --> 00:05:24,660
Rym: There's basically a meth lab out here in the forest.

96
00:05:28,222 --> 00:05:28,905
Rym: That was a good scene.

97
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:29,426
Rym: I like that.

98
00:05:29,446 --> 00:05:33,380
Rym: yeah, I finished the book on the subway home, so okay about that.

99
00:05:33,802 --> 00:05:34,808
Rym: I'll save that for the matter moment.

100
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:35,452
Scott: shall we move on?

101
00:05:35,694 --> 00:05:43,720
Rym: yeah, we can move on but anyway I am drinking the Applejack right now because they made core vodka which tastes It's like vodka with a hint of Apple instead of a hint of potato.

102
00:05:44,242 --> 00:05:45,366
Rym: It's really fucking good.

103
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,538
Scott: and to don't drink how much him what amount of it.

104
00:05:48,558 --> 00:05:49,080
Scott: can you drink?

105
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,686
Scott: That's basically what proof is that?

106
00:05:51,028 --> 00:05:52,373
Rym: It's 80 proof.

107
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,020
Scott: You're drinking a very small amount.

108
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,583
Rym: Yes, this is 40% so that much of this glass is pure Grain alcohol.

109
00:05:58,623 --> 00:06:01,254
Scott: should you not maybe put something in there besides that?

110
00:06:01,454 --> 00:06:02,800
Scott: no how about a slice of Apple?

111
00:06:03,761 --> 00:06:04,426
Rym: I guess I could do that.

112
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:07,106
Scott: the thing is this is what variety of Apple Did they use?

113
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:08,660
Rym: you know what that was asked?

114
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,725
Rym: You know what the distiller said.

115
00:06:09,746 --> 00:06:11,394
Rym: mm-hmm doesn't fucking matter.

116
00:06:11,695 --> 00:06:12,520
Scott: What do you matters?

117
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,683
Rym: You it doesn't matter.

118
00:06:13,743 --> 00:06:16,414
Scott: I say you make it twice once with Fuji once with.

119
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,820
Scott: yeah, you know what he's there.

120
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,683
Rym: You distill it.

121
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:20,149
Rym: There's no difference.

122
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,338
Scott: There's some Apple flavor in there is there not?

123
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:24,840
Scott: yes What Apple flavor does it taste like Apple?

124
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:29,117
Rym: So like the Apple do you want to try to say every time Apple this tastes like I?

125
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:36,513
Scott: It's probably tastes like Apple juices every Apple mixed together If you use only one kind of Apple in one and only what he uses.

126
00:06:36,553 --> 00:06:38,720
Rym: cider apples whatever cider apples.

127
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:40,396
Rym: Yeah, you know what Apple Jack is I?

128
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,984
Scott: Apples that fell on the ground.

129
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:46,602
Rym: so it was a common because they're cheaper because they can't sell them to the grocers a common alcoholic beverage In Michigan.

130
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:57,019
Rym: basically what you do is you take you make a hard apple cider Freeze it and you cut the middle out of the barrel because that's the alcohol and it was like this freeze distillation.

131
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,164
Rym: So This is Apple Jack.

132
00:07:01,184 --> 00:07:02,870
Scott: prefer the science lab distillation?

133
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,820
Rym: yes, so this is the science lab version of Apple.

134
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,125
Scott: Oh, not the freezing method.

135
00:07:07,206 --> 00:07:07,406
Rym: No.

136
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:10,640
Scott: This is a lot of people try to do the freezing method in their freezers.

137
00:07:11,285 --> 00:07:15,159
Rym: Yeah, not doing that that is moonshine moonshine style.

138
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:18,709
Rym: So yeah, I'm drinking my Apple Jack.

139
00:07:18,749 --> 00:07:19,211
Rym: I'm digging it.

140
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:19,733
Scott: Okay.

141
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:20,839
Scott: I'm getting jacked up.

142
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:21,945
Rym: So you got some news.

143
00:07:22,227 --> 00:07:23,233
Rym: you want to try some Apple Jack.

144
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:23,515
Rym: No.

145
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:24,239
Scott: I have a news.

146
00:07:24,962 --> 00:07:26,688
Scott: So you know how I was.

147
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:34,779
Scott: I was complaining very recently about companies Not telling people for reasons when they fuck them over like got rid of all your Kindle books.

148
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:38,418
Scott: not gonna Tell you why yeah, or closed your account.

149
00:07:38,498 --> 00:07:39,846
Scott: not gonna Tell you why just that.

150
00:07:39,887 --> 00:07:40,852
Scott: we closed your account.

151
00:07:40,913 --> 00:07:52,020
Rym: meanwhile while we talked about this You know last time my company when we you know hurricane happened We were operating out of our like business continuity plan BS Rather than pretending that was completely business as normal actually emailed every one of her customers.

152
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,575
Rym: We were like hey, we're working out of the backup data center, so yeah good job.

153

Scott: Don't even get into that.

160
00:08:13,843 --> 00:08:18,527
Scott: We've talked about this but Twitter does receive DMC notices And they don't really want to have a legal team.

161
00:08:18,608 --> 00:08:21,560
Scott: fight them like if I link to an illegal thing in a tweet.

162
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:25,560
Scott: Someone might send a DMC thing to take my tweet down even though my tweets just a link.

163
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,135
Scott: But Twitter is not gonna fight that for you.

164
00:08:27,155 --> 00:08:29,035
Scott: right that is gonna Take you down because I don't give a shit.

165
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:29,962
Scott: yep So.

166
00:08:30,062 --> 00:08:32,433
Scott: but what they used to do is just delete your fucking tweet.

167
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,039
Scott: because but the fuck right.

168
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:37,159
Scott: But now they are actually doing a good thing.

169
00:08:37,902 --> 00:08:51,716
Scott: The good thing is let's say I tweet something and somehow I put I don't know in that 140 characters I fit all of Star Wars And Disney sends a DMCA notice like hey Scott's tweet has fucking all of Star Wars in it.

170
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:52,920
Scott: what the fuck right.

171
00:08:52,940 --> 00:09:01,059
Rym: wait So if I tweeted the entire script of Star Wars 144 characters at a time Would they send individual notices for each one of them?

172
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,643
Rym: I don't know.

173
00:09:01,925 --> 00:09:03,897
Rym: and how many of them would they have to remove before?

174
00:09:03,957 --> 00:09:05,380
Rym: I would say well I'm no longer infringing.

175
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:11,563
Scott: I'm sure Twitter must have some policy about the close your account after so many but anyway what they are doing now is they're not Gonna delete your tweet.

176
00:09:11,603 --> 00:09:15,879
Scott: instead they put a special thing on your tweet, so of course no one can see it.

177
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:19,053
Scott: But you you can still see your tweet that it's there.

178
00:09:19,173 --> 00:09:19,997
Scott: You know you made it.

179
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:20,700
Scott: You won't hallucinate.

180
00:09:20,902 --> 00:09:23,200
Rym: What do they do about retweets of the tree tweet prior?

181
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,260
Scott: I'm sure it does the same thing, but what if it's the old style RT retweets?

182
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:27,805
Rym: I don't know.

183
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:41,540
Scott: or a quote anyway I don't know, but what they also do is they put a notice there for you to see like hey Yo, dog this tweet was taken down because blah blah blah and weren't they doing something like that for like tweets?

184
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:47,919
Scott: Notice that was sent to Twitter to tell them to take it down is posted on chilling effects where you can go.

185
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:50,647
Scott: check it Out nice, so this is like.

186
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:51,950
Scott: Oh wait auto posted.

187
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,139
Rym: What do you mean like automatically posted on chilling effects?

188
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:55,179
Scott: I?

189
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,838
Scott: See the copyright notices Twitter receives can be seen on the chilling effects website.

190
00:10:00,858 --> 00:10:07,905
Scott: nice That is exactly how you should handle that so you can go and if you get a tweet that is taken down You can go.

191
00:10:07,985 --> 00:10:08,768
Scott: see why.

192
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:13,860
Scott: if you don't want your tweet taking down at all and you want to fight it Set up your own Twitter on your own computer.

193
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:18,573
Rym: Remember when we decided Twitter was BS, and we ran a laconica server.

194
00:10:19,014 --> 00:10:21,763
Scott: It is BS that it's not Federated.

195
00:10:21,843 --> 00:10:23,432
Scott: yeah, yeah, it's.

196
00:10:23,452 --> 00:10:24,739
Scott: there's not much you can do about things.

197
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,911
Rym: We could use laconica and all of it's not that goodness.

198
00:10:28,032 --> 00:10:30,260
Scott: No this something better will come along soon enough.

199
00:10:30,802 --> 00:10:32,468
Rym: Well, I don't think it will soon enough.

200
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,696
Scott: Federation has won every bad.

201
00:10:34,716 --> 00:10:35,358
Rym: Yes, it has.

202
00:10:35,378 --> 00:10:39,034
Scott: however It's only a matter of time before Federation wins this battle.

203
00:10:39,376 --> 00:10:40,160
Scott: give it ten no one.

204
00:10:40,602 --> 00:10:43,074
Rym: Yeah, ten years that is neither soon nor enough.

205
00:10:43,255 --> 00:10:44,119
Scott: How is that not soon?

206
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:56,180
Rym: It's soon on the scale of social change among old people among Technologists now that ten years from now is effectively like Mad Max far well here.

207
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,042
Scott: Well, let's see about this.

208
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,068
Scott: when did instant messaging exist?

209
00:10:59,268 --> 00:11:00,151
Scott: when a wall came out?

210
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:00,271
Scott: 97.

211
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:00,833
Scott: I was using ICQ.

212
00:11:03,686 --> 00:11:06,467
Scott: Okay Neither one of those is federated right.

213
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:07,752
Scott: so let's give it 97 right.

214
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:12,050
Scott: 95 97 Right somewhere in there mid 90s.

215
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:14,380
Scott: When did G chat win?

216
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,348
Rym: It's hard to say because I kind of stopped using.

217
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:18,694
Rym: I am as AOL died.

218
00:11:18,775 --> 00:11:19,679
Scott: you mean you used each head.

219
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:28,666
Rym: now I used each head But it doesn't actually serve the same purpose because the vast majority of people I know are never logged into it And I can't chat with them.

220
00:11:28,907 --> 00:11:30,132
Scott: I'm just saying when did it win?

221
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:30,875
Scott: it didn't win.

222
00:11:30,935 --> 00:11:31,799
Rym: That's what I'm saying.

223
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:37,039
Rym: did AOL and ICQ in my life were replaced with fucking nothing.

224
00:11:38,482 --> 00:11:41,320
Scott: G chat won I'd say when I used name Scott.

225
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:44,854
Rym: I had like 300 people on my list and I knew all of them who would talk to them.

226
00:11:45,135 --> 00:11:55,679
Rym: right now there are 14 people online in my list and another like 20 that are not online And you know what the majority of them are g-plus contacts who don't ever respond if I message them.

227
00:11:56,462 --> 00:12:00,216
Scott: Pretty sure Google Chat won sometimes shortly after you're out of college.

228
00:12:00,497 --> 00:12:04,779
Scott: You didn't win 06 so it took about 10 years like to not win.

229
00:12:05,802 --> 00:12:06,424
Rym: It didn't win.

230
00:12:06,444 --> 00:12:06,866
Scott: it won.

231
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:09,395
Rym: It didn't replay didn't do what it did before.

232
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:10,640
Scott: it does what it did before.

233
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,811
Scott: Well, just not just cuz you're not using it the same way.

234
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:14,700
Rym: You know, I am using it the same way.

235
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,752
Rym: The problem is everyone else I know and knew is not.

236
00:12:17,772 --> 00:12:19,720
Scott: that's not my problem.

237
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:22,807
Scott: It's still the other instant messaging.

238
00:12:22,847 --> 00:12:23,690
Scott: things have faded.

239
00:12:24,212 --> 00:12:25,416
Scott: the G chat has elevated.

240
00:12:25,436 --> 00:12:41,764
Rym: that is all that is therefore So the the previous world order disappeared and a very very pale simulacrum of that world order Instead of your craziness so long time ago as in October.

241
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:43,430
Rym: no, no, no, I'm gonna go even older.

242
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,815
Scott: even remember.

243
00:12:44,876 --> 00:12:47,385
Scott: remember the October September 22nd.

244
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:51,172
Rym: There was news posted and people were talking about.

245
00:12:51,473 --> 00:12:57,366
Rym: now the headlines were Ermagerd Ubuntu has Amazon ads Pre-installed.

246
00:12:57,386 --> 00:12:59,255
Scott: let me just cheat you this link.

247
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:02,523
Rym: Yeah Chat I can.

248
00:13:03,045 --> 00:13:03,827
Rym: I can listen.

249
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,712
Scott: you continue with your news here.

250
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:06,936
Scott: Stop diverting.

251
00:13:07,176 --> 00:13:08,360
Rym: I'm just saying no one else does.

252
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:11,325
Scott: You're diverting Just repeating the same thing.

253
00:13:11,465 --> 00:13:15,780
Scott: if I message everyone who's not gonna make that the whole show repeating the same thing over and over again?

254
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,586
Scott: That could be a show.

255
00:13:16,627 --> 00:13:17,514
Scott: go back to your news.

256
00:13:17,736 --> 00:13:22,054
Rym: Okay, so Ermagerd Ubuntu is gonna have Amazon ads in it.

257
00:13:22,095 --> 00:13:22,939
Rym: now, of course true.

258
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:27,658
Rym: Yes, the majority of people who saw that at first were like no that is clearly some sort of hyperbolic.

259
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:28,160
Rym: No, it's true.

260
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,566
Rym: It's true straight up true.

261
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:42,154
Rym: So the deal is if you use Ubuntu Ubuntu 1210 or newer And you use that little - search feel like in Windows and I start like right now.

262
00:13:42,214 --> 00:13:45,983
Rym: I start typing like I don't know putty Up there.

263
00:13:46,003 --> 00:13:47,768
Rym: it is a found putty on my file system.

264
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:48,049
Scott: Yep.

265
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,054
Rym: So now I'm going to determine.

266
00:13:50,114 --> 00:13:54,088
Rym: Yeah if I do that equivalently It'll find putty.

267
00:13:54,108 --> 00:13:55,720
Rym: I guess I don't need putty in Ubuntu.

268
00:13:55,881 --> 00:13:58,611
Scott: It'll also give you a link to buy silly putty on Amazon.

269
00:13:58,731 --> 00:14:01,180
Scott: And if you buy silly putty Amazon gets affiliate dollars.

270
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:02,290
Rym: Yeah.

271
00:14:03,505 --> 00:14:09,188
Scott: So it's like if you type in terminal I tried this you get you know The link to click on to open your terminal.

272
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:12,460
Rym: you also get this like terminal you can buy for a dollar.

273
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,075
Scott: Well, you also get like terminal 5 the band by their album.

274
00:14:16,678 --> 00:14:18,905
Rym: So one This is stupid.

275
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:22,818
Rym: Yeah - it's useless to anyone smart.

276
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:23,380
Rym: three.

277
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:39,977
Rym: It's only gonna piss off nerds who are a full half of Ubuntu's user base a full 90% now because I think the other half is grandmas and parents and Cheap people who for whom the neighborhood kid or grandson gave them a computer with Ubuntu on it.

278
00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:42,748
Scott: that happens But I believe it is rarer than I

279
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:54,526
Rym: think that happens more than you think because the nerds By and large seem to be doubling down in the other direction and are using like scientific Linux or other craziness And outside like in no one's

280
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:55,189
Scott: using that

281
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,232
Rym: in companies.

282
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:59,844
Rym: Most people use CentOS or Suzy still.

283
00:14:59,864 --> 00:15:00,726
Scott: yeah, it's true.

284
00:15:00,926 --> 00:15:03,293
Scott: It's in the you know, the bigger company.

285
00:15:03,393 --> 00:15:04,055
Rym: as an aside.

286
00:15:04,396 --> 00:15:07,222
Rym: I recently installed Ubuntu Ubuntu.

287
00:15:07,262 --> 00:15:14,546
Rym: yeah, so just cuz I needed a Linux box to you know, do real computing on And I had previously used CentOS.

288
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:20,648
Rym: Oh my god - sent OS suck fucking ass for anything desktop Yep, or server.

289
00:15:20,668 --> 00:15:22,680
Rym: Yep, but it would use not good as server either.

290
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,698
Scott: So the server but is not too bad depends on what you need to run if they have the package.

291
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:28,605
Rym: for yeah You want to use Tomcat anything?

292
00:15:29,107 --> 00:15:30,070
Scott: No, you don't do that.

293
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,655
Scott: No bad choice granted.

294
00:15:31,695 --> 00:15:37,880
Scott: It's hard to use Tomcat in any Linux But the Ubuntu one the default Tomcat if you have to get it is all weird.

295
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:39,708
Rym: But anyway, this was the thing.

296
00:15:39,748 --> 00:15:42,360
Rym: and of course there was the major crazy outrage.

297
00:15:42,862 --> 00:15:45,414
Rym: So there's the follow-up story of shuttleworth saying trust us.

298
00:15:45,434 --> 00:15:46,640
Rym: We're trying to make shopping better.

299
00:15:47,862 --> 00:15:48,384
Rym: No, you're not.

300
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:49,429
Rym: No, you're not.

301
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:56,711
Rym: No, what you're trying to do is siphon Affiliate dollars from people who are dumb enough to go.

302
00:15:57,113 --> 00:16:03,500
Scott: Oh, I guess I do need silly putty Mostly nerds who are going to use that default desktop, right?

303
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,121
Scott: It's.

304
00:16:04,141 --> 00:16:08,908
Scott: but just doing anything it can to try to find a way to make money When the only product they have is a free.

305
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:11,057
Rym: now pretty reason I bring all this up is one.

306
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:26,395
Rym: the newest story There's the trifecta here is that the EFF has basically come out and said hey Ubuntu stop this bullshit make that disabled by default because independent of my Ideological complaints and my I don't want to see ads ever complaints.

307
00:16:26,515 --> 00:16:27,980
Rym: I mean, there's a reason I use adblock.

308
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,810
Rym: Yeah, the operating system is sacred ground.

309
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:32,276
Rym: You don't fuck with that.

310
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:42,320
Rym: And while you're gonna say That is not the operating system for the majority of people that is the operating system as far as they're concerned.

311
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:53,000
Scott: Yes, but not by the technical definition of the term operating system Yes, but by the definition of software that is installed on your computer before you have chosen to install additional software.

312
00:16:53,301 --> 00:17:00,027
Rym: Yes, so you the GNU Linux beard is in fact a hundred percent technically correct and useless For a normal person.

313
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:02,377
Rym: if they install they put the Ubuntu CD in.

314
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:04,184
Rym: when they're done They've got that's Ubuntu.

315
00:17:04,385 --> 00:17:08,380
Rym: Yeah, whatever they see when they log in even the applications that aren't Ubuntu like Firefox.

316
00:17:08,801 --> 00:17:09,789
Rym: so people have been afraid.

317
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:17,060
Rym: nerds have been afraid forever of Microsoft or Larry Ellison and all his bullshit putting ads in the operating system.

318
00:17:18,026 --> 00:17:24,980
Rym: I know what you're trying to do Ubuntu But all you're doing is going up to a bunch of angry nerds and poking them with a sharp stick.

319
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:29,321
Rym: I don't have anything else to say about it Other than that.

320
00:17:29,342 --> 00:17:31,628
Rym: the EFS concerns have nothing to do with that.

321
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:37,949
Rym: Their concern is simply yeah, so you're sending Amazon Information and then getting back results.

322
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,134
Scott: You're sending Amazon.

323
00:17:39,254 --> 00:17:43,464
Scott: everything everyone types into Their.

324
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:53,079
Rym: so when the guy's typing like my little pony fanfiction because he's trying to find his folder of fanfiction Amazon's gonna see that and recommend things.

325
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,433
Rym: now Gmail does that too, but at least it's.

326
00:17:57,573 --> 00:18:02,778
Rym: you're not typing my little pony fan You're not searching you're not using Gmail to search your own computer.

327
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:16,200
Rym: Yep so this is bad all around and it is possible to turn it off, but Even if it is it really reduces the trust of Ubuntu as a Linux distribution.

328
00:18:16,401 --> 00:18:18,107
Scott: That's why this stuff like mint and shit.

329
00:18:18,408 --> 00:18:21,320
Scott: Yeah, but in that desktop that you know, it's not really that good.

330
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:22,279
Rym: I don't like it at all.

331
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:32,223
Rym: But Windows 8 the metro that's not called metro anymore is just as bad in every account except for the fact that doesn't show me Ads, but that's a separate discussion Really?

332
00:18:32,283 --> 00:18:39,979
Scott: I know a lot of people who upgrade to Windows 8 because it is better in some under-the-hood ways And it is disable the metro and just go straight to the regular.

333
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,160
Rym: now My fear is not that metro sucks because I can get around it.

334
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,550
Rym: My fear is that the desktop side of it will be deprecated.

335
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:54,639
Rym: Mmm and a UEFI and all that other stuff, but The reason I bring up this whole thing with Ubuntu is because it wound to what it says.

336
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:55,901
Rym: Really?

337
00:18:56,482 --> 00:19:03,140
Rym: Is that desktop Linux is in fact dead and they need money or it will die?

338
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,768
Scott: Well is the thing I actually they do need money.

339
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:09,320
Scott: at least Ubuntu needs money, but what other desktop Linux is there?

340
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,366
Scott: Well, I think what I think what could happen?

341
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:16,000
Rym: we had the HTPC movement with boxy, but boxy went a little bastard.

342
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,431
Scott: Here's here's what I can see in the future.

343
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:20,500
Scott: Notice boxy didn't do too well with this.

344
00:19:21,762 --> 00:19:23,156
Scott: Here's what I see in the future, right?

345
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,740
Scott: Normal peoples who only use their computers for normal type things.

346
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,490
Scott: Right They don't really aren't gonna need a laptop desktop.

347
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,057
Scott: They're gonna get by with a tablet phone.

348
00:19:36,097 --> 00:19:41,739
Scott: Maybe some you know similar Apple TV kind of device in the TV something something right.

349
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:48,000
Scott: and The only thing desktops will be used for is people who need to do work and people want to play games.

350
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:49,108
Scott: And that's pretty much it.

351
00:19:49,693 --> 00:19:50,378
Scott: and they're not gonna be.

352
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:56,140
Rym: you know No, when you say games you mean PC games the traditional sense not Angry Birds serious games, right?

353
00:19:57,222 --> 00:20:01,180
Scott: So that's the only reason people are gonna have desktops to do work and play games.

354
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:06,414
Rym: So I'm here to do work and play games and in that all out of operating.

355
00:20:06,475 --> 00:20:08,420
Scott: and in that sense, right?

356
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,247
Scott: I think Windows was gonna.

357
00:20:10,267 --> 00:20:13,479
Scott: you know, it's just the library of games for Windows is so big.

358
00:20:14,202 --> 00:20:17,637
Scott: it's gonna take a long time to make Windows not needed for games,

359
00:20:17,858 --> 00:20:18,179
Rym: but I

360
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:42,460
Scott: Could see the newer versions of Windows being bad and the steam Linux coming on so strong such that You know in some number of years, maybe ten years, whatever the other thing I talked about will happen when Twitter's federated You will have you know, the games will come out for Linux because that's the only you know.

361
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,130
Scott: Modern operating you couldn't you?

362
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:47,587
Scott: there'll be a point at which you know Windows 7 can read you only.

363
00:20:47,607 --> 00:20:52,949
Scott: you need to keep a Windows 7 around to run the vast library of old games But it won't be an operating system.

364
00:20:52,969 --> 00:20:55,140
Scott: You can actually use for computing daily.

365
00:20:55,482 --> 00:20:57,993
Scott: So you'll need to use Linux for that or OS X those be.

366
00:20:58,074 --> 00:21:01,495
Scott: if OS X is even still around It could be all iOS by then.

367
00:21:01,515 --> 00:21:01,878
Scott: You don't know.

368
00:21:02,602 --> 00:21:07,057
Scott: so you're gonna run Linux and new games and your everyday computing.

369
00:21:07,097 --> 00:21:10,753
Scott: Linux II and Windows will be around for your old games the same way.

370
00:21:10,773 --> 00:21:12,180
Scott: Some people's love DOS for old games.

371
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,922
Rym: Well, we'll see there's.

372
00:21:12,963 --> 00:21:17,197
Scott: there's another factor that are but most people won't even have a desktop.

373
00:21:17,237 --> 00:21:28,367
Rym: our good friend Conrad Did link to an article recently that was actually very interesting the one that talked about how it argued that the shittier a person is Using computers the more powerful machine They actually need the.

374
00:21:28,427 --> 00:21:38,260
Rym: the gist of it was that someone like me or Scott or some of you who are listening If I have a shitty ask him like a 486, I understand its limitations and I can deal with all of its limitations.

375
00:21:38,461 --> 00:21:39,345
Rym: I know what I'm doing.

376
00:21:39,706 --> 00:21:46,931
Rym: So some some crappy little netbook or like my laptop my new laptop It only has like 120 gigabytes of space total.

377
00:21:46,951 --> 00:21:50,080
Rym: Mm-hmm, and that's fine for what I'm doing.

378
00:21:50,461 --> 00:21:54,956
Rym: But if you gave that laptop just some random schmo using the computer that's usually those people.

379
00:21:54,996 --> 00:21:56,120
Scott: they only have one computer.

380
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,325
Scott: That's their computer period.

381
00:21:57,345 --> 00:21:57,968
Scott: they don't have most.

382
00:21:58,008 --> 00:21:58,952
Rym: fill it up immediately.

383
00:21:58,992 --> 00:22:08,069
Scott: with his iTunes collection and his torrents He doesn't know about things being stored in spaces or which hard drives filling up or right and his CPU He'd probably install.

384
00:22:08,089 --> 00:22:13,560
Scott: Kansas spywares Need a bigger CPU and more RAM to make the computer not be useless after he's fucked it up.

385
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,020
Rym: So this tablet revolution I think is going to come back real in the next years.

386
00:22:19,482 --> 00:22:27,332
Rym: The lockdown OS prevents them from fucking the shit up but at the same time Such they'll be locked into a hardware upgrade cycle.

387
00:22:27,392 --> 00:22:29,239
Rym: That is more rapid than they were before.

388
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:35,525
Rym: They're gonna have a weak laptop or a weak tablet a year later one That's twice as fast comes out.

389
00:22:35,867 --> 00:22:37,432
Rym: and because their old one is slow.

390
00:22:37,453 --> 00:22:42,620
Rym: I mean even Android might my phone Slightly sluggish if I use some of the advanced stuff.

391
00:22:42,724 --> 00:22:48,540
Scott: Yeah I needed to upgrade my iPhone 4 which is still otherwise Unserviceable to iPhone 5 so that I could play Super Hexagon.

392
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:53,660
Rym: So there's a lot of concerns around this but the moral is that desktop Linux is having some trouble.

393
00:22:53,881 --> 00:22:55,208
Scott: Well, when is it not had trouble?

394
00:22:55,308 --> 00:22:56,233
Scott: more so than ever.

395
00:22:56,273 --> 00:23:03,800
Scott: but I think it's looking promising Even though Ubuntu is doing stupid shit into simply because everyone else is just abandoning even fighting them.

396
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,333
Scott: It's like, you know, they just sort of Linux just sort of hang in there.

397
00:23:07,634 --> 00:23:09,140
Scott: Yeah kept being the loser.

398
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,371
Scott: It'd be like if every team quit the NFL except the Cleveland Browns.

399
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,153
Scott: They'd be like Super Bowl.

400
00:23:13,214 --> 00:23:13,494
Rym: Yes.

401
00:23:13,595 --> 00:23:13,996
Rym: Yes.

402
00:23:14,237 --> 00:23:14,919
Scott: That's what it's like.

403
00:23:21,271 --> 00:23:29,570
Rym: But anyway things of the day We talked about on an episode we recorded that has not aired yet about pre-hoc and post-hoc trash talk.

404
00:23:30,152 --> 00:23:32,178
Rym: So I am now right now 645 p.m.

405
00:23:32,218 --> 00:23:33,262
Rym: Dateline Guy Fawkes day.

406
00:23:33,523 --> 00:23:38,044
Rym: I am going to pre-hoc trash talk.

407
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:40,997
Rym: the 2012 presidential election.

408
00:23:41,037 --> 00:23:56,879
Rym: my thing of the day is a video from last year When Obama won or last year last election four years ago when Obama won and it is get your war On which is a they do kind of good funny Rotoscoped animations about politics.

409
00:23:57,421 --> 00:24:02,430
Rym: It's kind of like a webcomic but in YouTube form and They have one of the funniest videos ever.

410
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:06,730
Rym: This is the kind of thing that tomorrow when Obama wins the election one of the funniest videos ever.

411
00:24:06,911 --> 00:24:07,754
Rym: No, but tomorrow.

412
00:24:07,855 --> 00:24:09,120
Rym: this is funny in one context.

413
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:18,550
Rym: tomorrow when Obama wins the election You mail this a link to this to your scary conservative aunt or Scott Johnson's dad.

414
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:24,049
Rym: That is what you do, okay, it's pretty funny - mostly the whole - cheeky thing.

415
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:27,179
Rym: Yeah, so everybody knows whatever scares you the most.

416
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,565
Scott: it's football time and everybody knows it.

417
00:24:29,606 --> 00:24:31,150
Scott: nerds even nerds.

418
00:24:31,331 --> 00:24:32,173
Scott: You don't like football.

419
00:24:32,715 --> 00:24:45,290
Scott: no Tecmo Bowl and Tecmo Bowl is in fact in my opinion the most fun Football related video game ever made especially Tecmo Super Bowl, right and the also not so often noticed super Tecmo Bowl.

420
00:24:45,892 --> 00:24:52,490
Scott: Yeah, the Super Nintendo, but anyway Tecmo Super Bowl everybody knows that there's some guys out there Who are so into Tecmo Super Bowl that every year?

421
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,849
Scott: They update the rosters of all the teams and they have all these ROM hacks.

422
00:24:56,332 --> 00:24:59,365
Scott: So you can play updated Tecmo Super Bowl all the time.

423
00:24:59,646 --> 00:25:00,269
Scott: It's pretty great.

424
00:25:01,372 --> 00:25:03,884
Scott: So the website for that is actually Tecmo Bowl org.

425
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:04,769
Scott: I just learned that.

426
00:25:05,675 --> 00:25:20,530
Scott: but more importantly my thing of the day is that NFL Films, you know the pretty much the reason the NFL is popular made a Documentary about Tecmo Super Bowl that already aired on ESPN 2 and the NFL Network a bunch of times.

427
00:25:20,911 --> 00:25:25,302
Scott: But I'm sure if you wanted to you could find it somewhere to watch it.

428
00:25:25,322 --> 00:25:27,648
Scott: So I'm linking to Tecmo Bowl org.

429
00:25:29,332 --> 00:25:32,649
Scott: Actually, I'll link to the post about this documentary on Tecmo Bowl org.

430
00:25:33,251 --> 00:25:47,607
Scott: But yeah, you should go and watch this documentary because they interview all the guys, you know, who are always You know hacking the game and playing in Tecmo Bowl tournaments and all that kind of stuff and It is pretty cool.

431
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:51,600
Rym: So in the meta moment, we're gonna be at magfest.

432
00:25:51,881 --> 00:25:52,524
Rym: fucking shit up.

433
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,190
Scott: That is a long-ass time for now.

434
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,422
Rym: Oh, it's November.

435
00:25:55,442 --> 00:25:59,361
Rym: So Two months from now not that far long time.

436
00:25:59,582 --> 00:26:00,606
Rym: We're gonna be at PAX East.

437
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:01,710
Rym: We're gonna be at PAX Australia.

438
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:07,617
Rym: We're gonna be at Anime Boston and And Connecticut in July, that's right.

439
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,325
Rym: Actually Connecticut is slightly before PAX Australia.

440
00:26:10,345 --> 00:26:14,943
Scott: Okay, the book club book is still The name of the wind which now I know.

441
00:26:15,184 --> 00:26:16,270
Scott: yes, you know the name of the way.

442
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,916
Rym: It's like not to spoil.

443
00:26:17,936 --> 00:26:23,258
Rym: but there's a point in the book where someone's like say this word I'm like, oh that's the name of the wind.

444
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:26,451
Rym: and they're like, yes, that is the name of the wind that word right there Mm-hmm.

445
00:26:26,732 --> 00:26:27,676
Rym: It was just there it is.

446
00:26:27,897 --> 00:26:28,438
Rym: I can say it.

447
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,630
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, the name of the wind is the book.

448
00:26:32,954 --> 00:26:35,130
Scott: I guess Rym finished it cuz he knows the name of the wind.

449
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:37,761
Scott: So we'll be talking about that relatively soon.

450
00:26:37,781 --> 00:26:41,675
Scott: and then Rym will pick something else probably awful Probably the Great Gatsby.

451
00:26:41,936 --> 00:26:44,204
Rym: great because I want to read it before that movie comes out.

452
00:26:44,505 --> 00:26:45,889
Rym: great supposedly a good book.

453
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,109
Rym: Or I could pick the second book in the name of the wind.

454
00:26:51,212 --> 00:26:51,896
Scott: I'm gonna read it.

455
00:26:52,097 --> 00:26:52,539
Scott: I bought it.

456
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:57,123
Rym: I have it sitting there cuz granted I got a tired of some of the Harry Potter crap that happened.

457
00:26:57,164 --> 00:27:04,273
Scott: But otherwise You always like reviewing the book club book before the episode These goddamn books.

458
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:07,302
Scott: I don't think any of that amount of tantalizing is gonna help.

459
00:27:07,783 --> 00:27:08,585
Rym: It's a pretty good book.

460
00:27:08,946 --> 00:27:11,458
Scott: Anyway, uh Any other met?

461
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:13,070
Scott: Oh, I sent out the newsletter today.

462
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:17,190
Scott: Yeah I think I fixed the problem where the text version is not screwed up.

463
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:21,490
Scott: Apparently there's a button you have to click to update the text version after you edit the HTML version.

464
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:23,503
Scott: Well, why do I have to click that button?

465
00:27:23,543 --> 00:27:23,805
Scott: Seriously?

466
00:27:23,825 --> 00:27:24,529
Scott: It should be automatic.

467
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,537
Scott: But Yeah, I said the newsletter.

468
00:27:27,738 --> 00:27:32,058

Scott: how soon would that be?

483
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,199
Rym: How many days?

484
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:00,668
Rym: I don't remember?

485
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,195
Scott: You don't remember how many days it is.

486
00:28:03,295 --> 00:28:04,379
Rym: No, I guess I told you it was five days.

487
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:12,018
Rym: Oh Well, I am drinking Applejack as we speak.

488
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:12,780
Scott: that's what is it.

489
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,129
Scott: was it pony countdown calm or something up pony?

490

Scott: Pony countdown calm.

Scott: I still get four days 15 hours 9 minutes and 40 something seconds.

492
00:28:24,784 --> 00:28:25,766
Scott: I was recording.

493
00:28:26,067 --> 00:28:39,210
Rym: I get more Correspondence about fucking radio free equestria where we did like 13 episodes that I get about anything else I've ever done in my life except for Pony countdown just because.

494
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:42,585
Rym: But yeah for all of you who bother me all the time about that.

495
00:28:42,645 --> 00:28:43,650
Rym: Yes, we're doing it.

496
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:55,279
Rym: We're starting a season of it in Four days and 15. well 15 hours plus the length of one episode plus however long it takes us to record an episode And put it online which is pretty quick.

497
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:55,439
Rym: Now.

498
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:56,906
Rym: I actually streamlined my process.

499
00:28:56,926 --> 00:29:02,649
Rym: Okay, so Let's So hit relay chat.

500
00:29:03,353 --> 00:29:05,521
Scott: Yeah, we're supposed to do an episode on this.

501
00:29:05,883 --> 00:29:10,082
Scott: So I'll admit the idea we got so Way way back in the day.

502
00:29:10,103 --> 00:29:11,470
Rym: I was really big.

503
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,939
Rym: I gotta get away from this pony countdown because I'm just staring at it.

504
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:14,601
Rym: Mm-hmm.

505
00:29:15,063 --> 00:29:16,047
Rym: It's a long time ago.

506
00:29:16,067 --> 00:29:20,878
Rym: I Wanted to get on the internet And I didn't know how.

507
00:29:21,782 --> 00:29:24,694
Rym: we had prodigy classic Mm-hmm there.

508
00:29:24,734 --> 00:29:28,789
Rym: you couldn't get on the internet from there and I didn't know what the internet was.

509
00:29:29,832 --> 00:29:34,106
Rym: So I remember trying to get went to the library and tried to find books on the internet and I start.

510
00:29:34,146 --> 00:29:43,401
Rym: I vaguely learned about ISPs and ARPANET, but I couldn't quite figure it out and I'd log into like BBS's and chat with people and all this stuff.

511
00:29:44,144 --> 00:29:47,830
Rym: I didn't ever actually use IRC Until I was in high school.

512
00:29:48,632 --> 00:29:50,298
Rym: All right, I didn't use it that much.

513
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:56,779
Rym: Okay, because I by the time I learned about IRC and started using it I already had ICQ which 100% replaced it for me.

514
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:03,670
Rym: Yeah, I Used IRC more in RIT than I used it at any other place in my entire life.

515
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,655
Scott: I keep using.

516
00:30:04,715 --> 00:30:07,430
Scott: my use of IRC is increase decrease increase decrease.

517
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,381
Scott: It goes up and down back and forth back and forth.

518
00:30:09,421 --> 00:30:21,105
Scott: All right, but basically, you know back in the day I was much like you You know, I learned internetting Actually learned HTMLs before I had internets at my house at summer camp.

519
00:30:21,126 --> 00:30:22,370
Scott: I learned the HTMLs at Netscape.

520
00:30:22,574 --> 00:30:23,390
Rym: I was in the same boat.

521
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:28,030
Rym: I was in middle school and a guy was like I learned how to program and I was like what right?

522
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:29,378
Scott: So anyway, I went.

523
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:33,459
Scott: you know when I got AOL's at my house I wanted to use Netscape instead of this.

524
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:36,390
Scott: I knew that this browser and AOL was no good, you know.

525
00:30:36,912 --> 00:30:40,590
Scott: So I learned you could run nets you could minimize AOL and just open up Netscape.

526
00:30:40,771 --> 00:30:41,996
Rym: See, I never used AOL.

527
00:30:42,056 --> 00:30:45,490
Rym: So I went straight from Prodigy to oh my god fucking internet.

528
00:30:45,784 --> 00:30:47,224
Scott: Yeah Then I had it fucking internet.

529
00:30:47,285 --> 00:30:52,650
Scott: after that I just had to dial up into the local phone company up when I had my own computer upstairs.

530
00:30:52,871 --> 00:30:55,379
Scott: But anyway, you know once I learned you could do that.

531
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:58,690
Scott: I was like, hey, are there other programs that you can just run to?

532
00:30:58,890 --> 00:30:59,386
Scott: Use the Internet.

533
00:31:01,315 --> 00:31:07,246
Scott: So, of course, you know, I was using the chats inside of AOL But they were sort of very restricted by AOL.

534
00:31:08,611 --> 00:31:14,350
Scott: So I discovered IRC and I was like, oh you get this M IRC program and look at all these chats about things.

535
00:31:14,592 --> 00:31:14,733
Scott: Now

536
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:32,762
Rym: even as late as when we were in high school it's interesting because IRC and Usenet were two there are things now that the only people who really know about them and use them to this day are really old people usually with beards or Young punk kids who are in the like darknet of like super piracy

537
00:31:32,923 --> 00:31:34,186
Scott: or super tech people

538
00:31:34,427 --> 00:31:35,450
Rym: or child pornographers.

539
00:31:35,751 --> 00:31:38,019
Scott: Yeah, people in the who doing dark evil things.

540
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,400
Scott: Yes.

541
00:31:38,902 --> 00:31:50,441
Rym: So even as late as when we were in high school IRC and Usenet still worked the way they were intended to a large degree Yep, but then they were ruined by things we'll talk about.

542
00:31:50,481 --> 00:31:52,490
Scott: Well IRC mostly works the way as its intended.

543
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,421
Scott: Yeah, well the thing is bad news groups not as much.

544
00:31:55,502 --> 00:32:02,448
Scott: but some news groups still do especially like the Academic ones that you know, people are still on like comp Lang something something.

545
00:32:02,468 --> 00:32:07,201
Scott: this, you know If you're at a university that still has a news group server You can use that the old-school way you can.

546
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:12,221
Rym: but the problem with IRC Just talk about IRC not get into the additional problems of BBS's.

547
00:32:12,261 --> 00:32:14,810
Rym: Yeah, and Usenet was that let's do using this.

548
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:25,866
Rym: Yeah So the way IRC works in the same way email does in that it was designed in an era when no one really Considered the possibilities of things like spam.

549
00:32:26,148 --> 00:32:29,462
Rym: Yeah It was just all right, I'm gonna run an IRC server.

550
00:32:29,502 --> 00:32:31,651
Rym: Hey Scott you run an IRC server - I'll tell you what Let's.

551
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:33,237
Rym: uh, let's join our server.

552
00:32:33,277 --> 00:32:36,770
Rym: So all my channels show up on yours and vice versa and all our users can just chat.

553
00:32:37,352 --> 00:32:42,670
Scott: Yeah, I mean who wants to connect to a server so far away where there's gonna be this big-ass delay, right?

554
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:43,212
Scott: Why would we?

555
00:32:43,533 --> 00:32:50,682
Scott: you know that that's so annoying and if you want to chat with someone on one server and also chat with Someone on another server that kind of sucks is nice.

556
00:32:50,742 --> 00:32:52,770
Scott: I suddenly have you're from your local computer.

557
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,461
Scott: You have to connect to all these different servers.

558
00:32:54,521 --> 00:32:55,367
Scott: that fucking sucks.

559
00:32:55,427 --> 00:33:01,330
Scott: instead Everyone can connect to one server right the one closest to them and join any channel.

560
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,877
Scott: They want to talk to anyone they want.

561
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:13,830
Scott: and if there's anyone who you want to talk to someone who's on it You know connected to a different server the servers will talk to each other, you know And no one needs to make these, you know multiple connections in their house clogging up the whole internet.

562
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:14,878
Rym: So there were big like.

563
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:16,330
Rym: there were semi-private.

564
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,537
Rym: IRC is like there were completely cordoned off.

565
00:33:18,678 --> 00:33:23,516
Rym: IRC is like chunks of servers that would talk together and they have their own rules their Culture their own whatever.

566
00:33:23,978 --> 00:33:33,630
Rym: but there are also a very large kind of Universal IRC networks the XM alternate server F net alternate down that there's basically big groups of IRC servers.

567
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,034
Scott: They have servers all over the world.

568
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:39,005
Scott: Yeah, and they all those servers are basically effectively the same server.

569
00:33:39,487 --> 00:33:42,815
Scott: you connect to them and You see every channel.

570
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:47,290
Scott: that's on every one of those servers with every user and you can join any channel and talk to anyone.

571
00:33:47,531 --> 00:33:48,173
Rym: Now think about that.

572
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:58,370
Rym: think of it how hard it is for example in the modern internet to ban One person from a network like that where all these servers are completely federated.

573
00:33:58,571 --> 00:34:00,077
Rym: I'm running an IRC server.

574
00:34:00,378 --> 00:34:02,225
Rym: if the network trusts me it trusts me.

575
00:34:02,245 --> 00:34:06,230
Scott: Yep You have to send that ban to every single server.

576
00:34:06,331 --> 00:34:07,803
Scott: So they all know that you're banned.

577
00:34:07,883 --> 00:34:08,690
Rym: and even then what do you ban?

578
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,637
Rym: You can just change your nickname all the time.

579
00:34:10,657 --> 00:34:12,603
Rym: You gotta ban some fucking IPs.

580
00:34:12,744 --> 00:34:15,318
Scott: I change which IP I'm coming from Cuz I use a VPN.

581
00:34:15,438 --> 00:34:16,969
Rym: now I get a ban entire net mask.

582
00:34:17,331 --> 00:34:18,637
Scott: But now I'm using a VPN.

583
00:34:18,658 --> 00:34:21,170
Scott: the tons of other people are using cuz it's like some.

584
00:34:21,853 --> 00:34:23,081
Scott: It's you know, it's one of those tour things.

585
00:34:23,101 --> 00:34:24,168
Scott: You can't ban it the whole thing.

586
00:34:24,248 --> 00:34:25,875
Rym: Yep Well, you can maybe in some.

587
00:34:25,935 --> 00:34:27,320
Rym: so now look at this problem.

588
00:34:27,621 --> 00:34:33,103
Rym: to have a relatively usable IRC network Maybe you just fucking ban all those services.

589
00:34:33,143 --> 00:34:37,938
Scott: never very restrictive No, instead what people do is they just let IRC go nuts.

590
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,409
Rym: Yeah, the thing is IRC was always this kind of Wild West place.

591
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:50,118
Rym: I mean the when I was hanging out in IRC when I would idle in high school, which basically IRC is the Idle relay protocol.

592
00:34:50,138 --> 00:34:50,880
Rym: Well, it's so weird.

593
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:56,040
Scott: right back in those days those 90s and you chatted You turned your computer on you dialed in first of all.

594
00:34:56,141 --> 00:34:58,750
Scott: Yep, you would open the chat and you would be looking at it.

595
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:03,384
Scott: That's all you would be doing is looking at the chat and chatting Occasionally, I'd be especially leaves.

596
00:35:03,424 --> 00:35:06,690
Rym: at the same time I'd be like chatting with my magic friends in the magic room.

597
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,185
Scott: Maybe such a limit you a lot of role-playing chats would happen.

598
00:35:09,205 --> 00:35:10,090
Scott: I guess those still happen.

599
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:12,158
Rym: I did a lot of that a lot of Forgotten Realms rope.

600
00:35:12,218 --> 00:35:14,165
Rym: I'm sorry for God hidden items.

601
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:14,988
Rym: Correct.

602
00:35:15,008 --> 00:35:18,097
Scott: That's correct Okay, but nowadays people don't do that, right?

603
00:35:18,578 --> 00:35:20,082
Scott: But what do people do?

604
00:35:20,143 --> 00:35:25,439
Scott: Well, in fact, you know, I've said this before nowadays We're talking 10 years ago - yeah, alrighty.

605
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:33,203
Scott: Well, but I'm saying is that nowadays people Sort of Twitter in my eyes has replaced the need of IRC, right?

606
00:35:33,303 --> 00:35:35,470
Scott: It's you don't have to pay attention to all the time.

607
00:35:35,711 --> 00:35:40,130
Scott: It's basically Twitter is one big chat room and the whole world is in the chat room.

608
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:47,150
Rym: Well, but I'm really in a chat room that consists of the list of all the people on subscribe But by default everyone is on mute.

609
00:35:47,351 --> 00:35:54,429
Scott: So you basically join this chat room with everyone in the world in it and they're all on mute and then you unmute Individual people and that's Twitter, right?

610
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:56,516
Scott: So what IRC is?

611
00:35:56,697 --> 00:35:57,100
Scott: basically?

612
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,850
Scott: everyone is not on mute by default.

613
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:02,470
Scott: But you go into a channel that doesn't have everyone in the world, you know, you go through the channel.

614
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:14,070
Scott: There's a few people who care about the same thing you care about And that, you know, but usually what happens is, you know, you go to a channel But the people in that channel, they're in there, but they're not at the computer right now.

615
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:16,441
Scott: They're doing something else like browsing the web or playing a game.

616
00:36:16,462 --> 00:36:18,170
Scott: They just want to hang out in the channel.

617
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:20,330
Scott: So everyone's hanging out, but not saying anything.

618
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:23,370
Scott: But then if you need to say something you go in there and say it and there's no response.

619
00:36:24,411 --> 00:36:26,401
Scott: But then later someone might come and look and notice.

620
00:36:26,762 --> 00:36:28,330
Scott: Oh, someone said something and then respond.

621
00:36:28,713 --> 00:36:29,299
Rym: You got to idle.

622
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,449
Rym: You got to just hang out in the room.

623
00:36:30,651 --> 00:36:33,830
Scott: Yeah, if you don't hang out in there, you might miss when someone says something, right?

624
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:38,290
Scott: So now the way people use IRC is so messed up is now it's interesting.

625
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:38,853
Rym: You know talk about.

626
00:36:39,014 --> 00:36:39,798
Rym: I like old.

627
00:36:39,879 --> 00:36:43,397
Rym: I am the reason I hated AOL so much was that ICQ did a lot of that stuff.

628
00:36:43,417 --> 00:36:46,350
Rym: like ICQ I could send messages to people who weren't online.

629
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:52,410
Rym: No I could start a chat room that people will come and go and I actually once ICQ really caught on I use that.

630
00:36:52,932 --> 00:36:57,970
Rym: For I've spawned chat rooms and have 20 people in them all the time and I basically stopped using IRC.

631
00:36:59,132 --> 00:37:08,287
Scott: Yeah, so but I see had other features You know that are Like like wars of like trying to flood someone out of a channel or bots and things crazy.

632
00:37:08,387 --> 00:37:09,290
Rym: net split bullshit.

633
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:12,486
Rym: We're suddenly the channel like splits in two because the network had a problem.

634
00:37:12,687 --> 00:37:13,290
Scott: Yeah that yeah.

635
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:14,597
Scott: Well, so a net split right.

636
00:37:14,638 --> 00:37:16,026
Scott: we said an IRC is when there's.

637
00:37:16,429 --> 00:37:18,329
Scott: you know You have all these servers that are all part of the same net.

638
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:23,990
Rym: Yeah, say I'm connected to my own IRC server that I run connected to alternate and my servers trusted alternate.

639
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:25,330
Rym: So we're chatting with each other.

640
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:26,335
Rym: There's much people in the room.

641
00:37:26,998 --> 00:37:29,710
Rym: say my server loses its upstream connection to alternate.

642
00:37:30,171 --> 00:37:42,250
Rym: Well, suddenly I'm still in my room with all the people who are connected to my server and all the servers connected to me in The tree up to the point where I lost the connection and Scott's connected to alternate with all those people.

643
00:37:42,634 --> 00:37:47,723
Rym: So we're both in the same room but we see a different list of people and we see we're talking you.

644
00:37:47,764 --> 00:37:53,746
Scott: they can't see what I'm saying and he can't see what He's saying because we're separated and then eventually when the internet comes back We'll be reconnected.

645
00:37:53,807 --> 00:38:02,510
Rym: now Woe betide when like the the op in the room gets split away and then like someone else Abuses op to fuck up the room and then the rooms recombine.

646
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:17,610
Scott: Yeah, I are see, you know, unlike other chats has this sort of inherent structure of you know controlling the room being the operator You know who can ban people and kick people and set the title and yeah all the and gets all these privileges and setting who?

647
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:25,034
Rym: Has which caused a weird sort of social structure where like the people who had that little plus next to the name were just they Were the nobility they were better people.

648
00:38:25,074 --> 00:38:37,956
Scott: Yeah, there's the you know, the the technology of how the rooms are managed, you know sort of you know Created this social structure around it that matched, you know It wasn't the other way around.

649
00:38:37,996 --> 00:38:46,250
Scott: like we come up with the social structure we want and then we make the technology fit that They just sort of made this technology chance serve listserv stuff to manage.

650
00:38:46,692 --> 00:38:57,650
Scott: you know who's in what rooms who controls the rooms and channels and From that came how you have to manage an IRC which is annoying because you really have no other choice.

651
00:38:57,771 --> 00:38:58,293
Scott: It's not like.

652
00:38:58,655 --> 00:39:01,850
Scott: if you don't like the way PHP BB does it you can switch and use vanilla.

653
00:39:02,031 --> 00:39:02,933
Scott: It's like this IRC.

654
00:39:02,953 --> 00:39:08,250
Scott: in this IRC, you know, you can't switch to some other non IRC thing that does it differently.

655
00:39:10,211 --> 00:39:12,018
Scott: But yeah, I mean you could I guess come up with.

656
00:39:12,158 --> 00:39:15,310
Scott: you know, right your own chance or Bob but no one's gonna do that.

657
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:17,053
Scott: That's effectively part of IRC Right.

658
00:39:18,592 --> 00:39:20,618
Rym: But it's interesting that again all this culture like.

659
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:31,770
Rym: there were ways to like block people ban people deal with stuff But it was very wild Westy And if you were smart enough you could get around any ban any problem.

660
00:39:32,092 --> 00:39:34,410
Rym: You can always get in and fuck shit up and flood people.

661
00:39:35,132 --> 00:39:40,989
Rym: There was no way to prevent it and that's why protocols like this like email the idea of spam is a problem because email

662
00:39:41,009 --> 00:39:41,049
Scott: is

663
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:52,566
Rym: A very similar system by my email server has to trust any email it gets And the best we can do is rely on blacklists and like heuristic searches and things to identify spam.

664
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:56,418
Rym: There's no sort of Inherent rate limiting in the protocol.

665
00:39:56,899 --> 00:40:01,974
Rym: meanwhile AOL instant messenger being a sort of private proprietary thing Had that rate limit.

666
00:40:01,994 --> 00:40:06,330
Rym: if I chat at you too much and you're not responding Maya eventually won't let me chat at you anymore.

667
00:40:06,852 --> 00:40:08,678
Scott: Yeah, well, you're only connecting to the AOL server.

668
00:40:08,718 --> 00:40:10,263
Rym: It knows they control everything.

669
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:12,190
Scott: Yeah, well, there's so many servers, right?

670
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,397
Scott: You can hit each one once.

671
00:40:13,417 --> 00:40:16,654
Rym: this is the power of IRC You can have this.

672
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:18,941
Rym: IRC is really useful in my opinion.

673
00:40:18,981 --> 00:40:27,929
Rym: nowadays along with BBS is for subverting Bad governments getting information around barriers and sharing things that are difficult or illegal to share.

674
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,221
Scott: Yeah Well, it's so weird right.

675
00:40:29,262 --> 00:40:35,650
Scott: on the one hand There's nothing about IRC that makes it any more or less secure than web or anything like right?

676
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:39,270
Scott: It's just you're sending text over your internet wire, you know.

677
00:40:39,591 --> 00:40:42,930
Scott: You could put encryption or some sort of tunnel on it with some other technology.

678
00:40:43,412 --> 00:40:45,559
Scott: But now I mean, it's no different than the web.

679
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:48,910
Scott: It's just a different protocol of bits going over TCP IP.

680
00:40:49,351 --> 00:40:52,083
Rym: There's just so much going on and it's such a distributed structure.

681
00:40:52,143 --> 00:40:53,570
Rym: It's very hard to police it.

682
00:40:53,770 --> 00:41:00,089
Scott: Yeah, and the real big thing is that it's you know, most people when they use the internet quote, right?

683
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:08,630
Scott: All the only applications that they really use on there, you know locally are the web browser, you know Almost 90% of everything is in the web browser.

684
00:41:09,531 --> 00:41:12,278
Scott: Maybe they have a desktop email client like outlook.

685
00:41:12,819 --> 00:41:15,567
Scott: Maybe something like iTunes will use some internet, right?

686
00:41:15,867 --> 00:41:16,509
Scott: That's pretty much it.

687
00:41:18,095 --> 00:41:30,539
Scott: so all these other applications that are internet protocols It's like just because the fact that most people don't know about them or use them Sort of makes them hidden from the public.

688
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:37,988
Scott: just because they're not something that people know about You can just download them and use them for free no problem.

689
00:41:38,089 --> 00:41:44,850
Rym: this day I have access to an internal IBM like straight-up listserv and there's just awesome tech discussions in there.

690
00:41:46,274 --> 00:41:49,970
Scott: But it's like people just don't know about listserv so much except tech people.

691
00:41:50,052 --> 00:41:50,284
Scott: Yeah.

692
00:41:50,470 --> 00:42:01,785
Scott: So that whole part of the internet is super hidden away just by the nature of its obscurity and inaccessibility user interface and marketing which at the same time lends it a sort of mystique.

693
00:42:01,825 --> 00:42:18,019
Rym: which is why I think like our own IRC channel is actually pretty popular and people nerds who use IRC because it's kind of this cool thing like the Super mundane people will never use IRC yeah, but the kind of slightly more hip people on the internet will use it because it's kind of a status symbol.

694
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:29,469
Rym: and Once you're in IRC, it's interesting how the culture of IRC use Seems to have like like I know I've seen people hanging out in these chat rooms who clearly never used IRC in the 90s.

695
00:42:31,154 --> 00:42:36,359
Rym: And yet they sort of Rediscover the same culture the the it's.

696
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,864
Rym: we did that lecture.

697
00:42:37,904 --> 00:42:46,367
Rym: the game makes the community the medium Makes the community in this case IRC community sort of forms the same way no matter who's using it.

698
00:42:46,608 --> 00:42:46,728
Rym: Mm-hmm.

699
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:47,952
Scott: Yeah, it's just.

700
00:42:48,052 --> 00:42:55,114
Scott: you know, there's a whole bunch of things like this, you know news groups also how because it's you know Hidden quote hidden.

701
00:42:55,175 --> 00:42:57,282
Scott: It's not actually hidden, but it's just not.

702
00:42:57,643 --> 00:43:04,090
Scott: you know, it doesn't put itself out there marketing wise And it doesn't put itself out there user interface like the hole-in-the-wall restaurant that no one knows about right?

703
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:10,143
Scott: It's like you have to know about it You have to learn how to use it and you have to Intentionally go do it to get in there.

704
00:43:10,425 --> 00:43:20,347
Rym: that when you're using it You sort of get this false feeling that you're in a hidden secret place And as you learn the details like once you realize that you change your nickname you start learning those slash commands.

705
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:21,130
Rym: you get this.

706
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:22,470
Rym: Not necessarily false.

707
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:32,170
Rym: But you get this sense of accomplishment that you've learned an archaic skill Much like how people use those fucking Bloomberg terminals feel really proud of themselves that they know how to use that terrible UI.

708
00:43:33,834 --> 00:43:41,190
Scott: So what you get is you get you know Pretty much you get free node where open source people chat about their open source projects.

709
00:43:41,311 --> 00:43:43,241
Scott: You get like, you know channels for Ubuntu.

710
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:56,655
Scott: pretty much every open source project the universe has a channel on free node and what they use it for is You know Usually the overall discussion on an open source project is gonna happen on a news group newsletter Not a news group a newsletter.

711
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:57,438
Scott: Yeah, right.

712
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,850
Scott: or listserv and they might have a forum somewhere.

713
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:03,843
Scott: Maybe they might have a bug tracker which has certain things.

714
00:44:04,205 --> 00:44:09,102
Scott: but the IRC is Usually gonna be where you know, the real-time action happens.

715
00:44:09,122 --> 00:44:09,865
Scott: You have a problem.

716
00:44:09,885 --> 00:44:11,250
Scott: You need to get the answer right now.

717
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:12,479
Scott: You couldn't find it on Google.

718
00:44:12,499 --> 00:44:13,205
Scott: You couldn't wait for it.

719
00:44:13,285 --> 00:44:15,777
Scott: on Stack Exchange You go to the IRC channel for the thing.

720
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:22,650
Scott: you are the developers who actually work on the thing You know need to discuss and it's too slow for them to discuss in forums.

721
00:44:22,792 --> 00:44:34,030
Scott: So they're always in the dev IRCs the big Ubuntu Ubuntu dev separate channel for the people who work on Ubuntu sitting in there hanging out talking about stuff You know because there's too many of them to use like an I am conversation.

722
00:44:34,731 --> 00:44:36,897
Scott: Yeah, right You need to talk to all these people at once.

723
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:39,930
Scott: you're on some sort of team that needs to real-time communicate with each other.

724
00:44:40,431 --> 00:44:47,090
Scott: All right, and these are the things that IRC still does and there really aren't any other chats out there.

725
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:49,804
Scott: You know the the I am protocols that are there.

726
00:44:49,925 --> 00:44:50,750
Rym: They're too ephemeral.

727
00:44:51,011 --> 00:44:53,743
Scott: You see anyone using G chat to have a real-time chat?

728
00:44:54,104 --> 00:44:56,653
Rym: I do but again Right.

729
00:44:56,693 --> 00:45:01,130
Rym: Yeah, I do often but it's very ephemeral and it lacks a lot of.

730
00:45:02,172 --> 00:45:05,585
Scott: Yeah, you could use hangout but hangouts got like this video chat on it.

731
00:45:05,625 --> 00:45:06,750
Scott: that's like when you start a hangout.

732
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:10,330
Scott: That's a temporary, you know thing that's gonna have a start and an end time.

733
00:45:10,752 --> 00:45:16,519
Scott: It's like for a meeting and IRC is like an always-on You know discussion between multiple people's.

734
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,563
Scott: it's logged.

735
00:45:17,783 --> 00:45:19,730
Scott: There's bots to do helpful things in there.

736
00:45:20,631 --> 00:45:23,060
Scott: Right, you know and it's this really.

737
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:26,050
Scott: nothing else has been able to compete with it in any way.

738
00:45:26,251 --> 00:45:32,529
Scott: And even if you did make something that all the features but how to use their interface is accessible Perhaps web-based perhaps a nice application.

739
00:45:33,312 --> 00:45:35,540
Scott: There's so much already in IRC.

740
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:41,582
Scott: You couldn't get people to you know bail out of it Especially, you know with that network aspect.

741
00:45:41,622 --> 00:45:54,690
Scott: That's really the thing is that you know You're you sign up you connect to this IRC network to join You know free node and you're always connected to the KDE channel because you're in the KDE community, right?

742
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:57,096
Scott: Well, you're already connected to freenode all the time.

743
00:45:57,116 --> 00:46:05,543
Scott: And now you have a question for someone who works on I don't know Firefox, I guess the Firefox channels also on freenode.

744
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:07,650
Scott: I think they have a Mozilla one.

745
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:13,310
Scott: It's separate but you know the channel for the other open source project you need to question about is also on freenode.

746
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:14,816
Scott: so you're already on there too.

747
00:46:14,936 --> 00:46:18,369
Scott: and now you're in two channels all the time and it just spreads like that.

748
00:46:18,389 --> 00:46:26,470
Scott: and You know, you you would have to literally bring every single channel off of every IRC network to put any dent in that.

749
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,892
Scott: It's probably gonna hang around Forever.

750
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:38,202
Scott: Yeah, and as long as TCP IP is used and I think the culture is going to Persevere through all of that time as long as this Internet's is gonna be IRC.

751
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:41,030
Scott: So it it might be worth your time.

752
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:42,278
Scott: I mean, I you know, I used it.

753
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:42,882
Scott: I didn't use it.

754
00:46:42,922 --> 00:46:43,244
Scott: I use it.

755
00:46:43,305 --> 00:46:43,808
Scott: I didn't use it.

756
00:46:44,413 --> 00:46:56,569
Scott: You know, sometimes I went in there to get files You know in the sort of dark ages of peer-to-peer like after Napster died But before BitTorrent came out I was using IRC to get animes and things like that.

757
00:46:57,533 --> 00:47:04,176
Scott: But now, you know, some people still say IRC is the best place to get stuff Because people don't always make torrents of everything.

758
00:47:04,256 --> 00:47:11,435
Scott: but you know the fansubbers themselves run the IRC channels where you can get everything But they're usually ops.

759
00:47:11,956 --> 00:47:13,460
Rym: so you have to get in there.

760
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:17,345
Scott: good grace and then people ability and then people do weird stuff like they'll have.

761
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:20,265
Scott: You know, they'll have like ratios like you have to.

762
00:47:20,628 --> 00:47:22,316
Scott: you know They'll have like these file servers.

763
00:47:22,436 --> 00:47:38,650
Scott: in IRC you submit files to the file server like, okay I got to upload an anime So you upload it and get credits and you can use the credits to download some other anime But you can't upload something they already got Right and you're sort of contributing to this guy's file store needed to trade files.

764
00:47:38,791 --> 00:47:41,615
Scott: Even though it's digital bits that are free I don't people trade them.

765
00:47:41,876 --> 00:47:46,636
Rym: if you're going to get an idea of what now while some of these are somewhat fabricated Remember bash.org?

766
00:47:46,817 --> 00:47:47,078
Scott: Yep.

767
00:47:47,841 --> 00:47:48,604
Rym: I'll link to it.

768
00:47:48,624 --> 00:47:50,974
Rym: Just go here and read everything on the page I'm about to link to.

769
00:47:50,994 --> 00:47:53,307
Rym: that's actually kind of what IRC is like.

770
00:47:53,548 --> 00:47:55,094
Scott: Yep So I don't know.

771
00:47:55,114 --> 00:47:57,182
Scott: there's much more we can say about IRC.

781
00:48:59,289 --> 00:49:03,929
Rym: as long as I wear this I'm able to cast the three spells simultaneously.

782
00:49:10,761 --> 00:49:12,451
Scott: Remember, this is dangerous kid.
