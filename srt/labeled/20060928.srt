10
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:49,658
Scott: It's a very important blog that pretty much everyone in the world should pay attention to.

11
00:00:49,678 --> 00:00:56,684
Rym: yeah I don't read it But the best way I found to follow boing boing is to wait for someone like Scott to link you to it Periodically.

12
00:00:56,725 --> 00:00:58,620
Scott: now for everything on boing boing is gold.

13
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,471
Scott: But they just recently started podcasting.

00:01:33,475 --> 00:01:36,525
Scott: he writes comic books He teaches at NYU.

21
00:01:36,706 --> 00:01:37,950

Scott: yeah I wish I was not as that you have.

29
00:01:53,227 --> 00:02:00,796
Rym: you have an intellectual hard-on for Douglas Rushkoff The same way that I have a creative hard-on for Neil Gaiman, I guess.

30
00:02:00,836 --> 00:02:02,783
Scott: yeah something like that He also.

31
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:05,410

Rym: Pokemon games whether you like it or not ushered in a new era of gaming.

89
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:23,467
Rym: Well, I guess internal that in terms of gaming itself, but in terms of culture around gaming Specifically the portable gaming the culture, you know The culture of Pokemon kids has a lot to do with why certain kinds of games get made today.

90
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:24,430
Scott: That is true.

91
00:07:24,932 --> 00:07:31,023
Scott: Another thing is, you know Pokemon the TV show the anime crap, whatever Magga, awesome.

92
00:07:31,063 --> 00:07:38,150

93
00:07:38,431 --> 00:07:44,850
Scott: Yes, the one and the original Pokemon games, you know the main line of Pokemon games.

97
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:06,030
Rym: I think that you missed my joke about mainline because it's like a drug all addictive.

98
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,357
Scott: I don't know what you're talking about.

99
00:08:08,558 --> 00:08:09,280
Scott: I don't get it.

100
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:10,887
Rym: Pokemon is like mainlining.

101
00:08:10,947 --> 00:08:12,232
Rym: It's the main line I don't know.

102
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:15,484
Rym: main lining is a is slang for doing intravenous drugs.

103
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:16,348
Scott: I didn't know that.

104
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,559
Scott: Wow So I chose you.

00:08:24,374 --> 00:08:24,957
Scott: Yeah, I learned.

109
00:08:25,017 --> 00:08:27,609
Scott: I learned basically everything about Pokemon over.

110
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:33,269
Scott: I read the Wikipedia and I realized I played Pokemon red and I played Pokemon silver.

111
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:41,640
Scott: and since then the only Pokemon games to come out were like these Gem, whatever ones.

112
00:08:41,702 --> 00:08:47,690
Scott: I don't forget what they're called But if I play that and then I get either diamond or pearl I'm all caught up.

113
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,192
Scott: There's only.

114
00:08:48,273 --> 00:08:51,068
Scott: I only really need to play two Pokemon games to catch up.

115
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:51,410
Rym: now.

116
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,530
Rym: I meanwhile have never played a Pokemon game ever not even in passing.

117
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:58,124
Scott: I'll lend you my a copy of Pokemon red.

118
00:08:58,164 --> 00:08:59,089
Scott: You could play in your GBA.

119
00:08:59,732 --> 00:09:03,547
Rym: Yeah, I don't want to bust the GBA out with its lack of a backlight SP.

120
00:09:03,588 --> 00:09:04,190
Scott: That's downstairs.

121
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:06,680
Rym: Oh, you mean Pete's SP that he keeps leaving at our house.

122
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:07,765
Rym: That is effectively ours.

123
00:09:07,986 --> 00:09:08,548
Scott: Yep, that one.

124
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:13,487
Rym: Okay Yeah, I'll put it right with Scott Johnson's DVD player you mean our DVD player.

125
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:17,079
Rym: that's right Yep, but no, I just I never played any Pokemon games.

126
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,390
Rym: I didn't even realize there were Pokemon games back then.

127
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:27,410
Scott: Yeah, it's basically I mean, it's an RPG with leveling So it's kind of a but really the leveling doesn't matter at all.

128
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:40,784
Scott: if you you know, if you use attacks at the right element, you know, it's all fun and games and You know, it's mostly exploring this map and talking to people and you know figuring out You know, how do I get through certain areas?

129
00:09:40,864 --> 00:09:41,629
Scott: and you know?

130
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:46,470
Scott: What trick do I have to do to get this Pokemon to come out of a tiding hole and all that kind of stuff?

131
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,442
Rym: Don't forget trying to get the ultra rare uber whatever Pokemon.

132
00:09:50,743 --> 00:09:52,690
Scott: No, that's not really necessary.

133
00:09:52,891 --> 00:10:10,282
Scott: I mean I used to put the first time I played Pokemon I did catch them all and then in the second Pokemon the silver one There were 250 Pokemon instead of 150 and I caught you know, I brought my original 150 over But there was still you know, a hundred more to get.

134
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:15,744
Scott: I didn't care about it that I just caught whatever I felt like and I used the Pokemon I cared about.

135
00:10:15,805 --> 00:10:18,998
Scott: screw all those other Pokemon And I think that's really the way.

136
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:21,870
Scott: if you want to have fun playing Pokemon if you try to catch them all.

137
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,234
Scott: It's not really that fun cuz.

138
00:10:23,274 --> 00:10:24,738
Scott: now and Pokemon diamond.

139
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:27,205

00:10:58,731 --> 00:10:59,653
Scott: What's the other one I like?

152
00:10:59,854 --> 00:11:01,137
Scott: oh the one that Adish.

153
00:11:01,538 --> 00:11:02,661
Scott: I like Adish, uh-huh.

154
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:04,065
Rym: I kind of like Togepi.

155
00:11:04,948 --> 00:11:05,690
Scott: I don't know what that is.

156
00:11:07,548 --> 00:11:09,213
Scott: and What's the other one?

157
00:11:09,254 --> 00:11:10,298
Scott: I forget which ones I like.

158
00:11:10,518 --> 00:11:10,800
Scott: I like.

159
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,783
Scott: I like a few Pokemon.

160
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:13,470
Rym: It's all about Squirtle and Bulbasaur.

161
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:18,336
Scott: Oh the guy with the swirly mouth Whatever his name is though a little known fact.

162
00:11:18,918 --> 00:11:30,830
Rym: the voice actress who did the voices of many Pokemon including if I recall correctly Bulbasaur was none other in Japan than Mikumi Hayashibara One of the most highly paid voice actresses ever.

163
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:37,250
Scott: It seems like they give her a lot of parts doing like these little tiny noises for like one second in shows.

164
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:44,338
Rym: I don't know if just because she liked doing it or if it was just a gimmick or whatever, but it's funny It is it's it's great.

165
00:11:44,378 --> 00:11:45,725
Scott: I'd like if I interviewed her.

166
00:11:45,745 --> 00:11:46,550
Scott: That's what I would ask her.

167
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:52,890
Scott: It's the only question I really need to ask her is you know Why do you do these parts and shows doing like little animal voices, you know?

168
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,564
Scott: Maybe she's just very good at it and everyone else sucks in Japan.

169
00:11:56,584 --> 00:11:56,885
Scott: I don't know.

170
00:11:56,986 --> 00:11:57,830
Rym: She is really good at it.

171
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,761
Rym: I guess though she is, you know, one of the most sought-after voice.

172
00:12:00,781 --> 00:12:03,130
Rym: that was I don't think she's been in any anime recently.

173
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,396
Scott: Yeah, I don't think anyone.

174
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,329
Scott: I think she's sort of like, you know washed up and retired.

175
00:12:07,349 --> 00:12:13,590
Rym: Yeah Well, she was super big when we first got into anime and then it kind of shifted and then Ayumi was really big.

176
00:12:13,771 --> 00:12:14,976
Rym: Well, I mean he's always been big.

177
00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:17,386
Scott: Well, Mikumi wasn't exactly the same.

178
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:18,390
Scott: She was a voice actor.

179
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,217
Scott: Well, you me is a pop star.

180
00:12:20,237 --> 00:12:21,924
Scott: Well, I'll be is like my god.

181
00:12:22,145 --> 00:12:27,310
Rym: Mikumi was a pop star Not like Madonna level but gumi was one of the big pop stars.

182
00:12:28,132 --> 00:12:29,345
Rym: Anyway, yeah.

183
00:12:29,365 --> 00:12:34,910
Rym: All right Now this was actually Scott's news and I stole it and pushed another news off because he really wanted to talk about it.

184
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:37,789
Rym: We didn't want to wait till Monday, and I don't know if you'll care or not.

185
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:43,007
Rym: But the patents the final patents on the gift image, you know, gi.

186
00:12:43,148 --> 00:12:44,953
Scott: Oh Jeff No, technically

187
00:12:45,294 --> 00:12:56,210
Rym: no because according to several studies about 70% of people in the world say gift Correct and the vast majority of human beings in America say gift

188
00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:01,850
Scott: Yes, but somehow on the official website the guy who made gift says it must be pronounced Jeff

189
00:13:02,251 --> 00:13:03,656
Rym: Yeah, now everyone

190
00:13:03,736 --> 00:13:05,121
Scott: denies him now.

191
00:13:05,281 --> 00:13:07,368
Rym: One of the reasons is that Jeff sounds kind of dumb.

192
00:13:08,212 --> 00:13:10,080
Scott: Yep, it's a name of a peanut butter brand.

193
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:14,697
Rym: Also the fact that it's an acronym for Graphics interchange format like that.

194
00:13:15,158 --> 00:13:17,484
Rym: Uh, gah, it's a plosive G.

195
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:18,728
Scott: It's not a graphics.

196
00:13:18,828 --> 00:13:21,042
Rym: It's graphics Yeah, it's not giraffes.

197
00:13:21,163 --> 00:13:21,970
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

198
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:28,890
Rym: And of course last but not least the people responsible for gift are in many ways a lot like the GNU free people.

199
00:13:29,271 --> 00:13:37,248
Rym: And in fact, I found a distinct correlation between people who say Jeff and people who are all GNU Yeah, so I guess we should start saying Jannu

200
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:40,762
Scott: Yeah,

201
00:13:40,944 --> 00:13:47,449
Rym: but anyway I'm sure many of you are actually too young to remember this story or just didn't care enough about the internet.

202
00:13:48,152 --> 00:13:50,883
Rym: Gifts were a big deal in the early days of the internet.

203
00:13:50,903 --> 00:13:52,068
Scott: They were a huge deal.

204
00:13:52,088 --> 00:14:00,988
Rym: now It was done by CompuServe but this company called Unisys did a thing that was covered by a patent that had that gift also used.

205
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:10,350
Rym: and then IBM and a bunch of other people also had patents and they all covered this thing that Pretty much everyone was using for free before all these companies started suing everybody.

206
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,829
Scott: Yeah, there was an image file format named gift and everyone was using it.

207
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:19,389
Scott: But a lot of the technology in that file format was patented by various other companies.

208
00:14:19,469 --> 00:14:22,890
Rym: now Unisys was generally rat-bastardly about it.

209
00:14:22,951 --> 00:14:30,733
Rym: But then you know They played nice a little while and then they started being really really really mean right before the year 2000.

210
00:14:30,733 --> 00:14:43,640
Rym: And to make a long story short all the patents But one have expired and now at the beginning of October coming up real soon October 1st The last patent covering gift will expire.

211
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:50,626
Rym: at that point gift and everything involved in gift are 100% free public domain to the world forever.

212
00:14:50,646 --> 00:14:52,832
Rym: Hooray This is.

213
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:58,429
Rym: it's such a rare thing that something like this happens in our day and age where something is actually for.

214
00:14:58,469 --> 00:15:00,339
Scott: patents Don't last a thousand years.

215
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,070
Scott: They last a reasonable amount of time.

216
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:12,646
Rym: The thing is the patent for gift lasted almost be it through and beyond the useful life of gift Yeah, isn't useful anymore except for animated gifs on 4chan.

217
00:15:12,807 --> 00:15:25,312
Scott: Yeah, pretty much You know, I mean it does still have its uses to make you know, very Light websites that you know can have a lot of bandwidth traffic because they are smaller than pings and JPEGs and anything else You're gonna use.

218
00:15:26,015 --> 00:15:30,150
Scott: but at the same time you really if you use a ping it's not gonna hurt you that badly.

219
00:15:30,353 --> 00:15:32,615
Scott: I mean, come on What are you worried about?

220
00:15:33,238 --> 00:15:34,986
Rym: Well alpha which doesn't work so well.

221
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:37,719
Scott: a lot of things Yeah, but that's gonna be fixed soon.

222
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:50,262
Scott: not that gif has alpha in it, yeah Yeah, that's that's the realm of JPEG and paying and whatnot, but Yeah, gift is free if does have alpha these transparent gifts.

223
00:15:50,844 --> 00:15:53,311
Rym: Oh, yeah, but it's not the same kind of thing that you can do in Ping.

224
00:15:53,331 --> 00:15:58,246
Scott: Yeah, it's only because you shrink the palette and gift but it's pretty old.

225
00:15:58,266 --> 00:15:59,550
Scott: It is pretty old.

226
00:15:59,913 --> 00:16:02,473
Rym: I mean the only real news here is that Gif is free.

227
00:16:02,493 --> 00:16:03,517
Rym: It is absolutely free.

228
00:16:03,537 --> 00:16:12,870
Scott: if you'd ever wondered what came of all that stuff because a lot of new people I think a lot of you didn't even know there was trouble concerning gift Like they just thought a gift was a different kind of file format.

229
00:16:13,346 --> 00:16:14,575
Rym: Yeah I mean I guess it was because of.

230
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:21,069
Rym: we grew up in a very specific and important era of the Internet Where all these things happened and they were big deals.

231
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:31,420
Rym: I mean there were gift versus JPEG wars while we were making websites on geocities back in the day Yeah, and nowadays no one even knows it cares.

232
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,342
Rym: people use whatever.

233
00:16:32,543 --> 00:16:35,250
Scott: yeah, so but those days are finally over.

234
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,481
Rym: Yeah, there's no more trouble with using gift.

235
00:16:38,943 --> 00:16:41,717
Scott: Yeah, and you will now see there There's a lot of software out there.

236
00:16:41,737 --> 00:16:52,153
Scott: a lot of people like wouldn't use gift, you know For one reason or another for the patent thing, but now everyone's gonna use it without any qualms and it should make life a little Bit easier.

237
00:16:52,214 --> 00:16:52,355
Rym: Yep.

238
00:16:52,536 --> 00:16:54,450
Rym: In fact, there are a whole bunch of open source programs.

239
00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:00,985
Rym: I think go script is one of them where they were actually waiting and starting October 1st They're going to release versions that support gift.

240
00:17:01,226 --> 00:17:03,579
Rym: Yeah They waited this long.

241
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:14,640
Rym: Yeah Wow Wow things of the day.

242
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:22,140
Rym: Which day today today today not do I don't know where you're going with this?

243
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,430
Rym: But I don't see a funny joke coming anywhere three day.

244
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,720
Rym: There is no joke on the horizon here at all for day.

245
00:17:29,821 --> 00:17:31,046
Rym: You're just gonna keep going with this.

246
00:17:31,487 --> 00:17:33,595
Rym: I'll just turn off your microphone one day.

247
00:17:33,615 --> 00:17:37,629
Scott: All right My thing of the day you may not know this.

248
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:41,260
Scott: In fact, I didn't really know this but there were airships.

249
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:43,667
Scott: Yeah, there were lots of them.

250
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:51,460
Scott: Yeah, like I knew that we had zeppelins But I didn't know we had airships like real airships dirigibles if you will.

251
00:17:51,741 --> 00:17:54,430
Rym: Oh, do you ever see Indiana Jones the Last Crusade?

252
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,899
Scott: Yeah, that was like a blimp, but they didn't.

253
00:17:58,102 --> 00:18:00,331
Scott: It didn't what didn't have airplanes on it.

254
00:18:00,693 --> 00:18:02,078
Rym: It had one airplane on it one.

255
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,086
Scott: It didn't have a whole bunch of them on it.

256
00:18:04,528 --> 00:18:07,519
Rym: Anyway, so I believe you're thinking today's the USS Macon.

257
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:10,149
Scott: Yes, see in 1935.

258
00:18:10,149 --> 00:18:12,136
Scott: There was this USS Macon.

259
00:18:12,296 --> 00:18:16,645
Scott: It was an airship 785 foot airship.

260
00:18:16,966 --> 00:18:18,270
Rym: now think about that for a minute.

261
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,817
Rym: that is almost last exile in proportion.

262
00:18:20,857 --> 00:18:21,760
Scott: Yeah, there's a picture of it.

263
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:28,240
Scott: you can go look at it and It had a hangar bay with four sparrowhawk biplanes.

264
00:18:28,862 --> 00:18:33,719
Scott: You know, this is a big airship with planes in it and it fell into the sea.

265
00:18:34,942 --> 00:18:46,900
Rym: See, I've always been a huge fan of airships and air pirates, but more importantly in the modern world I'm a huge fan of a lot of people who've been trying to bring back airships for intercontinental shipping.

266
00:18:47,442 --> 00:18:47,864
Scott: Yeah, they're.

267
00:18:47,964 --> 00:18:52,180
Scott: I mean you could pick up a warehouse with one of these things and fly it over the ocean real cheaply.

268
00:18:52,521 --> 00:18:59,360
Rym: Yeah, I mean imagine instead of sending, you know load stuff onto a boat send the boat over load the stuff out of trucks Send it over to the warehouse.

269
00:18:59,622 --> 00:19:02,280
Rym: You could just pick up the warehouse full of stuff from the factory.

270
00:19:02,721 --> 00:19:07,297
Rym: Take it to wherever your distribution center was put it down pick up another warehouse and take it back.

271
00:19:07,577 --> 00:19:10,384
Rym: Yep Unfortunately, pretty cool.

272
00:19:10,785 --> 00:19:18,736
Rym: The primary argument I've seen against using airships in the modern world is nothing other than What if terrorists shoot it down?

273
00:19:18,756 --> 00:19:18,816
Rym: OMG?

274
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,692
Scott: Uh They're not easy to shoot down.

275
00:19:22,712 --> 00:19:23,458
Rym: Yeah, they are.

276
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,165
Rym: Yeah, they are.

277
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:25,667
Scott: shoot it with.

278
00:19:25,727 --> 00:19:26,872
Scott: you couldn't shoot it with like a guy.

279
00:19:26,893 --> 00:19:28,540
Scott: you shoot it with like a rocket or something.

280
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,141
Rym: They're.

281
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:30,329
Rym: they're big and slow.

282
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,899
Rym: It wouldn't be hard to shoot one down.

283
00:19:32,322 --> 00:19:33,268
Scott: Yeah, you just you couldn't.

284
00:19:33,328 --> 00:19:35,079
Scott: you know, if you shot it with a gun it would go ding.

285
00:19:35,622 --> 00:19:38,960
Scott: You'd have to shoot it with something better than that, you know, like certain sniper rifles.

286
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,079
Rym: I think a Barrett could take one out maybe but what's it gonna do?

287
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:42,220
Scott: good?

288
00:19:43,696 --> 00:19:46,047
Rym: Um It'll do a little more than that.

289
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:48,418
Rym: It won't catch on fire like the Hindenburg.

290
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:51,277
Scott: No No, well that was because that one was poorly made.

291
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:56,514
Rym: but well Yeah to dispel a common myth the Hindenburg did not burn because of what was in it.

292
00:19:56,794 --> 00:20:04,600
Rym: the Hindenburg burn because people didn't understand Chemistry so well and they painted the outside of the Hindenburg with what was effectively rocket fuel.

293
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,248
Scott: Yeah, basically that that's what happened.

294
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,375
Scott: You know, the hydrogen would just gone poof.

295
00:20:09,515 --> 00:20:10,839
Scott: It wouldn't have started burning like that.

296
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:16,180
Scott: Yep Anyway, this particular airship fell into the sea and was lost.

297
00:20:16,661 --> 00:20:18,928
Scott: Recently, they found it.

298
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,700
Scott: some fisherman a commercial fisherman caught a piece of it in his net.

299
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:29,420
Scott: it was some girder and he he showed it off at the local seafood restaurant and Thus be went huh?

300
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,825
Scott: Where did you get that from?

301
00:20:30,865 --> 00:20:42,359
Scott: and up lo and behold there's the airship and all sorts of other goodies under the sea that are fun to look at, you know, and it's especially fun to look at cuz It's a fucking airship.

302
00:20:43,281 --> 00:20:44,285
Scott: So check out this thing of the day.

303
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:46,232
Scott: Look at the pictures of the sunken airship.

304
00:20:46,854 --> 00:20:47,737
Scott: sunken airship.

305
00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:48,500
Scott: Isn't that kind of funny?

306
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:55,380
Scott: Well, you know it is a ship in the air But it's sunk in the water as opposed to like, you know floating out into space.

307
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,089
Rym: Well first it sunk to the ground and then it kept sinking.

308
00:20:58,289 --> 00:20:58,570
Scott: Yeah.

309
00:20:58,651 --> 00:20:58,892
Scott: Yeah.

310
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,778
Rym: Anyway, what can I say?

311
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:01,420
Rym: I like airships.

312
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,228
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty damn cool.

313
00:21:03,268 --> 00:21:03,911
Scott: Let me say that.

314
00:21:04,614 --> 00:21:05,619
Rym: so my thing of the day.

315
00:21:06,721 --> 00:21:14,305
Rym: I realized recently when I was talking about him that many of my friends have not actually seen his stand-up or didn't know that he Was anything other than mr.

316
00:21:14,345 --> 00:21:14,687
Rym: Bean.

317
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:16,152
Scott: I got mr.

318
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,618
Scott: Bean stories used to calling mr.

319
00:21:17,638 --> 00:21:17,818
Scott: Bean.

320
00:21:17,838 --> 00:21:20,373
Scott: in high school At least a few people did you kind of look like mr.

321
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:21,379
Scott: Bean a little bit.

322
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,102
Scott: You looked like.

323
00:21:22,142 --> 00:21:24,531
Rym: yes, you looked a lot more like him when we were freshmen.

324
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:25,053
Scott: Yeah.

325
00:21:25,355 --> 00:21:26,077
Rym: Yeah, you did.

326
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:28,180
Scott: All right Well, that was real close to high school.

327
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:36,885
Rym: I mean not so much in your physical appearance But in your mannerisms and the way you walked around and moved your head around and looked at things And shifted your eyes.

328
00:21:36,906 --> 00:21:37,609
Scott: Uh-huh.

329
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:38,956
Rym: You had a mr.

330
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:39,700
Rym: Beanish manner.

331
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,067
Rym: Alrighty, then there's a trait in burning wheel.

332
00:21:43,448 --> 00:21:46,736
Rym: But anyway, Rowan Atkinson the man who did mr.

333
00:21:46,776 --> 00:21:49,545
Rym: Bean while mr Bean is often hilarious.

334
00:21:50,026 --> 00:21:54,060
Rym: I would say that it is probably near the bottom of the funny things he has done.

335
00:21:54,822 --> 00:21:57,810
Rym: I mean the least funny thing Rowan Atkinson ever did was the mr.

336
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,100
Rym: Bean movie, which is probably the second worst movie ever made.

337
00:22:01,401 --> 00:22:02,990
Scott: I don't know a movie this mr.

338
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:03,432
Scott: Bean movie.

339
00:22:03,633 --> 00:22:04,176
Rym: It was called mr.

340
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:04,277
Rym: Bean.

341
00:22:05,681 --> 00:22:07,387
Scott: Okay, maybe y'all should see it sometime.

342
00:22:07,547 --> 00:22:11,866
Rym: I would watch MD guys like eight or nine times before I'd watch that fucking mr Bean book is.

343
00:22:11,907 --> 00:22:13,159
Scott: how could you not with you know?

344
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,860
Scott: A guy shooting a guy through the head and then using the same gun as a grappling hook in there?

345
00:22:18,201 --> 00:22:22,574
Rym: I would even watch Clifford almost once before I'd watch mr.

346
00:22:22,594 --> 00:22:22,814
Rym: Bean.

347
00:22:23,155 --> 00:22:23,436
Scott: Okay.

348
00:22:23,697 --> 00:22:27,006
Rym: Good God, but anyway He's most well known for mr.

349
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:29,656
Rym: Bean, but he was also the black adder.

350
00:22:29,817 --> 00:22:37,740
Rym: He was in the black adder which is an absolutely hilarious show and He was himself Rowan Atkinson doing stand-up stand-up skip comedy.

351
00:22:38,821 --> 00:22:55,720
Rym: I've found on YouTube and Google video a collection of many of the routine Stand-up bits that he would do and if you have never seen such things as fatal beating or welcome to hell You've really missed out on one of the funniest comedians I can remember.

352
00:22:56,603 --> 00:23:00,700
Scott: Yeah, yeah, I mean the funniest in a comedian ever I had to say is Richard Pryor.

353
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,829
Scott: But this stuff is also the hilarious.

354
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:04,516
Rym: I pretty much Richard Pryor.

355
00:23:04,556 --> 00:23:05,380
Rym: I put way up there.

356
00:23:05,661 --> 00:23:14,380
Scott: The thing is the only reason I put Richard Pryor at the top is because I've watched a lot of stand-up comedy in my day Right, but one day randomly a freshman year at RIT.

357
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:19,669
Scott: I remember it specifically like I knew who Richard Pryor was whatever But I was flipping through the channels.

358
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:21,737
Scott: cuz actually that was the last time I had television.

359
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:22,660
Rym: breathe no more.

360
00:23:25,922 --> 00:23:41,286
Scott: And I came upon Richard Pryor doing stand-up comedy on the TV Randomly and I was just uncontrollably Laughing it like from the time I switched to the to his channel to the time Beyond the time when it was over.

361
00:23:41,306 --> 00:23:46,099
Scott: I just couldn't stop laughing harder and longer than anyone else.

362
00:23:46,686 --> 00:23:49,747
Scott: See I gotta say though I think laughter is a good measure of the comedy.

363
00:23:49,988 --> 00:23:54,020
Rym: Dana Carvey had a similar effect on me the first time I saw his HBO special.

364
00:23:54,742 --> 00:23:57,692
Rym: Maybe maybe of course by the 80th time.

365
00:23:57,712 --> 00:23:59,539
Rym: I wasn't laughing so much anymore.

366
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:10,135
Rym: Yeah chopping broccoli Make a time make a to make a team make it to and in fact you Yeah, I mean like George Carlin Lewis black I love them all.

367
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:13,669
Scott: yeah, yeah I'm a big fan of comedy in general stand-up comedy.

368
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,275
Scott: But yeah, awesome.

369
00:24:15,717 --> 00:24:23,660
Rym: I still wish I Try to describe this comedians humor because then maybe one of you remember what his name was, but I can't really describe it.

370
00:24:24,308 --> 00:24:31,500
Rym: I'll just let it lie But I'll let it be known that there was this comedian that I saw on Comedy Central three times three different shows.

371
00:24:32,281 --> 00:24:35,751
Rym: Guy was utterly freaking hilarious and to this day.

372
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:38,699
Rym: I have no idea who that was and I've never seen him again.

373
00:24:39,643 --> 00:24:41,331
Scott: Was he the guy that died Hedberg?

374
00:24:41,351 --> 00:24:42,155
Rym: No, it wasn't.

375
00:24:42,175 --> 00:24:43,320
Rym: Hedberg wasn't Mitch Hedberg?

376
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:43,882
Scott: Okay.

377
00:24:44,003 --> 00:24:46,213
Scott: No, is that would explain why you never saw him again?

378
00:24:46,454 --> 00:24:47,459
Rym: No, no, no, it was this.

379
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:53,800
Rym: I'm not gonna get into it because I barely remember anything about the guy and most of his jokes were more visual than they were.

380
00:24:54,283 --> 00:24:56,019
Scott: Alright, well, let's get into our main bit then.

381
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,655
Rym: Oh the main bit that we've been avoiding because it's kind of a throwaway episode.

382
00:24:59,755 --> 00:25:00,759
Scott: Yeah the throw episode.

383
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:14,857
Scott: now Some of our listeners particularly one unnamed listener has named Has been pushing very hard for us to do an episode about what we're going to do an episode about right now.

384
00:25:14,878 --> 00:25:29,980
Rym: fact at Otakon during the GeekNights meet-and-greet where we were hanging out with a bunch of our fans and have a grand old time He asked us while we had a recorder out Exactly the question that we're going to begin answering in part 1 of how to deal with the zombie apocalypse.

385
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:35,300
Scott: Well, I don't like the word apocalypse because then you're assuming that it's a zombie apocalypse.

386
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,317
Scott: It's basically how to deal with any number of zombie happenings.

387
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:43,090
Rym: Yes I mean zombie apocalypse is one tip type of scenario.

388
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,217
Rym: The problem is zombie apocalypse.

389
00:25:45,598 --> 00:25:47,425
Rym: in the end You're pretty much always fucked.

390
00:25:47,586 --> 00:25:49,413
Scott: Yeah, because you're assuming there's an apocalypse.

391
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:51,100
Scott: So it is the end of the world and you're done.

392
00:25:51,461 --> 00:26:00,300
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty much the dawn of the dead and you can try to survive longer perhaps But the end result is the same if it is absolutely a zombie apocalypse.

393
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:06,700
Rym: Luckily, you can't know during it if it is a zombie apocalypse or not or just a zombie outbreak.

394
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,604
Rym: 88 days later showed us.

395
00:26:07,645 --> 00:26:07,785
Rym: Yes.

396
00:26:07,826 --> 00:26:20,251
Scott: Yes So yes the first thing you need to do when deciding how you're going to survive a zombie attack of some sort is Get information about the zombie attack.

397
00:26:20,593 --> 00:26:21,216
Rym: Yeah now I get well.

398
00:26:21,236 --> 00:26:29,262
Rym: before we go any further I just want to say that this is not going to be a multi-part in the sense that we're going to do a series on Zombies.

399
00:26:29,604 --> 00:26:32,655
Rym: Oh, no, no, no, but every time we need to throw away Thursday.

400
00:26:32,735 --> 00:26:35,120
Rym: I think it'll be instead of monkey Tuesday It'll be throwaway Thursday.

401
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:37,548
Scott: It's one of those geeky things that you know.

402
00:26:37,748 --> 00:26:44,032
Scott: geeky people talk about and discuss for fun when they're bored and you know That's what we're gonna do when we got nothing better to talk about.

403
00:26:44,052 --> 00:26:45,780
Scott: We'll just start talking about some hobbies.

404
00:26:46,241 --> 00:26:54,060
Rym: So today we're going to go over how to figure out what kind of zombie attack it is and How we would determine what we're going to do.

405
00:26:54,120 --> 00:27:00,780
Rym: But we can't talk about specifics because it really depends on the exact nature of the zombies that exists.

406
00:27:01,342 --> 00:27:05,680
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I mean what if there's a zombie outbreak in California and I'm in New York?

407
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:07,739
Scott: Well, that gives me a lot of time, doesn't it?

408
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:12,240
Rym: Now what if they're slow-moving zombies that don't turn you into a zombie unless you die?

409
00:27:12,742 --> 00:27:16,459
Rym: What if they're fast-moving zombies that turn you into a zombie if they so much as scratch you?

410
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:18,458
Scott: yeah What if Rym is the first zombie?

411
00:27:19,562 --> 00:27:21,367
Rym: Yeah, what are they lurching zombies?

412
00:27:21,447 --> 00:27:22,750
Rym: Are they strong zombies?

413
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,014
Rym: Are they magic zombies?

414
00:27:24,034 --> 00:27:25,097
Rym: Are they science zombies?

415
00:27:25,117 --> 00:27:26,220
Rym: Are they disease zombies?

416
00:27:27,881 --> 00:27:30,820
Scott: Everything hinges on these questions and their answers.

417
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:36,980
Scott: I mean It's changing the answer just slightly changes the whole strategy of how not to get killed and turn into a zombie.

418
00:27:37,341 --> 00:27:42,020
Rym: Thus today we're mostly just going to talk about how to assess the zombie apocalypse.

419
00:27:42,781 --> 00:27:53,548
Scott: Well, I think first what we should do is you should take things that are assumed to be true in any zombie situation that is zombies are Former humans of some sort.

420
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,199
Scott: they were human and now they are something else.

421
00:27:56,662 --> 00:27:58,751
Rym: yes, they may or may not have been dead.

422
00:27:58,771 --> 00:28:08,590
Rym: they may or may not be dead and They seek to turn other humans into zombies by some means or in the very I mean They might not be able to turn you into a zombie at all.

423
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,420
Rym: It might just be dead people.

424
00:28:10,902 --> 00:28:14,060
Rym: It might just be I think the most common definition.

425
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:18,957
Scott: But there is a danger of lit non zombie humans becoming zombies.

426
00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:23,320
Rym: Yes Though I there are some situations I could see where that wouldn't be the case.

427
00:28:23,621 --> 00:28:29,640
Rym: I mean say a meteor went by and woke up all the dead people, but then the meteor crashed and that stopped happening.

428
00:28:30,483 --> 00:28:40,060
Scott: Oh, so only the graveyards had zombies and then there was a limited Finite number of zombies and all the living people were never zombies and they're just living people.

429
00:28:40,321 --> 00:28:41,447
Rym: So that is a possibility.

430
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:42,151
Rym: However remote.

431
00:28:42,412 --> 00:28:43,900
Scott: Yeah, that would count.

432
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,860
Rym: Yeah, now I guess I mean the way you could really distinguish the zombie attack here is that regardless of how they came about?

433
00:28:50,380 --> 00:29:10,310
Rym: zombies either are generally aggressive toward humans and or other living things or zombies specifically are attempting to either kill people and turn them into zombies or They just have a hunger for brains that can't be satisfied any other way except the vegetarian zombies.

434
00:29:11,073 --> 00:29:12,518
Rym: Don't go make that fucking joke.

435
00:29:12,739 --> 00:29:13,703
Scott: Great.

436
00:29:14,245 --> 00:29:15,550
Rym: I hate you so much.

437
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:18,619
Scott: It's Thursday, leave me alone.

438
00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:24,770
Rym: Yeah throwaway Thursdays Alright.

439
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:42,261
Rym: So so generally what we'll assume in any zombie case is that they are humanoid beings that were once human that have become Generally malevolent beings that have little intelligence and are attempting to harm and the very least humans Mm-hmm.

440
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:50,269
Scott: Another thing you had to realize though I just I was thinking about the case you just brought up where all the dead people come back to life as zombies and that's it.

441
00:29:51,253 --> 00:29:54,370
Scott: There are more people alive now than have ever died.

442
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,155
Scott: Win that by.

443
00:29:56,436 --> 00:29:59,847
Rym: you can't make a statement like that because we don't really know.

444
00:29:59,867 --> 00:30:00,870
Scott: Yeah, we do.

445
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:01,532
Rym: No, we don't.

446
00:30:01,572 --> 00:30:03,017
Rym: that is that is a contention.

447
00:30:03,057 --> 00:30:04,963
Rym: That is up to a great deal of debate.

448
00:30:05,043 --> 00:30:07,030
Rym: And also what do you consider a human?

449
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,475
Rym: What's the exact line?

450
00:30:08,535 --> 00:30:09,318
Rym: just our species?

451
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:10,102
Rym: What about hominids?

452
00:30:10,283 --> 00:30:12,010
Scott: Yeah, there are zombie elephants.

453
00:30:12,051 --> 00:30:13,209
Scott: We're definitely in trouble.

454
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:14,163
Rym: So I'll be monkeys.

455
00:30:14,366 --> 00:30:22,703
Rym: a Normal monkey could kill both of us if this room there were a monkey here in that blue chair and that monkey wanted to kill Us unless it was a spider monkey.

456
00:30:22,844 --> 00:30:29,269
Rym: We'd both be dead Yeah, and if it was a spider monkey one of us would still be dead or at least covered in shit.

457
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,639
Scott: Vomit and god knows what other kind of mess.

458
00:30:33,141 --> 00:30:34,307
Rym: god spider monkeys.

459
00:30:34,427 --> 00:30:38,509
Scott: Yeah so How should we begin?

460
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:43,185
Rym: She'll propose a scenario and then or just generally how to react.

461
00:30:43,205 --> 00:30:44,028
Rym: we could talk about that.

462
00:30:44,048 --> 00:30:46,157
Rym: All right All right, so let's say we don't know.

463
00:30:46,238 --> 00:30:53,309
Rym: let's say we're sitting here doing GeekNights right now And our friend Scott Johnson calls the cell phone that's sitting next to me the ringers off and I ignore it.

464
00:30:53,913 --> 00:30:56,169
Rym: He calls it five or six more times.

465
00:30:56,591 --> 00:30:59,038
Rym: So I think huh and I pick the phone up.

466
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:06,521
Rym: and Scott Johnson being the stalwart defender against all things malevolent Because you know your friend Scott Johnson is waiting for this day.

467
00:31:07,444 --> 00:31:09,490
Rym: He is the first line of defense.

468
00:31:09,731 --> 00:31:12,470
Rym: He is nor ad when it comes to zombies and vampires.

469
00:31:12,891 --> 00:31:19,734
Rym: Basically, if any of those come to exist Scott Johnson will call the both of us first and tell us it begins and then we'll Do whatever.

470
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:20,037
Rym: do it.

471
00:31:20,643 --> 00:31:21,370
Scott: I pick up the phone.

472
00:31:21,812 --> 00:31:25,848
Scott: The first thing you have to do is get someone in the world to be your nor ad.

473
00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:27,715
Rym: yes We have Scott Johnson.

474
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,545
Rym: You could have us but now you're one degree away.

475
00:31:30,846 --> 00:31:32,010
Rym: You won't get worn right away.

476
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,950
Rym: I am going to do things before I warn you about this.

477
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,797
Scott: I can also be a nor ad.

478
00:31:36,877 --> 00:31:42,137
Scott: the problem with that is you need to spend every waking moment of your life in a Constant vigil for zombie happenings.

479
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:42,559
Rym: Yes.

480
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,924
Rym: No, you could narrow it down.

481
00:31:43,964 --> 00:31:48,357
Rym: I mean Scott Johnson is a Evil magic or evil zombie.

482
00:31:48,397 --> 00:31:48,819
Rym: nor ad.

483
00:31:48,859 --> 00:31:49,661
Rym: he's really broad.

484
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:51,666
Rym: He's watching for vampires.

485
00:31:51,907 --> 00:31:52,970
Rym: He's watching for magic.

486
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,195
Rym: He's watching for all of that.

487
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:57,027
Rym: If you're just a zombie nor ad it's real easy.

488
00:31:57,087 --> 00:31:57,750
Rym: Just watch the news.

489
00:31:58,851 --> 00:32:05,810
Rym: Just watch all the news and the moment you hear about a disease anywhere that isn't explained go to like Def Con 2 and wait.

490
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,393
Rym: Yeah That's really it.

491
00:32:08,474 --> 00:32:09,718
Rym: All you can do is watch the news.

492
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,862
Scott: Hmm unless the zombies are happening in your town Yeah, but even then you're you all.

493
00:32:14,882 --> 00:32:16,149
Rym: you just kind of be generally wary.

494
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:17,345
Rym: Mmm-hmm.

495
00:32:18,092 --> 00:32:24,221
Scott: Make sure when you see someone walking on the street if they're walking kind of slow if they got their hands out in front of Them go check them out.

496
00:32:24,301 --> 00:32:26,951
Scott: Make sure you know, they're not Zombified.

497
00:32:27,473 --> 00:32:31,248
Scott: Yeah, because seriously it could be that just one zombie and that's it.

498
00:32:31,891 --> 00:32:37,890
Rym: However, Scott Johnson the nor ad the one thing that he is always impressed upon us in his knowledge of being a zombie.

499
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:53,927
Rym: Nor ad is that if you ever come across a zombie or Vampire or anything like that that immediately makes the odds that other similar things exist go from practically zero To not one but an infinitely larger number.

500
00:32:53,947 --> 00:33:03,369
Rym: Yep I mean if you see one zombie That's when you start grabbing crosses and see if they work on things Start digging up people that you might think are vampires and staking them.

501
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:06,882
Scott: So when you get like Necronomicon and start reading them, yep.

502
00:33:06,922 --> 00:33:07,123
Rym: Yep.

503
00:33:07,143 --> 00:33:09,110
Rym: You start trying to cast spells just in case.

504
00:33:09,471 --> 00:33:13,165
Rym: Yeah, I mean I don't try to cast spells every day only because the odds are they won't work.

505
00:33:13,586 --> 00:33:15,915
Rym: if I run into a vampire You can bet your ass.

506
00:33:15,935 --> 00:33:19,390
Rym: I'm gonna find every old skin bound book I can get and read every word out loud.

507
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:24,388
Scott: I'll be sacrificing the lambs and shit trying to get some spell action going on.

508
00:33:24,449 --> 00:33:28,430
Rym: Yeah Yeah, so again, the first thing you have to do is have intelligence.

509
00:33:28,551 --> 00:33:30,201
Rym: That is probably the most important thing.

510
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:40,212
Rym: the sooner you figure out What kinds of zombies these are and what kind of threat they pose the better chance you have of surviving until the end and possibly winning Mm-hmm.

511
00:33:40,733 --> 00:33:52,476
Scott: Now you might be able if you're lucky to get all this information from the news and the internet and your friends and such because someone else far away will figure it out and Disseminate the information around the world.

512
00:33:52,577 --> 00:33:57,133
Rym: However, if zombie movies are any indication, that's not gonna fucking happen Anything.

513
00:33:57,153 --> 00:34:06,058
Rym: you'll turn on the news and you'll see a reporter freaking out and then being killed by a zombie and then there won't be any useful radio Television or anything even your hair.

514
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:11,429
Scott: you're gonna have to rely on your ham radio guys and those guys There are usually fat so they won't be.

515
00:34:12,712 --> 00:34:16,250
Rym: So the step to know at least one radio nerd.

516
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:23,330
Rym: Every zombie movie worth its salt has the one guy who has the radio and he's the one who makes contact with that one other.

517
00:34:24,292 --> 00:34:27,804
Scott: Or if you're seriously worried about zombies because I got to be honest, I'm not.

518
00:34:28,206 --> 00:34:32,949
Scott: even though I'm prepared I'm not worried about zombies because the chances of zombies are pretty much yes.

519
00:34:33,074 --> 00:34:42,149
Rym: I mean I'm ready for zombies if I hear that zombies exist Instead of freaking out because the normal human reaction is to freak out for like five minutes before you deal with it.

520
00:34:42,652 --> 00:34:44,058
Rym: I'm ready, so I won't freak out.

521
00:34:44,319 --> 00:34:55,810
Scott: I'll immediately a Mac enact rims zombie plan Yes But if you are worried about it I suggest becoming a ham radio hobbyist to getting your license and everything like that because that'll help a lot more than many other things.

522
00:34:56,071 --> 00:35:00,470
Rym: Yep, I mean medicine is not gonna work so well, especially if they're infecting zombies.

523
00:35:00,711 --> 00:35:03,521
Scott: Yeah, you're basically your second skill that you're gonna want.

524
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:08,300
Scott: after ham radio skill is gun the skill Alright, so here's the important question.

525
00:35:08,681 --> 00:35:10,690
Rym: You can you've got intelligence, you know zombies exist.

526
00:35:11,354 --> 00:35:14,129
Rym: What information do you need before you can figure out what to do?

527
00:35:14,952 --> 00:35:22,382
Rym: You need to know very briefly one what kinds of zombies they are What creates them?

528
00:35:22,482 --> 00:35:23,609
Rym: Where do they come from?

529
00:35:24,452 --> 00:35:26,047
Rym: how can they be killed?

530
00:35:26,067 --> 00:35:31,270
Rym: and Is there any like special thing like a special secret thing?

531
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:39,429
Rym: you know the plot point at the end of the movie like ah, if you say was it was it they explode or They only last one nights?

532
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:41,518
Scott: Yeah, the other thing you have to know.

533
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,936
Scott: if they poke what threat to these zombies posed to you They might be benign zombies.

534
00:35:46,136 --> 00:35:49,910
Scott: It could be you know, they just walk around aimlessly and do nothing and then they die.

535
00:35:50,991 --> 00:35:53,818
Rym: Yep, and also where did they spawn?

536
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,410
Rym: Did they all come from one place that they simultaneously appear all around the world?

537
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:04,490
Rym: That is really key because in the case of the former everything's gonna be okay.

538
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,410
Rym: It's probably gonna be like a really easy cakewalk.

539
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:11,026
Rym: If you know either a disease or something 88 something you'll get.

540
00:36:11,046 --> 00:36:11,810
Rym: you'll feel safe yourself.

541
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:19,349
Scott: Yeah, if it was all in one place You know the National Guard or your country's military will surround that place and you'll have no problems.

542
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:21,010
Rym: plus It's probably a freak accident.

543
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:33,910
Rym: It's probably either some disease got loose or some portal to a dark world open or some necromance are fucked up Necromancer, but if zombies are appearing all over the world simultaneously You might have a Dawn of the Dead situation.

544
00:36:34,051 --> 00:36:38,230
Scott: You might have a very bad situation because you basically can't run away anywhere.

545
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:46,110
Scott: You need to hole up and survive for as long as possible Perhaps in some sort of biodome or farm or space shuttle.

546
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:49,965
Rym: So I guess in or boat in order of what you need to know.

547
00:36:50,246 --> 00:36:51,170
Rym: you start with.

548
00:36:51,511 --> 00:36:56,390
Rym: Where are the zombies right now if they're in LA and you're in New York?

549
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:59,890
Rym: You have a lot more time to plan if they're down the street.

550
00:37:00,355 --> 00:37:07,790
Rym: You've got to act immediately Mmm, so figure that out before you do anything and then right after that figure out what kind of zombie that is.

551
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:09,133
Rym: That is.

552
00:37:09,475 --> 00:37:12,130
Rym: that is probably the biggest factor in your survival.

553
00:37:13,052 --> 00:37:14,559
Rym: You can break it into a whole bunch of elements.

554
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,090
Rym: Are they fast zombies or slow zombies?

555
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:18,747
Scott: Yeah, are they?

556
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:24,846
Scott: Zombies that can turn you into a zombie or are they zombies that just kind of don't do anything?

557
00:37:25,227 --> 00:37:32,509
Rym: if they're the former Do they do it by biting your neck by killing you by scratching you by being near you?

558
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:35,389
Scott: Are the zombies strong or are they weak?

559
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:41,830
Scott: You know do they wander around aimlessly or do they smell your brains and come after them quickly?

560
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,397
Rym: Are they living or dead?

561
00:37:44,938 --> 00:37:51,581
Rym: if they're actually dead then it's either going to be one of those headshot Situations or destroy the head situations.

562
00:37:51,721 --> 00:37:54,130
Rym: or you know some magical solution situation.

563
00:37:55,193 --> 00:37:57,099
Scott: How are the zombies destroyed?

564
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:58,483
Scott: can they be destroyed?

565
00:37:58,503 --> 00:38:04,023
Rym: because if they're living if they're living beings with a disease You can fight them the way you would fight anyone on PCP.

566
00:38:04,525 --> 00:38:04,605
Rym: Mmm.

567
00:38:04,665 --> 00:38:05,750
Rym: You just beat them to death.

568
00:38:06,091 --> 00:38:07,216
Scott: Yeah, can they?

569
00:38:07,276 --> 00:38:07,939
Scott: can they jump?

570
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:08,963
Scott: can they climb?

571
00:38:09,044 --> 00:38:10,470
Scott: How can you slow them down?

572
00:38:10,591 --> 00:38:13,110
Scott: Will they be able to break through a barrier, you know?

573
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:15,320
Scott: Can you hold them off instead of killing them all?

574
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,470
Rym: can they detect humans or not?

575
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,574
Rym: And if so, how?

576
00:38:18,895 --> 00:38:19,638
Rym: what draws them?

577
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:20,682
Rym: are they attracted to light?

578
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,490
Rym: are they attracted to shopping malls?

579
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:27,416
Scott: Are they attracted to Underground, you know train tracks?

580
00:38:27,757 --> 00:38:31,750
Rym: if they see a human do they become aggressive or they just attack anything in front of them?

581
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,618
Rym: Mmm, do they attack non humans?

582
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,926
Scott: Do they attack non living things?

583
00:38:37,026 --> 00:38:38,130
Rym: Do they attack each other?

584
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:41,090
Scott: Do they even attack or do they just go around aimlessly?

585
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:45,470
Rym: Do they just swipe if you're nearby and you also have to worry about a lot of tricky situations.

586
00:38:45,571 --> 00:38:47,290
Rym: I mean fast or slow zombie, right?

587
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:52,503
Rym: I mean you've seen fast zombies, you know The zombie that runs at full tilt at you and then tears you apart.

588
00:38:52,683 --> 00:38:58,634
Rym: Yeah, and then the slow shuffling Brains.

589
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:01,970
Rym: but zombie cannot swallow this injustice.

590
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:10,109
Rym: But there's a really tricky situation you got to watch out for and this has been a furious subject of debate among the front row crew.

591
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:18,310
Rym: Lunging zombies are one of the most dangerous kinds of zombies because they give all the appearances of a slow zombie.

592
00:39:18,653 --> 00:39:29,162
Rym: They shuffle slowly and slowly Brains, but then when you're within, you know, eight feet They suddenly lunge like as fast as lightning and get you.

593
00:39:29,183 --> 00:39:31,590
Rym: Mmm, but you won't know that right away.

594
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:35,530
Rym: It's real hard to figure out if it's a lunging zombie or not without letting someone die.

595
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:50,290
Scott: now the worst thing that can kill you you know is if they're a mixed bag if some zombies are fast and some are slow if some are strong and some are weak if some can get you with A scratch and some with a bite then you basically need to be prepared for all these different situations.

596
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:57,955
Scott: You know if some get killed with a headshot and some get killed with a silver bullet you're gonna need to get like silver Shotgun shells.

597
00:39:58,015 --> 00:40:02,350
Scott: it's it's really gonna suck and it things just get worse when you have a mixed bag of zombies.

598
00:40:02,873 --> 00:40:05,990
Scott: So you better hope that there's just one kind of zombie.

599
00:40:06,673 --> 00:40:10,127
Scott: You better hope there's no kind but one kind any more than one kind.

600
00:40:10,147 --> 00:40:10,770
Scott: you're in trouble.

601
00:40:11,892 --> 00:40:15,790
Rym: So, let's say for the sake of argument that the zombies are in your town.

602
00:40:16,151 --> 00:40:19,942
Rym: You don't know the situation in the rest of the world, but you know, they're in your town.

603
00:40:20,263 --> 00:40:22,670
Rym: You can see them down the street.

604
00:40:23,774 --> 00:40:29,902
Scott: All right, step one Can you get to the grocery store without going through the zombies?

605
00:40:30,544 --> 00:40:31,166
Rym: Well, I think.

606
00:40:31,226 --> 00:40:32,290
Scott: or the hardware store?

607
00:40:32,332 --> 00:40:34,637
Rym: Yeah well before you do anything don't even worry about that.

608
00:40:34,877 --> 00:40:45,882
Rym: get some binoculars or something and try to observe the zombies because hopefully Some curious neighbors will wander out and see what's going on and you can watch to see if they're lunging zombies or not if they're Fast or slow all that stuff.

609
00:40:46,205 --> 00:40:52,709
Rym: Mmm I mean if they're slow zombies and and they're not lunging or anything, even if they're killing people don't fucking worry about it.

610
00:40:53,031 --> 00:40:54,397
Rym: Yeah, those kind of zombies.

611
00:40:54,658 --> 00:40:57,110
Rym: You could probably just close your door and go back to playing video games.

612
00:40:57,694 --> 00:40:59,930
Scott: Maybe maybe but it also might be fun.

613
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:02,690
Scott: See, here's the thing, you know, that's the safest thing to do.

614
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:08,829
Scott: But you might want to go get in your car and run them over for fun Especially if you have a nice big truck.

615
00:41:10,072 --> 00:41:15,298
Rym: But then you got to figure out if they're slow like let's say all right, we observe them We see that they're slow killing zombies.

616
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,682
Rym: They are killing people.

617
00:41:16,963 --> 00:41:18,547
Rym: when they see humans they go after them.

618
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:22,070
Rym: now We got to figure out if they're massing anywhere or not.

619
00:41:22,311 --> 00:41:23,675
Rym: Are they organized in any way?

620
00:41:24,016 --> 00:41:28,569
Rym: because if it looks like they're massing the answer is always get the fuck out of town.

621
00:41:30,172 --> 00:41:33,630
Rym: Because if they're massing that means you'll go to sleep you'll wake up in the morning.

622
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,826
Rym: Now your house is surrounded by more zombies than you can kill.

623
00:41:36,846 --> 00:41:40,310
Rym: at that point You're dead because you won't get enough food and you'll starve to death.

624
00:41:40,591 --> 00:41:46,590
Scott: Yeah, I mean you could like if there's a mass somewhere but it's not near your house.

625
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:55,969
Scott: you might be able to pull a trick like a throwing a Exploding propane tank making a big gap in the zombies and then driving through it to escape or something like that.

626
00:41:56,591 --> 00:41:59,261
Scott: But you can't let the mass for too long or else.

627
00:41:59,341 --> 00:42:01,730
Scott: It's too big for even a propane tank explosion.

628
00:42:02,931 --> 00:42:07,710
Rym: Now we don't get a lot of go long on this and there's also the fact that we did this episode mostly as a throwaway.

629
00:42:08,131 --> 00:42:13,390
Rym: But in the future when we do more of these episodes, I think we can illustrate a fairly important point.

630
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:16,310
Rym: There's actually a moral to all of these zombie episodes.

631
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:19,622
Scott: We love morality turn turn turn the moral.

632
00:42:20,003 --> 00:42:26,728
Rym: and we talked today, you know about gathering the intelligence And we'll probably talk next time we do this about weapons and that sort of thing.

633
00:42:26,808 --> 00:42:27,330
Scott: the fun part

634
00:42:27,531 --> 00:42:48,130
Rym: Yeah, but in terms of this discussion think of it this way We are geeks we also have no drama in our lives and We very rarely have trouble because we usually plan ahead for just about everything every Possible contingency or at least we put ourselves in a situation where well, we haven't planned for a particular contingency.

635
00:42:48,492 --> 00:42:56,063
Rym: we are ready to deal with it regardless of whether or not we've prepared and The key is simply to approach any problem in your life.

636
00:42:56,304 --> 00:42:57,689
Rym: No matter what that problem is.

637
00:42:58,171 --> 00:43:05,538
Rym: Logically if you wake up one day and you walk outside and there's a dragon just sleeping in the street Don't freak out and run around immediately.

638
00:43:05,578 --> 00:43:07,565
Rym: Just think why is this dragon here?

639
00:43:08,207 --> 00:43:09,090
Rym: What might he want?

640
00:43:09,452 --> 00:43:10,300
Rym: Is he looking at me?

641
00:43:10,361 --> 00:43:11,169
Rym: Is he going to kill me?

642
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:16,710
Rym: How can I deal with this situation in a productive constructive and possibly life-saving way?

643
00:43:18,351 --> 00:43:40,389
Scott: Another thing you can look at it is a lot of people in this world completely lack Basic problem-solving skills, you know, they might know a lot of stuff and they might not be stupid But you know if their computer is broken or their car is broken They can't apply basic logic and saying oh this is caused by that Which means the problem must be in this area and such and such and such.

644
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:42,376
Rym: Yeah approach things logically.

645
00:43:42,476 --> 00:43:43,359
Rym: at least try to.

646
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,656
Rym: if you if something bad happens at least try to figure out why it happened.

647
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,648
Rym: if there's a way you can avoid it in the future.

648
00:43:49,668 --> 00:44:01,429
Scott: and Trying to figure out how to survive various zombie scenarios is a great exercise of your Problem-solving muscle and will help you in other areas of life in which you must solve problems.

649
00:44:02,293 --> 00:44:03,156
Rym: You know, you know what?

650
00:44:03,176 --> 00:44:06,650
Rym: I love more than anything and I think we'll end on this, you know being throwaway Thursday.

651
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:13,590
Rym: Yeah, we managed to turn a throwaway episode about killing fucking zombies into some sort of moral lesson.

652
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:17,667
Scott: yeah, so we're gonna have real episodes next week.

653
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:22,293
Scott: and then Next Friday Saturday and Sunday is Sitakan.

654
00:44:22,434 --> 00:44:25,090
Scott: Yes in tomorrow a week from tomorrow.

655
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:30,739
Rym: Yeah, like we always said in the anime club not this weekend But next week October 6 7th and 8th 2006.

656
00:44:30,739 --> 00:44:31,461

657
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:36,539
Scott: Come see us and many other awesome people.

658
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,924
Rym: We've talked about it all week.

659
00:44:38,205 --> 00:44:39,530
Rym: We've linked to it in the forums.

660
00:44:39,972 --> 00:44:42,930
Rym: We're gonna talk about it more next week is gonna be an awesome con.

661
00:44:43,211 --> 00:44:44,056
Rym: I suggest you go.

662
00:44:44,418 --> 00:44:46,689
Rym: if you live at RIT, I suggest you spread the word.

663
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:51,369
Rym: That's about it and if the zombies come we'll be there waiting.

664
00:44:52,310 --> 00:45:02,748
Rym: and That was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
