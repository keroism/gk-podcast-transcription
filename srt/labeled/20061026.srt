00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,961
Rym: It's Thursday October 26 that this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,482 --> 00:00:19,569
Rym: tonight with our brand new and mostly configured Compressor we bring you our pre Halloween Halloween special.

3
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:24,955
Rym: Let's do this Great googly moogly.

4
00:00:24,995 --> 00:00:26,901
Rym: We got a compressor and Rym.

5
00:00:27,062 --> 00:00:29,350
Scott: We talked about it already and Rym forgot to hit record.

6
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:33,565
Rym: I was so excited about the new compressor that I just totally didn't hit record on the computer.

7
00:00:33,665 --> 00:00:34,930
Scott: So let's talk about it again.

8
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:36,997
Scott: Yeah, god damn is it fancy?

9
00:00:37,218 --> 00:00:46,510
Rym: Yeah, I mean we had our old compressor and it was like 70 bucks including You know shipping attacks and all that and we couldn't actually get the power cable for it from the company.

10
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:47,549
Rym: They're on backorder.

11
00:00:48,153 --> 00:00:55,210
Rym: So instead of you know, not having a compressor for another couple weeks We just upgraded and bought a real real fancy compressor.

12
00:00:55,912 --> 00:01:02,535
Scott: Yeah, it's actually two compressors in one in each of them is fancier than the single compressor We used to have.

13
00:01:02,756 --> 00:01:04,849
Scott: by that we still have but can't power.

14
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:05,673
Rym: Yes, though soon.

15
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:10,090
Rym: We'll be able to power that one and I'm going to set up an awesome three compressor setup.

16
00:01:10,392 --> 00:01:12,990
Rym: That's gonna kick the dog dick of a new bits his ass.

17
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:18,227
Scott: We're gonna have to go out and get like seven compressors.

18
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:21,981
Scott: I'll be like, yeah the more compressors we have the better.

19
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:38,109
Rym: a frickin be a wolf cluster Eventually of compressors will compress the audio to the point that all GeekNights will be is Hi guess so Yeah, I got to say though I mean our old compressor had some lights on it and they would move around a bit.

20
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:41,423
Rym: But there are some goddamn lights on this compressor.

21
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:42,910
Scott: Yeah, I'm really liking the lights.

22
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:46,587
Scott: It's giving me something to look at while we do the podcast instead of rims.

23
00:01:46,627 --> 00:01:49,458
Rym: ugly ass My ass is quite covered at the moment.

24
00:01:49,578 --> 00:01:50,702
Scott: Well your ugly ass face.

25
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:52,327
Rym: Yeah, I face away from you.

26
00:01:52,347 --> 00:01:53,090
Rym: What are you talking about?

27
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,949
Scott: That's exactly why I'm looking at the damn lights.

28
00:01:57,647 --> 00:02:02,190
Rym: Yeah So anyway in the news I would have saved this for you know a video game day.

29
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,683
Rym: But it's kind of urgent because if Walmart doesn't fix its mistake tonight or tomorrow.

30
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,589
Rym: You might be able to take advantage of this.

31
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,315
Rym: Walmart made a mistake.

32
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:15,871
Rym: They are currently selling Guitar Hero 2 for $79.92.

33
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:24,049
Scott: Well right now there's a picture of one Walmart selling Guitar Hero 2 and you can see clearly There's a bunch of Guitar Hero 2's on the shelf.

34
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,205
Rym: Well, there are reports in forums that other Walmart's are doing the same thing.

35
00:02:28,245 --> 00:02:40,229
Rym: It may not be all Walmart's We don't know exactly what the story is But if you live near Walmart and you want Guitar Heroes 2 As much as I hate everything that is Walmart go see if you can pick it up.

36
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:50,190
Scott: Yeah, normally I would not encourage shopping at Walmart under any circumstances But this gets close to the line at which shopping at Walmart is okay.

37
00:02:50,812 --> 00:02:52,761
Scott: I mean they got a game out, but how?

38
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:54,750
Scott: when's Guitar Hero 2 supposed to come out?

39
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:55,573
Rym: I don't even know.

40
00:02:55,673 --> 00:02:57,281
Scott: it's supposed to come out a while from now.

41
00:02:57,341 --> 00:02:59,150
Scott: It's not like a few days early.

42
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:04,530
Scott: We're talking a lot of days early, and you know Walmart does have a reason to come out two weeks from now.

43
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,916
Scott: Yeah, two weeks early.

44
00:03:06,278 --> 00:03:08,869
Scott: God damn if some imagine if Walmart was selling Wii's.

45
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,155
Scott: Yeah, two weeks early.

46
00:03:10,175 --> 00:03:13,430
Scott: I mean it's one for Twilight Princess Gamecube two weeks early.

47
00:03:13,712 --> 00:03:16,910
Rym: I mean imagine you know someone comes over to your house, and they're like man.

48
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,590
Rym: I can't wait to get Guitar Heroes next week, and you're like man.

49
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,858
Rym: I unlocked the whole game three days ago.

50
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:29,930
Scott: Yeah, so if you have a ps2 Man, it might be worth it to go to your Walmart and see if they got the game on the shelf.

51
00:03:30,091 --> 00:03:33,869
Rym: I'll probably have some sort of follow-up on Tuesday once we find out exactly what the deal was.

52
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:38,629
Scott: of course We don't have a ps2 and if we did well, we probably would have bought Guitar Hero 2.

53
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:40,440
Rym: Yeah Well, you know it's kind of like.

54
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,751
Scott: probably would have bought Guitar Hero 1.

55
00:03:42,751 --> 00:03:44,137
Scott: Yeah, here's the thing I don't get.

56
00:03:44,217 --> 00:03:47,229
Scott: Guitar Hero comes in a box with a guitar, right?

57
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:52,001
Scott: What if you bought Guitar Hero 1 and you already have two guitars?

58
00:03:52,503 --> 00:03:54,910
Scott: Can you buy Guitar Hero 2 sans guitar?

59
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,169
Rym: I'm pretty sure you can but I'm not a hundred percent sure.

60
00:03:58,853 --> 00:03:59,616
Rym: I mean, I know you can buy.

61
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,805
Rym: Donkey Kong is with or without the Kongas.

62
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:02,247
Scott: Yep.

63
00:04:02,287 --> 00:04:06,001
Rym: That is true That is true, and the people who made Guitar Hero are not stupid.

64
00:04:06,684 --> 00:04:08,350
Scott: We should try to get Donkey Konga.

65
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:08,753
Scott: I don't know.

66
00:04:08,794 --> 00:04:10,650
Scott: Maybe it's not worth it that the Wii's coming.

67
00:04:11,232 --> 00:04:13,680
Rym: I imagine there will be similar better games for the Wii.

68
00:04:13,741 --> 00:04:16,410
Scott: Yeah, I think Donkey Konga is just something we'll have to pass over.

69
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,820
Scott: We'll get some drumming games or use the wiimotes as drumsticks.

70
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,401
Rym: Yeah.

71
00:04:20,682 --> 00:04:30,744
Scott: Yeah, so I was gonna save this news for Monday just like Rym was gonna save his for Tuesday, but Ubuntu edgy F came out today.

72
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:35,080
Scott: ish and Let me tell you this is not like.

73
00:04:35,562 --> 00:04:41,262
Scott: it's an official Ubuntu release Number six dot ten because it's October 2006.

74
00:04:41,262 --> 00:04:49,687
Scott: Oh, oh But it is not, you know the recommended default Ubuntu.

75
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:51,653
Scott: you should use Ubuntu.

76
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:57,750
Scott: dapper Drake still has the three year support agreement or whatever how many years they decided.

77
00:04:58,372 --> 00:05:14,829
Scott: so if you have a system that is important, like I don't know the server that runs your Website or your company's mail server You're gonna want to use dapper Drake because well, it's guaranteed and supported and all that good stuff.

78
00:05:15,492 --> 00:05:25,932
Scott: But edgy effed if you are using a desktop computer for Linux or if you're gonna try out Linux to see if you like it edgy effed is Like.

79
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:26,273
Scott: I didn't.

80
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,980
Scott: I was didn't think it would improve on dapper that much.

81
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:30,063
Scott: Holy shit.

82
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:32,850
Scott: Is it 10,000 times better than dapper Drake?

83
00:05:33,072 --> 00:05:34,770
Rym: Yeah, I mean, let me put this in perspective.

84
00:05:35,452 --> 00:05:43,789
Rym: I didn't even pay attention to the fact that a new Ubuntu was gonna be coming out anytime soon Because dapper Drake was pretty good.

85
00:05:44,113 --> 00:05:51,690
Rym: I was very happy with it And I just didn't expect that the line of desktop Linux would have been crossed with such a little fanfare.

86
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:57,850
Rym: This Linux this Ubuntu Ubuntu is pretty much above the line as far as I'm concerned.

87
00:05:57,951 --> 00:06:06,170
Scott: I would give this to my parents without a second thought The only that like let me count the ways in which it improves upon dapper Drake.

88
00:06:07,014 --> 00:06:09,750
Rym: I got the big one that I want to say right now because it's gonna jump out of me.

89
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,119
Rym: All right sound works like it does in Windows.

90
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:17,850
Rym: It just doesn't work like it does in that It just freaking works and it sees all your sound card.

91
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,770
Scott: It works like a million times better than it did before.

92
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:34,635
Scott: There was a problem in Linux in which if you had more than one sound card or if you had Sound cards with multiple devices like for example my sound card it has analog holes Which normal speaker holes.

93
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:44,114
Scott: it also has an optical hole, you know for the fancy surround sound optical cables the digital TOS link whatever and That's a separate device.

94
00:06:44,174 --> 00:06:51,772
Scott: That's device 0 comma 2 whereas the normal sound card is device 0 comma 1 or 0 comma 0.

95
00:06:51,772 --> 00:07:02,578
Scott: Ubuntu Edgy F just detected it automatically and works and it also has a new dialog box that allows me to manually choose That particular hole.

96
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:13,510
Rym: now while Scott's right and that it's not exactly like Windows I guess my point is that for most of you out there at least 90% of you It's functionally just like Windows because you won't have to do anything.

97
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,971
Scott: Yeah There are.

98
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:18,670
Scott: there was a huge problem and people having to jump through hoops to get their sound cards to work.

99
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,432
Scott: That is gone.

100
00:07:20,054 --> 00:07:24,910
Scott: Also people who want to use that crazy AI GLX fancy 3d shit.

101
00:07:25,152 --> 00:07:25,859
Scott: It's now 10,000 times easier.

102
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:41,202
Scott: All the software that you probably want to use like Banshee, which is almost equivalent to iTunes It's basically 90% exactly the same as iTunes new cache the thing that's basically like quicken.

103
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:45,738
Scott: all that that software has been Updated to the newest versions.

104
00:07:45,818 --> 00:08:01,229
Scott: dapper Drake didn't have that stuff updated to the newest versions so you were stuck using version like 10 when version 11 is out and a version 11 is 10,000 times better than version 10. and not only that but Ubuntu comes.

105
00:08:01,812 --> 00:08:09,383
Scott: Edgy F comes with the real version of Firefox 2 with the right icon And it's the real deal.

106
00:08:09,463 --> 00:08:10,469
Rym: take that ice weasel.

107
00:08:10,812 --> 00:08:15,875
Scott: It is the real Firefox 2 from Mozilla Unmodified beat.

108
00:08:15,915 --> 00:08:18,061
Scott: that beat that I didn't have to do shit.

109
00:08:18,222 --> 00:08:20,467
Scott: It was just there today today.

110
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:23,203
Rym: Oh, no Yeah, we got it.

111
00:08:23,464 --> 00:08:25,590
Rym: Scott's got a thing of the day that's coming up for Tuesday.

112
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:34,249
Scott: I could say a lot more awesome things about why edgy EFT is a thousand times better than dapper Drake But I'll tell you a few of the bad things just just to round it out.

113
00:08:34,912 --> 00:08:35,595
Scott: It's still.

114
00:08:35,956 --> 00:08:39,590
Scott: if you want to have dual monitors, you still have to jump through a few hoops.

115
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:40,775
Scott: It's not super simple.

116
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:41,960
Rym: Yeah as opposed to Windows.

117
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,410
Rym: We're honestly it just works without any effort.

118
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,806
Rym: Yeah, though you can't do everything you want to do, but it works.

119
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:47,410
Scott: It's a good thing.

120
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:51,881
Scott: I know how to set up dual monitors And yeah, but other people don't know.

121
00:08:51,961 --> 00:08:53,005
Scott: so it might be a little tricky.

122
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:54,350
Scott: They have to edit a text file.

123
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,601
Scott: Oh, I had to add like a few lines to a text file.

124
00:08:57,841 --> 00:08:59,326
Rym: God kind of Superman.

125
00:08:59,346 --> 00:09:00,189
Rym: Do you think we are?

126
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,590
Scott: Gnome screensaver is still the default screensavers.

127
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:08,730
Scott: You have to uninstall it and install X screensaver to get a real screensaver program going on.

128
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,956
Rym: Yeah, it's easy to do.

129
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:10,660
Scott: It's not.

130
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,309
Scott: it's not difficult in the least.

131
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:15,317
Scott: and What was the other problem I had?

132
00:09:15,718 --> 00:09:16,823
Rym: were there any other problems?

133
00:09:16,883 --> 00:09:17,385
Scott: there was?

134
00:09:17,465 --> 00:09:18,590
Scott: it was just so minor.

135
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:19,172
Scott: I didn't.

136
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,959
Scott: I don't really remember it right now.

137
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,524
Rym: If you don't like brown.

138
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,688
Rym: It's still kind of brown.

139
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,234
Scott: Yeah It's still kind of ugly.

140
00:09:25,254 --> 00:09:29,330
Scott: You have to go to gnome look org and get a new theme that you easily install.

141
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:30,614
Scott: You know it.

142
00:09:31,295 --> 00:09:34,645
Scott: it's pretty much dapper Drake with a lot of problems fixed.

143
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:36,390
Scott: a lot of problems fixed.

144
00:09:37,072 --> 00:09:40,567
Scott: If you oh right wireless cards are still hit or miss.

145
00:09:40,908 --> 00:09:45,507
Rym: of course That's not the fault of anything other than the wireless card manufacturers.

146
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:49,589
Scott: Yeah Yeah, but if you have a wireless card that just works it just works.

147
00:09:50,231 --> 00:09:53,880
Rym: Yeah, luckily not as many people put Linux on their laptops as the desktop.

148
00:09:54,041 --> 00:10:00,350
Scott: actually you'd be surprised that all the questions I get are people trying to put Linux on laptops.

149
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:01,760
Rym: Yeah, cuz that's what's hard.

150
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:07,740
Scott: a lot of people don't bother well And also a lot of people get the old laptops for cheap And they try to put Linux on it.

151
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,030
Scott: cuz you can't put Windows on there.

152
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:25,134
Rym: Yeah, you can know all the old laptops come with a spyware infected version of Windows 2000. great Possibly a spyware infected version of Windows 95 a. oh yeah You realize I had Windows 95 a. I ran to the point that when B came out I did not update.

153
00:10:25,836 --> 00:10:31,279
Scott: see I went from Windows 3.1 to 95 B. Wow Because I had USBs.

154
00:10:33,071 --> 00:10:33,813
Rym: See I didn't.

155
00:10:34,354 --> 00:10:36,439
Scott: yeah a lot of people don't know this.

156
00:10:36,499 --> 00:10:39,607
Scott: Windows 95 a couldn't use USB ports.

157
00:10:39,687 --> 00:10:44,940
Rym: Windows 95 B Could kinda use USB or kind of being the operative word.

158
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,870
Scott: that wasn't until Windows 2000 that USB worked for real.

159
00:10:49,652 --> 00:11:03,999
Rym: It was kind of scary things of the day Man, it felt real good to say that loud again to not have to worry about clipping or anything.

160
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:09,767
Scott: Yeah, it's a. it's a good feeling to just be able to say what you want to say how you want to say it with No worries.

161
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:17,620
Scott: Oh, yeah And imagine trying to have free speech when you can't say you know or else it'll get screwed up.

162
00:11:17,901 --> 00:11:19,347
Rym: You know yeah Michael.

163
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:24,969
Rym: You know yeah, all right, so stay the course All right, I think in my course.

164
00:11:24,989 --> 00:11:25,772
Rym: I think I'm GeekNights.

165
00:11:25,812 --> 00:11:27,400
Rym: We really need to sort of to the left.

166
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:29,410
Rym: Oh, no see we got to stay the course.

167
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,446
Rym: my strategy all along has been to stay the course All right.

168
00:11:32,928 --> 00:11:35,340
Rym: actually no my strategy was never to stay the course.

169
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:38,180
Scott: Well, what was it all right now?

170
00:11:38,762 --> 00:11:42,020
Rym: We don't always get that political other than when we you know yell about politics.

171
00:11:42,823 --> 00:11:44,329
Rym: Oh, but I'm not.

172
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:50,449
Rym: this isn't a thing of the day for a political reason Regardless of any of our listeners or our feelings about it.

173
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,601
Rym: my thing of the day is this ad put out by the Democratic National Committee.

174
00:11:55,343 --> 00:12:08,386
Rym: now it shows video actual video of our dear leader President Bush saying that in Iraq We have to stay the course and it shows him saying it dozens of times over the course of years in different situations And interviews.

175
00:12:09,071 --> 00:12:17,760
Rym: all right then When it shows a very recent one where he says very clearly my strategy was never to stay the course.

176
00:12:18,962 --> 00:12:20,390
Scott: Maybe he was lying before.

177
00:12:20,732 --> 00:12:22,764
Rym: well the thing is oh the.

178
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:29,540
Rym: a lot of times in recent memory a lot of the Republican and I don't really want to use right and left because that doesn't really fit.

179
00:12:29,962 --> 00:12:53,367
Rym: But the Republican current non normal conservative neoconservative Republican rhetoric has typically been to accuse people on the other side of being liars all the time or equating them with the enemy or whatever, but historically Democrats and Not left-wingers, but you know what I mean tend to be Tend to not fight back so strongly.

180
00:12:53,407 --> 00:13:09,280
Rym: it's rare to see someone who isn't on the neoconservative side attack someone and I was very surprised to see this ad put out by the Democratic National Committee That pretty much in video straight up calls out a Republican for lying.

181
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:18,126
Scott: It kind of reminds me of how an eagle they hire the guy who's usually the campaign guy for the Republicans To work on his campaign.

182
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:23,080
Scott: Oh, yeah, so uses the Republican getting elected strategy in the Democratic campaign.

183
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:36,900
Rym: I mean, I guess if nothing else I really want to see a lot more Both sides of our government actually taking the other side to task when they do something wrong Or they say something bad or they lie.

184
00:13:37,213 --> 00:13:38,444
Scott: Yeah I mean it's one thing.

185
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:43,783
Scott: when we had like the negative campaign ads and everyone was like all these negative campaign ads suck You want the positive ones?

186
00:13:43,903 --> 00:13:45,889
Scott: Well, yeah, that's true that.

187
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:53,931
Scott: but the problem was is the negative campaign ads of the past were all So and so didn't blah so and so blah blah blah.

188
00:13:53,991 --> 00:13:55,375
Scott: It's just like name-calling.

189
00:13:55,395 --> 00:13:56,518
Scott: It's like he's a doodoo head.

190
00:13:56,578 --> 00:13:57,080
Scott: vote for me.

191
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,106
Scott: Yeah, the other guy sucks vote for me.

192
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:09,040
Scott: This is let's show in video, you know Demonstrating someone else lying because you could do this for any politician in all of Washington.

193
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,745
Scott: You can make a video just like this.

194
00:14:11,086 --> 00:14:12,470
Scott: So I want to see all those videos.

195
00:14:13,401 --> 00:14:17,996
Scott: Yeah, maybe it'll get people riled up because you really can't argue with it.

196
00:14:18,036 --> 00:14:18,437
Scott: It's like there.

197
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:18,839
Scott: he is there.

198
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:19,220
Scott: he lied.

199
00:14:19,623 --> 00:14:20,509
Scott: What are you gonna do about it?

200
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:24,030
Scott: It's like when I watched What was that movie?

201
00:14:24,312 --> 00:14:24,937
Scott: outfoxed.

202
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:26,899
Scott: Oh, yeah, like I don't watch TV.

203
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:29,852
Scott: So I didn't realize Fox News was that biased.

204
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:34,119
Scott: like people said shit all the time I didn't pay attention because I didn't watch news on TV.

205
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:34,802
Scott: I still don't.

206
00:14:35,264 --> 00:14:38,758
Scott: but I watched and there was that guy and they showed him saying shut up.

207
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:44,820
Scott: Shut up You know, they showed him saying I didn't tell I never tell anyone to shut up and then they showed for like five minutes.

208
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,403
Scott: All he did was say shut up.

209
00:14:46,463 --> 00:14:46,724
Scott: Shut up.

210
00:14:46,764 --> 00:14:47,045
Scott: Shut up.

211
00:14:47,065 --> 00:14:58,245
Scott: shot as he told guests on his show to shut up And I was just laughing hysterically and I was like, oh Okay Now this isn't a partisan issue any politician.

212
00:14:58,285 --> 00:14:59,409
Rym: I want to see this happen, too.

213
00:14:59,951 --> 00:15:06,910
Rym: In fact, were I in some crazy alternate bizarro world to run for president of the United States?

214
00:15:07,332 --> 00:15:09,341
Rym: Or if someone awesome were to run?

215
00:15:09,844 --> 00:15:20,544
Rym: I would love to see someone Pledge that if they were elected any time they spoke to the American people at a press conference or publicly They would first have themselves put under oath by a judge.

216
00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:21,629
Scott: That's what I would do.

217
00:15:22,392 --> 00:15:28,007
Rym: I mean imagine that I would love to see anyone have the pure testicular fortitude to do that.

218
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:36,610
Scott: I Would definitely do it right away because as soon as you do that, you know you stick to it and you you got huge balls.

219
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:42,348
Scott: But then with the real long-lasting effect is let's say the president does it and the guy's president.

220
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:47,330
Scott: for eight years He's not president anymore then someone else's president and they don't do it.

221
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:50,843
Scott: They don't swear under oath every time they speak in public.

222
00:15:51,565 --> 00:15:52,770
Scott: aren't people gonna say, huh?

223
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,817
Scott: How come you didn't do do it?

224
00:15:54,857 --> 00:15:56,747
Scott: The last guy did he didn't lie to us.

225
00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:03,310
Scott: now You can't lie to us either and the guy's like, oh shit It forces every president to have giant nuts.

226
00:16:03,651 --> 00:16:05,558
Scott: If just one president has giant nuts.

227
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:13,490
Scott: or you know, if a congressman does it then you know Everyone will start expecting other people to do it also or governor or anyone.

228
00:16:13,631 --> 00:16:15,166
Rym: It has another interesting effect in that.

229
00:16:15,227 --> 00:16:23,975
Rym: now I mean currently it's not illegal to lie in this country unless you're like on court or unless you're Slandering or libel anger.

230
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:24,638
Rym: Well, yeah.

231
00:16:24,658 --> 00:16:25,139
Rym: Yeah all that.

232
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:29,013
Rym: but in general, I mean if I asked Scott Scott How are you doing today?

233
00:16:29,034 --> 00:16:31,161
Rym: And Scott says purple monkey dishwasher.

234
00:16:31,462 --> 00:16:32,345
Scott: That's not lying.

235
00:16:32,385 --> 00:16:37,004
Scott: That's just dodging the question Yeah, which is lying would be saying great when I was feeling like shit.

236
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:38,450
Rym: Yeah, but people do that all the time.

237
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,233
Rym: It's not against the law.

238
00:16:39,514 --> 00:16:40,639
Scott: No perfectly legal.

239
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,490
Rym: The president should be perfectly legal can lie to the people.

240
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,190
Rym: There's no no legal reason.

241
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:50,225
Rym: He can't say whatever he wants other than a few specific exceptions to the people

242
00:16:51,028 --> 00:17:00,390
Scott: and in some cases He probably should lie, you know I mean Let's say someone asked him a question and it would look really bad if he didn't answer the question at all and just dodged it.

243
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:05,571
Scott: But saying the true answer could be dangerous Like like.

244
00:17:06,253 --> 00:17:12,489
Rym: is it true that we have a spy named John Smith in North Korea ready to assassinate Kim Jong-il and he's like?

245
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:16,058
Rym: No, it's not true.

246
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:21,420
Scott: Yeah, I mean he can't say no comment because then people go Unless.

247
00:17:21,481 --> 00:17:22,929
Rym: now there's the whole no comment thing.

248
00:17:23,652 --> 00:17:27,009
Rym: There are government's policies to always say no comment about anything like that.

249
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:32,390
Rym: That way it's not if they say no comment all the time that them saying no comment doesn't mean anything.

250
00:17:32,611 --> 00:17:34,858
Scott: Yeah, I know but you get the idea.

251
00:17:34,898 --> 00:17:37,326
Scott: there are occasions we're saying no account you.

252
00:17:37,427 --> 00:17:38,330
Scott: it's better just say no.

253
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:46,630
Rym: But now I mean Congress can't easily Impeach a president just for lying at a press conference the way it's currently set up.

254
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,570
Rym: He has to do something illegal essentially.

255
00:17:49,072 --> 00:17:57,690
Scott: But if he swears to not lie with under oath with a judge Then if he lies during the press conference after being under oath, well, then that's a perjury.

256
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:04,357
Rym: I mean, I I swear I did not have sex with that woman Monica Lewinsky And you know, normally I used.

257
00:18:04,477 --> 00:18:13,630
Scott: I would think I'm not a hundred percent sure on what the the law is for perjury And while I would think that you know, it only counts if you're testifying in a court.

258
00:18:14,373 --> 00:18:18,430
Scott: It counts when the president's you know, swearing to uphold the Constitution is inauguration.

259
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,790
Scott: Yeah, so why wouldn't it count if he did it any time?

260
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:27,466
Rym: Well, the the simple truth is that in reality Congress can impeach a president for any goddamn reason.

261
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:28,990
Rym: They feel like yeah.

262
00:18:29,211 --> 00:18:29,993
Rym: I mean remember when.

263
00:18:30,153 --> 00:18:35,830
Rym: well not remember cuz we weren't around when Johnson was impeached back in reconstruction days.

264
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:38,635
Rym: Yep, yeah.

265
00:18:38,755 --> 00:18:38,856
Rym: Yep.

266
00:18:38,876 --> 00:18:39,980
Rym: All right, whatever.

267
00:18:40,021 --> 00:18:40,864
Rym: You've got a thing of the day.

268
00:18:40,904 --> 00:18:41,346
Rym: Do you not?

269
00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:42,190
Scott: All right.

270
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,878
Scott: So seeing as Halloween's coming real quick.

271
00:18:45,379 --> 00:18:46,362
Scott: It's coming Tuesday.

272
00:18:46,944 --> 00:18:48,709
Scott: I got a little Halloween thing of the day.

273
00:18:49,091 --> 00:18:49,837
Scott: Oh, really?

274
00:18:49,897 --> 00:18:51,509
Scott: I don't think this is a real commercial.

275
00:18:51,851 --> 00:18:59,390
Scott: He could mainly cuz the guy says fuck a lot, but it could be real I guess super late night TV cable TV somewhere.

276
00:19:00,692 --> 00:19:07,513
Scott: This is an ad for I assume a not real Clothing store.

277
00:19:07,554 --> 00:19:09,017
Scott: well costume store.

278
00:19:09,117 --> 00:19:12,386
Scott: Basically, it's a girl's costume warehouse.

279
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:17,443
Scott: It is is real Scuzzy, New York salesman kind of guy.

280
00:19:17,464 --> 00:19:22,261
Scott: Yeah sexy nesses And he's like we got every kind of girl's costume.

Scott: we got sexy nurse sexy nun Sexy cat, you know sexy every sexy devil.

282
00:19:28,924 --> 00:19:30,570
Rym: You can't wear sexy costumes.

283
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:38,055
Scott: You can't wear ten sexy costumes and the guys like it's so hilarious cuz the guys like Come on down here.

284
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:40,020
Scott: I got some fucking costumes to sell.

00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,848
Rym: I got a big fucking sale going on here.

286

Rym: Come on Come on Come on.

287
00:19:47,491 --> 00:19:48,855
Scott: It's pretty funny commercial.

288
00:19:49,116 --> 00:19:54,270
Scott: Thank you College Humor for yet again being a great selector of internet humorous videos.

289
00:19:54,491 --> 00:19:55,597
Rym: Yeah, I mean College Humor.

290
00:19:55,638 --> 00:20:03,330
Rym: we perused it fairly often in college But it was only when we were really bored and we wanted low resolution videos of people getting hit in the balls.

291
00:20:03,673 --> 00:20:04,925
Scott: Yeah, there wasn't much to it.

292
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:17,765
Scott: nowadays It seems to be that it's not a YouTube or a Google video, but what it is, it's sort of a really awesome They picking really good ones really often, you know, they had what other good ones did.

293
00:20:17,785 --> 00:20:19,690
Scott: they have recently the Street Fighter thing.

294
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:20,395
Scott: That's right.

295
00:20:20,455 --> 00:20:23,729
Scott: The Street Fighter with that's the one Don't see.

296
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:38,489
Rym: Okay So it's considering that Halloween falls on a gaming day and it's also the beginning of season two We figure today Thursday the Thursday before the holiday Halloween weekend that we would talk about.

297
00:20:53,291 --> 00:21:08,280
Rym: Oh Yeah, now sadly I actually haven't really had a chance to celebrate Halloween much since I left high school.

298
00:21:08,822 --> 00:21:11,972
Scott: I haven't had a chance to celebrate much since I got into high school.

299
00:21:12,073 --> 00:21:12,855
Rym: I mean at RIT.

300
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,160
Rym: We never celebrated it.

301
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,640
Rym: We just kind of some people who wear costumes.

302
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,596
Rym: We had the big cosplay at the anime club, which I could I have some stories from.

303
00:21:20,616 --> 00:21:29,965
Scott: yeah I think actually I heard somewhere recently the Halloween is the fastest growing holiday yet at the same time It's the fastest dying holiday.

304
00:21:30,186 --> 00:21:32,976
Rym: from what I've seen fewer kids trick-or-treat now than ever.

305
00:21:32,996 --> 00:21:34,461
Scott: I Don't know.

306
00:21:34,481 --> 00:21:43,539
Scott: I think it really depends on the area that you're in and the time of day and the type of people You know, I mean it seems like the suburban Protect your kid.

307
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:50,540
Scott: Crazies are not letting their kids go out because they're really afraid and they'll drive their kids around in their cars during the day.

308
00:21:51,322 --> 00:22:09,839
Scott: But in areas where people are all cool, and they're not you know afraid of the outside world You know The kids are go super like the kids that do trick-or-treat are doing a badass job of it like they'll go to an apartment complex and do the whole thing just Every single place to get a zillion candies.

309
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:17,727
Rym: Well, actually when I grew up in Detroit, I mean when we lived in Detroit straight up You couldn't go trick-or-treating around the neighborhood.

310
00:22:18,028 --> 00:22:28,678
Rym: So it was kind of funny and sad at the same time, but all the more Not really affluent, but all the people who were afraid of the neighborhood would leave and

311
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:29,220
Scott: on Halloween

312
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:40,953
Rym: They'd go to Lakeside Mall in the suburbs and they set up a Halloween there where all the stores had candy And they all the kids would come and trick-or-treat at the mall instead of walking around downtown Detroit.

313
00:22:41,274 --> 00:22:49,331
Scott: Yeah, our mall always had All kinds of trick-or-treating going on But I only think we only did that once most of the time.

314
00:22:49,351 --> 00:22:53,350
Scott: we just walked around to the same houses that we always went To and got the same candy.

315
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:53,975
Scott: We always get.

316
00:22:53,995 --> 00:22:56,069
Rym: yeah I mean I used to dress up when I was a kid.

317
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:01,394
Rym: pretty much once I hit high school I stopped dressing up entirely and I'd still go out on Halloween.

318
00:23:01,475 --> 00:23:03,967
Rym: even when I was a senior in high school I still went out on Halloween.

319
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:06,040
Rym: We didn't go trick-or-treating or anything.

320
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:12,167
Rym: We just wandered around the neighborhood or out in the woods in a small posse of punk kid Causing all sorts of punk kid trouble.

321
00:23:12,628 --> 00:23:13,210
Scott: Yeah, it seemed to.

322
00:23:13,933 --> 00:23:18,569
Scott: it looks like what's happening to me or To me, it looks like what's happened.

323
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,013
Scott: I don't know how to say this at all.

324
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:20,916
Rym: All right, where's mr.

325
00:23:20,956 --> 00:23:21,960
Rym: Period when you really needed?

326
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,428
Scott: Yeah, seriously, mr.

327
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,779
Rym: Shoots and leaves.

328
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,692
Scott: lingual Isn't dead lingual is dead.

329
00:23:29,893 --> 00:23:30,396
Rym: Good job.

330
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:31,962
Scott: Yeah Great.

331
00:23:31,982 --> 00:23:49,587
Scott: so it seems like what's happening to Halloween is that there's a lot less kids trick-or-treating actually going on But there's a lot more 20 30 year olds going out and having parties and getting costumes like they're selling a lot more costumes to Adults and college people now.

332
00:23:49,827 --> 00:23:56,139
Scott: Yeah, they're having parties and there's a lot less kids trick-or-treating going on Even though that still does happen a lot.

333
00:23:56,641 --> 00:24:04,628
Rym: Yeah, I got to say the last time I actually dressed up for Halloween was I believe it might have actually been my senior year High school, but I want him in my junior year.

334
00:24:04,668 --> 00:24:06,838
Rym: I don't remember but I dressed up as dr.

335
00:24:06,898 --> 00:24:07,260
Rym: Jekyll.

336
00:24:07,661 --> 00:24:15,847
Rym: I wasn't actually gonna dress up, but I decided at the last second because I was nominally going to a party with someone I knew I should probably dress up.

337
00:24:16,408 --> 00:24:20,200
Rym: So I took you know my suit and keep saying, you know, see what you did to me.

338
00:24:20,865 --> 00:24:22,359
Rym: No, no and some black pants.

339
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:27,394
Rym: You can't say 10, you know I put on a fancy three-piece suit and then I put a black cape on over it.

340
00:24:27,414 --> 00:24:37,419
Rym: cuz I had a nice cape and I Borrowed one of my mom's walking like nice fancy silver-headed walking canes and I just said I was dr Jekyll and everyone thought it was a really good costume.

341
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:45,120
Scott: Okay Yeah, I think I must have dressed up at some of those anime club things in college for the Halloween costume contest.

342
00:24:45,341 --> 00:24:47,131
Rym: I don't remember you ever actually dressing up.

343
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:48,720
Scott: I think I did a couple times.

344
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,710
Rym: You dressed up as a katani when we were freshmen.

345
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,780
Scott: that was a good plan to katani costume.

346
00:24:52,902 --> 00:24:53,879
Scott: Yeah, that worked well.

347
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,509
Scott: But I think I don't know if I did.

348
00:24:56,609 --> 00:24:58,779
Scott: it wasn't like I went trick-or-treating or anything.

349
00:24:59,504 --> 00:25:02,100
Rym: I thought I think we do more cosplaying than we do Halloween.

350
00:25:02,241 --> 00:25:06,460
Scott: I think it's not a really remember and it most of my costumes from when I was a kid.

351
00:25:06,701 --> 00:25:20,695
Scott: I think once I you know what I had a lot in elementary school I would have those costumes where you would just buy at the store in a little box and it came with a plastic mask Of the rubber band that would go around your head and then like a big plastic thing.

352
00:25:20,715 --> 00:25:22,020
Scott: You would just pull over your body.

353
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:26,194
Rym: Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld is a whole thing in his stand-up about that.

354
00:25:26,615 --> 00:25:27,137
Scott: Yeah, I had.

355
00:25:27,177 --> 00:25:28,140
Scott: let's see which ones that I have.

356
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:29,206
Scott: I still have some of these.

357
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:30,312
Scott: I was Voltron once.

358
00:25:30,372 --> 00:25:31,398
Scott: that was the best one.

359
00:25:31,498 --> 00:25:35,693
Scott: Wow I was Voltron with big plastic Voltron mask and a Voltron suit.

360
00:25:35,853 --> 00:25:37,659
Scott: See when I was I was a centurion.

361
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:37,920
Scott: once.

362
00:25:38,321 --> 00:25:40,869
Rym: I think we both had the exact same centurion cost.

363
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:43,217
Scott: I think I still have that centurion costume.

364
00:25:43,498 --> 00:25:44,160
Rym: I have it somewhere.

365
00:25:45,445 --> 00:25:47,160
Rym: Wait, you had the other one with the red missile.

366
00:25:48,141 --> 00:25:50,087
Scott: No, I was the yellow guy with the green.

367
00:25:50,408 --> 00:25:52,054
Rym: I was the blue guy with the red missile.

368
00:25:52,294 --> 00:26:00,380
Rym: Yeah, the missile was just this Phallic looking piece of plastic that stuck on the arm and to shoot it You pulled it off the arm and you threw it at your little brother.

369
00:26:00,701 --> 00:26:05,560
Scott: I think one year I was a Robin Hood or something or a merry man or a forest, dude.

370
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:06,483
Rym: Actually, you know what?

371
00:26:06,503 --> 00:26:07,046
Scott: It's like my leg.

372
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:10,620
Rym: I suddenly remembered the full chronology of all my costumes.

373
00:26:10,961 --> 00:26:13,552
Rym: All right, shoot out of the blue the first costume I can remember.

374
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:18,060
Rym: my parents dressed me up as raggedy Andy Oh pun when I was a little kid.

375
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,305
Rym: I think they still have the costume.

376
00:26:20,047 --> 00:26:23,520
Rym: and then my mom actually made my brother and I we wanted to be Ghostbusters.

377
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,686
Rym: instead of buying.

378
00:26:26,047 --> 00:26:32,851
Scott: I was just gonna say I can't remember if I actually did a Ghostbusters costume or just everyone else in the world did one and not me.

379
00:26:33,353 --> 00:26:35,700
Rym: now all my friends also dressed up as Ghostbusters.

380
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,412
Scott: It was like some one year where Ghostbuster was the costume to be.

381
00:26:39,452 --> 00:26:39,914
Scott: here's the thing.

382
00:26:40,034 --> 00:26:41,860
Scott: everyone in the world had a proton pack.

383
00:26:42,141 --> 00:26:47,739
Rym: Everyone I knew who was a Ghostbuster just bought a plastic proton pack and bought the car.

384
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:56,725
Scott: No I think if I did do a Ghostbusters costume because I don't remember if I did one or not I did I still have the plastic proton bag So I think I would have used it.

385
00:26:57,066 --> 00:27:06,404
Scott: but everyone else I knew was making proton packs like everyone had different proton packs of varying shapes and sizes and duct tape and cardboard and God-knows-what.

386
00:27:06,464 --> 00:27:22,220
Rym: I think it's the areas we lived because where I was everyone bought it except my mom was awesome And she made my brother and I perfectly accurate to the movie Ghostbusters costumes right down to the name tags and a uniform and the proton pack was badass.

387
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:29,838
Scott: Say if we had Skype right now I would call my mom because she probably remembers every single Halloween costume I ever wore and she could just tell us.

388
00:27:30,078 --> 00:27:40,239
Rym: Yeah So then I dressed up after that as an army man With a little 45 and Everyone else was also dressed up as an army man.

389
00:27:40,902 --> 00:27:47,260
Scott: Oh, I remember my last Halloween costume as I went to the to the store and I got one of those rubber masks.

390
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,672
Scott: you know that covers your whole head and has hair on it.

391
00:27:50,355 --> 00:27:54,571
Scott: and I bought the Sickest ugliest one I could find like it was.

392
00:27:54,611 --> 00:27:56,740
Scott: so it was like it's scared with my little sister.

393
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,204
Scott: She was like don't put it on.

394
00:27:58,285 --> 00:28:03,259
Scott: Oh my god, and I wore that for like all around town and people would be like you.

395
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:07,218
Scott: I Just bought the scariest mask at the store.

396
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:12,480
Rym: So after the army man, I wanted now this dates me in terms of my anime fandom.

397
00:28:12,862 --> 00:28:14,549
Rym: This was I think this was fourth grade.

398
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:17,902
Rym: I wanted to be vampire hunter D Oh.

399
00:28:18,003 --> 00:28:22,500
Rym: and my mom tried to convince me that no one would know what the hell I was and I shouldn't bother.

400
00:28:24,264 --> 00:28:26,438
Rym: And then I thought oh I'll just make the costume on my own.

401
00:28:26,459 --> 00:28:41,840
Rym: and I don't know what my little kid brain was thinking because I assumed that I would look exactly Like D when I when I made a costume, you know, it's really weird though and all my years as a kid You know kids who dress up as Ninja Turtles.

402
00:28:42,444 --> 00:28:44,237
Scott: They dress up is you know?

403
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,444
Scott: Transformers and okay.

404
00:28:46,946 --> 00:28:47,588
Scott: No one.

405
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:52,105
Scott: I don't remember a single kid ever dressing up as Mario ever Do you?

406
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:54,058
Scott: I think I remember Sonic the Hedgehog's?

407
00:28:54,621 --> 00:28:58,920
Rym: Actually, I remember two different kids who dressed up as link and my little brother one.

408
00:28:59,121 --> 00:28:59,744
Scott: There were links.

409
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:00,568
Scott: there were links.

410
00:29:00,668 --> 00:29:02,034
Scott: there were no Mario's.

411
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,240
Scott: do you remember a Mario ever?

412
00:29:06,902 --> 00:29:13,160
Scott: Like I hadn't seen no one did a Mario costume until recently when it was all cool with the cosplay action at the conventions.

413
00:29:13,804 --> 00:29:18,302
Rym: Yeah, the cosplay action that Daryl Surratt is trying to Undermine.

414
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:20,067
Scott: Yeah, they're really.

415
00:29:20,669 --> 00:29:22,635
Scott: it's kind of weird because now that I think about it.

416
00:29:22,655 --> 00:29:24,300
Scott: It's like wow, I should have been Mario.

417
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,566
Scott: How could I not have been Mario?

418
00:29:26,687 --> 00:29:31,320
Rym: see it's weird because we didn't see our video game culture as special when we were kids.

419
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,465
Rym: It wasn't nostalgic.

420
00:29:32,485 --> 00:29:33,429
Rym: It wasn't awesome.

421
00:29:33,509 --> 00:29:34,372
Rym: It wasn't even cool.

422
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:36,099
Rym: It was just the way you were.

423
00:29:36,622 --> 00:29:37,766
Rym: Everyone was that way.

424
00:29:37,987 --> 00:29:40,980
Scott: Yeah, but Voltron wasn't special either, but I dressed up as him.

425
00:29:41,843 --> 00:29:42,586
Rym: I don't know what it was.

426
00:29:42,626 --> 00:29:45,436
Rym: I think maybe it was because there weren't Mario costumes.

427
00:29:45,476 --> 00:29:46,419
Rym: No one thought of it.

428
00:29:46,741 --> 00:29:47,664
Scott: I don't know man.

429
00:29:47,824 --> 00:29:51,777
Scott: I don't know cuz Mario all dressed up as Ghostbusters and those weren't nostalgic.

430
00:29:51,797 --> 00:29:52,480
Scott: They're brand new.

431
00:29:53,162 --> 00:29:53,563
Rym: I don't know.

432
00:29:53,623 --> 00:29:59,880
Rym: Maybe it's because video games were just so ingrained and so part of our daily ritualized lives.

433
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:01,427
Scott: I don't know there.

434
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:06,708
Scott: I feel like there should have been a Mario costume back though Since I didn't dress up as vampire hunter D.

435
00:30:06,728 --> 00:30:07,130
Rym: What do you think?

436
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:10,300
Rym: I dressed up as you'll never guess vampire hunter D's hand.

437
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:11,325
Rym: No, oh god.

438
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:12,169
Rym: I wish I was that clever.

439
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:15,243
Rym: No, actually my brother and I dressed up as Arabs Uh-huh.

440
00:30:15,584 --> 00:30:17,752
Rym: Now the reason that might sound odd.

441
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:20,040
Rym: my grandparents traveled extensively.

442
00:30:20,482 --> 00:30:22,589
Rym: I mean they spent a long time in Australia.

443
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:25,480
Rym: They very seriously considered emigrating there.

444
00:30:25,841 --> 00:30:27,547
Rym: They spent a lot of time in the Middle East in Egypt.

445
00:30:27,587 --> 00:30:42,435
Rym: And while they were there they bought full silken wondrous garments and they brought my size my little brother's size and they brought them back and We wore them that Halloween because they were authentic clothing silk and awesome.

446
00:30:42,756 --> 00:30:44,704
Rym: They were the most comfortable things I've ever worn.

447
00:30:44,825 --> 00:30:47,720
Scott: we should dress up as Arabs and just walk around town on Halloween.

448
00:30:48,121 --> 00:30:48,523
Rym: You know what?

449
00:30:48,603 --> 00:30:50,310
Rym: I don't want to spend Halloween in Gitmo.

450
00:30:50,852 --> 00:30:51,916
Scott: I know seriously.

451
00:30:51,936 --> 00:30:59,992
Scott: Yeah, it's fucked up Seriously fucked up, you know, seriously, you know, it's seriously fucked up, you know Serious, you know, yeah.

452
00:31:02,623 --> 00:31:12,579
Scott: It seems now though that any time a costume comes up It's always a video game or an anime like or possibly an underwear pervert, but it's all video game anime costumes.

453
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:13,378
Scott: now What's up?

454
00:31:13,761 --> 00:31:24,368
Rym: I have not dressed up in a non video game anime costume since I got out of high school With the possible exception of the lamest costume I ever wore Which is well when I went to the st.

455
00:31:24,409 --> 00:31:29,987
Rym: Mark's holiday or Halloween parade with Emily a while ago I didn't really have a costume.

456
00:31:30,428 --> 00:31:34,300
Rym: So I nominally dressed up as a pirate by wearing a pirate van.

457
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:35,526
Scott: Oh, yeah, I guess pirate.

458
00:31:35,566 --> 00:31:37,416
Scott: Yeah, not pirate is also included.

459
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:46,599
Rym: and ninja I wore black blue black jeans a Pirate bandana with the skull and bones on it and a shirt with a skull and bones on it.

460
00:31:47,121 --> 00:31:49,086
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much pirate.

461
00:31:49,146 --> 00:31:49,507
Scott: ninja.

462
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:57,567
Scott: anime video games occasionally comic books and that covers 99% of costumes besides the generic skeleton.

463
00:31:58,052 --> 00:32:03,357
Scott: sexy which sexy devil sexy Ness sexy nun.

464
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:22,615
Rym: Yeah Though in terms of I mean one fun story about me and dressing up as things is that at the RIT anime club We had a tradition of having the Halloween costume contest Which was basically a mini cosplay totally off-the-cuff voted on by the people in the crowd.

465
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:25,203
Rym: not terribly official or anything But it was always great fun.

466
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:26,026
Rym: It was Halloween.

467
00:32:26,066 --> 00:32:27,129
Scott: So we had a showing.

468
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:30,340
Scott: anyway, you know, whichever Thursday was closest to Halloween.

469
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:34,135
Scott: We had a meeting where we showed an anime that was usually Halloween related.

470
00:32:34,216 --> 00:32:44,427
Scott: take the x-train Yeah, so all we did was we said hey on the Thursday closest to Halloween wear a costume to club and we had all the people in costume line up.

471
00:32:44,868 --> 00:32:52,134
Scott: they all you know took a step forward one at a time and Then everyone voted on which costume was the best and someone won a prize.

472
00:32:52,475 --> 00:32:56,094
Rym: now freshman year I didn't dress up as all at all because I had no reason to.

473
00:32:56,154 --> 00:32:57,080
Rym: I didn't need to whatever.

474
00:32:57,845 --> 00:33:01,647
Rym: After that, I was on the executive board of the club So I had to dress up.

475
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:08,279
Rym: the thing is I didn't have any time I didn't have any skill and I didn't have any money.

476
00:33:09,341 --> 00:33:16,279
Rym: Yep, so let's go through the three costumes that Rym wore at the RIT anime club.

477
00:33:16,499 --> 00:33:18,969
Scott: the Oh my god is the movie cast.

478
00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:19,250
Scott: Oh, no.

479
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,275
Rym: No, that's the second one.

480
00:33:20,536 --> 00:33:21,560
Rym: Oh see here's the thing.

481
00:33:21,742 --> 00:33:26,890
Rym: I spent less than $2 on any given one of these costumes.

482
00:33:27,231 --> 00:33:27,552
Scott: All right.

483
00:33:27,732 --> 00:33:27,993
Rym: All right.

484
00:33:28,033 --> 00:33:32,189
Rym: So first off sophomore year I was the facilities coordinator of the club.

485
00:33:32,771 --> 00:33:34,640
Rym: We were gonna dress up as what Star Ocean?

486
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:37,806
Scott: Oh, yeah It was Star Ocean and I was the dude.

487
00:33:37,867 --> 00:33:45,712
Scott: I wore rims trench coat and I bought a sweater and a white shirt at the Good Will a sweater vest and a white shirt at the good.

488
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,700
Rym: Did you even know what character you're dressed up as?

489
00:33:47,981 --> 00:33:48,663
Scott: I don't remember.

490
00:33:48,683 --> 00:33:49,225
Scott: It's the guy.

491
00:33:49,285 --> 00:33:53,843
Scott: it must be the only guy in Star Ocean with a trench coat a white shirt and a green Vest.

492
00:33:53,863 --> 00:33:56,080
Scott: he's some sort of doctor scientist guy or something.

493
00:33:56,341 --> 00:34:01,700
Rym: Meanwhile, Scott Johnson dressed up as the kid the guy who has the two dragons coming out of his bag.

494
00:34:01,781 --> 00:34:02,992
Rym: So me and Greg Hartman.

495
00:34:03,153 --> 00:34:08,639
Rym: All right We were set up to be the dragons meaning we were just stand behind him.

496
00:34:09,002 --> 00:34:11,239
Rym: So because we both didn't have money weren't a goodwill?

497
00:34:11,781 --> 00:34:18,460
Rym: I bought a $1 red sport jacket and he bought a dollar fifty blue sport jacket.

498
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:21,830
Rym: I then printed out the words were dragon in red and blue.

499
00:34:22,071 --> 00:34:24,699
Rym: We taped them to our chest and we stood behind him.

500
00:34:25,661 --> 00:34:26,042
Scott: Awesome.

501
00:34:26,444 --> 00:34:28,411
Rym: That was my first costume.

502
00:34:29,094 --> 00:34:31,141
Scott: I remember that now that was great And it was.

503
00:34:31,263 --> 00:34:33,049
Rym: it was pretty infamous for how bad it was.

504
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:38,612
Rym: So the next year around we're doing oh my goddess That's the whole eboards dressing up as oh my goddess.

505
00:34:38,733 --> 00:34:40,080
Scott: Well the movie specifically.

506
00:34:40,181 --> 00:34:43,880
Scott: Well, yeah, so there's that big bad guy who wears like the white robes and shit.

507
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,884
Scott: Yeah, sell us soap.

508
00:34:44,985 --> 00:34:51,329
Scott: So you got a big white sheet and you wrapped it around yourself and I was a little bit more ghetto than that.

509
00:34:51,570 --> 00:35:02,200
Scott: No, no, and then you had that truck the square slash diamond of White felt with blue felt glued to it and you cut a hole in the middle and put it over your head.

510
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:03,784
Rym: Well, see the thing is the.

511
00:35:04,607 --> 00:35:09,100
Rym: the sheet that I wrapped around myself was actually the curtain from the kitchen.

512
00:35:10,147 --> 00:35:11,783
Rym: Right, right I pulled the curtain.

513
00:35:11,923 --> 00:35:16,817
Rym: cuz remember I made the first costume a week in advance by buying that sport jacket the next year.

514
00:35:16,837 --> 00:35:21,680
Scott: I Got out of key made the costume the day of right before right before club.

515
00:35:22,261 --> 00:35:28,580
Rym: I got out of class and I had 45 minutes before I had to be at club setting everything up.

516
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:34,294
Rym: I made that costume Including stopping at the store on the way home from class.

517
00:35:34,896 --> 00:35:39,080
Rym: in that time It was it was the most ghetto thing in the world.

518
00:35:39,201 --> 00:35:43,280
Rym: I even took a piece of felt in the shape of that thing on his forehead and glued it to my own form.

519
00:35:43,461 --> 00:35:46,280
Scott: Yeah, you glued up a blue diamond of felt to your forehead.

520
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:52,060
Rym: I remember and here's the thing the costume actually looked pretty good from about 40 feet away.

521
00:35:52,120 --> 00:36:02,016
Scott: Yeah As long as you were far away and you couldn't see the stains on our curtains and you didn't realize that it was felt Glued together with Elmer's glue like from the back of the club.

522
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:02,980
Scott: the thing looked great.

523
00:36:03,543 --> 00:36:11,497
Rym: Yeah, until you got up to me and you realize that hey that's just Peeling felt and you're wearing some white pants with a curtain wrapped around your waist.

524
00:36:11,918 --> 00:36:18,500
Scott: Yeah That's something I learned in high school from when they were building the the set for the school play.

525
00:36:19,142 --> 00:36:19,382
Scott: Mr.

526
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:27,272
Scott: Farrell who was in charge of that would always if you screwed up, he'd always say you can't see it from your house Because at a play no one's up close.

527
00:36:27,292 --> 00:36:28,780
Scott: They can't see stuff from far away.

528
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,035
Scott: So if you as long as you put it together well enough the small details don't really matter.

529
00:36:35,095 --> 00:36:36,699
Scott: people aren't coming up to inspect it.

530
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:38,368
Rym: Yeah, except people.

531
00:36:38,388 --> 00:36:40,139
Rym: the problem was I couldn't walk.

532
00:36:40,842 --> 00:36:47,885
Rym: Yeah, cuz it was tight and I can't walk in a tight dress in that little shuffling kind of gate I would have just fallen over.

533
00:36:47,925 --> 00:36:50,859
Rym: so I kind of stood still at the front of the room announcing people.

534
00:36:51,662 --> 00:36:59,559
Rym: awesome, of course, I remember also that Lisa and Kat were dressed up and Incredibly not terrible costumes.

535
00:37:00,642 --> 00:37:03,274
Scott: Yeah, some people actually spent time on their cows.

536
00:37:03,294 --> 00:37:04,559
Rym: You mean everyone but us.

537
00:37:05,072 --> 00:37:07,728
Scott: Yeah They had awesome costumes and we didn't know.

538
00:37:07,748 --> 00:37:14,791
Rym: the club after seeing this costume and remembering my previous year's costume Realized that I was a cheapskate and rims.

539
00:37:14,871 --> 00:37:17,400
Rym: terrible costume became a tradition in the club.

540
00:37:17,962 --> 00:37:18,344
Scott: Awesome.

541
00:37:18,605 --> 00:37:27,940
Rym: So the third year comes around and now I'm the president of the club I'm the top dog and the club is talking about what they think I'm gonna wear and how little money they think I'm gonna spend.

542
00:37:29,023 --> 00:37:33,342
Rym: So we decided to do Final Fantasy 8 Mmm.

543
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:40,074
Scott: Final Fantasy 8 great Just what we need more Final Fantasy costumes and giant swords.

544
00:37:40,094 --> 00:37:41,640
Scott: Isn't that the one with the sword with the gun in it?

545
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,638
Rym: Yes, the one with the sword in the gun.

546
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:47,060
Scott: Grumble grumble grumble.

547
00:37:47,542 --> 00:37:48,506
Rym: So we all pick things.

548
00:37:48,547 --> 00:37:57,804
Rym: that turned out that I happen to own a hat that looked exactly Like the hat that Irvine wore in the game and I had a brown trench coat, of course You never played the game.

549
00:37:57,824 --> 00:37:59,129
Scott: So you didn't know who Irvine was.

550
00:37:59,229 --> 00:38:01,920
Scott: someone else had printed out a picture of all the characters.

551
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,572
Rym: Yeah, and I saw this character who looked pretty much exactly like me.

552
00:38:05,592 --> 00:38:20,252
Rym: and because many people don't remember this Well, actually many people don't know this because they didn't know me in college but up until my senior year I had Australian Cowboy hat out of leather that I wore a lot.

553
00:38:20,693 --> 00:38:22,418
Scott: There's a funny story about that hat.

554
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:23,040
Scott: freshman year.

555
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:25,873
Rym: That's gonna have to be a geek fable for some day in the future.

556
00:38:26,074 --> 00:38:27,300
Scott: I think you just tell it right now.

557
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:36,500
Rym: It's pretty short now because we've gone on long enough and that story can be told at length if need be Alright, plus I have other stories about that hat and how the Hat finally died.

558
00:38:36,921 --> 00:38:42,580
Rym: But I didn't actually get to wear the Hat with this costume because for various reasons the Hat no longer fit on my head.

559
00:38:42,942 --> 00:38:46,820
Rym: In fact, I didn't realize until I tried to put it on right before Club, haha.

560
00:38:47,482 --> 00:38:58,540
Rym: So I had spent about two dollars on the previous year's costume and this year I didn't have much money at all as in I had like eight bucks left and a repossessed car.

561
00:38:58,821 --> 00:39:00,405
Rym: Yeah, my car was repossessed.

562
00:39:00,887 --> 00:39:03,936
Rym: I got it back a week later, but that should be a geek fable also.

563
00:39:03,956 --> 00:39:04,999
Rym: Yes, it should be.

564
00:39:05,865 --> 00:39:07,297
Rym: That was actually pretty hilarious.

565
00:39:07,539 --> 00:39:16,099
Rym: So The way I made this costume is I first off I put on some blue jeans and then I made Chaps out of felt and glued them to my blue jeans.

566
00:39:17,005 --> 00:39:18,113
Rym: Then I put on my trench coat.

567
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:19,040
Rym: Well, I had my trench coat.

568
00:39:19,642 --> 00:39:29,428
Rym: I took some fake fur and I kind of taped it around my neck kind of like his trench coat was Wow, and then the the kicker.

569
00:39:29,849 --> 00:39:34,400
Rym: he wore this kind of blue shirt underneath kind of like von von Allen escoflone.

570
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:44,313
Rym: I made the front half of a shirt out of felt complete with all the little leather things on it and I duct-taped it To my chest and put the trench coat on over it.

571
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:49,860
Scott: Oh, yeah Wait directly to your chest with your hair directly to my back where there's no hair.

572
00:39:50,962 --> 00:39:52,028
Rym: The shirt was on my chest.

573
00:39:52,068 --> 00:39:54,379
Rym: the duct tape went around my back and held it in place.

574
00:39:55,841 --> 00:39:59,880
Rym: Okay, and again from about 40 feet away the costume looked okay.

575
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:06,616
Rym: Yeah, if you got up to me, it looked pretty piss poor Especially when I revealed to the club that I was only wearing 50% of a shirt.

576
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,078
Scott: Wow, I really I don't remember that so much.

577
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:17,880
Rym: But yeah, well you weren't there in club space afterward when stories that I'm not gonna tell happened, but it was fun.

578
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,949
Scott: Well, why wasn't I there?

579
00:40:18,969 --> 00:40:19,675
Rym: I don't know.

580
00:40:20,681 --> 00:40:28,924
Rym: Well part of it was you weren't allowed in club space when you when nothing was going on because you quit the you quit the EA ship.

581
00:40:29,185 --> 00:40:31,655
Scott: Yeah, but I was still hanging out there sometimes.

582
00:40:31,715 --> 00:40:32,819
Scott: I wonder what was going on.

583
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:34,419
Rym: I don't think we allowed you up there anymore.

584
00:40:34,703 --> 00:40:35,088
Scott: I don't know.

585
00:40:35,129 --> 00:40:35,758
Rym: you didn't get to see.

586
00:40:36,482 --> 00:40:45,216
Rym: It was pretty there only like four of us up there at the time when I finally took the thing off and I think everyone In club, however heard the screams of agony as I ripped the duct tape off of my back.

587
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:49,597
Rym: Ah Yeah, I'm not good at dressing up.

588
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,926
Rym: Yeah, actually I'm pretty good.

589
00:40:51,966 --> 00:40:53,171
Rym: now the matter is just money.

590
00:40:53,212 --> 00:40:54,939
Rym: now that I have money I can make awesome costumes.

591
00:40:55,322 --> 00:40:57,698
Scott: Yeah, I can too, but I need time which I don't have.

592
00:40:58,941 --> 00:41:01,186
Scott: Let's see any other funny Halloween stories.

593
00:41:01,227 --> 00:41:03,332
Scott: we got geek fables of Halloween.

594
00:41:04,294 --> 00:41:05,798
Scott: I can't really think of any right now.

595
00:41:06,821 --> 00:41:12,620
Rym: We've got funny stories, but they're all more related to anime or gaming than they are to actually Halloween.

596
00:41:13,042 --> 00:41:14,106
Scott: I remember one Halloween.

597
00:41:14,126 --> 00:41:18,223

00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:21,656

00:41:21,676 --> 00:41:22,780
Rym: We're gonna be carving pumpkins.

600
00:41:23,101 --> 00:41:25,335
Scott: Yep, we haven't had a pumpkin to carve in years.

601
00:41:25,396 --> 00:41:26,020
Rym: Yeah, me either.

602
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,580

603
00:41:28,981 --> 00:41:30,607
Rym: Yeah, if only we had someone to help us make that.

604
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:39,160
Scott: I mean our friend Yuko made some badass pumpkins back in the day And well because she's an artist so she just draws something awesome on the pumpkin and then carves it out.

605
00:41:39,341 --> 00:41:41,317
Rym: And I know Emily can make a badass pumpkin.

606
00:41:41,397 --> 00:41:41,720
Rym: You know what?

607
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,980
Rym: I'll imagine just about everyone else we know can make a badass pumpkin.

608
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:48,495
Scott: I might go get the internet to help me making badass pumpkin.

609
00:41:48,515 --> 00:41:49,640
Rym: I imagine that's going to fail.

610
