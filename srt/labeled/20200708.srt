00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,213
Rym: It's Wednesday July 8th 2020.

2
00:00:11,213 --> 00:00:11,614
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,136 --> 00:00:14,362
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,382 --> 00:00:17,935
Rym: We're talking about that studio trigger Netflix anime BNA.

5
00:00:20,192 --> 00:00:21,243
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:21,263 --> 00:00:31,579
Rym: I Gotta say though, uh, we're watching Kipo kind of at the same time like that that Like kids show about the post apocalypse.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,127
Rym: I've talked about a gig nights before in Kipo.

8
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:56,329
Rym: There's like Multiple points where different characters end up in a situation where they have one big beefy arm but like nothing else is weird about them like a normal looking character with one gigantic trogdor arm that happens like enough to where it's a thing in that show and then we watch some BNA and One big beefy arm happens in BNA multiple times as well

9
00:00:57,317 --> 00:00:58,186
Scott: Happened so many times.

10
00:00:58,226 --> 00:01:04,730
Rym: Yep And in the mini recent season of Rick and Morty one beefy arm is actually the like B plot of an entire episode.

11
00:01:06,054 --> 00:01:10,097
Rym: I feel like if your thing is one big beefy arm 2019 to 2020 might be your time.

12
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:17,064
Scott: What other instances can I think of of the the one beefy arm?

13
00:01:17,124 --> 00:01:19,170
Rym: I guess though is my dog like trogdor?

14
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:20,705
Scott: Yeah, truck door.

15
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:38,329
Scott: so far I've got trogdor like three different characters in Kipo bunch of characters in BNA and character in on x-factor in the 90s who is like whose mutant power was just like being like super muscle for like beyond any point of.

16
00:01:39,452 --> 00:01:41,067
Rym: That made sense, but only in one arm.

17
00:01:41,912 --> 00:01:45,964
Scott: No, I think it was pretty much like his whole upper body a tiny legs, but that's just.

18
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:47,830
Rym: it was like it was like bad.

19
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,937
Scott: It was too little tiny.

20
00:01:49,158 --> 00:01:50,044
Scott: What was that guy's name?

21
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:50,346
Scott: Let's see.

22
00:01:50,446 --> 00:01:50,990
Scott: I'll look it up.

23
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,387
Rym: Well, it feels like a documentary of just people who skip leg day.

24
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:55,739
Rym: So I do have an opening bit.

25
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:03,746
Rym: Oh, his name was literally strong guy Really running out of ideas there for your superheroes.

26
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:04,350
Rym: Strong guy?

27
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,197
Scott: His first appearance was in New Mutants in 1985.

28
00:02:07,197 --> 00:02:11,370
Rym: Okay, actually strong guy just feels like Venture Brothers with a brick frog.

29
00:02:13,492 --> 00:02:21,270
Rym: So I uh the other day I Ate a food that I have not eaten in more than a decade.

30
00:02:21,653 --> 00:02:23,690
Rym: I cannot remember the last time I ate this food.

31
00:02:24,152 --> 00:02:29,916
Rym: I believe it was while we were at RIT still but okay I got a package of a bunch.

32
00:02:29,956 --> 00:02:30,237
Rym: was it?

33
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:30,999

Scott: was it the the the Barrens frozen pizza?

35
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:36,650
Rym: Oh, no No, no, it is not that it was in fact Cheetos.

36
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:38,540
Scott: Yeah, I don't eat that.

37
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:39,450
Rym: Yeah, I don't eat that either.

38
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:48,507
Rym: So when I was a kid though when I was a young kid like high school middle school I would eat like an entire family-sized bag of Cheetos by myself like watching TV.

39
00:02:49,529 --> 00:02:50,889
Scott: I love Cheetos.

40
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:55,490
Rym: Okay, so obviously I do not particularly care for Cheetos anymore.

41
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:56,649
Rym: I have not eaten them in a long time.

42
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:04,730
Rym: But for because we can't like stop to eat out Especially previously in the earlier parts of COVID we had to bring like a lot of food and snacks with us.

43
00:03:05,032 --> 00:03:13,290
Rym: So I bought a like Frito-Lay Box that just had a whole bunch of different like mini packages of various like Frito-Lay things.

44
00:03:13,431 --> 00:03:14,094
Rym: It's a lot of like.

45
00:03:14,154 --> 00:03:17,230
Scott: I bought a box of fig bars and also some stinger waffles.

46
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,016
Rym: I got those two stinger waffles.

47
00:03:19,076 --> 00:03:21,465
Rym: That is the best-kept secret of bikers and runners.

48
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:23,070
Rym: Stinger waffle will keep you going.

49
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:28,839
Scott: I love those things But I'm glad I discovered them for free.

50
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,750
Rym: Yeah, I discovered them on the Harlem Valley rail ride.

51
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,533
Rym: I never had one before.

52
00:03:32,553 --> 00:03:35,927
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I I think I had one on one ride before that.

53
00:03:36,108 --> 00:03:41,755
Rym: On that ride I remember I stopped and I was looking at the snack thing at the first rest stop and I saw that stinger waffle and I Was like honey waffle.

54
00:03:42,057 --> 00:03:43,825
Rym: that sounds like it's up my alley and I ate it.

55
00:03:44,126 --> 00:03:46,870
Rym: and then the next rest stop I grabbed like three and stuck them in my pocket.

56
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,290
Rym: Yeah, so but we got the snack pack and it's mostly like the stuff I wanted.

57
00:03:52,772 --> 00:03:56,090
Rym: But there's four little bags of Cheetos in there.

58
00:03:56,592 --> 00:03:57,876
Rym: I'm not just gonna throw them away.

59
00:03:57,896 --> 00:04:01,528
Rym: and I was desperately hungry like right after a run the other day.

60
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:06,328
Rym: So I opened a bag of Cheetos and I ate a food that I have not eaten in over a decade.

61
00:04:06,348 --> 00:04:07,617
Rym: and all I got To say about Cheetos.

62
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:09,109
Rym: They are not good.

63
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,814
Rym: They are not great Like time-traveling.

64
00:04:12,874 --> 00:04:18,269
Rym: Rym has to return to the year 1994 and smack that shit out of young rims hands.

65
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:18,630
Scott: good.

66
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:23,492
Scott: Well, first of all, we know that as you get older your taste buds change and I think that Effects.

67
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:28,790
Rym: maybe my taste bud my adult taste buds just can't handle the extreme power of Cheetos, right?

68
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:29,494
Scott: It's like I'll make.

69
00:04:29,856 --> 00:04:32,010

Scott: who are you onion?

72
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:38,234

Rym: Like I'll eat onion raw like while I'm cooking I'll just like I'll bite into an apple.

78
00:04:49,758 --> 00:04:51,910
Scott: Yeah, bite into an apple like an onion like a apple.

79

Scott: I'll do that, too.

81
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:03,504
Rym: but Cheetos That is a sad food to have in your body because it tastes fake.

82
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:08,729
Rym: and then when I actually finished eating the Cheetos It felt like I just had like star foam peanuts in my stomach.

83
00:05:10,094 --> 00:05:11,723
Rym: It was just a bad experience all around.

84
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:18,869
Rym: I give cheetah Adult Rym gives Cheetos two stars because one star is reserved for that big boy on the New York State Thruway.

85

Scott: All right.

94
00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:42,941
Scott: So a comic that has been gone since.

95
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,647
Scott: when did it go away?

96
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:45,008

100
00:05:50,438 --> 00:05:51,383
Rym: Oh, we are family.

101
00:05:51,403 --> 00:05:52,530
Rym: We were obsessed with the far side.

102
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,530
Rym: We bought every like compilation book as they came out like we had them all in the library.

103
00:05:57,012 --> 00:06:01,870
Scott: So when I was a kid 80s 90s, right newspaper comic strip was a thing.

104
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:04,939
Scott: it's still kind of a thing, but it you you know, it.

105
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:14,850
Scott: basically it dwindled as I was reading them right as Comics became available in other mediums, especially the webcomic and people start reading the newspaper.

106
00:06:14,912 --> 00:06:17,377
Scott: Yeah pretty much killed this newspaper comic.

107
00:06:17,437 --> 00:06:30,776
Rym: at the same time a lot of good which is ever comics either change like Their process or got worse or like the selection started changing before even before newspaper comic as a whole was dying And newspapers were still a thing.

108
00:06:31,298 --> 00:06:33,424
Scott: They were constantly being you know shrunken.

109
00:06:33,444 --> 00:06:35,630
Scott: right, you know, you look at like early.

110
00:06:35,932 --> 00:06:36,537
Scott: I got over there.

111
00:06:36,578 --> 00:06:40,095
Scott: I got a collection of all these early Frickin Prince Valiance.

112
00:06:40,537 --> 00:06:43,084
Scott: each one of them is a full newspaper page.

113
00:06:43,104 --> 00:06:44,387
Scott: They're enormous, right?

114
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:45,410
Scott: The books are enormous.

115
00:06:45,511 --> 00:06:46,740
Scott: I'll bring one over.

116
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,129
Rym: if there wasn't audio podcast I got him all over in the bedroom right now.

117
00:06:50,432 --> 00:07:01,288
Rym: But as a kid, right the far side Was amazing because I didn't have modern internet and the far side was like the weird Absurdist humor that it turns out is my favorite kind of humor as an adult.

118
00:07:01,308 --> 00:07:04,570
Scott: Yep There was not the other cotton, you know.

119
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:10,470
Scott: You would read the newspaper comics and a lot of them were pretty much just like Hallmark card fodder.

120
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:16,130
Scott: Yeah, you know and you know some of them had something special going on with them.

121
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:23,110
Scott: Right and those ones are always obvious and stood out and the far side was one of those like far side Calvin and Hobbes.

122
00:07:23,492 --> 00:07:25,240
Rym: Foxtrot like there was like the sub.

123
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,170
Scott: soxtrot was still sort of Hallmark II.

124
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:32,404
Rym: Foxtrot was The best of the Hallmark II was like I was.

125
00:07:32,444 --> 00:07:33,470
Scott: it was nerdy Hallmark.

126
00:07:33,731 --> 00:07:38,184
Rym: It wasn't really anything creeped in a little bit because I remembered is always like.

127
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:41,374
Rym: the fact that there was nerdy stuff in that Comic made me read it.

128
00:07:41,615 --> 00:07:46,834
Rym: So I don't really begrudge nerds who get really into something because it speaks to them that way Hmm.

129
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:57,830
Scott: Hey, but anyway So, yeah, so since 1995 Gary Larson unlike, you know the creator of Calvin Hobbes Who's been hiding somewhere in Ohio in the woods?

136
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,250
Rym: Did you read the thing where you talked about like how he reads like?

137

140
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,270

141
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,095
Rym: It was very recent.

142
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:49,580

Rym: and then he was like, I saw I got a tablet.

144
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,604

00:09:17,505 --> 00:09:20,515
Scott: ish right single panel Absurdist kind of things.

156
00:09:21,237 --> 00:09:24,066
Scott: you can see the joke in them, but they're not.

157
00:09:24,427 --> 00:09:26,034
Scott: laugh out loud funny They're not.

158
00:09:26,396 --> 00:09:29,071
Scott: if you put them in with the existing far side It's it.

159
00:09:29,513 --> 00:09:30,799
Scott: they would not rank highly.

160
00:09:30,859 --> 00:09:31,944
Scott: I don't think they would.

161
00:09:31,964 --> 00:09:35,590
Rym: they would fit in though They're about that level because I've always liked the far side.

162
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:42,770
Rym: But the far side was basically superseded by the dada esque nightmare escape of comedy that has arisen since on the internet.

163
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,216
Scott: Exactly, right.

164
00:09:44,276 --> 00:09:59,327
Scott: So and I say nightmare escape with love You know, so it's like we have all these amazing, you know, it's great that comics are no longer being, you know held back by You know publishers and newspapers deciding what gets you know out there and what doesn't.

165
00:09:59,408 --> 00:10:01,852
Scott: that's amazing You know.

166
00:10:01,973 --> 00:10:07,330
Scott: and it's it's great that all the you know, the small time webcomic people have a platform because I love all their shit.

167
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:12,189
Scott: You know, we have things like webtoon which seems to publish anything that anyone asked them to.

168
00:10:13,832 --> 00:10:15,720
Scott: You know and anyone can make a website and throw it.

169
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,990
Scott: or do you just put their comic on Twitter?

170
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,030
Scott: You don't even need a website.

171
00:10:19,931 --> 00:10:24,545
Scott: But you know, it's also great to have you know old people come back to right?

172
00:10:24,605 --> 00:10:25,388
Scott: It's like let's have.

173
00:10:25,408 --> 00:10:27,529
Scott: you know You know, there's room for everything.

174
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:33,250
Scott: So, you know having the whole space dominated by the awesome young people is great.

175
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:35,844
Scott: But you know, we'll have room for one old guy.

176
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:43,313
Rym: one old guy is the one I'm always excited when someone like rediscovers their art that they'd sort of semi-retired from for reasons Right.

177
00:10:43,353 --> 00:10:55,656
Scott: It's also, you know, I think at one point, you know New York likes to put these different like signs up in the in the city that are just like not necessarily advertisements just sort of like inspirational posters.

178
00:10:55,696 --> 00:11:00,313
Scott: occasionally you'll see I remember ones ones that were like Beethoven.

179
00:11:00,353 --> 00:11:03,308
Scott: he didn't compose shit till he was like 80 or something, right?

180
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,374
Scott: And it's like.

181
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:06,089
Scott: I don't know how true that is.

182
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:11,308
Rym: But well, I think a lot of the kind of Monte Cristo was in his 40s before he can do his stride, right?

183
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:12,994
Scott: It was something like that.

184
00:11:13,074 --> 00:11:16,305
Scott: So it's sort of like, you know, Gary Larson holds that dude.

185
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:17,630
Scott: He's got to be way old, right?

186
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,237
Rym: It's I actually don't know.

187
00:11:19,298 --> 00:11:19,519
Rym: I don't.

188
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:24,952
Rym: I've never said I don't even know what he looks like, but I've read nice Nice.

189
00:11:25,153 --> 00:11:32,843
Scott: Yeah, so if 69 year old Gary Larson can make his first webcomic And you are less than 69, right?

190
00:11:33,204 --> 00:11:34,168
Scott: You got a long way to go.

191
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:37,785
Scott: Don't worry about starting late in life, right?

192
00:11:38,128 --> 00:11:40,538
Rym: Yep So, uh some other news.

193
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:49,935
Rym: we I enjoy slayers like the anime I've seen I think every slayers OAV and I've only seen the TV show up through try and Scott's only seemed up through.

194
00:11:49,995 --> 00:11:51,862
Rym: next like we you mean Emily we're gonna watch.

195
00:11:51,922 --> 00:11:54,230
Rym: try and we got distracted never really like did it?

196
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,024
Scott: I have the TV also watched two episodes of some other slayer.

197
00:11:57,084 --> 00:12:03,426
Rym: Oh, we watched the revolution Yeah, where the where the weird thing shows up and can also cast dragon slave and then we didn't.

198
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:07,246
Rym: yeah watch it further I think because it was hard to get episodes like there was something up with it.

199
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:08,750
Rym: This was a long time No, is it available?

200
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,032
Rym: Probably but you should watch.

201
00:12:10,052 --> 00:12:13,445
Rym: try first like stay in order to rewatch the regular sleep.

202
00:12:13,485 --> 00:12:17,296
Scott: I can rewatch regular slayers As it is a random side note, right?

203
00:12:17,376 --> 00:12:22,490
Scott: So, you know occasionally I've been watching the the link to the past randomizer, right?

204
00:12:23,071 --> 00:12:33,809
Scott: so one of the top players of the link to the past randomizer is somebody whose internet name is Zalgadus son, right?

205
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:39,110
Scott: So so and it's he doesn't put a space or a hyphen in it or anything.

206
00:12:39,171 --> 00:12:40,669
Scott: It's just like Zalgadus on right?

207
00:12:40,991 --> 00:12:48,286
Scott: So I'm like that person's a slayers fan and I went to their stream and asked them and yeah There's a big time slayer someone who is like noting the honorific.

208
00:12:48,307 --> 00:12:48,970
Rym: That's like someone's like.

209
00:12:50,793 --> 00:12:50,973
Rym: So.

210
00:12:51,054 --> 00:12:59,343
Scott: the one I want to make though is it's hilarious that whatever Zalgadus on is racing and there's like commentators on like a restream.

211
00:12:59,544 --> 00:13:01,269
Rym: There's like always on like they don't get.

212
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,845
Scott: oh They'll just be like Zalga or Zalga Disson or my god, right?

213
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:06,547
Scott: They think they see.

214
00:13:06,587 --> 00:13:07,450
Scott: it is all one word.

215
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,252
Scott: They don't know.

216
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:11,102
Scott: so I went to the Zalga's channel to confirm.

217
00:13:11,202 --> 00:13:14,797
Scott: and indeed huge slayers fan, you know That's one thing.

218
00:13:14,937 --> 00:13:15,923
Scott: and also chill dude.

219
00:13:16,024 --> 00:13:20,621
Rym: as far as I can tell Esports commentators are starting to do correctly now.

220
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:24,193
Rym: I've noticed similar to our real sports like I don't want to say real sports But you know what?

221
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:26,230
Rym: I mean like an NHL commentator.

222
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:27,694
Rym: They have like.

223
00:13:28,055 --> 00:13:31,730
Rym: there is an official cheat sheet you have if you're a commentator in a professional sport.

224
00:13:32,152 --> 00:13:34,103
Rym: That is like any name you might have to say.

225
00:13:34,123 --> 00:13:37,744
Rym: here is the phonetic Like how to say it in case you have to say it on air.

226
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:38,670
Rym: so it's consistent.

227
00:13:38,771 --> 00:13:44,190
Rym: So they don't mess that up that often Esports are doing the same thing with the handles of these characters for obvious reasons.

228
00:13:44,812 --> 00:13:47,403
Rym: I feel like the streaming commentary people.

229
00:13:47,925 --> 00:13:49,290
Rym: that is a very easy thing.

230
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,850
Rym: They could do when they're commenting on streams is ask someone how to pronounce their screen name in advance.

231
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:57,766
Rym: Otherwise you're gonna get rhyme and a pretch a doing their podcast.

232
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,523
Scott: I Mean my my name intentionally doesn't have a correct pronunciation.

233
00:14:02,684 --> 00:14:05,455
Rym: Yeah, I do know that There are.

234
00:14:05,676 --> 00:14:06,018
Scott: there are.

235
00:14:06,058 --> 00:14:14,634
Scott: you could make various arguments for different ones But I will not officially deem any one of them all wrong and all right Simultaneous in a distant future.

236
00:14:14,675 --> 00:14:16,559
Rym: the Wikipedia article has a section.

237
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,670
Rym: It's unclear whether or not there was a canonical pronunciation of Scott Scott's ground.

238
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,549
Scott: There's a whole section pronouncing Scott's pronouncing Scott's stage name.

239
00:14:26,494 --> 00:14:30,556
Rym: However the fuck you want The question will be in our old age.

240
00:14:30,676 --> 00:14:35,750
Rym: is that section by itself or is that section in a controversy section about us?

241
00:14:38,352 --> 00:14:47,186
Rym: But I'm pretty pumped to read these novels because I've read Segments from them that fans had translated in the past and from what everyone who has read them in Japanese has said.

242
00:14:47,548 --> 00:14:50,982
Rym: the slayers TV show Is super fun and but it's also like it's.

243
00:14:51,263 --> 00:14:55,910
Rym: it's kind of a shonen fighting show That's just hidden like it's buried in many layers.

244
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:56,855
Rym: It has a lot more.

245
00:14:57,177 --> 00:14:59,429
Scott: it has a lot more comedy going on than other.

246
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:04,350
Rym: Yes, but it also gets like serious and a weird like we've reviewed slayers in the past.

247
00:15:04,952 --> 00:15:10,110
Rym: Everyone says that the novels are just faster and denser versions of that.

248
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,400
Rym: It's just pop up up go go go like joke a minute.

249
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:16,390
Rym: Just everyone loves these novels from what I can visual.

250
00:15:16,571 --> 00:15:16,973
Scott: You know those.

251
00:15:16,994 --> 00:15:19,590
Scott: I don't know if they're visual novels or not, but yeah, they're light novels.

252
00:15:20,372 --> 00:15:24,502
Scott: Okay, yeah light novels are short yep and fast.

253
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:28,452
Rym: so so they're all getting published in English by J Novel Club.

254
00:15:28,913 --> 00:15:31,522
Rym: that was just announced like a little while ago.

255
00:15:31,823 --> 00:15:33,347
Rym: the release is coming in next year.

256
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:41,865
Rym: in July So July 2021 we can read the first omnibus volume of the slayers novels And they're gonna come out at a pretty good clip after that.

257
00:15:43,032 --> 00:15:51,430
Rym: Cool in some other brief news as you know where there won't be really any conventions this year that are in person But there's gonna be a bunch of conventions online.

258
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:58,219
Rym: It is highly likely we'll be doing a panel or two at the crunchyroll Expo Which is coming up in early September.

259
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:00,710
Rym: so keep an eye out for that.

260
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:07,094
Rym: I don't think that like they haven't published a lot of details about exactly what's gonna happen at the convention yet But the websites up.

261
00:16:07,475 --> 00:16:12,696
Rym: like if you're a nerd who thinks you have a panel to submit like they have all those normal channels There's a very good chance.

262
00:16:12,776 --> 00:16:17,099
Rym: We will be presenting there as well as that packs online I think we talked about in the last show.

263
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:23,050
Rym: if you are the kind of person Who thinks you can do the kind of things we do like you have something to say about anime or something to say.

264
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,963
Scott: All you gotta do is is push a record button on whatever camera you got.

265
00:16:27,003 --> 00:16:33,668
Scott: your phone is good enough your webcams good enough And then talk about a nerdy thing that you are an expert on.

266
00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:36,243
Scott: if you're a nerd You just got to be something you know a lot about.

267
00:16:36,264 --> 00:16:49,170
Rym: so maybe you watch Maybe you read the entirety of Cromartie, and you figured out some like massive Reading of Cromartie the manga that no one is expressed before and you want to talk about the allegory and nuance of that manga.

268
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:53,000
Scott: Or maybe you're even just a such a mainstream nerd right.

269
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,730
Scott: It's like you watch Star Wars, and you play some triple-a video game.

270
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,470
Scott: It's like well you play the triple-a video game a whole bunch you better.

271
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:04,307
Scott: You should probably know a lot about it right which means you should be able to talk about it for like an hour.

272
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:06,595
Scott: boom Done you got your panel.

273
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:07,719
Rym: Yeah, here's an idea.

274
00:17:07,979 --> 00:17:10,327
Rym: say you're mainly not an anime fan like you.

275
00:17:10,347 --> 00:17:13,436
Rym: don't go to anime cons But you watch a lot of anime.

276
00:17:13,637 --> 00:17:19,037
Rym: like there are a lot of people who watch a lot of anime would never Self-identify as an anime fan.

277
00:17:19,156 --> 00:17:20,300
Rym: anime is just something they watch.

278
00:17:20,762 --> 00:17:33,360
Rym: I could see a panel being someone like that Just saying like talking about how that fan experience is because a lot of weebs and people like us who are really into the anime We have particular and peculiar tastes.

279
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:40,982
Rym: sometimes like anime fandom is not Really like what most people who watch anime are like in America.

280
00:17:41,322 --> 00:17:44,130
Rym: I could see that being a cool panel, but it's virtual.

281
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:44,734
Rym: It's online.

282
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:45,538
Rym: now's your chance.

283
00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:50,490
Rym: if you've always wanted to do a panel at a con But you couldn't fly out you get stage fright.

284
00:17:50,811 --> 00:17:51,955
Rym: You can make a million takes.

285
00:17:51,975 --> 00:17:53,841
Rym: you can edit your panel if you need to.

286
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:55,286
Rym: there's a lot of ways to go here.

287
00:17:55,306 --> 00:18:07,527
Rym: Oh, yeah Good times But anyway things of the day, so this is a pretty cool video.

288
00:18:07,547 --> 00:18:08,630
Rym: It's only about two minutes long.

289
00:18:09,432 --> 00:18:10,355
Rym: It's colorized.

290
00:18:10,736 --> 00:18:14,950
Rym: It wasn't filmed in color obviously, but it was colorized with some decent nuance.

291
00:18:15,432 --> 00:18:28,530
Rym: This is just some film footage like candid street film footage of Tokyo around 1913 through 1915. over a hundred years ago, and this is very similar.

292
00:18:28,611 --> 00:18:29,841
Rym: I had a thing of the day a long time ago.

293
00:18:29,882 --> 00:18:34,850
Rym: That was basically a similar thing for New York City from the same time period.

294
00:18:35,691 --> 00:19:00,503
Rym: This is really fascinating to watch because there is in many ways very little difference between how people react to a camera in Tokyo in 1913 and how people react to a camera on the streets of New York City in 1913 right down to a little kid like adults trying to like not look at the camera because they understand what's going on and kids Running over to the camera and jumping up and down and like making a ruckus.

295
00:19:01,085 --> 00:19:01,888
Rym: It's a pretty good video.

296
00:19:01,928 --> 00:19:12,762
Scott: It's pretty cool Alright, so we got so as someone who has owned the entirety of the Akira manga twice Might own it again.

297
00:19:12,822 --> 00:19:13,246
Scott: We'll see.

298
00:19:15,391 --> 00:19:21,430
Scott: Is watch the movie several times and all of its different mastered editions, right?

299
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:36,039
Scott: pretty much, you know everything short of Getting all the Japanese merchandise that was made when I was like, you know less than 10 years old Right, I was not aware of this video.

300
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:46,368
Scott: that who knows when this video was originally You know made available to the public but it's been online on YouTube since 2017 and I just didn't know about it.

301
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:49,973
Scott: It's Right.

302
00:19:49,993 --> 00:19:52,464
Scott: Yeah, so but you know, it only has 2.3 K up votes.

303
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,857
Scott: I don't know why it has 12 down votes.

304
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:57,622
Scott: It only has 53,000 views.

305
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:04,803
Scott: The point is this is a video From the studio where they were making a Kara.

306
00:20:04,843 --> 00:20:06,490
Scott: you are watching in this video.

307
00:20:07,092 --> 00:20:09,379
Scott: They're painting the backgrounds for the movie.

308
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:10,582
Scott: They are drawing the cells.

309
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,050
Scott: They are photographing the cells, right?

310
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:16,810
Scott: There's a. there's a Japanese narrator, but it's been dubbed over in English.

311
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:20,608
Scott: So the Japanese narration a volume is very quiet and you can't really hear it.

312
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:30,041
Scott: Not that I could understand it anyway, but the English narrator is obviously Greatly simplifying what the the original narration was.

313
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:35,510
Rym: this feels very similar to the footage you get if you watch The reluctant dragon from Disney, right?

314
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,997
Scott: But it really doesn't matter what the narrator is saying.

315
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:38,178
Scott: it's.

316
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:41,909
Scott: you can see here what it looked like when they were making this movie.

317
00:20:43,352 --> 00:20:48,918
Scott: You know and if people don't know, you know about some of the production details Of Akira the movie right.

318
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:51,690
Scott: not only did it cost a fortune for the time, right?

319
00:20:52,934 --> 00:21:00,168
Scott: And it got delayed a whole bunch I think and it forced the manga to get delayed because Otomo is working on this instead and such and such.

320
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:06,250
Scott: but I had heard that it was animated on the ones for the entire movie, right?

321
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:10,670
Scott: Which means that they drew 24 pictures for every second of animation.

322
00:21:11,293 --> 00:21:18,950
Scott: But in this video it shows them right Photographing cells and when they push the advanced button right for the film.

323
00:21:19,331 --> 00:21:26,036
Scott: You can see the counter goes up by two right and animating on the twos is still Amazing, right?

324
00:21:26,217 --> 00:21:28,065
Scott: Usually things are animated like the threes.

325
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:33,549
Rym: or well Reddit thread where there's a long debate about whether or not it was on the ones or two.

326
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:37,230
Scott: Well, here's a video where clearly they advance that frame by two, right?

327
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,296
Scott: I think that's indisputable.

328
00:21:38,336 --> 00:21:40,550
Scott: The number goes up by two on the on the counter, right?

329
00:21:41,171 --> 00:21:41,589
Scott: regardless.

330
00:21:42,812 --> 00:21:50,703
Scott: It also talks about just the absurd number of different colors of paint that were used To make Akira and you can see here.

331
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:52,290
Scott: Everyone knows the backgrounds in Akira.

332
00:21:52,410 --> 00:22:17,425
Scott: We're always astonishing right especially the city the cityscapes and you can see here the dude with the gold paint and the paintbrush Putting dots right using a special tool to keep the dots in a straight line right to put the the windows on the faraway skyscrapers Right and it's like yeah, this is why no one does this anymore But you can at least there we eat now have we have video footage showing how it was done.

333
00:22:17,445 --> 00:22:18,809
Scott: It wasn't some trick.

334
00:22:21,411 --> 00:22:22,074
Scott: Go watch Akira.

335
00:22:22,095 --> 00:22:23,340
Scott: if you haven't seen it what's wrong with you?

336
00:22:23,682 --> 00:22:25,410
Rym: I can watch Akira again, it's been a while.

337
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,628
Scott: I can watch it again every day.

338
00:22:28,271 --> 00:22:28,996
Rym: Akira is definitely it's.

339
00:22:29,036 --> 00:22:30,123
Rym: it's on that list of movies.

340
00:22:30,143 --> 00:22:34,748
Rym: I Would just probably watch to the end if I started watching any part of it.

341
00:22:36,191 --> 00:22:38,695
Rym: Sure All right in the better moment.

342
00:22:38,795 --> 00:22:39,578
Rym: We're stuck at home.

343
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:40,462
Rym: We can't do a lot.

344
00:22:40,502 --> 00:22:41,627
Rym: We'll be at some online cons.

345
00:22:41,647 --> 00:22:45,675
Rym: like I said Follow our youtubes you'll see stuff We're working on.

346
00:22:46,078 --> 00:22:52,369
Rym: we're at some point gonna read the tale of Genji But we're not reading a lot right now because we don't have any travel where we would normally read.

347
00:22:54,935 --> 00:22:56,550
Scott: Yeah, read some slayers novels instead.

348
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:01,068
Rym: Why don't you starting in a year which we'll see if we're still in a quarantine by then considering the way the u.s.

349
00:23:01,108 --> 00:23:01,489
Rym: Is going?

350
00:23:02,288 --> 00:23:06,980
Rym: Oh I'm already looking at not going back to my office until early 2022.

351
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:16,150
Scott: So yeah, they said for me I will not be forced to go back to the office until mid-september and then after that is question mark, right?

352
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:16,912
Rym: Yeah, we have.

353
00:23:16,932 --> 00:23:17,795
Rym: we have an September.

354
00:23:17,836 --> 00:23:30,430
Scott: we have like an opt-in where people you can actually like Yeah, you I could if I wanted to have asked and gone back to my office like now ish But they posted a video of like the protocols for going back to the office.

355
00:23:30,933 --> 00:23:32,300
Rym: There's a whole onerous thing.

356
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,069
Rym: Like if you want to go back to the office now was like.

357
00:23:34,089 --> 00:23:34,711
Scott: no It's like.

358
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:35,715
Scott: it's like why bother?

359
00:23:35,755 --> 00:23:37,501
Scott: what's if no one else's in my coat?

360
00:23:37,581 --> 00:23:40,190
Scott: my team people on my team aren't all gonna be there.

361
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,093
Scott: Then what's the benefit?

362
00:23:41,154 --> 00:23:42,137
Scott: Why should I go through the hassle?

363
00:23:42,238 --> 00:23:49,530
Rym: Yeah, instead I'll be instead of being at a video call from my comfy house I'll be on a video call wearing a mask from an office with other people who are in their comfy houses.

364
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:51,518
Scott: Yeah, no point.

365
00:23:51,759 --> 00:24:04,110
Rym: Yeah, but I basically I told The people the powers that be that I'm unwilling to return to any office until I get a vaccine Mmm, so that that pushes my date out pretty far and we'll see how things go.

366
00:24:04,831 --> 00:24:07,160
Rym: but uh, yeah, we're making stuff as best we can.

383
00:25:06,696 --> 00:25:09,009
Scott: Yeah, a little witch academia, etc.

384
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:10,735
Scott: This one.

385
00:25:10,835 --> 00:25:16,790
Scott: you can still see a lot of the typical studio trigger Tropes in this show.

386
00:25:17,011 --> 00:25:23,230
Rym: Specific thing that the the gold or white star that appears over things during effect is like all over this thing.

387
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,017
Rym: That's like triggers signature at this point.

388
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:26,282
Scott: You can see a lot of there.

389
00:25:26,403 --> 00:25:27,246
Scott: There's there.

390
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:28,110
Scott: it's all over the show.

391
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,370
Rym: I mean inferno can tell you in BNA.

392
00:25:31,093 --> 00:25:34,430
Scott: Yeah, you could just tell that this is a studio trigger show by watching it.

393
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:38,182
Scott: But the extreme crazy power level right.

394
00:25:38,222 --> 00:25:40,810
Scott: the trigger ometer is lower, right?

395
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:41,914
Scott: I think I'm promare.

396
00:25:41,954 --> 00:25:44,703
Scott: The trigger ometer is like a full-on turn up to 11.

397
00:25:44,703 --> 00:25:46,830
Scott: Yeah, right and kill la kill.

398
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:50,864
Rym: It's at like 9 right like six and a half seven on the trigger scale.

399
00:25:50,904 --> 00:25:52,550
Scott: Yeah, right a little like academia.

400
00:25:52,731 --> 00:25:53,433
Scott: It's even lower.

401
00:25:53,513 --> 00:25:55,520
Scott: It's maybe like four or three, right?

402
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,804
Rym: But I guess what I hear.

403
00:25:56,884 --> 00:25:58,710
Scott: it's like five six ish area.

404
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,402
Rym: Like they say kill la kill was just fucking.

405
00:26:01,462 --> 00:26:02,748
Rym: let's go crazy crazy crazy.

406
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,455
Rym: What the fuck is going on.

407
00:26:04,495 --> 00:26:06,562
Rym: promare was that times a million?

408
00:26:06,582 --> 00:26:15,054
Rym: This is more like a Normal anime but like the kind of anime that I was really into when I was getting into anime like the kind of show that I just love.

409
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:22,529
Rym: but instead of just being Trigger to 11 the entire time it has it's like trigger at six or seven the entire time.

410
00:26:22,911 --> 00:26:28,270
Rym: But individual scenes or episodes will approach the ten trigger scale, right?

411
00:26:29,915 --> 00:26:43,990
Scott: Well, yeah, I think the baseball episode is the most studio trigger Because the baseball episode in certain climax moments of the plot that base the the baseball episode was Extremely a lot like in kill la kill with all the different sports teams, right?

412
00:26:44,670 --> 00:27:01,737
Scott: final the final sports team with like the like the kill II like the bat that explodes and throws shards and Right and and also the catcher on the baseball team the little tiny bear of the little tiny bear is basically Mako Vakanchoku from kill la kill.

413
00:27:01,757 --> 00:27:04,670
Rym: it's the same character living in the poor part of town.

414
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:12,250
Scott: I wouldn't yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same voice actor It's the same personality and that character shows up in the baseball episode and then recurs.

415
00:27:12,471 --> 00:27:13,662
Scott: Yeah throughout the rest of this.

416
00:27:13,682 --> 00:27:16,644
Rym: I got a question for you Which of the Bears was your favorite one?

417
00:27:16,685 --> 00:27:17,289
Rym: Was it that one?

418
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:21,590
Scott: Cuz I mean, I don't really remember the other ones they stood out in my mind.

419
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:29,476
Rym: There's one that makes this blank face the whole time and there's one who always has his tongue hanging out and it's a tie between Those two for my favorite bear.

420
00:27:29,877 --> 00:27:33,170
Scott: Yeah, the other ones aren't memorable because they don't have names and they don't recur.

421
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,136
Scott: It's only that one the tiny one.

422
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:39,990
Rym: I like the flamingos - they felt a lot like a mini boss in kill la kill.

423
00:27:40,331 --> 00:27:41,918
Scott: Yeah, they gave the flamingos more.

424
00:27:41,998 --> 00:27:46,361
Scott: I think more screen time and personality than the other Evil baseball team.

425
00:27:46,441 --> 00:27:49,354
Scott: Yeah in that episode Alright, so BNA.

426
00:27:49,394 --> 00:27:50,678
Scott: What the hell is this show about?

427
00:27:50,698 --> 00:27:52,082
Scott: Don't worry about oil anything.

428
00:27:52,102 --> 00:27:52,945
Rym: It's only 12 episodes.

429
00:27:52,985 --> 00:27:54,610
Rym: Just fucking watch it like right?

430
00:27:55,219 --> 00:27:57,837
Scott: It's about Furries, right and it's up.

431
00:27:57,938 --> 00:27:58,521
Scott: It's also.

432
00:27:58,541 --> 00:28:01,438
Rym: it's also about racism X-men.

433
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:03,973
Rym: Yeah and X-men There's a world.

434
00:28:04,194 --> 00:28:05,860
Scott: some people in the world are humans.

435
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,485
Scott: Some people are beast people.

436
00:28:07,545 --> 00:28:09,899
Scott: beast people are Furries.

437
00:28:10,001 --> 00:28:13,394
Rym: Yeah People it's like a man.

438
00:28:13,475 --> 00:28:16,084
Rym: Oh, they transform world like history books.

439
00:28:16,144 --> 00:28:17,650
Rym: Talk about beast men the whole time.

440
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:27,347
Scott: All right, they can transform between a human form and a beast form But they're inherently different like species of homo sapien, but there's still sentient people.

441
00:28:27,548 --> 00:28:28,390
Scott: They're just beast people.

442
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:28,812
Scott: Yeah, right.

443
00:28:28,952 --> 00:28:29,696
Scott: They're just not cute.

444
00:28:29,716 --> 00:28:32,950
Scott: They're just not homo sapiens and they're persecuted by society.

445
00:28:34,431 --> 00:28:40,690
Scott: And so at least in Japan the beast men have the option of going to this city.

446
00:28:40,771 --> 00:28:42,249
Scott: That's been around for 10 years only.

447
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:53,350
Scott: it's a new city where the beast men can escape and live nominally only with other beast men and Therefore be free to be beast men, but not persecuted within basically a ghetto.

448
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:55,637
Scott: Yes, exactly, right?

449
00:28:55,678 --> 00:28:57,570
Scott: It's like there's no internet there, right?

450
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:02,629
Rym: So it's like here you want others of the people who created the city like there's questionable things going on.

451
00:29:03,272 --> 00:29:04,899
Scott: It's a lot like genosha and x-men.

452
00:29:04,939 --> 00:29:07,310
Scott: It's like all you mutants go or you know, whatever.

453
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:18,458
Scott: It's like okay all you people who are different can go live in this other place and therefore you won't have to face You know direct persecution from people of you know Because you won't see humans.

454
00:29:18,498 --> 00:29:19,182
Scott: They're not there.

455
00:29:19,202 --> 00:29:25,706
Scott: There's no humans living there But your entire city is walled off, you know gets shitty supplies.

456
00:29:25,786 --> 00:29:32,850
Scott: people are living in poverty Right, you know, so you're still facing this sort of systemic persecution from the rest of the world, right?

457
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:38,148
Scott: There was there's a. there was talk about like bird beast people having trouble like migrating.

458
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:43,409
Scott: Yeah Sport now right exactly that sort of thing is going on.

459
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:50,735
Rym: And if the transfer bit like the characters the cool thing is what they sort of transform based on emotion and just whatever they're up To like.

460
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:58,970
Rym: they're usually human by default But they'll sort of turn into the animal depending on what they're up to and they'll turn into varying degrees of that animal.

461
00:29:59,693 --> 00:30:01,842
Scott: Yep, so what's going on in this?

462
00:30:02,123 --> 00:30:03,810
Scott: the plot the plot is pretty simple.

463
00:30:04,231 --> 00:30:09,109
Scott: There is a human girl who is the main character who became a beast person like she was.

464
00:30:09,872 --> 00:30:15,247
Rym: She was a straight normal human and she became a beast person and she doesn't know why and she's right.

465
00:30:15,287 --> 00:30:16,270
Scott: that is not normal.

466
00:30:17,011 --> 00:30:20,390
Scott: Everyone else is either born a beast person or born a person.

467
00:30:20,531 --> 00:30:26,198
Scott: She was born a person and became a beast person a very strange Powered beast person.

468
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:41,576
Scott: and so to escape the persecution She runs to the beast people city and when she arrives there She just you know, you slow as the viewer you discover it more quickly than the characters that Shit in the beast city.

469
00:30:41,596 --> 00:30:46,370
Scott: There's definitely crazy secret conspiracies going on where people people are up to new good.

470
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:48,256
Scott: There's a shady pharmaceutical company.

471
00:30:48,577 --> 00:30:50,002
Scott: That's probably doing bad shit.

472
00:30:50,063 --> 00:30:52,170
Scott: Yeah mayor looks like they're up to bad shit.

473
00:30:52,491 --> 00:30:53,314
Scott: She's a shady.

474
00:30:53,676 --> 00:30:56,647
Rym: She shows up with her goal of but there's like.

475
00:30:56,667 --> 00:30:58,783
Rym: there's a Very clear story here.

476
00:30:58,803 --> 00:31:10,830
Rym: if she shows up Looking to just be safe and look for a cure for being a beast man and slowly starts to come to like being a beast man And like start to integrate herself into the society.

477
00:31:11,671 --> 00:31:13,556
Scott: Yep, there's a shady mafia.

478
00:31:13,596 --> 00:31:14,538
Scott: that's up to no good.

479
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:17,105
Scott: Basically all these different factions of beast people.

480
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,850
Scott: There's a religion that's up to no good.

481
00:31:19,031 --> 00:31:19,452
Rym: Yeah, right.

482
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:24,050
Scott: They're all mysteriously up to no good and the humans are obviously way up to way.

483
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:27,490
Rym: No, but if I had to review the show like in terms of like I really like it.

484
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,235
Rym: This is an a anime hands down.

485
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:30,238
Scott: It's pretty good.

486
00:31:30,579 --> 00:31:31,301
Rym: It's not a plus.

487
00:31:31,341 --> 00:31:34,190
Rym: That's super rare, but it's definitely an a anime.

488
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,374
Rym: I'd put it in the a-class.

489
00:31:35,735 --> 00:31:40,230
Rym: but the things that make it good as one is animated so well, it looks beautiful.

490
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:46,663
Rym: It's very nice highly stylized but it makes a lot more sense than some parts of from air do like.

491
00:31:46,723 --> 00:31:50,829
Rym: it is still grounded in like a Choreography in a real world to a degree.

492
00:31:52,131 --> 00:32:00,329
Rym: It also makes uses color and shading like really effectively and to convey a bunch of interesting things and It moves quick.

493
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:12,878
Rym: It skips over the boring obvious misunderstanding plots and like things you think will take the whole show to get resolved are resolved like in the episode they're Introduced to move on to something else like things.

494
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:17,407
Scott: that is what I was surprised and pleased by that and that 12 episodes I thought it's like.

495
00:32:17,448 --> 00:32:25,597
Scott: well I guess I'm gonna have to wait for a season two to uncover all these mysteries of the shady biz with the pharmaceutical company and Religion and the Mafia and the all those things.

496
00:32:25,959 --> 00:32:26,300
Scott: it's like.

497
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,466
Scott: no they covered all those in season one.

498
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,153
Rym: like there's no like they're in The beginning.

499
00:32:30,173 --> 00:32:39,850
Rym: there's like oh, there's a mystery of the silver wolf And it's pretty obvious to the viewer that most likely the wolf guy is the silver wolf like they foreshadowed that heavily.

500
00:32:40,331 --> 00:32:55,335
Rym: But the episode where that gets resolved you'll learn what the silver wolf really is and in the same episode a whole bunch of characters Find this out or reveal that they knew the true story, and they all share that information, and then the show just moves on mm-hmm.

501
00:32:56,453 --> 00:32:59,393
Rym: that is I Very refreshed.

502
00:32:59,494 --> 00:33:02,843
Rym: anytime a show moves quick and skips misunderstanding plots.

503
00:33:02,903 --> 00:33:04,889
Rym: That's basically my least favorite plot on earth.

504
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:09,159
Scott: Yep Let's see what else is going on in this show.

505
00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:11,810
Scott: so oh that's another thing that they move on.

506
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,760
Scott: There's a mystery of the.

507
00:33:13,841 --> 00:33:25,330
Scott: the main character had a friend a human friend from also turned into a beast person who also turned into a beast person and That friend is not present like all you know about them.

508
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,834
Scott: Is it like they were kidnapped or whatever?

509
00:33:26,895 --> 00:33:32,170
Rym: and they show up like and it's a really interesting plot they that character.

510
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,877
Scott: Yeah, it's like the mystery of that.

511
00:33:33,917 --> 00:33:34,138
Scott: It's like.

512
00:33:34,239 --> 00:33:34,921
Scott: Oh is it is the.

513
00:33:35,002 --> 00:33:37,030
Scott: is the friend gonna show up like at the end or something?

514
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:37,331
Scott: It's like.

515
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:40,834
Scott: no they show up kind of early on right not super early but they show up.

516
00:33:41,035 --> 00:33:53,321
Rym: they show about it like around halfway through and That also progresses rapidly like that character and that character's arc really just keeps moving at a high pace mm-hmm.

517
00:33:54,832 --> 00:34:01,026
Scott: So you know another thing about this show is that much like a lot of other recent studio trigger anime.

518
00:34:01,246 --> 00:34:05,175
Scott: right it is Going down the gay road.

519
00:34:05,195 --> 00:34:14,404
Rym: Oh, yeah, it is very clear that our main character and her friend There's there was definitely a like romantic attraction there.

520
00:34:14,824 --> 00:34:15,367
Rym: that has.

521
00:34:15,648 --> 00:34:17,176
Rym: I mean I'm trying not to spoil anything.

522
00:34:17,196 --> 00:34:19,830
Scott: the shows only right much like I can kill a kill right.

523
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:23,841
Scott: It's like there was clearly something going on right in promare.

524
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,887
Scott: It was even more clear right.

525
00:34:26,288 --> 00:34:28,871
Scott: and in BNA, I don't know It's like.

526
00:34:28,891 --> 00:34:33,350
Scott: the only way they could make it more clear is to stop being cowards and make it explicit.

527
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:36,077
Scott: They always do that thing where it's like.

528
00:34:36,518 --> 00:34:38,404
Scott: yeah, everyone can tell that they're gay.

529
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:42,655
Scott: There's no hetero relationships going on Right you know you can tell.

530
00:34:42,675 --> 00:34:48,728
Scott: this person is only expressing feelings towards this same sex person same gendered person right.

531
00:34:49,951 --> 00:34:51,896
Scott: Yet, they don't kiss.

532
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:52,899
Scott: They don't hug.

533
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,984
Scott: They don't actually say they don't.

534
00:34:55,145 --> 00:34:57,110
Scott: you know make they don't do they don't fuck.

535
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:02,108
Scott: They don't do anything to make the gayness explicit right which is I think it's like.

536
00:35:02,148 --> 00:35:04,556
Scott: on the one hand It's like it's like yay.

537
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,507
Scott: It's a gay show right a gay furry show.

538
00:35:07,547 --> 00:35:08,330
Rym: That's like come on.

539
00:35:09,471 --> 00:35:11,981
Scott: But on the other hand it's like you cowards right.

540
00:35:12,282 --> 00:35:13,767
Scott: yeah, you're not doing it of course.

541
00:35:13,787 --> 00:35:21,730
Rym: at the same time There is an argument to be made that by not just had like you don't have to have a relationship in every show Mmm.

542
00:35:22,332 --> 00:35:29,997
Rym: That's true like there is the trope of shows like to just pair characters off and have relationships be like a Plot of the show alongside everything else.

543
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:30,860
Rym: so it is all.

544
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,044
Rym: it is a little refreshing.

545
00:35:32,064 --> 00:35:34,907
Rym: that is not a primary plot But that is there.

546
00:35:35,815 --> 00:35:42,407
Rym: Well if you want to hear more about that yeah Breakfast did a podcast about the the gay perspective on BNA.

547
00:35:42,949 --> 00:35:52,313
Scott: yes We have gay friends Made a cup make a gay podcast called gay breakfast And they did an episode of BNA before us, and I'm sure if you listen to that It'll.

548
00:35:52,455 --> 00:36:00,170
Scott: I haven't listened to their episode on it But I'm sure if you did it'll probably be the whole episode talking about pretty much what I just said among other things.

549
00:36:00,412 --> 00:36:07,101
Rym: Though as an aside because I mentioned Kipo I'm not gonna spoil any details, but something very refreshing about that show because it's a kid show.

550
00:36:08,164 --> 00:36:20,070
Rym: an arc starts in an episode where a female character Begins to profess that they like a male character like that typical arc and the male character is like yeah That's cool at all, but I'm gay.

551
00:36:20,331 --> 00:36:26,129
Rym: He just says it like outright and the female character is like oh cool, and then they stay friends like that's it.

552
00:36:27,431 --> 00:36:34,150
Rym: It's explicit it happens immediately the show just moves on and it was a very like refreshing moments for a kids show.

553
00:36:34,311 --> 00:36:40,483
Scott: That's on mainstream TV Yeah, but I do want to point out though the last note about the gayness.

554
00:36:40,563 --> 00:36:43,394
Scott: the gay factor right is that Kill la kill.

555
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,280
Scott: right was Yuri action.

556
00:36:45,421 --> 00:36:48,070
Scott: Yeah, and pro mayor was gay action.

557
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,683
Scott: Yeah, right, and now we got your reaction again.

558
00:36:50,723 --> 00:37:00,826
Rym: Whatever the next trigger show is And loving man here they come look for the M2m action coming back, but I guess the show like the show is a solid anime.

559
00:37:00,866 --> 00:37:07,094
Rym: like the plot is Complex enough to be interesting in the same way that a lot of the anime I like are interesting.

560
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:08,700
Rym: one thing I noticed in particular.

561
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,586
Rym: I've seen everything, but the last four episodes at this point I watched the whole thing.

562
00:37:12,728 --> 00:37:26,108
Rym: yeah I haven't seen the last four, but I'm I can see the trajectory of where this is going Especially once the history of the beast men and that clearly Byzantine story like Byzantine era story came from.

563
00:37:26,771 --> 00:37:33,110
Scott: Basically the the the tropes of other trigger things right are are in full force.

564
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,073
Scott: It's like all the at.

565
00:37:34,113 --> 00:37:39,670
Scott: the ending which you haven't seen is basically the same ending as other trigger things.

566
00:37:40,152 --> 00:37:43,543
Scott: You know it's like you know and also they are.

567
00:37:43,563 --> 00:37:45,430
Scott: they borrow heavily from other animes, right?

568
00:37:45,711 --> 00:37:57,610
Rym: It's a very macross ending yeah, but whenever the mayor is talking to ogami the wolf They feel so much like when aramaki is talking to the major.

569
00:37:58,372 --> 00:38:01,622
Rym: Yes, exactly like I am the person made the mayor has.

570
00:38:01,642 --> 00:38:03,167
Scott: the mayor has some badass scenes.

571
00:38:03,227 --> 00:38:11,442
Rym: Yeah, the mayor is Big aramaki energy Yep, and I also appreciate the power scales in the show.

572
00:38:11,462 --> 00:38:19,086
Rym: like when there are fights like you know when there's a character Who is supposed to be more powerful than everyone else this show handles that really well.

573
00:38:19,126 --> 00:38:19,848
Rym: the wolf guy is?

574
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:24,158
Rym: crazy powerful and Whenever that matters.

575
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:36,721
Rym: like there's a scene where like someone pulls a gun on him I think they spent one frame of animation on him disarming that person Like he moves so fast and is so powerful.

576
00:38:36,922 --> 00:38:45,260
Rym: and the fight scenes in this show when there are fights are Really really dynamic and fun But they're not as abstract as like a promer fight scene.

577
00:38:45,641 --> 00:38:49,505
Rym: like you could draw these fight scenes in a physical space And they would make sense.

578
00:38:50,951 --> 00:38:57,996
Rym: Most of them most of the parts that would be hard to draw or make sense are the shape-changing things that the tanuki does Specifically because she's a shapeshifter.

579
00:38:58,497 --> 00:39:05,658
Scott: Yeah, I think the the one thing is that You know most of the things that happen in this show.

580
00:39:05,678 --> 00:39:14,096
Scott: it doesn't have a lot of originality right like you know It kept me kept making references like ghost in the shell Macross other trigger shows.

581
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:19,130
Scott: right it feels like almost like a greatest hits of other good anime.

582
00:39:19,251 --> 00:39:21,763
Rym: It's a greatest of what I like about anime the most.

583
00:39:21,803 --> 00:39:22,708
Scott: Oh, yeah, it's it there.

584
00:39:22,788 --> 00:39:23,150
Scott: It's great.

585
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:24,253
Scott: I didn't say it's the worst hit.

586
00:39:24,273 --> 00:39:24,675
Scott: yeah, right.

587
00:39:24,755 --> 00:39:29,590
Scott: It's greatest hits of other animes sort of combined into one anime.

588
00:39:29,791 --> 00:39:33,530
Rym: Yeah, but yeah, I didn't say there was no like big surprise like it's well-crafted.

589
00:39:33,691 --> 00:39:34,212
Rym: But it's not.

590
00:39:34,493 --> 00:39:38,508
Rym: it does not have any moment like an Evangelion or a cowboy bebop has of.

591
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:41,885
Rym: well I didn't see that come in and now I got to think about it for a while.

592
00:39:42,609 --> 00:39:43,312
Scott: right I think it.

593
00:39:43,353 --> 00:39:44,016
Scott: you know it's like.

594
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:45,362
Scott: it's like it's not.

595
00:39:45,422 --> 00:39:47,090
Scott: it's not like oh my god the greatest show.

596
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:48,316
Scott: It's just like it's an anime.

597
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:50,064
Scott: It's a great anime.

598
00:39:50,185 --> 00:39:51,189
Scott: Yeah, but it's still.

599
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,699
Scott: Solidly it's on anime.

600
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,330
Scott: It's like we are making an anime here.

601
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:56,659
Scott: We're doing all the anime things.

602
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:57,525
Scott: if you're an anime fan.

603
00:39:57,545 --> 00:39:58,229
Scott: You're gonna like this.

604
00:39:58,591 --> 00:40:02,445
Scott: I think if you're not an anime fan this show might be a little a.

605
00:40:02,586 --> 00:40:10,807
Rym: the show is very anime In a good way, but yeah like I'd if I show this to some random person who's never really watched anime I think they might have a little trouble with how fast it moves.

606
00:40:10,827 --> 00:40:18,410
Scott: I Think also that you know the themes and tropes and patterns, and then you know story points and characters.

607
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:21,822
Scott: They think are gonna miss what I what I really know.

608
00:40:21,842 --> 00:40:23,086
Scott: you're uncomfortable with them.

609
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:33,329
Rym: There is a lot there's a large number of characters and They're all relatively complex and their dialogues and interactions also move quickly alongside the plot.

610
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:38,898
Rym: like Characters will not like resist the same conversation multiple times in a row.

611
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:47,087
Rym: a lot of recent anime have had this weird specific trope of Characters basically spend a long time trying to convince each other of things multiple times.

612
00:40:47,388 --> 00:40:49,674
Rym: this show Blows past that.

613
00:40:50,236 --> 00:40:56,139
Scott: no no no I do like how fast it moves because it doesn't move too fast But it moves fast enough like episode one.

614
00:40:56,179 --> 00:40:57,504
Rym: Why do I do it?

615
00:40:57,545 --> 00:40:58,830
Rym: How do I get cured episode three?

616
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,921
Rym: I'm on the baseball team.

617
00:40:59,961 --> 00:41:00,609
Rym: Let's go right.

618
00:41:01,111 --> 00:41:06,428
Scott: I do wish though it would have slowed down because there are some side characters right who?

619
00:41:08,431 --> 00:41:09,977
Scott: Do not get their time right.

620
00:41:09,998 --> 00:41:11,644
Scott: so there's like a flip flip daughter.

621
00:41:11,725 --> 00:41:12,649
Rym: I wish had more time.

622
00:41:12,669 --> 00:41:16,456
Scott: the Right flips episode.

623
00:41:16,537 --> 00:41:19,530
Scott: flips daughter gets a whole episode, but then you never see her again.

624
00:41:19,691 --> 00:41:21,098
Rym: Yeah, I would like to see her again.

625
00:41:21,601 --> 00:41:30,480
Scott: flip you see occasionally But he never gets his whole episode to learn what I wanted more flip because flip is a lot like why you're gonna get more If you haven't watched the last four episodes.

626
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,587
Scott: you're getting more flaky.

627
00:41:31,607 --> 00:41:33,095
Scott: good good You're getting good flip.

628
00:41:33,296 --> 00:41:36,389
Scott: cuz you're not getting a flip episode where you can learn his deal.

629
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:46,761
Rym: Because I like because flip is like a kingpin to kind of character like floor like wide whale from venture brothers in that He's a bad guy, but you can understand his motivations.

630
00:41:47,082 --> 00:41:56,789
Scott: He's like very harsh, but fair like I love when him and ogami interact right not saying got to the two beast people Melissa or whatever that run the the.

631
00:41:59,138 --> 00:42:01,435
Scott: Oh Let the land.

632
00:42:01,475 --> 00:42:05,170
Rym: the landlords feel like you can make a show about them where they try date.

633
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:06,877
Scott: They obviously have enough.

634
00:42:06,937 --> 00:42:07,700
Scott: there's something there.

635
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,090
Scott: You could obviously make two episodes of what about each of them.

636
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:10,772
Scott: You know how they feel.

637
00:42:10,993 --> 00:42:15,529
Rym: they feel like the characters who like run the bed-and-breakfast in a master Keaton volume.

638
00:42:16,292 --> 00:42:19,469
Rym: Yep, exactly like master Keaton background characters for a story.

639
00:42:20,092 --> 00:42:27,350
Scott: There's all these side characters who I think if the show had gone a little slower Could have still had a fast enough pace to keep things interesting.

640
00:42:27,471 --> 00:42:41,200
Scott: I think the show could have been moving six episodes and done a lot more fun stuff And you could have explored all of those characters and maybe season two will do exactly that because the ending is definitely it's like they they.

641
00:42:41,521 --> 00:42:44,629
Scott: what they've done is the ending is such as not a spoiler.

642
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:52,064
Scott: the ending is such that all of the Mysteries and plots that have been brought up in season one are wrapped up.

643
00:42:52,164 --> 00:42:54,150
Scott: So you're not left cliffhanged.

644
00:42:54,611 --> 00:43:03,409
Scott: Anyway, right, but the state of the world that is that is in you know The new status quo that they have achieved at the end of season one.

645
00:43:04,253 --> 00:43:14,821
Scott: still it doesn't leave mysteries right about all those things that you were worried about like, you know, the religion and the Pharmaceutical company and all that stuff.

646
00:43:14,861 --> 00:43:15,887
Scott: no mysteries anymore.

647
00:43:16,028 --> 00:43:18,130
Scott: You're good You don't need to watch season two, right?

648
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:32,330
Scott: But the state of the world is such that there is still the remaining conflict of you know Beast people and humans in the world right not perfectly at peace leaving well open the door for you know seasons.

649
00:43:32,973 --> 00:43:35,022
Scott: However, many they want to make you know, just need to.

650
00:43:35,344 --> 00:43:40,203
Scott: they would just need to bring in new antagonists right to make another season the religion part sort of like.

651
00:43:40,283 --> 00:43:47,639
Rym: I already really like the show but the speed at which the religion part was introduced and then Escalated was part of how I went from.

652
00:43:47,699 --> 00:44:01,584
Rym: this is a really good show - this is a great show because that Was the kind of thing that would in a normal anime take like an Entire half season to build up and that religion goes from 0 to 60 in like two episodes.

653
00:44:01,925 --> 00:44:02,547
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

654
00:44:02,567 --> 00:44:07,502
Rym: Yeah Beyond that like the sound the voice acting is great.

655
00:44:07,542 --> 00:44:16,167
Rym: The animation is beautiful and A lot of shows that have like animal type characters like anime over the years tend to really skimp out on the animation.

656
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:25,250
Rym: this show Really doubled doubles down on the animal people acting in animal ways and like little details on how transformed they are like the nails.

657
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:27,317
Scott: Oh, it's like I mean, I mean the mink.

658
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:28,140
Scott: the mink needs an.

659
00:44:28,321 --> 00:44:30,087
Rym: oh, she I want a whole series.

660
00:44:30,127 --> 00:44:30,569
Rym: That's just her.

661
00:44:31,715 --> 00:44:33,104
Rym: She's my second favorite character.

662
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:33,809
Scott: Okay?

663
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:41,276
Scott: But yeah, if you are a furry if you are an anime fan If you are not you

664
00:44:41,517 --> 00:44:45,270
Rym: ever seen an anime or ever enjoyed an animal person

665
00:44:45,752 --> 00:44:57,410
Scott: And you have Netflix and you have 12 divided by 2 6 less than say 5 to 6 hours of free time and you can click the skip intro and skip outro button.

666
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:58,440
Scott: Cuz you should intro it.

667
00:44:58,622 --> 00:44:59,289
Rym: you shouldn't click.

668
00:45:00,133 --> 00:45:01,920
Rym: The intro is great and the outro is beautiful.

669
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,269
Scott: Yeah, I'll be only to watch it once they're not like Scott.

670
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,515
Rym: What kind of anime fan are you?

671
00:45:05,596 --> 00:45:08,329
Rym: the rule is you watch the opener every time no matter not.

672
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:10,309
Scott: They're not good enough to watch more than a couple times.

673
00:45:11,236 --> 00:45:16,450
Scott: I think they're the closer I think and you can burn through this show in like five hours and you're stuck inside not going anywhere.

674
00:45:16,572 --> 00:45:16,941
Scott: I know it.

675
00:45:17,491 --> 00:45:19,059
Scott: So I go to open up your Netflix.

676
00:45:19,321 --> 00:45:22,719
Rym: if you listen to GeekNights You have to watch this show like.

677
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,777
Rym: I cannot imagine the person who's hearing the words We're saying right now.

678
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:27,389
Rym: who will not enjoy this anime?

679
00:45:27,972 --> 00:45:35,090
Scott: Someone who I know for a fact that there are people who have listened to GeekNights Wednesday Who are not anime fans and actually don't like anime.

680
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:40,809
Scott: But for some reason that listener listens to this and that person probably won't like this show.

681
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:42,376
Rym: I'll bet that person will.

682
00:45:42,436 --> 00:45:45,207
Rym: if you don't I want to find out why I want you to mess it.

683
00:45:45,288 --> 00:45:45,709
Rym: email me.

684
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:51,110
Scott: Okay, if that person exists the non anime fan listening to anime GeekNights.

685
00:45:51,371 --> 00:45:53,117
Rym: yep, this show is just.

686
00:45:53,518 --> 00:45:55,064
Rym: you know that feeling you get like we talked about.

687
00:45:55,084 --> 00:46:01,070
Rym: there's a lot over the last like decade plus of doing GeekNights, but There's a lot of daras.

688
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:05,509
Rym: We're like we'll watch anime because like we want to review the show or like it's a pretty good show.

689
00:46:06,052 --> 00:46:14,446
Rym: But then there's an anime where at the end of every episode All you want to do is start watching the next episode and those shows are relatively rare.

690
00:46:14,487 --> 00:46:19,930
Rym: as much as I love animation Even really good shows don't always give me that feeling of yeah, I gotta watch another episode.

691
00:46:20,352 --> 00:46:22,543
Rym: This is one of those shows where every episode I finished.

692
00:46:22,643 --> 00:46:27,810
Rym: I just wanted to watch the next one That's that's a high praise and seek out shows like that.

693
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:33,749
Rym: This gave me the same feeling I got every time I walk when I was watching Gundam seed or when I was watching cowboy bebop.

694
00:46:34,572 --> 00:46:37,603
Scott: All right, well studio trigger of course with another good one.

698
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:44,053
