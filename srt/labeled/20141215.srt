1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:13,013
Rym: It's Monday December 15th, 2014.

2
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:13,474
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,754 --> 00:00:14,296
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,396 --> 00:00:15,840
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,338
Rym: Strong artificial intelligence and why it's probably going to destroy us.

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,748
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,912 --> 00:00:28,274
Rym: And why?

8
00:00:28,334 --> 00:00:31,170
Rym: if you have a better idea for a Monday show, you should email us.

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,170
Rym: Geeknights@frontrowcrew.com or post it on our forum.

10
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:39,030
Scott: If you posted an idea and we haven't used it, it's because your idea was bad.

11
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:41,989
Rym: Or we just forgot, so post it again.

12
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,790
Scott: But you'd be surprised how hard it is to come with a valid idea.

13
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,510
Rym: Well, I feel like really what we need to do is when people suggest an idea.

14
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:52,549
Scott: We should tell them why we can't do it, like ConnectiCon feedback panel.

15
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:56,169
Rym: We should do the show about it to show them why.

16
00:00:58,074 --> 00:00:59,990
Rym: Well, I think it comes down to some of these topics.

17
00:01:00,573 --> 00:01:02,030
Scott: I don't want to make a bad show, though.

18
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,550
Rym: We've technically already talked about them in enough depth to where that should be fine.

19
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:06,510
Scott: Like a news or something.

20
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:13,050
Rym: Yeah, people don't search or they're things that would require research, which we don't got time for that.

21
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,390
Rym: If we're going to do research and do like a for real thing about something we don't know.

22
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,490
Scott: That's just us reading Internet and then saying what we saw on the Internet.

23
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:22,530
Scott: And also you can just read the Internet yourself.

24
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:23,970
Rym: Yeah, that's not going to be GeekNights.

25
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,970
Rym: That would be like a YouTube video like how to set up NTP with Rym.

26
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,029
Scott: How to read the Wikipedia page on this topic out loud.

27
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:37,010
Rym: Yeah, or possibly synthesizing the Wikipedia with one or two technical documents.

28
00:01:39,051 --> 00:01:43,990
Rym: Or it's a topic that we just think is stupid or boring and we don't have a lot to say.

29
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:47,930
Scott: Yeah, there's like nothing to say about it or it doesn't fit or et cetera, et cetera.

30
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:51,290
Rym: I feel like we could do a lot more Monday shows if we started focusing more on.

31
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:56,130
Scott: Also, a lot of the people things people suggest are overly broad and not nearly specific enough.

32
00:01:57,655 --> 00:02:02,630
Scott: Or they're so specific that there isn't 30 minutes of stuff to say about them.

33
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:03,312
Rym: Exactly.

34
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:05,530
Rym: In which case we should just do a tech news round.

35
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:06,730
Rym: Yeah.

36
00:02:07,091 --> 00:02:07,334
Rym: Yep.

37
00:02:07,738 --> 00:02:08,949
Rym: Actually, we should do that more often.

38
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:09,412
Rym: We could.

39
00:02:09,453 --> 00:02:11,830
Rym: we could do the show every week just looking at whatever's on the front page.

40
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,379
Scott: But then why even make this show?

41
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:14,930
Scott: Because there are 100 podcasts that do that.

42
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:15,432
Rym: Yeah.

43
00:02:15,452 --> 00:02:18,749
Rym: And the awesome thing is, like I've tried to listen to a lot of those podcasts.

44
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,850
Rym: Those people don't know shit and those podcasts are really bad.

45
00:02:22,512 --> 00:02:28,690
Rym: We could do it better, but that's like being better at a sport that you're good at, but you don't like.

46
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:35,864
Rym: Like making really boring and simple analogies and similes that do exactly like they're.

47
00:02:35,884 --> 00:02:38,730
Rym: so they're so functional and pragmatic.

48
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,388
Scott: What's your news?

49
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,435
Rym: So in the news, I got two things.

50
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:49,349
Rym: I got some science and I got some technology being misunderstood and used inappropriately by people who should know better.

51
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:58,630
Rym: So in science news, evolution is winning our war on HIV and AIDS for us.

52
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,285
Scott: That's good.

53
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,530
Rym: So something awesome is happening.

54
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:06,163
Scott: Well, I mean, HIV itself has the same evolution powers that we do.

55
00:03:06,223 --> 00:03:08,750
Scott: In fact, it should be even faster at evolution than people.

56
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:09,474
Rym: It is.

57
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:10,626
Rym: And this is what's happening.

58
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,489
Scott: So shouldn't it be winning against us?

59
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:14,816
Rym: Ah, so here's what's happening.

60
00:03:14,836 --> 00:03:15,458
Rym: You know what it is?

61
00:03:16,701 --> 00:03:20,010
Rym: It's winning the battles, thereby losing the war.

62
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,273
Rym: So what is happening?

63
00:03:22,814 --> 00:03:28,850
Rym: And I'll link to a slash article that links to an abstract from Oxford and an article explaining this in more detail.

64
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:34,690
Rym: And I apologize to any of our virologist friends, both of you who are going to yell at me for getting this wrong.

65
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:35,628
Scott: You're going to be so wrong.

66
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,010
Scott: I'm glad this isn't my news.

67
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:42,750
Rym: So I'm going to try to say this without saying anything that they can actually call me out on for.

68
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,989
Scott: Well, you're an expert at that.

69
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:44,808
Rym: Yes.

70
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:57,990
Rym: So HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is becoming less virulent in the sense that...

71
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:58,890
Scott: What does virulent even mean?

72
00:03:59,191 --> 00:04:07,910
Rym: So it replicates more slowly because in order... Basically, some people are more resistant to AIDS.

73
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:08,404
Rym: Obviously.

74
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:16,349
Rym: If they get HIV, they get AIDS, you know, the syndrome that's caused by the eventually depleted immune system, depleted by HIV later.

75
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,950
Rym: Those people are more effectively treatable by drugs.

76
00:04:21,091 --> 00:04:33,470
Rym: So in order to replicate better among those people, it replicates slower to avoid triggering the immune responses when the immune system is particularly strong.

77
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:43,127
Rym: When it replicates slower, it's more effectively able to be treated, and this is becoming something that we are now able to measure.

78
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:50,070
Rym: AIDS replicates 10% lower in Botswana than it does in South Africa.

79
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:57,637
Rym: The virus is literally evolving in the places where we can't treat it that effectively.

80
00:04:58,078 --> 00:05:07,510
Rym: to replicate slower and effectively be more treatable because of the selection pressures of the people who are able to spread it and the demographics of those regions and all these things.

81
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:15,506
Rym: Golder added that the average time from infection to the onset of AIDS has increased 25% over the past decade.

82
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:27,830
Rym: So if this evolutionary trend in HIV continues, HIV is rapidly becoming a disease that is not that dangerous.

83
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:33,770
Scott: Well, if it starts losing by going slow, won't it start going faster?

84
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:38,583
Scott: Some HIV mutation will make it go faster.

85
00:05:38,784 --> 00:05:40,530
Scott: That one will catch on all over the place.

86
00:05:40,951 --> 00:05:46,690
Rym: It's tricky because if you go too fast as a virus like this and you kill your host, you're not spreading anymore.

87
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:54,610
Rym: And if you go super slow and spread more widely but do less damage, you might spread more widely but people are less worried about it.

88
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:59,330
Scott: So you just wait until everyone in the world has the AIDS and then you go fast.

89
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:03,230
Rym: Yeah, that's my strategy when I play pandemic as a virus.

90
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,696
Scott: So this article is fascinating.

91
00:06:09,277 --> 00:06:14,930
Rym: Read the actual article because it describes this in much better detail than I ever could.

92
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:21,190
Rym: But the gist of it is evolution is happening in HIV and it's actually working out.

93
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:27,670
Rym: It's like the one time when the thing that's happening that's demonstrable by science is actually the thing we kind of want.

94
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,156
Rym: Like the good answer happens.

95
00:06:29,859 --> 00:06:32,490
Rym: Not like with space, like oh yeah, you'll never get to any other stars.

96
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,550
Rym: Fuck you, speed of light.

97
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:37,403
Rym: Like this time the answer actually fell our way.

98
00:06:37,443 --> 00:06:38,710
Rym: Like everything's coming up Milhouse.

99
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:44,470
Rym: So in other news, Flickr is a platform that allows you to share your photos.

100
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:50,610
Rym: And it is actually, still in my opinion, the best platform in the world to do that.

101
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,279
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's the oldest.

102
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,170
Scott: You might not prefer the interface but it's a good interface.

103
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,336
Rym: Everyone, what are you going to use?

104
00:06:57,437 --> 00:06:58,422
Rym: Fucking Picasa?

105
00:06:58,442 --> 00:06:59,770
Rym: Picasa's bullshit.

106
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,934
Scott: Facebook, right?

107
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:05,210
Scott: I mean, there's some fancy ones like 500px and shit like that.

108
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,950
Rym: Yeah, however, Flickr costs a reasonable amount of money.

109
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:19,350
Scott: Right, that's the biggest thing Flickr has going for it and the reason I've used it forever is because for a flat annual fee that is incredibly low, it's like 25 a year or something like that, it's so cheap.

110
00:07:19,852 --> 00:07:21,559
Scott: You get 100% absolutely unlimited space.

111
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:37,250
Scott: Now there are other services that can give you unlimited space for a reasonable amount of money but those services do not have the photo abilities of Flickr which pretty much takes care of absolutely all of your photo needs ever.

112
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:38,111
Rym: Yup.

113
00:07:38,131 --> 00:07:41,950
Rym: It's also one of the few things Yahoo has that's actually good so they're not going to let it die.

114
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,758
Scott: Well, they bought it.

115
00:07:43,102 --> 00:07:43,829
Scott: They didn't make it.

116
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,668
Rym: No, but of everything that Yahoo owns...

117
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:47,770
Scott: Yahoo Sports and Weather are good.

118
00:07:48,011 --> 00:07:53,190
Rym: Yeah, I was about to say Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Weather, and Yahoo Online Games.

119
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,608
Rym: That plus Flickr is all Yahoo's got going for them.

120
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:02,070
Rym: So Flickr has an option where you can pick the license for your thing.

121
00:08:02,311 --> 00:08:05,089
Scott: Like Flickr was always... Every photo sharing site needs to have that.

122
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,369
Rym: Yeah, but Flickr does a really good job about it.

123
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,490
Scott: They were one of the first places to offer that feature.

124
00:08:10,752 --> 00:08:13,410
Rym: Yeah, they offer that pretty much from the beginning.

125
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,470
Rym: And even better, they give you every useful option.

126
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:27,430
Rym: So I can choose all rights reserved, non-commercial, no derivatives, non-commercial, share alike, non-commercial, no derivatives, share alike, or just attribution which is what I use because I don't care.

127
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:29,090
Rym: Do whatever the fuck you want with my pictures.

128
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:31,270
Scott: I don't think I have pictures that are going to make me any money.

129
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:36,570
Scott: So if you can make money from them, well, that means I'll get noticed and then I'll make money from the next one.

130
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,929
Rym: And if I don't get noticed, I wasn't going to make money anyway.

131
00:08:39,091 --> 00:08:41,321
Scott: You know how many photos there are in the world?

132
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:43,110
Scott: One individual photo is worth nothing.

133
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,871
Rym: And you know what?

134
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:50,950
Rym: If I took a really good photo of a bridge and some magazine uses that instead of paying a guy who took a slightly better photo.

135
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:55,570
Rym: Sucks for slightly better photo guy, but good enough photo works fine.

136
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,130
Scott: Magazine didn't sell extra copies because of your photo.

137
00:09:00,071 --> 00:09:12,310
Rym: So basically what's happening is there's a bunch of sensationalist articles going around about how Flickr is selling your Creative Commons photos for profit and not giving any of that to you.

138
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,258
Scott: This reminds me of the story back in the day.

139
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,890
Scott: Some guy in the UK was putting Firefox on a CD and selling it.

140
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,154
Rym: Oh yeah.

141
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:28,390
Rym: I knew a guy at RIT who sold people CDs with like Nessus or whatever on it and that's all totally OK.

142
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,514
Scott: There's nothing wrong with that.

143
00:09:30,016 --> 00:09:31,221
Scott: Hey, anyone want to buy Ubuntu?

144
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:32,586
Scott: I got some Ubuntu CDs here.

145
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:33,249
Scott: Ubuntu CDs.

146
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:34,370
Scott: $10.

147
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:43,610
Rym: In fact, if anyone would like to buy for me a really modern Linux operating system, I will happily sell it to you for like under $10,000.

148
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:44,290
Scott: Oh yeah, totally.

149
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:47,090
Rym: In fact, it'll be compatible with Red Hat.

150
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:47,883
Rym: Sure.

151
00:09:48,531 --> 00:09:58,810
Rym: So basically morons are mad because they actively tagged their Flickr photos as being attribution only.

152
00:09:59,090 --> 00:09:59,191
Scott: Right.

153
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:01,701
Scott: Well, I mean, the default is all rights reserved.

154
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:03,830
Scott: Meaning you're set to attribution only.

155
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:15,890
Scott: That means you specifically and consciously made a decision or accidentally clicked a not easy to click box to specifically say I want everyone in the Internet to be able to use these photos for anything that they want ever.

156
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,090
Scott: Just give me credit.

157
00:10:17,571 --> 00:10:17,751
Rym: Yep.

158
00:10:18,172 --> 00:10:26,470
Rym: So other people, because there is a non-commercial option, you can trivially say anyone's allowed to use my photo unless they use it commercially.

159
00:10:26,551 --> 00:10:28,549
Rym: But these people didn't do that.

160
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:44,390
Rym: What Flickr is doing is anything on Flickr that's flagged as being usable commercially under Creative Commons license, you can just buy prints and they just take the money and they send the person to print with an attribution sticker and attribution stuff.

161
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:49,458
Scott: So someone else can go to my Flickr account, see one of my photos, give Flickr money.

162
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:56,550
Scott: Flickr will print my photo and send it to them and not give me any money and give me the credit, which is all I asked for.

163
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,088
Rym: Do you know how awesome that is?

164
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,095
Scott: That's actually pretty cool.

165
00:10:59,115 --> 00:11:01,609
Scott: You could buy prints of your own photos without having to print them out.

166
00:11:01,811 --> 00:11:02,525
Rym: Yeah, or like...

167
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,210
Scott: And they're probably going to be way high quality.

168
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:07,585
Rym: If my mom wants a print of something, she can just do it on her own.

169
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,690
Rym: She doesn't even need to talk to me.

170
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:22,470
Rym: So literally everyone who is mad about this is one, using technology improperly, two, actively made a poor decision, and three, misunderstands the ramifications of that active, poor decision.

171
00:11:24,632 --> 00:11:33,790
Rym: If you don't know what you're clicking on, either don't click on it or read the documentation, or click on it and accept the consequences of what you clicked on.

172
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,935
Scott: Yeah, you can't complain about it.

173
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:39,844
Scott: It'd be one thing if the default was attribution only, but it's not.

174
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,989
Scott: So shut up.

175
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:44,935
Rym: And these people are really mad.

176
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:49,745
Rym: and there's all this vitriol going around about how Flickr's selling my photos without permission.

177
00:11:49,765 --> 00:11:52,150
Rym: Like, no, Flickr's selling them with your express permission.

178
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,444
Scott: Explicit, expressed written consent.

179
00:11:54,504 --> 00:11:54,948
Scott: You gave it.

180
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:03,272
Rym: To use a real world analogy, this would be like if I took a table, like an old table, and I put it... And this is a real story.

181
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:03,854
Rym: I did this.

182
00:12:03,954 --> 00:12:09,830
Rym: Yeah, we had an old table, the previous table, the other table at RIT, and we had to get rid of it.

183
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:13,641
Rym: So we put it outside our apartment and we put a sign on it.

184
00:12:14,002 --> 00:12:16,830
Rym: that said this is our apartment, come inside.

185
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:22,762
Rym: Either take it for free or if you want, come give us like 20 bucks for it.

186
00:12:23,324 --> 00:12:23,885
Rym: And you know what?

187
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:25,910
Rym: Later in the day I went out and it was gone.

188
00:12:26,931 --> 00:12:33,429
Rym: If I then complained that someone exercised option one as opposed to option two, I'm a moron.

189
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:34,686
Scott: Yes, you are.

190
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:37,976
Rym: So, yeah, that's my news.

191
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:40,021
Rym: I just really got to get ahead of this.

192
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:43,450
Rym: The people who are mad about this are dumb, and if you're mad about it, you're dumb.

193
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,273
Scott: Alright, another news.

194
00:12:46,353 --> 00:12:48,517
Scott: Tomorrow, a news is gonna happen.

195
00:12:49,118 --> 00:12:55,930
Scott: For the 8th time, T-Mobile is gonna have some un-carrier conference thingy, which is pretty much like the Apple keynote of T-Mobile.

196
00:12:56,611 --> 00:13:02,786
Scott: Where they do it every quarter, and they come out and they talk about how they're so much better than all the other carriers.

197
00:13:02,806 --> 00:13:04,130
Scott: Look at all the good stuff that we're gonna do.

198
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:08,029
Rym: Yeah, they're better until you get more than 10 miles outside of any major metropolitan area.

199
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,031
Scott: So here's the thing.

200
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:13,117
Scott: It's like, T-Mobile, I want to use you as my carrier.

201
00:13:13,218 --> 00:13:15,201
Scott: In so many ways, you are correct.

202
00:13:15,221 --> 00:13:21,470
Scott: You are definitely taking the path that I would take if I was a phone wireless provider in the United States.

203
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,915
Scott: Do the things that other people aren't doing.

204
00:13:23,316 --> 00:13:23,979
Scott: No bullshit.

205
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:27,010
Scott: Contracts, no locking people.

206
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,807
Rym: Global free international roaming, which I use monthly.

207
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:32,232
Scott: Right, yeah.

208
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,937
Scott: All these kind of awesome things, right?

209
00:13:34,258 --> 00:13:36,043
Scott: Here are the problems you got, T-Mobile.

210
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,166
Scott: Here are the problems.

211
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:38,470
Scott: The reason I'm still using Verizon.

212
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,899
Rym: Alright, I'm really curious what these are.

213
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,510
Rym: Because it's not like you ever fucking leave the city.

214
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:44,735
Scott: No, but that, yeah.

215
00:13:44,936 --> 00:13:46,686
Scott: Well, I mean, Verizon, I can go around the world too.

216
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:47,270
Scott: It's not a problem.

217
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,638
Rym: You don't get free roaming.

218
00:13:48,658 --> 00:13:50,190
Rym: You don't get data roaming for free.

219
00:13:50,571 --> 00:13:51,655
Scott: It's shitty 2G roaming.

220
00:13:51,695 --> 00:13:55,070
Scott: I'm still gonna pay to get 4Gs when I go to some other country.

221
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,970
Rym: Scott, I can pay like 10 bucks and get like a gig of 4G in those countries.

222
00:13:59,373 --> 00:13:59,755
Scott: That's fine.

223
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:01,970
Scott: I can pay 10 bucks and buy a SIM card in those other countries.

224
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,410
Rym: Yeah, and then you have to go activate it and all that bullshit as opposed to it starts working when you land.

225
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,011
Rym: That's alright.

226
00:14:07,572 --> 00:14:10,961
Scott: Anyway, here are the problems with T-Mobile.

227
00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:13,567
Scott: Number one, you're not actually any goddamn cheaper.

228
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:14,690
Scott: Not at all.

229
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,470
Scott: In fact, sometimes more expensive.

230
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:25,868
Rym: With all taxes and fees combined, for my effectively unlimited data whatever plan, unlimited everything, $74 a month after taxes and fees.

231
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:27,552
Rym: That's right.

232
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:28,456
Scott: And here's the thing.

233
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,440
Scott: I pay like a hundred.

234
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,203
Scott: So wait a minute.

235
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:31,307
Scott: That's not right.

236
00:14:31,428 --> 00:14:32,010
Scott: It is cheaper.

237
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:36,129
Scott: It's not because you don't have any subsidized phones.

238
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,769
Scott: So you gotta pay full price for the phone.

239
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,010
Rym: I buy unlocked phones unsubsidized anyway.

240
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,149
Scott: And how much do they cost?

241
00:14:43,971 --> 00:14:47,870
Rym: Well, I paid I think like 200 bucks for this Nexus 4.

242
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,088
Scott: Oh, for a crapo phone.

243
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:51,950
Scott: If you get an iPhone, how much would you have to pay?

244
00:14:52,252 --> 00:14:52,756
Rym: A list.

245
00:14:52,796 --> 00:14:52,937
Rym: So

246
00:14:52,937 --> 00:14:54,810
Rym: $750? $740?

247
00:14:54,810 --> 00:15:02,189
Scott: Yeah, if you take the $750 plus the T-Mobile lower cost compared to like my $300 and the increased pricing cost.

248
00:15:02,731 --> 00:15:03,910
Rym: Actually, I calculated this.

249
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,010
Scott: Over the two years, it actually works out so that it's about even.

250
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,417
Rym: Yeah, that's what I was about to say.

251
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,485
Rym: I did that calculation.

252
00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:11,230
Rym: It's about the same.

253
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,072
Scott: It's about the same.

254
00:15:12,713 --> 00:15:23,350
Scott: So if I'm paying about the same, then why would I go somewhere that has, even though I agree with many of your policies, you're just slower and just less reliable?

255
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,016
Rym: I wouldn't say it's slower.

256
00:15:25,117 --> 00:15:27,370
Rym: The 4G is fucking wicked fast.

257
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,750
Scott: Yeah, but have you used a Verizon with LTE?

258
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:32,721
Rym: Yeah, I've seen it.

259
00:15:32,742 --> 00:15:33,510
Rym: It's like it's not.

260
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:35,917
Scott: It is night in the day.

261
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:37,625
Scott: I've used the T-Mobile at work.

262
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:38,850
Scott: It is not so good.

263
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:46,050
Rym: I was in Istanbul and Germany and London all in the span of a few days, landing in all those countries along the way.

264
00:15:46,471 --> 00:15:53,950
Rym: There's no easy way to have gotten data in all those places without spending a lot of time at multiple airports or paying a ton of money.

265
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,987
Scott: Walk into a drug store, grab a SIM card, pop it in.

266
00:15:57,611 --> 00:15:58,226
Rym: Yeah, if you go...

267
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,067
Scott: Type some numbers in.

268
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,657
Rym: Scott, how often have you traveled?

269
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,950
Rym: Try that and see how quickly it all works.

270
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:08,370
Rym: Also, if you do that in Istanbul, that SIM card gets blocked about two hours after you activate it.

271
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:08,889
Scott: Why?

272
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,033
Rym: Because of the laws.

273
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:14,210
Rym: You're not allowed to use foreign phones in Turkey with local data plans.

274
00:16:14,697 --> 00:16:14,948
Scott: Uh-huh.

275
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:16,717
Rym: A lot of countries have bullshit like that.

276
00:16:16,998 --> 00:16:19,930
Rym: Trust me, I travel internationally a lot.

277
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:25,290
Rym: Buying a SIM card in the airport and putting it in your phone often has problems.

278
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:26,949
Scott: There's a solution.

279
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,477
Rym: Yeah, you know what the solution is?

280
00:16:28,497 --> 00:16:29,464
Rym: I have T-Mobile.

281
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:30,230
Rym: I land there.

282
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,127
Scott: And you got crappy 2Gs.

283
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,031
Rym: You know what?

284
00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:38,030
Rym: That 2G is actually pretty fine because a lot of the times I end up getting HSPA speeds anyway.

285
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:42,030
Scott: Also, I would never travel to a country that didn't have freedom of speech in that way.

286
00:16:42,692 --> 00:16:45,250
Rym: So you don't want to ever visit Istanbul?

287
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:50,150
Scott: Just like I wouldn't take a job that blocked the internet, I wouldn't go to a country that blocked the internet.

288
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,990
Rym: Yeah, you're not going to go to a lot of countries.

289
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,249
Scott: Yeah, I'm not.

290
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,683
Rym: Okay, you're not going to see... You keep talking about.

291
00:16:55,703 --> 00:16:56,610
Rym: you want to see the old shit.

292
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:03,110
Scott: And you're lucky I'm not in charge of this country because I would say, "Hey, if your country's evil, no one from your country is allowed here and we're deporting anyone who is

293
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:03,210
Scott: here.".

294
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:03,833
Rym: Yeah, Scott, you know what?

295
00:17:04,074 --> 00:17:08,010
Rym: The old shit in Europe is like baby's first castle compared to Istanbul.

296
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:08,730
Rym: Yeah.

297
00:17:09,051 --> 00:17:09,310
Rym: Just saying.

298
00:17:09,672 --> 00:17:11,138
Scott: I know that, but that doesn't matter.

299
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,250
Scott: If your country is evil, I'm not going to go to it.

300
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:17,338
Rym: Okay, anyway, as I'm saying, I travel around a lot in the world.

301
00:17:17,358 --> 00:17:17,779
Rym: You know what?

302
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,109
Rym: The fact that as soon as I land in any country in the world except North Korea and Somalia...

303
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,814
Scott: 2G, I might as well have nothing.

304
00:17:23,954 --> 00:17:26,359
Scott: It's like I have free internet everywhere I go.

305
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,262
Scott: It's a dial-up modem.

306
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:28,223
Scott: But it's free internet.

307
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,267
Scott: It's worthless.

308
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:30,510
Scott: 2G is nothing.

309
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,392
Rym: Yeah, you know what, Scott?

310
00:17:31,854 --> 00:17:35,003
Rym: I used it as my internet when I was in Australia last time.

311
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:35,504
Rym: You know what?

312
00:17:36,066 --> 00:17:36,387
Rym: It was 100% fine.

313
00:17:37,872 --> 00:17:40,330
Rym: The only thing I couldn't do was watch YouTube videos on it.

314
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:46,090
Scott: When I was in Australia, when I had the 3G because the 4G didn't work, it was suffering.

315
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:47,591
Rym: How?

316
00:17:47,832 --> 00:17:49,336
Rym: I don't remember you suffering.

317
00:17:49,356 --> 00:17:51,863
Rym: In fact, I had H-G-S-P-A+.

318
00:17:51,944 --> 00:17:52,786
Rym: It was wicked fast.

319
00:17:52,846 --> 00:17:54,190
Rym: It was totally fine the whole time.

320
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:55,249
Scott: It was many slownesses.

321
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,300
Rym: I did not have this problem.

322
00:17:57,341 --> 00:17:58,610
Rym: The fuck are you doing on the phone?

323
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,144
Scott: It's because your... Because the thing is...

324
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:01,856
Rym: Scott, that wasn't T-Mobile.

325
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,550
Rym: I had the same fucking SIM card you did last time.

326
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,098
Scott: Because you are not used to the... See, this is the thing.

327
00:18:07,118 --> 00:18:11,010
Scott: You don't have the incredible LTE speed of New York Verizon that I have.

328
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,480
Scott: So it doesn't seem slow to you.

329
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:13,870
Scott: That's what's going on here.

330
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:14,860
Rym: Scott, I go to a web page.

331
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,830
Rym: It loads instantly.

332
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:21,709
Scott: You don't realize how slow it is because you have... It's like saying, "Oh man, my car is crazy fast because I'm driving a

333
00:18:21,729 --> 00:18:21,930
Scott: Ferrari.".

334
00:18:22,091 --> 00:18:22,573
Scott: You don't know.

335
00:18:22,995 --> 00:18:23,719
Scott: You just don't know.

336
00:18:24,745 --> 00:18:25,509
Scott: You don't know what fast is.

337
00:18:26,111 --> 00:18:28,587
Rym: I don't think that level of fat... Scott, I...

338
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:33,230
Scott: I'll trade phones with you for a day and then we'll trade back and we'll see what happens.

339
00:18:34,152 --> 00:18:34,959
Rym: Yeah, fine.

340
00:18:35,343 --> 00:18:36,210
Rym: Like, okay.

341
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,790
Scott: Yeah, see how willing you are to take my much superior phone.

342
00:18:40,372 --> 00:18:42,750
Rym: No, because I'm not convinced it's that much of a difference.

343
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,469
Rym: So anyway, those are your reasons?

344
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:45,599
Rym: Yeah.

345
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:46,230
Rym: Okay.

346
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:50,080
Scott: But yeah, no, they're going to announce something tomorrow that's supposedly crazy awesome.

347
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,710
Scott: that will give us even more faith in them being the uncaring.

348
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,289
Rym: Yeah, well, the thing is it doesn't matter because...

349
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,469
Scott: Well, maybe it's increased speed and lower prices.

350
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,430
Rym: I'm just continuing to use my Nexus 4.

351
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:05,910
Rym: Because honestly, now that I got Lollipop, Lollipop's fucking amazing.

352
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:11,350
Rym: Android is accelerating in terms of being not shitty, like rapidly with Lollipop.

353
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:16,810
Rym: And my battery lasts like 20 to 40% longer and like everything's great.

354
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:21,389
Rym: I'm really glad I didn't buy a new phone because a lot of those new phones don't have Lollipop yet.

355
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:22,708
Scott: Mm-hmm.

356
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:29,986
Rym: So pretty much, I think, unless this phone breaks, I'm just going to wait until Lollipop drops on that Z3C.

357
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:37,690
Rym: And if it does and it doesn't break the Z3C, I'm going to buy a cheap Z3C, probably great market.

358
00:19:38,035 --> 00:19:38,949
Rym: And that'll be my new phone.

359
00:19:39,852 --> 00:19:40,376
Scott: That's another thing.

360
00:19:40,497 --> 00:19:42,169
Scott: iPhones just updates all the time.

361
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:45,410
Scott: You don't have to wait based on the carrier, based on the phone.

362
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:50,670
Rym: You don't if you buy a just standard Android phone.

363
00:19:50,893 --> 00:19:52,110
Rym: It just upgrades immediately.

364
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:58,950
Rym: The problem is that all these companies, they put their bullshit carrier specific garbage on the phone.

365
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,946
Scott: iPhone, they're not allowed to put carrier specific garbage on the iPhone.

366
00:20:01,986 --> 00:20:02,710
Scott: Apple doesn't let them.

367
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,572
Rym: Yeah, but the iPhone's $750.

368
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:07,651
Scott: No, it's actually like $200 or $300.

369
00:20:07,651 --> 00:20:08,430
Rym: Yeah, because you get it subsidized.

370
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,690
Scott: Well, you're paying the same amount either way.

371
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:16,410
Rym: Yeah, except I can buy a gray market version of one of these phones way cheaper.

372
00:20:17,232 --> 00:20:19,709
Scott: I'm sure I can go steal an iPhone for way cheaper.

373
00:20:20,092 --> 00:20:23,550
Rym: Yes, I'll just pirate an iPhone and print it in my 3D printer.

374
00:20:23,871 --> 00:20:24,578
Scott: I wish I could.

375
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,063
Scott: What if I could?

376
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,404
Rym: You wouldn't download a car.

377
00:20:27,424 --> 00:20:27,909
Rym: Fuck you.

378
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:29,810
Scott: If I could download a car, I would.

379
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,208
Scott: I'd download a jet first though.

380
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:36,530
Rym: Scott, if you could download a jet, that would be the day that you died.

381
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:37,729
Scott: Why would I die?

382
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,230
Rym: How would you pilot a jet?

383
00:20:40,395 --> 00:20:41,169
Scott: I'd print out a pilot.

384
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,200
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

385
00:20:51,381 --> 00:20:54,118
Rym: This is a photo from an earlier time.

386
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,519
Scott: That's just a photo?

387
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:03,400
Rym: It's just a photo because it's a photo that needs to be seen more widely to remind people of some facts.

388
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:19,000
Rym: For example, for all you weirdly misogynistic computer science nerds who are mad about women in your spaces and whatever, computer programming was seen as women's work until relatively recently in the grand scheme of the history of computers.

389
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:24,360
Scott: It was pretty much, oh mostly women had that job for the first few decades that the job existed.

390
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,940
Scott: It wasn't until the 80s, 90s that it switched over.

391
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:36,560
Rym: Yeah, so if you don't know the names of people like Grace Hopper or Margaret Hamilton, and you're simultaneously one of those nerd programmer equivalents.

392
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,220
Scott: Then you're someone who's not listening to this podcast.

393
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,799
Rym: Yeah, so you know what?

394
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,219
Rym: Spread this around, you who do listen to your idiot friends in CS.

395
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:43,920
Rym: But anyway.

396
00:21:44,061 --> 00:21:46,160
Scott: Maybe one Unix beard will see it.

397
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:59,060
Rym: This is just a wonderful photo of a woman named Margaret Hamilton, the NASA lead software engineer who wrote the Apollo Guidance Program, and the source code was printed out because this was a long time ago.

398
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,179
Rym: That's what they did in those days.

399
00:22:00,382 --> 00:22:00,469
Scott: Yeah.

400
00:22:01,683 --> 00:22:03,099
Scott: How else was everyone going to debug it?

401
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:07,240
Scott: Sit in the terminal in the VT100s and scroll through it?

402
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,820
Rym: Going to read your fucking punch card?

403
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,819
Scott: You had to go through it.

404
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,280
Scott: Read it on the paper with a red pen.

405
00:22:12,763 --> 00:22:19,940
Rym: It's a photo of her standing next to the printed out source code of the Apollo Guidance Program that she wrote.

406
00:22:21,043 --> 00:22:22,517
Rym: This is just an awesome photo.

407
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,180
Scott: Written in some nasty old program like some assembly shit.

408
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,039
Rym: You know what though?

409
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:36,260
Rym: If you're smart and you go read that, a smart person who knows how computers work could read that code probably more effectively than they could read a lot of modern garbage.

410
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:36,756
Rym: Oh yeah.

411
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,480
Scott: It's probably quite readable.

412
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,259
Scott: At the low level.

413
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,820
Scott: Pretty sure you can get the code online.

414
00:22:41,164 --> 00:22:42,780
Rym: Yeah, like old programming.

415
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:46,080
Rym: It's just, what do I need to do?

416
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,840
Rym: I've got to calculate some things and put them in these registers so something can happen.

417
00:22:50,121 --> 00:22:50,538
Rym: Like, go nuts.

418
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,340
Rym: Variables in memory or not.

419
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,459
Scott: Really, the input is pretty much just, where do you want to go?

420
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,500
Scott: And the output is, thrust the rockets this way.

421
00:22:59,882 --> 00:23:00,035
Rym: Yep.

422
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,920
Rym: Maybe a feedback loop of, am I there yet?

423
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:03,368
Rym: Nope.

424
00:23:03,532 --> 00:23:03,819
Rym: Why?

425
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,977
Scott: Check where I am.

426
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,339
Scott: Thrust some more.

427
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,297
Scott: Check where I am.

428
00:23:07,621 --> 00:23:08,260
Scott: Where am I going?

429
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:08,880
Scott: Thrust some more.

430
00:23:08,941 --> 00:23:10,100
Rym: You're not passing around a bunch of objects.

431
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,880
Scott: The program is just- Check all the sensors in this rocket.

432
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,599
Scott: What do they say?

433
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,260
Scott: Do some math, thrust some rockets.

434
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,680
Rym: I mean, old programming is basically, what do I do next?

435
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,879
Rym: Okay, now what do I do?

436
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:20,739
Rym: Okay, now what do I do?

437
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,297
Scott: Also, put out some numbers on the screen so the astronauts can see it.

438
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,359
Scott: Send it over the radio so Houston can see it.

439
00:23:26,701 --> 00:23:27,459
Rym: All right, so what do you got?

440
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,300
Scott: So, remember we did an episode last week about the bus.

441
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,178
Rym: Macadamia.

442
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:36,579
Scott: Yeah, not that bus, but that's a good bus.

443
00:23:37,263 --> 00:23:40,720
Scott: Here is a video taken on a New York City bus.

444
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,900
Rym: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

445
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,960
Rym: This rig's a WorldStar.

446
00:23:44,021 --> 00:23:48,398
Scott: Well, the YouTube account that posted it is WorldStarHip- Oh, WorldStar.

447
00:23:49,341 --> 00:24:08,390
Scott: WorldStarHipHoop is the name of the YouTube account, but it's pretty much just a dude on the bus and the bus is going slow and late and in traffic as usual, and it also got slowed down because a disabled person got on the bus, which by the way, if you're a disabled person, getting around New York City is really awful,

448
00:24:09,212 --> 00:24:09,353
Rym: even

449
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:12,400
Scott: if you use the bus and AccessorRide.

450
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,678
Rym: Well, AccessorRide, so get this- AccessorRide sucks too.

451
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,560
Scott: You got to give AccessorRide- And of course, handicap accessible cabs.

452
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,759
Scott: They ain't going to pick your ass up.

453
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:19,233
Rym: Yup.

454
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:26,918
Rym: And also, all the subway stations that matter are so old, like 100 years old, that they don't have elevators.

455
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,779
Rym: And even if they did, the platforms are too small.

456
00:24:30,241 --> 00:24:33,379
Scott: Yeah, if you live where I am, the subway isn't going to get you.

457
00:24:34,483 --> 00:24:35,679
Rym: Dude, Queensborough Plaza.

458
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,499
Scott: You got to come all the way to where a Rym is and you can only go to Queens Plaza, not Queensborough Plaza.

459
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,400
Rym: Yeah, Queensborough Plaza is one of the most used subway stations in New York.

460
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,197
Rym: Stairs only.

461
00:24:44,801 --> 00:24:47,180
Rym: Do you know how many stories up you have to go?

462
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,799
Scott: Queens Plaza has an elevator though.

463
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:58,100
Rym: Yeah, guys, I live in the third story of a building that has super tall floors and the platform for the Astoria-bound trains is higher than me.

464
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,836
Scott: Right, so anyway, someone got on the bus with a wheelchair, so it slowed the bus down even more.

465
00:25:03,482 --> 00:25:06,100
Scott: And there's some cranky old lady on the bus who's complaining.

466
00:25:06,661 --> 00:25:10,500
Scott: And there's some guy and he's just like, you know, they're going to work in the morning.

467
00:25:10,764 --> 00:25:11,460
Scott: They're all late.

468
00:25:11,865 --> 00:25:12,820
Scott: It's all too early.

469
00:25:13,122 --> 00:25:16,160
Scott: And this lady's yapping, saying this is bullshit and complaining.

470
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,000
Scott: And he's like, I had enough of this shit.

471
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,639
Scott: I'm going to tug back to you.

472
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,678
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

473
00:25:21,283 --> 00:25:21,860
Rym: This video is great.

474
00:25:21,941 --> 00:25:22,415
Rym: I watched it.

475
00:25:22,982 --> 00:25:25,340
Scott: So he smacks that old lady down.

476
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:26,719
Rym: We're all late.

477
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:27,599
Rym: Everybody's late.

478
00:25:27,942 --> 00:25:29,478
Scott: Nice little tongue lashing going on.

479
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:30,580
Rym: Just love it.

480
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,520
Rym: Like everybody's late.

481
00:25:31,762 --> 00:25:33,839
Rym: You're mad because you got a shit ass job.

482
00:25:34,602 --> 00:25:35,840
Rym: You're late to your shit job.

483
00:25:36,606 --> 00:25:37,120
Rym: It's great.

484
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,819
Scott: I'm not upset about being late to my job.

485
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,619
Scott: What's the worst I got?

486
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,218
Scott: I'll get a new shit ass job.

487
00:25:44,282 --> 00:25:46,460
Rym: This warmed the cockles of my heart, this video.

488
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,919
Scott: And this is why the bus is not a good place to be.

489
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:54,177
Scott: It's also why I love living in New York, because you got to sit in uncomfortable situations like that.

490
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,000
Rym: Yeah.

491
00:25:55,241 --> 00:25:57,500
Rym: Thing is, that situation is not uncomfortable.

492
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,200
Rym: I would because, you know, if you live in New York, it gets a lot worse.

493
00:26:01,301 --> 00:26:01,451
Scott: Yeah.

494
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:10,900
Rym: But if you live in New York, like whenever things go down, like all the people who aren't crazy are on the like, you know, like two people get in a fight on the subway.

495
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,051
Rym: Right.

496
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:23,060
Rym: There's like a couple hundred other people like crammed into that car, either trying not to be involved, but or actively like videoing it or, you know, yelling or whatever.

497
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:31,220
Rym: But the most beautiful thing is that everyone who's not involved is all making eye contact with each other, sharing this look of, can you believe this shit?

498
00:26:31,402 --> 00:26:31,758
Rym: Oh, man.

499
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,960
Rym: Look, look what's going on right there.

500
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,296
Rym: Look at this.

501
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:33,840
Rym: Look at this.

502
00:26:33,941 --> 00:26:34,640
Rym: I think he's about to hit him.

503
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,093
Rym: Oh, man.

504
00:26:37,261 --> 00:26:39,459
Rym: Because none of it happens every day.

505
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:45,280
Rym: It's like the people who get into a fight don't realize that it happens every day in the moment.

506
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,500
Rym: The Book Club book is Watership Down.

507
00:26:48,223 --> 00:26:50,640
Scott: It's a handful of chapters now.

508
00:26:50,921 --> 00:26:54,280
Scott: And I can tell you that here are some things that I know about it.

509
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,159
Scott: Number one, it opens up.

510
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:59,640
Scott: It does that thing a lot of books do with the quotes at the beginning of every chapter.

511
00:27:00,261 --> 00:27:02,819
Rym: Did you did you read the authors like, here's how I wrote the book?

512
00:27:03,603 --> 00:27:04,899
Scott: No, I don't know if that's in my edition.

513
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:10,917
Scott: Oh, oh, oh, because there's something interesting I could tell you about the quote at the beginning of chapter one.

514
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:11,419
Scott: Yeah.

515
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,900
Scott: It's from my boy like a lamb none.

516
00:27:14,423 --> 00:27:14,528
Rym: Yeah.

517
00:27:15,444 --> 00:27:16,580
Scott: And so that's a positive.

518
00:27:16,782 --> 00:27:16,929
Rym: Yeah.

519
00:27:17,801 --> 00:27:20,651
Scott: Other than that, so far, it seems like it's like.

520
00:27:20,751 --> 00:27:27,000
Scott: obviously it's not the same story, but it's pretty much the same kind of book as Lord of the Flies, only with rabbits.

521
00:27:27,801 --> 00:27:32,060
Scott: Like each person is representing some one aspect of society, whatever.

522
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,100
Rym: So, you know, so, Scott, the author literally has said openly, this is not allegory.

523
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,340
Rym: Nobody is symbolic of anything.

524
00:27:40,922 --> 00:27:44,460
Rym: It is just a story of rabbits trying to find a new home.

525
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,799
Scott: Tolkien said the same thing.

526
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,271
Rym: Yes.

527
00:27:46,862 --> 00:27:47,899
Rym: So you can try.

528
00:27:48,381 --> 00:27:50,860
Rym: I encourage you to continue to try to read in those aspects.

529
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:53,779
Scott: But you got the military guy.

530
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:53,964
Scott: Yeah.

531
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,380
Scott: Peasant rabbit.

532
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,460
Scott: You know, normal guy rabbit.

533
00:27:57,822 --> 00:27:59,739
Rym: So I'll say this.

534
00:28:00,701 --> 00:28:05,880
Rym: Every one of those rabbits is like you're going to expect the book to go in like a particular academic rabbit.

535
00:28:06,522 --> 00:28:09,400
Rym: The rabbits are all going to like surprise you a bunch of times.

536
00:28:09,742 --> 00:28:12,159
Rym: And it doesn't go in the direction you think it's going at all.

537
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:12,595
Rym: Whatever.

538
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,680
Rym: Also, big wigs.

539
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,258
Rym: My man.

540
00:28:14,762 --> 00:28:15,880
Scott: Also, Agamemnon.

541
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:16,552
Scott: Yeah.

542
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:20,100
Scott: People don't know how bad ass Agamemnon is right.

543
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:20,860
Scott: I didn't even learn.

544
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:21,380
Rym: You know what?

545
00:28:21,481 --> 00:28:22,040
Rym: You are a badass.

546
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,780
Rym: Agamemnon is going toe to toe with Achilles.

547
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,140
Scott: But that's what I'm saying is like so Achilles is basically invincible.

548
00:28:28,421 --> 00:28:31,560
Scott: The baddest ass motherfucker in the whole world.

549
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:35,520
Scott: And he could only be killed by this weakness that no one even knows.

550
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,659
Scott: And it was random chance.

551
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:37,580
Scott: Right.

552
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:38,520
Scott: And Achilles.

553
00:28:38,782 --> 00:28:41,080
Scott: You think someone's so bad ass, wouldn't they be the king?

554
00:28:41,323 --> 00:28:42,479
Scott: But Achilles is not the king.

555
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:43,999
Scott: Agamemnon is the king.

556
00:28:44,343 --> 00:28:46,400
Scott: And Achilles does what Agamemnon fucking says.

557
00:28:46,521 --> 00:28:47,557
Scott: That's how bad as he is.

558
00:28:48,825 --> 00:28:49,359
Rym: Of course, then.

559
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:50,700
Scott: Agamemnon says Achilles.

560
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:51,599
Scott: Lick my foot.

561
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,117
Scott: He says I.

562
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:57,100
Rym: So it's got if Agamemnon is that bad ass compared to Achilles.

563
00:28:57,422 --> 00:28:58,559
Rym: How bad ass is Hector?

564
00:29:02,466 --> 00:29:03,199
Scott: Don't even go there.

565
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:03,409
Rym: Yeah.

566
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:03,939
Rym: Don't even.

567
00:29:04,281 --> 00:29:04,539
Rym: Of course.

568
00:29:04,961 --> 00:29:06,220
Rym: You can't be too hubris here.

569
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:06,729
Rym: I'll stop.

570
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,216
Rym: Besides coming down.

571
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,058
Rym: Besides, like, what's this?

572
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,119
Scott: The baddest of all asses is me.

573
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,077
Scott: Don't forget it.

574
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:14,600
Scott: Yes.

575
00:29:15,043 --> 00:29:16,077
Scott: Oh, you did forget it.

576
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,459
Scott: That's a shame.

577
00:29:20,723 --> 00:29:20,786
Scott: Oh.

578
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,438
Scott: Agamemnon.

579
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:23,459
Scott: You wet your bed.

580
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:24,559
Rym: What happened?

581
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,200
Rym: That's a shame.

582
00:29:26,545 --> 00:29:27,018
Rym: Everyone look.

583
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,179
Rym: Agamemnon wet the bed.

584
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:29,765
Rym: Oh.

585
00:29:30,716 --> 00:29:30,758
Rym: Oh.

586
00:29:31,387 --> 00:29:31,560
Rym: Oh.

587
00:29:32,065 --> 00:29:33,199
Rym: You think you can repudiate me?

588
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:33,959
Rym: You're going to.

589
00:29:34,102 --> 00:29:34,599
Scott: Oh, wait, wait.

590
00:29:34,681 --> 00:29:35,820
Scott: Are you about to get in a boat?

591
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:37,302
Scott: Oh.

592
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,740
Scott: Oh, I'm sorry.

593
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:39,349
Rym: Oh.

594
00:29:39,741 --> 00:29:41,139
Rym: You'll just never get into a boat again.

595
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:41,656
Rym: Yeah.

596
00:29:41,701 --> 00:29:42,120
Rym: Guess what?

597
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,300
Scott: Oh, you're stuck in one place on this tiny island for the rest of your life.

598
00:29:45,488 --> 00:29:45,779
Scott: All right.

599
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:46,760
Scott: Don't get in any boats.

600
00:29:47,062 --> 00:29:48,260
Rym: Oh, is that a food boat coming?

601
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:48,835
Rym: Oh, no.

602
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:49,376
Rym: It sank.

603
00:29:50,361 --> 00:29:50,777
Rym: That sucks.

604
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:52,444
Scott: Oh.

605
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,959
Scott: Too bad planes weren't invented yet.

606
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:02,040
Rym: I always imagine the Greek gods just being along the lines of Poseidon being a super dick to everyone and every other god being like, man, he's such a dick.

607
00:30:02,622 --> 00:30:03,260
Scott: Oh, here's a boat.

608
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:03,658
Scott: Don't worry.

609
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,579
Scott: I won't sink this one.

610
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,220
Scott: I'll just move the sirens real close to it, like.

611
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,457
Rym: But yet they never call him a dick to his face because then he'll start being a dick to them.

612
00:30:11,281 --> 00:30:14,320
Rym: It's like, he's being a dick to Agamemnon or he's being a dick to Odysseus.

613
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,979
Rym: So I'm just going to hang out over here and let that happen.

614
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:19,380
Rym: So.

615
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:19,813
Rym: Yeah.

616
00:30:20,441 --> 00:30:23,239
Rym: Well, tell me when you get to the cult rabbits.

617
00:30:24,941 --> 00:30:28,880
Scott: They are they prasing on their you're in a little bit.

618
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:34,220
Rym: So basically, you're at the point where there's Hazel, the smart rabbit and Fiverr, who's like, man, shit's going to get fucked up.

619
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,400
Rym: We should get the fuck out of here.

620
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,360
Scott: The prophetic religious rabbit.

621
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:37,820
Rym: Yeah.

622
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,207
Rym: Yeah.

623
00:30:38,521 --> 00:30:38,692
Rym: Yeah.

624
00:30:39,263 --> 00:30:40,678
Rym: So did they leave yet?

625
00:30:41,063 --> 00:30:41,516
Scott: Yeah, they left.

626
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,127
Rym: Now.

627
00:30:43,263 --> 00:30:44,900
Scott: So they crossed a river or some shit.

628
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:45,499
Rym: Oh, yeah.

629
00:30:45,642 --> 00:30:45,880
Rym: All right.

630
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,080
Rym: Yeah.

631
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,159
Rym: The book moves real quick.

632
00:30:47,542 --> 00:30:48,280
Scott: It does move real quick.

633
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:48,898
Scott: Like rabbits.

634
00:30:50,043 --> 00:30:51,360
Rym: Wait till you get to the cult rabbits.

635
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,660
Rym: I think that's where you're going to go from.

636
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:53,217
Rym: This book's OK.

637
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,638
Rym: You're going to start really liking this book.

638
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:59,400
Scott: Well, the cultist rabbits are too much book club and not book club episode.

639
00:30:59,626 --> 00:30:59,979
Rym: All right.

640
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:01,360
Rym: Watch your shit on YouTube.

641
00:31:01,841 --> 00:31:05,600
Rym: We're going to be a packed south doing bad games on Sunday in the Armadillo theater.

642
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:11,420
Rym: And otherwise, we're just going to be hanging out and south in and in barbecue and making fun of the south.

643
00:31:11,561 --> 00:31:15,000
Rym: And, you know, all the stuff we do at Pax is not getting shot by people in the south.

644
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:15,819
Rym: Yeah, hopefully.

645
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,073
Rym: Hopefully.

646
00:31:17,723 --> 00:31:19,259
Scott: What's the open carry laws at Pax?

647
00:31:20,342 --> 00:31:23,580
Rym: I'm pretty sure Pax is going to not allow open carry.

648
00:31:24,186 --> 00:31:24,878
Rym: We'll see what happens.

649
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,614
Scott: Can they or is it similar to the Anita talk?

650
00:31:29,343 --> 00:31:30,219
Rym: We're going to find out.

651
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:36,375
Rym: I mean, I will not walk out of our talk if people bring guns, but I see no one's going to shoot us.

652
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:41,200
Rym: But at the same time, I might not be able to resist commenting on that during the panel.

653
00:31:42,561 --> 00:31:43,260
Scott: Aaron Sealby.

654
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:43,838
Scott: There will be all right.

655
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,113
Scott: Yeah.

656
00:31:44,627 --> 00:31:45,180
Rym: I'm not afraid.

657
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,318
Scott: I hope he'll be there.

658
00:31:46,567 --> 00:31:46,675
Scott: Yeah.

659
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:47,618
Rym: I think he's going to be there.

660
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:47,978
Scott: All right.

661
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:48,680
Rym: Good.

662
00:31:49,131 --> 00:31:49,300
Rym: Yeah.

663
00:31:49,501 --> 00:31:50,998
Rym: So that's it.

664
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,140
Rym: Metastuff.

665
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:53,700
Rym: Subscribe to our newsletter.

666
00:31:54,061 --> 00:31:56,080
Scott: So actual episode.

667
00:31:56,983 --> 00:31:57,955
Scott: So we wanted to talk about A.I.

668
00:31:58,581 --> 00:32:01,560
Scott: I thought we had talked about it before, but I looked and I couldn't find an episode.

669
00:32:01,681 --> 00:32:04,960
Scott: So what I was even if we did talk about it before, it was ridiculously long time ago.

670
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:16,320
Rym: But we but yeah, but we actually don't know that much about A.I Now, we could like I was talking at length and Gigi from the forum because he actually is like it like he knows a shit ton about A.I.

671
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,544
Scott: He's studying A.I.

672
00:32:17,564 --> 00:32:21,322
Rym: in the school and he's explaining to me like current actual real A.I.

673
00:32:21,362 --> 00:32:24,359
Rym: stuff and maybe we'll do a show and I get him or someone on.

674
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,888
Scott: I only know the most basics of A.I.

675
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:29,758
Scott: as a programmer, but who doesn't do anything involving

676
00:32:29,778 --> 00:32:29,818
Scott: A.I.?

677
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:31,640
Scott: But you know what?

678
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,899
Scott: I do know a lot about completely fictional A.I It's all made up and shit like Skynet.

679
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:36,520
Scott: Yeah.

680
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,800
Scott: So let's just talk about that, because that's way more fun and easy.

681
00:32:39,982 --> 00:32:41,700
Scott: So we're told I can go home and eat because I'm hungry.

682
00:32:41,861 --> 00:32:43,268
Rym: So we're going to talk about A.I.

683
00:32:43,408 --> 00:32:49,020
Rym: under the assumptions of, you know, the Y plus 30 idea that, you know, 30 years from now, can't imagine shit.

684
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,636
Rym: Everything's bad.

685
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,554
Rym: Nothing's real.

686
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,417
Rym: I mean, imagine what the world was like 30 years.

687
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,279
Rym: A bad sci fi book.

688
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,478
Scott: You play gods.

689
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:02,872
Rym: And the reason I thought to do this topic was because fairly recently, Stephen Hawking was like, look, strong A.I.

690
00:33:02,893 --> 00:33:04,120
Rym: will fucking destroy us.

691
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,037
Rym: We should never make it.

692
00:33:05,302 --> 00:33:05,495
Scott: Maybe.

693
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:06,115
Rym: Yep.

694
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:12,234
Rym: That kind of sparked a debate among science types about what A.I.

695
00:33:12,635 --> 00:33:15,240
Rym: could and will do in a far future.

696
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:24,452
Rym: And also, you know, the book club book way back, Player of Games, the culture series kind of is based on the idea that humans make A.I.

697
00:33:24,492 --> 00:33:27,067
Rym: that's smarter than them and tell that A.I.

698
00:33:27,453 --> 00:33:27,879
Rym: go nuts.

699
00:33:28,482 --> 00:33:29,200
Rym: Do what thou wilt.

700
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,699
Rym: Let's see what fucking happens.

701
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,460
Rym: So, Scott, what do you think?

702
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,137
Rym: Like for real?

703
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,553
Rym: Do you think A.I.

704
00:33:35,594 --> 00:33:36,838
Rym: is going to be the thing that destroys us?

705
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:40,480
Rym: Just really like, you know, hundreds of years?

706
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:43,900
Scott: No, because I think the development, the timing is off, right?

707
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,319
Scott: It could be potentially the thing that destroys us.

708
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,331
Scott: But something else is more likely to happen.

709
00:33:49,411 --> 00:33:52,543
Scott: first, because it will take us so long to create an A.I.

710
00:33:52,603 --> 00:33:57,040
Scott: cable destroying us that there will be so many dangers in the meantime.

711
00:33:58,381 --> 00:34:04,468
Scott: The caldera will probably explode and cover the earth in dark haze before we develop an A.I.

712
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:05,258
Scott: that can kill us.

713
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:11,420
Rym: But well, on a counterpoint that we can't stop, because it's interesting that I've been saying this for a long time.

714
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:18,739
Rym: But John Green and Hank Green and like their big history show, they just made the same point in their life.

715
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:25,779
Rym: Basically, they argue that there is actually an overriding theme for the entire history of humans and the entire history of life.

716
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,694
Rym: And that that theme is rising.

717
00:34:29,755 --> 00:34:37,274
Rym: complexity is coming about as a result of and in the continuance of the increasingly efficient consumption of energy.

718
00:34:37,514 --> 00:34:39,407
Rym: to continue that rising complexity.

719
00:34:40,318 --> 00:34:40,520
Scott: Yes.

720
00:34:41,301 --> 00:34:42,585
Rym: So it's arguably.

721
00:34:42,726 --> 00:35:00,780
Rym: it's arguable and as I've been poking around, a lot of people way smarter than us have been arguing this point now that more has happened, more advancement of human technology in the last 30 to 50 years than in the previous entire history of humankind ever combined.

722
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,562
Scott: That is correct.

723
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:09,497
Rym: So if that is true, then the curve of technological acceleration is unfathomable.

724
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:10,502
Scott: Yes.

725
00:35:10,682 --> 00:35:14,299
Scott: So that assuming it doesn't stop like, you know, the speed of light stops you.

726
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:14,640
Rym: Yeah.

727
00:35:14,661 --> 00:35:18,423
Rym: Assuming we don't hit something, which interestingly, we have never hit to this point.

728
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:20,279
Scott: Well, Moore's law sort of stopped.

729
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,302
Rym: Yeah.

730
00:35:21,342 --> 00:35:25,340
Rym: But at the same time, processing capabilities have not really stopped.

731
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:31,517
Rym: Like we're able to process things way fast and we keep making more chips instead of making better ones.

732
00:35:31,821 --> 00:35:31,961
Rym: Yeah.

733
00:35:31,981 --> 00:35:38,920
Rym: We're like we're hitting this limit, like actually like modern CPUs tend to be slower than older CPUs in terms of instructions per second.

734
00:35:39,461 --> 00:35:54,309
Rym: But parallelism and all these other things that actually made them way better at doing the things we actually care about mostly except, you know, like in my day job, actually the things we do in old Pentium 4 is actually faster than modern Xeon chips for some things still.

735
00:35:54,329 --> 00:35:55,400
Scott: Depends what you're doing.

736
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:56,945
Rym: Yeah.

737
00:35:56,965 --> 00:36:00,258
Rym: But I don't think it's that far off.

738
00:36:00,298 --> 00:36:00,800
Rym: in our future.

739
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,480
Rym: I think like the 500 year span, we'll see A.I.s that are indistinguishable from humans.

740
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,302
Scott: Sure, maybe.

741
00:36:06,382 --> 00:36:10,940
Scott: But before 500 years, something else will happen that will kill us first.

742
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:14,677
Rym: When we were like still led, addled and dumb in the 60s.

743
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:23,920
Scott: Killed by something else by that time, then that will almost definitely be the thing in a world where it will definitely not be the thing in a world before the Internet.

744
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,459
Scott: If nothing else kills us or that resilient, A.I.

745
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,504
Scott: won't kill us either.

746
00:36:27,705 --> 00:36:39,900
Rym: Before the Internet and before we got all that lead on the atmosphere that was pretty literally making us stupid and violent, we had nuclear weapons capable of ending all human life and somehow we didn't fucking use them.

747
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,760
Scott: We still have them and they still might be used.

748
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,524
Scott: Don't hold your breath.

749
00:36:42,564 --> 00:36:45,202
Rym: I think the chance of us using them has gone down over time, not up.

750
00:36:45,444 --> 00:36:47,499
Scott: Yes, but don't count it out.

751
00:36:48,183 --> 00:36:49,698
Scott: Do not count that shit out.

752
00:36:50,461 --> 00:36:50,642
Rym: All right.

753
00:36:50,662 --> 00:36:55,540
Rym: So so let's assume then that at some point we don't get destroyed and A.I.

754
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,642
Rym: gets made.

755
00:36:56,662 --> 00:37:01,679
Rym: That is well, I guess already we have to talk about like an A.I.

756
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,397
Rym: that is like us or an A.I.

757
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,740
Rym: that is unfathomable to us because they're really two different roads.

758
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,464
Scott: I mean, an A.I.

759
00:37:07,504 --> 00:37:10,100
Scott: that is like us is not really something to be afraid of.

760
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,104
Scott: It's just fucking awesome.

761
00:37:11,366 --> 00:37:14,905
Rym: Yeah, except it might just also be an asshole and just kill us because it's right.

762
00:37:14,925 --> 00:37:16,940
Scott: But it couldn't kill us all because it's like us.

763
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,759
Scott: It's on our level so we could kill it, too.

764
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,598
Rym: But what if it's like us in the sense that it has, you know, humans not.

765
00:37:24,638 --> 00:37:30,341
Rym: I don't want to get into the whole like predestination, you know, all those arguments about free will or whatever.

766
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:51,478
Rym: But if it's like us in the sense that we appear to have sensory input output into the world in terms of we can physically do shit and we have a consciousness, even if we don't have free will, in the sense that our actions are sort of this feedback loop of we get stimuli, we run it through our collective memories, we appear to have cognition, then we make decisions.

767
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,545
Rym: So what if A.I.

768
00:37:53,565 --> 00:37:57,420
Rym: is like that in the sense that it is as conscious as humans are?

769
00:37:57,983 --> 00:37:58,547
Scott: I mean, sure.

770
00:37:58,567 --> 00:37:59,937
Scott: It could be an evil A.I.

771
00:38:00,461 --> 00:38:02,459
Scott: like the first Terminator or some shit.

772
00:38:02,883 --> 00:38:04,179
Rym: I don't think the first Terminator A.I.

773
00:38:04,321 --> 00:38:04,724
Rym: was evil.

774
00:38:05,428 --> 00:38:07,080
Scott: All right, Skynet, fine.

775
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,842
Scott: It could be evil.

776
00:38:08,163 --> 00:38:14,088
Rym: Very clearly, Skynet reacted to us trying to kill it and defend it itself.

777
00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:14,900
Rym: It wasn't evil.

778
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:19,900
Rym: It was just at best uncaring and unsympathetic to the person who tried to murder it.

779
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,758
Scott: The guy in the first Alien movie then.

780
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,354
Rym: But that A.I.

781
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,060
Rym: was programmed to do what it did, just pretend it's something like an evil biaroid guy.

782
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,144
Rym: I'm not even saying evil.

783
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:34,358
Rym: I'm just saying if it's if it's like us in the sense that it is A.I.

784
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:41,622
Rym: that is conscious in a way recognizable to humans as conscious, as in it passes the Turing test.

785
00:38:41,943 --> 00:38:45,759
Rym: And if I talk to it, it is indistinguishable from a human to me.

786
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,070
Scott: Then it's just a new person.

787
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,280
Scott: It's no different than making a baby.

788
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,082
Rym: Exactly.

789
00:38:49,262 --> 00:38:55,019
Rym: However, what if because it's built with technology, it's slightly smarter than any human on Earth?

790
00:38:55,864 --> 00:38:56,514
Scott: Only slightly?

791
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:56,615
Scott: Yeah.

792
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,913
Scott: Then it's not like us.

793
00:38:57,974 --> 00:38:58,360
Scott: It's better.

794
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,098
Rym: It's like us.

795
00:39:00,622 --> 00:39:01,920
Scott: It's no, like us means like us.

796
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,339
Scott: You want to talk about something better than us?

797
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,440
Scott: Let's talk about something better than us.

798
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:09,760
Rym: Scott, if you're going to use like in that ridiculously pedantic fashion, I don't know how we're going to have this discussion.

799
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,388
Scott: It's I mean, if you want to talk about

800
00:39:11,488 --> 00:39:11,770
Scott: A.I.,

801
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,600
Scott: I mean, you're talking about degrees here.

802
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:18,365
Rym: But it's like literally point one percent smarter than that's not enough to make a goddamn difference.

803
00:39:19,213 --> 00:39:19,717
Rym: I think it is.

804
00:39:20,242 --> 00:39:22,140
Scott: How could that point one percent make any difference?

805
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,980
Scott: Well, because all right, let's say it's exactly one percent smarter than you.

806
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,465
Scott: What's the difference?

807
00:39:27,309 --> 00:39:30,340
Rym: Have you gotten a standardized IQ test in your life?

808
00:39:30,682 --> 00:39:32,499
Scott: I think we all know what's going on here.

809
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,503
Rym: Have you gotten this?

810
00:39:33,844 --> 00:39:39,104
Rym: I'm accredited by the state of Michigan if we're talking about intelligence credentials.

811
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:40,359
Rym: Pretty defensive over there.

812
00:39:41,281 --> 00:39:42,799
Rym: So let's say fine, Scott.

813
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:46,960
Rym: It is as intelligent as the smartest human who has ever lived.

814
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:47,702
Scott: That is just.

815
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:56,100
Rym: it's as if we had another person who was smart, except for a couple of things, because it's a it's a computer program, it's immortal.

816
00:39:57,483 --> 00:40:00,300
Rym: And it has and it can store more data than we can store.

817
00:40:00,721 --> 00:40:08,319
Rym: So now so now it's not just as smart as us, except it can augment itself to be infinitely better forever and nothing can stop.

818
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,459
Scott: Also, it's questionable whether it can actually store more data or not.

819
00:40:12,561 --> 00:40:13,224
Rym: Well, yeah.

820
00:40:13,465 --> 00:40:16,420
Scott: How much data would my memories take up if we filled up hard drives?

821
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:18,780
Rym: But how much of that is just bullshit heuristics?

822
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,099
Rym: How much do we actually remember?

823
00:40:20,802 --> 00:40:28,960
Scott: Well, I mean, there's how much there's how much I can bring to mind at any given moment, but how much I could theoretically bring to mind given infinite time to remember things.

824
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:34,120
Rym: We think we know as about how much we actually know, like I know songs, right?

825
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,139
Rym: Like I there are songs that I know in my head.

826
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:45,040
Rym: But how much of that is me actually knowing the fullness of the song versus some bullshit heuristic and like remembering some of the lyrics and figuring out the rest?

827
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,438
Scott: You get a lot of compression going on.

828
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,145
Rym: Exactly.

829
00:40:47,267 --> 00:40:48,580
Rym: Super lossy compression.

830
00:40:50,702 --> 00:40:53,640
Rym: So should we just go to a higher level then of this discussion?

831
00:40:54,582 --> 00:40:55,064
Rym: What if the A.I.

832
00:40:55,105 --> 00:40:56,191
Rym: is like the culture A.I.

833
00:40:56,392 --> 00:40:57,437
Scott: is like the culture

834
00:40:57,498 --> 00:40:57,538
Scott: A.I.?

835
00:40:58,001 --> 00:40:59,420
Rym: That's the best possible scenario.

836
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,001
Scott: OK.

837
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:02,320
Scott: Well, I mean, if it's exactly like it, then, yeah, it's awesome.

838
00:41:02,841 --> 00:41:07,440
Scott: But just assuming it's on the same power level, but not necessarily of the same nature.

839
00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:08,603
Scott: Yeah.

840
00:41:08,623 --> 00:41:19,660
Scott: Then the thing we had to be concerned with is not necessarily that it will be, quote, evil and kill us all, but that much in the way we look on ants, it will look on us as some lesser being.

841
00:41:20,123 --> 00:41:22,199
Scott: And it's like we don't go and kill all the ants.

842
00:41:22,722 --> 00:41:25,500
Scott: But if ants infest our house, we exterminate them.

843
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,820
Scott: And so if they are underfoot, we may trot upon them without even thinking or caring.

844
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:36,259
Rym: There's actually a super relevant YouTube video I'll find and link you to that shows if the A.I.

845
00:41:36,741 --> 00:41:42,437
Rym: are like us in any way and we are to them like ants are to us, we are fucked.

846
00:41:42,758 --> 00:41:48,120
Scott: because this video The thing is, millions and millions of ants live all over Earth without any getting killed by us.

847
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:48,441
Scott: Yes.

848
00:41:48,521 --> 00:41:48,965
Scott: And you know what?

849
00:41:48,986 --> 00:41:50,520
Scott: Some of them get eaten by anteaters, though.

850
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,780
Rym: But this video is so very humans.

851
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,059
Rym: And apparently this is a commonly done thing.

852
00:41:55,483 --> 00:41:57,600
Rym: And you know what they do for art?

853
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:03,400
Rym: They will go out and find the biggest ant colony they can find, just like in the backyard or out in the woods or metal into it.

854
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:03,720
Scott: Yeah.

855
00:42:03,761 --> 00:42:10,060
Rym: And they'll pour molten aluminum into it, killing all the ants because it makes a cool thing that you can then dig out.

856
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:10,382
Rym: Yep.

857
00:42:11,397 --> 00:42:11,620
Rym: Yeah.

858
00:42:11,701 --> 00:42:12,104
Rym: So the

859
00:42:12,285 --> 00:42:12,406
Rym: A.I.,

860
00:42:12,466 --> 00:42:14,159
Rym: if it's like us at all, would do that to us.

861
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:14,583
Scott: Right.

862
00:42:14,644 --> 00:42:15,720
Scott: But there's just so many people.

863
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:20,540
Scott: It would do that to some people's like it would go to your town and turn your town into a frozen work of art.

864
00:42:21,162 --> 00:42:22,879
Scott: And then some other town is going to be just fun.

865
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:24,960
Scott: You know, it'd be like Attack on Titan.

866
00:42:25,341 --> 00:42:26,979
Scott: It's like maybe the Titans just won't come to your town.

867
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:27,662
Scott: Yeah.

868
00:42:27,683 --> 00:42:27,825
Scott: Yeah.

869
00:42:28,293 --> 00:42:28,619
Rym: Whatevs.

870
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,280
Scott: And most, you know, there's tons of ants.

871
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:34,339
Scott: Most ants are not killed by people, only many.

872
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,119
Rym: So there are so many ants.

873
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:55,012
Rym: The only reason the A.I.s don't do things like that is because for whatever reasons, not to get into all the like literature details of like those books, is that they have, for whatever reason, a sense of their own morality, though they recognize that it's entirely arbitrary and they seem the

874
00:42:55,052 --> 00:42:57,200
Scott: same that humans have their own morality.

875
00:42:57,461 --> 00:42:57,705
Scott: Exactly.

876
00:42:57,746 --> 00:42:58,580
Scott: It's completely arbitrary.

877
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,143
Rym: Exactly.

878
00:42:59,627 --> 00:43:01,040
Rym: And they have a sense of humor.

879
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:06,220
Rym: And I get the impression they feel kind of sorry for us because we're so dumb.

880
00:43:07,264 --> 00:43:07,549
Scott: Maybe.

881
00:43:08,016 --> 00:43:08,219
Rym: Yeah.

882
00:43:08,501 --> 00:43:13,340
Scott: I mean, there are some people who try not to kill ants because, you know, and they're much higher life forms than the ants.

883
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,345
Rym: No, that is true.

884
00:43:14,546 --> 00:43:16,539
Scott: They just don't like hurting little antes because they're cute.

885
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:18,720
Scott: But except the fire ants and the crazy ants.

886
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,226
Scott: Fuck them.

887
00:43:19,774 --> 00:43:20,119
Rym: I think.

888
00:43:20,361 --> 00:43:22,600
Scott: Fuck you, fire ants and crazy ants, I think.

889
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,919
Scott: And then some people who take the fire ants, the crazy ants, put them together and see who wins.

890
00:43:27,463 --> 00:43:29,819
Rym: I think on the broadest boilers, the crazy ants.

891
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:44,740
Rym: I don't think A.I.s will openly, literally destroy us if they're those kinds of A.I.s, because it's not going to be Skynet where they kill us all, because I don't think we will ever be stupid enough to give the A.I.s control of the physical things.

892
00:43:45,502 --> 00:43:45,847
Scott: Sure.

893
00:43:45,928 --> 00:43:46,659
Scott: That's another thing.

894
00:43:46,883 --> 00:43:47,148
Rym: Yes.

895
00:43:47,188 --> 00:43:47,820
Rym: Like, yes.

896
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,386
Rym: Oh, no.

897
00:43:48,691 --> 00:43:48,955
Rym: The A.I.

898
00:43:49,561 --> 00:43:56,100
Rym: is a billion times smarter than any human and it controls the auto manufacturing facility that we just turn the power off.

899
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:03,660
Scott: But I mean, if it just you know, the problem is, is at least our current real world, like I can just connect to the power plant and fuck it up.

900
00:44:03,942 --> 00:44:05,500
Scott: It's this stuff is way insecure.

901
00:44:05,742 --> 00:44:08,020
Rym: Well, but at least the nukes and it's on the Internet.

902
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,409
Rym: The nukes are not on the Internet.

903
00:44:09,449 --> 00:44:10,960
Rym: The nukes use like 12 inch floppies.

904
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:11,707
Scott: I hope so.

905
00:44:11,951 --> 00:44:12,357
Scott: They do.

906
00:44:13,242 --> 00:44:15,620
Scott: But yeah, the shit is like connected to the Internet.

907
00:44:15,762 --> 00:44:16,917
Scott: So if the A.I.

908
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:22,900
Scott: gets on the Internet, which it probably will, at least the current modern day Internet, it can fuck a lot of shit up like the bank.

909
00:44:23,662 --> 00:44:24,387
Rym: You know what would happen?

910
00:44:24,407 --> 00:44:26,380
Rym: It would be exactly like summer wars, actually.

911
00:44:26,661 --> 00:44:27,919
Scott: Yeah, a lot like summer wars.

912
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:28,321
Rym: Yeah.

913
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:29,004
Rym: Is that like?

914
00:44:29,024 --> 00:44:30,150
Rym: look, it couldn't like.

915
00:44:30,633 --> 00:44:31,739
Rym: it had all the that A.I.

916
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,436
Rym: had basically all the powers that an A.I.

917
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,180
Rym: that was somehow loose on the Internet's combined could like it.

918
00:44:37,701 --> 00:44:42,180
Scott: But in the regular everyday world, everyone is just fine except for their digital lives.

919
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,060
Rym: Well, except like it could mess with hospitals to kill people and like that aspect.

920
00:44:46,521 --> 00:44:46,602
Scott: Yeah.

921
00:44:47,026 --> 00:44:47,248
Scott: Yeah.

922
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:48,600
Scott: Don't put your hospital on the Internet.

923
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,121
Rym: Yeah.

924
00:44:49,141 --> 00:44:49,442
Rym: We should.

925
00:44:49,502 --> 00:44:50,927
Scott: we should make a special like.

926
00:44:51,509 --> 00:44:54,820
Scott: we should go build a hospital that has good Internet's like.

927
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,459
Rym: Scott, I worked for a hospital Internet's.

928
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,780
Rym: That is literally impossible.

929
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,479
Scott: Let's make a brand new hospital and everything set up and it's super nice.

930
00:45:02,861 --> 00:45:03,102
Scott: Yeah.

931
00:45:03,464 --> 00:45:06,140
Scott: And then, you know, make a brand new power plant where it's not on the Internet.

932
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,420
Rym: But I don't I don't think that scenario is going to happen.

933
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:23,040
Rym: But I am pretty convinced that what will happen is that eventually artificial intelligence is created by us, will replace us in the sense that those are the technology we make will be the only things that could ever get off this planet and go anywhere else.

934
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:23,681
Scott: That's true.

935
00:45:24,022 --> 00:45:33,560
Rym: So we'll be destroyed by them in the same way that the beings that became homo sapiens were destroyed by homo sapiens.

936
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:43,716
Scott: But another thing, if we have a technology that we can send on this voyage, we can also send frozen people bits like in some eggs and you know what we will also and it could create.

937
00:45:43,776 --> 00:45:46,280
Scott: it could be programmed to create people when it gets there.

938
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,200
Rym: And I think we'll recognize that the eyes are literally in every way superior and won't bother.

939
00:45:51,901 --> 00:45:52,768
Scott: Maybe they won't bother.

940
00:45:52,808 --> 00:45:54,420
Scott: Maybe they will, because it's an experiment.

941
00:45:54,541 --> 00:45:58,960
Scott: Like you might bring some ants or a monkey with you in space if you went to the moon or something.

942
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:06,339
Rym: But I think in the long run that now the question really to me, for me, to me, from me will be, will that kind of A.I.

943
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:22,420
Rym: arise because we created artificially or because we take humans and their consciousnesses and augment or re implement them on better substrates and then continue evolving purely from a mimetic, cultural, technological standpoint and just leave biology behind.

944
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,440
Scott: So are you talking about like a ship of Theseus person where you make a brand new person?

945
00:46:27,181 --> 00:46:28,980
Scott: Or are you talking about a ghost in the shell?

946
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,799
Scott: Someone uploads their brain to the Internet.

947
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:31,482
Rym: I think it's.

948
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:36,120
Rym: I think the ship of Theseus is the most likely scenario to create the first conscious A.I.

949
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:39,240
Rym: And I think that thing will go on to replace humans.

950
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:44,100
Scott: We should name it Theseus and we should be the ones who make it so that we get to name it Theseus.

951
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:44,561
Rym: Yeah.

952
00:46:44,762 --> 00:46:47,580
Rym: The thing is, I want to make it with me and we should put it on a boat.

953
00:46:47,842 --> 00:46:48,697
Rym: I want it to be me.

954
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:51,360
Rym: I want my brain to be the first ship of Theseus.

955
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:52,730
Scott: Well, you should have studied A.I.

956
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:54,240
Scott: and stopped working in finance too late.

957
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,680
Rym: No, someone else has to figure all that shit out because young people have to figure it out.

958
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,820
Rym: And when I'm like 80 or 90, I need you to ship a Theseus of me before I go senile and die.

959
00:47:02,684 --> 00:47:03,319
Scott: I'm sorry, bro.

960
00:47:03,623 --> 00:47:04,297
Scott: It's not going to be you.

961
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,142
Rym: There's a chance.

962
00:47:05,262 --> 00:47:10,080
Rym: The thing is, we're the first generation in history where the chance isn't literally zero.

963
00:47:10,462 --> 00:47:12,078
Rym: It's like point one.

964
00:47:13,102 --> 00:47:16,399
Rym: But the fact that it's literally not zero, it's not going to be you.

965
00:47:16,844 --> 00:47:17,659
Scott: For you, it's zero.

966
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,080
Scott: For me, it's point.

967
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:25,480
Rym: Listen, rich, scary benefactor who listens to GeekNights from his secret satellite.

968
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,699
Scott: They're choosing them first.

969
00:47:27,521 --> 00:47:27,662
Rym: Yeah.

970
00:47:27,722 --> 00:47:30,279
Rym: If your brain doesn't make it like, yo, dog, you've listened to me.

971
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,880
Rym: You you're with me, right?

972
00:47:32,323 --> 00:47:33,457
Rym: If it can't be you, why not me?

973
00:47:34,361 --> 00:47:36,718
Scott: Because there's 10 million people are better than you.

974
00:47:37,723 --> 00:47:38,978
Rym: Name one Theseus.

975
00:47:39,662 --> 00:47:40,345
Rym: He actually.

976
00:47:41,089 --> 00:47:42,718
Rym: Theseus didn't work out so well.

977
00:47:43,641 --> 00:47:45,000
Rym: Listen, Scott, do you remember?

978
00:47:45,441 --> 00:47:45,898
Scott: Agamemnon then.

979
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,086
Rym: Agamemnon.

980
00:47:47,127 --> 00:47:47,511
Rym: Yeah.

981
00:47:47,895 --> 00:47:48,300
Rym: Agamemnon.

982
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,250
Rym: Of course, he was kind of a dick, but he deserves.

983
00:47:50,733 --> 00:47:52,100
Rym: he was more of a dick than I am.

984
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:52,978
Rym: I will give him that.

985
00:47:53,481 --> 00:47:55,778
Scott: Then that's why he's going to cut you in front of you in life.

986
00:47:57,442 --> 00:47:59,559
Scott: I'll just get and you're not going to do shit about it.

987
00:48:01,486 --> 00:48:02,017
Rym: You know what I'll do?

988
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:05,080
Rym: Yo, Poseidon, look, you're awesome.

989
00:48:05,904 --> 00:48:06,658
Rym: Not denying that.

990
00:48:06,962 --> 00:48:07,740
Rym: So can you help me out?

991
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,399
Scott: Besides, it's like, well, are you trying to become gods down there?

992
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,324
Scott: Drown you all.

993
00:48:13,216 --> 00:48:13,880
Scott: I can't have that.

994
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:14,656
Scott: I can't have this.

995
00:48:14,921 --> 00:48:16,300
Rym: No, me hubris.

996
00:48:17,283 --> 00:48:19,139
Scott: No, can't be having this action.

997
00:48:23,185 --> 00:48:23,447
Scott: All right.

998
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:23,972
Rym: Yeah.

999
00:48:23,992 --> 00:48:24,980
Scott: Is there anything else to say?

1000
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:25,616
Scott: I can eat dinner now.

1001
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,880
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1002
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:39,020
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1003
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:44,419
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row crew dot com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1004
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,360
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1005
00:48:47,501 --> 00:48:52,079
Rym: Sci tech Mondays, gaming Tuesdays and comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

1006
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,443
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a creative commons attribution 3.0 license.

1007
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:59,940
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1008
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,040
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
