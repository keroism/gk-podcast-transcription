1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,089
Rym: It's Wednesday December 26th.

2
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:12,972
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,072 --> 00:00:15,238
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:20,520
Rym: tonight We finally get around to reviewing Batman the Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller.

5
00:00:23,722 --> 00:00:29,859
Rym: Let's do this So anyone who's known us for any amount of time knows that?

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:45,013
Rym: One of our favorite things to do especially back when we were in college was uh go to the video barn get some random possibly violent possibly involving Yakuza or swords or something Asian movie and watch it well.

7
00:00:45,033 --> 00:01:01,860
Scott: that trend began because at Otakon many years ago we watched each of the killer which was a. it's a movie directed by Takashi Mika who is Sort of famous director from Japan and he makes many violent movies, but also some other not violent movies.

8
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,278
Scott: He makes all kinds of stuff, but mostly he's known for his violent Yakuza stuff And the theme did a lot of TV.

9
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:19,207
Scott: but the first three movies he did were like the black society trilogy with through these three Yakuza movies or Yakuza related movies and They all were there.

10
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:21,797
Scott: They're not like other mob crime movies.

11
00:01:21,857 --> 00:01:25,049
Scott: They're much more Terrible in the.

12
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,840
Scott: you know what happens on screen.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,292
Scott: But in some ways it seems more like that's the way it really is in the mob as opposed to like the glorified way The mob is insane.

14
00:01:34,454 --> 00:01:38,558
Rym: That's one thing I mean when we watched rainy dog, which I think is my favorite work of his.

15
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:41,369
Scott: actually It's the second in this black society trilogy.

16
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:51,180
Rym: It was very and he even talked about this in the When they talk like his biography that he likes to have action scenes separate from violence.

17
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,888
Scott: So it's like in an American movie violence.

18
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:57,580
Scott: There's a lot of violence, but violence is always part of action.

19
00:01:57,681 --> 00:02:03,190
Scott: It's like you watch the matrix is violence in the matrix But the violence is part of an action scene.

20
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,371
Scott: it's.

21
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:06,260
Scott: it's like, you know punching and kicking and shooting violence.

22
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,607
Rym: So there's always this element of glorification.

23
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:12,840
Rym: Mm-hmm in his movies when violent things happen.

24
00:02:13,181 --> 00:02:14,645
Rym: It's never in an action scene.

25
00:02:14,665 --> 00:02:19,880
Scott: It's all sometimes this, you know guys beating each other up, but even then it's not an action scene.

26
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,310
Rym: It's not like some cool choreographed fight.

27
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:24,660
Scott: Yeah, it's not shot as an action scene.

28
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:34,240
Scott: For example, they'll have a scene where just the cameras pointed at the ground and a guy's getting like beat up with pipes And it's not like, you know cutting and moving around like it would in an action shot.

29
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:44,785
Rym: There was actually a really good scene in the movie We're about to talk about more deeply as a geek bite where they're in this like mafia kind of Yakuza Triad hangout place.

30
00:02:44,845 --> 00:02:47,073
Rym: It's like their club and there's kickboxing there.

31
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,860
Rym: So they keep every time they go back there.

32
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:54,160
Rym: There's kickboxers doing choreographed fights in the background and practicing and it's like an action scene there all the time.

33
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,125
Rym: Just these kickboxers.

34
00:02:55,808 --> 00:03:13,700
Rym: and then there's a scene where a real brutal actual fight breaks out while the kickboxers are practicing and you definitely see the contrast between The so-called Hollywood action scene and what a real fight is like because real fights are down and dirty and generally suck for everyone involved.

35
00:03:14,101 --> 00:03:20,740
Rym: Yep, but I liked rainy dog and I liked each of the killer, but I liked it for purely ironic reasons.

36
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:32,565
Scott: But this the movie the first movie in the Black Society trilogy Which we just watched yesterday called Shinjuku Triad Society or Shinjuku Kuroshikai Chinese mafia Senso.

37
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:37,740
Scott: Yeah, not I mean it was his first full-length movie ever.

38
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,125
Scott: So I'll give him a break.

39
00:03:39,246 --> 00:03:40,772
Rym: but he was trying hard.

40
00:03:40,832 --> 00:03:42,800
Rym: There was a lot of symbolism in this movie.

41
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:47,759
Scott: Yeah, I mean you could tell he was trying hard and you could tell that there was something going on.

42
00:03:48,263 --> 00:03:49,452
Scott: But it just he wasn't.

43
00:03:49,472 --> 00:03:50,400
Scott: it wasn't working for him.

44
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,545
Rym: I guess what got to me was that I didn't give one shit about what any and what happened to any character in this whole Stupid movie.

45
00:03:57,605 --> 00:04:02,833
Scott: I do think that is the number one problem with the movie Is that I really just didn't like or care about anyone.

46
00:04:02,874 --> 00:04:04,360
Scott: I couldn't sympathize with anyone.

47
00:04:04,461 --> 00:04:06,800
Scott: I mean, I guess I hated a few characters, but that was about it.

48
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:16,399
Rym: I mean granted I could see that maybe that's what he was going for that This is a world this, you know, seedy crime infested world where there are no sympathetic figures.

49
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:26,380
Rym: Everyone's an idiot and horrible, but I felt like I was supposed to like the main character Because he wasn't so bad, but see the movie was okay, and he was trying hard.

50
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,126
Rym: There's like there's a lot there from a cinema.

51
00:04:28,206 --> 00:04:35,709
Rym: I mean if you want to study film or like Japanese Asian film or Takashi Mika's film you have to watch this movie.

52
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:41,429
Rym: It's an academic exercise, but it's not the most Enjoyable movie to watch.

53
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:44,143
Rym: there are two reasons for that Reason.

54
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:52,257
Rym: the first is that there was only one female character basically and She's a gecky guy girl in the classic most horrible sense.

55
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,720
Rym: I It I really didn't like that character and I really didn't like where they went with that character.

56
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,885
Scott: I didn't like it at all.

57
00:04:59,187 --> 00:05:01,698
Scott: I like she was in like the opening scene of the movie.

58
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:06,776
Scott: for a second I thought I was never gonna see her again, but then we saw her again and I was like, ah Why do we have to see her again?

59
00:05:07,483 --> 00:05:12,286
Rym: Go away and then the way she comes back into the plot is just so horrible and Misogynistic.

60
00:05:12,347 --> 00:05:20,544
Rym: and while that's probably the point I just it was it was cringe-worthy, but I think the number one thing that made me not like this movie There's another female character.

61
00:05:20,764 --> 00:05:22,309
Rym: Oh, yeah, the grandma right exactly.

62
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,005
Rym: I'm pretty sure is the grandma from Kamikaze girls.

63
00:05:27,085 --> 00:05:29,153
Scott: I'm a hundred percent sure cuz no wait.

64
00:05:29,213 --> 00:05:31,040
Scott: No, there was a third female character.

65
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:34,449
Scott: Oh, yeah, grandma isn't the grandma from kamikaze girls.

66
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:38,620
Scott: the the whorehouse mom the mafia lady the mafia lady.

67
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:41,108
Scott: She is the grandma from kamikaze girls.

68
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:44,620
Scott: Yes, there were three three female characters two old ladies in one young lady.

69
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:53,729
Rym: I'll assume that she is in fact that the kamikaze girls universe is the same universe as Takashi mike's world and that that grandma Went on to be the grandma in kamikaze girl.

70
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:54,613
Scott: It's a safe assumption.

71
00:05:55,114 --> 00:06:00,957
Rym: Yes, cuz the eye pageant everything Yep, but you know, I wonder if that was well anyway, that might have been slightly on purpose.

72
00:06:00,977 --> 00:06:01,479
Rym: You never know.

73
00:06:02,381 --> 00:06:06,040
Rym: The director might have been like hey a nod or maybe we're just reading a lot into that.

74
00:06:06,943 --> 00:06:19,356
Rym: The number one reason why I did not enjoy this movie was that there is an allowed amount of Forced sodomy that can be in a movie where I can still enjoy the movie.

75
00:06:19,817 --> 00:06:26,340
Rym: this movie Met that threshold in like 10 minutes and there was another hour and a half to go.

76
00:06:26,521 --> 00:06:28,029
Rym: So I knew this was downhill.

77
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,195
Scott: it granted stuff.

78
00:06:29,577 --> 00:06:33,880
Scott: granted though It only had like one or two more for sodomies after across the line.

79
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,400
Rym: So that was way too many forcible sodomies.

80
00:06:36,845 --> 00:06:42,200
Scott: But it was I. you know There were way too many for sodomies and it was horrible and painful to watch.

81
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,420
Rym: I think that why it was top heavy.

82
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,573
Scott: They were all close to the beginning of the movie.

83
00:06:46,593 --> 00:06:48,964
Scott: in this and later in the movie They were not really any.

84
00:06:48,984 --> 00:06:52,616
Rym: it's I guess to its credit if you start watching this movie in 15 minutes in your.

85
00:06:53,017 --> 00:07:05,239
Rym: if you try To project the amount of male on male or male on female for sodomy in this movie based on the first 20 minutes Be relieved that the number drops precipitously after that.

86
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:11,018
Rym: Yep, however that one short judo guy who reminds me a little bit apart.

87
00:07:11,158 --> 00:07:13,106
Rym: Oh, yeah What the fuck was up with that?

88
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:15,014
Scott: Oh, that was like the worst thing ever.

89
00:07:15,155 --> 00:07:16,320
Rym: That didn't make any sense.

90
00:07:16,621 --> 00:07:18,125
Rym: Why did that guy rape that guy?

91
00:07:18,346 --> 00:07:18,847
Rym: Why was he?

92
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:20,713
Scott: that's totally something out of a cosmo.

93
00:07:20,813 --> 00:07:21,275
Scott: Okay.

94
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:22,438
Rym: I know there's no.

95
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:27,160
Rym: also It's scary, but that guy really reminded me of teller from Penn and Teller.

96
00:07:27,682 --> 00:07:31,860
Scott: He reminded me of the nerdy guy in sanctuary the short Ross Perot looking guy.

97
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:39,211
Rym: Maybe he's like a mixture of the two because he had the same he didn't really talk at all And he had the exact same facial expressions that teller has.

98
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:44,139
Rym: so I assume that if teller ever raped some guy That is exactly what it would look like.

99
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,549
Scott: Anyway that movie.

100
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:53,260
Rym: and now yeah I will point out too that I'm pretty sure every single character in this movie was homosexual.

101
00:07:53,842 --> 00:08:03,219
Scott: Yeah, but the the only thing I'd say about the DVD is the best thing about this DVD was on the DVD There was a Takashi Miike biography and I actually didn't know much about the guy.

102
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:16,840
Scott: But reading that biography really opened my eyes and I suggest everyone go read the Wikipedia About Takashi Miike even if you never go and see any of his movies just to learn about him because it's quite interesting.

103
00:08:17,782 --> 00:08:31,940
Rym: So if you want to see Takashi Miike's works I'd recommend you watch rainy dog and maybe ley lines, which I haven't seen yet, but Don't watch Shinjuku Kuroshikai unless you are really scraping the bottom of the movie barrel.

104
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,649
Scott: Yeah, there's plenty of other movies.

105
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:35,990
Scott: He's made.

106
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,899
Scott: He's made a lot of things that you can go and say wow a lot.

107
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,765
Scott: I'm looking at the list right now.

108
00:08:41,008 --> 00:08:41,289
Rym: Yeah.

109
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:41,851
Rym: All right.

110
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:47,200
Rym: Anyway, so in a much more interesting news This is real brief and then I'll let Scott go because I don't have much to say about this.

111
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:48,840
Scott: But I don't have much to say about mine either.

112
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:54,379
Rym: You know those Death Note movies and the Death Note anime the Death Note live-action or the anime or the all of them.

113
00:08:55,523 --> 00:09:04,720
Rym: In the live-actions, they uh, they filmed a whole bunch of scenes Involving Matsuda who's perhaps my favorite character other than Elle.

114
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,214
Scott: Matsuda's tough because like Matsuda is like he's that guy.

115
00:09:10,274 --> 00:09:11,177
Scott: It's like you can do it.

116
00:09:11,238 --> 00:09:17,582
Scott: Come on You can do it and it's like he's the guy with the will and the drive But not the brains.

117
00:09:17,782 --> 00:09:20,906
Scott: and there's other guys are the brains but not the will of the drive.

118
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:22,969
Rym: Matsuda is all guts.

119
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:27,218
Rym: Yep, and Basically, they cut all his scenes out of the movie.

120
00:09:28,691 --> 00:09:39,760
Rym: So to make up for that all those scenes are gonna be put together with additional things They shot later to make a new movie the that's tentatively called spin-off Matsuda.

121
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:43,710
Rym: It's gonna be a television special all Matsuda all the way.

122
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:47,340
Rym: Oh god, I think I'm gonna seek that out.

123
00:09:47,862 --> 00:09:48,606
Scott: It's all you.

124
00:09:48,627 --> 00:09:50,015
Rym: it could be fun.

125
00:09:50,035 --> 00:10:02,640
Rym: I My feeling my guess is that it will have the same kind of feeling watching it that Bayside shakedown head just kind of silly cop doing his cop thing full of guts and not many brains.

126
00:10:02,942 --> 00:10:04,413
Scott: It's all you granted.

127
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:10,224
Rym: It won't have that song Don't Alright?

128
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:14,500
Scott: so speaking of new things in Japan, whatever, you know Macross, right?

129
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:18,148
Scott: Yeah, I know Macross is real old.

130
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,354
Scott: It's 25 years old.

131
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,160
Rym: Hey, that's as old as me.

132
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:23,117
Scott: It's as old as me.

133
00:10:23,741 --> 00:10:30,669
Scott: We're as old as Macross and I guess that's maybe that's part of why I like Macross so much because it's I've grown up With it sort of exactly.

134
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:32,077
Rym: Are you sure it's not just Lin min?

135
00:10:32,117 --> 00:10:34,920
Scott: May I Back let Min May's the least favorite.

136
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:41,320
Scott: Anyway to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Macross all about captain global.

137
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:46,680
Scott: Yeah, they they've been making this new series Macross frontier.

138
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:52,474
Scott: It's a direct sequel to Macross 7, which I haven't seen but that doesn't matter.

139
00:10:52,655 --> 00:10:54,700
Rym: I've heard okay things about it.

140
00:10:56,423 --> 00:11:02,886
Scott: I think I saw an episode of it and I'm not too about to go and watch it but The first episode is out.

141
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:04,290
Scott: It's also on the bit torrents.

142
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,075
Scott: So I don't know.

143
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:09,466
Scott: I really think that I Don't know if you should watch this.

144
00:11:09,566 --> 00:11:10,411
Scott: I haven't watched it yet.

145
00:11:10,431 --> 00:11:18,788
Scott: So I can't say if it's good or bad but Let me just use this as an opportunity to tell you to go and watch the original Macross TV series.

146
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:20,599
Scott: you can probably get it for really cheap now.

147
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:24,500
Scott: The whole thing is on DVD in the US and they're high quality DVDs.

148
00:11:24,722 --> 00:11:25,185
Scott: I bought the.

149
00:11:25,306 --> 00:11:30,640
Scott: I pre-ordered and bought the box set Originally came out for a shitload of money when I was in college and I was poor.

150
00:11:31,102 --> 00:11:36,000
Scott: So now that you know, it's cheap now and it much easier to get you don't have to pre-order anything.

151
00:11:36,664 --> 00:11:37,651
Scott: No reason not to get.

152
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:38,799
Scott: at least try Netflix.

153
00:11:39,502 --> 00:11:46,360
Rym: Why I remember when you bought that you pretty much every day you watch one episode until you've seen the whole thing 39 It's a lot of episode.

154
00:11:46,442 --> 00:11:49,409
Scott: Oh, yeah I think the thing is like the 26th episode.

155
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:53,884
Scott: you could you could just pretend that's the end and then because it was popular There are 13 more episodes.

156
00:11:53,924 --> 00:11:54,666
Scott: There's another end.

157
00:11:55,389 --> 00:12:01,632
Scott: That's the original Macross TV series, which if you're an anime fan I don't care if you like it or not.

158
00:12:01,772 --> 00:12:06,780
Scott: If you sort of just have to watch it You won't really understand like you whether you like Ava or not.

159
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,485
Scott: I don't give a shit.

160
00:12:07,505 --> 00:12:13,040
Scott: you have to watch it or else you just really Won't have the correct perspective on any other anime you're watching.

161
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,328
Rym: I mean some shows are definitely must watches.

162
00:12:15,388 --> 00:12:16,130
Rym: some shows aren't.

163
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:20,446
Rym: a lot of shows aren't but there's some things that just It's kind of like in film.

164
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:25,485
Rym: if you care at all about movies that you have to have seen Citizen Kane You have to like Citizen Kane.

165
00:12:25,505 --> 00:12:26,930
Rym: You have to have seen it.

166
00:12:27,271 --> 00:12:28,656
Scott: Yeah, or else what you?

167
00:12:28,857 --> 00:12:29,680
Scott: nothing you say counts.

168
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,563
Scott: Basically, it's like.

169
00:12:30,964 --> 00:12:39,500
Scott: it's like if you go to a film class, right and you try to argue with the film professor about something You go blah blah blah blah blah and then people find out like you haven't seen Citizen Kane at all.

170
00:12:39,661 --> 00:12:40,465
Scott: You have never watched it.

171
00:12:40,485 --> 00:12:41,491
Scott: They'll be like nothing.

172
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:42,155
Scott: you say counts.

173
00:12:42,255 --> 00:12:42,879
Scott: You don't know anything.

174
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:44,505
Scott: So you nothing.

175
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:45,830
Scott: you say counts about anime.

176
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:47,336
Scott: unless you watch Macross and it's 25 years old.

177
00:12:47,356 --> 00:13:02,300
Scott: now I think if something's still popular enough after 25 years for them to make another show out of it Whether you like it or not I think that the fact that something is so popular should tell you that it's notable and meaningful enough that it deserves.

178
00:13:02,401 --> 00:13:05,906
Scott: You are watching once in your life I mean think about other crap shows.

179
00:13:05,946 --> 00:13:07,431
Scott: how many Naruto episodes have you watched?

180
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:09,117
Scott: like a hundred something you can watch.

181
00:13:09,117 --> 00:13:09,337
Scott: 39 Macross.

182
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:12,093
Scott: Yeah, I'm even need to watch 39.

00:13:14,714 --> 00:13:24,551
Rym: is Fullmetal Alchemist going to be remembered as this great animation or this great show that touched the hearts of millions 25 years from now.

186
00:13:24,712 --> 00:13:25,697
Scott: No one of you remember 20 now.

187
00:13:27,982 --> 00:13:32,818
Scott: Seriously name any other anime that came out 25 years ago the same year as Macross.

188
00:13:32,838 --> 00:13:49,160

00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:44,343
Rym: Now.

202
00:14:44,443 --> 00:14:45,347
Rym: the best part is.

00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:52,314
Rym: I didn't really realize this but the person who directed gog manga biore You know, we're still directing it was a guitar daichi.

204
00:14:52,374 --> 00:14:53,860
Rym: I guess I never looked up who directed it.

205
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,363
Rym: I don't know why.

206
00:14:54,383 --> 00:14:55,630
Rym: I guess that was stupid or something.

207
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:57,240
Rym: I know wrote it, but I didn't know directed it.

208
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:10,240
Rym: Daichi also directed koto chow fruits basket and animation runner koromi Which has anime news network says he is known for bizarre plot setups and non sequitur humor.

209
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,790
Scott: Oh, that sounds about right to me.

210
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:18,488
Scott: that about sums up gog manga biore Bizarre plot setups and non sequitur humor.

211
00:15:18,528 --> 00:15:24,665
Rym: Just that first episode that sticker and it won't come off Seriously.

212
00:15:24,686 --> 00:15:26,760
Rym: the show is so worth watching.

213
00:15:27,341 --> 00:15:30,935
Scott: If you're not watching gog manga biore You're watching the butts.

214
00:15:32,303 --> 00:15:32,849
Rym: That was great.

215
00:15:33,071 --> 00:15:39,217
Rym: And if you're a fan subber Fan sub this I don't need four more translations of every episode of Naruto.

216
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:48,678
Rym: I need this exactly things of the day.

217
00:15:49,562 --> 00:15:52,872
Scott: So I found this website here and I'm sort of torn.

218
00:15:52,912 --> 00:15:58,570
Scott: and whether this is a good website or a bad website website Let me tell you what it does and then you can decide for yourself.

219
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:58,931
Scott: You ready?

220
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:01,400
Scott: The website is woweeo.com.

221
00:16:01,884 --> 00:16:09,555
Scott: w-o-w-o W's o W I O Wow, yo like Oreo, I guess.

222
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:11,120
Rym: is this about Wario?

223
00:16:11,481 --> 00:16:12,223
Scott: No, nothing to do.

224
00:16:12,243 --> 00:16:16,093
Scott: the Wario basically the subtitle under the under the word.

225
00:16:16,113 --> 00:16:16,394
Scott: Wow.

226
00:16:16,414 --> 00:16:20,384
Scott: Yo says free books free minds On this website.

227
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:24,273
Scott: There are indeed free books with paying no money.

228
00:16:24,694 --> 00:16:37,518
Scott: You can download PDFs of books Most and the thing that's especially cool about this website is There's a lot of comic books on this website that you can download and read for free.

229
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,278
Scott: Absolutely, no money paid to them whatsoever.

230
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:46,398
Scott: You just sign up for an account and you sort of to fill in a lot of information that I was uncomfortable filling in.

231
00:16:46,921 --> 00:16:47,828
Rym: but could you lie?

232
00:16:48,331 --> 00:16:52,558
Scott: Yeah, I guess okay and In the end free books.

233
00:16:52,619 --> 00:17:11,300
Scott: now The way it works is you go and you you go around the website finding books and you click add to queue and it goes to your queue right and then you go to your queue and your queue will show you of course all the books in your queue and I think every day you can download like three of the books for free and that should be enough.

234
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,984
Scott: I mean right how fast you can read these books.

235
00:17:13,146 --> 00:17:15,212
Rym: Well, it depends got a train commute.

236
00:17:15,252 --> 00:17:23,878
Scott: Yep, and the books that you download are As far as I can tell DRM free PDFs, they're just PDFs.

237
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:29,335
Scott: But at the first page of the book, there's an ad and the last page of the book.

238
00:17:29,797 --> 00:17:30,560
Scott: There's an ad.

239
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:43,340
Scott: uh-huh, so and as far as I can tell When you download a book the person it like, you know Let's say I write a comic book, right and then I put my comic book up on Wowio and then you download it.

240
00:17:43,985 --> 00:17:45,659
Scott: I think I get some of that ad money.

241
00:17:46,261 --> 00:17:53,940
Scott: So you're basically getting free books and the people who made the books are getting some money and you're not getting any DRMs.

242
00:17:54,582 --> 00:17:58,475
Scott: But you can only download so many a day and there's an ad in there.

243
00:17:58,515 --> 00:18:00,080
Scott: the ones I got had Verizon ads.

244
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:06,040
Scott: There was a big Verizon ad on the first page the big Verizon ad on the last page But none in the middle of the book where it would get in my way.

245
00:18:07,221 --> 00:18:08,085
Rym: That's not too bad.

246
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:09,371
Scott: It's not too bad.

247
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:11,240
Scott: I mean it could be a lot worse.

248
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,366
Scott: There could be DRMs.

249
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:14,660
Scott: There might be DRMs, but I haven't noticed any.

250
00:18:15,482 --> 00:18:28,280
Scott: And it's a PDF and it's free books and lots of comic books for free, especially comic books You're probably you know, I normally wouldn't read a lot of these if they cost money, but they don't cost any money.

251
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,224
Scott: So I'm reading stuff.

252
00:18:29,304 --> 00:18:32,919
Scott: I normally wouldn't otherwise read and that's pretty cool.

253
00:18:33,723 --> 00:18:39,182
Scott: So if you're looking for some free comics without some you know Bit torrents.

254
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,668
Scott: There you go.

255
00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:42,937
Scott: No moral quandaries at all.

256
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:43,720
Rym: All right.

257
00:18:44,561 --> 00:18:52,001
Rym: so this guy has a pit bull and his pit bull likes nothing more than to chase the light from a Flashlight.

258
00:18:52,022 --> 00:18:54,831
Rym: sounds like every dog not every dog and not every cat.

259
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:57,480
Scott: I mean, however, you get like the wristwatch reflection.

260
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,298
Scott: You'd mess with the cats.

261
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:03,559
Rym: well, I remember when I lived in that the condo when I first worked at IBM while I was still on co-op from RIT.

262
00:19:03,639 --> 00:19:07,497
Rym: and I lived in this condo and the lady was never there.

263
00:19:07,517 --> 00:19:07,960
Rym: who owned it.

264
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:16,891
Rym: so I basically had the condo to myself and her two cats were just there and fed him every now and then whatever and They were content to ignore me unless I pulled out the laser pen.

265
00:19:17,593 --> 00:19:19,640
Rym: one of them went bad shit.

266
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:21,491
Rym: That laser pen was the best thing ever.

267
00:19:21,512 --> 00:19:22,860
Rym: It would chase that thing forever.

268
00:19:23,784 --> 00:19:33,332
Rym: the other one either couldn't see the laser pen light or something because they would just look at the other cat like it was crazy and Basically hit it every time it went over the laser pen.

269
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,519
Rym: Like what are you doing and keep it away?

270
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,840
Rym: So of course hours upon hours of entertainment for him, you have cats love them laser pens.

271
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:45,259
Rym: so This guy is a pit bull who likes the light.

272
00:19:45,944 --> 00:19:48,542
Rym: And you know, it doesn't have enough time to take care of the dog all the time You can't play.

273
00:19:48,602 --> 00:19:54,709
Rym: I mean while I would love to spend the rest of my life playing with puppies and doing nothing else I don't have time to play with puppies all the times.

274
00:19:54,729 --> 00:19:56,920
Rym: I've had a puppy and I needed to keep him occupied.

275
00:19:57,901 --> 00:20:04,920
Rym: What better way than to simply put the flashlight around his neck and thereby create a self-sustaining chain reaction?

276
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,446
Scott: Yeah, it's like we should tape.

277
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:14,044
Scott: someone needs to make a video stat where you tape a laser Crappy DVD a laser pen to the top of a cat's head Aiming forward.

278
00:20:14,264 --> 00:20:18,116
Rym: Why don't we just tape a crappy DVD in front of Scott Johnson's face?

279
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,450
Rym: Oh We love you Scott.

280
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:20,914
Scott: Don't worry.

281
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:31,791
Rym: Well, maybe you do But I think the best part is the dog immediately chases this thing upstairs and disappears And then comes back down and runs in a circle, right?

282
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:32,293
Scott: Yeah.

283
00:20:32,394 --> 00:20:33,840
Rym: Yeah, it's worth watching.

284
00:20:34,862 --> 00:20:35,847
Scott: Pretty funny stuff.

285
00:20:35,888 --> 00:20:37,940
Scott: those animals with the lights do right things.

286
00:20:38,442 --> 00:20:48,977
Scott: so I generally I like really like any sort of video where it takes an animal and then Combines it with human technology that it can't possibly understand to confuse it and make it do weird things.

287
00:20:49,017 --> 00:20:51,767
Rym: confuse a cat Confuse a cat confuse a cat.

288
00:20:51,787 --> 00:20:53,533
Scott: We should make a device that confuse a cat.

289
00:20:53,814 --> 00:20:54,336
Scott: turn it on.

290
00:20:54,397 --> 00:20:55,099
Scott: cats go crazy.

291
00:20:56,503 --> 00:20:57,209
Rym: It's called catnip.

292
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,498
Scott: I know right.

293
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,769
Scott: so Actually, I saw a great video of catnip.

294
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:04,017
Scott: there was like a catnip tree and a whole bunch of cats.

295
00:21:04,077 --> 00:21:04,779
Rym: I saw that.

296
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,419
Scott: Yeah, I saw that those cats are like way stoned.

297
00:21:09,421 --> 00:21:11,430
Scott: Okay, you can do the main bit.

298
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,254
Rym: There's no people nip.

299
00:21:12,374 --> 00:21:12,957
Rym: Well, I guess there is.

300
00:21:12,977 --> 00:21:13,660
Rym: it's called marijuana.

301
00:21:13,821 --> 00:21:14,844
Scott: I wish there was people nip.

302
00:21:14,965 --> 00:21:15,286
Rym: there is.

303
00:21:15,346 --> 00:21:17,093
Rym: it's called marijuana didn't require smoking.

304
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:18,036
Scott: Like you just kind of pet it.

305
00:21:18,056 --> 00:21:18,919
Rym: you make brownies.

306
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:21,147
Scott: That didn't require eating either.

307
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:22,153
Scott: cats don't have to eat the cat.

308
00:21:22,173 --> 00:21:29,160
Scott: if they just kind of sit near and they go Hey What what can I sit near and get high without any side effects?

309
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:35,175
Rym: Well, there was that time I shared a small diner with someone who was obviously smoking a joint the whole time in the other stall.

310
00:21:35,275 --> 00:21:36,760
Rym: but right, right.

311
00:21:37,224 --> 00:21:42,189
Rym: So, uh a while ago I've always just not had time to read comic books.

312
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:46,585
Rym: Scott piles them up in front of me and I'm usually reading I don't know Word books.

313
00:21:46,786 --> 00:21:49,779
Scott: I read word books - what was the last word book you read?

314
00:21:51,546 --> 00:21:54,401
Rym: Star Wars Something.

315
00:21:54,662 --> 00:21:58,353
Scott: Yeah, those those kind of a star with these on Star Wars.

316
00:21:58,393 --> 00:22:01,645
Scott: I'm gonna read it a word book soon I promise.

317
00:22:01,926 --> 00:22:02,629
Rym: actually tomorrow.

318
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:05,665
Rym: I'll have a geek bite about the most recent word book I read.

319
00:22:06,028 --> 00:22:08,905
Scott: maybe I'll have to read those Princes of nothing or something.

320
00:22:09,106 --> 00:22:09,849
Rym: You got to read one.

321
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:12,880
Rym: either got to read the Dan Simmons books or the our Scott Becker books.

322
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,604
Rym: It's one of the two.

323
00:22:13,644 --> 00:22:14,006
Scott: That's right.

324
00:22:14,026 --> 00:22:15,855
Scott: Does that those the ones downstairs?

325
00:22:15,895 --> 00:22:16,960
Rym: Yeah, I love it.

326
00:22:17,463 --> 00:22:25,401
Rym: I've been trying to tell Scott to read this one book forever Ever since I read it because Alex told me to and Alex has been trying to tell him for the longest time to read these Other.

327
00:22:25,421 --> 00:22:27,469
Scott: well those other books I actually kind of wanted to read.

328
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:31,619
Rym: I asked for him and he said he had him and Scott finally Realized that they're both by the same guy.

329
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:39,872
Scott: it seems to be a lot of things that happen in my life where I see two things and they're separate in my mind and Then I realized oh they're both the same guy and then they become connected.

330
00:22:40,113 --> 00:22:40,555
Rym: or wasn't that?

331
00:22:40,575 --> 00:22:43,188
Rym: when everyone told you to read snow crash For like a year.

332
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:55,151
Scott: I don't remember Anyway, so finally a while ago I picked up if you haven't noticed like even if something is something I'd like to do People telling me to do something usually works the opposite for me.

333
00:22:55,191 --> 00:22:56,736
Scott: I tend not to do what I'm told.

334
00:22:56,796 --> 00:22:57,920
Rym: Don't read word books.

335
00:22:58,621 --> 00:23:00,259
Scott: Okay, I'll have to go read some word books now.

336
00:23:00,665 --> 00:23:13,876
Rym: so finally I just randomly I need something to read on the train and I picked up one of the countless things Scott leaves in a pile for me outside my door all the time and it was Batman the Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller.

337
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:23,971
Scott: hallelujah Not only does him finally read an underwear pervert, but he reads pretty much The best Batman book there ever was or pot is still is.

338
00:23:23,991 --> 00:23:29,531
Scott: I contend that this is not only perhaps the second or third best Underwear pervert comic there is ever.

339
00:23:29,652 --> 00:23:33,849
Rym: I contend that while this is Undoubtedly one of the best Batman works ever.

340
00:23:33,869 --> 00:23:37,000
Rym: I think it is also one of the best Superman books.

341
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,579
Scott: How many Superman books have you read?

342
00:23:40,061 --> 00:23:42,608
Scott: One so how qualified are you to really say that?

343
00:23:42,949 --> 00:23:46,299
Rym: a better one and I'll read it.

344
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,212
Scott: Supposedly that Superman for all seasons is really good, but I haven't read it.

345
00:23:50,232 --> 00:23:50,855
Scott: So I'm not gonna.

346
00:23:50,955 --> 00:23:55,691
Rym: I'm not gonna say for sure okay, but uh, I knew this is the kind of.

347
00:23:55,731 --> 00:24:08,743
Rym: this is something that I should have read for a long time because Everyone I've ever talked to who has read it has looked at me with the same Look that I gave people who had never seen snatch Ready.

348
00:24:08,944 --> 00:24:12,140
Scott: it's such a piece of like comics, you know history.

349
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,599
Scott: I mean like there's so many things just based on it.

350
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,914
Scott: Hey, like they there were darkwing duck episodes that directly parody this comic.

351
00:24:20,954 --> 00:24:22,920
Rym: That's how pervasive is the new Batman?

352
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,946
Rym: Even gonna influence heavily by this.

353
00:24:24,986 --> 00:24:28,458
Scott: Well, the new Batman is called the Dark Knight and it does the Joker and it.

354
00:24:28,478 --> 00:24:28,980
Scott: but who knows?

355
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,087
Scott: What the plots actually I saw.

356
00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:34,940
Scott: I mean, it can't be the same plot and it because the major plot point.

357
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,753
Scott: I'm gonna sum up the plot real quick here.

358
00:24:36,773 --> 00:24:39,408
Scott: It's a Batman plot So right that he and I got.

359
00:24:39,448 --> 00:24:41,840
Scott: I want to spoil it because this is a review and not a final thoughts.

360
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,688
Scott: So this book might deserve some final thoughts.

361
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:44,331
Rym: I think it does.

362
00:24:44,391 --> 00:24:46,460
Rym: if Watchmen deserved one then this deserves one, right?

363
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,169
Scott: Here's the basic story of the Dark Knight Returns.

364
00:24:49,229 --> 00:24:52,300
Scott: First of all, the story is not in a DC Universe directly.

365
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,183
Scott: It's you know, one of those.

366
00:24:53,485 --> 00:24:56,095
Scott: I'm just gonna tell a Batman story off to the side here deals.

367
00:24:56,155 --> 00:24:58,664
Rym: granted as far as I'm concerned This is fucking Batman.

368
00:24:58,765 --> 00:24:59,668
Scott: Yes fucking Batman.

369
00:24:59,728 --> 00:25:07,286
Rym: I mean both this and the animated series are Batman Exactly in my mind Batman and 1989 Batman.

370
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:14,999
Rym: in my mind Batman's life was the animated series and then the animated movie happened And then this is the end of all that anyway.

371
00:25:15,742 --> 00:25:21,978
Scott: So Batman is an old geezer like 60 70 something and he hasn't been Batman in a long time.

372
00:25:22,018 --> 00:25:22,680
Rym: He's giving it up.

373
00:25:22,941 --> 00:25:25,013
Scott: He's giving it up because he's so old right.

374
00:25:25,456 --> 00:25:37,457
Scott: and of course Superman is still Superman because well, he's powerful and he's an alien and you know and Gotham City Commissioner Gordon's gonna retire cuz he's wicked old too, but he's not retiring quite yet.

375
00:25:37,517 --> 00:25:38,360
Scott: He's retiring soon.

376
00:25:38,721 --> 00:25:42,639
Rym: It's one of those, you know, the buddy cop movies where I'm gonna retire next month.

377
00:25:42,981 --> 00:25:47,620
Scott: Just got to solve this last case and the last case is this is gang of mutants like this?

378
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:50,393
Scott: Well, it's not a gang of mutants is a gang called the mute.

379
00:25:50,413 --> 00:25:51,900
Rym: They're basically just jackasses.

380
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,449
Scott: They're basically just jackasses and they're typical.

381
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:58,203
Scott: They're stereotypical 80s punk assholes I like.

382
00:25:58,263 --> 00:26:01,960
Scott: they're the kind of bad guys you beat up in like Streets of Rage your final fight.

383
00:26:02,364 --> 00:26:03,920
Rym: I like their lingo so much.

384
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,341
Rym: It's just.

385
00:26:04,542 --> 00:26:06,186
Rym: it's like my mom chicken legs.

386
00:26:06,246 --> 00:26:11,360
Rym: all lines are busy Chegg's my kind of nasty Rob Chegg's Billy Chegg's preg school mutant.

387
00:26:11,461 --> 00:26:17,838
Rym: Yeah, leader figure I squared you boys Mutants we slice the dices Bro, she don't shave.

388
00:26:18,686 --> 00:26:21,660
Scott: Yeah, they keep saying they don't shave anyway.

389
00:26:22,887 --> 00:26:31,180
Scott: so As soon as they you know Basically get rid of these mutants then the Commissioner Gordon will retire and everything will be cool, right?

390
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:34,705
Scott: but Batman gets Stirred up.

391
00:26:35,167 --> 00:26:38,400
Scott: that old man, you know, he just can't you know sit down for too long.

392
00:26:38,621 --> 00:26:39,486
Rym: He tries that.

393
00:26:39,526 --> 00:26:39,707
Rym: that's.

394
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:45,072
Rym: probably the best thing about this is that Batman almost never speaks in the whole thing.

395
00:26:45,132 --> 00:26:51,395
Rym: He's just thinking to himself quietly Yep, and it's interesting because whenever you see Batman like the animated series even the movies.

396
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:52,580
Rym: He doesn't talk.

397
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:58,120
Rym: He just he's this silent figure that's just beating people up and he's doing his thing.

398
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,104
Rym: But he's always silent.

399
00:26:59,565 --> 00:27:03,300
Rym: and reading this you get this constant running commentary of what he's thinking.

400
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:04,307
Rym: Yep, and you know what?

401
00:27:04,428 --> 00:27:09,580
Scott: That's exactly what Batman should have been thinking I'm not gonna go through the rest of the plot, but cuz I don't want to spoil it.

402
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:18,920
Scott: But let let's let me give you the information and why this is such an important comic Even if the you know, the contents of the comic were terrible, which they aren't.

403
00:27:20,142 --> 00:27:21,480
Scott: Here's why this is so important, right?

404
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:27,200
Scott: It was three comic book issues and they were came out in February March April May June.

405
00:27:27,281 --> 00:27:28,351
Scott: I think I'm not sure.

406
00:27:28,593 --> 00:27:29,320
Scott: it's three issues.

407
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,128
Scott: You can buy them all in one trade.

408
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,032
Scott: if you got.

409
00:27:32,092 --> 00:27:37,760
Scott: you can also buy absolute Dark Knight Which is a giant book that also has the Dark Knight Strikes Back, but you don't want that.

410
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,413
Scott: You just want to get the little trade paper back.

411
00:27:39,453 --> 00:27:42,184
Scott: It's real cheap And it can.

412
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:48,426
Scott: it collects three comic book issues that were come out in 1986. this comic book is from 1986.

413
00:27:48,426 --> 00:27:51,614
Scott: I was four years old when this came out.

414
00:27:51,835 --> 00:27:52,938
Scott: My brother was born.

415
00:27:52,978 --> 00:28:17,879
Scott: He was zero okay, and Basically Batman started out when Batman was a brand new comic in the 30s, you know as sort of this grim gritty underworld kind of deal, but eventually Batman became a Corny Adam West Silver Age Batman with you know Robin and tights and goofball, you know pow zach, you know kind of action.

416
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:23,970
Scott: and That was not exactly The best or the most exciting.

417
00:28:24,874 --> 00:28:39,159
Scott: and it wasn't until 1986 when Frank Miller read some Kazuo Koike and then made this comic that Batman returned to being dark and gritty and underworld II and all that sort of stuff.

418
00:28:39,179 --> 00:29:01,896
Scott: and You know in the early 90s in the late 80s and such when all those other dark and gritty comics appeared You know like the serious Ghost Rider and the Punishers and the Wolverines, which is also Frank Miller all those comics Only your cable all that stuff only existed because of this comic and all you go.

419
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:08,174
Scott: and even still today There's still like within you know, the superhero comics in the u.s.

420
00:29:08,595 --> 00:29:15,320
Scott: This sort of or even in the non superhero There's that sort of sub Genre of the the dark and the gritty comics.

421
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:21,600
Scott: Yeah, you want these dark gritty ones are over here and those exist because of this book and this book alone.

422
00:29:23,483 --> 00:29:25,760
Scott: So yeah, it's a it's a pretty important comic.

423
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:30,219
Scott: I mean really that 1989 Batman movie probably wouldn't happen without this comic.

424
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:39,051
Scott: also a lot of the this if you look there's a list on Wikipedia of Like Oh mashes that have been made to this comic.

425
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:41,299
Scott: There are quite a lot of them.

426
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,764
Scott: like a whole bunch.

427
00:29:44,025 --> 00:29:54,150
Scott: we're talking like artists of all shapes and sizes have looked to this one comic just three issues only three issues here and Have paid it quite a bit of respect.

428
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:56,300
Scott: So there is something here that is important.

429
00:29:56,601 --> 00:30:06,840
Scott: Alright, so the comic is written and drawn by Frank Miller Although the inking and the lettering and the coloring was done by other people like Klaus Janssen and Lynn Varley and people.

430
00:30:08,221 --> 00:30:09,968
Scott: But Frank Miller is the guy who wrote it.

431
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:26,140
Scott: now you might heard of Frank Miller from such things as The 300 the Sin City, which is sort of where Sin City is sort of like the perfection Oh, I guess his perfection of the grim and gritty kind of stuff, you know It's like he started here and then he built on it and he got better at it.

432
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,120
Scott: And then he he needs the Wolverine and then he did the Sin City, right?

433
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:36,396
Scott: So if you notice they're turning a lot of his stuff into the movies there Maybe because he's pretty good at writing.

434
00:30:36,437 --> 00:30:44,800
Scott: of course don't assume that because something says Frank Miller on it that it's good because from what I hear a lot of his Newer stuff is not so good.

435
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:51,319
Scott: And also the I hear that the Dark Knight Strikes Back Which I have not read which is the sequel to this is also not so good.

436
00:30:51,821 --> 00:30:57,605
Rym: See that was the thing because I said I read the Frank and Miller Batman to the comic geek speak people and all those guys at the NYAF.

437
00:30:57,827 --> 00:31:04,627
Rym: Yeah, and the first thing they said is You mean the Dark Knight Returns, right?

438
00:31:04,968 --> 00:31:05,209
Scott: Yeah.

439
00:31:05,932 --> 00:31:08,220
Rym: Yeah, don't read anything else good God.

440
00:31:09,022 --> 00:31:10,145
Scott: Yeah, he's not.

441
00:31:10,225 --> 00:31:18,683
Scott: Frank Miller is an awesome and very important comic person that you need to know about but by no means is everything He has ever made Amazing.

442
00:31:18,964 --> 00:31:31,260
Scott: and this is perhaps is you know, I guess the thing he will always be most famous for is basically Making Batman awesome again instead of being corny-ass Adam West Batman like he always was before then.

443
00:31:31,661 --> 00:31:35,360
Rym: I guess we could try to talk a little bit about exactly what it was that made this so good.

444
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,624
Rym: I mean, I love this.

445
00:31:36,665 --> 00:31:40,036
Scott: Well, first of all, the arts is like the amazing.

446
00:31:40,418 --> 00:31:45,815
Rym: It's very Very I don't know simple and stylized and flat.

447
00:31:46,176 --> 00:32:00,700
Scott: it really feels Really like the time to me like it feels sort of like dark 80s, you know It's like I looking at it really reading this comic gives me the same feeling I get when I watch a really good Batman movie.

448
00:32:00,801 --> 00:32:06,420
Scott: it's like a really good Batman movie on paper and You know, it's sort of the way it's drawn.

449
00:32:07,062 --> 00:32:15,789
Scott: It looks just like that 1989 Batman movie or at least it might not graphically look the same But it gives the same feeling to me when I look at it.

450
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,474
Scott: Well, it's take it into my brain.

451
00:32:17,615 --> 00:32:24,240
Rym: It's done very I don't know Cinemagraphically, I mean you look at it and it's just it's almost like it's storyboards for the movie.

452
00:32:24,501 --> 00:32:49,356
Scott: Yeah, this they always do this thing where they'll break a page down Especially when they they cut to these things where they show the news and there's people like talking heads on the news talking about Batman and stuff like that and they'll break the page down into a lot of little panels of like a TV screen with the narration and the narrations are always on top and you sort of have to read them left left to right and it can be A little confusing until you realize how it's organized.

453
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:53,899
Scott: sorta I got messed up reading it and the in the wrong order a few times some of those.

454
00:32:54,742 --> 00:33:04,420
Scott: But when they cut to those TVs, it's always really interesting because it's like hey, here's what you know People are saying about Batman and it really brings back that whole.

455
00:33:04,801 --> 00:33:10,037
Scott: Yeah, Batman's a hero fighting crime and you know, but it brings that that sort of.

456
00:33:10,578 --> 00:33:13,214
Scott: you know Is Batman in line with the law?

457
00:33:13,234 --> 00:33:23,120
Scott: He's a vigilante He's actually a terrible horrible person kind of thing and it really brings that issue back to the forefront of Batman where it Completely was not an issue.

458
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:31,970
Scott: I mean you watch an Adam West Batman or you read a Silver Age Batman comic and it's just like oh Let that there's a bad guy better turn on the bad signal.

459
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:32,954
Scott: So Batman will save us.

460
00:33:32,994 --> 00:33:34,519
Scott: Yeah, Batman saved us.

461
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:45,428
Rym: Yeah, I mean it definitely has that sort of current social commentary, you know, the old guards going out I mean the mayor whatever Commissioner Gordon's retiring Batman was retired.

462
00:33:45,508 --> 00:33:50,500
Rym: everything the new worlds coming in the new 80s world is just all the new young kids.

463
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:56,480
Rym: I mean they keep pointing out that all the young cops Barely, even believe that Batman ever exist.

464
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,627
Scott: Yeah, all the kids don't even believe me.

465
00:33:58,668 --> 00:34:04,647
Scott: Batman's been retired for 15 years or something like that and Superman Officially doesn't exist.

466
00:34:04,687 --> 00:34:07,220
Rym: So a lot of people don't believe that Superman ever even existed.

467
00:34:07,471 --> 00:34:09,164
Rym: Yeah And it's kind of like there's this.

468
00:34:09,786 --> 00:34:15,239
Rym: all the older people remember this world that the new generation just has no idea about.

469
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,165
Scott: Yeah, they talk about.

470
00:34:16,185 --> 00:34:30,572
Scott: yeah, they used to be heroes blah blah blah I mean in the introduction it talks about like this bar that you can't get to and there's people in the bar You know talking about a time when there are heroes and there aren't heroes anymore and there really aren't heroes anymore as far as Normal people are concerned.

471
00:34:30,592 --> 00:34:33,085
Scott: They don't believe in them They'd never see him etc, etc.

472
00:34:33,567 --> 00:34:37,960
Rym: And there's just a lot of a lot of very contemporary political issues from the time.

473
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:42,605
Rym: I mean, there's a lot of this idea of can criminals be rehabilitated?

474
00:34:42,686 --> 00:34:46,688
Rym: what's the line between Punishment and rehabilitation and reform?

475
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:52,226
Rym: it's also cold war action going on and it all the thing I think what's beautiful about it.

476
00:34:52,306 --> 00:34:59,319
Rym: Is that every single one of these elements is Brought together into one coherent whole and they all mirror each other.

477
00:34:59,941 --> 00:35:02,770
Rym: The Cold War is kind of like this macrocosm.

478
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:11,771
Rym: look at everything that's going on on the micro level in everyone's lives in this comic And the conflicts are the same just on different scales.

479
00:35:11,911 --> 00:35:14,220
Rym: and it's it's all these warring ideologies.

480
00:35:14,762 --> 00:35:17,452
Rym: I mean, what's the line that I think the biggest point is?

481
00:35:17,512 --> 00:35:19,620
Rym: what's the line between justice and revenge?

482
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:24,499
Rym: Mm-hmm, and what's the line between being a hero and being a god?

483
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:36,180
Scott: The the one thing that really gets me is how Batman is always think like it starts like Bruce Wayne's driving in a race car And the car is like on fire gonna crash and he's thinking well, this wouldn't be such a bad day

484
00:35:36,461 --> 00:35:38,975
Rym: But not good enough but not a good enough day

485
00:35:39,015 --> 00:35:39,860
Scott: not good enough death.

486
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:46,159
Scott: So he jumps out of the flaming car and then later on like, you know something's happening and he's pretty much like, huh?

487
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,089
Scott: I could let you know, he's like, uh, I could die here.

488
00:35:49,109 --> 00:35:54,485
Scott: I could let him I could let someone die But then I wouldn't find out something.

489
00:35:54,505 --> 00:36:01,884
Scott: and he always comes like the verge of like killing himself or killing someone or letting himself Die.

490
00:36:02,346 --> 00:36:05,800
Scott: or you know kamikaze ing and he's always he's thinking about dying.

491
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:15,060
Scott: It's like it's welling on his mind the whole time and he's really serious about it, but stuff Oh, it always turns out in a really weird way.

492
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,660
Scott: But like at any moment you think he could just kill himself and that would totally make sense.

493
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:23,400
Rym: Well, I think part of it is that he felt like when he retired when he was no longer Batman.

494
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:27,660
Rym: He was Bruce Wayne He was dead and he was basically just waiting to die.

495
00:36:28,222 --> 00:36:31,051
Rym: And he just he couldn't bring himself to die.

496
00:36:31,091 --> 00:36:33,097
Rym: and eventually the Batman came back.

497
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:36,171
Scott: Yep I mean basically show it.

498
00:36:36,372 --> 00:36:42,173
Scott: it's sort of trying to say look He is Batman can't change what you are can't escape the Batman.

499
00:36:42,213 --> 00:36:42,774
Scott: He's in you.

500
00:36:43,396 --> 00:36:44,218
Scott: You can't avoid him.

501
00:36:44,459 --> 00:36:45,162
Rym: Yes No, no they can't.

502
00:36:49,301 --> 00:36:58,672
Rym: But also I think what was interesting is every time he's fighting someone just that the dialogue that's coming That's in Batman's head and what he's thinking and why he does what he does.

503
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:02,849
Rym: and you know in the in the comics or in The show Batman doesn't kill people.

504
00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:03,653
Rym: He's very just.

505
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:04,859
Rym: he always does the right thing.

506
00:37:05,402 --> 00:37:12,540
Rym: But pretty much every time he's confronted with the scum of the earth He is constantly thinking I should kill this man.

507
00:37:12,661 --> 00:37:15,277
Rym: The world would be better off if I just killed this man.

508
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:18,312
Rym: right now All I have to do is pull the trigger and this is over.

509
00:37:18,332 --> 00:37:21,146
Rym: I don't have to risk my life I don't have to fight him.

510
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:24,080
Rym: I could just shoot him from here and everything would be better.

511
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:25,017
Rym: No one would miss him.

512
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:27,207
Rym: It would be nothing but a good act.

513
00:37:27,308 --> 00:37:29,014
Rym: and yet he can never bring himself to do.

514
00:37:29,054 --> 00:37:36,720
Scott: greatest part is where he's driving the Batmobile Up and he encounters someone who he knows is much stronger than he is and I'll probably beat the shit out of him, right?

515
00:37:37,401 --> 00:37:38,369
Scott: So what does he do?

516
00:37:38,752 --> 00:37:39,418
Scott: He's like, huh?

517
00:37:40,121 --> 00:37:52,500
Scott: You know that wouldn't be quite such a bad way to die and he gets out of the Batmobile to just fight the guy You know with bare fists and whatnot and knowing that he's totally outmatched and that's it really shows you like, huh?

518
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,366
Scott: Something's going on in his mind there.

519
00:37:55,387 --> 00:37:56,330
Scott: He could be crazy.

520
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:59,080
Scott: and they have this on the during the TV scenes.

521
00:37:59,461 --> 00:38:03,652
Scott: They always have you know, Lana Lang from the Daily Planet or not.

522
00:38:03,872 --> 00:38:04,233
Scott: I don't know.

523
00:38:04,314 --> 00:38:06,800
Scott: Yeah, Daily Planet Daily bugle is spider-man, right?

524
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,526
Rym: Yeah, I think so.

525
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:11,158
Scott: I don't know but It's always like, you know.

526
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:17,900
Scott: Yeah, Batman's great saving world heroes are great, you know, where would you be without them blood?

527
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,529
Scott: We just get owned by all these crazy supervillains.

528
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,697
Scott: and there's the psychologist guy who's like.

529
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:31,932
Scott: no all these Supervillains are doing their thing because of Batman and they actually because of the way certain things play out in the show Not in the show.

530
00:38:32,033 --> 00:38:32,579
Scott: in the comic.

531
00:38:33,681 --> 00:38:35,688
Scott: It's sort of like the site the crate you.

532
00:38:35,828 --> 00:38:38,196
Scott: it's like this guy is saying Batman is bad.

533
00:38:38,236 --> 00:38:41,519
Scott: Batman is wrong Causes the crime.

534
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:49,404
Scott: Yeah, Batman gives these insane people a focal point and they even show you at one point in our you know It's Arkham Asylum, right?

535
00:38:49,604 --> 00:38:56,640
Scott: There's some supervillains in Arkham Asylum where they belong and it shows them, you know being sort of not crazy Just sort of being like, you know toted around.

536
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,178
Rym: Well, it's not much spoiler because we know that the Joker is a villain, you know.

537
00:39:00,741 --> 00:39:06,673
Rym: And the Joker is just sitting there and if you don't even notice the Joker It's just some sad old guy in a sanitarium.

538
00:39:07,296 --> 00:39:14,100
Scott: and then they're you know It's the Joker because his face is white but well not really acting very Jokerish because they bring it up kind of suddenly.

539
00:39:14,141 --> 00:39:20,760
Rym: I mean it shows the Newscaster and then it shows these crazy people in an asylum and there's just one just crazy guy and they're all just kind of.

540
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,996
Scott: Well, you saw him earlier in the comic, but he's just you're not you can't yell.

541
00:39:24,016 --> 00:39:25,783
Rym: You're not a hundred percent sure I'm a hundred percent sure.

542
00:39:26,104 --> 00:39:28,152
Rym: Anyway, anyway, you see all these crazy people.

543
00:39:28,172 --> 00:39:40,157
Rym: They're just looking at the TV and being crazy and as Soon as the news points out that Batman has returned They just draw the guy's face completely differently and now he has green hair and it's the Joker.

544
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:42,970
Scott: Yep He totally like Joker's out.

545
00:39:43,111 --> 00:39:50,660
Scott: So it's like hey, maybe bat, you know You're so against this psychiatrist guy who's so much political, correct?

546
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,499
Rym: You shouldn't punish criminals ever which you know.

547
00:39:53,781 --> 00:39:55,667
Rym: That's a whole debate that we talk about more.

548
00:39:55,708 --> 00:40:04,839
Scott: and I guess the final thoughts because you look at you look at half the evidence The comic gives you and you're like this guy is so wrong If we listen to this guy the Joker be running wild blowing everyone up.

549
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:12,280
Scott: But then you look and all the things he says, you know Like Batman caused all these criminals to be just by his mere existence.

550
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:18,020
Scott: It makes it look like it's true and it's like ah, it's a brilliant comic.

551
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,525
Rym: Now I really want.

552
00:40:21,565 --> 00:40:27,589
Rym: I mean we're skipping over a lot of the good parts about this comic and partly that's because you have To read it and then we're going to read it.

553
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:30,340
Rym: a final thought some point in the next couple months.

554
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:40,000
Scott: If you don't read any and if there's only if you only read one underwear perfect comic in your life It should be watchman if you read two underwear perfect comics in your life as you watch them in this.

555
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:46,560
Rym: But I want to talk a little bit about Superman because in general I really don't like the idea of Superman.

556
00:40:46,701 --> 00:40:50,926
Rym: I just it's kind of this lame Relic of the 50s.

557
00:40:50,986 --> 00:40:52,249
Rym: Just what if I made it?

558
00:40:52,269 --> 00:40:59,029
Rym: Superman was 1939, but all the Superman stuff I know of okay, and it's just very kind of.

559
00:40:59,049 --> 00:41:02,900
Rym: he's really powerful and it's all kind of cheesy.

560
00:41:03,643 --> 00:41:04,124
Rym: And it's just.

561
00:41:04,205 --> 00:41:08,098
Scott: I like that soup live-action Superman show from when I was a kid.

562
00:41:09,102 --> 00:41:10,387
Scott: Which one Lois and Clark.

563
00:41:10,407 --> 00:41:12,877
Rym: I like that show too, but that's cuz it was mostly comedy.

564
00:41:13,078 --> 00:41:13,359
Scott: It was.

565
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:21,285
Rym: but Superman is portrayed in a very interesting way in this comic and I just I Really like it.

566
00:41:21,365 --> 00:41:22,772
Rym: I I still think this is what this is.

567
00:41:22,812 --> 00:41:27,690
Rym: This is the best Superman portrayal I have ever seen because you've only seen like one.

568
00:41:27,891 --> 00:41:30,820
Rym: Well, I've seen your Superman movies all the Superman movie.

569
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,846
Scott: No, I don't like the live-action Superman movies.

570
00:41:33,027 --> 00:41:34,030
Scott: Ah, no, no good.

571
00:41:34,431 --> 00:41:37,280
Rym: And I've seen Superman in various animations and things.

572
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,095
Scott: The only Superman animation I like is those original ones cuz it was always like Superman vs.

573
00:41:43,115 --> 00:41:44,658
Scott: The Mad Scientist doo-doo-doo.

574
00:41:46,422 --> 00:41:49,500
Rym: But even they were kind of superficial.

575
00:41:49,981 --> 00:41:55,440
Rym: Superman is only ever shown in two contexts in the entirety of this comic.

576
00:41:55,902 --> 00:41:57,752
Rym: He is always larger than life.

577
00:41:58,093 --> 00:41:59,440
Rym: He is always gigantic.

578
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:06,760
Rym: He always takes up the entire frame whenever he's there just big dashing close-ups, and he's very square jawed.

579
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,070
Rym: he is perfect in every way.

580
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:10,542
Rym: he is a god and Whenever.

581
00:42:10,683 --> 00:42:16,752
Rym: but that's just when they're showing him standing there talking Whenever he's fighting whenever he's doing his Superman thing.

582
00:42:17,395 --> 00:42:18,780
Rym: They don't even show it really.

583
00:42:18,901 --> 00:42:23,124
Rym: it's pretty much just silhouettes and The thought.

584
00:42:23,144 --> 00:42:33,737
Rym: it's kind of like you get the same Batman treatment of just his inner monologue But instead it's Superman and you see what's going through Superman's head and it's just black silhouettes with the red cape and just.

585
00:42:34,158 --> 00:42:37,491
Rym: the style Of all those Superman scenes is amazing.

586
00:42:37,652 --> 00:42:39,700
Rym: And actually I think very meaningful.

587
00:42:39,801 --> 00:42:42,838
Rym: But again, I don't want to really talk about that in any great depth.

588
00:42:42,898 --> 00:42:43,140
Rym: yet

589
00:42:43,742 --> 00:43:03,027
Scott: My favorite part with Superman is when basically someone tells Superman to go take care of Batman, right and You see the scene where Superman storms Gotham City, basically And he cleans up like three or four street crimes and whatever and you never actually see Superman during this whole sequence.

590
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:04,191
Scott: It's like multiple pages.

591
00:43:04,211 --> 00:43:27,801
Scott: They don't draw Superman once they draw this blue beam Coming like into the city and like going right through walls and stuff and it's like someone feels a whoosh go by and then Like some criminal suddenly gets like their brains blown out and then you know Batman standing there and like the wall opens up and someone comes like blasting through the wall and you just see Batman there and like This

592
00:43:27,882 --> 00:43:28,163
Rym: blue

593
00:43:28,363 --> 00:43:32,236
Scott: whoosh goes by him and like there's a big hole in the wall behind him and he's just like.

594
00:43:32,256 --> 00:43:33,681
Scott: I don't have time For this.

595
00:43:33,721 --> 00:43:38,498
Scott: you've cost me a bunch of you wasted a bunch of you cost me like five hours of my time here.

596
00:43:38,799 --> 00:43:43,500
Scott: meet me Tomorrow at my house at whatever time and Superman doesn't say anything.

597
00:43:44,302 --> 00:43:44,463
Scott: You know.

598
00:43:44,503 --> 00:43:54,086
Scott: and it's like, you know, the Superman came through like this storm like this Unknown force of nature that just totally, you know blew everything away.

599
00:43:54,106 --> 00:43:55,368
Scott: No one even knew he was there.

600
00:43:55,388 --> 00:43:56,569
Scott: No one knew it was.

601
00:43:56,629 --> 00:43:56,950
Scott: it was just.

602
00:43:58,141 --> 00:44:00,539
Scott: That's what Superman would be like you just sort of like this.

603
00:44:00,801 --> 00:44:04,112
Scott: You know force of nature that comes through and goes out and you don't know.

604
00:44:04,132 --> 00:44:06,240
Rym: you don't even know just whoosh and a lot of what?

605
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:10,672
Rym: Makes this comic interesting is that you have Batman who is just a human being.

606
00:44:10,932 --> 00:44:12,497
Rym: there's nothing special about that.

607
00:44:12,557 --> 00:44:13,640
Scott: In fact, he's an old geezer.

608
00:44:14,161 --> 00:44:18,995
Rym: Yeah, and yet he does all these things and he tries, you know, he does what he does.

609
00:44:19,015 --> 00:44:19,657
Rym: He's Batman.

610
00:44:20,279 --> 00:44:37,320
Rym: and yet Superman is a god and just the way the two of them handle who they are and what they do and their power and the Root conflict I think of this is between two ideologies and Superman represents one and Batman represents the other and neither.

611
00:44:37,421 --> 00:44:40,380
Scott: Well, it's not like the good ideology versus the bad ideology.

612
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:44,394
Scott: It's like the half good half bad one versus the half good half bad one.

613
00:44:44,434 --> 00:44:46,040
Scott: You're like, ah, what do I do?

614
00:44:46,700 --> 00:45:08,220
Rym: but then there is a scene and this scene is just one of those scenes that sticks with you forever from any sort of work of art and to not really spoil anything basically in the middle of all this the Cold War is kind of coming to a head and They definitely give you the impression they show you bits that at one point the u.s decides to send Superman over to basically crush the Soviet military.

615
00:45:08,762 --> 00:45:17,345
Rym: mmm, and there are repercussions of this and a nuclear weapon gets lost somewhere and Superman goes to save the day.

616
00:45:17,746 --> 00:45:27,600
Rym: and just from that moment on that next like five or six pages of this comic Actually, I think is the next 15 or 20 pages are probably the best part of this entire comic.

617
00:45:27,881 --> 00:45:31,373
Scott: It's weird that in the Batman comic that the Superman part.

618
00:45:31,574 --> 00:45:36,232
Scott: because usually if you're reading the Batman comic You know, especially like if you're us, you know, you don't you don't like you.

619
00:45:36,272 --> 00:45:41,874
Scott: like Batman you want Batman action But there's really very little of that Batman action in this comic.

620
00:45:41,914 --> 00:45:48,080
Scott: It's not a lot of grappling hook I mean, there's only one batmobile scene really and it's really not much.

621
00:45:48,181 --> 00:45:50,980
Scott: It's not one of those, you know racing through the streets batmobile scenes.

622
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:51,904
Scott: You don't really have the.

623
00:45:52,406 --> 00:45:56,040
Scott: you know batwing action is a little bit of helicopter and motorcycle action.

624
00:45:56,563 --> 00:45:59,740
Rym: Almost all the action is in this comic is people talking to each other.

625
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:09,940
Scott: Yeah I mean all that classic Batman action of swinging on the things and jumping down on people with the cape out does go boo There's not too much of that going on.

626
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:13,010
Rym: And actually when there is you don't really pay attention to that.

627
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:24,798
Rym: you pay attention because he's basically going through in his head and kind Of explaining why he does everything He does like how why he appears in a certain way and all the psychology of how he controls people and makes.

628
00:46:24,879 --> 00:46:26,347
Scott: and also He's an old geezer.

629
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:28,380
Scott: He gets the shit kicked out of him constantly.

630
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,930
Scott: So you're most I'm mostly concentrating on when I read it.

631
00:46:31,272 --> 00:46:33,220
Scott: like all the pain Batman is suffering.

632
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,123
Scott: It's like this old geezer getting kicked around Constantly,

633
00:46:36,424 --> 00:46:50,150
Rym: but just the scene from when Superman goes to stop the new con Just the style of it and the way it's portrayed and just all that goes through Superman's head are the words 20 million die by fire if I am weak.

634
00:46:50,732 --> 00:46:58,538
Rym: Yep, and just that the way it's so perfect It's it's pretty much exactly how it would go epic it's saga it's it's just it's brilliant.

635
00:46:58,759 --> 00:46:58,900
Rym: Yep

636
00:46:59,362 --> 00:47:16,732
Scott: Plus I like how it shows like he sees sort of like Superman's powers are like just in the in the right because I know this in many different time periods, you know Many different Superman's because it's all crazy batshit, you know Superman's powers are at different levels and whatever, you know This is the original Superman could only actually jump.

637
00:47:16,772 --> 00:47:17,355
Scott: He couldn't fly.

638
00:47:17,395 --> 00:47:18,400
Scott: He just jumped really high.

639
00:47:18,722 --> 00:47:20,734
Scott: so it was like he was flying and you know, whatever.

640
00:47:21,278 --> 00:47:25,729
Scott: but This Superman like he's just right and that he can.

641
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:30,828
Scott: you know, if he's storming Gotham City to you know Take care of a bunch of criminals.

642
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,640
Scott: It's like whoosh and it's amazing.

643
00:47:33,161 --> 00:47:40,420
Scott: But if it's like fighting in the war, it's like he's actually sort of you know roughing it quite and you know fighting this nuke.

644
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:47,219
Scott: He just can't go and throw it into the Sun like yes happened in so many other Superman's where you take like a net Well, I think catch a bunch of nukes in it.

645
00:47:48,083 --> 00:47:52,860
Rym: Part of the idea of all this is that you know, the world is changing technology.

646
00:47:53,161 --> 00:48:06,840
Rym: You know, the world is becoming the modern world that we live in today, you know from the 80s you know early 90s kind of perspective, but you know, the idea is that the world is changing and Superman and Batman are not changing.

647
00:48:07,663 --> 00:48:15,668
Rym: So these two figures are having to cut and Gordon and all these other people from the old world are Still around and they're coping with this changing world.

648
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:19,960
Rym: and the world is catching up to Superman - it's not just catching up to Batman.

649
00:48:20,101 --> 00:48:24,938
Rym: The world is not what it was when Superman was doing his thing 40 years ago now.

650
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:26,742
Rym: Technology.

651
00:48:26,883 --> 00:48:36,709
Rym: Superman is not a god as much as you might expect him to be Yep, and I really don't want to talk about that anymore But you should read this comic series.

652
00:48:36,869 --> 00:48:38,134
Scott: Everyone's got to read this comic.

692
00:50:20,721 --> 00:50:28,774
Scott: Then you should get this and read it because reading it is Exact gives me exactly the same feeling as when I watch an amazing Batman movie.

693
00:50:29,195 --> 00:50:30,620
Scott: It's the exact same feeling in you.

694
00:50:31,081 --> 00:50:32,204
Scott: it's no different.

695
00:50:32,505 --> 00:50:50,505

697
00:50:53,295 --> 00:50:54,620
Rym: You know what everyone should read this?

698
00:50:54,941 --> 00:50:55,624
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

699
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:59,000

Scott: It's definitely I don't know what else to say important super important.

703
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:17,153
Scott: Like if there was a if there was a class in school that was like, you know studying, you know comics This would be on the reading list no matter what.

704
00:51:17,455 --> 00:51:20,235
Scott: Well, it had better be Else you're in the wrong class.

705
00:51:20,255 --> 00:51:27,265
Rym: All right I think that's enough of that because uh, it won't be too many days before the visigoths are here for the New Year's Extravaganza.

706
00:51:27,285 --> 00:51:28,859
Scott: I wonder how many visigoths have read this book.

707
00:51:29,781 --> 00:51:33,934
Scott: We'll make sure they've all read it so that they unvisigoth by just by reading it.

708
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:35,639
