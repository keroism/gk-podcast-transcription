1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,566
Rym: It's Tuesday, May 15th, 2012.

2
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:12,428
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,448 --> 00:00:13,069
Rym: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,934
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:17,560
Rym: Tonight, do you have the Buddha nature?

6
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:20,219
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,860
Rym: So I've been a pretty hardcore biker like my whole life.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:34,750
Rym: Like I've had, you know, from when I was a pretty young kid I got a real like 10-speed bike and then I got a mountain bike and I've been mountain biking and trail riding.

9
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,976
Rym: I mean, you know, relatively hardcore, right?

10
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:41,770
Scott: Because actually hardcore are those guys with the Lance Armstrong get-ups, right?

11
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:46,321
Rym: Well, Scott, there's other kinds of hardcore.

12
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:51,717
Rym: I mean, there's also the like hardcore like trick biker on those BMX's but it's almost like totally different class.

13
00:00:51,737 --> 00:00:52,560
Rym: Like you have to diverge.

14
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:58,037
Rym: You can't be hardcore Lance Armstrong and hardcore like downhill mountain biker.

15
00:00:58,077 --> 00:00:59,321
Scott: There are guys who are but...

16
00:00:59,902 --> 00:01:00,384
Rym: name one.

17
00:01:00,484 --> 00:01:00,725
Rym: Who?

18
00:01:00,745 --> 00:01:02,390
Scott: I'm sure there has to be somebody.

19
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,708
Scott: Right, but the point is, you know, we're like a step under that.

20
00:01:08,591 --> 00:01:12,190
Scott: Regardless of your direction, there's the matter of degree of hardcoreness.

21
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,950
Rym: I'm just saying relative to most people, like from a young age...

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,450
Scott: You are hard, yes, we are both harder core than the vast majority of people.

23
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,349
Rym: Yeah, I think I'm a lot harder core than you.

24
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:23,490
Rym: Yeah.

25
00:01:24,671 --> 00:01:27,550
Rym: Anyway, so I've been like I've been biking a lot.

26
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,070
Rym: Like I used to go biking, like mountain biking, almost every day after school and like middle school and high school.

27
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,150
Scott: In what mountains and flat as Detroit?

28
00:01:34,832 --> 00:01:39,710
Rym: Mountain biking also refers to like single track and track technical and trail riding and all that stuff.

29
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,094
Scott: Where were there?

30
00:01:40,115 --> 00:01:41,369
Scott: What tracks are you riding on?

31
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:47,870
Rym: You realize there's tracks in most of the woods and I didn't actually live in downtown Detroit by the time I was in middle school.

32
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:53,250
Rym: I lived in New Baltimore and then Sterling Heights where there's tons of single track trails.

33
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,733
Rym: But one thing, like trail and mountain biking, I never like.

34
00:01:56,773 --> 00:02:07,450
Rym: I knew there were clips, like toe clips, and I knew there were you know pedals that had built in clips, but I didn't know what that all was because I never did, like I never had a road bike or a street bike.

35
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,009
Scott: Because you weren't maximum hard core.

36
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:14,770
Rym: Well no, because I only did like trail riding and mountain biking and stuff, so I only had a mountain bike.

37
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,649
Scott: I'm pretty sure mountain bike guys have that too.

38
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:24,957
Rym: Yeah, so back then, basically all the people I rode with, none of them used that stuff because the people who taught me were like, "No, it's too dangerous.

39
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:26,003
Rym: You're better off just going for it.

40
00:02:26,043 --> 00:02:26,988
Rym: You only need those if you're...".

41
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,697
Rym: And they'd all list like a different list of reasons.

42
00:02:29,737 --> 00:02:33,989
Rym: you'd need clips or clipless, but their lists never matched up.

43
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:41,850
Rym: And I never really did like hardcore downhill, which is kind of separate, so I didn't really need like those special bikes or anything.

44
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,449
Rym: I always preferred like, you know, a hardtail mountain bike.

45
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,029
Rym: But, so clips never really factored in.

46
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:55,270
Rym: But now that I moved to the city, you know, I got my first street bike and I've been riding on streets and roads as opposed to in the woods.

47
00:02:56,592 --> 00:02:58,730
Rym: And it's a way different ballgame.

48
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,789
Rym: Like it took me a while to get used to not having a suspension, though I kind of like how much faster I can go.

49
00:03:05,412 --> 00:03:10,790
Rym: But I took the plunge and I got some clipless like SPD pedals and I got the fancy shoes and all that stuff and got them installed.

50
00:03:11,573 --> 00:03:17,667
Rym: And pretty much everyone on the internet and even in the bike shop, they're like, "Yeah, you're going to fall over at least like two times before you figure it

51
00:03:17,768 --> 00:03:17,868
Rym: out.".

52
00:03:18,794 --> 00:03:19,770
Rym: I haven't fallen over yet.

53
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,749
Scott: Yeah, I can't imagine you would fall over.

54
00:03:22,213 --> 00:03:23,221
Rym: So here's what they say.

55
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,914
Scott: You might be like,

56
00:03:24,934 --> 00:03:25,357
Scott: "Oops!"

57
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,050
Scott: and stop and stand on the ground.

58
00:03:27,954 --> 00:03:29,385
Rym: No, so stand on the ground.

59
00:03:29,405 --> 00:03:29,990
Rym: That's the problem.

60
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:34,710
Rym: Apparently what happens to most people when they use these sort of like clipless systems for the first time.

61
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,670
Scott: They get them both clipped in and they can't unclip and then they just fall over.

62
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,989
Rym: No, you forget to unclip right away.

63
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:44,025
Rym: Like you don't have the instinct of unclip before you come up to like a stop sign or like.

64
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:48,670
Rym: basically you get this instinct of whenever there's possibly trouble, you unclip a foot to be ready.

65
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:51,489
Rym: But if you don't have that instinct, like say you're riding, right?

66
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,949
Rym: And say you suddenly come to a stop or you just come to a stop and you weren't really thinking about it.

67
00:03:56,792 --> 00:04:06,010
Rym: If you're clipped in and you lose all forward momentum, it is too late to continue pedaling and usually it's too late to actually clip out in time.

68
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:18,790
Rym: And what one website described, the exact words were, You will have what I can only refer to as the most ungraceful and doofy looking accident anyone will ever see.

69
00:04:19,671 --> 00:04:28,850
Rym: To the outsider, it will appear as though you are falling over in slow motion due to your own stupidity, when in fact there is nothing in the world you could do to arrest your fall.

70
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:35,970
Scott: I can definitely imagine both seeing this thing from seeing someone else do this and also being victim of it.

71
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,590
Scott: I can imagine it in its fullness.

72
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:43,173
Rym: It almost happened once where I was stopping and I was almost at a stop and I was thinking like, "Gonna unclip, gonna

73
00:04:43,273 --> 00:04:43,695
Rym: unclip.".

74
00:04:44,056 --> 00:04:46,705
Rym: But I was also thinking, "I can kinda wait.

75
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:47,488
Rym: I think I got

76
00:04:47,528 --> 00:04:47,749
Rym: this.".

77
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:53,370
Rym: And then I came to a complete stop and I started to unclip and I couldn't get it out right away.

78
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,049
Rym: And I started to lean a little bit and then I felt it.

79
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,210
Rym: And once you're falling over and you are clipped in, you're fucked.

80
00:05:01,652 --> 00:05:01,890
Rym: Too late.

81
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,689
Rym: No, I got my foot out and I still...

82
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,879
Scott: Beyond the point of no return.

83
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,110
Scott: The center of gravity is open.

84
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,932
Rym: I got my foot out.

85
00:05:07,013 --> 00:05:12,830
Rym: I was like one degree to the right from being past that event horizon and being that guy.

86
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,487
Rym: But even the bike shop guy was like, "Yeah, you're gonna fall over a

87
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:15,709
Rym: bunch.".

88
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,650
Rym: But so far I haven't and I'm really proud of that.

89
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,470
Scott: See, the thing is, right, is I know for a fact that if I got that, I would be so conscious of it.

90
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,250
Scott: Like it would be, you know, I would be paying attention to it so much.

91
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,407
Scott: I might get into an accident from something else, right?

92
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,009
Scott: Like I'd be paying attention, like my feet are attached.

93
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:35,150
Scott: I'd just bump into a car, who knows what, or get doored or whatever, right?

94
00:05:35,491 --> 00:05:40,710
Scott: But I would be so conscious of it early on that I wouldn't fuck it up because I'd be so much paying attention to it.

95
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:47,990
Scott: And then after that period of so much paying attention to it, it would become reflex before I would stop paying attention to it.

96
00:05:48,311 --> 00:06:00,870
Scott: So the only risk is if there's an in-between period where I'm not... It's not quite 100% motor reflex yet, but I've done it enough that I'm not super paying attention to it all the time.

97
00:06:01,193 --> 00:06:01,263
Scott: Yep.

98
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:02,668
Scott: And that's the danger zone.

99
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:03,467
Rym: Now I do.

100
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:08,027
Scott: Not when you're first using it, but when you're sort of getting used to it, but not 100% yet.

101
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:13,950
Rym: I would recommend getting them because now that I'm riding with them, and I was using toe clips before, and even that was a huge improvement.

102
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:15,329
Scott: I'm not a fan of toe clips.

103
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:15,948
Rym: Well, here's the thing.

104
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,790
Rym: Toe clips, one, when I was a punk kid, too, I couldn't afford like a clipless system.

105
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,989
Rym: Also, that was, you know, 20 years ago when I started doing this stuff.

106
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:27,630
Rym: But toe clips, mountain biking, are a death warrant.

107
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,730
Scott: I think they're a death warrant, period.

108
00:06:30,312 --> 00:06:32,209
Scott: I've been using them in the city up to this point.

109
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,489
Scott: If you see track biking, they're okay.

110
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:33,963
Rym: No!

111
00:06:34,572 --> 00:06:35,208
Rym: No, no, no, no.

112
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,506
Rym: They're okay in the city, I would say.

113
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,709
Rym: They're not okay in the woods because, one, if you...

114
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,210
Scott: I mean, in the velodrome, they're okay.

115
00:06:42,331 --> 00:06:42,950
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

116
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,550
Rym: Yeah, but when I think track, I think like single track, like, you know, those two inch trails in the woods.

117
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,310
Scott: I'm saying on the circle where the guys are trying to not go on their fixies.

118
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,489
Rym: Yeah, the kind of biking I would do.

119
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:52,290
Rym: That's track biking.

120
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:52,948
Rym: Like in the woods?

121
00:06:53,171 --> 00:06:56,650
Rym: All right, so I pull my foot out of the toe clip, and I ride on the back.

122
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,430
Rym: Now I've got this basket that's just waiting to catch a tree.

123
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,169
Scott: Exactly.

124
00:07:02,491 --> 00:07:06,470
Rym: Yeah, but it's like night and day in terms of like speed.

125
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:07,589
Scott: I tire myself out faster.

126
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,210
Scott: Well, first of all, you know that your foot is always in the right spot.

127
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:10,542
Rym: Yup.

128
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,570
Scott: You also, when you're biking, you're forced to pull up, right?

129
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,648
Scott: You don't have to like, you know, bend and sort of curve your foot to sort of get some pulling up going on.

130
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:22,929
Scott: So that muscle that does the up pulling is now getting worked all the time as you're pedaling.

131
00:07:23,452 --> 00:07:24,450
Scott: And you're going way faster.

132
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,685
Rym: I find I tire faster, but I'm going a lot faster while I'm tiring faster, and it's a net gain.

133
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:34,010
Scott: I would get them, but I would only get them if I had the fancy kind of road bike.

134
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:36,190
Scott: I wouldn't put them on a non-road bike.

135
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,770
Rym: Just get them, and you can just take pedals off.

136
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,889
Rym: Like I got my old pedals.

137
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,910
Rym: You can just swap pedals between bikes.

138
00:07:43,493 --> 00:07:44,989
Scott: I still, I don't think it's worth it.

139
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:49,230
Scott: It's like, it's like, yeah, it's like putting a big fancy engine in sort of a boring car.

140
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:52,690
Rym: It's like, I'm thinking about getting them for my old mountain bike now.

141
00:07:53,392 --> 00:07:54,268
Scott: Yeah, I'm not doing it.

142
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,610
Rym: Well, you don't have an old mountain bike.

143
00:07:55,871 --> 00:08:03,870
Scott: Even if I did, I would only get them if I had, you know, the, the, you know, the road Tour de France style hooked handlebar lean forward kind of bike.

144
00:08:03,931 --> 00:08:05,310
Scott: Then I would absolutely get them.

145
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:05,750
Scott: No question.

146
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:10,909
Rym: The other big thing they save you from that I have never done to myself, but I might get that kind of bike.

147
00:08:11,272 --> 00:08:12,790
Rym: Do it is mountain biking.

148
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:24,949
Rym: If you're going like long distance, like an overland, like this long thing, you get kind of fatigued and it's really easy to just kind of be tired when you're like going on a straightaway and your foot will just like slip off the pedal right into the wheel at the back.

149
00:08:25,452 --> 00:08:26,249
Scott: That never happens to me.

150
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:31,449
Rym: Yeah, because you haven't tried riding like if you ride a very long distance, it's actually a fairly common accident to happen.

151
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,767
Rym: And clipless systems prevent that.

152
00:08:34,712 --> 00:08:36,129
Rym: So I'm digging these things.

153
00:08:37,455 --> 00:08:38,390
Rym: That's all I can say about it.

154
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:43,370
Rym: I didn't get multi-release because research said that that's basically stupid.

155
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,429
Scott: What is multi-release?

156
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,910
Rym: So you can unclip.

157
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,190
Scott: Do you unclip by twisting your kicking your heel out to the side?

158
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:50,430
Rym: Out to the left or right.

159
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,750
Scott: So away from the bike.

160
00:08:53,373 --> 00:08:53,889
Rym: Multi-release.

161
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,889
Scott: You don't kick your heel towards the bike.

162
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,430
Rym: Multi-release.

163
00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:02,209
Rym: You can clip in both directions or you can do a maneuver to clip straight up, but you have to use enough force to get off.

164
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,569
Rym: So it gives you more options out.

165
00:09:04,354 --> 00:09:04,544
Scott: Yeah.

166
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:08,830
Rym: Multi-release appears to be used more for mountain biking kind of clips.

167
00:09:09,337 --> 00:09:09,810
Rym: And there's all these.

168
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,090
Rym: I learned a whole bunch about this stuff.

169
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:11,629
Scott: I did my research.

170
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,409
Scott: I researched it as well.

171
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,209
Scott: There's the kind, the SPD is pretty much the one to get.

172
00:09:15,418 --> 00:09:15,550
Scott: Yeah.

173
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,210
Scott: Don't get anything else.

174
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,289
Scott: That's the one that built that they can, you can put that on any normal shoe.

175
00:09:19,631 --> 00:09:22,290
Scott: Well, any, there's like a, you know, normal looking shoes, right?

176
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:29,510
Scott: Like they have dress shoes that have SPD brackets on them and you can actually walk around right with an SPD clip in the shoe.

177
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:39,310
Scott: If the shoe has enough soul that it goes lower than the clip, which is a lot, you know, you could also get one where the clip sort of sticks out a little bit and you can't walk around too much, but you can still kind of walk around.

178
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:39,457
Scott: Yeah.

179
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,110
Rym: For my kind of riding, those are stupid.

180
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,810
Scott: But there's the non SPD one.

181
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,470
Scott: Well, there's like a big bracket.

182
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:46,488
Scott: There's a couple of old ones.

183
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:50,626
Scott: I see guys in the city with these, so they have these giant brackets on the bottom of the shoe.

184
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:57,046
Rym: Which says that not only are most other systems worse or dangerous, but many of them are bad for you.

185
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:03,549
Scott: It's like, it's like the old fashioned clipless system is like, there's a gigantic bracket on the bottom of your shoe.

186
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,770
Scott: You can't really walk at all, you know, and it's a special, it's only on a special shoe.

187
00:10:08,951 --> 00:10:10,669
Scott: And it's like, yeah, who wants that?

188
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,230
Scott: You know, maybe if you still have it from the olden days.

189
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,351
Scott: Well, I

190
00:10:12,371 --> 00:10:28,330
Rym: realize the play is important because one used to mountain biking so much, what I realized I do that I never noticed until I started, until I started riding like this is that I tend to twist my, like I stand up a lot and I tend to twist my torso around a lot, like to the side, especially around corners.

191
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,470
Rym: And it's kind of a like mountain bike-y thing that you don't need to do in the city.

192
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:37,128
Rym: But now that I'm clipped in, like I notice every time I do it, cause my foot can't move that way.

193
00:10:37,573 --> 00:10:37,664
Scott: Yup.

194
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:38,287
Scott: Yeah.

195
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,090
Scott: I don't, I try not to stand up unless absolutely necessary.

196
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:41,350
Scott: Yeah.

197
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,456
Rym: Well it's a different kind of like.

198
00:10:42,717 --> 00:10:45,890
Rym: standing up on a mountain bike is basically a suspension if you have a hard tail.

199
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:51,369
Scott: Like if there's a big hill, I got to downshift so I can stay sitting while going up the hill rather than stand up and go, eh, eh, eh.

200
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,170
Rym: But like, like, you know, mountain biking, you're going over a really rough terrain.

201
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,270
Rym: You stand up to go over the rough terrain.

202
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,570
Scott: Because otherwise the seat is going to kick your ass.

203
00:10:59,051 --> 00:11:00,130
Rym: Unless you have a full suspension.

204
00:11:00,351 --> 00:11:03,430
Rym: And I actually still prefer hard tails to full suspensions.

205
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:07,950
Rym: Granted, I don't do, you know, like crazy, like downhill on a ski slope.

206
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,710
Scott: Oh, so you're not the hardest core is what you're saying.

207
00:11:10,953 --> 00:11:12,130
Rym: I never said I was the hardest core.

208
00:11:12,311 --> 00:11:12,649
Scott: I'm just saying.

209
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,070
Rym: I'm a pretty hardcore biker though.

210
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,966
Scott: Okay.

211
00:11:16,493 --> 00:11:16,949
Rym: So what do you got?

212
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,689
Rym: It's news day.

213
00:11:18,173 --> 00:11:18,343
Scott: News day.

214
00:11:18,613 --> 00:11:19,590
Scott: So check this news out.

215
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:28,310
Scott: So Portal 2 is coming out with this thing called Perpetual Testing Initiative, which is a way for you to make your own portal test chambers.

216
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:35,407
Scott: And the thing is, there have been many FPS map makers in the past, all the way back to ZDoom, even Wolfenstein 3D.

217
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:36,868
Scott: You could make your own maps.

218
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,083
Rym: Yeah.

219
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:43,970
Scott: But when things got 3D, when things got Quake, when things got Half-Life and they had tools like what was it called?

220
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:44,730
Scott: Hammer or something?

221
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:45,150
Rym: Yeah.

222
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:53,230
Rym: Well, I mean, I used to mod the other ever living crap out of like, you know, the unreal maps I had to redo and de-hacked and wadded and all that stuff.

223
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,250
Scott: Even NS2 has some really good map making tools.

224
00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:01,470
Scott: But all these tools for making, you know, FPS maps are difficult tools right there.

225
00:12:01,771 --> 00:12:05,770
Scott: You have to spend a lot of time learning them and fiddling with them and you learn to apply textures.

226
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:06,630
Rym: Well, here's the difference.

227
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:13,210
Rym: It took me a few weeks to learn in my spare time to learn how to make like complex Doom maps.

228
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:14,028
Rym: And this is Doom.

229
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:14,577
Rym: This isn't real 3D.

230
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,086
Scott: This is Doom.

231
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:22,489
Rym: And so, but it meant I could casually make mods for Doom and levels for Doom while doing other things.

232
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,090
Rym: But most of the people I know of who make like Half-Life, like Counter-Strike maps.

233
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,588
Rym: That's it.

234
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:30,209
Rym: That is their hobby.

235
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,189
Rym: Singular.

236
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,849
Scott: Because it's, you know, it's all you get so hard.

237
00:12:34,214 --> 00:12:35,330
Scott: You have to it's like a whole set.

238
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:35,894
Scott: You get to get.

239
00:12:35,914 --> 00:12:37,550
Scott: it's why like level editor is a job.

240
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:46,870
Scott: As an aside, if you learn to like make maps for the unreal engine, you got a job for life because, you know, the same way that a guy who learns like AutoCAD is a job for life.

241
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,390
Scott: Anyone who needs someone who can work, you know, I have an aside, Scott, that you'll appreciate.

242
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,410
Rym: We all want to get this out there.

243
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:59,250
Rym: If any of you listeners feel like you could take an old Counter-Strike one six map called CS Thunder.

244
00:13:00,092 --> 00:13:02,390
Rym: It's not the one that's called CS Thunder and source.

245
00:13:02,511 --> 00:13:04,990
Rym: It doesn't exist in source CS underscore Thunder.

246
00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:09,970
Rym: It was perhaps the best Counter-Strike map ever made.

247
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:10,790
Scott: At least our favorite.

248
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:11,183
Rym: Yes.

249
00:13:11,913 --> 00:13:16,692
Rym: Because it had this great well, I digress as to why I could do a whole show on why that we should get.

250
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:21,625
Rym: make a server that only runs Thunder and the version of one six that supports it is state.

251
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,829
Rym: Oh, it's all assault, which assault is a couple of assaults.

252
00:13:27,552 --> 00:13:30,070
Rym: Oh, no, no, no, no, not assault, not assault oil rig.

253
00:13:30,652 --> 00:13:32,287
Rym: I want I want that APC.

254
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:34,489
Rym: I want vehicles back.

255
00:13:36,013 --> 00:13:37,130
Scott: What's your mansion?

256
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:44,790
Scott: Jeepathon 2K, Jeepathon 2K, you know, just only the crazy, wait a minute, wait a bit more.

257
00:13:45,716 --> 00:13:46,605
Scott: Oh, Arab.

258
00:13:47,955 --> 00:13:48,308
Rym: I'll bet.

259
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,889
Rym: You know what?

260
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,830
Rym: I'm going to check after the show because CS one six is played as much as CS source.

261
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,850
Rym: There's got to be a server on a jeepathon.

262
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,629
Rym: And if there is, I'm going to play on it fucking tonight.

263
00:13:58,456 --> 00:13:58,987
Scott: Good luck with that.

264
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:00,675
Rym: But I digress.

265
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:04,050
Rym: if you can make that map in CS source or CS go, I'll pay you.

266
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:12,070
Scott: This portal map maker is is looking is so brain dead easy that anyone can do it because it portal only has so many elements, right?

267
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:23,169
Scott: So it's really easy for them to provide you with this other user interface where just sort of you lay tiles, you know, and you put like, OK, a bumper there and a companion cube there and a automatic portal there.

268
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:28,045
Scott: And, you know, so and to make test chambers, you know, put the exit here, put the entrance here.

269
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:28,850
Scott: Right.

270
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:34,430
Scott: They provide an easy user interface to building a test chamber and then it automatically generates the map based on that.

271
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,589
Rym: So I haven't read much about it yet.

272
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,848
Rym: So I have a question for you that I don't know if you can answer because I don't know if it's known.

273
00:14:39,831 --> 00:14:44,950
Rym: And I have a a proposal for what I would do making maps if I were a dick.

274
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,529
Scott: Impossible to win maps.

275
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:51,510
Rym: No, I would make maps that are impossible, but seem so possible.

276
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,550
Rym: So this is like it's your fault that you're not making right.

277
00:14:54,630 --> 00:15:00,687
Scott: Here's the thing about this is that it's really hard to make a good test chamber.

278
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:06,470
Scott: crazy hard because a good test chamber, right, is one that is possible, right.

279
00:15:07,571 --> 00:15:13,110
Scott: But not trivial, but is not obvious either.

280
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,363
Scott: Right.

281
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,028
Scott: It's like Dixie.

282
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,970
Scott: You can't be obvious, but you can't be impossible.

283
00:15:17,138 --> 00:15:17,290
Scott: Right.

284
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,569
Scott: You need someone to get.

285
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,930
Rym: I mean, even Portal two sort of suffered, in my opinion, for me as a gamer.

286
00:15:23,051 --> 00:15:28,910
Rym: Note, I'm qualifying because parts of the fact that you obvious the whole second half of the game was no thought.

287
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,910
Rym: I'd literally no matter what the puzzle was, I'd ignore the puzzle.

288
00:15:32,371 --> 00:15:34,990
Rym: I look around the room and there's any angled surface.

289
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:38,970
Rym: I would assume that was the answer and just accelerate into a portal coming off of that.

290
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,190
Rym: And that always worked right in the co-op.

291
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,406
Scott: I think there was one that took us a little while to figure out.

292
00:15:44,771 --> 00:15:52,630
Scott: And the other thing in Portal is in addition to the puzzle solving, there's the acrobatic component, which is like, OK, it's you know what to do, but can you do it?

293
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,090
Rym: There's a third element of timing puzzles.

294
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:55,790
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

295
00:15:56,152 --> 00:15:57,010
Rym: That's the acrobatic component.

296
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:01,528
Rym: I would say they're separate because there's the acrobatics of for of your own personal timing.

297
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:06,190
Rym: Like, do I have to, like, fall through multiple portals and shoot somewhere else?

298
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:11,350
Scott: Shoot the cube, then jump through the portal at the right time and make sure you can make the jump and grab the cube in midair.

299
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,750
Rym: But there's another kind of puzzle.

300
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:17,310
Rym: Remember those the spheres of light in the Portal one where you might have to time it.

301
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:23,269
Rym: where it's there's an element independent of you, like a rotating door or something you have to time against.

302
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:24,230
Scott: Right.

303
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,490
Rym: But anyway, I consider them two separate aspects.

304
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:38,938
Scott: The reason there are so few puzzles in Portal one and two is because using only the elements that they had available to them, right, is only it's really hard to come up with another puzzle that's actually good.

305
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,770
Scott: so that they had noticed that as they get later in the game, you know, it's like, why didn't they add another one?

306
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:50,690
Scott: Well, they really couldn't until they introduced the goop and the paint because they ran out of good puzzles using only cubes and buttons.

307
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:52,329
Scott: So they had to add the paint in there.

308
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:56,550
Scott: And then once they added the paint was like, well, we can only come up with so many using the paint.

309
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,270
Scott: We need to add something else in order to come up with more puzzles.

310
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:11,170
Scott: So using only the elements that currently exist, you know, and having only these amateurs make new test chambers, I am incredibly both skeptical and excited.

311
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:20,829
Scott: I'm excited for I know there's going to be at least a few really good test chambers that come out of this, but I'm skeptical because I know most of the test chambers that come out of this is going to be absolutely worthless.

312
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:28,249
Rym: The other trouble is that easily two thirds of my enjoyment of portal is from the humor, which won't be there in these.

313
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:32,690
Scott: I mean, unless I think there will be some in like, you know, parts of it, but not really.

314
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:32,966
Rym: Yeah.

315
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,550
Rym: Like unless I can script like add wave files.

316
00:17:36,071 --> 00:17:39,609
Scott: It's like, is it going to let, I don't think it's going to let people make like a whole campaign.

317
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:43,748
Scott: It's only going to let people make a test chamber and then like share your test chambers with your friends.

318
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,750
Rym: And I'll admit I haven't looked into it at all because I've been busy playing other games.

319
00:17:47,111 --> 00:17:57,390
Rym: But what I'm curious if they'll do, because some of the old doom editors had things that would tell you if something was possible or not for a player who wasn't cheating.

320
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,690
Scott: How can something be impossible in doom unless there's like a key door and you haven't put the red key yet.

321
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:06,570
Rym: You can trivially make things that are impossible to get past.

322
00:18:06,671 --> 00:18:07,046
Scott: How so?

323
00:18:07,731 --> 00:18:08,650
Rym: Uh, you can make a stairway.

324
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,370
Rym: You just can't go down.

325
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,590
Rym: And that's the only path to the exit.

326
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:11,869
Scott: Yeah.

327
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:14,310
Scott: But that's just, that's like I said, there's just an obstruction.

328
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:15,750
Scott: That's it's really easy.

329
00:18:15,851 --> 00:18:17,108
Rym: You could make a lava pit.

330
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,982
Scott: Any basic pathfinding algorithm can determine if it's impossible to get from point A to point B.

331
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,730
Rym: Yes, it's a little complicated though.

332
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:24,876
Scott: Portal is, is, is.

333
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:31,530
Scott: you can't really have a, you know, a thing that does that because it's like, well, okay, so to get from point A to point B, there's a door that needs to open.

334
00:18:31,872 --> 00:18:33,170
Scott: There's a button that controls the door.

335
00:18:33,251 --> 00:18:34,149
Scott: What can push the button?

336
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:41,709
Scott: It would be a ludicrously difficult problem to come up with a program that could determine if a test chamber was solvable.

337
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:47,373
Rym: Or be much more interesting problem for someone who was interested in this sort of thing to try and solve

338
00:18:47,413 --> 00:18:48,035
Scott: because

339
00:18:48,095 --> 00:19:01,330
Rym: the number of elements of harmony are constrained and the physics are very well known and the, you know, there's so many constraints that one, you could come up with a sort of brute force thing that would run around.

340
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:23,429
Rym: Like it spawns a million dudes who go in every possible direction or two, you could have a sort of best guess algorithm that could figure out, I wonder if someone could make a thing for a small map that would be able to determine if it's possible at all or impossible and then a secondary threshold of if it's possible without quote ridiculous timing and or acrobatics.

341
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,850
Scott: I think, you know, my idea, I've got one idea for a chamber, right?

342
00:19:27,252 --> 00:19:29,830
Scott: And basically the idea for this chamber, it's very loose idea.

343
00:19:30,231 --> 00:19:35,345
Scott: And I think it's the only hope I have of making a good chamber is you got to open the exit door.

344
00:19:35,893 --> 00:19:37,910
Scott: You also got to get to the exit door, right?

345
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,110
Scott: This is sort of the fundamental thing in portal, right?

346
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:43,826
Scott: So I'm going to make it to where it's sort of obvious.

347
00:19:43,926 --> 00:19:45,628
Scott: you can just go boom, boom, boom, and it'll open the door.

348
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:50,651
Scott: But if you do that obvious way of opening the door, you won't be able to get to the door.

349
00:19:51,395 --> 00:19:54,209
Scott: And if you do the obvious way, it'll be really easy to get to the door.

350
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:58,571
Scott: But if you do that obvious way of getting to the door, you won't be able to open the door.

351
00:19:58,952 --> 00:20:04,150
Scott: And there'll be a non obvious way of doing both simultaneously.

352
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:13,409
Rym: I kind of want to go more the route of making something really sort of like puzzle in the sense of find the secret doors.

353
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,615
Scott: Well, that's the other thing.

354
00:20:14,998 --> 00:20:25,226
Scott: It's the other idea I had that I realized is kind of a bleh idea because it would be sort of easy is make your test chamber kind of crazy and maze like and like you got to, you know, find the hidden spot.

355
00:20:25,286 --> 00:20:26,431
Scott: that doesn't look quite right.

356
00:20:26,452 --> 00:20:31,497
Scott: Shoot a portal there, get into the secret porn room, and that's where the cube is that you need to get through that.

357
00:20:31,518 --> 00:20:36,149
Scott: You know, so it's like people would just be sitting there like, ah, and eventually find it.

358
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:42,370
Rym: Well, what I would do is make one like that and then publicize it as the impossible one and dare people to send you a video of them beating it.

359
00:20:42,551 --> 00:20:44,090
Scott: And a guy is going to beat in five seconds.

360
00:20:44,211 --> 00:20:44,694
Rym: Oh, exactly.

361
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:48,397
Scott: But because he's going to look at the map file and he's going to say, oh, there's a room there.

362
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:50,170
Scott: Yeah, and he's going to look around.

363
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:50,853
Scott: He's going to see it.

364
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:56,564
Scott: And I mean, if you if I gave that to you, you would find it in like no time because it's not like you can make something.

365
00:20:56,584 --> 00:20:58,456
Scott: that's, you know, a completely sealed room.

366
00:20:58,557 --> 00:20:58,678
Scott: Right.

367
00:20:58,698 --> 00:21:00,229
Scott: Because there's no way to shoot the portal into it.

368
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:01,013
Scott: Right.

369
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:05,110
Scott: It would have to be, you know, like a far away distant thing that's very tiny.

370
00:21:05,311 --> 00:21:08,789
Scott: But you would notice it because you would be like, maybe I'll go the route of making a straight up maze.

371
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,209
Scott: Yeah, but any maze you would find it by always going left.

372
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:15,729
Rym: You, Scott, you can construct mazes where that does not work.

373
00:21:16,631 --> 00:21:16,973
Scott: Really?

374
00:21:16,993 --> 00:21:19,390
Rym: I could show you some examples.

375
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:23,969
Rym: There are ways to make mazes where the left or right always rule will trap you in a loop.

376
00:21:24,635 --> 00:21:26,129
Rym: that'll never touch the solution.

377
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:28,329
Rym: It's trivial to make a maze like that.

378
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:40,906
Scott: Maybe you should make a maze like that where the left we're going always left traps you in a loop, going always right, traps you in a loop and, you know, going a certain if you go the right way, which is neither always going left or always should have

379
00:21:40,927 --> 00:21:41,852
Rym: said the correct way.

380
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:45,750
Scott: If you go the correct way, that won't actually bring you to the goal.

381
00:21:46,252 --> 00:21:48,990
Scott: It'll just along that correct path.

382
00:21:49,531 --> 00:21:54,710
Scott: There is a spot where you can see a place to portal that will get you to the right spot.

383
00:21:54,811 --> 00:21:57,750
Scott: So even and it won't be at the very end of the correct path.

384
00:21:58,132 --> 00:22:00,730
Scott: It'll be somewhere else along the correct path.

385
00:22:01,234 --> 00:22:02,003
Scott: And you might miss it.

386
00:22:03,632 --> 00:22:07,229
Scott: Now you can see why this is difficult, but I'm excited to see what happens with this.

387
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:15,521
Rym: So in other more rumor news, there's an article a while ago that Valve was reportedly working on a steam box game console.

388
00:22:15,763 --> 00:22:17,170
Scott: that's been a rumor for a zillion years.

389
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:27,874
Rym: Yeah, but there was a recent iteration of it in March and there was another more recent article from April talking about how Valve is straight up trying to hire hardware developers.

390
00:22:28,256 --> 00:22:29,443
Scott: Well, they could be making anything.

391
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:30,590
Rym: they could be making anything.

392
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:36,710
Rym: But the second one put forth a wave of speculation speculation.

393
00:22:37,911 --> 00:23:00,870
Rym: So I think it's interesting because Valve is one of the few companies like I can count on one hand the number of companies in the world that I generally trust to do the things I want personally and have, if not my own best interest in mind, at least a personal self-serving interest that will also serve my own personal interests.

394
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:01,431
Scott: That's right.

395
00:23:02,234 --> 00:23:06,952
Rym: Valve also is a pretty great company, it appears in light of their employee handbook.

396
00:23:07,133 --> 00:23:10,448
Scott: Yeah, apparently there was a small interview with Gabe Newell.

397
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:19,490
Scott: He and in that interview, he, A, basically admitted that that policy of the flat company was a direct reaction to his time at Microsoft.

398
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,574
Scott: He wanted to do the opposite.

399
00:23:21,176 --> 00:23:24,870
Scott: And B, he 100 percent just said he likes My Little Pony.

400
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:25,696
Scott: Friendship is Magic.

401
00:23:26,562 --> 00:23:27,670
Rym: That's a good sign of a good person.

402
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,808
Scott: Because we knew that for a while, but he just said it straight up.

403
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,452
Scott: So there you go.

404
00:23:32,974 --> 00:23:41,710
Rym: So all this together, I want to just kind of take an aside to talk about something that I'd said a long time ago on the show, like many years ago.

405
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:50,850
Rym: But I think the consoles as we know them today have to die and it won't be that long.

406
00:23:51,251 --> 00:24:05,370
Rym: Well, but the thing is, the reason it might not happen is that Microsoft actually holds all the cards here, not so much the other console developers and not so much people like Valve, because Valve could make their own thing.

407
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,313
Rym: I mean, you know, the rumor was Valve is going to make a set top box, which would be great.

408
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,207
Rym: Valve should do something like that.

409
00:24:12,455 --> 00:24:12,698
Scott: Maybe.

410
00:24:13,042 --> 00:24:13,447
Rym: I think so.

411
00:24:14,131 --> 00:24:28,630
Rym: But Microsoft is the one who way back before the Xbox even was saying that they wanted to make video game consoles be a commodity hardware because they thought they would all run Windows, which Windows is still really the only way to play games right now.

412
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,131
Scott: That's right.

413
00:24:29,694 --> 00:24:33,650
Rym: But so Microsoft had a vested interest in that.

414
00:24:33,831 --> 00:24:39,275
Rym: And everyone who plays games called the idiots and like really defended the virtues of consoles.

415
00:24:39,315 --> 00:24:40,790
Rym: Now, Microsoft is trying to be evil.

416
00:24:40,871 --> 00:24:42,509
Rym: And it was this whole stupid argument.

417
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:47,210
Rym: PlayStation, I don't see any future for their hardware.

418
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,390
Scott: Nintendo is not in this country.

419
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,050
Rym: Nintendo posted losses like big losses.

420
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,010
Rym: Nintendo's run into a lot of trouble.

421
00:24:54,250 --> 00:25:07,710
Scott: I heard a rumor that Nintendo and also sort of based on information from like a Nintendo financial report or something or quarterly report that they're actually going to bring that they've been selling the 3DS like a low price and they're going to bring the price back up.

422
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,078
Rym: I saw that rumor.

423
00:25:09,098 --> 00:25:10,350
Rym: I don't think it'll actually happen.

424
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,808
Scott: That is crazy.

425
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,941
Scott: Bringing the price up.

426
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:17,190
Rym: It's like, whoa, we could do a show on Nintendo.

427
00:25:18,191 --> 00:25:18,894
Rym: What the fuck?

428
00:25:19,055 --> 00:25:23,770
Scott: The thing is, like, you know, Scott, remember GeekNights circa 2005.

429
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:30,870
Rym: I remember we did a show and then we said, yeah, we're like, Nintendo is the champion of everything at the time.

430
00:25:30,951 --> 00:25:31,395
Scott: It was true.

431
00:25:31,516 --> 00:25:32,829
Rym: PC gaming is dead.

432
00:25:33,511 --> 00:25:35,490
Scott: It was at the time very dying.

433
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:36,789
Rym: Let's see what was going on at the time.

434
00:25:37,212 --> 00:25:37,577
Rym: Oh, right.

435
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:38,390
Rym: Game Cube.

436
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:39,373
Scott: Yeah.

437
00:25:39,594 --> 00:25:42,790
Scott: You know, we was coming and we actually believed it was going to be revolution.

438
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,870
Scott: The DS was the king of everything.

439
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,773
Rym: But it's an aside.

440
00:25:45,853 --> 00:25:46,415
Rym: Nintendo.

441
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:59,170
Rym: basically, to avoid doing an entire show on this, Nintendo turned its back on the so-called, I hate this term because it's a useless term, but the hardcore gamers, like super serial gamers like us.

442
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:04,833
Scott: The thing is, Nintendo, if they would just change their ways, they could reconquer the world so fast.

443
00:26:05,115 --> 00:26:06,742
Scott: All they just do is be like, Pokemon MMO, right?

444
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:09,710
Scott: That's number one, right?

445
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,910
Rym: Number one, that would do it.

446
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:13,110
Rym: They could make a company that was just the Pokemon MMO.

447
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:13,615
Rym: They already do.

448
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:14,910
Scott: It's called the Pokemon Corporation.

449
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,629
Rym: Yeah, but that company made the MMO.

450
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:22,673
Scott: But number two, just open up, be like, hey, anyone who wants to can make games for Nintendo systems.

451
00:26:22,694 --> 00:26:25,170
Scott: We're removing all our DRMs, indie developers.

452
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,082
Scott: We don't care who it is.

453
00:26:26,931 --> 00:26:28,609
Scott: Anyone who wants to can make a Nintendo game.

454
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:29,949
Rym: It couldn't be just that anymore.

455
00:26:31,511 --> 00:26:39,550
Rym: So Nintendo turned its back on the Four Swords, Crystal Chronicles, experimental hardware, Game Boy, Link Cube stuff to target.

456
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:42,110
Scott: Well, they want to do the Wii U, which is going back to that.

457
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:48,948
Rym: Let me finish, to target the Blue Ocean, which was so-called, again, terrible term, casual gamers and mommies and all that.

458
00:26:49,670 --> 00:27:01,550
Rym: But they targeted them by still selling them expensive games, which was also where all the money was on the DS and the Game Boy Advance and everything.

459
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:09,310
Rym: But that meant that the next wave of gaming, like smartphones and Angry Birds, is they're.

460
00:27:09,492 --> 00:27:11,369
Rym: basically they did the thing that you should never do.

461
00:27:11,993 --> 00:27:14,689
Rym: They went toe to toe with the dollar games.

462
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:19,710
Rym: We used to say, yeah, Zynga, that doesn't compete with, you know, what we consider games.

463
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:20,610
Rym: They're barely a game company.

464
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,427
Scott: Nintendo is trying to sell you Angry Birds for 50 bucks.

465
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:23,327
Scott: It's not going to work.

466
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:23,770
Rym: Yeah.

467
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:39,035
Rym: So Nintendo basically went after a demographic and then got creamed in that demographic while simultaneously literally abandoning the people who would give them hundreds of dollars sight unseen for a console that might fail, that has one game available.

468
00:27:39,055 --> 00:27:40,930
Rym: I bought the DS.

469
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,390
Rym: Literally knowing nothing about it, day one.

470
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,129
Scott: Well, we had the Virtual Boy strategy.

471
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:46,891
Scott: Yeah.

472
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:53,329
Scott: The thing is, I'm actually there's enough games in the 3DS that it's almost something I want to wait for the 3DS Lite for.

473
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:53,871
Rym: Right.

474
00:27:53,952 --> 00:27:57,750
Scott: But even then, it's like I have so many games already.

475
00:27:58,853 --> 00:27:58,913
Scott: Why?

476
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:03,550
Scott: You know, it's like even though there's some games in the 3DS I kind of want and they're supposed to be like a Phoenix, right?

477
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,769
Scott: That's going to be 3DS only and stuff like that.

478
00:28:07,111 --> 00:28:14,762
Scott: It's like even though there's maybe enough games in there, the cost of it, even at the low price now, is not worth it.

479
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:19,750
Scott: They have to pump it up so much more to make me pay for it.

480
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:30,447
Rym: But for Nintendo, it's not just open up, but it's open up with what the GameCube had, have hardware like the Game Boy Link thing or connecting 3DS's to a Wii.

481
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:31,491
Rym: Right.

482
00:28:31,531 --> 00:28:33,200
Scott: Because nobody is if I'm.

483
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:41,205
Scott: if I'm developing a game and I can develop a game for any platform I want, why would I even if Nintendo is open and will let any game go in the store.

484
00:28:41,367 --> 00:28:41,610
Scott: Right.

485
00:28:42,051 --> 00:28:50,010
Scott: Why would I go on and why would I spend all this time, you know, learning Nintendo's platform when I can just make an XNA kind of game or a Valve game?

486
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:58,030
Scott: The only reason I would do it is because the Nintendo platform has stuff, has hardware, has accessories, has things that no other platform has.

487
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:08,757
Rym: I mean, like Crystal Chronicles and Four Swords were like this amazing new concept and they made some demos like, hey, look what you could do and make a game for Nintendo if it meant that I can make a game.

488
00:29:08,797 --> 00:29:23,289
Scott: that was not possible in any other platform, because I know that every single person who has that platform has these particular accessories that go with it, like the Wii U with its extra screens or the 3DS with its 3D or the DS with its two screens and touching.

489
00:29:23,551 --> 00:29:24,096
Scott: Right.

490
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:25,890
Scott: And that's the only that's the thing.

491
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:32,867
Scott: So if they opened up, they would attract developers for those reasons, because I could make a game on the PC.

492
00:29:32,908 --> 00:29:33,030
Scott: Sure.

493
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,516
Scott: But you can't make a game on the PC.

494
00:29:34,537 --> 00:29:37,410
Scott: that is 4DS is attached to the television.

495
00:29:38,032 --> 00:29:41,569
Scott: So if you got an idea for a game like that, well, Nintendo's the only game in town.

496
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:47,940
Rym: But now this won't happen because there are, you know, there's those Japanese and stubborn.

497
00:29:48,084 --> 00:29:48,289
Rym: Oh, no.

498
00:29:48,490 --> 00:30:08,410
Rym: Even my thing of if Microsoft pushed it and worked with Valve straight up and they actually not going to have put aside corporate bureaucracy, they could, I think, literally destroy the console market to the point that commodity hardware gets released every five years.

499
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,129
Rym: That is just, you know, this is the spec.

500
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:20,090
Rym: If you have the spec, any game for this, you know, joint valve XA, whatever venture will run on it with guaranteed performance.

501
00:30:21,991 --> 00:30:24,367
Rym: And then I mean, I would just have that instead of my HDPC.

502
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:25,651
Scott: Yeah.

503
00:30:25,692 --> 00:30:31,015
Scott: The thing is, you get all those, you know, things with, you know, all the pitfalls of PC gaming.

504
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:31,277
Scott: Right.

505
00:30:31,298 --> 00:30:32,830
Scott: Whereas that we have no problem PC gaming.

506
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:33,333
Scott: Right.

507
00:30:33,594 --> 00:30:36,030
Rym: But the reference, most people out there.

508
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:36,476
Scott: Right.

509
00:30:36,577 --> 00:30:37,510
Scott: Even look at Penny Arcade.

510
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:38,849
Scott: Those guys play a lot of games.

511
00:30:39,431 --> 00:30:43,350
Scott: Every time my game goes to play a PC game, he's like, oh, I got PC gaming.

512
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:43,995
Scott: It didn't work.

513
00:30:44,035 --> 00:30:45,830
Scott: Video card driver display.

514
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:50,913
Rym: But then again, this is why, you know, the valve set top box would be such an interesting idea.

515
00:30:51,195 --> 00:30:53,450
Rym: Well, not interesting because people have tried this before.

516
00:30:53,892 --> 00:30:56,910
Rym: They failed because they weren't valve and or Microsoft.

517
00:30:57,514 --> 00:30:57,999
Scott: They were.

518
00:30:58,302 --> 00:30:58,969
Scott: What was it called?

519
00:30:59,150 --> 00:30:59,471
Scott: Phantom.

520
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:05,860
Rym: I'm thinking even older than that, there are a lot of companies that tried to market PCs designed for gaming.

521
00:31:06,161 --> 00:31:09,230
Rym: that were black boxes that you connected to a TV and they were just all disasters.

522
00:31:09,971 --> 00:31:18,324
Rym: But the idea of having reference hardware that you would get a seal of approval like this is certified to run valve series 2012 games.

523
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:23,890
Rym: And when you make a game, you could certify it for that reference hardware.

524
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:25,736
Rym: But I digress.

525
00:31:25,937 --> 00:31:28,010
Rym: That's a whole but all that stuff is kind of too good.

526
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,369
Scott: The problem isn't necessarily your hardware requirements.

527
00:31:30,631 --> 00:31:36,689
Scott: Mostly the problem is, you know, your software, because you're running just Windows, you fuck it up because you're a fuckhead.

528
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:41,070
Scott: That's why either you installed some stupid shit on there and now your games don't.

529
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:54,454
Rym: That's why either valve makes, you know, a set top box that is semi locked down or at you don't know what everyone cracks it because they want to pirate and or steal and or cheat.

530
00:31:54,817 --> 00:31:56,009
Scott: And now everyone's fucked up.

531
00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:00,955
Rym: No, because if they crack it, the people who crack that stuff are the people who don't have problems.

532
00:32:00,995 --> 00:32:01,962
Rym: No, no, it's the opposite.

533
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:08,909
Scott: The people who crack everything and the people the most problems because they cause the problems by cracking and then they complain that it broke because they cracked it.

534
00:32:09,571 --> 00:32:23,303
Rym: Most of the people who complain about PC gaming that I run into either are unrelatedly doofuses running like the obviously Trojaned like Photoshop, the obviously Trojaned, you know, pirate hacks.

535
00:32:23,363 --> 00:32:25,552
Scott: I downloaded that because I was too dumb.

536
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,949
Rym: Anyway, they they can handle that, I think.

537
00:32:29,432 --> 00:32:31,669
Rym: But to Microsoft could push it.

538
00:32:32,131 --> 00:32:37,786
Rym: But I I don't know what Valve is actually doing because they haven't said.

539
00:32:37,927 --> 00:32:40,790
Rym: all we know is they're looking at hardware.

540
00:32:41,352 --> 00:32:42,889
Scott: Hopefully they're going to make some control.

541
00:32:45,292 --> 00:32:46,930
Rym: When's that D-pad patent expire?

542
00:32:47,752 --> 00:32:48,356
Scott: I think it did.

543
00:32:48,376 --> 00:32:50,730
Scott: Just people don't make D-pads.

544
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:51,391
Scott: I don't know why.

545
00:32:56,717 --> 00:32:59,560
Rym: But anyway, briefly, things of the day.

546
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:11,960
Rym: So we're just talking a whole bunch about Portal and I found this pretty funny video of two people playing Portal in the classic shtick of one of them sarcastic, but kind of smart, but kind of a dick.

547
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,940
Scott: And one of them is pretending to be dumb or is kind of dumb.

548
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,639
Rym: He's pretending to be really dumb, but it's animated pretty well.

549
00:33:19,241 --> 00:33:22,740
Rym: With the pony sisters, and it's actually really goddamn funny.

550
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,432
Scott: It's kind of funny.

551
00:33:23,452 --> 00:33:23,820
Scott: It's clever.

552
00:33:24,221 --> 00:33:25,620
Rym: Yeah, I really enjoyed it.

553
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,020
Rym: Like I started watching it.

554
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,600
Rym: I was like, oh, this will probably be OK, funny.

555
00:33:29,265 --> 00:33:30,680
Rym: And I laughed out loud a couple of times.

556
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,840
Scott: It's that kind of, you know, funny like Jake and Amir, which is not funny to me.

557
00:33:34,061 --> 00:33:35,680
Rym: I find Jake and Amir to be utterly hilarious.

558
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,200
Scott: I don't like it when someone is intentionally stupid, you know, kind of funny.

559
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,624
Rym: Well, you have the situation of you cannot watch fiction where there's a character who is not intelligent.

560
00:33:45,568 --> 00:33:48,020
Scott: They just can't be really pointlessly fake stupid.

561
00:33:48,721 --> 00:33:49,605
Rym: What do you mean fake stupid?

562
00:33:49,646 --> 00:33:52,380
Rym: Some people, Scott, are that stupid.

563
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,020
Scott: But not, stupid people are not stupid in that way.

564
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:55,939
Rym: Sometimes they are.

565
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,039
Rym: No, I don't think you've met enough stupid people.

566
00:33:58,441 --> 00:33:59,960
Scott: Only like Ralph Wiggum, right?

567
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,495
Scott: Ralph Wiggum works, right?

568
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:04,160
Scott: Anyway, so check this out.

569
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:04,719
Scott: I'm checking.

570
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:12,520
Scott: Atlas, you know, is a company, if you don't know that, you know, they make a lot of, you know, really, really nerdy Japanese kind of games.

571
00:34:13,081 --> 00:34:14,429
Scott: And occasionally those games come out in the

572
00:34:14,509 --> 00:34:14,891
Scott: U.S.,

573
00:34:15,213 --> 00:34:18,399
Scott: usually for portable systems, at least lately, DS, PSP and such.

574
00:34:19,543 --> 00:34:19,744
Scott: Right.

575
00:34:20,406 --> 00:34:24,120
Scott: And I've usually found that Atlas games, like on paper, are so awesome.

576
00:34:24,282 --> 00:34:25,960
Scott: And stylistically, they're so awesome.

577
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,440
Scott: Japanese anime, manga styling, so awesome.

578
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,344
Scott: And you want to play them.

579
00:34:29,706 --> 00:34:33,056
Scott: But then when you actually play them, they're so Japanese, you don't want to play them.

580
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:40,139
Rym: Well, remember that time we saw that we saw an opener to what looked like an anime and we were like, this looks like the best anime.

581
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,980
Rym: And then we found out it was a shitty fighting game.

582
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,221
Scott: Right.

583
00:34:42,241 --> 00:34:44,020
Scott: So I don't think that that is Atlas.

584
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,277
Rym: I'm just saying that that happened to us.

585
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,333
Scott: Yeah, that game was called Er, Eridsvodu, right.

586
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:51,898
Scott: It was called something else in the U.S.

587
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:54,800
Scott: But I don't know if that was Atlas or not.

588
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:59,400
Scott: But this game is Atlas and it's called Growlancer Wayfarer of Time.

589
00:34:59,944 --> 00:35:00,997
Scott: And I don't know what kind of game is.

590
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:01,876
Scott: I guess it's an RPG.

591
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,679
Rym: People have been tweeting about this.

592
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:11,785
Scott: The opener of this game looks like an anime from like the late 80s, early 90s fantasy style.

593
00:35:11,967 --> 00:35:13,940
Scott: It's like this unbelievable opener.

594
00:35:14,402 --> 00:35:18,399
Scott: That is like traveling in a time machine to go back to the past.

595
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,884
Scott: And it's like someone.

596
00:35:20,064 --> 00:35:32,080
Scott: it's like they went back in time, found an anime from the late 80s that was never actually produced, brought it to the present, used all the video from this anime as the video for this video game.

597
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,560
Scott: Now, the video game is probably not worth playing, but watch this opener.

598
00:35:37,141 --> 00:35:43,160
Rym: Well, it says the genre is SRPG, I guess, strategy role playing game.

599
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:43,845
Rym: I don't know what.

600
00:35:43,865 --> 00:35:44,389
Rym: I have no idea.

601
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:46,959
Scott: They could be strategy.

602
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,154
Scott: Usually if it was shitty RPG, shitty, I would imagine it was tactics.

603
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,739
Scott: It would be T-RPG.

604
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:54,742
Rym: Right.

605
00:35:54,782 --> 00:36:02,639
Rym: Well, I highly doubt that tactical versus strategic plays a factor in anyone who likes RPG except us.

606
00:36:03,502 --> 00:36:08,701
Scott: And even then, those words don't mean whatever I guess is not a game you actually want to play.

607
00:36:08,761 --> 00:36:10,490
Rym: unless you like how you're.

608
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:20,465
Scott: you're that kind of person who likes to play the incredibly Japanese games like, you know, Super Robot Tyson or what's the one with the maze, the maze one?

609
00:36:20,505 --> 00:36:21,838
Rym: Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

610
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,966
Rym: Etrian Odyssey.

611
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:25,340
Scott: If you like that kind of game, then you'll probably like this game.

612
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:33,140
Rym: So I recall for you, Scott, I remember a time we saw a trailer to a movie that was a remake of Kishan or Kisharn, The Robot Hunter.

613
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:33,642
Rym: That's right.

614
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:38,580
Rym: And that trailer looked like the greatest movie of our generation.

615
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,142
Scott: That's right.

616
00:36:39,645 --> 00:36:43,302
Rym: That movie was one of the worst movies of our generation.

617
00:36:43,343 --> 00:36:46,776
Rym: It was indeed eclipsed only by that movie.

618
00:36:46,796 --> 00:36:52,958
Rym: that wasn't actually made because M. Night Shyamalan died, Avatar, The Last Airbender, which is literally the second worst movie I've ever seen.

619
00:36:54,742 --> 00:36:55,305
Rym: So we'll see.

620
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:59,060
Rym: Just watch this opener and we'll tell you if the game is worthwhile later.

621
00:37:00,161 --> 00:37:05,529
Rym: So very briefly, in about a moment, we will be at Kinetic Con doing our thing, running the panels department.

622
00:37:05,549 --> 00:37:06,520
Scott: We'll be at Zenkai Con.

623
00:37:06,901 --> 00:37:08,259
Rym: We were already at Zenkai Con.

624
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,238
Scott: By the time the show came out.

625
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,188
Rym: Yeah, Mr.

626
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,320
Scott: Ruining the Illusion.

627
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,339
Scott: I'm the illusion ruiner, you know this.

628
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,442
Rym: Yeah, I could just.

629
00:37:15,463 --> 00:37:19,124
Scott: You're always trying to make illusions and I'm always trying to dispel them.

630
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:20,460
Rym: I'll just cut that part out.

631
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,183
Scott: Yeah, don't.

632
00:37:23,031 --> 00:37:24,980
Rym: And we'll be at PAX Prime and all that other stuff.

633
00:37:25,061 --> 00:37:25,791
Rym: But that's down the road.

634
00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:26,439
Rym: It's summer.

635
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:28,508
Rym: I'll be in Turkey next week.

636
00:37:28,528 --> 00:37:30,440
Scott: Why are you listening to us and not going outside?

637
00:37:31,142 --> 00:37:33,399
Rym: Why are you listening to us and not preparing for PAX?

638
00:37:35,063 --> 00:37:36,260
Rym: You should have already bought your badges.

639
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,063
Scott: You should have.

640
00:37:37,103 --> 00:37:40,769
Scott: If you haven't bought your badge already, just, you know, you don't deserve to go.

641
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:41,114
Scott: So don't go.

642
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,486
Rym: So we were.

643
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,137
Rym: we're at a board game night at NYC.

644
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,238
Rym: Scott got there a little bit before me.

645
00:37:48,002 --> 00:37:50,560
Rym: And when I arrived, he was playing a game.

646
00:37:51,281 --> 00:38:01,380
Rym: And I just want to say that if you don't know what this game is and you see some people playing it, it looks ridiculous in terms of complexity.

647
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:01,741
Scott: Right.

648
00:38:02,043 --> 00:38:05,280
Scott: So you have all these different colored pyramids of different shapes and sizes.

649
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,200
Scott: And I had seen these pyramids at game stores.

650
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,941
Rym: They're a millennium and they were always like stupidly expensive, pretty much packs of them.

651
00:38:11,961 --> 00:38:15,562
Scott: Pretty much every game store in the world I've ever been to sells these little pyramids.

652
00:38:15,642 --> 00:38:20,624
Scott: And in the little package of pyramids is like a little piece of paper and has some game in it.

653
00:38:20,644 --> 00:38:24,726
Scott: And I'm like, whatever, you know, it's usually next to some like random dice game.

654
00:38:24,786 --> 00:38:29,160
Rym: Usually it has like a whole ton of games in them because they're the ice house pieces or the labs pyramid.

655
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,260
Scott: That's that's what they're known as is ice house pieces.

656
00:38:31,762 --> 00:38:34,100
Scott: And there's all kinds of games you can play with them.

657
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:40,379
Scott: And if you go online, you can download like these packages that are like these books that is like a hundred ice house games.

658
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,081
Scott: Right.

659
00:38:41,242 --> 00:38:43,160
Scott: All these games you can play with ice house pieces.

660
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,140
Rym: They're just pawns to use to make games.

661
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:54,360
Scott: Yeah, it's you know, and the thing is, because they're pyramids, because they come in multiple colors in multiple sizes, there's a lot you can do with them.

662
00:38:54,502 --> 00:38:55,011
Scott: You know, they stack.

663
00:38:55,842 --> 00:38:58,240
Scott: So the stacking factor adds even more that you can do.

664
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,178
Rym: Scott, we should use them in Burning Wheel as our arta.

665
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:01,463
Scott: You can do that.

666
00:39:01,543 --> 00:39:06,600
Scott: But anyway, so this game that we played, you know, was called Zendo.

667
00:39:07,082 --> 00:39:07,343
Scott: Right.

668
00:39:07,524 --> 00:39:12,240
Scott: And apparently, I don't know, I obviously only know one game that you can play with ice house pieces.

669
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,280
Rym: I read all the other rules for a whole bunch of other games.

670
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:19,739
Scott: I already am of the opinion, even after knowing the rules to zero other ice house games, that this is the best ice house game.

671
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:23,760
Rym: Having read the rules to like 10 ice house games, they're pretty shit by and large.

672
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:24,120
Scott: Right.

673
00:39:24,141 --> 00:39:28,180
Scott: But anyway, so to explain Zendo, I first got to explain Mastermind.

674
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:28,682
Scott: Right.

675
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:30,020
Scott: So Mastermind is this game.

676
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,803
Scott: It's really old.

677
00:39:30,884 --> 00:39:34,200
Scott: It's actually, I think, an American game and it's a code breaking game.

678
00:39:34,783 --> 00:39:38,360
Scott: One person comes up with a code and the code is just colors in order.

679
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,140
Scott: So the code could be like red, green, blue, yellow.

680
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:47,480
Rym: Scott, it was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Marowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert.

681
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,122
Rym: Awesome.

682
00:39:48,504 --> 00:39:52,160
Rym: But it's based on an earlier game called Bulls and Cows.

683
00:39:52,362 --> 00:39:54,319
Rym: That's at least more than a century old.

684
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,560
Scott: Thank you for reading Wikipedia.

685
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:02,659
Scott: And the way the way Mastermind works is that one person puts the code in there and the other person is to figure out the code.

686
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,859
Scott: So it's sort of a versus game.

687
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:08,386
Scott: It's like, can you come up with a pattern that I can't figure out in some number of tries?

688
00:40:08,427 --> 00:40:09,119
Scott: It's one on one.

689
00:40:09,664 --> 00:40:10,960
Scott: And what you do is you make a guess.

690
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,660
Scott: So you have a whole bunch of pieces and you put out a guess.

691
00:40:14,202 --> 00:40:16,940
Scott: And if your thing matches the other guy's thing, he's like, yeah, it matches.

692
00:40:17,101 --> 00:40:18,679
Scott: If it doesn't match, he's like, no, it doesn't match.

693
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:20,299
Scott: And you got to keep trying.

694
00:40:21,161 --> 00:40:28,020
Scott: And based on the clues you get from his answers, right, you keep going like you'll know all that has to correct in that one.

695
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:32,819
Scott: And that one has one correct, which means that that one is definitely green in the second slot.

696
00:40:33,102 --> 00:40:35,500
Rym: So I used to play this game a lot as a kid.

697
00:40:36,741 --> 00:40:40,160
Rym: And now that I know game theory and I look back at it, it seems pretty solvable.

698
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,906
Rym: And you know what?

699
00:40:42,327 --> 00:40:47,500
Rym: Just looking at Wikipedia, there are algorithms that you can just always solve it in six guesses.

700
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:51,800
Scott: Right, because it's trivially easy to solve it in some number of guesses, because there's only, I think, four colors.

701
00:40:52,421 --> 00:40:52,722
Rym: Right.

702
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:57,040
Rym: But there's there's one, two, three, four slots and a number of colors.

703
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:57,682
Scott: Right.

704
00:40:57,943 --> 00:41:00,519
Scott: But yeah, mathematically, it's like you can always get it.

705
00:41:00,742 --> 00:41:01,960
Rym: Four pegs, six colors.

706
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:06,240
Rym: There is a six guess algorithm and a five guess algorithm.

707
00:41:06,622 --> 00:41:07,599
Scott: Wow, that's good.

708
00:41:08,661 --> 00:41:12,400
Scott: Anyway, so I played this game as a kid and we actually had mastermind for kids.

709
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:14,420
Scott: And I got to say mastermind for kids.

710
00:41:15,002 --> 00:41:23,180
Scott: If you're going to buy a copy of Mastermind, don't get the regular old boring mastermind, get mastermind for kids, because it is the same exact game.

711
00:41:23,644 --> 00:41:25,119
Scott: It is not modified in any way.

712
00:41:25,702 --> 00:41:25,944
Scott: It is.

713
00:41:25,964 --> 00:41:29,442
Scott: It's not like when they make Monopoly Junior and it's dumb as Monopoly.

714
00:41:29,844 --> 00:41:30,105
Scott: Right.

715
00:41:30,266 --> 00:41:35,860
Scott: Or Cluke Junior, which was similar to Clue and actually kind of better in some ways, but still dumb ass clue.

716
00:41:36,241 --> 00:41:37,187
Rym: What exactly is it called?

717
00:41:37,207 --> 00:41:39,906
Rym: Because I have a list here of all the variations and rereleases.

718
00:41:39,927 --> 00:41:41,079
Scott: Mastermind for kids.

719
00:41:41,941 --> 00:41:45,360
Scott: The reason to get mastermind for kids is because the same exact game.

720
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,660
Rym: No, it only has three holes, not four, like real masterminds.

721
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:48,742
Rym: What?

722
00:41:48,762 --> 00:41:49,560
Rym: No, I remember the one.

723
00:41:49,981 --> 00:41:51,080
Rym: Wikipedia says you're wrong.

724
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,460
Scott: My memory must be wrong, but I remember having four holes.

725
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,040
Rym: I'm glad I said the words.

726
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:01,645
Rym: Wikipedia says you're wrong and your immediate response was, well, my memory must be wrong.

727
00:42:02,049 --> 00:42:03,340
Rym: Not Wikipedia.

728
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,264
Scott: Really?

729
00:42:04,285 --> 00:42:05,700
Scott: Some guy on the Internet?

730
00:42:06,361 --> 00:42:07,880
Scott: I remember there being four colors.

731
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:08,771
Rym: I'm going to look it up.

732
00:42:08,852 --> 00:42:09,420
Scott: Four holes.

733
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:16,073
Scott: Anyway, the reason that I thought it was better if it is indeed the same game is because it has a style to it.

734
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:17,721
Scott: Right.

735
00:42:17,782 --> 00:42:19,740
Rym: It's not elephants and hippos and lions.

736
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,385
Scott: That's right.

737
00:42:20,466 --> 00:42:21,759
Rym: It's not shaped like a dick.

738
00:42:22,103 --> 00:42:23,380
Scott: It's not with a gland.

739
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:23,907
Scott: That's right.

740
00:42:23,988 --> 00:42:24,620
Scott: It is a penis.

741
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,780
Scott: It's not just boring colors.

742
00:42:27,022 --> 00:42:29,119
Scott: It's like animal monkey hippo.

743
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,102
Scott: Right.

744
00:42:30,828 --> 00:42:32,099
Scott: And it has a style to it.

745
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,480
Rym: Scott, this game's a dick.

746
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,771
Scott: This is why you like it.

747
00:42:34,832 --> 00:42:35,278
Scott: Look at this.

748
00:42:35,841 --> 00:42:36,437
Scott: Look at this game.

749
00:42:40,262 --> 00:42:41,919
Scott: Anyway, that's the version we had.

750
00:42:44,943 --> 00:42:46,660
Scott: So I remember it having four holes.

751
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,500
Rym: Scott, I got to read this to you because the five guess algorithm is really simple.

752
00:42:51,482 --> 00:42:54,860
Rym: One, create a set S of the remaining possibilities.

753
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,640
Rym: Now, there are only twelve hundred ninety six anyway.

754
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,484
Scott: So pick anything.

755
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,115
Rym: The first guess is AABB.

756
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:21,880
Rym: Remove all possibilities from S. that would not give the same score of colored and white pegs if they were the answer for each possible guess that remains, not necessarily in S. OK, so for each possible guess, calculate how many possibilities from S would be eliminated for each possible colored white score.

757
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,640
Scott: So this is not trivial to do in your brain.

758
00:43:25,261 --> 00:43:25,584
Rym: All right.

759
00:43:25,786 --> 00:43:27,020
Rym: So there is another algorithm.

760
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,960
Rym: I'm not going to read the whole thing that you can do in your brain.

761
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:30,976
Scott: That's the six guess.

762
00:43:31,017 --> 00:43:31,180
Scott: Yes.

763
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,466
Rym: Six guesses in the brain.

764
00:43:32,567 --> 00:43:34,960
Rym: Five guesses if you're a rain man or a computer.

765
00:43:35,322 --> 00:43:38,240
Rym: One guess if your mom's wearing glasses and you can see the room.

766
00:43:38,821 --> 00:43:39,567
Scott: Oh, yes.

767
00:43:40,715 --> 00:43:41,320
Scott: Oh, yes.

768
00:43:42,862 --> 00:43:44,600
Rym: Anyway, I thought I was so clever.

769
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,820
Rym: I thought my parents would be like, he's a genius.

770
00:43:46,962 --> 00:43:48,140
Rym: No, they were like, you must have cheated.

771
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,797
Scott: The point of Mastermind is the other guy picks something and it's like you.

772
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:53,540
Scott: it's like twenty questions, right?

773
00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:00,564
Scott: It's like you slowly get more information as you guess, leading up towards guessing the correct answer.

774
00:44:00,605 --> 00:44:05,400
Scott: the other guy's thought up or failing to do so in the given number of guesses and then losing.

775
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:10,160
Scott: So Zendo is the same thing, but slightly different and way better.

776
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,518
Scott: The way it works is this.

777
00:44:12,462 --> 00:44:17,274
Scott: One person is the game runner and they come up with something or they look in the book and pick something.

778
00:44:17,295 --> 00:44:17,458
Scott: Right.

779
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,080
Scott: And there's different levels of difficulty.

780
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:21,060
Scott: That is the Buddha nature.

781
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:24,680
Rym: Now, there's this whole you know, the guy who taught it to us and played it with us.

782
00:44:24,961 --> 00:44:31,960
Rym: There's this whole sort of metagame of people who run it a lot aren't supposed to say like what constitutes the levels or anything.

783
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,079
Rym: And you kind of figure that out.

784
00:44:33,501 --> 00:44:37,419
Rym: Like so the cone master will say something like this is a level three.

785
00:44:38,061 --> 00:44:38,161
Scott: Yeah.

786
00:44:38,181 --> 00:44:40,780
Scott: They don't have to tell you what level difficulty it is or not.

787
00:44:40,941 --> 00:44:41,162
Scott: Right.

788
00:44:41,724 --> 00:44:44,900
Scott: But anyway, so every cone has different properties.

789
00:44:45,123 --> 00:44:45,386
Scott: Right.

790
00:44:45,447 --> 00:44:46,419
Scott: It has its size.

791
00:44:47,381 --> 00:44:48,084
Scott: It has its color.

792
00:44:48,847 --> 00:44:52,240
Scott: It has number of pips on the side of which corresponds to the size.

793
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:52,622
Rym: It does.

794
00:44:52,663 --> 00:44:55,340
Scott: So a big one has three pips and a small one has one pippin.

795
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,378
Scott: A medium one is two pips.

796
00:44:57,221 --> 00:45:05,280
Scott: It can also be laying on its side, which means and because the pyramid, even though it's laying on its side, it could be pointing in different directions.

797
00:45:05,762 --> 00:45:08,600
Rym: It could be not on the table if it is stacked on another pyramid.

798
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,540
Rym: Yeah, it could be pointing at a pyramid.

799
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:14,820
Scott: It could be covered by a pyramid if one is stacked on top of it.

800
00:45:14,941 --> 00:45:16,320
Scott: It could be covered by two pyramids.

801
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,640
Rym: It could be pointed at another pyramid that itself is not touching the table.

802
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:20,060
Scott: Right.

803
00:45:20,361 --> 00:45:26,850
Scott: So what happens is at the very beginning of the game, the game runner, the master.

804
00:45:27,095 --> 00:45:27,300
Scott: Right.

805
00:45:27,861 --> 00:45:30,391
Scott: And everyone else is a student and the game runner is.

806
00:45:30,411 --> 00:45:33,402
Scott: the master decides on what is the Buddha nature.

807
00:45:33,443 --> 00:45:37,822
Scott: So the Buddha nature could be something like at least one pyramid is green.

808
00:45:38,505 --> 00:45:42,080
Scott: So they would produce a set of pyramids in some configuration.

809
00:45:42,221 --> 00:45:52,620
Scott: That is the Buddha nature, meaning there is at least one green pyramid in it, and they would put next to it a gem signifying that that set has the Buddha nature, typically a white stone.

810
00:45:53,562 --> 00:45:53,843
Scott: Yes.

811
00:45:53,863 --> 00:46:00,520
Scott: Then they will produce another set using any number of pyramids in any configuration that does not have the Buddha nature.

812
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:05,160
Scott: So in this example case, there would be no green pyramids in that set whatsoever.

813
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:16,324
Scott: Then player one, and this is where it gets better than mastermind because you can have a lot of players guessing right in a round player one produces a set of pyramids and lays them out.

814
00:46:16,889 --> 00:46:18,020
Scott: And then he has two choices.

815
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,931
Scott: He can either say student or master.

816
00:46:20,535 --> 00:46:21,420
Scott: if he says students.

817
00:46:21,763 --> 00:46:23,520
Scott: Yeah, we'll do master first.

818
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:32,760
Scott: If he says master, the master will then place a stone next to that set, signifying whether that set does or does not have the Buddha nature.

819
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:40,680
Rym: Now, it's very the best way to play this is to kind of get into the theme a little bit and be very formal, like master, wise master.

820
00:46:41,182 --> 00:46:51,927
Rym: Does this set, you know, even just exhibit the Buddha nature, reading around the Internet, people usually just say the word master and then the master will silently place the white or the black stone.

821
00:46:51,947 --> 00:46:53,520
Rym: And that is the only interaction.

822
00:46:53,841 --> 00:46:54,243
Scott: That's good.

823
00:46:54,985 --> 00:47:02,140
Scott: Anyway, then after doing so right, because you would never you could do before doing so, but there's no reason to because you can always get the free guess.

824
00:47:03,003 --> 00:47:05,760
Scott: You can use your guessing stone.

825
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,168
Scott: How many guessing stones everyone get?

826
00:47:07,248 --> 00:47:09,199
Rym: Everyone starts with, I believe, one or two.

827
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:09,684
Scott: One or two.

828
00:47:09,704 --> 00:47:10,740
Scott: You have a guessing stone.

829
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,540
Rym: There's different sets of rules online.

830
00:47:13,201 --> 00:47:16,700
Scott: If you use the guessing stone, you would guess at the Buddha nature.

831
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:27,720
Scott: So if you put your guessing stone, you could say the Buddha nature is at least two greens or if and only if the number of blue pieces touching at least one green piece is odd.

832
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:28,762
Scott: Yeah, it could be.

833
00:47:28,882 --> 00:47:33,400
Scott: or the number of pips on all the pyramids combined is a prime number.

834
00:47:33,881 --> 00:47:34,142
Scott: Right.

835
00:47:34,423 --> 00:47:41,378
Scott: You know, or the you know, the square of all the pips combined is, you know, larger than 100, something like that.

836
00:47:42,162 --> 00:47:52,213
Scott: And then, you know, what would happen is, A, either you would win because you guessed correctly or B, the master would then produce a set of pyramids.

837
00:47:52,574 --> 00:47:56,059
Scott: that is contradictory to the thing you just said.

838
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:07,246
Rym: So either is an example that breaks your rule, but still gets a white stone because it has the Buddha nature or something that does not have the Buddha nature, but that perfectly meets your rule.

839
00:48:07,608 --> 00:48:09,500
Rym: Now, this is why this game is so fascinating.

840
00:48:10,141 --> 00:48:15,603
Rym: You can't cheat as the master because that will become immediately apparent to the students.

841
00:48:15,884 --> 00:48:18,340
Rym: Yeah, because everything has to be consistent.

842
00:48:18,781 --> 00:48:32,300
Rym: And if you come up with a rule for the Buddha nature and a student comes up with an equivalent rule, the master that that counts because the master is unable to refute the rule, even though it's worded differently.

843
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:37,751
Rym: So it gets you out of that sort of fiddly wording problem because at its core, it's inductive reasoning.

844
00:48:38,178 --> 00:48:38,340
Scott: Right.

845
00:48:38,741 --> 00:48:43,436
Scott: So, you know, for example, let's say the Buddha nature was, you know, I don't know.

846
00:48:46,842 --> 00:48:55,420
Scott: There are no red pieces, there are no red pieces, right, and the other guy says there are only pieces that are blue, green, black or yellow.

847
00:48:55,942 --> 00:48:56,264
Scott: Right.

848
00:48:56,344 --> 00:48:58,459
Scott: Well, obviously those are equivalent rules.

849
00:48:58,701 --> 00:49:00,000
Rym: Here's a more sidelong example.

850
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,721
Rym: My my guess for the there are no red pieces is there are no pyramids pointing at a red piece.

851
00:49:08,868 --> 00:49:12,380
Rym: That is an equivalent rule, because how is the master going to refute that?

852
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:17,840
Scott: There are no pyramids pointing at a red piece, you know, I guess.

853
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:18,141
Scott: Yeah.

854
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:26,520
Scott: So it's, you know, you come up with pretty much the same rule, you know, or an equivalent rule that a contradictory example could not be produced anyway.

855
00:49:26,661 --> 00:49:33,199
Scott: So you go around the table and you make, you know, you play and if you want to use your guessing stone, you can guess.

856
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:38,620
Scott: But if you fail at guessing, you lost your guessing stone and now you can't guess again.

857
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,120
Scott: So if you figure out the answer and you don't have a guessing stone, you're fucked.

858
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,520
Rym: So, Scott, how does one get more guessing stone?

859
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:47,480
Scott: Well, instead of choosing master, you choose students.

860
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:55,900
Scott: So you produce your set for free at the beginning of your turn and you say students and then everyone puts out a hand, everyone puts out a sealed hand.

861
00:49:56,021 --> 00:49:59,120
Scott: And in that sealed hand is a black or a white stone guess.

862
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:06,120
Scott: And it's a guess that every student guesses whether the, you know, set you just produced exhibits the Buddha nature or not.

863
00:50:06,542 --> 00:50:09,540
Scott: If they guess correctly, they receive a guessing stone.

864
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,560
Scott: If they guess wrongly, they don't receive a guessing stone.

865
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:16,020
Rym: But this can be a little dangerous because you're giving everyone else the opportunity.

866
00:50:16,141 --> 00:50:18,279
Rym: For example, say someone else is closer than you.

867
00:50:18,803 --> 00:50:21,200
Rym: You might give them a guessing stone because they guess better.

868
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:27,420
Scott: And in fact, if you are closer, the odds of guessing correctly and getting the guessing stone when someone chooses students are much higher.

869
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:29,880
Rym: Now, the other thing is this is where it gets interesting.

870
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:39,721
Rym: You might notice that someone else, the shapes they made or the cones they made on their turn seem to be testing certain things and they guess right on a couple of students in a row.

871
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:46,240
Rym: You could figure out that they're clearly on the right track and look at what they were constructing and asking the master.

872
00:50:47,242 --> 00:50:50,260
Rym: So you're interacting with the other players and their tests.

873
00:50:50,642 --> 00:50:55,083
Rym: For example, you might be close, but you might not want to do a certain test because it tips your hand.

874
00:50:55,123 --> 00:51:01,220
Rym: If you think that you're on the right path and no one else is, you don't want to do a test that makes it obvious you're testing color, for example.

875
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:04,520
Rym: So the game gets really interesting in that level.

876
00:51:04,843 --> 00:51:06,540
Rym: But in the end, it's just pattern recognition.

877
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,203
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much.

878
00:51:08,304 --> 00:51:14,860
Scott: it's the same game as Mastermind, only multiplayer and much more complex because there are so many more factors that go into it.

879
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,080
Rym: Now, usually people play with a set of ground rules.

880
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:23,348
Rym: Like if you make a guess, like there are only blue pieces next to yellow pieces, if whatever, whatever, whatever.

881
00:51:23,389 --> 00:51:24,600
Rym: There's a thousand qualifiers.

882
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,780
Rym: The master can be like, that's ridiculous.

883
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:28,019
Rym: I'm not even going to take a stone.

884
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:28,541
Scott: Yeah.

885
00:51:28,561 --> 00:51:33,640
Scott: And the thing is, the master isn't going to choose something for the Buddha nature that is so complicated.

886
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:38,802
Rym: He could, but only if all the players are on that level or are really willing to deal with that.

887
00:51:38,822 --> 00:51:38,963
Rym: Yeah.

888
00:51:39,003 --> 00:51:52,879
Scott: Who's going to be a jerk and be like, yeah, the Buddha nature is at least one blue pointing at a yellow, at least one yellow pointing at a green, at least one thing somewhere that's stacked, at least two pyramids laying down and all the pips add up to an odd number.

889
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,103
Scott: And there's no green.

890
00:51:54,143 --> 00:52:03,519
Rym: Now, more importantly, it's like there are no situational conditions like the player, who the player is or what time it is or anything.

891
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,019
Rym: It's just the pieces.

892
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:06,660
Scott: Yeah, that would be absolute bullshit.

893
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:07,281
Scott: Right.

894
00:52:07,301 --> 00:52:07,965
Rym: And in fact, how would you?

895
00:52:07,985 --> 00:52:11,940
Scott: because you have to be able to look at all the sets that are out on the table as examples.

896
00:52:12,081 --> 00:52:12,221
Scott: Right.

897
00:52:12,342 --> 00:52:18,600
Scott: As you play, you know, just like in Mastermind, every set you play stays out on the table unless you start to run out of expensive.

898
00:52:18,801 --> 00:52:22,339
Rym: Now, more importantly, the way people play this game, too, is you can use anything.

899
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,883
Rym: you could use just any random assortment of bits, as long as they're reasonably consistent with one another.

900
00:52:27,627 --> 00:52:33,934
Rym: And you define the ground rules ahead of time when you're playing with a given group as to what is and is not a state.

901
00:52:34,015 --> 00:52:35,360
Rym: as far as far as the game.

902
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:45,580
Rym: For example, when we were playing, you could put a pyramid pointing at another pyramid, but it did not matter where it was pointing, only that it was pointing at the pyramid or at no pyramid.

903
00:52:45,681 --> 00:52:45,902
Rym: Yeah.

904
00:52:46,043 --> 00:52:48,300
Scott: Or what it didn't matter what direction it was pointing either.

905
00:52:49,504 --> 00:52:49,644
Rym: Yes.

906
00:52:49,664 --> 00:52:53,080
Rym: And you could not put a pyramid inside of a pyramid.

907
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:58,602
Rym: There was pointing at not pointing at on the table, not on the table, laying down, standing up.

908
00:52:58,823 --> 00:52:59,686
Rym: But there was no.

909
00:53:00,007 --> 00:53:06,420
Rym: like in a small pyramid inside of a big pyramid was the same as a small pyramid pointing at a big pyramid.

910
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:14,794
Scott: Before the game, we decided what was going to be a factor, like let's say you could have a game where you said, listen, the only things that are going to be a factor in this game are color and size.

911
00:53:14,874 --> 00:53:15,680
Scott: Nothing else matters.

912
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:16,803
Scott: Right.

913
00:53:16,823 --> 00:53:18,520
Scott: So it's like, oh, so arrangement doesn't matter.

914
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:18,821
Scott: No.

915
00:53:18,841 --> 00:53:22,167
Scott: So green, green, blue is the same as green, blue, green, if they're all the same size.

916
00:53:22,716 --> 00:53:22,980
Scott: Right.

917
00:53:23,341 --> 00:53:31,580
Scott: But, you know, medium green, medium blue, big green is different than medium blue, medium green, medium yellow.

918
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:32,505
Rym: Right.

919
00:53:32,525 --> 00:53:34,520
Scott: So color and size matter, but nothing else.

920
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:34,741
Scott: Yep.

921
00:53:34,781 --> 00:53:40,040
Rym: So because the order didn't matter, order only mattered if things were pointing and then it was just what's pointing at what.

922
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:40,361
Rym: Right.

923
00:53:40,402 --> 00:53:48,180
Scott: So you determine before you start which factors come into play so you can, you know, limit the set of things you have to test for when deciphering the code.

924
00:53:49,801 --> 00:53:55,339
Scott: And yeah, this is crazy fun because, you know, everyone's sitting there racking their brain going, what could it be?

925
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:55,882
Scott: What could it be?

926
00:53:55,923 --> 00:53:59,899
Scott: And you try something you think is clever and then you think it's the Buddha nature and it's not.

927
00:54:00,021 --> 00:54:01,620
Scott: Or you think it is or you think it's not.

928
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:05,160
Rym: And it is a really, really good master, too.

929
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,459
Rym: He's obviously played this game a lot.

930
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:09,940
Rym: He invested in these fucking expensive pieces of plastic.

931
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,380
Rym: I tried to buy them online.

932
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,380
Rym: So the cheapest way to get them in bulk that we can find.

933
00:54:15,723 --> 00:54:16,799
Rym: I did a lot of research.

934
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,579
Scott: You couldn't find used ones on eBay or.

935
00:54:19,182 --> 00:54:20,400
Rym: Yeah, I didn't find anything like that.

936
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,960
Rym: Also, I realized my whole life, you know, I've been on stuff on eBay.

937
00:54:23,502 --> 00:54:25,339
Rym: I've never actually bought a thing on eBay.

938
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:29,980
Scott: I've actually bought quite a ever a nice bunch of stuff on eBay in my entire life.

939
00:54:30,441 --> 00:54:31,344
Rym: But I will link to.

940
00:54:31,705 --> 00:54:40,520
Rym: there's a game called Ice Dice, and it comes with a total of 30 of these pyramids and cost about fifteen to seventy dollars.

941
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,060
Scott: Thirty sets of pyramids.

942
00:54:42,382 --> 00:54:43,640
Scott: That's 30 pyramids.

943
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:49,880
Rym: The sets of pyramids themselves cost twice as much per pyramid.

944
00:54:50,341 --> 00:54:50,522
Rym: Yeah.

945
00:54:50,863 --> 00:54:57,439
Rym: So you were best off buying this crappy ice dice game and you get a big bag and all these pieces and some weird dice.

946
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:04,120
Scott: So when I say a set of pyramids, I mean, right, one red, one small red, one medium red, one one big, right?

947
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:04,990
Scott: All the same color.

948
00:55:05,031 --> 00:55:05,699
Scott: That's a set.

949
00:55:06,185 --> 00:55:06,467
Scott: Right.

950
00:55:06,508 --> 00:55:07,599
Scott: So how many colors are there?

951
00:55:08,621 --> 00:55:10,020
Rym: There's like, well, there are different.

952
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,760
Rym: We play with five colors, I believe.

953
00:55:11,981 --> 00:55:15,219
Rym: Yeah, but there are other sets of colors.

954
00:55:17,026 --> 00:55:17,791
Rym: And I didn't get those.

955
00:55:17,832 --> 00:55:18,900
Rym: like there's a Zeno set.

956
00:55:19,261 --> 00:55:24,259
Rym: And notice how some of the advanced cones have the idea of a, quote, strange piece.

957
00:55:25,802 --> 00:55:29,800
Rym: This game can have as many dimensions of buddiness as between five colors.

958
00:55:30,181 --> 00:55:30,483
Scott: Right.

959
00:55:30,523 --> 00:55:33,779
Scott: You know, red, green, blue, yellow, black, I think are the colors.

960
00:55:34,142 --> 00:55:35,230
Scott: Yeah.

961
00:55:35,452 --> 00:55:36,420
Scott: Three pyramids each.

962
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,460
Scott: So that's five times three is fifteen.

963
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,140
Scott: That's fifteen pyramids.

964
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:47,920
Scott: If you buy a copy of ice dice, you get, you know, two blacks of each size, two reds of each size, two yellows of each size.

965
00:55:48,062 --> 00:55:49,340
Scott: It's not a lot of pyramids.

966
00:55:49,741 --> 00:55:53,640
Scott: You know, you need to spend it's crazy money to get a lot of these pyramids.

967
00:55:53,781 --> 00:55:57,820
Scott: But if you think about it, you know, it's like, OK, you don't really need the pyramids.

968
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:58,830
Scott: You could make these.

969
00:55:58,850 --> 00:55:59,860
Scott: You could do whatever.

970
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:02,420
Rym: But you want the pyramids, you want the pyramids.

971
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:06,540
Scott: And two, even though they're seemingly crazy, overpriced and stupid.

972
00:56:07,821 --> 00:56:10,755
Scott: And Zendo seems to be the only good game we've discovered to play with them.

973
00:56:10,775 --> 00:56:17,282
Scott: yet, there are a bajillion games you can play with these and they're just really useful gaming pieces in general.

974
00:56:17,823 --> 00:56:24,880
Scott: So it's sort of worth it if you heavily utilize them in gaming frequently and try to play all these games with them or come up with games.

975
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,009
Scott: It is very telling that they're so.

976
00:56:27,029 --> 00:56:35,520
Scott: they're such versatile game pieces and they don't serve the same, you know, uses as dice or generic pawns or other gaming pieces.

977
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:43,240
Scott: You know, so they're so they're unique that it's sort of worth having at least some of them if you're not going to buy a ton of them.

978
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:55,239
Rym: The telling factor as to why I think this game was good is that we're playing it for a while and one people kept coming up and staring at it because it looks to them, especially if you're playing like master and then a stone comes out, students, stones come out.

979
00:56:56,321 --> 00:57:00,876
Rym: This game is incomprehensible to outsiders and it looks fascinating and complicated to.

980
00:57:00,896 --> 00:57:05,200
Rym: we just kept playing it and at one point we're like, hey, should we play something else?

981
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,133
Rym: Everyone kind of sat there.

982
00:57:07,161 --> 00:57:08,599
Rym: No, let's just keep playing this.

983
00:57:09,022 --> 00:57:10,259
Rym: Yeah, we played it for a while.

984
00:57:10,941 --> 00:57:19,563
Scott: But the other thing that you can do right is it's up to the master sort of even though the master has no stake in the winning or losing, it's up to them and determining the difficulty.

985
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:19,824
Scott: Right.

986
00:57:20,126 --> 00:57:22,600
Scott: The master could purposefully try to throw you off.

987
00:57:23,143 --> 00:57:24,940
Scott: Like let's say our master did this really well.

988
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:30,320
Rym: He gave what is possibly the most unhelpful set of initial examples possible.

989
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:30,821
Scott: Right.

990
00:57:30,841 --> 00:57:37,395
Scott: So let's say we determine that stacking color size, laying down a number of pips are all going to be factors.

991
00:57:37,517 --> 00:57:37,700
Scott: Right.

992
00:57:38,222 --> 00:57:40,338
Scott: But the actual Buddha nature is no mediums.

993
00:57:41,182 --> 00:57:41,464
Scott: Right.

994
00:57:41,726 --> 00:57:43,620
Scott: So I lay out something with no mediums.

995
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:47,660
Scott: It's got guys laying down and pointing every which way and stacking and whatever.

996
00:57:48,204 --> 00:57:49,600
Scott: And I say that is the Buddha nature.

997
00:57:49,722 --> 00:57:51,058
Scott: And then I lay another one down.

998
00:57:51,481 --> 00:57:52,980
Rym: It's just one medium by itself.

999
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:54,149
Scott: It has a medium.

1000
00:57:54,169 --> 00:57:55,520
Scott: Well, that might be too obvious.

1001
00:57:56,022 --> 00:57:57,940
Rym: It's a medium and a bunch of other pieces.

1002
00:57:58,301 --> 00:58:00,280
Scott: It's a medium and a whole mess of stuff.

1003
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,099
Scott: And I say that does have the Buddha nature.

1004
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,252
Scott: And people be like, whoa, you know, it's like.

1005
00:58:05,312 --> 00:58:19,680
Scott: I purposely try to throw you off by putting all this extra information in there and you're going to have to over time sort of figure out based on what does and doesn't have the Buddha nature that, oh, stacking doesn't matter in this one, even though, you know, we didn't say it beforehand.

1006
00:58:19,781 --> 00:58:22,100
Scott: So you had to figure it out in game, extending the game.

1007
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:29,080
Scott: And if the game gets really long, you either have to remove some of the sets from the table to use the pieces or buy a lot of pieces.

1008
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:35,500
Scott: So to play a really complex, difficult, incredibly high level game of the Zendo, you need a lot of expensive pieces.

1009
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:39,299
Rym: I ordered three sets of the ice dice, which was like forty five bucks or so.

1010
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:39,923
Scott: Yeah.

1011
00:58:39,943 --> 00:58:41,920
Scott: So you could have gotten a real board game for that money.

1012
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,075
Rym: The thing is, I think I would order a few more sets of it just because this.

1013
00:58:45,457 --> 00:58:47,680
Rym: these pieces will be useful, last me forever.

1014
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:52,120
Rym: And it is very fun to be the master.

1015
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:54,340
Rym: You can see the kinds of people who like to run this.

1016
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:54,882
Rym: This is a game.

1017
00:58:54,902 --> 00:59:00,348
Rym: you go to PAX and you will gather a gigantic crowd who will want to play this game trivially.

1018
00:59:00,489 --> 00:59:02,080
Scott: And you can even come up with some variants.

1019
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:02,542
Scott: Right.

1020
00:59:02,684 --> 00:59:03,940
Scott: Because these play any game.

1021
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:04,161
Scott: Right.

1022
00:59:04,181 --> 00:59:08,246
Scott: You come up with variants for like, you know, people could come up to the table, make a guess and leave.

1023
00:59:08,366 --> 00:59:10,640
Scott: And like you just people keep coming up, getting a line.

1024
00:59:11,042 --> 00:59:12,940
Scott: And when you get to the front of the line, it's your turn.

1025
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:14,226
Scott: And it's just a crazy long line.

1026
00:59:14,247 --> 00:59:18,440
Scott: And then whoever gets it wins and your table just keeps filling up with more and more pieces.

1027
00:59:18,842 --> 00:59:21,200
Scott: But since everyone's in line, they don't see it till they get up there.

1028
00:59:21,301 --> 00:59:24,140
Scott: And like maybe they have 30 seconds to do something, you know.

1029
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:27,399
Scott: Anyway, you could come up with a lot of fun stuff to do.

1030
00:59:27,721 --> 00:59:28,588
Rym: It's a super fun game.

1031
00:59:28,628 --> 00:59:30,300
Rym: I highly recommend it, but it's expensive.

1032
00:59:30,881 --> 00:59:33,480
Rym: So trick one of your friends into buying the pieces and running it for you.

1033
00:59:33,701 --> 00:59:38,645
Scott: Or maybe find some other sort of pieces that have an equal number of factors that you can play.

1034
00:59:38,686 --> 00:59:40,279
Rym: You can do this with like dice.

1035
00:59:41,061 --> 00:59:41,545
Scott: Sort of.

1036
00:59:41,727 --> 00:59:43,079
Scott: You need colored dice.

1037
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:48,628
Rym: If you had a giant bag of D&D dice and you agreed that color didn't matter, you could play this game.

1038
00:59:48,649 --> 00:59:49,297
Rym: Yeah.

1039
00:59:50,662 --> 00:59:51,732
Scott: Or maybe color does matter.

1040
00:59:51,752 --> 00:59:52,499
Scott: You have a whole bunch of D&D.

1041
00:59:53,063 --> 00:59:56,060
Rym: I say color doesn't matter because usually you have a bunch of different colored dice.

1042
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:56,461
Scott: Right.

1043
00:59:56,481 --> 00:59:57,667
Scott: But you could go out and buy.

1044
00:59:57,968 --> 01:00:02,080
Scott: like the thing is, dice end up being more expensive than Icehouse pieces.

1045
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:02,340
Rym: Yes.

1046
01:00:02,421 --> 01:00:05,957
Rym: And it's not like the old days where I really needed 40 different D20s.

1047
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:07,223
Scott: I know, right?

1048
01:00:07,929 --> 01:00:09,400
Scott: Because the first one wasn't lucky enough.

1049
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,572
Rym: Now I just need a sack of D6s.

1050
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:19,530
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1051
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:24,814
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.
