1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,569
Scott: It's Monday January 29th.

2
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:16,062
Scott: I'm Scott and I'm Rym and this is GeekNights Tonight.

3
00:00:16,084 --> 00:00:18,879
Scott: we teach you how removable media formats work.

4
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:21,655
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:25,907
Rym: Man work just keeps getting more and more surreal.

6
00:00:26,488 --> 00:00:32,262
Rym: I had two managers fighting over who got to use my services today Really?

7
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:35,680
Rym: Yeah, I go into work because I was supposed to have jury duty, but they delayed it.

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:41,147
Rym: I have jury duty tomorrow now, which is great because now I can sleep in And I don't tell you not get paid.

9
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:48,177
Rym: I have to waste a vacation day, but I get 40 bucks from my company on top of that.

10
00:00:48,318 --> 00:00:49,843
Scott: Whoa $40.

11
00:00:49,843 --> 00:00:50,848
Rym: Yeah, 40 bucks.

12
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:52,475
Rym: Oh, yeah rolling in the dough.

13
00:00:52,555 --> 00:00:57,809
Scott: That'll pay for the parking And maybe the gas might pay for a lunch.

14
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,174
Scott: maybe a lunch though.

15
00:00:59,314 --> 00:01:00,719
Rym: I'll get to eat something up in Poughkeepsie.

16
00:01:01,382 --> 00:01:02,389
Scott: Oh, you could eat at that place.

17
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:02,932
Scott: that we ate it.

18
00:01:02,952 --> 00:01:04,120
Rym: That was a good place.

19
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,808
Rym: I don't know if that's near the courthouse.

20
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:06,572
Rym: I have no idea.

21
00:01:06,592 --> 00:01:08,140
Rym: I got to look where the courthouse is and everything.

22
00:01:08,842 --> 00:01:12,837
Scott: So what if you take a little long going to get on lunch during the jury duty?

23
00:01:12,918 --> 00:01:13,520
Scott: What could happen?

24
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:20,716
Scott: I just hope what would happen if you went to jury duty and like you went to lunch and they told you you could and You just came back a little late.

25
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:22,305
Scott: What would they do to you?

26
00:01:22,767 --> 00:01:23,149
Scott: not much?

27
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:32,980
Rym: Well, actually there's a whole bunch of rules about if Something comes up numbers you can call to not get arrested or whatever and protocol you have to follow if there's an emergency.

28
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,020
Scott: I'm sure if you're there and something happens that you someone you go up and you say something and then you can go.

29
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:50,099
Rym: Also today I was working in one of the hospitals that we work at and I'm up in the computer room and I'm doing stuff And I go out to find a bathroom and there's no one in the halls anywhere, but people were in the computer room.

30
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:54,895
Rym: So it's kind of surreal like maybe a zombie horror is about to begin.

31
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:55,317
Rym: Mm-hmm.

32
00:01:55,477 --> 00:01:57,325
Rym: So I'm walking around I don't see anyone anywhere.

33
00:01:57,345 --> 00:01:59,595
Rym: So I go to the elevator and the elevators not working.

34
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,420
Rym: Oh Now powers on and there were people in the computer room, which apparently is basically sealed off from the rest of the world.

35
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:15,892
Rym: So eventually I give up and I go down a flight of stairs and the elevator still won't work and I go down another flight Of stairs and then I see a bunch of firemen coming up the stairway.

36
00:02:16,293 --> 00:02:17,316
Rym: Oh carrying hoses.

37
00:02:17,677 --> 00:02:18,300
Scott: you want to go up?

38
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,412
Rym: So I just back away and they all go past me.

39
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,236
Rym: They don't even say a word.

40
00:02:22,698 --> 00:02:22,819
Scott: Mm-hmm.

41
00:02:23,121 --> 00:02:34,252
Rym: so I'm like, huh, so I go down to the lobby and there's a. Basically the security guards have set up a court like they've cordoned off the entrance and they're like no one comes in No one goes out.

42
00:02:35,282 --> 00:02:37,992
Rym: Why me no one goes out no one comes in no one goes out.

43
00:02:38,314 --> 00:02:43,350
Scott: Okay, so I'm like What if there's a fire I'm leaving.

44
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,460
Rym: so I'm like what's going on and they're like there was a fire.

45
00:02:46,461 --> 00:02:48,789
Rym: Like okay, they're like we followed our procedure.

46
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:51,980
Rym: We just can't let anyone go anywhere until they solve it.

47
00:02:53,522 --> 00:02:55,777
Scott: But if there's a fire don't they want everyone to leave?

48
00:02:55,797 --> 00:02:56,018
Scott: No, no,

49
00:02:56,059 --> 00:03:03,220
Rym: no It's actually interestingly most hospitals the procedure for if there's a fire is not to evacuate everyone because that's crazy

50
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:03,762
Scott: Mm-hmm,

51
00:03:04,244 --> 00:03:12,900
Rym: what they do is usually there are safe rooms on every floor of a hospital Mm-hmm, and these rooms are especially ventilated to at least keep people breathing and okay.

52
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:17,080
Rym: And if you have to evacuate people away from a fire you evacuate them there.

53
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:20,735
Rym: I mean, how are you gonna get thousands of people in hospital beds out of a building?

54
00:03:21,277 --> 00:03:21,940
Scott: Yeah, it's not easy.

55
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:23,305
Rym: Yeah, there's all sorts of.

56
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:24,851
Scott: that's why I remember like Katrina.

57
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,337
Scott: A lot of people just got left there.

58
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,720
Scott: Yeah Yeah, it kind of sucks, but it was kind of crazy.

59
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:35,723
Rym: There was this fire but the command everyone, you know was standing downstairs whatever but the computer room didn't have any sort of fire Alarm in it.

60
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:43,160
Scott: Well, no because if you have a big multi-story building Generally, if there's a fire the alarms only go off on the floors that need it, you know.

61
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,600
Scott: And if you're on the right, I forget you split under the fires better like there's a fire on top here.

62
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,785
Scott: Okay, or is on bottom of you?

63
00:03:49,086 --> 00:03:50,371
Scott: Yeah, I forget.

64
00:03:50,893 --> 00:03:52,560
Rym: I submit to you the towering inferno.

65
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:54,928
Scott: Yeah, if you're under the fire, it's cool.

66
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:56,554
Scott: You know, you just go down the stairs.

67
00:03:56,996 --> 00:03:58,100
Rym: Yeah, nothing really came of it.

68
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,003
Rym: It was just interesting.

69
00:03:59,123 --> 00:03:59,304
Scott: Yep.

70
00:03:59,886 --> 00:04:03,317
Rym: More importantly we ordered new microphones.

71
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,248
Scott: Oh shit They haven't arrived yet.

72
00:04:05,268 --> 00:04:07,040
Scott: How long have you been thinking about doing that?

73
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,043
Rym: Yeah, and suddenly on a whim I ordered the same microphone that has been used by the President of the United States since I think Johnson.

74
00:04:13,304 --> 00:04:14,331
Scott: Yeah, okay.

75
00:04:14,512 --> 00:04:16,000
Rym: The Shure SM57 Or 58.

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,601
Rym: Not the 58.

77
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:16,964
Rym: Not the 58, the 57.

78
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:17,305
Scott: There is a 58.

79
00:04:17,305 --> 00:04:17,526
Scott: There is.

80
00:04:17,546 --> 00:04:23,785
Rym: It's slightly different and Crook slightly slow.

81
00:04:23,986 --> 00:04:24,990
Scott: Crook slightly slow.

82
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,449
Scott: Megaton, Megatone, Megatone, Megatone It's not one better than the 57 though.

83
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,574
Scott: It's just a different number.

84
00:04:30,594 --> 00:04:34,569
Rym: They're pretty much exactly Identical in terms of the relative usefulness.

85
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:35,894
Rym: They're just slightly.

86
00:04:35,914 --> 00:04:37,420
Scott: The physical appearance is different.

87
00:04:37,743 --> 00:04:42,130
Rym: Well, they're useful in slightly different ways Which none of you probably would know or care about.

88
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:52,038
Rym: All I have to say is for the vast majority of Podcasters out there because I know a lot of podcasters listen to us There's really no reason to ever buy a microphone better than the Shure SM57.

89
00:04:52,922 --> 00:04:56,240
Scott: No, you could you could buy a better one, but it's not gonna do much for you.

90
00:04:56,561 --> 00:05:02,145
Scott: I mean unless you start distributing your podcast as flak or wave then Then it might do something.

91
00:05:02,165 --> 00:05:12,200
Rym: Or if you also have a good compressor or good SSR and all that other stuff that you probably don't have Yeah, but you start to get diminishing returns on your money like you could get something better and it would be better.

92
00:05:12,602 --> 00:05:16,621
Scott: It just wouldn't be significantly better like it's a hundred bucks for the 57.

93
00:05:16,621 --> 00:05:22,098
Scott: All right, you could do better with a $200 microphone, but it wouldn't be twice as good as the $100 microphone.

94
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:24,689
Scott: It would be like 10% better.

95
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:31,740
Rym: plus how many people have we seen you have you know Like the same kind of mixer we have and they have fancy condenser microphones plugged into it.

96
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,640
Rym: There were a lot of money But they don't have a compressor or any sort of signal thing in the way.

97
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:47,040
Scott: It's all we see people who have more fancy equipment than we do fancier microphones fancier pot filters Lots of compressors in a big-ass mixer and it sounds shittier because they don't know what the fuck they're doing.

98
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,995
Rym: Yeah, there's one podcast in particular.

99
00:05:49,136 --> 00:05:56,608
Scott: Yeah Knowing what you're doing is far more important than spending money and There is a point at which spending money is diminishing returns.

100
00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:00,520
Scott: unless you distribute your podcast on fully mastered super audio CDs.

101
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,787
Rym: Uh, maybe that should be our next extra.

102
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:03,470
Scott: Hmm.

103
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,232
Scott: Sounds good to me.

104
00:06:04,373 --> 00:06:09,649
Scott: Yeah, you know, uh on Thursday I'm finally going a interview for some job.

105
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:10,431
Rym: Oh, really?

106
00:06:10,451 --> 00:06:11,655
Scott: Yeah, and you know what?

107
00:06:11,835 --> 00:06:12,016
Scott: I'm not.

108
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:13,360
Scott: I don't think I'm gonna tell my work.

109
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,397
Scott: I think they're just gonna think I'm working that day.

110
00:06:16,423 --> 00:06:25,320
Scott: Wow I'm more I. it's like I'm working a job and I'm going to interview for other jobs while working the current job.

111
00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:27,007
Rym: So your job is basically paying you.

112
00:06:27,027 --> 00:06:30,280
Scott: that's the kind of stuff that like you see on TV and you think is crazy.

113
00:06:30,481 --> 00:06:33,460
Rym: That's the kind of thing George Costanza would do exactly the guy.

114
00:06:35,244 --> 00:06:38,000
Rym: See now what you got to do and I think this is brilliant.

115
00:06:38,602 --> 00:06:52,987
Scott: Let's say see I would go to my work in the city that day and just tell them I haven't like something to do in The city and then in the afternoon go to the interviews, but I'd walk in there wearing all fancy clothes and they'd be like Hey, what are you all dressed up for?

116
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:55,420
Scott: You know, you should say looking for a better job than this one.

117
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,590
Rym: You should say a date.

118
00:06:56,812 --> 00:06:58,871
Rym: I have a date During the day.

119
00:06:58,891 --> 00:07:02,953
Rym: Yeah All right, a friend is in town from Hong Kong.

120
00:07:02,993 --> 00:07:04,419
Rym: I haven't seen her in six years.

121
00:07:06,202 --> 00:07:11,580
Scott: You're really not good at this whole making up an excuse thing Because it's much better to just not say anything than to lie.

122
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,869
Scott: If you don't say anything then you don't have anything to cover up.

123
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,294
Rym: now, here's my brilliant plan.

124
00:07:15,676 --> 00:07:16,660
Rym: Let's say you get a new job.

125
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:29,144
Scott: Just I figure on the odd chance that I bump into someone from my work in the city Even though the interview is so far away from my works office on the odd chance that I do bump into someone like way downtown Where this office is?

126
00:07:29,686 --> 00:07:32,959
Scott: I'm just gonna be like, yeah, I mean if you're in front of the job, what you can do about it.

127
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:34,845
Scott: That's my plan.

128
00:07:34,865 --> 00:07:36,051
Rym: But don't say you get the job, right?

129
00:07:36,493 --> 00:07:37,940
Scott: You should know if I want this job.

130
00:07:38,262 --> 00:07:40,255
Scott: I'm just going to interview any job.

131
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:47,340
Rym: Yeah, so Why even tell your company that you just collect a paycheck as long as you can?

132
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,893
Scott: Because then there might be legal issues that you get me sued.

133
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:51,199
Scott: That's the only reason I don't do that.

134
00:07:51,622 --> 00:07:59,858
Scott: well, otherwise I would because technically what would happen is Everything I do is a work for hire for the company I'm at now.

135
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:05,340
Scott: So if I started working at another company that my current company would own the work I did for the second one.

136
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:06,566
Rym: No, no, no, no, no.

137
00:08:06,606 --> 00:08:07,571
Rym: You know how you do that?

138
00:08:07,892 --> 00:08:09,420
Rym: You ask for a two-week vacation.

139
00:08:10,061 --> 00:08:10,845
Rym: Okay, just be like.

140
00:08:11,086 --> 00:08:12,714
Rym: can I burn my vacation is whatever.

141
00:08:12,734 --> 00:08:19,800
Rym: I need a two-week vacation and Start your new job as soon as your vacation starts and then just don't just tell your work at the end of vacation.

142
00:08:19,902 --> 00:08:20,778
Rym: Oh, by the way, I quit.

143
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:24,348
Scott: It's alright, but I don't know.

144
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:26,960
Rym: it depends if your company will pay you all your own use.

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,428
Scott: Let's remember when I go to these jobs I'm gonna be you know Because I already have a job that I'm safe in.

146
00:08:32,869 --> 00:08:35,799
Scott: I'm gonna heap demands on whoever wants me to work for them.

147
00:08:36,841 --> 00:08:55,645
Scott: Like I'm going to take off these this week and two days for Otakon and the week afterwards and I'm Taking off this and I'm gonna go see my grandma in Florida and you're gonna pay me more money than they paid me And I'm gonna show up at this time and leave at this time and I'm never gonna work later on a weekend and you can Shove it if you don't like that.

148
00:08:55,705 --> 00:08:58,860
Rym: See you I interviewed like that even when I didn't have a stable job.

149
00:08:59,142 --> 00:09:00,999
Rym: Yeah, I'm real picky when it comes to job.

150
00:09:01,702 --> 00:09:08,380
Scott: The only reason I'd interview like that before was you know, my previous two times ago I was like I need a co-op or I can't graduate.

151
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:13,300
Scott: So I was like give me whatever and the lat the preview the time after that which is my current job.

152
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,022
Scott: I interviewed.

153
00:09:14,223 --> 00:09:15,407
Scott: I have to get at my mom's house.

154
00:09:15,447 --> 00:09:17,252
Scott: I'll take it now.

155
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:20,383
Rym: I can interview like that for oh, here's another way You could swing it.

156
00:09:20,885 --> 00:09:22,813
Rym: So say your new job starts in a month.

157
00:09:22,994 --> 00:09:23,837
Rym: That's like a standard.

158
00:09:23,877 --> 00:09:25,580
Rym: No a month from now I'm gonna start at this new job.

159
00:09:25,721 --> 00:09:27,549
Scott: I don't know the job that I currently have.

160
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:29,698
Scott: I started like the Monday after her.

161
00:09:29,798 --> 00:09:31,605
Scott: I they Gave me an offer.

162
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:33,115
Rym: Well, I gave IBM a month's notice.

163
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:37,277
Rym: I was real nice to them Oh, but anyway, so let's say the job starts in a month.

164
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:37,961
Rym: even swing it Like.

165
00:09:38,002 --> 00:09:39,658
Rym: I'd like to start the first of next month.

166
00:09:39,922 --> 00:09:47,802
Rym: Mm-hmm Just stop showing up to your normal job and don't have a job and just collect money until they fire you and then start the New job.

167
00:09:48,043 --> 00:09:49,932
Rym: and if you make and then have a bet I have a pool.

168
00:09:49,952 --> 00:09:54,115
Rym: if you make it the whole month Without getting caught just quit.

169
00:09:54,498 --> 00:09:59,033
Scott: Yeah Thing is do I do anything during the month to keep from getting caught?

170
00:09:59,113 --> 00:09:59,735
Scott: cuz they those.

171
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:05,477
Scott: the odds are in a month that Someone will email me and ask me to do something and it might be something that takes five minutes.

172
00:10:05,497 --> 00:10:06,020
Scott: Should I do it?

173
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:06,642
Rym: I don't know.

174
00:10:06,663 --> 00:10:08,300
Rym: It depends on what kind of pool you want to set up.

175
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:08,943
Rym: I mean how.

176
00:10:09,204 --> 00:10:10,570
Rym: how about what do you want the odds to be?

177
00:10:10,631 --> 00:10:11,394
Rym: What's the over-under?

178
00:10:11,414 --> 00:10:13,923
Scott: I don't know Who's gonna bet.

179
00:10:14,745 --> 00:10:15,086
Rym: I'd bet.

180
00:10:15,427 --> 00:10:17,032
Rym: All right, I'd bet like I'm ready legal.

181
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,640
Rym: Oh, we'd be breaking all sorts of laws.

182
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:20,122
Scott: All right.

183
00:10:20,444 --> 00:10:21,448
Scott: All right, right.

184
00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:22,333
Scott: You should do some news.

185
00:10:22,614 --> 00:10:29,900
Rym: So in the news It looks like Apple is starting to run into the same kind of trouble Microsoft used to run into in Europe.

186
00:10:30,784 --> 00:10:31,688
Scott: Oh, we we.

187
00:10:31,849 --> 00:10:44,779
Rym: well it turns out that Norway now It's not the Norwegian government straight up But it's the Norwegian Consumer Council Which has a lot of clout has analyzed fair play and iTunes and Apple and Apple's DRM.

188
00:10:45,081 --> 00:10:59,897
Rym: you know fair play and the iPod and everything and They have determined that iTunes and fair play and the iTunes store Violate all sorts of laws and rules and regulations and contract law in Norway.

189
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:02,735
Scott: all sorts of laws Not just one or two good God.

190
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:09,904
Rym: And in fact, they have given Apple a fairly strong ultimatum that if they do not correct these problems They will be suing Apple.

191
00:11:10,445 --> 00:11:19,680
Rym: and the end result if they win and I don't see many ways for them to lose Would simply be that Apple would not be able to do business in Norway.

192
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,740
Scott: I think Apple would just choose not to do business in Norway rather than comply because no lying would be bad for Apple.

193
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,468
Rym: Now here's the thing.

194
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:33,026
Rym: Sweden and Finland Have basically said yes These people are exactly right.

195
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:34,570
Scott: Apple would pull out of them too.

196
00:11:34,691 --> 00:11:38,000
Scott: It would take like literally many many countries.

197
00:11:38,721 --> 00:11:47,577
Rym: just France and Germany Apparently are also coming right on board with this.

198
00:11:47,658 --> 00:11:48,965
Scott: possibly I don't know.

199
00:11:48,985 --> 00:11:50,174
Scott: I still don't know if that's enough.

200
00:11:50,214 --> 00:11:51,040
Scott: That's almost enough.

201
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,984
Rym: Oh, it might not be enough.

202
00:11:52,024 --> 00:11:57,727
Rym: But even if you know, Apple just says alright gives him the finger and pulls out That's a pretty big PR blow.

203
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:00,720
Scott: Yeah, and it's a pretty big money hit - it's also a stat.

204
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,100
Scott: It's not as big as the money hit they would take by opening up the fair play.

205
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:11,058
Scott: That's the thing is it's like basically because Apple chose to be assholes and use these DRM.

206
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:21,480
Scott: now They're stuck in a situation where okay, we can either give up, you know a bajillion dollars now or Give up two bajillion dollars.

207
00:12:22,371 --> 00:12:23,020
Rym: Well, it depends.

208
00:12:23,461 --> 00:12:31,125
Rym: I mean how many people buy an iPod just because they want to use the iTunes store as opposed to because as far as they're concerned iPod means mp3.

209
00:12:31,145 --> 00:12:32,452
Scott: Well, it's more an issue.

210
00:12:32,592 --> 00:12:34,000
Scott: It's more the opposite issue.

211
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,020
Scott: It's that people who use the iTunes store can only use iPods.

212
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:41,202
Scott: It's it's not iPods can only use the iTunes true But how many?

213
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:52,960
Rym: I really wonder how many people who use the iTunes store as opposed to people like us who just use iPods Would seriously think about if they were able buying a non iPod?

214
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:59,760
Rym: I think those people at least 90% of them are never going to abandon Apple unless Apple start sacrificing babies to their God.

215
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:08,371
Scott: But I think people would you know buy iPods and they would just load them from some other music store with regular Mp3s like a music or that other one, but that's not.

216
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:15,104
Rym: the issue is just more specifically that one fair play only works on iPods pretty much.

217
00:13:15,124 --> 00:13:19,520
Scott: Yeah, if you buy a song from the iTunes store, you can only play it in iTunes or on an iPod.

218
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:19,962
Scott: That's it.

219
00:13:20,062 --> 00:13:22,671
Rym: They're saying that's unfair restraint of trade restrictive.

220
00:13:22,732 --> 00:13:26,087
Rym: Whatever it is now beyond all that There's a lot more to this.

221
00:13:26,107 --> 00:13:42,840
Scott: That's the reason that Apple has always Continuously said even if the music companies didn't want it We would still have the DRM because they don't want you buying songs from the Apple iTunes music store Playing them on your Zune or your cheap-ass $5 Hong Kong mp3 player.

222
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:48,928
Rym: Yeah, I guess everyone has to remember that as much as you like Apple or any company like that like Nintendo Nintendo is not your friend.

223
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:51,220
Rym: No, they're no wants your money.

224
00:13:51,562 --> 00:13:58,479
Rym: They might do nice things to you to get your money from you but in the end their sole purpose is to get money out of your pocket

225
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:06,256
Scott: and Sometimes they do things that you like and therefore you can say, okay you did something I like you could have my money and sometimes they do things you don't like.

226
00:14:06,276 --> 00:14:08,779
Scott: so you say no You cannot have my money this time.

227
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:15,980
Rym: Well, apparently the problem stem not just from fairplay but from the iTunes and user license agreement in total.

228
00:14:17,102 --> 00:14:27,348
Rym: now the very interesting thing is that almost every argument they made against this EULA is equally valid against almost every software EULA And user license agreement.

229
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,840
Rym: that thing you click OK on without reading.

230
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,531
Scott: You know the thing that says I agree I do not agree when you install software that thing.

231
00:14:34,953 --> 00:14:35,394
Scott: well one.

232
00:14:35,414 --> 00:14:41,759
Rym: according to Scandinavian law Any written agreement it between two parties must favor both parties.

233
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:49,149
Scott: You can't I can't write a contract that says Rym agrees to give me $100 and Scott will kick Rym in the shin Pretty much.

234
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:51,926
Rym: I mean, I don't know the actual law but it seems that there's.

235
00:14:52,046 --> 00:15:05,578
Rym: there are protections that agreements cannot be exploitative and There are things where in an agreement between a strong party and a weak party The weak party has special protections outside of the contract signed and rights that cannot be waived.

236
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:07,588
Scott: Hmm Alright, um

237
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:23,955
Rym: also this is a big one apparently the iTunes and user license agreement contract Which almost every software license and many hardware licenses in the world has a clause near the end That says something like we can change this terms at any time without notice any reason whatever.

238
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:25,400
Scott: every contract says that shit.

239
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:33,120
Rym: Well according to Scandinavian law, all right This is not kosher and you can't just change that sort of thing.

240
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:42,470
Rym: And in fact changing the terms of a contract like that would either invalidate the contract or they'd be forced to Honor the contract as it was signed and written until it expired.

241
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:42,611
Rym: Yeah.

242
00:15:42,631 --> 00:15:58,000
Scott: Well, there was something that there's something similar to that US law I'm not a hundred percent sure but recently like singular change their text messaging rates and that you know If you called singular you could get out of your contract without paying the fee because they changed the text messaging rates.

243
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:09,059
Scott: Verizon also changed the text messaging rates But apparently they got out of it and you can't cancel your Verizon contract by some loophole because Verizon is smarter than you.

244
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:24,698
Rym: Ah Well, another big one here is that apparently the iTunes contract basically says that it'll follow I guess American law, but it the contract tries to specify what jurisdiction the contract should be understood in and enforced by.

245
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:41,000
Rym: According to this consumer group any product that is marketed to Norwegian customers in Norway is subject to Norwegian law and Norwegian jurisdiction Period and that cannot be waived in a boilerplate contract.

246
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:50,380
Scott: So if I'm a French guy and you're a French guy, which we're not and we're in France I can't write a contract that says yeah Only the American law counts on this contract.

247
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:58,660
Rym: Well, you might be able to I mean in the US there are a lot of contracts to say Well, the terms of this contract shall be interpreted as per the rules and blah blah blah of Illinois.

248
00:16:58,922 --> 00:17:03,148
Scott: Well, yes states are different thing different countries Yeah, but I don't know what other countries laws are.

249
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,519
Rym: but Norway very specifically seems to say that this is not the case.

250
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,190
Rym: Specifically because not only is this a contract whatever.

251
00:17:10,651 --> 00:17:13,160
Rym: the product is marketed in Norway to Norwegians.

252
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:14,665
Rym: It's not like this.

253
00:17:14,724 --> 00:17:19,722
Rym: is them going to America and buying something that is marketed there is provided there There's.

254
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,691
Scott: yeah, they have the Norwegian iTunes store, they've got it.

255
00:17:22,771 --> 00:17:23,895
Scott: Norwegian language.

256
00:17:24,396 --> 00:17:25,240
Scott: what language they speak?

257
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:28,069
Scott: Norwegians anyway Swedish.

258
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,120
Rym: it goes on and on and it's pretty interesting article.

259
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:34,411
Rym: I really can't wait to see Apple has responded to this at all.

260
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:37,502
Scott: as far as I can tell I guess that if Norway keeps Pushing it.

261
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:41,117
Scott: They'll eventually just leave Norway and stop selling their shit there.

262
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:46,680
Rym: Yeah I just don't know what ramifications will come of that if anything Apple not making money for Norwegian people anymore.

263
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,944
Rym: Well, I know one thing will happen.

264
00:17:48,606 --> 00:17:49,368
Rym: We'll talk about it.

265
00:17:49,649 --> 00:17:53,280
Scott: Yeah, so, um, what language do people in Norway speak?

266
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,765
Rym: I'd wager the Norwegian speak Norwegian.

267
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:58,735
Scott: I didn't realize there was a language Norwegian.

268
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:03,407
Rym: Well according to Wikipedia Bokumol and nin yorsk.

269
00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:06,580
Rym: I don't know if those are dialects as Norwegian or if there are three.

270
00:18:07,202 --> 00:18:08,406
Rym: I don't know if they're in parentheses.

271
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:09,409
Rym: I'm not going to look in.

272
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:12,580
Scott: Norwegian is a Germanic language spoken primarily in Norway.

273
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:17,833
Scott: I just if you click on the word Norwegian it gives you a.

274
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,079
Rym: but I don't know what's up with Bokumol and nin yorsk.

275
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,599
Scott: Oh, it's closely related to and generally mutually intelligible with Swedish and Danish.

276
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:28,739
Rym: The more you know.

277
00:18:30,574 --> 00:18:30,740
Rym: Anyway.

278
00:18:31,841 --> 00:18:40,327
Scott: So one problem I've always had I don't know about you it when getting people to try out Linux is that they They can't fucking install it.

279
00:18:40,508 --> 00:18:41,592
Scott: and it's you know, it.

280
00:18:42,195 --> 00:18:45,579
Scott: it's not that they can't install it It's that they can't you know get a CD.

281
00:18:45,921 --> 00:18:50,213
Scott: They don't know how to download an ISO burn a CD and boot the CD.

282
00:18:50,474 --> 00:18:56,616
Scott: if you can get them to do those three things Then installing it and playing around in the live CD is no problem.

283
00:18:56,636 --> 00:19:00,028
Rym: Well, it doesn't help that in Windows You can't just burn an ISO.

284
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:03,140
Rym: You need special software, even though it's built into Windows.

285
00:19:03,362 --> 00:19:05,260
Rym: There's an ISO burner built into Windows.

286
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:10,158
Rym: You can use an MSI to unlock it and then you can just right-click on an ISO and say burn.

287
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:14,069
Scott: Yep Anyway, anyway, that's what a rims pet peeves.

288
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,636
Rym: Oh, yeah, you know, I have a few pet peeves.

289
00:19:16,776 --> 00:19:16,997
Scott: Yes.

290
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:19,902
Scott: So anyway This isn't.

291
00:19:20,022 --> 00:19:26,620
Scott: that is one thing that someone finally thought up and that is to make a Windows program that installs Linux.

292
00:19:26,864 --> 00:19:27,416
Rym: What do you say?

293
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:34,260
Scott: So you go to this website and you download an exe file and you run it which is something every Windows user knows how to.

294
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,363
Rym: Of course they do.

295
00:19:35,403 --> 00:19:36,686
Rym: That's how they get all that spyware.

296
00:19:36,886 --> 00:19:53,620
Scott: Of course and you do this and What will happen is this exe will allow you to format your hard drive make a little partition for wait for Linux to go on It'll install Linux to the partition and when you reboot the computer grub will be there and the whole thing is a go.

297
00:19:54,203 --> 00:19:55,974
Rym: So does it leave your windows intact?

298
00:19:56,015 --> 00:19:56,961
Rym: is just dual boot it it.

299
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:00,258
Scott: not only does it leave your windows intact, but it can handle the.

300
00:20:01,761 --> 00:20:06,455
Scott: You know the NTFS with all the NTFS 3g support and all sorts of other good stuff.

301
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:11,800
Scott: Wow, it basically is Extracts a live CD to a partition on your hard drive.

302
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,740
Scott: That's how it works right now and of course will work better in the future.

303
00:20:16,161 --> 00:20:22,866
Scott: The only disadvantage of this is whereas with the live CD you can try out Linux risk-free This isn't really risk-free.

304
00:20:22,886 --> 00:20:25,414
Scott: You're installing Linux and partitioning your hard drive.

305
00:20:25,454 --> 00:20:29,085
Rym: Yeah, more importantly your live Resizing a partition.

306
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:29,808
Scott: Yeah.

307
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,354
Scott: Well, I don't know if it resizes.

308
00:20:31,414 --> 00:20:33,080
Scott: Maybe it only works if you have some free space.

309
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,384
Scott: I haven't I haven't looked into it.

310
00:20:34,645 --> 00:20:39,040
Scott: I'm gonna try it on this computer tomorrow at work and I will get more information.

311
00:20:39,261 --> 00:20:43,473
Rym: Yeah, I guess the news here isn't that you know the specifics of this implementation.

312
00:20:43,513 --> 00:20:43,955
Rym: It's just that.

313
00:20:44,396 --> 00:20:45,319
Rym: what a good idea.

314
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:46,617
Rym: Look into this.

315
00:20:47,701 --> 00:20:54,687
Scott: If you're someone who's wanted to try out, you know, Debian, the only one that works now is Debian Linux Which is well think about it.

316
00:20:55,109 --> 00:20:58,120
Scott: Debian's hard to install but now it's not.

317
00:20:59,502 --> 00:21:13,636
Scott: And once you see the difference really between Debian and Ubuntu Ubuntu is you know, some of the packages in Ubuntu have different patches, you know, like Ubuntu comes with the real Firefox yeah, and Debian doesn't and such like that.

318
00:21:13,737 --> 00:21:17,317
Scott: Well Debian also doesn't come with really software.

319
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:21,293
Scott: by default You have to install a bunch of stuff or as Ubuntu comes by Ubuntu.

320
00:21:21,734 --> 00:21:22,317
Scott: Yeah, stop it.

321
00:21:22,718 --> 00:21:27,717
Scott: by default It comes with Firefox and openoffice and all that stuff and in Debian none of that stuff comes in.

322
00:21:27,737 --> 00:21:29,122
Scott: you have to go and get It yourself.

323
00:21:29,483 --> 00:21:30,406
Scott: Well, you don't go get it.

324
00:21:30,426 --> 00:21:31,208
Scott: You just install it.

325
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,700
Scott: It's when you if you just install Debian, there's like nothing there.

326
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,467
Scott: Yeah, it's like empty.

327
00:21:36,547 --> 00:21:37,611
Scott: It's a barren wasteland.

328
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:40,724
Scott: You have to go install all the software you get a command line You take LS.

329
00:21:40,784 --> 00:21:42,351
Rym: it doesn't answer because it's not bash.

330
00:21:42,392 --> 00:21:42,954
Rym: It's nothing.

331
00:21:43,236 --> 00:21:43,939
Rym: Yeah, it's just raw.

332
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:47,589
Scott: This Debian installer will leave you like that.

333
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:50,038
Rym: Maybe it will raw binary to the processor.

334
00:21:50,399 --> 00:22:09,500
Scott: Yeah the point is is that now you can go to this website, which is goodbye - microsoft.com and You click on the Debian logo and it says Debian dot exe and you save it to your desktop or wherever and you run it And it'll install Debian and it's that's crazy.

335
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:17,882
Rym: Wow, imagine going back in time to when you were trying to install like Red Hat 6 on something and showing yourself that yeah No, wait, check this out.

336
00:22:18,002 --> 00:22:35,655
Scott: Ubuntu is planning on copying this feature and I imagine we're gonna get Ubuntu dot exe some time in the future and The things that they're planning to have working in their Ubuntu dot exe are crazy Like they're planning to have it configure your network.

337
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:41,264
Scott: when the first time it boots Configure X the first time it boots Automatically generate FS tab.

338
00:22:41,304 --> 00:22:45,775
Scott: the first time it boots all sorts of crazy stuff the first time you boot it up.

339
00:22:46,216 --> 00:22:55,929
Scott: and that's pretty awesome things of the day.

340
00:22:56,773 --> 00:23:00,970
Scott: And I'm sure you all out there know that we are fans of f1 here at GeekNights.

341
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:05,365
Rym: I'm about as much of a fan as f1 of f1 as I can be of any motorsport.

342
00:23:05,626 --> 00:23:05,867
Scott: Yeah.

343
00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:10,059
Scott: Anyway There's this thing on dig about f1 recently.

344
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:13,070
Scott: It was a picture of a terrible f1 accident.

345
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,639
Scott: There's no video which is kind of sad.

346
00:23:15,122 --> 00:23:16,390
Rym: Well, I guess it's very thankful.

347
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,857
Rym: I wouldn't want to see a video of that.

348
00:23:17,937 --> 00:23:23,740
Scott: You may have already seen it, you know, because he got 5592 digs because it was so terrible.

349
00:23:24,243 --> 00:23:30,449
Scott: But anyway, let me read you the The dig description of this picture because what else can I say about it?

350
00:23:30,589 --> 00:23:32,222
Rym: Yeah I mean you really just got to look at the picture.

351
00:23:32,706 --> 00:23:40,789
Scott: Yeah Excessive downforce during a shunt led to damage of key suspension resulting in going off leaving horrific wreck.

352
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,817
Rym: now That doesn't sound like much does it?

353
00:23:42,897 --> 00:23:45,730
Scott: but according to the prof getting help was no longer possible.

354
00:23:46,332 --> 00:23:48,922
Rym: When you see the picture you realize what that was all about.

355
00:23:48,962 --> 00:23:53,398
Rym: That's a very clinical discussion of something Breathtaking to put it lightly.

356
00:23:53,418 --> 00:24:00,890
Scott: Yes, so if you You know like to look at accidents you really need to see this picture.

357
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:07,640
Rym: However, the reason it got over 5,000 digs I would consider it possibly not safe for work Especially if you're a little squeamish.

358
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,748
Rym: you might not want to look at this.

359
00:24:09,792 --> 00:24:11,175
Scott: Yeah, check this thing out.

360
00:24:11,256 --> 00:24:12,298
Scott: it's it's it's.

361
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:17,593
Rym: I get the chance I get the chills just looking at it and I mean my Reaction.

362
00:24:17,955 --> 00:24:20,929
Rym: it took me a few minutes to realize exactly what I was looking at.

363
00:24:21,271 --> 00:24:26,488
Rym: yeah, if Scott hadn't told me it was an f1 accident, I might have guessed eventually from what remained.

364
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:30,470
Rym: but Yeah, there's no way that guy could have gotten any help.

365
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:33,015
Scott: Yeah, all right.

366
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,219
Scott: There's just no words.

367
00:24:34,902 --> 00:24:37,030
Scott: So I'm sure I guess there's probably a thousand words.

368
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:39,701
Rym: I'm sure you're all familiar with Frank Zappa.

369
00:24:39,781 --> 00:24:44,759
Rym: If you're not I suggest you read Wikipedia Now listen to some fucking music.

370
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,341
Scott: what the hell.

371
00:24:45,381 --> 00:25:06,169
Rym: now aside from being you know a great musician and a great man Frank Zappa Did a lot for America and more specifically for the First Amendment than most people and a lot of people don't really know these days Exactly how important he was You see for all you youngins out there and even for us because we I was like three or four when this was going on.

372
00:25:06,531 --> 00:25:06,973
Scott: I was four.

373
00:25:06,993 --> 00:25:10,530
Scott: I was I was in nursery school and my brother was being born.

374
00:25:10,971 --> 00:25:13,840
Rym: there used to be a big issue in America where you know.

375
00:25:13,901 --> 00:25:19,960
Rym: today it's like hip-hop music is ruining youth and Terrorists are out there killing people in the 50s.

376
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,810
Scott: It was OMG Elvis is moving his hips back and forth.

377
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:35,370
Rym: Yep, it seems like at any given point There is a bunch of prudes who think that whatever people like at any given juncture in time is Somehow going to bring about Satanism and anarchy and doom the end of the world.

378
00:25:35,732 --> 00:25:37,219
Rym: Well, there is this huge movement.

379
00:25:37,239 --> 00:25:38,264
Scott: It's okay to have nukes.

380
00:25:38,284 --> 00:25:39,269
Scott: You just can't say fuck.

381
00:25:39,772 --> 00:26:06,878
Rym: There was a huge movement among scary conservative not jobs in America to Basically overturn the First Amendment which guarantees among other things freedom of speech and this led to among other things Congress basically sitting down and having hearings to try to figure out how to censor things in rock and roll music and radio and television and literature that were somehow Damaging to America or dangerous.

382
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:12,649
Rym: Yeah, and of all the people Frank Zappa Really came through here.

383
00:26:13,091 --> 00:26:24,025
Rym: Not only did he testify before Congress multiple times at length and not only if you can ever get Transcripts or he read anything about Frank Zappa testifying before the Senate.

384
00:26:24,045 --> 00:26:27,930
Rym: he to put it in modern terms couldn't them Frank Zappa.

385
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:30,197
Rym: But I mean, I don't know what you think you musicians.

386
00:26:30,237 --> 00:26:32,044
Rym: Frank Zappa is a very intelligent man.

387
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,590
Rym: He's a very upstanding man.

388
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,434
Rym: He's a wonderful man.

389
00:26:34,474 --> 00:26:35,498
Rym: He's one of my heroes.

390
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:40,483
Rym: He's not quite on the part of that Canadian guy No, but he's a really great guy.

391
00:26:40,503 --> 00:26:46,594
Rym: Yep, and he put the Senate in its place and While that was awesome.

392
00:26:46,995 --> 00:26:52,170
Rym: There is a video of another incident where he put some people in their places, which is my thing of the day.

393
00:26:52,271 --> 00:26:58,120
Scott: Yes, he was on CNN crossfire, which is a show that I believe still exists, right?

394
00:26:58,401 --> 00:27:01,090
Rym: Yeah now it was four people three other people.

395
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:01,833
Rym: I forget their names.

396
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:03,700
Rym: I don't care Robert Novak.

397
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:04,684
Scott: It was one of them.

398
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:06,190
Scott: He's yeah, he's a famous guy.

399
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:08,440
Rym: There was that Washington, whatever guy.

400
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,384
Rym: Yeah God anyway.

401
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:14,120
Scott: Anyway, it's even if he you don't care about the free speech issue.

402
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,810
Scott: Just watch this to see what CNN crossfire looked like in 1986.

403
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:24,370
Rym: Yeah Wow, I'll start by saying that I agree with every single thing that Frank Zappa said.

404
00:27:25,052 --> 00:27:27,700
Scott: I also agree with every single thing Frank Zappa said.

405
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,706
Rym: now the interesting thing is video.

406
00:27:30,087 --> 00:27:43,490
Rym: you think that today You know you watch say Jon Stewart or someone cool on a show where someone's stupid or crazy Or some nutjob conservative who's like we got a band gaze and we got a band blah blah.

407
00:27:43,971 --> 00:27:44,212
Rym: And what?

408
00:27:44,232 --> 00:27:44,513
Rym: are you?

409
00:27:44,553 --> 00:27:45,175
Rym: a terrorist?

410
00:27:45,777 --> 00:27:49,870
Rym: the same thing was going on in the 80s, but back then it was what are you an anarchist?

411
00:27:51,351 --> 00:27:56,890
Rym: And this bit like this starts out like, you know crossfire and it's supposed to be about you know, rock music.

412
00:27:57,071 --> 00:27:58,457
Rym: Are these lyrics controversial?

413
00:27:58,497 --> 00:28:01,350
Rym: What should we do about them is should we do anything about them?

414
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:07,789
Rym: but right away the tone of the video is more along the lines of how are we going to censor these horrible words?

415
00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:10,716
Rym: and Frank Zappa is I?

416
00:28:11,037 --> 00:28:15,269
Rym: I can't imagine the amount of patience it took to not punch all of them in the face.

417
00:28:15,865 --> 00:28:21,386
Scott: Yeah Imagine like trying to argue with Hitler that Jews are all right, and then he's just.

418
00:28:21,486 --> 00:28:25,257
Scott: you know, he's not getting violent He's just yelling at you all his crazy Hitlerism.

419
00:28:25,298 --> 00:28:26,601
Scott: Yeah, and how long did?

420
00:28:26,782 --> 00:28:29,690
Scott: how long could you go without just kicking him in the nuts?

421
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:35,950
Rym: I mean, he'll ask you a question and then as soon as you start to answer He'll interrupt you saying that your answer was wrong.

422
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:44,530
Scott: All right Go find a KKK guy and try to argue with him that black people are okay and See how long it takes before you kick him in the nuts, but this was three on one.

423
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:45,895
Rym: So we got a little.

424
00:28:45,955 --> 00:28:50,490
Scott: it was three on one and somehow Frank Zappa didn't kick anyone the nuts.

425
00:28:50,610 --> 00:29:01,395
Rym: I mean he made these three people look like fools straight up and I have so much respect for the band and the moment about seven minutes in where he basically just says, you know What fuck you guys?

426
00:29:01,415 --> 00:29:04,407
Rym: Yeah, and with a perfectly straight face and they just lose it.

427
00:29:04,989 --> 00:29:12,438
Rym: and If you don't know how great a man Frank Zappa is or if you don't just watch this video The it stands alone.

428
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:14,947
Rym: it stands for itself and for everything.

429
00:29:14,968 --> 00:29:15,530
Rym: That's wonderful.

430
00:29:16,152 --> 00:29:20,728
Scott: He's not as great as Lieutenant General Romeo Alain Diado, no, he's not.

431
00:29:21,391 --> 00:29:25,947
Rym: However, dire Frank Zappa is definitely in my top 100 people ever.

432
00:29:26,368 --> 00:29:38,385
Rym: Yep Romeo Dalek also the fact that he said that the Reagan administration and effectively Neoconservativism is going to push America to a the a theocratic fascist state.

433
00:29:38,907 --> 00:29:39,970
Scott: Oh, wait a minute, huh?

434
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:41,889
Scott: Where have I seen that before?

435
00:29:42,191 --> 00:29:48,276
Rym: I love how the three people when he says that laugh and they're like, yeah, you're joking But seriously, you can't actually have that opinion.

436
00:29:48,296 --> 00:29:48,838
Rym: That's crazy.

437
00:29:48,878 --> 00:29:51,887
Rym: He's like, I'm dead serious and it's funny.

438
00:29:51,947 --> 00:29:59,964
Scott: looking back in retrospect I'm feeling like we're more Theistic fascist state now than we were in 86.

439
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:00,467
Scott: What do you think?

440
00:30:00,628 --> 00:30:01,009
Rym: I don't know.

441
00:30:01,471 --> 00:30:05,787
Rym: It's a little from column a little column B. Yeah, I mean there's gay marriage in some states now.

442
00:30:05,827 --> 00:30:08,502
Scott: We're getting a little better Yeah, but are we also have Utah?

443
00:30:08,965 --> 00:30:13,675
Scott: Yeah Okay, right.

444
00:30:13,735 --> 00:30:23,210
Rym: so being Monday and realizing that many people don't actually know a lot about this We're gonna have a little bit of fun and talk on a very non technical level about all the different kinds.

445
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,675
Scott: Well slightly technical level.

446
00:30:25,578 --> 00:30:28,087
Rym: I'd say that we'll talk on your parents.

447
00:30:28,147 --> 00:30:28,769
Rym: technical level.

448
00:30:29,431 --> 00:30:30,856
Rym: No, we're not gonna go grandparents.

449
00:30:31,137 --> 00:30:33,044
Rym: Okay, but we're not gonna go six-year-old kids.

450
00:30:33,526 --> 00:30:44,687
Scott: Hopefully your parents are educated But basically of media storing data the various ways and hopefully you're not old because if you're old And your parents are grandparents then we're talking to you.

451
00:30:46,872 --> 00:30:54,889
Rym: But I mean, you know you floppy drives and CD-ROMs and flash memory and SD cards and modems and all these, you know, HD DVD.

452
00:30:55,871 --> 00:31:00,290
Rym: I wonder how many of you actually know how they work on at least a basic level because some of it's kind of interesting.

453
00:31:00,712 --> 00:31:06,338
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know for all these years, you know, you just put a floppy disk in your computer You put a CD in there and burn it.

454
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,690
Scott: But do you know actually know how that works?

455
00:31:09,031 --> 00:31:11,827
Scott: You know why it works the way it works, you know why.

456
00:31:11,987 --> 00:31:20,607
Scott: you know It's pretty interesting and it's not too complicated if you don't worry about the details and it all really comes down into two basic categories analog and digital.

457
00:31:21,572 --> 00:31:22,937
Rym: We don't need to go into great detail.

458
00:31:22,957 --> 00:31:25,306
Rym: In fact, we talked about that at length in one of our older.

459
00:31:25,386 --> 00:31:31,170
Rym: how computers work shows Yep, but basically you can break down all kinds of storing data into these two categories.

460
00:31:31,613 --> 00:31:33,970
Rym: Digital means you turn it into ones and zeros.

461
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:34,832
Rym: That's it.

462
00:31:35,273 --> 00:31:35,995
Rym: ones and zeros.

463
00:31:36,035 --> 00:31:46,100
Rym: you quantify or quantize things into a form where ones and zeros and some sort of data Structure can describe it as well as you would ever want to describe it.

464
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:52,033
Rym: Mm-hmm and analog data is a more fuzzy set of Like say.

465
00:31:52,073 --> 00:31:56,309
Rym: digital is zero and one analog is any value between zero and one.

466
00:31:56,751 --> 00:32:10,633
Rym: yep, however analog is that doesn't mean that analog has perfect resolution or that digital skip steps because you can make digital that Skip steps so small that there's no way a human could tell and you can make analog that skips so many steps It's not?

467
00:32:10,874 --> 00:32:13,973
Rym: you couldn't even recognize a song in that format Mm-hmm.

468
00:32:14,395 --> 00:32:14,697
Rym: There's all.

469
00:32:14,717 --> 00:32:27,270
Rym: there's a fallacy out there among a lot of very audiophile golden ear types that old analog media for audio was somehow superior when in fact, it's vastly Inferior is incredibly inferior.

470
00:32:27,331 --> 00:32:32,920
Scott: I mean you mean it's true that you know Vinyl record does sound different from a CD and you might.

471
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:36,451
Scott: you might prefer the sound of vinyl record to the sound of a CD.

472
00:32:36,491 --> 00:32:37,193
Scott: that's preference.

473
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:37,815
Scott: That's fine.

474
00:32:37,835 --> 00:32:53,890
Scott: But there is no arguing that the quality, you know, the numerical quality the quantifiable quality of the audio that is on a compact disc is Beyond compare when it comes to at least a vinyl record.

475
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:57,565
Scott: You need a super audio CD or a wave file to beat a CD.

476
00:32:58,107 --> 00:32:58,710
Scott: It's pretty tough.

477
00:32:59,631 --> 00:33:00,918
Rym: So analog media, I mean what?

478
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,310
Rym: what analog media do people even use nowadays?

479
00:33:04,991 --> 00:33:06,698
Rym: I mean, no one uses cassette tapes anymore.

480
00:33:06,758 --> 00:33:10,029
Scott: Really someone might use a vinyl record if they're a DJ.

481
00:33:11,231 --> 00:33:12,134
Scott: Vinyl record works.

482
00:33:12,454 --> 00:33:25,217
Scott: It's a big record with bumps on it and this needle goes in the groove and it bounces on the bumps and The bumps are all different sizes and shapes and different distances apart and when the needle bumps up and down Music comes out the other end.

483
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:25,800
Rym: Yeah.

484
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,587
Rym: Well, it also kind of bumps left and right.

485
00:33:27,728 --> 00:33:36,490
Rym: Yep We're not gonna go into detail but suffice to say actually the way Records work and the way they make them sound the way they do is very interesting.

486
00:33:36,993 --> 00:33:43,930
Rym: I mean you actually have to apply a crazy Crazy equalization filter to anything you put on a record.

487
00:33:44,412 --> 00:33:47,807
Rym: Otherwise anytime there was a bass beat it would throw the needle out of the grooves.

488
00:33:48,148 --> 00:33:53,950
Rym: Yep, and You high frequency stuff wouldn't even register because you couldn't make grooves that small.

489
00:33:54,392 --> 00:33:57,872
Scott: Yep, I mean if you take the needle the needle doesn't move around that much You know.

490
00:33:57,912 --> 00:34:01,829
Scott: if you just take it and like poke it with your finger all sorts of crazy noises come out.

491
00:34:02,592 --> 00:34:09,695
Scott: The record has to very subtly and accurately move the needle in the correct way with the correct amount of force to get the right Sounds to come out.

492
00:34:09,976 --> 00:34:10,178
Rym: Yep.

493
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:12,150
Rym: Now cassette tapes are very simple.

494
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:16,202
Rym: You just take a magnetic field and you impart that magnet.

495
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:18,670
Rym: I mean you you make the magnetic field manipulate the tape.

496
00:34:18,831 --> 00:34:26,379
Scott: Yeah, basically if you take a plastic tape and you put like iron Ferro whatnot, you know magnetic cruft in it.

497
00:34:26,438 --> 00:34:28,005
Scott: Yeah, you put it on both sides.

498
00:34:28,045 --> 00:34:29,489
Scott: Just like it's magnetic paint.

499
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,521
Scott: Basically, it's just iron paint and you put it on both sides.

500
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:35,070
Scott: Well, that would it's not really iron paint.

501
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,580
Rym: Well, no, it's not really both side.

502
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:41,109
Scott: I mean when you talk about the two sides Oh, yeah, if it's a cassette tape, it's it's one side.

503
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:46,090
Rym: Basically, I mean cassette tapes have two sides, but it's really the left side and the right side.

504
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,262
Scott: Yeah at the top of the bottom.

505
00:34:47,282 --> 00:34:47,989
Scott: That's a cassette tape.

506
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:51,370
Scott: But anyway other things that use the same mechanism do use both sides.

507
00:34:51,491 --> 00:35:00,750
Scott: but now you have this tape and You have basically this magnetic head that can magnetize and demagnetize the tape in different positions.

508
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:05,310
Scott: So, you know, let's say you have a spot on the tape you magnetize it.

509
00:35:05,611 --> 00:35:09,550
Scott: It stays magnetized unless of course another magnet comes along and screws it up.

510
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:12,520
Scott: So it's basically when you want to read the tape.

511
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,630
Scott: it goes down the tape and it's magnetized not magnetized.

512
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:19,510
Rym: It's kind of like the magnetic equivalent of the grooves on a record.

513
00:35:19,892 --> 00:35:23,669
Rym: You're making a magnetic field that changes in relation to the audio out there.

514
00:35:24,392 --> 00:35:28,430
Rym: That magnetic field is being created in space and there's a tape moving through that space.

515
00:35:28,951 --> 00:35:34,410
Rym: So the magnetic field that's moving in space changes the magnetic properties of the tape as it goes by.

516
00:35:34,992 --> 00:35:38,670
Rym: Then you can use a device that will read those magnetic fluctuations back from the tape.

517
00:35:39,111 --> 00:35:48,629
Scott: So instead of physical bumps moving a needle up and down this magnetic field That's on the tape moves a magnet around and when that magnet moves music comes out.

518
00:35:49,031 --> 00:35:52,022
Rym: Essentially now, of course, it's a lot more complicated than that.

519
00:35:52,042 --> 00:36:18,549
Rym: You actually if you just tried to do that I mean way back people realize this would work a long time ago But they couldn't make anything intelligible come out because it turned out that if you just did that with a magnet Due to various things that we're not going to get into what you would get when you played it back was garbage and you had To do special things to the tape before you recorded audio to it And you had to make the audio look a certain way to make the stuff come back.

520
00:36:18,964 --> 00:36:21,170
Scott: Yeah That's why tapes weren't the best quality.

521
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:26,950
Scott: Yeah And you would go to the store and you get like these hi-fi tapes and they had DAT tapes and all sorts of crazy.

522
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:27,873
Rym: Well, DAT is digital.

523
00:36:27,954 --> 00:36:30,262
Scott: DAT is digital, but you know, totally different.

524
00:36:30,402 --> 00:36:31,205
Scott: It's still magnetic.

525
00:36:31,426 --> 00:36:31,667
Rym: It is.

526
00:36:31,847 --> 00:36:33,835
Rym: Yeah, and Just real quick.

527
00:36:34,257 --> 00:36:51,170
Rym: Yeah, a lot of people seem to think that cassette tapes and VCR, you know VHS tapes basically work the same way and all I'm going to tell you is that not really I mean on a fundamental level Yes, but if you have time go to like how stuff works and look at how a VCR a VHS VCR actually reads a tape.

528
00:36:51,634 --> 00:36:52,806
Rym: It's not the way you think.

529
00:36:53,008 --> 00:36:59,910
Scott: no I mean, it's the same kind of principle of you have a tape that's magnetized in different amounts on different spots on the tape.

530
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:03,322
Scott: Yep, but because there's it's a video with audio.

531
00:37:03,403 --> 00:37:04,446
Rym: That's a lot of data.

532
00:37:04,466 --> 00:37:05,430
Scott: That's a lot of data.

533
00:37:05,551 --> 00:37:08,790
Scott: How do you get so much data into such a small amount of tape?

534
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:13,830
Scott: I mean back in the day they'll use big reels of magnetic tape to put stuff on.

535
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:17,561
Scott: Yeah, they're using this little tiny VCR video cassette.

536
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:20,670
Scott: It's not an inch wide and it's holding a whole movie.

537
00:37:20,831 --> 00:37:23,321
Scott: I mean you and you download a movie from the internet.

538
00:37:23,381 --> 00:37:25,650
Scott: It's it might be might even be a gigabyte.

539
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,678
Scott: Who knows it's hundreds of megabytes at the least.

540
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:32,209
Rym: Yeah for like a half hour and think it's not even an inch wide And it doesn't move that fast.

541
00:37:32,471 --> 00:37:37,030
Rym: So, how do you get that much data out of a piece of poorly magnetic tape?

542
00:37:37,251 --> 00:37:43,250
Rym: That's moving relatively slowly because you have to get all the data for a given frame at the same time or it's useless.

543
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,901
Scott: Yeah, and it's so.

544
00:37:44,921 --> 00:37:48,720
Scott: I guess you could buffer it up But they didn't have the memory that buffer it up.

545
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,190
Scott: if they had that they wouldn't need visa VGS tapes.

546
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:58,130
Rym: The answer is essentially that they actually stored the data at a really wide like at an angle and it's kind of cool.

547
00:37:58,411 --> 00:38:00,426
Scott: It's pretty tricky the way they did that.

548
00:38:00,668 --> 00:38:18,183
Rym: Yeah I mean while old technology seems old and archaic the Limitations people had to work with even as recently as the 90s with a lot of this stuff forced a lot of really innovative solutions and I'd say that a lot of old technology at least from The non this perspective here is a lot more interesting than modern technology.

549
00:38:18,203 --> 00:38:21,275
Scott: It is more interesting because nowadays it's like, okay We have a hard drive.

550
00:38:21,596 --> 00:38:22,862
Scott: Well, what can we do?

551
00:38:22,882 --> 00:38:24,590
Scott: I know let's make the hard drive bigger.

552
00:38:24,771 --> 00:38:27,422
Scott: Oh, look, we found a way to make it bigger instead of huh?

553
00:38:27,463 --> 00:38:29,110
Scott: We haven't found a way to make it bigger.

554
00:38:29,371 --> 00:38:32,290
Scott: We're gonna have to pull some tricks in order to make it big.

555
00:38:33,155 --> 00:38:35,670
Scott: Get more out of what we've already got, you know.

556
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:41,942
Scott: And that's why hacks are always interesting because hacking is all about getting more From what you've already got as opposed to just getting more.

557
00:38:41,962 --> 00:38:51,890
Rym: Yep, because now especially the digital media You can almost always make up for any other deficiency with more processing power or more data manipulation or buffering or something like that.

558
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,976
Rym: Those weren't options back in the day.

559
00:38:54,017 --> 00:39:03,962
Scott: It's a lot more impressive when a guy takes, you know, like a piece of shit Chevy like Cavalier that was $5,000 and makes it 500 horsepower.

560
00:39:03,982 --> 00:39:06,450
Scott: then one a guy just gets a lot of money and buys a Ferrari.

561
00:39:07,691 --> 00:39:08,474
Rym: That's a good way to put it.

562
00:39:08,594 --> 00:39:16,233
Rym: Yeah, but enough analog because I don't want to get into things like FM radio, but Well, actually this is one more thing I want to say about tapes.

563
00:39:16,394 --> 00:39:18,721
Scott: is that tapes are not just used for audio.

564
00:39:19,042 --> 00:39:21,350
Scott: tapes are used for computers.

565
00:39:21,972 --> 00:39:22,354
Rym: Ah, yes.

566
00:39:22,414 --> 00:39:26,550
Rym: In fact, there was a thing for the Atari where you could record games to a audio cassette.

567
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:29,498
Scott: Well, I mean the Apple computers pretty much any computer.

568
00:39:29,538 --> 00:39:35,337
Scott: you had any personal computer, you know after the Altair when they actually made personal Computers they would have in your house.

569
00:39:35,759 --> 00:39:37,025
Scott: They didn't have cartridges.

570
00:39:37,066 --> 00:39:37,930
Scott: They didn't have floppy disks.

571
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:38,714
Scott: They had cassettes.

572
00:39:38,755 --> 00:40:04,075
Scott: you would take a cassette tape put it in a cassette deck it would basically play it and it would play into your computer and that would load software from the cassette tape into the computer and It basically worked, you know, if you ever used a modem a dial-up modem you hear it making all these noises like That's the sound of digital data being sent out Audio wise.

573
00:40:04,416 --> 00:40:08,789
Rym: well, it's digital data being sent in effectively an analog medium Yes.

574
00:40:09,493 --> 00:40:14,915
Scott: So if you just record let's say you put because I meet modems It is a little secret.

575
00:40:15,015 --> 00:40:22,002
Scott: if you ever noticed back in the day a lot of Packard Bell computers and other shitty computers the modem and the sound card would be the same thing.

576
00:40:22,544 --> 00:40:26,930
Scott: maybe because a modem is Basically a sound card with a phone hole on it.

577
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:38,069
Rym: Yep, even more there used to be some contest among, you know Super cool hacker types back when modems were really slow To try and whistle and warble and make noises to get a modem to respond to you.

578
00:40:38,531 --> 00:40:39,735
Scott: Yeah, I mean think about it.

579
00:40:39,935 --> 00:40:40,999
Scott: a telephone line.

580
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:41,781
Scott: What do you do?

581
00:40:41,821 --> 00:40:42,644
Scott: You talk on it?

582
00:40:42,965 --> 00:40:44,530
Scott: You send audio data over it.

583
00:40:44,912 --> 00:40:46,057
Scott: So what does the modem do?

584
00:40:46,138 --> 00:40:48,410
Scott: it converts digital computer data?

585
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:57,916
Scott: Into audio sends it over the phone line as if it was you talking and the computer on the other end listens to the talking And talks back.

586
00:40:58,056 --> 00:40:59,742
Rym: Yeah, I mean we're not talking 56k.

587
00:40:59,782 --> 00:41:01,007
Rym: That was a wholly different thing.

588
00:41:01,067 --> 00:41:03,759
Rym: back in the day Modems were just audio data.

589
00:41:03,799 --> 00:41:06,090
Rym: There was no digital component along the line.

590
00:41:06,371 --> 00:41:09,849
Rym: You were sending it over the exact same path that your voice went over Yep.

591
00:41:10,273 --> 00:41:16,891
Scott: So back in the way back in the day all you had was a cassette tape and you would play the cassette tape into the Computer.

592
00:41:17,172 --> 00:41:19,299
Scott: and it worked the same way as a modem.

593
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:22,630
Scott: does the computer listen to the cassette tape talk to it?

594
00:41:22,971 --> 00:41:33,300
Scott: And that was the data, you know, the cassette tape would basically go one zero one zero Yeah, all kinds of nasty noises.

595
00:41:34,841 --> 00:41:40,200
Scott: That was before we invented the floppy disk, you know to this day not gonna talk about punch cards.

596
00:41:40,601 --> 00:41:41,083
Rym: No, no.

597
00:41:41,243 --> 00:41:42,749
Rym: or or punch tape.

598
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,053
Rym: No or any of that.

599
00:41:44,254 --> 00:41:47,407
Scott: No, cuz it's not really that interesting It works like a scantron sheet.

600
00:41:47,427 --> 00:41:49,920
Rym: the end floppy disks are kind of interesting.

601
00:41:50,482 --> 00:41:51,708
Scott: floppy disks are very interesting.

602
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:58,495
Scott: they work with the same basic principle as You know tapes and big reel-to-reel tapes and cassette tapes.

603
00:41:58,555 --> 00:41:59,840
Scott: and you know, it's it's magnetic.

604
00:42:00,122 --> 00:42:04,266
Scott: There's a magnet that makes parts of the tape Magnetic and not magnetic.

605
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:08,500
Scott: However, a floppy disk doesn't go from reel to reel.

606
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,416
Scott: You don't have to read it from beginning to end you can.

607
00:42:11,516 --> 00:42:12,099
Scott: it's a disk.

608
00:42:12,581 --> 00:42:14,283
Scott: It's if you take the plastic off you.

609
00:42:14,804 --> 00:42:16,847
Scott: most people probably took the plastic of a floppy disk.

610
00:42:17,387 --> 00:42:34,314
Scott: It's a big magnetic disk and You can read either the part that's close to the middle or close to the edge and it spins around so you can go to any part of this disk that you want and Read any part of it you want and write any part of it you want.

611
00:42:34,334 --> 00:42:38,100
Scott: you don't have to move it very far I mean it takes this little tiny motor.

612
00:42:38,502 --> 00:42:46,580
Scott: it takes it less than a second to spin the whole thing around and You can move the reader and the writer back and forth, you know from one end to the other pretty quickly.

613
00:42:47,052 --> 00:43:00,936
Scott: so Instead of having to read something from beginning to end or write it from beginning to end and waiting for a whole tape to play You could just read and write any part of this disk you want with the same, you know magnet No magnet and that's what a floppy disk does.

614
00:43:01,399 --> 00:43:11,537
Rym: Yep Now the interesting thing is that floppy disks just especially all floppy disks really were actually kind of messy in terms of how they were Just because the technology wasn't quite there yet.

615
00:43:12,315 --> 00:43:29,440
Rym: Yeah As a result you could do clever things if you messed with your floppy drive Like you could change the angle of the head or whatever And write data to a floppy disk that couldn't be read by another standard floppy drive But could be read by any drive that you would equally modified.

616
00:43:30,529 --> 00:43:35,578
Rym: in fact A lot of people with older computers back then would have a problem where they could use their floppy disk.

617
00:43:35,618 --> 00:43:36,100
Rym: just fine.

618
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:41,432
Rym: But if they went to their friend's house No one could read their floppy disk because their floppy drive was messed up.

619
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:45,199
Rym: the head would drift over time due to I don't know Being a cheap floppy drive or whatever.

620
00:43:45,922 --> 00:43:51,725
Rym: And a lot of people just because they didn't know how how floppy drives worked had no idea What was going on.

621
00:43:51,826 --> 00:43:53,554
Rym: and imagine that you burn cds.

622
00:43:53,574 --> 00:43:54,780
Rym: they work fine in your computer.

623
00:43:55,141 --> 00:43:59,697
Rym: They don't work in anyone else's computer except maybe crazy joe's computer down the street in his basement.

624
00:43:59,978 --> 00:44:05,680
Scott: Yeah So you could always take your floppy drive to someone's house if you had a small kind if you're lucky.

625
00:44:06,001 --> 00:44:08,489
Scott: Yeah, anyway, I just want to shock people a little bit.

626
00:44:08,891 --> 00:44:10,697
Scott: The first floppy disk was the ibm 23 fd.

627
00:44:12,102 --> 00:44:13,290
Scott: It was eight inches.

628
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:16,083
Scott: It was introduced in 1969.

629
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:18,056
Scott: Can you guess how much data you could put on it?

630
00:44:18,257 --> 00:44:18,277
Rym: 4k?

631
00:44:18,277 --> 00:44:22,819
Rym: 81.66 kilobytes, it's not bad.

632
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:29,180
Scott: But compare that to today that doesn't even store a single microsoft word file.

633
00:44:29,581 --> 00:44:31,125
Scott: Now that's how small this is.

634
00:44:31,406 --> 00:44:33,813
Rym: I have text files bigger than that.

635
00:44:34,154 --> 00:44:36,040
Scott: I also have text files bigger than that.

636
00:44:36,401 --> 00:44:37,505
Scott: It's basically useless.

637
00:44:37,786 --> 00:44:40,696
Scott: and think about this even for most of the floppy disk days.

638
00:44:41,218 --> 00:44:44,813
Scott: We used 1.44 megabyte floppy disks.

639
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:48,689
Scott: that doesn't even hold An mp3 of any reasonable length.

640
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:49,954
Scott: It's so small.

641
00:44:50,014 --> 00:44:51,480
Scott: It barely holds two pictures.

642
00:44:52,383 --> 00:44:53,540
Scott: It's so ridiculous.

643
00:44:54,181 --> 00:44:57,549
Rym: Now aside from I mean moving on from that you've all used cds.

644
00:44:57,609 --> 00:45:06,080
Scott: cds have been the gold standard for a long time And cds are the first thing that we're going to talk about now.

645
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,980
Rym: We're not going to talk about red book, whatever or all the actual standards.

646
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:11,605
Rym: Who developed it?

647
00:45:11,645 --> 00:45:13,031
Rym: That's all stuff you don't care about.

648
00:45:13,433 --> 00:45:27,039
Rym: cds while they're really shiny And while they were absolutely amazing to most people when they came out are not quite as uh, I don't know Really cool or revolutionary or crazy as you might think if you really look at how they work.

649
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,691
Scott: Yeah, a cd is what's known as an optical disc now optical.

650
00:45:31,872 --> 00:45:32,554
Scott: What does that mean?

651
00:45:32,614 --> 00:45:35,040
Scott: that the eyeballs eyeballs optics opticians?

652
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,545
Scott: It's about seeing.

653
00:45:36,947 --> 00:45:38,937
Scott: it uses light not magnets.

654
00:45:39,318 --> 00:45:39,540
Scott: light.

655
00:45:40,061 --> 00:45:57,460
Scott: There's a laser in the cd drive and it points the laser at the cd and just like a floppy drive You know It moves the laser closer to the middle of the cd and close to the edge of the cd and it spins the cd around And the laser literally looks at the cd and it bounces off the cd.

656
00:45:58,003 --> 00:46:02,826
Scott: And in the cd if you get real close you can see There are these pits in the cd.

657
00:46:02,867 --> 00:46:03,007
Scott: Yep.

658
00:46:03,027 --> 00:46:07,727
Rym: There's basically a groove a spiral that goes all the way from the middle of this The outer the disc.

659
00:46:07,767 --> 00:46:13,713
Scott: it's one long spiral Just like on a record only where the record had all kinds of different bumps.

660
00:46:14,075 --> 00:46:16,944
Scott: the cd pretty much either has a bump Or not a bump.

661
00:46:17,145 --> 00:46:19,213
Scott: That's all it has is bump and not bump.

662
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:23,933
Scott: if the laser sees a bump I don't know if that's zero or one I forget but it's it.

663
00:46:24,013 --> 00:46:25,097
Scott: that's basically how it is.

664
00:46:25,379 --> 00:46:25,680
Rym: That's it.

665
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,564
Rym: You just look at the bumps.

666
00:46:26,685 --> 00:46:32,047
Rym: theoretically if you had a high enough resolution scanner You could scan a cd.

667
00:46:32,067 --> 00:46:33,190
Scott: There was a guy who did that.

668
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:36,640
Scott: He had a fancy scanner and put the cd on the scanner.

669
00:46:37,062 --> 00:46:43,928
Scott: He scanned the cd and then it made a file that was 640 megabytes on his hard drive.

670
00:46:43,948 --> 00:46:45,695
Scott: that was the same as what was on the cd.

671
00:46:46,277 --> 00:46:47,120
Scott: It was pretty crazy.

672
00:46:47,861 --> 00:46:54,267
Rym: Now the methods of making cds changed over the years and the cds used to be thicker And there's all sorts of stuff.

673
00:46:54,288 --> 00:46:58,429
Rym: but an interesting thing that a lot of people don't seem to realize Take a cd and look at it, right?

674
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:04,619
Rym: It's got the shiny side where all the data is And on the other side, there's usually a label or some kind of thing.

675
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,492
Rym: Now, where do you think the data is stored on your cd?

676
00:47:08,512 --> 00:47:10,180
Rym: Where do you think it actually sits?

677
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:17,140
Scott: Well, see at first I always thought that you know, obviously the very bottom is plastic and the top is paint.

678
00:47:17,522 --> 00:47:21,500
Scott: So the you know, the actual grooves and things must be some layer in the middle.

679
00:47:21,921 --> 00:47:24,592
Rym: Well in old old cds that was the case.

680
00:47:24,632 --> 00:47:26,540
Rym: there used to be plastic sheathing on both sides.

681
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,373
Scott: Oh, they used to put the cd in like a plastic kind of.

682
00:47:29,394 --> 00:47:30,740
Scott: uh, what was it called?

683
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,526
Rym: My uncle had one of those drives.

684
00:47:32,546 --> 00:47:37,048
Rym: we had to put the cd in basically a special cd cartridge and then put that in The cd drive.

685
00:47:37,089 --> 00:47:47,156
Scott: Yeah, because they you know They didn't want the cds wobbling all over the place and they didn't yet develop the technology where it was okay If the cd wasn't perfect, yeah, you know cds are like 40x 80x whatever.

686
00:47:47,637 --> 00:47:55,460
Rym: that is the Because originally cd run for all 1x meaning they read a cd at the rate of playing audio from a cd.

687
00:47:55,981 --> 00:48:00,315
Rym: That means if you wanted to read an entire cd, it took an hour.

688
00:48:00,736 --> 00:48:01,940
Scott: It was really slow.

689
00:48:02,081 --> 00:48:12,360
Scott: I mean you used to distribute these uh Encyclopedias on cd and it to open up any page on the encyclopedia was slower than opening up a page on wikipedia.

690
00:48:12,702 --> 00:48:23,537
Rym: I'm, so glad the internet obviated the need for uh, yeah But the data Effectively, I mean you're looking at your cd, right?

691
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,245
Rym: The data is just on the other side of that label and if you scratch some of the label off You're gonna ruin that cd.

692
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:29,708
Scott: Yep.

693
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:37,799
Rym: Meanwhile, if you scratch the shiny side All you have to do is buff the whole thing down evenly And the data is still there and it's fine and you can read it.

694
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:44,600
Scott: Yeah, of course buffing cds has always proved to be uh painful and usually doesn't work unless you do it really professionally.

695
00:48:45,062 --> 00:48:48,600
Scott: All those like doctor cd fixer things are a bunch of crap.

696
00:48:48,822 --> 00:48:50,980
Rym: I mean they can work in some situations.

697
00:48:51,181 --> 00:49:02,060
Scott: But well in general and the only time I tried to use one of those is my friend gave me a copy of final fantasy 7 for the pc and at one of the fmvs it see it was a scratch in the bottom of the cd.

698
00:49:02,685 --> 00:49:04,240
Scott: So there's no way to continue with the game.

699
00:49:04,621 --> 00:49:05,363
Scott: Because think about it.

700
00:49:05,684 --> 00:49:09,737
Scott: if there's a scratch in the cd the laser is looking at the cd.

701
00:49:09,757 --> 00:49:13,338
Scott: if there's a scratch It doesn't see the right thing and that's why it screws up.

702
00:49:13,439 --> 00:49:18,939
Rym: now You might be thinking I have a lot of cds and a lot of them are scratched to hell but yet they still play well one.

703
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,015
Rym: Holding cds is not a difficult skill.

704
00:49:22,055 --> 00:49:22,700
Rym: to this day.

705
00:49:22,981 --> 00:49:28,500
Rym: I cringe when I see people that handle dvds and cds and any kind of medium like this wrong.

706
00:49:28,983 --> 00:49:33,271
Rym: If you're gonna lay it on a table lay it with the label down So you're not scratching the good bit.

707
00:49:33,391 --> 00:49:34,499
Rym: the dust isn't gonna hurt it.

708
00:49:35,443 --> 00:49:42,127
Rym: If you're gonna pick it up put a finger in the hole put a finger on the edge and don't touch the shiny part Or drop it like I just did.

709
00:49:42,248 --> 00:49:49,160
Scott: Yeah, you should not touch the bottom of a cd because If there's smudges on it, it's really hard for the laser to see the dots.

710
00:49:49,602 --> 00:49:54,569
Rym: And if you have a dvd and you're watching it and you're done with it Don't just leave it laying on the floor.

711
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:56,739
Rym: good god put it back in this dvd case.

712
00:49:57,462 --> 00:49:58,083
Rym: I do that.

713
00:49:58,144 --> 00:49:59,568
Rym: I can't even as a kid.

714
00:49:59,608 --> 00:50:03,659
Rym: I remember that all my friends cds would be scratched to utter fucking hell.

715
00:50:04,522 --> 00:50:14,319
Rym: And my cds were I. I one cd ever got scratched and that's because the cd case broke and it bounced around in there for a day And I was mortified and I rebought the cd.

716
00:50:16,243 --> 00:50:19,560
Rym: Yeah, but anyway How come it still reads that data?

717
00:50:19,981 --> 00:50:23,152
Scott: Well, but yeah, because I mean sometimes it gets scratched and it's game over.

718
00:50:23,213 --> 00:50:25,902
Scott: but sometimes it gets scratched and it's like, oh It's still good.

719
00:50:26,163 --> 00:50:26,665
Scott: It's still good.

720
00:50:26,806 --> 00:50:32,919
Rym: Well cd was such a robust standard that they thought so far ahead they knew That you're probably going to scratch your cds.

721
00:50:33,561 --> 00:50:40,640
Rym: And normally any scratch anywhere on a me on something like this any single bit being wrong basically makes the whole thing useless.

722
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:44,993
Rym: Well, all the bits on the cd aren't used to hold your data.

723
00:50:45,314 --> 00:50:49,560
Rym: In fact a lot of the bits Are used purely as redundancy.

724
00:50:50,102 --> 00:50:58,473
Rym: There's a lot of redundancy built into cds so that if you scratch it The laser can get the data elsewhere or based on the data around it.

725
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:00,478
Rym: You can recreate the data that's missing.

726
00:51:00,859 --> 00:51:03,789
Rym: Yep Wasn't as much of an issue for audio cds.

727
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:06,660
Rym: because you don't you're basically recreating an analog sound.

728
00:51:07,282 --> 00:51:17,940
Rym: so if you play an audio cd and there's a scratch a good cd player will just skip it or Interpolate what it thinks the noise would have been in that microsecond and just kind of make a staticky noise.

729
00:51:18,863 --> 00:51:20,720
Rym: And with digital data, there's just all this redundancy.

730
00:51:21,621 --> 00:51:28,471
Rym: Now people trying to put drm on cds tried to put stuff in there instead and all that did was make cds that break The moment you look at them.

731
00:51:28,674 --> 00:51:33,200
Scott: Yeah Yeah, okay now dvds aren't basically the same as cds.

732
00:51:33,301 --> 00:51:35,898
Scott: It works with the same principle as a laser and it looks at the dvd.

733
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,483
Scott: Only it can.

734
00:51:37,544 --> 00:51:40,011
Scott: there's a lot more dots there because they're closer together.

735
00:51:40,051 --> 00:51:43,380
Scott: They're smaller the laser's better and there's multiple layers.

736
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:55,857
Scott: They use refraction and reflection so that you know, even though it's just the same amount of surface area on the bottom They can actually bounce the laser to look at things and go one layer up into the disc.

737
00:51:55,917 --> 00:51:57,020
Scott: and it's all sort of crazy.

738
00:51:57,802 --> 00:51:59,547
Rym: Early dvds were not multi-layer.

739
00:51:59,748 --> 00:52:00,209
Scott: No, they weren't.

740
00:52:00,249 --> 00:52:04,260
Rym: in fact early dvds couldn't hold some movies in their entirety.

741
00:52:04,501 --> 00:52:14,419
Scott: Yeah, I mean think about this, you know those little like holograms you'll get where you look at it one way And you see a guy with like a thumbs up and you look at it the right You angle it differently and you see a guy with the thumbs down.

742
00:52:15,024 --> 00:52:17,120
Scott: That's kind of how dvd layers work.

743
00:52:17,441 --> 00:52:19,610
Scott: The laser looks at it one way and it sees one thing.

744
00:52:19,691 --> 00:52:21,720
Scott: then it looks at it the other way and it sees another thing.

745
00:52:22,081 --> 00:52:27,020
Scott: So you're holding, you know twice as much stuff without making the dvd any bigger, you know laser discs.

746
00:52:27,381 --> 00:52:29,307
Scott: That was before they invented multiple layers.

747
00:52:29,327 --> 00:52:33,140
Scott: They just had a big giant disc that was basically the same as a cd.

748
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,183
Rym: Yeah, just bigger.

749
00:52:34,244 --> 00:52:38,800
Scott: It was just huge so that you could actually fit a whole movie on it, but it kind of sucked.

750
00:52:39,343 --> 00:52:45,506
Rym: Now, you know hd dvd blu-ray all these new things They're basically The same as a cd.

751
00:52:45,607 --> 00:52:49,420
Rym: just technology to do that exact thing has gotten better and better and better.

752
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,264
Rym: They use different lasers and different reflections The blu-ray uses.

753
00:52:52,384 --> 00:52:59,547
Scott: the blu-ray gets its name from a blue laser, which is much higher frequency more powerful more dangerous But more precise and it can.

754
00:52:59,768 --> 00:53:04,739
Scott: you can have the dots be a lot smaller and you can hold a lot more data And a lot less space just by looking at it.

755
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,045
Rym: But at the same time think of this.

756
00:53:06,326 --> 00:53:06,809
Rym: there's a lot.

757
00:53:06,849 --> 00:53:12,099
Rym: the data density is a lot more because it's still the same size as A cd but you've got so much more data on there.

758
00:53:12,561 --> 00:53:17,439
Rym: So an average scratch covers a lot more bits than it covers on a cd.

759
00:53:18,448 --> 00:53:18,839
Scott: It's true.

760
00:53:19,061 --> 00:53:26,386
Rym: Now I not enough people have had enough experience with blu-ray and hd dvd to know if this is going to be a serious issue Or I don't know.

761
00:53:26,446 --> 00:53:28,153
Scott: I mean if you scratch a cd, right?

762
00:53:28,193 --> 00:53:31,324
Scott: Let's say a cd has a bunch of uh, Mp3s on it, right?

763
00:53:31,585 --> 00:53:32,689
Scott: It's not a music cd.

764
00:53:32,749 --> 00:53:33,813
Scott: It's an mp3 cd.

765
00:53:34,475 --> 00:53:37,987
Scott: one scratch might kill One mp3, right?

766
00:53:38,108 --> 00:53:38,570
Scott: Maybe two.

767
00:53:39,073 --> 00:53:40,440
Scott: if it's a normal scratch, you know.

768
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,564
Scott: Say a fingernail scratch.

769
00:53:41,925 --> 00:53:45,859
Scott: if you have a blu-ray disc, let's say you fill the whole thing with mp3s.

770
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:53,685
Scott: now There's a lot more mp3s there and one scratch, you know, that's the same size might lose the same percentage but you're gonna.

771
00:53:53,766 --> 00:53:58,344
Scott: that percentage is you know, one percent of ten mp3s is Not so many.

772
00:53:58,726 --> 00:54:01,479
Scott: one percent of a billion mp3s is a lot more.

773
00:54:02,042 --> 00:54:04,740
Scott: One of the last things I want to tell you is how a cd burns.

774
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,949
Scott: I mean a cd from a factory.

775
00:54:07,089 --> 00:54:09,499
Scott: they do it with a special machine and they do it really well.

776
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:16,458
Rym: god I have a audio textbook from the 90s and it shows how they used to make cds talk about clean room scary.

777
00:54:16,499 --> 00:54:21,500
Scott: Good god Yeah, nowadays you burn cds the cdr now, how does that work?

778
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,574
Scott: I mean it's hard to put bumps in something when there's plastic in the way.

779
00:54:25,655 --> 00:54:29,270
Rym: Yeah contrary to popular belief You're not burning little pits into the cd.

780
00:54:29,491 --> 00:54:31,440
Scott: No, that would be too professional.

781
00:54:31,621 --> 00:54:36,413
Rym: But think of this, uh when you read a cd It basically the light comes back or the light doesn't come back.

782
00:54:36,593 --> 00:54:38,060
Scott: if there's a it comes back differently.

783
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:39,459
Rym: Yeah, if there's a pit or not a pit.

784
00:54:40,521 --> 00:54:48,339
Scott: So the reason the bottom of a cdr is blue Or red or black or green or whatever or whatever color they put at the bottom of the cdr.

785
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,467
Scott: But usually it's sort of this bluish purple.

786
00:54:50,849 --> 00:54:53,800
Scott: It's because there's ink in there and there's a different.

787
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,600
Scott: There's a better a different kind of laser.

788
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,505
Scott: It's not really different.

789
00:54:56,546 --> 00:55:02,138
Scott: but they use the laser in a different way and they you know They hold it there for longer and it points at the bottom of the cd.

790
00:55:02,541 --> 00:55:09,590
Scott: And when the laser hits this special ink in a special way It burns the ink and the ink changes color.

791
00:55:10,051 --> 00:55:19,860
Scott: so you can put dots in the bottom of a cdr By burning this ink thus writing data to a cd that can later be read by any other cd drive.

792
00:55:20,081 --> 00:55:24,097
Rym: So instead of reading pits and non-pits is reading dark spots and non-dark spots.

793
00:55:24,419 --> 00:55:29,680
Rym: Yep Now we could go on and we would accept that we've already gone for pretty long as the show.

794
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,920
Scott: Yeah, we didn't talk about flash.

795
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:36,984
Rym: You'll have to find that out on your own or all sorts of things or wait for another show like magneto optical Which is really kind of cool.

796
00:55:37,165 --> 00:55:41,580
Scott: Yeah, or we didn't even talk about hard drives, but hard drives are basically just better magnets.

797
00:55:42,102 --> 00:55:51,940
Rym: Yep, so I guess one is if some of our analogies weren't exactly perfect We really really tried to not be technical and to explain things in easy to understand terms.

798
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:52,828
Scott: Yes, so don't tell us.

799
00:55:53,091 --> 00:55:54,080
Scott: Oh, no, you got it wrong.

800
00:55:54,361 --> 00:56:01,608
Rym: Technically a cd would be a better metaphor of blah because we know we're perfectly aware We're trying to make this a little bit accessible.

801
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:06,046
Rym: Yes, and two if you thought that was cool Uh, let us know.

802
00:56:06,126 --> 00:56:18,528
Rym: we could either go into much more depth on any or all of those topics the ones we just talked about or we could do another show and talk about all the other things like flash and magneto optical and Cdrw, which is kind of cool actually.

803
00:56:18,629 --> 00:56:20,457
Scott: and uh that rosetta thing.

804
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:27,224
Scott: Yeah Yeah, but uh, yeah, if you want to find more information on your own you can go to howstuffworks.com Or wikipedia.

805
00:56:27,465 --> 00:56:30,978
Rym: Yes, actually howstuffworks.com is pretty fantastic.

806
00:56:31,038 --> 00:56:36,496
Scott: I must say At howstuffworks.com you can find out basically how any part of your computer works or your car.

807
00:56:36,756 --> 00:56:40,997
Rym: I remember way back I look I didn't actually know how an automatic transmission worked.

808
00:56:41,258 --> 00:56:48,220
Rym: So I I watched an animation on how stuff works and I was like, oh that's kind of cool planetary gears for the win.

809
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,250
Scott: All right I think the show's over.

810
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:51,037
Rym: I think it is.

811
00:56:58,261 --> 00:57:00,851
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

812
00:57:00,891 --> 00:57:03,020
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music.

813

814
00:57:15,487 --> 00:57:21,140
Rym: we say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

815
00:57:21,682 --> 00:57:23,852
Rym: Mondays are science and technology tuesdays.

816
00:57:23,892 --> 00:57:25,720
Rym: We have video games board games and rpgs.

817
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:31,780
Rym: Wednesdays are anime manga comic nights and thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

818
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:40,299
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com Or you can send audio feedback via odeo.

819
00:57:40,661 --> 00:57:43,880
Scott: Just click the link that says send me an odeo on the right side of our website.

820
00:57:44,241 --> 00:57:45,145
Rym: If you like what you hear.

821

825
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:12,075
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience, but unlike those other late shows.

826
00:58:12,376 --> 00:58:13,700
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.
