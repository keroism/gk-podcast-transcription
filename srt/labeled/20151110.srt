1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:15,385
Rym: So, of all the weird recruiter messages I get in email and LinkedIn, how come none of them are ever like, "Hey, you want to work at a game

2
00:00:15,426 --> 00:00:15,809
Rym: studio?"?

3
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,103
Rym: It's always like, "Hey, do you want a terrible

4
00:00:18,163 --> 00:00:18,545
Rym: job?".

5
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:28,970
Scott: How come it's at least never like, "Hey, I realize that looking at your profile here that the job I'm offering is not better than what you have, so I'm not going to bother

6
00:00:29,471 --> 00:00:29,556
Scott: you.".

7
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,317
Scott: And then when you do get an email, it's like, "Oh, I actually have a better job than what you have

8
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:33,663
Scott: there.".

9
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:34,490
Rym: Yeah.

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:45,430
Scott: I mean, only one recruiter that's bothered me- If you check someone's LinkedIn profile and it says like, "Oh, yes, they've been working at Disney World for five years.

11
00:00:45,551 --> 00:00:48,708
Scott: They're in charge of taste-testing funnel

12
00:00:48,728 --> 00:00:49,050
Scott: cakes.".

13
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,270
Rym: Let's see if they want to be a janitor.

14
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:50,680
Scott: Yeah.

15
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:56,620
Scott: It's like, you can't come to them and be like, "Hey, I got this great opportunity for you at

16
00:00:56,782 --> 00:00:57,529
Scott: Quasi-Pac."

17
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,510
Scott: Pastoral tech.

18
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:02,050
Scott: In Connecticut, you know, taste-testing soda.

19
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,825
Scott: It's like, "That's not as good as funnel cake or Disney

20
00:01:04,866 --> 00:01:04,965
Scott: World.".

21
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:15,129
Rym: But, I got probably my favorite one ever recently, it was in LinkedIn and it was literally just- If anyone goes to me in LinkedIn, I just click ignore so they don't even get to me.

22
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:33,965
Rym: So this one was weird because it gave a salary off the bat and basically was a tantamount to an offer, but I'm going to quote, "Help, Brandon ampersand Q-U-O-T semi-colon Rym ampersand Q-U-O-T semi-colon

23
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:34,488
Rym: comma.".

24
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:35,669
Scott: Spam message.

25
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,329
Rym: Hope all is well.

26
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,770
Scott: It's obviously a spam, not an actual person.

27
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,810
Scott: Most of the time, it's an actual person, just a dumb one or a desperate one.

28
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:50,169
Rym: But to their credit, the job they offered me was actually something that I technically am capable of doing.

29
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:59,429
Rym: It was fixed production support specialist, which I have done and I know how to do, so their bot must have- And not many people on earth can do.

30
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,770
Rym: Yeah, which is scary and surprising because it's real easy.

31
00:02:05,174 --> 00:02:06,209
Rym: Like real easy.

32
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:15,348
Scott: So if they'll pay $145K for that- I know a lot of people who could use $145K, who are smart enough and capable of learning that.

33
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,310
Rym: I know you want to make video games, but you're not gonna.

34
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:25,549
Scott: So instead, learn this- And even if you're gonna, you're not going to be John Carmack successful at it.

35
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,209
Scott: It's just, I mean, it's possible, but it's so unlikely.

36
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:39,929
Scott: Just learn this tag equals value nonsense and get a job doing fix whatever and you'll make money and then- And then you can make video games when you're not at this boring desk that you're sitting at for eight hours a day.

37
00:02:41,753 --> 00:02:48,629
Scott: And with $140K, if you live the way you're living now with your low income, you'll save up enough, you can just like quit and not work for some time.

38
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:57,769
Rym: I mean, seriously, I learned that protocol in about a week and after a few years, I probably am one of the world's leading experts on that stupid thing.

39
00:02:58,115 --> 00:02:58,788
Scott: Well, who invented it?

40
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,470
Rym: A consortium for the industry so that it would be neutral.

41
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,785
Scott: But I mean, there's no person who's like primarily responsible.

42
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:06,630
Scott: that you could, you know.

43
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,110
Rym: There are people like that, however- Who are actually on the consortium?

44
00:03:10,694 --> 00:03:11,910
Rym: Well, I am a member.

45
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,350
Rym: I'm on some of the working groups, actually.

46
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,970
Scott: But I mean, who was on the original consortium?

47
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,690
Rym: So the original protocol is garbage.

48
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,010
Scott: If you quit your job, do you lose your position on the consortium?

49
00:03:22,251 --> 00:03:34,708
Rym: Yeah, actually, because you have to work for a company that's sponsoring it to pay for it, which is fine because me being on ... Years ago, me being like in that group meant, "Oh, I'm going to try really hard to make this protocol

50
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:34,950
Rym: better.".

51
00:03:35,272 --> 00:03:38,710
Rym: Now, it's just a bunch of conference calls that I dial into and then immediately mute.

52
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:40,527
Scott: Right?

53
00:03:40,891 --> 00:03:42,530
Scott: Someone's on those conference calls talking.

54
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:54,127
Rym: Yeah, and it's always either someone whose job at their company is to push the protocol in a direction for selfish needs or people who are trying to get a job somewhere else and are trying to grandstand and show off.

55
00:03:55,912 --> 00:04:00,930
Rym: So after I explained to people for like the 18th time what Bitcoin and blockchain actually do, I just stopped bothering.

56
00:04:02,195 --> 00:04:03,069
Rym: But that's not gaming.

57
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,690
Rym: That's not anything related to Tuesday.

58
00:04:06,072 --> 00:04:06,769
Rym: That's just things going on.

59
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:07,828
Scott: It could be related to gaming.

60
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:08,542
Rym: It could be.

61
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,870
Rym: Pick a game in the fixed protocol.

62
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,170
Rym: Use the fixed protocol as your middleware in the game.

63
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,170
Scott: All right, it's called Stock Exchange.

64
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,227
Scott: Here's how it works.

65
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:23,208
Rym: Actually, if someone made a game or a simulator or something that would ... You know all those programming games?

66
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,454
Rym: Make a game like that.

67
00:04:25,494 --> 00:04:30,731
Rym: that's like, "You're trying to pull the Superman 3.

68
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:32,449
Rym: Here's a bunch of stock exchanges.

69
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:37,508
Rym: You're a broker," or whatever, and you just start spoofing and hacking the fixed protocol and all that nonsense.

70
00:04:38,131 --> 00:04:39,609
Rym: That could be a moderately fun game.

71
00:04:40,431 --> 00:04:42,070
Rym: Anyway, got any news?

72
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:42,826
Rym: Gaming news?

73
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:50,261
Scott: There's a lot of little gaming news because this weekend that just passed, November, whatever it was, was the most gaming weekend.

74
00:04:50,281 --> 00:04:52,270
Scott: that wasn't a PAX all year.

75
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:57,726
Rym: I really wanted to go to a portion of that, but south of Staten Island is kind of far away.

76
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,930
Scott: Let's talk about all the things that happened this weekend.

77
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:14,650
Scott: Number one, smallest possible thing, the 20-sided store in Brooklyn, New York, which has been like sort of renovating and not having events for like a couple months, had a Netrunner tournament again that I didn't go to, but we're back in business in Brooklyn, baby.

78
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:18,790
Scott: All right, number two thing that happened on this epic gaming weekend.

79
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:24,110
Scott: Also Netrunner-related, the Fantasy Flight Games World Championships were this weekend.

80
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,389
Scott: Don't go to Minnesota just to play games, kids.

81
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,370
Rym: That's a bad idea, but do- We went to San Antonio just to play games.

82
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,009
Scott: Just by me specifically to play one game, right?

83
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:39,289
Scott: But do sit at home and watch on Twitch as the same guy wins again with a deck.

84
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:42,530
Scott: that is a cancer upon all of Netrunner, but it happened.

85
00:05:42,753 --> 00:05:43,789
Rym: Why don't you just play that deck?

86
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,410
Scott: If you want to win, sure, go ahead, but it really fucking sucks.

87
00:05:48,012 --> 00:05:48,908
Scott: It's boring as hell.

88
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:55,479
Rym: Dude, there was the era in Magic when you would just play like a red burn deck and it would beat 95% of people.

89
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,468
Scott: This is worse than that.

90
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,730
Scott: Anyway, it's not Netrunner.

91
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:08,208
Scott: So yeah, this also included, so the guy who won the X-Wing Championship won it for the third year in a row.

92
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:22,709
Scott: The guy who won Netrunner won it for the second year in a row, but there were plenty of awesome games of Netrunner and other Fantasy Flight Games to be seen, and also plenty of news and updates from the championship, so exciting things there.

93
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:29,006
Scott: The BlizzCon was this weekend, which had the Hearthstone World Championships, among other things.

94
00:06:30,090 --> 00:07:00,028
Scott: Totally, a guy won who never won before, and there were some epic games of Hearthstone to be seen, and what was interesting there was almost the opposite of the Netrunner situation, where in Hearthstone, the number one deck people are complaining about is this secret paladin who I really like, because paladins sucked for a long time, and I like paladins the most thematically, and I like secrets thematically, so the fact that secret paladin is like the best is the awesomest, but the guy who won the World Championship didn't use no secret paladin, so it shows what all the people complaining about secret paladin know.

95
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,710
Scott: They don't know shit.

96
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:09,443
Scott: Secret paladin not that good, but I like to be a secret paladin, so also the games that happened here in the finals, they're pretty amazing games.

97
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:18,990
Scott: if you like to watch some Hearthstone, and the final gaming news from this past weekend, it was the Extra Life gaming marathon weekend.

98
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:24,748
Scott: Extra Life is like a charity where you play game marathons and you raise money for the children or whatever.

99
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,829
Rym: Multiple of our friends ran events for this.

100
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,390
Rym: We did not, nor did we go to any, because we sucked.

101
00:07:30,811 --> 00:07:42,030
Scott: I think there were the most number of gaming marathon charity drive stream things this weekend for all the people who weren't watching BlizzCon, who weren't watching Fantasy Play Championships.

102
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:47,250
Scott: There were a zillion different charity streams to watch of people marathoning this and that.

103
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:50,529
Rym: I was sitting in my house editing tabletop videos.

104
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,388
Scott: I was sitting in my house watching these streams.

105
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:55,810
Scott: I didn't even watch football.

106
00:07:56,372 --> 00:07:57,470
Scott: It was also a football weekend.

107
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:05,290
Rym: I did learn, finally, how to color correct to make my old shitty camcorder kind of match the colors of your actual camera.

108
00:08:05,996 --> 00:08:06,929
Rym: I learned how to do that.

109
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:07,529
Rym: That's what I did.

110
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,489
Rym: That's the game I played.

111
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,690
Scott: Couldn't you just take a screenshot and drag it over, tell it to speed grade, whatever.

112
00:08:14,552 --> 00:08:17,230
Scott: Anyway, so yeah, mad gaming things happened this past weekend.

113
00:08:17,652 --> 00:08:21,626
Scott: If you missed any or all of them, they're all on the internets for you to check out post-hoc.

114
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:28,590
Rym: So Fallout 4 is being rated 9 to 9.5 out of 10.

115
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,710
Scott: I mean, that was a guarantee, right?

116
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,190
Scott: I mean, it really couldn't have been rated anything less than nine.

117
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:32,482
Rym: Yep.

118
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:41,809
Rym: The level of buzz and excitement seems to be equal to when Fallout 3 came out, despite the fact that this is the second time a Fallout reimagining has occurred.

119
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,970
Rym: So I'm going to play it when it actually gets released.

120
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,159
Rym: Game of the Year edition, 2016 Steam sale.

121
00:08:50,392 --> 00:08:52,971
Scott: Holiday sale, 2016.

122
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:53,829
Scott: Fallout 4 is going to happen.

123
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,670
Rym: Listen, I know it's a good game.

124
00:08:55,851 --> 00:08:56,490
Rym: Fallout 3 was a good game.

125
00:08:56,531 --> 00:08:57,410
Scott: I played Fallout 3.

126
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,610
Scott: I had a good time playing Fallout 3 and then never played it again.

127
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,889
Scott: I want to play Fallout 4, but I didn't.

128
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:02,909
Rym: But here's my problem.

129
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,650
Rym: I played Fallout 3 and then they added a bunch of stuff to make it way better.

130
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,150
Scott: That was a mistake that was made.

131
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,750
Rym: And it was good enough to play.

132
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,329
Scott: I actually don't remember if I bought it or if someone gifted it to me.

133
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,688
Scott: If you gifted it to me, thanks.

134
00:09:15,316 --> 00:09:18,090
Scott: But yeah, I should have waited for the $10 Game of the Year edition.

135
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:27,169
Rym: If they make a game like that better, the game itself is really good, but it's not good enough to play more than once all the way through.

136
00:09:27,332 --> 00:09:28,108
Scott: And it's a single player game.

137
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,908
Scott: Also, I remember I played New Vegas and I couldn't finish it because I guess it wasn't as good.

138
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,848
Scott: Maybe I should go back to that.

139
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:34,568
Rym: Oh yeah.

140
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,450
Scott: While I'm waiting for the next year, I'll just play New Vegas.

141
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:49,529
Rym: But I remember way back I saw someone took just Fallout 3, the Game of the Year fully decked out like Super Max edition compared to what the original game was at release and showed a few areas just side by side.

142
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,969
Rym: They're like completely different games sometimes.

143
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:56,170
Scott: Because they didn't finish the game, they just released it when they had to in time for the holiday season, right?

144
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,188
Scott: Black Friday is real soon.

145
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:01,610
Scott: People are buying PS4s and things and getting Fallout 4 for free with them, right?

146
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:04,170
Scott: So it's helping everybody in the money department.

147
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:11,130
Rym: Now I'm not going to lie, if Fallout 4 were just installed on Steam right now and I hadn't actually bought it- I would be playing it right now.

148
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,590
Rym: I'd probably double click on it as soon as I finish the show tonight.

149
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,350
Scott: Sure, probably.

150
00:10:14,711 --> 00:10:16,710
Scott: But- I'm going to click on Rocket League instead though.

151
00:10:16,832 --> 00:10:17,910
Rym: I'm not eating that marshmallow.

152
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,787
Rym: I'm going to wait.

153
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,510
Rym: This is going to be the Game of the Year edition.

154
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,690
Rym: But I noticed something weird.

155
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,349
Rym: A lot of people have also noticed this.

156
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:28,510
Rym: So the reviews all have numbers because that's just the stupid thing that people do.

157
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,130
Rym: So 9 out of 10, 9.5 out of 10.

158
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:37,930
Scott: But all the reviews attached to those numbers- Does he mean the words that no one reads?

159
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:45,750
Rym: The words actually talk a lot about kind of empty, not that much to do, gets boring after a few hours.

160
00:10:46,071 --> 00:10:46,726
Rym: But glitchy.

161
00:10:48,071 --> 00:10:52,390
Scott: I read about a guy who got stuck in elevators and he was so sad he had to load a really old save.

162
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,169
Rym: That's actually an article I've got up here in a tab right now.

163
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:07,350
Rym: But there is an update, supposedly that person had not updated, they had a pre-release copy that was buggy and they hadn't downloaded the latest PS4 system update.

164
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,716
Rym: That update, that news, 5.13 PM, so not long ago.

165
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,129
Scott: Okay.

166
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,610
Scott: So yeah, this is people, it's like dudes, update your shit.

167
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:23,330
Scott: I always say this a lot, but no matter what you've got going on, people are always hesitant to install updates.

168
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,510
Scott: Your Creative Cloud, update everything.

169
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:29,548
Rym: There are situations, I will give you, yes there are situations.

170
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:35,473
Rym: For example, my laptop, old Lenovo, like an X230, it's on Windows 7.

171
00:11:35,473 --> 00:11:37,810
Rym: I have the icon to upgrade it to Windows 10.

172
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:46,609
Rym: I was, when I got that notification of you can upgrade, two days later about to fly on a three week business trip where I needed to use my laptop a whole bunch.

173
00:11:47,452 --> 00:11:50,110
Rym: So I did not click install until I got back from that trip.

174
00:11:50,191 --> 00:11:51,129
Scott: Sure, that makes sense.

175
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:51,359
Scott: Yeah.

176
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,510
Scott: Because it would have erased everything.

177
00:11:52,991 --> 00:11:55,010
Rym: So yes, there are situations.

178
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:59,649
Scott: But I mean, don't, you know, unless, that's a reason in your life, that's not a technological reason.

179
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,709
Scott: Technologically, update fucking everything all the time.

180
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,450
Scott: Unless you know for a fact something specific is like evil out there.

181
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,170
Rym: Yeah, or like you're responsible for a hundred computers.

182
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,950
Rym: Update one of them, make sure it works and then update the rest of them.

183
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,910
Rym: But the edge cases, it's like the people who say I'm not fat, my high BMI is because I lift weights.

184
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:17,350
Rym: Well, yeah.

185
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,870
Scott: And this way you can avoid problems.

186
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,650
Scott: You know, you think, oh, it'll be such a problem.

187
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,670
Scott: I update my Photoshop.

188
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:22,890
Scott: They might move a button on you.

189
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:23,730
Scott: Yeah, that's not a big deal.

190
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:24,470
Scott: You know what's a big deal?

191
00:12:24,851 --> 00:12:30,190
Scott: Writing an article that makes you look like a dumb ass because your elevators didn't work when everyone else already had the patch.

192
00:12:30,893 --> 00:12:31,690
Scott: That's a problem.

193
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,089
Scott: That's a much bigger problem.

194
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,030
Rym: Like Creative Cloud, like look at the change log of Premiere.

195
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,483
Rym: A lot of those bugs are, yeah, your project's just fucked now.

196
00:12:39,844 --> 00:12:42,088
Rym: or yeah, that just won't render because reasons.

197
00:12:43,932 --> 00:12:47,510
Rym: So I saw a dude, because I was looking for, I was having a problem the other day.

198
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:57,490
Rym: That's where I tweeted my haiku from Adobe Premiere because when a render fails, it's supposed to give you like a log and an error, like it could have file somewhere.

199
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:57,907
Rym: No.

200
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:06,609
Rym: You know what that file says most of the time when it fails, unknown error and nothing, no information, no way to get more out of it.

201
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:10,990
Rym: So I was Googling like, is anyone having this problem right now with this particular thing?

202
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,330
Scott: The Adobe forums are actually surprisingly good.

203
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,650
Rym: Yeah, but I found a dude who was like, I'm having this problem.

204
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,810
Rym: It was the same kind of problem, but he had a screenshot.

205
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,530
Rym: I'm like, Ooh, cause he was doing a similar thing to what I was doing.

206
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,590
Rym: I click on his screenshot.

207
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:32,410
Rym: He is clearly running like a CS4 premiere and I'm like, dude, it's 2015.

208
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,065
Rym: Just let it go.

209
00:13:35,331 --> 00:13:40,466
Rym: But, uh, I just, I, the comment I make is the numbers on game.

210
00:13:40,506 --> 00:13:46,610
Rym: reviews seem to be driven by expectations and the words of the part that actually matter.

211
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:51,207
Scott: I just don't read or look at any reviews at all because I already know what this game's going to be.

212
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,429
Scott: I don't need a review to tell me what fallout four is going to be.

213
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:59,670
Scott: And that is fallout three with better graphics and all new maps and all new bad guys and all new stories and characters.

214
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,150
Scott: But otherwise the same game, mechanically speaking.

215
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:07,746
Rym: Well, when I, when I trust for review, I pretty much just trust the word of mouth of a handful of people.

216
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,650
Scott: All I need are two words, fallout and then the number four, I see actually only one word and one number.

217
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,989
Scott: That tells me everything I need to know.

218
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:14,345
Scott: Why do you?

219
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:15,269
Rym: Maybe not.

220
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,729
Rym: What if the game was transcended somehow?

221
00:14:16,911 --> 00:14:20,429
Scott: Like they just went way overboard and find out when I played it.

222
00:14:21,031 --> 00:14:25,969
Rym: Oh, you're not going to find out because someone tweeted like, Hey guys, I'm sure I would hear just through the buzz.

223
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,066
Scott: I don't need to read a review.

224
00:14:27,891 --> 00:14:31,550
Scott: It's like I'd hear a rumbling like what follow up for is nothing like fallout three.

225
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,790
Scott: It's a completely new kind of game.

226
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:33,294
Rym: Whoa.

227
00:14:33,994 --> 00:14:34,061
Rym: Yup.

228
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:34,709
Rym: But that's it.

229
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,390
Rym: I hear a rumble.

230
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,409
Scott: That would have been a news.

231
00:14:36,852 --> 00:14:37,950
Scott: I don't see any rumblings.

232
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:41,604
Scott: Therefore, all I heard is for her because I

233
00:14:41,624 --> 00:14:47,635
Rym: guess my perspective is few skewed just from getting like press releases and sort of like following the meta ahead of things instead of like, also

234
00:14:47,675 --> 00:14:51,318
Scott: I saw their cute videos, which I talked about all the different stats and those were

235
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:52,129
Rym: really good videos.

236
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,289
Scott: Those videos also taught me everything needs to know.

237
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,009
Rym: Those videos were on par with the team fortress two video.

238
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:01,368
Rym: I think they were better if you did you watch all the team because they made more team fortress two videos.

239
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,030
Scott: But these ones are more timeless.

240
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:04,868
Rym: Uh, no, I don't know.

241
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:12,290
Rym: I can watch those heavy videos over and over and you're not bad, but you know, anyway, the only other thing is there's a game out.

242
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:18,210
Rym: I've not played it yet, but I will tell you now that it's one of those like short games that's going to be big.

243
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:25,629
Rym: So if you need a game to do a panel about at a con, the game that you're going to want to do is called undertale.

244
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:30,710
Scott: Everyone keeps rumbling about this, but isn't it just like a JRPG with like a fortune styling?

245
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:32,237
Rym: Well, it's interesting.

246
00:15:32,257 --> 00:15:37,657
Rym: you say fortune styling because I wouldn't say that it's like a, so imagine an homage to earthbound.

247
00:15:38,158 --> 00:15:42,250
Rym: that's short and to the point without any repetitiveness.

248
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,610
Scott: So it takes how many minutes?

249
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,828
Rym: Like it's like a six hour game.

250
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:56,503
Rym: That's short enough ish, but it's got RPG style combat except that combat actually ends up being platforming or shmuping or bullet hell.

251
00:15:57,285 --> 00:15:58,168
Scott: and it's got bullet hell.

252
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,289
Scott: What's the difference?

253
00:15:59,611 --> 00:16:03,530
Rym: Uh, well sometimes you're platforming around obstacles with gravity.

254
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,550
Rym: Sometimes you're flying a heart around avoiding bullet hell.

255
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,290
Rym: Sometimes you're flying a heart around shooting at things, that kind of stuff.

256
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:17,281
Rym: It's got a great soundtrack and it's got a lot of those, you know, an RPGs have all those like dialogue choices and things that don't mean anything.

257
00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:22,130
Rym: from what I can gather in this game, everything means something.

258
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:26,530
Rym: So every choice you make will have some effect on the game later.

259
00:16:27,091 --> 00:16:28,229
Rym: So there's nothing but checkoffs.

260
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,429
Scott: It could be just a small effect.

261
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:41,150
Rym: Yeah, but it's little things like there's a spider girl who attacks you, but way early in the game there's an item that's like you go to this bake shop and for 9999 gold, you can buy a spider like pastry.

262
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,010
Rym: If you buy one, she's like, Oh, I guess you bought one of my pastries.

263
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:44,206
Rym: Cool.

264
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,469
Rym: I guess you're cool with spiders.

265
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:47,267
Rym: Stuff like that.

266
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:48,127
Scott: Okay.

267
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:55,598
Rym: It's also got like real plot stuff, but, uh, if you want to play that game, I'd suggest playing it now.

268
00:16:55,738 --> 00:17:00,429
Rym: ish because it's going to be like five nights at Freddy's and the internet's going to increasingly go apeshit over this thing.

269
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:03,890
Scott: I'm thinking the internet's already gone apeshit, I've seen this referred to all over the place.

270
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:04,813
Rym: So if you're

271
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,142
Scott: the kind of person who made this thing,

272
00:17:06,384 --> 00:17:20,950
Rym: if you're the cat, well, I'm going to wait and do a full review of it, but I'm going to play it cause I'm kind of into this, but if you're the kind of person who is afraid of spoilers and that game looks at all like ups up your alley, just play it now because it's going to get spoiled.

273
00:17:21,372 --> 00:17:25,369
Scott: How can you spoil something with so many possible endings with so many dialogue choices?

274
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:33,470
Rym: Well, cause there's some tropes and some themes and secret endings and also delightful things that happen in certain situations.

275
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,850
Rym: One of them was spoiled for me involving an inventory item called annoying dog.

276
00:17:37,413 --> 00:17:38,769
Scott: That's a Rym thing for sure.

277
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,650
Scott: Like dog and Rym likes annoying.

278
00:17:41,111 --> 00:17:42,469
Rym: So Scott, I'm going to spoil this for you now.

279
00:17:42,551 --> 00:17:43,389
Rym: See what happens guys.

280
00:17:43,751 --> 00:17:48,150
Rym: So you come to this room, there's this artifact, like a fancy artifact with a secret.

281
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:48,770
Rym: You're like, yes.

282
00:17:49,232 --> 00:17:53,369
Rym: If you try to pick up the artifact, it's like, can't pick up artifact, have too many dogs and inventory.

283
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,050
Rym: And so you go to your inventory and of course you do have that annoying dog.

284
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:06,430
Rym: So if you drop the annoying dog to get rid of it, then the dog is just on the screen with you and it runs over to the artifact, merges with the artifact and just runs away.

285
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:06,825
Rym: The end.

286
00:18:08,532 --> 00:18:10,187
Rym: And it plays a really great song while it does it.

287
00:18:11,872 --> 00:18:12,649
Scott: Go in a different room.

288
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,389
Scott: Drop the dog.

289
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:14,309
Rym: Yeah.

290
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:14,730
Rym: I don't know.

291
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,029
Rym: I haven't played the game, but I'm gonna.

292
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,150
Rym: Things of the day.

293
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:28,010
Rym: So I got a tiny thing of the day, but it's not enough.

294
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,188
Rym: So I got a real thing of the day too.

295
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:39,084
Rym: The tiny thing is someone noticed, this is a thing on Kotaku that, you know, Call of Duty games are pretty scripted and there's not that much FPS and going on most of the time.

296
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:49,808
Rym: So they noticed that in a particular long mission where you're like in a, like you're the guy man in the turret while the game is driving the car, he just sits there looking around.

297
00:18:50,612 --> 00:18:52,310
Rym: Just enjoying life, looking around.

298
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:57,909
Rym: And it turns out that that particular scenario, literally nothing you do has any impact on the game.

299
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,308
Rym: And it's just a like movie that plays out while you ride.

300
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,390
Rym: So you might as well just not even shoot.

301
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,650
Rym: Just kind of enjoy the experience.

302
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:08,610
Scott: Enjoy the scenario or just don't waste your time in this garbage game.

303
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,249
Rym: They're not the worst games.

304
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:10,730
Rym: They're just.

305
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,629
Scott: But it's still not worth your time.

306
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:17,170
Rym: What if you were unemployed and wealthy and you'd beached enough?

307
00:19:17,737 --> 00:19:18,488
Rym: Like now it's cold.

308
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,510
Scott: Go to somewhere where it's warm and continue beaching.

309
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:23,051
Rym: Yeah.

310
00:19:23,151 --> 00:19:29,510
Rym: Anyway, my real thing of the day is I remembered this Donald Duck cartoon from ages ago and I just randomly found it the other day.

311
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:33,310
Rym: It's from nineteen fifty nine, which means there's some casual racism in the middle.

312
00:19:34,092 --> 00:19:34,918
Rym: Just be warned.

313
00:19:34,998 --> 00:19:36,690
Rym: It was it was nineteen fifty nine.

314
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:37,509
Rym: That's how Disney.

315
00:19:37,852 --> 00:19:38,969
Scott: Seventy seven or fifty eight.

316
00:19:39,373 --> 00:19:40,589
Scott: No, it's fifty nine.

317
00:19:41,091 --> 00:19:46,809
Rym: But this is one of those workplace safety videos like shake hands with danger, featuring Donald Duck.

318
00:19:47,411 --> 00:19:55,150
Scott: Yeah, well, you know, Donald and the duck characters, Donald and Daffy, you know, they like to be the ones that are on the receiving end of the pain scenarios.

319
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:55,591
Rym: Yep.

320
00:19:55,953 --> 00:19:58,970
Rym: But the story of this one is Donald Duck just fucking dies.

321
00:19:59,130 --> 00:19:59,554
Rym: The end.

322
00:19:59,574 --> 00:19:59,655
Rym: It's.

323
00:20:01,896 --> 00:20:02,404
Scott: Oh, OK.

324
00:20:02,485 --> 00:20:02,688
Rym: Yeah.

325
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:10,290
Rym: Also, he has a shook hands with danger and appears to have a stereotypical 50s housewife who is not Daisy.

326
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:12,090
Rym: I don't think it's Daisy.

327
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:12,935
Rym: If it's Daisy.

328
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,910
Rym: Daisy's not doing so hot anymore.

329
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:15,660
Rym: OK.

330
00:20:15,885 --> 00:20:16,170
Rym: Anyway.

331
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,010
Rym: Well, that guy's my man.

332
00:20:20,312 --> 00:20:21,183
Rym: That's fate.

333
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:21,750
Scott: That's fate.

334
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:22,333
Rym: That's fate.

335
00:20:22,735 --> 00:20:24,970
Rym: I thought fate has a good voice actor, too.

336
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,348
Scott: I thought that was Hemingway Von Duck.

337
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:29,536
Rym: When you hear the voice.

338
00:20:29,898 --> 00:20:32,190
Rym: But anyway, we're earnest quacking way.

339
00:20:34,134 --> 00:20:35,289
Rym: It's the hat and the eyes.

340
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:35,792
Scott: I know.

341
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:37,710
Scott: Anyway, thing of the day.

342
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:42,120
Scott: So, you know, people they like to make cakes that are also objects and it's like you can't believe it's a cake.

343
00:20:42,161 --> 00:20:43,010
Scott: It looks like a sculpture.

344
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:43,652
Scott: Yeah.

345
00:20:44,356 --> 00:20:47,773
Scott: And you know, people like to make delicious cakes that are beautiful for weddings and such.

346
00:20:48,978 --> 00:20:51,750
Scott: Well, this there was a cake convention.

347
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,610
Scott: That's basically like the packs of cakes or cake conventions.

348
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:56,469
Rym: Yeah, we're doing panels at those now.

349
00:20:57,014 --> 00:20:58,090
Scott: You don't know anything about cake.

350
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,370
Rym: Our food, our food topics are real popular on gig nights.

351
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,270
Rym: I think we could do a food panel at a cake convention.

352
00:21:03,592 --> 00:21:06,290
Scott: All the people coming to your panel are people who bake cakes for a living.

353
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:06,591
Scott: Yeah.

354
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:09,030
Rym: The panel is going to be about like hot dogs or something.

355
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:19,770
Scott: But anyway, anyway, so these people had their little booth at the cake convention to advertise their cake making facilities and prowess and the cake they put on display.

356
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:24,693
Scott: They wanted to show off the fact that they could make both the sculpture cakes and also the wedding cakes.

357
00:21:25,315 --> 00:21:28,890
Scott: So their sculpture, you could just look at the sculpture.

358
00:21:29,131 --> 00:21:31,789
Scott: It is the nerdiest, best cake I've seen.

359
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,619
Scott: And, you know, what if there's not?

360
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,772
Scott: if I just describe it to you, you won't need to look at it.

361
00:21:38,937 --> 00:21:42,010
Rym: In the moment, the booklet book was The Wheel of Time.

362
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,370
Rym: Book one, famous, famous nerd book.

363
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,056
Rym: We read it.

364
00:21:45,158 --> 00:21:45,708
Rym: We reviewed it.

365
00:21:46,091 --> 00:21:48,249
Rym: We kept reading the next four books after that.

366
00:21:48,712 --> 00:21:49,989
Rym: So there's some there.

367
00:21:50,231 --> 00:21:56,140
Rym: If you want a fantasy book, the novel will probably do a nice little like follow up episode of the first four or five books or so.

368
00:21:57,487 --> 00:21:58,170
Rym: we have a Patreon.

369
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:02,510
Rym: If you give us as little as just one dollar, it's one penny, one dollar a month.

370
00:22:02,792 --> 00:22:04,010
Rym: You can't give a penny at least a dollar.

371
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,207
Scott: I think worth a penny.

372
00:22:07,213 --> 00:22:08,022
Rym: You'll get some stuff.

373
00:22:08,082 --> 00:22:08,709
Rym: Go check it out.

374
00:22:08,991 --> 00:22:19,935
Rym: We released the original nice T-shirt and let me tell you, the printing technology of this version of the T-shirt way better than what I was able to put together back in like 2007.

375
00:22:19,935 --> 00:22:21,190
Scott: Do we actually have one?

376
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:21,954
Rym: Yeah, it's.

377
00:22:22,298 --> 00:22:23,350
Rym: so there's two colors now.

378
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:28,210
Rym: You can get the shirt in cranberry like that red or gray and it looks great.

379
00:22:28,691 --> 00:22:32,196
Rym: It's also got the little gig nuts logo on the back like we always wanted to do, like Pax does.

380
00:22:32,216 --> 00:22:32,803
Rym: That's not bad.

381
00:22:33,771 --> 00:22:39,795
Rym: And it's unlike what we did before, we had one die that we paid for basically for the screening.

382
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:41,109
Rym: So it was the same size no matter what.

383
00:22:41,771 --> 00:22:42,789
Rym: Amazon just handles it.

384
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:49,910
Rym: So there's like three different kinds, like man, woman, youth and a million different sizes and actually scale the images to work for all of them.

385
00:22:50,092 --> 00:22:50,542
Scott: That's cool.

386
00:22:50,664 --> 00:22:50,930
Scott: Yeah.

387
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:56,407
Rym: And I don't have to keep a giant crate of T-shirts in the apartment and take them to the post office every day.

388
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,950
Scott: Well, if you want to waste your money on a shirt, you can go get a different one.

389
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,529
Scott: That looks a lot better than this one.

390
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,150
Rym: Six people have bought our shirt.

391
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:04,002
Scott: It's a pretty good shirt.

392
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:04,468
Scott: Why?

393
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:06,510
Scott: Just go for the same money.

394
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,850
Scott: You could have gotten like a nice awesome threadless shirt or something.

395
00:23:09,371 --> 00:23:11,789
Scott: Or what's a really good shirt these days?

396
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,148
Rym: Really good shirt these days?

397
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,810
Scott: You know, the shirt with your favorite sports team on it.

398
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:21,654
Rym: Just not the Eagles, except so I point out or any other Philadelphia team sports team shirts.

399
00:23:21,754 --> 00:23:26,351
Rym: At least get a jersey and jerseys, especially like NHL hockey jerseys, not cheap.

400
00:23:27,295 --> 00:23:33,330
Rym: There's a reason I wear my old like before they swapped dark and light again for home versus away Fedorov jersey.

401
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:40,289
Scott: I think this year might be the year where I'm going to get my my plan of sports jersey coming in a Rangers jersey right now.

402
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:43,230
Scott: See, because I never bought jerseys because it was too risky.

403
00:23:43,431 --> 00:23:43,533
Scott: Right.

404
00:23:43,573 --> 00:23:44,970
Scott: You're just going to injure someone or something.

405
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,022
Rym: See, you New York sports fans like and you can't.

406
00:23:48,042 --> 00:23:49,870
Rym: is not a concern in the middle.

407
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,310
Scott: I can't get a jersey of someone with a short contract.

408
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,090
Scott: It's got to be someone who's going to be there for a long.

409
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:54,411
Rym: Yeah.

410
00:23:54,431 --> 00:23:57,270
Rym: Like if I get my tanner glass jersey, I'd already be fine.

411
00:23:58,032 --> 00:24:01,470
Scott: You can get a jersey of someone who's like, you know, not playing anymore.

412
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,130
Scott: Like an old veteran who is already the best.

413
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:03,451
Scott: Right.

414
00:24:03,472 --> 00:24:04,076
Scott: So my plan.

415
00:24:04,197 --> 00:24:06,050
Rym: See, that's the seller cap problem in the old days.

416
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,443
Rym: Like good person on a team.

417
00:24:07,463 --> 00:24:08,150
Scott: They're there forever.

418
00:24:08,591 --> 00:24:08,832
Scott: Right.

419
00:24:08,872 --> 00:24:10,578
Scott: So I'm going to get me.

420
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:13,730
Scott: I'll get like a Rangers jersey, but on the Rangers jersey.

421
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:14,032
Scott: Is it?

422
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:15,649
Scott: No, it's not going to say Ruben.

423
00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:17,847
Scott: It'll say like number 10 Manning.

424
00:24:18,671 --> 00:24:21,137
Scott: And then I'll get like.

425
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:27,136
Scott: I'll get like a Mets jersey and on the Mets jersey, it'll be like 11 Messier.

426
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,590
Scott: That is actually a really good idea.

427
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:33,266
Scott: And I'll get a Giants jersey and the Giants jersey will be like, you know, five.

428
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:34,591
Scott: Right.

429
00:24:34,672 --> 00:24:36,409
Scott: Or Harvey is, you know, so that's clear.

430
00:24:36,832 --> 00:24:39,188
Scott: And that way you can you can wear like one.

431
00:24:39,851 --> 00:24:41,769
Scott: I don't have to wear the Rangers jersey to MSG.

432
00:24:42,331 --> 00:24:44,069
Scott: I could just wear my men's jersey to MSG.

433
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:48,990
Rym: That says 11 minutes here on the bonus points because someone who notices what's up.

434
00:24:49,171 --> 00:24:52,530
Scott: If I go to a Rangers, if I go in a Rangers game, we're in the Rangers jersey.

435
00:24:52,712 --> 00:24:54,370
Scott: It still says 10 Manning on the back.

436
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,069
Scott: So people would be like, oh, Giants fan.

437
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,810
Rym: So they changed the format of NHL jersey.

438
00:24:57,911 --> 00:24:59,090
Rym: So I got my old Fedorov jersey.

439
00:24:59,311 --> 00:25:02,210
Scott: I got to figure out what size because they're all designed to have pads under them.

440
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:06,470
Rym: So what I'm going to do is I'm going to get a Rangers jersey this year because the Rangers are doing real well so far.

441
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,404
Scott: Look at this front runner.

442
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:07,730
Scott: Not even.

443
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,990
Scott: No, you don't even have loyalty, let alone superstition.

444
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:10,754
Rym: What about?

445
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,490
Rym: I've been loyal to the Red Wings my whole life and I still am.

446
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:15,049
Scott: Why are you buying a Rangers jersey?

447
00:25:15,411 --> 00:25:18,390
Rym: Because they're my number two and I've lived in New York for a long time.

448
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,729
Scott: OK, I got a lot of number twos.

449
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:22,210
Scott: I am not going to ever buy a jersey for any number two ever.

450
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:27,030
Rym: The thing is, I got to admit, I want the Red Wings to win the Stanley Cup.

451
00:25:27,931 --> 00:25:31,850
Rym: I don't think this is their year, but the Rangers, I think, have a real shot.

452
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:36,849
Scott: The trick is with the Rangers jersey, you got to buy the one that doesn't say Rangers on the front has to be the one that says New York on the front.

453
00:25:36,931 --> 00:25:37,888
Scott: No, that's the key.

454
00:25:39,051 --> 00:25:43,030
Rym: See, I don't buy your New York cursing issues here.

455
00:25:43,111 --> 00:25:43,801
Scott: That's the problem.

456
00:25:44,045 --> 00:25:44,309
Rym: Yeah.

457
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:49,550
Scott: But so my plan is you don't know enough of the history of what's happened.

458
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52,370
Rym: The Red Wings jersey will fit over the Rangers jersey.

459
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:58,710
Rym: So if I go to a game that matters, like if it comes down to Red Wings, Rangers, somehow I can wear both.

460
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,990
Rym: And as soon as the Red Wings lose, I can take that off and reveal my Rangers.

461
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,270
Scott: That's the worst thing I've ever heard.

462
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,268
Rym: But I'm a fan of both teams.

463
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,529
Scott: That's the worst thing I've ever heard.

464
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,489
Rym: In fact, I'd be OK if this.

465
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,610
Rym: Yeah, well, no, there's some teams I would not be OK with.

466
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,785
Scott: If someone sort of beaten you up in the parking lot or sidewalk.

467
00:26:14,831 --> 00:26:17,690
Rym: Look, as long as I would just let them, as long as Philadelphia.

468
00:26:18,471 --> 00:26:21,169
Scott: And if some cops came to stop it, I'd be like, whoa, hold up.

469
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,449
Scott: That guy who's wearing both jerseys, he's like, oh, OK.

470
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,749
Scott: And they'd wait a minute before they took.

471
00:26:26,414 --> 00:26:31,630
Rym: As long as Philadelphia, the New Jersey Devils, the Avalanche don't win the Stanley Cup.

472
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:32,690
Rym: That's really all I care about.

473
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:33,870
Scott: You don't have to worry about the Avalanche.

474
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:34,580
Rym: No, I don't.

475
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:35,010
Rym: They're done.

476
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,589
Rym: They've pretty much been done for a long time.

477
00:26:39,652 --> 00:26:46,050
Rym: Anyway, so we've talked about this when we've reviewed other games in general, many, many, many times.

478
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:50,610
Rym: We actually submitted to do a lecture on this at PAX Prime, but they wanted our esports lecture instead.

479
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:51,810
Rym: So we're keeping this in the wing.

480
00:26:51,870 --> 00:27:02,030
Rym: We might do this as a straight up lecture at a future convention, maybe PAX South or maybe MagFest, but rules of games are a real important thing.

481
00:27:02,792 --> 00:27:11,069
Rym: And especially when it comes to Kickstarter tabletop games, I feel like that is like the first thing that they seem to fuck up.

482
00:27:12,712 --> 00:27:19,668
Rym: And I don't know why and how it is that like the rules of a game are actually the hardest thing for people to deal with.

483
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:24,230
Scott: Because people don't want to read the rules because reading rules sucks.

484
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,254
Rym: But look at this.

485
00:27:25,295 --> 00:27:26,610
Rym: It's a problem across all kinds of games.

486
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:32,141
Rym: So tabletop, you have the situation of no one wants to read the rules of the game because reading rules is not fun.

487
00:27:32,202 --> 00:27:32,988
Scott: It's a pain in the ass.

488
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,328
Rym: You just don't want to teach the game.

489
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,710
Scott: But teaching is not so bad if you know the rules already.

490
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:44,370
Rym: But then you've got the situation of the people who want to play the game, but don't want to learn the rules, which is fine.

491
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,054
Scott: There are people.

492
00:27:45,115 --> 00:27:46,970
Scott: Yeah, I still I don't mind teaching a game.

493
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:52,010
Scott: What I mind is people who don't want to like pay attention when you're teaching, they're just like, just let me play and I'll figure it out.

494
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:59,690
Rym: It's which would be fine, except those same people get super butter when they lose the game at the end because they didn't know about the special victory points.

495
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:02,149
Scott: Yeah, maybe they should listen to the rules.

496
00:28:02,711 --> 00:28:06,738
Rym: But you have the added dimension there with tabletop that and people teach the.

497
00:28:07,101 --> 00:28:08,090
Scott: sometimes you don't read the rules.

498
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,406
Scott: Someone teaches them to you and they teach him wrong.

499
00:28:10,467 --> 00:28:10,809
Rym: Yeah.

500
00:28:11,511 --> 00:28:14,970
Rym: So but you have the problem where you have to implement the rules.

501
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,087
Rym: You have to know them and implement them.

502
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:17,450
Scott: Yep.

503
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:33,549
Rym: But video games actually have the same problem, because when you design a game like the rules of the game are your code and independently, there's also the argument that the rules of the game are what you give, what information you give the player to where they will then assume things about how the game behaves.

504
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,410
Scott: Well, it's the Mega Man, Mega Man video, right?

505
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,154
Scott: The guy points out how.

506
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:38,530
Scott: Mega Man X, you don't need to know the rules.

507
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,329
Scott: You don't need to read the instruction book to play Mega Man X. You just start pushing buttons.

508
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:49,667
Scott: And, you know, I like to imagine, you know, the rules of a video game or any game as sort of like these walls encircling like rails.

509
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,809
Rym: They're like you're playing a bumper bowling.

510
00:28:52,151 --> 00:28:52,412
Scott: Right.

511
00:28:52,472 --> 00:28:56,170
Scott: It's like imagine, you know, the entire universe is a big white sheet.

512
00:28:56,731 --> 00:28:56,973
Scott: Right.

513
00:28:57,033 --> 00:29:01,546
Scott: And you can do anything except the laws of physics are on the edges keeping you in.

514
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:01,970
Scott: Right.

515
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:05,128
Scott: You can't do things that break the laws of physics, but you can do anything else.

516
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,250
Scott: You know, those are the rules of the universe.

517
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,269
Scott: You know, these walls.

518
00:29:08,731 --> 00:29:11,450
Scott: Well, and a game is a much smaller space.

519
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,190
Scott: So inside the laws of physics is another wall, right?

520
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,708
Scott: A circular wall you can't get out of.

521
00:29:16,173 --> 00:29:17,790
Scott: And that's the rules of a particular game.

522
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:22,150
Scott: And so you're inside these walls and you don't know the rules to the game.

523
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,190
Scott: You can't see the walls.

524
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,390
Scott: You don't know where they are, but you know that they exist.

525
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:30,109
Scott: So you start moving around and exploring the space of what will this game let me do?

526
00:29:30,594 --> 00:29:31,950
Scott: And eventually you bump into a wall.

527
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,590
Scott: It's like, for example, you're playing Super Mario Brothers.

528
00:29:34,152 --> 00:29:38,870
Scott: You press A and you jump and you're like, oh boy, you can see Mario jumps that high.

529
00:29:39,032 --> 00:29:40,430
Scott: That's what you just encountered a wall.

530
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:49,250
Scott: And you're sort of as you're exploring this space, you figure out, you know, by sort of putting your hand against the wall and pushing the limits right where the walls are.

531
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,582
Scott: You can learn a video game.

532
00:29:50,602 --> 00:29:56,049
Scott: that's simple enough just by trying and trying and trying and seeing what the game lets you do.

533
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,230
Rym: And even complex games.

534
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,990
Scott: And you don't need someone to teach you the rules.

535
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,090
Scott: You need to read a rule book.

536
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,910
Scott: You don't need someone to tell you where the walls are, though.

537
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:02,637
Scott: That could help.

538
00:30:03,042 --> 00:30:03,750
Scott: It's not necessary.

539
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:10,490
Scott: You don't need those tutorial bullshit that's in every game these days, because you can just explore the rules space and discover the rules of the game.

540
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:16,929
Scott: But if a game is too fucking complicated, like I know Europa Universalis, whatever, or even subterfuge.

541
00:30:17,251 --> 00:30:17,532
Rym: Right.

542
00:30:18,035 --> 00:30:21,030
Scott: You need something to read to tell you what things do.

543
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:24,749
Scott: I mean, you could explore because the game's code is keeping you in.

544
00:30:25,212 --> 00:30:27,150
Scott: You could explore and figure out the rules.

545
00:30:27,271 --> 00:30:28,181
Scott: But if you do, you will.

546
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:35,830
Scott: It'll take so long because the rule, the shape of those those walls are so complicated, like with Europa Universalis.

547
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:40,950
Rym: I remember we were trying to play a game with a bunch of friends and I see all these sliders of political stuff and I'm like, huh?

548
00:30:41,353 --> 00:30:43,009
Rym: And I take one and I move it a little bit.

549
00:30:43,715 --> 00:30:45,389
Rym: Think wondering, I wonder what that'll do.

550
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:48,307
Rym: And suddenly, like all my people died and everything was over.

551
00:30:48,327 --> 00:30:48,609
Rym: Right.

552
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,361
Rym: And that didn't help me.

553
00:30:50,421 --> 00:30:51,450
Rym: That didn't tell me where the wall was.

554
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,099
Rym: It just killed me.

555
00:30:52,403 --> 00:30:52,830
Scott: Exactly.

556
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:59,750
Scott: So the game is too complicated, even though you could theoretically explore to figure out the way the game works because it's a video game.

557
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:01,199
Scott: It's just too big.

558
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,449
Scott: There's too much going on.

559
00:31:03,472 --> 00:31:05,849
Scott: It's not a nice, simple rocket league that you can figure out.

560
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:11,810
Rym: Now, the worst thing is a single player non-competitive game can have the same sort of adverse problem.

561
00:31:11,892 --> 00:31:12,488
Rym: So imagine this.

562
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:18,605
Rym: Imagine a game like Fallout or like a very long form game where like it's a long single player, 20, 30, 40 hour narrative.

563
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:23,950
Rym: Tactics games and fire emblems and things have these problems a lot.

564
00:31:24,331 --> 00:31:24,890
Rym: Yogurt battles.

565
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,170
Rym: Like, yeah, you can play the game and bumper around and you're fine.

566
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:36,248
Rym: But then you get 20 hours into the game and find out that, oh, because you did do the magic thing 18 hours ago because he didn't know because blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

567
00:31:36,531 --> 00:31:37,678
Rym: Now you can't do the other thing.

568
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:38,443
Rym: Fuck you.

569
00:31:38,624 --> 00:31:39,329
Rym: Start over.

570
00:31:41,754 --> 00:31:43,930
Rym: And no, the answer to that is to not start over.

571
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,123
Rym: The answer is not play games like that.

572
00:31:45,143 --> 00:31:45,528
Rym: Exactly.

573
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:49,190
Rym: That's why people want strategy guides and facts for games like that.

574
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:53,610
Scott: But I think a lot of those games are made in such a way as to intentionally sell a strategy guide.

575
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:56,690
Scott: Ogre battles, ogre battle 64 specifically.

576
00:31:58,412 --> 00:31:58,554
Scott: Yeah.

577
00:31:58,574 --> 00:32:00,130
Scott: Where you have to like go ogre battle.

578
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:04,330
Scott: If you don't know, ogre battle 64 is like an in-game calendar and clock that is always progressing.

579
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:18,649
Scott: And if you had in order to get like this particular really strong unit, you have to go back to the very first map of the whole game, go into the map at a certain day at a certain time and go into this house at a certain day at a certain time and talk to the person there.

580
00:32:19,172 --> 00:32:22,741
Scott: And at the beginning of the game, this is basically like, you know, in Zelda one, you go into it and it's like.

581
00:32:22,862 --> 00:32:25,049
Scott: old man says something like the dog got this like smoke.

582
00:32:25,473 --> 00:32:26,448
Scott: It's that kind of house.

583
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:43,730
Scott: Imagine if if you went into the old man's like room at November 30th, 2027, the old man said, oh, I bet you'd like to have 75 bombs instead of saying to don, go dislike smoke and be like, get the fuck old man.

584
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:45,388
Scott: How was I supposed to possibly know that?

585
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:50,070
Rym: Well, the strategy guide will cost you five fifty nine ninety nine.

586
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,170
Scott: Well, I think the strategy guide for that game is twenty five.

587
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:54,730
Scott: But and I only know this because my brother bought that strategy guide.

588
00:32:55,672 --> 00:32:56,441
Scott: But anyway.

589
00:32:56,462 --> 00:32:56,542
Scott: Yeah.

590
00:32:57,411 --> 00:33:02,790
Scott: So it's even possible for a video game if the walls of the game are complex enough that you can't learn them on your own.

591
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,670
Scott: But a board game, any tabletop game whatsoever.

592
00:33:06,654 --> 00:33:07,909
Scott: There are no walls.

593
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:13,209
Scott: If you don't read the rule book and don't have a rule book or whatever, you can do whatever you want.

594
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:16,869
Scott: It's like take a monopoly board, open it up, just throw it on the board.

595
00:33:17,152 --> 00:33:20,790
Scott: It's like you can just reach into the bank and grab all the five hundreds and put them in front of you.

596
00:33:21,011 --> 00:33:21,789
Scott: It doesn't stop you.

597
00:33:22,132 --> 00:33:26,669
Scott: You can take your little battleship or iron, because those are the best pieces, and just move them on the boardwalk.

598
00:33:27,512 --> 00:33:28,929
Scott: Nothing stopping you from doing that.

599
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:33,170
Rym: So maybe your friends, but they didn't read the rules, so they don't actually have any basis for what they're doing.

600
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:33,452
Scott: Right.

601
00:33:33,472 --> 00:33:34,450
Scott: It's like you just do stuff.

602
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,450
Scott: You just take a properties, just grab them and put them.

603
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:40,970
Scott: It's like there's no physical thing preventing you from doing whatever you want.

604
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,725
Scott: You need to.

605
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:54,190
Scott: The people playing the game need to know the rules correctly and then enforce the rules upon themselves and the other players in order to play a tabletop game of any kind or an RPG or anything.

606
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,877
Scott: So what that means?

607
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,609
Scott: to know the rules, a human being has to know them.

608
00:33:59,532 --> 00:34:01,138
Scott: That means a human being has to read them.

609
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:03,950
Scott: and now I sucks balls.

610
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:13,688
Rym: I noticed something very interesting recently because a lot of popular tabletop games like Juggers and Euphrates, I think Pandemic and all those kinds of games.

611
00:34:14,351 --> 00:34:26,310
Rym: There are tablet and phone versions like Carcassonne that give you the bump against the rails method of learning without the frustration of your ruining a game that a bunch of other people are trying to play.

612
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:26,851
Scott: Right.

613
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:31,289
Scott: There's also people out there who seem to like they don't want to be taught the rules or read them.

614
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,489
Scott: They just want someone else to read them.

615
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:37,090
Scott: And then they want to bump against the walls enforced by a human being.

616
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,107
Scott: Like I know settlers, you don't.

617
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:43,049
Scott: But you want to play settlers immediately and just start playing and have me tell you what to do.

618
00:34:43,231 --> 00:34:44,609
Rym: Can I can I build a settlement there?

619
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,370
Scott: No, you can't because you don't have a grain.

620
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:47,107
Rym: What about there?

621
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:50,210
Scott: You know, because that's one space away from someone else.

622
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:50,451
Scott: Right.

623
00:34:50,532 --> 00:34:56,529
Scott: And it's like basically just learn the game by bumping where to make a human being be the bumpers, be the walls for you.

624
00:34:57,171 --> 00:35:01,841
Scott: And while that can work and you might be really nice to provide that from someone.

625
00:35:01,881 --> 00:35:02,810
Rym: I'm not that nice anymore.

626
00:35:03,272 --> 00:35:06,570
Scott: It's that's really rude, I think, to ask someone to do that for you.

627
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:10,869
Scott: It's like you can't be bothered to read or listen to the explanation that they're going to offer you.

628
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,450
Scott: So you're just like insisting that they be a computer for you.

629
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,197
Scott: It's like, fuck you.

630
00:35:14,419 --> 00:35:15,429
Scott: You know, that's so rude.

631
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:23,008
Rym: But that might be one way around this problem for tabletop, or at least one way to really help is by releasing a version of your game that's digital.

632
00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:26,123
Rym: It's not the same fun experience for a lot of reasons.

633
00:35:26,143 --> 00:35:27,550
Rym: like the UX is not there.

634
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:32,490
Scott: But people who play Carcassonne on their iPad can then play Carcassonne in person with a lot less trouble.

635
00:35:32,671 --> 00:35:32,872
Rym: Yep.

636
00:35:33,113 --> 00:35:41,610
Rym: But at the same time, I've noticed that those kinds of people will often miss a rule or not actually understand how something goes down.

637
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:42,214
Scott: Because when?

638
00:35:42,235 --> 00:35:47,730
Scott: well, this is something I noticed, too, because a lot of people play these janky ghetto, non-official online net runners.

639
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:59,630
Scott: And especially when a game automates something for you without you doing it explicitly, when you play in person and you have to actually do something, you may not realize after playing it digitally.

640
00:36:00,098 --> 00:36:00,850
Scott: that that was a thing.

641
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:05,330
Scott: For example, you play Carcassonne just on your phone and you get to the end of the scoring and it's done.

642
00:36:05,712 --> 00:36:08,490
Scott: You might not actually fully realize how farms are scored.

643
00:36:08,771 --> 00:36:11,327
Rym: And there's also three variants of how to score farms.

644
00:36:11,509 --> 00:36:11,730
Rym: Right.

645
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:18,230
Scott: And if you play, you know, Netrunner, it's like a lot of people come in to play Netrunner in person after playing it with some janky online thing.

646
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:22,570
Scott: And they'll forget like, oh, that thing gives me a credit every turn.

647
00:36:22,953 --> 00:36:24,750
Scott: I was getting that credit automatically every turn.

648
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,229
Scott: I keep forgetting to give it to myself.

649
00:36:26,411 --> 00:36:33,350
Scott: And now they fucked up, because when you play that game in person, you have to remember a lot of things and go through it very methodically.

650
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:37,729
Scott: But you don't develop that methodology because you don't need it when you're at computers doing it for you.

651
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:59,136
Rym: Now, I feel like there's a whole separate topic we could do if we did that lecture, for example, or just in the show on writing rules, which actually has two factors, again, because if you're looking at a video game effectively writing the rules is either the game design itself or what you present to the player, be it a rule book, tutorials, bumpers, Megaman, Megaman, whatever

652
00:36:59,176 --> 00:36:59,537
Scott: it is to

653
00:37:00,521 --> 00:37:02,630
Rym: give the person the map to the game.

654
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:07,629
Rym: But with tabletop, it's the words you wrote in that book and the examples you give.

655
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:17,270
Rym: And pretty much every Kickstarter tabletop game I've ever seen, with very few exceptions, has the second worst rules ever.

656
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,169
Rym: Hell is being the worst.

657
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,376
Scott: Well, some things you can do.

658
00:37:19,436 --> 00:37:30,490
Scott: if you're making a tabletop game these days, if it's not like a giant RPG with a million rules, you can make videos on YouTube explaining the rules, which might be better than a rule book and might be more helpful.

659
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:31,295
Scott: But there's still.

660
00:37:31,355 --> 00:37:34,361
Scott: someone has to watch it and pay attention to it and comprehend it.

661
00:37:34,603 --> 00:37:34,846
Rym: Yep.

662
00:37:35,028 --> 00:37:35,210
Rym: Right.

663
00:37:35,531 --> 00:37:37,709
Scott: I mean, just look at the stupid Wil Wheaton tabletop show.

664
00:37:37,871 --> 00:37:40,149
Scott: That's a you know, how many times they got the rules wrong.

665
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:41,317
Rym: They had one job.

666
00:37:41,982 --> 00:37:42,909
Rym: Yeah, they couldn't do that.

667
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:47,230
Rym: Their only goal was to play tabletop game and teach you how to play it.

668
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,049
Rym: And they couldn't even manage that.

669
00:37:49,211 --> 00:37:51,170
Scott: Yeah, I think they ranted about that when it was a news.

670
00:37:51,411 --> 00:37:52,549
Scott: So we'll pass on it again.

671
00:37:53,012 --> 00:37:54,669
Rym: Yeah, you can go read about all that.

672
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:57,970
Rym: But but it's real simple in a lot of ways.

673
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:58,436
Rym: It's just people.

674
00:37:58,456 --> 00:37:59,290
Rym: don't put the care into it.

675
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:03,941
Rym: It's like the people who are writing the rules to tabletop games lately in the

676
00:38:04,102 --> 00:38:04,485
Rym: U.S.,

677
00:38:04,546 --> 00:38:05,070
Rym: especially.

678
00:38:05,712 --> 00:38:11,470
Rym: It's like they've never read the rules to the old classic German games, which had very, very well-written rules.

679
00:38:12,155 --> 00:38:13,209
Rym: You got to look at it like an RFC.

680
00:38:13,351 --> 00:38:16,350
Rym: You've got there's like there's pretty standard language for describing a process.

681
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:22,090
Rym: Use, you know, terms like may, may not really only need is may and must.

682
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:25,110
Scott: You really shouldn't use things like shall, because it's a little ambiguous.

683
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:25,714
Scott: Right.

684
00:38:25,734 --> 00:38:27,289
Scott: May and must are the key words.

685
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:27,612
Scott: Yep.

686
00:38:27,794 --> 00:38:29,089
Rym: Never on your turn.

687
00:38:29,493 --> 00:38:31,349
Rym: You may draw a card at the start.

688
00:38:31,771 --> 00:38:34,330
Rym: You must discard a card at the end.

689
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,670
Rym: That is unambiguous.

690
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,510
Rym: Your language has to be unambiguous.

691
00:38:39,911 --> 00:38:46,650
Scott: I feel like then there cannot be situations where, you know, oh, what if I, you know, it's like, all right, first you play a card, then you draw a card.

692
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:47,338
Scott: That's your whole turn.

693
00:38:47,379 --> 00:38:48,229
Scott: Play a card, draw a card.

694
00:38:48,611 --> 00:38:51,570
Scott: Well, what if I play this card that says draw two cards?

695
00:38:51,631 --> 00:38:53,110
Scott: Do I still draw a card at the end of my turn?

696
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,750
Scott: Because you said I had this and that.

697
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:57,050
Scott: And it's like there's a maximum hand size or not.

698
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:00,170
Scott: It's like it doesn't say anything about whether there's a maximum hand size.

699
00:39:00,451 --> 00:39:02,389
Scott: Oh, I guess I just have this giant hand of cards now.

700
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,610
Rym: And then the answer is, yes, play.

701
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:05,253
Rym: You should like.

702
00:39:05,273 --> 00:39:12,710
Scott: when you play a game, when you read the rules, like, for example, if you wanted the people to have a no maximum hand size, you can't just not say anything.

703
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:17,650
Scott: You actually have to say, oh, yes, you may have as many cards in your hand as you wish.

704
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,610
Scott: You need to be explicit about every single detail.

705
00:39:21,012 --> 00:39:25,550
Scott: So no one can possibly have any questions or contradictions of any kind whatsoever.

706
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:29,630
Rym: You also can't bury that shit in the middle of a paragraph describing something else.

707
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:33,130
Scott: Yeah, the structure needs to be step one, the objective of the game.

708
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,769
Rym: The objective of the game is to win two.

709
00:39:36,353 --> 00:39:36,657
Scott: Well, how?

710
00:39:36,677 --> 00:39:37,650
Scott: what constitutes winning?

711
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,890
Rym: You win by collecting the most victory points at the end of the game.

712
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,368
Scott: Then the setup of the game.

713
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:44,702
Rym: Take these X pieces, arrange them like this.

714
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:45,970
Rym: Twenty dollars to each person.

715
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,110
Rym: Everyone starts with two cards.

716
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:48,770
Scott: Well, these are what these pieces are called.

717
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,110
Rym: The oldest player goes first.

718
00:39:50,191 --> 00:39:50,921
Rym: This is a merchant.

719
00:39:50,941 --> 00:39:51,650
Rym: This is a trader.

720
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:52,542
Rym: This is a dog.

721
00:39:52,563 --> 00:39:52,849
Rym: Right.

722
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:54,550
Scott: Then turn structure.

723
00:39:54,711 --> 00:39:59,010
Scott: Do these things in this order very specifically, so on and so forth.

724
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:03,110
Rym: You may do this, then you may do one of these one and only one.

725
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:04,550
Rym: That is one of your favorite terms.

726
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:09,290
Rym: One and only one of these three possible action.

727
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,776
Scott: Right.

728
00:40:10,796 --> 00:40:13,470
Scott: Then you say what constitutes the game ending?

729
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:18,250
Rym: The game ends when someone runs out of dogs or there are more than 20 dogs out on the board.

730
00:40:18,611 --> 00:40:27,110
Rym: And then you say how to determine who won after the end is ahead of the victory points in this specific order, this specific way, wherever the most wins.

731
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:32,450
Rym: In the case of a tie to have a fistfight in the winner of the fistfight.

732
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:36,970
Rym: When if the fistfight is also a draw, then rejoice in your shared victory.

733
00:40:38,673 --> 00:40:38,855
Scott: Right.

734
00:40:38,916 --> 00:40:40,370
Scott: That's how you write every game.

735
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:43,070
Scott: Every tabletop game rulebook should be written that way ever.

736
00:40:43,371 --> 00:40:50,090
Rym: If your rulebook does not follow that basic format, either you are a genius or more likely your game sucks.

737
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:52,050
Scott: It's the old, you know, it's the old cliche, right?

738
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,789
Scott: You can break the rules once you know the rules.

739
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:54,251
Rym: Yep.

740
00:40:54,593 --> 00:40:57,210
Scott: Once you've already mastered the rules, then you're allowed to break them.

741
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:59,170
Rym: Yeah, that applies to every profession in the world.

742
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:03,370
Rym: When I took music theory classes, the professor was like, these are the rules of writing music.

743
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:09,156
Rym: If you follow those rules, you're guaranteed to result in music that a human can listen to and not want to vomit.

744
00:41:10,061 --> 00:41:11,689
Rym: If you break these rules, may God help you.

745
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:16,610
Scott: So there are common mistakes I see in tabletop, but also RPG rules.

746
00:41:17,531 --> 00:41:28,209
Scott: Common mistake number one, writing the same rules in like different places in the book so people can't, when people want to look something up, they can't find it or it's in two different places and it's worded slightly differently in both places.

747
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,054
Rym: Luke.

748
00:41:29,074 --> 00:41:29,701
Rym: Luke.

749
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:30,065
Scott: Sorry, Luke.

750
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:31,998
Scott: And they're like, oh, God damn it.

751
00:41:32,562 --> 00:41:33,227
Scott: So pissed off.

752
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:40,510
Scott: If there's a rule about, say, you know, the dogs, all the dog-related rules should be in the dog section.

753
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:44,550
Rym: Now you can reference and restate those rules in other places.

754
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:48,209
Scott: With the exact same language, not differing by a single word.

755
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:52,786
Rym: But all the rules about dogs have to be in the dog chapter.

756
00:41:53,147 --> 00:41:53,910
Scott: Every single one.

757
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,556
Rym: There can be no exception.

758
00:41:55,576 --> 00:41:58,990
Rym: that is not in the dog section regarding dogs.

759
00:41:59,350 --> 00:41:59,472
Scott: Mm-hmm.

760
00:41:59,961 --> 00:42:00,368
Scott: That's right.

761
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:05,950
Rym: The other common mistake number two, not accounting for all possible game states.

762
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:11,750
Scott: Yeah, there might be a scenario where, oh, well, OK, we've read all the rules and we're playing the game.

763
00:42:12,353 --> 00:42:13,016
Scott: Oh, wait a minute.

764
00:42:13,237 --> 00:42:16,070
Scott: There's three guys in that place and two guys in that place.

765
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:23,190
Scott: But the rule says that, wow, that's not a possibility that the rules accounted for.

766
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,108
Scott: I don't know what to do now.

767
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:36,250
Rym: Now, this is handled, one, by being super clever and actually playtesting your game so thoroughly that the odds of a situation that could occur actually occurring at some point approaches one.

768
00:42:36,832 --> 00:42:39,810
Rym: But even if you don't do that, there's a pretty easy way out.

769
00:42:40,271 --> 00:42:53,090
Rym: You've got to have a very consistent guiding principle in the rules so that if there is an unaccounted for situation, the rest of the body of rules combined allows players to deduce the correct behavior.

770
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:53,870
Scott: Right.

771
00:42:53,891 --> 00:42:58,510
Scott: Imagine if there's a game with cards and one card said, get five dollars no matter what.

772
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:04,870
Scott: And another person had a card that said, cancel someone else's card no matter what, which no matter what wins.

773
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:08,650
Rym: And now you've got to go through the rest of the rules and see how similar situations are handled.

774
00:43:08,951 --> 00:43:16,129
Scott: And if your rules are well written, any education will be able to look up that particular card in the in the reference of the rule book.

775
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:23,790
Scott: And it'll say, aha, no matter what cards cannot be beaten, no matter what, even by other no matter what cards.

776
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:25,990
Rym: So Glory to Rome is a great example of this.

777
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:30,510
Rym: It actually has really well written rules, despite the fact that somehow everyone fucks up this game and plays it wrong.

778
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:31,670
Rym: But they don't read the rules.

779
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:31,951
Scott: Yeah.

780
00:43:32,173 --> 00:43:34,289
Scott: If you don't read them, it doesn't matter how written they are.

781
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:41,310
Rym: But if you read the rules of Glory to Rome, they have a very clear guiding principle that if a card ends up doing something crazy.

782
00:43:41,711 --> 00:43:42,194
Rym: Yeah.

783
00:43:42,878 --> 00:43:44,610
Rym: Like everything is absolute.

784
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:47,650
Rym: The rules make it very clear that whatever happens, happens.

785
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:48,775
Rym: And that is absolute.

786
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:51,008
Rym: If it seems broken, well, yeah, go for it.

787
00:43:51,510 --> 00:44:03,190
Rym: So independent of that, later in the other section of the book, it lists every single card in the game, explains that card in deep detail, deeper than you think you need.

788
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:11,470
Rym: And it then lists pretty much every possible interaction that card could have with another card that might be strange or difficult to parse.

789
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:20,388
Rym: So by having both a consistent guiding principle and very clear examples of all the interactions, they cover themselves 100 percent.

790
00:44:21,671 --> 00:44:28,850
Rym: And the few situations that aren't covered by those rules, and there are a few, are easily decided by a reading of the rest of the rules.

791
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:29,775
Scott: Like it talks about.

792
00:44:29,816 --> 00:44:31,790
Scott: like if you look and the thing is, they do it both ways.

793
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:32,930
Scott: I'm pretty sure they do it both ways.

794
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:37,130
Scott: It's been a while since I read that rule book, but like let's say there's the sewer and the latrine.

795
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:41,650
Scott: I don't even know if those cards work together or not, but I don't forget what the latrine does.

796
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:47,769
Scott: But let's say for example, yeah, let's pretend that they work together, the sewer and the latrine, because it makes sense that they would based on their theme.

797
00:44:48,671 --> 00:44:51,570
Scott: Pretend it's not even glory to Rome, just in case I'm, you know, being stupid.

798
00:44:52,352 --> 00:44:57,850
Scott: If you look in the sewer card in that reference next to sewer, it'll tell you the rule for interacting with the latrine.

799
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:00,130
Scott: If you look in the latrine section, it'll tell you about the sewer.

800
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:00,613
Scott: Yes.

801
00:45:00,855 --> 00:45:02,310
Scott: In exactly the same language.

802
00:45:02,451 --> 00:45:06,170
Scott: That way, no matter which one you look up, you'll find it and you won't be like, derp, derp, derp, derp.

803
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:09,077
Rym: But number three, you know, rule, common to say.

804
00:45:09,097 --> 00:45:14,270
Rym: number three, inconsistency, that only works if your rules are actually consistent.

805
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:23,690
Rym: If you have rules and then you have the list of examples, but the exceptions and the interactions don't really like, they don't make sense.

806
00:45:23,811 --> 00:45:25,410
Rym: Like you read them like, oh, that's weird.

807
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:27,170
Rym: I guess those two cards just work a different way.

808
00:45:27,871 --> 00:45:32,090
Rym: One, that usually means the game failed in playtesting and the game designer just kind of made a hack.

809
00:45:32,552 --> 00:45:34,370
Rym: And two, the game probably sucks.

810
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:38,450
Rym: Inconsistent rules are worse than missing rules.

811
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:48,310
Scott: The more mistakes a rule book has like this, you clearly, the less thought and the less testing the people who made the game put into it is a sign the game is probably not good and not worth playing.

812
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:50,428
Rym: That usually comes out of, I've seen this happen.

813
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:58,470
Scott: It's very rare you see a really good game with really poorly written rules and it's really rare you see a really bad game with really good rules.

814
00:45:58,831 --> 00:46:08,230
Rym: When I see a popular game that has bad rules, or especially a kickstarted tabletop game, usually what I think happened is they had mostly their friends playtesting the game.

815
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:15,590
Rym: And, you know, a group of people playing the same game over and over starts to assume a game culture and game expectations.

816
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:31,790
Rym: So like when me, Scott and our friend Alex, we played Puerto Rico hundreds and hundreds of times, we sort of got into a rhythm and the expectations about how to play that if we played suddenly with a third different person other than Alex, the game might go way differently and we might not expect things to go the way they went.

817
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:47,830
Rym: So if the same people keep playtesting your game, they might start playing a rule wrong and there's no one to point it out to them and they just assume that's how the game works and they never look at the rule book again so they never notice the ambiguity.

818
00:46:50,091 --> 00:47:08,410
Rym: The inconsistency is also a problem in general in terms of if your rules have a lot of exceptions, like if your game is relatively simple, like it's a standard German style tabletop game that takes one and a half hours to play but your rule book is 40 pages long, the game's probably overcomplicated and poorly designed.

819
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:11,337
Rym: The rules should be pretty succinct.

820
00:47:11,417 --> 00:47:15,950
Rym: If a concept can't be explained succinctly, most likely there's something wrong with your game.

821
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:30,170
Scott: There's also a lot of situations, I forgot to mention this earlier, video games especially, where there are hidden rules that you couldn't possibly, even if you bumped into every wall, it would be so next to impossible to figure them out because they're hidden.

822
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:48,708
Scott: For example, if you give somebody a brand new game of Street Fighter 2, they might see that Ryu is throwing Hadoukens at them, but if it wasn't printed on the cabinet how to do a Hadouken, there's no way that they would ever figure that out.

823
00:47:48,788 --> 00:47:50,370
Scott: How would they ever figure out how to do it?

824
00:47:50,612 --> 00:47:51,930
Scott: It would be so difficult.

825
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:53,097
Rym: Trial and error.

826
00:47:53,521 --> 00:47:54,309
Rym: Game facts.

827
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:56,253
Scott: Like they're smashing the joystick around.

828
00:47:56,353 --> 00:47:58,256
Scott: One might pop out, but they won't know what they did.

829
00:47:58,816 --> 00:48:01,480
Scott: And then even if I see people, they'll use diagrams, right?

830
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:05,526
Scott: And the diagram shows the joystick making the quarter circle and then the punch button.

831
00:48:05,867 --> 00:48:07,830
Scott: And there'll be usually like a plus sign in between them.

832
00:48:07,911 --> 00:48:09,130
Rym: Doesn't tell you about the timing.

833
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:09,691
Scott: Right.

834
00:48:09,931 --> 00:48:11,773
Scott: Even if you have that, right?

835
00:48:11,813 --> 00:48:16,157
Scott: You might know, okay, I'll move the joystick down to the bottom, then make it a quarter circle.

836
00:48:16,177 --> 00:48:18,079
Scott: so now it's facing forward and then push a button.

837
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:24,285
Scott: Wait, do I push the button after the stick reaches forward or just as the stick reaches forward?

838
00:48:24,345 --> 00:48:27,568
Scott: Or do I hold the button down the whole time while I'm moving the stick in this motion?

839
00:48:28,028 --> 00:48:29,890
Scott: Or do I hit the button and then move the stick?

840
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:34,230
Rym: What about the frame timing stuff of like preloading additional actions and all that frame nonsense?

841
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:34,510
Scott: Right.

842
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:38,535
Scott: None of that is explained to you in any of these things.

843
00:48:38,955 --> 00:48:39,676
Scott: And there's no.

844
00:48:39,796 --> 00:48:41,558
Scott: it's because it's so obtuse.

845
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:47,965
Scott: It's almost impossible to figure it out without someone just telling you or showing you.

846
00:48:48,305 --> 00:48:51,088
Scott: And the game does a very bad job of telling you or showing you.

847
00:48:51,508 --> 00:48:53,050
Scott: And that is a real big problem.

848
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:54,252
Rym: Now that is an example.

849
00:48:54,272 --> 00:49:05,526
Rym: That's why I do believe, you know, in our game design panels, I talk a lot about how designing for tabletop will teach you the fundamentals of all game design because the game has to be simple enough to be played with physical pieces.

850
00:49:05,846 --> 00:49:08,730
Rym: So you can't make it stupidly complicated unless you're crazy.

851
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:09,010
Scott: Yeah.

852
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:11,093
Scott: Look at how complicated like Master of Orion is.

853
00:49:11,113 --> 00:49:12,436
Scott: And that's not even that complicated.

854
00:49:12,476 --> 00:49:13,197
Scott: But look at Eclipse.

855
00:49:13,497 --> 00:49:13,738
Rym: Yeah.

856
00:49:13,758 --> 00:49:18,786
Scott: Eclipse had to simplify so much versus Master of Orion to fit itself onto a board.

857
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,590
Scott: And it still has a gigantic board with a million pieces.

858
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:22,010
Scott: Yep.

859
00:49:22,511 --> 00:49:30,740
Rym: But writing rules and designing games in the same way, if you design tabletop games, it forces you to understand the core elements of games.

860
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:34,343
Rym: Whereas if you're designing a video game, you can do anything.

861
00:49:34,383 --> 00:49:40,510
Rym: And you might write a lot of code that does a lot of stuff in the game that doesn't actually have any documentation that the user can see.

862
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:40,910
Rym: Yeah.

863
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:44,054
Scott: And then look at something like, you know, the fancy, fancy war games.

864
00:49:44,115 --> 00:49:45,616
Scott: It's like, yeah, they're really complicated.

865
00:49:45,677 --> 00:49:48,420
Scott: Some, you know, advanced squad leader and whatnot.

866
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:55,830
Scott: But the way they get that across is lots of incomprehensible chits in a gigantic book and lots of paper and pencils and dice and stuff.

867
00:49:56,611 --> 00:49:57,132
Scott: And it's like.

868
00:49:57,152 --> 00:50:00,378
Scott: that's how they managed to fit that crazy complexity onto a board.

869
00:50:00,418 --> 00:50:02,622
Scott: game is a huge, huge book.

870
00:50:02,963 --> 00:50:03,163
Rym: Yeah.

871
00:50:03,203 --> 00:50:04,225
Scott: It's like, screw that shit.

872
00:50:04,406 --> 00:50:05,468
Rym: Amateur mistake.

873
00:50:05,508 --> 00:50:06,550
Scott: And no one got time for that.

874
00:50:07,311 --> 00:50:14,338
Rym: If you're writing tabletop rules, use examples in parallel to have the document that explains the game, but have a sidebar.

875
00:50:14,618 --> 00:50:18,222
Rym: that's just showing examples of every one of those concepts along the way.

876
00:50:18,883 --> 00:50:21,205
Rym: That'll save you so much trouble.

877
00:50:21,786 --> 00:50:25,730
Rym: And if you can't show succinct examples, again, your game's probably not that well designed.

878
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:28,053
Rym: Nope.

879
00:50:28,213 --> 00:50:29,114
Rym: We've gone on about an hour.

880
00:50:29,154 --> 00:50:29,775
Rym: I think that's enough.

881
00:50:30,115 --> 00:50:30,435
Rym: Okay.

882
00:50:30,596 --> 00:50:31,417
Rym: Write good rules.

883
00:50:31,837 --> 00:50:32,698
Rym: Read the rules.

884
00:50:33,078 --> 00:50:35,021
Rym: If a game has bad rules, don't play it.

885
00:50:36,022 --> 00:50:38,284
Rym: Don't mistake good game design for good theme.

886
00:50:39,386 --> 00:50:40,867
Rym: That's kind of an orthogonal decision.

887
00:50:41,468 --> 00:50:42,990
Rym: Learn what the word orthogonal means.

888
00:50:43,731 --> 00:50:43,851
Scott: Yeah.

889
00:50:43,871 --> 00:50:45,652
Scott: It's an important word in a lot of game rules.

890
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:47,214
Rym: Actually, you know, this is the final topic.

891
00:50:47,254 --> 00:50:57,043
Rym: So I have been on panels, and this came up at PAX Dev, at MAGFest, at PAX regulars, all over the place in private conversations.

892
00:50:57,443 --> 00:51:03,268
Rym: There is a war in the, like, how to write game rules and express them to players space.

893
00:51:03,348 --> 00:51:05,170
Rym: And there are two opposing philosophies.

894
00:51:05,671 --> 00:51:16,682
Rym: Philosophy number one is that you should use very precise language with jargon, explain the jargon, and educate your player base to get them to a higher level understanding.

895
00:51:16,742 --> 00:51:23,790
Rym: Like, everyone who plays tabletop games should eventually learn what the word orthogonal means and use it correctly in terms of movement on a grid.

896
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:33,750
Rym: The opposite school of thought is that you should always write your rules at a seventh grade level for accessibility purposes so that anyone can understand the game.

897
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:35,092
Scott: It depends on what game you're making.

898
00:51:35,112 --> 00:51:50,290
Scott: The advanced squad leader rulebook should probably just use the word orthogonal, and the rulebook for, I don't know, oshi, probably shouldn't say orthogonal in it, or if it should, it should teach you what the hell that means, because that might be played by someone who has never seen that word before in their entire life.

899
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:54,122
Rym: So that is what I think we should do, and that's where I fall on that, what you just said there.

900
00:51:54,142 --> 00:51:55,867
Rym: You should use the jargon words.

901
00:51:56,790 --> 00:52:01,626
Scott: Are you really going to say that the advanced squad leader rulebook needs to explain the meaning of the word orthogonal?

902
00:52:01,667 --> 00:52:02,489
Scott: Because I don't think so.

903
00:52:03,171 --> 00:52:10,399
Rym: You may want to have a glossary in the back, but at least for a mass market game, you should use the jargon to explain.

904
00:52:10,439 --> 00:52:12,361
Rym: Like, you should say it is a draft.

905
00:52:12,441 --> 00:52:16,807
Rym: You should use those terms, but your glossary should explain what those mean.

906
00:52:17,447 --> 00:52:19,730
Rym: so that, one, you're basically educating players.

907
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:25,443
Rym: If more people playing tabletop games know what the word orthogonal means, then we're all going to have a good time.

908
00:52:26,045 --> 00:52:28,230
Rym: It's going to be a lot easier to get people to learn games.

909
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:44,228
Scott: And if you want, you can always put, you know, the brief version of the rules on BoardGameGeek or something, and they'll just say the same exact rules, but simplified, so you can print them out on one sheet, like, "Oh yeah, draft five cards in a round robin, like Seven Wonders,".

910
00:52:44,268 --> 00:52:45,649
Scott: and then, you know, you don't need...

911
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:57,001
Rym: So along those lines, last amateur hour mistake, have a section that's usually on a single page by itself that explains all the numbers and fiddly bits you need to set up before a game.

912
00:52:57,041 --> 00:52:58,603
Rym: Like, how much money does everyone get?

913
00:52:58,903 --> 00:53:00,525
Rym: Wait, how many cards do we draw at the start?

914
00:53:01,086 --> 00:53:04,970
Rym: Yeah, I can't express to you how hard it is to figure that out for most tabletop games.

915
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:07,022
Scott: We're looking at it every time for Bonanza.

916
00:53:07,042 --> 00:53:08,090
Scott: How many cards do we start with?

917
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:11,029
Rym: I just wrote it in permanent marker on the inside of the box.

918
00:53:12,473 --> 00:53:12,726
Scott: Good idea.

919
00:53:17,201 --> 00:53:19,447
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

920
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:24,480
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

921
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,900
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

922
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,827
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

923
00:53:32,967 --> 00:53:37,540
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

924
00:53:37,901 --> 00:53:41,076
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

925
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,430
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

926
00:53:45,631 --> 00:53:48,520
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

927
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:20,839
Rym: And as promised, because I said in the Patreon quote, "This is super dumb, but if you support us this much, Rym, we'll say your name at the end of each episode after the credits, along with some ultra dumb stinger

928
00:54:20,879 --> 00:54:21,360
Rym: content.".

929
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,528
Rym: We're talking Rims.

930
00:54:23,253 --> 00:54:24,280
Rym: YouTube likes dumb.

931
00:54:25,082 --> 00:54:33,280
Rym: So, without further ado, in order of the amount of money that you're getting to us on a monthly basis, one person is definitely gaming this system, which is beautiful.

932
00:54:34,380 --> 00:55:05,140
Rym: Rebecca Dunn, Nicholas Barlow, James David White, Christian Kuntz, Jessica L. Barlow, Mechanical Mind, Brian Cedroni, Rochelle Mantanona, Finn Eric Solvarod, Rym eats Poop, Edgar Mendez, William Eisenroze, Chris Midd... I drop my microphone, Chris Knox, Flame Darkfire, Samuel Cordery, Daniel Redman, Chris Haddad, Doug Snyder, Sean Klein, Chris Reimer, and Thomas Hahn.

933
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:14,160
Rym: I can't express to you how stressful it is to try to read a whole bunch of people's names in a row and not really butcher the pronunciation.

934
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:20,920
Rym: And now I present to you the opposite of A Moment of Zen, the thing that I just do at the end of all these episodes.

935
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,128
Scott: All of the food in Toronto is made of edible oil products.

936
00:55:24,409 --> 00:55:26,053
Scott: They don't have bagels in Toronto.

937
00:55:26,233 --> 00:55:27,075
Scott: They have donuts.

938
00:55:27,476 --> 00:55:28,980
Scott: Donuts made of edible oil.

939
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,445
Rym: I don't like donuts.

940
00:55:30,686 --> 00:55:31,932
Rym: They don't have bagels.

941
00:55:32,193 --> 00:55:33,600
Scott: I don't want to go to Toronto.

942
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:36,006
Scott: People don't have faces in Toronto.

943
00:55:36,187 --> 00:55:38,094
Scott: They have cigarette ads instead.

944
00:55:38,254 --> 00:55:39,800
Rym: They listen to your phone calls.

945
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,860
Scott: There's a tower in Toronto that controls people's minds.

946
00:55:44,622 --> 00:55:47,773
Scott: It's illegal to possess brightly coloured balloons in Toronto.

947
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:50,060
Rym: Illegal to own brightly coloured balloons.

948
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:53,210
Scott: All of the children in Toronto must wear suits.

949
00:55:53,612 --> 00:55:54,395
Scott: Even the girls.

950
00:55:54,556 --> 00:55:55,600
Rym: Three-piece suits.

951
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,212
Rym: The buildings in Toronto have no windows.

952
00:55:58,574 --> 00:55:59,560
Scott: I don't want to go.

953
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:04,580
Scott: Everyone lives in subterranean caverns filled with donuts made of edible oil.
