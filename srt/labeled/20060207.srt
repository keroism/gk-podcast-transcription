1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,415
Scott: It's Tuesday February 7th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:16,623
Scott: We talk about fear and Through the desert.

3
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:17,946
Scott: let's do this.

4
00:00:18,407 --> 00:00:19,591
Scott: so today was yet another.

5
00:00:20,072 --> 00:00:23,770
Scott: go to work and do not so much day I don't know.

6
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:24,339
Rym: I had a good day.

7
00:00:24,902 --> 00:00:33,820
Scott: I went and I actually took a wrong turn and I went around in a circle a little bit and then I got to work, and they didn't do much, and okay, okay?

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,640
Rym: So if you didn't do anything then why you bother and telling everyone out there that you didn't do anything?

9
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:39,094
Scott: I did some stuff.

10
00:00:39,316 --> 00:00:41,166
Rym: Yeah You said you didn't.

11
00:00:41,186 --> 00:00:42,535
Rym: you said today was just a boring crap day.

12
00:00:42,555 --> 00:00:43,220
Rym: Why even bring it up?

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,359
Rym: Why not just get right into the news?

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,554
Scott: Because that's what you're saying before we started.

15
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:50,838
Rym: now before we started I said let's get into the news since you obviously don't have any.

16
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,382
Rym: yeah Mmm.

17
00:00:52,604 --> 00:00:55,159
Scott: You said let's get in the news, and I didn't want it cuz we never do that.

18
00:00:55,662 --> 00:00:57,770
Rym: Yeah, but you didn't have anything to say before the news.

19
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,259
Scott: I was gonna talk about how boring it was.

20
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,728
Scott: Okay It was real boring.

21
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:05,319
Rym: Yeah great anyway.

22
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:17,611
Scott: So um While I was being bored at work Apple decided to release the awaited and rumored Nano that only has one gigabyte of space.

23
00:01:17,732 --> 00:01:19,860
Rym: great, so they released a crappier Nano.

24
00:01:20,462 --> 00:01:23,570
Scott: Well the thing is is only 150 bucks, so if you're poor wait a minute.

25
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,235
Scott: 150 bucks for a one gigabyte Nano.

26
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:29,207
Rym: Yep, how much is it for the bigger one?

27
00:01:29,388 --> 00:01:34,022
Scott: the 2 gig is 200 and the 4 gig is 250.

28
00:01:34,022 --> 00:01:41,030
Rym: All right, I mean I I love music and I like little mp3 players But I just really don't see any of those being worth that much money.

29
00:01:41,492 --> 00:01:48,740
Scott: Well the 1 gig shuffle was a hundred But now the 1 gig shuffle has been discounted because the 1 gig Nano exists.

30
00:01:49,402 --> 00:01:51,931
Scott: So if you really wanted a 1 gig shuffle now's the time.

31
00:01:51,951 --> 00:01:54,640
Scott: yeah, I don't really see the point of the shuffle.

32
00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:56,890
Scott: I mean you don't know what you're gonna listen to.

33
00:01:57,634 --> 00:01:58,980
Rym: I guess the point of it was that it's cheap.

34
00:01:59,381 --> 00:02:04,980
Scott: Yeah, but I mean if you're a podcast listener that doesn't really help because you can't select episodes or anything.

35
00:02:05,062 --> 00:02:05,680
Scott: I guess it's good.

36
00:02:05,741 --> 00:02:09,847
Scott: If you have just a lot of music that you want to put on shuffle Then I guess the shuffle works.

37
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:12,440
Scott: or if you're exercising it doesn't weigh anything.

38
00:02:12,561 --> 00:02:14,677
Scott: You don't care if you drop it, so I guess it's good for that, too.

39
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:18,357
Rym: Yeah, they usually when I exercise I watch TV like an anime or something.

40
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,700
Scott: well What if you're like you know running around the hills and if I'm running I don't want to have music with me.

41
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,003
Rym: I want to enjoy where I am Whatever.

42
00:02:26,023 --> 00:02:28,270
Scott: a lot of people run around with music on.

43
00:02:28,672 --> 00:02:30,277
Rym: yeah, I just find that kind of plus.

44
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:32,826
Rym: if you get all sweaty I mean you can't really wear normal headphones.

45
00:02:32,846 --> 00:02:33,629
Rym: They're big and heavy.

46
00:02:34,031 --> 00:02:35,115
Rym: if you wear earplugs.

47
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,640
Rym: They'll just get all sweaty and nasty.

48
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,084
Rym: There's really no easy way.

49
00:02:38,104 --> 00:02:40,451
Scott: I don't know the ones I have be alright.

50
00:02:41,013 --> 00:02:43,380
Rym: Yeah, let's see you wear those and work up a good sweat.

51
00:02:44,105 --> 00:02:44,595
Scott: Yeah, why not?

52
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:47,359
Rym: All right, try it someday.

53
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:48,925
Scott: Well, what do you think will happen?

54
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:53,620
Rym: it gets all yeah as those sweat pools around the outside of the plug and start seeping in.

55
00:02:55,101 --> 00:02:56,866
Scott: I don't know about you my ears.

56
00:02:56,906 --> 00:03:00,057
Rym: Don't collect sweat in them, and you've never had a good workout.

57
00:03:00,077 --> 00:03:04,980
Scott: I Think you just got some problems with your ears sweat glands.

58
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:10,540
Rym: If I go out for an hour run by the time I come back I pretty much look like I've been running in a rainstorm.

59
00:03:11,881 --> 00:03:14,208
Scott: Anyway, so there's one gig nano.

60
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:22,180
Scott: um I guess it does everything my nano does and you know I actually I checked and I don't really have more than a gig of stuff on my four gig nano.

61
00:03:23,091 --> 00:03:28,332
Rym: But Yeah, if I can get a nano for less than a hundred bucks That's when I'm gonna jump ship and buy an iPod.

62
00:03:28,694 --> 00:03:29,580
Scott: I don't think that's gonna happen.

63
00:03:29,962 --> 00:03:32,259
Rym: I don't think I'm gonna buy an iPod and don't get one.

64
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:37,169
Scott: You can get one of those other Brands that make things that aren't as good.

65
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:44,804
Rym: see the thing is honestly as much as I listen to music I really have no need for a small portable music player Mmm.

66
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:46,279
Rym: I mean I listen to music in my car.

67
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:49,374
Rym: I listen to music in my computer room, and I listen to music in the house.

68
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,580
Rym: and when I'm out I'm really only out doing things.

69
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:53,403
Rym: I really never.

70
00:03:53,423 --> 00:03:58,485
Rym: I mean I can't listen to music so much at work since I'm doing a lot of tech support or walking around The line talking to people.

71
00:03:59,249 --> 00:04:00,575
Scott: no I listen to music at work.

72
00:04:01,037 --> 00:04:01,680
Rym: Yeah, you're a coder.

73
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,785
Rym: You just sit there and code.

74
00:04:02,805 --> 00:04:04,110
Scott: listen to music in the car.

75
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,580
Scott: I listen to music between work in the car.

76
00:04:07,501 --> 00:04:09,087
Scott: Listen to music on the train.

77
00:04:09,147 --> 00:04:11,597
Rym: when you listen to music between you don't ride the train anymore.

78
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:14,509
Scott: No when I did Yeah, but you don't anymore listen to music.

79
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,574
Scott: You know whenever.

80
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:20,406
Rym: if I had a train ride I guess whenever and if I had a train ride or something I'd probably definitely have an iPod.

81
00:04:20,446 --> 00:04:23,560
Scott: you think that I could use the iPod in your car with your broken CD player.

82
00:04:24,247 --> 00:04:27,908
Scott: I'll just play CDs In your broken CD player now.

83
00:04:27,928 --> 00:04:28,349
Rym: I fixed it.

84
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:30,558
Scott: Yeah, that's not what happened last time.

85
00:04:30,598 --> 00:04:31,200
Scott: We were in the car.

86
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:33,059
Rym: I worked just fine.

87
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:35,809
Rym: The only thing is that doesn't work when it's really humid out.

88
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:39,040
Rym: the iPod works in all weathers, and you know it was really humid.

89
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:41,259
Rym: Honestly, I'll just listen to NPR cuz that's free.

90
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:47,566
Scott: Yeah, I mostly download NPR so I don't to listen all the stupid ads Except for the see.

91
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:50,337
Rym: when there's ads I switch to the other NPR station.

92
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:51,140
Rym: That's on a different schedule.

93
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,970
Scott: Yeah, I had two MPRs in the same place.

94
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:54,633
Rym: Yeah, well.

95
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:55,617
Rym: It's weird this area.

96
00:04:55,637 --> 00:04:56,280
Rym: We live in an area.

97
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:04,857
Rym: There's a lot of mountains so radio stations come and go crazily And I actually lose an NPR station on my way to work and have to switch to another one anyway.

98
00:05:04,877 --> 00:05:07,447
Rym: Yeah Wow, it's good even though.

99
00:05:07,468 --> 00:05:09,195
Rym: I honestly I drive five minutes to work.

100
00:05:09,255 --> 00:05:10,200
Rym: I live right there.

101
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,753
Scott: Yeah, but see that's what iPods are all about.

102
00:05:12,773 --> 00:05:14,060
Scott: is you just download it listen to it.

103
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,131
Scott: You don't have to worry about fiddling with stations or anything.

104
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:17,960
Rym: Yeah, I guess it's just not worth the money to me.

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,751
Rym: I'm kind of a cheapskate that I just I'm not that Interested in a lot of these expensive gadgets.

106
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:26,250
Rym: I mean I like them and if I had them for free I'd use them left and right, but I've been.

107
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,477
Scott: you change your mind every day.

108
00:05:27,497 --> 00:05:30,348
Scott: one day You're like yeah I'm getting an anno as soon as I get this money.

109
00:05:30,388 --> 00:05:33,020
Scott: see I saw that and then and then you're like I'm not getting one.

110
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,805
Scott: It's too expensive.

111
00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:35,959
Scott: They don't like I'm totally getting one real soon.

112
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:39,619
Rym: Yeah, I point out that I've stayed constant and that oftentimes I think oh I'd really like one.

113
00:05:39,901 --> 00:05:45,188
Rym: But then when it comes down to like a go to the site and I go to buy it and then I like oh yeah Cost that much money for that much money.

114
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:48,260
Rym: I can go to another con, and then I go to the con instead.

115
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,458
Scott: Why don't you go to the con and?

116
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:57,332
Rym: Get the Nana which is what I do because instead of spending my extra income on gadgets I'm dumping it all into my student loans, and they're going away real quick.

117
00:05:57,894 --> 00:05:58,636
Scott: I could do that, too.

118
00:06:00,364 --> 00:06:02,374
Rym: You know you make less money than me plus.

119
00:06:02,394 --> 00:06:03,580
Rym: You don't really go to so many cons.

120
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:07,219
Rym: I guess I have more expenses of that regard and it's not that much money.

121
00:06:08,842 --> 00:06:12,012
Rym: Set me back over 300 bucks at least as far as I'm concerned.

122
00:06:12,092 --> 00:06:14,360
Scott: anything less than $500 at this point is just blue.

123
00:06:14,884 --> 00:06:16,860
Rym: Then give me four hundred ninety nine dollars now.

124
00:06:17,603 --> 00:06:24,432
Scott: Yeah, I just I just make a lot of money now, and it seems that you know at the beginning I was being all frugal like a college guy was you know?

125
00:06:24,532 --> 00:06:35,193
Scott: and I had piles and piles of money Just piling up, and I was like you know what I can buy stuff, and I even though I buy stuff I still manage to pay everything and still have money left over.

126
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:42,679
Rym: see I don't buy stuff so much But I spend a lot of money on Travels and eating out and events and various lots of money on travels and eating out.

127
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:43,883
Rym: no I really you don't.

128
00:06:44,224 --> 00:06:44,967
Scott: yeah, I do.

129
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:50,608
Rym: I mean I'll point out that when I was living out here alone before you moved out Pretty much every weekend.

130
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:53,483
Rym: I drove many hours to various places I spent.

131
00:06:53,864 --> 00:06:59,442
Rym: I spend more money on conventions and food than I do and I think anything else in my life except all my student loans.

132
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:03,098
Scott: I spent just as much money on outside food as you do if not more.

133
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:05,465
Rym: I Highly doubt that.

134
00:07:05,606 --> 00:07:08,156
Scott: and then you only go to like two or three conventions.

135
00:07:08,217 --> 00:07:08,779
Scott: I don't go to.

136
00:07:09,522 --> 00:07:10,908
Rym: Yeah, you know let's see Katsu cons gonna.

Rym: all right all right That's already a lot of money right there 800 bucks.

142
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:21,560
Scott: It's not even a thousand dollars.

Rym: yeah, I'm also at a car.

148
00:07:31,974 --> 00:07:33,140
Scott: I went to those cons.

149
00:07:33,882 --> 00:07:35,408
Scott: I would still have thousands of dollars left.

150
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,059
Rym: all right fine, and then be happy in your money bags.

151
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:39,305
Scott: richness I am.

152
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:42,120
Rym: I mean I make more money than you, but I also spend more money than you.

153
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,707
Scott: I don't know what the hell you're spending it on.

154
00:07:43,727 --> 00:07:45,858
Scott: that's that's the real just amazing thing.

155
00:07:45,978 --> 00:07:47,728
Rym: mostly I spend it on my loans.

156
00:07:48,432 --> 00:07:49,739
Scott: I spend money on my loans, too.

157
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:53,593
Rym: I put almost a thousand dollars every month into my various student loans.

158
00:07:53,894 --> 00:07:55,500
Scott: I could do that, and I'd still be okay.

159
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:58,153
Rym: Yeah, you know what I'm doing that now, and then all my extra money.

160
00:07:58,194 --> 00:07:59,018
Rym: I spent on other stuff.

161
00:08:00,301 --> 00:08:01,406
Scott: Why the hell you're buying.

162
00:08:01,466 --> 00:08:05,465
Scott: you must be getting ripped off by someone or maybe you have a secret mafia payment You're making.

163
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:05,990
Scott: I don't know.

164
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,080
Scott: it must be.

165
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:08,700
Scott: anyway.

166
00:08:09,862 --> 00:08:10,565
Scott: What else happened today?

167
00:08:10,585 --> 00:08:10,685
Scott: Well?

168
00:08:10,706 --> 00:08:13,760
Rym: I'm also subsidizing your ass in the rent for the past seven months.

169
00:08:14,162 --> 00:08:16,072
Scott: It's like chump change 200 bucks.

170
00:08:16,434 --> 00:08:19,548
Scott: whatever it adds up It doesn't add up very quickly.

171
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:21,960
Rym: you owe me almost a thousand dollars if I wanted that back.

172
00:08:22,462 --> 00:08:23,105
Scott: It's like nothing.

173
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:26,360
Rym: all right think of me a thousand dollars not a chance, but you just said it was nothing.

174
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,646
Scott: Yeah, I'm still not gonna.

175
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:28,028
Scott: Give it to you.

176
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:28,369
Rym: Why not.

177
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,414
Scott: It's nothing you don't care because if you're cheap bastard I'm gonna be one, too.

178
00:08:33,461 --> 00:08:41,654
Rym: It's just that I really often don't see the benefit At least for the money like I'd love a laptop But it's not worth the money would take to get a laptop that I would like.

179
00:08:41,674 --> 00:08:43,020
Scott: I Don't know.

180
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:48,293
Scott: a lot of times though you you know you don't see the benefit of things And then you get him and then you're like oh my god.

181
00:08:48,313 --> 00:08:49,300
Scott: This is the greatest thing ever.

182
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,467
Rym: Oh, yeah, if I get something.

183
00:08:50,849 --> 00:08:52,197
Rym: I mean if I just had a laptop now.

184
00:08:52,217 --> 00:08:52,680
Rym: It'd be awesome.

185
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,659
Rym: I use it forever, but it's not worth the money to get one.

186
00:08:56,501 --> 00:09:00,720
Rym: I mean, I really want a MacBook and I was almost thinking about buying one.

187
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:06,480
Rym: But I decided against that because I'd rather go places and do a bunch of stuff with that money, or you can do both.

188
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,250
Rym: No, not really because I want to pay off my debt.

189
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,180
Rym: I'm not gonna put less money into my student loans.

190
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,986
Rym: I want those gone as soon as possible.

191
00:09:13,026 --> 00:09:14,089
Scott: You can do all three.

192
00:09:14,109 --> 00:09:16,096
Rym: see about all right.

193
00:09:16,678 --> 00:09:16,858
Rym: No.

194
00:09:16,898 --> 00:09:17,380
Rym: I really can't.

195
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,604
Scott: What the hell is your money going?

196
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:21,289
Scott: Oh my god, okay?

197
00:09:22,192 --> 00:09:23,476
Scott: I can pay for this car.

198
00:09:23,656 --> 00:09:27,119
Scott: Oh, I just don't get it To check your accounting sometime.

199
00:09:28,121 --> 00:09:28,683
Scott: Money's going.

200
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:31,416
Rym: see keep in mind that I have many different student loans.

201
00:09:31,436 --> 00:09:32,280
Rym: You just have that one.

202
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,527
Scott: Yeah, it's a big one.

203
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,312
Rym: Yeah.

204
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:39,235
Scott: I have that one, but I Think it's like bigger than my car loan.

205
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:40,120
Scott: It's twice as long.

206
00:09:41,042 --> 00:09:43,780
Rym: I mean let's say I put like 800 bucks a month into my student loans.

207
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,848
Rym: I put 250 month into my car payment.

208
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,879
Rym: I put about a hundred and fifty a month into car insurance.

209
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:51,618
Rym: I Put about 600 a month into rent.

210
00:09:52,621 --> 00:09:53,344
Rym: The money adds up.

211
00:09:53,585 --> 00:09:57,340
Rym: plus I pay more taxes because I've been working here for a long time.

212
00:09:57,441 --> 00:10:06,999
Rym: So I mean these last two years I've paid the full taxes as though I made all that money and since I'm not a student anymore I paid over 10 grand in taxes this year, and I'm not gonna get much of it back.

213
00:10:07,644 --> 00:10:22,920
Scott: Oh, maybe I paid almost 10 grand in taxes And I'm not gonna get my stupid New York State taxes back those bastards, but I think I'm gonna get my like many 5g's I think of federal taxes back Which should be nice because that cancels my car down payment, which is why I made a $5,000 down payment on the car.

214
00:10:23,902 --> 00:10:25,348
Scott: That was my logic right there.

215
00:10:25,368 --> 00:10:27,175
Scott: Yeah, just get it right back.

216
00:10:27,457 --> 00:10:30,688
Scott: I should do those taxes All right.

217
00:10:31,356 --> 00:10:34,809
Rym: um Yeah, so to get off that tangent Nintendo.

218
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:40,082
Rym: There's a nice little interview here on Forbes with Perrin Kaplan.

219
00:10:41,604 --> 00:10:47,029
Scott: she's probably the VP of something At the end of something.

220
00:10:47,991 --> 00:10:52,485
Rym: Perrin Kaplan the vice president of marketing and corporate affairs for Nintendo Nintendo

221
00:10:52,565 --> 00:10:53,869
Scott: Europe Nintendo Japan Nintendo

222
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:54,230
Rym: America

223
00:10:54,812 --> 00:10:54,873
Scott: The

224
00:10:54,913 --> 00:10:57,021
Rym: only one that really matters here for us at least

225
00:10:57,202 --> 00:10:57,503
Scott: yeah,

226
00:10:58,126 --> 00:11:05,948
Rym: and they're just talking about Nintendo's blue ocean strategy, and how a lot of analysts say they're gonna blow Microsoft and Sony out of the water.

227
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,236
Scott: yeah Well, it's just basically.

228
00:11:08,396 --> 00:11:18,730
Rym: you know the it seems to be having every market these days But you see forward claim that they were a blue ocean Company and they kind of fucked themselves.

229
00:11:19,372 --> 00:11:36,990
Scott: Yeah, if you don't get it blue ocean means it's sort of like an analogy pertaining to pioneering and exploring in that It's currently an ocean where all the customers are and people are fighting in that ocean to Over which customers go to who and that's the red ocean because it's filled with the blood of battle.

230
00:11:37,372 --> 00:11:37,655
Rym: Well, it's.

231
00:11:37,715 --> 00:11:39,650
Rym: the blue ocean is a finite resource.

232
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,329
Rym: There's a finite number of people in it and a finite number of resources to spend.

233
00:11:43,671 --> 00:11:53,850
Scott: Yeah, the idea of blue ocean is that there's a bunch of people who aren't in any one's you know customer And you would go over and say I'm not fighting with you guys anymore over this red ocean.

234
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:56,826
Scott: I'm gonna go sail into this brand new blue ocean over there.

235
00:11:57,108 --> 00:11:57,469
Scott: That's now.

236
00:11:58,433 --> 00:12:00,200
Rym: Specifically is that Nintendo.

237
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:13,365
Rym: I mean currently there's a market of gamers and gamers as defined by Microsoft and Sony and there's a limited number of them and You can only get so many of them from the pie and so many is just pretty much winning that.

238
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:13,846
Rym: but war.

239
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:22,350
Scott: it is a demographic primarily consisting of teenage boys who like FPS's and Grand Theft Auto's and racing games and sports games.

240
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:31,174
Rym: So Nintendo is trying to go into different waters and get people who aren't currently in that market into the market and into the Market under Nintendo's name.

241
00:12:31,555 --> 00:12:39,570
Scott: Yeah, which basically says alright, we obviously can't make games to Get all those guys to buy Nintendo games instead of Sony games.

242
00:12:39,951 --> 00:12:45,408
Scott: Let's get all these other people mommies and kids and dads and grandpas and casual

243
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:45,850
Rym: gamers

244
00:12:46,251 --> 00:12:54,971
Scott: everyone else in the world to buy Nintendo games and that way the only customers that Sony and Microsoft will have will be teenage boys and Like

245
00:12:56,054 --> 00:12:57,398
Rym: and it seems to be working really well.

246
00:12:57,438 --> 00:13:01,250
Rym: They talk here about how the DS is basically kick the PSP's ass.

247
00:13:01,775 --> 00:13:05,256
Scott: Yeah, the DS is just You know beating the shit.

248
00:13:05,296 --> 00:13:09,869
Scott: the DS is so crazy in Japan that they're re importing them from the u.s.

249
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:19,179
Rym: They sold 13 million DS units last year and all of Nintendo's portals combined have 82% of the portable Software sales market.

250
00:13:19,621 --> 00:13:21,109
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty nuts.

251
00:13:22,013 --> 00:13:27,333
Rym: Yeah, 82% of game consoles out there that are portable are Nintendo Mm-hmm.

252
00:13:27,654 --> 00:13:30,023
Scott: It's mostly GBA which is like 50 plus percent.

253
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:38,304
Rym: Yeah, though the DS is coming in strong Yes is coming in very strong And also the PSP even though it has sold fairly well in the u.s.

254
00:13:38,805 --> 00:13:40,668
Rym: None of the games forward have sold at all Really?

255
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:53,070
Scott: Yeah, cuz it's it's being purchased and they count it in terms of market share in terms of who has the most, you know Video game portable hardware is out there and you look at the numbers and there's a bunch of PSP's out there.

256
00:13:53,695 --> 00:13:55,410
Scott: But they're not really being used to play games.

257
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:00,270
Scott: They're being used to play ROMs and to UMD movies and downloaded movies and that sort of thing.

258
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,013
Rym: Yeah, how's that?

259
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,081
Rym: Most people buy a DS and play Nintendo games.

260
00:14:03,402 --> 00:14:05,530
Rym: Everyone else buys a PSP to play Nintendo games.

261
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,058
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty hilarious.

262
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:09,343
Rym: The other thing is that Nintendo.

263
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:16,010
Rym: this is kind of an interesting distinction But it's kind of like the difference between how Otakon reports its attendance and how anime Expo reports its attendance.

264
00:14:16,712 --> 00:14:23,170
Rym: But Sony reports every unit that is sold or shipped to a distributor or to a retail outlet.

265
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,539
Rym: Nintendo counts things that are sold to a customer.

266
00:14:27,282 --> 00:14:32,676
Scott: Well, that's just old, you know company Accounting numbering talk.

267
00:14:32,856 --> 00:14:41,759
Scott: Yeah, you know if you're winning you always report, you know The most impressive number that you can report, you know that makes it still look like you're winning.

268
00:14:42,221 --> 00:14:48,668
Scott: and if you're losing you Report the most impressive number that you can report to make it look like you're not losing by that much.

269
00:14:48,828 --> 00:14:55,546
Rym: true though Nintendo has always made a point of reporting that number at least even when they were losing with the Like the GameCube when they were in second place.

270
00:14:55,586 --> 00:14:58,478
Rym: by far They didn't try to pretend they were doing better than they were.

271
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,210
Scott: well because the number that they were showing was still you know It was accurate enough.

272
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:11,750
Scott: If that number I guarantee you if the number of GameCube sold was like one and the number of GameCube sold to stores was A million they wouldn't be saying we've sold one GameCube.

273
00:15:12,071 --> 00:15:17,030
Rym: I don't know if they seem to stand by that that practice of only reporting direct sales.

274
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,903
Scott: They would be like a million GameCube shipped.

275
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:19,970
Scott: That's what they would be doing.

276
00:15:20,492 --> 00:15:25,770
Rym: Anyway, but Sony very specifically just kind of backs off this and doesn't say where their numbers come from.

277
00:15:26,132 --> 00:15:28,930
Scott: Companies keep a lot of secrets that are all weird for no reason.

278
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:36,014
Scott: I mean if you try to ask anyone from Gillette how long the razor blades should go before there's changed They'll never tell you.

279
00:15:36,094 --> 00:15:38,644
Rym: Oh, I know the answer about two shaves.

280
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,230
Rym: Those things are such pieces of crap.

281
00:15:40,451 --> 00:15:42,284
Scott: Oh my god, actually a lot of people are.

282
00:15:42,305 --> 00:15:44,456
Scott: there's a big Conspiracy going around the net.

283
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:45,842
Scott: people like you never have to change them.

284
00:15:45,883 --> 00:15:47,490
Scott: You can buy a Mach 3 and use it for a year.

285
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:47,851
Rym: What?

286
00:15:48,112 --> 00:15:50,138
Scott: no you can't I know I don't know what these people.

287
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:53,910
Scott: they must be shaving themselves with like just flat pieces of metal.

288
00:15:54,031 --> 00:15:54,754
Scott: I don't know what the hell.

289
00:15:55,096 --> 00:15:59,297
Rym: I mean, these are probably the same people who say if you put acetone in your gas tank You'll get better gas mileage.

290
00:15:59,378 --> 00:16:01,450
Scott: Yeah and explode your gas tank.

291
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:05,910
Rym: Actually, no, it probably won't cause any damage other than maybe to your catalytic converter.

292
00:16:06,393 --> 00:16:07,984
Scott: Yeah, you don't want to mess that up though.

293
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:23,850
Scott: You can get in trouble Only if you're in a state that has emissions testing, you know My car actually has this emissions equipment because New York has evil testing Every all the exhaust goes through my catalytic converter two times before it leaves the car.

294
00:16:24,638 --> 00:16:25,049
Scott: It's crazy.

295
00:16:25,493 --> 00:16:37,259
Rym: That's probably a good thing because the county we live in has been trying to have Admissions testing as part of its inspection for a long time and I'm kind of for it because it'll really screw all those frickin rice Boys with their giant loud fart pipes.

296
00:16:37,961 --> 00:16:46,745
Scott: Oh, yeah, but I always seem to drive by our house late at night If you have a fart pipe or and thank you You should totally be busted but I mean running it through twice.

297
00:16:46,886 --> 00:16:48,030
Scott: It's like alright, what is that?

298
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,256
Scott: How much does it really buy you?

299
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:50,603
Scott: I don't know.

300
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:51,850
Rym: Well, how much does it hurt you?

301
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,022
Rym: There's what six horsepower something like that.

302
00:16:55,062 --> 00:16:55,685
Scott: Yeah, great.

303
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:56,510
Rym: It's probably worth it.

304
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,640
Rym: Safety I see the thing is six or seven horsepower.

305
00:17:00,961 --> 00:17:06,078
Rym: unless you took the car on a track and did many many laps You do there's no way you can even begin to notice that.

306
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,845
Scott: no, I don't really notice anything.

307
00:17:07,865 --> 00:17:13,410
Scott: the car goes fine But you know, the emissions doesn't really benefit me in any way whatsoever.

308
00:17:14,391 --> 00:17:16,900
Rym: Does you know environment pollution etc?

309
00:17:17,262 --> 00:17:18,265
Scott: All the things I don't care about.

310
00:17:18,546 --> 00:17:27,950
Rym: Yeah Yeah, so things of the day.

311
00:17:28,694 --> 00:17:40,043
Rym: Well when I was in high school for any of you who don't know me I was real big into marching bands and drum cores and there was a time when I considered pursuing it professionally instead of going into IT Bando.

312
00:17:40,991 --> 00:17:41,674
Rym: Yeah, what do you want?

313
00:17:41,734 --> 00:17:43,259
Rym: I mean the band I marched in.

314
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:47,213
Rym: we put over 200 people on the field and we were fairly well Renowned.

315
00:17:47,253 --> 00:17:48,985
Rym: we used to travel all over the country competing.

316
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:49,609
Rym: It was a lot of fun.

317
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:54,750
Scott: Yeah, you know bragging about your high school marching band is something that most people look down upon.

318
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:55,890
Rym: Hey, it was fun.

319
00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:01,472
Rym: I would say that the band I was in in high school was pretty much the all I cared about from high school Everything.

320
00:18:01,492 --> 00:18:02,255
Rym: I got out of high school.

321
00:18:02,295 --> 00:18:03,158
Rym: I got out of that band.

322
00:18:03,238 --> 00:18:04,563
Scott: Just keep on insulting yourself.

323
00:18:05,065 --> 00:18:05,547
Rym: Yeah, whatever.

324
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:06,169
Rym: I had a good time.

325
00:18:06,491 --> 00:18:07,414
Scott: It's a sad.

326
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:10,667
Scott: the band in my high school was the greatest.

327
00:18:10,788 --> 00:18:16,392
Scott: Oh my god It's like you see a guy doing that and you're like roll in your eyes Whatever.

328
00:18:16,472 --> 00:18:17,194
Rym: I had a good time.

329
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:18,218
Rym: band camp was fun.

330
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:20,725
Scott: Yeah, and no matter what it was for you.

331
00:18:20,906 --> 00:18:33,929
Rym: Everyone else looks at it like My school was kind of weird and that honestly people really didn't care about the football team or anything and They'd come and watch the halftime show and then everyone would leave and then the football team would lose.

332
00:18:34,471 --> 00:18:40,518
Scott: Yeah, our school had a band too and there are plenty of people who were into it and everyone else was like Oh those freaking bandos.

333
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:41,964
Scott: They're all freaking me.

334
00:18:41,985 --> 00:18:43,756
Rym: Yeah It was fun.

335
00:18:43,777 --> 00:18:46,618
Rym: I had to go March in the Citrus Bowl and all that crap.

336
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,850
Scott: But anyway, they all did really into it.

337
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:57,243
Rym: I used to go watch marching band competitions like the actual drum cores and My thing of the day is a nice Google video compilation of some of the cooler.

338
00:18:57,644 --> 00:19:01,032
Rym: I guess sets that people have done over the years Mm-hmm.

339
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:08,179
Rym: So if you've never seen marching bands like real marching bands Not like a high school marching band But like a professional marching band doing its thing.

340
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:11,070
Rym: at least give these videos a look because it's really interesting.

341
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,905
Scott: I think it's a neat sport and it really it's not a sport.

342
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:19,182
Rym: first of all, actually It's very much a physical competitive sport and there are competitions all over the country.

343
00:19:19,904 --> 00:19:20,767
Scott: No, it's not.

344
00:19:21,047 --> 00:19:21,810
Scott: I don't consider it.

345
00:19:22,971 --> 00:19:23,774
Rym: It's a competition.

346
00:19:24,135 --> 00:19:25,019
Scott: It is a competition.

347
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:25,661
Rym: It's a sport.

348
00:19:25,781 --> 00:19:29,494
Rym: in so in as far as say figure skating is a sport Yeah That's how I'm gonna say.

349
00:19:29,514 --> 00:19:36,302
Scott: is it's more like figure skating and less like football because it's more like a subjective thing with the scoring It's not so much a points getting thing.

350
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:37,690
Rym: Yeah, but I still say it's a sport.

351
00:19:38,073 --> 00:19:39,626
Scott: I don't even think figure skating is a sport.

352
00:19:39,687 --> 00:19:47,949
Scott: for me Sports are games has to be a game where if there is also an athletic component That's what a sport is to me.

353
00:19:48,111 --> 00:19:51,756
Scott: Anyway, that's that's my because you know Everyone likes to have arguments over.

354
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,222
Scott: that's a sport and that's not.

355
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:55,698
Scott: and that is and that isn't you know, and all that bullshit Wait a minute.

356
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:57,513
Rym: So, uh Nanofictionary.

357
00:19:57,795 --> 00:20:04,361
Rym: it say there's a game where the only Determining factor and who wins is a subjective judgment by external people.

358
00:20:04,641 --> 00:20:05,263
Scott: It's not a game.

359
00:20:05,725 --> 00:20:07,109
Rym: So nanofictionary isn't a game?

360
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,684
Scott: Not really, oh, okay.

361
00:20:09,845 --> 00:20:10,590
Scott: It's not a game.

362
00:20:11,255 --> 00:20:12,323
Scott: See, that's the thing in.

363
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:17,775
Scott: in the dictionary There are multiple definitions for the word game as there are for many words, you know There's game one game two game three.

364
00:20:18,438 --> 00:20:20,606
Scott: when I say game in this context.

365
00:20:20,706 --> 00:20:26,643
Scott: Anyway, I mean the game Definition that talks about like, you know competition winning and losing and all that.

366
00:20:26,904 --> 00:20:28,730
Scott: There's another definition for game.

367
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:33,162
Scott: That's pretty much just means fun thing you do, you know, it's like.

368
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:34,746
Scott: oh a fun pastime.

369
00:20:34,786 --> 00:20:37,333
Scott: an activity of enjoyment You know is a game.

370
00:20:38,095 --> 00:20:41,724
Scott: and in terms of activity of enjoyment sure nanofictionary is a game.

371
00:20:41,845 --> 00:20:55,168
Scott: but in terms of like, you know a serious competition of Luck skill or ability or whatever nanofictionary is not Alright, well, I disagree, but I definitely prescribed to a broader definition of game.

372
00:20:56,233 --> 00:21:00,270
Rym: But anyway, if you've never seen a marching band like a real one check out this video.

373
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:00,712
Rym: it's cool.

374
00:21:01,114 --> 00:21:06,996
Rym: if you have seen them then check these guys out because there's some of the best in the world and That's all I got to say about that.

375
00:21:07,358 --> 00:21:13,161
Scott: Yeah, so I like Merchandise like especially merchandise.

376
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:14,850
Scott: You can't get consumer haul.

377
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:16,694
Scott: Well, it's really.

378
00:21:16,715 --> 00:21:21,268
Scott: I don't know if I like it because I can't get it or because I didn't wasn't able to get it I don't know.

379
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:30,942
Scott: But the point is is there a lot of cool things out there that you can't buy in stores Because they're from Japan and they usually involve Nintendo?

380
00:21:30,962 --> 00:21:33,550
Scott: and I already got one of them and it was a little diorama.

381
00:21:34,235 --> 00:21:36,430
Scott: When like I didn't realize and I got the diorama.

382
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:40,489
Scott: But Mario is like a magnet and you can move them around with this magnet and it's really really cool.

383
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:44,780
Scott: But the latest trend is these things called dots.

384
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,607
Scott: Did you ever play with like light bright or anything?

385
00:21:47,627 --> 00:21:49,534
Rym: I Had a light bright.

386
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,789
Rym: I liked it a little bit and then I got tired of it.

387
00:21:53,193 --> 00:21:54,550
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty much how light bright goes.

388
00:21:54,630 --> 00:22:01,430
Scott: But imagine if you had a light bright that didn't light up so it was crummier, but at the same time it came with.

389
00:22:02,715 --> 00:22:03,501
Scott: It was horrible.

390
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,248
Scott: it came with Dot, all right.

391
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:11,050
Rym: Wow, basically, these are just little Nintendo things where you can put pixels from various pallets to make various Nintendo sprites.

392
00:22:11,713 --> 00:22:15,130
Rym: It's awesome to put it very succinctly since Scott was gonna go off on something.

393
00:22:15,512 --> 00:22:19,670
Scott: Yeah, so the newest one there's one where you can make Mario and a goomba and stuff.

394
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:28,029
Scott: But the newest one you can make blue ring link and give dough and the ghost from the graveyard and you don't know the ghost Name, I forget the ghost name.

395
00:22:29,111 --> 00:22:30,778
Scott: I'd remember it if you said it like.

396
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,362
Scott: you said a bunch of things and said which one of those is the name of the Ghost in the graveyard.

397
00:22:34,382 --> 00:22:34,869
Scott: I'd say that one.

398
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:39,795
Scott: But I don't remember The blue.

399
00:22:39,815 --> 00:22:47,638
Scott: he's not a tech tight a lever the guys come out of the ground or levers a Goria a blue Goria.

400
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:48,926
Rym: I remember a long time ago.

401
00:22:48,966 --> 00:22:55,028
Rym: We had an argument It was a fierce one about what the name of the first sword in Zelda 1 was.

402
00:22:55,429 --> 00:22:58,130
Rym: Oh guys Remember there's the white sword and the master sword.

403
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,805
Scott: Yeah, you can make the white sword and the magic shield with this set.

404
00:23:01,127 --> 00:23:03,010
Scott: No, dude Oh, you can also make the normal shield.

405
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:07,750
Rym: But anyway, but there's the original sword and I had always called it the red sword because it was red.

406
00:23:08,031 --> 00:23:13,310
Scott: I had always called it the wooden sword because I remember seeing the words wooden sword somewhere and it was brown.

407
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,719
Scott: What other sword is brown?

408
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:16,530
Scott: It's not made of metal unless it's a rusted.

409
00:23:16,843 --> 00:23:16,990
Rym: Yeah.

410
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:27,717
Rym: So we argued about this for quite some time and then I remembered that I actually had the original Instruction book and I dug it out and I opened it and you know, it was called sword Thus or it wasn't even called the sword.

411
00:23:27,737 --> 00:23:28,921
Scott: It was just called sword.

412
00:23:29,343 --> 00:23:31,490
Rym: So yeah, that's that anecdote.

413
00:23:31,751 --> 00:23:32,514
Scott: You know you want to do?

414
00:23:32,554 --> 00:23:37,270
Scott: you want to get four freaking heart containers before even beating any levels and go get the white sword.

415
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:42,290
Scott: That's useful because the sword sucks unless you're one of those awesome guys who beats the game with sword.

416
00:23:42,892 --> 00:23:47,268
Rym: Well, anyway, since today is a video game board game and etc.

417
00:23:47,288 --> 00:23:56,833
Rym: day Yeah, well first of all, like we said yesterday we were in Rochester over the weekend and between the two of us We bought a hundred and eighty dollars worth of board game a lot of board games And you know what?

418
00:23:56,874 --> 00:23:58,303
Scott: We're going to uber con this weekend.

419
00:23:58,323 --> 00:23:59,329
Scott: We're gonna get more games from.

420
00:23:59,496 --> 00:24:02,108
Rym: Yeah We're gonna get more games and then play all the games we bought.

421
00:24:02,229 --> 00:24:06,866
Scott: so Expect at least one or two German board games a week for the next few weeks on Tuesdays.

422
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:11,269
Rym: now today We're gonna talk about through the desert which is a fun little pastel camel game.

423
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:14,220
Scott: We've played it a long time ago, but we recently got it again.

424
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,168
Rym: Yeah, because kind of cheap but also Scott I didn't get to play it.

425
00:24:18,411 --> 00:24:23,010
Rym: My computer's slow and I don't have windows but Scott played the fear demo that we had talked about a while ago.

426
00:24:23,352 --> 00:24:25,025
Scott: Yeah, it was that new PC game.

427
00:24:25,146 --> 00:24:27,157
Scott: fear Fears pretty much.

428
00:24:27,177 --> 00:24:28,644
Scott: I installed it.

429
00:24:28,685 --> 00:24:29,067
Scott: It was 600 megs.

430
00:24:29,911 --> 00:24:35,795
Scott: I got the single-player demo because I didn't really want to play any multiplayer business and it was an FPS.

431
00:24:36,378 --> 00:24:42,642
Scott: and the first thing I got to say about it is I had to sit through about five to ten minutes of cinematic.

432
00:24:42,802 --> 00:24:45,350
Scott: I can't control anything stuff before I could play what?

433
00:24:45,991 --> 00:24:50,550
Scott: Yeah, I mean What is up with games trying to be movies these days?

434
00:24:51,854 --> 00:24:53,290
Rym: You know, it's not a new trend at all.

435
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:57,246
Scott: I know it's not a new trend but when games started doing that I stopped playing the games.

436
00:24:57,266 --> 00:24:57,708
Scott: that did it.

437
00:24:57,849 --> 00:25:00,358
Scott: so You know, I don't know.

438
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,170
Scott: I just really don't like not being able to control stuff.

439
00:25:03,351 --> 00:25:06,745
Scott: I remember the first time I saw Final Fantasy 9 the first like 20 minutes.

440
00:25:06,765 --> 00:25:08,070
Scott: You really didn't do anything.

441
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:14,185
Scott: You just watch plot happen and I was just like goddamn If I'm not doing stuff, why am I playing a game?

442
00:25:14,225 --> 00:25:14,849
Scott: Just make a movie.

443
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:16,769
Scott: That's the first thing about fear.

444
00:25:18,095 --> 00:25:21,756
Scott: the second thing is Let's talk about the FPS ness of it.

445
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,762
Scott: It's a pretty standard FPS.

446
00:25:23,782 --> 00:25:24,304
Scott: you walk.

447
00:25:24,705 --> 00:25:24,926
Scott: Yes.

448
00:25:25,046 --> 00:25:30,146
Scott: Shoot you reload You can use any weapon as melee so you can like hit people with any gun.

449
00:25:30,227 --> 00:25:30,970
Scott: That was pretty nice.

450
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:35,106
Scott: Uh-huh, you can lean left and right which soldier of fortune had a long time ago.

451
00:25:35,147 --> 00:25:35,950
Scott: So it's not a big deal.

452
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,534
Rym: I never really liked games that had that.

453
00:25:37,574 --> 00:25:40,723
Rym: it never seemed very realistic feeling to do it.

454
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:50,643
Scott: It doesn't seem realistic feeling but When you do it, it's pretty much like I can hide behind this and then you know Shoot and then hide again without going up.

455
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:51,989
Scott: You can do it to the left to the right.

456
00:25:52,736 --> 00:26:06,568
Scott: so You know how like when you're aiming at a guy behind a crate and you're just aiming above above the crate because you know He's gonna pop up if you have this mechanic You you don't know if you have to aim to the left right or above the crate because the guy can pop out on any side.

457
00:26:07,611 --> 00:26:08,375
Scott: That's what that's about.

458
00:26:08,596 --> 00:26:11,309
Scott: But anyway, it doesn't have really anything special.

459
00:26:12,931 --> 00:26:18,450
Scott: I got to use about four or five different guns during the demo and all of them were pretty boring.

460
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:24,810
Scott: I mean the pistol shot the submachine gun shot a lot of things really fast and all over the place, too.

461
00:26:24,911 --> 00:26:27,008
Scott: I couldn't control the accuracy for crap.

462
00:26:27,892 --> 00:26:39,621
Scott: There was some sort of assault rifle, which is also kind of crummy, you know, I guess it killed guys pretty well But I don't know there was a shotgun that didn't really feel like a shotgun and I don't know I didn't like any of the guns.

463
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:40,426
Rym: So what was the game?

464
00:26:40,486 --> 00:26:41,029
Rym: just an FPS?

465
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:45,189
Scott: Well, I can see the reason that people are making a big deal out of this.

466
00:26:46,151 --> 00:26:50,847
Scott: It's because it was an FPS sort of combined with a Resident Evil kind of scariness.

467
00:26:51,249 --> 00:26:56,409
Rym: Wait a minute So you'll be walking around and then something will jump through a window in front of you.

468
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,531
Scott: Sometimes yeah That.

469
00:26:59,973 --> 00:27:12,826
Scott: the other thing is the bad guys do all sorts of acrobatic things Like I went to this right through a grenade into a room and the bad guy Jumped out the wind through the glass of the room out on to like the catwalk and then tried to shoot

470
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:14,030
Rym: on the catwalk.

471
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,628
Scott: yeah, and I can see how people think that's cool.

472
00:27:16,648 --> 00:27:20,610
Scott: and You know in that one part of the demo it was pretty cool.

473
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:24,249
Scott: It's like oh look they gave the AI the ability to do some stuff.

474
00:27:25,191 --> 00:27:29,082
Scott: But later the bad guys were like running around jumping and doing acrobatics.

475
00:27:29,122 --> 00:27:31,949
Scott: that didn't really help them strategically and I just killed them.

476
00:27:32,672 --> 00:27:37,770
Rym: Great so it's not like they're freaking ninjas in half-life that just flew around and killed you and you could barely see him.

477
00:27:38,151 --> 00:27:41,845
Scott: Yeah, this is like the bad guys are normal bad guys, but they try to do.

478
00:27:41,866 --> 00:27:51,273
Scott: you know They try to give them cinematic action movie abilities, but they don't actually use it strategically They just use it for show.

479
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:52,817
Scott: It's very cinematic.

480
00:27:53,218 --> 00:27:53,459
Rym: Uh-huh.

481
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,121
Scott: Now.

482
00:27:54,161 --> 00:28:10,610
Scott: The one thing the game has is has this slow motion Which I figured would be all cool like matrixness because the part of the plot is that you're you have advanced reflexes So you push a button for slow motion and the game slows down which gives you the opportunity to like shoot a bunch of guys.

483
00:28:10,831 --> 00:28:12,036
Scott: Or you know, I don't know.

484
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:15,130
Scott: the problem with this was is it slowed me down?

485
00:28:15,371 --> 00:28:20,250
Scott: Also, so that made it pretty much completely useless in every way I can imagine.

486
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:20,934
Rym: I don't know really.

487
00:28:20,974 --> 00:28:34,336
Scott: I could see how that would give you more time to react to something I Guess but what I really wanted was slow down time and I go around killing everyone and then time stops being slowed down Because I'm also slowed down.

488
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:43,630
Scott: sure I can get a perfect headshot and every guy shoot, but I move so slow I can't really get enough shots off and I can't really move very fast.

489
00:28:44,172 --> 00:28:52,725
Scott: So like you want to use the slow motion when you're in a dangerous situation like guys are shooting at you But if you turn it on now, you're going so slow.

490
00:28:52,745 --> 00:28:56,359
Scott: You can't really run away So you're just taking the damage in slow motion.

491
00:28:57,021 --> 00:28:59,690
Rym: Well, maybe the slow-mo should be used in different situations.

492
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:08,737
Scott: Maybe it wasn't intended the way you're trying to use it Maybe but they told you when you're in a tight spot use the slow motion to you know Make out.

493
00:29:08,978 --> 00:29:09,824
Scott: so I don't know.

494
00:29:09,845 --> 00:29:12,469
Scott: Uh-huh I couldn't figure out any use for it.

495
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:25,349
Scott: but maybe if you had really bad FPS skills and really bad aim and Maybe because the guns are really wildly inaccurate You would turn the slow-motion on and then pick guys off with a pistol to conserve ammo just shooting him in the head.

496
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:35,045
Scott: perfectly you know, but if you can probably only get two shots off in the time the slow-motion lasts and The game gave you all sorts of med kits that you could like save for later.

497
00:29:35,185 --> 00:29:37,090
Scott: So you never died anyway.

498
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:42,065
Scott: Then the last thing that happened in the demo was the scary part.

499
00:29:42,507 --> 00:29:44,136
Scott: Whoo Where they're like?

500
00:29:44,156 --> 00:29:49,210
Scott: this ghost is like jumps out at you And of course the ghost is some little girl who you can't see your face.

501
00:29:50,071 --> 00:29:52,137
Rym: Okay, typical scary Japanese thing.

502
00:29:52,178 --> 00:29:55,870
Scott: Yeah, what the hell is up with using little tiny girls to be the scariest thing?

503
00:29:56,391 --> 00:30:02,110
Rym: Well the first time someone did that it was really scary because it's just this incongruous kind of strange thing.

504
00:30:02,872 --> 00:30:04,759
Rym: But it seems like everything's doing it lately.

505
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,670
Rym: So if I see a little girl, I immediately think wow, she's the horrible evil.

506
00:30:08,326 --> 00:30:18,487
Scott: Yeah It's like occasionally like they would jump out at me like I opened a door and all of a sudden the room was upside down and the girl was standing on the ceiling and blood was dripping from the walls and they couldn't open the door.

507
00:30:18,547 --> 00:30:22,300
Scott: and well and I as soon as it happened, I was like ooh something happened.

508
00:30:22,702 --> 00:30:26,550
Scott: But then while it was happening, I was like, oh whatever It's just stupid scary crap.

509
00:30:28,031 --> 00:30:38,829
Scott: And then as soon as I was about to fight something big and with this nice rockety type But it wasn't really a rocket launcher is pretty much a thing that shot had held very few ammo and shot big powerful shots.

510
00:30:41,497 --> 00:30:42,107
Scott: The demo ended.

511
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:47,330
Scott: Great I guess I can't really, you know, make that a complaint against the game itself.

512
00:30:47,671 --> 00:30:52,209
Scott: It's just a complaint against the demo which of course they do that on purpose to make you want to buy the game.

513
00:30:52,914 --> 00:30:55,310
Rym: I guess it doesn't sound terribly intriguing.

514
00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:09,567
Scott: No, it's just an FPS with some fancy graphics stuff and some I guess quote Horror, I mean to admit we're pretty jaded about FPS is yeah I mean, I mean we grew up through the.

515
00:31:09,628 --> 00:31:13,440
Rym: you know Doom 2, oh my god is the greatest thing ever.

516
00:31:13,962 --> 00:31:15,907
Rym: Quake 2, it's the most moddable thing ever.

517
00:31:16,289 --> 00:31:17,958
Rym: Counter-Strike It's the best game ever.

518
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:21,918
Rym: Quake 3, wow It's not as good as Quake 2.

519
00:31:21,918 --> 00:31:26,433
Scott: This game really didn't have anything that Soldier of Fortune 1 Didn't have.

520
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:32,570
Scott: and Soldier of Fortune 1 I think was one of the best single-player FPS's there is and this really doesn't.

521
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:35,244
Rym: Honestly, I want to put big props in to Duke Nukem 3D.

522
00:31:35,344 --> 00:31:38,662
Scott: Duke Nukem 3D is great But have you played Soldier of Fortune 1?

523
00:31:38,662 --> 00:31:39,889
Rym: Actually, yeah, and I do really like it.

524
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:44,424
Scott: Yeah, it's a really that's one of the best single-players except for like Half-Life 1 and 2.

525
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:50,350
Scott: Yeah, but this really It just didn't offer me anything new and it wasn't particularly exciting.

526
00:31:50,571 --> 00:32:02,723
Scott: Maybe if it had come out before Soldier of Fortune 1 I would have been like, oh And treated it just like it was Soldier of Fortune 1, but as far as I'm concerned It's that game with new graphics and some scariness.

527
00:32:03,365 --> 00:32:04,208
Rym: Well, there you have it.

528
00:32:04,649 --> 00:32:15,550
Rym: Yep And I guess moving on to the German board game tonight, Through the Desert It's one of the Rainer Knizia tile laying trilogy, even though they're not all really tile laying.

529
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:19,249
Scott: I guess it's tile laying because you just replace the camels with tiles and there you go.

530
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:25,875
Rym: Yeah I read somewhere that people talked about how tile laying trilogy was just a mistranslation of something you said once and then it kind of Stuck.

531
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:30,623
Scott: Yeah Well, you know you release three games in a row that are sort of tile laying.

532
00:32:30,804 --> 00:32:32,710
Scott: ish and that's what people are gonna say.

533
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:36,903
Rym: But it's a Rainer Knizia game where it's very very very simple.

534
00:32:37,505 --> 00:32:38,930
Rym: you have little camels.

535
00:32:39,631 --> 00:32:41,955
Rym: well, you have four guys on four different color camels.

536
00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:47,367
Rym: four or five five guys, I think five guys and There are a whole bunch of piles of little camels.

537
00:32:48,212 --> 00:32:54,130
Rym: Every turn you draw any two camels you want and place them on the board in a Tron type style.

538
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:56,019
Rym: Try to surround things and touch things.

539
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:58,110
Rym: You can't run through other people's lines.

540
00:32:58,892 --> 00:33:00,949
Scott: It's sort of like nibbles plus Tron.

541
00:33:01,411 --> 00:33:10,049
Rym: Basically, you want to touch oases with your little trees you want to surround or touch little watering hole holes And you want to prevent your opponent from doing the same.

542
00:33:10,271 --> 00:33:12,720
Scott: Well, you want to surround pretty much anything because that's what you get.

543
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,230
Scott: a ton of points is by surrounding.

544
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:24,389
Rym: It's incredibly simple, but there is very much a depth of not many kind of strategy But a lot of tactics of oh, he's going this way then I'll go this way to block him off.

545
00:33:25,132 --> 00:33:27,320
Scott: Yeah, and it's like you got to know.

546
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:36,214
Scott: like if you devote camels to blocking another guy that means you're not devoting camels to getting points for you and It's tricky like that.

547
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:43,538
Rym: You can't really make big sweeping moves because you can only place two camels at a time and You're pretty much telegraphed.

548
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:45,430
Rym: what you're gonna do every time you play camels?

549
00:33:45,871 --> 00:33:49,002
Rym: Oh, look Ryms trying to make a line across that area of the desert here.

550
00:33:49,083 --> 00:33:53,342
Scott: I come yeah, or oh He's making a line across that area desert.

551
00:33:53,362 --> 00:33:54,530
Scott: there's nothing I can do about it.

552
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,830
Scott: Let me go over here and try to make a line across the desert.

553
00:33:57,111 --> 00:34:00,108
Rym: Oh, no, I have to go stop that other line, but now he has time to stop my line.

554
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:06,342
Rym: Now that's the two-player version playing with the full allotment of four or five people.

555
00:34:06,423 --> 00:34:07,305
Rym: the game is very different.

556
00:34:07,706 --> 00:34:15,746
Rym: Yeah, I Mean every time your turn comes around you just play two camels and then four other people each play two camels before it gets to you again.

557
00:34:17,132 --> 00:34:19,244
Scott: It can get really painful in the four and five players.

558
00:34:19,284 --> 00:34:23,900
Scott: You're pretty much just Scrounging for points as they get cleaned up almost immediately.

559
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:29,119
Scott: Yeah, and your chances of surrounding something are almost nil Because there's always someone in the way.

560
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:31,050
Rym: I used to always have success.

561
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,944
Rym: I'll point out that in the two games of this we played since we bought it.

562
00:34:34,103 --> 00:34:35,089
Rym: I won both times.

563
00:34:35,891 --> 00:34:38,158
Scott: Yeah, it's because I always got stuck in like.

564
00:34:38,197 --> 00:34:49,385
Scott: I didn't want to devote resources to stopping you because I thought that I could do Better by just collecting points for me, but no no no Hamels in your way ahead of time ready for you to try anything.

565
00:34:49,666 --> 00:35:05,082
Rym: yeah, I Tried to do that, but not so well I Mean, I guess why we'd love to say more about it, but it's a very simple game, and it's very enjoyable And it's pretty cheap, so I highly recommend Rainier Knizia's through the desert.

566
00:35:05,423 --> 00:35:06,646
Scott: Yeah, it's really good.

567
00:35:06,706 --> 00:35:09,890
Scott: Especially if you Aren't super hardcore.

568
00:35:10,432 --> 00:35:11,375
Rym: It's definitely a quick.

569
00:35:11,395 --> 00:35:16,521
Rym: you can just pick it up plop it down play a game straight through in about five minutes and the past I'll camels are pretty.

570
00:35:17,228 --> 00:35:19,980
Rym: yeah It's got very high production values other than the board.

571
00:35:20,301 --> 00:35:27,489
Rym: the board itself when you open it is real Wobbly and you have to kind of break its back a little bit on the bindings to make it flat.

572
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:31,044
Rym: They got a real carefully you'll break the board entirely and then you'll cry.

573
00:35:31,065 --> 00:35:32,230
Scott: Maybe that was just our copy?

574
00:35:32,451 --> 00:35:37,969
Rym: I don't know because I remember when way back Luke and Dave bought it And that's where we first played it and they had the same issue.

575
00:35:38,793 --> 00:35:41,967
Scott: I hate it when people make game boards that don't come out flat right away.

576
00:35:42,027 --> 00:35:42,690
Scott: It's so annoying.

577
00:35:43,051 --> 00:35:46,702
Rym: It's alright because at least Endecker had a really nice solid board with it.

578
00:35:46,983 --> 00:35:48,448
Scott: Oh, yeah, that was huge and flat.

579
00:35:49,090 --> 00:36:01,583
Rym: yeah We'll talk about Endecker another day But it's one of the old-school German games and that there's more randomness in it and more importantly it was overproduced as in There are pieces that are unnecessary that are there solely to provide atmosphere.

580
00:36:02,064 --> 00:36:03,469
Scott: You know what I love the huts.

581
00:36:04,652 --> 00:36:09,859
Rym: Yeah, whatever you and your huts safety huts You know there's a lot of controversy about the huts.

582
00:36:10,341 --> 00:36:13,213
Scott: Yeah, you know what I'm on the side of the huts Really?

583
00:36:13,414 --> 00:36:17,789
Scott: Yeah, cuz I like the huts even though I recognize that they make the game less awesome in German.

584
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:19,789
Scott: I Recognize that huts are awesome.

585
00:36:20,191 --> 00:36:23,582
Rym: Well actually apparently if you use because Endecker there are a couple expansions.

586
00:36:23,623 --> 00:36:31,047
Rym: if you use a certain expansion the huts are still there But they're not so random anymore, and it makes the game a lot more like a new style German game.
