1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,934
Rym: So you might notice the lack of music.

2
00:00:02,974 --> 00:00:04,159
Rym: we just started talking right here.

3
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:08,258
Scott: Yeah, cuz we have a special treat for you today.

4
00:00:08,278 --> 00:00:11,532
Rym: Yes It is quite the special occasion and not only.

5
00:00:11,552 --> 00:00:17,240
Scott: this isn't one of those episodes where we say Yeah, it's special because it's not a normal episode.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:23,357
Scott: Well, it is not a normal episode, but this episode is actually really special in a good way.

7
00:00:23,377 --> 00:00:33,816
Rym: Yep starting last year We began a tradition of every year when we go to Otakon having Probably some of our favorite podcast friends do a special episode for us a guest host.

8
00:00:33,877 --> 00:00:35,040
Rym: where it's our show.

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,285
Rym: It's GeekNights, but they're the hosts straight up and This year we present to you.

10
00:00:41,305 --> 00:00:42,829
Scott: I don't know it.

11
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:45,176
Scott: This is so great.

12
00:00:45,617 --> 00:00:47,645
Scott: I can't even Got them.

13
00:00:47,806 --> 00:00:50,319
Rym: I had a hard time editing it because I kept cracking up.

14
00:00:51,202 --> 00:00:53,591
Scott: I I just listened to the beginning part and I was cracking up.

15
00:00:53,672 --> 00:00:55,980
Scott: I like I felt like it didn't even need editing.

16
00:00:56,621 --> 00:00:57,466
Rym: Yeah, I know I like.

17
00:00:57,768 --> 00:01:03,500
Rym: I would have just put it in our feed straight up But I figured I should at least give the appearance of this being in the GeekNights format.

18
00:01:03,862 --> 00:01:04,986
Scott: I mean the best part about it.

19
00:01:05,027 --> 00:01:05,429
Scott: Is that like?

20
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,800
Scott: I was listening to and I was like, wow, this is really good.

21
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,680
Scott: And then at the end they were like, wow, this is double-a-plus material.

22
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,920
Scott: We should be giving it to GeekNights and I was like you shouldn't have but you did all man's yep.

23
00:01:16,522 --> 00:01:21,380
Rym: But of course the reason we're doing this intro before the actual show is just that I like to point out.

24
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:28,020
Rym: I know we have a lot of new listeners from ConnectiCon and Otakon Perhaps and I need you to know that we're all out of town.

25
00:01:28,662 --> 00:01:32,893
Rym: So this is not a normal episode of GeekNights.

26
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:38,500
Rym: if you couldn't gather in fact all this week They're not going to be any normal episodes of GeekNights.

27
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:41,786
Rym: Feel free to listen But don't get the wrong impression.

28
00:01:42,147 --> 00:01:46,600
Rym: listen to any episode that does not have the special tag on it to hear what we're really about.

29
00:01:46,912 --> 00:01:56,516
Scott: Yes if you see the word special in the title that is not a normal episode and if you're new to the show you should listen to Some other episode that just says like, you know GeekNights episode something something.

30
00:01:57,038 --> 00:01:59,207
Scott: that way You know what the show is actually about.

31
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,798
Scott: you can decide whether to be a fan or a listener or not.

32
00:02:02,906 --> 00:02:09,620
Scott: Don't judge by this episode Of course, I actually wouldn't mind if you judged by this episode because this episode is damn high quality.

33
00:02:09,808 --> 00:02:18,980
Rym: Yes If you like the what you're about to hear at all I highly suggest you check out Dave and Joel's fast karate for the gentleman outside of the 12 Byzantine rulers.

34
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:21,410
Rym: I think they're my favorite podcast.

35
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:24,383
Scott: Dave and Joelle calm J.

36
00:02:24,463 --> 00:02:27,777
Rym: Oh, yeah, and on that note, I think I'll let the boys take over.

37
00:02:28,178 --> 00:02:40,654
Guest 0: Oh, man It's GeekNights.

38
00:02:41,296 --> 00:02:59,654
Guest 0: Hi, I'm Dave and I'm Joel and tonight we're gonna talk about MD guys episode 2 the death force Don't Okay, so now we're doing The intro part where we're just Gavin.

39
00:02:59,714 --> 00:03:00,415
Guest 0: It's free flow.

40
00:03:00,435 --> 00:03:01,517
Guest 1: This is free flow.

41
00:03:02,018 --> 00:03:02,218
Guest 0: Yes.

42
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:08,025
Guest 0: So Joel I Went downstairs to check out my laundry as you know, I did.

43
00:03:08,386 --> 00:03:10,775
Guest 0: but for the internet they should also know.

44
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:19,484
Guest 0: and I'm thinking I should check out the lint trap on this dryer because Nobody in this apartment ever empties the lint trap and you gotta empty the lint trap.

45
00:03:19,704 --> 00:03:24,654
Guest 1: for is it one of those humane lint rats where they allow it to Humane back out into the?

46
00:03:24,915 --> 00:03:28,250
Guest 1: yeah humane lint trap where you just trap it and then you let it back out into the wild?

47
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,876
Guest 1: You know lint's natural habitat.

48
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,289
Guest 0: I think lint's natural habitat is in the lint trap.

49
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,857
Guest 0: Anyway, that little entrap is not the story.

50
00:03:36,957 --> 00:03:40,469
Guest 0: So I flip open the lid for the lint trap and there is a tooth in it.

51
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:43,780
Guest 0: It's a human tooth.

52
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,464
Guest 1: I Pray to God you didn't try to reach your hand into it because you know how that got there.

53
00:03:49,107 --> 00:03:53,338
Guest 1: the lint trap It's oh my god It's like an owl.

54
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,670
Guest 0: It can't I just it was more remarkably clean.

55
00:03:55,851 --> 00:04:01,512
Guest 0: It wasn't at all like when Bruce Willis tore the tooth out and army of the twelve monkeys and was all bloody and stuff I think.

56
00:04:01,552 --> 00:04:02,796
Guest 1: cuz he just tore it out.

57
00:04:02,937 --> 00:04:05,506
Guest 0: Well somebody I think somebody purposely put that tooth in there.

58
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:06,469
Guest 0: just fuck with me.

59
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:08,437
Guest 1: But now be there's some kind of a.

60
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,024
Guest 0: cleaned it up and buffed it a little.

61
00:04:10,305 --> 00:04:11,330
Guest 1: maybe they were hiding it there.

62
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:17,565
Guest 1: Maybe there's some kind of weird - I mean, there's a lot of different Customs cultures that live in your apartment building.

63
00:04:17,586 --> 00:04:21,664
Guest 1: Yeah, it's true We have a lot of African immigrants where we put our tooth under our pillow.

64
00:04:21,724 --> 00:04:23,270
Guest 1: Maybe somebody else they put in the laundry.

65
00:04:26,353 --> 00:04:26,976
Guest 0: But yeah, I don't know.

66
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:31,777
Guest 0: this is what you get living in an apartment that uh Thousand bucks a month for five bedrooms.

67
00:04:32,299 --> 00:04:33,684
Guest 0: This is the kind of stuff you deal with.

68
00:04:33,744 --> 00:04:35,230
Guest 0: It's wild and crazy times.

69
00:04:35,451 --> 00:04:36,175
Guest 1: It's an accident.

70
00:04:36,216 --> 00:04:37,403
Guest 1: Still that's freaking awesome.

71
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,302
Guest 0: I I'm still not entirely sure it happened to me.

72
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,310
Guest 0: It's just like that Queen song.

73
00:04:43,591 --> 00:04:44,494
Guest 0: Is this the real life?

74
00:04:44,734 --> 00:04:45,918
Guest 0: Is this just fantasy?

75
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:48,405
Guest 0: that Queen song the Queen song?

76
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:49,910
Guest 0: Yeah, the Queen song everybody knows.

77
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,522
Guest 0: So Joel, I guess we're talking about the news.

78
00:04:55,023 --> 00:04:56,007
Guest 0: and what's in the news?

79
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:56,850
Guest 0: Shall I lead?

80
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:57,792
Guest 0: I think I shall.

81
00:04:58,294 --> 00:05:03,250
Guest 0: so this is a bit of a self-serving news thing, but maybe this will be a bit of a self-serving podcast.

82
00:05:04,891 --> 00:05:10,370
Guest 0: You may you guys may have heard of that otaku USA magazine that's rounding the store shelves.

83
00:05:11,393 --> 00:05:13,822
Guest 0: The next issue should be coming out next week.

84
00:05:14,062 --> 00:05:20,630
Guest 0: it comes out in August and you know Most likely I'm featured in it, but I haven't really gotten any mail back.

85
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,450
Guest 0: So I think you guys should pick it up because it's the second issue.

86
00:05:25,531 --> 00:05:28,270
Guest 0: We want this thing to keep going and you get to read stuff by me.

87
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:37,946
Guest 0: I'm making the funny jokes about Odin sphere and guitar hero and how Playing guitar hero actually makes you cooler than starting your own band and it's a lot easier to do.

88
00:05:38,388 --> 00:05:39,090
Guest 0: It's a good article.

89
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,478
Guest 0: I hope it makes it in there because I was actually pretty proud of it.

90
00:05:42,421 --> 00:05:44,809
Guest 0: It has that ironic lilt that I'm known for.

91
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:50,470
Guest 1: Wait, so that's the news like we can pay to get your free opinions that we read on the Internet's.

92
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,778
Guest 0: Yeah, but now that it's gonna be on glossy pages.

93
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:55,623
Guest 0: We're talking about 80 perhaps 100 pound paper.

94
00:05:55,643 --> 00:06:00,258
Guest 1: Wow Wow, that's weighty.

95
00:06:00,822 --> 00:06:01,970
Guest 1: What does the pound in paper mean?

96
00:06:03,252 --> 00:06:07,807
Guest 0: For with it per 500 sheets, it's how much of 500 sheets of paper away.

97
00:06:07,887 --> 00:06:12,357
Guest 0: So a hundred pounds is Okay, isn't a ream 500 sheets.

98
00:06:12,978 --> 00:06:14,102
Guest 0: Maybe I don't know.

99
00:06:14,563 --> 00:06:15,867
Guest 1: There's no way of ream of paper.

100
00:06:16,007 --> 00:06:16,448
Guest 1: It's 500 pounds.

101
00:06:17,071 --> 00:06:18,649
Guest 0: Well, that's not a hundred pound paper.

102
00:06:19,397 --> 00:06:20,346
Guest 1: Okay, I guess that's true.

103
00:06:21,232 --> 00:06:22,096
Guest 0: Wait, maybe it's a pound.

104
00:06:22,176 --> 00:06:23,863
Guest 0: Maybe it's per 500 sheets.

105
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:24,727
Guest 0: That's what I said, right?

106
00:06:24,907 --> 00:06:28,960
Guest 0: Yeah Well, that's probably that stuff's like you just print stuff on that.

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,870
Guest 0: Whatever Joel continue talk about your news item.

108
00:06:32,452 --> 00:06:33,557
Guest 1: My news eat an item.

109
00:06:33,678 --> 00:06:36,230
Guest 1: I know it was about how to measure pounds of paper.

110
00:06:36,451 --> 00:06:37,213
Guest 1: I had no idea know.

111
00:06:37,615 --> 00:06:44,508
Guest 1: my news item is drawn from the the headlines that were on anime news network and I chose it because it's a pun.

112
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:50,523
Guest 1: Apparently the chars attack DVD players that were coming out are being recalled.

113
00:06:50,904 --> 00:06:53,070
Guest 1: get this because they're a fire hazard.

114
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:58,479
Guest 1: I don't know if that's a recall or and I told you so Should they just mail everyone a letter?

115
00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:00,930
Guest 1: that said we just said it was a char DVD player.

116
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:03,469
Guest 1: We didn't say it was in reference to chars counter-attack.

117
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:06,241
Guest 0: You guys should read the frying friend.

118
00:07:06,422 --> 00:07:08,955
Guest 0: You should check that listening board They have at the local target.

119
00:07:09,015 --> 00:07:10,962
Guest 0: that says all the stuff that went bad this week.

120
00:07:11,444 --> 00:07:12,990
Guest 1: How was a DVD player a fire hazard?

121
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,989
Guest 1: How much power do you have to draw to play a DVD?

122
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,975
Guest 0: I remember the ps2 the.

123
00:07:17,055 --> 00:07:23,015
Guest 0: when they remade the ps2 it could burn through discs because the laser was poorly Calibrated or something.

124
00:07:23,035 --> 00:07:23,738
Guest 1: What do you just like?

125
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:24,763
Guest 1: hold it up to an attacker?

126
00:07:24,823 --> 00:07:26,190
Guest 1: It shoots through the top and kills.

127
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:31,245
Guest 0: Careful man, I think loaded for DVD ain't nobody gonna try and rob my place ever again.

Guest 0: I couldn't think of any video game titles.

132
00:07:41,064 --> 00:07:42,730
Guest 0: I have like a hundred PlayStation games.

133
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:43,954
Guest 1: They're all too good.

134
00:07:43,974 --> 00:07:45,460
Guest 1: You couldn't think of a crack you were thinking about.

135
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,568
Guest 0: what's that one with the steampunk robots?

136
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:49,354
Guest 0: Oh Ring of red.

137
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,300

Guest 0: no no that was ps2.

142
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:04,505
Guest 0: It's the one where you had a robot and you fight like another robot And you had like little ground crew that would fight other ground crew.

143
00:08:04,746 --> 00:08:11,090
Guest 0: it wasn't that good But mostly because the missions were like 45 minutes long yeah, and you couldn't save during them.

144
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:15,446
Guest 0: I thought you were talking about that bumpy trot game that was terrible, and that was also on the ps2.

145
00:08:15,807 --> 00:08:18,409
Guest 0: I know I was ridiculously awful.

146
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:26,566

Guest 0: it's about posting wacky wild things you find on the internet such as people might post on dig Or the slash dot mostly videos of a humorous nature.

151
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:42,357
Guest 0: okay, and to that extent.

152
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:43,179
Guest 0: I'm going to cheat.

153
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:51,380
Guest 0: I know this is anime day, but my video is in reference to a vidya game But it's a Mega Man and Mega Man had many animes.

154
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:53,665
Guest 0: Mega Man powered up.

155
00:08:53,926 --> 00:08:54,609
Guest 0: no wait that was a game.

156
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,997
Guest 0: Well, so there's somebody made a Mega Man anime.

157
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:57,378
Guest 0: at some point.

158
00:08:58,523 --> 00:08:59,427
Guest 1: It was hot TV.

159
00:08:59,568 --> 00:09:01,899
Guest 1: take don't be a jerk take faith in that.

160
00:09:02,462 --> 00:09:12,857
Guest 0: and this is maybe the best song that was ever made on the internet, and it's called oku Sen Mon and it is the story of one man's life as told to the tune

161
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:13,158
Guest 1: of

162
00:09:13,902 --> 00:09:19,676
Guest 0: Wiley's Castle from Mega Man 2 which is Possibly the greatest song ever recorded during the 8-bit

163
00:09:19,756 --> 00:09:20,580
Guest 1: era there.

164
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,515
Guest 0: Okay, during the 8-bit era during ever during the history of man's music Mozart B.

165
00:09:25,556 --> 00:09:26,980
Guest 1: Take that Ave Maria.

166
00:09:27,588 --> 00:09:28,560
Guest 0: Ave Maria Ave.

167
00:09:30,142 --> 00:09:30,968
Guest 0: That's what I'm talking about.

168
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,580
Guest 0: so what you got here is a guy.

169
00:09:32,861 --> 00:09:35,734
Guest 1: It would be better if they had a shrieking japanese man overdub it.

170
00:09:36,317 --> 00:09:36,880
Guest 0: they could do that.

171
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:37,743
Guest 0: They should do that.

172
00:09:38,426 --> 00:09:38,788
Guest 1: they should.

173
00:09:38,989 --> 00:09:41,620
Guest 0: they were so close when they put Ave Maria into Cowboy Bebop.

174
00:09:42,383 --> 00:09:44,732
Guest 0: You could have taken that extra step yoko kano.

175
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:46,820
Guest 0: you could have tried you could have believed in yourself.

176
00:09:48,202 --> 00:09:50,498
Guest 0: But Joel, please take the floor.

177
00:09:50,518 --> 00:10:04,951
Guest 1: uh My video clip is actually something that's probably going around on the internet forever But it's something I've sort of recently become aware of and that is if you go to YouTube and Google Kanye West The first video that comes up is a the video he made with daft Punk

178
00:10:05,592 --> 00:10:05,893
Guest 0: for

179
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:08,560
Guest 1: I guess it's bigger stronger better faster.

180
00:10:08,921 --> 00:10:10,185
Guest 0: It's the it's stronger.

181
00:10:10,345 --> 00:10:12,833
Guest 0: You're thinking of the original Daft Punk song.

182
00:10:12,893 --> 00:10:14,679
Guest 1: Yeah, well unfortunately.

183
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:21,977
Guest 1: Yeah, sorry I'm aware of daft Punk too, but yeah, Kanye Basically the entire theme of the video is straight out of Akira.

184
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:27,867
Guest 0: well He reenacts scenes directly from Akira and wears a pink shirt Which is well.

185
00:10:27,907 --> 00:10:31,160
Guest 0: Kanye was doing that before, but you like to think he got inspired by Kinada.

186
00:10:31,523 --> 00:10:32,936
Guest 0: There's so many things to talk about.

187
00:10:33,581 --> 00:10:35,212
Guest 0: Kanye West re anime.

188
00:10:35,514 --> 00:10:36,058
Guest 0: I think the most.

189
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:43,339
Guest 0: well This is not directly related to anime, but I think the most important thing to note here Is that Kanye West is sampling a band who?

190
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,268
Guest 0: Uses excessive sampling already?

191
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:49,280
Guest 1: yeah, you can't really sample electronic is weird.

192
00:10:49,802 --> 00:11:00,040
Guest 1: Yeah, I feel like it was more of a collaboration than it was a sampling though because daft Punk appears in the video and It really is just their song with Kanye West in the lyrics, so it's more like a remix than a new song.

193
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:00,827
Guest 0: I don't know.

194
00:11:00,887 --> 00:11:06,112
Guest 0: This is like when P. Diddy did The song about Biggie Smalls.

195
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:08,239
Guest 1: oh yeah every step you take.

196
00:11:11,021 --> 00:11:12,184
Guest 0: But I don't know.

197
00:11:12,265 --> 00:11:14,250
Guest 0: Kanye West may be a secret anime fan.

198
00:11:14,391 --> 00:11:15,454
Guest 0: What's the secret?

199
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:16,236
Guest 1: He's just a nerd.

200
00:11:16,537 --> 00:11:17,500
Guest 0: well he yeah.

201
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:19,679
Guest 0: But uh what's the song?

202
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,629
Guest 1: Are you thinking a fly guy?

203
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:22,831
Guest 0: Yeah?

204
00:11:22,851 --> 00:11:24,620
Guest 0: That's the sky where the the guy on it?

205
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:26,780
Guest 0: Yes, loop on the third.

206
00:11:27,681 --> 00:11:40,376
Guest 0: So there might be more than meets the eye here, but there is a storied history of hip hip-hop artists Enjoying Japanese culture as evidenced by say tell the funky homo sapiens protoculture song.

207
00:11:40,998 --> 00:11:48,168
Guest 0: yeah Where he talks about playing sega games and how he's got to get xeno gears That's the type of game that relieves his fears.

208
00:11:48,469 --> 00:11:55,320
Guest 1: get it from overseas to here way to go del I'm glad you're making enough money to buy video games and get totally baked out of your mind.

209
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,495
Guest 1: When is the album with the automator coming out again?

210
00:11:57,535 --> 00:11:58,179
Guest 0: Yeah, you wish?

211
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,937
Guest 0: Okay, now on to the matter at hand.

212
00:12:01,942 --> 00:12:05,172
Guest 0: Are you a regular listener a fast karate for the gentleman?

213
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,075
Guest 0: We hope you are.

214
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:07,540
Guest 0: you probably are because?

215
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:14,246
Guest 0: you know the internet is one big incestuous pile of Spreading stuff around like this.

216
00:12:14,306 --> 00:12:20,787
Guest 0: so if if you listen to our show you probably listen to GeekNights and vice versa I Doubt that GeekNights has a much broader.

217
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:23,940
Guest 0: Yeah nice has a much bigger audience than us, but that's okay.

218
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,424
Guest 0: We're a little baby podcast.

219
00:12:25,464 --> 00:12:30,779
Guest 0: we we got our couple three four five listeners, and that's all we need.

220
00:12:31,802 --> 00:12:41,060
Guest 0: So if you listen to our podcast on the previous Saturday you heard all about the trials and tribulations of a man Who is not only dangerous?

221
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:50,739
Guest 0: He wasn't more dangerous He was most dangerous, and now we will continue the continuing saga of most dangerous guys with this.

222
00:12:51,862 --> 00:12:57,128
Guest 0: talking about most dangerous guys to the death force and I know what you're thinking.

223
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:06,981
Guest 1: in fact most dangerous guys to the death force is Not a reference to the DVD itself causing you want to want to kill yourself though It should be.

224
00:13:07,302 --> 00:13:10,553
Guest 1: it's actually a reference to the death force within the MD.

225
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:11,858
Guest 1: guys storyline.

226
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,058
Guest 0: well Joel There's nothing saying it can't be both.

227
00:13:14,682 --> 00:13:17,812
Guest 1: This is a man skill actness on the soul of humanity.

228
00:13:18,013 --> 00:13:22,808
Guest 0: many skilled authors will include Multiple meanings behind things.

229
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:33,800
Guest 1: so you're saying Koichi Ohada was like I should name this death force Because people are gonna want to kill themselves after they watch it or maybe they'll die during the middle like they'll just have a seizure.

230
00:13:34,643 --> 00:13:36,268
Guest 0: How great would that have been then?

231
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:37,673
Guest 0: you wouldn't have had to watch the end.

232
00:13:37,713 --> 00:13:42,450
Guest 0: what for the last ten minutes when everything turns black And white just like the atomic bomb?

233
00:13:42,651 --> 00:13:43,113
Guest 0: shoot man.

234
00:13:43,153 --> 00:13:43,996
Guest 0: That is so deep.

235
00:13:44,538 --> 00:13:48,982
Guest 0: Wow I'm not sure if the atomic bomb did that but they set off a bomb in the movie I'm gonna.

236
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:51,473
Guest 1: turns everything black and white and atomizes.

237
00:13:51,553 --> 00:13:52,899
Guest 0: it atomizes it.

238
00:13:54,062 --> 00:13:56,940
Guest 1: This is a bomb capable of atomizing everything within four meters.

239
00:13:57,882 --> 00:14:01,200
Guest 1: I hope that doesn't go off because it atomizes any part of the planet.

240
00:14:01,321 --> 00:14:01,985
Guest 1: We're in trouble.

241
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:14,504
Guest 0: what I like is they say the bomb has a range of It can atomize anything within four kilometers, and then when they're setting it up They're like are you sure we're far enough away, and the guy's like we're five kilometers away We won't even feel it.

242
00:14:14,544 --> 00:14:15,025
Guest 0: that I was like.

243
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:18,296
Guest 0: really it goes from atomization to nothing.

244
00:14:18,737 --> 00:14:21,297
Guest 0: in one kilometer Cuz that's only like a third of a mile.

245
00:14:22,921 --> 00:14:23,304
Guest 1: Are you sure?

246
00:14:23,384 --> 00:14:24,230
Guest 1: we won't feel anything?

247
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:25,799
Guest 1: well you might want to put on this sunscreen.

248
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:28,166
Guest 1: This will protect you from atomization.

249
00:14:28,386 --> 00:14:33,539
Guest 0: it take these goggles crybaby if you need them if you're a sissy, but whatever that's.

250
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,723
Guest 1: yeah I'm just gonna stand here.

251
00:14:35,305 --> 00:14:45,940
Guest 0: so MD Geist has already been defined as the most dangerous soldier and when last we saw him he was releasing the cloud of deadly robots upon all human civilization.

252
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:48,735
Guest 1: Well on Jera not on all human.

253
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:54,756
Guest 1: all human civilization Stretches to the far reaches of the stars because we've successfully managed to colonize several planets.

254
00:14:55,138 --> 00:15:09,883
Guest 1: and on Jera They were fighting a war to decide who would dominate the the gerunds themselves, or you know Earth because Earth was sort of the locus of power and they were throwing off the shackles of those oppressors 3,000 light-years away.

255
00:15:09,903 --> 00:15:11,512
Guest 1: was it 3,000 light-years away?

256
00:15:13,361 --> 00:15:16,215
Guest 1: I was just making a reference to the American Revolution because they said 3,000 miles away.

257
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:27,479
Guest 0: Hey, that's cool Because this is a lot like the American Revolution except with Bug robots that explode your head and eat you.

258
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:30,492
Guest 0: This is why does a robot eat a person?

259
00:15:30,673 --> 00:15:31,457
Guest 1: That's what I'm saying.

260
00:15:31,658 --> 00:15:35,299
Guest 0: is it Are they born that way or do they learn it?

261
00:15:36,341 --> 00:15:48,390
Guest 1: Just to recap the death force was released by MD Geist But it was created by the regular army of Jera in case they were to lose the war and decided that it wasn't worth having Anybody alive on the planet if they weren't in charge.

262
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:55,132
Guest 1: as Joel described in the last episodes sour grapes And apparently to make it like ultimate sour grapes, they didn't just make.

263
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:57,520
Guest 1: you know, it wasn't a nuclear bomb already.

264
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:04,056
Guest 1: It's kind of weird sour grapes because you have robots that hunt people down and ostensibly shoot them with the enormous cannons that are on their arms.

265
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:24,905
Guest 1: But no what they do in fact is shoot other robots that are centipedes then eat people That's Slowly and With mandibles.

266
00:16:25,126 --> 00:16:26,613
Guest 0: Yeah, which is like.

267
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:27,860
Guest 0: that's not how you want to die.

268
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:28,542
Guest 1: Like.

269
00:16:28,563 --> 00:16:28,944
Guest 1: what if you?

270
00:16:29,366 --> 00:16:42,460
Guest 1: if the only way to make this worse is if like you invented robots They killed people by exploding their reproductive organs So everybody came within like 30 yards of these robots would just have their testicles or ovaries burst.

271
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:43,827
Guest 0: I can make it and I die.

272
00:16:43,928 --> 00:16:48,898
Guest 0: the robots rape you then eat you Or they eat you while they're raping you.

273
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:51,168
Guest 1: I think if they raped you then ate you it would.

274
00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:56,326
Guest 1: I feel like if it was if both were happening at once you might Be dead before fast.

275
00:16:56,466 --> 00:16:56,667
Guest 1: Yeah.

276
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:57,489
Guest 0: Yeah.

277
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:58,452
Guest 0: Well, you might go.

278
00:16:58,512 --> 00:17:01,080
Guest 1: I wouldn't want to have both of those things happening consecutively.

279
00:17:01,463 --> 00:17:03,220
Guest 1: That's like a concurrent jail sentence.

280
00:17:03,601 --> 00:17:18,387
Guest 1: I'm really hoping for the ten years concurrent as opposed to the a hundred years consecutive like, you know, I'd rather serve my Ten year ten ten year sentences concurrently as opposed to my ten ten year sentences Consecutively Which means you're gonna be in jail forever.

281
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:19,614
Guest 0: Yeah, except in this jail.

282
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:25,439
Guest 0: It's a metal robot penis Yeah, and it's invading your rectum, which is not where that's supposed to go.

283
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:31,000
Guest 0: But really I don't think a metal robot penis is really supposed to go anywhere at least not in a perfect world.

284
00:17:31,563 --> 00:17:41,060
Guest 1: Well, they don't just to let you know that doesn't actually happen in MD guys But the robots do eat you in a most gory fashion - these robots have not learned table manners.

285
00:17:41,482 --> 00:17:47,144
Guest 1: No, they're chewing with their mouth open stripping the flesh off Leaving the skull hanging.

286
00:17:47,164 --> 00:17:49,031
Guest 1: I don't understand how they bite somebody.

287
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:51,660
Guest 1: and you know, these robots are big and they're metal.

288
00:17:52,082 --> 00:17:54,699
Guest 1: How do you manage to bite somebody and just pull off their face?

289
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,507
Guest 1: Because that happens at least ten times.

290
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:58,490
Guest 1: somebody gets bitten.

291
00:17:58,691 --> 00:18:03,708
Guest 0: that's what they just precision the precision only an Automaton could aspire to.

292
00:18:03,868 --> 00:18:04,350
Guest 0: I feel like that.

293
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:05,555
Guest 1: they designed it just you know.

294
00:18:05,575 --> 00:18:10,293
Guest 1: going back to the sour grapes theory It's like like they were doing a spitballing session and they're.

295
00:18:10,574 --> 00:18:12,340
Guest 1: they're thinking what would the end of the world?

296
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,159
Guest 1: How would the end of the world be worse?

297
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,782
Guest 1: Nuclear bomb.

298
00:18:16,264 --> 00:18:17,749
Guest 1: Yeah, I mean sure you've got you know.

299
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:20,720
Guest 1: explosion and then nothingness, but how we went to drag us out?

300
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,785
Guest 1: We don't want to destroy the planet.

301
00:18:21,825 --> 00:18:22,870
Guest 1: We want to kill all the people.

302
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,025
Guest 0: The on it's fine.

303
00:18:25,085 --> 00:18:27,394
Guest 0: If I could do whatever robots that hunt them down.

304
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:28,940
Guest 1: Okay, but how are they gonna hunt them down?

305
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,883
Guest 1: I don't know with guns.

306
00:18:30,665 --> 00:18:31,287
Guest 1: That's a good idea.

307
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:35,140
Guest 1: Wait, wait, wait, what if they're centipedes centipedes that eat them?

308
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:43,500
Guest 1: What if they're centipedes that when they bite them they cause their face to explode off so that everybody else has to watch them Getting eaten with their face torn off and they only kill one at a time.

309
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:51,404
Guest 1: Give that man a raise even though he's gonna die because he's part of the regular army and by the time this goes off we're all dead anyway or Soon will be.

310
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:54,795
Guest 1: shouldn't we be investing money in other soldiers Johnson.

311
00:18:54,835 --> 00:18:56,280
Guest 0: That's why we put you in the hallway.

312
00:18:58,841 --> 00:19:02,009
Guest 0: So where is MD guys during this whole struggle?

313
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:08,050
Guest 0: why he's fighting the death force as was his original intent But not for any altruistic reason.

314
00:19:08,332 --> 00:19:09,960
Guest 0: He just really likes fighting stuff.

315
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:15,680
Guest 0: But what he really likes is putting homeless people on cars and then driving them around.

316
00:19:16,082 --> 00:19:19,175
Guest 0: So all the death force guys come in and he can shoot him.

317
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:20,280
Guest 1: Well, he doesn't even drive around.

318
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:23,634
Guest 1: I think the plan was to crash the car into the death force.

319
00:19:24,136 --> 00:19:24,939
Guest 1: I never really got it.

320
00:19:25,442 --> 00:19:25,683
Guest 0: I don't.

321
00:19:25,703 --> 00:19:29,299
Guest 0: I don't even know why there was a car because where else would he put the homeless guy?

322
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,660
Guest 1: Yeah, or also why was the car underneath a pile of garbage?

323
00:19:33,182 --> 00:19:38,680
Guest 1: Did you know MD guy spent 30 hours hauling debris onto the top of the car to camouflage it?

324
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,600
Guest 0: Yes, so you can wait there for seven days until just the right homeless guy came along sits on it.

325
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,628
Guest 1: Then he would drive it and stand on top of the.

326
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:48,259
Guest 0: he's got a thing of malt liquor hanging on the string.

327
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,894
Guest 0: Fortran I love that stuff and it's conspicuously out in the open.

328
00:19:53,954 --> 00:19:54,495
Guest 0: the worst thing.

329
00:19:54,515 --> 00:19:55,920
Guest 0: This is I shall drink it.

330
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,593
Guest 0: Oh, no now I'm in a car and there's robots pursuing me.

331
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:01,193
Guest 0: I Was gonna die anyway quick.

332
00:20:01,253 --> 00:20:06,252
Guest 0: Let me Exposite the story of this show for 45 seconds while the credits were whole.

333
00:20:06,734 --> 00:20:11,290
Guest 1: Yeah, you maniac you I'll leave these monsters and now we're gonna have them.

334
00:20:11,631 --> 00:20:14,020
Guest 0: you get eaten well enough, but you're just killing stuff.

335
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:14,983
Guest 0: Are you crazy?

336
00:20:15,886 --> 00:20:17,090
Guest 0: and so on and so forth.

337
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:19,739
Guest 0: the homeless people not really known for their coherency?

338
00:20:22,343 --> 00:20:26,580
Guest 1: The worst part is after the car chase scene where he's driving around running away from the death force.

339
00:20:26,841 --> 00:20:27,645
Guest 1: You know how he kills it.

340
00:20:28,047 --> 00:20:32,106
Guest 1: He stands on top of another death force and shoots it with two guns Not even two big guns.

341
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:35,200
Guest 1: two guns that you could probably appropriately hold in two hands.

342
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,220
Guest 0: You could purchase them at the gun store.

343
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:38,645
Guest 0: You wouldn't even need a permit.

344
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,090
Guest 1: how tough for the death force.

345
00:20:40,813 --> 00:20:42,559
Guest 1: if all he's got to do is have two guns.

346
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:46,671
Guest 0: They were gonna believe that they were intimidated by his most dangerous aura.

347
00:20:47,072 --> 00:20:50,100
Guest 0: It works even on robots apparently being most dangerous.

348
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,847
Guest 1: It's just realizing you can shoot stuff.

349
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,333
Guest 1: I don't really see anything.

350
00:20:53,373 --> 00:20:54,900
Guest 0: Nobody else seems to have figured it out.

351
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:56,763
Guest 1: You know what else?

352
00:20:56,783 --> 00:20:57,525
Guest 1: nobody else figured out?

353
00:20:57,585 --> 00:20:59,170
Guest 1: what's happening in this movie?

354
00:20:59,712 --> 00:21:02,420
Guest 1: MD guys the first one had enough plot gaps.

355
00:21:03,224 --> 00:21:06,280
Guest 1: This one stuff just happens literally.

356
00:21:07,105 --> 00:21:10,686
Guest 1: You're you're watching it shoot to black Different scene.

357
00:21:11,028 --> 00:21:11,751
Guest 0: something happened.

358
00:21:11,811 --> 00:21:13,499
Guest 0: one of my favorite parts is where?

359
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,535
Guest 0: They figure out that MD guys is still alive.

360
00:21:16,635 --> 00:21:22,539
Guest 0: the story As much as you can call it bad is that after this death force got released?

361
00:21:23,102 --> 00:21:32,148
Guest 0: Another most dangerous soldier MD the first most dangerous old Andy Krause Krauser.

362
00:21:32,229 --> 00:21:44,860
Guest 0: he builds this mobile city fortress where he's gonna save humanity because he's got a real god complex thing going on and You know he's rescuing people, but he's sort of doing it to further his own ego.

363
00:21:46,824 --> 00:21:51,744
Guest 0: So they figure out that guys is still alive and They want to take out guys.

364
00:21:51,764 --> 00:21:55,013
Guest 0: cuz Krauser's got some unfinished business with him or something.

365
00:21:55,053 --> 00:21:55,614
Guest 0: He's not too.

366
00:21:55,654 --> 00:21:58,925
Guest 0: Happy with that guys fella and What do they do?

367
00:21:58,945 --> 00:22:01,497
Guest 0: it cuts to black and then it opens up.

368
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:02,060
Guest 0: on the next scene?

369
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,843
Guest 0: There's a scientist sitting next to a delivered cyborg, and he says hey You're a cyborg.

370
00:22:07,144 --> 00:22:09,693
Guest 0: remember when you were working on that most dangerous project.

371
00:22:10,355 --> 00:22:11,760
Guest 0: now go find my MD guys.

372
00:22:12,483 --> 00:22:14,631
Guest 0: Well, then the next scene is he finds MD guys.

373
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,660
Guest 0: well, and he has a robot suit on.

374
00:22:17,342 --> 00:22:26,827
Guest 1: What's even worse is like the entire story that I mean cuz it kind of follows that where the the I guess the cyborgs name is Eagle Did not catch that.

375
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:28,236
Guest 1: well, that's cuz they said it once.

376
00:22:28,276 --> 00:22:30,225
Guest 1: he says Eagle you're especially dirty.

377
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:34,039
Guest 1: you come do this job, and you're thinking who the hell is Eagle and why is he dirty?

378
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:36,185
Guest 0: and He's a dirty girl.

379
00:22:36,346 --> 00:22:38,175
Guest 1: dirty, but anyway dirty white boy.

380
00:22:38,476 --> 00:22:44,353
Guest 1: all you see is Empty guys like walking through a swamp and then Eagle pops out and attacks him with

381
00:22:44,373 --> 00:22:46,478
Guest 0: this super sweet robot suit

382
00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:54,436
Guest 1: nothing After that like I mean or MD guys also, but they they explode out of water at each other multiple times But you don't know who's killing who?

383
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,642
Guest 1: Apparently.

384
00:22:56,662 --> 00:23:05,977
Guest 1: and but while this is happening they then flash back and tell the entire Backstory, but also the current story in still frame animation with a voiceover mm-hmm.

385
00:23:06,157 --> 00:23:07,020
Guest 1: How weak is that?

386
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:14,390
Guest 0: Well with 45 minutes you kind of got a budget your time Joel more like without enough money You kind of have to budget your animation.

387
00:23:14,772 --> 00:23:16,140
Guest 0: I can't believe they got this thing made.

388
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:23,300
Guest 0: I'm pretty sure CPM at least in part funded the second episode really because they really wanted to get that made.

389
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:29,940
Guest 0: well MD guys was a big-ticket item back in like the 90s when there was nothing else out exactly.

390
00:23:31,821 --> 00:23:33,872
Guest 1: Yeah the other I don't know.

391
00:23:33,892 --> 00:23:35,420
Guest 1: this one was really weird cuz they have a bunch.

392
00:23:35,721 --> 00:23:43,800
Guest 1: There's really one montage, but because the movies only 45 minutes long and the montage is you know probably like six minutes long.

393
00:23:44,343 --> 00:23:46,860
Guest 1: It's about you know a tenth of the movie like.

394
00:23:48,042 --> 00:23:49,067
Guest 0: It's more than a tenth.

395
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:53,527
Guest 0: It's this is worse than rocky five That's rocky four and those were great.

396
00:23:53,968 --> 00:23:55,293
Guest 1: the whole movie is a montage.

397
00:23:55,594 --> 00:23:57,520
Guest 0: I wish they would make a rocky movie like that.

398
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,505
Guest 0: I watch it every day.

399
00:23:58,726 --> 00:23:59,148
Guest 1: It was all.

400
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,800
Guest 1: it's all just cut flashbacks to other rocky movies.

401
00:24:02,722 --> 00:24:09,326
Guest 1: Part of this movie I could dig it MD guys - has flashbacks to Montages that were an empty guys.

402
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:09,687
Guest 1: Well.

403
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:12,818
Guest 1: They just got the montage straight out and pasted it into this movie.

404
00:24:13,361 --> 00:24:15,349
Guest 0: Well, that's what we want all being efficient.

405
00:24:16,052 --> 00:24:20,629
Guest 1: the montage is already a shortcut But how can we make it even more of a shortcut?

406
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:23,460
Guest 1: What if we include a montage from another movie?

407
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,914
Guest 0: Brilliant give that man a gold star Bust some caps.

408
00:24:29,358 --> 00:24:30,405
Guest 0: god I love that movie.

409
00:24:30,907 --> 00:24:38,055
Guest 0: that movie was much better than MD guys But we're not talking about the big hit starring Mark Wahlberg and Avery Brooks.

410
00:24:38,095 --> 00:24:48,820
Guest 1: the worst part is the only end we've done in Phillips that this movie makes a foreshadowing is a Eagle first finds MD guys after he's finished fighting a death force.

411
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:53,676
Guest 1: You know how I know that because Eagle says that afterwards because there's no other indication.

412
00:24:53,716 --> 00:24:58,218
Guest 0: Yeah, he says thank God That guy was fighting the death force otherwise I wouldn't have had a shot.

413
00:24:58,861 --> 00:25:00,045
Guest 0: but we learned from this.

414
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:15,746
Guest 0: if you're willing to dig a little deeper that Eagle is a bit of a braggart and maybe not very self-confident because When the soldiers who apparently were not helping him, but we're kind of just hanging out in the helicopter until he got back They asked him hey, buddy.

415
00:25:16,027 --> 00:25:17,793
Guest 0: How'd you get that most dangerous soldier?

416
00:25:18,014 --> 00:25:19,640
Guest 0: He says I took him out in one blow.

417
00:25:20,202 --> 00:25:25,284
Guest 0: That's all it took was one blow, and I'm not gonna reference all that other stuff I said about how.

418
00:25:25,745 --> 00:25:32,009
Guest 0: don't worry about the fact that I'm missing both a leg and an arm Or both legs and both are now.

419
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:34,460
Guest 0: I'm pretty sure they strip him of his robot gear.

420
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:35,404
Guest 1: No, he cuz.

421
00:25:35,485 --> 00:25:38,620
Guest 1: the way he beats guys is that he tases him from his chest.

422
00:25:38,921 --> 00:25:42,300
Guest 1: Yeah after having his arm, and which is a pretty useful pose pretty funny.

423
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,760
Guest 0: I wish I could shoot the taser when his chest when his legs are from food.

424
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:52,299
Guest 1: There's this hilarious scene where he's in water, and he's floating up, and then his legs float up in front of him And he shouts ah my legs.

425
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:59,288
Guest 1: You know it's kind of like a cyborg would say it not like you or I would say Yeah, we're screaming out of pain like oh my legs.

426
00:25:59,308 --> 00:25:59,589
Guest 0: He's like.

427
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:00,532
Guest 1: Oh, man.

428
00:26:00,573 --> 00:26:00,713
Guest 1: Yeah.

429
00:26:00,753 --> 00:26:05,899
Guest 1: He's sort of like ah this is not optimal time-consuming and pricey.

430
00:26:07,361 --> 00:26:08,707
Guest 1: But yeah, well they attempt foreshadowing.

431
00:26:08,747 --> 00:26:20,340
Guest 1: because before they get before they get on the helicopter the Driver the robot driver of the death force because the death force is a giant robot But it can't drive itself it also has a robot driver.

432
00:26:21,084 --> 00:26:23,838
Guest 1: The robot driver slinks out of the canopy and falls to the ground.

433
00:26:23,979 --> 00:26:27,555
Guest 1: yeah And you see that happen and you think okay, so he destroyed the death force.

434
00:26:27,696 --> 00:26:28,640
Guest 1: That's what that's referencing.

435
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,442
Guest 1: Wrong that?

436
00:26:30,462 --> 00:26:37,882
Guest 0: what it's really referencing is the fact that jump all up on that soldier chicken pop her head like a grape while they're in the fortress Inexplicably.

437
00:26:37,942 --> 00:26:38,685
Guest 1: how did it follow him?

438
00:26:38,726 --> 00:26:39,730
Guest 1: How did it get on the helicopter?

439
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,096
Guest 1: did the helicopter even land?

440
00:26:43,242 --> 00:26:44,892
Guest 0: Of course I don't know.

441
00:26:44,972 --> 00:26:51,365
Guest 0: landed long enough to see Eagle Eagle's got The best name for a cyborg.

442
00:26:51,406 --> 00:26:53,271
Guest 0: that's in like the top five eagle.

443
00:26:53,532 --> 00:26:54,776
Guest 1: Yeah, if that's even his name.

444
00:26:54,836 --> 00:26:55,779
Guest 1: It could be like weevil.

445
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:57,025
Guest 0: We like.

446
00:26:57,085 --> 00:26:57,969
Guest 1: I just couldn't stand it.

447
00:26:57,989 --> 00:26:58,551
Guest 1: Yeah, I don't know.

448
00:26:58,893 --> 00:27:03,067
Guest 1: said he was dirty weevil See hanging out in bedsheets.

449
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:10,209
Guest 1: in this case you must choose the lesser of two weevils come on Master and commander other side of the world.

450
00:27:10,551 --> 00:27:10,933
Guest 1: I saw it.

451
00:27:11,053 --> 00:27:11,957
Guest 1: I didn't get that one.

452
00:27:12,018 --> 00:27:14,760
Guest 1: I'm sorry Russell Crowe makes a joke about two weevils.

453
00:27:16,142 --> 00:27:16,884
Guest 1: It was stupid.

454
00:27:17,065 --> 00:27:27,148
Guest 0: so they bring him back to the city where Krauser who in my notes I have as Krauser equals blue asshole Because he's blue, and he's also an asshole.

455
00:27:27,168 --> 00:27:38,853
Guest 1: well Krauser's not even that bad though like compared to MD Geist I would much rather have Krauser Krauser's got this whole Deity complex yeah, but at least he's not a deity bent on destroying you.

456
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:39,254
Guest 1: well

457
00:27:39,335 --> 00:28:04,159
Guest 0: what I like is that the scientist when he's Analyzing Geist after they have him captured and this is the scientist that created the MD project as we find out he's talking about how Krauser is the imperfect soldier because Once he made Geist Geist has no ambition in life But to kill stuff and how Krauser is fundamentally flawed because he doesn't have that drive to constantly kill bigger and bigger

458
00:28:04,219 --> 00:28:04,379
Guest 1: things.

459
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:15,560
Guest 1: Well, I think that part of the justification was that Geist's thirst for battle helps him regenerate because Krauser has to undergo this process that keeps him alive.

460
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:21,125
Guest 0: I guess yeah, they put him in this capsule and like shoot him with gas like in spider-man 3 But only.

461
00:28:21,627 --> 00:28:26,527
Guest 1: but Geist is self-perpetuating because the thirst to murder Helps his cells regenerate.

462
00:28:26,668 --> 00:28:31,125
Guest 0: so all we know we're in a satellite in space And he would eventually die.

463
00:28:31,847 --> 00:28:36,000
Guest 1: or would he know because he would conserve energy by not growing a beard.

464
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:39,488
Guest 0: That's where all that cellular death happens.

465
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:43,300
Guest 0: all those lost skin cells it takes it never mind.

466
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,586
Guest 1: What the hell was he eating up there?

467
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:47,700
Guest 1: Maybe they shouldn't have put a life support system on a satellite?

468
00:28:48,142 --> 00:28:48,625
Guest 1: I don't know.

469
00:28:49,047 --> 00:28:51,500
Guest 1: These are just ideas that I'm thinking about out loud.

470
00:28:53,281 --> 00:29:05,619
Guest 1: The other thing that's really stupid is Krauser is apparently the only one who can fight the death force even though humanity has developed a technology that makes them effectively Invisible to the death force, but they couldn't make enough of them.

471
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,728
Guest 0: It's like the ps3 cell process exactly.

472
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:10,553
Guest 1: they came out with this great product.

473
00:29:10,753 --> 00:29:15,129
Guest 1: everybody wanted it for Christmas, but they under-produced and Everybody went out and bought.

474
00:29:15,229 --> 00:29:16,399
Guest 1: I don't know like a hand grenade.

475
00:29:18,028 --> 00:29:29,546
Guest 0: So now everybody's trying to buy the limited vibration Maskers on eBay for five times their retail value and then people are getting all Disheartened because they're like man.

476
00:29:29,606 --> 00:29:34,500
Guest 0: nobody standing in this line wants to use the vibration maskers to fight the death force.

477
00:29:34,861 --> 00:29:36,346
Guest 0: They just want to turn a quick buck.

478
00:29:36,627 --> 00:29:38,915
Guest 1: Yeah, well what doesn't make any sense is they?

479
00:29:39,256 --> 00:29:41,223
Guest 1: they only have enough to give it to The wing commandos.

480
00:29:41,444 --> 00:29:43,632
Guest 1: well why don't you focus more energy on making those cuz?

481
00:29:43,652 --> 00:29:45,639
Guest 1: then you don't need wing commandos.

482
00:29:46,941 --> 00:29:51,435
Guest 1: The people on Jara have this problem with resource allocation.

483
00:29:51,475 --> 00:30:01,166
Guest 1: first they build a death force First they build a death force then they build wing commandos And they just ignore.

484
00:30:01,406 --> 00:30:02,610
Guest 1: like really like I don't know.

485
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:06,000
Guest 1: for death force or bomb one bomb destroys the planet.

486
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:11,794
Guest 1: Nine hundred and ninety nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine row or nine thousand robots.

487
00:30:11,834 --> 00:30:12,837
Guest 1: I don't know how many you know.

488
00:30:12,857 --> 00:30:14,702
Guest 0: it was nine thousand Ninety nine.

489
00:30:14,722 --> 00:30:20,720
Guest 0: yeah, that was the maximum number, and it's not like like if there's no one another one would come back.

490
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,951
Guest 0: But for some reason they could only have nine thousand and ninety nine.

491
00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:24,955
Guest 1: I don't know.

492
00:30:25,236 --> 00:30:27,605
Guest 1: I guess that was like the Computer limit.

493
00:30:27,946 --> 00:30:30,696
Guest 0: yeah, but what's stupid is it's like in Zelda how you could only have 255 rupees.

494
00:30:32,241 --> 00:30:33,465
Guest 1: Yeah, well all you have to do is like.

495
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:35,210
Guest 1: you can just sort of have these.

496
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:44,616
Guest 1: you know death force located late locator blocking devices And if you gave one of those to me I could then wander the earth and kill all the blowing up death forces.

497
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:52,220
Guest 1: as a regular guy Well it seems to me if I could walk into them stand right in front of them and like feed them explosives or something.

498
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:54,739
Guest 0: They'd be like a little puppy.

499
00:30:54,982 --> 00:30:56,359
Guest 0: You could just hold them in there your lap.

500
00:30:56,741 --> 00:31:01,427
Guest 1: They like snuggle up and curl and then it would turn off and they bite your face off Because that's what they do.

501
00:31:01,548 --> 00:31:03,180
Guest 0: even they just they like to bite.

502
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:03,742
Guest 1: What do you think?

503
00:31:03,782 --> 00:31:03,883
Guest 1: what?

504
00:31:03,923 --> 00:31:03,983
Guest 1: if?

505
00:31:04,325 --> 00:31:10,720
Guest 1: I bet it would be even better if they just had a device that you could have like insect Camouflage where you just paint eyes on other things.

506
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,435
Guest 1: So they're kind of bite the face off of that like hold up a dummy.

507
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:14,320
Guest 0: you got like a scare.

508
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:20,219
Guest 1: Everybody walks around with a head attached to their shoulder like two of them on each side like I've got it.

509
00:31:21,303 --> 00:31:22,847
Guest 0: Stop by quantum indecision.

510
00:31:22,867 --> 00:31:25,875
Guest 1: Yeah, I now have a 60% greater chance of surviving 66%.

511
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:29,186
Guest 1: oh, yeah It's like zebras.

512
00:31:29,748 --> 00:31:32,860
Guest 1: I can't tell which one to bite which is like the dumbest camouflage ever.

513
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:39,900
Guest 1: It's like okay, so all you stand right next to me And then the line will only get one of us, and it's like how would I just fucking run?

514
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,557
Guest 0: You will after all gets bit.

515
00:31:45,081 --> 00:31:46,662
Guest 0: I Don't know.

516
00:31:46,682 --> 00:31:51,600
Guest 0: I'm just figuring if they have these wing commandos, and it's shown that while there are death force that have guns.

517
00:31:51,861 --> 00:31:56,880
Guest 0: They're not particularly adept at using them as my favorite seed of the movie is when okay?

518
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,302
Guest 0: So they have.

519
00:31:57,864 --> 00:32:00,995
Guest 0: Krauser makes the plan that they're gonna use the jingo bomb.

520
00:32:01,516 --> 00:32:01,938
Guest 1: No wait.

521
00:32:02,018 --> 00:32:02,380
Guest 1: What is it?

522
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,524
Guest 1: What is it actually called?

523
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,086
Guest 1: Let's look?

524
00:32:04,186 --> 00:32:06,214
Guest 1: I wrote it down because it was so stupid.

525
00:32:06,415 --> 00:32:07,599
Guest 1: I thought the jig nix.

526
00:32:08,805 --> 00:32:09,757
Guest 0: Get jig nix with it.

527
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:15,760
Guest 0: Is it that game where you build the tower out of wooden blocks, and then you don't want to knock it over?

528
00:32:16,342 --> 00:32:16,684
Guest 0: I don't know.

529
00:32:16,724 --> 00:32:18,392
Guest 0: You just pull out one block of Jenga.

530
00:32:18,794 --> 00:32:19,819
Guest 0: I'm pretty sure it's jig nix.

531
00:32:21,281 --> 00:32:23,934
Guest 1: That's a Jenga clone who came up with the jig nix bomb.

532
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,220
Guest 0: so right they're gonna take this.

533
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,190
Guest 1: Professor jig nix his theory of particle atomization.

534
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,434
Guest 1: who's professor jig nix.

535
00:32:30,855 --> 00:32:31,136
Guest 1: I don't know.

536
00:32:31,176 --> 00:32:31,838
Guest 1: he's that dude over there.

537
00:32:31,858 --> 00:32:32,380
Guest 1: They flashed him.

538
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:35,056
Guest 1: He's like in a lavender coat with star glasses.

539
00:32:35,116 --> 00:32:39,484
Guest 0: I'm like hey It's got the white boy afro Bitches.

540
00:32:39,504 --> 00:32:41,852
Guest 1: better have my money shut up professor jig nix.

541
00:32:42,073 --> 00:32:43,116
Guest 1: You've served your purpose.

542
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:50,020
Guest 0: platform shoes So right?

543
00:32:50,962 --> 00:32:54,317
Guest 0: So they decide that they're gonna blow up all the death force at once.

544
00:32:54,358 --> 00:32:54,840
Guest 0: cuz they're gonna.

545
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,840
Guest 0: They're gonna have the opposite of death force masking device.

546
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:03,716
Guest 0: It's gonna be the death force attracting device, and it's gonna simulate that they've got these things on a string.

547
00:33:03,796 --> 00:33:05,080
Guest 0: How are you getting killed?

548
00:33:07,001 --> 00:33:10,379
Guest 0: Basically you can put them wherever you do or do not want them to be.

549
00:33:11,662 --> 00:33:15,519
Guest 0: But yet humankind is still in peril, and there's only one city left on earth.

550
00:33:16,902 --> 00:33:18,148
Guest 1: We are retarded.

551
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:33,340
Guest 0: so yeah, so guys figures this out Thanks to the help of Eagle who has now decided that he doesn't much care for his human captors anymore But only down here cleaning up trash, but he only has a brief moment of indecision before he starts helping with humans again.

552
00:33:34,922 --> 00:33:45,090
Guest 0: So Geist gets out of his captivity Rushes to where the the jig nix bomb is and Stops them from setting it off.

553
00:33:45,532 --> 00:33:45,633
Guest 1: well.

554
00:33:45,673 --> 00:33:46,800
Guest 1: No he doesn't stop him from setting it off.

555
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,760
Guest 1: What he does is he tears out the what was it called the like?

556
00:33:52,382 --> 00:33:53,469
Guest 0: Of the attractor thing.

557
00:33:53,529 --> 00:33:54,757
Guest 1: yeah, he tears it off of.

558
00:33:56,123 --> 00:33:58,158
Guest 1: He just breaks it and then leads the death.

559
00:33:58,218 --> 00:34:00,085
Guest 0: yes That's my favorite scene.

560
00:34:00,486 --> 00:34:07,888
Guest 0: so after a brief respite with Krauser where they have a little battle and throw a couple words around mostly Krauser Geist is kind of strong sullen.

561
00:34:07,988 --> 00:34:08,891
Guest 0: He's very passive.

562
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:11,400
Guest 0: stoic is a good word to describe guys.

563
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,060
Guest 1: Yeah, that's exactly yeah, so what I go killer is one of my favorite scenes of the OVA.

564
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:21,100
Guest 0: It's all 100 verse is when he's flying across the desert because now his football armor from the first episode has wings.

565
00:34:21,724 --> 00:34:24,159
Guest 1: That was the upgrade that happened mid-season upgrade.

566
00:34:25,081 --> 00:34:29,759
Guest 0: He's flying across the desert and all the death force are just placidly following him.

567
00:34:31,744 --> 00:34:33,219
Guest 0: It's like total carrot on a stick.

568
00:34:38,022 --> 00:34:38,664
Guest 0: Nobody shoot.

569
00:34:38,704 --> 00:34:39,667
Guest 0: we've got to get closer.

570
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:41,554
Guest 0: We gotta get into biting range.

571
00:34:41,976 --> 00:34:45,589
Guest 0: Yeah, we well to be fair They don't have a human head on my table.

572
00:34:46,091 --> 00:34:46,994
Guest 1: They're not guns.

573
00:34:47,195 --> 00:34:48,520
Guest 1: They shoot centipedes.

574
00:34:50,384 --> 00:34:52,280
Guest 0: Are you gonna shoot somebody down with centipede?

575
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:55,859
Guest 0: You can shoot a centipede at him, and then he could bite him.

576
00:34:56,201 --> 00:34:59,112
Guest 0: Yeah, I guess maybe listen centipedes only attack from the ground.

577
00:34:59,132 --> 00:35:01,660
Guest 0: They're insects a very terrestrial base They know.

578
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,706
Guest 0: But if they were used if they were in midair

579
00:35:03,746 --> 00:35:16,904
Guest 1: the guns do work because the the human city sees them coming and apparently The device that had protected their identity from the death forces or from the death force which I assume like these devices are all Over this fortress.

580
00:35:16,965 --> 00:35:17,085
Guest 0: No.

581
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:18,871
Guest 0: No they only work on a personal level.

582
00:35:19,072 --> 00:35:19,915
Guest 1: well, whatever.

583
00:35:20,155 --> 00:35:21,239
Guest 1: That's another dumb thing.

584
00:35:21,299 --> 00:35:23,618
Guest 1: then Maybe you should just build a really big one.

585
00:35:24,881 --> 00:35:26,407
Guest 0: Maybe if you put them all together.

586
00:35:26,628 --> 00:35:33,660
Guest 1: Yeah, but so then the death forces show up and They shoot him with like cannons and stuff, but it doesn't do anything.

587
00:35:33,704 --> 00:35:40,080
Guest 1: Yeah And I'm thinking back to the beginning when guys took him out with two machine guns or I I remember now correctly.

588
00:35:40,161 --> 00:35:43,424
Guest 1: He didn't actually kill the death force He just shot it.

589
00:35:43,846 --> 00:35:46,817
Guest 1: it failed to shoot him and then crashed into the death force.

590
00:35:46,877 --> 00:35:47,700
Guest 1: guys was standing.

591
00:35:50,043 --> 00:35:51,046
Guest 1: How you don't even know.

592
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:54,879
Guest 0: they spent all their programming routines on the head biting stuff.

593
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,929
Guest 0: Navigation was a far second unfortunately.

594
00:35:59,149 --> 00:36:02,138
Guest 1: well if they can just infinitely reproduce why not have them crashing into each other?

595
00:36:02,178 --> 00:36:12,460
Guest 0: who cares Thousands of these nine nine thousand ninety nine to be specific, but wait Let's not leave out one of the most important parts of the movie, which is it's a very brief scene.

596
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:25,780
Guest 0: It's only a couple seconds, but when Geist is heading to where they're gonna set off the bomb He walks by the head of the Statue of Liberty Which in case you're not familiar is on earth?

597
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,152
Guest 0: Not on Jara not on the planet.

598
00:36:29,192 --> 00:36:30,439
Guest 0: They're on in this movie.

599
00:36:31,601 --> 00:36:36,045
Guest 1: Well, what's even dumber is the chick is back in this movie, too But she doesn't remember anything.

600
00:36:36,346 --> 00:36:38,011
Guest 1: when do they make that clear?

601
00:36:38,593 --> 00:36:40,960
Guest 1: they say it like maybe we'll cure you of your amnesia.

602
00:36:41,081 --> 00:36:43,051
Guest 1: And I'm sitting there, and I pause.

603
00:36:43,071 --> 00:36:44,620
Guest 0: well Joe you missed the line where she's like.

604
00:36:45,022 --> 00:36:47,276
Guest 0: I feel like I've seen those dog tags before.

605
00:36:47,296 --> 00:36:57,559
Guest 1: well Yeah But the problem is they never explain that she doesn't know who guys is because when she sees Krauser and she sees the dog tags she flashes back to Geist.

606
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,593
Guest 1: But that's how does she not remember?

607
00:37:00,654 --> 00:37:01,980
Guest 1: it's like you just showed me a picture of him.

608
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:04,629
Guest 1: And then I'm thinking am I'm amnesiac?

609
00:37:05,272 --> 00:37:08,478
Guest 1: has this movie killed some part of my brain metaphysical?

610
00:37:09,481 --> 00:37:12,131
Guest 0: And I have to say it's breaking the fourth wall here, man.

611
00:37:12,151 --> 00:37:12,894
Guest 0: This is crazy.

612
00:37:13,115 --> 00:37:14,600
Guest 1: Yeah, it did kill a part of my brain.

613
00:37:15,221 --> 00:37:16,736
Guest 0: Yeah, I wish it would kill all my brain.

614
00:37:19,061 --> 00:37:22,350
Guest 0: Now my damaged brain Celeste's soldier on with the knowledge like why?

615
00:37:22,511 --> 00:37:25,740
Guest 0: why couldn't it kill the MD Geist part of my brain?

616
00:37:27,202 --> 00:37:28,067
Guest 0: You think it would least have?

617
00:37:28,107 --> 00:37:34,456
Guest 1: that courtesy part is like the showdown between Krauser and guys to where Krauser throws Geist out a window, and then doesn't track him down.

618
00:37:34,496 --> 00:37:35,218
Guest 0: and yeah, I like.

619
00:37:35,279 --> 00:37:41,132
Guest 0: it's like Especially since guys girlfriend now Krauser's girlfriend cuz you know pitch sleeps around.

620
00:37:41,613 --> 00:37:43,538
Guest 1: She's totally banging everybody on the home team.

621
00:37:43,779 --> 00:37:47,774
Guest 0: yeah She's like he ain't dead Krauser, and he's like.

622
00:37:47,794 --> 00:37:48,880
Guest 0: I'm pretty sure he's dead.

623
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,643
Guest 0: I threw him.

624
00:37:49,764 --> 00:37:51,170
Guest 1: did you see cuz I had him.

625
00:37:51,391 --> 00:37:53,520
Guest 1: I had him in the air, and then I threw him down.

626
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:55,890
Guest 0: I just I really.

627
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,560
Guest 0: I mean I think it's okay.

628
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,925
Guest 1: There's nothing we could possibly do.

629
00:37:59,006 --> 00:38:03,504
Guest 1: I've only got a fortress full of soldiers that follow my every command And what do you want me to do?

630
00:38:03,544 --> 00:38:06,878
Guest 1: devote them to finding the one guy who could destroy everything?

631
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:18,920
Guest 0: We've built Wasting resources on these stupid vibration maskers vibration amplifiers We got if only we can make one that made vibrations appear as they normally do.

632
00:38:18,961 --> 00:38:23,279
Guest 0: I Put two of them together.

633
00:38:26,942 --> 00:38:31,160
Guest 0: The next scene guys is sitting probably exactly where he was thrown down.

634
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,384
Guest 0: He didn't even bother to move.

635
00:38:32,424 --> 00:38:37,502
Guest 0: and that's when Eagle comes in with all the guns which he calls by the way fire sticks Cuz.

636
00:38:37,522 --> 00:38:39,146
Guest 0: apparently he's native american.

637
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:40,891
Guest 1: Yeah, I'm Jara native america.

638
00:38:40,911 --> 00:38:41,874
Guest 1: That's why they named him Eagle.

639
00:38:42,255 --> 00:38:43,820
Guest 0: You know well shouldn't he be like?

640
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:50,139
Guest 1: Well see when humans first arrived on Jara there was a very rich indigenous population of cyborgs.

641
00:38:50,985 --> 00:38:52,039
Guest 0: He does have face paint.

642
00:38:53,063 --> 00:38:54,839
Guest 0: He's got like a blue eye and a white face.

643
00:38:55,862 --> 00:38:56,646
Guest 1: Yeah, I don't even know.

644
00:38:57,028 --> 00:38:59,220
Guest 0: later on Eagle gets his arms and legs back.

645
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:01,429
Guest 0: We're not sure why but he does.

646
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,819
Guest 0: maybe that was his reward for bringing guys to him.

647
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,205
Guest 1: well No, they chained him up to.

648
00:39:05,466 --> 00:39:08,800
Guest 1: they were gonna take you out because the doctor sent Eagle to get Geist.

649
00:39:09,901 --> 00:39:11,952
Guest 1: Krauser didn't want him to bring guys back to the city.

650
00:39:11,973 --> 00:39:25,375
Guest 0: Krauser was trying to kill him but Krauser failed even though apparently Krauser is so strong that he can grab guys vibrating saw And not really have any problems with that while it's vibrating.

651
00:39:25,415 --> 00:39:26,319
Guest 0: He's like just holding it.

652
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,090
Guest 0: He's like yo stop with the vibrating saw.

653
00:39:29,452 --> 00:39:30,135
Guest 1: enough already.

654
00:39:30,195 --> 00:39:46,959
Guest 0: Geist with his ridiculous like 1985 Japanese street punk visor with like the one slit in it like he's Geordie LaForge And His half nate easily is wearing like his underoos and like this all these cables coming out of me.

655
00:39:47,381 --> 00:39:48,083
Guest 0: He's like I killed.

656
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:48,805
Guest 0: well.

657
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,570
Guest 0: He doesn't even kill the doctor does he?

658
00:39:50,751 --> 00:39:51,293
Guest 0: maybe he does?

659
00:39:51,754 --> 00:39:53,620
Guest 1: it doesn't matter none of this matter.

660
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,208
Guest 0: Eventually they get they set off the jignix bomb.

661
00:39:56,408 --> 00:40:03,953
Guest 0: because though like three death force that didn't decide to follow guys Everyone already killed the soldiers who are totally ineffective.

662
00:40:03,993 --> 00:40:07,760
Guest 0: because oh my god robots I'm like what?

663
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:09,744
Guest 1: Quick, what do we do?

664
00:40:09,844 --> 00:40:10,987
Guest 1: throw your guns at it?

665
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,214
Guest 0: I think let's do something else.

666
00:40:13,294 --> 00:40:13,595
Guest 0: No.

667
00:40:13,615 --> 00:40:15,180
Guest 0: We I'm pulling the trigger.

668
00:40:15,721 --> 00:40:23,083
Guest 0: Somebody give me a spear, but fortunately the last death or the last wing commando to die Falls.

669
00:40:23,163 --> 00:40:30,989
Guest 0: so the detonator lands perfectly on the three screws sticking out of the destroyed eye beam That's gonna set off the bomb like this bomb.

670
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:33,157
Guest 0: the apparently the detonation mechanism is.

671
00:40:33,177 --> 00:40:37,900
Guest 0: you push three buttons So they're just happen to be these three screws sticking up and kaboom.

672
00:40:38,101 --> 00:40:51,880
Guest 0: And that's when everything goes black and white except for the characters eyes, and maybe I'm thinking here I'm thinking Koichi's getting a little creative right and Guy sighs are blue and Krauser's eyes are red, but who's the bad guy?

673
00:40:53,902 --> 00:40:58,936
Guest 0: As we soon find out it may also be Krauser as he kills a little kid for no reason.

674
00:40:59,016 --> 00:40:59,156
Guest 1: well.

675
00:40:59,176 --> 00:41:01,364
Guest 1: No he freaks out First.

676
00:41:01,424 --> 00:41:11,809
Guest 1: no, that's the this that that scene Perfectly exemplifies everything that's going on in MD guys because when it happens They don't show it happening.

677
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,740
Guest 1: It's not like a little kid dives in front of guy.

678
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,607
Guest 1: Yeah, you don't even know how the little kid was there.

679
00:41:15,888 --> 00:41:18,859
Guest 0: He could have been impaled on that spear when Krauser picked it up.

680
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:22,252
Guest 0: So you're telling me this crime happened before the fact.

681
00:41:22,553 --> 00:41:23,135
Guest 0: you know Joel.

682
00:41:23,155 --> 00:41:25,303
Guest 1: There's no evidence to come Contradicted.

683
00:41:25,343 --> 00:41:29,256
Guest 0: well in criminal law if you shoot somebody who jumped off a building.

684
00:41:29,296 --> 00:41:30,500
Guest 0: You're still guilty of murder.

685
00:41:32,761 --> 00:41:34,467
Guest 1: That's how gogo 13 gets paid.

686
00:41:34,647 --> 00:41:35,369
Guest 1: I murdered him.

687
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:37,175
Guest 0: Hell's yeah, I murdered him.

688
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:37,577
Guest 0: I don't care.

689
00:41:37,597 --> 00:41:38,560
Guest 0: We jumped off the building.

690
00:41:39,826 --> 00:41:46,156
Guest 0: Well, it's over there now because he doesn't have a head anymore But still the bullet is in the vicinity of his head, and that is a kill.

691
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:51,019
Guest 0: a million dollars Please plus expenses, and I went to cozy three times.

692
00:41:52,581 --> 00:41:56,032
Guest 1: You signed the contract for incidentals, okay, I love the bread.

693
00:41:56,052 --> 00:41:58,400
Guest 0: I love those breakfast sandwiches.

694
00:41:59,181 --> 00:42:00,933
Guest 0: Sometimes I get them with him sometimes.

695
00:42:00,994 --> 00:42:01,880
Guest 0: I'd like to go with turkey.

696
00:42:02,241 --> 00:42:06,657
Guest 0: It's not really much, but yeah, don't usually eat turkey as a breakfast made, but I do.

697
00:42:06,717 --> 00:42:07,762
Guest 0: I'm go go 13 Who's?

698
00:42:07,782 --> 00:42:09,679
Guest 1: you're trying to wake up not go to sleep, but whatever.

699
00:42:10,746 --> 00:42:21,784
Guest 1: but yeah like When that's that scene happens and all you know is that Krauser Apparently stab some kid in the guys, but guys is okay, even though he's just been stabbed He's been.

700
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:23,600
Guest 0: they got them all the way through.

701
00:42:23,821 --> 00:42:26,631
Guest 1: It's a clean wound and you know, but that's like the end.

702
00:42:26,691 --> 00:42:27,715
Guest 1: That's when the movie just ends.

703
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:34,939
Guest 1: Yeah, just ends Krauser's like oh, no The whole city blows up and guys survive.

704
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,082
Guest 0: Maybe?

705
00:42:37,122 --> 00:42:37,664
Guest 1: no he does.

706
00:42:37,745 --> 00:42:39,490
Guest 1: it shows him standing there doesn't it?

707
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:40,875
Guest 0: no no remember.

708
00:42:40,935 --> 00:42:42,440
Guest 0: it shows a picture of his helmet.

709
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,185
Guest 0: It's all busted up and in the rubble.

710
00:42:44,366 --> 00:42:48,819
Guest 0: I hope he's freaking to be continued dot dot dot question mark.

711
00:42:49,941 --> 00:42:51,086
Guest 0: No, let's hope so.

712
00:42:51,146 --> 00:42:53,595
Guest 0: it took him about 10 years to get the second OVA out.

713
00:42:53,636 --> 00:42:58,596
Guest 0: I think we might be do MD guys three death force?

714
00:42:58,898 --> 00:43:01,093
Guest 0: err They don't know.

715
00:43:01,113 --> 00:43:03,057
Guest 0: none of it is dangerous or sir.

716
00:43:03,278 --> 00:43:04,420
Guest 1: It's actually most dangerous.

717
00:43:05,566 --> 00:43:10,829
Guest 1: Yeah, most dangerous Most dangerous or forced death.

718
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:13,378
Guest 0: oh Man I can't wait till that comes out.

719
00:43:13,398 --> 00:43:15,427
Guest 0: Maybe they'll have MD Krauser part two.

720
00:43:16,455 --> 00:43:17,807
Guest 0: Maybe it'll be green this time.

721
00:43:18,851 --> 00:43:20,336
Guest 1: Who knows it?

722
00:43:20,356 --> 00:43:21,400

Guest 1: This is one of those shows.

725
00:43:23,648 --> 00:43:24,170
Guest 1: It's so bad.

726
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:26,190
Guest 1: It's almost worth watching cuz it's so stupid.

727
00:43:26,712 --> 00:43:30,585
Guest 1: It's not bad like ikitosan or where you just get pissed off.

728
00:43:30,605 --> 00:43:36,170
Guest 0: You're just watching this and you're like oh That's the thumbs up cuz you know somebody gave it the double thumbs up.

729
00:43:36,732 --> 00:43:39,760
Guest 0: Go for it and Koichi Ohada is like fuck man.

730
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,462

00:43:40,482 --> 00:43:42,207
Guest 0: I'm gonna make jenno cyber.

732
00:43:42,247 --> 00:43:43,170
Guest 0: That's gonna be worse.

733
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,676
Guest 0: Koichi Ohada, I hate you.

738
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:58,466
Guest 0: somebody give that man a million dollars so it can make bottom of an ocean.

739
00:43:59,491 --> 00:44:02,195
Guest 0: The metal will be made of concrete and attached to his feet.

740
00:44:09,828 --> 00:44:11,070
Guest 1: I think that that about covers it.

741
00:44:11,712 --> 00:44:12,556
Guest 0: I need a map.

742
00:44:12,676 --> 00:44:13,781

759
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:51,485
Guest 1: No, it's about some kid who's a loser, and he's like learning all kinds of different martial arts, but it's everybody's goofy and silly and the goofy and silly stuff.

00:44:54,899 --> 00:45:02,847
Guest 0: I wish there were more shows out there like MD guys and in fact People should point them out to us because this is a lot more fun to make fun of than ikitosan.

Guest 0: I told him we would do it, but only if we can walk down the aisle to the Robocop theme or If we could be lowered by chain to the altar with the Terminator 2 theme.

779
00:46:20,853 --> 00:46:23,728
