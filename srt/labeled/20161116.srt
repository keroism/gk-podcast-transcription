00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,330
Rym: It's Wednesday, November 16th, 2016.

2
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,543
Scott: -Are you sure it's Wednesday?

3
00:00:13,563 --> 00:00:14,150
Scott: -Huh?

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,618
Scott: -Are you sure it's Wednesday?

5
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:17,130
Scott: -Uh, yeah.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,503
Scott: -I just mess with you.

7
00:00:18,524 --> 00:00:19,009
Rym: -It's 100% Wednesday.

8
00:00:20,672 --> 00:00:22,850
Scott: [laughter] I know it's Wednesday, I'm just trying to hang in.

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:27,229
Rym: And tonight, we're talking about Squirrel Girl, the unbeatable.

10
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,539
Scott: -Squirrel Girl.

11
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:29,630
Rym: -Squirrel Girl.

12
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:32,128
Rym: Let's do this.

13
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:38,168
Rym: You know, I probably complain about this about twice a year, maybe once a year at the most.

14
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,570
Rym: But daylight saving time, kind of bullshit.

15
00:00:41,411 --> 00:00:42,729
Rym: And it's dark out.

16
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,430
Scott: If I ever have a company, when the clock moves, I'm just going to move the work hours.

17
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,449
Scott: Everyone 8 to 4 now, because you'll leave, you know.

18
00:00:50,111 --> 00:00:54,710
Rym: I feel like the weight around this is we should just go back, like two hours, and stay there forever.

19
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,670
Rym: I want to get up in the dark, and I don't want it to be light until like 11 o'clock in the summer.

20
00:01:01,016 --> 00:01:02,450
Scott: You can just go back to using sundials.

21
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,949
Rym: Yeah, because then every hour is a different length of time.

22
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:08,900
Rym: That's not good.

23
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:10,030
Rym: Time matters.

24
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,138
Rym: Got to keep track of time.

25
00:01:11,642 --> 00:01:12,590
Rym: Mustn't waste time.

26
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:13,890
Scott: I was cherishing.

27
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,329
Scott: But that would be awesome, because there would be a time of the year where like lunch is way long.

28
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:20,749
Rym: Yeah, I don't think it would work out that way.

29
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:22,249
Scott: It would be totally cool.

30
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,610
Scott: We got to hook up sundials to our computers so that they can tell time.

31
00:01:27,772 --> 00:01:29,069
Rym: Cloud comes in, everything's fucked.

32
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:31,061
Rym: Why are you late to the meeting?

33
00:01:31,082 --> 00:01:31,770
Rym: It was cloudy.

34
00:01:33,771 --> 00:01:39,070
Rym: So I got any news, it being anime day, because I've been not watching a lot of anime.

35
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,930
Rym: I was watching Mob Psycho.

36
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,670
Scott: It's not anime season right now.

37
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:43,030
Rym: It was.

38
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:48,110
Rym: I was watching a bunch of stuff, but I haven't watched enough to review anything, really.

39
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,570
Scott: I think I watched, did I watch all of that Mob Psycho?

40
00:01:51,752 --> 00:01:53,349
Rym: I didn't finish it, but I watched a bunch of it.

41
00:01:54,251 --> 00:01:57,130
Scott: I think I did watch the whole thing, actually.

42
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,709
Rym: Yeah, but I got distracted, and I started watching other stuff instead.

43
00:02:01,097 --> 00:02:01,650
Scott: You know, whatever.

44
00:02:02,211 --> 00:02:03,409
Rym: Westworld is way good.

45
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,249
Scott: Yeah, Yul Brynner's the man.

46
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,690
Rym: Yeah, no, the new Westworld.

47
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:07,588
Scott: Fuck that noise.

48
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,330
Rym: Scott, Scott, Scott.

49
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,569
Rym: So you got any news?

50
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:23,170
Scott: Yeah, well there's a non-news, right, which is that Miyazaki's coming out of retirement, he's going to make another movie, but we said that when he retired for the fifth time.

51
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,070
Scott: So it's not a news, it's an old news.

52
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,169
Rym: You know what he actually announced?

53
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,170
Rym: I'm going to make another movie and hope I die during it so that I can die during my last movie's production.

54
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,670
Rym: I feel like that is his only goal at this point.

55
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,846
Scott: Someone beat you to that, but they weren't trying.

56
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,110
Rym: Yup, and that movie didn't get made.

57
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,609
Scott: So fuck that news.

58
00:02:42,776 --> 00:02:43,409
Scott: Is it real news?

59
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:47,408
Scott: Is that the trailer for... That was my news!

60
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:49,387
Scott: Sorry, deal with it.

61
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,350
Rym: So yeah, your name is coming out, and there's the trailer.

62
00:02:52,692 --> 00:02:53,510
Scott: That's not my trailer.

63
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,430
Rym: Oh, what's your trailer?

64
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,510
Scott: Well, you just keep going.

65
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:05,786
Rym: Alright, so the trailer for Makoto Shinkai's Kimi no Na Wa, which I haven't seen, but is based on numbers in his best movie.

66
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,930
Rym: So I clicked on this trailer, and look, it's a girl, I assume, might be a guy.

67
00:03:11,071 --> 00:03:11,910
Scott: Nice clouds to get there.

68
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,349
Rym: Looking up at a cloudy sky with a bunch of colorful shit going on.

69
00:03:17,472 --> 00:03:17,847
Scott: Sounds good.

70
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,330
Rym: Yeah, so I mean, I guess it's coming out.

71
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,429
Rym: I guess the news is actually...

72
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,770
Scott: We had Crazy Box Office in Japan and Crazy Box Office in other countries.

73
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,945
Scott: It's coming to the US, so...

74
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,330
Rym: Yeah, there's a dub cast, which I literally do not care about.

75
00:03:33,653 --> 00:03:44,370
Scott: I don't think it's going to be the movie that suddenly has a top tier AAA box office number for an anime in the US, but people are going to go see this, including you.

76
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:59,930
Rym: Yeah, but I'm going to go see it at an ice theater in New York, probably with the subtitlies and not with this dub cast, which everyone's actually talking about the dub cast, and one, it's like the people you'd expect, and two, literally, why would you care who the dub cast is?

77
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:00,989
Scott: Because you're not watching the dub.

78
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,390
Rym: Yeah, the dubs are all the same in America.

79
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:08,210
Rym: Either it's a Disney dub or it's a non-Disney dub.

80
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:09,029
Rym: Those are your options.

81
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,350
Scott: It's even funnier nowadays.

82
00:04:10,972 --> 00:04:17,910
Scott: I was scrolling through Anime News Network, and it was like dub cast announced for the anime with the big guy, My Love Story.

83
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:19,769
Scott: Oh, yeah, it was a good show.

84
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:26,150
Scott: It's like, I already watched that whole show on Crunchyroll with subtitles, months and months, possibly a year ago.

85
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,010
Scott: A long time ago, I watched the whole show, and now you're dubbing it?

86
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,529
Scott: It's like, why?

87
00:04:32,131 --> 00:04:39,889
Rym: Well, I mean, there are reasons to dub things for mass market because there's a wide chunk of America is really afraid of subtitles.

88
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,647
Scott: Anyone who's interested in something that obscure has already seen it.

89
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:47,969
Rym: But you only dub it if you're putting it on legit TV, and you're trying to make normal people watch it.

90
00:04:48,411 --> 00:04:48,684
Scott: Whatever.

91
00:04:49,253 --> 00:05:01,190
Rym: Meanwhile, for whatever reason, going through my Twittersphere and also coming up on my news feeds, apparently there's an interview with the dub cast of the Sailor Moon R movie, which is the one we didn't watch and review.

92
00:05:01,611 --> 00:05:03,490
Scott: It's not the Candy Sky one?

93
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:13,848
Rym: Candy Sky one is the Super S movie, Space Snow Demon, and also it's mostly about Luna is the S movie, and R movie is the-- Luna the Cat?

94
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,930
Rym: Yeah, Luna the Cat is, that's actually the best Sailor Moon movie.

95
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:18,848
Scott: I should check that out.

96
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,250
Rym: We should watch and do a show on it.

97
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,710
Rym: It's short, and it's actually pretty good.

98
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,350
Scott: Does it stand alone?

99
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:24,723
Rym: Yeah.

100
00:05:25,452 --> 00:05:28,290
Rym: All you need to know is, do you know that Sailor Moon exists?

101
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,330
Scott: She punishes people.

102
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:35,749
Rym: You know that Luna is her cat, and that Luna is kind of also a human form, alien, whatever, but that never comes up in the show.

103
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,509
Scott: Yes, I know all those things.

104
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,848
Rym: You know everything you need to know.

105
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,330
Rym: Sailor Scouts do fuck all in that movie.

106
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:42,669
Scott: I'm just saying.

107
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:46,089
Rym: Also, it's a Christmas movie, kind of.

108
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,707
Rym: So I feel like we should do it as our Christmas show.

109
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:57,589
Rym: And the R movie, which is the one that I guess, it's about a gay plant that comes from space and tries to kidnap Tuxedo Mask.

110
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:58,889
Scott: That sounds like a One Piece movie.

111
00:05:59,712 --> 00:06:03,550
Rym: It actually is a lot like that One Piece movie with the plant that kills everybody.

112
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:07,847
Scott: All right, so that was your news.

113
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,490
Rym: So what trailer are you talking about?

114
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,330
Rym: I assume this is the trailer you were talking about.

115
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:13,330
Scott: The crappy live action Ghost in the Shell trailer.

116
00:06:13,852 --> 00:06:15,710
Rym: Oh, yeah, I guess that's right.

117
00:06:15,872 --> 00:06:20,989
Rym: Well, I clicked on this trailer, and all it did was put even more colors and clouds up.

118
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:35,590
Scott: Anyway, so it was whitewashed, as promised, and it's Ghost in the Shell, as promised, and it's visually good-looking, but everything that I can gather from the trailer.

119
00:06:35,973 --> 00:06:37,070
Rym: One origin story.

120
00:06:38,674 --> 00:06:40,470
Rym: The least interesting part of Ghost in the Shell.

121
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:45,310
Scott: Whoever wrote this did not try to adapt Ghost in the Shell.

122
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:55,910
Scott: All they did was take the characters and visuals and setting and made, at least, this is what I can gather from the trailer, but trailers these days, you can usually gather the whole movie from them.

123
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,409
Scott: They're done that way on purpose.

124
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:11,969
Scott: They basically took a generic action movie plot of someone with a mysterious past having to fight bad guys and just slapped it onto Ghost in the Shell characters and setting without actually bringing along the real Ghost in the Shell plot.

125
00:07:12,371 --> 00:07:14,210
Rym: Now, granted, it's all fighting cyber crime.

126
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,206
Scott: Ghost in the Shell is tricky, because depending on-- Which is the only part of Ghost in the Shell that mattered.

127
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,749
Scott: It took the parts that didn't matter, and they got rid of the part that did.

128
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,230
Rym: I mean, the good parts of Ghost in the Shell barely involve the source material.

129
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:33,170
Rym: It's just you want stand-alone complex, you want stand-alone complex second gig, and you want the two movies.

130
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,869
Scott: Right, the best Ghost in the Shells are the ones where it's like-- The manga's all goon-y, and then it gets sexy.

131
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:40,070
Scott: It's like procedural cyber crime.

132
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:42,241
Scott: It's about the bad guy.

133
00:07:42,301 --> 00:07:43,310
Scott: How do we catch this bad guy?

134
00:07:43,391 --> 00:07:44,036
Scott: What are they up to?

135
00:07:44,157 --> 00:07:50,669
Scott: Oh, they're brain-dubbing, or they're, you know, they're terrorists doing-- You know, it's always about the bad guy.

136
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:54,928
Rym: Or you want, like, Botto be at all philosophical, and like, "Oh, what does it mean for me to

137
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:55,030
Rym: live?".

138
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,910
Scott: Or, like, you know, they're hacking into policemen's eyeballs.

139
00:07:58,091 --> 00:08:09,589
Scott: It's like, it's always about that, and then they happen-- Section 9 happens to be these people who just are really good at fighting crime, and they find the bad guy, stop them, learn from them.

140
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:10,957
Scott: Moral of the story.

141
00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:12,470
Scott: That's what Ghost in the Shell is supposed to be.

142
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:19,130
Scott: This movie is gonna be about Section 9, and no one wants that garbage, right?

143
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,589
Rym: Well, you do, but you want it the way Stand Alone Complex did it in second gig.

144
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,546
Rym: Remember, they had those flashbacks like, "How did this guy join the

145
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:25,790
Rym: team?".

146
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,387
Rym: And they're like, "Well, here's an interesting segment from how this guy joined the

147
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:29,610
Rym: team.".

148
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,809
Scott: Yeah, that's two seconds long.

149
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,361
Rym: They each got an episode.

150
00:08:32,664 --> 00:08:33,049
Rym: Barely.

151
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:34,399
Rym: It was a whole episode.

152
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:38,789
Rym: Remember the one where-- The sniper episode where you get that awesome sniper stand-off?

153
00:08:39,172 --> 00:08:43,945
Rym: Yeah, but all you actually learn about-- Oh, they did something with the

154
00:08:44,087 --> 00:08:44,309
Rym: U.N.?

155
00:08:44,309 --> 00:08:44,430
Rym: ?

156
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,099
Rym: Something, something?

157
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:45,970
Rym: Okay, we're back in the present.

158
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,091
Scott: Right.

159
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:50,070
Scott: All you learn about it, you don't learn his past and his deep inner feelings.

160
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:55,608
Scott: All you learn is like, "Oh, yeah, he joined the team because they were in a sniper battle, and he was so good that the Major was like, 'Hey, join

161
00:08:55,648 --> 00:08:55,729
Scott: me.'".

162
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,109
Scott: That's all you learn.

163
00:08:58,092 --> 00:09:15,370
Rym: To push forward the ideas and the setting, and when there's serious long-term origin story-esque plot, it's like the stuff with the Major and Kuzi, which is mostly hinted at, as opposed to this movie, which looks like it's literally, "Oh, yeah, remember that Kuzi guy?

164
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,970
Rym: Let's just follow that plot, and she's a superhero.

165
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:18,880
Rym: She's basically

166
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,408
Rym: Spider-Man.".

167
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:26,090
Scott: I think the only positive thing is that Aramakis looks to be played by Takeshi Kitano.

168
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,430
Rym: Yes, that fits.

169
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,741
Scott: They did one good thing.

170
00:09:28,761 --> 00:09:29,205
Scott: Congratulations.

171
00:09:30,371 --> 00:09:32,450
Rym: All I want-- I don't even like Arise that much.

172
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:44,489
Rym: All I want is more Ushi movies, which he'll never do, or more stand-alone complex, which is literally at this point my favorite non-evangelian anime ever made.

173
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,370
Rym: That's all I want out of anime is more stand-alone complex.

174
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:52,950
Scott: Well, maybe if this movie's a way hit, then I'll make some more animes.

175
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:59,070
Rym: You need the people who are making the new Westworld to make a live-action procedural Ghost in the Shell stand-alone complex.

176
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,086
Scott: Well, maybe they'll make a TV show after the movie's--.

177
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,410
Rym: Yeah, depends.

178
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,607
Scott: That's why I think you don't whitewash the TV show, also.

179
00:10:07,612 --> 00:10:13,849
Rym: Someone pointed out that in one of the trailers, only white people talk and only Asian people get shot.

180
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,177
Scott: Yeah, probably.

181
00:10:15,784 --> 00:10:16,209
Scott: I believe it.

182
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,360
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

183
00:10:24,122 --> 00:10:26,659
Rym: When you think of a kaleidoscope, what do you think of?

184
00:10:27,325 --> 00:10:27,920
Scott: A kaleidoscope?

185
00:10:28,062 --> 00:10:28,191
Rym: Yeah.

186
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,935
Scott: That's when you look inside and you spin it and you see,

187
00:10:30,995 --> 00:10:31,398
Scott: "Whoa!".

188
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,206
Rym: Yeah, you see,

189
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:32,833
Rym: "Whoa!".

190
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:34,740
Rym: When do you think those were invented?

191
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:36,640
Scott: When were they invented?

192
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,140
Scott: Probably-- Well, I guess they needed optics, right?

193
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,920
Scott: So, after Galileo times.

194
00:10:42,261 --> 00:10:42,576
Rym: Yeah.

195
00:10:43,021 --> 00:10:48,980
Rym: But probably before the-- You know, earliest-- What action in Civ VI boosts the development of kaleidoscopes?

196
00:10:50,843 --> 00:10:54,520
Scott: Probably something related to boats, because that's where they're making spy glasses and shit.

197
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,082
Rym: So, 1816.

198
00:10:56,082 --> 00:10:56,820
Scott: That seems about it.

199
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,073
Scott: Yeah.

200
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:58,718
Scott: But-- They had boats.

201
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:02,139
Rym: What do you think they were invented for?

202
00:11:03,124 --> 00:11:04,260
Rym: What was their purpose?

203
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:06,440
Scott: They had a purpose?

204
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,080
Rym: Yeah, so-- Other than entertainment value?

205
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:18,696
Rym: Basically, kaleidoscopes were seen as this philosophical and scientific tool, and then the plebs were like, "Ooh,

206
00:11:18,736 --> 00:11:19,078
Rym: pretty!".

207
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:30,580
Rym: And all the scientists and thinkers of the day thought that people were obsessed with kaleidoscopes, and they were a weird and surprisingly powerful pop culture phenomenon.

208
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:36,997
Rym: And this is an article going into the details of the kaleidoscomaniacs of the 1800s.

209
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:40,280
Scott: So, it was the "Tickle Me Elmo" of its day?

210
00:11:40,662 --> 00:11:42,340
Rym: It was more like the iPhone of its day.

211
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,660
Rym: Like, thinkers would bitch about how young people don't pay attention to the real world anymore.

212
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,552
Scott: Or like, "Yeah, you got last year's kaleidoscope.

213
00:11:48,653 --> 00:11:49,176
Scott: I got that

214
00:11:49,196 --> 00:11:49,337
Scott: too.".

215
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:50,095
Scott: Yeah.

216
00:11:50,301 --> 00:11:51,794
Scott: "I got that since this year's model is

217
00:11:51,854 --> 00:11:52,097
Scott: better.".

218
00:11:52,821 --> 00:11:58,500
Rym: In 1819, New Monthly magazine listed the kaleidoscope as the most important invention and discovery of our times.

219
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:01,040
Scott: Are you sure that this isn't fake and this is real?

220
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,460
Rym: No, so I was looking-- I read a lot more about this.

221
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:04,340
Rym: It's a pretty in-depth article.

222
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:04,968
Rym: Check Snopes on this.

223
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:05,960
Scott: This could be fake.

224
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,699
Rym: Basically-- oh, you want to talk about kaleidoscope piracy?

225
00:12:09,622 --> 00:12:10,299
Scott: This could be fake.

226
00:12:10,801 --> 00:12:12,180
Rym: No, this is pretty legit.

227
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:16,070
Rym: I've read some primary sources on this, but basically-- I'm just saying "could be

228
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,392
Rym: fake.".

229
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:16,997
Scott: I didn't say "is

230
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:17,300
Scott: fake.".

231
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:21,060
Rym: I was not 100% convinced when I first encountered this article.

232
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,119
Rym: It's been sitting in my queue of things of the day for a long time.

233
00:12:24,682 --> 00:12:29,459
Rym: But the history of the kaleidoscope is way weirder than you thought it was.

234
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:31,580
Rym: So what do you got?

235
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,097
Scott: So there's this quickdraw.withgoogle.com.

236
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,819
Scott: It's been around, but I guess not everyone's seen it.

237
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,160
Scott: So I cheated on it with my magic pencil.

238
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,220
Scott: And basically, it's an AI learning thing plus Google.

239
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,154
Scott: So you push "Let's

240
00:12:44,195 --> 00:12:44,419
Scott: draw."

241
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,216
Scott: And then it says, "Hey, draw

242
00:12:46,276 --> 00:12:46,639
Scott: something.".

243
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,600
Rym: And then you draw what, a dick?

244
00:12:47,721 --> 00:12:48,499
Scott: It tells you what to draw.

245
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,700
Scott: So it's telling me to draw a mouse.

246
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,799
Scott: So I'm going to try to draw a mouse.

247
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,787
Rym: Draw a stereo.

248
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:52,860
Rym: All right, I'm going to do it right now.

249
00:12:53,521 --> 00:12:58,716
Scott: And then it uses machine learning to try to figure out, you know, like what?

250
00:12:58,837 --> 00:13:01,560
Scott: if you've, you know.

251
00:13:01,662 --> 00:13:01,918
Scott: All right.

252
00:13:02,202 --> 00:13:02,939
Rym: I'm drawing a stereo.

253
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:03,980
Rym: Oh, what?

254
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,239
Rym: You figured it out.

255
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:14,080
Scott: You have a time limit to draw, to basically convince the machine learning thing that you've drawn what it wants you to draw.

256
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,858
Scott: So it'll be like, you know, draw a mouse and you've got 20 seconds.

257
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:17,860
Rym: I got my cactus.

258
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,880
Scott: You can draw for 20 seconds until the, you know, AI recognize it as a cactus.

259
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:23,340
Scott: Duck?

260
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:24,579
Rym: I can't draw a duck for shit.

261
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:25,979
Rym: It's actually really hard.

262
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,718
Rym: I can't draw.

263
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:28,139
Rym: That's a duck.

264
00:13:30,381 --> 00:13:31,338
Rym: I think that's a pretty good duck.

265
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:32,800
Scott: I'm just saying.

266
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,798
Scott: So this is, that's what this is.

267
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,900
Rym: It didn't think I drew a duck.

268
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:35,340
Rym: The fuck?

269
00:13:35,442 --> 00:13:35,857
Scott: That's a duck.

270
00:13:36,704 --> 00:13:37,020
Scott: It's pretty.

271
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,820
Rym: I see an aircraft, Harrier helicopter bird.

272
00:13:38,925 --> 00:13:39,180
Rym: Okay.

273
00:13:39,621 --> 00:13:40,119
Rym: That's pretty good.

274
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:41,140
Scott: It's pretty interesting.

275
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,759
Rym: I could, I could spend some time messing around with that.

276
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:45,376
Scott: That's it.

277
00:13:45,802 --> 00:13:46,120
Rym: All right.

278
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:46,799
Rym: In the moment.

279
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,680
Rym: The book club book is Rebecca.

280
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,520
Scott: Once, once it's holidays, I'll be able to read a book.

281
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,320
Rym: So you didn't start reading yet?

282
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,180
Rym: That's good because I was going to read it.

283
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,680
Scott: I did start reading it and then I stopped and I haven't picked it up again.

284
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:00,780
Scott: Instead I read it because I'm doing other stuff.

285
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,640
Rym: I read the entire second book of the mad Adam trilogy after Oryx and Craig.

286
00:14:04,964 --> 00:14:05,175
Scott: Okay.

287
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,819
Rym: It's real good.

288
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:11,759
Rym: Like, I think the second and second book might be better than Oryx and Craig.

289
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:21,259
Rym: It just, it basically, it looks at other parts of the world during the same time period as the events of the book, the first book.

290
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:27,160
Rym: So it's like some people in the plea blends with the cheeky knobs and all that biz, and you learn about how the gardeners were set up.

291
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:27,620
Rym: It was pretty good.

292
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,092
Rym: I was digging it.

293
00:14:28,761 --> 00:14:32,020
Rym: So I guess I can finish the third book before you start reading Rebecca.

294
00:14:33,142 --> 00:14:34,876
Scott: I did start reading Rebecca, so you can't.

295
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:43,959
Rym: Uh, otherwise check out both our youtube channels cause we're doing stuff and now that it's the holidays and we're kind of home and quiet, a lot more stuff's going to be coming in.

296
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,860
Scott: I'm not home and quiet until after Thanksgiving.

297
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,676
Rym: What do you mean home?

298
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,280
Rym: What are we doing?

299
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:47,939
Rym: We have nothing.

300
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:57,076
Rym: Our next convention, our next convention is magfest, which I guess I got to write that fucking panel on quitting stuff like every goddamn day I got.

301
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,196
Scott: no, I can't even clean my apartment.

302
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:58,965
Rym: Yeah.

303
00:14:59,883 --> 00:15:00,840
Rym: I'm catching up on stuff.

304
00:15:01,102 --> 00:15:02,219
Rym: I've been working on a lot of things.

305
00:15:02,521 --> 00:15:08,019
Rym: I got to think about cutting certain other things that are big responsibilities out of my life, which might affect a lot of people.

306
00:15:08,562 --> 00:15:09,239
Rym: We'll see how that goes.

307
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,700
Rym: That sounds ominous to some of you and it should, but don't worry.

308
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,919
Rym: It doesn't affect GeekNights or any of the stuff you're looking at here.

309
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:23,039
Rym: Uh, I guess PAX South submissions closed for panels like just now because they extended the deadlines a bunch of times.

310
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:28,338
Rym: So if you submitted a panel back south, I guess maybe there's a better chance you'll get one than usual.

311
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,080
Scott: Cause they're desperate.

312
00:15:30,504 --> 00:15:31,339
Rym: Uh, worries me a little.

313
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,536
Rym: Could be submitted three.

314
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,538
Rym: Let's see if they give us three.

315
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:39,199
Rym: That'd be like the old PAX East where we do three or four every year to be worth it considering it's a trip.

316
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,458
Scott: Right?

317
00:15:39,725 --> 00:15:39,898
Rym: Yeah.

318
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,060
Rym: I mean, I already booked my flights.

319
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,697
Rym: Like I'm all set.

320
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,076
Scott: Yeah.

321
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,760
Scott: I booked everything.

322
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,748
Rym: And I'm not doing that weird thing.

323
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:52,377
Rym: I did last year where I ran from the panel to fly to New Hampshire to go skiing because the people who run that trip are like, turns out they're white supremacists.

324
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,579
Rym: So bailed on them and not going on that trip ever again.

325
00:15:57,382 --> 00:15:57,740
Scott: Otherwise.

326
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:58,592
Rym: Yep.

327
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,357
Rym: Follow our stuff.

328
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,840
Scott: I mean, if you go skiing, skiing is a really super white people thing.

329
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,660
Rym: You know, I have this anecdote from a long time ago where I was at Hunter mountain.

330
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:18,230
Rym: It's unlikely you're going to see, cause I have a basically in finance, you get Martin Luther King day off, which I learned when I became an adult, cause I grew up in Detroit where also you got Martin Luther King day off.

331
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,499
Rym: that and a lot of the South, you don't get Martin Luther King day off.

332
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:21,999
Scott: Nope.

333
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:30,494
Rym: So I tended to always go skiing and MLK day and it's always a great day cause like it's a holiday, but a lot of people don't actually have that day off, which is kind of fucked up.

334
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,739
Rym: But that's an aside.

335
00:16:32,322 --> 00:16:39,099
Rym: And I just remember there's this dude who works on a mountain and he's just this cool dude and he is a black dude just happens to be.

336
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,200
Rym: And one year I came in and he's standing there and he's like greeting everyone to come in.

337
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,619
Rym: He's like celebrate the blackest day in history with the whitest sport on earth.

338
00:16:48,565 --> 00:16:49,738
Rym: And he was just being really funny.

339
00:16:50,422 --> 00:16:53,460
Rym: That is my anecdote, but yeah, we're not going on that trip anymore.

340
00:16:54,580 --> 00:17:04,898
Scott: So squirrel girl, you actually read every page and every word of every page and every word of both of those started with the big book that has like the bad one.

341
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:14,040
Rym: Well, I wouldn't say bad, but it was a sampling of the history of this character throughout comics.

342
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:14,679
Scott: It's not a sampling.

343
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,999
Scott: That's pretty much is the history.

344
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:24,626
Rym: My thoughts on the origin of squirrel girl is that that was some ugly, ugly and like even for the day.

345
00:17:24,686 --> 00:17:26,755
Rym: that was some ugly shit like Dr.

346
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,040
Rym: Doom, fine.

347
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,880
Rym: That Durfee old Iron Man, Iron Man, sure.

348
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,380
Rym: But the fuck if I was Iron Man, I might've killed her cause I was afraid of her.

349
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,539
Rym: I think she's some sort of demon.

350
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,940
Scott: Well, she's also like 14 years old technically at that point.

351
00:17:39,403 --> 00:17:40,860
Rym: But what did that I make up?

352
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,299
Rym: Like who thought that was a thing?

353
00:17:43,343 --> 00:17:43,760
Scott: So right.

354
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,297
Scott: So when I was a kid and I read superhero comics a ton, right, this was.

355
00:17:48,357 --> 00:17:56,960
Scott: there was sort of this thing where it was like a tradition almost of, you know, you would make non serious parody comics like self parody, right?

356
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:02,377
Scott: There would be like Spider Ham or, uh, you know, the characters that were just complete nonsense.

357
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,989
Scott: Like there was a character called slapstick who was literally like a living cartoon or something.

358
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,960
Rym: So was Howard the duck on purpose or was he really part of that?

359
00:18:09,161 --> 00:18:09,780
Scott: I'd ever read that.

360
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,175
Scott: So I don't know.

361
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:10,537
Rym: I did.

362
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,259
Rym: You ever see the movie?

363
00:18:11,748 --> 00:18:12,160
Scott: Uh, yeah.

364
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:13,439
Scott: Super long time ago.

365
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,539
Rym: We should watch it again as adults and review it.

366
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:15,790
Scott: No.

367
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:16,260
Scott: Right.

368
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,280
Scott: But you know, so there'd be all these characters that like weren't like canon characters, right?

369
00:18:21,742 --> 00:18:24,980
Scott: Even characters like Spiderman would have serious times and silly times.

370
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,560
Scott: You could buy a silly Spiderman comic and a serious one.

371
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:31,880
Rym: Like when I was a kid in like the eighties and nineties, there were the what if comics are like, what if they're all became zombies?

372
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:32,940
Scott: Right.

373
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:40,020
Scott: And some things are Canon and some things warrant, but there were certain characters where the entirety of the character was a joke in and of itself.

374
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,820
Scott: So squirrel girl actually was not that kind of character originally.

375
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,100
Scott: You saw the original appearance.

376
00:18:45,782 --> 00:18:48,900
Scott: She was just like this side character, horrible demon, right?

377
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,760
Scott: The side character in one issue of iron man or something, right?

378
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:53,398
Scott: Just randomly.

379
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:01,980
Scott: She shows up and that's where pretty much all superhero, you know, side characters come from that sort of thing, right?

380
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:09,540
Scott: It used to be back in the day, there were only so many comics on the, you know, and the, not even on the shelf in the bookstore, it'd be the drug store, right?

381
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:16,640
Scott: You could get Spiderman, Superman, Fantastic Four, you know, there's only so many, it wasn't like today where there's 50 something titles.

382
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,500
Scott: So all those other characters started out as side characters in these other things.

383
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:29,520
Scott: Like the, in humans, there wasn't an in humans comic, it's just, you would read Fantastic Four and there'd be in humans all over the place, right?

384
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,296
Scott: That's where they came from.

385
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,900
Scott: So and nowadays, since it's been going on for so long, they keep running out of material.

386
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:43,720
Scott: They are constantly digging through old books to get, you know, new or old, you know, characters is like, oh, this character already exists.

387
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,020
Scott: It's already IP that we own.

388
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,140
Scott: I don't need to bother designing a new character.

389
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,880
Scott: I can just bring this old one back and the bed.

390
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,600
Rym: They're not in that many comics.

391
00:19:51,701 --> 00:19:57,539
Scott: So if you're worried about your continuity, there's not that you can sort of do what you want with them, but you have something to work with.

392
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:02,240
Scott: And it also, you know, makes fanboys excited because, oh my God, I remember that, you know?

393
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:02,696
Scott: Yeah.

394
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:07,797
Rym: Well, I mean, you know, you say that, but when you saw Boba Fett again, you were like, oh shit, that guy.

395
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:08,920
Rym: Oh, oh man.

396
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:09,436
Rym: Boba Fett.

397
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:10,160
Scott: Sure.

398
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,312
Rym: I mean, that's how it goes.

399
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:12,699
Rym: Boba Fett.

400
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,018
Rym: Boba Fett.

401
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,859
Scott: Anyway, so Squirrel Girl was in this like one Iron Man throwaway comic a super long time ago.

402
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,397
Rym: But she beat the shit out of Dr.

403
00:20:19,438 --> 00:20:19,600
Rym: Doom.

404
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,058
Scott: Right.

405
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,660
Scott: It was, it was just a silly comic.

406
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:21,897
Scott: Right.

407
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,860
Scott: And then what happened was, I guess in the nineties or eighties, nineties, right.

408
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:27,619
Rym: That second one.

409
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,070
Scott: Yeah.

410
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:37,060
Rym: So like that felt like if I, if I was going to make a comic that was like a parody of what nineties comics were like, that thing was like spot on.

411
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:41,718
Scott: So in the nineties, they would, they, the Avengers got split up into two different comic books.

412
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:49,477
Scott: There was the East Coast Avengers and the West Coast Avengers, like the East Coast Avengers was like Captain America, such and such in the West Coast, I think was Iron Man, such and such.

413
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:49,756
Scott: Right.

414
00:20:50,421 --> 00:20:54,260
Scott: And so as a joke, they were like, lol, Great Lakes Avengers.

415
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,575
Scott: Oh my gosh.

416
00:20:56,241 --> 00:20:57,098
Scott: You know, joke.

417
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,600
Scott: And it was all these silly characters like Deadpool was involved, which already means it's going to be stupid.

418
00:21:03,023 --> 00:21:03,091
Scott: Yup.

419
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:03,718
Scott: Right.

420
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,839
Scott: So Squirrel Girl was sort of like a really, you know, important character on the Great Lakes Avengers.

421
00:21:09,381 --> 00:21:14,743
Rym: Well, because she was pretty much other than the immortal guy, the most powerful and competent one.

422
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:15,520
Scott: Right.

423
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,820
Scott: Because basically it was, you know, that's, that's the joke of Squirrel Girl.

424
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,960
Rym: Even though, what's that guy's name is the immortal guy.

425
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:22,899
Rym: I already lost track.

426
00:21:23,021 --> 00:21:23,420
Rym: All their names.

427
00:21:23,481 --> 00:21:23,840
Scott: I don't know.

428
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,618
Rym: Cause it's all dumb.

429
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,800
Scott: I don't remember anyone's name.

430
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,039
Rym: Cause he's friends with death urge.

431
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:27,840
Rym: I guess.

432
00:21:27,861 --> 00:21:28,235
Scott: I don't know.

433
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,518
Rym: Who I kept confusing with the doorman cause they look the same.

434
00:21:32,281 --> 00:21:37,040
Scott: So anyway, the joke of Squirrel Girl is that she's a girl with the power to talk to squirrels basically.

435
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,659
Rym: But she also has the proportional speed and strength of squirrels.

436
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:41,995
Scott: Right.

437
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,917
Scott: And she's basically Aquaman of squirrels.

438
00:21:45,646 --> 00:21:46,219
Scott: Only a girl.

439
00:21:46,587 --> 00:21:46,798
Rym: Yeah.

440
00:21:47,202 --> 00:21:49,780
Scott: And that's usually a really stupid power.

441
00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:52,179
Scott: What could you possibly do with that?

442
00:21:52,320 --> 00:22:01,500
Scott: That's so great, but she's actually not like, you know, usually when someone has a stupid power, these stupid characters, they're, they're also dumb themselves, right?

443
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,660
Scott: Like there's a Spider-Man villain who's like the frog or something, I think frog.

444
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:07,740
Scott: And he's just like frog man or some shit.

445
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,480
Scott: He's just a dumb ass wearing a frog suit.

446
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,900
Scott: It's like a joke, but squirrel girl, isn't a joke.

447
00:22:12,222 --> 00:22:14,360
Scott: Only her power is a joke, right?

448
00:22:14,461 --> 00:22:18,240
Scott: She's like totally smart and knows how to, you know, fight stuff.

449
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:28,580
Rym: And it seems like the going theme with her is that she's the unbeatable squirrel girl because the situation she is up in are just like, man, the only thing that would save the day here is this oddly specific power.

450
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,536
Rym: Hey, squirrel girl.

451
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:30,075
Scott: Yup.

452
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:30,586
Rym: Whoa.

453
00:22:31,941 --> 00:22:41,978
Scott: So what happened was, is there squirrel girl was, you know, sort of made into, you know, brought back as a character in the nineties, two thousands, great lakes, Avengers kind of thing.

454
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,290
Scott: Right.

455
00:22:42,922 --> 00:22:46,920
Scott: And then even then it was still just a joke kind of thing for superhero nerds.

456
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,280
Scott: It wasn't anything anyone cared about.

457
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,700
Rym: I mean, that nineties squirrel girl stuff was very, I'm pretty sure it was nineties.

458
00:22:51,800 --> 00:23:01,800
Rym: I did not check, but it was just so like, like it had all these self referential callback jokes to the superhero fandom that like Deadpool with his car.

459
00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:02,700
Scott: That's what it was about.

460
00:23:02,722 --> 00:23:02,980
Scott: Right.

461
00:23:03,301 --> 00:23:07,160
Scott: It was just a, you know, jokes for, it was, you know, inside jokes for inside superhero.

462
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,118
Rym: But it was also that like, we're going to be like edgy and hardcore, like comics tried to be for a while then.

463
00:23:12,321 --> 00:23:14,899
Scott: Anyway, I only made Rym read that garbage so he could suffer through it.

464
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:31,640
Rym: But I, you know, maybe it's just because I have not consumed that like grim dark, like toilet joke nineties era comics in a long time, but I kind of enjoyed it even though like at one time I'm looking at it like this artifact from a bygone era.

465
00:23:32,181 --> 00:23:36,140
Rym: And on the other hand, I'm sort of appreciating that it existed in its time and place.

466
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,180
Scott: There's plenty more where that came from because you could do nothing but read that shit for like the rest of your life.

467
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,580
Rym: I mean, you want like 80 pages of suicide jokes.

468
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,316
Rym: Well there you go.

469
00:23:45,181 --> 00:23:45,680
Scott: There it was.

470
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,779
Scott: So anyway, uh, what happened more recently is they brought back squirrel girl in her own comic book and it's good.

471
00:23:53,461 --> 00:23:56,957
Scott: And the writer is Ryan North, the dinosaur comics guy, right?

472
00:23:57,741 --> 00:23:59,419
Scott: So you already know it's going to be good.

473
00:23:59,845 --> 00:24:00,758
Scott: And of course it is good.

474
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:02,098
Scott: It's way good.

475
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:02,559
Scott: Yup.

476
00:24:02,801 --> 00:24:03,980
Scott: And he totally stands alone.

477
00:24:04,081 --> 00:24:05,620
Scott: You don't need to know any superhero shit.

478
00:24:06,202 --> 00:24:13,880
Scott: And it's not just for superhero nerds, even though it still has the basic structure of a superhero comic where every issue you have to fight a bad guy somehow.

479
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:33,460
Rym: And it's interesting because the like nineties, middle era of squirrel girl would make these fairy comic book guy references to the old bullshit or they would do homage that you could not understand unless you'd read those old like weird golden age, silver age comics where you'd see like that character keeps explaining what he's doing while he does it.

480
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,418
Rym: And that's the joke.

481
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:43,589
Rym: But the new squirrel girl will still reference the old crap, but in a funny offhanded way that is not in Trent, like it's not.

482
00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:46,060
Rym: like it's not funny if you haven't read that old stuff.

483
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,079
Rym: It's just like an Easter egg.

484
00:24:47,343 --> 00:24:47,639
Scott: It's weird.

485
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,080
Scott: Like despite the, you know, who knows what's canon and what's not right.

486
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:56,437
Scott: But despite this being a brand new squirrel girl, that's not nothing like the old one at all.

487
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,480
Rym: It pointedly is like, yeah, she beat iron man and dr doom and all that business, right?

488
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,560
Scott: She acts like all those things totally happened.

489
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,799
Scott: And she's got Deadpool's trading cards to tell her about all the bad guys cause right.

490
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,340
Scott: Cause all that Deadpool stuff actually happened and you know, and all this stuff.

491
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,480
Scott: So, and also I want the Deadpool trading cards to tell you about all the villains.

492
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:20,998
Scott: Those are way better than the superhero cards I collected when I collected those X-Men ones and there were multiple series of them.

493
00:25:21,225 --> 00:25:21,560
Scott: I got that.

494
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:27,218
Rym: I had a lot of, I also have a complete set of the second Wolverine series, including a bunch of the foils.

495
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,320
Scott: I got a, I got a bunch of cards in my closet.

496
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:30,120
Scott: I could dig them out.

497
00:25:30,242 --> 00:25:30,496
Scott: Yeah.

498
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,897
Rym: Let's dig them out and I don't know, burn them or sell them or, but anyway, so the deal with the new squirrel girl, right?

499
00:25:36,482 --> 00:25:38,020
Scott: Is that she's going to college.

500
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,157
Scott: So I guess when she was 14 when she met iron man, she's college age now.

501
00:25:41,217 --> 00:25:45,080
Scott: that's, you can use that to measure all other time passing in the Marvel universe.

502
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,038
Scott: Good luck with that.

503
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,767
Rym: How do you even know she ages like a human.

504
00:25:47,808 --> 00:25:49,656
Rym: squirrels live like 30 years.

505
00:25:50,962 --> 00:25:52,640
Rym: So if she has the, oh shit, she's in trouble.

506
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,717
Rym: But if she has the proportional squirrel shit, then she's probably gonna live like 900 years or less.

507
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,680
Rym: No, because she's, cause squirrels are small and strong for their size.

508
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,200
Rym: She's bigger, but proportionally stronger.

509
00:26:07,642 --> 00:26:11,180
Rym: So she's probably gonna live a really long time or, or a lot less time.

510
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,579
Rym: I think she's gonna live a really long time.

511
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,960
Rym: Anyway, isn't even a picture of frog man on the, I don't know if it's called fraud.

512
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,689
Scott: I don't know if his name is actually frog man.

513
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:27,319
Scott: search for like spider alter ego, Eugene Paul, but search for like spider man, frog villain or something and see what comes up.

514
00:26:27,841 --> 00:26:29,359
Rym: Spider man, frog man.

515
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,132
Scott: All right.

516
00:26:31,683 --> 00:26:31,774
Scott: Yeah.

517
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,100
Scott: Wow.

518
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:32,515
Scott: That's him.

519
00:26:33,006 --> 00:26:33,499
Scott: That's the guy.

520
00:26:33,722 --> 00:26:34,158
Rym: Well, you know what?

521
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,420
Rym: I never realized venture brothers making fun of this guy.

522
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:46,899
Rym: There's this dude who comes into to audition to join a super villain squad and he stands there in a frog suit that looks almost exactly like this and he throws a brick and he's like brick frog and they're like, nope.

523
00:26:50,163 --> 00:26:53,115
Scott: Anyway, uh, so squirrel girls now in her twenties or something.

524
00:26:53,235 --> 00:26:54,900
Scott: and she decides because she's so awesome.

525
00:26:55,180 --> 00:27:03,918
Scott: She's going to go to college, which is difficult for someone who doesn't have parents, at least no parents that we know of doesn't have money that I don't know where she gets money from.

526
00:27:05,022 --> 00:27:06,760
Scott: Uh, I, did she even go to school?

527
00:27:06,861 --> 00:27:07,779
Scott: I guess she's intelligent.

528
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:16,198
Scott: Maybe she got a scholarship or I don't know, but she's going to college and she is going to stop living in the Avengers attic and I don't know.

529
00:27:16,985 --> 00:27:17,700
Scott: And so they're off.

530
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:24,019
Rym: She goes, I like how tippy toes is all like you're not majoring in squirrels and she's like, ah, I already know everything about squirrels.

531
00:27:24,341 --> 00:27:36,700
Scott: Except then she didn't sure, but I guess she's going to study computer science, which is cool except they never show any computer science stuff that she's learning because she's too distracted actually doing superhero crap.

532
00:27:36,861 --> 00:27:39,600
Scott: I wish that she would, they would show some computer science action though.

533
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:39,986
Scott: Cool.

534
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:40,620
Scott: Right.

535
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,679
Scott: It's like what, you know, just saying that you're studying computer science is nice.

536
00:27:44,901 --> 00:27:48,080
Scott: Actually doing computer science and showing it in the book would be nicer.

537
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:53,000
Rym: She should have tied his tongue in a whatever, not instead of a whatever, not sure.

538
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:55,275
Rym: I can't quote Simpsons verbatim like I used to.

539
00:27:56,783 --> 00:27:59,780
Scott: Uh, and you know, there's a little bit of school drama going on, right?

540
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,640
Scott: There's like some cute boy and there's an awesome roommate.

541
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,140
Rym: The characters are all just pretty good.

542
00:28:04,521 --> 00:28:11,500
Scott: Like if you didn't know, it's a lot like the old Spiderman comics where like there would be the high school drama to go with the Spiderman drama.

543
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:23,200
Rym: Like, you know, flash Thompson, was that who it is, but you know, and like Gwen and whatever and all, but like this comic would sit right alongside all those quote unquote indie comics that you just get it like the mocha fast and you wouldn't even blink.

544
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,493
Scott: Like if you didn't know this, it didn't happen to have all these Marvel heroes and villains in it.

545
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:27,835
Rym: Yup.

546
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:34,300
Rym: But even then the way they are portrayed and presented and used is still like pretty secondary.

547
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,860
Rym: Like it's still like, it's just, it's set up like a modern comic and not like that old nonsense.

548
00:28:39,133 --> 00:28:39,280
Scott: Right.

549
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,300
Scott: And all the dialogue and such is sort of adventure timey, right?

550
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:49,411
Scott: Where they're being, they're being serious, but they're not, you know, talking like normal people.

551
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:55,160
Scott: They're talking in a slightly silly way, but still saying real things, you know?

552
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,558
Rym: Yeah, I can see that.

553
00:28:57,041 --> 00:29:00,100
Scott: Like like, whereas in adventure time we'll be like, man, it should be like nuts.

554
00:29:02,202 --> 00:29:07,780
Rym: I don't know if I like the, like put a weird sentence at the bottom of every panel.

555
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:10,380
Rym: So it feels like a web comic when you do that.

556
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,098
Rym: That is the text.

557
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,720
Scott: The dude is a webcomic author.

558
00:29:12,862 --> 00:29:14,260
Rym: In the hover over on a webcomic.

559
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,639
Scott: The dude is a webcomic author.

560
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:16,180
Scott: Yeah.

561
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,820
Rym: So I guess he's used to doing that.

562
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:22,260
Scott: And the thing is, it would be totally cool, but some of them aren't funny.

563
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:26,600
Scott: They just don't really add and let you know, it's like, it's like a cool Easter egg.

564
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,597
Scott: The fact that it's there.

565
00:29:27,921 --> 00:29:34,340
Scott: So I in the meta sense, but the actual content of the words written down there usually don't add to what you just read.

566
00:29:34,682 --> 00:29:38,518
Scott: And actually the kind of distracting cause like you're usually, I can read a comic book really fast.

567
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,260
Scott: Just going through the bubbles and the pictures.

568
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,260
Rym: Ah, young Padawan learned for the master.

569
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:47,000
Rym: I read the comic first and I went back and read all those stupid things separately.

570
00:29:47,302 --> 00:29:50,360
Rym: And then I read all the non comic, the letter pages.

571
00:29:50,562 --> 00:29:50,652
Scott: Yeah.

572
00:29:50,925 --> 00:29:51,139
Scott: Yeah.

573
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,680
Scott: So it's like they're doing everything that old comics did.

574
00:29:54,141 --> 00:29:59,739
Scott: You know, a lot of comics have letter pages even nowadays, but they don't put the letter pages in trades.

575
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,580
Scott: They usually only put the letter page in the floppy issues.

576
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:02,830
Rym: No.

577
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,280
Rym: As a kid, I hated the letter pages.

578
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,840
Rym: The letter page was, ah, the comic ended.

579
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,960
Rym: I only got like four pages of comic and I got this ad and a letter page.

580
00:30:10,061 --> 00:30:10,276
Rym: Great.

581
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,980
Scott: Letter pages are good, positive and negative points.

582
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:15,420
Scott: Right.

583
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:19,940
Scott: And you know, some of the letter page stuff in here is good and some of it's not so good.

584
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,766
Scott: You know, it's when they can do.

585
00:30:21,806 --> 00:30:25,800
Scott: a funny answer is when it's good and I feel like they're printing too many of the letters.

586
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,459
Scott: I feel like they should print less of them.

587
00:30:27,842 --> 00:30:29,198
Rym: Or just a hundred percent fake them.

588
00:30:30,546 --> 00:30:31,160
Rym: I don't know if they're fake.

589
00:30:31,303 --> 00:30:31,640
Rym: Are they real?

590
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:37,519
Scott: Uh, I mean, as far as I can tell, they're, they're, they're probably real, right?

591
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:44,299
Scott: I don't know if they, they've always been real throughout history, but letter pages are definitely mostly, if not completely real.

592
00:30:44,882 --> 00:30:50,319
Scott: Uh, so anyway, so yeah, it's a, what else is there to say about it?

593
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,418
Rym: I mean, I liked it.

594
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,017
Scott: It's hot.

595
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:59,720
Scott: If you want to read a superhero comic, that's also quite humorous, but has a modern sensibility.

596
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:12,416
Rym: I guess if you've never read the weird old nineties, like kind of gross quote unquote edgy comics or read them, you can read the score girl trade because I was moderately entertained by it.

597
00:31:13,283 --> 00:31:16,480
Rym: No, the thing is what it really struggled to finish.

598
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,759
Scott: It just, it felt like a chore.

599
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,480
Rym: Just what it really put into stark contrast.

600
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:21,278
Rym: Get it?

601
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:28,640
Rym: Stark Tony Stark is how unfunny Deadpool is except in the smallest of doses.

602
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:39,739
Rym: So Deadpool is pretty great if you get like one to three pages of Deadpool inside of something else, but just Deadpool, how could you?

603
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,196
Scott: So here's the thing, right?

604
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,360
Scott: It's like Deadpool himself is not funny or unfunny, right?

605
00:31:45,440 --> 00:32:01,800
Scott: Is that when you have superhero comics, there's so many different writers out there and even though it's the same nominally still Deadpool, the Deadpool in the first Deadpool comic and the Deadpool in a different Deadpool comic written by someone else are basically completely different characters, right?

606
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,800
Scott: They have nothing to do with each other.

607
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:09,258
Scott: So if you read like, you know, the very first Deadpool, it's like he's actually way serious and not a joke.

608
00:32:10,201 --> 00:32:14,380
Scott: And if you read a Deadpool written by like Dan Slott, who's really hilarious.

609
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,140
Scott: I don't know if he's ever written any Deadpools, but he's like way hilarious.

610
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:19,240
Scott: It would probably be way hilarious.

611
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:25,140
Scott: Like if you read, there's a comic from the early two thousands, like Cable and Deadpool, that comic is way funny.

612
00:32:26,023 --> 00:32:28,536
Scott: At least it was way funny for a high school college brain of me.

613
00:32:29,721 --> 00:32:34,699
Rym: Well, cause there was a weird mystique around cable when I was in like middle school.

614
00:32:38,941 --> 00:32:39,131
Scott: Right.

615
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:39,919
Scott: It's called Scott brain.

616
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:48,220
Scott: I don't know if it's still funny, but I've read a lot of Deadpool comics that are just crappy toilet humor and aren't funny at all and has nothing to do with the character himself.

617
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,500
Scott: It has to do with the author, right?

618
00:32:50,103 --> 00:32:51,200
Scott: It's the same with anything.

619
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:51,332
Scott: Right?

620
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:58,460
Rym: If you read some, you know, even like look at my little pony, like look at who wrote each episode and you got a good sense how that episode is going to go, right?

621
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:03,459
Scott: So the squirrel girl that's written by Ryan North is the top tier squirrel girl.

622
00:33:04,481 --> 00:33:08,560
Scott: And you know, if it's written by someone else, yep.

623
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,191

635
00:34:37,634 --> 00:34:43,989
Media: I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy.

636
00:34:46,429 --> 00:35:04,130
Media: I urge every member of both parties, Americans of all religions and of all colors, from every section of this country, to join me in that cause.

637
00:35:06,361 --> 00:35:22,160
Media: At times, history and fate meet at a single time, in a single place, to shape a turning point in man's unending search for freedom.

638
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:35,500
Media: So it was at Lexington and Concord, so it was a century ago at Appomattox, so it was just last week in Selma, Alabama.

639
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:47,460
Media: There, long-suffering men and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as Americans.

640
00:35:49,602 --> 00:35:51,880
Media: Many were brutally assaulted.

641
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:58,960
Media: One good man, a man of God, was killed.

642
00:36:00,902 --> 00:36:06,780
Media: There is no cause for pride in what has happened in Selma.

643
00:36:08,242 --> 00:36:17,559
Media: There is no cause for self-satisfaction in the long denial of equal rights of millions of Americans.

644
00:36:18,821 --> 00:36:25,495
Media: But there is cause for hope and for faith in our democracy.

645
00:36:26,537 --> 00:36:28,819
Media: and what is happening here tonight.

646
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:49,600
Media: For the cries of pain and the hymns and protests of oppressed people have summoned into convocation all the majesty of this great government, the government of the greatest nation on earth.

647
00:36:51,282 --> 00:37:04,540
Media: Our mission is at once the oldest and the most basic of this country--to right wrong, to do justice, to serve man.

648
00:37:06,701 --> 00:37:10,660
Media: In our time we have come to live with the moments of great crisis.

649
00:37:12,181 --> 00:37:21,258
Media: Our lives have been marked with debate about great issues--issues of war and peace, issues of prosperity and depression.

650
00:37:22,761 --> 00:37:32,140
Media: But rarely in any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of America itself.

651
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:51,377
Media: Rarely are we met with a challenge--not to our growth or abundance or our welfare or our security, but rather to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved nation.

652
00:37:53,361 --> 00:38:00,440
Media: The issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue.

653
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:20,440
Media: And should we defeat every enemy, and should we double our wealth and conquer the stars and still be unequal to this issue, then we will have failed as a people and as a nation.

654
00:38:21,781 --> 00:38:27,900
Media: For with a country as with a person, what is a man profiting?

655
00:38:29,662 --> 00:38:35,300
Media: If he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul.
