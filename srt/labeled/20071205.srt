1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,117
Scott: It's Wednesday December 5th.

2
00:00:11,518 --> 00:00:12,060
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,321 --> 00:00:14,848
Scott: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,888 --> 00:00:18,929
Scott: We review Samurai Crusader and the bug boy.

5
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:25,378
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,413 --> 00:00:33,976
Rym: You might have noticed yesterday that it wasn't One of our normal episodes.

7
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:35,383
Scott: well it was.

8
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:36,790
Scott: it counted as a normal episode.

9
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:41,743
Scott: It wasn't a special But it was by no means recorded last night as it usually is.

10
00:00:41,884 --> 00:00:44,513
Rym: no and a lot of people have been asking about When it would come.

11
00:00:44,554 --> 00:00:51,603
Rym: and I guess it was the good opportunity because while Scott was home I assume engaging in some sort of erstwhile pursuit though.

12
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:52,165
Rym: Actually.

13
00:00:52,205 --> 00:00:52,707
Rym: I know better.

14
00:00:52,767 --> 00:01:04,068
Rym: He was playing game Very uh let's say interesting game A game that I'm avoiding for reasons that either make the game sound very good or very bad.

15
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:16,330
Rym: to me It's like the best worst game ever so I might stop playing though at least for a while I've been like pointedly avoiding this game Not like World of Warcraft where I want to play it just to tell you all how much I hate it.

16
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,849
Rym: But I really don't want to play this game because I worry about what will happen.

17
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:22,987
Scott: Yeah, something epic as in the olden days.

18
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:24,023
Rym: well I think the word.

19
00:01:24,044 --> 00:01:26,967
Scott: then again I wish I had this game back in the olden days like in high school.

20
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:28,738
Scott: this god This is even the best thing ever.

21
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,484
Scott: so much for sieve.

22
00:01:29,504 --> 00:01:32,955
Rym: - yeah but Where I was.

23
00:01:32,975 --> 00:01:38,470
Rym: I'm not gonna dwell on this because I think I could do a. Sometime when Scott's out of town I'll tell a little story about this.

24
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:47,527
Rym: But I was sipping Bellini's in the Rainbow Room in New York City, and I have to say The Rainbow Room is quite a nut like.

25
00:01:47,627 --> 00:01:57,566
Rym: I imagine I just had this like fast forward future to me ten years from now And we'll have like I don't know the GeekNights after party in the Rainbow Room after some kind.

26
00:01:57,727 --> 00:01:59,131
Scott: the Rainbow Room is not the Nicest.

27
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:01,881
Scott: I mean, it's not an ugly disgusting room or anything, but it's not.

28
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:04,650
Scott: you know like there's nicer rooms not many.

29
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:13,510
Scott: I mean if you ever been up there It's this big circular room And it's got the chandelier in the middle And then it's like you know you can actually if you want if anyone wants to go to the Rainbow Room.

30
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,598
Scott: They have like Fridays and Saturdays.

31
00:02:15,638 --> 00:02:18,148
Scott: You can just pay to go and have dinner and dancing up there.

32
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:22,645
Rym: well remember There's the Rainbow Room, and then there's the Rainbow Bar and Grill on the 65th floor.

33
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:34,535
Rym: Uh-huh, it's not the same thing all right, but yeah, I remember it was Emily and I walk in and we were just handed Bellini's not which is a Champagne cocktail.

34
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:39,310
Rym: all right if you're the kind of person who's like well, I've got champagne, but that's just not enough.

35
00:02:39,734 --> 00:02:45,170
Scott: I gotta mix this with something Maybe because the champagne is actually ass and they need to cover it up.

36
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:52,930
Scott: But you can still say you're drinking champagne So you still feel really awesome like you're high class because my test of any sort of bar or anything like that is one.

37
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:58,114
Rym: I go to the bartender who had probably the third or fourth most awesome mustache I've ever seen.

38
00:02:58,134 --> 00:03:02,950
Rym: uh-huh it was it was magnificent, and it was curled up and waxed.

39
00:03:03,572 --> 00:03:05,998
Rym: Amen, and I said make me a Manhattan.

40
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:11,011
Rym: and he reached for all the proper things in the proper amounts and used a very good Whiskey.

41
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:17,070
Rym: yeah, that's what you get at a fancy place as opposed to say uber con where I got basically a tumbler full of whiskey.

42
00:03:17,232 --> 00:03:17,986
Scott: That's a hotel.

43
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:20,457
Scott: It's an average.

44
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,930
Scott: You know usual hotel not some fancy place.

45
00:03:23,941 --> 00:03:33,558
Rym: But yeah The only thing I really want to say is it was really kind of odd and wonderful to see the Empire State building From a similarly tall build like to see.

46
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:42,710
Rym: you mean about a half as tall building as in to see the Empire State building From a very tall building as opposed to seeing other not as tall buildings from the Empire State building.

47
00:03:43,092 --> 00:03:43,796
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of.

48
00:03:43,816 --> 00:03:50,810
Scott: but the thing is once you've been on the Empire State building It's like well, I guess there are taller buildings in the world, but I guess not in the city anymore.

49
00:03:51,091 --> 00:03:53,378
Rym: Well, I went to the Sears or the CN Tower.

50
00:03:53,939 --> 00:04:00,306
Rym: way the tiles that it's one of the tallest like it was the tallest building In the world until recently, I'll look I'll look I'll look it up.

51
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:02,337
Rym: but You know what?

52
00:04:02,358 --> 00:04:04,413
Rym: The view from the top was Nothing.

53
00:04:04,534 --> 00:04:05,898
Rym: There were a lot of clouds under us.

54
00:04:05,938 --> 00:04:07,303
Rym: I couldn't see a goddamn thing.

55
00:04:07,443 --> 00:04:09,450
Scott: Yeah, that's about how the weather is lately.

56
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:11,822
Rym: Lately, this was like 10 years.

57
00:04:11,882 --> 00:04:14,356
Scott: our looks like a Crappy space needle.

58
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,350
Rym: All right way to malign Canada.

59
00:04:18,411 --> 00:04:19,274
Scott: Take that Canada.

60
00:04:19,515 --> 00:04:22,505
Scott: your CN Tower is a crappy space needle like the CN Tower.

61
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,990
Scott: It doesn't look too good to me.

62
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:25,395
Rym: Have you ever been there?

63
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:30,593
Scott: I think I've seen it from the ground before but I don't think I've ever been in it, uh-huh Right.

64
00:04:30,613 --> 00:04:31,837
Rym: But anyway, it is Wednesday.

65
00:04:31,857 --> 00:04:33,423
Rym: I figure we should talk about anime a little bit.

66
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:34,787
Scott: You mean mostly.

67
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,039
Rym: well You know, we haven't done a show on any anime in a while.

68
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:43,179
Rym: since Scott won't watch eska flown a again I'm not like refusing you.

69
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:45,308
Scott: Hey, it's just what am I gonna watch this?

70
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:45,750
Rym: I don't know.

71
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,460
Rym: Maybe you weren't playing dwarf fortress every day.

72
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:48,560
Rym: Okay.

73
00:04:49,363 --> 00:04:51,270
Scott: I only played it for like three days so far.

74
00:04:51,611 --> 00:04:54,100
Rym: Yes, and you'll have already for went things like sleep.

75
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:55,927
Scott: No, I haven't haven't?

76
00:04:55,987 --> 00:04:56,509
Rym: you know?

77
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:56,810
Rym: I haven't.

78
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,124
Scott: I want to sleep my usual time now.

79
00:04:59,185 --> 00:04:59,850
Rym: What about on the train?

80
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,370
Rym: You could have slept you could have read something but no you were playing dwarf fortress.

81
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,875
Scott: Yeah, I did.

82
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,270
Scott: I have for gone reading comics.

83
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:09,728
Scott: I this is actually the first time where new comics have showed up at the door and there is still old comics that were not Read me.

84
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:20,762
Scott: That's also because this is one of those short months where comics come and then three weeks later comics come Because the week the month before that it was like there was like extra weeks without comics, you know It sort of goes like that.

85
00:05:21,369 --> 00:05:25,563
Rym: now It must be bizarro world because I'm reading comics out of almost the right.

86
00:05:25,603 --> 00:05:29,262
Scott: Scott used to read them and I'm playing PC games And I have Wii games that are unplayed.

87
00:05:29,383 --> 00:05:30,168
Rym: Yeah, what's going on?

88
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,091
Scott: I don't know.

89
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:47,330
Rym: but uh, yeah this weekend as in Friday Saturday and Sunday It is December by the way, so December 7th 8th and 9th We are going to be guests at the New York Anime Festival in the Jacob Javits Javits Center in New York City, New York.

90
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:52,839
Scott: This is actually my news cuz I couldn't find any news and we need to talk about this But we don't want to do a whole episode about it.

91
00:05:53,101 --> 00:05:53,242
Rym: Yeah.

92
00:05:53,282 --> 00:05:56,057
Rym: Well, we'll do a whole episode about it I imagine after it happens.

93
00:05:56,097 --> 00:05:57,484
Scott: Yeah, probably next Wednesday.

94
00:05:57,866 --> 00:06:02,880
Scott: Yeah, great But anyway at the convention we're doing about four events.

95
00:06:03,161 --> 00:06:06,150
Rym: Yeah, just four and we'll have a complimentary four events.

96
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,194
Scott: That's all for well.

97
00:06:07,555 --> 00:06:11,830
Rym: after I think the the epicness of seven seven event ConnectiCon.

98
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:20,169
Rym: Yeah And we're doing a similar amount of Katsucon and the thing is ConnectiCon was all like panels Katsucon Everything we're doing is like a main event.

99
00:06:22,612 --> 00:06:23,875
Rym: Yeah, we'll have more about that.

100
00:06:24,236 --> 00:06:29,650
Rym: Katsucon suffice to say is probably going to be the greatest live thing we have ever done.

101
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:36,337
Rym: All right, but until then I think the New York Anime Festival is going to be one of the greatest things live We've ever done baby.

102
00:06:36,518 --> 00:06:38,170
Scott: All right, do you add a little schedule for us?

103
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,579
Scott: I think Friday at 3 like as soon as the.

104
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:42,125
Scott: I think the con opens to the public.

105
00:06:42,145 --> 00:06:45,758
Scott: at 2 and at 3 the first Panel is at least in one of the rooms.

106
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,689
Scott: is us doing the gecky got panel without the prawn.

107
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:50,770
Rym: Yeah It's gonna be pretty much the same panel.

108
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,857
Rym: We did it Oda khan only without Gerald.

109
00:06:53,058 --> 00:06:58,091
Scott: more more like the one we did at ConnectiCon more educational less Rapetastic.

110
00:06:58,332 --> 00:07:00,781
Rym: Yes, I believe rape tacular is the word I was using.

111
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:02,970
Rym: All right, and that's gonna be fun.

112
00:07:03,071 --> 00:07:04,201
Rym: Scott made a little powerful.

113
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:05,210
Rym: Well, not really a PowerPoint.

114
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:12,430
Rym: I made a Google presentation and we might we might act out a scene from one of our favorite gecky.

115
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,257
Scott: I'm pretty sure we're going to as we did before.

116
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:14,820
Scott: Yeah.

117
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:16,466
Rym: Well, it depends on what scene.

118
00:07:16,707 --> 00:07:19,539
Scott: Yeah, it's true Not a rape tastic scene.

119
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:28,174
Scott: Actually, that's it for Friday Which is probably good because we're gonna spend a lot of time getting stuff set up talking to people Out of the blue.

120
00:07:28,274 --> 00:07:39,064
Rym: it turns out that three very long-standing and most excellent friends are going to kind of randomly be at the car Alrighty, so we're gonna get to see you not then we're gonna get to see.

121
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:42,961
Rym: I know we're gonna get to see C square at least half of C squared.

122
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:44,790
Scott: Hey, you got David Joel gonna be there.

123
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:55,110
Rym: Yep, Dave and Joel a fast karate for the gentleman are actually it's kind of weird Like we're guests of the con and Dave and Joel are guests of us of the con.

124
00:07:55,732 --> 00:08:02,109
Rym: So theoretically, I guess they're at our beck and call since we control their badges But I don't think we're gonna make them do anything.

125
00:08:03,175 --> 00:08:06,289
Scott: I think we'll make them maybe sit at our table when we're not sitting at it.

126
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:14,012
Rym: Yeah But Emily will also be at the table and she'll have the t-shirt designs that are probably going to be finalized somewhat in the near future Mm-hmm.

127
00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:24,482
Rym: So if anyone really really wants to see the I don't know upcoming swag of GeekNights and maybe talk to the artist herself And get some feedback in before we actually send them to print now's your chance.

128
00:08:24,923 --> 00:08:27,050
Rym: Alrighty, but yeah, that's it.

129
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:27,793
Rym: We'll be hanging out.

130
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,139
Rym: Just come to our artist alley table.

131
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,064
Rym: You can't miss.

132
00:08:30,164 --> 00:08:37,870
Scott: I mean the con goes to a 945 on Friday, I think so the and I think like after it's like 645.

133
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,198
Scott: There are no events except for cosplay stuff.

134
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:42,868
Rym: So we'll just be wandering interview and hanging out.

135
00:08:43,249 --> 00:08:45,659
Scott: Yep But yeah, we have an table by the way.

136
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:47,246
Rym: Yes, you can miss it.

137
00:08:47,627 --> 00:09:03,869
Rym: Yeah, but Saturday from 3 to 4 We will have in anime fandom panel room 1 a 0 7 the anime match game, which was made Known at Katsucon last year and made famous at ConnectiCon last year.

138
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:17,979
Scott: Yeah, and immediately following that in the same exact room is the GeekNights live podcast Which is not something we usually do but the the Khan organizing guy requested we Record an episode of the show at the Khan as an event.

139
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:26,886
Rym: and also what I like about this is usually cons always make us Do the do a panel about podcasting and what podcasting is and talk about podcasting, but this isn't that.

140
00:09:26,906 --> 00:09:28,653
Rym: this is just gonna be us Doing a show.

141
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:29,678
Rym: it will happen to be live.

142
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,342
Scott: Yeah.

143
00:09:30,543 --> 00:09:33,396
Scott: I don't know we're gonna talk about though I think it's gonna be pretty fun.

144
00:09:33,436 --> 00:09:36,630
Rym: I mean we how rarely do we have a live studio audience?

145
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,519
Rym: That's more than just like Emily and Alex.

146
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:39,524
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

147
00:09:39,585 --> 00:09:45,745
Scott: But I would much rather Do you know a panel where I'm educating the audience about something specific like the a panel?

148
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:47,230
Scott: but oh well take what you can get.

149
00:09:47,852 --> 00:09:55,598
Rym: And also on Sunday from noon to 1 we'll be doing the video game match game Same as the anime match game.

150
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,643
Rym: only the answers are all be.

151
00:09:56,663 --> 00:10:01,290
Scott: I don't know Mario You know, I mean usually we do a match game for two hours.

152
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,541
Scott: So instead of that we're doing two one-hour match games.

153
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:04,627
Scott: I guess that's just as good.

154
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:14,053
Rym: Yep And for the video game match game I think most of the celebrity panelists are going to be people such as Dave Riley Joel white.

155
00:10:14,174 --> 00:10:17,245
Scott: Yeah, cuz I mean this is an anime convention first and foremost.

156
00:10:17,265 --> 00:10:18,450
Scott: I mean it has other stuff going on.

157
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:27,309
Rym: Yeah, I mean they're providing a bunch of celebrities for the anime match game and they said well We can get you people for the video game match game, but I don't know how video game they'll be.

158
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,645
Scott: Yeah, we need them to be video game or else.

159
00:10:29,665 --> 00:10:36,878
Rym: It doesn't work though I will say I I cannot confirm 100% because she hasn't finalized it But she was very interested.

160
00:10:37,301 --> 00:10:43,590
Rym: at least one of these celebrities We're going to have for the anime match game is none other than Lisa Ortiz the voice of Lena inverse.

161
00:10:43,938 --> 00:10:45,655
Rym: Uh-huh She is one of those like.

162
00:10:46,297 --> 00:10:59,443
Rym: it's funny if I went back to myself when I was in high school and watching anime and said Dude, you're gonna be running an event as a guest at a con where the voice actors of Lena cuz you know I watched dubs back then is gonna be on your game show.

163
00:10:59,483 --> 00:11:00,487
Rym: I wouldn't have believed myself.

164
00:11:00,608 --> 00:11:01,109
Rym: But here we go.

165
00:11:01,732 --> 00:11:04,363
Rym: I'm gonna try to interview her aside from having her on the thing.

166
00:11:04,383 --> 00:11:10,566
Scott: All right, whatever Voice actors, I mean like English voice actors really don't excite me like when I go to a con.

167
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:11,570
Rym: nothing excites you.

168
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,794
Rym: You're just down and glue things.

169
00:11:12,814 --> 00:11:14,340
Rym: You exactly my room ain't so great.

170
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,022
Scott: Oh, it isn't.

171
00:11:15,183 --> 00:11:17,270
Rym: dub actors ain't so great cons ain't so great.

172
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,537
Rym: I don't like doing my panels.

173
00:11:18,658 --> 00:11:26,865
Scott: I guess it's like, you know, I don't look at them the way I look at some other famous people where they're like, oh my god amazing, you know, but I look at them like hey They're just normal cool people hanging out.

174
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:27,189
Scott: What's up?

175
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,043
Rym: Well, I very specifically said my high school self back when it was.

176
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:32,949
Rym: I guess anime was a bigger deal to me.

177
00:11:33,331 --> 00:11:35,216
Scott: Yeah, yeah, my high school self.

178
00:11:35,577 --> 00:11:36,399
Scott: I wasn't see.

179
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:44,129
Scott: that's the thing is until like very relatively very recently I didn't even think about the people who made anything I liked and I didn't care about them at all.

180
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:47,763
Scott: Like I didn't know directors or actors or authors or anything, huh?

181
00:11:48,285 --> 00:11:49,370
Rym: Oh, yeah, we can't forget.

182
00:11:50,512 --> 00:11:54,510
Rym: It appears that Daryl Surratt is going to be at the New York anime festival.

183
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,903
Scott: I think he has a press pass doesn't he I?

184
00:11:57,064 --> 00:12:03,589
Rym: well the thing is if you're a guest of the con, there's a facility where the press can request interviews if you can sense.

185
00:12:03,609 --> 00:12:08,322
Rym: and Daryl Surratt being cheeky requested an interview with us.

186
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:10,810
Scott: Well, he said he was gonna do it and he did it worked.

187
00:12:11,212 --> 00:12:12,521
Rym: So I got an email from the con.

188
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:18,106
Rym: They're like, yeah this News-outlet called anime world order wants to have an interview with you.

189
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:19,030
Rym: Are you cool with that?

190
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:20,755
Scott: Yeah, I think it was.

191
00:12:20,977 --> 00:12:23,450
Scott: it was cool to do this just to see how the system worked.

192
00:12:23,731 --> 00:12:30,650
Scott: You know cuz if you're press at some convention, you know, and you want to enter, you know Get some time special with one of the guests or something.

193
00:12:30,831 --> 00:12:36,594
Rym: Well, I think the real answer there is that Daryl Surratt wants some special time with you With me.

194
00:12:37,318 --> 00:12:38,624
Scott: I think he was with both of us.

195
00:12:38,644 --> 00:12:41,836
Rym: See the thing is I'm not worried about.

196
00:12:41,957 --> 00:12:45,810
Rym: I don't know clown pistols because he's flying here and the TSA.

197
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,170
Scott: I'm trusting the TSA to take his clown pistols away.

198
00:12:50,453 --> 00:12:51,804
Scott: We'll see how that come on TSA.

199
00:12:51,824 --> 00:12:52,368
Scott: Don't let me down.

200
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:55,053
Rym: Those are famous.

201
00:12:55,094 --> 00:13:00,230
Scott: last words, yeah, I know right but yeah, of course we aren't taking any airplanes.

202
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,194
Scott: We could easily get some clown pistols there.

203
00:13:02,294 --> 00:13:02,875
Rym: clown pistols.

204
00:13:02,895 --> 00:13:04,098
Rym: I'm thinking Roman candles.

205
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:07,043
Scott: It's all you It's all you.

206
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:11,920
Rym: but yeah other than that we're gonna be interviewing people and hanging out and I think it's gonna be a fun time.

207
00:13:12,121 --> 00:13:20,078
Scott: Yeah, I've heard some interesting, you know I've gathered lots of information about this con over over a while and I'm not sure what to make of it all.

208
00:13:20,138 --> 00:13:25,020
Scott: and you know The con, you know in all honesty, this is not guaranteed to be some amazing convention.

209
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,773
Scott: But again, it is not guaranteed to be some epic fail terrible convention either.

210
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:30,800
Rym: It's a new thing if they're trying something.

211
00:13:31,482 --> 00:13:42,540
Scott: It's very interesting if you look at the history of geek conventions in New York City and they like the What happened with the Big Apple Anime Festival and you look at what happened with these people in the New York Comic Con?

212
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:50,180
Rym: But then you look at the people they've got running this con and you look at I mean Compare the first New York Comic Con where basically it was epic failure.

213
00:13:50,665 --> 00:13:58,080
Scott: I see you look at all these factors And it's like you got this mountain of positive factors a mountain of negative factors and a mountain of unknown factors.

214
00:13:58,825 --> 00:14:04,913
Rym: I think the positive out ways of a rationale is The epic failure of the New York Comic Con.

215
00:14:04,994 --> 00:14:08,780
Scott: the two years ago is something No one could possibly be dumb enough to repeat.

216
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,081
Scott: Well,

217
00:14:09,121 --> 00:14:26,378
Rym: no because when they ran the New York Comic Con the following year while it's not my kind of con Just cuz I don't I'm not the kind of person who enjoys a Comic Con they ran that thing pretty freaking amazingly Yeah, and a lot of people showed up and it went really really well.

218
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:37,337
Scott: Yep Well, I think that No matter what happens at this con everything we do as long as it happens and doesn't get like canceled or moved or anything we'll be awesome because I guarantee that.

219
00:14:37,358 --> 00:14:43,702
Scott: and Second of all, I think it's going to be very interesting to see what happens Cuz.

220
00:14:43,762 --> 00:14:48,740
Scott: yeah, I'm very I'm very curious as to see how it's gonna go down and I think it'll actually be exciting.

221
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:59,152
Scott: We're usually I go to an anime con and it's only the expected typical thing from an anime con, you know Like you know what I expect to see is what I see but I think at this con I'm gonna see some things that I haven't seen.

222
00:14:59,373 --> 00:15:12,394
Rym: well, honestly more and more I think And that's why we're trying to do something a little different at Katsu con Just in terms of all anime cons kind of with the exception of Florida I guess are all the same like they all have their own character.

223
00:15:12,414 --> 00:15:13,297
Rym: like every kind of zone.

224
00:15:13,337 --> 00:15:19,220
Rym: things like Anime Central always had the awesome opening ceremonies and the best con suite in the history of cons.

225
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:28,918
Rym: But like Otakon was just awesome and gigantic and Katsu con has like people our age hanging out in the bar and just a very different vibe.

226
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:34,857
Rym: and like Animasements very like you get to hang out with the super big-name Japanese voice actors and directors.

227
00:15:34,937 --> 00:15:36,907
Scott: as long as you're cool Cuz they're well, they're just.

228
00:15:36,947 --> 00:15:39,160
Rym: they're walking around and it's very chill and awesome.

229
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:44,240
Rym: But like every cons different in that regard, but in terms of programming, they're all identical.

230
00:15:44,341 --> 00:15:52,279
Rym: They got the cosplay and they got this and they got that in a bunch of fans mostly identical In terms of you never get see something unexpected at an anime con.

231
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:53,164
Scott: That's super.

232
00:15:53,184 --> 00:15:54,672
Scott: not at least not if you've been to one before.

233
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,140
Scott: you've never been to one before.

234
00:15:56,261 --> 00:15:58,435
Scott: I don't know if this is a good one to go to.

235
00:15:58,576 --> 00:16:01,339
Rym: Oh God Remember our first Otakon?

236
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,560
Scott: I guess if this is the only one you can go to and you've never been to one before I guess it couldn't hurt.

237
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,804
Scott: But don't like.

238
00:16:08,225 --> 00:16:11,476
Scott: take what happens here as an impression of what all anime cons are like.

239
00:16:11,536 --> 00:16:23,180
Rym: because I'm who knows I think that anime cons need to I don't know diversify Branch out a little bit and like katsu-kan and Otakon each one of them should have something that really makes him stand out.

240
00:16:23,581 --> 00:16:37,573
Scott: I think so, too, but I'm worried that someone will come to this and who knows what it'll be like, you know it could be who knows it's all over the map and They'll take that experience positive or negative and sort of apply that to you know And assume other anime cons are the same way.

241
00:16:37,593 --> 00:16:41,579
Scott: and I know for one thing Good or bad to say this con will be different from all others.

242
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:48,742
Rym: See that's not a concern at all because think about how many people have never even heard of Otakon Like.

243
00:16:48,762 --> 00:16:53,540
Rym: the only reason Otakon doesn't have problems with attendance is just because they kind of don't advertise.

244
00:16:54,023 --> 00:16:56,256
Scott: Yeah, this play this these people are out to make a profit.

245
00:16:56,296 --> 00:16:56,940
Scott: That's the other thing.

246
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:05,422
Scott: So the people running this con Otakon is by fans for fans, which has its pros and cons yeah, and this get on pros and Con.

247
00:17:05,603 --> 00:17:08,073
Scott: oh, yeah, and this convention is by a company.

248
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:18,079
Scott: read exhibitions when that company all they do is run conventions of various kinds in order to make money and The industry is all over this con the anime industry the manga industry and whatever.

249
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,733
Rym: But at the same time the US manga.

250
00:17:19,753 --> 00:17:19,795
Scott: at

251
00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:37,167
Rym: the same time Peter who we were working with who kind of got us on board with this whole shindig very much was doing his research about how fan anime cons are run and there's a very good possibility that this con is basically going to have the weight of Professionals who care about like.

252
00:17:37,187 --> 00:17:48,554
Rym: they have a vested interest in the con going well coupled with Actually doing things that they think the fans alike as opposed to I don't know Anime Expo, which I've never really heard a lot of good things about.

253
00:17:48,594 --> 00:17:50,080
Scott: now it all I can say.

254
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:58,711
Scott: This is gonna be really interesting and I'm incredibly curious and actually sort of like excited to go to this con and see what goes Down where his other cons is sort of like going to a con.

255
00:17:58,751 --> 00:18:01,160
Scott: This one's like, oh man, so what's gonna go down?

256
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:02,240
Scott: Let's see.

257
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,893
Rym: So I have some actual anime news here and holy crap really.

258
00:18:07,094 --> 00:18:10,994
Rym: now the the moral I'm gonna let you all listen to this story.

00:18:11,014 --> 00:18:13,165

00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:36,586
Scott: so yeah And who knows how true this is.

269

288
00:19:55,593 --> 00:20:03,790
Rym: as some of you may know Anime wallpapers calm was started by Philip Mac PMAC Way back in the year 2000.

289
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,300
Scott: It was and that was the site to go to for anime wallpapers.

290
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,480
Scott: I mean, he didn't have a lot of wallpapers and he sort of posted them manually and people submitted them.

291
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,260
Scott: But he had him there organized by show and he had some quality ones.

292
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,866
Scott: There weren't any really ugly ones there.

293
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:19,820
Rym: since that time it has grown to be the largest anime wallpapers site.

294
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,883
Scott: It's pretty much the only Site that consists.

295
00:20:22,943 --> 00:20:26,032
Scott: that I found that consists solely of anime wallpapers.

296
00:20:26,052 --> 00:20:28,660
Scott: That's well organized easy to use and generally high quality.

297
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:35,244
Rym: Unfortunately on February 13th PMAC passed away.

298
00:20:35,766 --> 00:20:37,451
Rym: how it was very sudden.

299
00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:38,253
Rym: Uh-huh.

300
00:20:38,855 --> 00:20:40,540
Rym: See now this is actually a whole aside.

301
00:20:40,601 --> 00:20:43,761
Rym: I think we should do a Monday's show on We're.

302
00:20:44,163 --> 00:20:44,483
Rym: we're getting.

303
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:56,010
Rym: we're at a point in the world where a lot of people create a lot of content and do a lot of business II things without Companies or lawyers or business II stuff.

304
00:20:56,873 --> 00:20:59,120
Rym: and like when we die, we're gonna die someday.

305
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,651
Rym: Well, at least Scott's gonna die.

306
00:21:00,913 --> 00:21:09,040
Rym: Yeah Put my brain right after him dies, are we gonna be like Thomas Jefferson and Adams when Adams dies?

307
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,903
Rym: He's like damn it.

308
00:21:10,165 --> 00:21:13,920
Rym: Jefferson still lives but Jefferson had died like five minutes before anyway.

309
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:19,386
Rym: So when people like us die What happens to GeekNights?

310
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:21,876
Rym: No one has the passwords but me and Scott.

311
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:22,980
Rym: No one has the accounts.

312
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,603
Rym: No one has any.

313
00:21:23,663 --> 00:21:24,426
Scott: a lot of the things.

314
00:21:24,487 --> 00:21:25,712
Scott: no one has the passwords with me.

315
00:21:26,174 --> 00:21:30,576
Rym: Yeah, and then vice versa There's some things I have control over like all the archives.

316
00:21:30,837 --> 00:21:38,260
Rym: Yeah Anyway, but that's an interesting question and a lot of those issues kind of come up in this continuing press release to allow me to.

317
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:42,115
Rym: I don't think I'll interrupt anymore until the end because otherwise I'll never get through this.

318
00:21:42,136 --> 00:21:49,199
Rym: Mm-hmm it was all very sudden and the multitude of sites that he was running went down as the server payment stopped.

319
00:21:49,219 --> 00:21:57,898
Rym: a server admin Hong Lee who was helping him manage the systems was able to back up most of his content and set the sites up on a new server.

320
00:21:58,724 --> 00:22:12,433
Rym: When P Mac's mother contacted Hong Lee about her son's estate He decided that this was a prime opportunity And using his access to fake emails from P Mac to go daddy and Moved most of the domain names and sites that P Mac was running over to a nom.

321
00:22:12,453 --> 00:22:15,404
Rym: I Guess these are all forum names.

322
00:22:15,826 --> 00:22:24,100
Rym: Yeah, Hong Lee has posted in this forum as foobar widget Pretending he had a legitimate claim to the sites also.

323
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,020
Rym: Unfortunately during that time P Mac and I were not on speaking terms.

324
00:22:28,341 --> 00:22:32,000
Rym: I thought he was - anyway due to the anime lyric situation.

325
00:22:32,201 --> 00:22:35,159
Rym: I wonder what the anime lyric situation was.

326
00:22:35,947 --> 00:22:37,080
Scott: people with their drama.

327
00:22:39,121 --> 00:22:43,900
Rym: People fail with their drama, but I do want to point out does anyone else remember sailor bacon?

328
00:22:44,121 --> 00:22:45,788
Rym: Which is that was a creepy.

329
00:22:45,829 --> 00:22:46,753
Scott: It sounds familiar.

330
00:22:47,014 --> 00:22:52,340
Rym: sailor bacon was a creepy, dude But he ran a website that was really the only place to get lyrics to anime songs back in the day.

331
00:22:52,440 --> 00:23:00,464
Rym: I remember that yeah sailor bacon as far as I could tell was a cross-dressing like Sailor Moon guide something I saw pictures of him.

332
00:23:00,685 --> 00:23:01,547
Scott: I'm looking it up right now.

333
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:02,029
Rym: Yeah.

334
00:23:02,129 --> 00:23:03,994
Rym: Anyway to continue.

335
00:23:04,034 --> 00:23:13,024
Rym: I don't know if this involved sailor bacon or not So my first knowledge of any of this came with the post from Hong Lee Being the suspicious kind.

336
00:23:13,445 --> 00:23:22,839
Rym: I reached out to a few business partners of P Max whom I knew from our past dealings and was eventually Able to piece together what had happened Despite our differences of opinion here.

337
00:23:23,141 --> 00:23:28,540
Rym: He was a friend of mine and it's also simply not right for his mother to have to be fighting a legal battle over the worker.

338
00:23:28,682 --> 00:23:38,620
Rym: son spent most of his life on princess Minako and I Felt that we had to reach out to his mother and offer any kind of support we could try to correct the situation.

339
00:23:39,421 --> 00:23:42,269
Rym: Both go daddy and anon weren't interested in helping.

340
00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:47,905
Rym: as domains removed from one register to another and on was hiding his identity Behind their who is protection service.

341
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:51,857
Rym: each registrar simply pointed us back and forth yada yada yada.

342
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:52,800
Rym: He couldn't get the domains.

343
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:56,491
Rym: We spent most of the summer dealing with the registrar's.

344
00:23:56,652 --> 00:24:08,968
Rym: after being contacted by our lawyer Hong Lee decided to register get anime wallpapers calm and redirect all the anime wallpapers calm traffic there Thus pretty much ruining the status of the domain.

345
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,919
Scott: if he if he had the domain, why didn't he just?

346
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,180
Scott: Move the domain like just point the domain directly at the server.

347
00:24:16,241 --> 00:24:18,117
Scott: Why do you have to see name and that I don't get it?

348
00:24:18,742 --> 00:24:20,757
Rym: I can think of a few ways for SEO purposes.

349
00:24:20,777 --> 00:24:26,492
Rym: But anyway In the end we felt we had at least enough ground to file a motion with.

350
00:24:26,613 --> 00:24:28,919
Rym: I can and try to recover the domain name.

351
00:24:29,921 --> 00:24:33,295
Rym: After about a month I can rule than our favor blah blah blah.

352
00:24:33,316 --> 00:24:37,507
Rym: They got the domain back After going through this and finally recovering the names.

353
00:24:37,908 --> 00:24:38,911
Rym: kitty p mags.

354
00:24:38,972 --> 00:24:53,618
Rym: mother was very kind and offering the domains to me with a very fair offer in the hopes that we can continue to build the site the way that her son would have wanted it as Opposed to going with an ad agency which could have paid her a larger sum but would likely have been unable to maintain the site correctly.

355
00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:57,452
Rym: as Hong Lee was also running anime lyrics TV.

356
00:24:57,472 --> 00:25:03,724
Rym: I Just wonder if one of these people is sailor bacon or even remember what happened to that guy Mmm, and because

357
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,667
Scott: we did send you a link

358
00:25:04,989 --> 00:25:12,678
Rym: that having two sites with nearly duplicate content was unwieldy We took control of that domain as well and is currently being redirected to anime lyrics.

359
00:25:12,939 --> 00:25:25,286
Rym: calm Right now I'm not I'm gonna skip the rest of this but that was posted by Igor bass aka kaito ace and I guess princess monaco Uh-huh.

360
00:25:25,508 --> 00:25:28,700
Rym: Yeah now wheel of morality.

361
00:25:30,006 --> 00:25:30,879
Rym: Don't have drama.

362
00:25:31,241 --> 00:25:37,379
Rym: Why does every freaking anime like fansite community every anime website even half the staff of anime cons?

363
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:37,580
Rym: because?

364
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,252
Rym: Being on the mailing list of a lot of anime con staff.

365
00:25:40,634 --> 00:25:41,740
Rym: There's a lot of drama.

366
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:52,080
Rym: You'd be surprised like how much bullshit drama there is among the staff of almost every anime con ever People except probably the New York Anime Festival because they're all paid professionals.

367
00:25:52,501 --> 00:26:01,095
Scott: Yes, if someone's not acting professionally drama will happen and most people, you know They're just you know doing things as friends and then they're not winners.

368
00:26:01,175 --> 00:26:02,340
Scott: So that's kind of thing happens.

369
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:08,420
Rym: But why is it such like the anime manga video game role-playing like all day?

370
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,100
Scott: That's just where we notice that the drama happens in all in all different communities.

371
00:26:12,221 --> 00:26:29,953
Rym: maybe it's just because these communities have a lot of Content creation and a lot of I guess undisclosed or verbal contract agreements that aren't very enforceable that a lot of people seem to Fight over like well, I control the anime club now because I blah blah blah.

372
00:26:29,973 --> 00:26:32,039
Rym: I just don't get how there can be drama.

373
00:26:33,161 --> 00:26:35,351
Scott: Stupid people the drama happens.

374
00:26:35,391 --> 00:26:36,577
Scott: That's that's the rule the universe.

375
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:39,838
Scott: if no one was stupid There'd be no drama because everyone would just do what needs to get done.

376
00:26:39,878 --> 00:26:40,080
Scott: BAM.

377
00:26:40,462 --> 00:26:51,900
Rym: Now if you follow this link, I'd like to point out that there are two posts after what he said and I want you to look at the signature to content ratio.

378
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,620
Scott: Yeah of these posts I could talk about that in general.

379
00:26:56,001 --> 00:26:57,526
Scott: What is up with people on forums?

380
00:26:57,566 --> 00:27:01,780
Scott: at the gigantic signatures like full of images and crazy animations and whatnot?

381
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,202
Scott: You know what?

382
00:27:02,222 --> 00:27:04,033
Scott: What do you what are you thinking when you're doing that?

383
00:27:04,073 --> 00:27:04,597
Scott: What what do you know?

384
00:27:04,617 --> 00:27:05,100
Rym: what they're thinking?

385
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,328
Rym: They're thinking the same thing.

386
00:27:06,449 --> 00:27:19,377
Rym: I thought in like 1997 when I made Mephistopheles realm which was a ROM site on geocities and I had like 12 animated gifs of fire Everywhere, uh-huh.

387
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:36,280
Rym: and I mean I think it's gonna get to the point where there's gonna be two internets the internet where it's people typing text and saying things to each other and the internet where Every forum post is like a word like maybe plus one or lols and then an entire myspace page as the signature.

388
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,755
Scott: And so it's all gonna be our forum and fortune.

389
00:27:40,016 --> 00:27:48,654
Rym: pretty much Things of the day.

390
00:27:49,196 --> 00:27:51,744
Rym: so I guess because we didn't do a show last night.

391
00:27:51,764 --> 00:27:53,570
Rym: We just put up the old archive episode.

392
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:56,429
Rym: We uh, we both have vidya game things of the day.

393
00:27:57,131 --> 00:28:01,714
Scott: Well, I actually had a whole bunch of things of the day and I thought I had an anime one But I guess it disappeared.

394
00:28:01,815 --> 00:28:05,710
Rym: so so I'll be real brief about this cuz I don't know what much needs to be said.

395
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,758
Rym: Pac-man the text adventure.

396
00:28:08,778 --> 00:28:12,230
Scott: No, no need to make Dig Dug and Pitfall the text adventures.

397
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:22,666
Rym: I've always been a fan of that sort of minimalist text adventure kind of art like Some of you might remember the famous classic pick up the phone booth and die.

398
00:28:22,847 --> 00:28:23,489
Scott: That's a great one.

399
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:26,780
Scott: Everyone should go play pick up the phone booth and die.

400
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,990
Scott: It's the best text adventure there ever was, you know.

401
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:29,935
Rym: I think I have to agree.

402
00:28:29,955 --> 00:28:34,258
Rym: Yeah, but the pack text is a Pretty accurate.

403
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:36,230
Scott: I got as long as you don't cheat ram.

404
00:28:36,894 --> 00:28:42,270
Rym: I turned on debugging mode just to see what was going on And you're the one who encouraged me to cheat and beat it and see what happens.

405
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:44,079
Scott: I tell you to tell you to jump off a bridge.

406
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:45,024
Scott: Does that mean you should do it?

407
00:28:45,346 --> 00:28:46,230
Rym: I've been bungee jumping.

408
00:28:46,495 --> 00:28:53,168
Rym: I'll do it again Without a bungee cord or a parachute Right, so what do you got for me?

409
00:28:53,970 --> 00:29:00,190
Scott: You know, you know how Southeast Asian and I guess the rest of the world in general they like their knockoffs.

410
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:05,011
Scott: You know, they get their knockoff iPods or knockoff iPhones or knockoff Ps3.

411
00:29:05,553 --> 00:29:09,786
Rym: well, we know how well that's been going in South Korea with the knockoff cell phone batteries.

412
00:29:10,027 --> 00:29:10,870
Scott: Yeah, great.

413
00:29:11,372 --> 00:29:14,784
Scott: Well, of course, there are knockoff wheeze many many of them.

414
00:29:14,845 --> 00:29:16,290
Rym: Well, I knock my we off regularly.

415
00:29:16,792 --> 00:29:30,359
Scott: Yeah, so there's one particular one in China called the VV II the V and I got two links concerning the V. the first link concerning the V is a TV commercial.

416
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,930
Scott: it's actually more of an infomercial.

417
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:40,843
Scott: it's pretty long telling you to call this number to get your V now and it shows picked all these people playing the V and It's actually a pretty impressive commercial.

418
00:29:40,883 --> 00:29:51,370
Scott: like it's professionally done it's like a real deal infomercial going on here to tell you to buy the V. and Well, I don't know if anyone's actually gonna buy it thinking it's the Wii.

419
00:29:52,474 --> 00:29:53,810
Scott: They probably know it's a knockoff.

420
00:29:53,912 --> 00:29:54,684
Scott: I can't imagine how.

421
00:29:55,372 --> 00:29:59,450
Scott: Yes, maybe if you're just totally clueless when it came to video games you might buy it by accident.

422
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:05,603
Scott: But you know, I guess it's it's a system that works and they're showing you Actual footage from the V and not the Wii.

423
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:07,715
Scott: so all right The sec.

424
00:30:07,735 --> 00:30:09,770
Scott: that's just to give you an idea of what the V is all about.

425
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,736
Scott: The second link is the real thing of the day.

426
00:30:11,756 --> 00:30:31,879
Scott: in gadget the greatest website for tech news apparent currently, I guess Has a Chinese branch in gadget China and they got a V and this video Shows in gadget China opening up the V to see what's inside the V and what's inside the V is hilarious.

427
00:30:31,899 --> 00:30:36,760
Scott: and In gadget China's reaction to what's inside the V is hilarious.

428
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:44,970
Rym: the noise they make when they actually get the cover off and see it Is is priceless and seeing what's in there also priceless.

429
00:30:46,154 --> 00:30:51,890
Scott: so yeah you You know, it's one thing to see a knock a commercial for a knockoff game system.

430
00:30:51,952 --> 00:30:52,589
Scott: That's just blatant.

431
00:30:53,075 --> 00:30:59,890
Scott: It's another thing to see You know to sort of pull back the covers and see what's really inside that knockoff game system, right?

432
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:10,430
Rym: So we used to do this way Way back in the early days of GeekNights where Scott and I would each review something and it didn't always work So well, we always ended up either going really long or going really short on something.

433
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:19,090
Scott: And it was also sort of bland because instead of a show where both of us were talking back and forth It was one person talks a bunch then the other person talks a bunch and it wasn't really so exciting.

434
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:23,250
Rym: But I think we found the way around all this in that one thing we tend to do.

435
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:35,676
Rym: We tend to seem to have a pension for whenever we're at a comic store or at a con If there's cheap manga or cheap comics the cheaper they are the more likely we are to buy them and content is not a factor Something like that.

436
00:31:35,697 --> 00:31:39,456
Scott: I mean if you're selling me the worst You're selling me MD guys.

437
00:31:39,516 --> 00:31:40,440
Scott: I'll buy for a dollar.

438
00:31:40,681 --> 00:31:41,806
Scott: Yeah, it'll happen.

439
00:31:42,088 --> 00:31:45,065
Scott: Just because I Unless I've got it already.

440
00:31:45,085 --> 00:31:46,649
Scott: if I've got it already I'm not gonna buy it.

441
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:51,930
Scott: But if even if it's the worst thing in the world if you sell, you know I'll buy it I guess I wouldn't buy like a hentai or something.

442
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:57,738
Scott: But if there's any reason to have it at all and the price is low enough I'll eventually if it's one cent.

443
00:31:58,562 --> 00:32:03,386
Scott: if you got a manga for one cent it's rare the manga that I won't buy for one cent.

444
00:32:03,406 --> 00:32:07,118
Rym: and We read these occasionally.

445
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:09,810
Rym: usually they just pile up then we give them away at cons or something.

446
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:16,630
Rym: But for whatever reason I ended up reading the thing Scott's gonna talk about and it actually was good.

447
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:21,337
Rym: We both avoided reading it because it looked kind of bad But it was actually kind of good.

448
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:25,090
Scott: and then Rym bought a manga recently and I sort of read it.

449
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:25,813
Scott: No, he read it.

450
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:29,430
Rym: Totally I bought it based on one thing and one thing alone.

451
00:32:29,611 --> 00:32:31,701
Scott: I cannot blame you for buying it based on that one thing.

452
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:32,746
Rym: It was kind of expensive.

453
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:33,570
Rym: It was eight bucks.

454
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:36,365
Rym: That's more than I've paid for a comic in a long time.

455
00:32:36,385 --> 00:32:37,812
Scott: Well, here we talk about it We were at.

456
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:44,257
Scott: we went to Hanley's universe, which is a famous semi-famous comic book store in New York City Right next the Empire State Building.

457
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:46,068
Rym: Oh, yeah, I see the Perry Bible ship.

458
00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:46,309
Rym: God.

459
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:51,050
Scott: Yeah, very Bible fellowship was gonna be there doing a book signing and whatever.

460
00:32:51,173 --> 00:32:57,030
Scott: But you know We sort of wanted to get on the train to do something because we were busy that day and he seemed to show up later.

461
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,942
Rym: Yeah, like it wasn't going we did.

462
00:32:59,002 --> 00:33:00,270
Scott: we did have enough time.

463
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:05,290
Scott: You know if he was on schedule to sort of do go see him and do everything else we needed to do.

464
00:33:05,772 --> 00:33:12,869
Scott: But he was supposed to be there from six to eight and it was six thirty and he wasn't there and there was a line And it wasn't moving and no one was and he wasn't there yet.

465
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:14,054
Scott: So we're like, okay screw this.

466
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:23,170
Scott: but we you know because to the situation we did hang out in Hanley's universe for some minutes And they had I found the road sick Adagio manga.

467
00:33:23,271 --> 00:33:23,391
Rym: They

468
00:33:23,432 --> 00:33:33,361
Scott: had they had a bin of old manga and I was gonna buy a bunch of stuff in there Like they had every volume of wounded man that I did not own already and I might have bought them But they were eight dollars each and I was like what the hell these are.

469
00:33:33,402 --> 00:33:35,350
Scott: buy one get two free at most anime conventions.

470
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,013
Scott: So screw that.

471
00:33:36,154 --> 00:33:41,770
Rym: Yeah, I mean I seriously considered just offer him a hundred bucks for the whole bin Yep, but I don't think they would have gone for that.

472
00:33:41,931 --> 00:33:48,585
Rym: I think they keep that been there mostly just as kind of you know, a lot of old stores They'll have like old Nintendo's and stuff laying around.

473
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:54,414
Rym: they're kind of overpriced But they're more for I don't know browsing and style and making the place like check it out We got the most of.

474
00:33:54,434 --> 00:34:03,970
Scott: the most of the things in that bin were like bent like not bent like all the covers You know has a crease in it But like the whole the whole book is warped and like leaning in one direction also.

475
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:15,257
Scott: It was mostly awful manga the vast majority if it was old awful manga But it was some of the first stuff that was published in the US in English, you know Not the first but some of the first.

476
00:34:15,498 --> 00:34:22,889
Rym: well as Emily pointed out you can always tell because on the back of like every other One they're like from like from the same country that brought you Nausicaa.

477
00:34:23,831 --> 00:34:24,331
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

478
00:34:24,351 --> 00:34:30,009
Scott: they're always because you know, there's very few manga and anime the people in this country actually knew about.

479
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:33,681
Scott: you know They knew about like Ghost in the Shell and Akira and maybe ninjas girl.

480
00:34:33,761 --> 00:34:37,789
Scott: So everything on the back of it was like, yeah We're just like a cure.

481
00:34:37,851 --> 00:34:41,451
Scott: Yeah We're just like ninjas girl by us where we're like that because you know You couldn't.

482
00:34:41,652 --> 00:34:44,705
Scott: there was only so much Akira Ghost in the Shell had in just girl to sell.

483
00:34:44,725 --> 00:34:45,869
Scott: you're gonna run out.

484
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:53,799
Rym: But I picked up I was flipping through and I saw something that looked a lot like sanctuary But obviously wasn't.

485
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:55,710
Scott: maybe because it has the same exact artist.

486
00:34:55,870 --> 00:35:06,233
Rym: Well, yes, and then I look and it is something called samurai crusader the Kumo Maru Chronicles and art by rioichi Ikigami.

487
00:35:06,434 --> 00:35:07,217
Rym: oh him from.

488
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:08,582
Scott: oh, you might know him.

489
00:35:08,743 --> 00:35:09,446
Rym: You may know him.

490
00:35:09,546 --> 00:35:23,076
Scott: Oh, I think you might know him But uh, somebody gonna get a hurt somebody did get hurt real bad Yeah, and it's written by a heroi Oh gee someone who I've never heard of.

491
00:35:23,096 --> 00:35:27,132
Rym: he doesn't even have a Wikipedia page and I wasn't gonna dig deeper and figure out who He was.

492
00:35:27,393 --> 00:35:28,818
Scott: let me check the a9 news network.

493
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:30,706
Rym: All right, but while you're doing that, what's his?

494
00:35:30,846 --> 00:35:31,650
Scott: how do you spell his last name?

495
00:35:32,452 --> 00:35:36,364
Rym: The way I said, oh I JI Oh OJI, okay.

496
00:35:37,026 --> 00:35:37,648
Rym: Oh gee.

497
00:35:37,828 --> 00:35:43,229
Rym: All right All right, all right, but the story here is.

498
00:35:45,192 --> 00:35:46,016
Rym: I got a really.

499
00:35:46,036 --> 00:35:52,329
Rym: I might just have to take you through it a little bit because it's hard to not start cracking up But at the same time I promise it's awesome.

500
00:35:53,611 --> 00:36:10,449
Rym: So it begins with a young man whose name is Kumo Maru and you don't know what the deal is But he's sleeping on top of some sort of gigantic temple somewhere in Japan And he's wearing these pants and these suspenders and they're the most excellent pants I've ever seen.

501
00:36:12,091 --> 00:36:21,150
Rym: They're pretty excellent and suddenly a bunch of monks attack him and he fights them off Epically and I mean very epically and kind of over-the-top Lee.

502
00:36:21,592 --> 00:36:38,470
Rym: but no, they're friends and it turns out the monks raised him and he's this awesome fighting guy and Then it kind of lets you realize that when this is actually set is Japan in the 1920s 1930s, you know like kind of Japan's ascent to the modern world.

503
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:42,010
Rym: But before they ascended to the war like World War two world.

504
00:36:42,531 --> 00:36:50,455
Rym: so, you know economic prosperity and industrialization and all that and there's a lot of style and setting and it's kind of Interesting.

505
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:55,064
Rym: at that point you think all right, there's gonna be some sort of Historical political drama set in 1929 Japan.

506
00:36:57,772 --> 00:36:59,638
Rym: Well, then the robots come.

507
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:02,910
Scott: they look just like the thousand killers from Terminator 2.

508
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:09,150
Scott: They got the same, you know treads for legs triangular tank treads with the chain gun minigun arms.

509
00:37:09,431 --> 00:37:10,800
Scott: it's the same exact freaking thing.

510
00:37:11,222 --> 00:37:17,864
Rym: and then the Nazis and Then more Nazis and then more robots and then cat burglar.

511
00:37:18,145 --> 00:37:19,148
Rym: who is so bad?

512
00:37:19,389 --> 00:37:19,630
Scott: Nazis?

513
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:22,590
Scott: You got robots you got samurais you got cat burglars.

514
00:37:23,452 --> 00:37:46,250
Rym: When this cat burglar is attacked by a vicious German guard dog that's about to kill this cat burglar I'm not revealing the gender of the cat burglar because it might be a spoiler Despite the fact that the manga kind of I keep saying epic but it epically gets rid of the old cliche of You can't tell who I am when you're wearing a mask because when the main character sees the cat burglar for the first time.

515
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:51,726
Scott: He's like take all that stupid mask Instead of the cliche ha ha ha I'm wearing glasses.

516
00:37:51,766 --> 00:37:52,650
Scott: You don't know I'm Superman.

517
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:54,274
Scott: It's the cliche of aha.

518
00:37:54,295 --> 00:37:55,738
Scott: The main character is so badass.

519
00:37:55,779 --> 00:37:56,922
Scott: He sees through everything.

520
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:59,930
Rym: I don't know if anyone actually didn't see through it.

521
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:01,905
Scott: I just think people I saw right through it.

522
00:38:01,925 --> 00:38:02,650
Rym: No, I'm high ready.

523
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:07,690
Rym: I think people saw through the disguise in the comic too, but they didn't know who the cat burglar was.

524
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:08,936
Rym: So it didn't help him now.

525
00:38:09,017 --> 00:38:11,329
Rym: It's like oh, I recognize you but I don't know who you are.

526
00:38:13,202 --> 00:38:16,818
Rym: But This cat burglar she is so badass.

527
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:27,454
Rym: spoiler that when the guard dog is about to kill her All she does is look the dark dog in the eye and the dog basically says whoa Never the fuck mind.

528
00:38:27,775 --> 00:38:30,143
Rym: and just kind of skulks away with his tail between its legs.

529
00:38:30,343 --> 00:38:32,530
Scott: I saw that that was quite the scene.

530
00:38:33,012 --> 00:38:33,516
Rym: It's very.

531
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,850
Rym: it's drawn by our man.

532
00:38:36,151 --> 00:38:36,734
Rym: So it's got.

533
00:38:37,217 --> 00:38:39,810
Rym: the characters are all identical to the characters from sanctuary.

534
00:38:40,252 --> 00:38:43,330
Rym: The main character looks exactly like Hojo just a younger Hojo.

535
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:45,722
Scott: Well, actually that's something that Tezuka started where.

536
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:55,650
Scott: if you read a bunch of Tezuka manga You will notice that even though each different manga has different set of characters, you know There's no characters in Astro Boy that are also in Phoenix.

537
00:38:56,091 --> 00:39:02,170
Scott: But you'll notice hey that guy with a mustache in Astro Boy looks exactly like the guy with a mustache in Phoenix.

538
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:05,010
Scott: It looks like the same guy, but they're different characters in the story.

539
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:06,109
Scott: It's not like you know.

540
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,682
Scott: That's the guy from Astro Boy just happens to look exactly the same.

541
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,789
Scott: and that came from Tezuka.

542
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:22,501
Scott: You know he modeled his manga and his stories after he would go to this like sort of a theater called the I think The Takarazuka review with Takara's treasure.

543
00:39:22,521 --> 00:39:25,069
Scott: I don't know what Zuka is, but it's a treasure something review.

544
00:39:25,089 --> 00:39:29,204
Scott: and That was like in his near where he lived when he was a kid and it was like he.

545
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:32,827
Scott: just go see people put on Plays of all different kinds and it was.

546
00:39:32,847 --> 00:39:36,850
Scott: you know There's one acting troupe that was there and they would put on all different plays.

547
00:39:37,271 --> 00:39:40,825
Scott: So you see these different plays but every play has the same actors.

548
00:39:40,965 --> 00:39:47,527
Scott: so Tezuka in his manga He tells all these different stories of different characters, but it's sort of like they're the same actors.

549
00:39:47,588 --> 00:39:55,950
Scott: and I think Ryuichi Ikegami either because he couldn't draw more different kinds of characters or because he was taking some influence from Tezuka.

550
00:39:56,251 --> 00:40:01,245
Scott: Also, you know every main character and every Ryuichi Ikegami work is the same guy.

551
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:03,130
Scott: Crying Freeman is the same guy's.

552
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:05,538
Scott: Akira Hojo is the same guy's.

553
00:40:05,578 --> 00:40:13,770
Scott: the main character in this it's the same exact guy Even though they're different characters and different stories have nothing to do with each other, but it's beyond that.

554
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:17,004
Rym: I mean the the way characters look at each other.

555
00:40:17,326 --> 00:40:18,290
Rym: everything is identical.

556
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:26,675
Rym: the only difference between this and sanctuary is that sanctuary didn't have the main character pull out a katana and Cut the barrel off of a tank.

557
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,000
Scott: So sanctuary was written better.

558
00:40:28,742 --> 00:40:35,868
Rym: See that is where I might not agree Because the thing is this sounds all crazy and it's about to get crazier.

559
00:40:36,048 --> 00:40:37,816
Rym: you see Right away.

560
00:40:38,058 --> 00:40:40,510
Rym: They introduced a bunch of cameos.

561
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:49,903
Rym: I mean, you know, they're showing you like the streets of 1920s Japan and there's people dressed up in traditional gar But also people dressed as flappers and it's very, you know period commentary.

562
00:40:49,923 --> 00:40:51,488
Rym: and then they introduced to you.

563
00:40:51,508 --> 00:40:53,257
Rym: Mr Ropa and mr.

564
00:40:53,338 --> 00:40:58,783
Rym: Enneken and I didn't know who they were But apparently they were famous comedians in the 20s and 30s in Japan.

565
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:01,415
Scott: now, perhaps they were Monza To say.

566
00:41:01,435 --> 00:41:02,360
Rym: I haven't looked them up yet.

567
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:03,769
Rym: I don't know if they're Monza or not.

568
00:41:03,789 --> 00:41:06,040
Scott: there I think they're like the avid in Costello of Japan.

569
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,422
Scott: That's right.

570
00:41:06,442 --> 00:41:08,150
Scott: That's the feeling I get from reading the manga.

571
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:10,036
Rym: You definitely get that vibe now.

572
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,319
Rym: They're not just cameos.

573
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,285
Scott: over their names again Ropa and something else.

574
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:13,406
Rym: Mr.

575
00:41:13,446 --> 00:41:14,288
Rym: Ropa and mr.

576
00:41:14,429 --> 00:41:30,310
Rym: Enneken okay, but Then later on we you know We meet a bunch of famous people along the way and I think the moments that makes this manga shine is first When we meet Pablo Picasso who's drunk off his ass and just like I'm the greatest artist ever

577
00:41:31,733 --> 00:41:35,057
Scott: It's absolutely historically accurate 100%.

578
00:41:35,057 --> 00:41:44,650
Rym: but also When first kidding the main character, you know, he meets Ernest Hemingway who is played apparently by Sean Connery.

579
00:41:44,891 --> 00:41:46,998
Scott: That's also 100% historically accurate.

580
00:41:47,178 --> 00:41:53,284
Scott: Sean Connery is just you know, Ernest Hemingway pretending to you know Not be dead pretty much because good God this is this.

581
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,892
Rym: I mean, you know, I say yeah It's just.

582
00:41:55,133 --> 00:41:56,880
Rym: Ernest Hemingway is played by Sean Connery.

583
00:41:56,961 --> 00:41:59,633
Rym: and in light of what Scott said about, you know Having care.

584
00:42:00,236 --> 00:42:02,487
Rym: This is Sean Connery playing Ernest Hemingway.

585
00:42:02,547 --> 00:42:03,170
Rym: Good God.

586
00:42:03,772 --> 00:42:07,503
Rym: But so like they're all just you know, cameo cameo cameo cameo.

587
00:42:08,105 --> 00:42:11,662
Rym: and then Ernest Hemingway is there He talks to him for a while and you think the scenes over.

588
00:42:11,682 --> 00:42:13,130
Rym: Hemingway is gonna go on his way.

589
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:13,984
Rym: I'm not gonna see him again.

590
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:21,190
Rym: Well after the Nazi tank comes he tosses the ancient artifact of Japan to Ernest Hemingway.

591
00:42:21,592 --> 00:42:32,490
Rym: And there's this beautiful hilarious panel of Ernest Hemingway Just kind of like don't do to do trying to walk away nonchalant while the Nazi robot tank is wreaking havoc behind him.

592
00:42:34,054 --> 00:42:35,830
Rym: Ernest Hemingway then becomes a main character.

593
00:42:36,891 --> 00:42:50,893
Rym: Haha, I think the second moment that is wonderful is when Ernest Hemingway shows up in a military uniform an American military uniform Outside of the prison that our main character boy has been locked up in in Paris With

594
00:42:50,933 --> 00:42:53,884
Scott: a hand grenade and he's gonna go in and save him with the hand grenade.

595
00:42:54,145 --> 00:42:55,691
Rym: and he does in fact save him with the head.

596
00:42:55,731 --> 00:42:56,936
Scott: you think he is Spike Spiegel.

597
00:42:57,439 --> 00:43:10,349
Rym: and then the scene that follows is because the whole like the gist of this is like there are people who symbolize the spirit of a nation and Some nations have multiple spirits that are warring internally with each other.

598
00:43:10,852 --> 00:43:22,850
Rym: Japan has the true spirit of Japan as exemplified by this main character But it also has the rising military spirit of Japan as exemplified by the second most evil fucker in the manga.

599
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:25,763
Rym: Well, maybe the third most because there's also the scary Nazi doctor.

600
00:43:25,783 --> 00:43:27,109
Scott: Oh great Nazi doctor.

601
00:43:27,129 --> 00:43:31,382
Rym: Wonderful I don't know if he's a doctor or what but dude scary.

602
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,654
Scott: and he looks like cuz you call someone doctor doesn't mean they're a Real doctor.

603
00:43:34,694 --> 00:43:35,015
Scott: I mean dr.

604
00:43:35,357 --> 00:43:35,518
Rym: Mario.

605
00:43:35,578 --> 00:43:35,820
Rym: Yeah, dr.

606
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:36,865
Rym: Mario not doctor.

607
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:42,304
Rym: He kind of looks like a clown but and his eyes point in different directions.

608
00:43:42,504 --> 00:43:46,768
Scott: So doctor, whatever is just his clown name Apparently he's the man behind Hitler in this.

609
00:43:48,070 --> 00:44:01,279
Rym: But like Japan has this evil militaristic guy and then the main character guy and it's kind of like the two did like the old spirit of Japan and the new Probably not as good spirit of Japan.

610
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:06,817
Rym: and they're fighting out their ideological battle through these characters And I think that is the intent.

611
00:44:07,259 --> 00:44:16,890
Rym: this manga is a romp through history With just over-the-top action and great characters and cameos left and right.

612
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:21,125
Rym: This would make one fuck of a movie and I think it would be great.

613
00:44:21,145 --> 00:44:22,690
Scott: I read I didn't read the whole volume.

614
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,349
Rym: We've only got you have to read the whole thing.

615
00:44:24,692 --> 00:44:27,709
Scott: We only have one volume and Rym said there's two volumes of it.

616
00:44:28,152 --> 00:44:28,875
Rym: I would buy.

617
00:44:28,895 --> 00:44:30,322
Rym: I would pay a lot to get.

618
00:44:30,362 --> 00:44:32,070
Rym: the second volume of this guy is awesome.

619
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:36,576
Scott: Well, I read part of the first volume and from what I read I mean it was everything.

620
00:44:36,596 --> 00:44:38,305
Scott: Rym didn't really lie about any of it.

621
00:44:38,325 --> 00:44:39,370
Scott: That's exactly what it is.

622
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:50,386
Scott: But the feeling I got while reading it was that it was sort of like the plot of a one of those terrible old Poorly dubbed kung-fu movies only with some wacky historical kind of Nazi stuff thrown in.

623
00:44:50,466 --> 00:44:53,449
Rym: I think if you read the rest of it I mean you could take it that way.

624
00:44:53,714 --> 00:44:54,530
Rym: But that's it.

625
00:44:54,610 --> 00:45:05,203
Scott: That's sort of like the flow and the pacing I got was totally Kung-fu movie like at the beginning where it's like a guy sitting on a roof and then some people attack him and he fends them Off and then there's a guy saying oh ho ho you are so powerful.

626
00:45:05,444 --> 00:45:05,645
Scott: Yes.

627
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:06,309
Scott: I'm so powerful.

628
00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:17,420
Rym: now We'll go out into the world and take my father's sword but you know what that stops happening and the tone and the and the Dialogue and the action scenes are very different from that first part.

629
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:26,647
Scott: pretty much once he is in Paris and actually on his journey Yeah, well, I will put it somewhere in my just now increase to read pile and then we'll see.

630
00:45:26,667 --> 00:45:26,847
Scott: well

631
00:45:28,057 --> 00:45:36,918
Rym: It is a romp I think that's the only word I can use and it's just him and Ernest Hemingway and Picasso and out of on Bismarck going around Fucking shit up and saving the world from

632
00:45:36,978 --> 00:45:39,670
Scott: Nazis is by no means highbrow in any case but

633
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:52,110
Rym: at the same time it like I was you know, the spirit of Japan the spirit of Germany the spirit of France and Every like every nation has a character that is kind of like a caricature of the spirit of that nation.

634
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:57,492
Rym: So like G Gundam, but it's not stupid like G Gundam Unwatchable.

635
00:45:57,692 --> 00:46:07,025
Rym: what I mean, I couldn't even enjoy it comedically when that stupid cactus whatever gun I can enjoy the idea and a still image of those crazy.

636
00:46:07,065 --> 00:46:08,490
Scott: Yes, but that's all I could enjoy.

637
00:46:08,691 --> 00:46:12,061
Rym: I was forced to watch more than five minutes of G gun.

638
00:46:12,181 --> 00:46:23,573
Rym: Oh, yeah, because it was sent to us by the company and We were supposed to show it at some con that myself and Scott Johnson were running events for on behalf of the RIT Anime Club a long time ago.

639
00:46:23,653 --> 00:46:30,335
Rym: Let me tell you we could not keep a single human being in that showing room for more than 45 seconds.

640
00:46:33,031 --> 00:46:40,952
Rym: So in order to not get screwed by the company we sat there and filled out 400 surveys about the anime Awesome.

641
00:46:41,072 --> 00:46:42,639
Scott: Did you say it was terrible on all of them?

642
00:46:43,321 --> 00:46:43,663
Rym: I did.

643
00:46:43,743 --> 00:46:44,205
Rym: he didn't.

644
00:46:44,386 --> 00:46:47,359
Scott: okay, but Talk about my manga now.

645
00:46:47,379 --> 00:46:55,948
Scott: All right, you can talk about yours but all I want to say is that it doesn't matter if we like or dislike this manga because it's gonna be Impossible for you to ever buy this thing.

646
00:46:57,351 --> 00:47:02,722
Rym: I'm going to get it and I'm probably gonna have some sort of contest and if someone is worthy I'm going to give it to them.

647
00:47:03,308 --> 00:47:06,039
Scott: Oh Samurai, but then we won't have it.

648
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:07,085
Scott: We need to get another copy.

649
00:47:07,145 --> 00:47:08,130
Scott: samurai crusader.

650
00:47:08,211 --> 00:47:09,986
Rym: This is gonna be like sanctuary or Eagle.

651
00:47:10,026 --> 00:47:13,670
Scott: by the way I couldn't find anything about samurai crusader on the anime news network at all.

652
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:19,613
Rym: This is going to be like sanctuary or Eagle where pretty much whenever I see copies of it that are in good condition I'm going to buy them.

653
00:47:19,954 --> 00:47:22,461
Scott: Mmm good call, but samurai crusader.

654
00:47:22,501 --> 00:47:30,790
Rym: put out by Viz graphic novel the krumo Maru Chronicles story by Hiroi Oji, maybe I should look for cool Maru art by rio ichi ikigami.

655
00:47:31,112 --> 00:47:44,764
Rym: I couldn't find ropa and enoki by the way, I recommend this highly if you are at all like me or if you like just over-the-top but kind of well-written and Kind of poignant but then Nazis.

656
00:47:44,804 --> 00:47:46,819
Rym: Oh There's this.

657
00:47:46,839 --> 00:47:47,829
Rym: this is the last thing I'm done.

658
00:47:48,392 --> 00:48:00,250
Rym: So, you know the arts by the sanctuary guy and I don't know who their writer was but you know There's very much like young men fighting to like come out and save the world and like we're going to take over the government and blah.

659
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:10,405
Rym: Well Goebbels and Gering are young idealistic German young men who have joined the Nazi Party and they've just broken into government.

660
00:48:11,227 --> 00:48:12,110
Rym: and now it's our chance.

661
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:12,975
Rym: We're gonna rise up.

662
00:48:13,196 --> 00:48:15,930
Rym: We're gonna make the world a better place and they shake hands.

663
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:21,849
Rym: They're like, hopefully we'll go far together and it's so like sanctuary except that we know how that ends.

664
00:48:23,512 --> 00:48:24,817
Scott: Who knows the second volume of this?

665
00:48:24,837 --> 00:48:27,930
Scott: think of even crazier with Nazis turning to be good or who knows what?

666
00:48:29,234 --> 00:48:30,939
Rym: I cannot recommend this highly enough.

667
00:48:32,123 --> 00:48:34,389
Scott: I can recommend it less but it's not bad suck.

668
00:48:35,531 --> 00:48:38,340
Scott: Anyway, I recommend this mug and much more.

669
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:52,167
Scott: see we went to not the comic book store in the city But a long time ago months ago We went to the local sort of general geek store Which has you know board games and miniatures and paintball and card games and video games and books.

670
00:48:52,287 --> 00:48:57,690
Rym: It's no millennium I think there's only one millennium and that's in Rochester the best gaming store in the world.

671
00:48:57,932 --> 00:49:00,410
Scott: It's just a general local geek store, right?

672
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:06,309
Scott: So he went there and we're just looking around waiting for board games or whatever to happen because we're playing with people whatnot?

673
00:49:06,651 --> 00:49:13,517
Scott: And you know, even if you go to geek store you look at everything they got and I think the manga was like what buy one get one free buy one get two free something like that.

674
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:17,442
Scott: and And I look in and they it's not like a manga store.

675
00:49:17,462 --> 00:49:17,864
Scott: I mean board.

676
00:49:17,884 --> 00:49:20,516
Scott: There's a Barnes & Noble right there So they're not really competing there.

677
00:49:20,556 --> 00:49:23,429
Scott: Obviously, they weren't buying any new manga at this place, you know.

678
00:49:23,851 --> 00:49:30,150
Scott: But they had some manga sitting there on a shelf and I saw a Kurosage Corps delivery service volume one.

679
00:49:30,794 --> 00:49:33,150
Scott: So I grabbed that and then I realized I got some free.

680
00:49:33,331 --> 00:49:39,396
Scott: so I looked at what else was on the shelf and what I wanted for what I was gonna take for free and There wasn't much selection.

681
00:49:39,437 --> 00:49:40,140
Scott: Let me tell you.

682
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:42,410
Scott: I mean the Kurosage Corps delivery service volume one.

683
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:43,436
Scott: That's pretty much all I wanted.

684
00:49:43,718 --> 00:49:54,842
Scott: So of course instead of going for something Yeah, I mean instead of going for something like I think that as a volume of slayers I wanted to go for something completely unknown, you know If it's free might as well take something random and see what you get.

685
00:49:55,324 --> 00:49:56,830
Scott: and boy did I luck out?

686
00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:02,170
Scott: Basically, I picked this manga called the bug boy now and it part two.

687
00:50:02,372 --> 00:50:12,950
Scott: It says on the side of it He know horror number two right from published by Coco row books and because it was number two I felt like I wouldn't read it until I got number one.

688
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,707
Scott: So it was just sitting on the shelf in my room, you know unread.

689
00:50:16,089 --> 00:50:16,776
Rym: now I'm not gonna.

690
00:50:16,918 --> 00:50:17,970
Rym: I'll let Scott talk about it.

691
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:24,715
Rym: But the only reason Scott read it is because I randomly was in his room looking for another comic and I saw it there And I was like, oh, yeah that thing.

692
00:50:25,297 --> 00:50:27,065
Rym: so I opened up and I flipped through it like, oh, huh?

693
00:50:27,667 --> 00:50:28,270
Rym: That's kind of weird.

694
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:29,014
Rym: I wonder what?

695
00:50:29,175 --> 00:50:29,618
Rym: All right, fine.

696
00:50:29,638 --> 00:50:30,060
Rym: I'll read it.

697
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:30,603
Rym: It looks short.

698
00:50:30,644 --> 00:50:31,026
Rym: I read it.

699
00:50:31,106 --> 00:50:31,710
Rym: It was awesome.

700
00:50:32,332 --> 00:50:37,010
Scott: Yeah, so I wasn't gonna read it cuz I thought it was volume two and I was on the lookout for volume one.

701
00:50:37,091 --> 00:50:44,099
Scott: but you know and Rym started reading it and he found out it was actually a Self-contained story beginning middle and end like this.

702
00:50:44,179 --> 00:50:47,630
Rym: he know horror series of manga which I want to get the rest of now.

703
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:50,278
Scott: Yeah, is this guy named Hideshi Hino?

704
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:57,179
Scott: He's obviously a manga creator and he created these horror manga and He made each volume of the horror.

705
00:50:57,199 --> 00:50:59,849
Scott: manga is a separate story having nothing to do with the other.

706
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:08,346
Scott: So is a picture of him in the back of the book that shows him standing there with you know The long samurai sword and then the short one and he's kind of scary looking dude here.

707
00:51:08,407 --> 00:51:18,418
Scott: Yeah Anyway, like Richard Garrett something like that, but it doesn't matter because he actually this manga is Not like nothing I've ever read.

708
00:51:18,478 --> 00:51:21,250
Scott: let's say that it's called the bug boy, right?

709
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:24,179
Scott: I guess the Hino horror number one was some different story.

710
00:51:24,219 --> 00:51:27,530
Scott: and he know horror number three is some other story, right?

711
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,095
