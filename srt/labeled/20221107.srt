1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,040
Rym: It's Monday November 7th 2022.

2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,509
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:18,662
Rym: tonight We are talking about the posse model.

4
00:00:19,024 --> 00:00:22,950
Rym: publish on your own site syndicate everywhere elsewhere.

5
00:00:24,311 --> 00:00:25,379
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:28,875
Rym: Oh, I guess it is elsewhere Just elsewhere.

7
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:31,429
Rym: Yeah, I say I say I should go for everywhere.

8
00:00:32,836 --> 00:00:32,977
Scott: Good.

9
00:00:32,997 --> 00:00:34,130
Scott: Good luck trying to get everywhere.

10
00:00:35,693 --> 00:00:38,570
Rym: It's aspirational it's a should not a must in the RFC.

11
00:00:42,647 --> 00:00:45,022
Rym: Okay, I Guess DST and Powerball are too good opening bits.

12
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:46,530
Scott: No power boss.

13
00:00:48,353 --> 00:00:53,838
Rym: So there is a an old and ancient and Really bad logical fallacy.

14
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:56,268
Rym: It's sort of like a very specific and famous argument.

15
00:00:56,368 --> 00:01:00,450
Rym: That is objectively wrong and easily defeated.

16
00:01:01,012 --> 00:01:05,730
Rym: But it made is particularly popular in Christian circles and that is Pascal's wager.

17
00:01:06,455 --> 00:01:08,812
Rym: You're unfamiliar with Pascal's wager The.

18
00:01:08,893 --> 00:01:16,662
Rym: the idea is that either you in your life You have to bet and your bet is does the Christian God exist or not?

19
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:22,479
Rym: if you bet yes, and you're right Infinite reward, you know you go to heaven or whatever.

20
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,322
Rym: Yeah bet.

21
00:01:23,342 --> 00:01:23,643
Rym: Yes.

22
00:01:24,124 --> 00:01:24,425
Scott: No.

23
00:01:24,786 --> 00:01:25,950
Rym: Well, you only lose a little bit.

24
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:26,914
Rym: You just died nothing.

25
00:01:27,175 --> 00:01:29,784
Rym: But if you bet no and Right.

26
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:31,072
Scott: so that so, you're right.

27
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:33,323
Rym: so Oh Scott You can't hold it in.

28
00:01:33,443 --> 00:01:39,680
Rym: anyone with even a small amount of logic immediately sees why Pascal's wager is a terrible logic experiment.

29
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:42,140
Rym: It is wrong from like 20 different perspectives.

30
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:50,752
Rym: It is disproven by a gentle grunt of anyone who knows anything about anything like Choosing to believe it and being wrong.

31
00:01:50,873 --> 00:01:52,138
Scott: It's like oh you didn't lose much.

32
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:52,560
Scott: What do you mean?

33
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,140
Scott: I just spent my whole life praying and obeying these nonsense.

34
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,768
Scott: Huge cost that's a huge cost.

35
00:01:57,788 --> 00:01:59,353
Scott: not a small cause but even worse.

36
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:03,047
Rym: and I think Homer said it best and I think season four The Simpsons I'll paraphrase him.

37
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:05,780
Rym: He said something like and what if we worship the wrong God?

38
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,400
Rym: Are we just making the real God angrier and angrier every day?

39
00:02:12,593 --> 00:02:16,752
Rym: But Powerball the lottery right now.

40
00:02:17,335 --> 00:02:20,210
Rym: Is that a Terrifying amount of money.

41
00:02:20,612 --> 00:02:22,100
Scott: It is the biggest it's ever been.

42
00:02:22,382 --> 00:02:23,350
Scott: It is one point.

43
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:27,882
Scott: the jackpot is 1.9 billion Dollars.

44
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:30,007
Scott: that obviously most places.

45
00:02:30,048 --> 00:02:33,517
Scott: the taxes will be half and if anyone else wins well half again.

46
00:02:33,537 --> 00:02:41,553
Scott: Yeah, but it's like Okay a billion dollars For we're going to at the a billion dollars, right?

47
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,700
Scott: How many billionaires are on earth?

48
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,533
Scott: How many billion more than you think but not that many.

49
00:02:47,553 --> 00:02:49,520
Scott: the number that should exist is zero.

50
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:53,418
Scott: The number that do exist is about a thousand, right.

51
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:58,580
Scott: so We're gonna take at random complete random right.

52
00:02:59,841 --> 00:03:03,535
Scott: Somebody who a is okay gambling, right?

53
00:03:03,576 --> 00:03:04,540
Scott: That's something that right.

54
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,940
Scott: Yeah, B is in the United States or at least located in the unit, you know somewhere that they can buy a Powerball ticket.

55
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,025
Scott: Not Utah, Nevada.

56
00:03:12,045 --> 00:03:13,190
Scott: I don't think they don't sell them there.

57
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,219
Rym: Yeah, there's like four states that don't allow it.

58
00:03:15,923 --> 00:03:24,539
Scott: Yeah, someone who was basically within the past few days In a place where a Powerball ticket was for sale had two dollars chose to buy it.

59
00:03:25,182 --> 00:03:36,420
Scott: One of those people will be randomly selected to become one of the thousand Wealthiest most powerful people on the face of the planet based on no merit or anything.

60
00:03:37,162 --> 00:03:47,447
Scott: Now that is everyone who paid two dollars will be chipping in to help that person out now To make a modern Pascal's wager.

61
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:57,659
Rym: that is basically for all intents and purposes in a capitalist Hellward world an infinite reward like that is enough money even after taxes for someone who?

62
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,660
Rym: Gives a shit to change the world like that is good.

63
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:04,729
Scott: We could all get lucky right if this.

64
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:11,131
Scott: but the person who wins it happens to be a person like me Right who would try to fuck the?

65
00:04:11,212 --> 00:04:16,920
Scott: you know, fuck the world in a good way Make things better or at least a tech, you know or succeed or fail.

66
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,219
Rym: You're gonna crack the world shell and you're gonna hope that there's something good in there.

67
00:04:21,023 --> 00:04:24,520
Scott: Right, not just someone who's gonna live on a beach or in a Ferrari.

68
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,300
Scott: I mean that probably do those things too, but like not just only do those.

69
00:04:28,086 --> 00:04:34,902
Rym: If I won like I'm gonna try to change the world but I'm also going to make sure I'm very comfortable while I do so like I'm gonna but Comfort can.

70
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,973
Scott: hopefully it won't be a person who's right.

71
00:04:37,993 --> 00:04:40,100
Scott: Hopefully it won't be a person who squanders it.

72
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:44,050
Scott: It's easy to even that a ludicrous amount of money.

73
00:04:44,692 --> 00:04:47,640
Scott: It is easy to squander it all quickly.

74
00:04:47,883 --> 00:04:51,529
Rym: Yep, way easier Might have implied.

75
00:04:51,610 --> 00:05:04,619
Scott: to those of you who even know what that is Yep, I mean, you know, but buy something large and it fails right, you know by an Be too generous with other people and then your whole family loots you and then that's it.

76
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:07,100
Rym: No, I did learn something recently.

77
00:05:07,422 --> 00:05:10,560
Rym: There's I forget where it was might have been like the Atlantic but far clink to it.

78
00:05:10,921 --> 00:05:17,220
Rym: It was a long article talking about the myth that most lottery winners end up destitute and ruined and destroyed.

79
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:25,940
Scott: They don't have destitute but a lot of them You know don't manage the money as well as they could and don't live a life of luxury as high as they could have lived.

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,740
Rym: Yeah, but a long form analysis showed that most lottery winners big jackpots actually do just fine and do just retire and live.

81
00:05:34,582 --> 00:05:43,519
Rym: But the few who go out in a blaze of glory are the ones that everybody knows about and the media will talk about When they go out in their blaze of glory.

82
00:05:44,322 --> 00:05:57,059
Scott: See, I said this elsewhere, but I want to say the person who is the luckiest person right now Right is not the person who buys a Powerball ticket and has a one out of 200 million something chance of winning All right.

83
00:05:57,187 --> 00:06:02,878
Scott: Yeah It is the person who is a lawyer who is an expert on taking care of people who won the lottery.

84
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:18,123
Scott: because the odds are if When someone wins this which will eventually happen if not today then soon is going to call One of those few lawyers who is an expert on handling people or in the lottery or they aren't in which case Bring the popcorn.

85
00:06:18,424 --> 00:06:23,339
Scott: if it's the kind of person who is not going to call one of those lawyers the billion will be squandered.

86
00:06:25,944 --> 00:06:27,840
Rym: So here's a modern Powerball.

87
00:06:29,002 --> 00:06:33,480
Scott: If I won I would be calling one of those people before I called any friend or family.

88
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:41,460
Rym: Yep, I would not type the words into anything Nor would I say it out loud because at that point you're in extreme danger.

89
00:06:42,481 --> 00:06:47,980
Scott: Yep, I would call one of those lawyers make sure it's them visit not tell them anything till I visited them in person.

90
00:06:48,061 --> 00:06:54,020
Scott: Yep They get get their advice before I even started to fill out a claim form to give you not Americans of the extent of this.

91
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,257
Rym: Danger like to be clear.

92
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:10,439
Rym: Lottery tickets in the US and the Powerball specifically is one that falls under this category are bearer Instruments meaning the law says whoever fucking has it right now is the lawful owner of it unless you can prove it was specifically stolen.

93
00:07:11,503 --> 00:07:15,603
Rym: Yep, so, you know diehard Bearer bonds.

94
00:07:15,684 --> 00:07:20,480
Rym: Yeah, there's a reason there aren't a lot of bearer instruments left on earth because they can be stolen.

95
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:21,740
Scott: Yep,

96
00:07:22,563 --> 00:07:43,039
Rym: so my new Pascal's wager if the reward is infinite and the risk to you is Two American dollars it is unlikely that those two dollars Will round up to any meaningful change in your life Compared to even a one in 200 million chance of becoming one of the richest people on earth.

97
00:07:44,682 --> 00:07:47,917
Rym: So I bought some Powerball tickets, I doubt I would like with that.

98
00:07:48,198 --> 00:07:50,269
Rym: Yeah But one last time I think I think we're good.

99
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:55,419
Rym: I got a couple this time just in case the odds are you know, what?

100
00:07:56,121 --> 00:08:02,620
Rym: The odd the like risk calculus is better than putting that money on red at a blackjack table or the blackjack.

101
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:04,688
Scott: Yeah, I mean sort of really think about it this way.

102
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,980
Scott: if you think about this way, right it cost two dollars, right?

103
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,625
Scott: It's the lot.

104
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:15,600
Scott: The jackpot is 1.9 billion Right, and it's a one out of 200 million something chance of winning.

105
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,923
Scott: Yeah, so if I mean there might be split winners or something or you know I or whatever.

106
00:08:21,003 --> 00:08:25,140
Rym: but the odds of a split winner are higher because more people are buying tickets a lot more people.

107
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:27,340
Rym: That is why nobody has ever bought those numbers.

108
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:31,039
Rym: That is why nobody will buy all the numbers because it won't work out if anyone else wins.

109
00:08:31,981 --> 00:08:41,114
Scott: Yeah, but even if you bought all the numbers right the if you just divide the jackpot by 200 million It comes out to like nine point five like ten bucks.

110
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:45,990
Scott: Yeah, so I mean that doesn't mean that like, you know, you spend two bucks.

111
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:46,772
Scott: You're gonna.

112
00:08:46,832 --> 00:08:54,396
Scott: you're probably gonna get zero not ten, but yeah It's like it's in the realm where you know the.

113
00:08:54,858 --> 00:08:55,320
Scott: it's like yeah.

114
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:04,206
Scott: Even though the odds of winning are so low the when the reward becomes high enough it starts to actually make sense Mathematically sort of.

115
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:06,834
Scott: yeah now that don't do not gamble.

116
00:09:06,855 --> 00:09:08,600
Rym: that said lotteries should be banned.

117
00:09:09,002 --> 00:09:12,960
Rym: We could we could take that money and pool it in a much more effective way.

118
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,926
Rym: It is called tech inherent right.

119
00:09:15,147 --> 00:09:25,471
Scott: this thing that is happening right randomly giving a billion dollars To well have likely half of it to the government, which is fine, right taxes Yeah.

120
00:09:26,141 --> 00:09:33,720
Scott: But giving the other billion dollars to a person at random that is not something that should ever happen in a functioning society.

121
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:40,440
Scott: Randomly us giving that amount of wealth to a single individual at least randomly is better than giving it specifically to a conservative.

122
00:09:41,442 --> 00:09:43,634
Scott: Sure, but it might be a conservative person.

123
00:09:43,674 --> 00:09:54,317
Scott: and then what yep It is it it's you know, if this is not a thing that should be happening at all Yeah, imagine locking a bunch of people in a room and randomly one of them will be handed a knife.

124
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:54,880
Rym: That's it.

125
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,685
Rym: That's the whole game.

126
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:56,651
Rym: You're locked in the room with them.

127
00:09:57,094 --> 00:10:02,440
Scott: One person gets a knife We're locked in a country and one of these people will be given a billion dollars.

128
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:14,740
Rym: And also daylight saving time just happened and The problem is half our government actually did pass a bill to do the correct thing.

129
00:10:15,362 --> 00:10:16,968
Rym: Go to daylight saving time.

130
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,354
Scott: Well stay there, right?

131
00:10:18,394 --> 00:10:20,000
Scott: Well, they did it by accident.

132
00:10:20,683 --> 00:10:24,340
Scott: Yeah, someone was literally a like not paying attention and that's how it snuck through.

133
00:10:25,462 --> 00:10:31,309
Rym: the other half of our government won't touch it with a 10-foot pole because For reasons that we don't have time to get into.

134
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:36,338
Rym: because if they're actually hard to understand and it's not like we understand them Like it's not it's a complicated space.

135
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,075
Rym: America is divided about 50/50 on what to do about daylight saving time.

136
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:47,059
Rym: weirdly like a bunch of Americans really like the current system and don't want to change.

137
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:54,420
Rym: and It's the old sicko sign story and it doesn't even line up with our political parties at all.

138
00:10:54,984 --> 00:10:57,000
Rym: Like it is almost a random distribution.

139
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,715
Rym: So it'll never happen because that's the kind of issue that our current government is incapable of talking out.

140
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:05,360
Rym: but there is news.

141
00:11:05,642 --> 00:11:07,638
Rym: There's only one news today because it's the biggest news.

142
00:11:08,605 --> 00:11:17,080
Rym: Twitter is not technically dead yet But goddamn is it moving faster than even I thought it would move toward actually dying for real?

143
00:11:17,842 --> 00:11:23,640
Scott: Yep, after all the bullshit back and forth with you know musk face we talked about all this time.

144
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,846
Scott: Yeah in the end.

145
00:11:24,866 --> 00:11:30,060
Scott: Well, it's that we there might still not be the end the end But there might be more developments in the legal front.

146
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,359
Rym: Yeah Right now all the desk got said eloquently before we started the show.

147
00:11:33,821 --> 00:11:44,011
Rym: Most of the developments since the this dipshit bought Twitter have been that dipshit did something even worse than the last thing he did And they're like three of those stories per day.

148
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:46,180
Rym: So we're not gonna catalog them all right.

149
00:11:46,281 --> 00:11:55,564
Scott: So sometime last week He actually had to go through with it and bought Twitter for reals and there are so many individual Addendums on to that of like.

150
00:11:55,604 --> 00:11:56,386
Scott: what happened since?

151
00:11:56,446 --> 00:12:04,280
Scott: firing people laying off people in mass laying off people but not giving the required 60 90 days notice is required by some states.

152
00:12:04,902 --> 00:12:17,799
Rym: breaking laws firing executives who have golden parachutes and not you know losing the Person Twitter had that any advertisers trusted during an unrelated downturn in ad buying globally?

153
00:12:18,463 --> 00:12:21,180
Scott: Yeah advertisers leaving Twitter on purpose.

154
00:12:21,644 --> 00:12:29,374
Scott: people leaving Twitter check the validation verified system changing randomly Just all.

155
00:12:29,455 --> 00:12:32,729
Scott: it's just Non-stop of it's like as soon as he bought it.

156
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:36,199
Scott: It's like every day something else on Twitter fucks the fuck up.

157
00:12:36,742 --> 00:12:45,380
Scott: Right if you didn't, you know already understand how much of just yeah Ellen musk is not you know, people make him out to be like some sort of fucking genius.

158
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:46,019
Rym: Well, you know what?

159
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:53,079
Rym: He effectively won a lottery because a lot of YouTube stardom a lot of tech pros especially white male ones.

160
00:12:53,621 --> 00:13:01,280
Rym: Three the reason they have so much money is because they happened to work at the company that hit it big by accident.

161
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,390
Rym: Yeah, how many companies tried to build PayPal?

162
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,420
Rym: Do you have any companies tried to build Amazon?

163
00:13:06,441 --> 00:13:07,118
Scott: Okay, so hold on.

164
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:15,834
Scott: so first of all, right Ellen Musk did just happen to be at PayPal and right but That's not why he's wealthy.

165
00:13:15,935 --> 00:13:20,700
Scott: Oh, yeah his family His family owns emerald mines here, right?

166
00:13:21,262 --> 00:13:33,510
Scott: Even if he said right there other people whose parents own diamond mines that you don't know about and they're living a filthy rich Luxurious life and they just keep their mouth shut and don't try to fuck with the world They're just evil on their own quietly, right?

167
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,760
Scott: This is just one asshole who had to be loud evil and stupid.

168
00:13:36,921 --> 00:13:41,020
Scott: Oh, he's not he just he's not like some fucking genius, right?

169
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:53,078
Scott: It's like, you know, you compare them to like Lex Luthor from comic books, which is somewhat apt but Lex Luthor Canonically in the DC Universe has the highest IQ of basically anyone in the entire universe human or otherwise.

170
00:13:53,118 --> 00:13:54,987
Scott: Yeah, right He's like a mega genius.

171
00:13:55,148 --> 00:14:01,208
Scott: He's just got other flaws like sociopathy Narcissism obsession with killing Superman.

172
00:14:01,268 --> 00:14:09,023
Scott: It's all right, you know inferiority complex to Superman all kinds of other Emotional is mostly related to Superman Right.

173
00:14:09,063 --> 00:14:11,874
Rym: Yeah, mostly which funnily enough gets down to what's a genius.

174
00:14:11,914 --> 00:14:13,440
Scott: He's he can invent things.

175
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,929
Scott: Ellen Musk can't invent anything.

176
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,600
Scott: All he can do is hire someone to build a rocket.

177
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,093
Scott: He couldn't he wouldn't know what the top from the bottom if it was up to him.

178
00:14:20,134 --> 00:14:21,800
Scott: He's basically got some bro.

179
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:27,000
Rym: He's got some of the power of a Lex Luthor, but none of the capabilities of a Lex Luthor, right?

180
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,499
Scott: He's just some bro.

181
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:37,070
Scott: not if you went to a college and just grab some bro from a like a from a frat who knew how to like, You know, it was at okay computer knowledge.

182
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:40,000
Scott: Like that's and you swapped him for Ellen Musk.

183
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,023
Scott: Give me the same fucking thing.

184
00:14:41,063 --> 00:14:42,869
Scott: It's just some guy right?

185
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,257
Scott: Yeah, you know who had you know, is he?

186
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:46,060
Scott: is he a moron?

187
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:46,541
Scott: It's like.

188
00:14:46,561 --> 00:14:47,264
Scott: well in some ways.

189
00:14:47,324 --> 00:14:51,240
Scott: Yes, but it's like he has about the same education we do right?

190
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,220
Scott: We're not geniuses or we can't win a fucking Nobel Prize or Fields Medal or anything, right?

191
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,780
Scott: So it's like, you know, but he's in charge of Twitter and unlike say SpaceX, right?

192
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,967
Scott: Oh, he's got his hand on the wheel of Twitter and he's crashing it On the wheel.

193
00:15:05,048 --> 00:15:09,760
Rym: He is like fucking with the engine himself While it's driving down the highway.

194
00:15:10,781 --> 00:15:16,016
Rym: Yeah, I mean dude is arguing with Stephen King like on Twitter about the $8.

195
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:18,224
Rym: is that Stephen King is like I'm not gonna pay you.

196
00:15:18,344 --> 00:15:19,348
Rym: I'm just gonna leave.

197
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:25,187
Rym: and he's trying to argue with Stephen King like no you won't Like what who is even.

198
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:31,175
Scott: but it's funny that one of the wealthiest people right now and Musk has you know Many billions much more than this lottery.

199
00:15:31,316 --> 00:15:33,809
Scott: All right Why does he get?

200
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,020
Scott: why does he need $8?

201
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:44,650
Rym: Yes, look from if I was a multi-billionaire the one thing I would not be doing is Personally arguing with dipshits online like.

202
00:15:45,032 --> 00:15:46,076
Rym: that is the one thing you do.

203
00:15:46,116 --> 00:15:46,999
Scott: that's time for that.

204
00:15:47,582 --> 00:15:48,446
Scott: Who has time for that?

205
00:15:48,868 --> 00:15:51,360
Scott: if you got if I won the lottery you probably never hear from me again.

206
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,329
Scott: Why would I spend my time?

207
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,380
Rym: That's my time.

208
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:54,123
Rym: I have my time.

209
00:15:54,183 --> 00:15:57,417
Rym: I'd be running the board of like whatever charity I built to try to save the world.

210
00:15:57,658 --> 00:16:00,838
Rym: the other half of I would be Paris key sale jumping.

211
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:06,399
Scott: Well, I wouldn't be doing that because that would be the end of the enjoyment of my billion dollars.

212
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:11,960
Scott: Good, you know, I'd be fucking you know, buying the government and turning it to the left.

213
00:16:12,241 --> 00:16:13,846
Scott: I would if I bought Twitter, you know what I do.

214
00:16:13,946 --> 00:16:16,756
Scott: I'd say, you know, it's free Nazis are banned.

215
00:16:16,936 --> 00:16:18,584
Scott: No ads for anyone Yeah, etc.

216
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:19,107
Rym: I'm gonna run it.

217
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:19,469
Rym: You know what?

218
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,160
Rym: I converted to a public benefit company.

219
00:16:21,903 --> 00:16:23,210
Scott: He already converted to a private.

220
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,456
Scott: come it's not public anymore.

221
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:27,427
Scott: So he can do that now Really be a shareholder.

222
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:29,215
Scott: Yeah, you could say no more ads.

223
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:38,008
Rym: We're not even gonna try to make money We're just gonna make Twitter the best thing ever Except what he seems to be doing with it right now as of the news I just saw scrolling from making it the worst thing ever.

224
00:16:38,068 --> 00:16:41,160
Rym: He's actively trying to get Republicans elected in our midterms tomorrow.

225
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:43,464
Scott: Yeah, well, you know, it's a bad person.

226
00:16:43,505 --> 00:16:53,009
Rym: Oh, so I guess that the threads because this conversation that people are having is so widespread Outside of my office.

227
00:16:53,492 --> 00:16:58,296
Rym: there there's a chill homeless dude Like I know him but like he hangs out around our office and there's a cop who hangs out there.

228
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:08,097
Rym: I overheard while I was waiting for a traffic light to change today the two of them talking about what they're gonna do now that Twitter is Dead like I could not make this up.

229
00:17:08,882 --> 00:17:13,465
Rym: That is the conversation they were having and the guy was like, you know The all my friend find it hard to believe.

230
00:17:13,507 --> 00:17:16,560
Scott: the cop and the homeless person were talking and this was not a white cop.

231
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:18,005
Scott: About about anything.

232
00:17:18,025 --> 00:17:19,349
Rym: this was not a white cop.

233
00:17:19,391 --> 00:17:19,973
Rym: this cop is.

234
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:20,494
Scott: I'm just saying.

235
00:17:20,515 --> 00:17:23,378
Rym: I'm not saying this is a good cop But this is not a white say.

236
00:17:25,482 --> 00:17:27,349
Rym: But I overheard this conversation.

237
00:17:27,612 --> 00:17:31,072
Rym: like my mom was meshing to me like yeah What should I use cuz Twitter's dead?

238
00:17:31,112 --> 00:17:32,140
Rym: Like I can't use it anymore.

239
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:36,700
Rym: Yeah, should I go to Mastadon or co-host or whatever?

240
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,988
Rym: But co-host is just a bunch of people.

241
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:40,735
Rym: all made accounts, but no one's posted anything.

242
00:17:40,775 --> 00:17:47,900
Scott: as far as I can see I was making accounts at places to ensure that I have the account with my name on it.

243
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,946
Scott: I'm not using any place until I know it's the play the threads I can see that are sort of relevant.

244
00:17:52,966 --> 00:18:03,960
Rym: this conversation is one the what is going to happen to the company which basically He's doing the inverse of basic management like dude fired everybody to the point that I don't know how the company will continue to operate.

245
00:18:04,882 --> 00:18:05,687
Scott: I think it's just gonna.

246
00:18:05,868 --> 00:18:06,431
Scott: it's basically.

247
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:07,860
Scott: I don't think it'll disappear and die.

248
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,560
Scott: It's too big and I still has too many people using it.

249
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:16,070
Scott: Probably some people aren't even aware or care about what's going on but I think it'll just recede like all the other.

250
00:18:16,131 --> 00:18:22,311
Scott: many other social networks have where it's still a Platforms have where it still exists, but it has less users.

251
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:27,846
Scott: Pete less like like Craigslist is still out there even though it's been gutted Live journals still out there.

252
00:18:28,188 --> 00:18:29,152
Scott: Tumblr is still out there.

253
00:18:29,172 --> 00:18:30,216
Scott: People are going to tell her.

254
00:18:30,236 --> 00:18:32,221
Scott: in fact, there's There's

255
00:18:32,301 --> 00:18:49,430
Rym: a second question around the financial health of the company in that it costs a lot But it costs a lot to run it and You can't really just take your personal money and pump it in to keep it afloat Even run out of money eventually considering here.

256
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:53,724
Scott: Here is a dark you want to hear a really dark Prediction here.

257
00:18:54,206 --> 00:18:55,110
Rym: I've heard a few.

258
00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:08,099
Rym: it is it is public information Right that he was heavily financed by the Saudi Arabian and also there's Relatively breaking news that the US government is looking into the national security implications of that.

259
00:19:09,124 --> 00:19:16,847
Scott: indeed, but the Saudi Arabians, you know are known for Using, you know violence on people.

260
00:19:16,968 --> 00:19:29,892
Scott: Yep, if he beat billionaire of the world or not You know if he fails his if they if they don't do well financially on the Twitter That is uh, who know who knows what could happen?

261
00:19:29,932 --> 00:19:34,654
Rym: that is not the darkest thing I have heard among by capital markets people.

262
00:19:34,714 --> 00:19:38,832
Scott: I know surprisingly Dark as my brain.

263
00:19:39,336 --> 00:19:41,450
Rym: Yeah, I There's some darker things about.

264
00:19:41,491 --> 00:19:46,531
Scott: I'm not saying I want that to happen I'm just saying his personal life is in shambles independent of all this.

265
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:48,237
Scott: Well, that was always been the case.

266
00:19:48,257 --> 00:19:57,860
Rym: Yep, so but there's a thread there of it might run out of operating capital because It was never running in a profit like it was always running at a loss.

267
00:19:58,181 --> 00:20:04,080
Rym: But it was making a lot of money from advertising and it appears you just had right.

268
00:20:04,221 --> 00:20:10,794
Scott: It's like if you're a start-up you have your money from you know Investors the VC people and then you have to get more rounds when you run out.

269
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:11,818
Scott: and that's your flow.

270
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:12,420
Scott: is investment.

271
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:15,500
Scott: Spend it investment spend it until revenues, right?

272
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:32,027
Scott: and even if you're not profiting the revenues can come in and you can spend them and you have this cash flow and you can Operate by spending the cash that people give you to buy your product and you can pay your employees and you can buy stuff Even though you know, the overall Treasury is slowly shrinking.

273
00:20:32,048 --> 00:20:38,399
Scott: You can just keep operating Because there is fuel coming into the tank that will get burned, right?

274
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:45,460
Scott: It just might be burning it faster than it comes in but you know, eventually that stops working, but it still gives you runway.

275
00:20:45,641 --> 00:20:49,013
Scott: Yeah, but so Twitter doesn't have investors really.

276
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:50,740
Scott: it was public and is now private.

277
00:20:50,981 --> 00:20:52,647
Scott: So there's no cash flow coming from there.

278
00:20:53,008 --> 00:21:03,939
Scott: and if investors pull out, it's like yes, they heavily decreased operating costs by laying off so many people but They could you know run out of fuel.

279
00:21:04,201 --> 00:21:14,499
Rym: Yep, especially considering we know huge numbers of advertisers have quit now They probably don't care that much about like all the things he's fucked up.

280
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,737
Scott: Yeah, well and advertisers who have stayed might see that there's.

281
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:20,986
Scott: let you know Once the numbers have to cut, you know It's like he has to.

282
00:21:21,006 --> 00:21:23,720
Scott: he doesn't have to reveal any numbers publicly because they're not public anymore.

283
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,291
Scott: But advertisers are gonna want to see proof.

284
00:21:26,974 --> 00:21:32,140
Scott: right that you know user Registrations are up, but there's that there's a factor right now.

285
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,779
Rym: So remember the news we talked about the other day.

286
00:21:34,141 --> 00:21:43,980
Scott: Google had the first drop in advertising revenue in the history of Google and that was Google who doesn't have a you know Some random CEO suddenly at the wheel driving into a wall.

287
00:21:44,161 --> 00:21:55,020
Rym: Advertising buys on digital inventory are down across the board and companies are less Trustful or less credulous of the data they get from those companies.

288
00:21:55,422 --> 00:22:00,200
Scott: So yeah, they're basically looking for numbers go down right and especially they come from him.

289
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,379
Scott: They're not trusted numbers.

290
00:22:01,741 --> 00:22:06,577
Scott: The advertisers that stay are gonna want to pay less and they're gonna buy less if they stay at all.

291
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:12,400
Rym: and the ones that leave They're looking for any excuse to cut their advertising budgets because of the current economic climate.

292
00:22:13,022 --> 00:22:20,251
Rym: Musk handed them an excuse to just say what cut it to zero and then they can go to their boss and say yeah I just saved us 15 million dollars a year.

293
00:22:20,614 --> 00:22:21,177
Rym: What'd you give up?

294
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:21,600
Rym: Nothing?

295
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,483
Scott: Nothing is right.

296
00:22:24,026 --> 00:22:26,980
Rym: So Twitter is a company might just collapse entirely.

297
00:22:27,487 --> 00:22:35,285
Scott: independently of that There's a whole but could be a situation where once it's small enough someone else buys it for buys it low like the pinboard guy Bought delicious.

298
00:22:35,305 --> 00:22:41,220
Rym: Yeah, I would love to buy Twitter But maybe if I went it'll still be too high for you to buy if I win that Powerball.

299
00:22:42,323 --> 00:22:44,076
Scott: If you win the Powerball, you could buy it right now.

300
00:22:44,136 --> 00:22:48,234
Rym: Yeah I feel like I feel like that train company.

301
00:22:48,556 --> 00:22:53,394
Scott: It's ready for some shorts And see you you would wait for the last train to rust and then jump.

302
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:54,680
Scott: Yeah, there's no reason to do it now.

303
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:01,100
Rym: Yeah, it's probably still too high but Twitter's got like four to trains, but we are fast approaching the rust.

304
00:23:02,162 --> 00:23:07,568
Rym: so there's also the threat of people who use Twitter as a source of journalism.

305
00:23:07,588 --> 00:23:14,235
Rym: a lot of people go there to find out about the news and Mmm, there's really nothing normal people will use.

306
00:23:14,275 --> 00:23:18,970
Scott: that replaces that And I think normal people don't even use Twitter.

307
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,760
Scott: normal people use other new like newspapers and TV.

308
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,967
Scott: You'd be shocked.

309
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:29,078
Rym: pretty much Twitter based on the data I was looking up over the last week because I've been following the whole downfall of Twitter.

310
00:23:30,044 --> 00:23:43,283
Rym: other if you discount really old people and extremely conservative people a scary percentage of Americans go to like Google News or Twitter Or places like that or Facebook Tik-tok.

311
00:23:43,585 --> 00:23:44,871
Rym: Yeah, take talk less.

312
00:23:44,971 --> 00:23:46,880
Rym: So but it's self-reported data mostly.

313
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,626
Rym: So why mmv on that?

314
00:23:49,208 --> 00:24:00,255
Rym: but the journalists are actually starting to leave the platform, which doesn't bode well, there's people who use it as a social network and They're all going to Mastodon like the people who care enough to leave.

315
00:24:00,275 --> 00:24:04,458
Rym: that seems to be the primary Destination because it's the closest to what they think Twitter is.

316
00:24:05,303 --> 00:24:16,704
Rym: Well, it's because it's the largest thing that exists already like I looked in a lot of the people I follow on Twitter who made Mastodon accounts are actually posting but the Mastodon interface kind of Sucks and I am NOT.

317
00:24:17,126 --> 00:24:18,873
Scott: I am NOT going anywhere making it.

318
00:24:18,913 --> 00:24:20,560
Scott: You can make whatever interface you want for it.

319
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,210
Rym: Oh, yeah, I could but how are normal people gonna do that?

320
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,520
Rym: You'll they'll buy your interface on the App Store, I don't think normal people quite understand how it works.

321
00:24:30,042 --> 00:24:31,830
Rym: So I'm not committing to any platform.

322
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:34,080
Rym: Like I just backed away from that kind of social media.

323
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,665
Scott: Talk about that in the main bit.

324
00:24:35,685 --> 00:24:35,926
Scott: Yep.

325
00:24:36,468 --> 00:24:47,186
Rym: So but then there's all the like the ecosystem of indie creators who basically use Twitter for all their marketing because it's free and They're all sticking around these.

326
00:24:47,407 --> 00:24:50,740
Scott: typically if you're a creator trying to market on the platforms you're posting to all.

327
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:59,976
Rym: Yep, the problem is a lot of them seem to get most of their traction from Twitter But I think everyone has a primary platform where they have most of their followers.

328
00:24:59,996 --> 00:25:01,200
Scott: It's gonna be specific to them.

329
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:09,100
Scott: If someone was someone who you know had up the biggest following on Twitter and now Twitter is failing It's like yeah, it hurts them.

330
00:25:09,142 --> 00:25:09,851
Rym: Yep And they got it.

331
00:25:09,871 --> 00:25:10,238
Rym: you got it.

332
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:16,919
Rym: If you have if your primary following is on Twitter You got to do everything you can to build backup places for people to follow you and get them there.

333
00:25:17,524 --> 00:25:18,814
Scott: I know that's that's isn't?

334
00:25:18,854 --> 00:25:21,589
Scott: that's not different That's just you know, that's how it's always been right.

335
00:25:21,609 --> 00:25:23,115
Scott: people who like, you know made.

336
00:25:23,196 --> 00:25:24,802
Scott: I talked about this story so many times.

337
00:25:24,842 --> 00:25:35,480
Scott: the company where all the company did was make a Visual Studio plugin and it's like the end game for them was either have Microsoft buy them or Microsoft add that feature to Visual Studio and their company goes out of business, right?

338
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:37,046
Scott: So it's like if you're.

339
00:25:37,126 --> 00:25:45,820
Scott: if your business depends on someone else's business You basically have to a hope they don't fail be always stay in their good graces, right?

340
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,602
Scott: Etc.

341
00:25:46,662 --> 00:25:47,446
Scott: You can't other.

342
00:25:47,486 --> 00:25:50,660
Scott: you should be building your business so that it can stand on its own feet.

343
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:58,936
Scott: And if it if you're leaning on someone else and they fall down through even through no fault of your own Well, I mean I don't want to blame the victim but it that's just.

344
00:25:59,076 --> 00:25:59,820
Scott: that's just business.

345
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,959
Rym: But I think I've noticed a lot of younger people who have not you like not been around.

346
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:16,468
Rym: I mean social media came into existence while we were already online Like we have been online for the entirety of the existence of the concept of social media Platforms geocities like aim everything all

347
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:20,499
Scott: the way that he had or cut accounts right on day one almost day one ish.

348
00:26:21,182 --> 00:26:24,060
Scott: So I remember when Facebook was a new thing.

349
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,749
Scott: I had a Facebook account when it was college.

350
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:32,856
Rym: by the time Facebook came out I wasn't at college with the university email address anymore, and I couldn't sign up for it.

351
00:26:32,876 --> 00:26:37,531
Rym: I Was working at IBM and I didn't have access to my old RIT email anymore.

352
00:26:38,454 --> 00:26:40,139
Scott: My Twitter account is 15 years old.

353
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:54,660
Rym: Yep So but I think a lot of younger people or people who haven't been around this block I'd think they radically underestimate how quickly a Seemingly too big to fail platform can suddenly fail.

354
00:26:55,101 --> 00:26:59,413
Rym: Like I don't think they realize how fast old platforms went from.

355
00:26:59,754 --> 00:27:02,000
Rym: it'll last forever - there are 10 people left.

356
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:04,731
Scott: Well, I think we've gone through an extensive period.

357
00:27:04,771 --> 00:27:07,020
Scott: like I said, the Twitter account is 15 years old, right?

358
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,175
Rym: So we've got used it longer than any social media platform.

359
00:27:10,275 --> 00:27:11,120
Rym: I have ever used.

360
00:27:11,782 --> 00:27:25,300
Scott: Alright, we've gone through a period where the sub the platforms that are big now have had a staying power of some sort even though I guess tik-tok's new and Whereas the period before then they were coming up and going down like every year a few years, right?

361
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,965
Scott: They were coming and going right and it's like.

362
00:27:27,487 --> 00:27:31,320
Scott: I was always been of the opinion that like yeah, Google can fail one day.

363
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,017
Scott: It's like, you know, myspace looked unassailable right.

364
00:27:34,057 --> 00:27:37,962
Scott: all these things Unassailable Right.

365
00:27:38,022 --> 00:27:39,848
Scott: It's like it still exists, but it's small.

366
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,914
Scott: It's it's like I don't so I didn't.

367
00:27:42,095 --> 00:27:45,062
Scott: I don't believe that anything is Unfailable.

368
00:27:45,102 --> 00:27:45,283
Scott: right.

369
00:27:45,323 --> 00:27:46,347
Scott: Facebook is dying.

370
00:27:46,829 --> 00:27:47,672
Scott: Twitter is dying.

371
00:27:47,692 --> 00:27:49,680
Scott: No, right, you know tik-tok can die.

372
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,247
Scott: I even believe YouTube can die.

373
00:27:51,347 --> 00:27:52,733
Scott: I don't know what's gonna happen when it does.

374
00:27:52,773 --> 00:27:52,913
Scott: Yep.

375
00:27:53,195 --> 00:27:58,040
Rym: I there's a reason I have a Vulnerable of everything I've ever uploaded to YouTube.

376
00:27:58,901 --> 00:28:01,970
Scott: YouTube seems more invulnerable than anything that's ever been.

377
00:28:02,712 --> 00:28:05,260
Scott: I'm confident that YouTube will die within my lifetime.

378
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:12,620
Rym: I don't know what's gonna look like, you know, one thing that I don't think could die is the technology part of Amazon.

379
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:19,473
Rym: I feel like it's so important that if it died a Consortium would either buy it or the government would nationalize or something would happen.

380
00:28:19,493 --> 00:28:24,590
Scott: It would be - I'm talking about You know the yeah, you know user-facing like social media platforms.

381
00:28:24,671 --> 00:28:31,000
Rym: if YouTube disappeared tomorrow, like it died tomorrow Instantly, I would not be as surprised as you would expect.

382
00:28:32,222 --> 00:28:35,280
Scott: Yeah, so, you know people got to be prepared for that anyway.

383
00:28:41,693 --> 00:28:44,703
Rym: But anyway things Of the day.

384
00:28:44,844 --> 00:28:58,008
Rym: so, uh This is an algorithm that is actually near and dear to my heart for most of my life Because I was into audio and audio engineering like back and like playing with the reel to reels as a kid.

385
00:28:58,629 --> 00:29:06,890
Rym: So the fast Fourier transform is So important to audio that talked about on GeekNights many times.

386
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,540
Rym: Yeah, it is one of the most important algorithms of all time.

387
00:29:10,122 --> 00:29:15,118
Rym: It is used for like everything and Verisatium and I haven't really I checked.

388
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:22,190
Rym: I have not linked to them more than a handful of times over the long run of GeekNights, so I'm linking to them now only because this video was so good.

389
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:28,310
Rym: It is a half hour long and it is titled the most important algorithm of all time.

390
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:42,149
Rym: And it talks about not just how fast Fourier transform works where it came from Why it was so important compared to an actual Fourier transform like doing the full transformation Against a full data set.

391
00:29:42,832 --> 00:29:48,930
Rym: But it gets into things that you probably never even thought this algorithm was in any way related to.

392
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:53,430
Rym: This is just a fantastic deep exploration of how important FFT is.

393
00:29:55,826 --> 00:29:58,681
Scott: So Talk about some ROMs, right?

394
00:29:58,701 --> 00:30:08,870
Scott: I don't know if anyone out there The listener has ever tried to play an arcade ROM and maim Yeah, but unlike say, you know, you might dump, you know, like an NES ROM, right?

395
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:19,466
Scott: It comes out as one file an NES file and that's it Right, and even though the NES cartridge might have multiple ROM chips in it You basically, you know, you read out the whole cartridge, right?

396
00:30:19,687 --> 00:30:20,762
Scott: Yeah, that's it You know.

397
00:30:21,356 --> 00:30:28,730
Scott: but for maim Right an arcade machine an old arcade machine is like a motherboard with a whole bunch of ROM chips on it like integrated.

398
00:30:29,352 --> 00:30:29,893
Scott: It's not like.

399
00:30:29,914 --> 00:30:31,759
Scott: there's some I guess for neogeo.

400
00:30:31,779 --> 00:30:35,410
Scott: There's gonna be a cartridge right I guess but for other ones not so much.

401
00:30:35,551 --> 00:30:44,789
Scott: So you basically had to pop out all those individual RAM chips and You know, they're EEPROMs or whatever and read them individually and make a binary file for each one.

402
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,215
Scott: Alright, and it's like.

403
00:30:47,275 --> 00:30:54,161
Scott: I never really thought about like, you know what it looks like when you try to like rip You know a ROM from an arcade board.

404
00:30:54,181 --> 00:31:09,743
Scott: Alright, so this person here They happen to get an arcade board for a game called the gladiator some beat-em-up game and just coincidentally The board they had had version 1.04 of the game.

405
00:31:09,823 --> 00:31:17,991
Scott: and it turns out that maim and you know If you go to you know, they had version 1.07 and they had like version 1.

406
00:31:17,991 --> 00:31:26,279
Scott: Yeah, they didn't have any of these in-between versions and they were like, oh I got a version of an arcade machine That is not on maim that they didn't know about.

407
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:33,830
Scott: Alright, let me rip it and upload it and They had the hardware to do it and I was like, oh, so that's what that looks like that and it worked.

408
00:31:34,334 --> 00:31:35,000
Rym: It's really cool.

409
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:35,202
Scott: Yeah.

410
00:31:36,972 --> 00:31:46,650
Scott: so now if you if you come across an arcade machine, what you should do is Check the version and then look on maim and see if you know that version is in the database.

411
00:31:46,831 --> 00:31:49,750
Scott: And if it's not find someone who's got an EEPROM reader.

412
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,055
Scott: Preserve that.

413
00:31:52,196 --> 00:31:53,949
Scott: that's slightly different version of the game.

414
00:31:54,512 --> 00:32:04,790
Scott: but I thought was really interesting is that like there were a few different EEPROM chips in the on the board that they had to And all of them were basically identical to the ones that were already up there except for one.

415
00:32:04,971 --> 00:32:08,062
Scott: So it was really just one chip had something a different code on it.

416
00:32:08,584 --> 00:32:09,708
Scott: They needed to be modified.

417
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:17,610
Rym: So In the meta moment the GeekNights book club book is currently a leaf the unseen.

418
00:32:19,194 --> 00:32:20,668
Scott: I wonder if I can even see this book.

419
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:28,096
Scott: I bought it Also You know, it's it's.

420
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:31,189
Scott: I guess it's what's a cyberpunk middle-eastern deal.

421
00:32:31,571 --> 00:32:40,150
Scott: Rimsky out it from - I'll leave the unseen is a middle-eastern Choices of books from the same author who only has two books that aren't common a middle-eastern cyberpunk adventure.

422
00:32:40,732 --> 00:32:42,778
Rym: I think Scott you wrote the words out our website.

423
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:46,470
Rym: that description alone is enough to convince me to read it and that is correct.

424
00:32:47,113 --> 00:32:47,535
Scott: Well, yep.

425
00:32:47,696 --> 00:32:48,922
Scott: I think that's probably what made me add.

426
00:32:48,942 --> 00:32:50,188
Scott: It's my wish list in the first place.

427
00:32:50,389 --> 00:33:01,749
Scott: Yep Also previous book club book city we became well just like the other day like maybe less than a week ago the book the sequel book world we made.

428
00:33:03,011 --> 00:33:04,817
Scott: Also band K. Jemisin was released.

429
00:33:05,218 --> 00:33:06,503
Scott: so you can now read that book.

430
00:33:06,663 --> 00:33:10,761
Scott: Although it is not the book club selection We might do an episode on it.

431
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:12,290
Scott: That's not a book club episode.

432
00:33:12,511 --> 00:33:13,534
Rym: I think it might be worth it.

433
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:16,846
Rym: That series is a very speaks to us shall we say.

434
00:33:17,047 --> 00:33:19,714
Scott: it's getting red though Absolutely, I got.

435
00:33:19,755 --> 00:33:21,922
Rym: I got to know what happens with that horrible island.

436
00:33:22,906 --> 00:33:23,087
Scott: Yeah.

437
00:33:23,388 --> 00:33:25,295
Rym: Yeah All right.

438
00:33:25,356 --> 00:33:43,629
Rym: Otherwise, uh, of course I have just left Twitter entirely but it underscores how deeply Twitter got its tentacles into everything that the streaming template that the 14 people watching the stream are seeing still has both of our Twitter handles in it Despite the fact that I have literally deleted the Twitter app.

439
00:33:44,032 --> 00:33:45,278
Rym: I gotta fix that at some point.

440
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:47,108
Scott: is the same handle on every platform?

441
00:33:47,188 --> 00:33:48,915
Scott: true I'm not.

442
00:33:49,077 --> 00:33:50,990
Rym: I don't actually use this handle on many places.

443
00:33:51,111 --> 00:33:56,264
Rym: I use this on Twitter a long goddamn time ago But I actually go by GeekNights' Rym or just Rym.

444
00:33:56,324 --> 00:33:58,977
Rym: on most other platforms Shazar is kind of a.

445
00:33:59,298 --> 00:34:01,930
Scott: you should have gone by the same name everywhere then it's much easier.

446
00:34:02,151 --> 00:34:05,962
Rym: Well, the problem is I tried to but thrill house was taken on most platforms.

447
00:34:06,604 --> 00:34:07,266
Scott: That's a prize.

448
00:34:07,286 --> 00:34:07,848
Scott: Not my fault.

449
00:34:08,029 --> 00:34:08,309
Rym: Yep.

450
00:34:09,992 --> 00:34:16,382
Rym: So otherwise if you have fled Twitter like us The best place to talk to us is our own forum.

451
00:34:16,402 --> 00:34:18,790
Rym: the GeekNights' forum is rocking and I'm spending more time in there.

452
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:19,391
Rym: It's cool place.

453
00:34:19,672 --> 00:34:19,873
Rym: Also.

454
00:34:19,893 --> 00:34:21,018
Rym: There is a GeekNights' discord.

455
00:34:21,038 --> 00:34:21,981
Rym: There's cool people in there.

456
00:34:22,222 --> 00:34:23,286
Rym: cool stuff happens in there.

457
00:34:23,306 --> 00:34:27,550
Rym: Uh Otherwise, I don't know if email us like email still works.

458
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:33,327
Rym: Email is adjacent to social media and I still have a Google account.

459
00:34:33,347 --> 00:34:34,130
Rym: So I guess there's that.

460
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:41,126
Scott: hmm, yeah, so You know in the wake of Twitter dying, right?

461
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:42,010
Scott: We have to discuss.

462
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:42,936
Scott: You know, what?

463
00:34:42,976 --> 00:34:43,822
Scott: What do we do now?

464
00:34:44,043 --> 00:34:50,043
Scott: Right and it's like You know for the longer for GeekNights' entire existence, right?

465
00:34:50,123 --> 00:34:54,964
Scott: We've done a pretty good job of Somewhat strictly following what's known as what.

466
00:34:54,984 --> 00:34:56,290
Scott: I didn't realize it had a name.

467
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:58,436
Scott: I was just following it without knowing it had a name.

468
00:34:58,757 --> 00:34:58,978
Rym: Yep.

469
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,930
Rym: I similarly I always just thought of it as why doesn't everyone do this?

470
00:35:03,073 --> 00:35:14,310
Scott: It makes sense Right the way we used to do things which is the posse model Right, and it's called posse because it stands for publish on your own site POS, right?

471
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:32,390
Scott: syndicate elsewhere se right and the idea is You are going to put out some something you've made on to the internet so that other people can see it be it text video audio Video game, you know PDF file, whatever some data you want to put it out there in the world, right?

472
00:35:33,035 --> 00:35:39,750
Scott: So you could And what people mostly do these days is go to a platform, right?

473
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:45,350
Scott: Maybe it's a photo and they put it on some photo site like smug mug or flicker or yeah Graham.

474
00:35:45,831 --> 00:35:48,595
Scott: Maybe it's a video and they upload it to YouTube or Vimeo.

475
00:35:48,876 --> 00:35:54,409
Scott: Maybe it's a short text and they put it on Twitter or Somewhere else like that if it still exists.

476
00:35:54,932 --> 00:35:56,780
Scott: Maybe it's a long text and they put it on.

477
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:02,374
Scott: they have a blogger or the wordpress.com or you know Anywhere right.

478
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:06,850
Scott: this does, you know, you can cross it all, you know, they got a music and they put it on SoundCloud, right?

479
00:36:07,555 --> 00:36:14,487
Scott: and What inevitably happens is those places die they shut down they do copyright takedowns.

480
00:36:14,888 --> 00:36:17,958
Scott: They do right You know, they delete accounts.

481
00:36:17,998 --> 00:36:19,083
Scott: people get banned.

482
00:36:19,425 --> 00:36:21,172
Scott: people, you know They're they.

483
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:30,537
Scott: people get angry because they're their posts got blocked or people, you know, it's like yeah, you're posting on someone else's Platform, right?

484
00:36:30,798 --> 00:36:33,049
Scott: They don't have no obligation to host you.

485
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:38,730
Scott: They're doing it because they want to make money and if they don't want you there they kick your ass out.

486
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:41,838
Scott: Yeah, you come over to might invite you into my house.

487
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:45,809
Scott: And if you behave poorly for any reason I kick your ass out.

488
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,160
Scott: Don't come back.

489
00:36:47,422 --> 00:36:48,229
Rym: That's how it works.

490
00:36:48,551 --> 00:36:56,070
Rym: All right, and Twitter is actually a place where I got very lazy about this because originally Twitter I treated as ephemeral media.

491
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,370
Rym: I treated Twitter the same way.

492
00:36:57,431 --> 00:37:21,830
Rym: I would treat like an IRC channel or like a chat on a like a Google something like I'd like to have an archive of it but I didn't treat it as publishing content so much as like ephemerally having conversations online, but over time me and many people evolved to Creating primary content directly on Twitter and I realized thinking about it now with this model.

493
00:37:22,632 --> 00:37:33,148
Rym: The only other time I've ever done that is when I briefly used tumblr and I made content on tumblr and I did not put It anywhere but tumblr and that tumblr lasted about 20 posts before I gave up on it.

494
00:37:34,192 --> 00:37:46,094
Scott: So what we used to do back in the day the posse model is instead of publishing any of your shit on these other Platforms and where it's subject to who knows what problems right you publish your shit on your own Site.

495
00:37:46,114 --> 00:37:48,330
Scott: you make a website a home page.

496
00:37:48,531 --> 00:37:51,520
Scott: We called it home pages because that was your home on the internet.

497
00:37:52,002 --> 00:37:56,175
Scott: if anyone wanted to find your shit They would had to come to you.

498
00:37:56,195 --> 00:37:59,163
Scott: Yeah, I'd your shit that you published yourself.

499
00:37:59,545 --> 00:38:01,390
Scott: No one can take your shit down.

500
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:06,849
Scott: It's your website as long as your entire website isn't taken down by your hosting provider.

501
00:38:07,713 --> 00:38:10,850
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, which is pretty rare, right?

502
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:16,790
Scott: It's like I'm sure even Nazis can you know, usually sometimes get away with hosting somewhere in some country.

503
00:38:17,096 --> 00:38:20,710
Scott: Yeah It's like you're you're good.

504
00:38:20,953 --> 00:38:24,710
Scott: It's like, you know You don't have to worry about some YouTube copyright bullshit.

505
00:38:24,851 --> 00:38:32,887
Scott: if you publish the videos on your own website, someone could come and sue you directly, but It's probably not gonna happen because how are they gonna find your videos?

506
00:38:33,048 --> 00:38:43,930
Rym: Yep So imagine I don't know a long-form content in a tweet like a tweet thread or something and then the where we got lazy I would just buy would just make a Twitter thread and that's it.

507
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:47,110
Rym: That's the only place that exists and then it gets taken down and I'm screwed.

508
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,018
Rym: So instead I post on my own site.

509
00:38:49,038 --> 00:38:51,369
Rym: It doesn't matter how I could be a microblog.

510
00:38:51,389 --> 00:38:51,710
Rym: Who cares?

511
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:57,679
Rym: I put that content here from recruit comm Slash blog like to forex time some URL.

512
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:07,304
Scott: that is your URL a URL that you control where the official Original version of that content is posted and always available as long as you can keep that website up.

513
00:39:07,384 --> 00:39:09,570
Scott: Rym comm slash Rym's tweet.

514
00:39:09,911 --> 00:39:12,779
Rym: Yep, so then how do people find it?

515
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:16,650
Rym: because the a lot of the times the reason people start using about discovery later.

516
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:28,423
Rym: yeah, well in terms of syndicate elsewhere means I post here on my website, but I cross-post from my website to all the other places.

517
00:39:28,463 --> 00:39:35,890
Rym: I want this content to appear and more importantly I Link back to my own website if you keep its pot if it's feet.

518
00:39:36,392 --> 00:39:40,110
Rym: There's a lot of edge cases in like two-way communication and like reply.

519
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:44,530
Rym: There's a lot of nuance we can get into but the idea is my kind of my tweet post.

520
00:39:44,752 --> 00:39:46,350
Rym: Yeah, my blog post is on my website.

521
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:49,590
Rym: My blog post is also on Twitter with a link back to my website.

522
00:39:49,931 --> 00:39:54,630
Rym: My blog post is also I don't know on Instagram as a photo with a link back to my website.

523
00:39:54,951 --> 00:39:56,777
Rym: Let's say the tweet gets taken down.

524
00:39:57,118 --> 00:40:00,790
Rym: Well people can still find the URL to my site and the Instagram.

525
00:40:01,991 --> 00:40:03,580
Scott: It's on on your discord server.

526
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,350
Scott: There's a link to your blog post.

527
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,502
Scott: Maybe the entire text gets copied there in a.

528
00:40:07,643 --> 00:40:12,530
Rym: in our worst case I make a torrent that within I make a distributed torrent.

529
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:17,086
Rym: That is just a URL linking to my post in a text file like.

530
00:40:17,106 --> 00:40:18,330
Rym: there's ways to get it out there.

531
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:19,275
Scott: Still use right.

532
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,903
Scott: other people are not going to.

533
00:40:21,024 --> 00:40:25,261
Scott: you know, noticeably, you know Necessarily know your website or come to it on purpose, right?

534
00:40:25,562 --> 00:40:27,890
Scott: They want to use the systems that they use.

535
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,900
Scott: Maybe someone out there wants to use an RSS reader.

536
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,281
Scott: Well good.

537
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,010
Scott: You have an RSS feed, right?

538
00:40:32,311 --> 00:40:39,170
Scott: You know, whatever someone wants to use you just make a link or a complete copy of your content with or without a link.

539
00:40:39,713 --> 00:40:49,409
Scott: Right and you post it on every other platform automatically, but your own website is the original source for that content and you just keep it up and you don't let it go.

540
00:40:49,429 --> 00:40:51,233
Scott: and That's that.

541
00:40:51,273 --> 00:40:53,523
Scott: and that's the rest the way GeekNights has always done it.

542
00:40:53,563 --> 00:40:58,025
Scott: We did all of our Content and podcasts on our website that no one goes to.

543
00:40:58,267 --> 00:41:03,106
Rym: every URL Thanks to a lot of hard work by Scott is still valid to this day.

544
00:41:03,126 --> 00:41:04,210
Scott: Yeah, it's a huge.

545
00:41:04,552 --> 00:41:07,470
Scott: That's part of the new website trouble trying to keep all these URLs working.

546
00:41:07,651 --> 00:41:10,789
Rym: I mean what 95% of all our thing of the day links are broken.

547
00:41:11,851 --> 00:41:12,775
Scott: You know, we're working on that too.

548
00:41:12,795 --> 00:41:14,782
Rym: Yeah, you know who else did this?

549
00:41:14,883 --> 00:41:16,810
Rym: very well the same model.

550
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:21,510
Rym: They followed it up until they didn't and them not doing it destroyed them College Humor.

551
00:41:23,153 --> 00:41:28,041
Rym: College Humor followed that model Religiously and I credit that as a big part of their success.

552
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:37,230
Rym: screw attack originally was like that too But then in the pivot to video they ended up putting their content primarily on platforms and then those platforms fuck them over.

553
00:41:37,731 --> 00:41:40,379
Rym: But they'd already sent their audience to those platforms.

554
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,829
Rym: So no one even knew to go back to their website and they were done.

555
00:41:44,925 --> 00:41:51,239
Scott: Yep So, you know, this is basically if you are a publisher of content This is the right way to do things.

556
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:58,850
Scott: if you're a reader of content Well now we have problems right because who's gonna actually go to all these different fucking websites, right?

557
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:04,689
Scott: It's like if you think about all the stuff that you're looking at on your your feeds that are automatically collated for you.

558
00:42:05,071 --> 00:42:17,772
Scott: All right, it's like unless all these websites out there make RSS feeds the right way, you know And even then it's like you're not gonna be able to you know Go and collect all of these into one place to read them all easily Right.

559
00:42:18,154 --> 00:42:21,388
Scott: So, you know, I guess you're just hoping that people all use.

560
00:42:21,468 --> 00:42:28,390
Scott: I guess You know if you you pick your platform of say Instagram and you hope that everyone you care about following is cross posting there, right?

561
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:33,303
Scott: Automatically somehow, you know, it's it becomes a huge pain visiting websites.

562
00:42:33,543 --> 00:42:35,950
Scott: is you know time-consuming to even remember webkit?

563
00:42:36,171 --> 00:42:38,219
Scott: You know, I tried web comics back in the day.

564
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:40,870
Scott: web comics are the ultimate at following the posse model.

565
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:45,765
Scott: They almost right they were pretty much all of them posted on their own site and syndicated elsewhere.

566
00:42:45,846 --> 00:42:52,167
Scott: until the past You know few years they started posting only on you know, the platforms directly.

567
00:42:52,187 --> 00:42:56,028
Scott: Yeah But it's like I want.

568
00:42:56,048 --> 00:43:03,636
Scott: you know There were people who try to make web comic aggregators because the web comics are really bad about making it easy to read all the web comics at once.

569
00:43:03,756 --> 00:43:11,304
Scott: and now you've got shit like webtoon and it's like people just post a comic on webtoon and If something happens to webtoon all those comics are gone.

570
00:43:11,345 --> 00:43:12,518
Rym: I think a lot of that Again.

571
00:43:15,691 --> 00:43:18,560
Rym: Why did people like shut down RSS feeds?

572
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:18,740
Rym: like.

573
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:22,030
Rym: why did RSS feeds as we knew them back in the day mostly die?

574
00:43:22,352 --> 00:43:30,390
Rym: Because if anyone looks at your content via an RSS feed They didn't see the ads that you were using to make money because no one has any other way to make money with anything online.

575
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,026
Scott: Yep How was that?

576
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:34,553
Scott: People blame like.

577
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:37,622
Scott: the death of Google Reader is like the death of RSS and it's like.

578
00:43:38,224 --> 00:43:39,729
Scott: no there were still plenty of other.

579
00:43:39,789 --> 00:43:42,630
Scott: reader Software is available at the time, right?

580
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:49,450
Scott: Yeah, the death of RSS was because there was other ways to get a feed of data that appeared.

581
00:43:49,832 --> 00:43:50,454
Scott: You know, when did?

582
00:43:50,495 --> 00:43:51,881
Scott: when did Google Reader shut down?

583
00:43:51,901 --> 00:44:02,350
Rym: I would argue that the death of That kind of syndication as platforms move toward aggressive ad monetization is why Google Reader died and not the other way around.

584
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:08,052
Scott: Yeah, Google Reader ended in In 2013.

585
00:44:08,052 --> 00:44:11,844
Rym: oh my god, I just turned into a skeleton hearing that year right.

586
00:44:11,925 --> 00:44:25,439
Rym: Twitter started in 2006 right and remember for the first couple years It was like SMS only and there was an iOS app that kind of worked and that was it didn't even work Android yet The point is by 2013, right?

587
00:44:25,479 --> 00:44:26,965
Scott: What was it that killed Google Reader?

588
00:44:26,985 --> 00:44:28,290
Scott: It wasn't right.

589
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:33,370
Scott: It wasn't the fact that you know Google think like RSS didn't die because Google Reader shut down.

590
00:44:33,892 --> 00:44:36,890
Scott: It's they shut down Google Reader because Twitter was here, right?

591
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:41,944
Rym: that's why there was nothing for any RSS feed aggregator to look at anymore.

592
00:44:41,964 --> 00:44:48,346
Rym: like everyone shut down their RSS feeds or They reduced their RSS feeds to contentless links back to the platform.

593
00:44:48,366 --> 00:44:58,490
Scott: They posted to Yep Which I guess web scraped but I suppose I mean there are still RSS readers out there.

594
00:44:58,611 --> 00:44:59,356
Scott: I still use one.

595
00:44:59,416 --> 00:45:02,934
Scott: it still works right, but you know, you can't Some of them like.

596
00:45:02,974 --> 00:45:06,210
Scott: let you incorporate, you know, Twitter's and reddit's and all these sorts of things.

597
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:12,898
Rym: I feel like we did a GeekNights episode when Google Reader died Explaining that Google Reader did not kill RSS by dying.

598
00:45:12,938 --> 00:45:17,290
Rym: Google did not kill RSS capitalism did but that episode was probably a long time.

599
00:45:18,434 --> 00:45:22,570
Scott: Well, the other thing is that you know, if your people post on the platforms, right?

600
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:26,610
Scott: It's like well the platforms aren't gonna make RSS because then they lose all their value, right?

601
00:45:27,132 --> 00:45:32,650
Scott: It's it's like why would anyone go to Twitter if Twitter had an RSS feed for every single Twitter account?

602
00:45:32,951 --> 00:45:33,333
Rym: I would now?

603
00:45:33,353 --> 00:45:33,916
Rym: I would never.

604
00:45:33,996 --> 00:45:38,879
Rym: I would literally just have an ad free RSS feed Interlinking Twitter with all the other shit.

605
00:45:38,899 --> 00:45:41,550
Rym: I read I wouldn't even know that content came from Twitter.

606
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:42,514
Scott: Then all the plat.

607
00:45:42,735 --> 00:45:47,253
Scott: if this RSS or anything like it all the platforms just become dumb pipes They don't.

608
00:45:47,595 --> 00:45:50,390
Scott: they don't have any way to make money or extract value or anything.

609
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:55,629
Scott: They're just dumb pipes sending feeds of data, you know between people's.

610
00:45:56,151 --> 00:46:09,542
Scott: everyone would choose whatever client software for reading they liked the most and choose whatever software they like for publishing the most and Publish anywhere and read anywhere and all the different services would just be you know Funneling that data around and that would be it.

611
00:46:09,622 --> 00:46:11,030
Scott: and they know they don't want that to happen, right?

612
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:17,393
Scott: That's why they won't let everyone like use the Twitter API unlimitedly even though it's like Why not?

613
00:46:17,514 --> 00:46:24,390
Scott: I can the only even if the only functions I could do with the Twitter API are the same Functions that I could do with a Twitter client.

614
00:46:24,691 --> 00:46:32,339
Scott: They can't allow that because being able to automate those functions Means I don't have to go to the Twitter website or see the ads or etc.

615
00:46:32,379 --> 00:46:32,980
Rym: Etc, right?

616
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:41,851
Scott: hmm Anyway, so I think the thing is if the whole world were to do everything the way we say right with it with a posse Model, right?

617
00:46:42,192 --> 00:46:45,836
Scott: First of all, all the services become dumb pipes like we just said.

618
00:46:45,856 --> 00:46:50,366
Scott: right but the real problem is Discoverability, right?

619
00:46:50,386 --> 00:47:00,300
Scott: So it's like, okay if you stick with one platform Right, the platforms have many ways to sort of over solve the problem of discovery, right?

620
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,389
Rym: I would say that it's not even over solving.

621
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:12,940
Rym: the platforms have a vested interest in Keeping you on the platform and tailoring the platform to you to make sure you never go to any other platforms, right?

622
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:33,651
Scott: So it's like if you go to Twitter, you know They start suggesting people to follow and you know YouTube is showing you videos from channels that you don't subscribe to and You know They're trying to get you to put your contacts in to help you find your friends and they're showing Tweets your friends liked or tweets your friends retweeted or you know They're always trying to show you some kind of content.

623
00:47:34,032 --> 00:47:39,693
Scott: That isn't just the content you follow Explicitly and nothing else which is what RSS does.

624
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:40,476
Scott: Yeah, it goes.

625
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:49,780
Scott: so It's like it's hard not to discover new content because it's just being shoved in your face because that's how they keep you there.

626
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,367
Scott: That's how they make money right?

627
00:47:51,749 --> 00:47:54,380
Scott: if everyone has just got their own websites, right?

628
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,080
Scott: Forget the problem of the technical difficulties of normal people not being able to host their own websites.

629
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:02,559
Scott: It's like how do you find shit?

630
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:07,071
Scott: Well, Google Google is how you find shit or I could see one.

631
00:48:07,472 --> 00:48:11,403
Rym: we would have an industry arise around Curation.

632
00:48:11,584 --> 00:48:19,154
Scott: people would seek out the people who were good at telling them what to look at And I don't think so because that would have happened back in the day and it didn't.

633
00:48:19,214 --> 00:48:20,380
Rym: yeah, I saw it happen.

634
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:35,920
Rym: hmm, I Also think you would see companies could try to make meta algorithms that try to do try to find good content Across all the platforms for target to do that and probably charge subscription fees for that.

635
00:48:37,285 --> 00:48:40,497
Scott: Hmm I think the real end result is is a good result, which is that like?

636
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:49,824
Scott: yeah Discovering new things would mean explicit effort on the part of the reader as opposed to advertising or other push-based things Intruding like.

637
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:53,580
Scott: I support order for your feed to get more full of data.

638
00:48:53,841 --> 00:49:11,100
Scott: you would have to go out and explicitly find a thing that you liked and intentionally and Only and then you would see more of that and that only and giving us, you know the pull instead of the push.

639
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,786
Scott: No one's pushing content on you.

640
00:49:13,087 --> 00:49:16,500
Scott: You are choosing what to see and not seeing anything else.

641
00:49:16,708 --> 00:49:19,548
Scott: Yeah And therefore you're seeing less.

642
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:20,571
Scott: everyone to be seeing less.

643
00:49:20,771 --> 00:49:28,214
Scott: a lot less spending a lot less time doom scrolling on their phone Spending a lot less time reading fake news or whatever other nonsense, right?

644
00:49:28,756 --> 00:49:29,940
Scott: It would just be better, right?

645
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:33,179
Scott: We don't know we're reading too much shit.

646
00:49:33,561 --> 00:49:39,260
Scott: It's like the you know, yeah have gone through even before all these, you know collapses that are happening.

647
00:49:39,742 --> 00:49:43,939
Scott: I went through all of my you know, social, you know platform things.

648
00:49:43,959 --> 00:49:47,014
Scott: I Deleted slash uninstalled several of them.

649
00:49:47,155 --> 00:49:47,840
Rym: Yeah, I did.

650
00:49:48,502 --> 00:49:53,580
Rym: I would like semi-annually do a big purge of all the things I followed all the things I use.

651
00:49:53,981 --> 00:49:57,432
Scott: I would delete apps all the all the ones that I kept using.

652
00:49:57,472 --> 00:49:58,676
Scott: I'm still got Twitter here.

653
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:04,096
Scott: I've unfollowed Unfollowed like 33% of the people I was following on Twitter and then I unfollowed again 33% more.

654
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:12,356
Rym: It's actually I straight-up deleted the Twitter app, but I mean this was you know while ago Yeah, but now like everyone like once a day.

655
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:21,600
Rym: I look at it But like I'm dropping other platforms to not just Twitter, even though there's nothing wrong with those platforms They're not really doing anything useful for me, right?

656
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,013
Scott: There were people that I was following and I looked and I said I see that person.

657
00:50:25,274 --> 00:50:26,820
Scott: I did follow them with intent.

658
00:50:27,141 --> 00:50:30,115
Scott: Yes, I enjoy what that person does.

659
00:50:30,135 --> 00:50:31,100
Rym: I like that person.

660
00:50:31,863 --> 00:50:39,047
Scott: I like that person and then I look at the content that they're putting into the feed and I'm like is This content that they're putting into the feed.

661
00:50:39,147 --> 00:50:41,676
Scott: Is this really do I need this in my life?

662
00:50:41,816 --> 00:50:42,920
Scott: Am I personally?

663
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:49,620
Scott: Getting value, you know, even if I love this person am I getting value from this information?

664
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:52,069
Scott: This is information that I need to know right?

665
00:50:52,109 --> 00:50:53,534
Scott: that helps me in my life.

666
00:50:53,855 --> 00:50:55,100
Scott: That's important, right?

667
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:57,713
Scott: Is it even entertained like, you know, yep, like it could be.

668
00:50:57,733 --> 00:50:59,240
Rym: do I want or entertaining enough?

669
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,604
Rym: Does it make me smile?

670
00:51:00,705 --> 00:51:01,989
Rym: Does it make me smile enough?

671
00:51:02,371 --> 00:51:03,415
Rym: Like there's a lot there.

672
00:51:03,455 --> 00:51:04,780
Scott: It's like a lot of it.

673
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,780
Scott: It's like yeah, it may have at one point, but it doesn't anymore.

674
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,025
Scott: It's like only get.

675
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:11,695
Scott: why am I spending time in my short short life on it?

676
00:51:11,856 --> 00:51:12,800
Scott: Get it out of here, right?

677
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:14,284
Scott: It's like sorry.

678
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:28,958
Scott: Bye, you know, and I think a lot of people are not doing this but a change of you know The dynamics of the platforms could force people to do that and we bet be better for a lot of people Probably improve the world this way.

679
00:51:29,975 --> 00:51:44,760
Scott: so Yeah, if you're publishing I highly recommend right, you know following the posse model that GeekNights has mostly strictly followed to its benefit because it's not suffering at all and Personally, I did not follow strictly enough.

680
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:51,184
Scott: But now having learned the lesson of being alive to see so many platforms fail I will now follow.

681
00:51:51,225 --> 00:52:00,420
Scott: I'm gonna work towards following that policy very strictly with myself Personally and with GeekNights for the rest of my life and it won't matter to me when platforms come and go.

682
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,107
Scott: I think both of us syndicating to them or not.

683
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:06,977
Rym: Twitter was the one we both got the laxest with like.

684
00:52:07,018 --> 00:52:08,824
Rym: that was the one Tumblr.

685
00:52:08,844 --> 00:52:11,095
Rym: a couple dozen posts is all I made there.

686
00:52:11,155 --> 00:52:12,019
Rym: That's no big loss.

687
00:52:14,077 --> 00:52:21,720
Scott: But Yeah, and then if you are a reader right what I would suggest you do is You know, you're gonna have to choose, you know for yourself, right?

688
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:25,856
Scott: Which platform is the one that has the most like nicest reading experience for you?

689
00:52:26,037 --> 00:52:26,780
Scott: or you know?

690
00:52:26,961 --> 00:52:28,620
Scott: Think about who you're gonna fall.

691
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,186
Scott: Don't worry about what platform they're on.

692
00:52:30,227 --> 00:52:33,360
Scott: think about who and what you really care about.

693
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:56,620
Scott: That's really important in your life that you need to follow and know about and then you know You're gonna have to find some balance between you know Seeing where those people or organizations or groups are publishing and syndicating to and you know what platforms you're willing to participate in in order to get at what they're publishing and Maybe have to miss some people that you care about.

694
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,492
Scott: maybe you have to add a platform that you read from that you don't really like.

695
00:53:00,553 --> 00:53:08,880
Scott: but the people you care about are on there and You know, hopefully enough people that you follow will follow the posse model, right?

696
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,940
Scott: We'll publish and syndicate to enough platforms to give you know.

697
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,848
Scott: That's like I'm just publishing.

698
00:53:14,868 --> 00:53:16,255
Scott: to all these platforms at least ones.

699
00:53:16,295 --> 00:53:17,480
Scott: I find acceptable.

700
00:53:17,821 --> 00:53:28,986
Scott: it's like I'm gonna give the people who care to hear what I have to say as much choice as I can give them in terms of you know, how they want to follow me and then you know It'll be up to them.

701
00:53:29,107 --> 00:53:30,617
Scott: and I think it's like I don't want.

702
00:53:30,698 --> 00:53:34,959
Scott: you know A lot of people out there are trying to get followers, right?

703
00:53:35,783 --> 00:53:39,074
Scott: It's like I don't think that's not gonna work and that's good.

704
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:40,560
Scott: I think that that's not gonna work, right?

705
00:53:41,361 --> 00:53:46,678
Scott: it's like I only want someone following me if for some reason I don't can't explain.

706
00:53:46,698 --> 00:53:50,909
Scott: they Really really enjoy whatever hearing what I have to say.

707
00:53:50,969 --> 00:53:55,192
Rym: Yeah, but this will have a lot of consequences that are probably unavoidable.

708
00:53:55,253 --> 00:54:04,200
Rym: for example A lot of indie creators reach their audiences by putting their like links to their store Interleaved with their regular social media content.

709
00:54:04,587 --> 00:54:14,119
Rym: But yeah A lot of people in the post Twitter world might just decide they don't want to see the store links so they just won't see that person's content anymore like I think we're gonna see a lot of.

710
00:54:14,862 --> 00:54:19,259
Rym: This is gonna be a very big impact on how people use the internet over the coming year.

711
00:54:20,421 --> 00:54:23,939
Rym: Yeah, you know, it's like if you're it's the biggest platform to fail in a long time.

712
00:54:24,782 --> 00:54:29,800
Scott: We talked about that, you know with the with you know, I said the visual studio plug-in story.

713
00:54:30,121 --> 00:54:37,627
Scott: It's like yeah, if you were depending on platforms that are failing to make your monies and Those platforms are failing.

714
00:54:37,668 --> 00:54:45,860
Scott: It's like yeah, that's that's what happens You know, it sucks because most of those creators are decent people doing good works, right?

715
00:54:46,501 --> 00:54:51,077
Scott: And you know, they're gonna make less money is just because the place that they were using to.

716
00:54:51,198 --> 00:54:56,040
Scott: you know publish about themselves is failing but But it implies something.

717
00:54:56,140 --> 00:55:03,424
Rym: Patreon goes down if it implies something that we've talked about when we've talked about advertising Many times over the years.

718
00:55:03,946 --> 00:55:22,289
Rym: There are a lot of people who if they are presented with like an ad Even if it's a subtle ad like a friend posting in their stream to a store link or something they can buy They might just buy it Whereas if that had not been pushed in front of them They would not have sought it out and bought it on their own.

719
00:55:22,329 --> 00:55:31,047
Rym: that sale was predicated on putting it in front of them Against their sort of explicit intention to see it Exactly, right.

720
00:55:31,108 --> 00:55:36,540
Scott: if you made for example Let's say indie video games, right?

721
00:55:36,661 --> 00:55:41,080
Scott: So it's like you go to itch IO and I guess itch IO does sort of try to suggest games to you.

722
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:50,793
Scott: I mean steam tries to suggest games to me Sure, but let's imagine, you know an itch IO equivalent right where you only see games from people you follow and that's it right.

723
00:55:51,439 --> 00:55:58,660
Scott: and So it's like you're only gonna buy a game if you are somebody who cares enough to even go to this website.

724
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:05,380
Scott: You care enough about playing and buying indie games that you're gonna become a member of this indie game specific site, right?

725
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:23,460
Scott: You're gonna follow people so that you learned about somehow right that you you like them enough that you've sought them out and click to follow button and You visit the website enough and frequently enough and on top of that The thing they make has to catch your eye in your feed and make you want to buy it enough, right?

726
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:28,760
Scott: Whereas you know, it's like that's sort of actually the right way that things should be done.

727
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:32,775
Scott: You shouldn't be buying something unless you really care about it that it's like.

728
00:56:32,815 --> 00:56:34,160
Scott: to that extent, you know.

729
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:42,460
Scott: Yeah, but the way things are now it's like okay you live your life on Twitter where there are many people that you know You're following for various reasons, right?

730
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:48,940
Scott: Some of them might retweet shit from someone you don't even follow right and you're following that person.

731
00:56:49,181 --> 00:56:54,239
Scott: Maybe you know, they don't think like that's a person that using my requirements you I wouldn't even follow them.

732
00:56:54,862 --> 00:57:02,119
Scott: And there's they retweet something that gets in the feed and there it is along with everything else and it catches your eye And you end up buying it.

733
00:57:03,022 --> 00:57:05,920
Scott: It's like maybe that was a valuable thing, right?

734
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:30,635
Scott: Maybe you did discover something you never knew about and that brought You know improved your life or and brought you joy and you wouldn't have had it without this right and that's that's a good thing right, but maybe because of you know, you got you ended up buying something because you know ads work and human psychology and this thing popped up and You know took your money impulse buy and it sat on your shelf and you never cared about it.

735
00:57:30,715 --> 00:57:31,618
Scott: It's just there right?

736
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,030
Scott: It's like you shouldn't have bought that.

737
00:57:34,091 --> 00:57:34,634
Rym: Yeah, right.

738
00:57:34,654 --> 00:57:46,014
Scott: Yeah And that's you know, and then so I think will the world be better, you know with the more stable Only buying things that you it's bad for the economy.

739
00:57:46,054 --> 00:57:46,596
Scott: That's for sure.

740
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:53,319
Rym: overall Yeah, I mean capitalism as it is is one of the underlying causes of us even having this entire conversation today.

741
00:57:54,081 --> 00:57:56,348
Scott: Well, it's the entire cause of everything.

742
00:57:56,368 --> 00:58:00,260
Scott: Yeah, at least if the society is capitalist then yes, everything is capitalist.

743
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:05,120
Rym: You know all this implies to me is you should probably play disco Elysium.

744
00:58:06,023 --> 00:58:07,298
Rym: That's all I'm gonna say about that.

745
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:12,899
Scott: Yeah, I'm tired of people trying to push on me What content I should be playing?

746
00:58:15,021 --> 00:58:15,904
Scott: Not pushing on you.

747
00:58:15,924 --> 00:58:16,566
Scott: Yeah, you are.

748
00:58:16,766 --> 00:58:24,090
Scott: if I want to play something I'll explicitly go and follow the company that makes them And then I'll decide for myself if I like what I see.

749
00:58:24,211 --> 00:58:28,070
Rym: I bought it cuz it was on my crazy super sale and I'd Been wanting to buy it for a long time.

750
00:58:29,219 --> 00:58:31,509
Scott: Ah So something got popped up in the feed.

751
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:32,654
Rym: Well, it was.

752
00:58:32,935 --> 00:58:34,884
Rym: I had already wanted to buy it chosen.

753
00:58:35,348 --> 00:58:39,738
Rym: I want to play this game, but It costs more money than I was willing to pay.

754
00:58:39,758 --> 00:58:44,199
Rym: because you know We're both following the rule of never buy again on steam game on steam unless you're gonna play it right the fuck.

755
00:58:44,259 --> 00:58:46,897
Scott: now I'm just trying to tie into the real world.

756
00:58:46,937 --> 00:58:52,720
Rym: example Speaking of tying into the real world right now is where the ad read would happen in a normal podcast.

757
00:58:52,781 --> 00:58:54,092
Rym: But we don't do that shit and I'm hungry.

758
00:58:54,132 --> 00:58:54,939
Rym: So I think we should end the show.

Rym: We got good stuff going on in there But for not for tonight since Scott will never take any suggestion to play read or watch anything From any human being that he has ever met in person.

775
01:00:18,212 --> 01:00:28,055
Rym: I simply leave you with The lieutenant nods gravely as you erect tariffs against his apricots and sugar.

776
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:42,688
Rym: This is going to get ugly With every turn tariffs are raised until neither you nor the lieutenant are producing any income or generating resources for the suzerain Even in the best of cases.

777
01:00:42,969 --> 01:00:45,459
Rym: It's impossible to really win a trade war.

778
01:00:45,921 --> 01:00:54,043
Rym: But this is far from the best case and the lieutenant's apricot powered economic engine crushes yours Soon.

779
01:00:54,223 --> 01:00:58,320
Rym: your covers are empty and the map lies strewn with your worker tokens.

780
01:00:59,344 --> 01:01:00,439
Rym: I hope you learned your lesson.
