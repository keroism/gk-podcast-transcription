1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,413
Rym: It's Monday April 6th 2015.

2
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:12,874
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,215 --> 00:00:18,410
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight FPGAs and all those related things.

4
00:00:22,881 --> 00:00:26,408
Rym: Let's do this Been a while.

5
00:00:26,428 --> 00:00:28,563
Rym: since we've done a Monday show It's just every like.

6
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:33,460
Rym: the weeks we kept missing happened to be weeks where we'd come back on a Tuesday Thursday.

7
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:36,875
Scott: That's generally how things work if you go away on a weekend.

8
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:41,039
Scott: Monday's a bad day Yeah, also Monday's the day with the least ideas.

9
00:00:41,902 --> 00:00:44,128
Scott: Well, they were the most likely to bail on it.

10
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:46,936
Rym: We came up with this idea behind the last show.

11
00:00:46,956 --> 00:00:49,679
Rym: sure and Thank the gods.

12
00:00:50,061 --> 00:00:54,652
Rym: Convention season is done for us until July with Connecticut.

13
00:00:54,712 --> 00:00:56,837
Scott: Yeah, I mean usually convention season is summer.

14
00:00:57,198 --> 00:00:57,920
Scott: usually, right?

15
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,702
Scott: That's what you know.

16
00:00:58,722 --> 00:01:02,194
Rym: We always say usually it was usually for us like five years ago.

17
00:01:02,214 --> 00:01:15,253
Scott: I'm saying conventions originally Historically, we're all mostly in the summer and the big ones still are the you know, the Gen cons the San Diego comic cons Whatever, but the big summer cons that we used to go to we stopped going to.

18
00:01:15,554 --> 00:01:17,100
Scott: conventions are supposed to be in the summer.

19
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,714
Scott: That's when kids aren't in school so they can go.

20
00:01:19,734 --> 00:01:20,538
Scott: wait a minute.

21
00:01:20,578 --> 00:01:22,685
Scott: Wait a minute They can go.

22
00:01:22,746 --> 00:01:23,389
Rym: by that logic.

23
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:27,022
Rym: I only want conventions that are during school Sure.

24
00:01:27,423 --> 00:01:30,195
Scott: I'm just saying if you're the convention runner you want to get the most people to come.

25
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,360
Scott: they're usually in summer.

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:40,370
Scott: But all the other conventions the ones we go to mostly had to abandon summer to get away from the mega Conventions that were in the summer taking up all the people's.

27
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:44,920
Scott: so we end up going like a bunch of spring conventions and winter conventions.

28
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:47,311
Scott: Pax prime is the very end of summer.

29
00:01:47,713 --> 00:01:49,160
Scott: Pax East is like an enemy.

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,960
Scott: I was like the beginning of spring and then what made it was pushed to the edges of the summer.

31
00:01:53,201 --> 00:02:04,980
Rym: Because there are four Pax's and they're in different parts of the country or the world They end up like they can be clustered way outside of the norm of like of the convention circuit in the Northeast.

32
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,039
Scott: But this is fine by me because it means I don't have to do anything in summer except enjoy summer.

33
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,180
Scott: I don't have like to abandon some awesome summer weekend to go stay in a giant building somewhere.

34
00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:15,265
Rym: But yeah, I'm gonna.

35
00:02:15,446 --> 00:02:18,020
Rym: I'll keep it short because it's not gonna turn into the biking show.

36
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,391
Rym: But today was the first day first day of the season.

37
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:23,317
Rym: I biked to work still too cold.

38
00:02:23,778 --> 00:02:24,300
Rym: What the fuck?

39
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,725
Rym: It's like 60 degrees.

40
00:02:26,006 --> 00:02:28,675
Scott: Yeah, which means when you bike it's like 45 degrees Scott.

41
00:02:28,896 --> 00:02:30,281
Rym: You're you're a little baby Like.

42
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:31,026
Rym: I don't even know what to say.

43
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:33,120
Scott: I'm gonna shave your head and then I'm gonna send you bike.

44
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,803
Rym: We're a hat.

45
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:34,849
Rym: you gotta wear a helmet.

46
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:36,880
Scott: Anyway, a hat is not good.

47
00:02:37,302 --> 00:02:41,140
Rym: I mean I biked to work today and there's no happy medium either.

48
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:43,073
Scott: Your head is melting because you put a hat on.

49
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:44,080
Rym: my head is not the factory.

50
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:47,565
Rym: I was wearing shorts in a t-shirt Like I was wearing a button shirt.

51
00:02:47,826 --> 00:02:49,892
Rym: that I got hot and I unbuttoned.

52
00:02:49,992 --> 00:02:52,159
Scott: did the bridge not blowing mighty wind across?

53
00:02:52,279 --> 00:02:52,620
Rym: it did.

54
00:02:52,821 --> 00:02:54,569
Rym: But you know what I was biking so hard.

55
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,574
Rym: I was still hot.

56
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:56,700
Scott: why are you biking so hard?

57
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,643
Rym: I always like it Scott.

58
00:02:57,864 --> 00:02:59,149
Rym: So this is the most awesome.

59
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,719
Rym: I biked to working back today and I got used to Strava.

60
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:06,185
Rym: running hard all winter Really paid off.

61
00:03:06,627 --> 00:03:18,985
Rym: my time not only didn't go down significantly over the winter But my first commute home from work took 30 minutes and historically my best time ever Was 26 minutes.

62
00:03:19,145 --> 00:03:20,709
Scott: my commute is about 30 minutes.

63
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,958
Rym: my commute six points eight six point eight miles.

64
00:03:24,118 --> 00:03:24,820
Scott: Mine's five miles.

65
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:25,949
Rym: Yeah, five miles.

66
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:26,333
Rym: Really?

67
00:03:26,534 --> 00:03:29,644
Rym: Yeah It takes you fall.

68
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,869
Rym: I guess you got that Astoria stuff.

69
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:31,531
Scott: Mm-hmm.

70
00:03:32,113 --> 00:03:33,659
Rym: So can you do six point eight miles in?

71
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:35,204
Rym: 26 minutes.

72
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:36,689
Scott: I don't buy card.

73
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:39,660
Scott: I just sort of mosey and it takes me 30 minutes to do five miles.

74
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,727
Scott: So I don't know how fast I would go.

75
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:43,432
Scott: as if I was trying.

76
00:03:43,452 --> 00:03:49,608
Rym: I always bike to damage my body So I don't bike to damage heart like damage levels.

77
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:50,692
Rym: I bike to hard levels.

78
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:51,374
Rym: I bike to.

79
00:03:51,915 --> 00:03:53,400
Rym: how fast can I go?

80
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,746
Rym: Without getting to the point where I cannot breathe fast enough to replenish oxygen I do not exert myself.

81
00:04:00,168 --> 00:04:04,000
Scott: I exert myself to the point at which if I exerted any more I would feel uncomfortable.

82
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:06,349
Scott: I do not feel uncomfortable at any time.

83
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:07,835
Rym: You still want to do that race?

84
00:04:08,036 --> 00:04:09,080
Rym: I don't think we should race.

85
00:04:09,462 --> 00:04:11,494
Rym: What kind of race we were talking last year?

86
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:12,380
Rym: We would do a race.

87
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,948
Rym: We're just we both leave at the same time.

88
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,459
Rym: first one to the sand and rock away.

89
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,447
Rym: Sure, take any route you want.

90
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:19,070
Scott: Sure.

91
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:19,994
Rym: You wanna race?

92
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:20,536
Rym: You wanna do it?

93
00:04:21,038 --> 00:04:21,399
Scott: Yeah, why not?

94
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,429
Rym: We should both go pro it giving commentary the whole way.

95
00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:27,560
Scott: So this is the shortcut I'm taking and I'm moseying along.

96
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,893
Scott: Meanwhile Rym pushed himself way hard and he's on the bridge.

97
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:30,536
Scott: He's dying.

98
00:04:30,556 --> 00:04:36,588
Scott: dying You mean winning and here's me catching up to him on the bridge just sort of moseying and I'm behind him and I pushed him Off the bridge.

99
00:04:36,648 --> 00:04:37,883
Scott: now he can't win You would.

100
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:38,628
Rym: the thing is you wouldn't.

101
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,444
Rym: we would not be on the bridge at the same time You wouldn't be able to push me off.

102
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:42,226
Scott: Uh-huh.

103
00:04:42,508 --> 00:04:45,940
Rym: My main strategy when there's danger is to run away faster than whoever it is.

104
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,705
Rym: He's trying to hurt me.

105
00:04:46,725 --> 00:04:47,551
Rym: Mm-hmm.

106
00:04:48,357 --> 00:04:52,279
Scott: Well good I'll just I'll just stay right behind you until you pass out and then go to the beach.

107
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,566
Rym: Yeah, unlike my man Midosuji.

108
00:04:54,606 --> 00:04:57,275
Rym: I think I think I can power through to the end.

109
00:04:57,315 --> 00:05:01,956
Rym: That's what Midosuji thought too Yeah, but he wasn't as powerful as I am apparently.

110
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:08,958
Rym: Okay Yeah You got any news on this tech Monday back from anime Boston back from zinc icon.

111
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:11,391
Scott: It's News, I don't know.

112
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:19,520
Scott: It might actually be an old thing That was just recently again re brought up on the internet or it might be new on it I can't tell but it's just kind of cool.

113
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,907
Scott: Estonia a country on the other side of the world You know, I'm sure this country has problems.

114
00:05:26,948 --> 00:05:30,400
Scott: I'm actually gonna be honest and say I don't know a whole lot about Estonia.

115
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:31,925
Scott: I know it's in Eastern Europe.

116
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:36,260
Rym: It is perhaps a member of the Baltic states as along with Latvia and Lithuania.

117
00:05:36,442 --> 00:05:37,736
Scott: Yes, that is about all I know.

118
00:05:39,142 --> 00:05:41,053
Scott: But I know one more thing about Estonia now.

119
00:05:41,396 --> 00:05:42,822
Rym: super techie It's.

120
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:52,512
Rym: I mean the whole Eastern Europe is pretty techie, but it's still in a different way than we are and above other states is Particularly techie at the government level.

121
00:05:52,693 --> 00:05:53,900
Rym: sure has been for a long time.

122
00:05:53,920 --> 00:06:07,680
Scott: So one thing Estonia offers and it sounds awesome when you hear what it is, which it's less awesome in reality is E-residency, so at first you're thinking holy shit I could be an Estonia resident but digitally and not have to go there and that is sort of true.

123
00:06:08,404 --> 00:06:10,174
Scott: But it's not as awesome as you would think.

124
00:06:10,214 --> 00:06:13,200
Scott: but at the same time I mean most kid most punk kids out there.

125
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,340
Scott: I you know if they're like me when we were in our like sea land thinking days.

126
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,928
Scott: Yeah, they're thinking gonna renounce my u.s.

127
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:20,570
Scott: Citizenship.

128
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,516
Scott: I'll be in Estonia e-resident.

129
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:23,459
Scott: I'll live on the internet.

130
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,192
Scott: Sovereign citizen can't fuck with me, right?

131
00:06:27,232 --> 00:06:27,553
Scott: That's it.

132
00:06:27,573 --> 00:06:29,080
Scott: That's what the punk kids are thinking right now.

133
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,893
Scott: But sorry punk kids is not what this is.

134
00:06:31,014 --> 00:06:39,731
Rym: see sadly though I knew the thing that this was because I already knew about this from Estonia But because of what they're calling it.

135
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:42,780
Rym: It's not entirely obvious that it's the same thing right away, right?

136
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:51,435
Scott: So what this is is you become an Estonia e-resident you apply and they give you like a card and the card has some you Know digital keys in it, you know for.

137
00:06:51,677 --> 00:07:01,928
Scott: you know Secure signatures private public key deal and you can use that card with those keys to legally sign Documents like contracts in Estonia.

138
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:16,280
Scott: So this is ridiculously useful if you want to conduct business in Estonia like I'm a US citizen, but I want to open up an Estonian business or Open up a web store that sells things to Estonia or any sort of Estonian business deal.

139
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:17,226
Scott: Maybe I got a sign.

140
00:07:17,246 --> 00:07:18,596
Rym: while you know, look at the US.

141
00:07:18,656 --> 00:07:22,392
Rym: you either Scribble some ink on a dead tree.

142
00:07:22,412 --> 00:07:28,177
Rym: Yeah, or You try to use PGP signatures that no one can figure out.

143
00:07:28,418 --> 00:07:28,659
Scott: Mm-hmm.

144
00:07:29,222 --> 00:07:33,606
Rym: Or you have to use a hundred percent Adobe workflow And even then it's not like.

145
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:36,496
Rym: it's not the same level of cryptographic trust.

146
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:37,520
Scott: No, not really.

147
00:07:37,721 --> 00:07:40,278
Scott: It's also trust Adobe and government, right?

148
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:49,184
Scott: Yeah but yeah If you want to do business in Estonia You can get one of these things and it's really freaking useful and cool and modern and I don't know why every country doesn't have The US.

149
00:07:49,244 --> 00:07:50,528
Scott: every country is not Estonia.

150
00:07:50,609 --> 00:07:56,289
Rym: This should have appeared in the US like they're in the 90s But they banned exporting this encryption in the 90s.

151
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,935
Rym: That's why it was a weapon.

152
00:07:58,276 --> 00:07:58,717
Scott: Sure.

153
00:07:58,737 --> 00:08:01,620
Rym: Yeah Yeah, you know the Zimmerman stuff, right?

154
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:12,810
Rym: I mean I've said this for easily 20 years now the US when you're born instead of getting a piece of paper With a stamp printed you shouldn't need a bird.

155
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,900
Scott: You shouldn't need a birth certificate a driver's license a social security card.

156
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,365
Scott: You shouldn't need all these fucking cars.

157
00:08:17,385 --> 00:08:18,950
Rym: I'm specific one.

158
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:24,667
Scott: Yeah one government card one key on there that should do every single thing there is to do.

159
00:08:24,747 --> 00:08:30,203
Rym: every citizen when they're born should be given a private key and By the.

160
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:44,700
Rym: basically it's a thing that you can use to cryptographically not for like Hiding things not for like encrypting things but cryptographic signing so you can prove who you are And you can prove if you did something or not in an official capacity.

161
00:08:44,861 --> 00:08:46,407
Scott: It just needs two factors, you know.

162
00:08:46,628 --> 00:08:49,760
Scott: one the card itself with the keys, but these are encrypted.

163
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:53,157
Scott: So the second factor is the password to decrypt the key to do the signing.

164
00:08:53,197 --> 00:09:03,520
Rym: this technology Since the 80s and the fact that other than in Estonia It is not in common use for the things that it is better every human being on earth.

165
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,483
Rym: Yeah, it's like it.

166
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:05,145
Rym: this solves.

167
00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:05,586
Scott: Guess what?

168
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:09,539
Scott: There's plenty more keys than there will ever be human beings to ever exist.

169
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:21,120
Rym: this technology solves a Ridiculous number of the real-world problems that people in the industrialized world have been facing for a hundred years and Estonia is deploying it.

170
00:09:21,221 --> 00:09:21,959
Scott: So good job, Estonia.

171
00:09:22,241 --> 00:09:25,420
Scott: Yeah, you are inching up on the list of countries to run away to.

172
00:09:25,762 --> 00:09:28,359
Scott: Should we need a country to run away to and the other ones don't cut it?

173
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,925
Rym: Yeah, the thing is right now.

174
00:09:30,106 --> 00:09:32,255
Rym: top of that list is still Australia.

175
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:35,227
Rym: at this point in New Zealand They speak English there.

176
00:09:35,247 --> 00:09:35,790
Scott: That's a bonus.

177
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:36,092
Rym: Yep.

178
00:09:36,213 --> 00:09:40,227
Scott: It's super nice and warm Tropical coral reef, that's a bonus.

179
00:09:40,508 --> 00:09:41,934
Rym: Not more racist than the US.

180
00:09:41,954 --> 00:09:42,798
Scott: They have a pax.

181
00:09:42,838 --> 00:09:43,380
Scott: That's a bonus.

182
00:09:43,461 --> 00:09:44,213
Rym: They do have a pax.

183
00:09:44,294 --> 00:09:44,700
Rym: think about it.

184
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,475
Rym: We can flee and still be going to pax every year and suddenly going to Japan.

185
00:09:49,897 --> 00:09:50,800
Rym: not that big a deal.

186
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:57,006
Scott: You want to just go to Japan and let's have a weekend trip to the hot springs Same as a weekend trip to Florida.

187
00:09:57,187 --> 00:10:01,560
Rym: Yeah, so yeah, Australia's real high on my run away list, but Estonia surprisingly not.

188
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,979
Rym: I mean, it's cold there relative to other places.

189
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:09,667
Rym: Sure, I mean It's latitude wise.

190
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:11,295
Rym: it's like at the top of Scotland.

191
00:10:11,315 --> 00:10:17,159
Rym: So Yeah Why do all the nice places have to be in the shitty places?

192
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,177
Scott: Because the warm places while awesome and warm are full of like disease because also nasty poison.

193
00:10:23,197 --> 00:10:29,515
Rym: things live where it's warm Yeah, but also bad governments often Yes, which is not necessarily the fault of the places or the climate.

194
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:31,443
Rym: but pretty much, you know What who you can blame for this.

195
00:10:31,503 --> 00:10:33,449
Scott: banana British that them too.

196
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:36,157
Rym: Yeah, the British and bananas the bees.

197
00:10:36,598 --> 00:10:39,264
Scott: Yeah, blame the bees What kind of news you got?

198
00:10:39,284 --> 00:10:41,210
Rym: All right, so you die.

199
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:46,047
Rym: or how day if you're our company American You know, we ever.

200
00:10:46,308 --> 00:10:52,630
Rym: I don't want to get into like the all the side Societal stuff of self-driving cars, but I cannot stress this enough.

201
00:10:52,971 --> 00:10:56,580
Rym: This shit is moving way faster than you guys realize.

202
00:10:56,852 --> 00:10:58,352
Scott: Yeah It's like a lot of times.

203
00:10:58,393 --> 00:11:02,450
Scott: there's new fancy Technologies and some of them actually happen and some of them don't.

204
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,493
Rym: like Amazon drones like.

205
00:11:03,513 --> 00:11:05,680
Rym: yeah, they're moving fast, but they're not ready yet.

206
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,544
Scott: Yeah, you're not gonna see.

207
00:11:06,604 --> 00:11:13,073
Scott: it's like, you know, we saw we've seen flexible screens Right the kind you can roll around your finger for a long time.

208
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:20,020
Rym: I saw a laser projected keyboard That's virtual that you type on a desk with like ten years ago more like 20 years ago.

209
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:28,254
Scott: Yeah, I've seen the flexible screen since at least 10 15 20 years ago, but self-driving Yeah, but the self-driving car which we only saw a few years ago.

210
00:11:28,274 --> 00:11:29,760
Rym: They're already ready for primetime.

211
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:32,131
Rym: This is gonna happen like not even gonna happen.

212
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:32,794
Rym: It did happen.

213
00:11:32,814 --> 00:11:35,667
Scott: the existing technology Invest in self-driving car.

214
00:11:35,707 --> 00:11:38,920
Scott: if there's a company where I could afford the shares that wasn't Google might be Hyundai.

215
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:41,990
Scott: Well, they're not exactly a small company.

216
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:42,892
Rym: That's so.

217
00:11:42,973 --> 00:11:44,899
Rym: I don't know how much you know, I bet there's an ADR.

218
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,608
Rym: I'll look at Korean.

219
00:11:46,648 --> 00:11:48,238
Rym: That's yeah, you'd have to invest through an ADR.

220
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:51,287
Rym: That's how I bought all that Toyota stock.

221
00:11:51,488 --> 00:11:52,391
Scott: Yeah, it's pain in the ass.

222
00:11:52,492 --> 00:11:53,034
Rym: No, it's not.

223
00:11:53,134 --> 00:11:54,540
Rym: Scott trade just has ADRs.

224
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:55,765
Rym: Anyway, they're not special.

225
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:57,815
Rym: They act the same as the regular stock.

226
00:11:57,835 --> 00:11:58,739
Rym: You don't need to do anything.

227
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,246
Scott: continue.

228
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:10,939
Rym: so The technology as it literally exists today right now is Safer than humans at highway speeds and in sit like it's already better.

229
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,226
Rym: Mm-hmm.

230
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:20,340
Rym: If we never advance this technology further We would still be obligated from a moral standpoint to deploy it today because fewer people would die.

231
00:12:20,581 --> 00:12:22,350
Scott: Yes more at morally speaking.

232
00:12:22,471 --> 00:12:24,280
Scott: You should not be allowed to drive a car.

233
00:12:24,441 --> 00:12:27,100
Scott: A human being has no reason to ever drive a car in public.

234
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:32,320
Scott: Only unlike racetracks and other special events should be person be allowed to drive.

235
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,413
Scott: So otherwise you are simply risking death or risking murder.

236
00:12:36,493 --> 00:12:38,600
Rym: So laws and all these things are just like not catching up.

237
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,048
Rym: I mean look states are banning the sale of Tesla's.

238
00:12:41,349 --> 00:12:42,272
Rym: they're not self-driving.

239
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:43,236
Rym: They're just electric.

240
00:12:43,717 --> 00:12:54,008
Rym: Yeah, so Hyundai this year 2015 is selling a car that you can just buy that has Autopilot that you can just use.

241
00:12:54,028 --> 00:12:56,839
Scott: but the whole point is that if a car is autopilot, I don't have to buy it.

242
00:12:57,181 --> 00:13:02,040
Scott: The whole point is that there would just be cars around and I go outside and one does up to me and I get in.

243
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,685
Rym: Yeah, you say that's the difference.

244
00:13:03,886 --> 00:13:08,160
Rym: that requires a broader infrastructure and all these other changes.

245
00:13:08,702 --> 00:13:09,827
Scott: What changes does it need?

246
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,500
Rym: that technology isn't a hundred percent there yet?

247
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:17,835
Rym: Oh the technology of the car knows to come together pick up drop-off load balancing like there's stuff.

248
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,609
Rym: like there's a lot of infrastructure and Research still has to happen there.

249
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,224
Rym: forget the laws ignore laws Just technology.

250
00:13:23,605 --> 00:13:27,680
Rym: the the car picks me up drops me off to school and like I don't have to do anything is not there yet.

251
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:35,406
Rym: But what Hyundai is selling is you can be in this car this real car that will cost like 60k Like it's not that expensive for what it does.

252
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,172
Scott: That's more expensive than a BMW.

253
00:13:37,313 --> 00:13:42,622
Scott: Yeah, I mean there are BMWs more than that But they're also some less than here are the two features it'll have.

254
00:13:43,044 --> 00:13:58,723
Rym: if you're on a highway or freeway you turn on autopilot and You just let go the steering wheel and take your feet off the pedals and do whatever And it'll just drive All right, it'll follow the road a hundred percent it'll break it'll do speed It'll do everything.

255
00:13:59,124 --> 00:14:00,630
Scott: I would you know, I would get in it.

256
00:14:00,831 --> 00:14:03,280
Scott: I would let the you know, I'd have to see it first, right?

257
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,780
Scott: Yeah, I'd let the guy test right.

258
00:14:04,921 --> 00:14:05,643
Rym: You're not allowed to.

259
00:14:05,664 --> 00:14:06,085
Rym: here's the thing.

260
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:10,206
Rym: because of laws like you wouldn't be allowed to just like let crawl into the back and go To sleep.

261
00:14:10,348 --> 00:14:11,259
Scott: No, no, no, but I want it.

262
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,279
Scott: Like if I was gonna if they had these for sale in the US I would go there.

263
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,979
Scott: I'd let the dealer take it out.

264
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:19,872
Scott: Yeah You turn on the autopilot and he lets it go.

265
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,902
Scott: and if I see that when I'm sitting the passenger seat if I see that I'm not dead.

266
00:14:22,922 --> 00:14:24,167
Scott: Yep, then I'll do it.

267
00:14:24,328 --> 00:14:27,139
Rym: I would tell him to go with my phone live-streaming back to me.

268
00:14:27,828 --> 00:14:28,152
Scott: Oh sure.

269
00:14:28,213 --> 00:14:33,820
Rym: Good idea But the other thing it'll do is it has a traffic jam mode.

270
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:40,059
Rym: If you're in a traffic jam of any kind and a need to tell it or just do it You just be like traffic jam.

271
00:14:40,763 --> 00:14:41,447
Rym: Then what it'll do?

272
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:49,519
Rym: same thing let go and instead of highway stuff What it'll do is it'll just basically follow the car in front of it and deal with shit.

273
00:14:50,863 --> 00:14:57,580
Scott: But you got to keep your eye open for when the traffic jams about to end I'm pretty sure it'll be like traffic jam ending traffic jam ending or something.

274
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:03,898
Rym: So this is a real car that you'll be able to buy this year in only Korea cuz the crew.

275
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:05,574
Scott: no u.s All right.

276
00:15:07,682 --> 00:15:09,831
Scott: So yeah, you wanna buy one and split it.

277
00:15:09,851 --> 00:15:15,708
Rym: I kind of You can pay for the parking spot I mean, but here's the problem.

278
00:15:15,788 --> 00:15:18,120
Scott: I'll pay for the insurance for the price of this car.

279
00:15:18,782 --> 00:15:30,398
Rym: We could each buy a brand new Lotus Elis a and oh, yeah That's a shame but BMW is releasing something similar likely either this year or next year.

280
00:15:31,021 --> 00:15:35,375
Rym: Google seems to be the one powering both of these cars, but that's that's just rumors.

281
00:15:35,395 --> 00:15:35,897
Rym: I have money.

282
00:15:35,937 --> 00:15:36,840
Scott: I should buy a Lotus Elis.

283
00:15:37,445 --> 00:15:41,367
Scott: yeah, so I What am I gonna do in the winter?

284
00:15:41,849 --> 00:15:44,280
Rym: I can't die or not drive not drive.

285
00:15:44,703 --> 00:15:49,250
Rym: I cannot wait for this shit Like you do not understand.

286
00:15:49,612 --> 00:16:03,142
Rym: because imagine this world Even if it only does it on freeways like even if the technology was only that of only Freeway mode like it'll drive you to your exit and then get you off at the exit and you have to drive to and from the freeway.

287
00:16:03,725 --> 00:16:08,005
Rym: that turns every freeway in America into a Always running.

288
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:11,078
Rym: the train comes exactly when you want it to bullet train.

289
00:16:11,098 --> 00:16:14,391
Rym: Mm-hmm All you have to do is drive to the train station.

290
00:16:14,411 --> 00:16:15,234
Scott: Well, it's not a bullet train.

291
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:16,137
Scott: a bullet train goes 500 miles an hour.

292
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,970
Scott: Yeah, but this goes five times slower.

293
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:23,040
Rym: Yeah, so it'll be like a cell six times.

294
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:32,860
Rym: It'll be like in a cella that literally Every exit every entrance and exit ramp in the entire country is in a cella station and the Express trains go from the station.

295
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,249
Rym: You got on to the station you got off Except there's all this traffic.

296
00:16:36,753 --> 00:16:37,560
Scott: Yeah, but an accident.

297
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,054
Rym: Yeah, well, but the car is probably better with those accidents than I am.

298
00:16:41,476 --> 00:16:42,399
Scott: you might crash into you.

299
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:43,523
Rym: Yeah, the car.

300
00:16:43,543 --> 00:16:44,908
Rym: but the thing is they were gonna crash into you.

301
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:50,586
Rym: Anyway, sure plus I mean trains kill people Sure, not as many as cars.

302
00:16:50,686 --> 00:16:53,878
Scott: Yeah cars still way more people than skiing kill me kill more people than anything.

303
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,978
Rym: Yeah Actually, there's a scary side note.

304
00:16:58,261 --> 00:17:01,675
Rym: You know what kills more people in New York City than homicide right now?

305
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:07,133
Rym: Oh Drugs snow specifically just heroin overdoses.

306
00:17:07,173 --> 00:17:08,940
Scott: Well, that's the drug that's gonna kill you mostly.

307
00:17:09,181 --> 00:17:14,906
Rym: Yeah that that mean meth will kill you but in that long span of like you're dead Because of life choices.

308
00:17:14,926 --> 00:17:15,329
Rym: Well, it's cuz.

309
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:20,122
Scott: the heroin is too strong, you know Given the same heroin they used to now they're given the heroin It's like.

310
00:17:20,303 --> 00:17:20,664
Rym: what is that?

311
00:17:20,684 --> 00:17:21,608
Rym: Is that your political party?

312
00:17:21,647 --> 00:17:22,571
Rym: The rent is too damn high.

313
00:17:22,592 --> 00:17:24,520
Rym: The heroin is too damn strong, right?

314
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,960
Scott: They just dilute that shit then it wouldn't kill people so instantly.

315
00:17:28,643 --> 00:17:43,580
Rym: So one more little news because this is a rumor that like just came out LG apparently accidentally published a blog post early and then deleted it and It appears that Apple has an 8k resolution iMac for this year.

316
00:17:43,922 --> 00:17:45,133
Scott: This seems a bit ridiculous.

317
00:17:45,214 --> 00:17:49,123
Rym: like that is 7680 by 4320.

318
00:17:49,123 --> 00:17:50,871
Scott: it's hard to believe that this is real.

319
00:17:50,931 --> 00:18:00,805
Rym: if that monitor is not like 60 inches if it's not for monitors stuck together, I mean I'm kind of like the.

320
00:18:00,985 --> 00:18:02,470
Rym: this seems to be legit.

321
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,456
Rym: No people are talking about this like this.

322
00:18:04,556 --> 00:18:05,940
Rym: like this leak is legit.

323
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,965
Scott: so April Fool's late.

324
00:18:09,608 --> 00:18:10,129
Rym: I don't know.

325
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:11,554
Rym: Let's keep an eye on it.

326
00:18:11,614 --> 00:18:12,237
Rym: It's amazing.

327
00:18:12,277 --> 00:18:19,260
Rym: I think you may you pointed out We were talking about this before the show how even if this isn't true only Apple is doing this.

328
00:18:20,403 --> 00:18:33,480
Scott: Yeah, all the other companies usually I make fun of Apple because a thing that they do is they'll copy other people's technology Make it better obviously and then come out with it act like it's new like they invented it like iPhone.

329
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,591
Scott: It's like dude, we had palm trios like seven years ago.

330
00:18:36,912 --> 00:18:37,554
Scott: Where have you been?

331
00:18:37,795 --> 00:18:38,959
Scott: Oh, but this one doesn't suck.

332
00:18:39,381 --> 00:18:43,052
Scott: Tablets view Sonic and Microsoft are making tablets like five six years.

333
00:18:43,112 --> 00:18:43,714
Scott: Where have you been?

334
00:18:44,115 --> 00:18:45,820
Scott: Oh yours doesn't suck, right?

335
00:18:46,182 --> 00:18:48,996
Scott: Oh, we had virtual desktops on Linux and Unix and like the 80s.

336
00:18:49,037 --> 00:18:49,640
Scott: What are you doing?

337
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,889
Scott: Yeah, actually spaces are actually like really much.

338
00:18:53,391 --> 00:19:01,138
Rym: panels came out and suddenly like everyone's got this like 1080p monitor and I'm like what the fuck I had 1600 by whatever on my CRT.

339
00:19:01,178 --> 00:19:04,251
Scott: Yeah Everyone has touch pads on their laptops.

340
00:19:04,452 --> 00:19:06,018
Scott: Oh this Apple one doesn't suck.

341
00:19:06,098 --> 00:19:13,820
Scott: Yeah So, you know people had 4k displays, but it's like Apple pretty much has run away with it.

342
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,268
Scott: They're dominating it.

343
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:19,643
Scott: they came out with the retina before everyone else and They're better than everyone else.

344
00:19:19,683 --> 00:19:27,507
Scott: Yeah, they are and if this is true, they're not even like letting like Windows still can't really do 4k Yeah, and they're all apples like.

345
00:19:27,527 --> 00:19:29,796
Scott: oh, well while we're ahead of you, let's run to 8k.

346
00:19:30,097 --> 00:19:30,338
Scott: Uh-huh.

347
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:30,740
Scott: You suck.

348
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,208
Scott: Yeah, the thing is the hardware can do it.

349
00:19:33,428 --> 00:19:35,115
Scott: the video cards have DisplayPort.

350
00:19:35,436 --> 00:19:36,139
Scott: they can push it.

351
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,020
Rym: I mean, you know what it's like.

352
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,553
Rym: It's like an advanced wars or like a max are mad weak compared to Windows.

353
00:19:40,774 --> 00:19:42,460
Scott: most Windows PCs that are any good.

354
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:46,131
Scott: Why doesn't someone make these fucking monitors standalone?

355
00:19:46,211 --> 00:19:48,759
Scott: Dell your 4k monitors are garbage.

356
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:51,033
Rym: Yeah Well, there's a lot of things that have to change like sample.

357
00:19:51,154 --> 00:19:52,943
Scott: Yeah Windows software Why don't you update?

358
00:19:53,163 --> 00:19:58,280
Rym: Apple can get away with a lot because the monitor is basically baked in with the computer.

359
00:19:58,467 --> 00:20:01,992
Rym: Yes I mean DVI can't push that DVI can't even push 4k.

360
00:20:02,052 --> 00:20:04,964
Rym: the new DVI can the new DVI But you need.

361
00:20:05,226 --> 00:20:07,240
Rym: you need the full like double cable, too.

362
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:13,020
Scott: No, you don't need the double cable with your DVI if you use the main DisplayPort this yeah DisplayPort DisplayPort.

363
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,987
Rym: Yeah, I was talking like DVI DVI.

364
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,674
Scott: No, no, but DisplayPort.

365
00:20:16,694 --> 00:20:23,187
Scott: if you've old DisplayPort 1.0 I guess I think is the old version the one you're using now, you know I lost track you would need.

366
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:29,620
Scott: you would need two cables or 4k But if you had the new version DisplayPort 2.0 or whatever version number it frickin is.

367
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:33,120
Scott: Then you could use one DisplayPort cable for a 4k monitor.

368
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,565
Rym: You know why I lost track of all that.

369
00:20:34,565 --> 00:20:37,956
Rym: 1920 by 1200 is basically the best you're gonna do in Windows.

370
00:20:38,518 --> 00:20:39,180
Scott: pretty much.

371
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:44,917
Scott: I mean you could get a 2560 monitor, but it's gonna be either a really big monitor or not.

372
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,503
Scott: So it's.

373
00:20:46,603 --> 00:20:47,267
Scott: it's not about the.

374
00:20:47,388 --> 00:20:49,580
Scott: it's like Windows can do the high resolutions.

375
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,936
Scott: It's just it only does them for a big monitor if you have a small monitor with a high resolution.

376
00:20:54,976 --> 00:20:58,327
Scott: with the increased pixel density Some things scale some things don't.

377
00:20:58,428 --> 00:21:01,238
Scott: you can't see anything because everything is so goddamn small.

378
00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:03,886
Scott: Yep That's why like you'll get 2560.

379
00:21:03,886 --> 00:21:12,623
Scott: I'm like a 27 inch is fine, but Apple's doing like that on 19 inch level Everything's you get like.

380
00:21:12,643 --> 00:21:14,830
Scott: can I even read this text zoom zoom zoom.

381
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,160
Rym: so 8k approaches the resolution of that thing in wool.

382
00:21:19,704 --> 00:21:23,856
Rym: Yeah, yeah Kinda.

383
00:21:23,877 --> 00:21:26,239
Rym: so We'll see what the deal is with this.

384
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:33,422
Rym: But if it really is this year, I think that the moral of this year and last year has been wait for September 2015.

385
00:21:33,422 --> 00:21:36,781
Rym: Yeah, everything is happening in September 2015.

386
00:21:36,781 --> 00:21:38,507
Scott: Apple 6 iPhone 6s.

387
00:21:38,989 --> 00:21:39,330
Rym: Yep.

388
00:21:39,752 --> 00:21:51,100
Rym: Oh my god, if there is a smaller iPhone I like you cannot understand how fast my Nexus 4 will just fall out of my pocket as I'm running toward an Apple store.

389
00:21:51,261 --> 00:21:54,338
Scott: I think the rumor is they're gonna make one that's the same as the iPhone 5 size.

390
00:21:54,981 --> 00:22:02,001
Rym: I could deal with that at this point because remember the phone I was thinking about getting was the Sony Xperia z3 Compact.

391
00:22:02,442 --> 00:22:05,491
Rym: the compact is about the same size as my Nexus 4.

392
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,597
Rym: Mmm knock it like I've rivaled.

393
00:22:07,718 --> 00:22:08,380
Rym: I've given up.

394
00:22:08,801 --> 00:22:11,331
Rym: This is the smallest you're gonna get for a long time.

395
00:22:11,351 --> 00:22:13,821
Scott: I'm gonna get the iPhone 7 mini in 2016.

396
00:22:13,821 --> 00:22:14,864
Rym: Yeah, cuz that's gonna happen.

397
00:22:14,964 --> 00:22:15,666
Scott: iPhone nano.

398
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:19,278
Rym: what I'm gonna get in September is whatever iPad air they announced.

399
00:22:19,318 --> 00:22:21,959
Scott: probably The big iPad is too big.

400
00:22:22,701 --> 00:22:23,840
Rym: Yeah, well, I don't know.

401
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:28,120
Scott: I'm just gonna get a bigger iPad mini because the one I have run out of space even though it's perfectly fine.

402
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,188
Rym: But he already though.

403
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:29,954
Rym: Here's the problem.

404
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:49,243
Rym: I Use my laptop primarily to do the kinds of things that are hard to do on a tablet But when I'm on an airplane I use my laptop primarily to do the things that I should be doing on a tablet once Almost never use the laptop Almost never.

405
00:22:49,323 --> 00:22:49,825
Rym: Yeah, I do.

406
00:22:49,846 --> 00:22:52,898
Rym: You know, I do a lot of typing words when I'm away.

407
00:22:52,918 --> 00:22:58,096
Rym: Yeah I don't type that many words at once But then you and Emily does she just carries around like a little Bluetooth keyboard.

408
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:58,880
Scott: You can also do that.

409
00:22:58,941 --> 00:23:00,900
Rym: Yeah, so it's pretty much September.

410
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,529
Rym: I'm either getting a surface pro or an iPad.

411
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:07,020
Scott: the regular surface 3 the non Pro surface 3 is coming.

412
00:23:07,422 --> 00:23:08,245
Rym: Yeah, I can wait.

413
00:23:08,647 --> 00:23:11,540
Scott: No, I mean no one wants it, but the surface Pro is just better.

414
00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:16,086
Scott: Yeah, but if you want to save a lot of money, they got rid of that Windows RT bullshit I think.

415
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:17,340
Scott: I think it's real windows now.

416
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,240
Scott: So like you don't need the power of the surface Pro.

417
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,520
Scott: I guess we're gonna have to wait for reviews to come out.

418
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:34,154
Scott: But the real the regular non Pro surface 3 might not be garbage might might I mean honestly or might be garbage Surface pros and services in general.

419
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:39,460
Rym: They're the only Portable non just a tablet like a not real computer.

420
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:47,498
Rym: I've seen in a long time that has the basically universal praise that used to be reserved for like Lenovo ThinkPad type things.

421
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,180
Rym: anyway things of the day.

422
00:23:58,621 --> 00:24:01,971
Rym: This person has a bunny like we have bunnies like Neil deGrasse.

423
00:24:01,991 --> 00:24:09,160
Rym: Tyson has bunnies and he made the Game of Thrones throne out of carrots.

424
00:24:09,842 --> 00:24:14,877
Rym: Okay for the bunny and the bunny ate it and the bunny is just like oh my gosh.

425
00:24:15,217 --> 00:24:16,060
Rym: and just sits there eating it.

426
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,584
Rym: It's really fun.

427
00:24:16,604 --> 00:24:17,309
Scott: It's a lot of carrot.

428
00:24:17,349 --> 00:24:18,840
Scott: Isn't the bunny gonna get full and sick?

429
00:24:19,242 --> 00:24:26,432
Rym: Well, it looks like he made it out of a lot of carrot shavings down here Mmm, I also attach it to cardboard which the bunny likes to eat.

430
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:27,797
Rym: Yeah, but they don't eat it.

431
00:24:27,837 --> 00:24:30,290
Rym: They bite it Mmm, so I just thought this is cute.

432
00:24:30,873 --> 00:24:31,075
Rym: Also.

433
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,000
Rym: I had a better thing in the day.

434
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:35,800
Rym: There was this amazing world star fight, but it disappeared from YouTube, but I didn't have time to find it again.

435
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,720
Scott: I'm sure it's on world star.

436
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:40,516
Rym: I will find it and it'll be my thing of the day in the future because there's some special.

437
00:24:40,556 --> 00:24:42,944
Scott: pretty sure you just go to World star and click random that.

438
00:24:42,984 --> 00:24:48,520
Rym: yeah, but this fight what the way I would describe it was a combinatorial explosion of fighting.

439
00:24:49,541 --> 00:25:00,220
Rym: It was like this one guy starts fighting with this other guy and there's people watching and then someone starts going like world star World star and this other guy's like man shut up and it starts fighting with the guy who's yelling world star.

440
00:25:00,643 --> 00:25:02,012
Scott: Okay, never shouting world star.

441
00:25:02,193 --> 00:25:07,156
Scott: Yeah And it escalates from there as if yesterday I had seen a fight.

442
00:25:07,237 --> 00:25:13,593
Rym: I may have yelled But the funny the guy yelling world star was videoing it and then he got attacked.

443
00:25:13,834 --> 00:25:16,001
Rym: and the videos from someone else who was videoing It.

444
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:19,100
Rym: and by the end of the video the video ends with that guy getting attacked.

445
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:22,410
Rym: But I couldn't show that to you because it disappeared.

446
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:25,420
Rym: so behold the iron throne out of carrots for me.

447
00:25:25,761 --> 00:25:26,704
Rym: I love how the video is called.

448
00:25:26,865 --> 00:25:29,112
Rym: built the iron throne out of carrots for my rabbit.

449
00:25:30,015 --> 00:25:31,300
Rym: I like titles of things like that.

450
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,683
Scott: Well Rym.

451
00:25:33,703 --> 00:25:45,086
Scott: Yeah, you're gonna call when there's something strange in your bed my bed in your bed He drinks the piss an invisible man In your bed, I can't believe.

452
00:25:45,146 --> 00:25:46,069
Rym: Scott showed this to me.

453
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,835
Rym: creepy ghost bed the whole time.

454
00:25:47,896 --> 00:25:48,478
Rym: I'm watching it.

455
00:25:48,538 --> 00:25:48,859
Rym: I'm like man.

456
00:25:49,801 --> 00:25:51,808
Rym: Yeah, tub thumping like Neil Cicierega's thing.

457
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:54,016
Rym: This is just like that Neil Cicierega thing.

458
00:25:54,358 --> 00:25:55,846
Rym: Oh my god I had no idea.

459
00:25:55,947 --> 00:25:57,579
Rym: was actually just yeah, Neil Cicierega made this.

460
00:25:58,062 --> 00:26:02,640
Scott: I thought like he Rym was saying like this is just like this Neil Cicierega's other thing.

461
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:06,439
Scott: I thought you had seen what YouTube channel it was and thus knew that he made it

462
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:15,748
Rym: But I did not cuz I clicked on the link and just maximized immediately and started playing and I wasn't sure what this was gonna be Until I learned about the man live sleeping in my bed.

463
00:26:15,828 --> 00:26:18,576
Scott: Well, this is busting goes bed busting.

464
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:23,574
Rym: this Has already replaced the original Ghostbusters theme in my head.

465
00:26:23,594 --> 00:26:25,657
Rym: I Can't it is.

466
00:26:28,523 --> 00:26:30,774
Rym: This is in fact the original Ghostbusters theme.

467
00:26:30,814 --> 00:26:35,580
Rym: now sure In the meta moment the book club book is still water ship down.

468
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:44,039
Rym: It is a story about rabbits and while it has much allegory that can be right into it The author himself has said that is just a story about rabbits trying to find a new home.

469
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:46,912
Rym: as We talked about an anime Boston in our panel.

470
00:26:46,932 --> 00:26:51,169
Rym: Mm-hmm Our next convention is Connecticut, which is in July.

471
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,253
Rym: so we had a long.

472
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:54,660
Scott: as much as that seems like it's a long way away.

473
00:26:55,082 --> 00:26:56,572
Scott: It's like 13 weeks away.

474
00:26:56,592 --> 00:27:02,720
Scott: Yeah This weekend in New York City is the mocha festival mocha fest.

475
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,680
Rym: We'll be there one of the days with a bunch of friends doing our things in a new location.

476
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:07,765
Scott: Don't go to the armory.

477
00:27:07,805 --> 00:27:08,829
Scott: You will be lonely there.

478
00:27:08,849 --> 00:27:11,400
Scott: Yeah, you maybe get shot there because it's an armory.

479
00:27:12,324 --> 00:27:13,088
Scott: I don't know if that'll happen.

480
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,240
Scott: But yeah, don't go to the wrong place.

481
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,246
Scott: It's in a new place.

482
00:27:16,287 --> 00:27:18,160
Scott: check their website to figure out where that place is.

483
00:27:18,221 --> 00:27:22,390
Scott: I think it's in Chelsea or some shit If you wanted to present at Connecticut.

484
00:27:22,751 --> 00:27:25,059
Rym: the submission deadline ended like a week ago guys.

485
00:27:25,842 --> 00:27:29,780
Rym: So the form is still open and you can still submit.

486
00:27:30,261 --> 00:27:34,193
Rym: However, I am just scheduling stuff on a daily basis.

487
00:27:34,233 --> 00:27:36,420
Scott: right now you get negative points for being late.

488
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:41,091
Rym: Yeah, so submit your shit guys Connecticut is a rockin con.

489
00:27:41,713 --> 00:27:48,927
Rym: if you've just joined us from anime Boston and somehow you Listened all the way to this point Every night of GeekNights is different.

490
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,131
Rym: So this is the Monday night.

491
00:27:50,231 --> 00:27:52,840
Rym: So it's technology and neck beards and Linux and stuff.

492
00:27:53,721 --> 00:27:58,060
Rym: So you probably want the Wednesday GeekNights, which is actually anime and manga and comics and all that stuff.

493
00:27:58,161 --> 00:28:00,779
Scott: Or maybe you're an awesome person who appreciates more than one thing in life.

494
00:28:01,061 --> 00:28:02,506
Scott: Yeah, you should listen to all four nights.

495
00:28:02,707 --> 00:28:09,699
Rym: But if you go to our website for recruit comm I did post the list of all The anime we showed and talked about in that short form anime panel.

496
00:28:11,503 --> 00:28:14,780
Scott: We have a presence on the internet in every place that is on the internet.

497
00:28:15,263 --> 00:28:26,336
Scott: So you should go to your favorite, you know Facebook's Twitter's our website any place that there is things and Connect with us in a connecting way.

498
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:30,510
Rym: Yes And also if you did not yet, press the button.

499
00:28:30,551 --> 00:28:32,376
Rym: do not fucking press the button.

500
00:28:32,857 --> 00:28:35,565
Rym: wait for it guys Jesus maybe it happened already.

501
00:28:35,745 --> 00:28:36,287
Rym: No, it did not.

502
00:28:36,367 --> 00:28:37,872
Rym: No, it didn't know Scott.

503
00:28:38,493 --> 00:28:39,817
Rym: I'm invested in this button.

504
00:28:39,897 --> 00:28:40,780
Rym: The button's fine.

505
00:28:41,102 --> 00:28:41,926
Scott: I stopped paying attention.

506
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:46,506
Rym: Yeah, I wonder why you stopped paying attention Filthy 60.

507
00:28:46,506 --> 00:28:48,375
Rym: I can't believe you pushed the button.

508
00:28:48,475 --> 00:28:49,360
Scott: I didn't know what was going on.

509
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:49,983
Scott: I just saw.

510
00:28:50,084 --> 00:28:51,231
Scott: I just went to the website.

511
00:28:51,352 --> 00:28:52,640
Rym: you had one shot.

512
00:28:52,781 --> 00:28:55,033
Scott: I saw that there was a button so I pressed it.

513
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:56,180
Rym: you had one shot.

514
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,266
Scott: I looked up what the button did.

515
00:28:57,346 --> 00:28:59,035
Scott: afterwards cuz I'm like, wow, I press that button.

516
00:28:59,075 --> 00:28:59,537
Scott: Nothing happened.

517
00:28:59,557 --> 00:28:59,980
Scott: What the fuck?

518
00:29:00,482 --> 00:29:09,237
Rym: I hope against hope that when that's countdown timer hits zero All that happens is that entire subreddit is deleted forever immediately.

519
00:29:09,337 --> 00:29:09,678
Rym: And that's it.

520
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:10,260
Rym: Nothing else.

521
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:11,688
Rym: No word is ever said again.

522
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:17,936
Rym: Okay, that would be the best possible ending But my goal is to be one of the last human beings to press that button.

523
00:29:18,338 --> 00:29:18,558
Rym: Okay?

524
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,929
Rym: So yeah FPGAs which I guess we've never talked about on GeekNights.

525
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:29,532
Scott: So FPGA is like a weird thing that only ridiculously Technological people even know exist or care about.

526
00:29:29,552 --> 00:29:32,972
Rym: so Scott I learned about like at RIT We had a class on the history of computing.

527
00:29:33,012 --> 00:29:34,220
Rym: We talked about this shit a lot.

528
00:29:34,863 --> 00:29:36,352
Scott: I just I fully like.

529
00:29:36,372 --> 00:29:45,273
Scott: I knew sort of what they were But I didn't fully learn about them until I was on a co-op that There was what they had them and I learned really super more what they were.

530
00:29:45,554 --> 00:29:49,024
Rym: so I knew about them because I worked at IBM When they were.

531
00:29:49,306 --> 00:29:56,815
Rym: when like I was I literally worked in the factory Like support like all the machines like the computers on the factory floor that like did shit.

532
00:29:57,377 --> 00:29:58,100
Rym: that was my job.

533
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:05,636
Rym: It was the factor that made the cell processor Which is in this class of this type of computing.

534
00:30:05,736 --> 00:30:07,242
Scott: It's not an FPGA No, it's not.

535
00:30:07,503 --> 00:30:10,737
Rym: but a lot of the things I wanted like kudos aren't really FPGAs either.

536
00:30:10,757 --> 00:30:18,000
Rym: They're not even close Yeah, but they serve the same purpose Really for my industry and for most people that I mean.

537
00:30:18,341 --> 00:30:25,064
Scott: So we see your problem is you're thinking about an FPGA from the perspective of I have a job I want to get done.

538
00:30:25,285 --> 00:30:29,378
Scott: Yeah, and these are different things that do the job But that's not you know.

539
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:34,981
Scott: And some of them might be FPGAs and some of them might be not but that's not what makes an FPGA special.

540
00:30:35,202 --> 00:30:42,465
Scott: the thing that makes an FPGA special is the fact that what it is and how it works is crazy regardless of whether if It's actually useful or not.

541
00:30:42,726 --> 00:30:44,713
Rym: and it's something that you'll think this is crazy.

542
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,720
Rym: It's existed for a long time.

543
00:30:46,801 --> 00:30:48,150
Scott: It's existed for a long time.

544
00:30:48,191 --> 00:30:49,440
Scott: So let me explain to you now.

545
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:56,660
Scott: Alright, so FPGA stands for field programmable gate array, which is complete gibberish, but it sounds kind of awesome.

546
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:00,533
Rym: It is a gate array that you can program in the field, right?

547
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,360
Scott: So think about this.

548
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,384
Scott: I buy a microchip.

549
00:31:03,846 --> 00:31:05,152
Scott: this microchip is way simple.

550
00:31:05,192 --> 00:31:06,820
Scott: It's like four and gates lined up.

551
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,560
Rym: It's I had a bunch of those as a kid, right?

552
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,853
Scott: It's like on the left side there's eight pins and on the right side is four pins.

553
00:31:11,873 --> 00:31:13,420
Scott: It's just four and gates all together.

554
00:31:14,184 --> 00:31:16,113
Scott: All right, it's four and gates all together.

555
00:31:16,133 --> 00:31:17,866
Scott: I can't change it It's.

556
00:31:18,029 --> 00:31:18,739
Scott: it is what it is.

557
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:27,327
Scott: And if I want to make a circuit board I need to get more chips and connect them together on the circuit board and do all kinds of stuff Right with wires in between these chips.

558
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:33,485
Scott: if I want say a processor like a CPU I buy a CPU.

559
00:31:33,585 --> 00:31:38,300
Scott: maybe I buy an 8086 CPU or I buy I don't know a core 2 duo.

560
00:31:38,581 --> 00:31:44,690
Rym: So that thing has a fucking million million million million of these gates on it Sure, but it's still.

561
00:31:44,831 --> 00:31:46,320
Scott: it is what it is, right?

562
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:52,080
Scott: I see an Intel CPU takes in Intel assembly instructions executes them and outputs what it's supposed to output.

563
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:53,383
Scott: That's what it does.

564
00:31:53,423 --> 00:31:56,110
Scott: It does one thing and you can program it.

565
00:31:56,572 --> 00:32:04,602
Scott: it can execute programs that are arbitrary in general But it can only do that one thing it is a one job chip.

566
00:32:05,044 --> 00:32:13,260
Rym: now at the same time that job is generic because a stand like an x86 chip is Designed to be a generic processor.

567
00:32:13,802 --> 00:32:21,848
Rym: you can write code in C or C++ or Python or whatever and Just it'll compile and work on that chip.

568
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:25,580
Rym: If you throw a thread at a core on that chip, it'll execute.

569
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:29,233
Rym: Yep, don't have to worry like what kind of chip it is.

570
00:32:29,253 --> 00:32:31,220
Scott: So an FPGA is crazy.

571
00:32:31,642 --> 00:32:34,513
Scott: It's a chip right with a ton of freaking gates.

572
00:32:34,814 --> 00:32:36,300
Scott: Well, they're not really gates.

573
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:45,418
Scott: They're basically logic blocks Right and each logic block can be configured right to be sort of any kind of gate or even fancier than a gate in many cases.

574
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:50,295
Scott: And all of these blocks are all connected to each other by a whole bunch of.

575
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:54,350
Scott: we'll call them highways Simply because that's a good metaphor for it.

576
00:32:55,054 --> 00:33:02,273
Scott: So it's like imagine if Every house on the street could perform one logical operation and you could change.

577
00:33:02,754 --> 00:33:16,769
Scott: any house could do any one logical operation and you could connect the houses in any fucking way you wanted and every and you could keep rearranging them willy-nilly all day long and You could basically make any chip out of this chip.

578
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,156
Scott: So the idea is a shape-shifting chip.

579
00:33:19,217 --> 00:33:20,200
Scott: It can take any form.

580
00:33:20,621 --> 00:33:21,364
Rym: Yeah, so think about this.

581
00:33:21,404 --> 00:33:24,215
Rym: if you want if you have an NES it's got its hardware.

582
00:33:24,356 --> 00:33:24,637
Scott: It has.

583
00:33:24,657 --> 00:33:25,440
Scott: yeah, there's some chip.

584
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,215
Scott: That's the NES CPU and all it can be is an NES.

585
00:33:29,235 --> 00:33:38,431
Scott: if you have an FPGA You could actually if you had an FPGA big enough you could program the FPGA to become The same chip that is in the NES.

586
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:40,420
Scott: as long as it digital it can't do any analog business.

587
00:33:40,842 --> 00:33:41,646
Rym: So think about that.

588
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:50,100
Rym: if you normally if you want to run like an NES on your computer You emulate it in software on top of a general-purpose CPU and that works very well.

589
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,521
Scott: There's not.

590
00:33:50,581 --> 00:33:51,585
Rym: if there's a lot of overhead like.

591
00:33:51,605 --> 00:33:54,816
Rym: there's a reason why modern consoles are not emulatable easily.

592
00:33:55,037 --> 00:33:55,840
Scott: Yes, that is true.

593
00:33:56,663 --> 00:33:59,195
Rym: I mean a lot of older consoles aren't even emulatable very easily.

594
00:33:59,215 --> 00:34:00,059
Scott: you could write.

595
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:05,000
Scott: So basically an FPGA works is that when it is no power, it's blank.

596
00:34:05,441 --> 00:34:08,893
Scott: It's super blank and if the power ever goes out it erases.

597
00:34:09,074 --> 00:34:14,620
Scott: so fuck you don't let the power go out And when it turns on it actually takes a while to boot.

598
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,547
Scott: It's not a quick booting thing.

599
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:27,129
Scott: like you if you made a device based on FPGAs Every time you turned it on unless you had some infinite battery life keeping that FPGA going you would have to wait a little bit for it to get started.

600
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:33,510
Scott: and What happens is this one part of the day FPGA that looks for some flash memory external flash memory.

601
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:37,543
Scott: Some of them now have internal flash memory, but usually external flash memory.

602
00:34:38,045 --> 00:34:39,710
Scott: You wouldn't use something slower than flash memory.

603
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:40,458
Scott: that'd be a bad idea.

604
00:34:41,388 --> 00:34:57,110
Scott: and It looks in that flash memory for a program written in Basically like some sort of HDL or VHDL language Which is not like any programming language you're used to because it's not a series of instructions saying do this then do this then do This.

605
00:34:57,572 --> 00:35:18,069
Scott: it's a series of instructions saying you're a chip become this shape and then once the FPGA is done loading it becomes the shape that was described by the Program in the hardware definition language in the flash memory and as long as it is powered on it retains that shape.

606
00:35:18,995 --> 00:35:27,716
Rym: So in practical terms because I you know I'm not a developer so I come at this from this very like the other standard of like like this the view of What would you use this for?

607
00:35:27,757 --> 00:35:29,986
Rym: there are really only two uses for FPGAs.

608
00:35:30,107 --> 00:35:30,830
Scott: There are quite a few.

609
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:34,673
Rym: Well, the core I'm talking like at the highest highest level Rapid prototyping.

610
00:35:34,854 --> 00:35:39,170
Rym: Yes of something that eventually you expect to print a real chip, right?

611
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,764
Scott: So like let's say you're developing.

612
00:35:40,946 --> 00:35:48,483
Scott: I don't know battery controller like a special Some sort of small microprocessor, but it's specialized.

613
00:35:48,504 --> 00:35:52,969
Scott: You don't want to use a generic general-purpose Microprocessor even though that's probably a really good idea.

614
00:35:53,050 --> 00:36:00,670
Rym: Yeah well you want to make a special chip just For your hardware product like imagine a heart like you need a hard real-time system for something.

615
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:03,170
Scott: They're very specialized sure, but you're still working on it.

616
00:36:03,531 --> 00:36:15,210
Scott: So you just have an FPGA and you keep reprogramming it all the time until it's just right And then once you have the FPGA programmed properly you say alright, let's make a chip exactly identical to this.

617
00:36:15,892 --> 00:36:19,266
Scott: You know the way I shaped this FPGA.

618
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:20,390
Scott: and then you make a real chip.

619
00:36:20,871 --> 00:36:37,155
Scott: You can even do crazy stuff these days like design chips like in your chip layout program like draw Transistors and and gates and everything all lined up and then actually have that converted into the HDL to send to an FPGA which is crazy.

620
00:36:37,336 --> 00:37:11,199
Rym: the other application is if you have a use of Computers that requires such low latency and such hard determinism or real-timeness as in like real-time OS that the very specific and technical term and if you're in one of those cases like The best example I could come up with is financials because that's where a lot pretty much all this stuff gets used in the real world is say you want to have a computer that's looking at the market looking at market data and Sending orders to react to that market data.

621
00:37:11,901 --> 00:37:22,105
Rym: if you have an algorithm that requires an extreme extreme low latency you would want a chip that Physically takes the market data and turns it into orders.

622
00:37:22,346 --> 00:37:22,526
Scott: Yep.

623
00:37:22,948 --> 00:37:23,390
Scott: You could do that.

624
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:38,590
Rym: Yep, and that is the kind of thing that people use these for ultra ultra high-performance highly specialized things or rapid prototyping or just QA testing of a special purpose device Nothing FPHC even if you need ridiculous low latency.

625
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:43,425
Scott: Right, you could just get like a modern CPU like the craziest one.

626
00:37:43,445 --> 00:37:44,970
Scott: You could buy some Xeon nonsense.

627
00:37:45,512 --> 00:37:49,608
Scott: You say that and write a program in assembly and get it to do the thing.

628
00:37:49,628 --> 00:37:51,355
Rym: now We found that there's this.

629
00:37:51,455 --> 00:38:04,077
Rym: there's this barrier on be under around 10 microseconds where soft real-time systems like software running on an x86 chip you just cannot Have.

630
00:38:04,298 --> 00:38:07,694
Scott: you can also do non x86 but with the Anything.

631
00:38:07,734 --> 00:38:10,650
Scott: but the FPGA is especially good at that.

632
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:14,550
Scott: The regular CPU is not especially good at is being parallel.

633
00:38:14,811 --> 00:38:24,110
Scott: You see if you buy some even the best Intel chip was like an 8 core or 4 cores faking 8 cores or whatever Like some 30 like upper cores, right?

634
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:40,751
Scott: Sure If you get an FPGA if it has enough gates in it if that is enough logic blocks in it usually FPGAs the especially the big ones have way more input output pins than any CPU is gonna have and have way more freaking gates total because you're gonna need Them.

635
00:38:41,314 --> 00:39:05,269
Scott: but if you're doing something that doesn't take up the whole FPGA you can sort of take that hardware definition language and just copy paste like five or six times in a row or maybe a hundred times or maybe a thousand times and that one FPGA will actually be 1,000 or a hundred or a whole bunch of the chip that you need stacked up.

636
00:39:05,731 --> 00:39:11,558
Scott: so and now each one of those is Independent of the other ones.

637
00:39:11,578 --> 00:39:14,109
Scott: I have the whole working in perfect parallel.

638
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:24,570
Rym: I have this image that I'm looking at this from a presentation on FPGAs and Intel stuff and everything and basically like a dedicated Pro like a regular Xeon as you throw threads at it you get more and more performance.

639
00:39:24,711 --> 00:39:34,810
Rym: But until Scott said there's only so many cores you can put in one of those things And once you hit that peak of threads, there is literally like you can't do more, right?

640
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:41,112
Scott: even if you're doing some simple job like adding one and one you want to basically add one and one as many times as You can.

641
00:39:41,172 --> 00:39:48,767
Scott: well even the best CPU you can buy a new egg can only Simultaneously add one and one so many times at once.

642
00:39:48,827 --> 00:39:56,277
Scott: at some point It's going to have to wait for one of the one plus ones to finish adding up to two Before it starts doing another one.

643
00:39:56,558 --> 00:40:00,050
Scott: with an FPGA an adder doesn't take up many logic blocks.

644
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,416
Scott: It probably takes up one of them, right?

645
00:40:02,476 --> 00:40:04,161
Scott: It's a really simple operation.

646
00:40:04,482 --> 00:40:09,559
Scott: So if you have an FPGA with like a Thousand friggin logic blocks in it.

647
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:20,496
Scott: Each one of them can add one and one simultaneously and As long as you have enough output pins, you can output twos on all of them simultaneously.

648
00:40:20,557 --> 00:40:31,409
Scott: so this is a hundred percent Simultaneously not like there would be no waiting whatsoever for the next two ones to come in For the next twos to go out.

649
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,938
Rym: So this is where this is why I brought up the cell processor.

650
00:40:33,978 --> 00:40:39,893
Rym: because the actual real-world use for this that massive like that massively parallel Processing.

651
00:40:40,655 --> 00:40:51,890
Rym: the problem with using FPGAs to do that is that you can't just write like your code like oh Yeah I'll use like 800 threads or a thousand threads or whatever and just compile it and have it work on an FPGA.

652
00:40:52,792 --> 00:41:00,410
Rym: there is a layer between That code that logic and the FPGA and that layer is a developer who will charge you millions of dollars.

653
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,998
Scott: Yes, here's the problems with FPGAs.

654
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:04,383
Scott: I mean, it seems like a miracle right?

655
00:41:04,443 --> 00:41:06,530
Scott: Why wouldn't every chip just be an FPGA?

656
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:08,826
Scott: I mean throw out my core to whatever it is.

657
00:41:09,731 --> 00:41:14,184
Scott: Or i7 put an FPGA in my computer and then I can just upgrade it.

658
00:41:14,565 --> 00:41:18,680
Scott: if they come out with a better CPU design I'll just download it upgrade my FPGA.

659
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,990
Scott: It doesn't matter that it erases when the computer turns on.

660
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:29,556
Scott: I can just up I can flash that bit of flash memory with a new CPU design and I'll never have to upgrade my FPGA or anything.

661
00:41:29,657 --> 00:41:41,064
Rym: that's great until one anything ever changes yeah, and then you have to rewrite all your code probably yeah or two if You make any mistakes writing your code.

662
00:41:41,286 --> 00:41:44,295
Scott: Yeah, so at all FPGA problem number one.

663
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:47,146
Scott: It is ridiculously difficult to program you to be a genius.

664
00:41:47,287 --> 00:41:47,990
Scott: I can't do it.

665
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:53,547
Rym: I know a few people who will do write code for it like like not like we do.

666
00:41:53,607 --> 00:41:58,687
Scott: I can do the tutorial Simple like yeah make the FPGA do math, but I can't like.

667
00:41:58,888 --> 00:41:59,370
Rym: see I look one.

668
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:03,109
Rym: I'm like you're looking at the level of like FPGA like at its core, right?

669
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:10,495
Scott: But that's like the level you have to discuss it as because and the real world modern FPGAs are insane And they're all completely different.

670
00:42:10,515 --> 00:42:12,021
Scott: They have memory now.

671
00:42:12,342 --> 00:42:14,269
Scott: They have like analog things in them.

672
00:42:14,289 --> 00:42:16,810
Scott: now They got all sorts of crazy shit in them.

673
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:29,610
Rym: You'll get like a PCI X card that just has these things on it and you'll get this SDK and these Documentation that will basically tell you to code in a way that you have never coded before genius to read it and understand it.

674
00:42:29,791 --> 00:42:43,650
Rym: It's a lot like in Java like people were like zero GC Java code Because that makes Java like as deterministic as non Java like garbage collection doesn't occur Yeah, but to write code like that is obtuse to say the least.

675
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:47,910
Rym: And if you fuck anything up all those games are out the window.

676
00:42:48,231 --> 00:42:54,450
Rym: Yeah, it's that it's like that times a million with all the FPGA platforms and vendors sell like FPGA cards.

677
00:42:55,158 --> 00:42:56,090
Rym: They're all different.

678
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,655
Rym: You have to be an expert in that implementation.

679
00:42:58,816 --> 00:43:07,789
Scott: if you get just the like the documents like Explaining all the features of just one of these things like the data file or whatever That could be your whole job in life.

680
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:16,152
Rym: Yes If you become an expert in one FPGA platform You could get a job at like a hedge fund and it doesn't help not only Right.

681
00:43:16,353 --> 00:43:19,683
Scott: Are there like multiple different eight PGA's that are all really really different.

682
00:43:20,004 --> 00:43:21,850
Scott: There's two minutes more than one vendor.

683
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:27,170
Scott: There's two major vendors and they both use different words to refer to everything.

684
00:43:28,191 --> 00:43:30,218
Scott: There's no standard terminology.

685
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:36,006
Scott: So like if you learn like one vendors FPGAs You're gonna be really confused if you suddenly have to work on one from the other.

686
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:50,466
Rym: vendor Problem in practice at least in my industry and it's funny because the reason this came up is because I mentioned I'm on a panel in Mumbai on April 22nd called low latency trading what is working and what is not.

687
00:43:50,766 --> 00:43:57,248
Rym: and there are four topics We're discussing and it's me and a bunch of like managing directs all these like people wouldn't be.

688
00:43:57,288 --> 00:44:01,770
Scott: amount of money You had to pay someone to develop your FPGA stuff not be able to make up for the money.

689
00:44:02,495 --> 00:44:04,330
Rym: I wonder what rims gonna say on this panel.

690
00:44:05,031 --> 00:44:09,650
Scott: So and the time it takes to make it here the for time want to be obsolete by the time you're done developing.

691
00:44:10,512 --> 00:44:12,450
Rym: Here are the four topics on this panel.

692
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:13,781
Rym: Let's see if you can pick out which ones.

693
00:44:13,861 --> 00:44:14,950
Rym: rims got a lot to say about.

694
00:44:15,171 --> 00:44:15,994
Scott: All right, all of them.

695
00:44:16,235 --> 00:44:18,485
Rym: the use of fix and low latency trading environments.

696
00:44:18,726 --> 00:44:19,249
Scott: That's what you do.

697
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:20,893
Rym: FPGA cards.

698
00:44:21,335 --> 00:44:29,446
Rym: Yep, the adoption of the fixed protocol in Indian markets and Setting the clocks in India the need for the precision time protocol.

699
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:29,988
Rym: There you go.

700
00:44:30,129 --> 00:44:32,696
Rym: Yeah I'm gonna shit all over PTP.

701
00:44:33,198 --> 00:44:36,968
Scott: Anyway, anyway, so let me talk about all the other problems.

702
00:44:37,089 --> 00:44:40,623
Rym: FPGAs Okay, then I'll talk about how this is actually done in the real world.

703
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:44,137
Scott: So for another problem They have they don't give a shit about power.

704
00:44:44,479 --> 00:44:46,145
Scott: They will just drain your fucking battery.

705
00:44:46,426 --> 00:44:47,008
Scott: Fuck you, right?

706
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,987
Scott: It takes a lot of power to keep that going because our low power FPGA.

707
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:55,490
Scott: Yeah, that's still not as low power as regular dedicated process.

708
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:59,504
Rym: Yeah, the problem is like even alternative solutions like using GPUs.

709
00:44:59,926 --> 00:45:00,367
Scott: GPUs

710
00:45:00,407 --> 00:45:01,572
Rym: are not low power No,

711
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:14,709
Scott: but I mean in addition to the power that it takes to actually You know do the processing and run the clocks or whatever you got going on with the FPGA You also have extra power going in to sort of keep it in the shape that you want it to be in.

712
00:45:14,769 --> 00:45:18,547
Scott: as soon as The power is cut all those transistors just go clunk back to zero.

713
00:45:18,889 --> 00:45:23,022
Rym: now That kind of problem is mostly been dealt with over the years.

714
00:45:23,062 --> 00:45:24,367
Rym: the same way that hard drives.

715
00:45:24,407 --> 00:45:37,981
Rym: you like hard drives unless you have a shit server have got some form of write caching meaning writes are coming in to the disk and The thing between your program in the disk tells the program.

716
00:45:38,062 --> 00:45:38,683
Rym: Yeah, I got it.

717
00:45:38,703 --> 00:45:46,170
Rym: Yeah, but it's not actually on the disk yet It's in a buffer somewhere and they either have capacitors or they're caching it to flash.

718
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:49,020
Rym: They're doing things to persist that data.

719
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:49,240
Rym: Yep.

720
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:50,705
Rym: That's a solved problem.

721
00:45:50,926 --> 00:45:58,594
Scott: Also FPGAs Right while so let's consider this scenario right we take an FPGA and FPGAs are fast.

722
00:45:58,915 --> 00:45:59,698
Scott: It's a mean it's.

723
00:45:59,879 --> 00:46:01,163
Scott: it's a hardware device.

724
00:46:01,223 --> 00:46:03,070
Scott: It's it's ridiculously fast hardware speed.

725
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:14,626
Scott: Yeah, but if I program an FPGA to do the same thing as a 486 unless it's some crazy big FPGA It's still probably gonna be slower at that then a 486 would be yep.

726
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:18,118
Rym: So you have to solve a very constrained problem with.

727
00:46:18,158 --> 00:46:21,528
Scott: but if I put two 486 is in one FPGA.

728
00:46:21,548 --> 00:46:22,993
Scott: now Daddy's cooking.

729
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:32,018
Rym: So think of this like an FPGA to do everything that my computer from 1996 does would be a nightmare.

730
00:46:32,238 --> 00:46:42,804
Rym: You're right, but an FPGA that encodes h2 64 video That would be so much better than a general-purpose processor that you wouldn't believe it.

731
00:46:42,905 --> 00:46:44,750
Rym: Yeah orders of magnitude faster.

732
00:46:45,432 --> 00:46:50,250
Scott: Now we already talked about how expensive it is to get someone to write, you know to configure and program.

733
00:46:50,757 --> 00:46:51,448
Rym: Fucking chips are.

734
00:46:52,914 --> 00:46:55,121
Scott: The chips are also redic expensive.

735
00:46:55,181 --> 00:46:56,666
Rym: now you have some at work, but they're not.

736
00:46:56,967 --> 00:46:58,030
Rym: they're not real FPGAs.

737
00:46:58,030 --> 00:47:04,530
Rym: They're basically this company called solar flare their network cards that have sort of an excellent use of FPGA.

738
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:05,753
Rym: Yes hardware progress.

739
00:47:05,774 --> 00:47:07,198
Rym: So say I'm doing a packet capture, right?

740
00:47:07,218 --> 00:47:07,338
Rym: Mm-hmm.

741
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:11,390
Rym: I can have the filtering happen in the hardware.

742
00:47:11,591 --> 00:47:13,942
Rym: Yep, that is crazy and awesome.

743
00:47:14,605 --> 00:47:23,421
Rym: I could have reactive loops I could have the card to have code or if certain kinds of data come in Data comes back out without even hitting my buses.

744
00:47:23,662 --> 00:47:25,930
Rym: Yep, like that's the kind of shit you can do, right?

745
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:27,723
Rym: but that's not just an FPGA.

746
00:47:28,065 --> 00:47:29,733
Rym: that is a Specific.

747
00:47:29,854 --> 00:47:31,419
Rym: it's like one layer above that.

748
00:47:31,459 --> 00:47:34,830
Rym: it's using similar types of technology or solving similar problems.

749
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:36,294
Rym: But you're another layer.

750
00:47:36,335 --> 00:47:41,230
Rym: abstracted like it solves network related massively parallel or high-performance problems.

751
00:47:42,097 --> 00:47:44,173
Scott: But yeah, they're really expensive They're not.

752
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:53,260
Scott: I mean if you get the big fancy ones, they could be a lot of money But I mean even cheap ones right small ones She still more money that like life.

753
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,760
Scott: you take an FPGA and you program it to do something simple And then you want to put that in an actual product.

754
00:47:59,323 --> 00:48:01,110
Scott: You're just pissing away money.

755
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:06,567
Scott: You were better off buying a chip that was already equivalent to whatever you made that FPGA do so here.

756
00:48:06,627 --> 00:48:07,570
Rym: a recent solar flare.

757
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:13,430
Rym: So a solar flan flare on the 70 like a 7-series card, you know, it's just a network card.

758
00:48:13,772 --> 00:48:16,229
Rym: I can buy one on Amazon for a thousand dollars.

759
00:48:16,702 --> 00:48:22,950
Rym: Yeah Your card on your server cost zero because that comes with your mother built in in the motherboard.

760
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:25,398
Scott: Yeah, when the days when we bought them they were five bucks.

761
00:48:25,438 --> 00:48:30,555
Rym: Yes, and that was this card has it's a Thousand-dollar network card.

762
00:48:30,776 --> 00:48:35,130
Rym: So if you design software that needs this solar flare card.

763
00:48:35,772 --> 00:48:39,770
Rym: Everyone who buys your software also has to buy a thousand-dollar network card.

764
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:42,279
Scott: Yeah, so it's not about networking right.

765
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,370
Scott: networking is a thing that's really easy to do in parallel, right?

766
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:50,070
Scott: You have a whole lot of Ethernet cables coming in to a switch or something and you got a whole bunch of packets.

767
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:53,946
Rym: It's a whole lot of packets that need to be muxed and demuxed to applications.

768
00:48:54,026 --> 00:48:54,970
Rym: It's like the perfect storm.

769
00:48:55,191 --> 00:49:03,809
Rym: Yeah, the FPGA or the specialized hardware can like split Incoming TCP packets inside of one fancy FPGA.

770
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:14,909
Scott: You can basically put like hundreds of little chips that in hardware each can process TCP IP packets all the way from the Ethernet all the way up to that level.

771
00:49:15,713 --> 00:49:25,223
Scott: and so this chip is basically doing all that work in hardware at ridiculously high speed and It only passes on the packets to the computer that you need.

772
00:49:25,263 --> 00:49:31,469
Scott: you could have like a hundred Ethernet Gigabit Ethernet cards plugged into your computer with this one FPGA just taking care of everything.

773
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:37,899
Rym: now I think just from my like professional perspective like the work I do and just my life as a technologist.

774
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:49,223
Rym: I Super useful for but high performance computing.

775
00:49:49,424 --> 00:49:51,209
Rym: I think that is a dead end.

776
00:49:51,499 --> 00:50:00,126
Scott: Yeah I mean in these days You're probably better off just getting a whole bunch of regular CPUs for the parallel or you want to.

777
00:50:00,146 --> 00:50:05,119
Scott: you need to have a very very Specific or limited use case to need an FPGA.

778
00:50:05,179 --> 00:50:09,690
Scott: certain industries certain kinds of devices certain people, you know They still need them.

779
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:20,403
Rym: It's not like we should stop making them But like even in my industry right like in software with Java we're down to like sub 20 microsecond processing times for these things.

780
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:21,988
Rym: right things we're talking about.

781
00:50:22,008 --> 00:50:29,422
Rym: a Well programmed FPGA could probably do that similar task down to about At best like 8 to 10.

782
00:50:29,422 --> 00:50:32,036
Rym: Mm-hmm If 10 microseconds matters.

783
00:50:32,056 --> 00:50:35,370
Rym: that much like how much you're willing to pay to save 10 microseconds.

784
00:50:35,551 --> 00:50:36,999
Scott: Yeah, and are you ready?

785
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:37,301
Scott: What?

786
00:50:37,462 --> 00:50:38,730
Scott: what happens when it messes up?

787
00:50:39,851 --> 00:50:46,505
Rym: If the if anything changes in the market and you have to do something differently, yeah You gotta hire that million-dollar developer again.

788
00:50:46,525 --> 00:50:47,129
Rym: Mm-hmm.

789
00:50:47,351 --> 00:50:50,490
Scott: There's not too many people out there who can do something that complicated, right?

790
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:54,829
Scott: It's like programming it to be an Ethernet card is already pretty complex.

791
00:50:55,332 --> 00:50:58,069
Scott: Programming to do anything fancier is really hard.

792
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:08,174
Rym: So in my opinion the real way to do this kind of thing because the problem most people are solving is some massively parallel problem Like Video encoding.

793
00:51:08,334 --> 00:51:12,146
Scott: it has to be something digital right if it's usually has high input output.

794
00:51:12,568 --> 00:51:14,543
Scott: high input output That's what all the pins are for.

795
00:51:14,563 --> 00:51:18,057
Scott: Yeah, or So it has to be purely digital.

796
00:51:18,097 --> 00:51:20,970
Scott: You can't be doing any like analog processing on there.

797
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:29,450
Scott: What you can do though is you can get a whole bunch of ADCs Stack those up next to an FPGA and then the FPGA can do a bunch of work.

798
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:32,002
Rym: These are the worst things in the world.

799
00:51:32,143 --> 00:51:32,685
Scott: No, they're not.

800
00:51:32,725 --> 00:51:33,388
Scott: I'm not saying that.

801
00:51:33,449 --> 00:51:44,470
Scott: I'm saying Welcome to heat and power sure but like let's say you have I don't know radio signals coming in from like 20 like a thousand antennas.

802
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,532
Rym: Yeah so you do a.

803
00:51:45,692 --> 00:51:55,930
Scott: you have an ADC on each one and you can have like one FPGA processing all those radio signals in parallel and Then outputting it to a bunch of storage devices really quickly.

804
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:59,506
Scott: So I would practice but you could just do that with much more.

805
00:51:59,767 --> 00:52:05,310
Scott: less work Would be to just stack up a whole bunch of regular old CPUs one per antenna.

806
00:52:05,851 --> 00:52:06,834
Rym: It comes down to like.

807
00:52:07,115 --> 00:52:09,883
Rym: do you need some sort of hardware advantage?

808
00:52:09,903 --> 00:52:12,430
Rym: Do you need a hard real-time solution?

809
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:15,938
Rym: Do you have like you have some very specific constraint?

810
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:20,290
Rym: most of the time you don't or you do but the money you would take?

811
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:23,059
Rym: To actually meet that constraint Obviates the need.

812
00:52:23,743 --> 00:52:30,465
Rym: so in practice Honestly use like use a framework that is easier to code in.

813
00:52:30,766 --> 00:52:33,493
Rym: that is also massively parallel like Nvidia's CUDA stuff.

814
00:52:33,653 --> 00:52:33,874
Rym: Yep.

815
00:52:34,195 --> 00:52:42,382
Rym: I mean if you you you Scott could write code that would take advantage of CUDA Yes, anyway, anyone who can code can do that.

816
00:52:42,542 --> 00:52:47,138
Rym: Yes, and like right now like in fact I have done so and that stuff is already used.

817
00:52:47,479 --> 00:53:06,293
Rym: CUDA cores like CUDA processing is used in a lot of practical Applications that are not like ridiculous finance like billion-dollar solutions and There's a new thing on the horizon that I didn't know a lot about But I've been learning a lot about it lately probably as I'm talking on that panel, but Intel Had.

818
00:53:06,414 --> 00:53:08,219
Rym: this is what's gonna replace FPGA.

819
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:12,601
Rym: I think Intel has their Xeon Phi coprocessor.

820
00:53:13,472 --> 00:53:24,769
Rym: The vague idea is that these new Xeon chips and the boards that support them will have normal Xeon cores and then they have these like vector cores that do this shit.

821
00:53:24,789 --> 00:53:27,499
Rym: and The important part is not the hardware.

822
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:45,830
Rym: The hardware is amazing and all these kinds of things like When people who are experts of this try to explain to me like the cache concurrency problems they deal with and like what kinds of buffers are used and like how like Physically how the chips are laid out and how you should allocate memory in your applications to match that.

823
00:53:46,491 --> 00:53:48,308
Rym: I'm not smart enough to understand that stuff.

824
00:53:49,153 --> 00:53:52,590
Rym: But as a result, the hardware is not the interesting solution.

825
00:53:53,051 --> 00:53:59,970
Rym: The interesting solution is the software support to allow normal developers to use this shit.

826
00:54:01,114 --> 00:54:11,208
Rym: So Intel is a company I think that has the resources to provide the tools that many people who work at Intel are at the FPGA programming genius level.

827
00:54:11,751 --> 00:54:17,006
Rym: Yes, but you can't use those solutions relying only on people like that.

828
00:54:17,046 --> 00:54:18,310
Rym: You need a layer in between.

829
00:54:18,791 --> 00:54:22,664
Rym: I mean how many people still write assembly like that happens?

830
00:54:22,684 --> 00:54:29,290
Rym: many there are uses for that But most of the work in the world gets done at least a couple of layers above assembly.

831
00:54:29,511 --> 00:54:34,899
Rym: Yeah, so Intel's PHY framework PHI Been learning a lot about it.

832
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,430
Rym: And basically it looks like that.

833
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:38,498
Rym: This is as best I can tell.

834
00:54:38,538 --> 00:54:40,124
Rym: like these things will take.

835
00:54:40,204 --> 00:54:45,443
Rym: threads like you can just write C code Like you don't need to worry a lot about what's going underneath.

836
00:54:45,764 --> 00:54:47,570
Rym: You just have to worry about advertising.

837
00:54:48,012 --> 00:54:49,598
Rym: Yeah, well, this is more than just advertising.

838
00:54:49,698 --> 00:54:55,570
Rym: I have a pretty thick slide deck here of a. This is a class on how to write the code.

839
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:56,957
Scott: I should make a thick slide deck.

840
00:54:57,077 --> 00:54:57,660
Rym: you want to see this.

841
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:01,439
Rym: shit like this goes way beyond the level I can really understand without this.

842
00:55:01,459 --> 00:55:12,379
Rym: make a crazy slide deck and everyone will believe it maybe but this is like a crash course I'm looking at on how to write code for these things and This looks way more doable.

843
00:55:12,399 --> 00:55:15,772
Rym: and the other problem the other reason I think this is interesting that is Intel.

844
00:55:15,792 --> 00:55:20,389
Rym: Intel has the ability to make these things just exist on everyone's computers.

845
00:55:20,409 --> 00:55:28,908
Rym: if If these coprocessors are just kind of standard on high-end servers You can write code that assumes they're there.

846
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:32,850
Rym: You can't do that with just FPGAs.

847
00:55:34,894 --> 00:55:36,889
Scott: See an FPGA is a thing.

848
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:45,233
Scott: it's useful in the world in many places, but most for most people it's never useful and It's just mostly.

849
00:55:45,294 --> 00:55:52,194
Scott: the thing about them is that like the fact that they exist is like some like miraculous Amazing thing.

850
00:55:52,234 --> 00:56:00,242
Scott: it's like it's a chip that you can program to become any chip Which then itself can be programmed if you want it to be.

851
00:56:00,262 --> 00:56:01,166
Rym: oh my god.

852
00:56:01,226 --> 00:56:01,888
Rym: It just runs Linux.

853
00:56:02,672 --> 00:56:06,250
Rym: Okay, I gotta read a lot more about this before I talk about it in depth on the show.

854
00:56:06,412 --> 00:56:14,657
Scott: But yeah If you're more if that if the fact the concept that an FPGA is a chip that can become other chips Fascinates you.

855
00:56:15,222 --> 00:56:16,230
Scott: just go on YouTube.

856
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:18,317
Scott: There's like a bunch of videos all about this.

857
00:56:18,357 --> 00:56:21,406
Scott: that will be incomprehensible, but will make you go.

858
00:56:21,487 --> 00:56:21,888
Scott: Whoa.

859
00:56:21,908 --> 00:56:22,530
Scott: That's crazy.

860
00:56:22,771 --> 00:56:36,910
Rym: Oh, but if you want to get a job unless you're doing integrated circuits for like hardware product applications Either look at this Intel stuff or get really good at Nvidia's CUDA stuff because that is actual practical useful money-making skill.

861
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:41,750
Scott: Well, I mean if you learn FPGAs, you can also make a lot of money if you're like VHDL or something.

862
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:42,492
Scott: But you're going.

863
00:56:42,512 --> 00:56:48,550
Scott: the places you can work are only places that are actually using those they're gonna work at like a battery company.

864
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:50,829
Rym: You're gonna work at a hedge fund.

865
00:56:51,211 --> 00:57:06,910
Scott: There there are places that you can work if you learn it and you're working the NSA like doing signal processing yeah, who knows what you're gonna do, but For most people in the real world, you will never need them and rarely will they be the correct optimal choice.

866
00:57:07,231 --> 00:57:10,099
Rym: Yeah, anything look at these other things because there's.

867
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,150
Rym: there's a more general application to these other things like CUDA.

868
00:57:14,511 --> 00:57:17,960
Scott: Yeah, if FPGAs were really the awesomest we would already.

869
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,426
Scott: it's like there's not some weird reason.

870
00:57:20,446 --> 00:57:21,890
Scott: We don't all have them in our computer.

871
00:57:22,091 --> 00:57:22,993
Rym: Yeah, well kind of like.

872
00:57:23,013 --> 00:57:28,110
Rym: remember, you know, like RISC systems versus CISC systems or like token ring was deterministic.

873
00:57:28,651 --> 00:57:34,510
Rym: Well, yeah and token ring is gone now, even though it was better in a lot of ways than Ethernet.

874
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:35,635
Rym: I wonder why that is.

875
00:57:35,676 --> 00:57:38,087
Scott: beta max is gone now in a lot of ways.

876
00:57:38,147 --> 00:57:48,523
Rym: in VHS This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

877
00:57:48,564 --> 00:57:53,714
Rym: special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat Lee for web design and Brand ok for the logos.

878
00:57:53,915 --> 00:57:55,901
Scott: be sure to visit our website at front row.

879
00:57:55,921 --> 00:57:58,950
Scott: crew calm for show notes discussion news and more.

880
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:06,610
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.
