00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,270
Rym: It's Thursday April 20th 2023.

2
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:17,673
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:17,994 --> 00:00:19,335
Rym: We're talking about magic.

4
00:00:22,058 --> 00:00:23,400
Scott: I forgot to push record.

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,284
Scott: That's why I delayed my.

6
00:00:24,385 --> 00:00:24,726
Scott: I'm Scott.

7
00:00:24,948 --> 00:00:27,440
Scott: I push record and then said I'm Scott immediately.

8
00:00:29,621 --> 00:00:30,691
Scott: Let's do this.

9
00:00:30,711 --> 00:00:35,093
Scott: I Finished ye book club book a few days ago.

10
00:00:35,113 --> 00:00:36,800
Scott: I think I said that in the last podcast.

11
00:00:38,082 --> 00:00:39,006
Rym: I'll be ready to rock.

12
00:00:39,408 --> 00:00:43,887
Scott: All right today was the day it was due at the library and I Admit to go earlier, but I just didn't.

13
00:00:44,148 --> 00:00:46,718
Scott: thankfully the library was open today until 8 p.m.

14
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:55,800
Scott: so I went immediately after work and before the show and I go into the library and I go up the stairs and there's a. there's a metal hatch on the outside of the library.

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:07,340
Scott: This is book depository and I'm like, ah, yes like the olden days I love this book in a hole in the side of the building and Leave without having to enter or speak to a human like you used to do at the blockbuster video.

16
00:01:08,044 --> 00:01:11,654
Scott: yep, and the hatch had a padlock on it.

17
00:01:11,715 --> 00:01:20,920
Scott: now The padlock looks so shitty that I'm sure even me If I had if I had bought some some tools from the lock-making lawyer, I could have opened.

18
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:24,856
Rym: I am confident that padlock means this slot goes nowhere.

19
00:01:24,896 --> 00:01:25,298
Rym: good do not.

20
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:33,000
Scott: There was no place of honor and there was no reason to even attempt that because the library was still open.

21
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:41,211
Scott: So I go inside and I see a librarian and I'm like I would like to return this book and I'm expect I'm expecting them To just take it out of my hands and let me leave.

22
00:01:41,794 --> 00:01:42,840
Scott: that was not what happened.

23
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,817
Scott: They said use that machine over there.

24
00:01:45,837 --> 00:01:50,060
Scott: now That machine over there was clearly not an ultra modern machine.

25
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:52,936
Scott: That machine has probably been there for at least a decade or two.

26
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:54,806
Rym: You got to get a crank out.

27
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,740
Rym: crank it a little bit till it starts sputtering like what's going on here.

28
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:06,166
Scott: I've you know, but me not having taken a physical book out of a library since Physical book out of the library.

29
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:07,671
Scott: that was our icy library.

30
00:02:07,691 --> 00:02:08,794
Scott: So 20 20 something years, right?

31
00:02:08,835 --> 00:02:11,718
Scott: Yeah 2022 was the.

32
00:02:11,718 --> 00:02:17,080
Rym: 2002 was the last time I took a physical book out of a physical library.

33
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:18,705
Rym: So malice aforethought.

34
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:20,812
Scott: so the way this machine worked is there's.

35
00:02:20,852 --> 00:02:29,740
Scott: basically it looks sort of like one of those big ATMs kind of like that or maybe more like Like the post office machine similar to the post office one.

36
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,539
Rym: That machine is impressive and that you can do fucking anything on it.

37
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:37,220
Rym: But it is also terrible because it takes about 10 minutes to do anything on it, right?

38
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,864
Scott: So the way this.

39
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:40,020
Scott: but this machine is much simpler and its functionality.

40
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:47,660
Scott: there was a screen and there was a big hole that was large enough to fit in most books and Basically the hole didn't even have a hatch.

41
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,925
Scott: It was just always open.

42
00:02:49,487 --> 00:02:54,688
Scott: and we all you did is you took the book barcode facing down Right and you stick it in the hole.

43
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:57,379
Rym: What are the consequences if you put the book in the wrong way?

44
00:02:58,881 --> 00:03:04,202
Scott: I guess it might tell you take it out and put it back in but basically as soon as it scanned the barcode Right.

45
00:03:04,603 --> 00:03:20,200
Scott: It had a little conveyor belt and it took the book inside and I didn't hear like a cathunk like it wasn't dropping the Book, I think it was like elevating it somewhere that it doesn't damage it Or maybe bringing it into a room behind the machine possibly because there was a room behind the machine.

46
00:03:20,843 --> 00:03:23,680
Scott: But the machine also had a large storage compartment anyway.

47
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:32,190
Scott: After it it took the book like in a second basically and then was like, alright Do you want a receipt paper email or none?

48
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,837
Scott: and I'm just like normally.

49
00:03:33,877 --> 00:03:46,910
Scott: I would say none But I chose email just as I wanted to see right and it basically immediately emailed me Because it knew that I was the one who had the book and it was like yes you have we have confirmed you ever turned Your book on time.

50
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,099
Scott: This was the book.

51
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,521
Scott: Bye.

52
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:53,293
Scott: I was like, oh that's probably an old technology.

53
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,420
Scott: There's nothing particularly amazing about it.

54
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:00,715
Scott: It's a barcode scanner and a conveyor belt and a screened right and a network connection.

55
00:04:00,795 --> 00:04:02,360
Scott: is nothing really fancy going on there.

56
00:04:03,003 --> 00:04:13,088
Scott: It was just and it clearly wasn't new because it's that was a. you know It wasn't a shiny brand new machine with a ribbon cutting That way for a long time.

57
00:04:13,148 --> 00:04:16,100
Rym: we don't as a society invest particularly much in our libraries.

58
00:04:16,805 --> 00:04:17,813
Scott: Yeah, but it's like.

59
00:04:17,954 --> 00:04:22,174
Scott: I just you know It was my first experience with a digital book return.

60
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:25,407
Scott: being someone who hasn't used The book I remember many score at RIT.

61
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,931
Rym: There's just a hole in like the desk like there's the.

62
00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:36,340
Rym: there was the counter desk and there's a hole there and you just Throw it in the hall.

63
00:04:36,511 --> 00:04:42,019
Scott: Yeah You would check the book out from a person who would scan it with a handheld barcode scanner and you to return it.

64
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:42,882
Scott: you put In a hole.

65
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:47,120
Scott: it went in a bin and someone's job was to process the bin later, right?

66
00:04:47,781 --> 00:04:48,082
Scott: You did it.

67
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:50,349
Rym: and that was thinking back to blockbuster videos.

68
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:53,480
Rym: and it's funny because a lot of kids like think back to like.

69
00:04:53,541 --> 00:05:01,985
Rym: Oh, I remember blockbuster video But we're old enough to remember that blockbuster video was the bad thing that destroyed all the good video stars that came before it like They never even well that era.

70
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:02,205
Scott: Yes.

71
00:05:02,366 --> 00:05:06,800
Scott: Yes and no right because on the one hand we had the local video store, right?

72
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:12,459
Rym: Well, it was regional some local video stores a plus some local stores d-minus.

73
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:24,120
Scott: Well, it was a balance right the local video store had cool niche Biz right that you know, you couldn't find in a blockbuster which you know didn't have a very deep selection, right?

74
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,398
Scott: They had just popular stuff.

75
00:05:25,861 --> 00:05:36,780
Scott: But if you wanted to see the thing that just came out in VHS just now Right the blockbuster had 50 some odd copies, right and it's like sure sometimes all of them would be taken.

76
00:05:37,662 --> 00:05:41,160
Scott: Usually you could get like one or it's there would been being one that was returned.

77
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:47,020
Rym: And I remember because we had already seen Jurassic Park like twice in the theater and then we just own that one.

78
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,777
Rym: No, but when it came out on VHS, we were just cuz we didn't buy it right away.

79
00:05:51,797 --> 00:05:56,637
Rym: We're just like Let's watch Jurassic Park and there's a wall of Jurassic Park and there was not.

80
00:05:56,677 --> 00:06:00,500
Rym: there was no Jurassic Park tape behind any of those boxes.

81
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:09,900
Scott: Yeah, but you know what if you went that's the thing is you would go to blockbuster and like the whole wall of Jurassic Parks would be gone and then you'd go to the front.

82
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,526
Rym: But look in the bin and you.

83
00:06:11,546 --> 00:06:18,433
Scott: but if you just went to them if you just went to the mall to whatever your store Was Suncoast or FYE or whatever you had right?

84
00:06:18,775 --> 00:06:19,438
Scott: You could just buy it.

85
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,772
Scott: It was there just to buy for 20 bucks or rent but blockbuster five bucks.

86
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:27,594
Scott: No, not five.

87
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:28,496
Rym: blockbuster was 350.

88
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:31,158
Scott: I Guess I don't remember what?

89
00:06:32,261 --> 00:06:33,245
Scott: Who's cheaper than right?

90
00:06:33,305 --> 00:06:34,992
Rym: I mean that was 350 in late 80s dollars.

91
00:06:35,032 --> 00:06:37,060
Rym: So that's like a hundred dollars today anyway.

92
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:42,060
Scott: Yeah, but the point was is that you know anyway, yeah.

93
00:06:42,422 --> 00:06:51,100
Rym: So in some news, this is some pretty big deal news But it's unfortunately not as big as it could have been but we'll see because there's more going on here.

94
00:06:51,180 --> 00:07:02,380
Rym: So if you recall during the previous American presidential election One of the candidates was an evil fascist who also attempted a coup to overturn the fact that he lost that election.

95
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:09,700
Rym: in America, there's a bunch of news networks and They're all pretty much like center-right through center-left.

96
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,820
Rym: And there's a couple that are like far far left by American standards meaning center-right by European standards.

97
00:07:16,441 --> 00:07:26,625
Rym: but then there's one network that's basically just the fascist network like they just lie all the time like it is just Shockingly egregious propaganda.

98
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:31,962
Scott: and in America the way the way they get away with it right technically speaking is that first of all is the First Amendment.

99
00:07:32,003 --> 00:07:41,140
Scott: it's not against a lot of lie if it's not liable or slander or something Right, and two they basically have some programs even though the network is called Fox News, right?

100
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:48,648
Scott: Yeah, some of the programs are like news at 11, which if you watch it is Typical, you know news.

101
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:51,300
Scott: It's not good, but it's like it's typical news.

102
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:51,465
Scott: Crime.

103
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:54,980
Rym: There was a car crash on Fifth Avenue.

104
00:07:56,002 --> 00:07:56,846
Scott: Yeah, it's bad.

105
00:07:56,926 --> 00:07:57,388
Scott: But it's just.

106
00:07:57,509 --> 00:07:58,673
Scott: it's actually news right?

107
00:07:58,693 --> 00:08:00,139
Scott: They're not lying on it.

108
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:08,239
Scott: And then they have programs like so-and-so fascist guy the show right where white guy rants at TV.

109
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,986
Scott: It's on a news network.

110
00:08:10,046 --> 00:08:13,300
Scott: It says news on the screen, but that's not a news show.

111
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,791
Scott: That's basically just no different than some radio ranty guy just right.

112
00:08:18,614 --> 00:08:19,797
Scott: and then those shows are.

113
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:21,060
Scott: the shows are all the lying happens.

114
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:23,626
Rym: Those shows are basically they're not.

115
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,151
Scott: they're not technically news.

116
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:25,412
Scott: There's.

117
00:08:25,552 --> 00:08:33,659
Rym: it's like there's a clip from a movie that Rit is taken like so egregiously out of context that I cringe every time I ever see anyone reference it.

118
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:39,140
Rym: But if you ever seen an old movie called the network There's a scene where there's an old guy on TV like on a news looking show.

119
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:43,980
Rym: That's a lot like what Scott describes and he just goes off on a rant like you've got to get mad.

120
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:51,020
Rym: It's Fox News is basically that except that guy was crazy and being manipulated by the network.

121
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:52,545
Rym: This one's the other way around.

122
00:08:52,846 --> 00:08:54,432
Rym: they know exactly what they're doing.

123
00:08:54,653 --> 00:08:56,720
Rym: Everyone involved knows exactly what they're doing.

124
00:08:56,901 --> 00:08:59,097
Scott: It's by design and they're okay with it.

125
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:13,300
Rym: Yep so, uh, of course, they just lied about the American presidential election and they egregiously defamed Of the company that makes most American voting machines along the way Dominion.

126
00:09:13,363 --> 00:09:21,723
Scott: Yeah they basically just like here are legitimate criticisms of voting machines and electronic voting that many internet digital people have made and To make.

127
00:09:21,763 --> 00:09:24,075
Rym: yeah, I don't have a high opinion of Dominion as a company.

128
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,945
Rym: No But they lied.

129
00:09:26,985 --> 00:09:32,640
Rym: they literally just were saying Dominion stole the election from Trump like pretty much directly.

130
00:09:33,526 --> 00:09:34,251
Scott: And it's not.

131
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:35,540
Scott: that part is not true.

132
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:47,595
Rym: and they also were uncritically airing claims about that by other people like Rudy Giuliani and down like the crazy people a pillow guy like all those types of people.

133
00:09:48,197 --> 00:09:55,360
Rym: So, uh Their argument was that nothing we're doing is defamation because we're reporting on something newsworthy.

134
00:09:55,721 --> 00:10:02,940
Rym: And is it not newsworthy that a presidential candidate and his team are saying that the election was stolen from them?

135
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:10,820
Rym: So they were saying that they were saying that those other people were saying instead of actually just saying it directly.

136
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,907
Scott: Well, I mean that's that's a legitimate argument.

137
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:15,876
Scott: But if you watch the broadcasts, you'll see that that's not true.

138
00:10:16,518 --> 00:10:17,040
Scott: It's not true.

139
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,843
Scott: That's not what they were.

140
00:10:17,924 --> 00:10:29,614
Scott: if if they were saying like if they had a news anchor be like, ah, yes Crazy right-wing person says this yeah, right But evidence is that is not true then they could.

141
00:10:29,794 --> 00:10:31,580
Scott: then that's perfectly fine news reporting.

142
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:37,040
Scott: I imagine the other not evil or less evil news networks did report exactly in that fashion.

143
00:10:37,241 --> 00:10:45,420
Scott: Yeah, but if you watch their news reports, it's like no they didn't do that Even though they might have said they tried to argue in court that they were doing something.

144
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:49,606
Rym: So in American defamation locks We have a lot of overseas listeners like I

145
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,738
Scott: was a lot harder to make a case here than many other countries in

146
00:10:52,758 --> 00:10:52,879
Rym: the

147
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:55,167
Scott: US Countries, it's too easy to make a case

148
00:10:55,207 --> 00:10:58,840
Rym: like in some countries in Europe and I'm looking at you Britain in particular.

149
00:11:00,021 --> 00:11:01,667
Rym: Being right isn't necessary.

150
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:04,900
Rym: Like if you are truthful that doesn't necessarily protect you from defamation.

151
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,909
Scott: It's just one of those things where no country gets it.

152
00:11:06,989 --> 00:11:09,802
Scott: right now really it's like at least if there is a country that gets it Right.

153
00:11:09,863 --> 00:11:10,449
Scott: I'm not aware of.

154
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:19,223
Scott: Yeah, I just see all sorts of stories from all sorts of countries and every time I see a libel or defamation Lawsuit story.

155
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:24,295
Scott: It's either Wow, that country is way too easy or way too hard to.

156
00:11:24,496 --> 00:11:26,260
Rym: it's always the first bear or the second bear.

157
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:27,813
Rym: Nobody's got the third bear.

158
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:28,660
Rym: Everything's just right.

159
00:11:29,421 --> 00:11:43,746
Rym: Yeah, so but it goes way worse than this because so of course Dominion sued and in America you have to prove that one the claims were actually false and - you have to prove if I'm not a lawyer.

160
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:51,951
Rym: I'm summarizing that the people making the claims Weren't just stupid and wrong, but they knew it was wrong.

161
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:58,405
Rym: They knew it was a lie and they were doing it with malicious intent Intending to cause harm.

162
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:04,400
Scott: Yeah, well and it just so happens that there was evidence that they knew that they were lying red-handed evidence.

163
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:08,236
Scott: Their internal discussions were like we know this is a line.

164
00:12:08,276 --> 00:12:09,120
Scott: we're gonna say it on TV.

165
00:12:09,324 --> 00:12:18,373
Rym: Anyway, yep lawyers got all the internal emails and it's you've got all these fascist hosts sending each other like Emails and writing saying things like this bad shit crazy bullshit.

166
00:12:18,394 --> 00:12:20,020
Rym: They were about to say is a lie.

167
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:23,296
Rym: I'm going to say it anyway for crime reasons.

168
00:12:23,357 --> 00:12:23,840
Rym: effectively

169
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:24,880
Scott: Yep,

170
00:12:25,582 --> 00:12:31,843
Rym: so they were almost definitely gonna lose this lawsuit because another thing that happened is They

171
00:12:32,123 --> 00:12:33,066
Scott: not your opinion,

172
00:12:33,327 --> 00:12:34,230
Rym: oh, yeah this no this

173
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,233
Scott: I agree with yep,

174
00:12:35,835 --> 00:12:46,639
Rym: they withheld a huge amount of those communications Illegally and they got fucked over in court over it and had to hand over the rest and sanctioned by the judge.

175
00:12:47,982 --> 00:12:58,516
Rym: so the trial against the fascist news network in America was about to happen and The Dominion was asking for 1.6 billion dollars in damages.

176
00:12:58,877 --> 00:12:59,379
Scott: seems good.

177
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:11,020
Rym: Yeah They settled with Fox Literally like within an hour of the trial start like jury selection started and then suddenly everybody settled which is not uncommon in America.

178
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,634
Rym: That is like the most common outcome for trials except when poor people are involved.

179
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,560
Scott: That's a very basic strategy, right?

180
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:25,680
Scott: It's like, you know settle to avoid the costly Time-consuming trial that will only make matters worse for you and the American legal system.

181
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,580
Scott: Don't settle until the last second so you can get the best possible deal, right?

182
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,946
Scott: Why would you settle early exactly?

183
00:13:30,986 --> 00:13:34,360
Scott: It's the same reason that people trading sports players wait until the trade deadline.

184
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,391
Rym: well you want to settle late too because it's all like.

185
00:13:36,431 --> 00:13:46,996
Rym: bringing the jury in is actually the moment when a lot of people suddenly decide they want to settle because suddenly they go from I could win this case to Looking at a bunch of random ass people who couldn't get out of jury duty

186
00:13:47,017 --> 00:13:51,860
Scott: and think well That's some that's something that they actually tell you in jury duty in the waiting room.

187
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,624
Scott: Right, is there?

188
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:59,580
Scott: like as they're like look, you know you sit on this jury There's someone else over there with some legal battle, right?

189
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,839
Scott: And just the fact that you are present in waiting here is like pressure on them.

190
00:14:06,422 --> 00:14:10,000
Scott: Right to you know, have justice be served, right?

191
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:21,840
Scott: So even if you don't do anything and you're just sitting in a waiting room playing on your phone Right just being there the fact that you were there is Moving things along in the judicial system.

192
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:32,013
Rym: Yes and our society our judicial system is designed to try to encourage that outcome the idea being Courts are one of the last resorts in resolving conflicts.

193
00:14:32,073 --> 00:14:34,260
Rym: adults should be able to resolve conflicts amongst themselves.

194
00:14:34,865 --> 00:14:36,789
Rym: If they can't especially civil matters Yeah.

195
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:41,914
Rym: if they can't you arbitrate in some way and you go to a court if you cannot get redress.

196
00:14:42,355 --> 00:14:48,905
Scott: and then because because courts are you Know costly not just to the people involved in the case But to all of our society.

197
00:14:48,966 --> 00:14:50,371
Scott: every time there has to be a trial.

198
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:54,920
Scott: It's like it costs everybody time and money Yep, so Fox admitted that they lied.

199
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:05,911
Rym: They admitted that they're the fascist lying Network pretty much directly and they agreed to pay seven hundred and eighty seven point five Million dollars to Dominion voting systems to make this go away.

200
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,375
Scott: good, but too bad.

201
00:15:07,415 --> 00:15:12,212
Scott: That's not enough money to shut them down Yep, it's basically pocket change to Fox.

202
00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:14,120
Rym: They have like four billion in cash.

203
00:15:14,722 --> 00:15:17,691
Scott: What stupid Murdoch evil guy worth terrifying amounts.

204
00:15:17,711 --> 00:15:22,227
Rym: but Fox by itself has four billion in cash Because they've been buying back.

205
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:23,914
Rym: He's work 18.

206
00:15:23,914 --> 00:15:26,630
Scott: He's well, it says he's worth 17.6 billion.

207
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:43,966
Scott: I don't know if that's down Yeah Or if it's updated but the point is if I lost an equivalent amount of my fortune to a lawsuit that wouldn't affect my life at all percentage wise if I lost 1/18 or 1/17 of my money Notice?

208
00:15:44,006 --> 00:15:50,046
Scott: yeah, if you got $17 18 dollars and then you lose a dollar I Mean how how big of a difference?

209
00:15:50,086 --> 00:15:53,720
Scott: Yeah, really, you know, I guess if that's all you've got then that's really big.

210
00:15:54,962 --> 00:16:01,993
Scott: it's like he could lose 16 billion and he'd still have a billion and Live the same life of infinite luxury, right?

211
00:16:02,516 --> 00:16:03,320
Rym: So it's a big deal.

212
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,994
Rym: It doesn't destroy Fox News, but it's a big deal because we've never had a defamation case like this.

213
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:09,017
Rym: settle for such a.

214
00:16:09,037 --> 00:16:11,613
Scott: we just need 20 more of these.

215
00:16:11,633 --> 00:16:16,209
Rym: well Fun news is they basically fully admitted.

216
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:19,099
Rym: Oh, yeah, we were we were lying that everything you said is true.

217
00:16:21,042 --> 00:16:37,343
Rym: Dominion is also suing Newsmax in one America which are like if I don't have as much money and also if Fox is the fascist network, those are like Deeper fashion, like those are like is what it is just a word for that Like Fascist like.

218
00:16:37,544 --> 00:16:41,880
Rym: put it underline it and put a little swastika next to it like they're terrifying entities.

219
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:47,080
Rym: So there is also the other voting machine company in America the other big one.

220
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,014
Rym: Anyway, Smartmatic has it almost heard of that one.

221
00:16:50,336 --> 00:16:51,180
Rym: Uh, yeah, guess what?

222
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,002
Scott: I thought I thought it was.

223
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,472
Scott: I remember the one back and then it was d-balled everyone.

224
00:16:54,672 --> 00:16:55,857
Rym: Oh, yeah people that was.

225
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:58,357
Rym: I have low Personal opinions of people anyway.

226
00:16:58,438 --> 00:17:00,791
Rym: Yeah Smartmatic, which guess what?

227
00:17:00,892 --> 00:17:10,611
Rym: I hadn't heard of either Was also defamed pretty much the exact same way by Fox and their lawsuit is still going through the courts right now and getting to the point of a trial.

228
00:17:10,914 --> 00:17:14,854
Rym: they've seen Way more than Fox than Dominion sued for.

229
00:17:14,874 --> 00:17:26,750
Rym: yeah So this is ongoing and this is honestly a pretty big victory for just Democracy and truth like it's pretty good news all around.

230
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,054
Rym: It's a pretty good outcome.

231
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:30,440
Scott: should have invested in voting machine companies.

232
00:17:31,781 --> 00:17:34,849
Scott: No, I've invested a billion dollars for doing nothing.

233
00:17:34,869 --> 00:17:36,052
Rym: yeah, I have.

234
00:17:36,193 --> 00:17:38,760
Rym: I have invested more in defense contractors lately.

235
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:40,399
Scott: Okay.

236
00:17:42,205 --> 00:17:43,157
Rym: So I got any news.

237
00:17:44,924 --> 00:17:45,954
Scott: Do we have a news?

238
00:17:46,055 --> 00:17:46,479
Rym: I don't know.

239
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:47,725
Rym: That's fine.

240
00:17:47,786 --> 00:17:58,706
Rym: Cuz we're trying to do the show quickly before hockey so we can just go right into the wings of the day.

241
00:17:58,726 --> 00:18:06,089
Rym: so algorithmic duration of Feeds is definitely just getting worse for a lot of reasons and we don't really need to dwell on that.

242
00:18:06,189 --> 00:18:18,184
Rym: but the algo Just recommended to be a video and YouTube that I just happened to watch because it was short and it was animated and it's called Clown room and it was actually better than it's.

243
00:18:18,786 --> 00:18:19,971
Rym: it's actually scary It's.

244
00:18:20,152 --> 00:18:21,279
Rym: it's a so clown.

245
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:23,110
Scott: so people who are clown averse should not lie.

246
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:29,190
Rym: Oh if you are if you are clown averse if you're not down with that classy like do not watch down with the clown.

247
00:18:29,885 --> 00:18:40,350
Rym: but clown room is a short Animated films a couple minutes long and it's basically about a guy who is being trained to work at some fast-food restaurant.

248
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,770
Rym: And I was like, here's how the fireworks and it's pretty straightforward.

249
00:18:43,431 --> 00:18:48,014
Rym: And then the guys like oh, yeah, there's one last thing probably that this is that this is the room you're gonna interact with the most.

250
00:18:48,315 --> 00:18:58,543
Rym: and he opens the door to the clown room and there's just a clown like tied to a machine and It just proceeds from there and I'm just gonna leave it at that.

251
00:18:58,603 --> 00:18:59,046
Rym: It's it's.

252
00:18:59,166 --> 00:18:59,749
Rym: it's pretty good.

253
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,574
Scott: Write it down next.

254
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:02,276
Scott: next third.

255
00:19:02,316 --> 00:19:03,078
Scott: Well next Thursday.

256
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:04,763
Scott: It's not a book club clowns.

257
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,830
Scott: Do we do clowns clowns?

258
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,182
Rym: I don't know if we've done a show on clowns.

259
00:19:08,222 --> 00:19:08,848
Rym: I'll figure that out.

260
00:19:09,912 --> 00:19:10,699
Scott: It's cloud around.

261
00:19:10,861 --> 00:19:11,709
Rym: Yeah, so what do you got?

262
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:13,413
Scott: What do I have?

263
00:19:13,473 --> 00:19:17,050
Scott: so I don't know a hundred percent that this is real, right?

264
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:21,210
Scott: But it was shared a whole bunch on the internet last week and it seems real.

265
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:22,674
Scott: So I'm just gonna go with it.

266
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,360
Scott: And if it's not real it's like.

267
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,025
Scott: well congrats to whoever wrote this.

268
00:19:26,506 --> 00:19:27,610
Scott: good job writing, right?

269
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:40,260
Scott: So if you if you don't know somehow You know Yuri Gagarin the first human being to ever leave the surface of the earth and be in the cold Defying vacuum of space and then return

270
00:19:40,401 --> 00:19:43,996
Rym: where we were told that it is cold Yes,

271
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:49,130
Scott: the first person ever to do that You know inarguably.

272
00:19:52,092 --> 00:19:54,789
Scott: Before he went up into space, right?

273
00:19:54,970 --> 00:20:00,386
Scott: He wrote a letter to his family because you know, he knew he could very easily die.

274
00:20:00,406 --> 00:20:04,567
Scott: It was super dangerous And no one had done it before.

275
00:20:04,587 --> 00:20:09,890
Scott: and You know much like we talked about unlike our archiving data show, right?

276
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:14,522
Scott: It's like, you know, his family didn't have thankfully didn't have to read that that letter.

277
00:20:14,543 --> 00:20:20,476
Scott: He died in a plane crash way later, but But he didn't die when he went to outer space.

278
00:20:20,697 --> 00:20:27,029
Scott: so but the letter was if it's real was saved And is now available for anyone to read.

279
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,615
Scott: And it's quite a thing to read.

280
00:20:29,836 --> 00:20:44,714
Scott: write a letter from a person who you know is basically still young has a family Yeah is going to do something even riskier than like, you know, Evil Knievel's or any pretty much anything Flying bomb

281
00:20:45,116 --> 00:20:47,484
Rym: something that is both deeply tied

282
00:20:47,504 --> 00:20:49,651
Scott: to a place with no air But

283
00:20:49,711 --> 00:21:06,007
Rym: also tied to a growing military industrial first world second world bloc cold war where there's a lot of political stakes involved and it's complex a complicated situation and is Directly advancing some of the most important long-term science that humans have ever endeavored into.

284
00:21:06,027 --> 00:21:07,113
Scott: yeah He wasn't.

285
00:21:07,254 --> 00:21:08,444
Scott: he wasn't too concerned with that part.

286
00:21:08,706 --> 00:21:10,795
Rym: Yes Actually, he was dude.

287
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:12,642
Rym: I learned a lot about him on the letter.

288
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:14,629
Rym: No, not in the letter, but in his life.

289
00:21:15,951 --> 00:21:19,200
Scott: Yeah, but I mean he was you know, he was basically like pro-communism right?

290
00:21:19,221 --> 00:21:20,143
Scott: He was a communist dude.

291
00:21:20,183 --> 00:21:20,524
Scott: He wasn't.

292
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:21,728
Rym: he was he.

293
00:21:23,511 --> 00:21:29,190
Rym: If you're ever learning you should read the story of him and the other people he worked with and what went on in that program.

294
00:21:30,074 --> 00:21:33,349
Rym: He was not exactly fully on board with the way that was run.

295
00:21:35,031 --> 00:21:44,490
Scott: Anyway, you should read, you know, if you ever have to do something like this You can you can crib crib notes from this letter and that's an AI generator.

296
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:50,090
Rym: I was about to say future humans are just gonna GPT-5 their living will and testament and their letter to their family.

297
00:21:50,672 --> 00:21:56,970
Rym: Someone's gonna make an app of if I die write a letter to my family that I would have written before I died the end.

298
00:21:58,154 --> 00:22:04,644
Scott: I wonder if I can get it to write Heartfelt sentimental things that like work and use them and get away with it.

299
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:06,790
Rym: I'm pretty sure you could.

300
00:22:07,554 --> 00:22:13,624
Rym: I've been thinking a lot about how I could probably Literally train a model on the emails I send and receive.

301
00:22:13,905 --> 00:22:17,284
Rym: that would write the emails I send and receive for me without me even seeing them.

302
00:22:17,626 --> 00:22:22,043
Rym: that would accomplish Basically the same amount that my current emails accomplished today.

303
00:22:22,063 --> 00:22:23,849
Scott: All right, we've done a show on that.

304
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:30,384
Rym: Yep All right in the meta moment GeekNights book club book Which Scott just returned to the library and I should be done with by the next Thursday.

305
00:22:30,424 --> 00:22:33,797
Rym: show the satanic verses Some magical realism.

306
00:22:33,897 --> 00:22:34,379
Scott: you want it.

307
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:37,310
Scott: you want to hear the verses that Satan has to impart upon you.

308
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:42,964
Scott: I mean those seem like pretty, you know, whether you're pro or anti-satan It seems like you would want to know what those verses.

309
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,417
Rym: if you're from Satan You don't want to know what he's got to say.

310
00:22:45,437 --> 00:22:47,085
Rym: If you're anti-satan, you got to know your enemy.

311
00:22:47,748 --> 00:22:48,130
Scott: That's right.

312
00:22:48,411 --> 00:22:48,833
Scott: I think so.

313
00:22:48,893 --> 00:22:50,599
Scott: I think everyone, you know, there's really.

314
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:53,550
Scott: only you can either be even if you're neutral on Satan, right?

315
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:56,166
Scott: It's like well, you know, give them give them a chance.

316
00:22:56,186 --> 00:22:59,190
Rym: I hate to say it though You just made an argument that you should watch some Fox News.

317
00:23:00,771 --> 00:23:02,240
Rym: No, you kind of just did know you're.

318
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,849
Rym: why do you should know what your enemies got to say?

319
00:23:06,832 --> 00:23:16,350
Scott: No, if your enemy is important like Satan telling Not lying Yeah, you should read this book.

320
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:16,752
Rym: I like it.

321
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:22,496
Rym: we keep saying if you have never read this book and you only know about it from his geopolitical context That was me last month.

322
00:23:22,536 --> 00:23:22,736
Scott: Yep.

323
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:26,630
Rym: I think you will just be surprised by what the words are in this book.

324
00:23:28,131 --> 00:23:29,477
Rym: You will be very sad.

325
00:23:29,497 --> 00:23:32,630
Scott: I had absolutely no clue what the words would be in this book until I read it.

326
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,619
Scott: I think you know now I know all the words.

327
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:40,683
Rym: I still think you will be most surprised by Like literally just the first chapter by itself.

328
00:23:40,703 --> 00:23:48,194
Rym: You'll be like wait this This is Let's get right into it.

329
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:49,721
Rym: can't believe never done a show on this.

330
00:23:49,801 --> 00:23:55,861
Rym: when I was a little kid like a like a little kid I was like many kids really into a few things.

331
00:23:55,921 --> 00:23:56,985
Rym: I was really into trains.

332
00:23:57,326 --> 00:23:58,610
Rym: He's really into dinosaurs.

333
00:23:59,191 --> 00:24:04,506
Rym: I was really into space stuff and I was really into magic and illusions.

334
00:24:05,047 --> 00:24:11,330
Scott: Yeah, I mean I wasn't like Really into it or like I was you know, like thinking about it all the time.

335
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:15,664
Rym: I had all those terrible like do a magic show kids as a kid.

336
00:24:15,945 --> 00:24:17,350
Scott: I had one I had a Blackstone one.

337
00:24:17,893 --> 00:24:19,423
Rym: I had the same Blackstone one, I think.

338
00:24:20,128 --> 00:24:20,389
Scott: maybe.

339
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:22,417
Scott: But yeah, it's like.

340
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:28,870
Scott: but if there was a magic Back in the days of television there would be these magic specials on television, right?

341
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:33,005
Scott: There would be like an hour long or more of like an ultra famous magician.

342
00:24:33,025 --> 00:24:37,948
Scott: Yeah, Lee David Copperfield Those two occasionally someone else.

343
00:24:38,632 --> 00:24:43,790
Rym: I have a such a strong memory of David Copperfield doing his flying illusion like for the first time on broadcast TV.

344
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:48,671
Scott: I saw him do it and I saw him do it live and I was trying to figure out what that I never saw him Live.

345
00:24:49,073 --> 00:24:50,699
Scott: I saw him live in Connecticut.

346
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,425
Scott: So but anyway, he's still got him.

347
00:24:52,846 --> 00:24:53,950
Scott: He flew around the audience.

348
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:57,810
Scott: He was he was vertically above the people who were sitting.

349
00:24:59,012 --> 00:25:01,141
Scott: He wasn't just on the stage going through hoops.

350
00:25:01,443 --> 00:25:02,970
Scott: So something was going on.

351
00:25:03,531 --> 00:25:08,828
Scott: Anyway, the point is is that when there was magic on it was like, ooh, I was excited right there was.

352
00:25:08,948 --> 00:25:22,450
Scott: even if there was like, you know a magician at a birthday party or something like that like I was into it right and You know, I was trying to figure out like how the fuck they did that right knew that it clearly wasn't real magic, right?

353
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,569
Scott: Yeah, even though I was still believing in like aliens and other bullshit at that.

354
00:25:27,972 --> 00:25:32,150
Scott: But I'd somehow knew magic was fake and I was always trying to figure out what the trick was.

355
00:25:32,351 --> 00:25:35,709
Scott: And I guess when I was young, I just usually was not able to figure it out.

356
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:48,910
Rym: yeah, I have a I have this very distinct memory of because I also enjoy really low rent magic like the Bottom-tier magician doing like a six-year-olds birthday party like I enjoy watching that or watching do a good job at that.

357
00:25:48,990 --> 00:26:01,510
Rym: Yeah, but I remember I was out of the Cub Scouts, but my little brother was still in the Cub Scouts but he was like a wee blows like about to get out of Cubs like Graduating off and They're doing a magic show for like all the Cub Scouts.

358
00:26:01,691 --> 00:26:06,820
Rym: So it's a little aimed at an audience a little younger than my brother And of course, I'm at that age of.

359
00:26:07,021 --> 00:26:08,630
Rym: I am too cool for fucking everything.

360
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:11,601
Rym: So I'm sitting there watching this magic show and my brother's watching it.

361
00:26:11,641 --> 00:26:20,830
Rym: all these Cub Scouts are watching it and the whole time It's obvious that like the the rabbit placards are just like spinning around or something in those cylinders.

362
00:26:21,251 --> 00:26:25,446
Rym: So it's very clear that he's changing the color of them by just rotating the face in some way.

363
00:26:25,948 --> 00:26:30,037
Rym: I know that trick but It was obvious to the kids too.

364
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:33,389
Rym: and the little kids start yelling like no turn that around hand that to me.

365
00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:39,207
Rym: right now The kids are going so agro against this harried like 40 something year old magician.

366
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:40,130
Rym: Just trying to entertain.

367
00:26:41,013 --> 00:26:44,889
Rym: So finally the magician is like, oh you want to see it?

368
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:50,750
Rym: All right, and he hands it to the kids and fucking nothing that there's nothing in that object.

369
00:26:51,395 --> 00:26:59,490
Rym: He had clearly Been making it look like it was a simple trick and it was a more complex trick to get the kids to react.

370
00:26:59,812 --> 00:27:01,080
Rym: It was so staged.

371
00:27:01,462 --> 00:27:02,790
Rym: I wasn't stunned by the magic trick.

372
00:27:03,111 --> 00:27:09,647
Rym: I was stunned by how he fucking played that entire audience and put that hard to play a bunch of kids But still yeah.

373
00:27:10,452 --> 00:27:20,369
Rym: But like an older audience like you wouldn't antagonize someone who looks like they're a haggard like 40 year old doing magic to try to Get by but he knew the kids would and that was part of his act.

374
00:27:21,756 --> 00:27:22,461
Scott: Mmm, I like it.

375
00:27:22,743 --> 00:27:23,146
Scott: I like it.

376
00:27:23,307 --> 00:27:24,954
Rym: It's Day.

377
00:27:24,994 --> 00:27:30,954
Scott: for that reason I got you know, a lot of the magic that I experienced in person other than you know, David Copperfield.

378
00:27:31,075 --> 00:27:46,590
Scott: Yeah, I was in the mall one time and There was like some event in the mall where basically it was sort of like a trade show I guess and like there were people who basically had set up things to sell themselves right in the hallway of the mall, right?

379
00:27:47,152 --> 00:27:56,290
Scott: So one one of the things in the mall was this magician who had set up like a whole like a little mini stage in The hallway in the mall like near one of the entrances where there's a lot of space, right?

380
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:04,886
Scott: And he's doing like magic shows on the hour like a couple tricks each with an assistant And he's trying to get you to hire him for your parties bar mitzvahs, etc.

381
00:28:04,967 --> 00:28:06,513
Rym: Not a bad ad Right.

382
00:28:06,734 --> 00:28:11,572
Scott: So this is the one time in my life where I'm like, I don't know how old I was Fucking.

383
00:28:11,612 --> 00:28:13,682
Scott: no, right and you know, he's like.

384
00:28:13,702 --> 00:28:15,450
Scott: he's like I need a volunteer from the audience.

385
00:28:15,732 --> 00:28:17,286
Scott: My arm is coming out of my socket.

386
00:28:17,407 --> 00:28:20,996
Scott: I'm like And I actually got picked.

387
00:28:21,096 --> 00:28:21,819
Scott: Oh damn, right?

388
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,030
Scott: And so now now I knew I'm like, this is my chance, right?

389
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,922
Scott: I'm like, I know that he didn't pick a stooge from the crowd.

390
00:28:28,524 --> 00:28:29,910
Scott: It's really it's me, right?

391
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,157
Scott: I can't you know, I'm gonna figure out.

392
00:28:32,197 --> 00:28:35,609
Scott: I'm just gonna pay really close attention to what the fuck is going on, right.

393
00:28:35,629 --> 00:28:39,190
Scott: and You know try to figure out what the hell is happening here, right?

394
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:46,269
Scott: And it was the old trick where like you stuff one handkerchief in my hand and then like a fuck ton of hate rainbow Handkerchief shit comes out, right?

395
00:28:47,313 --> 00:28:48,790
Scott: It was that one, right?

396
00:28:49,432 --> 00:28:56,869
Scott: So, you know, he's the thing is I'm paying so much attention Like what he's doing and try to figure it out that I wasn't paying attention to his instructions, really.

397
00:28:59,813 --> 00:29:05,705
Scott: So he stuffs like the handkerchief in my hand All right, and he was doing like a practice countdown of like.

398
00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:06,810
Scott: this is how we're gonna do it.

399
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:12,587
Scott: You're gonna count down one, two, three and then reveal right but on the practice countdown.

400
00:29:12,607 --> 00:29:18,199
Scott: I Revealed right And but sure enough there was a fuck ton of hate.

401
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,870
Scott: it like, you know, he had done the magic already, right?

402
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:28,985
Scott: It's like basically, you know when he was stuffing the single handkerchief in my hand He additionally stuffed many more in there, right?

403
00:29:29,206 --> 00:29:30,110
Scott: My hand was closed.

404
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:32,849
Scott: I was trying to look at what he was doing with his hand, you know.

405
00:29:33,211 --> 00:29:38,768
Scott: But all I I guess the only thing I had to go on was I could feel that There's a lot more on my hand than that one handkerchief.

406
00:29:41,652 --> 00:29:56,145
Scott: And that was you know, a pretty simple trick but I just remember like messing it up for that guy Even though it wasn't a total mess-up because like the magic happened But it was a slight mess-up because he had to be like, oh hey, you know yet.

407
00:29:56,165 --> 00:30:00,736
Scott: He was off his you know You know presentation game.

408
00:30:00,756 --> 00:30:03,425
Rym: Yeah, the what's the last music show?

409
00:30:03,506 --> 00:30:04,128
Rym: I listen music.

410
00:30:04,168 --> 00:30:06,580
Rym: last magic show I saw was at my brother's wedding.

411
00:30:06,601 --> 00:30:07,928
Rym: We were in Vegas because that's where it was.

412
00:30:07,948 --> 00:30:10,688
Rym: and Of course, why not go see Penn and Teller like it?

413
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:14,110
Scott: I mean, I feel like if you go to V everyone who goes to Vegas goes to see that right?

414
00:30:14,371 --> 00:30:15,657
Scott: They've been there hundred years.

415
00:30:15,677 --> 00:30:16,259
Rym: Yeah, they're not.

416
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,570
Scott: they're not there a hundred years because they're not selling.

417
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:21,290
Scott: Yeah, you keep selling out, but I got it They.

418
00:30:21,411 --> 00:30:23,035
Rym: they perform in a hole.

419
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:29,835
Rym: they perform in the Rio which isn't even on the main strip and it smells like Sadness in there.

420
00:30:29,956 --> 00:30:30,659
Rym: It is the word.

421
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:31,844
Scott: I feel like that's what they there.

422
00:30:31,925 --> 00:30:32,688
Scott: That's their style.

423
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:38,598
Scott: Yeah No, I wouldn't what they wouldn't want to perform and like the MSG Perfect venue for them.

424
00:30:38,618 --> 00:30:46,870
Rym: because you walk into this place you look around like wow This is a place that Penn Jillette would like go to feel sad on purpose and because that is how it fuels his soul.

425
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:56,159
Rym: but Seeing them live even from a crappy seat was just fucking phenomenal Like even in the nosebleed seat in the top of this arena.

426
00:30:56,179 --> 00:31:01,889
Rym: you think that far away in a Vegas show where they're doing the same Show they've done like five times a day for years.

427
00:31:02,832 --> 00:31:06,095
Scott: Change it now and then mix up the tricks a little bit But anyway half the tricks.

428
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:06,436
Rym: for once.

429
00:31:06,516 --> 00:31:14,669
Rym: I had seen Penn and Teller perform before on TV or in specials But you know what still amazing like even knowing everything I knew about them.

430
00:31:15,591 --> 00:31:19,249
Rym: No way to tell like you can't figure out you can't see the moment where they did the thing.

431
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:22,161
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, I have guesses for some of the.

432
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:24,070
Scott: you know some tricks, you know some tricks.

433
00:31:24,271 --> 00:31:27,706
Scott: It's like you can guess right and I have some idea but like the specific.

434
00:31:27,726 --> 00:31:38,140
Scott: and the thing is The specifics of a lot of those things are just so elaborate that like you could never in a million years That's what that's when they cuz you know We talked about got the history at least of us enjoying magicians.

435
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:49,258
Rym: when I was young when we were watching like David Copperfield there was this pop culture idea that magicians are this very closed group of people with Secrets and like you never kind of are.

436
00:31:49,459 --> 00:31:51,686
Rym: they kind are but not because a lot.

437
00:31:51,746 --> 00:31:56,203
Scott: the reason they are though I think nowadays isn't you know, it's like there's an internet.

438
00:31:56,244 --> 00:31:57,790
Scott: right people know things, right?

439
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:58,574
Scott: People can slow it up.

440
00:31:58,594 --> 00:32:02,010
Scott: people have a high-resolution video now they can slow it down everything, right?

441
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:13,010
Scott: But I think the reason magicians are still secretive is because a lot of them don't make their money Performing a lot of them make their money developing and then selling tricks, right?

442
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:23,164
Scott: So if everyone in the whole world knows how to do the trick You know the illusion that you figured out and then developed and you know You but you maybe had to build equipment for or patent a thing, right?

443
00:32:23,204 --> 00:32:28,870
Scott: It's like if everyone knows You can't make any money selling the trick to other magicians, right?

444
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:39,870
Scott: It's like there's a lot of magicians out there who are very good because they're highly talented in the realms of you know performance Practicing execution style storytelling etc, right?

445
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:54,610
Scott: But they're not people who can like develop a brand new trick Maybe one right or do it remix an existing trick a little bit and they go to other Magicians who have developed who are you know experts at developing tons of tricks and they buy tricks from them.

446
00:32:54,991 --> 00:32:59,545
Scott: They follow the instructions and they practice it a thousand times and develop an act around it.

447
00:32:59,805 --> 00:33:01,330
Scott: and that's how the business model goes.

448
00:33:01,456 --> 00:33:03,236
Scott: No So that's why the secrets can't go out.

449
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:09,993
Scott: if I buy a tricks with someone and reveal the secret and then ruin their business Hey, I'm not gonna get any more tricks from them, which hurts me Especially.

450
00:33:10,033 --> 00:33:13,087
Scott: if they're good at it and be they're gonna be super pissed.

451
00:33:13,107 --> 00:33:13,750
Scott: They could sue me.

452
00:33:14,072 --> 00:33:14,294
Scott: It's like.

453
00:33:14,537 --> 00:33:15,890
Scott: that's what's keeping the secret.

454
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,334
Rym: but there was also trying.

455
00:33:17,354 --> 00:33:25,843
Rym: there was a pop culture thing that was part of making magicians popular of the mystique of like Never ever reveal a magician secret.

456
00:33:25,944 --> 00:33:28,274
Rym: because remember when there was that That's still yet.

457
00:33:28,334 --> 00:33:32,347
Rym: It's that pop culture attempt to do the the mass magician and his whole shtick.

458
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:33,555
Rym: This is what the 90s I saw.

459
00:33:33,575 --> 00:33:34,510
Scott: I remember that he was like.

460
00:33:34,651 --> 00:33:38,594
Rym: I'm gonna show you how like all the big tricks are done one by one and They'll like.

461
00:33:38,635 --> 00:33:41,171
Rym: they'll come after me if they find out who I am Like.

462
00:33:41,312 --> 00:33:43,198
Rym: I'm in danger from the other magicians.

463
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:44,081
Rym: and then pendula.

464
00:33:44,101 --> 00:33:50,089
Rym: it was like yeah now really that's funny though It's a good shtick but pendulum Penn and Teller were the ones who?

465
00:33:50,971 --> 00:33:56,401
Rym: Made an alternate pop culture idea because they were the ones who were like, yeah We're gonna start showing how we do our tricks cuz you know what.

466
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:57,989
Rym: we can tell you how we're gonna do it.

467
00:33:58,392 --> 00:33:59,781
Rym: We can show you how we're gonna do it.

468
00:33:59,801 --> 00:34:01,089
Rym: You still won't fucking see us do it.

469
00:34:02,271 --> 00:34:12,783
Scott: Well, I mean there's a. there's a particular genre of trick now that I've seen several magicians do where you have a trick and part Of the routine is to reveal how part of the trick was done

470
00:34:12,822 --> 00:34:21,168
Rym: and tell her made that famous when they did the trick of With the little hands and the hankerchiefs in the box and then they did it with the clear wall so you could see that the trick is just.

471
00:34:22,091 --> 00:34:29,290
Rym: Teller is Destroying his body and working extremely hard crawling around in this insane contraption the entire time.

472
00:34:30,331 --> 00:34:32,458
Scott: But then this but then there's an additional trick.

473
00:34:32,498 --> 00:34:34,907
Scott: Yeah that goes above and beyond right.

474
00:34:35,168 --> 00:34:37,329
Scott: that is like Oh, you showed me how you did that.

475
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:39,860
Scott: But then it's like how did you do that extra part at the end?

476
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,406
Scott: I'll fucking know right.

477
00:34:41,987 --> 00:34:48,210
Scott: Oh, yeah Yeah, you know magic is a is a you know, it's a fun entertaining kind of performance art.

478
00:34:48,351 --> 00:34:49,156
Scott: I enjoy it a lot.

479
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,449
Scott: I risk, you know, I used to when I was a kid.

480
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:54,339
Scott: I enjoy it because you know the mystery.

481
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,623
Scott: how the fuck did they do that?

482
00:34:55,643 --> 00:35:02,490
Scott: Right and nowadays it's more like You know the respect like wow, look at you know, they they they figured that out, right?

483
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,000
Scott: It's like they practice that so much.

484
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:05,107
Scott: they you know, etc, etc.

485
00:35:06,713 --> 00:35:09,470
Scott: They got skills, you know, especially card people.

486
00:35:09,611 --> 00:35:13,670
Scott: It's like they're like it's like there's some card people and it's like how did he do that?

487
00:35:14,051 --> 00:35:18,190
Scott: The dude just has the ability to pull out the card he wants out of a deck of it.

488
00:35:18,331 --> 00:35:21,370
Rym: You choose basically a thief from Dungeons & Dragons like you just got right.

489
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,093
Scott: It's like you can.

490
00:35:22,154 --> 00:35:29,303
Scott: you can hand him a deck of 52 cards and say take the 14th card from the bottom out and don't touch any other cards and boop.

491
00:35:29,343 --> 00:35:31,731
Scott: they could just do it right even though cards are really Thin.

492
00:35:31,811 --> 00:35:40,410
Scott: yeah, it's like they just have practiced that skill of manipulating pieces of paper in a stack really really Adeptly and it's like that's fucking amazing.

493
00:35:40,591 --> 00:35:47,961
Scott: If I try to do that the cards just spill all over and I've been shuffling cards since I was three because I'm gonna I'm gonna join one of the Euchre meetups that we're.

494
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:49,869
Rym: that we had you discovered a while ago.

495
00:35:49,909 --> 00:35:58,668
Rym: here I was practicing something I haven't done in years many many years of Top and bottom dealing and like basically card cheating tricking just to see if I can still do it.

496
00:35:59,372 --> 00:36:00,909
Rym: I can still I can still kind of do it.

497
00:36:01,231 --> 00:36:01,552
Rym: I can.

498
00:36:02,054 --> 00:36:05,930
Rym: I can choose a couple of cards that I'm dealing out and get away with it.

499
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:12,139
Rym: I think if I really want to with a standard deck of cards Like a lot of the times card magic right.

500
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:12,340
Scott: the.

501
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,110
Scott: the answer of how did they do that is they're just that good.

502
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:15,874
Scott: Yeah, it wasn't it.

503
00:36:15,894 --> 00:36:17,501
Scott: There's not any trick to it or anything.

504
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:20,856
Scott: It's like they're just that good at Handling cards.

505
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:24,257
Scott: they could remember where a card is Retrieve that card.

506
00:36:24,438 --> 00:36:26,267
Scott: they can memorize the order of the whole deck.

507
00:36:26,307 --> 00:36:29,970
Scott: they can do also You know because they just practiced so much out that they can do that.

508
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:33,303
Rym: I broadly break the naive lead it not even the definition of.

509
00:36:33,404 --> 00:36:39,984
Rym: I am NOT a magician who has any expertise But in terms of as a as a person who watches magicians I kind of break them up into.

510
00:36:40,005 --> 00:36:48,821
Rym: there's magicians who do tricks like there's a prop or a Special device that they use to facilitate the trick like David Copperfield flying.

511
00:36:49,243 --> 00:36:51,630
Rym: There's a special device like some mechanism.

512
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,440
Scott: There's got to be something or he's magic.

513
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,475
Scott: I Don't think he's right.

514
00:36:56,636 --> 00:36:57,360
Rym: Yeah, if he was magic.

515
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,590
Scott: I don't think I know it wasn't a jetpack, right?

516
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:03,370
Scott: But clearly he always does it in a floaty loose shirt.

517
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:06,350
Scott: So he's got some kind of harness and definitely just harnessing dark wires.

518
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:12,108
Scott: But I looked but I when I was there in person right and it's like he's on stage and he's flying right.

519
00:37:12,168 --> 00:37:16,530
Scott: it's like okay Well, there could be wires there, but he comes forward out of the stage.

520
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:21,230
Scott: He's above people right like, you know, you could look up and there he is, right?

521
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,203
Scott: So it's like are there cables out in the crowd?

522
00:37:23,264 --> 00:37:24,170
Scott: I'm looking for the cables.

523
00:37:24,311 --> 00:37:27,302
Scott: I did not see them if he had like the.

524
00:37:27,824 --> 00:37:29,490
Scott: so I don't know what kind of fishing line.

525
00:37:29,851 --> 00:37:31,117
Scott: But it's like there I was looking.

526
00:37:31,137 --> 00:37:32,082
Scott: there were dark areas.

527
00:37:32,102 --> 00:37:33,790
Scott: There were light areas colored areas.

528
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,700
Scott: I was trying to find any contrast whatsoever.

529
00:37:35,861 --> 00:37:44,890
Rym: according to David Copperfield's patent He is supported by two fan-shaped arrays of fine wires that remained invisible to the audience due to the combination of lighting and thickness.

530
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:46,971
Scott: Okay, but yeah They were.

531
00:37:47,071 --> 00:37:54,438
Rym: truly there is an entire Wikipedia article with diagrams and everything on David Copperfield's flying tricks Specifically.

532
00:37:54,459 --> 00:37:55,349
Scott: there you go.

533
00:37:55,450 --> 00:38:03,662
Scott: But I mean it was really impressive like it was when I was a kid and I didn't have internet to look that up Like I thought it had to be cables cuz what else the fuck could it be?

534
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:04,826
Scott: Yeah, it's not a jetpack.

535
00:38:04,886 --> 00:38:05,830
Scott: It's not magic, right?

536
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:11,070
Scott: That's all that eliminates most of the options, but you could not see the cables anywhere, right?

537
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:12,857
Scott: How long did it take him to figure that out?

538
00:38:13,379 --> 00:38:13,600
Rym: Yep.

539
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:13,961
Rym: Let's see.

540
00:38:13,981 --> 00:38:14,945
Rym: The wires are about.

541
00:38:14,965 --> 00:38:16,190
Scott: he's someone he didn't buy that.

542
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,797
Scott: I can see why he figured that out.

543
00:38:17,858 --> 00:38:21,866
Rym: The wires are point to five millimeters thick

544
00:38:23,031 --> 00:38:36,510
Scott: Yeah, but I mean the point is is that unlike other magicians who might buy a trick David Copperfield invented that and performed it Right, so he's whether you know as a person, you know, who knows but I guess he's a weird guy.

545
00:38:36,811 --> 00:38:47,503
Scott: I'm sure you can be is can be validly criticized, but he is a talented individual for sure Yeah, but that is like one genre or type or component of tricks, you know the prop.

546
00:38:47,924 --> 00:38:52,270
Rym: then there's the insane effort Angle, which is often a Penn & Teller trick.

547
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,749
Scott: We're now you can also combine the two.

548
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,115
Rym: Yeah They're more like components.

549
00:38:55,155 --> 00:38:57,786
Rym: like you could have a trick that incorporates both of those and that.

550
00:38:57,806 --> 00:39:08,248
Rym: but then there's Close-up magic, which I didn't really realize was this own genre until we started listening to Penn Radio And he talked a lot about like his card trick friends and close-up magic.

551
00:39:08,308 --> 00:39:08,730
Scott: and right.

552
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:15,009
Scott: well I think the difference between the thing about close-up magic and I personally put a lot more value on close-up magic then.

553
00:39:15,611 --> 00:39:17,960
Scott: Not you know not to say the stage magic is no good, right?

554
00:39:18,261 --> 00:39:20,730
Scott: But with stage magic, there's two things, right?

555
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:35,850
Scott: One is that the audience the distance between the audience and the illusion is bigger Which means it's easier to hide things right because you know The audience doesn't have like a close-up view right with their eyes or ears or other senses.

556
00:39:36,011 --> 00:39:38,230
Scott: You know that there's smell or whatever it is, right?

557
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:54,568
Scott: and so, you know you you don't have to be as as Quicker as clever to hide something because there's so much space right if you just you could do something where the audience isn't looking Like on the complete other side of the stage behind it behind a prop behind a big wall or a mirror or right?

558
00:39:55,691 --> 00:40:02,490
Scott: And the second thing is that with stage magic you the magician illusionist has complete control of the environment.

559
00:40:03,012 --> 00:40:04,276
Scott: Right, they control.

560
00:40:04,296 --> 00:40:08,790
Scott: the entire space is like pre-prepared right for them.

561
00:40:09,111 --> 00:40:17,144
Scott: You know, they did all kinds of stuff before you got in the room and that makes it You know takes away some of the magic even though there isn't any magic to begin with.

562
00:40:17,786 --> 00:40:27,460
Scott: a close-up magician Right can perform the tricks right anywhere a crowded bar on empty on the street Right on the street.

563
00:40:27,581 --> 00:40:28,750
Scott: They don't control anything.

564
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:29,332
Scott: It's like we're on.

565
00:40:29,352 --> 00:40:32,502
Scott: there's no way that they could have prepared anything around here.

566
00:40:32,562 --> 00:40:34,809
Scott: if they did that was a herculean effort, right?

567
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:44,190
Scott: so it's like the environment is not controlled by them and Also, usually the equipment might not be controlled by them, right?

568
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,663
Scott: It's like they could say hey go in the drugstore buy me a deck of cards.

569
00:40:46,703 --> 00:40:48,412
Scott: you come out and they do a magic trick With it, right?

570
00:40:48,432 --> 00:40:49,939
Scott: It's like it's a normal deck of cards.

571
00:40:50,441 --> 00:40:54,410
Scott: So it's you know, and you're right next to them Like they're right there, you know.

572
00:40:54,510 --> 00:41:05,270
Scott: If they gonna like you're staring at what the fuck they're doing and so are all your friends cuz they're trying to make a tik-tok Right and they you know, or you're sitting at a table in a bar and everyone's staring at them.

573
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:06,775
Scott: They're the complete center of attention.

574
00:41:06,795 --> 00:41:09,826
Scott: this you know, it's a real table cuz it's the bars table.

575
00:41:09,866 --> 00:41:14,284
Scott: It's not a trapdoor table It's not a. you know, there's nothing weird going on here, right?

576
00:41:14,304 --> 00:41:15,429
Scott: They got their sleeves rolled up.

577
00:41:15,951 --> 00:41:20,585
Scott: Everything is you know, but they still do it somehow and that is the most and that's a more.

578
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,230
Scott: it's a more powerful effect.

579
00:41:22,491 --> 00:41:26,509
Rym: The do a close-up trick been able to partake in close-up magic.

580
00:41:27,231 --> 00:41:34,616
Rym: It is just like it hits you in the gut like you're like staring at the thing and then it disappears and the trick happens And it's like your body just goes.

581
00:41:34,756 --> 00:41:35,539
Rym: what the fuck?

582
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:37,446
Rym: I was looking right at it.

583
00:41:37,567 --> 00:41:38,450
Rym: It was right there.

584
00:41:39,156 --> 00:41:48,529
Scott: I was like, I know you's done it And They're not gonna do it again, yeah, like that's it too bad.

585
00:41:50,112 --> 00:41:51,581
Scott: Come pay me and I'll show you how to do it.

586
00:41:51,802 --> 00:41:53,050
Scott: It's like see thousand.

587
00:41:53,070 --> 00:42:00,130
Rym: Yeah, if you're a rich person doing like a wedding or something I think the pro is move would be to just hire one of those like top tier close-up magicians.

588
00:42:00,492 --> 00:42:04,990
Rym: Just wander around your wedding party doing close-up magic for people That kind of thing.

589
00:42:05,931 --> 00:42:08,530
Scott: Maybe you know, it'd be good at the old people table or they're not dancing.

590
00:42:09,053 --> 00:42:12,610
Scott: I mean, I'd be following that guy around all my kids take or the kids table if there are kids.

591
00:42:14,451 --> 00:42:15,214
Rym: One thing I'd like.

592
00:42:15,294 --> 00:42:18,847
Rym: I'm trying to think of what cuz nowadays most magicians I encounter.

593
00:42:18,887 --> 00:42:20,725
Rym: like I watch their stuff It's usually in a YouTube video.

594
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:25,785
Rym: Covid for a few years definitely was a contributor to that but I can.

595
00:42:25,805 --> 00:42:33,469
Rym: the only magicians I can name Are like a handful of people at pendula talked about a lot and like the magicians that were on TV when I was a kid

596
00:42:34,693 --> 00:42:36,969
Scott: That the ones they saw on YouTube if I could remember their names

597
00:42:37,211 --> 00:42:40,570
Rym: But like I remember Blackstone and Harry Anderson and David

598
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:41,713
Scott: Right.

599
00:42:42,054 --> 00:42:53,110
Scott: So back in the day right when there were TV specials and when a magician could fill a whole, you know Theater a big theater magicians can make a name for themselves, right?

600
00:42:53,250 --> 00:43:00,944
Scott: it's like no, but you know, whereas nowadays you could be the most talented amazing magician and It's you would not be able to reach.

601
00:43:00,964 --> 00:43:04,950
Scott: but you know If someone came around today who was better than David Copperfield, right?

602
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:12,250
Scott: They could not eat in all aspects trick-making, you know performance style at everything personality.

603
00:43:12,936 --> 00:43:19,070
Scott: They could not reach those heights Because there just isn't the the platform, right?

604
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:19,572
Scott: There's no.

605
00:43:19,632 --> 00:43:22,868
Rym: David Blaine was one of the more recent ones who got a wide.

606
00:43:23,009 --> 00:43:24,693
Scott: well It's like.

607
00:43:24,713 --> 00:43:28,570
Scott: David Blaine is very good at Matt, you know close-up magic and things but he's a weird dude.

608
00:43:29,551 --> 00:43:34,470
Scott: Prop he's got he's a really weird dude and a lot of the stuff he did wasn't just so magic II.

609
00:43:34,972 --> 00:43:38,366
Scott: It was more just like, you know, I will survive in this.

610
00:43:38,487 --> 00:43:39,210
Scott: Well, it was cute.

611
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:43,485
Rym: It was more like early magic like what Houdini would do.

612
00:43:43,566 --> 00:43:50,307
Rym: It's more like that Right, but where there's no peril or the oddity or curiosity of it more so than the trick itself.

613
00:43:50,347 --> 00:43:53,037
Scott: like your people It was still right.

614
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:56,090
Scott: It's like yes, he was in peril, but he would usually escape.

615
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,690
Rym: Well, yeah, but it's more that you're looking like you look at it.

616
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:03,870
Rym: One of the David Blaine things like he's just locked in some in a water thing with no obvious way to get air.

617
00:44:04,371 --> 00:44:05,074
Rym: It's still very.

618
00:44:05,214 --> 00:44:15,243
Rym: it's preying on the same thing that I think Houdini did where even if the trick is very well formed and very Safe as an audience member part of the appeal to the masses is wait.

619
00:44:15,604 --> 00:44:16,506
Rym: He could die.

620
00:44:16,526 --> 00:44:27,734
Scott: Whoa Right, but I mean just watching somebody do something where they're just like, you know enduring Suffering and not dying.

621
00:44:27,754 --> 00:44:28,396
Scott: I don't.

622
00:44:28,537 --> 00:44:32,190
Scott: that doesn't really qualify as you know, at least in my book as like.

623
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:34,039
Rym: I think the lines are blurry.

624
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,030
Scott: It's a. it's like an act of endurance, right?

625
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,009
Scott: But if you add you just have to add a little bit to it like, you know?

626
00:44:39,251 --> 00:44:39,913
Scott: Ah, he was.

627
00:44:40,153 --> 00:44:45,009
Scott: he was underwater in a box, but he escaped even though the locks are on the outside.

628
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:45,832
Scott: now There's a magic.

629
00:44:46,012 --> 00:44:57,289
Rym: All right, how about some something that's impossible about in the water cube and you can see him in there with no And he just stays in there for like an hour instead of the three minutes that a human could do.

630
00:44:58,252 --> 00:44:59,982
Scott: Yeah, that's that's a magic one, right?

631
00:45:00,022 --> 00:45:00,485
Scott: Cuz it's like.

632
00:45:00,545 --> 00:45:05,360
Scott: clearly he's What the same way that David Copperfield hid is flying.

633
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:05,680
Scott: yeah, I guess

634
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:21,465
Rym: what I'm saying more is that to me magic like this is a Broad and diffuse genre of entertainment and primarily it's entertainment and it bumps into a lot of other forms of entertainment and It would be very hard to draw the line unless you want to draw the line at.

635
00:45:21,906 --> 00:45:27,410
Rym: is there an illusion Like as the illusionist as opposed to a new vocation is.
