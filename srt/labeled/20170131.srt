1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,676
Rym: It's Tuesday January 31st 2017.

2
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:09,997
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:10,057 --> 00:00:10,699
Rym: That's good.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:17,454
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:17,474 --> 00:00:20,650
Rym: we're talking about potion explosion.

6
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:22,592
Rym: It's okay.

7
00:00:25,858 --> 00:00:26,880
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:33,817
Rym: Good PAX South as always but as I was leaving PAX South I dug the pisser.

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:47,599
Rym: Yeah, one of the crowning achievements of my life is that I was able to start a chant of Good chunk of the audience at the omega-thon finale at PAX and that chant was just piss piss piss.

10
00:00:48,563 --> 00:00:49,366
Rym: Without context.

11
00:00:49,406 --> 00:00:53,220
Scott: that sounds horrible, but what a sad life you had if that's the crowning achievement.

12
00:00:53,361 --> 00:00:53,924
Scott: But the dude.

13
00:00:53,964 --> 00:00:54,587
Rym: so basically what?

14
00:00:54,627 --> 00:00:57,120
Rym: the dude who failed to win the omega-thon last year.

15
00:00:57,502 --> 00:01:00,298
Rym: he just happens to have the handle rug pisser.

16
00:01:00,318 --> 00:01:05,087
Rym: and Because he failed to win the omega-thon finale He gets to be in a mega not again.

17
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:12,079
Rym: and as we've noticed if you make it to the finale and fail You're pretty much gonna keep making it to the finale until you succeed.

18
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,524
Scott: I'm we're trying to figure out.

19
00:01:13,665 --> 00:01:14,247
Scott: is a?

20
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,835
Scott: are people losing in the finale on purpose?

21
00:01:16,895 --> 00:01:20,900
Scott: because just getting the second place Guarantees you to come to the packs and beat omega-naught?

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,092
Rym: Yeah, and then one year if you want to go to Australia just decide to win.

23
00:01:24,313 --> 00:01:25,818
Scott: you win and then but then you're dry.

24
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:27,560
Scott: your days Of omega not are over right?

25
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:34,729
Scott: It's like you can just keep going to the same packs over and over and over and over Remembered more being an omega not over and over.

26
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:38,643
Scott: or you can go to PAX Australia or wherever whatever it packs You want.

27
00:01:38,784 --> 00:01:40,420
Rym: one time Rym won the omega-thon?

28
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:47,285
Rym: 2019 great or Rym was an omega not finale 20 years in a row.

29
00:01:47,305 --> 00:01:54,070
Scott: or is it that there are certain people who practice the games that are announced But then they can't deal?

30
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:59,612
Scott: their natural gaming skill is low so they can't beat the final secret game that they didn't it was like.

31
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:06,693
Rym: remember when Lou when a friend of ours tried to Rig the DDR tournament freshman year at RIT by rigging it.

32
00:02:06,713 --> 00:02:19,195
Rym: There was this there was a gentleman of Distasteful demeanor who was super good at DDR with his fanboy pistoning and He was good at it primarily because he just memorized a hundred percent.

33
00:02:19,778 --> 00:02:30,696
Rym: So The president of the club at the time made the finale of the tournament Custom arrows that no one had ever seen before hoping that someone with raw skills could beat this person.

34
00:02:31,298 --> 00:02:34,540
Rym: Mmm, so It might be a situation like that.

35
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:44,652
Rym: These people do not have raw skills necessarily or at least not a breadth of skills required to be able to make it through all those baby rounds and be good at like crocodile or air hockey or at

36
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:48,582
Scott: least the omega-thon was air Hokey,

37
00:02:48,824 --> 00:02:51,040
Rym: which I guessed every year for so many years.

38
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,220
Scott: We guessed that we wanted that we wanted it to be that and we guessed it would be that for years and years and years.

39
00:02:57,661 --> 00:03:03,420
Scott: And then we completely forgot about it because it was so clear that it was gonna be some Nintendo switch game.

40
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,040
Scott: Not only was packs out the premiere of the Nintendo switch for people to who weren't Nintendo.

41
00:03:10,242 --> 00:03:13,893
Scott: On the stage they had red and blue packs sticks like I'm and it's like it.

42
00:03:14,414 --> 00:03:16,360
Scott: the stage looked like a switch controller.

43
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:18,187
Rym: Remember the year when they set up.

44
00:03:18,228 --> 00:03:22,848
Rym: it looked like there was a pinball machine because they had a drape over it and then they Pulled the drape off and just a pile of shit.

45
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:23,432
Rym: They're like, no.

46
00:03:23,874 --> 00:03:26,107
Scott: Yeah, it was not what you thought It was there.

47
00:03:26,308 --> 00:03:26,992
Scott: It was clever.

48
00:03:27,052 --> 00:03:30,019
Scott: But yeah hockey that's fine.

49
00:03:30,763 --> 00:03:35,400
Rym: The best part about it was that neither one of them was good at air hockey at all.

50
00:03:35,742 --> 00:03:38,940
Scott: They got slightly better at air hockey to make it entertaining rugpister.

51
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:45,800
Rym: However, I love you, dude But you did not exhibit the capacity of learning that Mancey did or maybe he wasn't losing intentionally.

52
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:50,731
Rym: Maybe I mean, I'm gonna say if I got to the Megadon finale Probably lose several years in a row.

53
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:52,180
Rym: cuz I'm pretty sure if you're skilled enough.

54
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,525
Scott: I mean consider this right.

55
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:57,440
Scott: you're up against someone who's also good at games out of packs, right?

56
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,023
Scott: It's a game.

57
00:03:58,044 --> 00:03:58,608
Scott: You don't know.

58
00:03:58,728 --> 00:04:00,320
Scott: unless you get lucky and it's a game.

59
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,511
Scott: You're already the master of right like.

60
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,199
Scott: oh look it happens to be kaboom.

61
00:04:05,183 --> 00:04:05,344
Scott: Right.

62
00:04:05,547 --> 00:04:08,592
Scott: unless that happens You basically got a 50/50 shot.

63
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,014
Scott: So what are the odds of tails three so far for rugpister?

64
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:13,240
Scott: three tails in a row?

65
00:04:13,702 --> 00:04:14,669
Scott: That's that can happen.

66
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:15,413
Rym: counterpoint though.

67
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:20,980
Rym: Oh She's surprising percentage of the games are games that we just happen to be really good at.

68
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:24,360
Scott: We happen to be good at a lot of games and they pick lots of old games.

69
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,580
Scott: Oh, they also pick lots of physical arcade type games that we are fans of.

70
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:31,073
Rym: However, I'd like I'm not good at crocodile like.

71
00:04:31,113 --> 00:04:31,737
Rym: I would add trouble.

72
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:34,986
Rym: No Flicking not great.

73
00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:36,512
Rym: No, I mean pitch cars.

74
00:04:36,592 --> 00:04:40,005
Rym: I did really well, but even in pitch cars I basically have three settings.

75
00:04:40,386 --> 00:04:43,856
Rym: fucking miss entirely don't move at all fly off the table.

76
00:04:44,357 --> 00:04:45,260
Rym: Those are my three settings.

77
00:04:45,381 --> 00:04:48,040
Scott: I mean if it wasn't for that one really hard part we put on the pitch.

78
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:53,290
Scott: It's like I'm really good at the pitch car As long as there isn't something above my skill level.

79
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,580
Scott: like if everything's within my skill level like I'm great.

80
00:04:55,741 --> 00:04:56,906
Scott: It's same thing with like rocket league.

81
00:04:56,926 --> 00:05:01,827
Scott: if we did if we had rocket league where everyone is stuck on the ground and you could Only jump and not rock it up into the air.

82
00:05:01,847 --> 00:05:03,996
Scott: I would be like the god at rocket.

83
00:05:04,036 --> 00:05:04,939
Scott: He's so good, right?

84
00:05:06,141 --> 00:05:07,889
Rym: So, yeah packs happened and we'll talk.

85
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:09,475
Rym: I mean most of the stuff we saw we'll talk about.

86
00:05:09,495 --> 00:05:12,406
Rym: we're not do a whole show on Packs, but cuz we go to.

87
00:05:12,426 --> 00:05:13,350
Rym: a lot of packs is now.

88
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:16,240
Rym: but panel went well saw a bunch of good games.

89
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:18,655
Rym: We'll talk about them as we play them more and review them.

90
00:05:18,755 --> 00:05:19,520
Scott: way too many games.

91
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:22,235
Rym: I think the game that stuck out the most was captain sonar.

92
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:22,356
Rym: like.

93
00:05:22,376 --> 00:05:23,120
Rym: we played it enough.

94
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,347
Rym: That game is a fucking like.

95
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:25,614
Rym: that game is perfect.

96
00:05:25,654 --> 00:05:27,142
Scott: I mean, we know that yeah but new.

97
00:05:27,383 --> 00:05:33,960
Rym: we exposed a lot of people who hadn't actually played it to it and Pretty much everyone just wanted to keep playing it all night.

98
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,336
Rym: We had to like cut him off like cut that IV off and make him go do something else.

99
00:05:37,376 --> 00:05:37,999
Rym: It was good times.

100
00:05:39,662 --> 00:05:41,590
Rym: We played that Serlin what fantasy strike?

101
00:05:42,192 --> 00:05:44,080
Scott: Yeah, that's what we expected it to be.

102
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,796
Rym: Oh, it looks like when we went it's a FPS on FPS.

103
00:05:47,816 --> 00:05:54,442
Rym: when it's a fighting game That is just the rock-paper-scissor of hitting the buttons without having to do the combos Rims.

104
00:05:54,462 --> 00:05:55,104
Rym: real good.

105
00:05:55,124 --> 00:05:56,829
Scott: I mean anyone's real good.

106
00:05:56,869 --> 00:05:58,393
Scott: It's not about you were real good.

107
00:05:58,674 --> 00:06:00,700
Scott: I only have one first four matches.

108
00:06:01,223 --> 00:06:05,298
Rym: Oh, yeah, no you won the first four rounds of a first of five.

109
00:06:05,821 --> 00:06:13,507
Rym: But I want I came back and won all the rest because I chose the most complex character to date solely because he won.

110
00:06:13,527 --> 00:06:22,898
Rym: he's his owner which that's kind of like to play but - he Has a power and his power is just fucking saunter past the other character.

111
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:23,500
Rym: That's it.

112
00:06:23,761 --> 00:06:26,433
Rym: Just walk by a bit of a shit-eating grin.

113
00:06:27,056 --> 00:06:29,265
Rym: and when I saw it I was like, that's my character.

114
00:06:29,285 --> 00:06:30,731
Rym: and then Scott looked at me said room.

115
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:31,554
Rym: That's your character.

116
00:06:31,574 --> 00:06:32,779
Rym: He's my Voldo.

117
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:36,900
Scott: I just I read the instructions for the character that I want to be the fish man.

118
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,255
Scott: But the fish man is not in the game yet.

119
00:06:38,275 --> 00:06:39,600
Rym: He's not yet her or the gambling pan.

120
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:46,490
Scott: I read the instructions for the Rockman and I played as the Rockman and it said yeah If there's a projectile you can smash it.

121
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:48,400
Scott: so I did and you could just smash my project.

122
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,210
Scott: But then I'm like, well, how do I need to get close?

123
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,335
Scott: because I'm a throwing guy.

124
00:06:52,636 --> 00:06:53,500
Scott: How do I get close?

125
00:06:53,922 --> 00:07:00,369
Scott: So the way to get close it said was to slam on the ground like Kirby stone mode Which worked and knocked rims ass down.

126
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,820
Scott: then it said after you do that get close to this button.

127
00:07:03,143 --> 00:07:04,879
Scott: So I did and I did get close.

128
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:15,120
Scott: But then the timing of it was such that when Rym woke up from me getting close Hit me and if I tried to jump over the projectiles it to get close without just smashing him infinitely.

129
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:16,137
Scott: Oh hit me.

130
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,776
Scott: But I could not figure out from the instructions how to get close without getting hit if I wasn't.

131
00:07:21,796 --> 00:07:25,559
Rym: or it was this like great Paper-rock-scissors cuz we're both learning the game like we're no shit about it.

132
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,560
Rym: So like basically if I mess that up at all Scott would get a little too close and I take like three damage.

133
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:33,747
Scott: Yeah, it's so great.

134
00:07:33,768 --> 00:07:44,643
Scott: It doesn't have like this, you know health bar That's like, you know Just you know that it's like you take X number of hits period and some moves do two more than one damage But most and some Blocks.

135
00:07:44,984 --> 00:07:47,933
Rym: Yeah, like my dude didn't have as many Scott's had more cuz he's a heavy.

136
00:07:48,013 --> 00:07:48,996
Scott: I'm a giant Rockman.

137
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:55,959
Rym: Yeah, basically Zangief but it's Like touching it a little bit and watching people play it.

138
00:07:56,362 --> 00:07:59,859
Rym: It appears like it is going to live up to what they intend it to be.

139
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:11,371
Scott: Yes, we can get the experience of playing the top tier fighting game action without having to be able to you know Move buttons move the trick joysticks and push buttons real fast and precisely.

140
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:15,926
Scott: cuz like I when I see but not not so simple And stupid as dive kick, right?

141
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:17,270
Scott: Yep better than granted.

142
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,540
Rym: I really like dive kick - yeah sure, but this replaces dive kick.

143
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,972
Rym: This is just like cuz and it's more.

144
00:08:22,993 --> 00:08:24,319
Scott: it's more of a real game.

145
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,920
Rym: Like when I play dive kick, I think oh man right fighting games.

146
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:31,594
Rym: And then I'd like maybe I play the most recent Soul Calibur at a PAX.

147
00:08:31,614 --> 00:08:32,859
Rym: I'm like, oh right fuck this.

148
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:38,000
Scott: The problem is I went to go get fantasy strike and it's like you had to get it by patreon.

149
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,847
Rym: Yep Which is fine the patreon.

150
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:40,510
Scott: the way it works.

151
00:08:40,571 --> 00:08:44,949
Scott: if you pay five dollars a month You get it with like five characters.

152
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:47,920
Scott: and if you pay ten dollars a month you get it with like seven characters.

153
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,145
Scott: It's like what the fuck is this bullshit?

154
00:08:49,386 --> 00:08:50,891
Scott: Just I'll give you even $50.

155
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:51,815
Scott: Just give me all the goddamn.

156
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:56,012
Rym: Here's here is a use For the GeekNights patreon the first official use.

157
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:56,978
Rym: I've never used any of that money.

158
00:08:57,018 --> 00:09:06,269
Rym: people again I can just redirect that money into other people's patreon Mm-hmm, and then if they don't double dip They don't take the fee like twice as far as I can tell.

159
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:13,640
Rym: so I could spend some of our patron money to send to Fantasy strike so we can then play the game and talk about it.

160
00:09:14,062 --> 00:09:17,980
Scott: But it's feel I mean that's I'm just saying that's way too much money to be charging for that game.

161
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,332
Rym: This is like this is funding the development of the game.

162
00:09:20,373 --> 00:09:23,069
Rym: You're subscribed to the patreon saying yeah I want this game to actually come out.

163
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:27,510
Rym: Well, I'm just gonna wait until it's released But I think I'll back it because I want to get good at it now.

164
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,557
Scott: Yeah, I think I'll be fine.

165
00:09:29,738 --> 00:09:32,789
Rym: Yeah But yeah, we played a lot other games.

166
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:35,239
Rym: We'll talk about as time goes on.

167
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:38,222
Rym: Nintendo switch was there and I don't.

168
00:09:38,282 --> 00:09:44,684
Rym: I still don't understand the people who stand in line because the line was like three hours To play Zelda.

169
00:09:44,805 --> 00:09:48,700
Rym: Yeah, like I always wanted to go to that line and ask everyone in line.

170
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:50,566
Rym: Just two questions one.

171
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:53,073
Rym: Did you pre-order a Nintendo switch already?

172
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:53,836
Rym: and two?

173
00:09:54,157 --> 00:09:55,300
Rym: Did you pre-order this game?

174
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,316
Rym: You're waiting in line for three hours at PAX to play.

175
00:09:57,478 --> 00:09:57,699
Scott: I did.

176
00:09:57,961 --> 00:10:00,012
Rym: I think the answer to both those is yes.

177
00:10:00,395 --> 00:10:01,038
Rym: What the fuck?

178
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:01,881
Rym: Like?

179
00:10:02,122 --> 00:10:03,991
Rym: why packs is no only so many hours?

180
00:10:04,011 --> 00:10:06,000
Rym: you spending three of those hours in that line?

181
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:08,030
Scott: Well, they're always like oh I got my DS.

182
00:10:08,252 --> 00:10:08,533
Scott: Yeah.

183
00:10:08,553 --> 00:10:12,995
Scott: Oh, yeah Always got something like oh, I'm doing something in the line.

184
00:10:13,035 --> 00:10:14,080
Scott: I'm making friends in the line.

185
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,918
Scott: It's like but with three hours, it's like is you're gonna play Zelda for 15 minutes.

186
00:10:18,362 --> 00:10:19,320
Scott: Is that really worth it?

187
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,030
Scott: You could be.

188
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:27,220
Scott: you know The opportunity cost compared to what you did not take you guys much more than three hours to play that fucking train game you played.

189
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:28,846
Scott: Right, you could have played this train game.

190
00:10:28,886 --> 00:10:33,845
Rym: That's three hours long and epic could have played like three captain sonars Even like intense ones.

191
00:10:34,206 --> 00:10:38,160
Scott: right and you can't do that at home a month from now when the switch comes out.

192
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:47,020
Rym: Yeah, but suffice it to say PAX South is My third favorite packs and Australia is cheating because it has the bonus of being in Australia.

193
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,798
Rym: So if you don't count the Australia, it's the second best.

194
00:10:49,838 --> 00:10:57,209
Rym: packs Like you can't go to prime go to eat go to South before you go to East Especially if your tabletop II it's cheaper.

195
00:10:57,349 --> 00:10:58,735
Rym: Yeah, and speaking of packs.

196
00:10:58,796 --> 00:10:59,700
Rym: I think there's some other news.

197
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:07,983
Scott: yeah, the the packs you should really go to if you're Tabletop II is the brand newly announced PAX Unplugged.

198
00:11:08,004 --> 00:11:08,988
Rym: it's in Philly.

199
00:11:09,189 --> 00:11:11,520
Scott: We knew it was coming and couldn't talk about it.

200
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,812
Rym: I've known for so I'm just like sitting on this knowledge.

201
00:11:13,832 --> 00:11:15,059
Rym: It's like wanting to talk about it.

202
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:19,034
Rym: Yeah, well, you know one news because we don't know how it's gonna go down yet.

203
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,932
Scott: Well one news agency Put their story up too early.

204
00:11:22,953 --> 00:11:33,500
Scott: Yep But basically as far as we know the only thing wrong with this pack is it's gonna be in Philly Which is good because it's near us but bad because it's the worst city there is.

205
00:11:35,497 --> 00:11:38,211
Scott: But Yeah, it's gonna be packs in all ways.

206
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:38,673
Scott: It's good.

207
00:11:38,693 --> 00:11:40,340
Scott: I heard is just well.

208
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:43,373
Rym: It's always except the focus is tabletop, right?

209
00:11:43,393 --> 00:11:44,900
Scott: This is just rumors, right?

210
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,900
Scott: But from what I have gathered it is a full packs the Omega thon.

211
00:11:50,221 --> 00:11:53,740
Scott: You know the keynotes the panels the tabletop, right?

212
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,808
Rym: But imagine but the keynote is tabletop twisted.

213
00:11:56,828 --> 00:11:59,556
Rym: the omega-thon is tabletop game, right?

214
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,923
Scott: It's not going to have Console free play.

215
00:12:02,325 --> 00:12:04,090
Scott: It's not going to have the PC zone.

216
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:09,409
Scott: It will not have in the x-ball hall, you know Anyone selling video games?

217
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,920
Scott: unless there may be video versions of board game.

218
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,495
Rym: I assume there won't be a concert but I could be.

219
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:15,099
Rym: I don't know.

220
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:25,146
Scott: Yeah, I don't know about a concert but it's going to have mad RPG and mad dice and mad Meeple and mad all that biz.

221
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,590
Rym: so the worries extra.

222
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:34,693
Rym: there is a fear that it might take a cue from Traditional tabletop cons meaning shitty ones and do some of their biz.

223
00:12:35,175 --> 00:12:36,720
Scott: Yeah, I don't think it's gonna be like those now.

224
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,602
Scott: Here's the problems with it.

225
00:12:37,643 --> 00:12:38,144
Scott: Number one.

226
00:12:38,164 --> 00:12:46,210
Scott: It is the same weekend as BGG con which is in Texas far away And I don't really care about BGG con.

227
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,099
Scott: but a lot of tabletop people do.

228
00:12:48,722 --> 00:12:52,880
Scott: But I think most of them are like the grog nard BGG types that probably aren't going to packs anyway.

229
00:12:53,442 --> 00:12:57,520
Scott: But it's the industry of tabletop can't really go to do conventions at once.

230
00:12:57,762 --> 00:12:59,193
Scott: Publishers are gonna have to choose.

231
00:12:59,294 --> 00:12:59,777
Scott: but danger.

232
00:12:59,798 --> 00:13:05,108
Rym: number two It is also the weekend of the new anime con in New York City the big one

233
00:13:05,188 --> 00:13:12,754
Scott: the one that is made by the people who made the New York anime festival and Are now on their own doing a new thing and it could be a good anime con.

234
00:13:12,774 --> 00:13:16,860
Scott: I got hopes for it, but And the packs came second.

235
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:23,378
Rym: So it's sort of unfair to bail and I like I already committed GeekNights to anime NYC like handshake.

236
00:13:23,418 --> 00:13:24,300
Rym: like I we will be.

237
00:13:24,622 --> 00:13:28,020
Scott: It's like they're announcing this packs way too close to when the packs is happening.

238
00:13:28,221 --> 00:13:34,240
Rym: We might literally have to split up and Scott will go to our shit at packs and I'll go to our shit and anime NYC.

239
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,879
Scott: Yeah, I'm going to the packs for sure.

240
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:43,559
Scott: yeah, I did not commit to the anime NYC even though I really was basically planning to go to it and expecting to go to It and totally on board with it.

241
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,440
Scott: Yeah, but then a packs appeared on top and it's just like I didn't officially commit.

242
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,993
Scott: So I can go to the packs without guilt but not without like.

243
00:13:53,414 --> 00:13:54,397
Scott: just regret that.

244
00:13:54,457 --> 00:13:55,580
Scott: why did they have to do it this way?

245
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,670
Rym: Yeah, cuz like this anime con is basically.

246
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,361
Rym: if any anime con could be the packs of anime cons It's this one.

247
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:01,484
Rym: Like if this one can't do it.

248
00:14:01,605 --> 00:14:02,266
Rym: No one can.

249
00:14:02,347 --> 00:14:02,607
Scott: it's the.

250
00:14:02,828 --> 00:14:05,655
Scott: it's a week before Thanksgiving 2017 November 17th through 19th.

251
00:14:08,004 --> 00:14:13,676
Rym: Yeah, so we'll let you know how that all goes down I would probably bail on the anime one, but I like.

252
00:14:13,736 --> 00:14:14,420
Rym: I shook hands.

253
00:14:14,661 --> 00:14:15,907
Rym: I'm not I can't like.

254
00:14:15,948 --> 00:14:18,199
Rym: I didn't sign a contract but be a dick.

255
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:20,259
Scott: move So and shake no hand.

256
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:25,018
Rym: But if we split up it also means something very important because Scott realized that he's been.

257
00:14:25,038 --> 00:14:28,273
Rym: you know Fat lady Scott realizes he's been to 20 paxes.

258
00:14:28,354 --> 00:14:29,580
Scott: I've been to 20 paxes.

259
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,604
Rym: I don't count pegs dev.

260
00:14:30,624 --> 00:14:34,360
Rym: because that's just part of that's not a but even not counting back dev.

261
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:36,327
Rym: I've been to 21 paxes.

262
00:14:36,387 --> 00:14:37,391
Scott: fine counting pegs dev.

263
00:14:37,431 --> 00:14:37,872
Scott: I went to 21.

264
00:14:37,872 --> 00:14:39,338
Rym: It's not counting max dev.

265
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:44,764
Rym: I've been to like many bags, but I Skip.

266
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:47,000
Rym: you skipped one more pack sauce than I did.

267
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:49,799
Rym: Yeah, but if I don't go to this PAX Unplugged we're tied again.

268
00:14:50,821 --> 00:14:52,267
Rym: But I was ahead before.

269
00:14:52,528 --> 00:14:54,877
Scott: so I think I definitely counts as a real bag.

270
00:14:54,898 --> 00:14:58,753
Rym: That does Yeah, this is all like exciting news.

271
00:14:58,773 --> 00:14:59,719
Rym: We'll see how this all goes.

272
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:07,620
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

273
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:10,806
Rym: So a cloud over packs.

274
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:15,200
Rym: the whole time was that of course like the Republic is falling all around us and all this nonsense happened.

275
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:17,631
Scott: And well, they haven't shut down the GeekNights yet.

276
00:15:17,712 --> 00:15:18,255
Scott: They have not.

277
00:15:18,456 --> 00:15:19,120
Rym: we're still here.

278
00:15:19,241 --> 00:15:31,939
Rym: we are broadcasting from the end of the world maybe but Unrelated to all of that just like you guys on the gold records in his face Unrelated to anything that might be going on politically in America right now.

279
00:15:32,382 --> 00:15:34,414
Rym: My thing of the day is really unrelated.

280
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,340
Scott: you wouldn't have said anything.

281
00:15:35,641 --> 00:15:38,271
Rym: My thing of the day is a succinct YouTube video.

282
00:15:38,793 --> 00:15:42,499
Rym: just if you're gonna make a fist Because you're gonna punch someone.

283
00:15:43,081 --> 00:15:49,440
Rym: Here's a basic video on how to make a basic fist good enough to not break your hand.

284
00:15:50,403 --> 00:15:55,660
Rym: So if you happen to need a fist for whatever reason I recommend you watch this video.

285
00:15:55,941 --> 00:16:01,060
Rym: And if you're not gonna watch this video in the very least don't put your thumb inside your knuckles.

286
00:16:01,464 --> 00:16:02,519
Rym: I was thumb on the outside.

287
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:05,751
Rym: If you're on the outside hit with the first two knuckles.

288
00:16:05,992 --> 00:16:12,539
Scott: don't bend your wrist like if you're not at least You know Competent at fist making I suggest not doing it.

289
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,740
Scott: It's one of those things like yeah, you probably shouldn't use a drill press if you haven't been trained.

290
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:22,979
Rym: Yeah, I imagine a video of the whole hog spinning with you on it and really not happening, right?

291
00:16:24,645 --> 00:16:26,904
Scott: If you want to make fists, yeah You can watch this video.

292
00:16:27,225 --> 00:16:32,516
Rym: if you feel like you need a fist like I just I suggest that you know how to make a fist That that's my thing of the day.

293
00:16:33,764 --> 00:16:34,779
Scott: What was my thing today?

294
00:16:35,582 --> 00:16:36,645
Rym: Cuz I got more fist stuff.

295
00:16:37,366 --> 00:16:42,078
Rym: you who is trying to convince me that there's no punching in taekwondo anyway, it's about kicking.

296
00:16:42,138 --> 00:16:47,830
Scott: so Take two things combined right like take a pen.

297
00:16:48,191 --> 00:16:53,479
Scott: Yeah, you take alright, so first game number one the hearthstone.

298
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:56,947
Scott: Game number two the rhythm heaven.

299
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:59,173
Rym: now rhythm heaven is so mashup rhythm.

300
00:16:59,213 --> 00:17:05,280
Scott: having a game that I don't actually like playing that much I played it for like 10 minutes and I was like, oh this is cute and then I didn't need to play it anymore.

301
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,819
Rym: I like those pony mashups with it more than I like the game.

302
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,319
Scott: So here's a hearthstone mashup of that, you know with rhythm heaven.

303
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,727
Scott: But the thing about this one is is not.

304
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:18,040
Scott: it's not particularly remarkable except in its dramatic production quality.

305
00:17:18,122 --> 00:17:18,718
Scott: It's like whoa.

306
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:21,650
Scott: The production clock value on this is like insane for what it is.

307
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:35,272
Scott: and also the name of the YouTube account On which this is posted is piece of sheet as in piece of a sheet of favor As in poop and it's a piece of toilet paper.

308
00:17:35,312 --> 00:17:37,220
Scott: It looks like to make it even more funny.

309
00:17:37,381 --> 00:17:39,472
Scott: Ah, I don't want to subscribe.

310
00:17:39,512 --> 00:17:41,000

324
00:18:05,236 --> 00:18:11,077
Rym: so, okay In the moment the book of the book was Rebecca we did it.

325
00:18:11,438 --> 00:18:13,264
Scott: it's done Let's do it.

326
00:18:13,304 --> 00:18:14,089
Scott: What's the new book club?

327
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,076
Rym: I gotta pick the next book club.

328
00:18:15,096 --> 00:18:15,680
Scott: It's your turn.

329
00:18:15,881 --> 00:18:16,788
Scott: I'm gonna pick something.

330
00:18:16,808 --> 00:18:17,634
Scott: I got a whole pile of books.

331
00:18:17,654 --> 00:18:18,359
Scott: You want me to pick one?

332
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,559
Rym: So I'll warn you cuz I never actually read doing all the way through.

333
00:18:23,182 --> 00:18:25,490
Rym: So I kind of am leaning toward making it Dune.

334
00:18:25,631 --> 00:18:26,494
Scott: I thought about that.

335
00:18:26,895 --> 00:18:29,608
Scott: Yeah as I read Dune I've think I've said this before.

336
00:18:29,628 --> 00:18:35,293
Scott: I read Dune way back in the middle school But I only started reading it because I was like and stopped reading it and all of them is.

337
00:18:35,554 --> 00:18:40,979
Rym: I know a lot about Dune Partly from reading wiki's partly from playing games.

338
00:18:41,343 --> 00:18:49,224
Scott: I know having conversations I know a lot of proper nouns from Dune and things of that nature because of a nerd and when you're in it's an important Nerd thing.

339
00:18:49,245 --> 00:18:54,566
Scott: and that was the justification for making What's it called wheel of time.

340
00:18:54,686 --> 00:18:59,220
Scott: oh the book club book like I know like and will will you know?

341
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:07,480
Rym: Well adult Scott like Dune more than middle school Out there have heard, you know fears the mind killer like that whole thing and didn't realize it was from Dune.

342
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,268
Scott: I didn't know that was from Dune, but I've heard it before.

343
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:11,780
Scott: Well now you know, I know that spice must flow is Dune?

344
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,486
Rym: Yeah, you know, I know it's Jesser it are.

345
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:15,855
Scott: I know that's a some old ladies in Dune.

346
00:19:16,457 --> 00:19:17,220
Rym: They're not all old.

347
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,115
Rym: You just thought you got that impression from the art in the board game.

348
00:19:20,155 --> 00:19:20,678
Scott: That's correct.

349
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,330
Scott: Yeah I like the board game a lot.

350
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,720
Scott: I like the board game way more than I like.

351
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,730
Rym: Yeah, everyone knows the Baron Harkonnen.

352
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,298
Scott: I know that's a bad dude.

353
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:31,553
Scott: Yep I mean, he's the Baron and no one's a Baron who's a good guy, right?

354
00:19:31,593 --> 00:19:33,199
Rym: There are no good Barons that I can think of.

355
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:37,813
Rym: Nope, there might be an old like German Baron or something in somewhere.

356
00:19:38,134 --> 00:19:39,700
Scott: Rym Rym is a bad guy.

357
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:42,553
Scott: He likes to put barons on people but that's a bad Baron.

358
00:19:42,653 --> 00:19:43,638
Rym: What about very much housing?

359
00:19:43,678 --> 00:19:44,000
Rym: Is he good?

360
00:19:44,981 --> 00:19:45,443
Scott: I don't know.

361
00:19:45,845 --> 00:19:47,936
Scott: I just know that Baron munchausen is the name of a Baron.

362
00:19:47,976 --> 00:19:48,720
Scott: I don't know anything about him.

363
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,024
Rym: What do we need to make the?

364
00:19:50,385 --> 00:19:52,713
Rym: do we need to make the GeekNights like anyway?

365
00:19:53,335 --> 00:19:55,139
Rym: that maybe I'll let's see bear All right.

366
00:19:55,180 --> 00:20:02,260
Rym: So Barons are one step below Viscounts and one step above Baron nets and hereditary Knights.

367
00:20:02,462 --> 00:20:03,695
Scott: So that's actually way low.

368
00:20:03,756 --> 00:20:08,973
Scott: It's like Here's the full ranking Lord Count Baron Baron's way down there.

369
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:12,627
Rym: All right, I'm gonna go from the top to the bottom Emperor King.

370
00:20:12,747 --> 00:20:13,851
Scott: Yep Archduke.

371
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:14,876
Scott: Oh, really?

372
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:18,173
Scott: I didn't know there was Archduke Duke or Grand Prince.

373
00:20:18,193 --> 00:20:18,938
Rym: they're the same level.

374
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,023
Rym: is Then Prince?

375
00:20:21,123 --> 00:20:22,748
Scott: they're putting in extra levels here.

376
00:20:22,808 --> 00:20:23,931
Scott: No, no Prince.

377
00:20:24,032 --> 00:20:24,533
Scott: Yeah, what?

378
00:20:24,653 --> 00:20:26,478
Rym: no, so yeah, so Duke and Prince at the same level.

379
00:20:26,699 --> 00:20:36,616
Rym: Yeah Prince Duke sovereign Prince Marquez marquee though that whole like count the marquee disown marquee marquez count.

380
00:20:36,857 --> 00:20:37,760
Rym: They're all account in power.

381
00:20:37,841 --> 00:20:39,339
Rym: No, okay count palatine is different.

382
00:20:39,623 --> 00:20:51,559
Rym: So marquee is above count Then Viscount then Baron then Baronet then Knight then Esquire then gentleman then fuck you Which ones of those are Lords and which one of them aren't Lord's fuck if I know.

383
00:20:52,403 --> 00:20:54,773
Rym: All right, gentlemen, gentlemen, I'm trying to figure out.

384
00:20:54,813 --> 00:20:55,978
Rym: how do you how you become a gentleman have?

385
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:57,319
Scott: what level Do you have to be to be a Lord?

386
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:05,058
Scott: Cuz Lord is like a whole bunch of them right like all the counts and all the bears Gentlemen was used by anyone who could not claim a real title.

387
00:21:07,143 --> 00:21:11,940
Rym: All right, so Baron Baron Baron Baron old French baron Latin borrow during the ash cameras.

388
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:19,120
Rym: Okay This Wikipedia article is way too long for me to decide whether or not the majority of barons are good or bad.

389
00:21:19,785 --> 00:21:20,995
Rym: So I'm just gonna let it be they're bad.

390
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:32,776
Rym: Otherwise if you were at PAX South and you saw our panel on grind mechanics and games Guess what video of it from paxi prime is on YouTube already.

391
00:21:32,816 --> 00:21:33,498
Scott: Just watch that one.

392
00:21:33,699 --> 00:21:34,140
Scott: How about that?

393
00:21:34,982 --> 00:21:35,405
Rym: Look at that.

394
00:21:35,425 --> 00:21:36,532
Rym: Look how fast we got that.

395
00:21:37,055 --> 00:21:37,700
Rym: see that panel.

396
00:21:38,781 --> 00:21:40,268
Rym: Follow all our stuff on the internet.

397
00:21:40,288 --> 00:21:41,192
Rym: We have YouTube channels.

Scott: We got an awesome How we have more followers than piece of sheep.

400
00:21:45,313 --> 00:21:46,500
Scott: We haven't which is so wrong.

401
00:21:46,861 --> 00:21:49,731
Rym: We have an awesome new forum that you guys should be using.

402
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:50,695
Rym: it tests to sell secure.

403
00:21:50,775 --> 00:21:51,377
Scott: It's not that.

404
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:52,746
Scott: it's not that awesome It's just new.

405
00:21:52,786 --> 00:21:53,493
Rym: It's pretty awesome.

406
00:21:53,674 --> 00:21:59,020
Rym: Yeah Now the old old owners better but then when he upgraded the vanilla I kind of got worse.

407
00:21:59,242 --> 00:22:00,316
Scott: I liked it better than this one.

408
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,329
Rym: I like the old vanilla better than this one But I like this one way better than the new vanilla.

409
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:06,579
Rym: Yeah, and I like all of them better than the PHP BB.

410
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,923
Rym: We never well guess.

411
00:22:07,943 --> 00:22:11,614
Rym: we technically ran one the old days whatever Zeebs and all that.

412
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:14,385
Rym: Mm-hmm the pre GeekNights forums Mm-hmm.

413
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:15,919
Rym: What if anyone remembers those?

414
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,643
Scott: Yeah, all ten people.

415
00:22:17,764 --> 00:22:18,848
Scott: Yeah, we're in the game.

416
00:22:18,888 --> 00:22:21,418
Rym: We ran on there for like a month and then it died out.

417
00:22:21,438 --> 00:22:21,719
Rym: Mm-hmm.

418
00:22:22,923 --> 00:22:23,468
Rym: Any other meta?

419
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,162
Rym: I think that's it Mm-hmm.

420
00:22:25,683 --> 00:22:30,759
Rym: All right, we're gonna be at PAX East doing a panel on I think Friday at like 6 p.m.

421
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:37,279
Rym: I'm not sure I got a check but we're doing a Brand new updated like rewrite of that old how to win panel.

422
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:42,239
Rym: It's called how to play dirty to win.

423
00:22:43,982 --> 00:22:47,280
Rym: You want to fucking win games to the point that your friends won't play games with you anymore.

424
00:22:47,802 --> 00:22:48,746
Rym: That's the panel for you.

425
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,936
Rym: If you want games to not be fun anymore.

426
00:22:50,976 --> 00:22:53,665
Scott: If you're not cheating You're not trying this.

427
00:22:53,765 --> 00:23:00,587
Rym: this panel how to get as close to cheating as possible without actually cheating Mm-hmm, and I think the panel.

428
00:23:00,607 --> 00:23:10,007
Scott: I'm gonna talk about all the things that Rym likes to do Like look at your opponent's eyes to see where they're looking to figure out where they're gonna make their next Dark conversations.

429
00:23:10,047 --> 00:23:17,120
Scott: to distract people don't shuffle the hand of Citadel cards And you pass to the next player and hope they don't shuffle it either and then look at it carefully.

430
00:23:17,421 --> 00:23:27,420
Rym: They pick a card memorize an off-forgotten rule of the game and have a perfect pedantic knowledge of it and let other players Misinterpret it tactically and then interpret it correctly when it's time.

431
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:29,988
Rym: That is how you win games.

432
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,640
Rym: and then I think the panel I'm gonna put in for prime is just cheating.

433
00:23:32,801 --> 00:23:34,854
Rym: Like if you're gonna cheat, let's talk about what cheating is.

434
00:23:34,874 --> 00:23:35,800
Rym: I like week.

435
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,271
Rym: So now we've got grinding winning losing cheating quitting.

436
00:23:39,572 --> 00:23:41,840
Rym: It's the five fact of one word panels.

437
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:44,352
Rym: We're out of her at that and I can't come up with any more.

438
00:23:44,573 --> 00:23:48,171
Scott: anyone got any ideas for game panels Especially if they're a one-word idea.

439
00:23:48,191 --> 00:23:49,859
Rym: Yeah, and don't say gaming.

440
00:23:51,983 --> 00:23:56,333
Rym: So I saw people tweeting about this game Like I. people kept reading pictures of it.

441
00:23:56,514 --> 00:24:02,480
Scott: I had heard about it I had seen the box and then I had seen a news that said it came out on iOS and Android.

442
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:11,100
Scott: I think Android like just the other day I'm think it's five bucks to get the digital version and then I sit down in packs out.

443
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:17,788
Scott: It was like the first game that hits the table and we played it two times Yep, and that's enough to fully review it.

444
00:24:17,949 --> 00:24:21,440
Rym: I have 100% understanding of the quality of this game.

445
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,109
Scott: so you sit down and you see this game and you go holy shit.

446
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:36,819
Scott: your first impression if you're is this is the greatest game You've ever seen because it's got this little cardboard Like potion machine that you construct and you dump a bag of marbles in it and they come down like fucking bejeweled.

447
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,960
Scott: only It's in the real world and not a video game.

448
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,876
Rym: Yeah, and you like take marbles out and then marbles fall down and you make combos.

449
00:24:44,097 --> 00:24:44,900
Scott: It's like whoa.

450
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:49,000
Scott: This is like crazy like that in its own is like the funnest coolest thing.

451
00:24:49,463 --> 00:24:52,000
Scott: It's like better than fucking mousetrap like holy shit.

452
00:24:52,061 --> 00:24:57,155
Rym: This is amazing Despite the utter simplicity of the the rest of the game around it that can see.

453
00:24:57,175 --> 00:25:08,245
Rym: it was enough to where I actually had fun Playing this game Whereas if it had a less clever conceit I would have quit in the middle of the game and said eh right like you see this mechanism and you're like this gonna be Good, let's do this.

454
00:25:08,827 --> 00:25:09,589
Scott: And then you play.

455
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:14,586
Scott: Okay, you play the game and it's sort of a Average game.

456
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:16,779
Rym: So here's my first observation about the game.

457
00:25:17,242 --> 00:25:21,139
Rym: Is that if you because usually someone's gonna teach you the rules, right?

458
00:25:22,181 --> 00:25:28,760
Rym: What I found is that most people who have played this game because I talked to a bunch of people at PAX Who have played the game because just because they played it before?

459
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,668
Rym: Nobody had the timing questions that we had.

460
00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:37,777
Scott: Nobody gave a shit like all the question cuz it's such a simple game It's like a family game, right?

461
00:25:38,683 --> 00:25:43,020
Scott: You wouldn't even think to ask these kinds of questions such a basic game.

462
00:25:43,523 --> 00:25:48,715
Scott: But we asked those questions and then when we grabbed the rule book They didn't answer in the rule book nor did they answer.

463
00:25:48,775 --> 00:25:49,520
Scott: and board game geek.

464
00:25:49,721 --> 00:25:52,740
Scott: So no one on board game geek even asked the questions we were asking.

465
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:58,440
Rym: So some of the questions we asked I did discover were answered in the rule book, but in obtuse ways.

466
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,484
Rym: But they were consistent.

467
00:25:59,805 --> 00:26:02,535
Rym: but some of them I don't think were answered in a consistent way.

468
00:26:02,836 --> 00:26:03,859
Rym: that would satisfy me.

469
00:26:04,282 --> 00:26:05,854
Rym: And you might say but it's a simple game.

470
00:26:05,894 --> 00:26:06,600
Rym: It must not matter.

471
00:26:07,324 --> 00:26:08,632
Rym: It actually would matter a lot.

472
00:26:08,753 --> 00:26:11,934
Rym: it matter a lot because the bejeweled part they're like.

473
00:26:11,974 --> 00:26:15,265
Rym: make a combo is 100% of the game.

474
00:26:15,626 --> 00:26:22,192
Rym: like if you are smart and capable of seeing the best possible combo on the turn That's it.

475
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:22,738
Scott: That's it.

476
00:26:23,863 --> 00:26:34,157
Scott: the only skill based thing in the game is looking at that pile of marbles in the machine and Figuring out the most optimal way to get the most marbles to come out of it in one turn like

477
00:26:34,277 --> 00:26:45,821
Rym: already like When you put the marbles back on the thing in the middle of your turn Matters a lot and the rules are vague and they say like you can't like you have to do it randomly and you can't direct Them.

478
00:26:46,202 --> 00:26:56,252
Rym: but I could legit like do better at the game by pay holding my marbles in a certain way and dropping them So that the black ones fall into the channel.

479
00:26:56,293 --> 00:26:59,047
Rym: I just opened and Continue my combo.

480
00:26:59,168 --> 00:27:00,840
Scott: They really need to change the mechanism.

481
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:01,986
Scott: Such baffles needs.

482
00:27:02,046 --> 00:27:04,800
Rym: it needs a tower on top of the mechanism.

483
00:27:04,941 --> 00:27:06,788
Scott: All it needs is on top of the mechanism.

484
00:27:06,828 --> 00:27:13,720
Scott: instead of dumping the marbles into this flat surface with a bunch of holes at The end it should be in more ever use marble madness like a marble race.

485
00:27:13,948 --> 00:27:21,218
Scott: Oh, yeah There was the one piece that was basically a funnel and the marbles would enter into and spin and spin needs that and then it Would go into the hole in the middle.

486
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:23,509
Scott: Just put one of those on top to feed.

487
00:27:23,569 --> 00:27:31,780
Scott: in that way you put the marbles they spin and spin and spin and spin and They go down one at a time Completely out of any human control into the potion thing.

488
00:27:31,987 --> 00:27:35,348
Rym: Yep But the game really just comes down to like.

489
00:27:35,408 --> 00:27:40,929
Rym: the rest of the rules are ultra ultra simplistic and it feels like the designers And I don't know.

490
00:27:40,989 --> 00:27:51,659
Rym: there's three designers Castelli Crespi and Silva and they haven't done games I particularly know about but I feel like they came up with this cool conceit and then design.

491
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,600
Scott: I came with the simplest game that they could attach to it.

492
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,787
Rym: It is literally just.

493
00:27:56,129 --> 00:27:56,753
Rym: you pull them are?

494
00:27:56,793 --> 00:28:00,280
Rym: you pull a marble off and Then our two marbles.

495
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:00,642
Rym: I forget.

496
00:28:00,702 --> 00:28:06,960
Rym: you pull one marble and then any combos that get made with colors You also pull those off until you don't get any more combo.

497
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,483
Scott: So if there's blue red blue you would take the red marble Which you now have.

498
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:14,980
Scott: now the two blue marbles hit each other and two marbles of the same color handing each other makes them explode.

499
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:31,595
Scott: So you would take those two blue marbles and any other adjacent blue marbles vertically only and you take those and then if that Results in two marbles of the same color smacking into each other in that empty space you just created you would take those and so on and the most you could take would be an entire vertical column.

500
00:28:31,917 --> 00:28:35,800
Scott: if they just Happened to luckily be arranged in such a great way that never happened.

501
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,220
Scott: But you can get a lot of marbles with good arrangements.

502
00:28:38,361 --> 00:28:45,991
Scott: Then you take those marbles and in front of you you got two potions and the potions need Certain colors and certain numbers of marbles to complete.

503
00:28:46,051 --> 00:28:48,500
Rym: so this one needs three red four black and a blue.

504
00:28:48,741 --> 00:28:54,848
Scott: So you put the marbles on the potions to try to complete them and if you complete them You get them and then you take new ones.

505
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:58,480
Rym: each of the potions is a type that has an effect.

506
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,669
Rym: They're like cards you can use once yeah Things like and basically you drink them to do stuff.

507
00:29:02,709 --> 00:29:06,624
Rym: the action on your turn where you pull a marble is the only time you Get combos.

508
00:29:06,665 --> 00:29:09,000
Rym: so all the other options will let you take more marbles.

509
00:29:09,522 --> 00:29:12,611
Rym: But movement of marbles will not generate further combos from right.

510
00:29:12,632 --> 00:29:17,509
Scott: so for example is a potion that you can drink to take one Marble, but nothing explodes when you do that.

511
00:29:17,729 --> 00:29:20,380
Rym: or take two marbles next to each other that are different colors.

512
00:29:20,623 --> 00:29:22,403
Rym: Yep, stuff like that Reuse the boat.

513
00:29:22,423 --> 00:29:28,334
Scott: take as take as many marbles as you want from the bottom horizontal row But no two of them can be the same color.

514
00:29:28,354 --> 00:29:33,100
Scott: so basically that means Get a red a blue a yellow and a black because there's only four marble colors.

515
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,550
Scott: Yeah, you're not gonna use that and see you're getting four out of it.

516
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:40,548
Rym: blow up all the marbles of one color in one row Mm-hmm, and then you also have a tiny pool of three.

517
00:29:40,628 --> 00:29:43,197
Rym: you can basically keep three extra marbles around.

518
00:29:43,237 --> 00:29:43,357
Rym: yeah

519
00:29:43,397 --> 00:29:56,163
Scott: in case you get like A ton of red and your potions don't need a bunch of red right now you could put three Marbles and store them in the side area like a sidebar and that way when you get a new potion Then you can move those into there And you won't get.

520
00:29:56,284 --> 00:29:57,508
Scott: you know you're not wasting the marbles.

521
00:29:57,528 --> 00:29:59,876
Rym: so the potions are all worth varying victory points.

522
00:29:59,896 --> 00:30:00,940
Rym: basically they do this.

523
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,939
Rym: They do they all do things.

524
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,999
Rym: They're all equally powered.

525
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:11,454
Rym: But the more the potions that take more marbles are generally worth a lot more victory points And the game end is actually really weird and fiddly so.

526
00:30:11,474 --> 00:30:12,700
Rym: basically the game ends.

527
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:22,564
Rym: There's these Chivo's achievements and the achievements are like get three potions of the same type or get one like five different kinds of potions Each time.

528
00:30:22,644 --> 00:30:26,035
Rym: if you accomplish that you take one of these achievements is worth like four points.

529
00:30:26,416 --> 00:30:29,479
Rym: once all of the achievements are taken the Game ends after everyone gets equal number of turns.

530
00:30:30,503 --> 00:30:38,860
Rym: but that that doesn't feel super satisfying and Really the way the game goes is you gotta make two fucking potions every round or you lose right?

531
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,500
Scott: So that's the number one problem with this game is that you cannot catch up.

532
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,774
Scott: Yeah, you have two potions in front of you right and it's very snowball.

533
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:56,440
Scott: e as soon as you finish potions You now have these powers that make it easier to finish more potions And then you when you finish those you get powers to help you finish more potions.

534
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:02,757
Scott: But you can never ever no matter what there's no way to finish more than two potions a turn.

535
00:31:02,857 --> 00:31:07,320
Scott: every turn you start with two Potions in front of you and the best you can do is to finish both of them.

536
00:31:07,883 --> 00:31:11,139
Scott: You can also only finish one or fail and finish zero of them.

537
00:31:11,982 --> 00:31:20,579
Scott: So the best you can do is two potions a turn no matter what if you don't do two potions a turn and someone else Does how do you catch up to them if they cuz now not only?

538
00:31:21,081 --> 00:31:24,740
Scott: Would you have to basically hope that they fail and you succeed in order to catch up?

539
00:31:25,161 --> 00:31:33,400
Scott: But they have more completed potions already available to them with powers that will make it easier for them to continue Getting to a turn every turn.

540
00:31:33,942 --> 00:31:44,153
Scott: So as soon as you fail to get two potions on a turn and stop someone else hasn't failed yet you may as well just quit because you can't beat them now and One of the potions is an attack and this is the end.

541
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:46,464
Rym: one of the ambiguous ones We're basically lets.

542
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:47,970
Rym: you can steal someone else's pool.

543
00:31:48,131 --> 00:31:50,200
Scott: You can steal their their side marble.

544
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,290
Rym: It's like explain what the fuck it means by that.

545
00:31:52,330 --> 00:32:02,580
Scott: It just says steal and we came up with like Four different ways that could go down And says you can use a potion at any time on your turn even as soon as you finish it.

546
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,340
Scott: So I finish a potion right and then it's a stealing potion.

547
00:32:06,862 --> 00:32:10,695
Scott: I use it and I steal marbles in someone's pool, but my pool is full.

548
00:32:10,956 --> 00:32:11,880
Scott: Am I allowed to do this?

549
00:32:12,501 --> 00:32:14,420
Scott: Do I have to put the stolen ones into my pool?

550
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,579
Scott: Can I put them directly onto my other potion that isn't finished yet?

551
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,560
Scott: Yeah, I've already done the part of my turn where I'm finishing a potion, right?

552
00:32:22,801 --> 00:32:28,399
Scott: Am I allowed to finish a potion then put more marbles in the other potion and then finish that one or do I have to?

553
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:33,680
Scott: Put you know is my turn to strictly take marbles put marbles finish potions.

554
00:32:34,084 --> 00:32:35,520
Scott: Is it that sequence or not?

555
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,400
Rym: I think and it's not entirely clear the game like the potion stuff probably needs to be a little more complex.

556
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:53,050
Rym: but more importantly the game would be an interesting game of skill if it weren't a game where anyone who's smart can literally look at the board and Trivially calculate the best possible combo they could make.

557
00:32:53,612 --> 00:32:54,836
Scott: here's how I think the game should.

558
00:32:54,897 --> 00:32:55,740
Rym: I would have a timer.

559
00:32:56,485 --> 00:32:58,620
Rym: You get 10 seconds to take your turn, right?

560
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,267
Scott: Here's the first thing that I would do.

561
00:33:00,287 --> 00:33:05,752
Rym: and if you are if you're holding marbles at the end of your turn when the timer Runs out they explode and you lose them.

562
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:12,200
Scott: Here's What I did the two experiments that I would do first if I wanted to make this game better.

563
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:14,380
Scott: Experiment number one is what you just said, right?

564
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,220
Scott: You want to take exactly the right number of marbles like punish people for having unused marbles?

565
00:33:19,782 --> 00:33:20,003
Scott: Right.

566
00:33:20,345 --> 00:33:23,780
Scott: The second thing I would do though is fuck you two potions a turn, right?

567
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,115
Scott: There would be some potions just out there and on your turn make them.

568
00:33:28,477 --> 00:33:38,460
Scott: on your turn You try to you take as many marbles as you can Right by a comboing and then try to get finish as many potions as you can of the available.

569
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,985
Rym: Here's how to make that better.

570
00:33:40,346 --> 00:33:48,600
Rym: you if you have extra marbles, you must put them into the pool potions But if you don't finish one of those potions, they make it easier for the next guy.

571
00:33:49,581 --> 00:33:59,604
Scott: The biggest combo might not be right But the point is just a whole bunch of available Potions and on your turn you take as many marbles as you can and try to finish as many boys as you can who draft The potions like splendor.

572
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:00,287
Scott: you could do that.

573
00:34:00,548 --> 00:34:01,914
Rym: Here's of increasing power.

574
00:34:01,974 --> 00:34:03,320
Scott: drafting the potions is good.

575
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:04,010
Scott: Also this is

576
00:34:04,031 --> 00:34:09,079
Rym: then you have pads Like if you're falling behind go for a bigger potion because you make the bigger potions have bigger powers, too

577
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:19,583
Scott: Right, you could basically make this a lot like splendor of machi karo where instead of just take coins as your turn It's you know, there's a little game for taking the coins and if you play that game, well, you can get more coins Right.

578
00:34:19,885 --> 00:34:20,929
Scott: So that's the first thing I would do.

579
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:23,620
Rym: to make things better is the most easy thing to do.

580
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:35,384
Rym: just like your turn is X seconds and like 30 is the most I give and just do what you can make you shit and You bet you'd better not be holding any marbles when the timer hits zero Mm-hmm, I cuz.

581
00:34:35,404 --> 00:34:39,417
Rym: then it's not a stare at the board for a minute to figure out the perfect combo.

582
00:34:39,638 --> 00:34:40,400
Rym: It's shit.

583
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:40,882
Rym: What do I do?

584
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:43,010
Rym: Uh, I need black running out of time.

585
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:43,773
Rym: Fuck it BAM.

586
00:34:44,114 --> 00:34:44,315
Scott: Mm-hmm.

587
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:45,600
Rym: That could be a much better game.

588
00:34:45,902 --> 00:34:47,679
Scott: There's a lot of things you could do to make this game better.

589
00:34:48,202 --> 00:34:55,973
Scott: The game is but the mark the marble part is really cool and you get that when you if you buy the game you have The one-time fun of putting together the marble machine.

590
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:57,460
Scott: Yeah, which is a little fun project.

591
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:07,355
Rym: But so minutes like it's a it you know what if you have kids like if you're a family a great kid This is like this is a but a plus game super great kids game.

592
00:35:07,455 --> 00:35:10,045
Scott: compared to like Candyland garbage This is like holy shit.

593
00:35:10,065 --> 00:35:10,507
Scott: So good.

594
00:35:10,707 --> 00:35:15,528
Rym: Yeah a kid who plays this is gonna be way better at like but you'll type Elementary even middle school.

595
00:35:15,548 --> 00:35:20,411
Scott: This is like an a-plus game like holy crap But for adults is like a suit.

596
00:35:20,511 --> 00:35:21,736
Scott: are smart about games.

597
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:22,479
Rym: It is.
