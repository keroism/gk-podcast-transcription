1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,653
Scott: It's Wednesday May 17th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,693 --> 00:00:15,700
Scott: We talk about the worst anime ever.

3
00:00:18,342 --> 00:00:23,052
Rym: Let's do this Despite purchasing the new Mario game for the DS.

4
00:00:23,073 --> 00:00:24,459
Rym: We were very productive today.

5
00:00:25,343 --> 00:00:32,971
Scott: that's because we purchased many other things and We ate and we did all kinds of stuff before we played it.

6
00:00:33,132 --> 00:00:41,184
Rym: Yeah, we were very non geek kind of normal person I mean we put a new clothesline out in the back which took quite a bit of doing Yeah, but you know what?

7
00:00:41,244 --> 00:00:42,650
Scott: as soon as they're done recording this shit.

8
00:00:43,032 --> 00:00:49,420
Scott: It's gonna be Mario Mario Mario Mario Yeah, some Mario multiplayer, and you won't get to find out about it until next Tuesday.

9
00:00:50,561 --> 00:00:52,010
Rym: All I'll say is I like the game a lot.

10
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,474
Rym: I've already beaten world world one And those mega mushrooms are fantastic.

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,025
Scott: Oh God yeah, like.

12
00:01:00,106 --> 00:01:03,900
Scott: I thought they were just gonna like be bleh, but the way they're the way they work is really cool.

13
00:01:04,162 --> 00:01:06,499
Rym: Plus this is one thing and I got to say something about this now.

14
00:01:07,022 --> 00:01:11,599
Rym: The music is always like dupe dupe dupe dupe and some people like a little choir goes like ha ha.

15
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:21,469
Rym: Whenever the music goes ha all the goombas do a little jump in unison if they're on the screen and all the turtles go do Like a little dance like ha ha and it's just.

16
00:01:21,529 --> 00:01:22,111
Rym: it's hilarious.

17
00:01:22,372 --> 00:01:23,015
Scott: Yeah, it's.

18
00:01:23,055 --> 00:01:24,280
Scott: there's really good stuff going on.

19
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,128
Rym: There's lots of little stuff like that.

20
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:28,920
Rym: Nintendo's really got it going with the little and we've only played level one.

21
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,886
Scott: So wait till next Tuesday.

22
00:01:30,088 --> 00:01:36,580
Rym: Yeah, so in the actual news Normally, I wouldn't really talk about something like this or I'd wait until a Monday, but this is just too ludicrous.

23
00:01:37,324 --> 00:01:40,480
Rym: The RIAA has sued XM radio.

24
00:01:41,622 --> 00:01:44,420
Scott: Did XM radio download some mp3s with Kazaa?

25
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:56,638
Rym: Well their basic argument is that the XM radio technology can store songs on it You know time shifting and such or even just storing it temporarily while it buffers or plays to you.

26
00:01:57,442 --> 00:02:00,840
Rym: Therefore it has quote-unquote iPod like capabilities.

27
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:09,898
Rym: Therefore they claim that it's all sorts of violations and vague laws and stupid crap and they want to renegotiate the royalties and charge more.

28
00:02:13,363 --> 00:02:14,600
Scott: But there's an iPod.

29
00:02:15,342 --> 00:02:16,707
Rym: Yeah, and they don't like that either.

30
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:19,797
Rym: remember when they sued the the first because you don't like it.

31
00:02:20,078 --> 00:02:21,565
Rym: tough shit No, but it's there.

32
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:22,771
Rym: remember that's the way America works.

33
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:24,640
Rym: You can sue anyone for anything at any time.

34
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,840
Rym: There's nothing to stop you from suing people.

35
00:02:28,342 --> 00:02:32,174
Scott: Well, I'm sure XM won't take this lying down because they're all who they haven't.

36
00:02:32,214 --> 00:02:34,020
Scott: they're already kind of losing to serious.

37
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:36,819
Scott: So they're not gonna take a lawsuit that'll put them away for good.

38
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:41,340
Rym: XM said they're going to fight this to the end to the bitter horrid end.

39
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,432
Rym: They're putting their entire team behind and they will not back down.

40
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:46,299
Scott: All I can think about is how.

41
00:02:47,162 --> 00:03:08,464
Scott: You know people were talking a few weeks ago about how the if you took all the technology companies versus all the music companies and record companies in the US Like just Microsoft or just Google could buy and sell them all the record companies together like over and over again Multiple times.

42
00:03:09,046 --> 00:03:19,469
Scott: it's insane that these record companies which are so measly and worthless are pushing around these giant powerful technology companies because they dump all this money to lobbyists.

43
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:25,019
Rym: and All the technology companies are busy making more technology and they don't really worry about it so much.

44
00:03:25,662 --> 00:03:31,199
Scott: And they're not really good at lobbyists because you don't need to lobby to do perfectly normal and legitimate goods.

45
00:03:32,407 --> 00:03:37,799
Scott: Yeah for now You only need to lobby when you're doing bad shit and you need to make sure the government doesn't stop you from doing bad shit.

46
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:42,515
Scott: If you're doing perfectly normal stuff, like let's say I'm a manufacturer of goods.

47
00:03:42,695 --> 00:03:48,419
Scott: I buy raw materials I process them into you know, worked goods and I sell them.

48
00:03:49,144 --> 00:03:51,540
Scott: I don't need to lobby because I'm not doing anything wrong.

49
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:55,112
Rym: You need to lobby if you have other people lobbying against you.

50
00:03:55,513 --> 00:03:58,880
Scott: if my business model depends on a law Existing then I need to lobby.

51
00:03:59,602 --> 00:04:06,200
Rym: Yeah, but what if the some lobbyists against may see you make milk and some anti milk lobbyists are making your milk industry collapse?

52
00:04:07,442 --> 00:04:10,851
Scott: Yeah The exact opposite is.

53
00:04:10,891 --> 00:04:16,380
Scott: no one's trying to get rid of milk But there's a billion people trying to make milk plus plus more than its worth.

54
00:04:16,762 --> 00:04:20,427
Rym: I'm more worried about this bacon trend that we've been noticing though It might just be that we don't eat it.

55
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:34,720
Rym: like most stuff on the walls normal restaurants Every single item on the menu at TGI Friday's had bacon and cheese Literally, we're not kidding other than like the appetizers which most of them actually had bacon anyway, and the vegetarian menu.

56
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,485
Rym: Everything had bacon.

57
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:39,760
Rym: every single burger listed on the menu had bacon and cheese on it.

58
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,512
Scott: It went to quiz knows bacon and cheese, even though it tastes good.

59
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,159
Scott: I had it but bacon and cheese.

60
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,748
Rym: We're thinking that it has to do with the fact that pigs are fed mostly on corn Which is made very easily and cheaply in the United States.

61
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:53,800
Scott: ergo bacon and of course cheese.

62
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,719
Rym: Yeah, cheese.

63
00:04:56,782 --> 00:04:59,159
Rym: It'd be fine if it wasn't that processed yellow crap cheese.

64
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:12,600
Scott: I think bacon cheese and corn are the three foods that like if you look ask any American Or you just look inside the stomach of an average American 90% of what's in there is gonna be bacon cheese and corn.

65
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:13,323
Rym: I don't know.

66
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:17,580
Rym: I think our friend Dave tips the scale entirely toward bologna and my Wonder bread.

67
00:05:18,544 --> 00:05:21,365
Scott: Well Wonder breads corn Not so much.

68
00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:22,631
Scott: Yeah, really go look.

69
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:23,154
Scott: It's scary.

70
00:05:23,174 --> 00:05:24,340
Scott: There's a lot of corn syrup in there.

71
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:27,319
Rym: Oh, yeah, there's corn syrup and a lot of things but it's mostly wheat.

72
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,567
Rym: Yeah There's not so much call.

73
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:32,149
Scott: It's really.

74
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:34,580
Scott: it's less we eat or else it would be wheat bread.

75
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,633
Scott: It's more really bleached as crap bear, you know, but that's still wheat.

76
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:40,936
Scott: You're not whole wheat.

77
00:05:41,438 --> 00:05:44,265
Rym: It's still a wheat though It's just bleached refined wheat.

78
00:05:44,606 --> 00:05:45,869
Scott: Yeah, which is mostly flour.

79
00:05:45,989 --> 00:05:46,932
Scott: It's almost flour.

80
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:47,995
Rym: flour is just wheat.

81
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:52,012
Rym: Yeah, it's all wheat Still unless you make oat bread.

82
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:53,299
Rym: It's all wheat.

83
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:56,767
Scott: Then why did they have wheat bread and white bread?

84
00:05:56,867 --> 00:05:57,630
Rym: because wheat bread.

85
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,219
Rym: they call it that it's just less processed and there's more wheat.

86
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:07,209
Rym: Okay, whole wheat not a sweet Alright, so you got a news cuz there's nothing.

87
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:17,002
Rym: Alright, there's nothing I can say about my news other than that The RIAA is horrible corrupt bastardly evil Manipulative.

88
00:06:17,423 --> 00:06:18,326
Rym: I could go on for a while.

89
00:06:18,346 --> 00:06:19,068
Rym: I'm just gonna stop there.

90
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:19,650
Scott: Yep.

91
00:06:20,152 --> 00:06:21,797
Scott: My news is anime related.

92
00:06:22,198 --> 00:06:31,300
Scott: fear that This fall We're gonna be downloading because it surely won't be available in English on DVD at that time.

93
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:36,924
Scott: It'll just be coming on to Japanese TV An anime Hopefully fansubbed.

94
00:06:36,984 --> 00:06:38,672
Scott: Well, I can guarantee it'll be fansubbed.

95
00:06:39,295 --> 00:06:40,380
Rym: We'd better get a hold of this anime.

96
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,940
Rym: If I don't watch it, I might get all upside down II inside adding maybe some twisty turning.

97
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,932
Scott: Okay, um that note that note death note.

98
00:06:50,393 --> 00:06:51,558
Scott: It could be some death note anime.

99
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,000
Rym: I don't know.

100
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,413
Rym: I'm still really really excited about the death note live-action.

101
00:06:55,754 --> 00:06:59,860
Scott: Yeah, like I wasn't so excited I was like, yeah, I'll see it someday like the initial D live-action.

102
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,563
Scott: I'll see it something.

103
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:01,629
Rym: but we saw the trailer.

104
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,469
Scott: but then I saw the trailer which was Exactly like the manga only live-action.

105
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,866
Rym: like you're watching the trailer and the whole time you'll think like, ooh I hope they do this.

106
00:07:10,906 --> 00:07:11,712
Rym: then they show you the scene.

107
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:12,598
Rym: You're like, oh they did it.

108
00:07:13,163 --> 00:07:14,696
Rym: Oh, I wonder if they're gonna you and then you see it.

109
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,299
Rym: I wonder if he looks like oh everyone looks exactly the way they should.

110
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:23,056
Rym: Everyone looks like they're acting really well and then at the end you think wait a minute.

111
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,908
Rym: There's one character I didn't say there is.

112
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:27,383
Scott: yeah It's amazing.

113
00:07:27,443 --> 00:07:28,728
Scott: go if you don't if you know about.

114
00:07:28,768 --> 00:07:31,056
Scott: if you don't know about that note read the manga.

115
00:07:31,096 --> 00:07:32,019
Scott: the manga is the best.

116
00:07:32,981 --> 00:07:35,649
Scott: Death note is probably after you read the manga.

117
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:37,555
Scott: There are five volumes out in English right now.

118
00:07:37,595 --> 00:07:38,759
Scott: The sixth one is coming soon.

119
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:46,540
Scott: go and watch the trailer for the movie and Then wait for this anime and keep buying the manga as it comes out in English.

120
00:07:47,082 --> 00:07:48,991
Rym: I don't think it's gonna be a initial D movie.

121
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:50,780
Rym: In fact, I think it's going to be the exact opposite.

122
00:07:51,502 --> 00:07:52,672
Scott: Yeah, I'm still skeptical.

123
00:07:52,713 --> 00:07:53,560
Scott: the anime will be good.

124
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,514
Scott: I mean sure I'll download it and watch it all and maybe even buy all the DVDs.

125
00:07:57,554 --> 00:07:59,320
Scott: just cuz I'm a huge Death Note fan.

126
00:07:59,861 --> 00:08:04,193
Scott: But Death Note is a lot of it isn't moving in action.

127
00:08:04,273 --> 00:08:05,516
Scott: It's internal monologue.

128
00:08:05,576 --> 00:08:06,960
Rym: It's it's light thinking.

129
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:09,640
Scott: Yeah, it won't gain a lot by being animated.

130
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,740
Scott: You'll have if you if you do a not a very good translation from the manga.

131
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:27,140
Scott: You'll you either have to really speed things up and skip over a bunch of parts People are just standing there talking or a lot of minutes internal monologue, which is usually painful and terrible.

132
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,560
Scott: Yeah, at least in an anime.

133
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:36,351
Scott: so I really want to see how they do it without either a ruining my death note is about or be Being really boring anime.

134
00:08:36,451 --> 00:08:44,400
Scott: now the movie I think has a much more Potential because in the movie you just take the key events and string them together and you skip all the boring stuff in.

135
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,300
Rym: Well, not only that but I like to look at it.

136
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:56,138
Rym: The initial D movie got all the wrong things right like they focused on like oh We're gonna have this thing from the show and this thing from the show and this thing from the show and they had him Exactly from the show.

137
00:08:56,641 --> 00:09:04,078
Scott: The problem is that didn't add anything to the movie and the movie itself was crap as a result because the movie didn't have the good Things from the show it only took the bad things in the show.

138
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:11,696
Rym: now I have a feeling that the Death Note movie is gonna have the right things wrong Meaning they'll know which things need to be altered for the screen and that sort of thing.

139
00:09:11,716 --> 00:09:14,179
Scott: Mm-hmm But then they'll do them wrong.

140
00:09:15,783 --> 00:09:17,220
Scott: Not you said right things wrong.

141
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:22,751
Rym: Yeah Because before I said wrong things right Initial D had the wrong things right as opposed to the right things wrong.

142
00:09:22,991 --> 00:09:24,958
Rym: You change the things to be wrong according.

143
00:09:25,219 --> 00:09:25,520
Scott: Okay?

144
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,026
Scott: Okay, you just didn't get it.

145
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:28,030
Scott: It's not I can do.

146
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,059
Rym: I was being clever with words and you just missed it.

147
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:31,526
Scott: No, no, you weren't so clever.

148
00:09:31,546 --> 00:09:32,430
Scott: You were just obtuse.

149
00:09:32,832 --> 00:09:34,740
Rym: the right things wrong as opposed to the wrong things, right?

150
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:35,930
Rym: I think that's pretty clear.

151
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,679
Scott: I think you're just wrong.

152
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,373
Scott: Okay, okay Death Note anime baby.

153
00:09:40,615 --> 00:09:49,538
Rym: All right I'm the juggernaut bitch.

154
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:54,713
Rym: I'm the juggernaut bitch Fucking Charles get out of my head.

155
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:55,519
Rym: What are you doing?

156
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:57,831
Rym: LSD fuck.

157
00:09:57,872 --> 00:09:58,277
Rym: is this shit?

158
00:09:59,440 --> 00:09:59,681
Rym: All right.

159
00:10:00,304 --> 00:10:05,308
Rym: This is something that I saw a long time ago, and I thought it was stupid Like it was a good years on Google video.

160
00:10:05,328 --> 00:10:20,456
Rym: And actually I think I saw it on a website somewhere and It was just this video of some guy dubbing over some voices in the x-men The original good Fox x-men cartoon, which is the only x-men that Scott likes pretty much.

161
00:10:20,757 --> 00:10:24,334
Rym: I watched about 30 seconds of it and thought wow, this is just stupid.

162
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,319
Rym: didn't bother with it.

163
00:10:25,922 --> 00:10:30,540
Rym: So today we were looking at funny cat videos on Google's top video top 100.

164
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,977
Scott: Yeah, if you're ever bored just go on Google video and search for funny cat videos.

165
00:10:34,057 --> 00:10:34,640
Scott: Oh my god.

166
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,246
Rym: Yeah, search like cat or puppy.

167
00:10:36,306 --> 00:10:40,260
Rym: My favorite video along those lines is the cat versus a million puppies.

168
00:10:41,563 --> 00:10:48,394
Rym: It's just this cat sitting there like man And like 11 puppies standing around the cat like ooh, look at that.

169
00:10:48,455 --> 00:10:49,157
Rym: Ooh, what's this?

170
00:10:49,177 --> 00:10:49,458
Rym: What's this?

171
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:49,719
Rym: What's this?

172
00:10:49,739 --> 00:10:53,803
Rym: Let's play Let's play and the cats like what the fuck Go away.

173
00:10:53,843 --> 00:10:56,011
Scott: the Fox on the trampoline is also quite good.

174
00:10:56,051 --> 00:10:58,580
Rym: Yeah, the Fox on the trampoline that things been getting everywhere.

175
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,126
Rym: I bet it'll hit Google's top hundred soon.

176
00:11:00,286 --> 00:11:03,719
Rym: Probably it's just this Fox who finds the trampoline and goes nuts on it.

177
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:12,521
Rym: But anyway, I saw this thing on Google's video top 100 and I thought what the hell how can that be on top 100?

178
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:13,358
Rym: This thing is just ass.

179
00:11:14,285 --> 00:11:16,879
Rym: So then I watched it all of it all nine minutes of it.

180
00:11:18,021 --> 00:11:19,934
Rym: It's any individual moment of it.

181
00:11:19,975 --> 00:11:20,619
Rym: Isn't that funny?

182
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,200
Rym: But in aggregate it just becomes more and more stupid and hilarious.

183
00:11:26,245 --> 00:11:29,908
Scott: Get you my pimp cane My pick-pimp cane.

184
00:11:29,928 --> 00:11:30,572
Rym: look at all this money.

185
00:11:30,612 --> 00:11:31,517
Rym: I got bitch.

186
00:11:31,577 --> 00:11:36,785
Rym: I'm the juggernaut The juggernaut bitch I'm not sure.

187
00:11:36,865 --> 00:11:37,448
Rym: just watch it.

188
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,654
Rym: I'm not sure why it's funny.

189
00:11:39,035 --> 00:11:44,839
Rym: The voice acting is It's not really well synced, but they really got into it the guys that were doing it and it.

190
00:11:45,503 --> 00:11:53,860
Scott: It's got this like low level of humor throughout Yeah, and you don't even really have to know anything about the x-men or who these characters are to think it's funny.

191
00:11:54,382 --> 00:11:57,873
Scott: But if you do know who they are, it'll be like it'll add a tiny bit.

192
00:11:58,535 --> 00:12:01,376
Rym: It's real close to lowbrow really close.

193
00:12:03,081 --> 00:12:06,980
Scott: Alright, my thing today is also a Google video that I found at work while I was bored.

194
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:09,599
Rym: This one's just kind of like creepy.

195
00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:12,793
Scott: I Figured it's martial arts kind of.

196
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:13,900
Scott: so I guess it.

197
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:19,659
Rym: Yeah, if there's a martial art called to hurt yourself severely with no gain exactly my point.

198
00:12:21,362 --> 00:12:25,460
Scott: So it fits in on anime day, I guess this is what from Malaysia, right?

199
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:31,700
Scott: So this is a video of some Malaysian people doing quote unquote extreme martial arts training.

200
00:12:33,225 --> 00:12:34,258
Rym: I'm just picturing it again.

201
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,840
Scott: So the video starts with this guy who climbs up this tower.

202
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:43,356
Scott: It's like must be more than 50 feet tall like maybe 75 feet tall.

203
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:46,328
Rym: No, no, no It looks like it's about 30 or 40 feet tall.

204
00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:46,971
Scott: It's pretty tall.

205
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,080
Rym: Anyway, I know what a 70 foot tall tower.

206
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,379
Scott: Anyway, it's tall enough where if I jumped off of it, I would die.

207
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:57,219
Rym: Yeah, I imagine a pile of Rym laying at the bottom of this thing.

208
00:12:57,842 --> 00:13:02,760
Scott: So this guy jumps off and turns into a pile of him laying at the bottom of this thing.

209
00:13:02,921 --> 00:13:03,988
Rym: But then they get him up.

210
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:04,511
Rym: they steady him.

211
00:13:04,531 --> 00:13:05,840
Rym: His legs are obviously broken.

212
00:13:06,181 --> 00:13:12,180
Scott: He's like his entire body turns purple and bruised and it's horrible and his legs have to be broken.

213
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,760
Scott: There's no way they can't be it's just obvious.

214
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:22,928
Rym: So he's standing there and he's breathing and he does himself off and they help him over and he climbs the thing again And does it again.

215
00:13:22,948 --> 00:13:24,699
Rym: this time he lands on his face.

216
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,987
Scott: Yeah, this guy does this like three or four times.

217
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:32,760
Scott: It's quite like at first you're like, whoa, but then later you're like, oh god.

218
00:13:34,182 --> 00:13:43,400
Rym: now there's obviously a little bit of trickery going on in that it's pretty obvious that the ground is Saturated with water and a little soft, but he obviously has a technique for landing.

219
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,516
Scott: But at the same time even so he is he is a wounded man.

220
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:48,700
Scott: He is severely wounded.

221
00:13:48,841 --> 00:13:50,628
Scott: Now the second part of the video.

222
00:13:50,648 --> 00:13:52,334
Scott: they show people jumping through glass.

223
00:13:52,394 --> 00:13:53,760
Scott: now, this isn't really much of a trick.

224
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:56,712
Scott: They use really thin glass that breaks easily.

225
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:58,400
Rym: It's not a sugar glass so it can't hurt you.

226
00:13:59,203 --> 00:14:03,660
Scott: They run then they jump and they put their hand their arms over their head.

227
00:14:04,181 --> 00:14:06,891
Scott: They jump headfirst through the glass, of course their arm.

228
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:07,754
Scott: They're really going arm.

229
00:14:07,794 --> 00:14:14,079
Scott: first the glass breaks They roll the rest of their body through the glass while minimally touching it.

230
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:19,480
Scott: Then they roll on the ground and they turn around and strike some cool martial arts pose.

231
00:14:19,982 --> 00:14:21,129
Rym: That part's not so exciting.

232
00:14:21,712 --> 00:14:24,990
Scott: then at the end of the video They combine the two.

233
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:36,360
Scott: a guy runs jumps through glass and Then basically out of a building and then he lands on the ground outside the building and he's not dead But I think he's close at this point.

234
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:41,620
Scott: Yeah, I think that guy is when he jumps out of that building just right face on the ground not move.

235
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,931
Scott: Yeah, this guy doesn't land on his legs with any trickery.

236
00:14:43,971 --> 00:14:48,660
Scott: This guy lands like wump Big gash on his leg.

237
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,660
Scott: Yeah, the glass fell out of the window apparently and he must have landed on the glass and he fucked himself up.

238
00:14:55,942 --> 00:14:57,834
Scott: So watch this video and go.

239
00:14:57,854 --> 00:15:11,291
Scott: wow If you think you know crazy Christians and people who believe in Randy bullshit in this country I like how you started with crazy Christians, of course These people are infinitely more stupid now.

240
00:15:11,512 --> 00:15:17,799
Rym: my best guess as to what's going on here This is rims best guest TM as opposed to my actual best guess.

241
00:15:19,058 --> 00:15:29,129
Rym: I Imagine some people who went to Malaysia thinking I'm going to become the Malaysian martial arts master and I will find these people to train me like, you know the people who go to try to become kung-fu monks.

242
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,170
Rym: and Then a bunch of guys find him.

243
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:40,594
Rym: They're like, yes, we will train you Jump out of that building Repeatedly, it will make you strong and then he comes back a week later.

244
00:15:40,614 --> 00:15:42,020
Rym: He's like I've been jumping out of that building.

245
00:15:42,404 --> 00:15:44,623
Rym: I feel stronger and they're like Crap.

246
00:15:44,663 --> 00:15:45,306
Rym: he's still alive.

247
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:45,928
Rym: What do we do now?

248
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:49,260
Rym: Tell him to jump through a plate glass window out of a building.

249
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:50,716
Rym: All right that finished him off.

250
00:15:54,402 --> 00:15:54,844
Rym: You know what.

251
00:15:54,884 --> 00:15:57,676
Scott: that's probably not true, but it makes a better story than the truth.

252
00:15:58,318 --> 00:16:07,360
Rym: so well We'll pretend for now All right, so it's worst week and we're gonna talk about the worst anime ever.

253
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:13,280
Scott: Now there's some bad anime out there and there's some anime we hate like.

254
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,081
Scott: I don't know.

255
00:16:14,121 --> 00:16:15,285
Scott: What's a bad anime?

256
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:17,875
Rym: That's not the worst of air gear tactical roar.

257
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:22,611
Scott: Yeah air gear tactical roar Those are bad shows, but they're not the worst shows ever.

258
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:23,735
Scott: and Naruto.

259
00:16:23,755 --> 00:16:24,960
Scott: We don't really like so much.

260
00:16:25,181 --> 00:16:27,900
Scott: Well, we like the first few episodes, but then it's down hill.

261
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,651
Rym: Yeah, or like Yu Yu Hakusho was one episode of cute two episodes of cute.

262
00:16:31,872 --> 00:16:34,520
Scott: Oh, yeah - two episodes followed by crap.

263
00:16:35,084 --> 00:16:41,940
Scott: Yep, so in Dragon Ball Z We really don't like and it's just crap fighting but it's not the worst ever.

264
00:16:42,564 --> 00:16:44,619
Rym: We're talking about the worst of the worst.

265
00:16:45,565 --> 00:16:48,803
Scott: So terrible, you can't watch it Like like.

266
00:16:49,184 --> 00:16:50,828
Scott: there's some things that are so bad.

267
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,152
Scott: you MST 3k them.

268
00:16:52,473 --> 00:16:54,198
Scott: These are the things that are so bad.

269
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:57,105
Scott: you just Burn them in a fire now.

270
00:16:57,145 --> 00:17:00,234
Rym: We're leaving out a lot of things that we haven't actually seen.

271
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:02,660
Rym: for yeah, I do megalopolis.

272
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:04,444
Scott: Yeah, do megalopolis is?

273
00:17:04,926 --> 00:17:09,260
Scott: it looks like it's really bad and I've heard it's really bad from a lot of people.

274
00:17:09,682 --> 00:17:10,548
Scott: And what's that about milk?

275
00:17:10,588 --> 00:17:12,358
Rym: something super milk Sean?

276
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,540
Rym: Well, actually that comes out of the fact that right before the show I did some research on the Internet.

277
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:25,429
Rym: I went to a whole bunch of forums looking for threads about worst anime and going through them to see What the Internet as a whole seemed to think the worst anime are.

278
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,275
Rym: I'll note that one.

279
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:31,419
Rym: they systematically listed every anime ever.

280
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,589
Scott: Yeah, that doesn't really help.

281
00:17:34,951 --> 00:17:37,060
Rym: and a lot of people listed things that weren't anime.

282
00:17:37,601 --> 00:17:41,915
Scott: Yeah, that was also bad like totally spies or x-men.

283
00:17:42,256 --> 00:17:43,580
Scott: yeah x-men is not an anime.

284
00:17:43,681 --> 00:17:45,173
Scott: There is no x-men anime.

285
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:50,120
Rym: shut up But I mean there were people who were like yeah eska flow day is like the worst thing I've ever seen.

286
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,926
Rym: It's just slow and crappy and the music's terrible.

287
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:52,548
Rym: Did they walk?

288
00:17:52,688 --> 00:18:02,320
Scott: Oh, and we're also gonna leave out things like the Fox eska flown a and What is it warriors of the wind the worst right thing to ever happen to anime?

289
00:18:03,102 --> 00:18:14,920
Scott: So if someone took a good anime or at least an anime that wasn't the worst anime and they remixed it or edited it or Modified it in some way to make it the worst anime that doesn't count.

290
00:18:15,481 --> 00:18:23,335
Scott: For example one piece on American television is crap compared to the real one piece anime in Japan but that doesn't count.

291
00:18:23,356 --> 00:18:30,266
Rym: and Also while we're gonna leave a lot out after we name a few infamous shows We're gonna kind of try to do a generic.

292
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:34,720
Rym: here are the calling signs of the bad bad bad bad bad anime.

293
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:41,977
Scott: All right, let's save the worst for last and start with the big one.

294
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:43,649
Rym: Which one?

295
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:49,240
Rym: I think you were leaving a real bag hoping yeah Let's start with Legend of Lemnier Lemnier.

296
00:18:50,121 --> 00:18:52,910
Scott: Yeah, um we didn't make a list.

297
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,580
Rym: I can explain the plot, but it doesn't matter.

298
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:57,620
Rym: There's something about the silver something.

299
00:18:58,142 --> 00:18:58,926
Rym: There's a guy.

300
00:18:58,946 --> 00:19:05,272
Scott: I don't remember the plot cuz I saw it once and I burned my eyes out So I'd never see it again, and then I forgot a girl.

301
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:06,939
Rym: There's swords and magic.

302
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:09,828
Rym: Everyone gets randomly naked.

303
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:20,540
Scott: yeah boobies boobies boobies boobies, but it's not pent I it's just you know how in fantasy stuff that or sci-fi stuff You'll often have the girls shirt gets torn off just randomly.

304
00:19:21,342 --> 00:19:27,140
Rym: This happens a lot in Lemnier like what the plot is just like stupid deus ex machina crap.

305
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:28,708
Rym: There's really nothing to it.

306
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:30,056
Scott: animation is bad.

307
00:19:30,176 --> 00:19:32,685
Scott: Everyone's ugly Thank God.

308
00:19:32,726 --> 00:19:33,429
Scott: This is only like.

309
00:19:33,449 --> 00:19:35,219
Scott: was it a movie or an OVA?

310
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:38,480
Rym: I don't know how long it was, but it felt like it was four hours.

311
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,436
Scott: I think it was just one movie, and I fell asleep during it.

312
00:19:41,476 --> 00:19:45,267
Scott: probably and You just don't want to watch this ever.

313
00:19:45,368 --> 00:19:46,351
Scott: if you see it's notice.

314
00:19:46,391 --> 00:19:48,057
Scott: It's only on VHS not on DVD.

315
00:19:48,117 --> 00:19:48,740
Scott: as far as I know.

316
00:19:50,061 --> 00:19:54,935
Scott: You never want to see Legend of Lemniar LEM NEAR Lemnier.

317
00:19:54,956 --> 00:19:56,319
Rym: Yeah, I mean we're not.

318
00:19:57,303 --> 00:20:00,214
Rym: Some people have said in the forums when we talk about an anime.

319
00:20:00,234 --> 00:20:01,238
Rym: That's not good like.

320
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:02,746
Rym: yeah I watched it cuz.

321
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:04,196
Rym: it sounded like it was so bad.

322
00:20:04,256 --> 00:20:04,699
Rym: It's funny.

323
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:08,951
Rym: We're telling you right now no show we mentioned is worth watching.

324
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:15,213
Rym: like not even for the humor value because there isn't any Watch at your own peril.

325
00:20:15,776 --> 00:20:22,518
Rym: We're not kidding Because Lemnier is definitely not the worst of the bunch of the worst.

326
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:26,592
Scott: no But it is bad enough to be labeled one of the worst anime ever.

327
00:20:26,753 --> 00:20:28,820
Rym: now far closer perhaps the bottom.

328
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:33,880
Rym: Perhaps this is tied with the worst anime down there at the very bottom, but gray the digital target.

329
00:20:34,663 --> 00:20:36,289
Scott: Oh my god great digital tag.

330
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,113
Rym: now if you google.

331
00:20:37,314 --> 00:20:38,900
Scott: I think great deals target is the worst.

332
00:20:39,181 --> 00:20:39,702
Rym: I don't know.

333
00:20:39,983 --> 00:20:41,769
Rym: you haven't actually seen the other one.

334
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:42,632
Rym: We're gonna talk about.

335
00:20:42,732 --> 00:20:43,114
Rym: well.

336
00:20:43,134 --> 00:20:51,172
Scott: I have still My god Let's talk about great digital target all right now if you google for it.

337
00:20:51,513 --> 00:20:53,720
Rym: great the digital target sounds kind of interesting.

338
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:54,703
Scott: Everyone is.

339
00:20:54,763 --> 00:20:58,797
Scott: it's a sci-fi anime movie based on some manga that I never read.

340
00:20:58,997 --> 00:20:59,599
Rym: everyone who?

341
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:09,320
Rym: Reviews it talks about the dystopian future and the the intricate Sociopolitical ramifications of what's going on and these long-glowing reviews, and that is what it's about.

342
00:21:10,024 --> 00:21:10,628
Rym: No, it's not.

343
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,078
Rym: it's about a guy.

344
00:21:12,098 --> 00:21:20,572
Rym: well No, it's a girl who randomly has boobs popping out yeah, and a bunch of fighting Yeah, and then the movie just stops because they ran out of money.

345
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:22,017
Scott: There's the robot with one arm.

346
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,463
Rym: all right There's a scene.

347
00:21:23,503 --> 00:21:25,312
Rym: I mean the animation is so bad.

348
00:21:25,332 --> 00:21:27,120
Rym: There is this robot guy.

349
00:21:27,281 --> 00:21:30,154
Scott: What animation is just a bunch of still shots one after the other.

350
00:21:30,295 --> 00:21:31,159
Rym: who gets so?

351
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,863
Rym: Wounded that eventually.

352
00:21:32,904 --> 00:21:35,814
Rym: he's a torso with a head and one arm.

353
00:21:35,854 --> 00:21:36,557
Scott: He's a robot.

354
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:46,360
Scott: now He's heading one arm right head and one arm one Head a torso a single arm no legs no second arm.

355
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:49,253
Scott: So you have a torso and a head with a single limb.

356
00:21:49,534 --> 00:21:51,484
Rym: now point the first one Appended.

357
00:21:51,564 --> 00:21:57,987
Rym: there is a scene where he climbs a mountain And they show him climbing and he reaches up with the arm And he pulls himself up.

358
00:21:58,249 --> 00:22:04,294
Rym: then he lets it go with the arm Reaches up with the arm and pulls himself up further that this does he holding on with the teeth.

359
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:08,368
Rym: what he's talking in fact While he's climbing that's right now.

360
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:11,679
Rym: This wouldn't be so bad in and of itself.

361
00:22:12,282 --> 00:22:14,855
Rym: Maybe they liked if they didn't actually show him climbing with.

362
00:22:14,915 --> 00:22:15,960
Rym: it's the broken animation.

363
00:22:16,441 --> 00:22:20,173
Rym: But to his climbing this mountain is critical.

364
00:22:20,594 --> 00:22:21,958
Rym: critical to the plot.

365
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,924
Scott: yeah It is now.

366
00:22:24,707 --> 00:22:29,180
Rym: I'm not gonna say that you have to be perfectly realistic in an anime or a movie or anything.

367
00:22:29,643 --> 00:22:32,620
Rym: I mean dragons don't seem to really exist.

368
00:22:32,761 --> 00:22:37,000
Rym: So we can't have a movie about dragons without making up some dragon stuff.

369
00:22:37,803 --> 00:22:41,440
Rym: It's okay to futz with physics a little bit, but good God.

370
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,920
Scott: Yeah, I don't mind it when Lupin's car drives on the wall.

371
00:22:45,442 --> 00:22:57,249
Scott: But if you're gonna have a one armed one headed one torsoed robot Climbing a mountain you got another thing coming now Especially if you're not being all slapstick in whatnot?

372
00:22:57,269 --> 00:22:58,212
Scott: you're being dead serious.

373
00:22:58,232 --> 00:22:59,255
Rym: This movie is serious.

374
00:22:59,475 --> 00:23:00,960
Rym: They are not joking around.

375
00:23:01,181 --> 00:23:01,886
Scott: No, they're not.

376
00:23:02,187 --> 00:23:04,080
Rym: now you think all right that doesn't sound so bad.

377
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,815
Rym: It's kind of long and we're watching and we're not gonna stop watching.

378
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:10,728
Rym: because once we start watching a show We're not gonna stop until we see the end of it.

379
00:23:10,768 --> 00:23:16,618
Rym: unless I fall asleep which often happens Like with that last Lupin movie we watch yeah, I gotta go finish that up.

380
00:23:17,721 --> 00:23:24,553
Rym: But the movie it's moving toward conclusion, and I remember sitting there This is back in college thinking all right this fuckers gonna end.

381
00:23:24,874 --> 00:23:29,119
Rym: I'm gonna find out what happened I'll have closure, and then I'll never speak of it again.

382
00:23:30,126 --> 00:23:30,917
Rym: The movie doesn't end.

383
00:23:31,763 --> 00:23:33,712
Scott: Okay, so just you know the way.

384
00:23:33,772 --> 00:23:34,676
Scott: the plot is.

385
00:23:34,716 --> 00:23:41,500
Scott: this is evil Supercomputer and they want to destroy it because it runs the world and enforces the dystopian society.

386
00:23:42,123 --> 00:23:43,912
Scott: So they want to destroy this evil computer.

387
00:23:44,515 --> 00:23:56,376
Scott: so at the end of the movie They go towards the evil computer to destroy it like they're finally gonna go do it like they're walking over with the guns toward the Horizon like we're gonna go and the movie and you think that you're gonna see.

388
00:23:56,557 --> 00:23:57,320
Scott: after you're ready.

389
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:08,347
Scott: You're gonna see a big fight scene where they run into the giant computer place And they fight robots and they destroy the evil computer and maybe someone dies along the way And then the movie's over.

390
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:10,820
Rym: suddenly the animation stops.

391
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:16,177
Scott: If you don't get to see the action scene on their way over to the tower the animation stops.

392
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:16,920
Rym: it stops.

393
00:24:17,101 --> 00:24:20,345
Rym: It shows the horizon and like their shadows in the distance And then those disappear.

394
00:24:21,008 --> 00:24:35,800
Rym: then text appears over the screen And it says something like five hours later the supercomputer system stopped functioning and then The the image in the background gets kind of wavy like there's an explosion and then the credits roll.

395
00:24:36,462 --> 00:24:42,379
Scott: I think they actually changed the frame to a second picture, which has an explosion on it and play an explosion noise.

396
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:47,350
Rym: I Remember screaming horseshit at the TV and then going to bed.

397
00:24:47,551 --> 00:24:49,897
Scott: I remember everyone was like fuck this shit.

398
00:24:50,058 --> 00:24:50,840
Scott: Oh my god.

399
00:24:51,502 --> 00:24:55,616
Rym: Wow we should have done the juggernaut bitch because now we're just all foul-mouthed today, that's fine.

400
00:24:55,917 --> 00:25:02,810
Scott: the juggernaut bitch Motherfucking gray digital target no motherfucking ending.

401
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:05,380
Rym: what the hell not a goddamn thing you can do about it.

402
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,244
Scott: I got damn thing.

403
00:25:06,787 --> 00:25:09,220
Rym: now Scott hasn't seen the other anime.

404
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:13,279
Rym: That's really down there with gray the digital target, but he's heard about it.

405
00:25:13,681 --> 00:25:16,976
Scott: I heard about it on anime world order where they did a whole episode about it.

406
00:25:17,197 --> 00:25:17,739
Rym: I've seen it.

407
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,427
Rym: I saw the sci-fi channel.

408
00:25:20,547 --> 00:25:22,593
Rym: do it dubbed on TV?

409
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:25,320
Rym: once it is called Odin?

410
00:25:28,203 --> 00:25:35,880
Rym: Yeah, we don't really want to call it Odin because that is disgraceful to Odin the god of various things Vikings with an eyepatch.

411
00:25:37,464 --> 00:25:42,668
Rym: So yeah the reason you call it Odin Is because anime world order did that and you listen?

412
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:42,888
Rym: well

413
00:25:42,928 --> 00:26:01,732
Scott: no no because in the movie Odin one of the voice actors for one girl at one point you know the girl screams Odin in in the movie and the voice actor did it like oh Now then they played that audio clip in the show and I thought it was hilarious.

414
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,055
Rym: this movie is ass.

415
00:26:03,076 --> 00:26:05,984
Rym: it is ass ass ass Ass ass ass ass.

416
00:26:06,205 --> 00:26:06,968
Rym: don't watch it.

417
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,755
Rym: So it's not good.

418
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:15,600
Scott: I'm gonna try to Summarize what I heard on an anime world order and what I remember from listening to it weeks ago.

419
00:26:16,063 --> 00:26:18,420
Scott: But you should go and listen to their episode on Odin.

420
00:26:18,882 --> 00:26:23,920
Scott: Yes, and if you want to know the whole story about this horrible horrible anime because they know every much everything about it.

421
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:28,931
Scott: It's called it's really called Odin something.

422
00:26:29,132 --> 00:26:31,160
Scott: space sailors starlight something.

423
00:26:31,321 --> 00:26:36,017
Rym: Yeah, they got ships that go through space with sails that light something something.

424
00:26:36,057 --> 00:26:36,840
Scott: Yeah, who cares?

425
00:26:38,402 --> 00:26:40,393
Scott: It was it's a very expensive movie.

426
00:26:40,413 --> 00:26:41,780
Scott: They spent a lot of money on it.

427
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,803
Scott: They thought it was going to be the next big thing Whatever.

428
00:26:45,164 --> 00:26:48,916
Scott: Yeah, whoever thought that should dine afire, but all the voice acting suck the anime.

429
00:26:48,996 --> 00:26:50,040
Scott: everything sucked about it.

430
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:55,937
Scott: It was just so so terrible, but then they tried to sell it big time because they spent so much money on it.

431
00:26:55,957 --> 00:27:10,618
Rym: And Yeah, yeah like Gundam f91 was really bad and suffered from the same problems of let's just dump a lot of money into an anime and it'll be Really popular and awesome, but nothing really came quite close to the absolute horror.

432
00:27:10,718 --> 00:27:15,109
Rym: That is Odin Mm-hmm it I can't God.

433
00:27:16,682 --> 00:27:26,140
Scott: Yeah now notables that really aren't on the list But we like to hold out that there's one that should be on the list But we haven't seen so we can't talk about it for more than a few seconds.

434
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,366
Scott: That's Final Fantasy Legend of the Crystal.

435
00:27:28,406 --> 00:27:33,380
Rym: whatever everyone I've ever heard who's all who've seen this show said it was terrible.

436
00:27:33,983 --> 00:27:40,139
Scott: now I the anime club at RIT has the VHS tape and I remember I Saw it once and I was like, huh?

437
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:47,872
Scott: Maybe I should watch that and every single person who had ever seen it or knew anything about it said Do not watch that.

438
00:27:48,013 --> 00:27:50,203
Scott: it is so bad It's not you know, it's.

439
00:27:50,364 --> 00:27:56,160
Scott: it's the worst thing ever and I've never heard a single positive statement about this show from anyone.

440
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:56,642
Rym: You know what?

441
00:27:56,723 --> 00:27:57,869
Rym: I think you're really gonna like it.

442
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,391
Rym: Yeah.

443
00:27:58,793 --> 00:27:59,356
Scott: Yeah.

444
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:04,594
Scott: Yeah, go ahead Go find an old VHS tape of Final Fantasy Legend of the Crystal, whatever it's called.

445
00:28:04,995 --> 00:28:05,236
Scott: Yeah.

446
00:28:05,838 --> 00:28:06,560
Scott: Yeah watch that.

447
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,652
Rym: I dare you the quote from the anime or Expo forums where I was.

448
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,638
Rym: I was going through forums and someone mentioned this.

449
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:15,755
Rym: they said It is physically painful to watch.

450
00:28:15,997 --> 00:28:16,540
Rym: I was nauseous.

451
00:28:18,302 --> 00:28:20,940
Scott: Yeah, so that's a terrible fucking anime.

452
00:28:22,061 --> 00:28:24,488
Rym: Granted Final Fantasy unlimited wasn't much better.

453
00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:28,480
Scott: No if I was in limited was also bad, but it wasn't terrible.

454
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,486
Rym: Yeah, it at least had one redeeming feature.

455
00:28:30,547 --> 00:28:32,653
Rym: Tell that chocobo who would bite the girl's head.

456
00:28:32,673 --> 00:28:33,416
Scott: That's right.

457
00:28:33,657 --> 00:28:35,764
Rym: Oh, oh I like.

458
00:28:35,825 --> 00:28:39,420
Scott: I really like choke and the animation was newer and shinier and not painful.

459
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,102
Rym: Yeah, why couldn't?

460
00:28:40,122 --> 00:28:43,794
Rym: they had just made it like Final Fantasy the chocobo and the cute girl.

461
00:28:44,376 --> 00:28:45,720
Scott: Yeah chocobo the anime.

462
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:46,805
Rym: That'd be freaking great.

463
00:28:46,966 --> 00:28:49,658
Scott: Yeah, they should also have Dragon Warrior the slime the anime.

464
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:52,548
Scott: Oh, no, the slide already has its own game.

465
00:28:52,588 --> 00:28:54,474
Rym: the slime and the chocobo should team up.

466
00:28:54,996 --> 00:28:56,200
Scott: Oh, yeah the other one company.

467
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,165
Scott: They can fucking do that.

468
00:28:57,326 --> 00:28:57,909
Rym: Yeah, and they should.

469
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,175
Scott: I know I'm Chris a lot.

470
00:28:59,195 --> 00:28:59,778
Scott: this episode.

471
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:03,370
Rym: Yeah Yeah, GeekNights is not rated G.

472
00:29:03,511 --> 00:29:04,535
Scott: no, no, it's not.

473
00:29:04,595 --> 00:29:08,796
Scott: it's rated like are But on some days and pg-13 on other days.

474
00:29:08,876 --> 00:29:10,742
Rym: Yeah All right.

475
00:29:11,003 --> 00:29:15,616
Rym: All right now some no other notables that really don't deserve to be on the list even though they're pretty bad.

476
00:29:15,636 --> 00:29:28,308
Scott: the lens man Lensman I think is like it's real close to being on the list and I you know I haven't seen it but from what I've heard from people It's just about as bad as the Final Fantasy.

477
00:29:28,328 --> 00:29:29,351
Scott: so which kind of should be?

478
00:29:29,431 --> 00:29:30,474
Scott: it's just that it.

479
00:29:30,755 --> 00:29:32,943
Rym: it's really maligned it Go.

480
00:29:33,024 --> 00:29:36,400
Rym: it's based on what is supposedly a very good body of science fiction.

481
00:29:36,629 --> 00:29:42,100
Scott: Oh, yeah The books supposedly are like the greatest side or well not the greatest but very good science fiction novels.

482
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,184
Rym: the movie is one of these.

483
00:29:43,224 --> 00:29:55,595
Rym: like it tries to do too much with it and it it goes in all these different directions and It's long and plotting and the end is like typical Mid 80s anime end if that doesn't mean anything to you.

484
00:29:55,735 --> 00:29:56,317
Rym: I'm sorry.

485
00:29:56,437 --> 00:30:09,963
Rym: Yeah, there's Imagine and it just has like a j-poppy early j-rock kind of like music over while the hero like escapes from the exploding thing at the end and this takes several minutes after the Big villain.

486
00:30:10,003 --> 00:30:13,400
Rym: whatever explains whatever existential bullshit the movie was trying to be about.

487
00:30:13,721 --> 00:30:18,940
Scott: The only reason the lens man isn't way down in the worst anime ever is that there are actually some people who like it.

488
00:30:19,322 --> 00:30:21,252
Scott: No one likes the other anime we talked about.

489
00:30:21,574 --> 00:30:22,117
Scott: I know one.

490
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:24,467
Rym: I Like the lens man.

491
00:30:24,487 --> 00:30:27,840
Rym: All right in the same way that I like the game gear.

492
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:43,780
Rym: I grew up with it because you know I first saw anime in fourth grade when the sci-fi channel showed a whole bunch of anime on a Saturday and I watched it all and For about a year after that I watched any anime I could get my hands on and loved it.

493
00:30:44,701 --> 00:30:56,760
Rym: Among that I got a tape of lens man, which was fantastic and I watched it a bunch of times Now that I'm older and wiser and even then there were twinges of like wow, this is really boring.

494
00:30:57,423 --> 00:31:00,998
Rym: Wow, they don't explain anything about that thing that they just used to finish the plot with.

495
00:31:01,018 --> 00:31:05,602
Scott: Wow hmm Let's see.

496
00:31:05,703 --> 00:31:09,179
Scott: Oh, I want to give a special note about robot carnival.

497
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:16,360
Scott: Aha Robot carnival is a collection of short animated features by different people.

498
00:31:16,561 --> 00:31:19,675
Scott: I think there's a katsuhiro tomo thing in there.

499
00:31:19,736 --> 00:31:26,640
Scott: I don't really remember But you know, there's one that's kind of frankenstein II and there's one that's got these people in a balloon.

500
00:31:26,881 --> 00:31:31,660
Rym: This was also shown on that early early, you know when I was in fourth grade sci-fi channel thing, right?

501
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:39,471
Scott: Now the thing about it is some of it has some artistic redeeming value Which is why it's not the absolute worst.

502
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:46,199
Scott: It's not like, you know, the same tier as lens men But most of it is just incredibly painful and useless and terrible.

503
00:31:47,821 --> 00:31:51,360
Rym: Also, I just I thought of this out of the blue kashan robot hunter.

504
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:54,809
Scott: Well, no concern is terrible.

505
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:57,136
Rym: I'm talking about the anime which is worse.

506
00:31:57,297 --> 00:31:58,220
Scott: Is it really that bad?

507
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:11,880
Rym: Oh when I when I found out that that movie that we thought was gonna be awesome from the trailer the live-action was Based on this thing I about cried because I saw this on the sci-fi channel back when I wanted any anime in the world.

508
00:32:11,981 --> 00:32:14,079
Rym: I loved anime and I thought it was stupid.

509
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:15,441
Scott: Wow.

510
00:32:15,703 --> 00:32:19,144
Rym: Yeah, it it's it It's stupid.

511
00:32:19,345 --> 00:32:20,230
Rym: I don't want to get into it.

512
00:32:21,014 --> 00:32:21,979
Rym: Let's not talk about it.

513
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:24,067
Scott: That's a bad anime right there.

514
00:32:24,308 --> 00:32:32,154
Scott: Notice how a lot of the bad animes are old like Any anime that's recent at least has decent enough art.

515
00:32:32,415 --> 00:32:34,260
Scott: art to be not terrible.

516
00:32:35,142 --> 00:32:39,695
Scott: I mean in order to be a really bad anime you have to have no story.

517
00:32:40,036 --> 00:32:40,698
Scott: No art.

518
00:32:40,838 --> 00:32:42,123
Scott: No music No, nothing.

519
00:32:42,204 --> 00:32:48,653
Scott: if there's some anime out there that just have good music and the rest is terrible Those at least are not the worst because they have something good about them.

520
00:32:48,693 --> 00:32:48,854
Rym: Yep.

521
00:32:48,874 --> 00:32:49,557
Rym: They got the music.

522
00:32:49,737 --> 00:32:51,183
Rym: They got the chocobo They got something.

523
00:32:51,463 --> 00:32:51,744
Scott: Yep.

524
00:32:52,246 --> 00:33:02,618
Scott: New animes seem to always have at least some redeeming value Of some such like tactical roar I guess had some mech stuff in it, I guess.

525
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:07,057
Rym: yeah I guess air gear was kind of hilarious because it was so stupid.

526
00:33:07,258 --> 00:33:14,958
Scott: Yep See, but there are absolutely no redeeming qualities to these old old terrible shows because they're just old and terrible.

527
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:23,571
Rym: now I'd like to have a bunch of nods to ass things that more modern or Otherwise good anime have done to put them real close to being on this list.

528
00:33:24,093 --> 00:33:24,875
Rym: My biggest one.

529
00:33:24,935 --> 00:33:26,320
Rym: My biggest gripe is noir.

530
00:33:27,521 --> 00:33:38,986
Rym: Now when we first heard about noir and people have been talking like there's a lot of buzz about it for some reason and it came out and we watched the first episode and only the first episode at anime club and It was awesome.

531
00:33:39,288 --> 00:33:41,160
Rym: Anyone who's seen the first episode of noir?

532
00:33:41,642 --> 00:33:50,760
Rym: It's like this crazy like really neat music Really like cool action scenes and the hint of what could be an awesome plot.

533
00:33:51,505 --> 00:33:58,155
Scott: Yeah, and if you keep watching a few more episodes It's still kind of awesome and the show goes steadily downhill.

534
00:33:58,195 --> 00:33:59,780
Rym: like it gets more and more outrageous.

535
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:02,150
Rym: I mean it goes from like there's the scene.

536
00:34:02,211 --> 00:34:11,927
Rym: everyone who's seen the first episode will remember the one scene Where the girl hangs the guy by the necktie and it's just done really artistically and awesomely by halfway through the show.

537
00:34:12,328 --> 00:34:22,120
Rym: fight scenes basically involve a little girl standing there with two pistols and Standing across from her are like a thousand guys with guns and she kills them all without moving.

538
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:27,339
Rym: Yep, and the end of noir is perhaps the stupidest ending.

539
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:31,280
Rym: Versus it's not the worst thing in any ending attending anime ever.

540
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:41,553
Rym: But compared to how good the first episode of noir was it is probably the greatest disparity in an anime ever Especially since it it was completely separate from what the show was.

541
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:47,119
Scott: I mean they had this dark cool Urban noir action and they should have just stuck with that.

542
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:53,835
Scott: But then a little ways into the show they brought in that Chloe Character and it got all weird and they got all weird and mystical.

543
00:34:53,955 --> 00:35:01,918
Scott: and then at the end of the show They really brought that stuff in and it was like it's like the ending of the show Was nuns with guns.

544
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:11,720
Rym: Literally these nuns come out with these golden pistols and the nuns are like it's time to do what we've always been trained to do And they go out with the guns and they all fight and then nuns with guns.

545
00:35:13,564 --> 00:35:19,779
Scott: It seems like they made two shows one was about nuns and a scary cult and whatever and one was noir.

546
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,461
Scott: and They ended up just taking the ending of one show and sticking it at the end of noir and they threw the ending of noir Away

547
00:35:25,681 --> 00:35:43,696
Rym: plus the end doesn't make sense because the end involves this high priestess woman standing there and she's like you must kill me to become noir and seal your fate as the assassin blah blah blah blah blah and They end up killing her anyway, even though they avoid killing her in this specific situation.

548
00:35:43,716 --> 00:35:47,400
Rym: they kill her a little bit later Yeah, and then they just like literally the end of the movie.

549
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:47,983
Rym: Just they.

550
00:35:48,003 --> 00:35:48,426
Rym: the show is.

551
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:54,076
Rym: they walk away and the police arrived and they're all like We're gonna arrest you and they're like whatever and they walk away and that's the end.

552
00:35:54,096 --> 00:35:56,488
Rym: Mm-hmm It's just it's dumb and there's a lot of a pit.

553
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:00,732
Scott: Oh, yeah, the love bits cool lava pit nuns with guns lives.

554
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:09,128
Scott: Yeah, another thing that a lot of shows do that makes them suck is Fighting god.

555
00:36:09,148 --> 00:36:10,676
Scott: now a fight in a show is cool.

556
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,952
Rym: Everyone loves a good action scene in fact if a fights important enough.

557
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:17,040
Rym: I wouldn't mind if it spanned a couple episodes.

558
00:36:17,382 --> 00:36:30,122
Scott: Yeah, but when you watch a show like rave master was a cute Happy show I was watching just because it was a cute happy show and then I realized that there was a fight that had lasted ten episodes or such Naruto.

559
00:36:30,183 --> 00:36:32,189
Scott: the first few episodes are happy ninja school.

560
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:36,624
Scott: and then there's a fight that lasts ten episodes or such Dragon Ball.

561
00:36:36,885 --> 00:36:39,493
Scott: every fight it lasts ten episodes or such.

562
00:36:39,673 --> 00:36:41,760
Rym: well Dragon Ball Z. Dragon Ball was actually kind of funny.

563
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:50,428
Scott: Yeah, Dragon Ball is it when I'm talking about Dragon Ball Z and GT and GT is even worse, you know, it's okay If you have a plot, that's good.

564
00:36:50,589 --> 00:36:52,196
Scott: If there's a fight that's important to the plot.

565
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:52,919
Scott: That's good.

566
00:36:54,262 --> 00:37:05,039
Scott: If you drag out if the whole substance of your show is just making more episodes By having people come up with techniques and talk about how their technique will counter that technique and love it

567
00:37:05,863 --> 00:37:13,815
Rym: If you do that with real-world things like at least initial D though I'm not saying initial D is highbrow anime at least when they come up with the.

568
00:37:13,996 --> 00:37:15,200
Rym: oh, well, he blah blah blah blah blah.

569
00:37:15,722 --> 00:37:20,558
Rym: It's based on a real thing and the races only last two episodes in.

570
00:37:20,598 --> 00:37:21,180
Rym: like Naruto.

571
00:37:21,481 --> 00:37:24,089
Rym: They whenever they just make shit up like you can just like.

572
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:28,948
Rym: oh, well, I use the special flying puppy magic dagger Puppy puppy.

573
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:30,540
Scott: that's not substance.

574
00:37:30,841 --> 00:37:35,160
Scott: It's just a waste of my time to watch that shit and the shows that so much potential.

575
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,928
Rym: I mean a lot of shows fall into this.

576
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:39,620
Rym: Yu Yu Hakusho was cute and funny and then it turned into crap.

577
00:37:39,761 --> 00:37:44,782
Scott: Yeah, if I watched the first two episodes Yu Yu Hakusho and I was like, oh, that's why people say this show was good No one.

578
00:37:44,883 --> 00:37:47,573
Scott: and then I found out the rest of the show is fighting bleach.

579
00:37:48,215 --> 00:37:48,557
Rym: Awesome.

580
00:37:48,677 --> 00:37:49,621
Rym: Awesome characters Like.

581
00:37:49,762 --> 00:37:52,420
Rym: I really really love the characters and I think the plot is cool.

582
00:37:52,461 --> 00:37:53,676
Scott: I don't like the characters that much.

583
00:37:53,716 --> 00:37:58,132
Scott: the plots Okay, but at the same time what really ruins the show is the fighting.

584
00:37:58,253 --> 00:38:00,058
Rym: it's just they've everyone's fighting and that's all.

585
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:02,329
Scott: the show is Just shown in action.

586
00:38:02,591 --> 00:38:04,260
Scott: like but it's not just shown in action.

587
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,150
Scott: Does there shows that are not in the shown in action genre that just have?

588
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,773
Scott: Useless substance list shallow fight equivalents.

589
00:38:13,355 --> 00:38:23,167
Rym: Yep, or instead of a fight There's the monster a day or item of the day episodic format like Inuyasha Where oh we have to find the thingy.

590
00:38:23,328 --> 00:38:24,090
Rym: Oh, there's the thingy.

591
00:38:24,612 --> 00:38:27,400
Rym: Oh the thingy split into 10 billion pieces.

592
00:38:27,561 --> 00:38:29,855
Rym: We must spend one episode each collecting them all.

593
00:38:30,298 --> 00:38:33,090
Rym: great Cuz I actually like the story of Inuyasha.

594
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,114
Rym: I think it's a good story.

595
00:38:34,134 --> 00:38:35,178
Rym: I like the characters.

596
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:36,463
Scott: man I like it so much.

597
00:38:36,824 --> 00:38:43,459
Rym: the problem is for every one minute of character development and plot I get 29 minutes of bullshit.

598
00:38:44,881 --> 00:38:52,526
Scott: yep, another thing a lot of animes do that's bad is Take two different genres and stick them together.

599
00:38:52,546 --> 00:38:55,874
Scott: a good example of this is Full metal panic.

600
00:38:55,894 --> 00:39:06,227
Scott: full metal panic could have been a really good show because the robot half of it with the Story about the war and whatnot was actually kind of good and I watched the whole first season just for that

601
00:39:06,628 --> 00:39:11,667
Rym: and by the same Token, the other half the funny school military hijinks half was

602
00:39:11,728 --> 00:39:12,310
Scott: pretty funny.

603
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:17,970
Scott: Yeah, the you know, there are a lot of school hijinks shows and they're good and bad.

604
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:23,970
Scott: But this one was you know, slightly above average sticking them together Subtracted from both of them.

605
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:27,319
Scott: I Think that that's really the point of full metal panic.

606
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:32,600
Scott: So it's kind of silly to say to take it out, but full metal panic would have been better is two separate shows.

607
00:39:33,001 --> 00:39:40,360
Rym: I think it suffers from the fact that the military part was too serious and cool and the other part was just too silly.

608
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,605
Rym: So there's too much disparity.

609
00:39:41,886 --> 00:39:45,220
Rym: You can't jump back and forth between emotions that quickly or it ruins the effect.

610
00:39:45,723 --> 00:39:54,298
Scott: Yeah, I think plus earlier in the show There's a lot more school and later in the show those a lot more military which kind of helped it a little bit Which is how I was able to finish the show.

611
00:39:55,341 --> 00:40:06,340
Scott: but yeah the school should have been a little less happy and the military should have been a little less serious because The military plot really wasn't deep enough to hold up to its seriousness.

612
00:40:07,801 --> 00:40:15,159
Rym: Now here's a specific gripe about a specific show and series and franchise that frankly they should have let it die a long time ago.

613
00:40:15,841 --> 00:40:20,778
Rym: Tenshi Muyo it the original Tenshi Muyo the TV and the OAV.

614
00:40:20,798 --> 00:40:25,240
Scott: in the first movie I really like I kind of sort of invented the harem show.

615
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:31,432
Scott: Yeah, but harem shows are bad But at the same time at least inventing any genre.

616
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:32,195
Rym: and it did it.

617
00:40:32,255 --> 00:40:33,860
Rym: Well, the show is funny and heartwarming.

618
00:40:33,981 --> 00:40:34,809
Rym: I like the characters.

619
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:35,900
Rym: I really enjoy Tenshi.

620
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:37,827
Rym: Now for some reason.

621
00:40:37,847 --> 00:40:38,612
Rym: well not for some reason.

622
00:40:38,652 --> 00:40:39,980
Rym: it's obvious why they did it money.

623
00:40:40,826 --> 00:40:45,510
Rym: But they made another movie and Alright, this movie is kind of a but it's not so bad.

624
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,413
Rym: It's short whatever.

625
00:40:46,433 --> 00:40:51,219
Rym: and they made another movie Which was basically just doujinshi fan service porn.

626
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:57,300
Rym: Then they made Tenshi GXP, which is one of the worst travesties to everyone about Tokyo one.

627
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:00,734
Rym: And then and before the OAVs there were the first two.

628
00:41:00,754 --> 00:41:05,475
Rym: the first OAV is awesome Except at the end when they pull this thing where they come out.

629
00:41:05,515 --> 00:41:06,360
Rym: They're like the last episode.

630
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,660
Rym: They're like, here's a million million million million plot things that will never resolve, huh?

631
00:41:11,841 --> 00:41:16,600
Rym: And then they decided to make another OAV and try to explain all that crap and that's not a good idea.

632
00:41:18,481 --> 00:41:21,611
Rym: Tenshi in Tokyo was self-indulgent indulgent crap.

633
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:24,440
Rym: It just went nowhere and it was just a money grab.

634
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:26,146
Rym: It was also kind of poorly animated.

635
00:41:26,668 --> 00:41:26,929
Scott: Uh-huh.

636
00:41:27,411 --> 00:41:29,538
Rym: The third movie is like terrible terrible.

637
00:41:29,558 --> 00:41:31,767
Rym: terrible though It's worth watching because it has one funny thing.

638
00:41:31,807 --> 00:41:33,052
Rym: That's not intentionally funny.

639
00:41:33,072 --> 00:41:36,440
Rym: Mm-hmm when the grandpa I'll ruin the movie.

640
00:41:36,842 --> 00:41:42,379
Rym: There's this tree and the grandpa's got to kill the tree because the tree is a thing An axe an axe that'll kill the tree.

641
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,596
Rym: No, he goes and gets his lightsaber a lightsaber to kill a tree.

642
00:41:45,616 --> 00:41:47,083
Scott: when he's an axe Well, he has this.

643
00:41:47,364 --> 00:41:48,349
Rym: don't get me started.

644
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:50,680
Rym: So he walks over to the tree and the tree's name is Haruna.

645
00:41:51,082 --> 00:41:53,675
Scott: All right, I'm done with this and he'd like he knew the trees.

646
00:41:53,916 --> 00:41:54,680
Rym: It's a long story.

647
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,064
Rym: It's kind of.

648
00:41:55,104 --> 00:41:56,740
Rym: it would have been really cool if they'd done it differently.

649
00:41:57,461 --> 00:42:02,640
Rym: He takes his little sword and he screams her name like harder to and he starts stabs into the tree.

650
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,959
Rym: All right, and then it cuts away and I'm like, oh we had to kill the tree.

651
00:42:06,361 --> 00:42:07,366
Rym: Oh how poignant.

652
00:42:08,189 --> 00:42:09,274
Rym: and the show keeps going for a while.

653
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:10,679
Rym: it cuts back to him.

654
00:42:11,122 --> 00:42:14,000
Rym: He's still cutting through the tree and he's still screaming Haruna.

655
00:42:15,061 --> 00:42:17,809
Rym: It cuts back to other action minutes later.

656
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:18,953
Rym: It cuts back to him again.

657
00:42:19,254 --> 00:42:21,340
Rym: He's still cutting through the tree and he's still screaming Haruna.

658
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,149
Rym: Alrighty then it's just silly.

659
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:26,939
Scott: that sounds pretty silly to me.

660
00:42:27,542 --> 00:42:35,611
Rym: plus the movie plays out as though someone wrote a doujinshi where They wrote themselves into the tenchi universe in order to have sex with tenchi.

661
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:38,620
Rym: Wow, the movie like the movie is painful to watch.

662
00:42:39,461 --> 00:42:43,415
Scott: Okay, let's talk about tenchi GXP, which I saw the first four episodes of.

663
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:46,200
Rym: sadly first off This has nothing to do with tenchi.

664
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:51,499
Rym: They put the name on it and they put the characters in the background to try to make it popular kind of like Gundam see destiny.

665
00:42:52,181 --> 00:42:55,900
Scott: Well, no Gundam see the gun as he does needs a different story actually.

666
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:05,160
Rym: Yeah, well, they start bringing the main characters back apparently more and more and having and then they become the main characters of the new Show, yeah GXP is like a show that has nothing to do with tenchi.

667
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,753
Rym: But then see that thing that just went by in the back.

668
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,040
Scott: What's the show that everyone knows?

669
00:43:09,961 --> 00:43:11,760
Scott: I guess Naruto or everyone knows Naruto.

670
00:43:11,921 --> 00:43:21,080
Scott: Imagine if I made Naruto XP and all the characters from the original Naruto were in it But they were never actually in the foreground.

671
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:27,040
Scott: You might see them in the background like just let you know like hiding around like if you're playing an RPG.

672
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,117
Scott: They would be the townsfolk that you can't actually talk to like.

673
00:43:31,137 --> 00:43:36,342
Rym: you'll see Kakashi just like sitting in a chair as the characters walk by and they don't interact at all And then he's gone.

674
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:42,224
Scott: and you'll see Naruto like jump from one roof to another but you'll never talk to him and he'll never do Anything in the story.

675
00:43:42,284 --> 00:43:51,007
Scott: and it's all about some other characters just who happen to be in the same world Where the characters that you used to know and love still exist But they have nothing to do with it.

676
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:52,292
Rym: now that alone wouldn't be so bad.

677
00:43:52,353 --> 00:43:54,120
Rym: But the show itself is just ass.

678
00:43:54,601 --> 00:43:59,980
Scott: Yeah, tenchi GXP is ass ass ass ass and all the characters in the original tenchi are in the background.

679
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:03,240
Rym: Now we didn't put this in the worst list.

680
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,866
Scott: Oh tenchi muyo GXP.

681
00:44:04,887 --> 00:44:11,252
Rym: the reason it's not on the worst list is because the opening I was about to say Nobody's not on the worst list is that the opening song is cool.

682
00:44:11,392 --> 00:44:13,260
Scott: The opening song is really cool and you have something.

683
00:44:14,906 --> 00:44:16,440
Scott: If you have an opening song that's cool.

684
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,007
Scott: You're not the worst anime because they're anime.

685
00:44:19,027 --> 00:44:21,815
Scott: they don't have cool opening songs and they're worser.

686
00:44:22,156 --> 00:44:24,538
Scott: Yeah worser worser That's what they are worser.

687
00:44:27,401 --> 00:44:29,307
Rym: Now harem shows are generally bad.

688
00:44:29,909 --> 00:44:31,373
Rym: I don't like love Hina.

689
00:44:31,654 --> 00:44:33,480
Rym: it's too close to pedophilia for me.

690
00:44:33,761 --> 00:44:37,875
Scott: I actually watched way back in the day the whole first season of love Hina.

691
00:44:38,337 --> 00:44:40,565
Scott: Oh my god You know why I watched it.

692
00:44:40,946 --> 00:44:41,287
Rym: turtles.

693
00:44:41,468 --> 00:44:43,596
Scott: I was waiting for the goddamn turtles to show up.

694
00:44:43,757 --> 00:44:45,768
Rym: the turtles are awesome But that's all that show has.

695
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:46,453
Scott: all the show has.

696
00:44:46,514 --> 00:44:47,300
Scott: it's why it's not worst.

697
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:51,038
Rym: It has a turtle like tenchi was a harem show, but it was also clever and funny.

698
00:44:51,921 --> 00:44:53,285
Rym: Love Hina wasn't clever.

699
00:44:53,626 --> 00:45:01,546
Scott: It was always the same thing and he accidentally being perverted getting hit Accidentally being perverted getting hit.

700
00:45:01,847 --> 00:45:02,148
Rym: Yep.

701
00:45:02,429 --> 00:45:03,431
Scott: That's the whole show.

702
00:45:03,732 --> 00:45:06,560
Rym: get close to a different girl depending on which episode it is.

703
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,280
Rym: There's a different kind of girl for every kind of scary fanboy.

704
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:13,099
Scott: It's still the main girl that everyone loves and you get with her in the end.

705
00:45:14,492 --> 00:45:16,217
Rym: Yeah, how do people watch this crap?

706
00:45:16,437 --> 00:45:17,360
Scott: because they're perverted.

707
00:45:20,401 --> 00:45:22,084
Scott: They're otaku who can't get any women.

708
00:45:22,124 --> 00:45:24,609
Scott: so they need to fantasize about some anime woman.

709
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:38,807
Scott: and Since you can't have a different and it's cheaper to make one anime with a woman for every guy Than it is to make eight anime with one each one having the girl for each type of guy Now it is a equal opportunity.

710
00:45:38,847 --> 00:45:46,731
Rym: I mean, it's not just for scary fanboys because there's the show out now mine liebe Which is just the same kind of harem show only for girls.

711
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:47,715
Rym: It's all these pretty boys.

712
00:45:48,056 --> 00:45:48,417
Rym: Yep.

713
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:49,581
Scott: Yep Yep.

714
00:45:49,802 --> 00:45:56,845
Scott: Now notice how we haven't mentioned any actual hentai or actual, you know rated X Yeah, we or Yuri.

715
00:45:56,865 --> 00:45:58,190
Rym: We haven't seen any of that crap.

716
00:45:58,471 --> 00:45:59,877
Scott: Yeah, cuz we're not perverted.

717
00:45:59,917 --> 00:46:01,865
Scott: We don't watch Porn anime.

718
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:08,735
Scott: I mean if I'm gonna look at porn I live real porn first of all and second of all I'm not gonna watch something that has the facade of a plot.

719
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,536
Rym: I Saw part of the blue girl at a con.

720
00:46:12,919 --> 00:46:22,100
Scott: Yeah I think if you're if you're not perverted and you say the only hentai you've seen is the blue girl and you never watch anymore You okay, actually you can watch cutie, honey.

721
00:46:22,281 --> 00:46:25,034
Scott: Also, but any more than that and that's no good.

722
00:46:25,577 --> 00:46:26,160
Rym: now there are a lot.

723
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,705
Rym: I mean, there are some shows that aren't.

724
00:46:28,428 --> 00:46:29,692
Rym: I watched elven bride.

725
00:46:29,712 --> 00:46:31,860
Rym: Yeah, and it's actually kind of funny.

726
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:32,642
Scott: That's a cut.

727
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,987
Scott: it's an erotic comedy.

728
00:46:34,007 --> 00:46:37,357
Scott: Yes, like sanctuary the manga is an erotic thriller.

729
00:46:37,438 --> 00:46:38,160
Rym: Yeah build as such.

730
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:44,460
Scott: It's a political erotic thriller, but and it has some nakedness and some sex and stuff, but it's not a porno.

731
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,825
Scott: It's mostly about the plot.

732
00:46:45,865 --> 00:46:47,310
Scott: It's just the plot.

733
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:49,860
Scott: has people having sex and when they do they show it.

734
00:46:50,101 --> 00:46:52,553
Rym: Yeah, I mean how the bride is actually really kind of funny.

735
00:46:52,593 --> 00:46:55,768
Rym: It's just a. it's a Sex comedy basically.

736
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:57,817
Scott: Yeah, imagine like dancing penises.

737
00:46:57,878 --> 00:47:01,322
Rym: and happy What Dancing penises?

738
00:47:01,342 --> 00:47:01,543
Rym: a?

739
00:47:01,924 --> 00:47:07,440
Rym: no they are not in because well mostly because Japanese law and such they couldn't show genitalia.

740
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:10,415
Scott: Yeah, but you know what an anime with dancing penises.

741
00:47:10,436 --> 00:47:15,440
Rym: be high Larry's You know, we could go to the city and see puppetry of the penis.

742
00:47:15,902 --> 00:47:17,128
Scott: You don't want to actually see that.

743
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:18,394
Rym: I saw a video of much of it.

744
00:47:18,716 --> 00:47:19,640
Scott: That's all you need to say.

745
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:22,980
Scott: It's actually really funny, but it is really funny, but it's you don't want to pay for it.

746
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:23,462
Scott: No one see it.

747
00:47:23,523 --> 00:47:26,860
Scott: live that true unless you're you know into that sort of thing.

748
00:47:29,593 --> 00:47:32,150
Rym: But actually the other thing about hentai is it's fun to mock.

749
00:47:32,473 --> 00:47:34,129
Rym: We've never actually been to it.

750
00:47:34,471 --> 00:47:40,590
Rym: But there's this like Dave and Buster's hint funny hentai dubbing the dick and Buster's David Buster's is an arcade slash restaurant.

751
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:45,870
Rym: Yeah dick and we never actually end up going to it because it's always either full or we have better things to do at cons.

752
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:48,518
Rym: But many people have told us it's hilarious.

753
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,045
Scott: I don't doubt them that it's hilarious.

754
00:47:51,065 --> 00:48:09,390
Scott: You know, it seems like I Can't really tell what's going on in the anime community with all this hentai stuff because I can't tell if there are a large number of perverts who I should shun and throw out the window or Are there a large number of people who just really enjoy?

755
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:17,070
Scott: Using hentai as a tool for humor or is it a combination of the two and which side is more heavily favored?

756
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:18,254
Rym: It's a combination.

757
00:48:18,314 --> 00:48:19,238
Rym: where mo?

758
00:48:19,298 --> 00:48:24,509
Rym: I think many of the people who are very open about liking hentai Very much like it for ironic or comedic value.

759
00:48:25,252 --> 00:48:30,372
Rym: But I think there are a lot of people who like who say they like it for that but actually like it because it arouses them.

760
00:48:30,392 --> 00:48:32,333
Scott: I Think so, too.

761
00:48:32,736 --> 00:48:41,166
Scott: I think the majority say it's 75% You know arousal perverts and 25% Probably with the just humor.

762
00:48:41,609 --> 00:48:51,650
Rym: Yeah There's also the whole yaoi thing among young girls, which seems to be more of a cultural identity than an actual fetish or sexual proclivity.

763
00:48:52,492 --> 00:48:53,358
Scott: Yeah, you don't see.

764
00:48:53,378 --> 00:48:59,530
Scott: I mean at least I don't see You know girls actually getting off on yaoi.

765
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:03,202
Scott: Well, like in a in a porn sort of way.

766
00:49:03,483 --> 00:49:04,025
Rym: What do you mean?

767
00:49:04,086 --> 00:49:04,990
Rym: Where would you see that?

768
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:07,362
Rym: Where would you have the opportunity to see that?

769
00:49:07,382 --> 00:49:09,802
Scott: I Don't know but I need to find out.

770
00:49:14,012 --> 00:49:16,580
Rym: I Think we're about done here are we?

771
00:49:17,344 --> 00:49:17,766
Rym: it's all right.

772
00:49:17,786 --> 00:49:18,650
Rym: We got to play Mario.

773
00:49:19,071 --> 00:49:25,610
Rym: I've the box I just the box is sitting right next to my microphone and I've been staring at it for the whole episode.

774
00:49:25,751 --> 00:49:29,046
Rym: Good job thinking about what I'm going to do in the game.

775
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:32,639
Scott: No All right, let's see what else.

776
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:36,295
Scott: is there anything else that makes an anime really terrible beside Bad?

777
00:49:36,335 --> 00:49:44,130
Scott: voice acting always makes it terrible Yeah, but you usually get around that by watching the subs or the dubs, you know, vice-versa.

778
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:46,399
Scott: Sometimes the Japanese voice acting is terrible.

779
00:49:46,620 --> 00:50:01,110
Rym: Yeah, I this is not a popular opinion But I contend that the American voice acting in the original dub of erasera to beautiful dreamer Which is one of my favorite movies ever is better than the original Japanese voice acting.

780
00:50:01,271 --> 00:50:14,950
Rym: Maybe that's just because you're used to the English But at the same time I've seen them both several times and I think they did a good job with the dub except for one Screwed up part, but that's like how Penn doesn't like Isaac Hayes words and shaft whatever.

781
00:50:16,271 --> 00:50:21,810
Scott: Yeah, of course, you know animation glitches bad animation lack of animation.

782
00:50:22,254 --> 00:50:38,630
Scott: I mean, I'm not a stickler for art but if if you're as bad as say the original transformer series with its glitches of animation or If you're like utana where you have lots and lots of still frames and you just pan across them with the camera.

783
00:50:38,872 --> 00:50:40,650
Rym: Yeah, at least utana had an excuse.

784
00:50:40,891 --> 00:50:48,596
Rym: They had no money and a lot of plot and the fact that the show is good Despite the fact that they had no money to animate it says a lot It does like.

785
00:50:48,657 --> 00:50:51,093
Rym: that show probably would have been much more Popular.

786
00:50:51,153 --> 00:50:54,730
Scott: it would much worse if they had more money because it would more like the movie.

787
00:50:54,971 --> 00:50:58,225
Rym: No, not not because the movie was mostly kuhara's doing.

788
00:50:58,867 --> 00:50:59,470
Scott: that's the point.

789
00:50:59,591 --> 00:50:59,872
Rym: There was.

790
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:03,367
Scott: no there wasn't so much Chiyo Saito saying hey, you can't do that to my character.

791
00:51:03,387 --> 00:51:04,597
Scott: Yeah, that's her name I remember.

792
00:51:04,759 --> 00:51:05,530
Rym: Yeah, she's awesome.

793
00:51:06,491 --> 00:51:06,852
Scott: Yeah.

794
00:51:07,434 --> 00:51:08,920
Scott: Hey, let me make this great manga.

795
00:51:09,181 --> 00:51:11,269
Scott: Hey, the scary guy is sitting outside my house.

796
00:51:12,451 --> 00:51:13,274
Scott: What does he want?

797
00:51:13,635 --> 00:51:15,281
Scott: He wants to make an anime of my manga?

798
00:51:15,562 --> 00:51:17,670
Scott: No, he's a scary guy who sits outside my house.

799
00:51:18,293 --> 00:51:20,063
Scott: He's been there for a week fine.

800
00:51:20,083 --> 00:51:24,345
Scott: You can make the goddamn anime But I'm gonna make sure you don't make anything.

801
00:51:24,365 --> 00:51:25,229
Scott: perverted you sicko.

802
00:51:25,711 --> 00:51:27,519
Rym: I think the two of them really worked.

803
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:34,563
Rym: Well because I the manga is mostly Chiyo Saito and The show is like a mix between the two and the movie is purely kuhara.

804
00:51:35,105 --> 00:51:39,259
Rym: The movie is crazy Cornish crap because he kuhara is a scary dude.

805
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:45,779
Rym: The manga is good and cute, but it's a normal Jojo, it lacks a certain something you need.

806
00:51:45,799 --> 00:51:51,669
Rym: like Ikuhara added the edge to the anime that made it Just one of my staples one of my favorite shows ever.

807
00:51:52,091 --> 00:51:58,210
Scott: Yeah, the manga on its own might as well just be any other shoujo manga with somewhat magical girl whatnots.

808
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:01,024
Scott: But the TV show is something else.

809
00:52:01,265 --> 00:52:10,140
Rym: once you add Ikuhara's whoa to it I guess it says you gotta have a little bit of that to make a show good a little bit of edge a little bit Of something a little bit of crazy guy.

810
00:52:10,301 --> 00:52:15,161
Scott: Yeah, but that's what you need to be a good anime Not what you don't need to not be a bad one.

811
00:52:15,462 --> 00:52:17,710
Rym: Don't do what Donnie don't does.

812
00:52:19,596 --> 00:52:20,251
Scott: That's Right.

813
00:52:20,612 --> 00:52:20,853
Rym: All right.

814
00:52:20,873 --> 00:52:21,917
Rym: I think we're actually done.

815
00:52:21,937 --> 00:52:23,201
Scott: All right, cool.

816
00:52:23,603 --> 00:52:23,804
Rym: Yep.

817
00:52:23,824 --> 00:52:24,205
Rym: Tomorrow.

818
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:28,093
Rym: We'll be talking about the worst people Throughout history.

819
00:52:28,474 --> 00:52:29,175
Scott: Oh my god.

820
00:52:29,196 --> 00:52:30,619
Scott: Yeah, we're not gonna.

821
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:35,313
Scott: we're gonna avoid people who everyone knows about like Hitler and Stalin and stick to the People you don't know.

822
00:52:35,434 --> 00:52:39,810
Rym: Yeah, I mean it's not gonna be a comprehensive list because there are a lot of people out there who sucked.

823
00:52:40,071 --> 00:52:42,120
Scott: Oh god, there are so many bad dudes.

824
00:52:42,321 --> 00:52:48,570
Rym: It's mostly gonna be us talking about obscure guys You might not realize how bad they were and explaining why they're bad and why you should hate them.

825
00:52:48,851 --> 00:52:51,848
Rym: One of them has a theme song that I'm going to play a little bit of.

826
00:52:54,231 --> 00:52:59,790
Rym: Now we decided against doing the worst people we currently know or we've known in our lives.

827
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:02,545
Scott: That's more of a hate first of all, but we don't really hate.

828
00:53:02,686 --> 00:53:03,369
Scott: I guess I don't know.

829
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:06,625
Rym: No, no, cuz some of these people I would submit are objectively bad.

830
00:53:06,866 --> 00:53:09,658
Rym: Yeah, I'll note that We don't really know any of those people anymore.

831
00:53:09,739 --> 00:53:10,321
Scott: No, we don't.

832
00:53:10,663 --> 00:53:12,350
Rym: we just hear stories about used to know them.

833
00:53:13,391 --> 00:53:16,646
Rym: Yeah, of course we wondered what do we do if those people listen to the show?

834
00:53:16,706 --> 00:53:19,263
Rym: and then we remembered Oh, we won't care and we'll laugh.

835
00:53:19,585 --> 00:53:20,250
Scott: That's right.

836
00:53:22,535 --> 00:53:24,550
Scott: I laugh at you and your miserable existence.

837
00:53:26,191 --> 00:53:28,278
Rym: Your music's bad and you should fail bad.

838
00:53:28,298 --> 00:53:28,518
Scott: Yep.

839
00:53:28,558 --> 00:53:38,570
Scott: So if anyone noticed, you know in worst week we did with the worst Hardware gadgets the worst game consoles and the video game consoles and the worst anime.

840
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:55,870
Scott: That means at some point in the future we can have worst weeks two and possibly even three where we do stuff like worst Softwares or yeah worst Worst comics worst comics worst manga or video game worst board games.

841
00:53:56,151 --> 00:53:57,615
Rym: So god, there's only one Hellas.

842
00:53:57,956 --> 00:53:59,039
Scott: Yeah, there are other ones.

843
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,286
Rym: Yeah, but we were smart enough to avoid Monopoly.

844
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:02,149
Scott: Yeah, Monopoly.

845
00:54:02,209 --> 00:54:12,870
Scott: Okay Yeah, so This might not be the last worst week But this another worst week won't come for a very long time months, perhaps even a year.

846
00:54:13,211 --> 00:54:16,870
Rym: I tried to come up with a joke about bratwurst, but it just didn't come.

847
00:54:19,254 --> 00:54:20,083
Scott: The worst worst.

00:54:20,103 --> 00:54:22,674

Scott: Okay.

Rym: I think we're done.

00:54:25,663 --> 00:54:26,767
Scott: You've said that like three times.
