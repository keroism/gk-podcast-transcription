8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,311
Rym: I've seen a whole bunch of movies, but you're not watching movies anymore.

9
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,599
Rym: I've seen a whole bunch of these to see.

10
00:00:34,864 --> 00:00:38,877
Rym: No, none at all Not even like movies that are already on Netflix.

11
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:41,006
Scott: nothing Netflix right now.

12
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,460
Rym: Oh, see I dropped the Hulu.

13
00:00:43,802 --> 00:00:46,714
Rym: I did that too because there's nothing on Hulu that I want to watch it.

14
00:00:47,016 --> 00:00:47,699
Scott: I dropped everything.

15
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:48,623
Scott: right now There's nothing to watch.

16
00:00:49,246 --> 00:00:51,798
Rym: I still got the c-roll because I'm watching anime and I still got the Netflix.

17
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:52,320
Rym: cuz I'm watching.

18
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,911
Scott: I watched all the animes in the c-roll.

19
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:55,099
Scott: I'm waiting for more to show up.

20
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:58,329
Rym: Uh, so you didn't watch any hero academia, whatever.

21
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,135
Rym: No, no, cuz that's the show.

22
00:01:00,195 --> 00:01:00,757
Rym: I was gonna watch.

23
00:01:00,777 --> 00:01:01,459
Rym: talk about it.

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,232
Rym: All right, it's not watching stuff not doing stuff.

25
00:01:05,694 --> 00:01:10,306
Rym: so what's your Thursday show on Nothing, I haven't seen anything.

26
00:01:10,347 --> 00:01:11,210
Scott: Let's not do.

27
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,313
Rym: I just saw Kubo.

28
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,240
Rym: I just saw Ghostbusters not that long ago.

29
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,064
Rym: It was actually really good.

30
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:17,495
Rym: Yeah, like real funny real legit.

31
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:23,430
Rym: I'd say Three times funnier than Ghostbusters - maybe four times funnier.

32
00:01:23,932 --> 00:01:24,333
Rym: and like.

33
00:01:24,373 --> 00:01:27,280
Scott: that's like saying I got four pennies four times more money.

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,300
Rym: Yeah, but 90% as funny as the first Ghostbusters like it's right under there.

35
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,511
Scott: You're saying that the second Ghostbusters is only 25% of the second one.

36
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:39,096
Rym: There's the second Ghostbusters movie.

37
00:01:39,637 --> 00:01:40,640
Rym: Not that good.

38
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:41,923
Scott: No, I'm saying is you're?

39
00:01:42,023 --> 00:01:43,768
Scott: you're saying you're you're you're.

40
00:01:44,089 --> 00:01:48,682
Scott: basically the numbers you just used rate the second Ghostbusters movie much too Highly.

41
00:01:48,923 --> 00:01:49,205
Rym: All right.

42
00:01:49,225 --> 00:01:50,873
Rym: So let's take comedy movies as a whole.

43
00:01:50,913 --> 00:01:52,239
Rym: What was the last good comedy movie?

44
00:01:53,660 --> 00:02:00,882
Rym: That you can think of name a good comedy movie Ever?

45
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:03,028
Rym: young Frankenstein young Frankenstein.

46
00:02:03,048 --> 00:02:04,672
Rym: Where's the last time you saw young Frankenstein?

47
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:05,976
Scott: a year ago.

48
00:02:06,297 --> 00:02:06,858
Rym: Did it hold up?

49
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:14,340
Rym: Yes All right, cuz I got a. I watch like 20 minutes of space balls about a month ago does not hold up that movie.

50
00:02:15,023 --> 00:02:16,872
Rym: Not even at all funny.

51
00:02:17,174 --> 00:02:17,616
Rym: I'm sorry.

52
00:02:17,656 --> 00:02:18,400
Rym: That movie is funny.

53
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,967
Rym: I guess if the internet didn't exist.

54
00:02:20,128 --> 00:02:25,708
Scott: Mel Brooks always had the lowbrow but his Cleverness decreased over the time.

55
00:02:25,788 --> 00:02:33,393
Rym: it's you know what it is because even I'm gonna be honest I think blazing saddles holds up a little better, but not that much better.

56
00:02:33,413 --> 00:02:35,600
Scott: cuz aging saddles holds up significantly better.

57
00:02:35,661 --> 00:02:45,848
Rym: Yeah but the one I have not seen in my adult life to be able to say the score on his men in tights and I have This worry that it doesn't hold up at all.

58
00:02:45,868 --> 00:02:48,357
Scott: There's only a few jokes in it that hold up and the rest do not.

59
00:02:48,558 --> 00:03:01,424
Rym: yeah But I think of it a lot like I think of the far side where the far side Was some of the funniest shit I'd ever read in a day before the internet existed and all these modern comedy things existed.

60
00:03:01,465 --> 00:03:11,579
Rym: the far side was relatively avant-garde compared to anything else you see in a newspaper and Nowadays, like if far side had never existed and it started today.

61
00:03:12,362 --> 00:03:15,280
Rym: And let's even assume that nothing that was inspired by the far side existed.

62
00:03:16,023 --> 00:03:17,832
Rym: It wouldn't even get a read like.

63
00:03:17,873 --> 00:03:19,702
Rym: it wouldn't even just be there It was.

64
00:03:19,722 --> 00:03:22,320
Rym: there was a time and a place that comic could exist and it's long gone.

65
00:03:22,944 --> 00:03:25,020
Rym: I feel like a lot of Mel Brooks stuff is like that.

66
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:33,106
Rym: Like it just cannot compete with modern comedy and it's notable only for the relative Pioneering that it did in its era.

67
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:40,579
Scott: I think if you look at history as a whole right history of modern media Those things are like that going back to the 20th century.

68
00:03:41,122 --> 00:03:53,720
Scott: The comedy sort of has these, you know big sine wave right whereas like there are time periods Where a comedy was like at its peak and all the comedy from that era at least the top tier stuff holds up forever.

69
00:03:54,002 --> 00:03:56,680
Rym: Like, you know if you go I wouldn't say all the comedy.

70
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,780
Rym: I think it's partly the anime import syndrome of like not like early 90s stand-up.

71
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,367
Rym: There was a lot of really good stand-up like.

72
00:04:03,427 --> 00:04:06,158
Rym: I remember this era of like amazing stand-up in late 80s, too.

73
00:04:06,762 --> 00:04:19,432
Scott: but that's just because everyone forgot about All the other stand-up comics that weren't on HBO specials bones, okay, so if you go back right go back to Marx Brothers, right that shit lasts forever.

74
00:04:19,452 --> 00:04:20,095
Scott: Uh, so

75
00:04:20,115 --> 00:04:37,976
Rym: a lot of their like their movies not actually great to a modern sensibility unless you have some nostalgia toward them or are particularly looking forward to that particular kind of mostly set piece prop style comedy

76
00:04:38,357 --> 00:04:47,832
Scott: anyway, so Then after that, there's like a time period where shit ain't funny Until like Jerry Lewis like a bit later, right then shits funny again.

77
00:04:48,093 --> 00:04:50,440
Rym: Is it if you what's the last time you watch the Jerry Lewis movie?

78
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,245
Scott: Long time ago.

79
00:04:52,346 --> 00:04:52,648
Scott: Yeah.

80
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:57,051
Rym: Anyway, I just worry watching Jerry Lewis movie right now.

81
00:04:57,593 --> 00:04:58,659
Rym: We're both gonna be like.

82
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,488
Scott: I won't say it's impossible.

83
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,563
Rym: Yeah, I won't say it's a hundred percent though I don't have right.

84
00:05:04,744 --> 00:05:07,535
Rym: it's very for kid brain to not remember stuff right.

85
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:08,640
Scott: then shit goes downhill again.

86
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:10,245
Scott: But then it comes back.

87
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,951
Scott: it comes back in the 80s.

88
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:12,955
Scott: you get some Eddie Murphy.

89
00:05:12,975 --> 00:05:17,412
Scott: you get you know This is our SNL golden age kind of action going on.

90
00:05:17,492 --> 00:05:20,524
Rym: Right, you know, yeah, but at the same time So SNL.

91
00:05:20,544 --> 00:05:22,392
Rym: when I was younger, I had this like.

92
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:30,760
Rym: I remembered SNL being the most Ridiculously funny, but it was partly because I was only ever watching the best of that's what I'm saying.

93
00:05:31,101 --> 00:05:31,442
Rym: But then II.

94
00:05:31,482 --> 00:05:36,780
Rym: but the problem is it's just that I think the best of of almost any era is gonna be pretty great.

95
00:05:37,142 --> 00:05:48,999
Scott: No, it's like the best of in like, you know An era that sucks is like not even close to what's an era that sucks Like what's a year that sucks anything between the year?

96
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:51,087
Scott: 2000 and today?

97
00:05:51,108 --> 00:05:54,770
Rym: all right comedy movies 2000 I don't know.

98
00:05:55,295 --> 00:05:57,846
Rym: five Hair comedy movies in 2000.

99
00:05:57,846 --> 00:06:00,613
Scott: I mean the funniest movie probably in that era.

100
00:06:00,633 --> 00:06:02,619
Scott: It might be hot fuzz, which is okay.

101
00:06:03,744 --> 00:06:06,900
Rym: Alright, let's see comedy movies from 2005.

102
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,925
Rym: I just found a website that seems to have a pretty good list Charlie and the Chocolate Factory The longest yard.

103
00:06:12,945 --> 00:06:14,230
Scott: I don't even know what that is.

104
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:14,792
Rym: I saw it.

105
00:06:15,013 --> 00:06:16,660
Rym: It was moderately funny.

106
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,154
Rym: Okay, 40 year old virgin in the worst movie.

107
00:06:20,174 --> 00:06:28,700
Rym: Uh Insulting to all nerds I Would say that it is not even a tenth as insulting to nerds as Big Bang Theory.

108
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,727
Scott: It's hanging out in the same swimming pool.

109
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:31,771
Scott: It's the same shit.

110
00:06:32,012 --> 00:06:33,939
Rym: The thing is that movie was moderately funny.

111
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:38,875
Rym: I would say that was moderately funny not saying it's a movie for all time.

112
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:39,718
Rym: It was not really funny.

113
00:06:39,758 --> 00:06:40,200

145
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:50,740
Scott: and it's okay.

146
00:07:51,001 --> 00:07:54,139

00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:56,852
Rym: Chicken little be cool.

148
00:07:56,872 --> 00:08:05,494

00:08:07,804 --> 00:08:10,156
Scott: Love actually supposed to be the fantastic movie.

151
00:08:10,217 --> 00:08:12,905

Rym: I said it was but I wouldn't call it a genre comedy movie.

158
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,582
Scott: Probably not You know, what?

159
00:08:27,642 --> 00:08:32,179
Rym: Is it partly that good comedy is within other broader works now?

160
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:39,039
Rym: I mean just a genre of a movie that is in genre comedy with a capital C that that has disappeared.

161
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:48,260
Scott: Yeah, I mean, yeah you there every movie City of God is listed here right anything any work has comedy in it, right?

162
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:58,520
Scott: You can get the most serious horror movie, right and Like super serious not trying to be campy horror movie like super serious horror movie and there's gonna be funny bits, right?

163
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,764
Scott: That's how it works.

164
00:08:59,844 --> 00:09:01,752
Scott: But we're talking about the pure.

165
00:09:01,772 --> 00:09:06,514
Scott: This is a Comedy made to be a comedy.

166
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:17,694
Scott: I think that genre unto a Blues Brothers or a Marx Brothers or some others was a Musical Smothers Brothers or some other kind of brothers.

167
00:09:17,835 --> 00:09:20,425
Scott: Yeah They're brothers involved.

168
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:22,452
Rym: Just two brothers two brothers.

169
00:09:22,472 --> 00:09:34,793
Scott: All right, you didn't get that joke, you know or like you know coming to America or I've not seen coming to America as an adult any kind of Kind of Richard Pryor action.

170
00:09:35,035 --> 00:09:40,220
Scott: Yeah That is this is a comedy that does anything it made anymore.

171
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:45,860
Scott: That's why I said the only kind of example is like the Edgar Wright kind of action and that's okay sometimes.

172
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,072
Rym: Actually, you know not on the same is real funny was what we do in the shadows.

173
00:09:51,153 --> 00:09:52,516
Rym: never really.

174
00:09:52,536 --> 00:09:53,720
Rym: it's a recent movie.

175
00:09:54,101 --> 00:09:55,569
Scott: What are you doing in the shadows?

176
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:56,654
Rym: It's a mockumentary.

177
00:09:56,674 --> 00:09:57,860
Scott: What are you doing in the shadows?

178
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,993
Rym: It's the same format as like best in show or that kind of thing.

179
00:10:01,113 --> 00:10:04,726
Rym: Oh, that's an okay, but it's about Vampires and they just kind of suck.

180
00:10:05,047 --> 00:10:09,267
Scott: That's the one where the the guys got like a messed up leg and he walks the dog At the end, right?

181
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,609
Rym: Oh Yeah, but I'm talking about the vampire movie.

182
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:14,712
Rym: that's in that same format.

183
00:10:14,873 --> 00:10:21,154
Rym: Okay, like say a similar style movie Finding Dory which I guess is the sequel to Finding Nemo.

184
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:22,360
Rym: That's apparently almost as good.

185
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,688
Scott: It has comedy but it's not a comedy.

186
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:25,672
Rym: I'm looking for a movie.

187
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:30,478
Rym: That was genre comedy, I guess Bad Moms Probably not good.

188
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,537
Rym: Whiskey Tango Foxtrot Swiss Army Man sing the Hollas hail Caesar.

189
00:10:37,557 --> 00:10:40,195
Rym: All right, hail Caesar I kind of wanted to see the Coen brothers movie.

190
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:41,462
Rym: That's it.

191
00:10:41,482 --> 00:10:42,485
Rym: That's a genre comedy.

192
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:44,691
Scott: I think I heard not good things.

193
00:10:44,691 --> 00:10:45,573
Rym: 83% fresh.

194
00:10:45,674 --> 00:10:47,699
Rym: That's better than the vast majority movies ever made.

195
00:10:50,176 --> 00:10:50,641
Rym: But yeah I would.

196
00:10:50,721 --> 00:10:57,668
Rym: I would suspect that movies that primarily say I am a comedy are fewer number than they used to be and I think That's an evolution of comedy.

197
00:10:57,688 --> 00:11:07,560
Scott: I think I think it's because The people who are currently the comedians right the top-level comedians are not really making movies, right?

198
00:11:07,861 --> 00:11:11,159
Rym: So think about what constitutes a top-level comedian though All right.

199
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,822
Scott: so if you

200
00:11:11,842 --> 00:11:21,000
Rym: know it's not like in the 90s people would say like they'd list stand-up comic artists or like SNL writers or like Simpsons writers, but now like who's gonna who you talk to you to be in a comedy

201
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:26,385
Scott: I'm saying like if you go back to the 90s, right like Fargo You have pre garbage.

202
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,373
Scott: Adam Sandler was at least making movies that were pretty garbage.

203
00:11:29,453 --> 00:11:31,900
Rym: Adam Sandler constitutes at most four movies.

204
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:32,785
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

205
00:11:32,806 --> 00:11:34,053
Scott: Oh, that's what I'm saying.

206
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:34,718
Scott: And then in the 80s, right?

207
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,800
Scott: You had all kinds of people right?

208
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,160
Scott: But now it's like you don't see Louis ck really making movies miss TV show or something, right?

209
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,919
Scott: You don't see key and peel aren't really making movies.

210
00:11:46,223 --> 00:11:53,220
Rym: So you should watch the Fargo TV show because one it's actually legit critically amazing like it's fantastic.

211
00:11:54,561 --> 00:11:56,126
Rym: But to key and peel are in it.

212
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,213
Rym: Sure and they're real good.

213
00:11:58,233 --> 00:11:58,976
Scott: It's not a movie.

214
00:11:58,996 --> 00:12:00,240
Scott: He's what I'm saying, right?

215
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:06,560
Scott: They're not making movies that are primarily comedies where they're the main characters and so forth right like used to happen.

216
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:12,780
Rym: Yeah, I guess if I'm thinking if I have to think about sausage party, I guess that's the current genre comedy.

217
00:12:12,921 --> 00:12:14,919
Scott: Well, that's the lowbrow that movie.

218
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:27,823
Rym: But I guess when I imagine genre comedy I guess the the end of that era that I keep that just I think of like the movie the kind of movie that comes to Mind is still better off dead Like that.

219
00:12:27,943 --> 00:12:30,953
Rym: and I just I don't think that format works any.

220
00:12:31,014 --> 00:12:32,760
Scott: you know, we have Monty Python really anymore.

221
00:12:33,181 --> 00:12:34,685
Rym: Yeah, Chris funny Python.

222
00:12:34,745 --> 00:12:37,213
Rym: They made two and a half funny movies.

223
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,456
Scott: that shit holds up forever though.

224
00:12:38,697 --> 00:12:39,720
Rym: Yeah, yeah actually kind of does.

225
00:12:41,823 --> 00:12:46,119
Rym: To be fair I have not seen Monty Python and the Holy Grail in the previous decade.

226
00:12:47,372 --> 00:12:48,986
Scott: You Laughed there you go.

227
00:12:49,588 --> 00:12:51,355
Scott: I just I just proved that it holds up.

228
00:12:51,696 --> 00:12:52,600
Scott: I'm wondering one word.

229
00:12:53,343 --> 00:12:53,785
Scott: I don't got it.

230
00:12:53,825 --> 00:12:57,000
Rym: You don't got to see it again, but in my brain, I didn't laugh right away my brain.

231
00:12:57,742 --> 00:13:01,230
Scott: You literally laughed out loud uncontrollably and not faking it.

232
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:08,972
Rym: All I had to do is say my brain thought pang And that is what I laughed at the new.

233
00:13:09,193 --> 00:13:12,697
Scott: ah, that doesn't matter I Got my shrubbery.

234
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,910
Scott: Therefore the movie holds up man.

235
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:18,559
Rym: How did Monty Python go from being?

236
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:29,227
Rym: Obscure nerd bullshit to every nerd quotes it all the time to mostly forgotten except by people like us again Because the generation after us didn't watch it.

237
00:13:29,287 --> 00:13:29,989
Rym: Yeah, pretty much.

238
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,078
Rym: So will the next generation be like we were?

239
00:13:33,098 --> 00:13:33,700
Scott: pass it down.

240
00:13:33,861 --> 00:13:42,340
Rym: Well our generation when we're older go to kids who are like, you know The young age that I first saw money Python like when my dad one day was like son.

241
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:43,019
Rym: I think you're ready.

242
00:13:43,543 --> 00:13:46,238
Rym: Here's a movie and I want you to just go in your room and watch it and tell me what you think.

243
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:49,691
Rym: and he gave Me Monty Python and the Holy Grail and I remember laughing so hard.

244
00:13:49,731 --> 00:13:51,477
Rym: I literally couldn't fucking breathe.

245
00:13:51,758 --> 00:13:53,214
Scott: Mm-hmm And I had to rewind.

246
00:13:53,234 --> 00:13:59,560
Rym: yeah Yeah, and I feel like because the VCR one or two generations of kids from now that same cycle will repeat.

247
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:04,800
Scott: I hope we can always go with meaning of life on the kids, right?

248
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,950
Scott: Yeah, because it's boobies in it and then they will agree to watch it.

249
00:14:08,251 --> 00:14:10,580
Rym: Yeah life of Brian's a little more cerebral.

250
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:15,403
Scott: That's only for the smart kids, yeah But it's better.

251
00:14:15,423 --> 00:14:19,156
Rym: So you got any news on gig nights Thursday the lounge.

252
00:14:19,176 --> 00:14:21,729
Scott: It's not it's not a big news but it's the only news I could find.

253
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:22,717
Scott: I had something to say about.

254
00:14:22,777 --> 00:14:27,480
Scott: so Basically t-mobile and sprint and now it's new unlimited plans.

255
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:36,220
Rym: Right, and I was actually thinking cuz the iPhone 7 is coming real soon I don't use more than like I have like 10 gigs a month between me and Emily and I don't I use like a game.

256
00:14:36,481 --> 00:14:39,692
Rym: You got the combo plan, yeah, it's way cheaper to get a combo plan.

257
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:40,315
Rym: Holy shit.

258
00:14:40,415 --> 00:14:44,680
Rym: Yeah, so yeah If you wanted to be a mobile we could do a three-way plan.

259
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,544
Scott: No, I have a variety.

260
00:14:45,564 --> 00:14:49,160
Scott: like a hundred gigs have Verizon iPhone 7s coming soon.

261
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,211
Scott: so based on what the iPhone 7 has.

262
00:14:51,231 --> 00:15:00,423
Scott: I'm either gonna get it or because my contracts over in October or I'll get the iPhone 7s in January February, which Hopefully would exist.

263
00:15:00,463 --> 00:15:07,019
Scott: Hopefully they'll keep that going right and update their success and I'll get a small iPhone 7. should be great if that happens.

264
00:15:08,181 --> 00:15:09,766
Scott: But anyway, so I'm thinking oh, you know what?

265
00:15:10,348 --> 00:15:17,250
Scott: Maybe it when I get the new phone, which is either now or then I'll get me switch over from Verizon to t-mobile.

266
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:22,635
Scott: save some money's right because I'm paying like a hundred something a month For you know more gigs than I need.

267
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:23,380
Rym: I mean we're Scott.

268
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:26,840
Rym: I'm paying a hundred bucks a month for tons of gigs for two people, right?

269
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,488
Scott: You know, I have as many gigs as I need.

270
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:32,568
Scott: I never really hit the limit and I only come close convention month.

271
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:37,811
Rym: if you go Skiing in northern New Hampshire, you won't get service.

272
00:15:38,193 --> 00:15:38,634
Scott: That's fine.

273
00:15:38,674 --> 00:15:40,360
Scott: I mean, I don't get service of horizon there either.

274
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,526
Rym: Yeah, actually Verizon had plenty of service there.

275
00:15:42,687 --> 00:15:50,260
Scott: Oh, maybe anyway, but you know, so I'm looking at this new plan They announced and it's like yeah, there's catches on this unlimited plan.

276
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:55,240
Scott: I'm like, what's there are I don't need the unlimited plan, but then I kept reading and it's like, you know And it goes worse.

277
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:04,319
Scott: so the catch they have with the unlimited plan is that all video playback is limited to 480 PS and To unlock to get real video playback.

278
00:16:04,801 --> 00:16:08,010
Scott: It's 25 bucks a month and Sprint doesn't even let you do it at all.

279
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,335
Scott: It's like they're just screwing you.

280
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:13,690
Scott: but t-mobile will let you pay 25 bucks extra to get real video playback if you want.

281
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:14,031
Rym: I wasn't that.

282
00:16:14,192 --> 00:16:22,660
Rym: only if you have the unlimited plan, I think otherwise, I think whatever resolution you want, but you're Right, and then don't watch a 4k video by accident.

283
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:29,347
Scott: I kept reading and it says oh, yeah, by the way with t-mobile You know if you tether it's only gonna be 2g.

284
00:16:30,713 --> 00:16:31,898
Rym: What Scott?

285
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:38,461
Rym: with t-mobile one I can tether my 4g But remember there's unlimited global roaming everywhere in the world.

286
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:41,249
Rym: I can tether overseas, but I only get 2g.

287
00:16:42,092 --> 00:16:45,024
Rym: That's the free global roaming nonsense.

288
00:16:45,445 --> 00:16:46,008
Rym: 2g tethering.

289
00:16:46,028 --> 00:16:52,834
Scott: in America I might as well have a dial-up modem and they'll charge you 15 a month to get LTE tethering.

290
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:58,428
Scott: but you pay 15 a month not unlimited LTE tethering but only for 5 gigs of LTE tethering.

291
00:16:58,448 --> 00:17:01,243
Scott: and if you do More even more tethering you got to pay another 15.

292
00:17:01,243 --> 00:17:02,430
Rym: This plan is the worst.

293
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:04,410
Rym: It literally just makes your cell service worse.

294
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:13,699
Scott: So I went to t-mobile and I realized you know If you look at the plans just straight up like the one that has the same number of gigs that I have not the unlimited One it looks like a great like.

295
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:15,829
Scott: I would just save like 30 40 bucks a month.

296
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:20,430
Scott: Right and I'm like, oh well, I guess I should still switch and just not get this garbage unlimited plan.

297
00:17:21,491 --> 00:17:32,610
Scott: But then I looked into it and to actually get all the stuff that I have on Verizon like unlimited LTE tethering and you know not messing with my video playback and all that it actually ends up costing the same.

298
00:17:33,232 --> 00:17:35,923
Rym: Well, I don't use much bandwidth for whatever reason.

299
00:17:35,943 --> 00:17:37,914
Rym: I don't know why you use so much bad I don't?

300
00:17:37,954 --> 00:17:39,190
Scott: I only use like six gigs.

301
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:45,984
Scott: I mean I have a 60 plan and I hardly use it except for months where there's like a Conventions or two conventions and then I sort of push the limit.

302
00:17:46,085 --> 00:17:46,647
Rym: That's what I'm saying.

303
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,696
Scott: most months I'm like under two gigs whatever.

304
00:17:48,716 --> 00:17:52,090
Rym: a hundred bucks a month for two phones tethering and everything is just fine.

305
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,414
Rym: None of those weird restrictions.

306
00:17:53,736 --> 00:17:57,067
Scott: I'm just saying I did the maths and it actually doesn't turn out to be better.

307
00:17:57,147 --> 00:17:59,191
Rym: So, yeah Hmm.

308
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:01,119
Scott: Yeah, that's it was interesting right?

309
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:03,929
Scott: It's like it looks better, but it's not better.

310
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,534
Rym: Yeah, well, you know what.

311
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:11,010
Rym: American cell phones are just kind of the worst and nothing we can do about that.

312
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:21,810
Scott: Yeah, I just want you know people before you get a phone plan or the next time you redo your phone plan look carefully At all the carriers and do the maths and see which you know.

313
00:18:22,091 --> 00:18:27,837
Scott: I think I might actually be able to switch a t-mobile and maybe save ten bucks or something in which case I might do that But it's not.

314
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:29,710
Scott: I thought I was gonna be saving 40 bucks a month.

315
00:18:29,951 --> 00:18:39,693
Rym: It's definitely worth it to switch if you travel at all because of the unlimited global roaming like the fact that in Canada Like you just say you go to your phone and that's the one thing you can do at T Mobile.

316
00:18:39,713 --> 00:18:48,180
Rym: that at least if you're an American you can't do it If you live anywhere else is when I went in for the first time and you know deep on your menus There's the roaming options and I was like, you know what?

317
00:18:48,843 --> 00:18:55,400
Rym: Let's just turn on data roaming everywhere Unlimited and it just totally works like you'll net.

318
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,223
Scott: don't charge you monies.

319
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,306
Rym: No, it's a hundred percent free.

320
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:58,510
Scott: How fast is it?

321
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:00,375
Rym: Uh, so by default.

322
00:19:00,936 --> 00:19:08,729
Rym: outside of North America you get 2g except most of Asia You'll end up getting 3g because that's the slowest the network can go.

323
00:19:09,892 --> 00:19:13,267
Rym: So you get 3g and like most of Asia you get 2g.

324
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:26,496
Rym: in most of Europe But a few places you get 3g just randomly and you get LTE in Canada and Mexico Mmm, so that alone makes it worth it because I looked into what it would cost to have data roaming Overseas if I was on any other provider.

325
00:19:26,596 --> 00:19:28,462
Scott: and you basically don't write for eyes.

326
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:33,562
Scott: if you call Verizon and say I'm going to Germany Can you please let me use Verizon in Germany?

327
00:19:33,603 --> 00:19:35,130
Rym: They're like how much money is in your wallet?

328
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:42,017
Scott: Yeah, they'll be like, oh give us a Zillion dollars you're like no actually what I'm gonna do is when I get to Germany is buy an SD card from some SIM card From someone else.

329
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:42,482
Scott: cuz fuck you.

330
00:19:42,523 --> 00:19:46,950
Rym: Yep Now you can't do that in Turkey, but Turkey's basically.

331
00:19:49,213 --> 00:19:51,684
Rym: But I did use my unlimited data a lot while I was there.

332
00:19:51,864 --> 00:19:55,118
Scott: also in places like that You can just get a temporary phone when you get there.

333
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:58,290
Rym: Yeah, uh, you got to show passports and weird shit.

334
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,175
Rym: It's kind of a pain.

335
00:19:59,195 --> 00:20:02,070
Scott: I mean it takes you 20 minutes at the airport when you land.

336
00:20:02,316 --> 00:20:09,290
Rym: Yeah But there's something magic about landing in some rando country and literally just turning airplane mode off and checking my email immediately.

337
00:20:09,816 --> 00:20:11,109
Rym: Like that feels real good.

338
00:20:11,716 --> 00:20:12,708
Rym: Okay, yeah.

339
00:20:13,871 --> 00:20:16,843
Rym: Also, honestly, I've done the SIM card thing.

340
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,149
Rym: It usually takes more than 20 minutes.

341
00:20:18,752 --> 00:20:24,870
Scott: the other thing is there's rumors, I mean, you know that The new iPhones will have more than one SIM slot.

342
00:20:25,322 --> 00:20:26,333
Rym: Yeah Cuz that's the thing.

343
00:20:26,414 --> 00:20:38,767
Rym: actually in a lot of other countries like especially in Asia to dual SIM card is The way you go this phones like with triple SIM cards, but it's not iPhones But you do it to arbitrage or if you travel between like China and another place regularly.

344
00:20:38,948 --> 00:20:39,068
Rym: Mm-hmm.

345
00:20:39,957 --> 00:20:44,350
Rym: so Uh interesting news kind of an aside because we were talking about this earlier.

346
00:20:45,191 --> 00:20:45,812
Rym: It's official.

347
00:20:46,053 --> 00:20:52,150
Rym: the data shows that this July was the hottest July as far as we can tell in human history.

348
00:20:53,612 --> 00:20:55,499
Rym: Definitely since 1880.

349
00:20:55,499 --> 00:20:56,925
Scott: Yeah, but I mean not since all of history.

350
00:20:56,945 --> 00:20:58,030
Scott: There was like a volcano era.

351
00:20:58,312 --> 00:20:59,439
Rym: Well, yeah, there was the Big Bang.

352
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:11,042
Scott: It was real hot during that sure But I mean I'm talking my earth right since you know earth is sure the dinosaurs had a hotter July Probably 40,000 or so years billions of years old though.

353
00:21:11,744 --> 00:21:13,610
Rym: Uh, yeah kind of irrelevant our current.

354
00:21:15,552 --> 00:21:17,866
Scott: I'm saying we survived this heat before billions of years ago.

355
00:21:17,886 --> 00:21:20,378
Rym: No problem Unless it just keeps going up.

356
00:21:21,042 --> 00:21:21,465
Scott: That's fine.

357
00:21:21,485 --> 00:21:22,330
Scott: I'd like it to keep going up.

358
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:31,680
Scott: We need to get to the point where there is a palm tree growing in the city, New York City followed quickly by malaria And the fact that downtown is gone.

359
00:21:31,881 --> 00:21:37,617
Scott: That's fine and I can bike in January February and every month of the day.

360
00:21:37,658 --> 00:21:43,860
Rym: in January you can buy because it's 100 degrees and then in June You literally can't go outside or you'll die like in a hydro bed.

361
00:21:44,021 --> 00:21:45,526
Scott: No, no, we need I can.

362
00:21:45,626 --> 00:21:48,938
Scott: I just need 100 degrees 24/7 way to make it perfect once a year.

363
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:51,390
Rym: So how's this June through September?

364
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,847
Rym: It's between 95 and 100 degrees outside sounds good during the day all the time.

365
00:21:56,088 --> 00:21:56,450
Scott: Sounds good.

366
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:01,326
Rym: September through November it gets to like 80. so you have like a nice like that's autumn.

367
00:22:01,347 --> 00:22:02,230
Rym: It's like 80 degrees out.

368
00:22:02,451 --> 00:22:05,484
Rym: Take it then from January to March.

369
00:22:06,127 --> 00:22:09,541
Rym: it is Negative one and covered in snow all the time.

370
00:22:10,143 --> 00:22:14,880
Rym: No, and then as soon as you hit April It's back to 70 degrees and then back to 100.

371
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,305
Scott: No, that's the January.

372
00:22:16,366 --> 00:22:17,590
Scott: March part needs some fixing.

373
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:19,685
Scott: How about like, you know, nice nice 70 degrees?

374
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:24,050
Rym: I'm gonna give you a nice skiing weather then you're gonna give me a nice or I'm gonna do nice biking weather.

375
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,237
Rym: You're gonna be some nice skiing weather.

376
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,509
Scott: Why don't we just contain all the snow?

377
00:22:28,132 --> 00:22:33,350
Scott: It's like somewhere no one wants to ever go and you can just go there and ski and not get snow on everyone.

378
00:22:33,471 --> 00:22:35,038
Rym: Yeah, if it could see I'd like it to be.

379
00:22:35,058 --> 00:22:36,123
Rym: I'd compromise.

380
00:22:36,143 --> 00:22:36,786
Scott: go to the Alps.

381
00:22:36,826 --> 00:22:37,570
Scott: I'm never going there.

382
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,534
Rym: I compromised on.

383
00:22:38,594 --> 00:22:47,275
Rym: it's 85 degrees year-round in New York City, but north of Poughkeepsie Across the entire country.

384
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:51,490
Rym: It is always under freezing and snows every day.

385
00:22:51,691 --> 00:22:52,353
Scott: How about this?

386
00:22:52,373 --> 00:23:00,068
Scott: we keep all the snow in some other country that you can go to and then once all the skiers are in One place on earth we make an avalanche and then skings done forever.

387
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:00,350
Scott: We're good.

388
00:23:01,212 --> 00:23:04,189
Rym: In fact, you just bought a new bike because it's bike buying season.

389
00:23:04,491 --> 00:23:06,710
Scott: It is but I didn't realize it was bike buying season.

390
00:23:06,831 --> 00:23:06,971
Rym: I was.

391
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:09,970
Rym: this time of year every year is the time when you buy all the seasonal shit, right?

392
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:10,373
Scott: It's like.

393
00:23:10,453 --> 00:23:12,470
Rym: well, so no, what's weird is Scott?

394
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,280
Rym: It's not just like though.

395
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,990
Rym: you buy the summer stuff at the end of the summer.

396
00:23:16,351 --> 00:23:20,550
Rym: No, you buy the skiing stuff at the end of the summer - wouldn't you buy the skiing stuff at the end of the winter?

397
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:23,370
Rym: No, actually, it's not cheaper then that's weird.

398
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:34,830
Rym: Yeah, it is weird because right now is when the 2017 models all come out 2017 skis - and yeah, all the 2017 skis are coming out so you can get the 2016 skis real cheap real.

399
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:36,277
Rym: So I'm looking at the skis.

400
00:23:36,318 --> 00:23:38,630
Rym: I'm looking at buying or about a thousand dollars retail.

401
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,682
Rym: What's wrong with the skis you got?

402
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:52,614
Rym: Actually, they're way old and I'm a way better skier than when I bought them and I know why they're shitty now Like I need better skis For real.

403
00:23:52,815 --> 00:23:53,841
Rym: so you want to know why.

404
00:23:53,922 --> 00:23:55,330
Scott: at least the thing with a bike, right?

405
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:58,290
Scott: It's like I keep my old bike, but with skis you can sell those skis.

406
00:23:58,551 --> 00:24:00,763
Rym: I'm gonna keep the old skis because there is a use for them.

407
00:24:00,984 --> 00:24:01,970
Scott: someone else goes in.

408
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,128
Rym: Nah, maybe but it'd have to be someone who's about as tall as me.

409
00:24:06,631 --> 00:24:09,269
Rym: But the use for those skis is that they're old and shitty, right?

410
00:24:09,811 --> 00:24:21,810
Rym: So if I do spring skiing a problem with skiing like in the early or late season Is that there's not a lot of snow like you're skiing But there's like a rock there or some grass there or like little shrubbery.

411
00:24:22,853 --> 00:24:23,435
Scott: Good idea.

412
00:24:23,737 --> 00:24:26,490
Scott: even it's like you're already not going skiing in the perfect ski weather.

413
00:24:26,671 --> 00:24:33,046
Scott: Definitely not going skiing when there's a rock sticking out of the snow Yeah, but it's like 50 degrees and you can wear like shorts.

414
00:24:33,086 --> 00:24:33,649
Rym: It's real fun.

415
00:24:34,211 --> 00:24:35,334
Rym: But you wear that.

416
00:24:35,415 --> 00:24:40,470
Rym: use the shitty skis when the snow covers thin so you bang up the bottoms of your shitty skis.

417
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:47,461
Rym: It's like having a shitty bike that you take to work because if someone steals it Same deal having the beater car in the real car.

418
00:24:47,481 --> 00:24:49,210
Rym: So you have the beater skis and the real skis.

419
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,118
Scott: Yeah, people own a Porsche and a Toyota.

420
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:53,107
Scott: You don't see them driving the Porsche frequently.

421
00:24:53,288 --> 00:24:54,592
Rym: Yep Great.

422
00:24:54,632 --> 00:25:00,765
Rym: I had that guy who worked with an IBM who had the Porsche that he raced and then he had the RX7 that he commuted in.

423
00:25:02,531 --> 00:25:05,082
Scott: Right, but he didn't take the Porsche to work that often.

424
00:25:05,182 --> 00:25:08,799
Rym: No, we brought the RX7 to work all the time Mostly because I was obsessed with it.

425
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:10,289
Rym: So we always wanted to take me out and show me stuff.

426
00:25:11,572 --> 00:25:13,589
Rym: That car was real cool, but I would never own one in my life.

427
00:25:15,112 --> 00:25:28,455
Rym: Yep, also interesting in the news today because it came and went so fast a Horrifying naked Donald Trump statue appeared in Union Square and apparently they appeared in cities all over America today And it was some sort of art project.

428
00:25:28,475 --> 00:25:32,028
Rym: All right as this funny little dick coming out multiple people asked me if I saw it.

429
00:25:33,054 --> 00:25:39,851
Rym: New York Park Service actually took it down real quick So I couldn't have gone to see it even if I wanted to and it's like you would have to take the subway to get There.

430
00:25:39,891 --> 00:25:41,596
Scott: it's not like they put it up outside rims office.

431
00:25:41,696 --> 00:25:45,850
Rym: Yep, but granted I could have taken the express train one stop from my office.

432
00:25:46,251 --> 00:25:47,695
Rym: Sure, no two stops.

433
00:25:47,715 --> 00:25:52,570
Rym: two stops because it also stops at does any Hall, but that's not like my news.

434
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:58,790
Rym: My news is that the New York City Parks Department is now my favorite department in New York other than the MTA.

435
00:25:59,031 --> 00:26:02,090
Rym: It's a good department because they had to take the statue down because that's their job.

436
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:16,362
Rym: Right, they issued a statement and their statement was we oppose quote any Unpermitted erection no matter how small That is the side I a plus shade.

437
00:26:16,422 --> 00:26:18,910
Rym: that is like pro level shade.

438
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:26,950
Rym: That is the kind of shade that you can get away with Officially making a statement as a government agency and yet no one can actually fault you for it.

439
00:26:27,231 --> 00:26:38,559
Scott: I do have to say like I've maybe talked to Parks Department employees like a few times and Every time I've ever talked to one it was usually to ask something about whatever city park I was in and they always know a lot.

440
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,510
Scott: They know way more than they should know.

441
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:44,370
Scott: They're like, you know museum curator level knowledge of whatever Park you're in.

442
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:54,134
Rym: Well, like when Emily's ago we went to Sandy Hook and saw the nuclear stuff but the time before when Emily and I went we this part guy was like standing outside of this old ruin and we're like What's the deal with the ruin?

443
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:57,886
Rym: and that guy was a museum encyclopedia of information about that ruin?

444
00:26:57,906 --> 00:27:02,138
Scott: Mm-hmm real cool, dude You didn't know anything about anything else.

445
00:27:02,641 --> 00:27:12,716
Rym: He might have we didn't ask about anything else but anyway things of the day You got anything got a thing of the day?

446
00:27:12,736 --> 00:27:17,110
Scott: Yeah, so I occasionally argue with some people about kitchen gadgets, right?

447
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,330
Scott: Cuz in the kitchen, there's like two philosophies.

448
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:29,665
Scott: The one philosophy is you can get these specialized gadgets that do like one thing really efficiently Sometimes or you can just use a knife for fucking everything because a knife does everything in the kitchen.

449
00:27:29,705 --> 00:27:38,768
Scott: on my phone pop my popcorn No, but here I. it's like you could buy for example an air popper to pop your popcorn Yeah, or you could pop it in a pan with like a lid on it.

450
00:27:38,848 --> 00:27:42,070
Scott: Yep And it's like is it okay to buy the air popper?

451
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:46,610
Rym: I would say yes because popping it in a pan fucking sucks is a pain in the ass, right?

452
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,115
Scott: So there are certain cases where the answer is.

453
00:27:48,155 --> 00:27:51,368
Scott: Yes, and there are certain cases where the answer is.

454
00:27:51,428 --> 00:27:51,990
Scott: No, right.

455
00:27:52,452 --> 00:27:54,684
Scott: So a good example of a yes would be.

456
00:27:54,805 --> 00:27:59,870
Scott: I have this thing That peels and cores and slices apples into a spiral.

457
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,114
Rym: Oh, yeah, I know that thing.

458
00:28:01,154 --> 00:28:06,930
Scott: it takes the peel off and now normally I would say no you should not get this thing.

459
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:11,377
Scott: However, if you ever plan on making an apple cake Yeah, you're gonna need to like.

460
00:28:11,417 --> 00:28:23,150
Scott: do this to like 20 fucking apples and then suddenly it becomes Okay, you can have that because doing that to 20 apples with a paring knife You know and once is gonna take you all fucking day hungry for apples, right?

461
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:29,615
Scott: But if you just have to do it to one apple because you're making like a baked apple or an apple pie which needs Significantly less apples than a cake.

462
00:28:30,137 --> 00:28:31,281
Scott: You should not own this thing.

463
00:28:31,322 --> 00:28:33,168
Scott: You're just being lazy and buying extra garbage.

464
00:28:33,188 --> 00:28:41,361
Scott: You don't need Yeah, so the number one offender is the garlic press because the garlic press is basically Like it doesn't?

465
00:28:41,442 --> 00:28:42,210
Scott: it's not any faster.

466
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:48,752
Scott: You could just smash a garlic clove with a knife like BAM and that takes a fraction of a second and then you just take Your knife.

467
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:51,610
Scott: and if you really need to go at it, you know, take it take it take it take it take it take it.

468
00:28:51,711 --> 00:28:52,818
Scott: Yeah, so there's a counterpoint.

469
00:28:52,858 --> 00:29:03,330
Rym: I'm pretty sure if I Google around and I'm not gonna cuz I don't want to see it pretty sure that there are instances of people who take the side Of the knife and try to smash it and end up just really kind.

470
00:29:04,072 --> 00:29:07,261
Scott: You're buying a device to make up for your lack of skills, right?

471
00:29:07,341 --> 00:29:08,384
Scott: It's basically what you're doing.

472
00:29:08,424 --> 00:29:09,607
Scott: It's not faster.

473
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,590
Scott: It's not more efficient.

474
00:29:10,651 --> 00:29:12,210
Scott: It's not something that you know.

475
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:28,636
Scott: If you're someone who you know cooks with garlic often and you should have a knife Obviously and you should learn to use the knife to smash peel Mince mush the garlic and if you don't know how to do this here is one of the best chefs to ever live John Pappin, holy

476
00:29:28,676 --> 00:29:30,081
Rym: shit is this guy fast at that

477
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:34,418
Scott: and he will show you he's a really old man now But you know, he's been chefing his whole life.

478
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:37,510
Scott: So he will show you the proper way to garlic.

479
00:29:37,571 --> 00:29:39,749
Scott: He's way better at it than me, but I'm good enough.

480
00:29:40,231 --> 00:29:46,030
Scott: So if you can watch him, I'm using the same technique he uses and I have been forever, but obviously I'm not at that level.

481
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:49,043
Scott: So it's basically I'm casting lit one.

482
00:29:49,104 --> 00:29:50,009
Scott: He's casting lit three.

483
00:29:51,133 --> 00:29:53,170
Scott: Right, so just copy what he's doing.

484
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:57,109
Scott: You'll be slower, but you won't need to buy a stupid garlic press like a baby.

485
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:03,849
Rym: now I will admit cuz you know I had this old shitty garlic press that we just had and it just was awful and I didn't really use it.

486
00:30:04,371 --> 00:30:11,610
Rym: But one day that I saw a different garlic press just in our thing and I used it and it was actually real good.

487
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:18,630
Scott: Obviously better things are better right if you try to do this to the garlic but like a blunt not sharp shitty knife Yeah, it's not gonna go.

488
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,376
Scott: Well, you need a sharp proper knife.

489
00:30:20,477 --> 00:30:24,030
Scott: actually the best thing for smashing garlics is a cleaver because it's nice and heavy.

490
00:30:24,251 --> 00:30:25,299
Scott: It's like BAM.

491
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:30,043
Rym: You can just smash the fuck out of them You know, however does not work very well is I've seen people attempt.

492
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,930
Rym: This is a meat tenderizer hammer.

493
00:30:32,191 --> 00:30:33,075
Scott: No, don't do that.

494
00:30:33,155 --> 00:30:34,581
Rym: Cuz you think oh, I'll just smash it.

495
00:30:34,682 --> 00:30:36,650
Scott: No, you will send garlic all over the place.

496
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,118
Rym: Yeah, the garlic will explode.

497
00:30:39,198 --> 00:30:39,760
Scott: don't do that.

498
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,770
Rym: But this garlic press was like, but it would be like it was fast.

499
00:30:42,911 --> 00:30:43,655
Rym: It worked great.

500
00:30:43,715 --> 00:30:44,882
Rym: I loved the shout out of this thing.

501
00:30:45,304 --> 00:30:46,270
Rym: I didn't even know where it came from.

502
00:30:46,651 --> 00:30:48,517
Rym: I assumed it was Emily's one day.

503
00:30:48,778 --> 00:30:52,190
Rym: Judith is over and she was like, how the fuck do you have my garlic press?

504
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:55,850
Rym: I've been looking for that shit for like a year and I still don't know how I got here.

505
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:56,352
Rym: I guess they cooked.

506
00:30:56,372 --> 00:31:03,237
Rym: they probably came over and cooked some and left it and brought and she took it back and Not don't have a garlic press and that's all.

507
00:31:03,257 --> 00:31:04,240
Scott: you don't need a garlic press.

508
00:31:04,682 --> 00:31:05,043
Rym: I don't know.

509
00:31:05,746 --> 00:31:07,030
Rym: in a race, right?

510
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:12,290
Scott: But you know, there's lots of kitchen gadgets out there and some of them are okay and some of them are not okay.

511
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:14,999
Rym: So I'm playing a lot of overwatch.

512
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:15,360
Rym: still.

513
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,805
Rym: the new patch is coming out looking pretty good.

514
00:31:16,865 --> 00:31:18,390
Rym: cuz two patches in a row.

515
00:31:18,851 --> 00:31:25,550
Rym: They're buffing a character that I think is already overpowered that I'm really good at and they're nerfing a character who gives me trouble.

516
00:31:25,971 --> 00:31:26,874
Rym: The game is twice.

517
00:31:26,894 --> 00:31:29,784
Scott: I mean they make their decisions based on the statistics.

518
00:31:29,824 --> 00:31:31,530
Scott: They see a win rates in such and such.

519
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,998
Rym: So the game is twice said.

520
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:35,170
Scott: your perception of what is Opie is incorrect.

521
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:35,832
Rym: Oh, no, I'm not.

522
00:31:35,993 --> 00:31:39,486
Rym: I very specifically feels Opie to me not actually Opie god.

523
00:31:39,546 --> 00:31:55,705
Rym: No, but Twice the game has looked at me and said Rym the thing you're doing the thing that you do every time you play we're gonna make that stronger and we're gonna make the thing that counters that weaker and I'm feeling real good about that for now until eventually I'm sure that pendulum will turn.

524
00:31:56,147 --> 00:32:01,830
Rym: but this is a short Animated video of someone explaining the plot of overwatch as far as I can tell.

525
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:06,150
Scott: Yeah, so I came into the room and I didn't really watch this video closely, but it's real funny.

526
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:16,230
Scott: I could tell it was about overwatch and I could tell that it was a YouTube video and I could tell it was like One of those internet shouty man's the annoying voice except it's not a man at all.

527
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,121
Rym: It's literally just like a guy voice acting this overwatch.

528
00:32:19,402 --> 00:32:21,409
Scott: and this is the kind of thing that's funny to 12 year olds.

529
00:32:21,932 --> 00:32:23,198
Rym: So I think it's legit funny.

530
00:32:23,379 --> 00:32:25,610
Rym: I think I think Scott is just an angry old killed.

531
00:32:25,771 --> 00:32:29,265
Scott: I think this is the kind of thing that's funny for 12 year olds and is garbage.

532
00:32:29,426 --> 00:32:32,660
Rym: and like alright listener I'm asking you which which thing today do you think was funnier?

533
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,448
Rym: the old man chopping garlic?

534
00:32:34,528 --> 00:32:36,872
Scott: It's not This.

535
00:32:37,013 --> 00:32:38,482
Scott: you I didn't bring a funny thing of the day.

536
00:32:38,503 --> 00:32:39,630
Scott: I brought a regular thing in.

537
00:32:40,432 --> 00:32:42,770
Rym: Alright old man chopping garlic is Scott's aesthetic.

538
00:32:43,071 --> 00:32:47,265
Rym: Meanwhile, mine is this really funny video explaining the plot of who do you respect more?

539
00:32:47,285 --> 00:32:47,867
Scott: the old man?

540
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,216
Scott: Who is one of the best chefs to ever live?

541
00:32:50,778 --> 00:32:54,030
Scott: or some garbage YouTube shithead making a crappy video?

542
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,939
Rym: I don't know why you say this guy's a YouTube shithead.

543
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:56,481
Rym: It's just a funny.

544
00:32:56,521 --> 00:32:58,250
Scott: first of all, his voice makes me want to murder him.

545
00:32:58,736 --> 00:32:59,506
Rym: I don't see why.

546
00:33:01,352 --> 00:33:02,237
Rym: I really don't see why.

547
00:33:02,338 --> 00:33:09,809
Scott: and second of all the aesthetic of the video Makes me want to murder anyone who likes this sort of thing.

548
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,709
Rym: Yeah, that's real funny.

549
00:33:13,931 --> 00:33:16,622
Scott: Yeah, Rym likes the ten-year-old kind of aesthetic.

550
00:33:16,943 --> 00:33:18,148
Rym: Scott's just salty cuz he doesn't play.

551
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:20,942
Scott: overwatch Which is the tribe has nothing to do with the subject matter.

552
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:21,525
Scott: This could have been.

553
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:22,410
Rym: I think it does.

554
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,539
Scott: This is about Mega Man.

555
00:33:23,579 --> 00:33:24,467
Scott: I would have said the same thing.

556
00:33:24,931 --> 00:33:34,070
Rym: Yeah, you couldn't be funny about Mega Man like you can't about overwatch though In the moment the book club book coming up is Rebecca.

557
00:33:36,593 --> 00:33:38,409
Rym: The previous book club book was Oryx and Crake.

558
00:33:38,771 --> 00:33:42,930
Rym: There is a new thing that Scott doesn't want to be a part of but a bunch of the rest of us are.

559
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:44,817
Rym: We're gonna do a GeekNights salon.

560
00:33:44,937 --> 00:33:46,081
Rym: It's a separate book club.

561
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:48,410
Scott: That's just can't do one book club.

562
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:49,777
Scott: You're gonna do two book clubs.

563
00:33:49,897 --> 00:33:51,626
Rym: Well, cuz you won't do nonfiction.

564
00:33:52,028 --> 00:33:59,270
Rym: So We're all gonna read either a long-form article or a nonfiction historical book of some kind.

565
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:06,771
Rym: Then we're gonna have a short podcast and a forum thread where we all having the common ground having read all the same Treatise.

566
00:34:07,133 --> 00:34:11,630
Scott: if you want to read nonfiction read devil in the white city, so we're gonna read like fiction.

567
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,897
Scott: But it actually is totally true.

568
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:15,109
Rym: So we're all reading this.

569
00:34:16,491 --> 00:34:18,860
Rym: Basically, it's a history of the Weimar Republic.

570
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,619
Scott: Oh my god leading through World War one Peter the great book yet in the bathroom.

571
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,406
Rym: I think the great book was actually really good.

572
00:34:26,507 --> 00:34:29,679
Rym: Oh my god I read almost that whole thing.

573
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:40,230
Rym: I'll just take a fucking nap But I did not know a lot about Actually the Weimar Republic's politics and you don't need to know what I've learned so far from this book.

574
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,058
Rym: That's real interest.

575
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:42,349
Scott: take a nap and pretend you read it.

576
00:34:42,591 --> 00:34:46,686
Rym: All the people are trying to compare Trump and the alt-right's rise to like 30s Germany.

577
00:34:46,726 --> 00:34:47,670
Rym: That is not true at all.

578
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:52,949
Scott: Read the Wikipedia page High level and wait and you read the book.

579
00:34:54,616 --> 00:34:59,872
Rym: No, but it's actually more like early 1920s.

580
00:34:59,912 --> 00:35:00,676
Scott: you're only gonna live.

581
00:35:00,696 --> 00:35:07,868
Scott: for how many more years of your life you're gonna waste that much time reading this old man Who's sharing videos of old men chopping up garlic.

582
00:35:07,888 --> 00:35:08,350
Scott: That's right.

583
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:14,610
Rym: Simultaneously a lot of good at people reading nonfiction and trying to make better than listen the rest of your life.

584
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:18,850
Scott: You're gonna eat a lot of food that's gonna be delicious with delicious garlic in it is an important life skill.

585
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,210
Rym: You want to read some book about Rebecca?

586
00:35:22,032 --> 00:35:23,747
Scott: Why my republic will not enrich you?

587
00:35:25,131 --> 00:35:25,493
Rym: Do you know what?

588
00:35:25,513 --> 00:35:26,918
Rym: do you know about the Weimar Republic?

589
00:35:26,998 --> 00:35:30,010
Scott: as much as I need to know what about Bismarckian politics?

590
00:35:30,331 --> 00:35:32,839
Scott: I know Bismarck was Bismarck.

591
00:35:32,859 --> 00:35:33,622
Rym: What did Bismarck do?

592
00:35:33,642 --> 00:35:34,806
Scott: The guy with the pointy head.

593
00:35:35,046 --> 00:35:36,110
Rym: That is yes.

594
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:49,526
Rym: That is so that aesthetic is as much as I need to know What about Brandenburg and Prussia and I know the Brandenburg has a gate And if you build it your units get I think 15 X.

595
00:35:50,236 --> 00:35:50,769
Scott: That's right.

596
00:35:53,071 --> 00:35:54,197
Scott: It's all you need to know.

597
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:55,464
Rym: we're gonna be at PAX West.

598
00:35:55,484 --> 00:35:56,670
Scott: This is the year 2016.

599
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,655
Scott: That's just long gone.

600
00:35:57,976 --> 00:36:01,030
Rym: Saturday September 3rd 5 p.m Chicken theater the grind.

601
00:36:01,412 --> 00:36:04,410
Rym: I started making graphics and stuff for our slides for the panel.

602
00:36:04,812 --> 00:36:08,310
Rym: I think the panels gonna be real good and be editing those slides and add this up to it over the course of the week.

603
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:10,300
Scott: I'm gonna at work.

604
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,696
Scott: I had to do work today, but starting tomorrow I'm gonna be putting in the JPEGs.

605
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:18,576
Rym: if any of you remember our older lecture on Competitive tests of skill in games.

606
00:36:18,857 --> 00:36:19,961
Rym: We had all these charts.

607
00:36:20,543 --> 00:36:22,410
Rym: I'm working on similar charts for this panel.

608
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,654
Scott: I'm gonna delete rims charts.

609
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:24,758
Scott: the charts were good.

610
00:36:24,778 --> 00:36:26,062
Scott: stick with my funny JPEGs.

611
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:28,389
Rym: Yeah, you're I think you forget my charts.

612
00:36:29,272 --> 00:36:36,132
Rym: They culminated in that moment where he showed the Counter-Strike chart and you can see that head clicking is the 80% Skill of that game.

613
00:36:36,312 --> 00:36:36,733
Scott: It's true.

614
00:36:37,454 --> 00:36:39,597
Rym: But PAX is gonna be super fucking awesome this year.

615
00:36:39,617 --> 00:36:43,984
Rym: We're gonna be there doing a panel also, uh Atari game design.

616
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:54,820
Rym: I finally uploaded the most complex video of a GeekNights panel I've ever uploaded and it's a real good panel and it's in glorious 4k and I have no complaints about it.

617
00:36:55,101 --> 00:36:58,415
Rym: And you should all watch it because I think it's one of our better recent lectures.

618
00:36:58,596 --> 00:37:00,302
Scott: I don't think it's that great I think it's pretty good.

619
00:37:00,724 --> 00:37:01,305
Rym: What's a better one?

620
00:37:01,807 --> 00:37:02,810
Scott: All the other ones like what?

621
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,817
Rym: Which one all which one every single one?

622
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:11,023
Rym: Okay so umbrellas This rims idea.

623
00:37:11,725 --> 00:37:13,932
Rym: I had many more ideas that you were not into.

624
00:37:14,072 --> 00:37:18,406
Scott: all I did was confirm that we had not done this idea By searching our database.

625
00:37:18,426 --> 00:37:20,253
Rym: I even proposed that it's actually possible.

626
00:37:20,293 --> 00:37:21,137
Scott: We have done this idea.

627
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:23,250
Rym: in my search failed I just I also.

628
00:37:23,311 --> 00:37:27,102
Rym: I searched for umbrella umbrellas Raining.

629
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:28,788
Scott: I said I searched for weather.

630
00:37:29,089 --> 00:37:29,370
Rym: Yep.

631
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:30,675
Rym: I think we've talked about whether.

632
00:37:30,695 --> 00:37:31,097
Rym: a bunch of time.

633
00:37:31,117 --> 00:37:31,980
Scott: Yeah warm today.

634
00:37:32,081 --> 00:37:33,539
Scott: We talked about whether every fucking episode.

635
00:37:34,941 --> 00:37:40,760
Rym: But I also proposed that we just continue that kind of unexpected thing at the beginning where we talked about comedy.

636
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:41,814
Rym: Just keep talking about comedy.

637
00:37:41,834 --> 00:37:44,886
Scott: Yeah Scott I'm out of stuff to say.

638
00:37:45,067 --> 00:37:48,360
Rym: rather than comedy Scott is much more invested in that old man in his garlic.

639
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:50,458
Scott: The garlic is most delicious.

640
00:37:52,101 --> 00:37:54,395
Scott: Garlic is more delicious than the comedy is funny.

641
00:37:54,657 --> 00:38:00,238
Rym: You're lucky It was not an old man chopping onions because I think that would have been even more comedically apt.

642
00:38:00,459 --> 00:38:05,395
Scott: onion Cutting is actually even more important because you can avoid crying if you'd have proper technique.

643
00:38:06,198 --> 00:38:06,760
Rym: Oh, yeah the whole thing.

644
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:12,280
Scott: Here's the problem the the when I watch use a fresh onion if he's an old onion.

645
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,877
Rym: That's why I could be crying when I watch chef's videos of how they cut and prepare onions.

646
00:38:16,138 --> 00:38:21,258
Rym: primarily The thing I learned about restaurants is that they throw away like half the fucking onion.

647
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:26,664
Scott: also Throw away a ton of fucking food also core the shit out of onions Like also.

648
00:38:26,684 --> 00:38:27,930
Rym: I don't need to core it that much.

649
00:38:28,191 --> 00:38:30,835
Scott: also they do it so fast They don't have time to cry.

650
00:38:30,855 --> 00:38:31,140
Scott: It's like.

651
00:38:32,282 --> 00:38:35,678
Rym: But no they throw away like half the onion when they restaurants waste tons of fucking food.

652
00:38:35,738 --> 00:38:36,080
Scott: not news.

653
00:38:36,322 --> 00:38:42,440
Scott: Yeah, because you know You can't make like the same thing look beautiful if like you're using like the middle of the onion where the Rings are time.

654
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:47,346
Scott: You know when I worked at the Bella's like you go to you go to the section where there's like the onion rings and they're All full size.

655
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:50,060
Scott: Yeah, cuz they threw away all the middle of the onion where the Rings are smaller.

656
00:38:50,222 --> 00:38:51,515
Rym: You gotta chop that up put it in the soup.

657
00:38:52,301 --> 00:38:53,425
Scott: Sure, maybe they did.

658
00:38:53,485 --> 00:38:54,027
Scott: maybe they didn't.

659
00:38:54,328 --> 00:39:02,860
Rym: I was there one of my jobs way back when I worked at the Bella's back RIT that job that I famously quit by just one day deciding not to go in anymore.

660
00:39:03,101 --> 00:39:03,925
Scott: I should do that tomorrow.

661
00:39:04,387 --> 00:39:11,240
Rym: Oh, yeah, I can live a little while on my savings But I was in charge of actually prepping all the onions and tomatoes in the morning.

662
00:39:11,662 --> 00:39:12,686
Rym: I get there like 6 a.m.

663
00:39:13,088 --> 00:39:15,660
Rym: And I peel a bunch of onions and I wouldn't call him at all.

664
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,289
Rym: I just throw them all in a giant onion grinder.

665
00:39:18,429 --> 00:39:22,407
Scott: Yeah, just grind them out because you know onion bits basically No rings.

666
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:26,397
Rym: just needed onion shavings effectively and it worked real well.

667
00:39:26,418 --> 00:39:28,768
Rym: and My eyes would.

668
00:39:29,271 --> 00:39:32,586
Rym: they would turn like deep Satan-esque red.

669
00:39:32,646 --> 00:39:33,811
Scott: Why did you wear the goggles?

670
00:39:34,092 --> 00:39:34,635
Scott: They do nothing.

671
00:39:34,755 --> 00:39:35,840
Rym: the goggles did fucking nothing.

672
00:39:35,981 --> 00:39:39,780
Rym: Okay, I guess if I'd worn swim goggles and nose clips, I might have been okay.

673
00:39:40,101 --> 00:39:42,849
Rym: But now I had safety goggles on with a little vents on the side.

674
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,979
Rym: No, that was just an onion greenhouse for the eyes.

675
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:53,800
Rym: Nope Yeah, in fact the day I quit but I was trying like why did you try like the the Horace Grant sports goggles?

676
00:39:55,183 --> 00:39:56,187
Rym: Uh, I don't think I owned any.

677
00:39:56,548 --> 00:39:57,713
Scott: you could get some with your.

678
00:39:57,934 --> 00:40:01,872
Rym: uh, if I had money back then I would not have been working at the Bellas in the first place, right?

679
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,444
Scott: I Repo man.

680
00:40:04,725 --> 00:40:08,380
Rym: that whole era of my life can be summed up by all the jobs I had during that era.

681
00:40:08,844 --> 00:40:14,610
Rym: I regret having and I should adjust done without money Because those jobs were horrible.

682
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,120
Rym: working for minimum wage is the worst thing.

683
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,371
Scott: So umbrellas umbrellas.

684
00:40:20,162 --> 00:40:23,180
Rym: It's two philosophies with umbrellas much like same as sunglasses.

685
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:34,760
Rym: yep, either buy the best like the perfect umbrella and take very good care of it and use forever or by a Neverending parade of shit Brella's see with sunglasses.

686
00:40:34,941 --> 00:40:41,255
Scott: I originally was doing $20 sunglasses from the rest stop and Losing them breaking them and getting new ones not caring.

687
00:40:41,295 --> 00:40:47,178
Scott: but then I realized hey I've already spent like hundreds of dollars in stupid sunglasses and I bought multi hundred dollar sunglasses.

688
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,526
Scott: and Because they're multi hundred dollars there.

689
00:40:49,807 --> 00:40:56,399
Scott: I guess more durablos and not breaking and since there's so much money I'm not forgetting them anywhere and I haven't lost them.

690
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,697
Scott: Yeah, so they've lasted me longer than clearly longer than ten pairs of $20 sunglasses.

691
00:41:01,717 --> 00:41:09,328
Scott: So umbrellas though You know, I was doing the $5 umbrellas and then one day our umbrellas last 1.5 rainstorms.

692
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:10,553
Scott: Yeah, they break way fast.

693
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,480
Scott: So I bought a more expensive umbrella.

694
00:41:12,641 --> 00:41:15,638
Scott: It was really big though, and then if I can lost it.

695
00:41:16,263 --> 00:41:17,900
Rym: So then I was like how big are we talking Scott?

696
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,010
Rym: Are we talking golf umbrella?

697
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,080
Rym: Cuz I hate you if that's true.

698
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:20,823
Scott: No, well, it was just.

699
00:41:20,883 --> 00:41:25,100
Scott: it was normal size in terms of its diameter, but it was a full stick.

700
00:41:25,622 --> 00:41:29,600
Rym: Ah, oh, so that's the biggest debate is do you get a stick or a collapsible?

701
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,884
Scott: It was it was super durable Like it was totes.

702
00:41:32,145 --> 00:41:37,008
Scott: is that had like a super crazy rubberized handle and like oh, I've seen those It was never gonna break.

703
00:41:37,229 --> 00:41:39,160
Rym: They got nothing on those sends sticks.

704
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:40,205
Scott: No, but it was.

705
00:41:40,225 --> 00:41:43,180
Scott: it was a full-size stick but a normal, you know radius umbrella.

706
00:41:43,361 --> 00:41:46,351
Scott: Anyway, that umbrella was great, but I lost it.

707
00:41:46,411 --> 00:41:48,198
Scott: I left it somewhere cuz it's like I wasn't.

708
00:41:48,238 --> 00:41:52,090
Scott: you know, it's So big you're more likely like put it down.

709
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:52,511
Rym: Yep.

710
00:41:52,572 --> 00:41:55,320
Rym: Stick umbrellas are obsolete in the modern era.

711
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,800
Rym: They're just worse in every way and you're gonna lose them, right?

712
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,549
Scott: So anyway So now I can't went back to the cheap ones.

713
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:04,128
Scott: and then I want an Amazon and bought the highest rated umbrella like some Gusbuster thing.

714
00:42:04,148 --> 00:42:05,159
Scott: they had like a crazy warranty.

715
00:42:05,501 --> 00:42:09,719
Scott: Busters have always been shit and it showed like videos in a wind tunnel and stuffs and it was 40 bucks.

716
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:10,968
Scott: I'm like, alright fine.

717
00:42:10,988 --> 00:42:12,579
Scott: That's eight umbrellas.

718
00:42:13,044 --> 00:42:15,730
Rym: so I bought it and True to its word.

719
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:29,700
Scott: It was more Durable than the cheapo umbrella, right and but the problem was the umbrella mechanism did not break Like all the other parts broke like the little strap came off and the velcro strap.

720
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:34,560
Scott: It's like all these other parts of the umbrella broke but not the actual umbrella mechanism itself.

721
00:42:35,182 --> 00:42:40,582
Scott: Until eventually it broke and there is a lifetime warranty, but it was such a pain in the ass I was just like fuck it.

722
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:41,927
Scott: I went back to the cheap umbrellas.

723
00:42:42,188 --> 00:42:45,720
Scott: Yeah, and now I've been subsisting on free umbrellas.

724
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,426
Scott: They get at work.

725
00:42:46,486 --> 00:42:48,019
Scott: They gave out umbrellas with the company logo.

726
00:42:48,341 --> 00:42:51,029
Scott: Whoa, I've been using that and it broke because it's cheap.

727
00:42:51,551 --> 00:42:54,480
Scott: but only one of the metal sticks broke so you can still use it.

728
00:42:55,384 --> 00:42:56,480
Scott: So but I'm in the market.

729
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,773
Scott: I kick-started this umbrella called the saw umbrella and they had.

730
00:43:00,853 --> 00:43:01,796
Rym: I feel like kick-starting.

731
00:43:01,816 --> 00:43:04,488
Rym: an umbrella is Real like that.

732
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:06,560
Rym: shit's not gonna come out or be worthwhile.

733
00:43:07,645 --> 00:43:10,660
Scott: They haven't delivered it yet, but they keep posting updates.

734
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,723
Scott: So they are working on it.

735
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:19,047
Scott: and this umbrella is fancy in that it's sort of like an ultra modern kind of umbrella Where it doesn't have like all these mechanisms.

736
00:43:19,127 --> 00:43:23,060
Scott: It works more like a Japanese umbrella, but it it's like a solid color.

737
00:43:23,262 --> 00:43:24,270
Scott: You know, it's it's interesting.

738
00:43:24,331 --> 00:43:30,620
Rym: So yeah The only advancement that was needed an umbrella technology is the sense ones that are asymmetric.

739
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:33,171
Scott: I feel like that you and that you and the weird a cement.

740
00:43:33,191 --> 00:43:35,140
Scott: It's like, you know, that's like toe shoes of umbrellas.

741
00:43:35,963 --> 00:43:37,569
Scott: But you wear toe shoes and you tell a kilt.

742
00:43:37,589 --> 00:43:39,175
Scott: so why not get the weird umbrella just set?

743
00:43:39,196 --> 00:43:41,238
Scott: hear me out Let's get the full set.

744
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:41,823
Rym: So hear me out.

745
00:43:41,843 --> 00:43:45,200
Rym: if you live in like bullshit suburbia where you're never walking on this might as well.

746
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,840
Scott: Yeah, you got to take all three of those things in your recumbent bicycle.

747
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:57,047
Rym: So actually I saw someone legit a couple years ago biking and they had one of these sends umbrellas Like mounted on the front of their bike.

748
00:43:57,589 --> 00:44:00,100
Scott: Uh-huh, and they were going like wearing toe shoes.

749
00:44:00,562 --> 00:44:03,414
Scott: No, but they were going like and you tell a kill because that's you.

750
00:44:03,494 --> 00:44:08,556
Rym: they were going easily 15 me I'll make pushing 20 miles an hour on their bike and those umbrellas working fine.

751
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:09,560
Rym: It looked real stupid.

752
00:44:12,061 --> 00:44:15,679
Scott: Listen I do agree with function over form, but there's a limit.

753
00:44:18,162 --> 00:44:22,179
Scott: At some point you can no longer sacrifice form you must maintain form.

754
00:44:22,942 --> 00:44:24,308
Scott: No, you're getting more functionality.

755
00:44:24,509 --> 00:44:25,373
Rym: But so hear me out on this.

756
00:44:25,393 --> 00:44:29,472
Rym: if you live on umbrellas There are two cases for umbrellas.

757
00:44:29,794 --> 00:44:32,028
Rym: in terms of normal use cases It's raining.

758
00:44:32,048 --> 00:44:33,560
Scott: I don't want to get wet use case one.

759
00:44:33,681 --> 00:44:35,410
Rym: You live outside of a real city.

760
00:44:35,511 --> 00:44:35,993
Rym: use case to.

761
00:44:36,013 --> 00:44:41,119
Rym: you live in a real city Because if you're outside of a city just get a gigantic fucking golf umbrella.

762
00:44:41,441 --> 00:44:44,431
Scott: Yeah, you're only using the umbrella to get to your car.

763
00:44:44,451 --> 00:44:46,137
Rym: Yep to and from car.

764
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:46,880
Rym: That's it.

765
00:44:47,202 --> 00:44:54,940
Rym: So just get a giant umbrella so your legs don't get way you don't have to carry it so you can get a huge ass stick and toss it in the backseat and You're never in anyone's way.

766
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,868
Rym: So it's fine and your umbrella is gonna be.

767
00:44:56,948 --> 00:44:59,639
Scott: you can get one that's super durable and you're not gonna lose it.

768
00:45:00,082 --> 00:45:01,737
Scott: So, you know who gives a shit, right?

769
00:45:01,818 --> 00:45:02,019
Scott: Yep

770
00:45:02,301 --> 00:45:02,803
Rym: But if you're

771
00:45:02,843 --> 00:45:12,500
Scott: gonna say actually you need more than one because you need one to leave in the car And you need one to be in the house Yep And then you just have to remember that if you ever use the one from in the house to get to the car

772
00:45:12,701 --> 00:45:16,739
Rym: Oh god, send cells an umbrella mount for their bikes.

773
00:45:19,045 --> 00:45:26,269
Scott: Wow If you ever use the house umbrella to get to the car make sure when you get back to the house you bring one of The two umbrellas back into the house.

774
00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:27,800
Rym: I don't think this is what I saw.

775
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,178
Rym: I think this dude a jury-rigged it but they make this thing rims ordering it.

776
00:45:33,258 --> 00:45:33,840
Scott: I see him click it.

777
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,558
Scott: I'm by nice typing his credit card number.

778
00:45:36,142 --> 00:45:37,468
Rym: You know what this mount is?

779
00:45:37,849 --> 00:45:39,195
Rym: It's literally just a tube.

780
00:45:39,697 --> 00:45:44,640
Rym: Uh-huh It's a tube that you just take the bottom of the umbrella and that's he's buying it.

781
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,772
Rym: I see this is not getting bought by Rym.

782
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:47,859
Scott: He could buy now just now.

783
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:53,160
Rym: So in a city if you use a large umbrella.

784
00:45:53,641 --> 00:45:56,731
Rym: But you are the worst form of vile humanity.

785
00:45:56,771 --> 00:45:59,520
Scott: Now, maybe you're in some city like Hartford, Connecticut.

786
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,230
Rym: You're not a city.

787
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:00,494
Rym: I don't know.

788
00:46:01,181 --> 00:46:04,533
Scott: There's no people on the sidewalk and you can use the large umbrella without touch.

789
00:46:04,573 --> 00:46:08,570
Rym: if you're in New York and your umbrella is wider Than a standard small bodega umbrella.

790
00:46:08,771 --> 00:46:10,780
Rym: Like I hope you fall into a manhole and die.

791
00:46:11,161 --> 00:46:16,980
Scott: Yeah, I mean I have like if my if my umbrella accidentally popes poke someone with a large umbrella in the eyeball fuck them.

792
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:23,875
Rym: Now I worked with the guy who made an argument that because he was he was shall we say a large gentleman a Wide knit wide a gentleman.

793
00:46:23,895 --> 00:46:27,429
Rym: Uh-huh And his argument was a small umbrella does not cover him.

794
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:29,596
Rym: and my response was I don't care.

795
00:46:29,997 --> 00:46:32,577
Scott: My response was That's correct.

796
00:46:35,724 --> 00:46:36,551
Scott: You have Justin saw.

797
00:46:36,571 --> 00:46:37,379
Scott: you said it not me.

798
00:46:37,821 --> 00:46:41,454
Scott: I believe the comedic sponsor would be a small umbrella doesn't cover my large body.

799
00:46:41,514 --> 00:46:42,357
Rym: go on.

800
00:46:42,678 --> 00:46:47,649
Scott: Yes Your body is quite large large person.

801
00:46:47,669 --> 00:46:55,100
Rym: but The problem with the standard bodega size umbrella is that shit you get what you pay for five bucks.

802
00:46:55,181 --> 00:46:56,320
Scott: Yeah, it just falls apart.

803
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:00,200
Rym: But also because the small umbrella that is acceptable to use in a place like New York.

804
00:47:00,541 --> 00:47:04,655
Rym: The problem with it is if it's raining hard your legs are probably gonna get wet.

805
00:47:04,675 --> 00:47:06,120
Rym: That's true pretty wet.

806
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,546
Scott: No, that's not a big deal though.

807
00:47:07,928 --> 00:47:10,620
Scott: But I mostly just keep my bag close to none of my electronic bits.

808
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:11,404
Rym: Oh, I also.

809
00:47:11,765 --> 00:47:12,831
Scott: I don't care if I get wet.

810
00:47:12,891 --> 00:47:16,680
Scott: I just like my kick in my iPad way But it's really my phone's waterproof.

811
00:47:16,743 --> 00:47:17,080
Rym: I don't care.

812
00:47:17,281 --> 00:47:26,780
Rym: But if you're walking in New York if you walk slower Scott Like if we walk like normal terrible people do and you don't have a long stride your legs get less way.

813
00:47:27,202 --> 00:47:28,770
Rym: That's true, but it's real painful to walk.

814
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:29,936
Rym: that shallow like it just hurts.

815
00:47:30,036 --> 00:47:30,740
Rym: I feel bad.

816
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:36,480
Rym: Yeah, so the asymmetric umbrella is real long like it's as big as a golf umbrella front to back.

817
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:39,794
Rym: But it's normal umbrella size on the sides.

818
00:47:40,175 --> 00:47:43,607
Rym: So I don't get in anyone's way It's acceptable to use in New York City.

819
00:47:43,948 --> 00:47:47,760
Rym: and yet my legs don't get wet because I basically have a golf umbrella in one direction.

820
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,527
Scott: I didn't say that it wasn't functional.

821
00:47:49,607 --> 00:47:53,743
Scott: I said you sacrificed the form for that function just like So.

822
00:47:53,843 --> 00:47:58,420
Rym: in the old days the first sense umbrella was a stick only and I bought it.

823
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,565
Rym: It was like 70 bucks.

824
00:47:59,846 --> 00:48:03,420
Rym: And of course, I lost it within a year because it was a stupid stick.

825
00:48:04,261 --> 00:48:08,638
Rym: So I bought another one and I said Rym if you lose this one, you don't deserve good umbrellas.

826
00:48:08,698 --> 00:48:09,819
Rym: and sure enough I lost that one.

827
00:48:10,981 --> 00:48:12,485
Scott: You're back to the $5.00.

828
00:48:12,485 --> 00:48:13,810
Rym: No, so then a few years ago.

829
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:17,120
Rym: I saw that they made a folding asymmetric umbrella.

830
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:18,003
Scott: You still have it.

831
00:48:18,605 --> 00:48:19,870
Scott: Uh, so I bought it.

832
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:21,355
Scott: You think you lost it or it broke?

833
00:48:21,716 --> 00:48:27,040
Rym: Uh, it broke Oh, but I caught the company and I was like, oh you got a lifetime war.

834
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,352
Rym: Oh, you actually did the warranty.

835
00:48:28,412 --> 00:48:29,240
Scott: I could have done that on the guy.

836
00:48:29,481 --> 00:48:37,199
Rym: Not only that but they responded they had improved it because they knew it had flaws and the one the one they gave me in return Is basically perfect.

837
00:48:37,615 --> 00:48:48,929
Scott: well see I would buy a fancier umbrella right now because my like I said my company branded cheapo umbrella has one broken metal stick and it's rain soon, but That Kickstarter umbrella will arrive at some point.

838
00:48:49,391 --> 00:48:51,680
Rym: So I don't want to buy about your hex light on it.

839
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:57,518
Scott: I don't want to buy a fancy umbrella and then immediately get this Kickstarter umbrella and have two fancy umbrellas.

840
00:48:57,578 --> 00:48:58,240
Scott: That would be stupid.

841
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:58,883
Rym: Yeah, that's true.

842
00:48:58,903 --> 00:49:00,210
Rym: It's also you gotta wait to see if it's good.

843
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:01,014
Rym: Like it might be great.

844
00:49:01,034 --> 00:49:02,180
Rym: It's like wait for a new iPhone.

845
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:07,236
Scott: I'll stick with the cheap ones until the kick-started one shows up and then that will be the the point of.

846
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,687
Scott: well as The game of life puts it the day of reckoning.

847
00:49:10,707 --> 00:49:11,670
Rym: Oh here.

848
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:14,820
Rym: I found a thing that shows the progression of those umbrellas.

849
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,946
Rym: That's the stick one that I kept losing.

850
00:49:16,966 --> 00:49:18,029
Rym: Mm-hmm.

851
00:49:18,049 --> 00:49:22,441
Rym: And that's the one that broke on me the folding one and that's the modern one Mm-hmm.

852
00:49:23,183 --> 00:49:24,587
Rym: So I really like that umbrella.

853
00:49:24,607 --> 00:49:27,977
Rym: Uh, I think because it's a folding umbrella.

854
00:49:27,997 --> 00:49:28,980
Rym: So it's really tiny.

855
00:49:29,662 --> 00:49:35,609
Rym: I'll never lose it because I just literally put it in my bag and it's fine Mm-hmm, and I brought it on not a stick.

856
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:36,172
Rym: We'll lose it.

857
00:49:36,593 --> 00:49:39,957
Rym: Mm-hmm We've tapped the well of umbrellas.

858
00:49:41,903 --> 00:49:43,040
Scott: They keep you from getting wet.

859
00:49:43,143 --> 00:49:47,917
Scott: Well, oh, no We forgot about the part Rym believes that people in Michigan don't use umbrellas in the south in Bose.

860
00:49:47,937 --> 00:49:49,565
Rym: the kids in southeast Michigan like.

861
00:49:49,725 --> 00:49:49,926
Rym: I don't.

862
00:49:49,946 --> 00:49:51,091
Scott: but I don't believe this story.

863
00:49:51,132 --> 00:49:56,070
Rym: I think it's just I'm just saying in high school in particular No one ever took an umbrella to school.

864
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:59,100
Rym: Like I don't think I ever saw an umbrella in my high school ever.

865
00:49:59,603 --> 00:50:00,369
Scott: I don't believe this.

866
00:50:00,389 --> 00:50:01,980
Rym: you would drive to school and it was raining.

867
00:50:02,322 --> 00:50:07,113
Rym: People just like trying to park real close to the building and just run in Because it's not like you went back outside during the day.

868
00:50:07,173 --> 00:50:08,179
Scott: It sounds a bit far-fetched.

869
00:50:09,046 --> 00:50:12,626
Rym: No one ever used umbrellas in high school Especially to my high school.

870
00:50:13,027 --> 00:50:16,039
Rym: my middle school kids were not allowed to bring umbrellas.

871
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:23,795
Rym: Remember that I think because people were hitting each other with them and it was one of those things You know a school will like will be like listen you shits no more gum ever.

872
00:50:23,856 --> 00:50:24,780
Rym: someone ruined it for you.

873
00:50:25,263 --> 00:50:27,840
Rym: I think someone ruined umbrellas for us in middle school.

874
00:50:28,661 --> 00:50:29,385
Rym: That's a separate thing.

875
00:50:29,405 --> 00:50:31,234
Rym: That was that school, but I'm telling you in high school.

876
00:50:31,254 --> 00:50:32,340
Rym: I was a Michigan.

877
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:36,340
Rym: No one ever ever ever took a stupid umbrella to high school.

878
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,443
Rym: Like just you.

879
00:50:37,483 --> 00:50:43,020
Rym: just walk through the rain because you were only ever outside if it was raining between your car and the high school.

880
00:50:43,181 --> 00:50:44,178
Scott: It sounds a bit ridiculous.

881
00:50:44,963 --> 00:50:50,528
Rym: Well, how so like if you're not a single person your high school had a room, bro I mean, I'm sure there were a few also.

882
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:51,613
Scott: that's not what you told me before.

883
00:50:51,653 --> 00:50:53,280
Scott: you told me before is that people in the whole?

884
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:54,600
Scott: Midwest didn't use umbrellas.

885
00:50:54,620 --> 00:51:01,020
Rym: So generally I suspect that in southeast Michigan people tend not to have umbrellas like they do in cities.

886
00:51:01,302 --> 00:51:03,697
Scott: You're modifying the words used before the podcast.

887
00:51:03,717 --> 00:51:13,160
Rym: cuz I was a kid I remember pretty clearly that like when people like we go to the mall like with anyone even I went with like other people's families Or whatever there'd always be the car umbrella and there'd only be one and no one else had an umbrella.

888
00:51:13,592 --> 00:51:22,830
Rym: so Whoever drove would drop everyone off at the front of the mall or wherever we went like the restaurant and they'd go park wherever And then they'd walk in with the only umbrella that that family owned.

889
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:26,688
Rym: and I remember that pretty much always being the case Mm-hmm.

890
00:51:26,829 --> 00:51:35,060
Rym: I don't I very rare I can't remember a time in my life Where I got out of a car with multiple people and multiple of the people getting out of that car had umbrellas.

891
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:39,980
Rym: We're there ran for the door or got whoever drove us to drop us off and assume that it's anyone in the Midwest.

892
00:51:40,201 --> 00:51:42,557
Scott: I need you to basically say the Rym is wrong.

893
00:51:42,577 --> 00:51:45,464
Rym: in southeast Commonly see umbrellas.

894
00:51:45,725 --> 00:51:47,512
Rym: or do you not commonly see umbrellas?

895
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,900
Rym: because I did not commonly see umbrellas.

896
00:51:56,261 --> 00:51:58,508
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
