1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,537
Rym: It's Monday, May 20th, 2013.

2
00:00:10,537 --> 00:00:11,841
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,022 --> 00:00:12,885
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:14,410
Rym: And this is GeekNights tonight.

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,429
Scott: It's a Tech News round of Lazy Boats.

6
00:00:19,931 --> 00:00:20,948
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:24,490
Rym: Actually, it's also because Anime Boston is this weekend.

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,429
Scott: Yeah, you're not going to hear another GeekNights until probably next week.

9
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,549
Rym: Emily and I might do a GeekNights on Shinsekai Ori because we both watched it and it was good.

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,290
Rym: We're done with it and we can do a final thoughts.

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,710
Rym: I don't think Scott's going to watch it, at least in the next six months.

12
00:00:37,931 --> 00:00:43,010
Scott: No, I mean, you know, we made this deal where I would do the one hard panel and you do all the easy panels.

13
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:46,510
Scott: It turns out all the easy panels combined were easier than the one hard panel.

14
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,228
Rym: So I point out, I'm just going to point this out because I'm kind of a fucker.

15
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,170
Rym: But when I brought this up, I was very clear.

16
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:56,270
Rym: I said, so we got five panels and one of them's way harder than the other four.

17
00:00:56,891 --> 00:01:00,990
Rym: So one of us should do all four of the other ones and then one of us should do the fifth one.

18
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:10,370
Rym: And I didn't lie, but I kind of hinted that maybe I wanted to do the short one, hoping that you would take it.

19
00:01:10,911 --> 00:01:13,141
Rym: And then I'd be stuck with the four.

20
00:01:13,422 --> 00:01:14,989
Rym: that took me like two days to do.

21
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,273
Scott: You know, the thing is, I had.

22
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:24,190
Scott: the only reason I took the hard one, you know, was because I had a vision and I didn't want you to have your vision.

23
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,413
Rym: Scott, I have the same vision.

24
00:01:25,514 --> 00:01:31,650
Rym: I have the vision of a clip of that frog, like seeing him and the sit like in the background, all sinister a couple of times.

25
00:01:31,931 --> 00:01:37,410
Rym: And then the parallel clip of that flower from the same angles on the fucking island.

26
00:01:37,775 --> 00:01:38,568
Scott: I got those clips.

27
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:39,254
Rym: Yes.

28
00:01:39,678 --> 00:01:40,910
Rym: Anime Boston is going to be awesome.

29
00:01:41,252 --> 00:01:41,549
Scott: Okay.

30
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:46,610
Scott: So I have these great clips where it's like island, island, island.

31
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,209
Scott: Welcome to me, Bros Island.

32
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:52,849
Scott: What's up with this island?

33
00:01:53,393 --> 00:01:55,810
Rym: I am the second strongest man on me, Bros Island.

34
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,970
Scott: He actually never says you get the third strongest.

35
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,865
Rym: No, you don't get the second.

36
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:00,150
Rym: I remember.

37
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,169
Scott: You don't get the second or the first.

38
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,631
Rym: Yeah.

39
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:03,590
Rym: Well, you know who the second and first are.

40
00:02:03,774 --> 00:02:03,943
Scott: Yeah.

41
00:02:04,732 --> 00:02:05,369
Rym: It's Joy Rock.

42
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,154
Scott: Right.

43
00:02:06,215 --> 00:02:06,664
Scott: But who's the...

44
00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:09,469
Rym: You know what, where Joy Rock's name came from?

45
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:10,529
Scott: No.

46
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,775
Rym: That's some anime trivia.

47
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:14,770
Rym: I'll bring up at the panel that I, I'm scared.

48
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:15,669
Scott: You're proud that you know?

49
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,510
Rym: I am proud that I know this because I learned it from Luke in an era when you couldn't look this up.

50
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,117
Rym: How do you know that?

51
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:22,330
Scott: that's true if you learned it from Luke?

52
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:28,350
Rym: Because in, recently as in like yesterday, I looked it up to make sure it wasn't just bullshit.

53
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,801
Scott: Okay.

54
00:02:30,011 --> 00:02:32,090
Rym: While I was finishing the four other panels.

55
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,610
Scott: Also, by the way, that movie is still pretty funny.

56
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,300
Rym: You know what, Slayers?

57
00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:36,149
Rym: Still pretty good.

58
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:41,730
Scott: I'm telling you, there's some good, it was not, it was not unpleasant to watch that shit.

59
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,617
Rym: So how about that strip search?

60
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:46,230
Rym: before we get into the main bit of this tech news round.

61
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,450
Scott: Shouldn't we talk about that on Wednesday?

62
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,110
Rym: I guess it's interesting that, you know, Emily and I, a while ago, we were talking.

63
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:54,810
Rym: We were talking about how, wow, Scott's really into strip search.

64
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,735
Rym: Like, I like it okay.

65
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,150
Rym: And it's a good show and everyone's, we're all kind of into it.

66
00:02:59,032 --> 00:03:01,890
Scott: I like it because it's honest, right?

67
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,290
Scott: It shows you like, you know, these people that are people just like us, our kind of people, right?

68
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,610
Scott: It's a show made with our kind of people, for our kind of people, by our kind of people.

69
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:17,010
Rym: So Scott, by that logic, the kind of person who's on the Jersey Shore is the kind of person who would enjoy the Jersey Shore.

70
00:03:17,251 --> 00:03:21,950
Rym: It's made for that person by a richer version of that person.

71
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,769
Scott: But that is a horrible person.

72
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:26,829
Scott: We are good people.

73
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,310
Rym: I make no value judgements.

74
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:29,908
Scott: I make those judgements.

75
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,570
Scott: But judge Scott, the discussion.

76
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,027
Scott: Gavel.

77
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,050
Rym: I feel like if we need a super crab people on a Thursday, we could do Judge Grim and Scott.

78
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:39,228
Rym: It'd be a pale simulacrum.

79
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,709
Scott: Judge John Hodgman is far superior.

80
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:41,828
Scott: Just listen to him.

81
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,010
Rym: We would be but a pale simulacrum, a poor homunculus.

82
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:50,650
Scott: What I really want is Judge John Hodgman to find some, you know, dispute between me and Rym and then rule in my favor because I'm right.

83
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,550
Rym: I'm pretty sure he'd rule in my favor regardless of what the dispute was.

84
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:56,910
Scott: I think his gavel of justice would cut through your bullshit.

85
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:01,870
Rym: I think the dispute we would have him go over is which one of us is right about his ruling.

86
00:04:02,571 --> 00:04:02,890
Scott: Anyway.

87
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:15,430
Rym: But what Emily and I were discussing, and a few I've discussed this with a few other people too, was that it appeared because you always expressed a particular disdain for reality shows of any sort.

88
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:22,450
Rym: And when you got into strip search and got way into it, it had a momentum similar to your entrance to My Little Pony.

89
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:30,830
Rym: So we posited merely that this was going to serve as a gateway drug, a marijuana that would then lead you into the harder stuff.

90
00:04:30,931 --> 00:04:32,670
Rym: And what are you watching currently?

91
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,147
Scott: I'm only watching.

92
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,650
Scott: Okay, so I can explain this as well.

93
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:41,609
Rym: So I know you found me on top of a pile of cocaine, but just hear me out.

94
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,401
Scott: Hear me out.

95
00:04:43,442 --> 00:04:44,188
Scott: It's not a bug.

96
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,290
Scott: So I'm not watching anything else stupid.

97
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,130
Rym: Before you know it, it's going to be Honey Boo Boo.

98
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,203
Scott: I don't even know what that is.

99
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,225
Rym: Yes, you do.

100
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,013
Scott: Barely.

101
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:53,183
Scott: I saw it on South Park.

102
00:04:53,224 --> 00:04:53,769
Scott: That's about it.

103
00:04:54,231 --> 00:04:56,470
Scott: That's all I know is what I saw in South Park.

104
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,630
Scott: All right, so Kitchen Nightmares is not stupid, as stupid as the right.

105
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,348
Scott: So here's the thing.

106
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:04,401
Scott: There was that clip that went around Reddit.

107
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:05,830
Scott: I didn't even know the show existed, right?

108
00:05:06,532 --> 00:05:11,290
Scott: And all I knew about Gordon Ramsay was that he was the angry chef guy.

109
00:05:11,673 --> 00:05:14,190
Scott: And I saw him make scrambled eggs once on YouTube, right?

110
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:15,608
Rym: Those are really good scrambled eggs.

111
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:23,010
Scott: Right, so I made those scrambled eggs, and the taste of those scrambled eggs made me think, huh, maybe that angry guy is not so bad with his angriness.

112
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:30,090
Scott: Because goddamn, if his one YouTube video can make me cook fancy restaurant quality eggs, he fucking knows something.

113
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,086
Scott: That guy, right?

114
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:44,490
Scott: So then I saw him, you know, in this video from a show I didn't know existed where he went to some restaurant, and he was supposed to help the people running the restaurant, but they were the shittiest people on Earth.

115
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,470
Rym: Perhaps they watched Jersey Shore.

116
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:55,730
Rym: You know, it's interesting that the internet fallout of that was even, I only knew about this because Darryl Surratt retweeted a picture of the comments related to this.

117
00:05:57,432 --> 00:06:01,429
Scott: So then I was like, all right, what the fuck is this show normally like?

118
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:05,670
Scott: Right, so I went and I saw it was on Netflix randomly.

119
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:14,830
Scott: I wasn't even like going out of my way to find it, but I just, I happened to, I turned on Netflix and I was looking for something to watch, and I saw his face there, and he had a knife, and it was like kitchen nightmares.

120
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,889
Scott: I'm like, oh, let me see what this show is actually normally like.

121
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,410
Rym: And I wasn't really looking for porn, I just turned on the computer.

122
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,550
Rym: And there was porn there, right.

123
00:06:22,931 --> 00:06:27,690
Scott: So I gotta tell you, the US version of the show is actually not that great.

124
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:30,658
Scott: It's sort of like half good and half bad, right?

125
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:48,250
Scott: Half the episode, you're learning about how to run restaurants, you know, you're learning about like, you know, what makes food good or bad, how to buy, you know, how to save money, and you know, the amount you spent, the restaurant costs to like build a dish on the menu versus how much they sell it for.

126
00:06:48,772 --> 00:06:52,350
Scott: And it's actually pretty interesting running a restaurant shit, right?

127
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,130
Rym: You know, it's interesting, how many episodes did you watch?

128
00:06:54,290 --> 00:07:00,610
Rym: Because the fact that you said build as opposed to make is telling as to how much of the lexicon is seeping into your pores.

129
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,290
Scott: My dad works in food service.

130
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,529
Rym: Oh yeah, I always forget that.

131
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,128
Scott: Anyway.

132
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,170
Rym: Can you get us tickets to a game of something?

133
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,369
Scott: What game do you want to go to?

134
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:08,054
Rym: No.

135
00:07:08,453 --> 00:07:08,686
Scott: I know.

136
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,370
Scott: You think if we had hockey tickets, we wouldn't already be?

137
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:19,310
Scott: Anyway, so, but the US one is full of contrived reality show nonsense.

138
00:07:19,591 --> 00:07:24,930
Scott: Like each episode, he'll do like some promotional gimmick to like get people to come to the restaurant.

139
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:29,130
Scott: And like once he had like, it was in Miami and he did like a fashion show outside the restaurant.

140
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:29,943
Scott: It's like, oh, please.

141
00:07:30,086 --> 00:07:30,330
Scott: Right.

142
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:36,490
Scott: Or like he always, he'll always arrive at the restaurant in some ridiculous vehicle, you know, of some kind.

143
00:07:37,051 --> 00:07:45,410
Scott: And he's always, you know, he's yells at people a lot more and they portray it as him being like way angrier and shit and the people being way dumber and complete fuck ups.

144
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:46,192
Scott: What might?

145
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:52,050
Scott: the worst offender of the whole thing was one time they were trying to show how dirty and nasty this kitchen was.

146
00:07:52,218 --> 00:07:52,388
Scott: Yeah.

147
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:56,148
Scott: And while they were like during a meal service, a bowl of rice got knocked over.

148
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:56,570
Scott: Right.

149
00:07:57,271 --> 00:08:02,242
Scott: But if you look at that, why was that camera aiming at that bowl of rice on top of that counter?

150
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,950
Scott: that was just sitting there and it zoomed way in on that bowl of rice.

151
00:08:06,071 --> 00:08:08,709
Scott: And you see like a hand come in and knock it over onto the floor.

152
00:08:09,091 --> 00:08:10,428
Scott: But you don't see whose hand that was.

153
00:08:10,954 --> 00:08:12,590
Scott: And it doesn't look like anyone who works there was.

154
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:16,270
Scott: So clearly the staff of the show knocked over a rice and filmed it.

155
00:08:16,713 --> 00:08:17,480
Scott: And it's like, really?

156
00:08:18,105 --> 00:08:18,569
Scott: Really, guys?

157
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:24,009
Rym: Well, maybe it's like Unsolved Mysteries where that was a reenactment of the thing that happened.

158
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:33,190
Scott: You know, also at the end of every episode, it says, you know, things may have been filmed out of order, you know, so clearly they changed the order of the event.

159
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:37,230
Rym: See, what I don't understand is why do they even need that disclaimer?

160
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,206
Scott: I agree.

161
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:41,347
Rym: Who thinks that a reality show is real?

162
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,150
Scott: There's another.

163
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:49,603
Scott: there's another disclaimer that says how all the people who are eating in the restaurant during that time are basically getting free food paid for by the TV show, which is what.

164
00:08:49,804 --> 00:08:53,510
Scott: which is why, like, you know, when you're in a restaurant, people send food back occasionally.

165
00:08:54,171 --> 00:08:56,307
Scott: But even in a bad restaurant doesn't happen that often.

166
00:08:56,529 --> 00:08:56,710
Scott: Right.

167
00:08:56,891 --> 00:08:59,910
Rym: I've sent maybe two things back in my entire life.

168
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,290
Scott: When you watch this show, it's like everything is coming back constantly.

169
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,842
Scott: And I think it's clearly because they tell the people in the restaurant, we're buying you food.

170
00:09:06,882 --> 00:09:09,150
Scott: if it's no good, send it back, please.

171
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,204
Scott: It's for the drama.

172
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:10,549
Scott: Right.

173
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:17,310
Scott: But I went and I found the UK version, the original because I didn't even realize it was UK version because I didn't even Wikipedia.

174
00:09:17,732 --> 00:09:20,290
Rym: So that locally grown stuff really wasn't doing it for us.

175
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,749
Rym: You started importing direct.

176
00:09:22,652 --> 00:09:25,850
Scott: OK, so the what was I saying?

177
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:26,152
Scott: Right.

178
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,309
Scott: The UK version.

179
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:28,892
Scott: Right.

180
00:09:28,953 --> 00:09:31,850
Scott: During one of the US episodes, he's like, this is my hundredth whatever.

181
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,179
Scott: And I'm like, it's only season two.

182
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:34,165
Scott: How was this your hundredth?

183
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:34,870
Scott: Right.

184
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,277
Scott: And I was like, oh, there were like five seasons in the UK.

185
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:41,950
Scott: So I went and that happened to actually be on Netflix as well.

186
00:09:42,292 --> 00:09:44,430
Scott: Even after I tormented it, I found that it was on Netflix.

187
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:49,750
Rym: I love how even when we pay for Netflix, the instinct is to go straight to the pirate.

188
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:50,293
Scott: Exactly.

189
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,139
Scott: That won't be on Netflix.

190
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,509
Scott: Oh, the UK one actually is there.

191
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:58,890
Scott: The UK one is actually like a quiet documentary kind of thing where it's like he quietly goes into the restaurant.

192
00:09:59,051 --> 00:10:03,870
Scott: He's still like you pieces, you know, but it's more like it comes off as a totally different.

193
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,099
Scott: He's not like a mean, angry, crazy person.

194
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,430
Scott: He's just sort of like, oh, fuck off you pieces.

195
00:10:09,632 --> 00:10:09,813
Scott: Right.

196
00:10:09,873 --> 00:10:14,570
Scott: It's sort of like even though he's saying sort of the same things, like he's a British person with British people.

197
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:15,393
Scott: Right.

198
00:10:15,695 --> 00:10:17,629
Scott: You know, sort of like really come on.

199
00:10:18,111 --> 00:10:18,392
Scott: Right.

200
00:10:19,115 --> 00:10:22,130
Scott: And it's sort of I don't think it's filmed out of order, at least it doesn't.

201
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,770
Scott: It seems to be in his nose sensationalist nonsense.

202
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:27,610
Scott: He just literally and he narrates it himself sort of quietly.

203
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,890
Scott: It's almost like a nature program, only the nature is people fucking up a restaurant.

204
00:10:32,051 --> 00:10:32,553
Rym: Not bad.

205
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:36,150
Scott: It's like, oh, here, watch as the cheetah doesn't know how to cook for shit.

206
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:40,110
Scott: Watch as this waiter can't even remember what is on the menu.

207
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:47,790
Rym: It's funny, not that you would have watched it, but there's actually an episode of Archer where they have a mission where they have to infiltrate a kitchen to protect some diplomat from being poisoned.

208
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,301
Scott: Watch as Archer can't aim that gun for shit.

209
00:10:50,361 --> 00:10:52,050
Rym: And it's basically himself in the foot.

210
00:10:52,211 --> 00:10:55,530
Rym: It's basically Gordon Ramsay, Kitchen Nightmares reality show.

211
00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:00,170
Rym: But it's just because none of them know how to cook and they're all pretending to be the chefs at this fancy restaurant.

212
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,817
Rym: It's actually a pretty good episode.

213
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:04,010
Rym: You might enjoy it if you don't like Archer in general.

214
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,715
Scott: The other thing is in the U.S.

215
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:09,830
Scott: one, it seems clearly there's some sort of thing going on where.

216
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:16,444
Scott: You know, he basically, what was I saying?

217
00:11:17,025 --> 00:11:18,550
Scott: I got a beep on my phone, so I got distracted.

218
00:11:18,771 --> 00:11:19,390
Rym: I wonder what that was.

219
00:11:19,611 --> 00:11:20,693
Scott: Yeah, the U.S.

220
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:20,994
Scott: one.

221
00:11:21,255 --> 00:11:27,570
Scott: It seems like they have a deal with the restaurants, like they basically save the restaurants by infusing a ton of money into them.

222
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:27,791
Scott: Right.

223
00:11:27,831 --> 00:11:30,442
Scott: They everyone gets a renovation of their front of the house.

224
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,210
Scott: Everyone gets like new stoves.

225
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:37,370
Rym: So they basically pay you like, all right, here's the money to cover the fact that you're going to get the worst possible publicity.

226
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:43,690
Scott: Instead of paying them to be on the show, they basically invest money in the restaurant as payment for being on the show.

227
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:50,810
Scott: And right in the UK one, literally, it's just like him and a few cameras go to the restaurant and he works with them all week helping them.

228
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:51,513
Scott: Right.

229
00:11:52,017 --> 00:11:53,949
Scott: You know, and that's what you get is you get help.

230
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,421
Rym: So the moral is when Running Man comes to the U.S.

231
00:11:57,763 --> 00:11:59,229
Rym: bastardized, we shouldn't watch it.

232
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:01,720
Scott: Running Man is not a reality show.

233
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,724
Scott: It's a variety show.

234
00:12:03,528 --> 00:12:03,930
Scott: It's different.

235
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,476
Scott: It's not the same.

236
00:12:05,496 --> 00:12:06,142
Scott: It is.

237
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:06,970
Scott: It's not even close.

238
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,412
Rym: I'm not.

239
00:12:07,634 --> 00:12:08,820
Rym: I'm not saying you're wrong.

240
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,569
Rym: I'm laughing for other reasons.

241
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:15,383
Rym: This was all foretold in the book of strip search.

242
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:17,070
Scott: I'm not smoking cocaine.

243
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:18,793
Scott: It's just.

244
00:12:19,154 --> 00:12:20,680
Scott: it's still still just weed.

245
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,350
Scott: There's more weed, different kinds of weed.

246
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:23,750
Scott: So

247
00:12:24,031 --> 00:12:39,550
Rym: since we're doing a tech news roundup and there's no real news, I do want to talk about something because I realized that most of you out there who want to be Linux administrators or IT guys or developers, a lot of GeekNights' people, you guys who listen, have aspirations.

248
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,562
Rym: A lot of you are in high school of going to college or you're in college.

249
00:12:42,582 --> 00:12:44,530
Rym: You have aspirations of having the kind of job I have.

250
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:53,610
Rym: I'm going to give you all some homework right now because I realize that nobody coming out of college fucking knows even the most basic network system administration stuff.

251
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,301
Rym: This is the kind of thing that should be second nature.

252
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,370
Rym: And also, it's a really useful tool.

253
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:00,334
Rym: My homework for you is very simple.

254
00:13:00,835 --> 00:13:07,810
Rym: You are not a system administrator of any stripe unless you can get MRTG, which is a really simple little thing.

255
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,430
Rym: You know, those graphs, like you look at a college, you're like, I wonder how fast their Internet is.

256
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:17,810
Rym: And there's always this like green and blue graph that's like hidden somewhere on the website, like the computer science department links to it.

257
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:24,910
Scott: Or like you log into your line node and it's all these graphs of like CPU usage and it goes like this green blob, you know, this wiggling up and down.

258
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,649
Scott: It shows you how much your CPU has been used.

259
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,111
Rym: Yep.

260
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:41,930
Rym: Now, MRTG is one of the primus tools in this essay or a network administrator's handbook, because it basically lets you track arbitrary amounts of data without increasing amounts of storage necessary to keep that data.

261
00:13:42,191 --> 00:13:47,070
Rym: Because as data gets old, it aggregates into into basically sparser data points.

262
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:47,552
Scott: Right.

263
00:13:47,652 --> 00:13:48,295
Scott: So think about it.

264
00:13:48,335 --> 00:13:51,990
Scott: If you were going to, say, track your CPU usage for the year, right?

265
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:58,790
Scott: Well, you're going to have three hundred and sixty five times as much data as you do on the last day of the year as you did on the first day.

266
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:04,210
Rym: So say you take your system load, you know, per core, every second you take an average of that second.

267
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,835
Rym: So you have a data point every second.

268
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:10,330
Rym: And maybe for the entire current day, you keep all those seconds because it's not just like 80 something.

269
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,933
Rym: That's not that many data points.

270
00:14:12,674 --> 00:14:20,630
Rym: But then you take the average of, say, the hours or 20 minute intervals and use that to populate a week long graph.

271
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:25,390
Rym: Take the averages of entire days to make year long graphs.

272
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:30,910
Rym: And you can see that it's really easy to visualize trends in data usage over time.

273
00:14:31,511 --> 00:14:33,237
Rym: And there are many other tools that do this.

274
00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:37,350
Rym: And the reason I bring up MRTG is that it's so commonly used.

275
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,511
Rym: It's the simplest one.

276
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:54,210
Rym: And if you want to prove that you know how to administer systems, all you need to do to prove that to me is take MRTG and get it to monitor any Linux server's CPU and memory usage and have that graph appear.

277
00:14:54,591 --> 00:15:07,670
Rym: So if you will learn more about IT and system administration by making MRTG monitor your Linux servers CPU and memory than you will by just about any other thing you could do in any class you could go to in college.

278
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:14,109
Scott: And if you happen to be interviewed by Rym for a job and you have MRTG on your resume and he asks you, "Oh, you wrote this on your resume.

279
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:14,430
Scott: What is

280
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:14,490
Scott: it?".

281
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:19,609
Scott: And you actually know what the fuck it is and can actually, you know, convince him that you know what the hell it is.

282
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,781
Scott: Probably not going to need to ask you any more questions.

283
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:23,310
Scott: He'll believe that you just know everything else.

284
00:15:23,611 --> 00:15:25,055
Rym: I will ask you one other question.

285
00:15:25,136 --> 00:15:29,590
Rym: If you think you're an administrator, I would ask you what a quadruple A record is in DNS.

286
00:15:30,912 --> 00:15:31,998
Scott: I don't even know that.

287
00:15:32,562 --> 00:15:33,950
Scott: I know what a 1A record is.

288
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:34,810
Rym: What's a 1A record?

289
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,210
Scott: It's just you map up a name to an IP address.

290
00:15:38,891 --> 00:15:41,230
Rym: So a quadruple A record is just four A's.

291
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,949
Scott: I know that, but what is the difference between a 4A's and a 1A?

292
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:44,813
Rym: IPv6.

293
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:45,719
Rym: That's all.

294
00:15:45,739 --> 00:15:46,183
Scott: That's all.

295
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:48,612
Scott: There you go.

296
00:15:49,576 --> 00:15:50,058
Scott: Now I know.

297
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:52,728
Scott: How do you format the IPv6 address?

298
00:15:52,748 --> 00:15:53,310
Scott: Just the same way?

299
00:15:53,515 --> 00:15:53,988
Rym: Yeah, same way.

300
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,461
Scott: And you just have normal DNS.

301
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:56,270
Scott: It's not like...

302
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,105
Rym: Yeah, DNS maps...

303
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,132
Scott: It'd be like IPv6.

304
00:15:58,252 --> 00:16:00,116
Scott: It'd be like frontrowcrew.com.

305
00:16:00,136 --> 00:16:06,310
Scott: It'd be like .ipv6 and then it would be, you know, A and then an IPv6 address.

306
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,550
Rym: Yeah, it's the same format as a regular A record.

307
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,376
Scott: Now, what if I use like, you know, IPv6?

308
00:16:10,396 --> 00:16:14,490
Scott: Do I have to put the full fucking address or can I use like colon, colon, colon, colon, colon, colon?

309
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:22,770
Rym: I'm pretty sure you can do colon, colon, but don't quote me on that because I'm not 100% sure how Vine would handle it because I've never actually bothered to set up.

310
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,169
Scott: Actually, a set of addresses, not one, right?

311
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:30,910
Rym: Well, it depends on what kind of... We're already getting deeper than I would ask on a resume.

312
00:16:32,432 --> 00:16:33,008
Scott: So you'd hire me?

313
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:43,190
Rym: Yeah, you are a more competent server administrator than most people I've ever met with whom I was asking questions in the hopes of hiring to be a system administrator.

314
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,389
Scott: I'll work for you for half a million dollars a year.

315
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:47,347
Scott: Yeah, no.

316
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:47,798
Scott: No?

317
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:48,068
Scott: Okay.

318
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,307
Rym: I'd forgive you a quarter of that.

319
00:16:51,031 --> 00:16:52,325
Rym: Half?

320
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:52,750
Rym: Anyway.

321
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,630
Scott: Forty vacation days?

322
00:17:00,358 --> 00:17:00,950
Rym: Thought you had a thing.

323
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:01,692
Scott: A thing?

324
00:17:01,793 --> 00:17:02,883
Scott: Oh, a thing of the day.

325
00:17:02,964 --> 00:17:03,590
Scott: I actually forgot it.

326
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,630
Scott: No, I didn't say things of the day.

327
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:04,854
Scott: Oh.

328
00:17:10,271 --> 00:17:11,709
Rym: Alright, I guess now we can do things of the day.

329
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:16,329
Scott: I completely forgot it about things of the day, but I actually have one prepared in my delicious.

330
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,249
Rym: I don't, so I'm going to find one while you pull it up.

331
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:25,790
Scott: So what this is, is a Flickr gallery, which I remembered that I had delicioused because we were talking about Flickr.

332
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,347
Rym: Wow, Flickr gallery, that you delicioused.

333
00:17:28,795 --> 00:17:28,945
Scott: Yep.

334
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,009
Rym: Don't you mean a Yahoo gallery that you Yahooed?

335
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,990
Scott: Well, delicious isn't owned by Yahoo anymore.

336
00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:36,157
Rym: Oh, yeah, right.

337
00:17:36,197 --> 00:17:38,150
Rym: It's basically... Well, let's see what happens with delicious.

338
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:38,550
Scott: Yeah.

339
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:47,110
Scott: But anyway, what this is, is somebody found a set of old Japanese manco cards from the 50s, and they're totally amazing.

340
00:17:47,231 --> 00:17:51,649
Scott: It's like looking at old baseball cards of Japan with crazy, awesome characters on them.

341
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,745
Scott: It's totally fucking sweet, this robot.

342
00:17:53,846 --> 00:17:54,230
Scott: Oh, shit.

343
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,770
Scott: It's like if I could get these cards, like maybe like a big version of some of these to put on the wall.

344
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:00,860
Scott: Oh, man, that'd be so awesome.

345
00:18:01,142 --> 00:18:02,290
Scott: But I guess not.

346
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:06,047
Scott: But in the meantime, you can look at them in this high-res Flickr photo.

347
00:18:06,248 --> 00:18:06,610
Scott: Oh, sweet.

348
00:18:08,412 --> 00:18:11,130
Rym: So I got two really short, dumb things of the day.

349
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:11,570
Scott: Okay.

350
00:18:12,212 --> 00:18:17,910
Rym: One is a mash-up of that Titan anime that you guys don't need to know anything about.

351
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,810
Scott: That I haven't watched yet.

352
00:18:18,992 --> 00:18:19,470
Rym: I haven't either.

353
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:20,610
Scott: Titan Attack on Titan?

354
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:20,866
Scott: Yeah.

355
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,509
Scott: It's the popular anime right now.

356
00:18:23,931 --> 00:18:24,430
Rym: Ew, Tana.

357
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,151
Rym: Forget all.

358
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:31,149
Rym: Anyway, so someone mashed it up effectively with initial D.

359
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:31,853
Scott: Oh.

360
00:18:32,492 --> 00:18:33,109
Scott: And this is horrifying.

361
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:34,428
Scott: Maybe I should watch it now.

362
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,790
Rym: Horrifyingly, deliciously hilarious.

363
00:18:38,194 --> 00:18:38,348
Rym: Okay.

364
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:47,450
Rym: So I made this a thing of the day, specifically on a non-Wednesday, because I want normal people to watch this video and just wonder why, wonder how, what this is.

365
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,690
Scott: You said you had two things of the day.

366
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,588
Rym: It's my real thing of the day.

367
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,490
Rym: Tobias Fueke, you may know from Arrested Development, which is a pretty funny show.

368
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,470
Scott: I hear he's making a comeback.

369
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:59,870
Rym: So in the lead-up to the new season of Arrested Development, he has his sizzle reel.

370
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:06,530
Rym: And what I have here is him auditioning to be on Bravest Warriors.

371
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:07,104
Rym: What?

372
00:19:08,132 --> 00:19:12,510
Scott: That is the craziest combination that I would never have predicted in a million years.

373
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:13,268
Scott: Wait, wait.

374
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,730
Scott: So is this something made by some fan?

375
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,070
Scott: You need more details.

376
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,150
Rym: So this is on Cartoon Hangover.

377
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:20,606
Scott: Okay.

378
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:22,850
Scott: So it's something the Bravest Warriors people got him.

379
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:30,429
Rym: But the manner in which it is done is great because he is- What character is he trying to be?

380
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:31,110
Rym: Okay.

381
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:32,969
Rym: So I'm going to spoil the joke for you.

382
00:19:33,591 --> 00:19:36,605
Rym: He presents like, "I'm going to audition to be on Bravest

383
00:19:36,645 --> 00:19:37,067
Rym: Warriors."

384
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,930
Rym: And then his reel is him superimposed into the show, not talking.

385
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:45,890
Rym: So it's like him in the background playing catch.

386
00:19:47,111 --> 00:19:50,050
Scott: Is there actually an episode of Bravest Warriors that's going on while this happens?

387
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:51,789
Rym: Yeah, but it's all episodes we've seen.

388
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,529
Rym: He basically inserts himself into- About cabbage?

389
00:19:54,771 --> 00:19:55,430
Rym: Old episodes.

390
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,790
Rym: Yeah, butter lettuce makes an appearance.

391
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:58,649
Rym: Butter lettuce!

392
00:19:58,972 --> 00:19:59,889
Rym: Butter lettuce party!

393
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,590
Scott: So apparently it's a Bravest Warriors comic.

394
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:02,469
Scott: I'm waiting for trades.

395
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:02,573
Scott: Ooh.

396
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,550
Scott: Yep.

397
00:20:04,173 --> 00:20:05,290
Rym: I'm kind of excited about that.

398
00:20:05,794 --> 00:20:07,310
Scott: I got Adventure Time trade number one.

399
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:07,801
Scott: Yeah?

400
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,589
Scott: It's Adventure Time.

401
00:20:08,951 --> 00:20:10,830
Rym: Yeah, I've got a bunch of the Adventure Time comics.

402
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,330
Rym: They're great.

403
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:11,787
Scott: Yeah.

404
00:20:12,918 --> 00:20:13,110
Scott: Okay.

405
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,049
Scott: It's a lot like Simpsons comics.

406
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:15,726
Rym: Yeah.

407
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:22,790
Rym: It's got that nice blend of low key humor and sort of the background jokes and all those things that I like about that kind of comic.

408
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,710
Rym: So it's the Tech News Roundup, but first, in that moment- Anime Boston.

409
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:31,450
Scott: We're not going to talk about that in the show again until next year maybe.

410
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,449
Scott: This weekend.

411
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:45,310
Rym: The only thing I have to say about it is if you weren't paying attention to non-anime normal news, but somehow you listen to GeekNights, one, there's a huge train collision that has basically fucked Amtrak.

412
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:49,190
Scott: As of Dateline now- Hasn't it also sort of fucked Metro North New Haven line?

413
00:20:49,971 --> 00:20:51,750
Rym: As of now, Amtrak is not unfucked.

414
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:56,969
Rym: So if you're taking Amtrak to- As of when I checked a little while ago- Okay.

415
00:20:57,151 --> 00:21:02,909
Rym: All I'm saying is double check that Amtrak will get you there if you planned to take Amtrak.

416
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:03,849
Scott: We're using Bolt Bus, right?

417
00:21:04,051 --> 00:21:04,770
Rym: We're using Bolt Bus.

418
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:05,310
Scott: You got my ticket?

419
00:21:05,491 --> 00:21:05,968
Rym: I got your ticket.

420
00:21:07,171 --> 00:21:16,770
Rym: Two, they've instituted the MCCA against Anime Boston's wishes a mandatory sort of city run bag inspection at all entrances.

421
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,188
Scott: This might be the end.

422
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,930
Rym: All I'm saying is- I foresee doom.

423
00:21:23,153 --> 00:21:36,849
Rym: I got a pretty awful response from them from my press inquiry that we're not going to really cover this unless it's disaster, but I'm just warning you, be ready for possible lines getting into the con.

424
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:37,265
Scott: Yup.

425
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:45,708
Scott: And plan, at least on the Friday while you see how it is, to go into the con and not come out until the end.

426
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,330
Rym: Problem is you can't even get into the mall to eat.

427
00:21:48,593 --> 00:21:48,927
Scott: I know.

428
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:49,590
Scott: Anyway.

429
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:50,230
Rym: Anyway.

430
00:21:50,631 --> 00:22:01,390
Rym: But if it does prove a problem, rest assured, I will make sure that those who are responsible for the problem are held fully accountable in the eyes of the internet, unforgetting and unfeeling.

431
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,050
Scott: Other meta moments.

432
00:22:04,471 --> 00:22:07,030
Scott: The book is still the player of games.

433
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,790
Scott: I've actually fucking finished it like weeks ago.

434
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:10,590
Rym: I'm going to start reading it on the bus to Anime Boston.

435
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,269
Scott: I'm reading the book that came before it.

436
00:22:14,535 --> 00:22:15,029
Scott: Don't worry.

437
00:22:15,391 --> 00:22:21,930
Scott: Even though the player of games is the second book in a series, it is not like Prince of Nothing, where it is a serial series.

438
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:23,610
Scott: I guess any right.

439
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,890
Scott: It is simply books that take place in the same universe.

440
00:22:27,153 --> 00:22:28,470
Rym: Well, you know, you could argue.

441
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,429
Scott: And I had a full on.

442
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:29,949
Scott: I did not.

443
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,483
Scott: You know, there is nothing in that first book that gave.

444
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:36,930
Scott: that would have, you know, really was necessary at all to understand that second book.

445
00:22:37,071 --> 00:22:39,750
Scott: So something you can read player of games without reading.

446
00:22:40,112 --> 00:22:41,568
Scott: Consider Phlebas and you will be OK.

447
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:46,890
Rym: Would you still consider a series serial if the episodes were aired out of order on purpose?

448
00:22:47,472 --> 00:22:47,869
Scott: Like Haruhi?

449
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:48,588
Rym: Like Haruhi.

450
00:22:48,938 --> 00:22:49,267
Scott: I don't know.

451
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,088
Scott: What order should you watch Haruhi in?

452
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,330
Rym: Watch it in the broadcast order, I guess.

453
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:53,930
Rym: Doesn't matter.

454
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:54,670
Scott: Doesn't matter.

455
00:22:55,452 --> 00:23:02,950
Rym: I think the broadcast order is better than the chronological order just because it gives you that kind of baccano feeling and it kind of it has a better pacing.

456
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:03,362
Scott: OK.

457
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,190
Rym: But it doesn't really matter.

458
00:23:06,372 --> 00:23:09,269
Rym: It's interesting that you still don't know the primary conceit of that show.

459
00:23:10,251 --> 00:23:10,670
Scott: I thought I did.

460
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:13,450
Scott: It was the girls looking for aliens, which is the crazy one.

461
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,349
Scott: But everyone else is the alien, but not her.

462
00:23:15,754 --> 00:23:15,842
Rym: Yeah.

463
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,830
Rym: That's that's not really what the show is about.

464
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,245
Scott: OK.

465
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,009
Scott: And it's time travel of some kind.

466
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,829
Rym: I mean, you think initialties about the cars.

467
00:23:22,092 --> 00:23:22,670
Rym: It's about haws.

468
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,830
Rym: You think antennas about people.

469
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:24,705
Rym: It's about cars.

470
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:26,910
Scott: Did you see that?

471
00:23:27,152 --> 00:23:28,170
Scott: Did you see that picture?

472
00:23:28,771 --> 00:23:28,897
Scott: Yeah.

473
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,609
Scott: Some Sailor Moon S or whatever it is.

474
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,207
Rym: So, the tech news round up.

475
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:37,488
Scott: Round up.

476
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:38,246
Scott: Round up.

477
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:38,947
Rym: Weeds killed it.

478
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,050
Rym: I want to start with some.

479
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:41,530
Rym: It is science and technology.

480
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,830
Rym: We don't talk enough about science.

481
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:47,790
Rym: The FDA is actually looking into, for real, regulating triclosan.

482
00:23:48,491 --> 00:23:50,468
Rym: And I don't think any of you know or care what that is.

483
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:57,390
Rym: But basically, all that antibacterial soap that everyone uses that's so ineffective and doesn't do anything is a waste of money.

484
00:23:58,051 --> 00:24:01,950
Rym: Well, the FDA is starting to say that, hey, maybe this is ineffective and doesn't actually do anything.

485
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:02,728
Rym: It's a waste of money.

486
00:24:03,051 --> 00:24:06,450
Scott: Well, the thing is, you know, we're talking about the soaps you wash your hands with, right?

487
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:11,870
Scott: Those Purells, I think some of them might have triclosan, but they also just have fucking rubbing alcohol in them.

488
00:24:12,496 --> 00:24:13,790
Scott: Nothing wrong with rubbing alcohol.

489
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:22,130
Rym: I've read so many studies saying that using consumer grade hand sanitizers has basically zero effect on disease transmission.

490
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,189
Scott: I'm not saying they have an effect.

491
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:25,870
Rym: There are hand sanitizers that are effective.

492
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,508
Rym: I used to use them.

493
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,950
Rym: You know what happens when you use them?

494
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:29,589
Scott: Your hands burn.

495
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,450
Rym: You don't have fingerprints anymore.

496
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:37,690
Rym: My fingerprint reader on my laptop stopped working when I worked at the hospital because I no longer had a fingerprint.

497
00:24:39,135 --> 00:24:41,730
Scott: But yeah, I don't ever use the Purell shit, right?

498
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:48,310
Scott: But I don't specifically seek out antibacterial soap, but triclosan, I just wash my hands with whatever soap is there.

499
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:55,610
Rym: But the FDA is investigating a lot of data saying that not only is triclosan encouraging bacteria to be resistant to it.

500
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,889
Scott: Even I've known that for years.

501
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:01,910
Rym: But it also might have hormonal effects on humans and may be considered toxic.

502
00:25:02,011 --> 00:25:03,289
Scott: I did not know that until today.

503
00:25:03,631 --> 00:25:04,869
Rym: So there's an article on it.

504
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,050
Rym: The FDA is going to release some rulings on it in the near future.

505
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:13,470
Scott: Can we short sell on some soap companies or has that basically already had an effect?

506
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:14,655
Rym: I don't know.

507
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:15,629
Rym: I didn't look into that.

508
00:25:16,712 --> 00:25:21,370
Rym: I don't invest in those kinds of sectors because I'm not up enough on the inside baseball.

509
00:25:21,591 --> 00:25:22,230
Scott: You don't know about soap?

510
00:25:22,931 --> 00:25:23,549
Rym: I don't know about soap.

511
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,230
Scott: I guess Procter & Gamble makes a fuck ton of soap, right?

512
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:28,950
Rym: I know that soap is a really slow way to send messages to a system.

513
00:25:29,351 --> 00:25:29,950
Scott: You know what I learned?

514
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,149
Scott: Here's a related thing that I know.

515
00:25:32,471 --> 00:25:36,330
Scott: Alright, so I was taking CPR training and one of the questions we had.

516
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,908
Rym: I was wondering if you're going to be like XMLRPC.

517
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:46,190
Scott: And one of the questions we had to answer is that when you're washing your hands, what is the most important thing in determining how clean your hands are actually going to get?

518
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,270
Scott: A. The temperature of the water.

519
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:48,483
Scott: Nope.

520
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,349
Scott: B. The soap.

521
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:50,946
Rym: Nope.

522
00:25:51,935 --> 00:25:53,130
Scott: C. The friction.

523
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,170
Rym: Well, it depends.

524
00:25:55,351 --> 00:25:57,270
Rym: Is D. The amount of time spent?

525
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,270
Scott: Well, it's, you know, yeah, pretty much.

526
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:11,130
Rym: Because the protocols, like when I was in the hospital and I would go into the neonatal care ward to do whatever work, I would wash my hands up to the elbow for a full two minutes and 30 seconds.

527
00:26:11,631 --> 00:26:11,812
Scott: Right.

528
00:26:11,832 --> 00:26:15,170
Scott: See, it's all about, right, the soap only matters barely.

529
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:18,550
Rym: And washing meant rubbing my hands against each other like this constantly.

530
00:26:18,815 --> 00:26:18,990
Rym: Yes.

531
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,469
Rym: To the point that they got hot and hurt.

532
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,143
Scott: The friction is what matters.

533
00:26:22,204 --> 00:26:22,830
Scott: How long.

534
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,708
Rym: That could be said about many human endeavors.

535
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,670
Scott: Covering all the possible skin areas.

536
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,686
Rym: That could also be said about many human endeavors.

537
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:34,290
Rym: I cover all the possible skin areas with constant friction.

538
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,140
Scott: Lots of friction for a long period of time.

539
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:37,690
Scott: That is what makes your hands clean.

540
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,605
Rym: Maybe not that long of a period of time.

541
00:26:40,645 --> 00:26:41,510
Rym: You can only go so long.

542
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,739
Scott: But the other things matter hardly at all compared to that factor.

543
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,869
Rym: And you just didn't even acknowledge it.

544
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:59,449
Scott: So if you care about getting your hands clean after you touch something dirty, you know, when you're touching dirty things, then make sure you apply lots of friction for a long time.

545
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:03,243
Rym: So there, we did some science.

546
00:27:03,684 --> 00:27:05,210
Rym: Now we're going to talk about a whole bunch of business stuff.

547
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,530
Scott: I'm going to try to make it as technological as possible.

548
00:27:10,812 --> 00:27:11,969
Scott: Even though it's mostly business news.

549
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:16,770
Rym: So the rumor over the weekend was that either Facebook or Yahoo was going to ruin Tumblr.

550
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,880
Rym: And it ends up that Yahoo won the contest.

551
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,610
Rym: They're the ones who are going to ruin Tumblr.

552
00:27:21,377 --> 00:27:22,150
Scott: Hooray, I guess.

553
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:28,809
Rym: I love how the media, like the mainstream media, is actually reporting, "Yes, Yahoo says they won't ruin

554
00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:28,909
Rym: it.".

555
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,255
Scott: Let me tell you something.

556
00:27:30,557 --> 00:27:33,090
Scott: I've worked for two different companies that were acquired.

557
00:27:33,271 --> 00:27:35,562
Scott: And I remained working at both of them afterwards.

558
00:27:35,602 --> 00:27:37,070
Scott: In fact, I'm still working at one of them, right?

559
00:27:37,611 --> 00:27:43,614
Scott: And whenever you are acquired, the company that is buying you, right, is going to say, "Nothing's going to change.

560
00:27:43,715 --> 00:27:45,301
Scott: Carry on, carry on.

561
00:27:45,602 --> 00:27:46,485
Scott: Don't worry.

562
00:27:46,585 --> 00:27:47,328
Scott: Everything's going to be

563
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:47,830
Scott: awesome.".

564
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:51,670
Scott: And they basically say anything to assuage any fear that you may have.

565
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,521
Scott: And 100% of the time, they are 100% lying.

566
00:27:55,271 --> 00:27:57,609
Scott: They bought you because they want to do something different with you.

567
00:27:58,012 --> 00:28:01,270
Scott: And once they get their hands on you, they own you and they do whatever the fuck they want.

568
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:06,126
Scott: And nothing they said in some promise means a shit.

569
00:28:06,146 --> 00:28:07,110
Scott: You can't hold them to that.

570
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:07,551
Scott: That's why

571
00:28:07,591 --> 00:28:23,290
Rym: at least the company I worked for before had a poison pill, where basically if the company was bought out, it was awesome for the employees because it put such onerous requirements on them to pay ridiculous severance packages to basically prevent anyone from buying us out who wasn't going to do what we wanted anyway.

572
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:23,491
Rym: Yeah.

573
00:28:23,671 --> 00:28:31,150
Scott: I mean, just today, Dave Weiner, the RSS-inventing guy, posted a story about how he was once acquired by Yahoo, right?

574
00:28:31,631 --> 00:28:34,069
Rym: I think at one point everyone's been acquired by Yahoo.

575
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,861
Scott: Or it might have been Google or something.

576
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,070
Scott: Someone bought him, right?

577
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:45,089
Scott: And, you know, they basically, you know, while he was being bought, they told him, "Yeah, you'll be head of web strategy, whatever, whatever," right?

578
00:28:45,431 --> 00:28:46,237
Scott: And he was like, "Sweet.

579
00:28:46,298 --> 00:28:46,681
Scott: Okay.".

580
00:28:46,882 --> 00:28:47,709
Scott: So he agreed to it.

581
00:28:48,071 --> 00:28:54,310
Scott: And then he talks about how he set up a meeting, right, to talk about, oh, I think it was like Symantec, maybe, or McAfee.

582
00:28:54,951 --> 00:28:57,320
Scott: And how, you know, to present the web strategy.

583
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,710
Scott: And only the president was showed up and no one else showed up.

584
00:29:00,231 --> 00:29:02,949
Scott: And he was sort of like, you know, "Where the fuck is

585
00:29:02,989 --> 00:29:03,030
Scott: he?".

586
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:06,127
Scott: You know, when he started, the guy basically stopped him and was like, "All right, it's enough of

587
00:29:06,168 --> 00:29:06,308
Scott: that.".

588
00:29:06,771 --> 00:29:08,037
Scott: And he's like, "But what the fuck?

589
00:29:08,077 --> 00:29:10,409
Scott: I was supposed to be the chief of web strategy,

590
00:29:10,429 --> 00:29:10,670
Scott: whatever.".

591
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,282
Scott: He's like, "Yeah, we just told you that so you would agree to be acquired.

592
00:29:13,684 --> 00:29:14,789
Scott: What the fuck do you think this

593
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:14,890
Scott: is?".

594
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:15,893
Scott: Right?

595
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:17,718
Scott: This is how the business world works.

596
00:29:17,738 --> 00:29:22,070
Scott: When a company buys another company, they will fuck it up eventually, right?

597
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:25,837
Scott: The only counter examples we have to this are Disney.

598
00:29:25,857 --> 00:29:31,850
Scott: What Disney likes to do when they buy people, right, is let them roll for a while, right?

599
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,253
Scott: And then fuck them up, right?

600
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:34,575
Scott: It's like Disney buys Marvel.

601
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:42,550
Scott: They just let the status quo continue into, like, all the contracts and pre-extending agreements that Marvel had sort of expire.

602
00:29:43,011 --> 00:29:52,130
Scott: And thus, you know, sort of open up the freedom for Disney to do what they want with it without, you know, fucking anyone over or breaking any deals or causing any legal troubles, right?

603
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:57,770
Scott: So, like, if Disney buys you, yeah, shit will continue, you know, as it has for about a year and then you're fucked.

604
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:04,570
Scott: So, considering Tumblr makes no money, Yahoo makes no money, Yahoo buys Tumblr, they're gonna fuck it up.

605
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,169
Scott: So, they might actually, it's possible they can make it better, right?

606
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,392
Rym: The thing is, here's what worries me.

607
00:30:09,733 --> 00:30:19,010
Rym: Tumblr is the refuge of artists, pornographers, and kids who want to have a way to share stuff that isn't mom book.

608
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:24,450
Rym: Because Facebook has mom on it now and the kids can't talk about the things they actually want to talk about.

609
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:33,950
Rym: Tumblr has the sort of combination of being a blog and a social network and being semi-anonymous and not tied to the Facebook that their mom and dad in school all know about.

610
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:43,930
Scott: It also sort of has, you know, unlike Facebook and other things where, like, your Tumbles are tied to people, right, like Google Plus, you can just have one account and make a bunch of Tumbles, right?

611
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:47,010
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I have the Radio Free Equestria one just in there and Tumblr.

612
00:30:47,811 --> 00:30:55,490
Scott: And the one thing that Tumblr has that no one else has is sort of, like, something.tumblr.com, like, I have pixelmeet.tumblr.com.

613
00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:00,790
Rym: You realize that something something.tumblr.com replaced the "That's the name of my cover band" joke.

614
00:31:01,051 --> 00:31:04,650
Scott: Exactly, it's like obscurevideogames.tumblr.com.

615
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:12,728
Rym: I'm actually, I started Go Pro-ing every morning and as soon as I get enough, I'm going to start a Tumblr that something along the lines of "Jackass is riding the wrong way in one way bike

616
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:12,948
Rym: lanes."

617
00:31:13,109 --> 00:31:13,650
Rym: Tumblr.com.

618
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,976
Scott: Right, it's just a collection of specific things.

619
00:31:16,036 --> 00:31:21,089
Scott: It's almost like supercut of somethingintheworld.tumblr.com.

620
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:23,032
Rym: Where is it?

621
00:31:23,052 --> 00:31:23,433
Rym: Where is it?

622
00:31:23,453 --> 00:31:24,054
Rym: Did someone make it?

623
00:31:24,094 --> 00:31:30,670
Rym: Someone made a Tumblr that was "African American women wearing Google Glass" and there's no entries to prove a point.

624
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:35,890
Rym: Because someone else, because someone else made the Tumblr of white men wearing Google Glass.

625
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:41,837
Scott: That's Tumblr, so that whole thing could be ruined.

626
00:31:41,877 --> 00:31:44,483
Scott: But, like, for now, they're saying all the right things.

627
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,648
Scott: They're saying, like, "Oh, we're not going to take the porn off Tumblr.

628
00:31:46,668 --> 00:31:47,570
Scott: Nope, we're not going to ruin

629
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:47,630
Scott: it.".

630
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,590
Rym: Okay, don't actually try to search for that because I just found a lot of porn.

631
00:31:51,932 --> 00:31:52,052
Scott: Right.

632
00:31:52,413 --> 00:32:00,290
Scott: But, like I said, companies that are buying other companies say the right thing in the period before and after the acquisition.

633
00:32:00,911 --> 00:32:11,290
Scott: So that A) the people who are being acquired will agree to it and B) they don't create an immediate PR nightmare, right, if they start changing things, you know, while everyone is paying attention to that.

634
00:32:12,393 --> 00:32:12,988
Scott: No, they just started.

635
00:32:16,112 --> 00:32:19,378
Scott: Right, so as soon as, you know, they acquire someone, they're in the news.

636
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:21,982
Scott: They don't want that news to be accompanied with bad PR news.

637
00:32:22,002 --> 00:32:26,230
Scott: They'll wait for another time period to put in the second news of we're changing everything.

638
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:36,990
Rym: Now, that is why this is interesting because Yahoo, you know, they all announced that this Tumblr acquisition is happening and then immediately has the Flickr announcement that they're updating Flickr.

639
00:32:37,651 --> 00:32:40,590
Scott: And then, unlike Google, they updated it immediately.

640
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:45,868
Rym: I know, we both immediately were like, "All right, I went to my Flickr and just like, 'Hey, everything's different now,'.

641
00:32:45,888 --> 00:32:46,249
Rym: but not

642
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:46,450
Rym: really.".

643
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:51,290
Scott: Yeah, when Google updated Google Plus, you know, like earlier in the week, that shit wasn't updated until the end of the day.

644
00:32:51,751 --> 00:32:52,153
Rym: Well, you know why?

645
00:32:52,173 --> 00:32:53,198
Rym: You know why that is?

646
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:55,830
Rym: Yahoo only has, what, like four users to deal with?

647
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:03,600
Scott: Seriously, Google, you can just update your shit everywhere instantly at the same moment as your I/O press conference thingy.

648
00:33:03,841 --> 00:33:12,660
Rym: But that's telling because remember, Yahoo's under new management and it takes a long time for that change in management to trickle down and actually have an effect on the things the company does.

649
00:33:13,341 --> 00:33:20,360
Rym: The fact that Yahoo, you know, with Flickr, I was pretty much afraid for the last three years that they were going to shut Flickr down.

650
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,480
Scott: Like they fucked up Delicious?

651
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,462
Rym: Yeah.

652
00:33:22,883 --> 00:33:25,731
Rym: Because Flickr in particular, nothing competes with it.

653
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:29,020
Rym: There's no alternative to Flickr for someone like me.

654
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,241
Scott: Right.

655
00:33:29,261 --> 00:33:30,345
Scott: Now, you might say, "Wait a minute.

656
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:32,634
Scott: There's like a zillion photo sharing sites all over the

657
00:33:32,675 --> 00:33:32,956
Scott: Internet.".

658
00:33:33,016 --> 00:33:33,920
Scott: But that is not true.

659
00:33:34,462 --> 00:33:36,960
Rym: I have like 500 gigabytes of photos.

660
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,928
Scott: Well, Flickr's giving you a terabyte free.

661
00:33:38,989 --> 00:33:40,055
Scott: Oh, wait, that Flickr.

662
00:33:40,075 --> 00:33:40,880
Scott: That's the only good one.

663
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,338
Rym: Yeah.

664
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,508
Scott: And for like a small fee, they'll give you unlimited space.

665
00:33:44,568 --> 00:33:45,029
Scott: Guess what?

666
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,473
Scott: Freaking Picasa.

667
00:33:46,533 --> 00:33:49,180
Scott: They charge you for the space like per gigabyte or whatever.

668
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,840
Rym: Yeah, they give you free uploads only if you upload low resolution shit photos.

669
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,041
Rym: Yeah.

670
00:33:53,121 --> 00:33:58,940
Scott: If you do the math, if you uploaded like all your raw photos to freaking Picasa, cost you a fucking fortune.

671
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,905
Rym: Well, like here's the example of why this is.

672
00:34:00,966 --> 00:34:04,818
Rym: GeekNights is actually hosted on Libsyn, but Libsyn is just a reseller of AWS.

673
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:06,373
Scott: Well, S3.

674
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,112
Rym: S3, which is part of AWS.

675
00:34:09,621 --> 00:34:09,963
Rym: So, yeah.

676
00:34:10,103 --> 00:34:12,438
Rym: Anyway, it's basically what they do as far as we can see.

677
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,739
Scott: I think Libsyn has some of their own servers, too.

678
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,163
Rym: Yeah.

679
00:34:15,243 --> 00:34:21,699
Rym: And they do a lot of stuff where they'll archive things to another server, but there is some Amazon going on in the back end.

680
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:44,820
Rym: So if we were to pay ourselves to use Amazon to host GeekNights for the amount of data we have up and the number of downloads, because not every individual episode is not the end of the world, but the fact that some episode from 2006 gets downloaded like four times, there's a lot of old episodes, it would cost us like a thousand dollars a month.

681
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,399
Scott: So it would cost a fucking ton of money.

682
00:34:46,822 --> 00:34:50,679
Rym: And that's not even if we're doing like raws or higher quality or anything.

683
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,820
Rym: So we're basically paying a lot less for the service, partly because we're a heavy user.

684
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,499
Rym: A lot of other people pay for it, don't use it nearly as much as we do.

685
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,178
Rym: I mean, how many podcasts have listeners?

686
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:05,460
Rym: I mean, even we're in the single digits.

687
00:35:07,782 --> 00:35:09,166
Rym: So it's the same thing with Flickr.

688
00:35:09,226 --> 00:35:13,240
Rym: Most people who pay for Flickr don't have that much on Flickr.

689
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:27,640
Rym: But then there's people like us who have a nice fancy camera, take a lot of pictures and want to store the raw, gigantic images for infinite posterity online somewhere and share those gigantic raw images with people willy nilly.

690
00:35:28,061 --> 00:35:34,860
Rym: Anyway, the new Flickr is pretty great because the way they make all superficial changes right now, but they look great, actually.

691
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,680
Scott: Yeah, it used to be that like you browse Flickr and you get like one photo at a time and most of the screen was white space.

692
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,726
Scott: And, you know, white space is important in web design.

693
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:46,720
Scott: But I think when you've got just a ton of photos, the new Flickr just fills the screen with the photos.

694
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,040
Scott: Well, the old Flickr, which looks great and it looks is really efficient.

695
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,860
Rym: The old Flickr looked great for its time.

696
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,478
Scott: Exactly.

697
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,440
Rym: I mean, back then, all white space everywhere was the way things looked.

698
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:07,060
Scott: The old Flickr basically had the YouTube layout, right, where you have, you know, the main focus is one photo, comments under it, you know, stuff hanging out on the right side and navigation across the top.

699
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,421
Scott: Right.

700
00:36:08,024 --> 00:36:09,851
Scott: And that was sort of in a way invented that.

701
00:36:09,871 --> 00:36:12,280
Scott: I think Flickr is older than YouTube, right?

702
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,239
Rym: Yeah, Flickr.

703
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,320
Scott: Sort of invented that standard layout there.

704
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,688
Rym: You're talking older than YouTube.

705
00:36:16,749 --> 00:36:18,019
Rym: I was using Flickr at RIT.

706
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,374
Rym: YouTube didn't even start going, wasn't available until what?

707
00:36:24,955 --> 00:36:25,577
Rym: It was eight years.

708
00:36:25,597 --> 00:36:27,040
Rym: It was like 2005?

709
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,578
Scott: Something like that.

710
00:36:27,981 --> 00:36:28,779
Rym: I will look up the dates.

711
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,948
Scott: I think YouTube was '07 maybe.

712
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:31,751
Scott: '05, I don't know, '04.

713
00:36:31,892 --> 00:36:32,233
Scott: I don't know.

714
00:36:34,101 --> 00:36:41,360
Rym: I'll look it up, but I am both optimistic and pessimistic about Foundation Day, February 14, 2005.

715
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,699
Scott: So find Flickr's date.

716
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,762
Rym: So think about that.

717
00:36:44,163 --> 00:36:51,540
Rym: YouTube today is the be-all and all source of the majority of the entertainment of the internet generation.

718
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,668
Rym: It did not exist when Scott and I were in high school.

719
00:36:54,949 --> 00:36:58,400
Rym: It did not exist until we were about to graduate from university.

720
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,859
Rym: There wasn't video on the internet the entire time we were at RIT.

721
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:05,200
Scott: It was barely, barely video on the internet.

722
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,970
Rym: Bittorrent was not commonly used.

723
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:07,794
Rym: We would use Hotline.

724
00:37:09,302 --> 00:37:09,553
Rym: Yeah.

725
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,217
Rym: Napster.

726
00:37:11,482 --> 00:37:11,635
Scott: WinMX.

727
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,356
Rym: OpenNAP.

728
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,377
Scott: Direct Connect.

729
00:37:14,423 --> 00:37:14,800
Rym: Oh my God.

730
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,470
Scott: It was the peer-to-peer glory days.

731
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:17,840
Scott: Anyway.

732
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:22,820
Rym: Anyway, but I have a positive point and a negative point, or I guess an optimistic and a pessimistic thing.

733
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,626
Rym: Optimistically, the fact that Yahoo!

734
00:37:25,646 --> 00:37:34,560
Rym: bought Tumblr is not that troubling in light of the fact that they actually are doubling down on Flickr, which is what they said they were going to do way back when this change in management happened.

735
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,217
Rym: I believe the quote was something like, "Instagram should have never even had the chance to

736
00:37:38,278 --> 00:37:38,579
Rym: exist.".

737
00:37:38,901 --> 00:37:45,600
Rym: That should have just been basic functionality, one right click among many, one app among many tied to Flickr.

738
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:45,956
Scott: Yep.

739
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,508
Rym: We missed the boat and we're coming back.

740
00:37:47,749 --> 00:37:49,520
Rym: I'm paraphrasing liberally.

741
00:37:51,341 --> 00:37:54,300
Rym: But they didn't do anything, so that was just all empty promises.

742
00:37:54,942 --> 00:38:02,180
Rym: But now they did the changes to Flickr as a signal right after the Tumblr thing, so maybe they are going to do this.

743
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,294
Scott: Yeah, maybe they're trying to show you like, "Look, we bought Tumblr and here's what we did to Flickr.

744
00:38:06,314 --> 00:38:07,358
Scott: Expect that for

745
00:38:07,398 --> 00:38:07,759
Scott: Tumblr.".

746
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,949
Rym: So here's why I'm pessimistic.

747
00:38:10,652 --> 00:38:12,360
Rym: How the fuck does Tumblr make money?

748
00:38:12,905 --> 00:38:13,277
Scott: I don't know.

749
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,449
Rym: There's no ads.

750
00:38:14,489 --> 00:38:15,300
Rym: The CEO hates ads.

751
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,800
Scott: I thought there was like one ad on the side.

752
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,143
Scott: Where?

753
00:38:17,164 --> 00:38:18,560
Rym: I've never seen an ad.

754
00:38:18,781 --> 00:38:19,080
Scott: Okay.

755
00:38:20,344 --> 00:38:21,997
Rym: And there's a very sort of...

756
00:38:22,461 --> 00:38:24,920
Scott: Maybe people put Project Wonderful on their Tumbles.

757
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:29,980
Rym: There's a very sort of indie anti-advertising sentiment in the Flickr community as well.

758
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:30,627
Scott: Tumblr.

759
00:38:30,647 --> 00:38:31,157
Scott: Uh, Flickr, yeah.

760
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:31,739
Rym: Tumblr, Tumblr.

761
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:32,405
Scott: Well, both.

762
00:38:32,486 --> 00:38:33,399
Scott: And neither side has ads.

763
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:33,821
Rym: Yeah.

764
00:38:34,222 --> 00:38:38,060
Rym: Well, it says that one perk of me paying for Flickr is no ads.

765
00:38:38,465 --> 00:38:38,940
Scott: Oh, really?

766
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:39,186
Rym: Yeah.

767
00:38:39,582 --> 00:38:40,700
Scott: I've never seen ads on Flickr.

768
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,889
Rym: Well, I've been running ad blocks since like 1994, so...

769
00:38:46,563 --> 00:38:47,098
Scott: That's true.

770
00:38:47,461 --> 00:38:52,539
Rym: Back when ad block consisted of a host file for the five known IPs that ads came from...

771
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,239
Scott: Flickr's the right price, so we're good.

772
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:54,760
Rym: Yeah.

773
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:58,760
Rym: Flickr was founded almost exactly a year before YouTube.

774
00:38:58,924 --> 00:38:59,139
Scott: Okay.

775
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:02,559
Rym: So both very old and not that old at all.

776
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:10,800
Rym: But Yahoo, struggling on revenue, struggling to be relevant in the modern era, can't compete with Google in terms of advertising.

777
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:11,250
Rym: Yeah.

778
00:39:11,581 --> 00:39:13,640
Rym: How is Yahoo going to be a successful company?

779
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,539
Rym: Flickr costs way too little, in my opinion, for them to make huge amounts of money off of it.

780
00:39:20,862 --> 00:39:23,237
Rym: I don't know if I'd keep using it if they charged more.

781
00:39:24,502 --> 00:39:28,479
Scott: Well, as long as they're cheaper than everyone else... I'd kind of be forced to use it.

782
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,500
Rym: But if it costs the same...

783
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,560
Scott: If it costs the same, I'll just switch to Picasa.

784
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,181
Rym: Exactly.

785
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:34,653
Rym: If it costs the same as Picasa, I would use Picasa.

786
00:39:34,714 --> 00:39:36,000
Rym: I like Picasa a lot better.

787
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:40,219
Scott: Well, I don't actually like Picasa better, but it's a Google thing, so I can trust it more.

788
00:39:40,404 --> 00:39:40,574
Rym: Yeah.

789
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,480
Rym: But Tumblr, they're going to get all these users.

790
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,640
Rym: How are they going to integrate with and monetize with Tumblr?

791
00:39:48,063 --> 00:39:48,940
Rym: I can't imagine.

792
00:39:49,321 --> 00:39:52,080
Rym: No one using Tumblr wants to use a Yahoo ID to manage it.

793
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:55,100
Rym: The whole point of Tumblr is that it's pretty pseudo-anonymous.

794
00:39:57,133 --> 00:39:57,439
Scott: I don't know.

795
00:39:58,022 --> 00:40:01,640
Scott: A lot of companies these days buy companies without strategies, right?

796
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,080
Scott: And it's like, I wonder, what is your strategy here?

797
00:40:04,882 --> 00:40:11,259
Scott: I see this happen a lot, is companies buy companies because some business people look at the books and they say, aha, this will be a winning move.

798
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:12,800
Scott: Look at these numbers.

799
00:40:12,921 --> 00:40:16,140
Scott: But they don't actually have a strategy of what to do with the company after they bought it.

800
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:22,540
Rym: Tumblr has a huge market in the demographic that people are so desperate to chase and can't.

801
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,439
Scott: So on paper, it looks great, but what are you actually going to fucking do?

802
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:32,359
Rym: And that's what I can't figure out, because if they integrate it too much with Yahoo's existing stuff, no one's going to want anything to do with it.

803
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,520
Scott: Maybe they're going to put all Yahoo stuff into Tumblr, right?

804
00:40:35,843 --> 00:40:36,478
Scott: Go the other way.

805
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,720
Rym: But then how does that make Yahoo money?

806
00:40:39,147 --> 00:40:39,737
Scott: I don't fucking know.

807
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,366
Rym: And maybe Yahoo could go the route of.

808
00:40:42,406 --> 00:41:00,359
Rym: they have high quality services like advanced Tumblr and Flickr, and you get a free version that everyone uses, you get this kind of really big user base, but then you charge your expert users to sort of fund the next step and the professional producers who put their professional stuff in.

809
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,340
Scott: That's actually not a bad strategy.

810
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:07,780
Scott: I mean, it's like, you know, you got this Facebooks and the Googles sort of competing for like this mass, right, whatever.

811
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:15,500
Scott: Flickr could be like, you know, Yahoo could be like, we are the company that owns the web apps that are the highbrow web apps, right?

812
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:22,220
Scott: You know, like the Flickers and now the Tumbles and this, you know, start collecting them and be like, we manage the highbrow web apps.

813
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:29,939
Scott: And it's like, that's actually, you know, if they keep up with that, like the way they've been going with Flickr and they go that strategy, I'd probably end up being using a lot of their shit.

814
00:41:30,301 --> 00:41:30,502
Rym: Yeah.

815
00:41:30,843 --> 00:41:34,340
Rym: Granted, they're the ones who betrayed all those Chinese distance to the Chinese government.

816
00:41:34,687 --> 00:41:34,919
Rym: Yeah.

817
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,460
Rym: Meanwhile, at least Google tries to stand up for that stuff.

818
00:41:37,681 --> 00:41:41,240
Scott: And Yahoo, I think, still makes a lot of money from like Japan, right?

819
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,978
Scott: They have like, Yahoo Auctions there is huge.

820
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:49,880
Rym: And Yahoo Games is super popular among the 40 to 70 year old hearts player demographic.

821
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:52,640
Scott: That hearts and backgammon and shit that's been on YouTube.

822
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:58,000
Scott: Not only is it still the best, it's the exact same one that was on there when I was in high school.

823
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,210
Scott: They haven't updated it for shit.

824
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,300
Scott: It's like this Java applet.

825
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,460
Rym: I used to play hearts on that shit like every day when I was a kid.

826
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,225
Scott: In high school.

827
00:42:04,265 --> 00:42:06,500
Scott: So the late 90s, that's how old that shit is.

828
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,827
Scott: Yahoo Games is ancient.

829
00:42:07,867 --> 00:42:08,771
Scott: They haven't changed it.

830
00:42:08,812 --> 00:42:10,379
Scott: Those apps are still running today.

831
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,500
Scott: And it's, you know, I guess they have ads on it so they make money on it.

832
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:25,080
Rym: You know, it's interesting because, you know, when I realized the reason I don't know a lot about Tumblr, I was trying to think about the monetization stuff we're talking about, is that Tumblr doesn't have documentation and kind of just throws you into the middle.

833
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:25,976
Rym: You just kind of figure it out.

834
00:42:26,422 --> 00:42:26,858
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't.

835
00:42:27,541 --> 00:42:29,614
Scott: Tumblr doesn't have a lot of meta, right?

836
00:42:29,795 --> 00:42:30,540
Scott: Like other things do.

837
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:35,920
Rym: So apparently, according to an interview, David Carp said that Tumblr was monetized by advertising.

838
00:42:35,982 --> 00:42:36,023
Rym: OK.

839
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:38,111
Rym: I've never seen an ad.

840
00:42:38,172 --> 00:42:39,060
Rym: I don't know how the ads exist in Tumblr.

841
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,559
Scott: Maybe you're blocking them just like you are in Flickr?

842
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,141
Scott: Maybe.

843
00:42:41,502 --> 00:42:46,097
Rym: But if I, a technologist, literally didn't know.

844
00:42:46,137 --> 00:42:56,800
Rym: a company advertises because my default ad blocking is so good that I've never seen one, how do they think that that's not going to be every user's experience in the long run?

845
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:57,826
Scott: In the long run.

846
00:42:57,846 --> 00:42:58,390
Scott: But you know what?

847
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,600
Scott: That's the super long run.

848
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,200
Rym: Why doesn't everyone run ad block?

849
00:43:02,501 --> 00:43:05,620
Scott: There's a few people who have like, you know, but most people, I don't fucking know.

850
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,645
Scott: I still don't get that.

851
00:43:08,013 --> 00:43:09,340
Scott: It's not like ad blocks hidden now.

852
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,618
Scott: It's real easy to turn on.

853
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:15,840
Scott: There's a few handful of people that have like, you know, like a stand, like they want ads.

854
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:16,406
Rym: But you know what?

855
00:43:16,467 --> 00:43:17,300
Scott: That's not most people.

856
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:17,688
Scott: Yeah.

857
00:43:18,281 --> 00:43:19,735
Scott: It's just most people I guess are indifferent.

858
00:43:19,755 --> 00:43:20,118
Scott: I don't know.

859
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:26,560
Rym: But apparently also, let's see, the average ad purchase on Tumblr is just under six figures.

860
00:43:26,681 --> 00:43:28,359
Rym: So they're not selling expensive ads.

861
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:28,797
Rym: No.

862
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:29,859
Rym: Under six figures.

863
00:43:29,981 --> 00:43:32,113
Rym: So just under six figures.

864
00:43:32,434 --> 00:43:33,380
Rym: What kind of metric is that?

865
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,429
Rym: So $90,000 is what he's saying.

866
00:43:35,608 --> 00:43:35,734
Scott: Yeah.

867
00:43:36,163 --> 00:43:36,799
Rym: Is the average.

868
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,880
Rym: Functionality lead Tumblr.

869
00:43:39,541 --> 00:43:40,711
Rym: Oh, this.

870
00:43:40,832 --> 00:43:41,276
Rym: Okay.

871
00:43:41,336 --> 00:43:41,639
Rym: Okay.

872
00:43:41,981 --> 00:43:47,660
Rym: During the first half of 2013, Tumblr will allow companies to pay to promote their own posts to larger audiences.

873
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,559
Rym: They're going to monetize the same way Twitter's trying to monetize.

874
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:50,793
Rym: Right.

875
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:57,040
Rym: Those occasional annoying, intrusive, promoted tweets that everyone ignores.

876
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,338
Scott: But in Tumblr, there's a setting where you can say, "Don't put anything in my dashboard that I do not

877
00:44:01,379 --> 00:44:01,700
Scott: follow.".

878
00:44:01,741 --> 00:44:02,137
Scott: And it works.

879
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,739
Scott: So are they going to change that?

880
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,640
Rym: I guess they're going to have to change that.

881
00:44:05,701 --> 00:44:06,689
Scott: That setting goes away.

882
00:44:06,749 --> 00:44:07,758
Scott: You can't get rid of the...

883
00:44:08,721 --> 00:44:13,100
Rym: They say that this functionality will lead Tumblr to profitability in 2013.

884
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:13,880
Rym: So I guess they're not profitable.

885
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,880
Scott: Maybe enough people don't turn the setting off.

886
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:20,320
Rym: Tumblr also generates revenue by selling themes to users to change the appearance of their blog.

887
00:44:20,521 --> 00:44:21,540
Rym: That's not a bad idea.

888
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,285
Scott: That's not the worst.

889
00:44:22,386 --> 00:44:24,020
Scott: Most people can't fucking design for shit.

890
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:25,328
Scott: And I hope that, you know...

891
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:33,580
Rym: If they're going to make hats for other people to then buy in-game, then I have no problem with designers selling...

892
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:39,980
Scott: They should, in fact, make a Tumblr-themed store where users can make Tumblr themes, put them in that store, and sell them to each other.

893
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:43,860
Scott: And Tumblr would take a cut, just like Steam, Valve taking a cut on your hat.

894
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,752
Rym: What amazes me is that Tumblr has received $125 million in funding so far.

895
00:44:48,865 --> 00:44:48,940
Scott: Yep.

896
00:44:51,023 --> 00:44:52,230
Scott: You could have funded 125 $1 million companies.

897
00:44:54,084 --> 00:44:55,900
Scott: I could have funded... And probably would have been better off.

898
00:44:56,161 --> 00:45:03,240
Rym: That could fund 12, like, not triple-A Blockbuster, but 12, like, A-level video games.

899
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,079
Scott: Yeah, one of them's going to be a hit, guys.

900
00:45:05,464 --> 00:45:05,740
Rym: Yeah.

901
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,759
Scott: And it's going to make back a lot more than...

902
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,620
Rym: And those video games, you just sell them and people give you money direct.

903
00:45:12,023 --> 00:45:12,173
Scott: Yeah.

904
00:45:14,627 --> 00:45:15,039
Rym: We'll see.

905
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:18,670
Rym: I'm really ambivalent.

906
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,680
Rym: I can't tell if this is going to be good or bad.

907
00:45:21,181 --> 00:45:29,420
Rym: Either Yahoo's really turning everything around, or Yahoo is really setting itself up to explode, compete with Google, and then collapse.

908
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,707
Scott: All right, so here's another story.

909
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,459
Scott: Let's break away from that.

910
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:40,678
Scott: So, you know, Valve recently, a few months ago, I guess, had this great purge where they fired, like, a whole bunch of people and everyone was like,

911
00:45:40,698 --> 00:45:40,798
Scott: "Whoa!"

912
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,056
Scott: Right?

913
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:42,508
Scott: Yeah.

914
00:45:43,421 --> 00:45:55,320
Scott: Two of those people, former Valve hardware engineer Jerry Ellsworth and programmer Rick Johnson, right, were working on something that was basically some kind of goggles, right?

915
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:57,411
Scott: And it's like Oculus Rift, Google Glass.

916
00:45:57,451 --> 00:45:59,000
Scott: Goggles are pretty hot right now, right?

917
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,659
Scott: And they were working on goggles for Valve.

918
00:46:01,482 --> 00:46:05,980
Scott: And they got fired and they decided to keep working on the goggles, even though they were not at Valve anymore.

919
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:15,020
Scott: And apparently, you know, they went and they talked to the lawyers at Valve, and the Valve lawyers, it was pretty much like, you know, Gabe was like, "Let him have

920
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:15,080
Scott: it.".

921
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,670
Scott: And the lawyers were like, "Okay, it's yours.

922
00:46:17,133 --> 00:46:17,475
Scott: It's yours

923
00:46:17,536 --> 00:46:17,737
Scott: now.".

924
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:18,380
Scott: You know?

925
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:26,680
Rym: See, little things like that is why Valve has some of the only DRM I almost trust to be turned off if they went out of business.

926
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:29,579
Scott: So the prototypes of these goggles look so shitty.

927
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:38,500
Scott: But what they supposedly do is apparently amazing and totally different from what Oculus Rift or what Google Glass does.

928
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:44,399
Scott: What Google Glass does is in the corner of your eye there's a tiny screen that you can look at and do stuff with, right?

929
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:46,026
Scott: Oculus Rift is.

930
00:46:46,227 --> 00:46:48,540
Scott: you are a TV on your face, right?

931
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:56,440
Scott: What this is is that you see something in 3D out in the world in front of you.

932
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,740
Rym: Meaning that's the true augmented reality visual overlay.

933
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,080
Scott: That's what Glass has to become in the long run.

934
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,939
Scott: Yes, these are the deno coil glasses that they're working on.

935
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:15,320
Scott: And, you know, I think that, you know, in the short run, I don't think they'll have a product the way that Oculus Rift and Google Glass will have a product in the short term.

936
00:47:15,861 --> 00:47:23,040
Scott: But I think on the second or third go around, when this shit is ready, if one of those two people doesn't buy them, right?

937
00:47:23,381 --> 00:47:30,800
Scott: They're pretty much going to kick everyone's ass because no one else is as far along in this direction as they are that I know of.

938
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:36,420
Rym: I don't know, though, because I saw a thing about one of Google's patents was basically for their iteration of that.

939
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,080
Rym: And people were saying that that was a prototype for Glass 2.

940
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:48,260
Scott: Quite possibly, but I think these people might be, you know, from what things that the public has seen, they are the farthest along in that direction.

941
00:47:48,942 --> 00:47:49,043
Rym: Yeah.

942
00:47:49,063 --> 00:47:51,280
Rym: I mean, that's what I'm really waiting for.

943
00:47:51,581 --> 00:47:51,902
Scott: Oh, yeah.

944
00:47:52,324 --> 00:47:56,240
Scott: It's like, you know, but I think they're mostly thinking of it in like a gaming direction.

945
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:00,273
Scott: I mean, they're not obviously not strictly a gaming direction, right?

946
00:48:00,374 --> 00:48:01,880
Scott: But they came from Valve, right?

947
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:07,940
Scott: So, you know, walk down the street, you're playing Pac-Man, you see the dots just hovering in the middle of the street while you're walking down, right?

948
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,868
Scott: You see the ghost coming at you, you turn and run away.

949
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:12,960
Scott: That kind of shit is what this is going to do.

950
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:18,620
Scott: So if I could only buy one of the three today, I would definitely get this one.

951
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,800
Rym: Alright, I think we're about done because we gotta get ready for Anime Boston.

952
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:24,720
Scott: Yeah, I gotta eat dinner too and finish the panel.

953
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,318
Rym: I'm mad hungry.

954
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,656
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

955
00:48:33,716 --> 00:48:38,690
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

956
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:44,090
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

957
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:47,037
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

958
00:48:47,177 --> 00:48:51,770
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

960
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:59,640
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

961
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,730
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

962
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:26,877
Rym: It's Monday, April 20th.

963
00:49:27,659 --> 00:49:28,703
Rym: It's Monday, May 20th, 2013.

964
00:49:28,703 --> 00:49:28,843
Rym: I'm Ri-.
