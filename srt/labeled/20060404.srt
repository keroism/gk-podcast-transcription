1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,681
Rym: It's Tuesday April 4th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:15,549
Rym: We bring you our coverage of gaming for hope at Marist College.

3
00:00:17,592 --> 00:00:18,587
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:25,998
Rym: We've pretty much been playing Metroid and Tetris non-stop since we got them But you're not gonna hear about those today.

5
00:00:26,018 --> 00:00:29,030
Rym: No not for a couple weeks at least dumb dumb dumb.

6
00:00:30,112 --> 00:00:33,484
Rym: Now today you're gonna hear about some other things good things though.

7
00:00:33,564 --> 00:00:34,910
Rym: Yeah, well we can start with some news.

8
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:36,909
Rym: I beat Calus.

9
00:00:37,572 --> 00:00:39,049
Rym: Well I beat Scott at Calus.

10
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:41,575
Scott: I Also beat you at Calus.

11
00:00:41,816 --> 00:00:43,161
Rym: I beat him in three rounds.

12
00:00:43,221 --> 00:00:44,125
Rym: I think I set a record.

13
00:00:44,185 --> 00:00:50,902
Scott: That's only cuz I forfeited Because I neglected to look at an important piece of information in the game.

14
00:00:50,982 --> 00:00:53,350
Rym: Yes, the piece of information was Rym is going to win.

15
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:56,670
Scott: Yeah, well the thing is it's like I had this move.

16
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,850
Scott: I could have done this move real easily, and I would have been just fine if I had done this move.

17
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:03,344
Scott: But I said you know what I can do this move next round.

18
00:01:03,384 --> 00:01:04,430
Scott: Why should I do with this round?

19
00:01:05,413 --> 00:01:08,570
Scott: I didn't even look at the board and realize that this was the round.

20
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,747
Scott: I had to do it, and I said oh oops well there that goes.

21
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:15,162
Rym: yep Well at least I can say I have won sixty six point six.

22
00:01:15,222 --> 00:01:17,752
Rym: repeating percent of all games of Calus I've ever played.

23
00:01:17,772 --> 00:01:29,529
Scott: I have one thirty three point three three three percent of all games of gala side just three three three three three three three three three three three three five is right out.

24
00:01:31,311 --> 00:01:36,269
Rym: Also is for unless it's anyway to it then immediately proceed to three.

25
00:01:37,453 --> 00:01:44,269
Rym: Anyway in the actual news I'm sure you're all aware that Michigan among other states had recently tried to pass a law.

26
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:48,544
Rym: in fact They did pass a law restricting the sale of certain mature video games to minors.

27
00:01:49,146 --> 00:01:49,828
Scott: Just what we need?

28
00:01:49,908 --> 00:01:54,804
Scott: more Politicians you know trying to get votes by pandering to the family types.

29
00:01:55,406 --> 00:02:07,570
Rym: Yeah, I mean honestly I'm generally a big fan of Hillary Clinton as controversial of a Politician as that may be but I really dislike the fact that she always seems to jump on this anti-video game bandwagon.

30
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,140
Scott: Yeah, I don't really care.

31
00:02:10,382 --> 00:02:12,410
Scott: You know by their way about Hillary.

32
00:02:12,471 --> 00:02:22,772
Scott: I'm not you know whatever But it really pisses me off when there's all these people who are like otherwise okay, and then they're like video games are evil Lieberman.

33
00:02:23,073 --> 00:02:23,736
Scott: yeah Lieberman is.

34
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:24,760
Scott: he's not a hundred percent.

35
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,784
Scott: Okay, but now he's not.

36
00:02:25,885 --> 00:02:27,250
Scott: he's like 75%.

37
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,114
Rym: Okay, of course.

38
00:02:28,134 --> 00:02:32,310
Rym: There's always a the right honorable Jack Thompson Jack down Jack Thompson.

39
00:02:33,172 --> 00:02:34,599
Scott: Zero percent okay in fact.

40
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:43,348
Rym: He's negative a hundred percent, okay You know I think we've made fun of Jack Thompson in the past 86 episodes of GeekNights more than we've made fun of anyone else.

41
00:02:43,368 --> 00:02:49,570
Rym: well No, this is the first time we've mentioned him in a long time Yeah, but we mentioned him almost every day for like two weeks.

42
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:52,718
Scott: Cuz our podcast started amid Thompson gate.

43
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:56,067
Scott: yeah, in fact it did like Thompson gates one two and three.

44
00:02:56,127 --> 00:03:04,710
Scott: Wow at the sometime We're gonna have to do a retrospective When Jack Thompson dies which I don't imagine will be too too long from now.

45
00:03:05,011 --> 00:03:07,565
Scott: We'll do a look back on the life of Jack Thompson.

46
00:03:07,706 --> 00:03:12,481
Rym: You know thinking back I just think that the word retrospective is probably a little highbrow for what we do.

47
00:03:13,023 --> 00:03:19,110
Scott: We'll give him a lifetime achievement award for Worst person ever most humor provided.

48
00:03:20,071 --> 00:03:22,245
Scott: No, no, there's some other things that are provided.

49
00:03:22,305 --> 00:03:23,150
Scott: slightly more humor.

50
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:31,150
Scott: Yeah like that freaking Dana Carvey show that was on HBO every day for like a Year you were just looking for a way to bring that up cuz we were talking about it.

51
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,210
Rym: Yeah, cuz it's in my head just chopping broccoli.

52
00:03:35,555 --> 00:03:37,849
Scott: You know what I was saying before when you weren't even in the room.

53
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:46,128
Scott: What were you saying make it to make it time make it teeny make it to each time I click it's not To you all right.

54
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:48,254
Rym: That was off topic.

55
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:52,510
Rym: And if you don't know what we were talking about, well, we're gonna talk about that some Thursday.

56
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:56,250
Rym: I think oh, no, I think we could do a whole show on that probably.

57
00:03:57,451 --> 00:04:16,202
Rym: Anyway, so this Michigan law basically, because I mean this law was passed and it restricted the sale of games that were possibly violent or obscene or whatever to minors and a state judge first ruled that there was going to be an injunction against this law being enforced while he ruled on the Trial that I think the ESA had put against the law.

58
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:29,382
Scott: for anyone who doesn't know Injunction means the law doesn't count until the judge says so yeah, it's like if I made a law that said Rym has to stand on his head and Then a judge said wait, I'm gonna put an injunction.

59
00:04:29,442 --> 00:04:32,149
Scott: That means Rym doesn't have to stand on his head yet He had to wait.

60
00:04:32,525 --> 00:04:44,540
Rym: Yeah now injunctions are used usually if the judge thinks that there's going to be some Undo harm that would come about as a result of a situation or a ruling or a law that is in place and he.

61
00:04:44,941 --> 00:04:52,439
Rym: Generally if a judge puts forth an injunction, there's a decent chance He's gonna overturn whatever he put the injunction against in the first place.

62
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:57,016
Rym: That's basically what it is because if he doesn't think he's gonna overturn it he wouldn't bother.

63
00:04:57,036 --> 00:04:57,538
Rym: Mm-hmm.

64
00:04:58,261 --> 00:05:06,922
Rym: but anyway, he put the injunction some months ago and Just now he ruled on the law and it was basically can found flagrantly Unconstitutional.

65
00:05:07,242 --> 00:05:10,411
Scott: so he pretty much spent those months writing and not thinking.

66
00:05:10,712 --> 00:05:13,540
Scott: Yeah, I think he thought right away with that injunction action.

67
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:26,971
Rym: I mean basically it came down to the fact that in addition to the fact that the law was just Right out of the First Amendment and there are all sorts of constitutional problems with it The the lowest test of whether or not a law is constitutional.

68
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,515
Rym: Is that will.

69
00:05:28,575 --> 00:05:30,380
Rym: does the law perform a stated purpose?

70
00:05:31,101 --> 00:05:35,104
Rym: you know, that's like the lowest lowest thing and It's usually trivial.

71
00:05:35,124 --> 00:05:39,020
Rym: I mean if you make a law you can assume that it'll carry out its stated purpose.

72
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:44,387
Scott: I mean like the purpose of the law is to give Rym a headache Rym must stand on his head.

73
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:45,794
Scott: Yeah, there I go.

74
00:05:45,814 --> 00:05:46,799
Rym: I did it.

75
00:05:47,323 --> 00:05:51,649
Rym: Now the law is bad may be bad for other reasons but that's like the lowest bottom rung.

76
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:56,986
Rym: if you can't make that the Supreme Court's just gonna laugh at you and You won't even make it to the Supreme Court.

77
00:05:57,047 --> 00:05:57,890
Rym: now this law.

78
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:06,518
Rym: the purpose of the law was to stop Violence caused by video games among children and they had all sorts of studies to try and back this up.

79
00:06:06,778 --> 00:06:09,391
Scott: the studies They paid for that are to have no science in them.

80
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,862
Rym: Now the judge had this to say Dr.

81
00:06:12,003 --> 00:06:18,100
Rym: Anderson studies have not provided any evidence that the relationship between violent video games and aggressive behavior exists.

82
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:19,513
Scott: You know what that tells me?

83
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,190
Scott: The judge fucking read the study unlike some other people.

84
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,780
Scott: Yeah, I bet you the Congress people don't read the study.

85
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,442
Scott: It gets better.

86
00:06:26,462 --> 00:06:36,900
Rym: the research not only fails to provide concrete evidence that there is a connection between violent media and aggressive behavior It also fails to distinguish between video games and other forms of media.

87
00:06:38,161 --> 00:06:39,608
Rym: Yep, the law was just crazy.

88
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:40,270
Rym: Now.

89
00:06:40,391 --> 00:06:42,500
Rym: Some people have said that why should this be bad?

90
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,894
Rym: I mean there are laws against letting kids see R-rated movies and all that.

91
00:06:45,974 --> 00:06:47,400
Rym: Anyway, no, they're all right.

92
00:06:47,681 --> 00:06:48,826
Rym: That's completely untrue.

93
00:06:49,228 --> 00:06:52,080
Scott: There is no law that says a kid can't see an R-rated movie.

94
00:06:52,181 --> 00:06:58,736
Rym: There are laws against corrupting minors But those laws are fairly difficult to invoke and they vary state to state and county to county

95
00:06:59,017 --> 00:07:02,892
Scott: to corrupt a minor You pretty much have to like prostitute them out on the street

96
00:07:03,193 --> 00:07:05,120
Rym: or show them hardcore snuff pornography

97
00:07:05,434 --> 00:07:06,503
Scott: Yeah Or something like that.

98
00:07:06,764 --> 00:07:13,365
Rym: now as when it comes to movies like R-rated movies or even quote MC 17 or x-rated movies There's no law.

99
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:22,973
Rym: the theaters that don't let kids in or check ID and all that are Really only doing that because they're afraid that the government might pass a law Mm-hmm, but there's absolutely no legal precedent.

100
00:07:23,013 --> 00:07:28,780
Rym: and in fact where I grew up There was one theater that just didn't enforce that at all and they'd show R-rated movies to anyone.

101
00:07:29,568 --> 00:07:33,876
Scott: Yeah I can't tell you how many times like we go to a theater and they didn't ask for ID.

102
00:07:34,017 --> 00:07:37,359
Scott: and now when they ask for ID like your parent comes says let him in and let him in.

103
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,730
Scott: Yeah, and no one cares the theater wants to.

104
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,860
Scott: they want to sell tickets to 17 year old kids.

105
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,844
Scott: They know it's not gonna.

106
00:07:43,025 --> 00:07:46,559
Scott: you know, screw you over, you know MPA does one thing good.

107
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:59,885
Scott: But something else about this law is that most of the comments I saw about it on the internet were Lambasting the state congresspeople for trying to push it and the reason they were doing this is they were saying Look at this.

108
00:08:00,107 --> 00:08:02,100
Scott: This guy knows this law is unconstitutional.

109
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:14,240
Scott: The congressman even said the law was probably unconstitutional and that he was gonna try to get it passed anyway, and that means that he is Spending state tax money on the stupid court system.

110
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:18,640
Scott: He's making a law where he knows everyone is gonna have to spend money to get it thrown out.

111
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:23,343
Rym: That's like when South Carolina recently tried to ban abortion Straight up.

112
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:24,428
Scott: Yeah.

113
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,417
Rym: Yeah, you know Supreme Court Roe vs.

114
00:08:26,457 --> 00:08:27,060
Rym: Wade precedent.

115
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,380
Scott: Yeah, it's like I'm gonna make a law and waste a whole bunch of know what I got it.

116
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,544
Rym: I got a great idea for a law.

117
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:40,138
Rym: Let's pass a law that says that whenever troops from overseas come home They'll be quartered in people's houses.

118
00:08:41,341 --> 00:08:43,110
Scott: Awesome that'd be fantastic.

119
00:08:43,753 --> 00:08:45,180
Scott: I got a better idea, huh?

120
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:51,080
Scott: If there's ever a war in this country like someone invades us Everyone's house becomes a military base.

121
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:51,757
Rym: All right Great.

122
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:57,980
Rym: And while we're at it Let's uh add a clause to the police charter saying that they can always engage in unreasonable search and seizure.

123
00:08:58,461 --> 00:09:01,189
Rym: Dude, I want to see a lot more cruel and unusual punishment out there.

124
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,412
Scott: Wait, here's another one.

125
00:09:02,954 --> 00:09:07,790
Scott: No one can possess ethanol Didn't they try that?

126
00:09:07,952 --> 00:09:08,275
Scott: Yes.

127
00:09:08,335 --> 00:09:11,459
Scott: Yeah It worked just as well.

128
00:09:12,392 --> 00:09:12,640
Rym: All right.

129
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,462
Rym: Here's a quick trivia.

130
00:09:13,783 --> 00:09:26,278
Rym: the first person to post in the forums the name of the federal law that was passed that actually enacted prohibition will win nothing other than me giving you a shout out at some point

131
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:31,060
Scott: and We'll know if you use Wikipedia or the Google or something because that's totally cheating.

132
00:09:31,582 --> 00:09:40,575
Rym: You know what though that's fine because in this case if you don't know you'll have to find out and it yeah Yeah, it doesn't matter if we're ever actually gonna give a real valuable prize.

133
00:09:40,595 --> 00:09:41,800
Rym: It'll be some something you can wick.

134
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,567
Scott: It won't be something you can just look up.

135
00:09:43,628 --> 00:09:45,837
Scott: It'll be something you have to figure out or some shit.

136
00:09:46,198 --> 00:09:47,797
Rym: Yeah All right.

137
00:09:49,061 --> 00:09:54,100
Rym: Now anyway now the ESA they're the ones who actually put forth the lawsuit to get rid of this law.

138
00:09:54,456 --> 00:10:01,831
Scott: Yeah If you don't know the ESA is just like the MPAA and RIA only instead of being about video game Instead of being about movies and music.

139
00:10:02,313 --> 00:10:03,400
Scott: They're about video games.

140
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,280
Rym: Well, the other thing is they actually seem to care about the video game industry and do anything they can to protect it.

141
00:10:08,822 --> 00:10:16,394
Scott: Yeah, but because the video game industry isn't dying in a gutter And it's making a hajillion dollars by selling awesome video games.

142
00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:18,040
Scott: Yeah, you know and you don't see them.

143
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:27,233
Scott: I mean they say bad things about piracy, but you don't see them going around all kinds of hoo-ha Like the MPAA is trying to make all kinds of laws and such.

144
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:27,554
Rym: Yeah.

145
00:10:27,574 --> 00:10:29,180
Rym: Well, they just found technological solutions.

146
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:32,152
Scott: I mean, it's actually oh, yeah great like Star Force.

147
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:33,297
Rym: Well, no, that's terrible.

148
00:10:33,317 --> 00:10:34,120
Rym: But look at consoles.

149
00:10:34,461 --> 00:10:38,440
Rym: It's almost impossible to pirate games of a current generation console.

150
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:43,959
Rym: No, you know like the current one that's around you're not gonna be able to pirate Xbox 360 games for a while.

151
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:48,660
Rym: No, not really, but previous generations get easier and easier to pirate over time.

152
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,460
Rym: But they seem to care less and less about that because that's almost lost revenue.

153
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,751
Scott: Anyway, I think Nintendo's got it really going on.

154
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:56,954
Scott: see what they realized is.

155
00:10:57,396 --> 00:10:58,700
Scott: Okay, firstly is cartridges.

156
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,763
Scott: You can't pirate those.

157
00:11:00,164 --> 00:11:00,545
Scott: All right.

158
00:11:00,606 --> 00:11:02,170
Scott: Now we can't use cartridges anymore.

159
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:05,560
Scott: Okay, people are even pirating GBA games at this point.

160
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:08,020
Scott: Yeah, people are pirating Diaz games at this point.

161
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,849
Rym: Hey, let's compete with the pirates and sell the old games.

162
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:12,334
Rym: Everyone wants for almost nothing.

163
00:11:12,515 --> 00:11:14,000
Scott: I know here's an even better idea.

164
00:11:14,321 --> 00:11:15,305
Scott: Let's make it fine.

165
00:11:15,345 --> 00:11:16,389
Scott: You can pirate the games.

166
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:16,891
Scott: Let's see.

167
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:19,040
Scott: You got a revolution controller to work with your computer.

168
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:21,186
Scott: Yeah, what are you gonna do now?

169
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:21,568
Scott: Huh?

170
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:24,340
Scott: Yeah, or it's like yeah, you can pirate DDR all you want.

171
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,068
Scott: You got to buy a pad from us bitches.

172
00:11:26,088 --> 00:11:27,072
Scott: That's right.

173
00:11:27,494 --> 00:11:28,137
Scott: What do you do, huh?

174
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,824
Scott: Alright, okay.

175
00:11:30,884 --> 00:11:34,714
Scott: So a guy from Microsoft today this Microsoft security guy or whatever.

176
00:11:34,734 --> 00:11:41,860
Scott: He comes out and He says something that everyone's known or at least that I've known for a long time.

177
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:49,073
Rym: Yeah Now it used to not be a hundred percent true in that You used to always be possible to do what he says can't be done.

178
00:11:49,093 --> 00:11:50,960
Rym: It was just usually not worth the effort.

179
00:11:51,324 --> 00:11:51,627
Scott: You know what?

180
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:53,039
Scott: Let's just not say what it is All right.

181
00:11:53,421 --> 00:12:00,600
Rym: Then it now has gotten to the point where it's absolutely in many cases impossible to do what he said can't be done.

182
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:01,573
Rym: So he is now, right?

183
00:12:03,601 --> 00:12:05,133
Scott: Everyone have enough suspense.

184
00:12:05,153 --> 00:12:14,042
Scott: Oh All right, so the guy says if you get malware adware spyware Whatever.

185
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:17,174
Scott: It's becoming really impossible to get rid of it.

186
00:12:17,656 --> 00:12:18,238
Scott: Once you've got it.

187
00:12:18,258 --> 00:12:22,054
Scott: You're done You got to reformat your hard drive and reinstall windows and you know what.

188
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:23,159
Rym: that's pretty much true.

189
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:25,251
Rym: now There's really no way to get rid of a lot of this stuff.

190
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:31,217
Scott: Yeah, I mean back in the day You could get like a little spyware maybe like, you know a toolbar or something.

191
00:12:31,237 --> 00:12:32,040
Scott: That was no good.

192
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:34,051
Scott: Yeah, bonsai, buddy.

193
00:12:34,091 --> 00:12:39,160
Scott: You could have it cursor Yeah, you could use adware or you could use spybot and you could clean it out and you'd be alright.

194
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,118
Rym: Yeah, adware used to be this tiny little thing that ran in like 30 seconds and it only searched for like 20 things.

195
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:45,978
Rym: Yeah, that's all there was.

196
00:12:47,703 --> 00:12:48,510
Scott: Those are good days.

197
00:12:48,994 --> 00:12:49,639
Rym: Ah good days.

198
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:57,000
Scott: Nowadays, if you get spywares or malwares or whatever your computer is pretty much done like.

199
00:12:57,982 --> 00:13:05,720
Scott: You're just gonna have to back up all your data Reformat your hard drive reinstall windows put all your data back make sure your data doesn't have spyware still in it.

200
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:18,689
Rym: And in fact, I remember we were roped into helping an old lady Fix her laptop that wasn't working so well and we found it just a completely infested with I don't know how much Goddamn malware and viruses and just horrible stuff.

201
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,060
Rym: It had even disabled the antivirus stuff that she already had.

202
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,140
Scott: Yeah, the malware had got she probably the Norton probably wasn't updated and probably wasn't scanning.

203
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,129
Scott: So the malware ran and then disabled the Norton.

204
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:33,398
Scott: so the Norton couldn't be used to remove the malware that had snuck in.

205
00:13:34,183 --> 00:13:35,659
Scott: And she's mainly she was using IE.

206
00:13:36,602 --> 00:13:39,490
Scott: So let this be a lesson to everyone.

207
00:13:40,032 --> 00:13:42,940
Scott: It's really easy to prevent getting spyware.

208
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:44,786
Scott: It's really hard to get rid of it.

209
00:13:45,268 --> 00:13:47,014
Scott: So don't get it in the first place.

210
00:13:47,336 --> 00:13:48,600
Scott: now Scott's easy tips.

211
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,026
Scott: I'm not getting it in the first place.

212
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:52,798
Scott: one use Firefox - don't use windows.

213
00:13:52,939 --> 00:13:54,505
Rym: three Don't go to shady websites.

214
00:13:54,987 --> 00:14:05,760
Scott: for before you download a piece of free software Make sure that you know, it's either open source legitimate free software or that it's like not spyware.

215
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,240
Rym: Basically, if you can't find it on SourceForge or it's not something well known like I don't know Skype.

216
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:17,508
Scott: And if it's not unlike download calm you can trust download calm yeah, because they check stuff.

217
00:14:17,548 --> 00:14:23,569
Scott: but like if you're looking on the internet for like I need a Free program that does X Y & Z.

218
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:24,732
Rym: a lot of them seem to be like.

219
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:34,539
Scott: I need a program that'll make icons for windows or I need a program that will edit this weird type of file or Something that will Oh God do something with DVDs.

220
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:34,780
Scott: I

221
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:52,109
Rym: had a flashback to the mid 90s when I don't know how many of you out there were young enough to remember the like Golden Age of wares when pirated software was plentiful and everywhere you just went to where your sites and downloaded it like nice Categorized where sites and you just download like I don't know whatever programs I use.

222
00:14:52,129 --> 00:15:15,296
Rym: back then Macromedia flash like - I don't know all the studios and everywhere's file would come with a dot NFO file and The dot NFO was just a text file that told you you know who cracked the program who pirated it when they did it and Usually some sort of funny quote or something and maybe how to install it how to run the key generator or whatever.

223
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:26,660
Rym: now There were a lot of NFO viewers out there Because people didn't realize at least stupid people didn't realize that dot NFO files were just text files with a different extension.

224
00:15:27,423 --> 00:15:35,049
Rym: so they download these NFO viewers that would show them the contents of the NFO and Fill their computer with horrible Trojan horses and viruses.

225
00:15:35,631 --> 00:15:36,033
Scott: awesome.

226
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:37,840
Rym: That was I remember those days.

227
00:15:38,201 --> 00:15:40,911
Scott: Yeah, it says right here Dan seglio.

228
00:15:40,951 --> 00:15:49,180
Scott: I don't know Dan seglio is that's his last name I guess said the success of social engineering attacks is a sign of the weakest link in malware defense is human stupidity.

229
00:15:49,921 --> 00:15:52,920
Scott: Social engineering is a very very effective technique.

230
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:57,398
Scott: We have statistics that shows significant infection rates for the social engineering.

231
00:15:57,438 --> 00:16:02,616
Scott: malware Fishing is a major problem because there really is no patch for human stupidity now.

232
00:16:02,676 --> 00:16:05,828
Rym: We can solve this pretty handily I mean especially in terms of weak passwords.

233
00:16:05,848 --> 00:16:08,960
Rym: if you have a weak password or you're not you're not sure if your password is strong.

234
00:16:09,562 --> 00:16:14,080
Rym: Just email it to us at GeekNights, and we'll analyze it and let you know if it's a good password or not.

235
00:16:14,462 --> 00:16:15,914
Scott: Hmm very good advice.

236
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,337
Scott: We'll definitely Set up our free.

237
00:16:20,601 --> 00:16:23,870
Scott: I was ready to get some passwords.

238
00:16:24,372 --> 00:16:25,234
Rym: I don't think anyone would.

239
00:16:25,455 --> 00:16:26,858
Rym: I don't think our listeners are that stupid.

240
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:31,114
Scott: frankly Yeah, yeah, anyone who was that stupid listen to the show would rather get pissed off.

241
00:16:31,235 --> 00:16:32,299
Scott: or who knows yeah?

242
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:40,795
Rym: Frankly I wonder how much we've actually pissed anyone off because even the the most Horrible things we've said about some of our listeners in the early episodes.

243
00:16:41,076 --> 00:16:41,860
Rym: You're all still listening.

244
00:16:42,282 --> 00:16:46,440
Scott: I'll tell you what if we piss you off because that's what we're trying to do sometimes.

245
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,183
Rym: Let us know me.

246
00:16:47,364 --> 00:16:49,954
Scott: send an email to GeekNights at front row.

247
00:16:49,994 --> 00:16:50,777
Scott: crew calm.

248
00:16:50,978 --> 00:16:54,759
Rym: Yeah Alright, you're a pimple on society's ass.

249
00:16:55,462 --> 00:16:56,786
Scott: Most most you are.

250
00:16:56,806 --> 00:16:57,669
Scott: I'm not even joking.

251
00:16:58,131 --> 00:17:00,960
Rym: there is no God and your idiotic human ideals are laughable.

252
00:17:03,884 --> 00:17:14,438
Scott: Yeah, but seriously it says here that 250,000 unique machines got this like Fishing like worm that you can only get by doing something stupid.

253
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:21,015
Scott: God Yeah, so to anyone listening Don't be stupid with your computer.

254
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:29,773
Rym: my thing is they will Email from someone who says they're from your credit card company And you got to put in your password to like fix something horribly wrong with your account.

255
00:17:30,254 --> 00:17:32,180
Rym: step back and think wait a minute.

256
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:38,480
Rym: Wouldn't my credit card company call me if there was something bad or wouldn't they send me a letter or something?

257
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,428
Rym: Would my credit card maybe stop working?

258
00:17:41,588 --> 00:17:47,534
Scott: is the next time before you send money to the Nigerian princess Who's gonna help you out and find out if she's a real princess?

259
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:51,670
Scott: Yeah And whether she's in another castle or not.

260
00:17:53,740 --> 00:18:02,134
Scott: I Think we're done So.

261
00:18:02,174 --> 00:18:03,681
Rym: things of the day now.

262
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:10,287
Rym: this apparently I was told Recently is a little bit older than I realized, but this is the first I've seen of it.

263
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:16,910
Rym: so Basically some dude or girl or someone who played World of Warcraft World of Warcraft again.

264
00:18:17,372 --> 00:18:19,382
Rym: Yeah, World of Warcraft as much as we hate.

265
00:18:19,402 --> 00:18:21,130
Rym: It is a great source of amusement.

266
00:18:21,653 --> 00:18:28,787
Scott: it's like this festering cesspool of crap and Occasionally these really funny things come out of the crap.

267
00:18:28,887 --> 00:18:29,370
Scott: It's like poop.

268
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,293
Scott: No poops poop.

269
00:18:30,534 --> 00:18:33,785
Scott: you want to flush poop down the toilet, but poop jokes are hilarious.

270
00:18:33,925 --> 00:18:35,450
Rym: That was a wonderful metaphor.

271
00:18:35,571 --> 00:18:36,114
Scott: It was great.

272
00:18:36,395 --> 00:18:40,870
Rym: Yeah now first of all before I do my thing of the day I got a beef with the World of Warcraft community.

273
00:18:41,492 --> 00:18:56,269
Rym: How come there are a million million million videos on the internet that say there's something awesome about World of Warcraft But they're just this screen with a guy running and a million buttons everywhere and like some death metal playing over it.

274
00:18:57,032 --> 00:18:59,522
Scott: What the hell that's what World of Warcraft is.

275
00:18:59,743 --> 00:19:00,967
Rym: they're like eight minutes long.

276
00:19:01,027 --> 00:19:01,670
Rym: What are you filming?

277
00:19:03,073 --> 00:19:06,490
Scott: That is what World of Warcraft is and what software are using to make these videos?

278
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:09,018
Scott: Is there something in World of Warcraft that does this?

279
00:19:09,078 --> 00:19:12,630
Rym: or using some external program or maybe some horrible malware?

280
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:17,109
Scott: That's what I was about to say when I used to look back in the day for Windows programs that did that.

281
00:19:17,611 --> 00:19:20,161
Scott: They were all either pay money or horrible malware.

282
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,947
Scott: There's one program for Linux that does it.

283
00:19:22,008 --> 00:19:23,535
Scott: It's not malware It's not very good.

284
00:19:23,675 --> 00:19:26,390
Scott: No, so what are you using anyway?

285
00:19:27,193 --> 00:19:32,290
Rym: So this person who played World of Warcraft was in a guild and had a lot of friends died in the real world.

286
00:19:32,878 --> 00:19:33,468
Scott: Oh for real?

287
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,234
Scott: What'd he die of?

288
00:19:35,254 --> 00:19:36,419
Rym: I don't know.

289
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,565
Rym: All right.

290
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:38,450
Rym: It was actually a girl.

291
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,963
Rym: That's why I clarified because I wasn't too sure but someone corrected someone on dig.

292
00:19:43,184 --> 00:19:45,270
Scott: Okay, so a person died for real.

293
00:19:45,511 --> 00:19:55,270
Rym: so and they apparently all their guild mates contacted the family or something and logged into the account and Set up basically a funeral slash wake slash ceremony in game.

294
00:19:55,554 --> 00:19:56,550
Scott: How did they get the password?

295
00:19:57,451 --> 00:19:59,259
Rym: They like I said, they talked to the family or something.

296
00:19:59,279 --> 00:19:59,982
Scott: the family knew it.

297
00:20:00,082 --> 00:20:01,046
Rym: They set something up.

298
00:20:01,328 --> 00:20:14,567
Rym: All right, and they had this huge elaborate funeral and hundreds hundreds of people lined up to pay their respects to the person they were friends with and They had like a priest in the game who did something and speeches and everyone.

299
00:20:14,888 --> 00:20:18,150
Scott: Wow Wait, I gotta say it sucks that someone dies.

300
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:24,950
Scott: But if you're doing like if you're serious about a funeral in an MMO, you got a problem.

301
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:35,629
Rym: Now I honestly I could see this being a somewhat good thing and that I mean if you have friends that you don't Can't meet in the real world and one of them dies I mean, this is probably the only way you can all get together and talk about it.

302
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:36,577
Scott: What are you talking about?

303
00:20:36,617 --> 00:20:38,069
Scott: You're against real funerals?

304
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:42,630
Scott: Now you're gonna argue that you're for World of Warcraft funerals.

305
00:20:43,011 --> 00:20:49,251
Rym: I understand that other people view death a lot differently from the way I view it and I can empathize with how other people treat Death.

306
00:20:49,613 --> 00:20:53,229
Rym: I'll talk about this on another show, but I absolutely don't care at all about death.

307
00:20:54,334 --> 00:20:57,084
Rym: Really don't care when people died it happens.

308
00:20:57,165 --> 00:20:58,510
Rym: I don't worry about it me either.

309
00:20:58,731 --> 00:21:02,270
Rym: But anyway, I understand that other people do and I think this would be a cool thing.

310
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:11,710
Rym: But I'll point out that the world of World of Warcraft That was really kind of awkward to say is a violent horrible dangerous place in game.

311
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:20,324
Rym: If you're gonna have a funeral event like that of that magnitude You should probably have some guards standing by or something.

312
00:21:20,564 --> 00:21:22,550
Scott: Don't they have a church somewhere or something?

313
00:21:22,711 --> 00:21:25,280
Rym: They did it out in the woods in this nice serene lake or something.

314
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:26,124
Scott: Yeah, great.

315
00:21:26,465 --> 00:21:38,489
Rym: So they're doing this and basically a bunch of guys in an opposing guild got together an army you mean the heroes and This army marched out to where this funeral was hit over a hill.

316
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:43,366
Rym: One guy like walks out and walks over to like the the priest or whoever.

317
00:21:43,426 --> 00:21:56,903
Rym: the focal point of all this is It's a Google video so I couldn't really see Attacks him and apparently that was the signal because then the army comes over the ridge and they kill Absolutely everyone at the funeral screaming poon poon poon the whole time.

318
00:21:56,923 --> 00:22:02,950
Scott: I Seen it and I knew what this was before we did the podcast.

319
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,211
Scott: It's so funny now.

320
00:22:04,231 --> 00:22:11,088
Rym: the video is great because it starts with actual quotes from various forums of people who were attacked by this.

321
00:22:11,489 --> 00:22:13,969
Rym: after the Fact and the quotes I'm not even gonna read them on the air.

322
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:18,050
Rym: They're just they're priceless people like I hope your dad dies of a heart attack.

323
00:22:18,451 --> 00:22:27,989
Rym: And then when you're at the funeral a naked guy runs in pushes over the coffin and runs around yelling poon Dude, if someone did that in real life, they would be my hero also.

324
00:22:29,671 --> 00:22:31,376
Rym: But they kill everyone in.

325
00:22:31,396 --> 00:22:35,790
Rym: the video shows like the stately funeral and everyone lining up to pay their respects.

326
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:42,110
Rym: Then it cuts to this army running through the woods and it keeps cutting back and forth and then it shows the chaos.

327
00:22:42,975 --> 00:22:45,110
Rym: Awesome It was fantastic.

328
00:22:46,711 --> 00:22:49,820
Scott: We should recreate that in real life.

329
00:22:50,663 --> 00:22:51,004
Rym: Huh?

330
00:22:51,044 --> 00:22:53,371
Rym: You know, that could be a project for a mega 64.

331
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,178
Scott: They could be oh my god.

332
00:22:55,218 --> 00:22:57,085
Scott: What would make a 64 do with World of Warcraft?

333
00:22:57,145 --> 00:22:57,687
Scott: Oh my god.

334
00:22:57,747 --> 00:23:00,782
Rym: Oh my god All right, so then you have some thing of the day.

335
00:23:00,803 --> 00:23:02,070
Scott: Yeah, it's not that exciting.

336
00:23:02,231 --> 00:23:04,581
Scott: It's it's a simple little web page with some text on it.

337
00:23:04,601 --> 00:23:05,766
Rym: It's not even game related.

338
00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:06,570
Rym: I don't know what you're thinking.

339
00:23:06,871 --> 00:23:07,172
Scott: I don't know.

340
00:23:07,192 --> 00:23:10,283
Scott: I couldn't find any game related ones that I thought were worthy.

341
00:23:10,303 --> 00:23:27,730
Scott: So whatever it says here on the top of the page computers and the Internet according to normal users and then they're a sequence of sentences that are humorous such as Things that these are these are basically things that normal users think such as there's no such thing as a word processor or spreadsheet.

342
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:29,819
Scott: There is Word and Excel respectively.

343
00:23:29,979 --> 00:23:32,369
Scott: It's inconceivable that there would never be a computer without them.

344
00:23:33,415 --> 00:23:34,240
Rym: I like the one that was.

345
00:23:34,522 --> 00:23:35,950
Rym: the Internet is Internet Explorer.

346
00:23:36,831 --> 00:23:39,160
Scott: Internet Explorer is more commonly known as the Internet.

347
00:23:39,562 --> 00:23:41,570
Scott: when you say open the Internet you mean opening IE.

348
00:23:41,871 --> 00:23:44,949
Scott: You have no idea what a browser is or there are alternatives to IE.

349
00:23:45,392 --> 00:23:46,276
Rym: I have one thing to say.

350
00:23:46,497 --> 00:23:54,930
Rym: if you read this website and you think these are at all far-fetched You have no idea how absolutely ignorant the vast majority of people are when it comes to computers.

351
00:23:55,211 --> 00:24:02,564
Scott: And if you are this ignorant like any one of these if any one of these describes you I'm inviting you over to my house.

352
00:24:04,592 --> 00:24:08,203
Rym: If you invite just because you if you invite him over you're not allowed to kill him.

353
00:24:08,825 --> 00:24:14,329
Rym: get out of here Flanders okie-dokie I Wow we're just fully inside jokes today.

354
00:24:14,711 --> 00:24:16,358
Scott: I don't think that one was too inside.

355
00:24:16,418 --> 00:24:17,342
Scott: anyone who's seen that.

356
00:24:17,362 --> 00:24:21,179
Rym: that's like a huge Simpsons episode it is But you realize how long ago that was.

357
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:23,169
Scott: it's the one where Wiggum loses a job or something?

358
00:24:23,189 --> 00:24:25,599
Scott: no It's the one where it's not to do with Wiggum.

359
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:30,470
Rym: no Wiggum's in the room because he's talking to Homer about what to do if an intruder comes back.

360
00:24:30,691 --> 00:24:36,106
Rym: It's the one where shot sideshow Bob is coming back to kill Bob.

361
00:24:36,627 --> 00:24:37,530
Scott: sideshow Bob number two.

362
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:38,113
Rym: I think.

363
00:24:38,153 --> 00:24:44,607
Scott: so yeah cuz Wiggum is like you know if a man comes in your house uninvited You can do whatever you want to him, and he's like Homer's like come over here Flanders.

364
00:24:44,747 --> 00:24:49,620
Scott: He's like hi Lee ho and then Wiggum says it doesn't work if you invite him.

365
00:24:49,761 --> 00:24:52,413
Scott: Yeah, and he's like get out of here Flanders Ugly-dugly.

366
00:24:52,614 --> 00:24:53,277
Rym: Thank You Ted.

367
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:54,060
Rym: that was the joke.

368
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,830
Scott: yes, that was the joke we described one inside joke.

369
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,778
Scott: We're not giving you the rest.

370
00:24:57,818 --> 00:24:58,504
Scott: no more freebies.

371
00:24:58,604 --> 00:25:05,434
Scott: Haha If you receive an email from a long-lost relative in Nigeria, it's probably legit.

372
00:25:05,695 --> 00:25:07,259
Scott: after all he's got the same last name as you.

373
00:25:09,025 --> 00:25:13,930
Rym: Actually one Fairly well thought out phishing scam I've seen lately.

374
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,114
Rym: that seems to affect these people.

375
00:25:15,154 --> 00:25:17,693
Rym: since you're thinking the day and your news seem to Really fit together.

376
00:25:17,734 --> 00:25:21,620
Rym: well They'll put something about your credit card blah blah blah.

377
00:25:22,081 --> 00:25:28,799
Rym: And then they'll show like the last four digits of your credit card number and people think oh that must be legit They know my credit card number.

378
00:25:29,663 --> 00:25:36,589
Rym: I just want to tell all of you out there that there's a finite number of last four digits in credit cards And they're not very unique in fact.

379
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:40,524
Rym: They're identical across many types of cards Indeed.

380
00:25:41,186 --> 00:25:47,005
Scott: so they all they do is pick four digits send them out to everyone and they'll get like a 25% hit rate in fact.

381
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:51,678
Rym: It's a lot like the scam that the bad guy in the in math net.

382
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:51,899
Scott: yep.

383
00:25:53,522 --> 00:25:54,786
Rym: I hope you've all seen that movie.

384
00:25:54,826 --> 00:25:57,155
Rym: if not I feel really really really old.

385
00:25:57,335 --> 00:26:01,694
Scott: you know we have an Episode that you could go back in the archives and listen to.

386
00:26:01,715 --> 00:26:02,840
Scott: it was a Thursday.

387
00:26:03,901 --> 00:26:05,648
Scott: That will inform you someone.

388
00:26:05,668 --> 00:26:08,600
Rym: I'm gonna see if that movies in frickin Netflix go for it.

389
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,526
Scott: Oh, yeah, check the IMDb first.

390
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:18,434
Rym: well to move on to our main bit as we mentioned yesterday over the weekend We went up to Marist College where they had their annual gaming for hope.

391
00:26:19,137 --> 00:26:21,028
Scott: now the first thing Let's start at the beginning.

392
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:21,914
Rym: all right now game.

393
00:26:21,954 --> 00:26:22,135
Rym: It won't.

394
00:26:22,155 --> 00:26:22,860
Rym: we can explain what game.

395
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,362
Rym: No, let's start.

396
00:26:23,403 --> 00:26:30,140
Scott: even more earlier than that I find out about gaming for hope on the internet He sends me a message with the link to it, which I promptly ignore.

397
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:35,338
Rym: I said it again I click on it And then I never actually look at the page because it opened in another tab.

398
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,579
Rym: And then I went home from work.

399
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:40,340
Rym: I say something about it to you, and I say what are you talking about?

400
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,726
Scott: Yeah, all right once we got past that part we and it was not such good weather We decided to go.

401
00:26:45,786 --> 00:26:46,592
Scott: we had nothing better to do.

402
00:26:46,612 --> 00:26:53,560
Rym: yep on the way We bought Metroid Prime hunters and Tetris DS, which we'll talk about in a future episode.

403
00:26:53,620 --> 00:27:00,669
Rym: Yeah, I can say however that purchasing those two items was key key key key to our enjoyment of gaming for hope Absolutely key.

404
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:05,852
Rym: now first off I'd like to say Marist College is a really pretty campus.

405
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:09,424
Rym: that is probably the most poorly designed campus I've ever set foot on.

406
00:27:09,565 --> 00:27:11,474
Scott: the roads are just horrible.

407
00:27:11,574 --> 00:27:12,800
Scott: there were two different entrances.

408
00:27:13,286 --> 00:27:17,411
Scott: I went in one entrance And I couldn't get to the other entrance from the one I went in.

409
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:27,949
Rym: plus we drive in and every parking lot has a sign That says if you don't have a parking permit you will be towed and there's a sign that says go to the X building Security desk to get a whatever.

410
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:30,760
Rym: There's no sign saying where that building is not one at all.

411
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:36,940
Scott: There's just no way to get around this campus if you haven't been there granted the campus isn't so large So you're you're okay in that department.

412
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:41,118
Rym: Basically just drove up and down every road until we found the sign that pointed toward gaming for hope.

413
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,879
Scott: yeah But we found it was all good.

414
00:27:43,253 --> 00:27:51,320
Rym: Yeah now it was in the gym and We were a little worried because there was also a lot of sports going on at the same time And it was hard to tell walking in is alright.

415
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,615
Rym: Is this gonna be a good event or is this just gonna be some podunk crap thing?

416
00:27:54,655 --> 00:27:55,840
Rym: and these people are all here for sport?

417
00:27:57,041 --> 00:27:58,365
Scott: There's actually pretty sizable.

418
00:27:58,526 --> 00:28:03,769
Rym: Yeah, well the first thing we see is a giant beautiful Dell flat-screen display that was up for auction.

419
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,847
Rym: well up for a Contest a raffle a raffle.

420
00:28:07,168 --> 00:28:07,329
Scott: yep.

421
00:28:07,409 --> 00:28:09,055
Scott: They actually had two of them for raffle.

422
00:28:09,376 --> 00:28:10,340
Rym: Yeah, I bought some tickets.

423
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:10,962
Rym: I didn't win.

424
00:28:11,283 --> 00:28:11,624
Scott: damn it.

425
00:28:12,086 --> 00:28:15,899
Rym: some guy put like 70 bucks in because he figured the odds were he'd get it.

426
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,265
Scott: The odds were he'd get it.

427
00:28:17,285 --> 00:28:18,350
Scott: there weren't so many people there.

428
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:19,415
Rym: I don't know if he actually got it.

429
00:28:19,737 --> 00:28:20,320
Scott: I don't know either.

430
00:28:21,061 --> 00:28:22,808
Scott: Anyway, this is your typical gaming event.

431
00:28:22,949 --> 00:28:25,800
Scott: I mean on one side the head look command center tables.

432
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,266
Scott: They were selling soda and whatnot.

433
00:28:27,647 --> 00:28:34,074
Scott: they had many many rows of tables set up for land partying But only about two of the rows worth had computers.

434
00:28:34,134 --> 00:28:35,360
Scott: the other a lot of them were empty.

435
00:28:35,501 --> 00:28:37,559
Rym: So yeah, I have a lot to say about that later.

436
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:44,840
Scott: Yeah, then around the edges of the main area of the room They had tables with TVs and consoles set up with all kinds of games.

437
00:28:45,021 --> 00:28:58,840
Rym: I mean they had consoles ranging from like the newest newest consoles coming out now to old Nintendo's and at one point they announced over the loudspeaker system that they needed someone with an old-ass TV Because they had pong and they were gonna hook it up.

438
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,720
Scott: They had a pong Pro-am not a pong super Pro-am, but a pong Pro-am that they were ready to hook up.

439
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,549
Scott: I saw the guy holding it, but they didn't.

440
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,679
Scott: I don't know if they got an old TV to actually play it.

441
00:29:08,202 --> 00:29:09,670
Rym: Yeah, they also had a bunch of game tournaments.

442
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,957
Rym: I don't know if there were prizes or not.

443
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:12,940
Scott: yeah I don't know what the prizes were either.

444
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:18,519
Scott: It seemed like they had a bunch of little doohickeys in behind the command center like little Death Star toys and whatnot.

445
00:29:19,342 --> 00:29:20,906
Scott: Nothing particularly interesting now.

446
00:29:20,946 --> 00:29:24,858
Rym: We basically only went knowing because we have that club we run with maws.

447
00:29:24,918 --> 00:29:25,660
Rym: these are gamers.

448
00:29:25,901 --> 00:29:31,880
Rym: we actually run the website on the same hosting that we run GeekNights and We figured we were gonna meet them there to play the new game.

449
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,709
Scott: We got Calus, but you'll talk about in another episode.

450
00:29:34,729 --> 00:29:38,080
Rym: yep, so we figured no matter how bad this event might be we're covered.

451
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,405
Rym: We'll play a game at Calus and go home.

452
00:29:39,565 --> 00:29:39,766
Scott: Yep.

453
00:29:39,846 --> 00:29:41,933
Scott: It was from 1 p.m.. To 1 a.m..

454
00:29:42,395 --> 00:29:42,555
Rym: Now.

455
00:29:42,596 --> 00:29:46,283
Rym: We get there and - yeah - ish cuz.

456
00:29:46,323 --> 00:29:51,100
Scott: we had to stop and eat and then stop and buy the video games and the MOS guys are there.

457
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:51,984
Rym: They're playing some other game.

458
00:29:52,004 --> 00:29:55,199
Rym: They'll probably finish up within an hour, so we decided to sit down and play some DS.

459
00:29:56,521 --> 00:30:08,198
Rym: Not two seconds after we open our DS's a bunch of guys walk over and say hey you guys have DS's Cool guys, and we immediately proceeded to play Metroid Prime hunters with cool guy, and then all sorts of other games.

460
00:30:08,499 --> 00:30:16,994
Rym: yep And I got to say over the course of this night one I saw 2p2 PSP's at all and I saw at least 20 DS's.

461
00:30:17,114 --> 00:30:18,458
Scott: at least three or four times.

462
00:30:18,498 --> 00:30:23,057
Scott: there were large Gatherings of like four to eight people in the middle of the room sitting in a circle of DS's.

463
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:31,100
Rym: like at one point They announced people are trying to get a full game of Mario Kart in this up the games full nevermind Yep, that's how it goes now.

464
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:39,117
Rym: I was very pleased that I walked over to this circle of people playing Mario Kart at one point And I asked them if anyone was any good and they gave me this look like are you trying to start something?

465
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:39,960
Rym: and then?

466
00:30:40,622 --> 00:30:46,180
Rym: Over the course of the night I raced many various people and I kicked all of their asses into the ground handily.

467
00:30:47,082 --> 00:30:48,186
Rym: I was very pleased.

468
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:52,498
Scott: apparently I did the same thing with Tetris even though I had just bought it.

469
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:55,453
Scott: apparently I'm better at Tetris than most people is.

470
00:30:55,473 --> 00:30:56,680
Rym: I mean he kicks my ass.

471
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:00,737
Scott: I played online though and then some people I come across kicked my ass, so it's all good.

472
00:31:00,938 --> 00:31:01,098
Rym: Yep

473
00:31:02,025 --> 00:31:04,746
Scott: I'm not the god of Tetris I'm just better than most

474
00:31:05,088 --> 00:31:14,619
Rym: but Metroid Prime hunters is one hell of a game Especially when you're playing with a bunch of people who haven't played it before either And you're all of the same skill, and you're sitting five feet from the person so you can punch them.

475
00:31:15,262 --> 00:31:24,320
Scott: Yeah, we'll talk more about the game later, but the only thing I can say negative about it Is that it's very controllable, but if you play too long your hand will hurt.

476
00:31:24,621 --> 00:31:26,971
Rym: Yeah, my left thumb is actually a little sore right now.

477
00:31:27,312 --> 00:31:29,180
Scott: It's mostly in the lower palm.

478
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:31,907
Rym: We'll see you play with the stick.

479
00:31:31,968 --> 00:31:33,033
Rym: I play with the thumb nub.

480
00:31:33,655 --> 00:31:41,136
Rym: I don't play with the thumb nub But yeah, we played much DS throughout the night and Everyone had DS.

481
00:31:41,177 --> 00:31:42,606
Rym: I mean there's an old guy who had a DS.

482
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:47,829
Rym: all these awesome College punk gamer kids who are a lot like we were when we were in college.

483
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:53,100
Rym: They were also penny arcade fans Which we could tell from the highbrow penny arcade shirt.

484
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,843
Rym: one of them was wearing.

485
00:31:54,043 --> 00:31:55,167
Scott: well gaming for hope.

486
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:56,472
Scott: let's go back The.

487
00:31:56,612 --> 00:32:00,543
Scott: the gaming club at Marist I think was called 4g something.

488
00:32:00,763 --> 00:32:01,826
Rym: yeah for 4gh.

489
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:03,290
Rym: They also apparently have an anime club.

490
00:32:03,532 --> 00:32:07,736
Scott: Yeah, anyway, they They were putting on this event.

491
00:32:07,836 --> 00:32:09,061
Scott: apparently they do it annually.

492
00:32:09,081 --> 00:32:16,350
Scott: you can go to gaming for hope calm and read all about it Where it's basically free LAN party free consoles free tournaments free pizza.

493
00:32:16,831 --> 00:32:21,805
Scott: Yeah, they fed us twice like free pizza showed up around like four.

494
00:32:21,945 --> 00:32:22,467
Rym: ish now.

495
00:32:22,527 --> 00:32:23,670
Rym: You should have seen this.

496
00:32:23,832 --> 00:32:25,269
Rym: I wish we'd had a video camera.

497
00:32:25,691 --> 00:32:33,070
Rym: Imagine there's like maybe a total of about 90 100 people all in various corners or like outside the door playing games talking whatever.

498
00:32:33,872 --> 00:32:45,438
Rym: Suddenly someone yells pizza and You blink and then your eyes open again, and everyone's gone, and you turn and there's a sea of geeks like violently scrounging pizza out of boxes.

499
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:48,807
Rym: like a box would open it would disappear and then another box would open.

500
00:32:48,828 --> 00:32:50,675
Scott: and what was great is Everyone was sated.

501
00:32:50,795 --> 00:32:53,388
Scott: it was there was no one standing around like I didn't get any.

502
00:32:53,589 --> 00:33:03,644
Rym: yeah They had pretty much exactly the right amount of pizza and then to our surprise later in the night pizza showed up again Right when we were thinking hey, we should go get some food before we die.

503
00:33:03,764 --> 00:33:04,829
Scott: yeah, it was like.

504
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:06,517
Scott: How cool is that?

505
00:33:06,638 --> 00:33:09,010
Scott: not only they give it away for free they give it away for free twice.

506
00:33:09,271 --> 00:33:10,515
Scott: The best part was when it came.

507
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:19,710
Scott: the second time I went over to get some a box was opened in front of me And two seconds later the box is empty, and I had to open another box.

508
00:33:20,251 --> 00:33:24,743
Scott: I took out two slices, and then the box is empty and the next guy opened another box.

509
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,007
Rym: I freaking love gamers.

510
00:33:26,428 --> 00:33:32,110
Rym: Oh my god Now they had some kind of deal going with balls which apparently is an energy drink.

511
00:33:32,431 --> 00:33:49,430
Scott: They had to seem to have deals going on with a lot of people who it didn't seem like they had big sponsorships like the mega land parties do but they had like you know Like sponsorship packets that must have come from corporations And they had a bunch of free stickers and goodies and all kinds of shit.

512
00:33:49,651 --> 00:33:53,070
Rym: Yep, there was one guy who was trying to cover himself entirely in stickers.

513
00:33:53,471 --> 00:33:58,690
Scott: Well those are the stickers for the gaming club, but yeah, so oh yeah back to what gaming for hope is is they?

514
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:09,270
Scott: They don't collect money because it's free to get in but all the raffle tickets and all the other money They collect they give the child's play and they have one of those giant checks and all that good stuff.

515
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:14,223
Rym: And they said they were selling stuff like t-shirts And they were just taking donations, and they were selling soda.

516
00:34:14,243 --> 00:34:18,257
Rym: ended up buying some balls Which I'm sure the money went to the charity though.

517
00:34:18,338 --> 00:34:21,630
Rym: I bought it only because they didn't have change for the bills I had.

518
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,695
Rym: Gamers must be poor.

519
00:34:23,755 --> 00:34:26,389
Rym: I mean I had a friggin $10 bill, and they couldn't make change.

520
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:32,166
Rym: Wow, so I just bought enough pop and balls until they didn't have to give me change.

521
00:34:32,627 --> 00:34:33,751
Scott: Oh, it's gamers It's.

522
00:34:33,931 --> 00:34:35,918
Scott: it's not the fact that the gamers and where it's college.

523
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,284
Scott: No money in college.

524
00:34:37,304 --> 00:34:38,690
Rym: They're gamers, and they're in college.

525
00:34:38,891 --> 00:34:39,844
Rym: That's like a double whammy.

526
00:34:40,007 --> 00:34:45,268
Scott: yeah It was really weird because it's like we're people with loads and loads of money sitting in the middle of a room.

527
00:34:45,991 --> 00:34:49,030
Rym: People with no money yeah, but we used to be those people with no money.

528
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,208
Rym: We did and you know what those were good days.

529
00:34:51,571 --> 00:34:54,850
Scott: It's actually surprising a lot of people that we met there were not from Marist.

530
00:34:55,346 --> 00:35:01,456
Rym: Yeah Like every time we thought all right like we met with this one group the guys who played DS with and we kept running a Foul of them all night.

531
00:35:01,898 --> 00:35:02,682
Rym: They were awesome.

532
00:35:02,702 --> 00:35:06,378
Rym: They were just like we were in college and We were thinking you know all right.

533
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:10,317
Rym: There's some geeks around here now They all live from other freaking all over the place.

534
00:35:10,378 --> 00:35:11,281
Rym: one guy was from Jersey.

535
00:35:11,301 --> 00:35:13,388
Scott: Yeah, that's a matter.

536
00:35:13,409 --> 00:35:14,760
Scott: They were cool anyway didn't matter.

537
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:18,962
Scott: yeah, and The Moz guys you ended up playing a lot of cool games with them.

538
00:35:19,023 --> 00:35:20,610
Rym: Yeah, Kayla's is fantastic.

539
00:35:20,791 --> 00:35:22,460
Rym: Yeah, we'll do a whole show about that.

540
00:35:22,742 --> 00:35:26,542
Scott: Yeah, we're going to play it some more though I'm sure we'll play it some more before we do an episode on it.

541
00:35:26,622 --> 00:35:28,050
Rym: Yep, and also everyone was cool.

542
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:36,390
Rym: I mean we had a bunch of little kid like not little kids But young punk kids and other people just walking up over playing because they'd obviously never seen German board games before.

543
00:35:36,854 --> 00:35:47,270
Rym: So we were kind of like hey stick around We'll play a game with you after we finish this and we got all these people who really hadn't played games before to play Games with us, and I think we got a few people a little bit hooked on the German style games.

544
00:35:47,632 --> 00:35:49,810
Scott: Yeah, and Moz finally listen to my suggestions.

545
00:35:49,931 --> 00:35:52,363
Scott: They had some flyers and stuff and they talked to people.

546
00:35:52,423 --> 00:35:53,770
Scott: so I some people took the flyer.

547
00:35:53,911 --> 00:35:55,901
Scott: So they'll probably come to Moz at some point.

548
00:35:55,941 --> 00:35:57,610
Scott: Maybe yeah, that'd be cool.

549
00:35:57,911 --> 00:36:00,503
Scott: Get some more people there instead of just old scary old guys.

550
00:36:00,523 --> 00:36:02,110
Rym: What was the name of that really quick game?

551
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:06,865
Rym: We played the the chicken game where you put the cards around and you put tokens on them.

552
00:36:07,227 --> 00:36:08,230
Rym: I forget whatever.

553
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:09,295
Rym: It was a fun game.

554
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:10,440
Rym: We played with this little punk kid.

555
00:36:10,641 --> 00:36:10,841
Scott: Yep.

556
00:36:11,424 --> 00:36:14,328
Scott: That is if I played it once before I think I told you about it, too.

557
00:36:15,052 --> 00:36:15,373
Scott: It's it's.

558
00:36:15,553 --> 00:36:20,950
Scott: it's a nice little easy card game, you know, and it really sucks because you remove those nine cards from the deck.

559
00:36:21,201 --> 00:36:28,314
Rym: Yeah now I guess the best testament we can give to how well done this event was is that one we have a really high standard for Events in general.

560
00:36:28,495 --> 00:36:31,150
Rym: Yeah, we'll walk out of an event at the drop of a hat

561
00:36:31,471 --> 00:36:36,546
Scott: like we can tell when something is poorly organized and it really like grinds the gears

562
00:36:36,647 --> 00:36:45,390
Rym: mostly because at RIT I mean RIT has a massive gaming club and a massive massive anime club And we kind of ran and helped run the anime club for a long time.

563
00:36:45,813 --> 00:36:52,528
Rym: So we saw like the big events where you know hundreds of people would show up and all the planning and coordination and we saw events that went without a hitch.

564
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:58,510
Rym: often and Whenever a club did something poorly We just we couldn't stand it and it would bother us because how could they do something so shittily?

565
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,829
Scott: What's worse is when a convention does something for us?

566
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:07,569
Scott: That's like we did it only once people are paying for it and you fucked it up aka the New York Comic Con.

567
00:37:08,512 --> 00:37:17,106
Rym: New York Comic Con Ohio Con was Ohio Con - Ohio Con - Yeah, yeah, every other kind I've gone to as well went off pretty well.

568
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,426
Scott: Yeah, I haven't really been to anything else that messed up.

569
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,988
Rym: But these guys put up pulled off a fairly high-class event.

570
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,780
Rym: There were no incidents other than one guy opened a door.

571
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,849
Rym: He shouldn't have opened and set off an alarm at one point.

572
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,623
Scott: Yeah, but we didn't have to evacuate or anything.

573
00:37:28,643 --> 00:37:28,986
Scott: It was cool.

574
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:34,728
Rym: Yeah, I mean the only things that went wrong at all was the one tournament we wanted to enter the doubles Mario Tennis tournament.

575
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,562
Rym: No one ran it and it was canceled.

576
00:37:37,168 --> 00:37:42,550
Rym: Oh And there was this one dude playing DDR who smelled like the inside of a horse's asshole.

577
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:48,470
Scott: I couldn't tell which dude it was but we were sitting playing DS in closer proximity to the does real smart of them.

578
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:54,030
Rym: They hit the DDR on the far side of the room DDR in the one corner guitar heroes way off in the other corner.

579
00:37:54,251 --> 00:38:05,010
Scott: Yeah, there were four to empty tables meant for extra land people between Everyone and the DDR and the DDR pretty much had constant use by at least two people at a time.

580
00:38:05,311 --> 00:38:08,785
Rym: So we were sitting about I don't know 20 feet away from the DDR just playing DS game

581
00:38:08,826 --> 00:38:10,151
Scott: and all of a sudden I can't Breathe

582
00:38:10,492 --> 00:38:17,579
Rym: like we all look at each other and the one older guy we were playing with says something to the effect of Did someone step in something or did a pipe break?

583
00:38:18,281 --> 00:38:20,809
Rym: and we recognize the smell because we played a lot of DDR.

584
00:38:21,613 --> 00:38:23,222
Rym: That's the smell of unwashed fanboy.

585
00:38:23,383 --> 00:38:24,569
Scott: That is indeed the smell.

586
00:38:25,032 --> 00:38:33,590
Rym: I mean we and we couldn't get away from it and we like ran to the other side of the room And we're trying to figure out because there were two guys playing DDR which one of them was the smell.

587
00:38:33,953 --> 00:38:35,510
Scott: Well, I think it was a guy and a girl playing.

588
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,472
Rym: well There were two guys.

589
00:38:36,513 --> 00:38:38,901
Rym: the guy left and a girl came over and she was playing.

590
00:38:38,921 --> 00:38:42,614
Rym: and then we noticed that halfway through she pulled Off like the scarf thing.

591
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:44,441
Rym: She was wearing and held it across her face.

592
00:38:44,843 --> 00:38:46,670
Rym: Yeah, and she booked when the song ended.

593
00:38:47,212 --> 00:38:48,699
Rym: So we're pretty sure it was that one guy.

594
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:50,950
Scott: Yeah, but then he came over to our side of the room.

595
00:38:50,991 --> 00:39:00,505
Rym: It didn't bring his odor with him yeah, so I guess either someone was dead and rotting behind the DDR screen or Maybe the guy's smell is all held in by his clothes.

596
00:39:00,525 --> 00:39:03,258
Scott: now that it wasn't moving I have no idea what it was.

597
00:39:03,298 --> 00:39:06,010
Scott: All I can say is there's a rancid smell and DDR was the source.

598
00:39:07,991 --> 00:39:12,490
Rym: And yeah, I mean really we decided we were gonna show up at two and leave.

599
00:39:12,691 --> 00:39:17,210
Rym: I don't know whenever we finished playing kalis, you know, four or five and let something awesome.

600
00:39:17,392 --> 00:39:25,495
Scott: We ended up staying until pretty much midnight I think but see the thing is though is we would have left maybe at ten if we knew that the Mario tennis was scheduled For nine.

601
00:39:25,535 --> 00:39:35,004
Scott: we didn't look at the schedule because you're idiots And the Mario tennis is scheduled for nine and if we came around to ten and it hadn't happened we probably would have left Yeah, but instead we ended up talking to some more gamers.

602
00:39:35,124 --> 00:39:39,909
Scott: Yeah planes and DS That's all I really did between 10 and midnight was talk to gamers and play DS.

603
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:50,710
Rym: Yep, didn't get another board game in because that board game guy didn't return Yeah, which was fine because I gotta say kalis hurt my brain and I wasn't really in a state to be able to play another.

604
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:53,042
Scott: German is a rough game, but it's an awesome game.

605
00:39:53,263 --> 00:39:54,328
Rym: Yeah, I love it a lot.

606
00:39:54,489 --> 00:39:56,820
Scott: man We're just like totally tease in the next two weeks.

607
00:39:57,543 --> 00:39:58,005
Rym: That's fine.

608
00:39:58,045 --> 00:39:58,789
Rym: Maybe people listen.

609
00:40:01,855 --> 00:40:03,830
Scott: If they're listening now, they're already gonna listen next week.

610
00:40:03,874 --> 00:40:08,730
Rym: Yeah Cuz I will say that of now that we have feeds for all the four days of GeekNights.

611
00:40:09,312 --> 00:40:11,860
Rym: Gaming day is by far the most popular one.

612
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,987
Rym: It has about 40 more listeners than everything else.

613
00:40:14,007 --> 00:40:14,890
Rym: Oh, really?

614
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:18,730
Scott: That's kind of weird because there's a whole lot of competition when it comes to gaming news.

615
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,770
Scott: I mean you can go anywhere to get gaming stuff.

616
00:40:20,871 --> 00:40:21,756
Scott: I mean hell.

617
00:40:21,796 --> 00:40:26,583
Scott: if you want to listen to two guys talking about video games Gamers with jobs radio kicks our ass.

618
00:40:26,885 --> 00:40:27,549
Scott: I listen to it.

619
00:40:27,876 --> 00:40:34,641
Rym: Yep And I mean basically the sci-tech one is the next and anime is almost right under that Even though I don't want to sound conceited.

620
00:40:34,721 --> 00:40:40,349
Rym: but other than anime world order I can't think of any other anime podcast that even comes close to us.

621
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:47,453
Scott: yeah, I mean I've listened to a lot of anime podcast because I tried to get a podcast for each geekery and anime world order.

622
00:40:47,473 --> 00:40:54,018
Scott: they mostly talk about older stuff because they're older than we are and they you know has a slightly different perspective but Also, they know a whole lot.

623
00:40:54,038 --> 00:40:55,950
Scott: So that's what makes their podcast really interesting.

624
00:40:56,111 --> 00:40:59,342
Rym: Yeah, I mean we're the ones who talk like oh this anime sucks blah and we tend to.

625
00:40:59,703 --> 00:41:02,532
Rym: we tend to be more humorous than Informative.

626
00:41:03,033 --> 00:41:12,963
Scott: Yeah, but all the other anime podcasts seem to be like really annoying fan boys Because Naruto is the best anime and I think he could beat up Goku.

627
00:41:12,983 --> 00:41:17,509
Rym: and and my favorite thing is the PSP Because I can play Metal Gear.

628
00:41:20,113 --> 00:41:21,607
Scott: Yeah, I can't take those yeah.

629
00:41:23,072 --> 00:41:29,119
Scott: So it's just weird that like in the most maybe that's why there's so many gaming Podcasts is so many gamers.

630
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,566
Scott: So many people want to listen to one.

631
00:41:30,626 --> 00:41:32,273
Scott: I don't know Whatever.

632
00:41:32,314 --> 00:41:33,518
Scott: listen to whichever day you want.

633
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:34,121
Scott: I don't care.

634
00:41:34,141 --> 00:41:36,550
Rym: Yeah, I just noted that this is our most popular day.

635
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,165
Rym: At least it has been for the last three weeks.

636
00:41:38,569 --> 00:41:42,219
Scott: Go All right, we're gonna close the show out with little meta bits.

637
00:41:42,881 --> 00:41:43,042
Rym: Yep.

638
00:41:43,122 --> 00:41:45,250
Rym: We got a very some praise for you people out there.

639
00:41:45,852 --> 00:41:52,133
Rym: You've all finally started to join the forums and it's gotten to the point where I can't keep up with the forums on a regular Basis anymore.

640
00:41:52,614 --> 00:41:57,790
Scott: Yeah, like it used to be I would have to go say girl people say stuff and now people are saying stuff.

641
00:41:57,871 --> 00:42:05,724
Scott: In fact, you're saying too much stuff, which is great Yeah, so if you didn't join the forums before because they seem too quiet and lonely and empty.

642
00:42:05,905 --> 00:42:12,543
Scott: Well now, you know the What are you called the catch-22 of no one joins because no one joined.

643
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:13,687
Scott: Well, that's over.

644
00:42:13,807 --> 00:42:14,590
Scott: people have joined.

645
00:42:14,771 --> 00:42:15,936
Scott: It's now you can join also.

646
00:42:16,257 --> 00:42:18,025
Rym: Yep, and I'm very I had like.

647
00:42:18,045 --> 00:42:20,997
Rym: I love all you being in there I'm gonna start a flame war again.

648
00:42:21,037 --> 00:42:24,430
Rym: We had that awesome religion argument flame war a while ago.

649
00:42:24,892 --> 00:42:27,308
Rym: I'm trying to think of a new topic that'll get everyone all pissed off.

650
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,454
Scott: Secondly in the forum.

651
00:42:29,534 --> 00:42:37,178
Scott: There's a thread about that has pictures of what front row crew comm is going to look like The newest screenshot.

652
00:42:37,198 --> 00:42:38,908
Scott: I think people seem to really like a lot.

653
00:42:39,129 --> 00:42:46,370
Rym: Yep I mean I think that with maybe Tiny changes based on what people in the forum say is probably gonna be what GeekNights is gonna look like in the coming weeks.

654
00:42:46,651 --> 00:42:53,209
Scott: However, we still need a GeekNights' logo and a front row crew logo would also be good Yep.

655
00:42:53,755 --> 00:43:03,016
Scott: So if you want to make one Like I could go to this website where they have professional graphic designers and pay a hundred bucks and they would give me something That's you know, that would do the job.

656
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:09,498
Rym: or we have I mean literally like 15 friends who are amazing artists Who all said at some point?

657
00:43:09,539 --> 00:43:11,869
Rym: Yeah, we'll make you a logo and they've never actually done it.

658
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:16,290
Rym: Yeah, I don't fault him because they're all busy with school and such but still we don't have anything yet.

659
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:22,230
Scott: So here I'm gonna say right now if you have some ideas for a GeekNights' logo do like a two-second sketch.

660
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:26,329
Scott: I don't want you to do like a whole bunch of work in Photoshop for hours just to say I don't like it.

661
00:43:26,892 --> 00:43:35,250
Scott: so do like a two-second sketch of what you think it's gonna look like and Then scan it and email it to GeekNights at front row crew comm or put it in the forum or something.

662
00:43:35,953 --> 00:43:39,689
Scott: And if we like what you came up with and then I'll give you 50 bucks.

663
00:43:40,472 --> 00:43:46,397
Rym: Not only that but obviously if you I mean if you're if we use what you give us you'll get you know You'll be on that credits page.

664
00:43:46,618 --> 00:43:48,510
Rym: The only other person on that page is DJ pretzel.

665
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:52,584
Scott: Yeah, and your name will be in the fight of every podcast and all kinds of stuff.

666
00:43:52,765 --> 00:43:52,985
Rym: Yeah.

667
00:43:53,206 --> 00:43:54,029
Rym: Well probably interview you.

668
00:43:54,451 --> 00:43:56,157
Scott: Yeah, that too.

669
00:43:56,177 --> 00:43:59,950
Rym: So plus think about it GeekNights is actually starting to grow at a fairly.

670
00:44:00,652 --> 00:44:06,272
Rym: It's growing at a pace to where if we hadn't switched to Libsyn when we did we would have started having bandwidth trouble in Short order.

671
00:44:06,493 --> 00:44:11,809
Scott: Yeah, so you could be you know in the future the person who made the GeekNights' logo And if it's a really good logo.

672
00:44:12,011 --> 00:44:16,410
Scott: Maybe other people looking for logos will come to you and you can start a little logo making business.

673
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:24,363
Rym: Yeah I mean for now the only person who's really given us anything is our friend cad who actually made a fairly awesome little 8-bit style GeekNights thing that I'm thinking of putting on a business card.

674
00:44:24,585 --> 00:44:35,370
Scott: Yeah, that'd be alright but we still need one that'll look good and go to the forum and look in that thread and Actually look at the forum and you notice the top of the form is this blue gradient sort of thing.

675
00:44:35,771 --> 00:44:39,907
Scott: It has to make a logo that will look good on that gradient and you'll be all set.

676
00:44:40,047 --> 00:44:40,750
Rym: Scott's not kidding.

677
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,910
Rym: We'll give you 50 bucks plus all the other stuff.

678
00:44:42,951 --> 00:44:51,536
Rym: We yeah Cuz it's either give you 50 bucks or give some professionals a hundred bucks and we'd always rather get the amateurs or the friends Or the people or the listeners that we know.

679
00:44:51,556 --> 00:44:55,450
Scott: Mm-hmm pretty much always and save 50 bucks to buy a video game.

680
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:57,100
Rym: Yeah that too.

681
00:44:57,585 --> 00:44:57,707
Scott: Yeah.

682
00:44:59,031 --> 00:45:09,449
Scott: So that way, you know when the DS game comes out you can take the 50 bucks I gave you and buy it and I'll take the 50 bucks that I saved and buy one to copy for me and then we'll Play some Wi-Fi action and hopefully I'll kick your ass.

683
00:45:09,851 --> 00:45:15,310
Rym: Yeah, and while we're at it since it's gaming day final final bit if you got DS games put your friend codes up.

684
00:45:15,651 --> 00:45:16,778
Scott: Oh, yeah, we're looking for them.

685
00:45:16,818 --> 00:45:18,950
Scott: Tetris and Metroid friend codes big time now.

686
00:45:19,111 --> 00:45:21,510
Rym: I know we've all been posting them, but we haven't used them a lot lately.

687
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:31,810
Rym: Once we have more free time We're gonna start saying like alright on Sunday from this time this time Eastern everyone in the forums light up and we'll play games.

688
00:45:32,412 --> 00:45:34,501
Scott: Yeah, it's really hard to get a four-player Metroid.

689
00:45:34,521 --> 00:45:36,690
Scott: But if we use the friend codes, I think we can get it on.

690
00:45:37,031 --> 00:45:39,379
Rym: Yeah, and even I mean Mario Kart Tetris anything.

691
00:45:39,419 --> 00:45:44,769
Rym: if we all put our friend codes together and we all just try to connect at The same time we'll all randomly connect to each other.

692
00:45:45,374 --> 00:45:45,696
Scott: Awesome.
