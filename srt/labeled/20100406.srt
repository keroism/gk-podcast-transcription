1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,367
Rym: Hey, it's Tuesday April 6th.

2
00:00:11,628 --> 00:00:12,029
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,875
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:19,056
Rym: after a long Boston hiatus We are back with the PAX East 2010 show.

5
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,208
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:30,697
Rym: It's so weird to be back in my real life.

7
00:00:31,661 --> 00:00:32,348
Scott: Yeah, it's all right.

8
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:40,940
Rym: after that whole week You know we were in Boston for our packs And we had a week going around with the fun spot and everything and then anime Boston and then a flight home.

9
00:00:41,503 --> 00:00:42,852
Rym: And now here we are on Tuesday.

10
00:00:42,873 --> 00:00:43,980
Scott: It's actually weird.

11
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:54,800
Scott: it's like I've almost come back to a new life you know because like Everything's different now that I'm back here like all these things changed while I was away I know think of that we went out and the weather was shitty.

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,540
Rym: It was just rainy and cold and miserable.

13
00:00:56,962 --> 00:01:00,020
Rym: And we came back and the weather's beautiful and it's sunny and the sun's out.

14
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,185
Scott: It's like I can ride my bike to work now Which I wasn't doing before.

15
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:12,040
Scott: and then also there's a. there's a little space in our office where this other I'm not gonna explain all the details, but basically all these people moved out of our office somewhere else.

16
00:01:12,362 --> 00:01:17,309
Scott: There's a whole bunch of empty desks in this one area And you know this is all you know.

17
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,514
Scott: and then the new guy.

18
00:01:18,534 --> 00:01:19,960
Scott: we have a new guy on the tech team.

19
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,750
Scott: So he started working the Monday after PAX East.

20
00:01:23,372 --> 00:01:26,226
Scott: so it's like oh, it's like a completely different world I came back to.

21
00:01:26,246 --> 00:01:27,012
Rym: it was actually weird.

22
00:01:27,032 --> 00:01:31,674
Rym: You know getting back to work I kind of like on this visceral level forgot what it was that I do.

23
00:01:31,694 --> 00:01:33,320
Rym: I mean I get there and I sit down.

24
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,760
Rym: I'm like all right this shit.

25
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:38,009
Rym: Yeah, I remember this.

26
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,640
Rym: I almost forgot one of the passwords.

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,111
Rym: Yeah But how we're back what kind of way.

28
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:48,249
Scott: you're like this super professional place And you've got a situation where there's like a shared password.

29
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:55,399
Rym: No no one of the passwords of my own Uh-huh because I have a lot of systems and a couple of them use different passwords for certain reasons.

30
00:01:55,842 --> 00:02:02,280
Rym: Yeah, hmm, but anyway all that aside We're back and the show be a little odd because we're experimenting with video as you all know.

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:09,500
Rym: So we actually during the week between PAX and anime Boston recorded a series of five to ten minute segments about packs.

32
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,768
Scott: We thought would be podcasting that whole week.

33
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:12,490
Rym: Haha.

34
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,517
Rym: Yeah, we thought we'd stream stuff out of packs.

35
00:02:14,557 --> 00:02:17,028
Rym: that Sprint card And that Verizon card laughed at us.

36
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:23,035
Scott: Yeah, it was all right, but we learned We still uploaded a bunch of youtubes and stuff and other things.

37
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:23,697
Scott: with those it was.

38
00:02:23,778 --> 00:02:26,834
Rym: it was a good deal Yep, but basically this show is a little weird.

39
00:02:26,874 --> 00:02:29,068
Rym: because we have all these segments I'm gonna kind of string them together.

40
00:02:29,531 --> 00:02:39,040
Rym: so if you hear any Discontinuities where we kind of start up again or start up again or talk about something twice That's just because we suck and we're complete unprofessional at this point.

41
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:40,563
Rym: lol.

42
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:48,360
Rym: Because we were trying this new experiment and now we're recording the kind of the rapper to the pack show.

43
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,946
Scott: Yeah, I think it was later.

44
00:02:49,967 --> 00:02:52,979
Scott: I think it was good because we talked about packs while we still remembered it.

45
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:59,060
Rym: Yeah, so everything in the kind of the beginning of this and the end of this is only the memories that shown through.

46
00:02:59,341 --> 00:03:05,857
Rym: I mean, you know kind of the longer you wait after event only the strongest Impressions are the ones that you actually remember enough to talk about.

47
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:10,994
Rym: So it'll be interesting if we do end up repeating anything, but hopefully not so.

48
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:27,433
Rym: PAX East 2010.

49
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:29,278
Scott: So here we are lazy asses.

50
00:03:29,298 --> 00:03:33,872
Scott: we were supposed to make podcasts and videos all week between packs and anime Boston But we didn't.

51
00:03:33,892 --> 00:03:34,795
Rym: yeah, well Monday.

52
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:36,723
Rym: I was basically dead and Tuesday.

53
00:03:36,743 --> 00:03:37,807
Rym: I was almost still.

54
00:03:37,847 --> 00:03:42,505
Scott: we were in New Hampshire And Wednesday, we're coming back from New Hampshire and eating dinner.

55
00:03:42,565 --> 00:03:43,508
Rym: and now it's Thursday.

56
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:46,538
Scott: Thursday We went to MIT and tomorrow's anime Boston.

57
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:55,049
Scott: So we really didn't make the podcast and videos We thought we would make while we were sitting around in hotels doing nothing because we didn't really sitting around hotels doing nothing.

58
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,353
Scott: all That much until now.

59
00:03:56,373 --> 00:03:56,875
Scott: Yeah.

60
00:03:57,356 --> 00:04:01,168
Scott: Hey, it's anime Boston's tomorrow and so excited.

61
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:03,266
Scott: Yeah Can really easily hide it.

62
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:06,856
Scott: We're gonna do our packs.

63
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:09,606
Scott: wrap up review ish PAX East.

64
00:04:09,947 --> 00:04:15,850
Scott: review a show While it is fresh in our minds because come Monday will have a brain full of anime Boston.

65
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,550
Rym: Well, I feel like it's weird doing this.

66
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,704
Rym: I'm so used to doing like the show with like a microphone like up in my face doing the like.

67
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,292
Rym: I don't worry about the I don't.

68
00:04:22,313 --> 00:04:23,518
Rym: I feel like we're a little stilted right now.

69
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:24,824
Scott: We are quite used it up.

70
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:25,627
Rym: So packs.

71
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:38,137
Rym: Holy shit we were at PAX East 2010 the first PAX East and The amazing thing about is that you know We were we did the like preview show and we kept having that disclaimer that if it's not as awesome If we've been making these packs is out to be.

72
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:39,443
Rym: it's not our fault.

73
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:41,190
Rym: You know, it's a new packs new location.

74
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:43,880
Rym: we don't know a hundred percent what it's gonna be like.

75
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,121
Rym: for all.

76
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:48,601
Rym: we know they're gonna cock it up and I'm pleased to report that they did not cock it up.

77
00:04:48,661 --> 00:04:52,035
Rym: In fact, I would say it was like it was 95% packs.

78
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,586
Scott: It was definitely 95% PAX West.

79
00:04:54,807 --> 00:04:55,610
Scott: I mean what was different?

80
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,246
Rym: The only difference was that the convention center in Seattle lets Joko sing for like an extra two hours.

81
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:04,309
Scott: Yeah, I mean They're really everybody fits in main events pretty much.

82
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:04,867
Scott: Yeah.

83
00:05:05,552 --> 00:05:07,638
Scott: So PAX East it was PAX West.

84
00:05:07,678 --> 00:05:13,481
Scott: if you're worried about what PAX West was like and you've been to PAX East you pretty much know It's the real deal.

85
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:14,709
Scott: PAX is PAX is PAX.

86
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:16,114
Scott: I'm pretty confident.

87
00:05:16,134 --> 00:05:21,670
Scott: they can pull off packs anywhere in the US that they want probably maybe anywhere in the world probably anywhere in Canada.

88
00:05:22,152 --> 00:05:27,750
Scott: You know other countries is still yet to be seen, you know language barrier cultural differences, you know.

89
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,670
Scott: I mean, I don't think packs China would work really or I think the back Scotland would go pretty well.

90
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,197
Rym: There's a lot of Scottish people at this guy.

91
00:05:33,238 --> 00:05:35,790
Scott: I think a packs in the UK anywhere in the english-speaking world.

92
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:42,714
Rym: They could probably rock a packs, you know, they could do like a French packs But they'd have to get like all local enforcers They could probably do a.

93
00:05:42,774 --> 00:05:45,485
Scott: German packs would probably do equally the same.

94
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:45,987
Rym: I think so.

95
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:50,270
Rym: I think so All right, yeah, but I mean it was great.

96
00:05:50,772 --> 00:05:58,102
Rym: The only problem with packs that anyone is that a real complaint about this is a legitimate concern Is that the main events hall was tiny like you did.

97
00:05:58,463 --> 00:05:59,246
Rym: it was crazy.

98
00:05:59,287 --> 00:06:08,168
Rym: at PAX West, you know The room doesn't fit everybody for like the concerts and everything But people if you wait like 20 minutes after the concert starts you can just get in and like the keynote

99
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,457
Scott: you could just get into the concerts at PAX East -

100
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:13,955
Rym: well the Friday concert definitely the Saturday concert was actually Almost like.

101
00:06:13,995 --> 00:06:16,029
Rym: it was pretty much almost at capacity the whole time.

102
00:06:16,231 --> 00:06:19,166
Scott: Yeah, but people are still walking in and out that you could go to the bathroom.

103
00:06:19,206 --> 00:06:19,809
Scott: You can come back.

104
00:06:20,111 --> 00:06:24,729
Rym: Yeah, you know, it was notice how the omega-thon finale and especially the keynote and the opening.

105
00:06:24,749 --> 00:06:30,208
Rym: sir You know the stuff people really wanted to go that Every single person going to the con no matter what wanted to go to the keynote and the Q&A.

106
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,538
Scott: Well, those are those are times when there was.

107
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,963
Scott: there were seats in there.

108
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,610
Scott: Remember closing ceremonies had no seats.

109
00:06:35,814 --> 00:06:46,345
Scott: Yeah, right So everyone can fit in and the doors were still well luckily because not everyone who was at the con went to that But the keynote and the open the queue and the first Q&A panel.

110
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:47,790
Scott: right they were at capacity.

111
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,863
Scott: I'm pretty sure I don't know this for certain cuz I didn't go to them.

112
00:06:50,903 --> 00:06:54,061
Scott: that Q&A to you know Make a strip panel etc.

113
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,250
Scott: Were also capacity.

114
00:06:55,271 --> 00:06:56,633
Scott: Yeah Cuz those were.

115
00:06:56,793 --> 00:07:02,197
Scott: those are events in main events where the receipts and not just openness cuz that's the one thing about packs that anime Cons don't have.

116
00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:06,330
Rym: the culture is definitely You go to everything in the main events or at least everything you want.

117
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,030
Rym: Like the main events kind of are the anchor of the whole con like they're the biggest things.

118
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,408
Rym: they're so big that like the majority people go to many of them.

119
00:07:13,428 --> 00:07:17,910
Rym: and The trouble is just that that main events hall in this convention center is way too small.

120
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:26,169
Rym: Yeah, it has an upper deck, which is really nice, but it doesn't seem that many people up there I think they said the total capacity upper and lower was fifty five hundred people not enough.

121
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:27,997
Scott: No, they need like seven thousand.

122
00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:31,390
Rym: cuz they were what there were I think about sixteen thousand people at PAX East.

123
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:37,410
Rym: Yeah They need a seven or eight thousand capacity main events or they need to move somewhere where they could fit the entire con.

124
00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:43,370
Rym: Like Otakon does that well with the mariner arena they can fit the entire con into the cosplay thing.

125
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,677
Scott: Is it an anime convention?

126
00:07:44,717 --> 00:07:47,029
Scott: The only main event anyone wants to go to is the cosplay?

127
00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:48,529
Rym: Yeah, I feel like we could fix that.

128
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,469
Rym: I mean we gotta have more keynotes like the New York anime festival.

129
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,092
Rym: They did that.

130
00:07:51,113 --> 00:07:53,846
Rym: they had a keynote and I think more compact.

131
00:07:53,886 --> 00:07:54,610
Scott: they packed the room.

132
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:58,670
Scott: Yeah, it wasn't a big main events room, but it was the biggest room they had and they tried.

133
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,001
Scott: They were originally intending to put that in a smaller room.

134
00:08:01,021 --> 00:08:01,383
Scott: Yeah.

135
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:02,387
Scott: Yeah, so it was.

136
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:02,890
Scott: it was good.

137
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:06,125
Rym: It proves that you can do it, but you know official news.

138
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,310
Rym: This is I'm sure it's out there.

139
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:15,810
Rym: It was announced at PAX to us by many people But PAX is moving and PAX East is not going to be at the Heinz Convention Center because the heinz is way too tiny.

140
00:08:15,971 --> 00:08:23,790
Scott: We're gonna be it's still gonna be in Boston at a convention center We did not know existed called the BC EC and I have done a cursory amount of research.

141
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:29,187
Scott: The BC EC appears to be about as big as the Baltimore Convention Center, which is Otakon.

142
00:08:29,227 --> 00:08:30,150
Rym: that but it's 20.

143
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:36,850
Scott: It might not it might not be exactly as big I think it is smaller, but it is still in that same size category.

144
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:46,307
Scott: You know gigantic rooms with hundreds of thousands of square feet with really tall ceiling But also many whole bunch of small rooms, you know the same sort of deal.

145
00:08:46,387 --> 00:08:53,405
Scott: So PAX East will be in Boston in the BC EC Probably next year and probably for the next three years after that.

146
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:54,430
Rym: We'll see how that works.

147
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,520
Rym: I mean on one hand the convent that's bigger.

148
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,730
Rym: I mean even if it's the size of the BCC in Baltimore.

149
00:08:58,991 --> 00:09:03,706
Rym: So 25,000 people packs could grow another 10,000 and then be at capacity again.

150
00:09:03,987 --> 00:09:05,010
Rym: It's quite possible.

151
00:09:05,151 --> 00:09:07,749
Rym: I think it'll sell out there no matter how many people they can fit.

152
00:09:08,492 --> 00:09:17,152
Rym: Oh, I honestly think that the PAX East could have if there were no limit on registrations Forty to fifty thousand bodies not the bullshit turnstile They can see.

153
00:09:17,172 --> 00:09:27,271
Scott: what I'm worried about mostly is that you know there because an enforcer is so great You know, they can have a very low ratio of enforcer to attend 80 enforcers to 16,000.

154
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:28,837
Scott: I don't think it was an 80 enforcers.

155
00:09:28,877 --> 00:09:29,479
Rym: That's what they said.

156
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,090
Scott: Yeah, we'll see but there were about 80 enforcers.

157
00:09:32,473 --> 00:09:33,380
Scott: We'll have to look that up.

158
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:42,030
Scott: Anyway, the thing is If you have if you spread the geography a gigantic convention center where covering ground is not trivial, right?

159
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,906
Scott: You're gonna need a lot more enforcers and they might have to accept every every person who applies.

160
00:09:47,926 --> 00:09:49,330
Scott: It's gonna be pretty interesting.

161
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,589
Rym: Yeah, I don't think they should tear it.

162
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,805
Rym: If anything like even the lowest lowest like if you're just volunteering and all you're doing is directing people.

163
00:09:55,147 --> 00:09:56,030
Rym: You're still an enforcer.

164
00:09:56,094 --> 00:10:06,740
Rym: Yeah but they might have to tear up as opposed to tear down when you've got enforcers and Not totally committed enforcer but like arch enforcer they give them some cool title I don't know, but they're gonna need.

165
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,787
Scott: they're gonna need a lot of enforcers And if that's what you want to do, you should sign up.

166
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:12,821
Rym: Yes However, I point out a lot of the front row crew were enforcers.

167
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:14,609
Rym: a lot of people we know were enforcers.

168
00:10:15,111 --> 00:10:17,664
Rym: Every single one of them said that they had an amazing time.

169
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:18,790
Rym: Yeah, it's totally awesome.

170
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:23,450
Scott: The only thing is like, you know, occasionally someone would be an enforcer and I'd be like, hey, let's go to dinner tonight.

171
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:23,851
Scott: They'd be like.

172
00:10:23,892 --> 00:10:27,906
Scott: I got my shift, you know, but they didn't skip their shift.

173
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:29,010
Scott: They did not want to do it.

174
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,756
Scott: They went to the shift and enjoyed the shift.

175
00:10:30,957 --> 00:10:34,750
Rym: Yeah, they row lost her voice as an enforcer teaching people how to play games.

176
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:36,670
Rym: That's not even she doesn't have to do that.

177
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,983
Rym: It's not like the enforcer like you have to spend four hours teaching people to play games.

178
00:10:40,285 --> 00:10:40,666
Rym: She did that.

179
00:10:40,686 --> 00:10:41,530
Rym: cuz it's fucking awesome.

180
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:45,163
Scott: Yep, and you know, it's like I can't do these other things you're doing cuz.

181
00:10:45,183 --> 00:10:47,954
Scott: I got a shift for a part of the day But they didn't care.

182
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:48,917
Scott: they'd probably do it again.

183
00:10:48,937 --> 00:10:53,456
Rym: Plus all I mean the PAX party for the enforcers I mean, I saw the tweets.

184
00:10:53,496 --> 00:10:54,682
Rym: people like oh my god.

185
00:10:54,903 --> 00:10:56,250
Rym: I got coup to sign something.

186
00:10:56,391 --> 00:10:58,260
Rym: I got you know, Mike and Jerry to sign stuff.

187
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,646
Rym: Apparently was badass time.

188
00:10:59,827 --> 00:10:59,907
Rym: No.

189
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:01,148
Rym: All right I was asleep.

190
00:11:01,632 --> 00:11:03,661
Scott: So we got a list of things that went down at PAX.

191
00:11:03,701 --> 00:11:06,613
Scott: you want to go down this list or we could go semi Chronologically.

192
00:11:06,894 --> 00:11:07,636
Rym: go through our.

193
00:11:07,677 --> 00:11:09,102
Scott: my list is not chronological.

194
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,145
Scott: So it's gonna be tough.

195
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,310
Scott: How about your list?

196
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,498
Rym: My list is not in any way chronological.

197
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:16,310
Scott: So let us just go down the lists and pick stuff.

198
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,909
Rym: All right, let's start right away with the main events because we know we get to PAX.

199
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,710
Rym: Well, no, let's go even further out because we got to do the meta about other cons.

200
00:11:22,172 --> 00:11:25,450
Rym: So you get to PAX and there's no line because they mail out the badges.

201
00:11:27,952 --> 00:11:30,383
Rym: Seriously any convention that's more than a couple thousand people.

202
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:32,010
Rym: You've got to mail out these fucking bad.

203
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:36,490
Scott: Yeah, I just I just picked up my badge for anime Boston like a couple hours ago, right?

204
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,670
Scott: There was basically no, you know, not much of a line.

205
00:11:39,711 --> 00:11:44,329
Rym: It was like a 10-minute line But even then we had to wait and it was a little bit of trouble anyway.

206
00:11:44,651 --> 00:11:49,130
Rym: Obviously they need look at all that they had like 20 staff and this is the Thursday badge pick up.

207
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:54,974
Rym: I don't know what the Friday is gonna be like but like 20 staffers have to sit there Thursday night for like five hours Doing these badges.

208
00:11:55,316 --> 00:11:57,667
Rym: what if they just didn't do that at all and just mailed them at PAX?

209
00:11:57,848 --> 00:12:05,035
Rym: every PAX We've walked up to zero line usually even like one staffer who's like, oh Here is says badge.

210
00:12:05,136 --> 00:12:06,641
Rym: Shall I warm says crock pipe.

211
00:12:06,922 --> 00:12:07,103
Rym: Yep.

212
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:12,187
Scott: I like a warm crack pipe Let me tell you and hacks is the only con that provides.

213
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:15,805
Rym: Yep So everyone already had their badges and that you know, the thing was gonna open.

214
00:12:15,845 --> 00:12:19,497
Rym: we got in an hour early So we walked around all the stuff but there wasn't much to do.

215
00:12:19,578 --> 00:12:25,721
Rym: basically all we did was wander around and look at all the stuff and Check out like, you know, like the steel battalion room.

216
00:12:25,741 --> 00:12:26,564
Rym: We'll talk about later.

217
00:12:26,684 --> 00:12:30,356
Scott: Well, yeah, there's a you know, basically here Here's all the rooms that they have at PAX.

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:38,496
Scott: Yeah, I got three panel rooms Naga wyvern and Naga wyvern was or was the serpent.

220
00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:39,840

00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,508
Scott: serpent was at PAX West manticore manticore.

222
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:42,929

Scott: We were only.

225
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:51,363
Scott: we were only in the wyvern theaters Sort of medium-sized, you know, the Naga was the biggest.

226
00:12:51,965 --> 00:12:53,089
Scott: I didn't go in the manticore.

227
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,518
Rym: one I thought the manticore was the biggest.

228
00:12:54,558 --> 00:12:56,068
Scott: was the matter remember at all?

229
00:12:56,711 --> 00:12:58,335
Scott: Yeah, sure.

Rym: Awesome doesn't matter.

231
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,306
Rym: every panel filled up with rare exceptions.

232
00:13:02,687 --> 00:13:06,076
Scott: There was the Tabletop gaming areas.

233
00:13:06,096 --> 00:13:06,939
Scott: There are many of them.

234
00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:08,705
Scott: There was the watsy areas, of course.

235
00:13:08,846 --> 00:13:10,010
Rym: Yeah, there was like role-playing.

236

Scott: There are hallways outside of tabletop had stuff in them Like, you know watsy had a little thing going on and the.

237
00:13:17,122 --> 00:13:20,876

00:13:29,764 --> 00:13:30,687
Scott: That was pretty happening.

241
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:36,670
Rym: while it was pretty awesome I got to admit it wasn't even close to as awesome as the one that Katsucon used to have with video told me.

242
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:42,924
Scott: there was the Jam space provided by magfest where you can go and rock some music.

243
00:13:43,346 --> 00:13:44,854
Rym: magfest, by the way We're going to.

Rym: I were like magfest.

254
00:14:01,503 --> 00:14:01,745
Rym: Hells.

255
00:14:01,786 --> 00:14:05,078
Scott: Yeah Yeah I had heard of the magfest but I did not know.

256
00:14:05,118 --> 00:14:05,941
Rym: you realize the.

257
00:14:06,201 --> 00:14:10,403
Rym: the official yell of magfest is the colossus yell from the x-men arcade game.

258
00:14:10,423 --> 00:14:21,040
Rym: Oh Yeah, man, if you're the blob nothing moves you don't go anywhere near magfest, yeah The expo hall which wasn't, you know, we peaked.

259
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,230
Rym: we could look in but they didn't let us in early.

260
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:25,450
Scott: Yeah, we did walk around the expo hall.

261
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:35,210
Scott: It was not really as it had the same sort of level of you know Big-time companies, but I didn't have the quantity that the PAX West Xbox West had the turtle van.

262
00:14:35,611 --> 00:14:40,770
Scott: Yeah, I mean I walked through the PAX East expo hall basically once looked at a bunch of stuff and that was it.

263
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,100
Rym: I know there was no line to get in.

264
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,290
Rym: We just walked right in the whole con.

265
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,535
Rym: You just walk right in walk around.

266
00:14:44,555 --> 00:14:52,309
Rym: Yeah, I think part of it was there weren't that many crazy new games being I mean what there was Starcraft 2 but everyone cares about it like really there's a tournament of it.

267
00:14:52,550 --> 00:15:01,506
Rym: Yes, but everyone who already cares about it already has a pirated cop or the beta or yeah They're playing like they're hacked beta like they've got their thing a big thing in the expo hall.

268
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:06,332
Scott: number one above everything else is sim 5 Civ 5, Civ 5.

269
00:15:06,332 --> 00:15:11,770
Rym: See Civ 3 was a revolution like they changed everything they made like they added culture like it was a brand new game.

270
00:15:12,295 --> 00:15:16,700
Rym: Civ 4 was Civ 3 Perfected in my opinion like they took everything that was good in Civ 3.

271
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,945
Scott: Civ 5 is a brand new game again.

272
00:15:18,005 --> 00:15:20,353
Rym: Yeah, so this is Thing is?

273
00:15:20,413 --> 00:15:21,721
Rym: I jumped on the Civ 5 bandwagon.

274
00:15:21,741 --> 00:15:22,566
Rym: I was sort of mad.

275
00:15:22,646 --> 00:15:24,939
Scott: on Civ 5 I was like, all right another Civ.

276
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,790
Rym: I knew some of the change but then you saw the same thing.

277
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,068
Rym: I saw that poster of George Washington like he's like.

278
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:31,802
Scott: And I'm like, yes, George.

279
00:15:31,882 --> 00:15:33,830
Scott: I'll play Civ 5.

280
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,196
Scott: Take me take my money.

281
00:15:35,236 --> 00:15:35,698
Scott: Here you go.

282
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:37,726
Rym: Well, the thing is I'm walking around the revolution.

283
00:15:37,967 --> 00:15:38,770
Rym: I saw that poster.

284
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:45,992
Rym: I was like, oh shit There's another one for Bismarck with his pointy hat just looking at me like I will disapprove you do not play Civ 5.

285
00:15:45,992 --> 00:15:48,170
Rym: But then I saw this other poster of this hex board.

286
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,701
Rym: I'm like, oh is this like a settlers game or something?

287
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:55,473
Rym: Then I realized that's Civ 5 Hexes.

288
00:15:55,493 --> 00:15:56,316
Scott: Civ 5 is the win.

289
00:15:56,758 --> 00:15:57,481
Scott: actually you could have.

290
00:15:57,621 --> 00:15:59,990
Scott: the reason there was a big line was not to play Civ 5.

291
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:04,085
Scott: It was to sign up to go see the Civ 5 demo which is sort of private.

292
00:16:04,266 --> 00:16:07,590
Scott: our poor friend Scott Johnson God Johnson got to go see the Civ 5.

293
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,451
Rym: However, he got shafted out of it like twice before he got it Like.

294
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:15,010
Scott: he did eventually get it though and he told us about a whole bunch of awesome shit in Civ 5.

295
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,058
Scott: We'll have to maybe interview.

296
00:16:16,098 --> 00:16:16,501
Rym: I don't know.

297
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:17,790
Rym: thing is what am I gonna do?

298
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,319
Rym: We could do like a preview of Civ 5, but here's the deal.

299
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:21,322
Rym: This is like NS2.

300
00:16:21,844 --> 00:16:23,550
Rym: I'm buying it pre-order sight unseen.

301
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:27,910
Scott: Yeah, I'm putting all my eggs in that that might even buy the retail if it comes with a big book.

302
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:31,830
Rym: You know some get some games, you know, like when Smash Brothers Melee came out you're like, you know what?

303
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,658
Rym: I'm gonna be all in from the start.

304
00:16:33,718 --> 00:16:34,964
Rym: I'm gonna buy this game today.

305
00:16:34,984 --> 00:16:36,230
Rym: I'm gonna play it that entire day.

306
00:16:36,511 --> 00:16:40,190
Rym: Yep, I'm not taking a day off at work for Civ 5 because it's gonna be a single-player.

307
00:16:40,451 --> 00:16:43,523
Rym: It's gonna be a single-player experience for a while before we multiplayer it.

308
00:16:43,984 --> 00:16:45,430
Scott: You want to talk about the other expo hall stuff?

309
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:49,262
Rym: Yeah, there was some cool stuff in there actually like Monday night combat.

310
00:16:49,422 --> 00:16:51,550
Scott: I'm actually well thing is Monday night combat.

311
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,639
Scott: It looks like a Team Fortress kind of game, right?

312
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,010
Scott: But it's third-person Xbox kind of situation.

313
00:16:56,371 --> 00:16:57,756
Scott: Well, there's a class.

314
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:05,262
Rym: it looks and like the play looks and feels just from watching other people play it Exactly, like all those awesome old like quake 2 mods felt.

315
00:17:05,723 --> 00:17:05,925
Scott: Yep.

316
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:08,013
Rym: The only thing it is not an FPS There's a sport.

317
00:17:08,315 --> 00:17:11,030
Scott: The only thing with it is as one of those, you know upgrading things.

318
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:13,690
Scott: But the thing is right the upgrades.

319
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:15,637
Scott: They sort of validate them.

320
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:21,619
Scott: like the way it works is if you're good at playing Monday night combat Which is a sport right a sport.

321
00:17:22,203 --> 00:17:25,896
Scott: you get people Virtual people to sponsor you.

322
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:34,283
Scott: like Tiger Woods is sponsored by Nike and they being your sponsors, you know And you know you endorsing their products they give you their better products.

323
00:17:34,564 --> 00:17:36,570
Scott: you get better endorsements as you get better.

324
00:17:36,851 --> 00:17:39,842
Scott: So they actually have a metaphor for the upgrades that make sense.

325
00:17:40,104 --> 00:17:41,770
Scott: That doesn't make them feel like cheating.

326
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,529
Scott: I mean is Tiger Woods cheating when he gets better golf clubs from Nike?

327
00:17:45,452 --> 00:17:51,790
Scott: No, so am I cheating if I get plus three guns from gun soft in Monday night combat?

328
00:17:52,253 --> 00:17:54,747
Scott: It does it, you know, it doesn't feel like it's unfair.

329
00:17:54,847 --> 00:17:57,078
Rym: Well part of it It'll depend on how because they explained it.

330
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,028
Rym: so it'll depend a lot about how the game actually is.

331
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,241
Rym: I mean we watched it and the gameplay looked right up our alley.

332
00:18:02,261 --> 00:18:02,863
Rym: It looked twitchy.

333
00:18:03,345 --> 00:18:04,570
Rym: It looked like control mattered.

334
00:18:05,032 --> 00:18:07,640
Rym: It looked like there was some asymmetry like the classes and everything.

335
00:18:08,142 --> 00:18:10,450
Rym: it had all the look of like a weapons factors.

336
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:11,739
Scott: I didn't actually play it though.

337
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,150
Scott: So we're gonna see when it comes out.

338
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,583
Scott: I'm gonna try out some demo if they have one and then I'll buy it.

339
00:18:16,623 --> 00:18:20,798
Rym: maybe I think it's a game that could foster a Community like a community of players like I really get into it.

340
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,083
Rym: if they start like.

341
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:29,030
Rym: if they made like videos of games and highlights Like what if they made a show for this game that was like the highlights this week from all the servers?

342
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:29,633
Rym: That'd be cool.

343
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:32,670
Rym: They could really do something with this all points bulletin.

344
00:18:33,273 --> 00:18:37,270
Rym: I heard tell that this might be a subscription model game in which case I'm almost done with it.

345
00:18:37,431 --> 00:18:37,933
Rym: Yeah, I just give.

346
00:18:37,953 --> 00:18:41,650
Scott: well, there was a very old game called all points bullet and actually played it at fun spot.

347
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,778
Rym: Yeah, I used to play a game at tilt when I was.

348
00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:51,630
Scott: yeah, it's basically a driving game where you pull up behind Criminals and pull the your cop and you pull them over your driving guy litters you pull them over.

349
00:18:51,671 --> 00:18:53,054
Rym: Oh, no, really You know what that game was.

350
00:18:53,316 --> 00:19:02,373
Rym: you crash into every wall because it's really hard then you lose and put another quarter And when you crash you get demerits and too many demerits you get fired and that that cop with the big fat gut and the Cigar yells at you.

351
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:06,870
Scott: Yeah, so there's a new game and it's basically it looks like Grand Theft Auto, right?

352
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,033
Scott: except it's versus.

353
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:14,942
Scott: some people are enforcers and some people are criminals and the criminals are trying to crime and the enforcer people are Trying to enforce to uncry man.

354
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:15,426
Rym: I cry.

355
00:19:15,466 --> 00:19:16,050
Rym: Yeah a bite.

356
00:19:16,391 --> 00:19:20,630
Scott: So it's like a versus multiplayer grant team Grand Theft Auto and that is cool.

357
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:23,961
Scott: But if it's a subscription game screw that it depends it.

358
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:30,398
Rym: What if it was what we always wanted like a large Persistent actually massive actually multi.

359
00:19:30,418 --> 00:19:31,019
Rym: It's not.

360
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,507
Scott: it's like a four-on-four instanced kind of game.

361
00:19:33,568 --> 00:19:34,310
Scott: Yeah, that's what it looked.

362
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,955
Rym: You know, we got to see we.

363
00:19:36,015 --> 00:19:40,530
Rym: I mean literally all we saw of it was we watch people play it from online.

364
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,458
Rym: Yeah, yeah, those people all sucked at it.

365
00:19:42,678 --> 00:19:44,586
Rym: Yeah, I watched one guy like he's.

366
00:19:44,807 --> 00:19:55,402
Rym: he gets in a car He's like chasing a criminal and he literally gets in the car drives about two feet and then just like swerves right into a pole We played what was the game called afro bot or something like that?

367
00:19:55,844 --> 00:19:57,450
Rym: It was basically robotron.

368
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:01,790
Scott: It was basically robotron, you know, then we played the multiplayer which is versus robotron.

369
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,092
Scott: Which was?

370
00:20:02,173 --> 00:20:02,354
Scott: it was?

371
00:20:02,414 --> 00:20:04,349
Rym: obviously it was a beta like it was on like the Nintendo dev.

372
00:20:04,631 --> 00:20:07,126
Scott: It was on the Wii on a Nintendo dev kit, right?

373
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:07,730
Scott: It was okay.

374
00:20:07,931 --> 00:20:10,827
Rym: We spend more time looking at the dev kit like oh, we've never seen one in person.

375
00:20:10,847 --> 00:20:11,310
Rym: Check this out.

376
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,361
Scott: Yeah, but this the the single player is robotron Zelda.

377
00:20:15,401 --> 00:20:20,930
Scott: like you walk from room to room getting items that let you go to new Areas and you get you know open up secrets.

378
00:20:21,312 --> 00:20:29,130
Scott: But you know, I'm just imagine if Zelda Zelda 1 instead of stabbing a sword You use two sticks one to move and one to shoot just like robotron style.

379
00:20:29,694 --> 00:20:31,890
Scott: That's what this game is and that's pretty freaking cool.

380
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:42,003
Rym: I'm excited for that single player and while I would prefer the kind of you know Two sticks they actually did pretty well with the idea that you move with you know The stick but then use the wiimote to kind of like turn and it works.

381
00:20:42,144 --> 00:20:43,690
Scott: Yeah, it does the control work just fine.

382
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:43,833
Scott: It was.

383
00:20:43,854 --> 00:20:44,590
Scott: the versus was fun.

384
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:52,738
Rym: It was broken because you know It was like this demo obviously and Alex was like in the upper corner and I just kept shooting bouncy balls at the corner And he's gonna leave.

385
00:20:52,758 --> 00:20:54,488
Rym: I blew myself up.

386
00:20:55,392 --> 00:21:00,950
Scott: You know if Atari combat had better controls than it does on the Atari combat We were the best fucking games ever it does.

387
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:06,447
Scott: But if it had perfect controls You could just lock someone into a corner and keep nailing him and nailing him and nailing him and it be over.

388
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:08,093
Rym: now because you make The maps different.

389
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,017
Rym: you put constraints in.

390
00:21:09,057 --> 00:21:18,929
Rym: the map we played on was not complex enough to offer an interesting sort of game But what this proves is that more and more what I like are these games that are very direct distilled combat between people.

391
00:21:19,271 --> 00:21:20,035
Scott: Well combat.

392
00:21:20,397 --> 00:21:20,618
Scott: Yeah.

393
00:21:20,638 --> 00:21:22,790
Rym: Oh, so what was the name of that Yakuza game?

394
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,121
Rym: We were looking at Yakuza because we'd heard.

395
00:21:25,141 --> 00:21:27,050
Rym: I heard about this game, but I didn't really think about it.

396
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,703
Scott: Yeah, I knew there was a game called Yakuza.

397
00:21:28,784 --> 00:21:29,530
Scott: I knew it was popular.

398
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,948
Scott: I knew people liked it, but I never played it and they had it at the Sega booth and I played it.

399
00:21:33,854 --> 00:21:35,227
Scott: I didn't realize that it was.

400
00:21:35,348 --> 00:21:40,601
Scott: you know At least the newest version is a full Yakuza simulator 100%.

401
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:48,995
Scott: every aspect of Yakuza life from drinking alcohol to playing pool to driving cool cars to everything Yakuza does is fully simulated.

402
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:50,580
Scott: there is the when you play pool.

403
00:21:51,001 --> 00:21:54,993
Scott: it might as well be a full-on billiards game like 100%.

404
00:21:54,993 --> 00:21:58,465
Scott: you could take that out of the game and sell it on its own as a billiards game.

405
00:21:58,485 --> 00:21:59,509
Scott: that is better than most.

406
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:08,913
Rym: I Mean I think the moment where I realized I didn't like I was wrong about this game is when Scott You know he plays and he walks into his Hawaiian shirt like you do Yakuza.

407
00:22:08,933 --> 00:22:11,866
Rym: then he walks into a fancy bar and he goes up to the bartender.

408
00:22:11,886 --> 00:22:19,073
Rym: the bartender's like, you know He says some things and they sit down and then it gives you this menu of like a hundred different kinds of beer and sake And wine.

409
00:22:19,434 --> 00:22:20,017
Rym: so we go down.

410
00:22:20,077 --> 00:22:24,596
Rym: Scott buys like this heap of sake and then it gives you like this Multiparagraph explanation of like.

411
00:22:24,857 --> 00:22:26,224
Rym: well, this is this kind of sake.

412
00:22:26,265 --> 00:22:28,094
Rym: these kinds of people drink it It tastes like this.

413
00:22:28,676 --> 00:22:30,826
Rym: and then a little bit about the history of like Yakuza drinking.

414
00:22:30,866 --> 00:22:33,115
Scott: and after I drank it I got some experience points.

415
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:35,345
Rym: You're leveling up yours that Yakuza ways.

416
00:22:35,385 --> 00:22:36,610
Rym: I kind of want to be a Yakuza now.

417
00:22:37,072 --> 00:22:38,820
Rym: Yeah, that was a good game or the very least.

418
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,784
Rym: I want to go to Japan.

419
00:22:39,845 --> 00:22:40,990
Rym: We're like a Hawaiian shirt.

420
00:22:41,251 --> 00:22:45,430
Rym: Maybe you have like a big fake tattoo and just walk around like the guys in Yakuza and scare everybody.

421
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:53,285
Scott: The only other thing I remember from the expo hall because I didn't spend too much time in there was that Nvidia actually dimmed live demos of its 3d stuff.

422
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:59,367
Scott: Yeah, which I mean I could do with my video shuttered glasses that are wired into the thing and then the screen.

423
00:22:59,648 --> 00:23:02,355
Rym: they were wireless Polarized that wasn't.

424
00:23:02,597 --> 00:23:06,737
Scott: I thought it was the shuttered ones with the battery But they weren't wired in anything.

425
00:23:06,757 --> 00:23:08,101
Rym: that was the don't steal me wire.

426
00:23:08,302 --> 00:23:10,148
Rym: Okay, and it's 3d.

427
00:23:10,228 --> 00:23:11,690
Rym: It's just I don't know It's not worth the money yet.

428
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,414
Rym: I mean a weighty.

429
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:14,606
Scott: it goes deep in but it doesn't pop out.

430
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:24,230
Scott: but that was a Apparently a decision of the game developer not a decision of you know You could make a game where the 3d comes out of the screen But people seem to only do it where it goes deep into the screen.

431
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,299
Rym: I can see why cuz pop out is really disconcerting.

432
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:30,056
Rym: if pop out and then you change your angle and then like goes off the edge Of the screen it disappears.

433
00:23:30,277 --> 00:23:31,966
Rym: Yeah, and it looked great.

434
00:23:32,147 --> 00:23:37,190
Rym: It's just My opinion as a gamer is that if you just wait like a year, it'll be ubiquitous.

435
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:44,070
Rym: Just wait until you buy a new computer and the video card has the two DVI outs for 3d and just comes with the glasses.

436
00:23:44,372 --> 00:23:45,238
Rym: Yeah, they will come.

437
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:47,070
Scott: I'm gonna wait until it's like a standard.

438
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,569
Scott: It's set in stone not while it's still some flaky thing.

439
00:23:50,031 --> 00:23:56,510
Scott: Ati had their a demo of the whatever they call it where you can get a shit ton of monitors on one video card.

440
00:23:56,691 --> 00:23:59,470
Scott: They had four HDMI outs coming out of one card.

441
00:23:59,550 --> 00:23:59,671
Scott: It was.

442
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:00,875
Scott: it was pretty ridiculous.

443
00:24:00,995 --> 00:24:07,440
Rym: now doing it in like the wall mode like six monitors was kind of annoying because you have the bars But when they play the racing games, there's just.

444
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:09,730
Scott: I think I think it was eight and they had an SLI.

445
00:24:09,912 --> 00:24:18,195
Scott: Well, I don't know if ati calls it SLI But they had a two card setup with eight display port cables going to eight ultra sharps in a two by four Right.

446
00:24:18,236 --> 00:24:19,324
Scott: That was pretty impressive.

447
00:24:21,072 --> 00:24:23,510
Scott: But the racing who and who is really gonna get right?

448
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,830
Scott: I mean buying one video card that is for display port outs.

449
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,939
Scott: That's pretty good because you can get two ultra sharps and hook them up frickin sweet.

450
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:35,582
Scott: Yeah, right getting with three video cards with eight Nobody has eight ultra sharps.

451
00:24:35,823 --> 00:24:36,670
Scott: It is not gonna happen.

452
00:24:36,931 --> 00:24:38,395
Rym: However, you know who's gonna use that?

453
00:24:38,415 --> 00:24:44,655
Rym: a lot of companies who get demo their games are gonna do that people like in exhibit halls Maybe conventions.

454
00:24:44,675 --> 00:24:46,261
Rym: I think that's not.

455
00:24:46,321 --> 00:24:48,610
Scott: it's not useful for normal people unless you're crazy.

456
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:56,690
Scott: However, the thing didn't have a demo though of a three screen setup, you know, you could do like a racing game Like you're really into racing games or when FPS is support that better.

457
00:24:56,931 --> 00:24:59,504
Rym: I'd have to see like how like older FPS is would handle that.

458
00:24:59,524 --> 00:25:09,848
Rym: because if I had you know The three for the peripheral vision, you know I was always big back in the quake days of playing with like the 120 fov and the like the fisheye Just so I could see around my back.

459
00:25:11,351 --> 00:25:12,416
Scott: That's pretty much the expo.

460
00:25:12,516 --> 00:25:15,710
Rym: Oh, there's the warioware DIY, which they didn't play for it.

461
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,675
Rym: People seem to really like it.

462
00:25:16,735 --> 00:25:25,410
Scott: Yeah, Nintendo had a tiny booth with warioware and Pokemon gold and silver which were ubiquitous at the con anyway, so whatever we didn't even bother to wait.

463
00:25:25,471 --> 00:25:26,525
Scott: We just said oh look warioware.

464
00:25:26,606 --> 00:25:28,407
Scott: Okay We'll see it one day.

465
00:25:29,412 --> 00:25:31,630
Rym: So, you know, what do you do with these kinds of mail all the badges?

466
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:37,102
Scott: I mean you just go get the badge if you don't have it already like, you know Cuz they don't mail out the panelist badges.

467
00:25:37,142 --> 00:25:38,390
Scott: They only mail out the attendee.

468
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,562
Rym: Yep, so we had to go pick up our badges as a result.

469
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:41,949
Rym: We didn't get a Charlie card.

470
00:25:42,412 --> 00:25:46,390
Rym: I just spent like money to get a Charlie ticket that cost more than a Charlie card, whatever.

471
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:53,890
Scott: But anyway, we did manage to get you know, the lanyards which are in the bags of goodies Which are just they're just sitting there and these big bins in the queue room and you just take them.

472
00:25:53,931 --> 00:25:54,700
Scott: You can take more than one.

473
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:55,348
Scott: They don't give a shit.

474
00:25:55,369 --> 00:25:58,950
Rym: now You might not think about it, especially, you know, a lot of PAX people don't go to like anime cons.

475
00:25:59,051 --> 00:26:06,768
Rym: But fan cons especially anime cons It used to be like the goodie bag would have crazy goodies in it like DVDs of stuff.

476
00:26:06,808 --> 00:26:09,259
Scott: the PAX West Goodie bag actually crazy stuff.

477
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:09,982
Scott: I mean it didn't.

478
00:26:10,364 --> 00:26:11,530
Scott: it's sort of crazy.

479
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:12,052
Scott: You know that.

480
00:26:12,092 --> 00:26:14,623
Scott: first of all, they were there's the little DS game with the pins.

481
00:26:14,884 --> 00:26:15,567
Scott: They didn't have that.

482
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:16,170
Scott: that was just yeah.

483
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,966
Rym: That was actually sorely lacking via distributed tournament system.

484
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:22,630
Scott: Yeah the DTS they didn't have.

485
00:26:23,031 --> 00:26:26,043
Scott: Like I remember at PAX West you would get they had a full case of.

486
00:26:26,143 --> 00:26:28,010
Scott: it was Lord of the Rings online the game.

487
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,178
Scott: It was a full game.

488
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,070
Scott: But of course it was a game of the subscription.

489
00:26:31,533 --> 00:26:32,841
Scott: No one was giving you a full game.

490
00:26:32,881 --> 00:26:34,310
Scott: that really for free.

491
00:26:34,471 --> 00:26:35,194
Rym: Maybe we should find out.

492
00:26:35,234 --> 00:26:37,826
Rym: we should put something awesome in those bags like pay to do it.

493
00:26:38,308 --> 00:26:38,710
Scott: Yeah, why not?

494
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,335
Scott: So here's what comes in the bag, right?

495
00:26:40,356 --> 00:26:43,750
Scott: So you get the program with the awesome art on it, of course, right?

496
00:26:44,071 --> 00:26:45,837
Scott: The program is you know, it's alright.

497
00:26:45,877 --> 00:26:49,990
Scott: it has all the information you need about tournaments and schedules and a map.

498
00:26:50,251 --> 00:26:51,902
Rym: It's got the same aesthetic as the PAX West.

499
00:26:52,002 --> 00:26:53,190
Rym: one is basically the PAX West.

500
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:57,210
Scott: It's got a description of every event, you know, and all these things got a lot of notes pages.

501
00:26:57,752 --> 00:27:03,111
Scott: The only thing with this is that they don't give you this is the only place you're gonna have the schedule that you can carry Around.

502
00:27:03,151 --> 00:27:05,359
Scott: they don't give you a separate pocket schedule.

503
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,734
Scott: So you have to carry this whole thing around to you and keep you know Referring to it.

504
00:27:10,177 --> 00:27:12,370
Scott: if you had a pocket schedule, you could just leave this in your room.

505
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:16,630
Rym: This is one of the few things where we think, you know, usually we say oh the anime cons could all learn from packs.

506
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,362
Rym: This is one situation where packs could learn from the anime cons.

507
00:27:19,664 --> 00:27:25,556
Rym: a one-page pocket schedule Would just be great and it wouldn't cost that much to stick it in the bag All right, maybe put an ad on it.

508
00:27:26,017 --> 00:27:27,904
Scott: So other than that you get a bunch of flyers.

509
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:31,719
Scott: Here's one for let's see Magic is a gathering.

510
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,010
Scott: Here's goozex.com, which is a website.

511
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:38,646
Scott: Oh, this is that sort of scam ish website where you you send you trade games and get points.

512
00:27:38,726 --> 00:27:42,320
Scott: you with the points you earn You can get games and they get a cut somehow.

513
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,268
Rym: We're basically giving free advertising to everyone who paid.

514
00:27:44,328 --> 00:27:44,650
Scott: I guess.

515
00:27:45,173 --> 00:27:50,580
Scott: Yeah, anyway play on whatever Flame on Dolby axon.

516
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,649
Scott: Okay, it's probably some audio gaming thing.

517
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,959
Scott: Cge classic gaming expo 2010.

518
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:57,164
Scott: Oh, where is this?

519
00:27:57,284 --> 00:27:58,630
Rym: Yeah, maybe we should go Vegas.

520
00:27:59,571 --> 00:28:01,001
Rym: Alright new egg was in the room.

521
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:02,370
Rym: Yeah new egg was in the house.

522
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:05,390
Scott: We actually talked to an Intel guy about some chips and stuff.

523
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:11,970
Rym: Yeah, we were asked him why the smallest ones like the ones you want on your like my home media PC don't have HDMI out.

524
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,377
Rym: He was like, yeah, I know it kind of sucks.

525
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:15,026
Rym: I think it technologists not there yet.

526
00:28:15,046 --> 00:28:17,940
Scott: Yeah These people are selling some computers.

527
00:28:18,241 --> 00:28:19,587
Scott: He explosion man that games.

528
00:28:19,627 --> 00:28:23,338
Scott: Alright, and Here's the only interesting things that were in the bag.

529
00:28:23,358 --> 00:28:34,330
Scott: Alright, so first of all, right you Got this Magic magic money the wasting magic the gathering and the thing is most of the time they give you like some boosters.

530
00:28:34,692 --> 00:28:36,802
Scott: You know, maybe they give you a booster.

531
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:39,478
Rym: what you throw away or give to a kid He's waiting to do with a booster.

532
00:28:39,538 --> 00:28:40,870
Rym: This is an entire day.

533
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:44,264
Scott: This is enough cards to play magic the gathering and not only that.

534
00:28:44,284 --> 00:28:45,830
Scott: it comes with the rules how to play.

535
00:28:46,131 --> 00:28:46,896
Rym: Oh, I gotta read those.

536
00:28:46,936 --> 00:28:48,665
Rym: cuz the last time I read him was revised.

537
00:28:48,766 --> 00:28:52,325
Scott: Yeah, and look at this Here is a full 40 card deck, right?

538
00:28:52,365 --> 00:28:53,149
Scott: It's all green.

539
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:58,707
Rym: They give you a 15 forests, you know, and then they give you any artifacts or just green.

540
00:28:58,888 --> 00:28:59,530
Scott: No, it's just green.

541
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:12,170
Scott: Right, they give you 15 and they give you a whole bunch of creatures and then like a handful of instances it's like if you play that Magic game that's on the Xbox is the same kind of deck that you're gonna find in that game.

542
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,976
Scott: You know a real simple straightforward deck.

543
00:29:14,478 --> 00:29:18,170
Rym: What was amazing is, you know walking around the con like before it opened just out.

544
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:25,832
Rym: Everyone's playing magic like people had magic out and they were playing these decks and a lot of these weren't people who brought magic cards With them.

545
00:29:25,872 --> 00:29:29,750
Scott: there's are people who just busted these decks out and played this magic that they got.

546
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:37,730
Rym: Multiple groups that I ran into were like two guys like us who had played magic in the past Teaching someone who had never played it how it worked with these decks.

547
00:29:38,112 --> 00:29:40,410
Scott: And the thing is I got the green one, right which is random.

548
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:54,670
Scott: I want if I would have could have chosen I would have chosen green but the I just picked it in video bag, you know, and this is the one that was in there and I could have gone through back to the bag bin and looted and gotten one of every different color.

549
00:29:54,771 --> 00:29:57,043
Scott: I think there were five different decks that were available.

550
00:29:57,445 --> 00:29:58,430
Scott: I think you got a different color.

551
00:29:58,611 --> 00:29:59,255
Rym: I didn't even look.

552
00:29:59,477 --> 00:30:00,181
Scott: you didn't look I don't know.

553
00:30:00,201 --> 00:30:01,207
Rym: I think Emily took my bag home.

554
00:30:01,268 --> 00:30:01,549
Rym: I don't know.

555
00:30:01,811 --> 00:30:05,681
Scott: Oh, whatever, but yeah full playable deck of magic cards.

556
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,206
Scott: That was a good call by them.

557
00:30:07,286 --> 00:30:08,710
Scott: Not that I support the playing of magic.

558
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:19,262
Scott: The final thing that was in the bag was this this very important card, which I have kept that the omega-thon card The omega-thon card big change at PAX East from PAX West.

559
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,068
Scott: I can see why they changed.

560
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:23,601
Scott: it Is that they used to.

561
00:30:23,742 --> 00:30:28,754
Scott: when you pre-reg for PAX West There'd be a box that you would check and say yes I want to be an omega.

562
00:30:28,774 --> 00:30:34,106
Scott: not the problem with this was that You know, they would call people up and say you wanna be omega.

563
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:34,810
Scott: not, you know.

564
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:39,750
Scott: You check the box and they would say oh no, you know, they couldn't get people to confirm.

565
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:43,244
Scott: It was a lot of work calling people on the phone such and such and such.

566
00:30:43,566 --> 00:30:44,670
Rym: I still can't understand that.

567
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:50,752
Rym: I mean if Mike and Jerry called me like hey, you're an omega not I would just been like People, you know?

568
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:53,038
Scott: not people had to prepare to be an omega.

569
00:30:53,058 --> 00:30:55,144
Scott: not they would train right and they.

570
00:30:55,285 --> 00:31:01,384
Scott: it was very inaccessible very difficult And people might not show up to the convention unreliable.

571
00:31:01,404 --> 00:31:02,709
Scott: It's a big pain in the ass.

572
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:08,730
Scott: So this way anyone who is applying to be an omega not does so at the con, you know, they're there.

573
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:13,585
Rym: But even then so they passed him out, you know You you toss these in as you walked into.

574
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:14,550
Scott: that was a problem.

575
00:31:14,631 --> 00:31:16,749
Scott: Is that you toss them in the bag as you go to the keynote?

576
00:31:17,412 --> 00:31:22,089
Scott: So the the entrance to the keynote was slowed down by people tossing cards in the back.

577
00:31:22,109 --> 00:31:22,510
Rym: It was great.

578
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:24,433
Rym: We get there, you know, basically, you know We got in early.

579
00:31:24,474 --> 00:31:36,950
Rym: as we wander around and then we hear this noise And we were standing like in the front of where the main events are gonna be and we see the line Being led in by all these enforcers walking backwards like holding them barely at bay.

580
00:31:37,219 --> 00:31:37,449
Rym: Yeah.

581
00:31:37,671 --> 00:31:46,301
Rym: And then we see this one enforcer with this little basket to catch the omega-thon cards and he looks around like oh shit Robert coo actually came over with a big bin.

582
00:31:46,341 --> 00:31:47,507
Rym: He's like, alright, I got this.

583
00:31:47,668 --> 00:31:55,369
Scott: Yeah But you know The point was is that this is a better system in all ways except for the fact that they had to slow down that.

584
00:31:55,409 --> 00:31:56,613
Rym: and no But here's the amazing part.

585
00:31:56,673 --> 00:32:01,249
Rym: So people took these filled them out and put them in as they walked in.

586
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:05,847
Scott: and Then what about people who didn't go to the King, you know, well, you gotta want it.

587
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:07,254
Rym: I mean, it's the omega-thon You gotta want it.

588
00:32:07,295 --> 00:32:08,623
Rym: They can't just make it really easy.

589
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:09,750
Rym: You've got to want it in some way.

590
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:13,810
Scott: I mean if you the pigeons not get just jumping into your I think it would have been better to do it the same way.

591
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:18,870
Scott: That like baseball stadiums have the all-star voting that she just had bins about that were omega-thon.

592
00:32:19,052 --> 00:32:22,578
Rym: I know cuz look even There's the point I was gonna do even with you.

593
00:32:22,618 --> 00:32:25,690
Rym: turn them in as you walk into the event where they will announce them.

594
00:32:26,051 --> 00:32:28,699
Rym: They had like six people who were called up not be there.

595
00:32:28,719 --> 00:32:31,388
Rym: Remember they recalled they called up the alts.

596
00:32:31,969 --> 00:32:33,418
Rym: Yep I don't know what was up with that.

597
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:34,606
Scott: I don't know what's up with that either.

598
00:32:34,626 --> 00:32:37,424
Scott: It doesn't matter They got the people they needed.

599
00:32:37,444 --> 00:32:38,410
Scott: the omega-thon happened.

600
00:32:38,752 --> 00:32:41,309
Rym: I like the fact that it was all co-op all the way through.

601
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:42,615
Rym: I think that was a really.

602
00:32:42,635 --> 00:32:45,910
Rym: it gave the omega-thon at PAX East a totally different style.

603
00:32:46,071 --> 00:32:47,538
Scott: Yeah, the thing was I felt it was.

604
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:50,879
Scott: while it was a different style and the co-op was awesome It was less epic.

605
00:32:51,142 --> 00:32:51,788
Rym: It was dated.

606
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:55,480
Scott: They did one omega-thon round on its own as an event.

607
00:32:55,661 --> 00:32:58,910
Scott: omega-thon round two was before the concerts on Friday.

608
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:03,772
Scott: Round three was before the concerts on Saturday and the final round was the closing ceremony I want.

609
00:33:03,853 --> 00:33:05,342
Rym: it was good that there was one.

610
00:33:05,362 --> 00:33:06,489
Scott: there was one less round.

611
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:10,064
Rym: Yeah usually five round but it was good that they put them before these big events like you.

612
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:12,153
Rym: go to the concert and You see the omega-thon.

613
00:33:12,193 --> 00:33:13,880
Rym: They didn't take up panel room space.

614
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,506
Rym: They weren't like out and about.

615
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:16,610
Scott: it was also less epic.

616
00:33:16,932 --> 00:33:19,450
Scott: It wasn't like this thing that was going on that you would follow.

617
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:29,488
Rym: They didn't have the big board with all the people's faces and they would cross them out, you know I think my guess I didn't actually ask you because notice how they didn't say anything about the omega-thon for a long time and then Suddenly they busted out.

618
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:42,781
Rym: My guess is they were planning on not doing an omega-thon the first year and just you know Making sure the con happened and then when they realized that it was gonna easily be bigger than PAX OS Like it is going to be as I go said the real packs.

619
00:33:42,982 --> 00:33:44,366
Rym: Yeah, they were like, ah shit.

620
00:33:44,407 --> 00:33:45,350
Rym: We gotta have an omega-thon.

621
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:46,372
Scott: Yep so they did it.

622
00:33:46,653 --> 00:33:47,717
Rym: either that or not.

623
00:33:47,978 --> 00:33:55,847
Rym: once we now that we know what the final round was because while the other three rounds were Kind of met the final round was I would say the most epic final round they've ever had.

624
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,513
Rym: like that was crazy I don't know.

625
00:33:57,573 --> 00:34:00,303
Scott: I think that the versus excite bike was the most epic round.

626
00:34:01,226 --> 00:34:02,915
Scott: I'm sure plus there were rounds We haven't seen.

627
00:34:02,935 --> 00:34:04,123
Rym: well final round.

628
00:34:04,204 --> 00:34:04,969
Rym: I mean the ones before.

629
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:05,469
Rym: that I don't know.

630
00:34:06,231 --> 00:34:10,047
Rym: The excite bike one definitely was awesome and I see a lot of people talking about it.

631
00:34:10,831 --> 00:34:11,777
Rym: I guess only time will tell.

632
00:34:11,818 --> 00:34:13,568
Rym: maybe they were equally epic in different ways.

633
00:34:13,628 --> 00:34:24,889
Rym: Maybe alright, so So the keynote, you know, we all file in it's standing room only Originally, they weren't letting people go out to pee and I gotta tell you I really had to pee.

634
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:28,940
Scott: I actually walked out in the middle of Will's keynote And I soon and you wouldn't be able to get back in.

635
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,909
Rym: Yes, but then as I walked out there's an enforcer.

636
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:33,339
Rym: I was like, dude, I'm a special guest.

637
00:34:33,922 --> 00:34:38,668
Rym: I got a pee and he's like, I'll let you back in Mmm, and he totally let me back in and I got back.

638
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:41,455
Rym: But we'll eat and you know, well, we'll.

639
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,882
Rym: wheaten to pronounce it correctly gave the keynote.

640
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:45,607
Rym: He's given a packs keynote before.

641
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:49,396
Rym: I'm curious Specifically like on the inside why they picked.

642
00:34:49,436 --> 00:34:53,550
Rym: well because it at least from the way he told it they kind of threw this at him.

643
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:54,882
Rym: He was like, I don't know if I want to do it.

644
00:34:54,922 --> 00:34:55,549
Rym: Okay, I'll do it.

645
00:34:56,813 --> 00:35:00,778
Rym: so I wonder if it was because Maybe they couldn't get anyone in time.

646
00:35:00,878 --> 00:35:06,882
Rym: Maybe like I don't know what the planning process was actually for paxies, but He gave a good keynote in the end though.

647
00:35:07,002 --> 00:35:07,665
Scott: It was okay.

648
00:35:07,726 --> 00:35:08,650
Scott: It wasn't epic though.

649
00:35:08,751 --> 00:35:09,354
Scott: It wasn't like.

650
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:11,766
Scott: oh man, that was the greatest, you know, it was just.

651
00:35:11,846 --> 00:35:12,630
Scott: it was no cakey, you know.

652
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:12,931
Scott: It was.

653
00:35:13,193 --> 00:35:19,259
Rym: I'll admit it was kind of a letdown from the last two packs keynotes We saw because those were just one there.

654
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,243
Rym: They had like slides.

655
00:35:20,283 --> 00:35:22,170
Rym: They were much more kind of professionally delivered.

656
00:35:22,674 --> 00:35:24,369
Rym: There was much less woo game going on.

657
00:35:24,894 --> 00:35:34,178
Rym: Well, I love you All right But you played the woo game the game that we've done everything in our power to crush Since we started doing panels.

658
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,109
Rym: your that whole part of your speech was basically Final Fantasy and the crowd goes.

659
00:35:41,411 --> 00:35:43,409
Rym: You were just tricking the crowd into saying woo.

660
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:48,370
Rym: You were taking social currency and throwing it at them and then getting that to reflect back on you.

661
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,237
Rym: And I used to do that at panels.

662
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:50,920
Rym: I don't anymore.

663
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,502
Rym: I know better.

664
00:35:51,884 --> 00:35:52,165
Scott: Yes.

665
00:35:52,225 --> 00:35:53,430
Scott: Do not play the woo game.

666
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:56,849
Scott: It was very disappointing to see the woo game played at the keynote of all places.

667
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,590
Scott: Yeah, I got understand like a small lowbrow panel playing the woo game.

668
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:02,970
Rym: I guess it's just the last two keynotes that PAX West.

669
00:36:03,532 --> 00:36:11,626
Rym: I was like deeply inspired by them because they were all kind of the same story of like a narrative of Why gaming is important like not just why it's important to us as gamers.

670
00:36:11,646 --> 00:36:12,310
Rym: That's a big part of it.

671
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:18,230
Rym: But really like gaming is important in ways beyond everything in this room and they were really inspired.

672
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:22,226
Rym: I remember being moved almost to tears tears in a row just like feeling like this is it?

673
00:36:22,386 --> 00:36:35,080
Rym: and that feeling After I remembered oh, yeah I'm here to play some games but But definitely like you felt that like that catch in the heart of like gaming matters and we're on the cusp of gaming becoming You know the great the next great media after writing.

674
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:39,277
Scott: Yeah, and well we tried to say gaming man He did.

675
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:45,489
Rym: he said that he said it really well But then he got it kept going with the woo game for a while and then he did that whole.

676
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:54,810
Rym: you know spoil some games for people bid and I feel like His keynote should have been shorter and just done the inspiring part or he should have had more inspiring things to say.

677
00:36:55,191 --> 00:36:56,397
Rym: Yeah, it was a good keynote.

678
00:36:56,437 --> 00:36:57,020
Rym: Don't get us wrong.

679
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,562
Rym: It was good.

680
00:36:57,602 --> 00:36:58,185
Rym: It was solid.

681
00:36:58,426 --> 00:36:59,209
Rym: people really liked it.

682
00:36:59,631 --> 00:37:03,485
Rym: It's just I'm comparing it to the two keynotes prior that I think were better.

683
00:37:03,746 --> 00:37:06,412
Scott: Yeah, anyway Let's see.

684
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:07,337
Scott: What else was going to?

685
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:09,346
Scott: Oh immediately following the keynote, right?

686
00:37:09,426 --> 00:37:10,350
Scott: I attempted my vision.

687
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:14,242
Rym: So we had a vision right and the vision was you know gave in taiko.

688
00:37:14,262 --> 00:37:19,499
Rym: they come out every year and they play that song Every day, I'm hustling every day.

689
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:23,412
Rym: I'm hustling right so they Play.

690
00:37:23,452 --> 00:37:32,566
Scott: vision was to have the entire keynote and main events singing the song Before the song played and then singing with the song and then they would come out and it'd be epic.

691
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:32,828
Scott: and

692
00:37:32,848 --> 00:37:45,969
Rym: we learned how to Do this like we've tried this sort of thing a long time ago when we were young and stupid at Otakon and it failed Miserably, but then no years of experience and a college humor video of a lone dancing nut job causes a movement of how to make a movement in a crowd.

693
00:37:46,471 --> 00:37:53,173
Rym: so we just took that exact method and we planned it and we had people around who were waiting for the queue and Scott was gonna start.

694
00:37:53,254 --> 00:37:54,317
Scott: I was worried right.

695
00:37:54,337 --> 00:38:05,266
Scott: I was worried because I was you know during the time in between the end of the keynote in the beginning of the Q&A They might have Right played some music or something and I would have to overpower this music with the vision

696
00:38:05,486 --> 00:38:11,590
Rym: or it might have been a long Wait, like what if they attend kill difficulties like Pax is known for and you know you started and then there's a half hour.

697
00:38:12,393 --> 00:38:16,730
Scott: It's not gonna be able to keep me going for a half hour or it'll become the most epic thing ever like Bohemian Rhapsody.

698
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:17,730
Rym: But that will talk about that.

699
00:38:18,532 --> 00:38:23,186
Scott: The thing is the worst case scenario happened immediately as the keynote applause ended.

700
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,530
Scott: They started playing the song.

701
00:38:25,292 --> 00:38:27,538
Scott: So what was I supposed to do?

702
00:38:27,598 --> 00:38:28,961
Scott: but vision was a failure?

703
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:30,646
Rym: I'm sad, but I'm also glad.

704
00:38:30,686 --> 00:38:32,290
Rym: I'm sad because the vision failed.

705
00:38:32,673 --> 00:38:37,730
Rym: It's always sad when a vision dies But I'm glad because there was zero technical failure.

706
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:41,347
Rym: It was the perfect most professional transition from keynote Q&A.

707
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:46,810
Rym: Yep, now the Q&A at PAX is special and we're trying to know a bunch of our friends weren't gonna go.

708
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,880
Rym: They're like, I don't want to see some Q&A people.

709
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,317
Scott: always there's no reason they go to the second Q&A But you gotta go to the first one.

710
00:38:52,337 --> 00:38:53,685
Rym: I don't know if I missed the first one.

711
00:38:53,745 --> 00:38:55,154
Rym: I would go to the second one That's right.

712
00:38:55,194 --> 00:38:57,510
Scott: Yeah, that'd be true if they scheduled a panel during the first one.

713
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,505
Rym: Plus, you know funny things happen at the second one.

714
00:38:59,525 --> 00:39:01,990
Rym: Like it's a good deal It's more, you know, what do you care about at the con?

715
00:39:02,712 --> 00:39:08,090
Rym: We had to you know, remind everyone that the Q&A at PAX is not just fanboys asking stupid questions.

716
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:10,262
Rym: It's people usually asking good questions.

717
00:39:10,283 --> 00:39:16,210
Rym: Like I'd say there's a 60 to 70 percent hit rate of good questions versus fanboy.

718
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,575
Scott: It's not just questions.

719
00:39:17,656 --> 00:39:24,062
Scott: either people get up and do stuff or will announce things You know like at the last PAX Prime those guys brought a cardboard cutout.

720
00:39:24,122 --> 00:39:26,654
Rym: other friend who couldn't come and they're like Can we do it again?

721
00:39:26,814 --> 00:39:31,592
Scott: dude in front of me in line called his friend who couldn't make it on the phone and everyone Yells.

722
00:39:31,632 --> 00:39:34,140
Scott: so it was someone's birthday and we all said happy birthday.

723
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:34,902
Scott: asshole.

724
00:39:35,023 --> 00:39:39,890
Rym: at the second Q&A like someone or it was one of the Other events someone was like, will you play Thunderstone with me?

725
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:44,992
Rym: This game is up you guys's alley and then they you know from the Q&A They organized.

726
00:39:45,013 --> 00:39:51,597
Rym: so the people on stage and this guy and someone else in the audience at another microphone about to ask a question All scheduled a game of Thunderstone.

727
00:39:51,617 --> 00:39:52,842
Rym: then they all met and they played it.

728
00:39:53,063 --> 00:39:56,960
Rym: Yeah, it's kind of a. it's like this Give-and-take like the knuckle crack happens.

729
00:39:57,302 --> 00:40:00,151
Scott: Yeah, the knuckle crack very important Tradition.

730
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:01,817
Rym: no one Rick rolled the audience.

731
00:40:02,078 --> 00:40:03,704
Rym: No, no one Rick roll surprised.

732
00:40:04,006 --> 00:40:04,266
Scott: Yeah.

733
00:40:04,648 --> 00:40:06,995
Rym: No, but I Pulled off some epic.

734
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:08,021
Scott: It wasn't that epic.

735
00:40:08,121 --> 00:40:08,664
Rym: It was epic.

736
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,810
Scott: Look at how epic was it?

737
00:40:09,971 --> 00:40:16,330
Rym: It was epic in the sense that you know, we got it up online and the first planned it Well in advance, it wasn't like some improvisational genius.

738
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:21,095
Rym: The thing is we planned it so far ahead, but you know this sort of thing There's such a fine line between.

739
00:40:21,476 --> 00:40:22,258
Rym: that is awesome.

740
00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:23,322
Rym: And you're a douchebag.

741
00:40:23,342 --> 00:40:29,502
Scott: Yeah, like the line is so narrow So basically we're doing this action castle panel and I said, you know what right?

742
00:40:29,623 --> 00:40:33,290
Scott: I told Jared the creator of action castle Look, you should go to the Q&A you mean?

743
00:40:33,993 --> 00:40:35,593
Rym: action Castle.

744
00:40:36,094 --> 00:40:47,054
Scott: I told them look you can go to the Q&A go up and as your question just stand up and say welcome to action castle And start playing it and then after a few minutes or whatever after your time is up You know.

745
00:40:47,094 --> 00:40:49,549
Scott: basically don't stand there forever Just say you know.

746
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,700
Scott: This concludes the trial version of action castle.

747
00:40:52,721 --> 00:40:56,374
Scott: to play the full version come to the Wyvern theater on Sunday 30.

748
00:40:56,374 --> 00:41:00,793
Rym: Scott tried to convince him like four times to do this and at PAX the last moment He's like, will you do it?

749
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:01,355
Rym: and Jared's like.

750
00:41:01,797 --> 00:41:03,082
Rym: basically Jared said Scott.

751
00:41:03,243 --> 00:41:04,086
Rym: I'm in fact a wuss.

752
00:41:04,266 --> 00:41:07,170
Rym: I'm not going to do this I'm going to be a total wuss and fam.

753
00:41:07,311 --> 00:41:08,539
Scott: So I said do you want me to do it?

754
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:10,170
Scott: and he was like, it would be awesome if you did it.

755
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:10,833
Scott: So I did it.

756
00:41:11,214 --> 00:41:13,464
Rym: so, you know, we're sitting there and Scott lines up and he goes.

757
00:41:13,826 --> 00:41:18,100
Rym: you can see the YouTube video But the crowd went fucking nuts.

758
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,688
Scott: people seem to really like it far more than I expect.

759
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:22,013
Rym: well taiko It's funny cuz.

760
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:22,777
Rym: taiko got it.

761
00:41:22,878 --> 00:41:23,722
Scott: I knew he would get it.

762
00:41:23,822 --> 00:41:25,310
Scott: I knew that Mike wouldn't get it at all.

763
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:25,832
Rym: He's Mike.

764
00:41:26,254 --> 00:41:28,424
Rym: I think he got it at least enough.

765
00:41:28,485 --> 00:41:29,650
Rym: He was more playing to the crowd.

766
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:30,457
Rym: I mean his whole.

767
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:31,930
Rym: what the fuck do you want from me?

768
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:38,348
Rym: That was good for the vibe of the whole thing I guess but it went on the perfect amount of time like the crowd was losing it when he's like.

769
00:41:38,388 --> 00:41:39,231
Rym: what the fuck do you Want from me?

770
00:41:39,332 --> 00:41:41,178
Rym: like I don't know how to what the fuck?

771
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:51,089
Rym: the crowd just like the microphone on my camera was like busted By how loud everybody was and just at the moment when it was about to go on too long It was gonna move from awesome to douchebag.

772
00:41:51,973 --> 00:41:52,274
Rym: He did.

773
00:41:52,334 --> 00:41:54,783
Rym: Mike is like what can you say to end this?

774
00:41:54,903 --> 00:41:56,930
Scott: and then he's like say whatever will make him stop.

775
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,293
Scott: He's like quit.

776
00:41:59,996 --> 00:42:00,518
Rym: and then you did.

777
00:42:00,758 --> 00:42:01,601
Rym: it was so epic.

778
00:42:01,722 --> 00:42:04,110
Rym: I was so happy about that and it was on joystick.

779
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:08,026
Rym: So yeah, very action castle and you know people lined up.

780
00:42:08,447 --> 00:42:12,999
Scott: Yep So I guess that about wraps up that morning, right?

781
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:13,240
Scott: Yeah.

782
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,264
Scott: All right.

783
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:15,427
Rym: Let's leave it recording.

784
00:42:15,447 --> 00:42:16,130
Rym: Let's do another thing.

785
00:42:16,491 --> 00:42:18,259
Scott: Let's do the tabletop area.

786
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,408
Scott: Yeah, go through all the games you were playing.

787
00:42:20,428 --> 00:42:20,749
Scott: All right.

788
00:42:22,712 --> 00:42:30,503
Rym: So as we were want to do at PAX is we spend a lot of time in tabletop because it's quiet For we can play some games that we like to play with sit down.

789
00:42:30,623 --> 00:42:30,924
Rym: Yep.

790
00:42:31,085 --> 00:42:31,466
Scott: It's all.

791
00:42:31,506 --> 00:42:32,449
Scott: it's a hot place to be.

792
00:42:32,791 --> 00:42:37,130
Rym: Yeah, it's one of my favorite parts of packs other than the concerts the Q&A and the keynote.

793
00:42:37,732 --> 00:42:38,917
Scott: So we played a bunch of games.

794
00:42:39,078 --> 00:42:42,150
Scott: so we go over there and I checked out this game Bacchus banquet.

795
00:42:42,512 --> 00:42:50,628
Scott: But I didn't get to play it because I ended up teaching some awesome The listener rising through the ranks chase Gordon and his friends how to play.

796
00:42:50,648 --> 00:42:51,050
Rym: he's Gordon.

797
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:57,010
Scott: You're like one of my favorite fans at this point Yeah, so I taught him and his friends how to play and then I got roped into actually playing.

798
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,757
Scott: It's a Rym played Bacchus banquet.

799
00:42:58,797 --> 00:42:58,958
Rym: Yep.

800
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,203
Scott: Tell us about Bacchus back.

801
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:01,750
Rym: So Bacchus bankruptcy way back.

802
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,876
Scott: We picked it up based on the theme alone.

803
00:43:03,896 --> 00:43:08,670
Rym: We bought another game that the cover is basically bohemian bot not bohemian bot.

804
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:17,990
Rym: That's the movie that Emily's freedomism by is a bot And the theme of that game is you're all Roman nobles trying to get all your shit together.

805
00:43:18,251 --> 00:43:22,470
Rym: Get the fuck out of Rome before the Visigoth comes and kills you and you got to get to Carthage.

806
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:23,012
Scott: You're it safe.

807
00:43:23,193 --> 00:43:30,419
Rym: The cover is this this guy all fat with wine and women going great And in the background Rome is burning.

808
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,126
Rym: Yep, like over the ocean.

809
00:43:32,207 --> 00:43:32,970
Rym: It's so beautiful.

810
00:43:33,471 --> 00:43:35,638
Rym: So that game was not actually that good.

811
00:43:35,658 --> 00:43:37,183
Rym: This game is much better.

812
00:43:37,263 --> 00:43:39,650
Rym: Bacchus banquet the glory and gluttony of Rome.

813
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:44,630
Rym: So everybody plays as up like a character from the Caligula era.

814
00:43:45,031 --> 00:43:49,906
Rym: Awesome, and everyone has a secret role, but one person plays openly as Caligula.

815
00:43:50,006 --> 00:43:51,330
Scott: Can I be Caligula's horse?

816
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,513
Rym: So let me tell you what.

817
00:43:52,914 --> 00:43:53,596
Rym: Caligula.

818
00:43:53,957 --> 00:44:02,723
Rym: the the graphic on the card, you know your identity card like Octavius or whatever Caligula's card is one of the funniest goddamn things I've ever seen.

819
00:44:02,763 --> 00:44:11,790
Rym: like you look at this thing and you cannot help but laugh all right, so Caligula plays openly everyone else plays secretly and It's kind of a every round, you know?

820
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:18,587
Rym: You put seven cards up and some of them are like a dish and some of them are wine and some of them are poison and stuff like this.

821
00:44:18,607 --> 00:44:26,422
Rym: and You're you have a score that is your belt buckle Yeah, and if it great you keep having to widen it the more you eat and drink.

822
00:44:26,863 --> 00:44:28,268
Rym: if it goes above ten you die.

823
00:44:29,831 --> 00:44:33,110
Rym: So poison just fills your belt buckle like nine points.

824
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:35,850
Scott: Oh, so you gotta have zero to and you can handle the poison.

825
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:42,168
Rym: Yeah, and some things can make it go down like having sex Or taking a nap.

826
00:44:43,531 --> 00:44:43,912
Rym: And it's this.

827
00:44:43,933 --> 00:44:44,414
Rym: dinner parties.

828
00:44:44,454 --> 00:44:49,330
Rym: every round one player whoever's the active player picks three cards openly from the table.

829
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:52,600
Rym: So maybe a poison a day and the dishes to like the.

830
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,131
Rym: you have goals like one player will win if he eats just eight Dishes.

831
00:44:56,272 --> 00:44:57,034
Rym: that's all he wants.

832
00:44:57,416 --> 00:45:01,330
Rym: one player want one card wants like three points of wine and four dishes.

833
00:45:01,853 --> 00:45:03,263
Rym: Caligula has these different.

834
00:45:03,384 --> 00:45:04,190
Rym: everyone wants different stuff.

835
00:45:04,812 --> 00:45:09,110
Rym: But some of the dishes are like a lobster belt one and it counts as one dish.

836
00:45:09,671 --> 00:45:16,910
Rym: One of the dishes is an entire deer and it's just a plate with this deer like laying on it and it's five points.

837
00:45:18,131 --> 00:45:22,608
Scott: So widens your belt buckle by half the way, but it only counts as one dish, but half kills you.

838
00:45:22,709 --> 00:45:25,941
Scott: Yeah Yeah, so so that's a bad one to get depending.

839
00:45:26,001 --> 00:45:28,430
Rym: so you pick the three and then you shuffle them up.

840
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:30,438
Rym: You put one face down on your sheet.

841
00:45:30,638 --> 00:45:34,914
Rym: You're saying I will eat this one On my turn.

842
00:45:35,395 --> 00:45:36,078
Rym: then you take one.

843
00:45:36,098 --> 00:45:37,382
Rym: you say I'm discarding this one.

844
00:45:37,642 --> 00:45:39,950
Rym: you take one and offer it to another player as a gift.

845
00:45:40,852 --> 00:45:43,190
Rym: They can choose to either eat it right then flip it over.

846
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:46,545
Scott: So they have a one in three chance of knowing what it is basically.

847
00:45:46,565 --> 00:45:47,670
Scott: they know it's one of those three.

848
00:45:48,021 --> 00:45:53,769
Rym: Yes so they can either flip it over and apply it to themselves immediately or gift it to someone else who hasn't had it yet.

849
00:45:53,789 --> 00:45:59,049
Rym: if Everyone regifts whoever was the active player has to eat it.

850
00:46:00,972 --> 00:46:04,154
Scott: But so you want to To become.

851
00:46:04,174 --> 00:46:08,450
Rym: there's only one way to become the active player and that is to accept a gift and not die.

852
00:46:09,992 --> 00:46:16,102
Rym: and the only other part of the game really is that Everyone has a special ability like a card you draw randomly.

853
00:46:16,322 --> 00:46:18,570
Rym: You can use it once in the entire game.

854
00:46:18,872 --> 00:46:20,062
Rym: you just flip it over and use it.

855
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:30,729
Rym: and there are things like take the card that the active player was gonna keep and use it on yourself or Take a card that was gifted to you and force whoever gifted it to you to eat it right there.

856
00:46:31,811 --> 00:46:34,882
Rym: If you die, you just you throw away your card.

857
00:46:34,902 --> 00:46:35,284
Rym: you died.

858
00:46:35,304 --> 00:46:36,789
Rym: you draw another player card and keep going.

859
00:46:37,354 --> 00:46:39,515
Rym: Oh whoever makes their goal You can still win.

860
00:46:39,535 --> 00:46:42,590
Scott: like if you get close to your goal people are gonna attack you you're gonna die.

861
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:46,210
Scott: You're gonna get sent back to zero, but everyone might get sent back to zero.

862
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:48,610
Scott: So being close to winning isn't necessarily close to winning.

863
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:52,344
Rym: Yeah, you can get killed and everyone is secret except Caligula plays openly.

864
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:53,849
Rym: so you can try to you know.

865
00:46:54,151 --> 00:46:55,195
Rym: Con people into.

866
00:46:55,477 --> 00:46:58,430
Scott: so what if Caligula dies, so if Caligula soap, here's the deal.

867
00:46:58,912 --> 00:47:02,030
Rym: There are two women to those roles and all they want is a bunch of gifts.

868
00:47:02,712 --> 00:47:07,930
Rym: There's like three old men and two other women and they just want to eat and drink in different quantities of food and wine.

869
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:14,210
Rym: Caligula wants to eat some and drink a whole bunch or if any three people die he wins.

870
00:47:15,471 --> 00:47:23,725
Rym: Then there are the three conspirators if Caligula dies or if there are three daggers Which is one of the gifts in play at the same time.

871
00:47:24,187 --> 00:47:28,425
Rym: They all win Mmm, so they're trying to get the daggers in play or feed man.

872
00:47:28,465 --> 00:47:29,570
Scott: That would have helped Rome a lot.

873
00:47:31,911 --> 00:47:35,733
Rym: No, Caligula, okay, but it's basically Citadels.

874
00:47:35,934 --> 00:47:39,570
Rym: it is not a good game from game theory, you know our beyond candyland panel.

875
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:40,193
Rym: It is just.

876
00:47:40,675 --> 00:47:41,157
Scott: but would you.

877
00:47:41,218 --> 00:47:43,850
Scott: would you play instead of all my girls or would you pick citadel?

878
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:45,924
Rym: They're both important because they're a party game.

879
00:47:45,945 --> 00:47:46,630
Rym: They're really fun.

880
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:55,478
Rym: They're the who poison the cup game and you can if you get into it in roleplay and It's citadels without the building part of the game.

881
00:47:55,558 --> 00:47:58,730
Rym: It's just the poison in the cup, you know second-guessing.

882
00:47:58,831 --> 00:47:59,535
Scott: So would you play?

883
00:47:59,555 --> 00:48:00,038
Scott: would you picks?

884
00:48:00,139 --> 00:48:02,572
Scott: if you're sitting there and citadels and Bacchus Bank Which one did you pick?

885
00:48:02,653 --> 00:48:07,510
Rym: I would play Bacchus bank you it with because the building part is not super fun in citadels.

886
00:48:07,771 --> 00:48:10,425
Rym: All right, however, citadels, you know can have six or seven people.

887
00:48:10,485 --> 00:48:11,310
Rym: Bacchus banquet goes up.

888
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:12,187
Rym: I think it's three to five.

889
00:48:12,732 --> 00:48:13,776
Scott: So I played ticket to ride.

890
00:48:13,796 --> 00:48:17,270
Scott: like I said and I remembered that game pretty much comes down to what routes you draw.

891
00:48:17,591 --> 00:48:19,678
Scott: Yeah, and the rest is pretty obvious what to do.

892
00:48:19,799 --> 00:48:37,128
Scott: and it just comes and if there's if two people have pretty equal routes It comes down to like luck of drawing more routes Which is sort of mitigated by the fact that you draw three and you only have to keep one at most yeah, and at least but you can keep all three and You know the colors of the cars, you know, you might get lucky like oh you need a yellow route.

893
00:48:37,169 --> 00:48:38,153
Scott: so bad It could just be yelling.

894
00:48:38,174 --> 00:48:38,375
Scott: Yell.

895
00:48:38,395 --> 00:48:38,616
Scott: Yell.

896
00:48:38,656 --> 00:48:38,857
Scott: Yell.

897
00:48:38,877 --> 00:48:39,179
Scott: Yell.

898
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:40,103
Scott: Oh, maybe it happens.

899
00:48:40,264 --> 00:48:41,470
Rym: Yeah, it's still fun though.

900
00:48:41,651 --> 00:48:46,330
Scott: Yeah, it's still a fun game, but it's not a great quality, you know skilled game.

901
00:48:46,631 --> 00:48:50,567
Rym: We saw some other listeners right next to us during all this playing learning how to play and then playing Agricola.

902
00:48:50,808 --> 00:48:52,676
Rym: That's good I'm so I gotta play some more Agricola.

903
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:53,439
Rym: I really like that game.

904
00:48:53,459 --> 00:48:54,262
Scott: Yeah, definitely.

905
00:48:54,282 --> 00:48:55,527
Scott: We want to get the expansion.

906
00:48:55,547 --> 00:48:57,876
Rym: So we played Stone Age vs.

907
00:48:58,016 --> 00:48:58,739
Rym: Future Tech.

908
00:48:59,020 --> 00:48:59,361
Scott: Yeah, okay.

909
00:48:59,402 --> 00:49:01,610
Scott: Well, it's called time streams, right?

910
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:08,857
Scott: This is a versus non collectible card game that was supposed to play like a collectible card game From the look of it.

911
00:49:08,938 --> 00:49:10,165
Rym: Anyway, Scott pulls this out.

912
00:49:10,185 --> 00:49:17,889
Scott: He's written the rules I'm flipping through the cards and I've got the future to get tech and he has the caveman tech and I'm like, alright Well, how the hell do we play this game?

913
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,801
Scott: The rules are written so poorly and independently.

914
00:49:20,881 --> 00:49:23,010
Rym: the game itself is actually a cool concept.

915
00:49:23,411 --> 00:49:31,258
Rym: You build kind of this board of like days like you build it out and there's actions and then you go through the whole thing Again, kind of playing out the actions.

916
00:49:31,339 --> 00:49:36,907
Scott: Yeah, so imagine if you have a bunch of cards, you know It's normally a magic card right as a for a Dominion card is text on it.

917
00:49:36,927 --> 00:49:42,690
Scott: Yeah, right Imagine if the cards had two texts or some of them had one text and some of them had the other texts.

918
00:49:43,212 --> 00:49:54,090
Scott: So there's the play action which happens when you add the card to the game and there's the score action Which happens after you're done with the whole playing of every card and you just go through scoring everything.

919
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:55,195
Scott: They all do something different.

920
00:49:55,215 --> 00:49:58,068
Rym: So you build a machine and then the machine runs.

921
00:49:59,032 --> 00:50:01,302
Scott: Yeah, and while you're building the machine you do funky stuff.

922
00:50:01,382 --> 00:50:05,123
Rym: Also now that mechanic is awesome I think we should make a game like that some sort of like.

923
00:50:05,365 --> 00:50:06,210
Rym: I want to be good.

924
00:50:06,431 --> 00:50:07,634
Scott: Good fundamental idea.

925
00:50:07,734 --> 00:50:14,894
Scott: the game itself terrible that the words on the cards poorly written the rules poorly written the game of repeat cards Too like it was just.

926
00:50:14,934 --> 00:50:17,866
Scott: yeah, the game didn't really have a lot of strategy or anything.

927
00:50:17,886 --> 00:50:18,770
Scott: The art was good though.

928
00:50:18,911 --> 00:50:20,980
Scott: The art was nice, but the game very bad.

929
00:50:21,121 --> 00:50:22,990
Rym: mainly the theme had nothing to do with the game.

930
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:23,693
Rym: The theme was just.

931
00:50:23,834 --> 00:50:26,285
Rym: it was tacked on to the degree that it was not even there.

932
00:50:26,305 --> 00:50:32,622
Scott: Yep Stops also in the tabletop area right a guy we know from New York.

933
00:50:32,722 --> 00:50:35,370
Scott: right good friends sort of I guess where you know.

934
00:50:35,531 --> 00:50:38,130
Scott: He's in the nerd the nerd NYC sort of group, right?

935
00:50:38,791 --> 00:50:43,149
Scott: He has a game called super gachapon fighter and I told him I would bring some gachapon's which I forgot to do.

936
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:48,652
Scott: Yeah, but basically this ring my house name Iku if you're a hero clicks kind of fan, you know You're right.

937
00:50:48,973 --> 00:50:51,379
Scott: forget that just get super gachapon fighter with this.

938
00:50:51,419 --> 00:50:53,264
Scott: lets you do is you get?

939
00:50:53,444 --> 00:51:01,490
Scott: you know, your little PVC toy figures Right your little transformer guys, whatever it is, maybe whatever it is little street fighters little GI Joes.

940
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:09,063
Scott: Maybe you know some anime characters whatever you got, you know You bring it to the table at a Red Bull is now my leading guy.

941
00:51:09,104 --> 00:51:10,770
Scott: can a Red Bull sure go for it?

942
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:11,854
Scott: Right you both.

943
00:51:11,894 --> 00:51:15,829
Scott: you can roll up a character for whatever thing it is, you know, it's a point.

944
00:51:15,889 --> 00:51:16,150
Scott: systems.

945
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:26,510
Scott: You don't actually roll you just make the character to match whatever the PVC is or the right and you play and it plays Sort of like hero clicks and it's actually a pretty good game.

946
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:30,689
Rym: Like the fixes a lot of the crap that hero clicks has kind of wrong with it the the math of the.

947
00:51:30,709 --> 00:51:39,112
Scott: I mean It's still a miniatures combat game It's still dice and randomness and all that stuff that the dice actually works similarly to burning wheel with the successes and the failures and that.

948
00:51:39,693 --> 00:51:46,755
Scott: but the the the metaphor of the dice actually matches a fighting game like you do flurries and Combos and you do.

949
00:51:46,775 --> 00:51:50,647
Rym: you have special moves and yeah, like getting in close or being far away.

950
00:51:50,727 --> 00:51:57,750
Rym: You got projectiles Hadouken, he's got a mechanic with movement and projectiles where you like lay out these strips and that shows the distance.

951
00:51:57,851 --> 00:52:01,449
Scott: So it's like the old war games where it doesn't have to be super precise either, you know.

952
00:52:01,711 --> 00:52:02,455
Scott: So it's.

953
00:52:02,616 --> 00:52:04,265
Scott: it's a pretty high quality game.

954
00:52:04,286 --> 00:52:05,010
Scott: It's super fun.

955
00:52:05,211 --> 00:52:08,690
Scott: I'm gonna buy it and you know get the whole thing going on in, you know.

956
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:11,602
Scott: Now there's no reason to throw away all your old toys and it works.

957
00:52:11,883 --> 00:52:13,490
Scott: He played with like a big old Unicron.

958
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:15,235
Scott: He played with tiny stuff big stuff.

959
00:52:15,275 --> 00:52:15,816
Scott: It's all good.

960
00:52:15,977 --> 00:52:16,478
Scott: It all works.

961
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:26,993
Rym: So Live-streaming thing we tried to do where we played some jungle speed and if any of you watch that you might recall that we thought We were so smart.

962
00:52:27,014 --> 00:52:28,359
Rym: We're like this game is broken.

963
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,890
Rym: Scott took his turn, you know, it's the game where you flip up cars.

964
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:33,381
Rym: So with your same as I flip a card like this.

965
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:35,450
Rym: Scott flips a card like flip flip flip flip.

966
00:52:35,834 --> 00:52:43,470
Rym: And if the cards match in certain ways Then whoever grabs the jungle speed totem first like wins that round and the other player gets punished has to pick up all the cards.

967
00:52:43,651 --> 00:52:44,615
Rym: They're not out of cards you win.

968
00:52:45,118 --> 00:52:47,087
Rym: So I'm like, alright, this game's just broken.

969
00:52:47,107 --> 00:52:50,779
Rym: Scott take your turn I just put my fingers around the totem.

970
00:52:50,819 --> 00:52:51,822
Rym: I'm like go for it.

971
00:52:52,665 --> 00:52:56,481
Rym: Yeah Scott, you know flip his card I go up Or I go.

972
00:52:56,501 --> 00:52:58,775
Rym: All right Let's go continue.

973
00:52:59,016 --> 00:53:00,584
Scott: Yeah, so we go to this guy.

974
00:53:00,604 --> 00:53:01,930
Scott: He's demoing jungle speed.

975
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:05,970
Scott: So I'm like, all right, we gotta ask this guy if this game is broken or not right away.

976
00:53:06,111 --> 00:53:07,605
Rym: He's like European clearly.

977
00:53:07,746 --> 00:53:08,110
Rym: He's smart.

978
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:09,271
Scott: I you know I was.

979
00:53:09,372 --> 00:53:14,630
Scott: you know whenever I do this I expect that I'm gonna prove to this person that their game is broken.

980
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:18,450
Scott: But I hope that they will prove to me that I'm wrong and the game is awesome.

981
00:53:19,151 --> 00:53:21,850
Scott: This is a case of them proving to me that the game is actually awesome.

982
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:23,318
Rym: Yeah, the guy doesn't even Scott's like.

983
00:53:23,338 --> 00:53:24,263
Rym: so here's what the guy's like.

984
00:53:24,283 --> 00:53:25,368
Rym: All right, just show me what you do.

985
00:53:26,012 --> 00:53:26,756
Rym: Show me what you do.

986
00:53:26,817 --> 00:53:29,030
Scott: So I'm like, okay, I flip a card and when it's your turn.

987
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:32,288
Scott: I'm gonna put my hand around the totem like this and the guy just says just like that.

988
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:34,729
Rym: Yeah I guess you knocked it over.

989
00:53:35,711 --> 00:53:42,830
Scott: And if you the rule is if you knock if you're the last person to touch the totem and it gets knocked over Then you have to pick up all the cards in the table.

990
00:53:42,991 --> 00:53:45,170
Rym: I realized the rules don't say don't hit the other player.

991
00:53:45,371 --> 00:53:46,760
Rym: All it says is the totem.

992
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:48,350
Rym: whoever knocks the totem over loses.

993
00:53:48,571 --> 00:53:50,841
Scott: So the guy just whacked my hand and the totem went flying.

994
00:53:50,861 --> 00:53:51,905
Scott: and he's like take all the cards.

995
00:53:51,986 --> 00:53:55,457
Scott: and I'm like, oh, thank you so much You have fixed jungle speed.

996
00:53:55,477 --> 00:53:57,125
Rym: They were like, what are we grabbed at the same time?

997
00:53:57,205 --> 00:53:58,170
Rym: He's like most fingers.

998
00:53:58,573 --> 00:54:00,750
Rym: What is the same number of fingers closest to the bottom?

999
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:04,224
Rym: What if you know, we're on top of each other inside wins like.

1000
00:54:04,264 --> 00:54:05,510
Rym: it's all these obvious.

1001
00:54:05,711 --> 00:54:06,875
Rym: He should make a little radish II.

1002
00:54:07,076 --> 00:54:07,457
Scott: they should.

1003
00:54:07,478 --> 00:54:10,670
Scott: I'm gonna write new rules for jungle speed that fix the game.

1004
00:54:11,235 --> 00:54:12,729
Rym: So we're gonna play that game again.

1005
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:16,222
Rym: They're gonna play some jungle speed cuz I can still do the strategy of the blocking.

1006
00:54:16,282 --> 00:54:24,590
Scott: apparently the way they play is they'll usually Hold the deck in one hand You know their deck in one hand and play with the other hand to guarantee that they're only using one hand.

1007
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:27,930
Scott: Yep, and any edge of the table put their hand when it's not your turn.

1008
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:32,750
Scott: They'll put their hands on the edge of the table and then go ha for the totem like that man.

1009
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:34,981
Rym: They're so faking out this kind of game like spoons back there.

1010
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:36,630
Rym: I would be like, huh and not grab it.

1011
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:41,120
Rym: Yeah, I'd be like, I feel like I should make the Colossus noise every time.

1012
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:46,779
Scott: Yeah, so the guy fixed jungle speed for us, yeah, I was so happy about that.

1013
00:54:47,101 --> 00:54:50,460
Scott: Yeah, I think that pretty much covers what we did in tabletop.

1014
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,008
Scott: I wish I wish we would.

1015
00:54:52,028 --> 00:54:54,160
Scott: yeah, Luke crane ran his burning wheel demos.

1016
00:54:54,281 --> 00:54:55,751
Scott: A lot of people played there were pretty much.

1017
00:54:55,832 --> 00:54:56,658
Rym: it was so crowded.

1018
00:54:56,698 --> 00:55:01,119
Rym: one point He was trying to get hold of our friend Alex who does burning wheel demos wherever he can because he loves doing that.

1019
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:09,217
Rym: To get him because so many people wanted burning wheel demos, especially after our panel when basically he was like Yeah, all the books sold out like right away after our panel.

1020
00:55:09,378 --> 00:55:10,625
Scott: Yeah It was weird.

1021
00:55:10,645 --> 00:55:11,852
Scott: the complete strategist came.

1022
00:55:12,033 --> 00:55:14,347
Scott: it seems like they didn't stay on Sunday Which is really weird.

1023
00:55:14,387 --> 00:55:15,840
Rym: I sold out of everything that was selling.

1024
00:55:16,181 --> 00:55:24,820
Scott: Yeah, it was really I don't know but you know, they it seemed like they were in what they brought, you know They brought this giant stack of tickets to ride and zero dominions.

1025
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:28,835
Scott: It's like if maybe they didn't have dominions understandable or maybe that was excess stock.

1026
00:55:28,856 --> 00:55:29,578
Rym: They said to get rid of.

1027
00:55:29,739 --> 00:55:35,260
Scott: yeah It's like dude, if you wanted to make mad bank, you should have brought a giant stack of Dominion as tall as your ticket to ride.

1028
00:55:35,468 --> 00:55:38,299
Rym: No Thunderstone is not the greatest game.

1029
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:39,204
Scott: It would have sold.

1030
00:55:39,364 --> 00:55:45,233
Rym: not enough people have played it yet if you would add thunderstone out with a demo and you're like This is Dominion plus dungeon crawling.

1031
00:55:45,254 --> 00:55:46,260
Rym: They were sold every freaking cop.

1032
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,013
Scott: Yeah, but they sold like they sold out of action castle.

1033
00:55:49,314 --> 00:55:50,560
Scott: They sold out of burning wheel.

1034
00:55:50,721 --> 00:55:52,370
Scott: They had you know, and they didn't bring that many.

1035
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,140
Scott: They only brought like with 30 copies or so.

1036
00:55:54,281 --> 00:55:55,840
Scott: So yeah, I saw the whole stack.

1037
00:55:56,141 --> 00:55:59,660
Rym: I feel like I have a terrible power because so many people came up to me later in the con.

1038
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,953
Rym: They're like I tried to buy like any other every game we talked about.

1039
00:56:02,973 --> 00:56:05,417
Rym: they're like and I couldn't find it for sale or it sold out.

1040
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,314
Rym: Sorry, even the games like dogs in the vineyard that we didn't even talk about.

1041
00:56:10,374 --> 00:56:11,700
Rym: It's just it's in the panel description.

1042
00:56:11,841 --> 00:56:13,490
Scott: I was actually, you know sort of impressed.

1043
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:15,320
Scott: a lot of people come up to us during the con.

1044
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:18,760
Scott: They're like we want you to play X. We want you to come do this with us, you know.

1045
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:24,420
Scott: And I'm like, you know I have a hard time saying no and usually it doesn't happen just because it's hard to meet up with people.

1046
00:56:24,501 --> 00:56:26,540
Rym: Yeah, and too many of you were it didn't happen.

1047
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,191
Scott: Like I really wanted to play.

1048
00:56:28,252 --> 00:56:28,453
Scott: right.

1049
00:56:28,473 --> 00:56:29,400
Rym: so the vineyard with you.

1050
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:37,480
Scott: The thing is at PAX East everyone who wanted to do something with us except for the one dude who wanted to play dogs In the vineyard and the other people who wanted us to play their game.

1051
00:56:37,781 --> 00:56:39,248
Rym: Oh, we didn't go back to the.

1052
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:45,388
Rym: that education will make your game game either Where you make the game and then you play the game.

1053
00:56:45,649 --> 00:56:46,492
Scott: All right forget.

1054
00:56:46,512 --> 00:56:47,616
Rym: So that's nothing we fucked up.

1055
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:53,153
Scott: Yeah Other than that, right we did everything that we said we would do.

1056
00:56:53,193 --> 00:56:53,434
Scott: so it was.

1057
00:56:53,534 --> 00:56:54,980
Scott: actually we got a lot done.

1058
00:56:55,261 --> 00:56:57,211
Rym: Yeah, but I really wanted to play dogs in the vineyard.

1059
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:58,980
Rym: that guy he was the kind of guy to run it.

1060
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:00,526
Rym: He was the kind of guy like had his deal.

1061
00:57:00,767 --> 00:57:04,000
Rym: Yes, like when uncle yo runs the inspectors like he knows exactly what he's doing.

1062
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:04,643
Scott: Let's talk about.

1063
00:57:04,663 --> 00:57:06,129
Scott: the education will make the game game.

1064
00:57:06,149 --> 00:57:06,992
Scott: All right.

1065
00:57:07,052 --> 00:57:08,960
Rym: Yeah, so the concept here who was that?

1066
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:09,341
Scott: You did it.

1067
00:57:10,064 --> 00:57:12,394
Scott: It was some guy that we met like once in the past.

1068
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:13,158
Scott: I forget his name.

1069
00:57:13,178 --> 00:57:15,736
Rym: Sorry, dude Yeah, but we'll do a show on this like GeekNights.

1070
00:57:15,756 --> 00:57:16,180
Rym: So don't worry.

1071
00:57:16,281 --> 00:57:21,440
Rym: Well, we're gonna talk about this a lot But the concept is that you make a game aimed at younger kids where it's a flash game.

1072
00:57:21,581 --> 00:57:23,409
Rym: The game is your plate.

1073
00:57:23,429 --> 00:57:25,880
Rym: you have a game that is broken like and every game is different.

1074
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:26,845
Rym: Like what's the platformer?

1075
00:57:26,865 --> 00:57:27,508
Rym: What's the tile game?

1076
00:57:27,548 --> 00:57:27,890
Rym: Whatever.

1077
00:57:28,452 --> 00:57:30,080
Rym: and you fix the game?

1078
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:35,260
Scott: The game is yeah, basically you're playing a game and while you're playing the game you have play mode and edit modes.

1079
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,699
Scott: You like a level will be broken.

1080
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:41,841
Scott: You'll have to go to edit mode and fix the broken level then go to play mode and get to the end of the low One.

1081
00:57:41,881 --> 00:57:46,920
Rym: that's a concept that you could take in a lot of directions, but they're taking it in this like educational kid direction.

1082
00:57:47,621 --> 00:57:48,123
Scott: Yeah, it was.

1083
00:57:48,203 --> 00:57:49,087
Scott: it was pretty awesome.

1084
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:50,915
Scott: So I highly recommend it.

1085
00:57:50,976 --> 00:57:52,544
Scott: if I can remember the name of it I would tell it.

1086
00:57:52,564 --> 00:57:53,912
Rym: we'll do a whole show about it.

1087
00:57:53,933 --> 00:57:54,999
Scott: We'll put a link up and all that.

1088
00:57:55,802 --> 00:58:00,556
Rym: So we did three panels at PAX East the exact same three we did at PAX West.

1089
00:58:00,897 --> 00:58:01,880
Scott: they you know.

1090
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:02,623
Scott: It was surprising.

1091
00:58:02,643 --> 00:58:06,220
Scott: we did beyond D&D first and I actually felt like it wasn't our best beyond.

1092
00:58:06,421 --> 00:58:10,117
Rym: I was just like I was really wrecked and we forgot some stuff.

1093
00:58:10,137 --> 00:58:10,800
Rym: We backpedaled.

1094
00:58:11,001 --> 00:58:13,772
Rym: We didn't do our usual disclaimer about how much we actually loved D&D.

1095
00:58:14,013 --> 00:58:15,038
Rym: Yeah halfway through.

1096
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:16,164
Scott: Yeah It wasn't.

1097
00:58:16,225 --> 00:58:17,454
Scott: I wasn't like what.

1098
00:58:17,534 --> 00:58:24,429
Scott: while I was up there I was like, this is not our best beyond D&D, but you know what people loved it Crane told me afterwards.

1099
00:58:24,469 --> 00:58:25,174
Scott: I was like hilarious.

1100
00:58:25,194 --> 00:58:25,858
Scott: I was like, what are you talking?

1101
00:58:25,898 --> 00:58:26,160
Scott: the whole?

1102
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:27,923
Rym: Entire convention.

1103
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:30,995
Rym: people kept coming up to me like so beyond Dungeons & Dragons.

1104
00:58:31,036 --> 00:58:31,337
Rym: They like.

1105
00:58:31,357 --> 00:58:32,160
Rym: question that a comment.

1106
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:33,186
Rym: Everyone said it was great.

1107
00:58:33,206 --> 00:58:38,329
Rym: I don't want to chew my own horn, but I Feel you liked even a crappy rendition of.

1108
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:39,453
Scott: you know, it's like we.

1109
00:58:39,514 --> 00:58:41,220
Scott: it's like if you have a song it's a good song.

1110
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,446
Scott: It's a song people like.

1111
00:58:42,507 --> 00:58:44,940
Scott: that's a hit but you did a poor singing job.

1112
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:48,500
Scott: You got some notes wrong and I guess people still thought it's very hard of it.

1113
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,106
Rym: Is that one?

1114
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:50,399
Rym: even if we do a bad job?

1115
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,070
Rym: Even if we did a terrible job the content matters.

1116
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:53,552
Rym: There's a reason.

1117
00:58:53,592 --> 00:58:55,800
Rym: we've been doing this panel what this is our third packs.

1118
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,506
Rym: We've done it at yeah, like we did.

1119
00:58:57,526 --> 00:58:58,831
Scott: we gotta retire this shit.

1120
00:58:58,871 --> 00:59:00,055
Rym: We did it at Otakon.

1121
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:01,340
Rym: We might do it at magfest.

1122
00:59:01,783 --> 00:59:03,033
Scott: Yeah, we'll see a magfest.

1123
00:59:03,074 --> 00:59:03,880
Scott: I would do it again someday.

1124
00:59:04,001 --> 00:59:07,180
Rym: I want to record like a definitive version and be done with it right after that.

1125
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,010
Scott: We did losing should be fun, which I think we didn't.

1126
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:09,775
Scott: even worse job.

1127
00:59:09,795 --> 00:59:10,660
Rym: I think you did a better job.

1128
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:11,243
Rym: I think it was really.

1129
00:59:11,263 --> 00:59:12,631
Scott: think so cuz I was falling.

1130
00:59:12,671 --> 00:59:14,240
Scott: It's literally falling asleep.

1131
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:19,467
Rym: But I was like, uh, see beyond D&D is like a to a both of us panel Like we both wrote it straight up.

1132
00:59:19,508 --> 00:59:20,874
Rym: We both perform it with equal parts.

1133
00:59:21,377 --> 00:59:25,632
Rym: losing should be fun Like I wrote and I Drive and Scott provides commentary and insight.

1134
00:59:25,693 --> 00:59:29,748
Rym: and beyond Candyland Scott Drive Scott wrote I just provide insight and commentary.

1135
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:31,374
Rym: So I driving.

1136
00:59:31,414 --> 00:59:34,379
Rym: I think losing should be fun cuz I had some coffee So I had a second wind for that one.

1137
00:59:34,741 --> 00:59:38,720
Rym: So I think I pulled it all the way off and yeah, you were kind of falling asleep toward the end.

1138
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:42,003
Scott: I was literally like yeah Like I'm like.

1139
00:59:42,043 --> 00:59:45,130
Scott: that's so bad if you're on doing a panel and you're just like meh.

1140
00:59:45,992 --> 00:59:50,807
Rym: But at the same time again the contents of what matters because Everyone's had those experience like beyond D&D.

1141
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:57,503
Rym: I mean look no one in that room except for that core of like fanboys who come to all our panels and already know us Even though it's the same panel.

1142
00:59:57,543 --> 01:00:00,879
Rym: every time everyone else didn't know we were gonna say and they're all D&D people.

1143
01:00:01,321 --> 01:00:10,959
Rym: and the moment I live for and beyond D&D is when We say like D&D combat takes for fucking ever and you see people whenever I see people nodding Yeah, that's what I know.

1144
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:11,806
Scott: It's going well.

1145
01:00:11,866 --> 01:00:16,377
Rym: and like the moment I said what if you just abstracted currency and you didn't count?

1146
01:00:16,518 --> 01:00:22,610
Rym: because it doesn't matter you want to skip to the fun part and there's one guy up in the front who went And he went to his friend.

1147
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:23,781
Rym: he's like what another.

1148
01:00:23,862 --> 01:00:32,690
Rym: and I think it resonates because there are a lot of people who want these better role-playing Experiences and D&D is good for what it is, but it isn't good at that.

1149
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:38,390
Rym: So I think that's why the panel is so good because even if we keep doing if you do it at every packs forever.

1150
01:00:38,954 --> 01:00:41,310
Rym: Most of the people in the room have not seen it and don't know.

1151
01:00:41,832 --> 01:00:43,922
Rym: That's why we got to make a video and get the word out there.

1152
01:00:44,203 --> 01:00:47,597
Rym: I don't want to take up tax time anymore Yeah, I just want everyone to know this stuff.

1153
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,164
Scott: Yeah losing should be fun.

1154
01:00:49,365 --> 01:00:51,515
Scott: We talked about dwarf fortress Yeah, and such.

1155
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:52,721
Scott: it was about losing.

1156
01:00:52,741 --> 01:00:53,586
Scott: It was a panel.

1157
01:00:53,686 --> 01:00:53,928
Scott: Yeah.

1158
01:00:54,048 --> 01:00:59,870
Rym: All right I think the plan with that panel is we'll probably run it at some other packs or something at some point.

1159
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:07,420
Rym: But I think I'm gonna break it up because we basically touched on like single-player losing Multiplayer losing and narrative branching losing.

1160
01:01:07,781 --> 01:01:09,426
Rym: those could each be a panel.

1161
01:01:09,747 --> 01:01:10,530
Rym: that losing should be fun.

1162
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:15,630
Rym: It's kind of the overarching like think about the idea that losing should be fun that your game should always be fun.

1163
01:01:15,951 --> 01:01:18,502
Rym: If there's any point your games not fun games fucking broken.

1164
01:01:19,266 --> 01:01:21,799
Scott: Yep beyond candy line I think we actually did really well.

1165
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,730
Scott: It was the room was not a hundred percent full.

1166
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:26,003
Scott: It was like 90 percent full, you know, we did.

1167
01:01:26,084 --> 01:01:27,130
Scott: we ran the panel really?

1168
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:30,370
Scott: Well, the only thing was that we were sort of pressed for time, you know.

1169
01:01:30,471 --> 01:01:33,578
Scott: So I sort of rushed the end a little bit But the rest of the panel was.

1170
01:01:33,618 --> 01:01:35,690
Scott: it was a you know, it's usual awesome panel.

1171
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:38,302
Rym: We'll try to get these up online in whatever forms we can.

1172
01:01:38,362 --> 01:01:38,844
Rym: as much.

1173
01:01:38,884 --> 01:01:40,210
Scott: beyond candy land was filmed.

1174
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:40,953
Scott: We're doing we.

1175
01:01:41,013 --> 01:01:45,630
Scott: there's a someone up in New Hampshire who's doing a board game documentary someone awesome, by the way.

1176
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:50,290
Scott: Yeah, we went and interviewed with them on after packs was over on Tuesday on our way to fun spot.

1177
01:01:50,712 --> 01:01:53,750
Scott: But they recorded and filmed the beyond candy land panel.

1178
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:56,138
Scott: So that's gonna be on the the Internet's.

1179
01:01:56,338 --> 01:02:00,090
Scott: hopefully ish soon and also maybe even in a documentary or who knows what?

1180
01:02:00,411 --> 01:02:05,470
Rym: I'm gonna try to get her other stuff online even the bad running of beyond D&D because a bad one is better than nothing.

1181
01:02:05,731 --> 01:02:06,795
Scott: Yep, people want to see it.

1182
01:02:07,136 --> 01:02:08,581
Scott: Yep and action castle.

1183
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:14,000
Scott: Of course, we did action castle and also jungle adventure And it was the typical awesome.

1184
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:17,809
Rym: They died Jared like he had a sore throat Like he was kind of sick trying to run this but he did it.

1185
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:23,297
Scott: Anyway, they had a rough time dealing with the with the ogre Troll the troll.

1186
01:02:23,337 --> 01:02:24,385
Scott: they couldn't get past the troll.

1187
01:02:24,405 --> 01:02:25,070
Scott: they kept dying.

1188
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:27,101
Scott: It was not a good sight to see.

1189
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:30,950
Rym: it was funny because you know We did the action castle like thing in the main events.

1190
01:02:31,231 --> 01:02:34,806
Rym: So, of course action castle sold out and everyone kept hearing us talk about it.

1191
01:02:34,826 --> 01:02:35,770
Rym: people already knew about it.

1192
01:02:36,111 --> 01:02:39,890
Rym: So I think a lot of people like memorized it or came into this like knowing what to expect.

1193
01:02:40,251 --> 01:02:41,658
Rym: So they won pretty hand.

1194
01:02:41,678 --> 01:02:42,742
Scott: There were a lot of people cheating.

1195
01:02:42,762 --> 01:02:44,530
Scott: They had pieces of paper and they were writing.

1196
01:02:46,294 --> 01:02:47,589
Rym: But yeah, I think that's awesome.

1197
01:02:48,292 --> 01:02:49,436
Rym: But jungle adventure happened.

1198
01:02:49,456 --> 01:02:53,129
Rym: you I know people like came into this thinking they'd be awesome and like know what to do.

1199
01:02:53,571 --> 01:02:56,743
Rym: Like someone came in they're like save game because they knew.

1200
01:02:56,763 --> 01:02:59,254
Rym: but then jungle adventure suddenly Oh shit, like.

1201
01:02:59,616 --> 01:03:02,210
Scott: I never played jungle adventure before so I had no clue what to do.

1202
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:05,101
Scott: Luke crane actually told me some secrets of jungle adventure.

1203
01:03:05,121 --> 01:03:05,965
Rym: Yeah, I like jungle.

1204
01:03:06,005 --> 01:03:07,230
Rym: I like the fire ants thing a lot.

1205
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:08,715
Scott: Yeah, the fire thing was good.

1206
01:03:08,755 --> 01:03:09,719
Scott: You get the fire ants on you.

1207
01:03:09,739 --> 01:03:12,790
Scott: You're gonna die in three turns, but it was weird.

1208
01:03:12,894 --> 01:03:17,446
Rym: You know We always thought that PAX is like where it's hard to be a celebrity like it's.

1209
01:03:17,666 --> 01:03:20,900
Rym: it's harder to break into It's real deal like the panels of serious business.

1210
01:03:20,941 --> 01:03:24,689
Rym: Everything's real and anime cons You know like we do these million panels.

1211
01:03:25,192 --> 01:03:28,406
Rym: But PAX is where like everyone kept coming up to us throughout the con like.

1212
01:03:28,486 --> 01:03:29,410
Rym: oh, man, that panel was great.

1213
01:03:29,491 --> 01:03:30,159
Rym: Oh, man, I have a quick.

1215
01:03:34,879 --> 01:03:36,973
Scott: fans come up to us But it's not constant.

1216
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:39,922
Scott: at PAX it East at least never really at the West.

1217
01:03:40,022 --> 01:03:49,375
Scott: it felt like when I was walking around the hallways Like every minute or two someone would come up to me or if I'd be in a line somewhere someone would say hey panels are Awesome, sweet

1218
01:03:49,516 --> 01:03:55,663
Rym: or like just constant college humor guys, you know We went to your panel and cuz we're interested in darkly like we do enough

1220
01:03:57,991 --> 01:03:59,450
Scott: We went to the college humor panel.

1221
01:03:59,530 --> 01:04:02,039

Rym: You know, he's one of the college humor guys, you know The guy with the glasses and the kind of scraggly but anyway, he's walking up and I'm walking next to him.

1224
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:13,690
Rym: I'm like, hey, you look like you're on your way to the college humor panel.

1225
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:16,884
Rym: He's like, I may be and I'm like, I'm on my way too.

1226
01:04:16,904 --> 01:04:17,205
Rym: And he's like.

1227
01:04:17,245 --> 01:04:22,950
Rym: I hear those guys are handsome But actually Emily thought he was just some listeners, okay, I blew him off.

1228
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:25,403
Rym: So we go in and after their panel, I go up to talk to him.

1229
01:04:25,423 --> 01:04:26,730
Rym: cuz I want to talk about darkly.

1230
01:04:26,811 --> 01:04:28,110
Rym: I want to I think darkly.

1231
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:32,530
Scott: Yeah, if you don't know they're making a new site called darkly and basically, you know college humor.

1232
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:38,684
Scott: There's a lot of nerdy videos like Tetris guy There's those Mortal Kombat parodies Street Fighter later years.

1233
01:04:38,704 --> 01:04:39,910
Scott: They do a lot of gaming stuff.

1234
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:43,750
Scott: But the thing is they avoid stuff that's too obscure for normal people to inside baseball.

1235
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:50,490
Scott: But right, so they're making a new site darkly where they can do the stuff that would be too inside baseball for college humor.

1236
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:53,710
Rym: What's cool though their point like and it kind of echoed actually will weed in this keynote.

1237
01:04:53,851 --> 01:04:59,669
Rym: They were like look we think that if we just had video game references They're ubiquitous enough for people will get him.

1238
01:05:00,072 --> 01:05:03,330
Rym: But we can't get away with that as much with just the college humor stuff with the demographic.

1239
01:05:03,732 --> 01:05:05,258
Rym: Let's go all out and see what happens.

1240
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:06,624
Rym: I look forward to that with.

1241
01:05:07,126 --> 01:05:08,090
Scott: I look forward to that site.

1242
01:05:08,191 --> 01:05:09,210
Scott: It'll be a frequent visitor.

1243
01:05:09,432 --> 01:05:11,410
Scott: I hope it produces many fine things of the day.

1244
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:13,610
Rym: But I went up to talk to him because you know, I didn't know about darkly.

1245
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:15,290
Rym: So I was like, yeah, we got to talk about this.

1246
01:05:15,372 --> 01:05:15,868
Rym: Oh my god.

1247
01:05:16,251 --> 01:05:25,185
Rym: And while I was up there talking to them these people who came up to talk to them after their panel We're like, I think the guy who asked that question was Scott.

1248
01:05:25,868 --> 01:05:26,490
Rym: Oh that Scott.

1249
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:28,599
Rym: Yeah, the guy from GeekNights did the action castle thing.

1250
01:05:29,141 --> 01:05:31,330
Rym: and then they then some other guy comes up to me.

1251
01:05:31,370 --> 01:05:32,576
Rym: He's like, oh my god Rym.

1252
01:05:32,656 --> 01:05:36,132
Rym: I was at your beyond D&D panel and then those guys like oh my god Is that Rym?

1253
01:05:36,152 --> 01:05:43,088
Rym: and like this weird clusterfuck and at all these people asking me questions in front of them Waiting for you last them questions.

1254
01:05:45,731 --> 01:05:46,937
Scott: I was outside while that was going on.

1255
01:05:46,957 --> 01:05:58,647
Rym: Yeah So back to the present on Tuesday with us in New York and not in Boston too.

1256
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:01,617
Scott: Well, I think you know, there's a yeah.

1257
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:04,084
Scott: Anyway, my many Tuesdays do not be confused.

1258
01:06:04,104 --> 01:06:06,010
Scott: as of right now of this talking.

1259
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:07,555
Scott: It is Tuesday, April 6.

1260
01:06:07,555 --> 01:06:07,776
Rym: Yes.

1261
01:06:07,916 --> 01:06:10,123
Rym: Pax is long gone anime Boston long gone.

1262
01:06:10,163 --> 01:06:12,370
Scott: But you know, what any of us is not long gone.

1263
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:13,290
Scott: It's shortly gone.

1264
01:06:14,651 --> 01:06:18,302
Scott: Feels like forever ago, but PAX West is less than six months.

1265
01:06:18,442 --> 01:06:20,710
Rym: I know and PAX East is less than a year away.

1266
01:06:23,294 --> 01:06:23,757
Scott: I can't wait.

1267
01:06:23,778 --> 01:06:24,140
Scott: I don't know.

1268
01:06:24,161 --> 01:06:24,746
Scott: We don't have packs.

1269
01:06:24,826 --> 01:06:25,827
Scott: East dates You never know.

1270
01:06:26,191 --> 01:06:26,351
Scott: so

1271
01:06:27,033 --> 01:06:41,730
Rym: I think what we want to do the thing we didn't get to when we're recording this stuff in Boston is kind of The crazy moments of packs like all the kind of things that didn't really fit anywhere else Just the stuff that really stood out up to us and I don't know kind of in reverse order.

1272
01:06:41,811 --> 01:06:43,109
Rym: I want to start with the elbow bump.

1273
01:06:43,672 --> 01:06:47,666
Scott: The elbow bump very important with this carried over to anime Boston for us as well and it were.

1274
01:06:47,727 --> 01:06:56,075
Rym: and it got to the point To where people who approached us came elbow ready because they remembered and every time someone like gave us the handshake I'd be like no elbow.

1275
01:06:56,557 --> 01:06:58,644
Rym: and once they realize what was up there like oh crap.

1276
01:06:58,664 --> 01:06:59,346
Rym: Yeah disease.

1277
01:06:59,407 --> 01:06:59,748
Rym: Damn it.

1278
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:02,256
Scott: Yeah I mean packs penny arcade.

1279
01:07:02,276 --> 01:07:08,130
Scott: put up the comic telling you to use the iron guard position right instead of using You know the elbow.

1280
01:07:08,732 --> 01:07:14,508
Rym: I wonder how many people realize that the iron guard position is basically the I am invisible and larping position sort.

1281
01:07:14,548 --> 01:07:14,629
Scott: of.

1282
01:07:14,729 --> 01:07:28,484
Scott: the problem I have with the iron guard position right is that there is a. there is a psychological thing about like You know touching somebody right like they did a whole bunch of studies where it's like, okay They'll have someone go into a phone booth and leave a wallet behind, you know.

1283
01:07:28,805 --> 01:07:33,289
Scott: and on their way out of the phone booth They'll touch the person who's waiting to get into the phone booth.

1284
01:07:33,751 --> 01:07:39,850
Scott: And if they do that then the person will more often, you know call them and be like, hey your wallet.

1285
01:07:39,991 --> 01:07:45,930
Scott: But if you don't touch the person on your way out of the phone booth It is less likely that they will say hey your wallet, right?

1286
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:49,490
Rym: So what happens if you pick up the phone booth, right so that you die?

1287
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:50,213
Scott: But the point?

1288
01:07:50,353 --> 01:07:54,530
Scott: so the point of a handshake is you know, you you touch this person and there is something about that.

1289
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:58,330
Scott: The iron guard position, you know eliminates all touching whatsoever.

1290
01:07:58,812 --> 01:08:01,504
Scott: And the thing is you don't really need to eliminate all the touching.

1291
01:08:01,544 --> 01:08:08,105
Scott: you can do the elbow bump Which gives you the touching that has the same psychological impact as you know.

1292
01:08:08,527 --> 01:08:17,069
Scott: a handshake, you know Maybe not quite as much but you but you don't have to get me your your hands on their hands Do not contact and the hands are you know?

1293
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:22,575
Rym: The the disease transfer positions and I think the way forward because you know This elbow bump.

1294
01:08:22,675 --> 01:08:29,984
Rym: iron guard thing kind of came out of the fact that there was an unrelated Norovirus outbreak at like colleges and everyone got swine flu at Pax West Yep.

1295
01:08:30,513 --> 01:08:39,800
Rym: So I think what we need to do is every time there's a con The con should just lie and say there's an outbreak of something like that and remind everyone to elbow bump And then the kids won't get sick.

1296
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,109
Scott: You don't even need to do an elbow bump.

1297
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:44,443
Scott: You should just be like yeah cons are you know, dens of horrible disease.

1298
01:08:44,464 --> 01:08:45,908
Scott: Do not shake hands with anyone.

1299
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:47,790
Rym: It amazes me that everyone just bump elbows.

1300
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:50,219
Rym: New York fucking city does not make me sick.

1301
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:53,189
Rym: touching like grimy subways and then sticking my finger in my eye.

1302
01:08:53,331 --> 01:08:57,032
Scott: Cuz you wash your fucking hands even though I don't that often and you know You could.

1303
01:08:57,073 --> 01:08:59,127
Scott: you know, it's actually really easy to get in New York City.

1304
01:08:59,169 --> 01:09:01,666
Scott: pink I feel like if you're on the subway and you rub your eyes.

1305
01:09:01,767 --> 01:09:02,430
Scott: pink eye Ho.

1306
01:09:02,612 --> 01:09:05,725
Rym: I think I is one of the things I fear almost more than death.

1307
01:09:05,845 --> 01:09:06,810
Rym: I hate pink eyes so much.

1308
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:07,495
Scott: What's to fear?

1309
01:09:07,536 --> 01:09:09,170
Scott: your eye just goes in for a little while?

1310
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:09,551
Rym: I hate that.

1311
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:12,082
Rym: anything where that makes my eyes itch just drives me crazy.

1312
01:09:12,162 --> 01:09:24,276
Scott: I can't deal with it's not so bad I mean if you get a lot worse things than pink eye like I don't know Norovirus where you're basically puking and diarrhea and like crazy, but at least that ends quickly A couple days.

1313
01:09:24,316 --> 01:09:27,224
Scott: Yeah, I'll tell you what I'll take ten pink guys over one norovirus.

1314
01:09:27,604 --> 01:09:31,974
Rym: I don't know where they consecutive or concurrent Both ten times.

1315
01:09:32,054 --> 01:09:35,002
Scott: It'll be ten squared guys in both eyes at the same time.

1316
01:09:35,063 --> 01:09:36,227
Rym: number nine.

1317
01:09:36,346 --> 01:09:37,350
Rym: There's no actual list.

1318
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:38,495
Rym: I'm just kind of going up from things.

1319
01:09:38,555 --> 01:09:39,620
Rym: I jotted a notepad.

1320
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,593
Rym: Yeah, and in case we didn't talk about it the omegathon whatever.

1321
01:09:43,116 --> 01:09:51,152
Rym: the omegathon finale was The most epic or at least I think equal to the excite bike epicness It was.

1322
01:09:51,192 --> 01:09:53,203
Scott: it was a good omegathon finale right.

1323
01:09:53,224 --> 01:09:54,250
Scott: there was a. it was good.

1324
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:57,893
Scott: There was no way I could have predicted it right, but once I saw it It was obvious.

1325
01:09:58,314 --> 01:10:01,285
Scott: the thing is right for the second omegathon in a row.

1326
01:10:01,305 --> 01:10:07,190
Rym: there are technological difficulties Yeah But at the same time the fact that there were so few I expected disaster.

1327
01:10:07,532 --> 01:10:10,530
Rym: When I saw what they were trying to do all I thought was there's no way this is gonna.

1328
01:10:10,751 --> 01:10:12,560
Scott: You know they did do test runs of it.

1329
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:14,570
Scott: You know I mean, I don't think we could have done any better.

1330
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:19,730
Scott: I think the thing is that they mess up right and that they insist on using the actual technology.

1331
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:20,534
Rym: They should lie.

1332
01:10:20,674 --> 01:10:22,182
Rym: they should just have the NES there.

1333
01:10:22,423 --> 01:10:23,990
Rym: make everything look like it's in an NES.

1334
01:10:24,371 --> 01:10:29,330
Rym: But behind that NES is a NES controller to USB converter and a frickin emulator.

1335
01:10:29,410 --> 01:10:30,394
Scott: It's just yeah, they should use.

1336
01:10:30,414 --> 01:10:32,201
Scott: they have all those Dell PC's right.

1337
01:10:32,241 --> 01:10:34,389
Scott: you can grab like ten of them and use them.

1338
01:10:34,650 --> 01:10:38,246
Rym: You know I'm sure there are concerns about legality, and they're big and they don't want to worry.

1339
01:10:38,768 --> 01:10:40,395
Rym: Just fake it Just totally fake it.

1340
01:10:40,495 --> 01:10:41,379
Rym: no one would know.

1341
01:10:41,499 --> 01:10:55,115
Scott: look just if you worry about the legality right I don't think anyone is gonna challenge you right on You know if you emulate an NES game and right there you have an NES and the game and the controller is just sitting there You know and may have.

1342
01:10:55,155 --> 01:10:55,396
Scott: you know.

1343
01:10:55,436 --> 01:10:56,721
Scott: if you need to you have to.

1344
01:10:56,761 --> 01:11:03,025
Scott: if you need ten you have ten and just use the Emulator right in front of it, but like I said nobody is gonna complain if you fake it.

1345
01:11:03,406 --> 01:11:05,228
Rym: you're double protected That's true.

1346
01:11:05,963 --> 01:11:12,550
Scott: But anyway You know and you can use the actual controllers the USB connection and it doesn't need to be authentic if it Roo if it ruins.

1347
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:17,764
Scott: The suspense then you know and the awesomeness of the omega-thon with a technological difficulty.

1348
01:11:18,165 --> 01:11:20,170
Scott: don't use the old busted technology.

1349
01:11:20,431 --> 01:11:27,438
Rym: But luckily at least with this omega-thon like he got all the way through and then there was kind of the choke near the end But before kind of the ultimate round of it.

1350
01:11:28,061 --> 01:11:30,230
Rym: so we basically got to experience the omega-thon twice.

1351
01:11:30,512 --> 01:11:36,850
Scott: Yeah, I thought you know I on the one hand I thought that you know on the second go-through after all had been revealed the suspense would lessen.

1352
01:11:37,314 --> 01:11:40,435
Scott: But after they started playing the suspense It came right back in.

1353
01:11:40,455 --> 01:11:42,683
Rym: so I have two points about the omega-thon finale.

1354
01:11:42,823 --> 01:11:44,710
Rym: one team left got robbed.

1355
01:11:45,571 --> 01:11:48,907
Rym: Team left did indeed get robbed because team right did not know how to play Mario.

1356
01:11:49,008 --> 01:11:51,158
Scott: one right I did not know how to play for crap.

1357
01:11:51,198 --> 01:12:00,818
Scott: team right the right team on the right sucked ass Right, but then because they got to do a second go around because of the technological difficulties They knew where the coins were right.

1358
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:03,009
Scott: the team on the right was able to come back.

1359
01:12:03,432 --> 01:12:07,110
Rym: The thing is the key team on the left despite you know in the second round they screwed up.

1360
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:10,730
Rym: They had a couple of chokes and Tetris and such, but when they got to the contra round.

1361
01:12:11,113 --> 01:12:13,429
Rym: They were catching up so fast they almost won in any way.

1362
01:12:13,691 --> 01:12:14,473
Scott: Yeah, that's you know.

1363
01:12:14,493 --> 01:12:16,600
Scott: the team on the left was clear the superior team.

1364
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:21,338
Scott: the thing is you know it says clearly in the omega-thon Rules they they decide who wins.

1365
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:23,487
Scott: there is no appeals process, which is fine.

1366
01:12:23,507 --> 01:12:32,253
Rym: the only problem I had like I feel bad for him But one of the guys on that team looked kind of genuinely pissed as opposed to good-naturedly pissed Mmm.

1367
01:12:32,413 --> 01:12:34,523
Rym: I felt kind of bad for him, but at the same time.

1368
01:12:34,885 --> 01:12:35,367
Rym: What are you gonna?

1369
01:12:35,387 --> 01:12:36,070
Rym: Do it's entertainment?

1370
01:12:36,291 --> 01:12:37,315
Rym: I mean yeah.

1371
01:12:37,656 --> 01:12:41,230
Rym: the other point is that neither one of those teams could play any of those games for shit.

1372
01:12:41,673 --> 01:12:42,418
Rym: And I don't know.

1373
01:12:42,438 --> 01:12:44,190
Scott: the team on the left was okay at Contra.

1374
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:44,656
Rym: They were good.

1375
01:12:44,677 --> 01:12:50,645
Scott: they were pretty good at Contra But they couldn't play Mario 1 or Tetris and rad racer is such an easy game.

1376
01:12:50,685 --> 01:12:51,769
Scott: everyone played it just fine.

1377
01:12:51,829 --> 01:12:54,780
Rym: Yep I don't know that Tetris part really got to me.

1378
01:12:54,821 --> 01:12:59,240
Scott: just and the whole audience - that was another thing I you know they want to talk about like you know.

1379
01:12:59,401 --> 01:13:02,476
Scott: oh it has to be the real system Otherwise it doesn't count.

1380
01:13:02,516 --> 01:13:07,139
Scott: right we have to use the real control in Tetris right But they gave the two teams different Tetris's.

1381
01:13:07,179 --> 01:13:09,930
Scott: they didn't work both playing the same version of Tetris.

1382
01:13:10,191 --> 01:13:18,870
Scott: So if you're worried about a fair competition using actual NES's or whatever Then how could you also not be concerned with using two different Tetris versions?

1383
01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:21,383
Rym: That's yes the problem they ran into.

1384
01:13:21,403 --> 01:13:22,530
Scott: that's hypocritical right there.

1385
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:26,163
Scott: So you know no excuse not to use the emulators that will work perfectly every time.

1386
01:13:26,284 --> 01:13:27,669
Rym: with the the whole Konami code thing.

1387
01:13:27,689 --> 01:13:29,120
Rym: you know The problem they had with Contra.

1388
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:33,410
Rym: they made him have to start over Props to coup for being there to put it in on the spot.

1389
01:13:33,772 --> 01:13:36,145
Rym: Imagine if he had screwed that up, and they had to do it a third time.

1390
01:13:36,165 --> 01:13:37,562
Rym: Yeah, he had it He did it.

1391
01:13:38,031 --> 01:13:42,918
Rym: But I think it would have been better if they didn't enter the code And they just gave you Contra.

1392
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:44,910
Rym: and if you didn't know the code and you got game.

1393
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:49,710
Scott: Oh, if you could enter the code or if you got game over you could you know just keep restarting.

1394
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:50,706
Scott: Yeah, so you got it.

1395
01:13:51,331 --> 01:13:52,496
Rym: I mean imagine that.

1396
01:13:52,556 --> 01:14:01,810
Rym: imagine if you know one team just like goes for it and starts to die and the other team just Konami codes it and then the audience realizes the Konami code But then the other team wins anyway because they're just that good a cop.

1397
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:02,853
Scott: I think the only read.

1398
01:14:02,873 --> 01:14:15,309
Scott: the argument against that though is that you know in trials right because they tried it out and The the time between the winner and the loser was one second, so they were like oh, this is perfect It's gonna be so down to the wire and awesome Yeah.

1399
01:14:15,471 --> 01:14:19,970
Scott: But if you if one team knew the Konami code the other didn't it would be a no contest.

1400
01:14:20,010 --> 01:14:30,390
Rym: He'd be like ah but at the same time see this is the trouble because you are correct for the entertainment of the crowd That was the best option, but does someone who doesn't know the Konami code deserve to win the omega-thon?

1401
01:14:30,992 --> 01:14:32,297
Scott: Well does someone who doesn't?

1402
01:14:32,417 --> 01:14:35,930
Scott: it was trying to go down every single pipe and Mario one deserved to win the omega-thon.

1403
01:14:36,036 --> 01:14:36,853
Scott: No But they did so.

1404
01:14:37,939 --> 01:14:44,464
Rym: if he'd been small we might not have noticed But the fact that there's that big-ass Mario just ducking on all the clearly non duckable pipes.

1405
01:14:44,765 --> 01:14:47,238
Rym: Yeah, I was just sad that guy He'd be.

1406
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:57,718
Scott: you know We I think we need to recreate this this challenge minus the contra part You know because that part was uninteresting and You know just see what how we can do.

1407
01:14:57,738 --> 01:15:00,007
Scott: I think I think I could beat you in a Mario 150 coin.

1408
01:15:04,651 --> 01:15:05,368
Rym: Doubt that?

1409
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:07,720
Rym: Okay, we'll set it up.

1410
01:15:07,781 --> 01:15:12,304
Rym: We have to have some sort of live Rimmens got dual uh-huh anyway.

1411
01:15:12,364 --> 01:15:12,686
Rym: We'll see.

1412
01:15:13,128 --> 01:15:13,630
Rym: so briefly.

1413
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:17,830
Rym: I don't want to dwell on these but our panels went freaking awesome and everyone in the crowd was badass.

1414
01:15:17,971 --> 01:15:20,469
Rym: I got to say one thing this this actually surprised me.

1415
01:15:21,052 --> 01:15:28,010
Rym: We had a little bit of extra time just because the way the staggering was in the panels And we took some questions something we never really do it packs.

1416
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:32,542
Rym: The questions people asked were great like they were good questions.

1417
01:15:32,562 --> 01:15:34,027
Scott: Yeah, I mean some of them were awesome.

1418
01:15:34,067 --> 01:15:36,876
Scott: some of them were okay You know but there were no questions.

1419
01:15:36,896 --> 01:15:38,362
Scott: where I was like shut up fanboy.

1420
01:15:38,442 --> 01:15:40,690
Scott: every question was a quality question.

1421
01:15:41,092 --> 01:15:42,638
Scott: You know I mean we got the.

1422
01:15:42,799 --> 01:15:44,506
Scott: of course you always get the occasional.

1423
01:15:44,546 --> 01:15:45,410
Scott: What about this game?

1424
01:15:45,570 --> 01:15:46,857
Scott: Have you played this specific thing?

1425
01:15:46,897 --> 01:15:50,702
Scott: and it's like no I haven't played that specific thing But you know those are.

1426
01:15:50,783 --> 01:15:51,590
Scott: those are not so bad.

1427
01:15:51,670 --> 01:15:52,554
Scott: That's like the average.

1428
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:54,703
Scott: that's a three star out of five star question.

1429
01:15:54,764 --> 01:15:55,969
Scott: Have you played this specific thing?

1430
01:15:56,049 --> 01:15:56,150
Rym: yep?

1431
01:15:56,390 --> 01:16:02,518
Rym: Though I will now take the opportunity to announce that at least as far as packs is concerned We are retiring beyond Dungeons & Dragons.

1432
01:16:02,538 --> 01:16:05,106
Rym: We've done it at three packs is we're not doing it there again.

1433
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:08,801
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I think as good as it is seriously.

1434
01:16:08,821 --> 01:16:10,468
Rym: We're gonna film it at some point.

1435
01:16:10,488 --> 01:16:10,970
Rym: We'll stick it up.

1436
01:16:11,010 --> 01:16:14,886
Rym: We'll probably end up doing it like magfest and things but no more packs.

1437
01:16:14,906 --> 01:16:15,810
Rym: We got to bring fresh stuff.

1438
01:16:16,191 --> 01:16:19,586
Rym: We might retire beyond Candyland and losing should be fun too.

1439
01:16:19,606 --> 01:16:20,590
Scott: I don't want to retire beyond Candyland.

1440
01:16:20,651 --> 01:16:22,270
Scott: I think that has like another year left.

1441
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:23,396
Rym: We'll see the.

1442
01:16:23,436 --> 01:16:24,000
Rym: the working title.

1443
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:25,830
Scott: People still need to play more German games.

1444
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:26,976
Scott: We can update it with some different games.

1445
01:16:26,996 --> 01:16:36,075
Rym: To tantalize two working titles I have for panels I'm slowly working on for future packs is our egregiously unrealized potential?

1446
01:16:36,095 --> 01:16:47,824
Rym: yeah, which is basically the Nintendo panel right and Games make the player hmm Some sort of mechanism design, but we have to not tread on Luke.

1447
01:16:47,944 --> 01:16:49,990
Scott: Luke cranes game is mind control panel.

1448
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:52,239
Rym: I think they can both exist in the same ecosystem.

1449
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:58,563
Rym: I'm not going to steal his hobbit example again Yeah, but we'll be using our DDR example.

1450
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:00,996
Scott: Which is almost the same thing I think.

1451
01:17:01,057 --> 01:17:08,552
Rym: one more thing that is worth mentioning It was pretty damn awesome was Scott having the balls to do the action castle thing in the first Q&A Balls.

1452
01:17:08,632 --> 01:17:09,235
Rym: it was easy.

1453
01:17:09,415 --> 01:17:13,090
Rym: I point out jerry did not have the testicular fortitude to do it himself.

1454
01:17:13,272 --> 01:17:14,565
Scott: He just didn't want to you know.

1455
01:17:14,585 --> 01:17:20,160
Scott: I asked him I'm like you sure you don't want to do it you sure and he just didn't want to be all Self-promotional and whatever at the same time.

1456
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,949
Rym: He was fine with you doing it.

1457
01:17:22,231 --> 01:17:23,498
Scott: He was fine with me doing it.

1458
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:25,730
Scott: apparently a lot of other people thought it was okay.

1459
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:30,110
Scott: I you know I didn't think it was that great when I was doing it or what you know.

1460
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:36,398
Scott: I thought it was oh, you know pretty clever, but it people were like oh, man I think part of it is that no one expected it.

1461
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:41,478
Rym: and every year like there are a few people who do something clever at The QA and no one you think about it.

1462
01:17:41,498 --> 01:17:44,470
Rym: in all these packs is no one thought to try to play a game with them.

1463
01:17:44,571 --> 01:17:46,006
Rym: Right there a short one mmm.

1464
01:17:46,551 --> 01:17:49,790
Rym: And also you know I think the fact that you didn't milk it that you stopped it at the appropriate time.

1465
01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:53,181
Scott: Well, I was planning to you know I knew that I had to keep it short right.

1466
01:17:53,542 --> 01:18:00,030
Scott: so I wanted to I wanted to you Know to cut it off at the appropriate time because if I stood there too long it'd be very bad.

1467
01:18:00,110 --> 01:18:01,997
Scott: It's a question-answer thing.

1468
01:18:02,037 --> 01:18:04,345
Rym: the genius of taiko that at the perfect moment.

1469
01:18:04,365 --> 01:18:05,870
Rym: He was like quit.

1470
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:07,757
Scott: Well, I don't think it was his genius right.

1471
01:18:07,777 --> 01:18:08,279
Scott: I think it was.

1472
01:18:08,299 --> 01:18:17,870
Scott: you know I I knew that Mike would not do Well right in advance, but I didn't know he would do that poorly and I sort of messed up right in that.

1473
01:18:18,232 --> 01:18:22,700
Scott: You know it wasn't his turn, but he kept thinking it was his turn And it's like oh what am I supposed to do?

1474
01:18:22,901 --> 01:18:23,645
Rym: you should have just either.

1475
01:18:23,665 --> 01:18:25,756
Rym: you could have kept saying I don't understand.

1476
01:18:25,836 --> 01:18:27,021
Rym: What the fuck do you want to me?

1477
01:18:27,041 --> 01:18:28,769
Rym: I don't come into your house and do this shit to you.

1478
01:18:30,452 --> 01:18:33,089
Scott: He didn't say that until after I told him it's not his turn.

1479
01:18:34,097 --> 01:18:34,630
Scott: You know Jared?

1480
01:18:34,771 --> 01:18:42,450
Scott: I think you know it could have been a little bit better because afterwards I asked Jared what I should have done And he said you should have said something along the lines of you know player one.

1481
01:18:42,691 --> 01:18:43,815
Scott: It is not your turn.

1482
01:18:44,096 --> 01:18:49,778
Scott: You know as opposed to saying you know it's not your turn You can't say anything if it's not your turn.

1483
01:18:49,818 --> 01:18:50,420
Scott: and like.

1484
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:53,977
Scott: the other thing is that Jerry just was not helping me out like he Thought it wasn't his turn.

1485
01:18:53,998 --> 01:18:55,107
Scott: He was just being all quiet.

1486
01:18:55,167 --> 01:18:58,470
Rym: because yeah I think he was I think he thought to say quit and he was just waiting for them.

1487
01:18:58,550 --> 01:19:06,415
Scott: No, no because if you if you actually look back at it You know Mike's like you know say whatever will make him stop, and then he says quit You know.

1488
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,643
Scott: so that that's what see.

1489
01:19:07,663 --> 01:19:08,630
Rym: the thing is with the showmanship.

1490
01:19:08,872 --> 01:19:15,170
Rym: I wonder how much of that was like the Unstated nod between the two of them that that interchange would have been a good joke and then they pulled it off.

1491
01:19:15,392 --> 01:19:21,042
Rym: I have no there's no way to know what those guys I got to admit those guys are getting pretty damn good at entertaining a crowd.

1492
01:19:21,223 --> 01:19:22,066
Scott: it is it is in.

1493
01:19:22,226 --> 01:19:24,718
Scott: it is difficult if nay Impossible to know.

1494
01:19:24,738 --> 01:19:26,590
Scott: so it doesn't really matter either.

1495
01:19:26,670 --> 01:19:30,909
Scott: It's just a silly action castle question whatever, but people liked it.

1496
01:19:31,812 --> 01:19:33,598
Scott: It made people excited for action castle.

1497
01:19:33,698 --> 01:19:34,661
Scott: action castle sold out.

1498
01:19:34,721 --> 01:19:36,186
Scott: it totally worked, so now.

1499
01:19:36,246 --> 01:19:44,109
Scott: I just have to think of Ways to promote whatever else I'm trying to sell at a Q&A without being blatantly self-promotional like you know.

1500
01:19:44,712 --> 01:19:47,350
Scott: Hey, everybody come over to my booth and buy my shit.

1501
01:19:47,571 --> 01:19:55,001
Rym: Well, I think the thing is PAX is special for now at least in that no Like attention-getting thing will ever work more than once.

1502
01:19:55,864 --> 01:20:03,876
Rym: I mean if someone does that which thing next year And no one's gonna stand for that, but doing every single thing once is awesome at PAX Except the knuckle crack.

1503
01:20:03,896 --> 01:20:06,607
Rym: that's gonna happen every goddamn year and luckily it did.

1504
01:20:06,648 --> 01:20:08,209
Scott: I was worried It wasn't gonna happen.

1505
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:09,655
Rym: I was gonna make it happen if it didn't.

1506
01:20:09,937 --> 01:20:11,925
Scott: someone came in and they saved the day.

1507
01:20:12,125 --> 01:20:15,240
Rym: that noise is just Surprisingly sickening.

1508
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:16,049
Scott: That's the greatest.

1509
01:20:17,470 --> 01:20:18,618
Rym: So we learned.

1510
01:20:18,638 --> 01:20:29,199
Rym: you know we had the vision like we talked about earlier And we failed to achieve the vision because we did not account for the immediate competence of the people Said it like doing the tag between.

1511
01:20:29,339 --> 01:20:32,974
Scott: I was you know I was worried that okay keynote ends There's gonna be applause.

1512
01:20:33,014 --> 01:20:37,650
Scott: you can't start until the applause and ends and people are sort of getting ready for the Q&A right.

1513
01:20:38,371 --> 01:20:45,169
Scott: But and I was like oh no there might be some sort of you know Rock and roll musics for a minute or two before they begin the Q&A.

1514
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:46,521
Scott: I'll have to overpower it.

1515
01:20:46,602 --> 01:20:50,930
Scott: so that was a challenge But that they would just start it right away immediately.

1516
01:20:51,352 --> 01:20:53,685
Scott: You know at the moment that I should have you know needed to start.

1517
01:20:53,705 --> 01:20:54,590
Rym: it was there was nothing.

1518
01:20:54,670 --> 01:20:56,717
Rym: It was no it was a foregone conclusion.

1519
01:20:57,178 --> 01:21:02,669
Scott: unless I suddenly gained the mutant powers of Banshee the x-man It was not gonna happen, but think about this.

1520
01:21:02,770 --> 01:21:04,939
Rym: This is like in the you know the Mario Party vision.

1521
01:21:05,481 --> 01:21:11,421
Rym: if you had the vision and you start the mat And there's already small mushrooms lined up all the way down.

1522
01:21:11,441 --> 01:21:14,390
Scott: That's pretty much it yeah, but we will reattempt.

1523
01:21:14,911 --> 01:21:21,148
Rym: We had another opportunity to test our theory and we now know that it is in fact solid gold.

1524
01:21:21,249 --> 01:21:21,650
Rym: it worked.

1525
01:21:22,012 --> 01:21:30,830
Rym: We were in line for the closing ceremonies the omega-thon finale And we were like right in the friggin front of the line like right where the people are who do the in-line entertainment.

1526
01:21:30,971 --> 01:21:32,883
Rym: I think it's step in line game something like that.

1527
01:21:33,407 --> 01:21:33,890
Rym: we talked to him.

1528
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:43,368
Rym: They're pretty cool people But they decided to have a dancing contest and they're like we need a guy and a girl and me and Scott look at each Other and we look at our friend Katsu.

1529
01:21:43,388 --> 01:21:45,816
Rym: and Scott starts yelling katsu.

1530
01:21:46,217 --> 01:21:46,599
Rym: katsu.

1531
01:21:46,679 --> 01:21:47,662
Rym: I was looking around.

1532
01:21:47,723 --> 01:21:49,810
Scott: I'm like oh, it's gotta be an FRC person.

1533
01:21:49,951 --> 01:21:51,505
Scott: I'm like who who who?

1534
01:21:53,130 --> 01:21:53,311
Scott: Katsu.

1535
01:21:53,953 --> 01:21:55,497
Rym: and Katsu looks up with this what?

1536
01:21:55,758 --> 01:21:57,142
Rym: and then you know the same thing.

1537
01:21:57,342 --> 01:21:58,365
Rym: I start yelling katsu.

1538
01:21:58,646 --> 01:22:00,150
Rym: Scott embraces my katsu.

1539
01:22:00,893 --> 01:22:01,957
Rym: Everyone else starts joining in.

1540
01:22:02,378 --> 01:22:04,426
Rym: the whole freaking line joins in.

1541
01:22:04,687 --> 01:22:11,910
Rym: people didn't even know his name - yeah - yeah - so you've got like thousands of people yelling katsu's name.

1542
01:22:12,211 --> 01:22:14,021
Rym: There's a circle formed around him, and he's screaming.

1543
01:22:14,081 --> 01:22:14,744
Rym: I swear to God.

1544
01:22:14,785 --> 01:22:16,352
Rym: I will kill you all Mm-hmm.

1545
01:22:16,874 --> 01:22:20,307
Rym: so of course he has to go up and do it and of course he wins.

1546
01:22:20,408 --> 01:22:24,401
Scott: of course That's why I wasn't gonna pick someone who was gonna fail.

1547
01:22:24,441 --> 01:22:25,485
Scott: I mean if I would have picked Rym.

1548
01:22:25,525 --> 01:22:29,302
Scott: It would have been like okay Not a winner fail.

1549
01:22:29,824 --> 01:22:31,753
Rym: I don't know if I could have won it But I katsu.

1550
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:34,704
Rym: if anyone could have won it it was katsu, and he did.

1551
01:22:34,724 --> 01:22:36,189
Scott: he won it by a zillion.

1552
01:22:36,209 --> 01:22:48,716
Scott: I Realized now that after having watched that college, and he got a free Cardboard to samurai figure which is a very expensive toy, but I saw it on eBay if I was him We have a terrible power.

1553
01:22:48,877 --> 01:22:55,326
Rym: if anyone wants to use this terrible power just watch that college humor We link to it works almost anywhere.

1554
01:22:55,608 --> 01:23:02,181
Rym: Yep So getting near the end I think we have to end on this because this was like the moment.

1555
01:23:02,863 --> 01:23:10,068
Rym: so in the line You know there's the line up room, which is something that anime cons could probably learn from.

1556
01:23:10,088 --> 01:23:14,170
Rym: of course I don't know if they could manage it the way packs does but regardless in the lineup room.

1557
01:23:14,632 --> 01:23:21,807
Rym: It's so happened that as we're all going into you know the biggest biggest event They started playing Bohemian Rhapsody just before the line went in.

1558
01:23:22,229 --> 01:23:24,328
Scott: yeah It's like the line is okay guys.

1559
01:23:24,429 --> 01:23:27,298
Scott: now You can start walking and then they play Bohemian Rhapsody.

1560
01:23:27,519 --> 01:23:31,050
Rym: so Bohemian Rhapsody is playing and you know people were singing along stuff already anyway.

1561
01:23:31,151 --> 01:23:40,130
Rym: So everyone in line starts singing Bohemian Rhapsody But the line goes past the monitors out the door down a long haul way off upstairs and everything.

1562
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:46,210
Rym: So as a result we're rapidly as a line leaving the already playing Bohemian Rhapsody.

1563
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:48,569
Scott: So we don't hear it being played anymore at all.

1564
01:23:48,811 --> 01:23:50,609
Scott: It's it's in another room far behind us.

1565
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:56,735
Rym: But the crowd kept singing it and kept singing it and kept singing it to a point That was scary.

1566
01:23:56,775 --> 01:23:59,330
Rym: like we're walking the music's long gone in the distance.

1567
01:24:00,010 --> 01:24:05,850
Rym: Everyone is still singing all the way through people who were kind of in the area like enforcers who saw the line coming.

1568
01:24:06,231 --> 01:24:11,756
Rym: They're looking up like are they singing Bohemian Rhapsody, and then I thought all right It's gonna die at the instrumental part.

1569
01:24:12,439 --> 01:24:13,262
Rym: It did not die.

1570
01:24:13,563 --> 01:24:20,550
Rym: people did the instrumental part and We made it all the way through and this is for the Saturday night concerts.

1571
01:24:20,693 --> 01:24:22,453
Rym: I believe yes I believe so.

1572
01:24:22,734 --> 01:24:26,466
Scott: and then right going into the closing ceremonies final omega-thon round.

1573
01:24:26,828 --> 01:24:28,815
Scott: it was repeated They did it again.

1574
01:24:28,835 --> 01:24:30,944
Rym: I think that is the PAX East thing.

1575
01:24:31,004 --> 01:24:31,225
Rym: now.

1576
01:24:31,285 --> 01:24:33,654
Rym: the Bohemian Rhapsody Continued meme.

1577
01:24:33,915 --> 01:24:36,423
Scott: yep it is now a tradition.

1578
01:24:36,564 --> 01:24:36,965
Rym: I mean there's a.

1579
01:24:37,025 --> 01:24:38,370
Scott: let it be set in the stone.

1580
01:24:38,631 --> 01:24:51,050
Rym: There is a point where it's fizzled out almost like everyone's kind of going you know But everyone's got it going in their head, and then someone comes out with the right timing.

1581
01:24:53,012 --> 01:24:54,076
Rym: It was so beautiful.

1582
01:24:54,096 --> 01:24:54,859
Rym: I could have cried.

1583
01:24:54,899 --> 01:25:07,605
Rym: that was that was a moment that deserved a man tear yeah, and then to cap off the whole week we had in Boston we get in the cab to go back to the airport and What plays on the radio, but Bohemian Rhapsody?

1584
01:25:07,625 --> 01:25:11,387
Scott: Yeah, that was kind of weird So I don't know.

1585
01:25:11,427 --> 01:25:16,631
Rym: in conclusion PAX East was 90 to 95 percent of the awesome that is PAX West.

1586
01:25:16,732 --> 01:25:16,972
Rym: it was.

1587
01:25:17,434 --> 01:25:27,304
Scott: the one thing at PAX East that really Got me compared to pretty much every other convention ever was that basically people were constantly coming up to me Yeah, being like hey.

1588
01:25:27,344 --> 01:25:28,709
Scott: Hey, it was like non-stop.

1589
01:25:28,729 --> 01:25:38,431
Scott: You know it was actually weird like I mean when I'm at conventions even PAX West Right you know some people come up, and they're like hey like hey, but it's not Right it's not like you know.

1590
01:25:38,451 --> 01:25:40,922
Scott: I mean this wasn't like this wasn't Celebrity

1591
01:25:40,942 --> 01:25:41,203
Scott: level

1592
01:25:41,223 --> 01:25:53,400
Scott: where you can't even move because there's people all around you like ah fuck, but it was like hey, man Hey, man, like every minute or two walking around people would be like hey, and it you know they was like wow okay?

1593
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:55,619
Scott: How many more people are gonna come up and say?

1594
01:25:57,062 --> 01:25:59,312
Rym: And everyone had like interesting questions or things to say.

1595
01:25:59,352 --> 01:26:00,377
Rym: or oh, would you try this game?

1596
01:26:00,417 --> 01:26:01,100
Rym: or yeah?

Rym: I bought burning wheel is freaking awesome, or hey, so how do you win jungle adventure?

1598
01:26:05,742 --> 01:26:08,339
Scott: Oh the other thing is that you know of course you know the.

1599
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:13,553
Scott: Usually when people come up to you at a con are like hey We should do X you know we should.

1600
01:26:13,634 --> 01:26:14,620

Scott: I want to do that.

1603
01:26:16,551 --> 01:26:20,707
Scott: usually it's like I really want to But it's just not gonna happen.

1604
01:26:20,727 --> 01:26:27,836
Scott: You know even a ConnectiCon there were like two people wanted to play burning wheel And I was like all right We'll make it happen show up here and whatever and then of course it just doesn't happen.

1605
01:26:27,856 --> 01:26:29,664
Scott: they disappear or something And you just can't.

1606
01:26:29,906 --> 01:26:30,590
Scott: they're strangers.

1607
01:26:30,610 --> 01:26:33,119
Scott: you don't meet up with them at the right time in the right place And it doesn't happen.

1608
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:35,350
Scott: Yeah, well think about no matter how much you try it doesn't happen.

1609

Rym: how much trouble we had meeting up with our friend at joystick Ever.

1610
01:26:38,043 --> 01:26:46,540
Scott: two packs is yeah, but you know even with all that we managed to meet up with everyone We had to meet up with except like two people, and I think we're still in contact with them.
