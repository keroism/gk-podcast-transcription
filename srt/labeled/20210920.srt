1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,708
Rym: It's Monday, September 20th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:09,909
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,064 --> 00:00:13,498
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,243
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,284 --> 00:00:22,260
Rym: Tonight we are talking about computer magazines and related ancient obsolete things.

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,757
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,121 --> 00:00:28,960
Rym: So yesterday, you know, it's GeekNights.

8
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:32,159
Rym: Often people make fun of us because it turns into Bike Nights.

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,100
Rym: Because in the beginning of the show we talk about what's going on in our lives and especially during COVID.

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,594
Rym: But for a long time before that, 90% of what happens in our lives that isn't part of GeekNights.

11
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:43,920
Rym: that we would talk about is something to do with the bike.

12
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:51,240
Scott: You know, we should just make Bike Nights, like make a bike, put it in the bike category and hope to get bike sponsors.

13
00:00:51,942 --> 00:00:56,240
Rym: We could replace our least popular day with bikes.

14
00:00:57,781 --> 00:00:58,743
Scott: We'll interview bike people.

15
00:00:58,763 --> 00:01:07,420
Scott: Let's just do the thing that podcasts are supposed to do, which is just be a media outlet that takes ads and gets sponsors and interviews people.

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,627
Rym: Oh, you mean the thing we avoided for so long?

17
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:13,540
Rym: The reason why GeekNights stayed at this very specific plateau of engagement?

18
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:14,802
Scott: Yeah, right.

19
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:17,250
Scott: Let's do the thing that you're just like a cookie cutter.

20
00:01:17,651 --> 00:01:20,059
Scott: What a podcast is supposed to do.

21
00:01:21,543 --> 00:01:23,172
Scott: Just to get free bike shit.

22
00:01:23,212 --> 00:01:24,680
Scott: Because right now it's hard to get bike shit.

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,426
Rym: I was about to say, that is a good angle.

24
00:01:27,507 --> 00:01:32,558
Rym: Because even with my contacts on the inside of some companies, nobody's sending me a 3080 right now.

25
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,300
Scott: We have no contacts in bike companies.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,344
Rym: Yeah, but we could just make bike content.

27
00:01:39,644 --> 00:01:42,970
Rym: So my idea was to revitalize.

28
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:48,159
Rym: an idea we brought off and on but never committed to was having the Friday GeekNights.

29
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:48,980
Rym: that is not regular.

30
00:01:49,563 --> 00:01:53,039
Rym: But whenever there's a Friday GeekNights, it's some special episode that we made.

31
00:01:54,601 --> 00:02:00,054
Rym: Like another topic, something that took research, an interview that was big, like a guest host.

32
00:02:00,334 --> 00:02:02,700
Rym: We could bring that back and then occasionally do a Friday Bike Nights.

33
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:06,044
Scott: I'm only doing that.

34
00:02:06,064 --> 00:02:07,747
Scott: I would only suggest that.

35
00:02:07,767 --> 00:02:09,991
Scott: I wouldn't even relate it to GeekNights.

36
00:02:10,092 --> 00:02:14,080
Scott: It would just be like the bike podcast with whatever.

37
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:18,094
Rym: Well the only way to go with our new website is to do the thing that our current website supports.

38
00:02:18,114 --> 00:02:19,940
Rym: but we've never used of having multiple shows.

39
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,450
Scott: Sure, but we don't have to integrate it with our current website.

40
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,260
Scott: We just make a brand new thing just to get free bike shit.

41
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,726
Rym: Oh yeah, I just want it to be in the same CMS because I'm lazy.

42
00:02:30,747 --> 00:02:37,940
Rym: And also I would interlink the branding a bit just because something nice is pretty good branding.

43
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,280
Scott: That would tarnish the brand though by having an ad thing.

44
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:44,889
Rym: No, because we were very clear from the beginning.

45
00:02:45,411 --> 00:02:49,020
Rym: GeekNights will never have an advertisement in it ever.

46
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:54,880
Scott: Right, so our website that says GeekNights at the top actually has this other podcast on it that's not related to GeekNights.

47
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,764
Rym: Oh no, you link to it and it goes to a different URL.

48
00:02:56,824 --> 00:02:58,186
Rym: Bike Nights something.

49
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:03,356
Rym: We never said that the front row crew umbrella would never have ads.

50
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:05,160
Rym: We only said GeekNights would never have ads.

51
00:03:05,401 --> 00:03:12,398
Rym: Anyway, so Emily and I went biking and we biked to Poughkeepsie a couple times.

52
00:03:12,418 --> 00:03:13,400
Rym: This is about a 100 mile ride.

53
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:19,840
Rym: So we decided to, because it's way more downhill coming back to New York City from Poughkeepsie.

54
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,060
Scott: I mean honestly it is more downhill coming back but it's not significantly upward downhill either way.

55
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,227
Rym: Well it's about a 1300 foot total climb going that way.

56
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:37,256
Rym: So coming back you climb about 700 feet but you descend about 1300 feet.

57
00:03:37,576 --> 00:03:40,080
Rym: So you have way more time when you're on a downhill than an uphill.

58
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:45,475
Scott: But that number of feet is a flat ride.

59
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,690
Rym: Because when I do a real ride it's like alright.

60
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,358
Rym: I climbed what, a mile and a half, two miles?

61
00:03:50,378 --> 00:03:50,499
Rym: Okay.

62
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:58,680
Rym: So we did the opposite direction partly because we have to decide where the two hour train ride is.

63
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,460
Rym: And it's either in the early morning when I fall asleep on the train and then wake up fresh in Poughkeepsie.

64
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:15,720
Rym: Or it's at the very end of a 100 mile ride and now I have to drag myself onto a train and if I miss it I'm fucked for two hours and get back to Grand Central at like 11 o'clock at night.

65
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:18,651
Scott: Alright so here for measure right.

66
00:04:18,771 --> 00:04:21,000
Scott: also this ride is also not a big climb.

67
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:29,940
Scott: I went from my house to up Bear Mountain on the west side then over the Bear Mountain Bridge then to Cold Spring and then took the train home.

68
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,269
Scott: That was only 78 miles total and it was 4,500 almost feet of climbing.

69
00:04:44,821 --> 00:04:48,200
Scott: And that's not a big climb so a thousand is basically flat.

70
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,360
Rym: So anyway we do the bike ride and so the last time, I think I even talked about this on GeekNights, we were up there.

71
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:04,160
Rym: We biked to Poughkeepsie and we thought oh we'll bike over that bridge that goes over the Hudson and then we'll declare victory, bike back over the bridge and get some food and take the train home.

72
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:10,660
Rym: And the bridge was closed for a private event with no detour and no way to get a bike across that bridge.

73
00:05:11,181 --> 00:05:21,980
Rym: Despite the fact that that bridge is part of the New York State Empire Trail that is supposedly part of our infrastructure and the governor encourages people to use it for long bike travel.

74
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,300
Scott: I haven't heard the new governor say anything about it.

75
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,369
Rym: Well the old governor said it.

76
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:26,559
Rym: The new governor hasn't said shit about it.

77
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,959
Rym: So they closed it for a private event which super fucks anyone who actually may...

78
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:35,247
Scott: Also private event on public property is the only...

79
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:47,320
Rym: In advance, I did look, I found their website for that bridge and I looked at it to see if there were any events that would block it.

80
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,618
Rym: And the website said there is an event that blocks the bridge yesterday until 1030 in the morning.

81
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,956
Rym: Which wouldn't have mattered because we weren't going over the bridge anyway.

82
00:05:56,976 --> 00:05:57,580
Rym: but I just wanted to know.

83
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,059
Scott: Why are there so many events on this bridge?

84
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,580
Rym: Because the upstate New York is trying to capitalize on this giant infrastructure park project that they got.

85
00:06:05,526 --> 00:06:05,796
Scott: I don't know.

86
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:07,587
Rym: Local politicians strutting their stuff.

87
00:06:07,627 --> 00:06:07,989
Rym: So whatever.

88
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,540
Rym: We get up there and guess what?

89
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,084
Rym: Both directions are closed.

90
00:06:12,124 --> 00:06:16,300
Rym: In fact, the entire Dutchess County Trailway is closed.

91
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,679
Scott: For what reason?

92
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,938
Rym: They were running... Poughkeepsie was running a foot race there.

93
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,487
Rym: They closed the whole thing.

94
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:25,240
Rym: There were cops blocking the entrance.

95
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:27,553
Rym: So we pull up and the cops are like, "You can't go in

96
00:06:27,573 --> 00:06:27,734
Rym: there.".

97
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:28,600
Rym: And they're like a little aggro.

98
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:29,951
Rym: So I'm like, "Alright, is there a

99
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:30,416
Rym: detour?".

100
00:06:31,004 --> 00:06:31,186
Rym: "No.

101
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:31,491
Rym: No

102
00:06:31,532 --> 00:06:31,938
Rym: detour.".

103
00:06:32,303 --> 00:06:33,154
Rym: "Is there any other

104
00:06:33,195 --> 00:06:33,479
Rym: path?".

105
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:33,864
Rym: "Nope.

106
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:34,250
Rym: No other

107
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:34,554
Rym: path.".

108
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,668
Rym: Where does the race end?

109
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:37,953
Rym: No one could tell us.

110
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:39,018
Rym: There was no map.

111
00:06:39,058 --> 00:06:39,540
Rym: There was nothing.

112
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,973
Rym: So now we're in Poughkeepsie, planning to bike 105 miles to Queens.

113
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:52,020
Rym: And the only path that is good to go through that area is closed for an indeterminate distance for like four hours.

114
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,308
Rym: There's no way to know this in advance.

115
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,380
Rym: There's no unified website you can go to for this.

116
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,060
Rym: Like a highway, if it's closed, by law, there's a detour.

117
00:07:02,461 --> 00:07:03,719
Rym: That's just how infrastructure works.

118
00:07:04,001 --> 00:07:10,700
Rym: In Queens, if they close the bike path on the Queensborough Bridge because it's open 24/7, they run a shuttle to take your bikes back and forth.

119
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,119
Rym: So you can still use it at 3am if you really want to.

120
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:27,000
Rym: Yet this infrastructure bike path that goes from New York up to Poughkeepsie and ostensibly all the way across to fucking Buffalo, Shiddo towns can just close it without telling anyone for no reason and just screw anyone who happens to be on a long bike ride.

121
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:31,120
Scott: Well, I don't disagree at all with anything that you just said.

122
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:42,740
Scott: I do just want to point out, you know, this is somewhat of an apt punishment because you're so obstinate and only willing to bike on this one place and not biking anywhere else.

123
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,708
Scott: You just come and bike where I bike.

124
00:07:44,929 --> 00:07:47,280
Scott: I never have these problems because I go on roads.

125
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:59,580
Rym: Because we couldn't use the bike path up there, my plan was we took normal country highway roads, the ones you described, just like across and around to where we figured there's no way that race is that far out.

126
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,264
Rym: And we were correct.

127
00:08:00,284 --> 00:08:03,059
Rym: We actually got back on the bike path like right after the race.

128
00:08:03,301 --> 00:08:03,850
Scott: Well, it's a foot race.

129
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,419
Scott: How far could it be?

130
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:04,460
Scott: 5k?

131
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,175
Rym: There was a marathon that was part of it.

132
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,900
Scott: Okay, but I'm sure the marathon wasn't, they weren't closing off marathon levels of track.

133
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,780
Rym: I mean, even if they did, the direction we went, we can bike 26 miles on regular country roads.

134
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,640
Rym: So we had numerous cars honk at us, freak out at us for being on the road.

135
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:32,679
Rym: And at one of them, the lady got so freaked out and aggressive that I videoed her and I even tweeted about it, chasing me, gunning her car at me, screaming at me and honking because I was a bike on the road.

136
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,142
Scott: I don't have these.

137
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:37,720
Scott: I mean, that's definitely a thing that happens, but I have video of it that often.

138
00:08:38,302 --> 00:08:42,179
Scott: The last time it happened to me was the guy who was just, he wasn't actually angry.

139
00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:44,148
Scott: He was riding in the bike lane, right?

140
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:46,779
Scott: He wasn't angry yet until I stopped and prevented him.

141
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,051
Rym: Yeah, that guy.

142
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:49,963
Scott: Yeah, that guy.

143
00:08:50,023 --> 00:08:54,920
Scott: So before that guy, I can't remember the last time somebody was aggressive to me.

144
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:01,660
Scott: And I think the reason is, you know, not only am I biking on roads, right, but I'm biking on roads with lots of cyclists, right?

145
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,340
Scott: I'm biking on the roads that are popular with the New York cycling people, right?

146
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:13,756
Scott: It's like they know where to go, the hot places, right, that are friendly, that have rest stops, that are, you know, businesses that are friendly, let cyclists come in and eat and pee, right?

147
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,800
Rym: Yeah, but see, I don't want any of those things.

148
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,680
Scott: I want a flat tire, 10 people stop and try to help you.

149
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,683
Rym: See, I don't want any of that.

150
00:09:19,724 --> 00:09:24,380
Rym: I really like solo travel and I really like to be able to ride on any road.

151
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,640
Rym: Except, obviously, grade separated freeways.

152
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:28,077
Scott: I mean, ideally.

153
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:36,359
Rym: Though, in Australia, you can bike on the grade separated freeways because they have bike lanes because they're not a barbaric country like the US is.

154
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,120
Scott: I was saying, you know, just giving things the way they are, right?

155
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:52,040
Scott: Riding where it's popular with cyclists to ride is a good idea and you should be more open to doing that and come with me at least one time instead of just always riding on the same path every single time and not going anywhere else.

156
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,660
Rym: So, how many times do you think we've ridden that ride?

157
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,700
Scott: Like, four maybe this year?

158
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:56,981
Scott: No, three.

159
00:09:57,183 --> 00:10:00,340
Rym: Twice up and then we did once back just to see what it was like in reverse.

160
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,460
Rym: But also, more to the point, I just don't- What other long rides did you do this year?

161
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,880
Rym: Big ones around the city, like out to the Rockaways and around and back, that Queens Boulevard goes way out.

162
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,860
Scott: But anywhere outside of the five boroughs that wasn't on that path.

163
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,460
Rym: I hate biking on country roads and I avoid them.

164
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,760
Scott: But you haven't done it, apparently.

165
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,480
Rym: No, because they suck and I hate riding on them.

166
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:24,618
Scott: Maybe you should come and bike where it's popular with cyclists to ride outside the city where you've never been and don't know how it is.

167
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:25,320
Scott: That's all I'm saying.

168
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:27,140
Rym: Nah, I'm saying that doesn't seem worth it.

169
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,219
Scott: One time, just come one time.

170
00:10:28,742 --> 00:10:31,060
Rym: I did, on the Harlow County Rail Ride, which I'll do every year.

171
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,523
Scott: That is not what I'm talking about.

172
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:38,800
Scott: I'm talking about going over the George Washington Bridge to New Jersey and then crossing the border into New York again.

173
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:44,340
Rym: The times I biked over there has not been super pleasant compared to a nice, lush, wooded path.

174
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:46,415
Scott: I think you just don't know where you're going over there.

175
00:10:46,435 --> 00:10:47,040
Scott: You ever been on Piermont?

176
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,566
Rym: Yeah, all the time.

177
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,250
Rym: Just not biking.

178
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:50,840
Rym: Biking around Bear Mountain sounds like it sucks.

179
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,362
Scott: It doesn't suck.

180
00:10:52,382 --> 00:10:52,803
Scott: You should come.

181
00:10:52,863 --> 00:10:54,428
Scott: It's very popular with cyclists.

182
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,675
Scott: The terrain is much more interesting.

183
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,180
Scott: It's much more hilly.

184
00:10:58,981 --> 00:10:59,303
Rym: Hilly?

185
00:10:59,363 --> 00:11:00,269
Rym: That doesn't sound like fun.

186
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:01,940
Rym: I'd rather be climbing and hiking there.

187
00:11:03,101 --> 00:11:03,324
Scott: Okay.

188
00:11:03,365 --> 00:11:03,507
Scott: Alright.

189
00:11:04,661 --> 00:11:05,940
Rym: I go to Bear Mountain to hike and climb.

190
00:11:06,842 --> 00:11:10,420
Scott: Yeah, I'm climbing with a machine that makes climbing much more efficient.

191
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,029
Rym: Yeah, and kind of boring.

192
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:12,795
Rym: Anyway...

193
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:16,108
Scott: And, here, I can sell you on this.

194
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:20,119
Scott: If I'm trying to actually sell you on it, here's how I can sell you on it.

195
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:21,948
Scott: Big, fast downhill.

196
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:23,539
Scott: Several of them.

197
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,125
Scott: Woosh.

198
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:24,897
Scott: You get to woosh.

199
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,340
Rym: There's plenty of those, actually.

200
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,660
Scott: You get to woosh so much that I think it's dangerous and I'll go slow.

201
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,440
Rym: Actually, there are plenty of those on the bike path to Poughkeepsie.

202
00:11:33,281 --> 00:11:34,125
Rym: No, there are not.

203
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:35,470
Scott: I've taken the path to Poughkeepsie.

204
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:37,700
Scott: There are no wooshes like there are on the other side of the river.

205
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,754
Rym: If you come back in the opposite direction, there are some ones.

206
00:11:39,794 --> 00:11:42,045
Rym: I've gotten up to 45.

207
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:42,432
Scott: Yeah, I mean...

208
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,919
Rym: I mean, granted, I get up at 45 going over the Queensborough Bridge, so...

209
00:11:46,941 --> 00:11:47,162
Scott: Yeah.

210
00:11:47,182 --> 00:11:50,940
Scott: You should see the steepness of some of these downs that are going on over there.

211
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,899
Scott: Of course, then on the way home, you gotta do up.

212
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:53,450
Scott: Yeah.

213
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,540
Scott: Which is what I prefer, but, you know.

214
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:09,080
Rym: So, in some news, there was a news back in July that we didn't really talk about and it escalated and it looks like the conclusion happened and there's updates, so we can speak about it now.

215
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:14,420
Rym: Partly because I forgot about it until recently and partly because we seem to know the full story, or at least most of the story.

216
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:25,960
Rym: So there was a story in late June where people all over America, and possibly globally, discovered that if they had a Western Digital in my book, it was just deleted.

217
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,109
Rym: All their data was gone.

218
00:12:27,554 --> 00:12:28,080
Rym: Unrecoverable.

219
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,939
Scott: Oh yeah, this happened like a while ago.

220
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,460
Rym: So it kept happening and lots of people just lost all their data, got completely fucked by this.

221
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:47,516
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I have a little Western Digital passport, single magnetic spinning drive with a USB 3 cable, but I don't use it for saving stuff.

222
00:12:47,676 --> 00:12:49,920
Scott: I use it for a big transfer.

223
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:59,600
Scott: Or if I go on a trip, such that my SD cards need to be emptied, but I'm not bringing a computer with me, right?

224
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:06,680
Scott: I'll copy the SD cards to it, then erase the SD cards so I can keep taking more photos and videos and filling that thing up.

225
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,540
Scott: And then as soon as I get home, I empty that thing onto the NAS, which is much safer.

226
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:18,000
Rym: So, in some updates, what seemed to be happening, like Western Digital, they gave advice to customers to unplug these devices or you're going to lose all your data.

227
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,025
Rym: So, alright, something was going on there.

228
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:28,440
Rym: Could have been fucked up hardware, could have been firmware, could have been a bad update, like they pushed out an update to these devices, could have been hackers.

229
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:30,377
Scott: Could have been user error.

230
00:13:31,863 --> 00:13:34,920
Rym: Yeah, so in this case, definitely not user error, even from the initial reports.

231
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,352
Scott: I'm just saying, it's always a possibility.

232
00:13:36,373 --> 00:13:37,220
Scott: I'm not saying that's what it was.

233
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,343
Rym: It was just too widespread.

234
00:13:39,505 --> 00:13:45,560
Rym: So, early reports were that it only affected people who used the Western Digital Cloud stuff, but then it was clear.

235
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,449
Scott: I don't use any of that shit.

236
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:47,320
Rym: I treat it like a drug.

237
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,307
Rym: Not using it did not protect you at all.

238
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:52,760
Rym: In fact, if you didn't set up any of that stuff, it could still happen.

239
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,511
Rym: So, fast forward to now, there's an update.

240
00:13:57,772 --> 00:14:00,620
Rym: I'll link to an article that was posted toward the end of June.

241
00:14:01,463 --> 00:14:02,920
Scott: Someone tore one down and figured it out.

242
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:09,600
Rym: So, basically, there were multiple things going on, and the story is way more nuts than you might have expected.

243
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:17,940
Rym: So, people were assuming, there was a zero-day exploit in a bunch of Western Digital stuff, and people thought that's what they were exploiting.

244
00:14:18,642 --> 00:14:25,960
Rym: It turns out there was an even older bug from 2018 that had just been unpatched up until 2021.

245
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,240
Rym: Both were involved, and the long story... You can read this article that'll go into way depth.

246
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:31,610
Rym: I'm not going to give you the play-by-play.

247
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,900
Rym: It's just too long and complicated.

248
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:47,760
Rym: But it seems like there's one set of hackers who might have done an inside job at Western Digital to get someone in Western Digital to comment out the code that checked that someone had provided a real password.

249
00:14:48,123 --> 00:14:49,899
Rym: Before allowing a factory reset.

250
00:14:52,421 --> 00:14:58,160
Rym: Like, there's a snippet of a code that someone commented out, and that just got distributed to all Western Digital devices.

251
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:13,940
Rym: But, separately, it appears that a different hacking group, either to attack that first hacking group, or, as an unrelated consequence, went after the same devices and triggered the data wipes for unknown reasons.

252
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,963
Rym: And this is a crazy complicated story.

253
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:38,860
Rym: The only real takeaway I have for all of you is, never, ever, ever, ever, even though this wouldn't necessarily have protected you in this case, buy consumer-grade storage hardware and connect it to the internet in any way that allows you to access your data outside of your own home.

254
00:15:39,181 --> 00:15:40,578
Rym: You cannot trust this stuff.

255
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:53,580
Scott: Even my NAS, which is a pretty fancy Synology NAS, they're very trustworthy and such, the NAS has these features that let you access the NAS from far away.

256
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,280
Scott: So that way you can send or get files to a friend.

257
00:15:57,022 --> 00:16:04,220
Rym: Oh, my NAS can get out of my network to get to the Synology site to download updates and has no other access to the world.

258
00:16:05,141 --> 00:16:11,337
Scott: Yep, and there's features that let you use Synology cloud services and things to integrate with your NAS and whatnot.

259
00:16:11,397 --> 00:16:12,660
Scott: I didn't use any of that.

260
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,480
Rym: Oh, no, my NAS can also connect to Amazon Glacier to upload my weekly sync backup.

261
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:26,773
Scott: Sure, but it's like, yeah, my NAS doesn't have any more, there's no way to access my NAS from outside, right?

262
00:16:27,013 --> 00:16:27,875
Scott: It's the same way.

263
00:16:27,895 --> 00:16:29,918
Scott: you can't access my computer from the outside.

264
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:30,780
Scott: It's a one-way street.

265
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:39,797
Rym: But more importantly, you have to have an offline backup of your data, because even the advice we just gave you might not have protected you from this Western Digital thing.

266
00:16:39,857 --> 00:16:41,320
Rym: Like, this is a fucked up story.

267
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,300
Scott: Right, well, my NAS is the offline backup, right?

268
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:56,360
Rym: Yep, but as in, you really should have, even if you have a NAS or a SAN, you should have another copy of that data, even if it's not refreshed that often, that is completely offline, as in, it is powered off somewhere.

269
00:16:57,703 --> 00:16:59,859
Scott: I mean, I guess if it really needed to.

270
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,880
Rym: Yeah, I mean, how I do that is I put it on Glacier, so there's an encrypted blob of all the data.

271
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,520
Scott: Well, that's cloud, that's not offline.

272
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:13,239
Rym: It is cloud, but it serves the purpose of an offline backup, because say, somehow, malware- It's not an offline backup at all.

273
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,420
Rym: What do you mean?

274
00:17:14,681 --> 00:17:15,819
Scott: It's very online.

275
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:20,209
Rym: That's not what most professionals mean in Myspace, at least by offline backup.

276
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,839
Rym: They usually mean the data is inaccessible to the applications that use it and inaccessible to other systems.

277
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:30,140
Scott: Yeah, that's true, but it's not offline like a hard drive in a drawer that's not powered on.

278
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,114
Rym: Yeah, because that is a somewhat archaic backup strategy at this point.

279
00:17:34,134 --> 00:17:35,820
Rym: I mean, maybe consumers don't have a lot of data.

280
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,020
Scott: Well, it could be useful for your most important shit.

281
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:48,860
Rym: Yeah, what I do is the NAS just has it synced to Amazon Glacier, so say something got into my environment and wiped or encrypted all the data on my NAS and my hard drives and everything.

282
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,400
Scott: It could get your Glacier credentials from the NAS and then wipe that.

283
00:17:53,422 --> 00:17:55,090
Rym: I don't think the way it set up it actually could.

284
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,339
Rym: If they compromised my NAS to that degree...

285
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,040
Scott: I guess it's not impossible.

286
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:01,893
Rym: Yeah.

287
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,020
Scott: But nobody can get into your hard drive in a drawer.

288
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,979
Rym: I mean, that is true.

289
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:07,960
Scott: Hard drive in a fireproof box.

290
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:17,340
Rym: Though, I have so much data on that NAS that the only way to have a completely offline local physical backup would be to have another NAS of the same size.

291
00:18:17,821 --> 00:18:18,770
Scott: Yup, exactly.

292
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,779
Scott: That's why I don't have one.

293
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,627
Rym: Way back, we thought about doing that.

294
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,780
Rym: We both buy the same NAS and agree to back each other up, but we just never bought it.

295
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,969
Scott: If I had a lot of money, sure.

296
00:18:28,254 --> 00:18:29,138
Scott: I could get whatever.

297
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:29,559
Scott: Anyway...

298
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,860
Rym: But anyway, do not put all your stuff on one hard drive you bought from Western Digital.

299
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:39,136
Scott: I think just don't use the net features of your NAS.

300
00:18:39,236 --> 00:18:40,380
Scott: Keep your NAS on your LAN.

301
00:18:42,242 --> 00:18:51,480
Scott: If you need to connect to get your files while you're out of the house, then you should mirror the files onto a service, like a Dropbox or a Google Docs or something like that.

302
00:18:52,401 --> 00:18:52,601
Scott: Yup.

303
00:18:52,782 --> 00:19:03,340
Rym: Along those lines, Western Digital had some other bad news in August, a little under a month ago, where they have some NVMe solid state drives.

304
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,070
Rym: The ones you plug into your M.2 slot.

305
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,760
Rym: These super fast hard drives.

306
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:17,920
Rym: But they had a SKU, an SKU, a unique product that they sold, that achieved a certain level of performance, benchmarked by third parties to that level of performance.

307
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,780
Rym: A Western Digital Blue budget SSD, and it was fine.

308
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:30,780
Rym: Without telling anyone, except burying it deep in their update text, like a changelog that literally no human on Earth will ever read.

309
00:19:32,661 --> 00:19:40,020
Rym: It looks like they changed the hardware to be slightly shittier, and they changed the firmware to drastically reduce the performance of these things.

310
00:19:41,022 --> 00:19:43,840
Rym: And they didn't tell anyone, and kept selling them under the same model number.

311
00:19:45,544 --> 00:19:46,006
Scott: Yup.

312
00:19:46,127 --> 00:19:48,459
Scott: I think we've talked about this before, because they've done similar things.

313
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,099
Rym: Oh, this has happened so many times.

314
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,409
Scott: Yeah, there's been similar stories with this, with the shingled storage on the magnetic drive, something like that.

315
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:08,440
Rym: Oh yeah, the shingled storage that is, for some kinds of consumers, doesn't matter, but for someone like us, is a fatal performance hit.

316
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:18,200
Scott: Yeah, so it's like they keep doing this, and I really don't understand it at all, because all you have to do to avoid the bad attention...

317
00:20:18,705 --> 00:20:20,040
Rym: Change the model number slightly.

318
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,380
Scott: Just change the model number, you know, to something different, so that there's no confusion and no shenanigans.

319
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:29,160
Rym: Ah, because you know, we both know, they are banking on that confusion.

320
00:20:30,722 --> 00:20:43,497
Scott: Right, but it's like, anyone who cares and notices, right, is gonna... Right, it's like, you're not fooling them by not changing the model number.

321
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:44,220
Scott: You got caught.

322
00:20:44,421 --> 00:20:49,560
Scott: Anyone who's smart enough to care and notice about it, right, is gonna catch you, and it's not gonna work.

323
00:20:49,940 --> 00:21:01,718
Scott: And anyone who doesn't give a shit, because they're just like, I just need a hard drive for my computer, they're not looking up stuff like this, they'll just buy, you change the model number, fine, they'll just buy that new model number, even though it's crappier, they don't know

324
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:02,280
Rym: or care.

325
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,560
Rym: No, I've run into this with, so when I got my max mixer...

326
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:19,000
Scott: You don't lose anything by making the new model number, but by trying to pull shenanigans that are so obvious and easily caught, just hurts you and makes people say, well, fuck you Western Digital, I'll go buy from someone else, because clearly you're just trying to be evil for no reason.

327
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:37,200
Rym: So for both my max mixer and that DVD player that we bought, that I brought to RIT, there was a situation where the SKU was the same, but depending on other factors that you could try to suss out from the serial numbers, there were fundamentally different components that behaved differently in those devices.

328
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:55,600
Rym: And I remember, I was trying to get the Mackie mixer that was made after a certain date, because it literally just had more features for the same price, and there is no way to know which one you're getting, except by complete luck, or buying one used, and I think that kind of thing should be straight up illegal.

329
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:05,820
Scott: Yep, I definitely think, you know, this is a thing that happens, you know, here we have Western Digital doing it for intentional deception purposes, at least by all evidence.

330
00:22:06,081 --> 00:22:07,509
Rym: Oh, I'm considering their statement.

331
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:09,760
Rym: at the end, I'll read Western Digital's statement.

332
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:25,059
Rym: "For greater transparency going forward, if we make a change to an existing and internal SSD, we commit to introducing a new model number whenever any related published specifications are

333
00:22:25,139 --> 00:22:25,620
Rym: impacted.".

334
00:22:26,421 --> 00:22:28,460
Rym: Props to the lawyer who wrote that statement.

335
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:37,240
Scott: Anyway, but here we have what appears to be intentional deception, but very often, this is just a thing that happens, right?

336
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:42,900
Scott: Like, if you were in the 80s and you went to go buy Zelda 1 on a cartridge, there were like two different versions of that.

337
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:52,320
Scott: At some point, they changed it slightly, and they didn't tell you on the cartridge that this is Zelda 1.1, or whatever the heck the number was.

338
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:58,920
Rym: That just fucking didn't do macrovision, and I had an identical VCR that did do macrovision.

339
00:23:00,682 --> 00:23:04,098
Rym: I would have paid a lot to get that non-macrovision one had I known that was an option.

340
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:10,477
Scott: Yeah, and a lot of times you can look up online, you know, my Apple IIGS, right?

341
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:11,400
Scott: It's an old computer.

342
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:19,316
Scott: There are like several different board revisions for the Apple IIGS, like three, but if you went to go buy an Apple IIGS in 1986, or '87, you didn't know which one.

343
00:23:21,481 --> 00:23:24,396
Scott: Apple didn't say, like, "Oh, Apple IIGS now, better, different

344
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:24,757
Scott: board.".

345
00:23:24,818 --> 00:23:25,260
Scott: It's like, it was--.

346
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:40,340
Rym: Well, in fact, these kinds of stealth updates, like, if a company is going to make a stealth update, even if it's for completely benign, normal reasons, if there's any difference in performance at all, they definitely really don't want consumers to know, because they definitely want to be able to sell all their remaining inventory.

347
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:46,078
Rym: Like, look at Nintendo, people are like, "Ooh, I want to get the later Switch, because XYZ changes that--".

348
00:23:46,781 --> 00:23:49,988
Scott: Well, Nintendo is telling everyone, right?

349
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:55,060
Scott: So they're not, like, hiding it, so for them it's an intentional move where one costs more than the other.

350
00:23:55,962 --> 00:23:57,140
Scott: It's not like the same price.

351
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:12,299
Rym: But suppose they didn't cost more, and there was no way to distinguish them, if consumers know about it, even if the change doesn't affect them, they will tend to want the newer, better one, just because, "Why get an inferior thing if I know for sure that they're

352
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:12,580
Rym: different?".

353
00:24:15,001 --> 00:24:19,260
Rym: But Western Digital really just kind of has shit the bed on a lot of these issues lately.

354
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,870
Rym: I will say that, other than my spinning disks, I don't use any Western Digital hard drives.

355
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:32,134
Rym: I actually went full Samsung, because in the year 2021-- All my SSDs and M2 drives are Samsung.

356
00:24:32,194 --> 00:24:36,030
Rym: My magnetic disks-- Mine are all Western Digital and my spinning disks.

357
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,740
Rym: They're all reds in the NAS, and they're blacks.

358
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,610
Scott: I don't know what happened to Seagate.

359
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:40,992
Scott: Who knows?

360
00:24:41,072 --> 00:24:43,768
Scott: I gotta do research again to figure out-- We figured out what happened to Seagate.

361
00:24:43,788 --> 00:24:45,760
Rym: We talked about it on GeekNights, but I forgot.

362
00:24:45,963 --> 00:24:46,135
Scott: I forgot.

363
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,063
Rym: I also forget.

364
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:51,180
Rym: Finding GeekNights from, like, 2008, and you'll figure out why Seagate sucks now.

365
00:24:55,491 --> 00:24:55,959
Rym: Some other news?

366
00:24:57,061 --> 00:24:57,261
Scott: Yep.

367
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:10,174
Scott: So, if you're from the UK, which I am not, but I've gathered from the internet and from other UK peoples, that in the UK, you know, gaming consoles were never like a big thing.

368
00:25:10,194 --> 00:25:11,880
Scott: It was definitely a PC kind of place.

369
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:21,180
Scott: And they had, like, a different sort of, you know, the way that Japan has, like, a different PC history with things like, you know, the MSX and whatnot, and the FM Towns and all those things.

370
00:25:21,582 --> 00:25:23,719
Scott: The UK had its own sort of PC history.

371
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:31,219
Scott: They didn't have Commodore 64, Apple II the way we do in the-- I guess they might have had Commodore, but they didn't have Apple IIs, I think, the way we did in the US.

372
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:31,600
Scott: so much.

373
00:25:32,122 --> 00:25:34,614
Scott: The big thing over there was the ZX Spectrum, right?

374
00:25:34,654 --> 00:25:35,900
Scott: Not ZX, ZX, right?

375
00:25:37,001 --> 00:25:40,209
Scott: If you don't know what that is, if you see a picture of it, you'll know exactly what it is.

376
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:41,211
Scott: It's a little guy.

377
00:25:41,231 --> 00:25:44,700
Scott: It's like a keyboard, and you plug it into a TV, right?

378
00:25:45,421 --> 00:25:45,942
Scott: And there you go.

379
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:50,135
Scott: You got yourself a computer with a Z80 processor, and it was a lot of fun.

380
00:25:50,155 --> 00:25:51,599
Scott: You get games on there and shit, right?

381
00:25:52,502 --> 00:25:58,200
Scott: So the person who created that, it was, you know, it was the Sinclair, you know, ZX Spectrum.

382
00:25:58,761 --> 00:26:07,300
Scott: And the person who invented that was Sir Clive Marles Sinclair, who passed away four days ago.

383
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,745
Scott: So that's the news, right?

384
00:26:08,765 --> 00:26:10,009
Scott: This important computing guy.

385
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:13,020
Scott: I don't know if he was a good person or a bad person, because I don't know anything about him.

386
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:20,240
Scott: I didn't realize that Sinclair was actually, you know, I'm completely honest, I knew that it was the Sinclair ZX Spectrum.

387
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:25,598
Scott: I didn't know that there was a person Sinclair behind that until four or five days ago.

388
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:40,440
Scott: But yeah, the person passed away at the age of 81, which is interesting, because that means Sinclair, when he was making these computers in the early 80s, and we were born, he was as old then about-ish as we are now.

389
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,996
Rym: Well, it looks like he was doing radio kits in the 60s.

390
00:26:44,362 --> 00:26:46,707
Scott: Yeah, he was basically doing all kinds of interesting stuff.

391
00:26:46,727 --> 00:26:52,060
Scott: If you look through his history, making like electric vehicles, little bicycles, right?

392
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:58,936
Scott: Watches, calculators, like, you know, very much in the vein of like the Dyson guy, right?

393
00:26:58,976 --> 00:27:00,700
Scott: You know, making all sorts of stuff.

394
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:12,100
Scott: But the ZX Spectrum specifically was just a huge deal, you know, just as far as personal computing goes, you know, around the world.

395
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:18,071
Rym: The face he's making and the photo they put on this article, I feel like that's the face of a good person, but again, I don't know.

396
00:27:18,091 --> 00:27:21,798
Rym: I'm sure I'm going to find out when I Google later, but I hope not.

397
00:27:21,818 --> 00:27:22,520
Rym: I hope he's just cool.

398
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:23,701
Scott: Yeah.

399
00:27:24,983 --> 00:27:33,700
Scott: So yeah, but it's like, the ZX Spectrum is just a really interesting thing, is that only ever having used one for like moments at a time here and there, right?

400
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:40,000
Scott: You look at it, and I have a nostalgia for this thing that I've never owned and it touched maybe twice for a minute.

401
00:27:41,501 --> 00:27:46,060
Scott: But you just look at it and it's like, oh, this black keyboard with these colored stripes on it.

402
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:53,676
Rym: Well, because all those old computers, they remind me, like, there was an era in my life, because, you know, we were later, like the computer I had in my house as a kid was a 486 SX2.

403
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,385
Rym: But there was that era where computers weren't connected to anything yet.

404
00:27:59,906 --> 00:28:09,800
Rym: And you could really just, as a kid, a computer was just a box of magic fun, but it didn't really matter what power or capabilities the computer had.

405
00:28:10,181 --> 00:28:12,486
Rym: And the fact that you had a computer at all was a big deal.

406
00:28:12,587 --> 00:28:15,955
Rym: So the ZX Spectrum, kids in that era, just fuck around with it.

407
00:28:16,336 --> 00:28:18,080
Rym: Learn a lot about computers along the way.

408
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,700
Scott: And there were many, many choices too then, right, of completely different computers.

409
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:22,851
Scott: Yeah.

410
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:27,774
Scott: Not like, you know, by the 90s, it was like, okay, you bought a Compaq or an HP or a pack, you know, whatever.

411
00:28:30,221 --> 00:28:31,539
Rym: Packard pal is what we had.

412
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:32,821
Scott: Yeah.

413
00:28:32,901 --> 00:28:35,747
Scott: It's like, you know, or, uh, whatever you bought, right.

414
00:28:35,767 --> 00:28:41,840
Scott: An IBM, you know, it's like, yeah, they were not the same, but they all ran DOS and Windows.

415
00:28:42,143 --> 00:28:42,385
Rym: Yup.

416
00:28:42,405 --> 00:28:44,920
Scott: Like my 486 was- Unless you bought a Mac, that was different.

417
00:28:45,301 --> 00:28:48,816
Rym: My 486 was not different from any computer anyone else I knew had.

418
00:28:49,378 --> 00:28:51,649
Scott: Except- And that's how we're still in that situation today.

419
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:53,840
Scott: You're either buying a Windows computer or an Apple computer.

420
00:28:53,925 --> 00:28:54,060
Scott: Yup.

421
00:28:54,621 --> 00:28:59,029
Scott: In the 80s, there were a lot of choices that had nothing to do with each other.

422
00:28:59,109 --> 00:29:05,000
Scott: An Atari, a Commodore, a ZX Spectrum, an Apple, some kind of IBM XT something.

423
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:05,799
Scott: Yup, get a Tandy.

424
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:09,095
Scott: All these computers were super, yeah, they were super different.

425
00:29:09,235 --> 00:29:10,160
Scott: A Radio Shack Coco.

426
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,748
Scott: It's like, uh, you know, a TRS-80 or whatever.

427
00:29:14,768 --> 00:29:20,460
Scott: There's so many different computers, all with different chips, completely different software, completely incompatible in every way, right.

428
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:21,808
Scott: You learned how to use one.

429
00:29:21,828 --> 00:29:23,540
Scott: You didn't know how to shit how to use another one.

430
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,584
Scott: Nope.

431
00:29:25,467 --> 00:29:28,680
Rym: And sometimes you had to know about the hardware to make these things work, like directly.

432
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:29,880
Scott: Yup.

433
00:29:29,961 --> 00:29:34,886
Scott: And especially in the UK, this one, you know, this guy made the one that was the biggest deal.

434
00:29:34,926 --> 00:29:46,340
Scott: So this is almost like, you know, if Steve Jobs didn't turn Apple around and it died, and then he died, that's what this is like.

435
00:29:46,761 --> 00:29:48,444
Scott: This guy, he was the king in the 80s.

436
00:29:48,604 --> 00:29:51,089
Scott: So it was Steve Jobs, but Steve Jobs was the king again.

437
00:29:51,149 --> 00:29:53,473
Scott: This guy was not the king again, right.

438
00:29:53,593 --> 00:29:54,415
Scott: And then he died.

439
00:29:54,495 --> 00:29:57,000
Scott: So that's the level of this story that we're at here.

440
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,462
Rym: And one last little news.

441
00:29:58,482 --> 00:30:00,586
Rym: You might've seen us complaining about this on the internet.

442
00:30:01,547 --> 00:30:06,637
Rym: To make a long story short, Google has a thing that they launched a long time ago.

443
00:30:06,717 --> 00:30:08,320
Rym: It's changed names a bunch of times.

444
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,280
Rym: There's like, there's a whole, right now, right now, Dateline 2021 in September, it is Google Workspaces.

445
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:22,069
Scott: But, so yeah, originally the very first incarnation of it was called Gmail for your domain.

446
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:31,540
Scott: And the way it worked was you have a Gmail account and you, instead of it being at gmail.com, you just want to change it to be at the domain you registered.com.

447
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,922
Scott: So at frontrowcrew.com.

448
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:34,784
Scott: So we signed up for it then.

449
00:30:35,785 --> 00:30:45,858
Scott: And that's all it did in those days was just let you have at gmail.com and instead, you know, have a Gmail account, you log into google.com, but your email address is different.

450
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:47,580
Scott: That's the only feature it had originally.

451
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,005
Scott: And then they kept adding to it, right?

452
00:30:50,045 --> 00:30:56,620
Scott: So it was like a separate, special, different Google account that worked just like a regular Google account, but you could sort of administer it.

453
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,005
Scott: You could administer a group of accounts underneath your domain, right?

454
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:03,691
Scott: And they kept adding stuff to it, which wasn't always good and bad.

455
00:31:03,771 --> 00:31:09,520
Scott: Sometimes it was bad because like you couldn't access regular old Google services with your special account.

456
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,046
Scott: But eventually they sorted that out.

457
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,957
Scott: You know, I remember there were a lot of stuff with Google Plus.

458
00:31:14,058 --> 00:31:14,620
Scott: It got weird.

459
00:31:15,903 --> 00:31:19,160
Rym: But they sorted all out and then they started unsorting it again.

460
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:20,181
Scott: Right.

461
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:25,028
Scott: Well, they made it Google workspaces or Google apps or whatever.

462
00:31:25,048 --> 00:31:25,468
Scott: I don't know.

463
00:31:25,869 --> 00:31:34,280
Scott: And basically they changed it into a product for companies because most people who, you know, would have a domain instead of gmail.com would be companies.

464
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:41,530
Rym: Because as much as you might be thinking, oh, but like the original use case, what if a family wants to have their own domain?

465
00:31:41,931 --> 00:31:47,840
Rym: The reality is, imagine if your uncle Joey Jojo was the admin for your email.

466
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,180
Scott: Right.

467
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,652
Scott: There's all sorts of problems for families doing it because the admin can like read all the other priests people's email and share.

468
00:31:54,672 --> 00:31:55,474
Scott: You don't want to do that.

469
00:31:55,794 --> 00:31:58,380
Scott: Families, normal people can just use that gmail.com.

470
00:31:58,801 --> 00:32:01,205
Rym: But Scott and I, like technology wise, trust each other.

471
00:32:01,265 --> 00:32:04,531
Scott: So there's other benefits.

472
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:04,831
Scott: Right.

473
00:32:04,912 --> 00:32:06,074
Scott: It's like something happens to me.

474
00:32:06,274 --> 00:32:06,474
Scott: Right.

475
00:32:06,555 --> 00:32:09,620
Scott: Someone can get my, you know, you don't have to worry about things like that anyway.

476
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:15,300
Scott: But yeah, if it wasn't for that, I'd probably be using your regular old gmail like everyone else.

477
00:32:15,721 --> 00:32:19,540
Rym: There was a long time where regular old gmail had ads and shit that I had never seen in my life.

478
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:20,561
Scott: Yep.

479
00:32:20,761 --> 00:32:23,065
Scott: Well, it still has ads and shit we've never seen in our lives.

480
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:25,989
Scott: So anyway, it's a product now for companies.

481
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:32,880
Scott: If you start a company and you want to get email addresses that they charge you like X dollars per user per employee at your company base.

482
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,265
Rym: Like every convention you know about does this for their emails.

483
00:32:36,926 --> 00:32:37,427
Scott: Exactly.

484
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:45,260
Scott: However, what they've always done, which is good of them in some ways, is anyone who was on the old thing got grandfathered in.

485
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:45,761
Scott: So we don't have to.

486
00:32:45,901 --> 00:32:49,547
Scott: we have this and we don't have to pay for it because we signed up for it when it was new.

487
00:32:49,587 --> 00:32:51,130
Scott: There's no way we could sign up for it now.

488
00:32:51,551 --> 00:32:53,294
Scott: We didn't start GeekNights until today.

489
00:32:53,314 --> 00:32:54,536
Scott: It would be impossible.

490
00:32:54,997 --> 00:32:55,297
Scott: We could.

491
00:32:55,317 --> 00:32:57,000
Scott: we'd have to pay per user to get it.

492
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,643
Rym: Granted, I would probably pay.

493
00:32:58,824 --> 00:32:59,846
Rym: There are a lot of benefits.

494
00:32:59,866 --> 00:33:01,149
Scott: But we have a lot more users.

495
00:33:01,169 --> 00:33:02,232
Scott: So we have to kick other people off.

496
00:33:02,352 --> 00:33:02,513
Rym: Oh, yeah.

497
00:33:02,553 --> 00:33:03,194
Rym: I would have kicked almost.

498
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:05,640
Rym: I would have kicked everyone off or made them pay us for the privilege.

499
00:33:05,941 --> 00:33:06,161
Scott: Yeah.

500
00:33:06,241 --> 00:33:09,408
Scott: It would just be like us to paying ten, five, ten bucks a month each.

501
00:33:09,508 --> 00:33:15,300
Scott: I can't afford all the people we have on there and I don't think they would pay because it gets them nothing really.

502
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:21,990
Rym: But the problem that happened is that as a result, this is my Google account.

503
00:33:22,631 --> 00:33:25,836
Rym: And Google has started to fuck that up.

504
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:28,180
Rym: Like Google pages does not work with these things anymore.

505
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:28,641
Scott: Right.

506
00:33:28,661 --> 00:33:29,121
Scott: So what right.

507
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:30,323
Scott: So what happened with Google Pay?

508
00:33:30,443 --> 00:33:35,410
Scott: and to their credit, they only give you real tech support if you pay, which we don't.

509
00:33:35,871 --> 00:33:42,020
Scott: So but I was able to get real tech support for the Google Pay thing because it involved money because your Google Pay.

510
00:33:42,401 --> 00:33:42,641
Scott: Right.

511
00:33:42,701 --> 00:33:48,151
Scott: So and they get the tech support person gave me straight answers, detailed answers.

512
00:33:48,191 --> 00:33:53,200
Scott: And what they basically said was like, look, we had the old Google Pay and you could use that with your account.

513
00:33:53,781 --> 00:34:02,874
Scott: But with the new Google Pay, we can't let you use that with your account because security wise, if you're controlling the DNS on that domain.

514
00:34:03,435 --> 00:34:03,655
Scott: Right.

515
00:34:03,695 --> 00:34:06,960
Scott: And you're transferring money from the email address at that domain.

516
00:34:07,641 --> 00:34:07,841
Scott: Right.

517
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:09,163
Scott: You could pull shenanigans.

518
00:34:09,704 --> 00:34:17,496
Scott: So to prevent those shenanigans, we can only let you use Google Pay if you're at Gmail dot com and we control the DNS.

519
00:34:17,837 --> 00:34:19,840
Scott: And I'm like, that at least makes sense.

520
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:31,940
Rym: Granted, it causes another problem of, OK, so now anyone using Google Pay and transferring money has to trust that that's the right specific Gmail account of a person because Gmail says that's always been a problem.

521
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,103
Scott: That's a problem with all these payments anyway.

522
00:34:34,443 --> 00:34:38,329
Scott: So as a result, we were happily using Google Pay.

523
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:46,159
Scott: And now we can't use Google Pay anymore at all unless I use it with my non make another Gmail account.

524
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,103
Scott: That's like a regular consumer one.

525
00:34:48,143 --> 00:34:48,344
Scott: Yeah.

526
00:34:48,384 --> 00:34:51,949
Rym: But then I have to have my phone logged into both of those accounts.

527
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:52,571
Scott: Which is right.

528
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:53,172
Scott: It doesn't work.

529
00:34:53,212 --> 00:34:54,174
Scott: It's a pain in the ass.

530
00:34:54,313 --> 00:34:55,155
Scott: So it's a non start.

531
00:34:55,175 --> 00:34:55,877
Scott: I have to use a different.

532
00:34:55,897 --> 00:34:57,199
Scott: Basically, they kicked me off Google Pay.

533
00:34:57,219 --> 00:34:57,900
Scott: I use something else now.

534
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:06,895
Rym: So then in September, September 7th, they did something where suddenly everyone, not just us, who had a Google Workspaces account could not access.

535
00:35:06,995 --> 00:35:09,940
Scott: It seemed to be mostly the people who had the grandfathered ones.

536
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:16,929
Rym: So in my employer, we used Google Workspaces because we had Google Drive and stuff.

537
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:20,734
Rym: And I couldn't go to Google News at work either.

538
00:35:20,794 --> 00:35:21,715
Scott: It didn't happen to my.

539
00:35:21,755 --> 00:35:23,077
Scott: in my employee is also.

540
00:35:23,137 --> 00:35:25,360
Scott: we use that for but and I was able to.

541
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:25,760
Scott: Yeah.

542
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:30,023
Rym: And it seems like it slowly was affecting everyone, depending on when various caches.

543
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:37,690
Scott: So basically, Google News, right, was if you had one of these accounts and you logged it and you tried to read Google News, it gave you this error.

544
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:51,080
Scott: that said, hey, you know, you can't use Google News and go log into the admin feature, because basically, if you log into the admin of this thing, you can choose which Google apps you want to let the employees at your company use.

545
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:55,665
Scott: You can be like, hey, the employees at my company, they can use Gmail, G-docs and Google Sheets.

546
00:35:55,765 --> 00:35:56,326
Scott: And that's it.

547
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:57,888
Scott: You could you could do that if you wanted to.

548
00:35:58,348 --> 00:36:01,592
Scott: You could also be like, you know what, if my employees want to use YouTube, go nuts, right?

549
00:36:01,672 --> 00:36:02,573
Scott: Use everything you want.

550
00:36:03,073 --> 00:36:07,258
Scott: But Google News was not one of the choices in that list.

551
00:36:07,278 --> 00:36:08,700
Scott: You can't turn it on or off.

552
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,801
Scott: So they turned it off.

553
00:36:12,322 --> 00:36:14,223
Scott: And so a bunch of people started complaining.

554
00:36:14,623 --> 00:36:24,430
Scott: And as a result, you know, one, there was the Google is like these Google groups, like forums, like community forums where you go for support because you can't get real support.

555
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:33,056
Scott: And somebody who is, I guess, like, you know, mod there or something was like, hey, you know, what they said wasn't false.

556
00:36:33,756 --> 00:36:38,320
Scott: It was that, hey, Google News is not one of the apps that's part of the program.

557
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:38,820
Scott: Right.

558
00:36:39,381 --> 00:36:46,640
Scott: So the fact that it's not working is like, you know, hey, you know, use a regular Google account, deal with it.

559
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,004
Rym: So that was a big fuck you to the users.

560
00:36:49,145 --> 00:36:56,620
Rym: And to their credit, before I even could write anything nasty in there, a lot of other people did tons of people writing nasty stuff.

561
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,562
Scott: So I was under the years.

562
00:36:57,602 --> 00:36:59,908
Scott: I learned, first of all, the person.

563
00:36:59,929 --> 00:37:04,300
Scott: I think the person's problem was that they just weren't reading people's messages and responding accordingly.

564
00:37:04,862 --> 00:37:05,062
Scott: Right.

565
00:37:05,103 --> 00:37:08,534
Scott: They were doing a bad job where the Google Pay support person did a great job.

566
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:08,754
Scott: Right.

567
00:37:09,798 --> 00:37:10,420
Scott: But forget about that.

568
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:16,040
Rym: Knowing what I know about the inside of Google, I'm not confident that real Google employees would have done any better, just to be honest.

569
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:16,921
Scott: Who knows.

570
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:25,935
Scott: But forgetting that bad support person, I learned that a lot more people have these grandfathered free accounts than I thought.

571
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:28,740
Scott: I thought hardly anyone had it, but apparently a lot of people have it.

572
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:46,860
Scott: Two, somebody suggested that the reason that these grandfathered accounts just haven't been blown away and we're still safe is because they suspect that several high profile Silicon Valley individuals have these accounts, which makes perfect sense.

573
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,524
Rym: Yeah, because Google doesn't give a shit about us.

574
00:37:48,564 --> 00:37:53,740
Rym: They could just turn this off and literally fuck us into the earth and there'd be nothing we could do about it.

575
00:37:54,361 --> 00:37:55,984
Scott: Yep.

576
00:37:56,144 --> 00:38:02,154
Scott: But it makes perfect sense that like, yeah, big time Silicon Valley people probably signed up for that shit in the mid 2000s when I did.

577
00:38:02,594 --> 00:38:02,775
Scott: Right.

578
00:38:02,795 --> 00:38:05,820
Scott: And they have a lot of clout and would not let go.

579
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,249
Scott: And so Google would take a lot of heat from them if it were to shut it down.

580
00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:12,835
Scott: And that is a plausible reason.

581
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:13,737
Scott: I have no evidence.

582
00:38:13,777 --> 00:38:14,699
Scott: Just someone suggested it.

583
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:25,860
Rym: But the thing is, if Google did shut this down, what I'm not confident they would do, because they're terrible at this, is they'd have to give people like us a path to turn one of these accounts into a regular Google account.

584
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:32,080
Rym: But there is no even remotely plausible path to migrate away from one of these things.

585
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,729
Scott: Nope, not at all.

586
00:38:34,073 --> 00:38:34,600
Scott: I have backups.

587
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,140
Rym: The entire GeekNights YouTube channel.

588
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:41,257
Scott: For you to turn those backups into something would be such a tremendous effort based on the format that they are in.

589
00:38:41,297 --> 00:38:42,260
Scott: But I do have backups.

590
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:48,414
Rym: The GeekNights YouTube channel, my personal YouTube channel, which is also the GeekNights YouTube channel, Scott's YouTube channel.

591
00:38:48,995 --> 00:38:51,060
Rym: This is not stuff you can just move somewhere.

592
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:52,201
Scott: Nope.

593
00:38:53,003 --> 00:38:56,250
Scott: At least not with any feature that Google exposes to the public.

594
00:38:56,631 --> 00:39:00,980
Scott: And they don't give any support, so they don't expose it by phone or anything either.

595
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,103
Rym: And it's endemic of just.

596
00:39:02,163 --> 00:39:07,400
Rym: the real fundamental problem with Google is that it has too many things going on, too many product managers.

597
00:39:08,301 --> 00:39:09,780
Scott: They do keep shutting stuff down.

598
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:19,020
Rym: Well, because its internal structure is set up to like the people who have an incentive to build something new are the ones who seem to do better within the company if they launch something.

599
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:24,540
Rym: But keeping something running or making something that already exists better is extremely deprioritized.

600
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,966
Rym: And it seems like it's mostly multiple.

601
00:39:26,986 --> 00:39:29,012
Rym: people will fight over who gets to launch a feature.

602
00:39:29,674 --> 00:39:31,619
Rym: And that seems to be how most decisions get made.

603
00:39:32,581 --> 00:39:37,435
Scott: Regardless, it ended up just being some kind of bug because Google News was fixed within a day or so.

604
00:39:37,455 --> 00:39:39,280
Scott: It was back online.

605
00:39:41,201 --> 00:39:49,900
Scott: So the person in support clearly had no actual contact inside of Google because they would have found out that it was just a bug that was getting fixed and would have been able to tell us that.

606
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,967
Scott: But it was just as quietly as it broke.

607
00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:54,351
Scott: It was quietly repaired.

608
00:39:54,371 --> 00:39:55,654
Scott: We all can read Google News again.

609
00:39:55,674 --> 00:39:57,780
Scott: So Google Pay is the only thing we've lost.

610
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,759
Rym: But I still don't trust Google at all.

611
00:40:00,683 --> 00:40:00,823
Scott: Right.

612
00:40:00,884 --> 00:40:01,626
Scott: I still don't trust them.

613
00:40:01,746 --> 00:40:02,850
Scott: And I have no choice.

614
00:40:03,372 --> 00:40:04,837
Scott: And I still have said this before.

615
00:40:04,937 --> 00:40:05,700
Scott: And I'll say it again.

616
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:28,580
Scott: If you have a website with accounts that public people can sign up for, there needs to be a law in place such that you have some sort of real human with real administrative powers who can be reached and communicated with by the account holders.

617
00:40:29,142 --> 00:40:29,342
Scott: Right.

618
00:40:29,563 --> 00:40:34,800
Scott: Now, what that person might do when you contact them, right, is who knows what their policies are.

619
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:45,520
Rym: I could hire someone for minimum wage to literally just say nope to anything anyone asks and just have an infinite backlog of unanswered emails and unanswered phone calls.

620
00:40:46,222 --> 00:40:49,320
Scott: Well, there should be some limits on response time.

621
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:49,943
Rym: Oh, yeah.

622
00:40:49,964 --> 00:40:52,160
Rym: I hire an army of people at minimum wage to say nope.

623
00:40:52,581 --> 00:40:52,781
Scott: Right.

624
00:40:53,242 --> 00:41:01,719
Scott: But there also needs to be, you know, if the if the accounts are essential to someone's, you know, livelihood, you know, business, et cetera.

625
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:02,340
Scott: Right.

626
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:08,119
Scott: There at least needs to be mandated by law escape hatch of some sort.

627
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:16,060
Scott: Well, especially with email, because email went from when we have email, but we have email backups.

628
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:16,761
Scott: I backed up.

629
00:41:16,801 --> 00:41:26,100
Rym: I don't know, but I'm saying email, but especially a Google email has become the de facto de facto single sign on for a huge number of people globally.

630
00:41:26,482 --> 00:41:28,797
Rym: See, also Facebook single sign on.

631
00:41:29,601 --> 00:41:30,202
Scott: Yeah.

632
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:37,600
Rym: But they become your identity online in a way that is not able to be I'm not even going to say easy to disentangle.

633
00:41:37,901 --> 00:41:40,318
Rym: You just cannot disentangle that kind of thing at this point.

634
00:41:41,283 --> 00:41:44,700
Rym: Like my Strava account is just fucked if I have a problem with this account.

635
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:55,380
Rym: And because spam is such a problem, it's not like we could just make our own email service and redirect our domain we own to that because no one would accept emails from us.

636
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,320
Scott: Well, I mean, so many people these days just aren't even using email.

637
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,162
Scott: Oh, yeah.

638
00:41:59,664 --> 00:42:04,299
Rym: I mean, a lot of people who don't have an email address that they use or that I could email them at.

639
00:42:04,781 --> 00:42:08,960
Rym: It's there's probably a Monday episode somewhere in that conversation.

640
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:14,580
Rym: But anyway, anyway, things of the day.

641
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,243
Rym: So check this out.

642
00:42:15,303 --> 00:42:19,660
Rym: Now, full disclosure, I did not run the executable that comes out of this at the end.

643
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:24,720
Rym: So I am trusting that it is not malware because it seems really cool and people have talked about it.

644
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,860
Rym: But I'm just saying I did not personally go through these steps.

645
00:42:28,321 --> 00:42:35,518
Rym: But this Twitter account tweeted four images of the old Doom shareware.

646
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,185
Rym: Just Doom shareware.

647
00:42:38,233 --> 00:42:38,918
Rym: They just tweeted it.

648
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,020
Rym: And then they informed everyone that that was actually Doom.

649
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,580
Rym: That you have a copy of the shareware, which they can legally redistribute.

650
00:42:47,061 --> 00:42:58,760
Rym: And then they go on to explain that they use Staganography to encode all of the information necessary to recreate the entirety of the Doom shareware in those four images in the original tweet.

651
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:05,880
Rym: And then they show you using command line on Linux step by step how to just turn those images into this software.

652
00:43:07,401 --> 00:43:09,939
Rym: It's just an amazing, fun little thing.

653
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:20,960
Rym: It's also funny how the code, the entirety of Doom shareware is less than the size of one image I might upload to Twitter via my phone.

654
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:25,220
Scott: You can fit the whole Doom shareware into four JPEG screenshots.

655
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,185
Rym: Not even four JPEG screenshots.

656
00:43:27,687 --> 00:43:32,520
Rym: The lower four bits of the pixels of those screenshots.

657
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,515
Scott: Right, so less than the whole screen.

658
00:43:34,596 --> 00:43:34,820
Scott: Anyway.

659
00:43:35,141 --> 00:43:36,340
Scott: Anyway, so what do you got?

660
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:41,020
Scott: So the Internet Archive, you know, is a place that has all kinds of good stuff.

661
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:49,238
Scott: But I feel like, you know, well, people who know about the Internet Archive and believe in it and support it rarely use it.

662
00:43:50,022 --> 00:43:51,559
Scott: Partly because searching is kind of slow.

663
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,760
Rym: Yeah, like unless I'm researching something specific.

664
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:00,560
Scott: Yeah, but there are really treasure troves of amazing stuff on there.

665
00:44:01,082 --> 00:44:06,139
Scott: But the problem is, is you have to, like, think to know that, like, I could go and get that there.

666
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:06,500
Scott: I could.

667
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:07,360
Scott: And that would be amazing.

668
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:13,760
Scott: So I stumbled today upon one of the collections in the Internet Archive.

669
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:19,700
Scott: Much like it's almost like walking around a library and going into a door and finding out that they have a collection of, you know, whatever.

670
00:44:19,902 --> 00:44:20,999
Scott: Right, that you didn't know was there.

671
00:44:22,001 --> 00:44:28,900
Scott: So there is a collection of exactly what induced us to make today's episode about computing magazines.

672
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:36,300
Scott: This specific old computing magazine called Computist, AKA Hardcore Computist.

673
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,669
Scott: It's had a few different names, but this is an old magazine from the 80s.

674
00:44:42,563 --> 00:44:45,620
Scott: And most it's mostly an Apple to related magazine.

675
00:44:46,481 --> 00:44:53,618
Scott: But most of the content of the magazine is talking about your dad's around.

676
00:44:54,481 --> 00:44:54,985
Rym: I know.

677
00:44:55,146 --> 00:44:56,819
Rym: I know what Computist was all about.

678
00:44:57,465 --> 00:44:59,280
Scott: Yeah, talking about ways.

679
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,826
Rym: You want me to read one of the entries?

680
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:04,600
Rym: Like, I just pulled up a random article from a random one from 1984.

681
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,580
Rym: Hardick issue 12.

682
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:13,500
Scott: To take copy protected softwares and remove the copy protecting part.

683
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:17,218
Rym: So this article is called "Backup for Sabotage" by Clay Harrell.

684
00:45:18,521 --> 00:45:19,340
Rym: Let's list some requirements.

685
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,116
Rym: Sabotage was a game that I played on my Apple.

686
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:22,700
Rym: blah, blah, blah.

687
00:45:23,162 --> 00:45:26,480
Rym: The last time I tried to play it, I noticed the original disc because I have overtime loading.

688
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,263
Rym: Blah, blah, blah.

689
00:45:27,484 --> 00:45:30,079
Rym: Here's the crack to make it work if you don't want to pay for it.

690
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:31,321
Scott: Exactly.

691
00:45:31,903 --> 00:45:36,194
Scott: So it's like, there was an issue that was like, it has like Ultima 4 and Castle Wolfenstein.

692
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,986
Scott: And it's like, yeah, here's what you do.

693
00:45:40,368 --> 00:45:42,960
Scott: Take the floppy disk, copy it to another floppy disk.

694
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,799
Scott: Go to the copy, do this.

695
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,459
Rym: Like open this executable file, change these bytes.

696
00:45:48,922 --> 00:45:54,240
Scott: Type in these commands, do this with this software tool that you have, that we assume you have because you're doing this a lot.

697
00:45:55,203 --> 00:45:56,639
Scott: Do these things and there you go.

698
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:06,160
Scott: You now have a version of Ultima 4 that you can copy all you want and play all you want without having to deal with any, you know, anti-piracy stuff.

699
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,900
Scott: It's just, you know, completely unlocked.

700
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:14,660
Rym: I will never not remind people that when I was getting into computing in the early days, I did not know that piracy was a thing.

701
00:46:14,921 --> 00:46:15,750
Rym: And I just was like, oh, software.

702
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,358
Scott: I didn't understand it either.

703
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,935
Scott: A copy of software.

704
00:46:19,117 --> 00:46:19,319
Scott: Cool.

705
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:23,979
Scott: I saw those messages and I didn't really understand what they were talking about.

706
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:29,920
Rym: The first game I ever installed on my computer, Scorsher, the second game, Scorsher was the first game.

707
00:46:31,683 --> 00:46:37,580
Scott: The first I had Wolfenstein 3D on a three and a half inch floppy that just somebody had scrawled Wolfenstein 3D on the label.

708
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,078
Rym: No, someone at school handed me a disk and on it was Stunts 4D Racing.

709
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:47,080
Rym: And when I launched it, a splash screen appeared that said "Cracked by Killifits" and then the game just worked.

710
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:55,400
Rym: Years later, I discovered that that was not in the actual game and that was in fact the hack that was used so it could be redistributed.

711
00:46:56,521 --> 00:46:59,699
Scott: Yeah, so, you know, this magazine is, you know, has other things in it too.

712
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,700
Scott: But it's really, really interesting stuff.

713
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,365
Scott: Really cool.

714
00:47:03,385 --> 00:47:04,839
Scott: A lot of fun to look through this.

715
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:13,399
Scott: But also there's other old computer magazines out there, you know, and the best ones are the ones that have, like, you know, basically just code that you can read.

716
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,877
Scott: So look for those on here as well and have yourself a good old time.

717
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:22,160
Scott: You can make that like your only nerdery, just like reading old computer magazines.

718
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,420
Scott: There are so many of them, oh my god.

719
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,740
Rym: Alright, so in the meta moment, the Geekless Book Club book, which we are both reading still to finish now.

720
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,598
Scott: I'm making progresses.

721
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:36,640
Rym: The Tale of Genji, not just a novel, but the first novel.

722
00:47:37,283 --> 00:47:40,760
Scott: The first novel written by human beings that we know about ever.

723
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:41,721
Rym: Yep.

724
00:47:41,761 --> 00:47:51,000
Rym: What's interesting is as I get further along, I'm hitting a point where my opinion of the book and the things I have to say are not changing further.

725
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,198
Scott: Like it's falling into some- I'm getting better at reading it.

726
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:54,962
Scott: That is true.

727
00:47:54,982 --> 00:48:00,520
Rym: I'm getting more used to, like, who's who or at least not getting hung up on, like, wait, where the fuck are we now?

728
00:48:01,502 --> 00:48:01,567
Scott: Yep.

729
00:48:02,861 --> 00:48:07,840
Rym: Otherwise, we're still not going to cons until they don't need to require masks anymore.

730
00:48:08,525 --> 00:48:09,618
Rym: So stay tuned for what we do.

731
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:14,260
Rym: I'm working on a couple of panels that maybe I'll just make or will make and just do online.

732
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,700
Rym: There'll be some online cons that have online content.

733
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,880
Rym: Our last PAX panel is just on YouTube, Atari Game Design.

734
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,780
Rym: You can just watch it in all of its glory from PAX East Online 2021.

735
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:26,620
Rym: I think the Game Devs of Color Expo is coming up this week.

736
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,300
Rym: There's going to be real good content.

737
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:28,985
Scott: This weekend, yeah.

738
00:48:29,005 --> 00:48:30,600
Scott: It already starts on Thursday, I think.

739
00:48:30,721 --> 00:48:32,536
Rym: Yeah, real good content at GDOC.

740
00:48:34,043 --> 00:48:35,799
Rym: Like, better talks than I typically see.

741
00:48:35,981 --> 00:48:36,679
Scott: I got my ticket.

742
00:48:37,041 --> 00:48:38,239
Rym: At PAX's and such.

743
00:48:39,201 --> 00:48:40,478
Rym: And let's just get right into it.

744
00:48:41,444 --> 00:48:43,139
Rym: So, computer magazines.

745
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:57,080
Scott: Yeah, so back in the day, even, you know, if you had a computer, even when there was internet, you know, in the 90s, early 2000s even, you know, the internet was- people weren't just publishing all their content on the internet.

746
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,480
Rym: No, there was not a lot of content on the internet.

747
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:01,080
Rym: You couldn't buy things on the internet.

748
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:08,240
Rym: And a lot of times, most of the websites you go to until a way later year than you think were just made by some random person.

749
00:49:09,121 --> 00:49:14,260
Scott: Yeah, it's not like today where every single article in the paper New York Times is also at NYTimes.com, right?

750
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:17,520
Scott: The New York Times is like, you know, we don't want to do that.

751
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,280
Scott: That's obviously a bad idea, right?

752
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:27,960
Scott: So, and they were trying to preserve their existing, which they're still doing even today, but they were trying way harder then to preserve their existing media.

753
00:49:28,081 --> 00:49:37,440
Rym: Like before there was, you know- Fark didn't even appear until like the year 2000, so it's not like you could look stuff up online very much either.

754
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:49,720
Scott: Yeah, so magazines were still a huge deal in terms of getting content, especially, you know, journalism that was of a specialized nature, right?

755
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:54,480
Scott: Because, you know, the journalism that you had access to was the newspaper, which was for a mass audience.

756
00:49:54,981 --> 00:50:02,460
Scott: And you wouldn't find things in the newspaper that would give you detailed information about something specific in a niche, right?

757
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:05,814
Scott: You would go to the bookstore because how many magazines did they have?

758
00:50:05,935 --> 00:50:07,080
Scott: if you're in a suburb, right?

759
00:50:07,761 --> 00:50:14,420
Scott: You know, the only magazines you can get regularly at a newsstand would be like, you know, Time, you know, Life, Sports Illustrated.

760
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:21,820
Rym: At least we spent a lot of time in mall bookstores and like places where there was the magazine rack and there was always a big computer section.

761
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:27,740
Scott: Right, mall bookstore and library were the places that had all the magazines, right?

762
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:33,276
Scott: The regular newsstand only had the, you know, the kind that you see in the barbershop, right?

763
00:50:33,316 --> 00:50:34,700
Scott: Or the doctor's waiting room.

764
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:45,720
Rym: There was nowhere to learn about computers unless you were going to school, knew somebody who was actively teaching you, or primarily reading either these magazines or the underground zines.

765
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,780
Scott: Yup, or you had internet and were on BVS's.

766
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:56,840
Rym: Yup, but even then those BVS's, that was more of a crapshoot of good information compared to the curated collection.

767
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:06,660
Rym: Like the big deal with computer magazines, especially in the 80s through the like mid 2000s, was that each one curated a different type of content.

768
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:12,759
Rym: Like Scott just alluded to with this thing of the day, that magazine had mostly how to crack stuff content.

769
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:20,520
Rym: But like PC Gamer versus Maximum PC versus PC World, they all had very different types of content.

770
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:29,440
Rym: So depending on what area of computing you were interested in, they were almost like the digest way to learn about the current state of the art of that area.

771
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:32,689
Rym: It's weird to talk about the pre-internet world.

772
00:51:33,051 --> 00:51:35,180
Rym: It's so radically different from how I live today.

773
00:51:36,101 --> 00:51:36,262
Scott: Yup.

774
00:51:37,124 --> 00:51:42,300
Scott: So let's talk about, I'm just going to go through some of the magazines that I personally had experience with.

775
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:50,420
Scott: So the one I had a lot of experience with that I was subscribed to for about a year, but also bought off the stand a few times, was Computer Shopper.

776
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:51,720
Scott: And Computer Shopper was a weird name.

777
00:51:51,761 --> 00:51:53,200
Rym: Oh, I forgot about Computer Shopper!

778
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:59,960
Scott: So Computer Shopper stood out, in the 90s especially, because it was fucking enormous.

779
00:52:00,161 --> 00:52:05,880
Scott: We're talking like it's as thick and sort of on the same paper as like a Shonen Jump, right?

780
00:52:06,341 --> 00:52:11,620
Scott: That cheap, cheap paper, but it was really thin, like even thinner than Shonen Jump paper.

781
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,760
Scott: It was in color actually, quite a bit of it, not all of it.

782
00:52:15,441 --> 00:52:17,900
Scott: And it was mega thick and it was big.

783
00:52:18,521 --> 00:52:20,432
Scott: And it was in its own special thing.

784
00:52:20,472 --> 00:52:21,760
Scott: It couldn't go on the regular stand.

785
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:25,580
Scott: It would be like in its own metal bin full of Computer Shopper.

786
00:52:25,802 --> 00:52:26,507
Scott: And it was cheap.

787
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:28,020
Scott: It was like a couple bucks.

788
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,508
Scott: And you bought it.

789
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:32,360
Scott: And of course, why was it so cheap?

790
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:35,052
Scott: Because it was hundreds of pages, mostly ads.

791
00:52:35,354 --> 00:52:36,400
Scott: Almost all ads.

792
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,422
Scott: 99% ads.

793
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:39,804
Rym: It was an era.

794
00:52:40,226 --> 00:52:42,720
Rym: It's fascinating because you'll see this if you look at old newspapers.

795
00:52:44,042 --> 00:52:51,319
Rym: Like old, old timey advertising was often just a list of features and benefits of a product and then a way to buy it.

796
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:52,738
Rym: Like that was it.

797
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:58,720
Rym: So a lot of the ads that I remember from Computer Shopper were, while they were ads, it was a different time.

798
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:00,424
Rym: And they were directly informative.

799
00:53:00,484 --> 00:53:06,259
Rym: Like I learned a lot about RAM and shit from reading Computer Shopper and like the ads in it.

800
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:12,680
Scott: So mixed in with the ads in the front part of the Computer Shopper would be your typical like review type stuff.

801
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,393
Scott: Like, oh, this new video card, let's talk about it, right?

802
00:53:15,433 --> 00:53:16,680
Scott: Hardware, that kind of stuff.

803
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,260
Scott: You know, the same stuff you might see on tomshardware.com.

804
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:22,980
Rym: Granted, for a lot of the time I was reading Computer Shopper, there weren't video cards, really.

805
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,644
Scott: That's true enough, right?

806
00:53:25,266 --> 00:53:41,960
Scott: But then in the back, for some reason, I guess I don't know what its history was, but they were like preserving the history of the magazine in this tiny black and white section in the back where they had like these weird, quirky Alice and Bob articles that would be more at home in something like The Computist, right?

807
00:53:42,362 --> 00:53:43,779
Scott: Or a Dragon Magazine kind of deal.

808
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,499
Rym: I forgot all about Alice and Bob.

809
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:45,881
Rym: Right.

810
00:53:46,383 --> 00:53:46,624
Scott: Yeah.

811
00:53:46,825 --> 00:53:50,380
Scott: So they had this quirky little area in the back that they just kept preserving.

812
00:53:51,441 --> 00:53:52,425
Scott: I stopped reading it.

813
00:53:52,525 --> 00:53:55,396
Scott: It became a smaller magazine and a thinner one at some point.

814
00:53:55,436 --> 00:53:56,420
Scott: And then I'm pretty sure it died.

815
00:53:56,561 --> 00:53:57,227
Rym: I didn't read it.

816
00:53:57,549 --> 00:53:58,639
Rym: Like I would read it like...

817
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:00,975
Scott: I never read one that wasn't a big fat one.

818
00:54:00,995 --> 00:54:01,035
Scott: So...

819
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:01,790
Rym: Yeah.

820
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:12,040
Scott: And I never got... And basically the thing is that magazine, despite being mostly ads, taught me, right, indirectly how to build a computer.

821
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:18,580
Scott: I built my first computer by looking at Computer Shopper and using just common sense.

822
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:22,900
Scott: Like I see a picture of RAM and I see... I finally can see a picture of a motherboard.

823
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:26,260
Scott: That's probably the first time I ever saw a PC motherboard, right?

824
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,839
Scott: And I saw... Well, no, I guess I opened up the IBM and saw it in there, but...

825
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:30,958
Rym: Yeah, for me.

826
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:36,740
Scott: I saw the picture... I saw a picture of a motherboard and I saw what RAM looked like and I saw all the different things they were selling.

827
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,165
Scott: They were selling power supplies.

828
00:54:38,205 --> 00:54:42,920
Scott: They were selling, you know, like hard drives and I saw the things, pictures of them.

829
00:54:43,601 --> 00:54:48,220
Scott: And I could... I was able to figure out from that, like, this is what I need to make a computer.

830
00:54:48,561 --> 00:54:48,822
Rym: Yeah.

831
00:54:48,962 --> 00:54:53,360
Rym: I even would look at... There was an ad for a computer and it listed all the components of the computers.

832
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,940
Rym: Now I knew what things I had to buy to make my own computer.

833
00:54:56,381 --> 00:54:59,931
Scott: And one of the companies that had an ad in there was TC Computer.

834
00:54:59,951 --> 00:55:03,340
Scott: I don't think they exist anymore, which stood for Treasure Chest Computer.

835
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:11,500
Scott: And I went to their website and with the combined with the magazine and their website and the ads, I bought the parts for my first computer.

836
00:55:12,081 --> 00:55:16,580
Scott: They actually sent me the 8-bit motherboard with the Pentium 3 already in it.

837
00:55:16,721 --> 00:55:18,859
Scott: So I didn't have to do that part, but I had to do everything else.

838
00:55:19,481 --> 00:55:21,088
Scott: And I got all these parts.

839
00:55:21,209 --> 00:55:23,760
Scott: I got the right parts successfully.

840
00:55:24,341 --> 00:55:30,420
Scott: And then I figured out how to put them together by common sense and looking at what fit in what hole and what cables they sent me.

841
00:55:30,781 --> 00:55:34,339
Scott: And I successfully built a computer by looking at ads in a magazine.

842
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,499
Rym: I feel like by that... Because I didn't build a computer until the year 2000, right before I went to RIT.

843
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,618
Rym: I think I mostly used...

844
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:42,700
Scott: This was in 1998 or 1999.

845
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:46,980
Rym: I think by then I used, like, the old Tom's Hardware and egghead.com.

846
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,047
Scott: Yeah, I used... This was 1999, yeah.

847
00:55:50,689 --> 00:55:53,540
Scott: So I was a computer shopper, so that was a thing.

848
00:55:53,560 --> 00:56:01,219
Rym: But the one that really got me was not Computer Shopper because it was... The 90s, like the late 90s, is when I really got deep into PCs.

849
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:06,100
Rym: Before that, I was mostly interested in the software because I couldn't afford or build or mess with the hardware.

850
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,060
Rym: So I lived in the software world.

851
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:11,116
Rym: But in the 90s, late 90s, I wanted to build computers.

852
00:56:11,136 --> 00:56:11,920
Rym: I was getting into gaming.

853
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,098
Rym: Like, the hardware mattered more to me.

854
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:23,100
Rym: So Maximum PC was the one I read because it was the flashy magazine that had the articles talking about the fancy, newest nonsense that I definitely could not afford.

855
00:56:23,921 --> 00:56:30,180
Scott: If Maximum PC still existed, they would be the ones with, like, the cases with the cooling systems and the lights and that kind of stuff.

856
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:30,751
Rym: Absolutely.

857
00:56:30,772 --> 00:56:30,999
Rym: Absolutely.

858
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:33,118
Scott: That was the atmosphere of Maximum PC.

859
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:40,520
Rym: But it had, like, this... Every issue had this overview of, like, what's the latest in the world of computing?

860
00:56:40,721 --> 00:56:44,100
Rym: And that's how I stayed on top of things way more than the internet in that era.

861
00:56:45,762 --> 00:56:49,760
Rym: And it also would have a lot of articles talking about how hardware worked, which Computer Shopper never had.

862
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:54,995
Rym: And that... Maximum PC... To be clear, I never subscribed to that magazine.

863
00:56:55,396 --> 00:56:56,820
Rym: I would read it in the bookstore.

864
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,799
Rym: Most of these I read in bookstores.

865
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:07,780
Rym: The only one I got delivered and subscribed to was PC Gamer, which really we should talk about more on a Wednesday or a Tuesday episode.

866
00:57:08,261 --> 00:57:10,791
Scott: PC Gamer was mostly video game magazine.

867
00:57:11,112 --> 00:57:13,060
Scott: It was the same as a GamePro or anything else.

868
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:18,040
Scott: It just only talked about PC games and included a CD because it was talking about PC games.

869
00:57:18,141 --> 00:57:19,718
Rym: PC Gamer came with a disc.

870
00:57:22,084 --> 00:57:23,218
Rym: Eventually it came with a CD.

871
00:57:24,401 --> 00:57:29,780
Scott: But it came with demos of games, sometimes full games, because you can do that when it's PC games.

872
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,180
Scott: You couldn't really provide an NES cartridge with a Nintendo Power magazine.

873
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:34,639
Rym: But I guess my point there is that...

874
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,772
Scott: It also talked about hardware in there as well.

875
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:38,040
Scott: So it was, like, a double deal.

876
00:57:38,761 --> 00:57:42,080
Scott: They had game reviews and they had hardware stuff.

877
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,669
Rym: Except I barely read PC Gamer.

878
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:45,299
Rym: I just wanted that disc.

879
00:57:46,143 --> 00:57:50,220
Scott: I bought a few PC gamers off the shelf at the bookstore to get the disc.

880
00:57:51,422 --> 00:57:53,177
Scott: I never subscribed to it.

881
00:57:53,378 --> 00:57:53,580
Scott: Anyway.

882
00:57:55,002 --> 00:57:59,860
Scott: So you had your zines that were sort of... I guess the biggest zine was 2600.

883
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,640
Scott: It was still somewhat alive.

884
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,320
Rym: It's actually the only one I read.

885
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:10,160
Rym: I would get the text of issues of 2600 from a local BBS that I would dial into.

886
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:16,000
Scott: 2600 was big enough that actually they would have issues at the bookstore, on the shelf, with the other magazines.

887
00:58:16,162 --> 00:58:17,840
Scott: Like at the Barnes and Noble or whatever.

888
00:58:18,404 --> 00:58:18,940
Scott: Or the Borders.

889
00:58:19,862 --> 00:58:22,520
Scott: I actually have a book that was published at some point.

890
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,750
Scott: It's like best of 2600 collection.

891
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:26,820
Scott: Like this huge fat book that's on my shelf over there.

892
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:32,319
Scott: But 2600 started out as the phone freaking zine.

893
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,489
Rym: Yeah, which we were on the tail.

894
00:58:34,529 --> 00:58:36,500
Rym: We were pretty young when that was dying out.

895
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,578
Scott: We were too young for that, yeah.

896
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:41,440
Scott: So it was coming out of that scene.

897
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:47,020
Scott: So it has an origin that was really sort of hardcore and ultra nerdy and whatnot.

898
00:58:47,781 --> 00:58:52,320
Scott: But as time went on, the content didn't really get away from that.

899
00:58:52,540 --> 00:59:00,480
Scott: The content was still articles about deep technical specific stuff in different areas.

900
00:59:02,043 --> 00:59:04,660
Scott: But it was less underground.

901
00:59:04,981 --> 00:59:06,006
Scott: People knew about it.

902
00:59:06,106 --> 00:59:08,436
Scott: You could buy it literally at Borders books.

903
00:59:08,476 --> 00:59:09,360
Scott: There it fucking is.

904
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,400
Scott: It was being published properly.

905
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:16,440
Rym: It had much less of a counterculture street cred by that point.

906
00:59:17,241 --> 00:59:20,660
Scott: Right, and it wasn't doing so much the illegal type contents.

907
00:59:21,361 --> 00:59:23,300
Scott: Here's how to make free phone calls type stuff.

908
00:59:23,781 --> 00:59:29,140
Scott: Even though it was still deep technical topics of various computing and phone nature.

909
00:59:30,502 --> 00:59:35,620
Scott: So 2600 really, I think, I'm not sure how or to what extent it still exists.

910
00:59:36,302 --> 00:59:40,040
Scott: But it does have a historical importance to it.

911
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:45,980
Scott: And is kind of representative, especially the earlier issues of what all those other zines were kind of like.

912
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:53,800
Rym: Yeah, it's interesting because that was an era when I would read old 2600s but not more recent ones.

913
00:59:54,161 --> 01:00:01,439
Rym: And I was mostly interested in the stories and the technology of freaking and all the old stuff that I mostly missed out on.

914
01:00:02,664 --> 01:00:04,240
Scott: You didn't get to do it, but you learned about it.

915
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,045
Rym: I got to do it a little bit.

916
01:00:05,105 --> 01:00:07,680
Rym: I did get a red box to work when I was in middle school.

917
01:00:09,163 --> 01:00:10,673
Rym: But that's just the one that plays the tones.

918
01:00:10,713 --> 01:00:11,639
Rym: that makes a payphone work.

919
01:00:12,061 --> 01:00:13,217
Rym: That was a really easy thing to do.

920
01:00:15,401 --> 01:00:16,820
Scott: It would work on an old payphone.

921
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:22,500
Rym: Yeah, it totally worked on old payphones up until our early days in middle school in some parts of the US.

922
01:00:23,347 --> 01:00:24,720
Rym: That definitely doesn't work anymore.

923
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:29,640
Scott: There was another set of magazines that I'd never bought or read at all, but I knew about them.

924
01:00:30,181 --> 01:00:32,120
Rym: Like PC Magazine, all that stuff?

925
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,464
Scott: Right, PC Magazine.

926
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:35,311
Scott: I think the ZD had one.

927
01:00:36,254 --> 01:00:37,740
Scott: CNET might have had one also.

928
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:42,680
Scott: And basically those magazines read the way those websites read.

929
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:50,859
Scott: These sort of popular articles about what's going on in the world of personal computing and stuff.

930
01:00:51,684 --> 01:00:55,401
Rym: Oh, CNET shut down their magazine in 2019.

931
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:57,048
Scott: Okay.

932
01:00:57,148 --> 01:01:00,020
Scott: You go to CNET.com and look at the articles.

933
01:01:00,681 --> 01:01:04,880
Scott: Or go to ZDNET, if that still exists, and read the articles or any of those places.

934
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:09,340
Scott: That's what those magazines were like, only full of ads, obviously, and on paper.

935
01:01:10,861 --> 01:01:13,840
Scott: And so I'd only read them if I was in a dentist's office.

936
01:01:14,021 --> 01:01:20,120
Scott: And they mostly appealed to these people who were not ultra nerdy, like you're going to program a computer.

937
01:01:20,562 --> 01:01:23,296
Scott: But you're an uncle who's got money.

938
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:25,679
Rym: It was everyone's uncle who read these things.

939
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,570
Scott: Yeah, you're into computers.

940
01:01:27,611 --> 01:01:28,820
Scott: You care about computers.

941
01:01:29,321 --> 01:01:33,360
Scott: You got your computer as a little hobby, but you're not programming.

942
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:38,780
Scott: You're not going lower than simply going to CompUSA to have some fun.

943
01:01:39,422 --> 01:01:44,339
Rym: I would say that those magazines, all the CNET adjacent magazines, there were so many of them.

944
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,060
Rym: They were the things that might be in a dentist's office and you read out of boredom.

945
01:01:48,522 --> 01:01:51,859
Rym: Or the people who liked them seemed to read them more for entertainment than knowledge.

946
01:01:52,902 --> 01:01:53,448
Rym: Which is fair.

947
01:01:53,528 --> 01:01:54,719
Rym: I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that.

948
01:01:55,542 --> 01:02:04,020
Rym: I read Popular Science for entertainment, not to learn anything in particular, because it didn't teach much past a certain point in its history.

949
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:06,860
Scott: I always remembered at the barber shop there was always a golf magazine.

950
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:11,320
Scott: And I didn't golf, but I would read the golf magazine there and it'd be fun.

951
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:14,360
Scott: But it's like professional golfers were not reading the golf magazine.

952
01:02:17,101 --> 01:02:21,759
Rym: It's the same way at the dentist I would read Reader's Digest because that's what was there.

953
01:02:22,801 --> 01:02:23,157
Scott: Exactly.

954
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:24,619
Rym: I didn't have a Game Boy yet.

955
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,070
Scott: So there was a whole bunch of those.

956
01:02:26,211 --> 01:02:27,139
Scott: I think they're all dead now.

957
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:29,568
Scott: There was one called Dr.

958
01:02:29,608 --> 01:02:30,331
Scott: Dobbs Journal.

959
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:32,259
Scott: I don't know if this still exists or not.

960
01:02:32,841 --> 01:02:37,320
Scott: But it was sort of borderline scientific journal magazine.

961
01:02:39,341 --> 01:02:48,720
Scott: And the only time I read it is because it would be lying around just for free when I was in college in the computer science area.

962
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:51,700
Scott: They would just have these lying around on tables and I would read it occasionally.

963
01:02:52,341 --> 01:02:56,920
Scott: And it had journal article type stuff in it among ads and other things.

964
01:02:57,381 --> 01:03:00,300
Scott: Mostly to do with actual programming and computer science.

965
01:03:00,641 --> 01:03:08,540
Scott: Oh, here's a cryptography journal article formatted in late LaTeX and everything.

966
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:16,159
Scott: I'm not sure if it actually was a real journal where you tried to get your research published or not.

967
01:03:16,963 --> 01:03:19,059
Scott: But it sure read like one only with ads in it.

968
01:03:19,561 --> 01:03:21,169
Scott: So that was a thing.

969
01:03:21,189 --> 01:03:23,098
Scott: I don't know if it's still around now.

970
01:03:24,722 --> 01:03:28,240
Rym: It's interesting because I see like that whole class of content itself.

971
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:40,200
Rym: Like, I don't know, there's a lot of websites like Gizmodo and Engadget and things that basically their articles are the same kind of content that would be in a lot of the PC magazine articles back in the day just on a website.

972
01:03:40,941 --> 01:03:53,480
Rym: But at the same time, the world is so different now that the format of read a magazine that is a curated selection of those articles every month doesn't really fit anymore.

973
01:03:53,680 --> 01:04:01,060
Rym: Like I read the individual articles and individual sites based on specific interests, which is just a radically different paradigm from the pre-internet world.

974
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:07,580
Scott: So last magazine category I can think of is this one that I got for free.

975
01:04:07,741 --> 01:04:09,640
Scott: I don't remember how the fuck I got it for free.

976
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,897
Scott: I had like a one or two year subscription for zero dollars somehow in the late 90s.

977
01:04:14,062 --> 01:04:16,820
Scott: And it was called Silicon Alley Reporter.

978
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,199
Scott: It doesn't exist now for sure.

979
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,099
Rym: I never encountered that one, I don't think.

980
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:21,200
Scott: Yeah.

981
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:27,660
Scott: So it was basically this came out of the 90s, like investment boom kind of deal.

982
01:04:27,881 --> 01:04:28,202
Scott: Right.

983
01:04:28,242 --> 01:04:31,960
Scott: You know, with tech stocks booming up and startups and all that biz.

984
01:04:33,641 --> 01:04:45,400
Scott: And all the articles in it were a lot like the articles you'd read today on like, you know, a hacker news or a tech dirt kind of place, which is talking about startups and business more than it's talking about technology.

985
01:04:46,381 --> 01:04:55,820
Scott: And it had a mix of that sort of like, you know, Silicon Valley disgusting culture, but it was the Silicon Alley reporter.

986
01:04:56,301 --> 01:05:02,860
Scott: And it was basically trying to sort of promote New York as like, hey, in New York, we have a Silicon Alley.

987
01:05:03,041 --> 01:05:05,679
Scott: It's the same kind of thing as Silicon Valley, only in New York.

988
01:05:06,622 --> 01:05:06,843
Scott: Right.

989
01:05:06,863 --> 01:05:10,019
Scott: Kind of trying to drum up that same disgusting culture here.

990
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:16,100
Rym: You know, I usually say the other thing, Silicon Valley pays people in dreams and in New York, they got to pay you cash.

991
01:05:16,382 --> 01:05:18,700
Rym: That's why nobody likes to talk about Silicon Alley.

992
01:05:19,581 --> 01:05:27,880
Scott: But the Silicon Alley reporter also, right, mixed in sort of like, you know, a lot of like futurist type thinking articles.

993
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,440
Scott: There would always be like one or two in there along with all the other stuff.

994
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,872
Scott: So it's like I was getting it for free.

995
01:05:33,892 --> 01:05:34,559
Scott: I don't know how.

996
01:05:38,084 --> 01:05:40,900
Scott: And you obviously didn't see it at RIT because it had stopped showing up.

997
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:53,120
Rym: I guess what I miss from this entire space, because we've gone on for well over an hour already, but I miss the computer magazines that would have an interesting project or how to every month.

998
01:05:53,481 --> 01:05:55,879
Scott: Like those make magazine went under.

999
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,718
Scott: Make magazine was a thing you could make.

1000
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,160
Scott: I never got make magazine because it was expensive.

1001
01:06:01,943 --> 01:06:04,020
Scott: If it was cheaper, I would have gotten it.

1002
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:09,220
Scott: But I really liked all the things that like that make organization was doing, especially the Maker Faire.

1003
01:06:09,784 --> 01:06:11,920
Scott: They just went under even pre-pandemic.

1004
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:18,020
Rym: I guess what I miss, and I don't think this is just me like having nostalgia and remembering incorrectly.

1005
01:06:18,901 --> 01:06:25,920
Rym: But in those old the PC magazines that had how tos and projects and like guides like, hey, here's how to build a thing or do a cool thing.

1006
01:06:26,963 --> 01:06:29,320
Rym: They did a lot more explanation of the how and why.

1007
01:06:29,842 --> 01:06:34,160
Rym: And the instructions were usually airtight and really well put together with context.

1008
01:06:35,501 --> 01:06:39,800
Rym: Online today, that type of content seems to have split into two directions.

1009
01:06:40,301 --> 01:06:44,520
Rym: It's either here's a bunch of stuff to copy paste into config files with no explanation.

1010
01:06:44,641 --> 01:06:47,159
Rym: That won't work even two months after it comes out.

1011
01:06:47,944 --> 01:06:49,279
Rym: Or it's a video.

1012
01:06:50,601 --> 01:06:53,620
Rym: The least information dense way to present that information.

1013
01:06:54,680 --> 01:07:00,620
Scott: Well, it's also a consequence of just if you have some old computer and you need the computers to help you do something.

1014
01:07:01,383 --> 01:07:05,740
Scott: It's like that computer you're working so much closer to the metal.

1015
01:07:06,381 --> 01:07:07,900
Rym: You really needed that foundation.

1016
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,500
Scott: At least in terms of abstraction layers.

1017
01:07:11,781 --> 01:07:16,259
Scott: It's like you really need someone to tell you like, type this, now type this, now press this key.

1018
01:07:17,281 --> 01:07:22,420
Scott: You don't need that on a current computer because you can describe something to something at the higher abstraction layer.

1019
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:25,140
Scott: You can be like install that and then do that.

1020
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:28,460
Scott: It's like you don't have to be like, OK, put the disk in the computer.

1021
01:07:28,561 --> 01:07:30,280
Scott: Now type install, now press enter.

1022
01:07:30,461 --> 01:07:31,076
Scott: You don't have to do that.

1023
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:39,317
Scott: I do highly recommend going in archive.org and if not the computist, just look for any old computer magazines, 80s, 90s.

1024
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:44,260
Scott: And it's like that content of that type just doesn't exist anymore.

1025
01:07:45,001 --> 01:07:54,480
Scott: And if you really want to have a lot of fun, get some magazines that go with a particular old computer like an Apple II or like an Amiga.

1026
01:07:54,621 --> 01:07:57,795
Rym: Like Amiga magazines had their Amiga specific nonsense.

1027
01:07:57,835 --> 01:07:58,880
Rym: that was always real fun.

1028
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:05,480
Scott: And then get yourself an emulator for that old computer and do the stuff in the magazines.

1029
01:08:05,763 --> 01:08:07,599
Scott: You can actually have a really fun time that way.

1030
01:08:08,882 --> 01:08:09,778
Scott: I might in fact do that.

1031
01:08:11,664 --> 01:08:12,528
Rym: I could finally play.

1032
01:08:12,568 --> 01:08:14,739
Rym: I've never messed with an Amiga in my life actually.

1033
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:15,863
Scott: Me either.

1034
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:17,314
Scott: I've seen one.

1035
01:08:17,515 --> 01:08:17,796
Scott: That's it.

1036
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:26,200
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1037
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:31,420
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1038
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:36,720
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1039
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,660
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1040
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:44,420
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1041
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,916
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1042
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:52,180
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1043
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:55,359
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1044
01:08:56,104 --> 01:09:26,899
Rym: And the Patreon Patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Heidi McNicholallen, Joyce Link, Eiji Dread, Lily Tenebrae, Chris Reimer, Clinton Walton, Dex Finn, JustLikeADudeGuy, Kshaya Yaw, 85, Rebecca Dunn, ReviewMadBull34, Cowards, Ryan Parent, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Horrell, Taylor Braun, UndergramProLaw, Ed O'Peirce, RightSeed, AbThreat, Open, YouHoldTheKeyToMyHeart, and a bunch of people who do not want me to say their names.

1045
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:32,300
Rym: As you've noticed, we are continuing our regularly scheduled cadence of episodes.

1046
01:09:33,241 --> 01:09:41,220
Rym: And you're going to see our content start to increase again as we slowly emerge from the quarantine, start to get outside, start to do things in our lives.

1047
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,917
Rym: We've got a few projects in the hopper.

1048
01:09:43,962 --> 01:09:46,859
Rym: So we'll see what comes of that potential occasional GeekNights Friday.

1049
01:09:46,981 --> 01:09:48,960
Rym: We'll see what comes of some other things.

1050
01:09:49,322 --> 01:09:56,700
Rym: We're not restarting the Utena show, because as I've said a couple times, we keep getting legal trouble too often for those videos.

1051
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:59,480
Rym: It's just not worth it to make anime content on YouTube.

1052
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:03,539
Rym: Like, I'm sorry, that sucks, but it's just not worth the risk to us.

1053
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:08,480
Rym: And if you have a problem with that, you can write to your senator and try to get the DMC overturned.

1054
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:11,851
Rym: But for now, I leave you with...

1055
01:10:14,943 --> 01:10:16,212
Media: I don't want to be an emperor.

1056
01:10:16,635 --> 01:10:17,300
Media: That's not my business.

1057
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,506
Media: ...or conquer anyone.

1058
01:10:20,526 --> 01:10:22,700
Media: I should like to help everyone if possible.

1059
01:10:23,281 --> 01:10:25,460
Media: Jew, Gentile, black man, white.

1060
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:27,689
Media: We all want to help one another.

1061
01:10:27,971 --> 01:10:29,099
Media: Human beings are like that.

1062
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,080
Media: We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery.

1063
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,680
Media: We don't want to hate and despise one another.

1064
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:39,840
Media: In this world, there's room for everyone, and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone.

1065
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:44,400
Media: The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.

1066
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:52,280
Media: Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.

1067
01:10:53,181 --> 01:10:55,799
Media: We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in.

1068
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,679
Media: Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want.

1069
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:02,640
Media: Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind.

1070
01:11:03,321 --> 01:11:05,399
Media: We think too much and feel too little.

1071
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:08,240
Media: More than machinery, we need humanity.

1072
01:11:08,761 --> 01:11:11,540
Media: More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness.

1073
01:11:12,263 --> 01:11:15,520
Media: Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.

1074
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,680
Media: The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together.

1075
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:24,859
Media: The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all.

1076
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:35,720
Media: Even now, my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.

1077
01:11:36,641 --> 01:11:39,340
Media: To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair.

1078
01:11:39,964 --> 01:11:46,100
Media: The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.

1079
01:11:46,781 --> 01:11:53,120
Media: The hate of men will pass and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people.

1080
01:11:53,521 --> 01:11:56,439
Media: And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.

1081
01:11:58,541 --> 01:12:00,539
Rym: Soldiers, don't give yourselves to brutes.

1082
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:10,600
Rym: Men who despise you, enslave you, who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel, who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder.

1083
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:16,659
Media: Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts.

1084
01:12:17,261 --> 01:12:20,339
Media: You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men.

1085
01:12:21,021 --> 01:12:22,759
Media: You have the love of humanity in your hearts.

1086
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:26,960
Media: You don't hate, only the unloved hate, the unloved and the unnatural.

1087
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:30,420
Rym: Soldiers, don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty.

1088
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:32,073
Media: In the 17th chapter of St.

1089
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:42,780
Media: Luke it is written, the kingdom of God is within man, not one man nor a group of men, but in all men, in you, you the people have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness.

1090
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:48,460
Media: You the people have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.

1091
01:12:48,921 --> 01:13:01,140
Scott: Then in the name of democracy, let us use that power, let us all unite, let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future and old age a security.

1092
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:07,799
Media: By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power, but they lie, they do not fulfill that promise, they never will.

1093
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:11,460
Media: Dictators free themselves, but they enslave the people.

1094
01:13:12,021 --> 01:13:22,100
Media: Now let us fight to fulfill that promise, let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance.

1095
01:13:22,881 --> 01:13:28,820
Rym: Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.

1096
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:33,159
Scott: Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us all unite!
