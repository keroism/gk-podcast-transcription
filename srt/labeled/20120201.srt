00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,189
Rym: It's Wednesday, February 1st, 2012.

2
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:11,329
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,784 --> 00:00:14,340
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,219
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,086
Rym: Way late to the party.

6
00:00:18,146 --> 00:00:24,521
Rym: We finish our review of all 52 of the new 52.

7
00:00:24,521 --> 00:00:25,538
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,310
Rym: You know, going into this thing, I expected it to be a slog, but I was optimistic.

9
00:00:33,311 --> 00:00:36,070
Rym: I'm saddened at how much of a slog it became.

10
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:38,597
Scott: I mean, it just took us so long.

11
00:00:38,637 --> 00:00:39,059
Scott: I mean, what?

12
00:00:39,099 --> 00:00:41,490
Scott: I think it's been half a year almost.

13
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,830
Scott: It's like we did half of it, and then we stopped, and then finally we get around to doing the other half.

14
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:46,990
Scott: And I've pretty much forgotten.

15
00:00:48,532 --> 00:00:52,010
Scott: Maybe we shouldn't talk about this until we actually get to the second part of the show.

16
00:00:52,770 --> 00:01:00,290
Rym: Just so you know, we're late to the party, and the saddest thing is I read most of these way back, like right before we were gonna do the episode originally.

17
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,710
Scott: It's like you skip into the second half of the episode.

18
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,209
Rym: Yeah, but when I read them again now, I kind of forgot.

19
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:05,489
Scott: How many bits we can use right now?

20
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,430
Rym: Oh yeah, so we missed two shows because Scott went out of town, and, well no, you went to meet your parents or something.

21
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:12,609
Scott: My parents came to town.

22
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:16,590
Rym: And I got sick for the first time in like, for fuck ever.

23
00:01:16,871 --> 00:01:18,430
Scott: Alright, so check this out this morning, right?

24
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,679
Scott: See, I have this MetroCard that lasts a whole year.

25
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:23,070
Scott: It's annoying because it sort of wears out.

26
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,924
Rym: Yeah, because I think about what my MetroCard looks like at the end of a month.

27
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:27,049
Rym: I can't imagine a year.

28
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,270
Scott: Well, I have one that lasted a year, and it actually worked right up until the end.

29
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:37,090
Scott: But I was thinking, you know, that today was the 31st, and it would still have one more day, and then I would have to use the new one tomorrow, right?

30
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:44,610
Scott: So I go into the subway, and like New York, you know, I didn't push a guy, but I sort of slightly cut in front of a slow guy to get to the thing, right?

31
00:01:44,852 --> 00:01:45,409
Scott: Ah, ah, ah.

32
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,768
Scott: And I swipe it, and it said expired, and I'm like, "Oh, are you fucking kidding

33
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:48,929
Scott: me?".

34
00:01:49,431 --> 00:01:53,470
Scott: I, you know, cut a guy to fail swipe, you know?

35
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,260
Scott: And I was like, "Why?

36
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:54,625
Scott: Why has it

37
00:01:54,645 --> 00:01:55,030
Scott: expired?".

38
00:01:55,131 --> 00:01:57,504
Scott: I looked at my phone, and I'm pretty sure my phone said 31st, and not first.

39
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:00,529
Scott: Obviously, it said first, because it is the first.

40
00:02:02,032 --> 00:02:06,347
Scott: And then I went to the, you know, the check your MetroCard thing, and it said, "Yeah, that one's expired, and your new one's

41
00:02:06,408 --> 00:02:06,570
Scott: good.".

42
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:08,830
Scott: And of course, I was carrying the new one with me just in case.

43
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,550
Rym: Yeah, I always have three MetroCards.

44
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,350
Rym: Current one, next monthly one, and cash card for, you know, bullshit.

45
00:02:15,893 --> 00:02:16,290
Rym: Air train.

46
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,790
Rym: Yeah, and it invariably happens.

47
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,950
Rym: Or, you know, strangers in town doesn't have a MetroCard.

48
00:02:21,253 --> 00:02:21,390
Scott: Right.

49
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:25,230
Scott: So I go, you know, and I just swipe the other one, and it works.

50
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:27,946
Scott: And then, like, later in the day, I'm still thinking it's 31st.

51
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,665
Scott: And I look, and it says first, and I'm like,

52
00:02:30,766 --> 00:02:31,008
Scott: "Whaaaat?".

53
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,310
Scott: And, like, it was just the weirdest, you know, brain exploding.

54
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,989
Scott: I know that makes not a good story.

55
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:37,810
Rym: I have a similar story.

56
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,890
Rym: So, for PAX, right?

57
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,270
Rym: You know, we submitted our panels and all our stuff, you know, a long time ago.

58
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:48,727
Rym: But the deadline for, like, completing any modifications, like the descriptions and whatever, was February 1st.

59
00:02:49,811 --> 00:02:53,385
Rym: So, on the 30th, I was like, "Oh shit, I gotta make sure everything's good

60
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:53,887
Rym: tonight.".

61
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:55,861
Rym: I forgot there was a 31st day.

62
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:57,968
Scott: That's not a big deal.

63
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,329
Rym: Yeah, but, so we both were off by one.

64
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,710
Rym: See, this is not a terribly great anecdote.

65
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:12,390
Scott: So, since you have to go over, like, twice as many comics as we did in the previous comic episodes concerning the DC-52, we're just not gonna do news to save time, so I can go home.

66
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,949
Rym: Also, what news?

67
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:13,830
Rym: Bandai's dead.

68
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,850
Rym: There's a new Watchmen comic coming out.

69
00:03:16,132 --> 00:03:16,390
Rym: Oh, God.

70
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:27,369
Scott: Kazuhiro Otomo is gonna be at San Diego Comic-Con, which would make me almost want to go, except for the fact that, uh, if you want to go, you'd have to buy tickets immediately, and hotel room, what are you gonna get?

71
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,909
Rym: A hotel, I don't know, but I could get us in.

72
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,270
Rym: I guarantee it.

73
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,090
Scott: It's already too late.

74
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,850
Scott: You have to basically buy tickets the day of the previous Comic-Con.

75
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,030
Rym: I am confident I could get us into the Comic-Con legitimately.

76
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,790
Rym: However, we would not have a hotel, and I don't really want to go that much.

77
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,649
Scott: Me either, but it's just, you know, I said it almost makes you want to go.

78
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,929
Scott: I didn't say I definitely need to go now.

79
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,710
Rym: The thing is, you know, PAX is en route to be in the same situation in terms of sellout.

80
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,050
Scott: That's not my problem.

81
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:00,030
Rym: Selling out of badges, not selling out of, you know, whatever it is you sell out of when you sell out.

82
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:00,770
Scott: That's not my problem.

83
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:01,826
Scott: Okay.

84
00:04:03,495 --> 00:04:13,569
Scott: Uh, but yeah, there's like a zillion newses, and I also have a zillion things of the day that I will now parse out very slow, parcel out, extremely slowly, one at a time, in fact, to make the most of them.

85
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:15,129
Scott: Uh, yeah.

86
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,660
Rym: So, of course, things of the day.

87
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:28,240
Rym: I'm gonna collect, there's a new meme, not a new meme, a new-ish meme that I just didn't know about.

88
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,440
Scott: Shit Astrus says.

89
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,480
Rym: Uh, so I like, uh, shit no one says.

90
00:04:33,963 --> 00:04:35,495
Scott: We need to do shit FRCform says.

91
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:49,140
Rym: I was poking around on the internet, and my YouTube channel, partly because I'm me, and also partly because it's always logged in in the communal computer, which a lot of different people are using, pretty much recommends pony videos for everything.

92
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,499
Rym: You watch any video, and it recommends, like, some pony video.

93
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:51,736
Rym: Yeah.

94
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,240
Rym: So, I see this when I'm something, and then, like, when I'm something else.

95
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:03,600
Rym: It's when I'm, and then, like, either a verb or a noun, like, when I'm Fluttershy, or when I'm assertive.

96
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,700
Rym: I'm like, wow, there's a lot of those.

97
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,456
Rym: I wonder what that is.

98
00:05:06,081 --> 00:05:10,120
Rym: So, I click on it, and my ears are assailed with a techno beat.

99
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:11,598
Rym: Pretty good techno beat.

100
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,260
Scott: It's pretty good.

101
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,760
Rym: And in the, and behind this techno beat is- I don't know.

102
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:17,119
Scott: Is it technically more techno riff?

103
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:17,998
Scott: Yeah, it's a riffer.

104
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,396
Scott: I'm not sure.

105
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:19,616
Rym: Whatever.

106
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:24,820
Rym: You know, we could go into the subgenre of techno, because it's a little more, like, electro than, but anyway.

107
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,280
Scott: Whatever.

108
00:05:25,621 --> 00:05:26,800
Rym: It's a pretty good, like, bit.

109
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,860
Rym: And the videos were all in the exact same format.

110
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:39,720
Rym: Like, they all followed the same pattern, and it seemed to be a template to make a particular kind of character music video set to this song.

111
00:05:39,983 --> 00:05:40,196
Rym: Mm-hmm.

112
00:05:40,622 --> 00:05:42,200
Rym: And they were all really good.

113
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:42,700
Rym: I was like, hey.

114
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,260
Scott: But most of them were ponies or TF2 characters, and one was that girl from Gurren Lagann.

115
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:47,455
Scott: Yep.

116
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:49,620
Rym: So, 90% of them were ponies.

117
00:05:50,923 --> 00:05:56,060
Rym: Like, I'd click on one, and then all the recommendations would be, like, ten more that I hadn't seen.

118
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:57,520
Rym: that were all My Little Pony.

119
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,540
Rym: And then I started digging and digging and digging.

120
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,600
Rym: We found, like, one to Heavy and, like, two other Team Fortress ones.

121
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:07,859
Rym: And as far as I can tell, that one to Gurren Lagann is the first one.

122
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,399
Rym: And from what I can gather- The Rainbow Dash is the second one?

123
00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:12,440
Rym: Yeah, pretty much.

124
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,520
Rym: It was from that to Rainbow Dash.

125
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:23,660
Rym: And then the pony community saw the Rainbow Dash one and made every possible- There are ones for side characters I didn't even recognize.

126
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,180
Rym: There's one for not Tom Dan, but for the other rock.

127
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:29,218
Scott: Oh.

128
00:06:30,105 --> 00:06:31,060
Scott: What's the pile of rocks?

129
00:06:31,681 --> 00:06:32,838
Rym: It's Madame Le Fleur.

130
00:06:33,482 --> 00:06:34,580
Scott: Well, that's the bag of flour.

131
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,379
Rym: Yeah, I don't remember the rocks.

132
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,920
Scott: Oh, it's the name of the pile of rocks.

133
00:06:37,961 --> 00:06:38,640
Scott: I forgot the name.

134
00:06:38,903 --> 00:06:38,997
Rym: Yeah.

135
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,099
Rym: Yeah, we both forgot.

136
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,118
Scott: Madame Le Fleur.

137
00:06:41,643 --> 00:06:42,520
Scott: Sir Lincelot.

138
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:42,865
Rym: Yep.

139
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:44,458
Rym: Who was the rock?

140
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,219
Scott: The Bucket of Beats, which is- You don't remember that one either.

141
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:48,311
Rym: Yeah.

142
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,220
Rym: We're terrible fans.

143
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,300
Rym: So anyway, this is an interesting meme that kind of came about recently.

144
00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:01,220
Rym: So one, I challenge you guys out there to make more entries into this meme that are not My Little Pony.

145
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,179
Scott: Well, you forgot to mention there was one that was sort of epic, which is the one that really stood out, which is- Oh my God.

146
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,900
Scott: King of Hyrule from Phillips CDI Zelda.

147
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:16,660
Scott: And it's like, so there's a whole bunch of pony ones and there's some TF2 ones and whatever, and then the one that stands out is Phillips CDI King of Hyrule.

148
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:22,659
Scott: And it's like, oh my God, someone just went and grabbed the most obscure, perfect, awesome character for this video style.

149
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:29,363
Rym: So my challenge to you is one, make videos of this to things that don't have videos to it.

150
00:07:29,786 --> 00:07:30,120
Scott: Obviously.

151
00:07:30,482 --> 00:07:36,199
Scott: If you want, all of our videos- And find characters that make one that's more awesome than the King of Hyrule one.

152
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,320
Scott: That's going to be rough.

153
00:07:37,962 --> 00:07:38,259
Scott: It's hard.

154
00:07:39,362 --> 00:07:43,679
Rym: I got some ideas, but I got to save them because I might make them because it's a pretty easy formula to make a video for.

155
00:07:44,140 --> 00:08:01,060
Rym: But two, what I'd love for someone to do, and I'd say I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it, is to chart out the time of upload of all these videos so we can confirm where it started, when it hit Pony, and then from Pony, find all the ones that came after that and try to figure out the overlaps of different fan bases.

156
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:05,700
Rym: I think this kind of current meme would be really interesting to research.

157
00:08:06,082 --> 00:08:09,440
Rym: Like, right now, the exact timeline of it being popular.

158
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:19,598
Rym: Speaking of just kind of an aside, speaking of old memes and everything, so one of the developers, a young one at my company, said something like, "I'm really angry for

159
00:08:19,698 --> 00:08:20,140
Rym: something.".

160
00:08:20,482 --> 00:08:20,966
Rym: And I was like,

161
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,095
Rym: "Coins?".

162
00:08:23,143 --> 00:08:25,180
Rym: Of course, nobody knew what the fuck I was talking about.

163
00:08:25,901 --> 00:08:27,537
Rym: So I was like, "All right, I'm going to show you

164
00:08:27,577 --> 00:08:27,900
Rym: something.".

165
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,811
Rym: And I explained the whole deal, and he watched it, and he looked at me, and he said, "What the fuck was

166
00:08:31,852 --> 00:08:32,096
Rym: that?".

167
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,756
Rym: It's Coinbird, and it was the coins.

168
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:40,539
Rym: And I said to him, "You will never, for the rest of your life, hear the words 'angry for' and not immediately think coins.

169
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:48,500
Rym: I have infected you with a permanent, irreparable, irrecoverable, incurable, memory-based meme.

170
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,332
Rym: Virus.".

171
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:49,715
Scott: Great.

172
00:08:50,323 --> 00:08:50,918
Rym: I was proud of that.

173
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,500
Scott: So, this is a website, right?

174
00:08:53,901 --> 00:09:01,778
Scott: And I'm pretty sure this website is going to be hosed at some point, mostly because they're using Ustream, and they're probably going to get their Ustream account banned or something.

175
00:09:02,144 --> 00:09:02,880
Rym: Oh, Ustream.

176
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:05,299
Scott: But, it's running right now.

177
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:15,734
Scott: This is ToonamiAftermath.com, and basically some dudes just set up their own Toonami to replace the lack of Toonami, and it's 24/7 Toonami.

178
00:09:18,522 --> 00:09:24,440
Scott: Right now, if you go to the site, at least at the moment of this recording, it's currently playing Dragon Ball Z Abridged.

179
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,779
Scott: Up next, Dragon Ball Z Abridged.

180
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:27,339
Scott: After that, Dragon Ball Z Abridged.

181
00:09:28,622 --> 00:09:37,940
Scott: If you look at the schedule, it's like Thundercats, Dragon Ball, Gundams, Power Puffs, you know, pretty much all the kind of things out beyond Toonami.

182
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,220
Scott: Old X-Men, The Tick, Transformers.

183
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:41,860
Rym: You know what?

184
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,039
Rym: There's only one thing to say.

185
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,196
Rym: Godspeed to you good sirs.

186
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,960
Scott: Yeah, if you guys can keep this thing going.

187
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,999
Scott: They've even got Lupin and the Midnight Run.

188
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:52,239
Rym: Oh my god, we used to watch that at midnight at RIT.

189
00:09:52,680 --> 00:10:00,520
Scott: Right, it's like, you know, so, and it's, you just watch it on Ustream, illegally, I guess, or some get, I guess Dragon Ball Z Abridged is semi-legal.

190
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,834
Rym: In fact, we watched that, we watched that at midnight on the 1974 color RCA.

191
00:10:07,543 --> 00:10:11,740
Scott: Yeah, but it's in Ustream, so there's a big chat going on pretty much all the time.

192
00:10:12,381 --> 00:10:13,660
Scott: These people are watching Toonami.

193
00:10:14,602 --> 00:10:19,540
Scott: It's also sort of questionable because they got like a little PayPal, like give us money, and I'm like, uh, yeah, dudes.

194
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,820
Rym: Yeah, it's one thing if you're violating copyright blatantly and awesomely for great awesome, but if you're also trying to make money.

195
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:40,260
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, it doesn't matter, you can just go here and, you know, if you need to fill that void in your life that Toonami used to fill, just go to this website while it's still running, ToonamiAftermath.com, and press play and full screen that shit.

196
00:10:41,061 --> 00:10:44,815
Rym: And of course, very briefly in the meta moment, the book club books are the same they've always been.

197
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,199
Rym: We didn't record the show yet because I was sick and Scott was busy.

198
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,960
Scott: Yeah, we were actually going to do the episode on Thursday, we just didn't.

199
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,858
Rym: It'll be done as soon as it will be.

200
00:10:53,545 --> 00:10:54,919
Rym: PAX East is coming up, we'll be there.

201
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,019
Rym: Anime Boston is coming up, we will hopefully be there if we can work it out.

202
00:10:59,001 --> 00:11:03,378
Rym: And beyond that, we uploaded some more panels and stuff from MAGFest, so check out our YouTube channel.

203
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,100
Scott: Check out all our internet places.

204
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,938
Scott: Facebook, Google+, Twitter, etc.

205
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,118
Scott: Fromacrew.com.

206
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:09,683
Rym: So, week three.

207
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,300
Scott: Alright, we gotta burn through this shit.

208
00:11:14,642 --> 00:11:15,398
Rym: I got some notes.

209
00:11:16,463 --> 00:11:22,899
Scott: So, it's been a while since we've done this, it's weird because these are the issue ones, and it's like, they're already on issue four, five, something like that.

210
00:11:23,262 --> 00:11:24,419
Scott: So, is this even relevant?

211
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,078
Scott: It doesn't matter, I spent the money for it, so we're gonna do it.

212
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,619
Rym: It is relevant because I wager the majority of the people listening to this right now have not read any of them.

213
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,280
Scott: Probably.

214
00:11:34,381 --> 00:11:39,559
Scott: Anyway, so, where we left off, the last one we did was Superboy, which was sort of the Astro Boy whatever.

215
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,900
Rym: Oh, speaking of which, remember how Superboy, I liked it, I wanted to see where it was going?

216
00:11:43,462 --> 00:11:46,640
Rym: I read, I think, four and five in the comic book shop.

217
00:11:47,361 --> 00:11:50,640
Rym: Good God, did that turn into superhero, boring bullshit.

218
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,280
Rym: So, it's no longer Astro Boy, but anyway.

219
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,780
Scott: Well, we're moving on, let's just get into it so we don't waste time.

220
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,240
Scott: Regular old Batman, just Batman.

221
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:07,040
Scott: Not any, you know, Batman colon something, not, you know, Detective Comics or Arkham and whatnot, it's just Batman.

222
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:15,943
Scott: And actually, this comic, believe it or not, has 25 pages of comics, which is four more than the average of 21.

223
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,440
Scott: But yeah, what to say about this.

224
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,140
Rym: What I wrote is interesting.

225
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,049
Rym: I wrote, "I'm

226
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:21,797
Rym: Batman!".

227
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,679
Rym: And then I wrote like hell next to it.

228
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,540
Rym: And I wrote that it's surreal, like, pseudo Frank Miller-esque bullshit.

229
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,400
Scott: Yeah, see the thing that bothered, I wrote down.

230
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:41,140
Rym: Like, it looks like the way something might have happened in Dark Knight Returns, but it's so, it's almost like a cliche of that kind of Batman.

231
00:12:41,702 --> 00:12:49,100
Scott: Yeah, the things that I noticed that were sort of weird were, number one, I wrote three Robins hyphen pedo question mark.

232
00:12:50,342 --> 00:12:55,380
Rym: I wrote Grayson, Drake, Damian, and then I wrote Jail Time.

233
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:56,363
Scott: Yeah.

234
00:12:58,202 --> 00:13:00,600
Scott: There's something going on with all these extra Robins.

235
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,130
Scott: It's like...

236
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:01,979
Rym: Oh, you think?

237
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:09,180
Scott: Yeah, he's got three of them with him, but then apparently the first one is apparently up to no good or someone pretending...

238
00:13:09,242 --> 00:13:09,754
Rym: No, he's not.

239
00:13:10,341 --> 00:13:11,120
Scott: Clearly he's not.

240
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,140
Scott: Obviously it's some bullshit.

241
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,660
Rym: But it's just like... I mean, this had that fake out with the Joker, like, "Hey, Batman in the Joker.

242
00:13:17,044 --> 00:13:17,340
Rym: Nope.

243
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:18,692
Scott: Psych.".

244
00:13:19,082 --> 00:13:21,940
Scott: Yeah, it's just sort of annoying how they just like, "Didn't one of the Robins die?

245
00:13:22,081 --> 00:13:22,611
Scott: Why are they all

246
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:22,896
Scott: there?".

247
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:24,060
Rym: Maybe there's a fourth one?

248
00:13:24,163 --> 00:13:24,679
Rym: I don't know.

249
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,220
Scott: It's like this whole shit makes no sense.

250
00:13:27,621 --> 00:13:28,800
Scott: And that's sort of what I don't like.

251
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,300
Scott: It's like, in the olden days, they had a character Robin.

252
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:39,718
Rym: No, no, to be fair, at least this one, it put a little word bubble under each one when it showed all three of them, and it showed their name, and it said, "This was the first Robin.

253
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,599
Rym: This was the second Robin.

254
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,149
Rym: It was not

255
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:41,720
Rym: inaccessible.".

256
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:42,759
Scott: But this is what the thing is.

257
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,800
Scott: In the olden days of comics, they had a character Robin, they died, and then replaced him.

258
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,732
Scott: And nowadays, more recently...

259
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,680
Rym: They turned him into a superhero with his own line.

260
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,955
Scott: Right, around the '80s-ish.

261
00:13:54,100 --> 00:14:01,896
Scott: It's like they take all... They're like, "Oh, well, all these Robins died and came back, so what we can do is we can actually just make a whole bunch of Robins at

262
00:14:02,138 --> 00:14:02,259
Scott: once.".

263
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,820
Scott: It's like, "Well, no, there's one Robin.

264
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:05,777
Scott: You killed the other

265
00:14:05,797 --> 00:14:05,919
Scott: ones.".

266
00:14:06,682 --> 00:14:08,719
Scott: And obviously, this is incredibly old news.

267
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:21,060
Scott: This is not a recent development, but it's just, as a non-superhero reader, someone who new comes into this as number one issue and sees four Robins there, most people in the world don't know there's more than one Robin.

268
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,732
Scott: So when they see four Robins, they're like,

269
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:24,075
Scott: "What?".

270
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:26,596
Scott: It's fucked up.

271
00:14:26,941 --> 00:14:27,936
Rym: My only real complaint...

272
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,379
Scott: And the thing is, most people, they know Bruce Wayne is Batman.

273
00:14:31,202 --> 00:14:34,240
Scott: Most people on the street could not give you the real name of any of the Robins.

274
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:40,297
Rym: Now, note, they did this well, in that it did not bother trying to explain who the Joker was.

275
00:14:40,788 --> 00:14:41,219
Scott: It just assumed.

276
00:14:41,661 --> 00:14:43,039
Scott: I think they can let that one go.

277
00:14:43,402 --> 00:14:44,159
Rym: And Batman and Bruce Wayne.

278
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,658
Rym: That's okay.

279
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,760
Rym: But they did feel the need to explain who the Robins were, so I think you're right on that front.

280
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,719
Rym: I think it handled it well.

281
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:51,680
Rym: My complaint wasn't the Robins.

282
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,680
Rym: My complaint was that the story...

283
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:53,979
Scott: It's just something that stood out to me.

284
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,560
Rym: The story just didn't... I didn't give one shit about the story.

285
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,637
Scott: I didn't give one shit about the story in most of these comics.

286
00:15:01,144 --> 00:15:07,199
Rym: All the other non-Justice League Batman so far that we've read were way better than the actual Batman.

287
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:10,560
Rym: This was the worst of the non-Justice League Batman.

288
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,738
Scott: Yeah, so I gave it a meh.

289
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,359
Rym: Yeah, pretty much a meh.

290
00:15:15,823 --> 00:15:16,288
Rym: I might read, too.

291
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,660
Scott: I think the only reason I gave it a meh is because it wasn't painfully bad, as he knows.

292
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,040
Scott: It was just not good.

293
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,020
Rym: It felt forced.

294
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,318
Rym: It felt like, "This is what Batman is, so we're going to make Batman what Batman

295
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:28,539
Rym: is.".

296
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:31,699
Scott: And it's the one called Batman, so they can't diverge.

297
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,200
Scott: It's just got to be the core of what Batman's about.

298
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,800
Rym: I think All-Star Western was a better Batman than this Batman.

299
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,699
Scott: Well, we'll get to that.

300
00:15:38,401 --> 00:15:45,559
Rym: Yeah, but I would read this if I was pooping and it happened to be in the bathroom with me and I didn't have something else to read.

301
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,939
Scott: That's true for almost every comic book.

302
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,019
Rym: That's true for almost any written words.

303
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:53,018
Scott: Yeah, okay, so Birds of Prey.

304
00:15:53,681 --> 00:15:57,520
Scott: So basically, I kind of sort of was getting into this, right?

305
00:15:57,681 --> 00:16:02,160
Scott: It's about this reporter guy and he's sort of following these girls to see what's up with them.

306
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,740
Rym: But they fucking kill him at the end of the first issue and I didn't care anymore.

307
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,778
Scott: Hello, right?

308
00:16:06,363 --> 00:16:07,580
Scott: That was exactly what I wrote.

309
00:16:07,621 --> 00:16:08,178
Scott: I liked him.

310
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:08,890
Scott: Right.

311
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:14,172
Scott: That's what I wrote in my notes was like, "Wow, it takes balls to kill the main guy in the first

312
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:14,557
Scott: issue.".

313
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,899
Rym: Because he's not the main guy.

314
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,039
Rym: The T and A are the main guy.

315
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,880
Scott: Exactly, but I sort of liked that guy, but they killed him because he wasn't a superhero or something.

316
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,035
Scott: I know.

317
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:38,260
Rym: What I thought this was going to be was the Birds of Prey are these kind of superhero stereotypical comic book badass women and they were going to have cool heists and stories around and this reporter was going to follow them and he was going to be the straight man or the observer.

318
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,359
Rym: It would all be through his eyes.

319
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:51,040
Scott: That's why Marvels, the comic named Marvels, which is about this guy who's just a reporter and it's all seeing the history of the Marvel universe through from that guy's perspective and that's why it's so awesome.

320
00:16:52,603 --> 00:16:56,636
Scott: Here, it was sort of good in that way, but then it was really just.

321
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:59,739
Scott: he was a temporary one issue vehicle for this T and A fest.

322
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,200
Rym: Unless he didn't actually.

323
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:02,100
Rym: The T and A wasn't that bad.

324
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,220
Scott: It wasn't as bad as the other comics that we will discuss soon.

325
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:10,680
Rym: I wouldn't even call this T and A because we're on orders of magnitude.

326
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:11,638
Scott: See, I can't do that.

327
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:12,598
Scott: Here's the thing.

328
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,859
Scott: Relative to the other things, it is not bad at all.

329
00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:19,339
Rym: Relative to Hitler, Pinochet not that bad.

330
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:19,915
Scott: Exactly.

331
00:17:20,101 --> 00:17:21,817
Scott: So this is still Pinochet, right?

332
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:25,020
Rym: You can't, you know, it's still Pinochet.

333
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:27,539
Scott: It's just because there's a Hitler over there.

334
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,179
Scott: It doesn't mean this is not T and A.

335
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:35,938
Rym: The words I wrote are without the awesome guy, this is comic bookie cliche bullshit dot dot dot.

336
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:36,378
Scott: Yep.

337
00:17:37,262 --> 00:17:38,578
Scott: So yeah, that's another meh.

338
00:17:38,821 --> 00:17:39,253
Rym: Yeah, meh.

339
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:57,298
Scott: At least, you know, I wouldn't, the thing is it's like if it was, if all the issues are like this, it might, you know, and here's the thing though, I just realized just because I was reviewing these just before the show to get the fresh in the memory, you look at the end and actually the guy's got blood coming out his eyes and then he's on fire and we're just like, oh, he's dead.

340
00:17:57,582 --> 00:17:58,200
Scott: He might not be dead.

341
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,680
Scott: He might be becoming a superhero right there, which is equally bad to being dead.

342
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,760
Rym: Especially because you got his internal monologue right before this happened.

343
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,179
Scott: But it's called Birds of Prey.

344
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,018
Scott: I'm pretty sure the point of this book is it's about girl heroes and he's a dude, so that's not going to happen.

345
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:16,119
Rym: The thing is, I think Birds of Prey as characters would probably work as a summer blockbuster like superhero movie.

346
00:18:16,522 --> 00:18:19,460
Scott: Well, yeah, I mean, it's semi Batman universe, right?

347
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,740
Rym: And they were throwing out one liners and it was all this kind of actiony stuff.

348
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,299
Rym: And you know what?

349
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,780
Rym: The action seemed like it was a little better choreographed.

350
00:18:27,281 --> 00:18:31,280
Rym: It would feel like some of the Ghost in the Shell kind of like action I like.

351
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,100
Scott: Kick and punching, yeah, maybe.

352
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:37,560
Rym: The kicking and punching was more Ghost in the Shelly than other superheroes, but I didn't care about the plot.

353
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:38,978
Scott: And there's a little bit less of it.

354
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:39,720
Scott: Anyway.

355
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,253
Rym: Yeah.

356
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:40,704
Rym: So.

357
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:41,539
Scott: Okay.

358
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,120
Scott: Blue Beetle.

359
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:42,840
Scott: Blue Beetle.

360
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,220
Scott: Blue Beetle.

361
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,900
Scott: So what do you give it, the Birds of Prey?

362
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,017
Rym: First, I wrote Squark because I think that's the sound that the Scarab made when it teleported away.

363
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:54,919
Scott: Let me look it up.

364
00:18:55,341 --> 00:18:57,339
Rym: I think that's why I wrote that.

365
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,716
Scott: Let me look it up.

366
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,579
Rym: Because that was just kind of like cute and I wasn't sure what to think about it.

367
00:19:04,446 --> 00:19:05,160
Scott: I'm looking at the sound effects.

368
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,319
Rym: When the Green Lantern appears and he's like, "Hey, Blue Beetle

369
00:19:08,379 --> 00:19:08,480
Rym: thing."

370
00:19:08,787 --> 00:19:09,176
Rym: Here it is.

371
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,279
Scott: Lethal threat, Green Lantern, Squark.

372
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:11,839
Scott: Yep.

373
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:12,557
Rym: Told you.

374
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:20,480
Rym: But I wrote Green Lantern BS, Planet 3, Oh God, it's Green Lantern BS.

375
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:20,940
Scott: Right.

376
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:21,539
Scott: So here we go.

377
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,759
Rym: Bunch of superheroes and villains, teen drama, origin story, everything I hate about comic books.

378
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:30,160
Scott: I did like the coloring, right?

379
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:38,920
Scott: It has that bright coloring in it, especially in the high school parts, where everything's bright and high contrast with sort of pony-esque colors.

380
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:43,240
Scott: I really like that when it's not just everything's gray like Batman.

381
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:50,440
Scott: Even when they get to the action, right, it's like Blue Beetle is crazy neon blue and the other things are not blue.

382
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:57,100
Scott: Like this bad guy is crazy yellow and this other bad guy is crazy red and they're in a cyan old school convertible car.

383
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,080
Scott: It's like the colors are just really awesome and I like the arts a lot.

384
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:07,259
Rym: My only real complaints are that one, it started with the origin story, which always annoys me in stuff like this.

385
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:11,459
Rym: It always feels better if it starts in media res with this kind of contiguous whatever universe.

386
00:20:12,442 --> 00:20:15,580
Rym: And two, why the Green Lantern bullshit?

387
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,740
Rym: Why is the Green Lantern bullshit in so many of these comics?

388
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,580
Scott: You could have just had that whole beetle thing without the Green Lantern coming and zapping the beetle, whatever.

389
00:20:24,642 --> 00:20:36,520
Rym: The only interesting thing is that that Green Lantern thing, coupled with the Mayan stuff, like oh, it landed in the Mayan era, kind of sets up all this timeline stuff for the other comics, but that's what I hate about DC Comics.

390
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:41,220
Scott: Well, the other thing that I don't like is just Blue Beetle himself, once he turns into the superhero.

391
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:41,838
Rym: Is boring.

392
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:43,219
Scott: I mean, look at that guy.

393
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,659
Scott: That does not look like a guy.

394
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,620
Scott: He looks like a bad guy.

395
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,399
Rym: He is a bad guy.

396
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:51,236
Rym: Remember, basically Blue Beetle, as far as I can tell, is a rip off of the Silver Surfer story.

397
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,420
Scott: But Silver Surfer is a good guy.

398
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,558
Scott: He's the goodest guy.

399
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,340
Rym: But he was sent as the herald to the place that Galactus is going to fucking eat.

400
00:20:58,801 --> 00:21:01,080
Scott: No, that's not the story of the Silver Surfer at all.

401
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:02,719
Rym: But isn't that what he was supposed to do?

402
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,440
Scott: Well, that was his temporary job.

403
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,299
Rym: Yeah, and you know what, that's the Blue Beetle's temporary job, too.

404
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:15,679
Rym: The Scarab goes to a planet and makes a super killing whatever that prepares the planet for the rest of them to cocoon it and eat it or whatever it is they do.

405
00:21:16,604 --> 00:21:16,857
Scott: Maybe.

406
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,560
Rym: They told you all this in this comic.

407
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,180
Rym: You just don't remember.

408
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:19,938
Scott: Most likely.

409
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:21,780
Rym: It's bullshit.

410
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,358
Rym: I didn't like it.

411
00:21:22,461 --> 00:21:23,020
Rym: This is bad.

412
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:23,701
Scott: Also,

413
00:21:23,721 --> 00:21:25,164
Scott: V.I.V.,

414
00:21:25,204 --> 00:21:38,278
Scott: our discussion last time about the forced racial diversity, this one was forcing the Hispanics, you know, yeah, it really it bothered me how much it went out of its way.

415
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,960
Scott: So and it's like it's like it's weird because it's like we're trying to be diverse.

416
00:21:44,321 --> 00:21:52,039
Scott: So what we're going to do is we're going to put in a sort of toned down, not so caricatured racial stereotype in there.

417
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,620
Rym: But they do it in such a milquetoast way that it almost feels like if I need it.

418
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:02,999
Scott: It's like if I needed my comic to be more, you know, Russian and I put sort of Soda Popinsky in there, but I made him less comical.

419
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,320
Rym: Less Drunkinski?

420
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,679
Scott: Yes, less Drunkinski.

421
00:22:06,363 --> 00:22:07,360
Scott: So what did you give this one?

422
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:07,645
Scott: Bad.

423
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:11,400
Rym: I just have no interest in ever reading another page of Blue Beetle.

424
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,778
Scott: I gave it meh, but it was low meh.

425
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,480
Rym: So Captain Atom.

426
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,459
Scott: So I got to ask you.

427
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:22,740
Rym: So when you looked at Captain Atom, I thought first I picked it up and I said, "What, Watchmen?

428
00:22:23,863 --> 00:22:24,311
Rym: Is this just Dr.

429
00:22:24,332 --> 00:22:24,678
Rym: Manhattan?".

430
00:22:25,002 --> 00:22:26,918
Rym: And I flipped through it like, "Yeah, it is just Dr.

431
00:22:26,938 --> 00:22:27,120
Rym: Manhattan.".

432
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,158
Scott: Well, I looked at it and my first thing was like, "Oh, this is going to be real

433
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:30,440
Scott: bad.".

434
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:31,454
Rym: Oh, I just assumed it was Dr.

435
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:31,799
Rym: Manhattan.

436
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,100
Scott: I assumed it was going to be awful.

437
00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:39,520
Scott: So then I read it and actually, uh, it was surprisingly awesome.

438
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,015
Scott: Really?

439
00:22:40,563 --> 00:22:42,440
Rym: I found it really boring and trite.

440
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:43,260
Scott: You thought it was boring?

441
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,440
Scott: For some reason, his is the weird thing, right?

442
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,380
Scott: It's like my memory tells me that when I first read it, I thought it was awesome.

443
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,878
Scott: Like unexpectedly so.

444
00:22:51,441 --> 00:22:57,700
Scott: But upon rereading it, like the first half of it is mostly that typical talking about nonsense words.

445
00:22:57,924 --> 00:22:58,618
Rym: Quote, quote.

446
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,623
Rym: I wrote Dr.

447
00:22:59,643 --> 00:23:05,219
Rym: Manhattan question mark and then expository explanation of the bullshit made up powers.

448
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:05,980
Scott: Exactly.

449
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,320
Rym: I don't need that.

450
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,380
Scott: For some reason, the first time I read it, right, I thought it was awesome.

451
00:23:11,601 --> 00:23:19,000
Scott: And looking at it now, the only reason I think that I thought it was awesome originally was because the art is like just unbelievably awesome.

452
00:23:19,161 --> 00:23:19,719
Rym: The art's pretty good.

453
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,300
Rym: I'll give it that.

454
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,280
Scott: Like, look at that fucking monster on this page in the back.

455
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:23,973
Rym: Oh yeah.

456
00:23:25,101 --> 00:23:27,179
Scott: With all the mouths coming out of it and shit?

457
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,180
Rym: That's part of my problem with it.

458
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:32,797
Rym: It had too many kind of discontinuous plot threads and the sudden volcano and all this kind of just...

459
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,619
Scott: Plus, I sort of like how Captain Adam himself is drawn sort of all pencil-y, you know?

460
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,459
Scott: It's like, oh man, that's kind of cool.

461
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:39,952
Rym: Yep.

462
00:23:40,725 --> 00:23:41,720
Rym: It had a lot going for it.

463
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:48,840
Rym: The only thing I really didn't like other than the expository bullshit of the made up powers was one, Indian Point doesn't look anything like that.

464
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:49,420
Scott: Well, no.

465
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:49,919
Scott: Oh my God.

466
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,240
Scott: This is like, what was the other one?

467
00:23:51,461 --> 00:23:51,959
Scott: Static Shock.

468
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,379
Scott: Where I was complaining... The Queensborough Bridge.

469
00:23:54,722 --> 00:23:57,499
Scott: It's like these people... I can see the Queensborough Bridge right now.

470
00:23:57,701 --> 00:23:59,120
Scott: R and DC and Marvel Comics in New York.

471
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,980
Scott: I know the artists live all over the place and they use FTP to send in their pages.

472
00:24:03,361 --> 00:24:07,360
Rym: Just take Google Maps and just go somewhere if you're going to say something in London.

473
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,959
Scott: Google Earth and Google Street View will cover you.

474
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,560
Scott: There is no fucking excuse.

475
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,619
Rym: Just zoom in and look at what it looks like and at least approximate it.

476
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:24,458
Rym: But I don't know, there were too many plot threads that I just, I didn't care and it seemed a little too super hero-y.

477
00:24:25,621 --> 00:24:30,040
Rym: When he kept internally monologuing what he was doing with his powers is when I didn't care anymore.

478
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:37,140
Scott: Yeah, that was the part that I noticed on the just now, taking another look at it, that I was like, why did I think this was good?

479
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,417
Rym: Now here's the thing, if I had never read The Watchmen, I might have thought this was a lot better.

480
00:24:41,516 --> 00:24:42,332
Scott: But... I've read Watchmen 20 times.

481
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,842
Scott: When Dr.

482
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:50,760
Rym: Manhattan is doing his internal monologue of his identical powers, it was brilliant.

483
00:24:50,881 --> 00:24:53,137
Scott: Here's the difference between Captain Adam and Dr.

484
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:53,460
Scott: Manhattan.

485
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,221
Scott: Dr.

486
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:58,000
Scott: Manhattan is omniscient and Captain Adam is not.

487
00:24:58,402 --> 00:24:59,100
Rym: Here's another difference.

488
00:24:59,342 --> 00:25:00,160
Rym: One of them has a dick.

489
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,040
Scott: That's right.

490
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,260
Scott: Well, I think Captain Adam does have a dick, he's just hiding it between his legs.

491
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,499
Rym: If they never show it, he doesn't have it.

492
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,299
Rym: I've decided that that is now, if you don't see it, it's not there.

493
00:25:10,622 --> 00:25:12,660
Scott: Yes sir, it's true, this man has no dick.

494
00:25:13,821 --> 00:25:18,399
Rym: I've seen dicks in shows more and more lately and I think we need to end this prejudice against dicks.

495
00:25:18,905 --> 00:25:20,260
Scott: Okay, dickless.

496
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:28,818
Scott: So yeah, the thing is, I'm gonna read it again before I adjust my original first impression of good.

497
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,760
Rym: Alright, well based on what you said, it's definitely low good.

498
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:37,098
Rym: I'm gonna adjust my original from bad to meh, because you make valid points, I kind of forgot about that art.

499
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,278
Scott: So, meh.

500
00:25:38,688 --> 00:25:38,840
Scott: Alright.

501
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:40,239
Scott: Catwoman.

502
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:41,799
Scott: The worst.

503
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:42,979
Scott: Oh god.

504
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,920
Rym: No, not the worst, bad.

505
00:25:45,303 --> 00:25:46,200
Scott: It was real bad.

506
00:25:46,422 --> 00:25:46,980
Rym: It was not the worst.

507
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,836
Rym: So, is it just me or was the sex scene between Catwoman and Batman gross?

508
00:25:53,402 --> 00:25:54,140
Scott: It was so gross.

509
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,080
Scott: In fact, if you look at my notes, it says there's only two things in my notes, I think.

510
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,820
Scott: They are, oh no, three things.

511
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,977
Rym: I wrote weird Batman sex and cheesecake.

512
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:08,280
Scott: Number one, the first thing I wrote was everyone said it was awful before I read it, because it was all people saying how bad it was, right?

513
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,738
Scott: So I went in with sort of a bad expectation from people.

514
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:11,580
Rym: Interesting.

515
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,377
Scott: Number two was cheesecake, just like everyone said, and number three, ew.

516
00:26:16,203 --> 00:26:16,696
Scott: Just ew.

517
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,122
Scott: Ew.

518
00:26:18,241 --> 00:26:21,480
Scott: Normally, when you have sex in a comic, it's kind of hot.

519
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,720
Scott: If you read Lost Girls, it's impossible not to be aroused unless you're a eunuch.

520
00:26:26,603 --> 00:26:27,660
Rym: Or it's tastefully done.

521
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:34,260
Rym: Like in Watchmen, there is a sex scene between some 30-something, a pretty schlubby guy, and you know what?

522
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,440
Rym: It's an interesting and tasteful, heartfelt scene.

523
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,199
Scott: This- Is disgusting.

524
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:42,300
Scott: Now, you can arm solve- It's also because sort of Batman has how many ribs?

525
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:57,340
Rym: It's like- Also because Batman, I don't know, Batman's face while they're having sex, I feel like, I don't know, you could argue that the sex was gross on purpose because that relationship between those two kinds of people would actually be pretty gross and fucked up.

526
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:03,195
Rym: I think the other thing is that- So you could argue that that was an artistic way to present how fucked up that relationship would be.

527
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:03,627
Rym: Yeah.

528
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,620
Scott: But it's like, you don't want to have this shit explicitly depicted, right?

529
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,320
Scott: You want to have it just, you know, you can imply that, that's fine.

530
00:27:10,782 --> 00:27:14,100
Scott: But don't just be drawing, you know, straight up stuff like that.

531
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,540
Rym: It's like- But beyond that, it focused way too much on cat girls' tits and ass.

532
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:26,516
Scott: No, I mean, look at, did you see what this page, earlier in the book, before there's any sexing, and it's just like, "Excuse to draw boobs in a

533
00:27:26,556 --> 00:27:26,878
Scott: bra.".

534
00:27:27,924 --> 00:27:29,860
Scott: It looks like, look how much detail's in that bra.

535
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:34,118
Scott: Dude fucking went to Victoria's Secret to get like, you know, look at the mannequins or whatever.

536
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,460
Rym: Yup, and meanwhile, all the background characters are just like hardly there.

537
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:37,975
Scott: Yup.

538
00:27:39,028 --> 00:27:40,540
Rym: And the story, like, whatever.

539
00:27:41,265 --> 00:27:41,860
Scott: What story?

540
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,071
Rym: Well, they referenced all this stuff.

541
00:27:44,111 --> 00:27:46,920
Rym: that was not explained, you had to already know about Catwoman, or it didn't make sense.

542
00:27:47,843 --> 00:27:48,500
Scott: This was bad.

543
00:27:48,962 --> 00:27:49,499
Scott: Real bad.

544
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:51,080
Rym: I can't say it's the worst, though, in terms of sexism.

545
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,980
Scott: I mean, the Catwoman movie was bad, I didn't even see it, but everyone said it was bad.

546
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,480
Rym: It's not the worst in sexism.

547
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:57,200
Rym: All right.

548
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,240
Rym: 'Cause we haven't talked about what's coming up.

549
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:00,814
Scott: What's coming up.

550
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,160
Scott: So, DC Universe presents Dead Man.

551
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:04,873
Scott: All right.

552
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:09,260
Scott: The comic series is actually, you know, it's not just Dead Man.

553
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:17,855
Scott: I mean, this issue is just Dead Man, but the comic is actually DC Universe Presents, which means it'll change eventually, it might have changed already, from Dead Man to something else.

554
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,145
Rym: So, I want to talk about this one.

555
00:28:19,245 --> 00:28:25,880
Rym: first, because I read Dead Man last because I saw what Dead Man looked like, and I kept running- It looks like Daredevil.

556
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,740
Rym: So, I kept running into Dead Man, like in a bunch of the other comics.

557
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:34,139
Scott: Well, didn't you read, yeah, I know, but didn't you read Dead Man in, what's it called, the Wednesday comics?

558
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,859
Scott: I just remember there was a Dead Man in there.

559
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:36,398
Rym: Oh, yeah.

560
00:28:36,821 --> 00:28:38,959
Rym: So, I ran into Dead Man in all these places, right?

561
00:28:39,402 --> 00:28:41,159
Rym: And even in the New 52, like he was in there.

562
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,520
Scott: He was in a lot of comics, apparently.

563
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,239
Rym: And I didn't care at all about him.

564
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,300
Scott: I've never cared about him.

565
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,098
Rym: So, when I picked this one up, I was like, "Oh my God, now I have to read Dead

566
00:28:48,139 --> 00:28:48,300
Rym: Man?".

567
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,499
Rym: So, I put it at the bottom of the pile.

568
00:28:50,082 --> 00:28:52,000
Rym: I five-read it, actually, yesterday.

569
00:28:52,962 --> 00:28:54,720
Rym: And I actually like the comic a lot.

570
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:55,377
Rym: You really do?

571
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:56,820
Rym: I like the Dead Man comic.

572
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:57,656
Rym: Okay.

573
00:28:57,901 --> 00:28:58,739
Rym: I think it's a neat story.

574
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,399
Rym: It's not super-hero-y at all.

575
00:29:01,081 --> 00:29:03,500
Scott: Well, I mean, Dead Man's not supposed to be super-hero.

576
00:29:03,681 --> 00:29:07,140
Scott: I don't know much about the history of Dead Man, but it seems like he's just- Oh, fuck the history.

577
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,459
Rym: Pretend I read just this.

578
00:29:09,101 --> 00:29:16,880
Rym: It's a pretty good story about mythology and death and this guy's kind of quantum... It's like Hindu mythology mixed with quantum leap.

579
00:29:17,287 --> 00:29:17,440
Rym: Yeah.

580
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,319
Scott: And I kind of dig that.

581
00:29:18,561 --> 00:29:24,619
Scott: I can't figure out, though, what the deal with Dead Man is, because every time I read a comic with Dead Man in it, which is... I don't know why.

582
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,299
Scott: Is he that popular that he's in all these things?

583
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,560
Scott: That's what I couldn't figure out until I read this.

584
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:31,060
Scott: It's like he has a different... I can't tell what his story is.

585
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,660
Scott: I have to read the Wikipedia about him or something to get the real deal.

586
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,240
Scott: You know what, though?

587
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,440
Scott: It's hard to tell.

588
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:39,698
Rym: If his story is what I read in this right here, I want to read the rest of this Dead Man story.

589
00:29:40,261 --> 00:29:46,019
Scott: Yeah, but basically, from what I can tell, it's just anything dealing with death is like, you know, that's Dead Man.

590
00:29:46,462 --> 00:29:50,180
Scott: He deals... You know, he's already dead, but he's still alive somehow.

591
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,560
Rym: Well, because Rama and Saj did.

592
00:29:53,821 --> 00:29:54,056
Scott: But, yeah.

593
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:56,280
Scott: You know, I didn't like it as much as you did.

594
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,179
Scott: I was just sort of mad.

595
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,899
Rym: Well, Scott, did you like quantum leap?

596
00:29:59,384 --> 00:30:00,960
Scott: I never watched that much quantum leap.

597
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,940
Scott: I watched like maybe one or two episodes when it was on after some cartoon.

598
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,819
Rym: I may have seen all of quantum leap.

599
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:06,917
Scott: That's good for you.

600
00:30:07,503 --> 00:30:09,020
Rym: So, I like Dead Man.

601
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:12,740
Scott: I've seen about as much quantum leap as I've seen MacGyver or anything else like that.

602
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:24,560
Rym: I was really surprised that... It was a pleasant surprise, partly because I went into Dead Man with probably the lowest expectations because I kept... Not because I expected I'd hate it, because I expected it to be boring and I wouldn't give a shit.

603
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:30,080
Rym: Because every time I'd ever run into Dead Man in any other media, I didn't care.

604
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:34,220
Rym: And then when I actually got to Dead Man himself, I actually cared about his story.

605
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:40,660
Scott: So Green Lantern Corps... What the fuck is this bullshit?

606
00:30:41,642 --> 00:30:41,940
Scott: What?

607
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,133
Scott: So my notes...

608
00:30:44,304 --> 00:30:45,420
Rym: That's all I wrote in my notes.

609
00:30:45,501 --> 00:30:46,760
Rym: What the fuck is this bullshit?

610
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:47,650
Scott: Yeah.

611
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:53,399
Scott: So the first thing I wrote is "Lone wolf, no cubs" and I don't know why I wrote that.

612
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:55,776
Rym: Uh, doesn't... I don't know.

613
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,157
Scott: Yeah, the second thing I wrote was "I only care about the badass evil

614
00:31:00,197 --> 00:31:00,559
Scott: dude."

615
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,578
Scott: About the red guy?

616
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:01,869
Scott: Yeah.

617
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:02,727
Scott: "Earth stuff is

618
00:31:02,767 --> 00:31:03,192
Scott: moronic.".

619
00:31:04,461 --> 00:31:06,534
Scott: And the third thing I wrote was "Planet Nerd,

620
00:31:06,816 --> 00:31:07,380
Scott: seriously?".

621
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:08,190
Scott: Or is it "Planet

622
00:31:08,311 --> 00:31:08,737
Scott: Nero?"?

623
00:31:09,365 --> 00:31:10,459
Scott: What's the name of the stupid planet?

624
00:31:10,803 --> 00:31:11,336
Rym: Oh, I don't even...

625
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:13,514
Scott: I think it's Nero, but it's like, "Oh, come

626
00:31:13,676 --> 00:31:13,736
Scott: on.".

627
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:14,433
Rym: Really?

628
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,277
Rym: Here's what bothers me.

629
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:21,040
Rym: One, why is the Green Lantern crap all over all these comics?

630
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,939
Scott: Because that's the most popular shit they got going on.

631
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,180
Rym: No, the Green Lantern story.

632
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:32,980
Rym: This cosmology of the Green Lantern Corps and all these different colored rings is actually very similar to Sailor Moon's overall cosmology.

633
00:31:33,241 --> 00:31:34,000
Scott: Well, there's the thing.

634
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:40,540
Scott: Before the '52, before they ended that and started this whole new thing where they wiped the slate almost clean, right?

635
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:46,620
Scott: The Green Lantern stuff was the biggest, most popular stuff that the superhero fans loved the most that the Geoff Johns guy wrote.

636
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,980
Scott: Remember we read that rebirth and it was awful?

637
00:31:48,061 --> 00:31:49,640
Scott: I know, I know, but I don't get it.

638
00:31:49,700 --> 00:32:05,579
Scott: That rebirth comic that we read and hated started this big wave of all this Green Lantern stuff spawns directly from that trade, and this is just carrying that forward because they're not fixing what ain't broke, at least in terms of what they care about, which is selling to nerds.

639
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,620
Rym: Here's why I don't like the Green Lantern.

640
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:24,020
Rym: Because it is both the epic space, gigantic, incomprehensible plot, and the super, I'm just a dude trying to get by on Earth plot, and it tries to let those two overlap, and they don't overlap at all.

641
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:32,220
Scott: Yeah, this is why I actually like a lot of things like, say, Silver Surfer and such, because what you get is just epic space plot only.

642
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,400
Scott: It's like, "There are gods.

643
00:32:34,782 --> 00:32:37,540
Scott: They have godly powers and they have godly battles.

644
00:32:37,981 --> 00:32:38,224
Scott: End of

645
00:32:38,285 --> 00:32:38,711
Scott: story.".

646
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:39,620
Scott: Right?

647
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:40,160
Scott: That's it.

648
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,339
Scott: God versus God.

649
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,500
Scott: No man.

650
00:32:42,801 --> 00:32:45,120
Scott: And then, if they're giving you a man story, right?

651
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,240
Scott: It's Spider-Man.

652
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,036
Scott: It's just a dude.

653
00:32:47,562 --> 00:32:50,680
Scott: And you don't see Spider-Man fighting the gods, at least not for serious.

654
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:56,199
Scott: He always sort of hides in the corner while the big boys take care of it, and he's like, "Why the fuck am I here?

655
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,600
Scott: Just because I'm the most famous character.

656
00:32:58,942 --> 00:33:00,160
Scott: I have to be in the comic.

657
00:33:00,281 --> 00:33:02,459
Scott: I'm just gonna hide in the corner with my webs.

658
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:04,479
Scott: My webs, they're gonna stop the gods.

659
00:33:06,689 --> 00:33:06,815
Rym: Squirt.".

660
00:33:09,042 --> 00:33:09,839
Rym: I don't know.

661
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:18,840
Rym: The Green Lantern stuff is just so, like it doesn't even make sense that a lot of the other things that happen, like if they overlap all these universes, fine.

662
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:24,138
Rym: But then, half the other problems that happen don't make sense because the Green Lantern car would have just stepped in and fixed it.

663
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,676
Rym: And also, this comic makes zero sense if you don't know what the deal is with all these other rings.

664
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,320
Scott: Yeah, this is, well, I mean, none of this stuff.

665
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,560
Scott: So yeah, I put it as bad.

666
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:35,899
Rym: I put it as the worst.

667
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,658
Scott: The worst.

668
00:33:37,924 --> 00:33:38,800
Scott: I'll change yours to worst.

669
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,879
Rym: Not in terms of sexism.

670
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,240
Rym: Again, we're getting to that.

671
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:41,900
Scott: Okay.

672
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,220
Rym: It's coming.

673
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,740
Scott: So, Legion of Superheroes.

674
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,240
Scott: We did Legion Lost last time.

675
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,799
Scott: This was the same fucking thing!

676
00:33:47,181 --> 00:33:48,000
Scott: Well, hold on, hold on.

677
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,000
Scott: This was a little better than Legion Lost, right?

678
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,472
Scott: It had all the same problems as Legion Lost, like plot.

679
00:33:52,492 --> 00:33:57,340
Scott: that doesn't make sense, a million characters that, you know, they just like, look at this double-page spread.

680
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:06,940
Scott: They drew all these characters in this scene, like so that, 'cause there's fans of these obscure characters, and they put little tags on some of them, you know, like Dream Girl, Element Lad, Cosmic Boy.

681
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,280
Scott: Cosmic Boy, really?

682
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,119
Scott: That's like something a five-year-old would make up.

683
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:10,980
Scott: Like X-Cop.

684
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:16,418
Rym: Well, LA Poet noted some of their powers, like the one guy his power is, he can induce mass to way more.

685
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:17,520
Scott: Yeah, great.

686
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,179
Scott: Comic Queen, really.

687
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:24,712
Scott: Okay, so they drew all these characters in this double-page spread, so fanboys could be like, "Oh, there's the character I like,".

688
00:34:24,732 --> 00:34:25,739
Scott: but they're not even saying anything.

689
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:35,400
Scott: Like, they're just there to appear, and that's like, I noticed that same thing when I read the extremely famous DC comic, Crisis of Infinite Earths, you know, the original Crisis.

690
00:34:35,726 --> 00:34:35,917
Scott: Oh, yeah.

691
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:48,679
Scott: And it's like, they would just have pages and pages where they would just show all these universes, and they just draw all these characters, hundreds of them, and none of them would really do anything, you know, pertinent to the plot, except for the big ones, like Superman and Flash and whatever.

692
00:34:49,679 --> 00:35:00,400
Scott: And it was just, they put them in there just so they could put them all in there to, you know, I guess, because if you're a fan, and you're just seeing the picture of the character gives you some feeling or idea, but it doesn't do anything for a normal person.

693
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:05,039
Rym: The only thing that made this better, I think, than the other Legion laws- Are you gonna say the same thing as me?

694
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:05,795
Scott: Let's find out.

695
00:35:06,101 --> 00:35:10,919
Rym: Was that the two characters we followed the most, the two who actually- Ah, you're saying the same thing as me.

696
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,719
Rym: Actually seemed to have some personality and talked to each other and did stuff like real people.

697
00:35:15,084 --> 00:35:15,180
Scott: Yeah.

698
00:35:16,084 --> 00:35:16,800
Rym: And the art was better.

699
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,460
Scott: Right, so the Brainiac guy, and who was the other one?

700
00:35:20,581 --> 00:35:21,539
Rym: I don't know, but I really like her.

701
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,739
Scott: No, not the girl, the other, the dude.

702
00:35:25,283 --> 00:35:27,380
Rym: I don't, don't ask me names of these people.

703
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,059
Scott: Okay, Mon-El, so he's a Superman kind of guy.

704
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:31,439
Scott: He's from the Superman planet.

705
00:35:31,601 --> 00:35:32,117
Rym: Oh, yeah, that guy.

706
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,159
Scott: And Brainiac, whatever, the green guy.

707
00:35:35,144 --> 00:35:40,635
Scott: They actually had character, and they were kind of awesome, and I kind of wish they would just make a buddy book with those two guys, right?

708
00:35:41,521 --> 00:35:44,359
Scott: Just like the really smart guy and the really strong guy.

709
00:35:45,221 --> 00:35:57,057
Scott: It's a stereotypical cliche deal, but you throw in the superhero powers, and you sort of surround them with, bring in one of these crazy characters per issue.

710
00:35:57,077 --> 00:36:01,419
Scott: that can sort of mix it up and put a different spin on them, because they have all these people to mix up with.

711
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:12,099
Scott: So it's like, issue number one could be smart guy, strong guy, and comet boy, and issue number two could be smart guy, strong guy, and harmonia, or I'm just looking at characters in this book, or Starboy.

712
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,980
Scott: Wow, Starboy looks so gay, oh my god.

713
00:36:15,281 --> 00:36:18,620
Scott: I don't want to say gay to be homophobic, but really, look at this dude.

714
00:36:19,921 --> 00:36:24,280
Scott: I mean gay as in he looks like he is a homosexual, not, you know, like, yeah.

715
00:36:24,402 --> 00:36:25,720
Rym: Not that there's anything wrong with that.

716
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,999
Scott: Yeah, exactly, like straight up.

717
00:36:27,442 --> 00:36:30,900
Scott: You know, it's like they did that on purpose.

718
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:31,934
Scott: I don't know.

719
00:36:32,443 --> 00:36:33,159
Rym: I don't know if they did.

720
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:33,960
Scott: But anyway.

721
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,480
Rym: But it doesn't matter, because the plot is still largely incomprehensible.

722
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,860
Scott: Yeah, despite liking those two characters, it's still bad.

723
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,640
Scott: Okay, Nightwing, so this is the missing Robin, right?

724
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,860
Scott: As far as I can tell, this guy was the first Robin.

725
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,577
Rym: I like this guy.

726
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:49,820
Scott: Really?

727
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:59,838
Rym: I don't like the comic, but I kind of like him as a guy, because it's kind of similar to Batman stories, but he's a little more, it's like Batman if you didn't have crippling emotional problems.

728
00:37:01,205 --> 00:37:02,040
Scott: I guess that's what it is.

729
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:02,880
Rym: I enjoy that.

730
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,615
Rym: I enjoy watching a Batman who isn't just like, "I'm brooding

731
00:37:06,675 --> 00:37:07,298
Rym: Batman.".

732
00:37:08,141 --> 00:37:20,620
Scott: What I actually like the most about this comic is that it, you know, of course it had fighting and whatever, but in terms of pages of fighting, a lot less, you know, than the other comics.

733
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,720
Scott: Some of the comics you had here are just pages and pages of fighting.

734
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:29,380
Scott: Here you had a whole bunch of pages of circus and talking to people at the circus and stuff like that.

735
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:34,400
Scott: It was actually, and it wasn't just talking, you know, to explain what the bad guys are.

736
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,020
Rym: Yeah, the dialogue was reasonable dialogue.

737
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,160
Rym: I wrote reasonable dialogue on my notes.

738
00:37:38,782 --> 00:37:42,359
Scott: Yeah, and you know, it was like, "Hey, something is sort of happening

739
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:42,539
Scott: here.".

740
00:37:42,781 --> 00:37:44,840
Scott: The only note I wrote was emo Robin.

741
00:37:47,345 --> 00:37:47,835
Rym: So meh.

742
00:37:48,181 --> 00:37:49,398
Scott: Yeah, it's definitely meh.

743
00:37:49,662 --> 00:37:50,879
Rym: It doesn't stand out as bad.

744
00:37:51,165 --> 00:37:51,208
Scott: No.

745
00:37:52,421 --> 00:37:53,179
Rym: So Supergirl.

746
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,739
Scott: No, Red Hood and the Outlaws is next.

747
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,171
Rym: Oh, right.

748
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,178
Rym: The worst.

749
00:37:57,882 --> 00:37:58,260
Scott: The worst?

750
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,360
Rym: So the worst, in terms of sexism, Red Hood and the Outlaws, you win.

751
00:38:02,761 --> 00:38:03,980
Scott: You think this is the most sexist?

752
00:38:04,121 --> 00:38:05,060
Scott: I think, "Oh, you're right.

753
00:38:05,161 --> 00:38:05,679
Scott: This is the one.

754
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,320
Rym: I'm sorry.

755
00:38:07,206 --> 00:38:08,920
Scott: I thought that one was called something different, but no.

756
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,371
Scott: This is the

757
00:38:09,515 --> 00:38:09,618
Scott: one.".

758
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:15,640
Rym: While voodoo is pretty goddamn sexist, it at least tries to pretend it's not.

759
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:16,400
Scott: Yeah.

760
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:24,739
Rym: And this one was made extra bad, Red Hood and the Outlaws, by the fact that there's that interview in the back of every comic, and they ask the guy who drew Starfire- Oh, really?

761
00:38:25,224 --> 00:38:25,940
Scott: I gotta find this.

762
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,240
Rym: Oh, my.

763
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,599
Rym: Let me read it verbatim.

764
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,500
Rym: Jesus Christ.

765
00:38:28,961 --> 00:38:30,779
Rym: That sold... Oh, it's not... Let me find it.

766
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,240
Rym: Let me pause it.

767
00:38:31,303 --> 00:38:31,660
Scott: Oh, right.

768
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:36,658
Rym: So they ask, "What was your favorite page in this first issue and

769
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:36,919
Rym: why?".

770
00:38:37,102 --> 00:38:37,600
Scott: Oh, let me guess.

771
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,399
Scott: The perverted page.

772
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,840
Rym: So one guy gives a crappy answer.

773
00:38:39,941 --> 00:38:41,319
Rym: I like them all, and I can't choose.

774
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,540
Rym: But Scott says, and I quote- Well, not me, Scott.

775
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:44,936
Rym: Yeah.

776
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:52,540
Rym: Corey, aka Starshine or whatever, stepping out of the ocean, just basking in the sunshine.

777
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,480
Rym: I love the joy on her face.

778
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,020
Rym: The people of this planet may not want her here, but God, how she loves this place.

779
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:03,000
Rym: Now, if you look at that page, none of that is conveyed.

780
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:07,959
Rym: What is conveyed is ridiculous tits, ridiculous ass.

781
00:39:08,928 --> 00:39:09,600
Scott: It's all shiny.

782
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:12,320
Rym: It is amazing to behold.

783
00:39:12,441 --> 00:39:18,714
Rym: And the fact that this guy could say that with a straight face means that he is either a misogynistic pervert or- I think so.

784
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,419
Scott: He's the kind of guy who reads the comics of the TNA and loves it.

785
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:24,416
Scott: And if you question him about it, he'll probably be like, "Yeah, it's fucking

786
00:39:24,537 --> 00:39:24,879
Scott: awesome.".

787
00:39:25,703 --> 00:39:27,020
Scott: He's like, "Superman's drawn all muscly.

788
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,285
Scott: What's the

789
00:39:27,306 --> 00:39:27,511
Scott: problem?".

790
00:39:28,001 --> 00:39:29,420
Rym: This comic makes almost no sense.

791
00:39:29,881 --> 00:39:30,900
Rym: The plot's all over the place.

792
00:39:31,141 --> 00:39:32,419
Rym: Who's that girl with the black eyes?

793
00:39:33,902 --> 00:39:35,499
Rym: What's all this stuff she's talking about?

794
00:39:35,862 --> 00:39:36,960
Rym: Who's that guy who got murdered?

795
00:39:37,105 --> 00:39:37,195
Scott: Yeah.

796
00:39:37,561 --> 00:39:48,351
Scott: Actually, I didn't even notice that those are interviews in the back of these books because it was just like you get to the back of every book and there's the white page with the black text and I thought it was just advertisement copy and I thought it was the same in every book.

797
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,559
Scott: I didn't bother to read them.

798
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:57,239
Scott: So now that I know that there's these sort of interviews in the back, I might go and actually check some of them out just to see if there's other crazy shit like that.

799
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:02,280
Rym: But I'm amazed at how horrible this was just for that.

800
00:40:02,481 --> 00:40:03,598
Scott: This was the worst-.

801
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,319
Rym: I mean, hey, you want to have sex with me because I'm not having sex with my boyfriend right now.

802
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:16,099
Scott: The only things worse than this that I've seen are things like Chewbra and Kiss X Sis and those sorts of things.

803
00:40:17,001 --> 00:40:24,619
Scott: In terms of superhero comics that aren't actually porn, it's almost like actual porn is better in this, right?

804
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,660
Scott: It's just like, ah, it's awful.

805
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:36,200
Rym: I mean, they literally made her a character who will just totally have sex with guys with no strings attached and no consequences- Because she's an alien.

806
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,418
Scott: She doesn't care about having sex.

807
00:40:38,266 --> 00:40:39,740
Rym: And seriously, those are breasts.

808
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:48,100
Scott: Right, but she's an alien, so she's bright orange, but that also happens to be the color of being super tanned and she's in a tropical paradise and she's wearing almost nothing.

809
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:49,450
Scott: And yeah.

810
00:40:50,162 --> 00:40:53,220
Scott: And that's the focus of three or four pages of the book.

811
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,178
Scott: She takes up the whole page.

812
00:40:54,902 --> 00:40:55,859
Rym: It's pretty bad.

813
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:57,439
Scott: It's the worst.

814
00:40:58,684 --> 00:40:59,480
Rym: So Supergirl.

815
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:10,460
Rym: Supergirl is much less scantily clad, although still sort of- I kind of dug the story in that it didn't really give you one.

816
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:17,879
Rym: It kind of set you in the middle of this crazy situation and then Superman appears at the end, but I don't know if I care what the story is.

817
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,762
Scott: No, I mean, most of it was just fighting robots and actually the way it's drawn and the action- Well, it had

818
00:41:22,782 --> 00:41:35,940
Rym: the nice touch of she's basically screaming that she doesn't understand what's going on and all the guys she's fighting are also screaming the same thing, but because they don't speak each other's languages, they're fighting with each other because neither one of them realizes what's happening.

819
00:41:37,803 --> 00:41:40,200
Rym: But I don't know, I'm not sure where this is going.

820
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:49,460
Scott: I kind of liked how they sort of- The thing that always bothers me all the time is when superheroes, superpowers are not used to their maximum extent.

821
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:54,420
Scott: It's like, how come if there's a bad guy, you shouldn't even see Superman coming?

822
00:41:54,461 --> 00:41:55,540
Scott: You shouldn't even talk to him.

823
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,440
Scott: You should just see the bad guy explode like Kenshiro.

824
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,788
Scott: And it won't even be like Kenshiro.

825
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:00,896
Scott: where Kenshiro walks up and goes,

826
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:01,359
Scott: "Wata!".

827
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,580
Scott: It's just, maybe you'll see a blur.

828
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:10,613
Scott: You know, it's just like instantly the bad guy would just explode because Superman is just everywhere on Earth at all times and every bad guy gets punched in the face and that's it.

829
00:42:11,101 --> 00:42:11,819
Scott: But that never happens.

830
00:42:12,181 --> 00:42:26,420
Scott: But in this, they sort of do, you know, when anyone does anything that sort of pushes a superpower to the limit and shows the potential of it, it sort of gets me a little optimistic because she starts hearing things that people are saying really far away.

831
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,960
Rym: Notice how all those things are from all the other new people too.

832
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,420
Scott: From the other comic books.

833
00:42:30,621 --> 00:42:47,640
Scott: She can hear the things that other people are saying in these other 52 with her super hearing and it's like, you know, you would, and I wonder if I hadn't read the other 52, if I had read this very first, would I have known that those things she was hearing were from the other, or even from far away, you know?

834
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:53,980
Scott: It's like, I don't know, but it was still cool whether I knew it or not, but yeah.

835
00:42:54,600 --> 00:43:01,318
Scott: And then, you know, Superman sort of shows up at the end and it's sort of like I was simultaneously happy and sad to see him at the same time.

836
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:08,339
Scott: Because on the one hand, it's like, okay, he's just going to come and fix this bullshit, you know, which is sort of what probably should have happened.

837
00:43:08,921 --> 00:43:11,660
Scott: But B, why can't it just be about Supergirl?

838
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,960
Scott: Why does it also have to be about Super Everyone?

839
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,860
Rym: Why does everything have to be about the Green Lantern?

840
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,477
Scott: Right, so I gave it a meh.

841
00:43:17,942 --> 00:43:18,700
Rym: I also gave it a meh.

842
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:25,820
Rym: And I would read the second one just to find out, but I read the fourth one, I think, and it seems to turn into the same bullshit as everything else.

843
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,540
Scott: So Wonder Woman.

844
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:33,980
Scott: So, I said this before about a billion times, but the cover of Wonder Woman is like the best cover.

845
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,560
Rym: I wish the whole comic looked like that with those thick lines.

846
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,000
Scott: You see this cover and you're just like, oh my god, this is going to be the greatest.

847
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:43,799
Scott: And you know, it's sort of like we have those things today that are like, oh my god, look at this drawing of the X-Men.

848
00:43:44,261 --> 00:43:47,554
Scott: I wish there was a whole X-Men comic that looked like this one drawing and there never is.

849
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:50,100
Scott: This is like, oh my god, look at the cover of this Wonder Woman.

850
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,100
Scott: I wish there was a whole comic that looked like this Wonder Woman.

851
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,817
Scott: Wait a minute, this is on the cover of comic.

852
00:43:54,421 --> 00:43:56,279
Scott: I bet this whole comic looks like, and then it doesn't.

853
00:43:56,462 --> 00:43:57,478
Scott: And it's like, are you kidding me?

854
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:58,758
Scott: Are you kidding me?

855
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,014
Scott: You've used this image of Wonder Woman to advertise the fuck out of the 52 so much.

856
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,540
Scott: And then the inside of the comic doesn't even fucking look like that.

857
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:08,020
Scott: I mean, it looks, you know, close.

858
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:08,699
Rym: It's good.

859
00:44:09,326 --> 00:44:09,920
Rym: It's not bad.

860
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,360
Scott: It's not bad, but it doesn't look like that.

861
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,178
Scott: It's like, ah, dammit.

862
00:44:14,701 --> 00:44:19,300
Rym: But that brought it down from, I'm going to read all this, but you know what?

863
00:44:19,482 --> 00:44:20,420
Rym: I kind of like the story.

864
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:22,879
Rym: I like how it didn't involve a lot of the other superhero BS.

865
00:44:23,402 --> 00:44:24,700
Scott: Yeah, it only involved Wonder Woman.

866
00:44:25,142 --> 00:44:28,819
Rym: And the analogy is kind of in keeping with the whole Wonder Woman thing.

867
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,020
Scott: Yeah, it's like they didn't really exploit Wonder Woman for TNA or anything like that.

868
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:36,460
Scott: But I think it's sort of like they purposefully don't do that, right?

869
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:36,800
Scott: Wait a minute.

870
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,718
Scott: Because it's Wonder Woman.

871
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,917
Rym: That's a dangerous argument to make.

872
00:44:40,581 --> 00:44:42,580
Rym: If they do exploit, it's because they're exploitative.

873
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:45,240
Rym: If they don't exploit, it's because they're trying to pretend they're not exploitative.

874
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:49,240
Scott: And also Wonder Woman is an Amazon, right?

875
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:52,200
Scott: So it's actually did a really good job of drawing her really tall.

876
00:44:54,305 --> 00:44:55,799
Scott: A lot of times people fail to do that.

877
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:59,660
Scott: But it's like you look at Wonder Woman and you're like, damn, she's like seven feet tall.

878
00:44:59,742 --> 00:45:00,659
Scott: Watch the fuck out.

879
00:45:01,341 --> 00:45:01,980
Scott: She's like a giant.

880
00:45:02,021 --> 00:45:02,795
Scott: And she's supposed to be.

881
00:45:03,463 --> 00:45:04,699
Scott: She's defending this other person.

882
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:16,540
Scott: And the thing is, by drawing her that way, it actually not only makes her look as tall as she is and is supposed to be, but actually she sort of explodes off the page because he's so gigantic.

883
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:17,959
Rym: But I dug this.

884
00:45:18,423 --> 00:45:19,499
Rym: I actually want to read the next one.

885
00:45:20,765 --> 00:45:21,060
Scott: Maybe.

886
00:45:21,781 --> 00:45:24,260
Scott: I would definitely want to read it more if it looked like the cover.

887
00:45:25,405 --> 00:45:27,460
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, I give it a high meh.

888
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,440
Scott: I also give it a high meh.

889
00:45:28,481 --> 00:45:29,038
Rym: It's like meh plus.

890
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,539
Scott: Yeah, meh plus, but not good.

891
00:45:31,641 --> 00:45:34,320
Rym: OK, so that actually took a while.

892
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:36,379
Rym: So we're going to not do the fourth week.

893
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,479
Scott: That also happens to be the end of the third week.

894
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:43,320
Scott: We thought we would do them both at once, but we had just so much to say.

895
00:45:43,561 --> 00:45:45,080
Scott: Yeah, we did, I guess.

896
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,419
Scott: Yeah, so let's we'll do week four.

897
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:50,397
Scott: You know, it won't be six months from now.

898
00:45:50,943 --> 00:45:51,618
Rym: It'll be soonish.

899
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:52,676
Scott: And you know what?

900
00:45:53,261 --> 00:45:58,220
Scott: Some of the ones that we said were good, some of them, I'll get the trade and maybe we'll talk about those first trade volumes.

901
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:02,980
Rym: Yeah, any one I said I want to read more of, that means I would read the trade.

902
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,279
Scott: Yeah, like a couple months from now, they're actually going to come out with the hardcover volume ones of some of these.

903
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,760
Rym: So none of these was good enough where I would buy the refuse.

904
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,399
Scott: No, but, you know, a couple.

905
00:46:12,801 --> 00:46:16,480
Scott: So give it like four or five months and you'll start to see some trades of this stuff.

906
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:19,259
Scott: So a trade will usually cover the first six issues of one of these.

907
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:27,840
Rym: So, yeah, this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

908
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:32,958
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando Kay for the logos.

909
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:38,360
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

910
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,280
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

911
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:46,020
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

912
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,536
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

913
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,860
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

914
00:46:54,081 --> 00:46:56,980
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
