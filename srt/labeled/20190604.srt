1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,247
Rym: It's Tuesday, June 4th, 2019.

2
00:00:12,247 --> 00:00:12,729
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:13,972
Rym: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,072 --> 00:00:20,066
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight, Risk of Rain and Risk of Rain 2.

5
00:00:20,066 --> 00:00:21,270
Scott: Should have said Risks of Rain.

6
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:23,116
Rym: That was a better title.

7
00:00:23,497 --> 00:00:24,260
Rym: I ain't going back now.

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,023
Rym: Let's do this.

9
00:00:26,043 --> 00:00:27,809
Rym: So I've been really doubling down.

10
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:29,875
Rym: I've been playing a lot of Overwatch lately.

11
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:30,437
Rym: Okay.

12
00:00:30,818 --> 00:00:36,619
Rym: It's uh, It's hard to express again how much that game is exactly what I want of an FPS.

13
00:00:37,646 --> 00:00:44,800
Rym: But at the same time I'm Finding that I'm getting better, and I think it might be because other people getting worse.

14
00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:52,035
Rym: I think it's because other people are getting worse or not trying as hard or Players leaving so you're up against.

15
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:52,740
Scott: you know lesser.

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,980
Rym: Well, I think it's coupled with the fact that they added this whole system where you can cue for the random cue.

17
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:04,459
Rym: But you can be like I only play tank or me and my friend only play better team comps.

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,871
Rym: Yeah, so I just play straight random.

19
00:01:06,911 --> 00:01:08,580
Rym: I've never used any of that nonsense.

20
00:01:09,082 --> 00:01:16,772
Rym: I just say put me on a team so I get put on a team with a bunch of people who are like I can only play tank and I can only play DPS.

21
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:18,439
Scott: It would actually be a lot easier for me.

22
00:01:19,423 --> 00:01:21,552
Scott: I might almost not I'm not going to.

23
00:01:22,134 --> 00:01:27,597
Scott: but if they had that for MOBAs I might almost play one because part of the like.

24
00:01:27,617 --> 00:01:28,923
Rym: the first problem I have playing a MOBA.

25
00:01:28,943 --> 00:01:30,350
Rym: You don't want to learn every character.

26
00:01:30,812 --> 00:01:33,507
Scott: Well, no is that when I turn a MOBA on It's like I want to pick the character.

27
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,800
Scott: It looks cool like the awesome wizard or some shit.

28
00:01:36,322 --> 00:01:40,960
Scott: It's like you know and you could pick random, but that's no good.

29
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,619
Scott: It's like let someone else pick the good thing that fits on this team for me.

30
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:50,700
Scott: And then if I just keep doing that over and over again that takes a huge knowledge.

31
00:01:52,465 --> 00:01:59,620
Rym: Back when I was like platinum overwatch like when I was actually really good or at least my rank was really good It was partly because I was playing in a group with other good people.

32
00:02:00,063 --> 00:02:09,548
Rym: But the main difference was that those people Would do that work like they'd be like Rym play This kind of shield tank on this map.

33
00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:14,986
Rym: because of this reason that you don't understand and I'd be like, yes, sir Yeah, and I would be great.

34
00:02:15,187 --> 00:02:21,180
Rym: Yeah, but now when I play in like high silver low gold Everyone else on the team is just dumb as bricks.

35
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:26,400
Rym: So I got to be there and be like look you don't play Reaper on this map play Widow.

36
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:27,688
Rym: Oh, you can't snipe fine.

37
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:28,472
Rym: Can anyone snipe?

38
00:02:28,754 --> 00:02:29,800
Rym: Can anyone snipe fine?

39
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,642
Rym: I will snipe.

40
00:02:30,723 --> 00:02:31,225
Rym: you do this.

41
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:33,935
Rym: you do that you two are healers and then we win.

42
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:35,100
Scott: the people actually listen though.

43
00:02:35,702 --> 00:02:36,285
Scott: Actually, they do.

44
00:02:36,486 --> 00:02:36,948
Scott: Oh, that's good.

45
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,335
Rym: The community is like.

46
00:02:39,018 --> 00:02:55,319
Rym: I am Continuously shocked and how good the community is in the actual games when I'm actually talking to human beings in the voice chat Like I'd say one out of ten games has someone who's a piece of shit Compared to counter-strike where it's one out of point five games because there's two shitheads per game.

47
00:02:56,601 --> 00:03:00,760
Rym: Like I'm like they did everything right and I don't know how to make the game more popular.

48
00:03:00,921 --> 00:03:04,280
Rym: I maybe it's just that kind of FPS like kids want to play fortnight.

49
00:03:04,662 --> 00:03:05,445
Scott: Well, I think it's just.

50
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:08,560
Scott: this is a problem for all games that are all multiplayer.

51
00:03:09,062 --> 00:03:12,574
Scott: You know competitive games games that you can just keep playing and playing and playing it with.

52
00:03:12,654 --> 00:03:14,160
Scott: you know ladders and all this stuff.

53
00:03:14,622 --> 00:03:18,040
Scott: They all have this common problem of maintaining player interest.

54
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:30,192
Scott: You can only do the same thing over and over again for so long No matter how Intricate it is and there are some people on earth who can go into that like people who just play chess and they just play Chess forever and they don't get tired of it.

55
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:31,440
Scott: people who play counter-strike forever.

56
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,647
Rym: If that's you still existed that would have been me.

57
00:03:34,029 --> 00:03:36,858
Scott: but the vast majority of people I believe at least it's.

58
00:03:36,918 --> 00:03:42,452
Scott: I think it's clear It's the majority of people Are not like that and they need novelty.

59
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,300
Scott: They need things to get changed and mixed up.

60
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,480
Scott: That's why you know magic needs like expansions and they rotate cards out and they keep shaking things up all the time.

61
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:54,420
Scott: You know character, you know changing things just for the sake of changing so you don't get bored and go to sleep.

62
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:56,218
Scott: And and you're you know, you're done with it, right?

63
00:03:57,121 --> 00:04:08,448
Scott: So it's a challenge for these games because even if you shake your game up Right frequently and I think actually none of them shake things up frequently enough I see no reason to not shake your game or die does?

64
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,600
Scott: no I see no reason not to shake your game up daily.

65
00:04:12,181 --> 00:04:14,760
Rym: Uh for died will sometimes just be like, oh we should.

66
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:17,065
Rym: Why then you then there?

67
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,171
Rym: no meta can evolve.

68
00:04:18,372 --> 00:04:19,115
Scott: why do you need one?

69
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:20,220
Scott: You're not a competitive game.

70
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,423
Scott: You just got to keep interest.

71
00:04:21,704 --> 00:04:24,612
Scott: but the point is no amount of changing of your games.

72
00:04:24,672 --> 00:04:28,601
Scott: meta can compete with brand new game Right.

73
00:04:29,063 --> 00:04:30,487
Rym: It's like but it's like.

74
00:04:30,527 --> 00:04:31,811
Scott: it's like oh they mod it.

75
00:04:31,851 --> 00:04:33,356
Scott: There's a new patch out for this game.

76
00:04:33,557 --> 00:04:34,680
Scott: There's some novelty there.

77
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:36,724
Scott: Oh, this is a completely different game.

78
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:47,132
Scott: That is a hundred percent novel and new in every way shape and actually this gets back to the And then they play it every game until they're done with it and so on.

79
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:49,520
Rym: so look at most of the people are at like A pax playing board games.

80
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:59,075
Rym: They pretty much always play the newest board games like once and then they move on like they want to play new games every time They play a game, but then there's people like us where all right.

81
00:04:59,116 --> 00:04:59,939
Rym: I've learned this game.

82
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,899
Rym: now I want to play it ten times in a row.

83
00:05:02,162 --> 00:05:05,180
Scott: But with the thing is with an online game you need It's.

84
00:05:05,562 --> 00:05:15,600
Scott: you can keep the game going as long as the community is above this critical count And as soon as I mean our counter-strike has been above that count for as long as it's existed.

85
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:18,650
Scott: Well, they kept mixing up and releasing new counter-strike barely.

86
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,014
Rym: Yeah, I mean go.

87
00:05:20,115 --> 00:05:22,997
Rym: it counters like go is not had substantial updates.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,133
Rym: Yeah, I'm saying they added.

89
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:35,112
Rym: they added that Basically fortnight clone into it that sucked anyway, we played it a little bit.

90
00:05:35,152 --> 00:05:35,654
Rym: It was bad.

91
00:05:35,874 --> 00:05:39,143
Scott: I thought that that was a PUBG clone.

92
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,112
Rym: I mean they're all cloning the same thing.

93
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,940
Rym: It's just they added a battle royale anyway.

94
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:46,380
Rym: I feel like the industry is finally realizing that you can't just turn every game into a battle royale.

95
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:51,040
Rym: I'll just let fortnight and PUBG have that space and do something different anyway.

96
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:54,672
Rym: So in some news if you didn't notice isn't this meta?

97
00:05:55,134 --> 00:05:55,715
Scott: this is news.

98
00:05:55,876 --> 00:06:08,093
Rym: okay PAX West badges and hotels went on sale and Liberty weekend 2019. obviously yep Badges are all available except Saturday sold out within like 30 seconds.

99
00:06:08,394 --> 00:06:09,979
Rym: now you might say wasn't 30 seconds.

100
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:14,420
Rym: well Here's the thing you might say no Rym it took 10 minutes, but here's the problem.

101
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,480
Scott: What does it say on the spreadsheet?

102
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,340
Rym: I didn't check the spreadsheet for this time.

103
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,159
Rym: But here's the problem.

104
00:06:18,601 --> 00:06:21,209
Rym: The time to sell out is not the time to sell out.

105
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:25,101
Rym: that is published when the last badge is sold and this turns to Sold out.

106
00:06:25,382 --> 00:06:32,380
Rym: the time to sold out is when the last person enters the queue who will buy the last Saturday badge.

107
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:47,653
Rym: Mmm Debatable because say the queue fills with the people who will buy all the badges within a minute and then Ten minutes later that queue gets to the last person who buys the last Saturday badge.

108
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:52,979
Rym: if you logged in nine minutes After the announcement you could not buy a badge.

109
00:06:53,864 --> 00:06:59,550
Rym: Maybe that's the problem, but more interestingly Saturday's sold out of course and the four days are sold out.

110
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,052
Rym: of course.

111
00:07:00,514 --> 00:07:04,290
Rym: Sunday is running low Mm-hmm like Sunday's run low first.

112
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:09,700
Scott: Sunday is a day, which is Not Monday's a holiday right, but it's still Monday.

113
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,611
Rym: It's a short day and Friday is also the first day.

114
00:07:12,631 --> 00:07:13,554
Rym: so I am a shorter.

115
00:07:13,574 --> 00:07:15,140
Scott: day is a Friday's not shorter.

116
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,513
Rym: It's sorry if people feel like it starts a little later.

117
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:20,928
Rym: doesn't ramp up right away Not shorter in any way.

118
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:22,796
Scott: It's just on a day where people are at work.

119
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:23,760
Scott: It is a vacation day.

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,560
Scott: Yeah, Sunday is because four days now Sunday and Saturday are basically equivalent.

121
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,228
Scott: They are both full days of packs.

122
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:36,480
Scott: Yes at PAX West at least there is no difference between Saturday and Sunday.

123
00:07:36,821 --> 00:07:41,057
Scott: I guess Saturday is just like the more free day than Sunday and just society.

124
00:07:41,077 --> 00:07:44,313
Scott: yeah But they're both complete 100% full.

125
00:07:44,554 --> 00:07:56,395
Scott: don't have to work Full packs hours, so if you are a local person who's planning to go to packs for only one day And not a whole weekend you would only go Saturday or only go Sunday,

126
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:59,858
Rym: so it's interesting though Is that I got into the queue basically instantly yep?

127
00:08:01,062 --> 00:08:03,277
Rym: All the hotels were already sold out.

128
00:08:03,297 --> 00:08:07,177
Scott: well You know exhibitors staff all kinds of other people get them hotels first.

129
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:12,616
Rym: yeah But they were already sold out to a degree that I've never seen before.

130
00:08:12,896 --> 00:08:15,127
Scott: for PAX West well There's a new thing that's being built.

131
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:15,811
Scott: is it ready yet.

132
00:08:16,515 --> 00:08:17,200
Rym: No it didn't look like it.

133
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,130
Scott: There's some digging going on.

134
00:08:18,151 --> 00:08:30,407
Rym: we were there last year But the other thing that's interesting about that is that the hotel registration system was way different and made you put in Contact info like email addresses and names for every person For the past few packs.

135
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:31,631
Rym: is I guess I haven't booked.

136
00:08:31,651 --> 00:08:33,135
Rym: it wasn't for what packs?

137
00:08:33,176 --> 00:08:34,200
Rym: was it where I didn't have to do that?

138
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,509
Scott: I did it for the past packs or two.

139
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,328
Rym: I think for PAX East the previous PAX East I did not have to do that.

140
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,254
Scott: I definitely did.

141
00:08:41,274 --> 00:08:43,788
Rym: I could do it But it did not require me.

142
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:45,939
Scott: I definitely did it for East and South this year.

143
00:08:46,281 --> 00:08:47,547
Rym: Yeah, but I remember the previous ease.

144
00:08:47,808 --> 00:08:50,380
Rym: it didn't force me to put in emails for every person.

145
00:08:50,883 --> 00:08:53,660
Rym: It was just an option so they could check in on their own if they wanted to anyway.

146
00:08:54,315 --> 00:09:02,902
Rym: but It looks like I Suspect what they're gonna do because they also have a bunch of notes about how you gotta have the right names in by July 15th.

147
00:09:03,062 --> 00:09:10,792
Rym: because I think if the same email is in multiple rooms one of those rooms getting cancelled By packs because the hotel sell out so fast.

148
00:09:11,595 --> 00:09:12,560
Rym: so we'll see how that all goes.

149
00:09:13,724 --> 00:09:15,620
Scott: Well, we got two different rooms booked with similar.

150
00:09:16,581 --> 00:09:18,459
Rym: We're gonna have to drop one of them in the next week or two.

151
00:09:18,902 --> 00:09:20,874
Rym: let's decide if we want the Hyatt or the share.

152
00:09:20,955 --> 00:09:24,208
Rym: it's cheaper and The Hyatt's cheaper cuz the Hyatt ain't cheap.

153
00:09:24,249 --> 00:09:25,977
Scott: Oh, no wait the Sheraton's cheaper.

154
00:09:26,318 --> 00:09:28,227
Rym: I forget I don't know how we got that Sheraton.

155
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,292
Scott: Well someone posted online.

156
00:09:29,312 --> 00:09:30,236
Scott: It was like Sheraton's open.

157
00:09:30,256 --> 00:09:34,699
Scott: so I'm like oh, okay Yeah, it seems like we both had Hyatt's and I switched from Hyatt to Sheraton.

158
00:09:34,739 --> 00:09:42,349
Rym: Yep It seems like part of what happened was that there were a lot of rooms available but the rooms were all two people only and Did not cover Monday for some.

159
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:50,463
Scott: apparently though if you you could People were saying that if you booked and they didn't have all the days you needed you could then email them to get the extra Days.

160
00:09:50,746 --> 00:09:52,260
Rym: what weird?

161
00:09:52,923 --> 00:09:54,360
Rym: Anyway, I feel like room blocks.

162
00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:00,260
Rym: Just the whole idea of room blocks for conventions has broken now that demand has far exceeded supply anyway.

163
00:10:00,702 --> 00:10:03,615
Rym: So, uh in other news magfest announced their dates.

164
00:10:03,675 --> 00:10:04,740
Rym: now you can't book hotel.

165
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:10,759
Scott: Yep, it's exactly what everyone would be right after fucking New Year's.

166
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,625
Rym: Yep So you can go to magfest.

167
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,215
Rym: but remember magfest is a weird thing.

168
00:10:15,235 --> 00:10:16,660
Scott: Sorry super magfest.

169
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:23,100
Rym: Yeah, magfest does a complicated thing where you have to pre-register for badges first and then there's a thing to get hotels.

170
00:10:23,442 --> 00:10:35,779
Rym: So if you're a magfest type of person Just watch the magfest website because as you know The hotel for magfest sells out faster than packs and magfest sucks if you don't stay right next to magfest.

171
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:40,120
Rym: Yep So we got some other news that's fun about fortnight, right?

172
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:46,440
Scott: So, you know we talk I bring up this point a lot about how the penalties for cheating need to be severe enough.

173
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:50,900
Scott: And my favorite thing to always say is how many Tour de France's did Lance Armstrong the cheater win?

174
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,549
Scott: Zero, right because the penalty was severe.

175
00:10:53,609 --> 00:10:55,116
Scott: The penalty was you cheated.

176
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:56,080
Scott: Therefore you did not win.

177
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,576
Rym: I mean look at the old days and cotton right in college all shit like punk buster.

178
00:11:01,057 --> 00:11:06,008
Rym: on their pcs They would install third-party Executables didn't know their origin.

179
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,480
Rym: that ostensibly would prevent people from cheating, right?

180
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,378
Scott: So in contrast, I always offer the example of.

181
00:11:11,398 --> 00:11:24,914
Scott: you know The New England Patriots who supposedly probably cheated in various ways over the years But the penalties for those cheats were lost draft picks fine Suspensions from certain number of games but none of their Super Bowls were evoked.

182
00:11:25,014 --> 00:11:30,009
Scott: and in fact during years in which they suffered Penalties they still won the Super Bowl.

183
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:33,240
Scott: Therefore they effectively just paid to win.

184
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,110
Scott: It's like sit out two games and gain an advantage.

185
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:36,792
Scott: to win right.

186
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:39,160
Scott: pay this fine and we'll let you have an advantage.

187
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:39,844
Scott: It's like right.

188
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:40,749
Scott: Yeah, it's just by.

189
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:45,890
Rym: if you really want to punch this guy in the face You're gonna sit in a box for between two and five minutes difference between.

190
00:11:46,312 --> 00:11:48,840
Scott: you inflated the football you deflated the footballs.

191
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:53,895
Scott: therefore you must pay X dollars and Pay X dollars and we'll let you deflate the footballs.

192
00:11:53,915 --> 00:11:54,700
Scott: There is no difference.

193
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:55,060
Scott: Yeah.

194
00:11:55,481 --> 00:12:01,880
Scott: So here we have a case of this exact same thing happening in competitive fortnight except and Ronaldo, right?

195
00:12:03,144 --> 00:12:05,519
Scott: to apparently very good fortnight players.

196
00:12:06,503 --> 00:12:16,219
Scott: Were found cheating during qualifiers of basically the biggest fortnight tournament Apparently where the prize was just like some enormous amount of money or the prize pool was just huge.

197
00:12:17,122 --> 00:12:17,829
Scott: They were cheating.

198
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:18,880
Scott: They were caught cheating.

199
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:21,810
Scott: They were definitely cheating and they were punished for cheating.

200
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,720
Scott: their punishment was that they were banned for I think like two weeks.

201
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:26,270
Scott: Like you can't play any fortnight.

202
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,285
Scott: for two weeks competitively You're out now.

203
00:12:28,325 --> 00:12:37,298
Rym: the manner of their cheating was they were Getting friends to basically join games with them and feed them so they could get whatever they needed to get to qualify faster and easier right?

204
00:12:38,521 --> 00:12:43,080
Scott: So they were banned for two weeks and after the two weeks are up they came back in and qualified.

205
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:44,867
Scott: Yeah, and it's like.

206
00:12:44,887 --> 00:12:48,180
Scott: I think your penalty was not severe enough.

207
00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:50,686
Scott: Also, I assume they didn't cheat when they qua.

208
00:12:50,706 --> 00:12:58,975
Scott: so it's sort of debatable on this right because on the one hand the they supposedly Did not cheat when they came back from being suspended.

209
00:12:58,995 --> 00:12:59,800
Scott: So they are really good.

210
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,187
Scott: Why were they cheating in the first place?

211
00:13:01,307 --> 00:13:03,980
Rym: probably out of laziness right out of laziness is right.

212
00:13:05,072 --> 00:13:07,058
Rym: Watch does these seasons for every season?

213
00:13:07,098 --> 00:13:13,530
Rym: I got to do my 10 ranking matches to fit qualify before I can play again and I would gladly skip those.

214
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:13,852
Rym: Yep.

215
00:13:13,872 --> 00:13:15,140
Rym: I wish they didn't even do that.

216
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,323
Scott: I really really need to.

217
00:13:16,544 --> 00:13:19,312
Scott: we need ranking systems that don't have grinding components.

218
00:13:19,373 --> 00:13:21,198
Rym: But anyway, you hearthstone.

219
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:21,760
Scott: That's right.

220
00:13:22,445 --> 00:13:27,608
Scott: Anyway, the point is they They supposedly qualified without cheating, right?

221
00:13:27,668 --> 00:13:28,189
Scott: Supposedly.

222
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,575
Scott: I don't know they are good, right?

223
00:13:30,595 --> 00:13:31,898
Scott: They're good enough to qualify.

224
00:13:31,918 --> 00:13:51,916
Scott: So Should they be in because they qualified legitimately or Should they be not allowed in and the penalty was not severe enough because they're cheating cheaters and we shouldn't have them around here And that that delegitimizes the whole competition to have such scoundrelous players involved scoundrelous.

225
00:13:52,158 --> 00:13:56,235
Rym: Yes So I got two opposing views on that.

226
00:13:56,356 --> 00:14:10,991
Rym: on one hand That kind of cheating and the message it sends for this light punishment hurts the community and the way to keep the community active engaged and feeling like the game is fair would be to When a pro is caught doing something like that.

227
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:12,880
Rym: They're just banned from professional life.

228
00:14:13,141 --> 00:14:18,278
Rym: Yes, full stop agree on the other side for tonight isn't really a competitive game anyway.

229
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:18,920
Rym: also agree.

230
00:14:19,162 --> 00:14:22,979
Rym: So it doesn't actually matter like who cares.

231
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:28,600
Scott: So I feel like someone cares because how much money is at stake?

232
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:31,113
Scott: So they get what if a cheating cheater gets a?

233
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,440
Scott: get some of those millions.

234
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:36,815
Rym: But they didn't cheat in a way that got them into the World Cup.

235
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:46,182
Scott: I Mean Pete Rose bet on games and was banned from baseball forever, but he didn't cheat to win baseball Necessarily.

236
00:14:46,222 --> 00:14:47,987
Rym: We should Black Sox Fortnite.

237
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:50,434
Rym: That would be so easy to pull off.

238
00:14:51,276 --> 00:14:52,660
Scott: Oh, you want a Black Sox eSports?

239
00:14:52,861 --> 00:14:56,280
Scott: Yeah, we need someone that will let us bet on eSports though.

240
00:14:56,401 --> 00:15:09,100
Scott: Yeah, and I and the only problem with black Bet on eSports, Australia, I guess If anyone knows a place we can legally bet on eSports, we will then illegally bribe the athletes.

241
00:15:09,482 --> 00:15:10,329
Rym: Here's the important thing.

242
00:15:10,571 --> 00:15:17,259
Rym: It cannot be Illegally betting on eSports because you don't try to Black Sox the mob, right?

243
00:15:18,268 --> 00:15:22,523
Rym: Black Sox is you Getting cement?

244
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:29,100
Scott: I need to place legal wagers on the sport and then rig the sport by bribing the e-athletes.

245
00:15:29,281 --> 00:15:32,183
Scott: Yeah being like look you might win this thing You might lose this thing.

246
00:15:32,203 --> 00:15:33,428
Scott: if you win you'll get a million.

247
00:15:33,469 --> 00:15:34,613
Scott: if you lose you'll get what.

248
00:15:34,613 --> 00:15:36,200
Scott: 10,000 is the bottom of the prize.

249
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,556
Scott: 50,000 will give you a hundred thousand no matter what because we're gonna bet for you this to happen.

250
00:15:41,797 --> 00:15:42,580
Scott: you make it happen.

251
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:52,140
Rym: Now the thing I do and I like about this at least like kind of an aside Is that the World Cup of Fortnite is at least doing things right in that they're doing it like golf.

252
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,870
Rym: There is a minimum prize for the last.

253
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,780
Scott: I think I think the prize pool is large enough that they can do it.

254
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,406
Scott: Yeah, right for tonight just has to make a money.

255
00:15:59,467 --> 00:16:02,680
Rym: but eSports needs things like that to avoid some of the exploitative.

256
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,616
Scott: Yeah, there are a lot of yeah, we can go on and on about.

257
00:16:05,656 --> 00:16:11,395
Scott: we talked about this Leads who don't make enough money to live because the you know, even our pros.

258
00:16:11,475 --> 00:16:13,080
Scott: we talked about when magic changed.

259
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,672
Rym: Yeah sports could learn a lot from golf and tennis.

260
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:17,074
Scott: Yep.

261
00:16:17,656 --> 00:16:20,849
Rym: So in some other news You may remember a game.

262
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:21,331
Rym: We never.

263
00:16:21,411 --> 00:16:22,416
Rym: we never talked about it a lot.

264
00:16:22,737 --> 00:16:23,380
Scott: I've even played it.

265
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,767
Scott: I just saw it and heard about it.

266
00:16:24,827 --> 00:16:26,094
Rym: I watch YouTube videos about.

267
00:16:26,114 --> 00:16:30,938
Rym: I watch some videos about it Also, but the best way to experience that game was to listen to Dave and Joel talk about it.

268
00:16:31,842 --> 00:16:35,960
Rym: But the game was called Charles Barkley shut up and jam guy Dan.

269
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,630
Scott: So this this was a basically RPG maker game from like 2008.

270
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,819
Scott: That was just a hilarious joke.

271
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:49,760
Rym: JRPG Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 6 and Shaq food, but in a world where?

272
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,826
Rym: Charles Barkley did the ultimate.

273
00:16:52,866 --> 00:16:53,789
Rym: the chaos dunk.

274
00:16:54,009 --> 00:17:03,485
Rym: Yeah, and it like destroyed a city and it's a Final Fantasy Johnson is like the cop.

275
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:10,746
Rym: basketball is now banned because it's too dangerous and Magic Johnson is like the basketball cop And like it's.

276
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:13,760
Rym: it's a fucking experience like watch this game on YouTube.

277
00:17:14,021 --> 00:17:18,186
Rym: We don't play it right, but they did a Kickstarter If you don't play it when I go.

278
00:17:18,428 --> 00:17:21,528
Rym: there was a Kickstarter to make an unofficial Sequel to it.

279
00:17:21,628 --> 00:17:23,118
Scott: was it made by the people made the first one?

280
00:17:23,382 --> 00:17:25,398
Rym: I don't actually know cuz I didn't care that much.

281
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:31,020
Scott: I do remember seeing I think I remember seeing it at least one gaming event or PAX or something where they had a booth.

282
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:45,609
Rym: Yeah, PAX Prime 2015. the title of the game was actually the magical realms of Tiernanog escape from the Necron 7 Revenge of Kwok Chulam the official game of the movie chapter 2 of the hoops Barkley saga Okay, otherwise known as Barkley - anyway.

283
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:46,592
Scott: They kick-started this game.

284
00:17:46,752 --> 00:17:47,755
Scott: How much money did they raise?

285
00:17:47,856 --> 00:17:49,200
Rym: so I thought it was a lot more.

286
00:17:49,241 --> 00:17:50,032
Rym: They only raised 120 grand.

287
00:17:50,921 --> 00:17:54,854
Scott: That's a lot of money, and that is enough money to make an RPG maker game.

288
00:17:54,995 --> 00:17:59,284
Rym: dude 120 grand It's I mean it's not myself 120 grand.

289
00:17:59,364 --> 00:18:04,180
Scott: I could just like take a year off and make more than one game in RPG maker in that time that is these.

290
00:18:04,361 --> 00:18:09,954
Rym: That is an annual salary For two indie developers who do not live in New York City.

291
00:18:09,974 --> 00:18:18,547
Scott: right if I didn't live in New York City I could take probably at least two or three years off and make several JRPG RPG maker games.

292
00:18:18,607 --> 00:18:20,957
Scott: I live the same quality level as Barkley.

293
00:18:20,977 --> 00:18:21,580
Scott: shut up and Jam.

294
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:25,200
Scott: I would just need the creative talent to write such a masterpiece.

295
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:26,725
Rym: Yeah a game like this.

296
00:18:26,765 --> 00:18:28,290
Rym: the thing is games like this.

297
00:18:28,431 --> 00:18:31,883
Rym: people seem to keep making this mistake like I feel like that homestuck game At the same problem.

298
00:18:32,224 --> 00:18:34,773
Rym: the game itself does not have to be a good game.

299
00:18:35,074 --> 00:18:36,760
Rym: the game does not have to have good mechanics.

300
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,209
Scott: You're not making a game right a lot.

301
00:18:39,229 --> 00:18:40,092
Scott: This is it.

302
00:18:40,272 --> 00:18:42,239
Scott: This is the thing I make it like monkey island.

303
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,460
Scott: right?

304
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,093
Scott: I always complain that people try to make like.

305
00:18:45,394 --> 00:18:46,560
Scott: you know that they're making a movie.

306
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,954
Scott: They're Hollywood people working in the game industry right you know.

307
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:54,712
Scott: and they admit that they like started Careers in film or trying going to film school or something.

308
00:18:54,752 --> 00:18:55,254
Scott: and it's like.

309
00:18:55,616 --> 00:19:00,900
Scott: you know they're making a game And they're focusing on the story and the narrative and all this stuff, and that's perfectly fine, right?

310
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,960
Scott: There's plenty of room in the world for software that entertains via story and art and whatever.

311
00:19:06,342 --> 00:19:13,994
Scott: But it's like if you're not if you're just gonna have a cookie cutter game Just like generic FPS generic JRPG just why even put the game in there?

312
00:19:14,034 --> 00:19:21,916
Scott: just admit that you're a software storytelling mechanism Which many games are now doing like monkey island actually like is an example of that kind of thing.

313
00:19:21,937 --> 00:19:25,378
Rym: there were a lot of menu Options and puzzles that were just jokes yep.

314
00:19:26,322 --> 00:19:32,300
Rym: So I feel like Charles Barkley shot up and jam guide and to Barkley - it's just one of those.

315
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,218
Scott: You should have been that yep, and you could have made that yep.

316
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:48,538
Rym: But I also want to point out that to make a real game $120,000 rounds to Zero dollars to make a triple-a game to make a single-a game is probably 400 grand any number of A's.

317
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:49,681
Scott: you need more money Than that.

318
00:19:49,762 --> 00:19:51,047
Scott: yeah, you should make.

319
00:19:51,248 --> 00:19:53,297
Scott: you can make an indie game with a couple of people.

320
00:19:53,458 --> 00:20:02,599
Rym: our friend Joe just you know tweeted a perfect tweet to point out that she wrote and shipped like six games than the time that this Kickstarter game was in development.

321
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,168
Scott: oh Just saying so oh that's the story.

322
00:20:05,228 --> 00:20:05,569
Scott: is that?

323
00:20:06,091 --> 00:20:08,419
Rym: so yeah the story is this is failed.

324
00:20:09,702 --> 00:20:10,063
Scott: How is it?

325
00:20:10,184 --> 00:20:11,168
Scott: it's just they're not gonna make it.

326
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:14,219
Rym: as far as I can tell the team like fell apart.

327
00:20:15,501 --> 00:20:16,446
Scott: It's gonna give the money back.

328
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:17,351
Rym: No of course not.

329
00:20:17,391 --> 00:20:17,874
Rym: it's Kickstarter.

330
00:20:17,894 --> 00:20:18,879
Rym: You don't give the money back.

331
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:22,819
Rym: Okay, the whole point of Kickstarter is that you don't get your money back.

332
00:20:23,342 --> 00:20:27,519
Rym: Oh, that is like the basis of Kickstarter, so how many Kickstarters am I making tomorrow?

333
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:36,006
Rym: There was that old retro prey for a while was doing a thing where they would look at Kickstarter videos and be like wow This is fake.

334
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,839
Rym: This is clearly a scam.

335
00:20:38,843 --> 00:20:40,299
Scott: So where the scams raising money though?

336
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,822
Rym: Yeah, some bull.

337
00:20:42,062 --> 00:20:48,520
Rym: so they mostly focused on Kickstarters that were obvious scams that just failed to even get the scam money right.

338
00:20:48,962 --> 00:20:49,544
Scott: That's what I figured.

339
00:20:49,564 --> 00:20:56,913
Rym: what happened if I made one, but basically apparently there was a huge team trying to make this game Which is also how do you have a huge team with that amount of money?

340
00:20:57,053 --> 00:20:58,460
Rym: Yeah, unless it's all volunteers.

341
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,926
Rym: But sure what do you use that money for?

342
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:00,187
Rym: like?

343
00:21:00,488 --> 00:21:01,994
Rym: just buy art assets or something.

344
00:21:02,015 --> 00:21:03,722
Scott: you don't need that any money to make the First one.

345
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,010
Scott: why do you money make the second one?

346
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:06,700
Rym: that is an interesting question?

347
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:11,175
Scott: There are a lot of me to buy everyone a copy RPG maker that doesn't cost 120 grand.

348
00:21:11,195 --> 00:21:15,899
Rym: so Kotaku reached out to a lot of the people involved who would not reply.

349
00:21:17,681 --> 00:21:19,909
Rym: The money ran out which is interesting.

350
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,360
Rym: on what hookers and blow according to the Kickstarter upstate?

351
00:21:23,721 --> 00:21:33,399
Rym: Rom one of the guys intends to finish Barkley - Despite his inexperience and only having one part-time coder working on the game with him at the time who made the fucking first one.

352
00:21:36,698 --> 00:21:40,613
Rym: I Feel like the moral is don't kickstart small games like.

353
00:21:40,693 --> 00:21:42,760
Rym: I don't know what to do about this kind of thing.

354
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,005
Scott: I made the first one.

355
00:21:44,407 --> 00:21:47,780
Scott: just make another one an RPG maker just like the first one only different story.

356
00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:55,558
Rym: Yeah, I mean you can read this article to see all the details is this I'm sure there's gonna be a real expose of how this didn't make it.

357
00:21:56,202 --> 00:21:58,557
Rym: But I feel like there's two problems here with this kind of game.

358
00:21:58,758 --> 00:22:06,189
Rym: one Charles Barkley showed up and jam guide n is a lot like the black dynamite Not the blood the black bastard comic.

359
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,180
Rym: the concept itself is funny.

360
00:22:09,021 --> 00:22:10,428
Rym: Nothing else really matters.

361
00:22:11,112 --> 00:22:14,347
Rym: don't even need to execute that well Just like write something funny.

362
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:19,386
Rym: if you're gonna make a sequel to something like that Double down on it being a joke.

363
00:22:19,727 --> 00:22:24,360
Rym: the best example of that ever is haul the RPG human occupied landfill.

364
00:22:24,783 --> 00:22:26,292
Rym: Yeah, that is an RPG.

365
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:27,580
Scott: perfect analogy right there.

366
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,366
Rym: Yeah, you kids don't remember haul.

367
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:33,170
Rym: some always someone's all is pretty obscure in 2019.

368
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:40,604
Rym: Yeah Hall is an RPG in the sense that it is an RPG book that is intended to be consumed the way most RPG books are.

369
00:22:40,925 --> 00:22:42,773
Rym: you read it cover to cover by yourself.

370
00:22:43,014 --> 00:22:48,151
Rym: you imagine running the game You never actually find a group and you never actually play the game even once.

371
00:22:48,171 --> 00:22:48,632
Rym: that's right.

372
00:22:49,294 --> 00:22:53,127
Rym: the hall was just that experience Designed to be that experience.

373
00:22:53,187 --> 00:22:56,237
Rym: I would be shocked if anyone actually played hall people have played.

374
00:22:56,257 --> 00:22:58,124
Scott: ha I wouldn't be shocked Yeah, but I would be.

375
00:22:58,406 --> 00:22:59,370
Rym: I would be a little shocked.

376
00:22:59,751 --> 00:22:59,852
Rym: Okay.

377
00:22:59,892 --> 00:23:00,976
Rym: Have you ever actually read?

378
00:23:01,036 --> 00:23:01,880
Rym: ha ha I read.

379
00:23:02,061 --> 00:23:02,783
Scott: I've read some pages.

380
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:04,529
Rym: It's it's a pretty long time ago.

381
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:21,540
Rym: Yeah, I read haul I read that book in God Before I got to 1990. something yeah but anyway, it's time for Things of the day.

382
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:33,306
Rym: So speaking of scams and games and all that when I was a kid There were real Nintendo games, and then there were clearly not real Nintendo games the action 52 kind of.

383
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:34,489
Scott: everyone could tell that there.

384
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:44,520
Scott: even little kids knew there was something up when there was real Tetris and Tangen Tetris like I remember as a kids very specifically the micro machines NES game.

385
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:56,300
Rym: That was the most fake, but I remember being shocked by it because I rented it to see Because I it was a bootleg game, and I knew it was a bootleg game, but it was actually a really good game.

386
00:23:56,621 --> 00:24:01,224
Rym: It's like the only one Tangen Tetris and micro machine Tetris was.

387
00:24:01,424 --> 00:24:05,240
Scott: I mean it was an okay Tetris, but it still wasn't as good as NES Tetris.

388
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:12,079
Rym: No, it was not as good as NES Tetris, but uh I remember vaguely like seeing this thing.

389
00:24:12,561 --> 00:24:20,664
Rym: But as a kid I saw like I saw so clearly even as a young child that this was just a fake-ass scam To trick parents.

390
00:24:21,407 --> 00:24:23,493
Rym: It's something called the Aladdin deck enhancer.

391
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:27,586
Rym: It is game genie adjacent For more reason.

392
00:24:27,787 --> 00:24:31,879
Scott: I remember maybe seeing an ad for it in a video game magazine, but that's about it.

393
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:33,886
Scott: What did it do?

394
00:24:34,188 --> 00:24:35,637
Rym: so basically the idea was?

395
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:43,640
Rym: Nintendo games are expensive like Zelda 2 was 70 bucks when it came out sure like 70 bucks in 90s dollars.

396
00:24:44,322 --> 00:24:53,160
Rym: So the idea was they would make a cartridge that you'd stick into the Nintendo Mm-hmm, and it had all the common components of the cartridge.

397
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,940
Rym: So every to NES cartridge had all these common components.

398
00:24:57,421 --> 00:25:03,380
Rym: And then you'd stick other mini cartridges into this cartridge and add full games on them.

399
00:25:03,742 --> 00:25:05,540
Rym: But they were cheaper to physically manufacture.

400
00:25:05,702 --> 00:25:07,240
Scott: So it was just basically just ROM chip.

401
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:15,800
Scott: They just physically separated the ROM chips from the rest of the cartridge So that you could just buy ROM chips and swap them in and out and those have cheaper games.

402
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:19,420
Rym: So the pitch was buy this thing for like 40 bucks.

403
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:30,120
Rym: But then all the games you buy for it will play in your Nintendo and those games are between 15 and 20 dollars Instead of the 60 70 dollar first party NES games.

404
00:25:31,043 --> 00:25:38,778
Scott: You know that really makes you think it's like the NES could have included some chips Just fucking in the NES and the less in the cartridge.

405
00:25:38,859 --> 00:25:43,560
Scott: yes But then the NES would have been on extra hundred dollars and the cartridges would have been more importantly.

406
00:25:43,721 --> 00:25:46,713
Rym: Then the NES would have probably been more like the Atari 7800 for technical reasons.

407
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:53,880
Rym: Yeah, anyway, so this is a like pretty thorough history of this fucking thing.

408
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:58,135
Rym: But the TLDR version is that won all the games for it sucked ass.

409
00:25:58,235 --> 00:25:59,480
Rym: Oh, yeah, they got a hundred percent.

410
00:26:00,182 --> 00:26:01,828
Scott: But that's the biggest problem.

411
00:26:01,848 --> 00:26:03,033
Rym: There were a lot of games like this.

412
00:26:03,053 --> 00:26:19,311
Rym: They were the games that like Relatives would buy as gifts like your weird uncle would buy it for you as a gift because it was cheaper than the real NES games like they were aimed at adults who didn't know better, which is a Demographic that has mostly disappeared.

413
00:26:19,351 --> 00:26:26,800
Rym: now that kids just buy their own games directly Like you don't see the fake games except at very very very young kids these days.

414
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:30,900
Rym: But in the 90s fake-ass games like this were a big part of the industry.

415
00:26:31,482 --> 00:26:39,938
Rym: but the Aladdin deck enhancer was particularly notable because it came out as The Super Nintendo was coming out.

416
00:26:41,085 --> 00:26:47,980
Rym: so it couldn't even Fulfill that basic purpose of tricking parents because it was already like mega.

417
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:50,734
Scott: Absolutely have done the same concept for the Super Nintendo.

418
00:26:50,835 --> 00:26:51,800
Rym: That would have been a lot harder.

419
00:26:52,102 --> 00:26:53,431
Scott: I'm sure it would have but a bit possible.

420
00:26:53,733 --> 00:26:54,800
Scott: Yeah, those games look awful.

421
00:26:55,122 --> 00:26:55,685
Rym: Oh, they are.

422
00:26:56,288 --> 00:27:01,619
Rym: the scary thing is apparently these dizzy games Not really worse than like the average NES game.

423
00:27:02,161 --> 00:27:02,563
Scott: I mean that's.

424
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:05,876
Rym: but all the other games on this platform are the worst.

425
00:27:05,896 --> 00:27:06,860
Rym: this Robin Hood game.

426
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,749
Rym: Holy these are like action 52 territory.

427
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:12,117
Rym: Okay, so what do you got?

428
00:27:12,137 --> 00:27:12,739
Scott: What do I have?

429
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,140
Scott: I forget?

430
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:22,520
Scott: Oh, yeah, so here's a video of a bunch of people On a people mover being moved and they are singing a song.

431
00:27:22,821 --> 00:27:26,796
Scott: The song they're singing is to the tune of there's no limit.

432
00:27:27,117 --> 00:27:30,496
Rym: No, no One of my favorite DDR songs.

433
00:27:30,717 --> 00:27:32,985
Scott: Yes But they're.

434
00:27:33,186 --> 00:27:39,014
Scott: they have changed all the lyrics to be to Something to it, right?

435
00:27:39,135 --> 00:27:42,708
Scott: It is clearly in a. It is in a non English language.

436
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:43,872
Scott: I'm sure if we read the comments.

437
00:27:44,053 --> 00:27:47,836
Scott: you could you know under this video You could understand what's happening here.

438
00:27:49,063 --> 00:27:54,638
Scott: But basically they're all dressed as elves of some kind with pointy hats overall.

439
00:27:55,141 --> 00:28:01,140
Scott: They're red green blue and yellow with white shirts underneath and they're drunk.

440
00:28:01,843 --> 00:28:05,901
Scott: They're either drunk or acting like they're drunk, but they're not too drunk Right.

441
00:28:06,303 --> 00:28:11,811
Scott: So basically the story is is that they are I believe soccer fans And I mean that tracks.

442
00:28:12,012 --> 00:28:13,220
Scott: Yes that it makes sense.

443
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:17,418
Scott: I think they're on their way to a game at the airport or something like that.

444
00:28:17,438 --> 00:28:20,318
Scott: and Oh, by the way, there's a snow white at the end.

445
00:28:21,381 --> 00:28:24,489
Rym: The first comment on this video is a plus.

446
00:28:25,051 --> 00:28:27,777
Rym: never saw this version of snow white and the hundred dwarves.

447
00:28:27,878 --> 00:28:34,059
Rym: Yeah under it pornhub has and then nasty hobbits.

448
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:55,478
Scott: So basically, the deal is these two brothers who play soccer and their last name is today and And Basically, they played together and people created this chant and would sing this chant right when they're right when they're out there And I think the chant sort of lasted longer than the brothers.

449
00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:59,335
Rym: possibly I feel like the chant is entering the same channel as well.

450
00:28:59,355 --> 00:29:04,093
Scott: the chant outlived Those two people who had the name and became a thing of its own.

451
00:29:04,113 --> 00:29:07,588
Rym: Well, like Potvin sucks Exactly largely.

452
00:29:07,609 --> 00:29:11,046
Scott: This is a pot van sucks of The soccer team.

453
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:17,110
Rym: props to these for them for the to this flash mob for being so organized like it as they are.

454
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:23,470
Scott: incredibly it's a thing of the day because of the level of What's it called.

455
00:29:23,835 --> 00:29:29,677
Rym: watch it Coordination watch it all the way to the end because it is slid escalates in a linear fashion, right?

456
00:29:30,138 --> 00:29:38,563
Scott: They're so coordinated in their effort and also like so over the top like they put way more into this than Anyone should.

457
00:29:38,784 --> 00:29:46,149
Rym: yeah, like take the most elaborate like cosplay Nonsense crap you've seen at an anime con.

458
00:29:46,731 --> 00:29:49,340
Rym: This is way more organized than that.

459
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,283
Scott: Yeah, I've never seen it.

460
00:29:50,443 --> 00:29:52,551
Scott: You know, I've seen cosplay groups at anime cons.

461
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:53,895
Scott: do stuff never like.

462
00:29:53,935 --> 00:29:55,280
Scott: that's a hundred dwarves.

463
00:29:56,429 --> 00:30:01,470
Rym: right in the moment the GeekNights book club book was pages of pain.

464
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,940
Scott: I have Consumed all of the painful pages.

465
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,850
Scott: There are no painful pages left in my future.

466
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:14,588
Rym: and the one thing that I remembered about this book that Surprised me was that I remembered.

467
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,896
Rym: Oh, they meet the demon and then it's over.

468
00:30:16,936 --> 00:30:18,300
Rym: pretty much it actually goes on.

469
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:24,951
Scott: There's a lot more after they meet car for they made the demon about 75 60 something percent of the way 65 75 percent way through.

470
00:30:25,152 --> 00:30:28,021
Rym: I remembered as a kid that like the book ends pretty quick after that.

471
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:45,489
Rym: but what really happens is the pace of the shit going on just Accelerates and gets more and more Disturbing anyway, but the other thing that I remembered that I've remembered accurately like very accurately was the Ridiculous abruptness with which the situation resolves.

472
00:30:46,251 --> 00:30:49,375
Rym: It is just like we're going to go to go to go to go to go to go and pop.

473
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:51,632
Rym: You're done pretty much.

474
00:30:51,693 --> 00:30:53,326
Rym: Good job Good luck.

475
00:30:53,366 --> 00:30:57,959
Rym: Have fun with the rest of your fucking life Those of you who may have survived.

476
00:30:58,643 --> 00:31:01,555
Rym: So we'll be talking about this on the next Thursday's show.

477
00:31:01,575 --> 00:31:02,640
Rym: I'll talk about the book club.

478
00:31:02,841 --> 00:31:07,900
Rym: So if you haven't read it read it because we are not going to explain the plot of this book to you.

479
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,950
Rym: We're going to react to it assuming you have read enough.

480
00:31:11,031 --> 00:31:12,716
Scott: I can't explain the plot of this book to you.

481
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:21,420
Rym: I All I will say is that I feel like I can read a lot into it But I don't know if Troy Denning intended all of that.

482
00:31:22,002 --> 00:31:30,428
Rym: I can I can weave a narrative but like with ikuhara and Gio Saito with utenna like it's clear They intended these things to be read with this.

483
00:31:30,448 --> 00:31:32,854
Rym: I feel like if I try to read it too deeply.

484
00:31:32,874 --> 00:31:39,354
Rym: I am putting way more Craft into this book than it has anyway, but we read it.

485
00:31:39,374 --> 00:31:45,177
Rym: It is the first and probably last Officially canon Dungeons & Dragons licensed novel.

486
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:45,780
Scott: should I pick it?

487
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:49,322
Scott: There's a lot of officially canon licensed novels at the at the bookstore I could.

488
00:31:49,362 --> 00:31:53,708
Scott: this is like battle tech and x-men Battle tech book.

489
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:55,080
Scott: halo has books.

490
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:59,218
Rym: I mean you can do one cuz I may have a whole pile of netrunner license books.

491
00:31:59,298 --> 00:32:00,886
Rym: Oh god I mean I made you read this.

492
00:32:00,946 --> 00:32:03,760
Rym: so I guess I can't complain if you made me read like the netrunner book.

493
00:32:04,461 --> 00:32:05,429
Scott: But I don't know.

494
00:32:05,611 --> 00:32:06,418
Scott: I haven't read any books.

495
00:32:06,822 --> 00:32:08,034
Scott: Just have them because they were like a dollar.

496
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:15,291
Rym: like one thing I know is that if you that's the only reason I have them if you make me read one of those books I will take solace in the fact that you two have to read it.

497
00:32:15,311 --> 00:32:17,722
Scott: I Own it.

498
00:32:18,325 --> 00:32:20,759
Rym: I know I know what my next books gonna be.

499
00:32:22,781 --> 00:32:27,499
Rym: Okay, I'm gonna go in a completely different direction all right like way different direction.

500
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:29,983
Rym: sure It's a book.

501
00:32:30,003 --> 00:32:30,846
Rym: I doubt you've read to.

502
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:33,015
Rym: probably actually it's one of two books.

503
00:32:33,075 --> 00:32:34,240
Scott: I haven't read most books.

504
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,069
Rym: I too have not read most books.

505
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,726
Rym: I Why almost started.

506
00:32:39,786 --> 00:32:40,187
Rym: what was I?

507
00:32:40,248 --> 00:32:51,773
Rym: I was skimming through a bunch of novels and stuff, and I flipped through a one of the earlier prince of nothing books because I wanted to find a quote and I had this urge to just read the darkness that came before again.

508
00:32:51,793 --> 00:32:52,596
Rym: Go ahead.

509
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,799
Rym: I gotta I gotta avoid that.

510
00:32:54,761 --> 00:32:55,905
Rym: So anyway, let's get into it.

511
00:32:55,985 --> 00:33:00,320
Rym: risk of rain was a game that I played it like twice at go Joe's house.

512
00:33:00,581 --> 00:33:07,359
Scott: I played this game when it came out on my PC solo for a few days, and then I forgot about it.

513
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,631
Rym: Yep, and then we tried.

514
00:33:08,672 --> 00:33:09,440
Rym: we played it a bunch.

515
00:33:09,963 --> 00:33:17,898
Scott: I played it quite a bit because when we opened it up just yesterday I had like four of the whatever number of characters unlocked and stuff.

516
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:22,920
Rym: yep I had nothing unlocked despite the fact that I own this game, and it said I played it for like an hours.

517
00:33:23,142 --> 00:33:32,150
Scott: I don't know was yeah I didn't actually look at steam to see how many hours I played it But I did play it quite a bit for a short period of time Maybe a week or maybe two weeks at most and then that was it.

518
00:33:32,592 --> 00:33:48,339
Scott: so risk of rain one was an indie game That was made very cheaply by a couple of people and the concept of the game at the time was basically Sort of it was one of the earlier games to combine roguelike nature with other genres And so it's a plat.

519
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:55,700
Scott: It's a shooter platform roguelike imagine sort of like Contra right, but the controls are nothing like Contra.

520
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,429
Scott: It's still a platform where you have guns and shoot things.

521
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:03,365
Scott: you also have four different abilities sort of like a moba Right bound to four buttons in a row.

522
00:34:03,385 --> 00:34:12,996
Scott: I think the four abilities of the main guy are like yeah regular gun roll Rapid fire gun and armor piercing like single shot.

523
00:34:13,036 --> 00:34:15,650
Scott: Yeah, and single shot That's like powerful right or something like that.

524
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:16,414
Scott: stuns a little bit.

525
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:17,058
Scott: Maybe I don't know.

526
00:34:17,158 --> 00:34:19,368
Scott: yep And you could jump and stuff like that.

527
00:34:19,388 --> 00:34:22,400
Rym: It's got like a really floaty feel like little guys.

528
00:34:23,402 --> 00:34:31,607
Scott: Big problem with the game is that everything is really really tiny which I like in Theory, but in practice right.

529
00:34:31,647 --> 00:34:33,893
Scott: so I think I read about it, and it was.

530
00:34:33,914 --> 00:34:41,219
Scott: it was done intentionally obviously Yeah Because they wanted to make the to feel you know story-wise like you don't belong on this world.

531
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,149
Scott: You're some human who landed here or human ish thing.

532
00:34:44,188 --> 00:34:45,734
Scott: I guess that landed here.

533
00:34:45,774 --> 00:34:46,596
Scott: You don't belong here.

534
00:34:46,657 --> 00:34:47,739
Scott: everything here is enormous.

535
00:34:48,262 --> 00:34:51,054
Scott: You're tiny right and they couldn't really.

536
00:34:51,074 --> 00:34:56,900
Scott: they didn't have the money or the art Assets or anything in the first game to actually make big stuff like say shadow of the colossus.

537
00:34:57,401 --> 00:35:01,674
Scott: So they just made you really small yeah to get that feel and they succeeded in getting that feel.

538
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:05,279
Scott: they made the game very inaccessible And difficult to play.

539
00:35:05,862 --> 00:35:08,514
Scott: People who can't don't have amazing vision cannot play.

540
00:35:08,554 --> 00:35:09,297
Scott: risk of rain one.

541
00:35:09,338 --> 00:35:09,880
Scott: It's just impossible.

542
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,767
Rym: You know I played it at why I tried it at work.

543
00:35:11,847 --> 00:35:15,640
Scott: several articles online about people like I risk of rain one is unplayable.

544
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,647
Scott: I can't see yep now.

545
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:19,342
Rym: I had no problem with it, and I played it in Vision.

546
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:19,844
Scott: I could play.

547
00:35:19,904 --> 00:35:22,732
Rym: I played it in 1x scaling on a 4k monitor.

548
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:27,209
Rym: that shit is like 1 millimeter tall Right and that was fine right.

549
00:35:27,229 --> 00:35:27,571
Scott: so basically.

550
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:28,456
Scott: It's a platforming game.

551
00:35:28,476 --> 00:35:29,139
Scott: you shoot guys.

552
00:35:29,584 --> 00:35:30,999
Scott: Everything has health like HP.

553
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,351
Scott: So you don't just shoot a guy and they die like say contra.

554
00:35:33,432 --> 00:35:35,100
Scott: yeah, you sort of have to like whittle the eyes down.

555
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:35,785
Scott: It's more like.

556
00:35:35,986 --> 00:35:37,780
Rym: it's more like Borderlands in that regard.

557
00:35:38,001 --> 00:35:42,093
Scott: Yeah, exactly right where you sort of you know remove your stats matter a little.

558
00:35:42,334 --> 00:35:44,140
Scott: also in addition to your skills mattering.

559
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,164
Rym: Yeah, you can get items.

560
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,007
Rym: They're all kind of random.

561
00:35:46,027 --> 00:35:49,240
Rym: They all do kind of random stuff yep, but it's roguelike.

562
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,513
Scott: So the way it works is obviously once you die It's game over you to start over.

563
00:35:52,533 --> 00:35:54,588
Scott: in the beginning You spawn in a level.

564
00:35:54,728 --> 00:35:57,020
Scott: you can go up and down and left and right and all over it.

565
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:58,185
Scott: It's not directional.

566
00:35:58,205 --> 00:36:02,100
Scott: you explore the level sort of Metroid II, but it's not a maze.

567
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:09,347
Scott: It's just like a big open space with platforms and things you have to get over and things like that And you're looking for the teleporter.

568
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:16,924
Scott: when you find the teleporter you activate it and as long as you stay close enough to the teleporter It's sort of like you know Builds up to 100%.

569
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:22,047
Scott: after you activate it once it hits 100% You're sort of good, and you can leave the level.

570
00:36:22,087 --> 00:36:25,860
Scott: you also have to kill all the enemies that are that are left, right?

571
00:36:25,941 --> 00:36:27,500
Scott: It'll be like oh, there's five enemies left.

572
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:37,540
Scott: You can't exit a level and you get you get to fight like a kind of a boss thing And before you activate the teleporter enemies are basically constantly spawning all the time.

573
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,133
Scott: They actually don't stop spawning until that teleporter hits 100% all right.

574
00:36:40,173 --> 00:36:45,012
Rym: now There's a very important like that And I think this is sort of a point where we'll talk about.

575
00:36:45,052 --> 00:36:46,219
Rym: with both this and risk of rain, too.

576
00:36:46,942 --> 00:36:51,235
Rym: There's a lot of unique or like very interesting mechanics.

577
00:36:51,496 --> 00:36:56,740
Rym: Oh, yeah, but They don't really gel together into a fun game and risk of rain one.

578
00:36:57,122 --> 00:37:01,962
Rym: but this one mechanic is that the monsters keep spawning and there's difficulty level as Time goes on.

579
00:37:02,103 --> 00:37:05,233
Rym: you just see this meter and the difficulty just slowly getting higher.

580
00:37:05,293 --> 00:37:07,480
Scott: the difficulty is always increasing with time.

581
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:11,020
Scott: If you just stand still the game gets harder and harder and harder and harder.

582
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:12,799
Scott: So you have this time pressure?

583
00:37:13,241 --> 00:37:17,555
Scott: That's saying go go go find that teleporter hit it and get to the next level.

584
00:37:17,816 --> 00:37:20,905
Scott: while the game is still easy You will get further in the game.

585
00:37:20,965 --> 00:37:25,096
Scott: that way if you sit around because it is a stateful roguelike.

586
00:37:25,136 --> 00:37:36,994
Scott: if you sit around collecting money Collecting items powering yourself up getting all sorts of drones to help you out Which are really fun because you don't have to deal with them They just either shoot for you getting really powerful stuff.

587
00:37:37,034 --> 00:37:41,732
Scott: the more you sit around The harder the game will be to match your grinding.

588
00:37:41,772 --> 00:37:43,278
Scott: so you have to sort of.

589
00:37:43,378 --> 00:37:44,900
Scott: it's not you know It's sort of grinding.

590
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:56,520
Scott: But if you're gonna like go out of your way to not look for the teleporter and say collect a bunch of loot and money You better be collecting loot and money at a rate greater than the difficulty of the game is getting higher.

591
00:37:57,081 --> 00:38:04,801
Scott: Right, you need to sort of outpace the difficulty meter with your pat with how much you power yourself up so that the game remains Easy.

592
00:38:04,842 --> 00:38:12,817
Scott: because even if the game gets like middle medium or hard difficulty if you manage to collect enough powerful shit The game will still be basically easy for you.

593
00:38:12,838 --> 00:38:18,183
Scott: Yeah But if you rush through the game super fast Okay, great.

594
00:38:18,203 --> 00:38:22,440
Scott: You got to level three, and you're still only on medium difficulty, but you didn't stop to collect any stuff.

595
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:29,538
Scott: It's now the game actually is medium difficulty Yeah, and once it gets the hard you're just gonna die right because you didn't get enough stuff.

596
00:38:29,578 --> 00:38:31,480
Scott: You're weak You don't have your goods now.

597
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,143
Rym: I'm not gonna lie like.

598
00:38:32,163 --> 00:38:35,600
Rym: the game is clever and has a lot of really good stuff going for it.

599
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,243
Scott: Yeah, it was.

600
00:38:36,364 --> 00:38:38,980
Rym: I remember it actually find it fun.

601
00:38:39,141 --> 00:38:45,130
Scott: I remember it being way fun when I played originally But playing it now it was less fun than I remember it being.

602
00:38:45,451 --> 00:38:48,860
Rym: yeah like the the accessibility problem did not affect us at all.

603
00:38:48,921 --> 00:38:59,747
Rym: it's more just The combat is not actually that interesting because the a lot of it is a lot of really random and they're kind of random Crap, it's mostly passive upgrades.

604
00:38:59,767 --> 00:39:09,080
Rym: like there are some cases where you choose a lot of stores where it's like choose one of these three Items yeah, but like most of the powers is you do more damage in some like vague capacity.

605
00:39:09,502 --> 00:39:11,329
Rym: They don't really give you more options.

606
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,300
Scott: some of them give you interesting different ways to handle different enemies.

607
00:39:14,523 --> 00:39:15,860
Rym: I think I got was cool.

608
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,695
Scott: Yes, some items might make it easier to deal with flying enemies.

609
00:39:19,078 --> 00:39:21,320
Scott: some items I make it easy to do with ground enemies.

610
00:39:21,521 --> 00:39:25,140
Scott: Right you might fight in a different way as if you choose a different character.

611
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,315
Scott: Then you definitely play in a drastically different way, but you start with nothing unlocked.

612
00:39:29,376 --> 00:39:31,845
Rym: so when I started playing the game again I only have one dude unlocked.

613
00:39:31,865 --> 00:39:32,829
Rym: so the game wasn't actually like.

614
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,360
Scott: there was a cut sort of like FTL unlock in different ships.

615
00:39:35,721 --> 00:39:37,887
Rym: Use everything immediately right.

616
00:39:37,928 --> 00:39:41,257
Scott: when you use a different ship in FTL you play the game differently.

617
00:39:41,318 --> 00:39:46,460
Scott: yep, right Right if you're the rock boys you play the game a lot differently than if you're human.

618
00:39:48,308 --> 00:39:57,268
Rym: I do not have time to wait for a game to to Immediately dole out like oh the fears the fun part of the game But when you play with different characters and risk of rain.

619
00:39:57,288 --> 00:40:12,859
Rym: you play the game differently because their abilities are so different But I would argue not differently enough Because the Combat just comes down to DPS and the monster is just sort of swarm Depends on which level you're in.

620
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,027
Scott: It feels very samey in a hurry.

621
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:22,660
Scott: Oh, you know also one of the core things about this game that puts it a separate from the other ones is the co-op action.

622
00:40:22,761 --> 00:40:32,551
Scott: Right you can do local or online and multiplayer Co-op where you and all your friends are all rogueliking together Plus you all spawned at the same time.

623
00:40:32,612 --> 00:40:34,660
Scott: if someone dies they're dead permanently.

624
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,446
Scott: oh the rest of you keep going.

625
00:40:36,828 --> 00:40:41,704
Scott: you can sort of share your gold and your items to some extent and You know and there are.

626
00:40:41,845 --> 00:40:44,037
Scott: imagine you can play net hack where someone else is in there with you.

627
00:40:44,057 --> 00:40:44,559
Scott: That'd be great.

628
00:40:45,522 --> 00:40:47,779
Scott: I'm sure there are roguelikes like that, but I haven't played them.

629
00:40:48,243 --> 00:40:55,679
Rym: But I guess in the end like the best thing I can say about it Is there's a lot of good ideas and an okay execution, and it's a good like proof of concept.

630
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:56,724
Scott: Yeah Yeah, it was definitely.

631
00:40:56,744 --> 00:40:59,137
Scott: you know it was big and for a reason right.

632
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:02,532
Scott: you know I mean it's bigger than it was was worth right it out.

633
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,380
Scott: it outperformed its develop.

634
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,368
Scott: You know its development right now.

635
00:41:06,429 --> 00:41:13,877
Rym: notably it was developed by hopu games But it was published by of all people chucklefish mm-hmm the same company that did.

636
00:41:13,997 --> 00:41:20,879
Rym: they were a publisher But and they I guess they still are a publisher, but they also they independently developed wargroove, okay?

637
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,764
Scott: Indie games going on.

638
00:41:22,985 --> 00:41:24,733
Scott: yeah anyway, so risk of rain.

639
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:30,860
Scott: 2 is currently in early access But it's not one of those early access situations where it's like oh, it's so early.

640
00:41:30,961 --> 00:41:32,800
Scott: It's like you're playing some alpha garbage game.

641
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:38,649
Scott: It's like no it's like when minecraft was beta and everyone was playing it, and it's like yeah Yeah, it's out if they're just calling it beta.

642
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:39,874
Scott: It's like Gmail was beta.

643
00:41:39,934 --> 00:41:42,828
Scott: right it's one of those situations And it's basically like.

644
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:48,256
Rym: it's kind of shocking when you play it like you look at some menus And you realize it's the exact same game, but in 3ds.

645
00:41:48,397 --> 00:41:53,940
Scott: Yes Yeah, it's like it's when I usually when I see a sequel to a game take a massive turn like that.

646
00:41:54,404 --> 00:42:01,007
Scott: It's sort of like hey You're going in a weird direction sort of like Nidhogg.

647
00:42:01,292 --> 00:42:09,195
Scott: yeah Yeah, Nidhogg you see Nidhogg 2 and you're like oh, man I just wanted more Nidhogg 1 and you're going to this other direction.

648
00:42:09,215 --> 00:42:10,400
Scott: god damn it right.

649
00:42:10,902 --> 00:42:14,654
Scott: But risk of rain 2 they it's basically risk of rain.

650
00:42:14,654 --> 00:42:16,882
Scott: 1 is now risk of rain 2.

651
00:42:16,882 --> 00:42:19,212
Scott: It's just the same game third-person shooter.

652
00:42:19,694 --> 00:42:19,935
Scott: Yep.

653
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:20,477
Scott: That's it.

654
00:42:20,879 --> 00:42:28,165
Rym: otherwise It's almost exactly the same game which weird is how much of a same game It is like.

655
00:42:28,508 --> 00:42:30,100
Rym: it feels very similar.

656
00:42:30,301 --> 00:42:31,465
Scott: There's the same.

657
00:42:31,485 --> 00:42:32,007
Scott: you know you.

658
00:42:32,127 --> 00:42:35,780
Scott: you get money by shooting guys guys spawn all over the place.

659
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,588
Scott: You're searching for the teleporter a giant boss spawn.

660
00:42:38,608 --> 00:42:42,780
Rym: It's the same monsters with the same attacks just in three dimensions.

661
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,242
Scott: It's like.

662
00:42:43,362 --> 00:42:45,410
Scott: it's like this jellyfish and risk of rain 1.

663
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:47,980
Scott: Oh look his jellyfish in 3d coming at you, right?

664
00:42:48,463 --> 00:42:57,865
Scott: They made the same exact goddamn game the same four abilities for the main character, it's like wow it's Literally, it's you know you think I'll.

665
00:42:57,885 --> 00:42:59,831
Scott: Mario 64 is just Mario in 3d.

666
00:42:59,931 --> 00:43:02,700
Scott: not really it's different in a lot of ways, right?

667
00:43:03,241 --> 00:43:08,259
Scott: It's like this is the same goddamn game and notably they moved on.

668
00:43:08,782 --> 00:43:11,032
Rym: Gearbox published this instead of Chucklefish.

669
00:43:11,434 --> 00:43:12,419
Scott: Oh, yeah, okay?

670
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,334
Rym: Yeah, it's gonna officially come out in spring of 2020 so next year.

671
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:28,476
Rym: the only problem with it is that playing it a bunch I Feel the same things I felt playing risk of rain one, but so interesting.

672
00:43:28,556 --> 00:43:29,620
Rym: This is a tech demo.

673
00:43:30,162 --> 00:43:30,523
Rym: It's not.

674
00:43:30,563 --> 00:43:32,890
Rym: it's fun, but it's not that fun.

675
00:43:33,312 --> 00:43:40,715
Scott: I think the main problem with it is That the the core mechanic is fun right.

676
00:43:40,796 --> 00:43:43,445
Scott: It's like playing a roguelike shooting.

677
00:43:43,991 --> 00:43:48,709
Scott: getting stronger Balancing speed versus getting power-ups and money.

678
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:50,333
Scott: all that stuff is great.

679
00:43:50,774 --> 00:43:59,162
Scott: the thing is is that the actual Abilities and weapons and the actual combat of the game not that fun It's not.

680
00:43:59,243 --> 00:44:02,440
Scott: actually all I do is point towards enemies and hold the thing down.

681
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,745
Rym: It just don't even matter.

682
00:44:03,846 --> 00:44:06,858
Scott: watch their health meter go down and hope that it goes down faster.

683
00:44:07,742 --> 00:44:08,770
Rym: It's just in that regard.

684
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:10,240
Rym: It's just where's Borderlands right?

685
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:17,050
Scott: It's like the actual running around jumping and shooting action part of the game Is not exciting or fun.

686
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:19,139
Scott: It's just sort of like it feels very save me.

687
00:44:19,561 --> 00:44:33,087
Rym: I'm holding down the mouse button and running while hoping guys die fast enough like the monsters all kind of swarm you in this generic way like their behaviors aren't that interesting and Half the game was wait.

688
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:34,291
Rym: What is damaging me?

689
00:44:34,693 --> 00:44:34,934
Scott: Yep?

690
00:44:35,074 --> 00:44:35,295
Scott: Wait?

691
00:44:35,335 --> 00:44:36,439
Rym: What's damaging me now?

692
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,830
Scott: Like it it's like if you get engaging.

693
00:44:39,931 --> 00:44:44,307
Scott: when you're engaging say one enemy at a time They have some behaviors that it's like.

694
00:44:44,327 --> 00:44:47,940
Scott: okay that guy shoots a red laser, so I have to dodge at this exact moment.

695
00:44:48,292 --> 00:45:03,440
Scott: Okay That bad guy like makes a sphere and if you get stuck in it if you don't run out of the sphere quickly enough you Get frozen, but then like there's 30 flying skulls individually the enemies are interesting But this just eventually a giant mob of enemies everywhere.

696
00:45:03,602 --> 00:45:11,580
Scott: So it's like you can't engage You know in with that interesting mechanic of a single enemy because just you're taking damage from all over the fuck.

697
00:45:11,701 --> 00:45:13,479
Scott: Yeah, run run run run run.

698
00:45:14,026 --> 00:45:15,099
Rym: Just kite and shoot.

699
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,426
Rym: That's the whole game kite and shoot.

700
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:28,940
Scott: aim at the closest enemy while holding using your abilities waiting for them to refresh using them again immediately as soon as they refresh and Hoping that enough guys die and you live until the boss is dead and the teleporter lets you go to the next level.

701
00:45:29,251 --> 00:45:30,316
Scott: Yeah Repeat it again.

702
00:45:30,901 --> 00:45:36,720
Scott: Use all your money on all the shops as much as you can to get stuff and the environment on your way to find the teleporter.

703
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:40,232
Rym: But that like the loop of gameplay is the same.

704
00:45:40,352 --> 00:45:48,000
Rym: every level is just wander around you find the teleporter There is no rhyme or reason to like where you might find the teleporter and there is nothing interesting.

705
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,948
Scott: Yeah, the levels are some sort of mix between Handcrafted and procedurally generated.

706
00:45:53,988 --> 00:45:54,951
Scott: they're boring.

707
00:45:55,272 --> 00:45:56,938
Scott: Yeah, there's not much going on.

708
00:45:56,958 --> 00:45:59,638
Scott: It's just like, okay It's some sort of you know ruined.

709
00:46:00,141 --> 00:46:07,776
Scott: Let me run in a spiral until I find the teleporter some stuff on it And I'm just kind of running around and moving as fast as I can looking for the.

710
00:46:07,896 --> 00:46:10,044
Scott: you know, yeah It's like you walk slow.

711
00:46:10,104 --> 00:46:12,030
Scott: There's a run fast button for sprinting.

712
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:15,300
Scott: I'm just sprinting all the time and it's not fast enough either.

713
00:46:15,621 --> 00:46:19,799
Scott: No, I mean, I guess it would be too easy if it was fast because you'd find the teleporter right away, right?

714
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,166
Rym: But the only thing that was actually in.

715
00:46:22,206 --> 00:46:24,794
Rym: the bosses were pretty interesting at first like they're.

716
00:46:25,176 --> 00:46:25,757
Rym: they're really.

717
00:46:25,777 --> 00:46:27,043
Scott: you almost wish It's like.

718
00:46:27,063 --> 00:46:29,360
Scott: I know it's sort of the point of the game.

719
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:32,480
Scott: They're like, okay the boss spawns and there's still guys swarming everywhere.

720
00:46:32,982 --> 00:46:33,885
Scott: But it'd be more interesting.

721
00:46:33,905 --> 00:46:35,190
Scott: just engage the boss alone.

722
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:37,218
Scott: Yeah, you know, I don't know.

723
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:44,384
Rym: but as a result Like I'll play it a little more because I want to see like how it evolves because it's still early access and it is still Like buggy is shit.

724
00:46:44,404 --> 00:46:46,112
Rym: There's a lot of like just bugs.

725
00:46:46,373 --> 00:46:47,920
Scott: I'm sure they'll add way more to it.

726
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:53,313
Rym: You know if they're not like one very specific thing I was trying to bind mouse and keyboard and they have a lot of good stuff like.

727
00:46:53,373 --> 00:46:54,679
Rym: invert mouse is an option.

728
00:46:55,482 --> 00:46:58,800
Rym: No one else needs it, but they added horizontal invert mouse.

729
00:46:58,921 --> 00:47:01,219
Scott: I don't know why you would have horizontal invert mouse as a mag.

730
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,029
Rym: You know what that is?

731
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:02,818
Rym: You know who wants that?

732
00:47:04,563 --> 00:47:07,139
Rym: Warim warim warim needs horizontal mouse mirroring.

733
00:47:09,102 --> 00:47:10,907
Scott: Yeah, there are other characters like.

734
00:47:11,047 --> 00:47:19,410
Rym: I tried to bind some keys and if certain keys if you bound them to a button Would unbind other unrelated.

735
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:21,837
Scott: use the default fucking keys and get used to it.

736
00:47:21,877 --> 00:47:25,289
Rym: Whatever it is Well, it's why why not change.

737
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:26,975
Rym: I I have a mouse with a bunch of buttons.

738
00:47:27,036 --> 00:47:28,059
Rym: I'd like to bind.

739
00:47:29,001 --> 00:47:30,915
Scott: Normal mouse doesn't have too many buttons on it.

740
00:47:31,016 --> 00:47:36,079
Rym: what my mouse says I wanted to bind attack one attack to attack three effect attack for the defaults on the mouse.

741
00:47:36,421 --> 00:47:40,419
Rym: Well, I know they weren't 100% anyway, but all I'm saying is that there are bugs where?

742
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:45,694
Rym: Random key combinations if you try to bind them would unbind other unrelated key combinations.

743
00:47:46,115 --> 00:47:47,158
Scott: It's still early access.

744
00:47:47,179 --> 00:47:47,540
Scott: send it in.

745
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:54,092
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure that they'll make a lot, you know, even though it is a very playable game That is not some you know, meet, you know.

746
00:47:54,172 --> 00:48:01,999
Scott: early access nothing game I'm sure over the course of the next year They are going to be patching and adding a lot of content to it.

747
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,880
Scott: There were a bunch of characters in it, but it's not as many as in risk of rain one.

748
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:13,980
Scott: I'm sure more will be added but I do worry that like I unlocked one character the way that second character worked is Their ability was basically homing shots.

749
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,185
Scott: So he didn't aim really.

750
00:48:15,466 --> 00:48:16,029
Scott: you just needed.

751
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:23,540
Scott: you just couldn't shoot unless an enemy was on screen And I think it would home in on whatever enemy was like closest to your you know center of looking.

752
00:48:23,861 --> 00:48:25,226
Scott: Yep, at least that's what I could.

753
00:48:25,707 --> 00:48:32,699
Scott: and then there's a special ability was jump in the air aim at the ground And then it would create a column of arrows hitting that spot on the ground.

754
00:48:33,482 --> 00:48:35,388
Scott: You know abilities like that and I want to.

755
00:48:35,429 --> 00:48:44,009
Rym: I like I'd be much more invested if I could try all these different characters without Having to grind and unlock them all Because the default guy pretty boring.

756
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:45,434
Scott: Yeah default guys way boring.

757
00:48:45,474 --> 00:48:47,499
Scott: All he does is running around to shoot Yep.

758
00:48:47,861 --> 00:49:06,020
Rym: But I guess the thing that worries me the most is that there's nothing interesting to find Anywhere in the levels except more of the goons the teleporter the boss or a huge variety of items Most of which have passive effects like some of your jobs do double damage your DPS.

759
00:49:06,321 --> 00:49:07,444
Rym: Yeah, I think that's.

760
00:49:07,464 --> 00:49:12,920
Scott: the thing is that you you know when I'm if I'm spending collecting money and grinding to collect stuff.

761
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,285
Rym: I wanted to get something awesome.

762
00:49:14,305 --> 00:49:15,088
Scott: I want to get stuff.

763
00:49:15,108 --> 00:49:17,859
Scott: That's interesting stuff, and you know it's like getting.

764
00:49:18,161 --> 00:49:20,480
Scott: It's like one of the things I kept getting was like this banner.

765
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:27,743
Scott: It's like whenever you level up a banner will spawn where on your location and that banner if you're within its radius will make you Stronger somehow.

766
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:28,426
Rym: that was pretty cool.

767
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:29,109
Rym: I kept getting things.

768
00:49:29,149 --> 00:49:31,860
Rym: It's just like you're slightly faster now right.

769
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:36,455
Rym: There were the wings that let you fly a little bit, and then they didn't work.

770
00:49:36,536 --> 00:49:39,086
Rym: after that they were like Double jump you can get.

771
00:49:39,106 --> 00:49:41,315
Rym: I wanted that more than I wanted life itself.

772
00:49:41,898 --> 00:49:44,987
Scott: I got it You know, but it's like yeah, you do.

773
00:49:45,047 --> 00:49:47,655
Scott: your first shot on an enemy does more damage.

774
00:49:47,675 --> 00:49:49,580
Scott: your shot your shots explode.

775
00:49:50,702 --> 00:49:53,315
Rym: You know most of the items come down to your attacks.

776
00:49:53,396 --> 00:49:54,300
Scott: make enemies bleed.

777
00:49:55,341 --> 00:49:57,367
Scott: The items never chance for crits here.

778
00:49:57,487 --> 00:49:58,450
Rym: items that were fun.

779
00:49:58,811 --> 00:50:03,026
Rym: flying little rock buddy that follows me around Rock buddy was a good one.

780
00:50:03,267 --> 00:50:05,780
Rym: Yeah items that were boring of drones.

781
00:50:06,123 --> 00:50:07,638
Scott: They just fly around and shoot for you.

782
00:50:08,081 --> 00:50:13,200
Rym: But most of the boring items they came down to my main complaints about combat in dungeons and dragons third edition.

783
00:50:13,702 --> 00:50:15,489
Rym: Everything just comes down to a flurry of blows.

784
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:18,059
Rym: do I do X attacks or do I do?

785
00:50:18,521 --> 00:50:21,670
Rym: X+2 attacks at a -2 like to hit on?

786
00:50:21,771 --> 00:50:21,911
Rym: all?

787
00:50:21,951 --> 00:50:24,820
Rym: the attacks like those are not interesting decisions.

788
00:50:25,221 --> 00:50:25,984
Scott: Yeah, I know it would be.

789
00:50:26,264 --> 00:50:37,800
Scott: I think you know if a similar game that is also a roguelike platformer is dead cells Which I played some recently, but I wasn't good enough to get very far in it because it is very difficult and skill based.

790
00:50:38,961 --> 00:50:45,611
Scott: But in that game there are lots and lots of weapons and equipment to unlock But all of them were unique and different.

791
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:56,514
Scott: there are freeze and freezing enemies Right stunning enemies moving enemies around Teleporting behind enemies all sorts of crazy different abilities that you know.

792
00:50:56,534 --> 00:51:06,214
Scott: you would basically play the game differently and In risk of rain choosing different characters lets you play the game differently But the weapons don't really at all right.

793
00:51:06,254 --> 00:51:07,038
Scott: the equipment doesn't.

794
00:51:07,279 --> 00:51:09,968
Scott: yeah I found myself in risk of rain one.

795
00:51:10,009 --> 00:51:13,260
Scott: it still had the same problem mostly but a risk of rain one.

796
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:17,679
Scott: I definitely wanted to equip more and risk of rain - it was just rush the teleporter.

797
00:51:18,122 --> 00:51:23,418
Scott: Yeah, right those didn't feel like there was much incentive to get money and get stuff.

798
00:51:24,383 --> 00:51:31,920
Rym: So I just I don't know if the game in one year's time Would get to the point to where I would play it a lot.

799
00:51:32,201 --> 00:51:34,348
Scott: Yeah, the aesthetic and the.

800
00:51:34,489 --> 00:51:34,970
Scott: you know the.

801
00:51:35,131 --> 00:51:42,016
Scott: the story and atmosphere is kind of cool Yeah, but it's you know you see it all right away like the world.

802
00:51:42,036 --> 00:51:44,748
Scott: the difference is like there Isn't like some terrible secret of space.

803
00:51:44,808 --> 00:51:45,511
Scott: I'm waiting to see.

804
00:51:45,572 --> 00:51:47,340
Scott: I feel like you know you two three levels in.

805
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:47,942
Scott: I've seen it all.

806
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:48,243
Rym: yep.

807
00:51:48,283 --> 00:51:52,700
Rym: meanwhile like slay the spire you get a lot of environmental storytelling when you work through that game.

808
00:51:52,881 --> 00:51:56,416
Scott: Oh, yeah, lots, so the world is not rich.

809
00:51:56,476 --> 00:51:57,260
Scott: It's it's sparse.

810
00:51:58,003 --> 00:52:00,612
Rym: It's the difference between fallout 3 and breath of the wild.

811
00:52:00,672 --> 00:52:08,525
Scott: right it's like a big sparse empty space And the only thing that fills it is just a fuck ton of enemies that spawn More more and more rapidly

812
00:52:08,605 --> 00:52:13,300
Rym: and a bunch of art assets that in no way interact with you and do nothing other than

813
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,615
Scott: Exploding pots you can shoot.

814
00:52:15,655 --> 00:52:21,447
Scott: They're just Exploding barrels like in Doom.

815
00:52:21,467 --> 00:52:22,271
Scott: they don't you know.

816
00:52:22,332 --> 00:52:23,960
Scott: as far as I can tell they weren't even useful.

817
00:52:24,342 --> 00:52:28,740
Rym: I couldn't even like get an enemy to be by one because they're like up high on these platforms.

818
00:52:28,861 --> 00:52:32,200
Rym: They weren't on the ground which look like they'd be cool, but I went up there, and there was nothing up there.

819
00:52:32,321 --> 00:52:33,356
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

820
00:52:34,101 --> 00:52:39,577
Rym: I guess if I were you do not buy risk of rain - at least not for the current price of $20.

821
00:52:39,577 --> 00:52:41,707
Scott: yes Right maybe this is.

822
00:52:41,888 --> 00:52:44,220
Scott: this is the kind of game wait until it comes out for real.

823
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,928
Scott: Maybe when it comes out in a year.

824
00:52:45,948 --> 00:52:47,536
Scott: They will have added so much shit to it.

825
00:52:47,556 --> 00:52:48,380
Scott: That'll be incredible.

826
00:52:49,681 --> 00:52:51,507
Scott: Or be you'll wait a year.

827
00:52:51,527 --> 00:52:55,080
Scott: It'll still be you know somewhat better than its current state.

828
00:52:55,281 --> 00:52:57,892
Scott: But then when there's like a steam sale, and it's like $1 $5.00.

829
00:52:57,892 --> 00:52:59,720
Scott: It'll be like oh, yeah, definitely fine.

830
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,719
Rym: Oh, yep, because the fact that you can just like the co-op just works like they got all right.

831
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:04,763
Scott: Risk of rain.

832
00:53:04,923 --> 00:53:10,601
Scott: one you have to do some bullshit with your IP addresses risk of rain - is just invite steam friend play totally Works.

833
00:53:11,043 --> 00:53:18,207
Scott: so the co-op aspect really makes this work a lot more a lot better a lot more fun Than if you just play it by yourself.

834
00:53:18,368 --> 00:53:21,520
Scott: Yeah, especially if you mix up your characters you work together a little bit.

835
00:53:21,881 --> 00:53:23,592
Scott: It needs more like with four people.

836
00:53:23,612 --> 00:53:27,552
Rym: you can find the teleporter faster Yeah, but like all the technical aspects like they got everything right.

837
00:53:27,652 --> 00:53:29,260
Rym: usually indie games mess that stuff up.

838
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:38,420
Rym: Yeah, this game got everything right and has a lot of really fascinating concepts together But they haven't really turned it into a satisfying repeatedly playable game yet.

839
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:44,179
Scott: I think it's definitely for the kind of player who is interested in mastery and going deep and getting good at it.

840
00:53:44,401 --> 00:53:47,744
Scott: Yeah, right that kind of person is gonna Enjoy it a lot more.

841
00:53:47,764 --> 00:53:58,880
Scott: who doesn't mind doing some you know same things over and over again, but because it's a brainy So who's seeking novelty is not gonna have as much fun, but the fighting is so grindy that I hate to say it.

842
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:02,277
Rym: I feel like you're but you would be better off playing borderlands 1.

843
00:54:02,277 --> 00:54:03,905
Scott: yeah I feel like this game.

844
00:54:03,925 --> 00:54:06,837
Scott: would you be more fun if they simply did this one thing which is?

845
00:54:08,163 --> 00:54:10,812
Scott: Get rid of enemy health and end damage on weapons.

846
00:54:11,294 --> 00:54:17,094
Scott: right just have All enemies die in like one hit, but have it.

847
00:54:17,315 --> 00:54:18,800
Scott: you know the beginning enemies.

848
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:22,294
Scott: You just shoot him and they die, but then as the enemies get harder.

849
00:54:22,434 --> 00:54:28,970
Scott: It's like shoot him at the right time Shoot him in the right spot Disable their shield and then shoot him.

850
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:30,437
Scott: get behind him and shoot him.

851
00:54:30,457 --> 00:54:31,805
Rym: maybe bosses He got a good.

852
00:54:31,926 --> 00:54:33,920
Scott: only shoot that you look only hurt these guys with fire.

853
00:54:34,042 --> 00:54:37,107
Scott: You can only hurt these guys When they're in the air.

854
00:54:37,127 --> 00:54:39,540
Scott: you can only hurt these guys during this time of their cycle.

855
00:54:40,221 --> 00:54:43,280
Scott: Right all that that would make the game way more interesting.

856
00:54:43,722 --> 00:54:50,799
Scott: You know shoot more like gauntlet where there's like a ton of guys and you're hosing down Right and they all die in one hit, but they just you know a mess of guys.

857
00:54:51,281 --> 00:54:52,607
Rym: Yep, big money.

858
00:54:52,808 --> 00:54:55,640
Scott: more like fries more like a shmup where it's like okay?

859
00:54:55,820 --> 00:55:02,840
Scott: I keep getting different weapons But all the weapons are interesting and crazy in different ways a spread shot the big laser That's only in the middle right that kind of stuff.

860
00:55:03,002 --> 00:55:08,838
Scott: Yeah, so Hold off on buying the game, and I'm sure the shmup roguelikes right.

861
00:55:08,858 --> 00:55:10,345
Scott: let's yeah Let's go find one and play that.

862
00:55:10,747 --> 00:55:15,533
Rym: but I'm gonna revisit this game once it comes out for real And it's definitely a game for revisiting.

863
00:55:15,553 --> 00:55:16,560
Rym: I'm gonna keep an eye on it.

864
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:19,430
Rym: It's not ruled out, but don't spend 20 bucks on it today.

865
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,337
Scott: No unless you'd have to make a podcast.

866

Scott: Mira, Mira on the wall, who's the greatest hobbit of them all?

875

Scott: Bilbo, Bilbo Baggins is only three feet tall But my name is Gimli, I'm a fucking dwarf, I be slaying motherfuckers from the south to the north.

876
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:54,260
Scott: That ain't Markwood, I'm dropping with my battle axe, I'm on an orc stampede like Shadowfax.

877
00:57:54,441 --> 00:57:59,440
Scott: Now all you bobbins and bulls is race girdles and proud feet, I'm the skinny hobbit with all the fat beats.

880
00:58:09,602 --> 00:58:14,060
Scott: Beam on the scene, all the elf girls scream like a tree, that's me, I like to keep it green.

881
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:19,059
Rym: It's the chronic pipe weed that I'm smoking, and when I get high I spin tails like hokies.

882
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,735
Scott: Well, I'm a hobbit warrior, short and stout, I got the fucking beats.

883
00:58:22,775 --> 00:58:23,920
Rym: that'll turn you out.

884
00:58:24,462 --> 00:58:28,659
