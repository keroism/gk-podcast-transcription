1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,669
Scott: It's Thursday November 9th.

2
00:00:12,251 --> 00:00:15,952
Scott: I'm Scott and I'm Rym and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:15,992 --> 00:00:18,818
Scott: we discuss bathing and showering.

4
00:00:20,323 --> 00:00:21,358
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,862 --> 00:00:26,833
Rym: It took me not one not two, but three hours to get to work today.

6
00:00:26,853 --> 00:00:28,097
Rym: Oh, man.

7
00:00:28,117 --> 00:00:31,547
Scott: I got to work Today faster than ever before.

8
00:00:31,787 --> 00:00:35,879
Rym: yeah, well because you don't really go into a heavily populated area.

9
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:40,060
Scott: now I go from heavily populated area to a less populated area.

10
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:50,156
Rym: See I would have been okay because the only issue really was that the sawmill River flooded after the torrential downpour the other day Which meant that the primary road I take to work was also flooded.

11
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:53,769
Rym: of course They closed the road without telling anyone there weren't signs or anything.

12
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:57,259
Rym: the road was just closed and no one knew what to do.

13
00:00:58,082 --> 00:00:59,608
Scott: What about the workers in the sawmill?

14
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:02,499
Scott: did they have any trouble with their logs getting cut up for?

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,263
Scott: Soggy or anything?

16
00:01:04,283 --> 00:01:04,584
Rym: you know?

17
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:07,717
Rym: the sawmill River is like four feet wide right now.

18
00:01:07,757 --> 00:01:12,633
Scott: I'm being silly Actually being a sawmill there when there used to be you know 200 years ago.

19
00:01:12,653 --> 00:01:20,900
Rym: Yeah, yeah That that was part of my joke though The thing is I would it would have been okay that only added about an hour to my commute.

20
00:01:21,262 --> 00:01:24,540
Rym: So where did this magical mystical third hour come from idiots?

21
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:33,719
Rym: Completely unrelated to that on the way to work some jackass Just hit someone else and spun out and blocked the entire taconic Parkway for an hour.

22
00:01:34,584 --> 00:01:36,254
Scott: Oh, I never would have thought that would happen.

23
00:01:36,455 --> 00:01:44,180
Rym: and then later today I was driving around for work going to different places, and I saw three completely independent major accidents.

24
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:51,860
Rym: Yeah, there seems to have been a sudden increase at least anecdotally from my perspective in major accidents on roads on which I travel.

25
00:01:52,502 --> 00:01:53,745
Scott: Yeah, just this was it.

26
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:58,759
Rym: this more saw a nun yelling at a guy after she caught him off and got hit.

27
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,720
Scott: Yeah, I think there was an accident on 52 this morning right in front of the Sunoco station, huh?

28
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:08,428
Scott: It was either this morning or yesterday morning.

29
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:10,054
Scott: It's morning, so I don't really remember too.

30
00:02:10,074 --> 00:02:11,520
Rym: Well really you really don't know.

31
00:02:12,063 --> 00:02:13,351
Scott: I don't know if it's today or yesterday.

32
00:02:13,593 --> 00:02:14,720
Rym: What did you eat for dinner yesterday?

33
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:21,916
Rym: I Rest my chicken and potato all right.

34
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:26,285
Rym: what we have the night before Pasta with sauce on.

35
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:31,142
Rym: uh-huh you sure that wasn't the day before that and then we just crowned that other night I'm sure.

36
00:02:31,162 --> 00:02:32,226
Rym: are you sure?

37
00:02:32,246 --> 00:02:35,958
Rym: I'm pretty sure Captain Alzheimer of the USS something know.

38
00:02:35,978 --> 00:02:39,393
Scott: if I had Alzheimer I'd be like what am I doing there?

39
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:40,659
Scott: What's his microphone here for?

40
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:43,043
Scott: What's this again?

41
00:02:43,505 --> 00:02:44,208
Scott: talking stick?

42
00:02:44,649 --> 00:02:47,720
Rym: yeah, but anyway the interesting part about the whole what's your name, Sonny?

43
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:55,622
Rym: was that I was coming in and the road was closed directly in front of me, and there was a traffic light and You could.

44
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:59,539
Rym: basically the only thing you can do here is turn left, so the light is red.

45
00:03:00,241 --> 00:03:03,530
Rym: I cannot legally turn left even though there's no oncoming traffic.

46
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:08,218
Rym: the lady behind me starts getting super pissed off that I'm not turning left now.

47
00:03:08,803 --> 00:03:11,100
Rym: Normally, I probably would have just run the red light.

48
00:03:11,421 --> 00:03:18,650
Rym: But if you look where I could have turned left onto the other road Traffic had filled that road all the way up to where I was.

49
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,680
Rym: I would have run the red light and driven five feet.

50
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:35,331
Rym: Not only was this lady honking continuously, but she started whining and yelling at me through her window come on Come on, just go just go come on come on come on come on Have not gone until she stopped?

51
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:36,760
Rym: yeah, I did better than that.

52
00:03:37,122 --> 00:03:39,736
Rym: I got out of my car turn around and took a picture of her.

53
00:03:39,756 --> 00:03:55,816
Rym: yeah she got super pissed then and she ran around me and cut me off and made that left turn and Sat there blocking the road, and she couldn't get in And then I just pulled up behind her when the light turned green and followed her for the next.

54
00:03:55,876 --> 00:03:57,363
Rym: you know ten miles of this Trip.

55
00:03:57,848 --> 00:04:04,760
Rym: just kind of you know Sinking in the fact that she didn't really get anywhere other than frustrated by trying to make that red light.

56
00:04:05,342 --> 00:04:09,260
Rym: Why are people so to paraphrase Penn Jillette goddamn stupid?

57
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:12,806
Scott: Because they didn't get an education.

58
00:04:12,826 --> 00:04:13,368
Scott: I don't know.

59
00:04:13,448 --> 00:04:15,033
Rym: no she's obviously well-dressed.

60
00:04:15,153 --> 00:04:17,300
Rym: She was on her way to a white-collar job somewhere.

61
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:19,325
Rym: She probably makes within $20,000 of what I make.

62
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,704
Scott: Probably I don't know.

63
00:04:23,824 --> 00:04:25,450
Rym: she was driving a really nice car.

64
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,433
Rym: well not a nice car.

65
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,340
Rym: She was driving a pseudo nice car.

66
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:29,158
Rym: She had some Lexus.

67
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:36,060
Scott: Yeah, car that's you know bit high on the prestige for people who care about that sort of thing.

68
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,420
Scott: But everyone else goes wow look at that guy just trying to look good, but doesn't actually know shit about cars.

69
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:47,380
Rym: I don't think I've ever known anyone that I was friends with who owned a Lexus on purpose.

70
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:49,825
Scott: Yeah, I can't think.

71
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:59,580
Scott: is there anyone who owns a Lexus because they think it's a good car and a good value for the money And they don't buy it because it's some sort of prestige icon sort of thing?

72
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:04,581
Rym: See it's kind of like we were talking about the Escalade or the h2 Hummer the other day And how.

73
00:05:04,662 --> 00:05:11,500
Rym: basically these sorts of cars are really just the equivalent of the old yellow badges from Nazi Germany only instead of Jewish.

74
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:12,583
Rym: They mean stupid.

75
00:05:12,925 --> 00:05:14,028
Scott: Yeah, basically.

76
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:22,817
Scott: Hey someone made a purchasing decision because they're trying to Impress other idiots who care about consumerism and whatever.

77
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:23,660
Scott: I don't know.

78
00:05:24,963 --> 00:05:25,711
Scott: It's sort of like.

79
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:26,540
Scott: you know it's sort of weird.

80
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,538
Scott: I I could really see this contrast in my childhood because I was from New York like originally.

81
00:05:32,558 --> 00:05:35,530
Scott: well you Don't say you're from that yard.

82
00:05:35,731 --> 00:05:37,820
Scott: I lived there for like a whole year, but then I was in Connecticut.

83
00:05:39,402 --> 00:05:43,339
Rym: What you can't remember a single thing from that year can you I?

84
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,684
Scott: Remember a couple things.

85
00:05:46,085 --> 00:05:46,406
Rym: what?

86
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:49,557
Rym: what do you remember from the ages of zero to one?

87
00:05:51,123 --> 00:05:54,400
Scott: When my mom would bring me to that little park next to the the apartment there

88
00:05:54,761 --> 00:06:03,355
Rym: Are you sure you remember that is you're not just making it up because I remember distinctly being bitten by a dog But my parents swear that it didn't happen when I was really really young.

89
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,499
Scott: I'm not saying it happened I'm just saying that's what I remember.

90
00:06:05,821 --> 00:06:08,893
Scott: I remember a lot of things and my mom says I went to the park.

91
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:17,480
Scott: so but the point is is I had a bunch of relatives in New York So I was hanging out with New York people in Connecticut people all Jews all had a bunch of money, right?

92
00:06:18,122 --> 00:06:23,020
Scott: But the New York Jews like for their bar and bought mitzvahs they would put on the big show.

93
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:26,878
Scott: You know they would all be all showy with lots of jewelry and lots of fans.

94
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:33,060
Scott: You know Yeah, jewelry all the all the Jewish ladies in New York were like loaded with jewelry.

95
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,648
Scott: You know everyone really cared about.

96
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:35,391
Scott: you know this sort of.

97
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:39,087
Scott: I have expensive things So I'm better than you all showing off.

98
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:40,692
Scott: and all the Connecticut people.

99
00:06:40,752 --> 00:06:45,832
Scott: while they had just as much money Usually even more they weren't so showy.

100
00:06:46,294 --> 00:06:48,560
Scott: you know they were much more utilitarian.

101
00:06:49,621 --> 00:06:53,033
Rym: I've pretty much lived my life exactly the same way regardless of how much money.

102
00:06:53,073 --> 00:06:53,455
Rym: I've had.

103
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:54,780
Scott: yeah pretty much.

104
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:59,760
Rym: I mean the only difference is on the bottom end of the scale of rims economic well-being.

105
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:02,889
Rym: It got to the point where if it weren't for the charity of some friends.

106
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:07,747
Rym: I probably would have starved to death, but I Don't think you would have died.

107
00:07:07,808 --> 00:07:07,929
Rym: No.

108
00:07:07,989 --> 00:07:09,619
Rym: I wouldn't have died, but it would have sucked.

109
00:07:10,242 --> 00:07:13,257
Scott: Yeah, you might have to eat bad gruel from the homeless shelter.

110
00:07:13,297 --> 00:07:13,980
Rym: It sucked anyway.

111
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:29,938
Rym: I mean there were many days in the pretty much right before I went on co-op and made you know like $20,000 which was a lot when you're in college, and you don't have any expenses other than ramen Ramen.

112
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:35,499
Rym: and I remember there were days where I'd wake up and I'd eat anything I could find in the house Which usually wasn't much?

113
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:41,358
Rym: We'd have like one egg so I'd cook it and maybe a moldy English muffin that I toast real good.

114
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:47,899
Rym: and then he Or actually we had a freezer full of ice cream mochi which lasted about one morning.

115
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:54,955
Rym: I'd be on campus I'd be hungry, and I couldn't afford to buy any food so I'd be hungry until night.

116
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,420
Rym: then I'd come home and eat some ramen Alright, so what's the news say?

117
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,170
Rym: I only get into the news cuz my news is totally uninteresting.

118
00:08:01,391 --> 00:08:03,680
Scott: whatever we got to do a show alright.

119
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,294
Rym: so the thing I actually want to talk about and my news are kind of related.

120
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:18,491
Rym: they involve the Pagan holiday that Christianity co-opted and turned into the birth of their Savior Jesus Mm-hmm you know aka Christmas yep the yule festival and all that yep.

121
00:08:18,852 --> 00:08:24,440
Rym: now for a long time bit by bit stores have been not Saying things like Merry Christmas.

122
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:29,676
Rym: They've been replacing everything with holiday sales and holiday stuff in order to avoid offending people.

123
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:42,754
Rym: and now Walmart The stalwart defenders of everything wonderful that they are decided that they are going to stand up against this tide of Something by doing the opposite thing and they're gonna start saying Merry Christmas again.

124
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:43,436
Rym: God damn it.

125
00:08:44,018 --> 00:08:44,500
Scott: You know what?

126
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:47,000
Scott: I don't like either one.

127
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,935
Scott: I don't like Christmas because I don't like religion, and I don't like political correctness.

128
00:08:52,317 --> 00:08:54,906
Scott: so no matter what decision They make I hate them either way.

129
00:08:54,926 --> 00:08:56,834
Scott: I basically hate everyone.

130
00:08:56,854 --> 00:08:58,480
Rym: I don't celebrate Christmas.

131
00:08:58,661 --> 00:08:59,383
Rym: I haven't pretty much.

132
00:08:59,423 --> 00:09:03,880
Scott: You know what I would support them if they just didn't do anything for the holidays.

133
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:12,440
Scott: They just ran their store as normal didn't change their store into Christmas consumer Hell you know around the beginning of November just kept doing business.

134
00:09:13,203 --> 00:09:14,247
Rym: Try the middle of October.

135
00:09:14,328 --> 00:09:17,400
Scott: I know I know, but they just ignored the holidays completely.

136
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:20,120
Scott: Then that is the only way to avoid my ire.

137
00:09:20,862 --> 00:09:23,750
Rym: Well, it's really not easy to avoid your iris.

138
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,071
Rym: God.

139
00:09:24,111 --> 00:09:24,412
Rym: No.

140
00:09:24,493 --> 00:09:25,114
Scott: No it is not.

141
00:09:25,174 --> 00:09:29,385
Scott: my iris is a Giant blanket covering the entire world.

142
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:30,668
Rym: you can't avoid ten hours.

143
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:36,240
Rym: Oh, no you can't Hey Scott, but where were you originally born?

144
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,220
Scott: Mount Ireland?

145
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:40,995
Scott: No, Ireland.

146
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,798
Rym: Okay, anyway, but you see I don't care.

147
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:49,456
Rym: either way I call it Christmas because I grew up in a family that celebrated Christmas in a 100% secular way.

148
00:09:51,022 --> 00:09:55,160
Rym: I also went to a Catholic school when I was very young where we'd have to go to church occasionally and pretend we believed in.

149
00:09:56,023 --> 00:10:01,386
Rym: But Christmas was really more just the time when the whole family got together And I always viewed it as such.

150
00:10:01,427 --> 00:10:05,970
Rym: and while I've never celebrated it as a religious holiday Until I went to college.

151
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,919
Rym: I always celebrated it as a family holiday.

152
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:12,535
Rym: Then I went to college and I couldn't exactly travel around so often anymore to my family.

153
00:10:12,816 --> 00:10:30,879
Rym: half my family moved to Arizona And then I moved to downstate, New York and last year my Christmas celebrations consisted of talking about our podcast that we were starting Dealing with the fact that Scott set off the burglar alarm on our house And we couldn't turn it off during which time it called 9-1-1 and the police came.

154
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,906
Scott: now I think the next-door neighbor lady called 9-1-1.

155
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:36,800
Rym: Yeah, it also called in I'm pretty sure cuz I cut a phone line.

156
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,836
Rym: Yeah, who knows I cut a phone line and a bunch of power cables to it all right.

157
00:10:41,378 --> 00:10:43,627
Scott: Yeah I think we ate at a Chinese buffet.

158
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:45,715
Rym: Yeah, we ate at a mediocre Chinese buffet.

159
00:10:45,755 --> 00:10:47,080
Rym: That was the extent of my Christmas.

160
00:10:47,404 --> 00:11:02,767
Rym: Yeah, that's pretty typical The previous Christmas where I decided I was gonna fly home to Detroit and see my grandparents and my dad my brother and then Every single flight I was on was canceled for reasons ranging from mechanical failure to workers striking to a blizzard.

161
00:11:03,048 --> 00:11:11,660
Rym: and I end up spending an entire day all of Christmas at Newark Airport drinking free liquor getting drunk and being bored playing my DS.

162
00:11:12,502 --> 00:11:14,380
Rym: Awesome that was an awesome Christmas.

163
00:11:14,662 --> 00:11:22,540
Rym: Then I got sick, and I went home And I played more DS while I was laying in bed sick in my studio apartment all alone in Fishkill.

164
00:11:26,082 --> 00:11:28,208
Rym: That was the best Christmas ever then.

165
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:29,733
Rym: the dinosaurs can't be worse.

166
00:11:29,954 --> 00:11:31,177
Scott: I spent a Christmas once.

167
00:11:31,238 --> 00:11:32,060
Scott: I was in Rochester.

168
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,344
Scott: I didn't leave Rochester.

169
00:11:33,364 --> 00:11:34,789
Scott: I was living in colony.

170
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:35,973
Scott: No one was there.

171
00:11:35,993 --> 00:11:38,140
Scott: I think I went to China Gate alone.

172
00:11:38,401 --> 00:11:41,880
Rym: I remember that I felt bad for you cuz I went out to do something on Christmas.

173
00:11:41,961 --> 00:11:43,572
Rym: Then I came back and you were still there.

174
00:11:43,592 --> 00:11:48,170
Rym: yeah Hey, was that the year we went to Niagara Falls for New Year's?

175
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:50,497
Scott: it might have been whatever.

176
00:11:50,758 --> 00:11:51,360
Scott: it doesn't matter.

177
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:57,565
Scott: It's not worse than saying in an airport all day or being sick in a in a box all day Yeah, I was in colony.

178
00:11:57,605 --> 00:12:00,635
Scott: I had an OC 3. no one else was clogging up the network.

179
00:12:00,696 --> 00:12:01,478
Scott: I had good food.

180
00:12:01,498 --> 00:12:02,000
Scott: I had money.

181
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,593
Scott: I was warm.

182
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:04,505
Scott: It was good times.

183
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:15,079
Rym: the best part was when they canceled my last flight, and I went up to the people I'm like all right fuckers, and I pretty much said it exactly those terms I want my money back.

184
00:12:15,381 --> 00:12:18,820
Rym: They gave me my money back, and then I said I want a ride home.

185
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:20,539
Rym: And they said we're not giving you a ride home.

186
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:26,740
Rym: And then I said you drove my ass from Stewart Airport an hour and a half to here.

187
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,410
Rym: I don't have a car here.

188
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:29,679
Rym: What do you want me to do?

189
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:31,610
Rym: Pay me a cab.

190
00:12:32,053 --> 00:12:32,800
Rym: and they got pissed.

191
00:12:33,181 --> 00:12:41,899
Rym: But then they gave me an unlimited taxi voucher and I got in a cab at Newark And I said take me to Stewart Airport, and he said what?

192
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:46,259
Rym: And I handed him this thing and it was like a hundred and forty bucks by the end.

193
00:12:47,722 --> 00:12:51,360
Scott: I didn't care and the guy like the taxi guy actually drove that far.

194
00:12:51,601 --> 00:12:55,997
Rym: Yeah, not only did he drive that far, but I talked to him the whole time about how shitty my Christmas was man.

195
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,843
Scott: His Christmas even shitter.

196
00:12:57,863 --> 00:12:58,465
Scott: He's like man.

197
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:03,400
Scott: I spent my Christmas in this fucking cab driving really really far away talking to this loser.

198
00:13:04,924 --> 00:13:08,825
Scott: All right my news Stefan Erickson.

199
00:13:08,845 --> 00:13:14,667
Scott: oh yeah, he's gonna join the ranks of Sony and What's his name Jack Thompson.

200
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:16,595
Scott: in being in the news often?

201
00:13:16,715 --> 00:13:17,860
Rym: Yeah except Jack Thompson?

202
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:18,522
Rym: I don't know.

203
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:20,068
Rym: They're different levels of absurdity.

204
00:13:20,128 --> 00:13:22,779
Rym: this guy is absurd for awesome reasons.

205
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:28,753
Scott: Well, not really, but yeah this I think this guy actually give me the last time He's in the news because this this is the king.

206
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:32,214
Rym: no no no I guarantee He'll be in news one more time, and that'll be when he gets shaved.

207
00:13:32,496 --> 00:13:36,581
Scott: it could be All Right.

208
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:47,540
Scott: this is like the conclusion to this epic tale, so there's a guy named Stefan Erickson, and he's a bad Corrupt mafia dude from Sweden all right.

209
00:13:48,082 --> 00:13:59,040
Scott: And he decides to pull this big scam and make a video game system called the Gizmondo Which actually had a few interesting ideas and that it was a portable thing with the GPS and there'd be some GPS games.

210
00:13:59,461 --> 00:14:00,203
Scott: But no it was just.

211
00:14:00,665 --> 00:14:01,788
Scott: everyone knew was gonna fail.

212
00:14:01,828 --> 00:14:02,591
Scott: It was ridiculed.

213
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:03,333
Scott: It was crappy.

214
00:14:03,914 --> 00:14:05,700
Scott: No one had any expectations for it.

215
00:14:05,881 --> 00:14:09,200
Rym: It was kind of like the that other fake console that didn't come.

216
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:13,846
Scott: It's basically a big scam where he ripped off a bunch of investors Or you know the ps3 right.

217
00:14:14,248 --> 00:14:17,620
Scott: so this is the guy who he basically ran away to the u.s.

218
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:28,112
Scott: He brought with him a Mercedes like Frickin McLaren or whatever our race car yeah, and an Enzo Ferrari of which there are only 400.

219
00:14:28,112 --> 00:14:29,182
Rym: well now there's 399.

220
00:14:29,182 --> 00:14:32,356
Scott: I think it's actually 398. someone else crashed one.

221
00:14:32,557 --> 00:14:34,687
Scott: Oh good job yeah, and those are like.

222
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,238
Scott: that's like a million dollar ultra-rare amazing car.

223
00:14:37,258 --> 00:14:41,713
Scott: and He got drunk, and he crashed the Enzo.

224
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:43,600
Scott: and then weird shit happened.

225
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,324
Rym: We like that.

226
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,940
Rym: they started saying that someone else was yeah.

227
00:14:47,161 --> 00:14:51,940
Scott: He was like said someone else named Dietrich was driving, but Dietrich was never found.

228
00:14:52,543 --> 00:15:05,660
Scott: yeah, and like these guys were posing as Homeland security officers and all kinds of weird shit Someone tried to steal some of the wreckage of the car.

229
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:13,779
Scott: Yeah, he had a gun that was property of some Sheriff's like assistant like a deputy sheriff in his house.

230
00:15:14,742 --> 00:15:20,879
Scott: It was just all fucked up, but now they got him and he pleaded no contest to a bunch of charges.

231
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:23,372
Rym: now I like the idea of pleading no contest.

232
00:15:23,392 --> 00:15:29,593
Rym: you're basically saying I May or may not have done whatever you're accusing me of but I'm not gonna fight it.

233
00:15:29,854 --> 00:15:32,000
Rym: that doesn't mean I'm saying I did it.

234
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,270
Rym: It just means I'm gonna accept whatever punishment.

235
00:15:34,571 --> 00:15:36,138
Rym: I'm not actually admitting to anything.

236
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:37,968
Scott: yeah Yeah, that's fine.

237
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:40,160
Rym: No one cool ever pleads no contest.

238
00:15:43,306 --> 00:15:44,679
Scott: So you play no contest.

239
00:15:45,781 --> 00:15:59,200
Scott: And he's going to jail for I think three years, and he's paying a lot of money and fines and after the three years He's gonna be deported back to Sweden where they'll probably put him in jail again because he's an evil mafia, dude awesome.

240
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,376
Scott: Yeah, he's a drunken bad guy, and he ruined a perfectly awesome car.

241
00:16:04,456 --> 00:16:05,259
Scott: I could have had that car.

242
00:16:05,762 --> 00:16:06,473
Rym: No, you couldn't have.

243
00:16:06,818 --> 00:16:07,222
Scott: yeah I could have.

244
00:16:07,545 --> 00:16:08,999
Rym: I think you would have trouble with that car.

245
00:16:09,361 --> 00:16:12,239
Rym: Well that that car would have spelled bad news all around for you.

246
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,046
Scott: What kind of bad news would have dispelled?

247
00:16:14,246 --> 00:16:18,160
Rym: you would have died within five minutes of turning on that car?

248
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,029
Scott: I would have just brought it over to Watkins Glen.

249
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:20,894
Scott: I wouldn't have died over there.

250
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:23,610
Rym: Yeah, you would have Right into the wall.

251
00:16:23,911 --> 00:16:25,400
Scott: there is a. I guess there is a wall.

252
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,585
Scott: I wouldn't go into it.

253
00:16:26,806 --> 00:16:32,150
Rym: if you go in any direction long enough you hit a wall or an ocean Probably a wall dude.

254
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,820
Scott: I should have had it totally modded.

255
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:38,457
Scott: So it'd be one of those car boats like the Enzo car boat should have totally had it modded.

256
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:39,099
Rym: you didn't have it.

257
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:44,787
Rym: That's that's quite a. it's like if I'd had that Enzo I would have totally I should have.

258
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:47,716
Rym: I did have that Enzo, and I should have done blah to it.

259
00:16:47,816 --> 00:16:50,610
Rym: That's right, okay I said enough news for you.

260
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:53,418
Scott: I think it's gonna cover the news again.

261
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:01,879
Rym: things of the day.

262
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:04,105
Scott: How many things of the day?

263
00:17:04,185 --> 00:17:06,651
Scott: two two two not three?

264
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:07,492
Rym: No?

265
00:17:07,573 --> 00:17:08,756
Rym: We don't have a third person here.

266
00:17:08,935 --> 00:17:12,474
Scott: Oh, no I Guess that guy over there was just faking it.

267
00:17:12,817 --> 00:17:12,999
Rym: what?

268
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,262
Scott: Right things of the day.

269
00:17:15,604 --> 00:17:18,813
Rym: There's no guy over there, or is there?

270
00:17:19,515 --> 00:17:21,060
Rym: no no there isn't are you sure?

271
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,459
Rym: There's just a one-up mushroom.

272
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:28,098
Scott: That's what it is the mushroom, okay?

273
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:36,052
Scott: All right I'm just trying to be randomly crazy, but it didn't work.

274
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:37,358
Rym: No it didn't work at all.

275
00:17:37,438 --> 00:17:40,056
Rym: you suck That was that was pretty piss-poor.

276
00:17:40,116 --> 00:17:40,620
Rym: I'm sorry.

277
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,120
Rym: I'm really sorry because it could have been funny.

278
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,112
Rym: I don't know maybe if I'd done something different like pretended.

279
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,638
Rym: There was a guy in the room with me.

280
00:17:48,741 --> 00:17:49,724
Scott: No, it's not necessary.

281
00:17:49,865 --> 00:17:50,066
Rym: Well.

282
00:17:50,106 --> 00:17:56,888
Rym: I guess there is a guy in the room cuz you know we've got we've got teller from Penn and Yeah, yeah, actually isn't funny.

283
00:17:57,389 --> 00:18:09,832
Rym: actually I thought the joke would have been funny except that I don't listen to the radio and Apparently according to Penn Gillette every radio show he's ever been on ever Has thought it'd be clever to act like teller was there too even when he wasn't.

284
00:18:09,852 --> 00:18:14,857
Rym: yeah like every guy ever thought They were being clever and none of them were.

285
00:18:15,139 --> 00:18:16,746
Rym: well No, I guess they all were independently.

286
00:18:16,786 --> 00:18:20,616
Rym: they all discovered it independently kind of like how two people discover the light bulb at the same time.

287
00:18:21,681 --> 00:18:23,248
Scott: All right, what's your thing of the day?

288
00:18:23,308 --> 00:18:26,040
Rym: my thing of the day is this flash game called?

289
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,727
Rym: Orbit.

290
00:18:27,748 --> 00:18:28,151
Scott: I played it.

291
00:18:28,252 --> 00:18:28,575
Scott: It's good.

292
00:18:28,737 --> 00:18:29,020
Rym: It's fun.

293
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:32,650
Rym: I played it for about five minutes And I could have played it longer if I had.

294
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,800
Rym: you know no life and nothing better to do.

295
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,640
Rym: It's one of those games that you just play a little bit.

296
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,377
Rym: It's not as fun as that drag sand around and then put oil in it and set it on fire.

297
00:18:41,397 --> 00:18:42,240
Scott: That's not really a game.

298
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,299
Scott: That's more of a sandbox.

299
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,304
Rym: Sandboxes are games.

300
00:18:45,465 --> 00:18:46,489
Rym: games are sandboxes.

301
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:48,638
Scott: I guess not really kind of.

302
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:49,000
Rym: yeah.

303
00:18:49,523 --> 00:18:52,258
Rym: I made races between two trees to see which one would flourish.

304
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:53,122
Scott: well That's that's.

305
00:18:53,163 --> 00:18:54,970
Scott: you created a game within the sandbox.

306
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,139
Rym: Yeah, the game was making a game.

307
00:18:59,123 --> 00:19:01,577
Scott: I guess it doesn't have to be yeah.

308
00:19:01,758 --> 00:19:03,828
Rym: anyway It's a little fun game.

309
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:12,822
Rym: where you take a comet you give it a little bit of velocity And there's a bunch of planets on the board and your goal is to make it orbit or generally avoid these planets for as long As possible.

310
00:19:12,862 --> 00:19:17,335
Rym: the planets thereby well during which are exerting gravity upon your little comet.

311
00:19:17,937 --> 00:19:20,747
Scott: a lot of it is trial and error You know try a vector doesn't work.

312
00:19:20,848 --> 00:19:22,093
Scott: try a vector doesn't work.

313
00:19:22,173 --> 00:19:22,736
Scott: try a vector.

314
00:19:22,776 --> 00:19:30,911
Rym: we it worked though I thought I was all smooth because the first time I played it the first three levels one I got the bonus skip a level bonus because I was so awesome.

315
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:35,476
Rym: kind of by luck mostly by luck but to entirely by luck.

316
00:19:35,496 --> 00:19:46,837
Rym: I Wanted my comment to do really like cool things like go between two planets and a figure eight kind of thing and I Pulled that off a lot a whole bunch of times, and I thought I figured this out.

317
00:19:46,877 --> 00:19:48,765
Rym: then I realized that now It was totally random.

318
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:51,400
Rym: there was no amount of skill involved in that whatsoever.

319
00:19:52,022 --> 00:19:55,231
Scott: Yeah, you tried to find a lagrange point, and it you totally didn't find one.

320
00:19:55,272 --> 00:19:58,504
Rym: well as we determined the lagrange point was between two Pixels.

321
00:19:58,524 --> 00:19:59,372
Rym: so fuck that game.

322
00:19:59,554 --> 00:20:01,124
Scott: yeah All right.

323
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:14,080
Scott: my thing today is video from the Wii factory Where they make Or at least where they package the Wiis and where they also package the Wiimotes and the Zeldas.

324
00:20:15,003 --> 00:20:16,048
Scott: It's pretty impressive.

325
00:20:16,128 --> 00:20:19,643
Scott: if you look at the rate at which they make Wiis and Zeldas It's literally.

326
00:20:19,683 --> 00:20:22,054
Rym: it's like we are we are we are we?

327
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,232
Rym: Zelda Zelda Zelda Zelda Zelda Zelda Zelda Zelda.

328
00:20:26,332 --> 00:20:28,100
Scott: well, it's more like Zelda Zelda Zelda.

329
00:20:28,522 --> 00:20:29,870
Scott: It's like a Zelda a second.

330
00:20:29,991 --> 00:20:34,388
Scott: alright if I did the math They got ten days until this thing is out in stores.

331
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:48,319
Scott: if they continue to keep this factory running and they actually are Manufacturing things at the rate at which you see them manufactured in the video They're gonna make 800,000 plus more Wiis between now and when it comes out.

332
00:20:48,883 --> 00:21:00,292
Rym: I just like I mean you see this line this conveyor belt And there's so many Wiis coming off of it at such a rate, and then you know I kind of picture What's the ps3 line looking like.

333
00:21:00,554 --> 00:21:01,417
Scott: it's probably like the s3?

334
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:02,923
Rym: Broken ps3.

335
00:21:02,983 --> 00:21:08,807
Rym: a ps3 missing apart Just like an empty box is a ps2.

336
00:21:08,847 --> 00:21:13,531
Scott: I Really a gamecube.

337
00:21:13,631 --> 00:21:16,607
Rym: they're making what not like 200,000 ps3s.

338
00:21:16,888 --> 00:21:20,140
Rym: they make that many Wiis in like a day or two in a few days.

339
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:27,420
Scott: Yeah, yeah, at least if the rate of this factory in the video is to be assumed I'm sure there's like issues getting enough chips.

340
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,840
Scott: You know eventually this factory is gonna run out of chips and they'll have to wait for another shipment.

341
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,003
Scott: Maybe who knows.

342
00:21:32,364 --> 00:21:45,980
Rym: cuz I'll say when I worked at IBM, and you know the factory pretty much was going at full steam 24/7 all the time nothing ever really got hold held up because there weren't enough of a chip because they plan that shit out.

343
00:21:46,783 --> 00:21:51,900
Rym: I mean you plan I could go and actually I could go into really cool detail about how factories plan.

344
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:58,017
Rym: You know the way They'll figure out their inventory and how to track things through the factory in different pads.

345
00:21:58,037 --> 00:22:01,534
Rym: yeah all the fun stuff I learned at IBM that is in no way applicable to any job.

346
00:22:01,574 --> 00:22:02,540
Rym: I'll ever want to have again.

347
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,607
Scott: Yeah, but this video might not even be the factory.

348
00:22:04,628 --> 00:22:08,682
Scott: it might just be the packaging and warehouse because that's the only parts you Actually see.

349
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,713
Scott: like you see people taking wiimotes that are already made and packaging them.

350
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:14,625
Rym: you see all the minimum wage workers Drop in that's.

351
00:22:14,906 --> 00:22:16,594
Scott: this is the hilarious part of the video.

352
00:22:16,654 --> 00:22:17,960
Scott: is the minimum wage workers?

353
00:22:18,861 --> 00:22:23,937
Scott: Because this is one guy who has the saddest job in the world and his face is so sad.

354
00:22:23,997 --> 00:22:32,899
Scott: all he does is Weaves in cardboard boxes come down a conveyor belt and the conveyor belt is wide enough for two We boxes side by side.

355
00:22:33,261 --> 00:22:44,600
Scott: But the weeboxes come down one at a time and now they could easily make some sort of little Mechanism to put the weeboxes side by side in rows of two in a two by two instead of one by one.

356
00:22:45,222 --> 00:22:52,005
Scott: This guy is using his hands to move the wee boxes to make them two by two Instead of one by one.

357
00:22:52,225 --> 00:22:52,567
Rym: see now.

358
00:22:52,607 --> 00:22:54,012
Rym: That's a big thing in factories.

359
00:22:54,152 --> 00:22:57,525
Rym: Oh well first off this guy looks really Really sad.

360
00:22:57,545 --> 00:23:02,937
Scott: he is so sad like I just feel bad looking at him like oh, man Where did your life go wrong?

361
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,180
Rym: Well it harkens back to when I had that factory job working for what I think was Pillsbury.

362
00:23:08,441 --> 00:23:10,750
Rym: Yeah, well I say I had a factory job.

363
00:23:11,091 --> 00:23:13,420
Rym: I worked there for exactly eight hours.

364
00:23:15,243 --> 00:23:17,111
Rym: Total it's one shift and my job.

365
00:23:17,131 --> 00:23:20,437
Rym: This is what I was really poor at RIT And I took a whole bunch of temp jobs.

366
00:23:20,761 --> 00:23:31,300
Rym: I was a Jewish caterer a bunch of times which was actually kind of fun Yeah, but I had to stand there, and there's this giant machine that was making a cinnamon apple pie.

367
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,896
Rym: It's like frozen apple pies like full-size pies that would be put up by Pillsbury.

368
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:41,359
Rym: at a rate It was literally pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie.

369
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:45,191
Scott: And it was that's quite a bunch of pies for a full eight hours.

370
00:23:45,232 --> 00:23:45,813
Rym: Just pies.

371
00:23:45,894 --> 00:23:47,940
Scott: are people eating pies at that rate?

372
00:23:48,022 --> 00:23:49,363
Scott: That's insane I don't even know.

373
00:23:49,403 --> 00:23:53,880
Rym: but it was literally was like all these different shoots at the end and all these people ready to box them.

374
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,955
Rym: So the pot one pie would come down one slot and be the pie pie pie pie pie.

375
00:23:57,995 --> 00:24:04,662
Rym: down all these different slots and by The time it got back to the first slot the first guy had just boxed one of the pies Man.

376
00:24:04,883 --> 00:24:09,260
Rym: like if anyone fucked up at all they blow a whistle the whole thing would stop.

377
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,579
Rym: They'd yell at someone and then it would start again.

378
00:24:12,802 --> 00:24:14,350
Rym: My job was that there were.

379
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,375
Rym: there were these tins.

380
00:24:15,395 --> 00:24:16,320
Rym: you know the pie tins.

381
00:24:16,842 --> 00:24:25,098
Rym: I would load up thousands and thousands of them like by ripping them out of boxes stacking them up Carry them over and dump them in the top of this hopper.

382
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:31,169
Rym: That was my hopper that was my entire job, I got a hopper Hopper.

383
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:40,298
Rym: hey Jerry Yeah, so for eight hours one day with a half-hour break for lunch and two 15-minute union mandated breaks for whatever.

384
00:24:40,699 --> 00:24:43,660
Rym: I carried Pie tins and dropped him in a hopper.

385
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,387
Rym: Wow yeah factory jobs suck.

386
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:51,640
Rym: anytime I see a factory job it reminds me not to complain about my job at all.

387
00:24:52,484 --> 00:24:57,619
Scott: You know the thing is for someone out there for a lot of people out there They probably could have fun with a factory job.

388
00:24:58,001 --> 00:25:13,700
Rym: Oh, yeah, cuz once you get used to that you can just hang out with the people in the factory and all the Really really poor people working in this Pillsbury factory because they were making Like the bare minimum wage at this place, and I think I was making ten cents above that because I was a contractor.

389
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:20,460
Rym: Yeah for that one day, but they really seem to enjoy themselves running around yelling at each other.

390
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,909
Rym: They had this whole kind of camaraderie thing going.

391
00:25:23,431 --> 00:25:24,656
Scott: yeah, I mean just today.

392
00:25:24,716 --> 00:25:26,506
Scott: I was listening to Like.

393
00:25:26,707 --> 00:25:26,908
Scott: it was.

394
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,633
Scott: it was a pot.

395
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:28,660
Scott: It wasn't really a podcast.

396
00:25:28,781 --> 00:25:37,120
Scott: it was a recording of a radio show, but they podcasted it of My band Doug Rushkoff and someone's interviewing about his book his newest book about.

397
00:25:37,943 --> 00:25:40,715
Scott: You know think inside the box instead of outside the box.

398
00:25:40,755 --> 00:25:41,860
Scott: I forget what the book's called.

399
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,724
Scott: I have the book.

400
00:25:42,825 --> 00:25:43,849
Scott: I want it from him.

401
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:44,432
Scott: He signed it.

402
00:25:44,754 --> 00:25:45,497
Scott: I haven't read it yet.

403
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:47,746
Rym: Yeah You wrote that essay.

404
00:25:48,026 --> 00:25:48,929
Scott: I didn't write an essay.

405
00:25:48,949 --> 00:25:50,775
Scott: it was just I. it was a little contest.

406
00:25:50,836 --> 00:25:55,352
Scott: I answered a question, but anyway The he was talking about that.

407
00:25:55,493 --> 00:26:08,920
Scott: there was a guy who was a trash man But he really enjoyed being a trash man And he optimized his trash truck so much and the way he picks up trash That the Union got pissed because he was doing it is making his route too quickly.

408
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:15,940
Scott: See I'm not gonna get out of rent here, but you could think the rant we would make about that is obvious.

409
00:26:16,601 --> 00:26:17,764
Rym: Yeah, so I think it can.

410
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:23,964
Rym: I mean Otakon has the same problem pretty much every a lot of things I run into more and more.

411
00:26:24,024 --> 00:26:27,014
Rym: I'm running into Union problems, and I don't like it.

412
00:26:27,175 --> 00:26:27,355
Scott: No.

413
00:26:27,395 --> 00:26:34,380
Scott: I don't all right Yeah, so yeah this Wii factory pretty cool with all the Wii's and all the Zelda games.

414
00:26:35,621 --> 00:26:37,308
Scott: Minimum wage workers hilarious.

415
00:26:37,589 --> 00:26:40,020
Rym: I hope that guy at least gets a Wii.

416
00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:43,674
Rym: Yeah, that guy looked like he looked different from all the other people.

417
00:26:43,694 --> 00:26:45,059
Rym: I think he made a little bit more money.

418
00:26:47,741 --> 00:26:48,905
Rym: Okay, cuz there was only.

419
00:26:49,186 --> 00:26:53,200
Rym: he was the only guy doing his job, but there was a gaggle of people doing the other jobs.

420
00:26:53,964 --> 00:26:55,977
Scott: I don't know, but they weren't making much plus.

421
00:26:55,997 --> 00:27:01,556
Rym: his badge I think was a different color was like yellowish, but that might have just been your monitor who knows okay?

422
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:06,898
Rym: Yeah, so You kind of picked our topic for today, so I think you can introduce this okay?

423
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,952
Rym: Cuz I had a different idea about what to talk about.

424
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:11,660
Scott: no idea what to talk about today.

425
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:18,397
Scott: So suddenly we came up with the idea of talking about showering and bathing in an entirely non-sexual way.

426
00:27:18,698 --> 00:27:25,577
Scott: yes But cuz you know apparently there's a lot of geeks out there who don't know how to shower and bathe properly.

427
00:27:25,637 --> 00:27:35,117
Scott: however and also Even if you do know how to shower and bathe properly and you do so there are many hilarious Anecdotes that can go along with such a simple everyday task.

428
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:45,273
Rym: Yeah, I think back to an episode of Seinfeld where Kramer was talking about how it takes him forever to get ready like in the Morning like they're gonna go somewhere, and they're like Kramer.

429
00:27:45,293 --> 00:27:45,956
Rym: Just go take a shower.

430
00:27:45,976 --> 00:27:53,547
Rym: We'll go when he's like What I need like two hours, and they're like what and it turns out that Kramer Just didn't actually know how to shower.

431
00:27:53,868 --> 00:28:09,860
Rym: so he asked Jerry for help and they get in the bathtub With or the the shower with bath bathing suits on and Jerry shows him how to shower like Don't wash each part of the body and rinse it wash the whole body then rinse the whole body And it was actually a really funny episode.

432
00:28:11,581 --> 00:28:17,785
Scott: Yeah, there's many other things talk about too like water pressure and Hard water and soft water.

433
00:28:17,805 --> 00:28:19,311
Scott: remember the episode where they had the hair was on.

434
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:24,247
Rym: Seinfeld actually talks about this topic quite a bit Because it's a really important topic in New York City.

435
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:26,254
Scott: Yeah, I guess it is low flow.

436
00:28:26,274 --> 00:28:30,326
Rym: I don't like this one bit Plus.

437
00:28:30,346 --> 00:28:32,019
Rym: we got that new technology to talk about.

438
00:28:33,684 --> 00:28:35,640
Scott: I think that's how we came up with the idea for this episode.

439
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:45,983
Rym: Yeah, even though I wanted to talk about bad professors and teachers But we we Scott decided and I kind of agree now that we should probably think on that because I got to make sure I Remember I'd

440
00:28:46,023 --> 00:28:49,859
Scott: have to go through it grade by grade writing down teachers and what they did.

441
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:51,798
Rym: well I had a lot of nuns as teachers.

442
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:58,880
Rym: oh And one of them was a millionaire gave up her fortune really wow and you know what she didn't look very happy.

443
00:29:01,453 --> 00:29:04,087
Scott: Okay So Showering and bathing.

444
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:05,796
Scott: how do you take a shower?

445
00:29:05,897 --> 00:29:06,420
Rym: well Scott?

446
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:14,488
Rym: And I have very different shower procedures in ways that the more I've lived with him the more I've learned that we're very different in that way.

447
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:25,240
Rym: one aside from all that I have very long hair so Showering is a 15-minute deal for me, and then another half hour at least worth of dealing with my hair.

448
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:28,331
Scott: Yeah, and sometimes you don't even deal with the hair.

449
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:32,199
Rym: Oh, yeah, if I need to take a quick shower I wash all of my body except the hair.

450
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,567
Scott: Yeah, I shampoo every time.

451
00:29:33,829 --> 00:29:38,797
Rym: see I can't because once my hair gets wet I either have to do stuff to it or put on a hat.

452
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:46,520
Rym: yeah Plus if I want a shower at night, and I get my hair wet I can't really go to bed with wet hair, and I can't quickly dry my hair.

453
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,287
Rym: It takes a long time for my hair to dry mmm.

454
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,595
Scott: Yeah, see I just shampoo every time.

455
00:29:50,636 --> 00:30:07,039
Scott: the thing is my showers Can either be like one-minute affairs in which I clean myself in the shortest amount of time possible Or they can be like five to ten minute affairs where I wake up in the morning in the shower Or they could be longer where I spend a lot of time just relaxing in the hot water going.

456
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,479
Rym: ah Yeah, I've often taken very long showers just for the fun of it.

457
00:30:11,661 --> 00:30:27,865
Rym: Yeah But I mean if the only consolation I guess I could ever have if I got cancer and I had to go through Chemotherapy was that if I lost all my hair, and I ended up being bald Showering I could wake up an hour later and still make it to work on time I could.

458
00:30:28,186 --> 00:30:30,720
Rym: I could shave and shower inside of five minutes.

459
00:30:33,042 --> 00:30:35,211
Scott: See like I kind of want to be bald for the comfort.

460
00:30:35,472 --> 00:30:37,260
Scott: the only reason I don't I'll shave your head.

461
00:30:37,581 --> 00:30:41,438
Scott: Yeah, I'll shave your head is because then there would be problems in the hair.

462
00:30:41,478 --> 00:30:41,880
Scott: grew back.

463
00:30:42,021 --> 00:30:42,929
Rym: No, you just keep shaving it.

464
00:30:42,949 --> 00:30:43,857
Rym: What if you look like Yasu?

465
00:30:45,145 --> 00:30:46,279
Scott: I don't think I look like Yasu.

466
00:30:46,561 --> 00:30:52,880
Rym: You could probably pull it off if you shaved all the hair from the neck up and your dark sunglasses and smoked black cigarettes.

467
00:30:53,161 --> 00:30:56,534
Rym: No, it's not gonna happen, and we're awesome, and we're in a rock band.

468
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:58,120
Scott: I'm awesome, but I'm not in a rock band.

469
00:30:59,521 --> 00:31:02,310
Scott: Okay, so my shower procedure is pretty simple.

470
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,597
Rym: I didn't actually tell my shower procedure.

471
00:31:04,637 --> 00:31:05,440
Rym: I guess you can do yours.

472
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,493
Scott: Mine's real simple, so I'll go first right yeah, cuz captain doesn't use a washcloth.

473
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:11,560
Scott: Just hey I use a sponge.

474
00:31:11,801 --> 00:31:14,268
Rym: Yeah, that's a recent development for most of your life.

475
00:31:14,348 --> 00:31:18,700
Rym: apparently you just take a bar of soap and rub it all over your body.

476
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,644
Rym: What's wrong with that?

477
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:20,990
Rym: It's not how you shower.

478
00:31:21,111 --> 00:31:21,914
Scott: That's how they shower.

479
00:31:21,935 --> 00:31:23,080
Scott: and all the commercials on TV.

480
00:31:23,461 --> 00:31:23,802
Rym: You know what.

481
00:31:23,822 --> 00:31:25,368
Rym: that's not how humans shower.

482
00:31:25,488 --> 00:31:27,274
Rym: Why not supposed to shower that way.

483
00:31:27,555 --> 00:31:28,980
Rym: Why not doesn't it work so well?

484
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:29,884
Scott: It works just fine.

485
00:31:29,925 --> 00:31:30,588
Scott: I'm very clean.

486
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:37,544
Rym: see I was the opposite tech in that I Rarely use soap My whole life.

487
00:31:37,744 --> 00:31:39,671
Rym: I never really use soap.

488
00:31:39,751 --> 00:31:42,320
Rym: when I showered you know what I smell just fine.

489
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,567
Scott: Anyway, I get in the shower.

490
00:31:44,748 --> 00:31:50,040
Scott: I turn on the bathtub part, and then I turn on the shower part But I sure to aim it away from me, so I don't get wet right away.

491
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,149
Scott: I got to make sure the temperature is just right.

492
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:57,100
Scott: you know cuz sometimes you turn the water on right away And it'll be the first time the showers been turned on in the morning.

493
00:31:57,421 --> 00:31:59,970
Scott: So it'll be cold cold cold cold warm warm warm warm.

494
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,980
Rym: the worst is when you're taking a shower in an unfamiliar bathroom.

495
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:13,068
Rym: Okay, cuz every bathroom has its own little like mystery of how it works like the spots where it is and the thresholds and How hot the hot water is now cold.

496
00:32:13,088 --> 00:32:18,593
Scott: the cold water is and the worst is if you can't Like it used to turn the shower on then it blasts you.

497
00:32:18,694 --> 00:32:24,140
Scott: I always jump even though I know it's coming and that's why I have to have the handheld one so I can aim it away for myself.

498
00:32:24,462 --> 00:32:27,540
Rym: The worst is you know like some are real loose.

499
00:32:27,701 --> 00:32:32,060
Rym: You know like you turn the thing half a turn and the temperature barely changes.

500
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:37,257
Rym: And then there's some where you just kind of tap the top it with your pinky, and it's 10 degrees hotter.

501
00:32:37,438 --> 00:32:40,752
Rym: Yeah Yeah, cuz it also doesn't help that our house.

502
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,500
Rym: We have a somewhat small water heater.

503
00:32:42,901 --> 00:32:51,749
Rym: It's a mini water heater so in order to have and also the water heater is hooked in with our heat because we have gas Heat that heats water and pumps it through radiators all around the house.

504
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:56,160
Rym: modern good radiators, not old shitty steam radiators.

505
00:32:56,481 --> 00:32:58,227
Scott: Yeah, it's a it's an okay system.

506
00:32:58,388 --> 00:32:59,753
Rym: Yeah, it's actually a really good system.

507
00:32:59,793 --> 00:33:07,807
Rym: It saves us a lot of money in the winter yep, but as a result our hot water is Just shy of boiling.

508
00:33:07,847 --> 00:33:10,479
Rym: you can just use our tap to cook ramen.

509
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:16,076
Rym: Probably our tap will scald you if you just turn on our hot water and get it on your skin.

510
00:33:16,498 --> 00:33:17,280
Rym: It is dangerous.

511
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:18,866
Scott: Yeah, I like that way.

512
00:33:18,927 --> 00:33:22,240
Rym: I like it that way too because we've never run out of hot water.

513
00:33:22,721 --> 00:33:24,988
Scott: Yeah, yeah, so I get in the shower.

514
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:26,393
Scott: I get I get all you know.

515
00:33:26,614 --> 00:33:28,620
Scott: I let the warm water heat me up.

516
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,343
Scott: It feels good.

517
00:33:29,685 --> 00:33:32,419
Scott: I get my hair wet, but I what hair I have at the time.

518
00:33:33,402 --> 00:33:45,447
Scott: And then I get some shampoo, and I go Rinse it out and then depending on what kind of a rush I'm in if I'm not in a rush I take out my sponge and I put some soap on it and then I go Shoo-shoo-shoo-shoo-shoo.

519
00:33:45,467 --> 00:33:47,880
Rym: See I'm glad that you have added the sponge to your repertoire.

520
00:33:48,102 --> 00:33:50,984
Scott: I don't know what the sponge feels nice But I don't see how it.

521
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:57,272
Scott: you know that much different because it scrapes your skin it exfoliates it pulls off Just a bunch of womanly whatnot?

522
00:33:57,313 --> 00:34:02,511
Rym: no Yeah, are you saying that exfoliation doesn't actually happen.

523
00:34:02,973 --> 00:34:03,233
Scott: No.

524
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,580
Scott: I'm saying is it's all a bunch of BS crap.

525
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:13,829
Scott: They used to sell shit at the bed bath and whatever Scott you can exfoliate with your hands and water anyway.

526
00:34:15,422 --> 00:34:19,574
Scott: So and then if I'm in a rush though I just take a bar of soap and I rub it on myself, and then I run away.

527
00:34:19,755 --> 00:34:20,600
Rym: that doesn't work.

528
00:34:21,163 --> 00:34:23,739
Scott: It works just fine, and then you know I'll.

529
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:25,286
Scott: You know I'll take the.

530
00:34:25,406 --> 00:34:28,719
Scott: if I have a shower massaging thing that I can take off the hook which I do.

531
00:34:29,022 --> 00:34:30,559
Rym: I don't want to hear about what you do with that.

532
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,743
Scott: Just clean down.

533
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,467
Scott: see you gotta have one of those cuz.

534
00:34:34,507 --> 00:34:38,460
Scott: how else can you clean down under where the shower can't hit you know?

535
00:34:38,981 --> 00:34:40,710
Scott: I don't understand like you go it.

536
00:34:40,991 --> 00:34:42,880
Scott: They just have a shower head mounted on the wall.

537
00:34:43,121 --> 00:34:47,165
Scott: There's no way to get that to hit you in the taint Like stand upside down in the shower.

538
00:34:47,446 --> 00:34:54,906
Rym: actually what I've done on numerous occasions is I'm actually kind of flexible for the kind Considering that I'm a 24 or 25 year old.

539
00:34:55,045 --> 00:34:55,367
Rym: I'm 24 right?

540
00:34:55,387 --> 00:34:56,089
Rym: yeah, yeah 24 year old.

541
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:57,352
Rym: You're gonna be 25 real soon.

542
00:34:57,412 --> 00:35:06,020
Rym: Yeah I am but I can pretty much lift my leg high enough and stand at an angle to wash my tank.

543
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,952
Scott: No, I don't die if I can't get water to blast into the taint.

544
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,260
Rym: I'll just I'll kind of go like this.

545
00:35:12,482 --> 00:35:13,513
Rym: I'm doing it right now.

546
00:35:13,817 --> 00:35:17,575
Rym: Oh I'm wearing clothes, but see you can't do this shit.

547
00:35:17,876 --> 00:35:21,090
Scott: I could do that shit You couldn't but I don't want to do that.

548
00:35:21,451 --> 00:35:23,520
Rym: what I'll do is I'll do what I just did.

549
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:28,619
Scott: I'll just take soap and rub it down there, and then I'll cup water with my hands and splash it or I'll get down like this.

550
00:35:29,721 --> 00:35:30,403
Scott: That's no good.

551
00:35:30,864 --> 00:35:31,988
Rym: It works really well.

552
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:35,800
Scott: another option is to just you know get the sponge and rub it down there.

553
00:35:36,222 --> 00:35:46,900
Scott: Or you know I could turn the tub on and then like get down into the the tub Blaster like just lay down in the shower, but that's kind of gross if the shower isn't clean which it's kind of dirty in there.

554
00:35:47,261 --> 00:35:49,609
Scott: Yeah, so the tub part is still really clean.

555
00:35:49,629 --> 00:35:49,730
Scott: No.

556
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:50,131
Rym: It's not.

557
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:51,717
Rym: there's stuff growing down there again.

558
00:35:51,737 --> 00:35:52,600
Scott: It's nothing growing on.

559
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,126
Rym: There's a big stain.

560
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:54,628
Scott: No it's.

561
00:35:54,768 --> 00:35:56,856
Scott: it's better than it ever has been it's not.

562
00:35:56,917 --> 00:35:57,760
Scott: it's right back to the way.

563
00:35:58,161 --> 00:35:58,965
Scott: Oh, it's not.

564
00:35:59,005 --> 00:35:59,206
Rym: yes.

565
00:35:59,246 --> 00:35:59,627
Scott: It is.

566
00:35:59,687 --> 00:36:00,029
Scott: It's not.

567
00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:02,117
Rym: I'll bring in two objective witnesses tomorrow.

568
00:36:02,237 --> 00:36:02,860
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

569
00:36:03,681 --> 00:36:06,193
Scott: Anyway, yeah, so I just cleaned my hair.

570
00:36:06,213 --> 00:36:07,600
Scott: I cleaned the rest of my body.

571
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:11,800
Scott: I make sure I clean my feet like in between the toes behind the ears and all that.

572
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:16,720
Rym: That's something that bothers me because while you've had a couple of fungus on your feet your feet are pretty good.

573
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,173
Rym: They don't smell bad usually.

574
00:36:18,213 --> 00:36:25,556
Scott: they don't Smell bad if I'm wearing sneakers all day and running around and sweating in my socks And then at the end of the day I go.

575
00:36:25,577 --> 00:36:36,210
Rym: ah But I saw statistics a while ago that apparently like 80% of Americans have Moderate to serious fungus problems on their feet and their toenails.

576
00:36:36,371 --> 00:36:37,534
Scott: whoa look at my.

577
00:36:37,594 --> 00:36:39,980
Scott: my toenails look clean clear white.

578
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,927
Scott: Yeah, it's white and pink.

579
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:41,693
Scott: those the only colors.

580
00:36:41,713 --> 00:36:44,425
Rym: Yeah, I go step further And I'm dead serious.

581
00:36:44,746 --> 00:36:51,837
Rym: my feet almost never smell at all and numerous people have pointed this out to me Like they just never smell like anything.

582
00:36:52,482 --> 00:36:59,036
Rym: Hmm, I blame mostly the fact that I'm always barefoot and I wash my feet But I can't understand how so many people have such disgusting feet.

583
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:01,324
Rym: wash them Yeah, that's all.

584
00:37:01,365 --> 00:37:10,660
Scott: you get soap on the feet rub them a little bit get soap between the toes And then take your handheld shower massager and blast your feet so that they get all the shit off.

585
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,220
Rym: Well, I think that one of the other big keys is to not really paint your toenails.

586
00:37:14,522 --> 00:37:15,227
Scott: Yeah, I don't know why.

587
00:37:15,549 --> 00:37:17,000
Scott: I don't understand why women do that.

588
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:22,040
Scott: I don't want to turn the topic of the show into toenail painting, but do you think toenail painting is attractive?

589
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:23,820
Rym: I am mostly indifferent.

590
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:29,580
Scott: That's what I'm saying is that most guys are completely indifferent to toenail painting like they don't care if they're painted or not.

591
00:37:29,861 --> 00:37:30,724
Scott: There's a few guys.

592
00:37:30,865 --> 00:37:35,060
Scott: I'm sure that have like a toenail painting fetish, but most guys that I know are indifferent.

593
00:37:35,221 --> 00:37:39,080
Scott: Yeah, women insist on doing it some paying a lot of money for pedicures.

594
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:39,723
Scott: You know what though?

595
00:37:39,783 --> 00:37:40,929
Rym: a lot of awesome women don't.

596
00:37:41,311 --> 00:37:48,939
Scott: yeah, pedicure is a lot different from painting And I know but I like that usually pedicure followed by nail painting and all kinds of craziness.

597
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:50,123
Rym: actually I should go get a pedicure.

598
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:54,858
Scott: I mean, I don't even like hand fingernails, you know, see I'm just generally.

599
00:37:54,878 --> 00:37:57,210
Rym: I Generally dislike makeup.

600
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:59,040
Rym: I like yeah made on makeup.

601
00:37:59,481 --> 00:38:01,207
Rym: Granted makeup is cool.

602
00:38:01,688 --> 00:38:08,929
Rym: You know, like if you're going to a formal ball like a fancy party It's cool to get all dressed like we're gonna be on TV or on stage.

603
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:12,560
Rym: I have worn makeup on a several occasions.

604
00:38:14,021 --> 00:38:16,086
Scott: Wow, I know I know you're gay.

605
00:38:16,648 --> 00:38:18,914
Rym: No, but way back when the RIT Anime Club.

606
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:21,420
Rym: I was pretty much I was guaranteed to be president.

607
00:38:21,581 --> 00:38:32,080
Rym: I've been on the eboard everyone knew me everyone loved me But I was actually living way out of town during the elections So I couldn't give a speech or anything and it didn't matter because I was running unopposed.

608
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,959
Rym: But then someone decided to run against me.

609
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:47,620
Rym: So I there was no danger of me losing but I had to give a little speech and videotape it and mail it back to Rochester so they could show it to the club where I basically said All right, everyone vote for me and I actually put on some makeup.

610
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:54,379
Rym: So I'd look better because my camera was kind of shitty and the light was really shitty and I recorded it once and I looked Kind of a bit shit.

611
00:38:55,541 --> 00:39:01,041
Rym: So I powdered my face and then I put on a little bit and I looked a lot better and then I did it take Two.

612
00:39:01,703 --> 00:39:03,750
Scott: So what's your shower methodology?

613
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:04,071
Scott: Mr.

614
00:39:04,131 --> 00:39:04,874
Scott: Fancy pants.

615
00:39:05,034 --> 00:39:05,375
Rym: All right.

616
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:06,359
Rym: All right fancy pants.

617
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,219
Rym: now I've been all right, so I get in the shower.

618
00:39:09,561 --> 00:39:18,631
Rym: Well first I lay in my room and I do as many sit-ups as I can until I shower because then I get all sweaty And it wakes me up real quick.

619
00:39:18,651 --> 00:39:22,371
Rym: So I don't wake up in the shower All right, and then, you know, I go into the shower.

620
00:39:22,411 --> 00:39:23,174
Rym: I set up.

621
00:39:23,215 --> 00:39:24,159
Scott: I wake up in the shower.

622
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:27,952
Rym: I Usually brush my teeth first before I get in the shower.

623
00:39:27,972 --> 00:39:28,655
Rym: Huh?

624
00:39:28,736 --> 00:39:29,600
Rym: That way I'm done with it.

625
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,443
Rym: I was out of the way.

626
00:39:30,564 --> 00:39:34,519
Rym: It's done that taste that you wake up with in the morning is already gone.

627
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,206
Scott: Mmm, see in the shower.

628
00:39:36,226 --> 00:39:38,395
Scott: I let like because they blast pretty hard.

629
00:39:38,415 --> 00:39:40,824
Scott: I'm all about high water pressure So I blast.

630
00:39:40,885 --> 00:39:49,390
Scott: I let the shower blast into my mouth and then I brush the teeth, you know Cuz all that fungus growing in that nasty busted old showerhead?

631
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,054
Scott: no, it's not fungus growing in there.

632
00:39:51,435 --> 00:39:54,343
Rym: Uh, yeah there is it's fine It's there.

633
00:39:54,363 --> 00:39:57,253
Rym: There's a lot of mold and other things growing.

634
00:39:57,314 --> 00:39:58,237
Rym: Whatever.

635
00:39:58,337 --> 00:39:58,939
Rym: I'll show it to you.

636
00:39:59,805 --> 00:40:00,509
Rym: You want me to show it to you?

637
00:40:00,529 --> 00:40:02,200
Rym: Do you believe it's there but you five bucks is there?

638
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,425
Scott: It's not gonna hurt you?

639
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:06,040
Rym: not probably not but I'd rather just brush my teeth.

640
00:40:06,481 --> 00:40:12,540
Rym: Anyway, and then you know while I'm brushing my teeth about halfway through I turn on the tub on hot.

641
00:40:13,002 --> 00:40:16,120
Rym: That way all the cold water in the pipe gets rushed out like a bum.

642
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:21,345
Scott: So my problem is I go in and I pee and I flush and then I jump in the shower right away And now I got away.

643
00:40:21,425 --> 00:40:22,730
Rym: Oh, see I just pee in the shower.

644
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:23,775
Scott: I don't do that.

645
00:40:24,036 --> 00:40:24,980
Rym: I always pee in the shower.

646
00:40:26,461 --> 00:40:28,145
Rym: If I shower I probably pee.

647
00:40:28,165 --> 00:40:28,807
Rym: Yeah.

648
00:40:29,248 --> 00:40:29,589
Rym: All right.

649
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:32,095
Rym: I'll make the Seinfeld argument the George Costanza argument.

650
00:40:32,616 --> 00:40:33,799
Rym: It's all tubes.

651
00:40:34,444 --> 00:40:46,560
Scott: so, you know what the thing is is If I go into the bathroom to shower I have an urge to pee like if I go in I pee then I just walk out of the bathroom and walk back in Immediately like I'm gonna shower.

652
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:52,302
Scott: I'll have to pee again no matter what really and like a one drop of pee will come out and then I can get in the Shower.

653
00:40:52,623 --> 00:41:06,820
Scott: Wow, it's like my body knows when I go into a bathroom and the pee sensor just turns on automatically How it works, but it must be some connection there like entering a bathroom gotta pee.

654
00:41:07,101 --> 00:41:13,363
Rym: See I pretty much just I saw the hot waters going and then I finished brushing my teeth and right about then is when the scalding Water comes out.

655
00:41:13,403 --> 00:41:16,757
Scott: It's like if I was running away from the police and they chased me into a bathroom.

656
00:41:16,797 --> 00:41:18,701
Scott: I'd have to pee Huh?

657
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:19,243
Scott: Yeah.

658
00:41:19,423 --> 00:41:20,205
Scott: All right continue.

659
00:41:20,546 --> 00:41:25,660
Rym: See I wonder though if you had that urge and the police could you would you just pee your pants?

660
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:30,519
Scott: I might be the police Because I guess if I'm in a bathroom, it's probably a dead end.

661
00:41:30,881 --> 00:41:32,225
Scott: So it's time to give up.

662
00:41:32,245 --> 00:41:34,172
Scott: but if I'm gonna give up I'm gonna pee on the police.

663
00:41:34,653 --> 00:41:36,600
Rym: I cannot pee my pants.

664
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,631
Rym: Furthermore I cannot like I could.

665
00:41:40,651 --> 00:41:46,142
Scott: if I and just sat there and held it in forever And I was in a car on a long trip and there's nowhere to stop It would.

666
00:41:46,162 --> 00:41:54,019
Scott: I would eventually no longer be able to hold it after a long period of time or if I've got punched in the gut Of course that would immediately spill it out.

667
00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:01,280
Rym: But no there were a couple times where I'd be driving in a long road trip and I'd have a large empty water bottle or Something and I'm making good time.

668
00:42:01,402 --> 00:42:02,198
Rym: I don't want to stop.

669
00:42:02,701 --> 00:42:18,939
Rym: So I'd try to pee into something and I found that I simply could not Bring my body to open that little orifice and let my dragon drain When I was in a car or in any place other than a place for peeing.

670
00:42:19,642 --> 00:42:20,928
Rym: Now a tree is a place for peeing.

671
00:42:20,948 --> 00:42:23,159
Rym: pretty much any open space is a place for peeing.

672
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:28,316
Rym: Yeah, but if I'm sitting down and a car can't pee I've never tried it.

673
00:42:29,942 --> 00:42:32,670
Rym: It's actually it takes a little bit more logistical planning.

674
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:35,760
Scott: did I imagine the hardest part would be continuing to drive safely?

675
00:42:36,182 --> 00:42:38,595
Rym: No, really easy actually because it was Canada.

676
00:42:38,615 --> 00:42:39,560
Rym: It was a straight flat.

677
00:42:40,801 --> 00:42:42,328
Scott: That'll do it with cruise control.

678
00:42:42,709 --> 00:42:44,276
Rym: Like there wasn't even a chance of deer.

679
00:42:44,336 --> 00:42:45,200
Rym: It's just nothing.

680
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,130
Rym: I mean, maybe I'll run into a Tim Hortons.

681
00:42:48,171 --> 00:42:49,134
Scott: How do you shower?

682
00:42:49,756 --> 00:42:50,760
Rym: Oh, yeah showers.

683
00:42:52,201 --> 00:42:58,259
Rym: So I get that water pretty much one step away from burning me to death and I stand there for a good five minutes.

684
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:58,400
Rym: just.

685
00:43:01,602 --> 00:43:02,243
Scott: Yeah, I love that.

686
00:43:02,364 --> 00:43:05,774
Scott: it's like the best feeling except for drinking orange juice, which is a better feeling.

687
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:10,952
Rym: and of course see sometimes I'll drink orange juice and do all that before I get in the shower.

688
00:43:11,192 --> 00:43:12,096
Scott: Oh, no, I can't do that.

689
00:43:12,236 --> 00:43:15,248
Rym: I'll run downstairs I'll drink a giant glass of orange juice.

690
00:43:15,268 --> 00:43:15,870
Rym: Then I'll come up.

691
00:43:15,911 --> 00:43:16,633
Scott: No, I can't do.

692
00:43:16,673 --> 00:43:20,627
Scott: I gotta drink it right before I leave the house All right, so

693
00:43:20,647 --> 00:43:30,718
Rym: then I'll be in the shower hot water and I you know rub my body down relax a bit And then I take the shampoo of which I have three different kinds that I thought that I alternate

694
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:31,500
Scott: whatever.

695
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:32,884
Scott: It's all the same shit.

696
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:33,366
Rym: No, it's not.

697
00:43:33,446 --> 00:43:38,319
Rym: cuz I actually in about two and a half seasons out of the air I'll get dandruff.

698
00:43:38,846 --> 00:43:45,286
Rym: so I use Selsun blue once or twice a week because that is like Fucking dandruff death right there.

699
00:43:45,407 --> 00:43:46,611
Rym: that kills all the dandruff.

700
00:43:46,671 --> 00:43:56,974
Rym: all the tea gel kills the dandruff but that gives you cancer also Yeah, because it contains I forget what it can do coal tar Whatever it's called Selsun blue actually works better than that stuff.

701
00:43:57,015 --> 00:43:58,700
Rym: Anyway, yeah according to several stuff.

702
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,028
Scott: Well, it depends on there's different causes of dandruff.

703
00:44:01,048 --> 00:44:01,550
Scott: It depends.

704
00:44:01,851 --> 00:44:04,400
Rym: Well, the most common cause of dandruff is a fungus.

705
00:44:04,521 --> 00:44:07,040
Scott: Yeah, so if you got the fungus one the Selsun blue works great.

706
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,439
Rym: If you have the other kinds you should go to a doctor because you've got problems.

707
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:13,260
Rym: Yeah, but yeah, so I use the Selsun once or twice a week.

708
00:44:13,341 --> 00:44:19,751
Rym: I use head and shoulders most other days and about once a week I use this other shampoo just to wash it just to kind of balance it out.

709
00:44:19,852 --> 00:44:26,493
Rym: and also see I say that but it's mostly Just because that's my travel shampoo and it's a big thing.

710
00:44:26,554 --> 00:44:28,239
Rym: So I just kind of use it occasionally cuz.

711
00:44:28,359 --> 00:44:31,235
Scott: yeah I forgot to mention what soaps and shampoos I owe.

712
00:44:31,255 --> 00:44:32,120
Rym: you can get to that later.

713
00:44:32,341 --> 00:44:33,788
Rym: All right, cuz you wanted to know how I shower.

714
00:44:33,888 --> 00:44:38,766
Rym: Okay, cuz and that's how I know you're gay Asking Rym how we showers.

715
00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:42,920
Rym: this was all just some elaborate scheme to get me to describe myself in the shower.

716
00:44:45,504 --> 00:44:46,052
Rym: I don't know.

717
00:44:46,295 --> 00:44:50,808
Scott: anyway We're gonna run out of time.

718
00:44:51,169 --> 00:44:52,313
Rym: yes got continued.

719
00:44:52,393 --> 00:44:53,777
Scott: Okay proceed.

720
00:44:53,817 --> 00:44:54,017
Scott: Yeah.

721
00:44:54,579 --> 00:44:54,860
Rym: All right.

722
00:44:55,241 --> 00:44:59,580
Rym: So then I shampoo my hair with whatever shampoo I'm gonna use and I leave it in for like five minutes.

723
00:45:00,002 --> 00:45:04,479
Rym: Well that's going on and take a washcloth and I rub my whole body down.

724
00:45:04,983 --> 00:45:05,690
Rym: Real well.

725
00:45:05,851 --> 00:45:13,680
Rym: most specifically To paraphrase phrase George Carlin armpits asshole crotch armpits asshole crotch and then tea.

726
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,649
Rym: Well, I don't wash my teeth in the shower.

727
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:17,880
Scott: I know but that's those are the important bits.

728
00:45:18,161 --> 00:45:23,877
Rym: Yes armpits asshole crash and teeth and for the vast majority of my showers for my whole life.

729
00:45:23,998 --> 00:45:24,820
Rym: I didn't use any soap.

730
00:45:24,921 --> 00:45:27,740
Rym: I just rub myself down with really hot water and a clean washcloth.

731
00:45:29,024 --> 00:45:36,277
Rym: Now lately, I'll use shampoo because it acts more as kind of a fragrance and I smell nice for the rest of the day as opposed to smelling like nothing.

732
00:45:36,297 --> 00:45:51,439
Rym: and also lately because I've been exercising a lot and I've been doing anaerobic exercise since I'm lifting weights now and I found that when I lift weights, my sweat is a quite a bit more foul than when I do anything else.

733
00:45:52,042 --> 00:45:52,363
Rym: Mm-hmm.

734
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:53,849
Rym: It seems to be the way it rolls.

735
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:59,672
Rym: So if I lift weight, I get some smelly sweat So I use soap then to make sure that all goes away.

736
00:45:59,892 --> 00:46:03,005
Rym: But if I go running I smell normal I just happen to be sweaty.

737
00:46:03,025 --> 00:46:03,608
Rym: Mm-hmm.

738
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:10,674
Rym: Then I rinse all that off of me Then I rinse out the shampoo then I dick around for a while.

739
00:46:10,714 --> 00:46:11,617
Rym: Enjoy the hot water some more.

740
00:46:11,637 --> 00:46:12,420
Rym: rub myself down again.

741
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,720
Rym: You know, I enjoy my showers rubbing yourself down not in that way.

742
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,453
Rym: I can't really masturbate in the morning if that's what you're getting at.

743
00:46:18,553 --> 00:46:19,900
Scott: No, I can't do it in the morning either.

744
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,386
Rym: Yeah, cuz it's there.

745
00:46:21,426 --> 00:46:22,169
Rym: It's ready to go.

746
00:46:22,209 --> 00:46:24,920
Scott: Well, no, it's like if it is a morning wood and you go for it.

747
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,502
Scott: It doesn't work.

748
00:46:25,522 --> 00:46:27,630
Scott: I mean it works, but it doesn't work in a good way.

749
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:28,413
Rym: It just sucks.

750
00:46:28,594 --> 00:46:30,220
Scott: Yeah morning wood is not useful.

751
00:46:30,501 --> 00:46:31,344
Rym: No, it's useful.

752
00:46:31,524 --> 00:46:34,935
Scott: Well, it's useful for pleasuring women, but not for pleasuring yourself.

753
00:46:35,096 --> 00:46:38,773
Rym: So anyway, yeah Then I load up on the conditioner.

754
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:40,119
Rym: I use like eight different kinds.

755
00:46:40,742 --> 00:46:43,895
Rym: Okay, not like all at once like I'll use one until it runs out.

756
00:46:43,915 --> 00:46:45,180
Rym: then I buy a different one till it runs out.

757
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,304
Rym: I buy different till it runs out.

758
00:46:46,405 --> 00:46:50,259
Rym: I have this kind of random cycle where I buy whatever one smelled nice at the time.

759
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:53,507
Scott: That's usually my judgment is which one smells.

760
00:46:53,547 --> 00:46:54,089
Rym: so recently.

761
00:46:54,129 --> 00:46:57,660
Rym: I bought some suave conditioner for men and it totally sucks.

762
00:46:58,223 --> 00:47:00,274
Rym: Alright, it's just it's terrible conditioner.

763
00:47:00,294 --> 00:47:01,440
Rym: It seems to be this wave.

764
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,100
Scott: Yeah, it is not like the world's wave.

765
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:11,853
Rym: Then I leave that in for a while and I enjoy the hot water again at that point usually wash my face and start Soaking my stubble in preparation for the shave.

766
00:47:11,873 --> 00:47:19,020
Scott: Oh, yeah, if I'm gonna shave I totally just stand with my face like getting blasted by hot hot water from the shower for like a whole minute.

767
00:47:19,121 --> 00:47:28,665
Rym: But and then I jump out and shave and then here's the trick I set it to cool or coldish water and I rinse my hair Mm-hmm real.

768
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:34,140
Rym: and then I do this occasionally because it's it's a really awesome adrenaline rush.

769
00:47:34,482 --> 00:47:36,839
Rym: I'll just turn that full-on cold water and stand under it.

770
00:47:37,129 --> 00:47:52,065
Scott: Yeah If you need to wake up Like in the morning the best thing to do I only do this like if I'm super sleepy and I have to wake up real Quick is you just go in there you stand in the nice warm water and just take the knob and you go Cold normal like

771
00:47:52,206 --> 00:47:52,587
Rym: wait what?

772
00:47:52,868 --> 00:47:53,691
Rym: No, no.

773
00:47:53,731 --> 00:47:55,517
Rym: No, you're a goddamn pansy.

774
00:47:55,557 --> 00:48:05,051
Rym: if that's what you do You stand there in the water on hot and you deliberately put your hand on the dial Jerk it all the way to cold and don't move your ass.

775
00:48:05,412 --> 00:48:06,857
Scott: You know in like five seconds later.

776
00:48:06,877 --> 00:48:07,680
Scott: You're like fuck.

777
00:48:09,482 --> 00:48:22,298
Rym: In fact, you know what I have never not yelled fuck when I've done Because I don't do it often because I think this will feel really good after I get over what I've just done to myself but without fail.

778
00:48:23,841 --> 00:48:31,549
Scott: Shit see the thing is it's so much worse if you're if you have it done hot and then cold and then hot as Opposed to if you just turned it cold in the first place.

779
00:48:31,569 --> 00:48:39,848
Scott: you ever done that experiment where you have like a bucket of warm Water and a bucket of cold water like go do this If you're if you're curious take two buckets.

780
00:48:39,929 --> 00:48:45,325
Scott: fill one bucket with perfectly lukewarm tap water Like room temperature water.

781
00:48:45,646 --> 00:48:50,880
Scott: take another bucket and put cold water with a bunch of ice in it like freaking freezing cold water, right?

782
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:52,986
Scott: Put your hand in the warm water.

783
00:48:53,307 --> 00:48:54,351
Scott: it will feel warm.

784
00:48:54,952 --> 00:48:57,400
Scott: then put that same hand in the ice water.

785
00:48:57,801 --> 00:48:59,646
Scott: It will feel freezing cold.

786
00:49:00,268 --> 00:49:04,460
Scott: now take your other hand that you didn't use yet and put it in the ice cold water.

787
00:49:04,581 --> 00:49:08,119
Scott: It'll be cold but not as cold as it felt with the other hand a minute ago.

788
00:49:08,681 --> 00:49:11,509
Scott: Now take that hand and put it in the perfectly lukewarm water.

789
00:49:11,589 --> 00:49:19,160
Scott: It will feel hot like ow your temperature sensors are all relative They're not absolute, you know, which can get you into trouble sometimes.

790
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,933
Scott: But in the shower, you said it's a hot and then cold.

791
00:49:21,953 --> 00:49:27,280
Rym: Oh, man, though I gotta say it's weird cuz in the summer like I'll often take a cool shower.

792
00:49:27,602 --> 00:49:30,700
Rym: Oh, yeah, but even then I have to start with a hot shower.

793
00:49:30,961 --> 00:49:36,660
Rym: Yeah, I can't start with cold water unless it's a hundred degrees and I'm in the Sun.

794
00:49:37,403 --> 00:49:41,219
Scott: Well, the thing is if it's a hundred degrees and you're in the Sun the water is actually heating up.

795
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:43,356
Scott: So you need the cool water.

796
00:49:43,376 --> 00:49:44,764
Scott: Yeah All right.

797
00:49:44,784 --> 00:49:46,632
Scott: So what do what shampoos do I use?

798
00:49:46,672 --> 00:49:47,676
Rym: Yeah, we'll wrap this up.

799
00:49:47,696 --> 00:49:48,560
Rym: We've got a while.

800
00:49:49,002 --> 00:49:57,775
Scott: So most recently I've been using all this suave like for men Shampoos and soaps and things but I think they discontinued most of them.

801
00:49:57,835 --> 00:50:02,299
Scott: I was buying them because they were cheap And they smelled okay, they smelled kind of manly.

802
00:50:02,981 --> 00:50:10,897
Scott: But now I think most recently I bought like suave completely normal shampoo that smells like apples Which is cool because I like apples, huh?

803
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:17,100
Scott: And when I need a bar of soap, I always get coast and if coast is not available I get Irish spring.

804
00:50:17,621 --> 00:50:21,653
Rym: See it's weird because I actually really prefer lavender or lilac.

805
00:50:21,714 --> 00:50:23,820
Rym: I really like anything that has lilac smell.

806
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:24,803
Scott: Yeah, cuz they're a woman.

807
00:50:25,365 --> 00:50:25,787
Rym: Okay.

808
00:50:25,907 --> 00:50:29,460
Scott: Yeah, I just get apples or maybe like strawberries or melons.

809
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:33,397
Rym: Yeah, and apples and strawberries are so much more manly captain man fruit.

810
00:50:36,591 --> 00:50:39,735
Scott: Yeah, root is more manly than flowers, I don't know.

811
00:50:39,895 --> 00:50:41,176
Rym: lilacs are awesome.

812
00:50:41,637 --> 00:50:42,418
Scott: they're not manly.

813
00:50:42,438 --> 00:50:42,999
Rym: yeah, they are.

814
00:50:43,059 --> 00:50:44,000
Rym: they're so manly.

815
00:50:45,161 --> 00:50:48,459
Rym: Yeah to use my favorite phrase it's like two Vikings having sex.

816
00:50:49,182 --> 00:50:50,105
Scott: Yeah, all right.

817
00:50:50,828 --> 00:50:52,594
Scott: Are we done talking about showers?

818
00:50:52,714 --> 00:50:54,200
Rym: I think we're done talking about this.

819
00:50:54,842 --> 00:50:56,228
Rym: Hopefully next time we'll do.

820
00:50:56,248 --> 00:50:59,380
Rym: I don't know my idea where we're talking about bad professors.

821
00:50:59,461 --> 00:51:06,840
Scott: Yeah, all I need to do is spend like a half hour Maybe not even a half hour just like a few minutes to think about all the teachers have had throughout the years.

822
00:51:07,201 --> 00:51:08,826
Rym: See I haven't had so many bad teachers.

823
00:51:08,907 --> 00:51:12,880
Rym: I've just had really really mediocre teachers.

824
00:51:13,241 --> 00:51:15,789
Scott: Yeah, I haven't had anyone who was evil like.

825
00:51:15,829 --> 00:51:21,270
Scott: I've had some teachers who were like good, but there was a bad aspect I dropped out of like four classes.

826
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:23,038
Rym: just cuz I didn't like the cut of the teachers.

827
00:51:23,098 --> 00:51:25,381
