1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,598
Rym: It's Tuesday February 28th 2017.

2
00:00:12,598 --> 00:00:21,030
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is the ignites tonight the princes of Florence Which I've played at least one time.

3
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:23,886
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:27,358 --> 00:00:28,409
Rym: So I had a light bulb that was out.

5
00:00:28,871 --> 00:00:32,465
Rym: It was actually the last of the halogen spots in the wells in the ceiling.

6
00:00:32,987 --> 00:00:38,010
Rym: over time Every one of those halogen spots kept burning out because I don't know the power is just bad up there or something.

7
00:00:38,595 --> 00:00:40,210
Rym: So I've replaced them all with LED.

8
00:00:40,391 --> 00:00:45,728
Scott: I mean when I removed into my apartment I replaced everything with CFLs, and I haven't really had to replace any.

9
00:00:45,748 --> 00:00:48,793
Scott: yeah But I did replace them even though it's um I didn't have to.

10
00:00:48,993 --> 00:00:53,069
Scott: they weren't great with LEDs because I wanted to yep, but I didn't do that for all of them.

11
00:00:54,651 --> 00:00:55,715
Scott: They're still going.

12
00:00:55,796 --> 00:00:58,668
Scott: so it's sort of like me on two of the CFLs.

13
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:02,869
Rym: one of them Just started being super dim, so I got rid of it and one of them just burned out.

14
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:05,462
Scott: I definitely had it one burn out at some point.

15
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,010
Scott: I think it was one that was from Beacon Days.

16
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:17,374
Rym: Yeah, but I got all LEDs now and actually they're real cheap, but because I was changing that light bulb I thought I should double check all the light bulbs in the apartment And I'm replacing.

17
00:01:17,394 --> 00:01:29,965
Rym: I put replaced like there's a weird bulb that goes in like the bathroom like that is a different bulb from everything I was in the house for some stupid reason but There's this there's two lights in the bathroom and most bathrooms like a new building in New York.

18
00:01:30,026 --> 00:01:38,464
Rym: you get that like top fill light for the bathroom and you get the like the bar of lights above the mirror and I only have the bar lights above the mirror.

19
00:01:38,706 --> 00:01:39,090
Rym: I got both.

20
00:01:39,652 --> 00:01:47,389
Rym: so the top one is like this ultra bright kind of annoying buzzing fluorescent thing and The one I never knew what the one in the mirror was that ever thought about it.

21
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:54,602
Rym: But I noticed when I was doing my light bulb rampage that the one Above the mirror was way dimmer than I remembered.

22
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:58,525
Rym: so I decided to open up thinking I wonder what kind of light bulb goes in there.

23
00:01:58,545 --> 00:02:01,315
Rym: and It was the weirdest light bulb.

24
00:02:01,395 --> 00:02:05,390
Rym: I've ever had to deal with except I in doing like studio lighting.

25
00:02:06,272 --> 00:02:26,479
Rym: So I open it up and first off it's t4 lights meaning it's just fucking wires come out of the end of the bulbs Like not even like it doesn't have a mast or a socket or it's just like wires sticking out right - there's like four light bulbs in there and they're all different shapes and There's a whole bunch of text.

26
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:27,302
Rym: Mm-hmm.

27
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:32,195
Rym: And the text is like listen motherfucker These are not halogen lights.

28
00:02:32,496 --> 00:02:34,341
Rym: do not put halogen lights in here.

29
00:02:34,702 --> 00:02:36,046
Rym: These are not halogen.

30
00:02:36,528 --> 00:02:37,370
Rym: These are xenon.

31
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:39,457
Rym: Why are they xenon?

32
00:02:39,658 --> 00:02:42,332
Rym: because fuck you we're gonna be weird Mm-hmm.

33
00:02:42,573 --> 00:02:44,921
Rym: xenon as far as I know is only used in two applications.

34
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:55,034
Rym: Like I never encountered a xenon bulb outside of a spotlight like the kind you'd use in a giant room like at PAX or Headlights and cars.

35
00:02:55,736 --> 00:03:04,570
Rym: Mm-hmm Giant warnings pasted all over the inside of this fixture that I had never opened until today.

36
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:06,290
Scott: Is there like a model number on the fixture?

37
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,090
Scott: Like you could look it up or something cuz I had to buy a replacement filter for about the hood over my oven.

38
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:12,090
Rym: Oh, yeah.

39
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:27,400
Scott: so I looked on the inside of it and there was a sticker and I looked it up online and actually I have the most popular possible kind of range hood and I went on Amazon and I just searched for range hood filter and the first filter the most popular filter Was the filter that I needed

40
00:03:27,622 --> 00:03:28,770
Rym: is the grease filter in the top.

41
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,901
Scott: Yeah, that one right which I haven't replaced it.

42
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:32,187
Scott: I replaced it once and all the time.

43
00:03:32,227 --> 00:03:35,556
Scott: I've lived there Every six months.

44
00:03:35,797 --> 00:03:38,570
Rym: I just soak them in things to remove all the grease and put it back in.

45
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:42,104
Scott: I hadn't done anything to it since I moved in in 2009.

46
00:03:42,104 --> 00:03:44,072
Rym: So I'll warn you there there's grease You don't know.

47
00:03:44,152 --> 00:03:47,504
Scott: don't think that the person who lived there before me did so either.

48
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,390
Scott: Yeah, so it was quite an old filter.

49
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:54,467
Rym: I a while ago actually cleaned the grease out of just the innards of that whole range hood.

50
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:55,130
Scott: Yeah, I don't need to do that.

51
00:03:55,371 --> 00:03:56,119
Rym: Yeah, I went in there.

52
00:03:56,523 --> 00:04:03,707
Rym: There was a Shocking amount of grease like I want to say there was half a pint all told I'm not going in there.

53
00:04:03,747 --> 00:04:06,095
Rym: Yeah, it's in there It's hanging out.

54
00:04:06,115 --> 00:04:06,537
Rym: It's not good.

55
00:04:06,597 --> 00:04:06,818
Rym: Someday.

56
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:07,581
Rym: It'll catch fire.

57
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:15,423
Rym: No, but uh, so anyway, uh, It says like 50 watt t4 xenon and a bunch of other shit.

58
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:22,510
Rym: So I paste that into Amazon like you do and All the results that come up look fine.

59
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,663
Rym: They actually look like the bulbs that are in there, but they don't actually say xenon.

60
00:04:28,265 --> 00:04:29,347
Rym: They just say bulb.

61
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:30,270
Rym: so I get.

62
00:04:30,752 --> 00:04:35,310
Rym: So I dig around a little bit and every one of these bulbs is a halogen ball.

63
00:04:36,552 --> 00:04:42,460
Rym: The thing that the thing said do not put in me So I can't actually find this bulb.

64
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,675
Scott: So you go like the specialty bulb store in the city I could.

65
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:50,763
Rym: there's one in Chinatown that I don't know if it's still there But I think I'm just gonna like a Home Depot or that kind of place.

66
00:04:50,964 --> 00:04:52,270
Scott: I'm sure that's close enough.

67
00:04:52,450 --> 00:05:01,387
Rym: Yes, I'm gonna actually go to a place buy these light bulbs and I think I need six of them and the halogen ones They're like six bucks each.

68
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:08,184
Scott: so hey I'm just looking for regular but like bulbs that are bright, right?

69
00:05:08,244 --> 00:05:09,770
Scott: I think I might need maybe one more lamp.

70
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,610
Rym: Well, what do you want bright like a spotlight or bright?

71
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:18,197
Scott: I want to make my whole apartment white like, you know Bright when the Sun is not.

72
00:05:18,437 --> 00:05:21,590
Rym: so in terms of this room how much brighter do you want it to be than this room right?

73
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,578
Rym: Brighter how much brighter like twice as bright?

74
00:05:24,738 --> 00:05:26,624
Scott: Well, I see all these shadow areas.

75
00:05:26,684 --> 00:05:27,648
Rym: You don't want to see shadows.

76
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,955
Rym: Not really For your apartment.

77
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:30,698
Rym: I'll tell you straight up.

78
00:05:30,718 --> 00:05:38,106
Rym: You need three fill lights like three Torsia style or two Torsia and then one like accent spot to get rid of like.

79
00:05:38,187 --> 00:05:39,010
Scott: I already got two lamps.

80
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:41,986
Scott: I turned them on and it's still pretty dark because those are what CFLs?

81
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:44,938
Scott: no No, they're just LEDs, but what kind of LEDs?

82
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:48,090
Scott: just the normal kind the equivalent of a 60 watt regular light.

83
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:52,425
Rym: You need ones that go up to fill out bouncing off the ceiling in the walls.

84
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:52,967
Rym: Mm-hmm.

85
00:05:53,288 --> 00:05:53,950
Rym: That is the way to go.

86
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,529
Rym: That's why it's torsiers are the things that used to be used for that.

87
00:05:57,609 --> 00:06:01,946
Rym: now There are other ways but all those other ways are weird like that weird woodley one.

88
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:02,890
Rym: I was showing you on Amazon.

89
00:06:03,131 --> 00:06:05,100
Scott: Yeah, this one the ones I have are just normal.

90
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,210
Scott: they have you know a lampshade around the side.

91
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,035
Scott: Yeah, you can't have that.

92
00:06:08,055 --> 00:06:12,856
Rym: you're gonna have something like this like that weird LED thing just more And you need multiple of them.

93
00:06:12,876 --> 00:06:14,622
Rym: I mean look our living room.

94
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:16,630
Rym: I got that giant halogen the one that's super hot.

95
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:20,610
Rym: I would need three of those to actually light that room up fully.

96
00:06:21,152 --> 00:06:26,012
Scott: Maybe I'll get two and put one on either side of the TV and then move the lamp on the left of the TV to The back.

97
00:06:26,273 --> 00:06:29,530
Rym: that's actually not a bad idea because you see I have the big one by the TV in the front.

98
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,929
Rym: I got the two dim ones in the back and that kind of rounds out the room.

99
00:06:34,031 --> 00:06:35,898
Rym: Anyway, it's not light bulb nights.

100
00:06:36,058 --> 00:06:36,681
Rym: It's GeekNights.

101
00:06:36,701 --> 00:06:37,283
Rym: They got any news.

102
00:06:38,086 --> 00:06:38,788
Scott: I do have a news.

103
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:44,927
Scott: so All the card games that I played the digital card game Hearthstone right netrunner, right.

104
00:06:44,967 --> 00:06:50,650
Scott: the physical card game They're getting big changes are happening or rumored to be happening soon or are happening already.

105
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,935
Scott: They're rebalancing.

106
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,482
Scott: They're fixing the cards.

107
00:06:54,502 --> 00:06:57,256
Scott: There's a new guy in charge of netrunner Hearthstone.

108
00:06:57,276 --> 00:06:58,445
Scott: big changes going on.

109
00:06:58,465 --> 00:07:00,354
Scott: they just Nerf some cards.

110
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:05,590
Scott: today expansion got announced all kinds of action and card game layers the pirates changes the ladder.

111
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:18,025
Scott: That's right, but the most exciting thing that I've seen is Someone some dude in the Parliament of one of the best countries this feed Where the Swedish chef is a Brahma?

112
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:21,123
Scott: And so is the king the king of Lundquist.

113
00:07:21,143 --> 00:07:22,049
Scott: He's also from there.

114
00:07:23,995 --> 00:07:25,884
Scott: The guys in the Parliament of Sweden.

115
00:07:26,205 --> 00:07:34,290
Rym: so imagine Well in the Congress of the US, so just you know, this threat is already locked sure for reasons.

116
00:07:35,232 --> 00:07:45,648
Scott: Anyway, imagine someone in the Congress of the US going on to twitch play in Hearthstone and Talking politics at the same time.

117
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:56,767
Scott: now I know of a few congressman who I could imagine doing that maybe like Jared Polis from Colorado or something, but Most I'd say 99% would not do this.

118
00:07:56,847 --> 00:08:10,830
Scott: but in Sweden They have a guy who's doing that and he's gonna talk politics while playing Hearthstone And he wants to know about like how to promote eSports is a thing in Sweden And I know there's plenty of excellent Swedish eSports type people.

119
00:08:10,931 --> 00:08:13,989
Scott: It's pretty, you know, they got the counter-strike and they got plenty of good action there.

120
00:08:14,896 --> 00:08:19,538
Scott: so even though Not involved in Swedish politics.

121
00:08:19,578 --> 00:08:20,441
Scott: I don't really care.

122
00:08:20,461 --> 00:08:22,909
Scott: I kind of want to see this dude stream.

123
00:08:23,612 --> 00:08:29,455
Scott: So I wish you know, we could get some of that action going on here and I'm surprised It wasn't Iceland first.

124
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:31,301
Scott: you think Iceland would be doing this first.

125
00:08:31,623 --> 00:08:38,722
Rym: So the thread was full of Almost nothing, but hate speech and they locked the thread being like quote.

126
00:08:39,063 --> 00:08:41,549
Rym: the number of hateful comments in this thread is too damn high.

127
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:42,976
Rym: It's cool.

128
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:46,090
Rym: This guy is streaming, but I'm locking the thread due to people being idiots.

129
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:48,580
Scott: What kind of hate speech would someone have to say?

130
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:49,503
Rym: Let's see.

131
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:50,668
Scott: I'm not one example.

132
00:08:50,688 --> 00:08:51,130
Scott: I don't know.

133
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,457
Rym: I imagine it all got down.

134
00:08:52,517 --> 00:08:53,503
Scott: It all got deleted.

135
00:08:54,146 --> 00:08:54,548
Rym: Let's see.

136
00:08:55,592 --> 00:09:00,970
Rym: So already liberal in Sweden day means libertarian and there's an argument about that nonsense.

137
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:03,790
Scott: All right, I don't know anything about Swedish politics.

138
00:09:05,031 --> 00:09:07,598
Rym: So it looks like it's just libertarian arguments.

139
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,200
Scott: Mm-hmm.

140
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:10,607
Rym: It is everything else probably got downloaded.

141
00:09:10,868 --> 00:09:12,517
Scott: It is the internet I mean who.

142
00:09:12,598 --> 00:09:14,350
Scott: I don't even know what the politics of this guy are.

143
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:20,150
Scott: He could be a crazy conservative nut job for all I know but is still a politician in office playing Hearthstone.

144
00:09:20,653 --> 00:09:23,530
Rym: So I saw most of the comments here actually deleted.

145
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:28,509
Rym: So I'm pretty sure someone went and just like deleted whatever hateful stuff was in here.

146
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:32,669
Rym: So a long time ago, do you know when we kick-started this?

147
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:43,170
Scott: You remember without looking kickstarter was extremely new like brand new Like it must have been the first if not second year of kickstarters existence.

148
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:54,462
Scott: So I'm gonna say like we were definitely living in not beacon, all right Well, so it had to be 2010 2011. so I'll say this.

149
00:09:55,365 --> 00:09:56,910
Rym: I don't know when the kickstarters started.

150
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:04,962
Rym: I guess I could go look up when I backed it, but the Anticipated delivery dates was September of 2014.

151
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:09,339
Scott: Oh, so I was actually way too early on my no That's when it was anticipated to be delivered.

152
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,652
Scott: So that makes me feel like it was kickstart in 2013.

153
00:10:12,652 --> 00:10:16,210
Scott: Maybe I can't imagine they thought it would take more than a year even though they were wrong.

154
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:19,070
Rym: So, uh, I literally forgot this existed.

155
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:33,164
Scott: I didn't forget but I got it confused because other things along these lines were coming out true the whole time between 20 whatever and 2017. there were so many other things that I forgot that like.

156
00:10:33,545 --> 00:10:44,982
Scott: no, none of those are this but River City Ransom Underground, which is a legit and Like officially licensed real deal sequel to River City Ransom.

157
00:10:45,022 --> 00:10:54,970
Rym: It is both a spiritual successor and a successor Mm-hmm with the real team like they got the dude and I'm not gonna get into the history of these games.

158
00:10:55,191 --> 00:10:58,810
Scott: Actual people who made River City Ransom 1 also made this game.

159
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,934
Rym: Remember those Technos games?

160
00:10:59,954 --> 00:11:04,870
Scott: It's not some indie people making a clone even though I'm sure some of the people working on it were.

161
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:10,150
Scott: It wasn't just these people but the actual River City Ransom people worked on this River City Ransom sequel.

162
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:12,678
Rym: I was as a kid obsessed with Technos games.

163
00:11:12,778 --> 00:11:13,319
Rym: Authentic.

164
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:26,490
Rym: Because primarily I had some Technos games But because of Nintendo power and the earliest of the internet I would occasionally see pictures of Technos games that never came out of the only ones we had that I know of.

165
00:11:28,131 --> 00:11:31,523
Scott: Wasn't really Technos, but I mean there are games that said Technos.

166
00:11:31,543 --> 00:11:33,470
Scott: we're talking about the ones with the same kind of sprites.

167
00:11:33,555 --> 00:11:33,810
Rym: Oh, yeah.

168
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:39,058
Scott: So the do super dodgeball River City Ransom and I think wasn't crashing the boys right.

169
00:11:39,118 --> 00:11:39,959
Scott: crashing the boys though.

170
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:42,255
Scott: It's sportsy one Right.

171
00:11:42,275 --> 00:11:43,369
Rym: I remember crashing the boys.

172
00:11:43,892 --> 00:11:47,388
Rym: Anyway, I was I was kind of I rented that game a bunch, but I never actually bought it.

173
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:50,329
Scott: for some reason I've played that one the least of all the of all those.

174
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:55,284
Scott: Yeah, but there are many more than those three that were Famicom but not NES released.

175
00:11:55,445 --> 00:11:59,518
Rym: Yep, but it actually Came out and I got a steam code.

176
00:11:59,538 --> 00:12:01,745
Scott: I got a steam key in my email today.

177
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:04,053
Scott: I was like, whoa, okay Whoa, what's this?

178
00:12:04,455 --> 00:12:04,837
Rym: I guess I can.

179
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:07,427
Rym: I can log into Kickstarter and put a check next to got it.

180
00:12:07,748 --> 00:12:10,316
Rym: Yep The only.

181
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,510
Scott: I mean, I don't know if it's good or not We're gonna find out real soon because it's River City Ransom.

182
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:15,797
Scott: We can play co-op and then Rym.

183
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:18,070
Scott: I got to punch him first before he punches me.

184
00:12:18,592 --> 00:12:22,970
Rym: I just want to point out that when I play co-op River City Ransom with anyone, but you everything's fine.

185
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,879
Scott: Yeah, because you see it's me and you come a guy.

186
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,286
Scott: It's I got a punch sky.

187
00:12:26,306 --> 00:12:27,070
Scott: He looks like a bad guy.

188
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,370
Rym: So I think what it is is that you put yourself directly in front of my fist.

189
00:12:31,591 --> 00:12:32,374
Scott: I didn't shoot you.

190
00:12:32,414 --> 00:12:33,618
Rym: you want to run of my gun.

191
00:12:33,638 --> 00:12:35,305
Scott: You saw me shooting the guy.

192
00:12:35,325 --> 00:12:36,690
Rym: Why are you walking in front of my gun?

193
00:12:39,151 --> 00:12:40,178
Scott: Officer I didn't shoot him.

194
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:41,889
Scott: You saw walk in front of my gun, right?

195
00:12:42,853 --> 00:12:44,968
Scott: As I was pulling the trigger, you know, that's not on me.

196
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:50,250
Scott: But uh, I'm real glad this game came out because it takes me like no one else here walks in front of my gun.

197
00:12:52,432 --> 00:12:52,773
Scott: It takes

198
00:12:53,074 --> 00:13:08,948
Rym: a long time to make even a seemingly simple game and it looks like they put the Proper amount of effort into making this live up to the things that we liked about River City Ransom without Replicating the things that made River City Ransom suck because it was a Nintendo game from a long time ago

199
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:09,470
Scott: like grinding.

200
00:13:09,894 --> 00:13:10,560
Rym: Yeah, they're

201
00:13:10,842 --> 00:13:11,569
Scott: being way too short

202
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,358
Rym: Or way too long depending on what kind of person

203
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:19,296
Scott: you I saw a speedrun of River City Ransom is way short if you skip the night and

204
00:13:19,316 --> 00:13:22,348
Rym: if you know how to fight all the bosses and like how to make them all appear

205
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:29,256
Scott: and you don't spend your time like we do trying to buy a bunch of items and you just pretty much grab this the Fist and just go to the end.

206
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:30,582
Rym: Also, just don't die.

207
00:13:30,662 --> 00:13:31,747
Rym: So you always have a ton of money.

208
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:36,150
Scott: Yeah Oh, yeah, it's also good, but dying is like they pretty much just buy the stone fist and that's it.

209
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:36,893
Scott: You don't need anything.

210
00:13:36,974 --> 00:13:38,079
Rym: I always use dragon kick.

211
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,116
Scott: I always like to use acro circus cuz we Suck though.

212
00:13:42,237 --> 00:13:45,705
Scott: It does suck but we Best one was the one that was the point of playing.

213
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:50,164
Rym: if you're not gonna get a The one that lets you hold a weapon and do that with the weapon.

214
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:51,509
Scott: and I like to go get some sushi.

215
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,556
Scott: Yeah, I think it's a smile.

216
00:13:53,657 --> 00:13:56,727
Scott: I was a freeze and I like to get to see the butts getting the spot.

217
00:13:57,028 --> 00:13:57,690
Scott: some sauna.

218
00:13:58,692 --> 00:14:01,690
Scott: But it's like most people if you want to speedrun it you can just skip all that.

219
00:14:02,151 --> 00:14:03,676
Scott: Walk walk walk walk walk skip.

220
00:14:03,696 --> 00:14:04,358
Scott: all the bad guys.

221
00:14:04,498 --> 00:14:09,738
Scott: do only point you to punch the punch the bosses with the dragon the stone Fist and the game is over.

222
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:11,630
Rym: But yeah this game.

223
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:17,508
Rym: I'm gonna guess that it's gonna be great, but we're gonna find out.

224
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,372
Scott: who knows I don't know.

225
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:24,726
Scott: I've been burning my stuff like but hey, it's out and that's a lot more than you can say for other games No, which are not out.

226
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:33,080
Rym: but anyway things of the day.

227
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:42,147
Rym: This is a compilation video, but it's very important right now because it's a it's a good time and the hockey times Rangers are definitely going to win the Stanley Cup this year.

228
00:14:42,408 --> 00:14:43,170
Scott: What's wrong with you?

229
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:44,586
Scott: That's wrong.

230
00:14:44,831 --> 00:14:58,240
Rym: Red Wings Yeah, well The Red Wings might be ending one of them one of the more interesting streaks in modern NHL history and that they have not missed the playoffs in my entire.

231
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,049
Scott: They're making it sentient life.

232
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:00,974
Scott: Definitely gonna make it.

233
00:15:01,315 --> 00:15:01,878
Rym: there is a.

234
00:15:03,648 --> 00:15:06,024
Scott: There is a guarantee Guaranteed to make it.

235
00:15:06,485 --> 00:15:18,858
Rym: they actually seem to have a better shot of getting into the top three of their As opposed to getting a wildcard slot because the wildcard slots everywhere are nuts.

236
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:26,260
Rym: right now anyway, it's hockey season and One of the greatest things about hockey is the empty net goal.

237
00:15:26,923 --> 00:15:34,780
Rym: One of the best things about hockey is the own goal But one of the best best things about hockey is the empty net own goal.

238
00:15:35,582 --> 00:15:38,490
Rym: So to make that even further only's not there.

239
00:15:38,851 --> 00:15:42,260
Scott: you got an extra person on the ice more than the other team and you score.

240
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,794
Scott: I have the puck and you know, they can't defend all of you.

241
00:15:45,815 --> 00:15:47,100
Scott: It's not like they got past you.

242
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:53,300
Scott: There's someone who's open cuz you got an extra guy and somehow you put it in your own empty net.

243
00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:58,880
Rym: It's not like somebody snuck past and got it in like Crider seems to do shorthanded to other teams all the time lately.

244
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:04,036
Rym: But that and the thing is this isn't even just this video.

245
00:16:04,477 --> 00:16:05,300
Rym: It's not just oh.

246
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,590
Rym: They pulled their goalie in the last minute and then they messed up.

247
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,914
Rym: the most of these instances are from a very particular thing.

248
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:13,760
Rym: that happens in hockey where There's penalties, right?

249
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:20,748
Rym: so like if you hit someone in the face with your stick or like you stab them with the butt end of your stick or Like all the stuff you're not allowed to do can't do that.

250
00:16:20,969 --> 00:16:23,920
Rym: They will whistle and stop play and give a penalty.

251
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:35,292
Rym: However, if you are on the offensive meaning you're in the enemy team's zone and you have a chance to score and you possess The puck and the other team commits a penalty.

252
00:16:35,312 --> 00:16:37,420
Rym: They're not gonna ruin your opportunity.

253
00:16:38,002 --> 00:16:47,899
Rym: They'll put their hand up signaling that hey as soon as you lose possession of the puck We're gonna immediately stop play because there's a penalty on the other team.

254
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,266
Scott: So keep playing for now.

255
00:16:50,506 --> 00:16:57,860
Rym: so because you know that the other team cannot touch the puck without play stopping You immediately pull your goalie, right?

256
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,281
Scott: Why not?

257
00:16:58,301 --> 00:16:58,783
Scott: they can't.

258
00:16:59,004 --> 00:17:03,863
Scott: they can't take the puck from you and score because as soon as they touch the puck with their stick That's it.

259
00:17:03,943 --> 00:17:04,585
Scott: Play stops.

260
00:17:05,186 --> 00:17:09,180
Rym: almost every one of these own goals is in that situation, right?

261
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:13,096
Rym: These are tied games or games that teams were winning up to this point.

262
00:17:13,156 --> 00:17:21,142
Scott: in that situation It can only be an empty net own goal because it can't be a not own goal because if they touch it then it's the Play stops.

263
00:17:21,182 --> 00:17:21,443
Scott: you could.

264
00:17:21,644 --> 00:17:22,426
Scott: only way it could get in.

265
00:17:22,446 --> 00:17:23,791
Scott: your empty net is if you put it there.

266
00:17:24,012 --> 00:17:33,019
Rym: Yeah the I mean unless somehow When the referee dropped the puck no one touched it and it bounced and rolled all the way in.

267
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:41,220
Scott: Sure, I guess physically that is technically the referee is dropping the puck play is already stopped and the person is in the box.

268
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:44,700
Scott: Yep, so I can't have a face-off during a delayed penalty.

269
00:17:44,861 --> 00:17:54,599
Rym: This is kind of amazing to watch because there's one where a dude kind of back passes to change lines And the puck just starts like slowly rolling toward the goal and no one notices right away.

270
00:17:55,901 --> 00:17:56,503
Rym: It's good stuff.

271
00:17:57,426 --> 00:17:57,928
Rym: So what do you got?

272
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:10,740
Scott: Ah, so I was watching the usual, you know, kpop Performances of the week whatever and I'm just scrolling through and I see one that's labeled Hakuna Matata and I'm thinking oh man, this is pretty great.

273
00:18:11,021 --> 00:18:13,094
Scott: Someone I don't know who because it's written in Korean.

274
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:17,313
Scott: I don't read that shit Has performed a Lion King cover.

275
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,620
Scott: This is gonna be great.

276
00:18:18,701 --> 00:18:21,640
Scott: Let's see who it is and and see if they're any good at it.

277
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,307
Rym: That is what I assume this was.

278
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:30,494
Scott: so I click on it and out comes this Amazing, dude and his girl with cat ears and some other girl like whatever.

279
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:36,359
Scott: and I'm like, alright this is clearly not the Lion King and I've never seen these people forever.

280
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:38,024
Scott: and They have.

281
00:18:38,105 --> 00:18:39,413
Scott: their name is wall worry.

282
00:18:39,454 --> 00:18:41,122
Scott: That's the name of their group Right.

283
00:18:41,222 --> 00:18:44,337
Scott: I don't know all their names, but the dude his name is mr.

284
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:49,520
Scott: Boombox And the name of their song is Hakuna Matata.

285
00:18:49,821 --> 00:18:56,293
Scott: I guess if you make it one word and take the space out of the metal and put in all caps Then you're not gonna get sued by Disney.

286
00:18:56,313 --> 00:19:04,429
Scott: So whatever and this song and these people are Incredible, I mean is this dude like?

287
00:19:05,272 --> 00:19:11,640
Scott: it's like he's Captain Jack of Korea But also at the same time he's like beatbox champion.

288
00:19:11,961 --> 00:19:14,188
Scott: I heard that he like organized.

289
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:18,200
Scott: he won and now organizes the beatbox competitions over there.

290
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:24,900
Scott: This this is our kind of guy and he made this group to sing this amazing song and they're just sort of getting up.

291
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,144
Scott: They're like, we don't give a fuck.

292
00:19:26,184 --> 00:19:27,328
Scott: Let's have a great time.

293
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,160
Scott: And I think they've seen like three performances.

294
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:38,080
Scott: But in this performance the other ones that seemed like the whole audience was girls and shit like teenagers who wanted to see actual kpop.

295
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:43,860
Scott: There's that one girl though, and they're all silent but in this performance they seem to have a fan in the audience.

296
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:49,274
Scott: He's like on full pterodactyl mode And it's incredible even more incredible than the other ones.

297
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:49,958
Scott: the top comment.

298
00:19:49,978 --> 00:19:53,260
Rym: Oh my god Did any Wells hear someone in the audience scream, right?

299
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,450
Scott: Also the vibes I get from this are like full Eurovision.

300
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:05,700
Scott: obviously Eurovision doesn't include Eastern Asia where Korea is But maybe that's what the spirit of Eurovision is getting ready because Eurovision is way soon.

301
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,950
Scott: Yeah It's always in the spring and it's already March.

302
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:13,469
Scott: tomorrow when you're gonna be listening to this It's probably gonna be March where you are and

303
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:21,527
Rym: this at least reminds me of the older Eurovisions that I liked a lot because some of the newer ones have been a little too sentimental and serious And I'd rather get back to like

304
00:20:21,568 --> 00:20:31,151
Scott: now people the new ride the new Eurovisions Most people are doing like, you know, really powerful Ballads of And it's like I don't mind.

305
00:20:31,393 --> 00:20:38,637
Scott: sure if I don't want to hear that shit Bring me the crazy songs and the wackiness and the you know, crazy costumes and epic sex.

306
00:20:38,777 --> 00:20:39,840
Scott: Come on bring on the good stuff.

307
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,291
Rym: Yep, the like that.

308
00:20:41,311 --> 00:20:46,231
Rym: No one's watching Eurovision Forget that running camera dolly shot.

309
00:20:46,271 --> 00:20:48,659
Rym: They did of spinning around the dude.

310
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,147
Scott: If it's not epic sex, I don't want it.

311
00:20:51,348 --> 00:20:51,668
Scott: Yep.

312
00:20:51,689 --> 00:20:59,236
Scott: So I think they should send this wall aries, you know They should pretend to be like, you know, I don't know what country Bosnian or something.

313
00:20:59,276 --> 00:21:00,220
Scott: So they can sneak in.

314
00:21:02,781 --> 00:21:07,133
Rym: So in the meta moment the booklet book is Frank Herbert's dune dune.

315
00:21:07,153 --> 00:21:09,078
Rym: a cuz we never read it.

316
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:09,900

00:21:12,827 --> 00:21:13,572
Scott: find out about it.

319
00:21:13,652 --> 00:21:20,117
Rym: not John Carmack's doom Frank Herbert's doom, which I'm actually finishing the nude 2016 doom because I didn't actually beat it.

320
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:20,719
Scott: Oh, you didn't beat it.

321
00:21:21,121 --> 00:21:22,377
Scott: Yeah, I beat it under the end.

322
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:24,668
Rym: now I really like the rocket launcher.

323
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:25,954
Rym: That seems to be a minority opinion.

324
00:21:25,974 --> 00:21:31,875
Rym: I like the sniper You know, no, I have the assault rifle like max out headshots from a distance.

325
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:32,236
Scott: Yes.

326
00:21:32,598 --> 00:21:33,260
Scott: I also have done.

327
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:40,899
Rym: However, it is real stressful to like pick people off from a distance cuz it's do like stuff keeps moving next to you.

328
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,988
Scott: Yeah, it depends on your level of violence.

329
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:44,690
Rym: Yep.

330
00:21:44,811 --> 00:21:45,693
Scott: Is it ultra?

331
00:21:46,095 --> 00:21:46,476
Rym: Of course.

332
00:21:46,496 --> 00:21:47,078
Rym: Uh-huh.

333
00:21:47,198 --> 00:21:47,840
Rym: I'm not a baby.

334
00:21:48,062 --> 00:21:49,759
Rym: I played dunes dunes before.

335
00:21:51,545 --> 00:21:52,632
Rym: Actually, I'm thinking about live streaming.

336
00:21:52,693 --> 00:21:53,659
Rym: it's been a long time, right?

337
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:59,302
Rym: I'm thinking about just start up doom 2 and just trying to play it on a live stream and see how far I get before I give up.

338
00:22:00,006 --> 00:22:01,433
Rym: cuz it's been a long time.

00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:02,297
Scott: I live stream.

340
00:22:02,317 --> 00:22:05,290
Scott: the other day I played Zelda 1 because I was testing out.

341
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,837
Scott: I set up a new live stream setup.

342
00:22:06,897 --> 00:22:07,560
Scott: It is so spice.

343
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,466
Scott: I don't think there's anything wrong with it whatsoever.

344
00:22:09,506 --> 00:22:10,409
Scott: It's so good, right?

345
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:18,734
Scott: Because I'm gonna stream the switch when I get it Next Friday this Friday, isn't it this Friday?

346
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:19,800

00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:24,416
Rym: That's gotta be so soon.

350
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,646
Scott: It's a show from Amazon.

351
00:22:26,686 --> 00:22:32,863
Scott: I'm gonna stream Zelda right away, but to get ready I stream the oldest Zelda Zelda 1 and I don't know why.

352
00:22:32,944 --> 00:22:37,600
Scott: I remember that entire fucking first quest and I can't remember like the name of a character in a book.

353
00:22:39,982 --> 00:22:43,988
Scott: But I sat down to play and stream it and two hours later I fucking beat it.

354
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:55,236
Scott: Whoa, nice I was just like I died a few times and I was careless and I was you know I mean like I was messing with the stream while Octoroks were shooting me like that, but his robes get you sometimes Yeah, the great one boot.

355
00:22:55,296 --> 00:22:59,820
Scott: one time I died this blue wizrobe came up on me and he's just like magic spell magic spell magic spell.

356
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,342
Rym: He did like.

357
00:23:00,442 --> 00:23:05,984
Scott: I only had the white ring at that point the ring and he did like six hearts of damage and I'm like Oh, fuck me.

358
00:23:06,004 --> 00:23:07,758
Rym: Yeah, there's nothing to do about that.

359
00:23:08,301 --> 00:23:13,280
Scott: Yes, if I would have just turned to the right I could have blocked them all with a magic shield, but whatever.

360
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,596
Rym: No, you didn't get a like like to eat it.

361
00:23:14,656 --> 00:23:14,940
Rym: You're good.

362
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:21,335
Scott: actually I almost got it eaten by like likes Many many many times and managed to escape.

363
00:23:21,355 --> 00:23:23,505
Scott: like every time I'm like, oh well That's the end of my shield.

364
00:23:23,807 --> 00:23:25,737
Scott: and somehow I escaped and still had the shield.

365
00:23:25,778 --> 00:23:27,988
Rym: as a kid You'd always be like, how could the light?

366
00:23:28,028 --> 00:23:31,523
Rym: how could you possibly get hit by the like like like it's so slow I'm gonna get you.

367
00:23:31,623 --> 00:23:34,995
Scott: I managed to it because if you look I pointed this out when I was streaming.

368
00:23:35,015 --> 00:23:36,903
Scott: they designed the rooms in Such a way.

369
00:23:37,385 --> 00:23:40,600
Scott: the room with the like like also has the sword stopping guy.

370
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,526
Scott: So he stops your sword.

371
00:23:42,626 --> 00:23:50,400
Scott: then you get like liked and you can't stab your way out and then when it gets really hard they Put like like sword stopping guy and whiz robe all in the same room.

372
00:23:50,641 --> 00:23:52,629
Scott: You need the shield to block the whiz robe.

373
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:54,275
Scott: the guy takes away your sword.

374
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:55,379
Scott: you get like liked.

375
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:57,554
Scott: now You don't have a shield and now whiz robes on your case.

376
00:23:57,634 --> 00:23:59,726
Scott: Yeah That's how they do.

377
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,860
Rym: I feel like maybe this would be a thing with the new streaming rigs.

378
00:24:02,921 --> 00:24:06,198
Rym: We should start playing old games Like I'll just stream bionic command all the way through till I beat it.

379
00:24:06,743 --> 00:24:08,679
Scott: I said, you know, you should go play bionic man.

380
00:24:09,423 --> 00:24:11,572
Rym: Maybe I'll do the new rear or the old rear armed again.

381
00:24:11,673 --> 00:24:13,139
Rym: cuz I think it was real good like.

382
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,616
Rym: Actually in retrospect like I would never get tired of that game.

383
00:24:16,898 --> 00:24:18,886
Rym: Yeah Not the sequel though.

384
00:24:18,906 --> 00:24:22,280

00:24:55,341 --> 00:24:56,305

Scott: Is there a New York City PC place?

424
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:34,350
Scott: Otherwise,

Rym: I've been putting I'm still doing this all our board game reviews separated out as just their own things without all the like dick talk and stuff that happens before and after them and There's a giant playlist these on YouTube and I'm trying to put one up every day until Every board game review we've ever done is out on YouTube and a lot of people are watching these things.

426
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,516
Rym: So spread the love spread them around.

427
00:26:57,641 --> 00:26:59,146
Rym: Also, is that it?

428
00:26:59,408 --> 00:26:59,970
Rym: I think that's it.

429
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,620
Scott: and downtown flushing there's a place called Evo gaming.

430
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:07,867
Scott: I don't know if it's related to the fighting game championship Play, you know tournament, but I've heard of that place.

431
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,716
Scott: It's got 17 5 star reviews on Yelp.

432
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,140
Rym: Oh And I learned something interesting.

433
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:19,162
Rym: So two of the things I haven't uploaded yet is I got a review of spot it and our review of that shitty trigger game That they made.

434
00:27:19,182 --> 00:27:19,663
Rym: Mm-hmm.

435
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:25,040
Rym: We did those reviews exactly one year apart on the same day effectively.

436
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:28,631
Rym: So we reviewed spot it because we found it the next year.

437
00:27:29,052 --> 00:27:33,909
Rym: we reviewed the next and last game We bought from that company because that company only made one good game.

438
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:34,913
Rym: That game was called spot it.

439
00:27:34,933 --> 00:27:35,274
Rym: Mm-hmm.

00:27:36,077 --> 00:27:38,384
Rym: So, uh See you guys at PAX.

441
00:27:38,765 --> 00:27:48,812
Rym: Maybe I'll see someone in London and now we're gonna talk about the princes of Florence Which is not traders of Genoa, but it's pretty much even odds.

442
00:27:49,093 --> 00:27:55,820
Rym: if you bring up either one of those games in my presence I'll assume you're talking about the other one until I see the game and remember right?

443
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,730
Scott: So traders of Genoa is the game where you can trade anything for anything.

444
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,360
Scott: Yep, princes of Florence is actually just normal euro game.

445
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,945
Scott: Yep, well not a lot of trading.

446
00:28:03,045 --> 00:28:05,954
Rym: It's a normal like older euro game.

447
00:28:06,035 --> 00:28:07,740
Rym: Yeah, cuz it's not real euro game.

448
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:15,480
Rym: It's not a cube pushing game No, like El Grande, which is even older, but it's also not one of the more modern like crank the machine games.

449
00:28:16,142 --> 00:28:21,118
Rym: It's one of those like really tight euro II like multiple paths to victory.

450
00:28:21,219 --> 00:28:22,764
Scott: every turn You get a couple actions.

451
00:28:22,804 --> 00:28:26,860
Rym: There's like bidding and stuff have a really restrictive bidding system of some kind.

452
00:28:27,101 --> 00:28:28,088
Scott: Yeah, well you go.

453
00:28:28,108 --> 00:28:28,511
Scott: I think it's more.

454
00:28:28,632 --> 00:28:29,840
Scott: it's like a power grid kind of thing, right?

455
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,679
Scott: We go around right like one, two, three.

456
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,318
Rym: Yeah, but it's it's a. it's not power grid in that the bidding is fixed.

457
00:28:35,781 --> 00:28:38,760
Rym: You started 200 you go up in 100 increments, right?

458
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,442
Rym: But yeah Prince.

459
00:28:39,462 --> 00:28:41,431
Rym: so the princes of Florence is a game from 2000.

460
00:28:41,431 --> 00:28:44,443
Rym: So it's 16 years old But it's on.

461
00:28:44,884 --> 00:28:56,158
Rym: it's a Kramer and all rich game, which you may remember from El Grande, which Really holds up as I'm starting to realize as I see people talking about it and playing it again in the modern era.

462
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:56,439
Rym: Mm-hmm.

463
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:03,740
Rym: So, uh, this game is from the line of games that were some of our earliest German euro style.

464
00:29:03,893 --> 00:29:10,240
Scott: Yeah I'm not sure what these games had to do with each other other than that They all came in the same box and had numbers on them and look like the Elia.

465
00:29:10,442 --> 00:29:16,299
Scott: It was the big box game Alia big box like Puerto Rico and a bunch of games all come in the same looking box.

466
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:17,748
Rym: You'd see these all lined up.

467
00:29:17,788 --> 00:29:18,874
Rym: a game company like it.

468
00:29:18,914 --> 00:29:19,920
Rym: like you've got a millennium games.

469
00:29:20,122 --> 00:29:24,348
Rym: Well, there's one with the mammoths on it Burgundy's actually in that list.

470
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:25,112
Scott: I don't know about the.

471
00:29:25,153 --> 00:29:27,825
Scott: maybe I don't know but There's others.

472
00:29:27,845 --> 00:29:29,980
Rym: there's also the small box, right?

473
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,165
Scott: But basically all these games can't.

474
00:29:31,206 --> 00:29:34,020
Scott: castles of burgundy all these games come in the same looking box.

475
00:29:34,821 --> 00:29:36,500
Scott: They're the same style Germany.

476
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:41,480
Rym: They're all numbered but you'll know them in the US because a lot of them were brought out by Rio Grande in the US.

477
00:29:41,681 --> 00:29:42,866
Rym: Right and you got the numbers.

478
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:44,132
Scott: you can tell by looking at.

479
00:29:44,153 --> 00:29:45,720
Scott: you're supposed to line them up on your bookshelf.

480
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,585
Scott: But what these games have to do with each other?

481
00:29:48,027 --> 00:29:51,477
Scott: other than that, they are similarly complex zero games.

482
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:52,219
Scott: I don't know.

483
00:29:52,702 --> 00:29:54,519
Scott: Yeah, like they're not made by the same people.

484
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:59,420
Rym: What's interesting though is many of them but not all of them and also I have not played all of them.

485
00:29:59,861 --> 00:30:02,533
Rym: Some of them have never as far as I know been released in the US.

486
00:30:02,955 --> 00:30:04,160
Scott: not all of them are equally good.

487
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:07,140
Scott: It's not something they range from bad to Puerto Rico.

488
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:15,039
Rym: So but all these like Kramer and all rich games and all these bit like there's there's all these games in this that I all associate together.

489
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:23,879
Rym: But part of that was that when I got into gaming a lot of these games were in game stores And there were the games that I was playing because other people are playing them.

490
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:25,668
Scott: Yeah, even in the early 2000s.

491
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:27,054
Scott: This was out in the u.s.

492
00:30:27,074 --> 00:30:28,320
Scott: Did he do what to call?

493
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,654
Rym: Because that was a series of games that weren't I don't think Wolfgang Kramer made to come.

494
00:30:33,714 --> 00:30:34,457
Scott: Yeah, did he?

495
00:30:34,617 --> 00:30:35,340
Rym: Yeah, he totally did.

496
00:30:35,581 --> 00:30:36,845
Rym: Okay, he did to call.

497
00:30:36,865 --> 00:30:41,620
Rym: in those other games that were the set of three Maya to call and Java.

498
00:30:42,682 --> 00:30:49,250
Rym: Make those all the mask trilogy, okay and Mexico Java to call right.

499
00:30:49,271 --> 00:30:50,979
Scott: Did he make Java and Mexico also?

500
00:30:54,282 --> 00:30:56,128
Rym: That's just a picture anyway, whatever.

501
00:30:56,469 --> 00:30:57,874
Scott: so Prince of Florence.

502
00:30:57,894 --> 00:31:03,059
Rym: so in this game the idea alternate names the increasingly inaccurately named mask trilogy.

503
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:06,007
Scott: So the you got.

504
00:31:06,027 --> 00:31:09,900
Scott: you're all princes in Florence, right and you have domains.

505
00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:12,009
Scott: Right, you know you got little.

506
00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:14,220
Scott: I guess what would you call my house?

507
00:31:14,743 --> 00:31:20,149
Scott: Yeah, you got houses the place where you live your estate, right and There's awesome people in Florence.

508
00:31:20,189 --> 00:31:22,440
Scott: cuz hell it's fucking Florence, right?

509
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:31,829
Scott: And you want to attract these awesome people to come and live in residence on your estate Because then you'll be more awesome than them other princes like Rym.

510
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,032
Scott: Yeah, right.

511
00:31:33,453 --> 00:31:43,390
Scott: So pretty much whoever gets the most People living with them right is the winner and that's all the game is.

512
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:52,280
Scott: so all you do on your turn is you Basically can choose certain actions to try to improve your estate.

513
00:31:52,441 --> 00:31:55,160
Scott: For example, you can add new buildings to your estate, right?

514
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:00,380
Scott: Like if if I have a nice art studio then all the artists are gonna want to come and stay with me, right?

515
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,651
Scott: Well Rym with his shabby estate.

516
00:32:03,114 --> 00:32:04,080
Scott: Yeah, they don't want to go there.

517
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,347
Rym: Introduce a freedom to your people right.

518
00:32:07,408 --> 00:32:09,013
Scott: if the people who live in my estate, right?

519
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:10,517
Scott: Like it's it's feudalism.

520
00:32:10,577 --> 00:32:10,838
Scott: right.

521
00:32:10,918 --> 00:32:12,724
Scott: effectively It's not feudalism.

522
00:32:13,005 --> 00:32:13,667
Scott: It's feudalism.

523
00:32:13,747 --> 00:32:15,372
Rym: It's not feudalism.

524
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,820
Scott: I give my people who live on my estate.

525
00:32:19,608 --> 00:32:20,231
Scott: I'm a prince.

526
00:32:20,251 --> 00:32:22,000
Scott: I'm basically the king, right?

527
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,559
Scott: There isn't a king telling me what to do and people on my estate follow my rules And if I don't give them freedom of speech, they got to shut the fuck up.

528
00:32:29,162 --> 00:32:40,640
Scott: But if I decide you know what I want to give the people who live on my estate freedom of speech unlike that heathen Fascist Rym estate when everyone has to shut up all the time People are gonna want to come and stay on my estate, aren't they?

529
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,140
Scott: I think they are because it's a nicer estate than rims estate.

530
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:50,639
Scott: So basically you got to alternate between improving your estate and then actually getting people to live there.

531
00:32:51,581 --> 00:32:54,012
Rym: Now the actual game like what you actually do.

532
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:55,539
Rym: if you ignore the conceit of the game.

533
00:32:56,581 --> 00:33:09,900
Rym: That's one area where a lot of the games that are kind of similar and that it's a bunch of Semi unique or very constraining mechanics kind of all cobbled together into a system Mm-hmm, and you're just trying to navigate through the system alongside everyone else.

534
00:33:10,141 --> 00:33:13,011
Rym: It's it's sort of like solitaire except that you interact.

535
00:33:13,453 --> 00:33:25,187
Rym: one because you are acquiring Highly limited resources and two the primary way you get the most limited resources is through a very restrictive auction Mm-hmm.

536
00:33:25,207 --> 00:33:27,600
Rym: So basically on your turn you'll there be an auction.

537
00:33:28,061 --> 00:33:34,040
Rym: So so you put something up for auction for like 200 flooring and then you just go clockwise around the table.

538
00:33:34,441 --> 00:33:38,356
Rym: You either pass forever or increase the bid by exactly 100 flooring.

539
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:42,294
Rym: So the things that you auction off there's only so many turns.

540
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,640
Rym: you do not play this game.

541
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,868
Rym: You play like seven turns and then it's over.

542
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:52,948
Rym: So basically you're going to win seven auctions and Take fourteen actions two actions per turn.

543
00:33:52,969 --> 00:33:53,350
Rym: That's it.

544
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:58,870
Scott: That's the whole game and you got to play, you know You're only only once per turn.

545
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:01,480
Scott: Can you actually get a person to move into your place?

546
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,570
Scott: So if you want to win I won.

547
00:34:05,012 --> 00:34:07,080
Scott: I had six guys move into my place.

548
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:13,257
Scott: So on the seven turns available in the game six of them I was able to score a dude and have him move into my estate.

549
00:34:13,297 --> 00:34:19,770
Rym: you could theoretically make two But I don't know if I've ever seen anyone do it.

550
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:22,540
Scott: I did one a turn except for I think the second turn.

551
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,565
Rym: Yeah, there's definitely a turn.

552
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:26,480
Scott: I did not do one and so did the person who came in second place.

553
00:34:26,621 --> 00:34:28,599
Scott: Yeah, everyone else did five or fewer.

554
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:34,940
Rym: So the game is good in that there aren't really other games like it and it is interesting.

555
00:34:35,442 --> 00:34:44,833
Rym: but there seems to be a big point of contention among players as to whether or not the five player very playing the game with Five players is the best option as opposed to four.

556
00:34:45,395 --> 00:34:46,719
Scott: This definitely is one of those games.

557
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:57,660
Scott: It's very different with different numbers of players because it has the old game Problem of they did not scale up the numbers of things a lot as players numbers changes.

558
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:03,340
Scott: Yeah, so as you have more players resources become more scarce and it changes the game drastically.

559
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:06,113
Rym: Well, like three player four player five player Puerto Rico.

560
00:35:06,474 --> 00:35:07,580
Scott: completely different game, right?

561
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:16,762
Scott: But compared to say power grid where when you have more players and power grid you put up more starting resources So they don't run out and you use bigger maps that you don't fight it You know, you're.

562
00:35:16,902 --> 00:35:21,089
Scott: equally you have as much fighting over space no matter how many players there are Yep.

563
00:35:21,521 --> 00:35:28,280
Rym: So with a five player game the dudes to make the things which is like the primary point economy of the game.

564
00:35:29,164 --> 00:35:32,280
Rym: There are not that many of them and you need them, right?

565
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:40,260
Scott: You might make an awesome estate But if you can't actually get the guys Cards of dudes in your hand you you know enough.

566
00:35:40,481 --> 00:35:45,769
Scott: I actually had to fight very hard at the end of the game to get one more card So I could actually score.

567
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:47,259
Scott: I have a final dude to score.

568
00:35:47,572 --> 00:35:48,463
Scott: Yeah When

569
00:35:48,483 --> 00:36:04,332
Rym: we played at PAX what we saw is that the cards that were available were all taken up basically immediately And then as a result, the only way you could ever get another person outside of what was already in your hand Was - there's a card that lets you basically Take a guy that was already played by someone else instead

570
00:36:04,433 --> 00:36:06,300
Scott: and convince him to come to your estate and leave.

571
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:11,080
Scott: So I convinced the guy to leave rims estate and come to my estate instead to score him Even though you'd already been scored.

572
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:19,935
Rym: So when you score the guys and this is actually a very interesting mechanic when you get these guys Basically, they have sort of requirements or not really a requirement.

573
00:36:19,955 --> 00:36:21,480
Scott: They got preferences, right?

574
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,340
Scott: The art, you know if a guy has a certain job He likes a certain kind of estate, right?

575
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,020
Scott: If you have an artist studio the guy who's like a philosopher doesn't give a fuck.

576
00:36:29,422 --> 00:36:30,648
Scott: He's like what use is that to me?

577
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,718
Scott: But if you got a library, he's like, oh, baby.

578
00:36:32,738 --> 00:36:34,364
Scott: Yep I like that estate.

579
00:36:34,485 --> 00:36:36,954
Rym: bigger buildings have more people who like them.

580
00:36:37,035 --> 00:36:38,380
Rym: So they're like the tiny building.

581
00:36:38,582 --> 00:36:40,300
Rym: It's only one dude who cares about that place.

582
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,471
Scott: yeah, if you get like the observatory only the astronomer gives a shit.

583
00:36:43,853 --> 00:36:52,960
Rym: everyone else is like, I don't care if you're having a Frickin telescope, but all these other things like landscapes and gestures and all this stuff They like add more points to this.

584
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,380
Rym: So basically when you take a dude, right?

585
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:59,829
Scott: So it's like if I could go to that place as a library, but this place is a library But it also has three gestures.

586
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:02,000
Scott: It's like whoa, that place is way more fun.

587
00:37:02,121 --> 00:37:04,299
Scott: I definitely want to go there and everyone loves gestures.

588
00:37:04,942 --> 00:37:16,080
Rym: when you take a dude you basically add up all those factors and you get a number of how valuable that work was and Every turn there's a minimum value that even counts.

589
00:37:16,422 --> 00:37:19,520
Rym: You can't even do it unless you get at least to the minimum, right?

590
00:37:20,924 --> 00:37:24,573
Scott: People get more and more demanding as the quality of estates increases.

591
00:37:24,954 --> 00:37:27,160
Scott: people are like, you know, they got higher standards, right?

592
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,506
Scott: It's like at the beginning of the game.

593
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:29,833
Scott: All the estates are basically empty.

594
00:37:29,913 --> 00:37:31,340
Scott: So it's like I'll move in anywhere.

595
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:37,905
Rym: There's a fucking bed and you bring it and you bring that in and he scribbles like on a piece of paper and everyone in Towns like oh my god, that's amazing.

596
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,069
Rym: Right but seven turns later.

597
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:41,940
Rym: They're like what I've already seen the Mona Lisa, right?

598
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:42,724
Rym: Yeah for me.

599
00:37:42,805 --> 00:37:44,215
Scott: Yeah towards the end of the game.

600
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:50,020
Scott: It's like You know if you want me to live in your estate and you know make you some works or whatever.

601
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:53,308
Scott: I mean you better have like fucking.

602
00:37:53,548 --> 00:37:57,540
Scott: you know people made of gold licking my junk cuz that's what I got now.

603
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:12,598
Rym: So, you know Yep, so when you complete the work and everyone might complete their works on the turn you get a bonus for making the highest value work, but you pretty much just got a complete one because that is the primary way to get money and victory points.

604
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:24,240
Rym: and Basically when you complete the work when you do the thing and get the person you choose How much of that you want to turn into victory points and how much of that you want to turn into money?

605
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,815
Scott: To basically continue playing the game and this is the most interesting decision in the game.

606
00:38:28,895 --> 00:38:30,320
Rym: It is not an easy decision.

607
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:35,600
Rym: No, it's like you score a guy by like 100 floor in more than once right?

608
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:42,980
Scott: It's like you think okay early in the game You take the coins and late in the game you take just take all victory points and that's not a bad way to go.

609
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,505
Scott: That's the way it works in most games.

610
00:38:45,087 --> 00:38:47,776
Scott: But on the second to last turn of the game.

611
00:38:47,876 --> 00:38:52,480
Scott: I realized aha Next turn I need to score another dude or else I'm not gonna win.

612
00:38:52,681 --> 00:38:57,680
Scott: Yep, if I want to score another dude, I need to win this auction to buy that dude to score.

613
00:38:57,901 --> 00:39:01,320
Scott: Otherwise, I'm gonna basically score zero points in the final turn for nothing.

614
00:39:01,801 --> 00:39:07,260
Scott: So even though I could score this guy for full victory points, that's not enough points to win.

615
00:39:07,963 --> 00:39:15,340
Scott: But if I score him now for zero points and take all money and I use all that money and get a guy next turn I win like the important.

616
00:39:15,501 --> 00:39:19,300
Scott: Oh, no, that's still not enough points to win because I scored zero points this turn.

617
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:33,053
Scott: I got to somehow get enough points this turn but as much money as possible So that I have enough points to basically make it so no one can beat me But also have enough money so I can win the auction next turn no matter what.

618
00:39:33,374 --> 00:39:39,480
Rym: now independent of that Pretty much everything you do gets you some points at the end of the game.

619
00:39:40,122 --> 00:39:46,560
Rym: And there's all these like sub games that are kind of solitary that you just play right like jesters get you points and buildings get you.

620
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:51,407
Rym: There's all these things that like add value to the works that you get with the people.

621
00:39:51,868 --> 00:40:02,250
Rym: but there's also things like When you get buildings or these landscape things you put them on your board and you got to play Tetris and there's rules like you Can't build buildings next to other buildings

622
00:40:02,551 --> 00:40:04,140
Scott: unless your builder gets really good

623
00:40:04,241 --> 00:40:10,173
Rym: And you want to have the least empty space at the end of the game Because you have bonus points for that and if you need a building, but it won't fit.

624
00:40:10,233 --> 00:40:15,700
Rym: Well, fuck you that sucks Yep, and on top of all that you have set collection.

625
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:22,740
Rym: So like if you get enough builders or you get enough forests or whatever, you know all these extra victory points.

626
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,839
Rym: So there's a lot of ways to get victory points at the end of the game.

627
00:40:26,623 --> 00:40:26,905
Rym: so it's.

628
00:40:26,945 --> 00:40:32,770
Rym: you know, a lot of these games in this era had that concept of Everything is worth victory points in some direct way.

629
00:40:33,211 --> 00:40:35,800
Rym: And then there's a machine that also cranks out victory points.

630
00:40:36,082 --> 00:40:42,231
Rym: so you got to optimize the like Placement getting of things while also optimizing the machine.

631
00:40:42,532 --> 00:40:47,720
Rym: the machine tends to be more reliant upon the actions of the other players While the rest of it tends to be more solitary, right?

632
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:58,600
Scott: the machine is definitely the most powerful way to get the victory points like if you win that you win because if you win it Other people aren't getting points because that's the competitive part, but you have to keep up in the solitaire part.

633
00:40:59,022 --> 00:41:01,240
Scott: Otherwise, it won't be enough points to win.

634
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:01,823
Scott: But it's all.

635
00:41:01,863 --> 00:41:06,458
Scott: you just keep up in the solitaire and win the machine game Then you're gonna win the whole game.

636
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:11,816
Rym: So I'm not sure if I believe the five-player version of this game is the best or not.

637
00:41:12,297 --> 00:41:14,680
Scott: I think the problem with It's tough, right?

638
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:25,020
Rym: it's so tight and so locked in on the cards that a Problem is that unless you've played the game enough to just know like which guys need what and kind of a sense of what?

639
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:36,028
Rym: You have a little bit of analysis problems And you have to literally look at the list of all the people and all the things those people want and look at everyone else's Boards and you can do a lot of calculation.

640
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:37,837
Scott: It took me a lot of time, but I won right.

641
00:41:38,805 --> 00:41:39,979
Scott: I did do a bit of analysis.

642
00:41:40,301 --> 00:41:41,244
Scott: I took like I took.

643
00:41:41,445 --> 00:41:44,215
Scott: I took a few minutes to figure out which what exactly what.

644
00:41:44,295 --> 00:41:48,013
Rym: I was willing to do that and I went Up and got a hot dog instead and as a result.

645
00:41:48,033 --> 00:41:49,220
Rym: I had a really bad.

646
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:56,340
Scott: I only did it once at like the very end of the game because my plan was slightly Disrupted that I had originally come up with because someone else did something.

647
00:41:56,382 --> 00:42:01,861
Scott: Yeah So I basically had to spend an extra like two minutes figuring out what the hell was going I was gonna do and it and it Did it.

648
00:42:02,203 --> 00:42:04,919
Rym: so the problem I had to was that in the last turn?

649
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:11,362
Rym: I think there were two players in our five-player game who had literally nothing they could do in the last turn to get points enough To matter.

650
00:42:11,382 --> 00:42:22,540
Rym: Yep, and a third player may or may not have been able to affect the game But it really didn't matter because it depended upon what the fourth and fifth players did Because the resources had basically run out on that fifth turn.

651
00:42:22,644 --> 00:42:26,134
Scott: So, you know You could only do something if you were large and in charge in the fifth turn.

652
00:42:26,155 --> 00:42:35,321
Scott: if you played with less players there would still be a bunch of unclaimed resources at that point and It wouldn't be so tight that you know You could.

653
00:42:35,582 --> 00:42:41,280
Rym: anyone would still be in it basically but at the same time the tightness adds a ridiculous amount of tension.

654
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:46,967
Scott: Yeah without the game going on as long as some of those super tense train like you want games to be tight You don't want to be too tight.

655
00:42:47,008 --> 00:42:50,828
Scott: For example, we did potion explosion We talked about recently and a potion explosion.

656
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:55,830
Scott: You can only score two potions a turn and if you fall behind You don't score two every turn.

657
00:42:55,891 --> 00:43:08,320
Scott: Well, right but in In Princess of Florence, it's like well you want to score one dude on almost every turn and if you fall behind Yeah, and you can't really score more than one and that's sort of like but it sucks.

658
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:11,152
Scott: Sometimes you can't even get a guy cuz they ran out.

659
00:43:11,393 --> 00:43:12,900
Scott: Yeah, and that's that's why I had to win that.

660
00:43:14,321 --> 00:43:16,287
Rym: What's interesting though is the game is only seven turns.

661
00:43:16,608 --> 00:43:27,064
Rym: so I enjoy the like severe restrictions and tightness of this game Even though I hate the same thing in Food chain magnate.

662
00:43:27,626 --> 00:43:29,009
Scott: Well, I think it's because even though

663
00:43:29,029 --> 00:43:44,918
Rym: chain magnate is a lot longer and the paths are so narrow And they don't touch each other at all this game every path has a lot of victory points and a lot of ways to Really look at what other people are doing and it matters a lot.

664
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,740
Scott: Well, the game just has lots of decisions to make that are really interesting.

665
00:43:48,901 --> 00:43:49,845
Scott: Like do I?

666
00:43:50,167 --> 00:43:52,660
Scott: how do I split this between victory points and money?

667
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:53,361
Scott: Which?

668
00:43:53,562 --> 00:43:56,400
Scott: I want to buy that building because that lets me make this guy.

669
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:01,700
Scott: He'll he'll be attracted to my estate, but the building doesn't really fit nicely in my area.

670
00:44:01,881 --> 00:44:07,028
Scott: So do I try to get a builder first, but if I get a builder first and it's a whole action I won't be able to get this freedom.

671
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:12,176
Scott: and if I die because I only have two actions If I don't get the freedom the guy won't be as happy.

672
00:44:12,196 --> 00:44:14,607
Rym: and I already have a builder.

673
00:44:14,868 --> 00:44:17,980
Rym: getting another one doesn't help me that much but I could just get victory points for that.

674
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:20,470
Rym: Right a bunch of builders is victory points.

675
00:44:20,551 --> 00:44:21,254
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

676
00:44:21,294 --> 00:44:25,918
Scott: there's a lot of decisions like that That are like, you know, and then once you make one you're locked in.

677
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:26,280
Scott: not you know?

678
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,105
Scott: You basically change.

679
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:28,252
Scott: you improved your board.

680
00:44:28,272 --> 00:44:29,480
Scott: for now the whole rest of the game.

681
00:44:29,922 --> 00:44:32,880
Scott: So it's like the buildings I chose early and like the early turns.

682
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:37,628
Scott: I didn't realize when I was buying those buildings that later in the game It's like oh I need the guys.

683
00:44:37,668 --> 00:44:42,271
Scott: that goes with those buildings so that I can get more Value out of that building purchase.

684
00:44:42,572 --> 00:44:52,220
Scott: if I have to buy a new building That you know if I had to get a different guy and to get a different building That's a whole extra action to buy another building and like a whole nother, right?

685
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:55,359
Scott: Whereas if I can be more efficient and use them over and over again.

686
00:44:55,881 --> 00:44:58,328
Scott: Then I'll get more value for my action.

687
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:00,815
Scott: because you're lit seven turns two actions a turn.

688
00:45:00,856 --> 00:45:02,220
Scott: was that 14 actions the end?

689
00:45:02,541 --> 00:45:06,335
Rym: Yeah, right 14 actions and seven auctions right that's all you got.

690
00:45:06,396 --> 00:45:11,175
Scott: so you better choose those 1421 things very very wisely.

691
00:45:11,235 --> 00:45:15,359
Rym: so we knew you know We're talking about the tense decisions the first auction of the game.

692
00:45:15,821 --> 00:45:24,833
Rym: We're all sitting there about to play this game and a bunch of us haven't played it before and even the literal first auction in The game was real tense and got her a real high number.

693
00:45:25,114 --> 00:45:26,640
Scott: Yes, like there's only gonna be seven of them.

694
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:27,064
Scott: Here you go.

695
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:27,529
Scott: First one.

696
00:45:27,549 --> 00:45:27,973
Scott: Let's go.

697
00:45:28,033 --> 00:45:41,320
Rym: It's like oh shit Yep, and because the the auctions are restricted It's not like auctions in other games where you can drive it up Strategically you because you really don't have a lot of choice.

698
00:45:41,481 --> 00:45:42,710
Rym: It's just the price will be X.

699
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:49,697
Scott: when it comes to you right in power grid There's like this three of them and you know, there's gonna be more and it's okay.

700
00:45:49,718 --> 00:45:53,393
Scott: Yeah in this one It's like alright, I'm picking jester and it's like well, that's the jester.

701
00:45:53,434 --> 00:45:54,599
Scott: That could be won this turn.

702
00:45:55,324 --> 00:45:57,460
Rym: Yep, if you don't get it be another jester.

703
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:04,000
Scott: If you don't win this auction for jester this turn you are at best getting a jester next turn which is a big difference.

704
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:08,100
Rym: Yep, because every turn things a lot of the things you get are effectively cumulative.

705
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:14,297
Rym: So getting a jester on turn one way more valuable than getting it on turn two and extra it's it's.

706
00:46:14,498 --> 00:46:21,199
Scott: it's significantly But not drastically more valuable than turn two But it's way more valuable than getting one on turn three.

707
00:46:21,781 --> 00:46:25,493
Scott: And you're playing with four or five people in a seven turn game.

708
00:46:25,934 --> 00:46:27,358
Scott: turn three is halfway through the game.

709
00:46:27,378 --> 00:46:29,892
Scott: basically No, it's like oh I got one at the start of the game.

710
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:32,772
Scott: when you go in halfway through good job That's like two less uses.

711
00:46:32,813 --> 00:46:33,498
Scott: you got out of it.

712
00:46:34,282 --> 00:46:39,560
Rym: So I feel like this is a style of euro that a lot of you may not have played.

713
00:46:40,541 --> 00:46:48,260
Scott: Yeah, cuz I feel like this is this I feel I think most people haven't been playing euro serious games as long as we have Even though we haven't been playing as long as like grognards.

714
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,150
Scott: We've only been playing since like thousand ish, right?

715
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:53,117
Rym: And this is probably got settlers in 2000, right?

716
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:54,968
Scott: So this came out in like 2000.

717
00:46:54,968 --> 00:46:58,797
Rym: So yeah So, uh, I don't I like it.

718
00:46:59,262 --> 00:47:01,320
Rym: I don't know if I want to own it cuz I'm trying to get rid of game.

719
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:08,980
Scott: I don't think I need to own this game, but it's like if I want to play then you should bring it to Another packs, right?

720
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:15,072
Scott: So if I want to play a for real euro game that I haven't already played a bunch I would play this a few more times watching us in the stream.

721
00:47:15,354 --> 00:47:15,916
Rym: He's pointing out.

722
00:47:16,157 --> 00:47:16,720
Rym: Yeah, he's right.

723
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:29,899
Rym: So yeah, cuz Kramer worked with keys ling on those other games and with all rich This stuff, okay Anyway, well to do there's two different all riches, but the third one is not always named.

724
00:47:29,979 --> 00:47:30,240
Rym: I don't know.

725
00:47:30,401 --> 00:47:32,089
Rym: I don't know why I never I don't.

726
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:34,300
Scott: I have not paid a lot of attention to these people.

727
00:47:34,401 --> 00:47:36,053
Rym: I don't know a lot about Richard all rich.

728
00:47:36,093 --> 00:47:40,346
Rym: to be perfectly honest I know Wolfgang Kranger because his name was on all the games.

729
00:47:40,406 --> 00:47:41,389
Rym: I played a long time ago.

730
00:47:41,409 --> 00:47:47,486
