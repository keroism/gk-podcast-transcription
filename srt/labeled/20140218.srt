1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,243
Rym: It's Tuesday, February 18th, 2014.

2
00:00:12,243 --> 00:00:14,670
Rym: I'm Rym, I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,410
Rym: Tonight, a bunch of jackasses trying to play Pokemon on Twitch.

4
00:00:20,492 --> 00:00:21,528
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,231 --> 00:00:28,570
Rym: Welcome to Action Pokemon.

6
00:00:29,451 --> 00:00:30,442
Scott: That's what it is.

7
00:00:30,623 --> 00:00:31,230
Rym: End game.

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,826
Scott: Let's not talk about it until we get to the bit so that we can...

9
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:39,230
Rym: So I have a tale of woe from the other night.

10
00:00:39,351 --> 00:00:42,990
Rym: It is one of the most woeful things that has happened to me in recent memory.

11
00:00:44,472 --> 00:00:45,360
Scott: So, I'm home.

12
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,350
Rym: I'm tired.

13
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,728
Rym: Going to bed early for the first time in, I don't know, like a year or two.

14
00:00:52,872 --> 00:00:54,923
Rym: It's like 10 o'clock and I'm like, "We're gonna go to bed.

15
00:00:55,285 --> 00:00:56,008
Rym: Fuck yeah, go to

16
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:56,290
Rym: bed.".

17
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,410
Rym: So we go into the bedroom, go to bed, fall asleep.

18
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:03,470
Rym: I'm gonna get more sleep that night than I've gotten most days of my life.

19
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:09,350
Rym: And then the rabbits start thumping and they wake us up, which isn't that uncommon.

20
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,010
Rym: Occasionally one will be in a bad mood or have a bad dream or something.

21
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,760
Rym: And a rabbit thump basically is a, "Hey, watch out.

22
00:01:17,483 --> 00:01:17,984
Rym: Something's up.

23
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:18,666
Rym: Something's bad.

24
00:01:19,047 --> 00:01:19,268
Rym: Watch

25
00:01:19,408 --> 00:01:19,489
Rym: out.".

26
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:21,988
Rym: And usually one of them will thump and the other one's like, "Shut up,

27
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:22,190
Rym: dude.".

28
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,349
Rym: But this time they were both thumping.

29
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:25,530
Rym: So we kind of wake up and we're laying there.

30
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,962
Rym: Then Emily says, "Rym, do you smell

31
00:01:28,444 --> 00:01:28,806
Rym: burning?".

32
00:01:30,293 --> 00:01:33,145
Rym: And first I think, "Of course there's nothing burning.

33
00:01:33,225 --> 00:01:33,989
Rym: Nothing smells like

34
00:01:34,029 --> 00:01:34,310
Rym: burning.".

35
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,886
Rym: And then I go, and I say, "Yep, I definitely smell

36
00:01:38,947 --> 00:01:39,308
Rym: burning.".

37
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:45,670
Rym: So we sit up and we turn on the light and we look around and it seems like it's coming from the heater.

38
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,218
Rym: But our heater is really dumb.

39
00:01:48,278 --> 00:01:50,810
Rym: It's just steam or the hot water piped through a thing.

40
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,949
Rym: There's nothing to burn in there.

41
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:55,650
Rym: And it seems like it's coming from the heater.

42
00:01:56,572 --> 00:02:00,330
Rym: So I open the window and I kind of smell it outside, but I'm not sure.

43
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,662
Rym: So I tell her to wait in the bedroom and poke around.

44
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:07,004
Rym: Because we have that dodgy lamp that your dad got us.

45
00:02:07,165 --> 00:02:08,130
Rym: One of them still remains.

46
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,149
Scott: Oh, I got rid of that.

47
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,378
Rym: That sparky, dodgy piece of shit.

48
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:14,110
Rym: I kind of expected that thing to be on fire inside or something.

49
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:22,630
Rym: So she's checking there and I walk out into the hallway and I come into this room, the studio, and I open the window and it kind of smells like burning, but I can't quite tell.

50
00:02:23,532 --> 00:02:27,550
Rym: So I'm looking around and then the burning smell starts getting worse and worse and worse.

51
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:32,190
Rym: So I turn on the light and there's just fucking smoke coming out of the ceiling.

52
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,130
Rym: There's like a foot of hazy smoke hanging around the ceiling, slowly descending.

53
00:02:38,053 --> 00:02:38,840
Rym: So I'm like, "Oh,

54
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:39,304
Rym: fuck.".

55
00:02:40,053 --> 00:02:40,790
Scott: What did you burn?

56
00:02:42,011 --> 00:02:43,341
Rym: So it's coming out of the ceiling.

57
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:44,490
Rym: There's nothing in our apartment.

58
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:47,369
Scott: Why would... Smoke usually goes up, not down.

59
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:48,904
Rym: Yeah, exactly.

60
00:02:49,672 --> 00:02:51,903
Scott: That's very strange when smoke comes out of the ceiling.

61
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,250
Scott: Usually it comes out of the floor.

62
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,650
Scott: Especially in a modern building, it doesn't come out of anything.

63
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,169
Rym: So I can explain after we get to the end why it was coming out of the ceiling, and that actually makes perfect sense.

64
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:01,950
Scott: Just air pressure weirdness?

65
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,110
Rym: So this is happening and we're in a fireproof building.

66
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:12,990
Rym: The general rule in fireproof buildings is that if there's a fire, unless the fire is in your apartment, you shelter in place.

67
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,390
Rym: You're supposed to just stay in your apartment.

68
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:21,890
Rym: So I open up all the windows to air the smoke out, because smoke inhalation is obviously the most dangerous part of a fire.

69
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:27,010
Rym: And Emily goes into the hallway and prepares to go downstairs to see what the deal is.

70
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:29,322
Rym: Are there fires elsewhere?

71
00:03:29,463 --> 00:03:30,610
Rym: Is there something going on?

72
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:31,790
Rym: She's going to do some recon.

73
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,869
Rym: And I'm getting all the shit together to get the rabbits and evacuate.

74
00:03:36,712 --> 00:03:38,590
Rym: So yeah, she comes back upstairs.

75
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:44,769
Rym: And to give a long story short, I went down and I witnessed the final conclusion of this.

76
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,990
Rym: The second floor had it way worse.

77
00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:49,710
Rym: The second floor was filled with smoke.

78
00:03:50,371 --> 00:03:51,570
Scott: Okay, the fire must have been.

79
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:54,810
Scott: So it was on the floor below you, but the smoke was coming out of the ceiling.

80
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,389
Scott: Was it going up into a vent and then down?

81
00:03:56,951 --> 00:04:00,929
Rym: So the fire was actually on the ground floor, where there was almost no smell of smoke.

82
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:06,570
Rym: So I go to the ground floor after Emily explained what happened, and I'm kind of figuring out the deal.

83
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:10,630
Rym: We have all the windows open and all the heaters blasting and just airing out our apartment.

84
00:04:11,912 --> 00:04:15,930
Rym: And what I encounter down there is a whole bunch of firemen with axes.

85
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,269
Rym: One of the axes had clearly been used.

86
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,928
Rym: There had actually been a fire, and they're standing around.

87
00:04:21,774 --> 00:04:22,769
Rym: And there's a young girl.

88
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:31,150
Rym: She looked like she was in her early 20s, and she's standing there on the verge of tears, desperately trying to explain that it's not my fault.

89
00:04:31,531 --> 00:04:32,670
Scott: I didn't put anything in.

90
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,456
Scott: Yes, you did.

91
00:04:34,303 --> 00:04:35,049
Scott: Clearly it's you.

92
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:35,734
Rym: Nothing.

93
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:36,790
Scott: Just let me go check.

94
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:38,202
Scott: I don't even know what happened.

95
00:04:38,262 --> 00:04:39,009
Scott: I know you did it.

96
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:40,039
Rym: See?

97
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:41,150
Rym: We were talking about this afterward.

98
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:47,729
Rym: There's a certain way that people younger than me and younger than you will try to shift blame away from themselves when they fuck up.

99
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,789
Rym: And this was a textbook case of that.

100
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:56,543
Rym: And meanwhile, the super and the doorman and the firemen are all standing around her with their arms crossed, just giving that look of, "Eh,

101
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:57,030
Rym: eh.".

102
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,730
Scott: I don't know what you did, but you did it.

103
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,647
Rym: There was that look that a dad gives, like, "Oh, your little brother just punched himself in the

104
00:05:02,788 --> 00:05:02,888
Rym: arm.".

105
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:03,492
Rym: Eh?

106
00:05:03,573 --> 00:05:04,641
Rym: That's your story?

107
00:05:05,307 --> 00:05:05,730
Rym: You sure?

108
00:05:05,991 --> 00:05:07,930
Scott: I don't think he did it hard enough to bruise himself.

109
00:05:08,552 --> 00:05:10,250
Scott: Maybe he did, just to get you in trouble.

110
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,990
Rym: Is that what you're really telling me, kid?

111
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,728
Scott: Because that shit can actually happen.

112
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:20,650
Rym: The moral of this is, if you can't use a dryer without starting a fire...

113
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,497
Scott: And the dryer?

114
00:05:21,578 --> 00:05:22,687
Scott: What the fuck did you put in there?

115
00:05:22,748 --> 00:05:23,010
Scott: Paper?

116
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,048
Rym: So, as best I can tell...

117
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,210
Scott: Even money doesn't set on fire.

118
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:35,810
Rym: She put, like, something that was in a plastic bag in there, and it caught fire and melted, and then all the clothes caught fire, and then the lint caught fire.

119
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,589
Scott: What was it, like, a Bic lighter inside of a plastic bag?

120
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,232
Scott: I don't know,

121
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:54,486
Rym: I mean, for example, as a kid, one of the first things my mom told me when she taught me how to do laundry was, "If you have gasoline or solvents on your clothes, wash them in the sink first, and don't put them in the dryer, air dry

122
00:05:54,507 --> 00:05:54,628
Rym: them.".

123
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:56,129
Rym: You know, that kind of advice.

124
00:05:57,071 --> 00:05:58,484
Rym: "Also, don't put plastic in the

125
00:05:58,504 --> 00:05:58,948
Rym: dryers.".

126
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:01,307
Rym: I don't know exactly what she put in the dryer.

127
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,275
Rym: The moral of what... A stick of dynamite.

128
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,608
Rym: The reason the smoke got into our apartment...

129
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,990
Scott: Fake electric chain smoke chemical.

130
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:16,229
Rym: It went out of the laundry room, and up the outside of the building, it was being sucked into the external HVAC systems.

131
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:32,989
Rym: And two, that's why our heater smelled like burning, and two, it went through the walls, up through the building, and then would disperse, and because our building's negative pressure, the second floor basically sucked most of the smoke into their rooms, and then back out into the hall.

132
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:39,950
Rym: We were one floor up, so we got maybe an order of magnitude less, and there was basically no smoke by the time we got to the fifth floor.

133
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:54,430
Rym: So, if you are in college or beyond college, and you don't know how to do your own laundry, go live with your parents, because you clearly don't deserve to live in the real world.

134
00:06:56,153 --> 00:06:57,849
Rym: That is the moral of that story.

135
00:06:58,553 --> 00:07:04,829
Rym: How did this woman, this girl, have an apartment in this building, in the same building that I have an apartment in?

136
00:07:05,131 --> 00:07:06,520
Rym: Is her mom paying for it?

137
00:07:07,526 --> 00:07:08,090
Rym: I don't know.

138
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:10,925
Rym: How do people get into the real world and not know how to do stuff?

139
00:07:12,212 --> 00:07:12,929
Rym: How did that happen?

140
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,350
Scott: And even if you did, make this happen, right?

141
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:24,889
Scott: It's like, if this happened to me, if I was drying my clothes and there was a fire, I'd call the fire department and be like, "I was drying my clothes and the fucking fire

142
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:25,050
Scott: started.".

143
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:27,850
Scott: I must have put something crazy in there.

144
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,783
Scott: Maybe it was left in my pocket.

145
00:07:28,844 --> 00:07:29,189
Scott: I don't know.

146
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,326
Rym: Yeah, what if they were like, "Did you put anything made of

147
00:07:31,387 --> 00:07:31,710
Rym: nylon?"?

148
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,916
Rym: And then I was like, "Oh.

149
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:34,282
Rym: Oh, fuck, I did.

150
00:07:34,342 --> 00:07:35,126
Rym: Yeah, my bad.

151
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:35,749
Rym: I fucked

152
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,870
Rym: up.".

153
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,589
Scott: Also, there's a fire extinguisher in my laundry room, and I know how to use it.

154
00:07:39,731 --> 00:07:43,770
Rym: There is not in our laundry room, but I did recently buy a fire extinguisher for our apartment.

155
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,419
Scott: What did you get?

156
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:44,990
Scott: It was on Amazon?

157
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:45,849
Rym: Yeah, super cheap.

158
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,030
Scott: Send me which one that is.

159
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:48,070
Rym: I did my research.

160
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,286
Rym: I bought the exact right size one for an apartment our size.

161
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:57,050
Rym: My primary expected use of this-- Is eventual kitchen disaster.

162
00:07:58,231 --> 00:07:59,590
Scott: Oil on fire is my number one.

163
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,470
Scott: I need the kind that can put out an oil kitchen fire.

164
00:08:01,893 --> 00:08:03,104
Rym: Yep, I got an ABC.

165
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:03,770
Rym: I'll show it to you.

166
00:08:03,911 --> 00:08:04,603
Rym: It's like the perfect one.

167
00:08:04,623 --> 00:08:05,030
Rym: Super cheap.

168
00:08:05,512 --> 00:08:05,728
Scott: All right.

169
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,149
Rym: So, yeah.

170
00:08:08,312 --> 00:08:17,650
Rym: The main reason I bring this up as a moral is because at RIT, I knew a lot of people who could not do their own laundry or cook, and none of those people graduated.

171
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:18,408
Scott: Nope.

172
00:08:20,191 --> 00:08:20,538
Rym: So, yeah.

173
00:08:20,722 --> 00:08:21,009
Scott: That's it.

174
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,123
Rym: So, gaming.

175
00:08:22,184 --> 00:08:22,509
Scott: Tuesday.

176
00:08:23,013 --> 00:08:29,787
Scott: The biggest gaming news seems to be that Irrational Games, which is a game studio that is owned by Take-Two, right?

177
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:36,970
Scott: And they are the developers of many famous games, mostly known for System Shock, Bioshock, Bioshock Infinite, et cetera.

178
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:41,630
Rym: Wow, so the AAA, like the games that people go to is the gold standard of a AAA game.

179
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:51,358
Scott: They are winding down in its current form, and all but about 15 members will be laid off according to the co-founder Ken Levine, who?

180
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:52,250
Scott: or Levine, whatever.

181
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,690
Scott: I think he was a PEX keynote guy once, right?

182
00:08:54,913 --> 00:08:55,345
Scott: I think so.

183
00:08:56,113 --> 00:08:56,490
Scott: Possibly.

184
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:09,130
Scott: Anyway, but if you read the news, right, and, you know, who knows the reality of this, whatever, and people always get upset when there are layoffs in the gaming industry, but it's like, look, it's like a fickle kind of industry, right?

185
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:14,610
Scott: A game studio going down is basically the same as, like, a band getting unpopular or whatever, right?

186
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,870
Scott: It's like you haven't come out with any hit songs in a while, right?

187
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:18,828
Scott: You're done.

188
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,070
Scott: But this one's a little bit different.

189
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:23,510
Scott: I mean, you know, this has happened a lot.

190
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,589
Scott: Why haven't we ever talked about other studios laying people off and going under?

191
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:32,690
Rym: Yeah, I mean, remember there's so many penny arcades about, like, studio finishes game, immediately lays off everyone involved.

192
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,490
Scott: Right, how come we've never talked about it before?

193
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:43,069
Scott: This one, I mean, there isn't, like, a solid fact on this, but if you read the quotes, right, let me just read some of the quotes from Levine here.

194
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:51,049
Scott: "He's deeply proud of what Irrational Games has accomplished, but his passion has turned to making a different kind of game than we've done before.

195
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:58,270
Scott: I need to refocus my energy on a smaller team with a flatter structure and a more direct relationship with gamers," he wrote in his open letter.

196
00:09:58,772 --> 00:10:03,405
Scott: "In many ways, it will be returned to how we started a small team making games for the core gaming

197
00:10:03,465 --> 00:10:03,748
Scott: audience.".

198
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:07,670
Scott: So that, to me, sounds like I'm tired of this shit.

199
00:10:08,434 --> 00:10:09,630
Scott: I want to do something different.

200
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:15,388
Scott: So I'm going to fire all your asses and then just do what I want to do with a handful of people because that's what I want to do.

201
00:10:15,793 --> 00:10:17,230
Rym: That is what it sounds like to me.

202
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,026
Scott: That is what it sounds like to me, and it's like, why?

203
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:29,089
Scott: If you want to do something small, why don't you just fucking leave with your people and let these other people stay here and keep making their Bioshock Infinite DLCs and let someone else take that shit over?

204
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:35,667
Scott: And take two, who's the boss of this guy, why don't you be like, fuck you, you're fired.

205
00:10:37,051 --> 00:10:43,629
Scott: These people are going to keep continuing on their money-making endeavor without you, and you can go do your small thing you want to do somewhere else.

206
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,690
Rym: Well, there's definitely got to be a little more to it than that.

207
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:55,246
Scott: Yeah, there's something going on here, but from the quotes, this guy's basically saying, "I just want to do something different, so fuck all y'all, I don't give a shit about

208
00:10:55,267 --> 00:10:55,368
Scott: you.".

209
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:01,509
Rym: Well, we're pretty aware of the fact that this industry is dysfunctional to an insane degree.

210
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,849
Rym: We know that.

211
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,270
Rym: So I can't say that this surprises me.

212
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,109
Rym: I mean, this sort of behavior is kind of common.

213
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:15,004
Rym: It's just weird that these personal-- This guy would actually say it that way, as opposed to--.

214
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:29,547
Scott: Usually when you lay people off, you say, "We're not making a lot of money, sorry, it's the reality of the world, I regret everything, it just sucks, this is the way things go, our last project wasn't very successful, so we have to lay you

215
00:11:29,729 --> 00:11:29,790
Scott: off.".

216
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:38,087
Rym: Think of it this way, if they weren't making a lot of money and that was the story somehow, then that's another big deal of, "Hey, AAA games can't make

217
00:11:38,148 --> 00:11:38,370
Rym: money.".

218
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,930
Scott: But if that was the story, wouldn't the take-two stock have gone down, not up today?

219
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,970
Scott: It's public, so people know how much money it's making.

220
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,825
Rym: I feel kind of conflicted.

221
00:11:46,885 --> 00:11:49,668
Rym: that-- I mean, I own a bunch of take-two stock, I bought it a long time ago.

222
00:11:50,671 --> 00:11:56,150
Rym: Yeah, I bought it a long time ago because, one, it was cheap, and two-- You're a nerd, so you had to buy something that was gaming related?

223
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:03,328
Rym: No, it was cheap and I thought it was really undervalued, just for the simple fact that I think the financial world ignores the video game world.

224
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:03,883
Scott: Possibly.

225
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,009
Scott: Also because it's really high risk.

226
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:09,169
Scott: Eh, so, uh-- As we have seen.

227
00:12:09,411 --> 00:12:11,790
Rym: Yeah, the stock skyrocketed on the news.

228
00:12:11,912 --> 00:12:12,809
Rym: Relatively speaking.

229
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:16,610
Rym: 6%, over 6% in one day is a pretty big skyrocket.

230
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:23,590
Scott: That's big, but yeah, any time a company lays people off, the stock's gonna go up, but you have to be invested in the company before that shit happens.

231
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:37,330
Rym: So I made a sizable pile of money on the news that all these people in the industry of my passion lost their jobs due to what, at least on the surface, sounds like some other person's personal passion.

232
00:12:37,731 --> 00:12:46,030
Scott: If you get the feeling layoffs are coming at the place you work, buy the stock of your own company, but you can't do it if someone can prove for sure that you knew layoffs are coming.

233
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,269
Rym: Yes, that's called insider trading.

234
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:54,410
Scott: Right, like if you knew for sure that you were part of the layoff making decision, don't buy your own stock because you will go to jail.

235
00:12:54,511 --> 00:13:06,059
Scott: But if you get wind or maybe just a feeling that something bad's going down, buy your own company's stock and then when the SEC comes to ask, be like, "I worked at the company, I wanted to invest in it, it's completely innocent,".

236
00:13:06,301 --> 00:13:12,010
Scott: and then they can't do anything because they can't prove guilt, and then when they lay you off, you'll get at least some tiny parachute.

237
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:19,490
Rym: So, I'm not sure, like we don't have enough information to talk in detail about what happened.

238
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:25,030
Rym: I don't know enough about the structure of these companies, financial filings, the real journalists can do that.

239
00:13:25,311 --> 00:13:26,427
Rym: They can explain what happened there.

240
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,389
Scott: This is going to be in the news for a couple days, if you care, keep reading it.

241
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:36,670
Rym: Investigative journalism will probably be done at length to explain more of this, but I think you hit the nail on the head.

242
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:45,547
Rym: It's weird that what he said is the kind of thing that I would say as a positive thing, like me saying, "Hey guys, I'm doing something

243
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:45,789
Rym: awesome.".

244
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:46,587
Scott: Yep.

245
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:56,329
Rym: But I can't imagine saying something like that to justify having laid off the team that made a very successful thing for me.

246
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:03,589
Scott: Yeah, they just finished making the second DLC for BioShock Infinite, so it's like, why, I don't know.

247
00:14:04,592 --> 00:14:08,389
Rym: You know, the kind of secondary moral is video game industry is fucked up.

248
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,010
Scott: Yeah.

249
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,690
Rym: I mean, people get abused professionally, very low wages, very high skill, very long hours.

250
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,629
Rym: It kind of has the professional sports problem.

251
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,749
Scott: Notice, I'm not working in that.

252
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:22,370
Rym: Yeah, notice how when I work in it, it's always on the periphery.

253
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:26,670
Rym: I would never take a job for like, I would consider working for Valve, maybe?

254
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:34,988
Scott: I would be, any evil company, however evil that company may be, however much I may hate that company, I will always take a job at it if I am the CEO.

255
00:14:35,923 --> 00:14:36,028
Rym: No?

256
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,770
Scott: 'Cause then I will make it not evil.

257
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,270
Scott: Give me any other job, I will not take that job.

258
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:46,489
Scott: But if you make me the CEO of an evil company so that I'm a un-evil and un-stupid-it, I will take that job, but no other job.

259
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:52,850
Rym: I think Valve might be the only major video game related company I would consider working for.

260
00:14:52,930 --> 00:15:05,549
Scott: I always worry about companies like that though, because I'm the person who will, in that situation, be mad lazy and do the absolute minimum amount of work, and they're looking for people who are just gonna work hard and make that their life on purpose, and that is not me.

261
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:11,748
Scott: So I remember reading a fascinating article about how charisma-- I'm like, sorry guys, can't work on Counter-Strike as much as I'd like to, gotta do some GeekNights.

262
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:23,930
Rym: Some people who quit a long time ago talked about how charisma and selling yourself within Valve matters way more than productivity in terms of staying power and sticking around and getting people to work on your projects and all that.

263
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:24,669
Scott: Oh, that's cool.

264
00:15:25,412 --> 00:15:30,589
Rym: I feel like I could convince a lot of people that I do a lot of work and not actually do anything for a long time.

265
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:34,230
Scott: I think if I was at Valve, I probably wouldn't even work on video games.

266
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:42,349
Scott: I would work on things like the Steam client, or Counter-Strike server user interface so you can run it on Linux, so that would be a pain in the ass.

267
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,597
Rym: My UX would be 99% of what I would do.

268
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:53,170
Scott: I'd be like, alright, we're fixing all these Steam community things that are not slow as balls, and your inventory will actually load quickly.

269
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,090
Rym: Yeah, someone who's good at UX, spend like a year.

270
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:58,370
Scott: You don't have to click ten times to sell an item in this frickin' workshop.

271
00:15:58,732 --> 00:15:59,690
Rym: I think that's on purpose.

272
00:16:00,671 --> 00:16:03,205
Scott: Yeah, but that's the kind of stuff that I would do.

273
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:04,030
Scott: Anyway.

274
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:10,240
Rym: Anyway, so I got kind of a geek bite rather than news, but you know the game Mafia?

275
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:11,067
Rym: We've talked about it.

276
00:16:11,731 --> 00:16:12,408
Rym: A zillion times.

277
00:16:12,611 --> 00:16:13,269
Rym: Link to a show on it.

278
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:24,130
Scott: I pretty much have lost all interest in ever playing Mafia, unless you play the original version, where the Mafias know who each other are, but have to vote individually at night and have to be unanimous.

279
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,690
Scott: So I'm still interested in playing Mafia.

280
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,310
Scott: Thus forcing the daytime communication.

281
00:16:28,513 --> 00:16:30,310
Rym: It's good as a social game to facilitate.

282
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:40,469
Rym: If you have two groups of friends who do not mutually fully know each other, Mafia is a great game to get those two groups of friends to meld.

283
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:45,529
Rym: The problem is that most people who want to play Mafia try to keep playing it after that first hour.

284
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,950
Rym: You play it for like an hour at a con, and then you fucking move on.

285
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:49,607
Scott: That is true.

286
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,370
Rym: Because Mafia, you've got to admit.

287
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:51,973
Scott: Mafia is good.

288
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,564
Scott: Three games is pretty good.

289
00:16:53,725 --> 00:16:54,470
Scott: Tenth game, no.

290
00:16:55,213 --> 00:16:58,750
Rym: Unless you're playing the serious variant, like Scott was talking about.

291
00:16:58,930 --> 00:16:59,113
Scott: Right.

292
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:00,230
Scott: That's the only one I'm going to play.

293
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,450
Rym: I played, because I thought a lot about Mafia.

294
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,010
Rym: I'm still idly working on Beaten Town and all those things.

295
00:17:07,612 --> 00:17:22,650
Rym: For the first time, despite the many, many years of thought and writing and effort and diagramming and analysis I put into Mafia, I encountered a variant of Mafia that I have, one, never encountered before, and that, two, was interesting enough to where I want to play it again.

296
00:17:22,951 --> 00:17:23,857
Scott: Whoa.

297
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,648
Scott: What the variant could possibly be?

298
00:17:25,871 --> 00:17:28,710
Rym: A good friend at Nerd NYC introduced this to me and a few other people.

299
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:30,239
Rym: Here's the shake.

300
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,269
Rym: It's the same old Mafia.

301
00:17:32,394 --> 00:17:34,090
Rym: It has a different set of roles.

302
00:17:34,492 --> 00:17:35,189
Rym: What are the roles?

303
00:17:35,491 --> 00:17:39,790
Rym: It has the angel and the archangel, like before, and other basic roles.

304
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:46,548
Rym: Then it has the drunk, who one night can flip his role with someone else and no one gets to see but him.

305
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,450
Scott: So the person who got flipped doesn't know what they are now?

306
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,949
Rym: Yeah, they don't know what they are anymore.

307
00:17:51,115 --> 00:17:51,344
Rym: Uh-oh.

308
00:17:51,831 --> 00:17:56,150
Rym: And someone else, the troublemaker, picks two other people and swaps their roles all so secretly.

309
00:17:57,332 --> 00:17:58,229
Scott: But he can't swap his own.

310
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,330
Rym: Now, a normal Mafia, that would be bullshit.

311
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:03,350
Rym: Here's why this is interesting.

312
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,870
Rym: This Mafia has one night and one day.

313
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:06,749
Scott: Oh.

314
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:12,089
Rym: One night happens, everyone does their secret shit, the Mafia recognize each other, everything happens.

315
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:19,708
Rym: Then you all wake up, you decide, you vote with Zap style on who to lynch.

316
00:18:20,956 --> 00:18:22,670
Rym: And there's some rules for how many people you play.

317
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:27,050
Rym: And basically, all the people who meet the threshold from the one point get killed.

318
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:33,729
Rym: If only Mafia people get killed, or depending on the number of players, if any Mafia people get killed, the humans win.

319
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:35,888
Rym: Otherwise, the Mafia win.

320
00:18:37,071 --> 00:18:41,610
Rym: It was the experience of you've got one day and there's a timer.

321
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:42,769
Rym: You've got five minutes.

322
00:18:43,931 --> 00:18:50,190
Rym: So the game is everyone trying to logic it out and everyone else trying to, you're trying to figure out who would change what.

323
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,749
Rym: It's almost like a timed logic puzzle.

324
00:18:54,192 --> 00:19:02,969
Rym: I was admonished because my strategy was to just lie and be super crazy in the first minute just to throw everyone off balance and try to figure out who was lying or not.

325
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:03,987
Rym: But it worked really well.

326
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:12,190
Rym: I'm going to explore this concept a little further and see if this is actually worth playing before I actually convince you to play it once with me.

327
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,970
Scott: I like the swapage of not knowing what your role is anymore.

328
00:19:16,091 --> 00:19:19,810
Rym: Because then there is a person who has privileged information who is not you.

329
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,990
Scott: But you know what that person was and you know they're the drunk now, right?

330
00:19:23,274 --> 00:19:23,363
Scott: Yeah.

331
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,508
Scott: If you swap to other people, then...

332
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,130
Rym: No, you don't know if your role was swapped, so the drunk knows that he swapped with someone else.

333
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:30,790
Scott: Right, so the drunk knows something.

334
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:34,990
Scott: The drunk knows that so-and-so was Mafia and the drunk knows so-and-so is now drunk.

335
00:19:35,411 --> 00:19:37,849
Scott: So these roles kind of serve... Or knows so-and-so wasn't.

336
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:41,069
Rym: They serve a similar purpose, I think, mathematically to the Masons.

337
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:46,590
Rym: They inject people who have privileged information, but they also inject some chaos.

338
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,230
Rym: So I don't think it would work.

339
00:19:49,132 --> 00:19:53,789
Scott: If you're the swapper who swaps two other people's roles with each other but not your own, do you get to see those two?

340
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,192
Scott: No.

341
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:54,974
Scott: No.

342
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,270
Rym: So you swap them, so you know.

343
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:03,790
Rym: So if you think that one of them is the Mafia and you think that the other one isn't, then you know, you can try to assume that they're actually the reverse.

344
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:09,530
Scott: Oh, so if you see someone's going to die, but you're pretty sure that person's safe, a civilian, because you're a civilian, right?

345
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:09,744
Rym: Yep.

346
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:16,690
Scott: And you see someone else you really think is Mafia, you swap them so that the person who dies ends up being a Mafia.

347
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,009
Rym: Now, there might be more nuance.

348
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,070
Rym: We played this quickly once, but the concept is the key.

349
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,188
Rym: I got to think about this a lot.

350
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:25,430
Scott: At least it's a new, fresh concept, and I like anything fresh.

351
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,950
Rym: The concept of one night...

352
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,770
Scott: Whether it's good or bad remains to be seen, but fresh is good.

353
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:29,962
Rym: Yep.

354
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,650
Rym: One night, five minutes, and it was actually really fun.

355
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:38,348
Rym: So I'm going to agonize over the details of the rules and see if I can coalesce it into something solid.

356
00:20:44,492 --> 00:20:46,990
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

357
00:20:48,591 --> 00:20:51,870
Scott: So, I love to have an animu thing of the day on gaming night.

358
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,290
Rym: No, that's fine, because I've got an animul thing of the day.

359
00:20:55,592 --> 00:20:56,028
Scott: Cool, okay.

360
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,430
Scott: Our buddy, Mike Toole, he has made these funny comics.

361
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,228
Scott: I think he made them.

362
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,226
Scott: He's the one posting them.

363
00:21:03,854 --> 00:21:05,490
Scott: And he put them on a Toombull all together.

364
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:06,910
Scott: Spans Daddy.

365
00:21:07,371 --> 00:21:09,910
Scott: He's a daddy guy in Spans.

366
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,950
Scott: These comics are hilarious.

367
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,630
Scott: If you've watched Spans Daddy.

368
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:19,969
Rym: If you're a fan of the rage comic style of humor, if you're a fan of GeekNights... These are so good.

369
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,928
Scott: Like, way better than they should be.

370
00:21:22,852 --> 00:21:23,908
Scott: I could read them over and over again.

371
00:21:24,356 --> 00:21:24,510
Rym: I know.

372
00:21:25,415 --> 00:21:26,008
Rym: Why, Daddy?

373
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,330
Scott: Spans Daddy.

374
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:31,387
Scott: Oh, snap.

375
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:36,110
Rym: So, this is a video of someone has a pet squirrel and a pet Bernese mountain dog.

376
00:21:36,912 --> 00:21:40,650
Rym: And it's a really... Like, their whole channel... Like, this squirrel is a really well-behaved house squirrel.

377
00:21:40,712 --> 00:21:41,389
Rym: He seems pretty chill.

378
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,649
Rym: So, he's got a nut.

379
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:43,869
Rym: He has to hide it somewhere.

380
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,349
Rym: Because he wants to go get it later.

381
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:49,350
Rym: He tries to hide the nut in the dog's fur.

382
00:21:50,074 --> 00:21:50,328
Scott: Okay.

383
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,825
Rym: And the dog is just like, "What the fuck are you doing,

384
00:21:52,905 --> 00:21:53,328
Rym: squirrel?".

385
00:21:54,636 --> 00:21:55,189
Rym: It's a good video.

386
00:21:56,094 --> 00:21:57,209
Rym: I had a better thing of the day.

387
00:21:57,771 --> 00:21:59,109
Rym: As in, not a YouTube video.

388
00:21:59,592 --> 00:22:00,270
Rym: And it was awesome.

389
00:22:00,631 --> 00:22:04,770
Rym: And I found it three or four days ago and I remember thinking to myself, "Well, nah, I don't need to put it in Delicious.

390
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,622
Rym: There's no way I will forget

391
00:22:06,683 --> 00:22:06,884
Rym: this.".

392
00:22:08,391 --> 00:22:09,888
Rym: Yeah, I don't remember what it was.

393
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:12,088
Rym: So, you get a squirrel instead.

394
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:13,790
Rym: Metamoment.

395
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,029
Rym: The Book Club book is wool.

396
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,309
Rym: Too many people told us to read it.

397
00:22:16,612 --> 00:22:17,050
Scott: I will read it.

398
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:18,469
Scott: I didn't have a copy of my house.

399
00:22:19,011 --> 00:22:19,267
Rym: Oh, yeah.

400
00:22:19,752 --> 00:22:20,588
Rym: I'll give you a copy then.

401
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,849
Scott: I somehow managed to dump them all.

402
00:22:24,772 --> 00:22:25,410
Rym: So, yeah.

403
00:22:25,914 --> 00:22:26,670
Rym: Watch our videos.

404
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:27,850
Rym: See us at PAX East.

405
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,750
Rym: See us at Zank icon.

406
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:30,470
Scott: Anime Boston.

407
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,529
Rym: See us at Anime Boston.

408
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:32,530
Rym: Yep.

409
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,370
Rym: We're doing a bunch of panels at Anime Boston.

410
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,330
Rym: I think we already published our schedule of panels.

411
00:22:36,672 --> 00:22:39,830
Rym: In fact, I think I can pull up the schedule right now because I think it's on the website.

412
00:22:40,831 --> 00:22:42,209
Rym: Typing in the name of our website.

413
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,270
Rym: We were doing, on Friday, fundamental anime.

414
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:47,630
Rym: And then right afterward, judge anime by its cover.

415
00:22:47,811 --> 00:22:50,310
Rym: On Saturday, we were doing the secret guide to running panels.

416
00:22:50,771 --> 00:22:54,310
Rym: And then, not all anime are what they see.

417
00:22:55,114 --> 00:22:55,448
Scott: That's it?

418
00:22:55,714 --> 00:22:56,028
Rym: That's it.

419
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:56,730
Rym: Four panels.

420
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:57,890
Scott: So, we're not going to be here.

421
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,590
Scott: I guess we got a hotel for Saturday night.

422
00:22:59,810 --> 00:22:59,901
Rym: Yeah.

423
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:01,868
Rym: Do you want to drive home Saturday night?

424
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:02,255
Scott: Nah.

425
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,850
Rym: Or do you want to hang out in Boston and eat the awesome Boston food?

426
00:23:05,073 --> 00:23:05,909
Scott: We can do that, I guess.

427
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,081
Scott: Yeah.

428
00:23:06,572 --> 00:23:06,966
Rym: Hang out.

429
00:23:07,311 --> 00:23:09,689
Rym: Sunday, we'll just go play tabletop for a few hours and then drive home.

430
00:23:10,576 --> 00:23:11,186
Rym: Like we always do.

431
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:12,310
Scott: All right.

432
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:13,988
Rym: Yeah, that's it.

433
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:14,909
Rym: Follow our stuff.

434
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,470
Rym: No need to go over all that again.

435
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,890
Rym: I assume you guys know the drill.

436
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:23,390
Rym: So, I got it open right now and Red's been stuck in this elevator for like an hour.

437
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,669
Scott: Well, democracy just got activated, so.

438
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,869
Rym: Yeah, so already there's code around this bullshit now.

439
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:29,336
Rym: Yeah.

440
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:30,338
Rym: Yeah.

441
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,970
Rym: So, what are we watching, Scott?

442
00:23:32,771 --> 00:23:36,870
Scott: So, someone, you know, we already saw Saltybet and that was worth an episode, right?

443
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:42,810
Rym: And of course, immediately when Saltybet happens, Scott and I had the conversation we've had many times in our life of, "We are stupid.

444
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,470
Rym: Why we not think of this?

445
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,200
Rym: Too late to

446
00:23:45,241 --> 00:23:45,445
Rym: do.".

447
00:23:45,811 --> 00:23:47,370
Scott: So, here, Twitch plays Pokemon.

448
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:48,628
Scott: We are stupid.

449
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:49,909
Scott: Why we not think of this?

450
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:50,727
Scott: Too late to do.

451
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,130
Scott: If we copy it, it will not be nearly as popular.

452
00:23:53,310 --> 00:24:02,429
Scott: But yeah, apparently coming up with ideas built on the Twitch API, I didn't realize the chat was something you could access from the API in real time, but it is.

453
00:24:03,551 --> 00:24:08,170
Scott: So yeah, this is going to be mad successful here.

454
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:11,910
Scott: Basically, if you haven't seen it, which I can't imagine you haven't being on the internet.

455
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:12,870
Rym: Twitch plays Pokemon.

456
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:13,969
Scott: Twitch plays Pokemon.

457
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:27,490
Scott: They set up a game of Pokemon Red and they hooked it up to Twitch, so you watched the game on Twitch live streaming and in the chat, you type in a command and the commands get all buffered up and then they get executed, so you can type into the chat.

458
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:28,550
Rym: I don't think they got buffered.

459
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:32,789
Rym: I think it just sent them all to the game, so if you type something that the game wouldn't respond to, it would just ignore it.

460
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:33,167
Scott: No, no.

461
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,590
Scott: It's just the only commands you could type were up, left, down, right, A, B, select, or start.

462
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:42,650
Scott: If you type one of those, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight things, then it would get sent to the game eventually.

463
00:24:43,110 --> 00:25:02,090
Scott: I think it took like, people were saying it takes like 20 or 30 seconds for your command to get sent through, you know, while it's waiting for everyone else's to go through, and then you just see what happens in the game and you would think you would just randomly walk around like Red's house, you know, not doing anything, but actually, they made significant progress.

464
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:06,650
Scott: Who knows how much, it takes a long time for them to make progress, but somehow it happens.

465
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:13,865
Rym: Now, much like Salty Bet, how Salty Bet had this culture that arose from its legendary events, its legendary browser.

466
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:17,030
Scott: This is, first of all, way bigger than Salty Bet ever was.

467
00:25:17,211 --> 00:25:19,009
Rym: Well, Salty Bet's on a huge decline, too.

468
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:22,530
Scott: Yeah, well, that's because they stopped doing tournaments and they started doing those other things, so I lost interest.

469
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,170
Rym: Like, I went to Salty Bet and almost no one was betting.

470
00:25:24,372 --> 00:25:26,150
Scott: I lost all interest and they stopped doing tournaments.

471
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:32,550
Scott: If they kept up with a tournament thing with the brackets, I would have kept with it, but because they got rid of that, I sort of stopped caring.

472
00:25:33,192 --> 00:25:33,830
Scott: So, yeah.

473
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:40,790
Scott: Anyway, so yeah, Twitch latest Pokemon, the culture that has risen around this is pretty similar, right?

474
00:25:41,352 --> 00:25:43,630
Scott: For example, the inventory has the helix fossil in it.

475
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:44,409
Scott: They got it somehow.

476
00:25:45,151 --> 00:25:51,589
Scott: And something that will happen a lot is they'll try to use the helix fossil and look at it and whatever when you're not, can't use it.

477
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,910
Scott: So, there's a helix fossil religion that has now...

478
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:59,770
Rym: There's already, I saw people with shirts ready to bring to anime Boston artists' alleys.

479
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,945
Rym: They're like, "Keep calm and consult the helix

480
00:26:02,005 --> 00:26:02,389
Rym: fossil.".

481
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:09,870
Rym: This shit, this and Salty Bet prove, once again, that internet culture moves so fast.

482
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:14,183
Rym: It goes from nothing to the community around.

483
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:18,970
Rym: this game that's only been running for five days is distinct from other communities.

484
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:22,303
Rym: Now, this was crazy.

485
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,030
Rym: This is Action Castle.

486
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:26,049
Rym: What happens when we play Action Castle at comms?

487
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:33,853
Rym: Some asshole tries to derail the game, kill self, end game, drop key, climb tree, climb tree.

488
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:37,330
Scott: This is basically Action Castle for a video game, right?

489
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:44,169
Scott: Everyone stands in line in the chat, hands in their one command, press A, press B, and then they get executed and ordered.

490
00:26:45,152 --> 00:26:47,930
Rym: Now, of course, people are trying to troll.

491
00:26:48,213 --> 00:26:50,010
Rym: People are trying to troll like crazy.

492
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:53,210
Scott: They want to release Pokémon, they want to die in battle on purpose.

493
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,070
Rym: I watched a highlight of the most epic moment.

494
00:26:55,310 --> 00:27:09,709
Scott: The epic moment, yeah, they're walking on a ledge, the kind of ledge where you can go down but you can't go up, and they had to walk right a whole bunch of times in a row in order to succeed at getting to where they needed to go, and of course, some fucker puts in down and then had to try and walk all the way around again.

495
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:10,325
Rym: Yup.

496
00:27:10,751 --> 00:27:13,450
Rym: I heard it took them some six hours to get past that spot.

497
00:27:14,031 --> 00:27:16,050
Scott: They made it eventually, though, which is amazing.

498
00:27:16,472 --> 00:27:20,490
Rym: Now, I've been looking into how - monkeys and typewriters, literally.

499
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:27,049
Rym: What's interesting that a lot of people are talking about is how come this is progressing at all?

500
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,150
Scott: How is it possibly as far into the game as it is?

501
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:30,970
Scott: I wonder that myself.

502
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,810
Scott: How come they're not just wandering around Red's house talking to his mom?

503
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:49,470
Rym: So apparently the answer is that a good number of the people are actually trying to win, and two, those people are so mad and so dedicated to this that they are coordinating outside of the game to make these things happen.

504
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:54,590
Rym: For example, I'm going to read - there's a Kotaku article about this.

505
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,608
Rym: I'm going to quote from it.

506
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:58,882
Rym: Here's Carr talking about strategies.

507
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:00,529
Rym: the stream had come up with.

508
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:01,546
Rym: The ledge.

509
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:13,909
Rym: Players noticed that the tree was directly in line with the building's entrance and realized that if we could get the player inside the building, all we would have to do is mash the down button to end up directly in front of the tree.

510
00:28:15,011 --> 00:28:24,689
Rym: So by using the building as a funnel, we could line ourselves up with the door and cut down the tree much more easily than having to walk over to it and then cut down the tree.

511
00:28:25,731 --> 00:28:27,370
Rym: Or the start buffer.

512
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:31,390
Rym: Because of the delay, people would type all their commands.

513
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:40,210
Rym: So the down command that got accepted by the game might have been from a while ago, and then say you got down and now you want to go right.

514
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:45,649
Rym: Other people who type down way later are still streaming through.

515
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:51,090
Rym: Kind of like how when everyone tries to clap at the same time, there's all those jackasses clapping way before and way after.

516
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:59,170
Rym: So to get around that, the non-trolls would constantly spam start in between moves.

517
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,640
Scott: So they'd be like, "Down

518
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,083
Scott: start!"

519
00:29:02,071 --> 00:29:03,501
Scott: And then they'd be like, "Start

520
00:29:03,582 --> 00:29:03,602
Scott: A!"

521
00:29:04,794 --> 00:29:04,928
Scott: Right?

522
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,507
Rym: "Down start start start start start start start

523
00:29:06,568 --> 00:29:06,710
Rym: start."

524
00:29:06,961 --> 00:29:07,150
Rym: Right.

525
00:29:07,811 --> 00:29:23,870
Scott: So everyone else's commands would just get funneled into the menu and not do anything, and because not too many people are doing start, they press start and then put their commands and then press start again, so that everyone else's commands would go into the menu and their commands are the ones actually making a move in between the starts.

526
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:37,210
Rym: They also have the b-roll, at least that's what one person called it, where if trolls have an advantage, like if trolls were just really messing around, everyone would just spam B to counteract anything they tried to do until they got bored and gave up.

527
00:29:38,031 --> 00:29:43,430
Scott: So if anyone's trying to open menus and release Pokemon, all the good people spam B until the trolls stop.

528
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,790
Rym: Enable the b-roll.

529
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:45,585
Scott: Yup.

530
00:29:46,432 --> 00:29:48,869
Scott: And they coordinate, so they would have a person being like, "Everyone B!

531
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:49,636
Scott: B-B-B-B!".

532
00:29:50,531 --> 00:29:54,141
Scott: Alright, and then when trolls have stopped, it's like, "Okay, now we're gonna do a start buffer to get things going

533
00:29:54,162 --> 00:29:54,344
Scott: again.".

534
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,484
Rym: So he's still in the elevator.

535
00:29:59,951 --> 00:30:02,710
Rym: He's trying desperately to activate the elevator.

536
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:06,011
Scott: It seems like something has been added to the game since we started, and it seems to be.

537
00:30:06,051 --> 00:30:09,210
Scott: there's some sort of system of voting between democracy and anarchy.

538
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:15,789
Scott: So there's a meta-democracy where by typing in democracy or anarchy, you move the game either towards democracy or anarchy.

539
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:20,909
Scott: So it is a democracy where anarchy is one of the things you can vote for, but you can always vote for democracy again.

540
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:36,450
Scott: So what it looks like is once you get it to democracy by typing anarchy or democracy, then- Once democracy wins the election, the democratic election, if democracy is voted in, then basically anyone who types anything in, it gets voted as an option.

541
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:44,570
Scott: And then, so basically instead of just all the A's happening, right, it's people vote, and if A wins, A gets pressed, and then they vote again.

542
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:47,150
Rym: Which obviously is going to be excruciatingly slow.

543
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:53,294
Scott: Right, because you're basically waiting a period of however long for the vote to tally up.

544
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,650
Rym: There's a meter, and you can see it moving back and forth.

545
00:30:55,831 --> 00:30:57,550
Rym: A while ago, the game was not progressing.

546
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,948
Rym: They were stuck in the elevator the whole time.

547
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,990
Scott: Well, it was in anarchy when we started watching.

548
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,489
Scott: Now it seems to be in democracy mode.

549
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:07,370
Scott: This anarchy/democracy thing didn't exist when I started watching like a day ago.

550
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:08,530
Rym: Wait, Scott.

551
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:11,830
Rym: It's almost like this game is evolving.

552
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,464
Scott: It's been going on for five days, 22 hours, 48 minutes, 34 seconds.

553
00:31:15,464 --> 00:31:19,310
Scott: 35, 6.

554
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:24,230
Scott: And they still haven't won, but I think they're eventually going to win, and they're going to lose their shit when that happens.

555
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:27,270
Rym: I don't know if they could have won if they didn't have this democracy bar.

556
00:31:28,111 --> 00:31:35,830
Scott: I think it would have taken much, much longer without this democracy bar, but I think eventually, After months, I mean, look how far they've made it in five days.

557
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,009
Scott: They have gym badges.

558
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:38,126
Scott: Gym badges.

559
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:44,050
Rym: Holy, I could- There are over 70,000 people watching this right now.

560
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,687
Scott: If you told me they even had one gym badge, I'd have been like, "What the

561
00:31:46,767 --> 00:31:46,989
Scott: fuck?"

562
00:31:47,471 --> 00:31:51,650
Scott: With anarchy only, they got gym badges, plural, they leveled up Pokemon.

563
00:31:51,913 --> 00:31:52,183
Scott: I saw.

564
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,489
Scott: I watched them win battles.

565
00:31:54,834 --> 00:31:55,210
Scott: Seriously.

566
00:31:56,131 --> 00:31:59,549
Rym: This chat is scrolling so fast, you can't even read it.

567
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:00,036
Scott: Yeah.

568
00:32:01,293 --> 00:32:05,390
Rym: So- So, why is this popular?

569
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:12,050
Rym: Is it popular for the same reasons that Action Castle is popular, just on a wider scale?

570
00:32:12,251 --> 00:32:15,250
Scott: I mean, it's just fascinating to see that it can happen.

571
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:15,728
Rym: Ah, yes.

572
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:20,950
Rym: Fascinating to see, but I tried to ... You can't watch this.

573
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:24,609
Rym: What kind of fucking person do you have to be to watch this?

574
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:28,648
Scott: To participate, it's like you typed him down, and he moved down, and it's like, "I did

575
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:28,949
Scott: that.".

576
00:32:29,391 --> 00:32:36,990
Scott: It's like, imagine if you're watching TV, and you could actually have one ... No matter how minute, you could have some control over what happened.

577
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:41,844
Rym: You're watching Twin Peaks, and you're all just spamming like, "Don't open door, don't open door, don't open

578
00:32:41,884 --> 00:32:42,208
Rym: door.".

579
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:45,670
Scott: All right, and because you typed, "Don't open door," he didn't open the door.

580
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:50,087
Scott: Your input, however minute, actually affected something that other people had to see, right?

581
00:32:51,191 --> 00:32:52,829
Rym: But simultaneously- And people get off on that.

582
00:32:53,091 --> 00:32:56,070
Rym: It's the collective, like you can feel like you're part of the zeitgeist.

583
00:32:56,211 --> 00:32:56,850
Rym: Right, exactly.

584
00:32:57,151 --> 00:32:59,690
Rym: But at the same time, watching- What I had to say mattered.

585
00:32:59,974 --> 00:33:00,250
Rym: It happened.

586
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,029
Rym: But watching it- Also, I'm a troll.

587
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,249
Scott: I trolled on purpose, and it happened.

588
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:09,170
Rym: It's fun for a few minutes, because it's like watching someone who's possessed by a demon trying to brush his teeth.

589
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:19,969
Rym: The demon's trying to punch him in the face, and he's desperately fighting back against the demon, trying to get the toothbrush into his mouth, into the eye, ah, into the eye, oh, all right, got it in the mouth, back into the eye.

590
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:21,270
Scott: Back into the back of the throat.

591
00:33:24,251 --> 00:33:26,090
Rym: He's still stuck in this fucking elevator, right?

592
00:33:27,796 --> 00:33:29,310
Scott: I think they're trying to get it to the right floor.

593
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:32,930
Rym: That's why they pushed it to democracy, but look, it's edging rapidly toward anarchy.

594
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:41,250
Scott: I think what happens is once it gets to democracy, you only have a few inputs, because Twitch will basically buffer your chat.

595
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:52,087
Scott: It's like you can't chat again for like some 30 seconds or whatever, so if democracy wins the vote, all the democracy people will start typing in like up or down to get the thing they want to do.

596
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,950
Rym: And all the trolls will be like anarchy, anarchy, anarchy.

597
00:33:53,950 --> 00:34:06,630
Scott: The trolls, meanwhile, during democracy mode will type in anarchy to get democracy mode ended, and so if it gets to democracy, they just have to use all the democracy they can to make progress.

598
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:10,170
Scott: They can't keep voting democracy while they're in democracy mode.

599
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,630
Scott: That won't work, right?

600
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:16,170
Rym: I think you can vote for multiple commands, because I see up to, start from nine.

601
00:34:16,371 --> 00:34:19,409
Scott: I'm seeing new stuff happen that I haven't seen before.

602
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,270
Rym: A down to A won the vote.

603
00:34:21,391 --> 00:34:25,989
Scott: I kind of liked it when they just, it's like they made a lot of progress with just the anarchy and just the commands.

604
00:34:26,092 --> 00:34:27,170
Scott: They should have just left it that way.

605
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,159
Scott: I kind of don't like that.

606
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:29,290
Scott: they added this extra stuff.

607
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:30,748
Scott: I liked it being as a meta.

608
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,790
Rym: It feels like the victory will be less pure.

609
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:33,713
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

610
00:34:33,793 --> 00:34:42,908
Scott: I like that stuff better when it was outside the system trying to work, you know, as opposed to now where I see people voting for A down to A, right, to work the elevator.

611
00:34:44,231 --> 00:34:46,570
Rym: At least A down to A could never win anarchy.

612
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:54,489
Rym: So this is really, it's just, it's a fascinating thing that I can't watch like I would watch.

613
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,909
Scott: No, this is not something you can watch like Salty Bet.

614
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:01,670
Scott: What you have to do is you have to watch highlights on YouTube and say, wow, somehow all that craziness ended up in there.

615
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:05,545
Rym: But at the same time, I can see that core appeal, like you said, of being a part of it.

616
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,550
Rym: Because I remember this moment.

617
00:35:07,232 --> 00:35:07,628
Rym: Oh my God.

618
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:09,229
Rym: I don't think I've ever talked about this on the show.

619
00:35:09,571 --> 00:35:12,290
Rym: So this is a moment from back when I played the realm.

620
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,089
Scott: How did I know it was going to be the realm?

621
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,369
Rym: So Sierra is the realm.

622
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:19,730
Scott: So Sierra's log on server actually was about to say the realm.

623
00:35:20,015 --> 00:35:20,629
Scott: Was it the realm?

624
00:35:20,832 --> 00:35:21,250
Rym: It's the realm.

625
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,369
Scott: I'm not even joking.

626
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,549
Rym: Sierra's log on server failed.

627
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:28,490
Rym: People who are already in the game could keep playing.

628
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,529
Rym: No one knew could join.

629
00:35:31,532 --> 00:35:34,550
Rym: A couple hours went by and this was still the case.

630
00:35:35,072 --> 00:35:38,950
Rym: So people in the forums or the BBS were posting like, oh my God, don't log out.

631
00:35:39,291 --> 00:35:43,348
Rym: So the people left in the game started to realize you were left in the game where I was still in the game.

632
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,809
Rym: So we started to realize, oh, shit's going down.

633
00:35:46,451 --> 00:35:48,909
Rym: So people started having these little wars and things.

634
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,029
Rym: Now the game was also kind of unstable at the time.

635
00:35:51,572 --> 00:35:52,949
Rym: So occasionally like you just get kicked out.

636
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,068
Scott: Imagine if it happened in like Eve.

637
00:35:54,551 --> 00:35:55,149
Rym: Oh my God.

638
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,909
Scott: It's like, who's logged in right now?

639
00:35:57,311 --> 00:35:58,289
Scott: We can start a war right now.

640
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,190
Scott: They can't get to the computer.

641
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:00,309
Rym: Who's left?

642
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:05,421
Rym: So eventually through attrition, I was hanging out like I was leveling, I was leveling up anyways.

643
00:36:05,751 --> 00:36:06,190
Rym: I was like, whatever.

644
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:10,169
Rym: So they kept playing and eventually there's only like a couple hundred people left.

645
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:14,010
Rym: So suddenly the whole game is like empty, which I'd never seen before.

646
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,650
Rym: Like I'm walking around towns and there's aren't a lot of people.

647
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:20,249
Rym: So people started congregating in particular areas.

648
00:36:20,871 --> 00:36:24,589
Rym: But if too many people were in one area, people would start to lag out.

649
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,650
Rym: So that brought the attrition down even further.

650
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:36,390
Rym: And I just remember like feeling like this was such a cool, memorable thing and being a part of it and being, because you can only fit so many people on one screen.

651
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:43,670
Rym: So eventually I got to the town square and I was one of 17 people hanging out in the town square of the biggest town, Leenster.

652
00:36:44,413 --> 00:36:46,070
Rym: And we were just having an internet party.

653
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:49,089
Scott: Imagine if it's like World of Warcraft and no one could log in.

654
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:54,148
Rym: And then 17 people are the only people logged in right now and they're all hanging out in one town.

655
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:56,710
Scott: I think there are only 17 people still logged into World of Warcraft.

656
00:36:58,453 --> 00:36:59,910
Scott: That will be true one day, not today.

657
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:00,222
Scott: Someday.

658
00:37:00,611 --> 00:37:01,548
Scott: One day, that will be true.

659
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:02,081
Rym: Yeah.

660
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,489
Rym: I mean, EverQuest had what, nine expansions before it died?

661
00:37:05,853 --> 00:37:07,070
Scott: Do you still have to pay to play that shit?

662
00:37:07,555 --> 00:37:08,549
Scott: We should start playing it now.

663
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:10,563
Scott: Yeah.

664
00:37:11,631 --> 00:37:14,390
Rym: You know, I killed enough King Killrogs in my day.

665
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:15,507
Rym: I don't need to play another MMO.

666
00:37:17,473 --> 00:37:20,473
Rym: But I remember there was a moment when my dad was like, hey, you want to go and get dinner?

667
00:37:20,493 --> 00:37:22,069
Rym: Because like my brother and mom were out of town.

668
00:37:22,411 --> 00:37:25,410
Rym: And I was like, no man, I got to, I got to stay.

669
00:37:25,692 --> 00:37:27,329
Rym: And I tried to explain to him what was going on.

670
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:30,170
Rym: And he just looked at me like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

671
00:37:30,611 --> 00:37:31,450
Rym: OK, fine.

672
00:37:31,591 --> 00:37:32,073
Rym: Whatever.

673
00:37:32,093 --> 00:37:35,760
Scott: Imagine if it's like they're about to beat the elite four and Twitch plays Pokemon.

674
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,349
Scott: They're battling.

675
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:37,011
Rym: Yeah.

676
00:37:37,111 --> 00:37:37,272
Rym: Once

677
00:37:37,312 --> 00:37:39,141
Scott: you realize, guys, the people

678
00:37:39,182 --> 00:37:49,951
Rym: who were there during the hedge, the ledge incident or the tree incident, they're going to remember that the rest of their lives, the way I remember that fucking time when I hung out on the realm until only 17 people were like,

679
00:37:50,172 --> 00:37:54,690
Scott: imagine if it was your press of up that got them up the way from the ledge.

680
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:55,789
Scott: Imagine you're the guy who.

681
00:37:56,070 --> 00:38:01,410
Rym: Imagine if it was your press that threw away your legendary right before the elite four.

682
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:04,030
Scott: They got a Mewtwo and then you throw it away.

683
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,990
Scott: You're the one who released Mewtwo into the wild.

684
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,879
Scott: You're A. So I think what's going to happen?

685
00:38:07,899 --> 00:38:14,933
Rym: and the guy right after you press B, this thing is going to be going on for a while and there's going to be a core of people who are really into it.

686
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:21,770
Rym: But whenever they get close to a big event, Internet word is going to spread and they're going to get orders of magnitude and more people.

687
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:22,010
Scott: Yeah.

688
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:28,669
Scott: You're going to basically see like, you know, people lose interest and then things will actually start to progress faster when interest wanes.

689
00:38:29,011 --> 00:38:33,011
Scott: But then they won't go fast, but they'll go relatively fast to how slow they're going now.

690
00:38:33,071 --> 00:38:41,670
Scott: And then when they accomplish something, news will spread and it'll sort of be that thing that comes back every once every few days, weeks.

691
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:46,612
Rym: I think when they get the elite four, it's probably going to crash under the sheer viewership on.

692
00:38:46,672 --> 00:38:49,810
Scott: Twitch will go through the roof when it hits the elite four.

693
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:50,413
Scott: I'm just not.

694
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:52,769
Scott: if that happens, I won't even type anything and I'll just watch.

695
00:38:52,991 --> 00:38:56,272
Rym: Well, they got out of the elevator, but they haven't gotten very far trying to open that door.

696
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:56,757
Scott: I don't think they.

697
00:38:56,818 --> 00:38:57,870
Scott: I think they need a key for that.

698
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:58,578
Scott: I don't remember.

699
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,326
Rym: Well, they're up.

700
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,729
Rym: Nine is winning the vote for some reason.

701
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:06,130
Scott: OK, so I'm just going to go, oh, yeah, everyone's trying to press a to open it now.

702
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:11,170
Rym: Hey, hey, hey, up nine, up nine and a up nine and a I think it's after they hit a.

703
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,050
Scott: they want to go up nine spaces, maybe.

704
00:39:14,731 --> 00:39:18,970
Rym: So, yeah, this is an interesting Internet gamer phenomenon.

705
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:26,010
Rym: Imagine explaining to a kid when Pokemon was out on the Gameboy, I think they also picked the absolute perfect game, right?

706
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:26,895
Scott: You could not pick.

707
00:39:27,036 --> 00:39:29,652
Scott: It's like you try to think like, oh, I can beat them if I do a better game.

708
00:39:29,773 --> 00:39:30,336
Scott: Mario.

709
00:39:30,397 --> 00:39:31,141
Rym: No, they're.

710
00:39:31,181 --> 00:39:32,650
Scott: first of all, it can't be a real time game.

711
00:39:33,113 --> 00:39:34,950
Scott: It has to be ridiculously popular game.

712
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:38,870
Scott: And they chose the original Gameboy version, which is like the ultimate.

713
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:40,829
Rym: It has to be a relatively simple game.

714
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:45,990
Rym: Yeah, it has to be a game where you can't like break it just by doing actions.

715
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:51,167
Rym: It can't be a game like, I don't know, a shadow game where you could throw things away and you're literally fucked.

716
00:39:52,351 --> 00:39:54,410
Rym: You know, they theoretically game that has an end game.

717
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:55,648
Rym: It can't be a game that you can lose.

718
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,610
Scott: Theoretically, they could get to the main menu and like delete their game.

719
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,470
Scott: But no, that requires holding buttons down.

720
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:05,350
Scott: I think I don't know if they can do actually accomplish that anyway.

721
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:10,648
Rym: Yeah, but like it couldn't be a game like any game that that doesn't have infinite continues like it couldn't be.

722
00:40:11,331 --> 00:40:12,518
Rym: There's so many facts.

723
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:14,450
Rym: Pokemon is the perfect storm.

724
00:40:15,231 --> 00:40:19,188
Rym: There's going to be a lot of people are going to try to copy this phenomenon and they will fail because this is it.

725
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:22,870
Scott: Yeah, there's no point in trying to make another game to be controlled this way.

726
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:25,650
Scott: I mean, maybe if this one ends, they could do gold, silver.

727
00:40:26,471 --> 00:40:27,790
Rym: Yeah, I think they will.

728
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:28,889
Rym: I think you know what they're going to do.

729
00:40:29,251 --> 00:40:31,990
Rym: They're going to just do every Pokemon in order, every generation.

730
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:32,917
Scott: It wouldn't work on.

731
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:34,110
Scott: first of all, they can't get it.

732
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:34,973
Scott: There's no way to do it.

733
00:40:34,993 --> 00:40:38,370
Scott: The 3DS ones, I don't think maybe will be much harder.

734
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:41,210
Scott: Plus, there's more inputs and there's touching and all that kind of stuff.

735
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:41,472
Scott: Right.

736
00:40:41,955 --> 00:40:43,829
Scott: But you could do it with the GBA ones, I guess.

737
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:44,396
Scott: I don't know.

738
00:40:44,903 --> 00:40:45,269
Rym: We'll see.

739
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:49,229
Rym: So enjoy this Internet phenomenon while it lasts.

740
00:40:49,911 --> 00:40:50,073
Scott: Yep.

741
00:40:50,355 --> 00:40:51,787
Rym: They got a few days to go, I think.

742
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:55,610
Rym: How can you not but see the beauty of our evil?

743
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:57,329
Scott: It's Team Rocket headquarters, I think.

744
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,409
Rym: Yeah, they've been working on that for a while now.

745
00:41:04,523 --> 00:41:06,640
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

746
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:11,963
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

747
00:41:12,164 --> 00:41:17,225
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

748
00:41:17,466 --> 00:41:20,140
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

749
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,840
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

751
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,700
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

752
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,820
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

753
00:42:51,571 --> 00:42:53,799
Rym: No matter what you say.
