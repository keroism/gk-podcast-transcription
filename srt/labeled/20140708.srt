00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,977
Rym: It's Tuesday, July 8th, 2014.

2
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:10,279
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,793 --> 00:00:13,290
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,209
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight, a link between worlds.

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,398
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:29,069
Rym: I guess Scott really wants to be a fish.

7
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:37,170
Scott: You know, if I couldn't be a person, and I had to be a thing that exists in real life, various types of fish are not bad choices.

8
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:37,390
Scott: Well,

9
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:53,490
Rym: I recall a long time ago, we were talking about if we had demons that followed us around, or a daemon, or whatever you want to call it, and people were like, "Oh, Rym, you'd have a crow," or something like that, and then you were kind of tangential to the conversation, and then you suggested that yours would be a tiny human.

10
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,690
Rym: When we told you that wouldn't work, you decided a mechanical fish.

11
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,329
Scott: A robot fish would be pretty awesome.

12
00:00:58,551 --> 00:00:59,108
Rym: It'd be okay.

13
00:01:00,053 --> 00:01:00,950
Scott: Better than a regular fish.

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:01,332
Rym: I don't know.

15
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,810
Rym: I'm not a big fan of fish, except for the eating.

16
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,650
Rym: I'm more a fan of, I don't know, sea mammals, like dolphins.

17
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:07,558
Scott: Dolphins?

18
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:08,310
Scott: Good enough.

19
00:01:08,612 --> 00:01:09,309
Rym: Is that a fish, though?

20
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,503
Scott: No, but I'll take it.

21
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:17,969
Scott: You're just trying to, in the absence of being able to be a human, you're just trying to pick the smartest thing that is out there.

22
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:23,290
Rym: No, if I was going to pick the smartest thing, I'd pick one of the greatest apes, or like, I don't know, an African gray parrot.

23
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,250
Scott: You know, a dolphin might be smarter than some apes.

24
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,290
Scott: It just can't, you know, talk and do sign language.

25
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:34,570
Rym: One thing I do enjoy, though, is watching human babies interact with, like, dogs and horses, because it's obviously the same.

26
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:43,470
Rym: Yeah, they have the same level of cognition, and in fact, there's a point where I have seen dogs that were clearly cognitively superior to the humans they were interacting with.

27
00:01:43,973 --> 00:01:47,110
Scott: Yeah, well, the humans are either so small or, you know, so dumb.

28
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,670
Rym: Well, I had a friend in high school who, I think his ferret was a little bit smarter than him in a lot of ways.

29
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,189
Scott: Yeah, yeah, there's people like that.

30
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,770
Rym: Yeah, I wonder what he's up to.

31
00:01:54,830 --> 00:02:00,470
Rym: I think he fell for the Amway scam last time I talked to him, which was, like, 15 plus years ago.

32
00:02:00,692 --> 00:02:01,588
Scott: If that ferret could talk.

33
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,150
Scott: DeBlasio was talking about legalizing ferrets.

34
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,463
Rym: Yeah, I'm a big fan of that.

35
00:02:05,524 --> 00:02:06,050
Rym: I like ferrets.

36
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:06,674
Scott: Yeah, why not?

37
00:02:07,157 --> 00:02:08,769
Scott: I don't understand why they were illegal in the first place.

38
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:12,889
Rym: The fear was, in olden times, a ferret- Is this law really that old?

39
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,450
Rym: Yes.

40
00:02:14,231 --> 00:02:15,569
Scott: And they haven't changed it since then?

41
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:27,009
Rym: I will look up when the law happened, but the fear was that a ferret would climb between floors in the old-ass buildings in New York City, find a baby, and kill it.

42
00:02:27,736 --> 00:02:27,969
Scott: Sure.

43
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:33,130
Scott: And not that pickpockets would use them, which is a thing that happened at least once.

44
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,470
Rym: Oh my god, if I was a pickpocket, do you know how many ferrets I would have?

45
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:37,700
Scott: People would know, huh?

46
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:38,669
Scott: I got pickpocketed.

47
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,990
Scott: Maybe it's the guy with a hundred ferrets hanging out in Union Square.

48
00:02:42,332 --> 00:02:48,630
Rym: Okay, they were banned a couple of times in history, apparently, but the ban that's in effect now was put in place by Giuliani.

49
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,049
Scott: So really fucking recent.

50
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:50,510
Scott: Yeah.

51
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,050
Scott: So there's no excuse for any wrong thinking in that decision.

52
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,709
Scott: So what was their not-wrong thinking?

53
00:02:56,571 --> 00:02:59,850
Rym: Oh no, there was a lot ... Okay, this is getting really complicated.

54
00:03:00,111 --> 00:03:01,169
Rym: This isn't the show about ferrets.

55
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,430
Scott: Are you just going to abandon this topic?

56
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,327
Rym: I'm going to abandon this topic because I've noticed a trend.

57
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:24,081
Rym: I don't have a word for this yet, but this happened three times over the course of the wedding we were at last weekend where there's a discussion, two people make opposing claims, and a third person says, "All right, I'm going to look it up," which is followed by the conversation happening next to them where they go, "Oh, okay, give me a minute.

58
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,170
Rym: This article's really long.

59
00:03:25,992 --> 00:03:27,610
Rym: Oh crap, it links to these other articles.

60
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:29,283
Rym: Oh, okay, this is going to take a

61
00:03:29,303 --> 00:03:29,586
Rym: while.".

62
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:32,770
Rym: And by the time they find the answer, no one gives a shit anymore.

63
00:03:34,117 --> 00:03:34,370
Rym: Okay.

64
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:36,128
Rym: We need a word for that.

65
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,379
Scott: TLDR.

66
00:03:39,691 --> 00:03:42,103
Rym: But that's ... TLDR also is just.

67
00:03:42,123 --> 00:03:43,650
Rym: anytime you're reading anything that's too long.

68
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:49,630
Rym: This is an argument where the actual answer is complicated enough that no one cares enough to continue the argument.

69
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,270
Rym: They were in fact only arguing for the sake of arguing.

70
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:53,088
Scott: Like this right now?

71
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,592
Rym: Yes.

72
00:03:54,297 --> 00:03:56,070
Rym: Or like the Berry incident.

73
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,710
Rym: No, no, okay, the ban goes back to 1959.

74
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:04,050
Rym: The Giuliani thing was an upholding of the ban after some losses.

75
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,170
Scott: Why would they uphold it?

76
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,125
Rym: Giuliani I guess fucking hates ferrets.

77
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:07,770
Rym: I can't tell.

78
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:10,829
Rym: So I guess it's Tuesday, gaming day.

79
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:12,889
Rym: May or may not be a Thursday show.

80
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:18,529
Rym: We'll see if we feel like recording a Thursday show right now after this Tuesday show.

81
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,249
Scott: Why don't you wait for the meta moment on that?

82
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,830
Rym: Yeah, but this weekend we'll be in Connecticut at Connecticut.

83
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,446
Rym: Yeah.

84
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,388
Rym: So you got any gaming news?

85
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,019
Scott: This isn't really news.

86
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:27,950
Scott: This is from 2013.

87
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,330
Rym: Wow, 2013 is actually the last time I got an email about the thing you're going to talk about.

88
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,630
Scott: Like a year ago, August 2013.

89
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,668
Rym: Here's the email I got.

90
00:04:34,212 --> 00:04:37,284
Rym: The subject line is, "MechWarrior online mailing list.

91
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:38,047
Rym: You are now

92
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:38,890
Rym: unsubscribed.".

93
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,710
Rym: And it was the September 19th, 2013.

94
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,970
Scott: So anyone who doesn't know, there was a MechWarrior online game.

95
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:51,029
Scott: And, you know, it's basically MechWarrior, but you play it online, which is amazing, except it was pay-to-win of the highest order.

96
00:04:52,172 --> 00:04:53,310
Scott: So fuck that shit.

97
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,901
Rym: In 2011, I made my account and reserved my name.

98
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,230
Rym: I never once played the game.

99
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,328
Scott: I also, same thing.

100
00:05:00,771 --> 00:05:03,170
Scott: I reserved it when they announced it and then I never once played the game.

101
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:12,190
Scott: Anyway, so the reason that this is news is because A, I just found this recently and I don't think we've talked about it on the show before, but B, this game died horribly.

102
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:13,629
Scott: And why did it die horribly?

103
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:37,569
Scott: Mostly because this long tale that you can read about how the game developers mistreated the community so badly, worse than probably or as bad as any game ever, and this isn't like a tribe situation where they did what the community told them to, it was the opposite, where not only did they do the opposite of what the community wanted to do, they did stuff that even the people that weren't in the community didn't want them to do.

104
00:05:37,731 --> 00:05:38,989
Rym: Oh, you like miniguns?

105
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,650
Rym: Banned from the game forever.

106
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:46,410
Scott: Right, the number one thing that they did that was really bad is they put in basically this thing called CoolShot.

107
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:51,230
Scott: Now if anyone's played MechWarrior BattleTech, you know that heat is like the number one mechanic in the game.

108
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,950
Scott: You can't just fire your weapons wildly all over the place.

109
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:54,647
Scott: Hell, you can.

110
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:57,030
Scott: Sure, but your mech will overheat and explode.

111
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:04,890
Scott: So it's like, you know, BattleTech/MechWarrior is all about, you know, positioning and, you know, firing at opportune moments.

112
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:05,788
Scott: Eating management.

113
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,169
Scott: Yeah, and managing the heat.

114
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:12,890
Scott: You can't, in other games, you could just be like, you know, like Advanced Wars, move and shoot, move and shoot, unless you have ammo, right?

115
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,410
Scott: Move and shoot, just keep shooting, there's no reason not to shoot.

116
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:23,250
Rym: Yep, games like World of Warcraft have their cool-down period, so you do your attack, and then there's a cool-down, then you do your attack again, but there's no reason to not do it at the maximum rate.

117
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,730
Scott: But in BattleTech, you have this general thing, heat.

118
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:30,750
Scott: All weapons generate some amount of heat, and so it's like, you can't fire weapons, period.

119
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:35,790
Scott: Not like, okay, you fired that weapon, it's cooling down, but you can still go crazy with all your other weapons as much as you want.

120
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,330
Scott: No, it's like, okay, you're at like max heat.

121
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,670
Scott: If you fire anything now, you risk just exploding your whole robot.

122
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:48,550
Scott: So, of course, every BattleTech game ever has heat, because that's the core mechanic that makes it BattleTech/MechWarrior.

123
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,710
Scott: I'll just keep saying BattleTech, because it's better, even though there's a MechWarrior online.

124
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:59,410
Scott: So, they put in this thing called CoolShot, which is basically an item, a disposable item, that you can use to cool your mech off, right?

125
00:06:59,671 --> 00:07:01,930
Scott: So, almost like nitro for your heat sinks.

126
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:08,430
Scott: You press the button and your heat goes away, and you can get them and use them up, and then you're out of them, right?

127
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:18,729
Scott: So, obviously, if someone had one of these, or a few of them, they could get close to you, fire all their lasers, immediately use it and fire the lasers again, and that's pretty much going to make them win.

128
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:26,570
Scott: So, what ends up happening is, when you have that, the best design of mech ends up being something with like a million PPCs.

129
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:32,290
Rym: Oh, wow, the mech you're describing here, I'm reading that paragraph, is basically the mech I always made when we played the tabletop version.

130
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:36,529
Scott: Yeah, the ideal mech, if you have this item, is a JumpJet mech, full of PPCs.

131
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,170
Scott: You jump close to them, you fire all your PPCs, you cool down and fire them again.

132
00:07:40,451 --> 00:07:44,330
Rym: Or, back against the wall, targeting computer, two Gauss cannons, go for it.

133
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:51,530
Scott: Well, Gauss cannons don't really use heat, so, but anyway, well, they don't use that much heat, and they cool off pretty quick.

134
00:07:51,610 --> 00:08:11,810
Scott: Anyway, so, the thing is, these cool shots, to get them, it wasn't like a pickup, like quad damage and quake, you could just get them by paying fucking money, real goddamn money, real world dollars you got from your job, could be given to this company to cool down your mech and fire your PPCs twice in a row.

135
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,690
Rym: So, we talk about pay-to-win, but this is egregious pay-to-win.

136
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:26,988
Scott: This is the most egregious, I mean, sometimes I say something is pay-to-win, and people disagree with me, like maybe League of Legends or something like that, I'll say, "Yeah, it's pay-to-win, because you can't get all the possible heroes, so some people have options you don't have if you didn't

137
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:27,310
Scott: pay.".

138
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,490
Rym: But there's at least a Pareto Frontier that's pretty well designed in a lot of those cases.

139
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,688
Scott: Sure, but here, no one, no one would say, "This is not

140
00:08:36,748 --> 00:08:37,169
Scott: pay-to-win.".

141
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,840
Scott: In fact, the people who made the game said, "This is pay-to-win.

142
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,344
Scott: We're going to pay-to-win, everybody.

143
00:08:42,544 --> 00:08:43,086
Scott: Pay-to-win.

144
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:43,748
Scott: Yeah.".

145
00:08:44,831 --> 00:08:46,278
Scott: And this is the story of that.

146
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,930
Scott: Read this epic tale and learn a valuable lesson.

147
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:53,890
Scott: And when you see new games coming out, try to imagine, is that game going to be this game?

148
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,655
Scott: And if it is, do not touch.

149
00:08:56,518 --> 00:09:00,850
Scott: Not even with a 10-foot, not even with your LRMs should you touch.

150
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:03,026
Rym: LRMs go way more than 10 feet.

151
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,069
Scott: Not even with your LRMs should you touch that game.

152
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,650
Rym: Not even with your enhanced whatever claws and the muscles.

153
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:12,070
Scott: Not even with your arrow forward should you touch this game.

154
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:13,369
Scott: Or any game like it.

155
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:18,650
Rym: I remember I wanted to use sniper rifles, but we never played on big enough maps, so the Gauss rifle was just better.

156
00:09:21,231 --> 00:09:25,130
Rym: So in other gaming news, the World Cup's happening, and that's, you know, that's the thing.

157
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:25,936
Rym: People care about it.

158
00:09:25,957 --> 00:09:27,310
Rym: Not talking about soccer.

159
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,645
Scott: We've talked about soccer?

160
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:28,808
Scott: No.

161
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,130
Rym: We've talked about it a lot, and we're doing a panel at ConnectiCon.

162
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,170
Rym: We're going to talk about it again and piss some people off, because it's soccer time.

163
00:09:35,772 --> 00:09:42,049
Rym: But a historic or an-historic game just occurred a little while ago.

164
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,948
Rym: Brazil lost to Germany.

165
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:45,202
Rym: By a lot.

166
00:09:45,671 --> 00:09:46,429
Rym: In the semi-finals, right?

167
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:47,021
Scott: Yeah.

168
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,539
Rym: Yes.

169
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,044
Rym: So they didn't just lose like 1-2.

170
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,390
Scott: Like usual soccer game.

171
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,670
Rym: 0-1.

172
00:09:53,112 --> 00:09:53,694
Rym: Shootout.

173
00:09:54,035 --> 00:09:55,962
Rym: They won by 6.

174
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:56,885
Rym: The final score was 7-1.

175
00:09:59,072 --> 00:09:59,687
Rym: This game...

176
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,222
Scott: 7-1 Germany.

177
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,011
Rym: Yes.

178
00:10:01,373 --> 00:10:04,750
Rym: Was a blowout, which in soccer just doesn't happen.

179
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,529
Scott: Is a hockey score right there.

180
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,490
Rym: That's an outlier hockey score.

181
00:10:08,751 --> 00:10:09,389
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

182
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,289
Rym: That's a blowout in hockey.

183
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,950
Scott: But at least in hockey, it's like, okay, we've seen that.

184
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:14,794
Scott: The equivalent

185
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:29,222
Rym: of what happened just now between Germany and Brazil was when at RIT, a local college, in quotes, called Newman, had a hockey team that was in the same division as RIT's hockey team, and they lost a game to RIT's hockey team, and the final score was 24-0.

186
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:32,630
Scott: It was glorious.

187
00:10:33,313 --> 00:10:35,967
Rym: I think there's a phrase, and the phrase is, "You are already

188
00:10:36,027 --> 00:10:36,309
Rym: dead.".

189
00:10:37,276 --> 00:10:39,089
Scott: And they were dead after like half the first period.

190
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:45,770
Rym: So Twitter exploded, and watching this happen just through Twitter and through social media was amazing.

191
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:51,329
Rym: Someone just posted this picture of a Simpsons quote, "If they're already dead, why do you keep doing

192
00:10:51,349 --> 00:10:51,490
Rym: this?".

193
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:52,955
Scott: Yeah.

194
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,870
Scott: I was just like, hey, this is great.

195
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,187
Scott: The more boring the game, the more exciting the Twitter is.

196
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,927
Rym: But this, seriously...

197
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:06,429
Scott: Twitter makes all the social medias... If the game is too boring, people get diverted to Photoshop, and suddenly amazing things happen.

198
00:11:07,374 --> 00:11:08,490
Rym: I would not find this game boring.

199
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,049
Rym: A game like this, I'm more inclined to watch, because maybe I'm just a sadist.

200
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,389
Scott: Yeah, the beginning was really hilarious, and then after that, it's like, all right, nothing's happening now.

201
00:11:15,671 --> 00:11:17,230
Rym: Yeah, we've talked about this.

202
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,990
Rym: Remember in the game One Must Fall 2097?

203
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,769
Scott: That's a great game.

204
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,510
Rym: Yeah, well, my God, that was a great game.

205
00:11:22,811 --> 00:11:23,840
Rym: I don't know if it holds up.

206
00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:24,970
Rym: I have not played it in a long time.

207
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:29,529
Scott: It's a really... Fighting game, people wouldn't like it, and there's sort of an RPG level-up element to it.

208
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,829
Rym: Yeah, which is why we liked it.

209
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:36,190
Scott: But it's a kind of slow fighting game, but it still has all the aspects of fighting game, and the theme in music is awesome.

210
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,770
Rym: Oh, the music is some of the best music.

211
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,168
Rym: It's up there with Doom II's music.

212
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:50,970
Rym: So in One Must Fall 2097, one of the things that would happen is, you would do your Pacific Rym robot fight, whatever, and then you'd watch the newscast talking about what happened last night.

213
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:51,215
Scott: Yep.

214
00:11:51,891 --> 00:11:55,020
Rym: And sometimes it would say things like, "It was a close match.

215
00:11:55,101 --> 00:11:55,584
Rym: It was really

216
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:55,987
Rym: amazing.".

217
00:11:56,431 --> 00:12:09,969
Rym: But if it was a blowout, if you just crushed the other mech and didn't even take any damage, they always said the same thing, and they were like, "If you enjoy a fair, two-sided, interesting competition, then last night was not for you.

218
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:15,443
Rym: But if you enjoy a sadomasochistic pounding, I think I'm that

219
00:12:15,483 --> 00:12:15,706
Rym: guy.".

220
00:12:16,232 --> 00:12:19,110
Rym: I like to watch games that are ridiculous blowouts, because they tell me...

221
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,121
Scott: I like a ridiculous blowout.

222
00:12:20,162 --> 00:12:23,724
Scott: I like seeing... Like, if I had been watching from the beginning, I would have been like, "One goal.

223
00:12:23,765 --> 00:12:23,907
Scott: Ooh.

224
00:12:24,713 --> 00:12:25,256
Scott: Two goals.

225
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:25,880
Scott: Whoa.

226
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:26,543
Scott: Three goals.

227
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:26,764
Scott: Whoa.".

228
00:12:27,891 --> 00:12:29,387
Scott: And then, like, the fifth goal, I'd be like, "Oh, my

229
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:29,590
Scott: God.".

230
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,506
Scott: And then after that, it's like, "All right, we're

231
00:12:31,527 --> 00:12:31,648
Scott: done.".

232
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,710
Rym: It's got that Newman game.

233
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:38,249
Rym: When they hit 23, I would have been yelling at the top of my lungs, going for 24, with a minute left.

234
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,821
Scott: There's a different aspect there.

235
00:12:39,861 --> 00:12:40,749
Scott: We're not watching on TV.

236
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,084
Rym: True, true, true.

237
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:45,170
Scott: And the people on the ice can hear us, because it's small time.

238
00:12:46,491 --> 00:12:49,607
Scott: Those two things are necessary for me to care when the score is 23-0.

239
00:12:50,611 --> 00:13:00,470
Rym: But a score like that either means that the tournament structure was fucked, that something about the sport is fundamentally unexplored.

240
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,518
Rym: Like, there is a strategy.

241
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:04,150
Rym: There is a situation...

242
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,650
Scott: Well, Brazil's best player was injured.

243
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:06,040
Rym: Yeah.

244
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,690
Scott: That's also a factor.

245
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:08,528
Rym: Yes, it was.

246
00:13:09,111 --> 00:13:10,482
Scott: Is it a six-goal factor?

247
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:11,350
Scott: Are you losing one guy?

248
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,110
Rym: Well, that's what's interesting.

249
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:18,230
Rym: There aren't blowouts in mature games, unless those games involve extremely...

250
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:20,570
Scott: With top-tier teams playing.

251
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:31,609
Rym: Unless those games involve extremely high levels of luck, or extremely high levels of individual player input, which can translate into luck.

252
00:13:32,432 --> 00:13:41,590
Rym: And while some of those elements can be present in games like soccer, it would not translate into this unless there was something systemically wrong in the matchup between Germany and Brazil.

253
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,110
Scott: Well, I did see something recently that was very interesting.

254
00:13:44,752 --> 00:13:47,105
Scott: They talk about the good soccer players being good, right?

255
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,330
Scott: Like Messi and Ronaldo and whatever.

256
00:13:51,252 --> 00:13:56,230
Scott: And someone made a graph, and it showed goals per game or something like that.

257
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:01,490
Scott: Those two guys, when you looked at this graph, were basically miles ahead of everyone else.

258
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,886
Scott: The same way that Wayne Gretzky is miles ahead of every hockey player that will exist.

259
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:10,870
Scott: And it's sort of like, well, they really score a lot more goals than everyone else.

260
00:14:11,811 --> 00:14:12,409
Scott: Twice as many.

261
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:18,150
Rym: Like watching Michael Jordan play when he played, or watching Mike Tyson box at the height of his boxing.

262
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:27,629
Scott: Well, it's like when so few goals are scored, and you're the guy, it's like, you make a huge difference, and big number disparities like that can happen, you know?

263
00:14:28,611 --> 00:14:30,450
Rym: So, I just find this utterly amazing.

264
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:43,429
Rym: And also, as much as I bitch about soccer, nerds, sports, their games, things of the day!

265
00:14:44,152 --> 00:14:45,910
Rym: So, this is just hilarious.

266
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,310
Rym: I'm going to link to two things of the day.

267
00:14:47,571 --> 00:15:02,528
Rym: One is the original video that this is from, as in the audio and the situation that occurred with these so-called bootleg-ass fireworks shit, or fireworks bootleg-ass shit, I forget the exact order of those words, but all those words are used.

268
00:15:03,431 --> 00:15:07,690
Rym: And that is mashed up with one of the greatest movies ever made.

269
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:08,369
Scott: That's correct.

270
00:15:09,532 --> 00:15:11,430
Scott: People think I'm saying this sarcastically.

271
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,230
Scott: It's like, no, I fucking love that movie.

272
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,170
Rym: Moses, Moses, Moses.

273
00:15:16,614 --> 00:15:18,229
Scott: Let my people go.

274
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,618
Rym: It's a great movie.

275
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:22,130
Rym: It is a great work of fiction.

276
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,589
Scott: So let it be written, so let it be done.

277
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:38,189
Rym: And one would think that it might be difficult to mash up the two things that we're talking about, but this video literally made me laugh out loud at my office to the point that everyone looked over to see what the fuck I was laughing at.

278
00:15:39,332 --> 00:15:41,349
Scott: I want to make all the Ten Commandments mashups now.

279
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,765
Rym: Oh my god, we should take turns.

280
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,389
Scott: I have Creative Cloud and I'm not afraid to use it.

281
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:46,010
Scott: Yeah.

282
00:15:47,992 --> 00:15:50,430
Scott: In fact, I'm afraid not to use it, because then I feel like I'm paying for nothing.

283
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,850
Rym: Seriously, I had to use the GIMP today.

284
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,369
Rym: I haven't used the GIMP in a while.

285
00:15:56,752 --> 00:15:59,369
Rym: And I thought, oh, I'm just going to add some text layers and just...

286
00:16:04,871 --> 00:16:07,509
Scott: So it is a soccer-related thing of the day.

287
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:08,130
Scott: Uh-oh.

288
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,530
Scott: Everyday football fouls.

289
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,910
Rym: Wow, this is almost like a documentary.

290
00:16:13,192 --> 00:16:16,089
Scott: This is the most true video I've ever seen.

291
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,690
Rym: Might be too real for you guys.

292
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:18,635
Scott: It's so real.

293
00:16:19,381 --> 00:16:20,066
Scott: You gotta see this.

294
00:16:20,126 --> 00:16:20,589
Scott: It's so real.

295
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,642
Rym: We shouldn't even just watch it.

296
00:16:22,662 --> 00:16:23,250
Rym: Just watch our things today.

297
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,582
Scott: I don't know what there is to say about it.

298
00:16:24,602 --> 00:16:25,510
Scott: The title says everything.

299
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:34,190
Rym: Our things of the day are often good or bad or interesting or whatever, but seriously, today, these three videos better make you collectively laugh out loud.

300
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:35,790
Rym: Or you're not human.

301
00:16:36,272 --> 00:16:37,048
Scott: Or you're just really sad.

302
00:16:37,391 --> 00:16:43,070
Rym: In the meantime, this weekend, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday in Hartford, Connecticut...

303
00:16:43,111 --> 00:16:44,529
Scott: Well, kinda Thursday, let's be honest.

304
00:16:45,115 --> 00:16:46,110
Rym: This is a foray.

305
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,730
Rym: ConnectiCon has been growing for many years.

306
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:52,170
Rym: The quality has been stepped up in pretty much every regard.

307
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,470
Rym: And this year, it's reaching this tipping point.

308
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,130
Rym: We've spread into Thursday.

309
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,350
Rym: This is the tentacle, the little tendril going out.

310
00:16:59,571 --> 00:17:00,901
Scott: Listen, I can't take another day off work.

311
00:17:00,941 --> 00:17:02,050
Scott: Let's not spread into Thursday.

312
00:17:02,511 --> 00:17:04,025
Rym: We're going to spread full-on into Thursday.

313
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:04,530
Rym: Give it time.

314
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,396
Rym: Fuck you, Thursday.

315
00:17:05,498 --> 00:17:06,770
Scott: No one wants to go to Hartford on Thursday.

316
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:08,730
Rym: Yeah, but PAX has four days.

317
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,630
Scott: PAX is like ten Kineticons.

318
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,049
Rym: Yeah, give it time.

319
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,970
Scott: Not ten Kineticons, maybe like five, six, seven Kineticons.

320
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,337
Rym: ConnectiCon is not analogous to PAX.

321
00:17:17,357 --> 00:17:19,970
Rym: However, it is analogous to DragonCon.

322
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,989
Rym: I think ConnectiCon is going...

323
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:28,530
Scott: I don't know if it's analogous to DragonCon, but the thing they have in common is that they're the two conventions I know of that cover all the geekeries.

324
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,910
Rym: Large conventions that cover all the geekeries.

325
00:17:31,112 --> 00:17:31,290
Scott: Right.

326
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,550
Rym: Well-run conventions that cover all the geekeries.

327
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,310
Scott: Well, DragonCon is, I guess, relatively well-run.

328
00:17:35,431 --> 00:17:36,601
Scott: Well, alright.

329
00:17:36,803 --> 00:17:37,590
Rym: Well-run above...

330
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,660
Scott: I've never actually been to it.

331
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,609
Scott: I'm going by what I hear.

332
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,009
Scott: But I hear a lot about conventions, so I know more than most people.

333
00:17:44,574 --> 00:17:50,050
Rym: When we say well-run and we mean it, we basically mean PAX and, like, two other conventions.

334
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,147
Rym: But well-run in an absolute sense of...

335
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:55,470
Scott: It happens again every year without disappearing.

336
00:17:55,952 --> 00:17:56,829
Rym: Or in the sense of...

337
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,290
Scott: Without any major fiascos.

338
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:10,730
Rym: If you look at the average human being from the entire history of humans from 40,000 years ago to today, that average of capabilities, then yeah, a lot of these conventions are relatively well-run.

339
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:11,909
Scott: I mean, MAGFest still happens.

340
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,449
Rym: MAGFest still happens.

341
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,750
Scott: Yeah, but DragonCon and ConnectiCon, they're the two conventions that have all the geekeries.

342
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,221
Scott: Whatever it is, what are you into?

343
00:18:20,261 --> 00:18:21,330
Scott: What kind of geekery do you have?

344
00:18:22,212 --> 00:18:26,210
Rym: I only play Fox, Final Destination, no items.

345
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:26,613
Scott: Well, guess what?

346
00:18:26,634 --> 00:18:28,390
Scott: You can play Smash Brothers at ConnectiCon.

347
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,127
Rym: Yes, you can.

348
00:18:29,872 --> 00:18:34,610
Rym: I'm only into body art and tattoos and specialized contact lenses.

349
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,169
Scott: We have that shit at ConnectiCon.

350
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,909
Rym: We've got panels about all those things.

351
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,470
Scott: Whatever nerdy shit you're into, odds are it's at ConnectiCon somewhere.

352
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,470
Scott: The comics, the anime, whatever.

353
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,850
Scott: If there's a night of GeekNights about it, it's at ConnectiCon, except maybe tech.

354
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:48,844
Scott: I don't know how much tech we have.

355
00:18:48,905 --> 00:18:49,250
Scott: We need more.

356
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:49,575
Rym: Not yet.

357
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:50,430
Rym: I was thinking about...

358
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,729
Scott: We were actually working on it, but it wasn't easy.

359
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:53,371
Rym: Yep.

360
00:18:53,756 --> 00:18:55,070
Rym: Well, there's big changes in the backend.

361
00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:00,570
Rym: Like I said, ConnectiCon is reaching this tipping point of getting to this next level of content.

362
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,170
Rym: And next level of things being awesome.

363
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:04,469
Rym: So stay tuned.

364
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:19,410
Rym: So this year, if you want to see myths of medieval combat, parkour, an introduction, queer fandom, Kill La Kill and feminism, drawing unique characters, Sherlock Holmes through the ages, Hyrule Historia, welcome to welcome to Night Vale.

365
00:19:20,374 --> 00:19:21,809
Rym: There's a lot of shit going on.

366
00:19:22,171 --> 00:19:22,654
Scott: That's funny.

367
00:19:22,714 --> 00:19:25,610
Scott: The name of the thing starts with welcome to, so then they added a welcome to.

368
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:32,069
Rym: You realize when I saw that title, I basically decided unless there was something egregious in the description, I was scheduling it no matter what.

369
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,390
Rym: And then I read the description and it looks great.

370
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:38,809
Scott: Whoever made the panel is clever enough to make the title, so they're clever enough to be panelists.

371
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:46,070
Rym: When I look at these submissions, I pretty much think, are these people doing the kinds of things that we do to other conventions?

372
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:47,386
Rym: If so, second look.

373
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,710
Rym: So yeah, ConnectiCon this weekend is going to be fucking awesome.

374
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:53,010
Rym: Also, we're doing a bunch of panels.

375
00:19:53,411 --> 00:19:55,809
Scott: Mostly because a few people bailed and we had to fill in.

376
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,067
Scott: So our schedule started at like two panels and is now.

377
00:19:59,107 --> 00:19:59,450
Scott: how many?

378
00:20:00,852 --> 00:20:03,950
Rym: Four, five if you count the Date Naito panel that I'm going to be on.

379
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,630
Scott: But if you count morning announcement panel.

380
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:10,130
Rym: If we count morning announcements and all the convention run panels, like con feedback.

381
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:16,210
Rym: I'm not adding the ConnectiCon convention feedback panel to our resume of panels that we've run over the years.

382
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:16,754
Scott: You sure?

383
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:17,890
Scott: I'm going to make this one exciting.

384
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:18,808
Rym: Are you?

385
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:19,071
Scott: Yeah.

386
00:20:19,091 --> 00:20:20,559
Scott: I'm just going to cuss out all the attendees.

387
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,610
Scott: Be like, all right, this panel is actually reversed this year.

388
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:23,798
Scott: Feedback for the attendees.

389
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,210
Scott: Your cosplay is awful.

390
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:26,790
Scott: You were annoying.

391
00:20:28,252 --> 00:20:29,282
Scott: You didn't pay for your badge.

392
00:20:29,302 --> 00:20:30,150
Scott: What are you complaining about?

393
00:20:31,012 --> 00:20:42,210
Rym: If I was making a TV show and I was the writer for it about conventions and people who run them, that scene, after you do your rant, you do your crazy rant, or I guess the actor who's playing you.

394
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,168
Scott: You're that guy.

395
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,935
Scott: I wish you did something.

396
00:20:44,975 --> 00:20:47,750
Scott: I actually sort of wish you did something bad at this convention so I could ban you.

397
00:20:47,951 --> 00:20:50,382
Rym: I would have the guy who plays house play you.

398
00:20:50,402 --> 00:20:51,930
Rym: You would do the rant.

399
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:59,010
Rym: And then there'd be like a mope, one of those awkward office style, the office style moments of silence as everyone in the room is just aghast.

400
00:20:59,331 --> 00:21:05,010
Rym: And then one attendee would raise their hand and be like, I have some feedback about the convention feedback panel.

401
00:21:05,455 --> 00:21:06,569
Rym: And that would be when the scene would end.

402
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:07,296
Rym: Shut the fuck up.

403
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:10,009
Scott: Black rage.

404
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:10,848
Scott: Say what again?

405
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:11,507
Scott: Black rage.

406
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:12,729
Scott: Say what again?

407
00:21:13,211 --> 00:21:15,029
Rym: All right, we're mixing our links and metaphors here.

408
00:21:15,711 --> 00:21:17,319
Rym: The Book Club book is a Canada club for LeewaWits.

409
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,530
Rym: I read it a long goddamn time ago, Scott.

410
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,390
Scott: I would read it in the car to Connecticut, but I get carsick if I read it in the car.

411
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:27,870
Rym: So do I. In fact, I get carsick reading my phone in a cab ride to JFK.

412
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:28,412
Rym: You know what?

413
00:21:28,814 --> 00:21:29,878
Scott: That's what happened to me.

414
00:21:29,918 --> 00:21:32,630
Scott: I was in cars this weekend because I was in Connecticut.

415
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:33,610
Rym: And you were bored.

416
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,470
Scott: I read my phone in the car and then I got carsick and I was like, fuck.

417
00:21:37,131 --> 00:21:40,902
Scott: And the worst part is- If it was a book, I would have known, don't read that book.

418
00:21:41,284 --> 00:21:42,570
Scott: But it was a phone, so I read it.

419
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,368
Scott: And then it's just like, ah!

420
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:47,070
Rym: Telling someone like us, don't look at your phone is like saying, yeah, don't open your left eye.

421
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,709
Rym: Just keep that shit shut.

422
00:21:48,971 --> 00:21:50,229
Scott: And I'm sitting in a boring car.

423
00:21:52,491 --> 00:21:55,850
Rym: And I can't play my 3DS because I've basically beat all the games I own out of it.

424
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,877
Rym: You get pie-cross.

425
00:21:57,159 --> 00:21:58,126
Scott: They already came out of the pie-cross E4.

426
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,390
Scott: You never run out of pie-cross.

427
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,670
Rym: I don't understand you and pie-cross.

428
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,689
Rym: Have you ever done a show on pie-cross?

429
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:15,864
Scott: You might as well also mix in Sudoku, crossword, word search- Should we do a show on- And uh, tangram- no, not tangram.

430
00:22:15,884 --> 00:22:16,950
Scott: Tangrams are the triangle things.

431
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:23,070
Scott: Anagram, cryptogram, and all those other things in the themes magazine.

432
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:27,490
Rym: After ConnectiCon, our next convention will be PAX Dev, PAX Prime.

433
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:31,630
Scott: For all of like the rest of July and August, we've pretty much got nothing.

434
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:32,429
Rym: You know what that means?

435
00:22:33,113 --> 00:22:34,650
Rym: Lot of streaming and gaming.

436
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,330
Scott: Lot of gaming while biking and whatnot.

437
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,450
Rym: But also lots of Geeknight's video coming back.

438
00:22:39,731 --> 00:22:47,650
Rym: The only other meta moment I'll point out, if you like the anime Shoujo Kakumei Utena, We've done the entire first goddamn season of that thing in terms of reviews.

439
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,770
Rym: It's all on YouTube and it's awesome.

440
00:22:50,432 --> 00:22:52,870
Scott: And if you like that, Sailor Moon is back.

441
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:56,469
Rym: Sailor Moon is back and we're gonna be talking- If you don't watch it, I'll punish you.

442
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,525
Rym: We're gonna be talking about Sailor Moon Oshiokyo.

443
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:02,129
Rym: A tsukimi kawate oshiokyo?

444
00:23:02,471 --> 00:23:03,669
Scott: No, in the name of something else.

445
00:23:04,131 --> 00:23:04,910
Rym: In the name of what?

446
00:23:05,776 --> 00:23:06,088
Scott: I don't know.

447
00:23:06,914 --> 00:23:08,648
Rym: What would you punish someone in the name of?

448
00:23:09,678 --> 00:23:10,150
Scott: Your mom.

449
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:16,569
Scott: Your mom sent me here to punish you, smack.

450
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:27,290
Rym: So, pretty much if I had to rank Zelda games in terms of me enjoying them, Of all the Zelda games that have ever been made, my list is actually very straightforward.

451
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,289
Scott: Oh, let's do the list then.

452
00:23:28,794 --> 00:23:29,190
Scott: Alright, alright.

453
00:23:29,453 --> 00:23:30,230
Scott: And then I'll do my list.

454
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:30,948
Rym: Alright, my list.

455
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,950
Rym: Number one, Zelda 3.

456
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:33,350
Scott: There you go.

457
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,248
Rym: Best Zelda game ever.

458
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,348
Scott: Can't go wrong with that.

459
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,748
Rym: Number two, I'm gonna say Four Swords.

460
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:39,656
Scott: Really?

461
00:23:40,191 --> 00:23:44,290
Rym: Because that experience is transcendent if you do it right.

462
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,180
Scott: However- We're talking about GameCube.

463
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,010
Scott: Four Swords, obviously.

464
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,109
Scott: Because there's some other Four Swords out there.

465
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:55,890
Rym: However, I will not actually put that on the list as number two because that's like saying Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles is a great game.

466
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,629
Rym: No, that is a great chance at having a great game.

467
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:05,650
Rym: So, my number two would be Zelda 1, my number three would be Zelda 2, and I never really- You and your Zelda 2.

468
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,270
Rym: Yeah, Zelda 2 is fucking awesome.

469
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,130
Scott: You and your Zelda 2.

470
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:08,291
Scott: Look,

471
00:24:08,553 --> 00:24:10,949
Rym: of all the twos that suck in the world-

472
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,082
Scott: You also like Castlevania 2, so-

473
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:23,749
Rym: No, I appreciate Castlevania 2, and I like it in the same way that I like pain because it reminds me that I'm alive, but I'm not going to pretend that Castlevania 2 is a great game.

474
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:29,201
Rym: So, it's Zelda 3, Zelda 1, Zelda 2, don't really like the 3D Zeldas that much.

475
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,260
Scott: Alright, so for me, Zelda 1, best Zelda.

476
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:36,267
Scott: Why?

477
00:24:37,314 --> 00:24:38,850
Scott: Just because Zelda 1.

478
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,325
Scott: That graveyard going on, mmm.

479
00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:42,430
Rym: There's a graveyard in Zelda 3.

480
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:45,190
Scott: Yeah, but it's like in Zelda 1, that graveyard is like mystical shit.

481
00:24:45,231 --> 00:24:45,728
Scott: Yeah, you know why?

482
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:48,730
Rym: Because that palette was scary as shit when you were a kid.

483
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,689
Scott: Yeah, and when you go in the final dungeon, it's like the music going on.

484
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:58,450
Scott: Let me just say, Zelda 1 is the only Zelda that can give you the feels, right?

485
00:24:58,592 --> 00:24:59,070
Scott: Even today.

486
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,109
Scott: It's not like because I was a kid.

487
00:25:00,331 --> 00:25:01,750
Scott: No, that shit's still scary as fuck.

488
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:07,420
Rym: Anyway- Zelda 3 gave me those feels when I hit the dark world, and I was like, "Oh, oh, oh, there's like seven more

489
00:25:07,481 --> 00:25:07,904
Rym: dungeons.".

490
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:12,111
Scott: Anyway, Zelda, next one, Zelda 3.

491
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:15,290
Scott: And then, Zelda 64, because, you know, Ocarina's.

492
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:16,066
Scott: Yeah.

493
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,229
Scott: Then- I think it's Ocarina.

494
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,830
Scott: The one you didn't play, Wind Fish, Game Boy Zelda.

495
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,470
Rym: Oh, yeah, I should beat that game.

496
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:23,889
Scott: Game Boy Zelda, Wind Fish.

497
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:25,770
Rym: That's probably a good one.

498
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,249
Scott: I did not particularly- Then maybe Zelda 2 after that.

499
00:25:28,491 --> 00:25:30,470
Rym: I didn't particularly enjoy Seasons or Ages.

500
00:25:31,412 --> 00:25:32,589
Scott: Minish Cat was a joke.

501
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:37,350
Scott: Wind Waker and Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword are sort of all equal.

502
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,829
Scott: They're boring as fuck.

503
00:25:39,213 --> 00:25:39,730
Rym: I'm sorry.

504
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:40,410
Scott: They're all equal.

505
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,070
Scott: They all come below Zelda 2.

506
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,788
Rym: I enjoyed the lore.

507
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:50,510
Scott: I guess Wind Waker is like, it's better in some ways game-wise, but it's worse because it has the stupid Triforce hunting, and it doesn't have enough dungeons.

508
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,630
Scott: I base Zelda solely on the number of dungeons.

509
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:53,409
Scott: And actually, you know what?

510
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:57,029
Scott: Of the three, I'm going to put Twilight Princess slightly ahead of the other two.

511
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,609
Rym: Twilight Princess did have enough dungeons.

512
00:25:58,831 --> 00:26:06,950
Scott: Because it had enough-ish dungeons, but mostly because the one awesome ancient Hyrule dungeon hidden in the woods where it's like, here's all this ancient Hyrulean shit.

513
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:07,336
Rym: Ooh.

514
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,830
Rym: Oh, you love that precursor stuff.

515
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,589
Rym: That's why you like Samus games so much.

516
00:26:10,831 --> 00:26:11,210
Scott: That's right.

517
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:16,510
Scott: It's a very Metroid- It was very Chozo statue in that area, which is why it was dope as hell.

518
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:23,310
Rym: Guys, if you want to get me and Scott excited about things, the term to remember is, quote, precursor technology.

519
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,207
Scott: Matt Cross.

520
00:26:27,015 --> 00:26:27,988
Rym: Can it go for Liebowitz?

521
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:28,909
Scott: Star Control.

522
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:30,790
Rym: The culture.

523
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,370
Scott: Anyway, that's my Zelda ranking.

524
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:39,010
Scott: So, of course, here comes Zelda Link Between Worlds.

525
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,890
Rym: Which is attempted to be a remake of Zelda 3.

526
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:49,089
Scott: Okay, so when I first saw Link Between Worlds, it was like, oh, they're remaking Super Nintendo Zelda 3, which is the second one on the list.

527
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:54,609
Scott: But they had already re-released it on GBA or whatever, and I'm just like, well, why?

528
00:26:55,011 --> 00:26:56,250
Scott: Why are they re-releasing it again?

529
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:56,785
Scott: I don't get it.

530
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,750
Scott: But then they're like, no, it's actually a new game.

531
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,810
Scott: And I'm like, oh, it's actually a new game.

532
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:05,070
Scott: It's just like, you know, very similar to Zelda 3.

533
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:11,010
Rym: It's set in a similar-ish world, which is interesting because I'll go to places where I remember secrets, and there'll be a different secret in that area.

534
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:11,283
Rym: Yeah.

535
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:12,710
Rym: Or usually no secrets.

536
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:23,008
Scott: Basically, it's like, I wish they would have just taken the same engine and made a new game, which they sort of did, but they also used the same map and had two worlds on that map.

537
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:28,750
Rym: The second world, however, was kind of ghetto compared to the dark world in Zelda 3.

538
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:28,840
Rym: Yeah.

539
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,670
Rym: Because it was basically a bunch of discontinuous zones.

540
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,550
Scott: Right, but the big thing- You couldn't really explore.

541
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,910
Scott: Yeah, but they did add a bunch of new Zelda mechanics.

542
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:40,964
Scott: Mostly, the big one is the one where you turn flat and go on the wall, which is 3DS style, right?

543
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,030
Scott: They had to do 3D something.

544
00:27:42,511 --> 00:27:45,130
Rym: The other thing that they did is, elevation actually matters a lot.

545
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:45,499
Rym: Yeah.

546
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,230
Rym: To the point that if you turn off the 3D, some of the puzzles are really hard.

547
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:53,790
Scott: In some places, the elevation is cool, and some places, it's annoying that you have elevation.

548
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:56,049
Rym: Yeah, but the fact is, it matters for some of the puzzles.

549
00:27:56,235 --> 00:27:56,467
Scott: Yes.

550
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:01,770
Rym: Which at least, it was an attempt to use Nintendo's most recent gimmick bullshit.

551
00:28:02,596 --> 00:28:03,310
Scott: Oh, the 3D screen?

552
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:03,559
Scott: Yeah.

553
00:28:06,392 --> 00:28:10,430
Rym: But as much as I enjoyed this game, I have never died.

554
00:28:12,838 --> 00:28:13,429
Scott: Did I die?

555
00:28:14,312 --> 00:28:16,030
Scott: I may have died just fooling around.

556
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,870
Scott: If I tried really hard, I probably could have completely avoided dying.

557
00:28:18,952 --> 00:28:27,330
Scott: Yeah, well, one- Have you gone to that weird place in the top right-ish area with the falling thing, where you got to go this sort of platformy underground?

558
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,030
Scott: That place is a little annoying.

559
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,730
Rym: Well, I died a couple times, but I had fairies with me, so it didn't matter.

560
00:28:33,139 --> 00:28:33,328
Scott: Oh, okay.

561
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:40,204
Rym: But I never at any point, playing this game, fighting a boss, fighting a mini boss, going through an area- Oh, hell.

562
00:28:40,245 --> 00:28:40,368
Scott: no.

563
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,347
Rym: Even felt for a second like, "I wonder if I'll run out of

564
00:28:43,407 --> 00:28:43,689
Rym: hearts.".

565
00:28:44,853 --> 00:28:46,770
Rym: I never bought a potion either, because fuck potions.

566
00:28:46,911 --> 00:28:47,649
Rym: I never needed one.

567
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,609
Scott: You just keep your bottles sold with fairies or whatever.

568
00:28:50,951 --> 00:28:52,590
Rym: Yeah, you scoop up five bottles.

569
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,349
Scott: Scoop them up with your net, and you'll be all good.

570
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,568
Rym: Yeah, five bottles.

571
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:55,982
Rym: Yep.

572
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:59,590
Rym: Bottles were more important than heart containers in Zelda 3.

573
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,629
Scott: And now they let you have five of them.

574
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:00,960
Scott: Yeah.

575
00:29:01,255 --> 00:29:01,407
Scott: Yeah.

576
00:29:01,731 --> 00:29:03,970
Rym: And you get one of them just by dumping a bunch of money into that fountain.

577
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:11,009
Scott: Dude, there was one item in this game that you get just by talking to a dude in town, the Pegasus boot, I think.

578
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:11,295
Scott: Yeah.

579
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:16,549
Scott: And it's like, I didn't get it for so long, because I didn't realize it was so easy to get, but it's just like, just sneak up behind the dude and you get it.

580
00:29:16,862 --> 00:29:16,989
Rym: Yup.

581
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:17,569
Rym: I didn't realize.

582
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:22,592
Rym: I thought, because I remembered getting them a different way, and I didn't think ...

583
00:29:22,592 --> 00:29:24,650
Scott: I was like, "Man, what dungeon am I getting the Pegasus boot in?

584
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,325
Scott: I could really use

585
00:29:25,366 --> 00:29:25,407
Scott: it.".

586
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,090
Scott: I could have gotten it the whole time.

587
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,970
Rym: The whole game was like, "Oh, I could knock that thing off.

588
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:29,970
Rym: I could knock that thing off.

589
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:30,478
Rym: This is really

590
00:29:30,499 --> 00:29:30,947
Rym: slow.".

591
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:31,347
Scott: Yeah.

592
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:33,666
Rym: It was interesting.

593
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,550
Rym: So, they had that weird mechanic where you could rent items.

594
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,950
Rym: So, basically, I had infinite rupees for the entire game.

595
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:40,770
Scott: Well, that is one interesting thing.

596
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:45,410
Scott: Usually, a Zelda game makes you do the dungeons in order, but here, they don't make you do the dungeons in order.

597
00:29:46,013 --> 00:29:53,590
Scott: You can go to any dungeon that's accessible that you want, but you might need a certain item for the dungeon, so you can go rent it for rupees, and that's kind of good, because they made rupees matter.

598
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:56,770
Scott: In other Zeldas, if you would buy everything you could buy, then rupees meant dick.

599
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,470
Rym: But, they only matter if you die frequently.

600
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:00,108
Scott: Yes.

601
00:30:00,871 --> 00:30:05,550
Scott: And it's like, eventually, you just literally outright buy every item in the shop trivially.

602
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:05,988
Scott: Why bother?

603
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,270
Rym: It's not like you're going to die.

604
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:10,770
Scott: Well, eventually, you know, I think in the other world, you can't rent the item.

605
00:30:10,912 --> 00:30:11,349
Scott: I don't remember.

606
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:11,802
Rym: Why?

607
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:12,790
Rym: I never lose the item.

608
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:13,310
Rym: It doesn't matter.

609
00:30:13,516 --> 00:30:14,029
Scott: I don't remember.

610
00:30:14,755 --> 00:30:15,930
Scott: I played it longer ago than you.

611
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:16,588
Scott: You're playing it now.

612
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:21,929
Scott: But, yeah, I just outright bought every item really trivially, because there were so many rupees, and they were easy to get, and then that was that.

613
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:33,870
Rym: So, I guess, my trouble is, but it's a complicated problem, because this game is not a good game for me, but it's a good game for other people, so I got to harp on the things that I think are just bad design, or are Zelda going in a bad direction?

614
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:51,090
Scott: Well, the one bad thing, right, was because you can go to the dungeons in any order, right, just choosing the right item that belongs to that dungeon, what ends up happening is all of the dungeons that are on the same tier are equal difficulty, but your link, you're getting more heart containers, and you're getting more sword power, and whatever you're getting.

615
00:30:51,550 --> 00:31:08,789
Scott: So, like, the first dungeon is actually kind of difficult, no matter which one you pick, but then every other dungeon after that gets trivially easy, because it's like all the dungeons are, like, the level two dungeon, as opposed to in Zelda one, like, if you walked right into the level eight dungeon at the beginning of the game, you were dead.

616
00:31:09,216 --> 00:31:09,449
Rym: Yup.

617
00:31:09,851 --> 00:31:18,110
Scott: I mean, sometimes I'd go in there just to, like- You're going to fight those blue sword dudes with your sword, and maybe some bomb, like How many bombs do you have?

618
00:31:18,236 --> 00:31:18,408
Rym: Eight.

619
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,230
Scott: Four bomb.

620
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:24,090
Scott: You're going to use four bomb and sword on a room full of blue sword guys.

621
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,010
Scott: Good luck, my friend.

622
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,310
Rym: Wasn't that a challenge at Magfest?

623
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,910
Rym: You're dumped in with half a heart in a blue sword room?

624
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:29,667
Scott: Good luck.

625
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,028
Scott: I forget.

626
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,269
Scott: What are those guys' names again?

627
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:32,330
Rym: Darknut.

628
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:43,370
Scott: Yeah, you have blue darknuts, room full of them, and the things that are shooting at you in the corners, and you don't have the magic shield, and you only have sword, and you only have four bombs, yeah, it's not going to happen.

629
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:47,829
Scott: But in this one, that basically doesn't exist, because all the dungeons in the same tier are equal difficulty.

630
00:31:47,951 --> 00:31:48,648
Rym: Here's what bothered me.

631
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:54,850
Rym: One, the items are not really used too intrinsically in the dungeons themselves.

632
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:57,350
Rym: They're just used at the entrance to keep you out.

633
00:31:57,451 --> 00:31:57,748
Scott: Sometimes.

634
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,050
Rym: Yeah, most of the time.

635
00:32:00,091 --> 00:32:03,030
Scott: Usually that weapon is the most effective thing against the boss of the dungeon.

636
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:07,290
Rym: Yeah, but I've found that all the items are really effective against all the bosses in most cases.

637
00:32:07,391 --> 00:32:12,270
Rym: I mean, that fire rod, I use that to kill most of the bosses, because it's just a fuck ton of damage and goes through a lot of their blocks.

638
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:26,550
Rym: So my problem is, you use a particular item to get in every dungeon, you can just buy that item for a trivial amount of rupees and just have it with you, no matter what, and they don't even make you figure it out.

639
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:35,430
Rym: They have an icon that shows you which item you even need to get in, and they explain what all the icons are in detail multiple times.

640
00:32:35,732 --> 00:32:37,730
Scott: Hey, Link, this item does this.

641
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:38,769
Scott: Mega Man, Mega Man!

642
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:50,750
Rym: So whereas, here would be a cool puzzle, where that guy's like, hey, check out that windmill over there, and you know that's where your bullshit is, so then you figure out, how can I get the door open on this windmill?

643
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,169
Scott: Maybe with the wind item?

644
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:55,330
Rym: Yeah, maybe if I make some windmill, oh hey, it worked.

645
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:58,930
Rym: No, instead there's just an icon of the wind item there in case you're a moron.

646
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:12,589
Scott: So you want it to be basically, if it's just a windmill and there's a wind item, it'll be so easy that anyone but the dumbest kid could figure it out trivially, but you want it to be even easier to where literally anyone who's literate will get it right.

647
00:33:13,672 --> 00:33:16,130
Scott: And to top it off-- Third grade reading level, anyone.

648
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:16,391
Scott: So

649
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,495
Rym: in the dungeons,

650
00:33:17,535 --> 00:33:17,756
Scott: because

651
00:33:17,776 --> 00:33:32,709
Rym: you rent bombs, you have unlimited bombs all the time, which means finding secrets is trivial, there aren't that many secrets, and every time you need a bomb for anything that matters, there's always an infinitely respawning monster that drops a bomb every time you kill him.

652
00:33:33,532 --> 00:33:36,170
Scott: That way you can't possibly get trapped in a dungeon.

653
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:41,689
Rym: Except you can't get trapped by that, you just would have to go rent the bombs again if you die.

654
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:47,590
Scott: You'd have to go all the way, if you get to a place where you need a bomb and you don't have one, you might have to go all the way back to get one.

655
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,909
Rym: Yeah, like in every other Zelda game.

656
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:55,369
Scott: Right, this way, it's like, well, no matter where you are, you won't have to backtrack 100 miles and come back again.

657
00:33:55,690 --> 00:34:07,888
Rym: But thus, renting the bombs feels pointless, and two, the monster you kill is always right next to the puzzle you need to use a bomb for, so you don't even have to figure out the puzzle.

658
00:34:09,391 --> 00:34:12,806
Scott: And three, while the game- I think you're underestimating how dumb people are.

659
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:16,170
Scott: These people, if they played Zelda 1, would have no fucking clue what to do.

660
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:17,949
Rym: I've watched people play Zelda 1 and have no clue.

661
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:21,349
Scott: You remember PAX, those were gamers, people dedicated enough to gaming to go to PAX.

662
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:33,870
Scott: They hadn't played Zelda 1 before, and they were under pressure on a stage, but still, they needed someone to tell them what to do on a fact, and Penny Arcade realized this and provided it in advance, knowing that that would be a problem.

663
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:35,489
Rym: So this is the problem.

664
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:49,949
Rym: It seems like Zelda games are aimed at basically children or people who haven't built a lot of skill in basically any game even close to this genre, but simultaneously, they're removing even the basic parts of the puzzles.

665
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:54,929
Rym: So you can't fail, and there's almost nothing to figure out.

666
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:58,169
Rym: The solution to every puzzle in every dungeon is right there.

667
00:34:59,033 --> 00:35:04,107
Rym: You can brute force every puzzle, just get flat and walk in every direction, see a rupee on the wall?

668
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,188
Rym: That's the direction to go.

669
00:35:05,911 --> 00:35:06,947
Scott: Here's the thing I don't get, right?

670
00:35:07,751 --> 00:35:12,210
Scott: We gotta presume they're making it easy and accessible to get the widest possible audience, Which is fine.

671
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:16,210
Scott: The dumbest person who's playing this game is some little kid who plays Pokemon.

672
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:20,310
Scott: That kid can figure out fucking Pokemon, he can figure out fucking Zelda.

673
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:24,070
Rym: That kid was EV training before they made that an obvious part of the game.

674
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:24,889
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

675
00:35:25,813 --> 00:35:27,850
Scott: Those kids figured out fucking the first Pokemon.

676
00:35:29,352 --> 00:35:32,169
Scott: They can figure out the newer Pokemon, which has even more shit going on.

677
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,290
Scott: They can figure out Zelda without the hand holding.

678
00:35:35,151 --> 00:35:37,770
Rym: Meanwhile, look at another type of games, all the Metroidvanias.

679
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:50,109
Rym: Those games, I had a similar problem with because I really like those games, but I get really good at them, so then when a new one came out, the beginning was ridiculously easy and pointless before you got to the good parts.

680
00:35:51,010 --> 00:36:07,435
Rym: So if Nintendo made Zelda games more and more difficult, they're only chasing the expert gamers, so instead they're making them easier and easier, but like Scott alluded to, I don't know who they're going after.

681
00:36:07,455 --> 00:36:11,849
Rym: who doesn't already like Zelda games by taking the games even a notch lower.

682
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,206
Scott: I think really the thing that disappoints me the most is the better.

683
00:36:15,266 --> 00:36:17,510
Scott: Zelda games are usually the ones that are bigger, right?

684
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,790
Scott: The more, the better.

685
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:21,010
Scott: Same thing with Metroidvanias, the bigger the better.

686
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:26,190
Scott: Look at Symphony of the Night, fucking upside down castle, playing it twice shit going on, right?

687
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:35,950
Rym: Yup, and remember the original design of the original Legend of Zelda came out of the idea that I was a kid wandering around in the forest, and I wanted to recreate that experience.

688
00:36:37,551 --> 00:36:46,101
Rym: Zelda's 1, 2, and 3 had a lot of exploration, and increasingly Zelda games, especially even this one, pretty much railroad you into.

689
00:36:46,362 --> 00:36:48,350
Rym: here's a box, and inside this box is a puzzle.

690
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:54,710
Scott: I think that's what they were going for in Link Between Worlds, was letting you go all over the map right away, any dungeon you want.

691
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:58,010
Rym: Except then they portioned off the Dark Zone, so there's no exploration.

692
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:03,329
Rym: There's almost no sense of discovery in the game, it just gives you a checkbox of...

693
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,989
Scott: Well, you can't discover anything on a map that you've known your whole life.

694
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,630
Scott: Yeah, but they changed a bunch of things.

695
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:14,109
Scott: Imagine playing, if you played this and you had never played the SNES Zelda 3, you're discovering the whole thing because you don't know this map.

696
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:22,029
Scott: Exactly, but even if I were discovering the whole thing, because of the way the maps designed It's like you have Zeke at your house, of course it's less fun for people who know your house like you.

697
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:27,990
Rym: But even if I'd never played a Zelda game before, the map is so small, and the puzzles are so telegraphed.

698
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,750
Scott: It's the same size map as your favorite Zelda.

699
00:37:30,031 --> 00:37:30,628
Scott: It's the same map.

700
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:31,710
Scott: How is it small?

701
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,110
Rym: Because that one was more interconnected.

702
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:39,950
Rym: In the dark world, you could walk in a lot of different directions, a lot of different paths, there's a lot of kind of weird stuff hanging around.

703
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:46,268
Rym: In this one, they've kind of walled off every section, and they even put them into separate sections on the map.

704
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,810
Rym: And you can't walk between those sections at all.

705
00:37:50,511 --> 00:38:08,250
Scott: What I really just want to see is someone make a Zelda 2 top-down game or Metroidvania, where the thing is so big, and the difficulty continues to scale exponentially, to where you don't feel you get ripped off when you didn't beat it, because you still played it for like a zillion hours until you got to the spot where you couldn't get past.

706
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:10,730
Rym: Oh, so then the game is just how far did you get?

707
00:38:10,911 --> 00:38:26,250
Scott: Yeah, it's how far did you get, and only the most badasses of the video game world will actually beat it, and the slightly less badass will get to the final boss and die, and the slightly less badass might get to the last level, and the difficulty just keeps scaling all the way up, right?

708
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:37,630
Scott: And it's like, everyone's going to get really far, because it's so big, you're going to get at least a full Zelda game into the game, like 14 dungeons or whatever, something ridiculous like that, but the game has like 30 dungeons.

709
00:38:38,351 --> 00:38:43,030
Rym: Oh, tons of NPCs saying a bunch of useless shit constantly that you can't skip.

710
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,850
Scott: That's in every Zelda game ever.

711
00:38:45,351 --> 00:38:46,350
Rym: Zelda 1?

712
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:46,570
Scott: Yes.

713
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,970
Rym: They don't, that takes two seconds, they don't say it again.

714
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:53,470
Scott: The dark no-dislike smoke, you can't leave the room while I am typing it very slowly.

715
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:53,901
Rym: Yes.

716
00:38:54,770 --> 00:39:00,630
Scott: That does not bother me nearly as much as- Pay me rupees and I'll tell you something completely useless that you can't leave the room while I'm saying.

717
00:39:00,812 --> 00:39:01,990
Scott: Oh, and you lost some rupees.

718
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:08,570
Rym: I'm a sage, let me give you all this lore that has literally no bearing on the game, because you're just going to go do these check boxes.

719
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,109
Scott: People really care about the Zelda lore for some reason.

720
00:39:11,591 --> 00:39:17,530
Scott: I know, I know, and I just- Even though it's the exact same lore, every single game, get all them sages, then beat Ganon.

721
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:22,259
Scott: I just don't care anymore, like the lore- Hey guys, pro tip, at the end of the game, Ganon.

722
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:28,370
Rym: The lore is so unsubtle, and honestly, pretty badly written in this game.

723
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:31,490
Scott: It's the same lore that they've had since SNES Zelda.

724
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,628
Scott: But the wording.

725
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,769
Scott: They repeated that one lore every time.

726
00:39:35,191 --> 00:39:49,090
Rym: The way they- The little details about where the different sages went, and oh, this guy, someone rented my sand, whatever, and I wonder what happened to him, and the witch disappearing, and then you figure out she's a sage, because they show you a picture.

727
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:51,650
Rym: They don't let you figure anything out on your own.

728
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:57,290
Rym: Everything you could figure out, even stuff about the lore, they tell you immediately in multiple ways.

729
00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:03,608
Rym: There is no chance to miss any of the little subtle details that they could have just left undescribed.

730
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:07,150
Rym: The game is unsubtle, if I had to describe it every word.

731
00:40:07,293 --> 00:40:08,108
Scott: Every modern game?

732
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,530
Scott: What game that's new to subtle?

733
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:11,930
Scott: For any platform, any- FTL.

734
00:40:12,672 --> 00:40:13,290
Scott: How is it subtle?

735
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:24,090
Rym: The combinatorial complexity and the surprising interactions of different weapons and strategies makes very subtle and nuanced strategies interesting.

736
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:25,748
Scott: What about the lore of FTL?

737
00:40:26,152 --> 00:40:26,730
Scott: How is it subtle?

738
00:40:27,651 --> 00:40:29,630
Rym: Have you actually played the advanced game at all?

739
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:30,168
Scott: No.

740
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:38,590
Rym: There's lots of little side dramas going on, and you can figure out a lot of interesting stuff about, like, which races are interacting with whom and what's going on in these parts of space.

741
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:40,109
Scott: Rock man is love fanfic.

742
00:40:43,391 --> 00:40:53,709
Rym: Actually, you know what, Deus Ex Human Revolution had a lot of interesting, subtle lore that didn't get in your way, and they didn't go out of their way to say, "Hey, hey, check out this clever thing we did, like a Zelda game does.

743
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:54,488
Rym: Look right here.

744
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:57,466
Rym: This is the tiny, clever thing we did, in case you missed

745
00:40:57,506 --> 00:40:57,547
Rym: it.".

746
00:40:58,454 --> 00:40:59,689
Rym: In that game, it's just there.

747
00:41:00,072 --> 00:41:03,210
Rym: If you notice that guy looks like that other guy, well, that's interesting.

748
00:41:05,191 --> 00:41:15,609
Rym: I wonder, it's almost like the creators are afraid that you'll miss some little piece that they thought of, that they thought was clever, so they gotta have arrows and fingers pointing at everything they thought of to make sure you know how clever they were.

749
00:41:17,571 --> 00:41:22,350
Rym: I don't know, I'm just, I was surprisingly unsatisfied by the game.

750
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:26,130
Scott: There's a reason it's not video game season and hasn't been for a while.

751
00:41:26,231 --> 00:41:29,010
