00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,997
Rym: It's Tuesday July 18th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,579 --> 00:00:18,240
Rym: tonight We talk about that old standby and German style gaming settlers of Catan.

3
00:00:18,742 --> 00:00:23,640
Rym: Also geek back about arcade games and some talk of the new steam games coming out.

4
00:00:25,402 --> 00:00:28,184
Scott: Let's do this Now.

5
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:30,560
Rym: I'm normally not one to complain about the heat.

6
00:00:30,881 --> 00:00:33,651
Rym: I mean I like it when it's really really hot in the summer.

7
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:36,200
Rym: You know hot and humid and miserable for everyone else.

8
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:41,498
Scott: Well, I like it when the weather is you know not too hot not too cold just right.

9
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:48,560
Scott: but After having lived in Rochester for many many moons, and you you mean the ice planet fucking Hoth.

10
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:55,829
Scott: You mean Hoth - Hoth - and after living there for quite a while I do prefer you know more Sun.

11
00:00:55,849 --> 00:00:58,680
Scott: I would rather die in a fire than die in an ice cave.

12
00:00:59,222 --> 00:01:00,607
Rym: I just generally like it hot.

13
00:01:00,748 --> 00:01:01,450
Rym: I mean the summers.

14
00:01:01,551 --> 00:01:02,515
Scott: I grew up like it hot.

15
00:01:03,257 --> 00:01:03,960
Rym: It's a great movie.

16
00:01:04,301 --> 00:01:05,887
Rym: We're actually a lot hotter than the summers.

17
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:06,610
Rym: I experienced.

18
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:12,718
Rym: You know in Rochester and living down here, but Today it was a special brand of hot.

19
00:01:13,622 --> 00:01:21,831
Rym: now I'm at work, and it's really really hot and the air conditioning is barely keeping up and You know I poke around in the weather to see if there's a thunderstorm or anything coming.

20
00:01:22,173 --> 00:01:23,398
Rym: and I see that for beacon.

21
00:01:23,518 --> 00:01:32,460
Rym: well first of all Driving into work there were big signs Everywhere warning people that there was an ozone alert and that you shouldn't go outside at all.

22
00:01:33,163 --> 00:01:35,676
Rym: And they were like take public transportation don't walk outside.

23
00:01:35,716 --> 00:01:38,485
Rym: It's dangerous Alright, whatever.

24
00:01:38,506 --> 00:01:39,671
Rym: so I you know I look at the weather.

25
00:01:40,254 --> 00:01:47,956
Rym: There is a air stagnation warning for beacon in addition to an ozone warning and a thunderstorm warning.

26
00:01:47,996 --> 00:01:53,130
Scott: well air stagnation is important for Sailors and ozone is important for old people and thunderstorms.

27
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,273
Scott: That's not a warning.

28
00:01:54,313 --> 00:01:56,660
Scott: That's like a hooray thunderstorm.

29
00:01:58,261 --> 00:02:02,654
Rym: Now I never really lived in a place where ozone was an issue.

30
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:04,720
Rym: I mean in sterling heights, Michigan.

31
00:02:05,382 --> 00:02:06,165
Rym: Everything's flat.

32
00:02:06,305 --> 00:02:08,151
Rym: ozone doesn't accumulate anywhere.

33
00:02:08,252 --> 00:02:10,299
Scott: I've never noticed an ozone issue before ever.

34
00:02:10,961 --> 00:02:13,415
Scott: I mean if you wouldn't have told me I wouldn't have known well.

35
00:02:13,435 --> 00:02:17,386
Rym: You didn't do anything Every day this week.

36
00:02:17,446 --> 00:02:18,611
Rym: I've just been biking outside.

37
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:22,512
Rym: You know when I get home and doing stuff and today bikes broken There's this ozone warning.

38
00:02:22,532 --> 00:02:30,044
Rym: so whatever I've heard about these things in New York City before and we live kind of downstate, so I figured alright Just one of those things.

39
00:02:30,306 --> 00:02:31,451
Rym: It's probably nothing to care about.

40
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:33,360
Rym: I mean I've gone biking in hotter weather than this.

41
00:02:33,762 --> 00:02:43,899
Rym: it was only like 94 or something when I went out and When there's a lot of ozone in the air you can't breathe so well which Really got to me.

42
00:02:44,102 --> 00:02:53,560
Rym: I went out and started rollerblading And I got barely a mile away from the house And I stopped and my body was just trying to die and I couldn't make it and I had to hobble my way back home.

43
00:02:53,942 --> 00:02:58,180
Scott: I would like to know how much of that was psychological like what if you didn't know there was no zone warning?

44
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,651
Scott: What if the same result happened?

45
00:02:59,994 --> 00:03:00,720
Scott: you know what knows?

46
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,526
Rym: I don't think so.

47
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:09,307
Rym: cuz I got kind of Sick, and I really had to get home and cool off and it I I biked in hotter weather And I've run in hotter weather, and I've never.

48
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,817
Rym: I've never had trouble breathing before.

49
00:03:11,837 --> 00:03:17,114
Scott: yeah Anyway, I guess we'll never know unless maybe we tell you it's an ozone warning.

50
00:03:17,134 --> 00:03:18,720
Rym: when it's not go ahead and do that.

51
00:03:19,363 --> 00:03:22,560
Rym: I'm pretty sure I'll be able to tell because I'll be able to breathe or not breathe.

52
00:03:23,148 --> 00:03:26,024
Scott: Yeah, anyway In addition to that.

53
00:03:26,085 --> 00:03:37,811
Scott: I just want to let everyone know that if you have an ionizing air filter Throw it out because basically even though it does kind of filter the air sort of maybe It filters the air really well.

54
00:03:38,374 --> 00:03:39,560
Scott: It fills your house with ozone.

55
00:03:40,142 --> 00:03:45,160
Rym: Yeah, actually this is something I told Scott about back at RIT and now we crusade against it.

56
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:52,540
Rym: Yep, because ionizing air filters You know they use ions and electricity to pull particles out of the air as an air filter.

57
00:03:53,342 --> 00:03:58,660
Rym: But you know that smell after a thunderstorm or that smell after you've had an old NES running for a couple hours.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,025
Rym: That's ozone.

59
00:04:01,085 --> 00:04:03,938
Rym: It is generated by electric electricity.

60
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:09,680
Rym: basically I'm not gonna go over all the details of it, but electrical devices and electrical discharges generate ozone.

61
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,800
Rym: Ozone is somewhat toxic and displaces oxygen in the air among other effects.

62
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,700
Scott: Yeah, it's like you think ozone and you say oh great the ozone layer blah blah blah blah blah.

63
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:21,824
Rym: It doesn't float up there.

64
00:04:22,065 --> 00:04:24,313
Rym: No stays down here and fucks you exactly.

65
00:04:24,393 --> 00:04:27,892
Scott: It's not something you want to breathe It's an ozone just like o3.

66
00:04:27,912 --> 00:04:34,263
Rym: yes It's o3 with uh I forget that I forget the names anymore because it's been Over it.

67
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:36,734
Scott: I used to know in 10th grade chemistry.

68
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:37,336
Scott: now.

69
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:38,300
Scott: I don't know anymore.

70
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,151
Rym: It's been over a decade since I took a chemistry class.

71
00:04:41,352 --> 00:04:43,139
Scott: I took a chemistry class freshman year of r18.

72
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,762
Scott: You know what that that class should have been an a class Like.

73
00:04:47,883 --> 00:04:53,060
Scott: I knew everything because I had just taken chemistry in 10th grade and reviewed all that stuff again.

74
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,260
Scott: Did you just not do the homework?

75
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:56,605
Scott: No one day.

76
00:04:56,645 --> 00:05:03,439
Scott: where I happen to not go to class is the first incredibly easy test And he lets you drop one test.

77
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:10,140
Scott: So I ended up dropping this test that I probably would have gotten a hundred on which is basic.

78
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,294
Scott: What's it called stoichiometry?

79
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:12,576
Scott: Yep?

80
00:05:12,837 --> 00:05:13,039
Scott: Yeah?

81
00:05:14,082 --> 00:05:15,390
Scott: Which I would have gotten a hundred on.

82
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,080
Scott: so that kind of screwed it over.

83
00:05:18,963 --> 00:05:22,440
Scott: And that guy actually was proud that he gave bad grades.

84
00:05:23,301 --> 00:05:25,449
Rym: Yeah, well I can say back in high school.

85
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:30,265
Rym: There were a couple of classes where the average grade was about 35%.

86
00:05:30,265 --> 00:05:33,720
Scott: yeah, this guy was like I give the lowest grades on average and all of our team.

87
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,504
Scott: Whoa ha ha.

88
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:37,059
Scott: and this is my first quarter ever at RIT.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,788
Rym: Wow You know that's one of those situation.

90
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:41,009
Rym: cuz.

91
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,531
Rym: maybe it was cuz.

92
00:05:41,551 --> 00:05:42,194
Rym: I had a hair trigger.

93
00:05:42,214 --> 00:05:46,795
Rym: in basic chemistry I would drop a class at the drop of a hat.

94
00:05:46,855 --> 00:05:49,349
Scott: a lot of people did drop But I mean RIT had.

95
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:51,982
Scott: I went through RIT with no Barely any.

96
00:05:52,023 --> 00:05:54,028
Scott: I don't think I dropped or W to anything.

97
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:58,120
Rym: I dropped like 10 classes, and I double you'd at least four.

98
00:05:58,382 --> 00:05:59,735
Scott: Yeah, I didn't use my W's.

99
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,583
Rym: yeah I didn't.

100
00:06:00,663 --> 00:06:09,873
Rym: well actually I didn't double you so often just because Usually I could tell within a week if I liked a professor or not and if a professor even looked at me the wrong way I was like fuck it and I'd quit.

101
00:06:09,893 --> 00:06:16,059
Scott: yeah the other thing is I Really didn't want a W because that would delay me getting the hell out of there.

102
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,480
Rym: Yeah, I was taking all superfluous classes.

103
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:19,583
Rym: Yeah

104
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:20,421
Scott: See

105
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:25,100
Rym: the trick is I always signed up for one more class than I needed in any given quarter

106
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:26,248
Scott: And then W'd one of them

107
00:06:26,651 --> 00:06:36,050
Rym: or either W'd one of them Or I just drop one like I'd sign up for 16 or 20 credit hours when I only needed 12. that way if one Class sucked, or just the workload wasn't worth it.

108
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:39,139
Rym: I just drop it and not worry about it, and I still learn something.

109
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:40,462
Scott: hopefully Mm-hmm.

110
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:41,225
Scott: all right.

111
00:06:41,326 --> 00:06:44,639
Scott: anyway, let's do the geek back, which you still don't have music for.

112
00:06:45,462 --> 00:06:50,680
Rym: So we got this email from kid with these yes the title of which is quote.

113
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:51,262
Rym: I hope so.

114
00:06:51,282 --> 00:06:53,046
Rym: the dead for is the shit.

115
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:54,430
Rym: exclamation point.

116
00:06:55,072 --> 00:06:56,376
Scott: only one exclamation point.

117
00:06:56,556 --> 00:06:59,945
Scott: Yes a query it is pleased Quite all right, let's.

118
00:07:00,126 --> 00:07:04,979
Scott: I'm probably gonna read the complete first and last paragraphs, but the middle paragraphs are gonna get pair.

119
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:07,239
Rym: of course You're gonna read the complete last paragraph.

120
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:15,797
Scott: Anyway Hey Rym and Scott, I'm an avid listener of your podcast especially your anime and tech shows.

121
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:25,298
Scott: even though I'm a rabid Sony fanboy I tend to agree with most of the shit you give Sony especially about their goddamn Proprietary software and the potential failure the ps3 may be.

122
00:07:26,141 --> 00:07:27,184
Rym: Where's the good news?

123
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:28,568
Rym: where's the good news?

124
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:31,517
Rym: just keep pounding in pounding in pounding you.

125
00:07:31,537 --> 00:07:32,480
Scott: it's bad news.

126
00:07:32,822 --> 00:07:34,914
Scott: Bad news after bad news.

127
00:07:35,297 --> 00:07:42,107
Scott: all right I've got the Sony nwa 20 gigabyte mp3 player.

128
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:43,392
Scott: okay, I don't know.

129
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:44,877
Scott: I have to go look that up to see what it's like.

130
00:07:46,062 --> 00:07:49,620
Scott: Which as a player is great, but the bundled mp3 transfer software?

131
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:50,764
Scott: I've blissfully forgotten.

132
00:07:50,784 --> 00:07:53,194
Scott: the name is mind-boogling Lee crap.

133
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:54,820
Rym: yeah welcome to the club.

134
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,852
Scott: You wanted two G's and not two O's.

135
00:07:57,952 --> 00:07:59,679
Rym: I sympathize with this kid.

136
00:08:00,121 --> 00:08:07,300
Rym: Haha kid bully because my little recording bit we use for conventions is equally terrible that the recording bits great.

137
00:08:07,663 --> 00:08:10,905
Rym: The software is godforsaken Unmitigated crap.

138
00:08:11,287 --> 00:08:19,595
Scott: yeah luckily they re-released their sonic stage software Which does run surprisingly smoother, and I can just about live with Sony's ass.

139
00:08:19,635 --> 00:08:21,520
Scott: poor attempts at making their own software.

140
00:08:22,026 --> 00:08:23,199
Scott: Why God why?

141
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,467
Scott: Exclamation question exclamation question exclamation.

142
00:08:26,728 --> 00:08:29,618
Rym: are you gonna do the AWO thing of read all of the no.

143
00:08:31,163 --> 00:08:33,340
Scott: Is this a test of my faith by the way?

144
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,152
Scott: I love the show about the Mac you got to do your podcasting.

145
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:37,780
Scott: take that you condescending Mac users.

146
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:50,515
Rym: Actually the fun thing is the Mac has found a very useful home in our house considering that now we know about Mac's which we didn't so much before and It's actually a very good living room PC other than a few annoyances.

147
00:08:50,535 --> 00:08:51,319
Rym: We're still working on.

148
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:53,506
Scott: yeah It can't do something.

149
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,790
Scott: well, we'll talk about that another show.

150
00:08:54,871 --> 00:09:02,344
Scott: yeah, but yeah the Mac is not living room PC And overall it's better than our previous living room PC But it still has some minuses.

151
00:09:02,946 --> 00:09:03,648
Scott: all right anyway.

152
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:07,398
Scott: see any of the people in the forum who made a thread about mp3 players.

153
00:09:08,745 --> 00:09:10,075
Scott: Now you know about Sony players.

154
00:09:10,538 --> 00:09:13,917
Rym: Yeah Probably don't buy one unless you're willing to put up with that crap.

155
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:14,320
Rym: yeah.

156
00:09:14,501 --> 00:09:17,919
Scott: And my real question is I guess these Sony players don't work on Linux.

157
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,286
Scott: Maybe do they work on Mac?

158
00:09:20,506 --> 00:09:21,611
Scott: That's a really good question.

159
00:09:22,073 --> 00:09:26,390
Rym: I've run out of actually the recording bit I have does not work at all on the Mac.

160
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,499
Rym: Huh it is Windows only.

161
00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:31,089
Rym: in fact It is Windows 2000 and XP only.

162
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,619
Scott: well and like what about people who?

163
00:09:34,361 --> 00:09:38,762
Scott: I know a lot of people use their iPods and other mp3 players with their Xbox 360.

164
00:09:38,762 --> 00:09:40,635
Scott: Can you use these Sony players with that?

165
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:41,299
Scott: probably not?

166
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:46,418
Rym: Anyway to continue the email because here's the part that's really relevant to tonight's episode mm-hmm.

167
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:52,340
Rym: anyways I wanted to write about my own first-hand experience with the new time crisis for and house of the dead for arcade games.

168
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:59,160
Rym: Both are crazy fun, but I think house of the dead 4 comes out on top as my main coin guzzler and eventually an unhealthy addiction.

169
00:09:59,842 --> 00:10:01,729
Rym: I'm currently doing a summer job at Hong Kong.

170
00:10:01,749 --> 00:10:02,612
Scott: It's a memory chip.

171
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:04,760
Rym: all right all right a Sumerian job.

172
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:12,317
Rym: Ooh, it's a Sumer Sumer All right, I thought I thought we weren't gonna make fun of that.

173
00:10:12,337 --> 00:10:14,058
Scott: start control joke Murn Murn.

174
00:10:15,442 --> 00:10:20,420
Rym: We are the Murn Murn and there are a buttload of arcade centers one of them being just down the road from my office.

175
00:10:21,002 --> 00:10:26,703
Rym: As soon as I listen to your podcast on the new TC 4 and hot D 4 I had to go out and try Them for myself.

176
00:10:26,763 --> 00:10:30,798
Rym: suffice to say I spent a ridiculous amount of money at the arcade that day.

177
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:44,160
Scott: yeah Personally while I like arcade games a lot other than competitive racing games and DDR a gun game I like gun games, but I tend to play them beat them, and then never put any money in them again.

178
00:10:44,502 --> 00:10:45,730
Rym: See well it depends on the game.

179
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,100
Rym: I mean games like time crisis.

180
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:55,354
Rym: I'll play through once with someone like you and then I'm done with it, but a game like I don't know police 911 I'll just play it over and over and over and over and over and over.

181
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,400
Rym: I never get sick of it.

182
00:10:56,541 --> 00:11:01,020
Scott: Yeah, I mean like occasionally I'll play time crisis one or two while I'm standing around.

183
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:03,809
Scott: But you know if I'm not playing the games are.

184
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:07,200
Scott: those are games you play to beat because there's actually some kind of a plot.

185
00:11:07,322 --> 00:11:10,470
Scott: They're kinda And you want to see it.

186
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:13,051
Scott: Yeah, yeah All right.

187
00:11:14,143 --> 00:11:17,438
Rym: Well, then he goes on to review time crisis for and house of the dead for separately.

188
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:21,260
Rym: yes It's got you want to handle the time crisis for since time crisis is your game.

189
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,340
Scott: Yeah, I'm not gonna read the entire time crisis for a review, but he says he's a fan of time crisis.

190
00:11:26,681 --> 00:11:37,077
Scott: He likes the pedal the separate screens and the players taking separate routes adds to the realism The he says the guns are too bulky, but he likes the kickback.

191
00:11:37,158 --> 00:11:39,827
Scott: it's called You know force feedback.

192
00:11:40,288 --> 00:11:42,355
Scott: well force feedback and recoil.

193
00:11:42,615 --> 00:11:47,069
Rym: Yeah, well or kickback I guess a lot of people call it kickback.

194
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:47,952
Scott: Okay, anyway.

195
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:50,400
Rym: I don't know what your problem is against kickback.

196
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,485
Scott: Yeah, personally.

197
00:11:51,605 --> 00:11:54,960
Scott: I think that I want that like a heavy heavy gun to play.

198
00:11:55,764 --> 00:11:57,535
Scott: It's got a feel real freaking sturdy.

199
00:11:57,575 --> 00:11:58,400
Scott: the sturdier the better.

200
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:03,475
Rym: Yeah, the problem is if it if it's as heavy as a real gun you'll get tired right.

201
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,820
Rym: quick playing a game like that.

202
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:13,200
Scott: Yeah, but if it's you know as light as say the games for area 51 back in the day It's like it's too light.

203
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,554
Scott: So it's really hard to aim because any small movement of your arms.

204
00:12:16,594 --> 00:12:17,919
Scott: Just you know the gun moves a lot.

205
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:21,197
Scott: It's too easy to move the gun around anyway.

206
00:12:22,057 --> 00:12:26,251
Scott: Uh His main gripe with the game is that it's a little too hard.

207
00:12:26,532 --> 00:12:31,679
Scott: the switching view mode is overwhelming at times Especially when you're completely surrounded, and he forgets to switch views.

208
00:12:31,739 --> 00:12:38,400
Scott: well I didn't have the problem of not knowing to switch views because it puts these giant left and right arrows on the screen.

209
00:12:38,662 --> 00:12:42,059
Rym: Yeah, though you didn't get so far in the game yet I have a feeling it gets kind of nuts.

210
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:45,151
Scott: I do have a feeling it gets a bit nuts and also this they can.

211
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:57,920
Scott: you know you have to keep switching weapons because in certain Parts you need the right gun, but at the same time If the game is too hard that all depends on how the arcade operators set the difficulty if people don't realize this.

212
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:20,920
Scott: but pretty much every arcade game even things like pac-man and Galaga have Internal difficulty settings where if you open up the back panel you can set it to like easy normal hard stupid hard and Generally what they do is on our very very popular arcade games They set them to stupid hard so that that way people will play lose real quick, and then play again.

213
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,848
Rym: Yeah, like stupid hard sinistar exactly.

214
00:13:23,908 --> 00:13:39,005
Scott: and when games get you know you know older and older and are played less Arcade people put them on easy like you'll know an easy Galaga machine Because you can just hold the button down and the ship keeps shooting, but on a hard Galaga machine It's it's the real Galaga.

215
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:42,377
Scott: He shoots one two one two you know.

216
00:13:42,938 --> 00:13:51,880
Scott: so yeah anyway He keeps getting shot, maybe his reflexes are crap, and he hasn't perfected dodging bullets.

217
00:13:52,021 --> 00:13:52,924
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty much.

218
00:13:52,964 --> 00:13:56,577
Scott: time crisis is all about is when you see the thing you let go of the pedal.

219
00:13:56,979 --> 00:14:13,351
Scott: however I have noticed that in time crisis You know one two three when you're about to be shot this like a red ring Appears around a bad guy whose bullet is going to hit you and when you see the red ring you pretty much have to let Go of your pedal immediately or else you're gonna get hit in time crisis.

220
00:14:13,431 --> 00:14:18,068
Scott: for at least the ones that I played on the shore I had no chance personally.

221
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:18,591
Rym: yeah the

222
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:33,698
Scott: time that you have Reflex wise to escape getting shot is almost nil like you'd pretty much have to let go of the pedal Like a millisecond after the red ring appears And I don't know if that's because of the difficulty setting on the machine or if they just made time crisis for harder.

223
00:14:33,738 --> 00:14:40,240
Scott: in general The great choice of weaponry is a superb addition that you will generally stick to the pistol.

224
00:14:41,521 --> 00:14:46,735
Scott: The weaponry actually of you know the pistol the machine gun the shotgun and the grenade launcher.

225
00:14:46,775 --> 00:14:49,725
Scott: those were added in time crisis 3 Not time crisis 4.

226
00:14:49,725 --> 00:14:53,380
Scott: I don't know if there's any more weapons because they didn't get very far in the game.

227
00:14:53,621 --> 00:14:57,341
Rym: I think maybe his point might be that the weapons seem like in time crisis 3.

228
00:14:57,341 --> 00:14:59,797
Rym: I almost never changed weapons like I never even thought.

229
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:01,569
Scott: he says here You'll mostly stick to the pistol.

230
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:05,892
Scott: however in time crisis 4 They do give you a lot more ammo for all the guns.

231
00:15:05,933 --> 00:15:16,117
Scott: like in time crisis 3 you start out Only with pistol ammo and time crisis 4 you have ammo for everything and you're actually Required to use the other weapons to get through certain parts of the game.

232
00:15:16,137 --> 00:15:24,087
Scott: in 3 the weapons are just kind of there to use whenever you're having a hard time or you know just have fun with a machine Gun in time crisis.

233
00:15:24,127 --> 00:15:32,711
Rym: for their actual gameplay elements I seem to get a lot of ammo for those things which was Surprising and I ended up using them a lot more than I would have expected.

234
00:15:32,751 --> 00:15:34,739
Rym: cuz I'm a hoarder in games like that.

235
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,766
Scott: in any Game the shotgun especially.

236
00:15:36,806 --> 00:15:41,180
Rym: that gives you choice of weapons, and they're all limited ammo like eternal darkness.

237
00:15:41,663 --> 00:15:52,500
Rym: I would use that axe or the knife or whatever Non-ammo weapon I had on Every freaking enemy and then I get to the end of a stage and have a million bullets for whatever guns I had because I never used them.

238
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:57,236
Scott: That was always my problem and especially FPS is I would just save up every.

239
00:15:57,277 --> 00:16:02,709
Scott: well except for doom and doom I just waste my rockets like really doom I would count like individual shotgun.

240
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:05,580
Scott: it's weird in doom the game where you need to save stuff the most.

241
00:16:05,941 --> 00:16:06,764
Scott: I don't hoard at all.

242
00:16:06,784 --> 00:16:17,940
Scott: I just spend it because I love shooting that plasma and everywhere, but in half-life 2 I'm just like saving every goddamn ammo and using the weakest weapon possible to kill the enemies nearby.

243
00:16:18,806 --> 00:16:20,840
Scott: I'm like Ooh, let me move this way.

244
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:30,000
Scott: I can kill those guys with a barrel and you know the fire barrel and a pistol Instead or I'll throw a blade at them with a gravity gun instead of wasting a bullet.

245
00:16:31,082 --> 00:16:31,945
Scott: All right, all right.

246
00:16:32,346 --> 00:16:33,470
Rym: now then House of the Dead.

247
00:16:33,551 --> 00:16:35,678
Scott: Oh he gave time crisis for eight out of ten.

248
00:16:35,698 --> 00:16:38,430
Rym: true true Well, no he gave it star star star star star.

249
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,454
Rym: eight over ten.

250
00:16:39,514 --> 00:16:40,820
Rym: star star star star star star star star star.

251
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,535
Scott: It's like eight forward slash ten.

252
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:47,779
Rym: nah Alright, I'm going to try to actually read the second paragraph here in the review section.

253
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,290
Scott: Whoa.

254
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,080
Rym: House of the Dead 4.

255
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,400
Rym: I've never really liked playing the House of the Dead games, but this version is ridiculously addictive.

256
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:59,720
Rym: The new Uzi-style guns are fairly easy to handle, but unfortunately with the addition of the shake mechanism, they didn't include a kickback mechanism.

257
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:07,220
Rym: The new shake mechanism adds another fun interactive feature to the game, but the situations where you use it are easy to complete, like a zombie or a boss grabs you.

258
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:18,760
Rym: I believe they've also integrated the shake mechanism into reload, so you don't need to aim off-screen to reload, you just need to give the gun a shake to reload, which is very useful when dealing with a horde of zombies.

259
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:26,619
Rym: My friend and I attempted to complete the game, but we gave up when the final boss respawned after an extremely drawn-out final battle.

260
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,260
Rym: Yeah, Crystal Chronicles, ahem, ahem.

261
00:17:29,601 --> 00:17:31,419
Scott: Every game made by Square ever, ahem.

262
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:41,758
Rym: No, I don't think we can ever express to anyone who hasn't played Crystal Chronicles how long the final boss fight is.

263
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:45,480
Scott: Well, when we were the minimum level necessary to do it, basically.

264
00:17:46,021 --> 00:17:46,819
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

265
00:17:47,121 --> 00:17:50,060
Scott: If we had leveled up for like two more days, we would have been much shorter.

266
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:50,876
Rym: Hours!

267
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,180
Rym: Hours on one boss, and every time we killed it, a new boss came.

268
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,053
Rym: Anyway, anyway.

269
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,360
Rym: This game was crazy fun to play and extremely addictive.

270
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,480
Rym: You put a great emphasis on crazy fun.

271
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:11,020
Rym: There is a decent variety of zombies and monsters to annihilate, and although there are no weapon upgrades, you do have grenades, which can be useful in a sticky situation.

272
00:18:11,121 --> 00:18:13,360
Rym: You gave the game 9 out of 10.

273
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,720
Scott: Yeah, personally, you know, I didn't really, I mean, House of the Dead was always cool.

274
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:29,520
Scott: It was the gun game to play when Time Crisis wasn't there, but I personally, the thing I don't like about House of the Dead in general is that you're shooting so much, 'cause you take, you can't just shoot the zombies dead, or shoot twice the zombies dead.

275
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,580
Scott: Like in Time Crisis, shoot a guy in the head, he falls over, unless he's wearing armor.

276
00:18:33,441 --> 00:18:48,140
Scott: It was just, aim at a guy, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, aim at a guy, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, so many times to get these zombies to fall down, and it was just kind of hurting your hand, and there was a lot more just pulling the trigger a whole lot, and a lot less aiming and doing cool things.

277
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:56,217
Scott: Yep, the ooziness really seems to mitigate that, 'cause now it's just, brr, brr, brr, Exactly, you just aim at the zombies, you hold it down, you sweep across the zombie heads.

278
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,839
Rym: And it just, it has the whole survival instinct of only shoot the zombies that are a threat, ignore the ones in the back.

279
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,188
Rym: Yep.

280
00:19:02,923 --> 00:19:03,900
Scott: Alright, and okay.

281
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:10,140
Scott: By the way, on a completely unrelated note, I'm starting my third year project sometime in the coming university semester.

282
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,954
Scott: He studies aerospace engineering at the University of Manchester.

283
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:15,593
Scott: Good game.

284
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,313
Scott: In the UK.

285
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:22,058
Scott: And his project title is "Bluetooth as a Communication Device for Wireless Sensors".

286
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:30,540
Scott: My knowledge of Bluetooth is pretty basic, so if you guys read my email on your Geek Bag segment, yep, here you go, then some info on the Bluetooth system would be much appreciated.

287
00:19:30,701 --> 00:19:34,580
Rym: We got some people we could probably get on the show to do one hell of an episode about that sort of thing.

288
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:34,910
Rym: Yeah.

289
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,860
Scott: Hope you guys have a chance to check out these kickass games, we already did, and thank you to the great podcast.

290
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,314
Scott: Cheers.

291
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:39,789
Scott: Kid.

292
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:52,638
Scott: Um, yeah, Bluetooth, I actually had a job that I did, making, well not making the wireless sensors, but writing code for a wireless sensor concentrator device thingy.

293
00:19:53,680 --> 00:20:05,238
Scott: And from what I know about Bluetooth, which isn't a whole lot, I've never actually used a Bluetooth device, but from what I understand, it's rather slow, and its range is fairly limited.

294
00:20:06,621 --> 00:20:11,020
Scott: And for a wireless sensor, I'm not sure it would really be the best choice.

295
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:12,860
Rym: But it depends on the application.

296
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:13,599
Scott: It really does.

297
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:25,100
Scott: And also, you know, he's coming at it from the standpoint of aerospace engineering, whereas I'm computer science, so I really, it's a lot more difficult for me to talk from his angle.

298
00:20:25,421 --> 00:20:30,520
Rym: Though, we could definitely do a Monday show sometime probably after Otakon.

299
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:35,458
Scott: Yeah, I think before we did that, we would need to get some Bluetooth devices and try to work with them.

300
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,819
Rym: Yeah, we could also get like, we could get James on the show.

301
00:20:38,183 --> 00:20:38,517
Scott: Or Steve.

302
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,059
Scott: Steve Pomeroy.

303
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,359
Scott: Steve knows a lot about Bluetooth.

304
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,193
Rym: Yeah.

305
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,820
Rym: So we've got some guests we could do for that.

306
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,300
Scott: So that's the end of the Geekbag segment.

307
00:20:44,722 --> 00:20:44,810
Rym: Yeah.

308
00:20:45,441 --> 00:20:49,060
Rym: We'll probably cover these two games one final third time.

309
00:20:49,322 --> 00:20:49,999
Scott: After we beat them.

310
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,900
Rym: Yeah, after we go to the shore and pump quarters in until all the zombies are dead.

311
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,679
Scott: God, it's gonna be like 30 bucks a game.

312
00:20:56,701 --> 00:20:57,220
Rym: That's fine.

313
00:20:57,703 --> 00:20:59,320
Scott: We could buy a DS game instead.

314
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,860
Rym: There's no new DS games I want.

315
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,159
Scott: There are gonna be real soon.

316
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:02,979
Rym: Yeah, quiet you.

317
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:03,537
Scott: Okay.

318
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,194
Scott: Alright.

319
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,259
Scott: We've been talking about board games as our main bits on gaming day for a while now.

320
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,433
Scott: And so we're gonna do a news today.

321
00:21:12,474 --> 00:21:13,359
Scott: that's about video games.

322
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,380
Rym: So see, today we covered arcade games, video games, and soon to do, board games.

323
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:18,016
Rym: All in one go.

324
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:18,676
Scott: There you go.

325
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:28,400
Scott: So if anyone hasn't been paying attention, there is a game called Team Fortress 2 that has been promised by Valve for many, many years.

326
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,579
Rym: God, I was in high school and I remember people telling me TF2 was coming out.

327
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,720
Rym: Oh my god.

328
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:40,999
Scott: Like, up until a few years ago, you could go to Valve's website and the same message about Team Fortress 2 was still there.

329
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,680
Scott: Until, I think until Steam came out, the same message was there.

330
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:51,159
Rym: Yeah, because basically, real briefly, there was some of the original mods for Quake 1 back in the day.

331
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,360
Scott: There was one called Team Fortress.

332
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,980
Rym: They were all, they were very similar.

333
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:59,320
Rym: They were all Team Fortress or Team Fortress style where it's like capture the flag but with classes.

334
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,399
Scott: Mega Team Fortress.

335
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,920
Rym: Yeah, Weapons Factory.

336
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,819
Scott: Yeah, they were all Team Fortress-ish.

337
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,020
Scott: And when Half-Life came out, there was a mod called Team Fortress Classic.

338
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,700
Rym: That was very, very popular among people who played Half-Life.

339
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:17,840
Scott: It was like Team Fortress but slower but also more polished.

340
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,300
Rym: I didn't like it at all, personally.

341
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,952
Scott: I didn't like it, however, there was, most of it.

342
00:22:22,992 --> 00:22:29,800
Scott: I didn't like, however, the Hunted game mode was good because that was essentially CS Assault before CS Assault existed.

343
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:42,399
Rym: See, I'll sound like an old man with my brittle old man hit, but honestly, of all the Team Fortress style capture the flag games, Weapons Factory and Mega TF just to me are hands down the best ever made.

344
00:22:43,082 --> 00:22:50,120
Rym: And I'll try this Team Fortress 2 but it's been so long and that genre of gaming has really kind of died away.

345
00:22:50,884 --> 00:22:52,420
Rym: I wonder how much of an impact it'll have.

346
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,739
Rym: Maybe it'll revive the genre.

347
00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:05,779
Scott: Yeah, that's what I'm hoping, you know, especially with Valve's new engine, they could do some really interesting stuff because one of the big things about a Team Fortress games are all the different interesting classes and weapons.

348
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,300
Rym: Yep, and just the fact that games like this tend to really lend themselves to a pickup game.

349
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:32,120
Rym: I mean, Tribes 2, as great as it was, once a game, like if a game started, if you just joined a game, you couldn't really get into it, it was too late, you had to be there from the beginning and you could only get the full experience if you played with a bunch of people you know and a clan, but these Team Fortress style games really seemed to allow for the lone wolf and really allowed pickup games to work really well.

350
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,820
Scott: Yeah, even better than Counter-Strike.

351
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,060
Rym: Yeah, in a lot of ways.

352
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:35,516
Scott: Which is, yeah.

353
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:42,220
Scott: Anyway, the point is that Team Fortress 2, which has been promised for years and years is finally really promised.

354
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,739
Scott: They might beat Duke Nukem forever to the punch.

355
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:57,276
Scott: And what's gonna happen is when Half-Life 2 Episode 2 comes out, which is going to come out, I don't know, possibly next year, I'm not quite sure, Team Fortress 2 will also come out.

356
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,198
Scott: Supposedly.

357
00:23:58,723 --> 00:23:59,339
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

358
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,979
Rym: Yeah, Duke Nukem's gonna come out too.

359
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:02,319
Scott: Yeah, we'll see which one.

360
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,556
Scott: But anyway, yeah.

361
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:12,740
Scott: And also, supposedly, when Half-Life 2 Episode 2 comes out, another game from Valve is going to be released called Portal.

362
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,760
Rym: Now, we just watched, well I just watched, Scott had watched it before I think.

363
00:24:16,861 --> 00:24:18,460
Scott: I didn't, I watched it for the first time just now.

364
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:18,859
Scott: Oh, great.

365
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:29,338
Rym: The video kind of demo of what this game is about, and I went from completely uninterested to quite interested in about 15 seconds.

366
00:24:29,921 --> 00:24:34,840
Scott: If I could describe this, I mean, Half-Life 2 is a first-person shooter adventure.

367
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,020
Scott: You know, it has puzzles, but it also has shooting.

368
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,460
Scott: Portal is a first-person puzzler.

369
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,578
Rym: It's just an FPP.

370
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,700
Rym: There's no shooting, as far as we can tell.

371
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,320
Scott: I think there was a bit of shooting, but I don't think it was the shooting skill.

372
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,780
Scott: It was more like Chip's Challenge, avoid the laser.

373
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,800
Rym: I think there's less shooting in this game than there isn't.

374
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,699
Scott: I wonder if anyone listening knows what Chip's Challenge is.

375
00:24:55,841 --> 00:24:57,040
Rym: Can I remember Chip's Challenge?

376
00:24:57,244 --> 00:24:57,392
Scott: Okay.

377
00:24:58,223 --> 00:25:01,560
Rym: I wonder, no, it might be on that hard drive.

378
00:25:01,681 --> 00:25:02,156
Scott: It might be.

379
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:02,960
Rym: That dead one.

380
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,820
Scott: I think I might be able to get a copy of it anyway.

381
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:15,560
Scott: The point is, is that Portal, you know in Half-Life 2 there's a gravity gun, which allows all sorts of new, interesting gameplay in a first-person shooter?

382
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,739
Rym: Well this game has the portal gun.

383
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:25,100
Scott: Yes, what it seems like is you shoot the portal gun, and whatever solid surface or wall that you hit, it makes a portal.

384
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,940
Scott: And you can shoot somewhere else to make the other end of the portal.

385
00:25:29,222 --> 00:25:30,219
Scott: And then you walk through.

386
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,600
Rym: Now the engine handles this in an incredibly awesome, pretty way.

387
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:34,986
Rym: Yeah.

388
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,460
Rym: You just walk right through.

389
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,740
Rym: You can just see into the portal.

390
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,500
Rym: If you can set up situations where you can see yourself in the portal.

391
00:25:43,563 --> 00:25:45,360
Scott: This guy was going through loops and stuff.

392
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:50,700
Scott: It's cool because for puzzles, there'll be a puzzle like, get this block into that hole.

393
00:25:50,820 --> 00:26:08,120
Scott: So you'll have to make a portal, throw the block, the block goes through the portal, lands near you, then you, you know, crazy 3D interactive environment puzzles involving you creating portals, moving blocks, dodging things, jumping over things, going indoors.

394
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:19,760
Rym: It seems like a game like this could be really, really intellectually stimulating because it's, I mean, there's the old 2D puzzle games, you know, push the blocks around, avoid the doohickeys, you know, collect the jemmies and put them in the holes.

395
00:26:19,948 --> 00:26:20,157
Scott: Lolo.

396
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:26,770
Rym: This is a three dimensional version of that that seems to be implemented in a way that no one has ever done before, i.e.

397
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,415
Rym: well.

398
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,972
Scott: I'm really thinking because, you know, we were talking- Notice how I used i.e.

399
00:26:32,094 --> 00:26:32,479
Rym: correctly.

400
00:26:32,846 --> 00:26:32,974
Scott: Yep.

401
00:26:33,462 --> 00:26:33,818
Rym: Pig fuckers.

402
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,240
Rym: Yeah.

403
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:53,259
Scott: So, um, you know, early on in this podcast, in our early episodes, we talked a lot of how PC gaming was dying and it still is as far as I'm concerned, but it really seems like Steam, the one PC gaming platform that, you know, I still had hope for, is really starting to pick up, well, Steam.

404
00:26:54,962 --> 00:26:58,859
Scott: You know, and I mean, the ship came out, which I'll talk about later because I bought that.

405
00:26:59,400 --> 00:26:59,469
Scott: Yep.

406
00:26:59,923 --> 00:27:03,520
Scott: And, uh- I mean, really- Half Life 2 Episode 1 was really good, if short.

407
00:27:04,561 --> 00:27:13,280
Rym: The only thing that's lacking on Steam right now is a new multiplayer crazy hit game because nothing's really supplanted Counter-Strike, even to this day.

408
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:13,799
Rym: Yep.

409
00:27:14,281 --> 00:27:14,388
Scott: Yep.

410
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:15,479
Scott: But, yeah.

411
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,579
Scott: Hopefully NS will, NS Source will come out.

412
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,017
Scott: Yep.

413
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:29,760
Rym: Honestly, Natural Selection Source is one of the few reasons in the world that I want to build a fast enough PC to play Half Life 2.

414
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:37,820
Scott: Yeah, see, my- I'm really considering, uh, you know, possibly next year buying a computer that does one thing and one thing only.

415
00:27:38,181 --> 00:27:38,960
Scott: Run Steam.

416
00:27:39,521 --> 00:27:43,620
Scott: And if I was Valve, you know, Valve the company, 'cause- SteamOS?

417
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,720
Scott: Well, 'cause what they've done is they've basically supplanted, uh, the game store.

418
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:54,836
Scott: You don't need to go- you know, Game Stops and EB's have less and less space for PC games now.

419
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:12,480
Scott: And Steam is allowing games that would otherwise get nothing, games like The Ship and, uh, Darwinia and such, and they're giving them, you know, a huge store to be sold in at reasonable prices that can be downloaded and- I mean, there's now effectively no barrier to entry.

420
00:28:12,741 --> 00:28:18,060
Rym: You can just write a pro- a game, or a mod, and you can sell it to Steam.

421
00:28:18,181 --> 00:28:19,720
Scott: If it's good enough, Valve will sell it.

422
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,340
Rym: And if it's not good enough, the barrier to entry is your own stupidity.

423
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,360
Scott: Yeah, the barrier to entry is Valve approves of your game and thinks it's cool.

424
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:32,540
Scott: Yeah, so there's- no one has the excuse of- Or Vivendi or whoever the- you know, I don't know how- I don't know the actual how it works out.

425
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:37,390
Rym: No one now has the excuse of, "Oh, the industry is blocking me out and won't let me in and blah blah blah blah

426
00:28:37,411 --> 00:28:37,655
Rym: blah.".

427
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:38,200
Scott: Yeah.

428
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:43,340
Scott: So, you know, Steam really, I think, is the hope for the future of PC gaming.

429
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:43,938
Rym: The great white hope.

430
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:45,120
Scott: Exactly.

431
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:52,860
Scott: And, uh, if there was some Steam OS, or perhaps even a device, like, "Here, buy this box.

432
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,740
Scott: This box does nothing other than run Steam flawlessly.

433
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:57,451
Scott: It's a thousand

434
00:28:57,492 --> 00:28:57,900
Scott: dollars.".

435
00:28:58,001 --> 00:29:00,619
Scott: You know, something like that, I would totally go for it.

436
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,439
Scott: Yeah, that- we probably- Or, you know, Steam for Linux, hello?

437
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:05,040
Rym: Hello?

438
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,780
Rym: I really don't know why they haven't.

439
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,800
Rym: I mean, it wouldn't take that many resources- Steam for Mac OS, hello?

440
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:13,460
Scott: What's up?

441
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,980
Rym: Actually, yeah, it's Intel Mac now.

442
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:15,759
Rym: It'd be even easier.

443
00:29:16,145 --> 00:29:16,399
Scott: I know.

444
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,700
Scott: I don't know what the problem is.

445
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,700
Rym: In fact, because OS X is BSD-like, it'd be- if you ported it to either one, it'd be trivial to port it to both.

446
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,440
Scott: It's pretty much- they only need to do one port, 'cause they won't- just forget the PPC Mac.

447
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,478
Rym: You know what the problem is?

448
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:30,576
Rym: DirectX.

449
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,939
Scott: Yep, I mean, Half-Life 2, you know, they pretty much gave up on the OpenGL.

450
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,937
Scott: It's all the DirectX.

451
00:29:36,362 --> 00:29:49,100
Scott: Yeah, that's the one thing that really bothers me, is that- I'm beginning to think that's why Half-Life 1 Steam and Wine runs well, because it's OpenGL, yet the Half-Life 2 Steam and Wine doesn't- it works.

452
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:54,120
Scott: It is working perfectly, except for the performance is less than a frame a second.

453
00:29:54,380 --> 00:30:06,040
Rym: It just seems that Microsoft is leveraging DirectX with ATI in order to make it so that no platform can run games other than Windows, thus ensuring that gamers will all buy it.

454
00:30:06,141 --> 00:30:08,580
Scott: Which is also DirectX, and Windows.

455
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,340
Rym: Yeah, well that's just a PC, running effectively Windows.

456
00:30:11,981 --> 00:30:13,600
Scott: Sort of, but yeah, you get the idea.

457
00:30:13,761 --> 00:30:15,620
Rym: It's running all the parts of Windows that matter.

458
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:16,698
Rym: For gaming.

459
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,540
Rym: When you think about it.

460
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,080
Rym: For everything we would use Windows for.

461
00:30:19,321 --> 00:30:19,839
Scott: Yeah, I know.

462
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:27,779
Scott: If only- I think they are gonna release a lot of these games to the 360, but I really need the whole Steam experience of modding things and all that.

463
00:30:28,505 --> 00:30:28,760
Scott: Yeah.

464
00:30:28,921 --> 00:30:29,819
Scott: And the keyboard and the mouse.

465
00:30:30,444 --> 00:30:30,759
Scott: We'll see.

466
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,257
Scott: And the monitor.

467
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:47,698
Rym: Because honestly, the golden age of PC gaming is long past us, and despite your opinions on whether or not gaming is actually dying or not, no one could argue with me successfully that PC gaming is anywhere near the heights it achieved in the mid to late 90s.

468
00:30:48,624 --> 00:30:49,040
Scott: Exactly.

469
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:53,960
Rym: I'd like those days to come back, and I hope they will, I'm just not terribly optimistic.

470
00:30:54,100 --> 00:31:00,158
Rym: Though I think these two games and all of the assorted bits around them are the best hope we have right now.

471
00:31:00,571 --> 00:31:00,654
Rym: Yep.

472
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:09,850
Rym: Things of the Day!

473
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,029
Rym: Now I can't hold back on this one.

474
00:31:12,951 --> 00:31:20,210
Rym: I was looking for a thing of the day, as we usually do before the show, we poke around, we show each other some things of the day, try to figure out, alright, does that pass muster?

475
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:22,909
Rym: Is it good enough to be a GeekNights thing of the day?

476
00:31:23,655 --> 00:31:24,270
Rym: Is it topical?

477
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:24,870
Rym: You know, whatever.

478
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:25,850
Rym: Is it old news?

479
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,790
Rym: Maybe I'll call it retro and then it's not really old news.

480
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:29,409
Rym: That sort of stuff.

481
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:38,810
Rym: Now, I kind of randomly stumbled upon this, and I had no idea what it was other than that it had the words "skeleton" and "prank" in the title.

482
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,409
Scott: Ooh, those are good words.

483
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:55,489
Rym: So I started, and it's this Spanish dude, or Mexican dude, in a, he's wearing like a black cape and a black top hat, and he's got a microphone and a mustache, and he looks like a really, not evil, but evil in an awesome way dude.

484
00:31:55,892 --> 00:31:58,390
Rym: And he's speaking very rapidly in Spanish.

485
00:31:59,094 --> 00:31:59,729
Scott: I think it's Spanish.

486
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:03,430
Rym: He's explaining some sort of prank or something that is about to go down.

487
00:32:03,772 --> 00:32:05,770
Rym: And I'm wondering, alright, what's going on?

488
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:06,750
Rym: Are they going to show me where the prank is?

489
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:10,870
Rym: Then he shows you this skeleton sitting on a motorbike.

490
00:32:11,332 --> 00:32:12,669
Scott: Or a bicycle, we can't really tell.

491
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,890
Rym: Yeah, it looks like a motorbike, because it makes motorbike noises.

492
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:15,369
Scott: It does.

493
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:20,809
Scott: And the skeleton is rigged up, so when he talks into the microphone, the skeleton's mouth moves.

494
00:32:21,391 --> 00:32:22,069
Rym: Alright, so.

495
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,130
Scott: And the sound comes out of the skeleton with a speaker.

496
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,170
Rym: So I'm wondering, what's this all about?

497
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:36,889
Rym: Then it immediately cuts to a dude walking down the street, and this skeleton on a motorbike rides by and yells something at the guy, and the guy just loses it.

498
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:42,490
Scott: You have to watch this, it is fan-fucking-tastic.

499
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,650
Rym: I mean, I've seen a lot of funny things of the day.

500
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:49,730
Rym: There's a monkey thing of the day we haven't used yet, that is just of the highest caliber.

501
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,950
Rym: But this is the first time- It is Tuesday.

502
00:32:55,052 --> 00:33:01,090
Rym: This is the first time in a long time that I not only lolled, but I roffled.

503
00:33:01,571 --> 00:33:09,029
Rym: I was laughing uncontrollably when that skeleton rode by the dude, and the dude just freaks out and runs away and trips over himself.

504
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:19,750
Scott: So the lesson for today is that skeletons, fake skeletons talking and scaring people while riding motorcycles equals a rofelcopter crashing into a loller coaster.

505
00:33:21,172 --> 00:33:39,308
Rym: The best one is there's this homeless guy, like the last one they get, he's sleeping under a rag or a blanket or something, and the thing rides up, and the homeless guy, he drops his rag as he's running away, and you see him, he turns around to try to grab it, but then he sees a skeleton, and he's scared shitless, but then he really needs that thing, and he doesn't know what to do.

506
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:45,430
Scott: Okay, my thing of the day is from some guy on LiveJournal.

507
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:48,789
Scott: But don't let that get you down.

508
00:33:49,890 --> 00:34:00,990
Scott: This guy was in Japan, and as you may or may not know, or you should know being a geek, Akihabara, or aka Electric Town, is the geek mecha of the entire universe.

509
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:16,728
Scott: And if you go there, there are many many stores which sell things like electronic doodads, retro video games, incredible amounts of video games, manga, toys, old, old, incredibly old school video games.

510
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:20,350
Scott: Anything awesome that a geek could want can be found in Akihabara.

511
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:31,629
Scott: However, little do many geeks know that the true mecha of video gaming shopping is not in Akihabara.

512
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:33,068
Scott: No it is not.

513
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:41,949
Scott: It is in three stops away, it is on the train, three stops away from me on the Togani line to Gumyo.

514
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:49,368
Scott: If you go there, and then you walk for 30 minutes in sweltering humidity, a skeleton will ride by and yell at you.

515
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:52,810
Scott: Exactly, you can tell that I'm paraphrasing this guy's blog.

516
00:34:53,530 --> 00:35:01,549
Scott: You'll find this store that has more video games in one place than I've ever seen in my entire life.

517
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:08,410
Scott: You could take this store, fly it over to the U.S Do you remember the thing of the day of the guy who had an incredible video game collection in his basement?

518
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:09,570
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

519
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:14,270
Scott: One shelf of this store puts that guy's entire collection to shame.

520
00:35:15,315 --> 00:35:17,143
Rym: They could lift this up, bring it over to the

521
00:35:17,243 --> 00:35:17,505
Rym: U.S.,

522
00:35:17,565 --> 00:35:19,310
Rym: stick it in Manhattan and make it a museum.

523
00:35:20,032 --> 00:35:20,250
Scott: Exactly.

524
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:27,423
Scott: I mean, not only do they have pretty much every Playstation game, every NES game, every SNES game, blah blah blah, etc.

525
00:35:27,483 --> 00:35:27,665
Scott: etc.

526
00:35:27,705 --> 00:35:27,806
Scott: etc.

527
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:33,330
Scott: They've got every obscure thing you could possibly imagine.

528
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:36,170
Scott: Now of course the prices are high for things at this store.

529
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:40,210
Scott: If you want to buy a DS, I wouldn't recommend buying a DS there, or an Xbox there.

530
00:35:40,552 --> 00:35:43,429
Rym: But if you need some sort of old NES game...

531
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:51,647
Scott: If you need an ultra rare Sega Saturn game, if you need a Neo Geo, if you need a Neo Geo PC LT, or...

532
00:35:52,071 --> 00:35:54,530
Rym: If you need a Sega CD so you can play Sewer Sharks.

533
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:55,323
Scott: Yeah.

534
00:35:55,850 --> 00:36:02,409
Scott: If you need games for, you know, hard... If you need a Sega Master System, they've got a mess of them.

535
00:36:03,634 --> 00:36:04,708
Scott: This is the place to go.

536
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:08,790
Scott: And there's really not much more I can describe to you with words.

537
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,530
Scott: You just have to see the pictures.

538
00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:13,430
Scott: You just have to see the pictures of this place.

539
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:16,030
Scott: They even have stacks and stacks and stacks of manga.

540
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:24,439
Scott: As well as on one wall, they have the Playstation 100, which are the 100 most popular used Playstation 1 games.

541
00:36:25,971 --> 00:36:27,790
Scott: So yeah, this store is the amazing.

542
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:30,730
Scott: Now there's one more thing you have to know about this store.

543
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:41,249
Scott: Next door, there is a store that is "full of one coin figures, models, toys, and more Gundam goods than you could point a stick at.

544
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:42,703
Scott: This is for another

545
00:36:42,743 --> 00:36:42,966
Scott: day.".

546
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:44,889
Scott: The guy didn't go to that store.

547
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:47,709
Rym: That says a lot.

548
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:53,490
Scott: So there is an amazing store that is basically the king of video games, as far as I'm concerned.

549
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:58,190
Scott: I've yet to see any other store beat this store as being the ultimate video game store.

550
00:36:58,911 --> 00:37:02,869
Scott: And next to it is what is supposedly the ultimate toy store.

551
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:04,890
Scott: I mean, a little figurine store.

552
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:06,787
Scott: So there you have it.

553
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:07,430
Rym: Yeah.

554
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:11,830
Scott: Akihabara is bait to lure the geeks away from the true mecha.

555
00:37:12,091 --> 00:37:13,470
Rym: I really just have to go to Japan.

556
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:15,329
Scott: I think so too.

557
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:18,170
Rym: I could spend months there just seeing all of this.

558
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:25,470
Rym: Seeing like the... It's weird how much of the media and geekery I consume comes from Japan and Japan alone.

559
00:37:25,831 --> 00:37:36,228
Scott: I really have to go there and then go to this store, buy stuff, ship it home on UPS, go to this store, buy stuff, ship it home, over and over again until I've gotten everything I needed.

560
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,788
Rym: I think I'd be content just looking at it.

561
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:41,170
Rym: I'd buy like one thing and keep it in my house as a relic.

562
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:43,610
Rym: Like when you go to a sacred shrine and you take the rock home.

563
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:49,550
Scott: See, here's the thing, is that I would be content just looking at it, but I also want to play a lot of it.

564
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:55,210
Scott: Now, if there was some way I could go to the store... ♫ Emulation is your friend.

565
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:55,230
Scott: ♫.

566
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,470
Scott: Some of these things can't be emulated, that's the point.

567
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,830
Scott: I don't want to play like SNES games, whatever.

568
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:07,028
Scott: I want to play like the ultra rare Sega Saturn games or, you know, these ultra rare Neo Geo games.

569
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,410
Scott: Things that no one else can play.

570
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,009
Scott: Things that aren't emulated.

571
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,929
Scott: Things where there are no emulators for them.

572
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,943
Scott: Those are the things I want to play.

573
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:16,530
Scott: real bad.

574
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:22,850
Rym: Yep, but anyway, we should probably move on to the main bit since we are trying to cut the show back down to a reasonable length.

575
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,190
Rym: And we've already gone on far longer than we expected.

576
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:30,829
Scott: Okay, so today we are talking about the classic board game that everyone in the whole world should play.

577
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:33,429
Rym: It's the marijuana of board games.

578
00:38:33,852 --> 00:38:35,029
Rym: It is the gateway game.

579
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:36,130
Scott: Exactly.

580
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:46,570
Scott: I mean, pretty much anyone I know who's into German games who wasn't so cool to be into it before German games were cool, got into German games via playing Settlers of Catan.

581
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:54,945
Rym: In fact, I remember very specifically when I went to RWAG, which was the giant, giant gaming club at RIT, where, you know, I went there before.

582
00:38:54,985 --> 00:38:58,610
Rym: I went to the anime club, even though the anime club was far more influential in my life.

583
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:05,690
Rym: But I went and I saw people playing this game called Settlers, and everyone was saying like, "Oh, Settlers is the best game.

584
00:39:05,771 --> 00:39:06,301
Rym: Oh, you have to play

585
00:39:06,342 --> 00:39:06,668
Rym: Settlers.".

586
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:07,307
Rym: Everyone talked about it.

587
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:11,230
Scott: I heard a lot of people talking about it, but I didn't play it until many, many moons later.

588
00:39:11,551 --> 00:39:14,230
Rym: I played it quite a bit sooner than Scott, and you know what?

589
00:39:14,592 --> 00:39:15,766
Rym: I got my ass handed to me.

590
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:18,929
Scott: There were guys there who were real good at it.

591
00:39:19,271 --> 00:39:25,750
Rym: Yeah, the thing is, now we are both completely equal to them, and in fact everyone who is good at Settlers is all equal, but we'll get to that later.

592
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:45,508
Rym: Now the game, the reason we're going to talk about this is it's an old game, and we know that all of you German game fans know about this game, but a lot of people have been asking us or talking about how to get into gaming, how to get into German games, and this is really, other than possibly Carcassonne, one of the best games ever to start your German habit with.

593
00:39:46,032 --> 00:39:50,984
Scott: Yes, the thing is, as we'll explain later, it is not a good game to continue your habit with.

594
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:55,310
Rym: Yep, now the game is very simple in how it's constructed.

595
00:39:55,390 --> 00:40:01,750
Rym: You have a board, and the board consists of hexes, and every hex is a different type of resource.

596
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,830
Scott: Yeah, there's what, the grain?

597
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,190
Rym: Grain, wood, brick, stone, and sheep.

598
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,330
Scott: There is also one desert tile.

599
00:40:08,591 --> 00:40:09,490
Rym: Which is nothing.

600
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:13,750
Scott: And is surrounded by water, and some of the water has ports on it.

601
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:15,409
Scott: Pretty much every other water has a port.

602
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:20,370
Rym: Now everyone goes around, and you start with two villages on the board, and a village will - Settlements.

603
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:21,550
Rym: Well yeah, but it doesn't matter.

604
00:40:21,671 --> 00:40:22,026
Scott: It doesn't matter.

605
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:22,587
Scott: Little houses.

606
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:27,190
Rym: Little houses that you put at the intersection of three hexes.

607
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:34,022
Rym: Now every hex will also have a tile with a number on it, and the number corresponds to a possible roll on 2D6.

608
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,129
Rym: Two six-sided dice.

609
00:40:37,011 --> 00:40:38,210
Scott: Which means two through twelve.

610
00:40:38,931 --> 00:40:44,070
Rym: Now say you have a little house next to - One of the hexes touching your house is a forest.

611
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:46,868
Rym: It's a green tile, and there's a four on it.

612
00:40:47,631 --> 00:40:49,349
Rym: And whoever rolls the dice rolls a four.

613
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:51,010
Scott: You get a tree card.

614
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:52,250
Rym: You get a green resource.

615
00:40:52,471 --> 00:40:53,729
Rym: One wood into your hand.

616
00:40:54,591 --> 00:40:59,270
Rym: And the whole game is you go around, and every turn, whoever's turn it is, rolls the dice.

617
00:40:59,711 --> 00:41:00,910
Rym: Everyone collects their resources.

618
00:41:01,391 --> 00:41:04,170
Rym: Then you're allowed to trade freely with whoever's turn it is.

619
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,490
Rym: So you can be like, "Anyone got any brick?

620
00:41:06,611 --> 00:41:07,762
Rym: I got plenty of sheep, but I need a

621
00:41:07,802 --> 00:41:08,004
Rym: brick.".

622
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:08,803
Scott: Mm-hmm.

623
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:14,589
Scott: Because what'll happen is, number one, the game is a fight to try to get more resources than everyone else.

624
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:20,210
Scott: Because you can always trade in four resources of any one kind for any other resource.

625
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:25,529
Scott: So if you can get enough of one thing, that's the same as having a whole bunch of different stuff.

626
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,990
Rym: Yeah, the game is basically you'll get these resources.

627
00:41:28,051 --> 00:41:28,829
Rym: You want to trade them.

628
00:41:29,171 --> 00:41:35,250
Rym: And the reason you're doing this is that you have a little card that shows you what all the things you can build cost in resources.

629
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:43,066
Scott: Yeah, so you can build roads, you can build settlements, you can build cities, which are upgraded settlements, and you can buy Stiffy cards.

630
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:46,370
Rym: Which are just like special hidden cards that have powers.

631
00:41:46,811 --> 00:41:56,050
Scott: Most of them are soldiers, but the point of the game is that pretty much anything you buy will directly get you a point, or possibly slightly less than a point.

632
00:41:56,790 --> 00:42:01,070
Scott: And if you can get ten points, you win, and everyone starts the game with two points already.

633
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,530
Rym: Yeah, and first one to ten wins.

634
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,589
Rym: It's a straight-up race.

635
00:42:03,951 --> 00:42:18,450
Scott: Yeah, so the race is get the most resources, get the right kinds of resources, spend them to build things and expand your total settlement, and in the end, get to ten points before anyone else gets to ten points.

636
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:28,707
Rym: It's primarily a strategic game in that you pick, I mean, the way it works is actually, it's a cool mechanic, especially people who have never played German-style games before and never run into anything like this.

637
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:35,049
Rym: Whoever starts first puts a settlement down, and then you go around clockwise and everyone puts a settlement down on the board.

638
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:41,968
Rym: Then whoever placed last starts again going counterclockwise and puts their second settlement down.

639
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:45,326
Rym: So basically, whoever went first also goes last.

640
00:42:46,870 --> 00:43:05,010
Scott: Yep, so it's a really fair way to place your settlements, because assuming that everyone puts their settlement in the best, their starting settlement, in the best possible position, the guy who goes first gets one settlement in the best position on the board and another settlement in the second best position on the board.

641
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:14,490
Scott: Now my favorite thing to do is, if the other players are inexperienced, I like to go fourth because they all put their things in stupid places, and then I take the two best places.

642
00:43:16,192 --> 00:43:19,910
Scott: If everyone is really experienced, I like to go second or third.

643
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,409
Scott: It really doesn't matter either way.

644
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:33,530
Rym: Now the thing is, you're probably not going to have settlements on all the hexes that you need to generate all the resources to build different things, and furthermore, different types of things require different types of resources.

645
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:35,750
Scott: Yeah, if you want to build roads, you need bricks and woods.

646
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:39,170
Rym: And if you want to build cities and stiffy cards, you need a lot of rock and sheep.

647
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:41,170
Scott: Yeah, rock and grain also.

648
00:43:42,135 --> 00:43:43,010
Rym: But you need sheep for everything.

649
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:55,830
Scott: Yeah, so some people start off the game getting lots of brick and wood, which is great because they can build lots of roads, which you need to connect your settlements, and maybe they'll get the odd sheep and grain to build some more settlements.

650
00:43:55,930 --> 00:44:03,110
Scott: But they don't get any rock, which means they're going to have a hard time making stiffy cards, and they're going to have an even harder time building cities.

651
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:06,990
Rym: Now, you get a point for everything you've got on the board, well, every main thing.

652
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:09,670
Rym: A settlement is worth one point, and a city is worth two points.

653
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:15,549
Rym: And the other ways to get points are that there are two tiles, longest road and largest army.

654
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:22,709
Scott: Yes, whoever has the longest road in the game that is at least five roads long, I think, gets three points.

655
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:22,957
Scott: Two.

656
00:44:23,457 --> 00:44:23,564
Scott: Two?

657
00:44:23,835 --> 00:44:24,308
Rym: I think it's two.

658
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:25,249
Scott: It doesn't matter.

659
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:29,590
Scott: And whoever has the most soldiers, at least three soldiers, right?

660
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:30,768
Rym: Yes, at least three.

661
00:44:31,371 --> 00:44:34,009
Scott: Gets two points, three points, whatever it is.

662
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:34,909
Rym: It doesn't matter.

663
00:44:35,191 --> 00:44:36,390
Rym: And that's really the whole game.

664
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:40,670
Rym: The only other mechanic is that, as it goes around, you know, you're drawing resources.

665
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:44,450
Rym: Any time a seven is rolled, the robber comes out.

666
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:45,008
Rym: The robber!

667
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:53,109
Rym: Now, first off, anyone who has more than seven cards in their hand, more than seven resources, has to discard half of them rounding up.

668
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:59,829
Scott: Yep, now, obviously, if everyone is rolling 2d6 on their turn, seven is the most common result.

669
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:04,570
Scott: However, you know, seven compared to all the other results combined is not the most common.

670
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:14,230
Rym: Then you take the robber, because you rolled a seven, and you put it on a tile, and whatever tile he's on, even if that tile's number is rolled, nothing comes out.

671
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:23,050
Scott: So if I put it on the four that is next to Rym, you know, let's say Rym's settlement or city is next to a grain that has the number four on it.

672
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:24,349
Scott: I put the robber on top of that.

673
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:29,649
Scott: Now Rym rolls the number four, he doesn't get any grain where he normally would have gotten two grains.

674
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:31,690
Rym: Yeah, and then I punch Scott in the face.

675
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:32,386
Scott: Exactly.

676
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:33,870
Scott: That's what the robber is all about.

677
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:44,168
Rym: Now the game is mostly just having the strategy of, I plan to start here and here, I want to build roads this way, I want to build settlements this way, this is how I'm going to get the victory points to win.

678
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:48,345
Rym: It's slightly tactical in, alright, that guy is going for the same place.

679
00:45:48,426 --> 00:45:51,480
Rym: I'm going, I got to trade for the wood and bricks.

680
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,949
Rym: I need to build the road to block him off so I can build my thing.

681
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:54,489
Scott: Exactly.

682
00:45:55,131 --> 00:46:09,830
Scott: The only randomness in the game is the dice, which is actually kind of annoying, you know, because the dice can often decide the game, you know, just randomly, hey, they kept rolling four, I don't get anything on four, Rym gets three resources whenever a four is rolled.

683
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:10,807
Rym: I'd rather have three Reese's.

684
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:13,549
Scott: Yeah, but Rym is probably going to win if that keeps happening.

685
00:46:13,931 --> 00:46:15,090
Scott: I mean, monkeys are, oh, okay.

686
00:46:15,411 --> 00:46:34,690
Scott: Yeah, but, you know, assuming an even distribution of dice rolling, you know, a bell curve of dice rolling, you know, you can say at the beginning of the game, alright, well I'm going to spend my resources in this fashion, I'm going to build that, then that, then that, then that, then that, and that's the fastest way that I can get ten points based on this starting position and the resources that are available.

687
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:37,710
Rym: Now, all of that is very, very quick.

688
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:44,850
Rym: The only part of the game that takes a lot of time, and it's the most important part, it's also the most fun, especially for people who have never played a game like this before, is the trading.

689
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:45,541
Scott: Mm-hmm.

690
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:58,770
Rym: Because you want to trade with other people, but you've got to be careful, because any time you trade, you're obviously helping the other person almost as much as you're helping yourself, unless they're an idiot and they're allowing you to get away with a steal.

691
00:46:59,133 --> 00:46:59,470
Scott: Exactly.

692
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:03,210
Scott: The problem in Settlers is that the highlight of the game is trading.

693
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:07,670
Scott: Anyone whose turn it is can freely trade resources with anyone else.

694
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:12,510
Scott: You can't trade, like, if it's Rym's turn, anyone can trade with him and he can trade with anyone.

695
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:17,550
Scott: But if it was my turn, then Rym couldn't trade with Joe, because it's my turn.

696
00:47:17,971 --> 00:47:20,470
Rym: Even though a lot of people will ignore that rule.

697
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:23,270
Scott: Yeah, and they'll just wait until someone's turn and then make the trade.

698
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:26,610
Scott: But the point is, is that the trading is a lot of fun.

699
00:47:27,252 --> 00:47:34,830
Scott: You have certain resources, you need other resources, someone else has them, and you trade them resources they need for resources you need.

700
00:47:35,231 --> 00:47:38,737
Rym: And of course, you make a lot of jokes the other way, you know, "I got a lot of sheep, I need some

701
00:47:38,819 --> 00:47:39,144
Rym: wood.".

702
00:47:39,597 --> 00:47:39,808
Scott: Yes.

703
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:45,408
Scott: You know, "Uh, uh, you know, my sheep, they need grain to eat, cause they're full of

704
00:47:45,448 --> 00:47:45,769
Scott: bricks.".

705
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:49,810
Rym: There's also implements like there are ports around the edges and they let you trade in resources.

706
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,050
Rym: Like a sheep port makes sheep more valuable for you.

707
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:55,229
Rym: We don't need to get into all that, because if you're gonna play the game, you'll read the rules.

708
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:55,550
Scott: Yes.

709
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:57,827
Scott: The point of the trading, though, is this.

710
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:01,190
Scott: It's a lot of fun, and it's the highlight of the game.

711
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:03,410
Scott: It's what makes this game exciting for new players.

712
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:07,750
Scott: The problem with it is that there are really only three ways a trade can turn up.

713
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:11,090
Scott: Number one, you trade with someone and they rip you off.

714
00:48:11,432 --> 00:48:13,130
Scott: It's a not fair trade in their advantage.

715
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:14,229
Scott: You basically just screwed yourself.

716
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:16,769
Scott: Number two, you rip someone off.

717
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:19,150
Scott: Well, good for you, now you're probably gonna win.

718
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:23,990
Scott: Number three, you didn't even trade with someone else.

719
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:30,389
Scott: Basically all that does is speed up the game, because it boosts both of you equally in front of the other players.

720
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:36,650
Rym: However, the reason you do that is if you're gonna trade, you try to trade equally, especially the players who are losing.

721
00:48:36,731 --> 00:48:40,288
Rym: If someone's losing, you want to trade with them all the time, because you don't care if you help them out.

722
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:40,930
Scott: Exactly.

723
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:44,130
Rym: You might even let them rip you off if you really need a resource.

724
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:44,730
Rym: Mm-hmm.

725
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:46,209
Scott: Now, here's the thing, though.

726
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:47,829
Scott: Imagine a four-player game, right?

727
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:54,149
Scott: Let's say I make an even trade with Rym, then I make an even trade with Joe, and then I make an even trade with Jill.

728
00:48:55,151 --> 00:49:00,350
Scott: Now, I've made each of them, it's an even trade, and it boosts both of us equally.

729
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:04,650
Scott: But I've been boosted three times, and each of them has been boosted once.

730
00:49:04,931 --> 00:49:05,789
Scott: Do you see how that works?

731
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:07,030
Scott: Do you see how that works?

732
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,490
Rym: There is also a big element of the Stiffy cards we mentioned.

733
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:16,189
Rym: They're like hidden cards that you buy, and most of them are soldiers, which allow you to move the robber around, and you can get Largest Army with them.

734
00:49:17,091 --> 00:49:22,286
Rym: Some of them are also special cards, like build a bunch of roads, or Monopoly is the best.

735
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:29,010
Rym: Monopoly is, you name a resource, and everyone gives you all of that resource that they have in their hand.

736
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:32,090
Scott: So let's say you don't have a lot of rock, and everyone else has a lot of rock.

737
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:35,070
Scott: You say, "Monopoly rock," and everyone has to give you all their rocks.

738
00:49:35,291 --> 00:49:38,510
Rym: Or one of the first devious strategies someone will come up with when they play this game.

739
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:44,198
Scott: It's the basic strategy that noobs only fall for once, and experienced people never fall for.

740
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:47,928
Rym: Say I've got a lot of grain, and I have a Monopoly, because keep in mind, these cards are secret.

741
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:53,530
Rym: Like, a lot of times, someone will have a Stiffy card, and it might be a victory point.

742
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:55,810
Rym: Some of the cards are just straight up one victory point.

743
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:58,210
Rym: Some of the cards, you know, they have the power, some of the soldiers.

744
00:49:58,791 --> 00:50:01,450
Rym: And someone rolls a seven, and they're out to place the robber on your space.

745
00:50:01,933 --> 00:50:08,967
Rym: You hold your Stiffy card up, you're not allowed to show it to them, but you can say, "This is a soldier, and I will fuck you if you put that thing on my

746
00:50:09,248 --> 00:50:09,549
Rym: text.".

747
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,890
Rym: I suggest you put it on someone else's text.

748
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:12,947
Rym: Preferably Scott's.

749
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:13,482
Scott: Mm-hmm.

750
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:14,450
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

751
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:18,250
Scott: There's also the element of giving people resources to say, "Please don't rob me.

752
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:18,718
Scott: Take this

753
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,190
Scott: resource.".

754
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:21,945
Scott: But I've always had the policy of, "Don't give anyone

755
00:50:22,147 --> 00:50:22,509
Scott: anything.".

756
00:50:22,771 --> 00:50:23,370
Rym: Yeah, well that's all.

757
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:30,390
Rym: I mean, people who... Generally, people who are less experienced with German games, and less experienced with Settlers, enjoy the game a lot more.

758
00:50:30,531 --> 00:50:35,547
Rym: Like, someone will roll a seven, and people are bribing them like, "I'll give you two rock if you dump this on

759
00:50:35,649 --> 00:50:35,750
Rym: Luke.".

760
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:37,438
Scott: Yeah, see, that's a lot, a lot of fun.

761
00:50:37,478 --> 00:50:43,350
Scott: when you're bribing people to not rob you, you're bribing people to rob someone else, you're trading resources with people.

762
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:46,610
Scott: There's a lot of stuff going on, and it's a lot of fun mechanics.

763
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:57,750
Rym: Yep, but before we go on with this, I just want to say, if you're new to German board gaming, or German-style gaming, or real board gaming in any way, I highly, highly, highly recommend Settlers of Catan.

764
00:50:58,292 --> 00:51:03,049
Rym: Also, if you are into German gaming, but you've just never played Settlers, I highly, highly, highly recommend it.

765
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:05,809
Scott: You have to play it at least once or twice, until you figure it out.

766
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:32,390
Rym: But, now the disclaimer's gone, once you get into German gaming, and you've learned a lot about it, and you start learning game theory, maybe not the math behind it, or the theory behind it, but a practical application of it, meaning you can apply game theory in a is a 100% random game among experienced players.

767
00:51:33,411 --> 00:51:41,530
Scott: Yeah, I mean, really, if everyone playing the game is very, very, you know, experienced at the game, they are all going to play perfectly.

768
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:43,510
Scott: There is going to be barely any trading.

769
00:51:43,891 --> 00:51:46,327
Scott: No one will ever bribe anyone who has Robber.

770
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:47,609
Scott: They'll just say, "Rob me!

771
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,389
Scott: You'll get one resource if you rob me.

772
00:51:49,651 --> 00:51:52,290
Scott: If we all bribe you, you're gonna get one resource from each of us.

773
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:52,734
Scott: Screw

774
00:51:52,775 --> 00:51:52,978
Scott: that!"

775
00:51:53,776 --> 00:51:54,088
Scott: You know?

776
00:51:54,770 --> 00:52:06,730
Scott: And the game pretty much comes down to who went first, because everyone will put their settlements in the optimum position, so whoever just happened to be in the, you know, the way the board is laid out, and also the dice rolls.

777
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:15,450
Rym: Now this was evidenced most powerfully for me, because I hadn't played the game in a long time, and I went to a sanctioned Settlers of Catan tournament.

778
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:16,133
Scott: Whoa!

779
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:24,909
Rym: This was at UberCon two years ago, and they had the qualifiers, and everyone was talking about qualifying rounds.

780
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:28,910
Rym: I beat everyone into the ground, and I won, like, out of hand.

781
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:31,630
Rym: In one of the games, someone else almost beat me.

782
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:34,690
Rym: It was like ten, nine, and they would have won on their turn.

783
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:35,509
Rym: I just got a little lucky.

784
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:39,630
Rym: And then we finally, you know, that narrowed everyone out, you know, elimination.

785
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:45,070
Rym: Then we got to the semi-finals, where now it's all people who are good at the game.

786
00:52:45,471 --> 00:52:50,729
Rym: It is all people who understand the game, are good at German gaming, have a very good grasp of how the game works.

787
00:52:51,573 --> 00:52:53,750
Rym: At that point, the game was done.

788
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:55,370
Rym: It was completely random.

789
00:52:56,130 --> 00:53:02,350
Rym: Because after that point, like, when I played with the qualifying, everyone was yelling and screaming and yelling and having fun and playing with each other.

790
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:11,449
Scott: There are a bunch of noobs that you can trade with, you know, if there's a bunch of noobs playing the game, you trade with all of them equally, and that way, you know, you get boosted times three and you win.

791
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:15,678
Rym: Or you pick one of them who you know is just really dumb, and you trade with him the whole game.

792
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:18,250
Scott: And you just keep ripping him off and siphoning his resources.

793
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:18,639
Scott: Yeah.

794
00:53:18,991 --> 00:53:23,824
Rym: Or you king make, where, say you have a situation where you can help yourself and help someone else.

795
00:53:24,271 --> 00:53:26,470
Rym: Even if you'll help the other person more than you'll help yourself.

796
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:40,530
Rym: If you know the other person is not smart enough or not in a position to win, despite being helped like this, you help them as much as you can to elevate both of you so far ahead that no one else has a chance to play.

797
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:41,449
Rym: They can't win.

798
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:43,750
Rym: And now the game is only between you and this idiot.

799
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:46,330
Rym: It's kind of how a lot of Roman emperors got put into power.

800
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:49,450
Scott: So there's a game of, Settlers is mostly played with four people.

801
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:50,348
Scott: You can play with three.

802
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:51,028
Scott: It sucks.

803
00:53:51,652 --> 00:53:53,030
Rym: Five and six is really fun.

804
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:56,370
Scott: There's an expansion pack that allows you to play with five and six players.

805
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:59,250
Scott: It's fun, but it ruins the game even more, I say.

806
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:00,250
Rym: Yeah, to a point.

807
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:07,270
Rym: I mean, in some ways, it makes the game a little more skill-based, but at the same time, it also makes the game a lot more random.

808
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:09,169
Rym: It's hard to explain unless you play it.

809
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:22,390
Scott: Yeah, we're talking about the basic four-player Settlers with no, there are a lot of expansions for Settlers, and a lot of alternates to Settlers, like Starfares, Seafarers, Cities and Knights, Settlers of Canaan instead of Catan, yeah.

810
00:54:23,631 --> 00:54:28,350
Rym: But I mean, we got to the semi-finals, and everyone played perfectly optimally.

811
00:54:28,772 --> 00:54:29,809
Rym: No one said a word.

812
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:39,090
Rym: I think there was one trade in the whole game, and literally, the victory points was like, everyone has two, then one guy has three, then everyone has three, then someone has four, then everyone has five.

813
00:54:39,531 --> 00:54:49,690
Rym: And in the final round, I kid you not, it was the guy who won had ten, the rest of us all had nine, and all of us would have won on our turn.

814
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:53,410
Rym: Like, I'm not exaggerating at all, this is exactly how it ended.

815
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:59,810
Rym: We all looked at each other, and the one girl who was sitting to the right of me said, "Yeah, I don't know why they had a Settlers tournament.

816
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:00,479
Rym: This is kind of

817
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:00,805
Rym: silly.".

818
00:55:02,338 --> 00:55:03,169
Rym: And that was the end of that.

819
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:07,870
Scott: Yep, it really, if people are skilled at Settlers, it comes down to randomness.

820
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:24,329
Scott: It really isn't a game of skill, it is the purpose of Settlers of Catan, it is probably the best game in the world for introducing people to German-style gameplay, and having a lot of fun trading things if you haven't figured out the game yet.

821
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:30,205
Rym: Alright, and on that note, I believe we are out of here, and actually on time and schedule for once.

822
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:31,230
Scott: Holy crap.

823
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:32,265
Rym: I don't know what I'll do.

824
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:34,749
Scott: Free up a lot of space on Libsyn.

825
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:37,470
Rym: Yeah, actually the Libsyn problem was resolved.

826
00:55:37,811 --> 00:55:44,608
Rym: I gotta say, as a quite quick meta bit before I leave, that Libsyn, I mean we complained about them a lot early on.

827
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:46,650
Scott: We did, rightfully so I believe.

828
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:47,850
Rym: Yeah, definitely.

829
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:50,870
Rym: But they've been getting steadily and steadily better.

830
00:55:51,531 --> 00:55:58,568
Rym: So I'm not gonna endorse Libsyn 100% yet, but they're doing adequately and it's worth the money.

831
00:55:59,350 --> 00:55:59,475
Scott: Hooray.

832
00:56:00,114 --> 00:56:01,008
Rym: That's what I'll say for now.

833
00:56:08,641 --> 00:56:10,760
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

834
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:13,399
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

841
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:40,240
Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

842
00:56:40,944 --> 00:56:44,120
Scott: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
