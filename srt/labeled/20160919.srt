1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,856
Rym: It's Monday September 19th 2016.

2
00:00:10,856 --> 00:00:16,030
Rym: I'm Rym, I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:25,085
Rym: technology books Like the ones with animals on them and the ones without animals on them, but mostly the animal ones I think Was the best one?

4
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,987
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:36,626
Scott: so some guy a bad guy In New York yep of New Jersey, New Jersey.

6
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:41,350
Scott: well from New Jersey from New Jersey cuz he you know That's how people do in New Jersey.

7
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:44,175
Rym: Well, I mean Philly fans.

8
00:00:44,316 --> 00:00:49,034
Scott: he came over and he tried to bomb us shitty like yeah I'll do a very good job.

9
00:00:49,234 --> 00:00:53,448
Rym: like thieves stole two of his bags, and then we're like oh shit.

10
00:00:53,468 --> 00:00:53,930
Rym: There's a ball.

11
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:54,696
Scott: Okay, we don't know.

12
00:00:54,716 --> 00:00:56,931
Scott: is this dude right, but you know well It's.

13
00:00:56,951 --> 00:01:00,445
Scott: so why did he have a gunfight with the cops when they when they chase after?

14
00:01:00,465 --> 00:01:05,530
Scott: well not to get into the details of It but from what I get I mean if he doesn't if he wasn't guilty of bombing he's guilty of gunfights.

15
00:01:06,253 --> 00:01:07,770
Rym: This shit these aren't Hollywood bombs.

16
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:11,930
Rym: So it was like a pressure cooker with a flip phone taped to the outside with wires coming out of it.

17
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:14,723
Rym: So the thieves like accidentally knocked.

18
00:01:14,763 --> 00:01:16,310
Scott: don't you still plug it in somewhere?

19
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:18,174
Rym: So what do you mean?

20
00:01:18,214 --> 00:01:18,595
Rym: plug it in.

21
00:01:19,017 --> 00:01:19,841
Scott: you got a pressure cooker.

22
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:20,684
Scott: right it needs to be like.

23
00:01:20,925 --> 00:01:24,370
Rym: no the pressure cook is just A vessel it's just a nice like form container.

24
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:27,022
Scott: Oh, I thought you were using the pressure aspect of it.

25
00:01:27,183 --> 00:01:28,750
Rym: Do we need to do a money show on bombs?

26
00:01:29,518 --> 00:01:30,610
Rym: I know a lot of our bombs.

27
00:01:30,771 --> 00:01:33,645
Scott: I always thought when you made you want to make a pressure your bomb you need to plug it in.

28
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:34,670
Scott: so no it works.

29
00:01:35,177 --> 00:01:35,950
Rym: This is why you would be.

30
00:01:37,176 --> 00:01:38,590
Scott: You could just put the bomb in a pot.

31
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,956
Scott: Why do you need to put it in a pressure?

32
00:01:39,996 --> 00:01:42,950
Rym: pressure cookers have much thicker walls and?

33
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,835
Rym: Nicely sealed to compress the blood.

34
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:45,417
Rym: a lot of reasons.

35
00:01:45,457 --> 00:01:46,220
Rym: use a pressure cooker.

36
00:01:46,461 --> 00:01:46,822
Scott: okay.

37
00:01:47,243 --> 00:01:49,912
Rym: anyway the moral is Real-life.

38
00:01:49,972 --> 00:01:53,143
Rym: bombs by non-professionals are not Hollywood bombs.

39
00:01:53,204 --> 00:01:57,441
Rym: apparently the way to disable these bombs It's just to pull the cell phone off, and then they won't go off

40
00:01:57,722 --> 00:01:58,827
Scott: pretty much, so

41
00:01:58,847 --> 00:02:01,387
Rym: yeah I had this guy you know bombed us and

42
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:05,049
Scott: meanwhile But when the cops tried to use their robot they fucked up and it blew up.

43
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:07,722
Rym: Yeah, that one might have been a pipe bomb like.

44
00:02:07,742 --> 00:02:10,637
Scott: it might be different, but some thieves Accidentally designed.

45
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:14,918
Rym: yeah thieves stole two of the bombs Which says a lot about New York.

46
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:15,360
Scott: right?

47
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:22,488
Scott: the point is we're still lucky that no terrorist ever at least very few have actually been smart people who could do a lot of damage.

48
00:02:22,628 --> 00:02:28,855
Scott: yep and So because of that We're not really afraid of them They're not a concern.

49
00:02:28,876 --> 00:02:31,850
Rym: and I finally lived in New York long enough to where I can be that New Yorker.

50
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,338
Rym: He says shut the fuck up and leave us alone.

51
00:02:33,378 --> 00:02:33,820
Rym: We're fine.

52
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:34,303
Scott: That's right.

53
00:02:34,343 --> 00:02:37,458
Scott: people messaging us and well I am I am like.

54
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,709
Scott: it's nice to know that somebody cares about me.

55
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:40,532
Rym: Yeah, like.

56
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:42,861
Rym: I do appreciate when someone's like okay.

57
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:43,604
Rym: Oh look.

58
00:02:43,905 --> 00:02:45,210
Scott: I'm not a person that is hated.

59
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,460
Scott: No one said oh, I hope Scott died in that bombing.

60
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:48,605
Scott: Yeah, you didn't get it.

61
00:02:48,786 --> 00:02:49,750
Rym: I am that's like you dead.

62
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:52,599
Scott: That's nice because I'm not the most likable person.

63
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:58,439
Rym: so that's good, but you say that but on the grand scale of actual humans You're still way above even like the median.

64
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,002
Scott: I guess I'm not.

65
00:02:59,464 --> 00:03:05,399
Scott: I try hard not to be that guy But yeah only what?

66
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,749
Scott: like how many people do even one person dying?

67
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,918
Scott: I think about like 21 people got hurt.

68
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:10,761
Rym: so what I gather?

69
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:14,938
Rym: one person was injured enough to go to the hospital and apparently they Were released mm-hmm.

70
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,150
Rym: the other 28 people didn't even go to the doctor.

71
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,846
Rym: They had cut scrapes abrasions or they put a band-aid on it.

72
00:03:20,926 --> 00:03:21,770
Scott: Yeah, right.

73
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:24,060
Rym: So maybe some ear damage, but that's fine.

74
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,345
Scott: people messaging us.

75
00:03:25,365 --> 00:03:27,474
Scott: a you do not understand How big New York is.

76
00:03:28,057 --> 00:03:29,905
Scott: B now where it was the bombing?

77
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:30,950
Scott: like in Chelsea or something?

78
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:39,737
Scott: So if you knew my apartment was in Chelsea and you knew the radius of like a pipe bomb is like less than a block and you knew that I lived on that Block maybe you should message.

79
00:03:39,777 --> 00:03:42,405
Rym: Yeah, like Nate Silver lives apparently right there, right?

80
00:03:42,445 --> 00:03:43,368
Rym: He tweeted right away.

81
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:44,956
Rym: He was like guys I'm fine right.

82
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:50,265
Scott: also like the restaurants are all still open right like if you know That like I live right there.

83
00:03:50,286 --> 00:03:54,602
Scott: like if you heard Bombing in Astoria on the corner Scott lives on.

84
00:03:54,622 --> 00:03:58,726
Scott: then if you message me that would make sense But I would probably message you first.

85
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:04,970
Scott: Well, if you hear even bombing in like LIC by rims apartment, you don't need to message me.

86
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,626
Scott: You know how far away that is, you know big LIC is.

87
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,170
Scott: Yeah, and do you know how many people are in New York?

88
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:15,970
Scott: If a hundred people get killed by a bomb the odds of it being me are so small.

89
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:21,529
Scott: I mean if this one car accident in the town Bumblefuck town you live in that kills like point one.

90
00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:23,729
Rym: There's no population kills one person.

91
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:31,652
Scott: There's a greater odds of that being you then a hundred people dying in New York City the odds of that being me Math.

92
00:04:32,073 --> 00:04:37,010
Scott: so if shit goes down in New York do not message us also the harm caused by that bomb.

93
00:04:37,674 --> 00:04:46,290
Scott: You know itself and this crazy guy is bad But it's so small compared to the harm caused by the fear that suburban people have.

94
00:04:46,672 --> 00:04:49,610
Rym: Well because it's telling no one in New York was tweeting like oh my god.

95
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:59,830
Scott: The harm caused by the existence of the TSA alone is like that guy times 100,000. and the reason the TSA exists is because you suburban people are cowards unlike us New Yorkers.

96
00:05:00,252 --> 00:05:01,699
Scott: So stop being fucking afraid.

97
00:05:02,061 --> 00:05:04,452
Scott: stop watching the goddamn news Right.

98
00:05:04,693 --> 00:05:06,358
Scott: learn something about to New York.

99
00:05:06,498 --> 00:05:09,728
Scott: or if you want us to respect you as a human being move to New York.

100
00:05:09,808 --> 00:05:12,136
Rym: not to say Don't consume news.

101
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:13,682
Rym: Don't watch news.

102
00:05:13,722 --> 00:05:15,067
Rym: Don't watch watching news.

103
00:05:15,087 --> 00:05:15,830
Rym: You're watching CNN.

104
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:21,276
Scott: Don't consume the typical fear-mongering nonsense news That's making you think that way.

105
00:05:21,457 --> 00:05:21,638
Scott: now.

106
00:05:21,678 --> 00:05:26,850
Rym: now to get back to your actual point because you know There's a story because you know the anniversary of 9/11 was recently.

107
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:30,166
Scott: Oh, thank you New Yorkers for all the funny tweets about how we don't give a fuck.

108
00:05:30,387 --> 00:05:33,690
Rym: Oh my god I saw FARC was pretty great about that.

109
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,164
Scott: I mean, that's one good thing about the suburban people being so afraid.

110
00:05:37,224 --> 00:05:39,765
Scott: is that us New Yorkers get to be like Well, look how brave we are.

111
00:05:40,892 --> 00:05:41,073
Scott: Why?

112
00:05:41,113 --> 00:05:44,130
Scott: yes, we aren't as cowardly as you suburban folk.

113
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:50,730
Rym: Thanks for reminding us on September 11th when the attacks happen the real attacks Scott and I were in Rochester at RIT, right?

114
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:51,792
Rym: Mm-hmm.

115
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:52,796
Rym: and they happened.

116
00:05:53,257 --> 00:06:00,750
Rym: and then every relative I had tried to call me on the phone That day and in the days to come to find out if I was okay.

117
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,098
Rym: And if I was there.

118
00:06:02,178 --> 00:06:10,370
Rym: and I want to point out that home was Detroit Going to school in Rochester and the 9/11 attacks happened in New York City a six mile drive.

119
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:17,430
Rym: New York City is further away from where I was in college than where I was in college was from Detroit.

120
00:06:18,093 --> 00:06:21,368
Scott: Yeah, New York City is a six mile drive from Rochester.

121
00:06:21,388 --> 00:06:24,479
Scott: six Seven maybe mile.

122
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:29,194
Scott: No sick hour hour drive You know what.

123
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:33,670
Scott: even six miles away from the World Trade Center you would have been just fine.

124
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:36,505
Rym: It is a five and a half hour drive if you are insane.

125
00:06:37,028 --> 00:06:45,750
Rym: Yeah but and even now the other thing is I guess it's more people just like the common thing you're expected to say is like hey, are you okay?

126
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:51,331
Rym: But everyone who said that to me knew I was okay because one I don't stop tweeting Like.

127
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:57,657
Rym: you'll know something's wrong if you hear about a bombing and then rims not tweeting because I'm tweeting all the time And I'm just doing shit on the internet all the time.

128
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:00,530
Rym: So I think it's more that people say hey, are you okay?

129
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,727
Rym: But really they mean hey, sorry that happened near you, but that sounds kind of weird.

130
00:07:04,747 --> 00:07:08,553
Scott: to say to someone what you should say is Nothing.

131
00:07:08,573 --> 00:07:15,981
Scott: and also well, I'll make it much more in If say also suburban people, are you okay?

132
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:19,130
Scott: I mean you're driving that really dangerous car every day.

133
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,857
Scott: Oh, yeah, I'm worried about you, dude.

134
00:07:20,897 --> 00:07:23,448
Rym: We should message scojo every day and be like, oh my god.

135
00:07:23,468 --> 00:07:23,910
Rym: Are you okay?

136
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,061
Rym: I heard you had to drive to work.

137
00:07:25,284 --> 00:07:27,414
Scott: Yeah, it's Cuz they like.

138
00:07:27,816 --> 00:07:30,490
Scott: in all seriousness driving is fucking dangerous.

139
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,156
Scott: Like I am scared things.

140
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:35,247
Scott: I'm scared of getting in a car being near a car cars.

141
00:07:36,171 --> 00:07:39,170
Rym: I'm less afraid of a car than biking nice to car.

142
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:46,216
Rym: I mean if I list the things that I'm literally actually not joking scared of Leases cars are like the top of the list.

143
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:52,117
Scott: terrorist bombing me is so even though it just fucking happened is So far down the list.

144
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:56,655
Scott: I'm more scared of like an animal in Bed bugs.

145
00:07:56,897 --> 00:08:01,267
Rym: Yeah, I was about to say my list is number one I'm afraid of being hit by a car while riding my bike.

146
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:04,280
Rym: number two Being hit by a car while walking on the sidewalk.

147
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,050
Rym: number three car four car five car truck.

148
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,590
Rym: six bedbugs.

149
00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:12,996
Rym: seven stabbin hobo ATSA.

150
00:08:13,097 --> 00:08:14,249
Rym: nine regular cops.

151
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,781
Scott: Terrorist is so not something I'm afraid of.

152
00:08:19,902 --> 00:08:26,728
Rym: if terrorists bombed New York and killed a person Every single day of the year in order to move I would still be more afraid of cars than a bomb.

153
00:08:26,748 --> 00:08:33,715
Scott: in order to move Up the list terrorist would have to like be so smart and be so much more frequent Than they have ever been.

154
00:08:33,735 --> 00:08:37,710
Rym: and at that point then, you know, that's when weird stuff happens and things change.

155
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:43,729
Rym: I mean, I've I've spent a lot of time in places where that sort of thing happens and it sucks And I don't want America to get to that point.

156
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:49,741
Rym: Yeah I don't want to go through a metal detector to go to the mall and you know what we won't have to if you suburban People aren't so afraid.

157
00:08:49,782 --> 00:08:53,701
Scott: if you stop being afraid Then you won't want to put up a metal detector because you'd be.

158
00:08:53,862 --> 00:08:55,870
Scott: I'm ready to get on a plane with no security whatsoever.

159
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,225
Scott: Yeah, I will walk onto a plane the way you walk onto the subway.

160
00:08:59,245 --> 00:09:00,370
Scott: I don't give a fuck.

161
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,401
Rym: So it's like that in Singapore Scott.

162
00:09:02,602 --> 00:09:11,816
Rym: when you go to the airport to Singapore You'll you'll just like you check in and then you're walking and you're walking and you're walking and then you realize you never hit a security Line, you're just literally at your gate.

163
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:15,209
Scott: That's how airplanes were in the US and then you know what they do.

164
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:21,507
Rym: There's one metal detector at the door to the jetway and you just go through that metal detector.

165
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,076
Scott: getting on the plane I'll go in without the metal detect.

166
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:24,840
Scott: I mean, I'm okay with it.

167
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:34,929
Rym: I don't give a shit, but Like bang for your buck and bang for your inconvenience metal detector is like one of the greatest.

168
00:09:34,989 --> 00:09:44,504
Scott: yeah No, I mean, I'm not gonna say get rid of the metal detector But I'm saying if it wasn't there I would still get on the plane except when the TSA They actually did get rid of the metal detector.

169
00:09:44,644 --> 00:09:45,066
Rym: They did.

170
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:48,957
Rym: Yeah anyway We're fine guys.

171
00:09:48,997 --> 00:09:49,601
Rym: You got any news?

172
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:52,718
Scott: I do have a news For people who don't know.

173
00:09:52,839 --> 00:10:01,195
Scott: right now and I think it's in Germany There's an event called photo Kina and photo Kina is basically it's like the packs of cameras Right.

174
00:10:01,215 --> 00:10:02,985
Scott: This is where all the camera companies announced.

175
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:05,782
Rym: So what's the Photokina thon finale.

176
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:11,903
Scott: I don't know But there were mad tons of camera announcement type things, right?

177
00:10:11,943 --> 00:10:14,110
Scott: So there's the GoPro Hero 5. we knew was coming.

178
00:10:14,351 --> 00:10:15,276
Scott: It's out to be it's good.

179
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:17,628
Scott: It's mad waterproof without any case on it.

180
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:22,630
Scott: All the other GoPro did to put like a plastic thing around this one you can just throw in the fucking ocean.

181
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:27,630
Scott: I might get one because I have a GoPro - I'm Bob and it's so busted and old.

182
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,150
Rym: I'm gonna go like I use my GoPro - a few times.

183
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:31,133
Scott: I use it a lot.

184
00:10:31,294 --> 00:10:33,482
Rym: when it came out the video quality was amazing.

185
00:10:33,522 --> 00:10:35,650
Rym: But by modern standards, it looks like shit.

186
00:10:35,772 --> 00:10:36,589
Scott: It does look like shit.

187
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,634
Rym: So and like.

188
00:10:37,675 --> 00:10:41,110
Rym: it's so bad that I can't use it as like a backup camera at our panels.

189
00:10:41,692 --> 00:10:44,546
Rym: But the new GoPro like that's better than the camcorder.

190
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,410
Scott: I mean I can use it.

191
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,830
Scott: I mean it the new ones gonna be better, but if I use for what it costs, right?

192
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,210
Scott: It's like 400 bucks to get the top of the line one.

193
00:10:51,398 --> 00:10:52,695
Scott: Yeah It's like it's a deal right.

194
00:10:52,736 --> 00:11:00,630
Scott: and then they also announced the GoPro's official drone Which looks to be like as far as drones go a really fucking good drone, but what am I gonna do with the drone?

195
00:11:01,753 --> 00:11:02,656
Scott: Get it confiscated.

196
00:11:03,098 --> 00:11:09,022
Rym: Here's what I would do with the drone and it's the most compelling use case I have is I would have it follow me skiing.

197
00:11:09,483 --> 00:11:11,370
Scott: I don't think this one can follow you on its own.

198
00:11:11,552 --> 00:11:12,647
Scott: It's a remote control by hand.

199
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,229
Rym: Yeah Well in that case to get a friend to do it.

200
00:11:14,551 --> 00:11:17,630
Rym: But I actually I would just buy one of the fancy ones that follows you because those exist.

201
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:21,224
Rym: The problem is every ski resort in the world is banned drones.

202
00:11:21,304 --> 00:11:22,710
Scott: Yeah, it'll fucking kill somebody.

203
00:11:23,335 --> 00:11:23,939
Rym: Probably not.

204
00:11:24,403 --> 00:11:24,705
Rym: Uh-huh.

205
00:11:25,028 --> 00:11:31,530
Scott: So So here's the problem little gust of wind blows someone skiing real fast up spinning blade in the face.

206
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,844
Rym: Well one the drones fly real high like, you know, they're not like be right behind you.

207
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:37,530
Scott: Well, it's a GoPro camera.

208
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,638
Scott: It's got a wide-angle lens.

209
00:11:38,658 --> 00:11:39,443
Scott: You want to get it close?

210
00:11:39,624 --> 00:11:47,550
Scott: Yeah Anyway, because we use it to spy on other announcements that they announced the Panasonic gh5 will be out early next year.

211
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:50,907
Rym: It's meaning if you want a badass camera wait until that time and buy the gh4.

212
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:56,090
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's better than the gh4 but it's not better in a way that'll matter to most people.

213
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,741
Scott: It's like do you really need your 4k at 60 FPS instead of 30?

214
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:02,329
Scott: Maybe you know, do you really need for two to?

215
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:07,630
Scott: 10-bit color instead of four to oh eight bit color Recorded to the SD card.

216
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:22,575
Rym: I mean most people who need the extra two bits of color are using external recorders anyway Actually, so if we were doing a lot more green-screen compositing stuff, that would be real fucking useful Maybe but we don't like I don't care Green screen back there.

217
00:12:22,595 --> 00:12:23,097
Rym: I'm not gonna.

218
00:12:23,218 --> 00:12:26,129
Scott: yeah, it can do like there's a 4k photo mode or two gh4.

219
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,784
Scott: Oh, it's like, you know, this is stuff like that.

220
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:32,870
Scott: Yeah There's a lot of in things happening in the world of like Polaroid type cameras.

221
00:12:32,971 --> 00:12:35,870
Scott: Fuji makes this instax film which is basically Polaroid.

222
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,370
Scott: You take a photo the thing goes and comes out and it's been around for a while.

223
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:46,023
Scott: But they've got like a new camera and they I think Like is also making a more expensive version of the same exact camera.

224
00:12:46,043 --> 00:12:47,027
Scott: that but it cost more money.

225
00:12:47,047 --> 00:12:47,870
Scott: cuz there's like on it.

226
00:12:48,254 --> 00:12:49,287
Scott: Oh, yeah, right.

227
00:12:50,511 --> 00:12:57,559
Rym: So so totally the side but I was looking at the G if I got the gh4 and a decent lens For only a little bit more money.

228
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,230
Rym: There's this Sony like for real studio camcorder.

229
00:13:00,971 --> 00:13:06,109
Scott: That is just like a studio camera Tons of studio camcorders that are really great.

230
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:11,850
Rym: But there's this one Sony one that's real great and cost about the same as a gh4 plus a good lens.

231
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:16,949
Scott: I mean if you really need a quality camera the Sony a7s is still like the king of.

232
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:19,202
Scott: yeah It's like the best you can see in the darts amazing.

233
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:20,792
Scott: It costs $4,000.

234
00:13:20,792 --> 00:13:22,882
Rym: Yeah, then we don't how often you need to see us in the.

235
00:13:23,023 --> 00:13:24,370
Rym: actually the panel rooms are pretty dark.

236
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,253
Rym: That would be useful.

237
00:13:25,314 --> 00:13:31,357
Scott: but would you announced a mirrorless camera that has like an enormous almost, you know Like medium format sensor, it's like huge.

238
00:13:31,437 --> 00:13:35,570
Scott: I guess Hasselblad already has a mirrorless camera with a giant sensor on it.

239
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,037
Scott: So people are making big old sensors.

240
00:13:38,057 --> 00:13:54,684
Scott: There's all kinds of real interesting stuff is happening and it's interesting to see how like Even though like CP cuz cuz camera making these days digital camera making is really closely tied to like Moore's law Cuz you're making sensors or this basically the same as CPUs, right?

241
00:13:54,724 --> 00:13:56,370
Scott: It's like we're printing on silica.

242
00:13:56,511 --> 00:14:06,690
Scott: It's the same kind of process similar right and you know How come we're still managing to make huge advancements in camera land and we're not making this huge advancements in CPU land?

243
00:14:07,394 --> 00:14:09,024
Rym: Well, they're not general purpose.

244
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:10,030
Scott: That's true.

245
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:13,644
Rym: I mean, it's kind of like good like, you know video cards and CUDA processing and all that.

246
00:14:13,925 --> 00:14:16,717
Rym: because you're not general purpose You can be real efficient.

247
00:14:16,777 --> 00:14:18,124
Scott: Well, I don't think they're being.

248
00:14:18,144 --> 00:14:19,530
Scott: I don't think video cards are efficient.

249
00:14:19,611 --> 00:14:30,210
Scott: I thought video cards are more like monster, you know, like What's it called well the old voodoo cards like that, yeah, it's like, you know, it's like a. You know, it's like a Hot Wheels, right?

250
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:30,551
Scott: It's like you.

251
00:14:30,571 --> 00:14:33,063
Scott: just I just you know, put the biggest fucking engine in there.

252
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:34,510
Scott: Who cares how fuel-efficient it is.

253
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,895
Scott: Just go as fast as possible.

254
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:36,196
Scott: Right?

255
00:14:36,216 --> 00:14:43,689
Scott: Whereas the CPU is actually trying to be like efficient with the electricity usage It's like GPUs got its own like power cables coming into it.

256
00:14:45,692 --> 00:14:51,483
Rym: So in other actually semi-related news Netflix has this meridian test footage.

257
00:14:51,945 --> 00:15:11,700
Rym: That is like a benchmark video to be used to test things like end-to-end processing or video pipelines or 4k TVs or whatever and They're releasing it Apparently Creative Commons so that anyone can use it to make it like this super official Standard for testing video pipelines.

258
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,870
Scott: So it's basically just a video.

259
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:16,297
Rym: It's there's a little more to it.

260
00:15:16,317 --> 00:15:19,970
Scott: the same way everyone uses that picture of the the lady with the hat for photo.

261
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:21,949
Rym: Yeah, our testing it's kind of like that.

262
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:28,710
Rym: But there's a lot more supporting data and stuff behind it and they're basically releasing the whole thing just to make everyone's lives better.

263
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,662
Rym: So everyone can use it for all their testing and codex.

264
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:41,776
Rym: So just like an AVI file or something I don't know what format it actually comes in because the problem with the article I'm looking at is that I click through all The sub articles.

265
00:15:42,238 --> 00:15:45,789
Rym: they still don't get me - oh there it is here I can download it.

266
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:49,942
Rym: It's a bunch of XML files and MXF files.

267
00:15:50,223 --> 00:15:52,630
Rym: I'm sure which are UHD format.

268
00:15:52,991 --> 00:15:57,804
Scott: I'm sure premiere knows what to do with it meridian shrc and xx us and nr.

269
00:15:57,804 --> 00:16:01,778
Rym: 51 LTRT UHD Ovie, oh my god.

270
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:03,887
Rym: So this video is 89 gigabytes.

271
00:16:04,369 --> 00:16:06,693
Rym: Sure Maybe I'll.

272
00:16:06,713 --> 00:16:08,379
Rym: uh, I guess it's creative Commons.

273
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,467
Rym: I'll just stream it every day and make a channel.

274
00:16:10,507 --> 00:16:10,969
Rym: That's what I do.

275
00:16:11,695 --> 00:16:12,809
Scott: How are you gonna store this thing?

276
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:15,249
Rym: Any of my hard drives?

277
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:19,552
Scott: And you're on a terabyte hard drive that will take up 10%.

278
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:24,014
Rym: I've got ish that much space but the NAS does not have that much space, you know You don't need.

279
00:16:24,034 --> 00:16:25,340
Scott: you don't need this video though.

280
00:16:25,802 --> 00:16:26,586
Rym: No, I'm not gonna download.

281
00:16:26,606 --> 00:16:26,968
Rym: What am I gonna?

282
00:16:26,988 --> 00:16:27,390
Rym: what about what?

283
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:30,950
Rym: Our video pipeline is so babies first as it is.

284
00:16:32,252 --> 00:16:35,650
Rym: So in other news, this is just kind of cool so I just want to highlight it real quick.

285
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:41,496
Rym: but if you have an Apple - There's no s update you can download.

286
00:16:41,516 --> 00:16:46,313
Rym: perhaps an Apple - you can download protoss 2.4 Yes, and install it.

287
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:54,827
Scott: Yes, and it actually adds a lot of functionality to the Apple - yes I know there's no an Apple - really doesn't have an operating system so much.

288
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,707
Scott: It just sort of boots off, you know ROM or disk drive the old days.

289
00:16:58,727 --> 00:16:59,310
Rym: We had a game.

290
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:04,981
Scott: You'd basically boot the game right anyway But you put a floppy disk in there and you turn it on.

291
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:09,319
Scott: it automatically starts loading the disk into the RAM And then it runs it.

292
00:17:09,482 --> 00:17:10,510
Scott: that's how it works, right?

293
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,979
Scott: Yeah, if you want to switch you get to flip the disk over.

294
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,653
Scott: it unloads most of the first disk from the RAM mostly You know.

295
00:17:16,673 --> 00:17:20,170
Scott: you put the second disk in it loads that off the disk and then you're good to go.

296
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,003
Scott: So so the best the biggest on the disk.

297
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:28,190
Scott: you would put protoss Right that - as like the thing that you put on the disk along with all your software.

298
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:33,531
Scott: So if you put a disk in your Apple - and you turn your Apple - on it says do protoss and then your game starts Loading.

299
00:17:33,932 --> 00:17:47,089
Rym: so the main feature they add in this release is bitsy by which is a menu driven program Launcher that allows for navigation through files across multiple floppy disks and then someone added or hack USB floppy disks.

300
00:17:48,112 --> 00:17:53,050
Rym: The way actually, you know the runs in less than a kilobyte of RAM leaving plenty of room to actually run.

301
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:58,615
Scott: I have a RAM expansion in my Apple - GS which already has more RAM than your average Apple - you know I load software.

302
00:17:58,635 --> 00:18:00,790
Scott: I'm Apple - there's two really clever ways.

303
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,930
Scott: I do it because I have I have five and a quarter inch floppy disk drives now, but they're they work.

304
00:18:06,091 --> 00:18:07,317
Scott: Okay, they don't work great.

305
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,222
Scott: I don't.

306
00:18:08,283 --> 00:18:09,610
Scott: I can't get the three and a half inch one.

307
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:13,170
Scott: They're actually hard to come by the drives and the disks for that even though that's the best way.

308
00:18:13,774 --> 00:18:14,661
Scott: There's two other methods.

309
00:18:14,721 --> 00:18:28,470
Scott: I use method number one I take my iPhone or something and I take a headphone cable and I go out of my iPhone and into the back of the Apple - and then I Find a WAV file of the software and press play and it's like a cassette tape.

310
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,750
Scott: They used to be able to load software from cassette tapes, right?

311
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:37,670
Scott: So I can set tape can be turned into a WAV file and I just play the WAV file at full volume on my phone.

312
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:41,490
Scott: The Apple listens to it thinks it's a cassette tape and then you have software.

313
00:18:41,831 --> 00:18:51,835
Scott: the other way I do it is I have a cable a fancy cable and one end is USB on my real computer and on the other end is The thing that you would.

314
00:18:52,156 --> 00:18:56,330
Scott: that would the cable that would come out of a modem if you got a modem for your Apple - GS.

315
00:18:56,892 --> 00:19:13,570
Scott: so then I type some stuff on the Apple - and press enter and then I run some software on my computer and point it at a file and I say computer that file send it and it sends that file over the USB and the Apple - thinks it's getting a file from the modem over the telephone.

316
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:16,590
Scott: It has no idea that this is a modern computer.

317
00:19:18,395 --> 00:19:20,923
Scott: And then boom Oregon trails on the Apple - screen.

318
00:19:21,525 --> 00:19:23,370
Scott: so those are my two methods of loading software.

319
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,834
Rym: I'm Apple - the other cool thing.

320
00:19:24,874 --> 00:19:27,260
Rym: It's got is a boot utility.

321
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,744
Rym: That's under 400 bytes.

322
00:19:28,764 --> 00:19:32,874
Rym: So it'll fit on one block of storage and Yeah, that's it.

323
00:19:32,894 --> 00:19:33,798
Rym: This is just super cool.

324
00:19:34,462 --> 00:19:35,125
Scott: I don't know that.

325
00:19:35,145 --> 00:19:35,929
Scott: maybe I'll load this up.

326
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,015
Rym: You probably should.

327
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,730
Rym: now if you don't happen to have an Apple - laying around.

328
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:41,274
Rym: There's a link on this.

329
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:49,730
Rym: the thing I'm linking to where there's an online full web emulator where you can just pretend you've got an Apple - and run whatever arbitrary applications on it all in your browser.

330
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:56,509
Scott: Yeah, I think the thing that you want if you're the software if anyone's wondering I think it's called ADT Is the thing that you use to load, you know?

331
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,297
Scott: Connect between a modern computer and an Apple computer.

332
00:19:59,337 --> 00:20:03,950
Scott: an old Apple - I also have a Mac plus but that is harder to interface.

333
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:08,682
Scott: Even though it's a newer better computer than Apple - actually think it might well.

334
00:20:08,702 --> 00:20:14,336
Scott: the one I have is has one megabyte of RAM It's not a 512 K. It's basically the same computer as a Mac.

335
00:20:14,336 --> 00:20:18,769
Scott: 512 K only has a megabyte of RAM and a better screen and it looks better.

336
00:20:20,013 --> 00:20:22,770
Scott: But that's harder to interface with modern computers.

337
00:20:29,871 --> 00:20:32,861
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

338
00:20:33,142 --> 00:20:35,048
Rym: so it's computer buying season.

339
00:20:35,188 --> 00:20:37,421
Rym: I mean Scott bought a new HD PC.

340
00:20:37,441 --> 00:20:38,770
Rym: a bunch of our friends bought new computers.

341
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,600
Scott: I mean way CPC is so fast like every game is a Pam.

342
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,181
Rym: Yep.

343
00:20:42,864 --> 00:20:44,610
Rym: Emily's upgrading the hard drives in her PC.

344
00:20:44,991 --> 00:20:46,475
Rym: I bought a bunch of PCs for work.

345
00:20:46,736 --> 00:20:50,486
Rym: I'm real close to upgrading my PC and it's it's time.

346
00:20:50,506 --> 00:20:51,710
Scott: Does anyone want my old HD PC?

347
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,898
Scott: It's like it's not bad.

348
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:54,009
Scott: It just isn't fast.

349
00:20:54,806 --> 00:21:06,749
Scott: Yeah If you just want to watch videos on your TV and play games that aren't super fancy 3d like it can play rocket league at Low frames my HDPC performs worse playing rocket league than my laptop does.

350
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:09,966
Scott: Yeah, but you know, it's it's not bad, you know.

351
00:21:10,006 --> 00:21:11,889
Scott: as an HD PC My old one is still great.

352
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:17,636
Scott: In fact, if you took out the magnetic drive and put an SSD or just add an SSD It would probably.

353
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,365
Scott: that's probably most of the slowness right there.

354
00:21:19,406 --> 00:21:20,009
Scott: Is that Drive?

355
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:23,066
Scott: You know so and you could get a newer low.

356
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:29,537
Scott: It can only take low profile video cards because of the case but it has an old Radeon like something garbage II.

357
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:41,260
Scott: you could put in I think a Nvidia 740 because those come in low profile mine at least and it would be 460. it would be a little better if you did that, you know, it wouldn't be much better, but it would be better.

358
00:21:42,471 --> 00:21:46,370
Rym: Anyway, well the reason I haven't you know, we've talked about like what computer I would buy.

359
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,869
Rym: We've done bunch of shows on that recently, but this is just a YouTube channel.

360
00:21:49,191 --> 00:21:52,989
Rym: It's kind of generic YouTube YouTube channel with all the YouTube YouTube stuff in it.

361
00:21:53,572 --> 00:21:57,650
Rym: But if you don't know the stuff like what's this?

362
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,157
Rym: What good CPU should I buy?

363
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,690
Rym: or what the hell is a PCI Express lane?

364
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:05,125
Rym: And why does this motherboard have 20 and this has 16 and all that kind of crap.

365
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:14,410
Rym: Ah You should just go to this channel and watch these videos because the reason we're not gonna do videos like this Is that I was gonna do a few but these guys much better more production value.

366
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:20,858
Rym: well The thing is this is a level of knowledge that you only have if you're basically constantly currently building computers Like they have.

367
00:22:20,878 --> 00:22:27,727
Rym: like that's your thing Yeah, or you're literally going through the process right now and then your information is obsolete almost immediately.

368
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:38,890
Rym: Like if you ask me in 2001 I could make every one of these videos for the technology in 2001 but in 2003 Fuck if I know I'm gonna watch a video like this, right?

369
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:44,335
Scott: But yeah, if you need to know about what's going on in the hobby the nerdy hobby of computer building This.

370
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:44,799
Scott: these are.

371
00:22:44,819 --> 00:22:46,090
Scott: this is a really good YouTube channel.

372
00:22:46,391 --> 00:22:48,859
Scott: I watch their video on thermal paste cuz like.

373
00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:49,782
Scott: should I get some?

374
00:22:49,823 --> 00:22:50,706
Scott: do I need some?

375
00:22:50,766 --> 00:22:51,890
Rym: Yes, you do need some.

376
00:22:52,512 --> 00:22:57,990
Scott: Well, apparently if you get the if you use the Intel stock cooler the built-in stuff that's on the bottom is just fine.

377
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,773
Scott: You don't need any more.

378
00:22:58,793 --> 00:23:02,407
Rym: So the one I'm linking to is what CPU should I buy?

379
00:23:02,467 --> 00:23:11,010
Rym: Because the thing is There's a lot of CPUs out there and with every generation There's only a couple that are worth buying and most of them are literally like worthless.

380
00:23:11,812 --> 00:23:14,089
Rym: And the video does a really good job of explaining why?

381
00:23:15,612 --> 00:23:16,580
Rym: So you got a thing of the day.

382
00:23:16,841 --> 00:23:17,305
Scott: I do so.

383
00:23:17,325 --> 00:23:17,688
Scott: it's just.

384
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:20,807
Scott: you know It's a typical internet kind of nice good feeling video.

385
00:23:20,847 --> 00:23:25,070
Scott: somebody This person has a YouTube channel where they do the domino projects.

386
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:28,990
Scott: You set up a bunch of dominoes and knock them down and if you in a beautiful fashion, that's a hobby.

387
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,250
Scott: I do not have the patience and I think she said this at the end of the video.

388
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,315
Scott: I didn't watch it again.

389
00:23:33,335 --> 00:23:33,877
Scott: So I don't remember.

390
00:23:33,898 --> 00:23:41,230
Scott: I think she said this is a third biggest project ever Third biggest thousands and thousands of dominoes and in this crazy awesome spiral.

391
00:23:41,431 --> 00:23:46,430
Scott: So it was really fun to watch this and mesmerizing and took a lot of effort set it up.

392
00:23:46,611 --> 00:23:48,787
Scott: I'm sure I would not have the patience and I would not do it.

393
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,346
Scott: I'm sure I would knock it over like a thousand times.

394
00:23:51,427 --> 00:23:53,729
Rym: as a kid I did not have the patience for domino rally.

395
00:23:53,810 --> 00:24:02,488
Rym: We had domino rally and there is a machine that would even like lay your dominoes down for you And I still could not deal with that crap, right?

396
00:24:02,548 --> 00:24:04,815
Scott: So You know what?

397
00:24:04,855 --> 00:24:07,726
Scott: You just get all the benefits without the work by watching on YouTube.

398
00:24:07,987 --> 00:24:08,530
Scott: Yeah, here you go.

399
00:24:08,811 --> 00:24:17,504
Rym: I guess the only benefit you don't get is being in the room and hearing that like clicking live locally Yeah, but I mean you don't get the benefit of being the person who knocks it over.

400
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:17,605
Scott: Yeah.

401
00:24:18,006 --> 00:24:21,810
Scott: Yeah It's like how satisfying must it be to hit that first domino with your hand?

402
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,255
Rym: Oh, has someone ever kick-started that?

403
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:27,311
Rym: just kick-start like I'm gonna make a big fucking domino and whoever gives the most money gets to start It.

404
00:24:27,873 --> 00:24:34,657
Rym: yeah, and just keep doing that over and over again and just live your life being the domino guy Back back if someone hasn't done that yet.

405
00:24:34,717 --> 00:24:38,533
Rym: I think there's room in the world for one person doing that Maybe.

406
00:24:38,594 --> 00:24:45,832
Rym: so if it doesn't already exist and you don't want to go to college There's your life In The better moment.

407
00:24:46,012 --> 00:24:49,002
Rym: we got no conventions till magfest which is coming up in January.

408
00:24:49,022 --> 00:24:49,785
Rym: good.

409
00:24:49,825 --> 00:24:50,327
Rym: We'll be there.

410
00:24:50,607 --> 00:24:51,350
Rym: We're mages again.

411
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,205
Rym: We'll be on all those like gaming magic missile.

412
00:24:54,407 --> 00:24:58,423
Rym: Yeah 1d4 plus your level or whatever.

413
00:24:58,483 --> 00:24:59,550
Scott: egg fest attacks darkness.

414
00:25:00,213 --> 00:25:02,643
Rym: I'm really looking forward to magfest because I love packs.

415
00:25:02,683 --> 00:25:02,945
Rym: we go to.

416
00:25:02,965 --> 00:25:06,839
Rym: a lot of packs is but Magfest is the con that has I don't know.

417
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,582
Rym: There's something about.

418
00:25:07,622 --> 00:25:09,208
Rym: just for him dig-dug.

419
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:13,243
Rym: Yeah I got a Scott beat me pretty hard and dig-dug a pack.

420
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:13,986
Rym: So I got a reclaim.

421
00:25:14,066 --> 00:25:17,720
Rym: I played dig-dug recently I had not and it showed real bad.

422
00:25:17,801 --> 00:25:18,303
Rym: I got ready.

423
00:25:18,443 --> 00:25:20,009
Scott: I'll play a little dig-dug on my new HD PC.

424
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:23,156
Rym: Oh, I think my HD PC can run dig-dug.

425
00:25:23,757 --> 00:25:26,263
Scott: So I think it can go to magfest.

426
00:25:26,444 --> 00:25:27,045
Rym: We'll be there.

427
00:25:27,366 --> 00:25:30,334
Rym: Otherwise, uh, Nothing, we're just doing our stuff again.

428
00:25:30,415 --> 00:25:32,923
Rym: So I'll check out Scott's YouTube channel.

429
00:25:32,943 --> 00:25:34,087
Rym: Check out my youtube channel.

430
00:25:34,128 --> 00:25:34,750
Rym: Check out all our stuff.

431
00:25:35,231 --> 00:25:35,532
Rym: Scott.

432
00:25:35,873 --> 00:25:36,916
Rym: rate and subscribe.

433
00:25:37,157 --> 00:25:38,642
Rym: Yeah, got a rate and subscribe.

434
00:25:38,782 --> 00:25:39,886
Scott: Don't do any of those things.

435
00:25:39,966 --> 00:25:41,230
Rym: sign up for the GeekNights loot crate.

436
00:25:41,511 --> 00:25:42,935
Scott: No, we don't have one.

437
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:43,698
Scott: Thank God Scott.

438
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,484
Rym: No, that's the test genius.

439
00:25:46,005 --> 00:25:47,450
Rym: Let's make a GeekNights loot crate.

440
00:25:47,592 --> 00:25:48,056
Scott: It's all the shit.

441
00:25:48,077 --> 00:25:49,330
Scott: We want to get rid of in our apartment.

442
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:52,524
Rym: Yeah, you'll get like all my old tech books over there one week.

443
00:25:52,564 --> 00:25:53,810
Scott: Oh my god, we should do this.

444
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,275
Scott: This is actually a good idea.

445
00:25:55,295 --> 00:25:56,419
Rym: My sign up for it, too.

446
00:25:56,439 --> 00:25:57,644
Scott: Oh my god.

447
00:25:57,664 --> 00:25:58,286
Scott: I have so much.

448
00:25:58,386 --> 00:25:59,917
Scott: It's mostly comic books You're gonna get.

449
00:25:59,998 --> 00:26:10,796
Scott: you're gonna get comic books But you're gonna get like a GTX for you know What one person's gonna get initially volume one and someone else is gonna get initially volume three, dude Someone's gonna be the same person.

450
00:26:10,996 --> 00:26:13,384
Rym: Someone's gonna get a whole bunch of batteries.

451
00:26:13,444 --> 00:26:14,427
Rym: I don't need anymore.

452
00:26:14,588 --> 00:26:15,029
Scott: Oh my god.

453
00:26:15,913 --> 00:26:20,530
Rym: The rule would be it won't actually be garbage and have to be something that has some actual value.

454
00:26:20,711 --> 00:26:21,934
Scott: I will we should.

455
00:26:22,175 --> 00:26:22,957
Scott: I mean the price.

456
00:26:22,977 --> 00:26:27,430
Scott: the subscription would basically be like the price of shipping plus a dollar per month.

457
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:33,770
Scott: Yep, and I would send you like two things per person because it doesn't cause more to ship two things than one thing.

458
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:35,609
Scott: Yeah, anything that you know what we do?

459
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:39,944
Scott: The stuff would always fit in a UPS flat rate whatever.

460
00:26:40,005 --> 00:26:41,210
Scott: so the price doesn't change.

461
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,535
Scott: Yeah, and us only.

462
00:26:42,555 --> 00:26:44,583
Rym: I think that I think we could do this.

463
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:46,350
Scott: I can get rid of all my garbage.

464
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:47,794
Rym: Yeah, but it's garbage.

465
00:26:47,834 --> 00:26:50,081
Rym: That's what has a non zero monitor.

466
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:51,947
Scott: Otherwise, it would just go in the garbage.

467
00:26:52,007 --> 00:26:53,880
Scott: Literally this stuff I don't want anymore.

468
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,810
Scott: That's probably nerdy.

469
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:58,061
Rym: I got a lot of like plastic figures and that kind of stuff books.

470
00:26:58,563 --> 00:27:02,674
Rym: Yeah a lot of books, you know stuff Looking around this room.

471
00:27:02,734 --> 00:27:05,845
Rym: I see like a hundred things that would immediately go in there.

472
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:07,229
Scott: Oh my god, maybe we should do this.

473
00:27:08,113 --> 00:27:09,509
Rym: What do you might get a parsec award?

474
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:19,209
Rym: So in typical fashion we looked around the room until we came up with a show topic for today.

475
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:22,182
Rym: Mm-hmm, and what's in that bookshelf way over there?

476
00:27:22,202 --> 00:27:24,090
Rym: a whole bunch of O'Reilly books.

477
00:27:24,471 --> 00:27:25,836
Scott: I hope we haven't done this show already.

478
00:27:26,097 --> 00:27:30,010
Rym: Well tech books in general, you know, those sort of like any book.

479
00:27:30,171 --> 00:27:31,777
Rym: I think I think we're gonna qualify this.

480
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:34,107
Rym: are we just talking like computer technology?

481
00:27:34,127 --> 00:27:36,430
Rym: because I have other Techno like I have electronics books.

482
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,107
Scott: I mean, let's just do what we can right and get the show over with.

483
00:27:39,268 --> 00:27:53,241
Rym: yeah but the books that are technical references to things typically O'Reilly books or like the books you get to pass your CCNA or whatever anything in the section of the bookstore where those books are The kind of book that your company like even die.

484
00:27:53,261 --> 00:27:56,739
Scott: even dummy books like the air the dummy book At least the ones that are by technology.

485
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:07,770
Rym: I've always been kind of deeply bothered by the existence of the dummy books Because they basically say I am a person who self identifies as a moron.

486
00:28:08,091 --> 00:28:12,890
Rym: Who wants someone else to treat me like I'm an idiot and teach me superficial things about something.

487
00:28:13,051 --> 00:28:13,795
Scott: Yeah, but you know what?

488
00:28:14,661 --> 00:28:21,690
Scott: I only ever bought one of those in like 1996 I don't know how to make do mods about JavaScript for dummies cuz you know what?

489
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,570
Scott: It was the only JavaScript book in the bookstore.

490
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:30,086
Rym: It's not like I could go to Amazon and buy a book But then I bought this other do mod book that was way better and way more technical.

491
00:28:30,106 --> 00:28:34,053
Rym: and then I made do mods so Back in the day.

492
00:28:34,073 --> 00:28:42,481
Scott: We used to have to used to have to buy these right because even though you know for certain things You were working on there were references you could get online.

493
00:28:42,581 --> 00:28:48,379
Scott: even in the slow crappy dial-up internet days Those references often were not complete.

494
00:28:48,821 --> 00:28:50,006
Scott: They didn't tell you everything.

495
00:28:50,106 --> 00:28:51,030
Rym: they were out of date.

496
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:55,570
Scott: They were added or they were just API documentation, but not actually teaching you anything.

497
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:56,538
Scott: Right, like you can go.

498
00:28:56,558 --> 00:28:57,727
Rym: list of all the functions.

499
00:28:57,787 --> 00:29:01,527
Scott: great Yeah, you can get the job Java API docs, but that won't teach you Java.

500
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:04,410
Scott: You need to know Java to make use of that, right?

501
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:09,430
Scott: So you'd need another book to teach you Java and there was nowhere to just learn Java.

502
00:29:09,671 --> 00:29:10,574
Scott: Yeah out of nothing.

503
00:29:10,755 --> 00:29:13,103
Rym: and back then there weren't like videos online.

504
00:29:13,144 --> 00:29:13,485
Rym: It wasn't.

505
00:29:13,665 --> 00:29:14,549
Scott: it was no YouTube.

506
00:29:14,609 --> 00:29:17,658
Rym: yet Academy there was no just no just.

507
00:29:17,838 --> 00:29:18,783
Rym: hey you want to learn Python.

508
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:19,988
Rym: Here's an emulator in a browser.

509
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:20,369
Rym: Let's go.

510
00:29:20,811 --> 00:29:24,846
Scott: Yeah, so nowadays you don't really need these books because books are nowadays.

511
00:29:24,866 --> 00:29:31,730
Scott: even if you get the books They're out of date and they're useless and the internet has much better reference and there's nothing in the book that the internet won't have.

512
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,515
Rym: Well, you've already hit on.

513
00:29:32,535 --> 00:29:33,561
Rym: I think we need to separate.

514
00:29:33,642 --> 00:29:38,130
Scott: already in the olden days The book was the best and the internet was kind of not helpful.

515
00:29:38,412 --> 00:29:38,835
Rym: So, you know how?

516
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:43,276
Rym: with board games like in that game rules panel We talked specifically about how they're.

517
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:49,050
Rym: the rules of a game serve two functions the teaching of the game and the reference during the game.

518
00:29:49,492 --> 00:29:51,606
Rym: Teaching and reference are two very different use cases.

519
00:29:51,687 --> 00:30:00,309
Rym: even here I still think there are cases for the teaching side in books But the reference side I don't think there is anymore at all.

520
00:30:00,631 --> 00:30:02,999
Scott: well, the thing is for the reference side.

521
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,988
Scott: the online reference is going to get always gonna be more up-to-date and better.

522
00:30:06,109 --> 00:30:18,243
Scott: but You know, sometimes for certain kind of things if you're looking stuff up a lot constantly a book could actually be a well-indexed book Could actually be faster and more efficient.

523
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:31,530
Rym: So based on the quality of the there was a time in my life when I did a lot of DNS DHCP Samba like IT network admin crap because I managed this data center like back at IBM.

524
00:30:31,933 --> 00:30:43,562
Rym: So even if there had been online references where I could look this stuff up Having a book on all that stuff like locally even with little bookmarks in it cuz I wouldn't remember all the weird syntax of setting up like some nonsense Samba whatever.

525
00:30:43,762 --> 00:30:48,930
Rym: all the time, you know and Even if online references were good, I looked this stuff up regularly.

526
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:56,179
Rym: So I just had the book sitting on my desk and if I were doing a job like that today I'd actually just go to Stack Overflow every time.

527
00:30:56,581 --> 00:30:58,448
Rym: but the better solution would be to have that book.

528
00:30:58,488 --> 00:31:04,050
Scott: on my dad There is one small case but that applies to a not insignificant number of people.

529
00:31:04,471 --> 00:31:11,716
Scott: Where when you have to do technical work without any internet access for his military Contractor right like you're stuck in a place.

530
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:16,430
Scott: So there's no internet like in a secret base or a boat hedge funds space.

531
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:22,470
Scott: It's like suddenly you need to program something in like some language and you need documentation.

532
00:31:23,372 --> 00:31:26,728
Scott: If you don't get a book, you're gonna have something printed out because you don't got anything else.

533
00:31:26,828 --> 00:31:31,590
Scott: Yeah Well, you might have downloaded the documentation beforehand and brought it with you on a USB sticker.

534
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:40,877
Rym: Is that the online references which are objectively superior in pretty much every way almost never have an actually useful Form that's downloadable.

535
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:44,210
Rym: Mm-hmm, especially if it's like like even the Python documentation.

536
00:31:44,351 --> 00:31:46,069
Rym: Like you're better off bringing a book on the plane.

537
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,214
Rym: Well, at least on your kindle.

538
00:31:47,234 --> 00:31:54,939
Scott: something people don't know is at least if you have a Linux machine most Linux distributions You know even most Unix is when you install something.

539
00:31:54,959 --> 00:32:01,800
Scott: Let's say you go app get install Apache on a Debian machine, right by default I'm pretty sure it installs the documentation.

540
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:10,364
Scott: you go into user local share doc Apache and the Apache documentation is actually there in HTML form waiting for you.

541
00:32:10,385 --> 00:32:30,964
Scott: And if you look at the default Apache Configuration that comes on a lot of Linux distributions if you app get install Apache and then in your browser go to localhost slash doc you'll actually get the index of all the documentation that's been installed locally because it actually By default, that's one of the folders.

542
00:32:31,044 --> 00:32:31,990
Scott: It's like a web folder.

543
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:38,979
Rym: there was a time when I did that sort of thing all the time because I was always fucking around with like NTP and the best patchy crowd.

544
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:51,166
Scott: and if your Linux machine is set up in this way and you actually use that It's actually really useful because that Documentation will always exactly match the version that you have installed.

545
00:32:51,206 --> 00:32:59,413
Scott: if you app get installed memcache, let's say I don't even know if memcache has documentation, but let's say it does and It installs memcache Documentation.

546
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:03,587
Scott: that memcache documentation will be for the version of memcache that you have just installed.

547
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:08,888
Scott: and if you go online There might be some newer memcache and that documentation might mess you up because your machine has an older one.

548
00:33:08,949 --> 00:33:16,964
Scott: that is Every time you go to the memcache website to look at the documentation We'd have to click through to say show me the old version.

549
00:33:17,225 --> 00:33:18,410
Scott: This is the version I have.

550
00:33:18,671 --> 00:33:22,090
Scott: But if you go to the localhost documentation, well, it's the right version.

551
00:33:22,411 --> 00:33:29,257
Rym: That is a particularly important if you're working on a project where there's a fixed version of the thing you're using Like web frameworks they change all the time or

552
00:33:29,337 --> 00:33:36,410
Scott: even if you use like a you know a stable version a Linux distribution It won't upgrade the software that you have.

553
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,981
Scott: It will give you that newer like.

554
00:33:38,122 --> 00:33:41,648
Scott: vim8 just came out But I don't have vim8 because if I app get install vim I get vim7.

555
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:44,821
Scott: It won't give me vim8 until there's like a newer OS.

556
00:33:45,082 --> 00:33:46,226
Rym: like I remember my last job.

557
00:33:46,246 --> 00:33:47,270
Rym: I was working on this project.

558
00:33:47,351 --> 00:33:53,299
Rym: I was making this big like soap server to do a bunch of soap nonsense and I got this Python library and I wanted to use it.

559
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:59,123
Rym: So I install everything and I go through the tutorial just like let's see how this thing works because I wasn't super up on soap either.

560
00:33:59,143 --> 00:34:04,770
Rym: so I was learning soap and this library and None of the tutorial shit worked at all.

561
00:34:05,233 --> 00:34:11,803
Rym: And I eventually realized that I was using the tutorial online Was the current version and the only version available in my distro was an old version.

562
00:34:12,143 --> 00:34:13,770
Rym: so I upgraded to the newer version.

563
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:21,070
Rym: But then the version I upgraded to was newer than the docs on the website And if I went to the newer version of the docs on the website, there were no tutorials.

564
00:34:22,072 --> 00:34:25,350
Rym: Yeah, all right now the other than I gave up and I used a different library.

565
00:34:25,471 --> 00:34:30,010
Scott: The other thing is that you know people who tend to be really good at writing tend to write books, right?

566
00:34:30,371 --> 00:34:40,429
Scott: so there are a few really famous really historic computer books and The tutorials that are in those books are way better than anything that you're gonna find online.

567
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:44,109
Scott: If you want to learn from a book and not from say a teacher or a class or anything.

568
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:54,447
Scott: They're pretty much the best way to learn certain topics that you're not going to find Anything online because and you know, I mean you could pirate these books online.

569
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:54,870
Scott: That's what you know.

570
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:55,331
Rym: It's like.

571
00:34:55,572 --> 00:35:04,784
Rym: it's like finding historical event and reading the Wikipedia page about it as opposed to reading like a particular Book research and written by a historian.

572
00:35:04,985 --> 00:35:10,241
Scott: Yeah, and yeah, they both have That book online, but you're still reading that book.

573
00:35:10,462 --> 00:35:14,113
Scott: Yeah, so here's the important books that I am aware of that I have read right.

574
00:35:14,133 --> 00:35:24,830
Scott: So the first book is the structure and interpretation of computer programs By Gerald Sussman and Hal Evelson and this book basically has actually been rewritten many times.

575
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:33,764
Scott: You'll you'll see it referred to as s ICP and I think the original one was written for the language called scheme But which is really similar to lisp.

576
00:35:33,804 --> 00:35:40,970
Scott: It's a functional language But this book has been rewritten using different programming languages over and over again.

577
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:44,746
Scott: So you can find s ICP for CS IP CP for Python.

578
00:35:44,766 --> 00:35:51,830
Scott: you can find all these books The original ones the best and this book even though it teaches you scheme a useless computer language effectively.

579
00:35:52,636 --> 00:36:01,050
Scott: If you learn the shit in this book You will learn the fundamental concepts of functional computer programming which applies to all programming.

580
00:36:01,211 --> 00:36:03,802
Scott: So if you can do the shit in this book, you can program in anything.

581
00:36:03,822 --> 00:36:05,529
Scott: Yeah, so it's a really good book.

582
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:08,077
Scott: Other books right?

583
00:36:08,097 --> 00:36:18,850
Scott: There's the C book the C book That started C and if you program the way they program in the C book, you know Which teaches like the standards of the C language?

584
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,596
Scott: That's not what modern C looks like.

585
00:36:21,058 --> 00:36:29,930
Scott: so it really won't help you in a practical sense that way But it will help you be good at understanding how C works, right?

586
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:34,690
Scott: So like, you know, it's it's mechanisms in its design, which is a beautiful thing.

587
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:37,842
Scott: So that's an important book to read even if you don't do it.

588
00:36:38,223 --> 00:36:41,837
Scott: There's a book called Oh What's the name of this book?

589
00:36:41,897 --> 00:36:42,339
Scott: I forget.

590
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:45,070
Scott: let me let me look at you talk about some other book.

591
00:36:45,331 --> 00:36:51,556
Rym: So you think I can't think of any in particular because most of the things I've learned About just computing in general.

592
00:36:52,058 --> 00:36:55,589
Rym: I've learned by reading a specific technical reference and then implementing something.

593
00:36:55,629 --> 00:36:56,212
Rym: Yeah Okay.

594
00:36:56,232 --> 00:36:56,815
Scott: So here's the book.

595
00:36:56,855 --> 00:36:59,250
Scott: So this book is code complete by Steve McConnell.

596
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:05,790
Scott: This is actually like a Microsoft book and it's written mostly from the perspective like Microsoft C++ programming.

597
00:37:05,931 --> 00:37:09,126
Scott: But it doesn't matter because it's not about the language.

598
00:37:09,146 --> 00:37:10,030
Scott: you're learning a language.

599
00:37:10,573 --> 00:37:18,129
Scott: This is a book about coding style like how to name variables and how to organize code and it applies to all programming ever.

600
00:37:18,149 --> 00:37:22,935
Scott: and Like this book is like it's big and you're like, whoa How can I read this giant textbook?

601
00:37:22,955 --> 00:37:28,509
Scott: and it's like no this might be like the most important book You can read as a programming person.

602
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:36,527
Scott: It's it's like if you read this your code will change in the code that people can actually fucking read Without wanting without wanting to kill you.

603
00:37:38,531 --> 00:37:51,990
Scott: There's one other book that was written by an RIT professor and was never Acquired in a class that I took but was recommended in a lot of classes I took and it was somewhat expensive and I was always like, oh, why should I buy the professor's book?

604
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,537
Scott: That's optional and expensive.

605
00:37:53,597 --> 00:37:55,365
Scott: It's not even my professor this guy.

606
00:37:55,465 --> 00:37:56,570
Rym: at least he made it optional.

607
00:37:56,951 --> 00:37:58,155
Scott: Well, I wasn't in his class.

608
00:37:58,235 --> 00:38:13,846
Scott: other other CS professors in the department were telling us to optionally buy the other professor's book and I. it's really hard to get this book and even more expensive now than it was when I bought it because I think it Hasn't been printed in forever, but it's called pointers on C and this book.

609
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:24,675
Scott: I Mean, you know not to shill for the RIT professor But if you don't understand pointers this helps you understand pointers better than any other book That has ever been like.

610
00:38:24,996 --> 00:38:28,351
Rym: it's what it comes down to is, you know in anything you want to read Like.

611
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:32,330
Rym: I've read books that are like that about audio production and those sorts of things.

612
00:38:32,952 --> 00:38:35,701
Rym: Or like using premiere like either go to like do like.

613
00:38:35,721 --> 00:38:38,350
Rym: you can go to a place like digital tutors and watch like a tutorial.

614
00:38:38,812 --> 00:38:42,650
Rym: But tutorials that seems how most people teach and learn technology stuff today.

615
00:38:43,194 --> 00:38:51,770
Rym: They sort of give you a very narrow path Which is very useful if you have a goal and your goal is to complete the goal as opposed to generally learn the thing

616
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:52,713
Scott: Yeah, but

617
00:38:52,814 --> 00:38:57,150
Rym: as opposed to computers like a lot of people can set up a DNS server if they need to.

618
00:38:57,852 --> 00:39:07,205
Rym: But like I studied DNS to where I know the history and the context and like the broad Way the DNS works that does not necessarily help me achieve that particular goal.

619
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:08,530
Rym: In fact, it slows me down.

620
00:39:08,871 --> 00:39:14,730
Rym: Yeah, if you try to learn like why AAA records are different from a records that's gonna slow you down.

621
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,320
Rym: I actually don't set up your go daddy.

622
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,819
Scott: I actually don't know the difference in a AAA is just an IPv6.

623
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,185
Scott: I thought I was about here.

624
00:39:22,205 --> 00:39:28,677
Scott: I was about to guess that I Run into that problem a lot.

625
00:39:28,797 --> 00:39:33,350
Scott: actually with the Photoshop tutorials, right because like I'm not very good at photoshopping.

626
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:35,869
Rym: Oh, and you're like, I just want to do this thing with this layer right now.

627
00:39:36,131 --> 00:39:40,390
Scott: No, I want to like learn Photoshop so I could be like those people who can beat Photoshop.

628
00:39:40,513 --> 00:39:41,128
Scott: Well, right.

629
00:39:41,551 --> 00:39:47,875
Scott: So I go online looking for tutorial and every tutorial is either like here's how to use the brush tool and I'm like I know this.

630
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,994
Scott: move on and then they're like Here's how to make.

631
00:39:51,475 --> 00:39:57,436
Scott: I see look in text and they're like do this now set this at exactly 53 and set this Like, all right.

632
00:39:57,496 --> 00:40:01,170
Scott: I made icy looking text, but I didn't learn how to use any of those things that you just did.

633
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:02,434
Scott: Like how did you come up with that?

634
00:40:02,495 --> 00:40:02,635
Scott: Right?

635
00:40:02,715 --> 00:40:08,597
Scott: Well, how did you and I can't it's hard to find something that teaches me How to understand.

636
00:40:08,718 --> 00:40:11,007
Scott: actually, you know what how to work the thing, right?

637
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:17,005
Scott: so that I can not just follow these set steps and I feel like a lot of people.

638
00:40:17,025 --> 00:40:18,209
Scott: I try to teach people.

639
00:40:18,229 --> 00:40:22,410
Scott: when I try To teach someone something I want to teach them the way I want to be taught.

640
00:40:22,515 --> 00:40:22,910
Scott: All right Is.

641
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:28,550
Scott: I want them to understand the fundamental concept that you can then once you learn that you can do anything.

642
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:30,758
Scott: But people always want to learn from me.

643
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:34,330
Scott: do a do B do C and they don't even want to know what's happening.

644
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,137
Scott: They just want to remember a set of steps.

645
00:40:36,198 --> 00:40:37,523
Scott: type this exact string in.

646
00:40:37,784 --> 00:40:40,456
Scott: don't care what the string means Don't want to learn that.

647
00:40:40,757 --> 00:40:42,928
Scott: just want to know exactly what things to type in.

648
00:40:42,988 --> 00:40:46,771
Scott: and I'm like I don't want to tell you the exact thing to type in because I know that you're not learning anything Right.

649
00:40:47,414 --> 00:40:50,549
Scott: I want you to be able to understand how it works to be able to come up with.

650
00:40:50,669 --> 00:40:51,192
Rym: well Here's the thing.

651
00:40:51,232 --> 00:40:52,357
Scott: type in on your own.

652
00:40:52,437 --> 00:40:54,045
Rym: There are definitely places for both.

653
00:40:54,065 --> 00:40:55,190
Scott: people don't want to learn that.

654
00:40:55,411 --> 00:41:03,033
Rym: I mean there are times when like I'm in the middle of a project like I'm trying to get some guys video up or something or I'm trying to get like a server to work and I just got To get the thing done.

655
00:41:03,996 --> 00:41:07,690
Rym: and there's other times where I want to add a life skill to my toolkit.

656
00:41:08,411 --> 00:41:10,458
Rym: So that's why I know there's shit out of Premiere.

657
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,450
Scott: I only want to ever add a life skill because then I can get things done.

658
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,057
Rym: Yeah, but there's stuff I don't care about.

659
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:20,199
Rym: like I don't really want to learn how to do color grading I just don't care that much.

660
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:24,112
Rym: but like the same thing you said if Premiere I don't learn it I don't do it.

661
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:24,433
Scott: if you're

662
00:41:24,453 --> 00:41:46,850
Rym: trying to like edit some complex video and you like you can find a tutorial on Here is how to do multi-cam But that tutorial assumes that you have already got the rest of your production pipeline sorted out Mm-hmm, and if you just follow that tutorial you're gonna do something really really really Complicated and it's gonna really slow you down and you're frustrated and then you're probably ruin your project.

663
00:41:47,051 --> 00:41:55,197
Scott: The point is the kind of learning I like right where I learn how a thing really works is best is still to today Best found in books.

664
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,350
Scott: so pirate them or get the e-book version.

665
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:01,870
Scott: Yeah, you don't want a big stack of paper lying around your house that you then need to get rid of a loot crate.

666
00:42:02,071 --> 00:42:03,098
Rym: Yeah, be a pick and choose like.

667
00:42:03,139 --> 00:42:04,629
Rym: pick the things that you want to be.

668
00:42:05,173 --> 00:42:06,949
Rym: You don't want to just be like good at them.

669
00:42:07,331 --> 00:42:11,371
Rym: You want to be good enough at them to where you could teach someone else that you could explain what you do It.

670
00:42:11,391 --> 00:42:12,033
Scott: yeah, that's right.

671
00:42:12,434 --> 00:42:16,710
Scott: And but pick and choose like some things most good enough at it that you could write a book about it.

672
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:20,388
Rym: Yeah, but like Scott does not need to know the dinner workings of DHCP.

673
00:42:21,012 --> 00:42:23,163
Rym: He'll go to stack overflow and figure the shit out.

674
00:42:23,183 --> 00:42:23,867
Rym: I know another DHCP.

675
00:42:24,953 --> 00:42:28,170
Scott: I don't need to know how it works internally, but I understand exactly what it does.

676
00:42:28,451 --> 00:42:31,470
Scott: So what would you do if like I don't just know the steps to follow to go?

677
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,349
Rym: Do you make DHCP work if you have a switch?

678
00:42:35,153 --> 00:42:36,849
Scott: I mean just put a router next to the switch.

679
00:42:38,174 --> 00:42:41,275
Scott: Okay The router does the DHCP.

680
00:42:41,576 --> 00:42:44,264
Rym: DHCP requires some art broadcast stuff.

681
00:42:44,866 --> 00:42:46,330
Scott: I would just have a computer.

682
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:47,637
Scott: This is DHCP server.

683
00:42:47,657 --> 00:42:50,210
Rym: What if you want a DHCP server to work on two different networks?

684
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:56,550
Scott: I'd have to like bridge the networks together so that one network sends its DHCP broadcasting to the other.

685
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:57,977
Rym: You don't want to bridge the networks together.

686
00:42:57,997 --> 00:42:59,564
Rym: You want to use the DHCP relay?

687
00:42:59,846 --> 00:43:00,207
Scott: Okay.

688
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:00,730
Scott: I didn't know that.

689
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:01,234
Scott: That's the thing.

690
00:43:01,355 --> 00:43:06,200
Rym: Yeah, cuz you know what you're never gonna do the head Even do that you well all around.

691
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,870
Rym: but almost all good routers have to use to be really capability.

692
00:43:09,031 --> 00:43:22,272
Rym: I'm saying does anyone actually set those up like yeah, if you have one corporate DNS or a one corporate DHCP Across like your networks, but you have like a production network that's isolated from you know, that kind of stuff It's.

693
00:43:22,514 --> 00:43:24,870
Rym: but that's the kind of thing that you will never do in your daily life.

694
00:43:25,111 --> 00:43:30,489
Rym: So there's literally no point in you knowing how off hand or even learning the stupid details of why it's the way it is.

695
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,529
Scott: Anything else to say about books?

696
00:43:37,192 --> 00:43:41,260
Rym: This Has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

697
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:46,100
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

698

Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

703
00:44:07,141 --> 00:44:10,059
Scott: But unlike those other late shows it's actually recorded at night.

704
00:44:22,491 --> 00:44:34,609
Rym: And the patrons for this episode of GeekNights in order the amount of money they give us on a continuing basis as long as that amount of money is at least $5 are Alan Joyce Rebecca Dunn Nicholas Brando Heidi McNichol Amanda Duchette James David White Christian coops construction noises.

705
00:44:34,649 --> 00:44:46,755
Rym: my stated I'm Sean Hayworth William isomers Jeremy minor Chris Reimer and Thomas on Rochelle Montanona superboy the rainbow in the dark and Cerise Brian Fisher sailor visitor jail fried pork Iggy Smith Matthews Matthew Smith Don't like shark television.

709
00:44:59,793 --> 00:45:05,530
Rym: so you might have noticed that we stream this episode live just because fuck it might as well start doing stuff like that.

710
00:45:05,935 --> 00:45:10,268
Rym: This is the kind of stuff I said we're gonna try to do more and more now that we're back and we don't have anything going on.

711
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:28,922
Rym: however I might be flying to stupid Chicago on Wednesday morning and flying back Thursday morning meaning Probably won't be a Wednesday show this week, so not quite regular schedule yet, and then starting in mid-october I'm gonna be in Australia with Emily for two weeks But we're gonna get as much content out as we can in between all this travel.

712
00:45:29,483 --> 00:45:31,770
Rym: and now I leave you with something weird.

713
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:32,496
Rym: I'm just lost.

714
00:45:32,738 --> 00:45:34,169
Rym: see what we're trying to get to.

715

716
00:45:37,391 --> 00:45:38,294
Rym: Okay good to know.

717
00:45:38,555 --> 00:45:41,023
Rym: well, so you see I'm the highwayman.

718
00:45:41,043 --> 00:45:45,676
Rym: I make ends meet Just like any man.

719
00:45:46,398 --> 00:45:47,702
