1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,287
Rym: It's Thursday, April 30th.

2
00:00:11,488 --> 00:00:11,890
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:12,593
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:14,880
Rym: Chrysler's bankrupt and this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,442
Rym: Tonight we talk about how to not suck at eating out.

6
00:00:25,867 --> 00:00:26,947
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:31,631
Rym: We're back.

8
00:00:32,052 --> 00:00:32,534
Scott: Oh no.

9
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:50,504
Scott: Evan, I sort of, you know, this isn't like big news or anything, but I sort of gave up on, suffice to say, not because there's anything wrong with it on the, from the user perspective, but because I'm certain administrating the behind the scenes of it, it's basically poop right now.

10
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:51,449
Scott: It's super poop.

11
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:52,212
Scott: It's terrible.

12
00:00:52,272 --> 00:00:53,477
Scott: Laconica is not so good.

13
00:00:53,597 --> 00:00:57,373
Rym: It has a very high total cost of ownership, I would say that.

14
00:00:57,433 --> 00:00:57,755
Rym: Yes.

15
00:00:57,776 --> 00:01:01,436
Rym: Because I mean, I kind of poked at it every now and then and I can see

16
00:01:01,516 --> 00:01:14,665
Scott: like they have, they have an admirable goal of making it as easy to use and set up as WordPress, which is, you know, they, they're on the right track, you know, they want it to be that they know what's right, but it's not going, it's not actually going in that direction right now.

17
00:01:14,705 --> 00:01:15,772
Scott: It's a huge pain in the ass.

18
00:01:15,832 --> 00:01:16,314
Scott: It sucks.

19
00:01:16,455 --> 00:01:17,058
Rym: See, now here's the thing.

20
00:01:17,098 --> 00:01:26,365
Rym: It would have been okay if it had at least properly integrated with all the Twitter stuff, but it did kind of, kind of, but a lot of the applications didn't work with it.

21
00:01:26,546 --> 00:01:26,787
Rym: Yeah.

22
00:01:26,807 --> 00:01:27,692
Rym: A lot of embedded.

23
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:36,072
Scott: I think that's actually, that's actually more a problem of the Twitter clients, not, you know, because, uh, Laconic has the same exact API as Twitter.

24
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:39,493
Scott: It's like any Twitter app should actually be able to work with Laconic.

25
00:01:39,574 --> 00:01:47,446
Scott: All you have to do is be able to change the URL, but what I was saying is that the change, the URL feature, that's what I was saying, that almost every app just hard codes, Twitter, and you're fucked.

26
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:47,748
Rym: Yep.

27
00:01:47,788 --> 00:01:55,588
Scott: They hard like tweet deck could work perfectly with Laconica, except you can't change the URL from twitter.com to like, you know, whatever your Laconica is.

28
00:01:55,648 --> 00:02:02,886
Scott: So anyway, it was, well, I guess a lot of it's open source, so you could, you could, but anyway, it's a huge pain in the ass, right?

29
00:02:02,986 --> 00:02:03,630
Scott: To run this thing.

30
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,933
Rym: We should have just taken every open source Twitter app and just forked it to Laconica.

31
00:02:08,656 --> 00:02:12,794
Scott: Anyway, uh, the thing is you need to change the URL to the specific Laconica server.

32
00:02:12,814 --> 00:02:15,945
Rym: I fork it to where there's a text box.

33
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:16,889
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

34
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:20,286
Scott: Um, but anyway, it's a huge pain in the ass, but people like it.

35
00:02:20,326 --> 00:02:22,960
Scott: People were using it and I sort of feel bad shutting them off.

36
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,281
Scott: Right.

37
00:02:23,723 --> 00:02:25,652
Scott: So I'm just gonna let it sit there.

38
00:02:25,692 --> 00:02:30,395
Scott: I'm not touching it ever unless, you know, if it breaks, it's going to stay broken.

39
00:02:30,435 --> 00:02:31,259
Scott: I'm not going to fix it.

40
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,535
Scott: If it continues to work, I'm going to let it continue to work.

41
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,825
Rym: A spam farm.

42
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:37,728
Rym: It'll disappear.

43
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:38,331
Scott: Well, that's true.

44
00:02:38,552 --> 00:02:44,876
Scott: Um, uh, but you know, maybe someday, you know, like maybe Laconica 1.0 will be very nice.

45
00:02:44,896 --> 00:02:47,406
Scott: And in that case I will upgrade to.

46
00:02:47,446 --> 00:02:53,258
Rym: at this point, I really predict that Twitter just one and Twitter is going to be there until something else completely takes it over.

47
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:53,560
Rym: Yeah.

48
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:56,315
Scott: Uh, so I just sort of stopped using it really.

49
00:02:56,335 --> 00:03:00,921
Scott: And I'm just using Twitter and it's, it's way better because everyone else is actually using it.

50
00:03:01,242 --> 00:03:02,489
Rym: Yeah, I'm, I'm switching.

51
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:07,844
Rym: I have a Twitter account that the only thing in there was stuff automatically sent from Laconica and that stopped working at some point.

52
00:03:07,985 --> 00:03:11,790
Scott: I started, you know, and the thing is, you know, I read an article today that was totally true.

53
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:13,421
Scott: It's one of those things like, duh.

54
00:03:13,502 --> 00:03:17,869
Scott: You know, I remember the article that said, uh, every people, everyone installs iPhone apps, doesn't use them.

55
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,511
Scott: Right.

56
00:03:18,812 --> 00:03:25,871
Scott: This article was like, most people who joined Twitter stop using it after like 30 days or bear or just they join, but they don't actually use it.

57
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:26,596
Rym: Well, think about it.

58
00:03:26,636 --> 00:03:31,525
Rym: I mean, you hear about it in the news, especially now where all the mainstream media, like in Costa Rica, right?

59
00:03:31,867 --> 00:03:38,211
Rym: We sat down and tried to watch some Spanish news and then we'd watched some CNN and all this stuff one night, you know, just to see what was going on in the world.

60
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:40,926
Rym: And every news was talking about Twitter.

61
00:03:40,986 --> 00:03:44,344
Scott: Every news is talking about Twitter, all the newscaster sharing their Twitters.

62
00:03:44,705 --> 00:03:54,432
Scott: You know, I even saw when I was in Florida on the TV, uh, I think CNN was using Skype to bring someone in for a video interview and there was a Skype logo on the screen.

63
00:03:54,452 --> 00:03:55,759
Scott: So it's like, really?

64
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,853
Scott: It's like, Whoa, the TV news is doing the same shit.

65
00:03:58,994 --> 00:03:59,315
Scott: I do.

66
00:03:59,335 --> 00:03:59,396
Scott: Why?

67
00:03:59,898 --> 00:04:01,285
Scott: Why are they on TV?

68
00:04:01,426 --> 00:04:02,169
Scott: I should be on TV.

69
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,697
Scott: I'm doing the same exact thing as they are.

70
00:04:03,717 --> 00:04:14,995
Rym: Um, no, but you know, and then just, well, plus, I mean, Twitter is not that useful unless you're one of the people who is either going to use it for what it's good at or come up with a new way to use it.

71
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:20,706
Rym: Most people will use it for the novelty and they'll basically just be doing what that video did.

72
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:39,580
Scott: It's sort of the same problem that I had when I would, you know, with Facebook and things is that if you just log into it, right, if you make an account, if you don't actually use it, like you have to actually put in some effort, you have to go out and follow some people or friends, some people, and you have to, you know, type in some stuff.

73
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,993
Scott: You actually have to put some work into it to sort of, you know, crank them, you know, the flywheel and get it going.

74
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:53,558
Scott: And if you don't do that, you're just like, and you just look at it and try to figure it out, but you don't actually put in the work, you know, to get it going.

75
00:04:54,202 --> 00:04:57,544
Scott: You're just going to go, what the fuck is this and stop and not even and just ignore it.

76
00:04:57,564 --> 00:05:07,083
Rym: Well, I think a lot of people just don't have, you know, someone who's not super into the Internet and technology doesn't give you instant gratification is going to hear about it, think it's cool, think it's like Facebook.

77
00:05:07,123 --> 00:05:10,507
Rym: They'll get on it and they'll start typing into it and I'll just type stuff for a while.

78
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:14,833
Rym: But they probably won't figure out to follow anyone or even have anyone to follow.

79
00:05:14,853 --> 00:05:15,559
Rym: And then they'll give up.

80
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:17,614
Scott: I mean, Twitter sort of is helping itself now.

81
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:29,258
Scott: It's like when you when you make an account, it's sort of like tells you some interesting people to follow and sort of helps you automatically follow some famous people and stuff like that, you know, but whatever.

82
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:29,861
Scott: So.

83
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:30,262
Scott: But yeah.

84
00:05:30,343 --> 00:05:39,024
Scott: Anyway, I was on the tweets and somebody I've messaged, you know, what, you know, show schedules you return to will probably do a Thursday tomorrow.

85
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:41,557
Scott: And people are real excited about a Thursday tomorrow.

86
00:05:41,618 --> 00:05:42,924
Scott: So here it is.

87
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:48,432
Rym: So tomorrow became today and exactly didn't know what to do the show on until five minutes ago.

88
00:05:48,452 --> 00:05:49,376
Rym: That's fine.

89
00:05:49,477 --> 00:05:52,794
Rym: In fact, until about five minutes and twenty six seconds ago.

90
00:05:52,814 --> 00:05:53,397
Scott: That's all right.

91
00:05:53,578 --> 00:05:53,839
Scott: Yeah.

92
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:56,052
Rym: But we're not talking about Twitter.

93
00:05:56,072 --> 00:05:56,777
Rym: Don't worry.

94
00:05:57,179 --> 00:06:02,528
Scott: And, you know, we've been away from the show for a while, so we've built up quite a queue of things to discuss.

95
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:02,910
Rym: Yes.

96
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:07,453
Scott: And we want hope that we'll refrain from draining the queue in one episode.

97
00:06:07,755 --> 00:06:12,257
Rym: I will point out for the uninitiated that Scott was in Florida for much of last week.

98
00:06:12,297 --> 00:06:12,779
Scott: Well, we've got.

99
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:13,904
Scott: we got me in Florida.

100
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:19,170
Rym: Emily and I were in Costa Rica spending a couple of days in the Ocata resort.

101
00:06:19,471 --> 00:06:24,832
Rym: And also the rest of our time in the cloud forest at the Continental Divide.

102
00:06:25,153 --> 00:06:27,181
Scott: And also I was a job getting.

103
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:29,068
Scott: So there is a lot going on.

104
00:06:30,832 --> 00:06:33,270
Scott: Anyway, you want to you want to go on to like news thing today?

105
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:33,813
Scott: What I guess.

106
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:37,781
Rym: But at least I can for a lot of people who I know are waiting for the show on Costa Rica.

107
00:06:38,204 --> 00:06:41,484
Rym: Emily and I are going to record that probably this weekend, maybe Monday.

108
00:06:41,504 --> 00:06:42,390
Rym: You'll get it at some point.

109
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:47,195
Rym: I also have I took like five hundred pictures, maybe a quarter of them are worth looking at.

110
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:48,160
Scott: Yeah.

111
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:51,703
Scott: You know, just dump them on the flicker and then delete the ones that I learned.

112
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:52,730
Rym: I can say one thing.

113
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,098
Rym: I learned a lot about S.L.R.

114
00:06:54,118 --> 00:06:54,580
Rym: cameras.

115
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:55,204
Rym: Uh huh.

116
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:55,687
Rym: Yeah.

117
00:06:55,968 --> 00:06:56,270
Rym: All right.

118
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,155
Rym: I kind of like S.L.R.

119
00:06:57,175 --> 00:06:57,598
Rym: cameras.

120
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,040
Scott: Yeah.

121
00:06:58,362 --> 00:06:59,047
Scott: I'd like it, too.

122
00:06:59,127 --> 00:06:59,933
Scott: But it's sort of like Twitter.

123
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:00,981
Scott: You got to put some effort into it.

124
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:01,424
Scott: Yeah.

125
00:07:01,646 --> 00:07:02,109
Scott: Anything else?

126
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:10,996
Rym: Thing is, you'd be amazed how quickly like how much you can learn from reading five minutes of a fact that says this is what this does and this is what I mean.

127
00:07:11,036 --> 00:07:17,327
Scott: You know, my I'm still like trying to get more out of my digital camera because I've seen some my regular non S.L.R.

128
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:21,713
Scott: digital camera because I see other people like take amazing pictures of these freaking cameras.

129
00:07:22,116 --> 00:07:23,686
Scott: You know, it's like the point and shoot things.

130
00:07:23,746 --> 00:07:24,794
Scott: It's like I have one of those.

131
00:07:24,814 --> 00:07:25,942
Scott: I have a pretty good one of those.

132
00:07:26,224 --> 00:07:27,573
Scott: Why doesn't my picture look like that?

133
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:30,249
Scott: So I've been playing around with it a lot more.

134
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:32,143
Scott: And I think I've been taking better pictures with it.

135
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:37,978
Rym: Well, you know, I was looking at the kinds of pictures people take with my camera and I'm pretty much doing the best I can do.

136
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,985
Scott: Yeah, that's good.

137
00:07:39,427 --> 00:07:40,392
Rym: With my two megapixels.

138
00:07:40,673 --> 00:07:41,457
Scott: Yeah.

139
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:42,863
Scott: Time to move up to make.

140
00:07:42,903 --> 00:07:45,597
Scott: I mean, the iPhone, I think it almost has two megapixels.

141
00:07:45,637 --> 00:07:46,281
Scott: I don't even know.

142
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:52,438
Rym: Remember, we're at the point where megapixels matter a lot less than what kind of stuff is on the back end and the lenses.

143
00:07:53,162 --> 00:07:53,665
Scott: The iPhones.

144
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:55,314
Scott: major problem is it doesn't have autofocus.

145
00:07:55,515 --> 00:07:55,635
Rym: Yeah.

146
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:57,524
Rym: Well, it also doesn't really have lenses.

147
00:07:58,569 --> 00:07:59,916
Scott: You can go and get lenses for it.

148
00:08:00,137 --> 00:08:00,519
Rym: Yeah.

149
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,168
Rym: I've seen pictures of those and those.

150
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,417
Rym: just that that's a side talking right.

151
00:08:04,457 --> 00:08:06,023
Scott: there is a side talking.

152
00:08:06,585 --> 00:08:09,238
Rym: So news that isn't the bird flu.

153
00:08:09,278 --> 00:08:11,230
Rym: We're going to talk about that on Monday, probably.

154
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:11,631
Scott: All right.

155
00:08:11,651 --> 00:08:13,882
Scott: Well, this is a this is sort of a Monday news.

156
00:08:13,902 --> 00:08:17,659
Scott: So it but it's not bird flu or swine flu or so.

157
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:19,104
Scott: We have.

158
00:08:19,185 --> 00:08:21,975
Scott: we have our Internet service from Cablevision.

159
00:08:22,096 --> 00:08:22,377
Scott: Right.

160
00:08:22,437 --> 00:08:27,436
Scott: And they give you optimum voice, optimum TV and optimum.

161
00:08:27,456 --> 00:08:28,502
Rym: You got to pay for it.

162
00:08:28,622 --> 00:08:28,843
Scott: Right.

163
00:08:28,903 --> 00:08:29,084
Scott: Yeah.

164
00:08:29,506 --> 00:08:30,411
Scott: But, you know, it's the way.

165
00:08:30,451 --> 00:08:32,162
Scott: their plan is a pretty simple plan.

166
00:08:32,222 --> 00:08:32,403
Scott: Right.

167
00:08:32,443 --> 00:08:37,953
Scott: Is that if you get all three services, the triple play, they're 30 bucks each for a total of ninety dollars.

168
00:08:38,014 --> 00:08:38,215
Scott: Right.

169
00:08:38,778 --> 00:08:41,130
Scott: If you get just one service, it's fifty dollars.

170
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,437
Scott: So the Internet is fifty dollars.

171
00:08:42,496 --> 00:08:43,724
Scott: The voice is fifty dollars.

172
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,474
Scott: The TV is fifty dollars.

173
00:08:45,555 --> 00:08:48,975
Scott: But then, you know, you got HBO's and all sorts of packages going on there.

174
00:08:49,016 --> 00:08:49,840
Scott: But that's typical.

175
00:08:50,784 --> 00:08:51,629
Scott: They're coming out.

176
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:55,250
Scott: They're rolling it out real soon, like next month ish in certain places.

177
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,963
Scott: Optimum ultra, you know, an awesome ultra is.

178
00:09:00,345 --> 00:09:03,205
Rym: Well, I do because you already told me I already read about it, but you can.

179
00:09:03,225 --> 00:09:07,527
Scott: you can break the for ninety nine ninety nine, which is one hundred dollars.

180
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,050
Rym: Ninety nine.

181
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,833
Rym: Ninety nine.

182
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,269
Scott: They will give you also online Internet connection.

183
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:13,093
Rym: What is this, an ad?

184
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:13,534
Scott: Right.

185
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:15,423
Scott: I don't know what the upload speed is.

186
00:09:15,443 --> 00:09:20,823
Scott: The download speed is one hundred and one megabits per second.

187
00:09:21,064 --> 00:09:27,633
Rym: Now, there are many questions about this, as in what what can we expect from the upstream providers?

188
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:28,095
Rym: Yeah.

189
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:28,558
Scott: Yeah.

190
00:09:28,678 --> 00:09:30,969
Scott: But I'm sure I mean, our upstream is like two.

191
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:31,913
Scott: Right.

192
00:09:32,173 --> 00:09:34,460
Scott: So and our downstream is over 10.

193
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:34,701
Scott: It's like 14.

194
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:39,561
Scott: So I mean, the upstream of about 10 will keep it to the same.

195
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:40,446
Rym: Here's the question.

196
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,777
Rym: Is this always going to be unmetered?

197
00:09:42,797 --> 00:09:42,878
Rym: Yeah.

198
00:09:44,023 --> 00:09:48,728
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, Cable Vision is actually one of the better Internet providers.

199
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:49,231
Scott: You know, they don't.

200
00:09:49,593 --> 00:09:53,979
Scott: I've never gotten a complaint about bit torrenting or Pirate Bay or or anything like that.

201
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:54,844
Scott: They're just totally cool.

202
00:09:54,864 --> 00:09:56,755
Rym: The thing that it's so totally.

203
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:59,897
Scott: they're not so good with the cable and some other things, but we don't care about that.

204
00:09:59,937 --> 00:10:00,320
Rym: Yeah.

205
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,106
Rym: But here's the problem.

206
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:05,315
Scott: As an Internet service provider, Cable Vision is pretty awesome with our current with our current service.

207
00:10:05,616 --> 00:10:07,205
Rym: It's already faster than we need.

208
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:09,924
Rym: I know because they won't let us host on that ultra whatever.

209
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:14,147
Rym: There's no way you can get the business class, but that's too expensive and not fast enough.

210
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,519
Scott: Well, you can get the business class with the ultra.

211
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:19,272
Rym: Even so, it's not going to be enough.

212
00:10:19,332 --> 00:10:19,573
Scott: Yeah.

213
00:10:19,975 --> 00:10:23,270
Scott: The thing is, I mean, one hundred and one is so fast.

214
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,139
Scott: First of all, you pretty much need gigabit.

215
00:10:25,702 --> 00:10:32,799
Scott: If you actually are getting one hundred from the outside for the outside, you need a gigabit inside or else it's just not going to happen.

216
00:10:33,744 --> 00:10:36,197
Rym: Well, now, because if you're fully switched, it won't really matter.

217
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,719
Rym: Well, remember, there's no collisions on a fully switched FTX.

218
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:44,706
Scott: No, no, but one hundred and one megabits per second is greater than so one hundred network.

219
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:46,955
Rym: You're going to lose that one megabit per second.

220
00:10:47,035 --> 00:10:47,417
Scott: Yes.

221
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,484
Scott: Oh, no.

222
00:10:49,564 --> 00:10:51,432
Scott: I'm paying ninety nine dollars a month.

223
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:52,779
Scott: That's twelve hundred a year.

224
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,308
Scott: I want that one megabit.

225
00:10:54,328 --> 00:10:55,415
Rym: You're not going to be able to use it.

226
00:10:55,576 --> 00:11:04,980
Rym: And if you have a good switch and you have two computers connecting and you set it up right, you can still use that hundred and one with a hundred based network.

227
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:05,543
Scott: Oh, man.

228
00:11:06,106 --> 00:11:07,976
Scott: But yet it's still that stupid fast.

229
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:13,138
Scott: Think about how fast you could download like a movie, like a full HD movie, like.

230
00:11:14,503 --> 00:11:17,334
Scott: Pretty well, I mean, seriously, it's ludicrous speed.

231
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:25,953
Rym: All right, so but what about all these articles about how the Internet's going to slow down and stop and we're running out of bandwidth and everyone's going to have to meet her and it's too expensive.

232
00:11:26,174 --> 00:11:30,677
Scott: Cablevision apparently disagrees with, you know, Comcast and Time Warner and everyone else.

233
00:11:30,878 --> 00:11:31,300
Scott: I don't know.

234
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,004
Rym: I'm leery.

235
00:11:32,285 --> 00:11:32,506
Rym: Yeah.

236
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:34,496
Scott: And Fios also seems to disagree.

237
00:11:34,556 --> 00:11:38,153
Scott: It's like Verizon and Cablevision are like on one side.

238
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:40,385
Rym: like Fios, though, has a lot of problems.

239
00:11:40,425 --> 00:11:40,827
Scott: It does.

240
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:43,179
Scott: But its problems are not bandwidth and speed.

241
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:44,103
Scott: Its problems are else.

242
00:11:44,605 --> 00:11:44,806
Rym: Yeah.

243
00:11:44,847 --> 00:11:45,993
Rym: But see the else.

244
00:11:46,054 --> 00:11:51,170
Rym: when it comes to the fact that my co-workers come in every day and they're like, yeah, my files was down for like four hours last night.

245
00:11:51,471 --> 00:11:53,803
Scott: Well, you know, you got to pay for business if you want reliability.

246
00:11:53,823 --> 00:11:53,864
Scott: No.

247
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,423
Scott: But, you know, the problems are not bandwidth.

248
00:11:57,464 --> 00:11:57,645
Scott: Right.

249
00:11:57,665 --> 00:12:01,665
Scott: So on the bandwidth issue alone, you have Fios and Cablevision and then everyone else.

250
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,375
Scott: So I think that's interesting.

251
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,444
Rym: I think there's much more important news than the fact that you can get more Internet than you need.

252
00:12:07,464 --> 00:12:09,658
Scott: One hundred and one megabits per second.

253
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:11,728
Scott: I need that for what I would pay for.

254
00:12:11,748 --> 00:12:12,753
Rym: What would you use it for?

255
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:19,021
Scott: Oh, that would have been toward going all day getting what I would go buy like a NAS and load it up.

256
00:12:19,162 --> 00:12:19,885
Rym: What would you get?

257
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,976
Rym: You know, there's a lot of stuff out there.

258
00:12:21,996 --> 00:12:23,508
Scott: Every thing ever.

259
00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:26,737
Rym: You don't like things.

260
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:27,943
Scott: Just because I can.

261
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:30,056
Rym: Scott, you used to hate the fanboys who did that.

262
00:12:30,076 --> 00:12:35,586
Rym: Remember the guys at RIT who would go on the direct connect and download like four terabytes.

263
00:12:35,706 --> 00:12:36,952
Scott: They were on a meager O.C.

264
00:12:37,012 --> 00:12:37,354
Scott: three.

265
00:12:37,374 --> 00:12:39,685
Scott: This is a is one hundred and one megabit.

266
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,132
Rym: They were on two O.C.

267
00:12:41,172 --> 00:12:42,558
Rym: threes and a T3.

268
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:44,145
Scott: How is an O.C.

269
00:12:44,165 --> 00:12:44,346
Scott: three?

270
00:12:44,366 --> 00:12:45,773
Scott: One hundred and one megabits per second.

271
00:12:46,396 --> 00:12:46,758
Rym: An O.C.

272
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:47,642
Rym: three is a lot.

273
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:48,226
Scott: Yeah.

274
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:48,969
Scott: But I don't know how much.

275
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,157
Scott: I don't think I don't know.

276
00:12:50,197 --> 00:12:53,396
Rym: Remember, it was Internet, too, which actually means a lot more.

277
00:12:53,437 --> 00:12:58,162
Scott: That does mean I would pay one hundred dollars a month to get an Internet to even without Internet one.

278
00:12:58,182 --> 00:13:03,932
Rym: I can't express to you how much I would pay to have the legal right to use Internet to from my home.

279
00:13:04,193 --> 00:13:04,435
Scott: Oh, yeah.

280
00:13:04,475 --> 00:13:05,885
Rym: Without having to go back to school.

281
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:07,093
Scott: I mean, and then have to pay.

282
00:13:07,113 --> 00:13:13,614
Scott: You know, I had to buy like a Cisco router that would, you know, automatically route the Internet, two packets over one wire and the Internet one packets of the.

283
00:13:13,635 --> 00:13:14,097
Rym: You know what?

284
00:13:14,138 --> 00:13:16,653
Scott: If I ever get rich and then IPv6, I would pay so much.

285
00:13:17,015 --> 00:13:26,859
Rym: If I ever get rich enough, I'll just pay to be a student again, be a student forever and just have my my connection to Internet, too, from my apartment on campus somewhere.

286
00:13:27,602 --> 00:13:27,924
Scott: I don't know.

287
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:29,310
Scott: I would pay to be.

288
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,689
Scott: I know if I was rich enough, I would make a school.

289
00:13:33,852 --> 00:13:34,093
Scott: Right.

290
00:13:34,254 --> 00:13:36,607
Rym: Well, it's got school for the four gifted students.

291
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:37,050
Rym: Yes.

292
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,920
Rym: So Chrysler actually filed for bankruptcy.

293
00:13:41,161 --> 00:13:41,884
Scott: Oh, no.

294
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:44,634
Rym: And I guess everyone saw this coming.

295
00:13:44,674 --> 00:13:54,285
Rym: But I think I don't think I need to say they're going to be a lot of ramifications to this, not just in the business world, but mostly just any kind of public perception ripple.

296
00:13:54,305 --> 00:14:00,590
Scott: Well, I think it's sort of a good thing, actually, in that if you look at history, right, at least the history of the United States, there have been a lot of brands.

297
00:14:00,771 --> 00:14:01,012
Scott: Right.

298
00:14:01,434 --> 00:14:04,150
Scott: And there are a lot of brands that were old and don't exist anymore.

299
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:09,977
Scott: I mean, you know, there was like they used to be cars from brands like Tucker or Studebaker.

300
00:14:10,018 --> 00:14:10,479
Scott: Right.

301
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,841
Scott: And, you know, we used to have like, you know, I don't know, lots of stuff doesn't exist.

302
00:14:15,862 --> 00:14:16,083
Scott: I don't.

303
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:17,190
Scott: Does RCA still exist?

304
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:17,952
Scott: Yes.

305
00:14:18,334 --> 00:14:18,757
Scott: Really?

306
00:14:18,797 --> 00:14:19,139
Scott: Yes.

307
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:19,742
Scott: I don't know.

308
00:14:19,762 --> 00:14:20,345
Scott: But there's lots of.

309
00:14:20,385 --> 00:14:22,395
Scott: there's lots of brands that don't exist anymore.

310
00:14:22,837 --> 00:14:25,368
Scott: But for a while now, in recent history.

311
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:25,830
Scott: Right.

312
00:14:26,471 --> 00:14:28,180
Scott: Very few brands have died.

313
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,720
Scott: I think the last brand I can remember dying, at least major one, was like MCI.

314
00:14:32,002 --> 00:14:33,713
Scott: You know, can you remember one more reason than that?

315
00:14:33,813 --> 00:14:34,195
Scott: You know what?

316
00:14:34,255 --> 00:14:37,712
Rym: Actually, I still call MCI all the time.

317
00:14:38,013 --> 00:14:40,102
Rym: We have a lot of MCI circuits.

318
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:40,805
Scott: Really?

319
00:14:40,825 --> 00:14:40,905
Scott: Yeah.

320
00:14:40,925 --> 00:14:42,231
Scott: I thought they were dead.

321
00:14:42,271 --> 00:14:42,994
Rym: They are dead.

322
00:14:43,134 --> 00:14:43,576
Scott: OK.

323
00:14:43,978 --> 00:14:44,841
Scott: But yeah, it's like.

324
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:57,540
Scott: I think that we do need to have sort of a, you know, a reminder, you know, I think it would have a good psychological helping to society if we realize that, you know, these brands aren't like, you know, permanent.

325
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:02,265
Rym: But the brands basically are permanent because bankruptcy doesn't mean Chrysler disappears.

326
00:15:02,587 --> 00:15:05,889
Rym: Bankruptcy means Chrysler doesn't have to pay a lot of its debts and will reappear.

327
00:15:06,371 --> 00:15:06,693
Scott: I know.

328
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:07,095
Scott: I know.

329
00:15:07,175 --> 00:15:07,718
Scott: But it's still.

330
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,553
Scott: it's just to show that these things are vulnerable.

331
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:18,009
Scott: People think of these things as like, you know, like, like, like, like unmoving rocks, like, you know, things that are always there.

332
00:15:18,311 --> 00:15:25,654
Scott: You know, they don't even think about the moving to know that these things can move and change and aren't like, you know, 100 percent stable, I think is how we'll see.

333
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,728
Rym: No, I think we need a much more fundamental change.

334
00:15:27,869 --> 00:15:36,338
Rym: And my fear is that if only Chrysler goes down like this and Ford is probably going to pull through and, you know, all this stuff's going on, I feel like we're not going to change.

335
00:15:36,378 --> 00:15:50,110
Rym: the fundamental problem that why do we make an incrementally better car every year and then have this whole like there's such a drive to get people to constantly buy new cars when now my 98 Sunfire is going pretty strong?

336
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:57,756
Scott: You know, I mean, people are talking a lot about this is that there is sort of like these rules of society that and we sort of treat them like their laws of physics.

337
00:15:57,777 --> 00:16:01,478
Scott: We don't even think about changing them because they've become so ingrained.

338
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:12,626
Scott: But really, we can you know, there are things like you don't even question, like, why do you have, you know, like one model of every type of class of car for every brand?

339
00:16:12,987 --> 00:16:15,418
Scott: Why do you make a new model every single year?

340
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,790
Scott: Why, you know, why do you do it this way?

341
00:16:18,191 --> 00:16:19,218
Scott: You can do it differently.

342
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:21,492
Scott: There's no law saying you have to do it that way.

343
00:16:21,975 --> 00:16:23,263
Rym: You can do whatever the hell you want.

344
00:16:23,303 --> 00:16:24,793
Rym: I mean, we see this in everything.

345
00:16:24,813 --> 00:16:25,417
Rym: You're all geeks.

346
00:16:25,438 --> 00:16:26,364
Rym: Look at anime cons.

347
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:38,173
Rym: People start a new anime convention and they look at all the other conventions, say, well, I got to have a cosplay and I got to have some video rooms and I got to have the fan parodies and I got to have the cosplay ball and I got to have this and that.

348
00:16:38,615 --> 00:16:45,652
Rym: And people just it's very rare to see anything kind of break away from the mold if there is an established mold already in place.

349
00:16:46,034 --> 00:16:46,215
Scott: Yeah.

350
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:58,913
Scott: I mean, why can't you have, say, an anime convention that's outside and is just one big thing and there's only one event and there's one schedule and everyone does all these things together and that's it.

351
00:16:59,014 --> 00:17:02,998
Scott: And this food, you know, it could be like that's like nothing like anime conventions are now.

352
00:17:03,058 --> 00:17:06,454
Scott: But if it's about anime, why is it still an anime convention?

353
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:08,184
Scott: It's a gathering of anime folks.

354
00:17:08,204 --> 00:17:13,209
Rym: But everything in the car thing really bothers me just because a lot of cars like.

355
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,787
Rym: I look at them and I wonder who the hell's buying these cars.

356
00:17:15,928 --> 00:17:17,558
Rym: I guess the answer was no one.

357
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,866
Rym: And that's why Chrysler is going out.

358
00:17:18,925 --> 00:17:19,107
Scott: Yeah.

359
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,859
Scott: And the other thing is you look around.

360
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,102
Scott: Right.

361
00:17:21,162 --> 00:17:28,279
Scott: And there are certain car models that are bought in crazy numbers like Honda Civic Toyota, Corolla Mazda three.

362
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:30,028
Scott: Mazda three is not bought in that crazy.

363
00:17:30,108 --> 00:17:32,159
Rym: It's still bought a lot.

364
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,324
Scott: It's a very popular car.

365
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:34,390
Scott: Not as popular as the other two.

366
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:34,771
Scott: Right.

367
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:38,205
Scott: And there are other cars that are hardly bought.

368
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:44,149
Scott: You know, like you hardly ever see like, I don't know, Pontiac Solstice.

369
00:17:44,209 --> 00:17:44,389
Scott: Right.

370
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,234
Scott: When do you see one of those?

371
00:17:45,254 --> 00:17:48,755
Rym: You know what those guys like once a month, you got part of.

372
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:49,703
Rym: that is where we live.

373
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:50,388
Rym: Look at where we live.

374
00:17:50,408 --> 00:17:51,193
Rym: We live in New York.

375
00:17:51,395 --> 00:17:51,656
Rym: I know.

376
00:17:51,777 --> 00:17:52,099
Rym: I know.

377
00:17:52,461 --> 00:17:54,954
Rym: Go to the Midwest and you see a total like when I was in high school.

378
00:17:54,995 --> 00:17:55,196
Rym: Right.

379
00:17:55,678 --> 00:18:00,421
Rym: I drove a laser and the popular car in the area was a duster, a duster.

380
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,168
Rym: Everyone had a duster.

381
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,213
Scott: What's a duster?

382
00:18:03,394 --> 00:18:04,158
Rym: Pretty crappy car.

383
00:18:04,178 --> 00:18:04,983
Scott: I never even heard of one.

384
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:08,480
Rym: Anyway, I had my laser and a lot of people had lasers.

385
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:13,425
Rym: And when I left Michigan, I've seen like two lasers ever since I left Michigan.

386
00:18:13,646 --> 00:18:14,792
Scott: It's like, you look at Ford, right?

387
00:18:14,872 --> 00:18:22,719
Scott: Ford makes, let's see if I can name all their cars, but it's like, they've got, you know, a Mustang, they've got the focus, they've got, uh, the tourist equivalent.

388
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,006
Scott: I think they changed the name of it.

389
00:18:24,368 --> 00:18:26,439
Scott: They got like three or four different trucks.

390
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,887
Scott: They got vans, they got right.

391
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:29,918
Scott: Why do you, you know, I mean, sure.

392
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:37,713
Scott: Every one of those types of vehicles is needed by someone, but why does every single car brand have to have one car in every class?

393
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:39,462
Scott: I mean, is it really necessary?

394
00:18:39,804 --> 00:18:41,333
Rym: Well, even more, I noticed something.

395
00:18:41,474 --> 00:18:43,005
Scott: I guess Mazda sort of breaks the mold.

396
00:18:43,045 --> 00:18:44,272
Scott: They don't have any vans.

397
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:50,398
Scott: that, you know, I think they have like a, an SUV, a convertible, a normal car and a race car.

398
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:57,515
Rym: Well, one thing I noticed come kind of to the side, but it struck me suddenly that I was kind of thinking about buying a new car and I'm poking around.

399
00:18:57,535 --> 00:19:03,544
Rym: And when I was a kid, I knew every make and model of car and I knew who made what, like.

400
00:19:03,564 --> 00:19:05,938
Rym: I knew it all, like every single car that was a production.

401
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:09,376
Rym: I know a bunch, but I don't know all, but I used to know all.

402
00:19:09,536 --> 00:19:19,086
Rym: And I realized the reason I did is I watched TV and you know, I listened to the radio and everything and there's a lot of car advertising seems to be the primary advertising.

403
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:20,755
Rym: There are more car ads than everything else.

404
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:21,380
Scott: Absolutely.

405
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,863
Rym: And you'd always, you know, the Ford, like a rock, cars, soft drinks, banks.

406
00:19:27,064 --> 00:19:28,208
Scott: That's like the big ads.

407
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:31,002
Rym: They just like Ford focus just sounded right.

408
00:19:31,022 --> 00:19:35,705
Rym: But it only sounded right because I heard Ford focus in the background from these commercials forever.

409
00:19:36,488 --> 00:19:41,804
Rym: So now, you know, I haven't watched TV in like seven years really.

410
00:19:41,824 --> 00:19:45,276
Rym: And I don't use, yeah, yeah.

411
00:19:45,296 --> 00:19:53,870
Rym: From, from 2000, it has been nine years since I had cable TV or watched any appreciable amount of TV radio block ads on the internet.

412
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,978
Rym: So I like the solstice.

413
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,243
Rym: I didn't know it existed.

414
00:19:57,685 --> 00:20:00,197
Scott: I knew it existed only because I saw one on the street.

415
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,570
Rym: Well, I didn't really, I'd see cars.

416
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:03,614
Rym: I didn't exist anymore.

417
00:20:03,675 --> 00:20:08,218
Rym: Pontiac's gone, but I didn't know the Pontiac's gone, gone, or I'd see it.

418
00:20:08,238 --> 00:20:13,409
Rym: Saturn's probably, maybe I'd see something like a solstice, but unless I looked for the logo, I wouldn't know who made it.

419
00:20:13,691 --> 00:20:14,195
Rym: I didn't have that.

420
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:15,947
Scott: Whenever I see a car I've never seen before.

421
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:17,879
Scott: I always try to, I try to see what it is.

422
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:22,104
Rym: See, the other thing that helped was when I stopped driving and just started taking the train.

423
00:20:22,145 --> 00:20:23,613
Rym: every day, I stopped seeing cars.

424
00:20:23,653 --> 00:20:24,336
Scott: That's true too.

425
00:20:24,998 --> 00:20:32,178
Rym: But I wonder if, you know, we're, you know, the affluent 20 something demographic, the demographic that is the most sought after in the world.

426
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:42,827
Rym: And yet at the same time, the most difficult to advertise to, I think our demographic more and more is disconnected from advertising and isn't affected by car advertising as much.

427
00:20:43,449 --> 00:20:58,804
Rym: And as a result, probably at least in theory, spend a little bit more time researching because we don't know when we buy cars and we'll probably gravitate toward cars that our friends have bought or that I don't know, we found online on some blog or something.

428
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,715
Scott: Maybe like two of our friends bought Honda fits.

429
00:21:01,157 --> 00:21:02,927
Rym: You know, I didn't know the Honda fit existed.

430
00:21:03,047 --> 00:21:06,328
Scott: I knew it existed and I probably would have bought it if it was available.

431
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:11,355
Rym: You know, when I bought my car, which it wasn't, it wasn't out until he drove up with this car.

432
00:21:11,376 --> 00:21:12,684
Rym: And I'm like, what kind of car is this?

433
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,832
Rym: He's like a Honda fit.

434
00:21:13,892 --> 00:21:16,147
Rym: And I look online and it's a pretty damn good car.

435
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:16,610
Scott: It's pretty good.

436
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:17,151
Rym: Yeah.

437
00:21:17,893 --> 00:21:18,456
Rym: It's very nice.

438
00:21:18,717 --> 00:21:19,861
Rym: And Honda's doing okay.

439
00:21:20,283 --> 00:21:20,564
Rym: Yeah.

440
00:21:21,628 --> 00:21:28,922
Scott: But yeah, I think that, you know, why do we need, you know, I mean, I'm all for, you know, individuality, customization, right?

441
00:21:29,002 --> 00:21:30,067
Scott: Personalization all.

442
00:21:30,128 --> 00:21:35,752
Scott: I mean, I bought custom sunglasses, a custom messenger bag, you know, custom everything, right?

443
00:21:36,113 --> 00:21:46,704
Scott: But is it really necessary with something as big and as expensive as cars to have so many different ones, especially when many of them are so unpopular or so rarely used?

444
00:21:46,744 --> 00:21:50,062
Rym: Well, it doesn't help that cars themselves are not terribly customizable.

445
00:21:50,082 --> 00:21:50,625
Rym: Yeah.

446
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:51,712
Rym: Partly due to manufacturing.

447
00:21:51,732 --> 00:21:52,054
Rym: They are.

448
00:21:52,114 --> 00:21:55,432
Rym: If you're a ricer, I don't think that's not custom.

449
00:21:55,492 --> 00:21:56,577
Rym: That's something special.

450
00:21:56,597 --> 00:21:56,678
Rym: Yeah.

451
00:21:57,743 --> 00:22:03,497
Scott: Well, I mean, Sion tried to do that, you know, the shtick where they were trying to market their cars as being customizable to racers.

452
00:22:04,461 --> 00:22:04,661
Rym: Yeah.

453
00:22:04,702 --> 00:22:05,444
Rym: But how did that go?

454
00:22:06,528 --> 00:22:07,714
Scott: Some people are buying them.

455
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:08,156
Rym: Yeah.

456
00:22:08,738 --> 00:22:08,919
Rym: Yeah.

457
00:22:09,301 --> 00:22:14,933
Rym: I just, I, I kind of wonder what's going to happen to my home state of Michigan because things are not going well in Michigan.

458
00:22:15,395 --> 00:22:18,287
Scott: It's going to be an awesome airsoft paintball arena.

459
00:22:18,729 --> 00:22:28,689
Rym: No, because if you're in the dot and you're in downtown Detroit in like some factory, abandoned factory playing airsoft, God's hour, someone with a real gun is going to want to join in on the fun.

460
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,190
Scott: It's all right.

461
00:22:38,298 --> 00:22:40,220
Rym: But anyway, things of the day, let's get this going.

462
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:48,182
Rym: So I have a dream that the MLK estate is going to stop trying to sue people who do things with Martin Luther King's speeches and images.

463
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:52,639
Rym: And I'm pretty sure that this is fair use.

464
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:53,746
Rym: And if it isn't, it should be.

465
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:55,076
Rym: But I like this.

466
00:22:55,136 --> 00:22:55,982
Rym: So it's my thing of the day.

467
00:22:56,083 --> 00:23:10,679
Rym: It's a, there was this thing on college humor of charge Hill giving his speeches run through the Britney Spears filter, which is basically you can, it's pretty easy to take a mediocre singer and run pitch shift shifting to make them sound like a really good.

468
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:14,000
Scott: Well, don't you have to tell the shifter like what the song is to a degree?

469
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,189
Rym: I mean, there's different ways to do it.

470
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,683
Scott: It doesn't just work for any singing.

471
00:23:16,723 --> 00:23:18,599
Scott: You have to like, tell it like, you know, what the notes are.

472
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,585
Rym: Not necessarily.

473
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:21,137
Rym: I mean, it depends on what you're trying to do.

474
00:23:21,238 --> 00:23:24,320
Rym: One way to do it is to give it a key and all the key changes.

475
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:31,725
Rym: So what key it's in at a given time, and then you just sing as close as you can and it'll match you to what note you probably should be singing.

476
00:23:32,772 --> 00:23:34,000
Rym: And then there are all different ways to do it.

477
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,753
Rym: It's really complex, interesting, cool software.

478
00:23:35,773 --> 00:23:36,418
Rym: And you can do it live.

479
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,247
Rym: You can do it after the fact, but someone did a mediocre job with Churchill and it was pretty good.

480
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,069
Rym: Someone then did a pretty awesome job with Martin Luther King Jr's.

481
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,014
Rym: I have a dream speech.

482
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:54,434
Rym: They kind of made this techno E remix music video thing that honestly is kind of inspiring and is kind of touching to watch.

483
00:23:54,796 --> 00:23:55,520
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty good.

484
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:00,900
Rym: I highly recommend you watch it and maybe someday we'll talk more about that sort of software because I think it's neat.

485
00:24:01,181 --> 00:24:02,689
Scott: Or the Martin Luther King estate.

486
00:24:03,091 --> 00:24:03,392
Rym: Yeah.

487
00:24:03,795 --> 00:24:04,036
Rym: Yeah.

488
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:13,983
Rym: I've talked about them before, so I don't want to belabor the point, but when was the last time we had someone in the US who was as memorable and important as Martin Luther King

489
00:24:14,003 --> 00:24:14,345
Rym: Jr.?

490
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:15,772
Rym: Yeah.

491
00:24:15,993 --> 00:24:18,366
Scott: I mean, I started discussing this like a few minutes ago.

492
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:19,533
Scott: It sort of came to me, right?

493
00:24:19,553 --> 00:24:20,680
Scott: Like who today?

494
00:24:21,363 --> 00:24:29,074
Scott: Can you think of a single person alive today who you could conceive of ever having a federal holiday for them?

495
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:30,599
Rym: Wait, having or should have?

496
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,104
Scott: You know, should have.

497
00:24:32,124 --> 00:24:33,108
Rym: Uh, Dallaire.

498
00:24:33,912 --> 00:24:36,243
Scott: Well, I mean, a United States federal holiday.

499
00:24:36,263 --> 00:24:38,413
Rym: Uh, it still should be Dallaire.

500
00:24:39,638 --> 00:24:40,381
Scott: You know what I'm saying?

501
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:41,948
Scott: Like who alive?

502
00:24:42,028 --> 00:24:45,784
Scott: I mean, like even Obama, who is historically significant.

503
00:24:46,386 --> 00:24:48,798
Scott: Should there really be a Barack Obama day?

504
00:24:48,858 --> 00:24:49,320
Rym: We have to wait.

505
00:24:49,441 --> 00:24:50,989
Rym: He needs more time.

506
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:53,984
Rym: He hasn't, he's only, he's only been president like a hundred days.

507
00:24:54,004 --> 00:24:54,345
Rym: Yeah.

508
00:24:54,365 --> 00:24:57,017
Scott: But I mean, not really, probably not.

509
00:24:57,118 --> 00:24:57,359
Scott: Right.

510
00:24:57,439 --> 00:25:02,602
Scott: So, you know what, who, who alive then should ever have a federal holiday for them?

511
00:25:02,924 --> 00:25:03,930
Scott: There's no one like that.

512
00:25:04,051 --> 00:25:06,504
Scott: People like that I think are, don't exist anymore.

513
00:25:07,126 --> 00:25:14,988
Scott: And I think that's part of the, the reason why we can't, you know, make changes happen because you know, there's, we don't have those kinds of people around.

514
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:22,815
Rym: See, is it really a matter of not having these people or is it just a matter of expectations and perceptions changing coupled with the fact that media is more diffuse?

515
00:25:23,198 --> 00:25:28,503
Scott: Well, I think that, you know, it could be that those things are the cause of not having the people.

516
00:25:28,584 --> 00:25:31,743
Scott: And it's sort of a reciprocal situation, sort of catch 22, perhaps.

517
00:25:31,884 --> 00:25:32,105
Scott: Yeah.

518
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:32,769
Scott: Something like that.

519
00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:44,026
Scott: You know, it's like, I blame partly on the fact that if there was a big, united, strong movement of ideas and enough people agreeing on something awesome, then you know that that person just emerges.

520
00:25:44,267 --> 00:25:51,283
Scott: or, you know, is it that you need that person to make it emerge when it's, you know, where the, the movement is there, but hidden?

521
00:25:51,303 --> 00:26:05,311
Rym: I think part of it honestly, is that a lot of these old historical figures, we have the long great speech that they gave, especially in this era where there was video of this speech, but before we got into the TV, Twitter soundbite era.

522
00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:12,675
Rym: So you've got eloquent speakers writing literary, intelligent, engaging speeches.

523
00:26:12,796 --> 00:26:15,709
Rym: We had orators and there aren't that many orders anymore.

524
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:17,720
Rym: And well, no, no, I take that back.

525
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,776
Rym: There are orders, but people don't give a shit anymore.

526
00:26:20,856 --> 00:26:23,894
Scott: Well, if you, you go to Ted, that's, that's where I get my oration.

527
00:26:24,156 --> 00:26:24,357
Rym: Yeah.

528
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,186
Rym: But how popular is Ted?

529
00:26:26,407 --> 00:26:27,633
Scott: popular among smart people?

530
00:26:27,693 --> 00:26:27,974
Scott: Yeah.

531
00:26:28,014 --> 00:26:28,175
Rym: Yeah.

532
00:26:28,215 --> 00:26:28,517
Rym: Yeah.

533
00:26:28,898 --> 00:26:29,682
Rym: Watch that videos.

534
00:26:29,924 --> 00:26:30,427
Scott: I've been watched.

535
00:26:30,467 --> 00:26:31,231
Scott: I subscribe to.

536
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:32,720
Scott: Ted is a video podcast now.

537
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,072
Scott: So I'm just watching all of them on the iPhone or whatever.

538
00:26:35,092 --> 00:26:37,163
Scott: That's the way to go.

539
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:41,078
Rym: I'm seriously considering just paying and joining and going.

540
00:26:41,098 --> 00:26:42,987
Scott: It's like a bajillion dollars.

541
00:26:43,088 --> 00:26:46,446
Scott: I'm thinking about it's like a quarter of your monies a year.

542
00:26:46,506 --> 00:26:47,351
Rym: There are different levels.

543
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:50,871
Scott: You realize really isn't, but I've seen tickets go on eBay for like $25,000.

544
00:26:50,871 --> 00:26:53,930
Rym: Well, there are different levels of sponsorship.

545
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:56,808
Rym: Some of those levels do not involve going, at least not right away.

546
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,247
Scott: Well then why would I pay if I'm not going to get other stuff?

547
00:27:00,348 --> 00:27:01,736
Scott: I can see it all for free.

548
00:27:01,796 --> 00:27:03,386
Scott: I'm not going to pay unless I get to go.

549
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:05,338
Rym: You don't want to support the Ted organization.

550
00:27:05,358 --> 00:27:06,547
Scott: I would like to support them.

551
00:27:06,587 --> 00:27:07,635
Scott: I support them by watching.

552
00:27:07,675 --> 00:27:10,090
Scott: And by watching, I increase their numbers because they have ads.

553
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:13,832
Rym: I did learn how to nominate people to get a Ted talk.

554
00:27:13,852 --> 00:27:15,602
Scott: Don't you have to be a Ted person already?

555
00:27:16,025 --> 00:27:16,126
Scott: No.

556
00:27:16,146 --> 00:27:17,655
Scott: Then you can nominate someone else.

557
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:21,737
Scott: Well, you can know, it's sort of a, you know, invite only inside out thing.

558
00:27:21,838 --> 00:27:23,105
Rym: No, you can just dominate people.

559
00:27:23,387 --> 00:27:23,790
Scott: Okay.

560
00:27:24,051 --> 00:27:25,601
Rym: And there's all this stuff you have to fill out.

561
00:27:25,661 --> 00:27:26,788
Rym: It's a pretty intense form.

562
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:31,274
Rym: And the thing is, I can't think of anyone worthy who hasn't already given one that I know of.

563
00:27:31,576 --> 00:27:31,757
Scott: Yeah.

564
00:27:32,139 --> 00:27:33,908
Scott: We tend to not know those kinds of people.

565
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:37,986
Rym: And I thought for a second, Oh, I'll nominate myself.

566
00:27:38,107 --> 00:27:39,773
Rym: And that, that felt so sleazy.

567
00:27:40,316 --> 00:27:40,557
Scott: Yeah.

568
00:27:40,677 --> 00:27:44,898
Scott: The thing is you compare yourself to like even the lowliest person at Ted.

569
00:27:44,918 --> 00:27:46,286
Scott: It's like not even close.

570
00:27:46,346 --> 00:27:47,392
Rym: I'm just like a lowly worm.

571
00:27:47,553 --> 00:27:47,895
Scott: Yeah.

572
00:27:48,197 --> 00:27:51,855
Scott: It's anyway, my thing of the day, some guy made this cool website.

573
00:27:51,896 --> 00:27:55,995
Scott: He's got penguin books, science fiction covers, uh, through the years.

574
00:27:56,015 --> 00:28:01,686
Scott: So you can go year by year and look at like all the book covers and see the art of them and how it changed.

575
00:28:01,766 --> 00:28:04,843
Scott: And it's a, it's a very good, a lesson in design.

576
00:28:04,903 --> 00:28:07,096
Scott: And there's a lot of cool book covers going on.

577
00:28:07,357 --> 00:28:08,363
Scott: It's very, very nice.

578
00:28:09,086 --> 00:28:10,030
Scott: I like this kind of action.

579
00:28:10,492 --> 00:28:12,602
Rym: So I can't believe, Oh, you have more to say?

580
00:28:12,904 --> 00:28:14,712
Scott: No, I just like, I like book covers a lot.

581
00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:16,602
Rym: Gabe would like.

582
00:28:16,622 --> 00:28:21,187
Scott: it has a lot of, uh, spaceships, you know, with a planet and a rocket kind of like how.

583
00:28:21,247 --> 00:28:24,040
Rym: I really like old video game box cover art.

584
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:24,662
Rym: Yeah.

585
00:28:24,722 --> 00:28:24,964
Rym: Right.

586
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:28,344
Rym: And I don't like new video game box cover art because all looks the same.

587
00:28:28,364 --> 00:28:29,470
Rym: Hmm.

588
00:28:29,972 --> 00:28:31,559
Rym: I mean, remember like mega man too.

589
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:37,565
Rym: Like there was a, uh, anyway, so people have been asking us to do how to not suck episodes again.

590
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:42,851
Rym: And independently of that, people have suggested that we do food episodes again.

591
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:51,404
Scott: I don't know what you people, what it is with eating, chew your food, swallow, use the utensils properly.

592
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:52,528
Rym: Don't eat too much.

593
00:28:52,548 --> 00:28:53,653
Scott: Don't eat too much.

594
00:28:53,673 --> 00:28:56,545
Rym: Eat mostly plants and grain, which are plants.

595
00:28:57,148 --> 00:28:57,450
Rym: Yes.

596
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,133
Rym: A little bit of meat.

597
00:28:58,616 --> 00:28:58,817
Scott: Yep.

598
00:28:59,078 --> 00:29:04,620
Scott: Not so much trans fat, zero trans fat, but specifically you can eat sugar though.

599
00:29:05,101 --> 00:29:09,056
Rym: Someone suggested to do a show on how to not suck at eating out.

600
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:18,731
Rym: And I was intrigued by this because I didn't think people had trouble, but no, the thing is you didn't think people had trouble, but then I think no, I have proof that people have trouble.

601
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:20,884
Scott: I actually think about my experiences.

602
00:29:20,964 --> 00:29:24,080
Scott: And I realize a lot of people who aren't me have trouble.

603
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:30,934
Rym: You want to, uh, you want absolute proof that people have difficulty eating out properly drive by a cracker barrel.

604
00:29:31,255 --> 00:29:33,183
Rym: There are people in that parking lot.

605
00:29:33,203 --> 00:29:34,929
Rym: There are cars parked there.

606
00:29:34,949 --> 00:29:35,632
Rym: A lot of them.

607
00:29:37,178 --> 00:29:39,726
Rym: Well, I'll qualify that there are cars parked there after 1130 AM.

608
00:29:39,786 --> 00:29:40,067
Rym: All right.

609
00:29:45,622 --> 00:29:49,500
Scott: So rule number one, don't go to fast food unless you have no choice.

610
00:29:49,981 --> 00:29:50,223
Rym: Yeah.

611
00:29:50,424 --> 00:29:50,565
Scott: Yeah.

612
00:29:50,605 --> 00:29:56,239
Scott: I mean, a lot of people out there, you might love you some McDonald's, but you're basically just poisoning yourself to death.

613
00:29:56,259 --> 00:29:58,231
Scott: I mean, it's as bad as, you know, smoking.

614
00:29:58,573 --> 00:30:04,304
Scott: So just don't, don't eat there ever unless you, you know, you're hungry and there's absolutely nothing else you can do.

615
00:30:04,364 --> 00:30:08,365
Rym: I won't quite take that tack because as a kid, I had a lot of fast food.

616
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:09,391
Rym: Yeah.

617
00:30:09,411 --> 00:30:19,054
Rym: You know how many times I ate at Arby's and got like some chicken strips and every day in the summer when I was like a sophomore or junior in high school, I would get in my car.

618
00:30:19,075 --> 00:30:20,762
Rym: I drive to Arby's.

619
00:30:21,144 --> 00:30:27,230
Rym: I get like curly fries and like the biggest sandwich, the big Montana and a Jamoca shake.

620
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:33,305
Scott: One, one, uh, I remember my dad picked me up from summer camp once and we went to Arby's on the way home and he had the big Montana.

621
00:30:33,466 --> 00:30:43,279
Scott: And then he got sick where I always had, you know, every time I went there, I always got, you know, the chicken, whatever the curly fries and a shake, but the key, I am too smart.

622
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,485
Scott: I do not go there anymore.

623
00:30:44,505 --> 00:30:46,073
Rym: The key was the Jamoca shake.

624
00:30:46,937 --> 00:30:50,855
Rym: I got a shake and I would eat a Taco Bell pretty often.

625
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:54,530
Rym: I'll still occasionally eat a Taco Bell if I'm desperate.

626
00:30:55,313 --> 00:31:00,573
Rym: I guess I've got a hierarchy now where there's this waiting of how desperate am I?

627
00:31:01,075 --> 00:31:01,998
Rym: What's nearby?

628
00:31:02,018 --> 00:31:06,718
Rym: And the more desperate I am, the further I'll go or the lower I'll go.

629
00:31:06,738 --> 00:31:06,798
Scott: Yes.

630
00:31:07,361 --> 00:31:10,602
Scott: But the thing is it, I have to be quite desperate to go to like a subway.

631
00:31:10,623 --> 00:31:22,462
Rym: I had to be even more desperate to go someplace like, you know, a burger, you know, I think my order is pretty much at the top of the fast food chain is the like, well, White Castle because White Castle is awesome.

632
00:31:22,523 --> 00:31:26,985
Scott: The top are the places that are sort of like not quite fast food, right?

633
00:31:27,045 --> 00:31:31,706
Scott: Like a quiz nose or like a five guys or, you know, those, those sorts of things.

634
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:32,008
Scott: Right.

635
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,028
Scott: And then you got subways sort of like the barrier, right?

636
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:36,920
Scott: Cause it's sort of like, it's actually a sandwich.

637
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:37,785
Scott: You go there, right?

638
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:42,496
Scott: I like, they got that nice, the chicken teriyaki sandwich where like they microwave a little bit of chicken.

639
00:31:42,577 --> 00:31:43,804
Rym: It's not really bad for you.

640
00:31:43,824 --> 00:31:45,151
Rym: Cause it's just bread and lettuce.

641
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:56,539
Scott: You know, then they got like a chocolate chip cookie, which is just a chocolate, you know, then at least their food isn't like full of trans fat and nasty, horrible chemicals, you know, it's just normal, cheap sandwich.

642
00:31:56,579 --> 00:31:59,737
Rym: But I think going down the line, it's a Arby's, but only the chicken.

643
00:31:59,757 --> 00:32:00,340
Rym: Yeah.

644
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,841
Scott: Arby's I, you know, I just, not that Arby's is any healthier than the others.

645
00:32:03,861 --> 00:32:06,130
Scott: I just sort of like it more.

646
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:08,440
Scott: So I'm more willing to eat there.

647
00:32:08,581 --> 00:32:12,305
Scott: Cause you know, it's like, well, it's just as poisonous as McDonald's, but I like it more.

648
00:32:12,426 --> 00:32:15,643
Scott: So it goes, and then you got like a Wendy's a little bit better.

649
00:32:15,703 --> 00:32:19,702
Rym: Wendy's really only for the dollar menu and those, uh, uh, frosty.

650
00:32:19,742 --> 00:32:21,171
Scott: You get the chicken nuggets are okay.

651
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:21,694
Scott: There you go.

652
00:32:21,714 --> 00:32:23,785
Rym: They have vanilla Frosty's now.

653
00:32:23,805 --> 00:32:24,628
Scott: Yeah, I know.

654
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:25,713
Rym: That's crazy.

655
00:32:25,793 --> 00:32:26,095
Scott: It is.

656
00:32:26,215 --> 00:32:28,084
Rym: I had one really at the airport.

657
00:32:28,144 --> 00:32:28,446
Rym: Wow.

658
00:32:28,788 --> 00:32:31,059
Rym: And you know what, you know, it was in it Oreos.

659
00:32:32,461 --> 00:32:32,762
Scott: Damn.

660
00:32:33,306 --> 00:32:37,610
Scott: And then, you know, you start going down a little bit and you, I think the bottom is Jack in the box.

661
00:32:38,012 --> 00:32:45,099
Scott: I think the bottom is like those really nasty places like Burger King and Burger King KFC, right?

662
00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:47,392
Scott: Those sorts of really, really nasty shit.

663
00:32:47,472 --> 00:32:47,593
Rym: Yeah.

664
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,303
Rym: McDonald's is even above Burger King.

665
00:32:49,423 --> 00:32:54,932
Scott: McDonald's is sort of like the barrier between like fast food and the terrible fast food.

666
00:32:55,052 --> 00:33:01,145
Rym: It's weird though, because McDonald's and I'm not the only one, a lot of people agree with me, the breakfast, not that bad.

667
00:33:01,165 --> 00:33:13,793
Scott: Well, the thing is I won't eat the breakfast like on purpose, you know, but I mean, it's, it's edible, but it's weird how McDonald's breakfast rates a lot higher than most other fast food places, but McDonald's anything else now?

668
00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:16,872
Scott: I think that I just have an advantage of being in New York city.

669
00:33:16,892 --> 00:33:18,826
Scott: You can just go to any deli and get a breakfast sandwich.

670
00:33:18,846 --> 00:33:20,582
Scott: So why would you go to McDonald's to get a breakfast?

671
00:33:20,622 --> 00:33:27,644
Rym: Oh no, I only get breakfast sandwiches if I'm in like some other heathen city and it doesn't have like a deli and ask for a breakfast sandwich.

672
00:33:27,665 --> 00:33:28,310
Scott: You know what they do?

673
00:33:28,451 --> 00:33:29,298
Scott: They take two eggs.

674
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:30,607
Scott: They break them on the griddle.

675
00:33:30,969 --> 00:33:31,855
Scott: They take some bacon.

676
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:32,942
Scott: They put it on the griddle.

677
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:36,003
Scott: They take a Thomas English muffin, just like from the grocery store.

678
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:38,840
Scott: They take a piece of cheese, just like from the grocery store.

679
00:33:39,281 --> 00:33:41,491
Scott: They put it together and then you eat it.

680
00:33:41,692 --> 00:33:42,094
Scott: And it's like $2.

681
00:33:42,094 --> 00:33:46,197
Scott: And it's like, um, why would I go to McDonald's and get there?

682
00:33:46,238 --> 00:33:53,595
Scott: Like manufactured process stuff when I can go and get basically exactly like what I would make in my house for $2.

683
00:33:53,595 --> 00:33:57,537
Rym: But I've been in cities where there's just, there's nothing around and you're stuck.

684
00:33:57,879 --> 00:33:58,100
Scott: Yeah.

685
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,092
Scott: That's it's basically middle of nowhere.

686
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:05,397
Rym: that like when I was in a Columbia in Columbia, where, uh, it's near DC.

687
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:09,645
Rym: I don't know if it was actually in Maryland or what, or how about when we were at Silicon, right?

688
00:34:09,705 --> 00:34:12,482
Scott: They had one fancy restaurant, that Italian place, right?

689
00:34:12,743 --> 00:34:15,252
Scott: And then there was a Wendy's and a Denny's.

690
00:34:16,156 --> 00:34:18,866
Scott: It's like, well, we don't have much choice.

691
00:34:18,906 --> 00:34:21,803
Rym: We ate at that Denny's with, uh, entertainment system.

692
00:34:21,884 --> 00:34:22,226
Rym: We did.

693
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:25,387
Rym: And that was when we learned that they're all kind of jerks and they all smoke.

694
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:27,904
Scott: Well, one guy, the guy who played Pokemon was okay.

695
00:34:27,945 --> 00:34:30,844
Rym: He was cool, but everyone else was just kind of, kind of, kind of bitches.

696
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:31,507
Scott: Yeah.

697
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:32,873
Rym: I just, it was weird.

698
00:34:32,934 --> 00:34:35,286
Rym: I remember that very in stark detail.

699
00:34:35,368 --> 00:34:36,192
Scott: It was kind of weird.

700
00:34:36,212 --> 00:34:37,077
Scott: Yeah.

701
00:34:37,339 --> 00:34:42,590
Rym: Anyway, but we don't want to just talk about fast food, but talk about actual sitting down food.

702
00:34:43,112 --> 00:34:43,353
Rym: Yeah.

703
00:34:43,755 --> 00:34:45,967
Rym: Uh, don't go to stuff on the walls, restaurants either.

704
00:34:46,027 --> 00:34:48,103
Rym: They're, they're all the same and they're not good.

705
00:34:48,163 --> 00:34:50,534
Scott: Friday's Ruby Tuesday, et cetera, et cetera.

706
00:34:50,936 --> 00:34:51,197
Scott: Right.

707
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:52,364
Scott: All of those plays.

708
00:34:52,405 --> 00:34:54,905
Scott: I mean, there are restaurants that have stuff on the walls that are okay.

709
00:34:54,985 --> 00:34:56,192
Scott: Like, uh, fun rockers.

710
00:34:56,554 --> 00:34:57,600
Rym: It's a sliding scale.

711
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:04,980
Rym: Like I think the top, top, top of the equivalent of a stuff on the walls is the Outback because that's equivalent to a stuff on the walls.

712
00:35:05,161 --> 00:35:07,178
Rym: I say, yeah, it is the kind of food you get.

713
00:35:07,218 --> 00:35:12,188
Rym: I mean, Outback is definitely a stuff on the walls, but I feel like it is the pinnacle of stuff on the walls.

714
00:35:12,248 --> 00:35:17,016
Rym: beyond that you're in a real restaurant and below that you're at Ruby Tuesday getting the runs.

715
00:35:17,298 --> 00:35:17,539
Scott: Yeah.

716
00:35:19,102 --> 00:35:27,516
Scott: I mean, the main problem with the stuff on the walls restaurants is that almost everything on the menu, not everything, you know, but almost everything is the quadra effect of it's either.

717
00:35:27,536 --> 00:35:29,586
Scott: it's either cool range, right?

718
00:35:29,606 --> 00:35:32,499
Scott: It's like bacon, cheese, cool ranch, et cetera.

719
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:32,740
Scott: Right.

720
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,166
Scott: And, or mayonnaise.

721
00:35:34,548 --> 00:35:43,016
Scott: And it's like every meal is either the same as the other ones, uh, not good fried or that's it, you know?

722
00:35:43,036 --> 00:35:49,332
Scott: So it's, it's not good to eat there, especially considering, you know, those places aren't too cheap for the same price.

723
00:35:49,372 --> 00:35:52,530
Scott: You can go to like a diner and get something better or, you know, good.

724
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:59,653
Scott: Like, you know, any number of you can go to like an actual Italian restaurant for the same price as the stuff on the walls, what people often overlook.

725
00:35:59,834 --> 00:36:02,929
Rym: And here's, this is aimed primarily at college kids.

726
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:10,949
Rym: If you want to eat and you don't have money and you got a bunch of friends, go to a stuff on the walls place and order nothing but appetizers.

727
00:36:11,351 --> 00:36:11,672
Scott: Yeah.

728
00:36:11,973 --> 00:36:15,492
Scott: Cause they always have mad appetizer deals at those kinds of places.

729
00:36:15,593 --> 00:36:18,331
Rym: Get yourself like four orders of fried mozzarella sticks.

730
00:36:18,351 --> 00:36:18,874
Rym: You're good to go.

731
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:19,478
Rym: Yeah.

732
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:24,368
Scott: I mean, it's like we would, uh, way back, we'd go to Applebee's, which is like a place you should never go.

733
00:36:24,388 --> 00:36:24,851
Rym: Oh my God.

734
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:25,980
Rym: After all the R wag meetings.

735
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:26,322
Rym: Yeah.

736
00:36:26,403 --> 00:36:30,231
Rym: Because they gave you a half off on all the appetite when they gave us half off on the appetizers.

737
00:36:30,251 --> 00:36:31,278
Scott: Cause he went on Tuesday.

738
00:36:31,459 --> 00:36:31,660
Scott: Right.

739
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,846
Scott: And we were in a large group.

740
00:36:33,348 --> 00:36:38,077
Scott: So everyone would buy a ton of advertising, but then they realized what was going on.

741
00:36:38,137 --> 00:36:38,962
Rym: Cause we'd always show up.

742
00:36:38,982 --> 00:36:39,183
Rym: Right.

743
00:36:39,304 --> 00:36:46,515
Rym: So it'd be like 20 to 30 people take over this Applebee's and everyone will order the nachos for like four bucks.

744
00:36:47,197 --> 00:36:56,211
Rym: And the nachos cost them probably more than four bucks to make, because I remember after a couple of months of this, there was a little thing on the menu saying, does not apply to nachos.

745
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:56,915
Scott: Yeah.

746
00:36:56,935 --> 00:37:02,502
Scott: But even so you like cheese steaks and all sorts of, you know, fried, like a fried platter, all kinds of stuff.

747
00:37:02,562 --> 00:37:09,602
Rym: Anyway, remember the Applebee's because we'll have to come back to the Applebee's because the Applebee's taught me a very important lesson.

748
00:37:09,884 --> 00:37:10,206
Scott: Oh yes.

749
00:37:10,266 --> 00:37:11,413
Scott: That is the most important lesson.

750
00:37:11,434 --> 00:37:15,463
Scott: I think it's the most important thing we have to teach tonight, but we'll come back to that at the end.

751
00:37:15,504 --> 00:37:16,732
Rym: Just remember Applebee's.

752
00:37:16,792 --> 00:37:26,136
Rym: we will return, but no, we're talking now about real fucking restaurants as in a restaurant that has a name and that name is not anywhere else yet.

753
00:37:26,638 --> 00:37:28,003
Scott: Oh, you know what I found out recently?

754
00:37:28,023 --> 00:37:31,958
Scott: Olive garden, Capitol grill, same company.

755
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:32,420
Rym: Really?

756
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:32,740
Rym: Yep.

757
00:37:33,002 --> 00:37:33,927
Rym: That's interesting to know.

758
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:34,268
Rym: Yep.

759
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:38,930
Rym: Well, I should qualify that there are restaurants that are changed, right?

760
00:37:38,971 --> 00:37:43,613
Scott: There are restaurants, you know, chain, you know, it's like a stuff on the walls is a chain, right?

761
00:37:44,497 --> 00:37:47,633
Scott: But there are chains that are not stuff on the wall.

762
00:37:47,693 --> 00:37:49,461
Rym: Case in point, the Capitol grill, right?

763
00:37:49,481 --> 00:37:56,474
Scott: The Capitol grill is an actual, very fancy high class steakhouse, but it's also a chain there in many cities.

764
00:37:56,815 --> 00:37:57,077
Rym: Yes.

765
00:37:57,137 --> 00:38:02,100
Rym: Capitol grill is basically a New York city style steakhouse, but they're in other cities.

766
00:38:02,201 --> 00:38:07,616
Rym: So if you don't live in New York city, you can go to a Capitol grill and you'll find out what a New York city steakhouse is like.

767
00:38:07,797 --> 00:38:07,958
Rym: Yeah.

768
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:10,455
Scott: I mean, there's one in New York, but there's one in Baltimore.

769
00:38:10,737 --> 00:38:12,487
Scott: I'm sure there's one in California somewhere.

770
00:38:12,507 --> 00:38:14,176
Scott: I got to go to the website.

771
00:38:14,196 --> 00:38:14,941
Scott: They list all of them.

772
00:38:15,142 --> 00:38:18,542
Rym: I got to tell you, I, we, we tricked a vendor into buying us lunch there one day.

773
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:21,330
Scott: Did you, did you buy his stuff?

774
00:38:22,212 --> 00:38:25,968
Scott: No, he bought you steaks and you didn't buy anything from him.

775
00:38:26,029 --> 00:38:27,338
Rym: He didn't buy me just any steak.

776
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:34,269
Rym: He bought me an inch and a half thick, like almost completely raw steak that was seared black on the outside.

777
00:38:34,309 --> 00:38:38,548
Rym: You know, it was seasoned with sugar, sugar, just sugar.

778
00:38:38,628 --> 00:38:39,312
Scott: That's a good way to go.

779
00:38:39,432 --> 00:38:42,204
Rym: That was the second best steak I've ever had in my life.

780
00:38:42,606 --> 00:38:43,910
Rym: All right.

781
00:38:44,693 --> 00:38:52,085
Scott: So step one, when going to a real restaurant, deciding which real restaurant to go to, this is impossible in the front row crew.

782
00:38:52,688 --> 00:38:58,640
Scott: Well, you know, the problem is, is whatever kind of restaurant you pick, which is usually associated with some nationality.

783
00:38:59,322 --> 00:39:02,616
Scott: If your group is too big, someone is going to veto, right?

784
00:39:03,198 --> 00:39:16,538
Scott: So what you really basically have to do is if you're someone else is vetoing, you're basically going to have to sort of screw someone, you know, and if they can't deal with that, then, you know, just get rid of them.

785
00:39:16,558 --> 00:39:18,289
Scott: Tell them to save the drama for someone else.

786
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:21,692
Rym: Really the simplest way about this is you should be able to eat.

787
00:39:21,752 --> 00:39:22,236
Rym: And you know what?

788
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,424
Scott: That's what I was just about to say.

789
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:23,787
Rym: No, no, no.

790
00:39:23,807 --> 00:39:24,311
Rym: Wait, wait, wait.

791
00:39:24,412 --> 00:39:25,802
Rym: I'm going to go one step further.

792
00:39:26,505 --> 00:39:31,838
Rym: You can eat at any kind of restaurant because like we have friends who say like, oh, they don't want to eat at Indian places.

793
00:39:31,899 --> 00:39:39,093
Rym: But if you look at the menu, there is stuff that anyone will eat on every menu of just about every restaurant in the world.

794
00:39:39,133 --> 00:39:45,766
Scott: Well, I mean, there are some people who are like crazy picky, like, you know, I mean, this picky, like, oh, I don't want that.

795
00:39:45,786 --> 00:39:46,330
Scott: I don't want that.

796
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:47,560
Scott: But there's crazy picky.

797
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,244
Scott: Like I know people who literally they eat like chicken and French fries and that is it.

798
00:39:51,547 --> 00:40:00,244
Rym: Well, I remember for the longest time, your brother was like that where I go visit you at your house and your parents would make like awesome steaks and they'd make your brother a chicken filet because that's all he would eat.

799
00:40:00,305 --> 00:40:01,532
Scott: He's better than that now.

800
00:40:02,014 --> 00:40:08,288
Scott: But I mean, there are people I know who exist that are like like that and are older than us, like 30 or 40 something.

801
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:09,456
Rym: Not in the front row crew, though.

802
00:40:09,537 --> 00:40:10,482
Scott: No, not the front row crew.

803
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:14,356
Scott: But, you know, so you think about yourself.

804
00:40:14,376 --> 00:40:18,397
Scott: You should be able to eat at any restaurant, no matter what restaurant is picked.

805
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,926
Scott: You might not be in the mood.

806
00:40:19,946 --> 00:40:22,199
Scott: It might not be the best, but there should.

807
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:25,197
Scott: if you're hungry, there will be something there for you to eat.

808
00:40:25,258 --> 00:40:29,583
Scott: You have to be, you know, you have to be able to accept that and be willing to go anywhere.

809
00:40:29,965 --> 00:40:35,014
Scott: You know, you can have a preference, but you should never sort of had to, you know, completely object.

810
00:40:35,034 --> 00:40:38,550
Scott: You know, I mean, like I always I never want to go to the Indian restaurant.

811
00:40:39,032 --> 00:40:43,475
Scott: But when we go, I go and I eat something, you know, it doesn't kill me.

812
00:40:43,495 --> 00:40:45,787
Scott: I think the mango is the reason you go.

813
00:40:45,807 --> 00:40:47,595
Scott: Well, the mango is excellent.

814
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:52,174
Scott: But, you know, there are places I would rather go, but I go anyway.

815
00:40:52,595 --> 00:40:56,340
Scott: You know, Scott Johnson doesn't like the cafe, Maya, because he doesn't like peppers and onions.

816
00:40:56,881 --> 00:41:01,080
Scott: But he goes anyway because he's not, you know, well, he is.

817
00:41:03,142 --> 00:41:04,287
Scott: But he goes anyway.

818
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:08,386
Rym: The real key is and this is always like the critical balance, not just in food, but in life.

819
00:41:09,149 --> 00:41:14,029
Rym: The careful choosing between the two opposite ends of this one spectrum.

820
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,138
Rym: on the far left is adventure.

821
00:41:16,499 --> 00:41:18,809
Rym: On the far right is known goodness.

822
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:19,271
Rym: Yep.

823
00:41:19,893 --> 00:41:23,313
Scott: I like you're obviously never going to go to a restaurant that you know is bad, right?

824
00:41:23,353 --> 00:41:24,783
Scott: We're assuming that right off the bat.

825
00:41:24,844 --> 00:41:30,498
Scott: So there's restaurants you're familiar with that are good, which means you'll go to them or restaurants that are unknown.

826
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:31,363
Scott: No one has been there.

827
00:41:32,087 --> 00:41:39,926
Scott: And the strategy is if you've never been to a restaurant, go with only a few people like maybe one or two because you want to go with more than once.

828
00:41:39,966 --> 00:41:45,658
Scott: You can try multiple dishes, but you don't want to go too many because if it sucks, you're wasting a lot of money.

829
00:41:45,698 --> 00:41:47,350
Rym: This really only applies if you've got a crew.

830
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:54,487
Rym: I mean, if the front row crew is together and we're going to a restaurant that is between 10 and 25 people at any given time.

831
00:41:54,507 --> 00:41:55,151
Scott: That's a lot of people.

832
00:41:55,211 --> 00:42:01,544
Rym: So if we take 20 people to a restaurant that no one's been to before and it sucks, 20 people got screwed.

833
00:42:01,564 --> 00:42:02,087
Scott: That's right.

834
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:08,542
Rym: So we'll send scouts ahead like Emily and I will go try a restaurant and we'll come back and be like, that place sucked.

835
00:42:08,743 --> 00:42:10,712
Rym: We're not going there ever again.

836
00:42:10,812 --> 00:42:11,033
Scott: Yeah.

837
00:42:11,636 --> 00:42:15,737
Scott: So you got to test with a few people, but if it's known goodness, it's known goodness.

838
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:16,360
Rym: Yes.

839
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:20,745
Rym: Now, if you've got, you got to kind of in your local area, build up the list of standbys.

840
00:42:20,765 --> 00:42:26,214
Rym: You've got to have like five or six restaurants that are the standbys that you can always go to no matter what.

841
00:42:26,516 --> 00:42:26,717
Scott: Yep.

842
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:31,984
Rym: And then you have the few special place, keep the hours of the restaurants in mind quite often.

843
00:42:32,045 --> 00:42:39,370
Scott: You know, if you don't know what the hours are, it might be like nine o'clock and you like, Hey, let's go to the something, something you forget that it's lunch only.

844
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,275
Scott: You're like, Oh crap.

845
00:42:40,717 --> 00:42:41,842
Rym: And then it's diner time.

846
00:42:41,923 --> 00:42:42,264
Rym: Yup.

847
00:42:42,846 --> 00:42:43,408
Scott: It's no good.

848
00:42:44,572 --> 00:42:46,158
Scott: Um, secondly, you know what?

849
00:42:46,178 --> 00:42:50,642
Rym: This applies to dishes too, because the cafe Maya has some of the best Mexican food ever.

850
00:42:50,722 --> 00:42:51,969
Rym: Like that's, Oh my God.

851
00:42:52,009 --> 00:42:52,692
Rym: It's pretty.

852
00:42:52,813 --> 00:42:54,964
Scott: I really, I haven't even found a place in the city.

853
00:42:55,004 --> 00:42:55,747
Scott: That's as good as that.

854
00:42:55,968 --> 00:43:08,155
Rym: The cafe Maya in fish kill New York, but there's a couple of, there's one in Waffensters falls all expansions of it, but the central one in fish kill, like it is famous in the mid Hudson Valley as like this awesome place.

855
00:43:08,517 --> 00:43:09,423
Scott: It's fucking amazing.

856
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:13,352
Rym: You want to eat there for dinner and like Saturday night, there's like an hour or two hour wait.

857
00:43:13,433 --> 00:43:15,626
Scott: I was just about to talk about weights, right?

858
00:43:15,646 --> 00:43:16,009
Rym: All right.

859
00:43:16,049 --> 00:43:19,585
Rym: You've got to be willing to fucking bail immediately, right?

860
00:43:19,685 --> 00:43:21,795
Scott: When you show up at a restaurant, right?

861
00:43:22,298 --> 00:43:27,782
Scott: You have to already know before you even get there, how long you're willing to wait, right?

862
00:43:28,364 --> 00:43:35,797
Scott: And if the wait time is longer than that, just get in your car and go, don't like stand around and do the hokey pokey.

863
00:43:35,837 --> 00:43:40,590
Scott: Cause you're basically just, you know, you're basically screwing yourself by going to walk up and be like, how long's the wait?

864
00:43:40,631 --> 00:43:43,589
Rym: And if they say half hour and you're not willing to wait, you say, Oh, nevermind.

865
00:43:43,951 --> 00:43:44,172
Rym: Yup.

866
00:43:44,876 --> 00:43:53,037
Scott: And when they say half hour, pretend they said 45 minutes, you know, if they say 45 minutes, pretend they said an hour, unless it's the sick of tie.

867
00:43:53,118 --> 00:43:54,366
Rym: Fuck you sick of tie, right?

868
00:43:54,628 --> 00:43:57,787
Scott: You know, if the restaurant won't tell you what the weight is, just leave.

869
00:43:57,807 --> 00:43:59,193
Scott: You're wasting your time there.

870
00:43:59,414 --> 00:44:02,232
Rym: You know, now you might say Rym and Scott, you're smart.

871
00:44:02,312 --> 00:44:04,524
Rym: Why don't you just get reservations up this?

872
00:44:05,025 --> 00:44:07,814
Rym: If you can get reservations, get them.

873
00:44:08,115 --> 00:44:17,316
Rym: But I will warn you, if you live in an area where there are a lot of popular restaurants and a lot of people, pretty much no good restaurant is going to take reservations.

874
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,744
Scott: Or if they do take reservations, you're not gonna be able to get one unless you call way ahead.

875
00:44:21,765 --> 00:44:25,166
Scott: And if you're, you know, it's hard to decide where to eat that far in advance.

876
00:44:25,186 --> 00:44:26,535
Scott: Cause what kind of mood will you get?

877
00:44:26,616 --> 00:44:37,920
Rym: Seriously, like pretty much every good restaurant in New York and in this area, except for the ultra fancy ones, like they won't, they don't take reservations because they're going to be full no matter what, for all the hours they're open.

878
00:44:38,081 --> 00:44:47,693
Scott: reservations are for when you're going to have like a party with a schedule, you know, like, Hey, such and such day as someone's anniversary, let's get a reservation for 25 people at the fancy house.

879
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,965
Scott: You know, that's what a reservation is for.

880
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:52,619
Scott: Reservations are not for really anything else.

881
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:54,950
Rym: What you can do is try the call ahead.

882
00:44:55,131 --> 00:44:56,498
Rym: The call ahead is a special thing.

883
00:44:56,538 --> 00:45:00,485
Rym: And that is the way I have gotten reservations from places that don't do reservations.

884
00:45:00,505 --> 00:45:03,322
Scott: You say, Hey, you guys full, what's your weight before you go there?

885
00:45:03,443 --> 00:45:08,902
Rym: Or you call him and remember you, you can't just call him and ask because then they're either going to lie or they're going to say, yeah, we don't know.

886
00:45:08,942 --> 00:45:12,045
Scott: Just show up or they won't even pick up the phone and don't say the word reservation.

887
00:45:12,105 --> 00:45:15,564
Rym: You call and you just ask like, Hey, listen, I got like 30 people.

888
00:45:16,207 --> 00:45:18,539
Rym: And in an hour or so, we're going to come by your place.

889
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:19,484
Rym: You think you can handle that?

890
00:45:20,207 --> 00:45:31,865
Rym: And now, instead of just, you're not asking them for something anymore, you are offering them 30 people worth of food and big groups tend to tip extravagantly and order more food than they otherwise would.

891
00:45:32,127 --> 00:45:38,885
Rym: If the individuals came by themselves, you can also put them all around one table, one waiter handles it all, all the orders come in at once.

892
00:45:39,247 --> 00:45:40,394
Rym: Restaurants love you.

893
00:45:40,515 --> 00:45:48,130
Rym: If you bring a giant group, unless you're a diner in a college town, in which case they able to shut the door in your face or unless you're jerks.

894
00:45:49,073 --> 00:45:49,354
Rym: Yeah.

895
00:45:49,555 --> 00:45:49,795
Rym: Yeah.

896
00:45:49,835 --> 00:45:51,742
Rym: But we had a lot to talk about.

897
00:45:52,285 --> 00:45:54,135
Rym: We could do like a week on restaurants.

898
00:45:54,457 --> 00:45:54,577
Scott: Yeah.

899
00:45:54,598 --> 00:45:57,634
Scott: But anyway, so you got to deal with the weight intelligently.

900
00:45:57,754 --> 00:46:01,152
Scott: Don't you basically want to avoid spending a lot of time waiting?

901
00:46:01,233 --> 00:46:05,617
Scott: Cause that sucks ass, you know, be willing to just, you know, have backup places to go.

902
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:11,469
Rym: If the weights are too long at the other places, if you got the long wait, confirm the way like multiple times.

903
00:46:11,971 --> 00:46:17,122
Rym: And then everybody go to like the bookstore next door or outside and hang out for an hour and then come back.

904
00:46:17,886 --> 00:46:22,452
Rym: And if that restaurant doesn't have your table for you when you get back or they say, Hey, you weren't here.

905
00:46:22,472 --> 00:46:22,955
Rym: We gave it up.

906
00:46:23,317 --> 00:46:23,961
Rym: Never eat there again.

907
00:46:24,201 --> 00:46:24,402
Rym: Yep.

908
00:46:24,703 --> 00:46:24,924
Rym: Ever.

909
00:46:25,225 --> 00:46:25,505
Scott: All right.

910
00:46:26,488 --> 00:46:32,512
Scott: Um, so when ordering, just order food order order and don't, don't be afraid.

911
00:46:32,552 --> 00:46:36,048
Scott: Like my mom doesn't talk to waiters, you know, don't be my mom.

912
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:37,836
Scott: You have to talk to the waiter.

913
00:46:37,997 --> 00:46:40,731
Scott: order, you know, speak up, say something.

914
00:46:40,772 --> 00:46:50,892
Rym: If you didn't hear what the special was, just ask again, because every time the waiter comes, they say the four specials, they leave a few minutes later, someone in our group will be like, Hey, what was in that fish special?

915
00:46:51,113 --> 00:46:51,354
Rym: Yeah.

916
00:46:51,394 --> 00:46:52,962
Rym: No one remembers as the waiter.

917
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:53,747
Rym: Don't just order it.

918
00:46:54,009 --> 00:46:54,130
Scott: Yeah.

919
00:46:54,170 --> 00:47:03,969
Scott: I mean, go, you know, if you need some water, if you know, I mean, you know, people like sort of are afraid to like harass waiters a little bit because they're afraid of like spitting in the food number one.

920
00:47:04,633 --> 00:47:07,628
Rym: If you're getting the waiter's attention, there are ways to do it in ways not to do it.

921
00:47:08,372 --> 00:47:08,613
Scott: Yeah.

922
00:47:08,754 --> 00:47:09,820
Rym: Don't come over here.

923
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,868
Rym: Don't do the two finger in the mouth of whistle.

924
00:47:12,511 --> 00:47:19,949
Rym: Don't snap your fingers and say Garcon Garcon unless you're in the kind of restaurant where you're paying enough money to where they expect that.

925
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:20,853
Scott: Yeah.

926
00:47:21,316 --> 00:47:34,672
Scott: But you know, if you just, you know, if you just talk to them like normal people, they're not going to think you're an ass just because you, you know, talk to them a bunch, you know, like if you need a napkin, if you need new silverware, you know, just, just freaking ask for it.

927
00:47:34,712 --> 00:47:36,240
Scott: Don't and don't hesitate either.

928
00:47:36,441 --> 00:47:41,519
Scott: You know, because if you hesitate, you're just going to be sitting there like waiting for another four because you dropped yours on the floor.

929
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,485
Scott: You need that for quickly.

930
00:47:42,646 --> 00:47:46,645
Rym: Now to who's getting cold if you need the waiter, but most people do.

931
00:47:46,706 --> 00:47:47,732
Rym: And everyone does this.

932
00:47:47,773 --> 00:47:49,564
Rym: Like I watch people at other tables doing it.

933
00:47:49,947 --> 00:47:53,165
Rym: And it aggravates me to the point that I almost want to intervene on their behalf.

934
00:47:53,687 --> 00:47:56,440
Rym: If you want a waiter, just we'll look around.

935
00:47:56,701 --> 00:48:02,010
Rym: And as soon as you see anyone who works in the restaurant, just watch their face and make eye contact with them.

936
00:48:02,411 --> 00:48:13,735
Rym: Everyone seems to like, kind of look in the direction of a waiter kind of, but then if the waiter turns to them, they like avoid eye contact and kind of just like, look like they're waiting for someone, but they don't actually engage.

937
00:48:13,815 --> 00:48:17,758
Scott: And a lot of people, a lot of people like only want to talk to the waiter for their table.

938
00:48:18,019 --> 00:48:19,772
Scott: Just talk to the first one who comes by.

939
00:48:19,852 --> 00:48:27,538
Scott: Cause if like you're going to, sometimes depending on the restaurant, it might be a while before the one for your table comes back, you know, they might be hanging out.

940
00:48:27,558 --> 00:48:28,784
Scott: They might be doing other tables.

941
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:32,019
Rym: This does not apply to fancy restaurants.

942
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:40,539
Rym: I mean, if you're at like sparks in New York city, like the steakhouse, there are waiters watching your table for any discomfort and they appear and fix it.

943
00:48:41,121 --> 00:48:46,227
Rym: Like I dropped my fork, a waiter, just put another one on the table before I could reach down and get it.

944
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:47,052
Scott: Wow.

945
00:48:47,152 --> 00:48:47,736
Scott: That's good stuff.

946
00:48:47,796 --> 00:48:48,500
Rym: It was amazing.

947
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:54,701
Scott: I like, yeah, some restaurants like they'll refill the water as soon as it's empty and others, you gotta be like, Hey, can I get some water over here?

948
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:59,991
Rym: Some places will just bring another bottle of the wine you uncork it and just start pouring glasses.

949
00:49:00,635 --> 00:49:01,259
Scott: That's cause they want it.

950
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:07,682
Rym: They want you to start paying, but at the same time they're basically pouring money, but these are the kind of places where you're going to order it anyway.

951
00:49:07,723 --> 00:49:08,305
Rym: They just know.

952
00:49:08,325 --> 00:49:08,687
Rym: Yeah.

953
00:49:08,707 --> 00:49:09,731
Scott: All right.

954
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:12,263
Rym: Uh, seriously make eye contact.

955
00:49:12,544 --> 00:49:15,841
Rym: And then as soon as they make eye contact with you, don't break it.

956
00:49:16,042 --> 00:49:29,862
Scott: Look right at them and nod like, come here or give, you know, some sort of, you know, signal that is visual and perhaps audible to let them know that you want them to don't do the Lewis black, where the fuck is my food?

957
00:49:30,363 --> 00:49:30,785
Scott: Yeah.

958
00:49:31,507 --> 00:49:33,313
Scott: Yeah.

959
00:49:33,453 --> 00:49:42,357
Scott: And the thing is, you know, if your food is like, you know, not coming, you know, you know, usually what I've never had some, you know, like sometimes you might get worried.

960
00:49:42,377 --> 00:49:44,693
Scott: Like everyone else's food comes and your food doesn't come.

961
00:49:44,713 --> 00:49:47,189
Scott: You might be worried, like, Oh, do they fuck up my order?

962
00:49:47,249 --> 00:49:47,954
Scott: What's going on?

963
00:49:48,497 --> 00:49:53,873
Scott: Pretty much any time I've ever had that worry, someone always comes out and is like, yeah, your food will be ready and whatever.

964
00:49:53,894 --> 00:49:54,398
Scott: Just a minute.

965
00:49:54,478 --> 00:49:55,203
Scott: It's like, okay.

966
00:49:55,686 --> 00:50:05,581
Scott: Now it's still, if you're, if you're still worried about it, just ask now when it comes to don't ask you like quickly enough, everyone else is going to be done eating and you're still going to be eating there.

967
00:50:05,782 --> 00:50:11,726
Rym: When it comes to bad food, you've really got away the risk reward ratio here.

968
00:50:12,128 --> 00:50:16,770
Rym: If you're in a sleazy diner and your clam chowder comes out cold, just don't eat it.

969
00:50:16,991 --> 00:50:18,016
Rym: And don't ask about it.

970
00:50:18,036 --> 00:50:20,287
Rym: Just give up that $4 is gone.

971
00:50:20,427 --> 00:50:21,774
Scott: Just let it be, just let it be.

972
00:50:22,598 --> 00:50:27,590
Rym: But if you're at the fancy steakhouse and your steak isn't cooked right, and you point this out, they'll just bring another steak.

973
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:30,329
Rym: They won't even like, don't worry about them spitting in the food.

974
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:32,061
Rym: They won't even think to spit in the food.

975
00:50:32,081 --> 00:50:32,665
Rym: They don't care.

976
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:38,053
Rym: But the, basically the less you're paying for your food, the less you can get away with.

977
00:50:38,695 --> 00:50:43,360
Scott: I know it's like, you know, don't like, you know, and it depends on like the kind of complaint, right?

978
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:46,419
Scott: Like let's say you ordered a cheese, you're at a diner, right?

979
00:50:46,439 --> 00:50:50,705
Scott: And you ordered a hamburger with no cheese and it comes out with a piece of cheese, right?

980
00:50:51,811 --> 00:50:54,143
Scott: Tell them that it came up with a piece of cheese that you don't want.

981
00:50:54,244 --> 00:50:58,293
Scott: You ordered no cheese, you know, and they'll come out with another burger with no cheese on it.

982
00:50:58,313 --> 00:51:01,640
Rym: It might just be the same burger with the cheese scraped off, but that's what you get for a diner.

983
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,687
Scott: But that's fine though.

984
00:51:02,707 --> 00:51:03,251
Scott: That's what you want.

985
00:51:03,312 --> 00:51:04,078
Scott: But don't turn back.

986
00:51:04,139 --> 00:51:07,619
Scott: If you, if they bring out a burger and you say, this is medium rare.

987
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,188
Scott: I wanted it medium at the diner.

988
00:51:09,529 --> 00:51:10,937
Scott: You got, that's not good.

989
00:51:10,957 --> 00:51:11,460
Scott: Don't do that.

990
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:11,740
Rym: Yeah.

991
00:51:11,761 --> 00:51:13,972
Rym: Burgers of diners come out diner rare.

992
00:51:14,313 --> 00:51:14,655
Scott: Yeah.

993
00:51:14,957 --> 00:51:21,222
Scott: You know, medium only, only complain if they screwed up the actual order, the biggest one.

994
00:51:21,262 --> 00:51:23,655
Scott: And I don't complain about the food being bad.

995
00:51:23,896 --> 00:51:25,727
Rym: It really bothers me when I see people do this.

996
00:51:25,968 --> 00:51:33,122
Rym: And if you order wine, you know, they bring the wine out and they like pour a little bit of it for you to check and they give you the cork to look at and they show you the bottle.

997
00:51:33,805 --> 00:51:40,550
Rym: That's all one to prove to you that they're bringing you the actual wine you ordered because otherwise they're like, they don't say anything when they do this.

998
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:43,708
Scott: You're expected sort of know what's going on, the deal, right?

999
00:51:43,749 --> 00:51:48,692
Scott: But they're not like checking to see if you think the wine is good, right?

1000
00:51:48,913 --> 00:51:52,810
Rym: To see one, to prove to you, look, you ordered a 97 blah, blah, blah.

1001
00:51:53,132 --> 00:51:55,182
Rym: I have brought for you a 97 blue, right?

1002
00:51:55,202 --> 00:52:02,197
Scott: Because what could happen is some restaurant could take a bottle that says 97 blah, blah, blah on it and put in Thunderbird.

1003
00:52:02,498 --> 00:52:02,779
Scott: Right.

1004
00:52:02,939 --> 00:52:12,556
Rym: And they want to prove to you that it's not Thunderbird, but when they do this, I've seen people get the other bird is not $30 a glass and they sniff it and they sniff the cork, which is silly.

1005
00:52:12,576 --> 00:52:13,948
Rym: If you sniff the cork, you don't know what you're doing.

1006
00:52:13,969 --> 00:52:14,352
Scott: That's all right.

1007
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:15,362
Rym: Look at the car.

1008
00:52:15,422 --> 00:52:16,308
Rym: Don't sniff the car.

1009
00:52:16,328 --> 00:52:18,563
Scott: You're looking at the car to make sure it's not crumbled.

1010
00:52:18,603 --> 00:52:19,468
Scott: It should be in one piece.

1011
00:52:19,528 --> 00:52:22,543
Scott: And that means that the wine is not bad.

1012
00:52:22,663 --> 00:52:24,190
Scott: Also turned into vinegar.

1013
00:52:24,331 --> 00:52:31,269
Rym: If the wine waiter uses one of those twisty corkscrews, if you twist it in, then you pull the little levers as opposed to a wine key.

1014
00:52:31,972 --> 00:52:33,619
Rym: Don't ask them about the wine.

1015
00:52:33,659 --> 00:52:34,243
Rym: They don't know.

1016
00:52:34,505 --> 00:52:34,988
Scott: That's right.

1017
00:52:35,189 --> 00:52:36,839
Rym: They'll use like this livery wine key.

1018
00:52:36,859 --> 00:52:42,235
Rym: That means they know because at least someone, of course, you might see them twist the wine key in and then start yanking on it.

1019
00:52:42,416 --> 00:52:42,839
Rym: They don't know.

1020
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,670
Rym: that happened at a restaurant near us.

1021
00:52:45,851 --> 00:52:51,455
Scott: The skill of their bottle opening is directly in proportion to their knowledge.

1022
00:52:51,555 --> 00:52:54,792
Rym: The best bottle opening I ever got wasn't in the fancy place in New York.

1023
00:52:55,215 --> 00:52:57,827
Rym: It was from this awesome waiter in Costa Rica.

1024
00:52:58,048 --> 00:52:58,450
Scott: Really?

1025
00:52:58,611 --> 00:53:00,138
Scott: This guy, how do you open it?

1026
00:53:00,158 --> 00:53:13,001
Rym: Well, he just had like perfect, like if you were, if wine bottle opening or in the Olympics, like all those other synchronized kind of specific movement arts, this guy got a 9.8 out of 10 and maybe a seven from the Italian judge.

1027
00:53:13,362 --> 00:53:15,287
Rym: Like it was perfect.

1028
00:53:17,292 --> 00:53:20,160
Rym: I don't know if anyone will even get that.

1029
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,346
Scott: That's a good one.

1030
00:53:21,487 --> 00:53:22,674
Rym: I don't know if anyone remembers.

1031
00:53:23,077 --> 00:53:23,560
Scott: That's all right.

1032
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:31,774
Rym: Anyway, but when they pour you that little bit of wine, that is for you to taste it and tell them if the wine spoiled or not.

1033
00:53:32,015 --> 00:53:35,208
Rym: So if you don't like the wine, that's tough shit.

1034
00:53:35,328 --> 00:53:43,245
Scott: Like if you ordered, you know, a man of Shevitz and you don't like how it tastes, you think it's nasty, but it's not bad.

1035
00:53:43,285 --> 00:53:45,035
Scott: It's not like, you know, turned into vinegar.

1036
00:53:45,116 --> 00:53:48,133
Scott: It's, it is what it is and it is what it says on the bottle.

1037
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,130
Scott: But you ordered something that it turns out you don't actually like.

1038
00:53:51,612 --> 00:53:52,618
Scott: That's tough shit.

1039
00:53:52,658 --> 00:53:56,202
Scott: That's, you know, like you order a cheeseburger and then you find out you don't like cheese.

1040
00:53:56,263 --> 00:53:57,691
Scott: Well, that's your problem.

1041
00:53:57,751 --> 00:54:09,433
Rym: But now the difficulty with wine, of course, is that if you haven't had a lot of wine, you have no idea if you're fooling you or not, because there are some wines out there, some expensive ones that taste like ass.

1042
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:09,975
Scott: Yep.

1043
00:54:10,075 --> 00:54:12,307
Rym: But they, they, they're supposed to taste like ass.

1044
00:54:12,508 --> 00:54:13,434
Rym: That's what they taste like.

1045
00:54:13,494 --> 00:54:14,199
Rym: It didn't go bad.

1046
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:15,427
Rym: That's just what it tastes like.

1047
00:54:15,468 --> 00:54:15,951
Scott: That's right.

1048
00:54:15,971 --> 00:54:17,421
Scott: That's why I don't drink that shit.

1049
00:54:17,803 --> 00:54:19,211
Rym: But there's also wine that's really good.

1050
00:54:19,271 --> 00:54:19,694
Scott: That's cheap.

1051
00:54:20,317 --> 00:54:20,740
Rym: Yeah.

1052
00:54:22,381 --> 00:54:24,932
Rym: Simply, if you don't know, don't order either.

1053
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:33,036
Rym: If you're order the cheapest wine, just whatever the cheapest wine and the color that you want is order that do not order the second cheapest wine.

1054
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:37,440
Rym: The second cheapest wine on almost every menu is crappier than the cheapest wine.

1055
00:54:37,842 --> 00:54:41,502
Rym: And it is there solely for the people who are with a date or with other people.

1056
00:54:42,025 --> 00:54:46,872
Rym: And they want to be impressive and order wine, but they don't know about wine and they're cheap.

1057
00:54:47,194 --> 00:54:49,589
Rym: They don't want to order the cheapest wine because that's obvious.

1058
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:51,280
Rym: So they order the second cheapest wine.

1059
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:51,822
Scott: Right.

1060
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:55,708
Scott: One thing you can definitely do though, is some restaurants have like these safeties, right?

1061
00:54:55,829 --> 00:54:58,807
Scott: For example, the, the number one of these is the macaroni grill, right?

1062
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:01,906
Scott: Which is a chain, but it is an excellent Italian restaurant.

1063
00:55:01,987 --> 00:55:04,282
Scott: You know, I guess it's not super excellent, but it's pretty good.

1064
00:55:04,824 --> 00:55:07,455
Scott: They have wine on this honor system.

1065
00:55:07,475 --> 00:55:11,592
Scott: So you go in and if you don't know a wine to get, just get the wine.

1066
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:14,083
Scott: They have like the macaroni girl wine.

1067
00:55:14,124 --> 00:55:15,472
Scott: It comes in a gigantic jug.

1068
00:55:15,572 --> 00:55:17,202
Rym: Actually pretty much every restaurant has this.

1069
00:55:17,222 --> 00:55:18,390
Rym: It's called the house wine.

1070
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:21,450
Rym: So if you really don't know what to order at all, just order.

1071
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:24,850
Rym: I didn't think other restaurants said that order a glass of the house wine.

1072
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:31,047
Rym: Now they might ask which one, in which case, just admit to the waiter that you don't know anything about wine and ask them what they recommend.

1073
00:55:31,108 --> 00:55:34,593
Rym: And if they don't know, they will go back and ask the chef, the chef will say, give them whatever.

1074
00:55:34,734 --> 00:55:37,550
Scott: And at the very least, just try to figure out red or white.

1075
00:55:37,992 --> 00:55:41,913
Scott: Even I know that if you get that right, you're like 90% of the way there.

1076
00:55:42,174 --> 00:55:44,184
Rym: If you really don't know, drink the wine.

1077
00:55:44,305 --> 00:55:47,020
Rym: that is the color of the meat or food you were eating.

1078
00:55:48,201 --> 00:55:51,660
Rym: That's pretty much at least the closest color, but enough about wine.

1079
00:55:51,961 --> 00:55:54,875
Rym: Yes, we actually have gone on a while.

1080
00:55:54,895 --> 00:55:55,819
Scott: We got to talk about paying.

1081
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:56,161
Scott: That's it.

1082
00:55:56,542 --> 00:55:58,472
Rym: We got, there's a bunch of, uh, quick one.

1083
00:55:59,296 --> 00:56:00,642
Rym: We talked about cutting and running.

1084
00:56:00,663 --> 00:56:13,870
Rym: If you sit down at a restaurant and like you're not getting served, even if you have ordered some food, like you've ordered food and it just hasn't come and it's taking way too long, like way too long, uh, warn them that you've got to go.

1085
00:56:14,011 --> 00:56:20,765
Rym: And if they can't rectify the situation immediately, you're perfectly within your rights to just say, look, we're leaving and not pay.

1086
00:56:20,846 --> 00:56:21,127
Scott: Yes.

1087
00:56:21,147 --> 00:56:24,460
Scott: You don't have to pay until you have eaten food.

1088
00:56:24,901 --> 00:56:30,429
Scott: If they put food on the table in front of you and it is like, smells like rotten, like, Oh my God, disgusting.

1089
00:56:30,791 --> 00:56:31,675
Scott: Just get up and leave.

1090
00:56:32,057 --> 00:56:33,887
Scott: As soon as you touch the food, you have to pay.

1091
00:56:33,907 --> 00:56:34,249
Rym: Yeah.

1092
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:41,281
Rym: If you, if you try to say that the burger was bad and you want a refund and you ate all of it, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1093
00:56:41,763 --> 00:56:55,672
Scott: You have to pretty much, if you are going to not pay as soon as the point where you touch the food, you can't, you have to pay, but up until then, don't feel bad about just getting up and leaving until you, you know, cause you should, if you have a reason

1094
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:55,833
Rym: to.

1095
00:56:55,953 --> 00:56:56,214
Rym: Yep.

1096
00:56:56,315 --> 00:56:57,119
Rym: Cut and run.

1097
00:56:57,701 --> 00:56:57,821
Scott: Yep.

1098
00:56:58,864 --> 00:57:02,756
Rym: All right, paying, paying kids one, uh, tax supplies.

1099
00:57:03,157 --> 00:57:07,963
Rym: I, it, it amazes me how many people in my life don't seem to understand that there is tax at restaurants.

1100
00:57:08,204 --> 00:57:08,848
Scott: pay the tax.

1101
00:57:09,049 --> 00:57:09,210
Scott: Yeah.

1102
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:15,398
Scott: I mean like if you order something on the, on the menu, it says $15 is probably going to be like a good three, $4 tax.

1103
00:57:16,081 --> 00:57:16,564
Scott: It's really $20.

1104
00:57:16,564 --> 00:57:19,582
Scott: You're probably going to have to put down on the table, right?

1105
00:57:19,622 --> 00:57:20,967
Scott: Not 15.

1106
00:57:20,967 --> 00:57:24,019
Scott: So, uh, remember tax exists, especially like New York.

1107
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:25,083
Scott: The tax is 8%.

1108
00:57:25,083 --> 00:57:26,689
Scott: That's a lot of money.

1109
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:27,251
Rym: Yep.

1110
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:30,842
Rym: Plus, you know, tip 15 to 25%.

1111
00:57:30,842 --> 00:57:31,365
Scott: Add that in.

1112
00:57:31,385 --> 00:57:31,687
Rym: Yeah.

1113
00:57:31,707 --> 00:57:33,740
Scott: Well, I mean, tipping is a whole separate issue.

1114
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:36,397
Rym: We're not going to talk about the merits of taking tipping.

1115
00:57:36,418 --> 00:57:37,989
Scott: We're only going to talk about the reality.

1116
00:57:38,191 --> 00:57:38,332
Scott: Yeah.

1117
00:57:38,554 --> 00:57:43,747
Scott: We're not going to talk about, you know, when to, when not to, because there are some very few cases where you shouldn't tip at all.

1118
00:57:43,888 --> 00:57:44,352
Rym: Wait, you know what?

1119
00:57:44,373 --> 00:57:46,165
Scott: There are some cases where you should tip a whole bunch.

1120
00:57:46,266 --> 00:57:55,534
Rym: I will give you the, if you are playing life per game theory and you are perfectly rational and practical and acting only in your own self-interest, here's what you do.

1121
00:57:56,037 --> 00:58:02,027
Rym: If you are never going to go to a restaurant again, or it is a restaurant that will not recognize you don't tip.

1122
00:58:03,652 --> 00:58:10,352
Rym: If you're going to return to a restaurant enough to where they will recognize you tip very, very lavishly.

1123
00:58:10,372 --> 00:58:17,720
Rym: And if you tip mediocrely forever, they will always bend over backward for you.

1124
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:21,606
Rym: For as long as you go there, they'll bring free drinks, free food, free sushi, free, whatever.

1125
00:58:21,908 --> 00:58:22,130
Rym: Yep.

1126
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:23,760
Rym: The neko did that to us for a while.

1127
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,290
Rym: They give us like just free rolls.

1128
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:29,351
Scott: It's good to have a restaurant that remembers you because then you will get things.

1129
00:58:30,315 --> 00:58:31,158
Rym: Ah, Jay's diner.

1130
00:58:31,259 --> 00:58:31,459
Scott: Yep.

1131
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,797
Scott: I mean, and you don't even have to tip extravagantly to get things.

1132
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:38,193
Scott: Just tip like, you know, 17% and you'll get things.

1133
00:58:38,213 --> 00:58:39,981
Scott: Y'all like an extra dollar or two.

1134
00:58:40,001 --> 00:58:46,410
Rym: Well, of course we really love beyond at Applebee's when, uh, here's how to get into this whole, this final discussion.

1135
00:58:46,933 --> 00:58:49,425
Rym: We were at Applebee's all the time with our wag.

1136
00:58:49,446 --> 00:58:53,326
Rym: So there'd be like between 10 and 30 people who were disgusting gamers.

1137
00:58:53,809 --> 00:58:54,935
Rym: We're all friends with them though.

1138
00:58:55,398 --> 00:59:00,485
Rym: Nominally, we're all in a group and we'd all sit at like a gigantic table and then all the tables around it.

1139
00:59:00,968 --> 00:59:04,085
Rym: And in the end we'd get one gigantic check and everyone would throw in their money.

1140
00:59:04,991 --> 00:59:08,869
Rym: And I hope we all got accustomed to throwing in this certain amount and it always worked out.

1141
00:59:09,994 --> 00:59:14,278
Rym: And one day we went to Applebee's and like no one else went for some reason.

1142
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:18,928
Rym: So it was just like three of us, three or four of us sitting at a little table, hanging out, doing the same thing.

1143
00:59:18,968 --> 00:59:20,034
Rym: we always do in a small group.

1144
00:59:20,758 --> 00:59:23,558
Rym: We all threw in what we normally throw in for the same amount of food.

1145
00:59:23,598 --> 00:59:24,622
Rym: We all order the same stuff.

1146
00:59:25,744 --> 00:59:37,094
Rym: We left a 115% tip and we realized this and we started calculating what we actually owed for our food.

1147
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:40,668
Rym: And we discovered that someone was an asshole.

1148
00:59:42,133 --> 00:59:42,896
Rym: We didn't know who.

1149
00:59:43,177 --> 00:59:45,023
Rym: We only knew that it wasn't anyone with us.

1150
00:59:46,568 --> 00:59:53,800
Rym: And I've realized the crux of this is not so much that people are willfully trying to skip out on paying what they owe.

1151
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,014
Rym: There are people like that, but this was not the case.

1152
00:59:56,417 --> 00:59:58,569
Rym: I don't think I've ever run into anyone where that was the case.

1153
00:59:59,514 --> 01:00:05,646
Rym: I think people legitimately don't actually calculate how much they owe and they think they're putting in enough, but they really aren't.

1154
01:00:06,068 --> 01:00:16,869
Scott: People don't seem to realize, A, how much the tax actually is, B, how much the tip actually is, C, drinks and advertisers, what they actually cost.

1155
01:00:16,889 --> 01:00:20,528
Scott: Someone will get like, you know, I always get water, right?

1156
01:00:20,568 --> 01:00:21,071
Scott: Pretty much.

1157
01:00:21,413 --> 01:00:23,728
Scott: Or I'll get a milkshake and occasionally lemonade.

1158
01:00:23,748 --> 01:00:26,244
Scott: And that's about all I'll ever get to drink at a restaurant.

1159
01:00:26,365 --> 01:00:37,606
Rym: Most of the time, just tap water or like wine or a cocktail, something big that I pay for, like on my own, because it's like if you get like a glass of wine, it's probably going to be like five dollars at least, if not more.

1160
01:00:38,088 --> 01:00:41,403
Rym: But more importantly, sodas, soft drinks, stuff like that.

1161
01:00:41,423 --> 01:00:42,791
Scott: They charge like 250.

1162
01:00:42,791 --> 01:00:42,891
Scott: Yeah.

1163
01:00:43,394 --> 01:00:45,868
Rym: And a lot of restaurants we go to, they charge three, four.

1164
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:48,421
Rym: I've seen places charge five bucks for a soda.

1165
01:00:48,783 --> 01:00:50,550
Rym: Oftentimes they're not free refills.

1166
01:00:50,851 --> 01:00:51,132
Scott: Yep.

1167
01:00:51,534 --> 01:00:55,837
Scott: So people sort of, you know, forget like how much those things actually cost.

1168
01:00:55,858 --> 01:00:58,791
Scott: I mean, if I go to a diner, I'll get French toast for five bucks.

1169
01:00:59,334 --> 01:01:02,288
Scott: Then I'll get water, orange juice and milk.

1170
01:01:02,308 --> 01:01:04,002
Scott: And the orange juice and milk are two dollars each.

1171
01:01:04,344 --> 01:01:05,349
Scott: So it's nine dollars.

1172
01:01:05,751 --> 01:01:13,530
Scott: And people, you know, like they sort of they look at like the entree that they order on the menu and because that's the biggest, most solid price.

1173
01:01:14,012 --> 01:01:23,257
Scott: And then all the other things there, you know, a portion of an appetizer, you know, or, you know, that they shared with some people and like a drink and a refill on it.

1174
01:01:23,499 --> 01:01:28,852
Scott: You know those are small and they don't actually see those, you know, they don't look at the price of the drink on the menu.

1175
01:01:29,214 --> 01:01:30,984
Scott: So it doesn't come into their calculation.

1176
01:01:31,325 --> 01:01:33,576
Scott: So they pay, you know, maybe their entree was 15.

1177
01:01:33,576 --> 01:01:36,147
Scott: So they throw in 18.

1178
01:01:36,147 --> 01:01:41,130
Scott: They owe like 25 and they don't realize it because they weren't, you know, actually calculating.

1179
01:01:41,371 --> 01:01:41,633
Rym: Yep.

1180
01:01:41,693 --> 01:01:47,042
Rym: So one, if you're a smart person, the way to avoid this whole situation, always drink tap water.

1181
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:52,413
Rym: Well, one, if you want to save money, never order a drink, just always get water because that that's free.

1182
01:01:52,514 --> 01:01:56,417
Scott: and watch out for those restaurants that try to sell you a bottled water, say tap water.

1183
01:01:56,699 --> 01:01:56,840
Rym: Yep.

1184
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:01,337
Rym: But they have to give it to you and don't order appetizers.

1185
01:02:01,437 --> 01:02:09,477
Rym: Or if you do whatever you actually order, note exactly what it cost from the menu and remember that and calculate exactly what you owe.

1186
01:02:09,537 --> 01:02:18,102
Rym: Just take, you know, add everything up that you owe and then add like 30 percent to it to cover tax tip and everything and put that in and have these numbers handy.

1187
01:02:18,423 --> 01:02:25,659
Rym: And then when the bill comes up short, literally, the only way to deal with this is to point out, look, I got this and this and this.

1188
01:02:25,981 --> 01:02:26,827
Rym: I owed exactly this.

1189
01:02:26,867 --> 01:02:27,753
Rym: Here's the tip I put in.

1190
01:02:27,773 --> 01:02:28,377
Rym: I'm out.

1191
01:02:28,418 --> 01:02:29,142
Rym: And then leave the table.

1192
01:02:29,724 --> 01:02:29,925
Scott: Yep.

1193
01:02:30,567 --> 01:02:33,820
Rym: Because there is no way to resolve this situation.

1194
01:02:34,001 --> 01:02:36,719
Rym: And I hate to say this, but the front row crew, this happens too.

1195
01:02:37,361 --> 01:02:45,531
Rym: We're getting actually very close to figuring out who's causing the problem by eating with different combinations of people for a while and all the burning wheel games and everything.

1196
01:02:46,135 --> 01:02:46,860
Rym: We're real close.

1197
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,066
Rym: We've got to narrow down.

1198
01:02:48,106 --> 01:02:49,372
Rym: I think there are.

1199
01:02:49,654 --> 01:02:57,090
Rym: there are four suspects and it's either some or all of them who are consistently shorting the bill every time the front row crew goes out.

1200
01:02:58,277 --> 01:02:59,343
Scott: It's definitely not malicious.

1201
01:02:59,565 --> 01:03:01,740
Scott: You know, I don't think anyone's trying to short the bill.

1202
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:02,887
Scott: Everyone's throwing in money.

1203
01:03:02,988 --> 01:03:08,804
Scott: But I think there are just some people who, you know, neglect to understand, you know, the cost of what they're actually ordering.

1204
01:03:08,945 --> 01:03:13,531
Rym: Seriously, to avoid these situations for you yourself and to save money or to tap water.

1205
01:03:13,551 --> 01:03:22,200
Scott: And I mean, the worst is when I went to that Thai place and I think I paid for like three or four people's meals, you know, after I calculated how much money I actually got back.

1206
01:03:22,461 --> 01:03:24,736
Rym: Everyone actually owed with all the food we ordered.

1207
01:03:24,757 --> 01:03:26,873
Scott: I mean, that was you know, it was like this takeout place.

1208
01:03:26,913 --> 01:03:30,234
Scott: No one thought it was big money, but the bill was like over 200 dollars.

1209
01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:34,395
Rym: Well, because everyone's meal plus appetizers and drinks was like 40 bucks.

1210
01:03:34,516 --> 01:03:36,885
Scott: And everyone got like Thai's teas all around.

1211
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:38,029
Rym: Yeah.

1212
01:03:38,992 --> 01:03:39,192
Scott: Yeah.

1213
01:03:39,754 --> 01:03:41,882
Rym: But seriously, tap water is the way to go.

1214
01:03:42,104 --> 01:03:51,934
Rym: You would not believe how much money I saved when I was poor at RIT, not getting appetizers and more importantly, not sharing appetizers with other people because they will screw you.

1215
01:03:51,954 --> 01:03:52,035
Scott: Yeah.

1216
01:03:52,055 --> 01:03:54,527
Scott: I mean, how many times do you get an appetizer?

1217
01:03:54,567 --> 01:03:54,748
Scott: Right.

1218
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:59,193
Scott: And it's like a Shumai and you get one of the Shumai and the rest go away.

1219
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:02,232
Rym: You're like, but then no one else puts in money for the appetizer.

1220
01:04:02,434 --> 01:04:02,675
Rym: Right.

1221
01:04:02,695 --> 01:04:06,780
Scott: So it's like you ate one of the Shumai, even though you ordered it and you paid for all.

1222
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:12,233
Rym: the drawback of this is that you mostly when you go with a big group of people, they're going to want to split the check evenly.

1223
01:04:12,254 --> 01:04:13,622
Rym: And that only works.

1224
01:04:13,643 --> 01:04:19,683
Rym: I mean, really, if you're eating at a place like, I don't know, the hibachi at the Necco, we go to where everything pretty much costs the same.

1225
01:04:19,824 --> 01:04:19,964
Rym: Yeah.

1226
01:04:20,005 --> 01:04:20,870
Rym: Everyone throws in 20 bucks.

1227
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:21,192
Rym: You're good.

1228
01:04:21,997 --> 01:04:23,687
Rym: Don't let everyone just split the checkup.

1229
01:04:24,009 --> 01:04:24,511
Scott: It works.

1230
01:04:24,572 --> 01:04:31,589
Scott: it like a family style place, too, because everyone is all sharing every everyone's eating everything, you know, but don't pull.

1231
01:04:31,629 --> 01:04:32,815
Rym: Don't let people do that.

1232
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:34,925
Rym: If you're going to order the tap water.

1233
01:04:35,247 --> 01:04:35,589
Scott: Right.

1234
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:37,700
Scott: You know, I mean, think about this, right?

1235
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,168
Scott: If we go to a steakhouse, right.

1236
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:40,897
Scott: I order a 20 dollar steak.

1237
01:04:41,098 --> 01:04:42,304
Scott: Rym orders a 20 dollar steak.

1238
01:04:42,344 --> 01:04:42,666
Scott: All right.

1239
01:04:43,168 --> 01:04:44,092
Scott: I get a tap water.

1240
01:04:44,454 --> 01:04:46,503
Scott: Rym gets a 30 dollar bottle of wine.

1241
01:04:46,543 --> 01:04:48,189
Scott: Well, splitting that evenly.

1242
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,237
Scott: Not bad, really.

1243
01:04:50,698 --> 01:04:56,063
Scott: Even if I got a 10 dollar appetizer and we shake, he ate one third and I ate two thirds of it.

1244
01:04:56,666 --> 01:04:59,440
Scott: Really unfair to split the bill evenly.

1245
01:05:01,702 --> 01:05:04,417
Rym: Now, I don't know what to do about the shorting people.

1246
01:05:04,457 --> 01:05:11,583
Rym: in the long run, though, and if you confront him or what, because it's not going to be that long until we'd like kind of mathematically prove who is shorting our bill.

1247
01:05:11,864 --> 01:05:12,992
Scott: Yeah, it's all right.

1248
01:05:13,414 --> 01:05:16,780
Rym: I don't think any of them are going to listen to the show anytime soon and everyone's coming out this weekend.

1249
01:05:16,941 --> 01:05:21,399
Rym: So if they don't listen, then maybe I can engineer the final test.

1250
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:23,188
Rym: I need to figure out exactly who it is.

1251
01:05:23,933 --> 01:05:28,174
Scott: Maybe we should do is just go around the table and get the money from the people one at a time.

1252
01:05:28,194 --> 01:05:32,114
Scott: And then, you know, just be like, OK, Scott, give me your money.

1253
01:05:32,335 --> 01:05:33,944
Scott: OK, other Scott, give me your money.

1254
01:05:33,964 --> 01:05:36,177
Scott: OK, you know, Emily, give me your money.

1255
01:05:36,217 --> 01:05:40,325
Scott: And then you'd be like, you know, and then if someone gives you their money, that's not enough.

1256
01:05:41,551 --> 01:05:44,309
Rym: And that'll be that you got to know what everyone orders and how much it costs.

1257
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:48,558
Scott: Well, if you're you're going to do the credit card thing and you just get, you know, you get the bill.

1258
01:05:48,578 --> 01:05:50,352
Rym: No, then you can't do it based on the bill.

1259
01:05:50,372 --> 01:05:59,764
Rym: That's why I said you have to note it before you give the menu away, because when you get the bill, it's going to say like chicken parm for and then the price will be that times four.

1260
01:06:00,106 --> 01:06:00,408
Scott: Yeah.

1261
01:06:00,469 --> 01:06:01,999
Rym: And you're going to have to do a little bit more math.

1262
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:02,583
Scott: That's right.

1263
01:06:02,604 --> 01:06:03,512
Scott: You get a little calculator.

1264
01:06:03,613 --> 01:06:04,903
Rym: Plus, people don't remember what they order.

1265
01:06:06,231 --> 01:06:10,372
Rym: You know, often someone will come up to the table and be like, here's the shrimp, whatever.

1266
01:06:10,553 --> 01:06:13,146
Rym: And no one claims it because no one remembers what they ordered.

1267
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:15,960
Scott: I remember what I ordered anyway.

1268
01:06:16,842 --> 01:06:17,083
Scott: Oh, yeah.

1269
01:06:17,103 --> 01:06:27,543
Scott: The other thing is, you know, if you're finished eating and you want to leave because this happens to us a lot and they didn't bring you the check yet, like get someone's attention ASAP to get that check.

1270
01:06:27,604 --> 01:06:28,290
Scott: Otherwise you're going to be.

1271
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:29,461
Scott: you could be sitting there for a while.

1272
01:06:29,521 --> 01:06:30,808
Rym: No one better way.

1273
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:33,625
Rym: As soon as you get your food, ask for the check immediately.

1274
01:06:33,685 --> 01:06:39,443
Scott: Well, if you know that you're going to be in a rush to get out of there, even like let's say you have a train to catch or a meeting.

1275
01:06:39,764 --> 01:06:40,026
Scott: Right.

1276
01:06:40,307 --> 01:06:43,284
Scott: Ask for the check as soon as you sit down or right after you order.

1277
01:06:43,546 --> 01:06:46,811
Scott: That way, as soon as you finish eating, you can get up and leave because you have the check already.

1278
01:06:46,871 --> 01:06:47,356
Rym: It's weird.

1279
01:06:47,376 --> 01:06:49,171
Rym: Like lately and it seems like it's getting worse.

1280
01:06:49,292 --> 01:06:49,796
Rym: I don't know why.

1281
01:06:49,856 --> 01:06:51,489
Rym: Maybe because people aren't eating out as much.

1282
01:06:51,529 --> 01:06:53,484
Rym: The restaurants want people to be in there longer.

1283
01:06:53,504 --> 01:06:54,491
Rym: So it looks like it's full.

1284
01:06:54,813 --> 01:06:56,242
Rym: Maybe the Lord of dessert, all that stuff.

1285
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:58,956
Rym: But restaurants just don't bring me the check.

1286
01:06:59,297 --> 01:07:02,020
Rym: I've sat in places for like a half hour just trying to get anyone's attention.

1287
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,459
Scott: I think it's also because we eat quickly than more quickly than average.

1288
01:07:05,161 --> 01:07:06,732
Scott: Maybe especially when there's fewer of us.

1289
01:07:06,953 --> 01:07:07,175
Rym: Yeah.

1290
01:07:07,215 --> 01:07:10,678
Scott: But when the crew when there's more people, the check seems to come at the right time.

1291
01:07:10,718 --> 01:07:12,775
Rym: The crew together will be in a restaurant for like two hours.

1292
01:07:12,815 --> 01:07:13,037
Rym: Yeah.

1293
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:16,321
Scott: But when there's fewer people, we always end up waiting for the check as we eat quickly.

1294
01:07:16,602 --> 01:07:17,626
Scott: Right.

1295
01:07:18,028 --> 01:07:22,886
Scott: And then, you know, pay and then, you know, play the not it game to see who has to go up and pay.

1296
01:07:22,906 --> 01:07:23,468
Scott: Yeah.

1297
01:07:24,653 --> 01:07:29,539
Rym: If you want to get a trick I've always found where Peter and out here, I got almost nothing left.

1298
01:07:29,761 --> 01:07:29,982
Scott: Yeah.

1299
01:07:30,143 --> 01:07:37,707
Rym: Offer to pay with your credit card if you know that no one in your group will short and you will always end up with a surplus, even if you pay more than you need to pay.

1300
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:38,391
Scott: That's right.

1301
01:07:38,994 --> 01:07:41,748
Rym: However, if people are shorting, not so much.

1302
01:07:41,969 --> 01:07:50,523
Scott: No, but yeah, if you, if you got a whole bunch of people who are paying the right amount or over, you know, pay with your credit card and you'll get a profit when you collect the cash from everyone else.

1303
01:07:50,987 --> 01:07:52,377
Rym: I think we're really Peter and out here.

1304
01:07:52,457 --> 01:07:52,598
Scott: Yeah.

1305
01:07:52,619 --> 01:07:53,142
Scott: I think we're done.

1306
01:07:53,384 --> 01:07:54,089
Rym: I had almost nothing.

1307
01:07:54,129 --> 01:07:55,680
Scott: That's how to eat at a restaurant.

1308
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:56,961
Scott: The GeekNights away.

1309
01:08:04,548 --> 01:08:06,650
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1310
01:08:06,831 --> 01:08:09,289
