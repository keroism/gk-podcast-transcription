00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,319
Rym: It's Wednesday, May 15th, 2019.

2
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:12,483
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,523 --> 00:00:17,348
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight fruits basket cuz it's back.

4
00:00:18,392 --> 00:00:26,416
Rym: Let's do this So after like five days of hell weather, otherwise known as Seattle weather.

5
00:00:26,436 --> 00:00:27,620
Rym: It's actually nice out again.

6
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:29,230
Rym: I like to work for today.

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,760
Scott: Yeah, I biked Home from work kind of because I had to go get a bike and then bike it to here.

8
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,788
Rym: I gotta say though your new bike looking pretty good.

9
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:40,038
Scott: Well, the other bike was all broken.

10
00:00:40,058 --> 00:00:42,974
Scott: Oh, yeah And he didn't want to spend L talk about that on the show.

11
00:00:42,994 --> 00:00:45,025
Rym: Oh Yeah, we talked about that.

12
00:00:45,105 --> 00:00:45,969
Rym: What was broken on it?

13
00:00:46,029 --> 00:00:48,200
Rym: Yeah, it's about $100 worth of unbreaking.

14
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:58,476
Scott: Yeah, we're not worth ten year old cheap bike to fix yeah, but for someone else it probably is because to them It'll be a new bike that only costs almost nothing.

15
00:00:58,597 --> 00:01:04,900
Rym: Yep Meanwhile, I gotta replace the cassette the chain the rear wheel and some other stuff on my bike.

16
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:06,126
Scott: Just get the bike I have.

17
00:01:06,307 --> 00:01:08,500
Scott: you can get it in white and make it look dirty like the one you have.

18
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:10,520
Rym: No, the thing is my bike is way light.

19
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:17,588
Rym: It's basically it's a. it's as close to a road bike as you can get while still having a terrible hybrid Confirmation.

20
00:01:17,608 --> 00:01:18,940
Scott: I just know you should go pick up this bike.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,800
Scott: That is actually a hundred percent made of steel and you'll be surprised really that bikes hundred percent steel.

22
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:28,233
Rym: My frame is 100% steel cuz mine the frame is aluminum.

23
00:01:28,674 --> 00:01:31,866
Scott: and then yeah, aluminum is uncomfortable as fuck Yeah, but it's lighter.

24
00:01:32,288 --> 00:01:33,414
Rym: Uh-huh lighter and faster.

25
00:01:33,575 --> 00:01:37,120
Scott: go pick up that steel frame those fat tires.

26
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,145
Rym: Comfy is real comfy.

27
00:01:39,707 --> 00:01:40,973
Scott: steel is also real comfy.

28
00:01:41,113 --> 00:01:42,660
Rym: Yeah, my hybrid has road bike tires.

29
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:46,494
Rym: Well, the front is a road bike tire and the back is a slightly fatter tire.

30
00:01:46,534 --> 00:01:48,863
Rym: because as much as I'm like pop up Up go go go.

31
00:01:49,365 --> 00:01:52,680
Rym: the fatter tire on my rear butt was uh was the right one.

32
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,058
Scott: I have a hundred percent carbon road bike, so I don't need.

33
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:01,339
Rym: Yeah, see the problem is aluminum is way lighter and it's real strong, but it is stiff.

34
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:08,538
Rym: So and if you roll over like the tiniest little pebble that goes straight into the butt bone, yep, like boop.

35
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:12,532
Rym: Yep So yeah, guess we'll get right into it.

36
00:02:12,693 --> 00:02:16,535
Scott: on anime day I feel like I had another opening bit, but I can't remember what it was right now.

37
00:02:16,555 --> 00:02:18,749
Rym: You even said like oh, yeah I got some opening stuff to talk about.

38
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:19,655
Rym: I forget whatever.

39
00:02:19,675 --> 00:02:27,920
Rym: All right whoop, I Didn't have any audio going to the stream because I forgot to turn on the compressor because there's an analog pipeline going there.

40
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:28,998
Rym: So now there will be audio.

41
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,924
Scott: Excellent, yes, sir guys.

42
00:02:31,245 --> 00:02:32,570
Rym: Anyway got any news.

43
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:34,235
Scott: Do I have a news?

44
00:02:34,315 --> 00:02:41,920
Scott: It's not really a news It's more of like a fat an information that was discovered and is quite fascinating, right?

45
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,279
Scott: So Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles the American TV show from I don't know did it start in the late 80s or was just early 90s.

46
00:02:49,463 --> 00:02:55,956
Rym: I want to say it was late 80s But kid because I remember the era when I was really into TMNT exact year.

47
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,180
Scott: It started was definitely in that zone.

48
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:06,810
Scott: Anyway, so the very the pilot episode was like a five-part like epic kind of thing That I remember being worth watching even for an adult.

49
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,239
Scott: Of course, that's kid brain remembering with adult analyzation.

50
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:22,295
Scott: regardless there was an interview with one of the writers for that pilot and He said yeah, you know the usually when they would you know, all the comic was 1984.

51
00:03:22,295 --> 00:03:32,039
Scott: Well, I know that yeah, but the Usually a lot of those shows from that era like a Thundercats not not Not Voltron.

52
00:03:32,482 --> 00:03:35,420
Scott: Voltron in all right Voltron was originally go lion, right?

53
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,240
Scott: So it wasn't Voltron but you know the the ones that were clearly American shows like Thundercats and Ninja Turtles.

54
00:03:42,043 --> 00:03:46,660
Scott: But they were animated by Japanese studios because they outsourced it right the animation to them.

55
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,055
Scott: But the writing and all the other stuff was done in the US, right?

56
00:03:50,095 --> 00:03:51,120
Scott: So still an American show.

57
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:53,780
Scott: They just didn't use American animators, right?

58
00:03:54,322 --> 00:03:55,587
Scott: So Ninja Turtles is one of those.

59
00:03:55,667 --> 00:04:00,127
Scott: Toei animated it and usually when this happened because you know It was for TV.

60
00:04:00,147 --> 00:04:02,140
Scott: It was a lot a lot of episodes.

61
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,227
Scott: It was for syndication the.

62
00:04:04,508 --> 00:04:07,840
Scott: they wouldn't put the a-team and the Japanese studio, right?

63
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,140
Scott: They wouldn't have the same people who are animating like what was a really big anime like from the early 90s like utenna.

64
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:15,023
Scott: Yeah, right.

65
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:20,839
Scott: They wouldn't have the not that that was that animated that well, well, it was animated really well considering its budget.

66
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:28,120
Scott: Yeah, but the point is they wouldn't put the people animating that who get the best animators on the American Ninja Turtle show.

67
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,288
Scott: They put the B team on it.

68
00:04:29,429 --> 00:04:58,419
Scott: Yeah, apparently for some reason According to this interview with the writer the only the pilot episodes the five episode You know series of the Ninja Turtles cartoon was animated by the a-team at Toei and he could not remember The animators name the director of it, but he remembered that the person moved to LA In the early 2000s, they went to dinner with them and that the person directed a bunch of Sailor Moon after season.

69
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,798
Scott: one description only describe one infamous person Kuri.

70
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:17,540
Scott: Now I really want to go back and see how many naked cars y'all are in the first five episodes of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

71
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:24,980
Rym: It's kind of like when you go back and watch the pilot of B Taz and you're like wait This just looks like anime like hundred percent.

72
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,118
Scott: Big O and Batman both start with B.

73
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:34,540
Rym: This is kind of crazy actually just like it's interesting.

74
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:41,446
Scott: It's like a fascinating trivia that no one knew except this one guy and now everyone who cares knows Which is almost nobody.

75
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:49,105
Rym: What's funny is I imagine this one guy is one of those situations where they're like, oh, yeah I worked with this guy once and they don't really quite Realize that.

76
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:56,358
Rym: to a limited number of people in the rest of the world The name of that person is a really goddamn big deal and no end is one nut job.

77
00:05:56,599 --> 00:06:00,777
Rym: Yeah We got to watch the kappa show so we can talk about it.

78
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,928
Rym: Oh I watched a little bit.

79
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:06,114
Scott: Are you hold on to your butt?

80
00:06:06,194 --> 00:06:08,200
Rym: Hold on to your butts literally?

81
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:14,240
Rym: Allegorically literally and literally in a different way because it's Ikuhara.

82
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:21,960
Rym: The butts are also cars and the prostate is an adolescent's metaphor and also literally the prostate.

83
00:06:23,502 --> 00:06:31,914
Rym: So in some other news if you might have not noticed Pokemon detective Pikachu did come out and the initial reviews from the people I would trust.

84
00:06:31,994 --> 00:06:39,153
Rym: I saw the trailer when the trailer was before Something yeah, it looked like it had a potential to be really good.

85
00:06:39,173 --> 00:06:55,184
Scott: I go to the theater for the head the trailer for this Whatever I saw in the theater before us, but uh, oh I think it was one that we went to see like either Night Night on the what.

86
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:58,014
Scott: no no no no no night is long walk on girl.

87
00:06:58,135 --> 00:06:58,897
Scott: one of the one of the.

88
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:01,915
Rym: I don't think it Was that it was what was the only other one we saw.

89
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:05,839
Rym: that wasn't as good I mean, we just went and saw some other anime.

90
00:07:07,443 --> 00:07:08,048
Rym: You don't remember.

91
00:07:08,068 --> 00:07:09,098
Rym: Well, that doesn't matter.

92
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:27,666
Rym: anyway, the trailer look good and while some people Weirdly don't like the direction that this franchise was gonna go I was really into it and our friends who like Pokemon to the appropriate level of liking Pokemon have said that it is in fact Fantastic and definitely worth watching.

93
00:07:27,787 --> 00:07:33,826
Scott: I mean the trailer seemed like it wasn't one of those trailers where I went like And it wasn't like.

94
00:07:34,407 --> 00:07:38,400
Scott: by the way my reaction to most trailers is yeah, and it wasn't like Sonic.

95
00:07:40,121 --> 00:07:42,229
Scott: My reaction to the trailer was like huh?

96
00:07:42,631 --> 00:07:43,555
Scott: I see what you did there.

97
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:44,860
Scott: Maybe I'll watch it on Netflix.

98
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:47,100
Scott: Yeah, and that's I guess still my reaction.

99
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:48,162
Rym: Like.

100
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:52,057
Rym: I don't know if I'll go bother going to see in the theater, but I will definitely see it.

101
00:07:52,077 --> 00:07:56,902
Scott: to be honest I was considering going to the theater to see it during all these rainy days We had.

102
00:07:56,922 --> 00:08:00,700
Scott: yeah, the main deterrent was nothing about the movie itself.

103
00:08:01,283 --> 00:08:04,820
Scott: It was simply that I knew if I went to the theater, it would be full of annoying kids.

104
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:06,867
Scott: Yeah, true if I could.

105
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:12,630
Rym: that's why I feel like I'm gonna see it in the theater After like near the end of the run.

106
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:18,337
Scott: if I knew that going to the theater There would only be 30 year old nerds there who had played Pokemon in the 90s.

107
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:21,415
Scott: Then I would have just gone probably on one of those rainy days.

108
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:24,328
Rym: all I want to say I'm gonna read a quote from Wikipedia because it did.

109
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:28,224
Rym: this is why I want to see the movie quote Tim and Pikachu Interrogated mr.

110
00:08:28,265 --> 00:08:31,480
Rym: Mime who directs them to an illegal underground fighting arena.

111
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:32,623
Rym: That is all.

112
00:08:32,643 --> 00:08:36,500
Rym: that is the kind of sentence that I want to hear before I go see a movie like that.

113
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,712
Scott: I mean also I got to say the fact that forget the Pokemon part.

114
00:08:39,773 --> 00:08:39,933
Scott: right.

115
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:48,130
Scott: the fact that it is a live-action Animation combination plus detective story Yeah Roger is one of the greatest movies ever feels like it's.

116
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:53,770
Scott: it's like at least 50% of this movie is just Roger rabbit homage Where the Pokemon skin on it instead.

117
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,663
Rym: Roger rabbit I could watch any time You could like.

118
00:08:56,723 --> 00:09:02,323
Scott: they could have just taken some script from Roger rabbit to replace all the characters of the Pokemon and you wouldn't even Fucking know.

119
00:09:02,565 --> 00:09:04,619
Rym: Yep, and you know what I'd be fine with that, right?

120
00:09:05,181 --> 00:09:14,199
Scott: I guess it's I have not having seen the movie But I mean definitely it seems like there's too many major factors in common for it to be merely coincidence Yep.

121
00:09:14,883 --> 00:09:18,619
Rym: So in another news you may have seen this and I really got it.

122
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,960
Rym: It's related to animation because it seems like the instigating incident was specifically the Adobe animate software.

123
00:09:26,462 --> 00:09:26,984
Rym: So you might have.

124
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:28,631
Scott: I thought it's just Photoshop.

125
00:09:28,752 --> 00:09:30,540
Rym: people's know those two separate things.

126
00:09:31,202 --> 00:09:36,340
Rym: The people the Photoshop people are mad that the price to subscribe to just Photoshop went up.

127
00:09:36,681 --> 00:09:41,740
Scott: So the lowest price was the for the photo package which includes only Lightroom and Photoshop, but nothing else.

128
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,928
Scott: Yeah, and what I read it could be wrong But what I read is that the price didn't actually go up.

129
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:54,500
Scott: just the storage on the default package was increased So that if you go to the website It'll say $20 a month instead of 10.

130
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:00,960
Scott: Yeah, but you could still have the option of choosing less cloud storage and still get it for the old price.

131
00:10:01,361 --> 00:10:02,646
Scott: Yeah, is that true or not true?

132
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:04,714
Rym: I'm not sure because why would I?

133
00:10:04,794 --> 00:10:05,898
Rym: why would anyone pay for?

134
00:10:06,681 --> 00:10:07,446
Rym: Just Photoshop?

135
00:10:07,486 --> 00:10:15,179
Scott: when for a little bit more money you get the entire Adobe world I still I mean a hundred, you know If you're paying for just Photoshop and Lightroom because all you do is photos you don't true?

136
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,460
Scott: The only reason I actually pay the 50 instead of the 20 is cuz I use Premiere.

137
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:20,853
Scott: Yeah, I never made a video.

138
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:25,473
Scott: I would pay the 20 I use because I use Lightroom the most and Photoshop the second most.

139
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:26,777
Scott: I use the third most.

140
00:10:26,837 --> 00:10:29,806
Scott: I use regularly Adobe Media Encoder awesome.

141
00:10:30,027 --> 00:10:34,760
Rym: I use Photoshop Lightroom Premiere After Effects InDesign Adobe PDF.

142
00:10:35,822 --> 00:10:37,712
Scott: I'll use the mobile stuff in the cloud storage.

143
00:10:37,934 --> 00:10:38,115
Scott: Yes.

144
00:10:38,135 --> 00:10:41,711
Scott: I have an iPad Pro So there's a lot of stuff I can do there, but I did so.

145
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:45,084
Rym: yeah, there may be a misunderstanding there But this one's even funnier.

146
00:10:45,164 --> 00:10:49,660
Rym: So the story going around is that Adobe is threatening to sue you.

147
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:52,098
Scott: This is a separate simultaneous story.

148
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:59,293
Rym: Yes But this is the one that's making the most rounds that people are the most mad about and people Clearly did not fucking read this article.

149
00:10:59,454 --> 00:11:00,840
Rym: Yeah, any of the articles about it?

150
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:06,358
Rym: The story is Adobe's going around threatening to sue you if you run the old versions of the software.

151
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:06,900
Scott: not true?

152
00:11:07,241 --> 00:11:09,170
Scott: Yeah, so one is there a Snopes?

153
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:09,874
Scott: It's like not true.

154
00:11:10,055 --> 00:11:12,567
Rym: No, so here's the deal There.

155
00:11:12,788 --> 00:11:14,235
Rym: this has nothing to do with.

156
00:11:14,335 --> 00:11:20,700
Rym: if you licensed Pre-creative cloud software like I have a license to cs4 like production premium.

157
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,495
Rym: I can fucking install that on computers if I want to.

158
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:31,133
Rym: that's totally fine Mm-hmm, if you have the old software that you licensed in fact I have a bunch of audition licenses - you can just use it.

159
00:11:31,434 --> 00:11:31,615
Scott: Yep.

160
00:11:31,695 --> 00:11:32,860
Rym: That's the old shitty soft.

161
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,756
Scott: I actually have an Adobe Premiere Elements license from the early 2000s.

162
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:44,420
Rym: You know, I have the CD-ROM somewhere - Premiere Elements is the kind of thing you would punish someone with by forcing them to use it.

163
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,729
Scott: Yeah, I didn't make too many videos with it.

164
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,200
Rym: Premiere Elements was such a good thing.

165
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,854
Scott: It was cheap because otherwise I would regret buying unusable garbage.

166
00:11:50,994 --> 00:11:51,557
Scott: It was bad.

167
00:11:51,617 --> 00:11:53,867
Scott: Even when it was new I bought it when it was brand new.

168
00:11:54,068 --> 00:11:54,831
Rym: that is not true.

169
00:11:54,912 --> 00:11:56,660
Rym: You can continue to use your old software.

170
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:09,995
Rym: This only applies to creative cloud Adobe software and the deal is Adobe will force you to use and has for a long time Either the current version of whatever software like.

171
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:15,500
Rym: if you're on Photoshop You can either have the current version running or the previous version running.

172
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,573
Scott: Yeah, a lot of times for like when Adobe releases new creative cloud versions.

173
00:12:19,954 --> 00:12:28,749
Scott: sometimes when I open up creative cloud It's just like yeah updating Lightroom now, but sometimes it'll be like Lightroom CC 2018 and guess what?

174
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,785
Scott: Here's Lightroom CC 2019 with an install button next to it And your options are either.

175
00:12:32,805 --> 00:12:35,096
Scott: Right, so you can switch but 2017 will be gone, right?

176
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:43,116
Scott: And then you install 2019 and switch over eventually at some point and then at some point 2018 goes away and the 2020 shows up.

177
00:12:43,478 --> 00:12:46,775
Scott: and you know Sometimes they do it like that to where you could because it's such a big upgrade.

178
00:12:46,795 --> 00:12:50,110
Scott: you switch on your own Yeah, and sometimes it just updates like Chrome updates.

179
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:50,753
Scott: You don't even notice.

180
00:12:51,054 --> 00:12:51,235
Rym: Yep.

181
00:12:51,677 --> 00:12:54,658
Rym: So that's fine like that's really reasonable and that's what I would expect.

182
00:12:54,678 --> 00:13:07,077
Rym: a Bunch of people who for probably dumb reasons want to use Really old versions of creative cloud software have been like not letting the software update.

183
00:13:07,258 --> 00:13:08,080
Rym: So they're various means.

184
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,580
Scott: Right, so they're paying the monthly cost, but they're just using like but they're never clicking the update button.

185
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:19,520
Scott: They're just keeping the version that they have of whatever it is and never clicking on the free update that they're paying for.

186
00:13:19,947 --> 00:13:23,275
Scott: Not only Neglecting to get new features, right?

187
00:13:23,496 --> 00:13:23,879
Scott: They're all.

188
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:24,120
Scott: I mean.

189
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,013
Scott: They're probably mostly concerned about the user interface changing which it will probably.

190
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:29,920
Scott: yeah, right and think other things like that.

191
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:41,582
Scott: But they're also neglecting to get new features and neglecting to get new bug fixes and neglecting to get new Security updates that they are paying for and would get effectively for free just by clicking Okay,

192
00:13:41,802 --> 00:13:42,364
Rym: because

193
00:13:42,384 --> 00:13:47,960
Scott: I guess most of my assumption is they don't want the user interface to change slightly in some way and I've learned something.

194
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:58,542
Rym: So Yes, they're not like changing the things that everyone thinks they're changing and - they're not threatening to sue anyone for using the old Versions.

195
00:13:58,823 --> 00:13:59,023
Rym: they're.

196
00:13:59,123 --> 00:14:05,885
Rym: all they did is send an email out saying look you're using like animate 15 Which is from like 2015.

197
00:14:05,885 --> 00:14:06,407
Rym: Mm-hmm.

198
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:10,484
Rym: So anime now is not like version 19.

199
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:11,350
Rym: So these are people.

200
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,840
Scott: so animate used to be flash by the way.

201
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:28,100
Rym: Yes, so and these people are using animate 15 or animate 16 from a long-ass time ago and Dolby is apparently suing Adobe because of some licensing issue where Dolby thinks Adobe isn't paying their fair share.

202
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:33,677
Rym: So Adobe in response one just remove that shit from newer versions of their software.

203
00:14:33,697 --> 00:14:40,619
Rym: So it won't be a problem Yeah, and two they warned all the people using this old software refusing to update that.

204
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:46,680
Rym: yo Technically Adobe could sue you for using this software because of a licensing dispute.

205
00:14:47,881 --> 00:14:50,670
Rym: You should upgrade to the current version of animate.

206
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,154
Rym: We will help you do it.

207
00:14:52,174 --> 00:14:53,097
Rym: It's free.

208
00:14:53,137 --> 00:14:53,539
Scott: Just click.

209
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:59,200
Scott: Okay It's young sitting there in your system tray yelling at you probably for four years and you just never clicked.

210
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,828
Scott: Okay, or you turn it off somehow.

211
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:05,053
Rym: Yeah, but even the bottom is like if you have any difficulties Adobe's customer support is here to answer.

212
00:15:05,073 --> 00:15:06,040
Scott: you're paying for it.

213
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,435
Scott: It's like people hate the subscription service.

214
00:15:08,496 --> 00:15:09,200
Scott: that deal right?

215
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,460
Scott: But look you get what you pay for if you pay 50 bucks a month.

216
00:15:12,941 --> 00:15:14,507
Scott: You get real customer service.

217
00:15:14,527 --> 00:15:14,948
Scott: you get free.

218
00:15:14,968 --> 00:15:19,660
Scott: you get all this shit when you pay that that you don't get when you pay a flat thousand dollars.

219
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:26,040
Rym: So the story of Adobe is threatening to sue me for using my old software that I paid for is complete bullshit.

220
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:41,500
Rym: The actual story is a handful of specific Adobe applications Put you in danger of being sued by Dolby Unless you upgrade to a version that doesn't have this problem and Adobe is bending over backwards to help you do this.

221
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:42,703
Rym: So you don't get fucked.

222
00:15:42,723 --> 00:15:43,365
Scott: Mm-hmm.

223
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:46,333
Rym: It's not even every creative cloud software.

224
00:15:46,474 --> 00:15:48,760
Scott: Yeah, so I mean this just goes back to the point.

225
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,560
Scott: I mean assuming that the people are mad because they don't want user interface changes, which one is dumb, too.

226
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:57,380
Rym: Those people did not even read this email, right?

227
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:07,997
Scott: But the thing is it just goes back to the point I always make and that for some reason a lot of people Would rather do immense amounts of work and labor than learn.

228
00:16:08,921 --> 00:16:15,040
Rym: You know hard it would be to be for me to prevent audition from updating as opposed to just using it when it updates.

229
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:21,280
Scott: It's like people would rather copy and paste something a hundred times then learn a regular expression, right people would.

230
00:16:22,088 --> 00:16:23,320
Rym: They say about regular expression.

231
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:37,180
Scott: I know people would rather create no JS than have to learn a different language other than JavaScript, right people would rather Do tons and tons of work to make sure this old ass Photoshop keeps running on their new computer.

232
00:16:37,742 --> 00:16:43,900
Scott: Then just learn the user interface changes or shortcut changes in the newer better vastly superior Photoshop with this new features.

233
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,972
Scott: Alright, it's like I see this happen over and over and over again.

234
00:16:49,012 --> 00:16:50,836
Scott: people just for some reason.

235
00:16:51,157 --> 00:16:59,612
Scott: the human brain and a lot Of people not all people cuz not me It's just so averse to like education and learning.

236
00:16:59,632 --> 00:17:01,558
Scott: it just doesn't want to have to learn it.

237
00:17:01,598 --> 00:17:04,528
Scott: it just views Learning even the smallest thing.

238
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:07,480
Scott: I don't want to learn how to switch gears on my bike.

239
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:10,859
Scott: I'd rather stomp on this heavy gear all the way up the hill, right?

240
00:17:11,921 --> 00:17:17,079
Scott: Why is some human brains so averse to learning that they measure?

241
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:25,160
Scott: somehow the effort of learning even a small thing or putting any thought into something as greater than This immense amount of labor?

242
00:17:26,326 --> 00:17:26,928
Scott: how this happened?

243
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:34,174
Rym: one of the issues that play might be that Newer versions of software don't work that well on Windows 7 and these are the same.

244
00:17:34,214 --> 00:17:36,501
Rym: people are still running Windows 7.

245
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:38,488
Rym: I well, which again same problem.

246
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:41,418
Scott: I think Microsoft does still support Windows 7 to some degree.

247
00:17:41,438 --> 00:17:43,326
Rym: It's not dead Yeah, but no one else does.

248
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:45,475
Rym: Windows 7 don't run Windows 7.

249
00:17:45,475 --> 00:17:47,082
Rym: Of course, it's 2019.

250
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:49,250
Rym: Of course now Windows 7 is ancient.

251
00:17:49,592 --> 00:17:51,560
Scott: Well, I'd be better to run Windows 7 than in those eight.

252
00:17:52,282 --> 00:17:54,087
Rym: Yeah, Windows 8 was a mistake.

253
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:56,734
Scott: we all agree just like Windows seems to get it wrong.

254
00:17:56,795 --> 00:18:02,093
Scott: every other deal right Windows 98 Windows me Windows 2000.

255
00:18:02,093 --> 00:18:03,480
Scott: I guess Windows XP was okay.

256
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:07,592
Rym: Okay, when I was 2000, I remember when it was 2000 came out.

257
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:12,764
Scott: I thought it was Windows Vista and then it was Good after that.

258
00:18:13,186 --> 00:18:13,728
Scott: I went out.

259
00:18:13,768 --> 00:18:16,920
Rym: I remember hot windows 2000 because it was that good.

260
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,400
Rym: I was like, I'm fucking buying this new operating system.

261
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,750
Rym: Yeah, cuz I was previously running Windows 95.

262
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,602
Rym: Yeah, I didn't even have 98.

263
00:18:24,602 --> 00:18:28,820
Scott: I think I bought Vista ultimate which wasn't as bad as they said.

264
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:29,804
Scott: Yeah, it wasn't.

265
00:18:29,824 --> 00:18:31,872
Scott: it wasn't me or eight bad.

266
00:18:31,973 --> 00:18:33,760
Rym: But guys Windows 10 is great.

267
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:40,312
Scott: Fine You just gotta remove all the garbage which is still removable.

268
00:18:40,473 --> 00:18:41,536
Scott: Yeah, if it wasn't removable.

269
00:18:41,597 --> 00:18:42,780
Scott: I wouldn't use Windows 10.

270
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,550
Rym: Yeah, but what would you use Linux on the desktop?

271
00:18:46,031 --> 00:18:48,540
Scott: I have the WSL to which we talked about on Monday.

272
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:50,172
Rym: Yeah, but then how you gonna play any game?

273
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:51,557
Rym: Oh man.

274
00:18:53,245 --> 00:19:03,407
Rym: Anyway, anyway, it's time for Things of the day.

275
00:19:03,427 --> 00:19:06,278
Rym: So you probably saw some art on Twitter a while ago.

276
00:19:06,338 --> 00:19:12,826
Rym: That was like Creepypasta or like horror interpretations of Garfield.

277
00:19:12,846 --> 00:19:25,454
Scott: I've seen lots and lots of remixes of Garfield and it's I just still continue to find it fascinating that Garfield is like in this weird unique space separate from all other like.

278
00:19:25,474 --> 00:19:26,577
Scott: there's nothing else like it.

279
00:19:26,617 --> 00:19:28,522
Scott: where it is it is Some people.

280
00:19:28,603 --> 00:19:29,587
Scott: it is reviled.

281
00:19:30,048 --> 00:19:39,996
Scott: It's unfunny, but it is funny, but it's funny in this When it's remixed, it's like this amazing like masterpiece of art like Garfield.

282
00:19:40,016 --> 00:19:41,540
Rym: without Garfield abstract.

283
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:43,345
Rym: It's your field without our.

284
00:19:43,386 --> 00:19:45,954
Rym: Garfield is like a height of comic art.

285
00:19:46,455 --> 00:19:47,298
Scott: You know, it's Dali.

286
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:48,020
Scott: It's Picasso.

287
00:19:48,323 --> 00:19:49,737
Scott: it's like everything at once.

288
00:19:49,757 --> 00:19:55,260
Rym: and You know, it's our field is like this perfect deconstruction of late capitalism.

289
00:19:55,891 --> 00:19:56,339
Scott: I don't know.

290
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:03,460
Scott: It's just so much going on with Garfield that is not going on with literally any other comic ever.

291
00:20:03,721 --> 00:20:13,428
Scott: So what I'm gonna link you to like I swear to God one day We're gonna go to like the Met and there's gonna be Garfield just on the wall and we're gonna be like, yep And kids will be like what the hell is that?

292
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:16,060
Scott: and they'll be look at it the way we look at like Van Gogh or something.

293
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:25,604
Rym: Yup, so what I'm gonna link to you is probably the height of the expression of the remixing of Garfield that exists today And it is a.

294
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:29,460
Scott: I didn't see this before just now but I can see how elaborate this is.

295
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,612
Rym: This is a YouTube video that takes all this concept art of like.

296
00:20:34,194 --> 00:20:36,360
Rym: what if Garfield was a horror?

297
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:47,635
Rym: adventure game like five nights at Freddy's and or a horror movie like alien one and It turns it into a fake video game that is 13 minutes long.

298
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:54,520
Scott: that was that is on the Gameboy But the Gameboy has a 16 by 9 screen and shows more colors than just green but has the same range of colors.

299
00:20:54,982 --> 00:20:58,519
Rym: I cannot express what the fuck cuz normal works for the government.

300
00:20:59,282 --> 00:21:01,347
Rym: Arlene is being held captive in the basement.

301
00:21:01,548 --> 00:21:04,295
Rym: Okay, like keep your scent level that this is some.

302
00:21:04,956 --> 00:21:06,260
Rym: this is fucking amazing.

303
00:21:06,422 --> 00:21:13,876
Rym: This is So much like what any image from this YouTube video by itself would be like.

304
00:21:13,976 --> 00:21:14,678
Rym: enough for me.

305
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:17,085
Rym: this I cannot.

306
00:21:17,206 --> 00:21:18,511
Rym: this is up my alley.

307
00:21:18,872 --> 00:21:22,890
Scott: who made this and one touch 1.5 million views.

308
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:23,313
Scott: How is it?

309
00:21:23,353 --> 00:21:24,177
Scott: Not Neil Siseraig?

310
00:21:25,462 --> 00:21:26,204
Rym: This is very.

311
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:26,807
Rym: this is the.

312
00:21:26,987 --> 00:21:30,480
Rym: this is similar creative expression to Neil Siseraig.

313
00:21:30,601 --> 00:21:31,224
Scott: I don't think he's.

314
00:21:31,345 --> 00:21:33,194
Scott: Neil is like a great pixel art artist.

315
00:21:33,235 --> 00:21:34,039
Rym: those know Neil is.

316
00:21:34,702 --> 00:21:37,737
Scott: Neil has a Neil my son but he could but I would believe it if you told me.

317
00:21:37,757 --> 00:21:38,260
Scott: he wrote this.

318
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:38,559
Rym: You know what?

319
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,885
Rym: I would say I would believe it if someone said that we looked at Neil Siseraig his brain and he has the largest fusiform Gyrus anyone has ever found.

320
00:21:44,945 --> 00:21:46,690
Scott: the point is a lumpy touch.

321
00:21:47,191 --> 00:21:47,934
Scott: you are.

322
00:21:47,954 --> 00:21:52,468
Scott: if you can do one more great thing You will be elevated to an internet legend.

323
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:53,813
Rym: Yeah, this is too good.

324
00:21:54,134 --> 00:21:54,876
Scott: Maybe they will be.

325
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,622
Scott: touch has done something else great We don't know about.

326
00:21:56,642 --> 00:22:01,260
Rym: let me judge has got only lumpy touch only has a hundred and forty four thousand subscribers on YouTube.

327
00:22:01,381 --> 00:22:04,139
Rym: That's a lot but it's also a travesty.

328
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:06,364
Scott: That's quite a lot.

329
00:22:06,706 --> 00:22:08,012
Scott: I'm gonna subscribe to lumpy touch.

330
00:22:08,032 --> 00:22:14,506
Rym: Oh my god, like the first comment here is okay Honestly, when I saw this I thought you actually made a game I would play.

331
00:22:14,647 --> 00:22:19,353
Scott: I'd hire them to do the art for my game, dude I would hire them to make this into a game anyway.

332
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:20,419
Rym: Anyway, what do you got?

333
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,655
Scott: So here is a gentleman from the fine state of Tennessee.

334
00:22:24,735 --> 00:22:25,860
Rym: sounds like he's from Tennessee.

335
00:22:25,981 --> 00:22:30,300
Scott: If you don't know anybody if you don't know anything about the United States, Tennessee is not a fine state.

336
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,171
Scott: But well, Tennessee is kind of it's not the worst state.

337
00:22:33,332 --> 00:22:35,079
Scott: like Nashville is actually on the up.

338
00:22:35,508 --> 00:22:48,138
Rym: Yeah So like Alabama is probably Alabama and Mississippi are tied for the worst state because Mississippi sucks But Alabama just passed like just banned abortion like just now.

339
00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:50,846
Scott: Yeah Georgia's trying Georgia.

340
00:22:51,147 --> 00:22:52,574
Rym: Georgia's bad pretty much.

341
00:22:52,614 --> 00:23:12,452
Scott: if you you go to Florida right and you go to the bottom of the Florida and you go up and up and up and up and things get dark and About halfway through Florida then they get basically pitch black at the top of Florida right when you get to the northernmost part of Florida and then you just go north to the top of Georgia and West and draw a Big ol rectangle and that's like the place you don't want to go.

342
00:23:12,512 --> 00:23:18,817
Rym: weirdly though of all things South Carolina is doing better than North Carolina on a lot of things which is weird.

343
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:19,600
Scott: that is weird.

344
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,249
Scott: South Carolina has been way worse than North Carolina has been.

345
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,340
Rym: North Carolina's politics are way more corrupt and fucked up.

346
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:28,980
Rym: Anyway, anyway, Tennessee is like one of those states.

347
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,450
Rym: It's got a lot of good going on and a lot of bad.

348
00:23:31,591 --> 00:23:36,993
Scott: all the good happens to be is mostly going on in Nashville, yeah, which is like super a-plus upswing.

349
00:23:37,114 --> 00:23:38,640
Scott: also, I mean, it's not all positive.

350
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,812
Scott: It's a lot of gentrification going on there also bachelor parties.

351
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:51,759
Scott: Yeah, but Nashville is pretty great Relatively speaking as far as American cities go but rest of Tennessee, yeah, and here's it fine gentleman from Tennessee.

352
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:57,800
Scott: and This gentleman needed some work done on the tires on his vehicle because it's a place where you have to drive.

353
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:03,000
Scott: Yeah, I tend to see of course and you know, he finds out a place that's offering a free tire.

354
00:24:03,644 --> 00:24:08,834
Rym: So he calls, you know Todd discount tire I've been a discount tire and I've gotten a free tire from them.

355
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:11,270
Scott: calls him up and you know He says yeah, you know, so it's.

356
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,640
Scott: I guess it must be some kind of deal.

357
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:19,467
Scott: We're like buy three get one or something like that, you know Yeah, and he calls him and he says and they tell him like yeah, we're next to a Taco Bell We're on this road.

358
00:24:19,508 --> 00:24:39,013
Scott: So he goes he drives down the road he goes, you know, he finds finds the tire place and something happens there at the tire place next to the Taco Bell and This is this very fine vertical video with his phone Explaining the hullabaloo that happens at the discount tire next to the Taco Bell.

359
00:24:39,194 --> 00:24:44,390
Rym: Yep, the discount tire next to the Taco Bell This is this is pretty good.

360
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,460
Scott: This is this is a plus video.

361
00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:47,784
Rym: What really helps.

362
00:24:47,865 --> 00:24:49,149
Rym: is that his delit?

363
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:55,267
Rym: he sounds like a stand-up comedian like his delivery of Just his explanation of this situation.

364
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:57,573
Scott: He's definitely using stand-up comedian voice.

365
00:24:57,653 --> 00:25:01,223
Scott: Yeah, it's like a Seinfeld voice like The Tennessee accent.

366
00:25:07,484 --> 00:25:12,319
Rym: Can you explain to me sir y x and y?

367
00:25:13,174 --> 00:25:18,717
Rym: anyway In the meta moment GeekNights is a podcast and we do a bunch of stuff.

368
00:25:18,937 --> 00:25:23,260
Rym: if you go to our website You can find out things like did you know we're doing a book club in the book club?

369
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,448
Rym: We're reading the most painful book we have ever read pages of pain.

370
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:28,212
Scott: I just read some painful pages.

371
00:25:28,312 --> 00:25:30,298
Rym: I just I just met carfudd.

372
00:25:30,318 --> 00:25:33,167
Scott: I Just the demon I was.

373
00:25:33,307 --> 00:25:36,720
Scott: I just read a whole chapter about limbs getting chopped off flying every which way.

374
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,770
Rym: Yeah, then I forgot how many attached and reattached.

375
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,114
Rym: Ah, yeah the reattachment.

376
00:25:41,215 --> 00:25:42,780
Rym: I remember that explicitly.

377
00:25:43,061 --> 00:25:44,545
Scott: That's some fucked up biz.

378
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,233
Rym: the reattachment area is where this book the.

379
00:25:47,595 --> 00:25:49,380
Rym: what I can say is that it's really going on.

380
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,930
Scott: It was already off the rails now.

381
00:25:51,031 --> 00:25:52,400
Scott: It's like you can't even see the rails anymore.

382
00:25:52,440 --> 00:26:03,760
Rym: I think you can see though cuz I remember the thing that I remembered about this book the most is that most like Dungeons & Dragons branded novels are just here is a Dungeons & Dragons kind of story.

383
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:10,739
Scott: Now it's talking now about like exploding pustules and everyone's body and I'm like, whoa that hasn't been mentioned since chapter one.

384
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:18,184
Rym: Yep, so you take a typical shitty like Star Wars book and it's like a then B then C then D. This is a nerd fantasy book.

385
00:26:18,204 --> 00:26:19,267
Rym: That's kind of badly written.

386
00:26:19,668 --> 00:26:22,797
Rym: This book starts as like yeah typical fantasy book.

387
00:26:23,138 --> 00:26:28,617
Rym: a then B Then trippy shit then off the rails then it's just allegory.

388
00:26:28,657 --> 00:26:29,400
Rym: What even happened?

389
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:37,649
Rym: That is why I remember this book being different from all the other Dungeons & Dragons books because it turns into some surreal Nonsense at the end.

390
00:26:37,689 --> 00:26:39,520
Scott: his or it has been nonsense for a while.

391
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,527
Scott: It's just even more nonsense.

392
00:26:41,728 --> 00:26:43,494
Rym: I want to see this made into a movie.

393
00:26:44,577 --> 00:26:45,260
Scott: I don't think you could.

394
00:26:45,941 --> 00:26:48,116
Rym: It's kind of like trying to make a culture book into a movie.

395
00:26:48,136 --> 00:26:48,780
Rym: you read the beginning.

396
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,061
Scott: You're like.

397
00:26:49,122 --> 00:26:55,769
Scott: I can make a culture book in a movie as long as I pick the right one player of games and maybe Consider Phlebas are the only ones that could.

398
00:26:55,909 --> 00:26:56,912
Scott: you could even be the only ones.

399
00:26:56,953 --> 00:27:10,510
Scott: I've read any portion of those are the only ones where anyone Consider Phlebas you can have a sexy pirate and then you can make an angry earth Trilogy of movies with the same actor doing the sexy pirate Scott.

400
00:27:10,811 --> 00:27:14,460
Rym: if you if you ever read use of weapons or surface detail.

401
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:21,918
Rym: if You can't make a movie out of those you know who might be able to or might have been able to come out like Dune Movie Jodorowsky is the only one who could have made a movie like that.

402
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,284
Rym: Yeah, anyway.

403
00:27:24,846 --> 00:27:29,059
Rym: also gig nights has officially endorsed in the Democratic primary Elizabeth Warren.

404
00:27:29,219 --> 00:27:29,440
Rym: okay?

405
00:27:29,601 --> 00:27:31,297
Rym: Cuz she's the only one who has a plan.

406
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:48,360
Rym: Also because times are dire right now I just want to remind you because a Bunch of people are talking about how there is evidence that if an online community has an explicit Upfront like rules of engagement and terms like here is how you should use our community.

407
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,183
Rym: These are the rules.

408
00:27:49,724 --> 00:28:01,584
Rym: people actually do behave better and the gig nights forum has very good Rules about how our community functions and the rules basically boil down to no fucking Nazis Full stop.

409
00:28:01,604 --> 00:28:07,524
Rym: you cannot be a Nazi here, so if you want a Nazi free online social community That's chill.

410
00:28:07,966 --> 00:28:09,877
Rym: the gig nights forum is there and you should join it.

411
00:28:11,074 --> 00:28:25,185
Rym: so Fruits basket I gotta take you back to when I ran the RIT anime club from around 2001 to around 2005 because when we were at the RIT anime club an Anime came out.

412
00:28:25,225 --> 00:28:28,280
Rym: there was an adaptation of a manga and that anime was called fruits basket.

413
00:28:28,662 --> 00:28:32,678
Scott: So I knew first basket at the time was a a shoujo manga.

414
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:35,909
Scott: yep B was ridiculously popular.

415
00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:36,993
Rym: like like who.

416
00:28:37,093 --> 00:28:38,217
Scott: it is actually it.

417
00:28:38,297 --> 00:28:40,880
Scott: from what I heard It was like one of the best-selling bongos.

418
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Scott: Maybe the best-selling manga at least at some point, maybe still that in the u.s.. Ever.

419
00:28:47,364 --> 00:28:47,927
Scott: You look that up.

420
00:28:47,987 --> 00:28:48,309
Scott: I guess.

421
00:28:49,215 --> 00:28:51,324
Scott: and the anime Adaptation of it.

422
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:56,298
Scott: I knew at the time was somehow flawed or something.

423
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:03,674
Scott: now I have learned a little bit more information about it And that is yes the fruits basket manga is still.

424
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,219
Scott: you know that what it was?

425
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:15,820
Rym: It was like a late 90s to early 2000s manga right and the way exactly people were mad about with the original Anime, which I never watched even one episode of me either.

426
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,653
Scott: I never watched the anime any art of the anime or read any of the manga.

427
00:29:19,693 --> 00:29:23,900
Scott: all I knew about the story was it involves some Girl and some zodiac stuff, and it was so popular.

428
00:29:25,002 --> 00:29:29,420
Rym: Well also I knew that there's non-threatening boys who turn into animals if they get hugged.

429
00:29:29,781 --> 00:29:30,303
Scott: I didn't know that.

430
00:29:30,343 --> 00:29:32,512
Scott: I knew that till just now and I had to.

431
00:29:32,632 --> 00:29:34,540
Scott: often it's all just now when I watch it.

432
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,457
Rym: I had to know enough about it because running RIT anime.

433
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:48,060
Rym: I had like Say like if the punch line to a joke was fruits basket something something The anime club would lose their shit because it was so popular anyway.

434
00:29:48,622 --> 00:30:02,080
Scott: So what was wrong with the original anime from what I've heard from people is that it ended too soon And did not cover the full like it was faithful to the manga up to a point Yep, and then I guess they got ahead of things or something you know and they had to end it too soon.

435
00:30:03,383 --> 00:30:04,360
Scott: but not only.

436
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:11,249
Rym: Manga ran from 98 to 2006 and that anime ran from 2001 to 2001. right the not only anime end too soon and not cover everything

437
00:30:16,141 --> 00:30:35,140
Scott: But also because the anime itself had to have an ending when they wrapped it up or whatever They changed something in the story that was significant involving certain characters Such that even if they did pick up with more seasons It would have been literally impossible for them to continue with the manga's plot because they diverted.

438
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,273
Scott: They basically took like a 90-degree turn at some point right.

439
00:30:39,354 --> 00:30:40,417
Scott: so that was that.

440
00:30:40,818 --> 00:30:43,587
Rym: that's something I didn't know because that's what I have been told.

441
00:30:43,787 --> 00:30:53,160
Scott: so fruits basket got a new anime that this season literally Just now they made a new fruits basket anime, I assume for some anniversary of fruits basket.

442
00:30:53,621 --> 00:30:57,852
Scott: It is a remastering re HD remake of the old anime.

443
00:30:57,972 --> 00:31:05,096
Scott: only it is supposedly going to stick to the manga and Possibly go through the entire plot of the manga all the way to the end.

444
00:31:05,136 --> 00:31:08,240
Scott: Maybe yep Which they could cancel at any time right, but who knows yeah?

445
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:21,642
Rym: But that's interesting because having not known about that swerve and having not realized how long fruits basket was The what I'd heard so far is that the new anime is just the old anime like Exactly

446
00:31:21,763 --> 00:31:28,930
Scott: well because the old anime up to the point that we've seen I've seen I think three or four episodes maybe four because that was all that was on when I watched.

447
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:30,737
Scott: that was all that was out when I watched.

448
00:31:30,757 --> 00:31:33,886
Scott: it is Basically the.

449
00:31:34,229 --> 00:31:35,838
Scott: we didn't hit the sort of point yet Yep.

450
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:39,332
Scott: So the new anime is the old anime because the old anime was the manga.

451
00:31:39,372 --> 00:31:43,789
Scott: the new anime is also the manga and the old And we're not at the point with the old anime swerves.

452
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:48,127
Scott: so at this only few episodes in All of them are identical.

453
00:31:48,388 --> 00:31:51,680
Scott: the new one is just obviously 16 by 9 and better drawn.

454
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:55,557
Rym: So what I don't understand based on what I've watched so far.

455
00:31:55,617 --> 00:31:57,106
Rym: I mean there's only one like No.

456
00:31:58,881 --> 00:32:01,490
Rym: What I don't understand is why is it called fruits basket?

457
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,834
Rym: at what point is there a fruit?

458
00:32:03,195 --> 00:32:04,560
Rym: at what point is there a basket?

459
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:13,038
Scott: I as the same thing cuz I like fruits, and I'm okay with baskets Especially if they're cornucopias, I love cornucopias, but I don't know if that counts as a basket.

460
00:32:13,078 --> 00:32:13,320
Scott: really.

461
00:32:15,163 --> 00:32:17,260
Scott: It doesn't have a handle doesn't need a handle to be a basket.

462
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:18,877
Scott: Anyway, I love fruit.

463
00:32:20,141 --> 00:32:23,118
Scott: Yeah, there's no fruits or baskets whatsoever anywhere.

464
00:32:23,138 --> 00:32:26,500
Scott: fruit I don't even know if it's like an analogy or a metaphor for something.

465
00:32:26,581 --> 00:32:27,225
Rym: I don't think it is.

466
00:32:27,286 --> 00:32:29,100
Rym: I think you just gave it a fucking random name.

467
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,248
Scott: I think it was just a cool sounding English name.

468
00:32:31,288 --> 00:32:32,251
Scott: That's what it is.

469
00:32:32,573 --> 00:32:33,195
Rym: What's it about?

470
00:32:33,616 --> 00:32:38,911
Rym: so it is about A girl and I thought so before I watch this.

471
00:32:39,031 --> 00:32:42,700
Rym: all I knew is it's about a girl who is homeless and going to school.

472
00:32:42,821 --> 00:32:43,970
Scott: I didn't know that till I watched it.

473
00:32:44,433 --> 00:32:52,301
Rym: living in a tent Accidentally meets a bunch of non-threatening boys who turn into zodiac animals if she hugs them if anyone Them.

474
00:32:52,782 --> 00:32:53,865
Rym: that kind of is the plot.

475
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,669
Scott: Yes that literally is the plot.

476
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:59,800
Rym: yep, so this girl basically like family circumstances.

477
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:05,775
Rym: Cuz her mom died and she's living with grandpa and grandma because basically her family died.

478
00:33:05,815 --> 00:33:07,600
Scott: in some it was accident car accident or something.

479
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,354
Rym: So dad died of like an illness and then mom raised her on her own.

480
00:33:11,775 --> 00:33:17,920
Rym: get the impression mom Meant well and was a good person, but was not educated and might have been a delinquent.

481
00:33:18,542 --> 00:33:21,634
Rym: Maybe I don't know, but anyway mom dies has to live with grandpa.

482
00:33:21,955 --> 00:33:24,486
Scott: grandpa at the funeral They decide who's gonna take her.

483
00:33:24,527 --> 00:33:33,340
Scott: grandpa's pretty something that happens in bunny drop Yeah, where they decide who's gonna take which you know the family gets together and decides who's gonna take the orphaned child.

484
00:33:33,561 --> 00:33:37,419
Rym: Yeah, grandpa like has to leave his house cuz some renovations are going on.

485
00:33:37,842 --> 00:33:40,616
Rym: She made a vow to like take care of herself right.

486
00:33:40,636 --> 00:33:44,433
Scott: so grandpa Grandpa's like hey, I'm renovating the house.

487
00:33:44,453 --> 00:33:45,077
Scott: We're living in.

488
00:33:46,103 --> 00:33:47,851
Scott: Can you like go find a friend to live with?

489
00:33:48,012 --> 00:33:49,660
Scott: you know I have to go live in a tiny place.

490
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:53,055
Scott: I can't afford a big place right, but I own the house.

491
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:54,983
Scott: so once the renovations are done We can move back.

492
00:33:55,545 --> 00:33:57,873
Scott: so she doesn't find a friend to go live with.

493
00:33:58,114 --> 00:34:09,237
Rym: she just lives in a tent in the woods Yep, and somehow makes it work kind of well She's only been living in the tent a little while yeah, then a landslide immediately destroys the tent.

494
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:11,677
Rym: yep Cuz she's just like she doesn't know what she's doing.

495
00:34:11,797 --> 00:34:14,591
Rym: no So she ends up accidentally moving.

496
00:34:14,692 --> 00:34:22,083
Rym: is pretty good considering the landslide But I know we got fancy tents like I could live out of that tent Though that's cool.

497
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,869
Rym: I assume I guess so.

498
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:40,020
Scott: uh she accidentally moves in with all these boys and discovers Unbeknownst to her the land she put the tent on belongs to this family and So she encounters them in the woods, and they're like what is that person doing in our woods?

499
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,143
Rym: She's like.

500
00:34:41,384 --> 00:34:42,226
Rym: I live nearby.

501
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,512
Rym: one of them like like.

502
00:34:43,532 --> 00:34:45,840
Scott: we own all these woods, and there's no houses in it right.

503
00:34:46,021 --> 00:34:47,024
Rym: They're like what she's like.

504
00:34:47,505 --> 00:34:51,080
Scott: one of them is a classmate and knows who she is and he's the hot boy in school.

505
00:34:51,266 --> 00:34:53,656
Scott: Yeah So that sort of like.

506
00:34:53,676 --> 00:35:03,460
Scott: you know that Connection there and they end up being nice and saying we live in this giant old Style Japanese house that has sliding doors like a samurai lives here because we're an ancient mystical family.

507
00:35:03,545 --> 00:35:05,244
Scott: Yeah Why don't you come live with us?

508
00:35:05,666 --> 00:35:10,842
Scott: and then that's the setup and then not too much happens after that in the episodes I've seen.

509
00:35:11,184 --> 00:35:16,993
Rym: yep, so the one thing I will say I'll say the things that I like about the show before we get into how.

510
00:35:17,053 --> 00:35:21,870
Rym: I don't really think I need to watch any more Of it is that one the truth the secret.

511
00:35:22,192 --> 00:35:23,857
Rym: she figures it out instantly.

512
00:35:23,977 --> 00:35:24,339
Scott: That's good.

513
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,590
Rym: And there's like oh shit.

514
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:27,776
Rym: I guess she knows they're all magical.

515
00:35:27,796 --> 00:35:29,886
Rym: well You keep our secret cool.

516
00:35:30,308 --> 00:35:32,740
Rym: like all the magic stuff just starts happening immediately right?

517
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,144
Scott: well This is hosted is?

518
00:35:34,264 --> 00:35:35,026
Scott: it's a lot like.

519
00:35:35,146 --> 00:35:36,550
Scott: utana has the story of like.

520
00:35:36,731 --> 00:35:39,840
Scott: you know the prince and um what's it called?

521
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,413
Scott: What the duels you know princess tutu.

522
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:48,519
Scott: Oh, yeah, princess tutu also has like a fantasy a fairy tale that sort of you know.

523
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,216
Rym: But I like it when a show is like right away like okay everything's set up.

524
00:35:52,357 --> 00:35:53,060
Rym: now the plots gonna.

525
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:58,458
Scott: Basket has the fairy tale story of why is the cat not a member of the zodiac?

526
00:35:58,518 --> 00:35:58,980
Rym: no true?

527
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,581
Rym: Yeah, that's the.

528
00:35:59,622 --> 00:36:01,266
Rym: that's the long-term mystery right.

529
00:36:01,487 --> 00:36:05,660
Scott: and there's the one character who transforms into a cat a really angry, dude.

530
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,770
Scott: Yeah, right who's sort of like.

531
00:36:08,051 --> 00:36:09,518
Scott: he's in the family, but he's not.

532
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:18,824
Scott: he's like You know he's like not part of the zodiac, but he still transforms into a cat if he's hugged and it's the conflict between him and The rest of the family.

533
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:23,800
Scott: well him and the rest of the family mostly the rat guy mostly the rat main guy.

534
00:36:24,281 --> 00:36:26,046
Scott: Right who is right?

535
00:36:26,107 --> 00:36:27,210
Scott: and then the girls.

536
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:30,259
Scott: you have this triangle situation going on right?

537
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:36,020
Scott: Because the girl I likes the main guy more not the super annoying cat guy

538
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,047
Rym: But she wants my friends with a cat right,

539
00:36:38,067 --> 00:36:52,547
Scott: but fairy tale wise she's all about the cat right And she has some sort of connection to the cat in the terms of the fairy tale, but these two people who are somehow cursed You know it seems like they're backwards.

540
00:36:52,567 --> 00:36:53,691
Scott: which animal is which?

541
00:36:53,992 --> 00:36:55,275
Scott: so I guess there's some tension.

542
00:36:55,295 --> 00:36:57,081
Scott: of which one is she gonna end up With?

543
00:36:57,341 --> 00:36:59,126
Scott: if any are they gay here?

544
00:36:59,146 --> 00:37:00,831
Scott: they're gonna get with each other right.

545
00:37:00,991 --> 00:37:14,198
Rym: there's a lot to chew on for the fanfic writers Yep, so The other thing I appreciate is that once it once you learn character knows many ships will say if you hug what?

546
00:37:14,258 --> 00:37:19,280
Rym: if a Member of the quote opposite sex hugs any of these boys they instantly turn in.

547
00:37:19,601 --> 00:37:27,228
Scott: So there are girls in the family, and if they get hugged by boy by men presumably They would turn into the animal that they are from.

548
00:37:27,268 --> 00:37:29,676
Scott: yep, and we've only we're only a few episodes in.

549
00:37:30,038 --> 00:37:34,851
Rym: we've only met A few characters like the dog the rat the cat.

550
00:37:34,871 --> 00:37:37,159
Scott: so we know there's a whole zodiac which has how many animals?

551
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:37,923
Scott: 12.

552
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:40,380
Scott: Yeah, there's gonna be way more characters in this family.

553
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,529
Scott: Who's the dragon to accommodate all the you know?

554
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,160
Scott: I think that the mysterious one who is behind you don't see them.

555
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,480
Scott: Yeah, it was like behind a sheet or something behind a door.

556
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:58,850
Scott: They're like oh we have to go consult the person for fit for rulings right and there's like a head member of the family And they talk to them like through a door.

557
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:05,140
Scott: you hear the voice, but you don't see the character And then you know they're like giving out the orders.

558
00:38:05,341 --> 00:38:09,338
Scott: I presume that that's the dragon head of family person and they can't disobey them.

559
00:38:09,499 --> 00:38:13,654
Rym: yep But what I appreciate is that once she learns she can do this.

560
00:38:13,935 --> 00:38:24,160
Rym: they get transformed constantly Like she'd like she even does it on purpose to stop a fight like I like it when a current character Discovers a magic thing and just uses it all the time whenever it's practical.

561
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:34,219
Scott: Yeah, there's a little bit of the Superman thing going on because they're trying to hide it at school and the boy got a bad Reputation at school cuz girls asked him out, and then he wouldn't let them hug him.

562
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:38,486
Scott: He would like run away, and it's not because he is a jerk It's just cuz he couldn't be hugged.

563
00:38:38,547 --> 00:38:43,820
Scott: cuz they find out they did try to hide it right like Superman Trying to hide with a secret identity.

564
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:47,747
Scott: and sometimes You know there's that tension of.

565
00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:49,034
Scott: is it gonna get leaked?

566
00:38:49,376 --> 00:38:59,823
Scott: and there's a few times they had to transform at school because they got hugged and By some luck sometimes unbelievable luck nobody saw or whatever Right.

567
00:38:59,924 --> 00:39:01,729
Rym: so so here's the problems with the show.

568
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,074
Scott: see if that gets that gets out.

569
00:39:03,415 --> 00:39:14,218
Rym: the problem with the show is That it is not the year 2001 and it is in fact the year 2019 Because if this was a fruit fast again never existed before and this anime just came out.

570
00:39:15,163 --> 00:39:24,135
Rym: What I would say about it is this is the most generic like Basic ass trope shoujo with non-threatening boys the world has ever seen.

571
00:39:24,577 --> 00:39:31,799
Rym: it is just take Generic Jojo tropes like the mysterious like everything stick them all together into a show and just follow the formula.

572
00:39:32,502 --> 00:39:34,267
Rym: So far at least yeah so far at least.

573
00:39:34,308 --> 00:39:37,900
Scott: I heard from people that later in the show it gets dark.

574
00:39:39,034 --> 00:39:46,477
Rym: Yeah It's definitely something at dark secrets in the family because the show is not like.

575
00:39:46,638 --> 00:39:47,460
Scott: it's not one of those cases.

576
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,303
Scott: We're like it's bad.

577
00:39:48,363 --> 00:39:49,647
Scott: wait till it's good gets good.

578
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:53,880
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of like it's I and it supposedly gets real good.

579
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:59,057
Scott: It's like maybe if I you know like it's not off the queue now.

580
00:39:59,338 --> 00:40:00,040
Rym: I would watch more.

581
00:40:00,241 --> 00:40:01,148
Rym: I enjoy watching.

582
00:40:01,209 --> 00:40:07,780
Scott: I'm not gonna run out to watch it But I'm also not gonna run away from it because I'm not as curious as I am about fancy lala's dinosaurs.

583
00:40:08,182 --> 00:40:09,368
Scott: Yeah, it's like right under that.

584
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:11,500
Scott: in terms of curiosity about what the darkness is.

585
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,545
Rym: That's a good place to put it like.

586
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:22,319
Rym: I do want to know more about the deal and I do like the characters But it is just so Definitely more interesting than the characters and a lot of other anime where I don't care about them at all.

587
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,040
Scott: Yep, and I imagine as I do care about like the drama of the the cat guy.

588
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,349
Scott: Yeah, getting living in not being in the family.

589
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:32,415
Rym: I hope but I also I like the two delinquent girls.

590
00:40:32,455 --> 00:40:36,003
Scott: She's friends with and I also do The serial killer.

591
00:40:36,124 --> 00:40:37,026
Scott: Those are the best characters.

592
00:40:37,127 --> 00:40:39,113
Scott: Yeah, right side characters always the best.

593
00:40:39,153 --> 00:40:46,075
Scott: the like dark knife wielding one I like no question the best like you could watch the show just for them.

594
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:54,592
Scott: She has two friends at school And we're like these super powered awesome like outcast I guess they would be if it was an American show.

595
00:40:54,612 --> 00:40:56,180
Scott: they would be like two goth girls or something.

596
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,206
Scott: Yeah, but they're in Japanese school.

597
00:40:58,226 --> 00:40:59,571
Scott: So they're all wearing uniforms.

598
00:40:59,631 --> 00:41:00,714
Scott: But yeah, they're.

599
00:41:00,735 --> 00:41:02,440
Scott: they're like dark serious powerful.

600
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:05,880
Scott: They get picked on but then they get revenge and the mean popular girls run away.

601
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,475
Rym: Yeah, the mean popular girls are literally just in the Nami squad like straight up.

602
00:41:09,535 --> 00:41:10,680
Scott: Yes, they are clearly.

603
00:41:11,084 --> 00:41:12,579
Scott: You could just putting it on me right in there.

604
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:17,584
Rym: But yeah, like.

605
00:41:18,507 --> 00:41:20,113
Rym: I think I might watch some more episodes.

606
00:41:20,193 --> 00:41:20,594
Rym: not kind.

607
00:41:20,675 --> 00:41:22,923
Rym: I might just like watch it at some point Like it's a good show.

608
00:41:23,003 --> 00:41:27,619
Rym: I might watch as a secondary show like whenever I'm bored.

609
00:41:28,121 --> 00:41:33,459
Scott: Yeah, I think what it comes down to really is is how far is it gonna go if it's gonna cover?

610
00:41:33,459 --> 00:41:36,792
Rym: 23 volumes of manga that ran from 1998 to 2006, right?

611
00:41:38,821 --> 00:41:47,658
Scott: That makes me a more likely to watch because I know I'll get the whole deal But also I know it ends but also less likely to watch because there's so many episodes.

612
00:41:47,718 --> 00:41:48,925
Rym: It depends on If it cuts short.

613
00:41:51,201 --> 00:41:58,000
Scott: Then I'm more likely to watch because less episodes but less likely to watch because so as you got this sort of thing going on?

614
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:58,341
Scott: I don't know.

615
00:41:58,361 --> 00:42:03,240
Rym: Yeah, it's tricky there because I've generally been not watching things like Game of Thrones.

616
00:42:03,381 --> 00:42:06,040
Rym: I probably won't even watch any more of until it's done done.

617
00:42:06,181 --> 00:42:08,470
Scott: I never watched any Game of Thrones and it probably never will.

618
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:09,976
Rym: I really liked the first season like.

619
00:42:10,056 --> 00:42:18,255
Rym: it was really good Really good And then the end of the first season killed the only character one of the only characters I liked and then season two was Which one?

620
00:42:19,964 --> 00:42:22,171
Rym: It's it's kind of surprising.

621
00:42:22,211 --> 00:42:27,930
Rym: who dies actually, okay the main guy basically Yeah, it's like up making magic comic evap.

622
00:42:28,151 --> 00:42:30,680
Rym: episode four spikes dead and then episode fives.

623
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:34,440
Rym: Yeah, but it is more characters though, but then episode five is just like the rest.

624
00:42:35,081 --> 00:42:37,391
Scott: It's basically a really good way to run a TV show cuz.

625
00:42:37,411 --> 00:42:43,140
Scott: then yeah, you can just like, you know Get rid of actors get new ones, you know, they're constantly going in and out.

626
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,390
Scott: You don't have to give someone like a big long ass contract.

627
00:42:45,451 --> 00:42:47,440
Scott: Yeah, you'd like soap opera situation, right?

628
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:54,659
Scott: So, I mean that's a great story for TV But not for a movie where you have to pay the fancy actor a zillion dollars and they're in the movie for ten minutes.

629
00:42:54,941 --> 00:43:05,099
Rym: Yep, but I jet like especially like I would not have even read the first book of the wheel of time if it hadn't been done For a long time that's true, so I wouldn't have picked it if it hadn't been done.

630
00:43:05,388 --> 00:43:09,755
Rym: Yeah So the fact that the manga is done gives me hope that this might be a show I watch.

631
00:43:10,056 --> 00:43:13,547
Rym: it depends on how Many episodes it will take to tell that story.

632
00:43:13,949 --> 00:43:19,051
Rym: and is that story thick and meaty enough to where all those Episodes will be worth watching.

633
00:43:19,091 --> 00:43:20,100
Scott: Yeah, it also depends.

634
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,393
Scott: I'm gonna try to find out how many episodes it takes to get to the dark stuff.

635
00:43:23,694 --> 00:43:26,734
Scott: if it's a long number of episodes Then I might not go.

636
00:43:26,815 --> 00:43:27,340
Scott: it's fine.

637
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:40,212
Scott: If it starts getting dark and like episode 15 or less I might be like, ooh, yep But if it's gonna be 20 more episodes of just the school drama and the house drama No, maybe there's a way to like summarize that and skip.

638
00:43:40,272 --> 00:43:40,593
Scott: I don't know.

639
00:43:40,935 --> 00:43:41,236
Rym: Yeah.

640
00:43:41,778 --> 00:43:42,019
Rym: Yeah.

641
00:43:42,873 --> 00:44:02,553
Rym: So yeah It's a serviceable show and now that we know the story of like why the old Anime needed to be remade and they couldn't just like continue it it does make sense that the show is being remade and it is definitely like a very direct look at Late 90s early 2000s shoujo fandom.

642
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:06,700
Scott: Yeah, if you are a fruits basket fan You're probably gonna say we're wrong about a bunch of stuff.

643
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,920
Scott: But also, oh, yeah probably excited about fruits basket and I imagine you haven't read it or watched it in quite a while.

644
00:44:12,303 --> 00:44:13,652
Scott: Now you can go back into it.

645
00:44:13,712 --> 00:44:13,914
Scott: good.

646
00:44:13,934 --> 00:44:17,593
Scott: This is great for you Yeah, and if you're not a fruits basket fan, you never read it or watch it.

647
00:44:17,694 --> 00:44:19,020
Scott: It was a significant thing.

648
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:21,699
Scott: This is your chance to see what the deal was.

649
00:44:22,383 --> 00:44:25,358
