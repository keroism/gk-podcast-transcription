1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,591
Rym: It's a Tuesday, September 4th of 2011.

2
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:10,852
Rym: I'm Arin.

3
00:00:13,182 --> 00:00:13,940
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,706
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:19,138
Rym: Tonight, we talk about the surprising rock of ages.

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:20,946
Scott: The weed.

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,574
Rym: It's a me, Mario.

8
00:00:25,842 --> 00:00:26,857
Rym: Let's do this.

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:28,544
Scott: Mario!

10
00:00:32,992 --> 00:00:33,688
Scott: Where is the pasta?

11
00:00:34,772 --> 00:00:38,530
Rym: I don't know why I was thinking about this, but I remembered while I was on the subway today.

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,950
Rym: I was just thinking about old conventions.

13
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:45,770
Rym: I was thinking about OhioCon and how, you know, nowadays, we're the people who run conventions.

14
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,069
Rym: Okay, whatever other news.

15
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:52,690
Rym: If you ever want to disrupt people who have walkie-talkies, pretend to be Mario.

16
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:53,809
Scott: I was going to work today.

17
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:57,330
Rym: Okay, this is going to be so much more exciting than my anecdote.

18
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:58,408
Scott: Actually, it might be.

19
00:00:58,610 --> 00:00:58,987
Rym: We'll see.

20
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,817
Scott: But I'm not going to make it exciting.

21
00:01:00,857 --> 00:01:03,270
Scott: I'm going to tell it in my usual bland, matter-of-fact fashion.

22
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,230
Rym: Because I saw a whole bunch of people dressed up as zombies.

23
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,050
Scott: With absolutely no sensationalism applied whatsoever.

24
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,290
Rym: There was an entire crowd of people dressed up as zombies outside my office.

25
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,704
Scott: Yeah, the stupid protesters.

26
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,670
Rym: And as I was leaving work today, there was a stage on the street and all the stuff for a parade.

27
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,102
Scott: Great.

28
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,649
Rym: So I don't know what's going on down there.

29
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,028
Scott: So I got on the subway to go to work.

30
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,619
Scott: And it's getting to 57th and 7th.

31
00:01:24,273 --> 00:01:25,584
Scott: And I get off at the next stop, which is 49th.

32
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,420
Scott: And the intercom comes on, and they're like, "Police activity, 49th.

33
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,126
Scott: We will be bypassing

34
00:01:31,146 --> 00:01:31,186
Scott: 49th.".

35
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,058
Scott: So I make the quick calculation.

36
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:36,067
Scott: Do I get off now, or do I go through to 42nd?

37
00:01:37,132 --> 00:01:37,814
Scott: I got off now.

38
00:01:38,115 --> 00:01:42,390
Scott: That was a good move, because even though it's one block further away from the office, it's still close enough.

39
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,430
Scott: Well, it's funny.

40
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,190
Scott: And you're getting off the subway, which means you're starting walking sooner.

41
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:51,610
Rym: Because yesterday, the NQ was delayed due to two unrelated incidents.

42
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,530
Rym: Someone got sick and had to be taken off the train to a hospital.

43
00:01:55,312 --> 00:01:58,350
Rym: And someone got hit by the train at a different station at the same time.

44
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,095
Scott: I figured, they usually say police activity.

45
00:02:00,135 --> 00:02:04,690
Scott: That means, you know, that there is someone following the tracks.

46
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:06,030
Scott: Or something along those lines.

47
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:10,164
Rym: The thing is, they usually say, like, there's a Twitter you should subscribe to.

48
00:02:10,205 --> 00:02:11,630
Rym: that says exactly what happened.

49
00:02:12,575 --> 00:02:13,049
Rym: Every time.

50
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,850
Scott: I should find that Twitter.

51
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,819
Rym: Yeah, I'll give it to you.

52
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:15,890
Rym: I forget what it is offhand.

53
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,505
Rym: So it's always like, "Someone got

54
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:17,768
Rym: hit!".

55
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,814
Scott: Get off the train.

56
00:02:18,855 --> 00:02:19,618
Scott: Start going south.

57
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,347
Scott: Eventually, there's a police line.

58
00:02:21,387 --> 00:02:21,970
Scott: Do not cross.

59
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,681
Scott: And the street is, like, empty.

60
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:24,810
Scott: And there's a cop there.

61
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,770
Scott: So, of course, a bunch of New Yorkers duck under the rope and start going to work.

62
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:28,099
Scott: Yup.

63
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:29,615
Scott: And I went with them.

64
00:02:29,675 --> 00:02:31,304
Scott: And then the cop was like, "No, really?

65
00:02:31,364 --> 00:02:31,968
Scott: No, you gotta go

66
00:02:31,988 --> 00:02:32,229
Scott: back.".

67
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:33,401
Scott: So we all went back.

68
00:02:33,502 --> 00:02:34,290
Scott: And I go to the cop.

69
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,063
Scott: I'm like, "Hey, my work is, like, right there.

70
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:37,988
Scott: Can I just go to

71
00:02:38,028 --> 00:02:38,209
Scott: work?".

72
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:39,238
Scott: And he's like, "Nope.

73
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,046
Scott: Can't go through

74
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:40,227
Scott: here.".

75
00:02:40,832 --> 00:02:41,918
Scott: I'm like, "I can't just go to

76
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:42,139
Scott: work?".

77
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,306
Scott: He's like, "Calm and tell him you're gonna be

78
00:02:43,326 --> 00:02:43,507
Scott: late.".

79
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:46,730
Scott: And then some other guy comes up with a bike and he's fighting with the cop.

80
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,220
Scott: Like, "I pay your fucking salary.

81
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:48,845
Scott: Don't yell at me.

82
00:02:48,945 --> 00:02:49,288
Scott: Blah, blah,

83
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:49,550
Scott: blah.".

84
00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:50,450
Rym: Ah, bikers.

85
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,221
Scott: Yeah, I'm like,

86
00:02:51,262 --> 00:02:51,587
Scott: "Whatever.".

87
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:57,290
Rym: Actually, I almost got hit by a car yesterday and I kicked the side of the car and damaged it to prevent them from hitting me.

88
00:02:57,372 --> 00:02:58,010
Rym: But I digress.

89
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,084
Scott: Alright, so, I go around as a resourceful New Yorker.

90
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,130
Scott: I take the other path.

91
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:02,956
Scott: So I go around.

92
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,084
Scott: And I go around.

93
00:03:04,105 --> 00:03:04,729
Scott: And it goes through the park.

94
00:03:05,511 --> 00:03:06,415
Scott: Not the real park.

95
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:09,570
Scott: The Barclays building opens to the public area.

96
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:17,930
Rym: Yeah, because it's funny how New York, when they want to block a street or they want to keep people from going somewhere, very rarely do they block all the real ways.

97
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,990
Rym: So it's like the people who are native to a neighborhood can get around pretty much any police block.

98
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:23,733
Rym: Everything's blocked.

99
00:03:23,753 --> 00:03:24,296
Scott: Everything's blocked.

100
00:03:24,356 --> 00:03:24,718
Scott: I go.

101
00:03:24,758 --> 00:03:26,064
Scott: I'm getting close to my building.

102
00:03:26,366 --> 00:03:27,190
Scott: And another blockage.

103
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,155
Rym: Oh, wow.

104
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:30,050
Rym: Very rarely do they block everything.

105
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:38,230
Scott: But the blockage rope, the plastic rope thingy that blocked, is tied to the door of the service entrance to my building.

106
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:38,733
Scott: So I went in.

107
00:03:39,758 --> 00:03:42,130
Scott: And I get upstairs and there is nobody there.

108
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,821
Scott: So I'm looking out the window at the blockage out on the street.

109
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:46,470
Scott: And it's pretty empty.

110
00:03:46,912 --> 00:03:48,142
Scott: And I'm like, "What the fuck's going on out

111
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:48,283
Scott: there?".

112
00:03:48,303 --> 00:03:49,089
Scott: There's a bunch of cops.

113
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,023
Scott: They blocked off these two intersections.

114
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:51,708
Scott: Nothing's going on.

115
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,134
Scott: I go on the internet.

116
00:03:53,174 --> 00:03:55,021
Scott: I'm looking to see what's going, what the problem is.

117
00:03:55,082 --> 00:03:55,805
Scott: I look outside.

118
00:03:55,845 --> 00:03:57,050
Scott: I see some, you know, cops.

119
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:58,194
Scott: They got some trucks.

120
00:03:58,234 --> 00:03:59,177
Scott: They got some cars.

121
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,602
Scott: There's a city bus.

122
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:02,890
Scott: There's just cops everywhere.

123
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,818
Scott: And a fireman was there.

124
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:06,246
Scott: And the ambulance.

125
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:06,749
Scott: And whatever.

126
00:04:07,431 --> 00:04:08,478
Scott: And there's nothing going on.

127
00:04:08,518 --> 00:04:09,183
Scott: And I'm like, "Huh.

128
00:04:09,303 --> 00:04:10,069
Scott: What the fuck is this

129
00:04:10,089 --> 00:04:10,230
Scott: shit?".

130
00:04:11,071 --> 00:04:12,539
Scott: So I go on the internets and Twitter.

131
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:13,887
Scott: Of course, news Google has nothing.

132
00:04:13,927 --> 00:04:14,430
Scott: I go to Twitter.

133
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:14,941
Rym: Yup.

134
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:18,262
Scott: And Twitter was basically like, "Suspicious

135
00:04:18,322 --> 00:04:18,724
Scott: package."

136
00:04:18,764 --> 00:04:19,144
Scott: And I'm like, "You

137
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,149
Scott: motherfuckers.".

138
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:20,868
Scott: God dammit.

139
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:21,253
Scott: "You

140
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:21,800
Scott: fuckers.".

141
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:22,469
Scott: So I'm watching.

142
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,640
Rym: When has the suspicious package ever been?

143
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:28,590
Rym: anything but someone's underwear or a dildo or something?

144
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,694
Scott: So I look out and I see.

145
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:31,119
Scott: I'm looking around more closely.

146
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:34,270
Scott: And there's one bomb squad guy getting armored up with a big green armor.

147
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:36,356
Scott: And he is sweating his balls off.

148
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:37,280
Scott: And he's fooling around.

149
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,585
Scott: They're playing with the armor.

150
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:39,990
Scott: The cops are goofing off, right?

151
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,476
Scott: Then eventually the guy goes over to the bus.

152
00:04:43,077 --> 00:04:43,900
Scott: Goes on the bus.

153
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,407
Scott: Spends some time on the bus.

154
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:47,430
Scott: Comes off the bus.

155
00:04:48,152 --> 00:04:49,335
Scott: Gives the guy the thumbs up.

156
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:54,210
Scott: Waddles back over to where he started as fast as he can so they can take all that armor off.

157
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,256
Rym: How much do they pay?

158
00:04:55,698 --> 00:04:56,583
Rym: armor-wearing guy?

159
00:04:56,603 --> 00:04:57,729
Rym: Because guys, I'll tell you what.

160
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,505
Scott: Armor-wearing guy was sweating his balls off.

161
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:01,149
Scott: Let me tell you.

162
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,053
Scott: No, I'm pretty confident.

163
00:05:02,575 --> 00:05:06,890
Rym: I would not be uncomfortable going up to pretty much any suspicious package in no armor.

164
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:08,710
Rym: Because the odds of it being a bomb.

165
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,014
Scott: I also would have, right?

166
00:05:10,034 --> 00:05:14,270
Scott: So then all the other cops help him take the armor off and they give him a giant water to drink.

167
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:16,700
Scott: Then investigator guy goes up where nothing.

168
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,930
Scott: Then he starts measuring and evidencing and shit.

169
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:25,850
Scott: And then he goes, eventually another guy goes on the bus and he comes out with just some backpack and he empties it and there's a bunch of papers and shit in it.

170
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,050
Scott: It's a backpack.

171
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,350
Rym: God damn it, New York.

172
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,128
Rym: Someone left it on the bus.

173
00:05:29,492 --> 00:05:30,449
Scott: So here's my new policy.

174
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:30,919
Scott: Yeah?

175
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,610
Scott: If anyone, you know, the policy they want you to do is if you see something, say something, right?

176
00:05:35,851 --> 00:05:37,970
Rym: But that just inconveniences everyone.

177
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:41,069
Scott: If I see something, I'm opening it.

178
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:41,971
Scott: And you know what?

179
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:48,069
Scott: If someone else sees something and points it out and is going to say something, I'm just going over and opening it as fast as I can.

180
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,785
Rym: Of course then, you know, the hipster who's five feet away messing with something is going to run over like, "Thief!

181
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:53,407
Scott: Masher!".

182
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:55,605
Scott: And I'll just be like, "Here, take your fucking bag.

183
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:55,968
Scott: I don't want

184
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:56,029
Scott: it.".

185
00:05:57,251 --> 00:06:04,050
Scott: The only thing I might be worried about is if some other incredibly paranoid person tries to physically restrain me thinking I'm going to kill them by opening the bag.

186
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,250
Rym: That would be hilarious though.

187
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:06,150
Scott: Right.

188
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,229
Rym: It would almost be worth it.

189
00:06:07,772 --> 00:06:10,829
Scott: I would just hope, I would just, because it's like, you know, the person wouldn't kill me, right?

190
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,026
Scott: It's like, as long as I just get the bag and open it and be like, "See there.

191
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:14,308
Scott: Good.

192
00:06:14,489 --> 00:06:14,650
Scott: Done.".

193
00:06:14,771 --> 00:06:16,410
Rym: Maybe we need to make a movement on that front.

194
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,549
Rym: See something, open it.

195
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:18,249
Scott: That's right.

196
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,610
Rym: Let's make this a movement.

197
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,530
Rym: I'll try to make a poster.

198
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,310
Scott: That's what I'm doing.

199
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,410
Scott: Anytime, I don't care, you know what?

200
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,009
Scott: And if it's a bomb, if I'm wrong and I die, it's okay.

201
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,249
Rym: Scott, you took one for the team.

202
00:06:27,432 --> 00:06:27,828
Scott: It's okay.

203
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,249
Rym: You took one for the team.

204
00:06:30,075 --> 00:06:30,449
Scott: It's okay.

205
00:06:31,034 --> 00:06:32,029
Scott: I'll, I'll, it's worth it.

206
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:37,167
Rym: Alright, that beats my anecdote about almost being hit by a car and kicking in someone's side panel to avoid it.

207
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,009
Rym: Basically, they're going to like swerve over me.

208
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,010
Rym: And they didn't have their turn signal on or anything.

209
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,730
Rym: They start swerving.

210
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,889
Rym: They bump my bike, like the handlebar.

211
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,230
Rym: But it's like, it's so fast, right?

212
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,250
Rym: And I'm like, how can I get this person's attention?

213
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,590
Rym: Because there's, on my bike, there was no way to get out of their way.

214
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:55,529
Rym: I would have been smashed into like the curb and like, I would have probably been fucked up.

215
00:06:56,232 --> 00:07:06,570
Rym: So I smacked her window and kicked the car because the kick one, the smacking would get her attention and the kicking, I was able to jump myself onto the curb.

216
00:07:07,751 --> 00:07:16,890
Rym: So I do this and simultaneously, she turns to me with the noise and screams and swerves off and like stops in the middle of the road and her side panel was slightly dented.

217
00:07:17,012 --> 00:07:17,730
Rym: And then I just kept biking.

218
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,286
Rym: Cause fuck you.

219
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:18,970
Rym: That's right.

220
00:07:19,553 --> 00:07:19,623
Rym: Yep.

221
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,429
Scott: I haven't actually had to do that.

222
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,650
Rym: That was the first time I've ever been almost struck or struck by anything that wasn't another biker.

223
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,110
Scott: I actually haven't had those problems.

224
00:07:28,692 --> 00:07:35,390
Scott: And even though I've been biking to work for like two years, the only times I've had twice, I've accidentally bumped into people's side mirrors.

225
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,229
Rym: Ah, I've never done that.

226
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:37,639
Scott: Yeah.

227
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:40,010
Scott: But actually I just, you know, I was just like, oops, sorry dude.

228
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,350
Scott: I almost hit.

229
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,770
Scott: It's not like I broke their side mirror.

230
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,010
Scott: I just like sort of popped it backwards.

231
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:51,630
Rym: A Chinatown like restaurant delivery guy who in the middle of the night when I was biking home right at no reflectors, no headlights, no nothing.

232
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,630
Rym: I was riding the wrong way up a dark one lane bike lane.

233
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,568
Scott: I hate those guys.

234
00:07:56,635 --> 00:07:57,290
Scott: They're all over the place.

235
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,229
Rym: He didn't even swerve.

236
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,289
Rym: He didn't even react.

237
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,270
Rym: And the thing is I had a light like blurring in his face.

238
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:02,889
Rym: So bright.

239
00:08:03,153 --> 00:08:03,489
Rym: I don't know.

240
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:07,450
Rym: I don't think they, they're like shades just moving from restaurant to restaurant.

241
00:08:08,753 --> 00:08:10,210
Rym: But anyway, Rach came out.

242
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:10,868
Scott: Gaming news.

243
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:11,706
Rym: Rach came out.

244
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:12,602
Scott: Have you played it?

245
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,288
Scott: So here's the funny thing.

246
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,410
Scott: I played it for my iPhone.

247
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,469
Rym: When Rach was announced.

248
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,369
Scott: Rach for the iPhone is basically just like the old Area 51 arcade game.

249
00:08:21,031 --> 00:08:21,569
Rym: Oh, wow.

250
00:08:22,116 --> 00:08:22,409
Scott: That's it.

251
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,710
Rym: That was an okay game.

252
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,970
Rym: But anyway, I remember Rach when it was announced when, you know, when people said it was, you know, Rach is coming.

253
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:32,650
Scott: I remember thinking, oh shit, it might make a good game.

254
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,130
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, the thing that I was expecting, they never made a bad game except Doom 3.

255
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,049
Scott: Doom 3 wasn't bad.

256
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:39,750
Scott: It just wasn't anything.

257
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:40,970
Rym: It wasn't what we care about.

258
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,250
Rym: It was kind of generic.

259
00:08:42,712 --> 00:08:47,690
Scott: So, you know, when they're making rage, it's like, all right, they made Doom 3.

260
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,990
Scott: There's no way that they'll make the same mistake again, right?

261
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:52,530
Scott: It seems like they did.

262
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,670
Scott: They're going to do their usual huge graphical update.

263
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,910
Rym: Because I have a new policy.

264
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:05,269
Rym: I used to, you know, id FPS is one of those things on the list of games Rym is waiting for that will never come.

265
00:09:05,892 --> 00:09:07,510
Rym: I'm like that dog in Futurama.

266
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:08,049
Scott: Not anymore.

267
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:11,990
Rym: Well, I mean, you know, Team Fortress 2, Tribes.

268
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,650
Scott: But it's now it's because everything gets so cheap on Steam eventually.

269
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,109
Scott: And this is a single player game.

270
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:17,503
Scott: Yep.

271
00:09:18,373 --> 00:09:20,510
Scott: And it's not Half-Life Episode 3.

272
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,749
Rym: I bought the last game I bought right when it came out was Fallout 3 because I was actually really excited about it.

273
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:25,908
Scott: And that was a mistake.

274
00:09:26,331 --> 00:09:26,689
Rym: I played it.

275
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,090
Scott: Should have bought the Game of the Year edition.

276
00:09:28,271 --> 00:09:28,850
Rym: Yes, I should have.

277
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,289
Rym: The Game of the Year edition has stuff.

278
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:32,788
Scott: Assholes.

279
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:37,210
Scott: So I don't buy anything when it comes out because A, there's going to be DLCs and B, get away cheap.

280
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,349
Rym: Well, unless I will buy a game when it comes out.

281
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,650
Scott: There's multiplayer activities.

282
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:46,410
Rym: If there is immediate multiplayer activity that I have to get in on or I will miss it.

283
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:52,730
Rym: I mean, had I not bought Tribes the day it came out, I would have missed minutes of one of the greatest games ever made never to get them back.

284
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:53,247
Scott: That's correct.

285
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:58,769
Rym: Had I not played Counter-Strike in the early beta, I would not be the decade long Counter-Strike player that I am today.

286
00:09:58,970 --> 00:09:59,589
Scott: That is correct.

287
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,070
Scott: But that was free in those days.

288
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:10,279
Rym: Yeah, but Rage, I'm not missing anything by not buying it now, especially because I might buy a single player game if it comes out.

289
00:10:10,841 --> 00:10:15,490
Rym: and the reviews from both people I trust and people I don't trust are glowing.

290
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,650
Rym: But very rarely is that the case.

291
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:23,129
Rym: Usually the people I don't trust say games are great and the people I trust say they're like incredibly mediocre.

292
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,727
Rym: Nintendo was the last company I would buy games from sight unseen and...

293
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,610
Scott: I ordered Twilight Princess, whatever, not the Twilight Princess, what's the new one?

294
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,170
Scott: Skyward Sword.

295
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,889
Scott: Yeah, I ordered that.

296
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,730
Rym: Yeah, but no Nintendo game is sight unseen for me anymore.

297
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:36,910
Scott: Yeah, I didn't even order a new Kirby one.

298
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,150
Rym: I've been burned too many times.

299
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,569
Scott: I didn't even buy the last Layton, but I might buy the next one.

300
00:10:41,092 --> 00:10:42,249
Rym: Layton I kind of burned out on.

301
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:42,615
Scott: Yeah.

302
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:43,567
Scott: I don't know why.

303
00:10:43,731 --> 00:10:44,128
Scott: I don't know.

304
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,270
Scott: I like to count the matchsticks.

305
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,349
Rym: I do, but the rest of Layton I got kind of sick of.

306
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,970
Scott: Oh yeah, the non-matchstick part?

307
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,358
Rym: Yeah, the non-matchstick, it's like.

308
00:10:52,378 --> 00:10:54,550
Rym: alright, these plots are getting increasingly stupid.

309
00:10:54,651 --> 00:10:55,409
Scott: Yeah, they're not the greatest.

310
00:10:55,811 --> 00:10:58,009
Scott: The plot of the time travel one was the dumbest.

311
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:02,630
Rym: And their increasing number of bits to twiddle about which I don't give a shit.

312
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,750
Scott: Yeah, like the fucking gopher and his little maze.

313
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:05,370
Scott: Or the hamster.

314
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:11,750
Rym: It's like dude, I just want to pour water back and forth between the pitchers until Oh my god, if you made a game that was just called water pitchers and it was just...

315
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,730
Scott: And eventually there's like ten pitchers of water.

316
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,470
Rym: On like a three dimensional plane with like a fulcrum somewhere.

317
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,270
Scott: And you actually have to pour the water and you can't spill any.

318
00:11:21,592 --> 00:11:22,045
Rym: It's an FPS.

319
00:11:23,092 --> 00:11:24,349
Rym: You're running around on it.

320
00:11:25,392 --> 00:11:26,950
Scott: You gotta use portals to move the water.

321
00:11:27,398 --> 00:11:28,050
Rym: Oh my god.

322
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,167
Rym: I kind of want that game now.

323
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:39,429
Rym: But no, I have a long... Rage is a game that, go back to a younger, more naive Rym, and I would have waited for this game for four years and bought it the day it came out.

324
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:53,509
Rym: But, tribes, every tribes that came after tribes 2, and all the xcoms that came after xcom, and all these games that have just pissed me off or not lived up to what I wanted, especially now that they're not making a multiplayer game that I care about.

325
00:11:54,153 --> 00:11:56,870
Rym: I didn't even buy Rage and the reviews of mediocre, so I don't know.

326
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,290
Scott: Yeah, it seems like it's the same thing as Doom 3.

327
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:05,569
Scott: Really great graphics and engine and whatever, and typical mediocre, boring, walk around shooting stuff gameplay.

328
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,655
Rym: I mean, Opposable Thumb said, and I quote, "None of the game's ideas are thought out or fully

329
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:10,142
Rym: explored.".

330
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,690
Scott: Yeah, it's like John Carmack's not even trying to make games.

331
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:18,830
Scott: And the thing is, that would be okay if people, you know, if you were making an engine that people actually used, but who used the Doom 3 engine?

332
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,210
Scott: Nobody.

333
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,984
Rym: Not that I know of.

334
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:24,410
Rym: If they did, it was a real company licensing it for something.

335
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:25,688
Rym: It wasn't people making awesome mods.

336
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,150
Scott: Yeah, who's gonna make a game on the Rage engine?

337
00:12:29,252 --> 00:12:31,570
Scott: No, not mods, not other, right?

338
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,130
Scott: Well, I mean, look at the old business model.

339
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,430
Scott: Everyone uses the Unreal engine and the Source engine.

340
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:42,287
Rym: Quake 1 and Quake 2 were engines, and there were nominally single player games associated with them.

341
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:46,008
Rym: But really, the single player games are just there to say, "Hey, check this out,".

342
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,410
Rym: and the real action was in the modding and the multiplayer.

343
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:48,919
Rym: Right.

344
00:12:50,093 --> 00:12:51,449
Rym: Why can't we go back to that?

345
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:52,670
Scott: Yeah, right?

346
00:12:53,070 --> 00:13:01,628
Rym: I mean, why can't id make an FPS with what amounts to a multiplayer tech demo attached to it, and say, "Modders, make this

347
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:01,970
Rym: game.".

348
00:13:02,071 --> 00:13:05,790
Scott: I think you can make mods for it, but everyone's just making Source mods.

349
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,749
Scott: Why the fuck do they need to make mods for, you know, Rage?

350
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,889
Scott: Which no one even has.

351
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,966
Scott: People would have to have Rage to make mods for Rage.

352
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:14,830
Rym: I want someone to make the engine.

353
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,190
Rym: Well, I want id to make the engine that is designed for modding.

354
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:21,590
Scott: Yeah, but you gotta compete with the Source engine.

355
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,909
Rym: In fact, you know what I'd say?

356
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:30,830
Rym: Alright, it's ten bucks to get the "game," kind of like how you used to have to buy Half-Life for whatever dollars to then play Counter-Strike, which is a free mod.

357
00:13:31,651 --> 00:13:36,390
Rym: If you want the dev kit, which gives you crazy modding support, it's like a hundred bucks.

358
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,810
Scott: The thing is, they gotta have a bunch of resources available.

359
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,189
Scott: They gotta have all the modding tools.

360
00:13:42,611 --> 00:13:44,770
Scott: They gotta have the dedicated server.

361
00:13:45,132 --> 00:13:49,089
Scott: They gotta integrate it fully with Steam or something to get the server finder.

362
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,930
Scott: And they gotta have a multiplayer game from day one.

363
00:13:52,431 --> 00:14:01,470
Rym: Oh, also, anyone who uses any matchmaking system that's in a browser or isn't just integrated with Steam, I'm done with you.

364
00:14:01,711 --> 00:14:03,150
Scott: Or, you know, it doesn't suck.

365
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,749
Rym: I'm also done with GameSpy.

366
00:14:05,233 --> 00:14:05,446
Rym: Yeah.

367
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:05,984
Rym: Jesus.

368
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,066
Rym: Alright, so Rage is fail.

369
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,110
Rym: Yeah, but Rage, it's weird.

370
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,830
Scott: Haven't played it, but all indicators point towards fail.

371
00:14:13,072 --> 00:14:15,310
Rym: Yeah, well, especially, here's a quote from Eurogamer.

372
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,110
Rym: "This certainly is a video game like the ones we're used to playing in 2011.

373
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:24,130
Rym: Smothered and celebrity voice actors and shoulder-grabbingly intense expository scenes, blah, blah, blah.

374
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,642
Rym: Instead, it's something simpler and more

375
00:14:26,743 --> 00:14:27,427
Rym: old-fashioned.".

376
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:30,709
Rym: But yet, that doesn't seem to be what everyone else is saying about it.

377
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:31,397
Rym: Yeah.

378
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:36,170
Rym: Like, if it's old-fashioned, I'm thinking, alright, what, Serious Sam?

379
00:14:37,237 --> 00:14:37,610
Scott: Yeah, no.

380
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,989
Rym: I mean, old-fashioned means no single-player game.

381
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:40,374
Scott: Yeah.

382
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:44,330
Rym: What do they mean, old-fashioned as in, like, 2006?

383
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,910
Scott: Yeah, I don't know, I think he means old-fashioned just as in mediocre.

384
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:59,439
Rym: But much more importantly, very briefly, Xenonauts, I've been kind of ignoring, but now it's kind of playable and people have been talking about it, and apparently what everyone who's played it or looked at it said is, "Well, it's

385
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:00,406
Rym: XCOM.".

386
00:15:01,211 --> 00:15:04,349
Rym: And the fact that, until now, no one has made "It's just

387
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:04,570
Rym: XCOM.".

388
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,430
Scott: How many people have tried a bunch of times to make "It's just XCOM"?

389
00:15:08,471 --> 00:15:09,365
Scott: And they're all awful.

390
00:15:09,911 --> 00:15:14,170
Scott: And they've all failed technologically or made it something awful.

391
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,309
Rym: It's like, how do you fuck that up?

392
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:22,810
Rym: How do you take XCOM, make it into, like, I don't know, a first-person free-space shooter and think that that will trick us?

393
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:23,371
Rym: Right.

394
00:15:23,512 --> 00:15:29,009
Scott: But it seems like the Xenonauts people, from what I can tell, have actually made all the XCOM parts.

395
00:15:29,552 --> 00:15:31,749
Scott: They made the spaceship part.

396
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:32,349
Rym: Yup.

397
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:37,010
Scott: And the, you know, of course, the most important, the tactical squad-based part.

398
00:15:37,232 --> 00:15:37,870
Rym: But you need both.

399
00:15:38,231 --> 00:15:39,130
Scott: And the base part.

400
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:40,570
Scott: It seems like they've made all three parts.

401
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,967
Rym: I'm looking at some screenshots here.

402
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,170
Rym: Mission successful when you beat a mission.

403
00:15:44,431 --> 00:15:45,790
Rym: Let's see, UFO secured, zero.

404
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,870
Rym: Five aliens killed, plus five.

405
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,270
Rym: Guard corpses destroyed.

406
00:15:50,972 --> 00:15:52,589
Rym: Alien plasma clip, four.

407
00:15:53,236 --> 00:15:53,489
Scott: Oh, shit.

408
00:15:53,611 --> 00:15:55,249
Scott: This is exactly... That's XCOM.

409
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:55,886
Scott: Yup.

410
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,499
Scott: Are there fucking mind control?

411
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,868
Rym: shit fuckers all blown around?

412
00:15:59,511 --> 00:16:07,390
Rym: Oh, and there's a screenshot of a dude standing there, and you put weapons in his hands, and the guy's got M4 in his left hand and M4 in his right hand.

413
00:16:07,451 --> 00:16:08,407
Scott: You can't hold two M4s.

414
00:16:09,131 --> 00:16:09,569
Scott: You can.

415
00:16:09,913 --> 00:16:10,329
Scott: Oh, shit.

416
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:11,980
Scott: But...

417
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:13,259
Rym: I haven't played this, but...

418
00:16:14,856 --> 00:16:15,470
Scott: You have high hopes.

419
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:16,650
Rym: I do have high hopes.

420
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:17,906
Scott: Indicators point towards yes.

421
00:16:18,731 --> 00:16:19,670
Rym: And here's why I brought...

422
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,669
Scott: Magic 8-Ball says...

423
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,530
Rym: Here's why I brought both of these up.

424
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:27,748
Rym: I'm not speaking for every other gamer out there, because I understand that people have different tastes, and...

425
00:16:28,191 --> 00:16:31,750
Scott: Some people don't like games, they just want to watch movies where you push buttons once in a while.

426
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:46,270
Rym: It is also easy for me to say that games are good or bad, because they're to my taste, but I can understand why some kinds of games that I like and wish would be made don't appeal to anyone reasonable.

427
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,229
Scott: They don't have skills.

428
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,410
Rym: Or brains.

429
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:49,069
Rym: Not just that.

430
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,170
Rym: It's got Mega TF, or, you know, like, Weapons Factory.

431
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,549
Scott: It's horrendously unpolished.

432
00:16:53,770 --> 00:17:02,110
Scott: Those games, even if they were polished, are so complicated that I... People who aren't smart enough can't play them.

433
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:07,170
Rym: I might not be able to play them, because if someone made a new one of those, I zoom back to my life, right?

434
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:10,410
Rym: How did I get good at Mega TF and Weapons Factory?

435
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:15,769
Rym: By playing them for, like, 40 hours a week for months on end.

436
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,849
Scott: Yeah, but there are people... I'm not talking about people who don't like Mega TF.

437
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,429
Scott: I'm talking about people who don't like Counter-Strike.

438
00:17:21,593 --> 00:17:22,384
Scott: It's like, "Okay,

439
00:17:22,425 --> 00:17:22,667
Scott: dude.".

440
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:27,049
Rym: But I can understand why people might not like games like that, but they die instantly because they suck.

441
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:33,570
Rym: For me, personally, my tastes, and if your tastes align with mine, they don't need to make any new games.

442
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:38,230
Rym: There are enough old games that just need to be remade pretty much the same.

443
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,490
Scott: To update them to modern technology so they work on modern computers smoothly with a good interface at full resolution.

444
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:43,662
Rym: And I think there is money in this.

445
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:52,809
Rym: Ask any gamer who self-identifies as a gamer who's over the age of, like, 17, like, "Hey, would you play XCOM if they made another

446
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:52,970
Rym: one?".

447
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,286
Rym: And they'd probably say... No, like, they'd probably start salivating.

448
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,265
Scott: Go ask an 18-year-old and be like, "What's

449
00:17:57,407 --> 00:17:57,670
Scott: XCOM?".

450
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:57,774
Rym: Nah.

451
00:17:58,939 --> 00:17:59,370
Rym: It depends.

452
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,490
Rym: A lot of people know XCOM, because, you know, girl games, people keep playing it.

453
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,770
Scott: I mean, even, like, my brother is only four years younger than me.

454
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,789
Scott: He probably doesn't know what XCOM is.

455
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,890
Rym: They might know the new Xcoms that really suck.

456
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:14,770
Rym: Even the original sequel to XCOM, which was made by mostly the same studio, was terrible.

457
00:18:14,951 --> 00:18:16,810
Rym: And it was just the same game, just worse.

458
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,130
Scott: I might go home and play some XCOM.

459
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,410
Scott: Except I'm going to go home and play some Counter-Strike and stuff.

460
00:18:21,471 --> 00:18:23,810
Rym: I'm going to install XCOM on my laptop.

461
00:18:24,591 --> 00:18:25,768
Scott: Oh, laptop games, good idea.

462
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,109
Rym: Yeah, fuck yeah, and DOSBox?

463
00:18:27,635 --> 00:18:28,209
Scott: Yeah, good idea.

464
00:18:28,311 --> 00:18:29,650
Rym: Oh my god, I could play that on the subway.

465
00:18:29,872 --> 00:18:30,169
Rym: I might.

466
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:34,245
Scott: Anyway, there is a game coming out called Risk.

467
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:52,170
Rym: Now, funnily enough, people on the internet think that I knew about this game and already had an opinion about it, because there was a Twitter conversation, and I just saw, like, someone added me at one point, and said something about persistence in games or something, and I responded with, you know, a generic statement.

468
00:18:52,690 --> 00:19:02,110
Rym: I didn't look at the history and realize that they were actually talking about this Risk game, and their responses made me realize that I had responded to a conversation.

469
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,407
Rym: I had no idea what they were talking about, and I looked into it.

470
00:19:05,151 --> 00:19:08,530
Rym: But someone, people were emailing me and thought I was being all insightful.

471
00:19:08,891 --> 00:19:10,450
Rym: I had no idea what you were talking about.

472
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:12,590
Rym: But anyway, I didn't know anything about this game.

473
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,010
Scott: So there's a game coming out called Risk.

474
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:17,309
Scott: It's the same Risk that you played in the olden days, you know?

475
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,170
Scott: Roll five red dice against some white ones, attacker wins.

476
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,050
Rym: Well, sort of, because they've done something neat.

477
00:19:23,931 --> 00:19:24,910
Rym: Something kind of unique.

478
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:25,354
Scott: Something.

479
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:27,010
Scott: So this Risk is called Risk Legacy.

480
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:33,008
Scott: And unlike Halo Risk, which we still didn't play, or Risk 2010 with the nukes or whatever, this is Risk Legacy.

481
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:38,410
Scott: And the way this works is, number one, it's got mechs and shit, which I guess is stylistically good, even though it doesn't make the game any better.

482
00:19:39,431 --> 00:19:42,190
Scott: But two, is it has persistence.

483
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:47,150
Scott: Now, on the one hand, we always fucking complain about persistence in all the games.

484
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:48,570
Rym: No, no, we don't in all the games, Scott.

485
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,349
Rym: Here's an example of a game where we don't complain about it.

486
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,308
Rym: Burning a wheel.

487
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:56,750
Scott: Well, but that is not a competitive game, that is a role-playing game.

488
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,990
Rym: Ah, but it could be competitive.

489
00:19:58,854 --> 00:19:59,509
Scott: That would be lame.

490
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:00,449
Rym: No, it depends.

491
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:13,909
Scott: Anyway, you know, but in all the games, we complain about the role-playing video games not having enough persistence, like the MMOs, and we complain about the competitive games having too much persistence, like the TF2 and the MMOs with the PVP.

492
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:24,170
Scott: Yet here we go, the first instance of the persistence in the board game, and not a tabletop role-playing game, a tabletop board game that is competitive, Risk Legacy.

493
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:31,487
Scott: Basically, the deal with this game is, every time you play this game, there are certain things that might happen, which will change, quote, "the

494
00:20:31,548 --> 00:20:31,810
Scott: world.".

495
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:42,650
Scott: So you might put stickers on the board that permanently change the map, or you might tear up cards so that they can never be used again in the game, or you might cross something out with a marker so that it can never happen again or the rules change forever.

496
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,050
Scott: So the next time you play the game, it's different, and the next time you play the game, it's different.

497
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,901
Scott: Now, obviously this raised some concerns.

498
00:20:48,961 --> 00:20:51,290
Scott: Number one, what if you want to reset that shit?

499
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:55,410
Scott: Well, people are going to put their stickers on cards, and they're going to put the cards out in places.

500
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,350
Rym: Yup, now I want to jump in right now, Scott and I have been talking about this at length.

501
00:20:59,431 --> 00:21:02,010
Rym: For a game like this, it's a board game, it's not that expensive.

502
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,512
Rym: You know what?

503
00:21:02,873 --> 00:21:03,737
Rym: Just go for it.

504
00:21:03,757 --> 00:21:09,910
Rym: Just go in and play the game the way it's designed, and just go for it, because it's going to be way more epic.

505
00:21:10,471 --> 00:21:16,770
Rym: The point of this game, to make it a board game, I think, is not to have a game you play and preserve or whatever.

506
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:21,550
Rym: When you finish, you're done with this game, you've played it all the way through with your friends over the course of a year.

507
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:29,770
Rym: The board that remains and the torn up remains of those pieces and those cards is like the testament of your world.

508
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,330
Rym: Like, that is the story of your game.

509
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,370
Scott: As a role-playing game, that's kind of great, but as a competitive game, you can't take it seriously.

510
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,053
Scott: But you know what?

511
00:21:38,094 --> 00:21:39,906
Scott: In this case, it's okay.

512
00:21:39,926 --> 00:21:40,429
Scott: You know why?

513
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,390
Scott: Because risk at its root can't be taken seriously.

514
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:51,290
Scott: So to make a game that you can't take seriously competitively and add this persistence to it, well, it doesn't ruin it because it's already crap.

515
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,129
Scott: It's like, you added poop to my smelly poop.

516
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,340
Rym: But it's not just that.

517
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,270
Scott: It's already poop, dude.

518
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,165
Rym: It's more that it's bridging something into war games.

519
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:13,830
Rym: that's interesting, where it's kind of, you're interacting in this world, and basically, this is a board game you can play once, but it's not persistent like if you added leveling up to Counter-Strike, where you've removed the stateless competition.

520
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:18,390
Rym: The competition is who comes out on top in the end of this series of risk games.

521
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,970
Rym: It's like a tournament in a box.

522
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:20,653
Scott: But here's the thing.

523
00:22:20,694 --> 00:22:26,350
Scott: Number one, what if you play it once, and then someone else plays it, and you both permanently affect it?

524
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,630
Scott: Well, now you don't know what the second guys did, so they had to write a quest log or something.

525
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:30,072
Rym: Well, no.

526
00:22:30,092 --> 00:22:31,590
Rym: My take on this, and I haven't played it yet.

527
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,061
Scott: Two, what if you run out it?

528
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,330
Scott: Like, you've torn up all the cards.

529
00:22:34,431 --> 00:22:36,450
Scott: If the game can't be played anymore, then what?

530
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:41,730
Scott: No board game I have can be played out to the point where you can't physically play it anymore.

531
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,610
Scott: I don't know if that's possible with this game.

532
00:22:43,771 --> 00:22:45,049
Rym: I think it is, but here's the thing.

533
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,276
Scott: But that kind of sucks.

534
00:22:46,357 --> 00:22:49,489
Scott: You bought a game, and now you just can't play it anymore, because you've torn up all the pieces.

535
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:54,890
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time, how much more visceral is it when you pick up a new card that you have?

536
00:22:55,250 --> 00:23:00,409
Rym: No one else even knows it exists, because you opened the seal and looked at it, because you found it somewhere.

537
00:23:00,851 --> 00:23:06,290
Rym: And in the middle of one game, you show it to everyone, you nuke a part of the board, and you rip that fucker up and throw it in their faces.

538
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:10,930
Scott: See, that was something that they probably don't have in this game, which could be cool, right?

539
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:15,170
Scott: Is, you know, they've probably got a bunch of stuff where you permanently change the board.

540
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:19,450
Rym: No, Scott, they do have locked off things that are unknown and are revealed by conditions.

541
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,148
Rym: Oh, really?

542
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:24,230
Scott: Oh, see, I was just going to suggest that, not knowing it was in there, but that's awesome.

543
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,068
Rym: I went over the list.

544
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:30,810
Scott: You open the game, there's like an envelope, and you don't open the envelope until the time you open it up, and suddenly there's a surprise.

545
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,010
Rym: I have not seen the game yet, but I've read the list.

546
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,550
Scott: How awesome would it be if those surprises were different in different boxes?

547
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:41,290
Rym: Oh my god, then the nerds would go crazy, because everyone who plays and actually tears it up is killing a collector somewhere.

548
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:44,190
Scott: And what if it was like randomized, so like magic cards?

549
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,057
Rym: But, think about what this does.

550
00:23:46,097 --> 00:23:49,170
Rym: I want to talk a little bit about game mechanics and mechanism design.

551
00:23:49,770 --> 00:24:03,270
Rym: So, when you play Risk or Shogun, aka Samurai Swords, you know, any of those games, where one of the problems is that, you know, they're not cooperative games, in that you can't make a binding deal, or even diplomacy.

552
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,750
Rym: You have to enforce deals in the context of one game.

553
00:24:07,471 --> 00:24:17,570
Rym: There's no reason not to fucking betray people, because at the end of the game you start a new game, and holding someone's betrayal in a previous game, of a stateless game like that against them, doesn't really make sense.

554
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:22,748
Rym: Especially, you know, a good player like me betrays or doesn't betray randomly, about 50% of the time.

555
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:26,370
Scott: And also based on, you know, the situation on the board.

556
00:24:26,952 --> 00:24:35,730
Rym: Now, imagine instead a game like this, where you and four other people, let's say, are playing this box through, over time.

557
00:24:36,271 --> 00:24:42,270
Rym: If I betray you, you taking that into account is contextual, in all the future games.

558
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:50,330
Rym: So, alliances, they're still not cooperative, in that you still have to enforce alliances with force, in the context of the game.

559
00:24:50,970 --> 00:25:02,210
Rym: You have such greater opportunity to do so, that suddenly diplomacy matters a whole lot, where, in real risk, if diplomacy matters, your friends are idiots, or you're being tricked.

560
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,509
Scott: Yep, but despite all that, this is still risk.

561
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:06,250
Rym: Oh, yeah.

562
00:25:06,915 --> 00:25:07,710
Scott: Which is problem.

563
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:14,588
Rym: But, I will admit, as much, you know, we think about games a lot, we talk about them a lot, we lecture on them at, like, PAX.

564
00:25:15,551 --> 00:25:20,150
Rym: I had never considered making a board game permanent or statefully.

565
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:20,697
Scott: Never?

566
00:25:20,737 --> 00:25:21,770
Scott: This is a genius idea.

567
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,290
Scott: And you know what I think we need to do, to make this idea to its full potential?

568
00:25:25,554 --> 00:25:26,730
Rym: Do it with a game that isn't risk?

569
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:29,650
Scott: Let's do it with fucking Small World slash whatever.

570
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,275
Scott: As opposed to risk.

571
00:25:31,315 --> 00:25:33,550
Scott: Imagine that, you're playing Small World, right?

572
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:54,450
Scott: Someone breaks out, like, demon something, you find out that when that combination happens, then suddenly, like, you know, you open up, like, you know, the demons come out from hell or something, and now there's a new area on the board that's forever there, and now there's demons coming out every turn or some shit, and, you know, this mountain is now a plane, it exploded, it's now a volcano.

573
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:58,112
Rym: The fact that this game came out, and I'm gonna do some press stuff, I

574
00:25:58,253 --> 00:25:59,438
Scott: wanna talk to the people,

575
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:08,630
Rym: I wanna talk to the people who designed it, for real, I wanna get some interviews with them, because this unlocked an area, like, I'm already writing, like, panels based on this concept.

576
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,630
Scott: Yeah, well, it's designed by Rob Daviau.

577
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,380
Scott: I don't know if that's the same Rob Daviau.

578
00:26:12,461 --> 00:26:13,809
Scott: I follow on Twitter, it might be.

579
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,490
Scott: There's also another guy, Chris Dupuis.

580
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:22,030
Rym: It appears to be not available on Amazon, so I'm gonna go to, like, the complete strat tomorrow and try to pick it up.

581
00:26:22,211 --> 00:26:22,472
Rym: Yeah.

582
00:26:23,317 --> 00:26:25,289
Scott: Hopefully, though, it says playing time 60 minutes.

583
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,788
Scott: That's, I've never seen a risk that takes 60 minutes.

584
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:32,968
Scott: If that's true, it might actually be feasible for us to play this, like, 10 times or so.

585
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:37,350
Rym: You know, risk does only take about an hour if nobody is a slow dumbass.

586
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:42,030
Scott: Right, but the thing is, how would this work, it says three to five players, so we can't, we need another person, at least.

587
00:26:42,532 --> 00:26:46,308
Rym: We gotta get a set of five people who are willing to play this with us on a regular basis.

588
00:26:46,328 --> 00:26:46,850
Rym: to completion.

589
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:48,089
Scott: On the Wednesday night gaming?

590
00:26:48,591 --> 00:26:50,950
Rym: Maybe, because the Wednesday night gaming doesn't have a lot of people coming.

591
00:26:51,657 --> 00:26:52,150
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

592
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,010
Rym: Anyway.

593
00:26:53,717 --> 00:26:53,908
Rym: Anyway.

594
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,340
Rym: So anyway, things of the day.

595
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,479
Scott: Oh, we got some good things of the day right here for you.

596
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:05,036
Rym: I think we do.

597
00:27:05,621 --> 00:27:08,400
Scott: I've been digging deeper down the internet holes to find some gems lately.

598
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,640
Rym: Well, I learned something recently.

599
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:14,441
Rym: You see, I like musicals, and I'm a big fan of 1776.

600
00:27:14,441 --> 00:27:15,040
Scott: It's pretty good.

601
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,220
Rym: It's got a lot of charm.

602
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,263
Rym: Like, it's not good.

603
00:27:17,343 --> 00:27:24,640
Rym: in the same way that, like, Rent or Les Mis is good, but it's good in this, like, I think it's better than Rent.

604
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,100
Rym: Have you seen Rent?

605
00:27:26,823 --> 00:27:26,914
Rym: Yeah.

606
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:28,018
Rym: I don't know.

607
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:32,420
Rym: It's not bad in that the writing's a little derpy at times, but it's very endearing.

608
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,160
Rym: It's witty funny instead of, like, guffaw funny.

609
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,820
Scott: I prefer the witty funny.

610
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,700
Rym: The acting's great, too.

611
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:45,340
Rym: But anyway, so I had seen 1776, like, a decade ago, and, you know, that was the last time I'd seen it.

612
00:27:45,961 --> 00:27:54,587
Rym: And apparently, in between the last time I had seen it, and when some friends of ours brought it over to watch together the other night, I have to watch it.

613
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:55,660
Scott: I haven't watched it in a hundred years.

614
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:01,240
Rym: A song I did not know existed that had been cut from the original had been re-added.

615
00:28:01,863 --> 00:28:02,760
Scott: Oh, snap.

616
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,519
Rym: And there's a story.

617
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,740
Scott: But is this one of those cases?

618
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,940
Scott: The thing is, usually, when something is cut, it's like it should have been cut, right?

619
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:16,039
Scott: For example, you watch those Futurama outtakes, and it's like, "Yeah, I see where they were going with that joke, but I'm glad they took it out of the episode because it doesn't belong in

620
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:16,180
Scott: there.".

621
00:28:16,481 --> 00:28:17,102
Rym: Ah, but no.

622
00:28:17,282 --> 00:28:25,180
Rym: It turns out that Richard Nixon himself wanted this song removed because it was patently offensive.

623
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:33,631
Rym: In fact, he ordered that the negatives be destroyed, and supposedly, the director-- Uh, that's censorship.

624
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:34,300
Scott: That's not allowed.

625
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,527
Rym: Ah, no, because it wasn't an order as in "By Force of

626
00:28:37,587 --> 00:28:37,868
Rym: Law."

627
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:41,979
Rym: It was as in, "Yeah, or, uh, that's a nice movie you got

628
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:42,239
Rym: there.".

629
00:28:42,641 --> 00:28:43,025
Scott: Uh-huh.

630
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:44,139
Scott: All right.

631
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,320
Rym: Here, I'll just read the paragraph from Wikipedia.

632
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:55,860
Rym: The song "Cool, Cool, Considerate Men" depicts Revolutionary War-era conservatives as power-hungry weedlers focused on maintaining wealth.

633
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,035
Rym: According to Jack Warner, the film's producer and friend of U.S.

634
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:06,400
Rym: President Richard Nixon, Nixon pressured him to cut the song in the 1972 film version of the show, which Warner did.

635
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,020
Scott: No, pressured him, so it wasn't censorship.

636
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,280
Scott: Nixon apparently saw the song-- His friend pushed him around.

637
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,300
Rym: Yeah, as an insult to the conservatives in his time, which it definitely was.

638
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,004
Rym: Yes.

639
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,846
Rym: Conservatives of all time.

640
00:29:16,887 --> 00:29:18,355
Rym: It's a fantastic song.

641
00:29:18,395 --> 00:29:33,100
Scott: Like, it is-- It was striking how relevant, not just that song, but actually all of 1776 is-- I don't understand why people are continuously surprised when they look at history and they see the exact same problem of today repeated in the past.

642
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,460
Scott: It's like, were you not paying attention?

643
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,173
Scott: Was it not-- History has been the same story for centuries and fond centuries.

644
00:29:39,514 --> 00:29:40,760
Scott: Nothing has fucking changed.

645
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:51,500
Rym: It's like people continuously, A, are surprised that the past was the same as today, and B-- Scott, was it not Julius Caesar who went to war with Gaul after tricking the Senate into thinking that they were a threat?

646
00:29:52,160 --> 00:30:04,620
Scott: And B, not only are they continuously surprised that the past had the same problems as the present, you know, government and politics-wise, but also, B, are so naïve to think that their time in which they live is the time at which it will change.

647
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,180
Scott: Or that it will ever change.

648
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,119
Scott: So anyway-- Just like the people who think the world will end in their lifetime.

649
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,460
Rym: So Nixon and Jack Warner also ordered the negative of the song to be shredded, so it would never be seen by anyone.

650
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:20,220
Rym: And the editor secretly kept it intact, and it was re-added to the remastered DVDs.

651
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,720
Scott: George Lucas, take a fucking lesson.

652
00:30:22,441 --> 00:30:29,500
Rym: So, this song is now, like, one of my favorite songs in 1776 because-- Well, I mean, the content of the song is excellent.

653
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,716
Rym: No, but it's also a really good song.

654
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,588
Scott: Well, the song is an okay song.

655
00:30:32,608 --> 00:30:34,760
Scott: I actually prefer some of the other songs.

656
00:30:34,981 --> 00:30:37,061
Rym: What's your favorite song in 1776?

657
00:30:37,061 --> 00:30:46,760
Scott: I do not know because it has been so long, but I remember-- It's either Homicide or the slave song at the end.

658
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,300
Scott: I have very little memory because it has been so many ages.

659
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,387
Rym: You should watch it again.

660
00:30:51,407 --> 00:30:53,260
Rym: I think we could do a show on 1776.

661
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:59,940
Scott: I think so as well, but I just remember there being incredibly catchy songs, and I also remember that this song, it was just like, okay, that's funny.

662
00:31:00,102 --> 00:31:02,620
Rym: Also, critics hated 1776.

663
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:02,692
Scott: Why?

664
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,610
Rym: Quote the New York Times, "The music is resutely unmemorable.

665
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:09,158
Rym: The lyrics sound as if they'd been written by someone high on root

666
00:31:09,178 --> 00:31:09,359
Rym: beer.".

667
00:31:09,981 --> 00:31:13,100
Scott: It's better to see it on Broadway on stage than the movie, I think.

668
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,200
Rym: I think the movie's great, though, because it has some really high-caliber actors and some pretty great stage cinematography.

669
00:31:19,101 --> 00:31:19,918
Rym: Ebert hated it, too.

670
00:31:20,281 --> 00:31:20,626
Scott: Really?

671
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:20,950
Scott: What did he say?

672
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,959
Rym: He said, "This is an insult to the real men who were Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, and the

673
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,080
Rym: rest.".

674
00:31:26,181 --> 00:31:26,566
Scott: What?

675
00:31:26,748 --> 00:31:27,760
Scott: That's the point.

676
00:31:29,183 --> 00:31:29,725
Rym: Are you kidding?

677
00:31:30,126 --> 00:31:33,760
Rym: I get the impression that this is a surprisingly and scarily accurate representation of what they were like.

678
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:39,520
Scott: I think it's one of those things where in some ways it's clearly more accurate than a history book, and in some ways not, right?

679
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,526
Scott: It's like- Yeah.

680
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,130
Rym: Anyway.

681
00:31:44,042 --> 00:31:46,379
Scott: So, I have something really awesome for you.

682
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:47,137
Rym: Oh, do you?

683
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,927
Scott: This is MC Hammer.

684
00:31:50,348 --> 00:31:51,391
Scott: Except not.

685
00:31:51,873 --> 00:31:54,260
Scott: This is MC Hammer if he was Japanese.

686
00:31:55,024 --> 00:31:56,060
Scott: This is- It is so epic.

687
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:57,025
Rym: This is pretty great.

688
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,536
Rym: I defy you to get a bunch of friends.

689
00:31:59,576 --> 00:32:00,320
Rym: Don't watch the video.

690
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:07,080
Rym: Get a bunch of friends together, turn it on, and just watch it, and have a bet the first person to laugh owes everyone else five bucks.

691
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,380
Scott: Yeah, the thing is a lot of times people are able to keep from laughing.

692
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,378
Scott: I mean, I can't even keep from laughing on the-.

693
00:32:12,486 --> 00:32:13,099
Rym: No, you can't.

694
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:13,480
Scott: Yes, I can.

695
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:13,979
Rym: No, you can't.

696
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,460
Rym: I have to do a video challenge.

697
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,221
Scott: Sure.

698
00:32:16,943 --> 00:32:26,420
Scott: But yeah, if you go around the internet, actually, we've done a lot of research into the openers and closers and various television shows, movies, and things in other languages.

699
00:32:27,621 --> 00:32:37,060
Scott: But here is a new area in which is, you know, hit pop songs or hit songs that are re-sung in other languages by cover bands.

700
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,640
Scott: Not only, you know, but translated into the other languages.

701
00:32:40,641 --> 00:32:45,620
Scott: And there is a goldmine out there, especially, of course, the land of Japan where everything crazy and hilarious comes from.

702
00:32:45,984 --> 00:32:47,019
Scott: But other countries as well.

703
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:53,080
Scott: You know, you can go and look for, say, Italian Rolling Stones and see what comes up.

704
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,950
Scott: I just pulled that out of the air.

705
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:54,720
Scott: I don't know if that exists.

706
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,560
Scott: But, you know, some people, of course, in other countries, just listen to songs in English.

707
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:06,300
Scott: But there are many instances of songs translated and much humor can be had, especially if a music video was produced.

708
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:12,840
Rym: So anyway, very briefly, in the meta moment, the Book Club book, for which there will be an episode shortly, was The Ear, The Eye, The Arm by Nancy Farmer.

709
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,180
Rym: The next book is Scott's Choice, which has not been announced yet.

710
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,560
Scott: You'll find out in the Ear, The Eye, The Arm episode.

711
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,560
Rym: Is that like Sophie's Choice?

712
00:33:19,225 --> 00:33:19,394
Rym: No.

713
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:19,784
Rym: No?

714
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:20,183
Rym: No.

715
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,619
Rym: Do you have any idea what you're going to pick?

716
00:33:22,143 --> 00:33:23,100
Scott: I'm having some ideas.

717
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,320
Scott: I'm thinking, what do you think, a possible double book?

718
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,319
Rym: Double book.

719
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,278
Rym: That's...

720
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,440
Scott: And they're both small books.

721
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,179
Rym: But you realize...

722
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,219
Scott: They add up to be...

723
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,460
Rym: Scott, I will warn you of one thing and one thing only.

724
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:34,668
Rym: Yep.

725
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:39,640
Rym: Double book, should you do it, sets a precedent and I choose after you.

726
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:42,900
Scott: But here's the thing about double book is that they're a too tiny book.

727
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,440
Scott: I'm not doing double book like War and Peace followed by, you know, what's the book you love so much?

728
00:33:49,923 --> 00:33:50,839
Rym: The Count of Monte Cristo.

729
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,180
Scott: I'm not doing Count of Monte Cristo, War and Peace double book.

730
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:57,219
Scott: I'm doing like Hop on Pop followed by Cat in the Hat double book.

731
00:33:57,981 --> 00:33:58,560
Rym: Alright, alright.

732
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,307
Scott: You know, I mean if I did Dr.

733
00:34:00,367 --> 00:34:03,060
Scott: Seuss top ten, that would count as one book, am I right?

734
00:34:04,162 --> 00:34:11,580
Scott: You know, so if one of the books takes two hours to read and the other book, you know, takes two hours to read, I think that's okay as a double book.

735
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:16,969
Rym: If you will be at the New York Comic Con or the Anime Ghetto inside of the New York Comic Con, we will be there as a...

736
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:18,536
Scott: Normal people.

737
00:34:18,701 --> 00:34:19,407
Rym: Well, nope, nope.

738
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:20,940
Rym: Scott will be a normal person.

739
00:34:21,161 --> 00:34:22,480
Rym: I'm press and Emily's a professional.

740
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,818
Scott: I'm actually thinking about spending some time.

741
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,780
Rym: And if Scott had any goddamn patience, he would have also had a press badge, but no, he bought a badge instead of waiting for me to sort out paperwork.

742
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,620
Scott: Well, I figured worst case, I thought you were still going to do the paperwork.

743
00:34:33,942 --> 00:34:34,395
Rym: I did it.

744
00:34:34,987 --> 00:34:35,199
Rym: Alright.

745
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,960
Rym: And I got a badge, but since you already had a badge, I only got one.

746
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:43,440
Scott: Oh, but I was saying if you got two, I was planning to give mine away as like a prize or something.

747
00:34:43,702 --> 00:34:44,719
Rym: I might be able to get you one.

748
00:34:44,985 --> 00:34:45,239
Rym: Alright, well.

749
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:45,920
Rym: It's a little late in the game.

750
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:51,100
Scott: I know, but that was my, I thought, I didn't know that you, I thought I had under the impression that you had tried to get two and got one.

751
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,790
Rym: I had not tried to do anything.

752
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:54,018
Rym: I just, I do or do not.

753
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:55,059
Scott: Oh, well.

754
00:34:56,143 --> 00:34:56,677
Scott: Anyway, so.

755
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,199
Scott: Either way, I got a badge.

756
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:11,320
Rym: But we will not be presenting at the Con because as far as I can tell, the only panels that are like what the lectures we do are on a stage in a public area, like the place where Star Wars people fight.

757
00:35:12,669 --> 00:35:13,039
Rym: I don't know.

758
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:17,780
Rym: I'm going to reserve my judgment of the content of the panels at this Con until we attend.

759
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,477
Scott: Until I see it, yeah.

760
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,540
Rym: It's not to look so good.

761
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,580
Rym: In the immortal words of Mario, it's not to look so good.

762
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,780
Scott: I am actually going to spend some time at this convention because it only takes a few hours to go see everything.

763
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,980
Scott: I'm actually going to spend some time, A, I'm going to try to see a couple famous people like Frank Miller.

764
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:33,819
Scott: I just want to see him.

765
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,459
Rym: You want to see him?

766
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,740
Rym: I can put a slot in for a press interview.

767
00:35:37,285 --> 00:35:37,480
Scott: Eh, maybe.

768
00:35:38,144 --> 00:35:38,419
Rym: Also.

769
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,851
Rym: I might demand an interview with the Dr.

770
00:35:40,871 --> 00:35:42,400
Rym: McNinja guy just so I can be like, hey.

771
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,419
Scott: Yeah, we can try to interview all the low hanging fruits like that.

772
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:51,840
Scott: And then B, I'm actually going to spend some time sitting on the floor digging through comic boxes looking for some old ass comics that are missing.

773
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,458
Scott: Yeah, some gems.

774
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,620
Scott: Looking for the buried treasure.

775
00:35:55,061 --> 00:35:57,361
Scott: Like, and you can do Kids on the Block #2.

776
00:35:57,361 --> 00:36:05,480
Rym: I'm going to do something because last time I have all this video of I walked around the Con on Saturday and Sunday and the vast majority of the panel rooms were empty except for the people presenting.

777
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,200
Rym: So I want to see if the same thing happens this year.

778
00:36:07,241 --> 00:36:08,239
Scott: We should make an expose.

779
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,098
Scott: Like, look at these fucking empty panel rooms.

780
00:36:11,222 --> 00:36:11,636
Rym: So we'll see.

781
00:36:12,201 --> 00:36:16,280
Rym: I'll be there Thursday and we'll be there probably some points of Friday and Saturday.

782
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,500
Rym: I don't know if we'll actually...

783
00:36:17,802 --> 00:36:19,940
Scott: I'm actually going to take the day off work Friday just because I can.

784
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,039
Scott: I'll stroll over there late.

785
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,900
Scott: Take a nice long morning sleep.

786
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,598
Scott: You know, hang out.

787
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,199
Scott: Meet some people I meet there.

788
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,880
Scott: Maybe get some arts from the Artist Alley.

789
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,079
Rym: Some of you have emailed us.

790
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,960
Rym: If you want to hang out, you know, we'll be around the Con.

791
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:31,998
Rym: We'll play it by air.

792
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:32,959
Scott: Keep it loose.

793
00:36:33,562 --> 00:36:35,699
Scott: Use the Twitters to find us and such.

794
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,096
Scott: Alright.

795
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:41,199
Rym: We will be at and I highly recommend you also be at Magfest next year.

796
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,540
Rym: It's not a convention.

797
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,819
Scott: It's not that far away because it's already rocked over.

798
00:36:45,062 --> 00:36:45,420
Rym: It's January.

799
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:45,958
Rym: You know what?

800
00:36:46,282 --> 00:36:47,599
Rym: I think the hotel might sell out.

801
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:47,960
Rym: Yup.

802
00:36:48,201 --> 00:36:51,860
Scott: Be just quick to end this meta minute which is suddenly becoming the meta hour.

803
00:36:52,681 --> 00:36:55,600
Scott: You should check us out on the internets and all the places we are on the internets.

804
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,080
Scott: Facebook.

805
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:56,511
Scott: Twitter.

806
00:36:56,901 --> 00:36:57,599
Scott: Frontroadcrew.com.

807
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,959
Scott: Frontroadcrew.com.

808
00:36:59,100 --> 00:36:59,166
Scott: Etc.

809
00:36:59,400 --> 00:36:59,465
Scott: Etc.

810
00:37:00,442 --> 00:37:02,819
Scott: And I just want to remind everyone, nothing to do with us.

811
00:37:03,383 --> 00:37:05,999
Scott: It is October, which means only one thing.

812
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,177
Rym: Applebuckin?

813
00:37:07,566 --> 00:37:07,734
Scott: No.

814
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,079
Rym: Uh, pumpkin pie?

815
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:09,574
Scott: No.

816
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,760
Rym: Monster Madness!

817
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,934
Rym: Oh shit, that started three days ago!

818
00:37:16,163 --> 00:37:16,839
Scott: I already watched.

819
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,739
Scott: I didn't watch today's yet.

820
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,257
Scott: What's the theme?

821
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:18,919
Rym: What's the theme?

822
00:37:19,181 --> 00:37:21,320
Scott: Every week is another set of sequels.

823
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,580
Scott: So week one is all Frankenstein sequels.

824
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,920
Scott: We're going to see what week two is probably going to be all Dracula.

825
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,460
Scott: I'm guessing it's probably going to be all Freddy one week.

826
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,197
Scott: Something like that.

827
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:33,280
Scott: So yeah, it's sequelitis on cinemassacre.com Monster Madness.

828
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,339
Scott: If you haven't watched Monster Madness, go back, watch all the old Monster Madness from the beginning.

829
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,320
Rym: Oh my god, I am so pumped about this.

830
00:37:41,522 --> 00:37:41,718
Scott: I know.

831
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,640
Scott: I forgot about it.

832
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,520
Scott: Don't forget to go to cinemassacre.com every single day of the month in October.

833
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,076
Scott: Go to cinemassacre.com.

834
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,360
Rym: So, Rock of Ages.

835
00:37:58,882 --> 00:38:01,380
Rym: It's a game that you might have watched the trailer.

836
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,380
Rym: We talked about it before.

837
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,380
Scott: It's Monkey Ball plus Tower Defense.

838
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,559
Scott: Monkey Ball Defense.

839
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,860
Rym: With Monty Python-esque animation and art.

840
00:38:08,868 --> 00:38:09,740
Scott: The art is stunning.

841
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,980
Scott: I just got to say right, the Terry Gilliam style of graphic design going on in this game.

842
00:38:15,302 --> 00:38:16,280
Rym: And I'm a big fan of that.

843
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:16,660
Scott: Excellent.

844
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,399
Scott: And also the history plus mythology that goes into it.

845
00:38:20,741 --> 00:38:21,520
Scott: But coupled with.

846
00:38:21,581 --> 00:38:22,516
Scott: Muy excellente.

847
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,420
Scott: It's the history and all that.

848
00:38:24,481 --> 00:38:25,860
Scott: Mario says this is looking very good.

849
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:33,178
Rym: Coupled with Monty Python-esque humor of fart noises when you crush Charlemagne and things like that.

850
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,100
Rym: It's, I love the eek they make when you bust into their chambers.

851
00:38:37,341 --> 00:38:38,080
Scott: And the way they wiggle her ass.

852
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,220
Rym: But I wish they ran away.

853
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,580
Scott: Ten style points for Rock of Ages.

854
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,180
Rym: So, we won't review the style because it's great.

855
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,260
Scott: There's not really that much to say about it except for amazing style.

856
00:38:49,441 --> 00:38:52,160
Rym: The single player game plot is your Sisyphus.

857
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,679
Rym: I think you can figure it out from there.

858
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:57,520
Scott: If you don't know who Sisyphus is, stop listening to GeekNights.

859
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,239
Rym: Yeah, go, go.

860
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,020
Scott: I mean, you don't need to be a mythology expert.

861
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,400
Scott: But I mean, all I know is Sisyphus pushed the rock up the hill.

862
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,618
Rym: Sisyphus in the very least.

863
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,820
Scott: That's all you got to know.

864
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,239
Rym: Well, no, he didn't actually push it up the hill.

865
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,094
Scott: Yeah, he tried.

866
00:39:09,643 --> 00:39:09,900
Scott: He tried.

867
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:14,900
Scott: Anyway, so this game came out early September, about a month ago.

868
00:39:15,001 --> 00:39:16,040
Scott: It's ten bucks on Steam.

869
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,280
Scott: I'm sure during the Steam holiday sale it'll be much cheaper.

870
00:39:18,381 --> 00:39:19,839
Scott: Maybe buy it then if you really want to.

871
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,160
Scott: It's also on the Xbox.

872
00:39:21,904 --> 00:39:22,720
Scott: I wouldn't buy it on Xbox.

873
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,540
Scott: If something's available on Steam and Xbox, I'd always pick Steam.

874
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,160
Scott: But that's because I have a computer connected to my TV.

875
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:36,199
Scott: If you are dumb and don't have a computer connected to your TV and you don't have wireless Xbox controllers for your computer, maybe you should buy it on Xbox.

876
00:39:37,183 --> 00:39:37,599
Scott: And that sucks.

877
00:39:38,524 --> 00:39:38,700
Scott: Anyway.

878
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:50,040
Rym: So, the gameplay, as far as we can tell from the trailer, was that you build tower defense style defenses and you alternate between that and monkey balling a rock into someone's gates.

879
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:54,980
Scott: Yeah, so basically you start the game and there's a big ramp, right?

880
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,678
Scott: Monkey ball style.

881
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,179
Scott: And at the end of the ramp is a gate.

882
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:02,880
Scott: And when that gate is smashed open, your character is in that gate and he's going to get squished and then you lose.

883
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:11,640
Scott: So there's two symmetrically opposed ramps with gates at either end and you take turns rolling a rock down this ramp, monkey ball style.

884
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,280
Scott: Now, the controls are pretty good.

885
00:40:13,522 --> 00:40:15,880
Scott: They're smooth, but they're not monkey ball smooth.

886
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,600
Rym: They're very, like, full of momentum.

887
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,080
Rym: It is very hard to turn your rock.

888
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,040
Scott: And the camera control is not ideal either.

889
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,460
Scott: It's kind of loosey goosey and you can never quite get the camera exactly where you want it.

890
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:34,700
Scott: Like, I'll rotate the camera to the side because I'm going around a turn and I want to be able to see what's coming up around the turn, but then I can't really see where I'm going.

891
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:38,160
Scott: It's like I can't get the camera zoomed out to the right spot enough.

892
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,060
Scott: I don't know.

893
00:40:39,483 --> 00:40:40,800
Scott: But it's good enough, right?

894
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,580
Scott: It's not like the controls ruin the game.

895
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:46,100
Scott: They're just sub-perfect, not sub-par, right?

896
00:40:47,162 --> 00:40:49,500
Scott: So you roll your rock down the hill, you smash a bunch of stuff.

897
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,620
Scott: When you smash stuff, you get money, which is important.

898
00:40:53,222 --> 00:40:56,100
Scott: And eventually you get to the bottom and you smash into the gates.

899
00:40:56,201 --> 00:41:04,600
Scott: If you fall off, you get dropped back on, but you lose time, which is actually really important because your opponent is also rolling his rock down the hill and it's a race.

900
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,580
Rym: It's whoever smashes the other guy's dude first.

901
00:41:08,061 --> 00:41:12,453
Scott: So if you fall off, you lose time, but that means the other guy is now ahead of you and you're in big trouble.

902
00:41:12,635 --> 00:41:13,020
Scott: Big trouble.

903
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:20,680
Rym: Now, the concept of this game was fantastic, and we bought it basically without seeing any reviews because we assumed there was a lot of potential.

904
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,220
Scott: And it was worth it for the style, but it might not be worth it for you.

905
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,199
Rym: So one, there's no single player game.

906
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,798
Rym: Don't even, like, there's...

907
00:41:28,022 --> 00:41:29,140
Scott: There is a single player game.

908
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:36,159
Rym: Alright, there's a half hour of a single player game, at the end of which is a locked gate, and if you didn't pick up all the McGuffins along the way, you can't get past it.

909
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,038
Scott: Yeah, sort of annoying.

910
00:41:37,141 --> 00:41:37,860
Rym: I didn't even bother.

911
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:40,900
Scott: I can't get past death, but then again, I haven't tried.

912
00:41:41,302 --> 00:41:43,098
Scott: I beat death on my first try.

913
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,960
Scott: I didn't get past the black plague, but then again, I stopped trying after a few tries.

914
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:55,040
Rym: Yeah, so the trouble with the game, when we played it right away, is that I assumed, alright, this game is really only going to be good multiplayer.

915
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,040
Rym: One, memorization of the maps matters more than almost any other factor.

916
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:03,820
Rym: There are Mario Kart style shortcuts on most of the maps.

917
00:42:04,641 --> 00:42:15,480
Rym: So for most of them, the game comes down to, you know, what's the Mario Kart bullshit way to get down faster, and how to, you know, try to block the other person from doing the Mario Kart bullshit way.

918
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:22,660
Scott: So that they have to go the long way around, which makes them go slower, which means you'll get your rock down the hill faster, with less damage, and smash their gates faster.

919
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,020
Rym: So map memorization matters more than any skill.

920
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:32,458
Scott: Right, because like, it doesn't matter how you build the defenses or any of that stuff, if you know the right way to go down the hill, and there's defenses in the way, you can get around them.

921
00:42:32,661 --> 00:42:35,260
Rym: Two, defenses by and large don't mean shit.

922
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:35,918
Scott: Like I just said.

923
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,720
Rym: Yeah, but you also don't get enough time to build them.

924
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,940
Rym: I want three times more time, or configurable time, for multiplayer.

925
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,900
Scott: Yeah, or give me more money to build the freaking defenses.

926
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:50,420
Scott: Like, you can't build a significant enough number of them to actually make any sort of defense.

927
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:54,640
Scott: And you're only allowed to build them in these very limited areas where the board is white.

928
00:42:55,143 --> 00:42:56,160
Rym: I should be able to build them anywhere.

929
00:42:56,561 --> 00:43:01,940
Scott: If I could just build, I think they probably tested building them anywhere, and realized that people just make horrible, impossible to pass defenses.

930
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,279
Rym: Which would have been way more fun.

931
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:08,179
Scott: Which would have actually helped the game out a lot, if people could build nasty defenses like that.

932
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,408
Scott: You know?

933
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:10,297
Scott: But as you can't.

934
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:14,060
Scott: So basically, all your defenses can do is slow down the other guy a tiny bit.

935
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:26,080
Scott: And if he knows the map, knows the ways down the hill, and is actually good at controlling the rock, no matter how well you build the defenses, even if you have infinite money, if you're limited to those little areas, you really can't build an effective defense.

936
00:43:26,921 --> 00:43:31,060
Scott: No defense anyone has built has been effective against me, especially since the rock can jump.

937
00:43:31,522 --> 00:43:34,900
Scott: I tried to get clever, I built a big wall with dynamite in front of it.

938
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,560
Rym: Yeah, you made three dynamite deep, I still jumped the whole fucking thing.

939
00:43:37,801 --> 00:43:39,220
Scott: Ram just jumped over the whole thing.

940
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,166
Scott: And it's like, really?

941
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,120
Scott: What could I possibly have done there?

942
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:46,140
Rym: I had a lot more success by making a surprisingly deep checkerboard of dynamite.

943
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:51,500
Scott: Yeah, I would have put catapults behind it to knock you back when you tried to jump into the dynamite and the walls.

944
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,440
Rym: But you didn't have enough money.

945
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:53,486
Scott: No, I had money.

946
00:43:53,869 --> 00:43:55,640
Scott: Actually, there was no place to do that.

947
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,499
Scott: There was no place on the board with enough white room next to it.

948
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,487
Rym: It just comes down to.

949
00:43:59,507 --> 00:44:01,140
Rym: the mechanics are really neat.

950
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:06,680
Rym: You place defenses, and each defense type is really unique, and there's many different levels that cost more.

951
00:44:07,181 --> 00:44:10,480
Rym: Like cow, elephant, like mammoth, whatever.

952
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,600
Scott: But you don't have enough time or money, despite the fact that you can do great stuff.

953
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,730
Scott: Yeah, and it's like, well, you do have more time.

954
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:16,720
Scott: You actually have infinite time.

955
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,960
Scott: But eventually, your rock is ready to roll.

956
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,099
Rym: And you want to roll that rock right away.

957
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,400
Scott: You need to roll that rock immediately, or else you're screwed.

958
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,305
Rym: Because, so we played this game.

959
00:44:24,887 --> 00:44:29,439
Rym: Number of rocks to the bottom was the only factor that mattered.

960
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,220
Rym: I played in single player.

961
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:31,900
Rym: Three rocks.

962
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:32,723
Rym: Three rocks.

963
00:44:32,763 --> 00:44:36,260
Scott: Pretty much, the game boils down to, no matter what defenses you build, none of that matters.

964
00:44:36,545 --> 00:44:36,653
Scott: Once!

965
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,640
Scott: Whoever gets three rocks to the bottom of the hill first wins, end of story.

966
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:41,342
Scott: Once.

967
00:44:41,362 --> 00:44:43,052
Rym: The first time I played against death.

968
00:44:43,153 --> 00:44:44,340
Rym: The only time I played against death.

969
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:52,340
Rym: His third rock left a tiny sliver, because for whatever reason, the rock was basically a baseball by the time it got to the bottom.

970
00:44:53,241 --> 00:44:57,940
Scott: But yet, 99% of the time, three rocks to the bottom first wins.

971
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,200
Scott: So whoever's better at the monkey ball, rock rolling part, is the kid.

972
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,619
Rym: Which is mostly memorization.

973
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:07,020
Scott: Which is mostly memorization, because the controls, while not perfect, they're really good.

974
00:45:07,682 --> 00:45:10,180
Scott: And you can get ahold of them with your Xbox controller.

975
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:13,595
Rym: Now, we saw all these problems when we played the single player.

976
00:45:13,615 --> 00:45:14,800
Rym: We had not actually played multiplayer.

977
00:45:14,961 --> 00:45:17,740
Scott: We kept planning to play the multiplayer online, which it does support.

978
00:45:18,203 --> 00:45:19,920
Scott: But we did not, because we just didn't.

979
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,140
Rym: Now it does online and local split screen, and they're both done as well as they can be done.

980
00:45:24,623 --> 00:45:25,360
Rym: But here's the trouble.

981
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,960
Rym: So, as we went to play it today, there was a Steam update.

982
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:32,540
Scott: Yeah, we played multiplayer for the first time today, before playing the real game.

983
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,999
Rym: And there was an update we did not know about.

984
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,437
Rym: And the second line item is, and I'll read it verbatim.

985
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,206
Rym: "Recalibrated boulder damage to castle gates.

986
00:45:41,648 --> 00:45:45,859
Rym: Smaller boulder sizes do less damage so that not all matches can be completed in three

987
00:45:45,919 --> 00:45:46,160
Rym: rolls.".

988
00:45:46,301 --> 00:45:46,947
Scott: So they knew.

989
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:48,220
Scott: This gave me some confidence.

990
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,120
Scott: Because A, there's a patch, right?

991
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,980
Scott: And B, the people who are making the game knew that this is a problem.

992
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:53,723
Scott: Now this is rare.

993
00:45:53,923 --> 00:45:58,160
Scott: Usually you get a case where you have, you know, games sometimes have technology problems.

994
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,040
Scott: Sometimes they have, you know, well games can have a lot of different problems.

995
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:05,120
Scott: But mostly what I've seen lately is games with A, balance problems.

996
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,520
Scott: Like a really good tower defense game, where they just didn't think about the numbers.

997
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:11,731
Scott: So it ends up, just use the laser, you know, tower.

998
00:46:11,952 --> 00:46:13,980
Scott: Don't use any other tower, and the game's boring, right?

999
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:16,267
Scott: Or B, technology problems.

1000
00:46:16,388 --> 00:46:20,260
Scott: NS2, they keep working on balancing the game, but their networking just fucking doesn't work.

1001
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,180
Rym: Yeah, that one skulk biting the frozen marines for an hour.

1002
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:23,640
Rym: Exactly.

1003
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,836
Rym: What I don't get is, why is that one skulk playing?

1004
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:26,440
Rym: It's a human.

1005
00:46:27,261 --> 00:46:27,943
Scott: What are you doing?

1006
00:46:28,023 --> 00:46:33,080
Rym: Why are you just sitting there on an empty, on a full server, biting a bunch of T-pose marines?

1007
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,680
Scott: Maybe they don't see that, and only we have the problem.

1008
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:36,518
Scott: So what does he see?

1009
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,909
Scott: Maybe someone has like an NS2 virus.

1010
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:39,440
Scott: He's playing the real game, it's for real.

1011
00:46:40,563 --> 00:46:41,840
Scott: It's just our computers are fucked up.

1012
00:46:43,641 --> 00:46:48,460
Scott: Anyway, but you know, Rock of Ages had the problem where they didn't think about the numbers, you know.

1013
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:49,820
Scott: It ended up being three rocks boring.

1014
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,400
Rym: But the fact that they do the exact problem.

1015
00:46:52,741 --> 00:46:54,820
Scott: And they patched it, or at least attempted to patch it.

1016
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:56,580
Rym: So as far as I can tell, the patch did nothing.

1017
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:00,216
Scott: We played it multiplayer, and it's still three rocks to the bottom wins.

1018
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:01,020
Scott: Nothing has changed.

1019
00:47:01,201 --> 00:47:02,518
Scott: Even though the patch said they changed it.

1020
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:11,079
Rym: All you guys have to do is give us three times, no, give us, for multiplayer, configurable amount of time, and money scaling.

1021
00:47:11,581 --> 00:47:14,500
Scott: Give the players tons more money, so they can build a lot more defenses.

1022
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,960
Rym: Make the rocks- Now you might think, Room and Scott, you can get more money by hitting more stuff on the way down.

1023
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:24,120
Rym: Then it doesn't matter, because then you're too slow and the other guy gets three boulders and wins anyway.

1024
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,680
Scott: Right, also make the rocks do a very small amount of damage.

1025
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:31,440
Rym: It should be on average, I think, five rocks if they're all perfect.

1026
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:39,460
Scott: Right, so for example, you should scale the game to where if a guy rolls five rocks to the bottom, and each rock is unscathed.

1027
00:47:39,561 --> 00:47:42,640
Scott: It didn't fall off, it didn't touch a single cow, it didn't do anything.

1028
00:47:43,141 --> 00:47:45,860
Scott: It touches, it hits that wall completely unscathed.

1029
00:47:46,081 --> 00:47:48,295
Scott: That does exactly 20% of the full health bar.

1030
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,340
Scott: If it gets hit by even one catapult, that should mean that you now need a sixth rock.

1031
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,760
Scott: Right, that's, you know, it should do a significant amount of damage.

1032
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,400
Scott: And the rocks should be so vulnerable to defenses.

1033
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,820
Scott: Don't make the defenses actually be more dangerous.

1034
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,920
Scott: I kind of like how you can't build a perfect defense that can't be passed.

1035
00:48:06,241 --> 00:48:11,120
Scott: But, you know, you do get damaged by defenses sometimes if they're set up cleverly and they do slow you down a little bit.

1036
00:48:11,582 --> 00:48:13,940
Scott: They just need to damage the rock a lot more.

1037
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:19,720
Scott: So that even though it inevitably gets to the bottom, right, that the amount of damage it does is very minor.

1038
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:23,015
Scott: Also, if a rock falls off the edge, you don't get it back.

1039
00:48:23,176 --> 00:48:24,080
Scott: You gotta build a new rock.

1040
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:31,340
Scott: Also, maybe consider playing with allowing people to spend money to build the rock faster, right?

1041
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,819
Scott: For a lot of money though, a lot.

1042
00:48:33,101 --> 00:48:39,260
Scott: So, it's like I give up on defenses, even though they're much more effective now, to get another rock really soon because I fell off the edge.

1043
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:45,420
Rym: The only real way to fix this, you guys who made this game, don't try to figure out the balance.

1044
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,820
Rym: Just make it all configurable in the multiplayer and the crowd will figure it out in a hurry.

1045
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:54,740
Scott: And collect data from all the clients, see what people are configuring in their games.

1046
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,589
Rym: Oh, you don't even need to.

1047
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:56,660
Rym: I don't care what you're configuring.

1048
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:59,640
Rym: Just as long as I can change it, I'll be really happy with this game.

1049
00:48:59,921 --> 00:49:06,380
Scott: Yeah, make it like, let me configure rock health, you know, damage, money, all those things.

1050
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:10,560
Scott: Yeah, but basically, if you can't tell, the game has this problem, right?

1051
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,740
Rym: Yeah, the multiplayer is pretty fun.

1052
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:16,640
Scott: Three rocks to the bottom, however you set up your defenses matters almost none at all.

1053
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:17,915
Scott: That's it.

1054
00:49:18,741 --> 00:49:21,020
Rym: Yup, and it's such potential, and I hope...

1055
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:25,797
Scott: Yeah, they had such a great idea, such great artistic execution, just bad balance.

1056
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,019
Scott: And the game rules.

1057
00:49:29,301 --> 00:49:34,080
Rym: Granted, they've had an update on September 9th, September 14th, and September 16th.

1058
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,918
Scott: So they're working on it, I guess.

1059
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,119
Rym: So hopefully they will keep making changes.

1060
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,158
Scott: But have they played it?

1061
00:49:39,002 --> 00:49:44,100
Rym: I don't know, I don't get... Maybe they might be in the... I've seen developers do this before.

1062
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:48,860
Rym: It's your game, you're really good at it, and so are the people you're playtesting with.

1063
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:52,860
Scott: Yeah, it's an indie game, so they probably don't have real testers, and they're probably not testing on real people.

1064
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,939
Rym: So they're probably setting up, you know, like the perfect defenses that only they know to do.

1065
00:49:57,282 --> 00:49:59,300
Rym: And they're so good at the game, they can build it very quickly.

1066
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:03,840
Rym: But the interface is not good enough for a normal player to build a good defense quickly.

1067
00:50:04,281 --> 00:50:06,880
Rym: Or an interesting defense in the amount of time and money you're given.

1068
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,720
Scott: That's another thing, it would be easier to set up the defenses with a mouse than with the gamepad, right?

1069
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:11,920
Scott: So, yeah.

1070
00:50:12,361 --> 00:50:14,559
Rym: Ah, but here's another flaw that really annoys me.

1071
00:50:14,781 --> 00:50:16,520
Rym: So I bought it on Steam, it's fine.

1072
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,380
Rym: But if I play it on my TV, I have to use the mouse to click on all the stupid menus.

1073
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,940
Scott: Yeah, we're controlling the game with the gamepad, which they support.

1074
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:28,159
Scott: But they don't allow you to control the game menus with the gamepad, what the hell?

1075
00:50:28,763 --> 00:50:29,360
Rym: WTF, mate!

1076
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:32,400
Scott: Even though it's a PC game, it's clearly a gamepad game.

1077
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:37,940
Scott: And if you're supporting gamepad, you need to support gamepad in the entire user interface, as well as the game itself.

1078
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,800
Scott: People can't be switching back between mouse and keyboard in gamepad.

1079
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,919
Scott: If they're using gamepad, they've probably got their computer hooked up to their TV.

1080
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:45,070
Scott: Anyway.

1081
00:50:46,521 --> 00:50:48,171
Rym: Now otherwise, I mean, cool stuff.

1082
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,895
Rym: they could do that.

1083
00:50:48,915 --> 00:50:49,760
Rym: I know they're not gonna do.

1084
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:54,740
Rym: But I'd love to see two on two, where one guy's bouldering constantly, and one guy's defending constantly.

1085
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:57,680
Scott: It doesn't seem like they did a lot of experimenting with the modes, right?

1086
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:02,760
Scott: Number one, in the regular mode, you know, multiplayer mode, is you can't really pick your characters.

1087
00:51:03,303 --> 00:51:03,412
Scott: Yeah.

1088
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,872
Scott: Not that the character matters, but you can't pick it.

1089
00:51:06,174 --> 00:51:07,120
Scott: All you can pick is the map.

1090
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,340
Rym: Granted, I would like the character to matter.

1091
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:10,785
Scott: I would like the character to matter.

1092
00:51:10,805 --> 00:51:14,360
Scott: Give each character a special power, advanced wars or magical drop style.

1093
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:14,716
Scott: Yeah.

1094
00:51:15,541 --> 00:51:19,620
Scott: Also, there's only one other multiplayer mode, which is skeeball mode.

1095
00:51:19,961 --> 00:51:21,399
Rym: Which is actually pretty fun.

1096
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,299
Scott: It's actually okay.

1097
00:51:22,501 --> 00:51:31,119
Rym: The problem is the scoring is kind of weighted, that you get minor amounts of points, basically negligible points, for hitting stuff on the way down, which also slows you down.

1098
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,900
Rym: Whoever gets to the skeeball at the end first, gets N times their score.

1099
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,807
Rym: So, for example, me and Rym roll down the hill, right?

1100
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:44,128
Scott: We both smash a bunch of stuff.

1101
00:51:44,189 --> 00:51:46,582
Scott: I get about 500 points, he gets about 600.

1102
00:51:46,582 --> 00:51:46,740
Scott: Alright.

1103
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:52,488
Scott: I make it to the bottom of the hill first, and I go into the big skeeball machine, and I land at number three.

1104
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:54,780
Scott: That means my score is multiplied by three.

1105
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:57,940
Rym: So my score is basically effectively rounded down to zero.

1106
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:06,340
Scott: Right, because my score is multiplied by three, his is multiplied by one, and whoever gets to the bottom of the hill first gets the multiplier and no one else does.

1107
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,445
Rym: Despite this, it worked out pretty well.

1108
00:52:07,545 --> 00:52:17,080
Rym: once we played it a few times, because you get three rolls, and the last several games we played at the beginning of the third roll, we were like neck and neck.

1109
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,199
Scott: Yeah, it actually sort of worked out.

1110
00:52:19,441 --> 00:52:20,280
Rym: My only complaint.

1111
00:52:20,501 --> 00:52:21,970
Scott: But we were pretty much just racing.

1112
00:52:22,011 --> 00:52:25,240
Scott: It was pretty much smash a couple things, then get to the hill first at the bottom.

1113
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,839
Rym: But thus, my only complaint about this mode.

1114
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,985
Rym: I want it to be configurable.

1115
00:52:30,065 --> 00:52:32,112
Rym: Pick how many rounds you do.

1116
00:52:32,433 --> 00:52:34,440
Rym: Pick what multipliers are available.

1117
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:37,239
Scott: Also, how cool would this be if you could have more than two rocks at once?

1118
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,298
Scott: Imagine there are five rocks going down the hill, right?

1119
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,600
Scott: And then only one guy gets the multiplier.

1120
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:43,643
Rym: Or you alternate.

1121
00:52:43,704 --> 00:52:47,360
Rym: Five rocks go, one guy is making a defense, and then you round rob him.

1122
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,820
Scott: I also think it would have been cooler if the stuff you smash is the multiplier.

1123
00:52:52,121 --> 00:52:57,200
Scott: So for example, every time you smash anything, your multiplier goes up by one.

1124
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:03,500
Scott: And then at the bottom, you go in the skee-ball, which is numbered one, two, three, four, five, or six, and you multiply the two numbers together.

1125
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,680
Scott: That would have been a much- and everyone gets to go in the skee-ball.

1126
00:53:08,262 --> 00:53:10,980
Rym: But there's got to be a major bonus for getting down first.

1127
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,660
Scott: Going first would just be X2 for that round.

1128
00:53:14,722 --> 00:53:27,760
Scott: So that way, the score, you still have an incentive to get there first, you still have an incentive to smash a lot of things, you still get a huge bonus for going in the right hole on the skee-ball, but you're still racing, so you're not taking your time to smash everything on the whole course.

1129
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:43,700
Scott: Plus, you can have the game end, as soon as the final guy gets in the skee-ball, then the game immediately ends, because that guy got the X2 on the final round, and now no one else can smash anything on that final roll.

1130
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:49,479
Scott: So if you, for example, were so slow, you're still doing your first roll, where people are on the sixth roll, then screw you.

1131
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,900
Scott: Also, it would be kind of cool if you could be more opportunities to bump people off the track.

1132
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:54,241
Rym: Yup.

1133
00:53:55,125 --> 00:53:57,859
Rym: But all that aside, I mean, those are all just, "Oh, hey, this is what I would

1134
00:53:57,899 --> 00:53:57,999
Rym: do.".

1135
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:14,620
Rym: I mean, it's not our game, but all they need to do, really, to take this game out of the, "Yeah, it's pretty fun," to the, like, serious, "We're playing this every other night," and caring about the outcome, would be to let us configure the parameters of multiplayer.

1136
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,006
Scott: Let us just mod it.

1137
00:54:16,227 --> 00:54:17,674
Scott: Let us make maps.

1138
00:54:18,117 --> 00:54:18,760
Scott: Let us make modes.

1139
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:34,860
Rym: Yeah, I wouldn't mind making maps, but really, really, all I need is, I want to be able to configure the amount of time I get to build, which comes down to how long it takes to make a rock, the damage rocks do when they hit the bottom, and the scaling of how much money everyone gets per round.

1140
00:54:35,061 --> 00:54:42,920
Scott: Also, oh, the one thing we didn't mention is, you get money, you know, and then you use the money to build defenses, but you can also use the money to buy a bigger rock.

1141
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,680
Scott: If you don't build defenses, you can use the money to buy a fancy rock.

1142
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,180
Rym: Bigger rock is kind of, like, dumb.

1143
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,840
Scott: The bigger rocks are pretty useless.

1144
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:52,880
Scott: Like, the spike rock and the lava rock really don't significantly help.

1145
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,849
Scott: It still takes three rocks to win.

1146
00:54:54,929 --> 00:54:57,120
Scott: I've bought the expensive rocks many times.

1147
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:58,940
Rym: There are higher-up rocks I've never used.

1148
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:00,660
Rym: Like, the one with wings, I don't know what it does.

1149
00:55:00,741 --> 00:55:06,879
Scott: Yeah, but it's like, I've bought the more expensive rocks, and it still took three rocks to win, so might as well use the small one.

1150
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:10,300
Rym: So, I guess, guys, you are close to greatness.

1151
00:55:10,662 --> 00:55:22,160
Rym: It's such a good concept, and you're so close, it would take so little to put this on my short list of games I play regularly, including such, you know, games as Counter-Strike and Natural Selection.

1152
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,579
Rym: You're literally, like, right there.

1153
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,900
Scott: Nah, they're good, but they're not that good.

1154
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,919
Rym: If they did, all the stuff we just said?

1155
00:55:31,162 --> 00:55:31,719
Scott: It'd be okay.

1156
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,176
Scott: I definitely play it a lot.

1157
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,996
Rym: You know what it'd be on the level of?

1158
00:55:35,016 --> 00:55:35,360
Rym: Ricochet.

1159
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,980
Scott: Yeah, Ricochet or The Hive, which is not a bad level to be on.

1160
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,400
Rym: Because that's a game I play regularly.

1161
00:55:40,581 --> 00:55:40,939
Scott: That's right.

1162
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:43,540
Rym: You could even up the price to, like, 15 bucks if you did all that stuff.

1163
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:44,260
Scott: That's for sure.

1164
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:44,488
Scott: Yeah.

1165
00:55:45,722 --> 00:55:46,439
Scott: Maybe they make a DLC.

1166
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:47,128
Rym: Maybe.

1167
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:48,343
Rym: They should.

1168
00:55:48,403 --> 00:55:50,540
Rym: Rock of More Ages.

1169
00:55:52,322 --> 00:55:53,099
Rym: Rocks of Ages.

1170
00:55:54,121 --> 00:55:55,358
Scott: Steel of Ages, I don't know.

1171
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,366
Rym: Bronze of Ages.

1172
00:55:57,829 --> 00:55:59,339
Rym: Rock of Bronze Age, I don't know.

1173
00:55:59,801 --> 00:56:01,099
Rym: You guys come up with a clever pun.

1174
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:01,580
Rym: Sure.

1175
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,660
Rym: I'm saying you guys like they're listening to GeekNights.

1176
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:04,657
Scott: Maybe they are.

1177
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,278
Scott: The listener might disagree.

1178
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,120
Scott: Let's link to their page and maybe they'll notice us.

1179
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,910
Rym: Maybe they'll notice, and then they'll listen to this part and be like, "Oh, how delightfully

1180
00:56:10,971 --> 00:56:11,173
Rym: meta!".

1181
00:56:12,131 --> 00:56:12,359
Scott: Yes.

1182
00:56:12,741 --> 00:56:13,299
Rym: You are quite.

1183
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:14,097
Scott: Quite.

1184
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:22,020
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1185
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:27,140
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1186
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:32,560
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1187
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,480
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1188
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:40,240
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1189
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:43,756
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1190
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:48,040
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1191
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:51,180
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
