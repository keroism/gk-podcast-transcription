00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,088
Rym: It's Wednesday, March 22nd, 2017.

2
00:00:12,088 --> 00:00:13,853
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,174 --> 00:00:16,299
Rym: I'm discuss and this is the GeekNights.

4
00:00:16,338 --> 00:00:19,032
Rym: tonight We're talking about Plutona number.

5
00:00:19,132 --> 00:00:19,835
Rym: Well all of them.

6
00:00:20,237 --> 00:00:20,800
Rym: We read the trade.

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,077
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:27,141 --> 00:00:29,713
Rym: So I had to make a day trip to Boston yesterday.

9
00:00:29,753 --> 00:00:31,160
Rym: That's why I broke two days ago.

10
00:00:31,542 --> 00:00:37,750
Rym: I've already spoiled that we're recording the show ahead cuz Scott said a Rangers game right now I'm in a Rangers game tomorrow.

11
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:44,036
Scott: Yeah, but as far as the context of the listener You're gonna probably upload this show post to the internet while I'm in the gat.

12
00:00:44,176 --> 00:00:45,120
Rym: that is in fact true.

13
00:00:45,702 --> 00:00:47,770
Rym: But so on Monday this week.

14
00:00:48,714 --> 00:00:50,100
Rym: I had to do a day trip to Boston.

15
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:51,167
Rym: so I took like the 8 a.m.

16
00:00:51,188 --> 00:00:54,484
Rym: Isella to Boston and I took the 520 p.m.

17
00:00:54,544 --> 00:00:56,071
Rym: Isella home from Boston like that.

18
00:00:56,292 --> 00:00:57,759
Rym: It's pretty easy to do a Boston day trip.

19
00:00:58,623 --> 00:01:04,491
Rym: My coworkers flew, but I feel like that is way more effort than There's a shuttle plane.

20
00:01:05,703 --> 00:01:08,500
Rym: There's a lot of shuttle planes that go between Boston to New York and the way those.

21
00:01:09,323 --> 00:01:15,298
Rym: so the way some of those work is you buy a ticket and you just show up at the airport and You just get on whichever one's next.

22
00:01:15,681 --> 00:01:19,983
Rym: So if you get lucky like you can just get on a plane and go but which airport in New York Did they leave from?

23
00:01:20,144 --> 00:01:23,420
Rym: most of them actually seem to go to Newark, right?

24
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,870
Scott: So the amount of time it takes me to Newark.

25
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:29,460
Rym: I could be that out of Boston I have a policy and my policy is I will not fly out of Newark.

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,348
Scott: I also don't fly out of Newark, but if I did by the time I would get there I'd be could be halfway to Boston.

27
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,340
Rym: Yeah, but the Isella is pretty good.

28
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,122
Rym: So I did that and I basically played a lot of a. I beat the necro dancer because I actually like tried to beat Krypto.

29
00:01:42,142 --> 00:01:53,778
Rym: the necro dancer like tried to finish it in so far as that has a plot the normal single-player Yeah, and there's way more than I thought because I beat the game and then it was like Oh now, you know the deal with the flute.

30
00:01:53,798 --> 00:02:01,300
Rym: now You have to play as the mom and it's way different and upside down castle What I don't even know about a mom or a flute, well, you never saw any cutscenes.

31
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,057
Rym: That means you've never beaten any part of that game.

32
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:04,522
Scott: I've be.

33
00:02:04,662 --> 00:02:09,740
Rym: you get a cutscene of like my mom disappeared and then every time you beat another level you get more cutscenes.

34
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,666
Scott: I've beaten things in that game.

35
00:02:11,806 --> 00:02:20,331
Scott: in so far as I there were staircases and I went down and that means I'd be level No, yeah, there's four of those and a boss in every like area.

36
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:21,835
Scott: I've never gotten to a boss.

37
00:02:21,956 --> 00:02:26,388
Scott: What I don't think you've The thing is like it's not like I've tried.

38
00:02:26,428 --> 00:02:33,060
Scott: if you've played less than five percent of that game I put in like almost no effort into playing that game and then stop playing.

39
00:02:33,082 --> 00:02:36,072
Scott: So yeah If you beat the I'm sure if I tried I would get to a boss.

40
00:02:36,213 --> 00:02:40,610
Rym: if you beat all four Bosses by beating all four levels only four bosses.

41
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:45,463
Rym: All right, then you get to fight the necro dancer Which is a crazy like.

42
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:46,465
Rym: not what you expect.

43
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:46,866
Rym: fight.

44
00:02:46,946 --> 00:02:48,108
Scott: Wouldn't it be some sort of?

45
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:51,976
Scott: you know Dancing Necromancer?

46
00:02:52,056 --> 00:02:54,189
Rym: that is exactly what the necro dancer is.

47
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,167
Scott: Yeah, if you couldn't get nominative determinism dances and then things come back from the dead.

48
00:02:58,247 --> 00:03:05,570
Rym: as he dances Yeah He's literally summoning the undead and dancing around you and you and your dad have to kill him together and it's a puzzle.

49
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,510
Rym: It's really good, but then you become the mom and there's all this stuff.

50
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,884
Rym: So there's a lot more to that game than I realize was the necro dancing.

51
00:03:13,346 --> 00:03:16,517
Scott: I'm not gonna spoil it I'm pretty sure mom was the necro dancer.

52
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:20,510
Rym: Uh, no, actually no, I'll spoil that your mom is nothing.

53
00:03:20,854 --> 00:03:22,450
Scott: I was dead and is now brought back to life.

54
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:27,810
Rym: Yeah You do bring your mom back to life with the loot and then your and then you find out that the loot is bad news.

55
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,477
Scott: Maybe I thought you said flute loot.

56
00:03:29,778 --> 00:03:32,450
Rym: Oh, okay, you know the loot the plot.

57
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:33,737
Rym: I guess you've never seen a cutscene.

58
00:03:33,757 --> 00:03:36,049
Scott: So you have no a loot the instrument not loot.

59
00:03:36,451 --> 00:03:40,569
Rym: No, no, no, though the loot is loot and now I am using the loot as my weapon.

60
00:03:41,515 --> 00:03:41,977
Scott: But it's not.

61
00:03:42,058 --> 00:03:45,596
Scott: it's not a bag with a dollar sign on it No, it is a golden loot.

62
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:55,185
Rym: It's a thing with strings on is a golden loot that raises the dead I guess but you have to keep playing it or they die again, I guess anyway, the stuff going on.

63
00:03:55,488 --> 00:04:02,170
Rym: but So I get to Boston and I'm there basically to have like one meeting and then one more important meeting.

64
00:04:02,712 --> 00:04:10,310
Rym: So I show up at the place that people are gonna meet me and my meeting or the important important meeting and the people are Supposed to meet me at it are running late.

65
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,990
Rym: So they're like just go in and like, you know stall slash work your magic cuz I'm good at this stuff.

66
00:04:15,111 --> 00:04:17,021
Rym: So I got I'm like, alright fine.

67
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:17,584
Rym: I'll just go in.

68
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:21,502
Rym: so I walk over to the address They gave me and I can't find the building.

69
00:04:21,522 --> 00:04:27,003
Rym: Alright, so I'm like, oh Yep, so maybe I'm dumb.

70
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:28,049
Rym: It's a square.

71
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:28,872
Scott: What is Google Maps?

72
00:04:29,013 --> 00:04:33,770
Rym: a Google Maps puts a pin in a spot and I go there and a different addresses at that spot.

73
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,590
Rym: Okay, but the number like I'm going to like six and the number there is ten.

74
00:04:39,335 --> 00:04:41,150
Rym: So I go in one direction I see twelve.

75
00:04:42,853 --> 00:04:43,496
Rym: So we'll get to that.

76
00:04:43,536 --> 00:04:44,360
Rym: so I go a little bit.

77
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:54,721
Rym: in one direction I see twelve and I'm like, aha I'll go the other way and the next building if we go the other way is one One and then twelve and ten and there are no other.

78
00:04:54,782 --> 00:04:57,110
Scott: I mean I've had situations like that in New York on occasion.

79
00:04:57,271 --> 00:04:59,470
Scott: Yeah, that happens in other places much more.

80
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:03,866
Rym: So so I go into the building at ten and I'm like yo, where's six?

81
00:05:04,006 --> 00:05:06,860
Rym: and I expect the guy to say Oh go blah, haha.

82
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,402
Rym: It's weird.

83
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:13,164
Rym: So the guy says six There's no six and then he calls another guy over like you ever hear of six?

84
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,615
Rym: and the guy's like six There's no.

85
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,448
Scott: say whoever gave you the addresses wrong.

86
00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:25,970
Rym: Yep So I'm like well is such and such company in this building and they're like Let me check takes a surprising amount of time for him to poke at a computer monsters building.

87
00:05:26,331 --> 00:05:28,621
Rym: I was a bit it's a real building like a New York building.

88
00:05:29,124 --> 00:05:30,470
Rym: and then he's like now they ain't in here.

89
00:05:31,212 --> 00:05:35,284
Rym: So I go to one and they're like there is definitely no six.

90
00:05:35,825 --> 00:05:37,370
Scott: well, is there could that company in the building?

91
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,469
Scott: No, okay.

92
00:05:38,855 --> 00:05:39,546
Rym: So I call my.

93
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:46,330
Rym: well I call my late co-workers who are still late because they were like way out in fucking Because they can't find six evening.

94
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:53,168
Rym: No, cuz they're way out in Cambridge and they think it's a way shorter drive to downtown Boston than it is.

95
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:59,770
Rym: So I called them back and they're like six doesn't exist and they're like our uber driver says it does.

96
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,483
Rym: He's taking us right there and I was like, alright, I'll meet you there.

97
00:06:03,503 --> 00:06:04,246
Rym: Mm-hmm.

98
00:06:04,427 --> 00:06:05,290
Rym: There was no six.

99
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:10,949
Rym: No, they gave us the wrong meeting and by then that was important meeting and by then it was too late.

100
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:18,339
Rym: no, luckily they gave us the wrong address and Yeah, so I just went home having done basically nothing.

101
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:21,750
Scott: So I basically at least get a secret breakfast.

102
00:06:22,871 --> 00:06:25,022
Rym: No, cuz that's way over by Back Bay and I was over.

103
00:06:25,062 --> 00:06:28,270
Scott: but if you're there why you're great At least make it worth the trip.

104
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:31,080
Rym: I went to a different but pretty good restaurant.

105
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:38,370
Rym: cuz I'm on a business trip technically so sure I had very well someone else's money and I just basically does that's one steak place.

106
00:06:38,793 --> 00:06:40,590
Rym: Yeah, I fucked around in Boston all day.

107
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,250
Rym: Then I took the train home and I played a whole bunch of knicker dancer.

108
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:47,406
Rym: That is why I now know what the deal is with the knicker dancer.

109
00:06:47,426 --> 00:06:49,775
Rym: That was my day And that's why there was no show on Monday.

110
00:06:49,795 --> 00:06:51,542
Scott: All right, let's do actual stuff.

111
00:06:51,562 --> 00:06:52,566
Scott: So it's any news.

112
00:06:52,887 --> 00:06:57,946
Scott: Yeah, so Just a tiny news, there's that show free the swimming hot boys show.

113
00:06:57,966 --> 00:07:00,055
Rym: Oh, yeah I watched that she said was good.

114
00:07:00,236 --> 00:07:08,284
Scott: I never watched it because I'm watching a bicycle show Which is slightly less hotness, but slightly more humor, but still hotness.

115
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:10,169
Scott: Yeah bicycling instead of swimming.

116
00:07:11,032 --> 00:07:13,542
Scott: But anyway, oh and y'all pedal has a new season right now.

117
00:07:13,582 --> 00:07:15,710
Rym: So anyway, so how far are they?

118
00:07:16,192 --> 00:07:17,789
Rym: How many episodes per bike race?

119
00:07:19,692 --> 00:07:21,782
Scott: So far it's really just like lead-up races.

120
00:07:22,285 --> 00:07:23,913
Scott: so there was just a race I just watched.

121
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:24,676
Scott: that was two episodes.

122
00:07:25,037 --> 00:07:28,030
Scott: Oh see at least initial didn't even take up both episodes.

123
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,704
Rym: Initial D the lead-up would be like a couple episodes.

124
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:36,630
Scott: Well, cuz really in your pedal It's really there's only one race that matters which is the inter high, right?

125
00:07:36,971 --> 00:07:42,336
Scott: and all these other races are just like sort of setting this the Scene for the big race.

126
00:07:42,557 --> 00:07:44,906
Scott: the big race has only happened once so far.

127
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:51,909
Scott: It's gonna happen three times I assume because it's high school three years in Japan of high school and the first the first season was a lead-up.

128
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,561
Scott: So the first inter high which took up the entire second season.

129
00:07:55,802 --> 00:07:58,110
Scott: Yeah, and then now we're in the third season.

130
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,327
Scott: So we're leading up to the second inter high which I assume will take up the entire third season.

131
00:08:02,568 --> 00:08:14,490
Scott: All right Anyway but they're making compilation movies for free and you the the swimming show and usually when there's compilation movies for something like there were for your pedal actually.

132
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:17,744
Scott: Or I'm like, yeah, why do they keep making these things?

133
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,290
Scott: I seen the TV series.

134
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,723
Scott: Why do I want to see the condensed compilation thing?

135
00:08:21,763 --> 00:08:23,150
Scott: Just give me new content instead.

136
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:26,395
Rym: Yeah, I've never been happy with compilation movies But now it's like.

137
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,528
Scott: this is the first time where I've been like Oh They made compilation movies for the thing that I slightly maybe want to see but don't super want to see.

138
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:35,230
Scott: it's like.

139
00:08:35,692 --> 00:08:36,837
Scott: That's actually really useful.

140
00:08:36,857 --> 00:08:39,568
Scott: I'm gonna watch those compilation movies for free and not watch free.

141
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,669
Rym: So, I mean, I know freeze good.

142
00:08:42,943 --> 00:08:48,070
Scott: Yeah Please make compilation movies for the ice skating one that I want to see but don't want to watch all the episodes.

143
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:50,400
Rym: I feel like I should just watch that one straight up.

144
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:51,385
Scott: It's on the borderline.

145
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:55,054
Scott: It's definitely definitely Dragon.

146
00:08:55,115 --> 00:08:57,005
Rym: I think I can watch the ice skating show.

147
00:08:57,126 --> 00:09:02,650
Scott: I didn't watch all of Let's made dragon if it weren't for this podcast.

148
00:09:03,072 --> 00:09:07,650
Rym: Yeah, and now I'm still there's a lot of you know in Civ 5 the religions.

149
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:12,290
Rym: There's like pressure from different religions on cities and the number goes up in danger from different animes.

150
00:09:12,431 --> 00:09:14,767
Rym: There's a lot of pressure from that kimono friends on me.

151
00:09:14,807 --> 00:09:18,680
Rym: right now Numerous angles are pushing kimono friends on me hard.

152
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,402
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

153
00:09:19,523 --> 00:09:21,590
Scott: yeah the ice skating shows on the borderline of like.

154
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,029
Scott: But if there are compilation movies I'd watch them like as soon as I got home.

155
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:40,089
Scott: But now so the New York Children's Film Festival is in New York as it is every year And usually we go to the premiere movie, which this year was your name, which Rym saw I saw a long time ago on a plane by chance.

156
00:09:40,572 --> 00:09:49,368
Rym: yeah, cuz the flight I was on was basically it had all these Japanese movies with Theatrical English subtitles, but anyway that movie was like the highest grossing.

157
00:09:49,931 --> 00:09:50,071
Scott: Think.

158
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:53,102
Scott: it beat spirited away in some category of grossing money.

159
00:09:53,122 --> 00:09:55,390
Rym: It's his best work.

160
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,638
Scott: I think it's Makoto Shinkai the cloud guy.

161
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:58,642
Scott: Yeah, Hoshinoko.

162
00:09:58,763 --> 00:10:00,249
Scott: It is five centimeters per second.

163
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:01,779
Rym: Yeah It's it's.

164
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,255
Scott: it's a movie by him, but yeah We're gonna see that.

165
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:05,421
Scott: it's gonna be in theaters.

166
00:10:05,502 --> 00:10:07,693
Scott: regular like it was good enough I will.

167
00:10:08,176 --> 00:10:09,705
Rym: I will watch it again in a few weeks.

168
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:10,670
Scott: We're gonna go see that for real.

169
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,743
Scott: We couldn't see it at the premiere of the Children's Film Festival because it sold out.

170
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:23,870
Scott: the closing movie Of the Children's Film Festival was on CN Which is looks like the word ancient with the T removed from the end and the magic tablet.

171
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:31,766
Scott: So we couldn't get tickets to that either even though Kenji Kamiyama The director was gonna and the writer also was gonna be at that final screening.

172
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:32,550
Scott: cuz that sold out.

173
00:10:33,891 --> 00:10:37,761
Scott: Kenji Kamiyama, by the way is the guy who directed goes in the shell standalone complex.

174
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:38,383
Rym: Yeah.

175
00:10:38,443 --> 00:10:39,125
Rym: Did he also?

176
00:10:39,185 --> 00:10:40,669
Rym: didn't he actually like, right?

177
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,163
Rym: Even in the East, I don't know.

178
00:10:43,203 --> 00:10:48,343
Rym: he's done a lot of stuff But anyway, pretty sure he wrote that was why it's so as such a bad ending.

179
00:10:48,544 --> 00:10:51,467
Rym: Yeah written by Kenji Kamiyama Okay, so production IG.

180
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:57,587
Scott: But anyway, he wrote and directed and production IG produced this movie on CN and the magic tablet.

181
00:10:57,687 --> 00:10:58,670
Scott: Rym wasn't in town.

182
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:05,650
Rym: I I thought until just now that this meant like magic tablet of fantasy.

183
00:11:05,811 --> 00:11:06,856
Scott: I knew nothing about this.

184
00:11:06,936 --> 00:11:14,940
Scott: I thought it also meant a magic tablet as in Ten Commandments tablet Exactly, but that's not the kind of tablet.

185
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,522
Scott: It is at all.

186
00:11:15,582 --> 00:11:20,697
Scott: Me me Emily and Judith went to see this and It's a nice movie.

187
00:11:20,858 --> 00:11:22,849
Scott: It's not like epic or the best.

188
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:29,068
Scott: the kind of tablet they're talking about is the iPad kind not the Not the other kind.

189
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:34,810
Scott: And just to give you a quick summary I'm sure Rym will see this at some point and we'll do a real episode on it.

190
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,395
Scott: But what this movie is?

191
00:11:36,435 --> 00:11:49,949
Scott: you got this girl and when she dreams she's dreaming about this sort of Fantasy steampunk ish world where there's a princess and a king and this world is a parallel of this Drama that's going on in the real world.

192
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:56,866
Scott: Like there are people in the real world and they have character analogues in the magic world and vice-versa.

193
00:11:56,906 --> 00:12:03,330
Scott: and stuff happens in the magic World and then that same thing seem to have a you know analogous happening in the real world, right?

194
00:12:03,511 --> 00:12:05,330
Scott: And it's sort of that weird thing is going on.

195
00:12:06,755 --> 00:12:09,689
Scott: but also It's about self-driving cars.

196
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:28,870
Scott: well, and it's also about the Tokyo Olympics and it's about the drama of a small-town person versus Tokyo life and Family a small-town first person versus Tokyo life is also the plot of your name degree and family dramas.

197
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:35,450
Scott: Big, you know the kind of family dramas where you know, it's like, you know, uh, you know mom's dad.

198
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:43,170
Scott: Mom is dead and grandpa's mad at dad, you know, they don't talk they're estranged kind of thing, you know, that sort of thing.

199
00:12:43,314 --> 00:12:46,298
Scott: Yeah You know the mystery of like.

200
00:12:46,318 --> 00:12:47,424
Scott: I didn't know anything about mom.

201
00:12:47,444 --> 00:12:48,530
Scott: dad never told me anything.

202
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,536
Scott: I don't know what the deal is.

203
00:12:49,556 --> 00:12:50,361
Scott: Let's find out.

204
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:51,770
Rym: she's from the magic place.

205
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,857
Rym: That's what a style or something.

206
00:12:53,877 --> 00:12:56,626
Scott: So that's that's what this is and it you know, it's not bad.

207
00:12:56,706 --> 00:12:57,810
Scott: It's a good anime movie.

208
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,438
Scott: It's worth watching once.

209
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:01,389
Scott: I just don't think it's worth watching more than once.

210
00:13:02,592 --> 00:13:09,670
Scott: And I think the main problem with it is it has a lot of scenes that are just sort of like paced wrong.

211
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:10,898
Scott: It's a two-hour movie.

212
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,348
Scott: It should have definitely been 90 minutes.

213
00:13:13,515 --> 00:13:25,516
Scott: it was and the one that really stood out is like there's a scene where like they're You guys running upstairs and it shows you him running up the stairs and it's like they could have cut the number of flights They showed you In half.

214
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:31,610
Rym: Yeah, I feel like you can only get away with that if you're oh she making sky crawlers, right?

215
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:37,967
Scott: But so he's running up the stairs in this action scene and he runs and it's like you're ready for him to be at the Top and he runs up some more stairs.

216
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:42,090
Scott: It's like they loop that like for like five to ten seconds too long.

217
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:46,050
Rym: You should just turn that into us that I own me mokushiro, but there's a lot of thing.

218
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,887
Scott: It doesn't fit it, but there's other things like they're driving.

219
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:53,390
Scott: at one point It's like the driving shot lasts 30 seconds to a minute too long.

220
00:13:53,511 --> 00:14:00,825
Rym: Yeah, your name is pretty long too, but at least it like is Constantly novel and you're constantly wondering what's gonna happen.

221
00:14:01,025 --> 00:14:02,250
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of stuff like that.

222
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:06,010
Scott: So there's a chase scene and the things keep happening in the chase scene.

223
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:13,637
Scott: It's not just like a static repeat shot, but the chase scene itself could have been half as long and accomplished the same You know effect, right?

224
00:14:13,657 --> 00:14:15,710
Scott: So that's the the main flaw of the movie.

225
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:20,490
Scott: So if you got time to watch an anime movie go watch that stand in the magic tablet.

226
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,397
Rym: We generally say watch every anime movie.

227
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:23,119
Rym: there aren't that many.

228
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:25,387
Scott: there aren't that many that aren't Pokemon the movie 30.

229
00:14:25,387 --> 00:14:28,947
Scott: Yep But don't go in a rush to go see it.

230
00:14:29,751 --> 00:14:36,230
Rym: So cartoon saloon, which you should probably know from the secret of Kells and song of the sea.

231
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:43,510
Rym: You know Tom Moore's a studio the premiere Irish animation studio that is so far with their two feature films.

232
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,643
Scott: They only hit home run.

233
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:55,037
Rym: Yeah Literally two feature films two home runs and now we have a trailer for their third feature film Dun-dun-dun wolf walkers.

234
00:14:55,378 --> 00:14:57,044
Scott: Oh, baby, which looks.

235
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,950
Rym: I'm just gonna link to the tray the teaser trailer.

236
00:14:59,091 --> 00:15:03,729
Rym: It was very little other than that probably about werewolves.

237
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,842
Rym: Looks real freaking good.

238
00:15:06,863 --> 00:15:07,929
Scott: I mean, how could it not look?

239
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:10,055
Scott: I'm only hit home run.

240
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,990
Rym: I mean I've met Tom for like twice and it's like seen him talk.

241
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:18,510
Scott: Even if you tried to intentionally walk right he'd read they reach out and hit the home run anyway.

242
00:15:18,554 --> 00:15:20,835
Scott: Yeah I mean secret of cows Wrong that?

243
00:15:20,955 --> 00:15:25,815
Rym: and if you read the production history like it is amazing that secretive Kells Was even made.

244
00:15:26,117 --> 00:15:28,245
Rym: and if you're wondering why it kind of ends is sort of.

245
00:15:28,546 --> 00:15:32,989
Rym: I don't want to say it Peters out But it ends in the sort of melancholy and long dinner mom.

246
00:15:33,612 --> 00:15:35,559
Rym: There's a production reason for that.

247
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:46,885
Scott: like it would have been a very different movie if they had funding but it's thanks to that Success of that secretive Kells that they were able to continue and make the other stuff much similar to the story of Makoto Shinkai Who made anime in his basement.

248
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:47,390
Scott: that somehow?

249
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,361
Scott: Succeeded and thus was able to eventually make your name.

250
00:15:50,381 --> 00:15:54,058
Rym: and I checked to make sure cuz I'm still amazed Despite the weirdness of that thing.

251
00:15:54,098 --> 00:15:55,043
Scott: We saw at the New York Comic Con.

252
00:15:55,083 --> 00:16:10,550
Scott: I don't even remember the name of that movie He made but meh Ancient in the magic tablet is way better than that Makoto Shinkai movie One with the fantasy world people who play chase distant Ghibli movies through the whispers of darkness or something.

253
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,414
Scott: Yeah, whatever that was.

254
00:16:11,434 --> 00:16:11,534
Rym: Yeah.

255
00:16:11,996 --> 00:16:24,350
Rym: Yeah wolf walkers just looks real real good And I'm pretty confident that they'll bat a thousand and somehow If any of you follow me on Twitter, you know what my Twitter's like, he hasn't unfollowed me on Twitter.

256
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:27,670
Rym: So either he doesn't read his Twitter or he's into the Sonic the Hedgehog.

257
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:32,474
Scott: No, I think he's one of those people who doesn't read his Twitter cuz he think he's following like thousands of people Under 2,000.

258
00:16:32,474 --> 00:16:33,037
Rym: Yeah.

259
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:33,681
Scott: Okay.

260
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:34,224
Scott: You can't follow that.

261
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:35,350
Scott: How many people am I following?

262
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,120
Rym: I'm following cuz I actually I got a. I'm gonna.

263
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,501
Rym: I'm doing.

264
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,284
Scott: I'm gonna always tell.

265
00:16:41,324 --> 00:16:43,250
Scott: have someone reads Twitter based on the?

266
00:16:44,411 --> 00:16:51,830
Rym: I'll say this definitely if you have more than 2,000 people you are following either You're an insane person who actually uses lists or you're not reading Twitter.

267
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:55,050
Rym: Yeah, I'm following 357 and I'm actually gonna cut that back a little bit.

268
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,870
Scott: I'm sure a lot of the people I'm following just don't tweet at all is the thing.

269
00:16:58,211 --> 00:17:06,503
Rym: Yep, a few people are tweeting a lot and the problem is I really like what they're tweeting a lot But they treat too much like and you think that I tweet too much.

270
00:17:06,724 --> 00:17:08,031
Rym: These people are pushing I.

271
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:11,327
Scott: there are a lot of people that I like what they tweet, but they tweet too much.

272
00:17:11,347 --> 00:17:11,909
Scott: So I mute them.

273
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:20,730
Rym: Yeah, if I feel like I can't unfollow them, of course lately Most of it's been retweets of that meme of an unrelated thing and be like cowboy bebop.

274
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,150
Scott: And then what always happens is I'll mute someone right?

275
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:28,817
Scott: It's like I'll mute someone and then you'll also follow them and you'll know that you'll at them And I'll see that tweet.

276
00:17:28,918 --> 00:17:41,899
Rym: Yeah, and then it's just like no Sometimes it's good though, because then you get the Conversation you would have otherwise seen unless it turns into one of those like 400 tweet arguments Which is the kind of thing I muted you for.

277
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:52,260
Rym: yeah Well anyway things of the day.

278
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:58,339
Rym: So I saw this on my Twitter and I'm not gonna link to a tweet thread, but instead I'll link to this page.

279
00:17:58,862 --> 00:18:15,140
Rym: Well from a choir University in Australia of all places that Showed some of them, but if you didn't know, you know The Ides of March is literally just the middle of March and that's when Caesar was stabbed to death by everybody Kind of instigated by Brutus, you know, you I hope you know a little bit of Roman history.

280
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:21,952
Scott: I hope I mean if you know anything about Roman history, you know that it to The first thing you know about Roman history.

281
00:18:22,032 --> 00:18:30,860
Rym: Yeah many people the only thing Yep, maybe you know about like wolves and like mythical Rome, but but uh, are you gonna Brute me?

282
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:33,358
Scott: So, uh, no, you're not cuz I'm gonna Brute you.

283
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:43,372
Rym: So what most people don't know is that Brutus had One of the more badass coins in history.

284
00:18:43,693 --> 00:18:50,800
Rym: This is like I don't know You know, we had Caesar stabbed to death and participated in said stabbing and he had coined.

285
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:58,220
Scott: Basically The thing I don't actually know right is like, you know, there's that famous thing where Caesar was like you too Brutus.

286
00:18:58,361 --> 00:18:59,511
Scott: Oh, yeah, right.

287
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:03,185
Scott: was Brutus actually Caesar's friend and then turned on him?

288
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:06,677
Scott: or was Brutus just pretending to be Caesar's friend the whole time?

289
00:19:06,717 --> 00:19:07,440
Scott: and was that evil?

290
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:08,423
Rym: The J?

291
00:19:08,443 --> 00:19:18,560
Rym: because the general narrative was that the people who portrayed Caesar were worried that the power of the Senate was going to be Displaced into a dictatorship and that Caesar was going to become a dynastic King.

292
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,845
Scott: I'm talking about Brutus job.

293
00:19:19,865 --> 00:19:22,293
Scott: Was he actually friends with Julius or?

294
00:19:22,313 --> 00:19:24,180
Rym: I don't know about their personal stuff.

295
00:19:24,281 --> 00:19:26,035
Scott: That's the part that I'm asking about.

296
00:19:26,056 --> 00:19:26,580
Scott: I know the part.

297
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:36,111
Rym: Yeah, right, but this coin on the front is just a fucking picture of Brutus Which apparently was not something they would do in that era.

298
00:19:36,151 --> 00:19:38,540
Rym: that was seen as very full of hubris.

299
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:44,946
Rym: Yeah, perhaps also to harken back to again Kings the thing that Brutus was essentially against Yeah, and the back of it.

300
00:19:45,307 --> 00:19:48,320
Rym: It just says Ides of March and it's two fucking knives.

301
00:19:48,841 --> 00:19:50,787
Scott: Yeah, though or a bowl.

302
00:19:50,868 --> 00:19:57,160
Rym: I can't so according to the Twitter where someone was like, okay Let's talk about Brutus's fucking coin.

303
00:19:57,721 --> 00:20:04,900
Rym: That cap is a particular kind of cap that was worn by a slave who was undergoing many a slave who was being freed.

304
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:24,279
Scott: Essentially two knives freed slaves Ides of March picture of Brutus That's basically a stabbed Rym and then sold geek knights t-shirts or the picture of me stabbing Rym and on the back It's just two knives and it said no more annoying noises Or had picture of some earmuffs.

305
00:20:26,104 --> 00:20:28,059
Rym: So remember this on the Ides of March.

306
00:20:30,322 --> 00:20:31,105
Scott: So check this out.

307
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:40,720
Scott: there's an anime an anime that I have not watched and don't plan to watch called Hidamari sketch and there's a song from Hidamari sketch called sketch switch.

308
00:20:41,883 --> 00:20:52,450
Scott: somebody took that song and Mashed it up with the song black and yellow by Wiz Khalifa and they produced this little video Which is my thing of the day.

309
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,179
Scott: it is on the YouTube.

310
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,539
Rym: Enjoy, what's telling is that I started playing it cuz.

311
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:04,679
Rym: Scott You know gave me his thing of the day and I think you you pointed out that I clicked like within about three seconds of It starting like like before you even heard anything.

312
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,599
Scott: You just like you open the link like maybe five seconds and you click like there is.

313
00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:11,851
Scott: you know You paused it shortly after.

314
00:21:11,912 --> 00:21:12,877
Scott: you're only at 21 seconds.

315
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:20,326
Scott: Yeah, I've been 21 seconds on this here from here, but you click like way before that 21 second I'm confident clicks pause.

316
00:21:20,628 --> 00:21:23,479
Rym: the rest of those four minutes, you know are pretty good.

317
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:29,040
Rym: I'm also confident that these recommended related videos are almost all going to be great.

318
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,883
Scott: What kind of video?

319
00:21:29,903 --> 00:21:31,771
Scott: give me a name of the was in those recommended?

320
00:21:31,831 --> 00:21:32,554
Rym: first M&M.

321
00:21:32,574 --> 00:21:45,122
Rym: All right, bustin I think that's just because I think this is you the sampling of deaf Punk a video platinum level circulation Avicii.

322
00:21:45,443 --> 00:21:47,749
Rym: it looks like another anime mashup of some kind.

323
00:21:47,829 --> 00:21:51,238
Rym: Okay, another anime unwrapping mashup of some kind.

324
00:21:51,258 --> 00:21:58,967
Rym: Okay Hey pops plus animes equals Dang mao die.

325
00:21:59,007 --> 00:22:05,353
Rym: Yeah, there's good stuff in here and Platinum spice which I'm probably not gonna click on but this one is particularly choice.

326
00:22:05,373 --> 00:22:09,147
Rym: This is good stuff in the moment We were at PAX East.

327
00:22:09,187 --> 00:22:12,680
Rym: I'm gonna try to have the panel up pretty soon the new brand new winning panel.

328
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:18,775
Rym: I think our next con is thank icon which Scott probably will bail out because he sucks.

329
00:22:18,975 --> 00:22:20,218
Scott: What day is it?

330
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:20,840
Rym: and April?

331
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,004
Rym: Nope, not half a month from now.

332
00:22:23,284 --> 00:22:25,210
Rym: Yeah, I'll be there doing a few panels.

333
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:29,647
Rym: I assume I haven't really done much preparation But I'll be there.

334
00:22:30,654 --> 00:22:31,480
Rym: if you want to see the stuff.

335
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,480
Rym: I would have run it out of my Boston if we hadn't bailed on anime Boston if I do it as thank icon.

336
00:22:35,901 --> 00:22:38,710
Scott: Yeah, are we actually gonna start doing anime season whatever?

337
00:22:38,731 --> 00:22:41,580
Rym: I feel like we'll just start doing the anime season whatever on YouTube.

338
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,890
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna prepare it.

339
00:22:43,052 --> 00:22:47,030
Scott: I feel like we should live Anime Boston time now, which is yeah, I usually do it.

340
00:22:47,071 --> 00:22:49,680
Scott: So I'm gonna prepare one as if it was anime Boston.

341
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,060
Rym: Yep, we'll do it on YouTube because we have at least for the time being bailed on my Boston.

342
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:59,009
Rym: We're gonna turn our like best anime Boston panel into just a YouTube show.

343
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:07,449
Scott: that we'll do Because we might need.

344
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,879
Scott: we need some advice about the dates.

345
00:23:09,261 --> 00:23:10,004
Scott: so here's the thing.

346
00:23:10,024 --> 00:23:24,514
Scott: what we do is we would go to the anime chart for each for the Next season and we would just look only at the picture and the text and we would with complete prejudice judge Every one of those things on the chart to prepare people for the next season.

347
00:23:24,574 --> 00:23:26,480
Scott: and we were usually like 90 plus percent.

348
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,280
Rym: Yeah, the first year we did it we put we video that shit and it's on YouTube.

349
00:23:30,822 --> 00:23:31,363
Rym: The only

350
00:23:31,423 --> 00:23:31,764
Scott: thing

351
00:23:32,065 --> 00:23:35,976
Rym: the only thing we were wrong about is we thought Sailor Moon Crystal was gonna be great

352
00:23:36,277 --> 00:23:46,934
Scott: anyway, so We need to know if we do this four times a year once for the fall winter spring summer seasons of anime What date would be best for each season right?

353
00:23:46,974 --> 00:23:48,240
Scott: It's like what is the like?

354
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,214
Scott: What is the day ideally when for example, I guess it's current.

355
00:23:51,234 --> 00:23:52,440
Scott: It's about to be spring, right?

356
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,984
Scott: So we're gonna do spring season.

357
00:23:54,485 --> 00:23:56,332
Scott: spring season of anime hasn't started yet, right?

358
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,378
Scott: Yeah, or is it summer season?

359
00:23:58,398 --> 00:23:58,800
Scott: That's next?

360
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,422
Scott: I don't know.

361
00:23:59,442 --> 00:24:01,591
Scott: But anyway, I don't think about it.

362
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:03,378
Rym: I yeah, I get the pressure of.

363
00:24:03,398 --> 00:24:04,823
Rym: hey Everyone's talking about this.

364
00:24:04,963 --> 00:24:14,960
Scott: We want to do this when the chart is at its fullest, right when it's most complete So before the show's done before the shows start airing and we get too much information.

365
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:19,680
Scott: So like what is the date for the summer season when the chart is fullest, but the shows haven't started yet?

366
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,600
Scott: What is the date for the fall season when the chart is most complete, but the fall shows haven't started airing yet?

367
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:28,699
Scott: Send us those dates Approximately so we know when to produce this show.

368
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:34,655
Rym: Yep, the other con that we will be at is Kinetic Con July 7th 8th and 9th in Hartford, Connecticut.

369
00:24:34,735 --> 00:24:36,300
Rym: as you know, we are run.

370
00:24:37,383 --> 00:24:39,700
Rym: We run the entire panels department there.

371
00:24:41,002 --> 00:24:46,480
Scott: It still closes at 9 p.m So we can go to bed.

372
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,713
Scott: I enjoy being at Kinetic Con also.

373
00:24:50,462 --> 00:24:54,860
Rym: It's the only place that a lot of people can run panels that aren't anime or games.

374
00:24:55,121 --> 00:25:01,823
Rym: It's true and like there is content at Kinetic Con that literally will not be at any other Conventions.

375
00:25:01,843 --> 00:25:03,209
Scott: Kinetic Con doesn't restrict itself.

376
00:25:03,229 --> 00:25:05,420
Scott: They don't know they don't pretend they don't say they're an anime con.

377
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,349
Scott: They're like, look, we're just the geek con in Connecticut.

378
00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:08,012
Scott: We do everything.

379
00:25:08,033 --> 00:25:08,254
Scott: Yeah.

380
00:25:08,575 --> 00:25:09,500
Rym: Anime is like less.

381
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,067
Scott: If it's geeky we do it.

382
00:25:11,248 --> 00:25:13,900
Rym: Anime content's been dropping because no one fucking submits it anymore.

383
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:28,677
Rym: so actually a lot of our content is literary and game related and music related and I think the example I always give is one of the one of one panel that Staffer used to run was literally just I mush with dogs like in Alaska.

384
00:25:28,758 --> 00:25:31,646
Rym: having that guy I don't know hasn't been submitted in a while.

385
00:25:32,248 --> 00:25:39,258
Rym: So I yeah, we'll be at Kinetic Con if you were staffed with us last year Do the thing in the email I sent you.

386
00:25:40,702 --> 00:25:46,030
Rym: And if you want to submit a panel go to the website and submit the panel because I'm literally Scheduling the con right now.

387
00:25:46,634 --> 00:25:55,110
Rym: like it's happening I'm gonna try to have the whole schedule filled out like before the end of April Oh, and I'm playing Zelda like every smart person.

388
00:25:55,130 --> 00:26:00,307
Scott: Oh, yeah, follow Scott's YouTube channel, and I'm streaming it live, but I I don't I've.

389
00:26:00,628 --> 00:26:05,571
Scott: the videos are saved on YouTube, but they're unlisted So I don't I don't know how much effort I'm gonna put.

390
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:09,527
Scott: it's like finding good bits in them and editing them but maybe I'll find some good bits.

391
00:26:09,547 --> 00:26:14,023
Scott: who knows if I'm actually streaming them on Twitch and YouTube.

392
00:26:14,043 --> 00:26:25,060
Rym: so you can go to whichever one you like and watch me from there if you Record them where your voice is a separate track or in the very least if you have a way to pick your voice out from Like Scott not talking.

393
00:26:25,982 --> 00:26:29,060
Rym: Just go to the places where you're saying shit cuz something must have happened there.

394
00:26:29,261 --> 00:26:36,560
Scott: Yeah, or someone said, you know Oh, I need people to chat at me so I can make the chat the stream more interesting rather than just me sitting there.

395
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,148
Scott: Like, you know ride my horse.

396
00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:44,552
Rym: Yep, though there is There's a whole side of YouTube and Twitch that is not.

397
00:26:44,592 --> 00:26:48,369
Rym: let's plays but long plays and the long plays Like the culture is.

398
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:53,912
Rym: you don't say shit You just play and these are the videos people go to if they want to.

399
00:26:53,952 --> 00:26:56,280
Rym: just like experience the game pure.

400
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,047
Rym: But not play it for some reason.

401
00:26:58,810 --> 00:26:59,272
Scott: just play it.

402
00:26:59,472 --> 00:27:01,380
Rym: Yeah, like there's a whole I'm getting a switch.

403
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,003
Rym: I think the price.

404
00:27:02,044 --> 00:27:03,572
Rym: I think the switch will be back and stop soon.

405
00:27:03,713 --> 00:27:08,679
Scott: stock soon because I Somebody said the Nintendo store had them in stock today at six.

406
00:27:09,081 --> 00:27:11,208
Scott: Oh, they got in a cab and went over there right away.

407
00:27:11,228 --> 00:27:16,325
Scott: And when they got there gone 603 gone 200 people were in line.

408
00:27:16,546 --> 00:27:16,968
Rym: Wow.

409
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:19,740
Rym: The thing is if you wanted a switch you should have pre-ordered it.

410
00:27:19,961 --> 00:27:22,573
Scott: I pre-ordered it on Amazon months in advance.

411
00:27:22,794 --> 00:27:24,060
Scott: All I did was go click click click.

412
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,185
Scott: I didn't have to wait in any line.

413
00:27:25,205 --> 00:27:26,270
Rym: No, I didn't order.

414
00:27:26,451 --> 00:27:30,640
Scott: and then on the day the switch was released It just showed up on my fucking doorstep.

415
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:32,305
Scott: Why didn't you do that?

416
00:27:32,907 --> 00:27:39,180
Scott: if I was gonna buy if I failed to do that for some reason I would just wait until Amazon had them in stock again and do the same.

417
00:27:39,443 --> 00:27:40,600
Scott: So not worth the effort.

418
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:51,173
Rym: So I did not pre-order because what I said on gig nights was that Nintendo would cross too many lines and Nintendo consoles went from by sight unseen to wait and see.

419
00:27:51,273 --> 00:27:55,900
Rym: so I did what I said, I waited and saw and Nintendo exceeded expectations.

420
00:27:56,583 --> 00:27:59,980
Rym: So now I'm gonna buy one as soon as I can just buy it on Amazon.

421
00:28:00,423 --> 00:28:09,400
Rym: But the price of the people trying to flip them on Amazon Suddenly today dropped by a hundred bucks I mean, but I bought mine from amazon.com and not from someone who is selling it on it.

422
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:14,143
Rym: Oh, yeah, so I'm waiting until it is MSRP Amazon.com.

423
00:28:14,183 --> 00:28:20,560
Rym: Yeah right now the people selling on Amazon are flippers and they're selling it for about 80 to 100 dollars over MSRP.

424
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:25,300
Rym: But even two days ago, it was like 200 plus dollars over MSRP.

425
00:28:25,882 --> 00:28:29,799
Rym: I feel like the people who tried to flip the switch not gonna come out ahead.

426
00:28:30,981 --> 00:28:39,496
Rym: So Scott as he was want to do because we want to queue up Wednesday episodes in advance He dropped off a bunch of comics at our house and I've read two of them so far.

427
00:28:39,516 --> 00:28:40,019
Scott: Mm-hmm.

428
00:28:40,621 --> 00:28:47,160
Rym: And I was a little worried for a second when I looked this one up for the show because it said Plutona number one.

429
00:28:47,481 --> 00:28:51,900
Rym: But I immediately realized that that's because trade paperbacks which was what we read.

430
00:28:52,273 --> 00:28:53,223
Rym: Yeah There's just one.

431
00:28:53,243 --> 00:28:57,340
Scott: there's only one volume of Plutona that contains all the issues in one book.

432
00:28:57,421 --> 00:28:59,095
Scott: So you can just buy the one book and you're good.

433
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:04,360
Scott: Yep You don't need the one book like I. don't link people to this link people to Amazon to buy the trade.

434
00:29:04,382 --> 00:29:05,610
Rym: Yeah buy the trade.

435
00:29:05,751 --> 00:29:09,328
Scott: so this is Jeff Lemire Jeff Lemire and Emmy Lennox.

436
00:29:09,389 --> 00:29:12,900
Scott: Emmy Lennox also did the arts and worked with Jeff on the story.

437
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:18,187
Scott: So Jeff Lemire obviously is like the favorite not Japanese comic creator of GeekNights.

438
00:29:18,348 --> 00:29:19,291
Rym: Yep, Jeff Lemire.

439
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:20,193
Rym: It did like.

440
00:29:20,213 --> 00:29:30,932
Scott: he doesn't always hit home run, but Like he started off with the Essex County trilogy, right when we knew Yeah Well stuff and that was like his only work then and it was so good.

441
00:29:30,952 --> 00:29:37,457
Scott: and since then like he's been doing So much stuff like they just you know, he just put his name on fucking everything.

442
00:29:37,477 --> 00:29:45,644
Scott: Yeah Superheroes at the Marvel and at the DC and at the ever, you know, but he pretty much always hits at least a double Maybe a triple.

443
00:29:45,905 --> 00:29:48,556
Rym: Yeah good half the time he rounds home, but not always.

444
00:29:48,918 --> 00:29:53,570
Scott: he did the What's it called the the the kid with the deer horns?

445
00:29:54,132 --> 00:29:55,757
Rym: Oh, yeah, I didn't actually read that.

446
00:29:55,798 --> 00:29:57,102
Scott: have all the volumes I haven't read.

447
00:29:57,182 --> 00:30:02,360
Rym: Yeah, I got a queue of comics building up over here despite you not dropping off a lot of comics lately.

448
00:30:02,643 --> 00:30:04,039
Scott: Yeah, no, I'm reading more comics now.

449
00:30:04,241 --> 00:30:11,832
Rym: Yeah, I started reading the My Little Pony again because actually that comic is still like way good I have every issue of my all my little pony trades.

450
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:12,514
Rym: I got.

451
00:30:12,594 --> 00:30:20,660
Rym: no I'm not no issues for him But Plutona is a self-contained story by the trade is just a graphic novel.

452
00:30:21,383 --> 00:30:25,240
Rym: It starts in a world that doesn't need a lot of explanation and it ends.

453
00:30:26,566 --> 00:30:27,178
Rym: Well, it ends.

454
00:30:28,221 --> 00:30:35,868
Scott: It's one of those ones that sort of like crosses the blurs the line between like the an indie comic kind of story And a superhero kind of story.

455
00:30:35,888 --> 00:30:43,376
Rym: Yeah, and it edges a little bit into the Oh Superheroes but a deconstruction but it doesn't go like the way some of those go.

456
00:30:43,496 --> 00:30:44,700
Rym: Yeah doesn't embrace that full.

457
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:51,000
Scott: It's like you're in a world with superheroes, but this you don't really get much of the story of the superheroes at all.

458
00:30:51,422 --> 00:30:53,532
Scott: It's about some high school kids.

459
00:30:53,673 --> 00:30:56,274
Scott: They're are they your middle school kids, maybe of them?

460
00:30:57,182 --> 00:31:00,373
Rym: Yeah, I couldn't tell and I didn't think too hard about it.

461
00:31:00,513 --> 00:31:01,356
Scott: It doesn't matter.

462
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:10,100
Scott: They're kids and Living in a world in which superheroes happen to exist The story is about them and not about superheroing just because superheroes happen to be there.

463
00:31:10,221 --> 00:31:10,846
Rym: Yeah, well, we'll.

464
00:31:11,088 --> 00:31:16,202
Rym: we'll avoid spoilers for the beginning But I think we'll talk a little spoiler toward the end of there's only five issues We got.

465
00:31:16,222 --> 00:31:16,605
Scott: we're gonna.

466
00:31:16,685 --> 00:31:18,660
Scott: this episode will be really short if we don't spoil it.

467
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,379
Rym: Yeah so we'll warn you when we're getting to spoilers because I actually got some things to say that require.

468
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:23,502
Rym: I Don't want to.

469
00:31:23,603 --> 00:31:25,857
Rym: I don't want to ruin this for you because you should just read it.

470
00:31:25,937 --> 00:31:27,406
Scott: It's good Yeah, and only take it.

471
00:31:27,426 --> 00:31:29,156
Scott: only take you like 15 20 minutes though.

472
00:31:29,196 --> 00:31:29,860
Rym: I did like it.

473
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,214
Rym: I haven't read a lot of other stories like it other than maybe like it.

474
00:31:34,576 --> 00:31:35,760
Rym: Yeah stand by me.

475
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:41,059
Rym: But stand by me is superficially related in that bunch of kids find a dead body.

476
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:46,000
Scott: Mm-hmm or stand by me is I definitely the first thing I thought about my me is more.

477
00:31:46,461 --> 00:31:52,080
Rym: Some kids found a dead body other kids try to go find the dead body and the movie ends with them finding the body.

478
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:53,467
Scott: Yeah, this is the beginning.

479
00:31:53,548 --> 00:31:58,399
Rym: Yeah, they find the body right away and Things are not all as they might appear.

480
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,547
Rym: So did you like did you like it?

481
00:32:01,989 --> 00:32:02,652
Scott: Yeah, it's good.

482
00:32:02,893 --> 00:32:04,019
Scott: I'm not sad that I bought it.

483
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,887
Scott: Yeah, you know, but it's not like.

484
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,899
Scott: I wouldn't give it an Eisner Award probably now.

485
00:32:09,605 --> 00:32:15,500
Rym: It was pretty good Atmospherically and the art actually worked really well in terms of setting up the characters.

486
00:32:15,841 --> 00:32:16,202
Scott: I was like.

487
00:32:16,242 --> 00:32:24,209
Scott: I was real intrigued right of like, you know when there was like unknown stuff and I want I really wanted to see what happened and it kept me hooked.

488
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:30,831
Scott: Yeah, but then you know, it sort of went, you know It wasn't it didn't really give like satisfying hits of like.

489
00:32:30,851 --> 00:32:41,783
Scott: yeah, and then you know things sort of you know Felt they started going in a direction that not only was unexpected but was also weird and Unsatisfying.

490
00:32:41,864 --> 00:32:46,497
Scott: well, so it was unsettling also, but it's like oh you're going for unsettling.

491
00:32:46,537 --> 00:32:47,239
Scott: I'm down with that.

492
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:51,933
Scott: Yeah I like that but it wasn't unsettling in the way.

493
00:32:51,993 --> 00:32:54,380
Scott: that's like, ooh, that's unsettling and it's so good.

494
00:32:54,761 --> 00:33:02,665
Rym: It was like, uh, you just kind of unsettling but at the same time it was unsettling in a very real way Because that was too real.

495
00:33:02,866 --> 00:33:09,588
Rym: this deals with actually a lot of different themes and it doesn't really say like This is the good thing.

496
00:33:09,689 --> 00:33:10,614
Rym: This is the bad thing.

497
00:33:10,714 --> 00:33:11,760
Rym: or here's our message.

498
00:33:11,841 --> 00:33:19,520
Rym: it says here's a whole bunch of issues and We're gonna explore them and make you think about them and guess what?

499
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,973
Rym: There aren't just neat easy answers to things.

500
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:25,893
Scott: I do feel like though Exploring the bunch of issues like felt good right like.

501
00:33:25,973 --> 00:33:26,697
Scott: oh look at all the stuff.

502
00:33:26,717 --> 00:33:27,320
Scott: They're getting in here.

503
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:31,319
Scott: They're covering so much material, but not much of the material.

504
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:33,227
Scott: We're like another issue.

505
00:33:33,267 --> 00:33:36,760
Scott: They could have gone deeper on each one, right and it would have been better.

506
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,836
Scott: But they think it's like they only went a little bit beyond shallow on the issues.

507
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:46,519
Scott: So it's just like Just short yep.

508
00:33:47,162 --> 00:33:58,669
Rym: So I think the main the two themes of this that I can pull drag out though and the name helps a little bit Plutona That basically superheroes are gods and in one sense.

509
00:33:58,749 --> 00:34:06,731
Rym: It's a story about if things like that exists Merely interacting with them as a human fucks you up.

510
00:34:07,052 --> 00:34:07,412
Rym: Mm-hmm.

511
00:34:07,793 --> 00:34:09,839
Rym: And I think that is a very strong theme.

512
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:23,808
Rym: That is Repeatedly due to the use of insects and where insects appear in this comic I think that theme is set very well and that the insects are unto the humans like the humans are unto The the superheroes the gods right?

513
00:34:23,848 --> 00:34:27,520
Scott: I mean, that's that's not a new theme as far as superhero books are concerned, right?

514
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:33,899
Scott: I mean we read Dark Knight Returns where basically Superman is portrayed as very godlike.

515
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:44,219
Scott: there That's yeah, that's the way Superman should be I think and he's very rarely Portrayed that way properly, you know, but it's like yeah at this fucking Superman out there basically like nothing fucking matters.

516
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,338
Scott: There's a holy shit.

517
00:34:45,822 --> 00:34:48,619
Scott: It's like yeah, you can just bow down to Superman now.

518
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,480
Rym: But then it makes this sort of swerve as you not a super spoiler.

519
00:34:52,600 --> 00:35:03,518
Rym: but you see, you know a lot of flashbacks like it's the kids with the dead body of the superhero and it's cut with flashbacks of what the superhero was doing leading up to her being dead in the woods.

520
00:35:03,538 --> 00:35:32,899
Rym: and You see her being a like 100% mundane person with mundane concerns living a mundane life except when she's doing the superhero stuff, which almost leads to this theme that There don't even need to be gods kids Generally when not when they aren't given enough explanation or context Adults are kind of like gods to them and interacting with adults without context can fuck kids up.

521
00:35:34,521 --> 00:35:46,437
Rym: That is the deepest thread I can pull out of this and it's the only way I can explain the sheer mundanity of Plutona's life as like a waitress because they really focus on that in the flashbacks.

522
00:35:46,939 --> 00:35:54,572
Scott: Mm-hmm Yeah, it's like they keep focusing on like every character is like family a lot Like, you know, it's usually in a story.

523
00:35:54,612 --> 00:36:01,460
Scott: you'll get like, you know There'd be one person like if there's a school of kids you'll get one of their families, right?

524
00:36:02,102 --> 00:36:03,347
Scott: And you'll go deep on that.

525
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:14,720
Scott: and then the other kids just be like kids and you won't see their family so much Unless you get something that's really long-running like South Park where you you know Literally look at every character, right?

526
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:21,799
Scott: But usually in most cases like you see is the family and the kids go to school and you see the other kids But you don't see the other kids.

527
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,975
Scott: Families, right because you don't spread the character tree out that far and this one you get all the kids home.

528
00:36:28,076 --> 00:36:36,180
Scott: family story deals Even though it's only five issues like the one kid has you know, the dad messing, you know is like abusive

529
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:42,803
Rym: Yeah, and the kid of course lashes out and you see the cycle of abuse being perpetrated even though he is actually trying to be A good person, right?

530
00:36:43,265 --> 00:36:50,840
Scott: Yeah, there's the turnabout with the kid with the perfectly normal family Yeah, the kid with a perfectly normal family is the most messed up one.

531
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:58,940
Scott: It's the quote-unquote normal family right the ID idyllic family Yeah, but then you know, you're looking at those families.

532
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,640
Scott: We also see Plutona's family also, right?

533
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:06,212
Scott: And it's like oh is the family of kids in school from the kids perspective.

534
00:37:06,252 --> 00:37:11,865
Scott: and here's the family of you know, superhero mom Okay, and then they bump into each other.

535
00:37:12,046 --> 00:37:26,940
Rym: but the fact that the superhero life is so mundane and kind of low-rent Really pushes pulls away the God metaphor and pulls it into the adult versus child metaphor Because otherwise I can't explain why they would focus on that.

536
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:28,406
Scott: You also have to look at like.

537
00:37:28,627 --> 00:37:31,340
Scott: these kids are basically living in this like woodsy town.

538
00:37:32,022 --> 00:37:37,100
Scott: It's like a suburb kind of place, right and the superheroes living in the city and the kids like looking.

539
00:37:37,805 --> 00:37:40,060
Scott: He's looking out at the city with telescope.

540
00:37:40,281 --> 00:37:48,571
Scott: See a lot of those scenes to watch the superheroes of this telescope from the small town Right and the superheroes only in the small town woods.

541
00:37:48,631 --> 00:37:54,871
Rym: because she got punched so hard that she simultaneously Her daughter and her family the superheroes family their city.

542
00:37:54,891 --> 00:38:04,939
Rym: They're not fucked up by interacting with gods it's Non city folk get fucked up by interacting with the complex cosmopolitan world of the city.

543
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:08,323
Rym: Yeah Sure without context because yeah actually that works.

544
00:38:08,343 --> 00:38:11,936
Rym: because the whole again that my first theme breaks down two ways.

545
00:38:11,996 --> 00:38:16,814
Rym: because the fact that Plutona's family seems to be totally normal and they know she's a superhero.

546
00:38:17,034 --> 00:38:19,523
Scott: No, she can't hide it from grandma But the kid

547
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:30,418
Rym: like is watching the news because she knows that mom's in a fight like it's just normal to them and yet it Totally ruins these kids living out in podunk suburb, whatever

548
00:38:31,283 --> 00:38:33,351
Scott: What one town away from the city podunk

549
00:38:33,372 --> 00:38:34,034
Rym: suburb, whatever.

550
00:38:34,054 --> 00:38:39,868
Rym: I think at this point we got a spoil because I Can't say anything else about this.

551
00:38:39,949 --> 00:38:42,703
Rym: So just read it and then come back to this episode I guess.

552
00:38:42,784 --> 00:38:43,852
Rym: but we're gonna spoil everything.

553
00:38:44,336 --> 00:38:44,920
Rym: after this point.

554
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:47,031
Scott: You can get it digitally too.

555
00:38:47,071 --> 00:38:48,519
Scott: if you don't want to get that pretty sure you can.

556
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:50,820
Rym: I was spoiler.

557
00:38:51,681 --> 00:38:53,649
Rym: So sure, she wasn't actually dead from the beginning.

558
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:56,500
Scott: Well, that was kind of obvious right because he's been stun ray.

559
00:38:56,864 --> 00:39:06,188
Scott: Yeah, she had been my stunner Yeah But like he had been she'd been in the woods for a while like if you're a dead body in the woods for even like a day Flies are coming at least right now,

560
00:39:06,489 --> 00:39:07,975
Rym: but to be at beginning it does

561
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:08,859
Scott: come within minutes.

562
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:13,640
Rym: Yes There's flies on her in the first panel, but it's like lies all over her.

563
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,589
Scott: She would have been way stanky if she was dead.

564
00:39:16,152 --> 00:39:17,840
Scott: Yeah, it would have not been a good scene.

565
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:25,990
Rym: But these kids just like hey, but also I forget when it's first mentioned, but they're like, I've got my man My great stunner weapon ha ha ha stuns.

566
00:39:26,171 --> 00:39:26,893
Rym: Yeah, I'll stun.

567
00:39:26,933 --> 00:39:29,140
Scott: you also like they're getting blood from her.

568
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,109
Scott: It's like man, she dead the blood ain't flowing.

569
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:45,393
Rym: Well, they it's basically Tugger, you know when there's a kid in a comic or a story like this who is made fun of for something weird Usually the the twist is like that kid's actually okay, or that was just like youthful whatever.

570
00:39:45,834 --> 00:39:53,711
Rym: no that kid was kind of messed up and Masturbating two people in school and yet.

571
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:56,560
Rym: Yeah, he was totally fucked up and that continued.

572
00:39:57,162 --> 00:40:00,154
Rym: Like that kid had problems and was not redeemed.

573
00:40:00,455 --> 00:40:01,660
Rym: He just went crazy.

574
00:40:02,282 --> 00:40:04,311
Rym: Kid was probably would have become a serial killer.

575
00:40:04,331 --> 00:40:14,869
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I mean sometimes you know There's a nerdy kid who's made fun of be not because you know bullies are bullies, but because Someone's actually doing something weird.

576
00:40:14,889 --> 00:40:17,280
Scott: That's not socially acceptable and is being socially shunned.

577
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,868
Scott: Yeah, and it's it's showing you that which usually is.

578
00:40:20,949 --> 00:40:27,349
Scott: it's interesting cuz usually in a superhero comic you get the Peter Parker nerd story Which is like no stop picking on that nerd.

579
00:40:27,389 --> 00:40:29,035
Scott: The nerds gonna become spider-man watch out.

580
00:40:29,316 --> 00:40:30,260
Scott: Yeah, we're here.

581
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:36,060
Scott: It's like kids actually bad and everyone can tell and that's why he's getting picked on.

582
00:40:37,222 --> 00:40:42,880
Scott: At first you think like the bully kid is bad, and they give you that stereotypical story of bully kid is being abused.

583
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,929
Scott: That's why he's bullying, but it's like no.

584
00:40:46,009 --> 00:40:47,794
Scott: He's really only bullying that one kid.

585
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,620
Scott: Yeah, who's actually bad?

586
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,220
Rym: Well, he bullies the girl in green a few times, but then I forget all their names, right?

587
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:59,420
Scott: But when he's bullying her it it felt to me at least like kids who don't know better like the girl they like.

588
00:40:59,687 --> 00:41:05,802
Scott: No It felt to me at least more like how friends would just sort of talk smack Right.

589
00:41:05,822 --> 00:41:10,279
Scott: when he was when you know to the kid who was actually bad it actually felt like he was bullying him.

590
00:41:10,399 --> 00:41:12,490
Scott: true At least that's just the way I read it.

591
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:13,838
Scott: You know I could be totally right.

592
00:41:13,878 --> 00:41:16,180
Rym: even then He still also tries to make friends with a kid.

593
00:41:16,321 --> 00:41:19,641
Rym: I mean that he'd like is hanging out with him and like wants to yeah They

594
00:41:19,661 --> 00:41:29,572
Scott: give you that scene right where it's like oh they find something in common Right and they start you know until someone else is there to see and he's like oh no I can't be seen being friends with you in front of anybody.

595
00:41:29,813 --> 00:41:33,313
Scott: yep, but if no one's around okay Let's chat about video games or whatever.

596
00:41:33,656 --> 00:41:35,325
Rym: so I Subjects wise.

597
00:41:35,446 --> 00:41:46,859
Rym: I read that the blonde girl in green again I don't remember any other names already, and I just read this pretty sure she has Romantic feelings toward the other girl and the other girl is romantic feelings toward the bully guy.

598
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:54,520
Rym: yeah And tugger just wants to be a god yeah, and the younger brother is just kidding like he's actually just a nerdy kid.

599
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,252
Rym: Yeah, but they just get dragged into shit like he's mostly focused on his gameboy.

600
00:41:58,472 --> 00:41:58,693
Scott: Yep.

601
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:00,378
Scott: He just does good drink.

602
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:06,010
Rym: yep uh Pretty much as soon as that kid was cutting himself.

603
00:42:06,813 --> 00:42:08,660
Rym: I was pretty sure he was just gonna die.

604
00:42:10,422 --> 00:42:12,068
Scott: Like is he gonna get AIDS or something?

605
00:42:12,128 --> 00:42:12,489
Scott: I was like.

606
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:15,540
Scott: I was like okay, obviously he's not getting superpowers.

607
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:17,151
Scott: That's not where this is going right.

608
00:42:17,212 --> 00:42:23,480
Rym: so for a second I was wondering like maybe it'll work cuz that would make this a way different story.

609
00:42:23,701 --> 00:42:27,458
Scott: I thought that there were gonna be some other consequences that weren't right.

610
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:28,783
Scott: cuz like okay You're doing something.

611
00:42:28,843 --> 00:42:29,486
Scott: so that's that.

612
00:42:29,666 --> 00:42:31,593
Scott: doing that is a Chekhov's gun of some kind.

613
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:34,658
Scott: right something is gonna happen because you're doing that But it's not gonna be.

614
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:44,787
Rym: To find it There's a scene in one of the last later flashbacks where Plutona herself is like I could snap wafts neck without effort But I can't.

615
00:42:45,149 --> 00:42:46,679
Rym: I need to be better hit to than him.

616
00:42:47,082 --> 00:42:52,371
Rym: I need to keep the Plutona power under control And there's a few references to the powers.

617
00:42:52,732 --> 00:43:00,329
Rym: let her lose control some superhero nonsense Yep, so I thought I wondered if that was maybe That like foreshadowing something.

618
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,939
Scott: yeah, like maybe she would just explode or something out in the woods.

619
00:43:03,221 --> 00:43:05,520
Scott: Yeah, he's messing with her and the power gets up.

620
00:43:05,761 --> 00:43:09,417
Rym: We don't know where the power comes from but now now he's dead and they clearly didn't go to the police.

621
00:43:09,478 --> 00:43:10,570
Rym: and these kids are All fucked.

622
00:43:10,896 --> 00:43:13,086
Scott: yeah like they saw some fucked up shit.

623
00:43:13,267 --> 00:43:14,150
Rym: and this ends with.

624
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:22,488
Rym: like the next day the cops show up because the kids dead and they All get implicated because of modern you know cell phones and stuff And they all have to testify in their minors.

625
00:43:22,548 --> 00:43:29,389
Rym: and like it ends on a like you're all gonna learn a hard lesson about life kids Mm-hmm, and it just like that's it.

626
00:43:29,449 --> 00:43:30,513
Rym: It's very unsatisfied.

627
00:43:30,573 --> 00:43:32,620
Scott: I think the best part that was in Plutona wakes up.

628
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,726
Scott: She's just like what the fuck right?

629
00:43:33,767 --> 00:43:40,556
Scott: you expect like the superhero to wake up And you're totally expecting her to just like see these kids and like be like you know.

630
00:43:40,596 --> 00:43:50,274
Scott: they would tell her what happened And she would lecture them right cuz that's what Superman would do right yeah, or Batman would do is they'd be like You know I realize they're in trouble, and it helped them right.

631
00:43:50,314 --> 00:43:51,760
Scott: It's like you see some kids in trouble.

632
00:43:51,881 --> 00:43:56,447
Scott: It's like you save them, and then you wag your finger at them And then you tell them how the world is.

633
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,600
Scott: you know set him on the straight path cuz that's how you do.

634
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:02,967
Scott: But now this she just wakes up And she's just like what the fuck I get.

635
00:44:03,127 --> 00:44:05,559
Scott: any adult that wakes up in the woods after a hangover.

636
00:44:05,841 --> 00:44:06,728
Scott: It was like what the fuck.

637
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:07,112
Scott: Oh shit.

638
00:44:07,152 --> 00:44:07,676
Scott: I gotta get home.

639
00:44:07,757 --> 00:44:09,044
Scott: Oh my god How long have I been here?

640
00:44:09,245 --> 00:44:10,891
Rym: and then she's pissed like what happened.

641
00:44:10,931 --> 00:44:13,120
Rym: my fingers cuz tugger was cutting her right?

642
00:44:13,642 --> 00:44:14,505
Scott: She just goes home.

643
00:44:14,545 --> 00:44:16,792
Scott: She doesn't know these kids are there or know anything that happened.

644
00:44:16,933 --> 00:44:21,909
Rym: meanwhile at the same time an adult It would often do that like what are you kids doing?

645
00:44:21,949 --> 00:44:22,953
Rym: what the fuck I got?

646
00:44:23,173 --> 00:44:25,080
Rym: I got my own real-life adult stuff to do.

647
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,024
Scott: I'm not my kid.

648
00:44:26,064 --> 00:44:27,530
Scott: Yeah, if you're not your kids.

649
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:29,700
Scott: You're just like you're not hanging out with any strange kids.

650
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:38,446
Rym: Yeah The same time like they legit needed help and that kid might have survived if she had in any way Tried to help them.

651
00:44:38,466 --> 00:44:43,140
Scott: right well could mean the superhero is her job the way She helps us by fighting villain.

652
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:45,231
Scott: I guess the villain guy wants like who knows what he wants.

653
00:44:45,271 --> 00:44:47,000
Scott: blow up the city rob all the banks right?

654
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:48,303
Scott: That's what she's stopping.

655
00:44:48,343 --> 00:44:49,728
Scott: She's not capable of handling.

656
00:44:49,748 --> 00:44:54,631
Scott: You know these everyday or kids social issues That's not what a superhero can do.

657
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:58,640
Scott: she punches hard And she can't even solve her own social issues with her own family.

658
00:44:58,781 --> 00:45:01,180
Scott: But at the same time she's gonna solve some kids fucked up head.

659
00:45:01,522 --> 00:45:06,526
Rym: She could have just picked him up and taken him to the hospital sure But I don't think she even noticed him.

660
00:45:06,848 --> 00:45:10,520
Scott: no cuz she was just pissed and she just woke up from being KO for days.

661
00:45:10,821 --> 00:45:12,911
Scott: Yep, how's she gonna notice some kid lying there?

662
00:45:12,931 --> 00:45:14,600
Scott: She's like oh shit gotta fly home.

663
00:45:15,162 --> 00:45:16,508
Rym: So yeah it dealt with it.

664
00:45:16,709 --> 00:45:25,510
Rym: we it wove a lot of interesting themes together Didn't fully deliver on any of them or in the very least did not give Concrete stances on any of them.

665
00:45:25,651 --> 00:45:36,090
Rym: hmm it just introduced them Showed you a kind of grim and realistic ending and also kind of left you with this feeling that no there aren't endings There's always the next day, and you have to deal with shit.

666
00:45:36,452 --> 00:45:37,357
Scott: at least it's you know.

667
00:45:37,437 --> 00:45:42,890
Scott: it's unique It's short it's inexpensive You know it's well-written.

668
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:44,800
Scott: the art is way good, right?

669
00:45:45,961 --> 00:45:46,884
Scott: So it's worth your.

670
00:45:47,024 --> 00:45:48,328
Scott: you know the amount of time.

671
00:45:48,369 --> 00:45:49,693
Scott: It will take you to experience.

672
00:45:49,753 --> 00:45:51,378
Scott: It is just not something.

673
00:45:51,398 --> 00:45:55,476
Scott: That's Legendary must be on every bookshelf next to Watchmen.

674
00:45:55,757 --> 00:45:59,482
Rym: yep, it's something I would read on my commute alongside all the other stuff I read.

675
00:46:00,104 --> 00:46:04,079
Scott: you won't be sad that you read it, and you know put in the time to go for it.

676
00:46:04,641 --> 00:46:08,675
Scott: But if you're not gonna like remember it and recommend it for the ages.
