1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,899
Rym: Hey, it's Monday, June 29th.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:12,622
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,862 --> 00:00:17,493
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight HTML5.

4
00:00:25,883 --> 00:00:26,917
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,944 --> 00:00:31,707
Rym: Well last week.

6
00:00:31,788 --> 00:00:34,098
Rym: I went to SIFMA in the city my work.

7
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:38,620
Rym: actually I got a free pass and they let me take like four hours off to go poke around.

8
00:00:38,721 --> 00:00:39,907
Rym: What's SIFMA?

9
00:00:39,927 --> 00:00:55,500
Rym: SIFMA is the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, which is I Designed specifically for High-end ultra enterprise technology as it applies to the financial markets of the world.

10
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,667
Scott: That's a really specific trade show.

11
00:00:57,687 --> 00:00:58,590
Scott: You know crowded.

12
00:00:58,831 --> 00:01:00,556
Rym: It was crazy crowded was.

13
00:01:00,636 --> 00:01:01,720
Rym: it was actually gigantic.

14
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:04,271
Rym: It was bigger than a lot of the smaller anime cons we go to.

15
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:06,360
Rym: huh it was in the Hilton.

16
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,945
Scott: I think I wasn't in the Javits.

17
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:12,200
Rym: nah, okay, but they used like almost all the function space.

18
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,660
Rym: They had all these different areas, but I know I didn't go to SIFMA last year.

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,560
Rym: I just I didn't think too, but this year You know I took my free pass and I went and I walked around.

20
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:24,060
Rym: I didn't go into any of the events or any of the like behind closed doors things.

21
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:30,340
Rym: But I met the people who work for the group that makes the fixed protocol like the actual people that make the fixed.

22
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,163
Scott: Oh, there's a people.

23
00:01:31,344 --> 00:01:31,705
Scott: It's not.

24
00:01:31,745 --> 00:01:33,913
Scott: it's not like a you know an industry standard.

25
00:01:33,953 --> 00:01:35,739
Scott: It's like it's a one company makes it.

26
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,830
Rym: well No, it is an industry standard, and there's an open consortium.

27
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:41,239
Rym: that yeah right the consortium, so that was there.

28
00:01:41,962 --> 00:01:45,497
Scott: So I talked to consortium is usually a bunch of companies not just one.

29
00:01:45,517 --> 00:01:57,557
Rym: well Yeah But the body that is created by them the body that actually maintains your like the infrastructure like the website where they host the current Standard and the comments on the new standard and all that stuff mm-hmm.

30
00:01:58,161 --> 00:02:02,000
Rym: So I talked to them and they were pretty cool, and I learned you know I'm the NTP guy.

31
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:09,788
Rym: I I've realized over time that I'm one of the few NTP guys and server fault has told me as I went and answered Every question about NTP.

32
00:02:09,809 --> 00:02:11,476
Rym: no because people just don't know how to use it.

33
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,304
Rym: yeah, but That's what I use.

34
00:02:14,324 --> 00:02:14,926
Rym: That's what I know.

35
00:02:15,248 --> 00:02:16,794
Rym: and as I was walking around.

36
00:02:16,834 --> 00:02:21,838
Rym: You know my boss was walking around He comes to me the next day after six months as hey, so can you get us some of that PTP?

37
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,684
Rym: And I'm like what's PTP?

38
00:02:23,704 --> 00:02:31,419
Rym: and he says the precision time protocol it should get us nanosecond to accuracy as opposed to the NTP microsecond accuracy.

39
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,624
Scott: is It BS?

40
00:02:33,885 --> 00:02:35,330
Rym: no, it's not however.

41
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:39,382
Rym: I don't know if it is Useful?

42
00:02:39,682 --> 00:02:40,886
Scott: is it non free?

43
00:02:41,348 --> 00:02:41,589
Rym: well.

44
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,779
Rym: It's not free in the sense that it requires hardware.

45
00:02:45,341 --> 00:02:50,544
Rym: It is here's as far as I can tell all I've read To qualify this.

46
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:54,440
Rym: I have read a white paper, and I have looked at a diagram.

47
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,179
Rym: I haven't gone into any more depth than that.

48
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:17,220
Rym: The PTP as far as I can tell is a mechanism of using a physical device to put insert hardware time stamps into packets such that you can determine the latency between devices to the nanosecond level and Using that you can then have perfectly synchronized time with real-time kernels between all your devices.

49
00:03:18,662 --> 00:03:21,454
Scott: Okay, but do you really need that much precision?

50
00:03:21,575 --> 00:03:24,301
Rym: we do more than Microsecond.

51
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:30,320
Rym: you realize I have developers coming to me already in our you know testing environment, and they're like look at these logs.

52
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,647
Rym: I'm like okay, and they're like this is bullshit.

53
00:03:32,887 --> 00:03:33,168
Rym: How come?

54
00:03:33,188 --> 00:03:39,519
Rym: the time is off by like six microseconds, and I'm like Jesus Christ, man How can you even tell?

55
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:41,923
Rym: Like the clock?

56
00:03:41,943 --> 00:03:44,091
Scott: you're not just bullshitting you know I'm sure.

57
00:03:44,112 --> 00:03:44,754
Rym: I'm sure.

58
00:03:44,814 --> 00:03:46,159
Scott: what did they do before you were there?

59
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,088
Scott: The time must have been way off.

60
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:55,659
Rym: well now because they weren't doing this kind of thing My company is advancing rapidly in what we do and this was stuff that wasn't even done when I wasn't there.

61
00:03:56,921 --> 00:04:08,687
Rym: But NTP is basically the protocol for synchronizing things in a way that is nice for computers But nice for computers does not mean nice for Accurate timekeeping.

62
00:04:09,511 --> 00:04:15,651
Scott: if you need that much accurate timekeeping Just get your own atomic clock and connect all your computers to it directly.

63
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:18,880
Rym: that actually would be a terrible idea for a number of reasons.

64
00:04:20,212 --> 00:04:21,401
Rym: One it's not so much I mean.

65
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:29,933
Rym: one idea is that you want to have the time be synchronous between all of your devices - I want my time to synchronize to an external body.

66
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:39,235
Rym: if I'm following my atomic clock But someone else is using their atomic clock while the intervals are the same I have to make sure that I match exactly at the start and then nothing gets off.

67
00:04:39,556 --> 00:04:41,503
Scott: get to atomic clocks.

68
00:04:41,904 --> 00:04:49,706
Rym: a better way is to synchronize to the same atomic clock that all the people I do business with are syncing to and Synchronize your atomic clock with that atomic clock.

69
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:54,700
Rym: Well, you see why don't I just use PA PTP to synchronize my devices to my?

70
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:57,911
Scott: Because it seems like an unnecessary ludicrous thing.

71
00:04:58,212 --> 00:04:59,075
Rym: No, it looks pretty.

72
00:04:59,356 --> 00:05:00,520
Rym: the math behind it's pretty cool.

73
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:01,045
Rym: I'm gonna.

74
00:05:01,187 --> 00:05:01,470
Rym: I will.

75
00:05:01,793 --> 00:05:05,400
Rym: in a couple weeks I'll know the fullness of this and I will be able to talk about it in depth.

76
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:14,607
Scott: but also I think that the number of people on the earth who never need for a greater than NTP accuracy is maybe like to Know.

77
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,340
Rym: you'd be surprised All right, but what about science?

78
00:05:19,522 --> 00:05:21,779
Scott: But anyway, the sciences have their own atomic clocks.

79
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:26,020
Rym: I just say is pretty cool that the one that's why all the atomic clocks are at science lab.

80
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,798
Rym: But one thing that worries me is that it appears to need an entire separate physical infrastructure.

81
00:05:32,341 --> 00:05:36,360
Rym: As in you have a backplane Ethernet or something that everything uses just to synchronize time.

82
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:40,515
Scott: So you need to double your network size, which is fine.

83
00:05:40,576 --> 00:05:48,933
Rym: All right, like an IBM We did that to have a full backplane moderating system, which basically came down to me Connecting an entire new LAN to every server.

84
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:54,015
Scott: every computer needs like an extra Nick and you need to double the switches and double the routers.

85
00:05:54,076 --> 00:05:57,449
Rym: and well We would probably wouldn't have routers for this.

86
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,557
Rym: It would probably only be on a local subnet.

87
00:05:59,718 --> 00:06:05,977
Rym: No Steven So yeah, but I mean we already have like two four or five gigi interfaces on every single server.

88
00:06:06,037 --> 00:06:09,047
Scott: So Those the real interfaces.

89
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:12,418
Scott: actually real interface is enough room for more interfaces.

90
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,671
Scott: Yes How many network cards he got in there?

91
00:06:15,952 --> 00:06:18,040
Rym: I actually we just ordered these ninja boxes.

92
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:29,635
Rym: They're basically they have these special hardware nicks that have all this packet inspection stuff built into them Such that I can fully sniff and analyze gigi in real time.

93
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:30,537
Rym: Mm-hmm.

94
00:06:30,678 --> 00:06:31,360
Rym: It's crazy.

95
00:06:31,763 --> 00:06:33,480
Scott: All right, it is absolutely crazy.

96
00:06:33,962 --> 00:06:36,957
Rym: And then all we discovered was well now we need to make our application.

97
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:37,279
Rym: do that.

98
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:42,095
Rym: That was what I spent my a couple of days doing but step move was cool.

99
00:06:42,115 --> 00:06:45,548
Rym: the one thing that's interesting I've been to a lot of trade shows and they always suck.

100
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,900
Rym: They're just really boring and it's like trade shows don't suck.

101
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,828
Rym: Well a lot of technology

102
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:51,430
Scott: on the trade

103
00:06:51,591 --> 00:07:02,634
Rym: industry centric trade shows Tend to be a lot of people trying to sell me things that are not entirely true or trying to sell me products I don't actually need and mostly trying to sell me things but not giving you have to go

104
00:07:02,654 --> 00:07:04,000
Scott: to food industry trade shows.

105
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,891
Rym: Well because they give me food and it's great.

106
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:21,186
Rym: So SIFMA Basically as far I'll describe it to you like this There was infinite booze of any strife and free food and coffee and hangout places and couches and I've entered to win like all These BMW motorcycles.

107
00:07:21,286 --> 00:07:23,213
Scott: and it was you know, I noticed.

108
00:07:23,453 --> 00:07:25,420
Rym: well the drawings aren't for another couple weeks.

109
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:28,149
Rym: Yeah, I entered a lot of contests at this.

110
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:32,849
Rym: thing is a drop in your business card contest Yep, but some of them were fill out this survey.

111
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:41,359
Rym: So yeah, I basically carried around Work business cards for companies that looked legitimate and GeekNights business cards for companies that look like they were making shit up.

112
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:46,520
Rym: Yeah, because I didn't want the companies that were making shit up to ever contact me in a professional capacity.

113
00:07:47,761 --> 00:07:49,653
Rym: But if they email me with GeekNights, that's great.

114
00:07:49,673 --> 00:07:50,377
Rym: I'll get them on the show.

115
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:51,682
Scott: God.

116
00:07:51,884 --> 00:08:02,064
Rym: but like the London Stock Exchange had a booth and I Hung out there and they were just giving out champagne and sit in this little lounge and just chatting and everyone was all just hanging out I should get that job.

117
00:08:02,746 --> 00:08:04,653
Rym: And yeah, it was real fun.

118
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:05,978
Rym: I I wouldn't.

119
00:08:06,138 --> 00:08:13,308
Rym: some year I should just take the day off work and just just go to this convention and just drink and eat all day and then go Home, not a bad idea.

120
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:13,971
Scott: It's free.

121
00:08:14,192 --> 00:08:15,639
Scott: That's the reason they have those things.

122
00:08:15,981 --> 00:08:19,140
Scott: Yeah, basically everyone's like I'll give you as much money as you want.

123
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,891
Scott: Let me get the day off work and just truck and hang out.

124
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:23,015
Scott: Oh, thank you.

125
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:23,337
Scott: Thank you.

126
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,220
Scott: Here's even more money.

127
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:25,697
Scott: Oh, thank you for getting me out of work.

128
00:08:27,064 --> 00:08:29,081
Scott: You saved me Thank you.

129
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:29,743
Scott: Okay.

130
00:08:30,264 --> 00:08:30,766
Rym: It was alright.

131
00:08:31,046 --> 00:08:32,530
Scott: So check this news out right?

132
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,332
Rym: I can't I'm checking.

133
00:08:33,653 --> 00:08:38,005
Scott: So remember when Pirate Bay did Bay image Whatever came of that?

134
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:38,549
Rym: I never went.

135
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:40,458
Scott: basically no one uses it as far as I can tell.

136
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,953
Scott: I mean like I've never seen anyone linked to it there.

137
00:08:42,974 --> 00:08:44,020
Rym: right now while you keep talking.

138
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,852
Rym: Alright, cuz I remember I predicted that there's no use for it.

139
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:47,474
Scott: Yeah.

140
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:50,323
Scott: Well, I mean basically You know, it's like.

141
00:08:50,384 --> 00:08:54,940
Scott: what kind of image are you gonna post that other people are gonna take down other than child?

142
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,706
Scott: And they weren't allowing child porn.

143
00:08:56,726 --> 00:08:58,875
Scott: They were pretty much saying anything but child porn.

144
00:08:58,936 --> 00:08:59,920
Rym: I'm looking at Pokemon art.

145
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,764
Rym: I'm gonna look around.

146
00:09:00,845 --> 00:09:03,800
Scott: I mean, it's like you can just host images on your own website.

147
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,144
Rym: Really, you know what?

148
00:09:05,184 --> 00:09:06,630
Rym: The biggest tag is right here.

149
00:09:07,252 --> 00:09:08,277
Scott: What Ranma?

150
00:09:08,678 --> 00:09:14,715
Scott: All right Alright, so is everyone storing all the 4chan images, you know, I mean, there's always places to put images.

151
00:09:14,735 --> 00:09:16,440
Scott: We don't really need Bay image.

152
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:25,404
Scott: But they're making video Bay and the extreme beta is out now I Wouldn't recommend using this extreme.

153
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:26,146
Rym: Oh my god.

154
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:31,260
Rym: It's all Pokemon porn, of course, Ranma porn, of course.

155
00:09:32,262 --> 00:09:36,580
Scott: So video Bay, I wouldn't recommend using the extreme beta.

156
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:39,369
Rym: It's a it's a vaporion and a Pidgeot.

157
00:09:39,569 --> 00:09:42,017
Scott: having said why are you looking at it still?

158
00:09:42,057 --> 00:09:42,940
Rym: It's like a train wreck.

159
00:09:43,303 --> 00:09:43,988
Rym: Oh, there's a penis.

160
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:44,532
Rym: Okay, I'm done.

161
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:45,479
Rym: Oh my god.

162
00:09:46,781 --> 00:09:49,753
Scott: So the Bay the video Bay the extreme beta.

163
00:09:49,914 --> 00:09:51,280
Scott: you should not use it for two reasons.

164
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,140
Scott: Number one is extreme beta probably doesn't work - it's gonna be just like Bay image.

165
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,974
Rym: It's gonna be Ranma and Pokemon porn and nothing else.

166
00:09:57,994 --> 00:10:00,971
Scott: That's possibly true But - they're apparently there.

167
00:10:01,172 --> 00:10:02,500
Scott: since it's so beta right now.

168
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,749
Scott: They're like storing all your passwords and plain text and you can tell they're doing this because they email you the password you said After you register.

169
00:10:09,113 --> 00:10:22,220
Scott: awesome yeah, so I wouldn't use it right now, but it is interesting because While Bay image right isn't really necessary because there's no people really taking images off of hosted places.

170
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:27,940
Scott: Video Bay, I mean YouTube takes down a lot of copyrighted stuff.

171
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:32,600
Scott: I mean how many of our things of the day always get taken down and then we can't find them.

172
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,213
Rym: I mean so someone uploaded what appears to be all of xkcd to Bay image.

173
00:10:37,655 --> 00:10:39,300
Scott: Why are you still looking at Bay him?

174
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,874
Rym: I'm fascinated by it.

175
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:52,160
Scott: anyway Video Bay could be pretty awesome if there's all of Dilbert Mm-hmm, if people post like all the copyrighted videos they get taken off of YouTube to video Bay.

176
00:10:52,722 --> 00:11:00,690
Scott: maybe video Bay could become like the default go-to place, but I Wonder they're currently an extreme beta.

177
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,880
Scott: I mean by the time they're not an extreme beta.

178
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:09,040
Scott: Are they gonna be like, you know is video in the website still gonna be something people want?

179
00:11:09,281 --> 00:11:17,820
Rym: You know, a lot of people were saying that Bay image or I guess they'll say the same thing about this are going to be Used for good purposes like right now the situation in Iran.

180
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:23,696
Rym: It'd be great If there was a place where people could put all this stuff to where no one would take it down or mess with it And the world can see it.

181
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:32,700
Rym: There are a grand total of three Images with the Iran tag on Bay and right now they am just not being used for anything worthwhile.

182
00:11:33,763 --> 00:11:35,157
Scott: Not that you can tell right away.

183
00:11:35,218 --> 00:11:38,189
Rym: anyway It's nothing but Pokemon porn.

184
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,600
Scott: it's major mostly Pokemon fun.

185
00:11:41,043 --> 00:11:43,739
Rym: I would say the vast majority of it is Pokemon porn.

186
00:11:44,734 --> 00:11:50,800
Scott: Wow Well Bay video Bay might just turn into Pokemon porn video city.

187
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:54,539
Scott: So if you like Pokemon porn, this is good news for you.

188
00:11:56,701 --> 00:12:11,097
Scott: Yeah, I think it's just interesting that despite guilty verdicts and everyone Pirate Bay is gonna keep fighting like You know, there's no tomorrow like Napster caved Supernova that all they remember the original bit torrent video site.

189
00:12:11,157 --> 00:12:13,846
Scott: they caved caved but.

190
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:19,990
Scott: but Pirate Bay is going to fight forever and Till they can't fight anymore and they're even.

191
00:12:20,191 --> 00:12:34,525
Scott: in fact, they're not only gonna keep themselves up but they're gonna keep doing new stuff to stick it to the man and that's that's good by me even if the things they actually Make you know are just useless Pokemon porn hosting situations It doesn't matter.

192
00:12:34,645 --> 00:12:37,878
Scott: as long as you know, they're still sticking it to the man, you know.

193
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:41,928
Rym: So in other news, we all know Michael Jackson.

194
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:42,871
Rym: We talked about that.

195
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:43,774
Scott: He's got we didn't?

196
00:12:44,255 --> 00:12:45,820
Rym: we talked about that on the previous show?

197
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,422
Scott: No, we didn't.

198
00:12:46,442 --> 00:12:51,860
Scott: the previous show was a Thursday and he died on Friday, but we did a show on celebrity death Scott.

199
00:12:52,402 --> 00:12:52,903
Scott: Oh, right.

200
00:12:52,963 --> 00:12:54,488
Scott: Yes, right.

201
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:58,120
Rym: Would we have done that show prior to this guy about that show?

202
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,960
Rym: I mean it would have been crazy if we had done that show randomly, you know before all this happened.

203
00:13:03,647 --> 00:13:10,797
Rym: Okay But there were two interesting stories on slashdot kind of follow-ups to this.

204
00:13:10,997 --> 00:13:17,000
Rym: one was that The put the primary cause of all the website slowing down as a result of this.

205
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,439
Rym: We're not the websites of the hosting themselves, but the ad networks that couldn't keep up.

206
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:22,846
Scott: Yeah, I mean it is a problem.

207
00:13:22,866 --> 00:13:24,433
Scott: you visit a website right like.

208
00:13:24,714 --> 00:13:26,080
Scott: take it take our website, right?

209
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,878
Scott: I got the like the Google Analytics on there.

210
00:13:28,301 --> 00:13:31,894
Scott: It's like okay the website loads need to wait for Google Analytics to load.

211
00:13:32,335 --> 00:13:36,980
Scott: or you visit like, you know A website that has like ads from project wonderful.

212
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,880
Scott: It's like okay you load the website and now you have to wait for the ad from project wonderful to load.

213
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,820
Scott: It's not all coming from the same server.

214
00:13:43,981 --> 00:13:54,940
Rym: The thing is one the ad networks clearly can't keep up with any sort of load and they have no real Incentive to especially if I know this isn't the case everywhere, but there are places where the website won't load until the ads load.

215
00:13:55,421 --> 00:14:00,696
Scott: It depends on a lot of different factors a browser and hosting and all sort of stuff.

216
00:14:01,037 --> 00:14:04,348
Rym: while this is interesting It's not really a concern of mine because one ad block.

217
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:14,478
Rym: Yep, and two even if they somehow Someday prevent me from using ad block I'll just use the ad block that pretends to download the ad and doesn't show it to me.

218
00:14:14,739 --> 00:14:16,052
Rym: Yep They can't detect that ever.

219
00:14:16,335 --> 00:14:27,717
Rym: Nope Yeah, but the more interesting one the much more interesting one was that Supposedly and there are a bunch of stories about this I did not do any due diligence or dig up any like further sources, but it was on slashdot.

220
00:14:27,737 --> 00:14:28,520
Rym: I figured that's good enough.

221
00:14:29,082 --> 00:14:47,639
Rym: They were talking about how Google at least initially in the early hours after Michael Jackson's death was hit by so many searches such a massive spike in Google usage that they thought it was a DDoS attack of some kind and at least in some places put up the 404 while they sort of things

222
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:47,860
Scott: out.

223
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:54,034
Scott: I mean that is interesting in that you know you think about it and this is part of the reason why I like spam.

224
00:14:54,054 --> 00:15:00,118
Scott: filtering and such is so difficult because it is you know, and why we have captchas and all these sorts of things.

225
00:15:00,138 --> 00:15:18,151
Scott: a Attack is often completely indistinguishable from legitimate usage and it's it's you know Next to impossible to you know, determine the difference between the two even if you have like humans Investigating with their own eyeballs, so it's.

226
00:15:18,232 --> 00:15:33,064
Rym: it's gonna be a problem basically forever Yeah, but what I find interesting is that this this really belies the the technical proficiency of the greater Populace more so than people might have already suspected because I remember way back in the day I don't know.

227
00:15:33,104 --> 00:15:34,573
Scott: We already suspect a lot.

228
00:15:34,593 --> 00:15:40,425
Rym: I Still say that it belies it because people Still don't get it.

229
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:41,751
Rym: Michael Jackson's done.

230
00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:42,333
Rym: That's the news.

231
00:15:42,353 --> 00:15:45,163
Rym: Let's say we know it's happened or people hear Yeah, Michael Jackson died.

232
00:15:45,784 --> 00:15:54,329
Rym: smart people go to a news aggregator of some kind or just go to one of their trusted news sites CNN.com news.google.com.

233
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:57,240
Rym: Yeah, one of those places and confirm it, you know, it'll be on the front page.

234
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:57,963
Rym: It was legitimate.

235
00:15:58,143 --> 00:15:59,689
Rym: dig calm or maybe they.

236
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:03,508
Rym: maybe they go to Google News and they search for it there I do Google News.

237
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:09,820
Rym: Yep, or of course I mean remember in the previous times like September 11th princess die all these things in the past.

238
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,314
Rym: You go to a place like FARC and slashed out.

239
00:16:12,334 --> 00:16:13,420
Rym: those places never go down.

240
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,639
Rym: They can handle pretty much any traffic anyone throws at him.

241
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:20,096
Rym: Yeah, and they will always be there to give you the news when everyone else has failed.

242
00:16:20,337 --> 00:16:27,560
Rym: Mm-hmm But the majority of people go to Google apparently and just type Michael Jackson into Google.

243
00:16:29,241 --> 00:16:33,417
Rym: Now my question to you people obviously the tech people here don't they know the answer to this.

244
00:16:33,457 --> 00:16:36,311
Rym: but to these people What do you expect to find?

245
00:16:36,553 --> 00:16:37,359
Rym: What are you looking for?

246
00:16:37,641 --> 00:16:46,600
Rym: You're gonna find like I don't know Michael Jackson's website Which is gonna say died and you're gonna find the Wikipedia article about Michael Jackson Unless you're searching for something specific.

247
00:16:47,542 --> 00:17:09,329
Rym: every time I see people can't and they can't find something on the internet or I See people like the sure sign that someone doesn't get how the internet works is when they search for generic information in a search engine mmm, like someone who searches for something like puppies or Raising puppies as opposed to searching for a specific piece of information You're basically just asking for problems.

248
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,915
Scott: Yeah, I mean you're not.

249
00:17:11,215 --> 00:17:11,998
Scott: it that's like, you know.

250
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:16,108
Scott: I mean you go to the card catalog in the library cars.

251
00:17:16,147 --> 00:17:16,910
Scott: I'm looking for cars.

252
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,810
Scott: What about them how they work?

253
00:17:21,781 --> 00:17:26,079
Scott: You know how to buy one, you know, if you're searching you need a specific thing.

254
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:30,692
Scott: I mean at least search for like, you know, how did Michael Jackson die?

255
00:17:31,153 --> 00:17:33,620
Scott: or you know, when did Michael Jackson?

256
00:17:34,925 --> 00:17:36,611
Scott: Did Michael Jackson?

257
00:17:36,732 --> 00:17:38,980
Rym: if you're savvy don't search for that.

258
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:47,247
Rym: Just go to one of the news aggregators or one of the places like Parker slash shot and in that story or possibly in the comments The answers are all gonna be there.

259
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:49,118
Rym: Yeah, there's nothing you're gonna find.

260
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:49,420
Rym: searching.

261
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:56,260
Scott: I mean if you're just searching let's say, you know, he died But now you're searching for like, you know, Michael Jackson stuff to feel all nostalgic.

262
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,427
Scott: Well, you can't don't just search for Michael Jackson.

263
00:17:58,447 --> 00:18:02,300
Scott: You get a search for like Michael Jackson music videos, you know.

264
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,020
Scott: Or you know a specific song and you want to see the lyrics.

265
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:09,659
Rym: Yeah, like when you went to YouTube and everyone was watching thriller over and over and over again.

266
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,351
Scott: Yeah, well, it's on the front page YouTube.

267
00:18:11,371 --> 00:18:11,996
Scott: They helped you out.

268
00:18:12,116 --> 00:18:12,298
Rym: Yep.

269
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:23,512
Scott: Yep But but people just don't know how to use Google and that's why I think as soon as I think it's actually be a problem For Google if people learned because they'd use Google a lot less.

270
00:18:23,552 --> 00:18:25,036
Scott: I mean Google is my search engine.

271
00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:26,160
Scott: I use it every day.

272
00:18:26,361 --> 00:18:31,700
Scott: I use it multiple times a day, but I use it a lot less than I ever did.

273
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,771
Scott: You know, I use it less and less all the time.

274
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:38,231
Rym: Well because I don't go to Google for news I go to like Farken slash dot and all those places.

275
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:43,213
Rym: Yeah, and I don't use it to find cool things I go to people that find those cool things for me and I look at those.

276
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:49,475
Scott: I go to Google when there is a Specific thing that I'm looking for like an error code from a device.

277
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,220
Rym: Yeah, I'll type that into Google.

278
00:18:51,621 --> 00:18:58,037
Scott: Yeah, like a really specific thing like, you know, I needed this kind of plug-in for this kind of.

279
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:03,300
Rym: you know JavaScript library, I mean if I want generic Pokemon porn I'll go to Bay image.

280
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:08,980
Rym: But if I want a very specific Pokemon porn like such say a Pidgeot and a Vayperion having sex, right?

281
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,989
Rym: Pidgeot and Vayporion fucking Cuz that'll narrow it down quite a bit.

282
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:16,134
Rym: and then you got to search through those.

283
00:19:16,195 --> 00:19:19,504
Scott: but yeah People just don't know how to use Google's.

284
00:19:19,624 --> 00:19:32,579
Rym: but along those lines there apparently the Iranian election and despite all the good that Twitter was doing It was a drop in the bucket compared to the number of tweets that hit Twitter in the hours after Michael Jackson's death.

285
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:39,508
Rym: now What I asked to you internet ask of you internet What did you possibly tweet others?

286
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:40,391
Rym: I mean, what did you type?

287
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,237
Rym: OMG Michael Jackson's dead.

288
00:19:42,357 --> 00:19:43,902
Rym: RT RT RT I mean what.

289
00:19:44,203 --> 00:19:46,270
Scott: well, some people were saying he's dead.

290
00:19:46,772 --> 00:19:48,960
Scott: Some people were doing like up-to-the-minute updates.

291
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,291
Scott: You know, he died still that no way.

292
00:19:51,352 --> 00:19:52,055
Scott: No, he's not dead.

293
00:19:52,115 --> 00:19:52,437
Scott: Oh, yes.

294
00:19:52,477 --> 00:19:55,512
Scott: He is Okay, it seems like he might have died of this.

295
00:19:56,115 --> 00:19:57,040
Scott: he is the night.

296
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,800
Scott: He's a link to the 911 phone call, you know, the constant updates like that, right?

297
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,830
Rym: The thing is if you want those constant updates you go to again.

298
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:04,733
Rym: either subscribe.

299
00:20:04,754 --> 00:20:10,766
Rym: only one person needs to do it But if only one person did it we wouldn't have these Tens of thousands of trees.

300
00:20:10,986 --> 00:20:23,153
Scott: the other thing is that some people, you know, we're posting their personal feelings, you know, like good He's dead or Oh Sorrow or his link to my favorite Michael Jackson vid or you know, it

301
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:33,890
Rym: just saddens me that the Possibility of a popular revolution in Iran of an oppressed Persian people rising up Gets less tweets than a pop star.

302
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,260
Scott: That's just the demographic of the users of Twitter.

303
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:41,538
Rym: It is it is and but at the same time the users of Twitter are looking at the Orion election as being.

304
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:44,951
Rym: you know Look Twitter is doing something useful.

305
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:46,637
Scott: No Twitter's not doing anything useful.

306
00:20:46,838 --> 00:20:47,320
Rym: I think it is.

307
00:20:47,742 --> 00:20:50,113
Rym: Without Twitter a lot of what happened there could not have happened.

308
00:20:50,274 --> 00:20:51,480
Scott: No would have been fine.

309
00:20:51,741 --> 00:20:55,551
Scott: There's plenty of well other technologies that can be used.

310
00:20:56,193 --> 00:20:58,660
Rym: I disagree strongly, but that's not the topic tonight.

311
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,605
Rym: So well, I'll let it slide but I don't think you're right.

312
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:10,780
Rym: Yeah, but anyway things of the day.

313
00:21:12,261 --> 00:21:14,329
Rym: I found this on FARC, but it was in gadget things.

314
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:27,428
Rym: I'm sure many of you have seen it already, but I Find it interesting from this sort of macabre perspective and I've heard people talk about Yes Someone they made

315
00:21:27,448 --> 00:21:28,894
Scott: macabre on a gadget

316
00:21:29,357 --> 00:21:29,879
Rym: a clock

317
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:31,103
Scott: Cthulhu clock

318
00:21:31,143 --> 00:21:41,720
Rym: that powers itself by catching and killing flies and then converting their bodies into fuel That is then turned into electricity to continue to fuel the death machine.

319
00:21:42,965 --> 00:21:44,119
Scott: What if there's not enough flies?

320
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,498
Rym: Well, eventually it'll run out of power.

321
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:53,420
Scott: Uh-huh, what if it has like enough flies to run a little bit but not enough flies to actually kill any more flies?

322
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:59,522
Rym: Because the fly killing mechanism is basically just flypaper and whenever a fly gets stuck to it It rolls.

323
00:21:59,662 --> 00:22:00,405
Rym: after the fly dies.

324
00:22:00,465 --> 00:22:04,400
Scott: it rolls it into the bacterial vat, but doesn't need enough power to roll the fly.

325
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:09,940
Scott: Yep, but if it doesn't have enough to roll the fly into the vat, well then like any carnivorous being it dies.

326
00:22:11,383 --> 00:22:16,992
Rym: I mean if you run out of power to roll this thing Get you can't power this thing solely on flies.

327
00:22:17,012 --> 00:22:18,197
Scott: you need to sort of.

328
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,640
Scott: you know Give it some initial battery power or something.

329
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:26,439
Rym: Well much like the umbilical cord gives you some initial power to get starting before you start eating.

330
00:22:29,986 --> 00:22:31,826
Rym: There's something Fascinating

331
00:22:31,846 --> 00:22:36,899
Scott: thing is unlike an actual clock You can just like replace the battery you like dump a bunch of flies in there to kick

332
00:22:37,684 --> 00:22:39,395
Rym: Or just live in a place where there are flies,

333
00:22:39,617 --> 00:22:39,899
Scott: I guess

334
00:22:41,381 --> 00:22:51,700
Rym: It's a concept more than anything, but it's one of those things where you look at it, and it's really cool But it's vaguely unsettling for a number of kind of ill-defined reasons.

335
00:22:53,243 --> 00:22:54,552
Scott: I don't see what's unsettling.

336
00:22:54,572 --> 00:22:55,820
Rym: I think it's a little bit unsettling.

337
00:22:55,901 --> 00:23:04,669
Rym: I mean it think about this This is the early prototype of a machine that can continue in its existence Only by killing living things and taking their energy.

338
00:23:05,091 --> 00:23:06,877
Rym: that is just like ten steps from Skynet.

339
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:08,925
Scott: It's alright It's a clock.

340
00:23:09,528 --> 00:23:12,040
Scott: for now, it's countdown till Judgment Day.

341
00:23:14,221 --> 00:23:28,439
Rym: You know it was always shocking every time I watch Terminator 2 again that the Judgment Day was so far in the past Kind of like October whatever 1997 the end day in Crystalis something like that.

342
00:23:29,584 --> 00:23:31,471
Rym: Yeah, I think this is cool, but that's all I got.

343
00:23:31,491 --> 00:23:47,839
Scott: so some dude went to Russia Which is awesome like people do when people do and he went to all of the Russian art museums or at least the big awesome ones right and He did a photo essay And what he took pictures of was not the art.

344
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:51,860
Scott: well He did take pictures of the art, but in those pictures of the art.

345
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,556
Scott: He was primarily focusing on the guards in the Russian art museums.

346
00:23:56,717 --> 00:23:57,560
Scott: That's pretty cool.

347
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:05,000
Rym: No, I know you know how museums always have like guards who are protecting all the arts Two guys standing next to the important painting with the hands behind their backs looking at you, right?

348
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:09,238
Scott: Apparently though in the Russian art museums all the guards are old ladies with nothing better to do.

349
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:12,459
Scott: Here's a quote from one of the old ladies.

350
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:16,175
Rym: Wait so the guy basically went around Russia taking pictures of old ladies.

351
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:26,199
Scott: a woman in Moscow State Shretakov Gallery Museum said she often returns there on her day off to sit in front of a painting that reminds her of her child.

352
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:33,980
Scott: at Another guard travels three hours each way to work since at home She would just sit on her porch and complain about her illnesses as old women do.

353
00:24:36,701 --> 00:24:48,020
Scott: So I mean you look at these pictures right and it's it's pretty amazing because you got like these old ladies You know sitting next to like this amazing arts, but at the same time the old ladies are like arts themselves.

354
00:24:48,683 --> 00:24:51,454
Scott: You know it's pretty it's pretty impressive.

355
00:24:51,514 --> 00:24:56,060
Scott: and also now I just want to go to Russia and tour the art museums.

356
00:24:56,561 --> 00:25:02,640
Scott: Cuz you look at these art museums, then it's like all man's All man's like I go to these museums and see what else they got.

357
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:05,974
Rym: I have not finished touring all of the New York City museums.

358
00:25:06,154 --> 00:25:11,937
Scott: I know it's not easy But yeah, I want to go to the Russian art museums big time.

359
00:25:11,957 --> 00:25:13,184
Rym: well Maybe you should do that.

360
00:25:13,264 --> 00:25:14,811
Scott: I mean look at this statue here with like.

361
00:25:14,872 --> 00:25:16,600
Scott: it's like it looks like Neptune or someone.

362
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,385
Scott: It's got a big Neptune like beard anyway.

363
00:25:18,987 --> 00:25:19,729
Scott: It's looking pretty good.

364
00:25:19,749 --> 00:25:21,093
Scott: Uh-huh all right.

365
00:25:21,835 --> 00:25:23,159
Scott: Oh, there's a nice pillar, okay?

366
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:29,492
Scott: so Today's show we're gonna talk about some HTML fives and rims.

367
00:25:29,512 --> 00:25:33,231
Scott: that he doesn't know about HTML 5 so much mostly I have not read.

368
00:25:33,252 --> 00:25:34,040
Rym: you know I know about it.

369
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:39,800
Rym: It's coming mm-hmm, and I just I haven't read in depth all of the like the actual standard.

370
00:25:39,961 --> 00:25:41,949
Rym: I haven't read any of the white papers about it.

371
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:45,364
Scott: the thing is you don't need to know any of those things unless you're an HTML writer.

372
00:25:45,565 --> 00:25:58,880
Scott: the thing is there are three things that people who are actually Internet people need to know about HTML 5. right and those things are canvas video and audio right Right now not the fact that it's no longer in the SGML family.

373
00:25:59,604 --> 00:26:00,891
Scott: I don't know if it is or if it isn't.

374
00:26:01,052 --> 00:26:02,340
Rym: it is not big deal.

375
00:26:02,642 --> 00:26:05,159
Rym: It's similar to SGML, but it is no longer as GMM.

376
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,960
Scott: It doesn't really matter in term.

377
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:08,118
Scott: You know who's using an edge.

378
00:26:08,642 --> 00:26:11,775
Scott: You know people always worry about that kind of stuff like I'll use X HTML.

379
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:15,988
Scott: who is really using XML parses to go and grab X HTML pages?

380
00:26:16,028 --> 00:26:20,540
Scott: who's really using like SGML parsers - no one's doing that kind of stuff all right.

381
00:26:20,901 --> 00:26:23,134
Rym: Despite that they did make it backwards compatible.

382
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:24,140
Scott: Yeah, okay?

383
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,633
Scott: But anyway, so canvas video and audio these are three things you need to know about.

384
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:31,125
Scott: let's start with the canvas because that's probably The least exciting right?

385
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:32,709
Scott: basically here's the deal with canvas.

386
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:43,254
Scott: canvas has actually been in Firefox and some other browsers for a while But no one's used it because not enough browsers Supported it and supported it in the same way and supported it in a good way.

387
00:26:43,314 --> 00:26:44,680
Scott: so no one really did anything with it.

388
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,021
Scott: You know it's.

389
00:26:45,262 --> 00:26:50,243
Scott: it's one of those all of these three things in fact all of HTML 5 is you know it's one of those chicken Egg problems.

390
00:26:50,303 --> 00:26:54,120
Scott: right until all the browsers support it nobody will write in it.

391
00:26:54,421 --> 00:27:02,419
Scott: And as long as most people are still using old browsers right then You know people still won't write in it or if they do write in it.

392
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:18,296
Scott: They'll make sure to have some sort of switch that looks at what browser you're using and not use it if you're using the old browser and Thus people have no reason to upgrade their browser because everything still works with the old browser And you know such-and-such it takes forever to get ahead and like didn't it?

393
00:27:18,316 --> 00:27:19,480
Scott: with new web stuff, right?

394
00:27:20,283 --> 00:27:23,295
Scott: But the canvas it has been around it's still around.

395
00:27:23,315 --> 00:27:32,325
Scott: what it is is Normally when you do an HTML you can do like a table an image right you know some text a paragraph That kind of stuff.

396
00:27:32,787 --> 00:27:39,060
Scott: a canvas lets you have a vector drawing area And you can use JavaScript to draw in this area.

397
00:27:39,762 --> 00:27:47,963
Scott: So you can go online and you can find like Wolfenstein 3d done in canvas And this is with no browser plugins whatsoever You know.

398
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:58,812
Scott: and you can do vector drawing and it involves SGML and which is a XML format for storing vector images and such and this sort of.

399
00:27:58,892 --> 00:28:05,561
Scott: really you know pretty much goes directly after flash But only these sort of vector drawing applications of flash you know.

400
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:10,737
Scott: so you could make a video game and canvas or you could make home star runner and canvas.

401
00:28:10,797 --> 00:28:19,905
Scott: you know that that sort of stuff and HTML5 canvas is in there, and it's gonna be you know full-on thing And it's it's gonna be interesting to see.

402
00:28:19,945 --> 00:28:22,252
Scott: you know our browsers actually going to.

403
00:28:22,272 --> 00:28:29,480
Scott: you know support the canvas in the identical way Or people gonna be driven nuts that the canvas is like different in the different browsers.

404
00:28:29,681 --> 00:28:31,270
Scott: You know this kind of thing.

405
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,200
Scott: and also what is flash gonna?

406
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,756
Scott: Do you know I mean all those websites out there that use flash for like.

407
00:28:38,238 --> 00:28:38,920
Scott: you know drawing?

408
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,640
Scott: You know how many stupid websites out there?

409
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:46,386
Scott: You go to that are like you know they like the front page is all flashed up But it's just for like logos.

410
00:28:46,446 --> 00:28:50,580
Rym: something like this has been a long time coming just in that flash originally was intended.

411
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,646
Rym: Well, you know remember shockwave.

412
00:28:52,887 --> 00:28:58,623
Scott: well flash isn't from shockwave flash is from that other thing yeah, but separate sorts of things.

413
00:28:58,663 --> 00:29:05,909
Rym: it was the idea that you know people wanted to have very much control over what was displayed and they wanted to Do these cool things that they couldn't do.

414
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,740
Rym: and we kind of got these?

415
00:29:08,381 --> 00:29:15,479
Rym: proprietary Products becoming the de facto standards as opposed to having an open just standard for doing that sort of thing.

416
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:22,277
Rym: and The fact that it took this long to get anything that is actually a real standard for it really is it's.

417
00:29:22,498 --> 00:29:25,367
Rym: it's not necessarily Surprising, but it is a little bit saddening.

418
00:29:25,648 --> 00:29:28,680
Scott: Yeah, and the thing is with the canvas right?

419
00:29:30,043 --> 00:29:33,937
Scott: It's it's sort of you know limiting and you know also freeing.

420
00:29:33,977 --> 00:29:37,643
Scott: at the same time You know we can get away from the browser Plugins.

421
00:29:38,006 --> 00:29:53,994
Scott: you know we might be able to do like better implementation of these things Mobily speaking you know which is more and more the mobile browsers are really what's important But at the same time it's like okay Do we really need like someone drawing all this crazy shit in our web page?

422
00:29:54,315 --> 00:29:55,660
Scott: all people are gonna make canvas ads.

423
00:29:56,562 --> 00:29:58,814
Scott: It's good at you know, and it's it's not a plug-in.

424
00:29:59,155 --> 00:30:01,899
Rym: well that is one thing I was thinking about the way canvas works.

425
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:08,220
Rym: It'll be much easier to create inline ads that are not easily blocked and are also totally crazy.

426
00:30:09,284 --> 00:30:10,657
Scott: You know all over the you know you know.

427
00:30:10,697 --> 00:30:14,131
Scott: right now If you can make an animated gif wait till you see like some you know.

428
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:19,619
Scott: so freeform vector advertisements You know and you can also load images in there, too.

429
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,628
Scott: So you know be totally out of control.

430
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,379
Scott: basically flash ads that are not a plug-in

431
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:47,391
Rym: but at the same time it it opens up an interesting situation where people in our generation and younger are so used to not seeing advertisements at least tech people that If this sort of technology gets to the point to where ads are intertwined with the content such that they cannot be removed easily I See a mass migration away from ad supported media entirely mm-hmm.

432
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:50,560
Scott: now is the the video and the audio tags.

433
00:30:50,861 --> 00:30:54,915
Scott: They're pretty much the same thing right and they have the same sort of issues and that you know.

434
00:30:54,976 --> 00:31:05,505
Scott: for as long as web browsers Been around I mean even in Netscape - you could have audio and or you know not video necessarily But you get of audio in a web page You know and video came later.

435
00:31:05,525 --> 00:31:11,147
Rym: remember the old MIDI file juice that he's made it real easy to do right and that The only way to do it back.

436
00:31:11,207 --> 00:31:13,134
Scott: Then was you would pretty much.

437
00:31:13,234 --> 00:31:18,880
Scott: Just you know do You know an embed tag to the file?

438
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:23,194
Scott: And then it was up to your browser to have a plug-in right.

439
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,659
Scott: so you had to install a plug-in if like.

440
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:28,280
Scott: if you didn't Have any plugins your browser would be like hey, there's an mp3 embedded.

441
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:40,580
Scott: I don't know what to do with it But if you did have a plug-in like say QuickTime plug-in and that was associated with Mp3 then your browser would load the QuickTime plug-in and the QuickTime plug-in would get the mp3 and it would be in your page.

442
00:31:40,881 --> 00:31:45,359
Rym: But I mean back in the day there was a long period where this basically just did not work for the majority of people.

443
00:31:45,379 --> 00:31:48,645
Scott: well because everyone had a different plug-in and That's the reason.

444
00:31:48,686 --> 00:31:54,760
Scott: you know this technology still works right and in fact You know it would work, but people don't use it on web pages anymore.

445
00:31:54,860 --> 00:32:00,359
Scott: And the reason is this and that okay, let's say I embed an mp3 in my page right okay?

446
00:32:01,821 --> 00:32:09,320
Scott: Problem number one is That it's you know if you have QuickTime, and he's got Windows Media Player, and he's got something else.

447
00:32:09,782 --> 00:32:18,060
Scott: You know it's gonna look different for each person because all the plugins look different I mean, and it's gonna totally break my website if your thing is too big or too small.

448
00:32:18,261 --> 00:32:20,348
Rym: It's got a navbar in a weird place.

449
00:32:20,368 --> 00:32:21,733
Scott: It's gonna look wicked ugly right.

450
00:32:22,456 --> 00:32:24,689
Scott: so no one wants to do that you know.

451
00:32:24,871 --> 00:32:31,980
Rym: and Second of all it, but at the same time people don't want every website to install a special plug-in for them.

452
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,044
Rym: Cuz people don't trust right?

453
00:32:33,105 --> 00:32:37,324
Scott: if you don't have the plug-in it's gonna bother you and say hey you got install plug-in to play this mp3.

454
00:32:37,364 --> 00:32:38,415
Scott: that's in the page.

455
00:32:38,436 --> 00:32:43,251
Scott: and The other thing is browsers don't all handle it intelligently either.

456
00:32:43,491 --> 00:32:44,755
Scott: some of them are auto playing.

457
00:32:44,775 --> 00:32:46,360
Scott: you got to turn off autoplay turn.

458
00:32:47,063 --> 00:32:48,088
Scott: It's a nightmare right.

459
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:54,393
Scott: so what everyone seems to do these days is again They use flash for audio and video even though flash is originally.

460
00:32:54,413 --> 00:32:56,380
Scott: you know the vector drawing the canvas thing.

461
00:32:56,962 --> 00:33:02,440
Scott: So it's sort of like HTML 5 is doing these three things to kick flashes ass out of the head of the game.

462
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:11,592
Rym: Well, there are a lot of smaller more subtle changes like I noticed just in my cursory readings that they've broken out div into a Few very useful divisions.

463
00:33:11,733 --> 00:33:17,091
Scott: Yeah, yeah That doesn't make it any difference for the end user no it doesn't.

464
00:33:17,111 --> 00:33:23,789
Rym: but for a developer and just for usability that having a Navbar tag that is defined and accepted.

465
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:26,620
Rym: Yeah, I think that that should have been in HTML.

466
00:33:26,781 --> 00:33:30,622
Rym: Yeah, I mean from the beginning when I learned HTML 3 What did you do?

467
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:36,240
Rym: you had four frames or something like that and you made this like hacked together navbar in the top?

468
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,693
Scott: Yeah, but anyway the video and the audio tags are an interesting situation.

469
00:33:40,814 --> 00:33:45,127
Scott: right a little bit more interesting to the canvas Is is pretty much standardized.

470
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:46,852
Scott: You know it's a vector drawing thing.

471
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,256
Scott: You know these.

472
00:33:48,296 --> 00:33:49,820
Scott: you use JavaScript to control it.

473
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,562
Scott: That's it right.

474
00:33:51,245 --> 00:33:52,970
Scott: the video and audio are a little different.

475
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:53,673
Scott: because okay.

476
00:33:53,793 --> 00:33:55,840
Scott: We're gonna put a video tag in an audio tag.

477
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:02,880
Scott: they're gonna point at a video file or an audio file and You know there's not gonna be no plug-in involved.

478
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,311
Scott: It's up to the browser to play these files and provide.

479
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:06,792
Scott: you know the.

480
00:34:07,053 --> 00:34:11,047
Scott: so basically just like plugins before Right so the browser does it.

481
00:34:11,147 --> 00:34:11,629
Scott: so it's not.

482
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:16,130
Scott: it's not a separate thing right cuz you realize most browser crashes or because of plugins.

483
00:34:16,574 --> 00:34:19,447
Scott: right and Everyone has like a different plug-in.

484
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:22,159
Scott: that screws shit up and who knows what these things are doing.

485
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,199
Rym: So I think part of the problem is it looks like they have not defined what codex.

486
00:34:27,043 --> 00:34:28,047
Scott: This is what I'm getting to.

487
00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:28,268
Rym: well.

488
00:34:28,309 --> 00:34:31,020
Rym: There's a apparently there's some gigantic shit storm on the internet.

489
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:33,344
Scott: This is the shit storm I was about to discuss.

490
00:34:33,645 --> 00:34:41,819
Rym: all right the early draft that said and I quote user agent should support the og Theora video and og verb is audio yes, and then they basically took that out.

491
00:34:42,221 --> 00:34:44,536
Scott: Yeah, so is is the problem right?

492
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:45,260
Scott: is okay?

493
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:54,966
Scott: So if the web browser is going to have allow this video and audio tag right then the web browser has to include the Codex at least the decoding parts.

494
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:58,476
Scott: you know of the of the codex for some video and audio formats.

495
00:34:58,536 --> 00:35:02,551
Scott: right all right already trouble I mean already trouble which formats mp3.

496
00:35:03,033 --> 00:35:03,716
Scott: You know I mean a IFF.

497
00:35:05,761 --> 00:35:12,986
Rym: And remember a lot of these formats are still encumbered by patents and while they are effectively de facto free They're not legally free.

498
00:35:13,327 --> 00:35:14,811
Rym: yep, and trouble could come.

499
00:35:14,871 --> 00:35:20,970
Scott: there's also the situation of you know the CPU power That is necessary to process some of these video files.

500
00:35:21,312 --> 00:35:23,640
Scott: There is the situation of you know okay?

501
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:31,875
Scott: Maybe my computer is less powerful And I want to get like a lower you know bitrate version of the file coming into me because I got a 56k modem.

502
00:35:31,895 --> 00:35:34,520
Scott: or You know.

503
00:35:35,401 --> 00:35:40,100
Rym: Basically as far as I can tell what happened was all the parties involved could not agree on anything.

504
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:41,900
Rym: So the standard does not specify anything.

505
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,860
Rym: Yeah, it went from a should cuz remember in like RFCs and things like that language means very specific things.

506
00:35:48,281 --> 00:35:51,866
Rym: So there is should must must not cannot.

507
00:35:51,886 --> 00:35:56,044
Rym: you know all those sorts of language and should is Very powerful.

508
00:35:56,124 --> 00:36:00,279
Rym: should basically means that unless you can't you must yep.

509
00:36:01,194 --> 00:36:04,310
Scott: so Yeah, so it's like which codec do we use?

510
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:10,315
Scott: so there's a big push for ogg theora Which is a very full open source codec of video and audio.

511
00:36:10,355 --> 00:36:11,620
Rym: of course who was pushing it?

512
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,295
Rym: I mean all the big companies were not pushing it.

513
00:36:14,778 --> 00:36:16,004
Rym: well No goal was pushing.

514
00:36:16,044 --> 00:36:16,807
Scott: the thing is they didn't.

515
00:36:16,828 --> 00:36:20,614
Scott: really you know the big companies really don't care too much What the codec is.

516
00:36:20,716 --> 00:36:20,939
Scott: well?

517
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,665
Scott: What they do care is they want.

518
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:26,196
Scott: they want the best quality with the least space to save on bandwidth.

519
00:36:26,216 --> 00:36:30,774
Rym: well Apple and Nokia Both strongly fought against using ogg.

520
00:36:31,196 --> 00:36:36,060
Scott: yeah well there You know Apple pretty much owns age 264 so they have an interest.

521
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,086
Scott: But other people don't have too much interest.

522
00:36:38,387 --> 00:36:42,398
Scott: you know as long as it's lower bandwidth higher quality is what people care about.

523
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:45,625
Scott: yeah But you know it's like.

524
00:36:45,946 --> 00:36:50,000
Scott: well the ogg is open source and a different bit rates is different qualities.

525
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,928
Scott: And you know if someone has a bunch of videos now.

526
00:36:51,948 --> 00:36:54,800
Scott: They're gonna have to re-encode them all to be in the right format.

527
00:36:55,061 --> 00:36:57,716
Rym: Well there's also the trouble that ogg is not.

528
00:36:57,736 --> 00:36:58,460
Scott: it's also the art.

529
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:04,360
Scott: You know there's the wrapper file, and then there's also the video codec and the audio codec in the video file.

530
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,860
Scott: It's like this big mishmash, which a lot of people don't understand people like my MK V's.

531
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:10,343
Scott: It's like well What's in your MK V's?

532
00:37:10,403 --> 00:37:11,286
Scott: anything could be in there.

533
00:37:11,547 --> 00:37:12,350
Scott: my avi is.

534
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,334
Scott: anything could be in there.

535
00:37:13,635 --> 00:37:14,799
Scott: it could be an avi with an?

536
00:37:15,721 --> 00:37:17,468
Scott: mp3 and an HD 6-4 in there.

537
00:37:17,528 --> 00:37:25,009
Scott: it could be a. it could be an a. it could be an MK V with like You know Like an eggs vid and a and a frickin.

538
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,974
Scott: you know AAC in there.

539
00:37:27,075 --> 00:37:27,616
Scott: you never know.

540
00:37:27,636 --> 00:37:29,040
Rym: well people don't understand all that.

541
00:37:30,507 --> 00:37:32,980
Rym: You shouldn't expect people to have to understand how that all works.

542
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,024
Scott: No, and there's another thing.

543
00:37:34,044 --> 00:37:37,539
Scott: is you know there's a lot of people who make web pages who don't really?

544
00:37:38,681 --> 00:37:38,983
Scott: Understand.

545
00:37:39,304 --> 00:37:42,139
Scott: you know fully what's going on and you know?

546
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:48,844
Scott: HTML 5 will make it a lot easier for those people to just be like video this audio that right But they're they're.

547
00:37:48,945 --> 00:37:53,219
Scott: they'll be smart enough to do a video and audio tag and that'll be a lot easier for those people.

548
00:37:53,259 --> 00:38:06,720
Scott: then You know embed or flash or who knows what we you know anything that we currently using But it'll be much more difficult for those people to get their stuff in the right Codec and to host it properly so that they won't get totally crushed.

549
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,041
Scott: Yep,

550
00:38:07,182 --> 00:38:14,004
Rym: I mean remember back in the day when mp3s first hit the world and you often had to quote Uncook them

551
00:38:14,305 --> 00:38:14,565
Scott: yep

552
00:38:14,886 --> 00:38:25,360
Rym: because browsers couldn't deal with them and web servers Apache the mom types Weren't set up weren't recognized people they would download as ASCII files that would include all this garbage.

553
00:38:25,462 --> 00:38:26,484
Rym: Yeah It was.

554
00:38:26,746 --> 00:38:35,615
Rym: there was a long period where you had to download mp3s and then half the time you would have to run special applications to pull all of the Binary garbage data out of them in order to listen.

555
00:38:36,038 --> 00:38:37,304
Rym: yeah And we're good.

556
00:38:37,685 --> 00:38:41,500
Rym: the thing is I don't think that'll be a problem that the cooking isn't gonna be a problem.

557
00:38:41,641 --> 00:38:44,254
Scott: Well, I think mine is probably aren't gonna be a problem.

558
00:38:44,274 --> 00:38:53,779
Rym: my expectation is that all the formats that are commonly used on the internet will just work in every browser and Ogg will work in Chrome and nothing else.

559
00:38:55,324 --> 00:38:56,113
Scott: Yeah, it's it's gonna.

560
00:38:56,153 --> 00:39:01,080
Rym: Maybe Firefox will support Ogg, but no one else was gonna be a weird situation.

561
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:13,225
Scott: You know everyone's basically you know in this attempt to make the web easier right and just allow me if let's say We got the whole world to switch It would be a beautiful thing because if you were making a web page You can just be like video.

562
00:39:13,526 --> 00:39:16,860
Scott: the file is at this URL and boom there'd be the video in your page.

563
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,204
Scott: You could specify width and height.

564
00:39:18,585 --> 00:39:28,320
Scott: you could use JavaScript to like do stuff to the video because that's another thing right is that Right now if you're using a plug-in basically anything in a plug-in is invisible to the rest of the world.

565
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,506
Scott: That's why Google can't search within flash.

566
00:39:30,907 --> 00:39:34,237
Scott: right you can't like use JavaScript like you know.

567
00:39:34,397 --> 00:39:35,240
Scott: make flash.

568
00:39:35,562 --> 00:39:38,440
Scott: You know boxes do stuff really too much.

569
00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:46,527
Scott: But now you'll be able to like fully do stuff with the audio and video Tags with JavaScript.

570
00:39:46,547 --> 00:39:47,912
Scott: so for example all right.

571
00:39:48,032 --> 00:39:49,858
Scott: I've always wanted to make it right.

572
00:39:49,939 --> 00:40:01,433
Scott: where On our page there was one audio player and clicking different links on the page would load up different files in the audio player In HTML 5. that's trivial.

573
00:40:01,634 --> 00:40:05,790
Scott: with JavaScript It's like a joke, but with right now with flash.

574
00:40:05,911 --> 00:40:07,115
Scott: You know with a flash player.

575
00:40:07,135 --> 00:40:07,657
Scott: It's a nightmare.

576
00:40:08,138 --> 00:40:08,640
Scott: It's forget it.

577
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,544
Scott: It's not even gonna happen.

578
00:40:09,805 --> 00:40:11,713
Scott: You know I guess it's possible, but it's not worth it.

579
00:40:11,934 --> 00:40:16,980
Rym: It's possible in the way that Crazy people will make it work, but it's not worth it, and it'll break anyway.

580
00:40:17,201 --> 00:40:21,011
Scott: Yeah, so you know this is actually going to make web pages.

581
00:40:21,071 --> 00:40:33,470
Scott: You know if people use it a lot more dynamic It's gonna make the video and the audio like you know an integrated part of the web experience and not this sort of Application that happens to be stuck in the middle of a web page.

582
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:36,060
Scott: the way quake live happens to be stuck on a web page.

583
00:40:36,503 --> 00:40:38,700
Scott: You know it's actually gonna be part of the web page.

584
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:44,882
Scott: Google's probably gonna be able to you know get its hands into it a little bit more for the searching and all that kind of Business.

585
00:40:45,425 --> 00:40:49,660
Scott: you know it's gonna be pretty exciting, but Is it gonna happen?

586
00:40:50,621 --> 00:40:52,072
Scott: It's it's you know right.

587
00:40:52,213 --> 00:40:57,933
Scott: in the short term Everyone's gonna have to code up even more difficult web pages because they had to put all these.

588
00:40:58,395 --> 00:41:07,240
Scott: if old browser do flash if New browser do this if this browser do the different codec, and it's basically making things worse before they get better.

589
00:41:07,963 --> 00:41:09,609
Rym: But that is there any other?

590
00:41:09,689 --> 00:41:12,380
Rym: I mean we have to push forward and we have to make new standards.

591
00:41:12,542 --> 00:41:13,558
Rym: We have to make this stuff work.

592
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:18,855
Rym: So doing this now is better than doing it later because the longer we wait the harder it gets.

593
00:41:19,016 --> 00:41:28,511
Rym: really the more entrenched these proprietary closed third-party you know self-interested Codex codex and formats and markup languages become.

594
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:39,154
Scott: yeah, I mean it's gonna be real bad for Adobe I think because basically you know flashes is powering video on the web right and Silver light is sort of in a distant distant distant.

595
00:41:39,175 --> 00:41:39,778
Scott: second place.

596
00:41:40,543 --> 00:41:47,555
Scott: Basically if the video once the video tag is there I mean think about most of the uses of flash on the web now are for video playing.

597
00:41:47,595 --> 00:41:59,304
Scott: you know I mean if They take video away from Adobe flash is only gonna be used for you know games Pretty much, and then if people actually start doing canvas games That's it.

598
00:41:59,344 --> 00:42:02,796
Rym: not just canvas, but you know also unity and things like that flash is well.

599
00:42:02,837 --> 00:42:11,294
Rym: It's still a plug-in There's no, but the difference is flash is Primarily it's kind of this very generic often difficult to work with like.

600
00:42:11,354 --> 00:42:17,253
Rym: it's a tool that can do a lot of things like Java But it's not particularly good at doing many of those things.

601
00:42:17,473 --> 00:42:20,485
Rym: people just use it because it's the only Alternative.

602
00:42:20,526 --> 00:42:21,494
Rym: it's the most well-known.

603
00:42:21,534 --> 00:42:25,374
Rym: it just works But you have to really kind of bend it backwards to make it do a lot of things.

604
00:42:25,394 --> 00:42:31,172
Scott: the thing is you know I wonder Cuz flash does do a few things most notably right flash.

605
00:42:31,232 --> 00:42:34,019
Scott: You know has the webcam kind of support going on?

606
00:42:34,521 --> 00:42:37,320
Scott: Yeah, so you can like you know make a YouTube video.

607
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:41,440
Rym: Should we have a webcam tag that just embeds the webcam from a local device?

608
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,080
Scott: Well, I think no there shouldn't be a webcam tag.

609
00:42:45,542 --> 00:42:51,442
Scott: There's nothing to do with HTML, but there should be a JavaScript way of Accessing.

610
00:42:51,743 --> 00:42:58,404
Scott: you know cuz right now with JavaScript right and and web pages you can get input from the keyboard Via the form elements.

611
00:42:58,424 --> 00:42:59,688
Scott: you know text inputs right.

612
00:42:59,988 --> 00:43:17,134
Scott: you get input via the mouse based on where they click in a canvas or Clicking on radio buttons or check boxes or submit buttons or links right, but we need more ways in JavaScript of getting input from the user and we need I think we should.

613
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:30,431
Scott: the next step in JavaScript should be audio and video input capture from the user and then allowing to stream that data back to The server or process it with the JavaScript locally on the.

614
00:43:30,632 --> 00:43:39,335
Scott: you know the users machine something like that in the long run And you stream it back You know with some sort of Ajax ish thing to the server and do stuff like that.

615
00:43:39,355 --> 00:43:42,586
Rym: well something like that in the long run Will I think really change the web?

616
00:43:42,606 --> 00:43:46,940
Rym: because right now look at YouTube even as it stands how many people will just have?

617
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,540
Rym: Conversations back and forth by making videos.

618
00:43:49,729 --> 00:43:53,137
Rym: Yeah What if that was just that worked with every like that sort of thing happened.

619
00:43:53,178 --> 00:43:56,730
Scott: you could also also be a JavaScript way of capturing input from.

620
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:10,837
Scott: you know all sorts of other devices like game pads or Touch screens if you know they'd have a special touchscreen thingy Touch pad things like sharing desktops and sharing vector graphics and shared workspaces yep.

621
00:44:12,723 --> 00:44:14,931
Scott: So I think that's that's what has to come.

622
00:44:14,992 --> 00:44:21,495
Scott: you know after HTML 5 we need to get JavaScript to have support for more different kinds of user input.

623
00:44:21,536 --> 00:44:30,459
Rym: there are basically all these Simple things that would be very useful for the internet, but companies have made products that do those things just well enough.

624
00:44:31,362 --> 00:44:37,760
Rym: But eventually all of those companies will be made completely obsolete by standards that just do what these companies make a product to do.

625
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,791
Scott: It's just so weird.

626
00:44:38,831 --> 00:44:40,161
Scott: It's like It's.

627
00:44:40,322 --> 00:44:51,373
Scott: it's basically we have we made these operating systems for computers, and then we made browsers right and then in the browser We're slowly making the whole operating system again in the browser.

628
00:44:51,393 --> 00:44:53,320
Scott: to where the browser is becoming the operating system.

629
00:44:53,381 --> 00:44:55,339
Scott: It's like why don't we just make you know?

630
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:01,300
Scott: Why don't we just take a step back and make the operating system the browser where all that work is already done?

631
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,190
Rym: Well, I think that what you know?

632
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:05,502
Rym: people always wonder what web 3.0 is gonna Be like.

633
00:45:05,542 --> 00:45:08,300
Scott: we have the same piece of software running on top of itself effectively.

634
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,846
Scott: It's like okay everyone.

635
00:45:09,887 --> 00:45:25,008
Scott: you run windows you run Linux you run Mac and that talks to your hardware And then everyone runs a web browser on top of that which allows us to have this common platform of JavaScript and HTML which is really what everyone's using nowadays even though It's you know and that it's

636
00:45:25,088 --> 00:45:25,349
Rym: like.

637
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:30,600
Rym: but here like I was saying everyone says you know web 3.0 is gonna be the semantic web, and I think that's too far out.

638
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,800
Rym: That's gonna require AI and all sorts of crazy things.

639
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:39,056
Rym: I think what web 3.0 would be which is much more feasible is to where the OS.

640
00:45:39,217 --> 00:45:40,360
Rym: there is no more browser.

641
00:45:40,781 --> 00:45:47,360
Rym: The OS is just integrated online all the time and instead of you don't you know get rid of this idea.

642
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,414
Scott: You can't tell a web application apart from a regular app.

643
00:45:50,434 --> 00:45:51,640
Rym: There aren't even websites.

644
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,746
Rym: You're just interacting through.

645
00:45:53,806 --> 00:45:56,213
Rym: you have an interface that just interacts with data.

646
00:45:56,434 --> 00:45:58,380
Rym: some of it is local some of is shared.

647
00:45:58,782 --> 00:46:02,400
Rym: Everyone is a server and a receiver simultaneously all the time.

648
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,644
Rym: There's no hosting.

649
00:46:03,665 --> 00:46:04,167
Rym: you don't go to.

650
00:46:04,187 --> 00:46:05,957
Rym: like you know libsyn host mp3s.

651
00:46:06,741 --> 00:46:15,500
Rym: I'm listening to an mp3 that someone else is sharing right now in their web browser and Chatting with four other people and all our computers are just connected to each other in real time.

652
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,303
Scott: You know we should do.

653
00:46:16,584 --> 00:46:20,320
Scott: see that's a. that's a good vision for the distant future.

654
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,825
Scott: But you know we should do is you?

655
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:23,772
Scott: just make that happen in a lab.

656
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:26,924
Scott: get like ten computers and just make it happen And it's in a lab.

657
00:46:27,085 --> 00:46:34,079
Rym: dude you realize how often now you know when I was at RIT There are all the research labs for like like IT research at RIT.

658
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:37,534
Rym: Yeah, and I always kind of looking and be like I wonder what those people are doing.

659
00:46:37,574 --> 00:46:40,884
Rym: and you know I didn't really get involved Almost every day.

660
00:46:40,904 --> 00:46:45,260
Rym: I would kill to be back at RIT and have access to those labs to do stuff like that.

661
00:46:45,461 --> 00:46:47,480
Rym: Yeah, because that's what those kids are doing right now.

662
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,291
Rym: I should have gotten into the academia, but I didn't.

663
00:46:49,613 --> 00:46:50,620
Rym: I wanted to make money.

664
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:54,639
Rym: I wanted to have a job and look where I got a lot of money.

665
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:01,634
Scott: Yep That's alright, so yeah HTML 5 be on the lookout.

666
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:08,000
Scott: and of course you know You know upgrade your browser as anyone to listen to this site is upgrading their browser.

667
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:12,013
Scott: But you know upgrade your browsers as soon as you can to get the HTML 5.

668
00:47:12,013 --> 00:47:14,060
Rym: goodness actually my company is doing something cool.

669
00:47:14,181 --> 00:47:25,808
Rym: Right we you know we need IE because all the enterprise crap supports I even silverlight now so we have to use it, but we have software to update people's pcs Because everyone smart uses Firefox.

670
00:47:26,309 --> 00:47:32,507
Rym: we the update software is going to go through and anyone who's installed Firefox It will forcibly update them regularly.

671
00:47:32,527 --> 00:47:33,992
Rym: all right keep them up to date.

672
00:47:34,012 --> 00:47:42,117
Scott: Okay, not opera though But yeah keep updating your browser so you can get the HTML 5 goodness.

673
00:47:42,198 --> 00:47:49,230
Scott: and basically You know try to get other people to upgrade their browsers, too So we can get away from flash and the old web.

674
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:56,660
Scott: because the sooner everyone starts using HTML 5 browsers the sooner You know web developers will see aha look at these web stats.

675
00:47:56,961 --> 00:48:02,323
Scott: There's only 10% of users still using IE 7 & 8. that means we can go ahead Hooray, and they'll.

676
00:48:02,464 --> 00:48:06,967
Scott: you know they'll stop doing the old stuff, and they'll stop supporting all the old crap And they'll be happy.

677
00:48:07,491 --> 00:48:08,198
Scott: so make us happy.
