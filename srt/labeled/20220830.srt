1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,612
Rym: It's Tuesday, August 30th, 2022.

2
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:11,793
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,601 --> 00:00:14,120
Rym: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,465
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,505 --> 00:00:19,299
Rym: Tonight we are talking about single-player tabletop games.

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,218
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:39,426
Rym: So, uh, sometimes, uh, the Blades in the Dark game that we started playing, not Scott, but me and a bunch of other people at the start of quarantine, uh, so long ago, coincides with Tuesday GeekNights, and sometimes, depending on our schedule and modulus math, it is opposite.

8
00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:42,080
Rym: Tuesday GeekNights, but tonight it is actually opposite.

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,360
Rym: It is actually happening right after GeekNights, meaning I do have a hard limit on this show, but I don't think we'll run into any problem.

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:01:07,840
Rym: But I gotta say, I made me realize, this is by far not the longest tabletop RPG campaign I've played in terms of hours or even sessions, because anything I do in the rest of my life is going up against Rym in middle school and high school having fucking nothing to do, but play D&D for like 12 hours literally every Sunday.

11
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:15,038
Scott: Right, so if you play even, what, 1, 2, 3 hours every other week, it's like 12 hours.

12
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,500
Scott: You gotta do 3 or 4 sessions just to catch up with one old session.

13
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,260
Rym: I had like one campaign that lasted 3 years of high school almost every Sunday.

14
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:34,800
Rym: It was... never mind all the shit we did at RIT, you know, in those lounges, so... But as an adult, it is actually... I love tabletop RPGs.

15
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,440
Rym: It's a topic that Scott and I talk about a lot on GeekNights.

16
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,900
Scott: Even though I haven't played one in a very long time.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,420
Rym: The first PAX panel we ever did was called Beyond Dungeons & Dragons, where we had a lot of big opinions about tabletop RPGs.

18
00:01:48,940 --> 00:02:03,400
Rym: And I gotta say, it is profoundly refreshing to play a long-running campaign, because a lot of the systems we've played and we talk about, they're great for one-offs, but one-offs are sort of their own thing.

19
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,759
Rym: And there are actually RPGs that are designed to do a one-off really well.

20
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:16,780
Rym: But Blades of the Dark and Burning Wheel in particular are two games that I think really only shine and you really get to flex them and see exactly how well designed they are.

21
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:25,355
Rym: If you play a long campaign that goes from the low sort of early power levels all the way up to as far as the game is designed to go...

22
00:02:26,582 --> 00:02:36,320
Scott: And of course, that's something that's common to I think a lot of tabletop RPGs, especially the ones with big books, is that you just want to use all the parts of the book.

23
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,020
Rym: Oh my god, as a kid with that Dungeons & Dragons cyclopedia, which isn't even the good old game?

24
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:48,780
Scott: Regardless of how good the game is or whatever, it has all these parts in the book and it's like you're only ever using a small section of those parts.

25
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,720
Scott: It's like anytime I can use a new part of the book, that in itself is fun.

26
00:02:54,061 --> 00:03:02,758
Scott: So a lot of RPGs, the ones that are designed for long campaigns, have parts of the book that are like, "Oh, here's the progression

27
00:03:02,798 --> 00:03:03,079
Scott: rules.".

28
00:03:03,321 --> 00:03:05,249
Rym: I mean, D&D Cyclopedia had the keep rules.

29
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,589
Rym: "Hey, you want to run a keep?

30
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,997
Rym: Here's how to run a

31
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:11,299
Rym: keep.".

32
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:19,600
Scott: Right, it's like all these rules of that nature just don't come into play unless there's multiple sessions.

33
00:03:20,946 --> 00:03:24,019
Scott: If a game has those rules, you want to play multiple sessions.

34
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:25,702
Rym: But

35
00:03:25,843 --> 00:03:33,395
Scott: if a game doesn't have those rules, it's like if you play one session, you actually used all the pages in the book pretty much, then it's like,

36
00:03:33,415 --> 00:03:34,580
Scott: "Alright."

37
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:41,440
Scott: You don't feel that need to, you know, not that it's, you know, you couldn't or you might not enjoy it.

38
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,600
Rym: Well, case in point, Burning Wheel.

39
00:03:42,841 --> 00:03:44,680
Scott: It's that strong urge is not there.

40
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,459
Rym: A one-off in a short session does not have, like, there's no cycle of Arda.

41
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:59,039
Rym: You get some Arda, you're going to use all your Arda by the end, you're going to blow your whole wad by the end of whatever session you're playing, no matter what mechanics might exist to further that.

42
00:04:01,802 --> 00:04:13,940
Rym: So, I'm not going to tell the story of our Blades in the Dark game, but what I will say is that we have played a game where the Powder Ghosts, some basically shit-tier little group of mostly bad people who are causing problems on purpose,

43
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:17,959
Scott: so far every Blades in the Dark game ever.

44
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:24,520
Rym: We've risen to the level of being a strong Tier 3, like, we're stronger than the cops now.

45
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,920
Rym: Like, we actually are a large criminal enterprise, and we have played the entire way there.

46
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,480
Rym: In fact, our current season that we're playing tonight, we just got out of prison.

47
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,379
Rym: We were all in prison for three years.

48
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,380
Scott: How are you so strong if you were in prison?

49
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:45,416
Rym: Because we were pretty fucking strong when we went into prison, and you realize there's rules for playing in prison.

50
00:04:45,436 --> 00:04:46,500
Rym: There's holdings in prison.

51
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:54,140
Scott: I'm sure there are, you know, you ever see like a Mafia boss, he's in prison, but usually it's only one or two guys in the prison as like sort of taking turns.

52
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,295
Scott: It's not like everyone...

53
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:03,120
Rym: We had sparks in the gang, some people were outside of prison, like our goons were outside of prison, we had some ghosts outside of prison, but we were in prison.

54
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,660
Scott: If all the leaders are in the prison, that's going to be the end of your little family, right?

55
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,180
Scott: But if, you know, some in, some out, okay, that's fine.

56
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,567
Rym: You realize there is a holding.

57
00:05:11,628 --> 00:05:19,740
Rym: you can get in the regular rules of Blades in the Dark, in Iron Hook Prison, where you control a cell block top to bottom, that is your lair.

58
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:30,679
Scott: Sure, but you, you know, you gotta, if you're not interacting and holding power from within the prison upon the outside world, that's not, you know...

59
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:44,600
Rym: Oh yeah, so right now we're, our sessions are around, we are back in the real world and we're checking on what all our underlings were up to and how the Empire is going and making some corrections, let's say, to what happened while we were in prison.

60
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:52,196
Rym: But, the whole, from session one, I looked at those prison rules and I was like, "I gotta, I gotta get into that fucking prison, I wanna play those

61
00:05:52,256 --> 00:05:52,538
Rym: rules.".

62
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,524
Rym: We played 'em.

63
00:05:53,846 --> 00:06:07,817
Rym: We have touched almost all the rules and, uh, I cannot recommend Blades in the Dark enough as a system if you want to tell fun stories but do not want to have to prepare basically at all as a game master if you don't want to.

64
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,460
Rym: So, uh, a little geek bite before we get into the news.

65
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,879
Rym: I, uh, did play a bunch more of Cult of the Land because, you know, we talked about it on another GeekNights, it's...

66
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:19,219
Scott: I haven't actually played it yet.

67
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,580
Rym: It's, uh, it is exactly what I thought it was.

68
00:06:22,901 --> 00:06:35,560
Rym: It really, honestly, struggles from the Actraiser problem in that half of it is a cute and fun but very simplistic Sim town and the other half of it is just Binding of Isaac with melee.

69
00:06:36,082 --> 00:06:47,720
Rym: It's, like, less good Hades, I hate to say, and that's basically 90% of the gameplay is Binding of Isaac-style Hades, like, almost directly.

70
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,220
Rym: And, like, as cute as the game is, like, I'm probably gonna beat it at least once because this game is absolutely adorable.

71
00:06:54,781 --> 00:07:08,200
Rym: Every part of the style and the story is great, the Sim town is fun, but the gameplay itself, uh, just like Binding of Isaac, I am bouncing off of it with increasing, uh, vertical altitude as I bounce further.

72
00:07:09,141 --> 00:07:15,587
Scott: Hmm, at least based on what you said, taking it in good faith, right, it reminds me a bit of Recettear, the game with the... Yeah.

73
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,420
Scott: Right, and in that game, it's like, "Oh, running the shop,".

74
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,680
Scott: but actually, a large portion of that game is just low-quality action RPG stuff.

75
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:38,650
Scott: Like, you gotta go, you hire a hero and you go out and you do really crappy Secret of Mana Zelda-style hit monsters, right, to collect loot to sell in the shop, and it's like, "Just remove that part of the game.

76
00:07:38,993 --> 00:07:40,180
Scott: Shop only," right?

77
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,720
Rym: Honestly, Cult of the Lamb town only would be better than Cult of the Lamb.

78
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,980
Scott: Right, and Cult of the Lamb, it's like they sold it on the Animal Crossing part, at least in the stuff that I saw, the buzz I heard.

79
00:07:50,620 --> 00:08:02,060
Scott: So, if it's true that only a small portion of it is the Animal Crossing part, or if it's an Actraiser where the town part is only half the game, it's like, "Why did you put this other game in there?

80
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,254
Scott: Just make the one game that you are.

81
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:08,378
Scott: that's the good part, polish that, expand it, don't go throwing some other thing on

82
00:08:08,398 --> 00:08:08,478
Scott: top.".

83
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,320
Rym: But I guess what's really bugging me is, like, Binding of Isaac was fine.

84
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,023
Rym: I played it.

85
00:08:12,365 --> 00:08:13,392
Rym: It was an okay game.

86
00:08:13,472 --> 00:08:14,740
Rym: A lot of people got really into it.

87
00:08:15,184 --> 00:08:16,280
Rym: People are getting into Cult of the Lamb.

88
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:28,980
Rym: It's just, they both share a very loose and floaty control style, and it is almost the polar opposite of the tightness of the timing of Hades.

89
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:35,499
Rym: And that is what's bugging me personally about it.

90
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:38,753
Rym: So, I think you should play it at some point.

91
00:08:38,773 --> 00:08:40,080
Rym: I think we should do a full review of it.

92
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:54,500
Rym: I want to beat it before I pass full judgment, but my initial experience is, I don't want to say this game is all style, no substance, but the style is so good compared to the substance that it's actually kind of irritating me.

93
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,039
Rym: I almost want to just play Animal Crossing that looks and feels like this.

94
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,620
Scott: There are many games with a lot of style and no substance for you to enjoy.

95
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,236
Rym: I mean, there's many things on Earth that are like that.

96
00:09:05,256 --> 00:09:05,840
Rym: Remember Noir?

97
00:09:06,982 --> 00:09:07,725
Scott: Yeah.

98
00:09:08,288 --> 00:09:08,570
Scott: All right.

99
00:09:09,052 --> 00:09:10,620
Scott: So, in the news, right?

100
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:23,736
Scott: Unknown Worlds Entertainment, the game development studio that brought you such classics as Natural Selection 1, Natural Selection 2, I kind of want to play that again.

101
00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:24,260
Rym: It's been a while.

102
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,950
Scott: Subnautica, which I haven't played, but is lauded.

103
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,306
Rym: You should play it in VR.

104
00:09:29,326 --> 00:09:32,780
Rym: I can lend you a VR headset.

105
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,323
Scott: That's okay.

106
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:36,980
Scott: They have a new game coming out soon.

107
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,199
Scott: It is going to the planned release date.

108
00:09:41,422 --> 00:09:46,000
Scott: It's confusing because Steam says early access on it, right?

109
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,751
Scott: You can't actually get it early access yet.

110
00:09:48,831 --> 00:09:52,729
Scott: It says release date September 29th, which I thought it was going to be yesterday.

111
00:09:52,749 --> 00:09:53,734
Scott: I misread it.

112
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:54,538
Scott: It's a month from now.

113
00:09:55,941 --> 00:09:59,719
Scott: Is that going to be early access then, or is it going to be release release then?

114
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,700
Scott: There's a play now button for the play test, right?

115
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:11,264
Scott: But that play now button is there because I already requested to join the play test, and I was accepted.

116
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:19,340
Scott: But even though I was accepted, I still cannot download or play because the play test hasn't started yet, but there's still a play button.

117
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:24,120
Scott: But anyway, there are videos and screenshots and descriptions of this game.

118
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:32,620
Scott: What it is, it is a turn-based combat game, you know, like a Warhammer type, right?

119
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,126
Scott: Mini miniatures, right?

120
00:10:34,488 --> 00:10:44,280
Scott: But even though it's a video game, it's presented as if there was a tabletop game that was this, but it's not.

121
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,877
Rym: That is intriguing to me.

122
00:10:46,502 --> 00:10:51,340
Scott: Like, you know, an XCOM, when you move a dude in XCOM, that's a dude, right?

123
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:56,060
Scott: Imagine if a dude in XCOM had a little base around his feet.

124
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:59,939
Scott: It was a miniature, not a dude, right?

125
00:11:02,242 --> 00:11:11,590
Scott: The thing that's most fascinating to me is that they actually are going to try to simulate the full miniatures game experience.

126
00:11:11,811 --> 00:11:15,220
Scott: You can paint the miniatures digitally, right?

127
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:21,916
Scott: It's like, they're really going all out with this, you know, "There is a miniatures game called Moonbreaker, and you're playing it

128
00:11:21,957 --> 00:11:22,399
Scott: digitally.".

129
00:11:22,901 --> 00:11:40,080
Rym: Now, that is what I am so intrigued by, because if I lived in a house, and it wasn't COVID times, and I had more free time, so already there's a lot of ifs there, I would have so many fucking miniatures for miniature fucking combat type games.

130
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:41,839
Rym: I actually really love that stuff.

131
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,760
Scott: I definitely have a lot of nerdy shit that I didn't have now.

132
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,136
Scott: But, yeah, this game, is it going to be good?

133
00:11:48,156 --> 00:11:48,738
Scott: Is it going to be bad?

134
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:49,160
Scott: Who knows?

135
00:11:49,360 --> 00:12:03,899
Scott: Another interesting fact about the game is that, you know, much like Netrunner, the original Netrunner was set in the Cyberpunk universe, the same one that the Cyberpunk video game, Cyberpunk 20, whatever the RPG was in, right?

136
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,060
Scott: The R. Talsorian Cyberpunk universe.

137
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,900
Scott: The Android Netrunner was called Android Netrunner because it was set in the Android universe.

138
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:19,880
Scott: Fantasy Flight Games created that universe just to have some intellectual property to make games on, right?

139
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,120
Scott: Rather than always licensing things.

140
00:12:24,021 --> 00:12:26,060
Scott: And likewise, they made the Key Forge universe.

141
00:12:27,661 --> 00:12:32,280
Scott: Here, right, Unknown Worlds has taken the same cue.

142
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:45,900
Scott: They have created a new fantasy sci-fi universe in which to put their game so that they don't have to license any IP, and they hired Brandon Sanderson.

143
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:52,220
Rym: The guy who, if you somehow don't know, was given the mantle of finishing the Wheel of Time.

144
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:54,083
Scott: Yeah.

145
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,779
Scott: Didn't he also write many D&D novels?

146
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,093
Rym: Oh yeah, he's got a lot going on.

147
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:00,200
Rym: There's a lot.

148
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,207
Rym: Go to Wellington's Wikipedia.

149
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:04,760
Rym: There's way more than just the Wheel of Time.

150
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,500
Rym: Though the Wheel of Time, I think, is the only works of his I have read.

151
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:18,880
Scott: Anyway, Brandon Sanderson was in charge of creating the fictional sci-fi universe in which this miniatures game takes place, yet it's all a video game.

152
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:35,820
Scott: I am hopeful with obviously zero expectations, but this has the potential, at least, to become a game that I could invest myself in with some significant amount of time.

153
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:41,060
Rym: Okay, this could be a lifestyle game, or at least a long-haul game, if it's good.

154
00:13:41,941 --> 00:13:44,560
Scott: It could be a game that you get other people to play easily.

155
00:13:44,941 --> 00:13:48,795
Scott: It doesn't seem like it has any microtransaction BS.

156
00:13:48,856 --> 00:13:49,980
Scott: that's not cosmetic.

157
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:53,978
Scott: You can paint the minis, so I don't know what the hell cosmetic shit there would be.

158
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:55,616
Scott: Just paint them.

159
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:00,740
Rym: The only thing I have to decide, do I try to paint them to look good?

160
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:07,040
Rym: Or do I do what I did as a kid and paint them badly, kind of on purpose, because I don't care, and make that my aesthetic?

161
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,406
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

162
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:09,979
Scott: I think that's the self-expression.

163
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,064
Rym: I want the aesthetic of.

164
00:14:11,145 --> 00:14:13,174
Scott: I literally dipped this in thinned paint.

165
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,880
Scott: But I think this is a game that I could get people to play with me, right?

166
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:20,256
Rym: Oh yeah.

167
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:22,580
Scott: If it's any good.

168
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,767
Scott: So I'm excited for.

169
00:14:23,908 --> 00:14:25,219
Scott: Moonbreaker is the game.

170
00:14:26,183 --> 00:14:27,379
Scott: Look for it on Steam.

171
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:32,440
Scott: Maybe next month we can play it, if that's your jam.

172
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,280
Rym: Yeah, and some other news.

173
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,379
Scott: Before we learn that it's crap and stop playing it.

174
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,060
Rym: So there's a lot going on in the story I'm about to talk about.

175
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:46,660
Rym: But what was fascinating to me is that I curate the media I follow very tightly.

176
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,500
Rym: I don't follow that many Twitter accounts.

177
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:52,300
Rym: I have very specific places I go to get the internet.

178
00:14:53,242 --> 00:15:00,920
Rym: And this is one of those situations where I encountered the debunking of a thing before I encountered the bunking.

179
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:02,199
Scott: That happens a lot.

180
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:12,480
Rym: In fact, the bunk never at any point entered my social circle, except some of our own friends responding to my debunking with skepticism.

181
00:15:13,382 --> 00:15:13,542
Scott: Right.

182
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:22,040
Scott: Well, I mean, so I think that happens a lot when you are someone who does call and really highly curate your media feed.

183
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,815
Rym: You see a bunch of you see like anyone, right?

184
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:35,480
Scott: It's like granny source, any source that is going to, you know, propagate bunk or create bunk information is not going to be in your feed.

185
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,008
Scott: But debunkers, right?

186
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:41,720
Scott: Truthful people are probably going to be in your feed.

187
00:15:42,302 --> 00:15:46,540
Scott: And because of their original content that they're creating, just because they have.

188
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:53,100
Scott: But if some some bunk happens in their field of interest, then you might see them debunk something.

189
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,317
Scott: You'd be like, what are they debunking?

190
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,260
Scott: Yeah, because some garbage you don't follow because it's garbage.

191
00:15:57,381 --> 00:15:58,474
Rym: That's like using me.

192
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,780
Rym: I think a lot actually to find to find out that a black hole exists.

193
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,620
Rym: Like you see all this stuff, all these tweets orbiting something, but you've never seen the thing.

194
00:16:08,061 --> 00:16:17,540
Rym: And that's when you type a Google search, like you take a bunch of random keywords from all these tweets just to see what the fuck everyone's talking about, because everyone talking about it assumes you have seen the bunk.

195
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:29,780
Rym: So some garbage-cheered news outlet like GLHF reported that Amazon was buying electronic arts.

196
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:33,108
Scott: I mean, that's believable, given the state of the world.

197
00:16:33,228 --> 00:16:37,759
Scott: And we know that electronic arts was seeking to be bought or might still be.

198
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,280
Rym: So this is where I have specialized knowledge.

199
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,079
Scott: And Amazon is big enough to buy them, though.

200
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,066
Rym: It was not.

201
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:48,260
Rym: It was not believable in that particular time.

202
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:56,800
Rym: You know, a few days ago in this particular place for a lot of reasons that if you pay attention to M&A and corporate stuff would be obvious.

203
00:16:57,001 --> 00:17:02,220
Rym: Also, this kind of thing would not be broken by an outlet like this.

204
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:11,460
Rym: This kind of thing would be picked up by financial analysts based on data and chatter long before it hit any journalists.

205
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:20,900
Scott: Well, it would also be reported by more than one place and by reputable places and not some website no one ever heard of before today.

206
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:30,100
Rym: So what I want to do, one, what I'll link to is Jason Schreier actually tore this fucking story apart, just sublimely.

207
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,519
Rym: And you can read his Twitter thread to see exactly what went down.

208
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,080
Scott: I feel like this place actually got what, you know, it's like, they actually succeeded.

209
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,438
Scott: It's like, we didn't know who they were, now we know who they are.

210
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,940
Rym: All I have to say to good luck, have fun, is good luck, have fun.

211
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:52,660
Rym: So not only did they fuck up, but USA Today, which I guess republish it, like uses them as a contributor.

212
00:17:54,081 --> 00:18:00,840
Scott: People don't realize Forbes, the website Forbes, which seems legit because it was originally a magazine, it was originally a rich dude.

213
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:05,587
Scott: It was a legitimate publication of sorts.

214
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:11,120
Scott: You can just pay money basically, effectively, to just publish things on Forbes.com.

215
00:18:12,321 --> 00:18:15,920
Rym: There's a lot of things like that, like Bob's Guide is like that, there's all these websites.

216
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,933
Scott: USA Today, the newspaper, is like a real newspaper.

217
00:18:20,194 --> 00:18:21,740
Scott: You get it in hotels usually, right?

218
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,522
Scott: But it's a network.

219
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:35,260
Scott: There are small journalistic outfits around the country, and maybe around the world also, that are all part of the USA Today network.

220
00:18:35,721 --> 00:18:44,940
Scott: And it's like, the actual USA Today can basically republish the things that those other places publish, and they're all connected somehow loosely.

221
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,762
Scott: I don't really fully understand it.

222
00:18:47,283 --> 00:18:59,160
Scott: But it's like, USA Today itself, their journalistic integrity standards are not universally applied to all of those little outfits, right?

223
00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:01,340
Scott: Which are operating independently.

224
00:19:02,022 --> 00:19:08,380
Rym: USA Today disavowed them, threw them under the bus, edited their story to remove all that nonsense.

225
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,303
Rym: So you can read this story.

226
00:19:10,323 --> 00:19:16,538
Rym: The part I actually want to speak to is, how was I so 100% sure this was fake?

227
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:24,060
Rym: Because I can outline a heuristic, you can follow our favorite word, that's very simple for this kind of news.

228
00:19:24,662 --> 00:19:30,880
Rym: Number one, if there is a news of any kind, the bigger the story, the more this applies.

229
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:37,553
Rym: And there is only one primary source reporting it, and all the rest of the news.

230
00:19:37,653 --> 00:19:40,960
Rym: people are talking about it, but they're all citing that one.

231
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,639
Rym: Like, it's all a circle and it all points back to one website.

232
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:59,920
Rym: If that is it, and there is not only no second source, but also there is no background chatter whatsoever, like rumblings that were happening for a while, chatter in professional circles related to this.

233
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:12,260
Rym: Not only is the story probably false, but the fact that there is no chatter and that there is only one source implies that the story is probably the opposite of what is actually true.

234
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,659
Rym: And in fact, someone might be trying to directly manipulate you.

235
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:26,660
Scott: Yeah, I have seen several instances of the only one weird website is reporting something, and then other people somehow start talking about it, and it all links back to the one place.

236
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:33,333
Scott: And in 100% of the instances that I have seen so far in my life, the news was wrong.

237
00:20:33,354 --> 00:20:36,340
Scott: It has never been correct, not even one time so far.

238
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:43,700
Rym: So at least wait for two separate legitimate news organizations, not like Fox News or some crap, but like real news.

239
00:20:44,421 --> 00:20:49,179
Rym: And if two of them independently report on the story, you're probably good to go.

240
00:20:49,960 --> 00:21:03,080
Rym: But the second part, if you have yourself professional connections or knowledge about the area where the news is happening, like in this case, corporate M&A, I actually have some experience with.

241
00:21:03,421 --> 00:21:07,560
Rym: Financial stuff, like I have access to lots of interesting data, I can check on some of this.

242
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:13,000
Rym: You might have access to what we call chatter, which is basically non-reportable background noise.

243
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:19,920
Rym: Like, you might see, oh, inside of, I don't know, the Bloomberg Terminal, there's a bunch of rumors that have been circulating for months leading up to this.

244
00:21:20,421 --> 00:21:28,120
Rym: Or you might be in a Discord with a bunch of game devs, and people are talking about this situation before that news happens.

245
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:34,480
Rym: If there is a Ukraine war, the news didn't break that Russia had fully invaded Ukraine right away.

246
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:44,120
Rym: But if you were filtering sources like FARC and looking at the overall background chatter, there was a shape to that chatter that implied something way bigger was happening.

247
00:21:45,687 --> 00:21:52,240
Scott: If that is true... Yeah, we were talking about like, you know, Russia, are they going to invade question mark for like weeks, months maybe even?

248
00:21:53,001 --> 00:21:57,960
Scott: And then when it actually happened, the news wasn't, oh my god, they did it, you know, it happened.

249
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,960
Scott: It was, oh, they did it, it actually happened now.

250
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:02,880
Rym: So here's your rules.

251
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,478
Rym: Surprise.

252
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,980
Rym: If there are two sources that are legitimate, talk about it in public if you feel like you must.

253
00:22:08,401 --> 00:22:19,740
Rym: If there is one source plus chatter and you have esoteric or expert or professional knowledge in this area, you can talk about it or investigate it.

254
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:24,520
Rym: But I would highly advise you to not do so publicly because you don't have anything real.

255
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,720
Rym: Chatter is not news.

256
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,640
Rym: Chatter is chatter.

257
00:22:27,061 --> 00:22:30,140
Rym: That is where you go to your private Discord and talk about it to your friends.

258
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,419
Rym: Like, hey, what do you think is going on with this?

259
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:36,480
Rym: But you don't like tweet about it because you're just going to contribute to the disinformation.

260
00:22:38,621 --> 00:22:47,800
Rym: And if you're not sure if you have enough knowledge of chatter and journalism to talk about something even among your friends, maybe just wait for the news.

261
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,400
Rym: Like, don't spread misinformation.

262
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,600
Rym: That's pretty much the best way to go in these situations.

263
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:58,039
Rym: But no, EA is not being bought by Amazon at this time.

264
00:23:00,871 --> 00:23:01,868
Rym: So some other news.

265
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:04,729
Rym: Looks like we're going to get from Disney.

266
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,549
Rym: Ravensburger appears to be involved in this.

267
00:23:09,211 --> 00:23:19,190
Rym: They're publishing a trading card game called Lorkana, which the marketing copy helpfully explains is a portmanteau of lore and arcana.

268
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:20,587
Scott: I didn't know that.

269
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,168
Scott: I couldn't.

270
00:23:21,492 --> 00:23:22,850
Scott: Oh, that makes sense.

271
00:23:23,393 --> 00:23:24,290
Scott: I did not know.

272
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:25,704
Rym: Breaking news.

273
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:28,488
Scott: What a shocker.

274
00:23:28,912 --> 00:23:29,063
Rym: It's.

275
00:23:30,499 --> 00:23:30,869
Rym: We'll see.

276
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:37,430
Rym: I feel like much like with Key Forge, Scott and I are definitely going to get a get some cards and poke at this so we can talk about it.

277
00:23:37,671 --> 00:23:38,233
Rym: That's a good night.

278
00:23:38,434 --> 00:23:39,921
Rym: I'll pay 20 bucks.

279
00:23:40,243 --> 00:23:41,649
Rym: ish to get a good night's episode.

280
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:55,890
Rym: Yeah, you know, buy two starter decks, play a few times, you know, but it is purportedly a pan Disney trading card game and the marketing copy we've gotten so far.

281
00:23:56,291 --> 00:24:00,450
Rym: I'm just going to quote it because it is it tells you exactly everything you need to know about this game.

282
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:13,190
Rym: Quote the breadth and scope of Disney characters represented in this game will be unprecedented and it will contain more original Disney artwork than any other single product ever created.

283
00:24:15,191 --> 00:24:24,050
Rym: That implies to me that this game is not going to be much of a game or in the very least it is going to be a very hard is definitely the highlight.

284
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:24,451
Scott: Right.

285
00:24:24,471 --> 00:24:27,530
Rym: Yeah, I'm pretty sure this is going to be talked about the rules much.

286
00:24:27,992 --> 00:24:30,110
Scott: It's what every other tabletop Kickstarter does.

287
00:24:30,251 --> 00:24:33,050
Rym: I'm pretty sure this is going to be the Disney pins in card form.

288
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:46,550
Scott: Yeah, one positive I see from this is that if it's successful at all, right, is that, you know, some portion of money is going to go to a whole bunch of illustrators.

289
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:54,150
Scott: Oh, yeah, like an army of illustrators that are going to suddenly have a lot more demand for work because they need a lot of card artwork suddenly.

290
00:24:54,612 --> 00:24:59,470
Scott: Everyone who can draw a Mickey Mouse or a Spider-Man or a Star War.

291
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:04,210
Scott: Yeah, whatever other shit Disney owns now and in terms of be in work.

292
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:16,230
Rym: I think in terms of the gameplay, the best case scenario would be honestly, if this game is about the level of complexity and strategic interaction as the Pokemon card game.

293
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,609
Scott: Pokemon is a good card game.

294
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:22,470
Scott: If they can make a game as good as the Pokemon card game, this could become a real thing.

295
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:29,950
Rym: It really could, but the opposite side, it could be a pin like collector nonsense game where there's no game behind it.

296
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:33,070
Scott: There's going to be collector nonsense, you know, 100%.

297
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:42,570
Scott: So that's why even if the game is good, right, it's like I'm not going to go beyond just get two starter packs, whatever, because I know it's going to be some rando money hole.

298
00:25:42,811 --> 00:25:51,189
Scott: If, you know, they were actually going to go down and do the, you know, an LCG-ish model like Netrunner had where you could just buy a box and all the cards are in there.

299
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:56,670
Scott: Then I could actually, I'd be willing to deal with like a lower standard of game.

300
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:05,250
Rym: Oh no, they've already said, so it'll release in fall 2023 and there will be four sets of cards released annually, basically forever is what I can tell.

301
00:26:06,055 --> 00:26:06,950
Scott: Yup, until they stop.

302
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:14,730
Rym: Yup, so there's going to, every quarter they're going to release some cards and that worries me a little bit because.

303
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:19,470
Scott: I'm not going to make the rest of my life this game, so it's going to be a few starters in the end.

304
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:19,871
Scott: But

305
00:26:19,891 --> 00:26:38,670
Rym: I guess the danger of that statement is that if there are that many cards, especially if they continue after the first year with that many releases, that implies that the game has a very shallow Pareto frontier and that the cards will all be mechanically largely indistinct from each other.

306
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,850
Scott: No, they'll just do the same rotation shit that Magic does.

307
00:26:42,231 --> 00:26:48,350
Rym: Oh yeah, but I'm saying that they will likely not have significantly radically interesting cards unless.

308
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,609
Scott: Magic has interesting cards.

309
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:53,721
Rym: Yeah, Magic also has a very different type of game and player base.

310
00:26:54,022 --> 00:26:56,530
Rym: I do not know if this game will be complex enough to support that.

311
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,950
Rym: How often do Pokemon release entire sets of new cards?

312
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:01,590
Scott: Pretty frequently.

313
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,569
Rym: How frequently though?

314
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:03,545
Scott: Several times a year.

315
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:04,159
Scott: Now?

316
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:07,074
Scott: They rotate cards.

317
00:27:07,717 --> 00:27:10,306
Scott: You just haven't played a trading card game in a very long time.

318
00:27:10,326 --> 00:27:11,310
Scott: This is why they rotate.

319
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:19,830
Scott: Because if they don't rotate, then the Pareto frontier becomes a mess because these incredibly powerful cards sit around and you basically have power.

320
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,093
Rym: I'm not talking about game balance.

321
00:27:21,393 --> 00:27:29,150
Rym: I'm thinking more around, especially because this is a Disney game and probably aimed at kids, I worry and suspect it will be less complex than the Pokemon game.

322
00:27:29,611 --> 00:27:30,412
Scott: And who knows?

323
00:27:32,155 --> 00:27:36,682
Scott: Companies basically don't see the game mechanics as a selling point.

324
00:27:36,702 --> 00:27:41,950
Scott: They never talk about it and therefore I don't believe that they invest time into making sure that part is good.

325
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:49,490
Scott: And, you know, but it's still, this is going to be a huge thing so I'll at least poke it one time.

326
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:49,950
Rym: Yep.

327
00:27:50,351 --> 00:27:55,202
Rym: This is absolutely very likely going to be a huge thing, at least when it launches.

328
00:27:55,623 --> 00:27:56,605
Rym: And then we'll see what happens.

329
00:27:56,686 --> 00:27:58,630
Rym: But I feel like the Disney IP is too strong.

330
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:13,530
Scott: There are lots and lots of games that have shown, if you have spent any time in a game store, there are a lot of games that come and they make a big splash immediately and might even be more popular than the bigger games.

331
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:16,054
Scott: But then they fade fast.

332
00:28:16,134 --> 00:28:18,939
Scott: I remember there was a Star Wars one with dice.

333
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:22,686
Scott: That came out three weeks or maybe a month.

334
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:24,729
Scott: People were playing it, buying it, buying it, buying it.

335
00:28:24,749 --> 00:28:25,030
Scott: Gone.

336
00:28:25,272 --> 00:28:26,460
Rym: Hey, remember in RIT?

337
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,870
Rym: Remember MechWarrior Mage Knight?

338
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,472
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

339
00:28:29,712 --> 00:28:31,235
Scott: Like this keeps happening, right?

340
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:39,730
Scott: It's like to have a game that comes into the game store and holds for any amount of time, it's like that's incredible.

341
00:28:40,111 --> 00:28:46,990
Scott: You get to level two, like the Netrunner level, where like your game is still there month after month but you're not at the magic level yet, right?

342
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:49,767
Scott: And then to get to the magic level, that's like you're set.

343
00:28:50,651 --> 00:29:01,230
Rym: Now they have said as well, they announced that there will be a robust organized play program, so we'll see what the shape of that is, but that is crucial to this kind of release, so we'll see how it goes.

344
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,925
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

345
00:29:11,005 --> 00:29:13,369
Rym: This is just a cute little animation.

346
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:19,360
Rym: It is a song sung to the tune of W-I-T-C-H by Devin Cole.

347
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:30,700
Rym: But it's Princess Peach singing about Luigi with a cute sort of puppet stop motion looking animation on it and this is 35 seconds of extremely cute content.

348
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,201
Scott: Okay.

349
00:29:33,142 --> 00:29:42,578
Scott: So, the legendary video game designer Masahiro Sakurai, who has created Kirby, like he made Kirby, right?

350
00:29:42,738 --> 00:29:43,940
Scott: He made Smash Brothers.

351
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,850
Scott: This is a legendary human being, right?

352
00:29:47,171 --> 00:29:49,640
Scott: Who will be remembered by nerds forever.

353
00:29:51,742 --> 00:30:02,080
Scott: He has done something truly incredible, maybe even this might end up being a greater work than Kirby and Smash Brothers and the other games he's made.

354
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,284
Scott: He has made a YouTube channel, right?

355
00:30:05,645 --> 00:30:12,177
Scott: And on the YouTube channel, he is posting the real deal info, right?

356
00:30:12,217 --> 00:30:13,640
Scott: With English subtitles, right?

357
00:30:18,482 --> 00:30:25,860
Scott: We always talk about how video games, you know, the really good video games are the ones that are polished a whole bunch, right?

358
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,726
Scott: They spend the extra time to get all the details right.

359
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:35,280
Scott: This is a person who has pretty much only ever made highly polished games, right?

360
00:30:35,621 --> 00:30:41,939
Scott: And he's given the lowdown and even though a lot of the stuff he's talked about so far is stuff I already kind of know, right?

361
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,486
Scott: It's like the fact that he's saying it, right?

362
00:30:45,506 --> 00:30:52,120
Scott: That someone that legendary is saying a thing that I already know and have figured out on my own is like, whoa, right?

363
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,765
Rym: So, I watched a few of these already.

364
00:30:54,845 --> 00:30:59,360
Rym: They are exactly what we expected when this channel was announced.

365
00:31:00,142 --> 00:31:06,760
Scott: Yeah, but like this might be the greatest educational resource for anyone who wants to make video games.

366
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,966
Scott: And he's uploading new videos frequently.

367
00:31:10,247 --> 00:31:12,272
Scott: The production value is extremely high.

368
00:31:12,653 --> 00:31:15,300
Scott: The videos are very short but chock full.

369
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,686
Rym: Also, they're getting longer.

370
00:31:16,746 --> 00:31:18,155
Rym: The newest one is 10 minutes long.

371
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:18,839
Rym: Risk and reward.

372
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,551
Scott: Well, that's just because that one was a topic that needed more minutes.

373
00:31:22,852 --> 00:31:23,614
Scott: It was special.

374
00:31:23,975 --> 00:31:25,480
Scott: It's not that they're getting longer overall.

375
00:31:26,001 --> 00:31:33,640
Scott: And the best one so far was the pause one where he's like, look, and he shows how like in one video game, you just sort of get hit and die.

376
00:31:34,261 --> 00:31:43,300
Scott: And in another video game, you get hit and like everything freezes for a second like to like, you know, pause as you see the impact, right?

377
00:31:43,641 --> 00:31:47,740
Scott: And it's like you think about it and it's like, oh, yeah, video games do do that all the time.

378
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,688
Scott: And that is obvious and what you should do.

379
00:31:50,271 --> 00:31:52,420
Scott: And it increases the intensity of the impact.

380
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:54,647
Scott: It makes her better game feel.

381
00:31:54,968 --> 00:31:58,840
Scott: It helps the player see what hit them, not just I'm dead mysteriously.

382
00:31:59,140 --> 00:31:59,561
Scott: Help me.

383
00:31:59,942 --> 00:32:00,142
Scott: Right.

384
00:32:00,403 --> 00:32:09,020
Scott: It's like, but you don't actually realize that, like, I never realized before watching that video that it was, oh, it's this pause that they're doing that makes that happen.

385
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:09,781
Scott: Right.

386
00:32:09,801 --> 00:32:19,620
Rym: You know, you'd have to pay really good attention to, like, know that, you know, we talked about that at length with the video ball guy when we were talking about video ball at a PAX a long time ago.

387
00:32:20,241 --> 00:32:20,521
Scott: Yeah.

388
00:32:20,581 --> 00:32:31,820
Scott: So it's like thing, all these sorts of tricks, if all, you know, and just, you know, game design know how it's like, if all that knowledge is combined in one place, I think, you know, and people actually watch these videos.

389
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:40,000
Scott: It could elevate, I think, all, you know, video game development across the use that exact mechanic just because I'm thinking about it.

390
00:32:41,021 --> 00:32:43,485
Rym: I could really use something like that.

391
00:32:44,827 --> 00:32:45,048
Scott: Right.

392
00:32:45,068 --> 00:32:52,740
Scott: Cause like how many indie games out there, you know, get these small things wrong or imperfect just not because it's hard for them to do it.

393
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:59,680
Scott: It's not like it costs more money to, you know, but it's like, just cause you don't have the experience of the person who made Kirby.

394
00:33:00,581 --> 00:33:09,974
Scott: So, uh, to be able to like advance your game industry development knowledge, like so much, uh, this is, this is a huge deal.

395
00:33:10,474 --> 00:33:14,560
Scott: I'm enjoying this YouTube channel more than ever, like maybe any YouTube channel ever.

396
00:33:17,441 --> 00:33:23,605
Rym: In the better moment, uh, I will be live at PAX West, uh, on Sunday, September 4th, coming up.

397
00:33:24,005 --> 00:33:44,060
Rym: There obviously will not be a show on Thursday cause I'm flying to Seattle, uh, Sunday, September 4th, 1230 PM Pacific time in the Sasquatch theater, which is in the Sheraton because it starts with S. the panel is losing and it is actually significantly radically different from the solo talk I gave on this topic at PAX Australia, 2014.

398
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,523
Rym: The year Scott didn't come with me.

399
00:33:45,543 --> 00:33:48,390
Rym: Uh, beyond that, the book club book is Binti.

400
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,632
Rym: We'll do that show.

401
00:33:49,712 --> 00:33:53,300
Rym: I imagine I'll just read it in all this travel and then, uh, we'll do the book club book on it.

402
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:59,840
Scott: I finished the other non book club book I was reading and therefore I can now read the Binti book probably next.

403
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,301
Scott: All right.

404
00:34:00,341 --> 00:34:01,102
Rym: We could probably do a show.

405
00:34:01,162 --> 00:34:12,239
Rym: We could do a quick show on it next week because I do have to announce in the better moment that between Emily and I biking to Rochester from New York over the course of a week, somewhere I have to visit some work offices.

406
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:25,400
Rym: Uh, I'm usually going to be out of town for packs and then I'm going to be out of town for like the two and a half weeks at the end of September to bike to Rochester and then fly to London.

407
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:31,350
Rym: Then I'm also going to be out of town the first week of October, uh, at a different office in Germany.

408
00:34:31,751 --> 00:34:37,020
Rym: So GeekNights, we'll have a significant hiatus and we'll resume the week of October 10th.

409
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,201
Scott: Okay.

410
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:44,531
Rym: I hope we can sneak in one episode, uh, next week or maybe even the following week.

411
00:34:44,591 --> 00:34:48,638
Rym: I have this like week gap that straddles two weeks between all this nonsense.

412
00:34:48,678 --> 00:34:49,739
Rym: So that's the time.

413
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,846
Scott: Even more free time for me in addition to my Fridays.

414
00:34:52,866 --> 00:34:53,427
Scott: Yeah.

415
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:58,416
Scott: So, uh, yeah, that's, uh, maybe, maybe I'll get this website more.

416
00:34:58,517 --> 00:35:00,100
Scott: I did work on it a little bit the other day.

417
00:35:01,241 --> 00:35:05,012
Rym: I got a pretty good pipeline for putting all the markers in the episodes that I got to do now.

418
00:35:05,092 --> 00:35:07,078
Rym: Like I can, I can do that real quick now.

419
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:07,960
Rym: I've been doing it on every episode.

420
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,503
Scott: Okay, good.

421
00:35:08,543 --> 00:35:11,620
Scott: Because that functionality took me like a few days to work to develop.

422
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,269
Rym: I've been doing it on every episode to make sure I have a good process.

423
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:19,039
Rym: So all the episodes we've uploaded since we last talked about that have all those markers in them.

424
00:35:19,981 --> 00:35:20,261
Scott: Okay.

425
00:35:21,463 --> 00:35:23,105
Rym: Uh, so yeah, let's just get right into it.

426
00:35:23,145 --> 00:35:32,840
Rym: So I want to point out, we did way, way back in 2007, we did an episode called Solitaire and Simple Games, which is not quite what we're talking about today.

427
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:43,640
Rym: Um, we did a recent show called The Number of Players where we talked about what are the fundamental differences between one player, two player, three plus player, and I guess zero player.

428
00:35:44,401 --> 00:35:55,860
Rym: Uh, but now we also did one show specifically on solitaire puzzles, and we did make a lot of distinctions in that episode around what is a puzzle versus a game.

429
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,304
Rym: Don't get sweaty you nerds.

430
00:35:57,344 --> 00:35:59,250
Rym: There's a very, there's a big overlap there.

431
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,695
Rym: This is not a hard definition.

432
00:36:01,337 --> 00:36:02,360
Rym: Don't worry about it too much.

433
00:36:02,781 --> 00:36:17,440
Rym: But there has been a trend that was actually relatively rare until I want to say about five or six years ago, I started seeing a lot more of them just sort of all at once, even though they definitely existed before.

434
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:27,357
Rym: But regular old looking tabletop games that are either designed for one player or have a one player variant.

435
00:36:27,678 --> 00:36:28,660
Rym: that was in the rule book.

436
00:36:29,781 --> 00:36:32,604
Scott: Yeah, I'm seeing this much more frequently, right?

437
00:36:32,765 --> 00:36:36,029
Scott: Is that, you know, there are games that are clearly, right?

438
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:37,832
Scott: You know, even look at Root, right?

439
00:36:37,872 --> 00:36:43,920
Scott: It's like Root is clearly a political multiplayer game for three plus players, right?

440
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:49,231
Scott: If you reduce root to a two player game, that is no longer a political game.

441
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:53,400
Scott: It's a completely different game, even though a lot of mechanics, you know, rules would be identical.

442
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,376
Rym: Rules were, but it becomes a local optimization game and it's just not good.

443
00:36:57,437 --> 00:36:58,240
Rym: It's not worth playing.

444
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,756
Scott: There is, you can also, they sort of do like this, you know, there's the clockwork, you know, a cat, whatever.

445
00:37:04,776 --> 00:37:06,280
Scott: I forget what they call it, right?

446
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,688
Scott: And it's like, yeah, it's like you have an AI player in there, right?

447
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:16,093
Scott: And it's like, well, what the hell is that garbage, right?

448
00:37:16,153 --> 00:37:20,660
Scott: And now it's like a one player game against, you know, a deck of cards, right?

449
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,967
Scott: Is this like pandemic?

450
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:24,260
Scott: It's a one player game against a deck of cards.

451
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:29,110
Rym: Well, you could do that with, we have two humans and that thing, and that edge is more into.

452
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:34,000
Rym: it provides a deck of cards of randomness that's controlled.

453
00:37:34,381 --> 00:37:37,426
Rym: And then the game becomes yet again, it becomes yet another game entirely.

454
00:37:37,446 --> 00:37:46,060
Rym: Now the game is which of the two players exploit the mechanics of that third bot player plus locally optimized.

455
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:46,220
Rym: Right.

456
00:37:46,581 --> 00:37:49,166
Scott: But regardless, it's a, it's a completely different game.

457
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:56,240
Scott: It's in no relation to like, you know, the game that was made, but game developers, game designers in the tabletop board game space.

458
00:37:57,121 --> 00:38:00,925
Scott: They, they feel, I believe right that they have to do this.

459
00:38:01,005 --> 00:38:14,560
Scott: They must come up with some either solo variant of their game when they publish it, because there is a large portion of, especially in, you know, the people who kickstart board games, right.

460
00:38:14,981 --> 00:38:20,569
Scott: Who are, you know, buying games for the collectible, you know, material parts, right?

461
00:38:20,629 --> 00:38:27,780
Scott: But people who have no friends, they don't have anyone to play games with, or don't have anyone to play games with frequently.

462
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:28,421
Scott: Yeah.

463
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:43,520
Scott: Or they don't have anyone to play games with nearby, or they don't have anyone who will play games of this nature with them, or will, you know, enjoy games in the same way that they do, that they could have a good experience playing the game with those people.

464
00:38:44,081 --> 00:38:54,400
Scott: And so having the solo variant in there, or, you know, making it a solo board game, like intentionally will get those people to buy the game.

465
00:38:55,081 --> 00:38:58,586
Scott: And even if they don't actually play it by themselves, right.

466
00:38:58,626 --> 00:39:03,394
Scott: The fact that they could gives themselves permissions to buy it for themselves.

467
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,760
Scott: And if they do play it by themselves, okay, they do.

468
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:12,565
Scott: And you still, by adding those extra rules, you're able to sell another copy of the game.

469
00:39:13,026 --> 00:39:25,057
Scott: And so having solo play rules in tabletop games over the past several years, I'd say five years maybe, has become extremely commonplace.

470
00:39:25,137 --> 00:39:27,800
Scott: Like I'm seeing more games with solo than without.

471
00:39:28,321 --> 00:39:39,754
Rym: Now there's nothing wrong with these modes, and some of these are pretty good, but I will fully disclose, I am not personally a big fan of these, and that I've rarely found them worth playing.

472
00:39:40,194 --> 00:39:45,100
Rym: Especially if the alternative was playing a game with my friends, like right there at the same table.

473
00:39:45,946 --> 00:39:46,320
Scott: Obviously.

474
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:59,420
Rym: So, this takes a lot of forms, and I think it's worth sort of walking through all the different things this looks like, because one example that I saw way back is Agricola had single player rules.

475
00:40:00,823 --> 00:40:02,640
Scott: What are the Agricola single player rules?

476
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:03,478
Rym: You never looked at them?

477
00:40:04,171 --> 00:40:04,256
Rym: No.

478
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,344
Rym: It's basically just play the game with some fairly arbitrary limitations to make it not stupid.

479
00:40:10,624 --> 00:40:16,769
Rym: You still get your deck of improvements, like you're sort of constrained, and it's almost more like a SimCity.

480
00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:27,316
Rym: It's more like, alright, here's the constraints, here's what you got, do the actions and follow these rules, but you're mostly playing Agricola mechanics, just with a few things.

481
00:40:27,396 --> 00:40:33,420
Rym: to force decisions, like worker placement by yourself without something else going on doesn't really mean anything.

482
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:37,765
Rym: And the game really just comes down to, try to get a high score.

483
00:40:38,066 --> 00:40:42,252
Rym: Maybe you play it again with the same seed, and see if you can optimize better.

484
00:40:42,592 --> 00:40:46,177
Rym: Can you get the maximum possible score with that seed?

485
00:40:46,758 --> 00:40:48,120
Rym: Maybe play it again with a different seed.

486
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,300
Scott: That's basically the same thing as playing Slay the Spire, if you think about it.

487
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:51,760
Rym: It is.

488
00:40:52,041 --> 00:41:13,780
Rym: I was actually going to bring up Slay the Spire as, effectively, even though it's a video game, and even though Slay the Spire technically could be a tabletop game, though, the deck of cards you would need, and the mechanics you would need to deal with all that fiddly nonsense would make it impossible, but I also guarantee there is someone out there who wants that and would play it.

489
00:41:15,751 --> 00:41:15,980
Scott: Anyway.

490
00:41:16,462 --> 00:41:18,520
Rym: I think that would be harder to play than Advanced Squad Leader.

491
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:20,600
Scott: Yeah, probably.

492
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:42,839
Scott: Yeah, a lot of solo board games are simply, they're not puzzles, right, like a Sudoku where they're, like, the true puzzle, like the pure puzzle is A) perfect information, like it's not hiding anything from you, B) there's nothing random, right, and C) there's one solution, and then once you have that solution, it's like the puzzle is done.

493
00:41:42,919 --> 00:41:43,580
Scott: Jigsaw puzzle.

494
00:41:43,981 --> 00:41:49,380
Scott: You put it together, you know, right, it's like, it's together, the end, right?

495
00:41:50,220 --> 00:42:10,200
Scott: These solo board games of this variety are optimization puzzle, right, where it's like, you do it, you always win, basically, you never lose, kinda, but you have a score at the end, and so you can do the puzzle again, and it's like, how well can you do the puzzle?

496
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:14,889
Scott: It's like, so you think, it's like jigsaw puzzle, how fast did you put it together?

497
00:42:15,129 --> 00:42:20,899
Scott: One minute, five minute, ten, you know, well I guess one minute would be better, but it's like, can you do it faster, right?

498
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,240
Scott: It's like, you know, can you in some way do it better, blindfolded, right?

499
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,260
Rym: It's like, you know.

500
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,884
Rym: Alright, here's an example, Yahtzee.

501
00:42:28,184 --> 00:42:29,507
Rym: Yahtzee supports one player.

502
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:35,140
Rym: just fine, you can just play with Yahtzee by yourself, anytime, and you know what, kinda fun, still.

503
00:42:35,341 --> 00:42:38,360
Scott: But Yahtzee has some luck to it, which puts it in a different category.

504
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,869
Rym: Well yeah, cause that's the second category, where you've got a single player game, this is what breaks it out from a puzzle.

505
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:47,720
Rym: It's either introducing randomness, so now you have to react to it, ideally.

506
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,205
Scott: Some of the optimization ones are randomness in the setup, right?

507
00:42:51,246 --> 00:42:59,940
Scott: Randomness in the setup, you could do sort of a pure optimization puzzle, but if there's randomness during the game, now that you're in a different territory.

508
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:00,320
Rym: Yup.

509
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:18,800
Rym: Some games do this, like Yahtzee, with dice, some games do it with a special deck of cards, I've seen tabletop games that are designed for like three to five players, or two to five players, have the one person variant, and usually there's a separate, special deck of cards or something that's only used for that version of the game.

510
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,863
Scott: Yeah, and that deck of cards effectively is a player.

511
00:43:22,063 --> 00:43:36,140
Scott: Like, instead of having a human make decisions, you just have a randomized deck of cards, you draw from it in some, according to some rules, maybe there's a flowchart, and it tells you what that, if there was another human there, and you weren't alone, what they would do on their turn.

512
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:52,900
Rym: Now one area that one player variants of games that do support more players, or intend more players, an aspect of this is that it can be used to learn the base mechanics and base heuristics of a broader game, without having to play with other people.

513
00:43:54,001 --> 00:43:56,339
Scott: It won't help you learn strategy though.

514
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:09,540
Rym: Nope, but like, you could play single player Agricola, and learn the ins and outs of like, irrespective of what other players might do, what's more or less powerful, like how good are sheep really in the broader meta of the game.

515
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:36,300
Scott: And if there's not a lot of player interaction, there obviously is in Agricola, right, with the blocking of workers, but there isn't much more than that, so it's like, if you can look at a particular hand of cards and play a really efficient lane on Agricola, even if someone else is blocking your spots once in a while, you'll still have a really good chance of winning, if you know how to optimize.

516
00:44:36,901 --> 00:44:53,500
Rym: But of course the danger there, well one, the danger there is that you will optimize to the easy mode, where there is no one aggressively, actively countering you or getting in your way, try to do the things that work in one player Agricola against people who know how to play Agricola and you're going to get crushed.

517
00:44:54,740 --> 00:45:01,180
Rym: But two, most people who want to do that are probably better served by just getting whatever app there is for the game.

518
00:45:02,601 --> 00:45:04,320
Rym: If there is one, just play against AIs.

519
00:45:05,344 --> 00:45:06,999
Scott: Yeah, probably, like a Carcassonne app.

520
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:13,220
Rym: Yep, I mean I still play a Dersheem of Hex and Carcassonne sometimes while I'm pooping, that's still a thing.

521
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:27,540
Scott: Especially since, you know, an app's, the quote AI in an app, especially on the hard mode, is going to be way better an opponent than, and take less time consuming than a deck of cards or flowchart opponent.

522
00:45:29,621 --> 00:45:41,400
Scott: But the thing is, these ones where there's randomness during the game, whether it's a simulated opponent or not, those ones are not a pure optimization thing.

523
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:46,947
Scott: You can't like sort of rank yourself in those because it's like you could just get unlucky, right?

524
00:45:46,987 --> 00:45:56,640
Scott: Like you could play Pandemic by yourself and it's like you lose, but it's just because the deck of cards was just really awful, they got shuffled up in such a way that like you couldn't win.

525
00:45:57,061 --> 00:45:57,823
Rym: It is possible.

526
00:45:57,863 --> 00:46:03,478
Rym: you try to play Yahtzee by yourself and you roll five ones literally every time you roll the dice all the way to the end.

527
00:46:03,498 --> 00:46:04,160
Rym: Like that can happen.

528
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,461
Scott: That can happen, right.

529
00:46:05,521 --> 00:46:14,771
Scott: So what it's really, these types of games, what they're more about is, you know, okay, here's a, random shit is going to happen, right?

530
00:46:15,051 --> 00:46:19,156
Scott: Will I get through, will I succeed this time, right?

531
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:20,077
Scott: Oh, I didn't?

532
00:46:20,297 --> 00:46:22,600
Scott: Okay, well, you know, I'll just try again.

533
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:33,100
Scott: And it's like, right, you know, the, what your play decisions, you sort of had to play the odds, you know, you might memorize all the random things that could happen, which would help you significantly.

534
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:38,046
Scott: But, you know, it's like sometimes you win and sometimes you won't.

535
00:46:38,627 --> 00:46:47,160
Scott: And okay, it's not, it's like winning and losing, I think sort of loses, you know, some sort of the emotion, right?

536
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,966
Scott: It's like, if you lose in a game like that, it's like, well, I didn't lose to anyone.

537
00:46:50,986 --> 00:46:53,931
Scott: It was kind of random.

538
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:59,040
Rym: I'm idly working on the 14th ascension with the orb guy and slay the spire, like when I laid out in bed.

539
00:46:59,240 --> 00:46:59,340
Scott: Right.

540
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,602
Scott: But that's different right there.

541
00:47:00,682 --> 00:47:07,152
Scott: It's like, okay, you know, I optimized and I did better than I did the last time on the same loadout.

542
00:47:07,453 --> 00:47:09,156
Scott: It's like, I learned something, right?

543
00:47:09,216 --> 00:47:11,840
Scott: I advanced this some sort of sense of accomplishment there.

544
00:47:12,401 --> 00:47:12,682
Scott: Right.

545
00:47:12,722 --> 00:47:13,364
Scott: That's greater.

546
00:47:13,745 --> 00:47:16,231
Scott: You know, it's like if you're playing Dig Dug, you get a new high score.

547
00:47:16,492 --> 00:47:18,216
Scott: It's like same, same deal, right?

548
00:47:18,277 --> 00:47:19,480
Scott: It's like, you feel good about that.

549
00:47:21,501 --> 00:47:22,122
Scott: You know, puzzle.

550
00:47:22,242 --> 00:47:24,244
Scott: I was, I have not been able to solve the puzzle.

551
00:47:24,765 --> 00:47:26,947
Scott: I have solved the puzzle.

552
00:47:27,068 --> 00:47:28,309
Scott: I finally figured it out, right?

553
00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:37,120
Scott: But the game with the simulated AI, with the random things that happened during the game, it's sort of like, what's the meaning of doing that, right?

554
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:42,155
Scott: Besides maybe practicing, but that practice is such a weak practice.

555
00:47:42,656 --> 00:47:43,880
Scott: It's like not helping you that much.

556
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:44,300
Rym: Yeah.

557
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:49,546
Rym: I do think a big driver of it is people lack enough people to play games with and they're desperate to play games.

558
00:47:49,946 --> 00:48:01,478
Rym: But there is also the, and I've seen a lot of people do this at PAX's pre-COVID, is they play the single player variant of a game or a single player game that's quick, just because they're waiting for their friends to finish something.

559
00:48:01,498 --> 00:48:02,479
Rym: They don't have anyone nearby.

560
00:48:02,539 --> 00:48:03,360
Rym: Like that's pretty common.

561
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:10,700
Rym: But granted, personally, I'm the kind of person who would just turn to my Switch or conversation or play a game on my phone while I waited.

562
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:21,837
Scott: I mean, if you play, you know, Klondike Solitaire, the classic solitaire, you know, Microsoft Solitaire to most people, right, is a game where it's random during, you know, it's like, you don't know the loadout, it's hidden information.

563
00:48:21,877 --> 00:48:23,780
Scott: So effectively, it's random during play.

564
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:32,028
Scott: It's not, even though it's chronologically set up randomness because they're hidden, it's gameplay randomness.

565
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:36,133
Scott: It's like, it's just an idle activity, right?

566
00:48:36,273 --> 00:48:41,318
Scott: But you don't, it's like, if you win at it, it's like, okay, if you lose at it, okay.

567
00:48:41,378 --> 00:48:42,639
Scott: It might've been an unwinnable hand.

568
00:48:42,659 --> 00:48:43,040
Scott: You don't know.

569
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,539
Rym: Well, if you win a Klondike Solitaire, you got to pick the cards up and throw them all over the room.

570
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,261
Scott: Hopefully that's their digital cards.

571
00:48:51,123 --> 00:48:51,323
Scott: Right.

572
00:48:51,363 --> 00:48:53,986
Scott: But if you are just trying to pass the time, okay.

573
00:48:54,446 --> 00:49:04,395
Scott: But if it's a more complex board game, right, you know, and you're playing a solo, you might play, you know, one use of the solo mode that could be legitimate could be just passing the time.

574
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:09,520
Scott: Like, you know, it's like, yeah, you don't put much value in it, but just keeping your mind occupied with something.

575
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:09,840
Scott: When

576
00:49:09,921 --> 00:49:22,617
Rym: I lived up in the mountains before we moved in together in Beacon and, uh, like between RIT and our future lives, I was living alone in the mountains in a rented room and I didn't have any internet and I didn't get cell reception where I was living.

577
00:49:22,878 --> 00:49:23,879
Rym: I didn't know anyone in town.

578
00:49:23,899 --> 00:49:24,640
Rym: I didn't have any money.

579
00:49:25,301 --> 00:49:43,878
Rym: And one day I set up Settlers of Catan and I played it against myself basically for an entire afternoon over and over again to simulate the concept of what if all four players had perfect intuition on the full game state and knew everything everyone else knew, what could happen?

580
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:46,000
Rym: Like, what would that game actually look like?

581
00:49:47,661 --> 00:49:54,108
Rym: And it was an interesting mathematical sort of like exploration into Settlers of like, what are the fundamental core mechanics?

582
00:49:54,629 --> 00:49:56,771
Rym: And I got some moderate enjoyment out of that.

583
00:49:57,192 --> 00:49:57,672
Rym: And you know what?

584
00:49:57,873 --> 00:49:59,935
Rym: The main reason I did it was not that exploration.

585
00:50:00,015 --> 00:50:02,057
Rym: It was that there was fucking nothing else to do.

586
00:50:02,118 --> 00:50:04,080
Rym: And I'd already read like three books that morning.

587
00:50:06,521 --> 00:50:20,320
Scott: Uh, but yeah, I guess the, another possible reason you might want the solo mode would be, it's like, you know, maybe you don't, you didn't buy the game yet, or maybe you're thinking about selling it and you just haven't played it and there's no one to play it with, right?

588
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,644
Scott: It's like, you could learn the rules that way.

589
00:50:23,664 --> 00:50:25,986
Scott: It would help you when you're teaching someone else, right?

590
00:50:26,006 --> 00:50:29,670
Scott: The real rules, or you could find out if you even like the game, right?

591
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:38,280
Scott: Because like, if you don't like the solo game, right, you can sort of intuit what the real multiplayer, real version of the game is going to be like.

592
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,161
Scott: Right.

593
00:50:39,361 --> 00:50:46,978
Scott: And sort of be able to tell, you know, if you should even attempt playing the multi, the real version or just be like, Oh, get this game out of here.

594
00:50:47,038 --> 00:50:48,121
Scott: It's not, you know, Yeah.

595
00:50:48,181 --> 00:50:56,092
Rym: The danger there though, is I have found because there are, there's an increasing breadth of games that are designed as single player from day one.

596
00:50:56,452 --> 00:50:59,997
Rym: Like maybe they have an, uh, a variant that's multiplayer.

597
00:51:00,037 --> 00:51:01,960
Rym: It's almost the inverse of how things were before.

598
00:51:02,581 --> 00:51:14,640
Rym: And when we're talking about a game that is designed for multiple players, but has a one player variant, I personally treat those as different games that are just similar and they tend to be pretty inelegant.

599
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:29,300
Rym: They tend to have to make some leaps to make single player work as opposed to the games that are designed for this, which often have extremely clever mechanics to allow you to play a game solo, especially single player RPGs.

600
00:51:30,461 --> 00:51:30,601
Scott: Right.

601
00:51:30,621 --> 00:51:30,841
Scott: Yeah.

602
00:51:31,081 --> 00:51:36,950
Scott: So I was about to say, if you are, you know, this kind of person who's got no one to play with, right.

603
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:44,220
Scott: And you know, it's like, you're looking for an activity and it's like, yeah, I could encourage you to go actually go do some other hobby entirely.

604
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:44,640
Scott: Right.

605
00:51:44,681 --> 00:51:46,224
Scott: Like you're painting or something.

606
00:51:46,304 --> 00:51:46,525
Scott: Right.

607
00:51:46,865 --> 00:51:49,511
Scott: And say, that's a better use of your time than a solo board game.

608
00:51:49,531 --> 00:51:52,357
Scott: And that's true, but you really like gaming.

609
00:51:52,397 --> 00:51:53,440
Scott: That's what you want to do.

610
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,405
Scott: You just don't have other people right now or whatever your circumstances.

611
00:51:58,045 --> 00:52:08,518
Scott: My recommendation would be to go with the solo tabletop RPGs because the solo tabletop RPG is a creative experience.

612
00:52:11,341 --> 00:52:11,522
Scott: Right.

613
00:52:11,863 --> 00:52:13,747
Scott: It's like every, I have a bunch of them.

614
00:52:13,787 --> 00:52:14,850
Scott: I've been meaning to play them.

615
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:15,271
Scott: Right.

616
00:52:15,411 --> 00:52:19,340
Scott: And it's not like I haven't because I don't have anyone to play with because they're solo.

617
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,942
Scott: It's like, it's just cause I haven't had time.

618
00:52:21,962 --> 00:52:25,546
Scott: Um, it maybe I should give one rims out anyway.

619
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:33,092
Scott: Uh, the solo tabletop RPGs, most of the ones that I have, uh, are a creative endeavor.

620
00:52:33,152 --> 00:52:38,137
Scott: You are producing a story, an artwork, uh, something right.

621
00:52:38,798 --> 00:52:41,340
Scott: Um, while you are playing this.

622
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:42,241
Scott: Right.

623
00:52:42,301 --> 00:52:44,142
Scott: And you're crafting an experience.

624
00:52:44,403 --> 00:52:48,086
Scott: It's a memory or at very least it'll be a memorable thing for you.

625
00:52:48,106 --> 00:52:48,206
Scott: Right.

626
00:52:49,047 --> 00:53:03,060
Scott: You know, that, that, you know, even though it's fictional, uh, and I feel at least personally to me, I feel that that is much more worthwhile way to spend the limited time you have on, you know, alive on earth.

627
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,121
Scott: Right.

628
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:09,088
Scott: Then to play, you know, root alone, sadly, right.

629
00:53:09,589 --> 00:53:12,193
Scott: Or like oath alone, sadly, or something like that.

630
00:53:12,253 --> 00:53:12,514
Scott: Right.

631
00:53:12,674 --> 00:53:16,720
Scott: You know, that doesn't seem to as a good use of someone's time.

632
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:24,070
Rym: You know, an example of these, there were all those choose your own adventure, adjacent role-playing books that had mechanics.

633
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:31,440
Rym: One of them, I remember that I played as a kid, just basically a choose your own adventure type book, but it had a system where you'd go to one of these back pages.

634
00:53:31,961 --> 00:53:38,448
Rym: And you would literally be told to hold the book open, hold a pencil, at least a foot in the air, close your eyes and drop it wherever it landed.

635
00:53:38,508 --> 00:53:39,750
Rym: That would be the number you rolled.

636
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:44,876
Rym: And it was just a single player RPG with leveling and an inventory and all sorts of nonsense.

637
00:53:45,176 --> 00:53:46,818
Rym: There's lots of stuff like that out there.

638
00:53:46,858 --> 00:53:48,380
Rym: And some of these date back to the seventies.

639
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:49,321
Scott: Yeah.

640
00:53:49,381 --> 00:53:58,893
Scott: I mean, you know, it might be a, uh, uh, it might've been a thing of the day way back when, but there was a, one of the things like, uh, uh, what's it called?

641
00:54:00,014 --> 00:54:01,016
Scott: Uh, crowdfunded.

642
00:54:01,036 --> 00:54:03,459
Scott: It was a solo RPG called Amending.

643
00:54:03,539 --> 00:54:04,300
Scott: It's back on the shelf.

644
00:54:04,702 --> 00:54:05,148
Rym: Oh yeah.

645
00:54:05,188 --> 00:54:06,060
Rym: The one with the sewing.

646
00:54:06,761 --> 00:54:07,061
Scott: Right.

647
00:54:07,121 --> 00:54:19,917
Scott: It's it comes with a map and you're basically, there's a deck of cards, like prompts, and you're telling a story of like your adventure and whatnot, you know, and then you're sewing into the, into this piece of cloth, right.

648
00:54:20,518 --> 00:54:21,939
Scott: The journey that you're taking.

649
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:22,460
Scott: Right.

650
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:33,134
Scott: And, you know, you could just keep it simple and just draw a path on the map, you know, with just straight thread, but it's like, it encourages you to like, let's say you, I don't know, fought a dragon.

651
00:54:33,174 --> 00:54:37,060
Scott: It's like, all right, well, embroider a little dragon symbol in that spot.

652
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:37,420
Scott: Right.

653
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,024
Scott: You know, if you can, uh, maybe learn how.

654
00:54:40,064 --> 00:54:48,137
Scott: so, you know, it's like, that's, and then at the end, you've produced this, this work, but you've also played a game, right.

655
00:54:48,157 --> 00:54:48,818
Scott: Which is what you want.

656
00:54:48,858 --> 00:54:50,040
Scott: You enjoy playing games.

657
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:51,061
Scott: Right.

658
00:54:51,081 --> 00:54:54,807
Scott: You know, you might not have just enjoyed embroidering for its own sake.

659
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,154
Scott: And there's, there's many such games like that.

660
00:54:59,174 --> 00:55:02,500
Scott: You know, I got this one more recently called you are the dungeon.

661
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:04,842
Scott: And it's like, you, you.

662
00:55:04,862 --> 00:55:13,395
Scott: basically, the game is a game where you create a dungeon, but you are, you are the dungeon a lot like in vast, you are the dungeon.

663
00:55:14,236 --> 00:55:15,478
Scott: I'm kind of excited to play it.

664
00:55:15,538 --> 00:55:16,820
Scott: I just haven't done it yet.

665
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:37,180
Rym: And one thing that I think, uh, is interesting is that a designed for single player board game or tabletop game of any kind, especially like non RPG ones are not mechanically really distinct at their core from most co-op tabletop games.

666
00:55:37,581 --> 00:55:47,420
Rym: Because, you know, we're talking about Richard Garfield and, you know, like, uh, talking about how games are actually structured, a team acts as a player in terms of most interactions.

667
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:53,209
Rym: So a game that is designed for one player arguably is equally well designed for one team.

668
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:59,360
Rym: or a co-op game is basically can be a one plus player count.

669
00:56:00,501 --> 00:56:04,628
Scott: Depending on the kind of co-op game, but yeah, it's like, I bring you up pandemic, right?

670
00:56:04,648 --> 00:56:06,692
Scott: I don't think sells itself as a one player game.

671
00:56:06,732 --> 00:56:11,000
Scott: It sells itself as a co-op game, but I've said this a zillion times.

672
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:20,800
Scott: The game, the original game pandemic, uh, is basically no different than several people sitting around a single hand of Klondike, Microsoft solitaire.

673
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:26,355
Scott: And, you know, sort of all talking to each other about like what, what to do next, right?

674
00:56:26,375 --> 00:56:27,237
Scott: Should we draw cards?

675
00:56:27,257 --> 00:56:28,220
Scott: Should we move that pile?

676
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,206
Rym: Here's my, here's my co-op RPG.

677
00:56:31,467 --> 00:56:35,380
Rym: So we play Klondike solitaire, everyone's sitting in front of the same deck together.

678
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:46,200
Rym: And to decide which car, like what the next move is, players have to play a full burning wheel session, duels of wits while the dwarf wants to make sure the ACE never gets out.

679
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:47,541
Rym: There you go.

680
00:56:47,561 --> 00:56:48,142
Rym: That's okay.

681
00:56:49,263 --> 00:56:49,744
Scott: Whatever.

682
00:56:49,764 --> 00:57:00,860
Scott: But yeah, uh, there is value, I guess, you know, just to end the show, I don't know how much more there is to say, but I think there is value in games having single player modes.

683
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,087
Scott: It certainly doesn't hurt the multiplayer mode for the single player mode to just be there.

684
00:57:05,187 --> 00:57:06,429
Scott: I'm not going to be like, get rid of that.

685
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:12,700
Scott: That's, you know, if it sells more copies of the game and it helps game designers, developers, publishers get more money.

686
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:13,962
Scott: It's like, great.

687
00:57:14,142 --> 00:57:15,525
Rym: You know, there's definitely an audience.

688
00:57:15,585 --> 00:57:17,068
Rym: There's definitely people who like these games.

689
00:57:17,689 --> 00:57:23,440
Rym: Designing a game for one player is a fascinating game design challenge for tabletop.

690
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:30,308
Scott: But I don't see, you know, the sort of non puzzle, right?

691
00:57:30,388 --> 00:57:39,500
Scott: Non optimization single player tabletop games as like, you know, really that worthwhile of an experience.

692
00:57:40,361 --> 00:57:49,720
Scott: And it really not a very replayable experience very much compared to the other options for solo play that are out there.

693
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:50,041
Scott: Yeah.

694
00:57:50,101 --> 00:57:56,980
Rym: I mean, for me, honestly, the bar at this point would be something that pulls my brain in about the same level as Slay the Spire.

695
00:57:57,821 --> 00:57:57,962
Scott: Yeah.

696
00:57:58,505 --> 00:58:00,940
Scott: So, but that would be an optimization one.

697
00:58:02,922 --> 00:58:05,634
Scott: Um, so, but if you like them, you know, all right.

698
00:58:05,975 --> 00:58:06,959
Scott: Enjoy, I guess.

699
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,023
Scott: Yeah.

700
00:58:08,043 --> 00:58:09,368
Rym: I mean, there's nothing wrong with it.

701
00:58:09,408 --> 00:58:12,540
Rym: Just, they're not really our bag and, uh, I think they're going to be.

702
00:58:12,861 --> 00:58:15,190
Scott: But they become a huge thing lately.

703
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:17,580
Scott: So it's, I don't think we can like ignore them.

704
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:28,280
Scott: And I think even if I did mate, if I somehow miraculously made like some multiplayer board game, right, I might just give in and, you know, have two and one player versions.

705
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:34,860
Scott: However much I didn't like them just because it would get me sales and all I'd have to include was like a couple extra pages.

706
00:58:35,321 --> 00:58:42,818
Rym: See, that is why so many games will say three to five players, but you got to go to the BGG where some nerd will be like, it only works with four.

707
00:58:42,878 --> 00:58:43,259
Rym: Trust me.

708
00:58:45,806 --> 00:58:47,854
Rym: You play that with three or with five.

709
00:58:48,176 --> 00:58:49,140
Rym: Never play it with four.

710
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:53,930
Scott: I also see a lot of games that's like on the box will say three to five players.

711
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:58,140
Scott: They don't include solo or two player rules and some nerds go out and make some anyway.

712
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:03,914
Rym: I will say right now, I have read several of those proposed sets of rules.

713
00:59:03,934 --> 00:59:04,435
Scott: They are not great.

714
00:59:07,862 --> 00:59:12,140
Scott: But people are desperate, you know, in desperate times, desperate measures.

715
00:59:18,281 --> 00:59:20,527
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

716
00:59:20,567 --> 00:59:25,540
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

717
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:30,960
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

718
00:59:31,221 --> 00:59:33,908
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

719
00:59:34,049 --> 00:59:38,100
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

720
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,156
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

721
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:46,510
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

722
00:59:46,711 --> 00:59:49,580
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

723
00:59:49,921 --> 00:59:54,900
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights might be the last one for a hot minute.

724
00:59:56,441 --> 01:00:01,900
Rym: Alan Joyce, Linki G, Dread Lily, Tenebrae, a bunch of people who really don't want me to say their names.

725
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:08,397
Rym: Chris Hadar, Chris Reimer, Clinton Walton, Dex, Fink, Shaya85, Rebecca Dunn, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Horrell.

726
01:00:08,677 --> 01:00:09,640
Rym: Stop all the downloading.

727
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:15,380
Rym: The next station is Downsview Park, Downsview Park Station, and a bunch of people whose names I will not say at their request.

728
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:24,400
Rym: I will definitely pause the Patreon payment nonsense in September because we're gonna skip so many shows while I am traveling.

729
01:00:24,582 --> 01:00:26,419
Rym: And we are biking and all that nonsense is going on.

730
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:30,920
Rym: So if this is the last GeekNights episode you hear in a while, uh, yeah, we kind of phoned this one in.

731
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:37,780
Rym: We, uh, we haven't finished playing enough of these new games yet to have something big and new to review, but we're working on it.

732
01:00:38,321 --> 01:00:47,356
Rym: And, uh, we'll see you, I'll see maybe some of you at PAX West, and otherwise, I leave you with... "Daffy, what are you doing in an Albanian

733
01:00:47,396 --> 01:00:47,759
Rym: prison?".

734
01:00:47,941 --> 01:00:48,811
Rym: "What are you doing in the

735
01:00:48,851 --> 01:00:49,397
Rym: Marines?".

736
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:50,502
Rym: "I needed somewhere to

737
01:00:50,542 --> 01:00:50,682
Rym: go!".

738
01:00:55,411 --> 01:00:56,424
Rym: "I didn't kick you out of the

739
01:00:56,464 --> 01:00:56,748
Rym: house!".

740
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:00,517
Rym: "Then why did you tell Porky you were helping Lola

741
01:01:00,537 --> 01:01:00,618
Rym: Moon?".

742
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:05,148
Rym: "I just told him so I wouldn't have to go to the Peach

743
01:01:05,188 --> 01:01:05,430
Rym: Festival.".

744
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:07,838
Rym: *Gasp* "You lied?

745
01:01:08,382 --> 01:01:09,228
Rym: Who told you to

746
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:09,309
Rym: lie?".
