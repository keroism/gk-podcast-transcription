1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,068
Rym: It's Tuesday, April 17th, 2012.

2
00:00:12,068 --> 00:00:13,893
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,194 --> 00:00:14,715
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:16,480
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,339
Rym: Tonight, Mafia, or Werewolf, or Beantown, or whatever the fuck you call it.

6
00:00:26,201 --> 00:00:27,218
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,060
Scott: So, it is finally warm again.

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,328
Rym: Warmer yesterday.

9
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,100
Scott: It won't be warm forever.

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,029
Scott: It was warmer yesterday.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,516
Scott: We had a record high warmness in March.

12
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:44,920
Rym: I love New York City.

13
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:48,100
Scott: And there hasn't been a great number of April showers.

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,420
Rym: So Scott, one, we had a heatwave for a good chunk of summer last year.

15
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:53,640
Scott: I do not remember this heatwave.

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,379
Rym: I can't believe you don't remember the record setting heatwave that happened last year.

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,219
Scott: But, I'm beginning to think that it's possible that I...

18
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,919
Rym: You have Alzheimer's disease because you never remember anything?

19
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:09,959
Scott: I am feeling colder than other people because at work... Yesterday was much warmer than today.

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,060
Rym: Yeah, I got something to say about work and yesterday and much warmer, but we'll get to that.

21
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,199
Scott: One of my co-workers, you know, we discussed the weather, like you do.

22
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,627
Scott: He was like, "It's

23
00:01:19,848 --> 00:01:19,989
Scott: hot.".

24
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:22,540
Scott: And I'm like, "Eh, a little..." It's not hot.

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,074
Scott: And I was like, yesterday, I was like, "It's a little bit

26
00:01:25,114 --> 00:01:25,416
Scott: chilly.".

27
00:01:26,342 --> 00:01:26,893
Scott: To me, hot?

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,958
Scott: But to them, it was 80 degrees, but it was still a little bit chilly, even 80 degrees.

29
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:34,860
Rym: To me, hot means it's over about 88 degrees Fahrenheit.

30
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,977
Rym: Like, above that, it's...

31
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,960
Scott: Hot means I turn the air conditioner on, which is almost never.

32
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:40,510
Scott: Right?

33
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:47,500
Scott: I mean, this is why I don't remember there being a heatwave last year, because I used my air conditioner more two years ago when I first moved in...

34
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:48,580
Rym: Scott, it was like 98 degrees.

35
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,739
Scott: ...than I did last year.

36
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,959
Rym: Last year, on multiple days.

37
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,680
Scott: Last year, I used the air conditioner less than two years ago.

38
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:01,477
Rym: Scott, there was a weekend in August where there was an ozone warning, and I'm even the kind of person who's like, "Yeah, whatever, I'll go out in the stupid

39
00:02:01,517 --> 00:02:01,679
Rym: heat.".

40
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:05,020
Rym: And I go out and there's like 100 degree day biking with the ozone warning.

41
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:10,900
Rym: I made it maybe half a mile before I couldn't go anymore.

42
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,700
Scott: I biked every warm day last year, no matter how warm.

43
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,819
Rym: I don't think you biked that day.

44
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,899
Scott: I don't remember that specific day, but...

45
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,020
Rym: Well, Scott, you have latitude.

46
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:18,200
Rym: I have latitude.

47
00:02:18,684 --> 00:02:20,060
Rym: We can go see if you biked that day.

48
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,940
Scott: Did it log everything?

49
00:02:21,604 --> 00:02:22,459
Rym: Mine logs everything.

50
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:22,889
Scott: Anyway.

51
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,480
Scott: So, anyway, so I was biking in the warmness on Sunday.

52
00:02:28,222 --> 00:02:29,019
Scott: I think it was Sunday.

53
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,180
Scott: Or was it Saturday?

54
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,260
Scott: I don't remember anymore.

55
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,160
Scott: It was Sunday because I was still sickish on Saturday.

56
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:42,420
Scott: So, I went out to, instead of going to Manhattan like I usually do, or Brooklyn, I went to Flushing to the park because it's all awesome stuff over there.

57
00:02:42,904 --> 00:02:44,520
Rym: I biked over to Rockaway.

58
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:49,020
Rym: That's a really nice ride, and actually the beach is surprisingly pleasant.

59
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,959
Scott: Oh, far Rockaway.

60
00:02:50,281 --> 00:02:51,119
Rym: Yeah, way out there.

61
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,360
Rym: I didn't go over the causeway because it was already like 3 o'clock and I wanted to get home.

62
00:02:56,143 --> 00:03:11,499
Scott: So, I went to Flushing, and I was going behind the Hall of Science, you know, because I was going everywhere, and there's a dude, and I'm looking at this dude, and he looks like a nerdy dude, the kind of dude, you know, the middle-aged nerd, the kind of guy that's like, "He's got model trains in the basement, yo.

63
00:03:11,903 --> 00:03:12,295
Scott: You know he

64
00:03:12,316 --> 00:03:12,439
Scott: does.".

65
00:03:12,963 --> 00:03:13,069
Scott: Right?

66
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:20,660
Scott: So, I see this dude, and he's just standing there alone in this field behind the Hall of Science, nerdy place, and what is he doing?

67
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,459
Scott: He's flying a kite.

68
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,599
Scott: I can just tell, looking at him, he's flying a kite.

69
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:24,820
Rym: Kite nerd?

70
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:27,777
Scott: I'm looking, and I'm like, "Where the fuck is the

71
00:03:27,837 --> 00:03:28,098
Scott: kite?".

72
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:29,039
Rym: Mile up.

73
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,780
Scott: You can tell that he's holding a kite, just by the way he's standing.

74
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:34,520
Scott: I'm looking for the kite.

75
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,920
Rym: Scott, there's a prank.

76
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,260
Scott: The kite is a fucking dot.

77
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,534
Scott: It is so far away, right?

78
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:48,736
Scott: It is unbelievably far away, just a regular old triangle, you know, diamond style, and I'm like, "Holy

79
00:03:48,817 --> 00:03:49,040
Scott: shit.".

80
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,158
Scott: So, I'm like, "Well, this guy could be a nerdy, scary guy, you know, that

81
00:03:53,198 --> 00:03:53,500
Scott: kind.".

82
00:03:53,661 --> 00:03:54,853
Scott: But, I'm like, "Well, I'll talk to this

83
00:03:54,873 --> 00:03:55,095
Scott: guy.".

84
00:03:55,681 --> 00:03:56,411
Scott: So, I was like, "Hey, kite

85
00:03:56,432 --> 00:03:56,695
Scott: dude.".

86
00:03:57,263 --> 00:03:58,256
Scott: And he's like, "Hey, what's going

87
00:03:58,398 --> 00:03:58,439
Scott: on?".

88
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,440
Scott: So, apparently, this dude, I got lucky.

89
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,499
Scott: He was not scary.

90
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:03,179
Scott: He was double awesome.

91
00:04:03,782 --> 00:04:03,893
Scott: Right?

92
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,060
Scott: Maybe even triple awesome.

93
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:15,540
Scott: So, not only was he a bikin' dude, and a kitin' dude, he was also the guy who does... His job is the exhibit-making dude at the Hall of Science.

94
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,319
Scott: Really?

95
00:04:16,688 --> 00:04:16,817
Scott: Yeah.

96
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,579
Scott: So, he makes the exhibits at the Hall of Science.

97
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,079
Scott: He bikes... He lives to the east, right?

98
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,640
Scott: So, somewhere Long Island-ish.

99
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:25,338
Scott: He bikes to the Hall of Science every day.

100
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,800
Scott: And, I guess, awesome at flying kites, and I guess general science and nerdiness.

101
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,276
Scott: Not bad.

102
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,720
Scott: And he was not scary, or weird, or socially inept in any way.

103
00:04:35,662 --> 00:04:37,860
Scott: And he was point... He was like... I was, like, askin' him about kites.

104
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,040
Scott: He's like, "Yeah, if there's crazy wind...".

105
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,400
Scott: And he was pointing at the flag on the tennis stadium.

106
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:42,758
Rym: Yeah.

107
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:43,280
Scott: Right?

108
00:04:43,401 --> 00:04:44,619
Scott: To figure out what the wind was.

109
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,660
Scott: And I was like, "Oh my..." Right?

110
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,336
Scott: So, he's like, "If that flag is straight out, you need, like, a box

111
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:48,598
Scott: kite.".

112
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,160
Scott: But, see, the flag is only kinda half flappin' today, so you use this regular kite.

113
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,900
Scott: And he made the kite himself with the bamboo and whatever.

114
00:04:56,442 --> 00:04:56,760
Scott: And, you know.

115
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,528
Scott: So, I was like,

116
00:04:57,671 --> 00:04:57,711
Scott: "Ah.".

117
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,520
Scott: So, Nerdfind.

118
00:05:00,482 --> 00:05:01,459
Rym: Speaking of Nerdfind.

119
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:04,959
Rym: So, I did not follow up with this dude.

120
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,359
Rym: But, you know, I was on the Amtrak Acela from Boston from PAX.

121
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:11,199
Scott: Oh, the one that did not make it?

122
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,677
Rym: The one that did not make it.

123
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,560
Rym: I'll do a separate show.

124
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,699
Rym: Maybe that'll be the Thursday show.

125
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,479
Rym: What the fuck, Amtrak?

126
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:16,750
Scott: Amtrak.

127
00:05:17,642 --> 00:05:18,520
Rym: Seriously, Amtrak.

128
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,260
Rym: I've ridden Amtrak trains five times in my life.

129
00:05:21,381 --> 00:05:23,880
Rym: Only once have I not had serious incidents.

130
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,440
Scott: I think the best experience I had in an Amtrak train was we took the auto train.

131
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,640
Scott: Which is, you had to go to Virginia.

132
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:31,960
Scott: And it only goes from Virginia to Florida.

133
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,314
Scott: That's it.

134
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,780
Scott: That I know of, right?

135
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,859
Scott: And you put your car on the train.

136
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:37,659
Scott: And then you get on the train.

137
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:39,940
Scott: And then it takes you to Florida or vice versa.

138
00:05:40,081 --> 00:05:41,020
Scott: And then your car gets off.

139
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,440
Scott: So, you don't need to rent a car on the other end.

140
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,740
Rym: I took it to Albany once and it was late, but not that late.

141
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,259
Scott: And it was, you know, it took a while.

142
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,020
Scott: 'Cause it's, like, it's an overnight train.

143
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,599
Scott: I mean, you get on the train, you go to bed, you wake up.

144
00:05:50,761 --> 00:05:52,080
Scott: And then, you know, you're in Florida.

145
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:52,958
Scott: And vice versa.

146
00:05:53,664 --> 00:05:54,079
Scott: But it worked.

147
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:54,959
Scott: It didn't have any problems.

148
00:05:55,682 --> 00:05:58,660
Scott: And you got food on it, which was the equivalent of airline food.

149
00:05:59,222 --> 00:06:00,619
Scott: And it had a dining car you could go in.

150
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,460
Rym: But anyway, to get past the shit no one cares about, and back to mine.

151
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,280
Rym: So, when the train, you know, disaster happened.

152
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,720
Rym: I'm standing on this platform in, like, Bridgeport.

153
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,839
Rym: Like, that's where I ended up.

154
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:13,340
Rym: And I'm trying to get home.

155
00:06:13,921 --> 00:06:16,960
Rym: There's this guy who keeps announcing, like, where trains are.

156
00:06:17,262 --> 00:06:18,499
Rym: And which trains are going by.

157
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:19,600
Rym: Like, a train starts coming.

158
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,940
Rym: And at one point, I was like, I swear to God, if that's the Amtrak, I got off.

159
00:06:24,562 --> 00:06:25,600
Rym: And it goes past the station.

160
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,399
Rym: I'm throwing a motherfucking rock at it.

161
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:29,440
Rym: And he's like, no, no, no, look at the lights.

162
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,120
Rym: That's not an Amtrak.

163
00:06:30,821 --> 00:06:32,519
Rym: And he tells me this, like, train model number.

164
00:06:33,401 --> 00:06:35,658
Rym: And then I realize, like, I look at this guy and he's kind of scruffy.

165
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,379
Rym: But he's wearing, like, an orange vest.

166
00:06:37,741 --> 00:06:42,480
Rym: And he's got a walkie-talkie that has MTA and Amtrak people saying stuff.

167
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:49,379
Rym: He was totally a trainspotting nerd who came out in all the excitement to see what was going on.

168
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,020
Scott: Yeah, he was probably sitting at home listening to the train radio.

169
00:06:53,161 --> 00:06:53,697
Rym: I can just imagine.

170
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,880
Scott: Heard that something happened.

171
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,699
Scott: And he's like, oh, man, action on the trail.

172
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,840
Rym: Yeah, so this was, like, his night to shine.

173
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,438
Rym: And you know what?

174
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,920
Rym: Crazy train guy, you were crazy.

175
00:07:04,661 --> 00:07:10,000
Rym: But you knew more about what was going on than any Amtrak or MTA employee I ran into that entire evening.

176
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,620
Scott: Because he ran, he was talking to the ones that were on the walkie-talkie, which are the ones that know something.

177
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,559
Rym: No, they didn't know shit.

178
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,680
Scott: The ones that, well, then how did he know if the walkie-talkie wasn't telling him?

179
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,458
Rym: You know how he knew?

180
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:26,880
Rym: Because he had this crazy timetable, and I don't know where he got it from, and he could recognize trains.

181
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:36,620
Rym: So when one train went by, and depending on what track and what direction it was going, he identified it on this timetable, and then he figured out where all the other trains were based on that.

182
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,286
Scott: Whoa.

183
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:40,277
Rym: Yeah, this guy was quite a guy.

184
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:41,818
Scott: Quite a guy.

185
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,400
Scott: But he was crazy.

186
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,980
Scott: Not like my guy who was totally chill.

187
00:07:44,942 --> 00:07:48,240
Rym: He was crazy, but in that, like, engineer gnome kind of way.

188
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,646
Rym: Like, cool nerd, but... But.

189
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,500
Scott: Yeah, the guy I found was just kind of an awesome guy all around.

190
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:55,400
Rym: But anyway.

191
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:04,460
Scott: The thing is, how come I can never, like, find, you know, some cute 20-something girl flying a kite a mile in the air who also makes exhibits at the Hall of Science?

192
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,180
Rym: They're out there.

193
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:06,177
Scott: And is standing there.

194
00:08:07,003 --> 00:08:07,880
Scott: But I don't see them.

195
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,516
Scott: I haven't found them.

196
00:08:09,181 --> 00:08:09,600
Rym: Keep biking.

197
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,858
Rym: But, uh, yeah, PAX.

198
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:12,917
Rym: PAX from PAX.

199
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,160
Rym: PAX East 2012.

200
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,920
Rym: It was, uh, I don't want to say it was the best PAX ever, but it was the best PAX East ever.

201
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:21,037
Rym: For me.

202
00:08:21,341 --> 00:08:22,039
Rym: I had the best time.

203
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,677
Rym: You got sick.

204
00:08:23,124 --> 00:08:23,720
Scott: I did get sick.

205
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,800
Rym: Which colors your experience.

206
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,680
Scott: It does indeed color my personal experience.

207
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,460
Scott: But looking at the PAX itself, you know, trying to judge it as a PAX East.

208
00:08:33,187 --> 00:08:33,840
Scott: It was pretty good.

209
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:36,217
Scott: I guess it was better than the previous PAX Easts.

210
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,999
Scott: I think I must agree.

211
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,919
Rym: There have only been, how many PAX Easts, Scott?

212
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,960
Scott: There's only the third one.

213
00:08:41,741 --> 00:08:42,600
Rym: And, let's see.

214
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,179
Rym: If we judge them based on keynotes.

215
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,740
Rym: Uh, well, Jaffe was, well, that was prime.

216
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,280
Scott: That's not prime.

217
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:48,840
Scott: That's not East.

218
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,720
Scott: The three Easts are Wheaton, McGonagall, and, uh, Jordan, Meckner.

219
00:08:54,003 --> 00:08:54,090
Rym: Yeah.

220
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,380
Rym: Uh, McGonagall still pretty much wins that, uh, tournament.

221
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,046
Scott: Yeah.

222
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,980
Scott: I think, I think actually, like, Meckner's material better.

223
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:04,380
Scott: Maybe because I, but I think that's only because I knew McGonagall's material already.

224
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:11,000
Scott: And, because, but Meckner's delivery was not as great because he was all, he was all nervous.

225
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,036
Rym: McGonagall has a sort of, like, I am almost giving a TED Talk demeanor.

226
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:15,960
Rym: that really draws you in.

227
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,440
Rym: Even though you already know what she's going to say.

228
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,480
Scott: She had experience giving a TED Talk.

229
00:09:20,503 --> 00:09:21,698
Scott: That might have something to do with it.

230
00:09:22,522 --> 00:09:25,520
Rym: It was weird that Meckner opened it up to questions.

231
00:09:26,002 --> 00:09:26,999
Scott: That was very weird, yes.

232
00:09:27,361 --> 00:09:28,820
Scott: I think that also gets some minus points.

233
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:35,120
Rym: But, I was surprised that less than 80% of the questions were awful.

234
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:35,720
Rym: That's true.

235
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,859
Rym: Some of them were awful.

236
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,080
Rym: But the percentage was way better than I would have ever hazarded a guess.

237
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:48,460
Rym: And I think it's only because people were too intimidated to ask the really stupid questions.

238
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,720
Scott: At the keynote, right?

239
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:49,908
Scott: Yeah.

240
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,100
Scott: Like, it's easy to ask a question at some panel.

241
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,480
Scott: It's not easy to ask a question at the keynote.

242
00:09:55,102 --> 00:10:00,000
Rym: But it was the best PAX East that I personally have attended from my own personal experience.

243
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:08,120
Rym: Because one, by not doing three panels at the PAX, I had a lot more time to just dick around and play games.

244
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:08,902
Scott: I think that's another thing.

245
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:14,800
Scott: is that even getting, also, having to go to Anime Boston definitely hurt the personal experience.

246
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,760
Rym: I think it only hurt you because that was at your sort of, like, you were approaching peak sickness.

247
00:10:20,145 --> 00:10:20,233
Rym: Yeah.

248
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,780
Rym: Because after that, you didn't come out and game with us.

249
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,338
Rym: You went to bed.

250
00:10:23,992 --> 00:10:24,380
Scott: I did indeed.

251
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,060
Rym: And after that, we kept gaming until, like, three in the morning.

252
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,240
Rym: Yep.

253
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,459
Rym: So, basically, everyone, like, reconverged from dinner and we played games all night long in the Westin.

254
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,200
Rym: But, let's see, highlights.

255
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,960
Rym: You know, we're not going to do a whole show dedicated to PAX.

256
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,700
Scott: Because if you listen to- You're going to say the same things we've always said.

257
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,980
Rym: Yeah, there's no reason for us to say, you know, go to this, go to that, you know all that stuff.

258
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,999
Rym: So, what was different about this PAX?

259
00:10:50,302 --> 00:10:53,080
Rym: One, I feel like we're kind of dumb.

260
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:56,640
Rym: Because we did that PSA, you know, we planned all ahead of time.

261
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:02,460
Rym: We knew, we figured out the easiest way to catch an existing PAX counterfeit badge.

262
00:11:02,964 --> 00:11:04,420
Rym: And we had a picture of the new badge.

263
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,206
Rym: So, we knew that.

264
00:11:06,327 --> 00:11:09,100
Rym: also, you know, there's two holograms, one embedded, one a sticker.

265
00:11:09,221 --> 00:11:12,800
Rym: So, we made a pretty good PSA on the best way to catch a counterfeit badge.

266
00:11:14,064 --> 00:11:15,500
Rym: I did not think of UV paint.

267
00:11:16,362 --> 00:11:19,340
Rym: I did not think of a UV watermark.

268
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,450
Rym: I can't believe I didn't think of that.

269
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:22,720
Scott: It's so obvious in retrospect.

270
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,940
Scott: Well, the thing with the UV thing is I had thought of it, but I was like, well, that's usually something that you put in a stamp on someone's hand.

271
00:11:29,442 --> 00:11:31,580
Scott: You know, it's like, how do you get it into a plastic thing?

272
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:33,080
Scott: But I guess we have that technology.

273
00:11:33,623 --> 00:11:34,960
Scott: And how do you check them in bulk?

274
00:11:35,081 --> 00:11:36,411
Scott: It's like, you have to check them one at a time.

275
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:37,540
Scott: It's like, where are they going to check them?

276
00:11:37,821 --> 00:11:43,080
Rym: So, it was shown to me early on, like on Thursday, I was like, yeah, we made that PSA, check it out, you can just rip it in half.

277
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,800
Rym: And then an unnamed enforcer was like, yeah, we had a better way.

278
00:11:47,301 --> 00:11:54,940
Rym: And this person pulls out a little pen that's a UV light and is like, and I see the logo, you know, the extra bits on my badge.

279
00:11:55,261 --> 00:11:57,860
Scott: Yeah, and basically the badges had this little strip.

280
00:11:58,081 --> 00:12:02,260
Scott: And if they came in, if there was UV light, these little space invaders would start glowing.

281
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:04,080
Scott: Now, the thing is, they were really cool looking.

282
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,180
Rym: Immediately, I thought, all right, so they'll do this at choke points because the peep, the kinds of people.

283
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,900
Scott: Yeah, but they didn't check them going into like the keynote or anything.

284
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,159
Rym: They did check them going into the expo hall.

285
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,380
Scott: But they only checked them at certain expo hall entrances.

286
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,478
Scott: If you went to the back of the expo hall, you could just walk right in.

287
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:24,100
Rym: Exactly, but think about the kinds of people who get the counterfeit badges or something like this.

288
00:12:24,441 --> 00:12:26,480
Rym: They are expo hall primetime people.

289
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:39,159
Scott: And the other thing they did that was very clever, right, is that instead of like stopping everyone and looking at each and every single badge, they just had this sort of like, if you walked into the doorway, in front of the doorway is like the structure that all these UV lights come in on.

290
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,539
Rym: Ah, so that was my second revelation.

291
00:12:40,721 --> 00:12:44,120
Scott: You sort of felt like you were walking through an outer space airlock thing.

292
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:50,080
Scott: But really, there was someone looking at every badge in that, you know, of anyone standing in that spot.

293
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:56,040
Rym: I stood there for a while with some enforcers and some security were checking badges and no counterfeits came through.

294
00:12:56,381 --> 00:12:59,540
Rym: But you could see it was obvious had there been a counterfeit.

295
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,940
Scott: You could just at a quick glance, just look at a whole bunch of badges and see Space Invaders and all of them.

296
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,945
Rym: So I didn't notice those.

297
00:13:04,045 --> 00:13:07,360
Rym: So it was, I think, Friday night, I was staggering back from something.

298
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:12,560
Rym: Like I went out to the hotel room, I'm on my way back and I walked by that thing and I'm like, why is that black?

299
00:13:13,142 --> 00:13:14,150
Rym: Oh, I'm stupid.

300
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:15,380
Rym: Duh.

301
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,320
Scott: So, you know, it's like you can try if you're a counterfeiter to do this.

302
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:25,140
Scott: But it's like, how are you going to figure out what pattern to do before the convention?

303
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:38,240
Scott: So you have to get a real badge right for, you know, to actually buy one because you're not going to find a picture of the thing online with a blacklight, you know, and then you've got to like manufacture the badges with that exact thing in the exact right place.

304
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,100
Scott: That's not going to be easy to do in a short amount of time.

305
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:48,540
Rym: And the thing is, even if they get all that right, our terror test still works because no one's going to make a plastic badge.

306
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,580
Scott: And even if you put all the money into manufacturing it correctly, that's going to eat into all your profits.

307
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:53,981
Scott: Yeah.

308
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,059
Scott: You're not going to make that much money selling the badges.

309
00:13:56,562 --> 00:13:58,690
Rym: So they pretty much.

310
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,140
Rym: So, you know, I think our PSA said it best.

311
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,998
Rym: Guys who run non-Paxus, there's really no excuse not to mail your motherfucking badges.

312
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:06,420
Scott: Jesus.

313
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,258
Scott: That's right.

314
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:17,200
Rym: But, yeah, I mean, the counterfeit thing, a highly placed source tells me that they cost less than 10 at the entire con.

315
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,240
Scott: Yeah, I did not hear about any major counterfeiting problems.

316
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,128
Rym: Less than 10.

317
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:22,380
Rym: I did not personally see any.

318
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:30,920
Rym: And the confidence level is high that 99 plus percent of the counterfeit badges that existed were caught trivially.

319
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:33,483
Rym: Whatever.

320
00:14:33,663 --> 00:14:35,672
Rym: Pax sold out except for Sunday badges.

321
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:37,360
Rym: I'm pretty sure they did not sell out of Sunday.

322
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,987
Scott: Because it's Easter and there was a lot.

323
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:41,760
Scott: I think a lot of people bought Friday, Saturday, but not Sunday.

324
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,680
Rym: Well, the thing is, here's what I think happened.

325
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:51,560
Rym: And I still every year, you know, I tell the people I know at Pax that in my estimation, they should not bother selling single day badges.

326
00:14:52,440 --> 00:15:02,760
Rym: Because the majority of the people, in my opinion, my guests who buy single day badges, buy Friday, Saturday, Sunday because they couldn't get a three day badge.

327
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:09,119
Scott: I think there are also there's another group of people that buys Saturday or Friday and they just come for the one day and that's it.

328
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:10,800
Rym: But I think they're a minority.

329
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:19,700
Scott: And I did see a lot of people wearing single day badges who did not also have other badges attached at the time.

330
00:15:20,242 --> 00:15:22,679
Scott: But they may have had the other badges in their room.

331
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,417
Rym: So I talked to some of those people when I saw single day badges.

332
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:27,960
Rym: I was like, hey.

333
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:32,940
Scott: And I did see, though, of course, also quite a few people who had all three single day badges.

334
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,551
Rym: So I have another supposition based on the people.

335
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:36,958
Rym: I talked to one anecdote.

336
00:15:37,661 --> 00:15:46,480
Rym: I'm pretty sure a lot of the people who had single day badges, since it was expensive to buy all three, just got one or two.

337
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,808
Rym: They'd rather have come for all three days.

338
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:51,540
Rym: But since they couldn't come for all three, they got just one day.

339
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,740
Rym: A lot of people were like, yeah, I couldn't get a three day, so I just got a Saturday.

340
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,199
Rym: I think they should just get rid of the single day badges.

341
00:15:58,562 --> 00:15:59,474
Scott: I've thought that for a while.

342
00:15:59,494 --> 00:15:59,919
Scott: It's not news.

343
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:00,441
Rym: Yeah.

344
00:16:00,521 --> 00:16:01,607
Rym: I mean, Otakon got rid of them.

345
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,260
Rym: One of the few smart things they've done in recent memory.

346
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:06,905
Rym: The keynote was pretty good.

347
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:09,917
Rym: I don't really want to play death bounce.

348
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:10,760
Rym: Seriously.

349
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,731
Scott: I play death bounce.

350
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:12,180
Scott: It sucks.

351
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,630
Rym: Jordan, you don't have to.

352
00:16:13,811 --> 00:16:14,759
Rym: You didn't have to do that.

353
00:16:14,921 --> 00:16:15,405
Scott: It's already online.

354
00:16:15,445 --> 00:16:15,748
Scott: It sucks.

355
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:17,260
Scott: Some guy found a meeting.

356
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:23,920
Rym: But it did prove the Eric Cartman principle that all you have to do is say something that exists is not available.

357
00:16:24,821 --> 00:16:29,480
Rym: And people suddenly will not only want it, but launch a campaign to get it and to give you money for it.

358
00:16:31,144 --> 00:16:34,500
Scott: While death bounce is like, OK, so whatever.

359
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,651
Rym: Scott, I'm going to quote someone.

360
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:37,480
Rym: You should know who I'm quoting.

361
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,839
Rym: There should be any museum.

362
00:16:39,761 --> 00:16:49,520
Scott: The thing is, it's like no matter whether something's good or bad, it could be a stick figure that has any significance whatsoever.

363
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:56,980
Scott: It's people we can't stand to have information, especially art, not available and out there.

364
00:16:57,441 --> 00:16:57,902
Scott: You know, it's like.

365
00:16:57,923 --> 00:16:58,986
Scott: it doesn't matter what it is.

366
00:16:59,246 --> 00:17:03,820
Scott: We need to preserve all of humanity because we have learned this.

367
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,300
Scott: You know, humanity has a lot of lessons that we failed to learn.

368
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:11,819
Rym: You know, one is failing to learn lessons, of course.

369
00:17:12,424 --> 00:17:13,940
Scott: But there is a lesson that we have.

370
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,920
Scott: You know, people often forget the lessons we have successfully learned and have not forgotten.

371
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,060
Scott: And then the first lesson was the Library of Alexandria.

372
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,103
Scott: Right.

373
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:26,800
Scott: It's someone's going to burn it down.

374
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,350
Scott: So everyone keep one in your house.

375
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,519
Scott: That way they can't burn all the houses down.

376
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:32,964
Scott: Right.

377
00:17:33,004 --> 00:17:34,979
Scott: And this is something we've done a very good job of.

378
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,301
Scott: Yep.

379
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:37,380
Rym: I mean, look at how many people still want.

380
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,402
Rym: And they're out there.

381
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:45,341
Rym: The the beta episodes of GeekNights from like September 2005.

382
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:45,522
Rym: Yeah.

383
00:17:45,683 --> 00:17:48,500
Scott: And earlier, you know, in learning that lesson, they're out there.

384
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:49,551
Scott: They're out there.

385
00:17:49,572 --> 00:17:50,140
Scott: They're available.

386
00:17:50,323 --> 00:17:51,098
Rym: Yeah, you can get them.

387
00:17:53,283 --> 00:17:54,635
Scott: I checked rather recently.

388
00:17:54,676 --> 00:17:55,099
Scott: They're there.

389
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:58,300
Rym: I listened to the first one that's up.

390
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,400
Rym: I think I might have a couple from before then on my hard drive, but we never published those ever.

391
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,139
Rym: Maybe I'll put one of those.

392
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:05,502
Scott: Yeah.

393
00:18:05,522 --> 00:18:05,970
Scott: Put them up there.

394
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:06,539
Scott: Like, come on.

395
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:06,882
Rym: I should.

396
00:18:06,902 --> 00:18:08,032
Rym: I got to dig them up.

397
00:18:08,193 --> 00:18:08,960
Rym: They're on a hard drive.

398
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,260
Scott: That's GeekNights Death Bounds.

399
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:10,763
Scott: Yeah.

400
00:18:10,783 --> 00:18:11,879
Rym: They're on a hard drive over there.

401
00:18:13,161 --> 00:18:14,479
Rym: But yeah, they're pretty horrible.

402
00:18:15,584 --> 00:18:16,554
Scott: Just like Death Bounds.

403
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,060
Scott: Real horrible.

404
00:18:17,473 --> 00:18:17,639
Rym: Yep.

405
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,759
Rym: But all in all, his talk was great.

406
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:32,980
Rym: And in the sense that I really like to hear more about, you know, these sort of details of like how these people made their way through the gaming industry who are technical and know how to make games or aren't just like producer types.

407
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:39,500
Scott: Well, the one thing, you know, it's like he pretty much had a very similar story to many other game developers and entrepreneurial people.

408
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,980
Rym: When money came up, he was he basically, without saying it, said, yeah, I'm super rich.

409
00:18:44,121 --> 00:18:45,080
Rym: I don't have to worry.

410
00:18:45,281 --> 00:18:45,624
Scott: Right.

411
00:18:45,664 --> 00:18:47,620
Scott: But at the same time, right.

412
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,400
Scott: He also admitted something that a lot of these intrapreneur, you know, startup you guys don't.

413
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,780
Rym: That he fucked up and lost all his money.

414
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,080
Scott: Right.

415
00:18:54,100 --> 00:19:02,620
Scott: Which is that he you know, he he did risk it all multiple times and he was ass ass broke, almost homeless, zero dollars broke.

416
00:19:03,064 --> 00:19:03,227
Rym: Yeah.

417
00:19:03,247 --> 00:19:04,060
Rym: Look at how many times.

418
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,882
Scott: Once or twice.

419
00:19:05,203 --> 00:19:09,740
Scott: And that's the reason I don't do that shit, because I am not going to eat ramen and live on the street.

420
00:19:10,221 --> 00:19:13,960
Rym: Look at how many times he gave up on games and did something else.

421
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,400
Scott: There is no guarantee that you will end up rich later like he did.

422
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,560
Scott: You know, a lot of people who go for it just end up broke.

423
00:19:20,722 --> 00:19:21,328
Scott: And that's it.

424
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:22,540
Scott: End of story.

425
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:22,980
Rym: Yep.

426
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:29,740
Rym: But most of the successful entrepreneurs I know have lost millions on previous ventures along the way.

427
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,162
Scott: Yeah.

428
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,488
Scott: But those are the people who are.

429
00:19:31,508 --> 00:19:34,080
Scott: they're not risking at all because they already have millions from something.

430
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,003
Scott: I would risk.

431
00:19:35,103 --> 00:19:39,660
Scott: I'm talking about the people who have who don't who have normal money or even less than normal money.

432
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,062
Scott: Yeah.

433
00:19:40,343 --> 00:19:42,877
Scott: And then they go and try to start something and then they're broke.

434
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:43,400
Scott: and then what?

435
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,360
Rym: But I point out there's a lot of those people who spent his million on that.

436
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,673
Rym: Like it wasn't like he had no idea and he went for it.

437
00:19:49,693 --> 00:19:50,940
Rym: He had million and went for it.

438
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,305
Scott: But he spent the whole million.

439
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:52,566
Rym: Yeah.

440
00:19:52,587 --> 00:19:55,820
Scott: Well, you're talking about the people of multimillion who spend a million.

441
00:19:56,001 --> 00:19:57,679
Scott: He had the one million and he spent the whole thing.

442
00:19:58,042 --> 00:20:00,359
Rym: I would spend my whole million, but it'd have to be on the right thing.

443
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,440
Rym: If I had the whole million tribes to to that whole million is a million wouldn't buy a tribes to two.

444
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,479
Scott: I'm just saying my whole million, if I had one, would be in the guarantee that I could go to the tropical island million.

445
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:12,806
Scott: And I would not spend it.

446
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,420
Scott: I would need more than one million.

447
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:23,960
Scott: You know, once the once the tropical island is guaranteed and locked in, then the rest would go to charities and risky things and all that sort of stuff.

448
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:29,700
Scott: But up until I've got that beach locked in place, it's not going anywhere.

449
00:20:30,161 --> 00:20:32,129
Rym: So the expo hall was an expo hall.

450
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,920
Rym: They made it bigger by cutting into the wasted space.

451
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,281
Rym: Yeah.

452
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:41,800
Scott: And the thing is, while they made it bigger in square footage wise, it seemed like there were fewer larger booths.

453
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,980
Scott: There were a lot of really big booths that took up a fuck ton of space.

454
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,380
Scott: I think my the and I ignored the big ones and only check the small ones.

455
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:54,040
Rym: Some of the highlights of the expo hall was, I guess, spider goddess vagina.

456
00:20:55,701 --> 00:21:00,500
Scott: I think that's the kind of stuff that took up way too much room like that borderlands to how much it was telling.

457
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,200
Scott: How much space did they use on like giant statues?

458
00:21:03,601 --> 00:21:09,260
Rym: Then I walked in and I see that there and I'm thinking to myself, great, it's Lolth's vagina.

459
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:09,802
Scott: Right.

460
00:21:09,822 --> 00:21:11,478
Scott: And of course, Rym knows all about this.

461
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,774
Rym: Yeah, Scott's like...

462
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,779
Scott: Rym's the expert.

463
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:17,293
Scott: Yeah, it's like a giant spider statue.

464
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:18,780
Scott: And I'm like, what is this?

465
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,838
Scott: And Rym's like, well, let me tell you all about the realm, the lore of forgotten realms.

466
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,207
Scott: I happen to be a hundred percent expert.

467
00:21:25,227 --> 00:21:28,240
Scott: You knew as much about that spider as that dude knew about kites.

468
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:28,781
Rym: I know.

469
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:32,340
Rym: The scary thing is I haven't played D&D in like seven or eight years.

470
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:33,559
Scott: And it's still the same shit.

471
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,299
Scott: Some stuff has changed.

472
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,175
Scott: Rym's seven year old D&D knowledge is still 99% accurate.

473
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,920
Scott: That shows you how creative those wasi people are.

474
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,944
Rym: Some things have changed.

475
00:21:43,004 --> 00:21:46,480
Rym: I heard that there was some disaster that befell Evaresca, which kind of pisses me off.

476
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,397
Rym: But you know it.

477
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,299
Scott: So your knowledge is still up to date.

478
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,840
Rym: And I think the shadow kingdom rose in the north.

479
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,959
Scott: Right, look at how much Rym knows about this bullshit.

480
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,839
Rym: Out of the old Netherese ruins.

481
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,109
Scott: Some lich or something.

482
00:22:00,684 --> 00:22:03,560
Scott: Why do we play a game in this universe you're so knowledgeable of?

483
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,245
Rym: You know what, we should.

484
00:22:04,265 --> 00:22:06,040
Rym: We should play a Burning Wheel game in that universe.

485
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,580
Scott: Burning Realms or Forgotten Wheel?

486
00:22:07,941 --> 00:22:09,538
Rym: That's what, uh...

487
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:11,079
Scott: I'd like Forgotten Wheel.

488
00:22:11,944 --> 00:22:12,860
Rym: I guess the other highlight is...

489
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,041
Scott: No, wait.

490
00:22:13,344 --> 00:22:14,331
Scott: For-gah-ten Wheel.

491
00:22:14,372 --> 00:22:15,420
Scott: I pronounced it improperly.

492
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,198
Rym: For-gah-ten.

493
00:22:16,822 --> 00:22:17,280
Scott: That's right.

494
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,500
Rym: So Geek Chic was there, but I think they had a funny bit.

495
00:22:19,621 --> 00:22:19,919
Rym: Boba Fett.

496
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,419
Rym: And I got one because it was worth it.

497
00:22:22,847 --> 00:22:24,760
Rym: They were monocles, like a thing on a chain.

498
00:22:24,962 --> 00:22:26,140
Rym: But it was a monocle mustache.

499
00:22:27,302 --> 00:22:31,260
Scott: That was a good deal on them because they sort of realized, hey, we're selling these fancy tables.

500
00:22:31,743 --> 00:22:33,420
Scott: We get a lot of attention at the conventions.

501
00:22:33,981 --> 00:22:38,800
Scott: But we're not making any money because only very few people are going to shell out thousands of dollars for a table.

502
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,040
Rym: And they can't manufacture them that quickly, so I think they already have a backlog.

503
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,140
Scott: Yeah, it's like if you try to order one of those tables, you're in line, basically.

504
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,060
Scott: And you might get your table like a year from now.

505
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,740
Scott: So, you know, not a lot of people, even people with the money, some people don't sign up because they're impatient.

506
00:22:52,222 --> 00:22:52,625
Rym: The answer?

507
00:22:52,645 --> 00:22:54,620
Rym: Sell stuff that nerds care about.

508
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,480
Rym: They got wooden axes, wooden swords, monocle mustaches.

509
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:08,280
Scott: Come up with something else you can sell for a lower price that, you know, all those people who come up to your booth because it's so attractive will spend money on.

510
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:18,200
Rym: I was a little annoyed that there were a lot of the more indie people this year, more so than other years, at least in my perception, were trying that hard sell bullshit on me.

511
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:18,724
Scott: Really?

512
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:19,220
Scott: I didn't notice that.

513
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:24,940
Rym: I'd be walking by and they'd be like really trying to like make me come and play their game that I already didn't care about.

514
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:32,880
Scott: I think part of that was that a lot of the, like, a good portion of the indie type booths, it used to be like, hey, check out my indie game.

515
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:43,660
Scott: Now it was more like, you know, even though they were a small booth, right, and they were sort of, okay, they look like an indie, it was really some guy trying to sell his iPhone game, you know?

516
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,896
Scott: And it's sort of like he's less indie than full indie.

517
00:23:48,187 --> 00:23:48,995
Rym: Well, what is indie?

518
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,860
Scott: There's no definition.

519
00:23:51,860 --> 00:24:05,017
Scott: But, you know, I'm just saying, you know, regardless of what word you use to label it, there's a difference between that guy who made a game in his basement and he saved up to buy a PAX booth and is sharing it with two other people, you know, or something

520
00:24:05,157 --> 00:24:06,439
Rym: like, you know, Spy Party.

521
00:24:07,721 --> 00:24:09,338
Rym: I'm going to say something a little simpler.

522
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:17,160
Rym: Monaco impressed me more than any similarly placed game I saw in the Xbox.

523
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,440
Scott: Monaco, I got to point something out about Monaco, right?

524
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,960
Scott: So we interviewed that guy in the show and that game has been coming out for years.

525
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:24,840
Rym: I would have bought it as it was back then.

526
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,459
Scott: It won like some IGDA award, like a long time ago, right?

527
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,319
Rym: Dude, I would give you 50 bucks for what it was a year ago.

528
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:38,460
Scott: So it feels like this game has been taking forever to come out, but the reality is that it actually, you know, the guy tweeted about this.

529
00:24:38,621 --> 00:24:40,619
Scott: He's only been working on it for like two, three years.

530
00:24:41,341 --> 00:24:43,220
Scott: And the fact is most games take longer than that.

531
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:43,407
Scott: Yeah.

532
00:24:44,101 --> 00:24:48,600
Scott: And it's the only reason it feels so long is because he's been so public.

533
00:24:48,701 --> 00:24:51,560
Scott: He's had the game out there in like its earliest, earliest version.

534
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,520
Rym: Yeah, I remember we were talking to him and he was like, yeah, it wasn't that long ago.

535
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,640
Rym: The game was great.

536
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:56,657
Rym: Step, step, step.

537
00:24:57,107 --> 00:24:57,240
Rym: Yeah.

538
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,040
Scott: Imagine if Nintendo showed you like what they were working on all the time.

539
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:06,035
Scott: We would be looking at a game now that wasn't going to come out for like five or six years.

540
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:10,640
Scott: that was meant for the Wii U. But it would feel like when is this thing coming out?

541
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,219
Scott: That's why they don't announce it for so long.

542
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:19,380
Scott: My point is simply that to finish the point, Monaco has changed drastically over this amount of time.

543
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,460
Scott: He's been working on it consistently.

544
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,500
Scott: It's not some vaporware.

545
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:22,940
Scott: It's right.

546
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:23,800
Scott: There's vision.

547
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,380
Scott: There's progress, huge amounts of progress.

548
00:25:26,482 --> 00:25:27,214
Scott: And you can see it.

549
00:25:28,122 --> 00:25:32,160
Scott: Whenever you see this game at a convention, you can see the incredible progress.

550
00:25:33,102 --> 00:25:39,440
Scott: The Monaco that I saw at PAX was 20 times better than any Monaco I've seen previously.

551
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,980
Rym: And the last Monaco I saw was something I would pay money for already.

552
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,079
Scott: I want it more than I ever wanted it.

553
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:51,520
Scott: And the two or three times I was near the booth, every time I was near the Monaco, I didn't actually go up to it because it's Monaco.

554
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,077
Scott: I knew I didn't spend time on it.

555
00:25:53,821 --> 00:25:56,580
Scott: There was crazy crowd and crazy excitement.

556
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,180
Rym: People were yelling and screaming.

557
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:02,699
Scott: I'm all about Monaco.

558
00:26:03,286 --> 00:26:03,800
Scott: I saw him.

559
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,259
Scott: I was all about it.

560
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,919
Scott: Now I'm even more all about it.

561
00:26:07,742 --> 00:26:10,420
Rym: That crowd was like, oh, oh, oh, around it.

562
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,739
Rym: And I saw him standing there.

563
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:16,580
Rym: And as soon as the crowd went, oh, he had this little smirk like, I got this.

564
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:19,400
Scott: You can tell that he has refined it so well.

565
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:24,240
Scott: I mean, when this game has just created such excitement all the time that it's a winner.

566
00:26:24,723 --> 00:26:26,160
Rym: But this is, I guess, my point.

567
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:37,180
Rym: Monaco at prime impressed me more than pretty much anything I saw at PAX East Expo Hall.

568
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,160
Rym: Most of the indie games that were real, like the one that got a lot of buzz.

569
00:26:42,582 --> 00:26:43,780
Rym: Two games that got a lot of buzz.

570
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,055
Rym: One was indie and one wasn't.

571
00:26:46,423 --> 00:26:48,220
Rym: Once I looked at them, I didn't care anymore.

572
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,940
Scott: Well, there were the two Square Enix ones.

573
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,260
Rym: So people were like, yeah, there's this Final Fantasy rhythm game.

574
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:53,759
Rym: I was like, what?

575
00:26:54,341 --> 00:27:01,319
Scott: It was pretty much just a normal rhythm game, sort of like Elite Beat Agents or Hatsune Miku Project D.Va.

576
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,940
Rym: I'm already tired of that genre.

577
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,160
Scott: Generic tapping on the cymbals rhythm game.

578
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:07,540
Rym: It's really one step above pop music.

579
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:11,820
Scott: But it happened to have Final Fantasy nostalgia in the background as the pictures.

580
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,404
Rym: That was it.

581
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,140
Rym: I was so excited about it.

582
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:19,485
Scott: If I'm going to play one of those, I'll just play the Hatsune Miku one or maybe... DDR.

583
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:20,560
Scott: Just go all the way back.

584
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,460
Scott: Exactly, right?

585
00:27:21,822 --> 00:27:24,500
Scott: The other game was made by, it was also Square Enix.

586
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:31,898
Scott: It was made by the lady, I think, who made Nervacular Drop, which was the game that Portal came from.

587
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,920
Scott: And it was like Quantum Conundrum, I think.

588
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,055
Scott: And it didn't look like it had, I mean, I didn't look that closely at it.

589
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:40,140
Scott: I didn't wait in line to play it.

590
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:40,878
Rym: It looked cool.

591
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,840
Scott: It looked cool, but it didn't look like it had that drastic innovation.

592
00:27:44,941 --> 00:27:48,740
Scott: It was a typical 3D first person clever puzzle-y game.

593
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:55,000
Scott: You know, throw the object into the other area, then somehow figure out how to get in that area without dying.

594
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,860
Scott: And you know, the typical kind of stuff.

595
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,960
Scott: And I was like, I think it had some sort of, you know, quantum aspect to it that was unique.

596
00:28:02,001 --> 00:28:03,380
Rym: It was in four dimensions, I think.

597
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,082
Scott: Was it?

598
00:28:04,162 --> 00:28:07,060
Scott: No, that was a different, it might have been the same, also in four dimensions.

599
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,298
Scott: But the four dimensional game I saw was like an isometric view game.

600
00:28:12,318 --> 00:28:13,020
Scott: that was a different game.

601
00:28:13,263 --> 00:28:14,579
Rym: Oh yeah, you're right, you're right.

602
00:28:15,081 --> 00:28:18,279
Rym: No, the other game I was going to talk about, because a lot of people were talking about it.

603
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:27,858
Rym: But then when I saw what it was, it was on the level of the push blocks around games that I played as shareware on my computer 20 years ago.

604
00:28:29,261 --> 00:28:31,839
Rym: The Not Without You, the little blue things trying to escape from the lab.

605
00:28:33,923 --> 00:28:35,819
Rym: You had to get all the guys into a red door at the same time?

606
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,018
Rym: You talked about it with me at length, and I know this, because I was going over the video from PAX.

607
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,738
Scott: The game called Not Without You.

608
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,519
Rym: Scott, I was going over the video at PAX.

609
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,660
Rym: You and I were standing, watching this game, having a conversation about it.

610
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:55,580
Rym: In fact, you said, wow, this looks like it would be great as part of some other game, but it's not a game by itself.

611
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,043
Scott: I'm looking it up right now.

612
00:28:57,324 --> 00:29:01,740
Scott: Oh, this one, the one that was just friggin' little miceys walking around and that was it.

613
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,820
Rym: But the thing is, the way people talked about this game, it was like this great indie game.

614
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:14,597
Rym: I looked at it, and it was a really interesting theme on top of what amounts to one puzzle in a Zelda dungeon.

615
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:21,400
Scott: Yeah, this is the kind of thing that would be like, you know when you play Layton, there's always that extra attached puzzle, like the hamster puzzle?

616
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:22,239
Rym: Yeah, this is that.

617
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,074
Scott: This is that, but it's the whole game.

618
00:29:24,256 --> 00:29:24,599
Scott: That's it.

619
00:29:25,341 --> 00:29:27,620
Scott: It's like, oh, there should be more here.

620
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:33,600
Rym: Yeah, it wasn't clever enough for a game that small, in my opinion, to warrant the attention it was getting.

621
00:29:33,942 --> 00:29:37,720
Rym: But then again, all the attention it was getting was people talking.

622
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:43,500
Rym: In the expo hall, there wasn't a big crowd around the game the few times I walked over there.

623
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,508
Scott: So anyway, that's a whole lot of PAX talking.

624
00:29:45,529 --> 00:29:47,520
Scott: Is there any other PAX things to bring up?

625
00:29:47,901 --> 00:29:52,840
Rym: I just want to note, we played a lot of the game we'll talk about in the second half of the show.

626
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:58,799
Rym: Tabletop was rockin', but they reconfigured the area a little bit, and as a result, in my...

627
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,060
Scott: They should take some area away from the queue room still and give it to more tables.

628
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,752
Rym: Yeah, the queue room's still only half filled.

629
00:30:04,772 --> 00:30:05,800
Rym: That could have been more tabletop.

630
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,520
Rym: Because tabletop was pretty fucking full, most of the con.

631
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:18,720
Rym: But yet, despite the fact that you could see secret tabletop from regular tabletop, secret tabletop always had free tables.

632
00:30:19,381 --> 00:30:22,400
Rym: Even though there were people looking for tables in normal tabletop.

633
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:27,577
Rym: It's like, guys, have you not figured out that you can go sit at those tables and play games?

634
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,340
Rym: They're right there.

635
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,360
Scott: I also want to make a note, Reaper Miniatures, they always have that thing that's like, paint a miniature.

636
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:34,153
Rym: Oh my god, there was like a 45 minute line for that.

637
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,468
Scott: They've had this in every PAX I've been to.

638
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:38,580
Scott: They have not changed their strategy at all.

639
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:43,080
Scott: And it's pretty much the deal is you walk up, you get a free miniature, and then you paint it for free, and then you leave.

640
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:43,580
Rym: Brilliant!

641
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,105
Scott: They've done this for years.

642
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:48,380
Scott: Only this year was there was a crazy line for it.

643
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,020
Scott: Because it was in a good location.

644
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,014
Scott: At PAX West, you can just walk up and do it whenever you want.

645
00:30:53,034 --> 00:30:54,120
Scott: It's been there the whole time.

646
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,500
Rym: Well, Scott, there's more people at PAX East.

647
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,320
Scott: I know, but suddenly it just got crazy popular for some reason.

648
00:30:58,661 --> 00:31:03,099
Rym: Oh, so I made more inquiries into the BCEC.

649
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:08,460
Rym: Because remember last year I acted as press and tried to get them to give me their fire code numbers and they wouldn't give them to me?

650
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:18,120
Rym: So I have done pretty good authority that the BCEC right now has about the same capacity that the BCC in Baltimore did before they added the Hilton.

651
00:31:18,703 --> 00:31:19,168
Rym: So around 25-26,000.

652
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,940
Rym: So it means PAX is about the size that Otakon was before they expanded the Hilton.

653
00:31:27,061 --> 00:31:27,659
Scott: That seems about right.

654
00:31:27,781 --> 00:31:29,439
Rym: Yeah, so it's about Otakon size.

655
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:31,879
Rym: Which is just interesting to know.

656
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:38,120
Rym: Anime Boston was only a few thousand under that, but it was in the Hinds.

657
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,674
Scott: But Anime Boston was way bigger than it's been before.

658
00:31:40,694 --> 00:31:41,900
Scott: It was 22,000.

659
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:47,340
Rym: Yup, but when I went over to Anime Boston, because the Hinds is so tiny, you couldn't walk.

660
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,940
Rym: Like, I could not walk through the halls.

661
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:52,520
Scott: Yeah, it was very crowded there.

662
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:57,535
Rym: Granted, the only parts of Anime Boston we saw were the reg room and the panel room we were in.

663
00:31:57,575 --> 00:31:59,380
Rym: that was in the same hallway as the reg room.

664
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,843
Scott: That was all Sheraton parts.

665
00:32:00,903 --> 00:32:05,899
Scott: Remember, Anime Boston, though, has the Sheraton, which gives them additional space above the Hinds.

666
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,299
Rym: Yup, but not that much.

667
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,798
Scott: Which the first PAX East did not do.

668
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:12,113
Scott: It's not that much space, but it is still space.

669
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:13,380
Scott: It counts as something.

670
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,140
Rym: We took a cab over there, did our two events, and then left.

671
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,854
Rym: We did the GeekNights tabletop workshop, which was packed.

672
00:32:19,934 --> 00:32:21,040
Rym: Like, people got turned away.

673
00:32:21,328 --> 00:32:21,740
Rym: Yeah, crazy.

674
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:30,580
Rym: And the thing is, we taught some hardcore board games, and it was hard to tell, because Scott's teaching Puerto Rico, which takes exactly 40 minutes.

675
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,137
Rym: And the crowd was just silently watching, no reaction.

676
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,756
Scott: And they were smiling and nodding, and I'm like, "You guys got

677
00:32:36,776 --> 00:32:36,937
Scott: this?".

678
00:32:37,381 --> 00:32:40,615
Rym: The whole time, though, I was like, "Are they just looking for an excuse to

679
00:32:40,655 --> 00:32:40,876
Rym: leave?".

680
00:32:40,896 --> 00:32:41,860
Rym: Because no one was like...

681
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,785
Scott: They weren't leaving.

682
00:32:42,865 --> 00:32:43,709
Scott: They were looking at me.

683
00:32:43,749 --> 00:32:45,800
Scott: They were paying attention, as far as I could tell.

684
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,768
Scott: But I was like, "Is this

685
00:32:47,828 --> 00:32:48,310
Scott: working?".

686
00:32:48,632 --> 00:32:50,420
Scott: And then they were able to play Puerto Rico.

687
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,584
Rym: Oh my God, yeah.

688
00:32:51,905 --> 00:32:53,008
Rym: And Carcassonne, same thing.

689
00:32:53,028 --> 00:32:56,218
Rym: But then when I sat them down, we got all these games of Carcassonne and Puerto Rico going.

690
00:32:56,238 --> 00:32:56,740
Rym: It was a ride.

691
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,060
Rym: We were doing that at every PAX.

692
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,020
Rym: In fact, we're going to step it up, I think, at PAX Prime.

693
00:33:02,701 --> 00:33:04,168
Rym: But we did a money-making game.

694
00:33:04,188 --> 00:33:04,891
Rym: It went really well.

695
00:33:04,952 --> 00:33:06,680
Rym: I should be able to get it up on YouTube.

696
00:33:07,421 --> 00:33:12,460
Rym: And we actually got a lot of feedback from it, or from people who went to it, even though we didn't take any questions.

697
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,338
Rym: And actually, some game devs came up, and they were like, "Yeah, I didn't think about

698
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:17,600
Rym: that.".

699
00:33:17,802 --> 00:33:18,699
Scott: No one thinks about that.

700
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,147
Rym: One guy said something great.

701
00:33:20,569 --> 00:33:21,152
Rym: He came up to me.

702
00:33:21,192 --> 00:33:22,157
Rym: He was like, "I know I gotta leave.

703
00:33:22,217 --> 00:33:22,639
Rym: I know you're in a

704
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:22,840
Rym: hurry.".

705
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,260
Rym: Because we literally were booking to Anime Boston, like, right then.

706
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:29,736
Rym: He was like, "I just realized that I ruined my

707
00:33:29,776 --> 00:33:30,037
Rym: vision.".

708
00:33:31,163 --> 00:33:31,878
Rym: That's all he said.

709
00:33:32,801 --> 00:33:33,808
Rym: And he was like, "Thank you.

710
00:33:34,131 --> 00:33:34,998
Rym: Maybe I can fix

711
00:33:35,058 --> 00:33:35,098
Rym: it.".

712
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,872
Rym: So dude, whoever you were, I didn't get any contact info.

713
00:33:38,093 --> 00:33:39,520
Rym: I want to know what game you were working on.

714
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,039
Rym: I want to know if we helped you, if it was too late.

715
00:33:50,431 --> 00:33:52,730
Rym: The things of the day!

716
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,930
Scott: So, um, it's been a while since we've done an episode.

717
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:57,523
Scott: Been a while?

718
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:00,590
Scott: Yeah, since then, the baseball has started.

719
00:34:01,413 --> 00:34:02,569
Rym: Oh, baseball.

720
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:07,290
Scott: Most people don't care about the baseballs, especially those who listen to the nerdy shows.

721
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,364
Rym: Yeah, you should, but that's a separate argument.

722
00:34:09,405 --> 00:34:10,030
Rym: We've had that before.

723
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:10,976
Rym: Well, no, no, no.

724
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:12,150
Rym: Sports, not baseball.

725
00:34:13,232 --> 00:34:14,650
Scott: Even Rims hating on the baseballs.

726
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:17,389
Rym: I really just don't give a shit about baseball anymore.

727
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:23,290
Scott: Anyway, here's a funny video about Mets Seasonal Affective Disorder, which I have.

728
00:34:23,511 --> 00:34:24,208
Rym: It's a real thing.

729
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:26,050
Scott: I want to educate you about my disease.

730
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:30,210
Scott: Like, everyone who has a disease wants to educate everyone about it so they know all about it.

731
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:32,069
Scott: Well, here's the disease I have.

732
00:34:34,052 --> 00:34:41,449
Scott: The only reason it doesn't seem like I have it is because I also have another disease, which is Aw, fuck yeah, the sun's out, which counter-balances.

733
00:34:42,591 --> 00:34:47,550
Rym: But, well, there's also Stanley Cuppies, which always keeps me happy for like six months after they happen.

734
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,408
Scott: Well, it's right now.

735
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:57,710
Rym: But the thing is, that video, as funny as it is, could have been just one picture of that little baseball dude.

736
00:34:58,732 --> 00:35:00,890
Rym: Because it's kind of like mocked up like the Prozac ad.

737
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:02,258
Rym: So I would have been like, "Ah,

738
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:02,983
Rym: Mets.".

739
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:10,450
Rym: Thing is, I didn't understand, but now I live in Queens, and it's like I inherited Mets fandom just by moving here.

740
00:35:10,713 --> 00:35:11,970
Rym: It's like I got infected with it.

741
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:12,990
Scott: It's an area of effects.

742
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:13,495
Rym: I know.

743
00:35:14,024 --> 00:35:14,370
Rym: AOE.

744
00:35:14,691 --> 00:35:15,330
Rym: AOE damage.

745
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,567
Rym: So I got two things of the day.

746
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,970
Rym: Because I can't just, you know, Scott said it'd be cheating to use my main thing of the day.

747
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:29,730
Rym: So my secondary one, on the New York subway occasionally, some indignant person will get into a bitch fight with someone else.

748
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,650
Rym: And who cares who's at fault, these fights are always stupid.

749
00:35:33,212 --> 00:35:33,809
Rym: But it happens.

750
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:42,170
Rym: And this is a video of a guy who breaks this fight up in possibly the best way you can break up a fight.

751
00:35:42,572 --> 00:35:43,688
Rym: Short of pulling your pants down.

752
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,990
Rym: I wish he had pulled his pants down.

753
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,189
Rym: That would have sealed the deal.

754
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:49,510
Rym: But this is just great in the look on his face.

755
00:35:50,451 --> 00:35:53,970
Rym: So my real thing of the day is something that we orchestrated at PAX.

756
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:59,486
Rym: Because, you know, every year we always try to come up with something we can do with the Q&A.

757
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:00,570
Rym: that'll be funny.

758
00:36:01,295 --> 00:36:03,290
Rym: But you know there's a line.

759
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:08,988
Scott: Well the thing about the Penny Arcade Q&A at PAX is not really a Q&A.

760
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,510
Scott: There are no Q's that Mike and Jerry have not aged.

761
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:13,108
Rym: Well, well, well.

762
00:36:14,935 --> 00:36:15,597
Rym: I want to say one thing.

763
00:36:15,637 --> 00:36:19,410
Rym: At the first PAX East, it was mostly Q's from fans.

764
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,710
Rym: This was the first time they'd ever seen them in person.

765
00:36:21,894 --> 00:36:22,148
Scott: Exactly.

766
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:23,981
Rym: But now it's like Prime.

767
00:36:24,122 --> 00:36:25,230
Rym: It's one chance.

768
00:36:27,195 --> 00:36:32,730
Scott: If you are such a fan of Penny Arcade specifically, and you're not at PAX just for gaming in general, right?

769
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,089
Scott: You already know everything there is to know.

770
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,840
Scott: There is very few Q's.

771
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,390
Scott: you can A unless it's something recent.

772
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:42,490
Scott: Like you have a question about something that happened in a recent Penny Arcade TV episode.

773
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:47,270
Rym: Or you're asking them a question to try to get them to do something.

774
00:36:49,072 --> 00:36:51,750
Scott: So it's not really a Q&A even though that's what it's called.

775
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:54,090
Scott: Because there are very few Q's left unaid.

776
00:36:54,232 --> 00:36:55,107
Rym: They should rename it.

777
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,990
Scott: What it is, is it's more of a request show.

778
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,430
Scott: Like you call in to the DJ and say play this song.

779
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:02,509
Scott: That's what it is.

780
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:06,622
Scott: You go up there and you don't really Q. You instead sort of prompt.

781
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,830
Scott: It's like hey, you're up there.

782
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:13,050
Scott: This whole point of, the reason we're all in this room is because you're entertaining guys.

783
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,050
Scott: And we want you to entertain us right now.

784
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,530
Scott: But you don't know, have any specific thing to do to entertain us.

785
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:19,333
Scott: It's not like this.

786
00:37:19,393 --> 00:37:23,770
Scott: is that Acquisitions Incorporated where you have planned out your D&D to entertain us with.

787
00:37:24,391 --> 00:37:27,990
Scott: It's not the make a strip where you're going to make a strip to entertain us with.

788
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:33,610
Rym: It's more like a game of verbal volleyball where everyone comes up to the mic and puts up a set.

789
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:37,099
Scott: Right, it's like you need to tell them what they should do to entertain you.

790
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:44,410
Scott: And you need to tell them a good thing otherwise it's not going to be very entertaining.

791
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:48,630
Scott: So you have to go up and be like hey guys, if you did this it would be really awesome right now.

792
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,469
Scott: If you did this it would be awesome right now.

793
00:37:50,671 --> 00:37:54,310
Rym: Well it's also, I would liken it almost to holding court.

794
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:57,690
Rym: It's like now is your chance, the audience with the king.

795
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:02,130
Rym: The king will listen to you for maybe 30 seconds and then pass judgement.

796
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:02,813
Scott: That's right.

797
00:38:03,819 --> 00:38:05,610
Scott: And the king is pretty good in his judgement.

798
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:08,049
Scott: He's like whoa enforcer, scary dude, get him out of here.

799
00:38:08,972 --> 00:38:14,790
Rym: There is a great moment where, to talk about the line, you can try to pull funny shit here.

800
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:19,750
Rym: But there's a line beyond which you're kind of an unfunny attention-horring douchebag.

801
00:38:20,111 --> 00:38:27,277
Scott: Right, it's like even if you're good at it and you're doing something that is entertaining and well done, it can't be about you.

802
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:30,130
Scott: Even no matter how good it is, if it's about you it's wrong.

803
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:34,870
Scott: Because it's the, I think I'll steal Mike's own joke, it's the Penny Arcade expo.

804
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,008
Scott: It's not the Geek Guys expo.

805
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:40,270
Scott: It's about Penny Arcade, you have to make them look good, not you.

806
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:43,169
Rym: So we always try to come up with some fun thing to do.

807
00:38:43,812 --> 00:38:46,250
Rym: Like we did the Action Castle thing that one year.

808
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:50,363
Scott: They have no idea that it was the same people doing all those things.

809
00:38:53,252 --> 00:38:54,197
Rym: We flew John St.

810
00:38:54,217 --> 00:38:57,229
Rym: John in on our own dime and made him get up there.

811
00:38:58,951 --> 00:39:02,230
Rym: So this year, what we did, and we thought of it at the last second.

812
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,101
Rym: It was my idea.

813
00:39:03,121 --> 00:39:03,850
Rym: It was Scott's idea.

814
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:04,472
Rym: That's right.

815
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:09,270
Scott: And thanks to Pete, I knew he would have it, and he managed to pull through.

816
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:10,528
Scott: He's so reliable.

817
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:13,670
Rym: So Scott simply asked them to read a book to us.

818
00:39:14,031 --> 00:39:19,410
Scott: Well I was gonna be like, hey look, my original thing was like, hey, I'll give you this book if you read it to us.

819
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,756
Scott: But he's like, oh we have that book.

820
00:39:20,797 --> 00:39:23,270
Scott: And I'm like, oh, well will you read us this book?

821
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:26,490
Scott: Because I know they'd be really good at reading books, especially Jerry.

822
00:39:27,111 --> 00:39:29,050
Scott: And it's a children's book, so it only takes like three minutes.

823
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:33,050
Scott: So I said hey, and he read us the book, and he did a really good job.

824
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,230
Rym: It was one of my highlights of facts.

825
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,170
Scott: Perhaps the best job that could be done.

826
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:41,970
Rym: There's that moment at about two minutes and 48 seconds that I can tell because I get the Google Analytics.

827
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:43,869
Rym: People keep re-watching that.

828
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:47,030
Rym: I can see that you're re-watching it, people.

829
00:39:48,591 --> 00:39:51,730
Rym: There's this big hump in audience retention right there.

830
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:52,158
Scott: Nice.

831
00:39:53,512 --> 00:39:54,669
Rym: So that is my thing of the day.

832
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:57,188
Rym: In the meantime, ZenkaiCon's coming up.

833
00:39:57,551 --> 00:39:58,408
Rym: Be there doing some stuff.

834
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:01,830
Rym: Unless I suddenly go to Turkey, in which case I'm sending Scott on his own.

835
00:40:02,292 --> 00:40:03,219
Scott: Well you're not sending me.

836
00:40:03,299 --> 00:40:04,730
Scott: I'd be going on my own.

837
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,924
Scott: And would I even go?

838
00:40:06,944 --> 00:40:07,850
Scott: How would I get there?

839
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:12,030
Rym: Well if I bail because of Turkey, I think I have a legitimate excuse.

840
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,640
Rym: If you bail because of eh, well...

841
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,049
Scott: But how would I get there?

842
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:16,929
Scott: I don't know.

843
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,948
Scott: I need Scott Johnson to come get me.

844
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:19,999
Scott: You have money.

845
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,850
Rym: Take a train.

846
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,110
Scott: Train station.

847
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,230
Rym: Just get your own car.

848
00:40:25,153 --> 00:40:26,030
Scott: Where am I going to get a car from?

849
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:26,749
Scott: Get a Zipcar.

850
00:40:27,192 --> 00:40:28,750
Scott: Why would I pay all that just for ZenkaiCon?

851
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,690
Rym: Because it's really useful.

852
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,069
Scott: Yeah, but that's a lot of money for something I'm going to use once.

853
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:33,330
Rym: It's not that much money.

854
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:37,110
Rym: Anyway, ConnectiCon is coming up in some time.

855
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:45,330
Rym: But if you want to do a presentation at ConnectiCon, you know who's in charge of panels, workshops, ballrooms, everything but main events in terms of programming?

856
00:40:45,655 --> 00:40:45,720
Rym: Us.

857
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:46,401
Rym: Us guys.

858
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:47,214
Scott: You know what?

859
00:40:47,274 --> 00:40:49,170
Scott: It sucks because we don't have enough submissions.

860
00:40:49,650 --> 00:41:02,170
Rym: If you submit an event and you're a GeekNights listener and there's evidence that you were cool and the event is also cool, there's a good chance you'll get a panel room or a workshop room to do your shit in.

861
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,608
Scott: I'm going to be completely honest with you.

862
00:41:04,092 --> 00:41:05,970
Scott: We're really kind of somewhat desperate.

863
00:41:06,535 --> 00:41:08,030
Rym: Scott, we're not that desperate.

864
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,370
Scott: We're still slightly desperate.

865
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:18,350
Scott: If you submit something and we're not sure about you, we might give you some crack ass of dawn Friday slot to fill in the schedule.

866
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:19,969
Rym: Well, I'll put it this way.

867
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:31,110
Rym: We're not as desperate as you might be making it out to be because you have not seen the guest and gaming panels that are all happening that are being handled through another department that I'm handling all that.

868
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:31,690
Scott: That is true.

869
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:34,350
Scott: But we do have more rooms than last year.

870
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:37,830
Rym: Connecticut this year is going to be kind of awesome for one big reason.

871
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:42,530
Rym: We have 11 pretty sizable panel rooms.

872
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:47,769
Scott: Maybe we should like, I don't know, try to find, maybe like get the screenings to move out of the hotel.

873
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:49,629
Rym: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

874
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:50,229
Scott: One of those rooms?

875
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:50,966
Rym: No, no, no, no, no, no.

876
00:41:51,304 --> 00:41:51,348
Scott: No?

877
00:41:51,571 --> 00:41:52,868
Rym: No, because they have their own rooms.

878
00:41:53,871 --> 00:41:55,690
Scott: Yeah, but those are tiny rooms.

879
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,150
Rym: Yeah, no one goes to those things.

880
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:58,490
Scott: Because they're hidden where no one can find them.

881
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:01,190
Rym: No, because no one goes to screenings at cons anymore unless they're premiers.

882
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:02,268
Rym: They would if they were in a good room.

883
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:02,865
Rym: No.

884
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:03,874
Rym: No.

885
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,610
Rym: Plus, they want that stuff to go all night.

886
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,789
Rym: That's why they put it over there.

887
00:42:08,071 --> 00:42:08,630
Rym: Oh, that's true.

888
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:08,815
Rym: Yeah.

889
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:09,527
Rym: That's true.

890
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,330
Rym: That's why I do this side of the planning.

891
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,930
Rym: People do the other side of the planning.

892
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,010
Scott: We should do something.

893
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:16,490
Scott: I feel like we should use, you have these extra rooms.

894
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,005
Scott: I feel like we could do something in them.

895
00:42:18,025 --> 00:42:18,450
Scott: that's different.

896
00:42:18,651 --> 00:42:19,649
Rym: We're going to fill them, don't worry.

897
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:21,410
Rym: I got stuff to fill them with.

898
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:24,809
Rym: Anyway, and PEX Prime and PEX Dev are coming up.

899
00:42:25,531 --> 00:42:27,749
Rym: I think I'm going to PEX Dev just for, I want to see.

900
00:42:29,053 --> 00:42:48,350
Rym: Even though I'm not going to name names, but three game developers at three different major companies told me PEX Dev was pretty meh itself, but they qualified that by saying that the gaming that happened in the Westin after PEX Dev was epic.

901
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:49,869
Rym: I might go just for that.

902
00:42:51,031 --> 00:42:51,467
Scott: I have to see.

903
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,350
Scott: You know, there's the vacation day situation.

904
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:54,208
Rym: Well, I can just go.

905
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:55,930
Rym: I mean, in fact, I'll probably, my company.

906
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,110
Scott: There's the money situation.

907
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:00,650
Rym: My company will probably let me go if I, I can swing something.

908
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:01,326
Scott: We'll see.

909
00:43:01,956 --> 00:43:02,447
Scott: I'd like to.

910
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:03,247
Scott: I'll go.

911
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,010
Scott: If I, you know.

912
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:13,890
Rym: Plus, I may, I will be legitimately, like for real, published game publisher by that point due to something I'll talk about in a bit.

913
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:18,969
Scott: Well, I don't want to say something to be shit talking, but you know, I've shit talked a lot in my day.

914
00:43:19,332 --> 00:43:20,890
Rym: Oh, shit talking, it's shit talk time?

915
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:24,010
Scott: I currently have a thing that is half done.

916
00:43:24,774 --> 00:43:26,565
Rym: I have a thing that is about 80% done?

917
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:28,830
Scott: I worked on it yesterday.

918
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,150
Scott: It is to make it half done.

919
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:34,710
Scott: It's going to be more than half done after I get home.

920
00:43:35,491 --> 00:43:39,745
Rym: I opened Illustrator to work on the layouts for the thing.

921
00:43:39,905 --> 00:43:41,616
Rym: that is, I'm working on this 80% done.

922
00:43:42,593 --> 00:43:43,570
Scott: So, I'm not promising.

923
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:44,808
Scott: I could just stop and shit talk.

924
00:43:45,651 --> 00:43:46,969
Scott: So, I'm not even going to say anything else.

925
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:56,310
Rym: Other than that, there's a tiny chance if we go to PEX Dev, we will in a technical sense both be able to say that we're not just talkers of games.

926
00:43:57,141 --> 00:43:57,408
Scott: I guess.

927
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:01,289
Rym: But that we are perhaps doers of games and not shitters of games.

928
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:04,469
Scott: I think it's not a game, but yeah.

929
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,270
Rym: Yeah, but we'll see.

930
00:44:06,772 --> 00:44:08,330
Rym: I was guessing at what you were referring to.

931
00:44:09,592 --> 00:44:11,770
Rym: It's one of three things in my estimation.

932
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:14,790
Rym: Anyway, anyway, but PAX Prime's coming up.

933
00:44:14,954 --> 00:44:15,270
Rym: We'll be there.

934
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:16,047
Rym: You should be there too.

935
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:18,189
Rym: Buyer badges the day they go up.

936
00:44:19,732 --> 00:44:20,690
Scott: Oh, yeah, it's of course.

937
00:44:21,413 --> 00:44:22,790
Rym: Oh, yeah, and the Book Club book is Hunger Games.

938
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:24,010
Rym: We'll do a show on it Thursday.

939
00:44:24,431 --> 00:44:25,328
Scott: I finished reading it.

940
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:26,845
Rym: So, yeah.

941
00:44:27,371 --> 00:44:27,988
Scott: Oh, I also.

942
00:44:28,855 --> 00:44:29,590
Rym: Oh, also what?

943
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:29,950
Rym: Never mind.

944
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:30,286
Rym: What's that?

945
00:44:31,224 --> 00:44:31,310
Scott: No.

946
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:32,990
Rym: So, Mafia.

947
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,669
Rym: I can't believe we never did a show on this.

948
00:44:35,211 --> 00:44:35,970
Scott: Did we really never do a show?

949
00:44:36,233 --> 00:44:37,770
Rym: I couldn't find one in the search.

950
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:44,929
Rym: So, if it is not in fact, if we have in fact done a show on it, I'd like to open a ticket with you because our website search doesn't work.

951
00:44:45,914 --> 00:44:46,170
Scott: Alright.

952
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:47,720
Scott: You should use the search.

953
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:48,770
Scott: that's in the website admin.

954
00:44:49,355 --> 00:44:51,210
Rym: So, we know the game as Mafia.

955
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:58,030
Rym: It was taught to us in sort of a handed down through the generations format at RIT.

956
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:09,530
Scott: I seem to actually remember like kids at my middle school would play this, but I wouldn't because I was playing Magic the Gathering, but I remember kids at my middle school played a game called Mafia and they sat in a circle and I don't remember anything else about it.

957
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:14,930
Rym: So, kids at my middle school played a game they called Mafia that looked similar, but was actually completely different.

958
00:45:14,951 --> 00:45:15,410
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

959
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:19,070
Scott: It might have been that same game that they played at your middle school because I was playing Magic the Gathering.

960
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:25,730
Rym: They'd sit around during the day quietly and then people would like blink at each other and there was this whole thing.

961
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:27,590
Scott: No, this was definitely a game where they sat in a circle.

962
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:30,650
Scott: So, it was much more similar to the game that we play.

963
00:45:31,672 --> 00:45:39,850
Rym: Yeah, but Mafia, Werewolf, Assassin, I've seen there's a million names for this game and the game has a million different rule sets.

964
00:45:40,411 --> 00:45:50,389
Rym: So, I think I'll just explain it with the passed down rules and proper nouns that we used from our days at RIT.

965
00:45:51,211 --> 00:45:52,229
Rym: The game is pretty simple.

966
00:45:52,952 --> 00:45:54,129
Rym: You get a bunch of friends.

967
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:56,750
Rym: Twelve is the optimal number in my opinion.

968
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:58,068
Rym: You sit them around.

969
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:03,787
Rym: You give everyone a card from like a deck of cards and most people are just dudes in the village.

970
00:46:05,191 --> 00:46:11,350
Rym: One dude is the angel, one dude is the archangel, and a few dudes are members of the Mafia.

971
00:46:13,632 --> 00:46:18,490
Rym: So, there's a moderator who usually at RIT was this really creepy dude who made us touch his nipples.

972
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:20,267
Rym: Remember that?

973
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,490
Scott: What was that guy's name?

974
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:22,210
Rym: I know his name.

975
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:28,709
Rym: I'm just not saying it on the show because I don't want to give a first and last name of a dude that I just disparaged on a public show.

976
00:46:29,191 --> 00:46:36,450
Rym: But, suffice it to say dude, consider yourself thusly disparaged because I had to touch your nipple every time we played this game.

977
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:38,309
Rym: It was really uncomfortable and creepy.

978
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:41,730
Scott: I thought it was Vampire Tag we had to touch.

979
00:46:42,072 --> 00:46:43,750
Rym: Yeah, also when he ran Mafia.

980
00:46:44,532 --> 00:46:46,409
Rym: He'd ask for the cards back and he'd be like, "No, no, no.

981
00:46:46,991 --> 00:46:47,213
Rym: In the

982
00:46:47,254 --> 00:46:47,638
Rym: pocket.".

983
00:46:49,916 --> 00:46:50,550
Scott: In shirt pocket.

984
00:46:51,452 --> 00:46:51,561
Rym: Yeah.

985
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:52,710
Rym: Yeah.

986
00:46:54,218 --> 00:46:55,810
Rym: So, everyone gets a role, secretly.

987
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:57,470
Rym: No one knows what anyone else's role is.

988
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:58,610
Rym: You can't show anyone your card.

989
00:46:59,295 --> 00:46:59,790
Rym: That's cheating.

990
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:03,986
Rym: And then the moderator tells a little story about the Mafia and everyone has to put their heads down.

991
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:07,948
Rym: And then he'll say something like, "My Mafia, wake

992
00:47:08,068 --> 00:47:08,129
Rym: up!".

993
00:47:08,712 --> 00:47:11,430
Rym: And the Mafia all raise their heads while everyone else's heads are down.

994
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:16,830
Rym: And everyone's poking at stuff, making noise so you don't hear people shirt shuffling.

995
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:20,150
Rym: And then he asks the Mafia who they would like to murder.

996
00:47:20,951 --> 00:47:24,550
Rym: And they all kind of squabble and point at someone and go head down.

997
00:47:25,431 --> 00:47:34,887
Rym: And then the Angel wakes up and picks a person and the moderator says publicly something like, "That person is or is not a member of the

998
00:47:35,088 --> 00:47:35,550
Rym: Mafia.".

999
00:47:36,593 --> 00:47:38,490
Rym: And then the Archangel wakes up and points at someone.

1000
00:47:39,331 --> 00:47:40,570
Scott: If you have an Archangel, right?

1001
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:45,270
Rym: Yes, and if the Mafia try to kill the person who the Archangel protected, they don't die.

1002
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:50,765
Rym: But otherwise, the moderator walks around and then will tap the person on the back who's dead.

1003
00:47:51,192 --> 00:47:58,890
Rym: And then everyone wakes up and the person who's dead flips over their card and you learn that they were just a citizen, hopefully not the Archangel or the Angel.

1004
00:48:00,091 --> 00:48:02,829
Rym: And then the townsfolk argue about who to lynch.

1005
00:48:03,891 --> 00:48:13,469
Rym: The game ends when either all the Mafia die or the Mafia are equal in number to the townsfolk, in which case they just rise up and murder everyone and the town is theirs.

1006
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:17,130
Rym: And that's pretty much the whole game.

1007
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:19,609
Rym: Now during the day, and this is really key.

1008
00:48:20,473 --> 00:48:26,450
Rym: I don't know what rules other people play with, but in my opinion, these are the rules you should use because they make the best game.

1009
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:27,750
Scott: But we never use these rules.

1010
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:29,330
Rym: We use these rules.

1011
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:31,270
Rym: Well, you're thinking of something separate.

1012
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:34,250
Rym: I use these rules to a fault.

1013
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:37,628
Rym: You must use these rules to a fault.

1014
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:42,150
Rym: The pointing rule must be followed absolutely and without exception.

1015
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:51,010
Rym: So you can talk all you want and you can tell experienced Mafia players because they will point with crooked fingers to not trigger the point.

1016
00:48:52,053 --> 00:48:53,490
Scott: Or they'll fist at people.

1017
00:48:54,435 --> 00:48:55,529
Rym: And then there's fisting jokes.

1018
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:57,148
Rym: So the way it works is like this.

1019
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:06,349
Rym: If you can talk all you want, the moment you point at a person, literally that second, everyone has to shut the fuck up.

1020
00:49:06,731 --> 00:49:07,889
Rym: No one is allowed to say a word.

1021
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:12,350
Rym: The moderator then says, "An accusation has been made.

1022
00:49:12,975 --> 00:49:13,501
Rym: Are there any

1023
00:49:13,602 --> 00:49:13,987
Rym: seconds?".

1024
00:49:14,632 --> 00:49:20,289
Rym: If no one points to second the accusation within five or so seconds, then we go back to talking.

1025
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:28,370
Rym: But if there is a second, the person accused has 30 seconds to defend themself, no one else can talk, and then there's an immediate one, two, three vote.

1026
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:31,910
Rym: Majority vote, they are killed, flip over their card, and then everyone goes to sleep.

1027
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:34,930
Rym: You better hope that that's a member of the Mafia.

1028
00:49:35,311 --> 00:49:36,210
Scott: Well, the Mafia doesn't.

1029
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:43,090
Scott: The Mafia wants it to kill a person because they always kill a person at night no matter what unless the archangel saves them or something.

1030
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,380
Scott: So if they can kill a person during the day as well.

1031
00:49:45,702 --> 00:49:51,938
Scott: that's a civilian, they're well on the way to winning very, very quickly because they're killing basically two civilians per day.

1032
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:56,786
Rym: Now, some of you might be thinking that the game seems easy to solve or is simple.

1033
00:49:58,631 --> 00:50:09,270
Rym: Now, with these rules, it is not easy to solve, it is not simple, and while it would be arbitrary, people are dumbasses and the psychology actually matters a lot.

1034
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:12,090
Scott: The game pretty much comes down entirely to psychology, right?

1035
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:20,410
Scott: You can just tell most people can't keep a straight face, they can't act, they act differently in one game than they did in the previous game.

1036
00:50:21,371 --> 00:50:25,330
Scott: Someone who is talking a lot is eerily silent compared to the previous playthrough.

1037
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:27,609
Rym: Now, if you're playing with strangers, it works pretty well.

1038
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:30,390
Scott: Someone that you know to be nervous is suddenly talking a lot.

1039
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:33,629
Rym: But among friends, we played this a lot at RIT.

1040
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:35,224
Scott: A lot.

1041
00:50:35,515 --> 00:50:35,766
Rym: A lot.

1042
00:50:36,532 --> 00:50:49,169
Rym: And it got to the point to where no matter who was in the game, me, Scott Johnson, and our friend Luke Morgan would just be murdered by the townsfolk or the mafia as fast as possible just to shut them up.

1043
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:52,850
Scott: Doesn't matter what anyone says, we're killing these people on night one no matter what.

1044
00:50:52,950 --> 00:51:01,090
Rym: Just to shut them up because they're going to make this game a whole production and whoever's side they're on, if Rims the mafia, we're fucked so let's just kill him.

1045
00:51:01,351 --> 00:51:03,790
Rym: If he's a civilian, we're better off with him dead.

1046
00:51:04,938 --> 00:51:05,410
Scott: That's right.

1047
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:09,636
Rym: The mafia usually won't kill me though because they'd think the townsfolk are going to lynch him anyway.

1048
00:51:09,656 --> 00:51:10,790
Rym: so why should we waste our kill?

1049
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:17,590
Rym: Sometimes the mafia would kill me at night anyway even if I was mafia just because.

1050
00:51:18,852 --> 00:51:22,070
Rym: Now, the game is great and it's super fun.

1051
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:38,730
Rym: The trouble is it's really tricky to run because if you don't just know game design and you try to balance this game with a number of players other than 12, you're going to fuck it up and the game's not going to be fun for people.

1052
00:51:39,071 --> 00:51:48,470
Scott: If you have too many mafias, then the mafia will just win almost immediately because they'll kill a citizen at night and then they'll kill a citizen during the day and then it's over.

1053
00:51:49,151 --> 00:51:56,006
Scott: If there's too few mafias, it'll be almost impossible for the mafia to win because there's not enough of them.

1054
00:51:58,531 --> 00:52:07,607
Scott: It's like, okay, they kill a person at night and they kill a person during the day but as soon as one of them is found out, it's like, well, there's so few of us now, we're fucked.

1055
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:20,590
Scott: The other problem, so what you had to do to balance the game out is you have to have the right number of mafias and then you have to mix in the other optional roles in the correct proportion because those are the balancing act.

1056
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:28,037
Scott: It's like, well, an angel putting that in there is a civilian but a more powerful civilian so you can have one extra.

1057
00:52:28,077 --> 00:52:31,710
Scott: mafia is balanced by having an angel and then you put an archangel.

1058
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:34,509
Scott: It's like, well, that also balances off having too many mafias.

1059
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:35,628
Rym: Yup, and now the rub.

1060
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:39,909
Rym: One, everyone wants to run this game because it seems super fun.

1061
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:48,290
Rym: Unless you're practiced at this, running mafia is actually a training skill, I would say.

1062
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:55,690
Scott: Yeah, you could since you know everything and you're not even playing, you're just sort of making the game work, it's very easy to ruin the whole game.

1063
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:58,426
Rym: For example, he is not a member of the, oh fuck.

1064
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:00,670
Scott: You said the word he, didn't you?

1065
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:02,450
Scott: So now someone knows something.

1066
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:02,966
Rym: Yup.

1067
00:53:03,633 --> 00:53:06,150
Rym: Or you don't remember who the mafia are.

1068
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:09,570
Scott: Yeah, it's like mafia, wake up again, I forgot who you were.

1069
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:25,650
Rym: And if you start introducing extra roles, if you forget who the godfather is, who's the marshal, the psycho killers, all these things, it gets increasingly complicated and I've seen so many people who think they can run it just fail.

1070
00:53:26,832 --> 00:53:36,289
Scott: You walk around and you see people hear your footsteps and you'll say something like, Angel, is this the person you want to know who they are?

1071
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:36,770
Scott: Yup.

1072
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:41,527
Scott: And meanwhile you're standing right near that person, so now everyone hears where your voice is coming from.

1073
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:43,409
Scott: It's like you gotta keep walking around.

1074
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:45,390
Rym: Yup, there's all these tricks.

1075
00:53:45,911 --> 00:53:49,510
Rym: I could almost do a separate just Rym show where I explain how to run this goddamn game.

1076
00:53:50,251 --> 00:54:00,850
Rym: And to couple that, inexperienced people will look on, they'll Google around, and they'll find dozens of people's rules they've written for this kind of game.

1077
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:03,050
Scott: And everyone makes up their own rules and they're all different.

1078
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:05,330
Rym: Yup, everyone calls things by different names.

1079
00:54:05,391 --> 00:54:06,790
Scott: People don't even call it the same game.

1080
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,170
Scott: For us it's Wafia, but for other people it's Werewolf.

1081
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:13,030
Rym: And the game's been published because game mechanics are not really copyrightable.

1082
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:17,524
Scott: Yeah, a lot of different companies have printed and sold versions of this game under different names.

1083
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:20,810
Rym: The versions, from what people have told me, actually are straight up broken.

1084
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:23,410
Scott: A lot of them have a whole bunch of crazy rules in them.

1085
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:25,670
Scott: Just a whole bunch of made up wild stuff.

1086
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:27,470
Scott: Like, crazy cards!

1087
00:54:28,731 --> 00:54:33,270
Rym: I guess I've run this game enough to where you sort of have this sense in game design.

1088
00:54:34,031 --> 00:54:42,610
Rym: Like, for example, there's roles that exist solely to kill a bunch of people in a hurry if you have like 20 people playing to pare the game down quickly.

1089
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:48,468
Rym: You don't use those rules unless you have a large group of inexperienced players and you need the game to go quickly.

1090
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:52,270
Scott: Yeah, you actually need to understand the game just to set up the game, right?

1091
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:58,490
Scott: Because there's no, like, strict set of, you know, this is exactly how you should set the game up in every circumstance.

1092
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,630
Scott: There's no document that will tell you that.

1093
00:55:00,971 --> 00:55:12,510
Scott: You need to just sort of know, based on the people you have, how they behave, how many of them there are, you know, are they experienced, inexperienced, what set up for the game is going to make the game not suck.

1094
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,309
Scott: You just need to be able to figure that out.

1095
00:55:14,893 --> 00:55:17,870
Scott: And you can't do that if you don't know a lot.

1096
00:55:19,591 --> 00:55:37,110
Rym: Now, not to go into, I think I could spend a separate show about, you know, how to run, like I said and everything, but the game's pretty mathematically analyzable, which is interesting because if everyone at the table is smart, then you'd think the game is solvable.

1097
00:55:37,291 --> 00:55:44,470
Rym: and at PAX, I got to, because I know people have tried this bullshit before and I know it doesn't work, but on paper it should work.

1098
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:47,486
Rym: So Phil, in this case, was the one who was like, "I have a

1099
00:55:47,546 --> 00:55:47,888
Rym: system.".

1100
00:55:48,431 --> 00:55:53,230
Rym: And he had this whole system, so the game starts and he is like, "Everybody shut up!

1101
00:55:53,531 --> 00:55:53,969
Rym: Nobody point!

1102
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:54,810
Rym: Nobody do anything!

1103
00:55:55,514 --> 00:55:55,779
Rym: Hear me

1104
00:55:55,943 --> 00:55:56,045
Rym: out!".

1105
00:55:56,430 --> 00:56:02,229
Rym: And he starts to explain a system of the angel and archangel without revealing themselves, doing a certain pattern.

1106
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:12,710
Rym: Meanwhile, the Freemasons, one of them reveals themselves but the others don't, and it's a great system, and on paper, it's pretty much guaranteed to make the citizens win.

1107
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:18,070
Scott: But it doesn't work if the person who is promoting the system is in the mafia, right?

1108
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:21,010
Scott: Ah, but the system- Imagine if Phil had drawn the mafia card right away.

1109
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:37,707
Rym: So, the system has a way to get around that, whereby the person who has to run the system is a member of the Freemasons who comes forward and says to the audience, "Other Freemasons, stay silent if you agree that I am a

1110
00:56:37,748 --> 00:56:38,090
Rym: Freemason.".

1111
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:46,668
Rym: Because then the only recourse the mafia have is to step forward and pretend to be a Freemason, which could go very badly for them.

1112
00:56:47,671 --> 00:56:54,689
Scott: Simultaneously- The way Freemasons work is basically there are a few civilians who know that each other are civilians, but it's not all the civilians, it's only a few of them.

1113
00:56:55,090 --> 00:57:00,630
Scott: So there's like three civilians and they know that each other are safe so they won't vote for each other to die.

1114
00:57:00,861 --> 00:57:01,008
Rym: Yep.

1115
00:57:01,671 --> 00:57:03,009
Rym: So, the system's pretty good.

1116
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:08,430
Rym: And it's almost identical to a system that many people tried to do at RIT.

1117
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:25,808
Rym: And it is my supposition, I posit to you all, that it is impossible to actually implement because the system worked for one round, the next round somebody pointed and then everything went to shit and it was over.

1118
00:57:26,330 --> 00:57:39,448
Scott: The third round- You're on board with the system in every game, but no one can show anyone their cards, so shit will break loose if even one person strays from the pad.

1119
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:41,390
Rym: Also, you have to be very careful.

1120
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:49,470
Rym: We talk about this, there's an implied rule in hardcore tabletop board gaming that you cannot use external implements.

1121
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:55,210
Rym: If a game does not say you can use a pen and paper, you're not allowed to use a pen and paper during the game.

1122
00:57:55,471 --> 00:57:55,810
Scott: That's right.

1123
00:57:55,870 --> 00:58:02,488
Scott: And you'll see that in Mafia, what will happen is, it's a game that really has the honor system.

1124
00:58:04,112 --> 00:58:08,630
Scott: It's really easy to cheat, but people don't because they're not dicks.

1125
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:12,549
Rym: So, I would argue that if you cheat by accident, that's part of the game.

1126
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,590
Scott: It depends on how you cheated by accident.

1127
00:58:16,111 --> 00:58:20,449
Rym: If you say one of the Mafia laugh, well- That's fine.

1128
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:29,590
Rym: I'm talking about- The Mafia, I was doing really well against the Mafia.

1129
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:30,429
Rym: I was a Freemason.

1130
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:38,990
Rym: One night, we all went to sleep, and when the moderator said, "Mafia, wake up," while I was tapping, I put up a big middle finger.

1131
00:58:40,212 --> 00:58:41,670
Rym: Two of the Mafia started laughing.

1132
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:42,313
Rym: Uh-uh.

1133
00:58:43,798 --> 00:58:44,450
Rym: Is that cheating?

1134
00:58:45,033 --> 00:58:47,510
Scott: No, because the Mafia failed to keep silent.

1135
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:48,849
Scott: Here's what's cheating, right?

1136
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:52,090
Scott: Taking a peek while you're sleeping at night.

1137
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:52,646
Scott: There is.

1138
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:53,450
Scott: That's cheating.

1139
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:58,790
Rym: There is a rule I've used where one person is allowed to peek.

1140
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:12,930
Rym: However, their special role, if the Mafia catch that person, if the Mafia correctly identify, and there's a system for this, who is peeking, then that person immediately dies, and usually there's some other punishment for the civilians.

1141
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:13,830
Scott: Dead people talking.

1142
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:15,970
Rym: Yeah, dead people talking.

1143
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:18,450
Rym: You see, players can ruin the game.

1144
00:59:18,711 --> 00:59:20,010
Scott: For example- That's what I'm saying.

1145
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:20,568
Rym: Yes.

1146
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:21,868
Scott: That's my point.

1147
00:59:22,151 --> 00:59:25,310
Rym: The biggest thing that'll ruin the game is you're killed by the Mafia.

1148
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:25,809
Rym: All right.

1149
00:59:26,291 --> 00:59:28,229
Rym: The next night, you're sitting there at the table.

1150
00:59:29,313 --> 00:59:31,869
Rym: The moderator says, "Mafia, wake up," and you say, "Fuck you, I knew

1151
00:59:31,929 --> 00:59:31,969
Rym: it.".

1152
00:59:33,142 --> 00:59:33,309
Rym: Nope.

1153
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:35,389
Rym: That probably reveals who it was.

1154
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:36,109
Scott: Probably.

1155
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:49,464
Scott: Also, if you have a lot of resources at your disposal, there's a way to play this game that can almost eliminate cheating, which is at night, everyone goes into separate rooms, right?

1156
00:59:50,391 --> 00:59:55,250
Scott: Then, the moderator actually goes around to the Mafia's rooms.

1157
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:56,149
Rym: That's so fun.

1158
00:59:57,156 --> 00:59:57,990
Rym: This is kind of an aside.

1159
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:03,090
Rym: If you are a counselor or something for a high school or middle school trip- Summer camp.

1160
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:09,850
Rym: Yeah, where there's people in a bunch of cabins or rooms, you can run this game between cabins and rooms to great effect.

1161
01:00:11,211 --> 01:00:20,210
Scott: Basically, what you would do is everyone at night would go to their own room individually, so nobody would be able to see what's going on at night, period, no cheating, right?

1162
01:00:20,751 --> 01:00:25,769
Scott: Everyone would go away to the same room and come back to the same shared space all the time, so there would be no way to tell.

1163
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:28,090
Rym: Now, in a summer camp, you got to play this every night.

1164
01:00:28,671 --> 01:00:30,870
Rym: Every morning, you get all the kids together.

1165
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:36,830
Scott: But the moderator would go to each Mafia's room to get their vote one at a time.

1166
01:00:37,891 --> 01:00:44,870
Scott: Since you don't know what's going on out there, and then at the end, the moderator would go to each room and say, "Okay, it's morning," and wake everyone up one at a time.

1167
01:00:45,861 --> 01:00:46,029
Rym: Yup.

1168
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:46,750
Scott: Anyway.

1169
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:54,123
Rym: But anyway, so the game, you cannot give anyone at the table a pen and paper and leave to use it.

1170
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:59,390
Rym: If you give anyone pen and paper at the table, the civilians are pretty much going to win.

1171
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:06,670
Rym: And in fact, what's funny is I was skimming the Wikipedia article on this, and someone in the Wikipedia article said basically the same thing.

1172
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:07,097
Scott: Yup.

1173
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:11,550
Rym: So there is an advanced way to play that I do want to talk about.

1174
01:01:12,093 --> 01:01:12,749
Scott: The real way.

1175
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:15,430
Scott: That we haven't actually played, but we know it's the real way.

1176
01:01:15,953 --> 01:01:18,710
Rym: I played once or twice at RIT with these rules.

1177
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:19,809
Scott: I realized I never did my news.

1178
01:01:20,471 --> 01:01:20,989
Rym: Oh, oh well.

1179
01:01:21,171 --> 01:01:21,630
Scott: That's whatever.

1180
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:22,079
Rym: Save it.

1181
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:37,290
Rym: So the way you do that is the Mafia, it's better to run it this way if the game is all strangers because with all strangers, there's a lot less psychology to take advantage of, so the game will often be very boring until people start to get to know each other.

1182
01:01:38,011 --> 01:01:39,470
Rym: So the Mafia wake up individually.

1183
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:42,049
Rym: They only wake up together once to see who each other are.

1184
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:44,090
Scott: And then that's at the very beginning of the game.

1185
01:01:44,371 --> 01:01:47,749
Rym: Every night, the moderator does, "Mafia number one, wake up.

1186
01:01:48,451 --> 01:01:49,429
Rym: Who do you want to kill?

1187
01:01:50,252 --> 01:01:50,767
Rym: Go to sleep.

1188
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:53,769
Rym: Mafia number two, wake up.

1189
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:55,566
Rym: Who do you want to

1190
01:01:55,606 --> 01:01:55,849
Rym: kill?".

1191
01:01:56,251 --> 01:02:00,690
Rym: If they do not unanimously agree on a person, nobody dies.

1192
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:05,950
Rym: So they, during the day, have to communicate who to kill in full view of the civilians.

1193
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:06,789
Scott: That's right.

1194
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:08,530
Rym: That makes the game fucking awesome.

1195
01:02:09,758 --> 01:02:11,969
Scott: However... It's only good if everyone is awesome.

1196
01:02:13,334 --> 01:02:19,270
Scott: If the Mafia is lame asses and they suck, they're just going to reveal themselves and get hosed immediately.

1197
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:26,019
Rym: I played this way once at RIT with some people, like JD and other people, and here's how it went.

1198
01:02:27,094 --> 01:02:27,930
Rym: Day starts.

1199
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:39,945
Rym: I was not at the Mafia, so I yelled, and I got everyone to shut up, and I said, "Nobody's allowed to say a motherfucking word every day other than to accuse and murder.

1200
01:02:44,172 --> 01:02:44,376
Rym: No

1201
01:02:44,457 --> 01:02:45,090
Rym: talking.".

1202
01:02:45,672 --> 01:02:53,650
Rym: Basically, anyone who accused and the vote failed, then we voted to kill that person, assuming they were trying to communicate, and we killed all the Mafia right away.

1203
01:02:54,035 --> 01:02:54,390
Rym: Of course.

1204
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:57,870
Rym: Now, that system could probably break down if there were skilled players.

1205
01:02:57,870 --> 01:03:01,590
Scott: The Mafia would need some winking and some nodding and some shaking, right?

1206
01:03:01,831 --> 01:03:06,510
Scott: But the thing is, you're going to be looking for winking and nodding and shaking and whatnot.

1207
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:12,750
Scott: I might even wink at people and see if they wink back and then accuse them, even though I'm a civilian and I winked, right?

1208
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:14,749
Scott: I was just trying to trap some other Mafia guy.

1209
01:03:15,451 --> 01:03:19,090
Scott: But I guess he knows who's in the Mafia, so maybe that wouldn't work, but who knows?

1210
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:20,810
Rym: I have pulled some shit over the years.

1211
01:03:21,451 --> 01:03:25,710
Rym: Being Mafia, halfway through the game, being like, "Guys, I'm the angel.

1212
01:03:25,991 --> 01:03:26,589
Rym: He's Mafia.

1213
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:27,014
Rym: He's

1214
01:03:27,075 --> 01:03:27,505
Rym: Mafia.".

1215
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:35,030
Rym: Pointing at two real Mafia, getting people to lynch them, everybody trusts me, and then I lead them to death.

1216
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:37,186
Scott: Yeah, because they believed you were the angel, but you know.

1217
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:40,510
Rym: The Mafia guys I did that to were pissed, but it worked.

1218
01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:41,430
Scott: Yeah, who cares?

1219
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:42,809
Scott: Your team wins.

1220
01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:43,649
Scott: Who cares if you die?

1221
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:51,830
Rym: Yeah, the greatest moment, the only reason to run this game is at the end, when the Mafia win, because it's not that often usually the Mafia really win.

1222
01:03:52,451 --> 01:03:57,362
Rym: Usually what I'll do is I'll make everyone sit there, then I'll say, "My Mafia, will you stand up and take a

1223
01:03:57,403 --> 01:03:57,645
Rym: bow?".

1224
01:03:58,090 --> 01:04:02,334
Rym: And everyone who isn't Mafia, who was still alive and didn't know, will simultaneously say,

1225
01:04:02,395 --> 01:04:02,942
Rym: "Motherfucker.".

1226
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:04,829
Rym: Almost without fail.

1227
01:04:05,011 --> 01:04:05,470
Rym: It's brilliant.

1228
01:04:07,953 --> 01:04:13,370
Rym: So, we played this at PAX a shit ton late at night, because late at night, no one was up for the hardcore games anymore.

1229
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:16,328
Scott: I haven't played the game in years, because...

1230
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:18,129
Rym: Yeah, you were sick when we were playing it at PAX.

1231
01:04:18,851 --> 01:04:21,883
Scott: Even if I was there when you were playing at PAX, I really wasn't in the mood to play it.

1232
01:04:22,295 --> 01:04:22,568
Rym: I was.

1233
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:25,170
Scott: I pretty much just want to play serious board games now.

1234
01:04:25,371 --> 01:04:29,325
Rym: I did, but after one in the morning, I couldn't find anyone else to play a serious board game with.

1235
01:04:29,591 --> 01:04:30,710
Scott: Oh, as I was in bed.

1236
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:35,850
Rym: And I was running this for like 14 plus people, but we played until like two or three in the morning on Saturday.

1237
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:38,226
Scott: I couldn't find anyone to play a serious board game with, except these 14 people.

1238
01:04:39,371 --> 01:04:41,450
Rym: So, yeah, none of them would play a serious board game that late.

1239
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:41,910
Scott: They're at PAX.

1240
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:43,088
Scott: They're PAX people.

1241
01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:51,869
Rym: So I go around the corner after the game ends, and I see a similarly large, completely unrelated group playing the branded werewolf version of the game.

1242
01:04:53,651 --> 01:04:55,350
Rym: And these groups did not interact.

1243
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:56,329
Rym: We didn't know we were there.

1244
01:04:56,490 --> 01:04:58,705
Rym: So I was like, "Yeah, we were just playing that around the

1245
01:04:58,745 --> 01:04:59,088
Rym: corner.".

1246
01:04:59,715 --> 01:05:00,569
Rym: And we had a fun laugh.

1247
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:02,250
Rym: So I guess I should shit talk.

1248
01:05:03,791 --> 01:05:05,410
Rym: So people wanted me to run the game.

1249
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:12,570
Rym: I didn't have a deck of cards on me, and I've learned that people just fucking suck and won't remember what the jack of diamonds is or whatever.

1250
01:05:13,314 --> 01:05:14,189
Rym: So, you know what I did?

1251
01:05:15,332 --> 01:05:16,989
Rym: I took Rose Bonanza's set.

1252
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:18,270
Scott: That's cards.

1253
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:18,538
Scott: Yeah.

1254
01:05:18,811 --> 01:05:24,369
Rym: And I flipped through the cards, and I pulled out the beans that the pictures fit best, and I ran it with that.

1255
01:05:25,252 --> 01:05:27,650
Rym: But it didn't work at first, because people...

1256
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:28,769
Scott: Couldn't remember?

1257
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,710
Rym: People couldn't remember that the angel was the soybean whatever.

1258
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:37,249
Rym: So then I reshuffled it, and I just used the proper nouns from the bean cards, and...

1259
01:05:38,115 --> 01:05:39,589
Scott: So wax beans, wake up.

1260
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:45,130
Rym: Yeah, so the stink bean mafia was born, and people got into that shit.

1261
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:46,309
Scott: Oh, that's a good style.

1262
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:47,709
Rym: My stink bean mafia.

1263
01:05:48,196 --> 01:05:49,230
Rym: What are you doing today?

1264
01:05:50,036 --> 01:05:50,730
Rym: It was brilliant.

1265
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:52,306
Scott: Way to style it.

1266
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:53,980
Scott: Because it's really a game.

1267
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,070
Scott: you can put any theme on.

1268
01:05:55,831 --> 01:05:59,430
Scott: Any group where one group is trying to kill the other group.

1269
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:03,550
Scott: Van Pils, outer space aliens.

1270
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:04,950
Scott: You can put zombies.

1271
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:07,429
Scott: You can put any theme on this thing, and it works the same way.

1272
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:10,970
Rym: So what I'm going to do is I'm going to publish this for free.

1273
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:14,170
Rym: Maybe I'll sell for a nickel if people want a nice printed laminated version.

1274
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:15,105
Scott: I think you just got to make a PDF.

1275
01:06:15,651 --> 01:06:18,350
Rym: Yeah, I'm going to make a PDF, but I'm probably going to print a thousand or two.

1276
01:06:19,135 --> 01:06:20,070
Rym: Give it to people who want a physical one.

1277
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:21,168
Scott: You have the real acrobat, right?

1278
01:06:22,097 --> 01:06:22,528
Rym: Uh, yeah.

1279
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:22,870
Rym: Yeah.

1280
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:30,470
Rym: But basically, I'm going to write good motherfucking rules to this kind of game, because all the rules out there suck.

1281
01:06:32,192 --> 01:06:40,289
Rym: And I'm going to just tell you, I'm going to make it to use with Bonanza, and I'm going to print it so that it'll fit in a Bonanza box.

1282
01:06:40,831 --> 01:06:47,790
Rym: So for free, if you own Bonanza and you want to play Mafia, just take my free PDF and keep it in your Bonanza box.

1283
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:51,250
Scott: And you should also include a note like, "If you don't own Bonanza, you can buy it here,".

1284
01:06:51,552 --> 01:06:54,149
Scott: or you can just get cards that say this.

1285
01:06:54,690 --> 01:07:03,169
Rym: So what I'm debating doing is getting someone to help me make art and just straight up make cards to go with those rules that are my own.

1286
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:05,669
Scott: Yeah, you have to come with a different theme than Bonanza, though.

1287
01:07:06,073 --> 01:07:06,668
Rym: Uh, no.

1288
01:07:06,912 --> 01:07:07,810
Rym: I can use Bean Town.

1289
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:12,329
Scott: Yeah, but you're not allowed, you know, I mean- I'm not going to use- Bean Town, like, trademarked or whatever?

1290
01:07:12,450 --> 01:07:18,394
Rym: No, so if there's no game that I can find, I got to do a little more trademark digging called Bean Town.

1291
01:07:19,257 --> 01:07:19,799
Rym: that has been-.

1292
01:07:20,241 --> 01:07:25,730
Rym: BoardGameBeak has no game called Bean Town, and I dug around a little more and I didn't find anything that was related.

1293
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:27,329
Rym: I found like eight games called Mafia.

1294
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:30,209
Rym: Most of them were not the Mafia we're talking about.

1295
01:07:31,091 --> 01:07:33,229
Rym: Most of them were roll your dice, move your mice kinds of games.

1296
01:07:34,491 --> 01:07:43,744
Scott: But I think I'm going to make my- Mexican Jumping Bean Game, Jelly Bean Jumble, Beanum, Bean.

1297
01:07:43,804 --> 01:07:46,950
Scott: Great Outdoor Sporting Trivia, Beanopoly, Bean Bag Toss.

1298
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:48,009
Scott: Ooh, Bean Bag Toss.

1299
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:49,250
Scott: Yeah, remember that game?

1300
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:50,970
Scott: That's that thing that you buy at the drugstore.

1301
01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:58,310
Scott: High Bond Bundleum 12 Ermitags, Space Beans, don't spill the beans.

1302
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:02,647
Rym: So my thinking is, I'm just going to do it for the hell of it because it won't cost me much.

1303
01:08:03,111 --> 01:08:06,630
Rym: I looked into printing like a small deck of custom cards in a case.

1304
01:08:07,493 --> 01:08:08,689
Rym: It is not expensive.

1305
01:08:09,354 --> 01:08:09,481
Scott: No.

1306
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:10,949
Scott: Get them from China.

1307
01:08:11,673 --> 01:08:11,764
Rym: Yeah.

1308
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:16,210
Scott: On some poisonous ink cards made in a factory by small children.

1309
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:22,850
Rym: All I need to do really is I need someone to make some bean themed art and I'm going for it because whatever.

1310
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:24,770
Scott: Why don't you get a different theme besides beans?

1311
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:27,210
Rym: Well because I want to cross market.

1312
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:33,669
Rym: Yeah, no one likes the bean theme in this house, but everyone I've talked to in person like at PAX, I was like, "Hey, if I just made this, would you buy

1313
01:08:33,689 --> 01:08:33,729
Rym: it?".

1314
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:34,528
Rym: They were like, "Shit, yes.

1315
01:08:34,752 --> 01:08:35,365
Rym: Oh my God,

1316
01:08:35,447 --> 01:08:35,569
Rym: beans.".

1317
01:08:35,932 --> 01:08:39,830
Scott: You should come up with a different theme besides beans, a new theme that no one has used already.

1318
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:40,689
Rym: But see, here's my thinking.

1319
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:45,009
Rym: I'm going to give away this free PDF of, "Hey, you want to play this game and you already own Bonanza?

1320
01:08:45,131 --> 01:08:45,536
Rym: Check it out,

1321
01:08:45,576 --> 01:08:45,981
Rym: beans.".

1322
01:08:46,711 --> 01:08:47,830
Scott: You should make a giant robot.

1323
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:49,349
Scott: There's not a lot of giant robot games.

1324
01:08:51,832 --> 01:08:54,910
Rym: I just want to make it mostly to see how these cards actually look.

1325
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:55,509
Scott: Or make a furry theme.

1326
01:08:56,109 --> 01:08:56,367
Rym: Furry?

1327
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:56,884
Scott: Yeah.

1328
01:08:57,255 --> 01:08:57,447
Scott: Really?

1329
01:08:57,751 --> 01:08:58,287
Scott: People like that.

1330
01:08:58,729 --> 01:08:58,875
Rym: Yeah, no.

1331
01:08:59,953 --> 01:09:01,488
Rym: I want the theme to be derpy.

1332
01:09:01,569 --> 01:09:02,149
Scott: The main game sells.

1333
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:03,429
Scott: Why wouldn't the furry game sell?

1334
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:05,029
Scott: There's not a lot of furry games out there.

1335
01:09:05,029 --> 01:09:05,828
Rym: The main game sells that well.

1336
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:08,010
Scott: And don't make it furry like hot animals.

1337
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:08,948
Scott: Make it cute animals.

1338
01:09:09,430 --> 01:09:10,448
Scott: Like Damaka Debutsu style.

1339
01:09:11,229 --> 01:09:12,090
Rym: Is that really furry?

1340
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:15,010
Rym: Because it's only furry if you're filled with internet butthurt.

1341
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:16,410
Scott: Come on, come on.

1342
01:09:16,470 --> 01:09:17,189
Scott: How cool would that be?

1343
01:09:18,113 --> 01:09:20,370
Scott: Like, you know, frigging snakes.

1344
01:09:20,770 --> 01:09:21,245
Scott: Wake up.

1345
01:09:21,671 --> 01:09:23,849
Scott: See, the thing is- The rhinoceros.

1346
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:25,506
Scott: Who do you want to trample tonight?

1347
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:34,350
Rym: But Scott, what I don't want to lose is the stink bean mafia because people got so... I don't think you understand how into that people got by the end of the night.

1348
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:37,270
Scott: Come up with something else equally good that people would get into.

1349
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:37,929
Scott: I'll do beans.

1350
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:38,889
Scott: Badger mafia.

1351
01:09:39,252 --> 01:09:39,889
Rym: Wake up.

1352
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:40,506
Scott: I'll tell you what.

1353
01:09:40,693 --> 01:09:41,189
Scott: Honey badger mafia.

1354
01:09:41,189 --> 01:09:41,849
Rym: I'll tell you what.

1355
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:47,188
Rym: If you will pay for half the cost of printing this shit, I will let you help me change the theme.

1356
01:09:48,013 --> 01:09:48,269
Scott: Animals.

1357
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:49,209
Rym: You gonna pay?

1358
01:09:50,017 --> 01:09:50,207
Scott: No.

1359
01:09:51,232 --> 01:09:51,404
Rym: Well.

1360
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:51,916
Rym: Well.

1361
01:09:52,532 --> 01:09:53,269
Rym: No creative control.

1362
01:09:54,359 --> 01:09:54,547
Scott: Fine.

1363
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:55,609
Scott: Make your shitty beans.

1364
01:09:56,072 --> 01:09:56,730
Scott: Animals are better.

1365
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:58,770
Rym: The more... Why don't you make your own mafia game?

1366
01:09:59,052 --> 01:09:59,830
Rym: We'll both sell mafia.

1367
01:10:00,411 --> 01:10:03,550
Scott: I'll just take your game with your creative commons license and change to animals.

1368
01:10:03,973 --> 01:10:06,150
Rym: You're assuming I'm gonna creative commons license my rules.

1369
01:10:06,330 --> 01:10:06,989
Scott: Why would you not?

1370
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:08,047
Rym: Maybe I won't.

1371
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:08,586
Scott: Asshole.

1372
01:10:10,354 --> 01:10:12,130
Rym: I might just public domain it and go crazy.

1373
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:14,570
Scott: Oh, then I'll change all your beans to animals.

1374
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:17,750
Scott: Yeah, I think honey badger mafia is the bad guys.

1375
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:30,110
Rym: The thing is, that stuff aside, my only real goal here is that the stuff that's missing from when people try to make this game a game is that they don't consider the real game theory of the balance.

1376
01:10:30,711 --> 01:10:31,108
Scott: Of course not.

1377
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:37,910
Rym: I have a rubric for four players, five players, six players, seven players, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, all the way up to like thirty.

1378
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:42,110
Rym: And I'm gonna have a script, like a straight up.

1379
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:46,130
Rym: If you're the moderator, you say this every time.

1380
01:10:46,611 --> 01:10:47,768
Rym: You only say this.

1381
01:10:48,192 --> 01:10:49,570
Rym: Like this whole script.

1382
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:50,690
Rym: Like a special card.

1383
01:10:51,070 --> 01:10:52,229
Rym: Cause we know how to write instructions.

1384
01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:55,509
Scott: May, will, shall, must.

1385
01:10:56,793 --> 01:10:57,549
Scott: Those are the words.

1386
01:10:57,931 --> 01:11:04,070
Rym: But all that aside, this is a stupidly fun game to play with your friends.

1387
01:11:04,571 --> 01:11:06,590
Scott: But it can get played out if you play it too much.

1388
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:09,369
Rym: Yeah, but it didn't get played out for me.

1389
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:09,930
Scott: Ever.

1390
01:11:10,190 --> 01:11:10,768
Scott: It's played out for me.

1391
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:12,530
Rym: Yeah, but Scott gets played out by everything.

1392
01:11:12,610 --> 01:11:14,549
Rym: Also, he's kind of butthurt cause no one will play brass with him.

1393
01:11:15,212 --> 01:11:15,890
Scott: I played brass.

1394
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:16,589
Scott: It was a good game.

1395
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:18,789
Rym: Yeah, but no one will play it with you again.

1396
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:19,567
Rym: Right now.

1397
01:11:20,111 --> 01:11:21,429
Scott: Why would anyone play it right now?

1398
01:11:21,711 --> 01:11:23,130
Rym: So we got our board game night tomorrow.

1399
01:11:23,792 --> 01:11:24,490
Scott: Oh, we could play it tomorrow.

1400
01:11:24,991 --> 01:11:26,129
Rym: Yeah, but how are we gonna play it?

1401
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:27,630
Rym: Ten people will probably show up.

1402
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:29,530
Scott: It's only three or four players.

1403
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:31,589
Rym: So what if five people show up?

1404
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:32,649
Scott: We'll play something else.

1405
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:33,060
Rym: Yeah.

1406
01:11:33,411 --> 01:11:34,528
Rym: What if twelve people show up?

1407
01:11:35,330 --> 01:11:36,669
Scott: We'll play more than one game.

1408
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:37,204
Rym: Will we?

1409
01:11:37,857 --> 01:11:38,029
Rym: Yes.

1410
01:11:38,375 --> 01:11:38,647
Rym: We'll see.

1411
01:11:39,912 --> 01:11:41,430
Rym: It is hard to get a good hardcore board game.

1412
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:42,109
Rym: Though we got nerdy.

1413
01:11:42,310 --> 01:11:44,070
Rym: Scott, bring it to board game night on Friday.

1414
01:11:44,230 --> 01:11:47,490
Scott: It takes too long for board game night and it's too hardcore for board game night.

1415
01:11:48,093 --> 01:11:48,909
Scott: But I could try it.

1416
01:11:49,131 --> 01:11:50,550
Rym: We could play hardcore at board game night.

1417
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:52,470
Scott: I have seen other people play it at board game night.

1418
01:11:52,610 --> 01:11:55,390
Rym: If we are selective, let's try to get people who've already played it to play with us.

1419
01:11:55,471 --> 01:11:55,770
Rym: Maybe.

1420
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:56,076
Rym: Yeah.

1421
01:11:56,631 --> 01:11:57,328
Scott: You haven't played it though.

1422
01:11:57,572 --> 01:11:57,726
Scott: I know.

1423
01:11:58,516 --> 01:11:59,509
Rym: I learned games so quick.

1424
01:12:00,314 --> 01:12:01,089
Scott: It's a little tricky.

1425
01:12:02,511 --> 01:12:03,630
Rym: Buy cotton right away.

1426
01:12:04,690 --> 01:12:05,849
Scott: That's the first step.

1427
01:12:07,452 --> 01:12:07,847
Rym: All the cotton.

1428
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:09,148
Scott: Good luck after that.

1429
01:12:10,334 --> 01:12:11,429
Rym: I'll at least get that far.

1430
01:12:11,830 --> 01:12:14,570
Rym: And I swear to God, I never lie in this game.

1431
01:12:14,911 --> 01:12:16,229
Rym: I am not a member of the mafia.

1432
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:18,029
Rym: If you kill me, you'll regret it so much.

1433
01:12:19,331 --> 01:12:24,039
Rym: I've said that exact line with a straight face probably four or five hundred times in my life.

1434
01:12:24,210 --> 01:12:24,709
Rym: And you know what?

1435
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:26,788
Rym: It's only true about a quarter of the time.

1436
01:12:27,190 --> 01:12:27,648
Scott: That's right.

1437
01:12:28,230 --> 01:12:29,809
Scott: I say the same thing every single game.

1438
01:12:30,491 --> 01:12:31,046
Scott: No one will know.

1439
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:38,420
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1440
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:43,540
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando Kay for the logos.

1441
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:48,960
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1442
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,880
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1443
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:56,640
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1444
01:12:56,981 --> 01:13:00,136
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1445
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:04,399
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1446
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:07,580
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
