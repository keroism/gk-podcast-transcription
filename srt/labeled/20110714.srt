1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,947
Rym: It's Thursday, July 14th, 2011.

2
00:00:11,947 --> 00:00:12,408
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,528 --> 00:00:13,069
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:14,492
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,612 --> 00:00:18,420
Rym: After a long hiatus, we are back to talk about fuckin' nothin'.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,618
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,203
Scott: It's all your idea.

8
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,887
Rym: It is my idea, 'cause you know what?

9
00:00:27,968 --> 00:00:28,670
Rym: I had an idea.

10
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:29,231
Scott: It's all you.

11
00:00:29,412 --> 00:00:30,013
Rym: No idea.

12
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:30,535
Scott: It's all you.

13
00:00:30,555 --> 00:00:31,096
Rym: I got nothin'.

14
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:31,979
Scott: That's alright, we got nothin'.

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,146
Rym: We got nothin', we are nothin', we are.

16
00:00:34,527 --> 00:00:35,170
Rym: So yeah, we are.

17
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,574
Scott: Why, and why is it that we have nothing?

18
00:00:36,976 --> 00:00:38,160
Rym: Well, for a number of reasons.

19
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,562
Scott: What is the number one reason?

20
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:54,500
Rym: Number one reason is that, uh, stuff's happenin' in my, as in, you know, Rym's, personal life, involving work and possibly, uh, career changes and such that are a big deal, so I didn't finish reading Foundation.

21
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,702
Rym: You had how long?

22
00:00:56,383 --> 00:00:58,989
Rym: I started reading it a day and a half ago.

23
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:01,214
Scott: How long ago, how long has this been the Book Club book?

24
00:01:01,374 --> 00:01:01,755
Scott: A while.

25
00:01:02,116 --> 00:01:03,980
Scott: How long have you had the book in your possession?

26
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,782
Rym: Uh, a while.

27
00:01:06,403 --> 00:01:07,664
Scott: And how short is the book?

28
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:11,648
Rym: The book's gonna take me about another hour to read.

29
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:22,180
Scott: So, what, how many hours, uh, between when I announced the Book Club book and now, did you spend, say, for example, drawing boxes on your desktop?

30
00:01:23,682 --> 00:01:29,548
Rym: I have not drawn yet one, more than one box on my desktop at a time because of that CollegeHumor video.

31
00:01:29,648 --> 00:01:36,576
Scott: Okay, uh, playing Team Fortress 2, or generally, dickin' around.

32
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:40,400
Rym: I played Team Fortress 2 once in that entire span.

33
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,288
Scott: Alright, how long, how many hours did you spend, quote, "dickin' around"?

34
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,493
Rym: Uh, not so much, actually.

35
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:49,500
Rym: So, actually, I've been workin' on stuff.

36
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,601
Rym: Uh-huh.

37
00:01:50,822 --> 00:01:58,380
Rym: Because, you know, we're, we're doin' our, you know, PAX stuff is comin' up, so I've been editing together the other two panels we did at PAX East last year to get them online.

38
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:06,858
Rym: So, rather than duplicating panels, as we always have every year, where if you go to PAX Prime, you basically see the old stuff now from PAX East.

39
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:07,499
Rym: We're gonna mix it up.

40
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:08,781
Rym: Mm-hmm.

41
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:14,780
Rym: But I'm trying to put a lot of the stuff that, you know, PAX people need to see, but they just couldn't get into the room or whatever online, so I'm workin' on that.

42
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:17,789
Rym: I'm workin' on some pony videos that I'd wanna finish now.

43
00:02:18,191 --> 00:02:21,080
Scott: Didn't you say you would do them every Wednesday, but meanwhile, you've missed three Wednesdays.

44
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:26,607
Rym: Oh, not RFE, I gotta, we need to record some new ones before I wanna put up more old ones.

45
00:02:27,027 --> 00:02:27,367
Scott: Uh-huh.

46
00:02:27,668 --> 00:02:28,869
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

47
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:37,880
Rym: Mostly because we recorded them all in one go, so we keep goin' back to the same few, like, I gotta intersperse a different kind of episode in between all those episodes.

48
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,867
Rym: Anyway, plus we recorded that last few kinda hastily at the last second.

49
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:46,351
Rym: And, you know, Connecticut happened.

50
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:52,100
Rym: We're the heads of the panels and workshops department, which meant, you know, the week before the con, I was just dealin' with bullshit every day.

51
00:02:54,403 --> 00:02:54,683
Scott: Mm-hmm.

52
00:02:54,803 --> 00:02:56,347
Scott: Yeah, well, we're back in business now.

53
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:57,008
Rym: Yeah, we're back.

54
00:02:57,048 --> 00:02:58,512
Rym: Returning to our regular schedule.

55
00:02:58,532 --> 00:02:59,794
Rym: We would've done a Tuesday show.

56
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:02,260
Rym: Got a lot of Tuesday stuff to talk about.

57
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:09,740
Rym: But, uh, I had to go do something that, again, is related to careers and money and, and travelin' the world doin' exactly what it is that I wanna be doin'.

58
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,165
Scott: We did a, we did a, we would've done a Monday Wednesday this week, right?

59
00:03:13,205 --> 00:03:23,160
Scott: Because, you know, we, we last did a Tuesday Thursday week, but the problem is, is we've now actually scheduled gaming every other Tuesday and every other Wednesday.

60
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,170
Scott: So, when we're not doing a Wednesday show, we're doing board games, and we're not doing a Tuesday show on Tuesday, we're doing a Burning Wheel.

61
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,631
Scott: Yeah.

62
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:34,339
Scott: So, the thing is, so now, because of that, we can't shift the GeekNights schedule.

63
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:35,080
Scott: It's locked in.

64
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:45,060
Scott: So, like, for example, if we do a Tuesday Thursday week, and we miss the next week, we're gonna do two Tuesday Thursday weeks in a row with a blank week in between and, you know, instead of- Blank, flank.

65
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,860
Scott: Where in the past, we would've switched to Monday Wednesday anyway.

66
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:49,421
Rym: Yep.

67
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:50,523
Rym: So, lots of stuff.

68
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,888
Rym: Also, you know, ever since we scheduled those things, I've just been doin' a lot more.

69
00:03:53,948 --> 00:04:01,020
Rym: I think it's because the sun is out, it's warm, I've been out doin' shit, like, every day.

70
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:01,741
Scott: Yeah.

71
00:04:02,462 --> 00:04:05,807
Rym: It's, I don't know, this is, I think, the busiest summer of my entire life.

72
00:04:06,428 --> 00:04:07,290
Scott: We'll see what happens.

73
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:07,670
Rym: Yeah.

74
00:04:08,371 --> 00:04:13,620
Rym: I've got, I realized I have more things I want to plan that require an entire weekend than there are weekends left of summer already.

75
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,404
Scott: That's why we gotta retire.

76
00:04:15,886 --> 00:04:17,711
Rym: Yeah, we gotta, well, we'll see.

77
00:04:17,731 --> 00:04:20,500
Rym: For this new job thing, we'll see how much money I have in a few years.

78
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:23,387
Scott: So, there's an interesting thing that happened, right?

79
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:26,456
Scott: This dude in Indonesia, right?

80
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:27,680
Scott: Was, uh, he had a camera.

81
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,604
Scott: And he left the camera in the woods.

82
00:04:30,845 --> 00:04:32,388
Scott: Maybe by accident, maybe on purpose.

83
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:33,130
Scott: I don't know.

84
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,372
Scott: He left the camera in the woods.

85
00:04:34,392 --> 00:04:37,700
Scott: And some monkeys came, took the camera, and took photos of themselves.

86
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:38,904
Rym: Oh, good for them.

87
00:04:39,226 --> 00:04:40,394
Scott: And the photos are pretty cute.

88
00:04:40,535 --> 00:04:41,300
Scott: They're pretty cute monkeys.

89
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,690
Scott: Someone noticed that these photos had copyright notices on them, right?

90
00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:49,855
Rym: Well, clearly, these are for the monkeys.

91
00:04:49,996 --> 00:04:51,780
Rym: Because the monkeys took the pictures, they're pictures.

92
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,484
Scott: Right, so there was a discussion over who had the copyright.

93
00:04:55,125 --> 00:05:03,880
Scott: But, the news agency of the journalist who owned the camera sent a message to the site where people were discussing this.

94
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,863
Rym: Right, it was what, TechDirt?

95
00:05:05,365 --> 00:05:05,646
Scott: Yeah.

96
00:05:06,248 --> 00:05:07,853
Scott: And was like, "Hey, take those down.

97
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:08,957
Scott: We own the copyright on

98
00:05:08,977 --> 00:05:09,278
Scott: those.".

99
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:10,822
Rym: Oh, wow.

100
00:05:10,942 --> 00:05:16,255
Rym: Not only that, it looks like TechDirt responded and saying basically, "We don't believe you have

101
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:16,856
Rym: copyright.".

102
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,540
Rym: And now they're refusing to talk to them.

103
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,145
Scott: Yeah, so this is really interesting, right?

104
00:05:21,165 --> 00:05:27,960
Scott: Because it's like, okay, you know, what if I, let's say I was going to make a painting, right?

105
00:05:28,581 --> 00:05:31,266
Scott: And all I did was I took a canvas, right?

106
00:05:31,887 --> 00:05:36,796
Scott: And I took three buckets of paint, and I put them in front of the canvas, right?

107
00:05:37,157 --> 00:05:38,900
Scott: And I put it in like a museum or something.

108
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,034
Scott: So there's three buckets of paint, three paint brushes, and a big empty canvas, and it's an art installation.

109
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:46,100
Scott: And I leave it there, right?

110
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,550
Scott: And then, of course, it's in a museum, and people come in and they start painting.

111
00:05:52,114 --> 00:05:54,640
Scott: Do I own the copyright of the painting?

112
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,587
Scott: Well, in that case, I think it would depend- It's part of my art installation.

113
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:02,620
Rym: Do people have to agree to some sort of terms when they enter the museum or the exhibit?

114
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,180
Rym: I mean, maybe it says, you know, "Anything you do is now art and property of the museum," or something.

115
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,082
Scott: Alright, maybe.

116
00:06:09,342 --> 00:06:16,760
Scott: Now what if I put the buckets of paint, say, I just leave them in a precarious position?

117
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:18,839
Rym: Ah, accidental art.

118
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:29,180
Scott: And some sort of, you know, I do it in California, and I wait for an earthquake, and it's basically set up so that when an earthquake happens, then the art's gonna be made.

119
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,292
Rym: Well, again, it's obvious.

120
00:06:31,352 --> 00:06:32,640
Rym: The mole men get the copyright.

121
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,237
Rym: That's right.

122
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:39,735
Rym: I guess, I mean, accidental art is even separate from all this, because who gets the copyright on accidental art?

123
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,440
Rym: I don't know, and I don't know any lawyers who know.

124
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:50,080
Scott: Yeah, how about that photo that was around the internet yesterday or the day before of the accidental Western scene, you know, that was made by the water splashing up against this pier?

125
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,167
Scott: Yeah.

126
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:51,690
Scott: Yeah.

127
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,649
Rym: Poseidon can have whatever copyright he wants.

128
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,588
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

129
00:06:56,609 --> 00:07:00,155
Scott: Poseidon, I don't- He shows up in court, and he says, "That belongs to me,".

130
00:07:00,236 --> 00:07:01,100
Scott: then yeah, it does.

131
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,240
Rym: You don't fuck with Poseidon, because he's a dick.

132
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,230
Scott: He's my man.

133
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:04,900
Rym: He's the best.

134
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:05,937
Rym: He's the best.

135
00:07:08,202 --> 00:07:08,564
Rym: Or what about?

136
00:07:08,584 --> 00:07:11,220
Rym: there's that College Humor video of the seagull that stole that guy's camera?

137
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,640
Scott: Oh, yeah, right.

138
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,575
Rym: Yeah.

139
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:19,460
Rym: I don't know what the law is about that, but I don't think any human should have the right to copyright to accidental art.

140
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,913
Scott: Now, what if I steal something that belongs to you, right?

141
00:07:25,514 --> 00:07:27,420
Scott: So, I steal your car.

142
00:07:27,742 --> 00:07:28,639
Rym: All right, you steal my car.

143
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,772
Scott: And then I make a sculpture out of the car that I've stolen from you.

144
00:07:32,832 --> 00:07:44,200
Rym: Obviously, I'm guilty of grand theft auto, but besides the point- I believe I get my car back, because whatever you do with stolen property, whoever ends up owning it, if it's determined to be stolen, they're fucked, and you just get it back.

145
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,765
Scott: But it is no longer your car.

146
00:07:46,825 --> 00:07:48,990
Scott: It has been transformed, right?

147
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,540
Scott: So, while you do own the car, your car doesn't even exist anymore.

148
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,335
Scott: It is now a work of art that is a sculpture that intellectually belongs to me.

149
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,660
Scott: I'm still guilty of grand theft auto.

150
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,599
Rym: I think I should get the art.

151
00:08:00,322 --> 00:08:01,080
Scott: You should get the art.

152
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,020
Rym: I think I should get the art.

153
00:08:02,284 --> 00:08:04,034
Rym: Even though- I think I should get the art.

154
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,560
Scott: There are other things that are in the art that weren't yours.

155
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,607
Rym: Where'd he get it?

156
00:08:07,627 --> 00:08:08,597
Rym: Did he steal it from other people?

157
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:10,660
Scott: No, I bought the rest of the parts at Home Depot.

158
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:18,240
Rym: If I were a judge, and I had discretion, I would say- I would transfer the copyright to the guy who owned the most expensive thing that was stolen.

159
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,380
Scott: Yeah, that's just a common sense sort of eye for an eye situation, but I'm just saying, you know.

160
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,609
Rym: Let's use a simpler example.

161
00:08:24,991 --> 00:08:26,159
Rym: I steal your air conditioner.

162
00:08:26,344 --> 00:08:26,600
Rym: All right.

163
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,823
Rym: I take all the copper out of it.

164
00:08:28,144 --> 00:08:28,866
Rym: I melt it down.

165
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:29,949
Rym: I sell it to a guy.

166
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,659
Rym: He then makes a different air conditioner out of it.

167
00:08:34,325 --> 00:08:35,879
Rym: Do you get the air conditioner, or what?

168
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:42,499
Scott: How about you take the copper out of my air conditioner, melt it down, and make a statue out of it.

169
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:42,924
Scott: Ah.

170
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,450
Scott: Make a little mini bust.

171
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,720
Rym: Now, luckily, we have this thing called currency in a modern society.

172
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:56,420
Rym: So I think in all these cases, it comes down to, you get from the person who caused the crime, or committed the crime, money equivalent to what you lost.

173
00:08:57,262 --> 00:08:58,399
Scott: That's an obvious solution.

174
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:58,868
Scott: I know.

175
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,820
Scott: But I'm talking about- So who owns the copyright?

176
00:09:00,921 --> 00:09:11,260
Rym: Yeah, if you're gonna think copyright should exist- I think, well, in the statue case, in the statue case, the guy who made the statue has the copyright on the statue, even though the state's going to take the statue away from him.

177
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:17,580
Scott: Let's pretend it's a perfect world, or some sort of much, you know, copyright is reformed in the way that we nerds would like it to be reformed.

178
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,168
Scott: There's no copyright.

179
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:18,838
Rym: It doesn't matter then.

180
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,099
Scott: Well, you know, but who would you give attribution to?

181
00:09:22,921 --> 00:09:24,220
Rym: Ah, the original artist.

182
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:25,540
Scott: Really?

183
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,016
Scott: Yeah.

184
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:26,380
Scott: With the monkey?

185
00:09:27,744 --> 00:09:30,200
Rym: In this case, I think yeah, because- Or the camera owner.

186
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,060
Rym: Does it come down, did the monkey do it on purpose?

187
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,240
Scott: Because if it's completely accidental, then you should know what- You can't know if a monkey did it on purpose or not.

188
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,684
Rym: Now, here's the same thing.

189
00:09:38,724 --> 00:09:42,417
Rym: What if I set up a camera that's time-lapse, and I just get a time-lapse of a sunset?

190
00:09:42,478 --> 00:09:43,120
Rym: Is that my art?

191
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:50,058
Rym: If I film a completely natural phenomena, I mean, I did the act of filming, our copyright law already covers that.

192
00:09:50,078 --> 00:09:50,700
Rym: that's my work.

193
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,460
Rym: My picture of the sunset is mine, even though the sunset itself is not mine.

194
00:09:55,921 --> 00:09:57,385
Scott: Well, this is the thing, right?

195
00:09:57,405 --> 00:10:02,620
Scott: Remember the case that was pretty recent about the guy who had the album cover that was a pixelated version of a different album cover?

196
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,402
Rym: And it's not like.

197
00:10:03,422 --> 00:10:05,027
Rym: he just put it in Photoshop and ran a filter.

198
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:09,220
Rym: It was a redrawn art that was clear parody of or homage to the original.

199
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:19,540
Scott: Yeah, but it's like, even if he did, it's still, you take one thing, you apply creativity and something else to that thing to create a new work of art, right?

200
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:23,048
Scott: It's a transformative act of, you know, creation.

201
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:27,680
Scott: You took something that existed, you added creativity to it, and then made something new.

202
00:10:28,563 --> 00:10:35,651
Scott: Now, I feel that our copyright law- Yeah, how much the degree of transformation is completely subjective, right?

203
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:39,860
Scott: It's like, I could take a Monet and change one dot on it, right?

204
00:10:40,461 --> 00:10:47,080
Rym: Now, I would argue the best way to define that would be a slightly loose definition that would give the courts more leeway.

205
00:10:47,261 --> 00:10:48,640
Scott: I think the courts do have that leeway.

206
00:10:48,700 --> 00:11:01,557
Rym: Yeah, but I'm saying the definition I would use is something along the lines of, if it could be, to a reasonable person, a full replacement for the original work, then it is not transformative.

207
00:11:01,617 --> 00:11:03,720
Rym: It is, in fact, to be considered the original work.

208
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:11,635
Rym: So if I take, I don't know, Citizen Kane, and I add one pixel to it in the middle, it's still Citizen Kane, and I don't get any rights to that.

209
00:11:12,116 --> 00:11:14,340
Rym: I don't get Citizen Kane and dots.

210
00:11:16,021 --> 00:11:21,160
Rym: But if I change the end, then in the very least, if I make a new ending to Citizen Kane-

211
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:39,060
Scott: But the thing is, Citizen Kane and dot, you might think, okay, it's just a replacement for Citizen Kane, but if you could present it in such a way as to where it would be a really nose stuck up kind of work of art, like, you know, one pixel in this movie has been changed, can you find it?

212
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,516
Scott: You know, it's like, oh, if you presented it in the right way, you could, right?

213
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:48,510
Rym: It's not about what you actually- Ah, but, but, but, but, and here's my down argument.

214
00:11:48,852 --> 00:11:50,940
Rym: What is the stated purpose of copyright?

215
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,760
Scott: For the progress of the useful arts and sciences?

216
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,908
Rym: So our only goal is to ensure that more works are made.

217
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:58,529
Rym: That's our goal.

218
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:00,433
Rym: We want artists to make more works.

219
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,076
Rym: We don't care why or how they make them.

220
00:12:02,517 --> 00:12:03,940
Rym: All we care about is that more art is made.

221
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,392
Scott: Actually, it doesn't say anything about quantity.

222
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,280
Scott: It says progress.

223
00:12:06,823 --> 00:12:09,520
Rym: So we want art to progress in some general fashion.

224
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:11,369
Scott: Yeah, progress doesn't mean more.

225
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,160
Scott: It just means progress.

226
00:12:13,948 --> 00:12:17,580
Scott: Well, you could argue- Does progress mean more and or better or one or the other or both?

227
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,439
Rym: You could argue that it's at least one obvious- According to who?

228
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,220
Rym: One obvious reading of that would be- My progress is another man's deaconess.

229
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,510
Rym: We want painters to continue to make paintings.

230
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,880
Rym: We want scientists to continue to science.

231
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,426
Scott: Maybe we're better off without paintings.

232
00:12:29,446 --> 00:12:30,209
Scott: That would be progress.

233
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:32,440
Scott: Someone might say, someone might say so.

234
00:12:32,901 --> 00:12:37,900
Rym: I know, and I would look at them and I would just kind of laugh and smile and let them go on their merry idiot way.

235
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,494
Scott: I'm just saying, someone might say so.

236
00:12:39,534 --> 00:12:40,080
Scott: It's subjective.

237
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:48,320
Rym: If our only goal is this, generally, we want people to continue to create regardless of the real world incentives.

238
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,624
Rym: We want there to be a system.

239
00:12:49,664 --> 00:12:54,820
Rym: Copyright is there to get people to continue to create and to not just give up, to not just stop.

240
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:04,840
Rym: Because if there was zero copyright or zero patents or anything, then there's no reason to make something if it costs you anything to make it unless it's something you personally want to be made.

241
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:13,600
Scott: Well, there would still be plenty of people making stuff, but there would be some forms of making that would go away or some structures around forms of making that would go away.

242
00:13:14,602 --> 00:13:21,680
Rym: But if this is our goal, one way to fix everything is to enslave all of the artists and scientists and force them to make.

243
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:29,139
Rym: That would, other than violating other amendments, it would violate some amendments to our constitution, that's for sure.

244
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:42,060
Rym: Or we could at least say that a natural work is not subject to copyright because no law will cause the earth to more or less make cool things happen.

245
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,749
Scott: Oh, that is an excellent point.

246
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:44,794
Rym: I'm very proud of that.

247
00:13:44,814 --> 00:13:45,900
Rym: I was thinking about this all day.

248
00:13:46,821 --> 00:13:48,678
Rym: I was looking at that Western scene and I was like...

249
00:13:49,901 --> 00:13:54,000
Scott: Ideally, the idea is you're trying to create an incentive for people to create more work.

250
00:13:54,782 --> 00:13:57,972
Scott: Well, accidental art doesn't need an incentive.

251
00:13:58,073 --> 00:14:00,120
Scott: It will happen no matter what the law is.

252
00:14:00,702 --> 00:14:03,539
Scott: And it won't happen in more or less quantity no matter what the law is.

253
00:14:04,101 --> 00:14:12,500
Scott: So there's no reason to incentivize accidental art, therefore it's actually the greatest benefit to society to put all accidental art in the public domain.

254
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:13,421
Rym: Yes.

255
00:14:13,462 --> 00:14:14,906
Rym: Now the monkeys are a little trickier.

256
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:19,920
Rym: Would the monkeys have made taking pictures of themselves had the guy not put his camera there?

257
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,837
Scott: Well, what if he left the camera there by accident or on purpose?

258
00:14:23,857 --> 00:14:24,340
Scott: Does it matter?

259
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:32,500
Rym: So if he left it there by accident, clearly there is no possible argument that he should get the copyright because it was accidental art.

260
00:14:32,744 --> 00:14:33,680
Rym: He would not have been incentivized.

261
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,480
Scott: But do we need to give people an incentive to leave their cameras in the woods?

262
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,700
Rym: Ah, so what if he left it there on purpose?

263
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:40,334
Scott: And he did it in Indonesia.

264
00:14:40,354 --> 00:14:40,900
Scott: Does that matter?

265
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,664
Rym: Oh, by Indonesia.

266
00:14:43,346 --> 00:14:44,972
Rym: So say he did it on purpose.

267
00:14:44,992 --> 00:14:46,737
Rym: He's like, "I'm going to get these monkeys to take pictures of

268
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:47,159
Rym: themselves.".

269
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,584
Rym: How do we want to incentivize that?

270
00:14:52,684 --> 00:15:00,060
Rym: Because if he doesn't have the right to that copyright, then other people will be less inclined to do similar things.

271
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,740
Rym: And we will lose this precious monkey-driven art resource.

272
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,927
Scott: But at the same time, photography, I read this great article.

273
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,812
Scott: It was about the album cover.

274
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,049
Scott: We said, "Look, photography is really copying.

275
00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:16,994
Scott: You're capturing something that exists.

276
00:15:17,014 --> 00:15:18,558
Scott: You don't make the thing that you took a picture

277
00:15:18,638 --> 00:15:18,678
Scott: of.".

278
00:15:19,923 --> 00:15:23,740
Scott: But there is a significant artistic contribution in the lighting and the framing.

279
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,580
Rym: Anyone who disagrees with that, look at a picture taken by someone who knows what they're doing and then look at my Flickr.

280
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:37,320
Scott: And that is the reason that photography has copyright is because the photographer and also the filmmaker, whoever, puts a significant amount of extra things into it.

281
00:15:39,202 --> 00:15:45,160
Scott: They are taking a copy of the real world, but adding a great deal to it to create an artistic image.

282
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,400
Rym: Having chosen the perspective.

283
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:46,883
Scott: Yes.

284
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:48,799
Scott: Many, many things, right?

285
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,680
Rym: So what if the guy made a special camera designed for monkey shenanigans?

286
00:15:55,107 --> 00:15:56,414
Scott: Oh, see that would get, right?

287
00:15:56,434 --> 00:15:57,359
Scott: But the thing is, he didn't.

288
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:07,220
Scott: So in this case, it's really, he didn't act, even if you want to incentivize people leaving cameras in the woods, the guy didn't put any creativity into it.

289
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,395
Scott: The monkeys put all the creativity into it and work.

290
00:16:10,435 --> 00:16:11,520
Scott: The monkeys were the artists.

291
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,486
Rym: There is already precedent for taking into account intent.

292
00:16:14,527 --> 00:16:20,500
Rym: I mean, look, first degree murder is when you had malice of forethought as opposed to second degree murder, crime of passion.

293
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:27,215
Rym: So we already say you went out intending to kill versus you suddenly decided to kill versus manslaughter of.

294
00:16:27,435 --> 00:16:29,640
Rym: you didn't go out intending to kill, but you ended up killing.

295
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,181
Scott: Yes.

296
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:31,166
Scott: Like he didn't frame the shot.

297
00:16:31,186 --> 00:16:31,990
Scott: He didn't light the shot.

298
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,136
Scott: He didn't do anything.

299
00:16:33,276 --> 00:16:33,900
Scott: The monkeys did it.

300
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,706
Rym: So it's second degree copyright.

301
00:16:36,349 --> 00:16:38,557
Rym: Second degree monkey shot.

302
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:38,919
Rym: I don't know.

303
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:39,240
Rym: Monkeys.

304
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,330
Rym: I keep thinking in my head, I just have that in the loop.

305
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,298
Scott: Let's just not say what that is.

306
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,139
Rym: Let's not say what that is.

307
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,437
Scott: Only cool people will know what that is.

308
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,356
Rym: They're all going to know.

309
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:57,572
Rym: So we could raise a more interesting question.

310
00:16:57,672 --> 00:16:58,396
Scott: It's Thursday, though.

311
00:16:58,717 --> 00:16:59,140
Rym: Monkeys.

312
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:12,200
Rym: You could argue pretty straight up that there are monkeys who are more intelligent on any human, like any standard that we would make, than some number of the human race.

313
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,526
Scott: You want to make monkey citizens?

314
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:14,792
Scott: They're not citizens.

315
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,098
Scott: It doesn't matter how intelligent they are.

316
00:17:16,421 --> 00:17:19,780
Scott: There are dolphins that are more intelligent than children, but they're not citizens.

317
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,119
Rym: I'm not saying they're citizens, but you get copyright even if you're not a citizen.

318
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,044
Scott: No, you don't.

319
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:25,615
Scott: You don't have rights.

320
00:17:25,635 --> 00:17:26,138
Scott: Period.

321
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,887
Rym: So no rights at all?

322
00:17:27,989 --> 00:17:29,077
Rym: Not even basic human rights?

323
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:29,540
Rym: UN Charter?

324
00:17:30,802 --> 00:17:32,120
Scott: No, not if you're an animal.

325
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,772
Rym: No, I didn't say animal.

326
00:17:33,812 --> 00:17:34,480
Rym: I said citizen.

327
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:36,360
Scott: But they're not citizens.

328
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:38,320
Rym: What if you're just a human, but you're not a citizen?

329
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,460
Scott: I was talking about if you're an animal.

330
00:17:42,841 --> 00:17:43,966
Rym: You just kept saying citizen.

331
00:17:44,006 --> 00:17:45,673
Rym: Say I am a British citizen.

332
00:17:45,713 --> 00:17:46,396
Rym: I'm in the US.

333
00:17:46,677 --> 00:17:47,300
Rym: I make a work.

334
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:49,329
Rym: Where's that copyright?

335
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,339
Rym: Do I have a copyright in the US?

336
00:17:52,642 --> 00:17:54,440
Scott: Yeah, because there's international treaties and shit.

337
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,685
Rym: What if I'm a stateless individual?

338
00:17:56,946 --> 00:17:58,009
Rym: That's happened every now and then.

339
00:17:58,029 --> 00:17:59,354
Rym: I have no nation.

340
00:17:59,394 --> 00:17:59,935
Rym: that is my home.

341
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:01,280
Rym: I'm not a citizen of any nation.

342
00:18:01,922 --> 00:18:02,892
Rym: I'm in the United States.

343
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:03,720
Rym: Somehow.

344
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,534
Rym: I make a copyright at work.

345
00:18:06,554 --> 00:18:07,260
Rym: Do I get protection?

346
00:18:07,444 --> 00:18:07,616
Rym: No.

347
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,478
Rym: Are you sure?

348
00:18:08,605 --> 00:18:08,838
Rym: Yeah.

349
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,632
Rym: What if I am robbed?

350
00:18:11,672 --> 00:18:12,456
Rym: Do I have any recourse?

351
00:18:12,496 --> 00:18:13,100
Rym: Can I go to police?

352
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:15,639
Scott: If you're stateless?

353
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,819
Rym: Yeah, if I'm stateless.

354
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,779
Scott: No, if you go to police, they'll just deport you.

355
00:18:19,142 --> 00:18:19,550
Rym: Will they?

356
00:18:19,571 --> 00:18:20,019
Rym: Are you sure?

357
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:20,413
Rym: Yes.

358
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:21,334
Rym: Where to?

359
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,162
Scott: I don't know.

360
00:18:22,263 --> 00:18:23,331
Scott: IMF will figure it out.

361
00:18:23,755 --> 00:18:24,400
Scott: I mean, IMS.

362
00:18:26,901 --> 00:18:28,376
Scott: Not International Monetary Fund.

363
00:18:28,396 --> 00:18:28,679
Scott: Immigration.

364
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,554
Rym: I think you let slip.

365
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:29,880
Rym: Anyway.

366
00:18:31,481 --> 00:18:45,740
Rym: But in the case of the monkey, if they have enough intelligence, I guess it would come down to if we could observe them creating, and we have observed them painting and things, at what point are humans going to be forced to recognize the intelligence of a non-human species?

367
00:18:47,385 --> 00:18:48,098
Scott: When we could talk to them.

368
00:18:49,344 --> 00:18:49,606
Rym: Yeah.

369
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,900
Rym: So when do you think that day will happen and what do you think it'll be?

370
00:18:52,181 --> 00:18:52,779
Scott: It already happened.

371
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:53,366
Rym: When?

372
00:18:53,387 --> 00:18:53,489
Rym: What?

373
00:18:54,081 --> 00:18:54,759
Scott: Sign language monkey.

374
00:18:55,181 --> 00:18:56,047
Rym: Sign language monkey.

375
00:18:56,288 --> 00:18:58,340
Rym: So should that monkey be granted honorary US citizenship?

376
00:18:58,603 --> 00:18:58,939
Scott: I would have.

377
00:18:59,303 --> 00:19:01,600
Rym: Should we stop experimenting on chimpanzees?

378
00:19:06,422 --> 00:19:10,220
Rym: Or should we at least heavily restrict it more so than we do now?

379
00:19:10,641 --> 00:19:11,017
Scott: It depends.

380
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,520
Rym: Because it's kind of like doing brain experiments on babies.

381
00:19:14,763 --> 00:19:15,300
Scott: It depends.

382
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,804
Rym: Yeah, it does depend.

383
00:19:16,904 --> 00:19:17,848
Rym: I don't have easy answers.

384
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:20,537
Rym: Notice how I'm the one asking all the questions and not saying, "Oh,

385
00:19:20,598 --> 00:19:20,798
Rym: well."

386
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:21,565
Rym: Yeah.

387
00:19:21,585 --> 00:19:22,360
Scott: Yeah, all right.

388
00:19:22,601 --> 00:19:24,180
Scott: Should we stop experimenting on chimpanzees?

389
00:19:24,501 --> 00:19:25,560
Rym: I have a complex opinion.

390
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:26,643
Scott: Really?

391
00:19:26,825 --> 00:19:28,360
Rym: That's surprising.

392
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:29,524
Scott: All right.

393
00:19:29,604 --> 00:19:32,140
Scott: Do you have a thing of the day to go with your complex opinions?

394
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,431
Rym: It's not thing of the day time yet.

395
00:19:33,491 --> 00:19:34,340
Rym: I want to talk about Internet Rage.

396
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,380
Scott: How is it not thing of the day time?

397
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,339
Rym: Internet Rage.

398
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,520
Rym: Because Netflix raised- I'll get every motherfucker in this room.

399
00:19:40,342 --> 00:19:46,660
Rym: I love Internet Rage because it's so massive and so furious and yet so impotent.

400
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:54,587
Rym: So Netflix raised its prices from $10 a month to $15.98.

401
00:19:54,587 --> 00:19:54,840
Rym: Shit.

402
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,520
Rym: And the internet went apeshit.

403
00:19:57,845 --> 00:19:58,172
Scott: Mm-hmm.

404
00:19:58,942 --> 00:20:01,258
Scott: Well, it only raised the prices depending on what you get.

405
00:20:02,345 --> 00:20:05,919
Scott: Well, they removed- So they raised them on me because I have unlimited and one disk.

406
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,024
Rym: You know what?

407
00:20:07,044 --> 00:20:08,256
Rym: That's what almost everyone had.

408
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:10,219
Scott: because people- They want you to get rid of the one disk.

409
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,319
Scott: The thing is before- Most of their one disks are scratched.

410
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,100
Rym: Basically, they're trying to, in my opinion, drop the DVD half of their business altogether.

411
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:19,740
Scott: No kidding.

412
00:20:20,203 --> 00:20:21,059
Scott: And that's a great move.

413
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:28,460
Scott: Actually, now that I have Netflix, actually, the DVD part is actually more important than the streaming part.

414
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,839
Rym: Because there's a lot of stuff that isn't in the streaming.

415
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,140
Scott: Right, because the streaming selection is pretty weak sauce once you've watched all the good stuff.

416
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,340
Scott: And only a good new thing comes in pretty rarely.

417
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:46,894
Scott: And the thing is with the DVDs, I'm using those to go through IMDb Top 250, which the vast majority of which is- well, 100% of which is on DVD.

418
00:20:48,366 --> 00:20:48,480
Rym: Yep.

419
00:20:48,862 --> 00:20:51,780
Scott: And a very small percentage of it is on Netflix streaming.

420
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:58,720
Rym: All they have to do is with this price increase, if they just continue to add to the streaming repertoire, I'll be okay with it.

421
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,014
Rym: I mean, the price increase is negligible even to college students.

422
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:10,358
Scott: Yeah, if they use that extra money to get tons of content and the streaming actually becomes so good that I don't need the DVD anymore, I'll eventually cancel the DVD.

423
00:21:11,361 --> 00:21:17,760
Scott: Or if the streaming gets even less quality, I'll probably keep the DVD and get Hulu Plus for at least a short period.

424
00:21:18,122 --> 00:21:21,420
Scott: Because while Hulu Plus, whatever, it has the entire Criterion Collection.

425
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,859
Scott: So I can get it, watch the entire Criterion Collection, and then cancel it.

426
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:25,335
Rym: Yep.

427
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:33,388
Scott: This is something that's like, I think the major problem with a lot of these streaming services right now, is that, you know, they're kind of okay.

428
00:21:33,428 --> 00:21:36,660
Scott: It's like, hey, you pay the low price and you get a whole ton of stuff.

429
00:21:36,901 --> 00:21:38,840
Rym: Ah, but there's too much balkanization of content.

430
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:42,480
Scott: Right, there's too much balkanization of content and you don't want to pay for two at once.

431
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,980
Scott: You don't want to pay for something you're not using.

432
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:54,540
Scott: So you pay for one at a time, you use it until you've pretty much seen all the good stuff that's on there, then you just cancel it and go to a different one, see everything they got, and cancel that, and maybe go back to the first one.

433
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,280
Scott: You know, it's like, keep switching around, moving around, trying different things.

434
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,540
Scott: You don't need to have Hulu Plus and Netflix at the same time for the rest of your life.

435
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,554
Rym: Plus Hulu's not doing so well.

436
00:22:04,081 --> 00:22:09,260
Rym: My guess is that within a year or so, Hulu's going to get bought by someone like Comcast.

437
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,639
Scott: May, who knows what's going to go on there.

438
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:20,620
Rym: My guess is a cable provider will buy Hulu and try to make it only available either for pay or for subscribers to their cable, or some bullshit like that.

439
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:28,920
Scott: I'm hoping that we will see a government bust up that will separate the media and content companies.

440
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,720
Rym: You know, net neutrality would be the first step to that.

441
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,755
Scott: I know, but we need, this is, I think that's going to be, right, how long did it take them to bust?

442
00:22:35,816 --> 00:22:36,960
Scott: AT&T, a couple decades?

443
00:22:37,408 --> 00:22:38,120
Rym: They've been, yeah.

444
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:47,198
Scott: Right, so the media, the media and content, you know, like mergers have only been since like '90, late '90s-ish.

445
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,640
Scott: They haven't been going on for that long, right?

446
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:59,339
Scott: So I'm hoping that, you know, within a decade or two, that will be the next bust up after the, just like the AT&T one.

447
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:05,520
Scott: And basically what will happen is, for example, Time Warner will be forced to break up, right?

448
00:23:05,741 --> 00:23:12,240
Scott: So the internet will have to be a separate company, you know, the Time Warner cable will just have to be cable and that's it.

449
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,137
Scott: Only providing, you know, the infrastructure.

450
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,340
Rym: I'll go one step further, cable infrastructure, internet infrastructure should be a utility.

451
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:29,300
Scott: Yeah, and the TV channels and the newspapers and the magazines and the websites, all those things are going to have to separate and be their own thing, as opposed to all being one thing.

452
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,960
Scott: You know, it's interesting that maybe- And the movie companies all have to separate.

453
00:23:33,141 --> 00:23:37,200
Rym: A decade ago, I would have been fairly indifferent to the sentiment you've just given.

454
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,095
Scott: But the thing is, there's fewer and fewer of these companies each day.

455
00:23:41,115 --> 00:23:42,220
Scott: There's like four of them.

456
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:50,580
Rym: Having worked on Wall Street for almost four years and having learned a lot about business and a lot about corporations, I'm becoming surprisingly anti-corporate.

457
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:51,114
Rym: No.

458
00:23:51,952 --> 00:23:52,079
Scott: Yeah.

459
00:23:53,035 --> 00:23:53,119
Rym: No.

460
00:23:54,826 --> 00:23:55,820
Rym: I mean, shocking, isn't it?

461
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,140
Rym: Shocking.

462
00:23:56,242 --> 00:23:56,640
Rym: Shocking.

463
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,380
Rym: The more you learn about something, the more you become disgusted with the inherent problems in its system.

464
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,210
Scott: See, no one has a job, but JP Morgan profits went up to $5.4 billion a quarter.

465
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,393
Scott: That's over $20 billion a year.

466
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:18,539
Scott: Gee, man, we really need to cut their taxes because, you know, they just need more money because the reason they're not hiring people and creating jobs is because they don't have enough money just sitting around.

467
00:24:19,221 --> 00:24:20,949
Rym: Except that's the Republican argument, right?

468
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,400
Rym: Oh, if we raise taxes, people won't make new jobs.

469
00:24:23,841 --> 00:24:28,800
Rym: But the taxes they're talking about raising are income taxes on people, not corporations.

470
00:24:29,281 --> 00:24:29,622
Scott: Right.

471
00:24:29,742 --> 00:24:32,508
Scott: Companies, if the companies wanted to hire people, they could.

472
00:24:32,528 --> 00:24:34,092
Scott: They have sitting on tons of cash.

473
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:37,660
Scott: What we need is some sort of incentive to make them spend the cash.

474
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,919
Scott: Like, spend the cash or we'll just tax it from you.

475
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,650
Scott: See, that's what we should do is you should raise their taxes if they don't use it to hire people.

476
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:49,015
Scott: If they use it to hire people, then that's okay.

477
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:51,120
Scott: Let them, don't tax that money they use to hire people.

478
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,726
Scott: Get rid of the payroll tax.

479
00:24:52,967 --> 00:24:54,875
Scott: Just have capital gains tax instead.

480
00:24:55,196 --> 00:24:56,020
Scott: Less payroll tax.

481
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,420
Scott: That way if you want to hire people, you get your money's worth if you're a company.

482
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,400
Rym: I paid capital gains taxes last year.

483
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:01,740
Scott: Right.

484
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:08,440
Scott: But if you're a company sitting on a pile of cash, then that actually hurts you because the government will just take that cash away if you don't start using it.

485
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,754
Scott: Force the companies to use their piles and piles of money because they don't need bigger piles of money.

486
00:25:13,774 --> 00:25:14,617
Scott: They already have them.

487
00:25:15,218 --> 00:25:15,800
Scott: They have plenty.

488
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,026
Scott: Google, Apple, everyone's sitting on a pile of cash they're not using.

489
00:25:19,407 --> 00:25:24,920
Scott: If you lower their taxes, all that will happen is their piles of cash will grow and still continue to not be spent.

490
00:25:25,621 --> 00:25:29,931
Scott: Because they have nothing to spend it on except buying other companies, which doesn't make jobs.

491
00:25:29,991 --> 00:25:33,760
Scott: It reduces jobs because they just, you know, when you merge companies, jobs go away.

492
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,118
Rym: Well, there are the other fundamental problems if there isn't enough work to do in most places and.

493
00:25:38,981 --> 00:25:40,005
Scott: Forget those problems for now.

494
00:25:40,045 --> 00:25:41,431
Scott: This is we just need to get past things.

495
00:25:41,491 --> 00:25:43,017
Scott: We just need to get to like 2020 here.

496
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,760
Rym: The skill gap for the smart people who aren't at the top of the skill boat are effectively at the bottom.

497
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:49,522
Scott: Yeah.

498
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:55,160
Scott: If you, you know, we can make all sorts of rules, for example, just these are just random ideas that may or may not work.

499
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,200
Scott: If a company spends its money on training and education, that's tax free.

500
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:10,840
Scott: If a company spends its money on, you know, give, you know, hires a new employee for a position that did not exist, then, you know, payroll tax exempt on that position for X time.

501
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,440
Rym: Even if I fire all my employees and rehire them with a dot added to the end of all their titles?

502
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,719
Scott: Those are positions that did not exist.

503
00:26:17,441 --> 00:26:17,683
Rym: Yeah.

504
00:26:18,047 --> 00:26:19,560
Scott: I mean, no, but they, they existed.

505
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,747
Rym: No, there's a new position.

506
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:21,533
Rym: Now there's a dot.

507
00:26:21,896 --> 00:26:22,520
Rym: I added a pixel.

508
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,629
Scott: No, your total number of employees has to go up.

509
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,940
Scott: Close all loopholes of stupidity like that.

510
00:26:27,441 --> 00:26:28,620
Rym: There's no way to close all loopholes.

511
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,133
Scott: Yeah, there is a way to close all loopholes.

512
00:26:30,173 --> 00:26:30,820
Scott: You know what it's called?

513
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,506
Rym: What's it called?

514
00:26:31,911 --> 00:26:32,580
Scott: Scott's the judge.

515
00:26:33,806 --> 00:26:34,719
Rym: Ah, we know that works out.

516
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,242
Rym: It does.

517
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,675
Scott: You come into the court and Scott says, aha, I see you used a clever loophole.

518
00:26:38,695 --> 00:26:39,880
Scott: I am Judge Scott.

519
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,880
Scott: Ah, you guessed technically by the reading of this law, everything you did is completely within the word of the law.

520
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,262
Scott: But you know what?

521
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:48,054
Scott: I'm common sense Judge Scott and I fuck you.

522
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:48,797
Scott: That's right.

523
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:49,360
Scott: You lose.

524
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,123
Rym: Fuck, right?

525
00:26:50,385 --> 00:26:50,727
Rym: Fucking.

526
00:26:50,767 --> 00:26:52,015
Rym: That's your, that's your only punishment?

527
00:26:52,035 --> 00:26:52,780
Rym: You gonna fuck people?

528
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:55,760
Scott: Well, you know, not metaphorically.

529
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:58,900
Scott: [Laughing].

530
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,097
Rym: So things of the day.

531
00:27:11,117 --> 00:27:13,707
Rym: We had ConnectiCon, you know, awesome con.

532
00:27:13,747 --> 00:27:14,530
Rym: Things went really well.

533
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,454
Rym: All our panelists showed up.

534
00:27:15,474 --> 00:27:15,835
Rym: We had what?

535
00:27:16,077 --> 00:27:19,170
Rym: We had over 170 panels, workshops, and all that stuff scheduled.

536
00:27:19,991 --> 00:27:26,570
Rym: And a good friend of ours in the forum ran a panel on video game music and he showed me a video.

537
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,882
Scott: Did you leave that CD-ROM CD in the car?

538
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,167
Scott: No, I have that CD.

539
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,390
Scott: Oh, I thought you left it in the car.

540
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:33,086
Rym: I took it out of the car.

541
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,230
Scott: I was sure you left it in the car.

542
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,009
Rym: I took it out of the car.

543
00:27:35,091 --> 00:27:35,370
Rym: Okay.

544
00:27:35,591 --> 00:27:36,549
Rym: I had it with, it's in my kilt.

545
00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:37,070
Rym: Alright.

546
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:37,613
Rym: That I wore.

547
00:27:37,693 --> 00:27:44,490
Rym: Anyway, he showed me a video because I was- I was entertaining a crowd before a panel for guests because the guests were running late.

548
00:27:44,992 --> 00:27:47,101
Rym: And I was like, "Alright, I'll show you some internet

549
00:27:47,161 --> 00:27:47,402
Rym: shit.".

550
00:27:47,462 --> 00:27:48,708
Rym: And he was like, "I got internet

551
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:48,969
Rym: shit.".

552
00:27:49,391 --> 00:27:51,129
Rym: And showed me some internet shit I'd never seen.

553
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,584
Rym: The Goldfish, pretty good band, is a music video.

554
00:27:54,825 --> 00:27:55,810
Rym: Pretty good music video.

555
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:01,126
Rym: Music video is homage to everything you listeners like and it's pretty great.

556
00:28:01,186 --> 00:28:02,350
Rym: and it's all about the jazz police.

557
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,070
Scott: Yeah, the song is, okay song.

558
00:28:04,091 --> 00:28:04,589
Rym: I like the song.

559
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,154
Rym: Good song.

560
00:28:05,396 --> 00:28:07,210
Scott: Not a song that would get in your head.

561
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:11,650
Rym: No, but it's a good like, if I'm cruising down the road, like I'd like to listen to this in the background while I'm cruising.

562
00:28:11,831 --> 00:28:12,294
Scott: Okay, song.

563
00:28:12,395 --> 00:28:14,348
Scott: But the video, excellente.

564
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,310
Rym: Jazz police, I just love.

565
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,887
Scott: I like jazz, I like anything called jazz police.

566
00:28:17,907 --> 00:28:18,110
Scott: Alright.

567
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,734
Scott: So here is the thing of the day.

568
00:28:19,754 --> 00:28:25,110
Scott: You know, I'm gonna be honest, it's not the greatest thing in the world, but it has special powers.

569
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,357
Scott: You see, a while ago, I noticed, right?

570
00:28:28,437 --> 00:28:35,229
Scott: I just noticed that the Nyan Cat, I don't think I need to do the Nyan Cat, has the exact same bassline- It's in all your heads right now.

571
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:35,711
Scott: Of course.

572
00:28:36,013 --> 00:28:40,850
Scott: Has the exact same bassline as the song "I Want You Back" by the Jackson 5, right?

573
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:45,550
Scott: You know, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, right?

574
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,925
Scott: Nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan.

575
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:51,990
Scott: And it's nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan.

576
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:52,392
Scott: Right?

577
00:28:52,412 --> 00:28:55,530
Rym: The end of the nyan- That's like the saddest Nyan Cat.

578
00:28:55,671 --> 00:28:57,610
Scott: Right, so the end of the nyan matches up.

579
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:02,310
Scott: If you listen, if you actually were to take a low-pass filter on the Nyan Cat, you would hear that.

580
00:29:02,771 --> 00:29:04,710
Scott: If you listen closely, you can hear it without the pass filter.

581
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:13,730
Scott: Anyway, so there was a nyan thread that appeared, and people in the forum were going nyan-crazy, even though it's been like a month since nyan happened.

582
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:20,150
Rym: There could be a whole study in the progression of memes, how things kind of like, just eh, eh, eh, eh, like they come and go, they pop up out of nowhere.

583
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:23,968
Scott: It was like it was the original nyan, people don't even remember with the anime girl going back and forth, right?

584
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:29,370
Scott: But the Nyan Cat was a while ago, but there's been a nyan resurgence, a rising nyan tide.

585
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,941
Scott: It went up, it went down, it's going up again.

586
00:29:30,981 --> 00:29:32,150
Scott: In the forum, there's a huge nyan thread.

587
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,656
Rym: Well note, you're seeing the same thing in ponies.

588
00:29:33,676 --> 00:29:37,090
Rym: There was the first like, push, and then it leveled off, like dropped a little bit.

589
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:41,010
Rym: And then there was the second waaave that went all the way through the end of the first season.

590
00:29:41,351 --> 00:29:43,299
Scott: It's waning a little, it's leveling off.

591
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:45,167
Scott: I don't say it's going up or down right now, it's leveled off.

592
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:50,230
Scott: When that season starts, it's gonna be an esplode.

593
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:53,602
Rym: Yeah, ConnectiCon, three pony panels I scheduled.

594
00:29:53,662 --> 00:29:55,550
Rym: I turned away two more pony panels.

595
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,410
Rym: Two of those panels filled up, and the third one was like Friday morning and almost filled.

596
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:04,630
Scott: So anyway, I casually mentioned this discovery of the matching baselines in the nyan thread.

597
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:08,470
Scott: And of course, somebody went ahead and comboed the audio remix.

598
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,169
Rym: The internet will always provide.

599
00:30:10,492 --> 00:30:12,449
Scott: Yep, Cyclops Rock, what's up?

600
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:20,510
Scott: And then, uh, some guy, I guess on YouTube, I don't know, see the thing is their forum names don't match up with their other internet names, right?

601
00:30:21,131 --> 00:30:27,930
Scott: So r3dk9 on YouTube took the, made a video of the Nyan Cat and he gave him a fro.

602
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:38,249
Scott: And he put the song on it, and here we have, you know, a proud front row crew GeekNights meme creation project.

603
00:30:38,289 --> 00:30:38,850
Scott: that has succeeded.

604
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:39,865
Scott: Good for us.

605
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:43,021
Scott: So it's a homemade, it's a homemade thing of the day.

606
00:30:43,082 --> 00:30:44,830
Scott: It's not one of those store bought.

607
00:30:45,531 --> 00:30:58,090
Rym: You know, Scott, I picture in a far future, I just imagine this ad, somebody used to make us like a grandma sitting in a rocking chair and she's like, you know, sometimes you don't want a store bought meme, you want an old fashioned one, home cooked.

608
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:04,244
Scott: Yeah, I got myself a, uh, a pusher robot.

609
00:31:04,525 --> 00:31:06,010
Scott: Be careful with it, it's an antique.

610
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,415
Rym: So metamoment, ConnectiCon is passed.

611
00:31:10,456 --> 00:31:16,830
Rym: If you want to submit panels to ConnectiCon 2011, well, hold your horses, cause, uh, I gotta take a break.

612
00:31:18,151 --> 00:31:22,945
Rym: But I am going to let you in on a secret, not a secret really, but ConnectiCon was a pretty big success.

613
00:31:22,985 --> 00:31:23,607
Rym: We had John St.

614
00:31:23,647 --> 00:31:24,530
Rym: John as a guest.

615
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,601
Rym: We had like, we had a team four star.

616
00:31:26,641 --> 00:31:27,970
Rym: We had a lot of people who were really popular.

617
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,770
Scott: I never heard of team four star until this weekend.

618
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:30,630
Rym: They're really cool guys.

619
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,030
Scott: They were apparently really popular.

620
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:40,730
Rym: They were really cool and really easy to work with, despite the fact that due to a misunderstanding and a miscommunication, I, uh, canceled all their panels a week before the con.

621
00:31:41,512 --> 00:31:44,842
Rym: And I had to reinstate them at con, but, uh, they were cool about it.

622
00:31:44,923 --> 00:31:47,310
Rym: They, they, they did everything that I needed and they, they were awesome.

623
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:51,602
Rym: But, uh, ConnectiCon went pretty well and our department is expanding.

624
00:31:51,642 --> 00:31:54,090
Rym: We're going to have more panel rooms.

625
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,930
Rym: The rooms that we have will be bigger and we will have more workshop rooms.

626
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:13,430
Scott: If you want to come to ConnectiCon and work for us being a slave dog, let us- We need some staff because I- Fill up a sign to let the panelists know when they have five minutes left.

627
00:32:13,591 --> 00:32:17,170
Scott: More importantly- Write, write, fill out a form to, you know, rate the panels and how good they were.

628
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,315
Rym: Here's what you need to do for us.

629
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:21,969
Rym: You need to do for us what the enforcers in the theaters at PAX do for PAX.

630
00:32:22,671 --> 00:32:23,670
Scott: Help them with the technology.

631
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:38,930
Rym: And also what we really need is I can't foist it off on the rest of the front row crew anymore because one, they're doing more and more panels and actual stuff at the con and two, one of the biggest complaints slash requests we got was that people wanted more of our panels.

632
00:32:40,172 --> 00:32:44,150
Rym: We can't do panels when I got to listen to a radio to go deal with disasters all weekend.

633
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,074
Rym: So we need some staff.

634
00:32:46,736 --> 00:32:50,650
Rym: If you would like to be staff for us at ConnectiCon, email us and we can talk.

635
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:53,052
Scott: ConnectiCon 2012.

636
00:32:53,052 --> 00:32:53,728
Scott: That's a year from now.

637
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:54,432
Rym: Yeah.

638
00:32:54,452 --> 00:32:55,347
Rym: Catch the quadle and all that.

639
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:55,739
Rym: Yeah.

640
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:56,688
Rym: End times.

641
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:05,390
Scott: Meanwhile, coming up in just a few weeks, the best convention of all time.

642
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:07,643
Scott: We don't need to say what it is.

643
00:33:07,684 --> 00:33:08,170
Scott: Let's go on.

644
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,794
Rym: Scott, you know what the worst thing is?

645
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,238
Rym: Think back to this moment.

646
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:15,109
Rym: On Sunday, when it's over, you'll think back to this and be like, "God damn, that was

647
00:33:15,149 --> 00:33:15,330
Rym: fast.".

648
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:16,964
Scott: I'll just be like, "Fuck yeah, six months,

649
00:33:17,004 --> 00:33:17,307
Scott: bitches.".

650
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:20,209
Rym: Oh my God, there's going to be another PAX right after PAX.

651
00:33:20,731 --> 00:33:21,764
Scott: Why'd you have to say what it was?

652
00:33:21,824 --> 00:33:22,229
Scott: People know.

653
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:22,829
Rym: They know.

654
00:33:23,071 --> 00:33:23,283
Rym: You say no.

655
00:33:24,331 --> 00:33:25,478
Rym: Luckily, you can't get in.

656
00:33:25,518 --> 00:33:26,001
Rym: It sold out.

657
00:33:26,081 --> 00:33:27,490
Rym: It sold out so long ago, don't even try.

658
00:33:27,793 --> 00:33:27,901
Rym: Is it?

659
00:33:28,994 --> 00:33:31,210
Rym: I will say this, at PAX- Can't you buy like a Sunday pass?

660
00:33:31,774 --> 00:33:32,909
Rym: I think everything is sold out.

661
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:33,548
Scott: Let me check it.

662
00:33:34,052 --> 00:33:35,770
Rym: I'm pretty sure everything is sold out.

663
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,228
Scott: I'm checking it.

664
00:33:36,531 --> 00:33:39,376
Rym: So, we are doing one big panel at PAX.

665
00:33:39,677 --> 00:33:45,909
Rym: We are doing, at noon on Saturday, a brand new panel, well, lecture, titled "Discover the Forgotten

666
00:33:45,969 --> 00:33:46,390
Rym: Masters.".

667
00:33:46,711 --> 00:33:53,150
Rym: It will involve, at one point, me and Scott, playing Outlaw, the Atari game, in front of the entire crowd.

668
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:54,469
Scott: It sold out, sold out, sold out.

669
00:33:54,654 --> 00:33:54,909
Rym: God damn.

670
00:33:55,771 --> 00:34:07,625
Rym: We will also, we're working out the details, it is reasonably likely that we will be, along with a lot of other people you may have heard of, doing how to play sessions in a new workshop room.

671
00:34:07,686 --> 00:34:08,850
Rym: that is an experiment at this year's PAX.

672
00:34:09,072 --> 00:34:11,310
Scott: Are we 100% sure this is actually going to happen as we think it is?

673
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,076
Rym: The workshop room is already set.

674
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:16,369
Rym: I've been talking to Father Fletch, who's the head of that department and all that.

675
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:18,007
Scott: Is he actually a father?

676
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:21,065
Rym: Our involvement and all that stuff is still tentative.

677
00:34:21,085 --> 00:34:21,810
Rym: We're working it all out.

678
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:29,900
Rym: But there's a good chance we and other cool people and some enforcers and everyone will be doing sessions like, "You want to learn how to play Tiger's New Freighties?

679
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,126
Rym: We will teach this entire

680
00:34:31,187 --> 00:34:31,467
Rym: room.".

681
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,628
Scott: And then, "Oh look, there's a lot of copies of Tiger's New

682
00:34:33,648 --> 00:34:33,850
Scott: Freighties.".

683
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:41,989
Scott: There have been many times at PAX where I've taught a game multiple times, or I taught three different people at three separate tables how to play Agricola simultaneously.

684
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,188
Rym: It was pretty amazing to watch.

685
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:50,208
Scott: Right, so, the thing, we were like, "Hey, let's just teach everyone how to play all these games one at a time in a room, and then they can break up and play them very

686
00:34:50,248 --> 00:34:50,469
Scott: easily.".

687
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:53,610
Rym: And it turns out that PAX was already working on this concept.

688
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:54,643
Scott: Uh-huh.

689
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:56,123
Rym: So we'll see how this goes.

690
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:01,590
Rym: Uh, buh-buh-buh-buh, the Book Club book, which we will do a show on outside of the stream.

691
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:04,558
Scott: Yeah, Book Club is no longer a Thursday show.

692
00:35:04,578 --> 00:35:08,650
Scott: It is now its own show, which means we're desperate for more Thursday show ideas.

693
00:35:09,772 --> 00:35:12,030
Scott: If you couldn't tell by the fact that this is a show about nothing.

694
00:35:12,251 --> 00:35:13,630
Rym: Show about stuff.

695
00:35:14,193 --> 00:35:15,090
Scott: Yeah, good job, Rym.

696
00:35:15,212 --> 00:35:15,297
Rym: Yeah!

697
00:35:15,992 --> 00:35:16,118
Rym: Yeah!

698
00:35:16,893 --> 00:35:17,189
Scott: Yeah!

699
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:17,946
Scott: It's all you.

700
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:18,728
Rym: It is all me.

701
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:28,150
Rym: So, we will do, from now on, we're gonna take all the old Book Club books, and we're gonna take- We're gonna hopefully do one Book Club per month, just a show on its own.

702
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:31,829
Scott: It'll appear on who knows what day, sometimes towards the end of the month.

703
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:36,070
Scott: Uh, and maybe, I guess towards the middle of the month, actually, 'cause what's today?

704
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,470
Scott: What, today's like July, what?

705
00:35:37,731 --> 00:35:37,895
Rym: 15th, 14th.

706
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:44,810
Scott: Right, so around the middle of the month, a Book Club episode will just appear every month that won't actually be on any particular day.

707
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,230
Scott: It'll be its own episode.

708
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:54,030
Rym: But one thing I'm gonna do is take the audio that is just about the books out of the old Thursday shows we did on this shit, and put them in that feed.

709
00:35:54,510 --> 00:36:00,650
Rym: So if you want to catch up on the Book Club, do the old Book Clubs, you don't have to wade through us talking about five-year-old news.

710
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:01,301
Scott: Right.

711
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:08,390
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna do some website rearranging now that I'm not busy for a couple weekends.

712
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:12,430
Rym: Yeah, we have to finish that PAX event we're running.

713
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,189
Scott: Yeah, that's it though.

714
00:36:14,846 --> 00:36:14,989
Rym: Yep.

715
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:16,529
Rym: Oh, what else do we got?

716
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:19,150
Rym: Uh, PAX East is coming up in about seven months.

717
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:20,189
Rym: We'll be there.

718
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,350
Scott: MagFest is before then.

719
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,970
Rym: MagFest just launched its new website.

720
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,649
Rym: MagFest has stepped up its game.

721
00:36:25,991 --> 00:36:27,930
Rym: They're in the Gaylord, which is a real hotel.

722
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:31,330
Rym: It probably won't smell like butt like the old one did.

723
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:34,490
Scott: It will be on January 5th through 8th.

724
00:36:34,654 --> 00:36:35,047
Rym: 5th through 8th.

725
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,730
Rym: I'm already booking our travel and everything.

726
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,870
Rym: We are going to be there doing some panels and lectures.

727
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:40,312
Rym: John St.

728
00:36:40,353 --> 00:36:42,410
Rym: John is gonna be a guest, as always.

729
00:36:42,532 --> 00:36:45,310
Scott: MagFest X. Dun dun dun.

730
00:36:46,212 --> 00:36:47,210
Rym: I'm actually pretty excited.

731
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:53,150
Rym: MagFest is like, other than PAX and PEX, it's my third favorite con right now.

732
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,870
Scott: Yeah, we get so much gaming done there.

733
00:36:55,111 --> 00:36:55,650
Rym: Oh my god.

734
00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:01,550
Rym: And for all the problems the con has, it goes really well because it's all people our age just kind of do what they're doing.

735
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,370
Rym: The only problem is that it smelled like a butt.

736
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,810
Scott: I think at this MagFest I've got a plan.

737
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:06,568
Rym: Got a plan?

738
00:37:07,011 --> 00:37:08,550
Scott: One day is gonna be Day of Arcade.

739
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:12,390
Scott: One day is gonna be Day of RPG and one day is gonna be Day of Board.

740
00:37:12,938 --> 00:37:13,689
Rym: There's four days.

741
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:14,929
Scott: Oh, fuck me.

742
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:15,406
Scott: Yeah.

743
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:16,354
Scott: Yeah.

744
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,689
Scott: I forgot MagFest was four days.

745
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,610
Rym: That was perhaps, the fact that it was four days is like what really tossed it for me.

746
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:26,967
Rym: Because I remember we got there Thursday and I stayed up until like 3 a.m.

747
00:37:27,048 --> 00:37:28,629
Rym: Thursday night just playing games.

748
00:37:29,112 --> 00:37:31,225
Rym: And then Friday until 3 a.m.

749
00:37:31,467 --> 00:37:31,909
Rym: and then Saturday.

750
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,130
Scott: This is a hotel con.

751
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:36,330
Rym: Saturday I went to the con in the morning and I felt great and I was like, wait a minute.

752
00:37:37,194 --> 00:37:38,270
Rym: It's only Saturday.

753
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,250
Scott: And this time we'll be in the hotel and not on a shuttle bus.

754
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:41,335
Scott: Yup.

755
00:37:41,652 --> 00:37:42,107
Rym: No shuttle bus.

756
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:43,829
Scott: I wonder what the elevators would be like.

757
00:37:44,031 --> 00:37:44,566
Rym: I don't even care.

758
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,109
Rym: Elevator party.

759
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:47,588
Scott: Elevator party.

760
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,910
Scott: So mister, this show about nothing.

761
00:37:52,252 --> 00:37:53,050
Rym: So what you been up to Scott?

762
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,210
Rym: What you doing?

763
00:37:54,671 --> 00:37:55,229
Scott: Going to work.

764
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:55,579
Rym: Yeah.

765
00:37:55,952 --> 00:37:56,429
Scott: Coming home.

766
00:37:56,611 --> 00:37:56,947
Rym: Coming home.

767
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:57,588
Rym: Riding your bike.

768
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:58,669
Scott: Doing cons.

769
00:37:59,553 --> 00:38:01,770
Scott: Not having time to do laundry or clean my apartment.

770
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:02,370
Rym: My apartment?

771
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,930
Scott: I didn't even have time to push the button on the dishwasher that cleans the dishes.

772
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,530
Rym: You should see the room we're sitting in right now.

773
00:38:07,731 --> 00:38:09,430
Rym: It looks like it has been destroyed.

774
00:38:10,297 --> 00:38:10,950
Scott: It has been destroyed.

775
00:38:11,594 --> 00:38:13,470
Rym: There is stuff piled up everywhere.

776
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:14,730
Rym: It's kind of a disaster.

777
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,762
Scott: You should see the pile of trash in front of my front door.

778
00:38:16,802 --> 00:38:18,529
Scott: that is from boxes that have been destroyed.

779
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:24,228
Rym: I've got like 20 boxes scattered around the living room that need to be broken down and taken down to the recycling area.

780
00:38:26,351 --> 00:38:32,062
Rym: I blame partly that we're doing these game nights and the NerdNYC stuff I'm going to again and cons.

781
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,870
Scott: Yeah, NerdNYC is a new website.

782
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:36,829
Rym: Yeah, NerdNYC is stepping up their game too.

783
00:38:38,454 --> 00:38:40,450
Scott: I think it's the time of game up stepping.

784
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,310
Rym: Huh, maybe we'll be stepping up our game.

785
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:48,170
Rym: Maybe there's a thing in the nearing-ish future that we may be working on.

786
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:48,927
Scott: Hopefully this weekend.

787
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:52,687
Rym: I don't know what you're referring to.

788
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:59,450
Scott: I'm basically going to be, you know, now that I actually have weekends where there's nothing, I'm going to be spending all my weekend time pushing real hard.

789
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,370
Rym: Well, what do we got to push?

790
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:01,069
Rym: We got Turn Flicked.

791
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:01,768
Scott: Yep.

792
00:39:02,271 --> 00:39:10,410
Rym: That's kind of our big, you know, every time we've been interviewed by other press, what they always ask is, "So, you guys are clearly experts on games.

793
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:11,584
Rym: How come you haven't made a

794
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:11,889
Rym: game?".

795
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:16,929
Scott: How come movie critics don't make food and food, I mean, movie critics don't make movies and food critics don't cook?

796
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,889
Rym: Yeah, so we're going to...

797
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:22,450
Scott: You're such a good food critic, why don't you go and open up a five-star restaurant?

798
00:39:22,931 --> 00:39:24,389
Rym: So, we're going to do that.

799
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:27,630
Rym: We're going to be the food critic who opens a one-star restaurant.

800
00:39:27,892 --> 00:39:28,350
Rym: That's right.

801
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:29,527
Rym: It's getting there.

802
00:39:31,234 --> 00:39:32,290
Scott: It's a half-star restaurant right now.

803
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:39,410
Rym: But we're playing some pretty awesome, one pretty awesome, awesome in quotes, "old war game" to learn about old war games.

804
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:39,929
Rym: How old is it?

805
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:40,549
Scott: It's not that old.

806
00:39:41,495 --> 00:39:42,069
Rym: It's old-ish.

807
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,266
Scott: No, it's like 2000-something.

808
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,210
Rym: It got re-released.

809
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:45,208
Scott: Oh, really?

810
00:39:45,331 --> 00:39:46,110
Rym: I think it got re-released.

811
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,070
Rym: I was reading stuff about it.

812
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,070
Scott: Here comes Board Game Geek.

813
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,390
Rym: Ah, you should get the Board Game Geek.

814
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:52,649
Rym: But, aside from Turn Flicked, we got, you know...

815
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:54,430
Scott: Why are you talking about games on non-Tuesday?

816
00:39:54,770 --> 00:40:05,709
Rym: You know, we always say that we want to run conventions better and we complain about conventions that are run poorly and we have a history of stepping up and putting up when people tell us to step up, put up, or shut up.

817
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,310
Rym: Games from 2007.

818
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:07,848
Rym: That's pretty old.

819
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:08,610
Rym: Okay.

820
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,910
Scott: Yeah, that's the re-release.

821
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:12,849
Rym: Yeah, when's the original game?

822
00:40:15,601 --> 00:40:15,888
Rym: Oh, old.

823
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:16,445
Rym: Ancient.

824
00:40:17,471 --> 00:40:19,710
Rym: In 2006, I had just left college.

825
00:40:21,062 --> 00:40:21,190
Rym: Yeah.

826
00:40:21,331 --> 00:40:22,749
Rym: I was working for IBM still, I think.

827
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:23,846
Rym: Yeah?

828
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:24,290
Rym: Yeah.

829
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,899
Rym: But, you know, Otakon doesn't really like us anymore.

830
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:30,487
Rym: They don't want us to come back.

831
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:38,328
Scott: Man, but actually, Otakon busted out their guest announcement at the last minute and I was sort of like, "The only one that really hurts, though...".

832
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:44,889
Scott: I mean, there's a lot of good ones, obviously, but the only one I really wanted to see very badly is Makoto Shinkai.

833
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,889
Scott: Otakon's actually this weekend.

834
00:40:47,452 --> 00:40:50,069
Scott: As in, we are going right now to it.

835
00:40:50,357 --> 00:40:50,709
Scott: Oh my god.

836
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,590
Scott: If we were going to it.

837
00:40:52,956 --> 00:40:53,870
Rym: It does pain me.

838
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,808
Rym: It's been two Otakons we have not gone to.

839
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,010
Rym: And I do miss that ritual.

840
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,770
Rym: It was almost a decade of my life.

841
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,229
Rym: Otakon was like this culmination of the summer.

842
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:04,080
Rym: And, no.

843
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:06,528
Rym: But, Kinetakon said, "Hey, put

844
00:41:06,609 --> 00:41:06,669
Rym: up.".

845
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,050
Rym: And now we're the heads of the department.

846
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,149
Rym: We run all the panels and workshops.

847
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:12,470
Rym: And sometimes people ask us why we don't run our own con.

848
00:41:12,991 --> 00:41:15,068
Rym: And that's one of the things I've been working on.

849
00:41:15,496 --> 00:41:15,728
Scott: Yeah.

850
00:41:16,133 --> 00:41:16,790
Rym: No details.

851
00:41:17,295 --> 00:41:17,728
Rym: No date.

852
00:41:18,332 --> 00:41:28,050
Rym: No, not saying anything other than that there will be, sometime in the nearing-ish future, an announcement that we are going to run a convention in New York City.

853
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:31,590
Scott: It could be a room with some tables and board games for an hour.

854
00:41:32,271 --> 00:41:34,650
Scott: It could be a real convention.

855
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,149
Scott: It's somewhere in between the two.

856
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:50,848
Rym: My goal is to have a one-day convention that has some sort of panel or lecture-ish programming independent of a gaming area, and maybe a small vending area, and maybe 500 people.

857
00:41:52,841 --> 00:41:52,969
Scott: Yep.

858
00:41:53,271 --> 00:41:53,726
Rym: That's my goal.

859
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,810
Scott: In one of the five boroughs of Manhattan.

860
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,450
Rym: Yeah, I can tell you it's not going to be in Staten Island.

861
00:41:59,554 --> 00:42:01,310
Scott: In one of the four real boroughs of Manhattan.

862
00:42:02,557 --> 00:42:03,149
Scott: And not Yonkers.

863
00:42:03,791 --> 00:42:04,570
Rym: Yeah, not Yonkers.

864
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,290
Rym: The sixth borough.

865
00:42:06,251 --> 00:42:07,909
Rym: So, that's coming up along.

866
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:12,950
Rym: Inns, if you're interested in helping, don't bother me yet because the logistics are way ahead of that point.

867
00:42:13,693 --> 00:42:14,508
Rym: Unless you have money.

868
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,810
Rym: If you want to help with money, you're welcome to help with money.

869
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:20,810
Scott: If you want to help with your hands, wait.

870
00:42:21,492 --> 00:42:21,560
Rym: Yep.

871
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:26,550
Rym: If you want to help with being famous and want to be a guest, yeah, you can help then too.

872
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:27,510
Rym: But otherwise, no helping.

873
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:28,865
Scott: Yet.

874
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:34,350
Rym: So, I've been watching, notice how I'm threading this nothing show along, old Netflixes while I do stuff.

875
00:42:34,831 --> 00:42:38,130
Rym: Because I can't watch Fist of the North Star while I'm working on stuff because they're subtitles.

876
00:42:38,632 --> 00:42:42,950
Scott: I know, that is the one problem with subtitles is you can't watch them simultaneously.

877
00:42:44,832 --> 00:42:45,289
Scott: Simultaneously.

878
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:47,089
Scott: You have to give it your full attentions.

879
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:50,830
Rym: So, I've been watching a whole bunch of old kids in the hall.

880
00:42:51,552 --> 00:42:51,890
Scott: Uh huh.

881
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:59,270
Rym: I was ragging on them in the forum a while ago when I said that 80s comedy by and large sucks by today's standards.

882
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:00,569
Scott: Why would you say that?

883
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:03,850
Rym: Name good 80s comedy compared to bad 80s comedy.

884
00:43:04,712 --> 00:43:05,879
Rym: There are huge exceptions.

885
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,288
Rym: George Carlin was hilarious in the 80s.

886
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:08,649
Scott: Did Richard Pryor count?

887
00:43:10,512 --> 00:43:12,730
Rym: What bit are you thinking of and when did he first perform it?

888
00:43:13,231 --> 00:43:14,184
Scott: He's so 70s 80s, it's tough.

889
00:43:15,371 --> 00:43:16,135
Rym: I know, I know.

890
00:43:16,155 --> 00:43:19,087
Rym: Like, Kids in the Hall, a lot of the stuff I liked from them was from the 90s.

891
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:21,469
Rym: And it's all over the place.

892
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:25,990
Rym: But anyway, I said something to the effect of, I don't know how well Kids in the Hall will hold up.

893
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,421
Rym: I think I have to rescind that.

894
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:30,449
Rym: It's holding up pretty well.

895
00:43:32,091 --> 00:43:33,301
Rym: It's funnier than the whitest kids.

896
00:43:33,322 --> 00:43:34,250
Rym: you know who are okay.

897
00:43:35,393 --> 00:43:36,090
Rym: Yeah, alright.

898
00:43:36,297 --> 00:43:36,650
Rym: It's okay.

899
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,308
Rym: I haven't found any new stand-up comedians lately.

900
00:43:42,873 --> 00:43:45,590
Rym: I think Russell Peters is the last new stand-up comedian I know of.

901
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:50,090
Scott: They're mostly like, you know, it seems like people don't really do stand-up so much.

902
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:53,270
Scott: They mostly go, you know, because short internet videos have taken over, right?

903
00:43:53,691 --> 00:43:58,750
Scott: So it's mostly about doing a skit or producing a funny video of some sort.

904
00:43:59,111 --> 00:44:02,350
Scott: Which usually does not involve just standing there telling jokes, right?

905
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:07,870
Scott: I mean, I guess there was that guy who did the terrorist skeleton puppet.

906
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:13,290
Scott: Effectively, it's stand-up, but it's also ventriloquism.

907
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:14,049
Rym: Vaudeville.

908
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:14,657
Scott: Yeah.

909
00:44:17,274 --> 00:44:18,261
Scott: He got pretty popular.

910
00:44:18,302 --> 00:44:19,390
Scott: He's okay, I guess.

911
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:21,255
Rym: Though I did see a good bit of Uncle Yo.

912
00:44:21,275 --> 00:44:24,969
Rym: I was watching the video from Uncle Yo doing his stand-up at ConnectiCon since the room filled up.

913
00:44:26,151 --> 00:44:26,697
Rym: It was pretty funny.

914
00:44:27,385 --> 00:44:27,770
Rym: Pretty funny.

915
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:29,849
Scott: You practiced anything, you'd be good at it.

916
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:31,889
Scott: He practices comedy every day.

917
00:44:34,211 --> 00:44:37,889
Rym: So, I was going to make a joke about Control Alt to leave, but I figure it's too soon.

918
00:44:40,992 --> 00:44:43,509
Scott: No, he's very, very good at what he does.

919
00:44:44,371 --> 00:44:49,970
Rym: Yeah, kind of like how a White Castle burger is extremely excellent at being a White Castle burger.

920
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:54,570
Scott: Yeah, I could work at a White Castle for a very long time, and I would become a master of making a slider.

921
00:44:55,433 --> 00:45:02,156
Scott: I would not become the master of making- Right, exactly.

922
00:45:02,216 --> 00:45:05,670
Scott: But I would not become the master of making the best burger in the world.

923
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,730
Rym: Even though I've made zillions of burgers.

924
00:45:09,113 --> 00:45:09,789
Rym: So, good burger.

925
00:45:10,691 --> 00:45:11,829
Rym: Sweet potato fries now.

926
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:13,430
Scott: Alright, because they're in season.

927
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:14,583
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

928
00:45:14,644 --> 00:45:15,009
Rym: Pretty good.

929
00:45:16,854 --> 00:45:18,450
Scott: Good burger's still a little bit too expensive.

930
00:45:18,971 --> 00:45:19,589
Rym: Yeah, I got money.

931
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,310
Scott: I've been going to Island Burger.

932
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:22,905
Rym: I'm waiting for that Potbelly's to open up.

933
00:45:24,153 --> 00:45:24,527
Rym: Island Burger.

934
00:45:26,875 --> 00:45:28,210
Rym: My co-workers are talking about Island Burger.

935
00:45:29,511 --> 00:45:31,100
Rym: We were talking about good burger joints.

936
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,568
Rym: I was like, "Schnippers, one of the

937
00:45:32,608 --> 00:45:32,789
Rym: best.".

938
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:33,574
Rym: And they were like, "Island

939
00:45:33,594 --> 00:45:33,836
Rym: Burger.".

940
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,787
Rym: And I was like, "Yeah, Island Burger's good, but it's too far

941
00:45:35,828 --> 00:45:36,069
Rym: away.".

942
00:45:36,271 --> 00:45:37,228
Scott: It's very close to me.

943
00:45:37,511 --> 00:45:38,408
Rym: Yeah, not so close to me.

944
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,169
Scott: You should come over.

945
00:45:39,972 --> 00:45:43,850
Rym: I should, but I might be further away starting sometime next week.

946
00:45:44,091 --> 00:45:44,810
Scott: That's not my problem.

947
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:45,511
Scott: Yeah.

948
00:45:45,872 --> 00:45:52,110
Rym: Of course, I'll be close enough to Chinatown to get five dumplings for a dollar instead of five dumplings for five dollars.

949
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:53,270
Scott: There's no Island Burger in Chinatown.

950
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:54,375
Rym: No, there's not.

951
00:45:54,617 --> 00:45:56,330
Rym: There are similar things, though.

952
00:45:56,539 --> 00:45:56,708
Scott: Yeah.

953
00:45:59,012 --> 00:46:00,083
Scott: Yeah, Mr.

954
00:46:00,123 --> 00:46:00,830
Scott: Show About Nothing.

955
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:01,838
Scott: So you got nothing?

956
00:46:01,919 --> 00:46:02,547
Scott: You got nothing?

957
00:46:03,151 --> 00:46:03,728
Scott: This is all you.

958
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:05,030
Rym: You can't just talk about something?

959
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:06,757
Rym: I don't know.

960
00:46:06,777 --> 00:46:08,030
Rym: Does anything happen to you ever?

961
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:10,109
Scott: I bought a solid-state drive.

962
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:13,283
Rym: All right, so at Connecticut, right, John St.

963
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:14,129
Rym: John was a guest.

964
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:19,110
Rym: And he had to do his panel, which was in a tiny-ass room because I messed up the numbers.

965
00:46:19,633 --> 00:46:21,389
Rym: I flopped a big room and a small room.

966
00:46:21,731 --> 00:46:24,770
Rym: So all the stuff I put in the big room ended up being in the small room and vice versa.

967
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:25,490
Rym: Good job.

968
00:46:25,973 --> 00:46:28,529
Rym: Yeah, that was probably my biggest failing ever.

969
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:30,334
Rym: But John St.

970
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:38,990
Rym: John came, I got him into the big room, filled the room anyway, giant crowd, and he forgot his iPad, which he needed to do one of the bits in his panel.

971
00:46:39,731 --> 00:46:41,167
Rym: So he went to get it for, like, 20 minutes.

972
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:44,789
Rym: So I'm standing in the room at the front of the stage.

973
00:46:45,211 --> 00:46:46,462
Rym: It's a Blues Brothers situation.

974
00:46:46,482 --> 00:46:47,370
Rym: You know, everyone's waiting.

975
00:46:48,091 --> 00:46:58,890
Rym: So I had to entertain the crowd for a while, and I realized that the best thing to do in that situation is to tell anecdotes about the person who is about to come back and prime the audience to fuck with them.

976
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:01,379
Scott: That's, we've done that often.

977
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:03,230
Scott: We have a great deal of practice in that department.

978
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:03,885
Scott: So I was like, yeah.

979
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:04,770
Scott: In our Anime Club days.

980
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:06,481
Rym: I was like, you should ask him about some ponies.

981
00:47:06,662 --> 00:47:07,730
Rym: I hear he's a pony fan.

982
00:47:08,972 --> 00:47:10,649
Rym: And people asked him about ponies.

983
00:47:12,834 --> 00:47:14,010
Rym: I think someone posted that in our forum.

984
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:21,110
Scott: There was something, a video on YouTube of him reading, basically he was reading the song of My Little Pony, the lyric, he wasn't singing it.

985
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:23,770
Rym: They asked him to do that, to read it in his voice, and he did.

986
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:24,908
Scott: Yeah, why wouldn't he?

987
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:28,870
Rym: What was weird though, and it's funny because we're like D-level celebrities, me and Scott.

988
00:47:29,591 --> 00:47:29,818
Rym: D minus.

989
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:30,932
Rym: John St.

990
00:47:30,992 --> 00:47:34,130
Rym: John is like, he's a step and a half, two steps above us celebrity-wise.

991
00:47:34,331 --> 00:47:35,448
Rym: He's up there compared to us.

992
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:39,270
Rym: So it's funny that we know each other, we're chill.

993
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:40,389
Rym: We're like, hey dude, hey dude.

994
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:50,189
Rym: If I walked by him in the hall and I was like, yo, and we like fist bump and just walk by, people who are walking with me, like panelists I'm taking to the room, be like, oh my god, you know John St.

995
00:47:50,209 --> 00:47:50,530
Rym: John?

996
00:47:52,234 --> 00:47:53,908
Rym: How do you, oh, oh, oh.

997
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:55,130
Rym: And it was kind of hilarious.

998
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:56,560
Rym: I was digging that, I'll be honest.

999
00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:58,408
Rym: I was eating that up.

1000
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,168
Rym: I was like, no, we cool, we cool.

1001
00:48:00,472 --> 00:48:01,169
Scott: I'm like, whatever.

1002
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:01,683
Scott: Yeah.

1003
00:48:02,351 --> 00:48:06,590
Rym: I always enjoy watching people who haven't learned to deal with celebrities.

1004
00:48:07,191 --> 00:48:09,209
Rym: They don't realize that he's just a guy.

1005
00:48:09,832 --> 00:48:10,469
Rym: We're just guys.

1006
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:12,570
Rym: We have fans that come up to us and don't know what to say.

1007
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:15,470
Rym: They're like, sign my thing, please.

1008
00:48:16,155 --> 00:48:16,886
Scott: I'm like, what are you doing?

1009
00:48:17,831 --> 00:48:19,130
Rym: Granted, you seem to hate our fans.

1010
00:48:19,411 --> 00:48:24,010
Rym: Cute girls come up to us on a regular basis and they're like, we're huge fans of GeekNights, oh my god.

1011
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:25,630
Rym: And Scott's like, what the fuck do you listen to GeekNights for?

1012
00:48:25,731 --> 00:48:27,230
Scott: That's right, why do you listen to GeekNights?

1013
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:28,788
Scott: What the fuck is wrong with you?

1014
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:30,870
Scott: You could do a lot better things than listen to this show.

1015
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,482
Scott: Especially, especially this episode.

1016
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:34,470
Scott: This episode is awful.

1017
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:35,430
Rym: Can I have your autograph?

1018
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:36,969
Rym: And Scott's like, what the fuck?

1019
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:37,574
Scott: Why?

1020
00:48:38,611 --> 00:48:40,210
Rym: Do you want me to scribble on a piece of paper?

1021
00:48:41,436 --> 00:48:43,790
Scott: I don't understand why anyone wants any autograph.

1022
00:48:45,153 --> 00:48:49,670
Scott: Even if the most famous person in the world, I have no interest in having them scribble on a piece of paper.

1023
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:59,150
Rym: I enjoy signing autographs because it's a thing that when other people see you signing an autograph, they wonder who the fuck you are.

1024
00:49:01,693 --> 00:49:03,030
Rym: There's something funny about that.

1025
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:04,890
Scott: I have no interest in collecting anything.

1026
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:11,049
Rym: Remember our first packs when we did that secret panel after our panel?

1027
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:15,387
Rym: And Luke Crane was there and Jared Sorensen was there.

1028
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:20,569
Rym: Some listeners came up to us and they had bought Burning Wheel because they had just played it because we told them to.

1029
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:27,889
Rym: And they asked us to sign the Burning Wheel book when Luke Crane was standing right there.

1030
00:49:28,671 --> 00:49:31,410
Rym: And Luke looks over and I see him looking at me and I'm signing this book.

1031
00:49:31,652 --> 00:49:32,844
Rym: And I just look at his face and I'm like, why?

1032
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:35,847
Rym: What the fuck?

1033
00:49:40,752 --> 00:49:43,370
Scott: But yeah, I don't understand any autographs, period.

1034
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:49,326
Scott: If I meet a famous person that I actually care about, my number one interest is to ask them questions.

1035
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:50,750
Scott: no one else has the balls to ask them.

1036
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:52,128
Scott: That is what I do.

1037
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,809
Rym: So how long is it?

1038
00:49:54,551 --> 00:49:55,829
Scott: Not questions like that.

1039
00:49:56,371 --> 00:49:58,070
Rym: No one else is asking those questions.

1040
00:49:58,693 --> 00:50:01,610
Scott: Questions like, you know, that they probably won't answer.

1041
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:10,290
Rym: So you're famous for many anime, but in particular, when you voice acted as so-and-so on Crystal Triangle.

1042
00:50:10,891 --> 00:50:11,735
Scott: Exactly.

1043
00:50:12,016 --> 00:50:14,710
Scott: That's the sort of angle you go for.

1044
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:17,570
Scott: Ask them about the weird thing that no one else remembers.

1045
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:22,019
Scott: Ask them about, you know, something they did.

1046
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:26,870
Scott: or, you know, ask about inside things that people wouldn't normally know.

1047
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:39,990
Scott: Like, for example, if I could talk to the pony people, I would be like, hey, look, everybody knows, you know, there's sort of like this mystique that there are executives, TV executives who hand down decrees that you must follow.

1048
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:46,030
Scott: And there's a clash between the creative animators who want to go weeee and the executives who say sell toys.

1049
00:50:46,973 --> 00:50:49,130
Scott: But those executives are real people.

1050
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:50,569
Scott: They're human beings.

1051
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:51,826
Scott: Who are they?

1052
00:50:52,793 --> 00:50:54,387
Scott: What do they actually say to you?

1053
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:56,877
Scott: You know, what are these decrees?

1054
00:50:56,937 --> 00:50:58,021
Scott: How do they come down?

1055
00:50:58,081 --> 00:51:00,850
Scott: How does that whole what's the reality of that relationship?

1056
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:01,231
Scott: Right.

1057
00:51:01,252 --> 00:51:02,508
Scott: Nobody nobody asked that.

1058
00:51:03,171 --> 00:51:03,412
Scott: Right.

1059
00:51:04,154 --> 00:51:08,509
Scott: But that's that's the kind of thing that I would ask, you know, is like, I want to know how it really is.

1060
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:10,328
Scott: You know, I want to know the deal.

1061
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:12,449
Scott: No one else tries to find out the deal.

1062
00:51:12,731 --> 00:51:15,810
Scott: They ask stupid questions like, why are you so awesome?

1063
00:51:15,951 --> 00:51:17,650
Scott: How can I become a voice actor?

1064
00:51:18,272 --> 00:51:19,830
Scott: Tell me tell me a funny story.

1065
00:51:20,531 --> 00:51:23,510
Scott: Let me self promote myself and not actually ask a question.

1066
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:25,501
Rym: I was about to say, very rarely do they do.

1067
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:27,110
Rym: they ask, why are you so awesome?

1068
00:51:27,211 --> 00:51:30,469
Rym: They ask, I'm actually super awesome, too.

1069
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:35,109
Scott: Tell me about something related to my awesomeness that may be related to you.

1070
00:51:36,391 --> 00:51:41,370
Rym: Actually, the question we've gotten most that is starting to get annoying and I feel like I need to specifically head this one off.

1071
00:51:42,071 --> 00:51:44,470
Rym: Any panel, doesn't matter what the topic is, anime, gaming, whatever.

1072
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:45,459
Rym: Have you played X?

1073
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,227
Scott: Have you seen X?

1074
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:53,630
Rym: And the thing is, if those things were directly relevant to what we just talked about, like really strongly, that would be fine.

1075
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:55,315
Rym: They never are.

1076
00:51:55,878 --> 00:51:58,030
Rym: Never ask that question of anyone ever.

1077
00:51:58,530 --> 00:51:58,631
Scott: Yeah.

1078
00:51:58,753 --> 00:51:59,522
Scott: Have you heard of this?

1079
00:51:59,562 --> 00:52:00,210
Scott: Have you heard of that?

1080
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:00,970
Rym: Have you played this?

1081
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:01,800
Rym: There's one exception.

1082
00:52:01,841 --> 00:52:02,570
Rym: There's one exception.

1083
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:11,550
Rym: When we were at that panel at the first MAGFest where the guy was like, so you might want to get like, what if you gave your players in the game a little bit of control of the narrative?

1084
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:13,870
Rym: Like a little bit like you might break your game.

1085
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:15,330
Scott: Have you have you heard of Burning Wind?

1086
00:52:15,972 --> 00:52:16,654
Rym: Scott Reisand.

1087
00:52:16,734 --> 00:52:22,570
Rym: Scott, you basically asked the question, you were like, have you ever heard of Burning Wheel, Inspectors, Lacuna, Dogs in the Vineyard?

1088
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:25,126
Scott: Have you ever heard of any RPG besides D&D?

1089
00:52:26,714 --> 00:52:28,009
Scott: Maybe he's heard of White Wolf or something.

1090
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:34,550
Rym: That guy was in trouble when he was like, I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons since 2002.

1091
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:40,831
Scott: I was like, I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons since 1990.

1092
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,345
Rym: I've owned the D&D books since the 80s.

1093
00:52:42,913 --> 00:52:43,250
Scott: Something.

1094
00:52:43,913 --> 00:52:47,130
Rym: I had the Dungeons and Dragons cyclopedia when I was fucking young.

1095
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:49,609
Scott: And the weird thing is because he didn't seem that much younger than us.

1096
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:51,664
Scott: But I've been playing D&D since 1990 something.

1097
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:53,066
Rym: Yeah.

1098
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:58,810
Scott: Elementary or middle school, I think I had something.

1099
00:52:59,531 --> 00:53:00,997
Rym: I was obsessed with it.

1100
00:53:01,037 --> 00:53:01,639
Rym: I owned it all.

1101
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:04,410
Rym: I didn't really get to play a real game of D&D in my middle school.

1102
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:05,293
Scott: I played it when I was 13.

1103
00:53:05,293 --> 00:53:06,479
Scott: So 1995, I played Dungeons and Dragons.

1104
00:53:09,672 --> 00:53:12,387
Rym: Middle school is when I really got to do it and then high school I had real D&D.

1105
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:18,770
Scott: I played real second edition advanced Dungeons and Dragons in the year of 1995.

1106
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:19,955
Rym: That was my favorite D&D.

1107
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:25,478
Rym: Though I had the rules cyclopedia and I wanted to play regular Dungeons and Dragons, I never got anyone to play it with me.

1108
00:53:25,578 --> 00:53:27,809
Rym: I ran it for a few people but they always hated it.

1109
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:32,090
Scott: I played it more seriously in 1997 or 98.

1110
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:32,960
Rym: And then 2000 happened.

1111
00:53:33,931 --> 00:53:34,341
Scott: I think it was '97.

1112
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:36,790
Rym: And we played it with Dammit Dwayne.

1113
00:53:37,097 --> 00:53:37,282
Scott: Yup.

1114
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:38,529
Scott: Dammit Dwayne.

1115
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:39,856
Scott: So '95, '97, and 2000 were my D&Ds.

1116
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:47,730
Rym: I almost, almost want to play like an old school D&D game but then I remember how great Burning Wheel is.

1117
00:53:47,770 --> 00:54:00,310
Scott: I want to play an old school D&D game and not play it at all as a role playing game and play it only as a dungeon-y game and mostly concentrate on using, not just doing maximum average damage, but maybe like everyone's a wizard.

1118
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:00,783
Rym: Yup.

1119
00:54:01,415 --> 00:54:01,787
Rym: Or sorcerer.

1120
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:04,850
Rym: I use Mage Hand to turn the switch across from the pit.

1121
00:54:05,051 --> 00:54:11,050
Scott: Everyone has magical classes only and go relatively high levels so you can get tons of spells.

1122
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,510
Scott: Or maybe fuck memorization, you can just cast your spells.

1123
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,130
Rym: You know, we could just do a dungeon crawl.

1124
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:21,939
Scott: Yeah, the thing is, I sort of feel like if we wanted to do the dungeon crawl only- No, micro dungeons, yes.

1125
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,990
Scott: But you could do micro dungeons with Burning Wheel better.

1126
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:28,510
Scott: But, do play maybe one of those stupid games like Descent or something.

1127
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,761
Rym: No, because those abstracted too much.

1128
00:54:30,882 --> 00:54:31,827
Rym: They're too polished.

1129
00:54:31,847 --> 00:54:32,370
Rym: They're wow.

1130
00:54:32,793 --> 00:54:35,450
Rym: In those, it's so abstract you're not actually doing anything.

1131
00:54:35,991 --> 00:54:39,870
Rym: It's just, the abstracted action of attacking is all that matters.

1132
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:53,350
Rym: In an old school D&D dungeon crawl, like Tomb of Horrors, it comes down to, I walk 15 feet forward and then I pull out my 10 foot pole and I stand on this square when I push the button.

1133
00:54:54,331 --> 00:54:55,719
Rym: That shit is what I want to do.

1134
00:54:55,739 --> 00:54:57,610
Rym: If I'm not at that level, I don't care.

1135
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:02,028
Scott: You can do shit like, you know, "Alright, a large tree blocks your

1136
00:55:02,068 --> 00:55:02,370
Scott: path.".

1137
00:55:02,531 --> 00:55:06,130
Rym: I cast Bigby's Crushing Fist and get rid of that tree.

1138
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:09,002
Scott: Yeah, or, you know, "Alright, I summon

1139
00:55:09,424 --> 00:55:10,248
Scott: termites.".

1140
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:16,930
Scott: You know, it's like when you have D&D, you can get all creative with the magics and just come up with ridiculous shit.

1141
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:18,460
Scott: "There's a gelatinous cube in the

1142
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,267
Scott: hallway!".

1143
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:21,664
Scott: You know, "I tricked the bad guys into going into

1144
00:55:22,067 --> 00:55:22,288
Scott: it.".

1145
00:55:22,612 --> 00:55:23,308
Scott: You know, stuff like that.

1146
00:55:23,933 --> 00:55:29,824
Rym: I remember the first D&D game I ran for the crew, I don't know if you were there or not, but Dammit Dwayne was supposed to run our D&D game.

1147
00:55:30,105 --> 00:55:30,729
Rym: He didn't show up.

1148
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:32,489
Rym: It was like the first or second rwag.

1149
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:46,490
Rym: And I remember I just made up this dungeon and the whole combination of it, because it was like I was doing off the top of my head, it was like 10 minutes long, was there was a skeleton that attacks the party, but really, it was a skeleton suspended in a gelatinous cube.

1150
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:48,269
Scott: Gelatinous cube is my favorite if you couldn't tell.

1151
00:55:50,253 --> 00:55:51,630
Scott: Except for Death Knight, also good.

1152
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:55,170
Rym: Death Knights are really good because they can just cast Fireball for some fucking reason.

1153
00:55:55,913 --> 00:55:57,010
Scott: Can't they cast Disintegrate?

1154
00:55:57,391 --> 00:55:58,650
Rym: They can Fireball you too, I'm pretty sure.

1155
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:00,130
Rym: I'm pretty sure they can Disintegrate, yeah.

1156
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:01,349
Rym: Pretty sure they can Fireball you.

1157
00:56:01,612 --> 00:56:01,909
Rym: Anyway.

1158
00:56:02,212 --> 00:56:02,404
Rym: Anyway.

1159
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:05,570
Scott: They can also have the horrible touch of death, if I'm not mistaken.

1160
00:56:06,351 --> 00:56:08,490
Scott: I have to go check my monstrous manual when I get home.

1161
00:56:08,755 --> 00:56:08,843
Rym: Yeah?

1162
00:56:09,595 --> 00:56:10,049
Scott: I have a copy.

1163
00:56:10,911 --> 00:56:11,564
Rym: I think that's enough.

1164
00:56:11,605 --> 00:56:11,850
Rym: nothing.

1165
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:13,110
Rym: It's about an hour worth of nothing.

1166
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:13,232
Scott: Really?

1167
00:56:13,252 --> 00:56:14,410
Scott: You're done with the nothing episode?

1168
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:15,009
Scott: It's been an hour.

1169
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:16,389
Scott: The mishmash of all geekeries?

1170
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:20,650
Scott: Yeah, you better come up with some Thursday ideas, otherwise, Geek Knights Thursday is gonna get cancelled.

1171
00:56:20,832 --> 00:56:22,429
Rym: I wanted to talk about swimming pools.

1172
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:24,370
Scott: What were you gonna say about swimming pools?

1173
00:56:24,671 --> 00:56:26,069
Rym: How to find bodies in them, for one.

1174
00:56:26,697 --> 00:56:27,290
Scott: We already did that.

1175
00:56:29,797 --> 00:56:30,289
Rym: Other stuff.

1176
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:32,550
Scott: Sorry for the crappy episode, blame Rym.

1177
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:33,610
Rym: You know what's gonna be funny?

1178
00:56:34,431 --> 00:56:36,910
Rym: Every time we've done a crap episode, we've been like, this is shit.

1179
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:38,929
Rym: People like it more than the episodes we think are good.

1180
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:40,587
Scott: Blame Rym.

1181
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:41,053
Rym: Yep.

1182
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:41,788
Rym: Blame me.

1183
00:56:42,433 --> 00:56:43,310
Scott: Or give credit to Rym.

1184
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:43,886
Rym: It's all me.

1185
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:49,010
Scott: And then we will return to regularly good Geek Knights again.

1186
00:56:49,152 --> 00:56:50,370
Rym: Regularly scheduled Geek Knights.

1187
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:51,005
Rym: Next week.

1188
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:51,975
Rym: Some radio-free.

1189
00:56:52,056 --> 00:56:53,590
Rym: Equestria is gonna start back up again.

1190
00:56:53,850 --> 00:56:54,248
Scott: Monday, Wednesday.

1191
00:56:54,551 --> 00:56:56,170
Rym: And all these other pony videos I promised.

1192
00:56:57,630 --> 00:56:58,222
Rym: And... PAX.

1193
00:56:59,631 --> 00:57:01,309
Rym: We won't do a show right before PAX.

1194
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:02,264
Rym: No.

1195
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:03,553
Rym: FYI.

1196
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:04,550
Rym: No kidding.

1197
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:12,410
Rym: This has been Geek Knights with Rym and Scott.

1198
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:17,550
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1199
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:22,950
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1200
00:57:23,212 --> 00:57:25,890
Rym: Remember, Geek Knights is not one, but four different shows.

1201
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:30,630
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1202
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:34,146
Scott: Geek Knights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1203
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:38,430
Scott: Geek Knights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1204
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:41,570
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
