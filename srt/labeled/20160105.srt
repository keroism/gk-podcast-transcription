1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,859
Rym: It's Tuesday, January 5th, 2016.

2
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:14,309
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,856 --> 00:00:15,267
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:16,817
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:16,858 --> 00:00:18,890
Rym: Tonight, we're back with games.

6
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:21,343
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,874 --> 00:00:25,730
Rym: So we had our traditional New Year's party.

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:32,549
Rym: One of our friends, someone always kind of bites that bullet to host everyone we know at a giant party every year.

9
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:40,210
Rym: And in keeping with our sort of tradition, what we pretty much do at these parties is play games.

10
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:41,530
Rym: Eating.

11
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:46,609
Rym: At like 1145, 1150, someone's like, "Hey guys, it's almost the New

12
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:46,790
Rym: Year.".

13
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:48,661
Rym: And then at like 1158, we're like, "Oh, right,

14
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:48,823
Rym: yeah.".

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,849
Rym: And everyone kind of stands there looking at their cell phones.

16
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:53,156
Rym: It hits midnight.

17
00:00:53,216 --> 00:00:53,519
Rym: We go,

18
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:53,660
Rym: "Woo!"

19
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,830
Rym: Arbitrary times.

20
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,389
Rym: And then we continue playing games.

21
00:01:01,073 --> 00:01:03,030
Rym: It was a pretty much typical party though.

22
00:01:03,491 --> 00:01:04,709
Rym: And we played a lot of games.

23
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:10,550
Rym: Actually, I think I played more games at this New Year's weekend than I even played at the last PAX.

24
00:01:11,692 --> 00:01:15,630
Scott: I don't know about that, but I mean, it was mostly just games we've already played before.

25
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:16,467
Scott: We just played them.

26
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:16,971
Scott: Yup.

27
00:01:17,293 --> 00:01:19,869
Rym: Which is interesting because at PAXes, usually...

28
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,289
Scott: Which is bad for GeekNights because what the hell do we talk about now?

29
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,950
Rym: But usually I'm playing a game and I play it.

30
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,050
Rym: There's always like one or two people who haven't played the game before.

31
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:29,808
Rym: So we end up teaching the game and it's sort of like an experience.

32
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,529
Rym: But to get together with our crew, it's pretty much like we sit down.

33
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,150
Rym: A glory to Rome just opens on the table.

34
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,490
Rym: No one ever really consented to that being the game.

35
00:01:39,993 --> 00:01:41,509
Rym: And then we just play it.

36
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,769
Rym: A bunch of steely-eyed experts staring each other the fuck down.

37
00:01:46,313 --> 00:01:47,950
Rym: I miss that kind of gaming a lot.

38
00:01:49,273 --> 00:01:50,290
Scott: That's why you should play Netrunner.

39
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,750
Scott: Because when you play Netrunner, you go and you sit down and everyone there knows how to play.

40
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,189
Scott: And you just bust it open.

41
00:01:56,952 --> 00:01:59,470
Scott: That's why I stopped going to board game night and did Netrunner instead.

42
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,590
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time Netrunner scratches different kinds of itches.

43
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:07,270
Rym: I'm not... I like the three to five player dynamic more than the one-on-one.

44
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,737
Scott: And my one-on-one game... You want some political game.

45
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:10,870
Scott: You don't want some skill game.

46
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,077
Rym: It's not necessarily political.

47
00:02:12,097 --> 00:02:14,110
Rym: Puerto Rico is not significantly political.

48
00:02:14,432 --> 00:02:16,050
Scott: It still is more political than zero.

49
00:02:17,192 --> 00:02:18,690
Rym: Yes, that is technically true.

50
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,696
Rym: You are correct.

51
00:02:19,756 --> 00:02:20,845
Rym: You win the semantic war.

52
00:02:20,885 --> 00:02:21,510
Rym: Congratulations.

53
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:30,430
Rym: But partly too, my one player pure thought game is Advance Wars and I maxed it out.

54
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,970
Rym: And I don't know if I have it in me to max out another game.

55
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:38,370
Rym: And I'm not willing to play a one-on-one game that I'm not willing to max out anymore.

56
00:02:39,732 --> 00:02:43,150
Rym: Either I'm going to be one of the best or I'm not going to bother.

57
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,090
Rym: I don't want to be middle of the road.

58
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,229
Scott: But being the best at Advance Wars doesn't get you anywhere.

59
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,910
Scott: If you're the best at Netrunner, sure, it's not like it gets you an Olympic gold medal.

60
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,570
Scott: But actually, that can get you quite a lot.

61
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,690
Rym: Yeah, but it'd be a similar amount of work to what it took me to be good at Advance Wars.

62
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,320
Scott: Maybe, maybe not.

63
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,310
Scott: It's not that hard a game.

64
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,297
Rym: No, it isn't.

65
00:03:00,418 --> 00:03:01,750
Rym: But also, that ship sailed.

66
00:03:02,011 --> 00:03:04,230
Rym: I'd have to go learn all the cards and pay attention.

67
00:03:04,812 --> 00:03:06,670
Rym: I'd have to play it constantly and regularly.

68
00:03:07,492 --> 00:03:09,065
Scott: You know, I'm doing it.

69
00:03:09,186 --> 00:03:09,690
Scott: I got no problems.

70
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,717
Rym: Yeah, you are doing it.

71
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,150
Rym: I'll play every other game instead.

72
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,970
Rym: But anyway, there's some news.

73
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,055
Rym: But first, there's a rumor.

74
00:03:15,135 --> 00:03:18,030
Rym: This isn't really Tuesday, but the rumor seems pretty legit.

75
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:21,260
Rym: Apple might have the 6C or the 7C in spring.

76
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:24,950
Scott: This has nothing to do with games.

77
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,630
Rym: No, but it's an iPhone that's tiny.

78
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,150
Rym: And if it happens, I'm switching to an iPhone.

79
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,410
Rym: Which means I'll start playing mobile games because most mobile games are iPhone only.

80
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:38,560
Rym: Yeah.

81
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,249
Rym: So you got any news?

82
00:03:40,472 --> 00:03:41,330
Scott: I do have a news.

83
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,508
Rym: It's not about Netrunner, is it?

84
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,987
Scott: It is about Netrunner.

85
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,550
Scott: There's other game news out there like AGDQ is happening now.

86
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,670
Rym: I was going to talk about AGDQ in a little bit, but anyway.

87
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:52,824
Scott: You can do that if you want to.

88
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,930
Scott: But something big happened in Netrunner land.

89
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:05,190
Scott: And even if you don't care about Netrunner, this is relevant to all kinds of games that are the kind of games that change constantly over time.

90
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,985
Scott: Which includes every professional sport, Magic, Netrunner.

91
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,889
Rym: Hockey has changed so many times.

92
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:16,970
Rym: When I started watching hockey seriously again a few years ago, some things were different that really mattered.

93
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,010
Rym: It took me a while to notice even the jerseys had swapped.

94
00:04:21,616 --> 00:04:21,777
Scott: Yup.

95
00:04:21,797 --> 00:04:29,050
Scott: So the big change that made in Netrunner was basically, first of all, there was a card that they won't admit to it, but I'm pretty sure was misprinted.

96
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,410
Scott: Or at least they've told us that it had this property in playtesting.

97
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,729
Scott: It was unique in playtesting.

98
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,150
Scott: But for some reason, once it got to the real, the printed one wasn't unique.

99
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,410
Scott: So now they've ratted it to make it unique again because it was a big problem.

100
00:04:41,696 --> 00:04:42,370
Scott: So that's fine.

101
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,630
Scott: The other thing they did is they made this restricted list of some sort.

102
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:55,604
Scott: It's not actually a restricted list because there are many different approaches that various card games have used to sort of, "Oops, we made a card that was too strong.

103
00:04:55,644 --> 00:04:56,128
Scott: Let's fix

104
00:04:56,188 --> 00:04:56,229
Scott: it.".

105
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,786
Rym: Yeah, well like Magic would either have you put it in the tier system.

106
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:05,221
Scott: Right, so Magic, what they did is they had different ways to play Magic and different cards were allowed in different types.

107
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,368
Rym: And even within that, you can only have four of a card, but there were some cards you could only have one of.

108
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,409
Scott: And there were some cards you could have zero of.

109
00:05:14,274 --> 00:05:18,062
Scott: And once they found out a card was a problem, like Channel, they're just like, "Well, zero of

110
00:05:18,102 --> 00:05:18,445
Scott: those.".

111
00:05:19,591 --> 00:05:20,850
Scott: Not allowed to use that card anymore.

112
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:25,210
Rym: Channel Fireball, Mox Emerald, Black Lotus, Demonic Tutor, One Turn Win.

113
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,290
Scott: They would just ban, right?

114
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:35,550
Scott: So in other games, so for example in the Game of Thrones card game, which is the first LCG, which is what Netrunner is, what they did is they made a restricted list.

115
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:46,290
Scott: So I don't know exactly how it works, but the general gist is you can have this card in your deck, but if you do, you can't have any of those cards.

116
00:05:46,371 --> 00:05:48,230
Scott: And if you have those cards, you can't have these.

117
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,290
Scott: So basically this broke up nasty combos.

118
00:05:50,815 --> 00:05:55,090
Scott: Like there were broken combos, but the cards that made up the combos weren't individually broken.

119
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:57,049
Scott: They were just fine as long as you didn't combo them.

120
00:05:57,453 --> 00:06:09,207
Scott: So it'd be like, "You can have Channel, as long as you don't have any of these disintegrates or fireballs or any X cost spell to go with it, you can have your

121
00:06:09,247 --> 00:06:09,628
Scott: channel.".

122
00:06:10,513 --> 00:06:13,721
Scott: And if you have any of these disintegrates, you can't have any channels.

123
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:14,226
Scott: It's like that.

124
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:17,770
Rym: Which I feel like that's unmaintainable in a card game.

125
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:19,729
Scott: Well, it worked for them.

126
00:06:20,611 --> 00:06:29,549
Scott: Anyway, so in Netrunner, they were so proud that over a long period of time, since the Android Netrunner started, they didn't have to do any of that.

127
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:34,710
Scott: What they would do is they would just print new cards to sort of help counteract older cards.

128
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,625
Scott: And sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't.

129
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,610
Scott: But it comes down to two things.

130
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:46,590
Scott: Number one, the person who's in charge of Netrunner or was the lead designer moved on to go do another game, and now we have a new lead designer.

131
00:06:47,214 --> 00:06:48,569
Scott: So they're making different decisions.

132
00:06:49,931 --> 00:07:08,710
Scott: And two, over the course of multiple years of Netrunner play and looking at the statistics, which the new lead designer and old lead designer both did, they've seen that for a living card game, the whole point of Netrunner, the reason I've been able to play it for so long, because they keep putting out new cards and the game keeps changing.

133
00:07:10,694 --> 00:07:16,749
Scott: You don't see people having such this huge community and world championships around a game that doesn't freaking change ever.

134
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:19,270
Scott: It's like if we were playing Settlers.

135
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,530
Rym: Yeah, except chess.

136
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:21,649
Scott: And Scrabble.

137
00:07:22,232 --> 00:07:23,530
Scott: But people are as obsessed with it.

138
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:24,510
Scott: But it's so boring.

139
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:32,090
Rym: Go has not changed since there was a time back in medieval times they had the rule to balance the fact that one color was more strong than the other color.

140
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,250
Scott: All right, so chess go.

141
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:41,649
Scott: What happens there is even though the game itself doesn't change over time, the game is so big that people still haven't figured it out yet.

142
00:07:41,973 --> 00:07:42,380
Rym: Ah, true.

143
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:42,970
Rym: That is true.

144
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,570
Rym: I mean, Tic Tac Toe, the scene died once someone figured out the optimal opening.

145
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:51,190
Scott: It's like baseball hasn't changed that much, but people keep getting better at baseball.

146
00:07:51,571 --> 00:08:00,070
Scott: If you just had the Netrunner core set, people would max it out and then it would come down to luck because the game isn't as big, there isn't as much to improve.

147
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,285
Scott: There's a limit to how, you know.

148
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:07,929
Scott: It's like, well, we've discovered the best possible deck and the best possible way to play and now it just comes down to shuffling the cards.

149
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,529
Scott: You need to keep adding more cards or changing the cards around to keep it interesting.

150
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:18,870
Rym: Or make a game like chess where it's so deep that people will continually come up with novel ways to play parts of the game.

151
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:24,610
Scott: There aren't that many novel ways to play because a lot of cards are just mathematically obviously less better than--.

152
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,410
Rym: Granted, arguably there aren't that many novel ways to play chess.

153
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,690
Rym: I've been reading studies of current strategy.

154
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,929
Rym: Front halves of chess games are not evolving in any significant way among human players.

155
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,745
Scott: Not now, but what if you were playing chess in the 40s or the 30s or the 1800s?

156
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,650
Rym: It seems like in the late 80s it started to solidify.

157
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:56,738
Rym: Right, so it took a long time, but maybe this will hurt chess, the fact that it's not-- I think it actually will because it's hit this point where it seems like games are getting longer because players get beyond the point.

158
00:08:56,758 --> 00:08:59,890
Rym: a human could even have a reasonable state of the game.

159
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,250
Scott: So Netrunner, which is a big game but isn't quite as big as chess-- Not quite, not quite.

160
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:09,730
Scott: In terms of depth, room to grow as a player and advance over time, right?

161
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:18,679
Scott: You need new cards to come out, to shake things up, but despite new cards coming out, if you look, certain things are not changing over time.

162
00:09:21,671 --> 00:09:24,724
Scott: There are certain cards that were in 100% of the top decks at the World Championship.

163
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,989
Rym: It's like fantasy football.

164
00:09:26,989 --> 00:09:30,770
Rym: 100% of the teams have one of three quarterbacks.

165
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,053
Scott: Right, exactly.

166
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:39,069
Scott: In other cards it was like 80% of decks, regardless of which deck they were playing, all had this card in it.

167
00:09:39,069 --> 00:09:42,229
Scott: 100%, regardless of what, had this card in it.

168
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:46,050
Scott: And sometimes it's okay that they all have this card, right?

169
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:51,330
Scott: And there's a really basic card, like Sure Gamble, which is just the basic money card that's in the core set.

170
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:53,690
Scott: It makes sense that everyone has that in their deck.

171
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:54,468
Rym: Well, because it's a sure thing.

172
00:09:55,812 --> 00:10:00,330
Scott: It makes sense that 90% of their decks would have this really basic thing in it, right?

173
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,202
Scott: But there are certain other cards that don't.

174
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,189
Scott: It's like, why is this same exact ice in every deck?

175
00:10:09,351 --> 00:10:14,489
Scott: And because everyone's using that one, none of these other ice are getting made, getting used at all.

176
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,810
Scott: We printed all these cards and no one is using them ever because this one exists.

177
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:24,063
Scott: There are other problems where it's like, well, we'd really, you know, there's a card that lets you break any code gate.

178
00:10:24,344 --> 00:10:27,890
Scott: that's three or less, you know, for free, for zero, free.

179
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,743
Scott: And it's a core set card.

180
00:10:29,804 --> 00:10:30,630
Scott: It's like this key thing.

181
00:10:31,451 --> 00:10:33,110
Scott: And it's even easy to break.

182
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:36,709
Scott: You can boost it a little bit and even break things that are four for free.

183
00:10:37,312 --> 00:10:43,710
Scott: So this really hurts them because it's like they want to make all kinds of interesting code gate ice and nobody is using any of these.

184
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,530
Scott: Nobody who's winning is using any code gate ice.

185
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:50,149
Scott: It doesn't matter if there's zero, one, two or three, you know, or even four.

186
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,450
Scott: They're just not using any of these cards.

187
00:10:52,913 --> 00:10:54,850
Scott: So it's like it's restricting their game design.

188
00:10:55,010 --> 00:11:00,850
Scott: Like we can't print any new cards that do that fit in these holes because no one will use them because that card exists.

189
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,110
Rym: And you might think like, oh, maybe the meta would sort it out.

190
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:07,589
Rym: But no, because the cost to having that card in your deck is basically zero.

191
00:11:08,112 --> 00:11:14,610
Rym: But the cost of having a bunch of ice that's really easily broken through by that card completely wrecks you if someone has the card.

192
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,849
Rym: So it only works out if someone happens to not play that card.

193
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:23,430
Scott: So imagine if like there's a card that will totally wreck you if you play is like totally wrecks like 20 different cards.

194
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:26,450
Scott: So people stop playing those 20 different cards because they'll just get wrecked.

195
00:11:26,972 --> 00:11:29,969
Scott: And now people stop playing the card that wrecks those 20 cards also.

196
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:32,790
Scott: But people still won't play any of the cards.

197
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:35,310
Scott: Basically, none of those cards are getting played at all.

198
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,845
Scott: So what they did is they came up with this thing, which is the N.A.P.D.

199
00:11:38,926 --> 00:11:39,850
Scott: most wanted list.

200
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:56,280
Scott: So any card that's on the list, basically, if you know the rules of Netrunner, cost basically reduces your influence by total influence, total by one, but not below one, even if it's in your faction already, which in which case it'd be like it.

201
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,230
Rym: for those of you who've never played.

202
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:05,210
Rym: If in Magic the Gathering, you can only have one color in your deck and then you could have up to 15 points worth of other colors.

203
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:05,871
Scott: Right.

204
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,310
Scott: But now there's your green deck.

205
00:12:07,431 --> 00:12:13,390
Scott: But this really powerful OP green card is still going to cost you a point, even though you're green and normally it would cost you zero points.

206
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,570
Scott: So there's a bunch of cards on the list.

207
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:20,049
Scott: There's a bunch of cards that aren't on the list that maybe should or should not be.

208
00:12:21,412 --> 00:12:24,770
Scott: But it's really going to shake things up in quite an interesting way.

209
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:25,245
Scott: That is.

210
00:12:25,651 --> 00:12:38,290
Scott: And a lot of, you know, the stagnation, hopefully some people are just taking the decks that, like, were the top and just sort of removing a few cards, you know, so that they can basically get 90 percent of the power they had before with the same idea.

211
00:12:39,054 --> 00:12:40,370
Scott: And maybe that's all that'll happen.

212
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:51,030
Scott: But, you know, the fact that they've shown that they're going to do this means that, well, if they don't see the statistics change, if they still see the same decks winning over and over, they're going to push it even further.

213
00:12:51,632 --> 00:12:51,913
Scott: Right.

214
00:12:52,214 --> 00:12:54,762
Scott: And, you know, they like they want the game to.

215
00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:58,148
Scott: it's supposed to be a living game, like living Greyhawk.

216
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:00,637
Scott: They want it to constantly.

217
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,610
Scott: they want to see lots of changes over time.

218
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,149
Scott: They don't want to see the game stagnate.

219
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:18,770
Rym: And the interesting thing is, as much as we talk about analyzing games and game design with a game like this, it is feasible to figure out ahead of time, like if this will work or like what changes you make will affect the game.

220
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,489
Rym: But practically it is not.

221
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:30,570
Rym: It is not feasible for a company to put the resources required to do the kind of playtesting and analysis that would tell them whether or not these changes will affect the meta or not.

222
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:35,830
Rym: So you pretty much got to throw it out there with an educated guess and see what happens.

223
00:13:37,111 --> 00:13:46,179
Rym: So in other news, an auspicious Kickstarter launched today on the 5th of January, the Burning Wheel Codex.

224
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:46,240
Scott: 2016.

225
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,850
Scott: That should have been 2015 to get an extra five in there.

226
00:13:49,531 --> 00:13:49,611
Rym: Yeah.

227
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:56,791
Rym: I mean, I guess you could have waited until May 5th, 2055.

228
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,101
Scott: So he loves those dicks.

229
00:13:58,242 --> 00:13:59,230
Scott: They have a lot of the same number.

230
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:00,595
Rym: It already met its goal.

231
00:14:00,736 --> 00:14:04,170
Rym: It met its goal immediately because it's Burning Wheel.

232
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:08,570
Rym: If you've listened to GeekNights for any amount of time and somehow haven't heard us talk about Burning Wheel.

233
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:09,373
Scott: Seriously?

234
00:14:09,393 --> 00:14:10,863
Rym: I mean, it's not the best.

235
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:11,850
Scott: You must be a brand new listener.

236
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:17,030
Rym: It's not the best role-playing system in the world because that's an impossible question to answer.

237
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,910
Rym: But it is one of the best.

238
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:25,870
Scott: If you want to play a serious, hardcore fantasy role-playing game, this should be the first place you look.

239
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:30,870
Rym: It's the best medieval gritty fantasy role-playing system in the world, in my opinion.

240
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:37,930
Rym: If you want medieval gritty, if you want other kinds of medieval or other kinds of gritty, or you don't want medieval or gritty.

241
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:38,569
Scott: It's also fantasy.

242
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,372
Scott: Yeah.

243
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:40,356
Rym: Fantasy, medieval, gritty.

244
00:14:40,637 --> 00:14:43,245
Rym: You want to have those three things.

245
00:14:43,686 --> 00:14:44,770
Rym: Burning Wheel does it.

246
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,998
Rym: Also, if you want your uncle to hate you.

247
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:49,549
Rym: Burning Wheel's the game where you want your uncle to hate you.

248
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,470
Rym: But Burning Wheel went through, you know, there were a lot of editions of it.

249
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,244
Rym: And then there was the gold edition was the gold standard.

250
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:58,470
Rym: Like that was Burning Wheel.

251
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:58,831
Scott: Right.

252
00:14:58,851 --> 00:15:01,610
Scott: First there was Burning Wheel, then there was revised, and then there was gold.

253
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:05,023
Scott: It's like, all right, we fixed most, you know, 90% of the problems.

254
00:15:05,425 --> 00:15:06,810
Scott: We rejiggered, we streamlined.

255
00:15:07,335 --> 00:15:08,869
Scott: Burning Wheel gold is the one you should play.

256
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,169
Scott: Burning Wheel gold is still the one you should play.

257
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:18,970
Rym: It is, but gold came out, but there was a lot of other material in Burning Wheel that came out in the revised era.

258
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:23,686
Scott: And even before, like the monster man, the monstrous compendium is pre-revised.

259
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:32,330
Scott: The adventure burner, the blossoms are falling, a lot of these extra books were in the revised era.

260
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:33,073
Scott: Right.

261
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:34,458
Scott: So it's like the same thing with D&D.

262
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:37,930
Scott: It's like you have your second edition, you know, the complete paladin.

263
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:43,470
Scott: And then third edition comes out and like, well, I guess I'm throwing on my complete paladin also, because that's useless now.

264
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:51,290
Rym: So I didn't actually look at exactly what all is included in this, but basically the Kickstarter is, hey, if you want to buy the right, the Burning Wheel gold book, you can get it real cheap.

265
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:57,410
Rym: And you can get the codex, which is basically going to be the equivalent of you have your D&D books.

266
00:15:58,112 --> 00:16:03,310
Rym: And then next to them, you have all those brown books, like the complete guide to elves.

267
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:04,111
Scott: Right.

268
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:14,589
Scott: So basically what happened was, you know, things like the adventure burner had very, and the magic burner had short print runs, weren't reprinted, weren't kept in print, and there was a high demand for them.

269
00:16:15,251 --> 00:16:22,530
Scott: And, you know, Lucas has reasons for not printing them probably because they go with revised, you know, he thinks that they're flawed.

270
00:16:23,592 --> 00:16:38,910
Scott: So in the Burning Wheel codex, which goes with Burning Wheel gold, you get rules for magic, rules for monsters, you know, commentary, all the things that were in Adventure Burner, monsters, you know, all the things.

271
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:44,590
Rym: A companion to the Burning Wheel gold system, including additional life has magic and rules commentary, because we know Luke.

272
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:52,830
Rym: And I'm sure that Luke, if he had his druthers, would be happy to rewrite the rules of Burning Wheel to make all the clarifications necessary.

273
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,018
Rym: But in reality, no one is going to do that.

274
00:16:57,739 --> 00:17:02,330
Rym: It is easier to write commentary and errata than it is to rewrite rules.

275
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:03,311
Scott: Right.

276
00:17:03,532 --> 00:17:10,130
Rym: So take it from someone who's been reading a lot of rules to games, because we're doing a panel on writing rules for games at PAX South.

277
00:17:10,351 --> 00:17:15,550
Scott: If you want to play some Burning Wheel, this is something you probably want, especially if you already play some Burning Wheel.

278
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:23,290
Rym: Yeah, also, seriously, it's 50 bucks to get the codex hardcover and Burning Wheel gold hardcover.

279
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:28,310
Scott: Oh, if you already have Burning Wheel gold, how much does it cost to just get the codex?

280
00:17:29,832 --> 00:17:30,489
Scott: That's real cheap.

281
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:33,889
Rym: Yeah, D&D costs more than 50 bucks, guys.

282
00:17:34,212 --> 00:17:34,769
Scott: I know, right?

283
00:17:36,212 --> 00:17:39,730
Scott: So this is your chance to buy some Burning Wheels if you don't have it already.

284
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:43,158
Rym: So the other thing, it's not really news.

285
00:17:43,459 --> 00:17:45,744
Rym: You know AGDQ is happening, I assume.

286
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:48,010
Rym: If you don't, it's Games Done Quick.

287
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:57,190
Scott: And you know, when I first looked at the schedule, usually in the past two or three years when I've looked at the schedule, I've found games and things on the schedule that I definitely want to see that.

288
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:08,670
Scott: This time, I looked at the schedule and there was only a few things I wanted to see, but I'm bored at work, I tune in, and every time I tune in, it's something I want to see, even though I didn't saw it on the schedule.

289
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,458
Rym: Well, you're like, "Okay, Disney's Aladdin.

290
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,008
Rym: Why do I care about a 17-minute run of Disney's

291
00:18:13,068 --> 00:18:13,330
Rym: Aladdin?".

292
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,027
Scott: When I saw that Aladdin run, I was like, "Damn,

293
00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:16,289
Scott: son."

294
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,110
Scott: You see through the Matrix on that crap.

295
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,989
Scott: Plus, it was real funny watching all the cutscenes.

296
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,970
Rym: The craziest one that I watched so far was the NecroDancer one.

297
00:18:26,451 --> 00:18:31,141
Rym: That, like, I can't even, like, I went back and watched sections again.

298
00:18:31,161 --> 00:18:33,968
Rym: I can't imagine how he was making the decisions.

299
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,050
Rym: he was making that quickly.

300
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,509
Rym: He was doing APM shit like you do in an RTS.

301
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:48,970
Scott: The thing I don't understand is how someone could dedicate so much of their life to just playing NecroDancer and not get bored of it and, like, want to keep doing it and perfecting and honing, you know, their NecroDancer blade to be so freaking sharp.

302
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:49,712
Scott: It's like, really?

303
00:18:49,773 --> 00:18:51,842
Scott: Wow, that's dedication that I do not have.

304
00:18:51,902 --> 00:18:53,810
Scott: I couldn't even play the game for more than, like, a little while.

305
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,315
Rym: Like, I did that with Advance Wars.

306
00:18:55,415 --> 00:18:57,423
Rym: We know people who have done that with Counter-Strike.

307
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,470
Rym: Most people pick a small number of games.

308
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:03,830
Scott: But that's not nearly as grueling in the physical taxing area as NecroDancer.

309
00:19:04,251 --> 00:19:06,910
Scott: Yeah, NecroDancer is a hard- Especially on the mode he's playing.

310
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:14,050
Rym: Yeah, he's playing on a mode where, basically, one hit kills you, you can't touch gold or you die, you can only ever have a dagger.

311
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,450
Scott: You have to hit something on every single beat no matter what.

312
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:27,130
Rym: Yep, if you ever don't hit the button, dig the wrong way or anything, death, the game developers themselves, if you put the game in the mode that this dude played, they pop up a warning.

313
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,490
Scott: It says they're pretty sure this is impossible.

314
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,270
Rym: Yeah, they're like, there is no way.

315
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,430
Scott: They thought it was impossible.

316
00:19:31,811 --> 00:19:36,610
Rym: And Spoody Biscuit, I don't know what to tell you, but good God.

317
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:42,870
Rym: The one I'm most looking forward to, actually, is the Secret of Mana one and the Final Fantasy IV one, those two.

318
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:47,447
Scott: So, the Secret of Mana one, I didn't realize- See, normally, I don't need to watch Secret of Mana being played, right?

319
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:48,150
Scott: I know what's gonna happen.

320
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:57,430
Scott: But what I found out is that this- I saw earlier in the AGDQ, during that Disney block with the Aladdin game, a guy was playing Goof Troop.

321
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,273
Scott: And I was like, what the fuck?

322
00:19:58,293 --> 00:19:59,437
Scott: I don't give a shit, right?

323
00:19:59,477 --> 00:20:03,390
Scott: It looks like some combination of Lolo and something else, only this Goofy and this Max.

324
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,229
Rym: I played that game.

325
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:11,110
Scott: Anyway, but the guy was playing with two SNES controllers and he was only one person playing a co-op game.

326
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:11,693
Scott: And you know what?

327
00:20:12,115 --> 00:20:14,990
Scott: That same guy is doing the Secret of Mana run.

328
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,328
Rym: Yeah, any percent, one P, two C.

329
00:20:18,111 --> 00:20:20,179
Scott: One player, two controller.

330
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:22,750
Scott: That is why I have to see the Secret of Mana run.

331
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:28,349
Rym: And then, Scott, right after that, it's only 25 minutes, is Turtles in Time, one P, two C.

332
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:32,519
Scott: Whoa, one P, two C. Serious biz.

333
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,569
Scott: But anyway, yeah, that's gonna be exciting because of the one P, two C.

334
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,788
Rym: Yeah, and there's some classics here, like the Mario 2 in 15 minutes.

335
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,510
Scott: Well, you gotta see the Super Metroid every time, no matter what.

336
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,793
Rym: Yeah, 'cause that's always crazy.

337
00:20:44,174 --> 00:20:56,510
Rym: But I'm kinda into the Final Fantasy IV one, 'cause I actually know a lot about the glitchy stuff you can do in that game, but- It says no 64 floor glitch, so I think that means that it's any percent, which means anything is on the table.

338
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:01,150
Scott: They can do all sorts of other glitches, but not that one, 'cause that one, I guess, is bullshit or something.

339
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,429
Rym: Yeah, but what's interesting- so here's why I'm interested in that.

340
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:14,330
Rym: The main set of glitches I know about are- they're kinda like that gunslinger thing, where you can sorta fuck with the game and make weird crap happen.

341
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:19,230
Rym: I think it's gonna be one of those situations where he's hitting buttons to program the RNG to make nonsense happen.

342
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:24,150
Scott: Yeah, I'm wondering, like, it's really hard, a game with random encounters like that can be really difficult to-.

343
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:34,629
Rym: Yeah, I thought that, but then I watched the Chrono Trigger, and the guy was like, "Oh, I gotta do this and this and this and this and this and this and this, so that when I get to this one random encounter, this one guy does this one thing that lets me beat it real

344
00:21:34,649 --> 00:21:34,830
Rym: quick.".

345
00:21:36,172 --> 00:21:40,030
Scott: I also watched them play D&D Shadow over Mystara today.

346
00:21:41,011 --> 00:21:41,628
Scott: No deaths.

347
00:21:42,353 --> 00:21:42,547
Rym: What?

348
00:21:43,315 --> 00:21:44,908
Rym: No- Well, I guess, yeah, it's AGDQ.

349
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,289
Scott: He did not die.

350
00:21:46,752 --> 00:21:47,275
Rym: You know what it is?

351
00:21:47,316 --> 00:21:47,979
Rym: You know what you said?

352
00:21:48,321 --> 00:21:49,810
Rym: How could someone dedicate their life to that?

353
00:21:51,011 --> 00:22:00,470
Rym: AGDQ, if you are that person, if you have decided to dedicate your life to, like, Goof Troop or Super Monkey Ball, this is your time to shine.

354
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:06,650
Scott: And all of us who cannot do such a thing will watch upon you and honor you and heaps praise upon you.

355
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:07,816
Rym: The honor is deserved.

356
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,110
Rym: My field of fucks has overfloweth.

357
00:22:16,531 --> 00:22:18,355
Rym: So, things of the day.

358
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:24,590
Rym: This is some text, and you just have to read it all, but I'm going to read for you the title of this article.

359
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:30,570
Rym: I did some cursory research to make sure this wasn't just an elaborate scam, and I found a lot of corroborating evidence.

360
00:22:31,272 --> 00:22:33,029
Scott: The title is- It's an elaborate scam.

361
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:38,600
Rym: The true story of Roland the Farter and how the internet killed- As in?

362
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,050
Rym: Yes, professional flatulence.

363
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:48,770
Scott: Well, I think Rym is the most upset about this because he would become a professional flatulator if that was a possibility.

364
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:52,988
Rym: I was describing- I was telling Emily about this the other day, and she was like, "How would you fart on

365
00:22:53,008 --> 00:22:53,370
Rym: command?".

366
00:22:53,431 --> 00:22:54,947
Rym: And I was like, "Well, because I

367
00:22:55,008 --> 00:22:55,230
Rym: can.".

368
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,489
Scott: And then you just went and farted?

369
00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:00,229
Rym: Well, no, because I at least have to prime it, so I gotta go-.

370
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,989
Scott: Well, I guess Roland is a little better than you, huh?

371
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:02,452
Rym: I don't know.

372
00:23:02,492 --> 00:23:07,090
Rym: Maybe before his performance, he'd do the thing to prime his butt to be able to fart.

373
00:23:07,411 --> 00:23:11,428
Rym: So, I'm gonna read for you just the beginning few paragraphs of this.

374
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:11,870
Rym: It's short.

375
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:21,070
Rym: Roland, court minstrel to 12th century English king Henry II, probably had many talents, but history has recorded only one.

376
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:32,230
Rym: Referred to variously as Roland le Sausser, Roland le Farter, Roland le Petoy, and Roland the Farter, Roland really had one job in the court.

377
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:43,888
Rym: Every Christmas, during the court's riotous pageant, he performed a dance that ended with, quote, "One jump, one whistle, and one fart, executed

378
00:23:44,068 --> 00:23:45,170
Rym: simultaneously.".

379
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:51,087
Rym: For this, Roland was gifted a manor house in Hemmingsdon, Suffolk, and more than 100 acres of land.

380
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:56,070
Scott: Listen, in the medieval times, they didn't have no Netflix, alright?

381
00:23:57,191 --> 00:24:19,888
Rym: So, basically this article talks about the real talent of farting on command, which was part of the repertoire of the equivalent of Gleeman from ye olden times, leading up to this black and white photograph from the late 1800s of a man performing flatulence at the Moulin Rouge theater, and how actually this art continued until the early 1900s.

382
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:25,982
Rym: So, yeah, this is quite a wild ride, this article.

383
00:24:26,002 --> 00:24:28,429
Rym: Oh, and there are people who still do this.

384
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:29,771
Rym: Mr.

385
00:24:29,831 --> 00:24:38,530
Rym: Methane, apparently, is the current sort of well-known world fart dude, and here's a picture of him farting on a birthday cake, I guess.

386
00:24:38,771 --> 00:24:40,108
Scott: I guess he's trying to light those candles up.

387
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:41,678
Rym: But he's holding like a video game?

388
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:42,363
Rym: I don't know what he's doing.

389
00:24:42,383 --> 00:24:43,229
Rym: There's something going on there.

390
00:24:44,112 --> 00:24:46,508
Scott: Alright, well, I'm not really interested in Mr.

391
00:24:46,548 --> 00:24:46,870
Scott: Methane.

392
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:50,010
Rym: Yeah, but I'm real interested in the history of Roland the Farter.

393
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,192
Rym: Okay.

394
00:24:50,273 --> 00:24:51,690
Rym: So, what do you got?

395
00:24:52,590 --> 00:25:07,229
Scott: So, in Dubai, a place where there's mad people with mad monies, you know, they built a whole bunch of buildings there, most of which with evil slave labor, which is why people, you know, didn't want World Cup/Olympics or anything like that to ever be there.

396
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:20,130
Scott: So, it's pretty funny, I guess, in a, I don't know, in a haha kind of way, as in a haha-you-deserve-it kind of way.

397
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,408
Rym: In a cosmic justice irrespective of the local consequences way.

398
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:30,390
Scott: To see a ridiculous luxury hotel in Dubai go up in flames, and also a skyscraper in flames is not something you see every day.

399
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,288
Rym: Yeah, that does not really happen.

400
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,035
Scott: Usually, they're not flammable.

401
00:25:34,256 --> 00:25:35,480
Scott: They're not really made of wood.

402
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:38,670
Scott: You couldn't set, like, you couldn't even set my apartment building on fire.

403
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:42,809
Scott: You know, it's like someone's, one person's apartment would, like, burn out, and the sprinklers would put it out.

404
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:43,691
Scott: Right?

405
00:25:43,711 --> 00:25:47,870
Scott: So, it's like, yeah, I don't know how this got started.

406
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:52,570
Rym: Yep, I saw the stories about it, but other than noting that that happened, I didn't actually read any of the stories.

407
00:25:52,730 --> 00:26:02,927
Scott: So, this, I think, is a Russian or Eastern European photographer, and he happened to be in Dubai, and he saw this out the window, and everyone's like, "Well, I'm gonna take some photos, some video, and I'm gonna make a

408
00:26:02,987 --> 00:26:03,490
Scott: time-lapse.".

409
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:05,009
Scott: And he made this amazing time-lapse.

410
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:12,670
Rym: The fireballs coming out of the building are the most interesting part, because from the distance he's at, those things could not be small.

411
00:26:13,011 --> 00:26:18,490
Scott: The shot he's got shows, like, you know, the Burj Dubai next to the, you know, this hotel, which is, like, in the center of town.

412
00:26:19,191 --> 00:26:25,409
Scott: And it's like, "Well, it's pretty epic visuals that you will not see often, if

413
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:25,650
Scott: ever.".

414
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:32,590
Scott: So, in the meantime, we are going-- And the next time the fire alarm goes off in your hotel, will you think about actually leaving?

415
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,191
Scott: Nope.

416
00:26:33,814 --> 00:26:40,409
Rym: I'm gonna, you know what, I'm gonna take that risk, because let me tell you, the day I decided-- If you were in that hotel, though, you would have stayed in.

417
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:44,398
Rym: Yeah, and I think, you know, I will stay in the hotel.

418
00:26:44,498 --> 00:26:53,390
Rym: if the fire alarm goes off, unless I'm more than, I don't know, 50 stories up, then I might at least go out into the hallway and see if anyone else is leaving.

419
00:26:54,092 --> 00:27:00,186
Rym: But if I'm at a convention, and some motherfucker pulls the fire alarm, I am not going outside.

420
00:27:00,206 --> 00:27:01,970
Rym: I am just going back to sleep.

421
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,689
Scott: But don't go to a convention in Dubai.

422
00:27:04,531 --> 00:27:06,398
Rym: I would not go to Dubai if I could avoid it.

423
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:10,010
Rym: I'm generally avoiding those places lately for a lot of reasons.

424
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,250
Scott: Yeah, good idea.

425
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:15,904
Rym: So, in a moment, we are going to be at Pac South 2016.

426
00:27:15,904 --> 00:27:17,650
Rym: That shit's coming up real quick.

427
00:27:17,751 --> 00:27:18,889
Scott: It's, like, two or three weeks away.

428
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,371
Rym: Yeah.

429
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:22,158
Rym: Saturday, 1pm, Atari Game Design.

430
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:24,805
Rym: Saturday, 5.30pm, Scared Yet?

431
00:27:24,865 --> 00:27:26,570
Rym: A Discussion of Horror in Games.

432
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,703
Rym: Sunday, at 1pm, Designing Game Rules.

433
00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:32,630
Rym: All three of these are in the Bobcat Theater.

434
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,017
Rym: All three of these can be yours.

435
00:27:35,438 --> 00:27:41,909
Rym: Two of them involve Scott, and the third one involves a whole bunch of smart people, and I guess, somehow, I tricked my way to be on this thing, too.

436
00:27:42,993 --> 00:27:49,130
Rym: It's Chris Straub, it's Susan Art from GamesRadar, Dave Allen from Penny Arcade, and me.

437
00:27:50,431 --> 00:27:53,109
Scott: I'm going to find a way to play a ton of fucking games.

438
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:57,281
Rym: I feel like this is not the RPG packs.

439
00:27:57,361 --> 00:27:59,510
Rym: I feel like I want to play mostly German Euro this time.

440
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:16,030
Scott: Also, I've somehow ended up with a Netrunner tournament kit, so maybe I'll run an unofficial, unlicensed, you know, unsanctioned Netrunner tournament, if there are enough people at PAX South who will come at the time of my choosing.

441
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:17,777
Rym: Or, you know, actually, I was about to say...

442
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:20,010
Scott: And judging by that panel schedule, probably Sunday morning.

443
00:28:21,271 --> 00:28:27,650
Rym: Maybe it is the RPG con, because a lot of the RPG people we know tend to go to PAX South instead of the other PAXes.

444
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:31,681
Scott: We can do some RPG, perhaps some Burning Wheel plus Codex.

445
00:28:31,701 --> 00:28:34,610
Rym: Ooh, I could bring the one-off that I mostly finish running for you guys.

446
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:37,030
Scott: Chris, I don't think the Codex is going to be here by the end of the month, right?

447
00:28:37,152 --> 00:28:38,428
Rym: I'll go to Luke and be like, "Yo, can I have some design

448
00:28:38,448 --> 00:28:38,570
Rym: files?".

449
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,870
Scott: But I've got a lot of RPGs that we have not yet played.

450
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:43,178
Rym: Yeah, I've got The Warren.

451
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,630
Rym: I haven't even read The Warren yet.

452
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,332
Scott: That's a good one.

453
00:28:46,115 --> 00:28:50,770
Scott: I got Ryutama, which is like the JRPG of tabletop RPGs.

454
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:53,290
Rym: Yep, Emily has Night Witches, which we haven't played either.

455
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,150
Scott: Plenty RPGs to play.

456
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,502
Rym: So yeah, come to PAX South.

457
00:28:56,624 --> 00:28:57,210
Rym: All of this can be yours.

458
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:01,969
Rym: Also, apparently Chris Straub is going to have an unofficial event somewhere Saturday night.

459
00:29:02,735 --> 00:29:04,429
Rym: It's an ELO roundtable.

460
00:29:06,192 --> 00:29:07,501
Rym: As in, ELO.

461
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:08,669
Rym: The ELO you're thinking of.

462
00:29:09,235 --> 00:29:10,070
Scott: The ranking system?

463
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,410
Rym: No, Electra Like Orchestra.

464
00:29:15,031 --> 00:29:16,986
Rym: He's making a big deal about how he wants to do this.

465
00:29:17,026 --> 00:29:17,469
Rym: I don't know why.

466
00:29:19,072 --> 00:29:20,480
Rym: All these people are tweeting like, "Wait, you mean...".

467
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,867
Rym: And he's like, "Yeah, so we'll

468
00:29:21,907 --> 00:29:21,968
Rym: see.".

469
00:29:22,695 --> 00:29:23,368
Scott: Which one, though?

470
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:24,974
Rym: All of them.

471
00:29:25,135 --> 00:29:27,830
Rym: Everything that can be held under the banner of ELO.

472
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,890
Scott: So both rankings and awesome music?

473
00:29:30,112 --> 00:29:31,928
Rym: No, all the music of ELO.

474
00:29:32,911 --> 00:29:35,584
Rym: And all the iterations of EL and all the people related to it.

475
00:29:37,433 --> 00:29:37,996
Scott: So the music.

476
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:39,990
Scott: He doesn't care about ranking chess players.

477
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:44,610
Rym: No, though it would be funny if enough of us showed up at the thing and only wanted to talk about ranking chess players.

478
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:51,170
Rym: Every year I play a game that I hate, and every year I either win or almost win.

479
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:56,770
Rym: And sure enough, this year again, I won like $400 in fantasy football at my company.

480
00:29:57,092 --> 00:29:58,469
Scott: It's not a hard game to win.

481
00:29:58,831 --> 00:30:14,630
Rym: Even though they all took it super seriously, and all I did was every day I logged in once, I looked at who had the best projection numbers, and I used my waivers and nonsense to get whatever players I could, made the statistically maximum team, and then didn't touch it again.

482
00:30:15,211 --> 00:30:20,810
Rym: I made no trades, I made 29 acquisitions, and I won.

483
00:30:21,532 --> 00:30:22,409
Rym: I got a pile of money.

484
00:30:23,851 --> 00:30:33,890
Rym: The only thing that was interesting is that for all they're paying attention and not paying attention to the stats, I did way worse this year than I'd ever done because they changed the way the beginning worked.

485
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:42,210
Rym: Usually people just do the auction, but my company, I think they all caught on to the fact that I kind of manipulated them in the auction every year.

486
00:30:42,692 --> 00:30:45,090
Rym: So they changed it to the snake so I couldn't mess with them.

487
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,569
Scott: How does the snake work?

488
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,250
Rym: So the snake works, it's Settlers of Catan.

489
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:51,509
Rym: So start with player one, just go back and forth.

490
00:30:51,752 --> 00:30:52,609
Scott: That's why it's a snake.

491
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,669
Rym: Yes, back and forth, back and forth.

492
00:30:54,934 --> 00:30:55,450
Scott: That's not bad.

493
00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:07,390
Rym: But what it meant was instead of having all the good players because no one knows how to bid on things or value things in any degree in the real world, I actually had a pretty average team, as did everyone.

494
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:08,668
Scott: That's how a snake's gonna be.

495
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,528
Rym: Yeah, still won though.

496
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:24,030
Rym: But in the last game, because the Seahawks clinched a while ago, so they had two games left where- Who's gonna get put on the field in a game that doesn't matter?

497
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,470
Scott: Who's gonna try in a game that doesn't matter?

498
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:30,810
Scott: It's like you got a team that's clinched against a team that can't make the playoffs.

499
00:31:31,553 --> 00:31:33,650
Scott: They have to play football, right?

500
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,250
Scott: It's like, you know, what's gonna happen?

501
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:40,409
Rym: The whole game is like the last three minutes of a hockey game where a team's down by five.

502
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,308
Rym: It's just, alright, what's gonna go on?

503
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:46,990
Rym: So almost my whole team was Seahawks, like four of my players.

504
00:31:48,055 --> 00:31:49,230
Rym: And I was winning because of that.

505
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,190
Scott: You gotta find teams that still have something to play for.

506
00:31:51,311 --> 00:31:51,917
Rym: Oh, no, no, no.

507
00:31:51,957 --> 00:31:52,968
Rym: So they clinched it.

508
00:31:54,011 --> 00:31:58,370
Rym: So I actually acquired more Seahawks because everyone else was ditching them.

509
00:31:59,172 --> 00:32:13,650
Rym: And I assumed that because of the way that fandom is, the Seahawks fandom, and because of the way Russell Wilson is, because he was close to some NFL records and some other stuff, I assumed they were gonna play full-on post-clinch.

510
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:15,149
Rym: And they did.

511
00:32:15,831 --> 00:32:19,010
Rym: So I got a lot of fantasy points.

512
00:32:19,993 --> 00:32:21,049
Rym: Fantasy football's kind of boring.

513
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:31,610
Scott: Yeah, I mean, despite being on break for a long time, I played a bunch of games, but Rym didn't really play any of the games that I played.

514
00:32:31,831 --> 00:32:37,650
Scott: I played a ton of games, but I played-- And also we played a lot of games that we had already played and already talked about on GeekNights before.

515
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,048
Rym: Yup, and I don't have a lot new--.

516
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:48,770
Rym: Well, it's interesting, though, because like TowerFall, I have watched-- I've been seeing tons of people who are gamers or not that much into gaming be introduced to TowerFall.

517
00:32:49,171 --> 00:32:54,110
Rym: I've seen different people teach it to them in different ways, introduce it to them in different ways.

518
00:32:55,371 --> 00:33:05,970
Rym: I've seen pretty much the full scope, and while I have a lot to say about that, I'm pretty much gonna pull all that into our learning games panel that we're gonna do probably at PAX East.

519
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:08,649
Scott: We already did an episode on that game.

520
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:24,848
Rym: Yeah, but that game was very instructive for me, because it's one of the few times I've seen a relatively simple game like that taught and introduced by many different people to many different other people, seen some players go through the progression through mastery, other players drop it immediately because they hate it.

521
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:30,870
Rym: Who got into it, who didn't get into it was-- Some surprising trends actually appeared.

522
00:33:31,451 --> 00:33:35,190
Rym: So TowerFall was interesting in that regard.

523
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,389
Rym: Also, I really like it, and I'm really good at it now.

524
00:33:38,551 --> 00:33:44,980
Scott: So one of the games that I played that Rym didn't play is something that was really cheap in the Steam sale, called Risk of Rain.

525
00:33:45,261 --> 00:33:46,630
Scott: I'm not sure why it's called that.

526
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,070
Rym: Rain like the rain of Alexander the Great?

527
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:49,977
Scott: No, rain like shh.

528
00:33:52,153 --> 00:33:53,029
Scott: Water falling from the sky.

529
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:54,980
Rym: I think I own it.

530
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,830
Rym: I just haven't played it.

531
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:56,393
Scott: Maybe.

532
00:33:56,816 --> 00:33:58,910
Scott: I didn't know what the game was, but I'd heard of it a bunch.

533
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,404
Scott: It was one of those popular indie games.

534
00:34:00,424 --> 00:34:01,010
Scott: It was super cheap.

535
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,676
Scott: So I'm like, "I got nothing to do.

536
00:34:02,756 --> 00:34:03,178
Scott: I'm home.

537
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,264
Scott: I'm not working.

538
00:34:04,384 --> 00:34:05,349
Scott: Let's relax with a nice

539
00:34:05,389 --> 00:34:05,490
Scott: game.".

540
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:10,710
Scott: So this game is a platforming, shooting, roguelike game.

541
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:16,090
Scott: So you get put on this partially procedurally generated map.

542
00:34:16,733 --> 00:34:18,181
Scott: You're a little tiny dude.

543
00:34:18,202 --> 00:34:19,489
Scott: You have guns.

544
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,489
Scott: There's four different moves.

545
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:26,228
Scott: One of the moves, you use all four trigger buttons to do your moves, right?

546
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:30,110
Scott: So it's like R2 is your regular attack.

547
00:34:30,514 --> 00:34:32,110
Scott: Then you got two special attacks.

548
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:40,050
Scott: Usually one of them hits a bunch of guys and shoots through them, and one of them is a slow but single power shot.

549
00:34:40,492 --> 00:34:43,949
Scott: And then everyone has sort of a movement, defensive kind of move.

550
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:46,369
Scott: So depending on the character you choose, these moves are slightly different.

551
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:55,188
Scott: And the defensive move will be like the ninja guy sort of puts smoke on himself and can be invisible for a little while.

552
00:34:55,931 --> 00:35:00,270
Scott: The basic guy just runs really fast and can sort of do a roll and a flip to get out of the way.

553
00:35:01,255 --> 00:35:02,148
Scott: You know, stuff like that.

554
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,848
Scott: There's one guy who puts a shield up.

555
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,329
Scott: He's like a riot trooper.

556
00:35:06,895 --> 00:35:07,850
Scott: And you're this little tiny guy.

557
00:35:08,211 --> 00:35:14,530
Scott: You go around this platforming map, left and right, up and down ladders, jumping from platforms, killing bad guys.

558
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:17,030
Scott: And when you kill bad guys, they spit out XP and gold.

559
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:21,590
Scott: And one really good thing the game does is that XP and gold just comes right to you.

560
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,788
Scott: You don't got to go over there and get it.

561
00:35:23,011 --> 00:35:23,919
Scott: You don't got to collect it.

562
00:35:23,939 --> 00:35:24,524
Scott: You don't got to do shit.

563
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,210
Scott: You just kill the guy.

564
00:35:25,271 --> 00:35:25,888
Rym: Good job, guys.

565
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:34,150
Scott: And then, you know, there's stuff around like, you know, treasure chests and items to buy with gold and stuff just lying on the ground.

566
00:35:35,373 --> 00:35:36,406
Scott: It's like a roguelike, you know.

567
00:35:38,514 --> 00:35:39,929
Scott: And it's highly skill based, right?

568
00:35:40,751 --> 00:35:44,710
Scott: Bad guys have certain attack patterns and you can figure out ways to kill them from relative safety.

569
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:47,209
Scott: You level up, you get more powerful, you get more items.

570
00:35:47,811 --> 00:35:49,550
Scott: Mostly the items are what make you more powerful.

571
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,888
Scott: Leveling up doesn't do much at all.

572
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:54,190
Scott: And as you level up, bad guys get more dangerous.

573
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:56,010
Scott: And you're trying to get to the exit of a level.

574
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,650
Scott: To get to the exit, you have to activate this teleporter.

575
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:04,170
Scott: And when you activate the teleporter, you then have to survive for 90 seconds without dying.

576
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:07,470
Scott: And during those 90 seconds, it spawns hella enemies everywhere.

577
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:12,230
Rym: So it's like half of the mini boss battle scenes in Human Revolution.

578
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:15,090
Scott: Including at least one ridiculous boss enemy.

579
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:20,809
Rym: Hit the door to activate the elevator and then hide and survive for like 20 minutes while the guys come and try to find you.

580
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:27,130
Scott: Nope, because even when the 90 seconds ends, you can't go in the teleporter until you then completely clear the map of enemies.

581
00:36:28,296 --> 00:36:29,990
Scott: Then you go in the teleporter to go to the next level.

582
00:36:30,373 --> 00:36:32,190
Scott: And I guess you just keep doing that.

583
00:36:33,172 --> 00:36:36,250
Scott: On easy mode, I was able to get to like 5 or 6 levels through.

584
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:39,469
Scott: And it didn't end really, so I'm not sure if there is an end.

585
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:48,409
Scott: On normal difficulty, it was so ridiculously hard because the exp and gold payout was so low, you couldn't really get all the items.

586
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:50,989
Scott: And if you tried to farm, you would level up.

587
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:54,270
Scott: And then the bad guys would get too hard at too rapid a pace.

588
00:36:54,490 --> 00:37:00,649
Scott: So even when you went to the next level, I couldn't really figure out how to properly scale my play.

589
00:37:01,952 --> 00:37:03,490
Scott: Should I just rush into level 2?

590
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:09,450
Scott: But when I tried to rush into level 2, and I activated the teleporter as quickly as possible, I wasn't strong enough to survive for 90 seconds.

591
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,270
Scott: And I just died, I couldn't make it to level 2.

592
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,250
Rym: You know what other game has that real hard decision?

593
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:20,930
Rym: It's NecroDancer, because you can go faster to avoid fights, but then you get less stuff, which makes the later parts even harder.

594
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:24,510
Rym: But if you stick around getting all the stuff, you might end up having no health.

595
00:37:24,854 --> 00:37:28,570
Scott: I think the biggest problem in this game is simply the fact that they made everything hella small.

596
00:37:29,031 --> 00:37:33,410
Scott: It's like this big ol' screen, and you're this little tiny dude, and everything else is relatively tiny.

597
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:36,450
Rym: Oh shit, that reminds me, we forgot to play Scorched Earth at the party.

598
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:36,933
Scott: I know.

599
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:43,370
Scott: Everything's hella tiny, and a lot of times I died, it's just because I would be stuck in a mess of bad guys.

600
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,949
Scott: And it's like, well I can't really see what the fuck's going on in there, can I?

601
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:59,489
Scott: And I feel like if you made a game with the same exact concept, platforming, roguelike, really similar, but instead of having this little tiny fucking thing, it was big, like Super Metroid big, that would be a fucking amazing game.

602
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,810
Rym: Ooh, Scott, we never did an episode on Scorched Earth.

603
00:38:03,332 --> 00:38:04,209
Scott: Well, maybe we should.

604
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:07,229
Rym: Let's livestream us playing it first, and then...

605
00:38:08,294 --> 00:38:09,189
Scott: That's all you, get it to work.

606
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,348
Rym: I will, I'll figure it out.

607
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:15,030
Rym: My problem, my worry is that with Scorched Earth, we're gonna play it on a modern resolution.

608
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,025
Rym: That game's made for like a 320x200.

609
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:17,558
Scott: We'll play it at 640x480.

610
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:19,545
Rym: No, let's play it at...

611
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:20,175
Scott: Or 800x600, at most.

612
00:38:21,571 --> 00:38:26,490
Rym: Let's play it on your iPad and Retina, pixel versus pixel across a sea, desert.

613
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:32,910
Rym: So, Emily picked up a game, Motainai, which is another Shuddock game.

614
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,671
Scott: It's Glory to Rome 3.0.

615
00:38:34,671 --> 00:38:37,890
Rym: Yeah, Shuddock keeps trying to make the same game over and over again.

616
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:42,028
Scott: That was Glory to Rome, then there was Glory to Rome, same game, better art, then there was Euchronia.

617
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,227
Rym: Which is bad, but...

618
00:38:43,411 --> 00:38:44,850
Scott: And then there was Motainai.

619
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,110
Rym: Now there's also innovation.

620
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:49,589
Scott: That's not Glory to Rome 1, 2, or 3.0, it's a separate game.

621
00:38:49,892 --> 00:38:52,729
Rym: So, I didn't play Motainai yet, but I read the rules.

622
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,189
Rym: Emily played it, Scott played it.

623
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,509
Scott: I played it one or two times.

624
00:38:55,750 --> 00:39:01,030
Rym: And a bunch of our board gamer friends played it like a hundred times and got obsessed with it over the weekend.

625
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,389
Scott: Not a hundred times, but they played it a lot.

626
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,730
Rym: Yeah, they played it a lot.

627
00:39:04,371 --> 00:39:05,270
Rym: They played it all night.

628
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:13,130
Rym: And the thing is, this isn't a full review now, but what's interesting about it is that it's designed for two or three players.

629
00:39:14,734 --> 00:39:15,789
Scott: I don't know about that.

630
00:39:16,492 --> 00:39:19,770
Rym: He says that in the rules, and that seems to be true.

631
00:39:20,938 --> 00:39:22,230
Rym: It includes two identical decks.

632
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:23,888
Rym: So you play it with two or three.

633
00:39:24,692 --> 00:39:26,509
Rym: If you want to play with four or five...

634
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:27,490
Scott: You put in a second deck.

635
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:32,410
Rym: You shuffle the second identical deck in and the game takes like seven times longer.

636
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,830
Scott: It didn't take seven times longer when he played with two decks.

637
00:39:34,871 --> 00:39:39,182
Rym: Well, you're also supposed to, according to the rules, increase the count.

638
00:39:39,203 --> 00:39:40,370
Rym: that ends the game by one.

639
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:40,910
Scott: By one?

640
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,930
Scott: That didn't make it last longer at all.

641
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,070
Rym: Well, you only played one game.

642
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:45,210
Rym: Everyone has played a lot more games.

643
00:39:45,231 --> 00:39:45,769
Scott: I played it twice.

644
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:46,423
Scott: Yeah.

645
00:39:46,815 --> 00:39:50,130
Scott: Yeah, so, I mean, I'm not that into Glory to Rome.

646
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:51,490
Scott: I'm even less into Motainai.

647
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,550
Scott: It's a game where like the game ended so rapidly.

648
00:39:55,854 --> 00:39:58,729
Scott: Both times I played, the game ended like right before my turn.

649
00:39:59,551 --> 00:40:02,788
Scott: And it was just like I had maybe two, three turns and the game was over.

650
00:40:03,311 --> 00:40:04,627
Scott: There really wasn't anything to do.

651
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:05,670
Scott: Which is interesting.

652
00:40:05,992 --> 00:40:08,310
Rym: I see it like a distilled version of Glory to Rome.

653
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:18,810
Rym: If you play that kind of game, but instead of a lot of diffuse decisions that culminate into a machine, it's what can I do in a few turns based on what everyone else is doing?

654
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,590
Rym: It's deeply reactive, which is a lot like innovation.

655
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:32,790
Scott: Yeah, but it's like, I mean, a game where you have, you know, all this stuff to like, you know, usually when you play a board game, it's like, it doesn't have to be long, but it's like you want to, you know, you start with nothing.

656
00:40:33,273 --> 00:40:39,430
Scott: You want to build a little machine and then you want to crank that machine one or two times and you sort of see who built the best machine.

657
00:40:39,531 --> 00:40:43,048
Scott: And this, it's like turn one, play some stuff.

658
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,510
Scott: Turn two, get a little bit more stuff.

659
00:40:45,751 --> 00:40:48,670
Scott: If you're lucky, turn three, maybe score some points and it's over.

660
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:49,709
Rym: You know what it's almost more like?

661
00:40:50,032 --> 00:40:51,150
Rym: It's almost more like Dominion.

662
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,402
Rym: Everyone looks at it and says,

663
00:40:52,422 --> 00:40:52,462
Rym: "Go!"

664
00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:55,470
Rym: And then whoever says, "I got it," wins.

665
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:56,610
Rym: It's like whoever figures it out.

666
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:59,230
Scott: I made so few decisions in each game.

667
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:00,530
Rym: And each one was devastating.

668
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:05,269
Scott: And it's like there really weren't, you know, a lot of choices.

669
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,990
Scott: It wasn't very interesting choices that I made either.

670
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,348
Scott: It was sort of like, well, I got my hand.

671
00:41:09,771 --> 00:41:11,809
Scott: I'll do the best I can do with the hand I've got.

672
00:41:12,991 --> 00:41:14,129
Scott: And okay, the end.

673
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,910
Scott: And it's just like that was really deeply unsatisfying.

674
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:18,089
Rym: But at the same time...

675
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:24,708
Scott: If the game went on longer, it might have been just as good as Glory to Rome where it's like, "Okay, I can build a little thing, get some stuff going on, do some

676
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:24,910
Scott: cranking.".

677
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:25,474
Rym: See, that's it.

678
00:41:25,514 --> 00:41:30,342
Rym: Glory to Rome has a long crank cycle and this has more of the like.

679
00:41:30,764 --> 00:41:33,090
Rym: immediate decision, short crank factor matters.

680
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,510
Scott: But you don't even crank.

681
00:41:34,891 --> 00:41:37,490
Scott: It's like almost nothing happened.

682
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,087
Scott: The game ended.

683
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:38,889
Rym: Yeah, exactly.

684
00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:41,128
Scott: I really don't understand why people like it.

685
00:41:41,491 --> 00:41:50,768
Rym: So interviewing our friends who are gamers who played the shit out of it at the party, their sentiments were that one, none of them had that problem except you.

686
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:55,970
Rym: And two, that it was satisfying because it was so quick.

687
00:41:56,070 --> 00:42:02,849
Rym: Once you had some fluency in the game, you could just bang the game out in 15 minutes, be done and have had a short, satisfying experience and move on.

688
00:42:03,171 --> 00:42:04,349
Scott: It was very definitely short.

689
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:05,430
Scott: It wasn't satisfying.

690
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:10,810
Rym: But the reason why I think you hate it because I hate innovation and I love Glory to Rome.

691
00:42:11,234 --> 00:42:14,609
Rym: You're okay with Glory to Rome and you also hate innovation right alongside me.

692
00:42:14,811 --> 00:42:15,945
Scott: Yeah, innovation's bad game.

693
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:18,829
Rym: This game is Glory to Rome x innovation in a lot of ways.

694
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:21,010
Scott: I didn't really see the innovation aspect in it.

695
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:33,470
Rym: No, in the sense that Glory to Rome, because there's so many more actions and your influence is a little more diffuse, you don't need to know all the cards in the game and what they do to play pretty competently in Glory to Rome.

696
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:37,789
Rym: You need to know what a few of the big ones do and otherwise you can kind of just wing it.

697
00:42:38,491 --> 00:42:41,630
Rym: You don't even need to pay that much attention to the buildings other people are building.

698
00:42:42,252 --> 00:42:49,130
Scott: One thing I did like about Motainai that I don't like about Glory to Rome is that in Motainai, you're actually taking freaking turns.

699
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,230
Scott: In Glory to Rome, everyone plays simultaneously.

700
00:42:51,510 --> 00:43:02,329
Scott: You can't really pay too much attention to what everyone else is... But in Motainai, you can perfectly follow everything that everyone's doing because they're all taking turns one at a time.

701
00:43:03,371 --> 00:43:04,137
Scott: So it's like, "Aha!

702
00:43:04,178 --> 00:43:05,448
Scott: I can see what the hell's going on

703
00:43:05,509 --> 00:43:05,650
Scott: here.".

704
00:43:05,711 --> 00:43:21,989
Rym: I guess in terms of the puzzle feel, like watching people play, the brain feel of the game reminds me of One Night Ultimate Werewolf, where there's a huge setup and everyone looks at their stuff, stares at each other for a while, and then makes a few moves.

705
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:27,189
Scott: The other problem is that modern game design, things like Ticket to Ride, is all about.

706
00:43:27,774 --> 00:43:31,470
Scott: on your turn, you do something small and the turns go around really quickly.

707
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:44,490
Scott: Motainai sort of undoes that and goes back to really old-school design where one person does a whole ton of shit on their turn and then you sit during everyone else's turn doing fuck-all, waiting and being pissed off.

708
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:50,770
Rym: But that gets around the problem you just said you had with Glory to Rome, where everyone acts simultaneously, so it's hard to keep track of what they're all doing.

709
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:52,465
Rym: Because this game, because there's so few decisions...

710
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:58,749
Scott: I think the ideal would be, you still take turns, but you do a little bit on your turn and take a lot more turns.

711
00:43:58,991 --> 00:44:01,190
Scott: That's a modern design that's more enjoyable.

712
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:02,527
Scott: Less waiting.

713
00:44:03,114 --> 00:44:05,310
Rym: But the game's only 15 minutes, how much waiting could it have been?

714
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:07,310
Rym: You spent more time waiting in that Hansa game.

715
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:08,969
Scott: I'm saying most of the game was waiting.

716
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:12,390
Scott: My turn took like a few seconds and the rest of the 15 minutes was waiting.

717
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:13,510
Scott: I only got like three turns.

718
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:19,470
Rym: And you spend most of that turn, when other people are taking their turns, watching everything they're doing and reconstructing the model of how the game's gonna play out in your head.

719
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:24,050
Scott: I'd rather have more shorter turns than few long turns.

720
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:27,450
Rym: Anyway, we assumed you wouldn't like the game based on its lineage.

721
00:44:28,473 --> 00:44:31,793
Rym: I'm gonna play it a whole bunch, two or three player, and we'll have a review once.

722
00:44:31,914 --> 00:44:36,667
Rym: I fully grok it, because I do not grok it enough to speak to whether it's actually good or bad.

723
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:40,729
Rym: But the overwhelming sentiment of our friends was that it was good, except Scott.

724
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:47,803
Rym: We played, actually, a bunch of LAN party Rocket League, because our friends had two PS4s.

725
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:50,570
Scott: Rocket League is a great game.

726
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:54,430
Scott: The only reason I stopped playing it every freaking day is because of the matchmaking problem.

727
00:44:54,691 --> 00:45:04,389
Scott: So I couldn't get a game where either A) there was someone who just dominated me and I was useless, or B) I was the best, and it was pointless to play because no one was competing with me.

728
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:08,310
Rym: It is interesting how heavily that skilled golf factor...

729
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:12,549
Scott: And even at this party where you had a LAN air hockey problem big time.

730
00:45:13,414 --> 00:45:14,730
Scott: If I was on a team, it won.

731
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:17,067
Scott: I just put the ball in whenever I wanted to.

732
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:21,329
Rym: Yep, but then you weren't playing and the rest of us played, and the games were closer.

733
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:25,168
Rym: But there was a pretty good, like, me and Adam and Alex...

734
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:27,049
Scott: Well, Adam has played it, because he has it.

735
00:45:28,501 --> 00:45:30,309
Scott: You and Adam played it about as much as each other.

736
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:32,810
Scott: Alex had played it a little bit as well.

737
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:35,029
Scott: I've seen him play it on Steam.

738
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:36,609
Scott: I've seen his name come up.

739
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:38,990
Scott: Well, they play it a lot, right?

740
00:45:39,735 --> 00:45:41,829
Scott: They were like one or two tiers above you.

741
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:42,745
Rym: Yeah, they were.

742
00:45:43,432 --> 00:45:56,690
Rym: That's why I started... Strategy aside, but it is interesting that even when there's skilled golfs when you're playing with friends in the same building and next to each other it's pretty fun even when one player is kind of dominant.

743
00:45:56,973 --> 00:46:08,102
Rym: There's this moment where Scott made this beautiful pass and we saw that the ball was going to go in, and we saw a defender jump to be ready to go after it, and then we hear,

744
00:46:08,122 --> 00:46:08,162
Rym: "Ah!"

745
00:46:09,192 --> 00:46:12,548
Rym: in the other room as we see them barely miss the ball.

746
00:46:12,971 --> 00:46:13,557
Scott: Right.

747
00:46:13,962 --> 00:46:14,669
Scott: It's still fun.

748
00:46:15,875 --> 00:46:19,164
Scott: It's just disappointing when there's the air hockey problem.

749
00:46:20,433 --> 00:46:21,850
Scott: I would play some Street Fighter.

750
00:46:22,331 --> 00:46:27,039
Scott: Me and Rym, it's like, "I'm better at Street Fighter and I'll win," and it'll still be kind of fun.

751
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:27,242
Scott: Why?

752
00:46:27,343 --> 00:46:27,829
Scott: No, it's not.

753
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:29,890
Rym: Playing Street Fighter between the two of us is not fun at all.

754
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:30,769
Rym: I barely get a hit in.

755
00:46:31,871 --> 00:46:32,819
Rym: There's no contest.

756
00:46:32,859 --> 00:46:34,150
Scott: Well, maybe it's not fun for you.

757
00:46:34,772 --> 00:46:37,227
Rym: It's fun for you to just decide when to end me.

758
00:46:38,691 --> 00:46:48,513
Scott: But at least in Rocket League it's even more fun than that because you have this team aspect where even though I'm dominating because I've played it only because I've played it more hours than everyone else.

759
00:46:48,654 --> 00:46:52,274
Rym: We've got to put Scott on a team with two bad people against a more moderately competent team.

760
00:46:52,294 --> 00:46:53,284
Scott: Not for any other reason.

761
00:46:53,405 --> 00:46:55,444
Scott: I still have to depend on the other people on my team.

762
00:46:55,484 --> 00:46:58,868
Scott: It's like I can't score and defend the goal at the same time.

763
00:46:59,971 --> 00:47:06,334
Scott: When I was forced to go down and try to score, it's like people were scoring goals on us because I couldn't also defend.

764
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:10,332
Scott: I could just try to get down there as fast as I could and sometimes I couldn't, but sometimes I couldn't.

765
00:47:10,353 --> 00:47:13,949
Rym: What was really cool, though, was that everyone who sat down...

766
00:47:14,253 --> 00:47:15,710
Scott: I'm not like a god of Rocket League.

767
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:18,293
Scott: I just played it more than everyone else.

768
00:47:18,313 --> 00:47:20,598
Scott: I was slightly better enough that I could reliably...

769
00:47:20,618 --> 00:47:23,129
Rym: A lot of our friends had never played it before.

770
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:28,910
Rym: When we set it up and had it going just three on three, people just kept playing.

771
00:47:29,952 --> 00:47:33,850
Rym: People were having a lot of fun even when they were on the team that you were crushing.

772
00:47:34,813 --> 00:47:39,550
Rym: Everyone was just super into it the whole time, which is very telling to the fun of Rocket League.

773
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:40,174
Rym: It's really fun.

774
00:47:40,194 --> 00:47:46,130
Scott: I was trying to give people advice and help them out with the little bit of knowledge that I have.

775
00:47:46,712 --> 00:47:49,001
Scott: Don't waste your boost just going on the ground.

776
00:47:49,142 --> 00:47:55,689
Scott: You just flip and keep your car in between the ball and the net, but some people just didn't want to hear it.

777
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:56,375
Scott: I'm like, "Why?

778
00:47:56,396 --> 00:48:00,172
Scott: If you were a god of Rocket League, I want to hear every fucking thing you have to

779
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:00,637
Scott: say.".

780
00:48:00,738 --> 00:48:02,192
Rym: Yeah, but they say, "Oh, just do an

781
00:48:02,293 --> 00:48:02,576
Rym: aerial.".

782
00:48:02,616 --> 00:48:02,859
Rym: You're like,

783
00:48:02,899 --> 00:48:03,101
Rym: "How?".

784
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:11,081
Scott: Well, if they were actually there, I could ask them, "Hey, should I hold the stick back now?

785
00:48:11,142 --> 00:48:12,416
Scott: or when do I push the boost?

786
00:48:12,436 --> 00:48:12,964
Scott: How much do I...".

787
00:48:13,571 --> 00:48:15,490
Scott: I could get those questions answered.

788
00:48:16,495 --> 00:48:17,528
Rym: We were doing all this on PS4.

789
00:48:17,971 --> 00:48:18,984
Rym: I had my laptops.

790
00:48:19,005 --> 00:48:20,482
Rym: I was just playing Rocket League on my laptop.

791
00:48:20,583 --> 00:48:21,250
Rym: I just joined the game.

792
00:48:21,451 --> 00:48:22,298
Rym: I had a private screen.

793
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,278
Scott: How high can you put the settings on your laptop?

794
00:48:24,379 --> 00:48:24,964
Rym: It looked fine.

795
00:48:25,005 --> 00:48:28,136
Rym: I turned off the dynamic shadows and it pretty much looked great.

796
00:48:28,984 --> 00:48:29,367
Rym: I got an X230.

797
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:31,244
Rym: It's got a Core i7 in it.

798
00:48:31,285 --> 00:48:32,742
Rym: That integrated video is no slouch.

799
00:48:33,086 --> 00:48:34,749
Scott: Integrated video is the biggest slouch.

800
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:38,541
Rym: It's Intel's good integrated video.

801
00:48:38,602 --> 00:48:40,096
Scott: There's no such thing, first of all.

802
00:48:40,156 --> 00:48:43,269
Rym: Scott, that laptop can play Counter-Strike just fine.

803
00:48:44,734 --> 00:48:46,708
Scott: I have the settings all the way up at home.

804
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:51,798
Rym: It didn't need to be all the way up because the resolution on that monitor is 13 whatever.

805
00:48:53,772 --> 00:48:55,939
Rym: It's not the most high-resolution laptop.

806
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:56,730
Scott: I'm just saying.

807
00:48:58,571 --> 00:49:00,662
Rym: But we were using PS4s.

808
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:02,790
Scott: I don't like the PS4 controller.

809
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:05,836
Scott: It's not awful, but I still don't like the stupid D-pad.

810
00:49:05,856 --> 00:49:08,530
Rym: I guess I didn't have to deal with that because I was using my Xbox controller.

811
00:49:09,592 --> 00:49:15,875
Scott: In Rocket League, I didn't have to use the D-pad, so it wasn't really a problem, but in games where the D-pad came into play, it was a problem.

812
00:49:15,936 --> 00:49:19,776
Rym: But the PS4 is pretty inferior to an HEPC.

813
00:49:19,817 --> 00:49:21,290
Rym: It's super inferior.

814
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:27,429
Rym: Do you know how many times someone would be playing TowerFall in one room and then someone else joins Rocket League in the other room?

815
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:35,388
Rym: But then they log in on the controller, and it happened to have been logged into the other room before, so it stops the other game and ruins it.

816
00:49:36,114 --> 00:49:38,463
Rym: And that happened back and forth the entire party.

817
00:49:38,705 --> 00:49:42,481
Rym: For some reason, the PS4, if you join a game of TowerFall, it's like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa,

818
00:49:42,501 --> 00:49:42,664
Rym: whoa!".

819
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:43,938
Rym: You can't just play.

820
00:49:44,362 --> 00:49:46,769
Rym: You've got to make an account and do all this nonsense.

821
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:51,735
Rym: On an HEPC, you just plug four controllers in and hit start, and it just works.

822
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:54,910
Rym: The PS4 has way too much overhead in it.

823
00:49:55,150 --> 00:50:01,485
Scott: Not to mention, there were three or four people who had PlayStation accounts, because they had to own the game to play it.

824
00:50:03,775 --> 00:50:05,149
Scott: Some of them owned it, and some of them didn't.

825
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:08,809
Scott: I don't know, but you go to one PS4 and you'd log in as Phil.

826
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:16,905
Scott: And you go to the other PS4, and if someone logged in as Phil on that one to play a game Phil owned, then you'd get logged out completely of the other PS4.

827
00:50:16,965 --> 00:50:18,297
Scott: And it's like, "What the hell?

828
00:50:18,439 --> 00:50:22,423
Scott: I can log into my Steam account on a whole bunch of computers, as long as I legit log

829
00:50:22,564 --> 00:50:22,665
Scott: in.".

830
00:50:23,472 --> 00:50:28,464
Scott: And as long as they're not playing the exact same game at the same time, Steam is like, "Alright, you logged in.

831
00:50:28,565 --> 00:50:28,869
Scott: It's you.

832
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:32,298
Scott: You typed in your Steam Guard one-time code and everything.

833
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:33,045
Scott: You're

834
00:50:33,126 --> 00:50:33,348
Scott: cool.".

835
00:50:33,752 --> 00:50:37,649
Scott: As long as you don't want to play TowerFall on two computers at once, we're not gonna stop you.

836
00:50:38,392 --> 00:50:43,855
Scott: In my house, I could load up Counter-Strike on my computer, and I could load up, you know, what else is on Steam?

837
00:50:44,118 --> 00:50:47,050
Scott: Civ 5 on my HDPC, and it'll be like, "Okay.

838
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:48,151
Scott: No

839
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:48,498
Scott: problem.".

840
00:50:49,191 --> 00:51:00,529
Rym: So, this was the first time also this party that all of us, or many of us, who are in this human versus human, giant Civ 5 game with GMR, we're in the same room together.

841
00:51:02,054 --> 00:51:04,041
Scott: There are three or so people not there.

842
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:04,142
Scott: Yeah.

843
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:09,110
Rym: So, a lot of backdoor dealings and discussion happened.

844
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:10,240
Scott: I didn't make any dealings.

845
00:51:10,583 --> 00:51:11,558
Rym: I made a lot of dealings.

846
00:51:11,641 --> 00:51:11,928
Rym: Okay.

847
00:51:13,151 --> 00:51:14,038
Rym: Deal away.

848
00:51:14,402 --> 00:51:22,689
Rym: We'll probably do a show on this later, because we gotta finish this game first or fully grok it, but if you've ever wanted, like, if you play Civ 5, it's a fun game, or any Civ game.

849
00:51:23,733 --> 00:51:29,469
Rym: Civ 5, where all the other players are human, is such a different game.

850
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:32,423
Scott: Well, simply just because the real-world time it takes.

851
00:51:32,443 --> 00:51:34,281
Scott: You're not just pressing enter, enter, enter, enter, enter.

852
00:51:34,302 --> 00:51:35,614
Scott: You get to think about every turn.

853
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:39,858
Rym: That's one aspect of it, but the second aspect is, it's a human.

854
00:51:39,898 --> 00:51:53,596
Rym: When I see one lone archer and a horseman in the distance come into my field of view nearby, and I see that it's from, say, England, I gotta think real hard about what the person playing England is thinking.

855
00:51:53,616 --> 00:51:58,730
Rym: Are they actually gonna declare war on me and steal that worker that's out working the colonies?

856
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,050
Rym: Can I risk that?

857
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:01,790
Scott: Yes, that's what's going to happen.

858
00:52:02,632 --> 00:52:07,797
Rym: So, it's this really steely-eyed, stare-down game.

859
00:52:07,878 --> 00:52:11,637
Scott: It's a political game, as opposed to a "how well can you manipulate this AI

860
00:52:11,678 --> 00:52:11,981
Scott: game?".

861
00:52:12,001 --> 00:52:12,406
Rym: No!

862
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:14,330
Rym: It is not actually that political.

863
00:52:15,372 --> 00:52:18,365
Scott: It is if someone gets enough power to make it political.

864
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:34,450
Rym: But even then, the difference is the politicality of a Civ 5 game, because I've been playing other of these games with other sets of people for a while now, is that, sure, politics could be a factor, except there's a long period in the beginning where there is very little you can actually do to your opponents.

865
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:36,250
Rym: You're almost like all playing versus Solitaire.

866
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:39,146
Scott: Well, it depends on how close you are to each other.

867
00:52:40,451 --> 00:52:44,955
Rym: Yeah, like if I'm Zulus and I spawn next to you, well, yeah, say goodbye to your workers.

868
00:52:45,967 --> 00:52:50,894
Rym: But even if you want to be political, there's the second element of power.

869
00:52:50,955 --> 00:52:56,930
Rym: differentials might be rapidly divergent based on critical decisions that get made along the way.

870
00:52:57,110 --> 00:53:02,022
Scott: Right, well that's just, you know, I obviously haven't played Civ nearly as much as everyone else because I only played it, you know.

871
00:53:02,062 --> 00:53:04,386
Rym: So there's a few players who have played way less than you, so.

872
00:53:04,527 --> 00:53:14,590
Scott: Oh, okay, but it's like, so obviously I fully expect in short order, it's like I'm keeping up as much as I can and I'm doing better than I usually do because I have a whole plenty of time to think about each turn and micromanage some things.

873
00:53:14,892 --> 00:53:16,989
Scott: I would normally just press enter a whole bunch of times.

874
00:53:18,317 --> 00:53:30,485
Scott: You know, like I'm trying, like I, you know, there was a science and I switched things up to get that science one turn earlier, you know, which made a big difference actually, whereas normally I would just press enter it one more time to get it, you know.

875
00:53:30,728 --> 00:53:38,339
Scott: So things like that, but still I fully expect like someone to stroll on up with like a tank while I still have like a musket.

876
00:53:38,564 --> 00:53:44,144
Rym: I'm worried about that because China's on an island by itself just quietly accumulating science and building an empire.

877
00:53:44,164 --> 00:53:47,602
Scott: Yeah, you're going to sail a trireme past and it's like, well, there's going to be a frigate.

878
00:53:47,886 --> 00:53:48,029
Rym: Yep.

879
00:53:48,691 --> 00:53:51,576
Rym: Alright, destroyers, missiles coming over the ocean.

880
00:53:51,636 --> 00:53:56,222
Scott: I fully expect that to happen and in which case we can just stop the game and declare that person the winner.

881
00:53:56,364 --> 00:53:57,984
Scott: There's no reason to spend the rest of our lives.

882
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:02,485
Rym: It's one of those games where it's so long that it's more like a simulation.

883
00:54:02,525 --> 00:54:05,940
Rym: Like even if you lose, you're kind of interested in like seeing how it all played out.

884
00:54:06,223 --> 00:54:09,516
Scott: Yeah, it's not like you're going to be, it's unlikely you'll be completely eliminated.

885
00:54:09,536 --> 00:54:12,449
Scott: It's more likely someone else will just build a space shuttle while you're sitting there.

886
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:24,769
Rym: But the other thing that's interesting is that when you play against AIs, the only way to make it even a reasonably interesting game is to put the AIs up, basically to put the difficulty level of Civ way, way, way up.

887
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:28,565
Scott: Yeah, see, that's how much I suck because I can't beat them when the difficulty is way up.

888
00:54:28,646 --> 00:54:31,676
Rym: Yeah, well, I can't even to a degree when you get too high because...

889
00:54:31,737 --> 00:54:34,040
Scott: I can't even beat it on anything above like Prince.

890
00:54:34,302 --> 00:54:35,150
Scott: Like Prince is hard.

891
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:35,797
Rym: Oh, really?

892
00:54:35,817 --> 00:54:35,960
Rym: Yeah.

893
00:54:38,017 --> 00:54:38,228
Rym: King?

894
00:54:39,033 --> 00:54:45,594
Rym: When I play a Civ 5 game on King, I assume I'm going to win no matter what and it's just a matter of how.

895
00:54:45,716 --> 00:54:46,589
Scott: King is a little bit tough.

896
00:54:46,994 --> 00:54:49,519
Rym: So the difficulty does not make the AI smarter.

897
00:54:50,024 --> 00:54:51,458
Rym: All it does is make them stronger.

898
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:55,336
Rym: Yeah, crazy bonuses like, oh, they get like twice as much happiness.

899
00:54:55,397 --> 00:54:59,923
Scott: Yeah, see, I don't know like how to optimize and, you know, build you know, really efficiently.

900
00:54:59,984 --> 00:55:02,045
Scott: I don't know like the build paths, just like in Starcraft.

901
00:55:02,105 --> 00:55:04,610
Scott: Same thing happens in Starcraft, even though it's real time, right?

902
00:55:04,971 --> 00:55:07,316
Scott: Is where like, I'll be building as fast as I can.

903
00:55:07,578 --> 00:55:09,334
Scott: Like, I didn't study the best way to...

904
00:55:09,395 --> 00:55:11,357
Rym: Scott, you don't know the build paths in Advance Wars.

905
00:55:11,761 --> 00:55:14,369
Scott: Right, so it's like, I'll just be, you know, I'll just be doing my thing.

906
00:55:14,692 --> 00:55:19,439
Scott: and then suddenly it's like, I got a little zerg-y and oh, here comes a whole bunch of tanks.

907
00:55:19,479 --> 00:55:20,390
Scott: It's like, what the fuck?

908
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:21,660
Scott: I have ten tanks.

909
00:55:21,963 --> 00:55:23,721
Scott: I'm still building like my first hydra list.

910
00:55:23,782 --> 00:55:24,974
Rym: But here's a nice difference.

911
00:55:25,015 --> 00:55:34,589
Rym: The AI for you might actually be harder than humans in that regard because when we're playing against a human, I've had the same number of turns as Scott and I'm playing by the same rules.

912
00:55:35,311 --> 00:55:38,150
Rym: So, he can only have built so much shit.

913
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:39,356
Rym: It's not like...

914
00:55:39,498 --> 00:55:44,184
Scott: But like, people already built wonders and like, I'm trying to build an archer to fight barbarians.

915
00:55:44,406 --> 00:55:45,800
Scott: I feel like I'm already behind.

916
00:55:45,821 --> 00:55:53,055
Rym: So, our friend who built the Great Library, James, he, England, any of you who didn't know that, it's England who did that.

917
00:55:53,076 --> 00:55:54,510
Scott: They're not listening.

918
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:56,265
Rym: Yeah, you know what Scott Johnson said.

919
00:55:56,306 --> 00:55:57,013
Rym: He said it best.

920
00:55:57,336 --> 00:55:59,742
Rym: We all know what happened to the Great Library.

921
00:55:59,964 --> 00:56:00,510
Scott: That's right.

922
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:02,258
Scott: I mean, OK, so...

923
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:06,050
Rym: He built that by doing nothing else.

924
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:08,043
Scott: So let's compare me and you, right?

925
00:56:08,286 --> 00:56:10,790
Scott: I currently have two archers and a warrior.

926
00:56:10,892 --> 00:56:11,849
Scott: How big is your military?

927
00:56:12,992 --> 00:56:17,049
Rym: I actually choose not to speak on my military right now because... It's so far away.

928
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:17,755
Rym: Yeah, but...

929
00:56:18,099 --> 00:56:19,790
Scott: Is it bigger or smaller than mine?

930
00:56:20,874 --> 00:56:22,286
Rym: It is definitely bigger than yours.

931
00:56:22,468 --> 00:56:25,738
Scott: OK, so, do you have... What's the fanciest building you have?

932
00:56:25,758 --> 00:56:26,710
Scott: I have a library.

933
00:56:27,071 --> 00:56:28,021
Rym: I have the pyramids.

934
00:56:28,364 --> 00:56:29,448
Scott: Yeah, OK, so I'm losing.

935
00:56:30,831 --> 00:56:31,964
Rym: I built... You know how much...

936
00:56:31,984 --> 00:56:33,358
Scott: Do you have... How many cities do you have?

937
00:56:33,419 --> 00:56:34,065
Scott: I have two cities.

938
00:56:34,085 --> 00:56:34,529
Rym: I only have two.

939
00:56:35,432 --> 00:56:36,490
Scott: OK, so we have the same.

940
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:38,108
Rym: I'm not even building a settler right now.

941
00:56:39,274 --> 00:56:40,209
Rym: I only have two cities.

942
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:41,805
Scott: I also have two cities.

943
00:56:41,846 --> 00:56:41,988
Scott: Yeah.

944
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:45,745
Scott: So you're ahead of me because you have a pyramid and I have one worker.

945
00:56:45,826 --> 00:56:46,836
Rym: I don't have any libraries.

946
00:56:47,523 --> 00:56:47,887
Scott: OK.

947
00:56:47,907 --> 00:56:49,320
Rym: Because I built a pyramid instead.

948
00:56:49,542 --> 00:56:51,260
Scott: Yeah, a pyramid's a lot bigger than a library.

949
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,150
Rym: Yeah, what does the pyramid do?

950
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:53,361
Rym: How much do you think that's going to help me?

951
00:56:53,442 --> 00:56:55,545
Scott: Pyramid spits out workers when it's done being built.

952
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:55,950
Scott: Yeah.

953
00:56:56,753 --> 00:56:57,810
Scott: And it does something else, I forget.

954
00:56:58,371 --> 00:56:59,199
Rym: My workers work 25% faster.

955
00:56:59,219 --> 00:56:59,361
Rym: Right.

956
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:01,825
Scott: My workers are actually working mad slow.

957
00:57:01,866 --> 00:57:02,513
Scott: I kind of wish I had...

958
00:57:02,635 --> 00:57:03,930
Rym: Well, maybe if you'd gone liberty.

959
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:06,654
Rym: I don't know why you went tradition.

960
00:57:06,674 --> 00:57:07,421
Rym: Tradition sucks.

961
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:11,259
Scott: I didn't go tradition because I needed, you know, I was falling behind.

962
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,280
Rym: You should have gone honor with all those barbarians.

963
00:57:13,361 --> 00:57:15,684
Scott: Well, I didn't know there were so many barbarians by the time I picked it.

964
00:57:15,704 --> 00:57:16,594
Rym: You could still do it.

965
00:57:16,635 --> 00:57:17,650
Rym: You'll still get that honor bonus.

966
00:57:18,492 --> 00:57:18,815
Scott: I don't know.

967
00:57:18,836 --> 00:57:21,099
Scott: I'll see how many barbarians are left by the time my culture reaches.

968
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:25,541
Rym: Plus, honor does other things like free grade generals, better XP for troops.

969
00:57:26,046 --> 00:57:26,550
Scott: Yeah, maybe.

970
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:30,009
Rym: That'll matter because Lisa's going to roll over that Russian AI and then come straight at you.

971
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:30,654
Scott: We'll see.

972
00:57:30,674 --> 00:57:31,685
Rym: You know that's going to happen.

973
00:57:31,725 --> 00:57:32,150
Scott: That's all right.

974
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:33,179
Scott: I got two archers.

975
00:57:33,684 --> 00:57:43,180
Rym: But there's just something about playing Civ 5 with humans and it is interesting that the only way to do this is to use this fan-made, giant multiplayer robot.

976
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,976
Scott: There is built-in multiplayer and it doesn't... It's not completely broken.

977
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:48,130
Scott: It is completely broken.

978
00:57:49,035 --> 00:57:51,502
Scott: I tried to use it a couple times and it was a fail.

979
00:57:51,522 --> 00:57:52,998
Rym: I set up a pit-boss server.

980
00:57:53,058 --> 00:57:54,634
Rym: It just crashed and ruined a game.

981
00:57:54,654 --> 00:58:02,410
Rym: I ran a game just as multiplayer, which meant it would only play when my PC was running and eventually the game got corrupted.

982
00:58:03,919 --> 00:58:06,430
Rym: I did a hot seat, which also just fucked up at one point.

983
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:08,390
Rym: There's no way to play this game multiplayer.

984
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:14,916
Rym: And I asked my friends who got me into giant multiplayer robot, those other people, like, "Hey, why don't we do pit-boss or

985
00:58:14,936 --> 00:58:15,300
Rym: something?".

986
00:58:15,744 --> 00:58:21,744
Rym: And every one of them had the thousand yard stare of "I lost a 300 turn or whatever game to that.

987
00:58:22,047 --> 00:58:22,673
Rym: Doesn't work.

988
00:58:22,814 --> 00:58:24,227
Rym: Every game will get corrupted in the

989
00:58:24,348 --> 00:58:24,449
Rym: end.".

990
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:28,369
Rym: There's no way to play Civ 5 multiplayer except with this GMR thing.

991
00:58:30,405 --> 00:58:31,268
Rym: So yeah, played a bunch of games.

992
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,579
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

993
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:07,129
Rym: [patrons].

994
01:00:11,204 --> 01:00:14,294
Rym: I know there have been a few scant updates to the Patreon.

995
01:00:14,314 --> 01:00:19,711
Rym: I trickled a little bits in along the way, but more Rym's Rants are coming.

996
01:00:20,034 --> 01:00:21,386
Rym: We're finally back from the holidays.

997
01:00:21,427 --> 01:00:23,839
Rym: We had a lot of weddings and sickness and travel and everything.

998
01:00:24,982 --> 01:00:27,570
Rym: We're actually not doing a show on Thursday because more stuff came up.

999
01:00:28,117 --> 01:00:30,032
Rym: But there's a lot of updates.

1000
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:44,213
Rym: So for one, we're going to give you guys, the Patrons at least, a bunch of sort of pre-warning about the panels we're doing at PAX East, MagFest, Zenkai Con, and a few other conventions upcoming because we have that information.

1001
01:00:44,274 --> 01:00:45,183
Rym: It's just not public yet.

1002
01:00:45,385 --> 01:00:46,072
Rym: So you guys will know.

1003
01:00:46,617 --> 01:00:50,720
Rym: Two, the Utena stuff, all the rest of the new equipment I bought has arrived.

1004
01:00:51,260 --> 01:01:01,485
Rym: So I'm actually this week doing a little bit of test video and if everything goes smoothly on Sunday, Scott's coming over and we're going to finally fully resume.

1005
01:01:01,546 --> 01:01:02,677
Rym: GeekNights Presents Utena.

1006
01:01:02,737 --> 01:01:06,576
Rym: All that new pre-production has been largely completed.

1007
01:01:06,597 --> 01:01:11,647
Rym: So we might be able to crank these things out pretty quick once we get the ball rolling.

1008
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:14,334
Rym: So otherwise, stay tuned.

1009
01:01:14,394 --> 01:01:15,949
Rym: There'll be some Rym's Rants and things coming.

1010
01:01:16,374 --> 01:01:22,334
Rym: And I leave you with one of the most wonderful things I have ever found.

1011
01:01:22,354 --> 01:01:25,820
Rym: And I don't think this requires any explanation.

1012
01:01:29,282 --> 01:01:30,938
Media: Go, go, go.

1013
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:32,834
Media: Go, go.

1014
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:34,474
Media: Go, go.

1015
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:36,697
Media: Gotta go fast.

1016
01:01:38,001 --> 01:01:39,277
Media: Gotta go fast.

1017
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:46,180
Media: Gotta go faster, faster, faster, faster, faster.

1018
01:01:48,312 --> 01:01:51,297
Media: Movin' at speed of sound make tracks.

1019
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,519
Media: Quickest hedgehog around.

1020
01:01:55,821 --> 01:02:01,359
Media: Got ourselves a situation stuck in a new location.

1021
01:02:02,441 --> 01:02:05,080
Media: Without any explanation.

1022
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:08,640
Media: No time for relaxation.

1023
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:16,656
Media: Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't blink, don't think.

1024
01:02:17,881 --> 01:02:21,085
Media: Just go, go, go, go.

1025
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:23,323
Media: G-g-g-go.

1026
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:25,403
Media: Go.

1027
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:28,211
Rym: Nuh-nuh.

1028
01:02:29,282 --> 01:02:30,919
Media: Nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh.

1029
01:02:32,404 --> 01:02:33,115
Media: Nuh-nuh.

1030
01:02:34,102 --> 01:02:35,919
Media: Nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh.

1031
01:02:37,508 --> 01:02:39,658
Media: Sonic, he's on the run.

1032
01:02:40,687 --> 01:02:43,017
Media: Sonic, he's number one.

1033
01:02:44,142 --> 01:02:46,486
Media: Sonic, he's coming next.

1034
01:02:47,194 --> 01:02:52,428
Media: So watch out for Sonic X. Gotta go fast.

1035
01:02:53,155 --> 01:02:54,937
Media: Sonic, gotta go fast.

1036
01:02:56,061 --> 01:03:02,358
Media: Sonic, gotta go faster, faster, faster, faster, faster.

1037
01:03:03,721 --> 01:03:04,994
Media: Go, go, go, go.

1038
01:03:06,023 --> 01:03:06,570
Media: Gotta go fast.

1039
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:09,977
Media: Gotta go faster, faster, faster, faster, faster.

1040
01:03:12,202 --> 01:03:13,640
Media: Movin' at speed of sound.

1041
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,724
Rym: Let's try quick and sketch hard to round.

1042
01:03:15,744 --> 01:03:17,257
Scott: Got ourselves a situation.

1043
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,398
Rym: Stuck in a new location.

1044
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:22,460
Rym: Without any explanation.

1045
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,100
Rym: No time for relaxation.

1046
01:03:26,184 --> 01:03:28,538
Rym: Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't blink, don't think.

1047
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,137
Rym: Just go, go, go, go.

1048
01:03:32,823 --> 01:03:34,120
Rym: Sonic, nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh.

1049
01:03:36,453 --> 01:03:38,458
Rym: Sonic, he's on the run.

1050
01:03:38,478 --> 01:03:39,811
Rym: Sonic, he's number one.

1051
01:03:39,852 --> 01:03:41,489
Rym: Sonic, he's coming next.

1052
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:43,777
Rym: So watch out for Sonic X. Gotta go fast.

1053
01:03:44,642 --> 01:03:44,872
Rym: Sonic.
