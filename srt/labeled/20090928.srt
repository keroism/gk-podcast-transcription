1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,589
Rym: Hey, it's Monday September 28th.

2
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:12,672
Rym: I'm ready.

3
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:16,184
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight I cop out.

4
00:00:16,426 --> 00:00:19,560
Rym: we bring you the tech news round up.

5
00:00:25,911 --> 00:00:26,927
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:31,053 --> 00:00:33,261
Rym: And we're back from her last convention for a while now.

7
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:35,188
Rym: We can just kind of chill until what packs.

8
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:37,186
Rym: well We got a. we got a move.

9
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:40,135
Rym: I'm only talking about conventions.

10
00:00:40,155 --> 00:00:43,425
Rym: We don't have any big conventions that are in the next couple of weeks.

11
00:00:43,927 --> 00:00:47,650
Scott: There's actually this There's some stuff in the in the coming weeks.

12
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,419
Scott: There's a yahoo hack day thing that I'm going to.

13
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,145
Scott: probably not you got I don't know.

14
00:00:52,165 --> 00:00:53,989
Scott: you got to sign up and get accepted Whatever.

15
00:00:55,132 --> 00:01:01,602
Scott: There's also there's a GD GT They event that's gonna happen in the city on October 1st.

16
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,990
Scott: I think it's 7 p.m Yeah, probably not going to that.

17
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:04,798
Scott: I'm gonna check it out.

18
00:01:04,878 --> 00:01:13,115
Scott: cuz they got big-time Sponsors like like all sorts like Microsoft and Sony and like it's gonna be big booths and everything like a mini CES.

19
00:01:13,215 --> 00:01:19,270
Rym: almost it's on a Thursday night some tech thing Yep, and then I got stuff to do.

20
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:27,254
Rym: I'll check it, but I bring that up mostly because I know many new people are probably here after the New York anime festival, so We mentioned this.

21
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:31,630
Rym: remember GeekNights is four different shows and you're listening to the lint the neckbeard Linux show.

22
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:39,272
Rym: No I would recommend coming back on Wednesday when we'll talk about the New York anime festival and anime manga comics all the stuff you probably Expect.

23
00:01:39,453 --> 00:01:41,220
Scott: I would not recommend coming back on Wednesday.

24
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:50,606
Scott: if you're a New York anime festival person you Hopefully know about anime and you don't really need to listen to Wednesday Even though you probably will learn something on Wednesday because we probably know more than you.

25
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:55,898
Scott: However odds are You don't know too much about technology.

26
00:01:55,938 --> 00:02:00,050
Scott: if I know anime fans is actually surprising how few of them are technically knowledgeable.

27
00:02:00,632 --> 00:02:10,202
Scott: Therefore you should listen to the Monday shows and learn about the technology which affects every person who lives in The entire world regardless of your interest.

28
00:02:10,222 --> 00:02:11,005
Rym: just care about anime.

29
00:02:11,025 --> 00:02:11,607
Rym: come on Wednesday.

30
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:12,370
Rym: We'll talk about anime.

31
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:13,997
Rym: Yeah, I've been watching some anime.

32
00:02:14,157 --> 00:02:15,302
Scott: I haven't watched any anime.

33
00:02:15,342 --> 00:02:17,882
Scott: It's all video games and board games I've been watching.

34
00:02:17,903 --> 00:02:23,806
Rym: so of course I look everything got derailed when I started reading one of my trashy Temeraire novels.

35
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:25,110
Scott: Why are you eating trash?

36
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,593
Rym: It's good trash.

37
00:02:26,673 --> 00:02:28,178
Scott: I'm all reading erudite stuff.

38
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:28,720
Rym: Yeah.

39
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,101
Rym: Yeah.

40
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:29,482
Rym: Mr.

41
00:02:29,522 --> 00:02:31,067
Rym: Has seen all of initial D.

42
00:02:31,328 --> 00:02:31,890
Scott: That's right.

43
00:02:32,212 --> 00:02:33,764
Scott: I didn't say always.

44
00:02:33,844 --> 00:02:39,259
Scott: I said now So I didn't say for the.

45
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:40,650
Scott: I didn't say forever either.

46
00:02:41,655 --> 00:02:48,710
Rym: Since we're doing the the periodic tech news Roundup we're not gonna do any news in the first half of the show because that would be kind of stupid.

47
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,746
Rym: We what we do two news have a break and then just do a bunch more news.

48
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:52,550
Scott: Yeah, that's no good.

49
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,177
Scott: Plus we'll run out of news if we do that.

50
00:02:54,238 --> 00:02:55,222
Rym: I got plenty of news.

51
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:55,684
Scott: All right.

52
00:02:55,825 --> 00:03:08,475
Scott: But anyway, yeah I got a a little rant, you know, what really grind Scott's gears why we got to use someone else's, you know It's like but this is the bull There's grinding gears.

53
00:03:08,515 --> 00:03:09,299
Scott: So what do we have?

54
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:10,624
Scott: I don't know.

55
00:03:10,644 --> 00:03:12,552
Rym: you want to call it when you want something I don't know.

56
00:03:12,613 --> 00:03:16,490
Scott: It's a call it something but all the good ones are taken, you know, we can grant and whatever.

57
00:03:17,293 --> 00:03:18,647
Scott: so basically the thing you know, what's?

58
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:26,689
Scott: I've noticed a lot of people lately as in the past year a few right they really really complain about.

59
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:30,116
Scott: you know This application is a resource hog.

60
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:31,319
Scott: Oh, it's not light.

61
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,904
Scott: Oh, it's using too many.

62
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:34,127
Scott: It's it's got using too much RAM.

63
00:03:34,188 --> 00:03:38,585
Rym: Yeah Right, I wouldn't say that's a recent phenomenon.

64
00:03:38,806 --> 00:03:39,650
Scott: Well, it doesn't matter.

65
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,350
Rym: I've noticed it was even worse back in the day when it was a serious problem.

66
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:46,316
Rym: I know if I open more than three IE browsers My computer would cry.

67
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:46,738
Rym: and you have.

68
00:03:46,818 --> 00:03:49,671
Scott: you have approached the crux of my point here Right?

69
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:52,683
Scott: is that I've noticed these complaints more and more frequently.

70
00:03:52,723 --> 00:04:00,269
Scott: like people will use one program That is like less feature-rich over another because it's lighter or because they have this perception of it, right?

71
00:04:01,011 --> 00:04:07,430
Scott: That it seems lighter or they see it using less RAM on the RAM meter or it takes up less disk space.

72
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,248
Scott: All right.

73
00:04:08,892 --> 00:04:17,238
Scott: First of all, if you have a computer that doesn't really have enough RAM to run modern application Just buy some more RAM buy some more goddamn RAM.

74
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,644
Rym: It's like five dollars.

75
00:04:18,684 --> 00:04:19,165
Rym: boys this out.

76
00:04:19,206 --> 00:04:23,756
Rym: my computer, you know I made a badass computer Years ago.

77
00:04:23,817 --> 00:04:25,588
Rym: It's obviously not that badass anymore.

78
00:04:25,608 --> 00:04:25,910
Rym: You know what?

79
00:04:26,712 --> 00:04:31,124
Rym: I'm only using about 30% of my RAM and that includes the cache right now.

80
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:33,090
Rym: Yeah, I've got four gigs of RAM.

81
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,818
Rym: I'm using almost none of it, right?

82
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:37,390
Rym: I mean I see both my cores are practically idle.

83
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:42,910
Scott: I mean think about it if you want and if anything right you want it to use more RAM, right?

84
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,335
Scott: It's like you got four gigs of RAM Like I do.

85
00:04:45,355 --> 00:04:48,774
Scott: if only you're using two There's two going to waste.

86
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:52,145
Scott: your computer could be using those other two to go even faster.

87
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:55,035
Scott: and that's actually if using Linux Don't worry, you're all.

88
00:04:55,136 --> 00:05:01,596
Scott: Linux automatically uses all your RAM as much as it possibly Aggressive disk cache.

89
00:05:01,637 --> 00:05:03,967
Rym: I'm just noting Windows does not even in Linux.

90
00:05:04,028 --> 00:05:07,883
Rym: right now I'm using less than 33% of my RAM including the cache.

91
00:05:07,964 --> 00:05:09,028
Rym: I just have so much RAM.

92
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:11,636
Scott: I know Okay, so that's number one.

93
00:05:11,716 --> 00:05:12,899
Scott: number two disk space.

94
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:14,584
Rym: Oh, one of my cores is doing something now.

95
00:05:14,844 --> 00:05:20,250
Scott: drives are so So cheap you could get like terabytes for nothing.

96
00:05:20,391 --> 00:05:27,180
Scott: So if a program takes up like a hundred more megs than the competitor That is not a reason to pick one over the other.

97
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,490
Scott: a hundred megs is so such a small amount of disk space.

98
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:31,759
Scott: I don't even notice it.

99
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,270
Scott: It's like effectively invisible.

100
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:42,282
Scott: Number three it is true that some programs just faster than others I mean Chrome is just faster than Firefox.

101
00:05:42,463 --> 00:05:43,125
Scott: that I mean it.

102
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:44,330
Scott: it just is right.

103
00:05:44,532 --> 00:05:46,668
Scott: It's you know, they're benchmarks to prove it.

104
00:05:47,151 --> 00:05:50,124
Scott: But don't go by just your perception.

105
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:53,115
Scott: a lot of times you will perceive Something to be faster.

106
00:05:53,155 --> 00:05:55,020
Scott: they it feels faster they say.

107
00:05:55,401 --> 00:05:57,006
Scott: but then an actual benchmark shows.

108
00:05:57,086 --> 00:05:58,370
Scott: No, it's just your perception.

109
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:03,450
Scott: Well, it's tricky because benchmark, you know, some UI element makes it seem lighter or seem faster.

110
00:06:03,872 --> 00:06:04,314
Rym: Well one.

111
00:06:04,355 --> 00:06:13,410
Rym: I would argue that unless you're doing large amounts of data processing Perception probably matters more than the benchmark, especially because most benchmarks are not terribly accurate to actual use cases.

112
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:18,136
Scott: No, no, but you can actually have you know, like, you know, UI And benchmarks.

113
00:06:18,196 --> 00:06:30,415
Rym: as opposed to you know, a lot of benchmarks will just do like the render time or stuff like that If you've got an application that is measurably faster in the UI than another application and yet people perceive the other slower Application to be faster.

114
00:06:30,455 --> 00:06:31,700
Rym: You have done something wrong.

115
00:06:31,981 --> 00:06:34,090
Scott: Yeah, your application is doing something wrong.

116
00:06:34,531 --> 00:06:35,533
Rym: Yes, but that's important.

117
00:06:35,553 --> 00:06:40,706
Rym: especially, you know, we love open source software, but often not the best user interfaces.

118
00:06:40,726 --> 00:06:41,668
Rym: Yeah GIMP.

119
00:06:41,728 --> 00:06:42,289
Rym: I'm looking at you.

120
00:06:43,811 --> 00:06:45,919
Rym: Anyway, I used to think that GIMP was a good interface.

121
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:50,056
Rym: then I watched someone who knew how to draw try to use the GIMP for more than five minutes.

122
00:06:50,498 --> 00:06:53,090
Scott: Yeah, but the thing is, you know, anyway, we're not gonna get it.

123
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,216
Scott: Do it go down that road.

124
00:06:54,236 --> 00:06:55,322
Scott: That's not the road.

125
00:06:55,342 --> 00:06:55,986
Scott: We're going down.

126
00:06:56,006 --> 00:06:56,570
Rym: That's Thursday.

127
00:06:56,971 --> 00:07:05,948
Scott: My point is right is that when you you know, a lot of people, you know, it's okay to choose Chrome over Firefox Right, but it's because it's faster, which it is.

128
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:11,174
Scott: Don't go telling me you're using Chrome over Firefox because it uses less RAM You're not you?

129
00:07:11,254 --> 00:07:16,050
Scott: unless you're using all of your RAM and you have no money to buy more right?

130
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:20,810
Scott: That's the only person who has a valid complaint about how much RAM it's using, right?

131
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,329
Scott: Maybe this is you know stability if you can measure, you know that.

132
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:29,490
Scott: yes This is crashing more than that other one, you know, and you can tell that the crashing isn't your fault.

133
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:36,835
Rym: Well one more which often is one possible but unlikely case is the low-power netbook That is true.

134
00:07:36,996 --> 00:07:38,907
Rym: But then again, you're using all your RAM and you can't get more.

135
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:39,389
Rym: So there you go.

136
00:07:40,612 --> 00:07:53,579
Scott: So, you know a lot of people they're just they're like picking, you know Which after deciding which application to use based on like these completely irrational factors of you know Some perceived increased resource usage.

137
00:07:53,780 --> 00:08:05,969
Rym: Well at the same time, you know in my line of work This actually affects me To a great degree because one, you know, we a problem we will sometimes run into is that a trader, you know We're a stock kind of company.

138
00:08:06,392 --> 00:08:14,370
Rym: Well, you install our application and complain that it's too much of a load on their system But we know how much load our application puts on someone's system and it's basically nothing.

139
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:22,650
Scott: Yeah it uses basically Gooey with a few buttons like effectively the same as like a visual basic app with some network data traffic.

140
00:08:23,317 --> 00:08:24,370
Rym: It's a more complicated than that.

141
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:30,670
Rym: We have different things but regardless the actual reason for that as I've discovered is that in the stock world?

142
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:37,869
Rym: there's something called an OMS an order management system and that is what like The big bad trader at a company like manages all the or it's like the Bloomberg machine.

143
00:08:38,111 --> 00:08:39,717
Rym: Nah, Bloomberg machine is something different.

144
00:08:39,798 --> 00:08:42,830
Rym: Okay, but an OMS would be like McGregor Charles River.

145
00:08:42,991 --> 00:08:45,912
Scott: So this is like it's basically a screen full of numbers I'm guessing.

146
00:08:46,053 --> 00:08:54,787
Rym: basically an OMS is the thing where like the head trader of a company will put in like I Want my company to buy 10 million of this 10 million of that 100 million of that 40 million of that.

147
00:08:56,054 --> 00:08:58,572
Rym: I only want to pay this much for that as much, you know All that stuff.

148
00:08:59,134 --> 00:09:07,147
Rym: and then they allocate chunks of all this stuff to all their traders and then the traders Go and get it done in their little OMS is get these tickets of.

149
00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:08,495
Rym: you know Get this done.

150
00:09:08,636 --> 00:09:10,770
Rym: and then they use their discretion of duties.

151
00:09:11,494 --> 00:09:20,810
Rym: Let me tell you are these things, you know The words resource intensive never meant much to me even in all the data processing that processing and audio and video have done in my life.

152
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:33,410
Rym: Until I loaded one of these bastards on my computer at work four gigs of RAM quad-core Brought to its knees for like two minutes while one of these things loads up And it was using all the resources.

153
00:09:34,751 --> 00:09:40,970
Scott: See now that is a valid complaint right there, you know, but like, you know, I watch some of these stock traders.

154
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:50,188
Rym: They'll have like five monitors and like this quad-core like eight gigabyte 64-bit monster of a machine And they're still complaining about how slow it is.

155
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:58,425
Scott: I mean that that that tells me the application just poorly written because there's no reason that a program that just you know Does stock stuff should take up that much resource.

156
00:09:58,486 --> 00:09:59,310
Rym: Well, you'd be surprised.

157
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,849
Rym: I mean think about the logistics of for example, say you have an application right?

158
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,376
Rym: Consuming market data.

159
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:06,924
Rym: It's not just you know, what do you I mean?

160
00:10:06,944 --> 00:10:08,110
Rym: What do you think stock prices are?

161
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,633
Rym: It's not like.

162
00:10:08,673 --> 00:10:09,800
Rym: there's just like this.

163
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,249
Rym: is the price now this?

164
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:12,115
Scott: yeah But that's see.

165
00:10:12,135 --> 00:10:14,190
Scott: what I'm saying is that it's a poor architecture, right?

166
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:23,047
Scott: If you need like market data consumed and you have a trading company or like, you know Whatever, you should have some sort of centralized powerhouse machine that's doing that.

167
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:23,850
Rym: So it consumes it.

168
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,338
Rym: How do I get it from there to me?

169
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:32,883
Scott: and then the machine that you're sitting at is only getting the data it needs From your big nasty server in the closet.

170
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:33,124
Scott: Yeah.

171
00:10:33,144 --> 00:10:34,469
Rym: So what data do I need there?

172
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,865
Rym: There are multiple levels of the order book for at any second.

173
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:39,853
Rym: the market data Problem.

174
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:40,756
Scott: it sounds to me like.

175
00:10:40,797 --> 00:10:44,730
Scott: the problem though is the desktop is doing all the work and getting the data feed right into it.

176
00:10:46,253 --> 00:10:47,330
Rym: That's not really the problem.

177
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:54,358
Rym: The problem is that even if you have big bad machines to get it and parse it there's still just so much data Mm-hmm, and you also you have to deal with it.

178
00:10:54,398 --> 00:10:57,129
Rym: What if you're trying to route out to like algos or something like that?

179
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,610
Scott: Anyway, the point is but no the architecture.

180
00:11:01,353 --> 00:11:03,342
Rym: But it's not crap for the reasons you'd expect.

181
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:10,304
Scott: when you're deciding, you know When you're choosing between various applications like you're choosing your browser, you're choosing your media player.

182
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:11,568
Scott: You're choosing your whatever, right?

183
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:18,461
Scott: base your decisions upon Rational factors and not things like.

184
00:11:18,622 --> 00:11:20,468
Scott: it uses 10 more megs of RAM.

185
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:25,286
Scott: Oh, no That means it's worse because usually it's using those 10 megs of RAM for like some feature.

186
00:11:25,306 --> 00:11:26,110
Scott: That's probably worth it.

187
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:33,250
Rym: Well, if you fall down that trap I mean I remember when the screen on my laptop just stopped working one day and I actually got it repaired for free under the warranty.

188
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:33,874
Rym: I was shocked.

189
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:38,430
Rym: I expected to have to pay like a thousand dollars to fix that Yep, and I got it all fixed.

190
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:45,602
Rym: But the tech who fixed it like he got it all done and first he pretended that it was gonna cost me like 900 bucks and then after I was like god damn it.

191
00:11:45,683 --> 00:11:46,165
Rym: I went to pay.

192
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:51,030
Rym: he's like nah, I just fucking with you Yeah, but then he was like, you know now he was obviously a bait-and-swing.

193
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,481
Rym: He pulls the RAM out of my laptop.

194
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:58,078
Rym: My laptop has two gigs of RAM on one stick Mm-hmm, and he's like you got three slots here.

195
00:11:58,359 --> 00:12:03,664
Rym: feel how hot that RAM is because you only have one stick if you buy Two more two gig sticks.

196
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:04,450
Rym: It'll even it out.

197
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:07,639
Rym: And I was like, yeah, thanks for fixing my laptop.

198
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,248
Rym: Give me my computer back with that Ram back in there.

199
00:12:12,491 --> 00:12:13,976
Scott: Yeah, Ram is hot we know.

200
00:12:13,996 --> 00:12:18,390
Rym: plus I'm like you realize how long it'll take for me to hibernate my computer with six gigs of RAM.

201
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:24,663
Rym: Yeah So true, yeah, so I you know, I have an opposite rant.

202
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,410
Rym: I have the exact opposite of a rant.

203
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:34,762
Rym: You see I led a very privileged life and until after I had graduated high school I never in my life held a job.

204
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:47,030
Rym: the closest thing to a job I ever had was like marching band in high school or I remember I used to charge local kids 15 bucks a half hour for Trumpet lessons and but I never had an actual job and I left Kyle.

205
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,693
Rym: I left all right.

206
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:48,195
Rym: God.

207
00:12:48,215 --> 00:12:48,999
Rym: I keep thinking like college.

208
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:49,742
Rym: I left high school.

209
00:12:49,762 --> 00:12:51,450
Rym: I had that summer of nothing.

210
00:12:52,192 --> 00:12:54,489
Rym: So I decided I should get a job and get some money.

211
00:12:55,093 --> 00:12:58,831
Rym: So I applied to work for the US Census the census 2000.

212
00:12:58,831 --> 00:13:05,718
Rym: I was a payroll clerk and HR clerk and I did a bunch of other crazy stuff for the census for that whole summer and Let me tell you to this day.

213
00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:07,993
Rym: It was one of the most fun jobs I ever had like.

214
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:11,750
Rym: working for the US Census was so unlike what I expected.

215
00:13:12,012 --> 00:13:18,229
Rym: Pretty much everyone working there was cool because for the most part These were people who didn't need to work who wanted to work for fun.

216
00:13:19,073 --> 00:13:25,332
Rym: They were like housewives who were like I'll get out of the house and work for the census and do a good thing and save the world and said to stop It's all cool.

217
00:13:26,275 --> 00:13:30,188
Rym: And I was thinking about it and I'm not really in a position to work for the 2010 census.

218
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:36,324
Rym: I haven't even though I still have a letter of recommendation from like the regional director of the part of the census I worked for him.

219
00:13:37,052 --> 00:13:43,558
Rym: They basically decided I was a badass and they were like if you want to work for the census in 2010 You can like run a regional office.

220
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:45,767
Scott: No, I wonder how much that pays.

221
00:13:45,888 --> 00:13:46,470
Rym: not that much.

222
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,929
Rym: Do you leave absence to do that as much as I would like to?

223
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,101
Rym: They're not going to pay me even a fraction of what I make in my stock market stuff.

224
00:13:54,462 --> 00:13:56,690
Scott: Yeah, but you would count things.

225
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,520
Rym: Yeah, yeah, but one thing I can say.

226
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:05,157
Scott: you thought you could send guys out and say listen There's five crab people living in Hudson Valley.

227
00:14:05,197 --> 00:14:05,759
Scott: I was paid.

228
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,865
Rym: I worked 40 hours a week for that summer.

229
00:14:07,886 --> 00:14:10,593
Rym: I was paid $11.35 an hour.

230
00:14:10,613 --> 00:14:17,636
Rym: That's pretty good in for the year 2000 in Year $2,000.

231
00:14:17,636 --> 00:14:20,052
Rym: That was a lot of money Yeah I mean.

232
00:14:20,454 --> 00:14:27,884
Rym: and the thing is I think back and I remember when I got my first paycheck and it was like 400 bucks and I'm looking at this and I realized how much money this was.

233
00:14:27,904 --> 00:14:29,329
Rym: It was all mine video games.

234
00:14:30,592 --> 00:14:32,049
Rym: That's why I came to RIT.

235
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:40,826
Scott: That's why I got a job in high school as soon as I was legally able to and that is why I was able to buy computers and video games and all sorts of other stuff.

236
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:41,630
Scott: It's got privileged life.

237
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,123
Scott: My parents bought me all that stuff and that's why I am very glad I did not.

238
00:14:45,223 --> 00:14:48,637
Scott: I was done playing Magic the Gathering by The time I was able to get a job.

239
00:14:48,697 --> 00:14:50,303
Rym: Magic cards were just like swords.

240
00:14:50,544 --> 00:14:51,910
Rym: It's a damn fucking good thing.

241
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,004
Rym: You never had money when you wanted Magic cards.

242
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:58,690
Scott: When I got a job I was tired of Magic the Gathering and I was tired of all stupid crap like that.

243
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,930
Scott: And all I wanted was computers and video games.

244
00:15:02,051 --> 00:15:03,758
Rym: I used that money for one thing.

245
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,062
Rym: that job is why when I went to RIT I showed up with a $4,000 computer.

246
00:15:10,392 --> 00:15:13,570
Rym: I mean, I had the baddest as computer in the world when I got to RIT.

247
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:17,950
Scott: It's also the first thing I did when I had my job, you know in high school working at the dry-cleaner.

248
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:18,716
Rym: See, that's another benefit.

249
00:15:18,776 --> 00:15:22,838
Scott: I saved up and bought a Pentium 3 450 megahertz.

250
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,930
Rym: Oh my god.

251
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:28,530
Rym: Yeah, I remember I bought like an AMD like 900 megahertz with that thing.

252
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:33,309
Scott: It lasted a long time until I replaced it with that AMD and then I replaced the AMD with what I have.

253
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,344
Rym: now I'm only on my third desktop in my whole life.

254
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:36,807
Rym: Third.

255
00:15:36,847 --> 00:15:39,924
Scott: God, let's see I had the 486 but that really wasn't.

256
00:15:39,944 --> 00:15:41,050
Scott: that was a family computer.

257
00:15:41,351 --> 00:15:46,650
Rym: Yeah, my first computer that I bought was that AMD 900 and then I bought the computer I'm using now.

258
00:15:47,171 --> 00:15:48,014
Scott: You're only on number two.

259
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:52,530
Rym: Yeah, well in between remember my motherboard blew up, but that was an incremental upgrade.

260
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,135
Rym: Yeah, I went up to a Thunderbird.

261
00:15:54,155 --> 00:15:58,809
Scott: I've had plenty of upgrades adding drives and all that, you know RAM and who knows what.

262
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:01,678
Rym: so Yep, yep, but what point of advice?

263
00:16:01,698 --> 00:16:04,207
Rym: the first for all you nerds out there and all you punk kids.

264
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:05,170
Rym: you want some money.

265
00:16:05,872 --> 00:16:07,016
Rym: Work for the census.

266
00:16:07,076 --> 00:16:11,090
Rym: they pay real well, and you basically don't have to do any work at all.

267
00:16:11,731 --> 00:16:12,674
Rym: It's just super fun.

268
00:16:12,714 --> 00:16:23,208
Rym: Everyone's cool and they need tech people and the test you take to work for the census Basically amounts to can you breathe and can you add two two-digit numbers to each other?

269
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:26,365
Rym: Hmm You would be surprised how many people fail this test.

270
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:33,270
Rym: Yep Well, or you might not be depending on you know, yeah that was that was one of the first points when Rym became very cynical.

271
00:16:33,753 --> 00:16:36,469
Scott: So, you know Rym was talking about the census and I was like man.

272
00:16:37,091 --> 00:16:39,639
Scott: Census needs to get more technologies going on.

273
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,845
Rym: Yeah, Scott's like where's the fucking API for this?

274
00:16:41,885 --> 00:16:43,450
Rym: probably like some busted old database.

275
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:44,616
Rym: He's really down on it.

276
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:47,149
Rym: So we go to the census website, you know census gov.

277
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,918
Rym: There's just API's open source tools.

278
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:50,943
Rym: You can get it all the data.

279
00:16:50,963 --> 00:16:51,505
Rym: You can download.

280
00:16:51,525 --> 00:16:58,248
Scott: there is a public domain Software package for the census and I'm like, oh shit I am all over this action.

281
00:16:58,691 --> 00:17:04,277
Scott: But you know people always braille all these all these open source guys like probably don't even know about this Like everyone's ignoring it.

282
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,128
Scott: I'm so gonna rock the house.

283
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:11,569
Rym: I mean since this API the US government is generally very behind the times very crap when it comes to technology.

284
00:17:12,212 --> 00:17:21,617
Rym: But there are tiny pieces of it that are very very well run and it the census of the United States is One of the coolest things our government does.

285
00:17:21,757 --> 00:17:31,470
Rym: and it amazes me the amount of wargling and bullshit that the Republican Party basically is pulling out of the woodwork this year and I think I know why this is more Thursday.

286
00:17:31,531 --> 00:17:37,102
Rym: But I want to point out to everyone out there The right-wing and the Republicans are basically getting to the point where they may.

287
00:17:37,163 --> 00:17:44,050
Rym: a lot of people may boycott the census or fight against It even though the census is one of the few things that's actually directly in the Constitution.

288
00:17:44,592 --> 00:17:48,547
Scott: Yeah, it says right in the Constitution not even in a law or anything else.

289
00:17:48,627 --> 00:17:55,026
Scott: in the Constitution It says there shall be a census every ten years now to count the people with.

290
00:17:55,046 --> 00:17:56,290
Scott: those aren't the exact words.

291
00:17:56,956 --> 00:17:58,090
Scott: The gray has the word sense.

292
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:09,189
Rym: The greatest part about all this is that one part of the reason I think the right-wing is scared Is that in America there has been a huge shift in population toward, you know liberal places and cities and things.

293
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:14,123
Rym: and Also, there's been a big shift away from a lot of places where Republicans had majorities.

294
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:17,439
Rym: and one thing the census does for people They don't live in the United States.

295
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:26,050
Rym: Is that every time we do it That determines how many you know seats in the House of Representatives different states get how many votes they get in the Electoral College.

296
00:18:26,692 --> 00:18:36,930
Rym: There's a good chance that all the so-called blue states are gonna get a bunch of seats and votes And all the so-called red states are gonna lose a bunch of seats and votes and they don't want that to happen.

297
00:18:37,431 --> 00:18:47,315
Rym: However by boycotting the census the people who are losing the votes are basically saying don't count me Don't count me.

298
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,365
Scott: Do not find one less representative for you.

299
00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:51,950
Rym: I can imagine the census 2010.

300
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:55,123
Rym: They're like, yeah, there are only eight people living in Kentucky.

301
00:18:55,143 --> 00:19:00,336
Rym: Well, they only get one seat this year But we got two senators.

302
00:19:00,396 --> 00:19:04,550
Rym: though if you're a punk kid and you have free time you need a job work for the census.

303
00:19:04,691 --> 00:19:05,277
Rym: It's badass.

304
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:07,714
Rym: I still have my badge Not on purpose.

305
00:19:07,734 --> 00:19:10,568
Rym: I actually lost it and got another one because you have to give the badge back.

306
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,097
Rym: Obviously It's like the scary-looking federal government badge.

307
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:13,538
Rym: Mm-hmm.

308
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:16,990
Rym: And then I found like three or four years ago the one I'd lost.

309
00:19:17,474 --> 00:19:18,829
Rym: Uh-huh, so I've got it.

310
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:22,870
Rym: I'm not gonna scan it in or show it to anyone because I shouldn't have it but it's really cool.

311
00:19:23,314 --> 00:19:24,306
Rym: Got a federal seal on it.

312
00:19:24,751 --> 00:19:27,430
Rym: If I ever really need to scam someone that thing will so come in handy.

313
00:19:28,171 --> 00:19:36,888
Scott: You could go and pretend to be a census worker right now and then someone like it visited twice And then I'll probably get visited by the FBI Probably.

314
00:19:38,172 --> 00:19:47,350
Rym: But if you're a nerd and you don't have time to work for the census Go check out all their open-source API data sets and do something cool like a mashup with Google Maps or something Google charts.

315
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:48,267
Rym: Oh, yeah.

316
00:19:54,924 --> 00:19:56,613
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

317
00:19:56,734 --> 00:19:57,820
Rym: before we get into the things of the day.

318
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,600
Rym: We were at a pretty cool gizmodo thing in the city over the weekend.

319
00:20:02,082 --> 00:20:15,939
Scott: Oh, yeah gizmodo the website had this gizmodo gallery sort of a temporary mini museum Downtown in New York City, so, you know, we were in town for the New York Anime Festival on Saturday and we're like Hey, let's go down and check this gizmodo gallery while it's there.

320
00:20:16,462 --> 00:20:19,474
Scott: So we go down and check it out and it was well worth our time.

321
00:20:19,634 --> 00:20:20,217
Rym: the coolest thing.

322
00:20:20,237 --> 00:20:21,020
Rym: We're walking tomorrow day.

323
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,764
Rym: We weren't like.

324
00:20:21,784 --> 00:20:24,480
Rym: we knew pretty much where it was, but we didn't know like exactly.

325
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,120
Rym: So we're walking down the street and we see a crowd outside a building.

326
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,987
Scott: We're like that must be it.

327
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:35,500
Rym: and as we walk up in the distance We hear music and the first thing I think is that sounds a lot like Tesla coils and we get there.

328
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:37,379
Rym: There's a Tesla coil concert going on.

329
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:43,964
Rym: yeah, and the funny thing is you know, we just Emily and Alex had come with us to PAX and as we're walking up we See this crowd Emily's like.

330
00:20:44,526 --> 00:20:48,500
Rym: that looks a lot like the crowd from PAX and I'm like, that's probably the gizmodo crowd.

331
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,139
Rym: It's mostly the same kind of crowd.

332
00:20:50,593 --> 00:20:55,160
Rym: Yep All these hipster looking people wearing black and geeky t-shirts and being all hip.

333
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,955
Rym: Everyone has like all their smartphones out taking pictures of the Tesla coils.

334
00:20:59,356 --> 00:21:00,320
Scott: That's the PAX crowd.

335
00:21:00,501 --> 00:21:01,806
Rym: There was some really cool stuff there.

336
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,080
Rym: I the mud computer the the first Walkman.

337
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:11,420
Scott: Yeah, the first Walkman ever one of the first VCRs ever like this engineering model from JVC.

338
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:13,485
Scott: All sorts of crazy.

339
00:21:13,546 --> 00:21:17,100
Rym: I gotta say the first Walkman was surprisingly impressive.

340
00:21:17,281 --> 00:21:19,932
Rym: It was awesome primarily because you look at it and you're like you.

341
00:21:19,952 --> 00:21:21,760
Rym: think about the Walkman like when we got him.

342
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,799
Scott: It was one of the better Walkman though Some of the later ones were cheap and crappy.

343
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:27,690
Scott: Sitting with Discman like I had this awesome old Discman.

344
00:21:28,011 --> 00:21:30,760
Scott: but over time the Discman they just made him shittier and shittier.

345
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:31,669
Scott: They didn't make them better.

346
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:41,131
Rym: the original Walkman When the further revolution of the world when people were like carry music with you is So small and well engineered that today.

347
00:21:41,211 --> 00:21:43,780
Rym: I would not feel that bad carrying something that lot size around.

348
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,729
Scott: It's made of metal.

349
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:45,800
Scott: serious business.

350
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:52,499
Scott: The original iPod has an actual wheel that actually spins, you know, the first Walkman's and even continuing.

351
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:57,780
Rym: in Japan They just by default had two ports for headphones in case you wanted to share music with a friend.

352
00:21:58,182 --> 00:21:59,629
Rym: Where the fuck is that on my iPod?

353
00:21:59,729 --> 00:22:00,231
Scott: That's right.

354
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:01,960
Rym: I got to use some crap splitter.

355
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:10,030
Scott: Yep, I mean it would take up some room in that incredibly small iPod, but even so I mean, you know It doesn't have that much room.

356
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:10,796
Scott: It's totally worth it.

357
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:12,926
Rym: Yep Anyway, it was cool.

358
00:22:12,946 --> 00:22:13,772
Rym: I don't know what else I can say.

359
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:14,960
Rym: We'll link to like a gallery.

360
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,427
Rym: I mean, I didn't take any pictures.

361
00:22:16,688 --> 00:22:18,980
Rym: There were so many people with smartphones taking pictures.

362
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:26,167
Scott: Yeah, one cool thing they had was a little stand where you could try out all the best of each Smartphone one for each operating system.

363
00:22:26,187 --> 00:22:27,191
Scott: So there's six smartphones.

364
00:22:27,492 --> 00:22:29,720
Rym: I love techie people, you know anime cons, whatever.

365
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:37,300
Rym: But at this kind, you know at this little gallery event I stood there and debated with like four people the merits of all the phones for like ten minutes and everyone was smart.

366
00:22:37,922 --> 00:22:39,347
Scott: They had a 3d Etch A Sketch.

367
00:22:39,407 --> 00:22:41,736
Rym: They had a 3d Etch A Sketch were surprisingly cool.

368
00:22:41,756 --> 00:22:42,860
Scott: They had a machine that made pancakes.

369
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:46,605
Rym: They had a fancy In the back in the back.

370
00:22:46,645 --> 00:22:47,569
Scott: They were just playing.

371
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:49,556
Scott: they're playing rock bad Beatles rock band.

372
00:22:49,596 --> 00:22:50,520
Scott: and I was like, why is it?

373
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,965
Scott: What is special about this?

374
00:22:52,106 --> 00:22:53,572
Scott: Why are they just playing Beatles rock band?

375
00:22:53,613 --> 00:22:54,296
Scott: who gives a crap?

376
00:22:54,738 --> 00:22:58,912
Scott: and then I'm like The TV is like a hundred inches plus.

377
00:22:59,012 --> 00:23:01,040
Rym: it was like this gigantic plasma screen.

378
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,169
Rym: It was one of those beautiful things I've ever seen in my life.

379
00:23:03,189 --> 00:23:05,640
Scott: It's like the biggest fucking television in the universe.

380
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,644
Scott: I was like, holy shit.

381
00:23:06,744 --> 00:23:08,912
Scott: I didn't like you don't realize it cuz just like a TV.

382
00:23:08,932 --> 00:23:14,860
Rym: I was like, oh, it's a TV Yep, and right next to them was the dude playing the laser guitar.

383
00:23:15,121 --> 00:23:18,471
Scott: There's a guitar that you play it by this for laser beams and you break them.

384
00:23:18,872 --> 00:23:23,311
Rym: actually way back when I was making a DDR pad I Sketched out everything I would need.

385
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:24,560
Rym: I didn't build it cuz I didn't have the money.

386
00:23:25,183 --> 00:23:27,193
Rym: But remember I made that shitty as DDR pad.

387
00:23:27,213 --> 00:23:28,037
Rym: I eventually got rid of yep.

388
00:23:28,766 --> 00:23:36,904
Rym: well I had this idea make a laser DDR pad a DDR pad where the arrows were all recessed and just put lasers and you know Mirrors and sensors.

389
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:37,567
Scott: go for it.

390
00:23:37,828 --> 00:23:39,093
Rym: And now I have the money.

391
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:39,957
Rym: I might just do it.

392
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:40,740
Scott: go for it.

393
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,623
Scott: It'd be totally awesome.

394
00:23:41,644 --> 00:23:42,507
Rym: What do you mean that hard to do?

395
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:43,310
Rym: I mean that DDR pad.

396
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:50,569
Rym: I was not that Technologically or Carpentarily proficient back then, you know you could do.

397
00:23:50,689 --> 00:23:53,360
Scott: actually you can make the DDR pad like nice and like, you know.

398
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,500
Scott: Instead of being metal you could make it like a nice like a just like like a dance floor surface.

399
00:23:58,002 --> 00:23:59,949
Scott: If you did that it has to move.

400
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:01,394
Rym: it would have to be recessed though.

401
00:24:01,434 --> 00:24:04,460
Rym: where all the things are It's just slightly so though.

402
00:24:04,662 --> 00:24:11,200
Rym: The other problem is that there's one Dancing technique you can't do which is where you leave your foot down and just like lift up the pressure and put go back down.

403
00:24:11,963 --> 00:24:15,860
Scott: You could you just plan to put the laser real low now because you have to still lift your foot?

404
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,362
Rym: I would not.

405
00:24:16,563 --> 00:24:17,970
Rym: I would often when I play DDR.

406
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,059
Rym: My foot does not actually leave the pad.

407
00:24:21,421 --> 00:24:22,566
Rym: Mmm, it would be cool though.

408
00:24:22,606 --> 00:24:24,293
Rym: It's something maybe I'm doing.

409
00:24:24,393 --> 00:24:24,755
Rym: I don't know.

410
00:24:25,337 --> 00:24:25,980
Rym: I just thought it was cool.

411
00:24:26,322 --> 00:24:27,449
Rym: I have an actual thing of the day.

412
00:24:28,012 --> 00:24:28,978
Rym: So number way back.

413
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:32,090
Rym: I don't know how impressed Scott will be by this but I was there.

414
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:35,120
Rym: I had that that Martin Luther King auto-tune.

415
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:38,320
Rym: That was actually I thought pretty good and pretty inspiring.

416
00:24:39,002 --> 00:24:41,048
Rym: All right, I thought it was pretty cool.

417
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:44,559
Rym: it made me I don't know very hopeful very very happy was a cool thing.

418
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:47,831
Rym: and You know suddenly people were making a ton of these things.

419
00:24:47,972 --> 00:24:52,895
Scott: auto-tune is like the new hotness What exact like where all these people getting the auto-tune from?

420
00:24:52,955 --> 00:24:53,598
Rym: you just buy it.

421
00:24:53,638 --> 00:24:56,534
Scott: It's software Yeah, but I mean people obviously are not paying for it.

422
00:24:57,459 --> 00:24:58,343
Rym: Uh Maybe I don't know.

423
00:24:58,403 --> 00:24:59,869
Rym: I didn't check the Pirate Bay.

424
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:02,499
Scott: I see like what is the name of the program auto-tune?

425
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:02,860
Scott: Really?

426
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,725
Scott: Yeah, that's just it.

427
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:07,032
Rym: Okay, I could talk We just not get into it.

428
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,740
Rym: I could talk forever.

429
00:25:08,262 --> 00:25:10,875
Rym: We will do a Monday show cuz we haven't done anything like this a while.

430
00:25:10,915 --> 00:25:11,800
Rym: and on auto-tune?

431
00:25:12,061 --> 00:25:14,472
Rym: Well, no on vocoders and auto-tune and all that stuff.

432
00:25:14,673 --> 00:25:15,015
Scott: Okay.

433
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:16,522
Scott: I don't know anything about that I do.

434
00:25:17,104 --> 00:25:22,266
Rym: I thought of that because Scott was trying to get me to do a show on DRBD and all this like cool Like shared file system stuff.

435
00:25:22,307 --> 00:25:23,070
Rym: I don't know.

436
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,240
Rym: I want to know about yeah, and I'll do a show on it.

437
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,160
Rym: But I haven't been working on that stuff lately.

438
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,991
Rym: I've been writing bullshit Java code instead.

439
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:30,259
Rym: so I gotta go look at my configs.

440
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:34,753
Rym: But that aside someone put together an auto-tune.

441
00:25:34,773 --> 00:25:41,659
Rym: that is basically a tribute to Carl Sagan who is One of the few people that I would really honestly consider a hero in this world.

442
00:25:42,202 --> 00:25:46,744
Rym: Carl Sagan is just the man to a degree that you know None of you will ever.

443
00:25:46,905 --> 00:25:50,780
Scott: none of us will ever obtain the same guy did both of these or a different guy?

444
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:51,924
Rym: I have no idea.

445
00:25:51,944 --> 00:25:56,600
Rym: I did no research out what that so ever but I watched this like four times and was deeply inspired.

446
00:25:57,283 --> 00:26:01,060
Rym: The sky calls to us if we do not destroy ourselves we will one day venture to the stars.

447
00:26:01,441 --> 00:26:05,935
Rym: I'll still more glory as dawn awaits not a sunrise but a galaxy unless you already missed our chance.

448
00:26:06,336 --> 00:26:15,740
Rym: Yeah, I'll do a hypothesis But seriously Carl Sagan for a whole generation of people before Scott and I and all of us.

449
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:32,820
Rym: You know our generation a whole generation of people became scientists And if you ask them it is pretty much straight up because they watched Carl Sagan's cosmos or they read Carl Sagan's cosmos and We need more people to watch and read Carl Sagan's cosmos and be interested in science.

450
00:26:33,243 --> 00:26:34,632
Scott: Yeah, not enough science going on.

451
00:26:34,854 --> 00:26:35,257
Rym: seriously.

452
00:26:35,317 --> 00:26:35,700
Rym: watch this.

453
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:41,060
Scott: It is very inspiring and even people who are smart enough to listen to GeekNights are not understanding the science so much.

454
00:26:42,621 --> 00:26:45,973
Scott: That's all I've got all right, so this isn't a big thing of the day.

455
00:26:45,993 --> 00:26:47,639
Scott: It's just sort of you know little thing.

456
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:53,756
Scott: Basically, you know that the new browsers with the HTML 5 they're all gonna have the canvas element.

457
00:26:53,796 --> 00:27:02,151
Scott: some of them already have the canvas Element but not all of them, but eventually they all will and the canvas element basically says hey web browser Make a square and inside that square.

458
00:27:02,191 --> 00:27:04,823
Scott: I'm gonna draw shit, and I'm gonna draw whatever the hell I want now.

459
00:27:04,943 --> 00:27:05,545
Rym: is that not?

460
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:09,879
Rym: the web developers dream the pixel placement on the screen right.

461
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:11,843
Rym: well It's not almost rhymed I'm mostly.

462
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,913
Scott: what it is is something they compete with flash right.

463
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:17,973
Scott: so you can make a game in there Or you can make you know some sort of animation in there.

464
00:27:17,993 --> 00:27:18,898
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

465
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:22,840
Scott: The thing is this you can't really do 3d in there easily.

466
00:27:23,471 --> 00:27:24,754
Rym: You can do it in that GIMP way.

467
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:27,400
Scott: Yeah, some people have done like Wolfenstein 3d in there.

468
00:27:27,641 --> 00:27:34,179
Scott: You know which is sort of - you know you use 2d to make 3d But basically you're gonna have to write all the 3d code on your own.

469
00:27:34,642 --> 00:27:36,111
Scott: You know cuz it's it's you.

470
00:27:36,151 --> 00:27:40,140
Rym: all you have are the 2d drawing tool And you don't want to do that for anything other than an exercise.

471
00:27:40,381 --> 00:27:41,524
Rym: I mean seriously.

472
00:27:41,784 --> 00:27:47,600
Scott: so now in the latest Firefox nightly build right they have web GL.

473
00:27:47,882 --> 00:27:49,940
Scott: So you can do OpenGL in the canvas.

474
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:55,780
Scott: 3d in the browser no plugins no nothing just a box.

475
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,028
Scott: And then you do 3d in it and they had the demo.

476
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:09,189
Scott: it has the spar like a spore creature rendered inside one of these canvas boxes, so Yeah, all those things that like add 3d to the browser.

477
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:13,482
Scott: You know like you know quake live and such not gonna need that in The future.

478
00:28:13,563 --> 00:28:15,975
Scott: we're just gonna you know 3d game right in the browser.

479
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:16,578
Scott: No flash.

480
00:28:16,658 --> 00:28:17,060
Scott: No nothing.

481
00:28:17,221 --> 00:28:18,487
Scott: I'm looking forward to it.

482
00:28:18,688 --> 00:28:20,658
Scott: probably a couple years out everyone will have it.

483
00:28:21,582 --> 00:28:27,140
Rym: So without further ado it's time for the totally cop-out tech news round.

484
00:28:27,804 --> 00:28:36,590
Rym: Oh, I feel like I should play some roundup music or something like you know like Like Western roundup, I think so all right.

485
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:37,032
Scott: That's all.

486
00:28:37,072 --> 00:28:37,895
Scott: you go find some.

487
00:28:37,955 --> 00:28:39,300
Rym: that's not happening, okay?

488
00:28:40,502 --> 00:28:41,065
Scott: You want to start?

489
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:44,727
Scott: you got a tech news or you want me to go for tech news real quick I want to talk about.

490
00:28:44,828 --> 00:28:47,324
Rym: you know this is slightly old news But I have something.

491
00:28:47,766 --> 00:28:49,573
Rym: but remember news whatever.

492
00:28:49,613 --> 00:28:54,500
Rym: we're more about commentary here on GeekNights But stack overflow which people have been saying they should do this forever.

493
00:28:54,721 --> 00:28:58,740
Scott: I want to make up first of all that people know there is a website called stack overflow.

494
00:28:59,261 --> 00:29:03,252
Scott: The website is basically you might know a website called experts exchange.

495
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:06,160
Rym: right I believe you mean experts exchange exactly.

496
00:29:06,482 --> 00:29:10,305
Scott: It's a website where basically tech people ask questions And then they answer.

497
00:29:10,486 --> 00:29:11,972
Scott: other tech people answer the question.

498
00:29:11,992 --> 00:29:15,317
Scott: so if you need tech help you go there And you ask or you answer.

499
00:29:15,438 --> 00:29:18,794
Scott: and The thing is the site requires money to get into.

500
00:29:18,995 --> 00:29:20,020
Scott: it's not a free site.

501
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:25,531
Scott: So basically the obvious idea was hey Why doesn't someone just make a free experts exchange?

502
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:28,347
Scott: and while someone did it's called stack overflow And it's way better.

503
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:34,933
Scott: in addition to being free They also made two other sites server fault calm and super user calm.

504
00:29:35,394 --> 00:29:45,743
Scott: stack overflow is really just for programming questions Server fall is for IT questions and super user is for all the other sorts of computer questions that are not for stack overflow Or server fault.

505
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:46,707
Rym: so they did.

506
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:54,151
Rym: what everyone's been clamoring for them to do forever is now They have made something that is basically stack overflow for everything.

507
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:55,455
Rym: stack exchange right.

508
00:29:55,495 --> 00:30:02,560
Scott: so the way stack exchange is basically Hey, you punk kid whoever you are do you want to make your own question and answer site?

509
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,524
Scott: Maybe for gaming?

510
00:30:03,905 --> 00:30:11,160
Scott: maybe for board games maybe for anime Maybe for bottle railroads, maybe for carpentry.

511
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:15,435
Scott: You give us money And we will let you make a website.

512
00:30:15,515 --> 00:30:20,234
Scott: that is the same Software and stack overflow only for whatever your topic happens to be.

513
00:30:20,354 --> 00:30:26,940
Rym: so I'm going to say straight up This is a terrible idea that is going to fail miserably and be a footnote in internet history at best.

514
00:30:27,214 --> 00:30:28,263
Scott: Yeah I think that you know.

515
00:30:28,484 --> 00:30:37,755
Rym: if this is going to collapse this for the same reason that dig and reddit and Basically everything else that is for a lot side wiki which failed before we even started.

516
00:30:37,775 --> 00:30:38,677
Scott: we're gonna talk about that.

517
00:30:38,818 --> 00:30:39,420
Rym: Oh my god.

518
00:30:40,282 --> 00:30:41,591
Scott: So yeah, I agree with you.

519
00:30:41,611 --> 00:30:42,840
Scott: That is not a good idea.

520
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:47,540
Scott: And the reason what you know one guy I was listening to stack is the reason why is such a depressing reason?

521
00:30:48,202 --> 00:30:51,716
Scott: Well, I was listening to the stack overflow podcast right and basically you know.

522
00:30:51,757 --> 00:30:57,518
Scott: you got Jeff Atwood Who's the guy who made the stack overflow with some other people and you got Joel Spolsky who sort of a?

523
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,407
Scott: Infamous character in the software development world.

524
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:04,800
Scott: right and the Joel Spolsky is the guy who's running the business part of you know.

525
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,770
Scott: But the stack exchange where is the Jeff that would?

526
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:12,345
Scott: he's just doing the stack overflow and basically It's like you know.

527
00:31:12,546 --> 00:31:21,399
Scott: Jeff wanted to open-source stack overflow eventually not now but eventually and Joel was like no you can never do it then my stack exchange won't make any money ever.

528
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:33,380
Scott: and I think that basically they're a fool for trying the stack exchange model because number one they're charging way too much money Right and no one who pays that much money for one of these sites is gonna make that much money back.

529
00:31:33,961 --> 00:31:38,876
Scott: Right I mean no stack overflow site is ever gonna be as big as the original stack overflow.

530
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:48,880
Scott: and two Right they should have just open-sourced it and made money the WordPress way whereas WordPress is making a lot more money than stack overflow is gonna make with the stack exchange.

531
00:31:49,061 --> 00:31:52,739
Rym: Well the two reasons why I believe it's just going to fail outright is that one?

532
00:31:53,602 --> 00:31:59,680
Rym: Dig only worked sadly when it was primarily a walled garden of the kind of the technological elite.

533
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,227
Rym: there was this high barrier to entry.

534
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:07,838
Rym: only like the really techie hit people were there and These were people who generally wouldn't shit cock all over everything mm-hmm.

535
00:32:08,501 --> 00:32:20,315
Rym: And there are a million sites that you know like wiki answers and Google answers and Yahoo answers and all this stuff and they all Basically devolve into garbage unless they're continuously pruned and monitored by human.

536
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,940
Scott: well stack overflow is continued.

537
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:30,620
Rym: It's crowdsource to the same Relatively technological people and it caters to this very specific focus group.

538
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,174
Scott: Yeah Well, I think you understand that stack exchange is not is separate from stack or I do it like.

539
00:32:35,214 --> 00:32:36,840
Scott: stack overflow won't be ruined by.

540
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:46,940
Rym: I think stack exchange is in and of itself cannot possibly succeed because What experts are you gonna get in all these fields who are also technologically competent?

541
00:32:47,562 --> 00:32:59,277
Rym: And you're just gonna get people shit cocking if anything and even if you avoid the problem that any Collaborative internet with 2.0 kind of thing has if you ever get them non technological masses to use.

542
00:32:59,337 --> 00:33:07,633
Rym: it is The problem that very few fields outside of science math and technology Have such specific questions with clear.

543
00:33:07,814 --> 00:33:08,658
Rym: that is the answer.

544
00:33:08,758 --> 00:33:14,900
Rym: answers Yeah, I mean in IT or you know I write like how do I make a script to do X in Python?

545
00:33:15,406 --> 00:33:18,707
Rym: There's one answer Maybe two answers.

546
00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:19,290
Scott: Yep.

547
00:33:19,471 --> 00:33:21,279
Rym: How do I monitor this as an MP thing?

548
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,600
Scott: Or at least if there are multiple answers, they are either right or wrong.

549
00:33:24,901 --> 00:33:27,791
Scott: There is no like questionable if they might be right or wrong.

550
00:33:27,911 --> 00:33:28,855
Scott: They're they're working.

551
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:30,420
Rym: They don't I mean somewhat.

552
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,244
Rym: What's someone gonna ask?

553
00:33:31,285 --> 00:33:32,994
Rym: How do I kayak right?

554
00:33:33,114 --> 00:33:34,079
Rym: What kayak do I buy?

555
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:39,200
Scott: There's no objective answer to that and Yahoo answers sort of covers that kind of crap.

556
00:33:39,301 --> 00:33:42,260
Rym: But I think we should move right on from this and decide wiki if that's something you were gonna bring.

557
00:33:42,682 --> 00:33:47,222
Scott: But one more thing about this right is that even if you're not you're taught You know.

558
00:33:47,282 --> 00:33:51,234
Scott: regardless of the fact that you know the question of yes There are answers or no there aren't.

559
00:33:51,860 --> 00:34:03,069
Scott: Tech people sit at the computer all day Like if you're going from model railroad questions a guy who's working on his model railroad doesn't have you know a computer right there That he's gonna You know rush to every time he has a problem.

560
00:34:03,571 --> 00:34:09,158
Scott: tech people are sitting at the computer when we have a problem We google it and stack overflow shows up in the Google results.

561
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,687
Scott: Model railroad exchange.

562
00:34:11,887 --> 00:34:13,011
Scott: right that ain't gonna happen.

563
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,100
Scott: model railroad guys aren't sitting at the computer while they're model railroading.

564
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:18,838
Scott: They're in a room with the table with the railroad on it.

565
00:34:19,261 --> 00:34:25,348
Scott: So unless they you know you make the user interface for your website a train It's not gonna work so well.

566
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:28,600
Rym: and also I mean think of this in general guy is the problem kayaking?

567
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,324
Scott: He's out in the water on a boat.

568
00:34:30,886 --> 00:34:35,699
Rym: a programmer knows how to ask a question that another programmer can answer.

569
00:34:36,681 --> 00:34:38,505
Scott: Usually you'd be surprised in Stack Overflow.

570
00:34:38,525 --> 00:34:39,329
Scott: pretty bad questions.

571
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:41,616
Scott: Yeah, they also Google all their problems.

572
00:34:41,777 --> 00:34:49,719
Scott: other professions Like carpenters don't Google all their problems the way programmers do so it's just by that very nature.

573
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,665
Scott: It's not gonna work, so well.

574
00:34:50,685 --> 00:34:52,253
Scott: I think a gaming one might work.

575
00:34:52,313 --> 00:34:57,580
Scott: Well it might work, okay For tips and tricks kinds of things like how do I beat this part true?

576
00:34:57,801 --> 00:35:00,660
Scott: And I think that could do it really do a good competition with game facts.

577
00:35:00,741 --> 00:35:01,869
Rym: Oh, it could destroy game facts.

578
00:35:01,889 --> 00:35:03,319
Rym: honestly game facts has to die.

579
00:35:04,022 --> 00:35:05,185
Rym: The culture of their.

580
00:35:05,426 --> 00:35:07,914
Rym: you know text only ASCII file are.

581
00:35:08,335 --> 00:35:09,940
Rym: the whole culture of game facts is just crap.

582
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,648
Scott: Hey, why don't we make a game fax is better?

583
00:35:11,668 --> 00:35:12,512
Scott: I mean we could.

584
00:35:12,592 --> 00:35:14,340
Scott: you know it doesn't even have to be Stack Overflow.

585
00:35:14,441 --> 00:35:15,085
Scott: Let's just be like.

586
00:35:15,105 --> 00:35:23,966
Rym: hey, that'd be really you know unlike every other idea We've ever had that would take like a month of us doing it like hardly at all Put it in the hopper.

587
00:35:24,308 --> 00:35:26,340
Rym: Yeah, yeah, but we could put it near the top of the hopper.

588
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:28,910
Rym: It's much easier to do than our global currency.

589
00:35:29,392 --> 00:35:30,877
Scott: Yeah, that has to wait.

590
00:35:30,897 --> 00:35:31,500
Rym: Yeah, it does.

591
00:35:32,405 --> 00:35:37,603
Scott: So yeah you want to talk about this, so here's the side wiki right basically 1994 called.

592
00:35:37,644 --> 00:35:39,128
Rym: they want their idea back right.

593
00:35:39,168 --> 00:35:45,092
Scott: basically the idea is an old idea, and I've seen at least two or three implementations of this idea.

594
00:35:45,112 --> 00:35:48,320
Scott: and the idea is this Why do we need to have comments?

595
00:35:48,561 --> 00:36:00,360
Scott: You know on the websites what we can do is we can just have some separate commenting system where people comment on URLs And then you visit the URL and then your browser will load up the comments for that URL.

596
00:36:00,703 --> 00:36:09,460
Scott: So basically everyone is commenting on the web Sites all in one place and you can comment on any site on the whole net whether the site has comments or not.

597
00:36:09,963 --> 00:36:11,090
Scott: And it's an okay idea.

598
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:11,673
Rym: it well.

599
00:36:11,714 --> 00:36:12,760
Rym: It's at least in theory.

600
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:23,700
Rym: It's a great idea in theory because one there are a lot of times where there's something discussion worthy But many times people with certain agendas will not want anyone to comment in a way that can be associated with their content.

601
00:36:23,952 --> 00:36:24,099
Rym: Yep.

602
00:36:24,862 --> 00:36:27,911
Rym: And two it's a great way to like crowds.

603
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:33,940
Rym: you basically would let you in a in the pre masses internet though it before the long November.

604
00:36:35,061 --> 00:36:42,079
Rym: You basically could have had the internet the way Tim Berners-Lee imagined it mm-hmm, but now that could never happen.

605
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,344
Rym: no It's just impossible.

606
00:36:43,485 --> 00:36:45,734
Scott: so the thing is basically everyone who's implemented this.

607
00:36:45,774 --> 00:36:47,240
Scott: I've saw one a long time ago.

608
00:36:47,321 --> 00:36:50,979
Scott: That was like a Firefox extension And it would open up a sidebar in your Firefox.

609
00:36:51,522 --> 00:36:55,000
Rym: One of the earliest ones was you could stick post-it notes to websites that were translucent.

610
00:36:55,182 --> 00:36:57,200
Rym: You could bring them in and out and move them around.

611
00:36:57,341 --> 00:37:03,732
Scott: So Google's got basically the same thing again called side wiki and the biggest problem I have with it is you need Google toolbar to use it.

612
00:37:03,753 --> 00:37:05,180
Scott: It's like fuck Google toolbar.

613
00:37:05,346 --> 00:37:13,200
Rym: Yeah I don't want a fucking toolbar just to add this one lousy feature Right and two they say like moderation and all this stuff is coming already too late.

614
00:37:13,462 --> 00:37:14,270
Rym: You've got to have that right.

615
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,124
Scott: you gotta have that right away It's no good.

616
00:37:16,465 --> 00:37:20,464
Scott: and the second thing they call it side wiki is not a wiki It's just comments.

617
00:37:20,624 --> 00:37:24,420
Rym: if it was any other people's comments if it was a wiki that'd be great of course.

618
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,914
Rym: It would just be the cockboat on every website of course of course.

619
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,864
Rym: see the real problem here What.

620
00:37:29,904 --> 00:37:31,011
Rym: but well now there are two things.

621
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:32,239
Rym: the real problem is that again?

622
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,610
Rym: To be perfectly blunt and to use the you know angry video game.

623
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:39,127
Rym: there the masses shit all over everything And there's no way to stop them.

624
00:37:39,449 --> 00:37:45,937
Rym: Yeah, but that aside Most of the people who are against this are not against it for any of the reasons.

625
00:37:45,977 --> 00:37:46,500
Rym: We've brought up.

626
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,760
Scott: No, they're against it because they don't want someone to comment on their no comment site and all like that.

627
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,880
Scott: You know like a news website that forces you to log in to comment there.

628
00:37:54,181 --> 00:38:05,125
Scott: They don't want you leaving a comment so that someone visits there like you know New York Times And then suddenly the side wiki opens up And it says shit cock shit cock poop poop poop plus back in the day You know these post-it note things.

629
00:38:05,466 --> 00:38:06,128
Rym: they got sued.

630
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:09,604
Rym: everyone got like sued or threatened to be sued by anyone who would be affected by This.

631
00:38:09,726 --> 00:38:10,479
Scott: it's vandalism.

632
00:38:11,241 --> 00:38:18,884
Rym: All I have to say these people is that They have no more right to the metadata that is associated with their site But not on their site.

633
00:38:19,426 --> 00:38:20,308
Rym: then they have to.

634
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:23,297
Rym: I don't know me talking about their website exactly.

635
00:38:23,317 --> 00:38:23,979
Rym: That's all it is.

636
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,948
Rym: Yep, it's just a website, but the thing is what it.

637
00:38:27,509 --> 00:38:30,658
Rym: it's almost what web 3.0 is going to be.

638
00:38:30,939 --> 00:38:35,600
Rym: you know People talk a lot about what web 2.0 was and I think we all generally agree what that is.

639
00:38:36,543 --> 00:38:37,205
Rym: No one really agrees.

640
00:38:37,225 --> 00:38:42,019
Rym: know what web 3.0 is a lot of people use stupid BS phrases like the semantic web or whatever.

641
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:51,862
Rym: I Think web 3.0 is going to be when every computer is basically serving and receiving content in pretty much equal amounts Mmm.

642
00:38:52,123 --> 00:38:56,620
Rym: That's going to be when there are no more IPs, but that IP v6 and all those things.

643
00:38:56,681 --> 00:39:01,110
Rym: It'll be the day when there are not Monolithic gigantic web servers.

644
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,940
Rym: it is just everything is kind of peer-to-peer.

645
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:08,345
Rym: Everyone's a publisher and everyone's a receiver and It's actually a cloud.

646
00:39:08,386 --> 00:39:09,268
Rym: It's actually a web.

647
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:11,294
Scott: It'd be the federated cloud where it's like.

648
00:39:11,334 --> 00:39:13,320
Scott: you don't have you know the Twitter server.

649
00:39:13,441 --> 00:39:14,044
Scott: It's everyone.

650
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:16,940
Scott: You know it's more the Laconica model even though the Laconica itself sucks.

651
00:39:17,062 --> 00:39:26,654
Scott: It has the correct Architecture where every every community or whatever runs their own little server And then the servers federate and such or every person or a family runs their own server.

652
00:39:26,674 --> 00:39:28,420
Scott: the world where everyone has their own.

653
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:39,304
Scott: Instead of one big storm cloud Everyone has their own little tiny personal cloud And then all the clouds can sort of send lightning back and forth like even to agree like Google Wave will probably go a long Way toward that.

654
00:39:39,345 --> 00:39:48,060
Rym: but even the idea that that web browsers This is the one area web browsers can change fundamentally to where instead of being primarily a get pages and interact with them.

655
00:39:48,462 --> 00:39:51,020
Rym: They are a share information and receive information.

656
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,587
Scott: Well doesn't the new opera have that?

657
00:39:52,647 --> 00:39:55,740
Scott: it's a web server and a web browser to serve various things.

658
00:39:55,921 --> 00:39:58,340
Rym: Yeah, I haven't played with it yet, so I don't want to talk about it.

659
00:39:58,401 --> 00:40:06,580
Rym: I think it does have that though, but Extrude that into the future and that is what I would call web 3.0 because that is the next revolution.

660
00:40:06,883 --> 00:40:09,782
Scott: Yeah, that's what the internet was supposed to be in the beginning But we got.

661
00:40:09,843 --> 00:40:23,969
Rym: it's weird how the people who basically pioneered the internet knew exactly what it should have been and no one's like Everyone's basically moved away from that and now they're finally going back to slowly but surely Thing that really just I keep.

662
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:25,999
Scott: I can't say this enough times, right?

663
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:31,337
Scott: Computers are like 30. some personal computers are at least 30 something years old.

664
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:38,595
Scott: the internet I mean people normal people have add, you know internet access dial-up came around like what 15 years ago.

665
00:40:38,615 --> 00:40:42,070
Scott: Yeah, I mean, right and People are still acting like this.

666
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,520
Scott: shit is new and world-changing.

667
00:40:44,562 --> 00:40:46,169
Scott: Get with the fucking times.

668
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:51,853
Scott: if the computer can do it tough shit It's done game over if you don't realize it by now.

669
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:52,997
Scott: You're never gonna get it.

670
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:53,740
Scott: You're an old geezer.

671
00:40:54,642 --> 00:40:56,350
Scott: Get in the backseat you're done.

672
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,160
Scott: you're not allowed to drive anymore.

673
00:40:59,422 --> 00:41:02,055
Rym: No, because if computers are good enough, you don't have to drive anymore.

674
00:41:02,075 --> 00:41:02,980
Rym: computers do it for you.

675
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:06,696
Scott: The point is if you don't get it by now, I mean look at this newspapers are dying.

676
00:41:06,716 --> 00:41:10,194
Scott: now You it's not like this jumped out as a surprise.

677
00:41:10,395 --> 00:41:13,401
Scott: you had 15.

678
00:41:13,401 --> 00:41:16,712
Scott: Right, oh the music companies and the movie companies, what will they do?

679
00:41:16,712 --> 00:41:17,976
Scott: 15 years?

680
00:41:18,056 --> 00:41:19,240
Scott: That's a long time.

681
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,332
Scott: The music industry Everyone saw this coming.

682
00:41:24,594 --> 00:41:31,513
Scott: Napster was in 1999 10 years ago and you still having a fucking problem Get with it.

683
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:33,406
Rym: We got it.

684
00:41:33,648 --> 00:41:33,930
Rym: We got it.

685
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,060
Rym: There's some topic there.

686
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,560
Rym: We could turn into a show but I'm not sure what other than just kill all the old people.

687
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:41,414
Rym: Hey hot mama, you want to kill all the humans.

688
00:41:41,656 --> 00:41:42,320
Scott: kill all humans.

689
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:46,337
Rym: You realize eventually all humans will be old people compared to the computers.

690
00:41:46,899 --> 00:41:54,015
Rym: good So so this is gonna be Galaxy Express in the end, is that where we're going?

691
00:41:54,296 --> 00:41:55,963
Scott: No, it's gonna be Logan's run All right.

692
00:41:55,983 --> 00:41:56,769
Scott: So all right.

693
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:57,515
Rym: That was your thing.

694
00:41:57,535 --> 00:42:00,765
Rym: I get to do thing Real quick in New Zealand.

695
00:42:01,006 --> 00:42:03,995
Rym: They have banned phones as satellite navigation devices.

696
00:42:04,496 --> 00:42:05,860
Rym: This is ham-fisted bullshit.

697
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,347
Rym: This just reeks of every prayer.

698
00:42:07,709 --> 00:42:08,995
Scott: I'll start with the time 15 years.

699
00:42:10,241 --> 00:42:15,196
Rym: Australia and New Zealand when it comes to technology are a little more than fascist dictatorships.

700
00:42:15,256 --> 00:42:16,520
Rym: It's just a disaster down there.

701
00:42:16,841 --> 00:42:21,500
Rym: The only way it works is that a lot of people seem to just ignore these laws, but think about it.

702
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,308
Rym: They don't want people to be fiddling with their phones and cars.

703
00:42:24,569 --> 00:42:28,140
Rym: So they've banned cell phones as sat-nav devices.

704
00:42:29,181 --> 00:42:31,559
Rym: My son and even if you mount them on the dashboard, right?

705
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,039
Rym: So you have to buy a sat-nav device a dedicated one.

706
00:42:34,502 --> 00:42:40,908
Rym: I think this was lobbying by like Garmin and I think so too because mice, you know The pre the ball the palm free.

707
00:42:41,049 --> 00:42:43,560
Rym: one of the biggest things about it is that they made a deal with spring.

708
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:46,770
Rym: You get for free a sat-nav.

709
00:42:47,071 --> 00:42:48,716
Rym: the same is what you have in your car.

710
00:42:48,736 --> 00:42:52,551
Rym: if you mount that on your dashboard It does everything that one of those Garmin things does.

711
00:42:52,631 --> 00:42:53,796
Rym: it tells you the directions.

712
00:42:54,097 --> 00:42:55,744
Rym: It's all voice It's perfect.

713
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:58,980
Rym: And you know, they just made that illegal in New Zealand because they're stupid.

714
00:42:58,980 --> 00:42:59,944
Rym: I don't have anything else to say.

715
00:43:00,266 --> 00:43:03,420
Rym: people in government retarded unless they work for the census.

716
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:14,083
Scott: Yeah, right where they make nice public domain, you know software packages with nice open API's and everything all right, so I Very very soon.

717
00:43:14,123 --> 00:43:20,900
Scott: It's the month of October and there's something special about October's and April's in that those are the months when Ubuntu appears.

718
00:43:22,721 --> 00:43:26,955
Scott: So but to 910 which is Ubuntu 2009 October.

719
00:43:27,176 --> 00:43:28,079
Rym: is this one gonna be an LTS?

720
00:43:28,642 --> 00:43:30,374
Scott: No, the April's gonna be an LTS.

721
00:43:30,535 --> 00:43:31,279
Rym: I'm gonna hold out then.

722
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:34,300
Scott: So for those you don't know LTS means long-term support.

723
00:43:34,421 --> 00:43:42,120
Scott: That means if you install a long-term support version That means like you can leave it you can use it for like three years and if it's a server five years.

724
00:43:42,581 --> 00:43:48,159
Scott: If it's a regular old version like the one that's coming out real soon is it only gets updates for like 18 months?

725
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:49,929
Scott: I think and then it's game over.

726
00:43:50,049 --> 00:43:51,238
Scott: so you've got to keep.

727
00:43:51,278 --> 00:43:54,339
Scott: you know If you're using every single version of Ubuntu you got to keep upgrading it.

728
00:43:54,621 --> 00:44:03,260
Scott: But if you use an LTS, which is what I would use on a server You just use the LTS and you ignore the other six months, you know, October April releases and you only use the LTS ones.

729
00:44:03,863 --> 00:44:13,000
Scott: Anyway, this this release that's coming out You know, it's got a lot of new goodies goodies all over the place Right, like Firefox three and a half and such, you know.

730
00:44:13,921 --> 00:44:29,400
Scott: One thing it has that I think is the most interesting is the booting is a lot faster like they really really concentrated on the faster booting big time and Basically a long time ago like many releases ago They switched the boot system to this thing called upstart.

731
00:44:30,023 --> 00:44:37,080
Scott: The thing is they didn't really take advantage of it full-on, you know It's like they put it in there, but they didn't really optimize it in the latest release.

732
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:44,115
Scott: They pushed it real real hard And if you have like a solid-state drive your computer's gonna boot in like fucking three seconds.

733
00:44:44,275 --> 00:44:44,997
Scott: It's ludicrous.

734
00:44:45,238 --> 00:44:46,602
Scott: Like I've seen it It's crazy.

735
00:44:47,104 --> 00:44:50,396
Scott: So I really can't wait for that because my laptop has a solid-state drive.

736
00:44:51,078 --> 00:44:55,520
Scott: in addition Phronix, which is this website that is very very Linux nerdy.

737
00:44:56,801 --> 00:45:12,420
Scott: They posted they have this benchmark suite the Phronix test suite and they benchmark the Ubuntu alpha of what's gonna come out Or the beta or whatever it is and they compared it to Free BSD and it basically kicked the shit out of free BSD in all but a few categories.

738
00:45:12,902 --> 00:45:16,172
Scott: So the next Ubuntu is gonna be pretty awesome.

739
00:45:16,272 --> 00:45:25,036
Scott: in addition to you know, the usual updates across the board Also, I saw some screencasts of gnome then like the next like gnome 3.0.

740
00:45:25,036 --> 00:45:26,620
Scott: Whoo big changes.

741
00:45:26,841 --> 00:45:27,303
Rym: Oh good.

742
00:45:27,463 --> 00:45:39,790
Scott: It doesn't look like, you know, I mean, you know a lot of time you look around at you know Like Linux desktops like a man they're copying OS X man, they're copying Windows this gnome 3. it's got like stuff I never even seen before.

743
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:41,060
Scott: I don't even know if I like it or not.

744
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:48,128
Scott: I got to use it before I can decide but I'll show you after the the show real quick like some of the stuff they Added like one particular thing is.

745
00:45:48,188 --> 00:45:51,480
Scott: I think I'd have this whole like peek behind the desktop functionality.

746
00:45:52,261 --> 00:45:58,360
Scott: It sort of reminds me of Windows 3.1 but not and it's like it looks like some of it was borrowed from the netbook remix.

747
00:45:58,541 --> 00:46:03,699
Scott: I don't know what's going on, but it's a big change and Excited just to try out something new.

748
00:46:05,105 --> 00:46:09,740
Rym: So I want to just mention The the reddit issue because it's hilarious.

749
00:46:10,641 --> 00:46:11,204
Rym: Here's there's.

750
00:46:11,244 --> 00:46:14,540
Scott: there's been a lot of these attacks recently on a wide variety of sites.

751
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,884
Scott: Is there to pull off?

752
00:46:16,045 --> 00:46:18,131
Scott: Yep, but shitty security.

753
00:46:18,532 --> 00:46:21,220
Rym: Here's the link from slashdot.

754
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:28,140
Rym: I'm going to read the the the headline of this article, which is actually on reddit and I quote what the fuck just happened.

755
00:46:28,601 --> 00:46:33,295
Rym: I opened a comment thread in Firefox and my braids my browser went crazy and posted all this shit.

756
00:46:33,716 --> 00:46:34,378
Rym: What the fuck?

757
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:36,603
Scott: Yeah Basically the sit.

758
00:46:36,664 --> 00:46:38,612
Scott: I'll explain the technology of the situation.

759
00:46:38,672 --> 00:46:39,536
Rym: It's really simple.

760
00:46:39,576 --> 00:46:40,620
Rym: what they did, right?

761
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,620
Scott: So basically a cross-site scripting attack, right?

762
00:46:43,701 --> 00:46:44,699
Scott: Is where you put?

763
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:47,026
Scott: JavaScripts onto someone else's website?

764
00:46:47,106 --> 00:46:52,100
Scott: or you have JavaScripts on your website that do something to someone else's website or something along these lines.

765
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:57,900
Scott: Right, especially JavaScripts that are that are affecting your website, even though you didn't write them.

766
00:46:59,161 --> 00:47:10,980
Scott: Basically what happens is a JavaScript like that, you know because of Ajax and various things can like can do things like post Comments or you know anything like a user can do with JavaScript can be done to the site.

767
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:14,740
Rym: So they did something similar with flash in that recent live journal exploit.

768
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:23,700
Rym: Yeah You know basically the flash that got called Would use the cross-site scripting to access some other application and edit the last thing you had posted to live journal.

769
00:47:23,961 --> 00:47:26,429
Scott: Basically people are getting hit by this at this kind of attack.

770
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:28,858
Scott: big-time websites are getting hit by this all over the.

771
00:47:28,878 --> 00:47:29,560
Rym: they're not easy.

772
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:35,768
Scott: I mean all you really need to do is get a. you know When you go to a website and you log in you click stay logged in So you're still logged in.

773
00:47:35,788 --> 00:47:36,915
Scott: you go to some other website.

774
00:47:36,935 --> 00:47:37,640
Scott: That is nothing to do.

775
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,512
Scott: Let's say you're still logged in to say Twitter you go to some other website.

776
00:47:40,532 --> 00:47:41,255
Scott: That's not Twitter.

777
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,440
Scott: It's I don't know Google, right?

778
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:48,419
Scott: They could make something where you click on it and then it goes over to Twitter and does stuff with your logged in this.

779
00:47:48,921 --> 00:47:51,393
Scott: Because Twitter is all not with the good security.

780
00:47:51,433 --> 00:47:52,076
Rym: They're not.

781
00:47:52,197 --> 00:47:52,860
Rym: they really are.

782
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:59,260
Scott: You know, this is one of those situations where it's easy to say Yeah, those people you got a pro crew comm you click on something and suddenly you're sending out a tweet.

783
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,107
Scott: You don't even realize.

784
00:48:00,612 --> 00:48:06,620
Rym: but we you know We had multiple Forums and things on our web server in the past and there are even issues with us.

785
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,469
Rym: Just no one noticed him because we got rid of all that shit.

786
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:08,871
Rym: Yep.

787
00:48:09,294 --> 00:48:13,227
Scott: But anyway the What happened here on reddit is somebody.

788
00:48:13,649 --> 00:48:21,359
Scott: they found something found one JavaScript that basically says when you hover over a link do something and then they combine that with the.

789
00:48:22,206 --> 00:48:23,900
Scott: You know make someone post a comment.

790
00:48:24,021 --> 00:48:25,347
Scott: So basically you would go to reddit.

791
00:48:25,608 --> 00:48:29,467
Scott: you would hover over a link and it would post a comment But it wouldn't just post a comment.

792
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:32,220
Scott: It would post a reply to every single comment on the whole page.

793
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:32,942
Rym: So think about it.

794
00:48:33,183 --> 00:48:35,410
Rym: like three people visit a page exponential.

795
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:40,092
Scott: three people visit the page and suddenly you've got like three six now.

796
00:48:40,132 --> 00:48:45,770
Rym: now Here, here's my joke on Reddit, how would anyone even notice?

797
00:48:46,152 --> 00:48:47,900
Rym: I know right fuck read it seriously.

798
00:48:48,741 --> 00:48:50,087
Scott: Basically, you know what happens right?

799
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:53,339
Scott: the comment that they're posting is the evil link itself.

800
00:48:54,103 --> 00:48:57,580
Scott: So it's a beautiful page in this awesome way.

801
00:48:58,681 --> 00:49:00,349
Rym: It's so beautiful.

802
00:49:00,369 --> 00:49:02,780
Rym: Like I can't describe you how happy I am that this happened.

803
00:49:03,862 --> 00:49:06,980
Scott: If you're making websites watch out for the cross-eyed scripting attacks.

804
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,328
Scott: You're not embarrassed like all these big-name websites.

805
00:49:09,469 --> 00:49:12,540
Rym: how lucky we are to live in this time the first moment in human history.

806
00:49:13,281 --> 00:49:14,043
Scott: Yeah, right.

807
00:49:14,725 --> 00:49:19,417
Scott: and if you are thinking of doing an attack cross-eyed scripting is real easy to do.

808
00:49:19,557 --> 00:49:20,520
Scott: just learn some JavaScript.

809
00:49:20,922 --> 00:49:21,486
Scott: It's a joke.

810
00:49:21,687 --> 00:49:26,970
Rym: You can nail big-time websites real easy like yep and it's only it's going to get worse before it gets better.

811
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:32,028
Rym: and really I'm more and more of the mind that the only way to Get things like this fixed is to exploit them a hundred percent.

812
00:49:32,289 --> 00:49:34,937
Rym: Yep, because if things aren't exploited people just don't care.

813
00:49:34,957 --> 00:49:41,000
Scott: Mm-hmm Alright, this is uh, this is semi gaming news, but I'm approaching this from the tech angle.

814
00:49:41,203 --> 00:49:42,159
Rym: Yeah, we can wind this down.

815
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,826
Scott: Sony's coming out with this PSP.

816
00:49:44,866 --> 00:49:46,572
Scott: go you might have seen it around.

817
00:49:46,633 --> 00:49:47,576
Scott: It's still not out yet.

818
00:49:47,957 --> 00:49:48,479
Rym: Go go go.

819
00:49:48,681 --> 00:49:51,406
Scott: It's coming out real soon And the thing is right.

820
00:49:51,948 --> 00:50:01,220
Scott: there's been a lot of talk because it seems like you know I think I read the like EB and what Australia isn't gonna sell it and some other places just aren't gonna sell it.

821
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,720
Scott: It's not really gonna be a problem in the US but it's me a problem in other places.

822
00:50:04,821 --> 00:50:06,960
Scott: We're like stores just don't want to sell this thing.

823
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:09,432
Scott: And the reason is there's no games for it.

824
00:50:09,492 --> 00:50:10,940
Scott: all the games are download games.

825
00:50:11,901 --> 00:50:16,915
Scott: So if you're a store you make all your money selling games at big margins and you sell the consoles.

826
00:50:16,955 --> 00:50:18,480
Scott: that like no margin, right?

827
00:50:19,321 --> 00:50:22,199
Scott: so why would you sell PSP goes at no margin.

828
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:27,659
Scott: if You're gonna not sell any PSP go games because there are no PSP.

829
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:28,686
Rym: go You know who's gonna sell.

830
00:50:28,706 --> 00:50:29,814
Rym: you can sell it.

831
00:50:29,975 --> 00:50:30,640
Scott: our accessories.

832
00:50:30,981 --> 00:50:35,680
Rym: The fine thing is this is one more nail in the coffin of game stores for video games.

833
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,815
Scott: Well, I think it's a nail in the coffin of stores period.

834
00:50:37,875 --> 00:50:50,180
Rym: but the other thing Here's the thing like a Walmart or a grocery store are the places where these things in things like this going forward in the future Will be sold because some stores will have to exist because you can't easily buy that stuff over the internet.

835
00:50:50,601 --> 00:50:52,989
Rym: Yeah, mostly just food stores and clothing.

836
00:50:53,009 --> 00:50:53,591
Rym: Yep.

837
00:50:53,772 --> 00:50:56,260
Rym: And even then I buy most of my clothing over the internet.

838
00:50:56,461 --> 00:50:58,730
Rym: Yep, I even buy some of my food over the internet.

839
00:50:58,951 --> 00:50:59,533
Scott: Now his is.

840
00:50:59,573 --> 00:51:06,273
Scott: the other thing right is that Sony actually I found out they foresaw this problem.

841
00:51:06,293 --> 00:51:07,980
Scott: They're not that stupid, right?

842
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:08,643
Scott: They knew that.

843
00:51:08,683 --> 00:51:11,196
Scott: why would anyone sell this thing on such a you know, a low margin?

844
00:51:11,216 --> 00:51:11,900
Scott: if there's no games?

845
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:17,139
Scott: The margin on it is actually jacked up pretty high and the retail some retailers are happy about it.

846
00:51:18,382 --> 00:51:24,820
Scott: So the thing is why would you the consumer buy this thing with a jacked up margin?

847
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:25,943
Rym: Here's the answer here.

848
00:51:25,963 --> 00:51:30,239
Scott: The answer is buy an old PSP that someone's training in for a PSP.

849
00:51:30,279 --> 00:51:32,825
Scott: go That'll be mad cheap.

850
00:51:33,106 --> 00:51:40,880
Rym: They're doing this just to get the retailers to carry him in the beginning and Everyone who knows better all this weight and buy one like next year when they have a massive price cut.

851
00:51:41,088 --> 00:51:52,145
Scott: also if there's a built-in margin like that then places like Amazon are probably gonna be able to sell the thing for a big reduced cost because they're willing to suffer a much smaller margin being An internet store not a GameStop.

852
00:51:52,165 --> 00:51:55,194
Rym: I mean like GameStops are basically glorified pawn shops at this point.

853
00:51:55,255 --> 00:52:08,779
Scott: Anyway, yep, and in the end the People I would love to see some statistics about how many games that are sold back to GameStops were originally stolen from other GameStops.

854
00:52:10,781 --> 00:52:14,900
Rym: All right, I got one more here and this wrap this up, yeah, there were a bunch of articles recently.

855
00:52:14,981 --> 00:52:16,272
Rym: This is starting to happen more and more.

856
00:52:16,332 --> 00:52:17,179
Rym: We're like a bank.

857
00:52:17,642 --> 00:52:23,911
Rym: We'll just you know accidentally email their customer database to like this is a big one And this it's not like.

858
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,300
Rym: this is an isolated thing.

859
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:33,450
Rym: This is happening a lot and ISP emailed like their entire customer list to like half the people who got bills from them recently.

860
00:52:33,952 --> 00:52:35,255
Rym: and the biggest one and this is the.

861
00:52:35,396 --> 00:52:39,708
Rym: this is the one I'll focus on a Bank the Rocky Mountain Bank in Wyoming.

862
00:52:39,989 --> 00:52:43,340
Scott: Why is the Rocky Mountain Bank in Wyoming and not Colorado accidentally sent?

863
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,580
Scott: They know the Rocky Mountains extend to collar and to extend into Wyoming.

864
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:53,238
Rym: But the point is this ill stands this gigantic confidential financial document to some dudes.

865
00:52:53,278 --> 00:52:56,567
Rym: Gmail account Now one in the real world.

866
00:52:56,929 --> 00:53:02,091
Rym: if someone mails you something in the physical mail accidentally They're fucked and by law you come shit.

867
00:53:02,151 --> 00:53:04,363
Rym: law at the tough shit law It's not.

868
00:53:04,424 --> 00:53:07,899
Scott: and but here if you mail me your social security card, that's mine now.

869
00:53:09,082 --> 00:53:11,642
Rym: Well, it never belonged to the person who mailed it to you I know.

870
00:53:11,723 --> 00:53:14,416
Scott: but I mean if you mail me a hundred dollars, you can't ask for it back.

871
00:53:14,618 --> 00:53:15,100
Rym: It's mine.

872
00:53:15,361 --> 00:53:16,707
Rym: Yeah, it's this whole protection thing.

873
00:53:16,727 --> 00:53:19,820
Rym: So you can't like mail someone something and then mail them a bill later, right?

874
00:53:20,381 --> 00:53:29,204
Rym: But basically, you know this company this bank mailed some dude this confidential information and then they'd realized they made a mistake and They went to Google.

875
00:53:29,224 --> 00:53:31,720
Rym: and Google said you know what fuck you come back with a warrant.

876
00:53:31,907 --> 00:53:32,280
Rym: That's right.

877
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,860
Scott: Google basically won't give you shit unless you have a subpoena or something.

878
00:53:35,121 --> 00:53:50,323
Rym: So they found some stupid judge who agreed with them got a warrant and basically Google was forced by law to cut this dude this guy who hadn't did nothing wrong off from his email account with no knowledge No consent no Notification nothing.

879
00:53:50,343 --> 00:53:51,147
Rym: they just locked him out.

880
00:53:51,548 --> 00:53:52,934
Scott: now think about that for a second.

881
00:53:53,034 --> 00:53:55,517
Scott: You're right, you know when it's email You're just sort of like, huh?

882
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,579
Scott: Let's say they sent the guy the stuff in the real mail.

883
00:53:58,801 --> 00:54:01,190
Scott: That's the equivalent of the judge saying, huh?

884
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:03,499
Scott: They sent you a confidential document in the mail, huh?

885
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:08,000
Scott: We're just gonna have to cease the mailman's not gonna visit your house ever again.

886
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:16,980
Rym: In fact, we're gonna have to come and take all the mail we find in your house in case It's one of those documents and we're gonna destroy your mailbox with a sledgehammer just in case just in case.

887
00:54:17,302 --> 00:54:19,780
Scott: That's basically what they did here and I'm just gonna sum this up.

888
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:29,999
Rym: We our governments need to realize that Email and digit and digital stuff like this has to be treated with the same respect that physical stuff.

889
00:54:30,019 --> 00:54:30,822
Scott: does I mean?

890
00:54:30,842 --> 00:54:34,640
Scott: the same problem is happening about these three strikes laws that they're getting thrown around in Europe.

891
00:54:34,761 --> 00:54:38,660
Scott: Right, if you're accused of copyright infringement three times will turn off your internets.

892
00:54:39,082 --> 00:54:45,630
Scott: Oh, really the same internets that my kids need to do homework and the same internets I need to apply for a job and the same internets that I need.

893
00:54:46,031 --> 00:54:49,324
Scott: the Internet's does a lot more than one Thing.

894
00:54:49,484 --> 00:54:50,791
Scott: email does a lot of things.

895
00:54:50,831 --> 00:54:52,460
Scott: These are necessary services.

896
00:54:52,560 --> 00:55:01,740
Scott: You can't cut off someone's entire telephone entire internet entire mail entire whatever just because there's one Thing wrong with it somewhere.

897
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:09,569
Rym: Well, we were talking about this actually you mean Emily the other night and I realized that if I lost access to my email For more than a day or so.

898
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:20,055
Rym: I am basically I'm unable to do a vast but like a large majority of the things that are necessary to my life Like my and not not my physical life.

899
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:24,014
Scott: I mean we're An email a lot less lately, but even so I do need it.

900
00:55:24,034 --> 00:55:24,476
Rym: Well, that's cuz.

901
00:55:24,516 --> 00:55:37,380
Rym: I'm the producer here I mean, I'm the one who responds like the 20 GeekNights emails every day and arranges everything but also my regular life and You know I can eat and there I can make all the like physical necessities of my life without all this technology.

902
00:55:38,062 --> 00:55:48,457
Rym: But because I have all those things already people like us technological people we live I Guess socially on this like other plane of existence like Wil Wheaton says it best.

903
00:55:48,517 --> 00:55:48,698
Rym: Hi.

904
00:55:48,738 --> 00:55:50,319
Rym: I'm Wil Wheaton I come from the internet.

905
00:55:51,062 --> 00:56:07,512
Rym: I have this life on the internet that cannot exist without all of these technological things and Taking them away basically cuts me off from this higher functioning plane of existence in which I exist for the majority of my time And forces me to live this other lower life,

906
00:56:08,154 --> 00:56:08,355
Scott: yep,

907
00:56:08,716 --> 00:56:10,902
Rym: and it is Internet.

908
00:56:11,002 --> 00:56:16,440
Rym: access should be a utility email should be protected the way real mail is and should be like electricity.

909
00:56:17,103 --> 00:56:18,953
Scott: You know, you just get it and that's it.

910
00:56:18,993 --> 00:56:20,300
Scott: You got you got an IP address.

911
00:56:20,361 --> 00:56:27,839
Scott: You should get a static IP address, by the way And you should just get an amount of bandwidth and then if you use more you pay more to be metered.

912
00:56:28,281 --> 00:56:31,217
Scott: Fair metering though not BS metering like the cable companies want.

913
00:56:31,237 --> 00:56:39,400
Scott: my mom Should pay five bucks a month because she all she does is barely anything and I should pay maybe a hundred because I'm doing a Ton of shit like uploading GeekNights episodes.

914
00:56:39,681 --> 00:56:46,579
Scott: It really just comes down to their metering and as technology improves when we get fiber optic cables and whatnot The price got to go down to keep it fair.

915
00:56:47,143 --> 00:56:54,219
Rym: It really just comes down to the fact that you know It's a buzzword and a lot of people don't understand what it means and this is not the show to talk about that.

916
00:56:54,985 --> 00:57:03,100
Rym: net neutrality is Seriously one of the most important issues facing government in the industrialized world today.

917
00:57:03,321 --> 00:57:05,860
Scott: Yeah, but it's very difficult because we want net neutrality.

918
00:57:06,021 --> 00:57:16,125
Scott: But if we want the government to mandate net neutrality Then we're also giving the government the power to regulate and we don't want to give the government the power to regulate because they suck Ass at it.

919
00:57:16,185 --> 00:57:25,157
Rym: Well beyond that it's difficult to convince Politicians that net neutrality is important when the majority of their constituents are the old men who don't realize 15 years old.

920
00:57:26,182 --> 00:57:41,874
Rym: I'll make a more lucid point that That basically teen years These the majority of their constituents have no conception That it's even a problem and it would not affect them in the near future.

921
00:57:42,195 --> 00:57:44,303
Rym: It's such a long-term Problem.

922
00:57:44,343 --> 00:57:46,373
Rym: We can't even explain to these people what it is.

923
00:57:46,433 --> 00:57:48,903
Scott: I think that's why a lot of people are saying It's like a red herring.

924
00:57:48,943 --> 00:57:51,712
Scott: It's a red herring because you know, it's it's not.

925
00:57:51,812 --> 00:57:55,439
Scott: it's not currently an issue immediately It's a long-term thing.

926
00:57:55,582 --> 00:58:00,020
Rym: But in the long run I think it's going to have more far-reaching implications for our society as a whole.

927
00:58:00,441 --> 00:58:14,630
Rym: Then even like the national health care debate right now has definitely which is scary to think about but I'm dead serious I think that health care reform right now will not be as meaningful to society in the long run as net neutrality will be.

928
00:58:14,651 --> 00:58:19,970
Rym: yeah, I know people think because net neutrality is such a Simpler problem to solve Jesus.

929
00:58:20,332 --> 00:58:25,720
Scott: and you know people think they're like, you know, okay Let's say we came up with some theoretical perfect health care system, right?

930
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,980
Scott: How significant a change is it really gonna make in a short period of time?

931
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:34,100
Scott: Basically, when you go to the doctor's office, you'll fill out different pieces of paper.

932
00:58:34,361 --> 00:58:37,818
Rym: That's the kind of look at how much the world has changed in 15 years.

933
00:58:39,463 --> 00:58:40,393
Rym: Yep, I mean it.

934
00:58:40,434 --> 00:59:02,080
Rym: this is you know maybe I'm just inspired because I just watched this Carl Sagan thing a million times and I have this urge to read cosmos again, but The Internet has changed our society in ways that I think few people I don't think we mean Scott or even you know Some of the people at the top of technology Really understand the implications and ramifications of the Internet.

935
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:03,626
Rym: Everyone's trying real hard.

936
00:59:04,108 --> 00:59:07,340
Scott: at least some people know that we have to try real hard to understand them.

937
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:13,563
Rym: But I think our society like society is being changed faster than even the people at the cutting edge Understand.

938
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:16,454
Scott: most people the vast majority of it's like this.

939
00:59:16,514 --> 00:59:21,050
Scott: society is like not even Like it's like, you know society is made of people.

940
00:59:21,511 --> 00:59:30,225
Scott: but it's strange in that somehow this sort of object like Non-human object that is society somehow All right That is people.

941
00:59:30,265 --> 00:59:30,587
Scott: but is?

942
00:59:30,648 --> 00:59:32,640
Scott: it is made of people but is not in and of itself.

943
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:35,651
Scott: It's getting ahead of all the people.

944
00:59:35,812 --> 00:59:43,620
Rym: it's like it's the it's the intelligence paradox Or if you make it if you could ever possibly make an AI that can become smarter faster than you become smarter.

945
00:59:44,082 --> 00:59:49,158
Rym: Eventually the AI will not need you because it can make a eyes faster than itself.

946
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:56,058
Rym: Mmm, and there's this exponential explosion of intelligence and the internet is almost doing that to our society.

947
00:59:56,078 --> 00:59:58,445
Rym: I mean In Wednesday's show.

948
00:59:58,486 --> 00:59:59,894
Rym: I think we talked about ghosts in the shell.

949
00:59:59,914 --> 01:00:09,013
Rym: I remember talking about how Ghost in the shell that universe those ideas are more true to reality than a lot of people would be comfortable to admit.

950
01:00:09,474 --> 01:00:13,539
Rym: and it's easy to say it isn't because you look and It's all this like cyborgs and physical world stuff.

951
01:00:14,121 --> 01:00:21,440
Rym: But if you look at the society of ghosts in the shell, especially I think our society's cyberspace metaphor I think so much the cyber brain metaphor.

952
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:26,637
Rym: I think our society right now is close to surpassing what happened in ghosts in the shell.

953
01:00:26,677 --> 01:00:29,567
Rym: on a societal level Maybe close ways.

954
01:00:29,607 --> 01:00:31,634
Rym: think about how fast things change in the last five years.

955
01:00:32,056 --> 01:00:33,260
Rym: go five years into the future.

956
01:00:33,681 --> 01:00:39,337
Rym: Yeah, I I can't predict more than six or seven months out on tech, but it can't wait.

957
01:00:39,818 --> 01:00:40,380
Rym: I can predict.

958
01:00:40,962 --> 01:00:57,820
Rym: I've reasonably predicted, you know, five to ten years of politics at a time in broad strokes and I can reasonably think I see where Politics and where society and where health care and where all these physical things are going because they're evolving so much more slowly And yet I can't predict where the Internet's going months into the future.

959
01:00:58,402 --> 01:01:01,876
Rym: No, and the internet is probably gonna have more ramifications in the long run.

960
01:01:02,418 --> 01:01:06,557
Rym: Yep I think we should end on that because I kind of want to go to bed and I'm hungry.

961
01:01:06,939 --> 01:01:13,631
Rym: Yep I'm not very good at singing songs.

962
01:01:13,792 --> 01:01:15,519
Rym: But here's here's a try.

963
01:01:28,312 --> 01:01:38,441
Rym: If you wish to make you must first Invent the universe.

964
01:01:39,025 --> 01:01:42,485
Rym: space With a network of.

965
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:46,449
Scott: You might emerge somewhere else in space.

966
01:01:47,531 --> 01:01:49,136
Rym: Some win else in time.

967
01:01:49,177 --> 01:01:51,324
Scott: the sky calls to us.

968
01:01:51,946 --> 01:01:53,190
Scott: We do not destroy ourselves.

969
01:01:54,376 --> 01:01:59,076
Scott: We will one day Enter to the stars.

970
01:01:59,578 --> 01:02:07,770
Rym: the storm or glorious dawn awaits not a sunrise But a galaxy rise a warning filled for a hundred billion suns.

971
01:02:08,852 --> 01:02:10,138
Rym: Why is it of the Milky Way?

972
01:02:10,198 --> 01:02:18,349
Rym: cosmos is full beyond measure Elegant truths of explicit interrelationships of the possum.

973
01:02:20,253 --> 01:02:29,729
Rym: I believe our future depends powerfully on how well we understand this cosmos In which we float like a mode of dust in the morning sky.

974
01:02:30,171 --> 01:02:34,506
Rym: But the brain does much more than just recollect.

975
01:02:34,526 --> 01:02:36,488
Rym: it intercompares See the size.

976
01:02:38,403 --> 01:02:39,488
Rym: It generates abstractions.

977
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:45,909
Rym: The simplest thought like the concept of the number one is an elaborate logical underpinning.

978
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:50,689
Rym: Brain has its own language for testing the structure and consistency of the world.

979
01:02:51,373 --> 01:02:59,360
Rym: Still more glorious dawn awaits The galaxy was a morning film for hundred billion songs.

980
01:03:00,212 --> 01:03:01,748
Rym: the right of the Milky Way.

981
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:16,476
Rym: the sky Calls to us if we do not destroy ourselves We will one day Ventured to the stars.

982
01:03:27,302 --> 01:03:32,155
Rym: For thousands of years people have wondered about the universe.

983
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:33,960
Scott: did it stretch out forever?

984
01:03:34,703 --> 01:03:36,358
Rym: Or was there a limit?

985
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:44,338
Rym: the big bangs of black holes Dark matter to a possible big crunch of image of the universe.

986
01:03:44,358 --> 01:03:47,780
Rym: today It's full of strange sounding ideas.

987
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:57,374
Rym: How lucky we are to live in this time the first moment in human history when we are in fact visiting other worlds.

988
01:03:57,394 --> 01:04:05,443
Rym: a Still more glorious dawn awaits not a sunrise but a galaxy rise a morning filled with 400 billion suns.

989
01:04:07,401 --> 01:04:08,718
Scott: The rise of the Milky Way.

990
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:16,954
Scott: Glorious dawn awaits not a sunrise but a galaxy rise a morning filled with 400 billion suns.

991
01:04:17,802 --> 01:04:19,235
Rym: the rise of the Milky Way.

992
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:28,300
Rym: The surface of the earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean.

993
01:04:29,521 --> 01:04:33,679
Rym: Recently we've waned a little way up and the water seems inviting.

994
01:04:47,452 --> 01:04:50,042
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
