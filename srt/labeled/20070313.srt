1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,227
Rym: It's Tuesday March 13th.

2
00:00:11,628 --> 00:00:12,109
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,820
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight still without internet.

4
00:00:15,941 --> 00:00:18,479
Rym: We talk a little bit about saving your game.

5
00:00:20,582 --> 00:00:26,601
Scott: Let's do this Mmm.

6
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:28,847
Scott: Gummy bear.

7
00:00:29,108 --> 00:00:30,993
Rym: yeah, gummy bears luckily.

8
00:00:31,013 --> 00:00:39,440
Rym: I took the bag away from Scott, so you won't hear Crackle Crackle Crackle throughout the show tonight unless I get up and get him from the other side of the room.

9
00:00:39,763 --> 00:00:46,040
Rym: I'm factoring in your laziness Damn you plus the fact that we're not taking a break because we still don't have the internet.

10
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:48,089
Rym: So we're not really gonna bother with things of the day.

11
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:54,773
Rym: You know what we'll still do things of the day But it'll be the best thing we saw in the last 24 hours.

12
00:00:55,274 --> 00:00:59,145
Rym: Oh crap internet or no We got time.

13
00:00:59,185 --> 00:00:59,648
Rym: we got time.

14
00:00:59,668 --> 00:01:02,780
Rym: all right you can think of something I'm thinking.

15
00:01:03,582 --> 00:01:15,920
Rym: But before we get to that in the news since we can only talk about News that did not come to us from any sort of electronic medium since we don't have access to any non-electronic mediums I'm not gonna go get a newspaper.

16
00:01:17,002 --> 00:01:19,620
Scott: There's no way I'm ever gonna pay for a newspaper.

17
00:01:20,864 --> 00:01:24,153
Scott: While Google News exists a newspaper will not Scott by.

18
00:01:24,273 --> 00:01:26,399
Rym: I could have gotten the free newspaper in New York City.

19
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:27,323
Scott: I don't.

20
00:01:27,503 --> 00:01:29,671
Scott: I didn't see any people giving out free newspaper.

21
00:01:29,752 --> 00:01:31,880
Scott: Oh you mean like the AM, New York or the Metro?

22
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:32,980
Scott: Yeah, okay?

23
00:01:33,221 --> 00:01:36,170
Scott: Sometimes they do give away like the poster the times for free.

24
00:01:36,491 --> 00:01:43,319
Scott: when when some advertiser puts in like a big Advertising section and that pays for the papers and no one needs to pay for.

25
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:48,200
Rym: well There's one pizza place I eat at often and they always have the New York Post just sitting there.

26
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,131
Rym: So I often read it if I'm not reading a novel.

27
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:51,620
Scott: It's basically a tabloid.

28
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:52,584
Rym: Yeah, it is.

29
00:01:53,126 --> 00:01:57,060
Rym: I usually read the comics to remind myself how bad newspaper comics are.

30
00:01:58,302 --> 00:02:03,680
Rym: So along those lines since this is the only thing I could observe about today that was it all interesting.

31
00:02:04,242 --> 00:02:05,525
Rym: That was the shortest winter ever.

32
00:02:05,545 --> 00:02:06,990
Rym: I don't know.

33
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:17,520
Rym: it was warm as in shorts and a t-shirt until Early mid-february, and it's now early mid-march and it's shorts and t-shirt weather again.

34
00:02:18,082 --> 00:02:21,060
Scott: It wasn't shorts and t-shirt was mid-february.

35
00:02:22,624 --> 00:02:34,267
Rym: On February 9th was the last day I went running in shorts and a t-shirt at night And you hadn't been going in shorts and a t-shirt since like you know August I had been.

36
00:02:34,307 --> 00:02:37,898
Rym: the only time I didn't is when I had to go to work And they won't let me wear that stuff there.

37
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:44,300
Scott: Well, you know it was cold and gray just wasn't wintery snowy stormy until like January and February.

38
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:47,166
Rym: Well, we had a cold snap or two But otherwise it was mostly what remember.

39
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:51,625
Rym: the day after New Year's all of us went on a long Shorts and t-shirt hike.

40
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:53,411
Scott: yeah, it was still warm.

41
00:02:53,452 --> 00:02:55,740
Rym: then yeah, and now it's warm again.

42
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,430
Rym: I just went out running in shorts and a t-shirt.

43
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,220
Rym: It's gonna be almost 70 degrees tomorrow.

44
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,404
Rym: We got a rainstorm coming.

45
00:03:00,444 --> 00:03:01,326
Rym: Maybe a thunderstorm.

46
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:03,754
Scott: I guess regardless of the actual weather it.

47
00:03:04,596 --> 00:03:08,920
Scott: You know they think the winter Doldrums did last the usual amount of time.

48
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,439
Rym: Yeah, maybe just where you go or where you were going then because in Yonkers it was sunny almost every day.

49
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:21,505
Scott: Well now the feeling of winter is over has definitely overcome my Yes senses.

50
00:03:21,686 --> 00:03:27,031
Rym: well the big difference today as opposed to any other day was today when I went outside to run It didn't smell like winter anymore.

51
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:28,339
Rym: I could smell things.

52
00:03:28,881 --> 00:03:31,650
Scott: Yeah, I was able to open my sunroof, which I forgot.

53
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,696
Scott: I even had yep moonroof.

54
00:03:33,736 --> 00:03:41,878
Rym: I guess technically and Also, I opened the windows and I was like ah Yep, I left my windows to my room open all day and my room smells nice.

55
00:03:43,444 --> 00:03:44,230
Scott: Windows to my room.

56
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:51,802
Rym: turning the fan on Won't be long till we'll put the air conditioners in and then Al Gore's global warming will make it too hot and the power grid will Go out.

57
00:03:51,822 --> 00:03:54,100
Rym: there'll be mass chaos New York will flood will all die.

58
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,354
Scott: But or we'll just stay cool in our rooms with our computers and our air conditioning.

59
00:03:58,414 --> 00:04:00,060
Scott: that will hopefully have internet access.

60
00:04:00,301 --> 00:04:12,863
Rym: It's also I realized now because I'm looking at computers that I had said I'm gonna get a computer By summer of this year and summers coming up, so I thought it was in Summer.

61
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:15,213
Scott: you were gonna get one not by summer.

62
00:04:15,253 --> 00:04:16,700
Scott: Are you are you pushing it up?

63
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:21,978
Scott: Oh my god Rym the Luddite is gonna buy a computer sooner than he thought he was.

64
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:22,642
Rym: well Here's the thing.

65
00:04:22,742 --> 00:04:30,908
Rym: originally my plan was I'm going to have a computer that would be delivered to my house One week before Team Fortress 2 was released.

66
00:04:30,928 --> 00:04:34,600
Rym: That was my original plan and Team Fortress 2 got pushed back a couple times.

67
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:36,106
Scott: It's pushed back quite a bit.

68
00:04:36,407 --> 00:04:44,820
Rym: Yeah, and I know when I made that original plan I expected to be making a new computer in like May give or take.

69
00:04:46,382 --> 00:04:58,352
Rym: And now now if Team Fortress 2 is gonna come out and you know late fall I don't know if I want to wait that long partly because once it gets warm This computer made it through the winter mostly due to the fact that it's not hot.

70
00:04:58,854 --> 00:04:59,415
Scott: That's right.

71
00:04:59,596 --> 00:05:05,890
Scott: in the summer rims computer It has been known to overheat quite a bit.

72
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:15,660
Rym: well the thing is way back in the day I overclock this bastard A lot so as a result I had the hardware temperature alarm to warn me if I was pushing it a little too hard.

73
00:05:16,144 --> 00:05:25,180
Rym: So and the thing is once it goes off You cannot stop it without rebooting the computer Which would force me to reboot it because otherwise I wouldn't and in fact there were many times.

74
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:33,888
Rym: I'd be playing counter-strike in colony with the super overclock motherboard going and it would start overheating and I'd keep playing counter-strike despite the noise.

75
00:05:33,989 --> 00:05:37,560
Rym: because the game was more important than this you should have unplugged the VZ speaker.

76
00:05:38,363 --> 00:05:43,600
Rym: I thought about that, but I didn't have enough time because there I only had six seconds between rounds, and I wasn't dying.

77
00:05:44,102 --> 00:05:46,350
Scott: Well like before you start a game of counter-strike unplug it.

78
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:54,930
Rym: then when you're done playing plug it back in now cuz if I put That much forethought into circumventing my own protection mechanisms It's Chernobyl man.

79
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:55,617
Scott: That's what that is.

80
00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:58,957
Rym: But the worst thing is as the computers gotten older.

81
00:05:58,977 --> 00:06:04,880
Rym: it Started going off more and more because the fans are all frail And I'm not gonna buy new fans for this busted old computer.

82
00:06:05,502 --> 00:06:06,345
Scott: That would be silly.

83
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:22,756
Rym: and also the video card was getting older and older and started overheating more and more and Eventually got to the point where I'd be asleep in the middle of the night in the summer, and it'd be like 75 degrees out And I hear Scott laughing in the other room as I wake up.

84
00:06:22,836 --> 00:06:33,862
Scott: fuck god That's what you get for being a Luddite and you know being so averse to spending even a dollar on technology like Problem.

85
00:06:33,882 --> 00:06:43,339
Scott: you'll spend all kinds of money on other crap you don't need but if it's a computer or something you will hold out until The last possible minute, it's not just a computer my car.

86
00:06:43,741 --> 00:06:51,067
Scott: You'll hold out past the last possible minute like the time has passed where you should have bought one And that was two years ago, and you still didn't buy.

87
00:06:51,127 --> 00:06:51,629
Rym: think of this.

88
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:52,773
Rym: think of this.

89
00:06:53,195 --> 00:06:58,652
Scott: this computer lasted me How long and I would argue that it hasn't actually lasted.

90
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:00,298
Rym: It's doing the show just fine.

91
00:07:00,518 --> 00:07:03,883
Scott: Yeah, okay It's more like a zombie It's not.

92
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:06,009
Scott: it was dead and now it's sort of anything.

93
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:09,760
Rym: my computer can still play counter-strike with maximum FPS?

94
00:07:10,121 --> 00:07:10,944
Scott: I don't think so.

95
00:07:11,045 --> 00:07:12,289
Scott: It's got a TNT - in it.

96
00:07:12,992 --> 00:07:14,317
Rym: Oh yeah the TNT - that's right.

97
00:07:14,337 --> 00:07:15,080
Rym: the video card died.

98
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:20,898
Rym: Yeah, that's right, but I could buy a $15 AGP card, and then it would be back to playing counter-strike at 100 FPS.

99
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,128
Scott: Yeah, that's all you.

100
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:33,645
Rym: but you see with that doo doo doo problem I solved that because it started getting bad now that I moved to this new house And I don't leave the AC on when I'm not home I just open the windows.

101
00:07:34,047 --> 00:07:38,151
Rym: so I turn like I said the AC so it'll turn on in my room Maybe an hour before I get home from work.

102
00:07:38,393 --> 00:07:43,420
Rym: You know just to save electricity There's no reason to cool a room when I'm not in here, and I'd always come home to the computer going.

103
00:07:46,781 --> 00:07:53,605
Rym: So I went to the BIOS and I just told it to go off like four or five degrees centigrade higher And it stopped going off.

104
00:07:54,268 --> 00:07:57,740
Rym: good job kind of like when the case fan started making all this noise.

105
00:07:57,801 --> 00:07:58,995
Rym: I fixed that by unplugging it.

106
00:08:00,421 --> 00:08:06,670
Rym: Good job, or when the CPU for the video card fan started making all that noise I just pulled it off of the video is enough about rims.

107
00:08:06,731 --> 00:08:08,177
Rym: dead computer not dead yet.

108
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:08,779
Rym: It's doing the show.

109
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,770
Rym: Yeah, it's working.

110
00:08:10,831 --> 00:08:14,072
Rym: You keep telling yourself that people are listening to the show.

111
00:08:14,092 --> 00:08:17,625
Scott: so What were you doing the show on?

112
00:08:17,886 --> 00:08:18,307
Scott: I don't know.

113
00:08:18,388 --> 00:08:19,170
Rym: don't you have some news?

114
00:08:19,752 --> 00:08:20,956
Scott: no there's no internet.

115
00:08:21,297 --> 00:08:30,358
Scott: um all right well I heard from someone that That Some guy at the game developers conference said the Wii sucked and then he apologized.

116
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,547
Rym: Scott I read that before we lost our internet.

117
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,274
Rym: I didn't or at least I read it.

118
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:35,720
Rym: Maybe I read it Friday morning?

119
00:08:35,941 --> 00:08:36,203
Rym: I don't know.

120
00:08:36,222 --> 00:08:37,208
Rym: I read it on the internet.

121
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:37,611
Scott: I don't know.

122
00:08:38,073 --> 00:08:39,039
Scott: I don't have any details.

123
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,203
Scott: I don't know the guy's name.

124
00:08:40,284 --> 00:08:42,032
Scott: I think he works for will.

125
00:08:42,131 --> 00:08:43,116
Scott: right at EA.

126
00:08:43,216 --> 00:08:44,179
Scott: on the spore game.

127
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,279
Rym: Yeah, you basically said that developing software for the Wii sucks because the Wii is weak.

128
00:08:50,622 --> 00:08:53,573
Scott: Yeah, he's right, but at the same time the Wii doesn't suck.

129
00:08:53,955 --> 00:08:55,844
Scott: no no in fact in fact He sucks.

130
00:08:56,106 --> 00:08:56,771
Scott: the end of story.

131
00:08:56,791 --> 00:09:02,240
Rym: the Wii is still Far away in my opinion the second best console out currently number one being the DS.

132
00:09:02,963 --> 00:09:03,706
Scott: Yeah, it's just cuz.

133
00:09:04,008 --> 00:09:05,293
Rym: the Wii like.

134
00:09:05,354 --> 00:09:08,739
Scott: it's got everything it needs But the games aren't there yet.

135
00:09:09,021 --> 00:09:13,800
Rym: Don't think I'm a fanboy because the Xbox 360 is right there at number three as far as I'm concerned.

136
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:18,894
Scott: Yeah, I think the difference between the Xbox 360 and the Wii is that the Wii has the higher potential.

137
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:28,300
Scott: the Xbox 360 had a great potential not as high as the Wii But the Xbox 360 has already pretty much completely fulfilled its potential.

138
00:09:28,581 --> 00:09:31,253
Rym: Well, here's the thing that the Xbox seems to do that.

139
00:09:31,273 --> 00:09:32,760
Rym: This isn't a big deal to us.

140
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:43,500
Rym: I think this is why we're not excited about the Xbox and a lot of Older PC gamers aren't excited about the Xbox but younger generations and people who didn't play a lot of FPS is back in the day.

141
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,263
Rym: They're super excited.

142
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:53,580
Rym: The Xbox is doing now for modern gamers What PC gaming with FPS is did back in the day with a lot more technological fiddling.

143
00:09:53,580 --> 00:10:03,239
Rym: I mean we had team speak and you know headsets and we talked to our friends while we were deathmatching Online with all everything that they have now in the Xbox back in the day.

144
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:09,432
Rym: So when we see a console doing this we think why would I use that when I can do the same thing slightly better?

145
00:10:09,493 --> 00:10:14,229
Scott: if not The Xbox existed.

146
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,499
Scott: those things were done on the PC.

147
00:10:15,802 --> 00:10:17,298
Scott: Well, they are still done on the PC.

148
00:10:17,861 --> 00:10:21,070
Scott: the Xbox has sort of killed PC gaming for the most part.

149
00:10:21,211 --> 00:10:31,660
Rym: my point is just that to someone who never played quake 2 with a Team speak server or counter-strike at its peak or tribes 2 when it was and probably still is the best game ever made.

150
00:10:33,802 --> 00:10:36,392
Rym: It's the best online FPS ever made in my opinion.

151
00:10:36,492 --> 00:10:38,460
Rym: maybe I can't think of much better.

152
00:10:38,942 --> 00:10:40,613
Rym: I mean half-life and single-player game.

153
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:41,076
Rym: that's different.

154
00:10:41,518 --> 00:10:47,878
Rym: Mmm Yeah, but anyway, we'll argue about that on some other nights Maybe when we have access to the internet to look at a list of every FPS ever.

155
00:10:49,822 --> 00:10:53,434
Rym: But to someone who's never did done all that because those things are really old.

156
00:10:53,514 --> 00:10:55,801
Rym: those things came out a long time ago.

157
00:10:55,822 --> 00:11:04,691
Rym: if you get an Xbox and you've never played FPS is before and someone says you can play these shooting games Online with your friends and talk to them at the same time.

158
00:11:05,153 --> 00:11:06,477
Scott: Oh god is the best thing ever.

159
00:11:06,517 --> 00:11:07,320
Scott: Yeah co-op.

160
00:11:07,702 --> 00:11:09,753
Rym: I think that's really where the Xbox seems to shine.

161
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:10,939
Rym: is all these co-op games?

162
00:11:11,281 --> 00:11:17,818
Scott: Yeah, they're definitely a lack of co-op games on the PC and on the Wii and pretty much everywhere except the Xbox 360.

163
00:11:17,818 --> 00:11:19,965
Rym: granted I once played with my friend.

164
00:11:19,985 --> 00:11:22,716
Rym: can we play doom 2 all the way through on ultra violence?

165
00:11:23,077 --> 00:11:28,580
Scott: on co-op When we get when he finally get new computers, I definitely want to try to play the serious Sam with the co-op.

166
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,475
Scott: Yeah, that's just run around and shoot stuff.

167
00:11:30,515 --> 00:11:35,050
Rym: Whoo We should play doom 2 all the way through just for nostalgia's sake.

168
00:11:35,592 --> 00:11:35,993
Scott: All right.

169
00:11:36,254 --> 00:11:36,494
Scott: Sure.

170
00:11:36,514 --> 00:11:36,936
Scott: Yeah.

171
00:11:37,477 --> 00:11:37,758
Rym: Okay.

172
00:11:37,778 --> 00:11:38,139
Rym: All right.

173
00:11:38,843 --> 00:11:49,410
Rym: Anyway without further ado Things of the day now.

174
00:11:49,611 --> 00:11:57,659
Rym: since we don't have internet access I suppose things of the day now have to be the best thing we've seen in the last 24 hours regardless of where it came from.

175
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,223
Scott: Okay.

176
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:00,589
Scott: Have you seen anything?

177
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:01,875
Rym: Well, you want to go first.

178
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:02,719
Rym: you want me to go first?

179
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:07,700
Scott: You know, I work in the city so you'd think I would see something exciting.

180
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,951
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I remember when you watch those guys take down that purse snatcher.

181
00:12:11,393 --> 00:12:15,530
Scott: Yeah, that was like years ago though That was when you were working in the city.

182
00:12:15,912 --> 00:12:26,040
Scott: Yeah last time the last time Um, I was walking to the subway on my way out of the office and a guy came up to me and he said like I Thought he was gonna ask for directions.

183
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,980
Scott: He had like an index card and like he was just like hey, what's up?

184
00:12:30,441 --> 00:12:44,517
Scott: and then he showed me the index card and he was like Just a dollar and the index card had like a whole sob story on it and I was like not even bothering to tell me your fake sob story and The sob story that seems to be working that that's it seems to be going around.

185
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:45,320
Scott: that's super common.

186
00:12:45,461 --> 00:12:47,515
Rym: Now is my truck ran out of gas.

187
00:12:47,535 --> 00:12:48,400
Scott: No, no, no It's.

188
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:50,266
Scott: it's like I have two children.

189
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:58,093
Scott: my spouse is dead or lost or ran away or something kidnapped by the Yeah, I need money to take care of my kids.

190
00:12:58,153 --> 00:12:58,897
Scott: I don't have a job.

191
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:05,652
Scott: Help me All right, and my question to these people, I don't know if anyone, you know Obviously a lot of these people are just lying.

192
00:13:05,913 --> 00:13:07,700
Scott: It was kind of weird about this particular guys.

193
00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:08,931
Scott: He didn't look like a homeless bum.

194
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:09,899
Scott: He looked like a normal guy.

195
00:13:10,522 --> 00:13:16,060
Scott: Obviously had some sort of foreign accent, but he looked like a normal guy didn't look like a dirty homeless guy.

196
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:17,780
Scott: He wasn't carrying a bunch of crap.

197
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,000
Scott: He just had a sob story on an index card and he asked for money and I was like what the hell?

198
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,918
Scott: And I just walked away.

199
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:32,880
Scott: But all these people they have this sob story about having kids right and my question is obviously they're lying.

200
00:13:33,403 --> 00:13:36,659
Scott: But if they're not lying, where are your kids?

201
00:13:37,502 --> 00:13:38,832
Scott: Why are you they not with you?

202
00:13:38,973 --> 00:13:39,919
Scott: Where did you leave them?

203
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:51,418
Scott: I should give money to someone who you know If you're really a widow with two kids and no money and your kids aren't with you right now Where did you leave them?

204
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:58,179
Scott: What you shouldn't be with someone who should give money to if you're not watching the kids that you supposedly care about so much.

205
00:13:59,244 --> 00:13:59,557
Scott: Wow

206
00:14:00,343 --> 00:14:14,604
Rym: Well, I got to say the scam that I've run into and this was funny way back Not a year ago a few months ago actually I was out by the laundromat and I was just standing around waiting and This guy walks up to me and he looks kind of scuzzy But not too scuzzy.

207
00:14:14,664 --> 00:14:21,326
Rym: and he gives me this long sob story about he was driving a pick a tow truck to pick up a car Out here and something happened.

208
00:14:21,346 --> 00:14:24,840
Rym: He couldn't find it and then his gas tank busted and he fixed it.

209
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,838
Rym: But now he's out of gas.

210
00:14:26,301 --> 00:14:31,180
Rym: Can you have a couple bucks to get enough diesel to move his truck before the police have him towed because he's on a street?

211
00:14:31,561 --> 00:14:33,187
Rym: Blah blah blah blah and I'm like man.

212
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:36,560
Rym: all I got is quarters for the laundromat to which he says quarters are fine.

213
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:37,994
Scott: Here's the thing.

214
00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:40,064
Rym: It's not That's not the story.

215
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:41,552
Rym: I let him guy whatever I blew him off.

216
00:14:41,853 --> 00:14:53,040
Rym: I did my laundry went home Not too long ago I was picking Emily up at the train station and I'm going back to my house and the Exact same dude comes up to me and tells me the exact same story.

217
00:14:53,221 --> 00:14:58,119
Rym: Obviously doesn't recognize me because I'm not dressed all D shabby like I was last time

218
00:14:58,701 --> 00:14:58,882
Scott: Mm-hmm,

219
00:14:59,304 --> 00:15:09,119
Rym: and he tells me the exact same story like word-for-word And I just stared at him dumbfounded and just said I was polite, you know, no, I can't help you and I kept going.

220
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,463
Scott: Here's the thing.

221
00:15:10,624 --> 00:15:16,571
Scott: if a hobo came up to me if a homeless guy came up to me and he said hey, man Can I have a dollar to buy some alcohol?

222
00:15:16,793 --> 00:15:18,159
Scott: I'd say here you go.

223
00:15:18,661 --> 00:15:19,887
Rym: I had a guy do that to me once.

224
00:15:20,228 --> 00:15:21,192
Scott: that guy's awesome.

225
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:22,237
Rym: I did give him some money.

226
00:15:22,478 --> 00:15:32,306
Rym: Yeah Remember when we were in Rochester one day We were all wandering around downtown Rochester late at night just randomly and we ran into that beggar and we all gave him a bunch of money.

227
00:15:32,985 --> 00:15:34,701
Scott: Well, he wasn't really a beggar He was.

228
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:39,040
Scott: it was like a guy and he we didn't know where we were going or anything and he kind of helped us out.

229
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,640
Rym: He told us where stuff was and he helped us not be lost Yep, and then we all gave him a bunch of money because he obviously was homeless.

230
00:15:46,341 --> 00:15:46,703
Scott: I don't know.

231
00:15:46,763 --> 00:15:47,889
Scott: He might not have been homeless.

232
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:48,271
Scott: I'm ready.

233
00:15:48,311 --> 00:15:49,376
Scott: She might have just been poor.

234
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:55,820
Rym: Yeah Well, the thing is as we were leaving someone made the comments of he's just gonna buy liquor and there was a debate over now.

235
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,865
Rym: He's probably gonna buy food now.

236
00:15:56,905 --> 00:15:58,894
Rym: He's gonna buy liquor maybe blah blah blah.

237
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:08,892
Rym: about an hour later as we're walking back to get our car in a big group we see him and his other scuzzy looking friend and they've got the Biggest bottle of the cheapest liquor I've ever seen.

238
00:16:08,912 --> 00:16:09,736
Rym: he's like man.

239
00:16:09,796 --> 00:16:16,004
Scott: Thanks for the money yeah, and we talked to him for like a few minutes and He tried.

240
00:16:16,024 --> 00:16:18,072
Scott: he was he was willing to share his alcohol though.

241
00:16:18,112 --> 00:16:24,474
Rym: So yeah, and he was so drunk though There is that little bit of of civility think.

242
00:16:24,514 --> 00:16:31,460
Rym: I mean the fact that the guy Recognized us and knew that we had done him a good turn and offered us the fruits of our good turn back.

243
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:33,078
Rym: That's that's a very nice thing to do

244
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:50,751
Scott: yeah, and if you're gonna be a loser who walks around the street asking for money to get drunk and wash away your sorrows and Do that until you die someday in the distant future At least have the decency to say that's what you're doing And maybe I'll help you out if you come up to me with this lie.

245
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:53,300
Scott: I'll just be like wow you're a sad individual.

246
00:16:53,923 --> 00:16:55,209
Scott: I'm gonna not help you out that way.

247
00:16:55,269 --> 00:17:09,976
Rym: Maybe you'll die sooner an engine misery More quickly, but anyway my thing of the day this was the other night actually I was also at the train station to pick Emily up and as I'm talking to her on the phone Just cuz hey, I'm over here.

248
00:17:10,077 --> 00:17:10,983
Rym: Oh, okay I see you.

249
00:17:11,345 --> 00:17:14,040
Rym: this woman walks up to me and she starts talking to me.

250
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,570
Rym: I'm thinking first of all my bum sense goes off.

251
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:22,240
Rym: cuz whenever someone talks to me at a train station It's almost always a bum or a Jesus freak trying to convince me of something.

252
00:17:22,681 --> 00:17:24,849
Scott: I haven't run into any Jesus freaks at the train station.

253
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:37,417
Rym: when I lived in the mountains up in poque Every time I was the train station in the morning to head into the city for something crazy old women Always different crazy old women would come up rambling about Jesus and give me pamphlets.

254
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:43,138
Rym: one time I told one of them I was an atheist and she totally freaked out, but that's a story for another time.

255
00:17:43,258 --> 00:17:47,053
Scott: we should Get some pamphlets and go up to people with crazy red.

256
00:17:47,073 --> 00:17:48,520
Scott: Have you considered Cthulhu?

257
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,522
Scott: Atheism.

258
00:17:53,562 --> 00:17:58,339
Rym: but Cthulhu is 10,000 times better than that, especially if we do it with a straight face.

259
00:17:59,143 --> 00:18:02,860
Scott: Have you considered we'd have we'd be all clean-cut with the snappy shirts?

260
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,812
Scott: That's not where the alligator goes would be like a Cthulhu head with some tentacles.

261
00:18:06,892 --> 00:18:09,420
Rym: No, obviously the yellow sign that too.

262
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,130
Rym: Anyway.

263
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,864
Rym: So then I you know My bum sense goes off but I look.

264
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:20,358
Rym: and no this woman is actually well-dressed and she's obviously gonna ask me something.

265
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:30,073
Rym: and in somewhat Halting English the long story short is that she didn't speak much English, but she spoke French and Canadian French or France French I think North African French.

266
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:35,355
Rym: Ah Okay, she had an accent that I couldn't quite place at all and I've heard Canadian French.

267
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:36,600
Rym: Well Quebecois French.

268
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:44,900
Rym: I've heard French French different varieties and this was very different from all that but she spoke enough English and I know enough halting French That I was able to help her out.

269
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,139
Rym: I think basically she's fell asleep and got off at the wrong stop and had to go back.

270
00:18:49,581 --> 00:18:57,371
Rym: So I was trying to show her where the taxis were and show her how to get back on the train to go back into Where she was trying to get and all that and that was very interesting.

271
00:18:57,552 --> 00:19:00,060
Rym: I thought yeah, that's my best thing of the day.

272
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,639
Rym: That's all I can come up with without the internet.

273
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:09,220
Scott: The train that I take home goes from Grand Central to Beacon without stopping and there's a lot of places in between Grand Central and Beacon.

274
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:17,378
Scott: yeah, and People get on that train who don't belong on that train and they end up basically like they would have been home at 8 p.m.

275
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,444
Scott: Instead they're home at midnight.

276
00:19:19,744 --> 00:19:19,965
Rym: Yep.

277
00:19:20,085 --> 00:19:20,226
Rym: Cool.

278
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:25,079
Rym: The thing is almost every train coming out of New York City going north stops in Harlem 125th Street.

279
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,098
Rym: It's like the alternate station in New York City.

280
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:41,702
Rym: There's a few trains that don't stop there and if you get on that train expecting it to stop there you're so boned Super boned, but the third I think the sixth train goes there also and the four well the four goes there I know.

281
00:19:41,903 --> 00:19:45,480
Rym: yeah, pretty sure the six does too because I actually think the four or five six goes there.

282
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,624
Rym: The five doesn't go that far.

283
00:19:46,765 --> 00:19:49,978
Rym: No, no, okay only the north of there only the four goes.

284
00:19:50,018 --> 00:19:50,380
Rym: I know that.

285
00:19:50,863 --> 00:19:53,118
Rym: Aha, well along the way I actually know the five.

286
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:53,960
Rym: Michael I don't know.

287
00:19:54,141 --> 00:19:59,120
Scott: I know that the six goes all the way up into the Bronx because I'm on it and I can see where it goes.

288
00:19:59,462 --> 00:20:04,191
Rym: The four does too because that goes all by where I work like Moshaloo and Woodlawn and all those places.

289
00:20:04,714 --> 00:20:07,729
Rym: if the five goes up there It goes way off to the right where I never go.

290
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,040
Scott: I don't know enough that I gotta look at a map.

291
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:12,709
Rym: It's so rare that I take subways outside of Manhattan.

292
00:20:13,071 --> 00:20:13,392
Scott: It's true.

293
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,275
Scott: All right.

294
00:20:14,436 --> 00:20:23,219
Rym: Anyway tonight Since we don't have the internet We don't want to try to review anything since we can't pull up relevant information like who made the game what where is it?

295
00:20:24,582 --> 00:20:25,949
Scott: What system was it for?

296
00:20:26,231 --> 00:20:27,055
Rym: What's it called?

297
00:20:27,115 --> 00:20:27,939
Rym: How do I play it?

298
00:20:28,802 --> 00:20:30,340
Scott: What's this video game thing?

299
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:45,968
Rym: so I was thinking about One thing that has evolved very much throughout the years and also something that has affected me a great deal of the course of my video gaming days and that is Saving your progress, you know that.

300
00:20:46,028 --> 00:20:53,269
Scott: actually I think it's a good topic because have not having saved games It's sort of like not having internet in a way.

301
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,820
Rym: Well, it's this so such a different paradigm of gaming.

302
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:59,799
Rym: It's almost like a different era of gaming before save games.

303
00:21:00,382 --> 00:21:04,360
Scott: Well, let's start with the beginning of time when there were no saving at all.

304
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,856
Scott: It was just you played the game to play the game.

305
00:21:07,138 --> 00:21:11,402
Rym: Yeah We'll skip arcade and go right to like the early NES days like Mario 1.

306
00:21:11,402 --> 00:21:11,884
Scott: Well, I don't know.

307
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:15,619
Scott: cuz the arcade they had the high score saving which was something else.

308
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:18,478
Rym: Yeah, I don't think that's a different thing to talk about really.

309
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:18,840
Scott: I don't know.

310
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,120
Scott: I think it's it's sort of like, you know, your high score is there forever.

311
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:28,407
Scott: It's like a machine most true Yeah But it's sort of like a save game.

312
00:21:28,468 --> 00:21:34,155
Scott: in a way cuz it's like you know and you can record Your previous history or progress.

313
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:40,722
Rym: true But at the same time it's not like you can pick up where you left off and it's not like you can save you the state Of the game.

314
00:21:40,822 --> 00:21:45,960
Rym: all you're basically saving is a record that you did at that time play that game with that level of ability.

315
00:21:46,341 --> 00:21:47,225
Scott: Mmm, that's true.

316
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:51,000
Scott: But so actually there was a gauntlet game in the arcade like one of the later.

317
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,570
Scott: Oh, yeah, I remember that and you could save your game.

318
00:21:53,731 --> 00:21:54,695
Rym: It was so lame.

319
00:21:54,795 --> 00:21:58,856
Scott: and now they've got Arcade games that print out cars initial D.

320
00:21:58,956 --> 00:21:59,640
Rym: Yeah at all.

321
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,611
Scott: Yeah, there are there other ones like that too and the neo geo.

322
00:22:02,651 --> 00:22:05,140
Scott: you could cuz the neo geo is also a home system.

323
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:10,985
Scott: You could bring your neo geo memory cards plug them into the arcade and also plug them in at home and it would be the Same game.

324
00:22:11,449 --> 00:22:12,740
Rym: so then yeah their early days.

325
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,460
Rym: There were just games that you played for the sake of the high score and/or beating them and you could save your high score.

326
00:22:18,022 --> 00:22:30,749
Rym: And then there was kind of the the move especially with home systems toward games That had a beginning and an end a game that you could beat and that beating the game was the goal Usually more so than getting X number of points.

327
00:22:31,471 --> 00:22:38,135
Scott: Yeah, I mean there was adventure for the Atari But you couldn't save that game and it was meant to pretty much be played all at once.

328
00:22:38,597 --> 00:22:43,817
Rym: or Mario 1 You basically if you want to beat Mario 1 you had to sit down and play the whole thing through.

329
00:22:43,857 --> 00:22:45,765
Rym: if you make a mistake That's the end of you.

330
00:22:46,187 --> 00:22:47,472
Rym: if your mom calls you to dinner.

331
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:52,960
Rym: not beating Mario 1 tonight Didn't get enough lives in level 7 your bone in level 8.

332
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:59,483
Scott: Well actually weren't the super early PC games like some of the text adventures and stuff didn't those save Probably?

333
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,888
Scott: or like BBS games.

334
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:02,914
Scott: I assume those saved in some way.

335
00:23:02,934 --> 00:23:04,800
Rym: I'm thinking we for the most part.

336
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,619
Rym: I'd narrow it down to consoles at least for this part.

337
00:23:06,841 --> 00:23:14,383
Scott: Yeah, cuz it's too broad mostly because I know of those games, but I'm gonna be honest I never really played the super early PC game so much I did.

338
00:23:14,403 --> 00:23:17,080
Rym: I played a bunch of text adventures at school, but I never saved him.

339
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,164
Rym: I just beat him in one go.

340
00:23:18,184 --> 00:23:19,249
Rym: there was nothing else to do at school.

341
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:24,629
Scott: like I didn't play muds until muds had reached the peak of mud technology I never played the Zork's.

342
00:23:25,093 --> 00:23:31,759
Rym: I couldn't save Mad maze in prodigy online because my modem was only 2,400 bought and it wasn't fast enough.

343
00:23:32,302 --> 00:23:33,628
Scott: Mad maze was great though.

344
00:23:33,648 --> 00:23:34,231
Scott: I love mad.

345
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,060
Rym: I couldn't play it because I couldn't save my game.

346
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:40,067
Rym: I Was so slow I couldn't save.

347
00:23:40,368 --> 00:23:46,076
Rym: so no matter how far I get I'd basically would have had to beat all of mad maze in One go which wasn't gonna happen obviously.

348
00:23:46,096 --> 00:23:49,426
Scott: yeah I played it at a friend's house So I never really cared that.

349
00:23:49,466 --> 00:23:52,397
Scott: I had to start from the beginning every time and actually got pretty far once.

350
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:54,684
Rym: it also took about Two minutes to load each screen.

351
00:23:54,905 --> 00:24:00,984
Scott: see that's something there right we always talk about how we have a band and where to rescue old Games that have been lost.

352
00:24:01,366 --> 00:24:03,073
Scott: mad maze is pretty much lost forever.

353
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:04,760
Scott: Yeah, there's no way to play that game.

354
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,322
Rym: Well, I don't know.

355
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:07,411
Rym: I mean people have got this BS Zelda working.

356
00:24:07,431 --> 00:24:12,096
Rym: That's true, so Somewhere the code might exist.

357
00:24:12,156 --> 00:24:22,294
Scott: hey BS Zelda people when you're done with that get working on mad maze from the original DOS Atari DOS DOS Atari DOS prodigy DOS Atari DOS.

358
00:24:22,374 --> 00:24:23,256
Rym: that was a good game.

359
00:24:23,457 --> 00:24:24,500
Scott: Yeah, DOS prodigy.

360
00:24:25,721 --> 00:24:30,356
Rym: But I mean just think about how different games where you can save versus games where you can't are.

361
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:35,271
Rym: and not talking high score games They're just normal console games like Mario 3 versus Mario world.

362
00:24:35,331 --> 00:24:36,234
Rym: I think that's the biggest.

363
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:36,454
Rym: they're.

364
00:24:36,735 --> 00:24:42,019
Rym: they're effectively the same game Except for the ability to backtrack and save your progress.

365
00:24:42,866 --> 00:24:44,400
Scott: Yeah, what ends up happening?

366
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:59,321
Scott: I think the most the major factor in having a game that saves is that if your game does not save The beginning parts of the game will be played very very frequently like the first world of Mario 3.

367
00:24:59,321 --> 00:25:06,423
Scott: I've played that so many times, but world 5 or world 6. actually I've barely played world 6 in Mario 3.

368
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:12,096
Scott: I've played it Maybe 3 or 4 times in my life just because it most of the times when I played Mario 3.

369
00:25:12,096 --> 00:25:17,900
Scott: I didn't get that far Yep, and or I would warp past it to world 7 or 8 or ghosts and goblins.

370
00:25:18,241 --> 00:25:22,979
Rym: How many people in this world have actually seen any stage past the second one?

371
00:25:23,862 --> 00:25:34,480
Scott: If you can save your game and you only play the game once through like say Final Fantasy 6 You see every part of the game pretty much once unless you die.

372
00:25:35,122 --> 00:25:38,453
Scott: So you don't see the beginning of Final Fantasy 6 10 times.

373
00:25:38,513 --> 00:25:43,220
Scott: in the end once you see every part Once and it's totally different now.

374
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,759
Rym: We talked about that a lot when we were talking about Mario world.

375
00:25:46,222 --> 00:25:56,790
Rym: so to move on a little bit to something along the same lines it seems like the scope of Difficulty and the nature of the difficulty of a game is changed pretty much 180 degrees.

376
00:25:56,911 --> 00:26:05,300
Rym: if you can save versus if you can't and Depending on the granularity or how often you can save or what cost there is to saving it changes even more.

377
00:26:05,701 --> 00:26:12,977
Rym: Well, I guess you can't change more than 180 degrees without turning also to the right or to the left But we're going on Euclidean here.

378
00:26:14,445 --> 00:26:15,013
Rym: So think of this.

379
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:21,260
Rym: Castlevania 2 Simon's Quest is a good example because I played through this game and beat it on the NES.

380
00:26:21,822 --> 00:26:28,303
Rym: I also played through this game and beat it when I was living in the mountains on an emulator and the game was Entirely different.

381
00:26:28,604 --> 00:26:42,520
Rym: it was so different that it was playing an entirely different game despite the fact that it was actually the exact same game Just with an added ability to save my progress at any point as opposed to you know Basically not being able to save aside from getting a password.

382
00:26:42,821 --> 00:26:47,480
Scott: Well, I think using an emulator was a little different because you can also load at any time.

383
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:50,250
Scott: It's like if there's a hard bad guy, you'll save.

384
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:51,575
Scott: try to beat the bad guy.

385
00:26:51,595 --> 00:26:52,840
Scott: if you die you load.

386
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,599
Rym: Yeah, that's what I was getting at.

387
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,676
Rym: But if you can save at any time, you can obviously load from any point at which you saved.

388
00:26:59,298 --> 00:26:59,800
Scott: that's true.

389
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:06,540
Rym: I wasn't really a distinction there But my point was that playing Castlevania straight through is an incredibly difficult game.

390
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,538
Rym: And let's say you get to a difficult part and you try it and you die.

391
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:17,780
Rym: now You have to go through most of if not all of the game again to get to that point after you've lost all your lives.

392
00:27:18,242 --> 00:27:22,260
Rym: So if a part is difficult, you don't get much time to practice it.

393
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:27,540
Rym: In fact, the most difficult parts of the game give you the least opportunity to try them and practice them.

394
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:34,520
Rym: So as a result, it becomes this monolithic insurmountable challenge like this mountain in the distance like in Hitler.

395
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,636
Rym: No, Fukatsu by the commando, you know that jump at the end is coming up.

396
00:27:38,917 --> 00:27:42,066
Rym: You know, it's coming The whole game you're waiting for it.

397
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:45,756
Rym: You finally get there you jump you've got one shot you fuck it up.

398
00:27:45,796 --> 00:27:46,178
Rym: It's over.

399
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:58,860
Rym: Yep Now you can save your game save my state every time there's a difficult part and instead of having the cost of Going back and playing through all the game again every time I fail there is no cost to failure.

400
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:05,500
Rym: I can play every individual issue every individual jump infinitely until I do it perfectly.

401
00:28:06,022 --> 00:28:10,560
Scott: Well, I think what it does is it shows you that we used to think games were harder.

402
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:16,560
Scott: But maybe the tasks that the games required to you to accomplish weren't actually more difficult.

403
00:28:17,082 --> 00:28:22,125
Scott: They just required you to do a whole bunch of stuff to get enough tries like they'll be a jump.

404
00:28:22,526 --> 00:28:28,667
Scott: the jump itself isn't that hard, but it's a little bit hard and You're not gonna get that jump on the first try.

405
00:28:28,687 --> 00:28:49,567
Scott: and if you have to redo a whole level just to get another try At the jump and if that level is maybe not the easiest walk in the park Just having to put in the time and the effort to go through that level Sort of you know wears on you and increases the difficulty of the jump when the jump on its own Isn't really so difficult.

406
00:28:49,607 --> 00:28:51,053
Rym: Megaman did that to me a lot.

407
00:28:51,073 --> 00:28:59,934
Rym: when you're playing through Megaman to get to the boss You know the robot master and along the way, you know, if you're not good I'm not good at Megaman games more damage you take.

408
00:29:00,276 --> 00:29:01,120
Rym: make sure you can heal.

409
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:09,073
Rym: But you might get to the boss without all your health or in a non-optimal Configuration because you're not perfect at the rest of the level.

410
00:29:09,093 --> 00:29:11,799
Rym: if you can't save your game You've got to deal with that.

411
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:16,340
Rym: So working on the being super good at the whole level becomes much more imperative.

412
00:29:16,722 --> 00:29:20,660
Rym: Learning all the skills of avoiding each individual monster becomes a lot more critical.

413
00:29:20,981 --> 00:29:23,690
Rym: Yeah, but you can save your state if you get through it.

414
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:26,640
Rym: once you save your state at the boss and just keep trying the.

415
00:29:26,961 --> 00:29:31,700
Scott: Well, the thing is in Megaman if you die at a boss you reappear right before the boss.

416
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:38,562
Rym: Yeah, but even then yeah now you have to at least get through the level having one life left That's true.

417
00:29:38,582 --> 00:29:42,580
Rym: or each life you have left is one more try against the boss, especially if it's a hard boss.

418
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:46,460
Scott: Yeah, the other thing is you won't get back any of your weapons.

419
00:29:46,741 --> 00:29:55,640
Scott: So if you need a certain weapon to beat the boss and you don't have enough of it left because you had to use it In the level then you could be in trouble because then you'll have to like you'll use the weapon on the boss.

420
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,265
Scott: He won't be dead.

421
00:29:56,285 --> 00:29:57,960
Scott: You have to use the regular weapon or something.

422
00:29:58,341 --> 00:30:01,712
Rym: It's like adding the ability to save and load to a game that didn't have.

423
00:30:01,772 --> 00:30:05,322
Rym: it completely alters the risk/reward ratio Mm-hmm.

424
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:08,520
Rym: There is now zero risk in trying risky things.

425
00:30:08,821 --> 00:30:09,947
Rym: so you're not as afraid.

426
00:30:09,987 --> 00:30:19,772
Rym: you lose that sense of fear or that sense of if I don't survive this if I don't make it out of this cave and use this tent and save my game I'm not gonna have as tosses fucking crown.

427
00:30:19,832 --> 00:30:21,159
Rym: I'm to go to that Marsh cave again.

428
00:30:21,882 --> 00:30:35,273
Rym: Yeah, you know how many times that happened to me the moment in my life when I probably the most frustrating thing That's ever happened to me in my childhood playing Final Fantasy 1 I went in to the Marsh cave at far too low a level.

429
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:38,343
Rym: I killed those guys those wizard Whatever they were.

430
00:30:38,383 --> 00:30:41,072
Rym: that because of the the mind flayer looking things.

431
00:30:41,554 --> 00:30:43,240
Scott: I got the crown mean the mind flares.

432
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:44,845
Rym: I fought my way out.

433
00:30:45,347 --> 00:30:46,371
Rym: I got to the exit.

434
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:47,615
Rym: I had a tent.

435
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:51,549
Rym: for whatever reason I walked a few steps before I used my tents.

436
00:30:52,472 --> 00:30:54,480
Rym: I was attacked by six ghouls.

437
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:56,708
Rym: I only had two party members left alive.

438
00:30:57,109 --> 00:30:58,133
Rym: They got first strike.

439
00:30:58,354 --> 00:31:00,080
Rym: They paralyzed my two party members.

440
00:31:00,521 --> 00:31:06,839
Rym: I sat there watching as they slowly killed the last two party members and I lost everything that I had done.

441
00:31:07,422 --> 00:31:07,724
Rym: Uh-huh.

442
00:31:08,528 --> 00:31:09,273
Rym: I was a little kid.

443
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:10,298
Rym: I almost cried.

444
00:31:11,322 --> 00:31:17,660
Rym: Well, but at the same time you had such a fear of losing that progress that the game seems so much more intense.

445
00:31:18,563 --> 00:31:31,560
Scott: Well, I think there's a big difference also between games, you know and what they're saving policy is You know I mean the saving policy of a game is huge and I used to think Why the hell don't they just make it so you can save whenever you want?

446
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,378
Scott: They're just assholes.

447
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:39,780
Scott: But really if you ask a lot of the game designers they chose their saving policy very carefully and very intentionally.

448
00:31:40,283 --> 00:31:43,319
Scott: They could have made Final Fantasy save whenever you wanted for free.

449
00:31:43,922 --> 00:31:52,493
Scott: They decided that you need to find a save spot or an inn or a town or a tent Because that's the way they wanted the game to be for they had reasons.

450
00:31:52,894 --> 00:31:54,680
Rym: Yeah, and usually those reasons are pretty good.

451
00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:11,212
Rym: I mean some games don't do it well but Final Fantasy games actually the distance between save points and the the level of frustration and fear you'd have and trying to get to a save point versus the ease of actually saving your game and not becoming too Frustrated was very well done at least in the Final Fantasies.

452
00:32:11,273 --> 00:32:20,120
Rym: I played the good ones that I played Although seven actually did something really really clever with save spots that I'd never seen done before and it totally got me.

453
00:32:20,361 --> 00:32:29,839
Rym: I don't even remember is this if this is not a spoiler because statute of limitations On this early thing in Final Fantasy 7 other than the fact that Eris dies.

454
00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:41,894
Rym: Oh noes so Yuffie you run into her and When she pops up like she's standing there and like there's gonna be an encounter There's also a save spot in the corner of the screen.

455
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:50,969
Rym: so you think good I get to save my game before I deal with whatever this encounter is if you walk over there and try to save your game While the save screen is up.

456
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,196
Rym: It stays black for a little bit.

457
00:32:52,216 --> 00:32:52,800
Rym: You hear a noise.

458
00:32:53,141 --> 00:32:57,999
Rym: It comes back Yuffie's gone and you realize that she just stole all your money while you were busy saving your game.

459
00:32:58,662 --> 00:33:01,439
Rym: Yeah, I was floored by that.

460
00:33:02,221 --> 00:33:03,028
Scott: That's good stuff.

461
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,400
Rym: I was that was so great.

462
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:09,400
Rym: That's like if you put a secret in one of those save rooms or one of those rooms with the missiles in Metroid.

463
00:33:09,841 --> 00:33:16,640
Scott: Yeah, and Metroid like, you know, there usually wouldn't be secrets in rooms that were saved spots, but I guess sometimes there were.

464
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,260
Rym: Yeah, of course also I've allowed a nostalgia just jumping back to remember.

465
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:23,606
Rym: I mean all you young kids.

466
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:29,000
Rym: there was a time when even if a game allowed you to save your progress You couldn't just save your game.

467
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,780
Rym: There wasn't any sort of battery or memory.

468
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:42,320
Rym: The game would give you a password that you had to write down and keep and then remember when you wanted to play that game Again, yeah, I mean the passwords weren't really saving your game.

469
00:33:42,941 --> 00:33:54,120
Scott: it was just you know, there were only so many possible combinations of items you could have and only so many possible Places in the game where someone would tell you the password like in fact Xanadu.

470
00:33:54,481 --> 00:33:59,860
Scott: You could only find out the password from talking to one of like these certain guys in towns.

471
00:34:00,503 --> 00:34:03,860
Scott: So there are only so many places you could possibly get a password.

472
00:34:04,081 --> 00:34:11,779
Scott: There are only so many combinations of items you could have and nothing else really mattered in the game Except what items you had and where you were.

473
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:20,476
Scott: So there are only so many possible passwords that you could have and the password was just you know Symbolic of what items you had and where you were.

474
00:34:20,757 --> 00:34:27,827
Rym: well in fact Let's go to a little more detail on that because I think a lot of gamers especially people from our era might not realize Exactly what a password was.

475
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:29,072
Rym: Scott alluded to it.

476
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:30,458
Scott: I think people know what a password is.

477
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,306
Rym: No No I mean on a very basic level.

478
00:34:33,647 --> 00:34:41,418
Rym: what a password did in those games was turn your brain or your piece of paper Into a very low capacity memory stick.

479
00:34:42,002 --> 00:34:46,879
Rym: Yeah, the password was basically just the code that said how to configure the game for you.

480
00:34:47,181 --> 00:34:47,301
Rym: Yeah,

481
00:34:47,341 --> 00:35:06,295
Scott: I mean like if you opened up a game of Zelda 1 and you looked in the saves you know the stored the memory where the save game goes and you took that memory and you looked at it and say hexadecimal format, you know ABCDEF and 0 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 and You looked at it.

482
00:35:07,222 --> 00:35:07,483
Scott: That would.

483
00:35:07,603 --> 00:35:08,907
Scott: there would be a password wouldn't it?

484
00:35:09,048 --> 00:35:19,485
Scott: if you just instead of having a save spot in the memory where that number would Be stored if you just asked, you know the player to type in the number then How is that any different?

485
00:35:19,545 --> 00:35:23,360
Rym: granted some games had incredibly frustrating password mechanisms for some reason?

486
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,074
Rym: I often would mess up passwords.

487
00:35:26,135 --> 00:35:27,580
Rym: in Metal Gear 1.

488
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,729
Rym: It's just the way it made.

489
00:35:28,749 --> 00:35:29,394
Rym: you put him in.

490
00:35:29,414 --> 00:35:32,531
Rym: I If I recall correctly, it's been a while.

491
00:35:32,571 --> 00:35:34,540
Rym: I don't think you could backspace, huh?

492
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,879
Rym: So if you put if you made a typo it pretty much had to go through the whole process and try again.

493
00:35:39,281 --> 00:35:48,500
Scott: Well, all the good passwords were games like Megaman games or Kid Icarus was pretty good and Metro it occurs and Metroid were okay.

494
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:59,905
Scott: But Megaman games in particular had the best passwords because there was a grid and all you had to do was put either In certain dots in the grid like the grid would be five by five So 25 possible dots.

495
00:36:00,427 --> 00:36:04,020
Scott: you would put like a dotted a1 a dotted blue dot a red dot.

496
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,367
Scott: No, well that was Mega Man 3 and Mega Man 3. there are blue dots and red dots But a Mega Man want to know a trick.

497
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:12,320
Rym: a red dot was actually just a combination of two blue dots.

498
00:36:13,661 --> 00:36:23,238
Rym: I figured out that system and I figured out where to put a combination of dots to give myself nine energy tanks Because there was no check summing in that Mega Man or at least minimal check summing.

499
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:24,343
Rym: See, that's the.

500
00:36:24,624 --> 00:36:36,079
Rym: that's the reason why despite that the password just being a store of information for the game You couldn't just type gibberish and get something weird because a lot of those characters There'd be a check some where it would know if a password was valid.

501
00:36:36,702 --> 00:36:40,295
Rym: Aha or at least it would have a good idea if a password was valid.

502
00:36:40,556 --> 00:36:44,068
Rym: kid Icarus in some games You could totally mess up by putting in.

503
00:36:44,209 --> 00:36:46,999
Rym: in fact kid Icarus and Metroid had weak check summing.

504
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:55,299
Rym: That's why there's so many passwords for kid Icarus that have words in them like Icarus fights Medusa angel or packing packing packing packing or all those other ones.

505
00:36:55,721 --> 00:37:01,740
Rym: Because the check sum was so weak that you could very easily construct a password that you knew would pass the check sum.

506
00:37:02,322 --> 00:37:06,096
Rym: Hmm and you just look for interesting words and then see what those words gave you.

507
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:20,499
Scott: yeah nowadays That we have actual save spots Unless you find some way to Like take that save game memory and modify it by loading it up on your computer and a hex editor Which was trivial in a lot of old PC games.

508
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,922
Scott: It was an old PC games, but not in modern console games Like.

509
00:37:23,963 --> 00:37:37,840
Scott: I can't take my Wii memory card even though it's an SD card and I could load it up on the computer with a hex editor and try to edit it and Maybe increase my Wii Sports score or something, but that's pretty difficult, and it's it's probably not gonna happen.

510
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:45,960
Scott: But if the memory space is only so large I can actually afford to try all sorts of different stuff.

511
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:52,660
Scott: Figure out how to make my own save game, and I don't even need a computer to enter the save game because it's a password.

512
00:37:52,822 --> 00:37:54,539
Scott: I just have to type it in with my gamepad.

513
00:37:55,543 --> 00:38:00,680
Rym: Now also don't forget the games like Zelda that had the the battery save or you could just save your game.

514
00:38:01,223 --> 00:38:02,411
Rym: That was a big deal.

515
00:38:02,451 --> 00:38:05,286
Rym: when that came out in the US That was a huge deal.

516
00:38:05,306 --> 00:38:08,980
Rym: like I was back then when games started you could just save the game.

517
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,240
Rym: I was a little bit dumbfounded by it.

518
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,076
Rym: It was such an amazing idea And I was so impressed by it.

519
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:21,639
Rym: Little did I know that the batteries if you don't keep playing the game and even sometimes just randomly only lasts about five years.

520
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:27,159
Scott: Pretty much everyone had their battery die, but if you open my Zelda 2 battery didn't die.

521
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:31,896
Scott: well If you open up the cartridge everyone you can look at the battery and it's a commonly available battery.

522
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,020
Scott: you can replace those things.

523
00:38:33,422 --> 00:38:34,407
Scott: It's well known how to do.

524
00:38:34,447 --> 00:38:35,351
Scott: the internet will tell you.

525
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:39,969
Scott: it won't tell us because we don't have internet But the internet knows how to replace those batteries.

526
00:38:40,009 --> 00:38:40,651
Scott: It's not hard.

527
00:38:40,691 --> 00:38:49,448
Scott: many people have done it you know and the only thing I think they could have done better is if the battery was easily removable instead of having to open the cartridge Which is a little bit tricky.

528
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:53,569
Rym: you know this just gave me a crazy idea Totally out of the blue.

529
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:54,638
Rym: I'm sure someone might have done it.

530
00:38:54,980 --> 00:39:02,272
Rym: What if we just made an NES cartridge that had a USB coming out of the end and you could just send data to an NES In real time and play games that way?

531
00:39:02,332 --> 00:39:02,815
Scott: it's called it.

532
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:03,580
Scott: It's called dev kit.

533
00:39:04,103 --> 00:39:06,093
Rym: Yeah, well what if I could make one or get a hold of one?

534
00:39:06,495 --> 00:39:07,500
Scott: you mean an emulator?

535
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,513
Rym: Yeah, but it's not cool unless I'm playing it on an actual Nintendo.

536
00:39:11,533 --> 00:39:18,152
Rym: now a relatively Recent development in save games has come about that has really obviated.

537
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:33,800
Rym: one of the biggest problems in save game ideas Was that if you want to have a limited possibility of saving games for whatever gameplay reasons, and you're a game developer You have to balance that originally with letting someone save the game when their life is more important.

538
00:39:34,424 --> 00:39:36,980
Rym: I mean how many times were you a kid and you were playing a game?

539
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,920
Rym: And then your mom says it's time to go eat dinner, and what are you gonna?

540
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:40,201
Rym: Do?

541
00:39:40,502 --> 00:39:42,148
Rym: you can't just leave Mario pause?

542
00:39:42,368 --> 00:39:45,399
Rym: sometimes the NES would crash if you left it pause for too long mm-hmm.

543
00:39:45,901 --> 00:39:58,335
Rym: Or if it's a game like Final Fantasy you have to finish fighting the antlion and then get out of that cave Before you can save your game, and if your mom says you got to leave now Usually she just come over and unplug the SNES.

544
00:39:58,677 --> 00:40:05,040
Scott: one other problem We've got is that we've got a lot of games that there is no saving no matter what because it's some real-time multiplayer game.

545
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:11,520
Scott: But there are also a lot of turn-based multiplayer games, and we can save them, but loading them is kind of tricky.

546
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,583
Scott: It's like whoa.

547
00:40:12,723 --> 00:40:18,620
Scott: how do we load these things when there's multi multiple people playing possibly on different computers in different places?

548
00:40:19,062 --> 00:40:36,219
Rym: Well the thing I'm going for is that this was solved so amazingly beautifully by the Instant suspend or instant save that has been or quick save that has been slowly being put in many many many games And the DS with its suspend mode does something similarly useful.

549
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,567
Rym: Castlevania is a good example of this.

550
00:40:38,608 --> 00:40:43,511
Rym: the DS versions say you're playing and You have to save your game in a save spot.

551
00:40:43,612 --> 00:40:45,020
Rym: You can't just save your game anywhere.

552
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,845
Rym: You have to get to a save spot to save your game But you can also do a quick save.

553
00:40:49,226 --> 00:40:55,946
Rym: where a breath of fire 2 does this on the GBA - you can save the game in This weird quick save spot.

554
00:40:56,307 --> 00:41:04,300
Rym: and the way it works is you save the game at any point any time you can save it But if you load that save game it gets deleted.

555
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:10,500
Rym: So you can't save your progress in the traditional sense of if I fail I could return to this point.

556
00:41:10,941 --> 00:41:16,260
Rym: So the game the game developer loses nothing from his risk/reward ratio calculations.

557
00:41:16,763 --> 00:41:25,059
Rym: He doesn't have to sacrifice the ability to make you sweat it But yet you can save the game if your house is on fire, and you got to deal with that business.

558
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:34,260
Scott: Mmm, yeah There are really two purposes to saving and that is if I'm going to stop playing and come back and continue playing later.

559
00:41:34,842 --> 00:41:36,467
Scott: That's one reason to save a game.

560
00:41:36,748 --> 00:41:42,107
Scott: the other reason to save a game is like you know aha I've just completed a difficult task.

561
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,412
Scott: click now.

562
00:41:43,472 --> 00:41:45,400
Scott: I never have to complete that difficult task again.

563
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:53,114
Scott: It is accomplished and now I will march forth to the next task and I can always start from this point Where those previous tasks are completed.

564
00:41:53,275 --> 00:42:01,920
Scott: yep and Separating those two I think is actually a really fantastic idea because when they weren't separated things really kind of sucks still.

565
00:42:02,422 --> 00:42:08,439
Rym: Yeah, whiz I never beat Wizards and Warriors 3 because I couldn't save my game And I just it was too much hassle to play through that game.

566
00:42:08,962 --> 00:42:11,714
Rym: Yep, plus the the furthest I ever got.

567
00:42:11,814 --> 00:42:24,940
Rym: our parents made us go eat dinner So my brother and I took turns running over to the NES Unpausing it and pausing it and then at one time my brother ran out And then I hear him yell, and I run over and the game wouldn't unpause.

568
00:42:27,048 --> 00:42:27,980
Rym: I was horrible.

569
00:42:28,864 --> 00:42:38,340
Rym: That's a bad one but yeah This is the idea that you should be able to stop playing a game at any moment if your life is more important and by Allowing people to do it with something like a quick save.

570
00:42:38,621 --> 00:42:44,060
Rym: There is absolutely zero cost to the developer in terms of his idea of how the game should work.

571
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,327
Rym: So you can't lose anything.

572
00:42:45,669 --> 00:42:46,051
Rym: all you have.

573
00:42:46,072 --> 00:42:47,480
Rym: just all you have to gain is everything.

574
00:42:47,996 --> 00:43:04,180
Scott: Yeah It's like you still have to make it from point A to point B without dying or else the game will send you back to point A. However, you know if you don't want to do it all in one sitting if you want to do it in three or four sittings You know you go like half the way you quick save then you come back later.

575
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,759
Scott: You start from where you quick saved, but if you die you're going back to point A. You're not going back to this quick save spot.

576
00:43:10,181 --> 00:43:17,986
Scott: You still have to accomplish the same goals take the same risks and achieve the same rewards and everything But you can go back to your life.

577
00:43:18,207 --> 00:43:22,279
Scott: They separate those two things and a game is much more awesome now.

578
00:43:22,339 --> 00:43:32,150
Rym: lately I'll finish with this I've been playing bionic commando a lot again kind of randomly and the fact that the GBA version that also has other games on it Doesn't add anything to the game at all.

579
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:33,054
Rym: You can't save.

580
00:43:33,094 --> 00:43:33,937
Rym: there's no save stage.

581
00:43:33,957 --> 00:43:36,680
Rym: There's nothing It's just an NES emulator.

582
00:43:37,463 --> 00:44:03,884
Rym: The fact that it's that way and that I can't save my progress has in the end Greatly enhanced my enjoyment of bionic commando because by playing through the game in the old-school way I've gotten really really really good at that game now and I can play the end parts of the game with ease Where if I could have saved the game I probably would have gotten to the end once Difficultly early on saved it and then always just come back to my fully decked out game and just played the levels I liked occasionally.

583
00:44:03,904 --> 00:44:07,437
Rym: I play the game more because I'm more restricted in how I play it.

584
00:44:07,577 --> 00:44:09,083
Rym: It's kind of weird Huh?

585
00:44:09,103 --> 00:44:13,900
Scott: Yeah, I do kind of noticed that like if I had a game of Mario 3 or more like Mario World.

586
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,302
Scott: Here we go.

587
00:44:14,342 --> 00:44:15,266
Scott: Mario World, right?

588
00:44:15,607 --> 00:44:18,940
Scott: Let's say I thought my goal is to beat Mario World 100%.

589
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:27,493
Scott: I'm still working on it, even though I haven't had a lot of time lately, but when I do it I'm gonna have this game that save a hundred percent Mario World.

590
00:44:27,854 --> 00:44:29,800
Scott: So why would I play that game?

591
00:44:29,881 --> 00:44:31,695
Scott: I can open it up and I can see.

592
00:44:31,897 --> 00:44:39,348
Scott: aha Look at this hundred percent completed game and there's some levels that I like a lot like maybe the last level The world with Kuriboh shoe in it.

593
00:44:39,569 --> 00:44:40,776
Scott: Yeah, the world of Kuriboh shoe.

594
00:44:40,796 --> 00:44:44,934
Scott: in Mario 3 I would play that a bunch of times like in Super Mario all-stars.

595
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:49,175
Scott: You can save your Mario 3 game Yeah, and I may be on the GBA version of Mario 3.

596
00:44:49,175 --> 00:44:51,488
Scott: You can also save it I'm not sure but I'm betting you can.

597
00:44:52,191 --> 00:44:57,233
Scott: so I would go back and play these levels I like but I wouldn't go back and play hard annoying levels.

598
00:44:57,293 --> 00:44:58,939
Scott: I wouldn't play the first level.

599
00:44:59,442 --> 00:45:05,707
Scott: Like a lot of the game just would never get replayed ever Because I don't want to.

600
00:45:06,008 --> 00:45:09,720
Rym: and it's almost one of those situations where filet mignon is great.

601
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:13,560
Rym: But if you eat it every day, it starts to lose its luster.

602
00:45:13,982 --> 00:45:16,679
Rym: You start to get not sick of it necessarily because it's still great.

603
00:45:17,262 --> 00:45:32,380
Rym: But if you have the choice of eating the same thing every day And it's really good or you have the choice of playing the five levels that you really really really like all the time You'll get sick of those and it's almost like by being forced to play all the levels which are also good.

604
00:45:32,882 --> 00:45:36,440
Rym: You're forced to enjoy the game more than you would have if you just had the selective play.

605
00:45:37,004 --> 00:45:44,120
Scott: Yeah, cuz I mean if there's a game you like, you know I mean, I'm sure there might be a game out there that has a bad part that you just don't like doing.

606
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:58,410
Scott: But for the most part like shooting Hitler's face-off in the end of bionic fucking commando Yeah, but I mean for the most part Yeah, most of you playing a video game most of the parts of the game are going to be fun in some way.

607
00:45:59,012 --> 00:46:09,649
Scott: So if you are given the option to play any part of the game you want at any time You know because you've beaten the whole thing already You're just gonna play a few of the parts and not all of them.

608
00:46:09,951 --> 00:46:17,743
Rym: So I guess it's kind of like with creativity in terms of sometimes your limitations can end up being your greatest assets and the limitations of a game.

609
00:46:18,352 --> 00:46:19,619
Rym: Sometimes I mean not always.

610
00:46:19,659 --> 00:46:28,429
Rym: we're not saying that all games should be this way But a game that's limited in those ways can often be a better game as a result of it Even if you don't see that right away.

611
00:46:28,971 --> 00:46:46,459
Scott: Yeah, also, I like to I just realized you look at a game like Resident Evil 4 right or chrono trigger where all right You you can save the game and you can beat the game But you're never in a situation where you can just go to any part of the game you want and play only the parts you Want you.

612
00:46:46,621 --> 00:47:01,450
Scott: when you beat it It starts you over from the beginning and like a plus better mode where you can have you can re-experience the whole game With your advanced skills perhaps on a higher difficulty level, but with you know your equipments from before.

613
00:47:02,233 --> 00:47:06,750
Scott: So you can experience the same game again from beginning to end.

614
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:24,793
Scott: You know not just picking parts here and there like in a Mario world, but you can still save along the way But you still have to go through it and you're getting the same fun things that you had the first time as if it was A game where you couldn't save and you like buy on a commando where you had to play from the beginning every time or like The Zelda second quest.

615
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:26,940
Rym: All right, I guess we'll wrap this up.

616
00:47:27,361 --> 00:47:28,785
Rym: It's still weird not having internet.

617
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,210
Rym: My teleprompter is still blank.

618
00:47:30,693 --> 00:47:31,417
Rym: It's kind of creepy.

619
00:47:31,538 --> 00:47:32,403
Rym: I can't just look at it.

620
00:47:32,443 --> 00:47:33,590
Rym: I have the comfort of that glow.

621
00:47:33,933 --> 00:47:35,450
Scott: Hopefully this will be fixed tomorrow.

622
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:44,440
Rym: Emily said she will not let the cable guy leave until the cable light comes on which I imagine might end with him tied up In the closet because I don't think they're gonna fix it.

623
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,650
Rym: I think this is gonna be this horrible ordeal.

624
00:47:47,254 --> 00:47:52,422
Scott: I don't know what it's gonna be but I'm gonna do my damnedest to make sure it's repaired.

625
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:57,870
Rym: the internet will be back someday But suffice to say we've got to work around and GeekNights is gonna keep going up.

626
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:59,318
Rym: We're not gonna stop because of this.

627
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,470
Rym: so take that all you lazy podcasters.

628
00:48:02,351 --> 00:48:08,890
Scott: Yeah, I don't see anyone else driving 10 minutes down the run not even 10 minutes down the road to upload their shows.

629
00:48:10,074 --> 00:48:11,309
Rym: You can't upload 10 shows.
