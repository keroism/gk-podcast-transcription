1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,065
Scott: It's Thursday, July 24th.

2
00:00:11,085 --> 00:00:11,827
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,228 --> 00:00:13,210
Scott: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,974
Scott: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,034 --> 00:00:17,580
Scott: Tonight, the demise of the dinner.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,478
Rym: Da da da da!

7
00:00:22,912 --> 00:00:23,361
Rym: The... Demise.

8
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:23,963
Scott: No, no, no.

9
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:26,010
Scott: What's a word that's synonym with demise?

10
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:26,933
Scott: Let's do this.

11
00:00:27,174 --> 00:00:28,800
Scott: The something of the supper.

12
00:00:30,922 --> 00:00:34,780
Rym: I created somewhat of a modern spectacle on the train home today.

13
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:37,660
Scott: What could you possibly have done to make a spectacle?

14
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,171
Rym: Well, the thing is, basically, everyone who walked by did a double take.

15
00:00:41,411 --> 00:00:44,280
Rym: Well, you know, because I got on the train, I took a slightly later train.

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,479
Scott: I took a way later train.

17
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,466
Rym: So I get on this train, you know, like 20 minutes before it's gonna leave.

18
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:54,220
Rym: So as a result, a lot of people walk past me and almost every single one of them stop and did some sort of double take at me.

19
00:00:54,782 --> 00:00:55,458
Scott: What were you doing?

20
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,740
Rym: So I had to bring my work laptop back to work to get some stuff done to it before I brought it home again.

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,604
Rym: And, you know, I have my normal laptop.

22
00:01:02,665 --> 00:01:05,450
Rym: I do stuff on and the work laptop is bigger.

23
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:08,920
Rym: It's a desktop replacement that I use, like, you know, for work.

24
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:10,745
Rym: Got this encrypted hard drive.

25
00:01:10,765 --> 00:01:14,700
Rym: It's kind of like if I go on a trip, but it's a business trip or I'm working from home.

26
00:01:15,321 --> 00:01:17,714
Rym: I use this thing and, you know, VPNs into the work network.

27
00:01:17,774 --> 00:01:18,900
Rym: It's got all the work software.

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,244
Scott: I guess that's all right.

29
00:01:20,284 --> 00:01:24,220
Scott: I mean, if you're not carrying it too often, then it won't be a physical burden.

30
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:31,080
Scott: And that way you don't have to mess up any of your own computers and you can keep your work computing and home computing perfectly separate.

31
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,029
Rym: Best part is it's got all the work software.

32
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:37,880
Rym: I've got like the like the full on Adobe in the office and all those things.

33
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,140
Rym: Yeah, I know the Oracle, all my server things, everything I could possibly need for work is on there.

34
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,171
Scott: That's good, because, you know, like I know most of my work is Linux.

35
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,400
Scott: All I really need to do is SSH to the work server.

36
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:55,980
Scott: But if I had some sort of pre-configured separate work machine, that was, you know, a laptop be good, too, because then I could, you know, give it back more easily.

37
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,471
Rym: Part of that's that, you know, I don't have admin access on it.

38
00:01:58,512 --> 00:02:00,000
Rym: I just have my normal work access.

39
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:00,964
Scott: Yeah, that's fine.

40
00:02:01,145 --> 00:02:01,326
Scott: Yeah.

41
00:02:01,527 --> 00:02:02,975
Scott: Because you're only going to work with it.

42
00:02:02,995 --> 00:02:03,840
Scott: You're not going to do anything else.

43
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:09,199
Rym: But if I need another laptop for whatever reason, I can just boot in Ubuntu CD and rock.

44
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:10,184
Scott: Oh, definitely.

45
00:02:10,204 --> 00:02:10,847
Rym: I already tried that.

46
00:02:10,887 --> 00:02:11,590
Rym: It works just fine.

47
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,554
Scott: Of course, it works just fine.

48
00:02:12,575 --> 00:02:13,760
Scott: It's a normal Dell laptop.

49
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:17,235
Rym: I had to take it in and I don't have a bag that fits this thing.

50
00:02:17,255 --> 00:02:18,380
Rym: So basically I just carried it.

51
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:19,745
Rym: And on the way in, that's fine.

52
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:23,800
Rym: I just put it in my lap, went to sleep, you know, listening to some movies you should see.

53
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:25,805
Rym: They actually did a good show.

54
00:02:26,086 --> 00:02:26,809
Rym: It was very simple.

55
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:29,620
Rym: It's the kind of thing I'd like to do a week as Thursday about.

56
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,030
Scott: Man, I like them and I like their show.

57
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:36,220
Scott: And Rich, I am following him on Twitter.

58
00:02:36,761 --> 00:02:37,213
Rym: But, but, but.

59
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,713
Scott: I just don't listen to it anymore.

60
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:39,199
Scott: I don't know why.

61
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:41,147
Rym: See, I started listening to it again.

62
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:44,440
Rym: And as a result, I started watching a lot of movies again.

63
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,166
Scott: I just sort of saturated with podcasts in general.

64
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:52,460
Scott: I mean, there are podcasts I subscribe to where I just like every episode, like it appears in the thing and I just lead it.

65
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,740
Rym: I actually listen to every single episode of every podcast to which I am subscribed, which is like four.

66
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:07,480
Scott: Well, the thing is, is like on the train, you know, it's like I've been I only I've been listening to less podcasts and doing more, you know, book reading and comic reading and video games.

67
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,847
Rym: See, I'm doing 50/50 now.

68
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:11,420
Rym: What I'll do is I'll either an anime watching.

69
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,953
Rym: I'll either watch an anime or watch a movie or, you know, work on like a blog stuff.

70
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:17,598
Rym: I got all these half written articles.

71
00:03:17,678 --> 00:03:18,260
Rym: I got to finish.

72
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:24,680
Rym: But the other half the time I'll place it for or something and listen to podcasts at the same time.

73
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,868
Scott: Yeah, pretty much all my activities are taken aback.

74
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:29,920
Scott: My podcast listening is taking a backseat to the other thing.

75
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,950
Rym: I really only listen to movies you should see.

76
00:03:32,031 --> 00:03:33,740
Rym: Dave and Joel and Anime World Order.

77
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,644
Scott: I listen to a few.

78
00:03:34,926 --> 00:03:35,951
Rym: Oh, and NPR.

79
00:03:36,152 --> 00:03:36,956
Rym: It's all politics.

80
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:37,740
Rym: I love that show.

81
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,580
Scott: I listen to some more than that, but well, I guess I'm subscribed to more than that, but I'm not listening.

82
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,586
Scott: And a lot of the ones I'm subscribed to are short.

83
00:03:44,646 --> 00:03:45,911
Rym: You know what else I'm subscribed to?

84
00:03:45,951 --> 00:03:46,473
Rym: Let's see.

85
00:03:47,276 --> 00:03:48,399
Rym: Twelve Byzantine emperors.

86
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:50,888
Rym: Yeah, I have listened to it all again.

87
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:52,616
Rym: But other than that, great.

88
00:03:52,636 --> 00:03:53,560
Rym: There are going to be new ones.

89
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,169
Rym: I hope I hope I hope he does a podcast on Venice.

90
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,740
Scott: Venice is awesome anyway.

91
00:03:59,121 --> 00:04:02,453
Rym: So on the way home, you know, I'm awake, I'm not sleeping and I want to do stuff.

92
00:04:02,514 --> 00:04:04,240
Rym: So I don't have anywhere to put this laptop.

93
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:11,440
Rym: So I've got this laptop on my lap and resting on top of it is my other laptop, which is open and I'm using.

94
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,202
Scott: All right.

95
00:04:12,523 --> 00:04:17,899
Rym: So people are walking by and they see me with a laptop on my lap closed and another laptop open.

96
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:20,910
Rym: And they'd stop and look at it like, what the fuck?

97
00:04:21,332 --> 00:04:21,793
Scott: Why is it?

98
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:22,295
Scott: what the fuck?

99
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:23,440
Scott: Just to have two laptops.

100
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,021
Rym: I don't know.

101
00:04:24,082 --> 00:04:24,483
Rym: It's kind of.

102
00:04:24,704 --> 00:04:26,492
Rym: it's kind of weird to have two laptops, I guess.

103
00:04:27,015 --> 00:04:28,200
Scott: I don't know what's so weird about it.

104
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,069
Scott: I know people with a lot more than two laptops.

105
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:31,616
Rym: Yes, but to have two on you.

106
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:32,400
Scott: Why not?

107
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:33,323
Rym: I don't know.

108
00:04:33,383 --> 00:04:34,749
Rym: People looked at me like it was weird.

109
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:36,960
Rym: Everyone who walked by looked like, what's he doing?

110
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,547
Scott: I saw a guy sitting next to me on the train today.

111
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:40,731
Scott: He had a Blackberry.

112
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:42,757
Scott: And then from his pocket, he pulled out a cell phone.

113
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:43,660
Rym: Not weird.

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,811
Rym: See, that's not weird at all, though, because most people have like the work Blackberry.

115
00:04:46,892 --> 00:04:48,960
Scott: Two laptops is no weirder.

116
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:54,000
Rym: I think two laptops is kind of weirder because there's no possible reason to have two laptops out.

117
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:54,762
Scott: Yeah, there is.

118
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:55,404
Scott: Why?

119
00:04:55,505 --> 00:04:57,411
Scott: To protect your lab from the other laptop.

120
00:04:57,552 --> 00:04:59,840
Scott: That's ludicrous because it's real warm.

121
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:06,220
Rym: I mean, while I was doing this, I did actually have the Blackberry out because I was transferring stuff from the Blackberry to my laptop with the Bluetooth.

122
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:10,235
Rym: I didn't pull my cell phone out because I'm not going to call anyone on the train.

123
00:05:10,335 --> 00:05:11,380
Scott: Yeah, no.

124
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,365
Scott: But there was a meeting at work.

125
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:18,780
Scott: But then like one that one of the bosses who was in on the meeting wasn't there when it was time for the meeting.

126
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,992
Scott: The other one was on the phone and wouldn't get off the phone.

127
00:05:21,032 --> 00:05:22,400
Scott: And so the meeting was late.

128
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:24,045
Scott: And then it was even later.

129
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:27,496
Scott: So I took away later train and I got home like 10 minutes ago into my work.

130
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,084
Rym: Made me late all the time.

131
00:05:30,144 --> 00:05:30,565
Rym: I quit.

132
00:05:30,726 --> 00:05:31,569
Scott: It's not all the time.

133
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:32,051
Scott: It's one.

134
00:05:32,071 --> 00:05:34,359
Rym: Yeah, it is because you get home a lot later than you want to.

135
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:36,245
Scott: And what can I do about it?

136
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:36,647
Rym: Quit.

137
00:05:36,848 --> 00:05:38,154
Rym: Like you said, you always what are you?

138
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:39,440
Rym: Are you a Barack?

139
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,322
Scott: Where am I going?

140
00:05:40,342 --> 00:05:41,024
Scott: Who am I going to go?

141
00:05:41,044 --> 00:05:43,070
Rym: I thought it was easy to get another job.

142
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,400
Scott: I thought your advice is easy to get another job.

143
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,689
Scott: It's not easy to get another job with cool peoples.

144
00:05:49,272 --> 00:05:49,654
Rym: I don't know.

145
00:05:49,694 --> 00:05:50,959
Rym: I got a job with awesome people.

146
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:52,726
Scott: Yeah, but I want your job.

147
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,432
Scott: Your job has other problems.

148
00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:56,400
Rym: What problem could my job possibly have?

149
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:04,120
Scott: I work in a company where, by and large, everyone is smarter than me because the actual work is not something I want to do, which is the most important thing.

150
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:05,644
Rym: My work is awesome.

151
00:06:06,145 --> 00:06:07,168
Rym: I'm not doing.

152
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:08,332
Scott: I wouldn't be doing I.T.

153
00:06:08,372 --> 00:06:08,813
Scott: work there.

154
00:06:08,853 --> 00:06:09,756
Scott: If I was doing I.T.

155
00:06:09,796 --> 00:06:11,060
Scott: work there, I would take your job.

156
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:12,244
Scott: That would be just fine.

157
00:06:12,304 --> 00:06:12,846
Scott: I could do that.

158
00:06:13,328 --> 00:06:14,091
Scott: Be moving V.M.

159
00:06:14,111 --> 00:06:16,098
Scott: wares and you know, that sort of thing.

160
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:16,720
Scott: I can do that.

161
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,285
Rym: What kind of job do you want?

162
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,107
Scott: I want the head.

163
00:06:19,388 --> 00:06:23,160
Scott: Well, my job is slowly becoming the job I want, which is why it's kind of cool.

164
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,193
Scott: We're like we're switching from the PHP to the Jango's and like the things.

165
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:30,760
Scott: it's like the things that we're suggesting are actually happening.

166
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,107
Scott: Like we made a wiki for documentation.

167
00:06:34,187 --> 00:06:40,260
Scott: And it's like even though we got bought out, it's like now our opinions are somehow mattering more.

168
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,660
Scott: And we're leaning more in the direction of what we the programmers want to do.

169
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,032
Rym: But at the same time, you got to stay late.

170
00:06:46,112 --> 00:06:47,580
Rym: Take a later train.

171
00:06:48,281 --> 00:06:50,532
Scott: Well, maybe, you know, that won't be a problem in the future.

172
00:06:50,553 --> 00:06:51,960
Rym: We'll see demand more vacation days.

173
00:06:52,561 --> 00:06:57,060
Scott: Well, I already I got more vacation days and we got bought automatically to get more sell.

174
00:06:57,621 --> 00:07:02,600
Scott: Well, the thing is now I can't just negotiate that with my boss because now he's an employee, too.

175
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,275
Scott: We need to negotiate that with people in North Carolina.

176
00:07:05,295 --> 00:07:06,100
Scott: So it's more difficult.

177
00:07:08,341 --> 00:07:09,325
Rym: So you got we'll see.

178
00:07:09,365 --> 00:07:10,912
Scott: I'm not going to work at this place forever.

179
00:07:10,932 --> 00:07:11,535
Scott: I mean, come on.

180
00:07:11,575 --> 00:07:12,740
Scott: I've worked there for two years.

181
00:07:13,382 --> 00:07:17,693
Rym: I honestly it's weird, but I worked at IBM and that was really fun.

182
00:07:17,713 --> 00:07:20,100
Rym: But, you know, I had I couldn't just work at IBM my whole life.

183
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,160
Rym: So now I work to the hospital and you all know my opinion of the hospital.

184
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,340
Rym: There were there were a lot of reasons why I left the hospital and then it was sick.

185
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:42,540
Rym: Yeah, that was one of the reasons, you know, I can't complain too much about a job where at one point after my third boss quit and they didn't know like they knew they needed me to do work.

186
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,445
Rym: There was a lot of work that needed doing.

187
00:07:44,906 --> 00:07:50,720
Rym: So they basically sent me off to do all the kind of weird work that required judgment on the spot, kind of like a ship's captain.

188
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,880
Rym: How in the army, no one's really out on his own because there's supply lines all the way back.

189
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,202
Rym: I'm talking Napoleonic days.

190
00:07:57,663 --> 00:08:07,180
Rym: So you could send orders pretty easily to most of the people doing all this stuff, but you could send a ship halfway around the world and you don't know if you're going to make peace or war.

191
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:09,045
Rym: I mean, how often in Horatio is he out?

192
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:11,573
Rym: They see a Spanish ship and they're like, shit, are we at war?

193
00:08:11,874 --> 00:08:12,375
Rym: I don't know.

194
00:08:12,636 --> 00:08:13,679
Rym: Let's see if they shoot at us.

195
00:08:14,946 --> 00:08:15,520
Rym: Crap, we're at war.

196
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:21,918
Scott: Because if you're real close to Spain, then and you're from England or UK, whatever, I guess in those days.

197
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:22,400
Scott: Yeah, England.

198
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,909
Scott: Then, you know, you've been away from England for X days.

199
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:30,080
Scott: They've been away from Spain for maybe a few hours, depending on how close to Spain you are.

200
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:35,179
Scott: So there's a good chance they know the most current news, but you don't know the most current news.

201
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:38,648
Rym: But at the same time, say you think you're at peace.

202
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,352
Rym: They know you're at war.

203
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:41,433
Rym: But what if you go the other way around?

204
00:08:41,715 --> 00:08:42,616
Rym: They know there's peace.

205
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:43,880
Rym: You think it's still war.

206
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,117
Rym: You're out there and the Spanish ship is coming up and they're yelling, no, no, peace.

207
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:48,860
Scott: No, don't shoot.

208
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:53,474
Scott: They could be faking it, you know, and then pull a surprise attack.

209
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,120
Scott: You could do the same thing.

210
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:55,761
Rym: Yes.

211
00:08:55,781 --> 00:09:00,920
Rym: So ship's captains were given incredible leeway to, you know, make judgment calls back then.

212
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,200
Scott: Of course, if you fucked up, you know what happened.

213
00:09:03,381 --> 00:09:03,603
Scott: Yes.

214
00:09:03,683 --> 00:09:06,380
Rym: With great responsibility comes great risk.

215
00:09:06,682 --> 00:09:07,360
Scott: Comes great hanging.

216
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,806
Scott: Hanging is frequent, pretty much.

217
00:09:10,826 --> 00:09:12,009
Scott: If you do this, you will be hanged.

218
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:13,955
Scott: If you do this, you'll be hanged.

219
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:26,720
Rym: My favorite part is that if you read the articles of war, it's like, if you are convicted of doing such and such, to be hanged or lesser such penalty as deemed appropriate, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

220
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,839
Rym: But then it hits a couple of them like mutiny and it's like to be hanged.

221
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:32,951
Scott: It's not to be hanged.

222
00:09:33,093 --> 00:09:33,960
Scott: It's hanged.

223
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,461
Rym: No, no, no.

224
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:37,752
Rym: It's to be hanged, but there's none of that or lesser such punishment.

225
00:09:37,993 --> 00:09:40,019
Rym: There isn't even the option of doing less to you.

226
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,401
Scott: Yeah.

227
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:50,100
Scott: It's pretty much like, I don't know how many times the ratio, the books and the movies there, they're just like, you know what the penalty is for that hanging.

228
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:53,740
Scott: There's nothing we can do to save you, even though we know that you did it for a good reason.

229
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,958
Rym: So Horatio does something awesome to get the guy off.

230
00:09:56,281 --> 00:09:56,582
Scott: Yeah.

231
00:09:57,266 --> 00:09:58,894
Scott: It's like, there's no way off the hook, man.

232
00:09:58,935 --> 00:09:59,417
Scott: It's hanging.

233
00:09:59,457 --> 00:09:59,799
Scott: That's it.

234
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:04,660
Rym: In one of the books, he is obligated to hang someone for disobeying an order.

235
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:13,120
Rym: The order was that he was in the Marine band and he refused to play a B flat because it was the wrong note because the music was written poorly.

236
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,179
Rym: And the order was given by a technically superior officer.

237
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:16,360
Scott: Yep.

238
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,939
Scott: Refusing to play a note, breaking an order, only option, hanging.

239
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,471
Rym: And the funny part is Horatio's like, eh, I got to hang him.

240
00:10:22,511 --> 00:10:24,259
Rym: And his wife is like, what the fuck's wrong with you?

241
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:30,380
Rym: Anyway, so, uh, so back at the hospital, I was kind of like a ship's captain at this point.

242
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,419
Rym: So they'd send me off like whatever, there was something weird going on.

243
00:10:34,461 --> 00:10:39,520
Rym: They'd send me off like, all right, Brandon, you know, cause they didn't, I, that job didn't know my name was Rym.

244
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,400
Rym: Cause they, they didn't deserve to know my real life.

245
00:10:42,382 --> 00:10:43,652
Scott: But your real name is Brandon.

246
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:44,539
Scott: Rym is the fake name.

247
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:53,660
Rym: The thing is my, my, my quote unquote fake name is used by more people, both that I know and that know me than my quote unquote real name.

248
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,440
Scott: Why don't you just then go to the judge and say, change my name?

249
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,659
Rym: Actually, I looked into it and the only reason I haven't is that it's a giant pain in the ass.

250
00:11:01,021 --> 00:11:01,765
Scott: It's not that hard.

251
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:04,120
Scott: You just have to go get a new ID at the DMV.

252
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,260
Rym: No, it's a giant pain in the, I don't think you understand the pain in the ass it is to actually change your name.

253
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,450
Scott: It can't be that hard.

254
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:11,400
Scott: People do it all the time.

255
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,405
Rym: No, no, no, they don't.

256
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:15,260
Rym: And two, when you do, most people who do it are kind of poor.

257
00:11:15,981 --> 00:11:25,208
Rym: If you have a bunch of credit cards and a bunch of investments and all this kind of, you know, economic and all these things around you, they all have to be changed.

258
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:27,840
Rym: Most people don't have straightforward policies.

259
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,746
Rym: Your mail gets fucked up forever.

260
00:11:29,947 --> 00:11:33,060
Rym: Your credit rating gets fucked up until you deal with it at every agency.

261
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,939
Rym: It's this gigantic snafu.

262
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,115
Scott: You just call every single place and say I changed my name.

263
00:11:38,457 --> 00:11:39,100
Scott: I changed my name.

264
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,920
Rym: I did the research and all the research indicates that it's such a pain in the ass.

265
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,120
Rym: And half the time people just, a lot of like people who suck just don't have the capability to deal with your name change.

266
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:55,820
Scott: I can't imagine being, I mean, if it happened to me or if I want to change my name to Joe, I say go get a DMV.

267
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,640
Scott: I got to call my credit card company and the bank and my job and the post office.

268
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,611
Rym: Yes, I have to call all my credit card companies.

269
00:12:03,631 --> 00:12:05,000
Rym: I also have to deal with my health insurance.

270
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:06,569
Rym: I have to deal with my investments.

271
00:12:07,475 --> 00:12:08,259
Rym: There's a lot to it.

272
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,540
Scott: I would just tell my job and the HR person would take care of it.

273
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,669
Rym: No, usually they won't.

274
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,598
Rym: And there's a lot to it.

275
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:13,700
Scott: Oh, they will.

276
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,793
Rym: Also, you've got to make sure your medical records get transferred right.

277
00:12:16,893 --> 00:12:18,340
Scott: Old medical records might just disappear.

278
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,483
Scott: You know what?

279
00:12:19,985 --> 00:12:25,300
Scott: If they don't do it, I could just quit, go get a new job and fill out all the new job paperwork with my new name.

280
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,750
Rym: Regardless, I don't know why you're arguing.

281
00:12:28,574 --> 00:12:29,920
Rym: Apparently it's a giant pain in the ass.

282
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:35,778
Rym: Plus, in most jurisdictions you actually have to go before a judge and prove a valid reason for changing your name.

283
00:12:35,818 --> 00:12:36,500
Rym: They can just say no.

284
00:12:36,741 --> 00:12:37,198
Scott: That'd be fun.

285
00:12:38,102 --> 00:12:38,940
Rym: Usually it's not.

286
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:39,676
Scott: Why not?

287
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:42,719
Rym: From what I read, it's not because the judges don't care.

288
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:44,979
Scott: Judges are cool.

289
00:12:45,702 --> 00:12:46,060
Rym: Sometimes.

290
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,530
Scott: I'm just going to be friendly with the judge.

291
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:48,960
Scott: Be like, what's up judge?

292
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,531
Rym: Anyway, so they'd send me off and they'd be like, all right, drive to this hospital.

293
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:56,760
Rym: It's like 20 miles away or 30 miles away, like down somewhere weird.

294
00:12:57,162 --> 00:12:58,413
Rym: Oh, go to white planes.

295
00:12:58,433 --> 00:12:59,140
Rym: There's this hospital.

296
00:12:59,220 --> 00:12:59,800
Rym: With the wigs and the robes.

297
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,570
Rym: We don't know what's going on.

298
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,280
Rym: Go figure out where our switches went.

299
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,394
Rym: So I'd go out there and they basically say, report back to us in a week.

300
00:13:10,176 --> 00:13:11,680
Rym: And that was the extent of my orders.

301
00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:19,920
Rym: So I'd go and I'd resolve the problem immediately or I'd find out what the problem was and I'd report back and I'd be like, here's the problem.

302
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,857
Rym: What do you want me to do?

303
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,699
Rym: And they'd say, hang on, we'll figure out what we want you to do.

304
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:28,060
Rym: And then a week would go by and every day I'd doodlefully say, what do you want me to do?

305
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,860
Rym: And they'd say, I don't know, go to the hospital and wait.

306
00:13:30,741 --> 00:13:33,980
Rym: And as I learned, they would never tell me what to do after I got to the hospital.

307
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:37,259
Rym: And eventually if I kept asking, they'd say, oh, it's like five, go home.

308
00:13:38,161 --> 00:13:39,145
Rym: So I asked what to do.

309
00:13:39,225 --> 00:13:39,907
Rym: They'd say, wait.

310
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,240
Rym: And then I would just go somewhere and hang out.

311
00:13:43,761 --> 00:13:44,667
Rym: I had my cell phone.

312
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:46,700
Rym: If they actually wanted me to do work, they could call me.

313
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:47,745
Rym: They'd never call me.

314
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,379
Rym: And then I'd go home and then a week would go by without me doing any work.

315
00:13:52,262 --> 00:13:54,799
Rym: That job was awesome, but not in the awesome way.

316
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:55,967
Scott: That was like my job.

317
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:56,691
Scott: Middle of nowhere.

318
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,100
Rym: I go to the middle of nowhere.

319
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,900
Rym: You'd have to drive to that office where there was no one and do nothing and then drive home.

320
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,400
Scott: Well, there was technically a work I was supposed to be doing.

321
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,660
Scott: They were like, they wanted me to basically make a new version of this existing application.

322
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,061
Scott: Right.

323
00:14:09,403 --> 00:14:13,840
Scott: And I'm like, OK, what exactly do you want me to do differently?

324
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,320
Scott: Like, what are the specifications for this remake of this project?

325
00:14:17,562 --> 00:14:20,280
Scott: You know, and they were like, all right, we'll have a meeting about that.

326
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,063
Scott: I'm like, OK.

327
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:27,859
Scott: Occasionally the project I had already completed needed a little bit of maintenance, but that was like once every couple of weeks, a tiny bit of work.

328
00:14:28,421 --> 00:14:31,312
Scott: So it was mostly just being like, hey, are we going to discuss?

329
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:33,420
Scott: And someone's like, oh, well, you can at least do this part.

330
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,547
Scott: We don't need to discuss that.

331
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:35,371
Scott: I'm like, OK.

332
00:14:35,935 --> 00:14:36,820
Scott: I never did that part.

333
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,043
Scott: No one noticed.

334
00:14:38,304 --> 00:14:39,208
Scott: No one talked to me.

335
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:40,473
Scott: No one cared.

336
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:42,019
Scott: No one said anything to me.

337
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:44,332
Scott: No one checked to see what work I was doing.

338
00:14:44,373 --> 00:14:45,540
Scott: No one checked on the progress.

339
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,932
Scott: No one noticed this meeting wasn't happening.

340
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:52,079
Scott: Apparently they wanted it done, but they didn't want it done badly enough to actually pay attention to me.

341
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,520
Scott: If I hadn't quit, I probably could have had that middle of nowhere job until now.

342
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,745
Scott: Still just doing nothing.

343
00:14:57,006 --> 00:15:00,580
Scott: And I probably wouldn't have done any more work now than was completed then.

344
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:02,629
Rym: Didn't you bring your DDR pad out there?

345
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:03,614
Rym: Oh, I did.

346
00:15:03,634 --> 00:15:04,960
Scott: I had my DDR pad out there.

347
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,291
Scott: And I would just play step mania while instead of working.

348
00:15:08,652 --> 00:15:09,796
Rym: Man, that's a good life.

349
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:11,040
Rym: to a point.

350
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,131
Scott: It was OK until I went insane for me in the middle of nowhere.

351
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:16,460
Rym: See, I don't know if I had a job like that.

352
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:21,780
Rym: I would consider it a month or two worth of getting everything I needed to get done, done in my life.

353
00:15:22,141 --> 00:15:30,080
Scott: And that's the problem is that I, you know, while I was working in the middle of nowhere, I realized too late that I could have just not gone to the middle of nowhere and just stayed home.

354
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,380
Rym: I kept saying every day, I was like, why don't you just get another job?

355
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:35,956
Scott: Because it was just like, you know, it's sort of like that, eh.

356
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,072
Rym: And you know what, even better, just get another job.

357
00:15:39,434 --> 00:15:40,420
Rym: Don't even say anything.

358
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,388
Rym: Just see how long they keep paying you.

359
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:45,240
Scott: Yeah, but then there could have been some legal problems later.

360
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,425
Rym: There are ways around that.

361
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:47,793
Scott: I don't know about that.

362
00:15:48,276 --> 00:15:49,020
Rym: I wouldn't have worried.

363
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:50,764
Scott: That's the problem.

364
00:15:50,804 --> 00:15:59,320
Scott: is I worried just a little too much about, you know, cause I kept the CEO of the company lived like around the corner and sometimes he'd drop in like maybe once a month.

365
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,720
Rym: And if he dropped in and you weren't there, he'd probably say, where were you?

366
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,313
Rym: And he'd be like, eh, I was going out to lunch.

367
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,700
Rym: I had a flat tire and I had to deal with it.

368
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,386
Rym: There's no work to do.

369
00:16:07,406 --> 00:16:08,598
Rym: So I didn't bother calling anyone.

370
00:16:09,623 --> 00:16:11,278
Rym: And then I'd just show up for the next couple of weeks.

371
00:16:12,322 --> 00:16:12,746
Scott: Yeah.

372
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,573
Scott: Yeah.

373
00:16:14,017 --> 00:16:14,280
Rym: Oh, well.

374
00:16:14,621 --> 00:16:17,220
Rym: Or you put a cardboard cutout of yourself in the distance.

375
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,359
Rym: Like if there's a glass door in the entrance and break the door so it won't open, like his card won't work.

376
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,111
Scott: And it was, it was a bad time.

377
00:16:24,211 --> 00:16:25,520
Scott: I should have, I really regret.

378
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,620
Scott: I could have done a lot of things in that time that I didn't do, but I would have like gone on vacation.

379
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,402
Rym: Seriously.

380
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:34,376
Scott: I played a lot of video games and I would have made a blog.

381
00:16:34,396 --> 00:16:35,500
Scott: I listen to a lot of podcasts.

382
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:37,084
Rym: You know what you do?

383
00:16:37,144 --> 00:16:41,000
Rym: It's like that comic, you damn kid where it's like, so is he going to work?

384
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,225
Rym: He's got a new job.

385
00:16:42,245 --> 00:16:44,780
Rym: Like, yeah, the over under is five days before he gets fired.

386
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:51,140
Rym: What you could have done is made a blog called my boss doesn't know I'm not working and doesn't seem to care.

387
00:16:51,622 --> 00:16:54,740
Rym: And have bets on when he finds the blog and what he does when he finds it.

388
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,576
Scott: See, I'm a lot smarter now than I was then.

389
00:16:58,621 --> 00:17:03,980
Scott: So it's, you know, back then my best idea was I'll play step mania in the office and say I'm exercising.

390
00:17:05,161 --> 00:17:09,680
Rym: If they, you know, that's like the plan of I have found a soda machine that gives free soda.

391
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,479
Rym: I'm going to get one free soda and then never come back and laugh about it for a week.

392
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,060
Scott: Yes.

393
00:17:14,685 --> 00:17:17,479
Rym: As opposed to I'm going to make a blog about this soda machine.

394
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:18,122
Rym: Yep.

395
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:23,140
Rym: Anyway, I got one hell of a news here, so let's just get any news.

396
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:27,920
Scott: Oh, he's not a feel like it because I got home late and at work I was actually working.

397
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,370
Rym: It's GeekNights Thursdays, the lounge.

398
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,374
Rym: We can do whatever we want.

399
00:17:31,435 --> 00:17:32,259
Rym: There's no such thing as.

400
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,819
Scott: Can we just end the show so I can, you know, go eat and go to bed.

401
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,500
Rym: So I want to talk about this because this is one of those crazy things.

402
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:44,640
Rym: Like what I heard in the news a while, you know, way back that riser as in the guy who made riser.

403
00:17:45,803 --> 00:17:46,083
Rym: Yes.

404
00:17:48,188 --> 00:17:53,240
Rym: He is charged with murdering his wife in this crazy elaborate scheme is just this crazy court case.

405
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:59,400
Rym: And then the news much later found guilty much later told everyone what he did with the body.

406
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:00,442
Scott: Yeah.

407
00:18:00,522 --> 00:18:06,040
Scott: It was like when he was just in the first part of that trial where he was just crazy and weird.

408
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:12,760
Scott: It was like, well, there's a lot of circumstantial evidence and anecdotal evidence and character evidence that he probably did it.

409
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,233
Scott: But there's all this weirdness going on and we can't.

410
00:18:15,253 --> 00:18:16,420
Scott: we don't really know he did it.

411
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,183
Scott: There's no proof.

412
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:18,630
Scott: And there was definitely reasonable doubt.

413
00:18:18,671 --> 00:18:20,640
Scott: But he was found guilty because he was crazy.

414
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:25,120
Scott: And, you know, the jury convicted him because he was a nut job and he didn't know when to keep his mouth shut.

415
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:28,191
Scott: And then he's like, oh, by the way, the body's here.

416
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,297
Scott: So it's like, oh, you did do it.

417
00:18:29,618 --> 00:18:29,940
Scott: Genius.

418
00:18:30,341 --> 00:18:33,274
Rym: So this is that times a little bit.

419
00:18:33,294 --> 00:18:34,660
Scott: How could it be times a little bit?

420
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,587
Scott: OK, I was like, how could it be more than that?

421
00:18:36,627 --> 00:18:39,960
Rym: It's on a similar level of just you read the news and go, what?

422
00:18:40,481 --> 00:18:41,384
Rym: Is that a joke?

423
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:42,167
Rym: All right.

424
00:18:42,267 --> 00:18:43,069
Rym: Oh, I guess it isn't.

425
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,480
Rym: So the spam king, Edward Eddy Davidson.

426
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,229
Scott: I never heard him, but I've heard of many spam kings.

427
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:52,080
Scott: Many people have been called this guy was the spam king.

428
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,366
Rym: There were articles about him forever.

429
00:18:53,386 --> 00:18:56,160
Rym: He finally went to jail in April for spamming.

430
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:56,541
Scott: Really?

431
00:18:56,561 --> 00:19:01,479
Scott: I thought they just finally did jail for having them read the news.

432
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,528
Scott: There's that can spam act, but it's so it's so weak.

433
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:05,351
Rym: All right.

434
00:19:05,652 --> 00:19:08,060
Rym: This guy was the spam king.

435
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:08,562
Rym: All right.

436
00:19:08,863 --> 00:19:11,293
Rym: He was known as the spam king, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

437
00:19:11,936 --> 00:19:13,020
Rym: He was sent to jail.

438
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,299
Rym: Now, when I say jail, basically he was sent to the most minimum security facility there is.

439
00:19:18,701 --> 00:19:21,689
Scott: So it was this like the lock up in the police station.

440
00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:25,500
Scott: or was this actually a county jail or prison, not jail?

441
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:30,780
Rym: Oh, so he was sent to a federal prison camp, a federal prison, which, yes, it was a federal law.

442
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:42,000
Rym: Federal prison camps are basically take cool hand Luke without the psychological torture, without the dying and without the hard labor.

443
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,825
Rym: It's basically summer camp.

444
00:19:44,428 --> 00:19:44,870
Scott: Really?

445
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:45,291
Scott: Yes.

446
00:19:45,612 --> 00:19:47,460
Scott: Man, I should become the spam king.

447
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:53,260
Rym: They make you do menial work for nearby prisons that are more security.

448
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,230
Scott: Like what kind of menial work do you do?

449
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:56,560
Rym: Like, you know, I don't know.

450
00:19:57,343 --> 00:19:59,653
Rym: But basically it's like summer camp.

451
00:19:59,673 --> 00:20:01,140
Rym: There's almost no guards.

452
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,279
Rym: And he was only supposed to be there for like twenty one months.

453
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:10,160
Scott: Twenty one months is a long time, but it's not longer than I was in the middle of nowhere, which is basically the same thing.

454
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,759
Rym: They also made him give up all the gold coins that he bought to hide his money.

455
00:20:15,221 --> 00:20:19,179
Rym: They didn't pay a seven hundred and fourteen thousand dollar restitution to the IRS.

456
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,166
Scott: Here's a funny side story, right?

457
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:24,760
Scott: I was talking with a coworker like a week or two ago.

458
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,061
Scott: Right.

459
00:20:25,161 --> 00:20:30,480
Scott: And he mentioned, you know, I was talking about PayPal and some other stuff and a guy getting screwed on eBay and whatnot.

460
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:37,900
Scott: And he's like, yeah, once I paid for something with e-gold and e-gold as a Web site, e-gold is a Web site that's sort of like PayPal.

461
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:44,300
Scott: But the way it works is you give them money, then they give you you know, they that they have gold.

462
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,060
Scott: They actually have gold that is represented by your money.

463
00:20:47,422 --> 00:20:50,739
Rym: Well, and then they give you a picture of your goal.

464
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:50,980
Scott: Right.

465
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,430
Scott: And then they give you know, I guess they don't physically do it.

466
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,820
Scott: But, you know, financially speaking, you're buying gold.

467
00:20:58,121 --> 00:21:06,060
Scott: Then there by giving them cash, then they transfer the ownership of that gold to someone else who then can turn it into cash if they want to.

468
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:17,300
Scott: So you are basically buying something with gold, which is really good for the person on the other end of the line who wants to be paid in gold rather than paid in whatever currency you happen to use.

469
00:21:18,102 --> 00:21:25,100
Scott: Of course, recently, this is funny because he talked about using e-gold years and years ago and I'd never heard of it before.

470
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:31,859
Scott: But just like a few days ago, there was a story on the Internet's e-gold mad money laundering going on.

471
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:33,726
Scott: Ah, big surprise.

472
00:21:33,746 --> 00:21:37,359
Scott: Big surprise is money laundering with the with the gold transactions.

473
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,323
Rym: I heard something else.

474
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:42,420
Rym: So Penn Jillette was walking around and so he said something that offended someone.

475
00:21:42,821 --> 00:21:54,580
Scott: Guess I would never would have thought that these instant gold transfers a lot of PayPal type set up our money laundering heaven.

476
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,526
Rym: So the spam king, his wife, visited him in prison.

477
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:03,236
Scott: She's allowed to do and he didn't do the visiting with the wall on the phone.

478
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:04,859
Rym: that much time left to go.

479
00:22:05,861 --> 00:22:07,065
Rym: Well, it's minimum security.

480
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,235
Scott: So I got to access the park bench out in the grass, something like that.

481
00:22:10,255 --> 00:22:10,756
Rym: All right.

482
00:22:11,198 --> 00:22:11,820
Scott: The fence around it.

483
00:22:12,322 --> 00:22:15,760
Rym: So he forces her to take him back to the car and he totally escapes.

484
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,020
Scott: OK.

485
00:22:17,362 --> 00:22:21,900
Rym: Thus turning his 21 month prison sentence into, well, you're fucked now.

486
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,125
Rym: So he gets away.

487
00:22:24,406 --> 00:22:26,095
Rym: He escapes from the federal prison.

488
00:22:26,115 --> 00:22:27,160
Rym: He's at large.

489
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,859
Scott: All he did was walk to a car, get in and drive real fast.

490
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,041
Rym: Yes.

491
00:22:31,062 --> 00:22:31,758
Rym: They didn't chase him?

492
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,040
Rym: He went home to his house, apparently got a change of clothes and then booked.

493
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,726
Scott: How did they not go to?

494
00:22:36,746 --> 00:22:39,140
Scott: why did they go to his house and wait for him there?

495
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,271
Rym: Because they did because he went right away.

496
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:42,940
Rym: It's like he went straight to his house and got away.

497
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,038
Scott: He must have lived really close.

498
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,333
Rym: Well, they couldn't drive there faster and they didn't know.

499
00:22:46,354 --> 00:22:47,220
Rym: he broke out right away.

500
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:49,559
Rym: But, quote, he jumped in the car with his wife.

501
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,240
Rym: They when they were leaving, he forced her into the car, brought them home and left after a change of clothes.

502
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,859
Rym: He is still at large.

503
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:58,661
Scott: All right.

504
00:22:58,681 --> 00:23:09,680
Scott: Well, you see, now his options are pretty rough because it's like he's got to get a hide somewhere, which, you know, too many places to hide, considering he had gold coins and all this money.

505
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,466
Rym: I'm sure there was more money hidden.

506
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,660
Rym: I'm sure he retrieved that money, perhaps, perhaps.

507
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,557
Scott: But I mean, it can't really cross a border to get away.

508
00:23:18,577 --> 00:23:19,100
Rym: Yes, it can.

509
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,200
Rym: Depends if he makes it to the Mexican border, the Canadian border, you can totally just go over.

510
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,798
Scott: Where is he going to go over where there aren't people guarding?

511
00:23:27,802 --> 00:23:29,620
Rym: You ever been to the Canadian border?

512
00:23:30,101 --> 00:23:32,333
Rym: There are a lot of places where you can just walk across.

513
00:23:32,353 --> 00:23:33,560
Rym: There's no roads, no nothing.

514
00:23:35,048 --> 00:23:35,699
Scott: Same with Mexico.

515
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,829
Scott: All right, so now he's in Canada.

516
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:37,980
Scott: What's he going to do in Canada?

517
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,140
Rym: Use his money, find some mafia, get a fake name, live a life of luxury.

518
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:45,740
Rym: Possible, possible, but it's still difficult.

519
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,640
Rym: So, so, so, so, so.

520
00:23:47,101 --> 00:23:48,187
Rym: So what do you think happened?

521
00:23:48,207 --> 00:23:50,760
Rym: Because actually there was a fairly speedy update.

522
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,007
Rym: In fact, it was a recent update.

523
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:56,740
Rym: I read this immediately on FARC because I was home, I was working on stuff.

524
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,320
Rym: Scott wasn't home, so we're not doing the show.

525
00:23:59,223 --> 00:24:01,119
Rym: I see news that I did not believe.

526
00:24:01,201 --> 00:24:01,838
Scott: All right.

527
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,704
Rym: So, uh, what can possibly be?

528
00:24:05,804 --> 00:24:13,420
Rym: AK the spam king who reportedly forced his wife to help him escape from a Colorado prison on Sunday has killed himself, a woman and a toddler.

529
00:24:14,547 --> 00:24:14,796
Scott: What?

530
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:15,573
Rym: Yes.

531
00:24:16,382 --> 00:24:19,620
Rym: Earlier Tuesday, Colorado affiliate, nine blah, blah, blah.

532
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:25,060
Rym: News reported that three people have been found dead at an apparent murder suicide in the area.

533
00:24:26,241 --> 00:24:36,400
Rym: He didn't live at this house apparently, but as far as they can tell, he shot himself and his wife and a toddler, but there was another child in the car who he did not shoot in his fine.

534
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:42,860
Rym: He also shot a young girl who survived and was being questioned by police at the time of this press release.

535
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,427
Scott: Wait, it's the same guy.

536
00:24:44,447 --> 00:24:46,080
Scott: So he escaped from prison to kill people.

537
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,960
Rym: And then he disappeared for a while and they found him and a bunch of people dead and it looks like he shot them and himself.

538
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,960
Scott: He was prob of my guess based on common sense.

539
00:24:54,264 --> 00:24:55,259
Scott: I have my own guess.

540
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:02,560
Scott: My guess is that he was somehow, you know, trying to, you know, hide in these people's house or forcing them to help him hide or something like that.

541
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,978
Scott: And of course it didn't turn out well and he gave up.

542
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:12,640
Rym: Well, my belief is that the wife or someone is trying to talk him down with, look, you didn't have that long to go at summer camp.

543
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,060
Rym: Now you're going to go to a real jail and it's going to suck and you're going to be there forever.

544
00:25:17,826 --> 00:25:18,500
Scott: If you get caught.

545
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,900
Scott: I mean, if he was, he wasn't caught yet until he did the killing.

546
00:25:22,383 --> 00:25:25,160
Rym: But my imagination is you didn't think you clever plan through.

547
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,139
Rym: You're going to get caught if you turn yourself in now and just let us go.

548
00:25:29,683 --> 00:25:30,878
Rym: This is probably going to be OK.

549
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,656
Scott: Here's a here's a here's another guess.

550
00:25:32,757 --> 00:25:32,960
Scott: Right.

551
00:25:33,341 --> 00:25:34,292
Scott: OK, so he's out.

552
00:25:34,838 --> 00:25:35,020
Scott: Right.

553
00:25:35,121 --> 00:25:35,868
Scott: And they haven't.

554
00:25:35,888 --> 00:25:37,180
Scott: they're not on his tail at all.

555
00:25:37,301 --> 00:25:37,442
Scott: Right.

556
00:25:37,482 --> 00:25:39,760
Scott: They can't really find him because he had a good job of hiding.

557
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:42,660
Scott: But he's real paranoid now.

558
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,557
Scott: Super paranoid.

559
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:50,920
Scott: So he's like, you know, forcing the people, his wife and the other people near to him, you know, to like not do anything and such and such.

560
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:59,780
Scott: And making life generally miserable and the paranoia of, you know, be watching out and not doing anything because it might get you caught and not knowing what will get you caught.

561
00:25:59,901 --> 00:26:03,340
Scott: And such and such eventually drives him nuts over the days.

562
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,299
Scott: And then he's nuts.

563
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,920
Scott: And then, of course, killing people.

564
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,540
Rym: There are reports that he was kind of paranoid and weird before all this.

565
00:26:10,442 --> 00:26:18,360
Rym: But I think that what the final straw was probably as his wife is saying and explaining all this, he realizes, oh, wait, I totally fucked up.

566
00:26:19,102 --> 00:26:23,640
Rym: And then he panics and just goes crazy and then possible quote when deputies arrived on the scene.

567
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,205
Rym: It is kind of.

568
00:26:24,265 --> 00:26:25,920
Rym: it is actually really sad what happened.

569
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,239
Rym: We thought we did find an adult male deceased by the driver's door of a silver SUV.

570
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,059
Rym: We did find a female adult deceased by the passenger door of the SUV.

571
00:26:34,841 --> 00:26:41,380
Rym: And we did find a seven to eight month old little boy in the backseat who appeared to be uninjured, but was transported by rescue personnel as precaution.

572
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,691
Scott: Where are these their kids?

573
00:26:42,711 --> 00:26:43,620
Scott: Where these kids come from?

574
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:49,180
Rym: Unfortunately, inside the car was also found a little girl who we believe was about three years old and she was deceased.

575
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:54,140
Rym: We did find another victim who was shot and who managed to run to a neighbor's house.

576
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:59,400
Rym: She's a teenage girl transported with a gunshot wound, but she was coherent and talking to rescue personnel.

577
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,979
Rym: Davidson had served less than two months of his 21 month prison sentence when he escaped.

578
00:27:04,841 --> 00:27:05,002
Scott: What?

579
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:07,059
Scott: So whose children were these?

580
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,248
Rym: No one knows.

581
00:27:08,308 --> 00:27:09,580
Rym: This is a developing story.

582
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,740
Scott: No one knows who the children's parents were.

583
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:12,941
Rym: All right.

584
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:14,006
Rym: So the police show up.

585
00:27:14,107 --> 00:27:16,619
Rym: All these people are dead just a little while ago.

586
00:27:17,182 --> 00:27:17,867
Rym: What the shit?

587
00:27:17,988 --> 00:27:19,339
Scott: Hey, kid, who's your mom?

588
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,061
Rym: Yes.

589
00:27:20,142 --> 00:27:21,878
Rym: And they don't tell reporters right away.

590
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,360
Rym: So I'm not going to do the play by play or wait for updates.

591
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,860
Rym: But this got this went kind of crazy out of control in a hurry.

592
00:27:31,622 --> 00:27:32,507
Scott: That is pretty crazy.

593
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:34,860
Scott: I mean, if he escaped from prison, something is not easy to do.

594
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,400
Rym: Even the minimum security prison, even cool hand Luke when they caught him.

595
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:42,620
Rym: I mean, they caught him and they brought him back and they roughed him up a little bit.

596
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,929
Rym: But that's all that happened.

597
00:27:43,949 --> 00:27:45,440
Rym: Even go crazy and kill anyone.

598
00:27:45,981 --> 00:27:47,088
Rym: Yeah, of course.

599
00:27:47,148 --> 00:27:47,350
Rym: Cool.

600
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,235
Rym: And Luke was awesome.

601
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:48,839
Scott: He was cool.

602
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,282
Scott: This guy.

603
00:27:50,624 --> 00:27:51,106
Scott: Not cool.

604
00:27:51,126 --> 00:27:52,533
Scott: This guy's this guy was not.

605
00:27:52,674 --> 00:27:53,880
Scott: is the guy was not cool hand.

606
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,492
Scott: This guy was spam king.

607
00:27:55,552 --> 00:27:56,480
Rym: Gots to be cool.

608
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,420
Scott: I mean, if you're the king of such bad tasting meat, I mean, that's a bad thing to be a king of.

609
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,438
Scott: I'd rather I'd rather be a spam popper than a spam game.

610
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,142
Rym: Spam.

611
00:28:04,162 --> 00:28:06,352
Rym: Don't dare conflate spam.

612
00:28:06,372 --> 00:28:07,778
Rym: The meat with spam.

613
00:28:07,818 --> 00:28:08,200
Rym: The spam.

614
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,367
Scott: They both suck equally.

615
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:10,011
Rym: Spam.

616
00:28:10,031 --> 00:28:11,460
Rym: The meat is mighty tasty.

617
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,368
Scott: First of all, it's not meat.

618
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:13,759
Scott: Second of all, it's not tasty.

619
00:28:14,781 --> 00:28:16,550
Scott: Basically, you were false on two counts.

620
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:18,440
Rym: You realize spam is just cured ham.

621
00:28:18,941 --> 00:28:19,526
Scott: It's not ham.

622
00:28:19,546 --> 00:28:19,949
Scott: It's fake.

623
00:28:20,474 --> 00:28:21,200
Rym: It's just cured ham.

624
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,314
Scott: No, it's artificial ham imitation.

625
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:24,220
Rym: What is it, Scott?

626
00:28:24,923 --> 00:28:27,119
Rym: I suggest you go to Wikipedia and look up what spam is.

627
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,185
Scott: Imitation ham.

628
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,459
Rym: I'm going to read an excerpt here.

629
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:37,140
Rym: Spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam.

630
00:28:37,522 --> 00:28:39,619
Rym: Wikipedia's, ah, God, there's a million articles.

631
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:42,320
Scott: What about the spam king?

632
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:48,719
Rym: I, Scott, quote, "Spam luncheon meat is a canned, pre-cooked meat product made by the Hormel Foods

633
00:28:48,739 --> 00:28:49,220
Rym: Corporation.".

634
00:28:50,449 --> 00:28:50,657
Scott: Yeah?

635
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:51,538
Rym: It is meat.

636
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:57,640
Scott: Yeah, maybe technically it's meat, but it is not real meat.

637
00:28:58,222 --> 00:28:59,188
Rym: What do you define real?

638
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:00,900
Rym: That's a no true Scotsman argument.

639
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:02,454
Scott: No, I mean, it could be rats.

640
00:29:02,515 --> 00:29:02,939
Scott: That's meat.

641
00:29:03,664 --> 00:29:04,340
Rym: Yes, it is meat.

642
00:29:04,761 --> 00:29:06,119
Rym: But you can't say it's not meat.

643
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:07,008
Scott: It is not.

644
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:08,138
Scott: It is and it isn't.

645
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,325
Rym: No, it is.

646
00:29:09,467 --> 00:29:10,800
Rym: What is the definition of meat, Scott?

647
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,739
Rym: Don't pull this no true Scotsman bullshit with me.

648
00:29:14,761 --> 00:29:17,273
Rym: You call everyone on no true Scotsman.

649
00:29:17,313 --> 00:29:18,940
Rym: You're not going to get away with that bullshit now.

650
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,699
Scott: Well, you see, the problem is there's multiple definitions of meat, you see.

651
00:29:22,222 --> 00:29:24,820
Scott: The one definition of meat is flesh of animal.

652
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:26,400
Scott: That is the definition of meat.

653
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:31,160
Scott: The other definition of meat is edible flesh of animal, you see.

654
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,080
Scott: And it is definitely not edible.

655
00:29:33,566 --> 00:29:34,840
Rym: Spam is perfectly edible.

656
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,500
Scott: You see, because there's two definitions of edible, you see.

657
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,800
Scott: There's the definition of edible, which is able to be eaten without killing.

658
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,140
Scott: And then there's the other definition of edible, which is good for eating.

659
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:50,814
Rym: No, you see, what you're doing here, Scott, what you're doing is you're taking the no true Scotsman and you're hiding it behind pedantry.

660
00:29:52,482 --> 00:29:53,469
Rym: You're a pedantic.

661
00:29:53,731 --> 00:29:54,980
Rym: no true Scotsman.

662
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,391
Scott: That's fine.

663
00:29:56,451 --> 00:29:57,239
Scott: What's wrong with that?

664
00:29:58,362 --> 00:29:59,059
Scott: Alright, anyway.

665
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:04,380
Scott: I mean, it's the same way that Checkers is a game.

666
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,119
Scott: But on the other hand, it is not a game.

667
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:06,806
Rym: Yes, it is.

668
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,259
Rym: It's a good game, in fact.

669
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,244
Scott: Not that good.

670
00:30:09,506 --> 00:30:11,500
Scott: Well, Checkers is maybe a bad example.

671
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,278
Scott: Perhaps Final Fantasy is a game, but it is not a game.

672
00:30:14,944 --> 00:30:16,340
Rym: No, it's very clearly a game.

673
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:22,320
Scott: Well, it is a game by the definition of a, you know, a thing that you do to entertain yourself.

674
00:30:22,481 --> 00:30:26,480
Scott: As though it's a good game, but it is not a, you know, test of skills.

675
00:30:26,723 --> 00:30:27,879
Scott: It is a test of patience.

676
00:30:35,822 --> 00:30:38,039
Rym: Anyway, things of the day.

677
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,703
Scott: So check this out.

678
00:30:39,823 --> 00:30:44,540
Scott: Back in Rochester, you know, where we went to school, is the place of Kodak.

679
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:48,940
Scott: And, you know, it's Eastman Kodak, so there's a place called the George Eastman House.

680
00:30:49,801 --> 00:30:56,140
Scott: And they have, of course, many old films and photos and things, and it's sort of a museum type of place.

681
00:30:57,203 --> 00:30:59,860
Scott: I could say more about it, but you can find out enough on the internets.

682
00:31:00,543 --> 00:31:04,200
Scott: But what they did is they took a bunch of their wicked old photos.

683
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:11,260
Scott: Like we're talking 19 oh something like early 20th century photography and they've put it on the flicker.

684
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,360
Scott: You can go check it out.

685
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,716
Scott: And I'm looking through it and I'm like, wow, that's cool.

686
00:31:14,756 --> 00:31:15,320
Scott: Wow, that's cool.

687
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,024
Scott: That's cool.

688
00:31:16,065 --> 00:31:17,920
Scott: But then like, hey, that's a famous photo.

689
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,070
Scott: I've seen that before.

690
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,957
Scott: And then now that's cool.

691
00:31:19,977 --> 00:31:20,340
Scott: That's cool.

692
00:31:20,401 --> 00:31:22,280
Scott: Oh, that's another famous photo I've seen before.

693
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,020
Scott: And they're all on the flicker and really high quality.

694
00:31:26,606 --> 00:31:39,399
Scott: Looking at it in many ways, I realized that, you know, even though things nowadays are way better than things were in the early 20th century, there were a few things here and there they had better than we have now.

695
00:31:39,861 --> 00:31:42,960
Scott: Oh, for example, they had houses on trains.

696
00:31:44,324 --> 00:31:44,707
Scott: We didn't have.

697
00:31:44,727 --> 00:31:46,079
Scott: we don't have houses on trains anymore.

698
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,880
Rym: Let's because trains don't go everywhere.

699
00:31:48,301 --> 00:31:50,153
Rym: Instead, Scott, we have Winnebagos.

700
00:31:50,173 --> 00:31:51,240
Rym: We have houses on roads.

701
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,434
Scott: They had blimps.

702
00:31:52,982 --> 00:31:53,345
Scott: We don't know.

703
00:31:53,386 --> 00:31:55,140
Rym: We're coming back, actually, in a big way.

704
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,246
Scott: We don't have blimps, though.

705
00:31:56,287 --> 00:31:56,488
Scott: We have.

706
00:31:56,508 --> 00:31:58,260
Scott: we have the MetLife blimp, which doesn't count.

707
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,460
Rym: Actually, cargo blimps are coming back in a big way.

708
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,549
Scott: We'll see about that.

709
00:32:01,569 --> 00:32:02,539
Scott: I still haven't seen one.

710
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,039
Scott: I'll believe it when I see one flying over the house.

711
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,000
Scott: You know, I've seen a picture on the Internet does not count.

712
00:32:08,783 --> 00:32:09,795
Rym: I got more than just that.

713
00:32:09,856 --> 00:32:10,078
Rym: But anyway.

714
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:10,461
Rym: Yeah.

715
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:11,346
Scott: But anyway.

716
00:32:11,527 --> 00:32:11,728
Scott: Yeah.

717
00:32:11,768 --> 00:32:13,920
Scott: So it's it's pretty cool checking this shit out.

718
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:24,826
Scott: And, you know, if you've got, you know, 20 minutes, click and look at old photos and you can see what the world looked like in, you know, the early 20th century, over 100 years ago.

719
00:32:27,814 --> 00:32:31,810
Rym: So in 1985, at the Grammy Awards, a confluence of awesome occurred.

720
00:32:32,091 --> 00:32:36,690
Rym: You know, every now and then, like a bunch of really awesome people get together and do something.

721
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,670
Rym: And then that sort of thing is kind of rare.

722
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:44,010
Rym: Like be like if I don't know, lead singer from the best band in the world and the best writer from the best band.

723
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,490
Rym: It's like the all star game of music.

724
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,190
Scott: The thing is, a lot of times they do that at the Grammy Awards.

725
00:32:49,311 --> 00:32:52,650
Scott: It's like, hey, we'll take two famous people, put them on stage at the same time.

726
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,179
Scott: But then they'll be like a lip sync thing.

727
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,890
Scott: And it's all sort of scripted and blend.

728
00:32:56,110 --> 00:33:00,330
Scott: It's not really as awesome as if they actually rocked out together.

729
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:04,770
Scott: You know, the Grammys is sort of like it's got that the tone of an award show event.

730
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,850
Scott: It doesn't have the tone of like the arena concert of all time.

731
00:33:07,951 --> 00:33:08,635
Scott: Let's get it on.

732
00:33:08,675 --> 00:33:09,219
Scott: Yeah.

733
00:33:09,541 --> 00:33:11,010
Rym: Well, it really depends.

734
00:33:11,191 --> 00:33:12,617
Rym: But this one is pretty cool.

735
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,550
Rym: This is 1985, a musical act at the Grammy Awards.

736
00:33:16,233 --> 00:33:20,470
Rym: And the one thing I want to point out is that 1985 was the year when Cyndi Lauper was still pop.

737
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,269
Scott: Well, I was three years old.

738
00:33:22,611 --> 00:33:24,130
Rym: I think she was just becoming popular.

739
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,388
Scott: You know who I'm talking to, old man.

740
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,290
Rym: The thing is, I actually was a big fan of Cyndi Lauper when I was a kid.

741
00:33:30,273 --> 00:33:31,010
Scott: I didn't know who it was.

742
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,174
Scott: She sang the Goonies song.

743
00:33:32,235 --> 00:33:35,890
Rym: Good enough for you, good enough, it's good enough.

744
00:33:36,355 --> 00:33:37,350
Scott: I don't know who it is still.

745
00:33:38,091 --> 00:33:38,597
Rym: Really?

746
00:33:38,618 --> 00:33:39,469
Scott: The Goonies song.

747
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:44,730
Rym: Anyway, so they got Thomas Dolby.

748
00:33:45,334 --> 00:33:45,999
Scott: I don't know who that is.

749
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,370
Scott: Is he the guy from Dolby Digital?

750
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,410
Rym: No, in fact, he was sued by Dolby Digital for using the name Dolby.

751
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,480
Scott: But is that his real name?

752
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:51,541
Scott: No.

753
00:33:52,871 --> 00:33:53,296
Scott: Oh, OK.

754
00:33:53,317 --> 00:33:54,349
Scott: So then they could sue him.

755
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:55,399
Rym: Herbie Hancock.

756
00:33:55,905 --> 00:33:56,309
Scott: Howard Jones.

757
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,189
Scott: I kind of know who that is.

758
00:33:58,293 --> 00:33:59,809
Rym: Get the hell off my show.

759
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,399
Rym: Howard Jones.

760
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,209
Scott: Don't know who that is.

761
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,301
Rym: And Stevie Wonder.

762
00:34:03,382 --> 00:34:03,968
Scott: I know who that is.

763
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,890
Rym: And in 1985, synthesizers were not like they are today.

764
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:12,889
Rym: So this is a key, taran, vocal, whatever, boxing.

765
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:16,730
Scott: Stevie Wonder is the master of all synthesizers.

766
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:24,050
Rym: Beyond that, Stevie Wonder, I think my favorite thing about him is the way he smiles when a crowd is cheering for him.

767
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:29,150
Rym: He always kind of like rears up and then kind of jives back and forth with this big grin.

768
00:34:29,553 --> 00:34:30,469
Rym: I love Stevie Wonder.

769
00:34:30,851 --> 00:34:31,596
Scott: He's pretty awesome.

770
00:34:31,777 --> 00:34:33,389
Rym: Yeah, this video is pretty cool.

771
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:39,110
Rym: And let me tell you, I love the sound of old synthesizers, even though a lot of people, they sound cheesy.

772
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:42,650
Scott: It depends on how they're being used and such.

773
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:47,710
Rym: Well, 80s synthesizers sound cheesy partly because of the way they were used.

774
00:34:48,371 --> 00:34:52,929
Rym: And as a result, when you hear the sounds they can make, the sounds are automatically associated with cheesiness.

775
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:56,129
Rym: But I think they're pretty cool and I think this is pretty cool.

776
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,910
Scott: I think it really depends with the 80s synthesizers.

777
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:00,649
Scott: They can be cool or uncool.

778
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,469
Rym: So what do you eat for dinner?

779
00:35:06,151 --> 00:35:09,869
Scott: Two chocolate chip cookies and some apple juice.

780
00:35:10,432 --> 00:35:14,090
Rym: Well, I had a bowl of ice cream and four Jamaican beef patty bites.

781
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,169
Scott: Sesame stick.

782
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,089
Rym: Oh, and a handful of sunflower seeds.

783
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,255
Scott: Sesame bread stick.

784
00:35:18,376 --> 00:35:19,060
Scott: Oh, some prunes.

785
00:35:19,422 --> 00:35:20,650
Scott: I finished off the bag of prunes.

786
00:35:21,011 --> 00:35:24,070
Rym: When I came home, I cut up some smoked Gouda and had it with some Malbatos.

787
00:35:24,891 --> 00:35:25,214
Scott: Uh-huh.

788
00:35:25,899 --> 00:35:27,230
Scott: That's not much of a dinner, really.

789
00:35:27,611 --> 00:35:29,923
Scott: I mean, how many food groups did I cover?

790
00:35:30,023 --> 00:35:31,270
Scott: Fruit, fruit and cookie.

791
00:35:32,276 --> 00:35:33,050
Scott: You forgot yellow.

792
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,216
Scott: Oh, and bread.

793
00:35:34,297 --> 00:35:35,990
Scott: So fruit, fruit, cookie, bread.

794
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,528
Scott: I didn't get any vegetable or meat or dairy.

795
00:35:38,891 --> 00:35:41,330
Rym: You're missing yellow and grape drink.

796
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,170
Scott: I really need that meat food group.

797
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,503
Scott: Well, I did have two tiny tacos today.

798
00:35:45,523 --> 00:35:46,730
Scott: That covered my meat, kinda.

799
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,790
Rym: See, at least I have these four Jamaican beef patties that I cooked and the two ought to eat.

800
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:53,290
Rym: So they're sitting on the desk next to the microphone right now.

801
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,690
Scott: I'm not a fan of the Jamaican beef patties.

802
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:55,499
Rym: I don't know why.

803
00:35:55,681 --> 00:35:56,490
Rym: They're pure delicious.

804
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:57,749
Scott: Not really, no.

805
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,730
Rym: Delicious in a flaky golden crust.

806
00:36:00,411 --> 00:36:03,690
Scott: Well, we tried to make those frozen nachos yesterday.

807
00:36:03,972 --> 00:36:04,949
Rym: That was terrible.

808
00:36:05,292 --> 00:36:07,002
Scott: Well, it wasn't terrible.

809
00:36:07,162 --> 00:36:08,450
Scott: It didn't taste bad.

810
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:13,170
Scott: But what it was is the nachi, like the frozen nachi, I boiled them and scooped them out like it said to.

811
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,769
Scott: And they're basically just like tasteless.

812
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,770
Scott: Like it was just tasteless mush ball things.

813
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,890
Rym: Here's what I don't get, right?

814
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,368
Rym: So it seems like a lot of Americans eat.

815
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:26,050
Rym: Like I see so much frozen food and I see people buying so much of it.

816
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,890
Scott: Well, I mean, it's really, really convenient.

817
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:31,470
Scott: Just, you know, take some food, heat it up, eat it.

818
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:32,841
Scott: It doesn't take very long.

819
00:36:32,881 --> 00:36:33,870
Scott: You don't have to do a lot of work.

820
00:36:33,951 --> 00:36:35,029
Scott: You don't make a big mess.

821
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,568
Rym: One, it takes longer than ramen.

822
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:37,777
Scott: It does take longer.

823
00:36:37,818 --> 00:36:39,090
Scott: Oh, man, we should eat ramen instead.

824
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,027
Rym: We ate it all.

825
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:40,612
Scott: Oh.

826
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,689
Rym: All that's left is the... You should have bought more.

827
00:36:42,971 --> 00:36:43,590
Rym: I know, but I didn't.

828
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,490
Scott: Just like I should have bought index cards for our panel.

829
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:47,610
Rym: All that's left is the emergency ramen.

830
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:48,674
Scott: Is it?

831
00:36:48,836 --> 00:36:50,190
Scott: What kind of emergency ramen is it?

832
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:52,050
Scott: Well, which flavor?

833
00:36:52,432 --> 00:36:52,801
Rym: I don't know.

834
00:36:52,883 --> 00:36:53,149
Rym: Chicken?

835
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:54,063
Scott: That's OK.

836
00:36:55,257 --> 00:36:55,426
Scott: Ish.

837
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:56,647
Rym: At least it's not maruchan.

838
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,207
Scott: It's not the ichiban, though, so it's...

839
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:00,930
Rym: Yeah, or the fancy ones.

840
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:04,750
Rym: But I lost my train of thought, which is kind of awesome.

841
00:37:05,334 --> 00:37:06,770
Rym: All right, so the frozen food, right?

842
00:37:08,672 --> 00:37:11,930
Rym: Every time I think, "Oh, let's try one of those frozen meals or frozen dinners,".

843
00:37:12,711 --> 00:37:15,570
Rym: they're so awful that they're not worth the convenience.

844
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:19,470
Rym: I would rather eat nothing or eat garbage than eat those things.

845
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:20,950
Rym: They're so tasteless.

846
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,590
Scott: Not everything in the frozen aisle is bad.

847
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:28,529
Scott: For example, you can get the frozen, like, ora-eyed potato things, especially, like, the onion tater tots.

848
00:37:28,892 --> 00:37:29,469
Scott: Those are good.

849
00:37:29,793 --> 00:37:31,270
Scott: You can also get -- what's the other brand?

850
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:33,023
Scott: The Alexa potato wedges.

851
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:33,729
Scott: Those are good, too.

852
00:37:33,971 --> 00:37:35,070
Rym: Yeah, Jamaican beef patties.

853
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:40,884
Scott: It's mostly frozen potato chip or French fry type things, tater tots, that sort of stuff.

854
00:37:40,904 --> 00:37:41,329
Scott: Those are good.

855
00:37:43,211 --> 00:37:45,870
Scott: Also, a few frozen pizzas are good.

856
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:49,030
Scott: Most of them are bad, but some are good, like those two Leonard's ones.

857
00:37:50,593 --> 00:37:52,790
Scott: I like me an Eggo waffle, but Rym does not.

858
00:37:53,752 --> 00:37:55,450
Scott: But you could make a good frozen waffle.

859
00:37:55,870 --> 00:38:01,130
Rym: See, I guess what I don't get is that in the time it takes to deal with one of those frozen meals.

860
00:38:01,171 --> 00:38:09,209
Rym: that tastes like crap, you could make any kind of egg meal, like, any kind of combination of eggs and butter on a pan.

861
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,050
Scott: Yep, you could definitely make an omelet.

862
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:14,310
Scott: An omelet is just as easy as any, you know, frozen dinner.

863
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:17,190
Scott: The thing is, Rym, is that we don't realize we don't have the microwave.

864
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:20,970
Scott: If we had the microwave, then a lot more of those meals would be available to us.

865
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:21,490
Scott: Have you eaten?

866
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:22,690
Scott: And it would be a lot more convenient.

867
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:25,190
Scott: But they're as disgusting, if not more disgusting.

868
00:38:25,271 --> 00:38:26,150
Rym: Usually more disgusting.

869
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:30,830
Scott: Yes, but the convenience level would be there over the omelet that you currently don't have.

870
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,150
Rym: The thing is, though, it's just as convenient.

871
00:38:32,873 --> 00:38:37,950
Rym: It takes you five minutes to make an omelet, from start to finish, unless you're incompetent.

872
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:41,189
Scott: But it's like you gotta chop the stuff up, and you gotta...

873
00:38:41,331 --> 00:38:41,679
Rym: You know what?

874
00:38:41,822 --> 00:38:42,109
Rym: You know what?

875
00:38:42,511 --> 00:38:45,110
Scott: A microwave dinner, you put it in the microwave, you push a button.

876
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:48,950
Rym: Scrambled eggs require nothing.

877
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:52,689
Scott: You gotta scramble, you gotta pour it into the thing, and you gotta move the spatula around.

878
00:38:53,071 --> 00:38:56,710
Scott: With the microwave dinner, you put it in the thing, you push a button, that's it, you're done.

879
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:58,810
Rym: The thing is, the scrambled eggs taste a thousand times better.

880
00:38:58,951 --> 00:38:59,467
Scott: They sure do.

881
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,990
Scott: The only problem with... No, they taste infinity.

882
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:11,690
Scott: Well, they taste an imaginary number better, because what happens is the TV dinner has a negative taste.

883
00:39:12,332 --> 00:39:22,190
Scott: So if you were to divide the flavor rating, which is a very large positive number of the scrambled egg, by the negative number of the flavor of the TV dinner, you will get an imaginary number.

884
00:39:22,331 --> 00:39:33,010
Rym: I guess this is kind of, in our eyes, an indictment of the people who eat these frozen dinners on a regular basis, because they're so bad that I would rather not eat dinner than eat them.

885
00:39:33,573 --> 00:39:40,310
Rym: And the fact that there's so many of them, and I see people buying them all the time, we wonder why people are fat in this country if you're that lazy.

886
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,469
Scott: Well, it's because they go for the fast food, not for the TV.

887
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,807
Scott: The TV dinner helps, but it's mostly the McDonald's.

888
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:50,210
Scott: But, I mean, there are dinners you can get in a can that are better than the ones that are frozen.

889
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:53,210
Scott: I mean, even like Campbell's soup, it's all right.

890
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,390
Scott: It's not, you know, great, but it's okay.

891
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,710
Scott: Ramen, it's not great, but it's okay.

892
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:01,730
Scott: And you can get good ramen, too, for like a few dollars instead of a ten-cent ramen.

893
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,369
Rym: The thing is, I remember back to college thinking, you know, the quick meals.

894
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,309
Rym: Pretty much, what did we eat?

895
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,189
Rym: We made ramen?

896
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,409
Scott: We didn't get a can of chili in it.

897
00:40:08,772 --> 00:40:09,470
Scott: Not too bad.

898
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,770
Rym: Yeah, of course, chili is also super easy to make.

899
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:16,890
Scott: You can also get like a pre-prepared salad and then put salad dressing on it, and you're good to go.

900
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:17,510
Scott: That's awesome.

901
00:40:17,651 --> 00:40:24,989
Rym: Yeah, our problem is we've been living our college lifestyle again where we basically don't cook a real dinner and then it's late and we're hungry.

902
00:40:25,353 --> 00:40:27,190
Rym: So we eat something convenient and go to sleep.

903
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:30,930
Scott: Yeah, I really, see, this is why I'm really torn about this.

904
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:40,890
Scott: Ideally, what I should be doing with my current, you know, life schedule is eating a humongous lunch and then not eating so much for dinner, but it won't matter because I got my nutrition at lunch.

905
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:47,950
Scott: The thing is, I really don't want to spend money for a big awesome lunch because I save money by making my peanut butter and jelly.

906
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:49,637
Scott: And I'm torn between.

907
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:56,230
Scott: should I continue this trend of not getting proper nutrition and not eating a good enough dinner?

908
00:40:56,351 --> 00:41:01,170
Scott: or even if I do eat enough good, good enough dinner, it's right before I go to bed, which is really not so great.

909
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:04,469
Scott: Eating a whole bunch of food, they go to bed immediately instead of using the food.

910
00:41:05,594 --> 00:41:11,689
Scott: Or should I break the bank and get proper nutrition and just go out and eat awesome lunches every day?

911
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:20,429
Rym: Maybe it's just a factor of making a lot more money and the amount I care about money is getting really not cool because I'm spending money left and right.

912
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:27,610
Rym: But I've got to the point where I will pretty much eat, at least on the days we do the show, a full dinner at lunch and then a light dinner when I get home.

913
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:41,509
Scott: Maybe that's what I could do, is on the days when we're doing a show, I will go out and get an awesome lunch, but on the days when we're not doing a show, I'll just eat my peanut butter and jelly, still save some monies, and then we'll have to cook, though.

914
00:41:41,731 --> 00:41:48,090
Rym: Maybe because I'm running every day and all this stuff now, literally, I could eat a double cheeseburger, a real one.

915
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:48,810
Rym: I'll go to Good Burger.

916
00:41:49,471 --> 00:41:52,970
Rym: I'll eat a double cheeseburger, onion rings, fries, and a root beer float.

917
00:41:53,251 --> 00:41:55,630
Scott: Even in high school, I could never eat a double cheeseburger.

918
00:41:55,851 --> 00:41:57,061
Scott: I would eat a single hamburger.

919
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:07,050
Rym: The thing is, a double cheeseburger at the Good Burger isn't like a McDonald's with all the... It's basically two entire hamburgers, like real ones.

920
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:16,630
Scott: That's the thing, for some reason I can eat two hamburgers separate, but the double hamburger, where it's two meats on the same bun, that's just inedible for some reason.

921
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:22,604
Rym: A few days ago, I was like, "All right, I'm really hungry because I've been running and all this, and I'm going to run when I get home, so I'm going to eat a big

922
00:42:22,645 --> 00:42:22,867
Rym: lunch.".

923
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:30,090
Rym: First, for breakfast, I had a sausage, egg, and cheese on a bagel, and an orange juice, and a Red Bull, and all that business.

924
00:42:30,791 --> 00:42:36,750
Scott: Actually, I was sort of helping out by eating breakfast again, but we ran out of English muffins, and that was my go-to breakfast.

925
00:42:37,273 --> 00:42:38,470
Rym: I buy my breakfast every day.

926
00:42:38,732 --> 00:42:41,530
Rym: Sausage, egg, and cheese, with a Red Bull and orange juice for breakfast.

927
00:42:42,031 --> 00:42:42,549
Scott: That's great.

928
00:42:42,991 --> 00:42:48,170
Rym: Then, for lunch, I went to the Good Burger, and I got a double cheeseburger, onion rings, and a root beer float.

929
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:48,829
Scott: And a Red Bull.

930
00:42:49,676 --> 00:42:50,510
Rym: No, only one Red Bull.

931
00:42:50,951 --> 00:42:54,670
Rym: I figured I'd be good between the two, but then I was still hungry.

932
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:58,490
Rym: Crazy hungry, all day, despite I was full when I ate that.

933
00:42:59,111 --> 00:43:00,609
Rym: Then a few hours later, I was hungry again.

934
00:43:01,031 --> 00:43:03,849
Rym: I went out, got some Beard Pappas, and I ate those.

935
00:43:04,711 --> 00:43:06,070
Rym: Then I was hungry again immediately after.

936
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:10,149
Rym: So I came home, and I made a big dinner, and I ate it.

937
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:15,010
Rym: And then I went out running, and I did all my stuff, and then Scott came home, and we watched something.

938
00:43:15,651 --> 00:43:18,349
Rym: And I was still hungry, so I made a fried egg before I went to bed.

939
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:25,830
Scott: Yeah, it's just that I'm getting home just an hour later, which is still enough time to do the show, and it's not too bad, really.

940
00:43:26,752 --> 00:43:30,470
Scott: But it's sort of that hour was the hour we used to cook dinner.

941
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,790
Scott: And now it's like, get home, we do the show.

942
00:43:32,891 --> 00:43:34,670
Scott: By the time the show is over, it's nine o'clock.

943
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,110
Scott: I'm going to eat dinner at nine o'clock.

944
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:36,910
Scott: That's already crazy.

945
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:38,970
Scott: I mean, I get home at like seven something.

946
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,230
Scott: I'd like to eat dinner at five, six.

947
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:42,710
Scott: I wouldn't want to eat dinner at seven.

948
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:45,370
Scott: It's really, it's not good at all.

949
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:49,449
Scott: It's like the time when dinner should be eaten is the time when I'm on the train.

950
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:52,670
Scott: And it's unpleasant, to say the least.

951
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:54,550
Rym: So at least, I mean, on the days we don't do the show.

952
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:56,110
Scott: And that's the time I want to be eating dinner.

953
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:59,370
Scott: So the time when I should be cooking dinner is like the last hour I'm at work.

954
00:44:00,231 --> 00:44:06,510
Rym: See, the way I do it, at least on the days we don't do the show, I usually come home and I make a dinner that'll be ready right around when Scott and Emily get home.

955
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:10,450
Rym: And that works pretty well, but I can't make dinner all the time.

956
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:16,050
Scott: Before I was coming home late and, you know, I was actually making dinner like once or twice a week.

957
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:19,470
Scott: And, you know, I'd make chicken once or twice a week of different varieties and things.

958
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:25,709
Scott: And I haven't cooked anything in like a couple months and I feel bad about it, but I can't really do anything about it either.

959
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:40,430
Rym: Of course, part of this is we're starting to realize more and more that it almost seems like America, at least outside of like outside of the major cities, outside of major cities, outside of college towns, you know, normal suburban United States, the average town.

960
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:51,190
Rym: It's like there is no way for someone, people like us who are not members of nuclear families and who have jobs to do most of the things that normal people in society are expected to do.

961
00:44:51,610 --> 00:45:01,210
Scott: I mean, the society is really structured in a way to where without a nuclear family kind of situation, things are very can be very inconvenient.

962
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:15,190
Scott: For example, if you had a nuclear family, right, one person goes to work, one person stays home, or maybe one person, you know, even if they commute far away, the other person might work locally, you know, in town somewhere or if they work from home or something.

963
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:26,109
Scott: So if a package comes, the person is home to get someone is home to get the package, or you make so much money, you have like, you know, a nanny or a house cleaner, someone to be home and get the package.

964
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:33,270
Scott: If you want to go eat out, you're home early enough and you can just go somewhere nearby to eat out.

965
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:37,930
Scott: If, you know, your whole house is full of commuters to get home at seven, everything closes.

966
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:39,970
Rym: Well, no, no, that's the thing at least.

967
00:45:40,511 --> 00:45:41,598
Rym: All the restaurants are open.

968
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:43,330
Rym: We can just go to a restaurant and eat out and it's great.

969
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:47,950
Rym: The problem is that does get very expensive eating out at real restaurants every single night.

970
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:50,230
Scott: It also makes you very fat very quickly.

971
00:45:50,631 --> 00:45:51,310
Rym: Not if you're active.

972
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:55,770
Scott: No, but I mean, you got to, you know, eating out at restaurants too much is not so good.

973
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:57,136
Scott: You definitely want to be eating in.

974
00:45:57,297 --> 00:46:00,230
Scott: the food you cook in your house is far better in terms of your health.

975
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:05,450
Rym: Yeah, but then go back to college where I cooked most of my meals, but most of my meals consisted of two to four eggs.

976
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:07,710
Scott: Most of my meals were like a hot dog on a plate.

977
00:46:09,231 --> 00:46:18,210
Rym: I remember we'd have dinners where literally like both our plates would have like some scrambled eggs, some cooked hot dogs and like some bread to use as buns.

978
00:46:18,471 --> 00:46:18,815
Scott: That's the thing.

979
00:46:18,835 --> 00:46:20,070
Scott: It's like I had the best intentions.

980
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:23,230
Scott: When we got to RIT, I brought my parents' old kitchen table.

981
00:46:23,633 --> 00:46:26,270
Scott: I cooked like a big spaghetti and meatball dinner for everyone.

982
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:30,270
Scott: We all, you know, grouped up and, you know, then someone tried to cook a stir fry.

983
00:46:30,973 --> 00:46:32,890
Scott: And then that lasted maybe a couple of weeks.

984
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:40,129
Scott: And before you knew it, we put the kitchen table out, you know, side saying, take this, it's free, because he was just taking up space and we weren't using it.

985
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:44,530
Scott: And the communal cooking real dinners thing totally didn't happen anymore.

986
00:46:44,671 --> 00:46:55,730
Scott: And it was game over, you know, and Emily, when she got out of college and started living in Beacon, you know, I saw my past self in her because she was like, you know, let's cook dinner every night.

987
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:57,669
Scott: And I'm like, yeah, that's what I thought.

988
00:46:58,633 --> 00:47:00,550
Scott: And then, you know, she was like, oh, this sucks.

989
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:02,310
Scott: She was complaining because it wasn't happening.

990
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:06,290
Scott: And then she was just like, yeah, I see why it doesn't happen.

991
00:47:07,016 --> 00:47:07,850
Rym: And it totally sucks.

992
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:11,270
Rym: The thing is, though, she's been having a renaissance of cooking dinner lately.

993
00:47:12,152 --> 00:47:23,050
Rym: And the thing is, the key, the only problem here is that we were doing OK, actually, like before Scott started coming home late, we actually cooked dinner like most five, five nights a week.

994
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:27,570
Scott: At least at least three nights a week, at least three, usually a good four or five nights a week.

995
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:28,272
Rym: And we would cook a real.

996
00:47:28,332 --> 00:47:32,930
Scott: not all of those meals might have been awesome, but they were OK enough.

997
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:34,529
Scott: They were better than hot dog on a plate.

998
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:38,670
Rym: The thing is, Emily is a lot better than us at improvising with, you know, just whatever's laying around.

999
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:43,130
Rym: She made like collard greens and rice and some eggs and some naan.

1000
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,428
Rym: It was super good last night.

1001
00:47:45,111 --> 00:47:48,050
Scott: Of course, I don't like the collard greens, but I love collard greens.

1002
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:48,788
Scott: I'm not a fan.

1003
00:47:49,171 --> 00:47:50,750
Rym: But it was great because she's like, I'm going to go dinner.

1004
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:55,490
Rym: It's like, awesome, because I was basically going to eat the emergency ramen and go to sleep otherwise.

1005
00:47:57,311 --> 00:47:58,409
Rym: So she kind of saved me there.

1006
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:03,429
Rym: But yeah, basically, Scott, you know what it really boils down to is you get home late and that fucks everything up.

1007
00:48:04,872 --> 00:48:05,276
Scott: I don't know.

1008
00:48:05,397 --> 00:48:06,789
Scott: Maybe I'll do something about it.

1009
00:48:07,151 --> 00:48:07,433
Rym: Yeah.

1010
00:48:07,574 --> 00:48:09,209
Rym: At least we can get through Con season first.

1011
00:48:09,751 --> 00:48:09,932
Scott: Yeah.

1012
00:48:10,273 --> 00:48:13,790
Scott: If we see I realize, you know, it would solve everything if we formed a studio.

1013
00:48:14,345 --> 00:48:14,510
Scott: No.

1014
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:16,030
Rym: And lived as a company.

1015
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:16,630
Scott: No.

1016
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:24,930
Scott: If we had a personal chef, we just pay them to come to the house around, you know, five, six o'clock every day, cook a dinner.

1017
00:48:25,373 --> 00:48:26,630
Scott: And they didn't even have to stick around.

1018
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:31,570
Scott: They just could leave it in the fridge or something and, you know, or just keep it hot somewhere where we can just come home and eat it.

1019
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:41,670
Rym: Well, the other thing we could do is I could cook more because I was doing this for a while where I'd cook like Swiss steaks or like a little like a mini pot roast or like chili or a bean soup.

1020
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:49,050
Rym: Things that I can start like I get home from work, I put it all together or a casserole and I set it cooking and then around seven it's done and then we eat it.

1021
00:48:49,472 --> 00:48:51,930
Rym: And then I save the other half of it and just reheat it the next day.

1022
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:52,636
Scott: There is one.

1023
00:48:52,656 --> 00:48:53,950
Scott: There's a guy I work.

1024
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:56,020
Rym: The only reason I'm not doing that is Con season.

1025
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,769
Rym: We're busy doing stuff like every day now.

1026
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:58,151
Scott: Yeah.

1027
00:48:58,171 --> 00:49:01,270
Scott: There's a guy I work with and he still lives with his parents in Jersey.

1028
00:49:01,993 --> 00:49:05,230
Scott: But, you know, he's got they they they all work.

1029
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:09,410
Scott: You know, they're like he has a twin sister who's also working and his parents are working.

1030
00:49:09,551 --> 00:49:12,330
Scott: So there's like there's no one in the house, but, you know, they got to eat dinner.

1031
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:23,590
Scott: So what they do is actually on the weekend, they cook like four or five dinners and then they set them all up in the refrigerator, you know, and then they reheat them throughout the week for dinner.

1032
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:29,467
Scott: So, you know, one person, someone comes home at eleven and someone else comes home at six and someone else comes home at one a.m.

1033
00:49:29,487 --> 00:49:30,410
Scott: because they went out partying.

1034
00:49:30,851 --> 00:49:31,635
Scott: There's something to eat.

1035
00:49:31,675 --> 00:49:34,690
Scott: They can, you know, reheat their portion, a portion of one of the meals.

1036
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:37,178
Scott: And, you know, by the end of the week, all the meals are out.

1037
00:49:37,218 --> 00:49:38,242
Scott: Then they go out to eat.

1038
00:49:38,262 --> 00:49:40,670
Scott: And then on Sunday they cook, you know, five more meals.

1039
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:46,050
Scott: And we could do that, except we use our Sundays because we don't get enough time off work.

1040
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:48,639
Scott: We need that to do stuff like our geeky endeavors.

1041
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:52,030
Scott: They're not so much of the geeky endeavors while they're cooking their meals Sunday.

1042
00:49:52,393 --> 00:49:54,550
Scott: You know, they're just watching a football or something.

1043
00:49:55,412 --> 00:50:01,170
Scott: We can't do that while we're playing a video game or remember the days when we had this house.

1044
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,321
Rym: We were not podcasters.

1045
00:50:03,522 --> 00:50:04,610
Rym: We were just geeks out of college.

1046
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:06,959
Scott: And we watched Netflix every single day.

1047
00:50:07,059 --> 00:50:09,469
Scott: And every weekend we drove up the road to play DDR.

1048
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:17,950
Rym: Of course, the thing is, back then, not only were we not podcasting, no one else lived around, so there was no one else to hang out with.

1049
00:50:19,432 --> 00:50:21,729
Rym: And, like, Scott got out of work earlier and I worked at IBM.

1050
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,230
Scott: I was working in the middle of nowhere.

1051
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:24,950
Rym: Yeah, so he could leave whenever he wanted.

1052
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:27,570
Scott: Actually, for a while I was working in the city and then the middle of nowhere.

1053
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:33,250
Rym: I worked five minutes away from our house at IBM so I could leave whenever I wanted and go in whenever I wanted.

1054
00:50:33,992 --> 00:50:36,488
Rym: So, I mean, I would come home for lunch half the time because it was right here.

1055
00:50:37,692 --> 00:50:39,926
Rym: So we'd come home from work at, like, five.

1056
00:50:39,966 --> 00:50:40,490
Rym: We'd be home.

1057
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:43,890
Rym: We'd watch, like, a Netflix and then a couple episodes of The Simpsons.

1058
00:50:44,352 --> 00:50:47,790
Rym: And then we'd play a board game and then we'd play video games, like, until late.

1059
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:48,837
Scott: And then it'd be like, "What do we do

1060
00:50:48,877 --> 00:50:49,058
Scott: now?"

1061
00:50:49,078 --> 00:50:50,689
Scott: And he'd be sitting around going, "I don't know what to

1062
00:50:50,749 --> 00:50:50,850
Scott: do.".

1063
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:55,630
Scott: And then we'd talk for an hour, which would have been a podcast if we had recorded it, but we just talked.

1064
00:50:55,851 --> 00:50:56,093
Rym: Yup.

1065
00:50:56,294 --> 00:50:58,429
Rym: And then we'd, like, cook a full dinner and then go to bed.

1066
00:50:58,850 --> 00:50:58,918
Scott: Yup.

1067
00:51:00,333 --> 00:51:02,030
Rym: Too bad we do a podcast.

1068
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:03,192
Scott: Too bad.

1069
00:51:03,212 --> 00:51:06,310
Scott: Well, even if we didn't do the podcast, we'd still be screwed in the current situation.

1070
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:14,330
Scott: So at least we're making something, you know, and maybe one day someone will, you know, cook us dinner in exchange for podcasts.

1071
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:16,009
Scott: Maybe we should do that.

1072
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:21,410
Scott: Hey, guys, if you don't come, if someone doesn't come and cook us dinner five nights a week, podcast is over.

1073
00:51:21,837 --> 00:51:22,064
Scott: That's it.

1074
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:28,929
Scott: So if you want this podcast to continue, you should come and move to Beacon and you will get paid ten dollars a day.

1075
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:32,230
Scott: So fifty bucks a week to cook dinners.

1076
00:51:32,891 --> 00:51:36,689
Rym: Well, we could clear out the closet under the stairs, put a little bed in there.

1077
00:51:37,334 --> 00:51:37,821
Rym: That could be it.

1078
00:51:38,591 --> 00:51:41,150
Rym: If you cook us dinner five nights a week, you can live in that closet.

1079
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:42,348
Scott: I think that violates the rents.

1080
00:51:43,055 --> 00:51:43,728
Rym: I'm fine with that.

1081
00:51:44,112 --> 00:51:44,339
Scott: At least.

1082
00:51:44,359 --> 00:51:44,689
Scott: Whatever.

1083
00:51:46,012 --> 00:51:46,558
Rym: All right.

1084
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:47,690
Rym: I think this Thursday is done.

1085
00:51:47,931 --> 00:51:52,270
Scott: It's Thursday is indeed done, but the world sucks for single commuters.

1086
00:51:52,873 --> 00:51:54,570
Scott: We were supposed to live in the city, but we don't.

1087
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:55,488
Scott: So it fucks us.

1088
00:51:55,910 --> 00:52:02,990
Rym: But that's fine, because eventually we'll have our own front row crew studio and office space up here and the mansion on that land we're going to buy.

1089
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:03,867
Scott: Yeah, you wish.

1090
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:04,550
Rym: It's coming.

1091
00:52:05,075 --> 00:52:05,428
Scott: We'll see.

1092
00:52:05,811 --> 00:52:06,297
Rym: Actually called.

1093
00:52:06,337 --> 00:52:07,470
Rym: It looks like that land has sewer.

1094
00:52:08,314 --> 00:52:09,548
Rym: So I'm looking into buying it.

1095
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:10,292
Scott: We should go.

1096
00:52:10,514 --> 00:52:13,150
Scott: We should walk over this weekend and, you know, poke it.

1097
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:14,690
Rym: Yeah, we'll do all the poking.

1098
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:15,788
Scott: I got to take a look at the dirt.

1099
00:52:16,997 --> 00:52:17,529
Rym: It's a good day.

1100
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:18,838
Scott: Yeah, that's how you know.

1101
00:52:18,878 --> 00:52:20,270
Scott: If it's full of rocks, it's not good.

1102
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:21,609
Rym: All right, we're done.

1103
00:52:28,131 --> 00:52:30,210
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1104
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:32,830
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

1105
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:44,710
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com, where you'll find show notes, links, our awesome forum, a link to our Frapper map, and links to all the RSS feeds.

1106
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:50,970
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week, covering four different brands of geekery.

1107
00:52:51,552 --> 00:52:53,179
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

1108
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,570
Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

1109
00:52:56,230 --> 00:53:01,630
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights, and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

1110
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:10,130
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com, or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

1111
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:13,730
Scott: Just click the link that says "Send me an Odeo" on the right side of our website.

1112
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:19,190
Rym: If you like what you hear, you can catch the last 100 episodes in iTunes or in your favorite podcatcher.

1113
00:53:19,451 --> 00:53:22,530
Rym: For the complete archives, visit the website, which has everything.

Scott: This means you can do whatever you want with it, as long as you give us credit, don't make money, and share it in kind.

1116
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:39,950
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1117
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:43,530
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
