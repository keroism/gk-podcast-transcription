Rym: I mean, there's a lot of reasons to like it.

9
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,570
Rym: I mean I went to a place called milk and honey and got a really good bagel this morning.

10
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,542
Scott: But if it was called milk and honey, why did they have bagel?

11
00:00:40,562 --> 00:00:42,430
Scott: shouldn't they have had milk and honey?

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:42,932
Rym: You know what?

13
00:00:43,354 --> 00:00:48,728
Scott: there was neither milk nor honey there what but they had bagels But you couldn't buy milk to wash down your bag.

14
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:51,550
Scott: No Well, the thing is that or did you get your bagel flavored by honey?

15
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:56,328
Rym: They're super kosher and there's even a sign like they won't let you bring in any other food in there.

16
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:56,428
Scott: Okay?

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,773
Scott: It's one of those you places.

18
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,685
Rym: All right, and it was a really good bagels, but I couldn't get any milk.

19
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,095
Scott: Oh They probably had some meats there.

20
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:06,148
Rym: Yes, they had locks and locks doesn't count.

21
00:01:06,168 --> 00:01:06,510
Scott: It's fish.

22
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,122
Rym: They also had kosher sushi and they had much other stuff.

23
00:01:10,243 --> 00:01:11,668
Scott: Anyway, fish doesn't count.

24
00:01:11,748 --> 00:01:12,330
Rym: What about mermaid?

25
00:01:13,393 --> 00:01:14,501
Rym: What what about mermaid?

26
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:17,364
Scott: I Think because mermaid doesn't exist.

27
00:01:17,405 --> 00:01:28,669
Scott: It doesn't matter But if mermaid did exist I'm sure you could go to a rabbi and ask him and I'm pretty sure he might tell you that the bottom half is Okay, and the top half is not okay to eat.

28
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:37,907
Rym: But uh, what I really like is that you know, I lived in Michigan and my commute I guess to high school would be interrupted by occasionally a car accident.

29
00:01:37,947 --> 00:01:42,227
Rym: Maybe a deer Maybe a prayer for pretty much a lot of people.

30
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:56,630
Rym: Yeah, but living here, my commute is being interrupted by the UN General Assembly and motorcades and armed guards and diplomats and bodyguards and Funny people wearing funny outfits from funny countries talking to each other in funny languages.

31
00:01:56,871 --> 00:01:57,393
Scott: I love those.

32
00:01:57,434 --> 00:02:04,664
Rym: those are the best and they always look so happy like every diplomat I've seen For the entire week has looked really really happy.

33
00:02:04,764 --> 00:02:10,749
Rym: and then just I don't know Here's a notice to all you kids out there you ready be a diplomat when you grow up?

00:02:13,298 --> 00:02:15,707
Scott: diplomat is the best job in the world.

36
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:18,970
Rym: Well, it depends I mean depends on why you don't want to be the dwell.

37
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,430
Rym: It depends on where you're the dip like I'm saying do you want to be the diplomat to say the internet?

38
00:02:24,191 --> 00:02:24,893
Scott: No, see what you want to do.

39
00:02:24,934 --> 00:02:26,299
Scott: is you want to study a language.

40
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,250
Scott: that is a language not many people study yet.

41
00:02:29,652 --> 00:02:33,070
Scott: You want it to be a language that is spoken in safe places?

42
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,010
Scott: For example learn Romanian and then you can be the diplomat to Romania.

43
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:38,954
Rym: Oh, that'd be great.

44
00:02:39,235 --> 00:02:48,070
Scott: And it's a pretty sweet job because you can do as you please Travel a lot live in luxury not do much else.

00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:55,530
Rym: Well, you know theoretically deal with foreign policy at a very direct and real and meaningful scale, right?

46
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,243
Scott: If anything that happens between the US and Romania, guess what?

47
00:02:58,565 --> 00:03:05,065
Scott: not much You never know never know I mean, but what was the diplomat to Romania's job?

52
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:17,430
Rym: You see I'm walking toward this training class.

53
00:03:17,491 --> 00:03:33,810
Rym: I'm in training all week So I'm actually going to the city and walk into this other building up at like 45th Street by Times Square Mm-hmm, and I'm trying to walk back home from work today From the training and there's a big motorcade and it's going up 6th Avenue and I pretty much I can't like easily cross it.

54
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:34,974
Rym: Like it just there's trouble.

55
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:39,010
Rym: So I start divert myself a bit, you know anytime there's traffic in the way.

56
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:42,988
Rym: You just walk in the other direction in parallel and then walk and that's the way New York is.

57
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:51,210
Rym: so I'm walking down the street that I haven't walked down in a long time and I Found another good burger and it's closer to my work than the other good burger that I eat at all the time.

58
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,777
Scott: Why didn't you you could use Google Maps?

59
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:53,641
Rym: I never thought to.

60
00:03:53,661 --> 00:03:55,650
Rym: I didn't even know there's more than one good burger.

61
00:03:56,594 --> 00:03:56,895
Scott: You know what.

62
00:03:56,915 --> 00:03:58,802
Scott: there might be non good burger burger place.

63
00:03:58,842 --> 00:03:59,866

Rym: It told me about burger heaven, which is not so great more of a diner Like burger heaven, but they I found a good burger randomly.

67
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:09,606
Scott: and here's something I don't understand.

68
00:04:09,646 --> 00:04:13,041
Scott: right UN headquarters It's pretty much on the east side of the city on the water.

69
00:04:13,161 --> 00:04:15,030
Scott: Yeah, right near the FDR Drive or whatever.

70
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,360
Scott: Yeah, why doesn't those people?

71
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,425
Scott: why do they have motorcades?

72
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:19,469
Scott: Why don't they boat in?

73
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,473
Rym: Because it's all diplomats who are an Boats.

74
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,470
Rym: no, it's got its attaches and diplomats.

75
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,968
Rym: So what they're doing is they're all staying in those luxury hotels like the Algonquin and the.

76
00:04:29,989 --> 00:04:32,097
Rym: you know All the fancy famous old hotels.

77
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:40,586
Rym: I personally am a fan of the Mandarin and the mandarins nice place But they're all the circle the Iroquois the Algonquin, you know right next to the New York Yacht Club.

78
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:47,910
Scott: Yeah that area I know the Mandarin or Oriental hotel in Columbus circles the best hotel in the city as far as I'm concerned.

79
00:04:48,712 --> 00:04:54,099
Rym: Anyway, anyway, oh That's all I gotta say, okay, so I don't know.

80
00:04:54,159 --> 00:05:03,548
Scott: Pete I don't talk about the specifics of my job too much on the show but You know, our company was somewhat recently acquired by another company, but it wasn't like haha.

81
00:05:03,568 --> 00:05:04,250
Scott: We're buying you.

82
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,157
Scott: It was like, you know, it was an arranged deal.

83
00:05:06,498 --> 00:05:08,726
Scott: My company was owned by four partners.

84
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:09,910
Scott: I assume they were equal partners.

85
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,392
Scott: I don't know.

86
00:05:10,412 --> 00:05:12,077
Scott: I don't know business details.

87
00:05:12,118 --> 00:05:15,710
Scott: I just code there and they sold the company to this other company.

88
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:19,530
Scott: So now they're just managers and now the new company is the bosses, right?

89
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:26,134
Scott: Okay, big deal didn't really change my job that much except for Something that happened today.

90
00:05:26,174 --> 00:05:31,370
Scott: You see we used to just you know, and he wanted to buy things specifically in tech, right?

91
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,030
Scott: We had a tech budget and we spent the tech budget, right?

92
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,499
Scott: We would buy a server when he wanted.

93
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:38,130
Scott: you'd buy something else you want, right?

94
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,950
Scott: And we would always get exactly what we asked for one of the new dev server.

95
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:46,188
Scott: We got this Dell like one you rack mount Dealey with like, you know, two CPUs in there.

96
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:46,650
Scott: Very nice.

Scott: We picked it out.

98
00:05:48,035 --> 00:05:49,541
Scott: We customized it at dell.com.

99
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:50,083
Scott: We ordered it.

100
00:05:50,424 --> 00:05:51,528

00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:51,870
Scott: all good.

102
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,020
Scott: So now we have a new company that owns us.

103
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:56,270
Scott: They didn't really give us a tech budget.

104
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,660
Scott: They just said when you want to buy something tell us and we'll get it for you.

105
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,750
Scott: Okay, so my boss, right?

106
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,172
Scott: Go it.

107
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:09,270
Scott: He went down to you know, the North Carolina where the where the new companies are and Well, there are new owners are anyway.

108
00:06:09,611 --> 00:06:12,521
Scott: And he saw that all the people there all the tech people had tons of monitors.

109
00:06:12,682 --> 00:06:15,672
Scott: one guy had three monitors stacked vertically on Each other.

110
00:06:16,134 --> 00:06:21,070
Scott: other people had like, you know big stretches out right and he's sitting there in his office, right?

111
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,195
Scott: Basically, he's now head of tech in New York.

112
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,063
Scott: He's got a 24 inch Dell ultra sharp.

113
00:06:26,103 --> 00:06:26,444
Scott: Not bad.

114
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:27,567
Scott: Not bad, right.

115
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:43,423
Scott: and also In addition to that I have this really I don't like it 22 inch Samsung Which is the same resolution as my 20 inch Dell and I would much rather either have you know B20 injured the same resolution or a 24 inch of the bigger resolution.

116
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,370
Rym: Actually, I would just prefer not a Samsung.

117
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,268
Rym: I don't like their screens.

118
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:51,882
Scott: Well, the thing is Samsung looks like I like their HDTVs a lot But I don't like their monitors.

119
00:06:51,922 --> 00:06:53,370
Rym: the monitors their new monitors.

120
00:06:53,491 --> 00:06:57,089
Scott: Their monitors used to be awesome when I bought those 17 inch Samsung's back in the day.

121
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,992
Scott: Yeah hot but nowadays poop I just.

122
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:02,870
Rym: basically they're too glossy and like they look they look cheap.

123
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:10,690
Rym: One of the more noisy really now It's all the ones we have at work like they're glossy and they have this really cheap glossy plastic Rym around him, right?

124
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,670
Scott: So my boss has this plan, right?

125
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,650
Scott: I wanted a new monitor because the color on the Samsung's fucked up anyway, and it was actually hindering some web work.

126
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:28,750
Scott: you know, I was seeing the wrong colors and whatnot and He wanted you know to sort of get you know Felt like he was getting played out because the people in North Carolina had better displays than needed.

127
00:07:28,871 --> 00:07:31,946
Scott: So and for other reasons, you know, he needs the way he works.

128
00:07:32,027 --> 00:07:36,190
Scott: He has windows He just opens his taskbar is basically loaded with way too much shit.

129
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:38,859
Scott: He just leaves everything open all the time and a million windows.

130
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,050
Scott: So he really needed another monitor anyway for the way he works.

131
00:07:42,332 --> 00:07:43,723
Scott: I don't cuz I have virtual desktops.

132
00:07:44,227 --> 00:07:55,550
Scott: So He ordered two 24 inch Dells, right and then he was gonna give his current 24 inch Dell Which is the previous model to me, right and then everything will be all cool.

133
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,585
Scott: Someone else who didn't care could take my 22 inch Samsung who wasn't a tech person.

134
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:00,649
Scott: They would be more than happy with it.

135
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:03,161
Scott: So he orders the 220 inch 22 inch Dells.

136
00:08:03,202 --> 00:08:09,970
Scott: and You know the I the one system in guy in New York sends a letter to North Carolina.

137
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,320
Scott: So they can order it and have it sent here and today to Dell.

138
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,630
Scott: boxes arrived obviously containing 24 inch monitors.

139
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:22,140
Scott: Right, he opens one up He sets it up You know and he had a problem because they were all.

140
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,204
Scott: he was dumb and he didn't.

141
00:08:23,264 --> 00:08:29,150
Scott: his computer didn't support didn't have two DVI outs and he bought the wrong video card and whatever and I could have done better job with that.

142
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:42,544
Scott: but you know, I sorted that out, but we noticed that this Dell monitor that showed up didn't have that the memory card slots on the side and Wait a minute, and that sounds like it's not an ultra sharp and the screen.

143
00:08:42,806 --> 00:08:43,870
Scott: you couldn't move it up and down.

144
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,768
Scott: All you could do is tilt it.

145
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:48,364
Rym: I'm moving my screen up and down to right and it didn't swivel left and right.

146
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:50,555
Scott: you had to just move it to the left Into the right.

147
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,209
Rym: you didn't get an ultra sharp.

148
00:08:52,451 --> 00:08:55,370
Scott: Well, we go and we're like, wait a minute, right?

149
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,947
Scott: So after a few minutes of confusion and whatever, you know first we're just like, I don't know.

150
00:08:59,987 --> 00:09:01,791
Scott: maybe you know That's that's it I don't know.

151
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:08,295
Scott: after some look I go to the Dell website and I see and I realize aha That is not the ultra sharp.

152
00:09:08,857 --> 00:09:10,562
Scott: That is the non ultra sharp.

153
00:09:11,163 --> 00:09:18,648
Scott: That is what has happened here and he's like Shit, I you know and I look the price of the ultra sharp is like 600 something dollars to the 24 inch.

154
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,784
Scott: But the non ultra sharp is like 300 something and that's the retail price.

155
00:09:22,804 --> 00:09:24,189
Scott: So we paid less than that.

156
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:26,670
Scott: So we go and we're like did we order the wrong one?

157
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:38,809
Scott: Let's check and we go and we look at the email that was sent to North Carolina and it says ultra sharp very specifically Which means North Carolina changed the order on us.

158
00:09:39,971 --> 00:09:40,734
Rym: Did that did you?

159
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:41,738
Rym: did you call him on it?

160
00:09:41,778 --> 00:09:43,927
Scott: Did you say hey, they're calling him on it.

161
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:44,650
Scott: That's not my job.

162
00:09:45,112 --> 00:09:46,036
Scott: I didn't order the monitors.

163
00:09:46,077 --> 00:09:48,629
Scott: The point is let this be a lesson to everyone out there.

164
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:59,748
Scott: You might think that selling your company is great because you get a pile of money But don't do it cuz they'll stiff you on the monitors And that's totally not worth it.

165
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:01,859
Scott: He was really pissed cuz.

166
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,044
Scott: a minute, you know, I think of it.

167
00:10:03,084 --> 00:10:11,030
Scott: you'd be pissed too if you were like You know, you're in charge of this company Basically, then you sell it to someone and then and now they stiff you on the monitor.

168
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:19,150
Rym: Well, the thing is, you know at what my argument if I were North Carolina would be Can you articulate to me why you need the much more expensive ultra sharp?

169
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:22,240
Rym: For any reason other than personal comfort and enjoyment?

170
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,109
Rym: it would be easier, right if swivel it you can.

171
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:35,310
Scott: Developers and the other tech people in North Carolina didn't have amazing monitor setups to you know Which we could point at but they had normal monitors down there.

172
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,399
Scott: We could point we couldn't point at them, but now we can.

173
00:10:37,881 --> 00:10:38,745
Rym: but why do you?

174
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:39,790
Rym: why should you have the same thing?

175
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,136
Rym: There's no business reason if you know.

176
00:10:41,177 --> 00:10:47,262
Scott: if you see how my boss works, you know that he needs that Plus, you know, he refused, you know, we're like that.

177
00:10:47,283 --> 00:10:47,966
Scott: we're tech people.

178
00:10:47,986 --> 00:10:50,418
Scott: We're very particular For the normal people.

179
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,949
Scott: they got no reason for the tech people.

180
00:10:53,352 --> 00:11:03,086
Rym: So anyway, you know, it's Thursday and we'd said a long time ago we'd slowly start changing up the format of Thursday because What I'm gonna talk about might seem like it's the thing today, but I'll get to why.

181
00:11:03,126 --> 00:11:03,970
Rym: it's news now.

182
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,094
Rym: I've talked about this man.

183
00:11:05,255 --> 00:11:05,938
Rym: There's legend.

184
00:11:06,118 --> 00:11:12,216
Rym: I thought you did this thing in there this legend among men Boring news first.

185
00:11:12,357 --> 00:11:16,300
Rym: I've talked about him kind of often on the show a long time ago But I hadn't talked about him in a long time.

186
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,145
Rym: I kind of forgot.

187
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:17,669
Rym: We forgot it.

188
00:11:18,072 --> 00:11:19,341
Scott: I never forgot the guy.

189
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:20,490
Scott: I forgot his name.

190
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:21,233
Rym: I just didn't.

191
00:11:21,494 --> 00:11:25,150
Rym: I stopped thinking about him because he wasn't on FARC all the time anymore.

192
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:30,454
Rym: And you know, he kind of faded from the limelight, but just recently, you know Scott asked me Hey, what was that guy's name?

193
00:11:30,514 --> 00:11:38,359
Rym: And sure enough acid every once in a while, but he asked recently and then sure enough Henry Earl appeared in the news again.

194
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:42,614
Scott: now Henry Earl my here one of my heroes not my top hero But he's on the hero list.

195
00:11:42,794 --> 00:11:46,810
Rym: I can say that I know the story of Henry Earl to heart.

196
00:11:47,113 --> 00:11:50,734
Rym: I know this man's ins and outs Familiar with Henry Earl.

197
00:11:51,095 --> 00:11:55,148
Rym: I am in fact because you see I've been really got intimate with Henry Earl for a long time.

198
00:11:55,409 --> 00:12:07,850
Rym: However I'm just going to read to you the Wikipedia about Henry Earl because the whole thing it's not that long But the way it is phrased I find it somewhat hilarious.

199
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:15,090
Rym: Henry Earl born October 24th, 1949 is a homeless man from Lexington, Kentucky.

200
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:19,310
Scott: I thought he had a home famous for his extensive police record.

201
00:12:20,131 --> 00:12:32,205
Rym: Nearly all of his arrests have been for public intoxication With a few charges of disorderly conduct third-degree trespassing Second-degree trespassing and at least one count of begging.

202
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:41,630
Rym: the fire Website showing Earl's arrest record from 1992 to present indicates that he's not been arrested for any theft or violent offenses.

203
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:45,790
Rym: So he pretty much is only ever arrested for public intoxication.

204
00:12:46,651 --> 00:12:48,364
Scott: You don't have to be afraid of Henry Earl.

205
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:53,917
Scott: if you meet this guy You should totally hang out with him be like whoo get him drunk And then he'll spend a night in jail.

206
00:12:53,997 --> 00:13:01,810
Rym: and there's in fact a problem in the area where he is Frequent to be frequently attends where college kids will spend their spring break.

207
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:05,090
Rym: They will actually go to Lexington, Kentucky and find him.

208
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:08,410
Rym: He's not difficult to find and take him around drinking.

209
00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:24,911
Rym: That is a common spring break trip, in fact, there have been stories on multiple groups of students from multiple schools Simultaneously each trying to bribe him to follow them around instead of the other group with increasing amounts of alcohol Times.

210
00:13:25,353 --> 00:13:32,250
Rym: Henry's rise to fame was in large part because of the Fayette County Jail at a public website Which listed a person's arrest record and mug shots?

211
00:13:33,051 --> 00:13:39,010
Rym: Henry had an extensive record and a wide range of emotions expressed in the mug shots from despondent to happy.

212
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:43,710
Rym: The page was linked to regularly by internet news blog FARC calm.

213
00:13:44,412 --> 00:13:48,549
Rym: The new website eventually had to be shut down due to the strain that was being placed upon it.

214
00:13:49,452 --> 00:13:54,630
Rym: Henry's made numerous talk show appearances has been featured in national and international media venues.

215
00:13:56,334 --> 00:14:07,669
Rym: Really I want to see that on November 16th 2005 it was reported that a 55 year old black man had died in police custody in Fayette County prompting speculation the Henry Earl had in fact died.

216
00:14:08,734 --> 00:14:12,358
Rym: The man turned out to be Donald Ross another man.

217
00:14:12,378 --> 00:14:13,883
Rym: It was not Henry Earl.

218
00:14:13,903 --> 00:14:17,058
Rym: people, you know, breathe breathe the sigh of relief In 2006.

219
00:14:17,058 --> 00:14:18,989
Scott: sigh of relief because someone died.

220
00:14:19,814 --> 00:14:21,784
Rym: Well, because it wasn't Henry Earl who does.

221
00:14:21,804 --> 00:14:22,910
Scott: I loved Henry Earl Moore?

222
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:31,119
Rym: Yes, because Donald Ross you see it also been arrested for third-degree assault Has never hurt anyone but himself.

223
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,143
Scott: Oh, that's okay.

224
00:14:32,384 --> 00:14:33,108
Scott: I guess kinda.

225
00:14:33,128 --> 00:14:41,349
Rym: in 2006 Henry Earl sobered up with his number of offenses a number of days spent in jail overwhelmingly lower than previous years.

226
00:14:41,971 --> 00:14:44,578
Rym: Fortunately, he returned to his old ways in 2007.

227
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:48,529
Scott: No, that's that's simultaneously sad and awesome.

228
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:54,240
Rym: now the thing is Henry Earl is kind of a folk hero and He got enough folk heroes.

229
00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:00,484
Rym: He exemplifies a A Idiom of life that I agree with in one regard.

230
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,850
Scott: He's a modern Johnny Appleseed.

231
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:09,290
Rym: If you're gonna do something be the best damn doer of that thing that they can possibly be.

232
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,415
Scott: Yeah, I mean think about it.

233
00:15:10,435 --> 00:15:10,636
Scott: right?

234
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:19,488
Scott: if you're like a meth addict, that's pretty sad But if you're an epic mecha meth addict, at least there's in the horribleness of your existence.

235
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:22,750
Scott: There is some like silver lining on your cloud.

236
00:15:22,891 --> 00:15:25,190
Rym: It could be a cautionary tale.

237
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:25,733
Rym: It's hard.

238
00:15:25,774 --> 00:15:28,249
Scott: because of being a meth addict that cloud is real dark.

239
00:15:28,471 --> 00:15:33,290
Scott: But if you're being a drunken hobo The cloud is a lot less dark than meth addict.

240
00:15:33,394 --> 00:15:44,409
Rym: basically If you can make the best of a bad situation or in the very least if your life can serve as a warning to others Then you have in some small way mitigated the misery that otherwise was your life.

241
00:15:44,851 --> 00:15:46,016
Scott: And I mean that guy.

242
00:15:46,056 --> 00:15:51,826
Scott: I mean think about all the hobos who just get drunk in a dark alley Wasting their lives away with no recognition, right?

243
00:15:52,711 --> 00:15:58,550
Scott: They're just sad and no one learns from them and they don't learn from anyone and their existences are just terrible.

244
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:04,870
Rym: Henry Earl is internationally famous and people fly to his hometown to find him and buy him drinks.

245
00:16:05,814 --> 00:16:08,909
Rym: Now the reason Henry Earl comes up is he was in the news recently.

246
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:15,265
Rym: Basically a bunch of news media had reported that Henry Earl had achieved a milestone in his life.

247
00:16:15,305 --> 00:16:20,390
Rym: He had been arrested for his 1,000th public intoxication incidents.

248
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:25,713
Scott: That's is that more arrest than anyone ever I Don't know.

249
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:34,190
Rym: what I do know is that this was patently untrue Because the people reporting were digging up a story and they basically didn't do all their research.

250
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:42,113
Rym: In fact, Henry Earl had reached that milestone long ago Has been arrested 1,333 times to date.

251
00:16:42,153 --> 00:16:48,035
Rym: Oh, man, he should stop at 1,337.

252
00:16:48,035 --> 00:16:51,490
Rym: I'm going to say this this is another quote from that Wikipedia.

253
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,115
Scott: Let's get arrested four more times and then go sober for real.

254
00:16:55,275 --> 00:16:56,657
Rym: I point out that in Wikipedia.

255
00:16:57,018 --> 00:16:58,260
Rym: This is the first citation.

256
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:11,829
Rym: in 2008 Earl was arrested for the 1,000th time since 1992. the judge sentenced him to 1,000 days in jail saying that the sentence was quote only fair.

257
00:17:13,172 --> 00:17:15,887
Scott: That judge is an awesome judge at that time.

258
00:17:15,907 --> 00:17:25,069
Rym: yet In fact when arrested one thousand three hundred and thirty three times since his first arrest in July of 1970, man They should send some just one night in jail for every friggin thing.

259
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:25,672
Scott: Why why?

260
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:27,882
Scott: why this thousand days keeping them off the liquor?

261
00:17:27,942 --> 00:17:29,328
Rym: maybe trying to help him?

262
00:17:29,468 --> 00:17:29,870
Rym: I don't know.

263
00:17:31,312 --> 00:17:38,698
Rym: So I would like to point out that if you wish to follow Henry Earl, there's in fact an RSS feed and The page you want to go to is called.

264
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,024
Scott: Is there a Firefox extension?

265
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:40,586
Scott: Yes you.

266
00:17:40,606 --> 00:17:46,670
Rym: whether he's in or out of jail It's much like the a pagoda Firefox extension that tells you whether or not a pagoda is alive.

267
00:17:47,073 --> 00:17:48,950
Rym: There is the Henry Earl Firefox extension.

268
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:49,635
Rym: At least there was.

269
00:17:49,655 --> 00:17:52,392
Rym: I don't know if it still exists or if it works in Firefox 3.

270
00:17:52,392 --> 00:17:55,390
Rym: That tells you if he is in jail or not in jail.

271
00:17:56,093 --> 00:18:06,229
Rym: But if you go to what's up with Henry Earl, which I will link to Every time you go there's a random mugshot of Henry Earl and let me tell you he's smiling in the vast majority of them.

272
00:18:07,812 --> 00:18:10,990
Scott: Even though he's a sad story there's something to like about Henry.

273
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:19,916
Scott: You in a way you should be Henry Earl, you know, whatever your lot in life is You should you should go full out.

274
00:18:19,977 --> 00:18:25,041
Scott: But in a way you shouldn't be Henry or you should not be Henry Earl homeless and drunken.

275
00:18:25,061 --> 00:18:32,693
Rym: I Can say one thing though Henry Earl has not harmed anyone but himself and that's more than you can say for a lot of other People out there.

276
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:33,437
Scott: that is true.

277
00:18:33,497 --> 00:18:37,949
Scott: In fact, Henry Earl has helped many other than himself mostly front behind.

278
00:18:38,971 --> 00:18:42,550
Rym: Anyway, so that was my exciting and interesting Thursday bit.

279
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:48,050
Scott: Why you gotta be using cool things of the day like Henry Earl right before my completely boring and everyday news?

280
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,455
Rym: Well, you see what.

281
00:18:49,756 --> 00:18:51,201
Rym: there are things I could have talked about.

282
00:18:51,321 --> 00:19:12,190
Rym: I really want to talk about the business with Obama calling McCain and being like yo, let's do something about this economic disaster and McCain saying, okay I'll call you back and then immediately hosting a press conference asking Obama to do something Great and then, you know trying to cancel the debate or I could talk about the fact You know that there was a general collapse in the stock market.

283
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:15,806
Rym: I could talk about all sorts of things but that all had to go on.

284
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:16,590
Rym: Oh, wait a minute.

285
00:19:16,831 --> 00:19:18,717

Scott: You know, I always hate the fake medicines.

292
00:19:32,423 --> 00:19:39,110
Scott: I'm well aware of your vitriol Yes, and recently the government has actually been cracking down and the fake medicines have been very nice.

293
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:44,109
Scott: They they're going after a fake cancer cure websites, you know that are in the US that they can actually go after.

294
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:50,590
Scott: They're you know, sort of crack it down and some false claims on various things, you know making them stop.

295
00:19:50,650 --> 00:20:05,683
Scott: there's there's some pretty good action going on in terms of fight against fake medicine and the FTC the Federal Trade Commission which you know sort of regulates commerce and makes sure you don't falsely advertise is You know doing its job and they have said that they're not gonna stop.

296
00:20:05,724 --> 00:20:07,010
Scott: this isn't like a one-time deal.

297
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:07,854
Scott: They're keeping an eye out.

298
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:08,980
Scott: They actually made a website.

299
00:20:09,683 --> 00:20:13,236
Scott: I think it's ftc.com Slash.

300
00:20:13,277 --> 00:20:14,045
Scott: is it curious?

301
00:20:14,187 --> 00:20:22,005
Rym: I think No, yeah, no you complain that I have a good news and yet you don't.

302
00:20:22,025 --> 00:20:22,927
Scott: you're not even ready.

303
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:23,890
Scott: I'm ready.

304
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,018
Scott: I just forgot about the sub.

305
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:25,803
Scott: say until - here it is.

306
00:20:25,843 --> 00:20:29,488
Scott: Yes, ftc.gov Slash curious you see my mess up there.

307
00:20:30,171 --> 00:20:36,568
Scott: Anyway, and it's a website that basically tells you how to spot fake cancer cures and tells you to be skeptical.

308
00:20:36,608 --> 00:20:38,618
Scott: and it's it's Curious get it.

309
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:43,020
Scott: See you are e - oh You're curious about the cure.

310
00:20:43,161 --> 00:20:44,507
Rym: Oh, wait, perhaps I should use hey.

311
00:20:44,768 --> 00:20:46,896
Scott: Oh Instead it's a good website.

312
00:20:46,977 --> 00:20:50,650
Scott: if you're you know, if you have cancer and you're really uninformed, it's that's a good place to go.

313
00:20:51,161 --> 00:21:02,410
Scott: but anyway so the government's doing a good job there, but there's a study recently and People have known for a long time many of the reasons that people go to fake medicine.

314
00:21:02,671 --> 00:21:07,710
Scott: Right, and one of the reasons people go to fake medicine is because when you go to the doctor, right?

315
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:14,136
Scott: the doctor a real doctor is usually not that nice or Attentive.

316
00:21:14,156 --> 00:21:15,390
Scott: they don't make you feel good.

317
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:20,470
Scott: They're actually kind of scared even even as much as I know that the real doctor is where it's at.

318
00:21:21,012 --> 00:21:25,070
Scott: It's not comfortable going to a hospital or a doctor's office or anything like that.

319
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,575
Scott: I mean you're in a hospital.

320
00:21:26,896 --> 00:21:28,903
Scott: the doctor maybe shows up once a day.

321
00:21:28,923 --> 00:21:33,461
Scott: It doesn't say much to you You know, it's it's not really pleasant.

322
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:35,410
Scott: The doctors don't do a lot to make you feel good.

323
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:44,980
Scott: But if you go to fake medicine, right some like bullshit, you know, homeopathy Chiropractors something something Acupuncture, you know meditation BS, right?

324
00:21:45,502 --> 00:22:02,469
Scott: They're not actually gonna help you with any actual medicine But they'll be real nice to you and they'll sit down and talk to you for a long time and make you feel really good In terms of you know, mentally speaking they'll be very reassuring with lies But it's reassuring and this is something we've sort of known.

325
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,723
Scott: but it was something you knew in sort of a common sense sort of way.

326
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:08,775
Scott: and well the There was a study.

327
00:22:09,136 --> 00:22:10,501
Scott: the study author was dr.

328
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:16,164
Scott: Diane Morse an assistant professor of medicine and psych Psychiatry at University to Rochester.

329
00:22:16,184 --> 00:22:25,790
Rym: Oh, yeah Despite RIT being the super geek school U of R had a far better arcade Yeah, and U of R was a big school for medicines.

330
00:22:26,372 --> 00:22:26,914
Rym: Yeah, they had.

331
00:22:26,934 --> 00:22:30,587
Scott: they ran the hospital that you know RIT students went to if they had a problem.

332
00:22:31,209 --> 00:22:35,289
Scott: anyway They did a little study there and they found that.

333
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:38,075
Scott: Well, I'll read from the little article here.

334
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:51,223
Scott: while doctors are able to address such concerns as medication issues missed appointments or pain They tended to skirt existential issues such as questions dealing with life and death Which are of paramount importance to most patients.

335
00:22:51,585 --> 00:23:03,469
Scott: the study author said Physicians only responded to 10% of empathic opportunities and when patients raised existential concerns Physicians tended to shift more to biomedical responses.

336
00:23:05,131 --> 00:23:20,490
Scott: Physicians had trouble addressing the bulk of concerns that were about patient fears Concerns about death or dying or worsening conditions and they go on and on and pretty much they studied and they found out Doctors really won't say anything to make you feel better now.

337
00:23:21,052 --> 00:23:24,870
Scott: They didn't go in to ask why doctors aren't saying these things, you know.

338
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:35,216
Scott: But I can come up with some ideas such as doctors are very concerned about being ethical and if they start You know getting too friendly and and you know close to you It might sort of break that.

339
00:23:35,276 --> 00:23:39,151
Scott: you know, what's appropriate for the patient doctor relationship, you know It's.

340
00:23:39,494 --> 00:23:48,192
Scott: it's real hard for you know, you know There's a lot of doctors who have to you know Sort of unpleasant things to your body and if they sort of know you too Well, it could.

341
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:53,870
Scott: I could imagine it being more difficult, you know than doing it in a cold and calculated matter of doctoring.

342
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:54,873
Scott: But yeah, it's.

343
00:23:55,114 --> 00:23:58,568
Scott: uh, it's pretty interesting and I've had an idea for a while.

344
00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:01,664
Scott: Let Rym Let me tell you I might have I told you this idea before that.

345
00:24:01,704 --> 00:24:01,966
Rym: All right.

346
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:02,710
Rym: All right, you can shoot.

347
00:24:02,931 --> 00:24:06,590
Scott: I think that when you go to a doctor or a hospital or something, right?

348
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,378
Scott: It's obvious that there needs to be.

349
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,070
Scott: you know, the doctors need to talk to you more.

350
00:24:11,251 --> 00:24:22,230
Scott: But the problem is not only do the doctors not want to you know, have ethical problems or you know Patient-doctor relations problems, but they also don't have a lot of time especially hospital doctors.

351
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:23,679
Scott: They got to treat so many people.

352
00:24:23,699 --> 00:24:32,349
Scott: they're running around from hospital to hospital You know, they can't spend too much time with any one person, you know They can't afford to sit there and talk to you because they actually had to be doing procedures.

353
00:24:32,811 --> 00:24:33,232
Scott: Do you know?

354
00:24:33,593 --> 00:24:35,759
Scott: checking people running tests, etc, etc.

355
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:44,705
Scott: I really think that there's a space to have a new job of Person who you can talk to at the doctor or at the hospital.

356
00:24:44,745 --> 00:24:52,430
Scott: just a person whose job it is to Talk to the patients and tell them what's up, you know who can know have enough medical knowledge to you know.

357
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:57,325
Scott: Read the charts see what your condition is, you know tell you about your condition and things.

358
00:24:57,586 --> 00:25:12,887
Scott: maybe not actually perform procedures or tests or make medical biomedical recommendations or you know prescribe anything or anything like that, but just You know to discuss your problems with you and make you feel better and such and we don't.

359
00:25:12,947 --> 00:25:14,131
Scott: I don't think we have people like That.

360
00:25:14,151 --> 00:25:18,249
Scott: I think we need them and maybe if we did people wouldn't go get fake medicine so much.

361
00:25:24,772 --> 00:25:26,799
Rym: Anyway things of the day now.

362
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:29,167
Rym: if GeekNights means one thing to you.

363
00:25:29,207 --> 00:25:30,893
Rym: It should mean Dedication.

364
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:35,990
Rym: you see I feel as though I have found a kindred spirit out there in the world of radio.

365
00:25:36,853 --> 00:25:37,916
Scott: I don't think I have.

366
00:25:38,859 --> 00:25:42,330
Rym: I have at least I mean to still be doing this after what five three years?

367
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:49,601
Scott: 500 plus crazy episodes 500 plus crazy episodes is not equal to what is in this video.

368
00:25:49,962 --> 00:25:52,008
Rym: This video is fantastic.

369
00:25:52,228 --> 00:25:52,910
Rym: It is pretty good video.

370
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:58,894
Rym: I mean, I just I don't really want to describe it but suffice to say a radio DJ is talking You know doing much like I'm doing now.

371
00:25:58,934 --> 00:25:59,997
Rym: He's leaned into his microphone.

372
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:08,309
Rym: He's talking increase something starts to happen behind him something Possibly dangerous and it's not like he doesn't notice it.

373
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:13,650
Rym: He basically turns around while still talking has this look of oh shit.

374
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:22,943
Rym: But he keeps talking without skipping a beat and meanwhile like you read like he turns his back on the thing that is happening Continues to do his radio thing.

375
00:26:23,144 --> 00:26:29,269
Rym: Obviously, he's live I guess waiting for someone to help him and eventually someone comes in to help him.

376
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:30,995
Rym: They do not help.

377
00:26:31,376 --> 00:26:35,730
Rym: the situation escalates and I will leave it as a surprise to you what happens in the end.

378
00:26:36,671 --> 00:26:41,287
Rym: This man is a tiny hero, he's a little bit more of a hero than Henry Earl.

379
00:26:41,508 --> 00:26:42,050
Scott: No, he's not.

380
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:44,136
Scott: He's just crazy and stupid I think.

381
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:48,750
Scott: but at the same time crazy and stupid makes for incredible video entertainment.

382
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:55,964
Rym: crazy and stupid awesome All right, however, I think the coup de grace today will be well.

383
00:26:56,004 --> 00:26:57,650
Rym: tonight is Scott's thing of the day.

384
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:00,239
Rym: Yes, I I have trouble not cracking up.

385
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,022
Rym: Just thinking about it.

386
00:27:01,243 --> 00:27:04,769
Scott: This video is one of the best videos I've seen in quite a long while.

387
00:27:06,231 --> 00:27:17,010
Scott: Many people, you know have trouble when listening to the hip-hop music's Comprehending what is being said and the same can be said for you know, metal music's or rock music's.

388
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:54,110
Scott: but in this particular case talking about the hip-hop music's and they listen to hip-hop music's and either because they are not familiar with the vocabulary or Because the way the words are enunciated they can't actually, you know, make them out with their ear, you know Perhaps because of slurring or or you know the rhythmic, you know movements of the words make it hard to decipher them Or many reasons why someone who is untrained in the in the arts is not used to listening to it would not be able to Comprehend exactly what is being said in the lyrics of hip-hop song if those lyrics were not written down and maybe even partially or fully translated.

389
00:27:55,254 --> 00:27:56,528
Scott: So what we have here is a video.

390
00:27:57,273 --> 00:27:58,057
Scott: It seems like there's.

391
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:10,227
Scott: it looks like a school gymnasium or equivalent Community center room pretty big actually a packed house and on stage There are a couple of hip-hop artists having a freestyle battle.

392
00:28:10,247 --> 00:28:16,930
Scott: a freestyle You know battle is where you know, they they hip-hop and they rap without any preparation.

393
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,440
Scott: They don't write the lyrics up beforehand.

394
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,098
Scott: They come up with them as They wrap them now.

395
00:28:21,139 --> 00:28:22,610
Rym: granted we could do a whole show about that.

396
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:28,570
Rym: It's a cool thing, but there's a lot of a lot of tricks and filler words and like things you do like freestyle.

397
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,521
Rym: Rap is difficult, but you can do a lot of preparation to be good at it.

398
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:33,750
Scott: Anyway, yeah, it's it's but to do it.

399
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,767
Scott: Well, really, you know, that's why they have competitions.

400
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:44,557
Scott: It's if someone, you know keeps falling back on say, you know a repeated phrase or theme, you know Well, they think of the next thing to say.

401
00:28:44,577 --> 00:28:47,930
Scott: that's not as good as someone who keeps coming up with newer and more indefinitely.

402
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:53,970
Scott: It's like a verbal fencing and someone who you know keeps the rhythm better without going uh, I mean you go.

403
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,145
Scott: Oh, that's like you lose.

404
00:28:55,246 --> 00:29:03,010
Scott: but you know Someone who keeps a better rhythm or has you know better rhyming words or clever rhymes is definitely getting ahead in the freestyle rap battle.

405
00:29:03,552 --> 00:29:08,910
Scott: Anyway, here's a video of a freestyle rap battle between a man named hydrogen and a man named boost.

406
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,410
Scott: The man named hydrogen, right?

407
00:29:12,371 --> 00:29:15,504
Scott: He does his rap followed by you know, the man named boost.

408
00:29:15,564 --> 00:29:17,010
Scott: then, you know, they decide who's the winner.

409
00:29:17,717 --> 00:29:18,465
Scott: This video.

410
00:29:18,606 --> 00:29:21,702
Scott: however The audio is completely dubbed over.

411
00:29:21,782 --> 00:29:23,690
Scott: there is none of the original audio is left.

412
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,099
Scott: The original video is but not the original audio.

413
00:29:26,621 --> 00:29:30,187
Scott: instead what we have are some white guys.

414
00:29:31,232 --> 00:29:37,860
Scott: they have translated the lyrics to the freestyle hip-hop battle and They speak them at.

415
00:29:38,787 --> 00:29:49,624
Scott: you know As they be hip-hopping is going on so that if you aren't someone who does not understand hip-hop lyrics You can watch this video and you will understand what these people are saying.

416
00:29:49,965 --> 00:29:51,330
Rym: now, I want to say one thing.

417
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:52,579
Rym: I got to say this pretty clearly.

418
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,396
Rym: This is Hilarious beyond belief.

419
00:29:56,878 --> 00:30:05,103
Scott: not only is the translation of the lyrics itself hilarious, right The end of the video has a special treat.

420
00:30:05,384 --> 00:30:06,770
Scott: That is the payoff.

421
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:18,976
Rym: basically I will not reveal because you're going to watch it wait for it because it's one of those things where like it's funny and you're really digging it and then Something happens and music starts playing and It is it is.

422
00:30:19,701 --> 00:30:20,990
Rym: it is somewhat hilarious.

423
00:30:21,214 --> 00:30:28,430
Scott: You could say yeah Do not do yourself a disservice by skipping around in this video or anything like that because you need the build-up or else it is.

424
00:30:28,491 --> 00:30:29,590
Rym: The payoff is not worth it.

425
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:36,817
Scott: Just play the video and watch it from beginning to end and then if you are not laughing I don't know what's wrong with you.

426
00:30:37,078 --> 00:30:40,290
Rym: It's such a I have a joke, but I can't make it without spoiling.

427
00:30:40,814 --> 00:30:46,967
Rym: Don't don't make it anyway tonight How you made the joke, that's right.

428
00:30:47,108 --> 00:30:57,982
Rym: so tonight Finally after a long long time of it being put off by various things We're to talk about Neal Stephenson's snow crash in a spoiler if ik.

429
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:00,710
Rym: final thoughts the GeekNights book club manner.

430
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:16,910
Scott: So if you haven't read snow crash, like we told you to and it seems like actually looking at a poll I put up maybe like half the people read it then 25% plan to or kind of sorta but then 25% No, so actually that's a lot better than we were thinking.

431
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:20,010
Scott: I think it's just the people who read it, you know weren't speaking out enough.

432
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:29,210
Scott: So I think we're just gonna force the book club because you know, it's sort of like in the library We have the signs that say read and a famous person with a book, you know, we're sort of like that.

433
00:31:29,332 --> 00:31:29,906
Scott: I think that's good.

434
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:38,530
Rym: I think we can avoid talking about a lot of the things we talked about when we Introduced this book in terms of you know, why like why we read it and why it's important.

435
00:31:38,671 --> 00:31:41,690
Rym: I forgot what we said when we introduced this book, but we'll have to touch on a lot of that.

436
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,016
Rym: Anyway, because it's kind of central.

437
00:31:43,036 --> 00:31:51,024
Rym: I mean the book itself is important Primarily because it kind of catapulted Stephenson into this I guess.

438
00:31:51,485 --> 00:31:52,007
Rym: Oh my god.

439
00:31:52,027 --> 00:31:52,850
Rym: He's a real author.

440
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:53,652
Rym: Look at what he wrote.

441
00:31:53,973 --> 00:32:05,110
Scott: Yeah, Neal Stephenson was pretty much just like a nerd author and then snow crash You know sort of brought him into being a real author who is respected although nerdy.

442
00:32:05,832 --> 00:32:10,926
Scott: So because of that we have two Neil's the Neil Stephenson and the Neil Guyman.

443
00:32:10,966 --> 00:32:12,150
Scott: do not confuse the two.

444
00:32:12,471 --> 00:32:15,162
Scott: It is very important that you have a clear separation in your mind.

445
00:32:15,523 --> 00:32:19,619
Scott: Neil Stephenson is NEAL Neil Guyman is NEIL.

446
00:32:20,221 --> 00:32:21,807
Scott: All right, very different people.

447
00:32:22,068 --> 00:32:22,730
Scott: No confusion.

448
00:32:23,432 --> 00:32:30,855
Rym: Well, the one thing we really have to just bring up again because it bears repeating is that this book was published in 1992.

449
00:32:30,855 --> 00:32:33,126
Scott: oh that just that freaks me out.

450
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:33,769
Scott: cuz I read it.

451
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,149
Scott: Well, not more than two years ago.

452
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:43,401
Rym: Basically you read it now and you think like it reeks of the 90s But it was written before the 90s really happened.

453
00:32:43,441 --> 00:32:44,063
Rym: Like you read it.

454
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:45,368
Rym: You're like, wow, it's the 90s.

455
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,644
Rym: This is what the internet was like in the mid late 90s.

456
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:52,428
Rym: This is what this is a 90s book, but it was basically written in the late 80s.

457
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:58,901
Scott: Yeah, if you wrote this book or a similar book now Everyone would say that's derivative crap derivative crap.

458
00:32:58,921 --> 00:33:05,150
Scott: and you know a part of the things some of the things in this book Right warrant completely original at the time of its writing.

459
00:33:05,794 --> 00:33:07,928
Scott: But a lot of it was a whole lot of it.

460
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:18,709
Rym: It was it was it was ahead of its time and that it it talks about the internet as it would be in the late 90s well before it happened with a scary degree of accuracy.

461
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:24,410
Rym: Granted I say with the degree of accuracy because it takes a lot of liberties.

462
00:33:24,491 --> 00:33:26,610
Rym: I mean the actual reality of what's going on in this book.

463
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:30,448
Rym: I mean the metaverse VR all those things which are really big in the 90s.

464
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:33,139
Rym: But VR never really came to pass.

465
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:35,610
Rym: like VR is almost entirely faded from the limelight.

466
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,957
Scott: Well, it's like any science fiction book.

467
00:33:37,997 --> 00:33:47,105
Scott: right when you write about the future you write about not the actual future usually But you write you know what that the vision of the future was in that time.

468
00:33:47,145 --> 00:33:48,188
Scott: like, you know, you read some 50s sci-fi.

469
00:33:48,951 --> 00:33:50,338
Scott: It's all like moon men and shit.

470
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,570
Rym: or you watch like a strange days Which is still one of my favorite sci-fi movies ever.

471
00:33:54,671 --> 00:33:56,449
Rym: But you look at you're like wow.

472
00:33:57,012 --> 00:34:02,110
Rym: That doesn't like you feel like the culture of the movie feels off like it doesn't feel like a future culture.

473
00:34:02,935 --> 00:34:10,550
Rym: but it was made in like 1991 and it's set in 1991 and 99. if you go back to 91 and you look at what the world was like and what?

474
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,312
Rym: America was like.

475
00:34:11,773 --> 00:34:15,263
Rym: you think wow back then I could see this as being the 1999 future.

476
00:34:15,764 --> 00:34:22,070
Scott: and then inevitably, you know After something, oh, you know science fiction book comes out and the future does happen.

477
00:34:22,431 --> 00:34:38,810
Scott: We look back and we always find you know Some facets in some science fiction book somewhere that match the future we have created and we always wonder Did we just take the fiction and make it reality or was there just so much fiction that no matter what reality happened?

478
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,092
Scott: Something would match it?

479
00:34:40,293 --> 00:34:46,550
Scott: and it's it's a tough question, but science fiction inevitably become science fact somehow eventually.

480
00:34:47,155 --> 00:34:48,223
Scott: It's just always been that way.

481
00:34:48,284 --> 00:34:52,989
Rym: I don't know why But we just talk about the book spoiler.

482
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:56,549
Rym: I mean the thing is it's not like other works like we talk about Ava.

483
00:34:56,871 --> 00:35:01,290
Rym: You know a lot of anime a lot of other books and there's just oh you can spoil it blah blah blah blah.

484
00:35:01,471 --> 00:35:03,427
Rym: But this is not really a spoilable book.

485
00:35:04,851 --> 00:35:06,138
Scott: That's kind of what I like about it.

486
00:35:06,219 --> 00:35:08,290
Scott: Is it you know, really spoiling?

487
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:18,816
Scott: I don't want to go into my spoiling rant But if something can be spoiled that means to me at least that it relies heavily or somewhat on surprise Right or twists of some kind.

488
00:35:19,298 --> 00:35:35,270
Scott: and if knowing the twist beforehand makes the work No longer enjoyable or as enjoyable then perhaps it was relying too heavily on the surprises and the twists Whereas a work that is continued to be enjoyed in successive rereadings, you know.

489
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,880
Scott: Or maybe you find new things each time you look at it.

490
00:35:38,182 --> 00:35:40,210
Scott: That is a long-lasting enjoyable work.

491
00:35:40,631 --> 00:35:45,290
Scott: You know, the Sistine Chapel or the Mona Lisa, you know, you can't really spoil them, right?

492
00:35:45,672 --> 00:35:46,021
Rym: She's marking.

493
00:35:46,571 --> 00:35:49,844
Scott: in fact, the more you look at them the more you enjoy them.

494
00:35:50,045 --> 00:35:50,226
Scott: right.

495
00:35:50,266 --> 00:36:00,250
Scott: and snow crash is Sort of like that in which the more you think about it The more you can see what was so important about it what it was saying the more things you can find in there to be.

496
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:07,889
Scott: But in other ways if you reread it there are certain things you notice that are maybe not so it's not perfect in any way.

497
00:36:08,912 --> 00:36:19,950
Rym: But yeah, well, you know speaking of not perfect the one real criticism I have and I have this with all any Stevenson work I've ever read but I guess it stands out more in this one because I think it's one of his earlier works.

498
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:30,246
Rym: But he while he can write very iconic action scenes Like you think to you know Listen to reason that whole business with reasons the kind of thing where a nerd reads it and go.

499
00:36:30,768 --> 00:36:34,572
Scott: Oh my god Moments.

500
00:36:34,974 --> 00:36:46,480
Scott: I really think that the whole reason thing in there while we love that listen to reason scene Right and while it's so awesome and this great joke and it's it's pretty fucking awesome and in a movie It would be so badass even in your mind when you're reading.

501
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,103
Scott: It's badass.

502
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:52,210
Scott: I Think that he really just put that in there because it was awesome.

503
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:59,201
Rym: But a lot of the scenes in this book and a lot of his works are like that and I mean it seems like it's Tamed as his works have gone on.

504
00:36:59,242 --> 00:37:06,700
Rym: but like you see it here There are a lot of scenes or moments that he was probably thinking man It'd be really cool if this happened and I kind of puts it in.

505
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:14,530
Rym: but yeah at the same time in the story if they Didn't have reason a lot like a lot of the plodges couldn't have had but it didn't have to be reason.

506
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:21,093
Scott: It could have been something else, you know calling it reason and making it specifically like that is sort of what the you know Is the it didn't.

507
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:29,233
Scott: really there's no reason it had to be called reason other than to make a joke and to be double Awesome, but I'm going to make but pretty much the most scathing criticism I have about Neal Stephenson.

508
00:37:29,674 --> 00:37:32,903
Rym: the dude can't write action scenes for crap.

509
00:37:33,103 --> 00:37:35,590
Rym: His action scenes are by and large awful.

510
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:36,639
Rym: They're confused.

511
00:37:36,941 --> 00:37:37,970
Rym: They're they're cloudy.

512
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:43,250
Rym: It's like he didn't plot out and he sort of like if you tried to film it based on what he wrote.

513
00:37:43,692 --> 00:37:47,310
Rym: It would basically be impossible and everyone who tried to film it would be completely different.

514
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:47,992
Rym: It's muddled.

515
00:37:48,634 --> 00:37:53,788
Rym: then the narrative kind of shifts in and out of all these different voices like Neal cannot write action scenes.

516
00:37:53,948 --> 00:37:55,555
Scott: Good God Well, I didn't notice that.

517
00:37:55,716 --> 00:37:59,011
Scott: the one thing that really stands out in my mind in that sense It's like.

518
00:37:59,031 --> 00:38:02,829
Scott: well the the two big action scenes that I can remember at least right are.

519
00:38:03,793 --> 00:38:10,668
Scott: In the early part is the car chasey bit right and where he's trying to deliver the pizza Well, he's not really a chase But he's trying to get the pizza there on time.

520
00:38:11,091 --> 00:38:13,139
Scott: Right and I could sort of follow that.

521
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:28,853
Scott: but really more in that scene was less about the actual Action happening and more about introducing you to the world, you know, the the crazy libertarian Corporate world or everything is privately owned and everything and how he gets on the highway owned by one company and pays a toll And all that stuff.

522
00:38:29,615 --> 00:38:34,910
Scott: but toward the you know, the climactic action scene of the what is a bicycle race in cyberspace, right?

523
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:37,260
Rym: Yeah, that scene was basically.

524
00:38:37,562 --> 00:38:38,104
Scott: it's a rhyme.

525
00:38:38,446 --> 00:38:42,690
Rym: Yes There wasn't much to that scene to be honest.

526
00:38:42,811 --> 00:38:45,270
Scott: No, I couldn't follow that scene at all.

527
00:38:45,411 --> 00:38:48,129
Scott: All I sort of got out of the scene was they're chasing, you know.

528
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:50,721
Scott: And it didn't have the suspense of one person's winning.

529
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:52,930
Scott: now the other person's winning now the other person's winning.

530
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:54,656
Scott: You know who's ahead or who's behind.

531
00:38:54,716 --> 00:38:57,445
Scott: it was just sort of like this crazy race going on.

532
00:38:57,505 --> 00:38:58,448
Scott: It's whoever wins.

533
00:38:58,508 --> 00:39:00,274
Scott: Oh my god I don't know what's going on.

534
00:39:00,314 --> 00:39:03,503
Scott: and then suddenly weird shits happening and then someone wins.

535
00:39:03,623 --> 00:39:13,407
Rym: Okay the end but also in general, I mean Obviously his later works are much better, but the writing in snow crash I'll be honest in a lot of points is a little amateurish like it.

536
00:39:13,427 --> 00:39:22,918
Rym: just then like the voice or the like the passive nature will come in and out and this it is disjointed and Chapters really don't flow into each other at all.

537
00:39:22,978 --> 00:39:24,864
Rym: And it's kind of just all over the place.

538
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:42,445
Rym: But at the same time I Don't know if it was intentional or not But the result of that the disjointed narrative almost kind of mirrors the world that he is presented to us this fractured Balkanized world that in the physical real world makes almost zero sense like it did.

539
00:39:42,846 --> 00:39:43,709
Rym: it couldn't really be.

540
00:39:44,354 --> 00:39:52,009
Rym: but at the same time if you look at Internet culture as it grew and what it became which I point out was far after he wrote this book.

541
00:39:53,431 --> 00:39:58,250
Rym: It's almost a perfect like metaphor or a perfect representation of what internet culture is like.

542
00:39:58,731 --> 00:40:06,179
Scott: Yeah, I mean in the book, right the one of the things I really love about snow crashes the world of snow crash Which is sort of like this libertarian paradise where?

543
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:11,217
Rym: well, it's a libertarian paradise It's a cast not a paradise.

544
00:40:11,237 --> 00:40:12,240
Scott: I didn't say it was a paradise.

545
00:40:12,321 --> 00:40:15,070
Scott: It said specifically is a capital L libertarian paradise.

546
00:40:15,131 --> 00:40:20,990
Rym: Yes, I guess you have to make sure that Libertarian paradise is in quotes and that you cannot construe paradise from it.

547
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:26,668
Scott: Yeah, it is a paradise only for libertarians or at least it is what libertarians say they want.

548
00:40:26,788 --> 00:40:27,149
Scott: right now.

549
00:40:27,932 --> 00:40:35,090
Scott: It is a world in which the US government is incredibly weak and limited and everything in you know The United States or they guess the rest of the world?

550
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,257
Scott: I don't know, but it's mostly.

551
00:40:36,297 --> 00:40:39,775
Scott: this story takes place in the United States or future United States.

552
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:44,070
Rym: there's narcolumbia the corporation instead of Columbia the company exactly.

553
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:51,242
Rym: There's Mexicali and and the fact that the mafia is just a franchise And you can just totally like get a job with it.

554
00:40:51,262 --> 00:40:52,688
Rym: Like you've got a job at McDonald's.

555
00:40:53,109 --> 00:40:59,086
Scott: all Everything in the country quotes right country is owned by some private company.

556
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:00,710
Scott: All the roads are privately owned.

557
00:41:00,951 --> 00:41:05,490
Scott: So if you drive on say mafia roads, you have to pay mafia tolls to use those roads.

558
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:14,630
Scott: They're not government roads for you know, everyone to share, you know You know if your your house is in one court, you're a citizen of a corporation, right?

559
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:18,270
Scott: He's a hero protagonist didn't even say his name yet right is the main character.

560
00:41:18,572 --> 00:41:21,750
Scott: He's basically a hacker with a samurai sword, you know nerd porn.

561
00:41:21,931 --> 00:41:27,253
Rym: I just have to say in terms I don't think we need to really explain because we're assuming that everyone listening to this has read The book.

562
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:32,077
Scott: All right, basically the hacker with the nerd sword What is he lives in like, you know, basically what.

563
00:41:32,097 --> 00:41:34,444
Scott: the equivalent of the Chinatown corporations like mr.

564
00:41:34,906 --> 00:41:35,187
Scott: Food.

565
00:41:35,247 --> 00:41:35,488
Scott: Mr.

566
00:41:35,528 --> 00:41:35,829
Scott: Lee.

567
00:41:35,969 --> 00:41:38,277
Scott: Oh, mr Lee's something Hong Kong, right?

568
00:41:38,337 --> 00:41:38,658
Rym: Yes.

569
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:41,047
Rym: I love the giant disclaimer that come.

570
00:41:41,187 --> 00:41:43,722
Rym: it's like welcome to mr Lee's blah blah blah and then giant disclaimer, mr.

571
00:41:43,843 --> 00:41:44,810
Scott: Lee's something Hong Kong.

572
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:46,754
Rym: Anyway, mr.

573
00:41:46,775 --> 00:41:47,781
Scott: Lee's greater Hong Kong.

574
00:41:47,801 --> 00:41:48,324
Scott: That's what it is.

575
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:51,017
Scott: Oh, yeah, mr Lee's greater Hong Kong is fucking awesome.

576
00:41:51,057 --> 00:41:55,294
Scott: If I lived in the snow crash world, I would be a citizen of mr Lee's greater Hong Kong.

577
00:41:55,635 --> 00:41:56,096
Rym: I don't know.

578
00:41:56,137 --> 00:41:57,421
Rym: I might join the Mafia.

579
00:41:57,522 --> 00:41:59,428
Scott: The Mafia is also really cool.

580
00:41:59,549 --> 00:41:59,830
Rym: I got it.

581
00:41:59,891 --> 00:42:06,806
Rym: I gotta say this now Uncle Enzo is like the coolest fucking dude ever forget right easily.

582
00:42:06,866 --> 00:42:07,227
Rym: Seriously.

583
00:42:07,287 --> 00:42:08,490
Rym: Uncle Enzo is cool.

584
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:13,469
Rym: Well, I think it's not like I'm a badass way, but I exactly totally cool do.

585
00:42:13,529 --> 00:42:13,870
Scott: Raven.

586
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:17,050
Scott: I actually don't like Raven, but he is badass.

587
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:19,365
Scott: But uncle Enzo is really.

588
00:42:19,385 --> 00:42:25,127
Scott: I think If there was someone in the book I wanted to be my friend it would be uncle Enzo.

589
00:42:25,147 --> 00:42:28,319
Rym: say this though I don't feel like uncle Enzo works as a character.

590
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,163
Rym: He does not.

591
00:42:29,504 --> 00:42:31,966
Scott: I think that's why he played such as you know small at least.

592
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:39,298
Scott: Uncle Enzo's the Mafia played a larger role, but him himself played a smaller Inconsistent and poorly conceived character.

593
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:46,390
Rym: However in the vein of this book He is awesome because this book is a collection of nerd pornography.

594
00:42:46,591 --> 00:42:48,978
Scott: Well, it's that's the thing is that it's hard.

595
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:52,910
Scott: the book does have a pile of nerd porn in it, right?

596
00:42:53,051 --> 00:42:53,834
Scott: It's got reason.

597
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:57,030
Scott: it's got bat the badass thing with the nuke on the bicycle.

598
00:42:57,411 --> 00:43:01,065
Scott: It's got you know, those hacker guys who have all the gadgets hanging off of them.

599
00:43:01,346 --> 00:43:02,410
Scott: It's got cyberspace.

600
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:07,704
Scott: You know, the main character is a pizza delivering hacker with a samurai sword.

601
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:23,037
Scott: Okay, this is nerd porn all over it But it very easy for someone who doesn't give the book a big enough chance to misconstrue the entire book as nerd porn from cover to cover all the way down to the bottom and There is a lot of nerd porn.

602
00:43:23,077 --> 00:43:25,910
Scott: but the nerd porn is the surface level activity in this book.

603
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:37,690
Scott: There is actually some deep high quality cyberspace Metaphors and things going on in this book and you could easily tell that same deep story with something else besides nerd porn on the top.

604
00:43:38,031 --> 00:43:40,360
Scott: But having nerd porn on the top just makes it better for us nerds.

605
00:43:40,842 --> 00:43:41,042
Scott: Right?

606
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:42,106
Scott: Am I right?

607
00:43:42,448 --> 00:43:43,030
Rym: Yeah, of course.

608
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:47,818
Rym: I mean, this is the book that has that famous speech We don't need to say the speech again about.

609
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:51,230
Rym: you know, every man blah blah blah wants to be a badass.

610
00:43:51,792 --> 00:43:54,563
Scott: It's exactly what all nerd guys think and you know what.

611
00:43:55,326 --> 00:43:56,129
Rym: we're past the age.

612
00:43:56,912 --> 00:43:57,454
Scott: It's too late.

613
00:43:57,634 --> 00:44:02,230
Scott: I think we are past the age but Stevenson knows cuz he obviously was a nerd.

614
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,930
Scott: He knows about the whole hog and you know Linux and whatnots.

615
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:06,514
Scott: So he knew.

616
00:44:06,956 --> 00:44:22,629
Scott: so it was easy for him to write a book that tapped in to our Demographic because he's in our demographic and it doesn't seem like a large number of Successful science fiction authors are in our demographic and also are lauded and successful like Stevenson is.

617
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,340
Rym: Now there's the only other.

618
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,910
Rym: I guess I'll get all my criticisms out of the way.

619
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:36,906
Rym: the only other thing that really kind of stood out is being bad about this book was there was a I Guess an attempt at a semi erotic scene between YT and Raven.

620
00:44:37,126 --> 00:44:38,473
Scott: see that for me I didn't.

621
00:44:39,056 --> 00:44:40,123
Rym: I remember all those days.

622
00:44:40,163 --> 00:44:50,066
Rym: that scene was written awkwardly, and I don't want to rag on Stevenson, but it was written as Though the person writing it had never had an erotic moment.

623
00:44:50,126 --> 00:44:55,470
Scott: right now first of all Right, the entire book has the Chekhov's gun of the stupid dentata, right?

624
00:44:55,710 --> 00:45:06,069
Scott: Yeah, and that is you know, while a Chekhov's gun is a fine literary mechanic It was used pretty poorly because they showed you the gun too many times They kept bringing it up and bringing it up and bringing it up.

625
00:45:06,351 --> 00:45:08,463
Rym: It's like if Chekhov walks out on stage who says

626
00:45:08,805 --> 00:45:09,610
Scott: I had a fucking gun

627
00:45:10,194 --> 00:45:15,529
Rym: I'm gonna fucking use it and he does this At the beginning of every act and then walks away and leaves the gun there

628
00:45:16,111 --> 00:45:19,222
Scott: Right and with shining bright lights on it and say right

629
00:45:19,523 --> 00:45:21,308
Rym: like the spotlight keeps going back to the gun.

630
00:45:21,389 --> 00:45:25,344
Scott: exactly So it Chekhov's gun is fine, but not you know, the it was a little too.

631
00:45:25,404 --> 00:45:26,388
Scott: Chekhov's gun.

632
00:45:26,408 --> 00:45:30,368
Scott: e right They can't he get coming out and reloading it and everything all the time, you know.

633
00:45:31,672 --> 00:45:33,118
Scott: And then came the scene.

634
00:45:33,198 --> 00:45:34,805
Scott: and when that scene was coming up, right?

635
00:45:34,906 --> 00:45:41,247
Scott: I knew basically Here's the time you saw it coming a mile away was the first problem right a Chekhov's gun.

636
00:45:41,287 --> 00:45:47,370
Scott: for it to be successful You need to at least shut up about it right before it goes off, right?

637
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:53,502
Scott: But no as soon as it was about to go off I said, oh and like, you know The next page is gonna go off and sure enough it did right.

638
00:45:53,863 --> 00:45:55,410
Scott: and in addition to that, right?

639
00:45:56,271 --> 00:46:00,829
Scott: I wasn't quite sure what was going on in that scene other than the fact that it was gonna go off.

640
00:46:01,332 --> 00:46:04,246
Scott: Really I couldn't tell otherwise what was going on.

641
00:46:04,306 --> 00:46:10,407
Scott: there was there Consensual activity which I think it actually was consensual activity, but not really.

642
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:11,190
Scott: I don't know.

643
00:46:11,432 --> 00:46:16,298
Scott: It made not a lot of sense to me But it sort of happened and that it was what it was.

644
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:22,930
Rym: but very specifically like the the scene where he's like got her up And he's like sitting on his lap.

645
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:23,331
Rym: It was just.

646
00:46:23,813 --> 00:46:27,386
Rym: it was so awkward like even the first time I read this book a long time ago.

647
00:46:27,406 --> 00:46:30,818
Rym: I remember going Wow Awkward.

648
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,799
Scott: yeah, it was It's not so great.

649
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:37,909
Rym: but I got one other thing I just got to say Elbab Rife.

650
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:40,970
Rym: Every time I picture him throughout the entire.

651
00:46:42,421 --> 00:46:45,086
Rym: No, I didn't picture Elron Hubbard, you know, I picture.

652
00:46:45,106 --> 00:46:47,509
Rym: I picture Duke Phillips from the critic.

653
00:46:49,201 --> 00:46:54,949
Rym: Look, I just I that is Duke Phillips is this guy like it is so him kinda.

654
00:46:54,969 --> 00:46:56,653
Scott: but I'm pretty sure I'm not.

655
00:46:56,813 --> 00:47:04,630
Scott: I'm just guessing here, you know, but just based on the nature of the character and the name that given to the character I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be an hour on Hubbard, right?

656
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:09,370
Rym: Oh, yeah, but Duke Phillips fits so much better because he's like this barrel so fit going around.

657
00:47:09,971 --> 00:47:11,805
Rym: You know devil may care guy.

658
00:47:11,865 --> 00:47:12,127
Rym: He's just.

659
00:47:12,409 --> 00:47:12,510
Scott: he's.

660
00:47:13,591 --> 00:47:24,366
Scott: No enough about Elron Hubbard the first time I read it to sort of get that Pictured him as one of those crazy TV evangelist guys, but he's also more an amalgamation of other people.

661
00:47:24,427 --> 00:47:25,490
Rym: I mean Bob.

662
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,144
Rym: Yeah, it definitely some Bob there.

663
00:47:28,164 --> 00:47:42,859
Rym: Yep Anyway, but you know despite the fact that the book is a little poorly written and you know A lot of scenes really awkward and the action scenes are incomprehensible the book Makes up for that almost pretty much a hundred and ten percent.

664
00:47:42,879 --> 00:47:46,970
Rym: Yeah with charm with style and with ideas.

665
00:47:47,191 --> 00:47:52,740
Scott: Yeah, I mean we wouldn't be making this book a GeekNights, you know book club I guess whatever we're gonna call this.

666
00:47:53,142 --> 00:48:02,250
Rym: if it was bad The book is just all right, I'd almost say it's a romp It's a ride and it's an excuse to bring out a lot of it.

667
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:09,713
Rym: Well a lot of really interesting ideas a lot of prescient ideas and a lot of just crazy ideas that are nonetheless Interesting.

668
00:48:09,974 --> 00:48:14,129
Scott: a lot of these ideas have been used elsewhere before and after.

669
00:48:14,169 --> 00:48:16,557
Scott: you know Very I mean the Tower of Babel.

670
00:48:16,898 --> 00:48:18,403
Scott: myth has been used.

671
00:48:18,584 --> 00:48:20,490
Scott: how many times however about a bajillion?

672
00:48:20,691 --> 00:48:27,030
Rym: I've never seen a work of literature take that idea and make it so pseudo scientific as this book made it.

673
00:48:27,451 --> 00:48:36,793
Rym: I mean taking those myths and legends and turning it into what he turned into with the neuro linguistic programming and all that business was just Amazing.

674
00:48:37,034 --> 00:48:50,474
Rym: and I think that cuz you know old Samaritan like so monarchy taso and you think oh wow Yeah, and when you're reading this book Everyone for a moment will be like, you know that kind of makes sense before their brain says no It doesn't shut up.

675
00:48:50,856 --> 00:48:53,649
Rym: Yeah, but there's that second where you're like, you know?

676
00:48:54,455 --> 00:48:56,168
Scott: Well, you know, it's not just you know.

677
00:48:56,771 --> 00:49:02,590
Scott: There's the there's the mat the the symbolism of the Tower of Babel and the neuro linguistic programming.

678
00:49:02,692 --> 00:49:03,429
Scott: But it you know.

679
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:09,368
Scott: The reason that the book is all nerd porn and hackers actually fits because he's actually talking about.

680
00:49:09,448 --> 00:49:16,210
Scott: is you know Assembly language and how sort of the assembly language has been lost and everyone's talking and see in Python.

681
00:49:16,651 --> 00:49:20,262
Scott: But if someone managed to learn assembly they could get down to the roots.

682
00:49:20,322 --> 00:49:23,563
Scott: it actually fiddle, you know with the with the with the guts of.

683
00:49:24,473 --> 00:49:25,317
Scott: You know the brain.

684
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:29,757
Rym: and I got to say when I was in high school hanging out with you know My high school D&D playing nerd.

685
00:49:29,797 --> 00:49:39,817
Rym: friends know me and Ken and Dan and Don, you know You play D&D then you watch some anime and then you all go to like the football field and hang out drinking soda looking Up at the stars and talking about stuff.

686
00:49:39,837 --> 00:49:42,006
Scott: that that's the kind of stuff you talk.

687
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:49,170
Rym: if you record that Conversation and listen to it ten years later You just shake your head and go wow every 16 year old is like that if they're a nerd.

688
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:52,300
Rym: But we had conversations like this like about this.

689
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,246
Rym: we talked about the brain language.

690
00:49:54,306 --> 00:49:55,510
Rym: now, you know that you know.

691
00:49:55,570 --> 00:50:04,121
Rym: You know, it's like high school kids are effectively stoners when they have these conversations except there There was no high school nerds at least but there's no weed involved.

692
00:50:04,282 --> 00:50:06,610
Rym: You're just stoned on geek nerd stuff.

693
00:50:06,992 --> 00:50:13,570
Scott: Yeah, like this book and you have got a high school kid and you read this book You're gonna be coming up with weird shit like that for weeks.

694
00:50:13,712 --> 00:50:14,710
Rym: Yes, but good God.

695
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:16,095
Rym: but no we talk.

696
00:50:16,115 --> 00:50:19,709
Rym: you know lay in there after our D&D game all in like the football field about like.

697
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:27,509
Rym: Yeah, the brain language, you know that language that when you're thinking right your brains not thinking in English like it is.

698
00:50:28,172 --> 00:50:30,862
Rym: But there's that undercurrent that other language down there.

699
00:50:31,444 --> 00:50:33,130
Rym: What if it's the same in everyone's brain?

700
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:34,656
Rym: What if we could communicate with that?

701
00:50:34,977 --> 00:50:36,222
Rym: That would be hardcore.

702
00:50:36,483 --> 00:50:39,878
Rym: Yeah, we could totally hack people If only we could understand it.

703
00:50:39,918 --> 00:50:40,822
Rym: and then this book is like.

704
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:42,650
Rym: it takes that and it did.

705
00:50:43,252 --> 00:50:48,750
Scott: Well, it takes that it can it can compares and contrast it to you know, the computer programming hacking, right?

706
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:58,117
Scott: But then also on the other level you have you know, the the reality of it Which is that language and you know The English language or whatever language you speak and does.

707
00:50:58,137 --> 00:51:02,330
Scott: that could be restraints on that language do restrain how people think.

708
00:51:02,932 --> 00:51:07,450
Scott: You know, how many times is there an argument that comes down to semantics and the semantics of the word you use?

709
00:51:07,771 --> 00:51:14,070
Scott: constrain your ability to come up with different ideas if you don't have the words to go with those ideas or or to communicate with.

710
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:15,034
Rym: Now what's really interesting?

711
00:51:15,054 --> 00:51:26,110
Scott: how you can use words in a way to you're not directly actually Controlling people the way you control a microprocessor with assembly language, but you know propaganda and marketing and whatnot.

712
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:34,250
Rym: But using words in certain ways you can control how people think and act, you know, I gotta say there's a point I can't really make because it would spoil other works.

713
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:42,278
Rym: But Scott think about the all the business here and think about the way Magic and everything works.

714
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:48,870
Scott: I was gonna say that I was actually trying to say that like a minute ago But I decided that I didn't want to do some Prince of Nothing spoilers in the snow.

715
00:51:49,051 --> 00:51:51,104
Scott: That's why I can't make the argument be fair.

716
00:51:51,285 --> 00:51:59,370
Rym: I can't make the argument I want to make but just the ideas of this book Really add a lot to the Prince of Nothing and vice versa.

717
00:51:59,591 --> 00:52:04,170
Scott: I'll go with this right is you know, you've listened to me and Rym talk a lot, right?

718
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:08,670
Scott: And whenever there's any idea or any any discussion of anything, right?

719
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:13,210
Scott: What do we always do even with games with anime or with any you know with anything?

720
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:16,647
Rym: We immediately boil it down to core semantics and then bitch about exactly.

721
00:52:16,687 --> 00:52:24,510
Scott: we head To the core when we look at something like wow, we ignore the surface level stuff We scrape that all off the barnacles, right?

722
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:31,877
Scott: We cut it open and we look to the heart of the matter as if that is that is it really matters the fundamental Nature of the thing.

723
00:52:32,359 --> 00:52:34,530
Scott: Oh, yeah, you've got this board game with all these great rules.

724
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:41,190
Scott: Well, actually this game is just rock-paper-scissors at the core or you know, oh you've got this, you know great anime.

725
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:48,510
Scott: Well actually at the core, this is just another, you know Monster of the week show even though the robots look really cool or whatever, right?

726
00:52:48,590 --> 00:53:16,786
Scott: We we go straight for the core and all of these different geek works here all sort of have this Idea that there is a there is a language or is there there is a way of controlling the core of Manipulating things at the core level going straight to the bottom ignoring the fluff, you know working with the the the true matter the Whatever it is the the pure essence of things and then thus, you know, the rest of everything comes out of that.

727
00:53:16,806 --> 00:53:18,494
Scott: I Don't know.

728
00:53:18,798 --> 00:53:21,959
Scott: Yeah, it's an idea We like a lot because it matches how we think.

729
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:27,830
Scott: or perhaps, you know it being exposed to these ideas So much it shaped how we think but you know.

730
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:32,773
Rym: Anyway, just to get back to the book itself one thing I can say that maybe it's because you know I read.

731
00:53:32,874 --> 00:53:39,302
Rym: I've read a lot of Kurt Vonnegut since I first read snow crash But I see a lot of Kurt Vonnegut ideas in snow crash.

732
00:53:39,342 --> 00:53:40,948
Rym: not, you know, there's some of it there.

733
00:53:41,168 --> 00:53:46,470
Rym: mostly, you know I read hocus-pocus which is one of my more favorite works of Kurt Vonnegut's and I didn't read that one.

734
00:53:46,571 --> 00:53:57,390
Rym: It's a good one But I feel as though there are strong Similarities in some of the overarching themes not the plot of snow crash but a lot of the themes of snow crash.

735
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:07,283
Rym: Definitely, I don't know if they were drawn from hocus-pocus or if they're just parallel and analogous But I feel this connection that I can't really articulate deeply.

736
00:54:07,343 --> 00:54:10,934
Rym: unless you've read Kurt Vonnegut's hocus-pocus Which you should all read.

737
00:54:10,995 --> 00:54:13,343
Rym: it's a great if somewhat depressing book.

738
00:54:14,025 --> 00:54:15,189
Scott: Yeah, I mean there's.

739
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:16,728
Rym: It's also short.

740
00:54:17,011 --> 00:54:23,850
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of reminds me at least a little bit of cat's cradle in which they sort of have that narrative structure.

741
00:54:24,111 --> 00:54:35,950
Scott: That's pretty typical and a lot of works of we give you some word or some phrase or something early on like snow crash Or ice nine or something something along those lines right away, right?

742
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:39,785
Scott: And then you sort of don't learn what it is until later.

743
00:54:39,886 --> 00:54:43,900
Rym: Sometimes it's lame Sometimes it's hackneyed but like both around I never learn it.

744
00:54:44,061 --> 00:54:46,670
Rym: Boca Rado did it like the best I've ever seen anything.

745
00:54:46,932 --> 00:54:48,810
Scott: It's not a bad literary technique.

746
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:52,083
Scott: It's used quite often to great effect and you can see why right is you?

747
00:54:52,284 --> 00:54:53,810
Scott: you give him someone's pretty solid.

748
00:54:54,293 --> 00:54:56,047
Rym: He's a prince of nothing, right?

749
00:54:57,031 --> 00:55:00,830
Scott: It's like you give somebody a label, right?

750
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:02,229
Scott: But you don't know what the label is.

751
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:07,226
Scott: So that now this you've created this empty box that they can't see all this closed box.

752
00:55:07,266 --> 00:55:10,109
Scott: They know the box is there They can't see inside of it.

753
00:55:10,311 --> 00:55:17,529
Scott: They know there's something in there and over time You slowly reveal or don't and then suddenly reveal or never reveal what's in the box.

754
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:20,383
Scott: and That's a great way to keep someone reading something.

755
00:55:20,443 --> 00:55:21,730
Scott: is I want to know what's in the box?

756
00:55:21,871 --> 00:55:29,026
Scott: Oh, I don't know what's in the box and you can do it Well, and you can do it poorly and snow crash actually does it pretty well, you know, what is snow crash?

757
00:55:29,628 --> 00:55:42,030
Scott: Oh It's this, you know Neurolinguistic virus that can infect people and computers at the same time because it consists, you know The base or language or again babble nerd porn here.

758
00:55:42,592 --> 00:55:43,174
Rym: Is that not?

759
00:55:43,195 --> 00:55:46,849
Rym: I mean to to quotes a somewhat infamous movie?

760
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:54,250
Rym: Hack the planet is nothing more pornographic to nerd hackers than the ability to hack the real world.

761
00:55:55,711 --> 00:55:56,995
Rym: Not much not much.

762
00:55:57,035 --> 00:55:59,341
Scott: I mean, that's what that's what hacking is all about.

763
00:55:59,381 --> 00:56:01,206
Scott: hacking isn't just about computers.

764
00:56:01,266 --> 00:56:19,830
Scott: hacking is about, you know Finding flaws in systems ways to to manipulate systems or pretty much doing anything you can to to boost You know power in unseen ways, you know You see something and you say aha actually I can get that to go twice as fast and twice as easily by just doing this.

765
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:22,430
Scott: Yeah, you know that's that's what hacking is all about.

766
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:40,890
Scott: so the idea of being able to control things at the lowest level is sort of like the ultimate in hacking because Having you know Root access and being able to just type in any assembly command you want Allows you the full power and once you've achieved that that is sort of like the be-all-end-all of hacking.

767
00:56:41,051 --> 00:56:46,070
Scott: I have controlling everything at the lowest possible level with the highest level of power.

768
00:56:46,873 --> 00:56:50,245
Rym: Now there's also there's a lot of little I don't know I keeps.

769
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:51,875
Rym: I said charm a couple times But there are.

770
00:56:51,956 --> 00:56:57,298
Rym: there's a lot of really Interesting style to the way people talk or like.

771
00:56:57,398 --> 00:57:04,950
Rym: the best example of this is day it and I'm pretty sure I would pronounce his Name dead, you know dia is David but da5 ID real.

772
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:06,158
Scott: I just called him in my.

773
00:57:06,299 --> 00:57:06,742
Scott: I was having.

774
00:57:06,762 --> 00:57:07,165
Scott: that's the thing.

775
00:57:07,185 --> 00:57:13,249
Scott: when I read it My mind is a hard time saying his name because I want to call it David, but there's a five there instead of a weird.

776
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:18,090
Scott: But so I'm like is it day five ID day fit, you know, but I don't have that problem.

777
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:18,896
Rym: But like the way

778
00:57:18,957 --> 00:57:19,541
Scott: I've ID

779
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:40,870
Rym: the way my brain Processes names and I think it's partly because I got on the internet and I got online real early and I spent a lot of Time, you know back when avatars and shared spaces were a much bigger deal on the internet and like real-time Avatar based communication and like real-time Chad was real important compared to how important it is now.

780
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:44,770
Rym: Well now you people are really into the time shifted Chad and I could do a whole show about that business.

781
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:55,142
Rym: But back then like my I would process because everyone had a lead hacker name and when I say lead I mean Old-school lead like the lead that no one uses anymore.

782
00:57:55,203 --> 00:57:57,270
Rym: the lead that was really stupid had a name like that.

783
00:57:57,331 --> 00:58:00,374
Scott: Now people would think you were eight years old Yes but or 13.

784
00:58:00,374 --> 00:58:10,370
Rym: back then like a lot of people used words and names like that like day it and My brain processed all those names as blobs as like they were like there were not letters in the name.

785
00:58:10,431 --> 00:58:12,629
Rym: The name itself was a unit in my brain.

786
00:58:13,052 --> 00:58:21,170
Rym: so when I see this my brain just like uses the unit and Translates it kind of has a look-up table that translates it into a way to pronounce it.

787
00:58:21,351 --> 00:58:28,890
Scott: So my brain looks at you know date da5 ID and just sort of goes dead Id you know and it's just like I want to say David.

788
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:32,470
Scott: But when I try to say David in my mind looking at that my brain goes

789
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:48,210
Rym: ah, see, I think my brain I tend to make blobs like to the point where if someone has a title or There's a phrase even a long phrase or a sentence even that appears more than one time in a book It immediately becomes like compressed into this blob.

790
00:58:48,312 --> 00:58:53,810
Rym: So when I see it again I skip it and move on to the rest of the words just kind of already having known what that was.

791
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:56,889
Scott: So see how nicely this conversation relates to the main idea in this book.

792
00:58:57,072 --> 00:58:58,290
Rym: That was kind of my intention.

793
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:03,790
Rym: But yeah day it just immediately like I saw it and my brain said date and that was how I pronounced it.

794
00:59:03,992 --> 00:59:04,901
Rym: I feel like that's correct.

795
00:59:04,942 --> 00:59:05,609
Scott: I'll talk about him.

796
00:59:06,398 --> 00:59:08,773
Rym: I don't have a lot to say about him But just the name.

797
00:59:08,814 --> 00:59:14,730
Rym: and there's a lot of things in the book like that that really set up the way the internet is today.

798
00:59:15,656 --> 00:59:21,610
Rym: Just reading this book again You know, I just feel as though the world it sets up could never exist in the physical world.

799
00:59:22,052 --> 00:59:25,529
Rym: But the world it sets up is what the internet is like now.

800
00:59:25,971 --> 00:59:28,681
Rym: Yeah in a like in a direct and real sense

801
00:59:28,942 --> 00:59:44,359
Scott: and sort of debt and sort of trying to create this You know world of libertarian paradise He actually, you know created a physical world that matches our modern virtual world and his virtual world sort of matches the fictional Virtual traditional

802
00:59:44,399 --> 00:59:45,709
Rym: is a perfectly chromulant word.

803
00:59:45,810 --> 01:00:00,695
Scott: Yes, the fictional virtual world which sort of never going to exist, you know Sort of the idea that everyone always had of oh, well, I'll just sort of go and you know so like reboot which is sorry, I guess kind of like it but more like What was that really bad movie?

804
01:00:00,735 --> 01:00:08,664
Rym: you watch Avalon, oh my god, oh my god I'd forgotten about that movie that sepia tone piece of shit.

805
01:00:08,785 --> 01:00:10,778
Rym: That was one of the worst movies I've ever sat.

806
01:00:10,919 --> 01:00:11,789
Scott: it was pretty terrible.

807
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:17,253
Rym: Then you realize that that is the lot because I'm one of those people who if a movie is bad enough I will walk out.

808
01:00:17,293 --> 01:00:19,740
Rym: I'll turn it off and say no not worth it.

809
01:00:20,322 --> 01:00:25,823
Rym: I've walked out of or stopped watching maybe Three movies in my life one of which was Clifford.

810
01:00:25,843 --> 01:00:29,720
Rym: I Think Avalon was the worst movie.

811
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:30,804
Rym: I've not walked out on.

812
01:00:31,065 --> 01:00:32,250
Scott: I know I still don't happen.

813
01:00:32,933 --> 01:00:33,696
Rym: I know what happened.

814
01:00:34,017 --> 01:00:40,600
Rym: the movie tried to set it up self up to be deep and serious And then it had a turnabout and I was like, oh wow.

815
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:42,866
Rym: Oh man, this movie's awesome.

816
01:00:43,488 --> 01:00:57,726
Rym: And then It had another turnabout which basically undid all the goodwill I had toward the movie and in an instant I went from wow This movie was okay - this movie was not worth any amount of investment or time.

817
01:00:58,006 --> 01:01:00,029
Rym: This movie is oh my god I hate that movie.

818
01:01:00,151 --> 01:01:01,741
Scott: I don't know why people hyped it up so much.

819
01:01:01,761 --> 01:01:02,687
Rym: that movie was terrible.

820
01:01:02,727 --> 01:01:04,109
Rym: if you like it You're a terrible person.

821
01:01:04,351 --> 01:01:08,994
Scott: If you know if you don't know what we were talking about don't ask or I'll say this I'm gonna spoil it.

822
01:01:09,014 --> 01:01:10,119
Rym: No, I'm not gonna spoil it.

823
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:11,183
Rym: Don't watch it.

824
01:01:11,565 --> 01:01:12,288
Rym: It's not worth it.

825
01:01:12,569 --> 01:01:12,830
Scott: It's not.

826
01:01:13,011 --> 01:01:14,918
Rym: I'm not even gonna say why it's not worth it.

827
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,124
Rym: It's not worth it.

828
01:01:16,445 --> 01:01:20,283
Rym: And if you don't believe me Well, you're a. you deserve what you get.

829
01:01:20,303 --> 01:01:21,690
Rym: trust me it's not worth it.

830
01:01:23,136 --> 01:01:23,668
Rym: It's an Odin.

831
01:01:24,816 --> 01:01:25,610
Scott: Yeah, it's weird.

832
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:32,235
Scott: It's sort of like the virtual world in snow crash is sort of like the virtual world that everyone wanted to come to be But hasn't yet and might never.

833
01:01:32,877 --> 01:01:37,751
Scott: but meanwhile the real world in snow crash is almost exactly like the word The.

834
01:01:37,972 --> 01:01:41,530
Scott: you know virtual quotes, you know internet world that we have today But

835
01:01:41,570 --> 01:02:00,389
Rym: not in a literal sense like the literal actions in the book like the way the metaverse is That the whole idea of the metaverse is something that came into being you know without the VR obviously but the metaverse existed and Then stopped existing because it almost immediately became obsolete in the eyes of the majority of people on the internet.

836
01:02:00,892 --> 01:02:12,938
Scott: Well only because the you know, we didn't have that, you know science fiction Virtual reality interface where you sort of tap in and suddenly you're in this other world and it's it's like another world You've actually transported to and you've.

837
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:21,089
Scott: you're completely separate from the real world Feel and see and walk and you know spaces that were functionally like that with everything except the.

838
01:02:21,169 --> 01:02:24,180
Rym: you know Virtual VR immersion like second life.

839
01:02:24,883 --> 01:02:26,610
Rym: Well, yeah, except like same came a lot later.

840
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:31,255
Rym: I'm talking about a lot of earlier things then I'd Early second life's that were no good.

841
01:02:31,355 --> 01:02:34,904
Rym: I participated in all the second life is but it's like before.

842
01:02:35,405 --> 01:02:41,070
Rym: that thing became technologically feasible in the nerd pornography sense.

843
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:51,597
Rym: other Unforeseen technology like time-shifting Communication did not really Exist back then like it does today.

844
01:02:51,637 --> 01:02:54,307
Rym: I mean we we've even time shifted chatting.

845
01:02:54,528 --> 01:02:55,130
Rym: What is Twitter?

846
01:02:55,511 --> 01:02:58,710
Rym: It is time shifted space shifted chatting.

847
01:02:59,212 --> 01:03:08,245
Rym: Yeah in many ways and and time the forums and all these things took off in a way that Obsoleted many of the benefits of the metaverse now obsolete.

848
01:03:08,265 --> 01:03:09,350
Scott: It is also perfectly crime.

849
01:03:09,471 --> 01:03:16,158
Rym: Yes, it is made obsolete provided obsolescence for yeah but I don't know.

850
01:03:16,178 --> 01:03:20,057
Rym: I feel like it was prescient in a lot of ways but the literal truth of it did not come to be.

851
01:03:20,161 --> 01:03:21,349
Rym: but What?

852
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:26,945
Rym: Fundamentally the internet is today is exactly like the real world of snow crash and I keep saying that.

853
01:03:27,005 --> 01:03:28,630
Rym: but it's so true.

854
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:37,586
Rym: It's this bogan eyes set of different cultures and you buy in you join The cultures that most agree with you and you're walled off from the cultures.

855
01:03:37,606 --> 01:03:38,410
Rym: You don't agree with.

856
01:03:39,113 --> 01:03:41,990
Scott: Yeah, the government is relatively weak, but present.

857
01:03:42,622 --> 01:03:46,502
Rym: Yes present But can't actually do anything to you unless you're stupid or you mommy.

858
01:03:46,602 --> 01:03:49,030
Scott: is it off the mafia or criminal element is?

859
01:03:49,270 --> 01:04:02,070
Rym: Actually, not that evil and people kind of okay with it and it's you know It's also perfectly legitimate outside of you know, like outside of the US things that are totally illegal are totally okay on the internet.

860
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:08,351
Scott: Yep, there are plenty of cool places for just people to hang out and you know with each other and be cool like, you know Mr.

861
01:04:08,391 --> 01:04:12,930
Rym: Lee's greater Hong Kong with their robot dogs, you know, like the front row crew forums, which you should all join.

862
01:04:13,252 --> 01:04:21,589
Rym: Oh my god, I don't want to talk about the implications of the ramifications But the rat things that that was some great right that wasn't great writing, but it was great work

863
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:31,823
Scott: Yep, and their religious nut jobs You know have crazy ideas and they completely separate themselves from the world and hide and do crazy things that actually Can harm lots of other people.

864
01:04:32,105 --> 01:04:38,858
Rym: I got to admit I got a little bit of a kick out of the fact that in the world of snow crash all Religion is basically boiled down to Scientology.

865
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:39,701
Scott: Yeah.

866
01:04:40,122 --> 01:04:40,363
Scott: Yeah.

867
01:04:40,604 --> 01:04:42,230
Scott: Well, aren't this two religions go?

868
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:42,651
Scott: Well, there's.

869
01:04:42,731 --> 01:04:44,118
Scott: there's a bunch of religions, but there's two.

870
01:04:44,299 --> 01:04:50,019
Rym: but the sacrament of swiping the credit card I just yeah, it's kind of like wow.

871
01:04:50,481 --> 01:04:56,330
Rym: This point was made in a very inelegant way, but yet I still found it hilarious.

872
01:04:56,936 --> 01:04:58,751
Scott: Well, I mean cuz that's what it is right Is it?

873
01:04:59,112 --> 01:05:07,284
Scott: sometimes you can you know, you can be deep and subtle about making your point about you know The religion is sapping money or you can be blatant with it, right?

874
01:05:07,304 --> 01:05:23,335
Scott: You can come out and be like, yeah They're taking everyone's money but if you just say it like that, it's sort of rough and and sort of it's sort of like a to to I Don't know blunt, right but by pushing it out real hard, but also put a little spin on it You know how.

875
01:05:23,375 --> 01:05:25,270
Scott: the sacrament of the credit card?

876
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:32,961
Scott: It's like ah now it's suddenly it feels a lot like, you know, the commercials in You know what it is, oh that's a good example, but it's not.

877
01:05:33,423 --> 01:05:35,750
Rym: it's not blunt like just a blunt ugly object.

878
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:38,517
Rym: It's blunt like a snub nose bullet like it's.

879
01:05:38,878 --> 01:05:45,940
Rym: the example I would use is it is not the clean and elegant Weapon of days past aka the lightsaber.

880
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,044
Scott: It's it's reason.

881
01:05:47,525 --> 01:05:48,830
Rym: it is more a blaster.

882
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:52,000
Rym: Yeah, efficient and gets the job done.

883
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:56,224
Scott: Yeah reason is not efficient, but oh my god Listen to it.

884
01:05:57,356 --> 01:06:06,617
Scott: The only reason he called that thing The only reason he called it reason is so he could make that joke by having that guy say they'll listen to reason and yet The book is full of things like that.

885
01:06:06,778 --> 01:06:09,670
Rym: Oh, by the way Juanita coming back at the end is total bullshit.

886
01:06:10,294 --> 01:06:11,462
Scott: I I agree with that camp.

887
01:06:11,482 --> 01:06:13,451
Rym: that was out of nowhere Bullshit.

888
01:06:13,873 --> 01:06:16,361
Rym: Yeah that whole like in fact, you know what.

889
01:06:16,401 --> 01:06:20,896
Rym: the whole resolution of the plot was pretty much bullshit But you didn't I see.

890
01:06:20,916 --> 01:06:22,703
Scott: the problem is is I think the plot.

891
01:06:22,944 --> 01:06:26,756
Scott: as soon as they had a scene with the helicopter That should have been the end.

892
01:06:26,877 --> 01:06:31,090
Rym: but instead there's that kind of BS useless fight between Enzo and Raven.

893
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:32,193
Rym: It's like the one.

894
01:06:32,233 --> 01:06:34,681
Rym: this scene is poorly written - it serves no purpose.

895
01:06:34,721 --> 01:06:35,002
Rym: three.

896
01:06:35,503 --> 01:06:39,856
Rym: It's actually kind of boring and for It wasn't good.

897
01:06:39,896 --> 01:06:40,478
Rym: I didn't enjoy.

898
01:06:40,578 --> 01:06:44,510
Scott: if I made snow crash the movie the end of the movie would be they get in the helicopter.

899
01:06:44,831 --> 01:06:45,775
Scott: They say who are you?

900
01:06:45,795 --> 01:06:47,261
Scott: I'm the president United States.

901
01:06:47,522 --> 01:06:49,210
Scott: the helicopter takes off and that would be the end.

902
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:51,097
Scott: That would be the end of Scott's snow crash.

903
01:06:51,117 --> 01:06:52,884
Rym: Well, you know what diamond age?

904
01:06:52,964 --> 01:07:02,180
Rym: not I'm not gonna spoil diamond age But it did the same thing where it climaxed Awesomely, and then there's another 20 or 30 pages of bullshit.

905
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:02,962
Rym: You don't care about.

906
01:07:03,383 --> 01:07:07,988
Scott: Yeah, he's really got to work on his Demma, what's the word?

907
01:07:09,011 --> 01:07:09,593
Rym: Denim all.

908
01:07:09,733 --> 01:07:11,218
Scott: yes, that's the word.

909
01:07:11,418 --> 01:07:22,341
Rym: However, I'll point out I have not read his very recent work so I don't know if yeah, I have zodiac is on my floor and The Baroque trilogy the three monsters.

910
01:07:22,361 --> 01:07:25,376
Scott: I'm gonna get those someday, you know They're gonna be.

911
01:07:25,396 --> 01:07:26,544
Scott: I'll have a whole life to read them.

912
01:07:26,604 --> 01:07:29,558
Scott: All right, I'm not in a rush So we'll see what the deal is there.

913
01:07:29,638 --> 01:07:32,629
Rym: But well, you realize zodiac was his second work.

914
01:07:33,131 --> 01:07:35,482
Rym: No as it's all that was written in the 80s.

915
01:07:35,744 --> 01:07:36,728
Scott: Well, I'll check it out.

916
01:07:37,191 --> 01:07:41,464
Scott: I'll check it out and I didn't even know the work you wrote before that I've only read parts of.

917
01:07:41,484 --> 01:07:42,814
Scott: in the beginning There was the command line.

918
01:07:42,834 --> 01:07:43,659
Rym: see the thing is I didn't.

919
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:48,170
Rym: I knew that snow crash was his third work But the only work I knew of he wrote before it was zodiac.

920
01:07:48,511 --> 01:07:53,146
Rym: So I just went over to Wikipedia right now and apparently he wrote something called the big you.

921
01:07:53,287 --> 01:07:54,250
Rym: when I was two years old.

922
01:07:54,492 --> 01:07:55,239
Scott: I never heard of that.

923
01:07:55,542 --> 01:08:00,704
Rym: Yeah, but I haven't read Anything he wrote since kryptonomicon which by the way, I didn't read that one anything.

924
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:05,301
Rym: kryptonomicon is great But it is just nerd pornography.

925
01:08:05,521 --> 01:08:07,147
Rym: It is it is there is almost.

926
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:15,355
Rym: the thing is unlike Snow crash which brought forth a lot of prescient interesting ideas kryptonomicon Rehashes well-known ideas.

927
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:18,524
Scott: Well, I did kryptonomicon come out where they will they well-known ideas at the time.

928
01:08:18,624 --> 01:08:18,984
Rym: Yes.

929
01:08:19,587 --> 01:08:21,712
Rym: It was written in 99.

930
01:08:21,712 --> 01:08:29,684
Rym: It's basically talks about cryptography and the thing is if you don't know about Cryptography or about computers like on a really deep hacker level.

931
01:08:30,466 --> 01:08:31,189
Rym: It's a great book.

932
01:08:31,571 --> 01:08:35,185
Scott: Yeah, I mean the PGP stuff went down I think around then or a little before then.

933
01:08:35,245 --> 01:08:51,582
Rym: but if you know about corporate like basically it is pornography in the sense that Kryptonomicon is basically oh my god This is about the kind of corporation that every nerd wants to be a part of The kind of adventure that every nerd wants to have.

934
01:08:51,602 --> 01:08:53,229
Rym: yeah, it's not really like that.

935
01:08:54,111 --> 01:08:56,689
Scott: It's weird because you know, I'm having a hard time.

936
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:59,799
Scott: You know snow crash and diamond age being the main books of his that I've read.

937
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:08,848
Scott: It's like I sort of likes no crashes message, you know a little bit more the whole thing, you know the Tower of Babel metaphor and I like the.

938
01:09:10,292 --> 01:09:17,389
Scott: You know the stylings of snow crash But the actual story of diamond age and the climax and sort of the.

939
01:09:17,408 --> 01:09:18,533
Scott: you know the actual book.

940
01:09:18,573 --> 01:09:19,617
Scott: I sort of like that more.

941
01:09:19,676 --> 01:09:28,089
Rym: so put it this way snow crash is a fun romp nerd porn and It's just a collection of awesome and memorable scenes.

942
01:09:28,814 --> 01:09:32,372
Rym: diamond age has real-world Applicability.

943
01:09:32,653 --> 01:09:33,598
Scott: they die in that.

944
01:09:33,698 --> 01:09:40,505
Rym: if you could do which I think you can What was done on a fundamental level in diamond age in the real world?

945
01:09:40,524 --> 01:09:41,830
Rym: It would change everything.

946
01:09:42,071 --> 01:09:45,890
Rym: I think so - no crash has nothing to say about the real world today.

947
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:49,019
Rym: Basically the its claim to fame in the real world.

948
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:53,554
Rym: is it said what is going to be a long time ago And it was largely right.

949
01:09:53,836 --> 01:09:53,996
Scott: right.

950
01:09:54,015 --> 01:09:57,210
Scott: well isn't that that it was right in this weird almost wrong way?

951
01:09:57,503 --> 01:10:00,079
Scott: Yeah But I mean isn't that what all the great a lot more.

952
01:10:00,139 --> 01:10:02,548
Scott: many of the great science fiction works have in common.

953
01:10:02,588 --> 01:10:02,970
Scott: is that they?

954
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:04,790
Scott: Were right ahead of their time.

955
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:11,331
Scott: You know a whole bunch of science fiction books gets written the future happens the future ends up matching some of them and those ones Are looked at.

956
01:10:11,372 --> 01:10:13,879
Scott: so yes is why 1984 was so great.

957
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:16,547
Scott: It's why brave new world is so great.

958
01:10:16,787 --> 01:10:19,253
Scott: You know is because That's the world.

959
01:10:19,273 --> 01:10:23,391
Scott: well some people would argue that brave new world is the world we live in and not 1984.

960
01:10:23,391 --> 01:10:31,199
Scott: But there are definitely 1984 aspects to the to the modern world and that is Fahrenheit 451. is is because that's what came to be.

961
01:10:31,259 --> 01:10:32,864
Rym: here's why I enjoy diamond age.

962
01:10:32,924 --> 01:10:36,094
Rym: more snow crash is about hey Here's what it's gonna be like.

963
01:10:36,536 --> 01:10:37,399
Rym: diamond age was.

964
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:40,130
Rym: hey you morons do this.

965
01:10:41,192 --> 01:10:44,990
Rym: That is that is definitely true that snow crash doesn't tell you to do anything.

966
01:10:45,976 --> 01:10:48,339
Rym: well Well, you know what tells me to do.

967
01:10:48,359 --> 01:10:50,410
Scott: go go to the hills and become a Buddhist.

968
01:10:52,012 --> 01:10:55,805
Rym: No one does or because I'm already over 25 be uncle Enzo.

969
01:10:55,825 --> 01:10:57,390
Scott: Yeah, I wish I could be uncle.

970
01:10:57,510 --> 01:10:58,251
Rym: Oh my god.

971
01:10:58,311 --> 01:10:58,852
Rym: Is he cool.

972
01:10:59,313 --> 01:10:59,754
Scott: It's weird.

973
01:10:59,794 --> 01:11:03,159
Scott: It's because the book has you know I don't really like.

974
01:11:03,179 --> 01:11:11,580
Rym: oh you know I this is not a spoiler for anything, but Uncle Enzo was a master.

975
01:11:11,982 --> 01:11:13,489
Rym: Raven was a professional.

976
01:11:13,509 --> 01:11:18,254
Rym: oh And that is actually deep If you see.

977
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:24,220
Rym: if you if you've read and seen all the things that we've read and seen No, I haven't even seen a red, but I know what you're talking about.

978
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,203
Scott: Yeah, I get it.

979
01:11:25,805 --> 01:11:26,387
Rym: It's obvious.

980
01:11:26,467 --> 01:11:40,750
Rym: so with any of you Master Keaton is long and kind of slow but if you watch all of master Keaton and you know what a master is and what a professional is then The difference between Raven and uncle Enzo takes on this whole new interesting level.

981
01:11:41,252 --> 01:11:43,906
Scott: I think that is what as another key difference between two books is right.

982
01:11:43,926 --> 01:11:54,922
Scott: when you read a book Generally you want to like the characters in the book The only characters they sort of like and snow crash right or like I like the robot dogs, okay They're not really characters so much.

983
01:11:54,982 --> 01:11:56,070
Rym: I like uncle uncle Enzo.

984
01:11:57,090 --> 01:12:03,934
Rym: Like uncle Enzo I like YT's mom even though I'll say that I like YT too because you know You know what she is.

985
01:12:04,135 --> 01:12:07,754
Rym: she exemplifies one thing and one thing alone Punk kids.

986
01:12:08,438 --> 01:12:10,629
Rym: yeah, she is the good kind of punk kid.

987
01:12:10,871 --> 01:12:15,795
Rym: She is a good kind of punk kid, but you know what she really is and this is the frightening thing She is fortune.

988
01:12:16,156 --> 01:12:16,357
Scott: Yeah.

989
01:12:16,618 --> 01:12:17,924
Scott: She is what that is.

990
01:12:17,944 --> 01:12:20,710
Scott: I don't like her that much though It's not like I'm like a huge fan.

991
01:12:20,831 --> 01:12:23,930
Rym: I'll say I enjoy the scenes with her a lot more than most of the scenes with Hiro.

992
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:26,637
Rym: Yeah, he was no really sort of lay.

993
01:12:26,898 --> 01:12:33,560
Rym: the early scenes with Hiro are great because they're basically you know metaverse hacking blah blah blah But his action scenes all suck.

994
01:12:33,902 --> 01:12:35,650
Rym: YT's action scenes are at least passable.

995
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:40,068
Scott: Yeah, cuz she's got like you know the hovering stuff, and she throws the rope on like the.

996
01:12:40,209 --> 01:12:42,251
Scott: you know That's.

997
01:12:42,552 --> 01:12:55,308
Rym: that is one of the reasons why when someone said Poon you know PWN for the first time in a mega TF match I was in we all pronounced it Poon and in retrospect Poon Poon this book.

998
01:12:55,348 --> 01:12:57,623
Rym: there may be a Some sort of correlation.

999
01:12:57,643 --> 01:12:58,470
Scott: I think you're stretching it.

1000
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:02,066
Rym: I don't think I made that correlation, but I think someone out there did.

1001
01:13:02,146 --> 01:13:03,090
Scott: I think you're stretching it Cuz.

1002
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:09,956
Rym: I know is that far all the people who use the word Poon in the quake one in quake two FPS and days say Poon.

1003
01:13:09,976 --> 01:13:13,389
Rym: to this day everyone who started using it recently says Poon.

1004
01:13:13,993 --> 01:13:16,770
Rym: Yeah, you can tell how old someone is by how they pronounce that way.

1005
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:18,517
Scott: I don't think that's in any way related to snow crash.

1006
01:13:18,557 --> 01:13:21,850
Scott: for the fact that snow, but it's your linguistic programming.

1007
01:13:24,827 --> 01:13:25,858
Rym: I Think we're done.

1008
01:13:25,999 --> 01:13:27,370
Rym: unless we start getting into the minutia.

1009
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:30,070
Rym: I mean, I don't I don't think you want to hear me talk about one minutia.

1010
01:13:30,130 --> 01:13:31,175
Scott: I want to talk about which is.

1011
01:13:31,196 --> 01:13:33,145
Scott: you know how he sort of relates.

1012
01:13:33,185 --> 01:13:34,150
Scott: You know okay?

1013
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:44,281
Scott: It was the Tower of Babel right BABEL, but also BABB le That that's not pretty crash what that's old anyway.

1014
01:13:44,581 --> 01:13:47,910
Scott: I know but that you know, but it's just pointing that out.

1015
01:13:48,011 --> 01:13:51,334
Scott: It's sort of like you don't need to do that It's just sort of.

1016
01:13:51,474 --> 01:13:53,502
Scott: it was a little painful when they actually it's like.

1017
01:13:54,264 --> 01:13:55,730
Scott: it's like the thing you're not supposed to say.

1018
01:13:56,294 --> 01:13:59,755
Scott: You know how it's like whether it's an obvious comparison And you've made it and you succeeded.

1019
01:14:00,077 --> 01:14:03,390
Scott: and then you make you like you compare two words and make a bad pun.

1020
01:14:03,731 --> 01:14:04,734
Scott: That's sort of what that was.

1021
01:14:04,795 --> 01:14:05,256
Scott: no so like.

1022
01:14:05,637 --> 01:14:06,781
Scott: ah yeah, well.

1023
01:14:06,821 --> 01:14:09,450
Scott: It's like no don't say that you would set it up already.

1024
01:14:09,874 --> 01:14:26,409
Rym: I can say one thing though The way the book ends while it is incredibly Dissatisfying and anticlimactic and just kind of Peters off and then ends basically the end of the book as I point out is Everybody you know all the punk kids the the couriers that kind of saved the day.

1025
01:14:27,032 --> 01:14:31,270
Rym: I'll get bored and wander off after you know like up all right whatever and they just kind of wander away.

1026
01:14:32,013 --> 01:14:39,130
Rym: And then YT is like like she does all this crazy stuff like she's had all these adventures And she's basically saved the world and all the blah blah blah.

1027
01:14:39,931 --> 01:14:45,419
Rym: And then as soon as the action dies down even a little bit She gets bored and just wanders away.

1028
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:51,410
Rym: and that kind of epitomizes the the current General the generation after us on the internet.

1029
01:14:52,153 --> 01:14:52,876
Rym: Get bored.

1030
01:14:52,956 --> 01:14:55,968
Rym: wander away is like the rallying call of the internet.

1031
01:14:55,988 --> 01:15:02,429
Rym: today It most definitely is and I don't know if that was intentional or if he just doesn't know how to end a goddamn book.

1032
01:15:03,514 --> 01:15:04,301
Scott: I don't know it.

1033
01:15:04,402 --> 01:15:07,239
Scott: You know if you It's it.

1034
01:15:07,501 --> 01:15:13,013
Scott: without interviewing Stevenson It'd be hard to tell how much of it is throw shit against the wall And how much of it is.

1035
01:15:13,374 --> 01:15:17,347
Scott: recognize things people are already thinking and figure out what they're gonna think next.

1036
01:15:17,548 --> 01:15:21,648
Scott: or you know just match up with things people already thinking or I don't know.

1037
01:15:21,728 --> 01:15:23,593
Scott: but There is there.

1038
01:15:23,633 --> 01:15:31,917
Scott: definitely I can't not believe that there isn't definitely a significant element of throw shit against the wall And some of it's gonna match and some of it's not this.

1039
01:15:31,957 --> 01:15:39,110
Scott: definitely that's going on All right, so actually there's a little tiny problem with the next book, but I'm not changing my mind.

1040
01:15:40,892 --> 01:15:42,658
Scott: I tried to think of a book right.

1041
01:15:42,698 --> 01:15:44,905
Scott: that would be really good because we're not gonna.

1042
01:15:44,926 --> 01:15:48,099
Scott: We're not going with bad books here We're only doing top quality.

1043
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:48,522
Scott: all right.

1044
01:15:48,582 --> 01:15:50,170
Scott: We don't give you no poop here at GeekNights.

1045
01:15:50,392 --> 01:15:52,730
Rym: So as a result the next book is Ethan Frome.

1046
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:57,673
Scott: It's not Ethan from.

1047
01:15:57,713 --> 01:15:58,676
Scott: Ethan Frome is terrible.

1048
01:15:58,936 --> 01:16:00,280
Scott: anyone says otherwise it's stupid.

1049
01:16:00,801 --> 01:16:03,468
Scott: um it goes down his sled and hurts himself.

1050
01:16:03,488 --> 01:16:09,470
Scott: the end Okay.

1051
01:16:10,431 --> 01:16:17,280
Scott: So I tried to think of a book right because you've also had a problem with people not Reading or not wanting to read or being unable to read.

1052
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:23,087
Rym: yes as much as I want the next book to be the count of Monte Cristo, I think one of you will read that.

1053
01:16:23,228 --> 01:16:29,950
Scott: yeah, I mean Reading the entire count of Monte Cristo is equivalent to reading all three Prince of Nothing books and people had trouble reading the one.

1054
01:16:30,111 --> 01:16:43,028
Scott: So I'm not gonna dump that on you, so I dare to think what's a really good book That is easy to read maybe shorter right yet Still has substance to it, and it's not like c-spot run right cuz I mean we could throw some dr.

1055
01:16:43,048 --> 01:16:43,530
Scott: Seuss out there.

1056
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:46,699
Scott: That's pretty good, but it really wouldn't be a lot of episode.

1057
01:16:46,739 --> 01:16:48,966
Scott: I mean oh man wasn't it great?

1058
01:16:48,986 --> 01:16:52,212
Scott: when there are two fish How about?

1059
01:16:52,513 --> 01:16:53,657
Rym: I'm all about blue fish.

1060
01:16:54,178 --> 01:16:54,399
Scott: No.

1061
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:56,105
Scott: I think you're all about hopping on pop.

1062
01:16:56,646 --> 01:16:57,610
Rym: Hop on pop is good.

1063
01:16:59,131 --> 01:16:59,854
Scott: You missed my joke.

1064
01:16:59,894 --> 01:17:01,801
Rym: I saw your joke and I went right past it.

1065
01:17:01,962 --> 01:17:03,488
Scott: actually about the Lorax is the wind.

1066
01:17:03,508 --> 01:17:07,264
Scott: but anyway The book we're gonna do all right is.

1067
01:17:07,405 --> 01:17:08,652
Scott: I think it's a good choice I made.

1068
01:17:08,672 --> 01:17:12,710
Scott: the choice is a Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K Le Guin.

1069
01:17:12,771 --> 01:17:14,082
Scott: It's a fantasy book right.

1070
01:17:14,102 --> 01:17:14,989
Scott: you've probably heard of it.

1071
01:17:15,050 --> 01:17:21,308
Scott: There was a recent Studio Ghibli movie based on it right pretty important fantasy book from the late 60s.

1072
01:17:22,111 --> 01:17:28,910
Scott: But it's a book that really the reading level of it I could have read it in you know maybe sixth seventh grade.

1073
01:17:28,990 --> 01:17:35,070
Scott: This is you know is the book perhaps on the same reading level is something like Lord of the Flies.

1074
01:17:35,130 --> 01:17:36,807
Scott: You know it's sort of that level of reading.

1075
01:17:36,928 --> 01:17:39,680
Scott: so Really everyone should be able to read it.

1076
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:41,570
Scott: You know it shouldn't take you that long.

1077
01:17:41,610 --> 01:17:44,924
Scott: It's a book that I could read probably in a few hours.

1078
01:17:45,045 --> 01:17:46,230
Scott: It's not difficult at all.

1079
01:17:46,470 --> 01:17:51,186
Scott: I'm only gonna do volume one of it right and volume one is a complete story.

1080
01:17:51,447 --> 01:17:52,752
Scott: if you like it a lot You can go and get.

1081
01:17:52,792 --> 01:17:56,630
Scott: other are the other Earthsea books which sort of directly continue the story.

1082
01:17:57,731 --> 01:17:59,555
Scott: All I'll say about Earthsea right the.

1083
01:17:59,615 --> 01:18:06,788
Scott: the one thing I want to tell about right now is When you read a lot of fantasy novels right Lord of the Rings prince of nothing.

1084
01:18:06,969 --> 01:18:09,037
Scott: right now I'm reading Thomas Covenant.

1085
01:18:09,218 --> 01:18:10,382
Scott: right what not?

1086
01:18:10,523 --> 01:18:11,768
Scott: white gold-wielding and such.

1087
01:18:12,029 --> 01:18:12,210
Scott: right.

1088
01:18:13,057 --> 01:18:18,220
Scott: There was always you know There's the current epic quest going on or whatever something like that.

1089
01:18:18,561 --> 01:18:25,766
Scott: and there was always in the past right some Even greater quest that set the stage of the current world.

1090
01:18:25,947 --> 01:18:26,810
Scott: right Lord of the Rings?

1091
01:18:26,930 --> 01:18:30,500
Scott: Okay, the Silmarillion set the stage of the Middle Earth that you're.

1092
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,144
Scott: you know that Frodo is in.

1093
01:18:32,485 --> 01:18:36,677
Scott: you know the great battles of The gods and everything happened in the past.

1094
01:18:36,717 --> 01:18:42,193
Scott: and I always say I want to see those great battles of the gods with a million Dragons everywhere.

1095
01:18:42,233 --> 01:18:43,276
Scott: how can we never see those?

1096
01:18:43,316 --> 01:18:47,369
Scott: and the reason is because it's boring from a you know a book perspective.

1097
01:18:47,389 --> 01:19:06,767
Scott: in Earthsea there is the great past with the dragons and all that stuff right to build the world upon but as it turns out the story that happens in that first book of Earthsea is Is Even if you don't realize it the stage-setter, it's actually like oh my god.

1098
01:19:06,847 --> 01:19:07,670
Scott: This is it.

1099
01:19:07,770 --> 01:19:16,477
Scott: It's the business and that's that really gives me a strong feeling about that book and it's significant in Many recent geek things.

1100
01:19:16,858 --> 01:19:18,142
Scott: it's an important fantasy work.

1101
01:19:18,242 --> 01:19:18,844
Scott: You should read it.

1102
01:19:19,385 --> 01:19:19,987
Scott: It's easy.

1103
01:19:20,027 --> 01:19:20,890
Scott: It's also cheap.

1104
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:22,401
Scott: Let me go look how much it is on Amazon.

1105
01:19:22,421 --> 01:19:26,022
Scott: while Rym says something Or all Rym doesn't say anything.

1106
01:19:26,565 --> 01:19:27,411
Rym: well pretty much I mean.

1107
01:19:27,431 --> 01:19:35,203
Rym: the way we're doing this in the future is that Scott and I are gonna take turns picking books with Unilateral and uncontestable power are we?

1108
01:19:35,283 --> 01:19:36,027
Scott: oh is that how we're gonna.

1109
01:19:36,067 --> 01:19:37,052
Rym: Do that's how we're gonna Do it.

1110
01:19:37,253 --> 01:19:38,984
Scott: see I gave you a chance to.

1111
01:19:39,004 --> 01:19:42,285
Scott: you know cuz I picked it out And I don't you you had a chance to say so.

1112
01:19:42,346 --> 01:19:46,310
Rym: I will say this I will not abuse this until you do so as long as we play civil.

1113
01:19:46,471 --> 01:19:47,538
Scott: Oh is that how we're gonna.

1114
01:19:47,578 --> 01:19:59,798
Rym: Do it is we're each gonna basically say Okay, yes, so basically if one of us defects like if I pick the brothers or Crime and punishment That's actually a good book.

1115
01:19:59,899 --> 01:20:04,240
Rym: Yeah, not as good as crime and punishment Or the kind of Monte Cristo.

1116
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:04,441
Rym: there.

1117
01:20:04,461 --> 01:20:05,870
Rym: Scott can hit me back with Ethan Frome.

1118
01:20:06,350 --> 01:20:07,541
Scott: I'm not gonna hit you back from.

1119
01:20:07,581 --> 01:20:08,610
Scott: Ethan Frome takes five minutes.

1120
01:20:09,974 --> 01:20:13,686
Scott: I would hit you back with something far worse than you can possibly imagine.

1121
01:20:13,706 --> 01:20:14,890
Rym: you strike me down now.

1122
01:20:15,030 --> 01:20:21,150
Scott: Wizard of Earthsea is ten dollars and twenty cents on Amazon, and it's really it won't take you long.

1123
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:24,490
Scott: I mean seriously you could watch that you've reading.

1124
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:28,789
Scott: This would take you less time than watching an anime series all right.

1125
01:20:29,704 --> 01:20:31,865
