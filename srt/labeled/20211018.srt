1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,128
Rym: It's Monday, October 18th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,128 --> 00:00:09,349
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:13,160
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,645
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,685 --> 00:00:18,779
Rym: Tonight we're talking about upgrading and migrating operating systems.

6
00:00:20,181 --> 00:00:21,218
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,661 --> 00:00:26,240
Rym: So, uh, I haven't actually worn a Halloween costume in a long time.

8
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:29,280
Rym: For a bunch of reasons, not the least of which, there's been a pandemic.

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,360
Rym: It's not like I'm going to Halloween parties.

10
00:00:32,981 --> 00:00:44,060
Rym: So, uh, we might, if we do a little small Halloween gathering of our friends in the city, I do have the necessary materials to wear a costume that I've threatened to wear for a very long time.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,394
Rym: And I'm moderately excited about dressing up again.

12
00:00:46,434 --> 00:00:47,119
Rym: It's been too long.

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,920
Rym: My main regret is that I cannot go somewhere in public to inflict this costume upon just members of the public at large.

14
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,659
Rym: I can only inflict it upon all of you who will probably see pictures of me as a result of this.

15
00:01:00,082 --> 00:01:00,345
Rym: All right.

16
00:01:00,385 --> 00:01:02,060
Rym: So, uh, you got any news on this Monday?

17
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:04,643
Scott: Uh, yeah.

18
00:01:04,904 --> 00:01:12,039
Scott: Tim Apple graced us with an Apple event on Monday right before our show, making life real easy for us over here.

19
00:01:13,722 --> 00:01:15,427
Scott: It wasn't a very big Apple event.

20
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,916
Scott: I was hoping, I knew there was going to be MacBooks.

21
00:01:17,976 --> 00:01:18,939
Scott: Everyone knew that, right?

22
00:01:19,841 --> 00:01:24,272
Scott: I was hoping for some AirPods Pro 2.

23
00:01:24,272 --> 00:01:27,500
Scott: Instead, we got regular AirPods version 3.

24
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,588
Scott: So regular AirPods version 3 did get a nice upgrade.

25
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:41,376
Scott: If I was not living in a loud place, or if I didn't value my hearing, I would be willing to get regular AirPods 3.

26
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,120
Scott: They seem pretty good.

27
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:47,760
Rym: I guess I wouldn't still, because the only time I could ever imagine putting on headphones is when I want isolation.

28
00:01:47,961 --> 00:01:52,280
Rym: I don't really listen to stuff on the go when I also have to hear the real world around me.

29
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,259
Rym: Like pretty much ever.

30
00:01:56,881 --> 00:02:02,320
Scott: So, for example, my main using right now would be when I'm riding my bike inside.

31
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,815
Rym: Ah, see, if I'm riding my bike inside, I just use actual speakers.

32
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:06,700
Rym: I don't even wear headphones.

33
00:02:07,902 --> 00:02:09,279
Scott: There's another human being here.

34
00:02:09,621 --> 00:02:10,497
Rym: Yeah, I got that too.

35
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:11,820
Scott: Who's sleeping.

36
00:02:12,602 --> 00:02:13,792
Rym: Oh, yeah, I guess the sleeping thing.

37
00:02:13,812 --> 00:02:14,720
Rym: We don't have that kind of problem.

38
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,839
Rym: I can be in one room, loudly riding the bike and watching something, and Emily can be in the other room working on stuff, and they don't really intersect with each other.

39
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:24,261
Scott: Right.

40
00:02:24,322 --> 00:02:38,967
Scott: Also, you could be, for example, maybe the other person is awake, and you're just watching a movie on the couch, and the other person is just around, but they don't want to hear your movie that you're watching on the couch without them, so a wireless headphone is good.

41
00:02:38,987 --> 00:02:42,699
Scott: You could use a wired headphone, but you've got a wire going all the way over to the HDPC?

42
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:44,099
Scott: What are you doing?

43
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,329
Rym: I mean, I've thought about that use case.

44
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:59,578
Rym: I thought about that a lot when we first set up the apartment, because one of the soundbars I was looking at had just like a wireless headphone receiver thing in it, but in practice, I've just never actually needed that capability at any point in my life, and I still don't.

45
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,485
Scott: But I do have these, right?

46
00:03:02,505 --> 00:03:03,368
Scott: So these are wireless.

47
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:05,033
Scott: These are Bluetooth.

48
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:07,280
Scott: They're great, and they're noise-canceling and everything.

49
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,651
Scott: The problem is these, A, get kind of greasy, right?

50
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:17,200
Scott: You can wear them for hours and hours, but not that many hours.

51
00:03:17,382 --> 00:03:18,978
Rym: So what I do have, but not for home.

52
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:35,554
Scott: And the other thing is that the noise-canceling, the active noise-canceling, you sort of have to release the air every once in a while, and you're obviously not going to wear these biking in one place, right?

53
00:03:35,614 --> 00:03:37,340
Scott: That would be the worst with this kind of headphone.

54
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,879
Rym: See, what I actually have, not for when I'm in the apartment...

55
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,691
Scott: They're also not great in bed, because I put these on in bed.

56
00:03:43,732 --> 00:03:44,937
Scott: If I'm sitting up, that's fine.

57
00:03:44,977 --> 00:03:45,660
Scott: In bed, perfect.

58
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:49,616
Scott: But I want to lay down on my side in bed, that's...

59
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:51,945
Rym: Ah, see, my magic.

60
00:03:51,985 --> 00:03:53,210
Rym: That's where the use cases differ.

61
00:03:53,571 --> 00:03:54,997
Rym: I don't ever lay on my side, really.

62
00:03:55,037 --> 00:03:55,298
Rym: I'm 100% fine.

63
00:03:56,763 --> 00:04:01,719
Scott: Even if you lay down on your back, these lying straight down as opposed to sitting up are kind of meh.

64
00:04:02,961 --> 00:04:04,817
Scott: You're going to hold the screen up in front of you.

65
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:06,857
Rym: I guess I've never worn...

66
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,976
Scott: Hold your iPad in the air with two arms straight up into the air.

67
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:10,720
Scott: Your arms get tired.

68
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:17,238
Rym: I don't think I've ever in my life worn a pair of headphones in bed since middle school, when I would listen to...

69
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,579
Scott: Mount your screen on the ceiling so you can lay down and look straight up at it?

70
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:30,040
Rym: In middle school, I would listen to a cassette player while I was laying in bed, listening to music at night, with just regular-ass Walkman headphones.

71
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,467
Rym: I had a pillow speaker at one point.

72
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,660
Rym: Every pillow speaker on Earth is not actually that good.

73
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:39,553
Scott: It was a piece of shit for five bucks from Radio Shack.

74
00:04:39,593 --> 00:04:40,517
Scott: It sounded like garbage.

75
00:04:40,557 --> 00:04:41,100
Scott: It was mono.

76
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,856
Scott: But if you listen to AM radio, it's fine.

77
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,740
Rym: But those headphones I would wear laying in bed as a teenager?

78
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:52,360
Rym: Yeah, those things were just mangled beyond recognition by the fact that I wore them in bed.

79
00:04:53,723 --> 00:04:55,200
Rym: They were bent and twisted.

80
00:04:57,102 --> 00:04:59,800
Scott: Yeah, so it's good to have a big headphone and a small headphone.

81
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,313
Scott: And right now, I do have a small headphone.

82
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,239
Scott: that's perfectly fine.

83
00:05:04,107 --> 00:05:05,359
Scott: And it's wireless, too.

84
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,457
Scott: But the problem is, it's wireless with a little cable that goes behind the neck.

85
00:05:10,497 --> 00:05:11,320
Scott: that's sort of annoying.

86
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,439
Scott: And also, because it's not Apple, I have mostly Apple devices that I'm connecting it to.

87
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,180
Scott: It doesn't connect and disconnect so elegantly.

88
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,870
Rym: I gotta say, it seems like the primary.

89
00:05:25,564 --> 00:05:27,300
Scott: So I end up using it wired mostly.

90
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,319
Scott: I just took the Bluetooth wire off and I attached the wire wire.

91
00:05:31,882 --> 00:05:35,460
Scott: But then, you're biking in place and you've got this wire flapping around.

92
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:45,640
Rym: It seems like the magic of the AirPods in general is just that if you've got multiple Apple devices in particular, they just work with everything all the time.

93
00:05:47,528 --> 00:05:49,500
Scott: This just works with everything all the time, actually.

94
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:56,120
Scott: The only problem with this one, the Bose one, is it can only connect to two devices at once.

95
00:05:56,821 --> 00:06:07,639
Scott: So if you have a third device and you want to switch, you either have to make sure that one of the other two devices is off off so that it picks up the third one.

96
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:15,160
Scott: Or you have to go to the iPhone app and choose the devices, tell it which ones, which is slightly annoying.

97
00:06:17,101 --> 00:06:21,720
Rym: Let's see, there was an update about the Apple Music voice plan, but I don't think either of us would.

98
00:06:22,605 --> 00:06:23,360
Scott: That's a weird one.

99
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:28,940
Scott: It's basically like, hey, you want Apple Music, but you don't want to pay so much for it.

100
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:36,680
Scott: If you agree to only interface with Apple Music via Siri and not using any other interface, we'll charge you less money.

101
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:38,948
Scott: It's so weird.

102
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:41,760
Rym: I think we might have similar guesses as to why this even exists.

103
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,360
Scott: They want more people to use Siri.

104
00:06:44,142 --> 00:06:47,300
Scott: And they collect more Siri, you know, no one's using Siri.

105
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,900
Scott: So they're like, hey, maybe this will convince people to use Siri.

106
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,358
Scott: You buy this cheap Apple Music plan for five bucks, the cheapest music plan there is.

107
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:59,800
Scott: But the only way to listen to that music is to talk to Siri on whatever device.

108
00:07:00,442 --> 00:07:10,060
Scott: And if you're mostly using Siri, you know, in your home with HomePods or whatever you got, then that might be the only way you ever interface with Apple Music and then you'll save yourself five bucks a month.

109
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:17,180
Rym: And I'll bet it's a combination of that and trying to get telemetry data to make Siri better or to make their music thing better in some way.

110
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,827
Rym: But yeah, I think it's very.

111
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:24,620
Rym: they're telling on themselves that people don't really use Siri that much, I think, no matter what with this.

112
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,528
Scott: It's very strange.

113
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:26,639
Scott: It's a very strange thing.

114
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,718
Scott: Also, that's kind of a bigger picture.

115
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:31,160
Scott: Right.

116
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:41,000
Scott: You know, there's still an ongoing drama with regards to, you know, the music industry and the streaming companies, Spotify, Apple, everybody.

117
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,304
Scott: Right.

118
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:45,660
Scott: In that they're not paying enough per song.

119
00:07:45,941 --> 00:07:46,322
Scott: Right.

120
00:07:47,586 --> 00:07:50,274
Scott: And but the problem is, is that what are you going to do?

121
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:51,257
Scott: Charge users more?

122
00:07:51,397 --> 00:07:52,260
Scott: Users won't pay more.

123
00:07:52,861 --> 00:07:53,061
Rym: Yeah.

124
00:07:53,142 --> 00:07:56,995
Rym: I mean, I remember we only have twenty dollars CDs.

125
00:07:57,056 --> 00:07:57,517
Rym: And guess what?

126
00:07:57,557 --> 00:07:58,300
Rym: I just didn't bother.

127
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,443
Rym: I would pirate stuff.

128
00:07:59,483 --> 00:08:06,360
Rym: And frankly, even though I love music, if I couldn't pirate stuff and I couldn't get it cheaply, I just didn't really seek out music anymore.

129
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:07,222
Scott: Yeah.

130
00:08:07,282 --> 00:08:11,960
Scott: So it's like the the the only place that money can come from is the margins from Spotify.

131
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,799
Scott: Spotify and Apple's margins are the only place that money can come from.

132
00:08:15,422 --> 00:08:18,998
Scott: The only alternative would be, all right, music people, go make your own streaming service.

133
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,599
Scott: You see what you charge for it and see how good it is and see how many people use it.

134
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:24,922
Scott: Right.

135
00:08:24,943 --> 00:08:26,530
Rym: This gets back into that broader topic.

136
00:08:26,551 --> 00:08:28,440
Rym: we've talked about a lot where all media.

137
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,827
Rym: But let's talk about music for a second.

138
00:08:30,491 --> 00:08:32,179
Rym: All music, it's worth less.

139
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,320
Rym: Partly because it's not worthless, but worth space less like Planetarium.

140
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:38,942
Scott: It used to be.

141
00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:50,420
Rym: But it's competing with all the music that any human has ever made because it's all just available pretty much everywhere now, coupled with all the actually free music that people are making.

142
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:57,600
Rym: I mean, look at how many of those something kind of beats to something to channels have just proliferated out in the world.

143
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,130
Rym: And a lot of people I've seen a lot of like younger like Zenniel type kids.

144
00:09:01,772 --> 00:09:03,095
Rym: That's the music they listen to.

145
00:09:03,236 --> 00:09:04,700
Rym: They listen to like whatever's on YouTube.

146
00:09:05,661 --> 00:09:05,821
Scott: Yeah.

147
00:09:06,302 --> 00:09:07,345
Scott: I mean, think about it like this.

148
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:07,565
Scott: Right.

149
00:09:07,605 --> 00:09:13,620
Scott: Let's say somebody hand crafts like a wooden toy of some kind.

150
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,161
Scott: Right.

151
00:09:14,201 --> 00:09:15,706
Scott: Like they whittle it down.

152
00:09:15,726 --> 00:09:19,358
Scott: It's like a beautiful handcrafted wooden toy.

153
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:19,860
Scott: Right.

154
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,964
Scott: And it's like that person worked fucking hard.

155
00:09:22,324 --> 00:09:30,240
Scott: And if someone wants that toy for themselves or to even play with it for an amount of time, they deserve to be paid for that hard and beautiful work.

156
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:30,601
Scott: Right.

157
00:09:31,182 --> 00:09:39,356
Scott: But now imagine the world is filled with millions and millions of people who are all crafting beautiful wooden toys.

158
00:09:39,377 --> 00:09:40,278
Scott: and they don't.

159
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:41,200
Scott: they never wear out.

160
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:43,125
Scott: They could be infinitely copied.

161
00:09:43,607 --> 00:09:44,469
Scott: They're just everywhere.

162
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,991
Scott: Right.

163
00:09:45,011 --> 00:09:46,515
Scott: We're just buried in the fucking things.

164
00:09:47,137 --> 00:09:47,337
Scott: Right.

165
00:09:47,397 --> 00:09:48,320
Scott: They're all amazing.

166
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,991
Scott: All these songwriters working very hard, spending hours crafting songs.

167
00:09:53,452 --> 00:09:56,880
Scott: that are all, you know, musicians playing the songs very well.

168
00:09:57,401 --> 00:09:57,642
Scott: Right.

169
00:09:57,762 --> 00:10:01,030
Scott: All this beautifully crafted, amazing musical work everywhere.

170
00:10:01,331 --> 00:10:05,140
Scott: But there's just so fucking much of it that it's like, yeah, you work.

171
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:11,514
Scott: If you think about it in terms of just one, it's like, yeah, you deserve more for this amazing work that you've created.

172
00:10:11,815 --> 00:10:13,840
Scott: But there's just so fucking much.

173
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,804
Rym: Well, this gets into this fundamental.

174
00:10:16,305 --> 00:10:22,960
Rym: I've touched on this a few times in recent episodes, but this idea of value based pricing versus cost based pricing.

175
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,163
Rym: There's two fundamental ways to price something.

176
00:10:25,183 --> 00:10:36,160
Rym: You price it based on how much it costs to make it and or maintain it like being available, or you price based on how much value the people who consume it get out of it.

177
00:10:36,521 --> 00:10:41,900
Rym: And the problem is the incremental value most people get out of music is infinitely small.

178
00:10:42,581 --> 00:10:48,227
Rym: Yet the cost of making music, while it has decreased significantly, varies widely.

179
00:10:48,788 --> 00:10:58,820
Rym: And a lot of music, even that's made for "free" and even made available for "free" still costs human labor, even if that person happens to be willing to do it for free.

180
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,779
Rym: Neither one of these models covers the modern world of how music is made and how music is listened to.

181
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:07,106
Scott: All right, so there's that.

182
00:11:07,146 --> 00:11:10,072
Scott: and the final thing, of course, the big one, new MacBooks, right?

183
00:11:10,132 --> 00:11:13,139
Scott: They didn't come up with M2 chips, but they got M1 Pro and M1 Max.

184
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,268
Rym: You want to pay what?

185
00:11:15,268 --> 00:11:17,400
Rym: 400 bucks to get a little more storage in that thing?

186
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:18,480
Scott: Right.

187
00:11:18,581 --> 00:11:22,428
Scott: So, you know, the base level does seem powerful enough on all the models.

188
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:23,870
Scott: You can pay for.

189
00:11:24,271 --> 00:11:29,982
Scott: if you get the max, you could pay $400 to get up to 64 gigs of RAM instead of 32.

190
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:36,479
Scott: You can also go down to 16 if you don't need the 32, which I think is actually 16 is probably actually reasonable for most people.

191
00:11:37,762 --> 00:11:38,769
Rym: Yeah, unless you're running a lot of...

192
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,740
Scott: Yeah, my desktop has said 32 for a long ass time, like maybe a decade possibly or more.

193
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:53,220
Scott: And I have never once swapped, no matter what I've thrown at it, you know, Adobe Premiere stuff, games...

194
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,171
Rym: You know what causes me to swap with 32?

195
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:56,739
Rym: There's one and only one thing.

196
00:11:57,362 --> 00:12:00,051
Rym: Warp stabilization on a clip.

197
00:12:00,111 --> 00:12:02,379
Rym: that's longer than a trivial amount of time.

198
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,326
Scott: But like I've done 4K stuff.

199
00:12:05,406 --> 00:12:09,060
Scott: It's like nothing has made me use all 32 gigs of RAM ever.

200
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:18,381
Scott: So I don't really, unless you are working at like an actual pro place, there's no reason to spend $400 to get a 64.

201
00:12:18,381 --> 00:12:21,148
Scott: That $400 isn't for 64 gigs of RAM.

202
00:12:21,228 --> 00:12:24,676
Scott: It's for 32 gigs of RAM because you start with the 32.

203
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:25,237
Scott: You're paying 400 for 32 more.

204
00:12:27,302 --> 00:12:34,458
Scott: You can go on Newegg and get 64 gigs of laptop RAM for two to three, maybe $400 at most.

205
00:12:35,901 --> 00:12:44,640
Scott: So they're double... Apple is charging 2x more than 2x the retail cost for that RAM, which is what Apple always does.

206
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,984
Scott: They always overcharge for RAM.

207
00:12:46,286 --> 00:12:50,140
Scott: But regardless, it seems like they've done what people wanted.

208
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,671
Scott: They made a really, really powerful MacBook with a crazy good screen.

209
00:12:55,413 --> 00:13:00,308
Scott: They got rid of that bar that nobody liked and really cared about, basically admitting that it was useless.

210
00:13:00,348 --> 00:13:02,860
Scott: They got the better keyboard on there that people like better.

211
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,725
Scott: You know, I don't like it, but other people like it.

212
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,877
Scott: And yeah, they added all the ports.

213
00:13:08,937 --> 00:13:09,920
Scott: It's not just USB-C.

214
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,570
Scott: All the ports you want are on there.

215
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,840
Scott: They got HDMI on the side.

216
00:13:13,341 --> 00:13:15,856
Rym: Oh, isn't it a full-size HDMI slot too?

217
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:16,560
Rym: Like it's just real?

218
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:16,881
Rym: Yep.

219
00:13:17,383 --> 00:13:18,648
Scott: Full-size HDMI.

220
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:20,033
Scott: They're basically like, "Yeah, all

221
00:13:20,073 --> 00:13:20,193
Scott: right.".

222
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:21,920
Scott: They're giving the pros what they want.

223
00:13:22,641 --> 00:13:26,289
Scott: What they've sacrificed is basically size.

224
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:28,474
Scott: They used to offer 13 and 15 inch.

225
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,258
Scott: Now they're offering 14 and 16 inch.

226
00:13:32,262 --> 00:13:33,145
Scott: So it's bigger.

227
00:13:33,385 --> 00:13:37,459
Scott: Also, if you look at it, you can just tell the bottom half of it is thick.

228
00:13:38,981 --> 00:13:41,127
Scott: It is thicker and it's like half a pound heavier.

229
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:46,080
Scott: They went on and on about, "Oh, it's more efficient," which is true.

230
00:13:47,241 --> 00:14:07,613
Scott: In terms of like, if you're looking at the ratio between how much electricity this thing uses versus how powerful it is and compare it to like a Windows Intel gaming laptop or something, or even a gaming desktop, or even an Nvidia 3080, you get more performance per watt from these than you will from those.

231
00:14:08,716 --> 00:14:09,940
Scott: Apple is winning on that front.

232
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,385
Rym: Well, caveat here.

233
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:14,240
Rym: You're not going to play a game on it still because it's a Mac.

234
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:15,564
Scott: Because it's a Mac.

235
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,029
Scott: You could play a game on it.

236
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:22,748
Scott: It has the power to do a game, but it doesn't have the... It has OS X. So it's like, "What game are you going to

237
00:14:22,768 --> 00:14:23,009
Scott: play?"

238
00:14:23,751 --> 00:14:24,394
Scott: Right?

239
00:14:24,414 --> 00:14:26,100
Scott: Well, not OS X. It's Mac OS now.

240
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:46,560
Scott: But also, given that an Nvidia 3080, 3090, the maximum power, if you get the best PC you could possibly get, if you ignore efficiency, yeah, this is not going to be as powerful as the PC at the highest output.

241
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:54,940
Scott: It's like there's more total horsepower in the PC, even if you have to use gallons and gallons of fuel to get to that horsepower.

242
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:55,540
Rym: Yeah.

243
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:02,500
Rym: Now it looks like they can also... You can now get them with the two newer M1 chips, the Pro and the Max.

244
00:15:03,162 --> 00:15:05,028
Scott: Yeah, we talked about that already.

245
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,094
Scott: So they didn't make M2.

246
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,900
Scott: They just made M1 Pro and M1 Max.

247
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,140
Rym: I'm looking for a benchmark on how these things actually perform with video editing.

248
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,539
Rym: Because it seems like people have mostly talked about Final Cut.

249
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:18,761
Scott: Right.

250
00:15:18,781 --> 00:15:19,844
Scott: So that's the thing.

251
00:15:19,984 --> 00:15:26,000
Scott: All of their software now, they finally got... All Apple software is now optimized for these chips.

252
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,501
Scott: Right.

253
00:15:26,581 --> 00:15:29,549
Scott: So they're going to run natively and be ridiculously fast.

254
00:15:30,251 --> 00:15:33,540
Scott: Adobe is updating or has updated most of its stuff.

255
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:51,980
Scott: But I get the feeling that if you just care about how long a render takes or how smooth... Forgetting the other factors and differences between Final Cut and Premiere or any other two equivalent production apps, you're going to get more performance out of the Final Cut one in terms of how fast it is and whatnot.

256
00:15:52,060 --> 00:16:02,120
Scott: Because it's... And even if Adobe updates their shit, I don't think they'll be able to... I mean, they've never really approached even on the Intel Max, right?

257
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:13,760
Rym: Of course, also, it'll really depend on if you're using a laptop, most of your use cases, you can't be worried that much about render time, as long as it's within a reasonable boundary for the kind of workflow you've got.

258
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,060
Rym: Because anyone who really cares about render times has a workstation anyway.

259
00:16:17,762 --> 00:16:26,060
Scott: Well, I think that's the thing is that this thing is quite powerful in such that you're either A, you're actually a mobile professional.

260
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,227
Scott: Those people do exist.

261
00:16:27,267 --> 00:16:28,073
Scott: How many are there?

262
00:16:28,093 --> 00:16:29,060
Scott: I don't know, right?

263
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,120
Scott: But you're out and about while you're doing work that needs serious power.

264
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,920
Scott: And this thing is big and heavy because they put a big old battery in there.

265
00:16:36,101 --> 00:16:41,620
Scott: So it's going to last long enough until you have to change the non-user replaceable battery.

266
00:16:42,641 --> 00:16:48,038
Scott: Or B, I think a lot of people these days, they just put the laptop on the desk, right?

267
00:16:48,058 --> 00:16:48,820
Scott: They don't have the desktop.

268
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,574
Scott: They just put the laptop on the desk and plug it into monitors and this can get it done, right?

269
00:16:54,361 --> 00:16:56,077
Scott: This is perfectly decent.

270
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,980
Rym: I mean, if I wasn't a gamer and a podcaster video editor, I would probably do that.

271
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,934
Scott: Well, I mean, you can do your podcasting and your video editing.

272
00:17:03,974 --> 00:17:04,880
Scott: It just can't do your gaming.

273
00:17:05,843 --> 00:17:11,398
Rym: I don't think it could do the video editing I do as easily just because of the raw power I've got in a desktop.

274
00:17:13,821 --> 00:17:19,159
Scott: Even the lowest end MacBook that they just announced is vastly more powerful than the desktop you have right now.

275
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,021
Rym: Only because I can't get a 3080.

276
00:17:22,021 --> 00:17:23,981
Scott: Even if you could get a 3080.

277
00:17:23,981 --> 00:17:25,669
Rym: I'd like to see the render time difference.

278
00:17:25,729 --> 00:17:27,920
Rym: The benchmarks I've seen have been inconclusive so far.

279
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,200
Scott: Well, I don't think anyone's, you know, this thing just was announced.

280
00:17:32,304 --> 00:17:32,940
Scott: Besides Apple.

281
00:17:33,507 --> 00:17:33,952
Rym: Exactly.

282
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:34,397
Rym: So we'll see.

283
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,092
Scott: The M1 is still quite ridiculous compared to Intel CPUs.

284
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:48,959
Rym: I mean, part of the reason why I'm kind of just not that excited personally is that all of this, I'm kind of holding out for the next generation of M chips, like the M2, whatever that looks like.

285
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:51,880
Scott: I'm just not interested because this thing is big.

286
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:59,900
Scott: It's not as big and thick and heavy as like a gaming laptop, which is ridiculous, but it's still big enough to be ridiculous.

287
00:18:00,201 --> 00:18:02,420
Scott: I want tiny things, right?

288
00:18:02,501 --> 00:18:03,736
Scott: I feel like anyone who wants tiny.

289
00:18:04,488 --> 00:18:04,859
Scott: It's tiny.

290
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,516
Rym: Yeah, anyone who wants tiny doesn't want a book at all.

291
00:18:07,556 --> 00:18:08,140
Rym: They want a pad.

292
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:09,347
Scott: That's right.

293
00:18:09,408 --> 00:18:10,460
Scott: Get that keyboard off of there.

294
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:12,159
Scott: Or at least let me fold the keyboard back.

295
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,100
Scott: Just let me fold the keyboard back and actually I might be really interested.

296
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,287
Rym: I think that's actually smart that they've increased the size a little bit.

297
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:23,780
Rym: if the demographic is someone who needs a laptop for power for some reason.

298
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:30,780
Scott: Well, the demographic, you know, the people who actually use it professionally, I think it's maybe half the demographic.

299
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,920
Scott: The other half are people who don't actually need this much, but that's but they buy the MacBook Pro anyway.

300
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:47,400
Scott: It's a developer, you know, people doing jobs out there, you know, it's like, you know, just in office or, you know, and they're not doing anything that requires nearly this amount of horsepower, but they've got it anyway.

301
00:18:47,582 --> 00:18:49,360
Scott: Just like all the people who drive around the street.

302
00:18:49,682 --> 00:18:52,879
Scott: It's a massive truck and never tow anything and never put anything in the bed.

303
00:18:53,706 --> 00:18:54,178
Scott: Same thing.

304
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:59,960
Rym: There is one bit, though, and I'm going to read this sentence from Engadget because it just says everything that needs to be said.

305
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:06,398
Rym: Quote, "Each also has an iPhone-style camera notch that is likely to be

306
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,000
Rym: divisive.".

307
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:12,980
Scott: Well, you know, on the one hand, it's like, yeah, it's got a little notch at the top, right, with the camera in it.

308
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,014
Rym: That annoys me way more on a desktop or a laptop.

309
00:19:16,075 --> 00:19:16,959
Rym: On a phone, I don't care at all.

310
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,152
Scott: Well, vastly improved camera, but B, right?

311
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:27,340
Scott: First of all, you know, if you sit if you're sitting down in a knot, you know, in most places, you might plug in a monitor, which won't have a notch on it.

312
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:27,511
Scott: Yeah.

313
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:29,104
Scott: So that's one thing.

314
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:35,300
Scott: Secondly, they've designed it so that the notch is like intruding into the, you know, the bar at the top, right?

315
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,420
Scott: The menu bar, because every, you know, that's how OS Mac OS works.

316
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,685
Scott: It's always had that menu bar.

317
00:19:39,725 --> 00:19:43,200
Scott: that's separate from the, you know, whatever the currently focused program is.

318
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,480
Scott: Whereas on Windows, the menu bars are in in the windows.

319
00:19:47,602 --> 00:19:51,760
Scott: So there will never be anything up there except for the middle of the menu bar.

320
00:19:52,282 --> 00:19:57,160
Scott: So it would only ever be a problem if a program had so many pull down menus.

321
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:57,830
Rym: Yeah.

322
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:06,660
Scott: And then I'm sure the OS is going to smartly put a gap so that, you know, they'll be, you know, the pull down menus go on the sides and don't get hidden behind the notch.

323
00:20:08,061 --> 00:20:11,360
Scott: So that's really it's not going to interfere with anything you're doing.

324
00:20:11,862 --> 00:20:13,231
Scott: And it's better to have that.

325
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:14,780
Scott: It's like what was the alternative?

326
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,280
Scott: The alternative was more just to make the screen less tall by so many pixels.

327
00:20:19,461 --> 00:20:23,920
Scott: You're getting that many pixels, more space to do stuff in, you know, below that.

328
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,700
Rym: So, yeah, it's not really the only thing.

329
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:32,120
Rym: But again, the thing that it would affect that won't matter would be if there were a truly full screen application.

330
00:20:32,662 --> 00:20:35,440
Rym: But again, OS X, like you're not gaming on this thing with a full screen.

331
00:20:35,781 --> 00:20:37,740
Scott: If you I'm pretty sure the OS, right?

332
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:45,820
Scott: If you were to say, take a movie and the movie happened to be of a not of a taller aspect ratio such that you weren't going to have letterbox.

333
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,299
Rym: I'm sure it's just letterbox is the top across.

334
00:20:48,842 --> 00:20:52,360
Scott: It'll prevent the full screen app from encroaching in that top area.

335
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,041
Scott: Yeah.

336
00:20:53,061 --> 00:20:57,440
Rym: And I would have to assume the same thing would happen if you were playing a full screen game.

337
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,099
Rym: If you could even do that on a Mac.

338
00:20:59,480 --> 00:20:59,600
Scott: Yeah.

339
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:06,399
Scott: If there was a full screen game, I'm pretty sure it would cut it off and prevent it from using those pixels above where the notch is.

340
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:19,080
Scott: And also, if you put you know, they were smart to point out that, like, hey, you know, if you change your colors to dark mode, which I think most people do, who know that that's a thing you can do, dark mode bar is dark.

341
00:21:19,281 --> 00:21:21,719
Scott: And thus you don't really see the notch because it's also dark.

342
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:22,081
Rym: Yep.

343
00:21:22,423 --> 00:21:25,000
Rym: I expect a lot of people are going to complain bitterly about it.

344
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,560
Rym: But the people who will complain will be the kind of people who buy a MacBook Pro anyway.

345
00:21:29,502 --> 00:21:31,220
Scott: I mean, you got the new iPhone, right?

346
00:21:31,505 --> 00:21:31,657
Scott: Yeah.

347
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,468
Scott: There's a notch.

348
00:21:32,488 --> 00:21:33,299
Scott: There's a notch on there.

349
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:33,661
Rym: Yeah.

350
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:34,023
Rym: You know what?

351
00:21:34,064 --> 00:21:36,420
Rym: The notch annoyed me for like, let's see, how long did it annoy me?

352
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,420
Rym: A couple days and then I didn't care.

353
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,076
Rym: Like I stopped noticing it.

354
00:21:41,047 --> 00:21:41,300
Scott: Yeah.

355
00:21:41,761 --> 00:21:52,700
Rym: It's like it's like in the old days when you got the the far superior CRT monitors in terms of brightness and color and everything would have two little lines horizontally across the screen.

356
00:21:53,441 --> 00:21:58,800
Rym: And if you didn't use that type of monitor and then you sat down in front of one, they were super annoying.

357
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,419
Rym: You could not not see them.

358
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:05,798
Rym: But if you use one of those monitors long enough, you just they were just invisible to you like your brain just filtered them out.

359
00:22:08,231 --> 00:22:09,436
Rym: Yeah.

360
00:22:09,456 --> 00:22:12,770
Scott: They did put the incredible screen on this MacBook.

361
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,190
Rym: Yeah.

362
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:13,974
Rym: What's the resolution?

363
00:22:13,974 --> 00:22:14,837
Rym: 3456 by 2234 on the 16 inch one.

364
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,262
Rym: You lose about 400 pixels on the 14 inch one.

365
00:22:23,371 --> 00:22:29,149
Scott: It has the same like LED dynamic grid thing that the new iPad Pro has.

366
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:35,870
Scott: That's sort of a toned down version of what the big Apple expensive monitor has.

367
00:22:37,235 --> 00:22:40,090
Scott: You could plug that big expensive Apple monitor into this thing, though.

368
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:40,691
Scott: Yeah.

369
00:22:40,711 --> 00:22:42,075
Rym: That's not full LED.

370
00:22:42,135 --> 00:22:46,510
Rym: But as we've seen, there aren't like OLED monitors have a lot of issues still.

371
00:22:47,871 --> 00:22:47,971
Scott: Yeah.

372
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:55,070
Scott: No, I mean, I think this technology is, you know, it's like the monitors that other companies are making that sort of, you know, have the sort of zoned lighting.

373
00:22:55,451 --> 00:22:55,773
Scott: Right.

374
00:22:55,914 --> 00:22:58,210
Scott: You know, it's dynamic lighting, backlighting, whatever.

375
00:22:58,910 --> 00:22:59,252
Scott: Yeah.

376
00:22:59,393 --> 00:22:59,897
Scott: It's like, yeah.

377
00:22:59,957 --> 00:23:01,850
Scott: But Apple just took that to the next level.

378
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:05,097
Scott: There's just so many more lights all controlled individually.

379
00:23:05,397 --> 00:23:11,330
Scott: Whereas on my monitor, it's like, yeah, there's some dynamic, you know, backlighting, but it's like, what, like eight zones.

380
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,697
Scott: It's like a such a small number.

381
00:23:12,737 --> 00:23:12,878
Scott: Right.

382
00:23:12,898 --> 00:23:14,750
Scott: You can actually see the light like moving.

383
00:23:16,592 --> 00:23:16,853
Scott: Right.

384
00:23:17,155 --> 00:23:19,248
Scott: It's not great compared to what Apple has done.

385
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:20,150
Rym: Yeah.

386
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:20,531
Rym: Pretty much.

387
00:23:20,551 --> 00:23:31,130
Rym: I'm personally like really looking forward to what the next generation of all this stuff Apple's done with these chips are and whether or not Windows and gaming and GPUs become part of that ecosystem at some point.

388
00:23:31,553 --> 00:23:33,850
Rym: Or if GPUs become irrelevant with this technology.

389
00:23:35,351 --> 00:23:35,471
Scott: Yeah.

390
00:23:35,491 --> 00:23:44,386
Scott: I mean, like I don't see myself buying a MacBook Pro anytime soon because I'm really like between iPhone and iPad, it's like, I'm good.

391
00:23:44,426 --> 00:23:45,709
Scott: I got iPhone, iPad desktop.

392
00:23:45,729 --> 00:23:46,450
Scott: That's my combo.

393
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,110
Scott: And I don't see any, you know, it's pretty much perfect.

394
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,810
Rym: And I got iPhone laptop workstation.

395
00:23:52,671 --> 00:24:03,590
Scott: The only thing I could see is in a distant future, it would be quite distant actually in a distant future where my desktop is no longer powerful enough to get the job done.

396
00:24:04,772 --> 00:24:17,150
Scott: Uh, and yet the Mac with its M's has so far surpassed the PC that even though my dislike of Mac OS, uh, the PC is no longer like tenable.

397
00:24:17,951 --> 00:24:18,231
Scott: Right.

398
00:24:18,352 --> 00:24:19,855
Scott: For, for powerful computing.

399
00:24:20,496 --> 00:24:26,370
Scott: In which case, I think what would happen is my PC would become sort of like my, you know, Apple two GS.

400
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:30,899
Scott: It'd be like the thing I have so that I can run old software that the Mac can't run.

401
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:36,530
Scott: And then I would just get, you know, MacBook Pro with like an M5 on my desk.

402
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:36,991
Rym: Right.

403
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:37,091
Rym: Yeah.

404
00:24:37,111 --> 00:24:43,090
Rym: Which will really come down to if this world will ever support gaming in any like reasonable way.

405
00:24:44,411 --> 00:24:44,591
Scott: Yeah.

406
00:24:44,611 --> 00:24:53,290
Scott: That could in a world that's like that, if, if, you know, the, the PCs stagnate in terms of performance enhancing, like, you know, which is really, I guess on Nvidia's shoulders.

407
00:24:54,450 --> 00:25:03,690
Scott: Um, but yeah, if, if PCs somehow stagnate performance wise and Apple pulls too far ahead, that could hurt PC gaming as a whole.

408
00:25:04,651 --> 00:25:09,981
Scott: Uh, for people who don't make Mac ports of their games, you would do.

409
00:25:10,401 --> 00:25:14,910
Scott: Um, but I think it also is going to matter a lot in terms of the rest of the world.

410
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:15,171
Scott: Right.

411
00:25:15,191 --> 00:25:21,510
Scott: The rest of the world is I think, you know, max aren't so popular and depending on where you are, right.

412
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:25,179
Scott: You know, all those people and say, you know, China, right.

413
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,245
Scott: It's like, they're playing all their games.

414
00:25:27,285 --> 00:25:29,009
Scott: I don't think they're playing them on Macs over there.

415
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,311
Rym: Yup.

416
00:25:30,591 --> 00:25:38,382
Rym: Plus, well, like in terms of stagnation, I'm running my workstation still is an i7 6700K.

417
00:25:38,423 --> 00:25:41,167
Rym: That is a sixth generation Intel CPU.

418
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:41,707
Rym: We're on what?

419
00:25:42,028 --> 00:25:43,490
Rym: Gen 11 right now?

420
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:46,420
Scott: I have an 8700K with a 1070 and it's perfectly, it's perfect.

421
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:49,671
Scott: Oh yeah.

422
00:25:50,152 --> 00:25:59,931
Rym: My a 6700K, uh, literally one thing has, well, two things have ever pushed that CPU to 100%.

423
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:06,770
Rym: One of those things, that warp stabilizer I talked about before, same thing that pushes the RAM, very niche edge case in premiere.

424
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,657
Rym: And two, uh, hearts of iron.

425
00:26:09,697 --> 00:26:14,070
Rym: four is CPU intensive and it maxes out my CPU when the war gets pretty complex.

426
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:18,500
Rym: Uh, everything else is using like 20% of my CPU.

427
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,310
Rym: Maybe even when I'm playing like games or rendering 4K video or do something crazy.

428
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:24,076
Rym: I'm using all those no CPU.

429
00:26:24,136 --> 00:26:25,541
Rym: It's all GPU.

430
00:26:25,902 --> 00:26:28,130
Rym: It's all GPU in there and hard drive to a degree.

431
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,322
Scott: So, yeah, but, but in the case of the M chip, you don't have a separate GPU.

432
00:26:32,362 --> 00:26:33,967
Scott: It's all the one chip doing everything.

433
00:26:34,007 --> 00:26:34,750
Scott: It's system on chip.

434
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:35,231
Scott: Yep.

435
00:26:35,551 --> 00:26:36,853
Rym: And it'll just come down to.

436
00:26:37,394 --> 00:26:45,646
Rym: can that chip actually achieve the performance of like a 3080 in the way that games use GPU type processing?

437
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,190
Rym: or will games change the way they're built?

438
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:55,109
Scott: It could, but the problem is, is that games, if you took say like, you know, a brand new game, like, you know, Doom Eternal or something, right?

439
00:26:56,491 --> 00:27:05,870
Scott: Because it's so different architecturally, you'd have to like rewrite a large portion of the game engine or at least port to do some major porting and optimization work.

440
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:12,190
Rym: Or the M dot X chips get so powerful or so good at virtualization to somehow make that moot.

441
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:18,505
Scott: Well, the Rosetta thing is quite strong, but that's why it's hard enough to play it.

442
00:27:20,771 --> 00:27:21,132
Rym: Exactly.

443
00:27:21,152 --> 00:27:21,833
Rym: That's what I'm getting at.

444
00:27:21,914 --> 00:27:29,230
Rym: It is hard to predict what this ecosystem will look like, but five-ish years from now, I think we'll know where the real trajectory is.

445
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:30,280
Scott: Anyway.

446
00:27:30,971 --> 00:27:31,855
Rym: Anyway, and some other news.

447
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:35,070
Rym: we don't have to dwell on, but there is an interesting story.

448
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:44,430
Rym: This might be the first time this exact specific legal scenario has happened, though similar things or related things have definitely happened.

449
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:52,209
Rym: Long story short, this happened recently, like October 6th, a kid in Hopewell, this news site is not telling me what state that's in.

450
00:27:53,730 --> 00:28:02,910
Rym: Anyway, this kid printed components and also bought other components to make a gun, like a Glock pistol, basically.

451
00:28:04,033 --> 00:28:04,549
Rym: Put it together.

452
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,550
Scott: The kid had a 3D printer of their own?

453
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,194
Rym: Yep, had a 3D printer of their own.

454
00:28:08,736 --> 00:28:13,750
Rym: Basically made a Glock and then proceeded to immediately accidentally shoot themselves.

455
00:28:14,274 --> 00:28:16,109
Rym: They're not dead, they just hurt themselves with this gun.

456
00:28:17,352 --> 00:28:19,023
Scott: Where do they get the bullet from?

457
00:28:19,124 --> 00:28:20,050
Scott: They can't print the bullet.

458
00:28:20,531 --> 00:28:21,589
Rym: You can just buy bullets.

459
00:28:22,391 --> 00:28:24,910
Scott: I'm saying, who sold ammo to a kid?

460
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:29,130
Rym: Depending on the state you're in, it is very legal for kids to get bullets.

461
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:30,963
Scott: Well, that's a problem.

462
00:28:31,186 --> 00:28:31,409
Scott: Anyway.

463
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,094
Rym: Anyway, we've talked about this before.

464
00:28:35,276 --> 00:28:43,050
Rym: In the US, most firearms, the only thing that's actually regulated, is one very specific component of the firearm.

465
00:28:43,232 --> 00:28:44,670
Rym: Usually it's like the lower receiver.

466
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:49,830
Scott: Good part because it's hard to write legal regulations.

467
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:55,630
Rym: Hey, if you're a nerd, if you're a computer nerd, alright, look at my desktop or look at your desktop.

468
00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:00,630
Rym: What part of that is the computer if you have to write a law that regulates computers?

469
00:29:01,931 --> 00:29:02,974
Rym: Is it the CPU?

470
00:29:03,395 --> 00:29:04,458
Rym: Is it the motherboard?

471
00:29:04,698 --> 00:29:07,726
Rym: What if I swap the motherboard but use the same CPU?

472
00:29:08,027 --> 00:29:09,210
Rym: Is it a different computer?

473
00:29:09,631 --> 00:29:13,019
Rym: That same question comes up in guns, and guess what?

474
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,190
Rym: Judges in the legal system can't fucking define either one.

475
00:29:17,991 --> 00:29:28,830
Scott: Well, okay, so let's not go into it, but the problem is that in the United States, the reason they have to define these things is because they're trying to make some guns illegal and others not illegal.

476
00:29:29,212 --> 00:29:33,490
Scott: If they were just making guns illegal, you wouldn't have to define which parts.

477
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:43,490
Rym: Yeah, if we could define something that uses a combustible explosive to fire a projectile above a certain speed in a particular direction, this would all be a lot easier.

478
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,922
Scott: Yeah, any tool, any machine that does this is illegal.

479
00:29:46,983 --> 00:29:47,143
Scott: Done.

480
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:48,690
Scott: It's really easy to write a law for that.

481
00:29:49,352 --> 00:29:52,685
Scott: But it's like, okay, a barrel is just a metal tube.

482
00:29:52,725 --> 00:29:53,227
Scott: What are you going to do?

483
00:29:53,287 --> 00:29:54,090
Scott: Outlaw metal tubes?

484
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,292
Rym: Yep, and that's the thing.

485
00:29:55,552 --> 00:30:05,207
Rym: People might say, the reason I'm bringing up this news is a lot of people make the argument that we don't need to worry about this problem yet because you can't actually 3D print a gun.

486
00:30:05,227 --> 00:30:06,990
Rym: that will work, and that is mostly true.

487
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:20,050
Rym: However, you can totally 3D print the one or two pieces that you can't just buy because they're regulated, and most of the rest of the things you need are not that regulated or even completely unregulated.

488
00:30:20,632 --> 00:30:27,190
Rym: I can go buy metal tubes and all these other parts and machine everything I need and 3D print just this last piece.

489
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:38,590
Rym: So the question of, how do we deal with the fact that people can 3D print enough stuff to make a real working gun to the point that they actually shot themselves with it by accident?

490
00:30:39,692 --> 00:30:42,810
Rym: How are we going to address that as a technology in America?

491
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:47,570
Scott: I know, we talked about this in an extremely early episode of GeekNights, like ten plus years ago.

492
00:30:47,851 --> 00:30:48,352
Scott: And guess what?

493
00:30:48,412 --> 00:30:55,550
Rym: No one answered that question, and here we are now where it's not clear that the police can actually even charge this kid with a crime?

494
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,110
Scott: Why would it be a crime to hurt yourself?

495
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,010
Rym: Well, would it be a crime to have made the gun in the first place?

496
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:08,429
Scott: Well, maybe, but hurting yourself shouldn't be a crime.

497
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:15,550
Rym: But making a firearm that is dangerous enough to then hurt yourself or someone else could hurt themselves with?

498
00:31:15,772 --> 00:31:17,469
Scott: That might be worthy of being a crime, yeah.

499
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:37,530
Rym: I think we're going to see, as more incidents like this occur, I think we're going to see calls, regardless of if that's the right way to go, on regulating 3D printers, on regulating 3D printing technology, on regulating plans for 3D printers, which then might violate our favorite amendment, the First Amendment.

500
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:44,630
Scott: So that's a really sad thing if it comes to be, because I don't think people realize this enough, right?

501
00:31:44,710 --> 00:32:00,910
Scott: But when you look out at the world of technology and different product categories, 3D printing is like the one category where the open source, open hacker ethos type of thing has won out in the marketplace.

502
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,120
Rym: It won, it lives, it thrives.

503
00:32:03,261 --> 00:32:04,930
Rym: I can get a 3D printer, print my own stuff.

504
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:13,890
Scott: It's not buying a 3D printer as like this sealed device that comes with proprietary software that you can't repair from Apple, right?

505
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:25,470
Scott: You're getting a 3D printer that inter-operates with the same files as every other 3D printer where you can choose where you get your plastic from, you can use it with any kind of software, you can program it yourself.

506
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:31,010
Scott: Every 3D printer is all open, almost all of them are open and cool and hackery.

507
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:42,770
Rym: Even the advanced ones, the ones that like some nerd is not going to just buy and put in their basement, like the ones that are at a Shapeways or like in a factory that can do like metal printing or carbon fiber or whatever ridiculous nonsense.

508
00:32:43,371 --> 00:32:51,630
Scott: It's like the 3D printing marketplace in terms of capitalism, that's what it looks like when Linux on the desktop wins.

509
00:32:53,211 --> 00:32:58,390
Scott: That's what it looks like when Linux on the desktop wins and everyone has a phone that runs, right?

510
00:32:58,711 --> 00:33:05,486
Scott: It's like, that's what that looks like, but we only managed to succeed in getting our ideal thing through in that one area.

511
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,836
Rym: I do have a minor counter argument though.

512
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:14,970
Rym: My minor counter argument, a little bit of a devil's advocate, but also kind of an earnest argument.

513
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:33,650
Rym: It's still the early stage of Linux on the desktop because what we don't have yet is a mass market of people using this stuff to the point that an ecosystem for malware, fake plans, failed nonsense like print a Gucci bag.

514
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:36,421
Rym: Like we didn't get to the point where everybody's using these things.

515
00:33:36,622 --> 00:33:38,490
Rym: We're at the point where nerds are using these things.

516
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:49,790
Rym: Open source software, Linux on the desktop was great when nerds just wanted to not pay for Office, but now even the best open source office is like deeply inferior to like regular old Microsoft Office.

517
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,523
Rym: Nevermind the fact that no one's running Linux on the desktop.

518
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:53,490
Rym: I dare you.

519
00:33:54,251 --> 00:34:00,170
Scott: If 3D printing gets to diamond age levels of printing, I think you'll see big wealthy companies enter the market.

520
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,397
Rym: I think you'll also see malware.

521
00:34:02,517 --> 00:34:05,106
Rym: Like what were the early computer viruses even on Linux?

522
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:06,009
Rym: Like people would write them.

523
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:09,534
Scott: You go to your diamond age printer and you're like, make me a cupcake.

524
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:10,637
Scott: It's a poison cupcake.

525
00:34:10,677 --> 00:34:12,139
Rym: You make me a gun.

526
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:18,750
Scott: The bullet comes out the back like you stand there watching the gun get printed and it shoots you while you're watching.

527
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:27,329
Rym: Someone hacks your 3D printer and starts printing bootlegs in your house while you're on vacation, then breaks into your house and steals them.

528
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:38,770
Rym: Anyway, this is a story that is not going to change anything, but we're going to see over the next five or six years a lot more stories like this bit by bit.

529
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:49,110
Rym: And the fascinating thing to keep an eye on is that our government is so paralyzed that nothing will be done in the law about any of this anytime soon.

530
00:34:49,591 --> 00:34:54,690
Rym: And we're going to see how this evolves with this basically zero regulation and zero government intervention.

531
00:34:55,791 --> 00:35:03,210
Scott: Yeah, it would have to be something that it became like a real constant terror for every one of all parties for the government to do anything.

532
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:10,284
Rym: Despite the fact that this is like trying to regulate things like CNC printing, like it's not a matter of closing the barn door.

533
00:35:10,564 --> 00:35:11,967
Rym: The entire barn fell down.

534
00:35:12,087 --> 00:35:13,350
Rym: It disappeared decades ago.

535
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,434
Rym: No one is even sure there ever was a barn.

536
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:21,650
Rym: And maybe before we die, someone in the US Congress will talk about this once or twice.

537
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:29,176
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

538
00:35:29,537 --> 00:35:40,886
Rym: So in the gaming world, the Nintendo Entertainment System era, there was a race to make a special controller that you could sell to the market.

539
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:45,510
Rym: that wasn't a traditional controller for mostly honestly stupid marketing reasons.

540
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:50,318
Rym: But you had one company making the power glove and one company making the U-Force.

541
00:35:50,939 --> 00:35:53,884
Rym: They were both garbage products.

542
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:55,287
Rym: We all know this in retrospect.

543
00:35:55,367 --> 00:35:57,270
Rym: As kids, we even knew this at the time.

544
00:35:57,631 --> 00:35:58,554
Rym: I saw the power glove.

545
00:35:58,595 --> 00:35:59,317
Rym: I knew it was bad.

546
00:35:59,598 --> 00:36:00,441
Rym: I saw the U-Force.

547
00:36:00,501 --> 00:36:01,264
Rym: I knew it was bad.

548
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,489
Rym: I knew I didn't want it.

549
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:28,890
Rym: But what this is, is a video that explains in detail where one of these things, the U-Force, which was wireless hands free controllers for the Nintendo Entertainment System, where it came from, the engineering behind it, the design, the history, like the full story of a piece of technology that on one hand was really cool and innovative and worked really hard to make a usable product.

550
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:33,434
Rym: And two, made a product that no one on earth wanted

551
00:36:34,055 --> 00:36:34,195
Scott: and

552
00:36:34,395 --> 00:36:50,410
Rym: mostly spent their efforts trying to make a market for something and then get people to want it, despite the fact that the fundamental thing was honestly a terrible idea from the beginning that could never have succeeded, no matter how good the technology was.

553
00:36:51,011 --> 00:37:11,730
Rym: And it is fascinating to see how product design happened in that era, especially because they interviewed people who were directly involved, who even now are pretty excited about this stuff and sort of miss the fact that they were almost doing the wrong thing and almost misusing the technology because they were trying to solve a market problem that didn't exist.

554
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,500
Rym: So what do you got?

555
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,481
Scott: Oh, thing of the day.

556
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:17,884
Scott: Yeah, it was my thing of the day.

557
00:37:17,984 --> 00:37:18,344
Scott: All right.

558
00:37:18,384 --> 00:37:19,386
Scott: Just this cute little thing.

559
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:28,980
Scott: So if you open your, you know, your any Unix computer and you go to the terminal and you type in Cal, C-A-L, it'll print out this nice little text calendar for you.

560
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,823
Scott: It defaults to the current month usually.

561
00:37:31,925 --> 00:37:41,540
Scott: And it's kind of nice, especially like, you know, you might want to like email someone to like show, you know, like the monthly calendar with, you know, the numbers laid out and see what day and everything.

562
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,442
Scott: It's pretty useful.

563
00:37:42,602 --> 00:37:42,822
Scott: Right.

564
00:37:42,902 --> 00:37:44,044
Scott: If you don't have a wall calendar.

565
00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:49,454
Scott: But, you know, that's not everyone's got a terminal.

566
00:37:50,816 --> 00:37:52,319
Scott: Sometimes you got a phone, maybe.

567
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:52,780
Scott: Right.

568
00:37:53,821 --> 00:37:58,412
Scott: And sometimes just for whatever reason, you want a text calendar just made out of ASCII.

569
00:37:58,633 --> 00:38:01,500
Scott: But in this case, Unicode text, you just, you know, a calendar.

570
00:38:02,121 --> 00:38:16,380
Scott: So this website, Cordy dot dev slash calendar generator allows you to generate and easily copy into your clipboard a calendar of a single month, sometimes with like certain days highlighted or whatever in Unicode.

571
00:38:17,241 --> 00:38:24,832
Scott: And then you can copy and paste it into, I don't know, a tweet, a forum post, an email, wherever you might need to put a calendar.

572
00:38:25,774 --> 00:38:29,840
Scott: So it's pretty it's just a tiny, cute and useful thing there.

573
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:30,561
Scott: So

574
00:38:30,881 --> 00:38:48,640
Rym: it does, though, expose a an accessibility problem that has come up a lot recently in social media around emoji, where if you copy pasted this into pretty much anything and whoever happened to see it was blind and using a screen reader, it would destroy their screen reader with long, ridiculous nonsense.

575
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:58,160
Rym: And there's no way around that, despite the fact that for literally any other user, this is more accessible and honestly very useful.

576
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:10,700
Rym: Yeah, but like you could cause a problem if you copy pasted this into a tweet for anyone who happened to use a screen reader to view that tweet in a way that a copy paste of an image screenshot of a calendar would not cause that same problem.

577
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,900
Scott: But the image screen of a of a calendar, you know, they wouldn't be able to read it, but it would just say image in the screen.

578
00:39:21,681 --> 00:39:28,320
Scott: That's a good reminder, though, that if you tweet images, you should be putting some alt text on there, people.

579
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,082
Rym: Yep.

580
00:39:29,305 --> 00:39:30,280
Rym: But where's the line?

581
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:36,740
Scott: You should be like, October monthly calendar with the, you know, the Wednesday the 13th highlighted or whatever it is.

582
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,880
Rym: But there's no way to do that with an ASCII calendar.

583
00:39:41,528 --> 00:39:42,119
Scott: I suppose not.

584
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:47,280
Scott: I guess ASCII art in general is just really inaccessible to people who can't see.

585
00:39:47,621 --> 00:39:48,865
Rym: It's not even any unaccessible.

586
00:39:48,905 --> 00:39:53,300
Rym: It's anti accessible in that the way screen readers work, it destroys the screen reader.

587
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,120
Scott: Yeah, I guess what would a cock boat look like?

588
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,565
Scott: Well, the same thing happens.

589
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,260
Rym: It's like, so a lot of us like to use a lot of emoji.

590
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:12,980
Rym: If you put more than a couple emoji in a row, it also just ruins screen readers, despite the fact that for anyone else, that is often a useful or interesting visual way to display information.

591
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:28,260
Rym: Granted, I would say the actual solution here, like where the problem lies, is with the screen readers themselves need to be intelligent enough to handle this type of situation the way people will naturally use technology in an open forum without constraints.

592
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,142
Rym: But I digress.

593
00:40:30,162 --> 00:40:31,005
Rym: This thing is super cool.

594
00:40:31,046 --> 00:40:34,920
Rym: It's just something I thought of because that's a topic I've been thinking of a lot lately for other reasons.

595
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,203
Scott: Absolutely.

596
00:40:36,243 --> 00:40:37,700
Scott: Think about that very important topic.

597
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,289
Rym: Yeah, you might not have the right answers when you think about that topic.

598
00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:45,118
Rym: You might not be able to say, well, this is the right idea, but at least think about it like.

599
00:40:45,158 --> 00:40:45,900
Rym: that's the first step.

600
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:50,165
Rym: In the moment, Tale of Genji is our book club book.

601
00:40:50,185 --> 00:40:57,159
Rym: I actually haven't read it since last week because this past weekend I was super busy, but I will be continuing with Genji this week.

602
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:01,007
Rym: Our last PAX panel is on YouTube.

603
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:04,359
Rym: We will not be like going to conventions anytime soon.

604
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,631
Rym: I don't know what else we've got going on.

605
00:41:06,651 --> 00:41:07,660
Rym: Check out our stuff on the internet.

606
00:41:08,502 --> 00:41:15,120
Scott: I completely redid and finished redoing the newsletter software that we have going on.

607
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:26,180
Scott: So if you go to newsletter.frontrowcrew.com, you're going to see a form to subscribe to the newsletter and you're going to see a link to go to the archive to peruse all old newsletters.

608
00:41:28,641 --> 00:41:32,072
Scott: And there's an admin interface you can't reach because I secured it.

609
00:41:32,372 --> 00:41:34,860
Scott: I can go to send newsletters.

610
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,880
Scott: And because we have this platform now, assuming it works, we're going to test it out with the next newsletter that I started writing.

611
00:41:44,281 --> 00:41:47,392
Scott: I'm not saying we're going to do this, but we could write more.

612
00:41:47,452 --> 00:41:49,880
Scott: We could add more newsletters than just the GeekNights newsletter.

613
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:56,655
Rym: Which I'm excited about because a long time ago I did blog with the Rimbler in parallel to GeekNights and I stopped.

614
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,900
Rym: I didn't have a good place to do it and I was also bored and lazy.

615
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:06,320
Scott: I'm not saying we're going to do this, but we have the technological capacity now to make as many newsletters as we want.

616
00:42:07,121 --> 00:42:09,546
Scott: That would all have to be subscribed to separately.

617
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:13,756
Scott: And there's some other benefits of having this.

618
00:42:13,817 --> 00:42:15,080
Scott: So it's up now.

619
00:42:16,302 --> 00:42:19,149
Scott: So that's a thing.

620
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:23,740
Scott: Since I mentioned it on the last show, at least two people came and subscribed.

621
00:42:25,782 --> 00:42:27,859
Rym: So I have a second dibs for once.

622
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,120
Scott: Oh, Rimb's going to get rid of something.

623
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,085
Rym: And it's a real something, but I'm going to be clear.

624
00:42:33,105 --> 00:42:40,540
Rym: I would prefer to give this to someone in the New York City area, but I could meet you at a subway station to give it to you.

625
00:42:41,221 --> 00:42:47,253
Rym: I have got a large, full-featured LED light panel.

626
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:50,760
Rym: Like a big for-real one with a stand and everything.

627
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:58,295
Rym: And a large gray backdrop for making video with all the poles and everything to set it up.

628
00:42:58,335 --> 00:42:59,197
Rym: that's portable.

629
00:42:59,437 --> 00:43:00,640
Rym: Take it up, put it down together.

630
00:43:01,221 --> 00:43:11,320
Rym: So if you're a person who is trying to make videos and you could use a for-real LED light panel spotlight with hoods and everything on it, and a gray backdrop and all that biz.

631
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:15,808
Rym: If you're in New York City, let me know and I'll sort out a way to get it to you.

632
00:43:15,828 --> 00:43:21,880
Rym: I would prefer to give it to a black, indigenous, and/or person of color as opposed to just a white dude.

633
00:43:22,441 --> 00:43:29,620
Rym: Like, full disclosure, if nobody wants it and the only people who ask are white dudes, I will eventually give it to one of you.

634
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:35,480
Rym: But if you're not a white dude, reach out to me first because I really want to enable creators and this stuff is really useful.

635
00:43:36,101 --> 00:43:41,880
Rym: If you're asking why I'm getting rid of it, I have better, more compact light panels and better backdrops now.

636
00:43:42,341 --> 00:43:45,028
Rym: So I don't see a world where I would ever use these again.

637
00:43:45,429 --> 00:43:49,500
Rym: Not because they're bad, just because they don't suit my own personal use cases anymore.

638
00:43:52,241 --> 00:43:56,720
Rym: That's the only kind of thing I'll try to give away on second dibs because all the other stuff I've already tried to give away and no one wants.

639
00:44:00,281 --> 00:44:03,089
Scott: Everything I tried to get rid of, I successfully got rid of for money.

640
00:44:03,109 --> 00:44:06,158
Scott: I just let people name their price and I was like,

641
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:06,439
Scott: "Alright.".

642
00:44:06,942 --> 00:44:10,078
Rym: I'll give this away for free as long as you can meet me somewhere in New York City to give it to you.

643
00:44:12,081 --> 00:44:13,203
Rym: So yeah, let's get into it.

644
00:44:13,423 --> 00:44:15,728
Rym: Operating systems, upgrades, changes, everything.

645
00:44:15,768 --> 00:44:21,920
Rym: Partly I'm thinking about this because Windows 11, depending on who you are and how much you care, either came out or is coming out.

646
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:27,531
Rym: Mac OS updates, but also switching operating systems in general.

647
00:44:27,671 --> 00:44:31,060
Rym: I switched from Android OS to iOS recently.

648
00:44:32,022 --> 00:44:32,503
Scott: Oh, true.

649
00:44:32,824 --> 00:44:40,580
Rym: That's the first time I have switched operating systems on a device since when I went from Linux on the desktop to about two days.

650
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,640
Scott: What about Palm OS to Android?

651
00:44:43,201 --> 00:44:44,620
Rym: I did do Palm OS to Android.

652
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,299
Scott: Web OS to Android.

653
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:51,313
Rym: I also did Windows to Linux on the desktop.

654
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:53,620
Rym: There was a time when Scott and I both did Linux on the desktop.

655
00:44:54,281 --> 00:45:03,740
Rym: I then went for about 48 hours to Mac OS and then I went from that back to Linux on the desktop and then very quickly after that to Windows.

656
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:06,945
Rym: But also there's a bit of a history here.

657
00:45:06,986 --> 00:45:08,069
Rym: This is a broad topic of.

658
00:45:09,033 --> 00:45:11,100
Rym: we're old enough to remember where this wasn't a thing.

659
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:13,524
Rym: You didn't upgrade the operating system.

660
00:45:14,065 --> 00:45:24,261
Rym: often on pre-internet computers other than maybe, if you were lucky, you got a copy of Windows 3.1.1 and installed that to replace your Windows 3.1.

661
00:45:24,261 --> 00:45:25,388
Rym: But that's if you were lucky.

662
00:45:25,851 --> 00:45:26,999
Scott: Some people upgraded it.

663
00:45:28,803 --> 00:45:32,711
Scott: For most people, the difference between Windows 3.0 and 3.1 or 3.1.1 was basically nothing.

664
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:34,434
Scott: They all ran the same software.

665
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,880
Rym: You only needed Windows 3.1.1 if you had a network card, basically.

666
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:51,340
Scott: Right, but maybe if you had an office and your office had a tech guy who actually could set up the workgroup stuff and it meant something, but that was almost nobody.

667
00:45:52,061 --> 00:45:54,520
Scott: Almost nobody actually had that stuff doing anything.

668
00:45:55,222 --> 00:46:00,038
Scott: A lot of people had Windows for workgroups on their computer, but they weren't actually doing any workgroups.

669
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:00,640
Scott: They just had it.

670
00:46:01,141 --> 00:46:06,699
Rym: I had it because I had an actual ethernet card because of our early cable modem and some other stuff and we did use it.

671
00:46:09,781 --> 00:46:11,879
Rym: Upgrading back then was not like upgrading is now.

672
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:20,120
Rym: But also what an OS is and what it means has changed a lot since those early days where the OS was based.

673
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:27,700
Rym: I mean, we did a whole show on OS's and ancient GeekNights times, which basically just the meta system that you use to interface with the computer itself.

674
00:46:28,182 --> 00:46:31,900
Rym: But now operating systems come along with a lot of their own baggage and stuff.

675
00:46:32,381 --> 00:46:40,500
Rym: And in most cases are the user experience of a computer as opposed to just the thing you use to launch the things that are themselves the user experiences.

676
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,389
Scott: There's a great talk, actually.

677
00:46:43,429 --> 00:46:45,980
Scott: Let me send Rym this link so you can include it in the show.

678
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:51,600
Scott: It's a recent talk from Usenix, which is supposed to be an operating system conference.

679
00:46:52,562 --> 00:46:52,845
Scott: Right.

680
00:46:52,906 --> 00:46:54,038
Scott: There you go.

681
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:58,680
Scott: And it basically talks about, oh, it's time for operating systems to rediscover hardware.

682
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:06,740
Scott: And basically what he's talking about in here, really TLDR, but you should watch this, even though it's an hour long.

683
00:47:07,621 --> 00:47:14,480
Scott: What he talks about is like, hey, the operating system is supposed to be the piece of software that goes between the hardware.

684
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:19,640
Scott: Because if every it used to be back in the day, every program you wrote had to talk to the hardware directly.

685
00:47:20,301 --> 00:47:21,825
Scott: And that wasn't tenable.

686
00:47:21,986 --> 00:47:22,166
Scott: Right.

687
00:47:22,227 --> 00:47:26,680
Scott: It's like you looked at how many DOS games had to have drivers for all these different sound cards.

688
00:47:26,821 --> 00:47:26,981
Scott: Right.

689
00:47:27,001 --> 00:47:27,463
Scott: That wasn't.

690
00:47:27,825 --> 00:47:30,274
Scott: you had to tell your IRQ to a video game.

691
00:47:30,335 --> 00:47:31,680
Scott: That was not sustainable.

692
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:42,380
Scott: So the operating system was supposed to go between the hardware and the software so that you could write a program and have it run on a wide variety of different hardware.

693
00:47:42,721 --> 00:47:54,740
Scott: As long as the same operating system was on all that hardware, because the operating system would expose the same interface to the software and then translate that with drivers and other things to whatever hardware was there.

694
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,705
Scott: And that was the job of an operating system.

695
00:47:56,925 --> 00:47:57,066
Scott: Right.

696
00:47:57,627 --> 00:48:02,600
Scott: An operating system also would provide a shell, which is like the default user interface.

697
00:48:03,241 --> 00:48:03,422
Scott: Right.

698
00:48:03,462 --> 00:48:08,600
Scott: For doing stuff that wasn't a particular piece of software.

699
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:17,320
Rym: But like early versions of Windows, like pre 3.0 even, you would run DOS and then you would run Windows from within DOS.

700
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,141
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

701
00:48:20,422 --> 00:48:35,260
Scott: Now, what's happened nowadays and what he's talking about in this lecture is that the actual operating systems, all of them, not just, well, I guess except Mac OS, because they control their hardware also and sort of avoid this problem.

702
00:48:36,461 --> 00:48:41,807
Scott: Is that they're not really managing all the hardware that's in the computer?

703
00:48:43,068 --> 00:48:54,840
Scott: because this, you know, the architecture that is actually in the computer does not resemble the, you know, fictional architecture that the operating systems are designed around.

704
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:55,341
Scott: Right.

705
00:48:55,781 --> 00:49:00,527
Scott: So what's actually happening is like, for example, in your computer, you have like these systems on a chip.

706
00:49:00,788 --> 00:49:04,693
Scott: You might have like a power management module in some chip somewhere.

707
00:49:05,133 --> 00:49:10,240
Scott: that's managing all the power stuff on your motherboard and between all your different hardware.

708
00:49:10,961 --> 00:49:13,365
Scott: And the operating system doesn't even know that that's going on.

709
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:13,986
Scott: Right.

710
00:49:14,126 --> 00:49:23,760
Scott: Normally the operating system should be talking to like a power management chip and doing things like, ah, I'm not doing it because the operating system knows like what software the user's running.

711
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,503
Scott: So we could be like, OK, turn that off, turn that on.

712
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:26,764
Scott: Right.

713
00:49:27,144 --> 00:49:30,749
Scott: And Mac OS does those sorts of things because they control the whole picture.

714
00:49:31,289 --> 00:49:39,860
Scott: But in terms of all the other computers, they basically push the operating system, the one that you're interfacing with into a corner.

715
00:49:40,761 --> 00:49:44,466
Scott: Where it can believe that this old model is still true.

716
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,570
Scott: And then all the hardware is like managing itself.

717
00:49:47,671 --> 00:49:54,520
Scott: In some cases, you have hardware in your computer, like running Linux on its own, like a separate operating system.

718
00:49:54,640 --> 00:50:05,334
Scott: And I got chips somewhere because each like your GPU, right, that video card might have its own computer in it running Linux that your computer is talking to, thinking it's just a video card.

719
00:50:05,374 --> 00:50:06,616
Scott: But it's another computer in there.

720
00:50:07,076 --> 00:50:07,276
Scott: Right.

721
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:10,020
Scott: That's hiding this whole world from your main operating system.

722
00:50:10,521 --> 00:50:17,371
Scott: And his goal is like, hey, let's actually write the software for every part of the computer.

723
00:50:17,832 --> 00:50:18,052
Scott: Right.

724
00:50:18,072 --> 00:50:20,716
Scott: So the operating system is truly the operating system.

725
00:50:20,756 --> 00:50:23,460
Scott: And all those things are working together and knowing about each other.

726
00:50:26,181 --> 00:50:36,613
Scott: In a world like that, right, if that truly happens, then it's like, yeah, you need to have an operating system and you're going to need to update it when hardware updates.

727
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:42,880
Scott: Like you put a new hardware in, you're going to need to like, you know, get your operating system into that hardware to like install it.

728
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:54,400
Rym: I think that almost edges into this point to where the traditional definition of operating system is simplistic and honestly not relevant to the modern world in any capacity.

729
00:50:55,020 --> 00:51:04,075
Scott: And all these firmwares and micro codes and things, it's like, those are softwares that are creating like yet another layer between the user and the hardware.

730
00:51:04,135 --> 00:51:07,320
Rym: Like I would go so far as to say the user facing software and the hardware.

731
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:15,717
Rym: I would say that Mac OS and Windows are not by any like by any old definition operating systems in any meaningful way anymore.

732
00:51:16,018 --> 00:51:17,100
Rym: They are platforms.

733
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:18,801
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

734
00:51:18,861 --> 00:51:26,979
Scott: But I mean, it's also most of the operating system stuff, even on Mac OS has, you know, gets pushed into like the kernel, whatever the kernel is.

735
00:51:27,741 --> 00:51:32,826
Scott: And yet they still provide on top of their kernel, right?

736
00:51:33,066 --> 00:51:38,953
Scott: All of this user land stuff, libraries, tools, all this other things, right?

737
00:51:38,973 --> 00:51:45,340
Scott: That's why, you know, piece of crap Richard Stallman would always talk about GNU/Linux because it's like Linux on itself is just a kernel.

738
00:51:46,302 --> 00:51:48,260
Scott: It's like that kernel on its own doesn't do anything.

739
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,920
Rym: Yeah, then you had a bunch of binary files you can execute using that kernel.

740
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:57,229
Scott: All this GNU stack stuff that you put on top of it, that's what the user is actually.

741
00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:03,680
Scott: the user is interfacing with before they've installed other software, even though some of that stuff might itself be software.

742
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:13,600
Scott: And we've sort of colloquially included all of that, like default platform ephemera stuff, you know, the default user interface, the shell.

743
00:52:14,021 --> 00:52:25,360
Scott: We consider all of that to be now the operating system, which is speaking casually when that's not really the operating system, that's just like bundled software by the technical definitions of operating system.

744
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:43,100
Rym: But we're at this point too, where even professionals using computers in very professional and technical tasks, those distinctions don't actually matter to most of them in a material way in a way that in the old days, they did matter a lot more, partly because things were a lot simpler.

745
00:52:43,725 --> 00:52:45,700
Rym: And there were different operating paradigms.

746
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:51,260
Rym: Now we're at this point to where even for me, like those distinctions do not matter at all in my use of computers.

747
00:52:54,303 --> 00:52:56,200
Scott: Yeah, no, they don't matter for the person at all.

748
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:02,820
Scott: They just matter for, you know, the underworld of, you know, and there's also just a lot less people like working and thinking about operating systems.

749
00:53:03,441 --> 00:53:10,540
Scott: So they've been very stagnant even while the rest of, you know, that's part of the other problem is hardware and user facing software, right?

750
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:20,600
Scott: All these other parts of the computing landscape have been making progress like there's getting pushed forward, but operating systems are really not moving very much.

751
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,900
Scott: They're sort of still the same as they were years and years ago, right?

752
00:53:25,381 --> 00:53:33,020
Rym: I think the primary, the two things that operating systems matter for users are are either one, what default user experience do you prefer?

753
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:40,980
Rym: And two, what software do you run or hardware do you use that is supported or not supported on the platform that operating system implies?

754
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,566
Scott: Yep, that's pretty much it, right?

755
00:53:43,707 --> 00:53:46,578
Scott: It's like, I need to, why do I have the computer?

756
00:53:46,638 --> 00:53:47,060
Scott: It's a tool.

757
00:53:47,422 --> 00:53:48,570
Scott: What do you want to do with this tool?

758
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:49,980
Scott: I want to accomplish these things.

759
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,379
Scott: These are the things that I do and care about the most.

760
00:53:52,921 --> 00:53:56,512
Scott: All right, well, but the software that you're using is this, this, and this.

761
00:53:57,374 --> 00:53:58,939
Scott: Does it run on this operating system?

762
00:53:59,179 --> 00:53:59,340
Scott: Yes.

763
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:00,727
Scott: Does it run on this other one?

764
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:01,149
Scott: No.

765
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:02,940
Scott: Well, I guess I know which operating system you're choosing.

766
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,044
Scott: It runs on both.

767
00:54:05,204 --> 00:54:05,566
Scott: Okay.

768
00:54:06,329 --> 00:54:07,052
Scott: It runs on both.

769
00:54:07,132 --> 00:54:08,156
Scott: Which one do you like better?

770
00:54:08,759 --> 00:54:09,000
Scott: You know.

771
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:17,400
Rym: I guess I start with upgrades first because in the oldest days, you wouldn't upgrade your operating system, really, because it didn't matter.

772
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,359
Rym: You'd probably replace the hardware before you.

773
00:54:20,042 --> 00:54:25,980
Scott: Yeah, I don't remember if there was actually even an upgrade thing for like until Windows 95.

774
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:38,380
Scott: I think Windows 95 might have been the first that I remember there being an option to like put in the CD-ROM and then say upgrade my current computer to from whatever it is to Windows 95.

775
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:48,280
Scott: It didn't work a lot of times if your computer wasn't just so, but I don't remember an earlier thing where you could upgrade in place.

776
00:54:48,861 --> 00:54:53,410
Rym: Even when you could, like Windows 2000 could, if I recall correctly.

777
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:54,553
Rym: I'm 99% sure it did.

778
00:54:54,593 --> 00:54:55,474
Rym: I didn't trust that at all.

779
00:54:58,580 --> 00:54:59,948
Rym: And I did a clean install of Windows 2000.

780
00:54:59,948 --> 00:55:02,020
Scott: Yeah, they had the feature, but I didn't trust it.

781
00:55:03,681 --> 00:55:14,740
Scott: And also because the way PCs are structured, your operating system was so tied in with disk partitioning and that sort of thing because you had to get the boot record in there and all that nonsense.

782
00:55:15,721 --> 00:55:25,200
Scott: Basically, I always have and still do have a separate disk and/or partition where the operating system and its files live alone with nothing else.

783
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:33,400
Scott: And that way, if I have to reinstall the operating system or anything like that, I don't lose my data, which is all in other disks and other partitions.

784
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:37,628
Scott: I can just delete the operating system, reinstall it, no problems.

785
00:55:38,049 --> 00:55:43,620
Scott: I've just always done it that way because that used to be the way and I still do it that way.

786
00:55:44,361 --> 00:55:44,742
Scott: You know what?

787
00:55:44,922 --> 00:55:54,040
Rym: I would say, if you make your own computer, it still is the way because it has saved me hassles so many times, even in recent memory, to do it that way.

788
00:55:54,160 --> 00:56:00,379
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I just upgraded to Windows 11 with no fear because I'm like, if this doesn't work, I'll just erase that disk completely.

789
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,316
Rym: And install Windows 10 again and like no harm, no foul.

790
00:56:03,336 --> 00:56:04,060
Scott: Reinstall some games.

791
00:56:04,141 --> 00:56:05,559
Scott: It'll take me not much time at all.

792
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:08,920
Rym: Like reinstall Steam, all the data files are already there, like okay.

793
00:56:09,886 --> 00:56:11,979
Scott: Yep, it's really good.

794
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,204
Rym: But also one distinction we should make.

795
00:56:15,685 --> 00:56:23,180
Rym: Back then, there weren't really like security updates to operating systems, like incremental updates within a version.

796
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:26,820
Scott: When did Windows Update become a thing?

797
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,080
Rym: I don't even know from memory off the top of my head.

798
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:37,200
Rym: It's easy to forget that there was no reason to upgrade or like update a Windows 3 computer unless you ran into a bug of some kind.

799
00:56:37,501 --> 00:56:41,660
Rym: You weren't on the internet, or if you were, you weren't on an internet like we're on an internet today.

800
00:56:43,941 --> 00:56:47,270
Scott: It does say that it was for Windows 9x and Windows NT.

801
00:56:47,431 --> 00:56:48,112
Scott: Oh yeah, that one.

802
00:56:48,152 --> 00:56:48,734
Scott: I remember that.

803
00:56:49,015 --> 00:56:50,820
Scott: Okay, I've seen that GUI before.

804
00:56:53,761 --> 00:56:58,261
Scott: Windows Update was introduced as a web app with the launch of Windows 98.

805
00:56:58,261 --> 00:56:59,084
Scott: I remember now.

806
00:56:59,405 --> 00:56:59,946
Scott: That's right.

807
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:02,756
Scott: And then they retroactively made it work with 95 and NT4.

808
00:57:04,601 --> 00:57:10,496
Scott: I remember Windows 98, you would go to that website in IE and that's where you would get, yeah, I remember now.

809
00:57:10,997 --> 00:57:12,100
Scott: Not that I see the screenshot.

810
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:26,180
Rym: Yep, but we got to this point to where we hit a point with the internet where you had to upgrade to newer versions of operating systems to be able to get security and hardware updates that were necessary to keep using your computer.

811
00:57:26,782 --> 00:57:32,035
Rym: Like, you can't keep running Windows 2000 today because you're not going to get any updates and you're going to get owned.

812
00:57:32,396 --> 00:57:33,017
Rym: the second.

813
00:57:33,037 --> 00:57:34,100
Rym: that thing touches the internet.

814
00:57:34,961 --> 00:57:37,129
Scott: Well, security updates are one reason.

815
00:57:37,249 --> 00:57:40,300
Scott: Also, that was a time when things were progressing, right?

816
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:42,344
Scott: Computers were getting more powerful.

817
00:57:42,785 --> 00:57:46,874
Scott: The architecture of the operating system had to actually change to keep up.

818
00:57:46,914 --> 00:57:49,760
Scott: It wasn't enough just to add new drivers for the new hardware.

819
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:57,056
Rym: Yeah, Windows 2000 was based on the NT paradigm and they sunset the other Windows crap.

820
00:57:57,196 --> 00:57:59,160
Rym: With an asterisk, we remember Windows Millennium.

821
00:58:02,461 --> 00:58:06,510
Scott: The operating system itself needed to be updated to take advantage of newer hardware.

822
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:10,980
Scott: Things like RAM limits, it's like the operating system couldn't handle more than so much RAM.

823
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:16,549
Scott: It's like, "Oh, we changed from 32-bit computers to 64-bit computers.

824
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:18,472
Scott: I guess they need a new operating system.

825
00:58:18,552 --> 00:58:20,396
Scott: The operating system is a 32-bit operating system.

826
00:58:20,696 --> 00:58:21,518
Scott: You got to fix the whole

827
00:58:21,538 --> 00:58:21,638
Scott: thing.".

828
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:29,433
Rym: But what this meant was, hardware and operating system update cadences tended to be pretty well aligned.

829
00:58:29,474 --> 00:58:31,397
Rym: So, I had a Windows 95 computer.

830
00:58:31,438 --> 00:58:33,281
Rym: It came with Windows 95.

831
00:58:33,281 --> 00:58:37,268
Rym: When we got a new computer, I just installed Windows 2000 on it.

832
00:58:37,448 --> 00:58:40,954
Rym: I did not actually try to upgrade the Windows 95 computer.

833
00:58:41,275 --> 00:58:42,276
Rym: We left it as is.

834
00:58:42,817 --> 00:58:44,280
Rym: That's the kind of thing we would do.

835
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,892
Rym: Our 486, which was running Windows 3.1.1, we never upgraded that.

836
00:58:48,933 --> 00:58:50,277
Rym: We just left Windows 3.1.1 on it forever.

837
00:58:51,981 --> 00:58:53,124
Scott: I upgraded the Windows 3.1.1.

838
00:58:53,124 --> 00:59:00,360
Scott: That computer, when we got it, it had OS/2 warp and Windows 3.1 in a dual boot with PC-DOS situation.

839
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:01,494
Rym: Oh yeah, you had the PC-DOS.

840
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,942
Scott: Because it was an IBM computer, right?

841
00:59:04,263 --> 00:59:07,368
Scott: And I did wipe it and put Windows 95 on it.

842
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:21,610
Scott: And then the computer that I brought to college, the one that I built in the late 90s, the first computer that was my computer, I started with Windows 98 SE, the one that had USB support.

843
00:59:22,491 --> 00:59:27,538
Scott: Or no, I started with 95B, then I went to 98, and then 2000.

844
00:59:27,538 --> 00:59:29,080
Scott: And then that was the end of that computer.

845
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:32,096
Rym: I want to say 95B supported USB, but 95A did not.

846
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:38,300
Scott: Yeah, it went from 95B to 98 to 2000.

847
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,415
Rym: But here, my Windows 95 computer?

848
00:59:40,221 --> 00:59:43,026
Scott: The next computers, I think a lot of them were all XP.

849
00:59:43,427 --> 00:59:45,671
Scott: I did get a Vista at one point.

850
00:59:46,252 --> 00:59:49,157
Scott: And then I think I went from Vista to 7.

851
00:59:49,157 --> 00:59:50,560
Scott: I don't know if I did anything in between.

852
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:57,030
Rym: I know, I went from the Vista era, I had Vista on a laptop, to Linux on the desktop and didn't have any Windows PCs for a long time.

853
00:59:57,371 --> 01:00:03,680
Rym: And then the next Windows PC I built was Windows 7.

854
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,824
Scott: Yeah, XP, Vista, 7.

855
01:00:05,824 --> 01:00:09,450
Scott: I didn't do Windows 8, I went from 7 to 10.

856
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:14,958
Scott: So the current computer I have started with Windows 7, it went to 10, and I just upgraded to 11 yesterday.

857
01:00:17,422 --> 01:00:26,900
Rym: Yep, I cannot upgrade mine to Windows 11, because Windows 11, one, I don't have a TPM module in my CPU, because my CPU is the 6th generation.

858
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:42,140
Rym: But even if I did, or I buy one and stick it into the computer or futz with my motherboard, it's moot, because Windows 11 formally does not support 6th generation Intel CPUs, despite the fact that they perform about as well as current generation Intel CPUs.

859
01:00:42,721 --> 01:00:44,423
Scott: Yeah, I don't think it's a performance issue.

860
01:00:44,563 --> 01:00:47,266
Scott: There's all sorts of other things.

861
01:00:47,306 --> 01:00:58,020
Scott: There was the Spectre and the Meltdown situation, and there were all sorts of other things, like different features being added to the instruction sets and all sorts of things of that nature.

862
01:00:58,701 --> 01:01:10,149
Scott: I think that it's a lot of work for Microsoft to support and guarantee security updates and things working on such a wide variety of CPUs.

863
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:19,376
Scott: I think they've narrowed it down to, "Okay, this covers enough of our target audience to support these ones.

864
01:01:20,377 --> 01:01:23,600
Scott: It's going to be too much work for too few added

865
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:24,020
Scott: sales.".

866
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,322
Scott: They're not selling Windows 11.

867
01:01:26,322 --> 01:01:26,643
Scott: It's free.

868
01:01:26,663 --> 01:01:29,146
Scott: I guess you can buy it.

869
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:34,192
Scott: You can get a free upgrade, though, from 10, if you support it.

870
01:01:34,673 --> 01:01:37,016
Scott: They're just like, "Okay, it's too much work to support

871
01:01:37,056 --> 01:01:37,397
Scott: those.".

872
01:01:38,037 --> 01:01:39,900
Scott: Not that many people have them.

873
01:01:41,241 --> 01:01:42,525
Rym: A ton of people have them.

874
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:47,900
Rym: is this thing that seems to have come out recently, because for various reasons, the i7 6700...

875
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:51,040
Scott: Not enough to be worth it for Microsoft to upgrade.

876
01:01:52,021 --> 01:02:03,580
Rym: But we're in this weird situation where the i7 6700K was the most popular Intel chip of its era, because that was the best price-to-performance ratio for gaming at the time.

877
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:10,480
Rym: So pretty much everyone for a multi-year period was buying this one Intel chip if they were building their own computer.

878
01:02:11,362 --> 01:02:14,100
Scott: My 8700K seems to be over the line, I guess.

879
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:20,300
Rym: But there's also a ton of laptops that use the six generations that just can't upgrade either.

880
01:02:21,161 --> 01:02:35,221
Scott: But unlike operating system updates in the olden days, where you have a software that only works on the new one or the old one or whatever, I just upgraded to Windows 11.

881
01:02:35,221 --> 01:02:38,447
Scott: It's perfectly fine if you can upgrade to it.

882
01:02:39,008 --> 01:02:44,960
Scott: I don't see why you wouldn't, unless you're just one of those people who gets really mad about tiny user interface changes.

883
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,166
Scott: The start button moved from the left to the middle.

884
01:02:47,226 --> 01:02:48,108
Scott: Oh no!

885
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:49,111
Scott: Big deal.

886
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:50,475
Scott: I just pushed the Windows key.

887
01:02:50,495 --> 01:02:51,016
Scott: What does it matter?

888
01:02:51,036 --> 01:02:51,437
Scott: where it is?

889
01:02:51,457 --> 01:02:52,400
Scott: I don't click on it.

890
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:55,704
Scott: But it's basically the same.

891
01:02:55,744 --> 01:02:58,409
Scott: It's 99% the same freaking thing as Windows 10.

892
01:02:58,409 --> 01:03:00,012
Scott: There's no difference.

893
01:03:00,132 --> 01:03:01,555
Scott: It runs all the same software.

894
01:03:01,755 --> 01:03:02,977
Scott: The performance is the same.

895
01:03:03,759 --> 01:03:04,400
Scott: What does it matter?

896
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:10,141
Rym: Windows 10 is going to continue to get security updates and regular updates until 2025.

897
01:03:10,141 --> 01:03:10,927
Scott: For like four more years?

898
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:12,239
Scott: Yeah, four years.

899
01:03:14,003 --> 01:03:19,274
Rym: So the problem is, I think my desktop will still be more than adequate four years from now.

900
01:03:19,935 --> 01:03:20,897
Scott: I hope so.

901
01:03:21,117 --> 01:03:22,280
Rym: I'll figure out what to do by then.

902
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,844
Rym: The GPU is the sole limit on this thing's potential right now.

903
01:03:25,884 --> 01:03:44,398
Scott: Like I said, if for some reason I can no longer get things going on this computer for the tasks I have that are performance intensive, I'll just, if I have to, I'll get the M2, M3 for those tasks and I'll keep this around to do all the things that the M2, M3 and Mac can't do.

904
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:46,864
Rym: Operating system upgrades.

905
01:03:47,124 --> 01:03:49,411
Rym: All that history we talked about is like moot.

906
01:03:49,572 --> 01:03:52,260
Rym: And if you're not worried about old computers, none of that matters anymore.

907
01:03:52,761 --> 01:04:07,673
Rym: So the state of the world today is if you're running Windows or Mac or Android or iOS, the four most used non-chromebook things on earth, then you should pretty much upgrade to the newest versions when you can, if you can.

908
01:04:07,994 --> 01:04:10,000
Rym: And if you can't, stay on the version you're on.

909
01:04:10,821 --> 01:04:16,819
Rym: And it's very incremental and it's not like this earth-shattering change like operating system upgrades used to be.

910
01:04:17,861 --> 01:04:27,480
Scott: One thing that does happen to Mac people who are developers because, you know, the Mac OS like Unix user space is all weird and not great.

911
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:42,180
Scott: I recommend actually, you know, I'm not a big Docker fan, but if you develop on a Mac, I think you should probably just use Docker and/or VMs because, you know, if you don't, and you up a lot of times people at my work, cause I'm like the only not Mac person at work, right?

912
01:04:42,741 --> 01:04:47,310
Scott: A lot of times they update their Mac OS and it breaks all their developer shit, right?

913
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:52,380
Scott: That was installed with the homebrew or whatever, because that's what happens there, right?

914
01:04:53,241 --> 01:04:58,180
Scott: There's nothing wrong with the rest of the operating system or like all their normal functionality is just fine.

915
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:03,573
Scott: But it's like, because, you know, that's not like a part of the, you know, the OS.

916
01:05:03,613 --> 01:05:08,006
Scott: that, you know, Apple is caring and thinking about a lot, especially cause it's not like that.

917
01:05:08,046 --> 01:05:09,753
Scott: homebrew stuff is an Apple thing.

918
01:05:09,833 --> 01:05:11,580
Scott: It's like a third party open source thing.

919
01:05:12,082 --> 01:05:12,283
Scott: Right?

920
01:05:12,383 --> 01:05:13,869
Scott: So they break it and they don't give a crap.

921
01:05:14,211 --> 01:05:16,480
Scott: Like that's not their problem.

922
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:17,020
Rym: Yeah.

923
01:05:17,081 --> 01:05:22,440
Rym: But generally you should just stay on the newest version of the OS as much as you can on pretty much any platform.

924
01:05:23,741 --> 01:05:29,619
Rym: Linux servers get a bit complicated and big mostly cause they're running Linux a lot of the time and Linux.

925
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:36,700
Scott: There's no such thing as like operating, you know, there sort of is, but there usually isn't a such thing as operating system version, right?

926
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:40,751
Scott: The way that most Linux distros, and obviously there's many of them, right?

927
01:05:41,072 --> 01:05:43,840
Scott: Some of them do just, they don't have versions.

928
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,666
Scott: They're just like, okay, we're updating all the time.

929
01:05:45,947 --> 01:05:46,248
Scott: That's it.

930
01:05:46,348 --> 01:05:49,820
Scott: We're just always updating all our different pieces of software all the time.

931
01:05:50,661 --> 01:05:51,342
Scott: That's it, the end.

932
01:05:51,984 --> 01:05:58,220
Scott: But what a lot of them do is they do specify versions like Debian and Ubuntu and those sorts, right?

933
01:05:58,481 --> 01:05:59,563
Scott: And they'll give them names.

934
01:06:00,105 --> 01:06:03,734
Scott: And what happens is they're like, okay, that version, right?

935
01:06:03,914 --> 01:06:06,220
Scott: Has this set of software together.

936
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:16,140
Scott: And then that stuff will all get security updates right together in harmony, but it won't get like, you know, for example, maybe you got Firefox on there.

937
01:06:16,461 --> 01:06:25,400
Scott: They'll keep updating that Firefox right versions with security updates, but they won't bring you up to a newer real Firefox version.

938
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:26,182
Scott: Right.

939
01:06:26,202 --> 01:06:27,185
Scott: They'll keep all those.

940
01:06:27,325 --> 01:06:27,466
Scott: Like.

941
01:06:27,606 --> 01:06:32,580
Scott: we know that this combination of software with these versions together all works nicely.

942
01:06:32,921 --> 01:06:34,143
Scott: We're not going to upgrade anything.

943
01:06:34,183 --> 01:06:35,607
Scott: We're just going to security update you.

944
01:06:36,208 --> 01:06:41,820
Scott: And then to get, you got to go to a newer OS and like explicitly like unlock, right?

945
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:43,264
Scott: The newer set.

946
01:06:43,546 --> 01:06:46,700
Scott: It's like, all right, well, here's a newer set of versions that we know all work together.

947
01:06:47,181 --> 01:06:52,820
Scott: And it's like you intentionally upgrade yourself to that newer set, you know, that's in harmony with itself.

948
01:06:53,722 --> 01:07:02,080
Scott: And some of them, they designate as LTS, which means long term support so that you can stay on that version and keep getting security updates for like five years or longer.

949
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:07,720
Rym: Pro tip, if you have something in production, use the LTS version of whatever Linux distro you care about.

950
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:08,480
Scott: Yep.

951
01:07:08,741 --> 01:07:16,640
Scott: And some of them, they specify just like, yeah, this is just a short term version, which is really something you'd only use on like a desktop computer.

952
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:17,041
Scott: Right.

953
01:07:17,081 --> 01:07:17,281
Scott: Yes.

954
01:07:17,341 --> 01:07:19,265
Scott: It's only going to get support for how long.

955
01:07:19,485 --> 01:07:19,766
Scott: Yeah.

956
01:07:20,147 --> 01:07:27,400
Scott: So in terms of a desktop computer, you're more likely to need the newest versions of things in terms of actually switching operating systems.

957
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:34,660
Rym: I think we can skip a conversation of like trying to move servers from Solaris to Linux or any stuff like that.

958
01:07:35,061 --> 01:07:41,660
Rym: But in terms of desktops or phones or like normal stuff, most people go between Windows and Mac or Mac and Windows.

959
01:07:42,182 --> 01:07:47,740
Rym: But we did both have the experience of going from Windows to Linux on the desktop and from Linux on the desktop back to Windows.

960
01:07:48,500 --> 01:08:11,640
Rym: And I think the thing that I find the most interesting and I have the most to say about that is simply that in the time that Linux on the desktop was ascended and viable, 90% of everything I did on a computer was in a web browser and the remaining 10% were task specific things where I knew of specific open source software that ran on Windows and Linux that could do what I needed.

961
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:17,291
Rym: So the transition was just a matter of learning a new UI that I could customize.

962
01:08:17,371 --> 01:08:17,872
Rym: And that was it.

963
01:08:18,453 --> 01:08:21,819
Rym: Like there was no difference between Windows and Linux in a time when I wasn't gaming.

964
01:08:22,741 --> 01:08:25,529
Scott: It used to be that, you know, all your stuff was files.

965
01:08:25,788 --> 01:08:29,859
Scott: So you'd have to when you switched something, you had to get your files, right?

966
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:42,560
Scott: And then you had to figure out software that could read your files, reorganize them, get the new OS to recognize them, get software again, reinstall the software, all that fine equivalent software that runs on the other OS.

967
01:08:43,201 --> 01:08:47,269
Scott: Nowadays, all your stuff is just in the cloud or at least so much of it is.

968
01:08:47,288 --> 01:08:52,399
Scott: And things can just be downloaded quickly and reinstalled very quickly.

969
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:57,326
Scott: So switching is like, okay, here I am.

970
01:08:57,526 --> 01:08:59,870
Scott: I reinstall the software and my files.

971
01:09:00,210 --> 01:09:01,532
Scott: I don't even really have to move them.

972
01:09:01,912 --> 01:09:06,080
Scott: So most people like don't have files on hard drives the way we nerds do.

973
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,764
Rym: Even between like Windows and like Mac OS today.

974
01:09:10,863 --> 01:09:11,185
Rym: All right.

975
01:09:11,265 --> 01:09:13,027
Rym: Say I've whatever reason bought a new Mac.

976
01:09:13,627 --> 01:09:14,889
Rym: I install Creative Cloud.

977
01:09:15,249 --> 01:09:17,251
Rym: I install all the Adobe apps.

978
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:24,819
Rym: They work the same as they did on Windows, just way slower because I don't have a fancy GPU depending on the circumstances of something specific.

979
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:25,962
Rym: But they work the same.

980
01:09:25,982 --> 01:09:32,493
Rym: The UI is pretty much the same, except for the core user experience aspects of Mac OS and Macs.

981
01:09:32,813 --> 01:09:36,800
Rym: Like a key is slightly different or context menus and things work differently.

982
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:42,849
Scott: Or let's say you're like, you know, you got a Windows computer and Android phone, right?

983
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:44,591
Scott: And all your photos are in what?

984
01:09:44,692 --> 01:09:47,437
Scott: Google Photos, Adobe, right?

985
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:49,220
Scott: You know, something like that Lightroom.

986
01:09:49,741 --> 01:09:50,060
Scott: Okay.

987
01:09:50,201 --> 01:09:51,381
Scott: So now you decide to switch.

988
01:09:51,403 --> 01:09:57,049
Scott: You go, you throw all your PC and your Android phones in the trash and you get yourself an iPhone and you get a MacBook.

989
01:09:57,249 --> 01:09:57,570
Scott: Okay.

990
01:09:57,950 --> 01:09:58,691
Scott: What do you install?

991
01:09:59,011 --> 01:09:59,452
Scott: Lightroom?

992
01:09:59,952 --> 01:10:00,673
Scott: Google Photos?

993
01:10:00,793 --> 01:10:01,674
Scott: There's all your photos.

994
01:10:01,734 --> 01:10:05,258
Scott: You can move them over to iCloud if you want to, to go to iCloud photos.

995
01:10:05,319 --> 01:10:06,560
Scott: But there they are.

996
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,682
Rym: So I did exactly the two.

997
01:10:08,742 --> 01:10:17,713
Rym: things I had to deal with when I moved from a long time, like deep in Android user to an iOS user was just one.

998
01:10:17,733 --> 01:10:24,040
Rym: I had to just get the muscle memory of the way the gestures and things work in the default user experience.

999
01:10:24,601 --> 01:10:27,645
Rym: Android uses different gestures, different like patterns.

1000
01:10:27,905 --> 01:10:34,094
Rym: It took me about a week to stop constantly trying to hit the back button because in Android you tend to just hit the back button a lot.

1001
01:10:34,475 --> 01:10:36,457
Rym: In iOS it's like a different interface.

1002
01:10:37,058 --> 01:10:38,320
Rym: But after a week I was fine.

1003
01:10:38,861 --> 01:10:48,974
Rym: And the other thing I did is I had to, I don't have to talk about apps because 99% of all the apps I use on Android also exist on iOS.

1004
01:10:49,174 --> 01:10:53,560
Rym: The handful that don't are not pertinent to any real competition.

1005
01:10:54,063 --> 01:10:56,599
Scott: Or there's an equivalent different app that you can get.

1006
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:09,499
Rym: Chwasi is not as good on iOS, but that is a weirdo edge case and while it is technically a deficiency of iOS, it is such an edge case that you can deal with it.

1007
01:11:11,161 --> 01:11:14,751
Rym: I can only touch it with up to five fingers on my Android phone.

1008
01:11:15,052 --> 01:11:17,058
Rym: I can have 10 people all on my screen.

1009
01:11:17,078 --> 01:11:17,780
Rym: It totally worked.

1010
01:11:19,761 --> 01:11:39,180
Rym: But I did have to go through all the Android things I did, which was a combination of apps and core Android features, and look at all the core apps and core features of iOS to decide if I wanted to migrate to the Apple way or keep using the thing I used before.

1011
01:11:39,701 --> 01:11:40,484
Rym: Like Google Keep?

1012
01:11:40,784 --> 01:11:45,719
Rym: I'm migrating into the Apple reminder stuff because it works really nicely.

1013
01:11:45,819 --> 01:11:46,140
Scott: I like it.

1014
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:47,259
Scott: I use Google Tasks.

1015
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,944
Rym: Yep, I didn't use Google Tasks yet.

1016
01:11:50,024 --> 01:11:51,026
Scott: I still use Google Keep.

1017
01:11:51,768 --> 01:11:54,915
Rym: So I'm migrating from Google Keep to the iOS note reminder thing.

1018
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:59,100
Scott: Oh, I use Google Keep.

1019
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:01,141
Rym: Yep.

1020
01:12:01,201 --> 01:12:04,735
Rym: Google Keep I really only use for task lists and nothing else at this point.

1021
01:12:05,016 --> 01:12:06,160
Rym: So it's a very easy migration.

1022
01:12:07,182 --> 01:12:10,153
Scott: The other thing Google Keep is I'll share Google Keeps a lot.

1023
01:12:10,193 --> 01:12:11,498
Scott: We've got the grocery list on there.

1024
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:11,880
Scott: It's shared.

1025
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:15,565
Rym: But what else?

1026
01:12:15,605 --> 01:12:16,487
Rym: Everything else just works.

1027
01:12:16,547 --> 01:12:17,710
Rym: What else is different?

1028
01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:21,760
Rym: I looked at Apple Maps for exactly one second.

1029
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:22,479
Scott: Delete that shit.

1030
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:29,313
Rym: And of course I'm using Google Maps, but Google Maps works the same on iOS as it did on Android.

1031
01:12:29,353 --> 01:12:32,298
Rym: The time where they were different is years past.

1032
01:12:32,479 --> 01:12:33,140
Rym: They're the same.

1033
01:12:33,381 --> 01:12:35,453
Scott: That was like iPhone 4 or 5 days.

1034
01:12:35,514 --> 01:12:36,399
Scott: That was so long ago.

1035
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:44,816
Rym: To the point that now there was no transition period other than muscle memory of core user experience, gesture type stuff.

1036
01:12:45,317 --> 01:12:46,520
Rym: Everything is just the same.

1037
01:12:46,840 --> 01:13:02,220
Scott: I think it also just comes down to, as a software developer, if you're not making some really complex kind of software, even if you develop a video game, you make your video game on Unity, right?

1038
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:03,381
Scott: Guess what?

1039
01:13:04,063 --> 01:13:10,260
Scott: It doesn't take much work for a Unity video game to run on the Switch and OS X and iOS and PC.

1040
01:13:11,701 --> 01:13:19,980
Rym: Yet, how come nobody makes games that run on Mac OS, yet those all run on Steam, often another console?

1041
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,225
Scott: There are quite a few games that run on there.

1042
01:13:22,245 --> 01:13:28,879
Scott: It's just this long history and also just the lack of support and the lack of people on there.

1043
01:13:31,261 --> 01:13:38,880
Scott: Game players don't have those and also even if the software did run on their ultra high-end games, they don't have the video card.

1044
01:13:41,341 --> 01:13:52,160
Rym: So even now, switching between Windows and Mac OS, let's say, or I guess some people go from Windows to iOS because they give up on a computer entirely and just have an iPad.

1045
01:13:53,500 --> 01:14:03,880
Rym: That's an operating system transition, but like you pointed out, most of the people who do that kind of thing, everything they do exists inside of applications or on the internet or on the cloud.

1046
01:14:04,201 --> 01:14:06,806
Rym: It doesn't actually exist in the platform.

1047
01:14:06,826 --> 01:14:08,450
Rym: They're not using parts of Windows.

1048
01:14:08,690 --> 01:14:13,220
Rym: They don't care about or have a need to use the Microsoft Windows calculator.

1049
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:23,039
Scott: And I think this goes back to what I was saying, you know, what the guy's talk was about is I think the thing he didn't mention, because he was thinking about things from operating system down, right?

1050
01:14:23,079 --> 01:14:23,380
Scott: Hardware.

1051
01:14:24,021 --> 01:14:31,209
Scott: It's like without the users caring about the operating system, users used to need to care about it, right?

1052
01:14:31,809 --> 01:14:41,300
Scott: Because users don't need to care about it anymore, I think that has taken a lot of the pressure off the operating system to be better, right?

1053
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:47,500
Scott: It's like it could be so much better, but it just doesn't matter that it's not because that's not right.

1054
01:14:47,961 --> 01:15:01,920
Rym: Well, also we've gotten to the point where Windows and, well, I guess Microsoft and Apple are adding and like really adding features and focusing on user experience, things to make the operating system do that operating systems didn't do before.

1055
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,004
Rym: I personally find almost no value in a lot of those things.

1056
01:15:05,044 --> 01:15:14,340
Rym: Like Windows has added a ton of stuff to synchronize your phone with your Windows PC and like all these features that I really love to see stats on who uses this stuff.

1057
01:15:15,745 --> 01:15:16,680
Scott: I think almost nobody.

1058
01:15:17,261 --> 01:15:18,659
Rym: I do also suspect almost nobody.

1059
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:26,180
Scott: As soon as I updated to Windows 11, it only took me like two minutes, but I went around and I had to remove a bunch of stuff like that they put in there.

1060
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:32,018
Rym: Oh, even when I installed Windows 10, I had to turn off half the stuff that Windows 10 tried to make me use.

1061
01:15:32,058 --> 01:15:32,800
Rym: that was just worthless.

1062
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:35,960
Scott: Windows 11, to its credit, had less of that sort of stuff.

1063
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:37,742
Rym: That's good, because you know what Windows is to me?

1064
01:15:37,762 --> 01:15:51,260
Rym: I hit a Windows key and I start typing the name of a thing and all I need is for that thing to launch and for a window manager around that thing to not suck and for the hardware I'm using to continue to be usable.

1065
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:53,780
Scott: Yeah, and I need the file explorer.

1066
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:56,039
Rym: Yeah, I do need to be able to look at my files.

1067
01:15:56,860 --> 01:16:03,020
Scott: And WSL, which is not sort of, it's a sort of part of Windows, but sort of not, but I need it because I use it a lot.

1068
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:14,860
Rym: So my only failed operating system transition ever was when I tried to go from Linux on the desktop to Mac OS circa 2007?

1069
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:15,098
Scott: Five, six?

1070
01:16:15,941 --> 01:16:16,468
Rym: Six or seven?

1071
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:16,933
Rym: Maybe six?

1072
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:17,460
Rym: I forget.

1073
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:18,009
Scott: Let me look it up.

1074
01:16:18,131 --> 01:16:18,620
Scott: Let me look it up.

1075
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:19,062
Scott: We can look it up.

1076
01:16:19,082 --> 01:16:22,860
Rym: There's a show where I upload it at like two in the morning.

1077
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:28,000
Scott: I can just see when that computer came out, because you got a Mac Mini Core Solo, so when was that?

1078
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:31,209
Rym: I was going to look up when we did the episode where I spent an hour bitching about it.

1079
01:16:31,590 --> 01:16:34,559
Rym: instead of the show we tried to record using GarageBand.

1080
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:39,898
Scott: The Mac Mini Core Solo, second generation, February '06.

1081
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:41,782
Rym: Alright, so it was '06.

1082
01:16:42,263 --> 01:16:54,467
Rym: So in '06 I tried to transition from Linux on the desktop, which was not a great operating system, making quotes at the time, to an Apple platform

1083
01:16:55,148 --> 01:16:55,489
Scott: rather

1084
01:16:55,529 --> 01:17:00,860
Rym: than go to Windows, because Windows was not a great platform at the time either and there was no PC gaming to speak of at the time.

1085
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:03,609
Scott: Right, it was Windows Vista and it was console gaming season.

1086
01:17:03,629 --> 01:17:06,780
Scott: We were doing a lot of mobile Nintendo gaming.

1087
01:17:07,921 --> 01:17:11,919
Scott: The Wii wasn't quite out yet, but we still had GameCube action going on.

1088
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:14,104
Rym: So I failed.

1089
01:17:14,304 --> 01:17:20,220
Rym: I bounced off of a platform and had to give up and go back to the platform I was using before.

1090
01:17:20,701 --> 01:17:21,884
Rym: But you know why that happened?

1091
01:17:22,405 --> 01:17:27,918
Rym: One, I was using software that could not run on a Mac.

1092
01:17:28,419 --> 01:17:28,920
Rym: Full stop.

1093
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:31,735
Scott: You could have paid for what the...

1094
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:36,235
Rym: No, no, I went from... I was using Audacity.

1095
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:39,362
Rym: And ReSound.

1096
01:17:39,983 --> 01:17:41,346
Rym: And I was using... I forget what it was called.

1097
01:17:41,366 --> 01:17:49,300
Rym: There was a third thing I was using that used the real-time audio subsystem for real-time effects processing.

1098
01:17:49,763 --> 01:17:50,448
Rym: Not ReSound.

1099
01:17:50,468 --> 01:17:51,294
Rym: There was another thing.

1100
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:52,120
Rym: I forget what it was called.

1101
01:17:52,620 --> 01:17:53,185
Rym: R-Door.

1102
01:17:53,628 --> 01:17:54,414
Rym: R-fucking-Door.

1103
01:17:54,636 --> 01:17:55,120
Rym: That's what I used.

1104
01:17:56,260 --> 01:18:00,298
Rym: But I was also... Those applications don't run on Macs.

1105
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:00,780
Rym: Fine.

1106
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:08,400
Rym: But the software that existed on Macs, there was GarageBand, which did not work for what we wanted to do at all.

1107
01:18:09,149 --> 01:18:09,519
Scott: Pro Tools.

1108
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:12,186
Scott: Pro Tools, which was very expensive.

1109
01:18:12,366 --> 01:18:16,777
Rym: And also, while I knew how to use it, I had to use it in RIT extensively.

1110
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:17,599
Rym: I learned how to use it.

1111
01:18:19,981 --> 01:18:22,587
Rym: It was, at the time, not well-suited to what we were doing.

1112
01:18:22,627 --> 01:18:24,331
Rym: But also, I couldn't afford it.

1113
01:18:24,652 --> 01:18:27,980
Rym: And if I could afford it, I was gonna buy Audition instead.

1114
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,040
Rym: If I had money, I was gonna buy...

1115
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:33,154
Scott: You also would have bought a Mac that wasn't the weakest core solo mini one.

1116
01:18:33,174 --> 01:18:34,940
Scott: You would have bought a more powerful Mac if you had money.

1117
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:35,400
Rym: Yep.

1118
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,925
Rym: But effectively, I had a software suite that worked very well.

1119
01:18:38,226 --> 01:18:44,940
Rym: And that software suite did not exist on the platform I wanted to move to, nor did Equivalence exist at the time.

1120
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:45,928
Scott: Yep.

1121
01:18:46,641 --> 01:18:57,520
Rym: So if I had money, it would imagine I would have been going from a Windows computer running Audition to a Mac that was more powerful running Pro Tools.

1122
01:18:57,940 --> 01:19:01,450
Rym: While that would have been a radical change in user experience, that's doable.

1123
01:19:01,791 --> 01:19:04,860
Rym: But I didn't have money, so it ended up being not doable.

1124
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:15,460
Rym: And then games came out, and of course, couldn't run those games on this computer, so I just gave up and I went back to Linux on the desktop just long enough to build a Windows 7 computer.

1125
01:19:18,142 --> 01:19:23,320
Rym: So yeah, that was a broad mishmash of a bunch of different operating system topics, but I think we got it out of our systems.

1126
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:29,249
Scott: But yeah, operating systems are sort of in a weird place right now, right?

1127
01:19:30,011 --> 01:19:34,520
Scott: So if they're worth, I think, as the talk said that you should watch, right?

1128
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:34,653
Scott: Yeah.

1129
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,458
Scott: If they're worth thinking about more, right?

1130
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:39,297
Rym: Well, I think in the old days...

1131
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:40,256
Scott: What their place is.

1132
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:44,888
Rym: We knew, personally, a lot about the operating systems we used.

1133
01:19:44,928 --> 01:19:48,234
Rym: I knew what every option did, even as late as Windows.

1134
01:19:48,594 --> 01:19:52,601
Rym: Even Windows 7, I knew a lot of all the things in Windows 7.

1135
01:19:52,601 --> 01:19:57,259
Rym: I used less and less of the footprint of the operating system directly as the years go on.

1136
01:19:58,281 --> 01:20:02,637
Scott: A lot of it moved in, because a lot of the software is no longer native software either.

1137
01:20:02,697 --> 01:20:03,480
Scott: It's just websites.

1138
01:20:05,361 --> 01:20:07,499
Scott: Like the web browser is the only native application.

1139
01:20:14,270 --> 01:20:16,533
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1140
01:20:16,573 --> 01:20:21,540
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1141
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:26,940
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1142
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:29,907
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1143
01:20:30,027 --> 01:20:34,640
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1144
01:20:34,981 --> 01:20:38,136
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1145
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:42,490
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1146
01:20:42,691 --> 01:20:45,540
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1147
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:52,980
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Heidi McNichol, Ellen Joyce, Linki Iggi, Dread, Lily Tenebrae, and a bunch of people who don't want me to say their names.

1148
01:20:53,100 --> 01:21:01,056
Rym: Chris Reimer, Clinton Walton, Dex, Finn, JustLikeADudeGuy, Chi-Hi85, Rebecca Dunn, Reuben Bedville, 34 Cowards, Ryan Parent, Sam Erickson, Servin' Von Horl,

1149
01:21:01,557 --> 01:21:01,878
Scott: Taylor

1150
01:21:01,898 --> 01:21:09,037
Rym: Braun, The Iron Front, you hold the key to my heart, and a whole bunch of other people who don't want me to say their names, and now tonight I leave you with...

1151
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:14,700
Scott: The Big Top got a little smaller today, and the world got a little less funny.

1152
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:18,059
Rym: Buggles the Glue Clown has told his last joke.

1153
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:21,150
Scott: Sovereign has called an emergency meeting.

1154
01:21:21,231 --> 01:21:23,240
Rym: To a point, Councilman Force replacement.

1155
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:26,452
Scott: His name was Buggles, you chromium crossbreed!

1156
01:21:26,733 --> 01:21:28,400
Scott: Stuff your meeting, I'm mourning here!

1157
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:30,771
Scott: My apologies, RedMantle Dragoon Hybrid.

1158
01:21:31,133 --> 01:21:32,380
Scott: I know you men were close.

1159
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:33,344
Scott: They were close.

1160
01:21:33,464 --> 01:21:34,769
Rym: I never much cared for the man.

1161
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:37,540
Rym: I found his jokes tedious, his riddles obvious.

1162
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:39,165
Rym: The two of you, honestly!

1163
01:21:39,406 --> 01:21:43,100
Rym: You hate Buggles so much, why don't you go over there with those dicks?

1164
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:45,687
Scott: It was Buggles' last wish that I read this.

1165
01:21:46,751 --> 01:21:49,240
Scott: To Captain Sunshine, my long-time nemesis.

1166
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:55,314
Scott: What kind of jag won't help you fix a flat, or score a royal flush, or plug your phone in?

1167
01:21:55,555 --> 01:21:57,460
Scott: The answer may surprise you.

1168
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:57,965
Rym: Oops.
