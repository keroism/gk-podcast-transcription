Rym: Right about now.

7
00:00:29,314 --> 00:00:32,145
Scott: Well, I mean you would say woman but the thing is it's not actually cold.

8
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:32,989

00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:38,664
Scott: No, not really quite warm.

11
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:39,406
Scott: No, it's not.

12
00:00:39,747 --> 00:00:40,288
Rym: Oh my god.

13
00:00:40,328 --> 00:00:41,050
Rym: I was in Rochester.

14
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:44,069
Rym: You were here and snowed snowed a lot.

15
00:00:44,855 --> 00:00:45,309
Scott: What's that?

16
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:51,147
Rym: I wonder if the snow in Rochester is higher or lower than there was basically no snow until we got to about.

17
00:00:52,493 --> 00:00:53,861
Rym: So the Tappan Zee.

18
00:00:54,163 --> 00:00:55,410
Scott: so on the return trip.

19
00:00:55,832 --> 00:00:58,970
Scott: So you don't really know how much snow is in Rochester because you left before the snow arrived.

20
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,701
Rym: I think the snow really got that bad out there.

21
00:01:00,842 --> 00:01:02,070
Rym: Let's really just the city.

22
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,730
Rym: But anyway, you know, we made it through all this crazy snow.

23
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:10,446
Rym: We are three blocks from the apartment and we get stuck.

24
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:11,450
Rym: actually we're not stuck.

25
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:12,058
Rym: We're fine.

26
00:01:12,221 --> 00:01:18,910
Rym: in front of us This livery car is stuck and around it our cabs and other cars all stuck and we couldn't get around him.

27
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,276
Rym: So we parked on the sidewalk and gave up.

28
00:01:20,517 --> 00:01:26,250
Scott: It looks like there was plenty of snow in Rochester according to the weather report Not only yours as much snow as we got here.

29
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:27,214
Scott: Apparently it's gonna.

30
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:30,347
Scott: it's still snowing there and it's gonna continue snowing there for a couple days here.

31
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:30,548
Scott: What's it?

32
00:01:30,588 --> 00:01:31,090
Scott: We're already done.

33
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:32,518
Rym: Yeah, we got just the drifting.

34
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,255
Rym: Yeah, but much more important Winter classics coming up.

35
00:01:36,817 --> 00:01:40,549
Scott: Yeah, I don't think people really know but there's a new tradition of the NHL.

36
00:01:41,171 --> 00:01:45,365
Scott: Is that on New Year's Day to compete with the bowl games the college footballs?

37
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,750
Rym: Yeah, we have a real men's sport.

38
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,540
Scott: Yeah, they put out and they they have one hockey game.

39
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,704
Scott: That is outside.

40
00:01:51,844 --> 00:01:55,214
Scott: Holy crap outside hockey Real man hockey.

41
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:59,490
Scott: It's mostly the same as inside hockey, but basically they make a rink.

42
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:00,035
Scott: So it's.

43
00:02:00,196 --> 00:02:01,689
Scott: it's not like it's on a lake.

44
00:02:02,091 --> 00:02:04,339
Scott: It's not as badass as it could be see.

45
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:07,470
Rym: the thing is though watching NHL players play outside.

46
00:02:08,014 --> 00:02:09,949
Rym: They're not used to things like glare.

47
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:12,378
Scott: Well, yeah, the Sun is gonna be out.

48
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,348
Scott: They're not used to the incredible.

49
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:15,293
Scott: It's gonna.

50
00:02:15,313 --> 00:02:16,441
Scott: you know, it's gonna sell out.

51
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:17,630
Scott: this thing always sells out.

52
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:18,535
Scott: It's been going for a few.

53
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,974
Rym: the ice surface is way different in the Sun, too So it's much louder.

54
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:25,248
Scott: the surface is different even though it is professionally maintained.

55
00:02:25,288 --> 00:02:26,813
Rym: with all the right You got that sunlight.

56
00:02:26,853 --> 00:02:26,954
Rym: it's.

57
00:02:27,054 --> 00:02:32,550
Scott: it's actually surprisingly more slippery and the temperature and the wind also becomes effective.

58
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:38,370
Scott: Yeah wind so, you know, it's not even though it's not on a pond with no wall around it.

59
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,116
Scott: Like really like, you know badasses.

60
00:02:40,718 --> 00:02:41,983
Scott: It's it's still pretty good.

61
00:02:42,003 --> 00:02:45,782
Rym: I Just don't think a lot of our friends quite appreciate it.

62
00:02:45,802 --> 00:02:47,150
Rym: We're even like none of our friends.

63
00:02:47,613 --> 00:02:49,790
Scott: See, none of our friends really appreciate sports.

64
00:02:49,850 --> 00:03:12,450
Scott: That's why I think that a lot of people listen to this show might get the impression that we care about sports a lot more Than we do, but I think it's really just that we talk about sports on the show More, you know more often than we do in real life in order to sort of get people to realize like hey geekery and sports Are not these mutually exclusive things, you know, you don't need to be hating on sports to be a geek.

65
00:03:12,531 --> 00:03:15,610
Scott: In fact, it's good to like some or all of them.

66
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:15,930
Rym: You know what?

67
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:24,710
Rym: I always say the guy who's memorized all the lookup tables for hit locations in mech warrior or Battle tech is the same as the guy who memorized all the stats for his football team.

68
00:03:24,991 --> 00:03:26,295
Scott: Yeah, exactly and go look up.

69
00:03:26,315 --> 00:03:30,347
Scott: They got some freakin nerdy ass stats going on these days, right?

70
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:37,730
Scott: They're like, oh no No, you can't judge by that in especially baseball baseball is the most stats nerdiness of any of any of the sports.

71
00:03:38,193 --> 00:03:38,919
Scott: You know,

72
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:46,415
Rym: it's funny to me that our crew, you know we're having our annual front row crew New Year's bash in the city this time and We post the thing like who

73
00:03:46,455 --> 00:03:46,796
Scott: wants to

74
00:03:46,837 --> 00:03:54,270
Rym: go do karaoke and who wants to watch the winter classic and I think Gonna be me and Scott and Andrew watching the winter classic and everybody else.

75
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,889
Scott: Nobody appreciates the ice hockey.

76
00:03:58,152 --> 00:04:01,909
Rym: You think they went to RIT, but then again who went to the hockey games with us?

77
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:11,874
Rym: It was you and me and like two or three other people who were regulars like Emily Yuko would come when she could and Greg would come Stop coming.

78
00:04:11,914 --> 00:04:17,350
Rym: Yeah, Alex went once twice, but now most of the crew didn't actually go to all the RIT hockey game.

79
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,599
Scott: I went to every single one.

80
00:04:18,619 --> 00:04:26,930
Scott: I was able to yep In fact, we've stopped playing Crystal Chronicles to go to the hockey game and then we came back and we still beat it in time.

81
00:04:27,237 --> 00:04:34,270
Rym: Yep So, yeah, you got any news because I kind of want to get right to the main bit of the predictions because I'm kind of.

00:04:40,895 --> 00:04:41,620
Rym: Want to get done with this?

85
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:42,266

Scott: That was pretty interesting, you know, cuz I'm not at work.

88
00:04:47,151 --> 00:04:49,066
Scott: But so, you know, I'm looking at the internet.

94
00:04:58,351 --> 00:05:00,785
Scott: No, I'm actually looking at a lot less internets looking at almost no internets.

95
00:05:00,805 --> 00:05:01,570
Rym: Cuz he's doing stuff.

96
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:06,490
Scott: Yeah, because looking at internets The only reason I look at it so much is cuz I'm in at work if I'm not working.

97
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,901
Scott: That's the only thing there is to do.

Rym: I play counter-strike like every day lately.

113
00:05:43,284 --> 00:05:47,782
Scott: I finished building the robot I was working on and I started designing that board game that we were talking about.

114
00:05:47,802 --> 00:05:48,705

Rym: Well, you know, we got to do.

119
00:05:55,371 --> 00:05:56,414
Rym: We always make the mistake.

120
00:05:56,455 --> 00:06:00,888
Rym: We have to make the POC the simplest dumbass game.

121
00:06:00,908 --> 00:06:01,530
Scott: That's what I did.

122
00:06:02,281 --> 00:06:02,728
Rym: Is it done?

123
00:06:03,853 --> 00:06:05,144
Scott: It's really simple and dumbass.

124
00:06:05,185 --> 00:06:07,693
Rym: But yeah That's not gonna make the.

125
00:06:08,255 --> 00:06:10,221
Rym: well I got to make a Firefox plug-in.

126
00:06:10,261 --> 00:06:13,089
Rym: that basically is the front end for that delicious thing.

127
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:20,049
Rym: Mm-hmm, our box plugins, by the way for anyone out there who's you know a techie, but you don't make stuff way easy to make.

128
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,483
Scott: I also got to do chrome plugins.

129
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:26,887
Rym: In fact Chrome extensions 99% of making a Firefox plug-in is actually not plugins.

130
00:06:26,927 --> 00:06:27,770
Scott: extensions different.

131
00:06:28,052 --> 00:06:30,589
Rym: Yeah, designing the UI to look good.

132
00:06:30,871 --> 00:06:32,536
Rym: Yeah, that's pretty much.

133
00:06:32,596 --> 00:06:36,990
Scott: all we need to do is have a button a couple buttons in the toolbar with yeah with icons.

134
00:06:37,091 --> 00:06:40,389
Rym: I'm not even worried about like the integration of getting the bookmarks back or any of that.

135
00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:46,028
Rym: yet I pretty much just want first I want to make the make a bookmark cuz that's I use that more than they look at my bookmarks

136
00:06:46,128 --> 00:06:55,820
Scott: exactly anyway, so In this news the only one of the only interesting internet tech news I saw today Is that Putin the president?

137
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,639
Scott: Well the Prime Minister of Russia the king of Russia Scott is he who's?

138
00:07:01,494 --> 00:07:02,600
Rym: You know Mevdev is right?

139
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,424
Rym: Yeah, he's.

140
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,610
Scott: technically he's the president.

141
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:10,030
Scott: It's one of those countries where they have the you know president and prime minister and it's like well who's really in charge?

142
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:10,471
Scott: You're what?

143
00:07:10,532 --> 00:07:12,658
Rym: well, you know, we'll use the authoritative source.

144
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:13,782
Rym: according to WikiLeaks.

145
00:07:13,982 --> 00:07:15,266
Rym: Putin is in charge of everything.

146
00:07:15,387 --> 00:07:16,430
Scott: exactly what I was saying.

147
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:19,940
Scott: So he gave an order right?

148
00:07:20,442 --> 00:07:22,009
Scott: I think the shows he's in charge of everything.

149
00:07:22,472 --> 00:07:26,450
Scott: He ordered a Russian move to Linux, right?

150
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:29,760
Scott: So, I mean Germany sort of did this and it failed.

151
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,110
Scott: All right, if I remember correctly or was it one city in Germany?

152
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,322
Scott: I don't remember exactly but wasn't it Munich?

153
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:36,510
Scott: I don't think so.

154
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:41,030
Scott: There was you know, there's some sort of thing like all right, we're gonna do it and then it was not going it.

155
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:48,050
Scott: So well, but apparently he you know, this is tried to happen in many times in Russia before to limited success.

156
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:48,794
Scott: But now what?

157
00:07:49,015 --> 00:07:58,436
Scott: because you know, the king gave the order The odds are is that it's actually gonna go through and they're actually gonna you know Start moving their butts.

158
00:07:58,517 --> 00:08:07,054
Scott: and there's a whole plan, you know a five-year plan to get this done between the years of 2011 and 2015 20 forever.

159
00:08:07,315 --> 00:08:10,563
Scott: Yeah, so, you know, this is gonna be pretty interesting to see.

160
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,448
Scott: you know a do they actually do it?

161
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:14,075
Scott: B What comes of it?

162
00:08:14,557 --> 00:08:16,989
Scott: see how long it takes because what it could be?

163
00:08:17,591 --> 00:08:23,565
Rym: It's a situation that America cannot have with our current government of the dog and ho the.

164
00:08:23,926 --> 00:08:29,286
Rym: let's do the right thing Technologically and force it down everyone's throats whether they like it or not.

165
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:35,630
Rym: Yep I don't know if it'll work though because Russia does not have a stellar history of technological prowess.

166
00:08:35,831 --> 00:08:41,169
Scott: Well, no, actually the problem is I think it's sort of it's hard to figure out like what the reason for this is like.

167
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,583
Scott: Okay, obviously saving money in the government, you know, good idea, right?

168
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,230
Scott: Always a good to be openness.

169
00:08:46,571 --> 00:08:50,865
Scott: You know for the people it's still a good idea right not being dependent upon a u.s.

170
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,230
Rym: Centric OS company.

171
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,567
Scott: Yeah, very good idea, right?

172
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,737
Scott: Russia is where all the hackers are at.

173
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,615
Scott: So you want to secure up against them, right and Maybe they'll come work for you.

174
00:09:00,696 --> 00:09:01,418
Scott: If you're all cool.

175
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:14,398
Rym: Also think of this a move like this will basically trickle down through the education system and certifications and Right now we have the situation where if you want a shitty Windows administrator You can pay him like 12 bucks an hour.

176
00:09:14,438 --> 00:09:15,241
Rym: They're a dime a dozen.

177
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:19,058
Rym: even if you want a shitty Linux administrator They're scarily hard to come by.

178
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:21,330
Scott: Yep, very hard, you know and a good one.

179
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:27,112
Scott: What you're gonna do is you're gonna get a Windows guy who's gonna search Google and copy and paste which up or you're gonna get One of those.

180
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:34,587
Rym: I have a Red Hat certification and then he sits down he types service HTTPd start and it doesn't work and he doesn't know what to do.

181
00:09:37,574 --> 00:09:38,639
Rym: Like you ever seen the Etsy?

182
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:39,805
Rym: do you even know what's in Etsy?

183
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:43,323
Scott: do you even know Even know what I what I mean when I say Etsy.

184
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:44,549
Scott: Oh, yeah, that's like they sell crafts.

185
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:49,237
Rym: Do you install everything in user local?

186
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,990
Scott: maybe opt like you install things in places.

187
00:09:58,156 --> 00:09:58,528
Scott: That's it.

188
00:09:59,153 --> 00:10:00,097
Rym: That was the question.

189
00:10:00,117 --> 00:10:07,828
Rym: an unnamed person at an unnamed former company I worked for asked me when I was trying to like get him to administer some stuff so I could work in other things.

190
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:13,209
Rym: and He asked me and I quote so Where did you install Apache?

191
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,270
Scott: Yeah, I mean this is that that's the kind of question.

192
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:18,819
Rym: The answer would have been you're fired.

193
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,750
Scott: Yeah, I mean when someone asked that question, right?

194
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,721
Scott: It's obvious that they come from Windows background.

195
00:10:23,741 --> 00:10:25,370
Scott: because you install anything on Windows.

196
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:30,370
Scott: The number one thing is the location in the file system where you are installing it, right?

197
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,064
Rym: No, they've gone down a road of things are still monolithic, but at least they're all in.

198
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:34,486
Rym: you know.

199
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:39,646
Scott: program files Yeah, but in you know in the Unix Linux world, it doesn't.

200
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,053
Rym: that's not how well It is.

201
00:10:41,093 --> 00:10:48,130
Rym: for a lot of enterprise stuff to a lot of things are just and a lot of stuff I install ends up because of the bullshit enterprise proprietary stuff.

202
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:58,090
Rym: It's got a user local install with its own like Sun Java Jerry that only it uses because it wants some busted ass old version And it wants its own busted ass libraries for everything.

203
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,620
Rym: I don't know why people fucking do that shit because they don't know better.

204
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,050
Scott: I wouldn't I wouldn't use something if they were so shitty.

205
00:11:03,572 --> 00:11:05,018
Rym: Yeah, I wish I had that option.

206
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,500
Rym: Yeah.

207
00:11:05,802 --> 00:11:06,003
Rym: Yeah.

208
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:07,710
Rym: Anyway, I'm getting there though.

209
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:13,930
Rym: No, I'm working on secret projects, you know all my complaints about enterprise software and how shitty it is.

210
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,156
Scott: He's gonna replace it all.

211
00:11:15,256 --> 00:11:22,005
Rym: I got one enterprise vendor where I was like look You were one of a small number of people who make this product.

212
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,310
Rym: Here's the list of what I want.

213
00:11:23,411 --> 00:11:25,247
Rym: you don't do it and neither does anyone else.

214
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:33,220
Rym: and Instead of saying price discount, which is basically what I was going for from all these people I expected to pay less for the same shit.

215
00:11:33,521 --> 00:11:34,626
Rym: These guys were like, well write it.

216
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,289
Rym: You're right Your design is better than a. well, let's do it.

217
00:11:41,051 --> 00:11:45,168
Scott: Coming along so far so good really that did they actually show you something that was made.

218
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:45,770
Rym: they gay.

219
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:47,137
Rym: I have a debt of her they get.

220
00:11:47,197 --> 00:11:56,048
Rym: I have a beta version of the product that Implemented a lot of what I wanted pretty quick and the guys actually like I'm working with their developers like directly.

221
00:11:56,128 --> 00:11:56,790
Scott: They're not stupid.

222
00:11:56,911 --> 00:11:57,795
Rym: No, they're not stupid.

223
00:11:57,895 --> 00:11:59,261
Scott: Oh my god is amazing.

224
00:11:59,281 --> 00:11:59,482
Scott: Okay.

225
00:11:59,502 --> 00:12:01,130
Scott: This is a public company odd now.

226
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:04,488
Rym: Ticketing systems.

227
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:05,976
Rym: Suffice it to say.

228
00:12:06,136 --> 00:12:07,964
Rym: I'm not anywhere yet, but I'm working on it.

229
00:12:08,265 --> 00:12:14,790
Scott: Anyway, yeah No, this is this is gonna be interesting and I am going to be very curious to see how this goes.

230
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:30,610
Rym: Well one well now I don't want to get into my political views, but I feel like this sort of thing with technology is impossible to do in the US but it could Revolutionize American government more so than just about anything else just forcing technology to be updated.

231
00:12:31,072 --> 00:12:34,990
Rym: Yeah, even if we update it to crappy stuff it'll at least put it on everyone's radar.

232
00:12:35,832 --> 00:12:39,229
Scott: I just want to refer to my extremely old thing of the day which shows dog and home.

233
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:41,385
Scott: No, Hillary Clinton being asked about firefight.

234
00:12:41,446 --> 00:12:42,010
Rym: Oh my god.

235
00:12:44,092 --> 00:12:44,734
Rym: But the thing is.

236
00:12:45,257 --> 00:12:48,912
Rym: what was beautiful about that video was heard the expression on her face She smiled.

237
00:12:48,952 --> 00:12:54,750
Rym: that smile of I don't know what you just said and I'm going to stall until someone fixes this for me.

238
00:12:55,011 --> 00:13:03,350
Scott: Well, the only thing that was reassuring about the video was just how many people in the audience were like, yeah Even normal people who know nothing about computers.

239
00:13:03,631 --> 00:13:10,090
Rym: Remember that their nephew said something about using that firebird thing because the IE thing with the blue thing is bad.

240
00:13:10,636 --> 00:13:11,689
Rym: Yeah, I know that much.

241
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:18,690
Scott: I think it's definitely right a Situation where we're getting to the point where it's like think about the olden days, right?

242
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:26,430
Scott: You would go into a factory and the people who worked on the factory floor They had to do this repetitive task over and over so they mastered it, right?

243
00:13:26,691 --> 00:13:32,375
Scott: But then the big guys on top would come down and say oh do it this way We know better.

244
00:13:32,475 --> 00:13:33,438
Rym: look at the old trope.

245
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:45,049
Rym: when they don't know of the factory worker or the engineer who you know The big boss says do it this way He says okay, and then he hacked something together on his own because he knows better and the foreman knows he knows better He doesn't say anything.

246
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:51,310
Scott: So I think you know, if you look at offices even though most people have no idea of anything about computers, right?

247
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:55,130
Scott: They still you know, they maybe they try out Chrome and it's so fast.

248
00:13:55,270 --> 00:14:00,910
Scott: So they you know, that's they can tell that right away or outlook crashes and their Gmail always works, right?

249
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,579
Scott: And they know that even though they're not computer experts.

250
00:14:04,181 --> 00:14:07,090
Scott: They know, you know something, you know, they have that intuition.

251
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:12,390
Scott: They know that something's better or they like something better and they have a preference whereas the people on top are you know?

252
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,217
Scott: Executive types who are using.

253
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:26,717
Scott: they use a blackberry because all they do is email all day and outlook So they never use anything else so that you know That's all they want in the whole world and that so that result is that everyone below them has to use the same Stuff, even though it's worse for them.

254
00:14:26,797 --> 00:14:27,078
Rym: Of course.

255
00:14:27,098 --> 00:14:27,600
Rym: We have a weird.

256
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,965
Rym: it's a two-way situation.

257
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:30,290
Rym: I'd say half the workers.

258
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:37,162
Rym: I'm it's not actually half but there's two classes of the kind of the factory workers of the IT white-collar world.

259
00:14:37,223 --> 00:14:41,262
Rym: half of them Don't know shit and they want to do things an old busted way.

260
00:14:41,563 --> 00:14:46,330
Scott: and if people above them try to make them change they just Well, I don't say what the IT work is now at the regular office workers.

261
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,541
Rym: Oh, even the regular office workers half of them.

262
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:55,870
Rym: You just can't change anything Or they just they can't deal with it, but the other half know better but the people above them won't let them change.

263
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,216
Rym: Mm-hmm, you know like.

264
00:14:57,256 --> 00:15:00,110
Rym: imagine the kid who gets a job like over the summer.

265
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,545
Rym: We're as a clerk somewhere and his boss is like I need you to do the time sheets.

266
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:11,208
Rym: Here's the Excel macro That connects to our excess database And you know better.

267
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:19,254
Rym: There is no way you will be able to convince your boss that the MySQL thing you wrote in ten minutes is better I'll write it into.

268
00:15:19,314 --> 00:15:20,157
Scott: actually just do it.

269
00:15:20,358 --> 00:15:21,322
Scott: I'll write it in ten minutes.

270
00:15:21,362 --> 00:15:23,190
Scott: I'll just use it and that'll be that.

271
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,717
Rym: Yeah, but then what's coming out of that?

272
00:15:24,938 --> 00:15:26,706
Rym: the Excel spreadsheet that the boss wants.

273
00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:29,820
Rym: Yeah Yeah, so well that seat the thing is.

274
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,724
Rym: that's the brilliant part.

275
00:15:30,744 --> 00:15:37,287
Rym: the really good people Ignore the incompetent bosses work around it with technology and have infinite free time at work.

276
00:15:37,748 --> 00:15:44,530
Rym: Mm-hmm That's why we sit looking at the internet all the time Yep, so I want to talk about this really briefly because you know Russia and everything.

277
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:56,410
Rym: It's interesting that Stuxnet that virus that was may or may not have been written by the Israelis Supposedly seems to have actually taken out physical hardware in Iran's nuclear program.

278
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:56,913
Scott: I thought that.

279
00:15:57,013 --> 00:15:58,662
Scott: you know, I didn't think that was news.

280
00:15:59,325 --> 00:15:59,667
Rym: It's new.

281
00:15:59,788 --> 00:16:01,111
Rym: basically It's.

282
00:16:01,312 --> 00:16:01,875
Rym: it wasn't sure.

283
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:05,009
Rym: it was all speculation and the speculation has become much more firm.

284
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:05,893
Scott: Well, I mean there wasn't.

285
00:16:05,914 --> 00:16:07,340
Scott: I did you know it.

286
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,345
Scott: there was speculation.

287
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:09,490
Scott: I mean who would be speculating?

288
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:13,446
Scott: It's like oh we think this thing did this but you know if nothing happened.

289
00:16:13,466 --> 00:16:14,290
Scott: Well, it's like well, how do you?

290
00:16:15,234 --> 00:16:17,933
Rym: Well, there there is a lot of precedent for this I mean remember the u.s.

291
00:16:18,013 --> 00:16:22,025
Rym: Sabotage that Russian gas pipeline back in the Soviet era.

292
00:16:22,286 --> 00:16:22,827
Rym: Mm-hmm.

293
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:23,529
Rym: You know about that, right?

294
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:29,768
Rym: Kinda, basically we knew the Russians were trying to steal control software for this big gas pipeline.

295
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:33,243
Scott: Wow Why couldn't you just tell me how complicated could that be?

296
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,609
Rym: This is a long time ago Soviet Union All right.

297
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,700
Rym: So we the u.s.

298
00:16:37,921 --> 00:16:43,184
Rym: Planted bad Evil software that we knew they would find and steal.

299
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:44,570
Rym: they did steal it.

300
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:47,038
Rym: They used it not long that long later.

301
00:16:47,158 --> 00:16:56,850
Rym: It caused one of the biggest non-nuclear explosions in the history of the world uh-huh, and That was considered a successful intelligence operation and Stuxnet is basically a similar thing.

302
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:02,368
Rym: Supposedly it took out about a thousand IR one centrifuges that Iran was using to enrich uranium.

303
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,505
Rym: All right My what's it?

304
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:12,150
Rym: Well, we'll talk about this again in the main show because you know We're talking about predictions and I think Scott has a prediction along these lines, but I posit a theory.

305
00:17:13,192 --> 00:17:26,804
Rym: I do not believe that Israel actually wrote this and deployed it because I don't think Iran is that technologically incompetent and I don't think it would be that easy to get a Virus on the computer on the computers that control the centrifuges that would do it.

306
00:17:27,185 --> 00:17:27,989
Rym: Yeah, I mean little.

307
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,310
Scott: yeah I mean, how would you specifically get a specific virus under us?

308
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:37,795
Scott: I mean, it's one thing to put a virus on the internet in general and then it's gonna get a bunch of Windows PCs But you don't know which ones.

309
00:17:37,855 --> 00:17:44,225
Scott: but to target specific computers of the specific virus You need to have a specific person who's gonna eat it.

310
00:17:44,245 --> 00:17:45,532
Scott: You need to target it somehow.

311
00:17:45,572 --> 00:17:53,730
Scott: you need to either put it on a website that you know a Particular person goes time, but then you have an inside person it physically install again.

312
00:17:54,051 --> 00:17:58,290
Rym: You know to play my own devil's advocate you could do this with old-school intelligence.

313
00:17:58,451 --> 00:18:10,570
Rym: You know leaving USB sticks at the factory around things like that having agent Yeah, but you have to have someone in there Yeah, which is you know, I'm pretty sure Israel would be able to arrange something like that anyway.

314
00:18:11,272 --> 00:18:16,466
Rym: But my speculation is much simpler because the way these documents are leaking and the things Iran has said.

315
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:40,540
Rym: I would wager That Iran's government needs an excuse to not have made the bomb Because if they actually have Workwhile working nuclear weapons The people that they are pacifying with their nuclear program will be angry that they are not threatening to use them or actually using them Mm-hmm, and the government Ahmadinejad is not a stupid man.

316
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:43,088
Rym: And I I. this is why you should.

317
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,690
Rym: he's pretty crazy Yeah, but this is wild speculation.

318
00:18:46,092 --> 00:19:09,088
Rym: I would speculate that even if this was an Israeli thing or whatever, you know If there's just a targeted attack from the outside Even if it failed it is in Iran's vested interest to act as though it succeeded and blame enemies of the state for delaying their nuclear program thus giving them an excuse to not actually have a working nuclear program and yet Simultaneously get all the benefits of saying that you have one

319
00:19:10,271 --> 00:19:10,592
Scott: Uh-huh.

320
00:19:11,174 --> 00:19:11,536
Rym: That's all.

321
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:12,259
Scott: All right.

322
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:15,210
Rym: I can tell you don't care at all about world politics.

323
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:26,023
Rym: So anyway things of the day you got a thing of the day.

324
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:26,465
Scott: I do.

325
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:27,168
Scott: so check this out.

326
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:31,246
Scott: this guy This video was on the internet and then it got taken down, but I found it again.

327
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:32,050
Scott: So take that internet.

328
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:38,030
Scott: Basically, this guy pulls a funny prank that I think is actually a dangerous prank that I would not have pulled.

329
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,816
Rym: I'm surprised he did not get shot.

330
00:19:39,957 --> 00:19:46,458
Scott: Yeah, he basically puts was stocking over his head like a like a bird like a Mug, you know like he's gonna rob the store.

331
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:52,130
Scott: and then he just goes legitimately shopping at a bunch of stores freaking out the the store clerk.

332
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:58,542
Rym: My favorite guy is the guy who obviously is ready for this because he runs back locks himself in a cage and just says I call Police you go away.

333
00:19:58,846 --> 00:20:02,879
Scott: Yeah But the thing is is like he did this.

334
00:20:02,939 --> 00:20:06,130
Scott: It looks like he's doing it in the UK, which is much safer.

335
00:20:06,252 --> 00:20:07,389
Rym: Actually, there aren't that many guns.

336
00:20:07,538 --> 00:20:19,242
Scott: Yeah but I mean I think the only country that I would will be willing to risk such a prank is Japan because it had the nation where there's apparently zero Danger of doing even deadly pranks on average unsuspecting.

337
00:20:19,482 --> 00:20:21,910
Scott: Yeah, you can just you know open up porta potties.

338
00:20:22,091 --> 00:20:27,530
Scott: You can send people out of you know, hot tubs careening down mountains the sniper prank.

339
00:20:27,731 --> 00:20:29,302
Scott: Yeah, you can do whatever the hell you want.

340
00:20:29,342 --> 00:20:32,400
Scott: in terms of pranks in Japan It's like if you're a prank you can break.

341
00:20:32,601 --> 00:20:35,635
Scott: if you're pranking you can break no law Especially if you have a camera.

342
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:41,442
Rym: actually one underrated one is the one where they just had a floor in an office building That would just collapse into a pool of water.

343
00:20:41,463 --> 00:20:46,480
Scott: Yeah Yeah, so I mean in Japan it's pretty safe.

344
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,630
Scott: the worst it's like some guy might come at you with a sword.

345
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:49,739
Scott: You just run away first.

346
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:50,949
Rym: Remember this might have been done for TV.

347
00:20:51,271 --> 00:20:57,130
Rym: So there's a there's a not zero chance true that they went in and primed the people like look we're gonna do a prank.

348
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,438
Rym: So just freak out for the cam.

349
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,041
Scott: that is true.

350
00:20:59,061 --> 00:21:00,570
Scott: is that there is a camera in there, right?

351
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,658
Scott: So these people they're running and hiding.

352
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,490
Scott: but and there's you think oh, they're just seeing this robber.

353
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,598
Scott: But actually they're also seeing a guy videotaping.

354
00:21:07,678 --> 00:21:11,432
Rym: the guy might have a hidden camera, but I note the camera is a little too Steady.

355
00:21:11,573 --> 00:21:13,630
Scott: Yeah, there's someone follow a given watching him.

356
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:20,010
Scott: So yeah, I bet they tried this at a bunch of places until they actually found someone who wasn't looking at the camera.

357
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,443
Scott: But you know anyway, it's so funny.

358
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:23,830
Scott: So even though it might be fake

359
00:21:24,131 --> 00:21:41,126
Rym: It's Monday and it's just a college humor, but it's actually a very important message, especially if you Monday listeners I know you like me and like many of us will be ready for bed be tired and Have a computer connected to the internet and you'll sit there drawing squares on your desktop and watching YouTube videos.

360
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:46,110
Rym: You've already seen Long into the night when you could sleep like this.

361
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:51,370
Rym: There's this desire for entertainment that is stronger than the desire to have a good night's sleep.

362
00:21:52,075 --> 00:21:53,063
Rym: This video is for you.

363
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,399
Rym: it is actually Surprisingly apt.

364
00:21:55,945 --> 00:21:58,075
Scott: it is Scarily accurate.

365
00:21:58,135 --> 00:22:02,550
Rym: is that part where he's like you're just sitting there drawing squares on your desktop and I'm like, I've done that.

366
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:04,342
Rym: I've done that many nights.

367
00:22:04,362 --> 00:22:12,039
Scott: I Usually don't have you know, I don't have much problem falling asleep because I you know, I don't have trouble falling asleep But I will delay sleep.

368
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:23,160
Scott: I know good reason I don't really delay sleep but I'll you know because I can always if I go reach for a DS or for a book or for a comic book and I just go at it and don't you know?

369
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,350
Scott: switch to anything else and I just keep going at it.

370
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,297
Scott: Eventually, I will just be sleep.

371
00:22:27,317 --> 00:22:28,502
Rym: There's some Final Fantasy.

372
00:22:28,522 --> 00:22:29,024
Rym: That'll get you.

373
00:22:29,406 --> 00:22:29,646
Scott: Oh good.

374
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:33,373
Scott: Hey Works every time.

375
00:22:33,434 --> 00:22:36,605
Scott: Dragon Quest 9 was doing that pretty well until my DS got stolen.

376
00:22:36,645 --> 00:22:39,698
Scott: So then I lost the save game So I not playing that game again.

377
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,729
Rym: Actually, I don't do it as much as I used to RIT.

378
00:22:41,932 --> 00:22:42,850
Rym: I was really bad about that.

379
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,938
Rym: Sometimes I just sit there at night watching AMVs.

380
00:22:45,018 --> 00:22:46,424
Rym: if I had class at like 8 a.m.

381
00:22:46,444 --> 00:22:46,926
Rym: The next day.

382
00:22:46,946 --> 00:22:47,970
Scott: I didn't do that.

383
00:22:48,172 --> 00:22:49,210
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

384
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:55,123
Rym: So metamoment metamoment we're gonna be at MAGFest.

385
00:22:55,323 --> 00:22:56,487
Scott: Oh shit this real soon, isn't it?

386
00:22:56,507 --> 00:22:57,470
Rym: Yeah, that's real soon.

387
00:22:57,731 --> 00:22:58,918
Rym: Oh crap, we're doing.

388
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:00,810
Rym: losing should be fun and a bunch of other panels.

389
00:23:01,372 --> 00:23:03,601
Rym: It's an updated version of losing should be fun.

390
00:23:03,661 --> 00:23:04,906
Scott: They needed an updated version.

391
00:23:04,986 --> 00:23:06,010
Rym: It didn't need an updated version.

392
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,990
Scott: We've learned a lot since then so I don't get it's like we did that other panel at PAX, right?

393
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:13,130
Scott: We did two panels there basically right not counting the crap late show.

394
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:16,643
Scott: Which yeah guys game mechanics mechanism is done and losing should be fun.

395
00:23:16,663 --> 00:23:18,470
Rym: and give me guys losing should be fun.

396
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:21,600
Rym: We did a graciously unrealized potential.

397
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,005
Rym: All right, we did on Sunday.

398
00:23:23,025 --> 00:23:24,510
Rym: I was tired as balls, right?

399
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,399
Scott: But it's like clearly right.

400
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:28,663
Scott: the game mechanism design.

401
00:23:28,683 --> 00:23:30,290
Rym: That's like our best panels like the best.

402
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:33,483
Scott: So why are the people not asking us to do the best one?

403
00:23:33,503 --> 00:23:34,427
Rym: Yeah, I should forward you.

404
00:23:34,467 --> 00:23:35,230
Rym: Did you tell them?

405
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,470
Scott: Hey, this is our best one.

406
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,414
Rym: I should forward you.

407
00:23:37,454 --> 00:23:46,790
Rym: the conversations I have with all conventions because usually it's along the lines of Here are like the three panels that we want to do and this one is fucking awesome.

408
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:51,528
Rym: And I get an email back like I heard you guys did something called beyond Dungeons & Dragons.

409
00:23:51,548 --> 00:23:52,190
Rym: That was really good.

410
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:52,928
Rym: Could you run that?

411
00:23:54,071 --> 00:23:54,757
Scott: I'd be like look.

412
00:23:54,777 --> 00:23:55,080
Rym: I was like.

413
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,212
Rym: usually I'm like no I'd be like.

414
00:23:57,534 --> 00:24:00,246
Scott: you should just tell only offer the ones that are the best ones.

415
00:24:00,287 --> 00:24:00,990
Scott: don't offer the other ones.

416
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,870
Scott: Just be like look we've got a new panel game.

417
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,677
Scott: I can get game mechanics mechanism design.

418
00:24:04,697 --> 00:24:07,730
Rym: you wants to do it thing is at least it's not like it's packs.

419
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,802
Rym: We're gonna do the same panel again, and I don't want to do the same time.

420
00:24:10,902 --> 00:24:12,649
Scott: if it's West East, you know.

421
00:24:13,191 --> 00:24:17,085
Rym: But even that it we did beyond the India two PAX West's, all right, it's a new.

422
00:24:17,145 --> 00:24:18,590
Rym: it's a panel for an audience.

423
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:22,347
Rym: We've never done and I think actually it was a really good panel and we didn't run.

424
00:24:22,388 --> 00:24:24,079
Scott: not bad But it's not the best.

425
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:25,490
Scott: so we want to go out with the best.

426
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,283
Rym: Well, we didn't run it as many times as we should have and could have.

427
00:24:28,424 --> 00:24:29,630
Scott: Anyway, it's met a moment here.

428
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,513
Scott: Let's let's see.

429
00:24:30,653 --> 00:24:31,857
Rym: So magfest will be there.

430
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:33,141
Rym: We'll be chilling with John St.

431
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:35,187
Rym: John and James Rolfe and all the cool people.

432
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:38,355
Scott: Yep, and I know it's holidays.

433
00:24:38,575 --> 00:24:41,264
Rym: So the book club book is Michio Kaku's hyperspace.

434
00:24:41,284 --> 00:24:42,388
Scott: All right.

435
00:24:42,408 --> 00:24:43,150
Scott: Are you reading it Scott?

436
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,414
Scott: No, that's gonna be for a while.

437
00:24:44,575 --> 00:24:44,836
Scott: Really?

438
00:24:44,896 --> 00:24:46,302
Rym: It's it's a quick book to read.

439
00:24:46,322 --> 00:24:47,948
Scott: I don't even have a copy.

440
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:49,624
Rym: really You need a copy.

441
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:55,980
Rym: I got a couple Next year also coming up in the near future.

442
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:59,690
Rym: you can google the details but no pants day is coming.

443
00:25:00,071 --> 00:25:00,394
Scott: Oh, right.

444
00:25:00,434 --> 00:25:01,622
Scott: January is in the winner.

445
00:25:01,903 --> 00:25:02,910
Rym: It's early in January.

446
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:08,892
Rym: We'll be there doing our no pants thing and I recommend if you live in a city that is doing it Do it.

447
00:25:09,453 --> 00:25:13,967
Rym: if you live in a city that is not doing it go to the website and volunteer to do it.

448
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:19,042
Rym: Yep Anyway doesn't quite have the same impact on cities without mass transit though.

449
00:25:19,242 --> 00:25:20,346
Scott: No, what are you doing?

450
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:21,410
Scott: a city with no mass transit?

451
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:33,567
Rym: Uh walk to work in your boxers or just go to work in your boxers, but you just you're driving in a car Yeah, and then you get out in the parking lot and walk go to Walmart I guess and they'll just kick your ass out.

452
00:25:34,931 --> 00:25:35,955
Rym: What rule you're breaking?

453
00:25:36,096 --> 00:25:39,510
Scott: I have pants on pants on you out of the store for any reason.

454
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,248
Rym: Yeah, if they got it, what are they gonna say except for being black?

455
00:25:42,268 --> 00:25:50,424
Scott: They can't Being a Jew right, but they can kick you out of the store for not having pants.

456
00:25:50,645 --> 00:25:51,629
Scott: that's perfectly legal.

457
00:25:53,072 --> 00:25:56,757
Rym: Well, you make a scene and you film it All right, so it's the end of the year.

458
00:25:56,777 --> 00:26:01,610
Scott: There's really when it comes to the end of the decade It's true.

459
00:26:02,832 --> 00:26:03,639
Scott: So it's millennia.

460
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:04,002
Scott: Just kidding.

461
00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:09,430
Scott: Uh So there's really not really much news ever except there's tons of news.

462
00:26:10,912 --> 00:26:11,618
Rym: There's like ten.

463
00:26:11,658 --> 00:26:14,884
Rym: tech news is That I could have talked about like right now.

464
00:26:14,984 --> 00:26:15,750
Rym: I had trouble picking.

465
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,055
Rym: I did the succinate things.

466
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,426
Rym: there was something I could just kind of mention as a blurb.

467
00:26:19,486 --> 00:26:20,370
Rym: I didn't want to go long.

468
00:26:20,651 --> 00:26:21,495
Scott: Well, the thing is right.

469
00:26:21,535 --> 00:26:29,708
Scott: We don't want to do a news show anyway, right and at the same time We're sort of running out of tech, you know non news topics.

470
00:26:29,848 --> 00:26:31,479
Rym: I'm not Okay.

471
00:26:32,911 --> 00:26:34,120
Scott: How come you couldn't come up with any.

472
00:26:34,442 --> 00:26:35,247
Rym: I came up with like ten.

473
00:26:35,267 --> 00:26:37,480
Scott: you just didn't Grab people and you know it.

474
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:38,746
Scott: I think they were good.

475
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:39,410
Scott: No, whatever.

476
00:26:40,251 --> 00:26:41,759
Rym: So I want to talk about link rot.

477
00:26:42,342 --> 00:26:43,065
Scott: That is a good idea.

478
00:26:43,085 --> 00:26:43,930
Scott: We should put that on the list.

479
00:26:44,492 --> 00:26:46,058
Rym: It's been on the list for like a month.

480
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:47,463
Scott: You didn't mention it earlier.

481
00:26:47,704 --> 00:26:49,150
Scott: I was saying hey, what should we do the show on?

482
00:26:49,430 --> 00:27:02,728
Scott: Anyway, yeah, so I came up with a good idea earlier, which is hey, let's start a thing where every year We will talk about the biggest stuff that happened in the past year, I know this is a cliche.

483
00:27:02,768 --> 00:27:04,029
Scott: everyone does this But you know what?

484
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:10,255
Scott: I think we're gonna do it better than everyone else because we're smarter than everyone else and we will also predict for the next year.

485
00:27:10,355 --> 00:27:18,553
Scott: and then it'll be even more interesting next year because you can look back at the previous predictions and see if we are geniuses or morons and That will be the.

486
00:27:18,774 --> 00:27:25,550
Scott: so this show might not be the greatest but it'll be awesome next year when we do the second show And forever there, you know, so we're laying some groundwork.

487
00:27:25,691 --> 00:27:26,475
Rym: I feel like I don't.

488
00:27:26,576 --> 00:27:45,122
Rym: I originally I wanted to talk a lot about the previous Year, and then I realized just now because it's the end of the decade, you know decades ago at least in America They're kind of seen as like the boundaries of things like the 90s was the age of the Internet and then the 2000s were this Kind of whole different world and now we're in the 2010s and everything's way different again.

489
00:27:45,142 --> 00:27:53,610
Rym: Yep, but at the same time I don't know if I want to go back and talk about all you know What happened in the last decade because every tech site in the world is gonna do that.

490
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,610
Rym: I kind of really just want I mean you want to talk about the last decade here.

491
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,596
Scott: I'll take you through it ready.

492
00:27:57,938 --> 00:27:58,923
Rym: Look at the last a year.

493
00:27:59,064 --> 00:28:03,902
Scott: in the year 2000 They were worried about right y2k and it was a legitimate worry.

494
00:28:03,942 --> 00:28:08,340
Rym: you assholes us tech guys fixed it for you and Napster was still rocking.

495
00:28:08,964 --> 00:28:12,337
Scott: and then in 2010 Facebook in Farmville, there you go.

496
00:28:12,517 --> 00:28:14,004
Scott: That's that's the little decade.

497
00:28:14,044 --> 00:28:14,968
Scott: That's how far we've come.

498
00:28:16,431 --> 00:28:18,940
Rym: The stock market in 2000 pretty good.

499
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,842
Rym: That's right.

500
00:28:20,244 --> 00:28:20,444
Rym: There were.

501
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:23,412
Rym: there were no tablets back then Smartphones.

502
00:28:23,473 --> 00:28:26,424
Rym: people didn't have smartphones hell in 2000.

503
00:28:26,424 --> 00:28:27,870
Rym: I didn't have a cell phone.

504
00:28:28,771 --> 00:28:29,454
Scott: Nope, not me.

505
00:28:29,936 --> 00:28:31,422
Scott: I mean they my family had them.

506
00:28:31,462 --> 00:28:31,803
Scott: I didn't have.

507
00:28:31,823 --> 00:28:35,337
Rym: yeah, I had one in like 1998 But that was the family's like brick phone.

508
00:28:35,357 --> 00:28:38,950
Scott: Anyway, let's talk about 2010 in no particular order, right?

509
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:43,805
Scott: The biggest I guess tech thing that any tech site is gonna report on is the iPad.

510
00:28:43,825 --> 00:28:50,210
Scott: just because they always Talk about Apple more than anyone else because well Apple gets you know, the lot most attention.

511
00:28:50,511 --> 00:29:02,388
Rym: Apple very brilliantly created a third like a third and viable market for tablets because the market of Doctors and workers never really panned out and the market of artists never really panned out.

512
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:22,543
Scott: Yeah Well, you know, I think they definitely you know, pretty much anything Apple makes people buy I think Alma, you know, I mean even the new Apple TV, which I think is pretty terrible, you know It's just really small which makes it it's better than the previous Apple TV, but it's still not good especially if you compare it to the Mac Mini, but Apparently they sold a million of those.

513
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:24,648
Scott: So You know, what do I know?

514
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:35,150
Scott: The only thing that disappoints me about the iPad still is that while you know It is saw it is made the idea of a tablet device useful to apparently many people.

515
00:29:35,672 --> 00:29:39,410
Scott: It is still not a tablet device for the artists, which is what is needed.

516
00:29:40,232 --> 00:29:42,950
Rym: Yes, but you know, we've talked about this so we won't talk about it further.

517
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,874
Rym: But that's all I have to say.

518
00:29:43,894 --> 00:29:46,566
Rym: it's an ish market that might not be served in the next year.

519
00:29:46,586 --> 00:29:58,447
Scott: No WikiLeaks was gigantic in 2010. surprisingly recent - yeah I mean I was given money to WikiLeaks like a long time ago But it took this long people to actually lose their shit about it.

520
00:30:00,034 --> 00:30:02,070
Scott: The Kinect came out just recently.

521
00:30:02,251 --> 00:30:07,770
Scott: I'm still not exactly how sure how well that's gonna pan out in terms of will this be popular?

522
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:11,294
Rym: You know, let's just start throwing right into predictions Next year.

523
00:30:11,314 --> 00:30:14,390
Rym: I don't think the Kinect is going to be a major player.

524
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:16,661
Scott: I think the Kinect is basically like the Wiimote.

525
00:30:16,721 --> 00:30:16,962
Scott: right.

526
00:30:17,204 --> 00:30:23,510
Scott: and the thing is, you know The Wiimote had plenty of you know hacks to people like oh look what I was able to do with the Wiimote.

527
00:30:23,772 --> 00:30:25,483
Rym: You can do the same thing with a webcam.

528
00:30:25,503 --> 00:30:26,228
Rym: Just give it time.

529
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:34,604
Scott: Yeah well, no, there are things that Kinect can do kind of webcam can't do now, but The Kinect is you know, it's people are hacking it.

530
00:30:34,705 --> 00:30:38,741
Scott: They're having fun with it You know, but you know some people are having fun with the games.

531
00:30:38,842 --> 00:30:40,006
Scott: but but industry was.

532
00:30:40,027 --> 00:30:40,890
Rym: we know what's gonna happen.

533
00:30:41,254 --> 00:30:42,870
Scott: It's gonna be the same as the Wiimote.

534
00:30:43,771 --> 00:30:46,366
Rym: They're going to be a whole bunch of games that use it in a gimmicky fashion.

535
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,472
Rym: a few games We'll use it.

536
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:52,535
Rym: Well, and then they'll just be a component in a lot of games Basically not know worthy.

537
00:30:52,555 --> 00:30:55,104
Scott: I actually read this interesting thing is a story.

538
00:30:55,285 --> 00:30:56,730
Scott: It's just anecdotal story.

539
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:01,730
Scott: So whatever it's not evidence of anything, but some family like, you know an old lady and her husband, right?

540
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:09,996
Scott: They bought the the Wii and the Wii fit and whatever right and they were like, yay So they went back to the store Right, and they were like, oh let's get some more.

541
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:15,758
Scott: we say look around and there was nothing for them because there's only one We fit and that's it.

542
00:31:16,706 --> 00:31:19,480
Scott: And it's Yeah, but I mean it's like it comes with Wii Sports.

543
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:21,830
Scott: So it's like you turn around from the other side.

544
00:31:21,851 --> 00:31:29,545
Scott: It's like okay I go to the store and I buy a Wii and I get Mario and then I go back to the store and I've bought the four Mario games.

545
00:31:29,585 --> 00:31:31,853
Scott: then I go back to the store and There's nothing.

546
00:31:31,913 --> 00:31:36,349
Rym: well, one of the best multiplayer games on the Wii to this day is the GameCube version of Wario.

547
00:31:36,389 --> 00:31:36,590
Scott: where?

548
00:31:37,431 --> 00:31:40,302
Scott: Right, so I think the Wii is is it's you know.

549
00:31:40,382 --> 00:31:44,297
Scott: at this point, you know, some people like oh It doesn't everything for the hardcore gamer.

550
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:48,050
Scott: and but the you know, you think I was just for the casual nobody gamer.

551
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:52,084
Scott: But really those people go to the Wii and they say oh, there's nothing for me here either.

552
00:31:52,385 --> 00:31:55,056
Scott: It's all this in-between Stuff it's stuff.

553
00:31:55,077 --> 00:31:58,479
Scott: That's too, you know, non hardcore People don't want it.

554
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:12,490
Scott: But I mean a person who buys Wii fit to do some jumping up and down is not even gonna buy You know the most casual shovelware, so the Wii won in the sense that it made a new market for gamers.

555
00:32:13,371 --> 00:32:19,230
Rym: It made gamers who previously weren't gamers in that in that market segment and then sold a product to all of them.

556
00:32:19,655 --> 00:32:26,330
Scott: Yeah, it made a lot of money But I think the Farmville is is ten times in the same department as the Wii maybe a hundred times.

557
00:32:26,691 --> 00:32:29,001
Rym: Yeah, I would argue the Farmville isn't a game but that we did.

558
00:32:29,101 --> 00:32:29,583
Rym: I digress.

559
00:32:30,005 --> 00:32:33,035
Scott: It doesn't matter if it's not a game All together.

560
00:32:33,116 --> 00:32:34,941
Rym: yeah, in fact, it's a different industry.

561
00:32:35,142 --> 00:32:37,770
Scott: the people who bought a weed to do we fit and that's it.

562
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,369
Scott: Are the same people who play in Farmville?

563
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:46,718
Rym: Technologically though notice how the ps3 was supposed to be the ten-year console and it kind of is gonna be the ten-year console But it really doesn't have any.

564
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:48,184
Scott: ps3 is doing the same thing.

565
00:32:48,204 --> 00:32:48,987
Scott: The PSP did.

566
00:32:49,027 --> 00:32:49,850
Scott: it's sticking around.

567
00:32:50,131 --> 00:32:53,126
Scott: There's still a bunch of people who doesn't have anything on the Xbox.

568
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:58,182
Rym: the extra power It has is not being utilized and by the time there's something that will utilize it.

569
00:32:58,523 --> 00:32:59,085
Rym: It won't matter.

570
00:32:59,105 --> 00:33:05,286
Rym: No anyway, so Processors those didn't get used in a million things.

571
00:33:05,326 --> 00:33:06,010
Rym: Did they know?

572
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:14,237
Scott: Netflix definitely busted out in 2010. at the beginning of the year you could do Netflix on like almost you know What your Roku maybe?

573
00:33:14,338 --> 00:33:20,265
Rym: Yeah, I bought a Roku even exist And did I come into existence in 2010 or it might have been before then.

574
00:33:20,285 --> 00:33:21,450
Rym: we had the Roku for a while.

575
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,177
Rym: Yeah, I did it in beacon.

576
00:33:23,397 --> 00:33:25,465
Scott: Yeah, but was it before last new year?

577
00:33:25,987 --> 00:33:26,570
Rym: I think so.

578
00:33:27,152 --> 00:33:29,599
Scott: But anyway, you couldn't really get Netflix on.

579
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,626
Scott: you know streaming on many devices also.

580
00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:37,850
Scott: the selection was pretty small But by the end of 2010 you could stream Netflix on every motherfucker that had a screen.

581
00:33:38,454 --> 00:33:40,450
Scott: So Netflix definitely busted out big time.

582
00:33:41,851 --> 00:33:43,556
Scott: Net neutrality in 2010.

583
00:33:43,556 --> 00:33:45,782
Scott: We don't have it getting some setbacks.

584
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:46,685
Scott: They passed.

585
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:50,356
Scott: the FCC said something This is only recent useless.

586
00:33:50,898 --> 00:33:51,962
Scott: It's it's not good.

587
00:33:51,982 --> 00:33:53,306
Rym: I'm not I'm worried.

588
00:33:53,547 --> 00:33:54,370
Rym: I'm actually worried.

589
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:59,070
Scott: Android in 2010 actually succeeded beyond what I expected.

590
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:00,435
Rym: Well, this is the problem.

591
00:34:00,816 --> 00:34:04,810
Rym: Android sucks, but it it's the only thing exactly.

592
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:14,458
Scott: Um, I predict that in 2011 what you're gonna see is the iPhone will despite, you know This rumors been going on forever iPhones gonna be on something's not AT&T.

593
00:34:14,478 --> 00:34:15,362
Scott: Oh, it's gonna be us.

594
00:34:15,402 --> 00:34:16,949
Rym: I don't think we're gonna see it in the next year.

595
00:34:17,251 --> 00:34:17,873
Scott: I think we are.

596
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:20,909
Scott: I think this is the year it's actually gonna be true.

597
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:25,106
Scott: You are gonna see the iPhone on Verizon for reals this time.

598
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:37,783
Scott: This is the real time Because with the 4g and the LTE and all that stuff right LTE is actually going to be big in 2011. going into 2012 is when you're gonna see LTE actually started to become.

599
00:34:37,884 --> 00:34:38,609
Rym: you know, well, here we go.

600
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:49,686
Rym: This is the first proper prediction because a lot of tech news people make softball predictions Like if I wanted to say Android is gonna be 75% of the smartphone market.

601
00:34:49,706 --> 00:34:51,753
Rym: That's a stupid prediction It's obvious.

602
00:34:51,973 --> 00:34:54,300
Scott: I think what's gonna happen is LTE is gonna get big.

603
00:34:54,521 --> 00:34:58,712
Scott: The iPhone is gonna finally come out on non AT&T.

604
00:34:59,153 --> 00:35:16,247
Scott: all those people on that carrier probably Verizon are going to as their contracts run out or maybe even earlier than that are gonna Bail to get iPhones and Verizon AT&T people with iPhones are gonna bail to go to Verizon to get iPhones and It's gonna take about a two years because that's what how.

605
00:35:16,307 --> 00:35:20,390
Scott: it'll long It'll take for the iPhone contracts to expire and such and you know what?

606
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,238
Scott: I think I you know and I think you're gonna see.

607
00:35:22,338 --> 00:35:27,059
Scott: Android is gonna take a big hit as people are able to stay with The carrier they like and get get an iPhone.

608
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:31,373
Rym: Ah, see I don't think Android is gonna take a big Not big hit.

609
00:35:31,714 --> 00:35:33,620
Rym: So here's here's why I disagree one.

610
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,250
Rym: I don't think the iPhone is going to be on Verizon in 2011.

611
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,494
Scott: I think it will definitely be.

612
00:35:38,515 --> 00:35:40,040
Scott: this is the real.

613
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:40,742
Rym: here's the question.

614
00:35:41,063 --> 00:35:42,468
Rym: what it all comes down to is why?

615
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,357
Rym: Specifically what is the exact reason?

616
00:35:46,698 --> 00:35:51,370
Rym: it's on AT&T only who paid whom how much and are they going to continue to pay?

617
00:35:51,790 --> 00:36:02,325
Scott: it's because AT&T pay gives Apple a huge deal right and Because AT&T were the only people who would let Apple run the show right.

618
00:36:02,365 --> 00:36:03,830
Scott: Verizon wanted to be like.

619
00:36:03,853 --> 00:36:08,187
Scott: Oh we got to put a Verizon logo on it and we're gonna gotta pull up rise and apps on there.

620
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:08,930
Scott: and Apple was like.

621
00:36:09,512 --> 00:36:13,567
Scott: And now that the iPhone succeeded on AT&T Verizon has learned the error of their ways.

622
00:36:13,628 --> 00:36:14,170
Scott: they like shit.

623
00:36:14,813 --> 00:36:17,709
Scott: we have to let Apple on and we have to let them have it their way.

624
00:36:17,729 --> 00:36:25,489
Scott: and You know fine and you're they have you know, they're finally gonna cave in and give Apple the you know The money they want they do.

625
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:32,783
Rym: Verizon doesn't need the iPhone because if they stay if the iPhone stays at AT&T because it's not gonna go to Sprint or anything They might know.

626
00:36:32,844 --> 00:36:39,850
Rym: it's a space You know probably not like right the company that goes out of its way to have the shittiest phones of every generation of phones.

627
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,500
Scott: They're not doing too bad lately.

628
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:44,029
Rym: Oh, they're doing fine because they're cheap.

629
00:36:44,532 --> 00:36:52,690
Rym: They're cheap and they have great coverage Verizon is expensive and as great coverage the mobile is actually coming up from behind because they're putting the LTE up before everyone else.

630
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:55,644
Rym: Yeah, but I don't trust t-mobile because I occasionally leave the city.

631
00:36:55,664 --> 00:37:01,707
Scott: Yeah Listen, you know t-mobile does have less coverage than all the others, but it's not bad.

632
00:37:02,128 --> 00:37:07,029
Rym: It works You know, it's the thing is if I'm going t-mobile, I'm going like Metro PCS.

633
00:37:07,611 --> 00:37:13,769
Scott: Well, I mean the thing is I would go Metro PCS if you can get a good phone and they actually do have a smartphone Now, but it's really terrible.

634
00:37:14,471 --> 00:37:15,816
Scott: It's like the shittiest smartphone you can get.

635
00:37:15,857 --> 00:37:28,730
Rym: but basically if say the word the iPhone stays on AT&T and they don't make a deal with Verizon and they don't go to Sprint The only people that Verizon loses are the people who really really want the iPhone, which is a lot of people.

636
00:37:29,155 --> 00:37:30,269
Rym: But they're not the majority.

637
00:37:30,612 --> 00:37:33,389
Rym: They're like, I think a quarter of the expanded market.

638
00:37:34,451 --> 00:37:41,849
Rym: So AT&T but Verizon then will always get the people who have the belief either mistaken or not that Verizon is reliable and fast and better.

639
00:37:42,452 --> 00:37:43,675
Scott: you're thinking about it the wrong way right?

640
00:37:43,696 --> 00:37:52,442
Scott: Verizon basically didn't lose anybody except for the people who really really wanted the iPhone and Pretty much you look around and all these people who are on Verizon.

641
00:37:52,482 --> 00:37:53,605
Scott: They will never leave Verizon.

642
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,370
Scott: They're loyal to Verizon first, right?

643
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:57,118
Scott: They must have a rise and they have no choice.

644
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:57,842
Scott: It's like that.

645
00:37:58,103 --> 00:37:59,430
Scott: You know, all they choose is their phone.

646
00:38:00,514 --> 00:38:04,330
Rym: Think that those people actually flip-flop between Sprint and Verizon.

647
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,554
Scott: I don't know that everyone.

648
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:10,470
Rym: I've seen polls where people basically believe that both of them have equal coverage.

649
00:38:10,737 --> 00:38:18,130
Rym: the only Carrier that I see having significant negative press is AT&T even though the negative press is actually less warranted recently.

650
00:38:18,371 --> 00:38:21,259
Scott: Yeah, AT&T has improved its network at least in New York City.

651
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,930
Scott: But anyway, there are people who absolutely must stick with Verizon.

652
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:27,019
Scott: They will not leave it no matter what right.

653
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,914
Scott: and these people they want an iPhone but they will not leave.

654
00:38:31,234 --> 00:38:34,525
Scott: so they get an Android phone because that's the smartphone that Verizon has.

655
00:38:34,665 --> 00:38:36,873
Scott: see IV iPhone comes out on Verizon.

656
00:38:37,095 --> 00:38:39,810
Scott: they they will go and get that iPhone immediately.

657
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:42,158
Scott: They are dying for it, but they will not leave to go get.

658
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:42,419
Scott: I don't

659
00:38:42,439 --> 00:39:03,704
Rym: think they are as many people as the much more Viable cash cow which is the currently non Smartphone to people who want a smartphone or would like a smartphone or don't even know they want a smartphone But the commodity Android, you know $50 phone that they get from Verizon or even Sprint is a smartphone.

660
00:39:03,985 --> 00:39:05,650
Rym: but oh they need a data plan now.

661
00:39:06,232 --> 00:39:12,696
Rym: And the data plan being sold to the person who never had a smartphone before is worth way more money Than the guy who wants the I.

662
00:39:12,716 --> 00:39:23,501
Scott: you're also not thinking about right the fact that if the iPhone came out on Verizon There are so many dissatisfied AT&T iPhone users they will all bail immediately.

663
00:39:23,521 --> 00:39:24,083
Scott: No, they won't.

664
00:39:24,123 --> 00:39:25,647
Rym: they will bail the contract ends.

665
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:30,370
Rym: name you way Overestimate how much people actually will break a contract.

666
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:38,110
Scott: No These people are dying to get the hell away from AT&T and if the iPhone is the only they're more loyal to the iPhone than they are to the carrier.

667
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:43,210
Scott: So as soon as that iPhone as soon as they have a choice of carrier, they will choose anything by one.

668
00:39:43,451 --> 00:39:48,742
Rym: I disagree but to suppose that's true AT&T is gonna keep a death grip on that.

669
00:39:48,782 --> 00:39:50,069
Rym: They'll pay whatever they need to pay.

670
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:52,194
Scott: No, also Verizon.

671
00:39:52,215 --> 00:39:53,839
Rym: I don't think I mean.

672
00:39:54,381 --> 00:40:04,490
Rym: if it's a matter of AT&T paying to keep it exclusive AT&T will pay and the only reason they lose it is if Apple says look you've got to pay us, you know infinity dollars.

673
00:40:05,252 --> 00:40:10,250
Scott: Yeah, that's the thing is that they won't do that because Verizon probably is taking the opposite tack.

674
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:19,023
Rym: They're saying if we get the iPhone Apple you have to do X Y and Z for us and Apple's gonna say no They've already learned that they have to cave to Apple.

675
00:40:19,245 --> 00:40:20,030
Scott: They've learned this lesson.

676
00:40:20,554 --> 00:40:22,670
Rym: I don't think they've learned that lesson because I don't think it's true.

677
00:40:22,911 --> 00:40:23,574
Scott: No, you're gonna.

678
00:40:23,614 --> 00:40:25,603
Scott: you're gonna be wrong and we will see in a year from now.

679
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:25,965
Rym: Let's see.

680
00:40:26,045 --> 00:40:30,463
Scott: It is on record The iPhones gonna come out in Verizon.

681
00:40:30,504 --> 00:40:34,397
Scott: people are gonna bail From AT&T as soon as they can.

682
00:40:34,597 --> 00:40:35,400
Rym: that's your prediction.

683
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,924
Rym: My prediction is no.

684
00:40:37,205 --> 00:40:38,950
Scott: Android is gonna take a hit as a result.

685
00:40:39,131 --> 00:40:45,148
Rym: I think we're gonna see no iPhone on the on Verizon in the next year 2011 and two.

686
00:40:45,752 --> 00:40:57,290
Rym: I don't think there will be any sort of hit to Android because for every one person The people are buying iPhones are gonna be dwarfed by the non smartphone people who buy a commodity Android smartphone.

687
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:59,944
Scott: No, cuz they're gonna buy right when the eye is.

688
00:41:00,226 --> 00:41:01,050
Scott: this isn't even a prediction.

689
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,037
Scott: We know it's gonna happen right.

690
00:41:02,077 --> 00:41:03,830
Scott: the iPhone four and a half is gonna come out.

691
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:04,936
Rym: It's gonna be an incremental improvement.

692
00:41:04,976 --> 00:41:06,464
Scott: It's gonna be like the iPhone 3DS.

693
00:41:06,605 --> 00:41:14,188
Scott: I think what's gonna happen Though obviously is the same thing that's happened before right is that iPhone 4.5 is gonna come out.

694
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,817
Scott: Right, that's gonna be on Verizon.

695
00:41:17,857 --> 00:41:26,587
Scott: the people are gonna switch to it and the iPhone 4 gets the price dropped Just like the I. you can get a 3G now or 3GS for way cheap, right?

696
00:41:26,607 --> 00:41:27,390
Scott: They make it way cheap.

697
00:41:27,671 --> 00:41:31,310
Scott: So the commodity smartphone is gonna be the old iPhone.

698
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:34,270
Scott: It's not gonna be so not going to happen.

699
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:40,267
Rym: The commodity smartphone is gonna be like some HTC piece of crap that they get for like 50 bucks.

700
00:41:40,307 --> 00:41:44,912
Rym: with their two-year plan You could get the old iPhone for $99.

701
00:41:44,912 --> 00:41:50,367
Rym: If you look at the way plans are right now Sprint especially and Verizon to a lesser degree.

702
00:41:50,748 --> 00:41:54,017
Rym: They're really Pushing the two-year contract.

703
00:41:54,217 --> 00:41:56,103
Scott: everyone everyone just gets to your contract.

704
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:56,464
Scott: Yes.

705
00:41:56,685 --> 00:41:58,330
Rym: So how many people have to your contract?

706
00:41:58,651 --> 00:42:01,142
Scott: I highly doubt everyone with an iPhone 3GS.

707
00:42:01,182 --> 00:42:03,130
Scott: their contract runs out in the summer.

708
00:42:03,451 --> 00:42:05,759
Scott: It's always the summer cuz that's when the new iPhone comes out.

709
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:09,058
Scott: So, you know in 2012 the iPhone 4 contract Yeah.

710
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:19,364
Rym: So there's gonna be one more cycle of it being AT&T exclusive and I think 2012 is the year of the iPhone on another 2011 2012 anyway anyway, so let's get away from the phones for a minute.

711
00:42:19,584 --> 00:42:20,848
Rym: So talk about Yahoo.

712
00:42:21,149 --> 00:42:25,379
Rym: Yeah I With the delicious thing and the leaked documents and everything.

713
00:42:25,399 --> 00:42:29,313
Rym: Yahoo is basically, you know, oh my wah mo shindeiru They're all they're dead.

714
00:42:29,393 --> 00:42:32,323
Rym: The company is dead, but the corpse is still moving.

715
00:42:32,644 --> 00:42:34,250
Rym: It doesn't realize it's dead or me?

716
00:42:34,551 --> 00:42:39,870
Rym: Oh, I think more importantly it realizes it's dead and it's trying to pretend that it doesn't know it's dead.

717
00:42:40,231 --> 00:42:46,710
Rym: So it doesn't lose value as they divest themselves of profitable enterprises and then eventually disappear.

718
00:42:47,474 --> 00:42:49,870
Scott: Well, you know to get there is a possibility.

719
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:57,616
Rym: That's definitely what's going on because Yahoo has like, you know a handful of good products that are profitable I assume or at least could be profitable.

720
00:42:57,636 --> 00:42:59,823
Scott: their content business is actually their best stuff.

721
00:42:59,923 --> 00:43:00,104
Scott: right?

722
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:08,290
Scott: Yahoo Finance Yahoo News Crap compared to Google the Yahoo the Yahoo like celebrity news is like one of the most popular sites on the entire Internet.

723
00:43:08,832 --> 00:43:09,254
Scott: It's huge.

724
00:43:09,635 --> 00:43:22,930
Rym: So I think my prediction for the next year is that Yahoo is going to sell off Small numbers like two maybe three of their things that are big that don't have Yahoo brand name.

725
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,816
Scott: No I think I think it's gonna be the opposite.

726
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:33,147
Scott: Yahoo is gonna sell off everything that doesn't make money and they're gonna keep only the Really big parts that are like the core of Yahoo the Yahoo Mail the Yahoo search.

727
00:43:33,207 --> 00:43:35,639
Rym: See no, you're thinking Too much on money.

728
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,645
Rym: It's all about brand.

729
00:43:36,926 --> 00:43:45,319
Rym: what they're gonna do I think is they're going to sell off anything that is not strongly branded with the Yahoo name To get whatever money they can for it.

730
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:52,150
Rym: things like delicious and flicker they can sell off and Those are worth a lot of money to someone who's actually going to use them.

731
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:53,335
Rym: I mean Facebook.

732
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:56,910
Rym: if they bought flicker, that would be a huge and I think excellent deal for them.

733
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:57,392
Scott: Well, they were.

734
00:43:57,412 --> 00:44:00,644
Scott: just the thing is anyone who buys flicker who already has a photo service.

735
00:44:00,745 --> 00:44:01,989
Scott: It's just gonna try to integrate it.

736
00:44:02,231 --> 00:44:04,370
Rym: Oh, yeah, if I were Facebook, I would buy play.

737
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:09,190
Scott: The thing is Yahoo tried to integrate flicker into the Yahoo photos and they just technologically failed at that.

738
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:13,146
Scott: Yahoo failed at a lot of things for the thing is if you do that though is the problem?

739
00:44:13,186 --> 00:44:16,520
Scott: if you try to integrate it All the flicker users will hate you and bail.

740
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:18,147
Rym: Oh, they're not actually gonna bail.

741
00:44:18,448 --> 00:44:18,810
Scott: They will.

742
00:44:18,991 --> 00:44:23,264
Scott: No, they won't if you turn if you just like say alright flicker is now Facebook photos.

743
00:44:23,565 --> 00:44:25,290
Scott: Just use the photos in Facebook.

744
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:26,414
Rym: No, that's not what they do.

745
00:44:26,514 --> 00:44:29,405
Rym: They'd leave flicker up as its own but they they'd over time.

746
00:44:29,445 --> 00:44:47,323
Rym: keep adding things like alright So all you Facebook users You can just import all your flicker photos with all the metadata and then we'll run the facial recognition And go retro tag everything and then they'll go to the flicker people and say hey Have a Facebook account you want a Facebook account.

747
00:44:47,604 --> 00:44:49,010
Rym: you can keep using flicker just fine.

748
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:54,990
Rym: But if you want to use the awesome Facebook face recognition and tag all your friends roll them all into Facebook.

749
00:44:55,131 --> 00:44:55,592
Rym: But you'll keep.

750
00:44:55,612 --> 00:44:56,857
Rym: your flicker will integrate the two.

751
00:44:56,877 --> 00:44:59,688
Scott: Yeah, there's definitely gonna be some shakiness with all things.

752
00:44:59,728 --> 00:45:02,235
Rym: Yahoo I think they're gonna.

753
00:45:02,597 --> 00:45:06,010
Rym: they're gonna decommission any non Yahoo brand that they can't sell.

754
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:17,930
Rym: They're gonna sell any non Yahoo brand they can sell and then everything that's left is just gonna be stuff That's too like directly intimately tied to the Yahoo brand even if it's not tied to Yahoo technologically.

755
00:45:18,831 --> 00:45:27,540
Rym: The Yahoo company will then be sold in a block and is going to be bought by either Yahoo by Yahoo by either Facebook Straight up or Google straight up.

756
00:45:27,761 --> 00:45:30,170
Rym: Yeah, we'll say that's my prediction for the next three years.

757
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:33,970
Rym: But the next year they're gonna sell off all the non Yahoo branded shit.

758
00:45:34,191 --> 00:45:37,304
Scott: Yahoo's definitely gonna have some collapsing in in the year to come.

759
00:45:37,545 --> 00:45:37,686
Rym: Yeah.

760
00:45:37,706 --> 00:45:38,630
Rym: Yahoo is fucked.

761
00:45:39,337 --> 00:45:40,609
Rym: That's really the long and short of it.

762
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:42,255
Scott: Yeah e-readers were actually.

763
00:45:42,275 --> 00:45:46,449
Scott: you know people have been trying to get the e-readers going for years now with no success.

764
00:45:46,529 --> 00:45:50,205
Scott: until 2010 that you readers actually started making big moves.

765
00:45:50,225 --> 00:45:54,037
Rym: the kid sold Raisley this holiday season.

766
00:45:54,077 --> 00:45:54,358
Scott: Yep.

767
00:45:54,439 --> 00:45:55,965
Scott: So did the nook.

768
00:45:56,206 --> 00:45:59,717
Rym: Yeah all the One even is doing pretty well.

769
00:45:59,797 --> 00:46:00,901
Rym: I saw yeah, not bad.

770
00:46:01,503 --> 00:46:03,370
Scott: So the e-readers are doing really well.

771
00:46:03,531 --> 00:46:20,730
Scott: I think that in 2012, it's pretty much gonna be more the same but I think there is gonna be a level off right because what's gonna happen is people are gonna start to realize that Look, this e-reader is just an e-reader, but you could get you know iPad 2 which is also all these other things.

772
00:46:22,592 --> 00:46:32,133
Scott: Some of the Android readers like some of the Android tablets like they got the new the Samsung whatever the hell it is I forget the name of it Galaxy tab.

773
00:46:32,153 --> 00:46:37,270
Rym: at the same time the people who want e-readers they kind of have this movement of not wanting a tablet.

774
00:46:38,112 --> 00:46:39,957
Rym: They don't want all that bullshit.

775
00:46:39,977 --> 00:46:41,040
Rym: They want to read books.

776
00:46:41,281 --> 00:46:42,805
Rym: They see themselves as more erudite.

777
00:46:43,006 --> 00:46:44,570
Rym: and the display technology?

778
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:48,670
Rym: They actually probably want that low energy awesome display for reading.

779
00:46:49,152 --> 00:46:53,930
Scott: Yeah, but the you know, the LCD is clearly shown, you know, you can make a display.

780
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:58,364
Scott: That's not a stupid e-reader display that actually works properly doesn't work that well.

781
00:46:58,445 --> 00:46:59,909
Scott: It works pretty work surprisingly.

782
00:46:59,969 --> 00:47:02,517
Scott: Well I can read with the iBooks on my iPhone.

783
00:47:02,537 --> 00:47:04,343
Scott: I can read whatever.

784
00:47:04,463 --> 00:47:06,530
Scott: so same thing with an iPad.

785
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:07,709
Scott: It's only got to be better than that.

786
00:47:08,231 --> 00:47:17,740
Rym: See, I don't have any strong predictions though in the market because the neck the revolution is going to be the tablet that has a Quote-unquote e-reader like e-paper display and a real display.

787
00:47:18,261 --> 00:47:20,406
Scott: I don't think I think that's something like that is to.

788
00:47:20,988 --> 00:47:24,541
Scott: just the technological Aspects of it are gonna make it too flaky.

789
00:47:24,581 --> 00:47:26,090
Scott: It's not really gonna work not in the short run.

790
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:27,348
Rym: I'm talking like five ten years.

791
00:47:27,971 --> 00:47:29,555
Scott: You'll just more likely.

792
00:47:29,575 --> 00:47:30,377
Scott: you'll just see what.

793
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:35,810
Scott: a better display period that you know of some sort as opposed to some sort of weird.

794
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:42,734
Rym: Oh, yeah It would be some sort of fusion because the one thing that LCD displays like they're treated like the iPad can't do is the passive Display of.

795
00:47:43,055 --> 00:47:47,933
Rym: it is just colors and then light reflecting off of it is the image Anyway, like a book.

796
00:47:48,515 --> 00:47:49,860
Rym: But anyway, there's not much.

797
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,926
Rym: I mean e-readers for sale rights.

798
00:47:51,947 --> 00:47:52,930
Rym: No one really cares about that.

799
00:47:53,294 --> 00:48:03,400
Rym: I think with streaming in Netflix I have bigger predictions because notice how Netflix did the obvious thing toward the end of the year and they now offer a streaming only plan Which is what I think they've realized this.

800
00:48:03,441 --> 00:48:05,770
Rym: I think the the moment of realization for Netflix.

801
00:48:06,672 --> 00:48:14,050
Rym: remember when they got rid of profiles and Everyone lost their shit including me because I needed those profiles because I had my three DVD cues.

802
00:48:14,252 --> 00:48:22,096
Rym: yep, as Soon as they did that everyone bitched and dropped to one cue because they wanted to keep the streaming and without the cues You know multiple DVDs were worthless.

803
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:22,538
Rym: Mm-hmm.

804
00:48:22,959 --> 00:48:25,649
Rym: And then when they brought the cues back, I don't think anyone went back.

805
00:48:25,871 --> 00:48:27,122
Rym: Yeah, I didn't go back.

806
00:48:27,384 --> 00:48:31,986
Rym: and at that moment They probably had a meeting and realized streaming is the only thing anyone cares about anymore.

807
00:48:32,026 --> 00:48:41,090
Scott: actually read something Recently about how Netflix actually has like this huge turnover like this, you know The sort of problems in the workplace is like the opposite of Zappos, right?

808
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:43,049
Scott: I mean even though they somehow managed to turn out.

809
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:45,238
Scott: You know stuff and you can sort of see that.

810
00:48:45,279 --> 00:48:46,042
Scott: maybe this is true.

811
00:48:46,082 --> 00:48:53,265
Scott: looking at the way that the Netflix Software is different and every single platform that this could this is very likely that they're.

812
00:48:53,325 --> 00:48:54,850
Scott: they're sort of, you know, a little dysfunctional.

813
00:48:55,312 --> 00:49:00,229
Scott: You know, it's not like they turn out the same exact thing with clean updates to every platform all at the same time.

814
00:49:01,512 --> 00:49:04,270
Scott: I think you're gonna see it go like one of two ways, right?

815
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:11,490
Scott: Netflix might actually start to level off because everyone's just streaming and it's already on every device and that's it.

816
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:15,748
Scott: And but they are moving to HTML 5 which is not really gonna change their business.

817
00:49:15,809 --> 00:49:18,598
Scott: really Yeah, but I think you can actually see.

818
00:49:18,638 --> 00:49:25,407
Scott: another thing is if they don't figure out like another move Right, if that's all they have is we stream on every platform.

819
00:49:25,447 --> 00:49:26,010
Scott: end of story.

820
00:49:26,872 --> 00:49:28,590
Scott: You're gonna see them start to decline.

821
00:49:28,891 --> 00:49:32,802
Rym: See, I don't see a decline because there are a steady hold.

822
00:49:32,822 --> 00:49:35,490
Scott: You're not gonna see this continued rapid growth of Netflix.

823
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:36,340
Rym: Oh, no, you're not gonna see.

824
00:49:36,361 --> 00:49:37,110
Scott: they need a second.

825
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:38,297
Scott: You know, it's a third act.

826
00:49:38,357 --> 00:49:40,570
Scott: right act one was discs act two is streaming.

827
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:41,655
Scott: They need a third act.

828
00:49:41,936 --> 00:49:44,126
Scott: if they don't have a third act which could happen, right?

829
00:49:44,367 --> 00:49:45,170
Scott: I'm 50/50.

830
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:48,024
Scott: They're either gonna have a third act or they're gonna level off now.

831
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:49,029
Rym: See I will forget about.

832
00:49:49,049 --> 00:49:49,974
Rym: I mean I'm not gonna growth.

833
00:49:50,034 --> 00:49:52,890
Rym: growth of the company, but I don't think they need a third act.

834
00:49:53,291 --> 00:49:54,374
Rym: I think what's going to happen.

835
00:49:54,414 --> 00:50:10,001
Rym: my straight prediction for you know, visual media in the next year in 2011 is that Netflix is going to slowly transition to becoming a streaming only company and the DVD part is going to drop off and be a kind of an add-on that you Can pay for if you want DVDs?

836
00:50:10,363 --> 00:50:11,570
Scott: Yeah, that's already sort of happened.

837
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:15,224
Rym: Oh, I think what they're going to add is a function.

838
00:50:15,284 --> 00:50:16,510
Rym: this is just total speculation.

839
00:50:16,993 --> 00:50:19,570
Rym: Instead of having a. you know, you keep getting DVDs.

840
00:50:19,972 --> 00:50:28,330
Rym: You have the streaming only and if there's something that isn't streaming You can from your viewer whatever it is say send me the DVD and they charge you like a dollar.

841
00:50:29,512 --> 00:50:35,204
Rym: Maybe I think they'll do that because they have to leverage the DVD not a bad Inventory that they have but they don't like.

842
00:50:35,244 --> 00:50:36,390
Rym: no one wants the DVDs.

843
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:39,884
Rym: They only want the DVDs because they can't get anything like.

844
00:50:39,904 --> 00:50:41,390
Rym: they can't get the stuff that's on DVD.

845
00:50:41,774 --> 00:50:42,930
Scott: Here's what I understand, right?

846
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:48,530
Scott: It's like care about extras by and large if they have it the basically Netflix effectively has you know infinity DVDs.

847
00:50:48,831 --> 00:50:52,104
Scott: Right if you ask for a video, you know, and you want to watch it.

848
00:50:52,867 --> 00:50:53,550
Scott: They have a disc.

849
00:50:53,971 --> 00:50:57,647
Scott: Yeah, you know it's never a situation where it's like, oh we don't have another copy of it.

850
00:50:58,048 --> 00:51:01,121
Scott: You're right So why can't legally?

851
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,370
Scott: I know Lee it is obviously illegal, right?

852
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:07,285
Scott: But you know in terms of right and wrong, they should be able to stream anything.

853
00:51:07,305 --> 00:51:08,490
Scott: They have a disc for right?

854
00:51:08,752 --> 00:51:10,585
Scott: It's really in effect no different.

855
00:51:10,625 --> 00:51:11,209
Scott: they've paid for.

856
00:51:11,229 --> 00:51:17,253
Rym: no It would only be no different if it was set up such that only one streamer could stream per DVD They owned in their vault.

857
00:51:17,854 --> 00:51:19,318
Scott: All right fine, which is fine.

858
00:51:19,739 --> 00:51:21,203
Rym: So they yes got copyright law.

859
00:51:21,624 --> 00:51:24,292
Scott: Yeah, but I just say you know So that.

860
00:51:24,312 --> 00:51:25,941
Rym: but anyway, that's my prediction for Netflix.

861
00:51:25,961 --> 00:51:29,616
Rym: but to with the whole streaming in general I think we're gonna see huge balkanization.

862
00:51:29,636 --> 00:51:31,261
Rym: I think Hulu is going to fail.

863
00:51:31,782 --> 00:51:32,083
Scott: really.

864
00:51:32,264 --> 00:51:44,460
Rym: in 2011 Hulu might not disappear But Hulu is rapidly be getting fucked by all those interests of the different studios that make shows and as you know Like NBC there's all these mergers being talked about.

865
00:51:44,962 --> 00:52:07,066
Rym: the industry TV industry is not doing that well and I think what's going to happen is that Hulu is going to kind of collapse under this balkanization where Every studio will allow like one or two episodes of their show to be on Hulu But they'll hope they'll have links back to their personal streaming site a la Comedy Central and I think bit by bit every every peep.

866
00:52:07,147 --> 00:52:15,720
Rym: every network and every person that makes shows is Going to try to bring people to their own site and try to keep people away from the centralized things like Hulu.

867
00:52:16,182 --> 00:52:17,547
Scott: That's not a prediction for the future.

868
00:52:17,587 --> 00:52:19,254
Scott: That's that's a seeing.

869
00:52:19,334 --> 00:52:20,680
Scott: what is you know, that is the past.

870
00:52:20,781 --> 00:52:21,919
Scott: That is what has already happened.

871
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:30,067
Rym: It hasn't happened yet because all those sites all the balkanized sites suck and people do just go to Hulu and if Hulu doesn't Have it they go to BitTorrent.

872
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:31,034
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

873
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:31,960
Scott: I think what's gonna happen?

874
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,771
Rym: That's why Netflix is doing so well because Netflix no one cares.

875
00:52:34,972 --> 00:52:37,772
Rym: very few people care about seeing stuff right now and the people that Do just pirate it.

876
00:52:38,422 --> 00:52:44,233
Rym: Netflix is gonna be the only Centralized streaming site that survives the balkanization.

877
00:52:44,373 --> 00:52:52,540
Scott: I think that things like the Google TV It's actually surprisingly right, especially since you just saw a million Apple TVs sold the new ones, right?

878
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:57,355
Scott: I think the Google TV is actually gonna do well and I think I thought it was going to.

879
00:52:57,395 --> 00:52:58,940
Rym: did you read the recent articles?

880
00:52:59,100 --> 00:52:59,343
Rym: About how?

881
00:52:59,363 --> 00:53:03,027
Rym: yeah, Google is basically Slowing it the fuck down and they're they've.

882
00:53:03,127 --> 00:53:04,894
Rym: they're downplaying the press releases now.

883
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:13,376
Rym: There are commercials for it on TV Yeah And now they're pulling back and a lot of the devices that were Scheduled to be shown at CES are not going to be there.

884
00:53:13,416 --> 00:53:22,036
Rym: I saw one at pecs Yeah, and there's this pullback and I don't think Google TV is gonna be viable in 2011 I think cause this balkanization is going to fuck them.

885
00:53:22,056 --> 00:53:26,332
Rym: Google TV Relies upon there being places like who I think Hulu is.

886
00:53:26,352 --> 00:53:26,793
Rym: now.

887
00:53:26,813 --> 00:53:31,134
Scott: they can just write a plug-in for every single new place It's not a problem and then the new places will block those plugins.

888
00:53:31,496 --> 00:53:34,875
Rym: It doesn't matter They're going to do it and Google won't do there.

889
00:53:34,896 --> 00:53:37,548
Rym: You know, you know Google They're not going to play the game of.

890
00:53:37,829 --> 00:53:39,155
Rym: you're blocking our agent string.

891
00:53:39,175 --> 00:53:40,320
Rym: So we're gonna change the agent string.

892
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,083
Rym: They're just gonna give up.

893
00:53:41,324 --> 00:53:49,672
Scott: No, I think the Google TV, you know, the boxy box clearly I don't think did you know as well mostly because you know boxy.

894
00:53:49,752 --> 00:53:52,520
Scott: anyone who want knew about or wanted run boxy already had.

895
00:53:52,700 --> 00:54:03,306
Scott: You know just ran boxy on a computer, you know, the boxy boxes is not didn't have this wide market But I think the Google TV and the Apple TV, you know, which seem to be getting more I think in 2010 you're gonna see.

896
00:54:03,668 --> 00:54:07,736
Scott: you know, the cable companies are gonna start to hurt as more and more people It's gonna accelerate.

897
00:54:07,756 --> 00:54:11,110
Scott: Oh, yeah The rate of people dropping cable and satellite will accelerate.

898
00:54:11,271 --> 00:54:14,080
Rym: my three-year prediction is that within three years?

899
00:54:14,422 --> 00:54:16,234
Rym: It will not be a viable business.

900
00:54:16,395 --> 00:54:22,720
Scott: in 2012 You're gonna see the breaking but in 2011 is gonna be a big lead-up to more and more people.

901
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:24,220
Scott: Just you're gonna be dropping cable.

902
00:54:24,481 --> 00:54:27,758
Rym: I agree, but I think what they're going to go to Google

903
00:54:27,778 --> 00:54:27,979
Scott: TV

904
00:54:28,904 --> 00:54:38,830
Rym: The way it's supposed to work the way they demoed it really only functions well when there are places like Hulu that are viable and as a result the people are gonna adopt Hulu TV or Hulu TV.

905
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:51,979
Rym: Google TV in 2011 are going to the people who have large collections of pirated video and people who will use it to stream their Netflix and People who use it to stream the few things that the people who produce content will allow to be streamed on Google TV.

906
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:59,140
Rym: I think most other people are going to block it and are going to basically extort Google and say pay us or we'll block Google TV.

907
00:54:59,523 --> 00:55:03,890
Scott: You know, normally you'd think that would be true But here's the one difference between boxy and Google.

908
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:06,520
Scott: right is basically you don't extort.

909
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,151
Scott: You can extort the boxy people.

910
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:08,855
Scott: you may boxy.

911
00:55:08,875 --> 00:55:09,560
Scott: We're shutting you down.

912
00:55:10,041 --> 00:55:11,306
Scott: You can't shut Google down.

913
00:55:11,486 --> 00:55:13,974
Scott: all these people are sucking at the teat of Google.

914
00:55:14,015 --> 00:55:15,660
Scott: They will not go and fight with them.

915
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:16,967
Scott: They want Google's love.

916
00:55:16,987 --> 00:55:17,952
Scott: They're like Google.

917
00:55:18,254 --> 00:55:25,019
Scott: send people to my website But they hate Google because they realize that They hate it because they can't get away from it.

918
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,005
Scott: Oh, they had.

919
00:55:26,045 --> 00:55:28,758
Scott: they pay Google a zillion dollars every year for ads.

920
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:35,356
Scott: this Bring in more money than you know, then they pay for that and this is the trouble.

921
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:36,640
Rym: This is the net neutrality thing.

922
00:55:36,981 --> 00:55:42,236
Rym: I think all the content producers are going to try to collude to keep Google out.

923
00:55:42,697 --> 00:55:43,279
Scott: No, you can't.

924
00:55:44,461 --> 00:55:53,166
Rym: Oh, it won't work in the long run, but I think it's going to hold Google TV from being mass-market successful Until after 2011.

925
00:55:53,166 --> 00:55:55,855
Rym: Google TV is not going to be a major player in 2011.

926
00:55:55,855 --> 00:55:56,337
Rym: It'll be alright.

927
00:55:56,357 --> 00:55:57,160
Rym: You heard it here first.

928
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:58,364
Rym: It's got so wrong.

929
00:55:58,424 --> 00:55:58,945
Rym: It'll be good.

930
00:55:58,986 --> 00:56:01,072
Rym: There's no way I'm so.

931
00:56:01,092 --> 00:56:02,376
Scott: they already have the devices.

932
00:56:02,396 --> 00:56:03,519
Scott: They're putting commercials on TV.

933
00:56:04,001 --> 00:56:07,212
Scott: Yeah people, you know, I think that people people go for it.

934
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:09,300
Rym: Yeah, I don't think people are gonna go forward enough.

935
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:14,540
Rym: it's not gonna be a major player because People who use Google TV are just gonna use it for the same thing.

936
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:19,600
Rym: They use everything else for the stream Netflix because that's gonna be one of the few things that's reliable on it?

937
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,844
Scott: No, it's gonna be I think.

938
00:56:20,904 --> 00:56:26,600
Scott: I think you know, you underestimate the the ability of Google TV to to get content.

939
00:56:27,042 --> 00:56:30,500
Rym: There's too much too much movement among the content producers to try.

940
00:56:31,381 --> 00:56:32,607
Scott: That's what Google does best.

941
00:56:32,728 --> 00:56:35,039
Scott: is they search the web to collect content, right?

942
00:56:35,841 --> 00:56:37,010
Scott: That's that's their thing.

943
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:37,513
Scott: They can't.

944
00:56:37,533 --> 00:56:38,400
Scott: they're not gonna get it wrong.

945
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,055
Rym: Well, here's the thing Google TV will succeed in.

946
00:56:41,095 --> 00:56:41,659
Rym: this kind of.

947
00:56:42,467 --> 00:56:55,790
Rym: between the two Google TV is going to allow YouTube TV aka watching stupid dumbass videos on YouTube and college humor and things like that to displace Traditional content production entirely.

948
00:56:56,072 --> 00:56:59,487
Rym: No, Google TV is gonna kick it now It's only gonna take.

949
00:56:59,527 --> 00:57:01,860
Rym: kick it for alternative stuff and for Netflix.

950
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:06,536
Rym: It's not gonna kick it for broadcast TV because broadcast TV is going to fight to the bitter end.

951
00:57:06,857 --> 00:57:07,399
Scott: It's gonna kick it.

952
00:57:08,122 --> 00:57:10,110
Rym: Anyway, I think we've heard you have any one leg.

953
00:57:10,411 --> 00:57:10,953
Rym: We're done here.

954
00:57:10,973 --> 00:57:11,315
Rym: Do you have?

955
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:12,620
Rym: we should each make one?

956
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:13,686
Scott: Oh, there's a lot of other things.

957
00:57:13,747 --> 00:57:15,359
Scott: I want to talk about talking for an hour.

958
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:20,415
Scott: Well, I wanted to talk about how open source is gonna be hurting big time about that's.

959
00:57:20,977 --> 00:57:23,106
Rym: I think that's obvious though It's just at web app.

960
00:57:23,207 --> 00:57:25,500
Scott: ever since Oracle bought Sun, right?

961
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,085
Scott: That's was a huge hit.

962
00:57:27,226 --> 00:57:31,948
Scott: and then on top of that all the developers are basically just making websites It's not?

963
00:57:32,008 --> 00:57:38,179
Scott: you know, I talked about you know The other week how people main was having trouble getting developers, right?

964
00:57:38,259 --> 00:57:44,258
Rym: Oh, yeah Well, I'm gonna extend this because I want to make a crazy prediction more people are using Apple products as opposed to.

965
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:51,520
Rym: I think what's Gonna happen is X windows is gonna really drop off in support and updates.

966
00:57:51,781 --> 00:57:59,604
Rym: Oh, that's definitely true in 2011 because one Ubuntu which probably has one of the bigger pools of developers is Dropping X.

967
00:57:59,705 --> 00:58:07,920
Scott: Yeah, and to that Linux on the desktop is dead Yeah, so I mean it's gonna be a bad times for the open source world, right?

968
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:17,509
Scott: you know open source for in terms of its ability to serve websites and its ability to scale and all that stuff and You know run in the cloud and all.

969
00:58:17,529 --> 00:58:19,459
Scott: that's where all the attention is right now.

970
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:27,700
Rym: databases Scaling website something about what we use the internet for the content itself is actually the only thing that matters.

971
00:58:27,861 --> 00:58:38,957
Rym: Yeah, and all in all the other departments Open source is gonna do poorly in 2011 because people are much They want their content and they don't care about what's going on behind the scenes.

972
00:58:39,178 --> 00:58:43,274
Scott: Yeah I think that 3d is gonna be.

973
00:58:43,294 --> 00:58:44,420
Scott: I don't know.

974
00:58:45,002 --> 00:58:46,307
Scott: I think that you will definitely see.

975
00:58:46,467 --> 00:58:49,860
Scott: as you know, there's gonna be definitely more 3d movies in the theaters if you know.

976
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,260
Rym: If there could be more here's a prediction.

977
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:54,639
Rym: I think that you want Netflix's next big thing.

978
00:58:55,181 --> 00:58:57,488
Rym: You want them to have a third pillar like a new move.

979
00:58:57,869 --> 00:59:03,164
Rym: it'll be when they have both subtitle support and That's not a very.

980
00:59:03,184 --> 00:59:04,831
Scott: that's not a third pillar a third pillar.

981
00:59:04,972 --> 00:59:06,096
Rym: No, cuz that that will.

982
00:59:06,237 --> 00:59:06,940
Scott: that's just features.

983
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:08,167
Scott: That's not a whole new business.

984
00:59:08,187 --> 00:59:09,675
Scott: streaming is a whole new business Scott.

985
00:59:09,716 --> 00:59:10,480
Rym: That was just a problem.

986
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,704
Rym: That's just like one huge feature.

987
00:59:11,765 --> 00:59:14,615
Rym: But the real one will be when they have 3d movies.

988
00:59:14,655 --> 00:59:16,080
Scott: That's not a new business model.

989
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:17,987
Rym: Well, they'll never have a new business.

990
00:59:18,027 --> 00:59:20,455
Scott: They did they had discs and then they had streaming.

991
00:59:20,475 --> 00:59:23,182
Scott: they could I'd be need a third thing Happen.

992
00:59:23,443 --> 00:59:24,467
Rym: what would that in the next year?

993
00:59:24,487 --> 00:59:25,250
Rym: It could happen.

994
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:28,060
Scott: what they're gonna need something cuz streaming isn't gonna last forever.

995
00:59:29,621 --> 00:59:30,730
Rym: That's how you get content.

996
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:31,979
Rym: They'll be the content provider.

997
00:59:32,941 --> 00:59:35,360
Scott: There's gonna be a streaming is only gonna hold out for so long.

998
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:42,813
Scott: 2011 is not going to see the decline of streaming Scott No But I think what's gonna happen is that everyone will already be signed up for it and then what?

999
00:59:43,356 --> 00:59:45,344
Rym: and then you continue to make Money forever.

1000
00:59:45,544 --> 00:59:46,147
Scott: No, you need to.

1001
00:59:46,167 --> 00:59:46,789
Scott: you need to keep.

1002
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:48,475
Scott: you need to keep doing something.

1003
00:59:48,515 --> 00:59:49,660
Scott: You need another another move.

1004
00:59:50,681 --> 00:59:55,857
Rym: No, that's actually a stupid thing to say because that's pretty much what drives most businesses into the ground.

1005
00:59:55,918 --> 01:00:01,163
Scott: people would have said this You just did the same thing about DVDs and you know the 90 in 2000.

1006
01:00:01,163 --> 01:00:02,066
Rym: no because here's the thing.

1007
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:06,220
Rym: when you're when you're in an industry where you have a cash cow your work on something.

1008
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,495
Rym: Yes, but that's kind of an irrelevant discussion.

1009
01:00:08,515 --> 01:00:09,922
Rym: That's just obvious You weren't?

1010
01:00:09,942 --> 01:00:10,946
Rym: you know your shareholders?

1011
01:00:11,026 --> 01:00:14,720
Rym: you work on some other thing and then you have a sunset plan for your business.

1012
01:00:15,082 --> 01:00:17,696
Rym: Streaming is not going to sunset in the next decade.

1013
01:00:17,716 --> 01:00:21,608
Scott: Yeah Sunset a lot sooner than you think.

1014
01:00:21,709 --> 01:00:24,120
Rym: All right, so what's gonna replace it in terms of getting media?

1015
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,112
Scott: How long did Netflix's DVD thing last is?

1016
01:00:27,152 --> 01:00:28,900
Scott: pretty much, you know, it's going downhill now.

1017
01:00:29,201 --> 01:00:32,372
Rym: Well because we went from you know, non streaming to streaming.

1018
01:00:32,412 --> 01:00:34,380
Scott: Yeah, that's gonna be streaming to something else.

1019
01:00:34,821 --> 01:00:35,404
Scott: What else?

1020
01:00:35,544 --> 01:00:39,360
Scott: just as quickly as a DVD mailing went out streaming is gonna go out.

1021
01:00:40,143 --> 01:00:40,585
Rym: Alright Scott.

1022
01:00:40,646 --> 01:00:41,771
Rym: I want to watch a video.

1023
01:00:41,892 --> 01:00:43,694
Scott: if I knew what the what else was No.

1024
01:00:44,861 --> 01:00:49,649
Rym: Saying streaming is gonna go out is like saying that Moving between places is going.

1025
01:00:49,689 --> 01:00:52,300
Scott: you would have said the same thing if I would have said DVDs were gonna go out.

1026
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:54,189
Rym: No, I would have said ten years ago.

1027
01:00:54,209 --> 01:00:55,053
Rym: I would said yes someday.

1028
01:00:55,093 --> 01:00:57,466
Rym: We'll just download all this on the Internet Uh-huh.

1029
01:00:57,587 --> 01:00:59,320
Scott: So you can't even imagine anything beyond the Internet's.

1030
01:01:00,641 --> 01:01:03,533
Rym: Yes, I can but they're not relevant to the discussion of getting media.

1031
01:01:03,574 --> 01:01:04,939
Scott: got no imaginations over there.

1032
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:05,702
Rym: It's got.

1033
01:01:05,742 --> 01:01:07,487
Rym: streaming is just a concept of.

1034
01:01:07,507 --> 01:01:12,362
Rym: there is audio visual media of some kind or maybe you know feel ease It doesn't matter.

1035
01:01:12,403 --> 01:01:14,453
Rym: There is content that is made feelings.

1036
01:01:14,493 --> 01:01:15,820
Scott: That would be that would be a whole new thing.

1037
01:01:15,981 --> 01:01:17,500
Rym: Yeah, but you're just streaming the feelings.

1038
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:25,900
Rym: Anyway, I think it's a silly argument to say that Netflix needs to worry about the end of streaming and make a new business model.

1039
01:01:26,025 --> 01:01:28,664
Scott: They do Know that.

1040
01:01:28,744 --> 01:01:29,647
Scott: I guarantee that they are.

1041
01:01:29,687 --> 01:01:31,231
Scott: they already have something.

1042
01:01:31,251 --> 01:01:34,040
Scott: Uh, what they doubt, you know, they Netflix, you know.

1043
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:45,080
Scott: They purposefully called the business Netflix, you know as opposed to they were gonna call it like DVDs by mail But they called it Netflix because right they didn't what they already knew that they weren't being limited to this one thing.

1044
01:01:45,246 --> 01:01:49,980
Rym: Yes Because everyone's known since the beginning that someday we download videos over the Internet.

1045
01:01:50,542 --> 01:01:55,800
Scott: They know that they're going to be about delivering movies or whatever in whatever form and whatever.

1046
01:01:56,101 --> 01:01:59,370
Scott: You know means that that may be and it will not be streaming.

1047
01:01:59,471 --> 01:02:01,557
Scott: It's got streaming over Internet.

1048
01:02:01,577 --> 01:02:03,684
Rym: It's not a technology It's a concept.

1049
01:02:03,824 --> 01:02:05,991
Scott: It will not be streaming over internets or street.

1050
01:02:06,031 --> 01:02:07,115
Scott: It will be something else.

1051
01:02:07,536 --> 01:02:08,820
Scott: They have another move.

1052
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:13,112
Rym: What I get the content over some sort of wireless network.

1053
01:02:13,474 --> 01:02:15,540
Scott: if you listen you're thinking much too.

1054
01:02:16,081 --> 01:02:19,112
Rym: You're thinking stupidly abstractly and not saying any.

1055
01:02:19,393 --> 01:02:22,983
Scott: and when Netflix makes a move you're gonna be like, ah shit I'm gonna be like I was right.

1056
01:02:23,043 --> 01:02:26,974
Rym: Yes when they stop giving content to people because that's what streaming is.

1057
01:02:27,155 --> 01:02:33,828
Scott: Anyway, anyway Netflix is gonna have a third there.

1058
01:02:33,888 --> 01:02:36,900
Scott: if they're they're either gonna go out completely or they're gonna have a third move.

1059
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:42,680
Rym: They have a third move, you know, what is gonna be actually making content or funding people to like studios.

1060
01:02:43,364 --> 01:02:44,372
Rym: But then you know what they're gonna do.

1061
01:02:44,593 --> 01:02:45,379
Rym: They're gonna distribute it.

1062
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,329
Rym: You know how they can distribute it over the internet.

1063
01:02:47,469 --> 01:02:49,700
Scott: now streaming I can have something new new move.

1064
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:51,201
