1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,087
Rym: Hey, it's Tuesday, September 17th, 2013.

2
00:00:13,087 --> 00:00:13,439
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,140
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,480
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,200
Rym: We're back from everything, we're not going anywhere in a while, and we're feeling salty.

6
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:23,039
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,980
Rym: So is it Darude or Darude?

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,996
Rym: To paraphrase what Scott just asked me- I'm looking it up.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,739
Rym: And I realized in my entire life I've been saying it alternatingly.

10
00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:36,019
Scott: I think it's Darude.

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:36,859
Rym: You know what?

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,780
Rym: I'm gonna say Darude because I still say Macanized Supremacy off and on, even though that is also incorrect.

13
00:00:42,822 --> 00:00:44,000
Rym: Or at least is incorrect.

14
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,360
Scott: I don't know if it's- How to pronounce Darude in Finnish.

15
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,238
Rym: In Finnish.

16
00:00:48,023 --> 00:00:48,438
Rym: That helps.

17
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,215
Scott: Hold on.

18
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,580
Rym: Is it really- should we pronounce it in Finnish or in American?

19
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:56,047
Rym: Darude.

20
00:00:56,198 --> 00:00:56,350
Scott: Darude.

21
00:00:56,691 --> 00:00:57,288
Scott: It is Darude.

22
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:58,528
Scott: Darude.

23
00:00:58,571 --> 00:00:59,065
Scott: It is Darude.

24
00:01:00,117 --> 00:01:00,849
Scott: Is he a Finnish guy?

25
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:01,829
Scott: Yeah, he's a Finnish guy.

26
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,429
Rym: Alright, yeah, we'll say it like that from now on.

27
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,708
Rym: But yeah, that's that song.

28
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:13,863
Rym: So, because Emily didn't go to PAX, I got back from PAX and she was like, "I kinda wanna go to a con because I missed a

29
00:01:13,883 --> 00:01:14,268
Rym: con.".

30
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:18,030
Scott: If you wanna go to a con, pretty much any weekend, there's a con to go to somewhere.

31
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,229
Scott: It might be a tiny shitty con, there's a con.

32
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:26,789
Rym: So for many years, all of our cool friends would go to SPX and there's always some other shit going on and we just never went to it.

33
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:33,748
Scott: I never went to SPX because they basically assumed it was Mocha 2.0 just in DC and I was like, "Why go to DC for the same con I've already been to this

34
00:01:33,788 --> 00:01:33,929
Scott: year?".

35
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:45,509
Rym: Yup, so we decided to go, I'm not gonna review the con, save that for another time, but we went to SPX, just me and Emily, we brought along Loldwell, which made for some lols in the car on the way down.

36
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,190
Rym: You can't have a non-lol time with someone with lols in their hand.

37
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:57,788
Rym: It was also weird because I realized, you know, people kept, like other CollegeHumor people and just all these people kept coming up to us at the party we were in and they were like, "Oh yes, how do you two know each

38
00:01:57,828 --> 00:01:57,970
Rym: other?".

39
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,490
Rym: We looked at each other and we never really had a good answer for that.

40
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:02,189
Scott: No we don't.

41
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:09,589
Rym: Like, we both know Conrad, we follow each other on Twitter, that's pretty much it.

42
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,069
Rym: And then at the party, I didn't even know, like there were people who showed up, but anyway I digress.

43
00:02:16,012 --> 00:02:22,309
Rym: So SPX was pretty cool and we hung out and did the thing and I can see why the tweets that come out of it every year are the way they are.

44
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,445
Rym: I learned about its innermost traditions like, "Imagine if PAX had a chocolate

45
00:02:27,486 --> 00:02:27,807
Rym: fountain.".

46
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,588
Scott: It does.

47
00:02:30,232 --> 00:02:35,570
Rym: No, like an official chocolate fountain that happened at like 11 o'clock on Saturday in the con.

48
00:02:36,251 --> 00:02:36,484
Scott: It does.

49
00:02:37,038 --> 00:02:37,229
Rym: Where?

50
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:37,599
Rym: Eland.

51
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:38,188
Rym: Yeah.

52
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,830
Rym: That's not, that's special.

53
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,130
Rym: Also there is no chocolate fountain there.

54
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:43,149
Scott: Oh is there?

55
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:45,549
Rym: Also I do not trust chocolate fountains.

56
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:45,877
Scott: No.

57
00:02:46,911 --> 00:02:51,654
Rym: Because I've decided that the SPX chocolate fountain is in fact the same chocolate every year.

58
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:52,574
Scott: Whoa.

59
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:56,520
Rym: But yeah, there's a lot of cool stuff I can say about SPX.

60
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:06,050
Rym: but my opening bit, the reason I bring this up now instead of on a Wednesday show or a Thursday show, is that we drove there and that was fine.

61
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:13,129
Rym: We got to this place and it has been a long time since I've been to a convention that was not in a city.

62
00:03:14,132 --> 00:03:17,730
Rym: It was in a convention center in Bethesda by itself.

63
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:24,467
Rym: You had to drive to it and we were like, "Hey, let's walk outside, look at our phone and see what food we can

64
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:24,690
Rym: get.".

65
00:03:24,876 --> 00:03:25,210
Scott: Nothing.

66
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:31,070
Rym: There were two pizza places, neither of which was open because it was a weekend, and they were both like half a mile away.

67
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,290
Scott: Might as well be Hartford, Connecticut.

68
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:38,470
Rym: Hartford is a cornucopia of dinner compared to Bethesda.

69
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,849
Scott: And you know I like cornucopias.

70
00:03:40,132 --> 00:03:40,805
Rym: I know you do.

71
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,304
Rym: So we see this Chinese place and Emily's like, "Let's just go,".

72
00:03:44,344 --> 00:03:45,643
Rym: and I'm like, "I'm super dubious.

73
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,506
Rym: I'm the most dubious that a room has ever

74
00:03:48,547 --> 00:03:48,748
Rym: been.".

75
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:51,186
Rym: And she's like, "Oh come on, you're always down on

76
00:03:51,206 --> 00:03:51,246
Rym: me.".

77
00:03:51,992 --> 00:03:53,390
Scott: And we're always right, Emily.

78
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:55,778
Rym: So she's like, "Yeah, we should eat at this place,".

79
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,510
Rym: and I'm like, "Eh, not super feelin'

80
00:03:58,676 --> 00:03:58,821
Rym: it.".

81
00:03:59,173 --> 00:03:59,868
Rym: And then we go in.

82
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,190
Scott: Meanwhile, every time we're not feeling something, it turns out that we're right.

83
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:13,650
Scott: You know, I see where she's coming from every time this kind of thing happens, but let's talk about the story of eating the weird vegetables at the diner, or the story about getting the salad at the Fudd Ruckus.

84
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,550
Rym: No, it wasn't a salad, it was like a chicken sandwich.

85
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,010
Scott: We're always sadly correct on these issues.

86
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:28,790
Rym: Well, I think in general in my life, the times I've been burned by being optimistic were way worse than the times I was burned by being pessimistic.

87
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:37,997
Rym: But we walk in, and then I see her go *sniff sniff* like take a little sniff, and then she's like, "Ehhhhh,".

88
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:40,448
Rym: and I was like, "Eh, let's walk back out the

89
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:40,750
Rym: door.".

90
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,029
Rym: And then we walked back out the door, went back to the hotel.

91
00:04:43,171 --> 00:04:44,450
Scott: What smelled in that restaurant?

92
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,110
Rym: Smelled just like shitty Chinese restaurant.

93
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,050
Rym: Like shit-tier Chinese.

94
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:54,987
Rym: Remember when we couldn't get the good Chinese food planned D&D at RIT because it was too late?

95
00:04:55,390 --> 00:05:02,210
Rym: So we'd get like the worst Chinese food, the one that would deliver, and it'd always be like vaguely room temperature instead of hot.

96
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:06,130
Rym: So yeah, we went back to the hotel and ate there.

97
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:13,230
Rym: If you live in that area, and there was tons of huge apartment buildings right there, there is fucking nothing.

98
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:14,497
Rym: Nothing.

99
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:21,849
Rym: So the other reason I bring all this up is that I go to check in, and they gave me the presidential suite.

100
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:23,988
Rym: I don't know why.

101
00:05:24,556 --> 00:05:25,530
Rym: The room was a palace.

102
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,969
Rym: My entire apartment could fit in it a couple times over.

103
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,630
Rym: So we did what any good person would do, and we threw the cool kids party.

104
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:40,090
Rym: And a lot of people who were cool showed up, and I wanted to give a shout out to everyone who was cool who showed up at our party.

105
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,030
Rym: You all know who you were, and thank you for helping me rearrange some of that artwork.

106
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,390
Rym: I wonder if the hotel will notice.

107
00:05:49,531 --> 00:05:50,869
Scott: So, here's the funny news.

108
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:58,427
Scott: Recently, people were complaining, or I don't know if they were complaining, but they were discussing like, "Hey, how come no one's brought back

109
00:05:58,487 --> 00:05:59,150
Scott: HeroQuest?".

110
00:05:59,491 --> 00:06:04,869
Scott: And my post was, if you've listened to the show, you know, HeroQuest is the He-Man of board games.

111
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:10,590
Rym: Yeah, I think we did a show on replaying HeroQuest.

112
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:17,570
Rym: I'm going to try to find that show and see if we in fact did, because if you summarize- It sucks balls.

113
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,110
Scott: It is a piece of shit.

114
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:25,450
Scott: Even if you want to play that genre of game, of, you know, basically NetHack with a board, just play Descent.

115
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:30,069
Scott: And I don't even like Descent, but it's, or, you know, there's a whole bunch of these games that are basically just dungeon crawl games.

116
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:30,359
Scott: Help!

117
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,470
Scott: Play fucking Dungeons and Dragons!

118
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,090
Rym: HeroQuest is not the worst of that genre.

119
00:06:36,552 --> 00:06:37,449
Rym: I will say that.

120
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:51,249
Rym: It had some cool things going for it, and really, the problem was just that if you follow the game by the book, the game becomes trivial because the players kick in every door and kill everything in the room in one hit.

121
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,610
Rym: It's like when you're leveled up too far in Fire Emblem.

122
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,889
Scott: So here's the details, right?

123
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:00,610
Scott: A Spanish company named GameZone is going to create this anniversary edition.

124
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:05,669
Scott: They have distribution rights to Spain, but nowhere else, so I guess in Spain they really love HeroQuest.

125
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,507
Rym: Didn't they say they're going to release it in a bunch of other languages as well, because fuck you?

126
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,808
Scott: They will do so, which means you can buy it, even if you're not in Spain, you just got to get it shipped over, you know?

127
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:19,069
Scott: There may be some sort of Kickstarter crowdfunding, but they don't know.

128
00:07:19,931 --> 00:07:22,090
Scott: There's going to be four heroes, male and female.

129
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,650
Scott: They're still going to have the 3D plastic furniture.

130
00:07:26,171 --> 00:07:33,010
Scott: It's going to have a reversible board, so two different maps, and there won't be Fimirs, but there will be equivalent reptilian creatures.

131
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,890
Scott: I guess there's some licensing issue or something?

132
00:07:34,991 --> 00:07:36,870
Rym: How can there be a licensing issue on Fimir?

133
00:07:37,194 --> 00:07:37,747
Scott: I don't know.

134
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:38,308
Scott: I don't know.

135
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:39,950
Scott: And it won't be expensive.

136
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:45,429
Scott: It'll be about the same price as Descent version two, in which case, just buy fucking Descent version two.

137
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:46,870
Scott: I don't like Descent.

138
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:48,530
Rym: All right, there's a whole Wikipedia article.

139
00:07:49,314 --> 00:07:51,090
Scott: Way, way, way better.

140
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:58,289
Rym: Fimir are a fantasy race created by Graham Davis and Jess Goodwin at the end of the 1980s Warhammer fantasy roleplay.

141
00:07:59,933 --> 00:08:00,702
Scott: This is why.

142
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:02,887
Scott: This is why.

143
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,390
Rym: Oh, they were, Walt, okay.

144
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:18,070
Rym: In the Wikipedia article, they created, they wanted a race to be as distinctive of Warhammer as the Bruar of RuneQuest, however, the Fimir did not prove popular.

145
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,570
Rym: They made a guest appearance in Milton Bradley's HeroQuest.

146
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:27,089
Rym: Very few official sources remain published on Fimirs.

147
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:29,110
Scott: I thought it's a Fimir.

148
00:08:30,013 --> 00:08:31,070
Rym: I always said Fimir as a kid.

149
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,710
Scott: Fimir would start with F-E, like the bone of Fimir.

150
00:08:34,293 --> 00:08:37,890
Rym: Yeah, because I is always pronounced I and E and not E.

151
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:38,868
Scott: It could be a Fimir.

152
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,190
Rym: It could be a Fimer.

153
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:42,029
Scott: Is there a pronunciation there?

154
00:08:42,692 --> 00:08:43,969
Rym: Uh, no, there is not.

155
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,330
Scott: I'm sticking with Fimir.

156
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,109
Rym: I'm going to say Fimir.

157
00:08:47,571 --> 00:08:48,290
Scott: Fimir is a bone.

158
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,689
Scott: Fimir is F-E-M-U-R.

159
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:59,490
Rym: Fimir society is divided into a case system consisting of the Merg, the Dirac, the Warriors, and the Sheerl.

160
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,189
Scott: All right, listen.

161
00:09:00,431 --> 00:09:02,610
Rym: The Merg is also known as the Witch Hag.

162
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:10,810
Scott: If the word Fimir, F-E-M-U-R, for the bone, the large leg bone, did not already exist, I would pronounce that as Fimir.

163
00:09:11,654 --> 00:09:12,969
Rym: Okay, I will grant you that.

164
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:17,450
Scott: Because that word already exists, a different spelling must have a different pronunciation.

165
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,570
Rym: Okay, there's a lot of information on Fimir society here.

166
00:09:21,132 --> 00:09:24,906
Scott: Yeah, if you pick any Warhammer race, how much fucking information do you think there's going to be?

167
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,390
Rym: Well, I guess it's a dead race now.

168
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,870
Scott: What are those, like, zombie robot guys?

169
00:09:29,232 --> 00:09:29,936
Rym: Now, I'm convinced.

170
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:32,090
Rym: to this day, when I was a kid, I used to play Hero Quest.

171
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:35,210
Rym: Me, my little brother, and my dad was the game master.

172
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,550
Scott: And you were too dumb to realize the things we know today?

173
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:38,928
Scott: Uh, no.

174
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,090
Scott: Rolling the dice doesn't matter.

175
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:46,970
Rym: My dad cheated by accident in that, one, we thought Fimers could cast fucking spells just because we were dumb.

176
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,770
Scott: Okay, where did you figure that out?

177
00:09:48,951 --> 00:09:49,849
Rym: I don't know, we just did.

178
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:50,246
Rym: All right.

179
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,010
Rym: Fimers cast spells.

180
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,149
Rym: Everything Fimir and up could cast spells.

181
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:53,669
Scott: Sure.

182
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,410
Rym: And they could cast any goddamn spell.

183
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:55,830
Rym: Sure.

184
00:09:56,211 --> 00:09:58,210
Rym: So that actually made the game slightly challenging.

185
00:09:58,313 --> 00:09:58,788
Scott: Sure, okay.

186
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:08,169
Rym: But, uh, I'm convinced to this day that my little brother went and got the book, looked up where that fucking, what Borin's armor was.

187
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:16,807
Rym: Because when we got to that map, you know, we're doing our normal thing, and my brother just makes a beeline as the elf toward this part of the map that I'm like, "Don't go over there yet.

188
00:10:16,871 --> 00:10:17,390
Rym: It's dangerous.

189
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,080
Rym: Finish up over

190
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:18,284
Rym: here.".

191
00:10:18,671 --> 00:10:23,424
Rym: And just searches this one fucking room and finds this chest with this magic goddamn armor in it.

192
00:10:24,632 --> 00:10:27,469
Rym: Even though I was the barbarian, I needed it way more than he did.

193
00:10:29,877 --> 00:10:30,410
Rym: Ah, good times.

194
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,610
Rym: But no, that game is great if you're eight years old or you're a patient father.

195
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:35,363
Rym: Otherwise...

196
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,149
Scott: It's like He-Man is great.

197
00:10:36,392 --> 00:10:36,587
Rym: Yes.

198
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,529
Rym: It is the worst game.

199
00:10:39,315 --> 00:10:39,970
Scott: It is not good.

200
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:44,149
Rym: You know, it's funny because there's another property that's getting a similar sort of...

201
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:45,450
Scott: Everything's getting remaked.

202
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,970
Scott: No one has an original bone in their... No one has an original Fimir in their body.

203
00:10:51,111 --> 00:10:56,868
Rym: It's similar in that it's a foreign country pulling up a license with blessing from the original creator.

204
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,910
Rym: Some Canadians are remaking River City Ransom with official licensing.

205
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,430
Scott: River City Ransom was remade.

206
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,150
Scott: There was a River City Ransom on the GBA DS.

207
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,130
Scott: There was even the Super Dodge Ball, which we had.

208
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:07,710
Rym: You know what I want?

209
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,890
Rym: I just want to play all the other games in that series, but I digress.

210
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:11,449
Scott: Exactly.

211
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,950
Rym: River City Ransom Underground is a modern remake of River City Ransom.

212
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:21,290
Rym: The video for the Kickstarter is kind of annoying because the guy's not that funny.

213
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,670
Scott: Yeah, he's definitely trying hard to be funny and failing.

214
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,250
Rym: But then they showed gameplay and it's like, wow, that is in fact the gameplay I want.

215
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:33,390
Rym: Because while the Scott Pilgrim game is fun, it doesn't quite feel like River City Ransom.

216
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:35,110
Scott: No, it feels like Scott Pilgrim.

217
00:11:35,557 --> 00:11:35,770
Rym: Yeah.

218
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,730
Rym: Also, the characters look a lot older, so we'll see.

219
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:42,830
Rym: Ryan looks like he's got stubble now.

220
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:44,810
Scott: Ryan looks... Oh, those are the old pictures.

221
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:44,874
Scott: Yes.

222
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:46,610
Scott: Ryan looks like Ryan.

223
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,310
Scott: What are you talking about?

224
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,609
Scott: How about Alex?

225
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,270
Scott: How's Alex doing?

226
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:51,790
Rym: He also has stubble.

227
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:52,327
Rym: Okay.

228
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,188
Rym: They both have stubble.

229
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,650
Scott: So, I guess it's more, I don't know.

230
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,490
Scott: Is someone ransomed?

231
00:11:57,658 --> 00:11:58,048
Rym: I don't know.

232
00:11:58,711 --> 00:12:01,310
Rym: I didn't watch the whole video, but I Kickstarted it because whatever.

233
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,890
Scott: Anyway, we should make River City Ransom where the girls save the dudes and it's all girl fights.

234
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,029
Rym: Oh, that would be a good game.

235
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:06,750
Scott: I know, right?

236
00:12:07,032 --> 00:12:07,117
Scott: Yeah.

237
00:12:07,577 --> 00:12:07,728
Rym: Yeah.

238
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:11,710
Rym: As long as it didn't devolve into... It would have to be the exact same kind of game.

239
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,108
Rym: Another idea?

240
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:17,068
Rym: It can't be like the Princess Peach game where she uses the power of emotion to save the day.

241
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:17,770
Scott: Another idea?

242
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,869
Scott: We should make a fighting game.

243
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:26,030
Scott: All the characters are characters from beat 'em up games, so it's everyone from Final Fight, everyone from Streets of Rage, everyone from River City Ransom, Ninja Turtles, right?

244
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:34,790
Scott: Or we should, a lot of these characters are, I think, might be missing from, I know Hagar's on there, but there are some characters missing from Salty Bet.

245
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,030
Rym: You know what we need to make in Salty Bet?

246
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,329
Rym: You know what the number one thing we need to make in Salty Bet now is?

247
00:12:41,075 --> 00:12:41,588
Rym: The femur.

248
00:12:41,981 --> 00:12:42,250
Scott: The femur.

249
00:12:42,337 --> 00:12:42,425
Scott: Sure.

250
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:43,864
Rym: Do it.

251
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:57,508
Rym: So, the auction houses in Diablo, Pay to Win, we didn't talk about them a lot because they're the kind of thing that just angered me and saddened me to the point that this, they're shit.

252
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,270
Rym: If you like it, if you used it, you're a terrible person.

253
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:07,809
Rym: We talked at length about why they were a bad idea, right alongside that Always On DRM, and yeah, they're gone.

254
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,168
Scott: That's, what?

255
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,890
Rym: They are gone as of March 18th, 2014.

256
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:14,449
Scott: Oh, so next year?

257
00:13:14,954 --> 00:13:17,050
Scott: Yes, they are- That's still, that's crazy, right?

258
00:13:17,151 --> 00:13:18,629
Scott: That this is a real story, not a joke?

259
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:23,930
Scott: Yeah, a game- What game ever has had microtransaction bullshit and then removed it?

260
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:24,418
Scott: None.

261
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,370
Scott: None ever.

262
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:37,389
Scott: This is the first one I've ever heard about removing microtransaction nonsense, and Blizzard no less, which is coming out with Hearthstone, the most microtransaction bullshit Pay to Win I've ever splayed in my life.

263
00:13:38,281 --> 00:13:38,490
Scott: Yeah.

264
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,770
Scott: And they're removing that bullshit from Diablo 3, holy crap.

265
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:52,789
Rym: Now, it's interesting because they gave a statement talking about why, and they basically said that it wasn't, like it didn't fit with what they wanted the game to be.

266
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,990
Scott: You notice, this comes after they bought themselves back from Vivendi.

267
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:02,150
Rym: Alright, Vivendi, it's easy to forget.

268
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,310
Rym: It's easy to forget.

269
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:09,009
Rym: There was a time when Penny Arcade and the like would often point to Vivendi as being the source of all evil.

270
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:20,870
Scott: Vivendi owned Activision, which owned Blizzard, and Blizzard has sort of been this company where in some ways it's a good guy like Valve, in some ways not a good guy, but now ever since and Activision was more bad guy, only a little bit good guy.

271
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:27,710
Scott: You know, Activision, Pitfall good, modern stuff not as good, but Activision- Also, most of their old games also not that good.

272
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:34,184
Scott: Buying itself away from Vivendi, so now it's just Activision Blizzard, suddenly a good guy thing happens, it's like,

273
00:14:34,245 --> 00:14:34,487
Scott: "Ohh.".

274
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,349
Rym: Well, keep an eye out because Dell- Hope increasing.

275
00:14:37,471 --> 00:14:39,610
Rym: Notice how Michael Dell is just buying Dell back.

276
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,667
Rym: He's like, "Fuck you guys, I'm going private and I'm going to fix

277
00:14:41,687 --> 00:14:41,909
Rym: Dell.".

278
00:14:42,111 --> 00:14:43,169
Scott: I wonder if he can do that.

279
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:44,647
Rym: I might be able to.

280
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:52,429
Scott: So to quote them- If I was him, I would just concentrate on selling the servers, the 1Us and the 2Us because nobody's making those anymore but him.

281
00:14:53,011 --> 00:15:04,285
Rym: The official statement from them on the Diablo update is, and I quote, "When we initially designed and implemented the auction houses, the drive-in goal was to provide a convenient and secure system for

282
00:15:04,366 --> 00:15:04,710
Rym: trades.".

283
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:05,490
Scott: That's horse shit.

284
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,090
Scott: They could have made secure trades without fucking real money.

285
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:26,849
Rym: Yep, but as we've mentioned on different occasions, it became increasingly clear that despite the benefits of the auction house system and the fact that many players around the world use it, it ultimately undermines Diablo's core game play, colon, kill monsters, and get cool loot.

286
00:15:27,131 --> 00:15:28,589
Scott: Of course it undermines that.

287
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:33,369
Rym: Uh, yeah, but it didn't really undermine it.

288
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:36,109
Rym: It undermined the grind part of it.

289
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,950
Scott: That's what Diablo's core- You could pay to skip grind.

290
00:15:38,231 --> 00:15:38,728
Scott: That's what that is.

291
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:42,069
Scott: Kill monsters, get loot, equals grinding.

292
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,370
Scott: Diablo's core game play is grinding.

293
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,410
Rym: But who likes grinding?

294
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,450
Rym: Well, we know who likes grinding.

295
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,329
Scott: People who play Diablo more than once.

296
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:56,264
Scott: See, when I play Diablo, I play it and I just go from the beginning to the end and I just try to get to the end.

297
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:57,630
Rym: One, one, one, one.

298
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:58,268
Rym: Two, two, one.

299
00:15:58,451 --> 00:15:58,868
Rym: One, one, one.

300
00:15:59,131 --> 00:16:00,570
Rym: Yes, get to the end, beat Diablo.

301
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,830
Scott: Good, I'm done, right?

302
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:12,370
Scott: If you're the kind of person who plays Diablo where you go into hell and you sit there killing hellions and things in hell for a long time hoping they drop mad loots, yeah.

303
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,810
Rym: I did that once in one game in recent history.

304
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:17,263
Scott: Which is?

305
00:16:18,032 --> 00:16:20,130
Rym: The first Castlevania on the DS.

306
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:25,850
Rym: Because I had the second best- I had basically the third best axe in the game.

307
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:34,770
Rym: The first best axe you can only get if you take the second best axe and kill, I think, death drops it and then you can have this crazy fucking axe.

308
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:41,930
Rym: So the only way to get the second best axe in the game, it dropped from this one monster.

309
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:51,446
Rym: So I was walking around and I found a screen that had that monster on it and I thought for a second and I was like I have to do it and I just walked back and forth for like a half hour until he finally dropped it.

310
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,450
Scott: You know, I was playing Super Metroid, which I streamed.

311
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,510
Scott: By the way, I have this Elgato streaming device.

312
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:00,870
Rym: Oh, where Geeknight streaming shit is coming to you guys.

313
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,530
Scott: So I'm just streaming like random games I'm playing, whatever.

314
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:08,869
Rym: Thing is, I want to do the same thing, but it'd be a pain in the ass to borrow scots.

315
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,269
Rym: I feel like I might just have to buy my own.

316
00:17:10,991 --> 00:17:16,970
Scott: Anyway, so I was just playing Super Metroid and it's like I'd find a secret and sometimes I'd be like fuck that secret.

317
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:17,568
Scott: I don't need that.

318
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,609
Scott: It's probably just missiles.

319
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,349
Scott: And sometimes it'd be like I'm getting that secret.

320
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,410
Scott: Look how secret that is.

321
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,269
Scott: You know that's something good.

322
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:24,650
Scott: You know that's like super missiles.

323
00:17:25,632 --> 00:17:27,089
Scott: So at least super missiles.

324
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:32,075
Scott: So I would go for it and some of them would be hard to get and basically I was trying to get it's like I could.

325
00:17:32,095 --> 00:17:35,428
Scott: just sometimes I was like I'll just go get the space jump and come back.

326
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,107
Scott: It'll be way easy.

327
00:17:36,852 --> 00:17:39,030
Scott: But sometimes I was like I want it now.

328
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:44,132
Scott: I'm using the wall jump, but I want it now and I basically got these crazy hard to get secrets.

329
00:17:44,152 --> 00:17:46,970
Scott: that would have been a piece of cake if I had the space jump screw attack.

330
00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:49,863
Scott: But because I only had wall jump, I basically had.

331
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:55,710
Scott: it was like sitting there for like at least 15 minutes failing at wall jumping with the shitty Wii classic controller.

332
00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:07,910
Rym: What's funny is that actually of all games it was the Zelda Minish Cap game that sort of killed my desire to get secrets in most games because that game had all these cool secrets to get, but what you actually got was nothing.

333
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:09,890
Scott: See in Super Metroid you get something.

334
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,050
Rym: Yeah, Super Metroid you get something.

335
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:22,906
Scott: Well, there's that one secret where you have to run really fast and do the duck, the crouch, you know, dash super jump thing into this very narrow spot to go up into a missile and it's like hell.

336
00:18:22,946 --> 00:18:23,028
Scott: no.

337
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,290
Rym: I can do with five fewer missiles.

338
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,371
Scott: Yeah, I'm not going for 100%.

339
00:18:27,371 --> 00:18:29,509
Scott: I'm going for defeat the mother brain.

340
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:36,430
Rym: But you know, we have a lot to say about this, but I've slashed shot of all places.

341
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:48,425
Rym: The top comment, the first comment, as far as I can tell, quote, I always thought auction house is what may have Diablo three relevant and rewarding since the gameplay focuses on being grindy.

342
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,130
Rym: Now that you can no longer exchange gear for actual money, what's the point?

343
00:18:52,753 --> 00:18:54,628
Rym: The game itself isn't fun enough to play.

344
00:18:56,891 --> 00:19:01,710
Rym: And then people basically say everything that we were going to say, but we'll say it anyway.

345
00:19:02,052 --> 00:19:04,649
Rym: So one, are they going to get rid of the DRM?

346
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,050
Scott: That's a good point.

347
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:12,029
Scott: The only reason they had this sort of always online, which is the bigger complaint than the auction house by most people, but not us.

348
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:19,690
Scott: Well, I mean, not that we didn't complain about that, but it was sort of the second worst thing about Diablo three was because of the money auction house.

349
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:23,430
Scott: If you don't have the money auction house, why do you need the always online bullshit?

350
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:24,388
Rym: Well we know why.

351
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,429
Scott: The console version, which isn't always online.

352
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:39,390
Rym: Because their ulterior motive was they didn't want people cheating because if some asshole out there cheats at his effectively single player game and gets loot that he doesn't quote deserve, that ruins my gameplay experience somehow.

353
00:19:40,032 --> 00:19:40,122
Scott: Sure.

354
00:19:40,851 --> 00:19:43,969
Scott: Also, too many people watch kawaii bebop, it's not a good show anymore.

355
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:50,390
Rym: Yeah, as that guy at Anime Boston so eloquently tried to describe to his friend and didn't realize my camera was just next to him recording.

356
00:19:51,711 --> 00:19:54,546
Rym: But there's a statement here also on slash shot.

357
00:19:54,587 --> 00:19:55,230
Rym: that is choice.

358
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,349
Rym: This is my second favorite comment of the year.

359
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,590
Rym: And this guy does not appear to be joking.

360
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,530
Scott: What's your first favorite comment of the year?

361
00:20:03,174 --> 00:20:04,209
Rym: I'll have to go look it up again.

362
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,029
Rym: It was, I'll find it.

363
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:06,808
Rym: It was something great.

364
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:07,330
Rym: Okay.

365
00:20:07,677 --> 00:20:08,009
Rym: I tweeted.

366
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:11,990
Rym: I just have to go find it again because I have to say it exactly or it loses its impact.

367
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:19,650
Rym: The lack of an auction house is what made D2 and Borderlands such a success.

368
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:27,850
Rym: Precisely that you had to grind endlessly to perhaps get good stuff gave people a sense of achievement.

369
00:20:28,431 --> 00:20:32,750
Rym: When all anyone needed to do was flip out the credit card, that disappeared.

370
00:20:34,112 --> 00:20:35,150
Rym: Plus five insightful.

371
00:20:36,173 --> 00:20:37,830
Rym: What the fuck, dude?

372
00:20:38,896 --> 00:20:39,088
Rym: Really?

373
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:39,905
Scott: Yes.

374
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,590
Scott: You achieve something by wasting your goddamn time.

375
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,070
Scott: Well, I mean, it is true, right?

376
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,710
Scott: It's a, it is completely correct.

377
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,770
Scott: People do get this sense of achievement, right?

378
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:53,790
Scott: It's these games reward people for spending time, right?

379
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,002
Scott: Look at like net runner or counter strike the games that we like.

380
00:20:57,886 --> 00:21:00,289
Scott: these games, it doesn't matter how much time you spend.

381
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,310
Scott: They punish you if you're not any good.

382
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:07,105
Scott: And if you continue to not be good, there's people who've been playing net runner as long as me.

383
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,028
Scott: There's a guy I know.

384
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:08,969
Scott: Nice guy.

385
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:09,466
Scott: Great guy.

386
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:11,529
Scott: He was at the first tournament I was at.

387
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,830
Scott: Susan playing as long as me and he shows up the tournaments.

388
00:21:15,131 --> 00:21:17,589
Scott: He still places even worse than me.

389
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:20,790
Scott: Like I'm usually middle of the pack, even though I just came in second for the first time.

390
00:21:20,953 --> 00:21:21,186
Scott: Go me.

391
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,310
Scott: I could have won, but yeah.

392
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:24,930
Scott: Um, but he's always like dead last.

393
00:21:25,011 --> 00:21:26,028
Scott: He just, he's just not good.

394
00:21:26,612 --> 00:21:29,370
Scott: And he's just punished for sucking over and over again.

395
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,810
Scott: He doesn't get any sense of achievement.

396
00:21:30,895 --> 00:21:30,981
Scott: Why?

397
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,290
Scott: Because he hasn't achieved anything.

398
00:21:32,971 --> 00:21:41,229
Scott: A game like Borderlands or an RPG or Diablo or a border, you know, whatever these games, you don't have to be good.

399
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,929
Scott: You just have to spend time.

400
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:52,907
Scott: The more time you spend and they will reward you, you automatically will succeed and get rewards and make it feel like you've achieved something simply because you spent time.

401
00:21:53,008 --> 00:21:55,890
Scott: Farmville doesn't matter if you've actually achieved anything.

402
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:07,090
Scott: And this is why these games, if you want to make money, that's the kind of game you should make because people of any skill level will enjoy that shit because they'll feel like they've achieved something when they haven't.

403
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:17,590
Scott: If you make a game that only achievers, real achievers, can feel like they've achieved something at, only hardcore people who are good at shit are gonna like that game.

404
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,710
Scott: Now it's a little more subtle than that.

405
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:22,929
Scott: You know how many people stop playing Netrunner because like, fuck, I just got my ass handed to me constantly.

406
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:23,729
Scott: Fuck this shit.

407
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,310
Scott: Or damn, Counter-Strike sucks.

408
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,750
Scott: I just die instantly all the time.

409
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,330
Scott: What the fuck?

410
00:22:27,411 --> 00:22:28,530
Rym: It's a little more nuanced than that.

411
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:34,728
Rym: Because one, you know, I'm playing through Fire Emblem just to beat it so I can review it fully, liking it less and less the longer I play it.

412
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:42,748
Rym: But it is hard as a human to not feel that sense of achievement when you level your fucking dude up in a thing.

413
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,710
Rym: That is, that is, there is a psychological, there is a powerful desire.

414
00:22:46,831 --> 00:22:47,568
Scott: It works on me.

415
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:51,849
Rym: I mean, Fire Emblem, like I found myself, I was like, well, I haven't really used that character yet.

416
00:22:52,151 --> 00:22:53,530
Rym: Maybe I should power level her.

417
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,245
Rym: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

418
00:22:56,771 --> 00:23:04,990
Rym: But, dude, games like Counter-Strike and Netrunner, they don't reward time directly, but they reward it as a secondary effect.

419
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,450
Scott: Yes, practice, obviously.

420
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,808
Rym: They reward practice, which means you're spending time.

421
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:14,552
Scott: But anything, you know, if you want skills, even if you're a genius, even if you are a fitness.

422
00:23:14,632 --> 00:23:19,930
Scott: in all of these, you know, fundamental skills, if you play a new game, you still need practice.

423
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:32,170
Scott: You could take a great athlete, and if they've never played this new sport called suckball, right, they need to practice these specific skills of that sport, which takes time, but the time in and of itself is not enough.

424
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,630
Scott: The time has to be well spent on practicing specific things.

425
00:23:36,031 --> 00:23:38,430
Rym: They might just have natural talent and a knack.

426
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:43,170
Scott: You have to be, and you have, that practice has to be successful practice.

427
00:23:43,311 --> 00:23:50,690
Scott: You actually have to, you know, do the right things the right way, and then when you go to play the actual game, you have to carry those things over.

428
00:23:50,771 --> 00:23:51,890
Scott: It's not easy to do.

429
00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:52,830
Scott: It's not guaranteed.

430
00:23:53,312 --> 00:24:06,830
Scott: The games I'm talking about, like, you know, Borderlands, it's if you spend time, unless you are really, really, really dumb, time spent guarantees success, regardless of practicing or skill or anything like that.

431
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:10,713
Rym: Okay, so I found my best internet comment of 2013.

432
00:24:10,713 --> 00:24:12,910
Rym: It's hard to really get it across, because everything's spelled wrong.

433
00:24:13,591 --> 00:24:19,625
Rym: So you're, and this was in response to some political thing where the south as a unit was brought up.

434
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,635
Rym: You're spelled wrong, right.

435
00:24:22,735 --> 00:24:31,006
Rym: sad to say comma, Yankee empire in caps is 10 root of all evil period caps secede.

436
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:37,710
Rym: Okay, that comment is my favorite comment of the entire year.

437
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:42,190
Rym: I have not seen anything that gave me as much joy as reading that comment.

438
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:44,670
Scott: Okay, whatever.

439
00:24:45,011 --> 00:24:52,467
Rym: But with this auction house thing, there are a lot of people who do feel slighted or wrong somehow.

440
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:57,630
Scott: If I was a dumb ass and spend money on it, no one's complaining about that.

441
00:24:59,032 --> 00:25:09,290
Rym: The people who get mad, if someone else cheats, I make finger quotes here by not grinding to get an item in a single player game.

442
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:15,569
Rym: They feel like because that person didn't put forth their effort, if he just, Oh, he just downloaded that Evie train Pokemon.

443
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:16,348
Rym: He just hacked it.

444
00:25:16,671 --> 00:25:19,350
Rym: It is not worth the value of mine.

445
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:23,710
Rym: And in fact, he is invalidated my work and I feel bad about wasting my time now.

446
00:25:24,331 --> 00:25:31,650
Scott: Well, I mean, if there was a competition, right where I had to fight some guy and it wasn't a level playing field, right.

447
00:25:32,132 --> 00:25:35,928
Scott: And some other guy has a thing I don't have, regardless of how he got it.

448
00:25:36,694 --> 00:25:37,769
Scott: I'm fucking this.

449
00:25:37,978 --> 00:25:38,208
Rym: Yup.

450
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:43,290
Scott: But again, Diablo isn't directly competing at the penny arcade comic.

451
00:25:43,693 --> 00:25:45,629
Scott: The penny arcade has already commented on this.

452
00:25:46,032 --> 00:25:46,590
Scott: Who's cheating?

453
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,689
Rym: Who's who is the cheated party here?

454
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:49,188
Scott: Satan?

455
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:50,187
Scott: Fuck him.

456
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:51,602
Scott: Right?

457
00:25:52,911 --> 00:25:53,889
Scott: Just linked to that penny arcade.

458
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:58,977
Scott: That says everything we have to say in so few words and pictures, which are a million words.

459
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:05,570
Rym: But that slash shot comment is that guy, the people who actually believe this are real and get voted plus five insightful on slash shot.

460
00:26:05,911 --> 00:26:06,309
Scott: Of course.

461
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,330
Rym: So we'll see what happens.

462
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,490
Rym: I still haven't even bothered.

463
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:13,370
Scott: People who think how we give up sucks when it gets popular or plus five insightful.

464
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,330
Rym: I haven't even bothered playing Diablo three.

465
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:22,590
Scott: But I'm you know what, when it gets cheap, you know, I like I buy like a torch lighter at Diablo just to play through and kill Satan just once.

466
00:26:23,112 --> 00:26:25,490
Scott: If it's if it's not 50 bucks, you know, why not?

467
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,084
Scott: Ten bucks if I got nothing else to do and all the other games are done now.

468
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:32,370
Scott: They said they gave this resident and beat torchlight to you publicly.

469
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,656
Rym: They basically said they want to.

470
00:26:33,756 --> 00:26:36,350
Rym: you know, they're changing the experience for a reason.

471
00:26:37,071 --> 00:26:39,842
Rym: They gave a reason and they have a secondary reason of.

472
00:26:40,143 --> 00:26:47,596
Rym: we feel that this move, along with the loot 2.0 system being developed with Reaper of Souls will result in a more rewarding experience for those.

473
00:26:47,616 --> 00:26:48,630
Scott: give me an expansion.

474
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:49,585
Rym: Yes.

475
00:26:50,271 --> 00:26:51,250
Rym: Oh, 2.0.

476
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:57,810
Scott: So then I think I will get a game of year edition that includes all expansions and play through once and kill Satan.

477
00:26:58,431 --> 00:27:05,530
Rym: But I say I somehow don't think that they removed the auction house system to make a better experience for the players.

478
00:27:06,951 --> 00:27:11,350
Rym: I think they removed it because it wasn't making the money they hoped it would make.

479
00:27:12,171 --> 00:27:13,569
Rym: Maybe that is my guess.

480
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:22,001
Rym: That is the the unstated reason because it seems it seems odd to me that they would actually remove it for any reason other than it wasn't making money.

481
00:27:22,121 --> 00:27:24,829
Rym: unless it is the we are free of a Vendi.

482
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,249
Rym: Let's actually do good.

483
00:27:26,594 --> 00:27:27,026
Scott: It could be.

484
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,469
Rym: I give it a fifty fifty shot either way.

485
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:38,310
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

486
00:27:38,711 --> 00:27:41,521
Rym: So I might have to stop fucking playing Counter-Strike.

487
00:27:41,541 --> 00:27:47,650
Rym: go now because there's issues like, you know, the draws his draw distance issue, which Scott and I were talking about.

488
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:48,390
Rym: I learned some more.

489
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,649
Rym: There's two factors going on.

490
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,290
Rym: And I found a widget.

491
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:50,850
Rym: I can twiddle.

492
00:27:51,431 --> 00:27:53,090
Rym: Oh, I'm going to play around with some widgets.

493
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:53,570
Rym: Yeah.

494
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,190
Scott: And that sounds like bullshit to me, though.

495
00:27:55,452 --> 00:27:55,796
Rym: I'm going to.

496
00:27:55,816 --> 00:27:56,990
Rym: I'm going to play around with some with both.

497
00:27:57,331 --> 00:27:58,389
Rym: There's two pieces of bullshit.

498
00:27:58,772 --> 00:28:00,469
Rym: One, I couldn't see into those fucking windows.

499
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,150
Scott: Right.

500
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,830
Rym: And now that I have a video card, that's good.

501
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:03,305
Rym: I can.

502
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:12,030
Rym: But two, if if there's a barrel on a map and you get far enough away from it and your draw distance recedes, the barrel disappears.

503
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,485
Rym: But player objects don't.

504
00:28:14,051 --> 00:28:15,609
Rym: So you can see through the barrel.

505
00:28:15,871 --> 00:28:17,389
Scott: Well, only if you're zoomed way in.

506
00:28:17,694 --> 00:28:17,868
Rym: Yes.

507
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:25,324
Rym: And the thing is, this also wouldn't have been noticeable except they brought back a lot of those gigantic goddamn maps or at least there are.

508
00:28:25,545 --> 00:28:28,589
Scott: at least there are certain spots on the map where you can see really far.

509
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:34,390
Rym: I think it's really the the those rush maps, the small maps that they do for, you know, they all the different modes there.

510
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,127
Rym: You don't play that much.

511
00:28:35,771 --> 00:28:44,950
Rym: They have a rapid fire mode of gameplay where imagine a normal Counter-Strike match twice as fast on a smaller map like you start closer.

512
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:45,790
Rym: You fight right away.

513
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,890
Rym: There's a very simple objective.

514
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,990
Scott: And those matches hold down the button at spawn.

515
00:28:50,234 --> 00:28:50,930
Rym: Those maps.

516
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:51,968
Rym: Not quite an F.Y.

517
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:52,610
Rym: Icy world.

518
00:28:52,876 --> 00:28:53,003
Rym: OK.

519
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:57,090
Rym: Those maps are actually, for whatever reason, huge world.

520
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:57,928
Rym: Icy world.

521
00:28:58,376 --> 00:28:59,350
Rym: I could play some Icy World.

522
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,330
Scott: I'm going to play Icy World now.

523
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:01,330
Rym: Oh my God.

524
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,290
Rym: I just want to play some Counter-Strike.

525
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:11,689
Rym: But yeah, this scandal proves that Valve has no idea what they're doing and they're ruining the competitive community for Counter-Strike.

526
00:29:14,118 --> 00:29:14,929
Rym: You got a thing of the day.

527
00:29:15,192 --> 00:29:15,341
Scott: I do.

528
00:29:16,151 --> 00:29:16,868
Scott: So the most.

529
00:29:17,535 --> 00:29:18,230
Rym: Top comment on YouTube.

530
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,568
Rym: I quit CSGO because of this.

531
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:20,021
Scott: Sure.

532
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:26,771
Scott: The most remixed, listened and loved video game music of all time is, of course, Mega Man 2.

533
00:29:26,771 --> 00:29:30,209
Scott: Everyone knows that there's been a zillion Mega Man 2 remixes.

534
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:36,289
Scott: To use one as the thing of day would be a sin to, you know, put it above all the other ones that are also great.

535
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:37,970
Rym: I've got like 60 on my hard drive.

536
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:38,668
Scott: I know, right?

537
00:29:39,651 --> 00:29:41,370
Scott: Here's one, though, that is unique.

538
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:49,350
Scott: I won't say it's the better of all Mega Man remixes, but the Mega Man 2 Lullaby album.

539
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:53,029
Scott: Lullaby renditions of all Mega Man 2 musics.

540
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,769
Rym: That's kind of cool.

541
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,590
Scott: Track one, opening theme.

542
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:00,747
Scott: Two, Air Man, Bubble Man, Quick Man, Flash Man, Crash Man, Wood Man, Heat Man, Wily Stage, end theme.

543
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:05,050
Rym: In the meta moment, we are going to be at MAGFest.

544
00:30:06,452 --> 00:30:07,007
Rym: Be there.

545
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:08,989
Rym: Machine supremacy.

546
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:14,790
Rym: We did a panel at PAXOS and another one at PAX Prime at Shits on YouTube.

547
00:30:15,891 --> 00:30:17,350
Rym: Our book club book is still Stazzyland.

548
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,489
Rym: Scott has not read it.

549
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:19,722
Scott: I have not read even one word.

550
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,087
Rym: You should read it.

551
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,590
Rym: It's kind of relevant to the NSA stuff going on.

552
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,349
Rym: I've already picked my next two book club books.

553
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:27,945
Rym: So, uh...

554
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:29,669
Scott: I get to pick next, so you have to wait.

555
00:30:30,111 --> 00:30:30,628
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

556
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:34,530
Rym: I'll read my book so quick, just so I can get back to the next book I'm picking.

557
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:34,899
Rym: Alright.

558
00:30:35,811 --> 00:30:38,387
Rym: You're not going to like one of the next books.

559
00:30:38,428 --> 00:30:38,810
Rym: I'm picking.

560
00:30:39,993 --> 00:30:41,830
Scott: The Cup Count of Monte Cristo long edition?

561
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:43,590
Rym: Nah, because I don't need to read that again yet.

562
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,769
Scott: War and Peace long edition?

563
00:30:44,871 --> 00:30:45,789
Rym: I'm not going to read that shit.

564
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:48,590
Rym: It's no great expectations.

565
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:51,089
Scott: And yeah.

566
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,770
Scott: Complete works of some poet long edition.

567
00:30:54,472 --> 00:30:58,030
Rym: I do have the complete works of Poe, but don't really need to read all those.

568
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:58,603
Rym: A lot of her just...

569
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:04,809
Scott: Well, you know if you go to the library, they always have those like, the old books are always like, complete works of like, I don't know.

570
00:31:05,514 --> 00:31:05,810
Rym: Shakespeare.

571
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:06,769
Scott: Someone.

572
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:07,310
Scott: I don't know.

573
00:31:07,794 --> 00:31:07,948
Rym: Yeah.

574
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:08,220
Rym: Anyway.

575
00:31:08,817 --> 00:31:09,010
Rym: Anyway.

576
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:10,704
Rym: So, yeah.

577
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,249
Rym: Salty bet.

578
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:13,424
Scott: Salty bet?

579
00:31:13,631 --> 00:31:14,289
Rym: Salty bet.

580
00:31:14,771 --> 00:31:17,810
Scott: So, salty bet, we're a little bit late to the party on salty bet.

581
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,189
Scott: It's been around for a little bit.

582
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:22,470
Rym: Yet we seem to be ahead of the party because no one I talk to has ever heard of this thing.

583
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:22,708
Rym: Right.

584
00:31:22,771 --> 00:31:23,223
Scott: Well, it's weird.

585
00:31:24,196 --> 00:31:25,067
Scott: I didn't know about it.

586
00:31:25,391 --> 00:31:25,665
Scott: At all.

587
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:29,470
Scott: Suddenly, I see like a news story about it and I'm like, what is this?

588
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,430
Scott: So I discover it because I read a lot of internets.

589
00:31:32,055 --> 00:31:36,730
Rym: But apparently... Oh shit, Queen Beryl versus the most ghetto Gohan I've ever seen.

590
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:37,505
Scott: Never bet DBZ.

591
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:40,110
Rym: Oh, look at this Gohan, oh my god.

592
00:31:41,111 --> 00:31:41,930
Scott: Do not bet that.

593
00:31:43,231 --> 00:31:43,764
Rym: Gohan Zeta.

594
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:46,090
Rym: Yeah, Queen Beryl's winning the fuck out of this.

595
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,650
Scott: Yeah, it's Sailor Moon, your favorite, right?

596
00:31:47,951 --> 00:31:48,850
Rym: Yeah, always bet SM.

597
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:51,950
Scott: Actually, Sailor Uranus is freaking the craziest powerful.

598
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:56,888
Scott: I'm glad I learned about Sailor Moon from you so I know to bet on outer-senshi and not inner-senshi.

599
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:01,970
Rym: Yeah, well Sailor Uranus is, Sailor Saturn is technically more powerful.

600
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:06,010
Scott: I haven't seen Sailor Saturn fight yet, but Sailor Uranus also almost won a tournament.

601
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,709
Rym: You know what Sailor Saturn's power is in the show?

602
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,330
Rym: End all life in the universe.

603
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:11,088
Scott: Nice.

604
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:11,650
Scott: Bam.

605
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:12,649
Rym: That's her power.

606
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,948
Scott: Queen Beryl, why aren't you doing anything against that DBZ?

607
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,570
Rym: Uh oh, potato, potato.

608
00:32:17,411 --> 00:32:18,870
Scott: Okay, so the deal with salty bet.

609
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:29,850
Scott: There's a fighting game engine out there called Mugen and what Mugen is, it's sort of an open source free fighting game engine thing where just anyone can make characters for it.

610
00:32:30,472 --> 00:32:32,890
Scott: So it's like the open fighting game.

611
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,270
Scott: You want to make a fighting game character?

612
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:37,630
Scott: Make it and they'll fight and pretty much characters can do anything.

613
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:38,970
Scott: You can make any kind of character.

614
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:42,790
Scott: Any mechanic that's ever been in a fighting game is in there, is possible to do.

615
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:43,185
Scott: There's a lot.

616
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,408
Scott: Like power up meters.

617
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:46,150
Rym: How many buttons does your character have?

618
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:46,890
Rym: Do they have beams?

619
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:50,010
Scott: Fatalities, fatalities, you know, everything.

620
00:32:52,230 --> 00:33:07,330
Scott: So what this guy did, Salty, is he took Mugen, he set it up and he installed and downloaded from the internet every character he could find, thousands, literally thousands of characters from every property, licensed property you can imagine, right?

621
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:10,629
Scott: Some of them, you don't even know what the fuck they're from, but a lot of them are from animes.

622
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:19,090
Scott: Like here we got a Sailor Moon fighting a DBZ is a lot of anime characters, fighting game characters, video game characters, you know, cartoon characters.

623
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:23,329
Scott: I saw some Finn and Jake, I saw some Bender, I saw all kinds of stuff, right?

624
00:33:25,033 --> 00:33:26,423
Scott: And he set it up to stream, right?

625
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,710
Scott: These characters, this game playing.

626
00:33:31,471 --> 00:33:32,370
Scott: And what does it stream?

627
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:35,630
Scott: It streams the AI fighting itself, random versus random.

628
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:40,789
Scott: It picks two characters and they fight on shitty AI versus shitty AI and he streams it on Twitch.

629
00:33:41,011 --> 00:33:45,490
Rym: So case in point right now, it's Gohan Zeta versus Queen Beryl from Sailor Moon.

630
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,030
Scott: Gohan Zeta won, fuck that shit.

631
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,570
Rym: Well Beryl was pretty potato.

632
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,530
Scott: Even though her animation was so good, whoever drew that one.

633
00:33:53,212 --> 00:33:55,245
Rym: All the comments are WTF, WTF, WTF.

634
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:56,298
Scott: Yeah.

635
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:03,509
Scott: So you watch this and if you sign in, they give you like 300 something salty bucks that you can bet.

636
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:08,270
Scott: So you bet on which side you think is gonna win at the beginning of the match, then they fight.

637
00:34:08,891 --> 00:34:11,070
Scott: If you win, you get money.

638
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:15,830
Scott: And the way they do the money is they take all of the losing players' bets.

639
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:18,789
Scott: So anyone who bet, is that Rorschach versus Mega Vegeta?

640
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,790
Rym: The Vegeta's doing that Mexibeam Twitch.

641
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,630
Scott: I wonder what Rorschach's gonna do from Watchmen.

642
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:28,349
Scott: I'm gonna bet on... Look at this, Watchmen versus DBZ.

643
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,447
Scott: Have you ever heard of something so crazy?

644
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,210
Rym: I'm betting on Mega Vegeta.

645
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:34,350
Scott: Whoever put that combination together in their wildest dreams?

646
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:35,887
Rym: Always bet flickering DBZ.

647
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:37,049
Scott: I know, right?

648
00:34:38,014 --> 00:34:39,069
Scott: Yeah, Rorschach probably sucks.

649
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:49,389
Scott: So let's say that all the people who... Let's say Rorschach wins this fight and all the people combined who bet on Mega Vegeta bet a million dollars combined.

650
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:55,350
Scott: And let's say I bet 1,000 on Rorschach and the total bet on Rorschach was 500,000.

651
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,070
Rym: Rorschach's turtle.

652
00:34:56,391 --> 00:34:57,589
Rym: I got beat like a girl.

653
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:58,087
Scott: Right.

654
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,836
Scott: So 500,000 divided by my 1,000 is one 500th.

655
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,245
Scott: So if Rorschach...

656
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:05,170
Rym: You win proportionally.

657
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,790
Rym: It's like an old school bookie in a movie.

658
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:11,245
Scott: Yes, you would divide the DBZ losing money into 500 pieces and I would get one of those pieces.

659
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:16,090
Scott: Everyone gets a sized piece in proportion to how much they bet on the winner.

660
00:35:16,171 --> 00:35:17,330
Scott: So the more you bet, the more you win.

661
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,649
Scott: If you lose, you just lose what you bet.

662
00:35:19,511 --> 00:35:22,770
Scott: And if you lose all your money, you go into the mines and you basically get like 10 bucks?

663
00:35:23,193 --> 00:35:24,089
Scott: I've never been in the mines.

664
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,490
Rym: I have also never been in the mines.

665
00:35:28,231 --> 00:35:28,706
Scott: Rorschach won.

666
00:35:29,111 --> 00:35:29,422
Rym: Yeah, he did.

667
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:30,129
Scott: And he took...

668
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,230
Rym: Oh, and the owl came and picked him up.

669
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,049
Scott: I know, that was pretty cool.

670
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:32,608
Scott: I like that.

671
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:33,246
Scott: Yeah.

672
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,310
Rym: Come on, MexiBeam.

673
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,307
Scott: Never bet DBZ.

674
00:35:35,651 --> 00:35:36,169
Rym: I need that beam.

675
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:40,750
Scott: The thing about Saltybed that makes it great is not really just the betting part.

676
00:35:41,153 --> 00:35:42,870
Scott: It's the community part, right?

677
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:47,890
Scott: On the right side of this thing, there is a chat room, a Twitch chat room where everyone's chatting.

678
00:35:48,532 --> 00:35:49,628
Rym: And it's just flying by.

679
00:35:50,011 --> 00:35:56,430
Scott: It's a ton of crazy chat, even when the popular... Right now there's 557 Saltybedders, but usually there's more or less.

680
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:00,370
Scott: During the tournaments, they have... Sometimes they'll have tournaments, Shaker Classic.

681
00:36:01,797 --> 00:36:02,909
Scott: And then there's tons of people then.

682
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:06,869
Scott: But during the non-tournament time, it goes up and down with time of day.

683
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:08,650
Scott: Chats are crazy.

684
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:15,048
Scott: And there's a bunch of basically in-jokes and culture of this particular chat room.

685
00:36:15,068 --> 00:36:19,050
Scott: that is so internet, I like it a lot.

686
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:19,669
Rym: Here's the deal.

687
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:21,130
Rym: Think about what we've just told you.

688
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:32,950
Rym: What this is, in a nutshell, is a place for a community of people to gather and watch AIs fight each other with random properties, and it's just off the wall.

689
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,390
Rym: Simultaneously, the community support is limited too.

690
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:41,909
Rym: The only interaction you get, other than betting, is this little scrolling chat to the right of the screen.

691
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:48,066
Rym: This thing, because of all the things it combined, became a cool kids on the internet thing right away.

692
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:55,910
Rym: And as a result, it proves everything we've said about the internet and culture for the last seven or eight years of GeekNights.

693
00:36:56,731 --> 00:37:08,789
Rym: It formed its own culture in a matter of weeks, distinct from all other internet cultures, with its own references, its own self-references, its own community, its own celebrities, its own lexicon.

694
00:37:09,412 --> 00:37:10,970
Rym: It took weeks for that shit to come together.

695
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:14,730
Rym: And it's continuing to evolve rapidly.

696
00:37:14,871 --> 00:37:17,310
Scott: Let's talk about some of the cool things that happen in Salty Vet.

697
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,850
Scott: So number one, they're always playing music, right?

698
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:22,470
Scott: You can hear the sound effects in the game, but there's basically a soundtrack.

699
00:37:23,792 --> 00:37:26,310
Rym: It's sort of like background nerdy music.

700
00:37:26,931 --> 00:37:31,628
Scott: The guy has really good taste in music, you hear a lot of Samurai Champloo soundtrack going on in there.

701
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,030
Rym: A lot of Sandstorm, I heard.

702
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:36,908
Scott: Yeah, one of the jokes is, anytime someone asks, "What song is

703
00:37:36,949 --> 00:37:37,130
Scott: this?"

704
00:37:37,331 --> 00:37:38,864
Scott: Everyone just says, "Daru De

705
00:37:38,904 --> 00:37:39,449
Scott: Sandstorm.".

706
00:37:39,611 --> 00:37:39,962
Scott: "Daru De

707
00:37:39,982 --> 00:37:40,230
Scott: Sandstorm.".

708
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:44,530
Rym: From what I can gather, at one point, already the lore of this thing is lost.

709
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:49,430
Rym: I can't seem to find a reference to where it started, but I think Sandstorm played once.

710
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:54,410
Scott: Yeah, whenever a Shaker classic starts, he actually does play Daru De Sandstorm.

711
00:37:54,992 --> 00:37:59,669
Scott: And you know, in fighting games, there's always the map, like the screen, like the arena of where they're playing.

712
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,775
Scott: So it's random.

713
00:38:01,855 --> 00:38:06,549
Scott: during the regular times, during the Shaker classic, they actually have a Shaker classic.

714
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,630
Rym: You know, shitty Eris or waifu with a, ugh.

715
00:38:10,112 --> 00:38:10,967
Scott: Probably waifu.

716
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:13,570
Rym: Ah, I'm gonna dream on Eris.

717
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,510
Scott: Ikisan, I'll take Ikisan.

718
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,529
Rym: I'm dreaming on Eris.

719
00:38:16,751 --> 00:38:17,389
Scott: Yeah, the dream.

720
00:38:17,531 --> 00:38:21,010
Scott: If you bet on the character who no one's betting on, that's called the dream.

721
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:22,822
Scott: And it's like, "Dreams,

722
00:38:22,903 --> 00:38:23,449
Scott: dreams!".

723
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:28,550
Scott: 'Cause if you win, you're gonna get mad rich, 'cause you bet on the high odds, like betting on the shitty horse and the Kentucky Derby.

724
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:33,056
Rym: Okay, wow, so someone's explaining to someone else in the chat right now, what people keep saying

725
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:33,468
Rym: "Mexi.".

726
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:34,042
Rym: They're like, "What's

727
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:34,350
Rym: that?".

728
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,650
Rym: And they're actually explaining it legit.

729
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:36,808
Rym: So here's the deal.

730
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:41,870
Rym: With Mugen, as we said, anyone can make any character.

731
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,850
Scott: So apparently, people, particularly in Brazil.

732
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:45,669
Rym: And Mexico.

733
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:50,190
Scott: Mostly Brazil, made a bunch of characters, and those characters speak in Portuguese.

734
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:54,949
Scott: You'll have like a Gohan show up, and he'll speak Portuguese, like, for his taunts and whatever.

735
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,997
Scott: So people are like, "Mexi, Mexi,".

736
00:38:57,037 --> 00:38:59,630
Scott: you know, it's not Mexican, but they call it Mexican.

737
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:00,869
Scott: Even though it's not.

738
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:04,364
Scott: And then, these characters tend to have like these beams.

739
00:39:04,424 --> 00:39:05,690
Scott: they shoot a lot, you know?

740
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:13,550
Rym: Well these characters are usually made, but you know, look, in Central and South America, things like Dragon Ball and robot shows are ridiculously popular.

741
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:18,330
Rym: So the kids down there are also really into video games and fighting games.

742
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:29,450
Rym: So there's a lot of communities that will make characters for Mugen, and they make their favorite characters, and they make them ridiculously overpowered, because that's what you do when you're 14.

743
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:42,190
Rym: So you'll have this like glitched out fucking Gohan that doesn't even animate right, and he'll sit there kind of spazzing out for a while, and then out of nowhere, this one-shot beam just shoots out of his mouth and kills the other guy.

744
00:39:42,491 --> 00:39:49,083
Scott: You'll also have guys with like HP, where like they take tons and tons of damage constantly, but they hardly lose any health because they have Mexi HP, yeah.

745
00:39:51,851 --> 00:40:01,690
Rym: The fact that this culture has grown so quickly, and it's such a unique part of the internet, I enjoy it thoroughly, and I can't really tell you why.

746
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:06,287
Scott: It's like if I really just don't feel like doing anything, you know, I just put on some salty bit.

747
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:10,788
Scott: And especially if I see a tweet that says there's a Shaker classic going on, I am so in on that.

748
00:40:11,031 --> 00:40:16,150
Scott: Because the fights in the Shaker classic are so real, they go down to the wire usually.

749
00:40:16,553 --> 00:40:17,250
Scott: It's crazy good.

750
00:40:17,551 --> 00:40:19,550
Rym: Oh yeah, Eris winning handily.

751
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:22,810
Rym: The waifu is pretty, uh, it's not doing so hot.

752
00:40:23,972 --> 00:40:24,809
Scott: Aww, that's sad.

753
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:25,750
Rym: Yeah, it wasn't a dream though.

754
00:40:25,951 --> 00:40:26,969
Scott: I think people know that he sounds bad.

755
00:40:27,072 --> 00:40:27,590
Scott: I always bit waifus.

756
00:40:27,671 --> 00:40:29,549
Rym: I learned waifus burn me too many times.

757
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:30,146
Rym: I don't know.

758
00:40:30,892 --> 00:40:31,829
Scott: I always bit Toho though.

759
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:40,869
Rym: So I don't know what else we can say, I mean I'm watching salty bit and I keep getting distracted because I got salty bucks riding on this shit.

760
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:41,830
Scott: Right, but who would think about it, right?

761
00:40:42,131 --> 00:40:48,769
Scott: It's like, it's already, when you're sitting there watching your friends play a video game, most of the time it's like boring, I want to play, I want to watch.

762
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:49,870
Rym: Sometimes it's not.

763
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:57,129
Rym: Like when we hang out, like two people are playing, I don't know, Street Fighter IV and the rest of us are on the couch, we'll kind of watch it while we're hanging out.

764
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:01,710
Scott: Yeah, but this is like, I'll intently watch salty bit and it's AI's fighting each other.

765
00:41:02,133 --> 00:41:02,709
Scott: It's crazy.

766
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:07,570
Rym: It would not be as interesting if it was always real people, if it was always real characters.

767
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:13,910
Scott: I think originally they built this system so you could bet the fake money on some like real fighting tournaments, like pros fighting.

768
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:14,907
Rym: But I like it way more.

769
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:19,689
Scott: But then they took that system and put the salty bit into it when there weren't any real tournaments happening.

770
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:28,970
Rym: Because the moments will be like, one time this tiny little Kenshiro came up against a gigantic colossus and I bet on Kenshiro.

771
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:31,567
Scott: X-Men colossus versus Hokuto.

772
00:41:31,588 --> 00:41:31,890
Scott: no Ken.

773
00:41:32,092 --> 00:41:32,589
Scott: Think about that.

774
00:41:32,952 --> 00:41:33,290
Scott: That's amazing.

775
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,847
Rym: Kenshiro on screen was like 15 pixels tall.

776
00:41:36,373 --> 00:41:37,150
Scott: Always bet hitbox.

777
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:42,583
Rym: So I bet him and then the match starts and just WOOTAAH and he hits colossus, one shots him.

778
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:43,417
Rym: WOOTAAH.

779
00:41:44,455 --> 00:41:45,470
Scott: It was a beauty to behold.

780
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,929
Scott: Omae wa mou shindeiru.

781
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:52,192
Rym: But this other time there was this glitched out fucking Servbot versus someone else and they were fighting.

782
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:59,469
Rym: and then the Servbot just like starts spazzing out and floating up higher and higher and higher and just flew off the screen and never came back.

783
00:42:00,411 --> 00:42:00,518
Rym: Okay.

784
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:03,869
Rym: And then the chat people were like, his people needed him.

785
00:42:06,653 --> 00:42:10,690
Scott: I think, you know ever see a movie and there's some kind of fight and people are betting on it, right?

786
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:14,146
Scott: Like think about, for example, in Street Fighter 2, the background on Vegas.

787
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:19,430
Rym: There's always the guy standing there like shouting odds and taking money from people and handing them tickets.

788
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:22,928
Scott: There's people with a fist full of money and they're just pumping their fist.

789
00:42:22,948 --> 00:42:24,049
Scott: that's full of money, right?

790
00:42:24,731 --> 00:42:30,510
Scott: Or there'll be people surrounding a cage where people are fighting, banging on the cage with money in their fist and money falling down, right?

791
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,749
Rym: Huron Barter Town.

792
00:42:32,178 --> 00:42:32,350
Scott: Right.

793
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:38,870
Scott: And it's like, if you think about that stereotypical scene of people betting on something, you know, some sort of gambling fight.

794
00:42:39,151 --> 00:42:53,688
Scott: When you're watching Salty Bet and you're betting and reading the chat and you're into it, it's like you feel like you're in one of those situations where you're the guy standing next to the cage with a fist full of money, shaking it, watching the fight, going, yeah, go whoever you are.

795
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:54,176
Scott: Yeah.

796
00:42:54,691 --> 00:42:55,248
Scott: Kick his ass.

797
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:56,090
Scott: Yeah, dude.

798
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:56,538
Scott: Yeah.

799
00:42:56,811 --> 00:42:58,489
Scott: And it's like, it just puts you in that mood.

800
00:42:58,832 --> 00:43:00,027
Rym: It is what horse racing.

801
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:13,109
Scott: It feels like what horse racing looks like in the movies without the horrible illegal parts or the real money or just the sad parts or the sad homeless guy betting his last dollar or the poorly treated.

802
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:23,749
Rym: But this has that moment where you buy the ticket for the long shot and it almost wins and then it loses and you tear the ticket up and throw it on the ground, except I tear up my virtual ticket and throw it on the ground.

803
00:43:25,033 --> 00:43:27,149
Rym: I only got like seven hundred salty bucks right now.

804
00:43:27,974 --> 00:43:28,829
Scott: Yeah, I actually pay.

805
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:33,470
Scott: So you can pay real money for Salty Bet, which I did, not because I care about how much salt.

806
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:37,650
Rym: Now do you realize half our listeners are laughing hysterically now at that admission, What?

807
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,530
Rym: That you paid money for Salty Bucks.

808
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,929
Scott: OK, so I didn't pay money.

809
00:43:41,272 --> 00:43:42,070
Rym: I also paid money.

810
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:44,730
Scott: Right, because I don't really care about winning Salty Bet.

811
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,129
Scott: It's like I'll just go all in every time.

812
00:43:46,692 --> 00:43:49,990
Rym: Poison is definitely going to beat that glitched fucking SpongeBob.

813
00:43:51,115 --> 00:43:52,128
Scott: I don't know about that.

814
00:43:52,978 --> 00:43:53,250
Scott: Anyway.

815
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:55,030
Rym: I'm betting on poison.

816
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:56,390
Scott: SpongeBob is hit bucks.

817
00:43:56,572 --> 00:43:58,349
Rym: He is definitely going to win.

818
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:02,170
Rym: Anyway, look at that sad bender in the background.

819
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:03,230
Scott: Yeah, I know.

820
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:03,460
Scott: Right.

821
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:11,610
Scott: Um, I bet I paid money to Salty Bet as basically I just wanted to reward the people for coming up with this like, holy crap, this is amazing.

822
00:44:11,811 --> 00:44:12,410
Scott: Take my money.

823
00:44:12,893 --> 00:44:14,390
Scott: And, you know, so I gave him 30 bucks.

824
00:44:14,472 --> 00:44:15,049
Scott: It's like whatevs.

825
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:15,969
Scott: It's no deal for me.

826
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,430
Scott: I have money, but Salty Bet.

827
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:18,950
Scott: It's like I do not want this to disappear.

828
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:19,510
Scott: It's incredible.

829
00:44:20,511 --> 00:44:25,349
Scott: And the fact that the benefits I get, hell, SpongeBob, I don't even use the benefits I get from it.

830
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:30,990
Scott: So the benefits you get by giving them money is that number one, you can't go below 600 salty bucks.

831
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:35,470
Scott: So basically I could, if I wanted to, I can go all in every time and just feed the economy.

832
00:44:36,238 --> 00:44:36,470
Scott: Right.

833
00:44:36,731 --> 00:44:40,990
Scott: And eventually a dream will come true and I'll be mega rich, but a big deal.

834
00:44:41,071 --> 00:44:42,730
Scott: I can't use this money for anything else.

835
00:44:42,952 --> 00:44:43,721
Scott: So what does it matter?

836
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:44,550
Scott: how much I have?

837
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:51,489
Scott: All that matters is that the more I bet on an individual fight, the more I end up like sort of caring about the result.

838
00:44:51,952 --> 00:44:55,310
Scott: So it's like going all in every time actually gives you the greatest enjoyment.

839
00:44:55,573 --> 00:44:56,569
Rym: Oh, this fight is real.

840
00:44:57,216 --> 00:44:57,689
Scott: I know, right?

841
00:44:58,171 --> 00:45:02,208
Scott: You get the greatest enjoyment of Salty... No, yes!

842
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:06,370
Rym: Look, it came down to one goddamn bar, poison one badly.

843
00:45:06,531 --> 00:45:07,008
Scott: Real, so real.

844
00:45:07,354 --> 00:45:07,868
Rym: Oh, my God.

845
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:11,370
Scott: Yeah, you get the most enjoyment by betting more.

846
00:45:11,811 --> 00:45:14,130
Scott: And it's like if you lose, so what?

847
00:45:14,651 --> 00:45:16,970
Scott: Even if you didn't pay money or in the salt mines, you have 10 bucks.

848
00:45:17,242 --> 00:45:17,330
Scott: Fine.

849
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:21,489
Scott: You bet all your 10 bucks for the dream, right, and hope you win and you'll get out of the mines.

850
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:24,910
Scott: And you see plenty of people in the chat are like, yes, out of the mines.

851
00:45:25,215 --> 00:45:26,010
Scott: So it happens.

852
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:27,048
Scott: It happens pretty often.

853
00:45:28,391 --> 00:45:38,965
Scott: The other benefit you get is that if you're in like the Illuminati, you can actually look up the stats and see basically in real time, you know, how many wins and losses each character has.

854
00:45:39,391 --> 00:45:44,409
Scott: So you can sort of know who to bet on, like buying a magazine that tells you which horse is better and the horse races.

855
00:45:44,697 --> 00:45:44,908
Rym: Yep.

856
00:45:45,291 --> 00:45:52,750
Scott: I never even use it, because if I look at that, basically, all I'm basically seeing is either A, this side is one fight, one sided.

857
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:56,430
Scott: And now there's no reason to even watch that fight, because now I'm just going to bet.

858
00:45:56,930 --> 00:46:03,590
Scott: And if I bet on the loser, it's like, oh, oh, well, this does, you know, you got to watch out, too, because, OK, Gohan wins a lot.

859
00:46:03,671 --> 00:46:04,218
Rym: But there's like 100 GoHans.

860
00:46:05,792 --> 00:46:08,010
Scott: Well, you can figure out which one it is by looking carefully.

861
00:46:08,614 --> 00:46:08,868
Rym: Usually.

862
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:09,301
Scott: Yeah.

863
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:12,649
Scott: Other people will be like, fake Gohan, fake Gohan, they'll let you know.

864
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,438
Rym: The thing is, people lie just as all.

865
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:16,226
Rym: yeah, poison crush, trust.

866
00:46:16,266 --> 00:46:17,588
Scott: because of the way the betting works.

867
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:18,649
Scott: You cannot trust the chat.

868
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:24,068
Scott: The people who know which character is going to win want everyone else to bet on the character that is going to lose.

869
00:46:24,492 --> 00:46:26,049
Scott: That way they get more money.

870
00:46:26,591 --> 00:46:29,010
Scott: Most times everyone bets on the one who's going to win.

871
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:30,709
Scott: No one bets on the one that's going to lose.

872
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:33,490
Scott: Ninety nine percent of the time, the dream does not happen.

873
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:35,569
Scott: The winner who is expected to win wins.

874
00:46:36,492 --> 00:46:38,169
Scott: The stronger horse wins the race.

875
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:46,410
Scott: Everyone who bet on the strong horse gets holla holla yada, one dollar, just one dollar and everyone, the losers lose everything.

876
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:47,689
Rym: Oh, it's the magic girl.

877
00:46:48,371 --> 00:46:52,670
Rym: OK, but Gohan Grande, Normale, Grande, Normale.

878
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:54,810
Scott: Be magical from as Yu-Gi-Oh!

879
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:55,064
Scott: Right.

880
00:46:55,537 --> 00:46:55,910
Rym: Oh, yeah.

881
00:46:56,174 --> 00:46:56,489
Scott: Yeah.

882
00:46:57,493 --> 00:47:00,910
Scott: I think I bet on her once and I was sad for doing so.

883
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:01,850
Scott: If I remember correctly.

884
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:02,410
Scott: I got two grand.

885
00:47:02,732 --> 00:47:04,910
Rym: I'm putting it all on Gohan, Grande, Normale.

886
00:47:05,373 --> 00:47:09,787
Scott: I think that might be a good idea because I remember Be Magic Girl did not come through for me once when I bet on her.

887
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:11,690
Rym: El Grande go home.

888
00:47:11,851 --> 00:47:12,749
Rym: All in on penguin?

889
00:47:13,491 --> 00:47:14,930
Rym: Oh, there's penguins in the background.

890
00:47:15,454 --> 00:47:15,550
Rym: Yeah.

891
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:17,309
Rym: But they're like real penguins.

892
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:17,869
Rym: They're not.

893
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:18,343
Rym: Yeah.

894
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:20,949
Rym: Salty Bet is super fun.

895
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:21,949
Rym: You guys should play it.

896
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:26,610
Rym: We might do some GeekNights stuff related to streaming ourselves playing Salty Bet.

897
00:47:28,232 --> 00:47:30,590
Scott: We're definitely having Salty Bet fun times.

898
00:47:31,253 --> 00:47:32,450
Scott: I haven't gotten tired of it yet.

899
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:33,450
Scott: I don't know when I will.

900
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:33,494
Rym: OK.

901
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:36,290
Rym: Everyone bet on Gohan, Grande, Normale.

902
00:47:36,874 --> 00:47:37,089
Scott: Yeah.

903
00:47:37,831 --> 00:47:38,205
Scott: There you go.

904
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:39,457
Rym: My $2,000 bet is going to get me 35 bucks.

905
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:42,070
Scott: Hey, not bet.

906
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,636
Scott: See, that's another reason to go.

907
00:47:43,776 --> 00:47:48,349
Scott: all in is that when you do win, you're not going to get holla holla a dollar.

908
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:53,570
Scott: You're going to get like $35, something like that, because you bet enough that you're getting more than a dollar's worth.

909
00:47:55,451 --> 00:48:02,030
Scott: It's just funny how the Salty Bet economy keeps growing because just the way it's built is so many people just get like automatic dollars.

910
00:48:02,531 --> 00:48:07,330
Rym: And so the top bet for this match, someone bet one hundred and twenty five.

911
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:10,270
Scott: The green number is how much they bet to three.

912
00:48:10,553 --> 00:48:11,030
Rym: All right.

913
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:17,070
Scott: They bet one million salty bucks because they know that he's going to win.

914
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:17,990
Scott: Click on toggle.

915
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:19,344
Scott: See what people bet on player two.

916
00:48:20,512 --> 00:48:20,714
Rym: Ah, yep.

917
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:22,316
Scott: There it is.

918
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:24,070
Rym: Fifteen thousand.

919
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:26,850
Rym: They're going to be really about fifteen thousand on that dream.

920
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:28,710
Scott: Listen, if they win, that is the biggest dream.

921
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:29,688
Scott: What are the odds right now?

922
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:32,442
Rym: The odds were fifty eight to one.

923
00:48:32,703 --> 00:48:33,910
Scott: that if he won that.

924
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:34,742
Scott: Are you kidding me?

925
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:37,830
Scott: He would have been the richest and salty bet immediately.

926
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:41,388
Rym: Every time I bet on a DBZ character, I lose all my money.

927
00:48:46,613 --> 00:48:47,146
Scott: That's I don't know.

928
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:47,889
Scott: It's Salty Bet.

929
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:51,530
Scott: The Salty's Dreamcast casino has nothing to do with Dreamcast.

930
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:53,790
Scott: Do not bet on the thing with the blue stick.

931
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:54,225
Rym: Why?

932
00:48:54,552 --> 00:48:55,389
Scott: It never wins.

933
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:56,530
Rym: But look at that thing.

934
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:57,810
Scott: No, I've bet on that before.

935
00:48:57,950 --> 00:48:58,448
Scott: It's a mistake.

936
00:48:58,691 --> 00:49:03,030
Rym: Look, Emma Frost's boobs are moving, but most of the rest of her body is not.

937
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:04,489
Scott: Mistakes were made.

938
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:05,670
Scott: Bet Emma Frost.

939
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:06,387
Scott: I'm telling you.

940
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:08,109
Rym: I'm betting ten dollars on that stick.

941
00:49:08,994 --> 00:49:09,530
Scott: It's dreams.

942
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:11,309
Rym: It's a ten dollar dream.

943
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:12,607
Rym: Ten dollar dream.

944
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:13,968
Rym: Con Me Chon.

945
00:49:14,431 --> 00:49:15,130
Rym: What is that blue stick?

946
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:16,569
Rym: I don't even know what Con Me Chon is from.

947
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:17,169
Rym: What's this up?

948
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:18,128
Scott: It's an ice hockey stick.

949
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:20,308
Rym: Con Me Chon.

950
00:49:21,772 --> 00:49:22,388
Rym: Mugen database.

951
00:49:23,051 --> 00:49:23,350
Rym: All right.

952
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:24,849
Rym: That's the only plus the top link.

953
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:26,770
Scott: There are some characters just in there.

954
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:28,070
Rym: Is a fighter with a big wrench.

955
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:35,066
Rym: But she's the mascot of an online board game and possibly a character of the Mugen game Nijikaku.

956
00:49:35,673 --> 00:49:35,767
Scott: Okay.

957
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:36,610
Rym: Creator.

958
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:38,130
Rym: She was created by a woman.

959
00:49:38,816 --> 00:49:39,050
Scott: Okay.

960
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:40,489
Rym: And you can't download her.

961
00:49:41,096 --> 00:49:41,187
Scott: Okay.

962
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:42,673
Rym: Oh.

963
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,360
Rym: Uh, people bet evenly and she's kicking Emma Frost's ass.

964
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:53,340
Scott: I guess Emma Frost is sucking because I don't know how I've ever seen Emma Frost fight in Mugen this before.

965
00:49:53,601 --> 00:49:54,380
Rym: This is a fake Emma Frost.

966
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,260
Rym: Look at her busted glitchy hair.

967
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:56,760
Scott: Okay.

968
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,640
Scott: Because Con Me Chon is pretty, pretty potato.

969
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,740
Scott: She's not super potato, but she's potato.

970
00:50:02,266 --> 00:50:02,414
Rym: Okay.

971
00:50:03,261 --> 00:50:05,280
Rym: Uh, we're gonna stop now so we can display some more salt in bed.

972
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,710
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

973
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:17,829
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

974
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:23,250
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

975
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:26,190
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

976
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:30,910
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

977
00:50:31,291 --> 00:50:34,466
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

978
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:38,770
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

979
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:41,890
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
