00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:26,927
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:34,519
Rym: God when we get a real studio am I gonna have to save that stupid blue chair for you?

6
00:00:35,282 --> 00:00:36,385
Scott: What what about the blue chair?

7
00:00:36,426 --> 00:00:39,074
Rym: What are you gonna sit in when we record gig nights in the studio?

8
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:40,840
Scott: my freedom chair?

9
00:00:43,503 --> 00:00:44,699
Rym: You're so reclined.

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,287
Rym: Yeah, you're reclined to an extreme amount.

11
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:57,040
Scott: if you're in a reclining chair, and there's no one behind you and no one in front of you Why ever would you not at least partially recline?

12
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,857
Scott: I mean you might not want to fully recline because then you sort of had to pick your head up.

13
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:05,438
Scott: if you want to look at something like a TV, but Always at least partially recline at least do the leg rest thing.

14
00:01:06,823 --> 00:01:07,900
Scott: Hey, why wouldn't you anyway?

15
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,847
Rym: I just really don't want to ever have to like.

16
00:01:09,927 --> 00:01:14,065
Rym: I kind of want to leave that chair here when we move out Cheers not so good.

17
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:15,050
Rym: You know hard.

18
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,194
Rym: It was to get it up those stairs.

19
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:17,440
Rym: the bottom kept falling out.

20
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,308
Scott: Yeah, I think if we move we're gonna need to get like.

21
00:01:19,328 --> 00:01:22,120
Scott: you know we're actually into pay some dump to take away shit.

22
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:23,972
Rym: Yeah, Craigslist, man.

23
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,580
Scott: Yeah that too All right, so remember.

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,655
Scott: I don't know when it was but recently We talked about how we went to that haircut place in the train station.

25
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:37,835
Rym: that was really convenient But sort of expensive and you needed that haircut to match your purse right and those shoes.

26
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:40,293
Scott: people are going like oh $30 for a haircut.

27
00:01:40,313 --> 00:01:40,860
Scott: you're crazy.

28
00:01:41,362 --> 00:01:45,980
Rym: Meanwhile because I happen to have long hair even though I'm a guy I had to pay 60-something dollars.

29
00:01:46,662 --> 00:01:53,999
Scott: All right, so I want a haircut this morning, and so I went in there and the first thing I realized Is that the first time I went there all right?

30
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,863
Scott: Which is the only.

31
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,771
Scott: I've only been there twice is the second time.

32
00:01:57,515 --> 00:02:00,889
Scott: the first time I went there I had apparently gotten there really early.

33
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:06,052
Scott: like before most of the people who work there got there So it was like the only I was.

34
00:02:06,112 --> 00:02:07,780
Scott: I must have been the first one there that morning.

35
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:12,419
Scott: So like the only like girl there washed my hair and like the only guy there cut my hair, right?

36
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:24,000
Scott: But today I got there a little later and like all the working be all the people were there all the barbers and such and The whole other side of that place is like a barbershop, but not just you know.

37
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,680
Scott: It's like a real barbershop, and I was like aha yeah, I gotta go to that side where the men go.

38
00:02:30,864 --> 00:02:32,140
Rym: It depends on what you're getting done.

39
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,980
Rym: I mean I get the nice head massage and that you know the wash.

40
00:02:35,182 --> 00:02:37,500
Scott: They wash your hair, and they cut your hair and whatever.

41
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,665
Scott: Some um you know I like I'm.

42
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:45,429
Scott: it's kind of shabby because I didn't even shower this morning and whatever you know because if someone Else is gonna wash my hair.

43
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,359
Scott: Why should I wash my hair?

44
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,790
Scott: Right it's like dentist the morning.

45
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,533
Scott: I go to the dentist.

46
00:02:50,594 --> 00:02:51,317
Scott: You don't brush your teeth.

47
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:51,939
Rym: Yes, you do.

48
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:55,333
Scott: You brush your teeth the night before maybe but oh good.

49
00:02:55,493 --> 00:02:56,960
Rym: God you brush your teeth in the morning.

50
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,456
Rym: There's nothing dentists hate more because remember they're not brushing your teeth.

51
00:03:00,536 --> 00:03:01,440
Rym: It's not what they do there.

52
00:03:01,741 --> 00:03:02,946
Rym: No, they're getting rid of the plaque.

53
00:03:03,247 --> 00:03:09,253
Rym: if all it does is make your stay much longer and more uncomfortable I'm told the dentist my uncle.

54
00:03:09,293 --> 00:03:12,907
Rym: I'm gonna torture him Brush your teeth before you go to the dentist.

55
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:13,791
Rym: for the love of God.

56
00:03:13,851 --> 00:03:14,815
Scott: No don't don't?

57
00:03:15,197 --> 00:03:15,860
Scott: what are you paying for?

58
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,222
Rym: I'm paying to remove plaque and make sure I don't have Gingivitis.

59
00:03:21,563 --> 00:03:23,171
Scott: so the plaque should be removed when you brush.

60
00:03:23,212 --> 00:03:24,940
Scott: it would be tartar that you would scrape off.

61
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,592
Rym: I believe no plaque is what you're having a scrape.

62
00:03:27,713 --> 00:03:29,220
Rym: anyway tartar can be removed.

63
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:30,411
Rym: I believe plaque cannot.

64
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:31,440
Rym: do we have to look up Wikipedia?

65
00:03:33,302 --> 00:03:34,267
Scott: Why don't we call a dentist?

66
00:03:34,287 --> 00:03:35,854
Scott: because neither of us are dentists.

67
00:03:35,894 --> 00:03:37,220
Rym: we have any dentist listeners.

68
00:03:37,321 --> 00:03:38,527
Rym: I know we have a lot of lawyers.

69
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:39,412
Scott: That would be a very.

70
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:40,237
Scott: we do have a lot on.

71
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,511
Scott: well We have a. I think it is.

72
00:03:42,532 --> 00:03:43,679
Scott: is that the lawyer?

73
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,528
Scott: Here's my thinking.

74
00:03:45,548 --> 00:03:47,442
Rym: oh because I wonder if you have the same thinking I do.

75
00:03:47,683 --> 00:03:53,651
Scott: is that lawyers the kind of people who are lawyers are much more likely to be like Participants because they're you know that they like to talk back.

76
00:03:53,751 --> 00:03:55,760
Rym: Oh wow I was gonna say it much more bluntly.

77
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,346
Rym: I think lawyers are more argumentative.

78
00:03:57,486 --> 00:04:05,179
Rym: Yeah, and because of the somewhat adversarial style of our show It's very easy to decide that maybe an argument should happen.

79
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:08,391
Scott: Anyway, so I went to that place this morning.

80
00:04:08,632 --> 00:04:10,620
Scott: I went to the barber side some old guy.

81
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,985
Scott: I was like hey come on.

82
00:04:12,026 --> 00:04:14,957
Scott: I'm like all right, and I'm like he's like do you want to shave?

83
00:04:15,017 --> 00:04:17,124
Scott: and I'm like Why not yeah?

84
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:17,646
Scott: I'll get a shave.

85
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:18,128
Scott: what the hell?

86
00:04:18,309 --> 00:04:20,740
Rym: Did you get one of those nice straight razor shaves?

87
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,653
Scott: Yeah, except it wasn't so nice really.

88
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,020
Scott: yeah come look at my face.

89
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,325
Scott: It's not too.

90
00:04:26,345 --> 00:04:26,586
Scott: Good.

91
00:04:26,606 --> 00:04:27,610
Scott: It looks good from far away.

92
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,935
Scott: Ah, but it was.

93
00:04:29,016 --> 00:04:30,160
Scott: I could have shaved myself better.

94
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,324
Scott: It's actually under.

95
00:04:31,344 --> 00:04:34,915
Scott: my chin is unshaven spots, and it was all scraping.

96
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:36,600
Rym: did he actually use a straight razor?

97
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,145
Rym: Yeah, you probably just sucked.

98
00:04:38,265 --> 00:04:39,128
Scott: I think you just sucked.

99
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:42,136
Rym: see the thing is it's I mean people like.

100
00:04:42,257 --> 00:04:46,333
Rym: a lot of people accused us When we first started using these you know old-time razors.

101
00:04:46,394 --> 00:04:47,780
Rym: is that you're just doing it cuz it's cool?

102
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:55,579
Rym: Now if we were doing it because it's cool We'd be using straight razors, but let me tell you a straight razor is no better than a safety razor.

103
00:04:55,619 --> 00:04:58,203
Rym: in fact He's worse is too less Mm-hmm.

104
00:04:58,463 --> 00:04:58,925
Rym: It's not gonna.

105
00:04:58,945 --> 00:05:00,289
Rym: Give you a better shave, and you're.

106
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:04,260
Rym: the chance of dying is increased dramatically every morning.

107
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:06,488
Rym: Yep, I don't want my chance of dabbing.

108
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,400
Rym: I already have to worry about falling over and dying in the shower.

109
00:05:09,741 --> 00:05:15,065
Scott: I don't want to worry about cutting my throat open all right, so I'm like oh well I got at least I'm shaving.

110
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,599
Scott: I mean it wasn't great, but I'm shaving whatever right like I cut my hair.

111
00:05:19,004 --> 00:05:20,139
Scott: He cuts my hair just fine.

112
00:05:20,522 --> 00:05:24,340
Scott: You know washes my hair which is nice because that's what I needed cuz they didn't wash it this morning.

113
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:33,086
Scott: Yeah, and then you know I leave you know how much that was how much it's $50 $20 for a bad shave.

114
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:35,856
Rym: I'll shave you for less than what he charged.

115
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:43,039
Scott: yeah for $20 I could have bought in 20 razor blades more than 20 remember I know I could buy like four four packs.

116
00:05:43,522 --> 00:05:45,453
Rym: So and that's the platinum coated nice ones.

117
00:05:45,473 --> 00:05:47,844
Rym: if you're willing to get the cheap ones god They're like five cents each.

118
00:05:47,985 --> 00:05:50,515
Scott: I know right, so it's like wow okay.

119
00:05:50,555 --> 00:05:51,680
Scott: I'm not getting a shave here again.

120
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,190
Scott: Maybe oh, maybe I don't even know if it's worth it for the $30 haircut.

121
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,187
Scott: cuz while the $30 haircut You know it was a fine haircut.

122
00:05:58,348 --> 00:06:01,040
Scott: You know and I got my hair washed, which is you know what I wanted.

123
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:11,249
Scott: Still I mean like it wasn't that it wasn't twice as good as a $14 haircut, so yeah Alright, but anyway.

124
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:22,640
Rym: It is tech day It is you know science and technology and all that and a lot of tech news happened in the last week And we're gonna have to skip most of it because we don't want the show to just be one of those tech news round up.

125
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,493
Scott: Yeah, you can listen to it or something.

126
00:06:24,553 --> 00:06:25,379
Scott: It's not we're not to it.

127
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:34,770
Scott: We refer to them often because they're like you know sort of hard not to refer to when you're a podcast about technology And they're the biggest podcast about technology.

128
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:37,120
Rym: Yeah, plus you know we have special episodes.

129
00:06:37,722 --> 00:06:47,760
Rym: Tech news roundup is code for we totally didn't feel like doing a show and it happens to be Monday and now that we have our alternating IT CS Mondays, that's not gonna be a problem.

130
00:06:48,262 --> 00:06:49,546
Rym: Yeah, so what should I talk about?

131
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:53,640
Rym: I could talk about Pakistan breaking the internet or I could talk to old news isn't it?

132
00:06:53,740 --> 00:07:00,445
Rym: It's not that old all right plus the five mean it was like a week and a half ago plus the follow-up stories have been Going up until today.

133
00:07:00,526 --> 00:07:02,012
Scott: Oh, I didn't know their follow-up stories.

134
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:03,720
Rym: Oh there were a lot of follow-up store.

135
00:07:04,543 --> 00:07:08,296
Rym: But now what I'm gonna talk about is something that oh, I know you're talking about.

136
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:09,500
Rym: so here's the deal.

137
00:07:10,101 --> 00:07:16,500
Rym: Google unveiled something amazing and awesome, and you they've had this functionality before but they've kind of taken it to the next level.

138
00:07:17,043 --> 00:07:19,379
Rym: It's kind of a search within a search.

139
00:07:19,922 --> 00:07:22,674
Rym: So I search for like Best Buy and I end up on Best Buy.

140
00:07:23,136 --> 00:07:29,695
Rym: so now I can search In Best Buy or in the search results that I just had or more stuff.

141
00:07:29,735 --> 00:07:31,500
Scott: Yeah, but let me explain that.

142
00:07:32,522 --> 00:07:33,506
Scott: So you go to Google.

143
00:07:33,546 --> 00:07:35,957
Rym: I was about to but you go ahead you go to google.com.

144
00:07:36,017 --> 00:07:36,720
Scott: right okay?

145
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,744
Scott: I'm going to google.com.

146
00:07:38,346 --> 00:07:40,716
Scott: I type in Wikipedia right.

147
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,815
Scott: it takes It doesn't take you directly to Wikipedia unless you push the I'm feeling lucky button right.

148
00:07:46,276 --> 00:07:51,312
Scott: so if you push the search button Or you press enter it takes you to a list of search results because that's what Google does.

149
00:07:51,774 --> 00:07:53,780
Scott: the top result of course is Wikipedia.

150
00:07:54,402 --> 00:08:06,323
Scott: But under that result before the second result which is the main page of Wikipedia English It's a. there's a little text box that says and then a button and the button says search Wikipedia org.

151
00:08:06,343 --> 00:08:16,853
Scott: so I could actually go in that search Wikipedia org and type in farts and click on it and now It'll actually you know search with site colon Wikipedia org.

152
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:19,160
Rym: so see that this isn't new functionality.

153
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,173
Rym: You could search with site colon a site forever.

154
00:08:22,354 --> 00:08:23,559
Scott: Yeah, that's always existed.

155
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:27,620
Scott: in fact It's very useful because you ever have a site with a really shitty search engine.

156
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:36,039
Scott: Okay, every website right if it it's much easier to search those websites with Google than it is with their shitty search engine.

157
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,229
Scott: So you do is you want to search and gadget?

158
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:58,300
Scott: don't go to engage it and use the engagement search box Go to Google and if you want to search and gadget for I don't know phones type phones space site si te colon and gadget comm and press enter and you will get Google search results But you will only get search pages results that are at in gadget comm.

159
00:08:58,481 --> 00:09:03,860
Rym: It's super useful pretty much to make this easier like if you search for a retailer or something big like Best Buy or whatever.

160
00:09:04,402 --> 00:09:16,435
Rym: it'll do that thing Scott said and it'll make it really easy for people who don't know about all the kind of syntax because you Can put a lot of interesting syntax and arguments into a Google search if you know how to do it Mm-hmm, but they're making it really easy.

161
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:28,720
Rym: now A lot of people are spreading some thought about this and more importantly a lot of people are really Really really angry about this and I I think those people can die in a fire But I also think they can go ahead and fire.

162
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,499
Rym: I think I need to explain a little bit about exactly why this is a concern and what the deal is.

163
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:41,604
Rym: Alright, so in the old days I'd have to go to Best Buy and use their crappy search and I could find stuff on the Best Buy website Marginally and I was it.

164
00:09:42,226 --> 00:09:45,098
Rym: and even if Best Buy had a great search it could only find stuff on Best Buy.

165
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:47,760
Rym: now Let's say I use the Google thing.

166
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,999
Rym: alright, I'm searching on Best Buy site with Google and it's a much better search already.

167
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:59,796
Rym: and Because I'm searching on Google technically I just happen to be searching Best Buy's content.

168
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:06,018
Rym: I See all the ads the Google ads like I would if I was searching on Google.

169
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,440
Rym: now Let's say I search for a certain brand of cell phone that I know Best Buy sells.

170
00:10:11,923 --> 00:10:14,500
Rym: Well, I'll see the Best Buy link in the Best Buy price.

171
00:10:15,222 --> 00:10:20,014
Rym: I'll also see ads for all the competitors who are also selling that cell phone.

172
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:23,522
Scott: Yeah, like the Google ads basically did.

173
00:10:23,562 --> 00:10:34,594
Scott: the difference here the things that the website operators are complaining about is now people who want to search for things on Where they normally would have gone to Best Buy calm and done a search.

174
00:10:34,975 --> 00:10:38,020
Scott: that means they would have loaded multiple Best Buy pages.

175
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:46,177
Scott: Now the person is going to be loading a bunch of Google pages and maybe one Best Buy page if they end up going to a Best Buy page at all.

176
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:49,548
Rym: Now consider the following quote.

177
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:51,416
Rym: this pretty much sums up the jackasses.

178
00:10:51,436 --> 00:10:52,199
Rym: who are against this?

179
00:10:52,921 --> 00:11:00,200
Rym: Google is showing a level of aggressiveness with this that's just not needed said one quote internet consultant.

180
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:06,700
Rym: Take for instance a test where users of Google searched the Washington Post and were given a secondary search box.

181
00:11:07,261 --> 00:11:20,580
Rym: Those who type two jobs into that second box saw related results from the post employment pages, but the results were bombarded by Advertisements for competing employment sites like Career Builder or Monster.com.

182
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:28,436
Rym: So even though the user began the process by stating their intention to reach the post Google's ad steered them to some of their competitors.

183
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:41,079
Rym: now It seems to me that the only argument anyone has against this functionality is That now it is easier for people to compete with you.

184
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,226
Rym: Capitalism I think this is great.

185
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:56,019
Rym: if I search on Best Buy and I want to buy I don't know some CDRs And I see a Google ad that says hey those exact CDRs that Best Buy is charging 10 bucks for We'll give them to you for five.

186
00:11:57,322 --> 00:11:58,166
Rym: Well, what's wrong with that?

187
00:11:58,186 --> 00:12:01,180
Rym: That's gonna put a lot of pressure on P. It's gonna make prices come down.

188
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:12,360
Rym: It's good for everyone But people who can't actually compete in a free market and rely on the fact that consumers are generally ignorant or Rely on the fact that while all the information is technically available.

189
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:14,772
Rym: It's difficult to get all that information together.

190
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:16,078
Rym: Google more and more.

191
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:25,793
Rym: But the beauty of Google is not so much that they allow you to find information It's that they allow you to find the same like stratum of information across different sources.

192
00:12:26,555 --> 00:12:34,160
Rym: and by bringing that information together Consumers can be so much more informed and no one can get away with having high prices ever.

193
00:12:35,344 --> 00:12:37,503
Scott: yeah, Google is uh Pretty good.

194
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:47,438
Rym: Yeah, but and I you know if you read the article You'll see that pretty much everyone complaining against this just either really doesn't understand it or understands it all too.

195
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:50,791
Scott: Well Yeah, they're crazy SEO bastards.

196
00:12:51,232 --> 00:13:02,980
Rym: Yeah, but seriously I I Mean I could see a lawsuit or something coming out of this But I imagine Google would win and I have yet to see any legitimate argument against Google doing well.

197
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,237
Scott: They never complained before.

198
00:13:04,257 --> 00:13:10,900
Scott: now They're only complaining because suddenly there's a text box and a button making a feature that's existed for a long time easier to do.

199
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:14,073
Scott: If it wasn't a problem to do it before why is it suddenly?

200
00:13:14,113 --> 00:13:15,720
Scott: it shouldn't be a problem to make it easier?

201
00:13:16,122 --> 00:13:19,100
Rym: Well, remember these retailers have always had a history of this sort of thing.

202
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:28,150
Rym: I mean if you ever want to see an example of this go to like a Best Buy or Circuit City or whatever with a big old notebook and Walk-around writing down prices of things.

203
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:28,953
Rym: There's a good chance.

204
00:13:28,994 --> 00:13:30,480
Rym: You'll be kicked out within a few minutes.

205
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:36,298
Rym: Mm-hmm because retailers that I don't even get into that suffice to say I said it.

206
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:36,859
Rym: I said it.

207
00:13:37,242 --> 00:13:44,474
Rym: You didn't want me to say it, but I said it Google's doing nothing but good here, and I don't think I can beat that horse further.

208
00:13:44,795 --> 00:13:46,020
Rym: No, so what do you got for me?

209
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,460
Scott: So I remember all that satellite radio.

210
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:54,733
Scott: I mean satellite radio feels to me like it was really big Few years ago, and it's sort of gotten a little.

211
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,115
Scott: they like.

212
00:13:55,135 --> 00:14:02,703
Scott: they said they were gonna merge Or maybe there was gonna be a merger and then it was quiet, and it seems like you know satellite radio sort of been Since then.

213
00:14:02,723 --> 00:14:07,560
Rym: satellite radio would have been great if I didn't have podcasts iPod and my own music collection.

214
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:10,730
Scott: Yeah, but basically they they you know.

215
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,937
Scott: the question was are we gonna let these guys merge?

216
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:13,900
Scott: and the answer is yes.

217
00:14:13,981 --> 00:14:20,600
Scott: And they basically said the obvious Statement of the Department of Justice antitrust division is decision blah blah blah.

218
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,968
Scott: Basically evidence does not establish.

219
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:27,060
Scott: the combination of radio providers substantially reduce competition.

220
00:14:27,522 --> 00:14:28,527
Scott: Basically the summary it up.

221
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:38,259
Scott: They said there were too many other options, so Combining all the satellite radios isn't a big deal because there's other there's am/fm radios and there's internet radios and whatnot.

222
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,667
Scott: so it's not A big deal huh.

223
00:14:39,768 --> 00:14:41,278
Rym: that's like the opposite of what happened with dr.

224
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,973
Rym: Pepper back in the when coca-cola tried to buy them out.

225
00:14:44,214 --> 00:14:54,107
Scott: yeah, but yeah Radio is sort of a weird thing because it's sort of cool in that you can it's you really high-quality radio Right if you can have live stuff on it.

226
00:14:54,147 --> 00:14:56,013
Scott: Just like broadcast radio, but there's.

227
00:14:56,074 --> 00:14:58,000
Scott: no it's a lot easier to get reception.

228
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:01,930
Scott: You can get a lot more channels you.

229
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,773
Scott: the audio quality.

230
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:03,537
Scott: I think is better.

231
00:15:03,577 --> 00:15:04,300
Scott: It must be right.

232
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:08,013
Scott: There's a lot less commercials if if there's any commercials at all.

233
00:15:08,335 --> 00:15:09,540
Scott: I don't know that much about it.

234
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:10,638
Scott: I never actually listen to it.

235
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:16,077
Scott: And there's a lot more selection of stuff And you can actually get some pretty niche weird kind of stuff on there.

236
00:15:16,097 --> 00:15:16,238
Scott: like.

237
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:23,067
Scott: I know There's a lot of podcasts that just they play on their podcasts on the internet And then they play on satellite radio also.

238
00:15:23,107 --> 00:15:26,820
Scott: just you know the satellite radio provider takes the podcast and puts it on the satellite radio.

239
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,500
Scott: It's actually looks a jewel time.

240
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:35,356
Rym: I actually really looked into doing that for GeekNights and the only reason we haven't done it is that it's kind of a Gigantic pain in the ass.

241
00:15:35,377 --> 00:15:42,654
Scott: yeah Your show has to be like exactly like to the second a certain length And you have to put little noises in your show so they know.

242
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:48,523
Scott: so the automatic Satellite radio system can insert your audio and pretty much I'm nothing.

243
00:15:48,543 --> 00:15:53,626
Rym: we're never gonna be syndicated like that unless we get to the point where we have paid staff to deal with all that Crap for me.

244
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:54,475
Scott: yeah pretty much.

245
00:15:55,462 --> 00:15:56,847
Scott: Yeah, I think this is pretty interesting.

246
00:15:56,887 --> 00:16:02,872
Scott: I mean this is either going to result in You know both the satellite radio going.

247
00:16:02,892 --> 00:16:04,560
Scott: uh this is tote the whole.

248
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:10,359
Scott: I mean you have an entire industry embodied in one company right so it's a lot easier than other industries.

249
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:11,706
Scott: you go How's the industry doing?

250
00:16:11,746 --> 00:16:14,480
Scott: is a lot of companies and some are doing good and some are doing bad?

251
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,720
Scott: You're like the whole industry's in one company.

252
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,855
Scott: So we know if satellite radio is a good idea or not based on the success of this.

253
00:16:21,156 --> 00:16:22,280
Scott: now one company.

254
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:28,635
Scott: but The question will be is it is it gonna succeed or is it is it blend?

255
00:16:28,756 --> 00:16:29,036
Scott: Yeah?

256
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:29,578
Scott: I don't know.

257
00:16:29,598 --> 00:16:32,187
Scott: I Satellite radio, there's some things.

258
00:16:32,227 --> 00:16:34,135
Scott: I like about it, but really I'm not.

259
00:16:34,155 --> 00:16:35,059
Scott: you don't see me buying it.

260
00:16:35,581 --> 00:16:42,826
Rym: I think that the main reason why I would never consider satellite radio is that it's still push rather than pull I mean, it's not like well.

261
00:16:42,846 --> 00:16:43,047
Rym: I mean

262
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:47,044
Scott: you have a lot more choices, so it's a little bit of pull I mean, but

263
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:49,519
Rym: not really it has the same pull that cable TV

264
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:50,563
Scott: Exactly got

265
00:16:50,583 --> 00:17:01,676
Rym: a thousand channels, but if I want to listen to like whatever and whatever's on at eight o'clock I'm pretty much screwed unless it's eight o'clock, or I have some sort of TiVo for my radio.

266
00:17:01,716 --> 00:17:03,040
Scott: see like cable television.

267
00:17:03,281 --> 00:17:08,142
Scott: I think that satellite radio would do well to move to some sort of on-demand type Programming.

268
00:17:08,383 --> 00:17:20,300
Rym: yeah, but the infrastructure really isn't fully in place for that especially because every time anyone tries to do something like that Especially with radio it seems like everyone in the industry jumps down their throat and starts screaming about copyright.

269
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,750
Rym: And you see there is.

270
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:23,339
Scott: there was some sort of on-demand radio.

271
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:23,842
Scott: That would be.

272
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,715
Scott: that's it for podcast you know because that's really.

273
00:17:26,756 --> 00:17:30,830
Scott: that's the one reason I want to have a moat like the iPod.

274
00:17:30,851 --> 00:17:37,328
Scott: if you want to get podcasts on the iPod you have to plug it in to a Computer and sync it with iTunes.

275
00:17:37,408 --> 00:17:44,640
Scott: if the iPod could just get podcasts on its own Right had iTunes or podcatcher built into it or any other mp3 playing device.

276
00:17:45,303 --> 00:17:54,680
Scott: That's the same thing as on-demand radio because you could just browse the web find any podcast Get the episode no matter where you are as long as you have Wi-Fi, and then it's on-demand radio.

277
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,164
Scott: And that is what we really need.

278
00:17:56,425 --> 00:18:01,260
Scott: and satellite radio could beat the podcast mobile device to it if they moved.

279
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,047
Scott: But I don't see them moving well.

280
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:04,754
Rym: There are a lot of limitations.

281
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:09,220
Rym: I mean remember satellite radio is Not exactly to weigh.

282
00:18:09,742 --> 00:18:15,740
Scott: Yeah, I think another problem with satellite radio is that they all all the devices seem to be like these car devices.

283
00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:19,040
Scott: You know where's the carry in my pocket satellite radio.

284
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,885
Scott: Do they make one of those?

285
00:18:19,905 --> 00:18:22,580
Rym: see what I would have done if I was setting up satellite radios.

286
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,362
Rym: I would have sold.

287
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:29,744
Rym: you could buy like base stations for anything once for cars once for RVs once for in your house once for Outside.

288
00:18:29,844 --> 00:18:32,480
Scott: I think they have house ones that you can hook up to your like receiver.

289
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:34,365
Rym: Oh, yeah But I would have made like all those things.

290
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:45,002
Rym: and then the simple way is you what you get for your subscription is like a Little key a little dongle little thing and whatever satellite radio thing you plug it into you get your service Regardless.

291
00:18:45,022 --> 00:18:47,151
Rym: so I can bring my service with me go to my friend's house.

292
00:18:47,171 --> 00:18:48,357
Rym: He has satellite radio course.

293
00:18:48,778 --> 00:18:57,990
Rym: theoretically He should have a dongle, but if you had some sort of subscription model Or you know semi on demand or maybe you pick likes you know all that There are a lot of better ways.

294
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,359
Rym: It could have been handled than it was handled.

295
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:05,280
Rym: Yeah, I feel like they competed in a market that was on the verge of becoming a different mark.

296
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:11,980
Rym: well They created the market and then no they were competing in the market of listening to audio when I am not home.

297
00:19:12,321 --> 00:19:15,600
Rym: Yeah, and the problem is they they jumped in with the right technology.

298
00:19:16,183 --> 00:19:24,280
Rym: The problem is they should have jumped in a few years earlier Or they should have jumped in a little bit later, but they would have jumped in like pre iPod.

299
00:19:24,461 --> 00:19:32,220
Scott: I think that like a couple years before the iPod came out I seriously believe the satellite radio would be like the default in cars.

300
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:43,740
Rym: Am/fm might have died if they'd been around when I was in high school because remember I didn't even have a CD player For a long time and then in my car I had my CD player, and I would make mix CDs.

301
00:19:44,242 --> 00:19:49,218
Rym: I would have paid a lot to have had even an mp3 player, and if there had been satellite radio.

302
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:51,570
Scott: Oh, man Yep, oh well.

303
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:51,933
Scott: Well.

304
00:19:51,953 --> 00:19:53,019
Scott: We'll see what comes to this.

305
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:56,958
Scott: I I'm gonna give it six months or so before we can make a verdict.

306
00:19:57,981 --> 00:20:00,288
Scott: I think they'll definitely last at least that long.

307
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:08,260
Rym: so I got one more little news partly because a lot of people are probably Somewhat in the dark as to exactly what the deal was with this.

308
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:14,000
Rym: But I'm sure you've all heard the stories that Pakistan broke YouTube or Pakistan broke the internet something.

309
00:20:14,101 --> 00:20:14,965
Scott: Oh, it's an old story.

310
00:20:15,026 --> 00:20:28,900
Rym: It's not that old a few weeks old, but anyway The fullness of this was that Pakistan ordered all of its ISPs to block access to YouTube because YouTube contains quote blasphemous web content slash movies.

311
00:20:30,182 --> 00:20:44,740
Rym: Now there's some arguments that that might have just been a cover story Because it kind of coincides with a lot of political unrest in Pakistan And there were a lot of videos kind of pointing out certain things about the government in Pakistan at the time.

312
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:50,039
Rym: But nominally this was partly because of the whole Muhammad cartoons OMG thing.

313
00:20:51,233 --> 00:21:17,474
Rym: well Basically what happened here was that Pakistan said all right YouTube is no longer cool in Pakistan, but what they did is Instead of enforcing it legally they enforced it technologically by advertising false routing information To YouTube's websites these false routes because of the way the internet works partly because people trusted Pakistan Which I don't think anyone wouldn't.

314
00:21:17,494 --> 00:21:22,370
Scott: they just tell all Pakistani ISPs to block traffic to the YouTube IP addresses.

315
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:27,527
Rym: Well what they did is that's difficult to do yeah, but what they did is they firewall it out.

316
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:28,229
Scott: I don't know they.

317
00:21:29,211 --> 00:21:39,058
Rym: There's arguments that they did this maliciously uh-huh in order to pretty much censor this as far and wide as they could but no one we can't know for sure because we Don't have access to it really feels.

318
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:42,794
Scott: it feels to me like an incompetent IT Situation.

319
00:21:43,397 --> 00:21:50,423
Scott: it feels to me like there might have been minor malicious intent But at the same time the people who got poisoned by the bad data.

320
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:52,630
Scott: it feels like that they that shouldn't happen.

321
00:21:54,150 --> 00:22:05,409
Rym: You're supposed to be able to trust the routing information you get and Regardless of whether or not people did trust it the fact remains that Pakistan was advertising false routes Yep, which is bullshit.

322
00:22:05,671 --> 00:22:06,375
Scott: It is like.

323
00:22:06,395 --> 00:22:06,757
Rym: that is.

324
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:15,050
Rym: one of the fundamental things that makes the internet Go is that people don't lie about the basic low-level stuff of the internet.

325
00:22:15,372 --> 00:22:28,695
Rym: That's why every now and then when there's a big internet problem It's because one of the high-level providers has had some sort of peering dispute with another high-level provider And that is one of the biggest reasons why we need some more network network neutrality legislation.

326
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:30,547
Rym: but I digress.

327
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:45,849
Rym: so Pakistan advertised these false routes and these routes got propagated around the world and that is why There was a period where YouTube was very difficult to access from many parts of the world and a lot of internet traffic was being Routed all over the place in bad ways.

328
00:22:46,652 --> 00:22:49,120
Scott: See the thing is that the thing with that right shouldn't that?

329
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:50,104
Scott: shouldn't the people?

330
00:22:50,124 --> 00:22:51,950
Scott: I mean if you are in?

331
00:22:52,150 --> 00:23:02,278
Scott: Pakistan obviously the false route will screw you right but Someone if you're somewhere else and you know somehow they advertise this false route Shouldn't you like there should be some sort of?

332
00:23:02,318 --> 00:23:04,044
Scott: there's a hierarchy of authority right?

333
00:23:04,064 --> 00:23:06,686
Scott: I mean the Pakistani ISP Don't you know?

334
00:23:07,391 --> 00:23:09,500
Scott: My big router in the sky isn't gonna listen to them.

335
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,448
Scott: when it comes to where the question of where is you?

336
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:11,830
Rym: well when it?

337
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:23,589
Rym: Comes to BGP routes and that I mean routes are summarized in very broad brushes on the internet because broad brush routes take a lot less processing power to deal with and they're less difficult to maintain.

338
00:23:23,629 --> 00:23:30,309
Rym: and basically what happened was there's this kind of implicit trust among high-level ISPs worldwide.

339
00:23:30,329 --> 00:23:47,375
Rym: and My take on all this is that Pakistan then as a nation at least as far as their technology and government is concerned Has violated that trust and I note how it was rather rapid the response of the world in Containing and removing these routes.

340
00:23:48,117 --> 00:23:52,890
Rym: I don't think anyone is ever going to trust routing information that comes out of Pakistan ever again.

341
00:23:53,493 --> 00:23:55,908
Scott: Mmm, and yeah, I there really needs to be like.

342
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:58,600
Scott: You know some sort of web of trust like.

343
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,110
Scott: I trust these people more than these people more than you know.

344
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:06,330
Rym: So the problem is something like that requires updates to routing protocols updates to routers.

345
00:24:07,231 --> 00:24:07,874
Rym: It's not easy.

346
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:10,424
Scott: You can't just like type some things in your Cisco and make it happen.

347
00:24:11,107 --> 00:24:17,410
Rym: Not really Every road routing protocol has its pros and cons and this is usually BGP type stuff.

348
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,282
Rym: I I'll do a show on routing protocol someday in the future.

349
00:24:20,302 --> 00:24:20,864
Rym: I'll warn you.

350
00:24:21,005 --> 00:24:27,369
Scott: It's not interesting Because I the way I you know, cuz I don't know much about the routing prop.

351
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:35,030
Scott: You know propagation of routes, but I know about like, you know The propagation of DNS and DNS poisoning and it really DNS poisoning is very hard to do.

352
00:24:36,172 --> 00:24:39,530
Scott: But yes, I feel like shouldn't the routing poisoning be?

353
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:42,980
Rym: Routing is a lot more complicated than DNS.

354
00:24:43,502 --> 00:24:55,850
Scott: All right, tell you what and sometime soon I'll do a show on like routing protocols for dummies like how the internet works like how Like if I set up a DNS server and I my DNS server says Google's up your butt it's not gonna work.

355
00:24:56,434 --> 00:25:00,735
Scott: No one's gonna end up up your butt when they were looking for Google Except maybe the people.

356
00:25:00,755 --> 00:25:04,310
Rym: that's a very I don't know what but that's a very Dave Riley kind of phrase right there.

357
00:25:04,652 --> 00:25:06,989
Scott: No one's gonna end up at up your butt.

358
00:25:08,394 --> 00:25:11,709
Rym: I can actually answer this very broadly and very succinctly.

359
00:25:12,151 --> 00:25:19,576
Rym: The reason DNS is so much more robust against that sort of attack is because DNS is a hierarchy That is a straight-up tree.

360
00:25:19,817 --> 00:25:21,763
Rym: There is a root of DNS a top.

361
00:25:22,225 --> 00:25:25,836
Rym: Yeah, that is the absolute top That is 100% trusted.

362
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:30,992
Rym: Yeah, and then like there's this hierarchy going down and it's extremely strict hierarchy Mm-hmm.

363
00:25:31,153 --> 00:25:33,482
Rym: The internet is not a hierarchy.

364
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:35,529
Rym: It's a gigantic messy web.

365
00:25:36,112 --> 00:25:39,270
Scott: Yeah, but I mean I trust sprint more than I trust Pakistan.

366
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:45,030
Rym: All right, you trust sprint But where do you get your routes from and you have connections all over the world and everyone?

367
00:25:45,452 --> 00:25:50,619
Rym: It's so hard to manage all those routes that a lot of I'll talk about on the show.

368
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:55,590
Rym: Yeah, but suffice to say Number two, you gotta think of a different phrase instead.

369
00:25:56,273 --> 00:25:57,679
Scott: Someone think of an alternate phrase.

370
00:25:58,161 --> 00:26:00,230
Rym: be that as it may that doesn't quite fit though.

371
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,117
Rym: I like that though, but it means something different.

372
00:26:02,318 --> 00:26:03,021
Scott: I know whatever.

373
00:26:03,443 --> 00:26:05,310
Rym: I could just say something completely random.

374
00:26:06,093 --> 00:26:09,607
Rym: So fizzle bottom your mom your mom.

375
00:26:09,627 --> 00:26:28,801
Rym: Okay Pakistan's mom apparently, uh I had a bunch of other stories that are all related to this because recently a film that was being made about the Prophet Muhammad that may or may not have been casting him in a bad light was taken down by the ISP hosting it on the grounds that was blasphemous.

376
00:26:28,861 --> 00:26:36,908
Rym: and there seems to be more and more a lot of problems in regards to the internet and portrayals of Muhammad.

377
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:42,110
Rym: and I don't want to get into a religious argument because I don't think this is a religious argument.

378
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:44,320
Rym: I don't think this has anything to do with religion at all.

379
00:26:45,093 --> 00:26:47,515
Rym: freedom of speech wins Regardless.

380
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:49,730
Scott: Yeah, it's the same amendment asshole.

381
00:26:50,256 --> 00:26:51,227
Rym: Well in the cut in the u.s.

382
00:26:51,510 --> 00:27:12,810
Rym: See the problem is that there are nations like Pakistan who decide to lie on the internet in order to prevent us from seeing pictures of Muhammad or possibly to prevent us from seeing well prevent Pakistanis from seeing what's actually going on in the government, but fizzle bottom I'm very much getting to the point where I'm sick of this and I'm done with it and I don't know.

383
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:23,893
Rym: I feel like the bodies that govern the internet and the United Nations should have some sort of universal code of freedom of speech over communication means Yeah, something like that.

384
00:27:24,154 --> 00:27:26,599
Rym: Yeah, but that's a show for another time.

385
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:34,939
Rym: All right things of the day.

386
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:42,727
Rym: So you ever get an email from someone where it's from like sprint comm but in the reply to address They don't want you to respond.

387
00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:55,960
Rym: They give you some crap like Blah blah blah at do not reply calm or they make up some address so you can't email them back because they don't want to Get deluged with people who can't read who just hit reply and then just you know, shoot their mouth off.

388
00:27:58,634 --> 00:28:00,326
Rym: I guess that was a rhetorical question.

389
00:28:00,426 --> 00:28:00,970
Rym: I'll continue.

390
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,608
Scott: Yeah, I guess.

391
00:28:04,476 --> 00:28:06,410
Scott: So I was actually reading something.

392
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:14,822
Rym: This is a very very bad idea and it's something that happens a lot if you spoof the reply headers in An email.

393
00:28:15,266 --> 00:28:19,803
Rym: that is against pretty much every code of conduct and ethics and even some laws on the internet.

394
00:28:19,844 --> 00:28:24,980
Scott: if you do that then pretty much every Email server administrator will be like up blacklist.

395
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,742
Scott: We're done with you.

396
00:28:25,762 --> 00:28:26,645
Scott: Go away.

397
00:28:26,685 --> 00:28:28,230
Scott: We don't want any emails coming from you.

398
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,595
Scott: We don't want to send any emails to you.

399
00:28:29,635 --> 00:28:32,666
Rym: Fuck you, but even beyond that it's also just.

400
00:28:32,787 --> 00:28:33,630
Rym: it's bad practice.

401
00:28:33,691 --> 00:28:49,254
Rym: but it happens a lot too just because people When they follow instructions to set things up with technology a lot of people Don't really read the instructions or don't really understand what they're doing and a lot of people configure routers and switches and things Very badly.

402
00:28:49,274 --> 00:28:54,490
Scott: Well, I think specifically when it comes to email email servers are very hard to set up.

403
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,277
Scott: It's probably the hardest thing to set up there is.

404
00:28:56,397 --> 00:28:57,461
Rym: that's why we use Gmail.

405
00:28:57,481 --> 00:28:59,027
Scott: But anyway, it's like we like Google.

406
00:28:59,047 --> 00:28:59,589
Scott: take care of it.

407
00:28:59,911 --> 00:29:01,402
Rym: Yeah, squirrel mail didn't work.

408
00:29:01,462 --> 00:29:02,510
Rym: So well, no squirrel.

409
00:29:02,551 --> 00:29:03,508
Scott: Well, that's so good.

410
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:17,249
Rym: but a lot of people will set up even like big companies will set up routers and switches and things to send information or broadcast routes or do things to domains or for domains that they do not actually control.

411
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:29,017
Rym: and What happens if someone owns one of those domains because there is a gentleman someone who gets my thumbs up of the day For owning the domain.

412
00:29:29,358 --> 00:29:36,161
Scott: do not reply calm and see I wanted to own them domain test calm But I don't know who had food at bar.

413
00:29:36,181 --> 00:29:37,787
Rym: calm would be pretty good to listen to.

414
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:38,530
Scott: that's a good one.

415
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,437
Scott: There's a lot of.

416
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:42,676
Scott: there's a whole lot of domains That would be really interesting to get.

417
00:29:42,736 --> 00:29:48,689
Scott: just because the a lot of email is sent to those domains You know by people testing shit out.

418
00:29:49,311 --> 00:29:52,240
Rym: but the the person who runs do not reply.

419
00:29:52,420 --> 00:30:04,230
Scott: comm is brilliant because instead of using this for blackmail or Nefarious purpose I would use if I had test calm I'll use it for nefarious purposes Logging into all sorts of people's test development servers and stealing all their code.

420
00:30:04,852 --> 00:30:05,574
Scott: That's what I would do.

421
00:30:05,995 --> 00:30:09,125
Rym: but a lot of scary things get sent to do not reply.

422
00:30:09,305 --> 00:30:09,546
Rym: comm.

423
00:30:09,606 --> 00:30:10,770
Rym: government documents.

424
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:11,332
Rym: There's.

425
00:30:11,633 --> 00:30:15,630
Rym: people are saying that actually some of the WikiLeaks things actually come out from this side.

426
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:18,200
Rym: No, what this guy is like that?

427
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,614
Scott: if that guy, you know, it seems like he's a smart guy I would not be.

428
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:25,980
Scott: it would be very likely that if he finds interesting things He would send them to WikiLeaks.

429
00:30:26,161 --> 00:30:32,350
Rym: quote from slashdot Apparently everyone from major US banks to the TSA to contractors in Iraq.

430
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:40,692
Rym: Use some variation of this address in there from fields for all the emails sent out and all the bounced emails go to this, dude Mm-hmm.

431
00:30:41,254 --> 00:30:47,855
Rym: So he pretty much stopped trying to tell people that happens and now he just posts the interesting ones Mm-hmm.

432
00:30:47,955 --> 00:30:49,462
Rym: So this is my thing of the day.

433
00:30:49,744 --> 00:30:54,783
Rym: My head is off to you, sir And if the government ever shuts you down, it'll be a sad day.

434
00:30:54,803 --> 00:30:56,630
Scott: He's not doing anything illegal.

435
00:30:56,832 --> 00:30:58,568
Scott: I don't think he's doing anything legal at all.

436
00:30:58,851 --> 00:31:04,377
Scott: I don't think someone sent him an email to his domain Even if that was by accident.

437
00:31:04,417 --> 00:31:12,010
Scott: if someone sends me something in the mail with my name on it Even if they you know wrote it wrong, you know, maybe they put the wrong thing in the wrong envelope.

438
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,600
Scott: It's mine tough shit.

439
00:31:14,781 --> 00:31:16,190
Scott: That's yeah, that's the way the law is.

440
00:31:16,612 --> 00:31:19,746
Rym: That's the law with physical mail and if it isn't it should be that way with email.

441
00:31:19,866 --> 00:31:20,590
Rym: I believe it is.

442
00:31:20,954 --> 00:31:27,570
Scott: I'm not a lawyer, you know I know but lawyers are always trying to apply the physical world rules to the to the internet and it usually doesn't work.

443
00:31:27,771 --> 00:31:29,277
Scott: This case it works perfectly.

444
00:31:29,297 --> 00:31:35,302
Rym: you ever get an email where at the end someone has this long boilerplate Like if this message was not intended for you, you must delete it.

445
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:37,330
Rym: You're not allowed to forward this message to anyone.

446
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:37,714
Rym: That's all.

447
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:39,311
Scott: that's complete bullshit Cuz.

448
00:31:39,351 --> 00:31:39,693
Scott: I didn't agree.

449
00:31:39,813 --> 00:31:43,430
Scott: I didn't sign anything to agree to that contract and there's no law backing that up

450
00:31:43,711 --> 00:31:53,950
Rym: because it's the same thing that happens with cease and desist orders where someone will Send a cease and desist and in the cease and desist They'll didn't say that it's illegal for you to post or in any way show anyone the cease and desist.

451
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,059
Scott: Yeah, it's like stuff if you get a piece of paper.

452
00:31:56,139 --> 00:31:58,569
Scott: It's like it says top secret eyes only on it.

453
00:31:59,111 --> 00:32:02,102
Scott: Yeah, that means it's not illegal for you to look at it.

454
00:32:02,163 --> 00:32:05,535
Scott: It's just illegal if you you know, like Complicated.

455
00:32:05,576 --> 00:32:06,770
Rym: Yeah, we're not lawyers.

456
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:10,650
Rym: I'll say this if anyone ever threatens you with something like that call a lawyer.

457
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:14,729
Rym: The lawyer will probably be able to point out that you don't have to do half of what they're.

458
00:32:14,749 --> 00:32:17,290
Scott: well I wouldn't call a lawyer right away cuz that costs money.

459
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,298
Scott: What I would do is I would first call the bluff.

460
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:25,232
Scott: then if they you know, well first blood, you know You're not bluffing but you know be like All right Make me.

461
00:32:25,432 --> 00:32:31,766
Scott: and then if they try to make you then called lawyer because odds are if you just put the slightest bit of resistance They'll just go away and won't come back.

462
00:32:32,931 --> 00:32:33,615
Rym: But uh, yeah.

463
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:34,218
Scott: All right.

464
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,343
Scott: I got a thing of the day here.

465
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:36,388
Scott: Oh, do you?

466
00:32:36,509 --> 00:32:40,930
Scott: yeah Well, you know when you're web browsing, I mean, I know personally at work, right?

467
00:32:41,071 --> 00:32:47,136
Scott: Multiple virtual desktops, right and I got a lot of windows open and I basically have a Firefox window But I'm like every window.

468
00:32:47,156 --> 00:32:49,125
Scott: cuz I'm developing web applications.

469
00:32:49,145 --> 00:32:56,125
Scott: I'm making websites I'm visiting websites to read things but some websites like good my gmail and stuff.

470
00:32:56,166 --> 00:33:22,310
Scott: I just have open all the time and You know, it's sort of annoying because I sort of use my gmail because I mean it is an application like a web application but since it's also a website I Have it open in Firefox like a website and it sort of doesn't mix in with it's like, you know You have the tabs within Firefox to switch sites But then I also have the virtual desktops and the taskbar in my operating system to switch applications.

471
00:33:22,972 --> 00:33:34,890
Scott: So having some of my applications because they happen to be websites in Firefox It's sort of like this dual task switching system that you know, like I'm used to it and it's fine, but it's not.

472
00:33:35,836 --> 00:33:42,949
Scott: It's not correct in a Semantic sort of way if I guess that's the best word I have.

473
00:33:44,312 --> 00:33:48,025
Scott: So Mozilla if you go to their lab site, they're actually working on this thing.

474
00:33:48,065 --> 00:33:54,739
Scott: That looks really cool called Mozilla prism Mozilla prism and Mozilla prism.

475
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:02,270
Scott: basically what it does is you can take any web Site that is an application and turn it into an application.

476
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:10,340
Scott: So for example, I could take mail.google.com, which is Gmail and say hey, yeah Mozilla prism see mail.google.com.

477
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:12,650
Scott: turn that into an application called Gmail.

478
00:34:13,072 --> 00:34:16,466
Scott: It'll make a desktop icon called Gmail with an icon.

479
00:34:16,545 --> 00:34:17,268
Scott: I can click on it.

480
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:23,150
Scott: It'll open up Gmail in its own window as if it were a standalone application.

481
00:34:23,652 --> 00:34:31,409
Scott: I can switch to that application using my standard operating system switching stuff But it doesn't have back or forward or location buttons or anything.

482
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:45,543
Scott: It's just there like, you know an application is and you know, well, I don't think this is like, you know Something you're gonna be replacing your Firefox with because you still need your Firefox for going to the web sites For web applications, especially ones that you keep open a lot.

483
00:34:45,985 --> 00:34:47,090
Scott: I think this is pretty cool.

484
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,356
Scott: I definitely think there's there's something to this here.

485
00:34:49,376 --> 00:34:54,370
Scott: I mean because really it's like, you know, Gmail is an email application.

486
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:59,330
Scott: Why should it be treated in the GUI in the interface any different from you say outlook?

487
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:08,437
Scott: You know just because it happens to be a web application and this sort of breaks that barrier and turns web applications into real Applications in your user interface.

488
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:15,866
Scott: I think that's the way to go and you can actually download this and try this out Which I if you this sounds like something you like go for it.

489
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:16,790
Scott: It's pretty cool.

490
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:17,489
Scott: Yeah, I like it.

491
00:35:17,852 --> 00:35:28,318
Rym: but anyway to get on to our main bit here as you know Scott and I are kind of Alternating between his field of expertise in my field of expertise, you know IT and CS and it's my turn this week.

492
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,807
Rym: I had a kind of long rambling.

493
00:35:30,827 --> 00:35:31,710
Rym: I was tired.

494
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:40,409
Rym: I wanted to eat overview of what IT was and We realized pretty much right away that in order to actually talk about IT I have to break it down into all these tiny little pieces and talk about them.

495
00:35:40,611 --> 00:35:40,731
Rym: Yeah,

496
00:35:40,751 --> 00:35:57,417
Scott: I sort of realized after last my last week's episode just kind of Blair You know, it's like on the one hand I want to break stuff up in the way that I know it But on the other hand if I break it up that way a lot of the episodes are gonna be uninteresting or Boring or unhelpful.

497
00:35:57,458 --> 00:36:12,110
Scott: So as we start out to find a balance between talking about something that people want to know and want to hear and entertaining but also the you know, the Foundation information that sort of we feel needs to be known even if people don't want to know it and it's tough.

498
00:36:12,832 --> 00:36:28,948
Rym: So I'm gonna start tonight by talking about one very important piece of IT and luckily It's something that you can probably all relate to because pretty much that the part the IT that the majority of human beings will ever directly interact with is the help desk

499
00:36:29,553 --> 00:36:30,418
Scott: The

500
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:31,041
Rym: help desk.

501
00:36:31,081 --> 00:36:36,650
Rym: now there are a lot of ways to define help desk But I'm gonna use a somewhat broad definition that I think serves my purposes very well.

502
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:44,715
Rym: helpdesk is the interface between IT professionals and IT services and End users.

503
00:36:45,158 --> 00:36:47,550
Rym: now end user does not mean non-technical user.

504
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,315
Rym: I mean Here's two examples of a helpdesk.

505
00:36:49,817 --> 00:36:54,994
Rym: one you work at your job and you use the computer and you print to a printer and the Printer stops working.

506
00:36:55,415 --> 00:36:59,089
Rym: you call the helpdesk and say hey the printers broken and someone comes and fix it.

507
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:06,489
Rym: so or let's say you work for a major ISP and One of your ds3 circuits goes down.

508
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:15,196
Rym: So you call the helpdesk at Verizon or XO or whoever and say hey My ds3 is down fix it you assholes Mm-hmm.

509
00:37:15,721 --> 00:37:16,429
Scott: So, you know, what if?

510
00:37:17,451 --> 00:37:17,773
Scott: How about?

511
00:37:17,793 --> 00:37:21,610
Scott: the ones were like I buy a Dell and the Dell doesn't work and I got is that a help desk?

512
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,140
Scott: Does that count or is that like the customer service line?

513
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,330
Scott: is that there's a tech support different than out desk?

514
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:34,030
Rym: It's tricky actually that the customer support and help desk are interrelated in a lot of companies But they don't necessarily have to be interrelated.

515
00:37:34,471 --> 00:37:46,070
Rym: So I'm gonna take a kind of I'm gonna make up an example company that happens to provide Every possible kind of service in the world and talk about all the different aspects of their help desk and/or customer support.

516
00:37:46,372 --> 00:37:48,329
Rym: All right, that's pretty much the easiest way to go about it.

517
00:37:48,671 --> 00:37:55,669
Rym: I want to preface this by saying that this does not represent any Particular company that I may or may not have worked at in any way as you see here.

518
00:37:56,631 --> 00:37:57,454
Rym: Actually, it really doesn't.

519
00:37:57,534 --> 00:37:59,040
Scott: I'm just I'm saying as you see.

520
00:37:59,180 --> 00:37:59,662
Rym: Yes, I do.

521
00:38:00,003 --> 00:38:01,770
Rym: I don't have to say that just because of the.

522
00:38:03,812 --> 00:38:05,629
Rym: There's also a bunch of other organizations.

523
00:38:06,126 --> 00:38:09,070
Rym: Oh God you know.

524
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:14,469
Rym: Actually, I'm gonna try to get permission from my company to do a show on how the stupid financial stock markets and everything work.

525
00:38:15,212 --> 00:38:20,030
Rym: It's actually really fascinating, but I gotta actually ask permission before I could talk about it in any depth.

526
00:38:20,251 --> 00:38:23,669
Scott: It's a lot like the grocery market only with a lot more money and a lot less food.

527
00:38:26,277 --> 00:38:26,830
Rym: But anyway.

528
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:32,326
Rym: So you got a company and you've got employees who do the business to the core business.

529
00:38:32,346 --> 00:38:40,550
Rym: because remember every every company Every profitable company at least I'm not gonna ignore cases like I don't know SEO where there was no core business.

530
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,897
Rym: But in most companies, there's a core business.

531
00:38:42,957 --> 00:38:45,545
Rym: the thing the company does the thing.

532
00:38:45,585 --> 00:38:48,475
Rym: the company makes its money with Selling snake oil.

533
00:38:48,796 --> 00:38:57,414
Rym: the reason the company exists like IBM has a lot of them but like Joey Jojo's tomato stand his core business is Tomatoes.

534
00:38:57,676 --> 00:38:59,870
Rym: he makes his money selling tomatoes.

535
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:05,710
Rym: Everything else in his business is nothing more than supporting the business of selling tomatoes.

536
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:09,650
Scott: Yeah, he has a cash register, but that's really just there to help him sell tomatoes.

537
00:39:09,751 --> 00:39:12,650
Scott: He has a truck but that's really just there to help him move tomatoes.

538
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:19,250
Rym: He has his data center and his Oracle database and his 4ds threes and that's just to help him count how many tomatoes he sold.

539
00:39:19,993 --> 00:39:22,786
Rym: You do you or do you not deny that this shit be banging.

540
00:39:22,806 --> 00:39:23,510
Scott: this should be banging.

541
00:39:25,371 --> 00:39:29,190
Rym: But you really have to understand like in any company, what is the core business?

542
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:36,210
Rym: And this is something that a lot of computer professionals and technology professionals kind of lose sight of especially in smaller companies.

543
00:39:36,571 --> 00:39:47,809
Rym: It's very easy when you're the tech guy in a company to feel like you are the company and know in the end The core business is the company and you exist solely to make sure that its core business keeps going.

544
00:39:48,613 --> 00:39:53,675
Rym: So different aspects of a helpdesk, let's start on the very broadest level What Scott was talking about.

545
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:58,910
Rym: there is of course customer support which may or may not be IT and may or may not be help desk.

546
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:03,010
Rym: Let's call this the tier one of help desk or tier one of support.

547
00:40:03,812 --> 00:40:09,925
Rym: These are typically be completely non technical people who deal with core business problems.

548
00:40:10,246 --> 00:40:11,990
Rym: a customer has a problem.

549
00:40:12,351 --> 00:40:17,010
Rym: They are calling your core business because they have a problem and you need to resolve it.

550
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:20,029
Rym: So they will continue to send you money in return for goods and services.

551
00:40:20,773 --> 00:40:39,029
Rym: So usually what you have are people who are either Minimum wage grunts or if your company is actually high class or high scale or for whatever reason You might actually have like public relations or consumer relations professionals But regardless there is some sort of interface between the customer and the company.

552
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:40,936
Scott: So that should be so.

553
00:40:41,578 --> 00:40:47,930
Scott: really someone calling Dell with a problem with their computer Isn't really sort of an IT help desk situation?

554
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:51,950
Scott: It's the same as if they were calling Joe's tomato stand with a problem about tomatoes.

555
00:40:52,431 --> 00:40:59,434
Rym: Yes, but it can become an IT or a help desk situation because of something a concept called Escalation.

556
00:40:59,474 --> 00:40:59,776
Scott: Uh-huh.

557
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:02,591
Rym: Now, so let's say we've got this tier one, you know Someone?

558
00:41:02,913 --> 00:41:07,610
Rym: I'm Joey Jojo's tomato stand and a customer calls and they've got a problem.

559
00:41:07,752 --> 00:41:08,889
Rym: I don't know what their problem is.

560
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:09,934
Rym: So I have a generic number.

561
00:41:10,074 --> 00:41:16,560
Rym: any customer can call and the customer says I tried to buy Tomatoes and I was unable to do so.

562
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:16,640
Rym: Hmm.

563
00:41:17,584 --> 00:41:19,190
Rym: Well, how did you try to buy them?

564
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:25,067
Scott: They collect information and once they collect I put some money in Joe's pocket, but he didn't give me any tomatoes.

565
00:41:25,448 --> 00:41:28,809
Rym: that asshole I screamed at my computer and tomatoes didn't come out.

566
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,205
Scott: You have to wait for them to show up in the mail.

567
00:41:32,245 --> 00:41:36,490
Scott: that man You're not responsible for mushiness.

568
00:41:36,972 --> 00:41:40,603
Rym: So this customer support person will follow up some rules.

569
00:41:40,683 --> 00:41:46,283
Rym: is there some sort of way they have to determine Where the problem is and they may solve the problem on their own.

570
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:48,070
Rym: They might say oh, well, do you have an account?

571
00:41:48,532 --> 00:41:52,150
Rym: Blah blah blah, but the problem might be a technological problem.

572
00:41:52,653 --> 00:41:55,589
Rym: And if it is then it gets referred to the help desk.

573
00:41:56,273 --> 00:41:59,950
Rym: Now the help desk or IT is still a very multifaceted thing.

574
00:42:00,372 --> 00:42:07,721
Rym: But the way most help desks would be set up is that now if it's an IT problem They would escalate it to either IT, but we'll just call it tier two.

575
00:42:07,741 --> 00:42:10,190
Rym: We're gonna ignore everything that isn't an IT problem.

576
00:42:10,935 --> 00:42:15,463
Rym: So say the problem was the customer Couldn't make the order because they could like.

577
00:42:15,483 --> 00:42:16,730
Rym: the website wouldn't work for them.

578
00:42:17,132 --> 00:42:19,308
Rym: The customer support person isn't going to know anything about that.

579
00:42:19,811 --> 00:42:21,759
Rym: So they escalate it to the tier two.

580
00:42:21,799 --> 00:42:24,489
Rym: support the lowest level of IT support.

581
00:42:24,549 --> 00:42:28,390
Rym: now If a company has a core business that is technology.

582
00:42:28,992 --> 00:42:31,478
Rym: That level is usually the first level you reach.

583
00:42:31,939 --> 00:42:36,150
Rym: like if you call Comcast my cables out you pretty much reach this level immediately.

584
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:41,850
Scott: Well, the the the first level if you call Comcast would usually be there's a problem with your bill.

585
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:45,990
Rym: There's a problem, you know, usually the first level is press one if you have a billing problem.

586
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,639
Rym: Well, yes to to report a service.

587
00:42:47,861 --> 00:42:49,369
Rym: Yeah, it would be the tier one support.

588
00:42:49,891 --> 00:42:51,838
Rym: You can automate tier one support in most cases.

589
00:42:51,978 --> 00:42:53,844
Rym: Mm-hmm, but we're gonna skip over that.

590
00:42:53,864 --> 00:42:56,161
Rym: I could do a Thursday show on that business Mm-hmm.

591
00:42:56,670 --> 00:43:17,400
Rym: so these people are kind of like the lowest level of support for external customers and they will try to get enough information to Determine if one is a problem they can solve or two if they need to escalate it either further up the chain or sideways into different components or aspects of your IT help desk infrastructure or Organization depending on how complex you are.

592
00:43:17,942 --> 00:43:19,990
Rym: So say you call and he says can't get to the website.

593
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:26,634
Rym: So they escalate to tier two the IT help desk and they say that you type in the URL and the guy says yeah What'd you type in?

594
00:43:26,674 --> 00:43:27,397
Rym: I typed in this.

595
00:43:27,418 --> 00:43:28,663
Rym: All right, looks like it's working.

596
00:43:28,684 --> 00:43:33,160
Rym: Yeah, I get some SSL error SSL error you say and then you're looking.

597
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:33,782
Rym: Oh, wow.

598
00:43:34,243 --> 00:43:36,350
Rym: No one's been able to get to our website for a while.

599
00:43:37,411 --> 00:43:45,590
Rym: So then you escalate to the tier three or the developers or the support, you know some sort of specialized or higher-level group.

600
00:43:46,132 --> 00:43:51,430
Rym: Because like we got a friend who works a help desk and there's different levels and different jobs.

601
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:57,369
Rym: So if I'm a mot like an early entry-level Lowly paid like I just got my foot in the door.

602
00:43:57,972 --> 00:44:07,427
Rym: I answer the calls from stupid people and or I answer the calls that are simple and if it's a problem that's complex I forward it up to the higher paid people who are more specialized.

603
00:44:07,748 --> 00:44:13,529
Rym: because you if you have someone who is being paid a lot their time is worth X dollars per hour.

604
00:44:13,549 --> 00:44:23,610
Rym: if They have to answer every call that gets sent into a help desk no matter how easy It'll probably answer a lot of them really quickly and really easily and really awesomely.

605
00:44:23,951 --> 00:44:27,663
Rym: But at the same time it's not worth the money it costs to keep them around.

606
00:44:27,683 --> 00:44:29,750
Rym: They should be doing better things for your business.

607
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:33,810
Scott: Yeah, I mean a person with those skills could be doing other things that make mad monies.

608
00:44:34,251 --> 00:44:34,693
Scott: They're not.

609
00:44:34,813 --> 00:44:39,290
Scott: you know, your business isn't that much better because they answered a bunch of phone calls.

610
00:44:39,611 --> 00:44:57,886
Rym: So theoretically you hire people who can do the blood just what is required at the lower levels and pay them less Because someone who's paid $20 an hour spending four hours working on a problem is a lot cheaper than making the person who's paid $120 an hour even read that email.

611
00:44:58,289 --> 00:45:08,210
Rym: Yep Now don't read from this that low-level tech people are stupid because actually Most low-level tech people that you call are fully qualified to do a lot more.

612
00:45:08,692 --> 00:45:16,627
Rym: They just for various reasons are because of the IT industry are working at that lower level And they just don't have access to the actual decision-making thing.

613
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:17,230
Rym: That's a whole other.

614
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:19,770
Scott: Yeah, I mean that said that's a completely separate issue.

615
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:23,143
Scott: I mean look at all the people with like college degrees working you like Home Depot.

616
00:45:23,184 --> 00:45:23,525
Scott: It's like.

617
00:45:23,967 --> 00:45:24,770
Scott: that's that issue.

618
00:45:24,871 --> 00:45:27,628
Rym: I think yeah, but theoretically in a nutshell.

619
00:45:27,668 --> 00:45:30,998
Rym: now What you do is an IT helpdesk.

620
00:45:31,259 --> 00:45:44,750
Rym: goal is to get a customer who has a problem Figure out at what level that problem needs to be solved Direct it to the level where it can be solved that person solves it and then direct the solution back to the customer.

621
00:45:45,432 --> 00:45:47,481
Rym: Now that's for external customers.

622
00:45:47,521 --> 00:45:49,570
Rym: But why would it be any different for an internal customer?

623
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:59,230
Rym: It's not if I and it isn't if I've got a prod work for Joey Jojo's shack and I Manage the database server that keeps track of all of his multinational tomato orders.

624
00:45:59,933 --> 00:46:07,470
Rym: So if I have a problem with my PC, all right, I'm a tech professional I work with the database server, but my job is the database server.

625
00:46:07,771 --> 00:46:11,382
Rym: I'm being paid eight thousand dollars a minute to make that database server go.

626
00:46:11,402 --> 00:46:14,968
Rym: if my computer blue screens one day And I can't make it boot?

627
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:22,810
Rym: What's more worthwhile for me to spend my eight thousand dollar a minute time going to Microsoft's website and?

628
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:24,837
Scott: Reinstalling windows, I mean cuz.

629
00:46:24,857 --> 00:46:25,881
Scott: he knows how to do that.

630
00:46:25,921 --> 00:46:28,410
Scott: He said, you know, he knows so much about computers.

631
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:29,695
Scott: He's a database manager.

632
00:46:30,036 --> 00:46:33,128
Scott: He could fix his own computer, but that's not his job.

633
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:36,144
Rym: like Scott Scott could fix his own computer at his company.

634
00:46:36,184 --> 00:46:38,859
Scott: Sometimes I do Sometimes I don't.

635
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,852
Scott: sometimes I say you fix it It's your job.

636
00:46:40,872 --> 00:46:45,790
Rym: now the scale and scope of these operations really depends on how big your company is.

637
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:50,604
Rym: If you only have four employees like us now, then people can fix their own stuff.

638
00:46:50,664 --> 00:46:52,048
Rym: or maybe you have one IT guy.

639
00:46:52,671 --> 00:47:00,787
Rym: But if you've got a hundred employees It's probably worth your while to have some sort of dedicated help desk staff to deal with all these problems.

640
00:47:00,828 --> 00:47:06,490
Rym: now even though Help desk is a cost center in that halt the help desk will never make money.

641
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:09,524
Rym: In fact help desk can only cost money.

642
00:47:09,584 --> 00:47:10,729
Rym: it can never make money.

643
00:47:11,251 --> 00:47:28,950
Rym: But what it can do is reduce operating costs and give you a net Like benefit as in it technically cost you twenty thousand dollars a year to maintain this help desk But in the end it saved you $40,000 worth of people who are more important time resolving simple issues.

644
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:34,570
Scott: Yeah, cuz think about this fixing up a broken computer a broken Windows computer pretty easy.

645
00:47:34,951 --> 00:47:37,401
Scott: Someone who's not that awesome can probably take care of it.

646
00:47:37,442 --> 00:47:39,510
Scott: They can be awesome, but they don't to be that awesome.

647
00:47:39,692 --> 00:47:43,272
Scott: Okay, so let's say you have a hundred awesome Programmers.

648
00:47:43,753 --> 00:47:45,158
Scott: one of their computers breaks.

649
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,650
Scott: Do you want them to fix the computer or do you want the not?

650
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:52,630
Scott: Not as awesome guy to fix the computer you just have one spare computer.

651
00:47:53,051 --> 00:47:59,130
Scott: They programmers can all be programming all the time and one guy goes around making sure all the computers work all the time.

652
00:47:59,412 --> 00:48:00,946
Scott: You get a lot more programming done now.

653
00:48:01,836 --> 00:48:02,929
Rym: I've already gone on a little long.

654
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:04,901
Rym: Yep Cuz I don't want to go into a lot more detail.

655
00:48:04,921 --> 00:48:06,410
Rym: cuz I think you've got the gist of it now.

656
00:48:06,733 --> 00:48:13,049
Rym: What a help desk is what it should do But I want to give you a little bit of nuts and bolts as to how help desk should be set up.

657
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:13,553
Rym: now I could.

658
00:48:13,614 --> 00:48:20,930
Rym: I'm gonna do whole shows in the future on How to actually set up a help desk and the differences like network operations and production support.

659
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:21,432
Scott: That's it.

660
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:31,059
Scott: If you ever go and you see like, you know tech people calling up because they have a problem They always say give me the knock Operation Center, that's what they're all grumpy.

661
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:31,742
Scott: Give me the knock.

662
00:48:31,963 --> 00:48:33,230
Scott: I don't want to talk to you morons.

663
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:41,202
Rym: Yeah And those are like the places that have the big screen with like the picture of the network and it's all green and red And then alerts are coming in and all the cool stuff.

664
00:48:41,242 --> 00:48:42,589
Scott: They really exist those places.

665
00:48:42,689 --> 00:48:43,171
Rym: Yes I have.

666
00:48:43,252 --> 00:48:50,098
Rym: actually every company I've worked for has had one and in fact now I kind of sit in one Mmm, and actually IBM's was the coolest.

667
00:48:50,399 --> 00:48:56,317
Rym: but it was the coolest because it was so old school Looked like some Apollo action.

668
00:48:56,378 --> 00:48:57,724
Rym: No, it looked like I don't know.

669
00:48:57,744 --> 00:48:59,070
Rym: It looked like a cold war scene.

670
00:49:00,172 --> 00:49:02,522
Rym: It felt like I could launch nuclear missiles from that place.

671
00:49:02,542 --> 00:49:03,185
Rym: war games.

672
00:49:03,346 --> 00:49:04,390
Rym: It was also fortified.

673
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:07,444
Rym: I don't think I could express to you how cool it was to be in the knock at.

674
00:49:07,485 --> 00:49:08,630
Scott: IBM should take a picture.

675
00:49:09,233 --> 00:49:11,806
Rym: I got some pictures, but I can't legally show them to anyone.

676
00:49:11,847 --> 00:49:12,389
Scott: That's not cool.

677
00:49:13,131 --> 00:49:16,625
Scott: If I was IBM, I'd want to show it off like check out our cool cold war.

678
00:49:16,665 --> 00:49:18,635
Rym: not know because you'd all go Wow, that's cool.

679
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:22,181
Rym: But IT people would go Wow Yeah.

680
00:49:24,091 --> 00:49:57,450
Rym: Anyway, I don't want to make fun of IBM too much but My advice to anyone who is managing a help desk or is at a company where there is a help desk or anything even a small company pretty much you want to formalize the processes of a help desk as Early as possible and in fact in general you want to err on the side of overkill because the more informal your processes Are the more completely fucked you are if your organization ever gets bigger or if anyone ever gets fired or leaves or retires?

681
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:06,005
Rym: It might seem onerous to have like this formal ticketing system where like say at GeekNights Like Scott has a problem with an episode.

682
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:06,729
Rym: that sounds funny.

683
00:50:07,051 --> 00:50:16,550
Rym: so he goes to the thing and he makes a ticket with a number and he assigns it to me and I open that ticket and I resolve it and I log my solution and then maybe I can't fix it because it's a Libsyn problem.

684
00:50:17,052 --> 00:50:25,890
Rym: So I escalated to Libsyn and I give them a ticket number and they come back to me with that ticket number once they've solved It and then I de-escalate back down to Scott and he approves my solution.

685
00:50:26,435 --> 00:50:32,210
Rym: That might seem like a lot of red tape But you know what if you don't set up at least basic structures like that early on?

686
00:50:32,651 --> 00:50:35,018
Rym: You're so screwed if you ever get bigger like.

687
00:50:35,078 --> 00:50:46,150
Rym: I can't even express to you how many IT companies that are very large have Inadequate business structures for their help disk and as a result spend so much money trying to rectify that.

688
00:50:46,913 --> 00:50:48,750
Rym: I could do a whole show about it and I probably will.

689
00:50:49,064 --> 00:50:56,169
Scott: Yeah It's easy to set up a system when there's only a few people and that's usually why no one sets up a system because you only have a few people.

690
00:50:56,189 --> 00:50:57,114
Scott: what do You need a system for?

691
00:50:57,275 --> 00:51:00,110
Scott: you can just talk and that it works with only a few people.

692
00:51:00,553 --> 00:51:02,970
Scott: But it's easy to set up a system with a few people.

693
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:07,170
Scott: It's hard to set up a system with a lot of people and if you have a lot of people you need a system.

694
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:19,341
Scott: so the only way to make things work is either to spend a lot of money and have a pain in the ass or Set up a system when you're small then get big and keep the system and then you won't have to spend a lot of money Or have a pain in the ass

695
00:51:19,664 --> 00:51:20,350
Rym: in the future.

696
00:51:20,431 --> 00:51:22,210
Rym: I'll go into a lot of detail about all of that.

697
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:29,848
Rym: I got a bunch of episodes planned about like knocks and network operations and all those sorts of things But I think that's enough for tonight.

698
00:51:36,202 --> 00:51:38,812
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
