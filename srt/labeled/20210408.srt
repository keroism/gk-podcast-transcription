1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,088
Rym: It's April 8th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,088 --> 00:00:09,390
Rym: I'm Brim.

3
00:00:12,123 --> 00:00:12,620
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,106
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:16,980
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about scarcity.

6
00:00:19,022 --> 00:00:20,038
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:29,739
Rym: So, you might recall, back on Thursday, April 11th, 2019, we did an episode of GeekNights that's relevant to this.

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,120
Rym: But I was working, like, working from home, doing my thing, and our doorbell rang.

9
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:41,540
Rym: That's super weird, 'cause one, even in non-COVID times, this is a building with, like, a doorman.

10
00:00:41,921 --> 00:00:45,979
Rym: Like, there's someone at the front desk that won't let people in, unless they're, like, allowed to come in.

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,060
Rym: Like, no one would knock on our door unless we knew they were coming.

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,860
Scott: Sometimes the door person will wave through, like, a delivery person, and they'll ring the doorbell.

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,900
Scott: 'Cause I didn't, you know, it happens.

14
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:57,680
Rym: Yeah, our building's pretty good about that.

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,299
Scott: Sometimes the door person's not there.

16
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:08,480
Rym: Actually, I asked him one time, because I've noticed that, like, you and all of our close friends who come over often never get it hassled, but anyone else gets hassled.

17
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,350
Rym: They do, like, remember everyone.

18
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,960
Rym: Like, it's amazing that they do this.

19
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:15,680
Scott: If you sit there bored at a desk all day, all you can do is look at people.

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,754
Rym: Yep, look at people and look at your screen.

21
00:01:17,794 --> 00:01:18,480
Rym: Like, that's all you got.

22
00:01:19,042 --> 00:01:20,070
Scott: You remember people.

23
00:01:20,211 --> 00:01:21,360
Scott: That's how it is.

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,538
Rym: The dude doing the night shift is super cool, 'cause he's definitely just like, "I'm gonna sit here, play video games, 99% of the time, I don't have to do anything

25
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:28,759
Rym: else.".

26
00:01:29,482 --> 00:01:30,072
Rym: And then, 1% of the time.

27
00:01:32,222 --> 00:01:38,120
Scott: I'll bike to work, and there'll be someone that I'll see for, like, one second, like, while I'm crossing the bridge.

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,071
Scott: And if I just see that person, it's one second.

29
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:42,573
Scott: I see them.

30
00:01:42,593 --> 00:01:45,060
Scott: Like, I see them come, or maybe a handful of seconds.

31
00:01:45,201 --> 00:01:45,929
Rym: I know that feeling.

32
00:01:46,151 --> 00:01:47,100
Rym: I know that exact feeling.

33
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,600
Scott: But you see that you don't know them, you never talk to them, you don't know anything about them.

34
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,680
Scott: You just see their face in the same place a few times, right?

35
00:01:57,162 --> 00:01:58,268
Scott: You know, it doesn't need to be daily.

36
00:01:58,308 --> 00:01:59,495
Scott: It could be, like, maybe once a week.

37
00:01:59,515 --> 00:02:00,500
Scott: you see them, right?

38
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,259
Scott: And it's like, you remember that person now.

39
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:10,880
Rym: There's a set of people like that that I just would, like, see on the 7 train, like, multiple times a week, 'cause we have very similar schedules.

40
00:02:11,262 --> 00:02:13,598
Rym: And it was very clear that they also see me the same way.

41
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:19,320
Rym: Like, more frequent eye contacts with those people, followed by looking away.

42
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:24,840
Scott: Someone I see on the subway platform once in a while, 'cause we, you know, go to work at the same time.

43
00:02:24,981 --> 00:02:27,034
Scott: It's like, eventually you're sort of, it's that person.

44
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,693
Rym: The listener in the stream was like, "You didn't say the

45
00:02:30,754 --> 00:02:31,035
Rym: day!".

46
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:37,840
Rym: So anyway, our doorbell rings, so we go to answer it, and it's one of the maintenance people.

47
00:02:38,843 --> 00:02:41,100
Rym: And they say something- Was there water in the ceiling again?

48
00:02:41,302 --> 00:02:42,839
Rym: Ah, there was water in the ceiling again!

49
00:02:44,201 --> 00:02:52,980
Rym: What they said was one of the most unnerving things that a maintenance person can ask you if you live in a high-rise in New York City.

50
00:02:53,422 --> 00:02:56,060
Rym: Are you having any flooding problems?

51
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,187
Scott: Yep.

52
00:02:58,382 --> 00:03:00,738
Rym: I think that's second only to, "Have you seen the

53
00:03:00,798 --> 00:03:01,060
Rym: rat?".

54
00:03:03,703 --> 00:03:04,670
Rym: So, we're like,

55
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,040
Rym: "Nooo."

56
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:08,956
Rym: Followed by, "Let's check the apartment in

57
00:03:08,996 --> 00:03:09,359
Rym: detail.".

58
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:13,180
Rym: And he comes in with us, and sure enough, there's no flood in our apartment.

59
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,780
Rym: The downstairs has a big flood.

60
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:25,420
Rym: And he found, in the closet in this room, in the back of it, if you put your ear up against the wall, there's a very slow and steady drip.

61
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,900
Scott: So the dripping was going between your walls, but not hitting your apartment.

62
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,280
Rym: Yep, like it was bouncing off some studs inside the wall, but it wasn't like touching our drywall or getting into our apartment.

63
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,837
Rym: And then, so basically he was like, "Okay, I'm gonna continue this investigation

64
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:41,500
Rym: upward.".

65
00:03:42,242 --> 00:03:47,259
Rym: And we were like, "Yeah, if this gets louder at any point, we will come find you and let you

66
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:47,420
Rym: know.".

67
00:03:47,581 --> 00:03:48,168
Rym: And he was like, "Thank

68
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:48,310
Rym: you.".

69
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:51,979
Rym: And it's still dripping right now, but it's not a problem for me.

70
00:03:53,063 --> 00:03:54,120
Scott: Well, not a problem for you yet.

71
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,419
Rym: It has not changed in cadence in any way.

72
00:03:58,842 --> 00:04:00,340
Rym: Like, it has not gotten louder at all.

73
00:04:01,647 --> 00:04:01,733
Scott: Okay.

74
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,563
Scott: Yeah, we'll see.

75
00:04:03,006 --> 00:04:03,348
Rym: We'll see.

76
00:04:03,388 --> 00:04:05,300
Rym: So that was a momentary fun.

77
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,680
Rym: When he asked that question, I had that sinking feeling.

78
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,300
Rym: Because this building is a history of floods.

79
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,197
Rym: As we've talked about so many times that we did an episode on it.

80
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:18,014
Scott: Almost everyone's got a water in the ceiling story.

81
00:04:18,055 --> 00:04:18,839
Scott: It's just so common.

82
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,940
Rym: So in the news, this is an American political news that is actually a moderately big deal.

83
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:36,200
Rym: Because as you are painfully aware, no matter where you live in the world, if you're online at all, you know that America, unique among nations, has a gun problem.

84
00:04:37,021 --> 00:04:37,476
Scott: You don't say.

85
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:48,320
Rym: There are other countries that have gun problems, but America's gun problem is so unique in that we could end it almost instantly if we had even the most minimal will to do so.

86
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:57,959
Rym: And yet, a near majority of Americans desperately do not want to solve this problem and actively prevent us from taking even the most minimal steps.

87
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,580
Rym: And there's a lot of political reasons why we're like, generally the Congress has to deal with that kind of thing.

88
00:05:04,982 --> 00:05:07,899
Rym: There's very relatively limited things like a president could do.

89
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:18,760
Rym: And the notable news is that our president, Joe Biden, did today actually announce something that Obama had avoided doing and tried to rely on Congress.

90
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:25,760
Rym: Biden and the Democrats have definitely shifted now in this current post-the-former-guy political climate.

91
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,600
Rym: Post, wow, waiting for Congress literally just cannot solve anything.

92
00:05:30,202 --> 00:05:34,240
Rym: They're starting to do the things that they can do without our Congress's permission.

93
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:38,120
Rym: That we're seen as like things you shouldn't do in the past.

94
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,240
Rym: They're starting to do them, which is a little glimmer of hope.

95
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:43,039
Scott: Anything you have the power to do.

96
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:43,740
Scott: You should do.

97
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:53,380
Rym: So there are going to be some executive orders to do some gun control things that the president legally can do without any approval from Congress.

98
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:54,488
Rym: They could just do it.

99
00:05:55,052 --> 00:05:56,119
Rym: And he's doing them.

100
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,648
Rym: That, I think, it's not the big like.

101
00:05:58,728 --> 00:06:03,340
Rym: the big news is that they're doing something with that power as opposed to nothing.

102
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:07,680
Rym: That is possibly a transformative step in American politics.

103
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,720
Rym: I am cautiously optimistic because you can imagine why.

104
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:23,540
Rym: But this is worth paying attention to, especially because despite the fact that in terms of our political system, the slight majority of people running our government are very pro-gun.

105
00:06:24,241 --> 00:06:30,680
Rym: If you actually poll American people, like 75% of Americans want to have massive gun control.

106
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,380
Rym: But that is not reflected in our government at all.

107
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:36,699
Rym: I'm not going to dwell on this.

108
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,560
Scott: We vote, but it's not a Democratic vote where one person gets one vote.

109
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,580
Rym: America's democracy is deeply undemocratic.

110
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:46,940
Rym: And this is a very important good step.

111
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:48,639
Rym: This does not solve this problem.

112
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:53,440
Rym: But this is a meaningful step that is actually happening for real.

113
00:06:53,641 --> 00:06:56,880
Rym: And I think that tiny victory is worth a tiny amount of celebration.

114
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:05,720
Rym: However, at the same time, there have been, I believe, 21 mass shootings since the Georgia mass shooting.

115
00:07:06,662 --> 00:07:11,840
Rym: And there was a mass shooting during the announcement about this gun control thing.

116
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:13,595
Rym: And it's so...

117
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,671
Scott: You knew there was going to be.

118
00:07:15,691 --> 00:07:16,660
Scott: You had to see that coming.

119
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:22,480
Rym: But it just made me realize how little I even notice when there are mass shootings in America.

120
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:30,280
Scott: Well, because it's now like car accidents where it's killing tens of thousands, you know, how many piles of human beings, right?

121
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,020
Scott: But it becomes so commonplace that the media stops talking about it.

122
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,820
Scott: So unless it happens right next to you where you can see it, it's not a thing for you.

123
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,540
Rym: So actually, that's an interesting thing, because during COVID, we can't do things.

124
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,780
Rym: So we have that car at least for COVID.

125
00:07:46,121 --> 00:07:51,740
Rym: So every weekend before it got cold, we would drive upstate and hike in the wilderness alone and then come back home.

126
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:52,959
Rym: So we didn't like contact people.

127
00:07:53,701 --> 00:08:01,440
Rym: And on the way home, I'd say 75, 80 percent of the time there'd be a big traffic pileup because of a fatal accident.

128
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:09,260
Rym: Because on those roads coming into New York from the north, there's on average, last I checked, like a fatal accident, like one per day, I think was the stat.

129
00:08:09,481 --> 00:08:11,539
Rym: Like just on this tiny set of roads.

130
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,400
Rym: But and that's a terrifying statistic.

131
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:24,920
Rym: Imagine if there was just some nutbag with a gun sitting on like the FTR drive and every day he got to shoot someone and no one had like no one did anything about this.

132
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,800
Scott: Yeah, if you kill someone with someone killed someone with a car in Brooklyn today and they just got away with it.

133
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,780
Scott: There's almost never consequences.

134
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,304
Scott: Nothing's going to happen.

135
00:08:32,586 --> 00:08:34,499
Scott: There's no consequences because they did it with a car.

136
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,960
Rym: So and I like, you know, us like we're super mad about cars.

137
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,592
Scott: And if I kill someone with a gun by accident, get the cut, they're going to.

138
00:08:41,712 --> 00:08:43,260
Scott: even the cops are going to do something about it.

139
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,015
Scott: Even though I'm a white guy.

140
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:44,720
Rym: Yup.

141
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:53,873
Rym: But so doing that drive every day, like even though I'm already super mad about cars and the damage cars do, it really made it visceral.

142
00:08:54,554 --> 00:08:57,900
Rym: how many fatal accidents I saw with my own eyes.

143
00:08:58,421 --> 00:09:04,901
Rym: Because up until this point, like I don't have I haven't had a car since 2008 and a half, like mid 2009.

144
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:06,239
Rym: I didn't have a car that worked anymore.

145
00:09:07,862 --> 00:09:11,080
Rym: And as soon as I have a car again and I drive here, I see a fatal accident.

146
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:14,859
Rym: On average, 75 to 80 percent of the times I drive that car.

147
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:24,020
Scott: I don't you know, if I knew how to make people value human life, that was not the human life of someone that is them or someone they know.

148
00:09:25,384 --> 00:09:26,047
Scott: I would do it.

149
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,660
Scott: But some people value it and some people don't.

150
00:09:29,261 --> 00:09:31,551
Rym: What's the quote that I use so often that like?

151
00:09:31,611 --> 00:09:33,660
Rym: it's just like it expresses this so well.

152
00:09:34,123 --> 00:09:36,519
Rym: I don't know how to explain to you to care about other people.

153
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:46,000
Rym: It's like, well, but the extra tragedy of this mass shooting is that it was a former former NFL player.

154
00:09:47,381 --> 00:10:02,800
Rym: And there is a high likelihood this overlaps with CTE and the damage that comes from people playing football and the Venn diagram of easy access to guns that America is just a broken country for so many reasons.

155
00:10:03,565 --> 00:10:04,291
Scott: Everybody knows it.

156
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:05,360
Scott: That's not news.

157
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,782
Rym: Yep.

158
00:10:06,802 --> 00:10:15,240
Rym: I hope this does spur more conversation about football, because CTE is also something that we are not addressing in sports.

159
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,272
Rym: Like hockey is doing like babies first changes.

160
00:10:18,573 --> 00:10:20,100
Rym: Football is doing basically nothing.

161
00:10:23,545 --> 00:10:25,732
Rym: Yeah, that's that's all my depressing news.

162
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,160
Rym: I started with, hey, maybe there's a sliver of hope.

163
00:10:29,843 --> 00:10:33,090
Scott: I mean, you know, that's the reasons the country is in.

164
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:37,920
Scott: the pooper are still true, even though the president has changed.

165
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:41,008
Rym: And I think it just comes down to our democracy.

166
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:43,940
Scott: None of those things are new, but it doesn't hurt to repeat them.

167
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,445
Rym: It doesn't hurt to repeat them because we can't forget.

168
00:10:46,505 --> 00:10:52,339
Rym: We can't get complacent and just say, well, that's just how it is, because if we do get to that point, it'll literally always be that way.

169
00:10:53,243 --> 00:10:57,179
Scott: Yeah, that's, you know, repeating them is definitely something you got to do.

170
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,860
Rym: Just to remember, but also don't repeat them so much that you lose sight of when we do get make things slightly better.

171
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:07,380
Rym: Like, don't go into a nihilistic death spiral either.

172
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:14,460
Scott: I mean, New York State, New York State officially declared that gun violence is a public health crisis.

173
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:21,040
Scott: I don't know what that official declaration will result in, but it's also, I guess, good, right?

174
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,540
Rym: Yeah, because New York could start passing more and more restrictive gun controls in the state and then there'll be court battles and everything.

175
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:33,780
Scott: And also the, you know, there was all those laws like, you know, the CDC can't research guns or whatever as a health crisis.

176
00:11:33,921 --> 00:11:35,190
Scott: But now that's gone right there.

177
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,560
Scott: They are doing that research now.

178
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,362
Scott: Exactly.

179
00:11:37,884 --> 00:11:40,980
Rym: So I guess the moral of all that news is celebrate victories.

180
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,600
Rym: Don't forget shit still fucked, but don't like don't get stuck believing that shit will always be fucked.

181
00:11:47,361 --> 00:11:47,582
Rym: Yet.

182
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:52,920
Rym: If we get to the point to where this is unresolvable, this is a very, GeekNights becomes a very different thing.

183
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,026
Scott: It is a thing, right?

184
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:56,780
Scott: So it's tough to think about will shit always be fucked?

185
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,115
Scott: Because if you, you know, on the one hand, you got those people, right?

186
00:12:01,176 --> 00:12:02,340
Scott: The Bill Gates type people.

187
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:07,320
Scott: And insufferable ones who were like, look, you know, look at the course of human history.

188
00:12:07,441 --> 00:12:09,698
Scott: Things are always getting better, right?

189
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:16,100
Scott: Even though there's bad things and downturns in the short term, over the long term, everything always gets better.

190
00:12:16,261 --> 00:12:20,160
Rym: But fuck you, one of those downturns was World War Two and the genocide.

191
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,161
Scott: Right.

192
00:12:21,181 --> 00:12:21,362
Scott: Right.

193
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:27,840
Scott: It's like and, you know, but also those upturns are only including, you know, certain people.

194
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,320
Rym: Well, those upturns leave a lot of people behind.

195
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:31,762
Scott: Exactly.

196
00:12:31,882 --> 00:12:32,082
Scott: Right.

197
00:12:32,423 --> 00:12:33,425
Scott: So there's those people.

198
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:40,620
Scott: But then there's also people who are like, hey, look, you can look at any point in human history, which isn't that old, actually.

199
00:12:41,704 --> 00:12:42,289
Rym: Yeah.

200
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,540
Rym: 40,000ish years is like it.

201
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,344
Scott: Whatever scale you're using.

202
00:12:45,705 --> 00:12:52,340
Scott: But in terms of human civilization, there has never been a time where shit wasn't fucked the fuck up.

203
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,080
Scott: Yeah.

204
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:53,402
Scott: Right.

205
00:12:53,723 --> 00:12:55,328
Scott: You pick any pick any year.

206
00:12:55,349 --> 00:12:58,279
Scott: Oh, there was shit that was fucked the fuck up.

207
00:12:58,359 --> 00:12:58,540
Scott: Right.

208
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:05,473
Rym: Watch, some day some research is going to find that there was like one day in like 411 A.D.

209
00:13:05,813 --> 00:13:09,340
Rym: where like nothing significantly bad happened and everyone had a good day.

210
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,501
Rym: Right.

211
00:13:10,683 --> 00:13:12,159
Rym: Like literally every human on Earth.

212
00:13:13,203 --> 00:13:15,248
Scott: But then the third the third thing.

213
00:13:15,689 --> 00:13:15,970
Scott: Right.

214
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,857
Scott: Is that like, look, you know, you're zooming out like that.

215
00:13:18,877 --> 00:13:19,840
Scott: You're looking at everyone.

216
00:13:20,421 --> 00:13:22,425
Scott: You're looking at certain peoples here and there.

217
00:13:22,505 --> 00:13:22,705
Scott: Right.

218
00:13:22,766 --> 00:13:29,580
Scott: But there are if you combine places and times and you zoom in.

219
00:13:30,361 --> 00:13:30,602
Scott: Right.

220
00:13:31,203 --> 00:13:36,438
Scott: You can find right places where people are living and there's nothing got.

221
00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:37,200
Scott: everything is great.

222
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:38,185
Rym: Yep.

223
00:13:38,205 --> 00:13:41,160
Scott: And there might be bad shit happening in the world at that moment.

224
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,421
Rym: Yep.

225
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:58,240
Scott: But so if it's possible for some people in some places and sometimes to, you know, not have awful lives of horrors occurring, then it should be possible to just extend that to all the places.

226
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,764
Scott: We can't extend it to the past.

227
00:14:00,004 --> 00:14:00,245
Rym: Yep.

228
00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:02,872
Rym: But we can extend it to all the places.

229
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:05,800
Rym: Take that zoomed in camera and zoom it out a little bit further.

230
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,322
Rym: Right.

231
00:14:06,442 --> 00:14:12,140
Scott: If we can extend it to all places in the present, because we only can do anything in the present, you can't do anything in the right.

232
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:13,142
Scott: Yeah.

233
00:14:13,162 --> 00:14:17,674
Scott: Then, you know, it should be possible to make things better.

234
00:14:18,155 --> 00:14:19,780
Scott: But we also never have.

235
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,160
Rym: Yeah.

236
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,729
Rym: But I guess the last point there and we can move on is the the the course of things over the longest scale.

237
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:32,436
Rym: generally getting better is the result of a lot of hard work to like.

238
00:14:32,477 --> 00:14:33,898
Rym: we can't pretend that that just happens.

239
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:35,020
Rym: naturally because.

240
00:14:35,861 --> 00:14:41,390
Scott: But also, you know, I think it's tough because when you say, OK, things getting better.

241
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:41,670
Scott: Right.

242
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:47,960
Scott: It's like, well, almost all of the things you would think of as getting better, like, oh, we invented medicine.

243
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:49,583
Scott: How did you manage that?

244
00:14:49,664 --> 00:14:50,365
Rym: Yeah.

245
00:14:50,385 --> 00:14:52,549
Scott: By causing harm elsewhere.

246
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:53,251
Scott: That's how.

247
00:14:53,431 --> 00:14:53,792
Scott: Right.

248
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:56,357
Rym: But then we made medicine less harmful to make.

249
00:14:56,377 --> 00:14:57,680
Rym: Right.

250
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,665
Scott: It's like, oh, you got, you know, what was that?

251
00:15:00,786 --> 00:15:05,815
Rym: one dude who was like, hey, I solved the problem of car engines breaking.

252
00:15:06,195 --> 00:15:07,097
Rym: I put lead in there.

253
00:15:07,137 --> 00:15:07,898
Rym: That'll be fine.

254
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:08,780
Rym: Oh, no.

255
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,122
Rym: Same motherfucker.

256
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:12,566
Rym: Hey, I invented something that makes refrigerators work.

257
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:13,067
Rym: Oh, no.

258
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:18,477
Scott: How'd you get all the resources to build that amazing stuff and do all the research?

259
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:19,760
Scott: by colonizing people?

260
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,502
Scott: You know, rare earth metals.

261
00:15:21,782 --> 00:15:22,984
Rym: Oh, they're rare, you say.

262
00:15:23,004 --> 00:15:25,046
Rym: Oh, and they underpin our entire society.

263
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:25,747
Rym: Mm hmm.

264
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:27,549
Rym: Right.

265
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,553
Scott: You know, all the pluses are just someone else.

266
00:15:30,573 --> 00:15:31,434
Scott: You know, where are?

267
00:15:31,534 --> 00:15:34,297
Scott: how many things are just a plus across the board?

268
00:15:34,357 --> 00:15:34,598
Scott: Right.

269
00:15:34,678 --> 00:15:35,499
Scott: Not not enough.

270
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,480
Scott: Not many.

271
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,882
Rym: So I got one really tiny news.

272
00:15:37,922 --> 00:15:38,543
Rym: Then let's go.

273
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,346
Rym: Let's go out on a nicer note.

274
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:44,593
Rym: This would be a Tuesday news, but I think it's worth talking about the Super Mario Brothers.

275
00:15:44,814 --> 00:15:48,460
Rym: one speed run world record was just broken.

276
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,105
Scott: It's hard to believe because I saw that I watched the video of the previous breakage.

277
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:53,706
Scott: Right.

278
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,007
Scott: And it was like, really?

279
00:15:55,027 --> 00:15:56,709
Scott: How are you going to improve on that?

280
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,130
Scott: Right.

281
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:11,068
Rym: And the answer was going after this one person went after like an extremely difficult maneuver that is frame perfect and sub pixel perfect timing in one part at the very end of the game.

282
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:14,793
Rym: And if you mess that up, the whole runs worthless.

283
00:16:14,853 --> 00:16:15,333
Rym: Just give up.

284
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:15,774
Rym: Try again.

285
00:16:15,794 --> 00:16:16,615
Rym: Start over immediately.

286
00:16:16,635 --> 00:16:17,777
Rym: Yeah.

287
00:16:17,797 --> 00:16:18,958
Scott: I mean, luckily, it's a short.

288
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:19,679
Scott: it's a short run.

289
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:20,380
Rym: Four minutes.

290
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,042
Rym: Fifty four seconds.

291
00:16:22,342 --> 00:16:22,503
Rym: Right.

292
00:16:22,543 --> 00:16:22,963
Rym: Nine hundred.

293
00:16:23,003 --> 00:16:23,584
Scott: It's not like.

294
00:16:23,704 --> 00:16:26,207
Scott: it's not like you spent 30 minutes and then failed.

295
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:28,730
Scott: If four minutes and then a failure, you could you know, you could do.

296
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:33,296
Rym: I don't know how those like Final Fantasy speed runners like or like Chrono Trigger speed runners like.

297
00:16:33,356 --> 00:16:33,656
Rym: All right.

298
00:16:33,937 --> 00:16:35,378
Rym: Six hours into my run up.

299
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:36,620
Rym: Start over.

300
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,221
Rym: I forgot to cry.

301
00:16:38,281 --> 00:16:39,843
Scott: I don't know how either kind does it.

302
00:16:39,863 --> 00:16:39,964
Scott: Right.

303
00:16:39,984 --> 00:16:43,648
Scott: Because even if it's a short run, it's like, OK, I could do a few runs, but then I get bored.

304
00:16:43,688 --> 00:16:47,053
Scott: I couldn't put in the thousand runs necessary to own it perfectly.

305
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:48,434
Scott: You know what I do?

306
00:16:48,454 --> 00:16:52,820
Scott: You don't have to be as perfect on the long runs because it's so long.

307
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,283
Scott: But at the same time, I can.

308
00:16:55,323 --> 00:16:56,344
Scott: it's so long I can play.

309
00:16:56,364 --> 00:16:58,666
Scott: I can't beat Final Fantasy anything one time.

310
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:00,988
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

311
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:06,634
Rym: imagine instead of going to work every day, you just beat Chrono Trigger once every day.

312
00:17:06,753 --> 00:17:07,115
Scott: Can't be?

313
00:17:07,355 --> 00:17:11,920
Scott: I couldn't beat Chrono Trigger in a day, even if I woke up and started immediately and didn't eat.

314
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:20,288
Rym: Anyway, the reason I'm making this news now is if you are not listening to like Tuesday gaming, you don't care about games, whatever, like just watch this video.

315
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:21,388
Rym: This is amazing.

316
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:29,898
Rym: Even if you have no idea what a video game is like, this is a an amazing human feats that is worth watching for anyone.

317
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,759
Rym: That's all I got on that.

318
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,962
Scott: In some news slash thing of the day combo.

319
00:17:37,002 --> 00:17:38,864
Scott: So I guess it's good to end the news with it.

320
00:17:38,964 --> 00:17:39,164
Scott: Right.

321
00:17:39,204 --> 00:17:39,964
Scott: And it's somewhat old.

322
00:17:39,984 --> 00:17:41,586
Scott: It's like a few weeks old, maybe.

323
00:17:42,446 --> 00:17:43,327
Scott: But the Louvre.

324
00:17:43,587 --> 00:17:43,787
Scott: Right.

325
00:17:43,827 --> 00:17:50,332
Scott: Talking about, you know, colonizing because everyone's locked inside.

326
00:17:50,472 --> 00:17:53,534
Scott: And I think, you know, I don't know, is the Louvre renovating again or it's closed.

327
00:17:53,554 --> 00:17:54,094
Scott: I don't know.

328
00:17:54,154 --> 00:17:58,697
Rym: But anyway, Paris, I never because I knew someday I'd want to go back with Emily.

329
00:17:59,018 --> 00:18:02,280
Rym: I didn't go into any museums or like anything anytime I've ever been there.

330
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,401
Scott: I just just go again.

331
00:18:05,602 --> 00:18:12,107
Rym: Well, partly because I was busy, like I could basically mostly only do a lot of stuff in the evening and at night when those all those things close way early in Paris.

332
00:18:12,787 --> 00:18:13,267
Scott: Oh, of course.

333
00:18:13,287 --> 00:18:13,448
Scott: Yeah.

334
00:18:13,928 --> 00:18:23,094
Scott: But anyway, the Louvre has digitized and uploaded over four hundred and eighty two thousand works of art from their archives.

335
00:18:23,114 --> 00:18:28,518
Scott: You can just go to the Web site and, you know, explore the Louvre digitally.

336
00:18:28,658 --> 00:18:29,779
Rym: Oh, it's even got a map.

337
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:30,960
Rym: You just got to walk around it.

338
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,241
Rym: Oh, yeah.

339
00:18:32,261 --> 00:18:33,021
Scott: They got everything.

340
00:18:34,022 --> 00:18:38,045
Scott: But it helps to be able to write in French to use this.

341
00:18:39,906 --> 00:18:43,429
Scott: I didn't really you know, if you want to search for something right, you probably have to look real.

342
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:44,710
Rym: What the hell is that?

343
00:18:48,673 --> 00:18:49,173
Scott: Exactly.

344
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:51,014
Scott: You can probably eat with a little Google Translate.

345
00:18:51,034 --> 00:18:56,478
Scott: You can probably find the thing you're looking for or just if you're not looking for any particular thing, it won't matter as much.

346
00:18:56,538 --> 00:18:58,620
Rym: I feel like I'm just going to wander around this thing.

347
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:03,844
Scott: I feel like archive dot org needs to, you know, download this whole thing really quickly.

348
00:19:03,904 --> 00:19:04,044
Scott: Right.

349
00:19:04,064 --> 00:19:07,226
Scott: Who knows how long it's going to be there, how well they're going to maintain it, et cetera.

350
00:19:07,266 --> 00:19:13,090
Scott: But this is now like a great treasure of humanity that this exists.

351
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,211
Scott: So that's that's pretty good.

352
00:19:14,531 --> 00:19:14,732
Scott: Right.

353
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:15,572
Rym: Yeah.

354
00:19:15,592 --> 00:19:16,853
Rym: That's actually super cool.

355
00:19:16,913 --> 00:19:26,280
Rym: that especially because of our topic for the main bit around scarcity and how this is an example of reducing scarcity just improves the world for everyone.

356
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,182
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

357
00:19:34,262 --> 00:19:36,384
Rym: So there was a boat drama recently.

358
00:19:36,964 --> 00:19:38,185
Rym: And this is a little thing.

359
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:39,946
Scott: My thing is the one where the boat got stuck.

360
00:19:40,006 --> 00:19:40,186
Scott: Yeah.

361
00:19:40,206 --> 00:19:41,167
Rym: The one where the boat got stuck.

362
00:19:41,828 --> 00:19:43,829
Rym: God, that already feels like it was a long time ago.

363
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,631
Scott: Fucking it's somewhat recent still.

364
00:19:46,671 --> 00:19:49,253
Rym: Yeah, it's recent, but it feels longer ago than it was.

365
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,414
Rym: Anyway, this is a page.

366
00:19:51,855 --> 00:19:57,799
Rym: This is the kind of stuff that I am like weirdly into in my life when I want to go on a like a Wikipedia binge.

367
00:19:57,859 --> 00:19:59,640
Rym: Like this is the type of shit I'm into.

368
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,741
Rym: Like weird infrastructure.

369
00:20:01,181 --> 00:20:11,368
Rym: This actually breaks down for transporting things on boats, in planes, in cars, in trucks, all trains, all the ways we transport things.

370
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:15,851
Rym: What are all the different kinds of standard shipping containers and what are they used for?

371
00:20:16,391 --> 00:20:16,832
Rym: And it's just.

372
00:20:17,372 --> 00:20:18,253
Rym: it was fascinating.

373
00:20:18,373 --> 00:20:22,896
Rym: I learned a lot from this relatively short page and there's pictures of all of them.

374
00:20:24,177 --> 00:20:27,039
Rym: Like, I don't even want to try to explain any of this to you.

375
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:29,140
Rym: Like just you will enjoy reading this page.

376
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,764
Rym: It'll take you about 10 minutes, maybe.

377
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:32,908
Rym: And you're going to learn a lot of interesting stuff.

378
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:38,200
Rym: And if you want to learn more, I guarantee this is a rabbit hole that could consume the rest of your life.

379
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:39,420
Scott: Hmm.

380
00:20:40,742 --> 00:20:41,042
Scott: All right.

381
00:20:41,062 --> 00:20:44,427
Scott: So this would normally be like a Monday thing of the day, but I want to branch out a little bit.

382
00:20:44,527 --> 00:20:48,853
Scott: So if, you know, there's the Web, which is HTTP, right?

383
00:20:48,893 --> 00:20:51,877
Scott: You send an HTTP request to a Web server.

384
00:20:51,997 --> 00:20:54,000
Scott: They send you back HTML, JavaScript.

385
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,962
Rym: Send me the resource at that URI.

386
00:20:57,622 --> 00:21:00,865
Scott: And then your browser does all sorts of stuff with HTML, right?

387
00:21:02,185 --> 00:21:04,787
Scott: Back in the day, there are lots of other protocols out there.

388
00:21:05,228 --> 00:21:09,570
Scott: One of another popular one from the past that is still semi barely alive is Gopher.

389
00:21:09,751 --> 00:21:09,991
Scott: Right.

390
00:21:10,711 --> 00:21:11,692
Scott: You've probably heard of that one.

391
00:21:12,232 --> 00:21:19,177
Scott: Well, there's a semi recent ish one that I've learned about that is more active than you would think.

392
00:21:19,357 --> 00:21:21,318
Scott: And its activity is increasing.

393
00:21:21,358 --> 00:21:23,780
Scott: It's obviously still vanishingly small.

394
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,621
Scott: Yeah, but it is on the rise.

395
00:21:25,782 --> 00:21:27,583
Scott: And it's called Gemini Project.

396
00:21:27,623 --> 00:21:30,926
Scott: Gemini named after the space project, but not the space project.

397
00:21:30,966 --> 00:21:35,050
Scott: It's kind of hard to Google for because the space project keeps showing up every time.

398
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:42,656
Scott: And basically, it's sort of they're saying they're not looking to replace HTTP or Gopher.

399
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:43,517
Scott: Right.

400
00:21:43,577 --> 00:21:46,960
Scott: They're simply looking to be a third thing that exists on its own.

401
00:21:47,781 --> 00:21:57,208
Scott: And the way it works is basically pretty similar to, you know, HTTP, but very, very limited.

402
00:21:57,428 --> 00:21:57,668
Scott: Right.

403
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:58,949
Scott: You make a request.

404
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,712
Scott: It sends you back not HTML, but the sort of markdown format.

405
00:22:04,213 --> 00:22:08,096
Scott: And basically, that doesn't tell there's no scripts that can be sent to you.

406
00:22:08,796 --> 00:22:13,680
Scott: And there's no basically no scripts.

407
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,661
Rym: Well, they actually so they list styling.

408
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:20,445
Rym: They actually on the page, their overview really explains that so succinctly.

409
00:22:20,805 --> 00:22:21,885
Rym: It's heavier than Gopher.

410
00:22:22,446 --> 00:22:24,207
Rym: It's lighter than HTTP.

411
00:22:24,627 --> 00:22:25,848
Rym: It will not replace either.

412
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:28,050
Rym: It strives for a power to weight ratio.

413
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,490
Rym: That's good.

414
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,691
Rym: And it takes user privacy seriously.

415
00:22:31,312 --> 00:22:32,453
Scott: There's no cookies.

416
00:22:32,993 --> 00:22:35,795
Scott: There's no way if you want to log into something.

417
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:36,155
Scott: Right.

418
00:22:36,175 --> 00:22:38,497
Scott: If you don't have like a login, the way it works is you make.

419
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:41,078
Scott: HTTP actually supports this, but no one uses it.

420
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:43,340
Scott: You make like a key.

421
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,361
Scott: Like a client key.

422
00:22:45,982 --> 00:22:46,302
Scott: Right.

423
00:22:46,462 --> 00:22:47,543
Scott: And you use keys.

424
00:22:47,563 --> 00:22:50,725
Scott: You don't use, you know, passwords or anything.

425
00:22:50,765 --> 00:22:54,388
Scott: I guess you could, but it wouldn't work really well because there's no cookies or anything.

426
00:22:54,448 --> 00:22:54,688
Scott: Right.

427
00:22:54,868 --> 00:22:57,290
Scott: There's no way to track anybody on this.

428
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,911
Scott: Right.

429
00:23:00,032 --> 00:23:00,612
Scott: And it's super.

430
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,054
Scott: it's super fast, obviously, because you're just sending texts.

431
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:03,554
Scott: Right.

432
00:23:03,574 --> 00:23:04,935
Scott: You're not sending a pile of files.

433
00:23:05,435 --> 00:23:10,419
Scott: You could download files over it, you know, like image file or whatever, but it's kind of not great for that.

434
00:23:10,579 --> 00:23:12,020
Scott: So you'll probably use something else.

435
00:23:13,681 --> 00:23:18,224
Scott: But, yeah, this is this is maybe once I update the GeekNights' website in HTTP.

436
00:23:18,365 --> 00:23:27,572
Scott: I would like to have a Gemini like make a Gemini version so you could browse the front row crew dot com on Gemini and, you know, get through all our content.

437
00:23:27,732 --> 00:23:32,816
Scott: It'll probably be the fastest, most convenient way to get through the content, even though I'll make a really nice HTTP.

438
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:37,340
Rym: I realize unless we're this is a Monday show and we spent some time on it.

439
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:44,965
Rym: It's hard to articulate to a non-technical person who doesn't know how the Web works, like in detail, what like why this is so interesting.

440
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:46,766
Scott: Try all you it's.

441
00:23:46,906 --> 00:23:47,146
Scott: Yeah.

442
00:23:47,247 --> 00:23:47,827
Scott: You're basically.

443
00:23:48,087 --> 00:23:53,631
Scott: you can try this very easily if you just go to the website, you can download your choice of a browser.

444
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:54,011
Scott: Right.

445
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,752
Scott: Basically a Firefox equivalent.

446
00:23:56,173 --> 00:23:56,593
Scott: But it won't.

447
00:23:56,693 --> 00:23:58,514
Scott: it'll be a Gemini thing and not a right.

448
00:23:58,914 --> 00:24:01,336
Scott: And you'll go to a page and you'll it's.

449
00:24:01,716 --> 00:24:03,197
Scott: it'll be completely familiar to you.

450
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:07,340
Scott: It'll just be basically like looking at Web pages that are all text and really fast.

451
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:07,900
Rym: It would be.

452
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:14,785
Rym: I guess the best way I would describe it is it would be a lot like how the early Web worked for real.

453
00:24:16,226 --> 00:24:21,970
Scott: Yeah, before, you know, you could put a tiled background or because the way the early Web worked was naming head type.

454
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,593
Rym: You type in some sort of UI to get a resource.

455
00:24:26,073 --> 00:24:30,916
Rym: And that resource was just content that was marked up so you could display it any way you wanted.

456
00:24:31,277 --> 00:24:34,339
Rym: And it gave you a way to from that resource link to other resources.

457
00:24:34,939 --> 00:24:35,740
Rym: That was pretty much it.

458
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,423
Rym: Most of the stuff you do with the Web today is way beyond that.

459
00:24:41,324 --> 00:24:43,385
Scott: So I'm a. I'm a kind of a fan of this.

460
00:24:43,626 --> 00:24:46,748
Rym: I'm a big fan of this because this is I like hoping people.

461
00:24:46,808 --> 00:24:48,689
Scott: I'm hoping it continues to rise.

462
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:50,831
Scott: I think people put stuff on here.

463
00:24:50,871 --> 00:24:53,172
Scott: I think eventually we'll do a full show on it.

464
00:24:53,273 --> 00:25:01,539
Rym: I think the stuff that is best to put here are like data sets, blog type things, Wikipedia type things.

465
00:25:02,499 --> 00:25:03,360
Scott: I would love to see people.

466
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:17,229
Scott: I would love to see people just scrape and or hook up to Web APIs and create Gemini facing user interfaces for them.

467
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:20,151
Scott: So it's like you want to search Twitter dot com.

468
00:25:20,431 --> 00:25:20,671
Scott: Right.

469
00:25:20,872 --> 00:25:22,733
Scott: Someone hooked up to the Twitter API.

470
00:25:22,753 --> 00:25:24,034
Scott: You go to Gemini something.

471
00:25:24,494 --> 00:25:27,396
Scott: You know, you type in your search query and now you're searching Twitter.

472
00:25:27,416 --> 00:25:28,357
Scott: But you're on Gemini.

473
00:25:28,377 --> 00:25:28,957
Scott: You're not using.

474
00:25:29,257 --> 00:25:30,818
Scott: you're not looking up to Twitter directly.

475
00:25:31,219 --> 00:25:31,539
Scott: Right.

476
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,380
Scott: Their server is sort of a go between.

477
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,222
Scott: Gemini on one end, Twitter API on the other end.

478
00:25:36,282 --> 00:25:42,987
Rym: It's like a lightweight way to interface with APIs and data sets, but without all the shit that comes along with the current World Wide Web.

479
00:25:43,887 --> 00:25:44,067
Scott: Yep.

480
00:25:44,447 --> 00:25:46,729
Scott: Someone go take an open database.

481
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:47,089
Scott: Right.

482
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:48,871
Scott: And just create a Gemini interface for it.

483
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:51,692
Rym: And then I guess where I struggled is when I was going to try to explain it.

484
00:25:52,053 --> 00:26:00,939
Rym: I was actually going to explain gopher, but I don't think anyone listening to GeekNights has ever actually used gopher while they say they're not out to replace gopher.

485
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:02,820
Scott: I feel like it replace gopher.

486
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:07,203
Rym: I mean, gopher technically still works, but are there any gopher people?

487
00:26:07,303 --> 00:26:07,783
Scott: People use it.

488
00:26:07,803 --> 00:26:09,004
Scott: Yeah, it's not much.

489
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:10,085
Scott: It's really, really tiny.

490
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:11,146
Scott: But there are people that use it.

491
00:26:11,346 --> 00:26:12,126
Rym: Yeah, it does.

492
00:26:12,146 --> 00:26:12,286
Rym: Yeah.

493
00:26:12,306 --> 00:26:13,968
Scott: But I guess people still use news groups.

494
00:26:14,108 --> 00:26:15,068
Scott: People still use IRC.

495
00:26:15,088 --> 00:26:18,891
Rym: People see, you know, if I point like chrome at a gopher, you are.

496
00:26:18,991 --> 00:26:19,972
Rym: I guess that'll work.

497
00:26:20,392 --> 00:26:23,154
Scott: I don't know if chrome will do it, but yeah, that's what I don't know.

498
00:26:23,234 --> 00:26:25,595
Rym: I haven't thought about gopher until it might.

499
00:26:25,636 --> 00:26:29,678
Scott: It might do it, but there are definitely plenty of applications that will do it.

500
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:32,220
Rym: Anyway, it's kind of moot because gopher actually was too limiting.

501
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,021
Rym: And there's a lot of problems with gopher.

502
00:26:34,462 --> 00:26:36,983
Rym: Gopher serves a more narrow focus, I think.

503
00:26:38,504 --> 00:26:38,784
Scott: Anyway.

504
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:45,869
Rym: Anyway, so in the moment, reading the tale of Genji again, I slowed down a little bit just because it got really nice out.

505
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:49,432
Rym: But now it's getting nice enough out to where I can sit in the park and just read.

506
00:26:49,872 --> 00:26:53,054
Rym: So I think I'm actually going to accelerate my tale of Genji over the next.

507
00:26:53,354 --> 00:26:54,835
Scott: I better also accelerate then.

508
00:26:54,995 --> 00:26:59,779
Rym: I think like by like over this weekend, I'm going to accelerate rapidly, but we'll see.

509
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:01,900
Rym: I'll warn you if I don't accelerate rapidly.

510
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,924
Scott: What's killing me lately is like at work, I'm actually doing some fucking work.

511
00:27:07,405 --> 00:27:08,946
Scott: So welcome.

512
00:27:09,287 --> 00:27:10,348
Rym: Welcome to that world.

513
00:27:11,068 --> 00:27:11,989
Scott: Yeah, it's not.

514
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:12,990
Scott: It's not often, right?

515
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:14,972
Scott: It's mostly I don't have more work.

516
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:19,116
Scott: It's just I got a particular item of work that is time consuming, right?

517
00:27:19,136 --> 00:27:22,900
Scott: So once I can finish it, then I'll be back to normal, you know, barely work.

518
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,962
Rym: It's interesting because I got the same thing, but it's more.

519
00:27:25,522 --> 00:27:33,270
Rym: my work requires a lot of mental energy now, way more than any job I've ever had did, even though the actual work to do is not that hard.

520
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:36,773
Rym: The mental energy of deciding what to do and just dealing with it all is a lot.

521
00:27:36,793 --> 00:27:37,674
Rym: Just roll a die.

522
00:27:37,734 --> 00:27:38,295
Scott: Just pick one.

523
00:27:38,755 --> 00:27:43,460
Rym: Yeah, that has drastic and possibly world affecting consequences for some of these things.

524
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,641
Scott: You get paid the other way, right?

525
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:47,981
Scott: Yeah.

526
00:27:48,262 --> 00:27:57,148
Rym: But I'm also increasingly dealing with like more management type stuff, which just introduces a whole human factor, an emotional labor factor that I've really never had to deal with in my life.

527
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,330
Scott: I don't want to do that.

528
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:04,573
Rym: My life up to this point has been here are tasks and things to deal with, deal with them.

529
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:06,295
Rym: And it's never like had to get above.

530
00:28:06,315 --> 00:28:06,795
Scott: That's my life.

531
00:28:06,815 --> 00:28:06,955
Scott: Yeah.

532
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:10,898
Scott: I mean, my management style is basically you're working.

533
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:12,939
Scott: I expect you to be competent and to know what to do.

534
00:28:12,979 --> 00:28:13,780
Scott: What are you coming to me for?

535
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,821
Scott: That's my manager, right?

536
00:28:16,101 --> 00:28:18,943
Scott: That's why I'm not managing anybody.

537
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:22,946
Scott: Are you telling me you don't know what you should be doing and you don't know how to do it?

538
00:28:23,046 --> 00:28:24,447
Scott: Why are you hired?

539
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:37,237
Rym: People only come to me when there is a mutually exclusive decision to be made that the existing framework I've set up for making that decision does not address it or where there's disagreement because maybe I didn't know something.

540
00:28:37,937 --> 00:28:41,780
Rym: And as a result, something is blocked and I have to make decision of how to proceed.

541
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:52,860
Rym: Anyway, so I only have to deal with the edge cases, which means every time I talk to someone, it's always something contentious and difficult, because if it was not contentious and difficult, no one needs to bother me.

542
00:28:53,820 --> 00:29:00,933
Scott: Well, anyway, just in case this is the first time the listener has ever heard of us for some reason, they ended up hearing this.

543
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:03,899
Rym: I don't know how we're two white guys doing a podcast like that's.

544
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:04,620
Rym: that's novel.

545
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:05,402
Scott: Why are you?

546
00:29:05,483 --> 00:29:06,125
Scott: Why are you here?

547
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:06,726
Scott: Go away.

548
00:29:06,827 --> 00:29:11,080
Scott: But if you're here and for some reason you want more of that because the Internet doesn't have enough of that.

549
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,083
Rym: Guess what?

550
00:29:12,144 --> 00:29:14,640
Rym: There are over 1400 episodes of this online for free.

551
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:23,800
Scott: Not only do we have a website, we have an email address, we have Twitter, we have several Twitter accounts, YouTube accounts, we got a Discord, we have an old forum that's an archive mode and a new form.

552
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:29,097
Scott: We're on Spotify, iTunes, Amazon podcast, Google podcast, fucking LinkedIn Rym.

553
00:29:29,117 --> 00:29:29,820
Scott: put a thing there.

554
00:29:30,361 --> 00:29:33,269
Scott: We got a. we got a steam group with a curator page.

555
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,513
Scott: We're on board game geek.

556
00:29:34,754 --> 00:29:36,760
Scott: We got we got a subreddit no one uses.

557
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:39,466
Scott: We got Twitch channels that don't get used that much.

558
00:29:39,546 --> 00:29:41,711
Scott: But, you know, we got an Instagram that doesn't get used.

559
00:29:41,731 --> 00:29:42,733
Scott: We got a Patreon.

560
00:29:42,753 --> 00:29:45,620
Scott: We got we are on every even on stupid Facebook.

561
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,604
Scott: We're thinking about deleting that.

562
00:29:47,106 --> 00:29:49,317
Scott: I've been thinking about deleting it for how many years I haven't deleted it.

563
00:29:51,261 --> 00:29:53,527
Scott: But, yeah, we got a newsletter, email newsletter.

564
00:29:53,728 --> 00:29:56,956
Scott: It's like we are on every place on the Internet.

565
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:58,280
Scott: We put our stuff up there.

566
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,695
Scott: If you know any places I've asked this in our Discord.

567
00:30:01,755 --> 00:30:02,760
Scott: No one had any good ideas.

568
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:04,624
Rym: What did I add?

569
00:30:04,664 --> 00:30:08,079
Rym: I added the Amazon fashion page and I added the page so far.

570
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:09,661
Scott: Yeah, we could.

571
00:30:09,721 --> 00:30:12,772
Scott: someone suggested Snapchat, but I don't really know what we would do with that.

572
00:30:13,314 --> 00:30:14,458
Scott: Someone suggested parlor.

573
00:30:14,498 --> 00:30:15,020
Scott: That was funny.

574
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:17,506
Scott: Someone's only fans Rym.

575
00:30:17,586 --> 00:30:18,028
Scott: You could do that.

576
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:18,891
Scott: You don't like wearing clothes.

577
00:30:19,212 --> 00:30:20,055
Rym: Only fans could be fun.

578
00:30:20,095 --> 00:30:21,380
Rym: Only fans doesn't have to be pornographic.

579
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,146
Rym: You could just be like, hey, it doesn't have to be.

580
00:30:23,206 --> 00:30:24,973
Rym: But, you know, anyway, hey, you want to.

581
00:30:24,993 --> 00:30:26,660
Rym: you want to pay to have a conversation with Rym?

582
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:29,227
Rym: I feel like you won't do that a second time.

583
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:30,230
Scott: Yeah.

584
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:30,772
Scott: There's also on.

585
00:30:30,973 --> 00:30:33,200
Scott: Discord recently added this stage functionality.

586
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,410
Scott: We might be using that in the future for our live stuff.

587
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:37,931
Rym: Yeah.

588
00:30:37,971 --> 00:30:41,080
Scott: So join our Discord because it really suits our model.

589
00:30:41,581 --> 00:30:43,084
Scott: And especially once they add video to it.

590
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:45,408
Rym: And what I will say, I'll say this now.

591
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:51,540
Rym: Way back in the day, we talked about, and we talked about it kind of publicly, occasionally doing call-in shows.

592
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,474
Rym: That was actually originally one of the ideas for what Friday GeekNights would have been.

593
00:30:55,494 --> 00:30:57,140
Rym: You know why we didn't do a Friday GeekNights?

594
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:04,040
Rym: Because doing a podcast five days a week was way, way too much compared to four in terms of having a life.

595
00:31:05,082 --> 00:31:07,227
Rym: And don't worry, we're not going to do the Friday GeekNights.

596
00:31:07,287 --> 00:31:11,977
Rym: But call-in shows, we came up with a whole pipeline on how to do them and they were a giant pain in the ass.

597
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:12,900
Rym: That's why we never did them.

598
00:31:14,341 --> 00:31:18,417
Rym: That Discord stage opens the door to occasionally doing a call-in segment.

599
00:31:18,517 --> 00:31:19,240
Rym: And I think that could be fun.

600
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,407
Scott: It also makes it a lot easier to do guest shows.

601
00:31:21,527 --> 00:31:23,313
Rym: Yeah, like doing a guest interview.

602
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:25,420
Rym: We could do a live stream of that guest interview.

603
00:31:26,461 --> 00:31:31,240
Rym: You should see the hurdles we go through to record an interview, especially during COVID times.

604
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,442
Scott: That's why we don't do it that often.

605
00:31:33,705 --> 00:31:36,170
Scott: That we might do it more often once it becomes easier.

606
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:41,000
Scott: So yeah, come to all the places we are on the internet to find us if you really want to.

607
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:44,619
Scott: And also, tell us places on the internet that we're not there so we can be there.

608
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:47,229
Rym: Yeah, unless they're bad places.

609
00:31:47,611 --> 00:31:48,940
Rym: There'll never be a GeekNights gab.

610
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,844
Scott: Yeah, of course.

611
00:31:51,165 --> 00:31:51,707
Rym: Of course not.

612
00:31:51,747 --> 00:31:52,450
Rym: But you never know.

613
00:31:53,234 --> 00:31:54,740
Rym: Someone will make that joke.

614
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,389
Rym: Like, "Oh, Harler was a

615
00:31:56,429 --> 00:31:56,772
Rym: Vodakath.".

616
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,313
Scott: Yeah, it's like, I don't care if it's an unpopulated place.

617
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:01,760
Scott: We were just talking about making the GeekNights gab.

618
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,599
Rym: I only care if it's a bad place filled with Nazis and child porn.

619
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,885
Scott: It's somewhat likely to happen.

620
00:32:05,946 --> 00:32:08,800
Scott: If it's a super popular place but it sucks, we're not going to be there.

621
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,560
Rym: So, we've been talking about this a lot in our own, like, normal lives.

622
00:32:15,081 --> 00:32:19,937
Rym: And it's been a topic that has been brought up a lot in relation to things like, say, NFTs, which are bad.

623
00:32:19,957 --> 00:32:20,438
Rym: They're a scam.

624
00:32:20,478 --> 00:32:20,980
Rym: Don't buy them.

625
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:28,500
Rym: But the concept of scarcity is something that a lot of nerds in particular don't necessarily think about that much.

626
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:34,578
Rym: And it's often the, like, people complain like, "Oh, I'm trying to buy badges for a con and scalpers,

627
00:32:34,618 --> 00:32:34,939
Rym: blah.".

628
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,172
Rym: Or, "I want a video card,

629
00:32:36,192 --> 00:32:36,516
Rym: blah.".

630
00:32:37,402 --> 00:32:43,740
Rym: And they end up having a lot of discourse about the method of getting the scarce thing.

631
00:32:44,341 --> 00:32:49,497
Rym: But they usually don't get to the conversation of, "Why is the thing scarce and what does that even

632
00:32:49,637 --> 00:32:49,938
Rym: mean?".

633
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:50,981
Scott: Right.

634
00:32:51,041 --> 00:33:04,140
Scott: So, this came up again today after coming up several times in the past because my brain spontaneously realized on its own, and the internet confirmed, right, that the word "scalper," what's the etymology of that word?

635
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,885
Scott: It's obvious once you think about it for two seconds.

636
00:33:06,905 --> 00:33:08,850
Scott: It's just you have to think about it for two seconds.

637
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:13,259
Scott: and it's like, "Oh, they used to scalp Native Americans and cash in their

638
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:13,700
Scott: scalps.".

639
00:33:14,205 --> 00:33:15,478
Scott: That's where that word comes from.

640
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:20,380
Scott: So, now I'm uncomfortable using that word, but I guess we'll use it for now until we find a better word.

641
00:33:20,861 --> 00:33:23,185
Rym: Well, what I will say is, I had to look around more about that word.

642
00:33:23,506 --> 00:33:30,520
Rym: There is a significant debate about the origin because it far predates that situation, potentially.

643
00:33:31,361 --> 00:33:37,500
Scott: That's interesting, but I would be willing to wager that the people trying to fight the etymology might be racist.

644
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,999
Rym: Yeah, no, they're not trying to fight it, but there are a lot of references.

645
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,300
Scott: It doesn't seem unlikely.

646
00:33:42,661 --> 00:33:51,140
Rym: There are a lot of references to it around, like, scalpling out parts of multi-use train tickets to generate additional train tickets.

647
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,301
Scott: Maybe.

648
00:33:53,002 --> 00:34:01,838
Scott: Regardless, there is a thing that happens often where there is a limited good, and that limited good is capitalism.

649
00:34:01,858 --> 00:34:03,060
Scott: We're in capitalism.

650
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:09,000
Scott: So, it's sold at a price below what people are willing to pay for it.

651
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:13,049
Rym: We should use the jargon where it's appropriate if we define it.

652
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:16,639
Rym: The jargon there, that is, "The price the market will

653
00:34:16,779 --> 00:34:17,020
Rym: bear.".

654
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:18,101
Scott: Sure.

655
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:23,239
Scott: So, you got a thousand seats in your theater, you're gonna have a concert, right?

656
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:34,159
Scott: If you change the price to a thousand dollars a ticket, giving you a total revenue of a thousand thousands, it would sell out because you're that popular.

657
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,540
Scott: If you change the price to two thousand, okay, now it's not gonna sell out, right?

658
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:46,620
Rym: There's a more nuanced take on this now, but if you learn, like, baby's first economics in high school, they'll talk about the demand curve.

659
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,141
Rym: This is basically what that is.

660
00:34:48,163 --> 00:34:56,100
Rym: The higher your price is, the fewer things you'll sell, but the fewer things you need to sell to make the same amount of money.

661
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,869
Scott: Yep, so the "correct" price, "correct" in quotes, right, is somewhere in there.

662
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:05,860
Scott: It's like the highest price you can set where you still sell all the thousand tickets.

663
00:35:06,821 --> 00:35:10,314
Scott: And then, right, if you set a lower price than that, you're just losing money.

664
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,060
Scott: That's not what a smart capitalist does.

665
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:20,140
Scott: And if you set a price too high, it's like, well, maybe you could actually make more money, mathematically speaking, in which case maybe that is what you do, right?

666
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:30,380
Scott: It's like, if I can sell a thousand tickets at a thousand dollars, but 999 tickets at two thousand dollars, well, that's clearly more money, right?

667
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,427
Scott: That's almost twice as much money.

668
00:35:32,467 --> 00:35:33,852
Scott: Not quite, but almost, right?

669
00:35:34,153 --> 00:35:36,160
Scott: So maybe selling out isn't the best idea.

670
00:35:36,541 --> 00:36:01,500
Scott: But what happens too often, and nerds always get mad about this constantly, which is why it keeps coming up all the time in nerd discussions of all nerd communities, is something will go on sale that is limited in quantity, like convention tickets or some limited merch thing, you know, some whatever, and the price for that thing will be very reasonable, right?

671
00:36:02,023 --> 00:36:03,739
Scott: Sneakers, just a very reasonable price.

672
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:09,477
Rym: Like, poll a hundred thousand people and everyone says, "Yeah, I would buy that thing at that price,

673
00:36:09,538 --> 00:36:09,879
Rym: sure.".

674
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,060
Scott: Yeah, sure.

675
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,959
Rym: Like, I would buy a 3080 at that price right now.

676
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:22,740
Scott: I would go to PAX for $50 tickets, yes, I would, and that's what they, maybe $75 tickets, that's what they charge, that's what I would pay, yeah.

677
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:31,340
Scott: But there's a thousand tickets, and there's ten or a hundred thousand people who were willing to and want to buy them at that price.

678
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:38,960
Scott: So what inevitably happens is somebody comes along who doesn't even want the tickets, they just want money, and they arbitrate.

679
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:57,720
Scott: They buy the tickets at the lower price and sell them at the higher price, and now the nerds, or the customers, right, are targeting that arbitrator as the evil party, and that is the person who receives the grievance, is this person, you know, the scalper who comes in and is just making money.

680
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:08,439
Scott: And very often, you know, those scalper-type people are, not always, right, but very often, they're just people of limited means just trying to get by in this world with a hustle.

681
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:21,840
Rym: That's something, especially during COVID, I think a lot about, like, below a certain level of harm, I really try not to begrudge someone their hustle, because this is, you know, the cruel realities of an evil world are the cruel realities of an evil world.

682
00:37:22,361 --> 00:37:22,581
Scott: Right.

683
00:37:22,842 --> 00:37:31,300
Scott: So, me, I see that, and I try to put the blame on, you know, sometimes there is a limited quantity because there has to be a limited quantity.

684
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:39,998
Rym: An intrinsic limitation, like, tax cannot make another hotel room appear in the city of Boston.

685
00:37:40,078 --> 00:37:41,000
Rym: They just cannot do that.

686
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:52,200
Scott: Right, there's only so many seats in the theater, right, this person isn't going to put on, you know, the band isn't going to play 20 nights in a row, right, and if they did, the same people would come every night.

687
00:37:54,145 --> 00:37:57,820
Scott: You know, Broadway shows, even though they are putting on several shows a week, it's still not enough.

688
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:04,108
Rym: You can only make a hockey arena so big where the new seats, people can't see anything.

689
00:38:04,169 --> 00:38:12,700
Rym: Like, there's a physical limit that cannot in any, like, let's say, like, forget, like, post-human, like, quantum physics nonsense.

690
00:38:13,242 --> 00:38:17,257
Rym: For the foreseeable reasonable future, it is literally impossible to increase the supply.

691
00:38:17,478 --> 00:38:17,840
Rym: Full stop.

692
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:25,960
Scott: Right, but in other cases, say, you know, a shiny Charizard Pokemon card, Pokemon cards are a big thing right now, right, you can't get them anywhere.

693
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,340
Scott: They, it's like, yeah, there are limited resources on Earth for printing Pokemon cards.

694
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,140
Rym: But they're effectively unlimited for all intents and purposes.

695
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:41,831
Scott: Given the capacity of human industry, even now, right, they could make effectively infinite Pokemon cards.

696
00:38:41,911 --> 00:38:47,760
Scott: We have the ability as humans to print a full set of Pokemon cards for everyone who wants one.

697
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:53,980
Rym: Everyone on Earth could have a shiny Charizard, and it would cost, the incremental cost of doing so would effectively be zero.

698
00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:02,620
Scott: Yeah, it's just cardboard, it's really inexpensive, and, you know, if you just said how many Pokemon card-wanters are out there, here, full set for everyone.

699
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:08,980
Scott: They could make one for everyone, they could probably sell it at a reasonable price, like a hundred bucks or something, and make profit on that, right?

700
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,396
Scott: They are making less simply because they want to.

701
00:39:13,621 --> 00:39:26,980
Rym: Yup, now, the reasons they want to, in those cases, get pretty complex, because on one hand, some things, and again, this is psychology, like not everyone does this, like Scott and I are, as you know if you've listened to the show, we're pretty anti-collective.

702
00:39:27,141 --> 00:39:27,839
Scott: I used to, I learned.

703
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:33,080
Rym: Oh yeah, I used to really want shiny X-Men cards, like you have no idea.

704
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:41,620
Rym: But, at the same time, when I was a kid, I remember thinking, this fucking complete set of Foil Wolverine 2 series are gonna pay for college someday.

705
00:39:42,982 --> 00:39:45,096
Scott: I mean, I thought that they might, but I liked them also.

706
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,666
Rym: I did also like them.

707
00:39:46,726 --> 00:39:49,019
Rym: I would like to bring them to school and show them off.

708
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:54,020
Scott: Even though I was prone to collecting things, I didn't collect things I didn't also like.

709
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:54,838
Scott: That is true.

710
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,200
Scott: I wasn't collecting things just for, ooh, this could be worth money, but I hate it.

711
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:02,300
Rym: Yup, I collected, like, I really wanted those Foil Wolverine cards, because we would trade X-Men cards.

712
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:07,860
Scott: I bought an X-Men comic that was all shiny, and I was like, maybe it'll be worth a lot someday, but I love reading it, I'm gonna read it ten times.

713
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,220
Rym: Yup.

714
00:40:08,761 --> 00:40:21,287
Rym: So, but, and while we're pretty anti-collecting now, like, I do not collect physical things, I don't even collect digital things, like, I am very personally opposed to that in my life, because I think it's a- Museums can do the collecting.

715
00:40:21,368 --> 00:40:22,675
Scott: Archive.org does the collecting.

716
00:40:22,715 --> 00:40:23,660
Scott: I don't need to do the collecting.

717
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:38,480
Rym: But, for something like a shiny Charizard card, the problem is, people seek it because it's rare, and if it was as available as the non-shiny Charizard, everyone would have the shiny one.

718
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:45,220
Rym: And the shiny one wouldn't be special, so people wouldn't feel like they were special if they had it, so they would not seek it out.

719
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:56,920
Rym: Thus, there would likely actually be less demand for it, meaning the price point you could sell it at would drop and approach the level of the current non-shiny Charizard.

720
00:40:57,981 --> 00:40:59,964
Scott: Now, so think about this, right?

721
00:41:00,044 --> 00:41:05,433
Scott: That means, like, let's say, you know, you had a concert, right?

722
00:41:05,793 --> 00:41:09,840
Scott: And you could make the concert hall as big as you wanted, right?

723
00:41:10,861 --> 00:41:13,570
Scott: And everyone could hear and see, right?

724
00:41:13,651 --> 00:41:16,360
Scott: It was a perfect, magical concert hall, right?

725
00:41:17,841 --> 00:41:22,032
Scott: So, you make it 1,000 seats, people really want it bad, they're willing to pay a lot to get in.

726
00:41:22,072 --> 00:41:25,220
Scott: You make it 2,000 seats, it still sells out, people really want to get in.

727
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,345
Scott: You make it 100,000 seats, right?

728
00:41:27,465 --> 00:41:33,380
Scott: Even though all the seats can see and hear equally, they're all front row amazing seats, 'cause magic, right?

729
00:41:33,921 --> 00:41:46,079
Scott: Because there are more seats, people will actually want less, there are people who will want to go only because there are fewer seats, 'cause then it's like, "Ah, I was

730
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:46,440
Scott: there.".

731
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:50,600
Scott: Everyone was there, now they didn't want to be there in the first place.

732
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,004
Rym: You might be thinking, "I'm not like that,".

733
00:41:52,184 --> 00:41:54,571
Rym: and that's like, "Yeah, sure, I'm not like that either,".

734
00:41:54,611 --> 00:41:55,172
Rym: but guess what?

735
00:41:56,175 --> 00:41:58,040
Rym: In aggregate, people are like that.

736
00:41:59,321 --> 00:42:12,540
Scott: And also, what's interesting to me that I keep asking this and no one ever answers me in my whole life, right, is that there's a situation where a person can see and understand a scam, right, or a psychological failing, right?

737
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:17,473
Scott: They know that the wine in the fancy bottle tastes better, they know that psychological trick, right?

738
00:42:17,513 --> 00:42:19,920
Scott: They've read about it, they fully understand it, right?

739
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:23,486
Scott: And yet, they fall for it.

740
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:30,880
Scott: And it's like, at least when I think about myself, I'm constantly thinking about those psychological tricks.

741
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:48,260
Rym: Well, this is where I don't want to say, "You are not better, we are not better," but some people, due to circumstance, biology, upbringing, all these different factors, introspect the decisions they make more carefully than other people.

742
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,045
Scott: I see people introspect, right?

743
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:52,988
Scott: They'll say, "Yes, I see that scam,".

744
00:42:53,048 --> 00:42:54,931
Scott: and then they'll say, "Yes, I fell for

745
00:42:54,951 --> 00:42:54,991
Scott: it.".

746
00:42:55,131 --> 00:43:00,220
Scott: They introspected that they did fall for it, and they say they'll fall for it again.

747
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,405
Scott: Ah, but also- It's like, "Yes, that stove is hot.

748
00:43:04,725 --> 00:43:08,031
Scott: I understand fully that if I touch it, my hand will burn.

749
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:08,932
Scott: I'm gonna,".

750
00:43:08,992 --> 00:43:13,800
Scott: and they say they're gonna touch it, and they do touch it again, and they know, and they said they know.

751
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:19,600
Rym: Think about the show we just did two days ago, where we talked about JRPGs, talked about grinding, and the anecdote I shared.

752
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:25,191
Rym: I am personally, right now, deeply opposed to time-wasting in video games.

753
00:43:25,231 --> 00:43:29,460
Rym: Don't waste my time, I only have so many seconds left on this earth before this body's gonna fall apart.

754
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:41,311
Rym: But at the same time, when I started playing Final Fantasy I to test an emulator out, I caught myself enjoying grinding on some imps and playing the game.

755
00:43:41,431 --> 00:43:50,780
Rym: I fell for it, despite not only knowing that I personally hate grinding, but having been vocal about that aspect.

756
00:43:51,121 --> 00:44:01,618
Scott: I mean, I'll sometimes I'll see something like, you know, something cool, like on Twitter, someone will talk about something, like a new product, I'll click on it, and I'll see that it's like, you know, time's running out, right?

757
00:44:01,698 --> 00:44:02,700
Scott: There's only so many.

758
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,063
Scott: And I'll be like, "Ooh, I better buy one.

759
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:07,027
Scott: I can feel myself wanting to buy

760
00:44:07,207 --> 00:44:07,327
Scott: one.".

761
00:44:08,449 --> 00:44:09,290
Scott: It worked, right?

762
00:44:09,331 --> 00:44:12,376
Scott: It worked on me, but I felt it working, I saw it.

763
00:44:12,436 --> 00:44:14,760
Scott: It's like I'm a fish, I bought, I bit the hook.

764
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:18,600
Scott: But also- But I was like, I said, "Wait a minute, that's a hook," and then I got off the hook.

765
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:23,804
Rym: But some of it too is the one factor is for some people, like Animal Crossing is a good example.

766
00:44:24,044 --> 00:44:26,466
Rym: There are some things like in Animal Crossing, like people play that game.

767
00:44:27,086 --> 00:44:32,010
Rym: Imagine some people earnestly like those X-Men cards, they just want the thing.

768
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:37,193
Rym: They want the shiny Charizard, not because it's rare, but because they want to put it in their Animal Crossing world.

769
00:44:37,954 --> 00:44:39,675
Rym: Like they want it for its own value.

770
00:44:39,695 --> 00:44:42,257
Rym: They enjoy it intrinsically for what it is.

771
00:44:42,797 --> 00:44:46,580
Rym: And for them, the scarcity actually makes their experience worse.

772
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:51,580
Rym: They would be happy if everyone could get that special Charizard to put in their Animal Crossing.

773
00:44:52,661 --> 00:44:59,280
Scott: Instead, that person is made to suffer waiting in lines, fighting with people, paying exorbitant prices on the reseller's market.

774
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:05,567
Rym: And again, I blame the companies because the companies are using that false scarcity, not always to make money, like the sneakers.

775
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:16,040
Rym: Those sneakers, like fancy Jordans or whatever, you could probably raise the price on those sneakers by an order of magnitude and sell the exact same number.

776
00:45:17,241 --> 00:45:18,182
Rym: Why don't they do that?

777
00:45:18,202 --> 00:45:19,944
Rym: A whole bunch of reasons.

778
00:45:19,964 --> 00:45:31,380
Rym: One, the ill will that would probably come from doing that, as well as the social consequences of doing that, probably far outweigh the money you would make as a giant company.

779
00:45:32,581 --> 00:45:38,452
Scott: Even though some of the people who buy them resell them, there are some kids who wait in the line and get them at an affordable price.

780
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:47,067
Scott: If you just had the initial MSRP be high, the kid would never get them.

781
00:45:47,088 --> 00:45:48,170
Scott: Zero kids would get them.

782
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:50,354
Scott: It would just be the wealthy people.

783
00:45:50,394 --> 00:45:53,220
Scott: Now there's a lot of kids who wait in line and don't get them.

784
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,933
Scott: And those kids would actually be spared the burden of waiting in line.

785
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:08,831
Rym: But at the same time, the incremental cost, if they agree that raising the price to that degree would cause too many problems, another alternative is make more Jordans.

786
00:46:09,072 --> 00:46:12,856
Rym: The incremental cost of making one more Jordan is zero.

787
00:46:12,876 --> 00:46:15,840
Rym: It rounds down to zero.

788
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:22,509
Scott: If you got 10,000 sneakerheads who want this new awesome shoe you just made, why not make 10,000 pairs of shoes?

789
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:30,080
Scott: Why not just take pre-orders, everyone tells you their size, you make exactly the shoes that everyone wants, you don't even make one extra shoe.

790
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:40,297
Scott: You just let everyone pre-order and tell you their size and that they want it, and they commit to buying it, and then they give you their credit card, and you make a shoe for everybody and you send it out.

791
00:46:40,317 --> 00:46:42,060
Scott: Don't make the limited edition in the first place.

792
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:53,940
Rym: So the problem there is for some things, and we're being generic here, like we're using a lot of different examples, for some things, if the supply were higher, a lot of people no longer want the thing.

793
00:46:54,881 --> 00:46:56,143
Rym: So you end up making less money.

794
00:46:56,163 --> 00:46:58,568
Rym: You make more things and fewer of them get bought.

795
00:46:58,869 --> 00:47:01,855
Rym: Like fewer than if you made a smaller number of things at the same price.

796
00:47:02,196 --> 00:47:04,140
Rym: So you make a thousand for a hundred bucks each.

797
00:47:04,561 --> 00:47:10,168
Rym: If you make 10,000 and you sell it for a hundred bucks each, you sell like a couple hundred.

798
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:19,160
Rym: That can happen because the scarcity drives some percentage of the demand, and depending on the product, that percentage could be higher or lower for a lot of reasons.

799
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:24,446
Rym: A third way to go would be, well, there's so many different ways you could go with this.

800
00:47:25,348 --> 00:47:30,014
Scott: The classic example is one of the most evil companies there is.

801
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:35,596
Rym: Oh, De Beers!

802
00:47:36,382 --> 00:47:37,419
Scott: I don't know where they rank now.

803
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,760
Rym: We've been mad about them since like RIT days.

804
00:47:42,081 --> 00:47:45,617
Scott: Yeah, well, I'm sure other people have been mad about them even longer.

805
00:47:45,637 --> 00:47:46,300
Scott: I just didn't know.

806
00:47:46,742 --> 00:47:50,277
Rym: I remember when I was in high school when I learned like, oh, diamonds aren't worth shit.

807
00:47:50,338 --> 00:47:50,860
Rym: It's a scam.

808
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:51,380
Scott: Right.

809
00:47:51,861 --> 00:47:58,729
Scott: So there's this impression that I've had most of my life until I learned better that diamonds are like a rare, valuable gem, right?

810
00:47:58,769 --> 00:48:01,713
Scott: I think, you know, it's just like a thing in culture, right?

811
00:48:01,773 --> 00:48:04,516
Scott: It's like, you know, yeah, diamonds are rare and valuable.

812
00:48:04,556 --> 00:48:06,859
Scott: They're just like emeralds, rubies, right?

813
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:12,400
Rym: If you don't believe that what we're about to say is true, go look at how much you can sell a diamond for.

814
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,079
Scott: I think there are documentaries about it you can watch.

815
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:18,811
Rym: Like take a diamond ring that's appraised at like fifty thousand dollars.

816
00:48:19,633 --> 00:48:21,880
Rym: You'd be lucky to sell that for five hundred bucks.

817
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:23,281
Scott: Right.

818
00:48:23,301 --> 00:48:29,769
Scott: So diamonds, you know, not even going into the fact that a lot of them are mined by basically slaves, right?

819
00:48:29,789 --> 00:48:37,440
Scott: You talk about blood diamonds or, you know, one talking about diamonds made in a lab and also there's a whole thing, you know, that's not relevant right now.

820
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,647
Scott: But De Beers basically had a monopoly, still kind of does, right, on diamond mining.

821
00:48:44,148 --> 00:48:51,196
Scott: So what they would do is they would have all these diamond mines operating evilly, right, and all the diamonds would go to De Beers, literally.

822
00:48:51,316 --> 00:48:54,620
Scott: This is not like a, this isn't like some metaphorical thing, right?

823
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:58,246
Scott: They collected all the diamonds from all the diamond mines into a vault.

824
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,670
Scott: A literal vault, right?

825
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:02,813
Scott: In one place, basically.

826
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:06,940
Scott: I don't know, it might have been several places, but effectively vaults, right?

827
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:14,340
Scott: And every year they would only allow a certain number of diamonds to leave the vault.

828
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:22,791
Scott: Effectively, right, there's plenty of diamonds on the earth, but this one company controls them all.

829
00:49:22,852 --> 00:49:27,920
Scott: You can't get one unless you go through them and they only release a certain amount on purpose.

830
00:49:28,401 --> 00:49:40,180
Scott: It's effectively the same thing as deciding to only print so many charasards and then they use their marketing to make commercials and things to make people believe that diamonds are rare and valuable.

831
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:48,730
Scott: They made them rare, they made people want them, and then they jacked up the price and so they've got a ton of something that is a high price.

832
00:49:48,891 --> 00:49:51,894
Scott: It's a high supply and a high demand and a high price.

833
00:49:51,934 --> 00:49:56,500
Scott: It doesn't match up because they basically cheated with monopoly power and scams.

834
00:49:57,201 --> 00:50:11,140
Rym: And I think the important thing for nerds to think about with scarcity is that whenever something is scarce and you want it, really find out for real if that thing is scarce for a good reason or a bad reason.

835
00:50:12,981 --> 00:50:19,247
Rym: Think about that first and understand it, because for conventions, there's literally no way to solve that problem.

836
00:50:19,287 --> 00:50:28,937
Rym: You can either raise the prices, which then excludes people who have less money, or you make it just random who gets in, but you can't make more supply.

837
00:50:28,977 --> 00:50:30,899
Rym: There's literally no way to do that, ever.

838
00:50:31,179 --> 00:50:31,780
Rym: It's impossible.

839
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:34,063
Rym: So what are you going to complain about?

840
00:50:34,103 --> 00:50:42,540
Rym: Don't complain about it, just try to find the system that's the most equitable to deal with it and minimize the pain of the fact that it's a limited supply thing.

841
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,736
Scott: Just get mad at the right thing, the world.

842
00:50:47,440 --> 00:51:00,100
Rym: Because the reality is, even PAX, like PAX East, they could probably triple that badge price and still sell plenty of badges and actually even make the experience of the people who get into PAX better, because they'd be less crowded, they'd have more money.

843
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,098
Scott: But only rich people would get in.

844
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,364
Rym: Yeah, only rich people would get in.

845
00:51:02,384 --> 00:51:03,970
Rym: It'd be a very different con.

846
00:51:04,391 --> 00:51:06,419
Rym: A product con I'd be less interested in going to.

847
00:51:07,312 --> 00:51:07,720
Scott: Probably.

848
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:26,700
Rym: Yeah, but again, look, changing these factors can increase or decrease demand, because demand can sometimes be caused by supply, and talking about that is way out of scope for the show, because at that point, you're going to hear me and Scott talk about how much we hate capitalism for at least an hour.

849
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:33,620
Scott: Right, but if someone out there intentionally artificially reduces supply...

850
00:51:34,201 --> 00:51:40,632
Rym: I think that is by default unethical and evil, unless there are significant mitigations.

851
00:51:41,293 --> 00:51:45,240
Rym: I don't give someone the benefit of the doubt, but there are situations where that could make sense.

852
00:51:47,181 --> 00:52:01,780
Scott: The only excuse capitalism has for its existence is that there are some things that are limited resources, and we can't figure out any kind of system to fairly distribute those resources to all the people on the earth.

853
00:52:03,141 --> 00:52:15,080
Scott: If you didn't have money, and it's like, okay, we've got a concert that's happening, there's a hundred seats, how do we choose which hundred people get that there's no system you can come up with to fairly decide who to give the hundred tickets to?

854
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,181
Scott: There just isn't, right?

855
00:52:16,262 --> 00:52:17,684
Scott: Random, it's like, that's not great.

856
00:52:18,165 --> 00:52:19,447
Scott: First in line, that's not great.

857
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:21,972
Scott: Money, obviously, not great.

858
00:52:22,253 --> 00:52:23,455
Scott: There is no answer.

859
00:52:23,735 --> 00:52:26,340
Scott: If you can come up with an answer, you will be like the savior of humanity.

860
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:40,320
Rym: Yep, and that brings us into something we've talked about, but just because the show, in case you didn't listen to the other gig nights, NFTs, non-fungible tokens, are a thing right now, and they are literally, one, they're a scam.

861
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,961
Rym: The technology's meaningless.

862
00:52:41,981 --> 00:52:47,266
Rym: They are literally just a pyramid scam, full stat, like just 100%, literally ignore them.

863
00:52:47,906 --> 00:53:03,680
Rym: But two, what they're doing fundamentally is trying to use technology to take something that is not scarce, like a JPEG that I could copy, and artificially make it specifically scarce in a way that is hard to overcome.

864
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,261
Rym: Now, the reality is they don't even do that.

865
00:53:06,442 --> 00:53:09,985
Rym: NFTs don't even do what they say they do, but that's a separate conversation.

866
00:53:11,547 --> 00:53:27,680
Rym: NFTs only exist because evil capitalists are trying to scam people into believing they have value long enough to do effectively a pump-and-dump scam without all those pesky regulations that apply to things like penny socks or money.

867
00:53:28,281 --> 00:53:40,859
Rym: There's a reason you can only buy NFTs with fake coins, because they're abstracting this by so many ways to make a non-scarce thing artificially and falsely scarce to trick people into buying it.

868
00:53:42,241 --> 00:53:50,580
Scott: Now, we have this capitalist system that we suffer with because we can't think of a better answer.

869
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,388
Rym: I mean, we can think of a lot of better answers.

870
00:53:52,428 --> 00:53:54,680
Rym: There's a lot of political reasons why we can't implement them.

871
00:53:55,241 --> 00:54:02,860
Scott: But in terms of just dealing with that fundamental problem of there's only so many things, how do we distribute them, there's no perfect answer to that.

872
00:54:03,661 --> 00:54:12,437
Scott: But the real perfect answer, which you'll see in so many sci-fi novels like Star Trek or The Culture or whatever, is there is no scarcity.

873
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:14,040
Scott: We just have enough stuff for everyone.

874
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,146
Scott: There's enough food for everyone.

875
00:54:15,166 --> 00:54:16,253
Scott: There's enough houses for everyone.

876
00:54:16,273 --> 00:54:17,440
Scott: There's enough spaceships for everyone.

877
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:21,166
Rym: Here's a specific example.

878
00:54:21,527 --> 00:54:29,200
Rym: This is a political thing that I strongly believe in as a specific policy that America should implement for real.

879
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:36,334
Rym: And my idea is there should be grocery stores that exist in America that are just free.

880
00:54:37,436 --> 00:54:38,258
Rym: Everything in them is free.

881
00:54:38,298 --> 00:54:39,080
Rym: Take as much as you want.

882
00:54:40,802 --> 00:54:42,145
Rym: They don't have everything, obviously.

883
00:54:42,165 --> 00:54:47,680
Rym: But there'll be a selection of cheese and a selection of meats and a selection of vegetables.

884
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:53,000
Scott: They're not going to have the rare ultra-fancy cheese because there's only so much to go around.

885
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,587
Rym: They might occasionally, like one store runs out of stuff because something gets popular.

886
00:54:56,607 --> 00:55:02,620
Rym: The government change is like, well, we have a new type of Swiss and it's hard to get for a while because people are excited about it.

887
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,965
Rym: But there's no secondary market.

888
00:55:05,286 --> 00:55:08,914
Rym: If I take a ton of the government cheese, I can't sell it to anyone.

889
00:55:08,954 --> 00:55:10,177
Rym: They can go get their own government cheese.

890
00:55:10,197 --> 00:55:11,420
Rym: Why are they going to buy it from me?

891
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,380
Scott: Well, you could go and take all the government cheese and now you've got it all.

892
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:18,708
Rym: So, obviously, you have some rules around.

893
00:55:18,908 --> 00:55:21,715
Rym: One, you've got to make it easier for people to just get the stuff.

894
00:55:21,795 --> 00:55:22,517
Rym: Make it free.

895
00:55:22,898 --> 00:55:23,620
Rym: Make it accessible.

896
00:55:24,141 --> 00:55:29,009
Rym: Maybe you do something like you show your government ID and there's some high up limit.

897
00:55:29,049 --> 00:55:34,117
Rym: Like, if you get more than 20 pounds of cheese in a week, you get cut off on cheese.

898
00:55:34,418 --> 00:55:35,700
Rym: Maybe you've got to file a government form.

899
00:55:36,241 --> 00:55:42,660
Scott: There are certain things, right, that we have the capacity, right, and not just digital, obviously digital things.

900
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:52,636
Rym: But we have the capacity in America to provide basic foodstuffs to literally every human being within the borders of America, full stop.

901
00:55:52,656 --> 00:55:54,018
Rym: Like, we have that today.

902
00:55:54,098 --> 00:55:55,300
Rym: We could make that happen.

903
00:55:56,221 --> 00:56:03,260
Scott: Not even just foodstuffs, but, you know, basic drugstore stuff, you know, feminine hygiene products.

904
00:56:04,204 --> 00:56:07,560
Rym: Say we're still in a world, like, while we think we need to get away from cars.

905
00:56:08,101 --> 00:56:09,920
Scott: Glasses because you have eyeballs that don't work.

906
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:15,014
Rym: Let's say that right now it is still necessary for people in certain places in America to have cars to live.

907
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:17,220
Rym: There should be a government car that's free.

908
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:25,340
Rym: Now, obviously, there's separate concerns around that, but things that are necessary to live...

909
00:56:25,361 --> 00:56:26,080
Scott: Government bicycle that's free.

910
00:56:26,381 --> 00:56:28,107
Rym: Yeah, there should be free government bicycles.

911
00:56:28,147 --> 00:56:32,040
Rym: I think anyone in America who wants a basic bicycle should be able to just get one.

912
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:38,020
Rym: The incremental cost of making the next bicycle to make that happen does round down to zero.

913
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:48,660
Rym: And the main argument is that if you make things free, the more things you make free, the more businesses collapse and can't, like, no one can make money selling bikes anymore.

914
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:52,668
Rym: Yeah, no one can make money selling a basic-ass bike anymore.

915
00:56:53,289 --> 00:56:54,953
Rym: Fancy bikes will still get made.

916
00:56:55,233 --> 00:56:58,460
Rym: There's still edges where capitalism makes sense and can exist.

917
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:04,980
Scott: Right, because the marginal cost of making another carbon fiber road bike is not going to round down to zero ever.

918
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:14,380
Rym: But the marginal cost of making, like, the equivalent of a Huffy, that kind of does round down to zero for a lot of reasons that are beyond the scope of this episode, too.

919
00:57:14,781 --> 00:57:20,520
Scott: And it's like, OK, you got your government bicycle, but it's like you still probably need help maintaining it, right?

920
00:57:21,061 --> 00:57:25,440
Scott: Even if I got a free government house, I still need to hire a plumber.

921
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,487
Rym: It's funny, the stream is a little bit behind.

922
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:30,237
Rym: Like, people chat based on, like, what they've seen in the stream.

923
00:57:30,257 --> 00:57:30,980
Rym: Like, it lags behind.

924
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:35,359
Rym: The listener came up with the "why don't you just make those things free" right before we started saying it.

925
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:37,223
Scott: They should be right.

926
00:57:37,343 --> 00:57:42,195
Scott: Anything that we have the capacity as a human race, not just country, but as a human race...

927
00:57:46,084 --> 00:57:47,317
Rym: It's hard to have a worldwide world.

928
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:56,540
Scott: Anything we have the capacity to produce in such large quantities that we can just make one for everyone who needs one and it's not a problem.

929
00:57:56,761 --> 00:57:57,939
Scott: And there are many such things.

930
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:01,800
Rym: It's not everything, but it's more things than you would think.

931
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:07,780
Scott: Yeah, it's a lot of, you know, all the things you need to just survive in the world.

932
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:13,080
Scott: And, you know, food, household goods, you know, clothing, basic clothing.

933
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:17,220
Rym: Now, some other things do have an extreme marginal cost, like healthcare.

934
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:27,180
Rym: Providing one more, like, high quality level of healthcare to a person, or adding one more person to the healthcare system, that actually incurs significant costs.

935
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,180
Scott: Yeah, there's only so many surgeons and they can only do so many surgeries.

936
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:38,020
Rym: But, as a society, we should invest in reducing the scarcity of those things, even if it does cost us a lot.

937
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:39,142
Scott: Right.

938
00:58:39,222 --> 00:58:42,080
Scott: Things that aren't scarce shouldn't be made scarce.

939
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:42,457
Rym: Yes.

940
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:48,400
Scott: And things that are scarce, the solution is not to, you know, milk 'em, right?

941
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,600
Rym: Yeah, some of those things should be...

942
00:58:49,661 --> 00:58:52,639
Scott: The solution is to work... Go ahead.

943
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,440
Rym: Oh yeah, some of those things we should make less scarce on purpose.

944
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:02,040
Rym: Some of those things we might agree we need to keep scarce because we're running into an intrinsic limitation.

945
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:06,500
Rym: Like, there's only so many rare earth metals possibly in the world right now.

946
00:59:08,024 --> 00:59:11,940
Scott: But yeah, make things as less... That's the real goal, right?

947
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:20,480
Scott: Is not to make a bunch of money by making things more scarce, which is what you see these NFT people doing, intentionally making scarcity on purpose to get money.

948
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,079
Scott: Like, that is the opposite of the goal.

949
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:27,360
Scott: The goal is to make it so that there's so little scarcity that everyone can just have everything.

950
00:59:27,541 --> 00:59:28,400
Scott: That's what we want.

951
00:59:28,821 --> 00:59:35,560
Rym: And this is why, you know, I've said this before, I am a communist, not like a Soviet communist.

952
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:44,500
Rym: Obviously there are different types of communism, but I do honestly believe in a heavily structured economy based on a lot of full-on communist principles.

953
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,200
Scott: The problem with the Soviet communism wasn't so much the communism as it was the autocracy.

954
00:59:49,901 --> 00:59:56,200
Rym: The autocracy, also the lack of the incremental cost of producing even basic things was a lot higher back then.

955
00:59:56,722 --> 01:00:00,840
Rym: And organization in a pre-computer era was very difficult.

956
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:02,320
Scott: They had some computers.

957
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:04,090
Rym: They did, but not on the scale we have to.

958
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:04,935
Rym: There's a lot of things there.

959
01:00:04,955 --> 01:00:05,660
Rym: That's a topic too.

960
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,400
Scott: The point is, democracy is the first principle.

961
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:13,899
Rym: But I guess where I'm going with that is that a radical revolution is probably not the way to achieve that.

962
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:23,340
Rym: Because the reality is right now, a lot of those capitalist systems do also exist partly because that's how a lot of people survive.

963
01:00:23,723 --> 01:00:26,120
Rym: Because we can't make everything un-scarce immediately.

964
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:32,380
Rym: And the most likely path forward to achieve all the things we're talking about here.

965
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:38,640
Rym: Remember when there was the healthcare debate and we had the idea of we can't just get Medicare for all because it's not popular enough.

966
01:00:39,021 --> 01:00:40,580
Rym: But what if we had a public option?

967
01:00:41,801 --> 01:00:46,200
Rym: That is the most likely practical path forward to reducing scarcity.

968
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:49,320
Rym: The idea is very simple and it ties into everything we just said.

969
01:00:49,661 --> 01:00:52,380
Rym: And this is something you should advocate for in politics, in my opinion.

970
01:00:53,303 --> 01:00:53,906
Rym: Say there's a thing.

971
01:00:54,227 --> 01:00:57,680
Rym: Maybe the government should start producing, let's say, dinner plates.

972
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:59,300
Rym: Like there's a government dinner plate.

973
01:01:00,043 --> 01:01:01,410
Scott: You love this dinner plate example.

974
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:02,958
Scott: You've heard this and you've repeated it like 20 times.

975
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:04,400
Rym: Government potatoes.

976
01:01:05,684 --> 01:01:07,640
Scott: I don't want to hear about the dinner plate ever again.

977
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:20,580
Rym: The government runs some potato farms and there's laws that pass that basically say the government will sell potatoes at prices the government determines and that is a public option.

978
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:22,340
Rym: Anyone can buy the government potatoes.

979
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:28,500
Rym: Now the government does not say, like a full-on communist society would say, that no one else is allowed to make potatoes.

980
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:29,640
Rym: There's a monopoly on potatoes.

981
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:34,220
Rym: Instead, the government says you are free to have capitalist potatoes.

982
01:01:34,701 --> 01:01:41,400
Rym: But your capitalism will always be competing with the public option, the government potato.

983
01:01:41,721 --> 01:01:44,580
Rym: If you try to charge too much for your potatoes, no one's going to buy your potatoes.

984
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:49,039
Scott: If your potato isn't any better than a government potato, no one's going to buy it.

985
01:01:49,361 --> 01:01:54,160
Rym: But that allows a transition to a less scarce society.

986
01:01:55,421 --> 01:02:04,980
Rym: One by one, the government just starts competing with capitalism with things where they can set a low price and subsidize it to make sure more people can have that thing.

987
01:02:06,801 --> 01:02:13,340
Scott: Anyway, the moral is in your individual life, when there is something you want and there's not enough of it and you don't get it, right?

988
01:02:14,182 --> 01:02:17,400
Scott: I want you to think about, A, blaming the right person.

989
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,547
Scott: Blame the person.

990
01:02:18,628 --> 01:02:20,060
Scott: Is it artificial scarcity?

991
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:26,980
Scott: If it's artificial scarcity, blame the person who made it artificially scarce, not necessarily someone who's taking advantage of that to make money, right?

992
01:02:27,602 --> 01:02:30,980
Scott: If it's not artificially scarce, blame the world.

993
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:32,980
Scott: There's no way to make more.

994
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,800
Scott: There has to be some way to decide who gets one and some don't.

995
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,360
Scott: There's going to be winners, there's going to be losers.

996
01:02:38,001 --> 01:02:41,320
Scott: There's nothing you can do about that unless you're a genius and you solve all our problems.

997
01:02:41,865 --> 01:02:43,499
Scott: So just accept it and don't get mad.

998
01:02:45,281 --> 01:02:56,720
Scott: And then if there's something that is scarce and you want it, some limited edition good or something because you're a nerd, and think about what you have to do to get it, you're going to have to wait in a line.

999
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:59,839
Scott: Think about whether it's worth it, whether you can afford it.

1000
01:03:01,241 --> 01:03:05,539
Scott: Think about it really hard because the cost is going to be high to you.

1001
01:03:08,062 --> 01:03:13,540
Scott: And don't just fall for it so easily and go run out and wait in line for sneakers for 10 hours and then don't end up with anything.

1002
01:03:14,501 --> 01:03:17,859
Scott: You've got better ways to spend your life than doing that.

1003
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:23,820
Rym: And also, companies, conventions, and all the scarce nerd stuff, we just really mid-max it.

1004
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,307
Rym: I don't go after something that's scarce.

1005
01:03:25,608 --> 01:03:28,140
Rym: If there's very little likelihood, I will succeed.

1006
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:35,300
Scott: And to the companies out there, what I want you to hear is stop making things artificially scarce, obviously.

1007
01:03:36,223 --> 01:03:41,980
Scott: But when things aren't artificially scarce, right now video cards aren't artificially scarce, they're scarce scarce.

1008
01:03:44,461 --> 01:03:55,440
Scott: When you're selling them to people, if you insist on keeping the price low for reasons, at least try not to make people wait in line or do bullshit.

1009
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,204
Rym: Make the thing less painful.

1010
01:03:57,464 --> 01:03:58,407
Rym: Have a lottery.

1011
01:03:58,487 --> 01:03:59,951
Rym: Everyone signs up, there's a date.

1012
01:04:00,412 --> 01:04:03,138
Rym: After that date, everyone who signed up, there's a lottery to see who gets it.

1013
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:09,117
Scott: Or you can just have, "Hey everyone, give me your email address and I'll email you when I have a video

1014
01:04:09,157 --> 01:04:09,458
Scott: card.".

1015
01:04:10,803 --> 01:04:14,199
Scott: Once you get the email, you'll have 10 minutes to buy it or not.

1016
01:04:15,161 --> 01:04:23,600
Scott: And that way you don't have to waste your time or pay overpriced middlemen marking it up or anything like that.

1017
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,807
Scott: Just make it easy for people to get the limited good.

1018
01:04:26,827 --> 01:04:28,552
Scott: You've got a sneaker, you're only going to make a thousand.

1019
01:04:28,572 --> 01:04:29,394
Scott: for whatever reason.

1020
01:04:29,414 --> 01:04:31,500
Scott: you've already decided to make artificial scarcity.

1021
01:04:32,061 --> 01:04:39,099
Scott: Just say, "Okay, here's the website, type in your email address, we're going to email a thousand

1022
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:39,340
Scott: people.".

1023
01:04:40,321 --> 01:04:42,712
Scott: Just don't make people wait in line and suffer.

1024
01:04:42,873 --> 01:04:44,360
Scott: Stop making people suffer for no reason.

1025
01:04:44,581 --> 01:04:45,207
Scott: And the public option.

1026
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:47,640
Scott: I guess they're doing it intentionally.

1027
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:54,360
Rym: And advocate for things like public options to reduce the harm of this type of scarcity in the first place.

1028
01:04:54,681 --> 01:05:04,760
Rym: Especially for, and again, you can read about this on your own and dig around, but a surprising number of things have an incremental cost of making one more of zero in the modern world.

1029
01:05:05,542 --> 01:05:09,380
Rym: It is a fascinating situation we've put ourselves in as a society.

1030
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,420
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1031
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:23,520
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1032
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,940
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1033
01:05:29,221 --> 01:05:31,888
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1034
01:05:32,029 --> 01:05:36,100
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1036
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:44,460
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1037
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,560
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1038
01:05:48,243 --> 01:06:17,000
Rym: And the Patreon Patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Heidi McNichol, Alan Joyce, Lincoln G, Dread Lily, Tenebrae, Chris Reimer, Clinton Walton, Crane, Paddock, Old Man, Safe, Desk, Peacock, Mind, Snack, Finn, Graham Finch, Just Like, A Dude Guy, Ren from New Zealand Review, Mad Bull, 34 Cowards, Ryan Perrin, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Harrell, Taylor Braun, You hold the key to my heart at a bunch of people who do not want me to say their names.

1039
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:18,446
Rym: So, uh, yeah.

1040
01:06:19,008 --> 01:06:21,699
Rym: Watching the Rangers get kind of crushed right now.

1041
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:22,885
Rym: So, uh, yeah.

1042
01:06:23,288 --> 01:06:24,898
Rym: Anyway, now I leave you with...
