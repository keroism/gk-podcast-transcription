1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,196
Scott: It's Wednesday December 28th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:14,216 --> 00:00:24,096
Scott: We talk about Lupin's essay Galaxy Express 999 the first original movie and Samurai Champloo.

3
00:00:25,102 --> 00:00:25,833
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:27,002 --> 00:00:28,788
Rym: So no one's really in my office.

5
00:00:28,808 --> 00:00:32,360
Rym: this week everyone took vacation except me and one Indian guy is pretty cool.

6
00:00:32,662 --> 00:00:44,865
Scott: People are in my office, but the train is kind of empty Except for this morning when one of the trains didn't show and then we had twice as many people on the next train And it was kind of sucky Though my co-worker.

7
00:00:44,905 --> 00:00:46,470
Rym: He uh he gave me a gift.

8
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:53,439
Rym: That's either going to kill me or be awesome And I won't know until New Year's when I actually try to use this gift.

9
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:56,288
Scott: It's probably some sort of poison alcohol or something.

10
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:00,060
Rym: well the thing is I I very much enjoy my wine, and I very much enjoyed port.

11
00:01:00,865 --> 00:01:06,649
Rym: Scott doesn't but I'm not Scott and This guy had this old old old bottle.

12
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:13,934
Rym: It's about seven years old since he got it and it aged for many years before that and it's a South African port wine.

13
00:01:14,315 --> 00:01:21,580
Rym: tawny and Basically, it's an only port wine is weird because there's sediment and crap in it like floating around.

14
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:34,000
Rym: it looks like there's dirt floating around and you got a decanted all this weird stuff to drink it and This is an old expensive cool bottle of port and I'm gonna open it on the new year And if it doesn't kill me I'll have something to say about it next Monday.

15
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:36,056
Scott: It'll be pretty hilarious if you know you like.

16
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:42,729
Scott: you open it And then you barf and then you try to drink it in your barf, and it's just poison Can't be worse than whatever that spoiled liquor was.

17
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:44,355
Rym: your parents had those on.

18
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:45,820
Scott: my grandpa had it was.

19
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,843
Scott: I don't know what it the hell.

20
00:01:46,903 --> 00:01:51,417
Scott: They called it, but it's his weird yellow stuff, and it's just wow.

21
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:52,240
Rym: what do they say?

22
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,820
Scott: There's only one drink you can make with it, but my dad said there's only one drink You can make with it, and he's probably right cuz he knows a lot about that.

23
00:01:57,902 --> 00:02:03,985
Rym: It Yeah, so in real news You know a while ago.

24
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:08,940
Rym: We made a big deal about this Windows exploit where Internet Explorer you could get screwed.

25
00:02:11,023 --> 00:02:13,021
Rym: There's another one that's Worse.

26
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:15,650
Scott: how could it be worse than visit a website?

27
00:02:15,992 --> 00:02:17,056
Scott: your computer is rooted.

28
00:02:17,316 --> 00:02:18,280
Scott: nothing you can do about it.

29
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:22,159
Rym: It's visit a website your computer is rooted, and it's harder to patch it or work around it.

30
00:02:23,524 --> 00:02:29,165
Rym: great Basically windows, there's this file format a Wmf a Windows metafile.

31
00:02:29,185 --> 00:02:31,230
Scott: I thought those are Windows media files.

32
00:02:31,993 --> 00:02:36,628
Rym: I heard when the Schlosshauer says Windows metafile whatever and they can contain media.

33
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,887
Rym: they can also contain viruses and Firefox won't protect you nor will opera.

34
00:02:41,947 --> 00:02:43,050
Rym: no well it nor will anything.

35
00:02:43,271 --> 00:02:48,427
Scott: so it's in the code in Windows that that processes these files No matter what program opens the files.

36
00:02:48,508 --> 00:02:48,788
Rym: Yes.

37
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:49,832
Rym: There is no patch.

38
00:02:50,193 --> 00:02:51,959
Rym: There is really nothing you can do about it.

39
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:59,356
Rym: So if you're running Windows Don't go to suspicious websites for at least the next month until a patch comes out.

40
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:00,219
Rym: You're kind of hosed.

41
00:03:01,741 --> 00:03:03,688
Scott: So remind me why people use Windows again.

42
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:04,551
Rym: They don't know better.

43
00:03:04,572 --> 00:03:05,736
Rym: All right.

44
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,840
Rym: I Mean unless you play games you have no reason to use Windows anymore.

45
00:03:11,322 --> 00:03:26,408
Rym: Because I mean like just the other day when we over New Year's We had our Scott's grandma had an old lady friend who needed help with her computer And we went over there to try to you know fix it or whatever was wrong with it and It just had viruses and there's really no way to fix it.

46
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:31,261
Scott: Yeah, and the virus is a disabled Norton so he couldn't use Norton We.

47
00:03:31,362 --> 00:03:34,752
Scott: she was on dial-up so he couldn't really download any tools to help us.

48
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:44,759
Scott: We didn't have any tools with us and It changed her home page, which kind of confused her but really there was nothing protecting her from getting more viruses at this point.

49
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:57,639
Scott: and And Then we couldn't clean them up short of formatting the hard drive installing windows again Yeah, and for what she did which is like visit one website do email and word process.

50
00:03:58,582 --> 00:04:02,347
Scott: Linux would have been more than enough 10,000 times more than enough.

51
00:04:02,728 --> 00:04:10,600
Rym: in fact in January most likely we're gonna head back down there Give her Linux and we'll probably have a full report on us converting two cool old ladies to Linux.

52
00:04:11,022 --> 00:04:19,916
Scott: Yeah, my other grandma uses Linux already because I just gave her a computer but They don't know how to use it, but this grandma would know how to use a computer better, so we'll see.

53
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,665
Rym: yeah But I'm starting to see.

54
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:31,695
Rym: I mean a lot of people like whenever there's a big exploit I a lot of apologists seem to always say things like oh Yeah, this was just one bad thing and then Microsoft patches it.

55
00:04:32,337 --> 00:04:33,000
Rym: you haven't noticed.

56
00:04:33,141 --> 00:04:38,200
Rym: This has been happening on a regular basis for the last couple of years with increasing frequency.

57
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:51,468
Scott: yeah, the other thing is that people like okay, they've patched most of the exploits or whatever but That's only if you're like a company or something and you maintain your windows And you put a lot of effort into it and all kinds of stuff.

58
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:58,953
Scott: Yeah, you can get it to be usable and Relatively perfect or even perfect as perfect as windows can be.

59
00:04:59,695 --> 00:05:00,257
Scott: but Linux.

60
00:05:00,278 --> 00:05:02,082
Scott: You don't have to do Anything.

61
00:05:02,644 --> 00:05:04,774
Scott: it just is even a shitty.

62
00:05:04,854 --> 00:05:08,719
Scott: old Linux might be shitty But he won't fuck up.

63
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:17,631
Rym: I mean there are a few exploits for old versions of Linux like Red Hat 5 had a bunch of exploits But you're not flying around the net crazily.

64
00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:19,660
Scott: you won't get them just visiting websites.

65
00:05:20,783 --> 00:05:30,136
Scott: Not that I'm you know Planning on using blu-rays or HD DVDs or anything anytime soon because you know I don't have an HDTV and I probably won't get one.

66
00:05:30,156 --> 00:05:36,436
Scott: and You know I'm probably not gonna get a PlayStation 3.

67
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:41,292
Scott: So It's not like I care, but if one of the formats has to win out.

68
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:43,618
Scott: It looks like it's gonna be blu-ray.

69
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:44,120
Scott: now.

70
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:55,679
Scott: blu-ray supposedly has more space to store more stuff which I guess is good and Supposedly it has DRM, but HD DVD also has DRM.

71
00:05:56,001 --> 00:06:04,494
Rym: So they're both bad, and we're really rooting for DVD John to on DRM it real quick DVD on become blu-ray on.

72
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:18,254
Scott: but Apparently the reason I think blu-ray is gonna win is because today we found out that it's gonna have regioning which you know I guess is some sort of necessary evil nowadays, but no it's not a necessary evil.

73
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:18,956
Rym: That's horseshit.

74
00:06:19,277 --> 00:06:19,478
Scott: Well.

75
00:06:19,498 --> 00:06:19,719
Scott: Okay.

76
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:20,965
Rym: Yeah It's just an evil.

77
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:26,328
Rym: Yeah exists solely to limit supply Segment markets and make profits for the company.

78
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:30,219
Rym: It has no benefit other than to the company that designed it and implemented it.

79
00:06:31,188 --> 00:06:40,880
Scott: Yeah pretty much, but Japan and the US on blu-ray will both be region one Which means really?

80
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,285
Scott: That a lot of things.

81
00:06:43,365 --> 00:06:48,901
Scott: I mean how are they gonna sell Japanese anime DVDs for 40 bucks and American ones for 20?

82
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:51,880
Scott: Well, I guess they'll be blu-ray, so there might be more money across the board.

83
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:59,660
Rym: Well the way they do that now is they delay the American releases several months hoping that the people in Japan Just won't be able to wait and they'll buy the expensive job.

84
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,544
Scott: That's not gonna work.

85
00:07:00,584 --> 00:07:00,805
Scott: now.

86
00:07:00,845 --> 00:07:10,248
Scott: if the blu-rays are all region one across because people just start Buying blu-rays anime fans will get blu-ray players and get Japanese DVDs Which plays right into the.

87
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,305
Rym: basically it'll only screw the American Anime publishers.

88
00:07:13,546 --> 00:07:19,937
Rym: yeah, but actually if the Japanese start doing what they seem to be doing a lot more Which is putting English subtitles on their internal releases yep?

89
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:29,093
Scott: But at the same time if the Americans keep putting their blu-rays out cheaper than the Japanese blu-rays Then it'll screw the Japanese public.

90
00:07:29,153 --> 00:07:41,435
Scott: eventually what you're gonna Get is you're gonna get the Americans who want stuff right away And don't care about the cost Buying from Japan and the Japanese who care about cost and don't need it as soon as it comes out buying from America And it's gonna be all screwed up.

91
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:49,158
Rym: Yeah But it also kind of I mean American and Japanese culture at least as far as geeks are concerned are moving toward each other.

92
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:53,886
Scott: mm-hmm Definitely the geek arena Japan US merging.

93
00:07:53,906 --> 00:08:00,199
Rym: of course if you step back from geekery you realize that most Americans Don't even really know where Japan is or what it does.

94
00:08:00,943 --> 00:08:05,860
Scott: yeah, they know nothing about it other than cars come from there and You know the people look different.

95
00:08:06,242 --> 00:08:10,600
Rym: I mean I feel bad cuz there's a cool Korean guy in my office, and I sit my Sharon office with him.

96
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,284
Rym: He's a really cool guy.

97
00:08:11,304 --> 00:08:12,047
Rym: He's into video games.

98
00:08:12,068 --> 00:08:22,391
Rym: He has a wife kid all that stuff and The rest of the people in the office don't seem to realize that there's a difference between you know All the different Asian countries in the Korea Japan China.

99
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:23,394
Rym: They're all different.

100
00:08:23,956 --> 00:08:25,260
Scott: yep very different.

101
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:30,568
Scott: I mean I used to not be able to tell the difference But I knew there was a difference, and I would.

102
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:32,676
Scott: I would be like so which one are you?

103
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:33,940
Scott: but now?

104
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,366
Scott: But now I can mostly know the difference.

105
00:08:36,446 --> 00:08:54,460
Scott: I mean I probably couldn't tell you the difference between a Cambodian or a Vietnamese guy But I could tell you difference between a Chinese a Korean and Japanese guy which are the major ones You know and I can't expect people to you know be able to recognize You know which country people are from just by looking at him and talking.

106
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,309
Rym: I don't expect that but I expect no one's to not.

107
00:08:57,389 --> 00:08:59,255
Rym: I mean like say where we are.

108
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:00,900
Rym: company was looking into hiring us.

109
00:09:01,202 --> 00:09:07,590
Rym: some guy who happened to have the same last name as The Korean guy in my department just because it's a common Korean name mm-hmm.

110
00:09:07,811 --> 00:09:09,777
Rym: so someone asked him seriously.

111
00:09:09,797 --> 00:09:10,620
Rym: Do you know him?

112
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:14,689
Rym: And The guy looked and he's like that.

113
00:09:14,729 --> 00:09:15,513
Rym: names like Smith.

114
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:23,968
Rym: Yeah, you want Yep, and they actually seriously suggested that he should interview the guy to make him feel more at home Mmm.

115
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:28,007
Scott: Yeah, yeah It's kind of like that Seinfeld episode.

116
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,833
Scott: It was a Barbara Chang or something like that.

117
00:09:30,294 --> 00:09:33,667
Scott: Yeah, Donna Chang Donna Chang By the name.

118
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:38,128
Scott: they were like oh Asian, and it wasn't Asian It was just Donna Chang.

119
00:09:38,168 --> 00:09:41,550
Scott: Steen change her name to Chang and was yeah Seinfeld is funny.

120
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:42,319
Rym: my co-workers are off.

121
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:42,964
Rym: I mean they all.

122
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:51,157
Rym: they know that I like Japanese Animation because I have my office is full of wall scrolls and little figurines and pencil board.

123
00:09:51,177 --> 00:09:52,561
Scott: the only thing I have is a little Mario.

124
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:56,394
Rym: the background and all my pcs are anime things and all the servers I built.

125
00:09:56,414 --> 00:09:58,722
Rym: I'm putting anime themed backgrounds on them and all This stuff.

126
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:07,959
Rym: awesome, but every now and then when they're looking for some sort of support online They'll run afoul of a Chinese website because we do a lot of business with China, and they always come in like.

127
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:14,648
Rym: You know Japanese come and read this and I walk in and like that's Chinese And I don't know Japanese to begin with.

128
00:10:14,728 --> 00:10:16,033
Rym: so I don't know what you want.

129
00:10:16,495 --> 00:10:17,620
Scott: Yeah, what are they thinking?

130
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,103
Rym: I don't know what they're thinking.

131
00:10:19,143 --> 00:10:21,953
Scott: the same thing that people who are running windows are thinking yeah, nothing.

132
00:10:22,415 --> 00:10:23,900
Rym: Yeah, don't run windows, okay?

133
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,881
Scott: Alright, so one of my favorite kinds of music is the the nerdcore hip-hop.

134
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:39,350
Scott: You know optimist run MC front a lot.

135
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:54,757
Scott: so there's these guys and I'll admit that their rap skills are not the greatest but their lyrics are very good and their music video is very good, and they are called 64k and They're elite.

136
00:10:55,363 --> 00:11:02,368
Scott: Let me tell you Yeah, only one of them really had the rapping skills, and it wasn't that great skills to be.

137
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:03,514
Scott: anyway You know it was.

138
00:11:03,976 --> 00:11:06,589
Scott: he was better than the other two, but he still wasn't great.

139
00:11:07,273 --> 00:11:08,499
Rym: Yeah, it was.

140
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,745
Rym: it was amusing video to watch.

141
00:11:09,765 --> 00:11:19,010
Rym: it went a little long And I probably stopped watching except for the fact that While it was kind of corny the lyrics if you listen to the words were very clever very very clever.

142
00:11:19,151 --> 00:11:20,818
Rym: That's mostly what they got going for themselves.

143
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:25,507
Scott: Yep, so you know and definitely we love the part where the.

144
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:40,544
Scott: It's great because they go through like all the history of gaming all the way from Commodore up to like stuff That's not even out yet, and if you are also leet a lot of this stuff will just like ring true with you Like the one piece he guy he goes in and he's like.

145
00:11:40,584 --> 00:11:43,076
Scott: he's talking about the PC games He played and how he was so great.

146
00:11:43,618 --> 00:11:48,548
Scott: He's like the best is still mech warrior, and I'm like yeah You know just Gauss.

147
00:11:49,252 --> 00:11:57,249
Scott: Yeah, so you know if you listen to this then I'm sure one of the guys will say some things that ring true with you If you're a gamer, and you'll enjoy it.

148
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,937
Rym: So my thing I ran into.

149
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:09,987
Rym: well first of all you all know there's a pruder film the film of JFK being shot by some guy named a pruder who just happened to be there and happened to be filming at the time.

150
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,750
Scott: yep, and

151
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:21,008
Rym: first of all whenever you've seen it a lot of people have seen it in documentaries or on TV or whatever and It looks like it's the zoomed in thing of like Kennedy, and it's real short and

152
00:12:21,028 --> 00:12:22,516
Scott: a lot of times He's shown in black and white -

153
00:12:22,757 --> 00:12:23,722
Rym: yeah, which I don't get.

154
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:24,466
Rym: it was filmed in color.

155
00:12:24,687 --> 00:12:32,094
Rym: Yep, but Basically if you ever watch the real Zapruder film It's zoom way out.

156
00:12:32,134 --> 00:12:38,293
Rym: you can see a lot more than they show you on TV - it's real shaky and hard to see anything Mmm.

157
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:41,473
Rym: So someone is taking it and Stabilized the image.

158
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:46,347
Rym: so instead of the JFK shaking around on the screen the edge of the screen shakes around.

159
00:12:46,648 --> 00:12:54,449
Rym: they did a whole bunch of Optimization things and the end result is a very watchable very creepy film of JFK being murdered.

160
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,160
Rym: Snuff yeah, basically it is well.

161
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:03,794
Rym: it also very nicely disproves the Somewhat silly theory.

162
00:13:03,814 --> 00:13:07,710
Rym: a lot of people have had that the Secret Service guy sitting in the front seat turned around and shot him.

163
00:13:08,352 --> 00:13:09,416
Scott: Yeah, like you.

164
00:13:09,437 --> 00:13:16,770
Rym: I just said it because I had a high school AP US history yeah, but when you said it you sounded pretty convinced.

165
00:13:17,313 --> 00:13:19,304
Rym: I said it that way because that's the way he presented it.

166
00:13:19,364 --> 00:13:19,807
Rym: It was funny.

167
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:30,026
Rym: that way One day we had a class and he shut the door and he's like so I'm gonna show you all who really shot JFK, and it was just kind of funny.

168
00:13:30,849 --> 00:13:39,294
Rym: one time We got a Secret Service guy in class To talk about stuff, and he shut the door and he showed the guy the video and he was like Explain that.

169
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:44,360
Rym: and the Secret Service guy was like what the fuck What the hell I'm here to talk about not this?

170
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:51,611
Rym: Hmm crazy crazy teachers, but if you watch this video which is nice and cleaned up you see that the guy turns around.

171
00:13:51,651 --> 00:13:56,831
Rym: it has this look of oh shit on his face and He's not really pointing anything at JFK.

172
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,000
Scott: Yeah, definitely not pointing anything.

173
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,496
Scott: I mean you don't even see bullets coming from anywhere or anyone shooting anything in the video.

174
00:14:03,556 --> 00:14:04,922
Scott: It's just oh there He is.

175
00:14:05,123 --> 00:14:05,505
Scott: oh my god.

176
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:05,987
Scott: He shot.

177
00:14:06,268 --> 00:14:11,160
Rym: It's kind of eerie because he's like he's shot and His wife is leaning over like are you okay?

178
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,986
Rym: And the guy in front is like what the hell's going on and it looks like everyone's just like trying to figure out what happened And then suddenly his head explodes.

179
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:21,566
Scott: Yeah, it's funny because if you look at the grassy and all this this guy He was like falling over himself.

180
00:14:21,887 --> 00:14:23,473
Rym: Yeah, like he falls over and rolls.

181
00:14:23,714 --> 00:14:25,240
Scott: Yeah, like like he heard the shots.

182
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,305
Scott: He must have heard the shots.

183
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:29,640
Scott: He was probably like ducking and stumbling and it was really funny looking at that guy.

184
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:30,910
Rym: No, he was the third gunman.

185
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:31,999
Scott: He was running from the scene.

186
00:14:34,245 --> 00:14:35,640
Scott: No, I'm pretty sure he's just some dumb guy.

187
00:14:35,912 --> 00:14:36,843
Rym: Yeah Cuz we all know that.

188
00:14:36,883 --> 00:14:40,599
Rym: the truth was that Chuck Norris went back in time and roundhouse kicked him to death.

189
00:14:41,688 --> 00:14:44,985
Scott: You can see it right in the video He's just in between frames cuz.

190
00:14:45,005 --> 00:14:49,857
Rym: he roundhouse kicks so fast cuz remember if you can't see Chuck Norris your seconds from death.

191
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:59,635
Scott: Yep So it's anime day Yeah, and it would be also comic book day except on holiday weeks when there's no Monday.

192
00:14:59,795 --> 00:15:04,331
Scott: diamond ships comic books on Thursday Which means I get them tomorrow and next week.

193
00:15:04,392 --> 00:15:05,677
Scott: I'll also get them on Thursday.

194
00:15:05,737 --> 00:15:13,510
Scott: So But you're gonna have to wait but it's me a good weight because Every great comic is coming out.

195
00:15:13,751 --> 00:15:19,790
Rym: Yeah in this week, so fair Plus we had a chance to go through some other stuff.

196
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,720
Rym: We've got lying around and we watched three shows we can talk about.

197
00:15:23,203 --> 00:15:25,016
Scott: Yeah, it's good to have anime on the computer.

198
00:15:25,238 --> 00:15:30,680
Rym: Yep So we got some Lupin the third action, but not the Lupin the third action that you're probably gonna expect.

199
00:15:31,882 --> 00:15:44,369
Rym: Got some Galaxy Express 999 because we're really on a kick with that guy's works now yep, and samurai Champloo, which Rym hadn't seen no cuz I was on co-op when they showed it in Club and Never got around to watching it.

200
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:44,731
Scott: Yep.

201
00:15:44,771 --> 00:15:45,938
Scott: So you watch the first episode of that.

202
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:47,751
Rym: So Lupin the third.

203
00:15:47,772 --> 00:15:48,296
Rym: we love.

204
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,310
Scott: Lupin is like the awesomest dude, even though once you watch it enough It's just the same thing over and over for some reason.

205
00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:03,340
Scott: It's still entertaining every time and I mean Especially great in a group because just you sit there you watch it and everyone's yelling and screaming when the same things happen.

206
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,585
Scott: It's just hilarious.

207
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:04,805
Scott: Yep.

208
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:05,649
Scott: Oh my god.

209
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:06,191
Scott: He shot him.

210
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:07,014
Scott: Oh my god.

211
00:16:07,074 --> 00:16:07,556
Scott: Oh my god.

212
00:16:07,596 --> 00:16:08,760
Scott: That guy was the one in disguise.

213
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:10,749
Scott: Oh my god, that guy was upon in disguise.

214
00:16:10,849 --> 00:16:11,432
Scott: Oh my god.

215
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:12,738
Scott: He escaped in a miracle.

216
00:16:12,818 --> 00:16:17,078
Scott: Oh my god He escaped in another miracle G gun shot someone going on cut someone.

217
00:16:17,118 --> 00:16:17,520
Scott: Oh my god.

218
00:16:18,401 --> 00:16:25,665
Rym: Well, we got a hold of as far as we know the first Lupin Animation ever.

219
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,450
Scott: Yep, the Lupin pilot.

220
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,580
Rym: It was the pilot for the first anime of Lupin.

221
00:16:30,881 --> 00:16:34,820
Rym: I mean, yeah, if you've seen Lupin on the Cartoon Network, that's actually the second TV show.

222
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:39,339
Scott: Yeah, they don't tell you that the first TV show the theme song is like Lupin.

223
00:16:42,315 --> 00:16:48,326
Rym: Yeah And this was the pilot for that.

224
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:54,522
Rym: it's old old old school, but you know what it's the same action it was.

225
00:16:54,623 --> 00:17:02,453
Scott: it was so weird because even though there was just some dumb guy being the voice of Lupin and What was happening was really kind of weird.

226
00:17:02,473 --> 00:17:05,646
Rym: It was just a Excuse to introduce a bunch of characters.

227
00:17:05,827 --> 00:17:12,079
Scott: Yeah, like half of the stuff was just like every time you saw a new character Which wasn't really new to us because we knew the characters.

228
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:12,902
Scott: Well, most of them.

229
00:17:13,805 --> 00:17:15,569
Scott: it just you know, it explained who they were.

230
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,192
Scott: So it starts out.

231
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:21,351
Scott: It's like Zenigata the guy who chases Lupin Lupin the great thief.

232
00:17:21,835 --> 00:17:27,140
Scott: Yep Jigen his sidekick the great shot Fujiko their arch-nemesis.

233
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:37,192
Scott: But then it was all weird because in all the Lupin I've ever seen a red go him on the ninja Samurai guy is helping Lupin and me, you know, even

234
00:17:37,232 --> 00:17:39,500
Rym: first episode of the second TV their best friends

235
00:17:39,702 --> 00:17:45,377
Scott: Yep, but in this one They were like going on the guy who was sworn to kill Lupin and wasn't.

236
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:46,522
Scott: we were like What is this?

237
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:49,654
Rym: some kind of one of Lupin's tricks, but now he tries to kill him.

238
00:17:50,056 --> 00:17:51,120
Scott: Yeah, it was kind of weird.

239
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:58,799
Scott: so now I kind of want to read some like old Lupin manga because that's obviously I think the way it originally was and There must have been at some point where it turned around.

240
00:17:59,141 --> 00:18:03,620
Scott: Yeah, and I want to read the story of how that turned around, you know, cuz that'd be pretty interesting.

241
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:09,379
Rym: Plus the old Lupin he's a lot less careful with the lives of others.

242
00:18:09,982 --> 00:18:12,113
Scott: Well in the manga he's just he just kills people.

243
00:18:12,153 --> 00:18:13,581
Scott: Yeah, right cuz he's a bad dude like.

244
00:18:13,681 --> 00:18:27,793
Rym: one of the examples in this pilot of how cool Lupin is is He's in a plane and it lands on top of a car and then he jumps out out of the car and the plane flies Away, then he throws a stick of dynamite through the window of the car and he jumps off the car And then the car explodes and goes off a cliff.

245
00:18:28,196 --> 00:18:35,067
Scott: Yep He's a he when you're when you're a thief like that I mean, I guess I don't know.

246
00:18:35,108 --> 00:18:42,910
Scott: just easier to just kill all the guys in your way and then later when they made Lupin I guess more The hero kind of guy.

247
00:18:43,433 --> 00:18:43,835
Scott: I don't know.

248
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:57,032
Scott: maybe They wanted Lupin to be like you like him even though he's a bastard and then later They wanted to make him not a bastard and you like him because he's cool I mean still kind of a bastard kind of.

249
00:18:57,112 --> 00:18:58,237
Scott: but he steals things.

250
00:18:58,318 --> 00:19:01,969
Scott: but then like You always see like when he steals crazy stuff.

251
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:07,268
Scott: He'll always give it back or he'll drop it or yeah He doesn't actually steal like where you go.

252
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:08,372
Scott: Hey, you stole that.

253
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:09,838
Rym: you'll never see the TV show the TV show.

254
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,826
Rym: He steals things from people and keeps them.

255
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:13,272
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

256
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,040
Rym: The movies are really where it's different.

257
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:20,620
Rym: It's like every movie he tries to steal something but then he ends up helping someone out and doing the right thing every time.

258
00:19:21,044 --> 00:19:28,633
Scott: yeah, even if he doesn't want to I Guess that's just what they you know need to do in a movie to sell it I guess because people wouldn't go see it.

259
00:19:28,673 --> 00:19:36,080
Rym: Otherwise, I don't know There are more Lupin movies than I have seen and I have seen a lot of Lupin movies.

260
00:19:36,401 --> 00:19:42,579
Scott: I think we've almost actually seen all the movies except for like a few of the TV Ones and even a lot of those we've seen.

261
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:46,981
Scott: We need to see more the TV and we need to read manga because we haven't written any manga at all Yep.

262
00:19:47,503 --> 00:19:47,844
Scott: All right.

263
00:19:48,506 --> 00:19:55,139
Scott: So the other thing we watch you watch the the first Galaxy Express 999 movie which I've only seen one other time in my life.

264
00:19:55,341 --> 00:19:59,060
Rym: Yep, I saw parts of it on the sci-fi channel when I was in like sixth grade.

265
00:19:59,261 --> 00:20:05,883
Scott: I saw the whole thing on the sci-fi channel sometime in middle school or high school or I don't even remember but Watching it again.

266
00:20:05,903 --> 00:20:17,289
Scott: I Saw it, but that's probably just because I've seen a thousand hundred anime since then But it was still really really good.

267
00:20:17,872 --> 00:20:19,580
Rym: Yeah, it was most excellent.

268
00:20:20,203 --> 00:20:27,345
Rym: I'm very much starting to become a fan of this whole my tell Harlock Arcadia Story the emeraldus.

269
00:20:27,546 --> 00:20:35,518
Scott: Yeah queen emeraldus Galaxy Express all that stuff is in the same universe even though it's like a bunch of separate stuff, but it's way cool.

270
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:44,140
Scott: and You know, I remember that I There were some things that I remember that didn't happen and some things that happen that I didn't remember.

271
00:20:44,441 --> 00:20:47,796
Scott: You know whenever you watch something and then watch it again like a hundred years later.

272
00:20:47,837 --> 00:20:49,203
Scott: that always happens Like.

273
00:20:49,243 --> 00:20:55,670
Scott: I remember there being more explanation about like the mystery of the train But in fact, there was none of that when I watched it again.

274
00:20:56,353 --> 00:21:00,069
Rym: Well, there was one quick explanation Why does it look like an old train?

275
00:21:00,411 --> 00:21:01,960
Rym: Oh, they made it to look like an old train.

276
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,280
Rym: It's actually an advanced spaceship

277
00:21:03,365 --> 00:21:14,432
Scott: No but I remember there being like explanations about like how the train worked and like what was going on inside of it and why it was the way it was and Where it came from and all that kind of stuff, uh-huh That might have been one of the other movies.

278
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:19,080
Scott: I don't know but I'm Obviously, I remembered wrong because there was none of that in this movie.

279
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,507
Rym: Regardless, it's an excellent movie though.

280
00:21:22,627 --> 00:21:26,460
Rym: It tries to cover a lot in less time than it probably should have spent.

281
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:34,102
Scott: Yeah That's the one problem I had with it is that it started out where he's going to get the the count right at the at The time castle.

282
00:21:34,283 --> 00:21:37,732
Rym: Yeah, there's this count Mecca who murdered his mother for fun.

283
00:21:38,314 --> 00:21:46,305
Scott: And he's the movie is about him seeking vengeance and You know that wraps up Like before the end of the movie.

284
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:51,139
Scott: and then there's this added on bit and the added on bit is like the actual.

285
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:55,939
Scott: I guess The message of the movie is like, you know, kind of they say it for sure at the end there.

286
00:21:56,984 --> 00:22:01,855
Scott: but it felt like You know something ended and you were ready for the movie to end and then there was more.

287
00:22:02,136 --> 00:22:11,848
Rym: but see I like that because to Me I got the feeling of a lot of movies just end and they ended like the cloud right after the climax when the plot is Resolved but they never really deal with the aftermath.

288
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:21,035
Rym: and I really like this movie really goes into Wow You've completed this goal that you've been searching for most of your cognizant life to complete now.

289
00:22:21,075 --> 00:22:22,900
Rym: What yeah, what do you do now?

290
00:22:23,221 --> 00:22:25,473
Scott: I guess it's okay because it's not so bad.

291
00:22:25,674 --> 00:22:31,514
Scott: It's kind of like a square boss You know, like you beat the final boss and there's another boss.

292
00:22:31,855 --> 00:22:38,599
Scott: Oh my god secret boss You know, it's that kind of thing which can be fun as long as it's not overdone.

293
00:22:39,622 --> 00:22:42,140
Rym: Final Fantasy 4 advanced there are like five square boss.

294
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:44,556
Rym: It's like a square boss of a square boss of a square boss.

295
00:22:44,858 --> 00:22:48,271
Scott: great Not like Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles with the Oh God.

296
00:22:48,653 --> 00:22:50,640
Scott: Yeah enough square boss is there.

297
00:22:52,435 --> 00:23:03,745
Rym: But Yeah, if you haven't seen Galaxy Express movie highly recommended and moving right along We watched the first episode of samurai Champloo, which is the only samurai Champloo I've actually seen.

298
00:23:04,087 --> 00:23:06,539
Scott: I've seen the whole show and let me say I love the show.

299
00:23:07,263 --> 00:23:08,973
Rym: I gotta say now that I've actually seen it.

300
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:09,899
Rym: I like it.

301
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:13,596
Rym: It pulls it seems to pull a lot of tricks like they'll start to show something.

302
00:23:13,616 --> 00:23:20,351
Rym: They'll be like up wait No, no, never mind or wait back that up now And it jumps around a lot and it's a new.

303
00:23:20,392 --> 00:23:22,459
Rym: it's a style I haven't seen much before and I really like it.

304
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:23,508
Scott: Well, that's really just.

305
00:23:23,548 --> 00:23:24,839
Scott: the first episode is like that.

306
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:35,340
Scott: but the thing is is that each episode has its own different kind of style like and Each episode is like about a different thing altogether even though there is a contiguous plot.

307
00:23:35,421 --> 00:23:38,420
Scott: So this one had the cut back and forth kind of action going on.

308
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:44,820
Scott: Other episodes will kind of have like this, you know, like a weird kind of feeling.

309
00:23:45,442 --> 00:23:53,938
Scott: Others will have more like this fun kind of jovial bouncing around kind of action going on, you know It's always different which is which is what I think makes the show great, huh?

310
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:04,905
Scott: Like and the the greatest part is like they have this great like I don't know if anachronism is the right word thing going on Where it's kind of.

311
00:24:05,306 --> 00:24:09,880
Scott: you know stuff from now at times, but it's all displaced in the past.

312
00:24:10,381 --> 00:24:17,544
Scott: But in the past is also kind of messed up like you've got like hip-hop graffiti spray in.

313
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:28,686
Rym: you know punks back in the ancient times of samurai and You know, the thing is a lot of people seem to forget that in the real world There were punk kids back in Rome.

314
00:24:29,128 --> 00:24:31,254
Rym: There are punk kids in the mice nice civilization.

315
00:24:31,314 --> 00:24:33,180
Rym: punk kids have always been around being punks.

316
00:24:33,781 --> 00:24:36,731
Scott: Yeah, but they're doing specifically punk things like.

317
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:37,594
Rym: what graffiti?

318
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:39,280
Rym: there's graffiti all over in Rome.

319
00:24:40,084 --> 00:24:41,353
Scott: No, but you should wait.

320
00:24:41,373 --> 00:24:42,440
Scott: Do you see these episodes?

321
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:47,395
Scott: It's like a direct clashing of set of ancient samurai culture and modern hip-hop culture.

322
00:24:47,435 --> 00:24:48,679
Scott: That is very fun.

323
00:24:50,164 --> 00:24:55,349
Scott: And of course there is a real actual Plot that gets resolved in the 26th episode.

324
00:24:55,489 --> 00:24:58,520
Rym: Oh, yeah the wanting to find the samurai who smells like sunflowers.

325
00:24:58,821 --> 00:25:02,582
Scott: Yeah, that is the actual plot of the show that that does end I like.

326
00:25:02,642 --> 00:25:07,820
Rym: it's actually a typical mysterious anime plot that lets the show go on while being vague enough to not constrain it.

327
00:25:07,961 --> 00:25:16,080
Scott: Yep, it is a typical Anime plot and when it gets resolved, it's pretty much like you don't even realize that that they've come across it.

328
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,997
Scott: well, I guess he kind of do but not really.

329
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:22,860
Scott: and Pretty good wrap-up, you know, it's nothing like crazy.

330
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:29,239
Scott: It's not like other animes where you know, you have this great buildup and it's like oh my god.

331
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:29,600
Scott: Here it is.

332
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,411
Scott: Oh my god, it's like they've been looking for the thing.

333
00:25:32,451 --> 00:25:33,495
Scott: They've been looking for the thing.

334
00:25:33,515 --> 00:25:34,800
Scott: They've been looking for the thing.

335
00:25:35,443 --> 00:25:37,132
Scott: There it is and we're done.

336
00:25:37,675 --> 00:25:38,098
Scott: that was great.

337
00:25:38,118 --> 00:25:40,265
Rym: I Really like the characters.

338
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:40,967
Rym: from what I've seen.

339
00:25:41,028 --> 00:25:49,091
Rym: the two main samurai guys just have this edgy Adversarial funny dialogue kind of vibe that I enjoy.

340
00:25:49,111 --> 00:25:49,372
Rym: Yeah.

341
00:25:49,392 --> 00:25:51,780
Scott: Well, it's spike Spiegel and a serious guy.

342
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,332
Scott: Yeah, basically like an avid Costello kind of thing though.

343
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:57,625
Rym: It seems like a slightly less Intelligent spike Spiegel.

344
00:25:58,006 --> 00:26:02,380
Scott: No, he's pretty smart and he actually has some history that's revealed and stuff.

345
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:10,413
Scott: But you know, it's like actually you could think of it isn't like spike Spiegel split in half Like there's the crazy kind of one guy looks just like him.

346
00:26:10,473 --> 00:26:17,113
Scott: That's the guy we're talking about Mugen and He's the kind of crazy fun loose guy.

347
00:26:17,173 --> 00:26:20,362
Scott: and the other guy is like the serious samurai You know.

348
00:26:20,443 --> 00:26:25,400
Scott: and spike Spiegel is like Mugen with more seriousness and intelligence.

349
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:29,200
Scott: So if you take that seriousness out and you put that in the gin character.

350
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,540
Scott: It's kind of like that because it is made by the cowboy bebop guy

351
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:44,824
Rym: Yeah, which is really really evident whenever there's a fight scene because they fight just like how we bebop people fight Yep, jumping around kind of hip-hop Kicking their feet around like a monkey Kung-fu action

352
00:26:45,085 --> 00:26:47,414
Scott: and the animation is all the same style and everything.

353
00:26:47,434 --> 00:26:47,514
Scott: Yeah.

354
00:26:47,575 --> 00:26:52,032
Scott: Yeah, and But the the main care I guess she's the main character.

355
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:53,680
Scott: foo is really cute and funny.

356
00:26:54,021 --> 00:26:54,905
Rym: Yeah, she's also.

357
00:26:54,965 --> 00:26:55,467
Rym: what I like.

358
00:26:55,567 --> 00:27:07,471
Rym: is I like the fact that while she's a typical cute funny female lead in an anime You even from the first episode you can tell that one she's smart And two she does think she does the right thing.

359
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:12,137
Rym: in a situation like two guys are fighting with swords She gets the hell out of that room Yep.

360
00:27:13,002 --> 00:27:18,980
Scott: Or like later when she's like I have to free those guys and then she goes and gets some fireworks from the firework maker.

361
00:27:22,302 --> 00:27:23,284
Scott: She can't fight with a sword.

362
00:27:23,325 --> 00:27:24,448
Scott: she goes to buy some fireworks.

363
00:27:24,528 --> 00:27:26,253
Scott: boom crazy stuff happens.

364
00:27:26,534 --> 00:27:27,577
Rym: Yeah, I like her.

365
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:37,119
Rym: Yeah, very cool All right, so that was kind of a short anime episode But we're kind of in the middle of watching a bunch of new anime so we can talk about it.

366
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,380
Scott: Yep, and not only that but it's the week in between Christmas and New Year's which means not much is going on.

367
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,600
Scott: And you know, we got less listeners less action, but that's to be expected.

368
00:27:47,981 --> 00:27:49,285
Scott: Yeah ring a week like this.

369
00:27:49,947 --> 00:27:50,187
Rym: Also.

370
00:27:50,228 --> 00:27:54,300
Rym: We've been rather busy planning a crazy New Year's bash for all our friends.

371
00:27:54,741 --> 00:27:56,166
Scott: Yep, it's gonna be pretty crazy.

372
00:27:56,287 --> 00:28:00,623
Rym: all our friends who don't freakin RSVP and we don't know have no idea how many people are Actually coming.

373
00:28:00,643 --> 00:28:01,366
Rym: Yeah.

374
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:04,359
Scott: Well, hey, you know RSVP you get what you get.

375
00:28:05,245 --> 00:28:10,631
Rym: One thing we've learned is when we were in college We always wanted to throw big parties, but we never.

376
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:14,879
Rym: none of us had money and all the apartments We had were small like college apartments.

377
00:28:15,522 --> 00:28:21,200
Rym: So parties were always just us sitting around and then we'd all like scrounge up money to get some cheap Chinese food.

378
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:28,400
Rym: Now we're actually throwing a party as in we're providing food like catered food and drinks and all that sort of thing.

379
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:29,497
Rym: And you know what?

380
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,406
Rym: Parties cost money.

381
00:28:31,426 --> 00:28:32,956
Rym: They sure do good God.

382
00:28:34,203 --> 00:28:38,850
Rym: I was trying to figure out how much food my friends could eat in a day and I realized that the answer is indeed All of it.

383
00:28:41,183 --> 00:28:47,870
Rym: Well, they're beating up the two-year-old five-year-olds five-year-olds All right, that might have been a little bit of an inside joke.

384
00:28:48,191 --> 00:28:51,759
Rym: So in lieu of being chastised for it I'll explain very quickly.

385
00:28:52,723 --> 00:29:00,559
Rym: There was a debate on the internet and it has been Immortalized as the longest and yet at the same time most trivial debate that has ever taken place.

386
00:29:01,422 --> 00:29:07,618
Rym: Wow, it went on for tens of thousands of posts across multiple forums over the course of like six months.

387
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:09,346
Scott: Holy crap I didn't realize it was that big.

388
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:10,312
Rym: Oh, it was on Fark.

389
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,438
Rym: He was everywhere.

390
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:29,840
Rym: and basically, the argument was Say you were attacked by a mob of five-year-olds Fearless five-year-olds, so they're just saying someone with the physical power of a five-year-old and Those five-year-olds were given one hour of instruction from some sort of martial arts master.

391
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,639
Rym: You are also given one hour of instruction from martial arts master.

392
00:29:35,301 --> 00:29:41,179
Rym: you're put in a gym and the debate was how many of them could you take out before they took you out?

393
00:29:41,199 --> 00:29:47,456
Rym: and They started defining this very explicitly like well taken out means knocked unconscious and blah blah blah.

394
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:50,668
Rym: no weapons into the do The bodies have knocked out ones disappear.

395
00:29:50,709 --> 00:29:52,416
Rym: Would you eventually drown in five-year-olds?

396
00:29:52,978 --> 00:29:58,059
Rym: Yeah, and That there's nothing more I can really say about that.

397
00:29:58,661 --> 00:30:07,279
Scott: People just argued about this to a crazy degree and the only funny thing you have to remember is the one guy's answer How many five-year-olds could you take out all of them?

398
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,719
Scott: That that's the right answer.

399
00:30:11,224 --> 00:30:14,807
Scott: so as always Go to the forums and hang out.

400
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:17,959
Scott: There's people there actually talking a lot about cool stuff.

401
00:30:18,742 --> 00:30:20,950
Scott: If you go and hang out there, that's cool, too.

402
00:30:21,411 --> 00:30:23,920
Rym: Yep, and we've been working a lot on the audio.

403
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:31,286
Rym: I don't know how much people notice this or not because I think we notice changes in audio a lot more than other people listening Do because we do it.

404
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,600
Rym: but every podcast last week has been different.

405
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:40,925
Rym: I've been playing around with a lot of different methods of cleaning up and different Normalization crap.

406
00:30:41,428 --> 00:30:45,199
Rym: once I figure out what I'm doing really well I'm gonna do a show on it and tell you all how to do it.

407
00:30:45,882 --> 00:30:50,659
Rym: But for now if one episode sounds particularly good or particularly bad let us know.

408
00:30:51,241 --> 00:30:55,960
Scott: Yeah, let us know all kinds of stuff because really no one lets us know anything about this podcast.

409
00:30:56,381 --> 00:31:00,952
Rym: Yeah, nice at gmail.com or call that phone number the phone number.

410
00:31:00,972 --> 00:31:02,336
Scott: We forgot again great.

411
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:03,539
Scott: I'm gonna write it down.

412
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:06,072
Rym: Don't worry It's on the website.

413
00:31:06,476 --> 00:31:10,871
Rym: Yeah But really let us know because while I test.

414
00:31:11,332 --> 00:31:14,420
Rym: I test on small samples because these filters take a long time to run.

415
00:31:14,561 --> 00:31:23,997
Rym: so I'll get like a two-minute wave of us talking and I'll fiddle with and try to see what I can do and Then I have to end up applying these things to very long wave files and it takes a long time to do.

416
00:31:24,017 --> 00:31:30,000
Rym: and I don't Have time every night to sit there and listen to every podcast to see how it sounds in its entirety.

417
00:31:30,961 --> 00:31:39,419
Rym: So it might like what a filter I come up with might work really well in one spot But then it breaks later on when we're both talking at the same time or Scott breathes into the mic again.

418
00:31:40,641 --> 00:31:42,212
Rym: That happens Darth Scott.

419
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:52,116
Rym: Oh Um your Podcaster that was not funny.

420
00:31:52,196 --> 00:31:52,637
Scott: No kidding.

421
00:31:52,657 --> 00:31:56,026
Rym: You know what have been funny if this is a diplomatic podcast.

422
00:31:56,086 --> 00:31:57,490
Rym: Where is the ambassador?

423
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:01,395
Scott: I'm the ambassador Whatever.

424
00:32:01,516 --> 00:32:20,729
Rym: yeah, but stay tuned tomorrow because we watched Star Wars four or five and six over the past week and we're gonna do a show on Star Wars and That was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

425
00:32:21,071 --> 00:32:23,320
Rym: special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music.
