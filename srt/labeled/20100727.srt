15
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:10,276

Rym: I was drunk during it.

17
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:11,924
Scott: I was so drunk.

18
00:01:15,184 --> 00:01:17,263
Scott: If he's the one selling stuff shouldn't he be paying us?

19
00:01:17,284 --> 00:01:21,542
Rym: because we were going to like wait in the bar and meet everybody and hang out with some people in Our K?

20
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,274
Rym: and then that didn't happen and I was the only one who got my drink.

Scott: You have both guys.

Jared: I didn't bring one.

62
00:03:21,445 --> 00:03:22,530
Rym: So rapidly we get behind.

63
00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:26,429
Scott: Clearly he's making games faster than I can play them.

64
00:03:26,871 --> 00:03:36,530
Rym: So, I guess we should get started with kind of the obvious topic because it's a. it's a point of debate among our listeners among Us sometimes at panels between awesome people in the audience.

65
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,660
Rym: What is a role-playing game?

66
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:44,010
Scott: There's a question like mean something different when you say it like that?

67
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,255
Rym: Yes, it's like a game show.

68
00:03:45,295 --> 00:03:48,209
Rym: question then like who is the father?

69
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,122
Luke: Not any of us I don't think trying to tell us something.

70
00:03:53,242 --> 00:03:54,869
Jared: I don't think that game shows been invented yet.

71
00:03:56,193 --> 00:03:57,360
Jared: Although that's gold.

72
00:03:57,381 --> 00:04:00,793
Jared: that is fucking gold We don't know.

73
00:04:00,813 --> 00:04:02,799
Luke: Wait, I saw an episode of it when I was in Japan.

74
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:14,416
Rym: Oh So, what is a role-playing game?

75
00:04:14,637 --> 00:04:15,741
Rym: I guess we should actually talk about it.

76
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:16,966
Jared: really do we care?

77
00:04:17,226 --> 00:04:17,890
Jared: does anybody care?

78
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:21,120
Rym: I think people do because a lot if nothing else it will.

79
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,734
Scott: it will spawn us into discussing something else more interesting when we find Tangents.

80
00:04:24,794 --> 00:04:26,123
Scott: that is interest, you know quality.

81
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:30,479
Luke: Okay, so Talisman, that's the best role-playing game ever design.

82
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:31,924
Jared: It's a role-playing game talisman.

83
00:04:32,466 --> 00:04:38,114
Scott: I don't even what is talisman games workshop Game from the 80s?

Scott: Really?

87
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:52,204

Scott: Oh, wow So do you have to paint the managers?

00:04:54,798 --> 00:04:55,924
Scott: this is a games workshop game.

90
00:04:55,944 --> 00:05:02,810
Jared: no Do have some lead figures that you can buy for it, but it comes with little hard stock counters.

91
00:05:05,592 --> 00:05:07,458
Scott: Make this game because I know like they reissued it.

92
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,445
Jared: fantasy flight games maybe last year.

93
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:10,930
Scott: Oh fantasy advertisement.

94
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:11,552

Jared: It's canal called talisman by fantasy flight.

97
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:20,290
Scott: Sometimes you'll get like a reissue of a game and they change the title of it.

98
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,040
Jared: But it's really strangely enough in the 21st century.

99
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:36,024
Jared: I think it's still cost the same as it did in a 1980 Possibly one of the worst gameplay experiences I've ever had or the best Which defines it as a role-playing like a hero quest type of thing.

100
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,210
Scott: Does it differ from hero quest?

101
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:45,861
Luke: I was very similar very similar or Warhammer quest or Dungeon dungeons actually the first role-playing game dungeon also.

102
00:05:46,603 --> 00:05:47,405
Scott: What's what's dungeon?

103
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:49,070
Jared: Is that talisman light?

104
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:55,138
Luke: Designed by Gygax and Arneson board game levels.

105
00:05:55,178 --> 00:05:58,146
Scott: Did they make that before D&D or after after?

106
00:05:58,788 --> 00:05:59,329
Scott: so you're so.

107
00:05:59,489 --> 00:05:59,710
Scott: so wait.

108
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,820
Scott: You said that that was like the first role-playing game.

109
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,950
Scott: So D&D original D&D was not a role-playing game.

110
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:04,574
Scott: Is that what you're saying?

111
00:06:04,755 --> 00:06:05,097
Jared: Correct?

112
00:06:05,621 --> 00:06:06,104
Scott: So what?

113
00:06:06,184 --> 00:06:07,030
Jared: it is a simulation.

114
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:12,990
Jared: It's a tactical tactical simulation skirmish based man-to-man fighting.

115
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:15,018
Scott: So what is what about it?

116
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:17,087
Scott: makes it not a role-playing game?

117
00:06:17,328 --> 00:06:17,810
Jared: No kissing.

118
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:20,537
Scott: There's no kissing in talisman.

119
00:06:20,597 --> 00:06:21,219
Jared: there is kissing.

120
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,985
Scott: yes, how do you how?

121
00:06:23,026 --> 00:06:24,290
Scott: you said it's a lot like hero quest.

122
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:32,138
Jared: There's all sorts of stuff in talisman But you've changed.

123
00:06:32,178 --> 00:06:33,730
Scott: it's not no longer the hero quest anymore.

124
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,473
Scott: It's not a different game.

125
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:36,100
Scott: because you've changed the rules.

126
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:39,156
Scott: like if I play monopoly with money on free parking It's not monopoly.

127
00:06:39,176 --> 00:06:40,468
Jared: It's your request in a pink box.

128
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:46,743
Luke: yeah, so wait what if I Every time I get a hearts card in poker if I kiss you?

129
00:06:46,763 --> 00:06:47,949
Luke: doesn't make it a role-playing game.

130
00:06:49,194 --> 00:06:50,369
Jared: Makes it more disturbing game.

131
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:53,266
Luke: How do you turn poker into a role-playing game?

132
00:06:55,032 --> 00:06:56,263

133
00:06:57,715 --> 00:06:58,765

00:07:03,404 --> 00:07:04,408
Jared: He had this really cool game.

136
00:07:04,448 --> 00:07:04,870
Jared: I don't think he ever.

137
00:07:05,836 --> 00:07:06,400
Scott: You played that game.

138
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,205
Rym: I played that game.

139
00:07:07,225 --> 00:07:07,889
Scott: scary people.

140
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:12,830
Rym: I played that game with perhaps the scariest people we've ever known I've ever encountered in my life.

141
00:07:13,192 --> 00:07:26,809
Scott: I'm pretty sure he never actually raped a child, but otherwise Wow, this is a dude where if you just if he brought up a conversation He basically he would brag to you about he how he knew and memorized the age of consent in all 50 states.

142
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:29,448
Jared: Yeah, I think I know that guy too.

143
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:32,170
Jared: But someone like him someone with his gene line.

144
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:46,189
Rym: Basically I spent like four hours making this character with this long introduction And I was killed in one hit by the first thing we encountered and that was the end It's Bushido played of role-playing games.

145
00:07:46,951 --> 00:07:48,149
Jared: What's that's that's good?

146
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:49,699
Jared: We need more of that.

147
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,588
Jared: We need more one-shot kill.

148
00:07:52,252 --> 00:07:54,241
Rym: What makes a good role-playing game?

149
00:07:54,764 --> 00:07:58,637
Jared: Oh now our names on the box Boom.

150
00:07:58,657 --> 00:07:59,681
Luke: that's completely different.

151
00:07:59,701 --> 00:08:01,770
Luke: So what is a role-playing game versus what is a good role-playing game?

152
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,500
Jared: I mean a good role-playing game is very different.

153
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,727
Luke: different question exactly.

154
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:08,434
Rym: So It makes a good role-playing game.

155
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:11,225
Rym: like for you, like what do you say Luke is a good role-playing game?

156
00:08:11,245 --> 00:08:14,253
Luke: Oh Oh my like.

157
00:08:14,273 --> 00:08:15,096
Rym: what are the elements like?

158
00:08:15,196 --> 00:08:16,521
Rym: what makes it good versus bad?

159
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:19,170
Rym: Like why is D&D so unsatisfying?

160
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:19,990
Rym: Well, I say all right.

161
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:27,284
Scott: So if I'm if I'm a if I'm if I'm some punk kid who thinks he knows how to write a role-playing game Right, you're wrong and you are all right.

162
00:08:27,365 --> 00:08:28,170
Scott: Okay, so you're wrong.

163
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:35,250
Scott: So so I write a game and I say, you know, let's say you were it was like, you know You're in like a the way comic people like look at people's portfolios.

164
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,470
Scott: I give the game to you and I'm like, oh you will you critique my game and tell me where I went wrong?

165
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,462
Scott: You know, what would be like the things that you look for first?

166
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:43,977
Jared: We have a list.

167
00:08:44,217 --> 00:08:55,195
Luke: if you're a role-playing game had creation myths in it and a fighting system and Character creation and a magic system.

168
00:08:55,777 --> 00:09:00,590
Luke: I think that would be where at the point at which I'd tell you you steered yourself a little.

169
00:09:01,632 --> 00:09:03,427
Luke: Perhaps you might want to go back to the drawing board.

170
00:09:05,532 --> 00:09:15,826
Luke: For me a modern role-playing game has to have Some form of mechanical resolution for well it needs.

171
00:09:15,926 --> 00:09:16,970
Jared: it needs player agency.

172
00:09:17,952 --> 00:09:18,293
Jared: It needs.

173
00:09:18,535 --> 00:09:20,303
Scott: so what I say for what is player agency?

174
00:09:20,323 --> 00:09:21,850
Scott: because people listening probably have no idea.

175
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:28,169
Jared: the player has to be able to make meaningful choices and have a have a right effect on Events in the world.

176
00:09:34,131 --> 00:09:36,246
Jared: Well, that's that's a. that's a choice.

177
00:09:36,346 --> 00:09:36,749
Jared: that's good.

178
00:09:37,871 --> 00:09:38,897
Jared: It's better than no choice.

179
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:40,144
Luke: It's but it's not.

180
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:41,069
Jared: but it's not really.

181
00:09:42,191 --> 00:09:42,673
Luke: It's not enough.

182
00:09:42,853 --> 00:09:43,355
Luke: It's it's.

183
00:09:43,496 --> 00:09:45,925
Luke: it's not enough for for a contemporary role-playing game.

184
00:09:45,945 --> 00:09:47,410
Jared: You have to make emotional.

185
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,270
Jared: Well, basically what you have to do is you have to make irrational decisions.

186
00:09:50,491 --> 00:10:04,389
Jared: that's kind of the difference between a role-playing game and a war game is if I'm playing with my Napoleonic miniatures and I decide this guy's gonna kill this guy because he's closer and it's an easier shot That's a lot different than saying this guy's brother was killed in the war by this guy.

187
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,474
Jared: now He's out for revenge.

188
00:10:06,017 --> 00:10:07,162
Jared: then it's a role-playing game.

189
00:10:07,705 --> 00:10:09,332
Jared: You have emotional context You're making.

190
00:10:09,955 --> 00:10:13,790
Jared: you're making suboptimal decisions based on emotional responses.

191
00:10:14,252 --> 00:10:15,757
Luke: I call it player priorities to like.

192
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:31,250
Luke: I feel I feel stupid playing a role-playing game in 2010 if I do not have a place to insert or choose a Priority as a player meaning something that I am interested in as a person that I want my character to do.

193
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:35,510
Luke: I don't give a fuck about my character, you know, I don't give a. I don't care what Rym wants to do.

194
00:10:35,631 --> 00:10:37,914
Luke: I want to be able to say Right.

195
00:10:38,014 --> 00:10:41,370
Luke: I'm playing a dragoon or us a dirty French hussar.

196
00:10:43,531 --> 00:10:45,754
Rym: I Thought about that stupid like.

197
00:10:45,774 --> 00:10:46,154
Rym: what's a game?

198
00:10:46,175 --> 00:10:56,092
Scott: that the rail shooter with the dragon is like Legend of Dragoons, I think it's Anyway.

199
00:10:56,132 --> 00:11:01,289
Luke: if I'm or is Starcraft or Grune, you know, there's no Shogun warrior named Dragoon.

200
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:04,119
Jared: I'm gonna say there was all right.

201
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:04,762
Luke: I don't think so.

202
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:06,209
Jared: Yeah, I'm gonna say there was shut up.

203
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:09,230
Jared: How dare you don't have the right to dream?

204
00:11:09,531 --> 00:11:27,802
Luke: So, I mean a game should have a role-playing game needs to have not just like Mathematical mechanical resolution But it has to have choices that the player is making based on the emotional content of their character based Plus the situation plus what's going on in the game.

205
00:11:27,842 --> 00:11:39,070
Luke: right if you're not factoring in What you know what the GM has said, you know What the other players have done and presented like basically where what what's going on in this in this space between us like where?

206
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:51,900
Luke: All the characters, you know, why am I doing this if you're not factoring factoring that into a role and the game isn't reinforcing that decision with okay if you go this way if you make this decision Then this thing happens.

207
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:52,666
Luke: you make this decision.

208
00:11:52,706 --> 00:11:53,551
Luke: this thing happens If you.

209
00:11:54,554 --> 00:12:09,810
Luke: if you make no decision this thing happens, right like a nun like if you choose to stand null whatever the game has to insert itself into the situation and Either there has to be an instruction for another player or there has to be some kind of consequence for those actions.

210
00:12:10,191 --> 00:12:14,690
Jared: Well, the game has a philosophy and it should either coincide with or conflict with your own philosophy.

211
00:12:17,212 --> 00:12:19,639
Rym: Your own philosophy is a player or your characters philosophy.

212
00:12:19,659 --> 00:12:21,144
Jared: There's no character in a role-playing game.

213
00:12:21,164 --> 00:12:21,987
Jared: There are no characters.

214
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:22,689
Jared: They're only players.

215
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,427
Jared: Anybody who says that's what my character should that's what my character would do is weird.

216
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:32,030
Rym: It should probably go to a hospital that I've noticed that a lot and you always talk about like turtling.

217
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:37,456
Rym: I got a break hit like someone who's like they're starting to roll play and then they like turtle and just sit there and like Let all the events pass by.

218
00:12:37,476 --> 00:12:41,373
Rym: but I found that almost the opposite situation happens I don't know what to call it.

219
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:45,710
Rym: where someone starts to internalize all the role-playing to the point that they're kind of being quiet.

220
00:12:45,792 --> 00:13:00,767
Rym: It looks like they're turtling but really they're like role-playing all this BS about their own character out in their head and then they have some sort of rationale like suddenly they jump in like I stabbed that guy because that's what my character would have done and they use my Character would have done it as an excuse to just be obstructionist.

221
00:13:00,787 --> 00:13:04,229
Luke: Yeah We have less nice names for those guys.

222
00:13:13,712 --> 00:13:14,294
Jared: Is it a troche?

223
00:13:14,735 --> 00:13:16,099
Luke: no, no that no.

224
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,109
Luke: the turtle just sits there and does nothing.

225
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:19,510
Luke: the roach.

226
00:13:20,631 --> 00:13:24,144
Luke: Like when the spotlights not on the player, they're running around doing everything.

227
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:25,108
Luke: you're talking to that player.

228
00:13:25,148 --> 00:13:32,555
Luke: next to them There's oh, oh, oh, they look like they want to do something and then as soon as the the whatever the spotlight of the game Turn they got nothing.

229
00:13:32,575 --> 00:13:33,499
Luke: Yeah, they just cuz they're a roach.

230
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,251
Scott: They run or they scurry into the darkness as soon as the light is On them.

231
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:36,512
Luke: Yes.

232
00:13:36,553 --> 00:13:39,665
Scott: Yes, but when it's dark, they're moving around getting all busy.

233
00:13:39,705 --> 00:13:39,926
Scott: Yeah.

234
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:40,287
Jared: Yeah.

235
00:13:40,307 --> 00:13:40,387
Jared: Yeah.

236
00:13:41,691 --> 00:13:42,212
Jared: So word for the.

237
00:13:42,513 --> 00:13:55,830
Scott: so this is a word for the player who just internalizes everything they're playing but only in their own mind and they're doing The guy who comes and he's got like a whole book of backstory written and like as you're playing he's like writing even more.

238
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:58,824
Rym: The first gaming kind ever went to Michicon.

239
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:08,700
Rym: I was like 11 I think and I went to this gaming kind of played D&D like for all night with all these old guys and one guy like runs Into a god and the gods like what is your desire?

240
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,476
Rym: and all the players are like tell like tell him like out of character You should do this.

241
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:12,939
Rym: You should do this.

242
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:13,865
Rym: No, we're trying to win this thing.

243
00:14:13,906 --> 00:14:14,510
Rym: It's a competition.

244
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:19,785
Rym: Let's go and he goes through this big notebook He brought with him finds a piece of paper like flips through.

245
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:27,767
Rym: it finds like one paragraph Circles it hands it to the game master and the game master reads it and just looks up to him Like what is wrong with you?

246
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:32,694
Luke: And he had it all planned out like if my character should ever meet a god ask for this.

247
00:14:33,056 --> 00:14:37,255
Rym: and it asked about all this stuff about his character's backstory and all this Fulfillment and all this.

248
00:14:37,516 --> 00:14:39,243
Rym: it looked like he had a great story in his head.

249
00:14:39,363 --> 00:14:41,050
Luke: But so wait, so let's back up.

250
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,866
Luke: I actually think it's a little disingenuous to say that there's no character.

251
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:49,550
Luke: I will often Like I will toot that horn and say, you know, there's only a player there's no character.

252
00:14:49,851 --> 00:14:59,910
Luke: I also think it's very dishonest thing for a for a player to say Well, that's what my character would do and to not recognize that there are three or four other people at the table all with their own needs priorities desires.

253
00:15:01,091 --> 00:15:07,630
Luke: But I mean you can make decisions within the framework of a character that you've built.

254
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:08,354
Luke: Sure, right.

255
00:15:08,394 --> 00:15:21,809
Luke: You can you can say hey I have made you know, I have built this little mask this this structure here and Most appropriate response.

256
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:24,540
Luke: Right, that's what my character would do.

257
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:24,640
Jared: Yeah.

258
00:15:24,781 --> 00:15:24,941
Jared: Yeah.

259
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:25,865
Jared: What would I do in a fight?

260
00:15:25,945 --> 00:15:26,347
Jared: I'd run.

261
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:27,230
Jared: what would my character do?

262
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,558
Jared: He'd probably fight because he's trained or something.

263
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:37,535
Jared: So yeah, I mean, of course there's that but there's no There's no Schizophrenic kind of.

264
00:15:37,555 --> 00:15:40,910
Jared: oh, I'm gonna make decisions based on this fictional character.

265
00:15:41,011 --> 00:15:47,250
Jared: That's gonna not only clash with the other players But also clash with which is with with what I want to do as a player.

266
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:48,880
Jared: Because oh that was my character would do.

267
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,765
Jared: my character would do something.

268
00:15:49,786 --> 00:15:51,354
Jared: That's not fun It's the classic.

269
00:15:51,394 --> 00:15:52,258
Jared: my character would go home.

270
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:53,524
Jared: My character wouldn't be an adventurer.

271
00:15:53,544 --> 00:15:54,689
Jared: Yeah, but you're playing a game.

272
00:15:55,316 --> 00:15:56,449
Jared: Yeah, you made a character.

273
00:15:57,432 --> 00:15:58,621
Jared: He's going to be an adventurer.

274
00:15:58,661 --> 00:15:59,044
Jared: deal with it.

275
00:15:59,084 --> 00:15:59,789
Jared: Yeah, but he's a cook.

276
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:01,359
Jared: I always got this in games.

277
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:07,954
Jared: in D&D games that one guy who's like I'm gonna be a cook Rym those are in once and I'm gonna carry a frying pan instead of a Pacifist.

278
00:16:07,995 --> 00:16:12,235
Scott: I don't want to do the boring combat Because I hated the combat.

279
00:16:12,255 --> 00:16:13,720
Rym: so basically combat would start.

280
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:18,176
Rym: I would go over to the other apartment like counter-strike for like four hours Which is it's.

281
00:16:18,276 --> 00:16:21,650
Jared: that's a bad game because you as a pacifist you you made a decision.

282
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,430
Jared: You should have consequences for that decision.

283
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,821
Jared: You shouldn't be able to just disengage with the game pull out and go.

284
00:16:26,162 --> 00:16:28,171
Jared: well this part's not for me Right.

285
00:16:28,232 --> 00:16:33,733
Luke: if the game lets you make a pacifist character the game should speak to you as a pacifist Player.

286
00:16:33,934 --> 00:16:41,564
Luke: as a player of a pacifist character the game should say it should say oh well Then if you're going to do this This is what's going on the game should not exclude you for four hours at a time of play.

287
00:16:41,764 --> 00:16:49,368
Jared: the same example same example Same same condition different example the decker in a cyberpunk game same thing as a pacifist player.

288
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:51,644
Jared: well This isn't about decking so I'm gonna leave.

289
00:16:51,705 --> 00:16:52,290
Luke: aggressive player.

290
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,704
Jared: Yeah, this isn't about decking so I'm gonna leave.

291
00:16:54,724 --> 00:16:58,803
Jared: and meanwhile the decker is like well This isn't about decking so I'm gonna leave I'm gonna go you know catch up on my sleep.

292
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:00,309
Jared: those games are broken.

293
00:17:01,531 --> 00:17:02,274
Rym: So at what?

294
00:17:02,575 --> 00:17:06,550
Rym: what's the line between it being the game masters responsibility to address that versus the game?

295
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,915
Scott: Yeah, what is the game Dean right?

296
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:10,490
Jared: Well cuz the game tells the game master what to do right?

297
00:17:10,771 --> 00:17:14,449
Scott: I mean, but like look at D&D right the the book doesn't really the players handbook.

298
00:17:14,469 --> 00:17:26,869
Scott: at least It doesn't really give the GM that much instruction right, but if you were a pacifist player in D&D right the game master could Force upon some monsters on you forcing you to do something even if you were running away from combat.

299
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:30,285
Scott: He'd like a crazy fast cheetah is coming after you or there's a displacer beast.

300
00:17:30,345 --> 00:17:31,409
Scott: It's faster than you would caught you.

301
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,015
Scott: now What are you gonna do?

302
00:17:32,035 --> 00:17:33,530
Jared: pacifist World of Warcraft?

303
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,858
Jared: Allows you to play a pacifist character.

304
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,424
Scott: How do you level up then?

305
00:17:37,705 --> 00:17:38,649
Jared: it's hard, but you do it.

306
00:17:40,076 --> 00:17:43,532
Jared: In a week I got to level 20.

307
00:17:43,532 --> 00:17:47,283
Jared: No, the only thing I was allowed to kill.

308
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:53,621
Jared: I gave myself the concession I could kill undead But still there's not a lot of undead in the zones.

309
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:54,725
Jared: I played.

310
00:17:54,846 --> 00:17:56,030
Scott: I played the World of Warcraft demo.

311
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:00,110
Scott: I've never played it beyond like a day and I was I don't know.

312
00:18:00,351 --> 00:18:02,401
Scott: I think I was a paladin so pretty much everything was undead.

313
00:18:02,422 --> 00:18:03,004
Scott: It was like scale.

314
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:04,110
Scott: It was like kill 10 skeletons.

315
00:18:04,271 --> 00:18:06,120
Scott: Okay, kill 15 skeletons.

316
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:06,743
Scott: I was like great.

317
00:18:06,864 --> 00:18:07,808
Jared: It's I was doing a.

318
00:18:08,811 --> 00:18:09,829
Luke: Let's back up to the question.

319
00:18:11,075 --> 00:18:14,335
Luke: like Jared said the Right in D&D.

320
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:14,636
Luke: There's.

321
00:18:15,037 --> 00:18:18,990
Luke: there is this kind of void space where you can make anything.

322
00:18:19,111 --> 00:18:23,469
Luke: You can have any philosophy because D&D won't come out and just say no you have to be this.

323
00:18:24,071 --> 00:18:29,267
Jared: This is because there is somebody who can fight and be going adventures be an adventurer.

324
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:32,477
Luke: according to them the mechanism that is D&D.

325
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:38,759
Luke: there are only certain things that you can be that will Allow you to function within the game.

326
00:18:39,222 --> 00:18:40,890
Luke: right you have to kill shit and take its stuff.

327
00:18:41,091 --> 00:18:43,743
Luke: And and if you're not gonna play a character who's gonna kill shit and take its stuff.

328
00:18:44,105 --> 00:18:45,230
Luke: You're going to be miserable.

329
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:46,933
Luke: And you're.

330
00:18:46,954 --> 00:18:48,904
Jared: it's like playing a shadowrunner who won't break the law.

331
00:18:48,964 --> 00:18:49,809
Jared: I'm not gonna break the law.

332
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:51,337
Jared: well You're going to be staying home.

333
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:51,437
Jared: Well.

334
00:18:52,161 --> 00:18:53,790
Luke: I want to play a cop screaming shadowrun.

335
00:18:54,713 --> 00:18:55,627
Luke: You're the only one.

336
00:18:57,731 --> 00:19:04,320
Rym: I've seen that as the opposite problem too where we'd often you know before we found burning wheel and even any other game that wasn't D&D or basically GURPS.

337
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,870
Rym: you know just D&D with different numbers.

338
00:19:06,492 --> 00:19:15,843
Rym: we would try to play these very like politically driven intrigue like we're all diplomats, and we'd use the D&D rules and Obviously that didn't work, so we basically roll diplomacy all the time.

339
00:19:16,084 --> 00:19:17,028
Luke: well right because the game won.

340
00:19:17,471 --> 00:19:23,363
Luke: The game won't come out and just tell you what it's about Right and say this is the best way to play this game and also the players.

341
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:31,466
Jared: a lot of players refuse to admit that the Game, they've loved for so many years It's probably kind of bad and that they've turned into a game that they love.

342
00:19:31,646 --> 00:19:32,550
Jared: the game itself is written.

343
00:19:33,234 --> 00:19:34,966
Jared: It's not a good game, but they're like no.

344
00:19:35,006 --> 00:19:35,530
Jared: I love this game.

345
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:43,005
Jared: I've been playing it since I was 13. no you've been playing your own hack of it with all this crazy intrigue and political Machination mechanics, it's like monopoly and free parking.

346
00:19:43,045 --> 00:19:43,749
Luke: right yeah.

347
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:51,010
Scott: So I guess you wouldn't consider Final Fantasy in RPG right because you don't make any decisions.

348
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:56,249
Scott: You just basically you know this combat, and it's just a strategy, and if you lose you just start over you don't you know?

349
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:57,153
Rym: There's?

350
00:19:57,516 --> 00:19:58,562
Scott: no there's no decisions.

351
00:19:58,582 --> 00:19:59,809
Jared: That's a computer game.

352
00:20:01,053 --> 00:20:04,684
Jared: I don't know if I think computer RPGs are inspired by RPGs, but they're.

353
00:20:05,507 --> 00:20:05,988
Jared: who knows?

354
00:20:06,028 --> 00:20:06,610
Luke: that's a tough one.

355
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,012
Luke: I mean you're.

356
00:20:07,253 --> 00:20:11,109
Luke: I mean is there any embodiment in any identification avatar identification?

357
00:20:11,149 --> 00:20:12,821
Luke: there I feel like you're that person.

358
00:20:12,861 --> 00:20:18,649
Rym: you feel like you're making no Trigger which is a very separate example.

359
00:20:20,431 --> 00:20:22,118
Scott: You're supposed to be chrono and the other.

360
00:20:22,178 --> 00:20:25,110
Scott: the other characters are supposed to be sort of supporting characters.

361
00:20:25,452 --> 00:20:34,369
Scott: Right and there are multiple endings based on things you do In different parts of the game though the rest of it is largely extremely similar to Final Fantasy.

362
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:41,402
Jared: well I mean if you look at some popular and successful well-made games There is an element of embodiment.

363
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:43,854
Jared: I mean when you're playing half-life You are not a badass.

364
00:20:43,894 --> 00:20:45,880
Jared: you are a physicist and up in a suit.

365
00:20:46,221 --> 00:20:56,190
Jared: if you're playing thief, and you're playing this is name Eric I forget God begins with a G whatever, but um you are not a badass swordsman.

366
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:59,911
Jared: You're a dude who hides in the shadows and waits for people to walk by and then you club them in the back of the Head.

367
00:21:00,212 --> 00:21:04,588
Jared: that's great because it enforces you to play a certain way, which mirrors the character however.

368
00:21:04,688 --> 00:21:05,270
Jared: Are you feeling?

369
00:21:07,551 --> 00:21:16,489
Jared: You know loss or longing or any of these emotions that the that the characters feeling I Mean maybe in the way that you you feel for a character that you're reading about in a book.

370
00:21:17,391 --> 00:21:34,206
Rym: Well the argument I get most from people who say that our role-playing games and a lot of people in panels will ask this question They say that you couldn't just make it a movie You know even though it's just a single narrative because the time invested alone Makes you identify with the character and feel like you're making these decisions even when you're not

371
00:21:34,366 --> 00:21:35,390
Luke: the sunk cost fallacy.

372
00:21:37,851 --> 00:21:39,998
Rym: It's hard to argue with you guys, let's let's.

373
00:21:40,118 --> 00:21:43,590
Jared: uh let's actually let's call Roger Ebert so we can get him in on this conversation.

374
00:21:45,235 --> 00:21:46,157
Scott: I don't even know.

375
00:21:46,197 --> 00:21:48,363
Scott: he's never played a video game right, so I don't really.

376
00:21:48,464 --> 00:21:51,895
Scott: I don't even knows a tabletop RPG exists Or how it works.

377
00:21:52,176 --> 00:21:54,927
Jared: He actually has a copy of one of my games really.

378
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:55,590
Scott: How do you know this?

379
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:56,499
Jared: I gave it to him.

380
00:21:56,824 --> 00:21:58,834
Scott: really We need to start.

381
00:21:58,854 --> 00:21:59,397
Scott: so when did you?

382
00:21:59,437 --> 00:22:01,065
Scott: when did you meet him in person?

383
00:22:01,105 --> 00:22:01,386
Scott: or was it?

384
00:22:01,406 --> 00:22:02,270
Jared: no is it person?

385
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,973
Jared: I went up to him.

386
00:22:03,234 --> 00:22:11,589
Jared: I was on a cruise ship, and he I was at his uh his Festival film festival at sea with uh him in a Richard Roper, and I went up to him.

387
00:22:11,649 --> 00:22:12,372
Jared: I was like hey I did this.

388
00:22:12,433 --> 00:22:17,460
Jared: I know you're a big into pulp and and stuff like that and Here's a copy of octane and against the Reich.

389
00:22:18,043 --> 00:22:20,218
Jared: you know you know I signed it for him and everything I was like you know.

390
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:21,190
Jared: I think you're a great reviewer.

391
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,810
Jared: I really you know admire you blah blah blah and Richard Roper looked at me and said hey, where's mine?

392
00:22:24,871 --> 00:22:27,030
Jared: I said hey, you didn't like sky captain and world of tomorrow.

393
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:32,858
Jared: Yeah, yeah, you'd like.

394
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,670
Jared: Ebert likes anything that has a bold vision.

395
00:22:35,032 --> 00:22:37,790
Jared: It doesn't matter if the story's a little weak as long as it shows him something.

396
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,156
Scott: Yeah, that's I was gonna say is like that's.

397
00:22:39,297 --> 00:22:43,014
Scott: that's basically my opinion of the sky captain is that the story was a little weak But it was like he always.

398
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:48,039
Jared: he always quotes the the quote about the world is starving for new images Which I always like.

399
00:22:48,422 --> 00:22:49,409
Jared: that quote mm-hmm.

400
00:22:49,811 --> 00:23:00,409
Jared: But anyway, yeah Ebert suffering the same the same slings and arrows from his readers about our games are in our games better than movies or the same as movies or Whatever, I don't think we're gonna.

401
00:23:01,234 --> 00:23:01,696
Luke: So it's tough.

402
00:23:01,736 --> 00:23:10,330
Luke: a role-playing game like a tabletop role-playing game allows You know one as simple as D&D allows for such a greater degree of avatar identification for embodiment.

403
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:15,207
Luke: Then partly because you make up the character yourself well you make up the character right.

404
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:16,797
Luke: you were created And you get to.

405
00:23:16,998 --> 00:23:18,430
Luke: you get to form this vision in your head.

406
00:23:18,711 --> 00:23:40,710
Luke: but also part of it like this the sunk cost fallacy is involved in this a little bit to the Number of decisions that you make even in D&D the small just micro decisions that you're constantly making huge like you know Exponentially greater than the decisions that you make in a Final Fantasy style RPG Final Finis because Final Fantasy processes all of the game information for you.

407
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:43,849
Luke: So it's just presenting you with like these really easy like spell or weapon.

408
00:23:44,653 --> 00:23:47,225
Luke: You know this way or that way whereas you know I have to be.

409
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:50,322
Luke: if we're playing D&D I have to constantly negotiate with you guys where we're gonna.

410
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:50,543
Luke: Go.

411
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:51,126
Luke: We're gonna.

412
00:23:51,147 --> 00:23:51,649
Luke: Do I got it?

413
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,756
Luke: Oh, well, what kind of?

414
00:23:52,796 --> 00:23:54,930
Luke: what do I get from this Hall of Treasure?

415
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,169
Luke: We what am I gonna write down?

416
00:23:56,671 --> 00:23:57,515
Luke: We're gonna share with you.

417
00:23:57,596 --> 00:24:06,649
Jared: a D&D character has memories and history associated with it And I tend to think of our computer RPG characters as having levels and like goals and quests that they've accomplished.

418
00:24:08,131 --> 00:24:12,890
Scott: Do you think do you think there is a video game that has memory and history going on?

419
00:24:13,651 --> 00:24:14,736
Luke: Why not World of Warcraft?

420
00:24:15,118 --> 00:24:17,108
Luke: I mean why is that not an RPG?

421
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,133
Luke: I don't know.

422
00:24:18,194 --> 00:24:19,662
Rym: none of that is attached to the character.

423
00:24:19,702 --> 00:24:20,587
Rym: It's all kind of the meta.

424
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:21,210
Jared: It's just there.

425
00:24:21,492 --> 00:24:23,409
Jared: It's just there and you're unlocking bits and pieces of it.

426
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,597
Jared: There's no, but I the more you.

427
00:24:25,678 --> 00:24:25,959
Luke: but you're.

428
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:28,608
Luke: you talk about that pacifist character all the time.

429
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,703
Jared: well That's cuz I'm using it to bring up an exit.

430
00:24:30,783 --> 00:24:31,510
Jared: to make an example.

431
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,652
Jared: I mean no I I. I have memories about the character But it does.

432
00:24:35,712 --> 00:24:37,238
Jared: it never feels like the character has memories.

433
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:38,263
Jared: the characters a cipher.

434
00:24:38,704 --> 00:24:40,030
Jared: the characters a cipher with some numbers.

435
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:43,441
Luke: This is the case I mean for everything you said it before.

436
00:24:43,461 --> 00:24:47,673
Luke: the character doesn't exist in an energy correct, but but The character.

437
00:24:48,535 --> 00:24:50,962
Jared: well the character, I'm getting flustered.

438
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,168
Jared: cuz Luke's pushing a big button of mine.

439
00:24:53,228 --> 00:24:56,594
Luke: Go let's go Come on Come on.

440
00:24:56,615 --> 00:24:57,437
Luke: I'm pushing the big red button.

441
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:58,360
Luke: so the care come on.

442
00:24:58,421 --> 00:25:02,757
Jared: Which is it I think for an RPG?

443
00:25:02,778 --> 00:25:10,483
Jared: the players memory of the events and The characters memory.

444
00:25:10,503 --> 00:25:15,828
Jared: the events are Are Similar, but disparate things.

445
00:25:17,852 --> 00:25:20,250
Jared: The events that happen in the character not the events that happen to the player.

446
00:25:22,273 --> 00:25:23,327
Jared: There's a lot there's a lot.

447
00:25:24,971 --> 00:25:25,171
Jared: There's.

448
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:27,479
Jared: there's emotional resonance in this emotional context.

449
00:25:27,499 --> 00:25:28,161
Jared: It's not there.

450
00:25:28,242 --> 00:25:29,767
Luke: You are twisting yourself around this point.

451
00:25:29,827 --> 00:25:33,850
Luke: I mean yeah Yeah, I agree with you, but so I don't post on forums anymore.

452
00:25:34,091 --> 00:25:38,887
Luke: I agree that I think it that counteracts or contradicts rather your earlier statement.

453
00:25:38,927 --> 00:25:39,750
Luke: the character doesn't exist.

454
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:42,570
Jared: Well I guess I would I said that to be some provocative.

455
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:47,916
Rym: You know the character sheet of World of Warcraft only writes down the kind of these tasks You've accomplished that.

456
00:25:48,037 --> 00:25:55,683
Rym: everyone else who played that same You know class and race basically is also accomplished once they get to that level And doesn't write down all the personal like everything else.

457
00:25:55,723 --> 00:25:57,190
Rym: all the decisions you made there were interesting.

458
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:00,930
Jared: It'd be interesting if it if it took into account like oh my god that know that one.

459
00:26:01,011 --> 00:26:07,350
Jared: No took me so many times To go back and to kill him and eventually he did and I had to kite him and I had to get this weapon.

460
00:26:08,212 --> 00:26:09,177
Rym: Using the lingo.

461
00:26:09,217 --> 00:26:10,202
Jared: you're really good.

462
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:11,448
Jared: I'm a professional, dude.

463
00:26:14,954 --> 00:26:16,108
Rym: But like look at D&D or not?

464
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:27,121
Rym: Do you look at a role-playing game where you have the paper and you and your record like you're writing down like I got this And you're kind of the filter of the stuff you remembered you care about Gets onto the character sheet at least in a role-playing game.

465
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:27,603
Rym: that does that.

466
00:26:27,624 --> 00:26:29,736
Rym: I mean he doesn't do that by default But some games do?

467
00:26:29,937 --> 00:26:37,190
Luke: when you guys play role-playing games Do you make little side notes on the care sheet about things things people said or characters you met or stuff like that?

468
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,383
Scott: Just because I'm really I'm forgetful.

469
00:26:40,423 --> 00:26:45,903
Scott: like even if I'm like GMing I'll try to write everything down and then I'll forget just because I don't.

470
00:26:46,043 --> 00:26:49,268
Luke: what about when you're playing when you're forgetful when you're Playing so you don't write things down.

471
00:26:52,131 --> 00:26:58,730
Rym: Scott basically will say things in role-playing games like I use the proper noun to attack the bad guy.

472
00:26:59,593 --> 00:27:10,041
Scott: Alright, you know even if I'm playing like I'll write down something like in D&D Write write down if there's like we got some crazy item or something or if there's a puzzle I'll try to figure it out, but I don't you know.

473
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:11,147
Scott: I just don't have the instance.

474
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:19,509
Scott: the same problem I'll bring a camera with me everywhere And I'll never take a picture even though I really really mean to Just because I don't have the instinct to actually pull it out and actually use it.

475
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,917
Rym: Don't look at me with the same pity.

476
00:27:20,937 --> 00:27:21,842
Rym: you're looking at Scott with.

477
00:27:21,942 --> 00:27:27,130
Rym: I write down the names every character I run into and like stuff about him and how much I care about him, and I remember it.

478
00:27:28,031 --> 00:27:30,524
Rym: I actually use NPCs first names when I talk to them.

479
00:27:30,645 --> 00:27:31,489
Jared: I'm more like Scott.

480
00:27:32,232 --> 00:27:33,195
Luke: I guess I'm in the middle, but I'll like.

481
00:27:33,316 --> 00:27:35,825
Luke: I'll make a note on the character sheet itself.

482
00:27:35,885 --> 00:27:39,260
Luke: like just like you know We meet somebody like you know Vanya.

483
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,190
Luke: I'll just write down Vanya like I have no context.

484
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:45,525
Luke: I also I also will write down funny things that Scott says or that from Rich will say.

485
00:27:45,545 --> 00:27:50,729
Luke: like I'll write down quotes Often, but my point here is that the character sheet?

486
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:57,803
Luke: Just as you're talking about in World of Warcraft your physical character She definitely becomes an artifact and it becomes almost like a totem.

487
00:27:58,124 --> 00:27:59,630
Luke: like how many how many?

488
00:28:00,272 --> 00:28:04,450
Luke: Times you see character sheet that's got coke stains on it and eraser marks rip through it.

489
00:28:07,832 --> 00:28:10,462
Scott: That's Rym won't even replace a book if the covers come off.

490
00:28:10,502 --> 00:28:14,546
Scott: what I do is all like if my she gets messed up is Like I reprint it and re do it.

491
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:15,834
Scott: I gotta be on.

492
00:28:15,874 --> 00:28:16,799
Scott: it's got to be all clean.

493
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:21,157
Rym: even when I refresh like the character is unreadable I keep the old one is backup.

494
00:28:21,177 --> 00:28:22,241
Scott: Maybe oh, man.

495
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:24,789
Rym: I doodled there when I fell asleep during that combat.

496
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:25,859
Luke: interesting I'm like that.

497
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,709
Luke: I'm very much like that.

498
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:35,506
Jared: I'll reprint a character sheet and then Photoshop it so it has the coke stain back on it So you can just make a watermark that will automatically add a different like randomized coke stains.

499
00:28:35,527 --> 00:28:44,210
Scott: the problem is some are Besides I have their character flash already has like you know coke stains like built in to the character sheet like the PDF.

500
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,293
Scott: on Their website there's a.

501
00:28:45,635 --> 00:28:47,180
Jared: there's a couple books that inspect.

502
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,886
Jared: the German version of inspectors is like that.

503
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:50,030
Scott: There's a German version.

504
00:28:50,472 --> 00:28:51,175
Scott: Yeah, how many?

505
00:28:51,195 --> 00:28:53,647
Scott: how many languages are there for right now?

506
00:28:53,687 --> 00:28:56,156
Jared: There's Two and Polish is in the works.

507
00:28:56,457 --> 00:28:57,220
Scott: Oh wow awesome.

508
00:28:57,441 --> 00:29:00,090
Scott: How about never like they're burning wheels that and any other non-english?

509
00:29:00,951 --> 00:29:02,296
Luke: No, I tried to get a contract.

510
00:29:02,316 --> 00:29:03,399
Luke: I don't understand.

511
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:16,350
Luke: I tried to get a. these guys offered to translate to Spanish and Catalan and yeah To like two more languages, and they were only gonna print 80 copies, and I said right.

512
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,617
Scott: So it's just for you and your friends.

513
00:29:17,637 --> 00:29:19,005
Luke: Yeah, I'm like what the hell they're like.

514
00:29:19,045 --> 00:29:19,950
Luke: the markets very small.

515
00:29:20,271 --> 00:29:24,145
Luke: We'll put like 80 Catalan and 100 Spanish whatever and I'm like 100 Spanish.

516
00:29:24,245 --> 00:29:25,550
Luke: really are you like?

517
00:29:26,093 --> 00:29:27,140
Luke: I don't either.

518
00:29:27,341 --> 00:29:27,703
Luke: I was like.

519
00:29:27,743 --> 00:29:28,770
Luke: I don't think that's enough.

520
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:35,768
Luke: I think you could probably sell a thousand in Spanish and so we couldn't work out the deal And I and they wanted to take three years, and I wanted them to do it in two.

521
00:29:36,411 --> 00:29:40,100
Luke: So I'm pretty much just a bastard who ruins all things that are good.

522
00:29:40,931 --> 00:29:43,330
Scott: Would you would you be opposed to like a fan translation?

523
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:49,593
Luke: fanslation uh Yes I Mean whatever.

524
00:29:49,674 --> 00:29:54,218
Luke: if somebody's gonna translate it at home for their group or whatever that's fine, but once you post Changing hands.

525
00:29:54,238 --> 00:29:55,124
Jared: That's when it's I mean.

526
00:29:55,145 --> 00:29:55,890
Scott: what if it wasn't money?

527
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,780
Scott: It was just you know we put on the Internet's.

528
00:29:58,042 --> 00:30:01,075
Luke: if you post my shit for free on the Internet I will ask you to stop.

529
00:30:01,095 --> 00:30:02,801
Luke: I hate it.

530
00:30:03,704 --> 00:30:04,446
Luke: I really hate it.

531
00:30:04,466 --> 00:30:06,234
Scott: I Guess we don't.

532
00:30:06,254 --> 00:30:07,662
Scott: I guess we don't want to go into that topic.

533
00:30:07,702 --> 00:30:08,768
Scott: we could do a whole show on there, right?

534
00:30:11,073 --> 00:30:14,810
Scott: So so you know you guys I guess you know you're mostly here to talk about making games.

535
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:15,857
Scott: What are there any games?

536
00:30:15,877 --> 00:30:17,850
Scott: You've like played a lot recently or that you're really?

00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:22,790
Scott: no No, I mean like you know like I wanted.

540
00:30:23,011 --> 00:30:24,398
Scott: I don't want you to like just shout out.

541
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:26,428
Scott: Oh these are the games our friends make or the.

542
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:30,354
Jared: you know I'm not gonna do that because I don't Like actual.

543
00:30:30,394 --> 00:30:32,424
Scott: like recent game experiences that were awesome.

544
00:30:32,766 --> 00:30:33,610
Jared: pandemic is awesome.

545
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:37,488
Scott: I make really the the like you know the the everyone versus the game game.

546
00:30:37,528 --> 00:30:41,679
Rym: yeah Yeah, it was pandemic a role-playing game because a lot of people treated as one.

547
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:44,912
Jared: oh I was totally playing it like a role-playing game in fact.

548
00:30:44,953 --> 00:30:48,223
Jared: I was told Jared don't roleplay Don't roleplay.

549
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,407
Jared: I was playing the crazy guy.

550
00:30:49,427 --> 00:30:49,789
Jared: Who's like.

551
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,615
Jared: I'm gonna solve the world's problems.

552
00:30:51,655 --> 00:30:52,880
Jared: I'm gonna cure this disease.

553
00:30:53,001 --> 00:30:54,433
Jared: But it's an emergent process crazy.

554
00:30:54,494 --> 00:30:55,220
Jared: It's totally emergent.

555
00:30:55,361 --> 00:30:56,045
Jared: It's not like.

556
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:57,333
Luke: there's not a.

557
00:30:57,554 --> 00:30:58,058
Jared: you don't need to do it.

558
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,788
Luke: You can talk back to you if you start talking to it.

559
00:31:00,848 --> 00:31:07,399
Luke: essentially right the game does not and further encourage you to make Moral ethical decisions in the framework of the character the game.

560
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,619
Scott: I think the game pretty much has a pretty straight moral of save the world.

561
00:31:11,081 --> 00:31:14,652
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't say don't save the world or decide.

562
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:17,320
Jared: there's no size for being the guy who discovers the last cure.

563
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,626
Jared: There's no prize.

564
00:31:18,686 --> 00:31:18,987
Luke: There's no.

565
00:31:19,228 --> 00:31:22,000
Luke: there's no prize for making a heartfelt decision.

566
00:31:22,482 --> 00:31:24,529
Luke: Do I save my wife or do I save the whole world?

567
00:31:24,891 --> 00:31:26,778
Luke: right like like you never make that decision.

568
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:27,420
Luke: and where were you brought?

569
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:27,661
Jared: Up?

570
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:28,444
Jared: yeah, Atlanta.

571
00:31:28,484 --> 00:31:30,553
Jared: Well guess what it's just been overrun.

572
00:31:30,573 --> 00:31:31,919
Luke: Yeah, how do you feel about that?

573
00:31:33,603 --> 00:31:42,474
Rym: But I mean you like Value in these emerging experiences where the game was not intended as a role-playing game and yet those same Maybe this is why D&D is still so popular.

574
00:31:42,494 --> 00:31:49,330
Rym: D&D You know the game doesn't really intend kind of their kinds of role-playing we do and yet it comes out anyway Just because that's what people innately want.

575
00:31:49,431 --> 00:31:50,014
Rym: what will they do?

576
00:31:50,054 --> 00:31:51,000
Rym: the same thing to pandemic?

577
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:56,196
Jared: What we call role-playing which is talking in funny voices and making weird decisions based on what this is.

578
00:31:56,236 --> 00:32:00,428
Jared: what my character would do is Totally an emergent property from D&D.

579
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:02,152
Jared: It's not anything.

580
00:32:02,273 --> 00:32:03,997
Luke: I right D&D doesn't tell you to do that.

581
00:32:04,198 --> 00:32:04,920
Jared: It's not the act.

582
00:32:05,222 --> 00:32:07,180
Jared: Yeah, D&D is not a theatrical experience.

583
00:32:07,281 --> 00:32:12,101
Jared: I think if it was written like that Dave and Gary's friends would be like I'm not gonna do that I'm not.

584
00:32:12,162 --> 00:32:12,845
Jared: what do you want us to do?

585
00:32:12,905 --> 00:32:14,935
Jared: dress up in robes - but that's the other thing.

586
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:18,186
Luke: you don't say it Except it emerges natural happens.

587
00:32:18,928 --> 00:32:19,269
Luke: It's just.

588
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:23,020
Luke: it's kind of how we embody media.

589
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:27,640
Luke: We like how we come out of a movie theater and we're talking about the characters like they're real.

590
00:32:28,102 --> 00:32:29,046
Luke: Right the movie that we just saw.

591
00:32:29,066 --> 00:32:32,340
Luke: we quote lines incessantly like we talk about a character as if the character did something.

592
00:32:32,462 --> 00:32:33,538
Luke: No, nobody did anything.

593
00:32:33,981 --> 00:32:35,668
Luke: Leonardo DiCaprio didn't do anything either.

594
00:32:35,728 --> 00:32:36,832
Luke: He was told to do something.

595
00:32:36,852 --> 00:32:41,164
Luke: He was instructed and he followed a very Strict formula.

596
00:32:41,204 --> 00:32:43,532
Jared: He didn't really do anything period he just talked a lot.

597
00:32:44,274 --> 00:32:45,880
Jared: He just told you what he was gonna do.

598
00:32:47,843 --> 00:32:48,726
Scott: We saw it yesterday.

599
00:32:48,746 --> 00:32:52,059
Scott: I noticed some similarities with like lacuna in there.

600
00:32:53,161 --> 00:32:54,932
Luke: It's really it's really scary.

601
00:32:54,952 --> 00:32:55,153
Jared: Yeah.

602
00:32:55,214 --> 00:32:58,490
Jared: Yeah Luke made you made the list right of.

603
00:32:58,691 --> 00:33:07,106
Luke: yeah, there's a list like it's static levels Hostile personalities personalities Diving slut the slab.

604
00:33:07,306 --> 00:33:11,680
Luke: Jared already wrote the Inception role-playing game, which is really eerie for those of you at home.

605
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:23,061
Luke: 2006 yeah, so apparently he went into Christopher Nolan's dream state and did an Inception Traction.

606
00:33:23,242 --> 00:33:24,707
Scott: Marvy Christopher Nolan's played lacuna.

607
00:33:24,727 --> 00:33:26,432
Jared: We don't know he could have possible.

608
00:33:26,453 --> 00:33:28,720
Jared: There's I know a bunch of screenwriters who have played my game.

609
00:33:33,481 --> 00:33:42,240
Scott: Yeah, I mean it was But I thought that it was you know Just incredibly like welcome that they would had something so complex and off the wall.

610
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:42,844
Scott: They usually went.

611
00:33:42,904 --> 00:33:45,460
Scott: other movies and TV shows try to do the same thing.

612
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,759
Scott: It's like, you know, they go into the realm of even comprehensibility, but you don't know what's going on.

613
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:57,788
Jared: It wasn't complex or off the wall pretty straightforward If you compare it to like standard fare.

614
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,475
Jared: you want to see something complex and off the wall.

615
00:33:59,635 --> 00:34:00,940
Jared: see Rafifi what's your?

Jared: Just go see it.

617
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:04,055
Jared: Oh, it's just go see it.

618
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:04,980
Jared: Oh, yeah, it's a movie.

619
00:34:06,241 --> 00:34:07,547
Scott: Is it on DVD?

620
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,636
Scott: What country is it from DVDs on Netflix?

621
00:34:09,656 --> 00:34:10,299
Scott: What year is it from?

622
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:14,190
Luke: 1957 no 60 no, no, no, no early much earlier.

623
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,414
Luke: It's like 49 or something.

624
00:34:15,434 --> 00:34:17,060
Jared: Oh tub copy is the one that came after.

625
00:34:17,141 --> 00:34:17,406
Jared: That's what.

626
00:34:17,427 --> 00:34:18,060
Jared: that's what I'm thinking.

627
00:34:18,201 --> 00:34:19,786
Luke: But but copy so that's the see.

628
00:34:19,888 --> 00:34:20,389
Jared: either one of those.

629
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:22,699
Jared: actually see them back to back and your mind will be blown.

630
00:34:23,183 --> 00:34:24,210
Rym: We'll have to trade them some.

631
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:27,264
Luke: ma chareau They're heist films.

632
00:34:27,304 --> 00:34:27,786
Luke: They're they're.

633
00:34:27,827 --> 00:34:31,703
Luke: they're really actually pretty grounded high school Right.

634
00:34:31,744 --> 00:34:33,030
Luke: Yeah, exactly.

635
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:36,185
Jared: And that's why we're suggesting these and The.

636
00:34:36,266 --> 00:34:40,636
Luke: the heist in Rafifi is has no Music, no dialogue.

637
00:34:40,676 --> 00:34:44,248
Jared: No music And it goes 20 minutes long 20 minutes long.

638
00:34:44,289 --> 00:34:45,754
Jared: It will blow your mind.

639
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:47,460
Jared: You will be biting your friends.

640
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,103
Luke: Dude I could.

641
00:34:51,165 --> 00:34:55,760
Luke: I have never been able to conceive of how to get you fucking monkeys to behave like that.

642
00:34:56,021 --> 00:34:57,369
Luke: That's one of the reasons I won't write a noir.

643
00:34:57,389 --> 00:35:01,448
Luke: role-playing game is because in noir You have to behave in a certain way.

644
00:35:01,729 --> 00:35:03,315
Luke: You cannot goof off.

645
00:35:03,576 --> 00:35:11,219
Luke: You can't eat Cheetos You can't crack jokes that are outside of like, you know, the weird noir like underworld code like like.

646
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:15,034
Jared: There would have to be people behind you with guns in order for a role-playing game.

647
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:16,179
Jared: New aren't role-playing him to work.

648
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:19,272
Rym: So the box comes with a couple of zip guns.

649
00:35:19,372 --> 00:35:21,260
Jared: It comes with a couple large men with zip guns.

650
00:35:21,441 --> 00:35:24,439
Jared: It's like hey, I don't think you want to be making no money Python jokes.

651
00:35:25,087 --> 00:35:26,059
Luke: It's not a mafia role-playing.

652
00:35:26,181 --> 00:35:33,715
Luke: I love noir Holy passion and it just I've never been able to conceive of the tone.

653
00:35:33,775 --> 00:35:36,364
Luke: and if you look at all the modern Role-playing games boat noir.

654
00:35:36,404 --> 00:35:39,972
Luke: They all incorporate some gonzo element that just destroys it.

655
00:35:40,273 --> 00:35:41,857
Jared: Just here's noir with fairies.

656
00:35:41,937 --> 00:35:44,205
Jared: Here's noir with Cat.

657
00:35:44,246 --> 00:35:45,478
Scott: people are with spider-man.

658
00:35:48,124 --> 00:35:49,760
Rym: So to bring it back hey, wait a minute.

659
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:56,760
Rym: It's just like this natural emergent behavior that we do just when we play games like emergently we will play.

660
00:35:56,802 --> 00:36:01,833
Rym: Yeah What's the purpose of a role-playing game as opposed to just role-playing to reward that?

661
00:36:01,913 --> 00:36:04,885
Jared: if you reward that you've made a role-playing game Oh my god.

662
00:36:04,905 --> 00:36:05,409
Jared: I just answered.

663
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:06,317
Jared: What is a role-playing game?

664
00:36:08,141 --> 00:36:10,458
Luke: Yeah, I mean it's different.

665
00:36:10,498 --> 00:36:19,040
Luke: when you know, I'm playing memoir 44 and I'm talking to funny German accent and I'm you know, I'm You know driving toward my evil axis goals.

666
00:36:19,764 --> 00:36:19,925
Luke: it's.

667
00:36:20,146 --> 00:36:47,593
Luke: it's just very different than when I play a World war two role-playing game and I'm playing a German commander who's doing awful things and just that like it's just well Here's the quality of the experience is just very very different when right when it's something that I'm just kind of goofing off doing versus when I am suddenly kind of in the Boiling pot having to make these horrible decisions and say and thinking well, but I don't like not I don't want to make this decision.

668
00:36:47,613 --> 00:36:48,540
Luke: I don't want to be this guy.

669
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,229
Jared: So you just said, you know evil decisions in the memoir game.

670
00:36:51,671 --> 00:36:52,915
Jared: There are no evil decisions.

671
00:36:52,976 --> 00:36:55,442
Jared: There's no evil axis Plans.

672
00:36:55,623 --> 00:36:59,298
Jared: in memoir 44 there's pieces on a board and you're trying to eliminate the other pieces.

673
00:36:59,338 --> 00:37:01,183
Jared: There's no There's no good.

674
00:37:01,203 --> 00:37:01,785
Jared: There's no evil.

675
00:37:01,805 --> 00:37:11,072
Jared: There's just side a and side B. as soon as you start ascribing motivation and philosophical Ideologies and intent and good and evil and emotion.

676
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:13,100
Jared: That's when it becomes a role-playing game, right?

677
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,345
Luke: I never weigh like.

678
00:37:14,606 --> 00:37:18,080
Luke: I'll play the the the axis in memoir without really thinking about it.

679
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,979
Luke: I mean, I you know, I grimace a little bit.

680
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,431
Jared: There's a historical context you're aware of but it's not.

681
00:37:22,472 --> 00:37:24,220
Jared: it doesn't really factor into the game, right?

682
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,685
Scott: But I'm you're not gonna pick.

683
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:30,542
Scott: you're not gonna pick the axis in axis and allies and just say yeah We're not attacking.

684
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,505
Scott: I'm just not I'm just sitting still.

685
00:37:32,705 --> 00:37:45,179
Luke: Yeah Please take the concentration camps.

686
00:37:48,023 --> 00:37:50,171
Scott: Yeah, you just it's backed like his new infantry.

687
00:37:50,191 --> 00:37:50,854
Scott: it's made of Jews.

688
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:51,456
Scott: they rose up.

689
00:37:51,778 --> 00:37:52,139
Scott: there we go.

690
00:37:53,182 --> 00:37:53,905
Luke: It's just different.

691
00:37:53,946 --> 00:38:10,941
Luke: It's it's a different quality of experience because the game is Opening up this other space now saying hey think about this from this perspective make decisions from this perspective When but also that the quality of the mechanics are very very different from a role-playing game to a Boardgame.

692
00:38:10,981 --> 00:38:19,309
Luke: and as Jared talked about it like you're right you're manipulating pieces and resources and and betting on randomization Gambling essentially in a board game.

693
00:38:19,913 --> 00:38:24,959
Luke: when Jared and I made free market We went through a lot of iterations of the the card mechanics in the game.

694
00:38:25,421 --> 00:38:26,548
Luke: Yeah, card based role-playing game.

695
00:38:26,789 --> 00:38:35,722
Luke: and at one point Jared was like yeah, I don't know Can we tighten this down you know because it's a little it was a little loosey-goosey at that point and We did we.

696
00:38:35,943 --> 00:38:46,666
Luke: we spent a weekend and we really ratcheted down the card based mechanics to where it was this very intense Card game and had a crazy like it had a weird Mechanic where you didn't see.

697
00:38:46,766 --> 00:38:49,035
Jared: some people could see your cards and then some cards were hidden.

698
00:38:49,095 --> 00:38:49,577
Jared: and right.

699
00:38:49,657 --> 00:38:50,280
Jared: is that what you're yeah?

700
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,526
Jared: Yeah, it was really like.

701
00:38:51,606 --> 00:38:52,933
Jared: it was a crazy cool like.

702
00:38:53,094 --> 00:39:00,120
Jared: it was totally like memoir Inspired actually because you had certain resources that you were privy to that your opponents weren't in certain.

703
00:39:00,261 --> 00:39:01,850
Jared: Oh, yeah, resources that they knew about.

704
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:02,514
Jared: that you didn't.

705
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:03,440
Jared: it was really weird.

706
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,459
Luke: Yeah, you had to show your opponent's cards that you couldn't see and stuff like that.

707
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,200
Luke: What happened there is it became a card game.

708
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:12,505
Luke: It was a cool card game But it stopped being a role-playing game.

709
00:39:12,826 --> 00:39:24,103
Luke: it became like the decision-making for the card and tactical element became so intense That we stopped talking in funny voices and making important Ethical decisions.

710
00:39:24,344 --> 00:39:24,745
Luke: in the game.

711
00:39:24,906 --> 00:39:30,341
Jared: it was the equivalent of that that tower defense game where you only build that one tower because it supersedes everything Else.

712
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,124
Jared: it's the same idea.

713
00:39:31,164 --> 00:39:31,546
Jared: It's it's.

714
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:35,080
Jared: why would I roleplay when none of that matters?

715
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:39,580
Jared: All that matters is I you know get four points more than my opponent and that's what I'm concentrating on.

716
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:46,720
Jared: That's what I'm putting all my effort and energy into right and the role-playing game game Just kind of falls apart, and you just don't think about it because it doesn't really matter.

717
00:39:47,032 --> 00:39:51,413
Luke: I mean I'm actually really bad at RTS games like Starcraft whatever because I try to make a story out of them.

718
00:39:51,494 --> 00:39:53,543
Luke: as I play I try to have kind of a Complete narrative.

719
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:56,799
Luke: I like you know I like there to be a beginning middle and end to the whole game.

720
00:39:57,641 --> 00:40:01,119
Luke: And I'm so poor for I I'm that's it's too much for me.

721
00:40:02,242 --> 00:40:02,866
Luke: I'm also.

722
00:40:02,886 --> 00:40:04,274
Luke: I love the idea of dwarf fortress.

723
00:40:04,294 --> 00:40:05,240
Luke: I'm just not capable.

724
00:40:08,064 --> 00:40:09,218
Jared: Loose mind hasn't cracked.

725
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:15,380
Luke: but also in memoir and Commanding colors I played recently the basis of memoir.

726
00:40:15,461 --> 00:40:22,579
Luke: I have I have the same instinct But I've actually gotten good at playing memoir because I can understand the the the games a little bit.

727
00:40:23,223 --> 00:40:24,031
Luke: You know it's easier.

728
00:40:24,051 --> 00:40:35,720
Luke: There's basically less less complexity than like Starcraft or an RTS whatever, but so in memoir like I Can play for points even though I want my army to win even though I want this unit to survive.

729
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:38,079
Luke: You know I want to keep my battle lines neat.

730
00:40:38,481 --> 00:40:39,124
Luke: You know I want to.

731
00:40:39,185 --> 00:40:46,876
Luke: I want to run my tanks behind you and be like true I want all these things to happen, but I know the way to win is to score points right.

732
00:40:46,996 --> 00:40:56,247
Luke: and so I've You know learned through Ten or twenty years of hard lessons that I should just win the game And stop goofing off.

733
00:40:56,267 --> 00:40:57,936
Luke: I played risk a couple years ago.

734
00:40:57,977 --> 00:40:58,580
Luke: We were in Boston.

735
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,587
Luke: It was one of my very best friends in the whole world.

736
00:41:01,049 --> 00:41:01,791
Luke: He loves risk.

737
00:41:01,832 --> 00:41:04,019
Luke: He absolutely loves it, and he was winning.

738
00:41:05,301 --> 00:41:06,608
Luke: And he was having a good time winning.

739
00:41:07,251 --> 00:41:07,472
Luke: and he.

740
00:41:07,573 --> 00:41:08,980
Scott: everyone else was not having a good day.

741
00:41:09,161 --> 00:41:11,314
Luke: Everybody else was out and watching right nobody else having a good time.

742
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:12,485
Luke: I was still in the game I think.

743
00:41:12,506 --> 00:41:13,320
Luke: hold up in Australia.

744
00:41:13,602 --> 00:41:16,885
Luke: I was holed up in Australia, and I think my friend was holed up even like it If you can be.

745
00:41:16,926 --> 00:41:28,733
Luke: but he was a holed up in in South America - you can do that yeah, so and you know my friend was just like you know cashing in the cards And he was just like dumping units all over the board.

746
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:30,258
Luke: and we're like what the hell you doing man.

747
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:32,540
Jared: He could win immediately.

748
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,410
Luke: He had us walled in.

749
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,641
Luke: we couldn't go anywhere And he's just.

750
00:41:34,702 --> 00:41:40,590
Luke: he's just playing and like picking at us or whatever and getting cards get my armies into the triple digits Right and just like.

751
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:43,791
Luke: and we're like dude We gotta get mad at him.

752
00:41:43,811 --> 00:41:44,839
Luke: We're like what the hell he's like.

753
00:41:45,382 --> 00:41:47,933
Luke: We're like just attack because we can't get out or anything.

754
00:41:47,953 --> 00:41:56,520
Luke: He's just like no no no He just would not win and in the game nothing in the game and forced him like to take the winning move like nothing like.

755
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,086
Luke: There was no balancing mechanic.

756
00:41:58,127 --> 00:41:59,010
Luke: No nothing going on.

757
00:41:59,030 --> 00:41:59,492
Luke: There's no.

758
00:41:59,572 --> 00:42:01,299
Jared: once you have this many troops on the board you win.

759
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,360
Luke: Yeah, yeah, no endgame mechanic nothing.

760
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:07,393
Luke: It would just pure hate and frustration talk about that a lot.

761
00:42:07,433 --> 00:42:09,400
Scott: the games are that are over when they're not over.

762
00:42:09,521 --> 00:42:11,876
Scott: Yeah, it's like we played Chicago Express.

763
00:42:11,916 --> 00:42:12,500
Scott: We just did a show.

764
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:15,791
Rym: I was mathematically eliminated from victory two turns in right.

765
00:42:15,811 --> 00:42:19,347
Scott: this is a train game called age of steam and the way age of steam Works is every turn.

766
00:42:19,387 --> 00:42:20,414
Scott: it beats the crap out of you.

767
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:21,200
Scott: It takes all your money.

768
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:24,954
Scott: So if you're not doing well enough to win like you're after like three turns.

769
00:42:24,974 --> 00:42:25,516
Scott: It's like you're out.

770
00:42:25,537 --> 00:42:26,984
Scott: leave you're done You can't.

771
00:42:27,004 --> 00:42:29,400
Jared: you're not even in it and the game tells you to leave right here.

772
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:35,260
Scott: You just stop playing and the game tells you to stop playing, but Chicago Express leave implicitly when someone flips the board over.

773
00:42:36,861 --> 00:42:39,067
Scott: But you know the the Chicago Express.

774
00:42:39,127 --> 00:42:41,213
Scott: we were mathematically eliminated from victory.

775
00:42:41,474 --> 00:42:45,992
Scott: the only thing we could have done to maybe you know The only thing that matters in the end is how much money you have.

776
00:42:46,113 --> 00:42:53,119
Scott: right and the only way to get more money is to More shares, but if anyone bought a share that would have ended the game And we already had a guy who was way ahead so he would have won.

777
00:42:53,943 --> 00:42:57,420
Scott: But if we don't buy a share he would have continued to get more money.

778
00:42:57,901 --> 00:42:59,888
Scott: So it's like and a share costs money.

779
00:42:59,929 --> 00:43:03,140
Rym: so someone's got to take one for the team and end the game and guarantee loss.

780
00:43:03,674 --> 00:43:08,453
Scott: Yeah so otherwise you just keep playing and there's a lot of games role-playing and otherwise.

781
00:43:08,493 --> 00:43:14,254
Scott: where there is there's a victory condition and that Victory condition is somehow set like we already know who's gonna win.

782
00:43:14,535 --> 00:43:15,780
Scott: right there is no changing that.

783
00:43:16,181 --> 00:43:24,448
Scott: But that victory condition actually reaching it is some way in the future and at the present time we already know you know Our destiny.

784
00:43:24,549 --> 00:43:28,400
Scott: it is it is locked in stone But the game isn't over because the victory condition is poor.

785
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,946
Rym: Is that a problem in a role-playing game?

786
00:43:29,966 --> 00:43:35,066
Rym: because you can play out the scenario and try to make decisions as to like how the bad Ending or good anything is gonna roll out.

787
00:43:35,086 --> 00:43:35,609
Jared: well there there are.

788
00:43:35,629 --> 00:43:40,861
Jared: I mean there are games that that start off the bat saying You're gonna die Mmm.

789
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:43,719
Jared: It doesn't matter your life's a joke.

790
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:46,809
Jared: Now what I mean right off the bat?

791
00:43:46,829 --> 00:43:49,499
Jared: character creation, how are you gonna die what's gonna happen to you and

792
00:43:51,904 --> 00:43:53,898
Rym: How your character will die on the sheet at creation,

793
00:43:53,958 --> 00:43:56,265
Scott: but 2001

794
00:43:56,265 --> 00:43:57,051
Jared: schism yes

795
00:43:57,272 --> 00:44:04,421
Scott: to say it a different way I guess it's that there might be a game that has meaningful decisions and at a certain point before the game is over you are You're.

796
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:06,932
Scott: there are no more meaningful decisions that can be made.

797
00:44:07,273 --> 00:44:10,160
Jared: You know you can role-playing game though There's always a meaningful decision.

798
00:44:10,321 --> 00:44:10,923
Luke: That's not true.

799
00:44:10,983 --> 00:44:11,625
Luke: necessarily like it.

800
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:16,284
Luke: burning wheel has a problem where it like a fight can reach a point where they're very Like.

801
00:44:16,304 --> 00:44:19,057
Luke: there's really no meaningful decisions like and I'm not saying a fight.

802
00:44:19,097 --> 00:44:19,620
Jared: I'm saying a game.

803
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:23,046
Jared: I'm saying an actual game, but it's In the.

804
00:44:23,207 --> 00:44:25,618
Luke: in the process of this mechanic you reach the point where you just need to end the fight.

805
00:44:25,859 --> 00:44:28,197
Luke: true And make sure and the instructions running wheel are lacking.

806
00:44:28,217 --> 00:44:38,556
Luke: in this case We fix that in the new book, but the where they're like the game doesn't come out and say hey Hey dumbass just stop and move on like right Which?

807
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,235
Luke: Because I made an assumption that it's a role-playing game.

808
00:44:41,255 --> 00:44:41,860
Luke: You'll figure this out.

809
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,780
Luke: That's what you do you you you are talking to each other as players, and you know okay?

810
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:50,948
Luke: Well this we're done with this we move on but the actual procedural instructions Don't tell you that's that I mean in free market.

811
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:55,264
Jared: We have a specific action which is and the challenge Right that's it's.

812
00:44:55,364 --> 00:44:58,559
Luke: I think it's to solve some of that, but it's really interesting though because the end the challenge can some.

813
00:45:00,962 --> 00:45:02,519
Luke: It's kind it's it's almost broken.

814
00:45:03,883 --> 00:45:09,194
Luke: the end the challenge mechanic because It can be a foregone conclusion who's gonna win who's gonna lose?

815
00:45:09,516 --> 00:45:12,407
Luke: I can force the decision onto your shoulders.

816
00:45:12,447 --> 00:45:18,128
Luke: if you're losing I can say here go ahead you can take an action a futile action or You can end the challenge.

817
00:45:18,531 --> 00:45:19,376
Scott: you know what I just realized.

818
00:45:19,396 --> 00:45:21,204
Scott: you're explaining His way.

819
00:45:21,264 --> 00:45:23,753
Scott: this might seem like it's out of nowhere, but this is gonna make sense.

820
00:45:23,773 --> 00:45:25,640
Scott: you're explaining the rules of roller derby to me.

821
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:32,430
Scott: The last time we were at ConnectiCon eating right and you told me that the per the first jammer that passes through gets to Choose when it's over mm-hmm.

822
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:32,713
Scott: all right.

823
00:45:32,733 --> 00:45:33,519
Scott: It's like the same thing.

824
00:45:33,681 --> 00:45:34,806
Scott: It's like you know you're.

825
00:45:34,846 --> 00:45:35,731
Scott: you're in this position.

826
00:45:35,791 --> 00:45:37,540
Scott: You can choose to end it at any time.

827
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:38,183
Jared: Yeah, I mean the.

828
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:42,180
Jared: the jam will end at two minutes regardless, but they can end it early right.

829
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,288
Luke: That's a huge tactical decision right.

830
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:44,811
Luke: There's a double.

831
00:45:44,871 --> 00:45:45,493
Luke: It's double jeopardy.

832
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:50,575
Luke: right you have two minutes or Up until this certain condition and free market it you know.

833
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:57,439
Luke: so you can choose not to end it And if you don't well, then I get the choice I can continue on you know and choose to end it or push.

834
00:45:57,881 --> 00:45:58,829
Luke: Yeah, I don't know.

835
00:45:59,152 --> 00:46:01,688
Luke: It's it's it's interesting It's a whole other discussion.

836
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:04,020
Luke: you know that you guys talk about it in your panels.

837
00:46:05,201 --> 00:46:10,529
Rym: But right and conditions essentially for a game win conditions Actually because you brought it up and burning will we have?

838
00:46:10,569 --> 00:46:13,020
Rym: actually this very distinct problem has occurred in every game.

839
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,840
Rym: We played today with duels of wits always ending in a tie to the point that it gets frustrated.

840
00:46:19,141 --> 00:46:20,909
Rym: Really, they always end in a time.

841
00:46:20,929 --> 00:46:22,777
Luke: I think it's my guy just going point point point point.

842
00:46:22,817 --> 00:46:26,980
Scott: no What happens a lot is people don't have very powerful?

843
00:46:27,301 --> 00:46:33,300
Scott: Dueling skills often, so what will happen is they'll they'll chisel down and maybe defend a little bit.

844
00:46:35,061 --> 00:46:39,400
Scott: It's down to the wire, and then they'll always go over on the same action.

845
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:43,640
Scott: We could I mean if we looked at negatives like maybe one person would be negative three and one would be negative one.

846
00:46:44,021 --> 00:46:45,266
Luke: There's a reason why that doesn't count.

847
00:46:45,347 --> 00:46:46,170
Luke: it's still a tie.

848
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,760
Luke: so why isn't somebody just rebutting then at that point and winning?

849
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:52,971
Luke: How are like you guys?

850
00:46:52,992 --> 00:46:56,679
Scott: just like showing you Don't have people don't have a lot of.

851
00:46:57,362 --> 00:47:04,509
Rym: There is a hive mind and we know each other well and also The first time we ever played burning wheels the three of us And we you show us how to combat work.

852
00:47:04,791 --> 00:47:05,636
Rym: and there are duel of wits.

853
00:47:05,797 --> 00:47:08,004
Rym: first round Second round we all point.

854
00:47:08,024 --> 00:47:08,465
Rym: third round.

855
00:47:08,505 --> 00:47:08,946
Rym: We all okay.

856
00:47:08,966 --> 00:47:10,691
Jared: Let's see some rock-paper-scissors right now ready.

857
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:15,624
Jared: one two three oh Scott once that's right.

858
00:47:15,644 --> 00:47:15,925
Scott: I won.

859
00:47:15,945 --> 00:47:19,940
Scott: I don't know I Rym didn't do the fistful of dollars because you expect me to do the fistful.

860
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,491
Luke: So how do you do the fistful of dollars?

861
00:47:21,632 --> 00:47:22,740
Scott: rock rock paper?

862
00:47:22,901 --> 00:47:23,463
Scott: Oh, no is it rock?

863
00:47:23,483 --> 00:47:26,960
Scott: two papers or two rocks, and then a paper full of dollars.

864
00:47:27,127 --> 00:47:35,357
Scott: Yeah All right, so you do you do rock and then you on the second round the second go you do rock again And then in the third go you do paper, but you only did one go.

865
00:47:35,377 --> 00:47:40,416
Scott: well Yeah, but we did three goes it would have been two rocks and then a paper.

866
00:47:40,456 --> 00:47:44,524
Jared: I see so it's kind of a Emerging predetermined.

867
00:47:44,845 --> 00:47:45,528
Scott: you know that was

868
00:47:45,628 --> 00:47:48,338
Rym: a media virus that was like infected into the group by Luke

869
00:47:49,542 --> 00:47:50,124
Scott: Different Luke

Scott: I mean you know all right here.

896
00:48:57,522 --> 00:49:06,400
Scott: I'll say this we were at recess to reset the big double recess and someone actually brought eBay the game And it was like this electronic game with cards, and I was surprised.

897
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,151
Scott: It was actually a good game like you know.

898
00:49:09,191 --> 00:49:12,564
Scott: so if you made if you were to make YouTube the game Which you're not commenting on.

899
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:16,340
Scott: you could make it, and it's actually possible for that to be an awesome game.

900
00:49:16,581 --> 00:49:17,646
Jared: It is very possible.

901
00:49:17,847 --> 00:49:18,993
Jared: It is extremely possible.

902
00:49:19,114 --> 00:49:20,340
Luke: You can really make a game out of anything.

903
00:49:20,462 --> 00:49:21,639
Jared: You can make a game out of anything.

904
00:49:22,782 --> 00:49:24,915
Jared: We had guys that have one of our seminars do a tattoo game.

905
00:49:24,935 --> 00:49:28,069
Jared: Oh Being at a tattoo shop.

906
00:49:28,652 --> 00:49:30,600
Rym: I thought it was a game where you have to collect tattoos.

907
00:49:31,581 --> 00:49:33,486
Luke: It could be that but they chose.

908
00:49:33,586 --> 00:49:37,597
Luke: they ultimately chose you had to draw tattoos and put them on people.

909
00:49:37,918 --> 00:49:41,348
Luke: yeah Tattoo artists keep a portfolio of tattoos or something.

910
00:49:41,448 --> 00:49:42,090
Luke: I don't know.

911
00:49:42,231 --> 00:49:46,470
Luke: the game is called like slut mark or something tramp stamp tramp stamp Slut mark.

912
00:49:46,631 --> 00:49:47,278
Jared: that's my game.

913
00:49:49,421 --> 00:49:51,306
Scott: That's the 4chan remix.

914
00:49:51,467 --> 00:49:52,329
Rym: that's Jersey Shore.

915
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:55,619
Jared: the game punch Snooki in the head the RPG.

916
00:49:57,323 --> 00:49:58,535
Jared: It's got trust mechanics.

917
00:49:58,878 --> 00:50:05,915
Rym: so Obviously we all dogs in the vineyard hack what we like about role-playing games and we try to get people to play these games.

918
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:08,997
Rym: and a Lot of people just only know about D&D and just play D&D.

919
00:50:09,621 --> 00:50:15,220
Rym: How do you trick someone into playing a different game other than going to one of our panels?

920
00:50:16,701 --> 00:50:19,979
Rym: Are you like grabbing them at a convention and tricking them into playing with you?

921
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:21,142
Luke: Well people are.

922
00:50:22,025 --> 00:50:22,326
Luke: I found it.

923
00:50:22,366 --> 00:50:23,650
Luke: conventions are usually pretty open-minded.

924
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:25,095
Luke: They'll like they'll definitely do.

925
00:50:25,115 --> 00:50:27,345
Luke: they sit down and yeah I'll give this a try.

926
00:50:27,465 --> 00:50:30,358
Jared: yeah, even the people who really don't want to play will still say yes It's alright.

927
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:34,880
Scott: So so I think more a more direct question that would be more helpful is a lot of people out there.

928
00:50:35,522 --> 00:50:42,892
Scott: They've got a group of gamers already and maybe they hear us and they they're excited about whatever game And they want to switch their people over to.

929
00:50:42,913 --> 00:50:43,537
Scott: this should right.

930
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:51,050
Scott: But they can't convince their part their group of people who have been playing D&D or playing something else To play something else instead.

931
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:52,559
Scott: They can't even convince them to try it.

932
00:50:53,181 --> 00:50:56,010
Luke: There's a I mean, there's kind of two sides to this and there's.

933
00:50:56,151 --> 00:50:58,538
Luke: there's a lot of bad behavior that goes on.

934
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,213
Luke: one You can't like you can't burn the books.

935
00:51:01,254 --> 00:51:04,710
Luke: You can't throw a tantrum You can't you know move and that you know.

936
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:13,754
Luke: and the other players they can't just sit there and be like nope No, no, you know, you got to kind of ask politely and say hey, you know this week I'd like to try this one thing and you have to make it as

937
00:51:13,936 --> 00:51:14,319
Jared: low

938
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,910
Luke: commitment as Possible this one week for two hours.

939
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:21,820
Luke: We're gonna play this other game and you guys are gonna actually give it an honest try.

940
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:23,483
Luke: Okay, really?

941
00:51:23,644 --> 00:51:24,166
Luke: Okay, please.

942
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:26,134
Luke: I'll bring chocolate like right like bribe chocolate.

943
00:51:28,605 --> 00:51:29,271
Luke: Yeah, I didn't.

944
00:51:30,341 --> 00:51:31,003
Luke: So donuts.

945
00:51:31,184 --> 00:51:42,565
Jared: so the problem the problem with the one of the problems with role-playing games is there's this Right off the bat huge like the idea in your brain when you hear role-playing game is at least the classic model is Role-playing game.

946
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:44,377
Jared: we're going to be playing this for seven years.

947
00:51:44,558 --> 00:51:46,332
Jared: everybody Grab a lunch.

948
00:51:46,393 --> 00:51:46,819
Luke: Hell, yeah.

949
00:51:47,822 --> 00:51:55,780
Jared: And when you really need to do is just make some characters throw them down and say, okay We're gonna do one thing We're gonna do one cool thing in this game that this game does well.

950
00:51:56,681 --> 00:51:58,027
Jared: That's what I'm needs to show you the game.

951
00:51:58,047 --> 00:52:00,780
Jared: I mean when Luke does his demos.

952
00:52:00,941 --> 00:52:04,615
Jared: He's not running a five-year burning wheel epic campaign for these people.

953
00:52:04,675 --> 00:52:05,538
Jared: He's doing sadly.

954
00:52:05,598 --> 00:52:08,387
Jared: No a Scenario, which is essentially.

955
00:52:08,608 --> 00:52:09,854
Jared: it's usually a situation.

956
00:52:10,256 --> 00:52:11,080
Jared: There's something going on.

957
00:52:12,366 --> 00:52:12,899
Luke: There's something wrong.

958
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,146
Scott: Inception, right?

959
00:52:15,186 --> 00:52:15,629
Scott: What did they say?

960
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:17,080
Scott: It's like five times, right?

961
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:20,940
Scott: We go like two levels down and run like six campaigns and come back except be like a minute.

962
00:52:21,061 --> 00:52:22,813
Luke: That would be amazing except that doesn't actually happen.

963
00:52:22,894 --> 00:52:26,428
Jared: I know it sucks Mm-hmm That's why you have the sword.

964
00:52:26,448 --> 00:52:27,475
Jared: You have felons rift.

965
00:52:27,636 --> 00:52:29,264
Jared: It's like okay Here's the situation.

966
00:52:29,586 --> 00:52:32,278
Jared: go and you play it and you're done, and it's satisfying.

967
00:52:32,298 --> 00:52:36,000
Luke: well I mean one of the great things about contemporary small press role-playing games.

968
00:52:36,563 --> 00:52:39,850
Luke: They're so low commitment like you can grab inspectors or lacuna And that's that's.

969
00:52:39,871 --> 00:52:50,600
Jared: that's one of the whole Hallmarks of the the genre because it's pretty much a genre over the past 10 years is you'll learn it that you'll learn the rules Tonight and you'll play it in two to four hours, and it'll be a fun story.

970
00:52:51,363 --> 00:52:56,100
Luke: I mean it's just one thing that you kind of have to acknowledge is that people play role-playing games for a lot of different reasons.

971
00:52:57,021 --> 00:53:02,763
Luke: there's a lot of different ways to to have fun playing a role-playing game and Roll.

972
00:53:03,105 --> 00:53:05,620
Luke: each role-playing game brings a different kind of fun to the table.

973
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:08,220
Luke: I mean or focuses on a different kind of fun.

974
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:15,060
Luke: You know obviously people who have different priorities can play the same game and still have fun within certain tolerances, right?

975
00:53:15,881 --> 00:53:20,906
Luke: Not everyone plays D&D for the same reason, but a lot of groups can get together and and agree We'll play D&D.

976
00:53:20,926 --> 00:53:26,298
Luke: It's cool even though It supports more this style play than the style than this other style of play.

977
00:53:28,801 --> 00:53:46,557
Luke: So one you have to agree when you're starting a new game, that's try something different, but also you have to recognize that there People's like emotional fun is wrapped up in this and so there's gonna be some reticence to try something new some some skepticism and you're kind of fighting against a long history.

978
00:53:46,638 --> 00:53:52,696
Luke: because The how we have fun is we sit down and we play riffs every week, and that's it like we.

979
00:53:52,776 --> 00:53:55,505
Luke: there's no other game There's no other like hey still play riffs.

980
00:53:56,167 --> 00:53:56,387
Luke: Oh hell.

981
00:53:56,407 --> 00:53:57,170
Luke: Yeah.

982
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:58,333
Jared: What's like the poker game right?

983
00:53:58,493 --> 00:54:06,973
Jared: Nobody says hey guys instead of poker this week Everybody you know looks at you like you have three heads.

984
00:54:07,093 --> 00:54:08,460
Luke: Yeah, let's play jungle speed instead of poker.

985
00:54:08,681 --> 00:54:11,034
Rym: They're like jungle speed is a much better game.

986
00:54:11,215 --> 00:54:16,735
Jared: Yeah Certainly dude, let's jungle speed jungle speed jungle speed be a lot more interesting with betting.

987
00:54:16,755 --> 00:54:25,953
Scott: Let me tell you dude Especially if you put the money near the Scott thought he broke jungle speed because we're playing together.

988
00:54:25,994 --> 00:54:27,340
Rym: He just holds his hand like around the thing.

989
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:28,079
Rym: He's like what are you gonna do?

990
00:54:28,301 --> 00:54:29,164
Rym: I'll grab it no matter what.

991
00:54:29,405 --> 00:54:33,965
Rym: so he goes to the guy like the guy who's demoing the game at PAX and the guy's like All right, show me your trick.

992
00:54:34,286 --> 00:54:35,491
Rym: and Scott's like yeah, what are you gonna do?

993
00:54:35,511 --> 00:54:36,676
Rym: I think I just punches his hand.

994
00:54:36,696 --> 00:54:43,483
Jared: Yep That's like jungle speed 101. come on 101.

995
00:54:43,483 --> 00:54:45,009
Scott: we needed it to get going.

996
00:54:45,451 --> 00:54:47,860
Jared: what you do is you bore out the totem and you start stuffing dollar.

997
00:54:47,921 --> 00:54:48,974
Jared: You have a wooden totem.

998
00:54:49,095 --> 00:54:51,260
Scott: Oh, yeah I'll trade you my plastic.

999
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,505
Scott: It's not even solid.

1000
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:57,713
Luke: it's like yeah, it's like a dog toy.

1001
00:54:57,734 --> 00:54:57,794
Jared: Yes.

1002
00:54:57,834 --> 00:54:59,360
Jared: My totem is stained with blood.

1003
00:55:00,823 --> 00:55:03,819
Scott: Can I see your totem so that I can like make my own?

1004
00:55:05,822 --> 00:55:08,691
Jared: That's what she said, yeah, that's my screen name.

1005
00:55:08,932 --> 00:55:10,377
Scott: your screen name is can I make it?

1006
00:55:10,597 --> 00:55:11,360
Scott: can I see your totem?

1007
00:55:13,988 --> 00:55:19,519
Luke: Can I Can I see your totem anyway to get back on track here?

1008
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:22,207
Luke: So that's a great example.

1009
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:25,220
Luke: is you know sitting down for poker night and saying hey, let's play jungle speed?

1010
00:55:25,602 --> 00:55:28,418
Luke: You know, you're basically offering that much of a culture clash to people.

1011
00:55:29,481 --> 00:55:33,840
Jared: So you're upsetting their their their boat that they've been paddling in for a while, right?

1012
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,700
Luke: You know most people play role-playing games.

1013
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,760
Luke: I think want to sit down and play the same character.

1014
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:43,005
Luke: Most people who play role-playing games don't want us don't think about playing role-playing games Like they think about playing a board game.

1015
00:55:43,286 --> 00:55:44,029
Luke: right playing a board game.

1016
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:45,174
Luke: Okay, how am I gonna expand?

1017
00:55:45,736 --> 00:55:46,860
Luke: kind of win this?

1018
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:51,104
Luke: how am I gonna get into these mechanics and and Win the game.

1019
00:55:51,366 --> 00:55:53,740
Luke: you don't think about a role-playing game as a set of mechanics.

1020
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:58,985
Luke: You think about a role-playing game as a setting and a character and the stuff that comes Behind.

1021
00:55:59,025 --> 00:56:07,986
Luke: it is a pain in the ass that gets in the way of you Exploring the setting and playing your character, which is completely and utterly fucking wrong Since the rules are the setting.

1022
00:56:08,006 --> 00:56:10,655
Luke: there's nothing else in a role-playing game, but the rules and the.

1023
00:56:10,956 --> 00:56:11,959
Luke: the rules create the setting.

1024
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:20,447
Luke: No matter what the Annie's say There's nothing else in a game but rules nothing.

1025
00:56:21,549 --> 00:56:22,291
Jared: games are rules.

1026
00:56:22,311 --> 00:56:23,254
Jared: games are instructions.

1027
00:56:23,434 --> 00:56:25,339
Luke: you cannot have a game without rules.

1028
00:56:27,702 --> 00:56:29,334
Jared: Sorry, but what about flux Luke?

1029
00:56:29,354 --> 00:56:30,099
Jared: that has no rules.

1030
00:56:37,368 --> 00:56:40,703
Jared: But what about flux Example?

1031
00:56:40,783 --> 00:56:42,791
Scott: I mean, yeah, they just say they just say what about.

1032
00:56:42,831 --> 00:56:45,080
Rym: but junker most people don't know how to argue.

1033
00:56:46,841 --> 00:56:47,584
Luke: This is also true.

1034
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:48,828
Jared: Just yell louder than everybody else.

1035
00:56:48,888 --> 00:56:50,434
Jared: right most are typing caps.

1036
00:56:50,534 --> 00:56:51,578
Jared: We make arguing the game.

1037
00:56:51,618 --> 00:56:52,140
Scott: That would be good.

1038
00:56:56,744 --> 00:57:01,739
Scott: Well internet arguing the game BBB the game are also bad at following instructions, too.

1039
00:57:01,941 --> 00:57:03,370
Luke: So that that's another thing to acknowledge.

1040
00:57:03,491 --> 00:57:06,580
Luke: when you're you sit down with a new game You kind of want to make it as easy as possible.

1041
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:12,648
Luke: You are essentially the ambassador for a fun time when you sit down with a new game with your friends But I actually wrote a whole chapter on.

1042
00:57:12,688 --> 00:57:17,700
Luke: this is my new book for the burning wheel for the inventor burner is like hey You know you you've got to be cool and everything.

1043
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:22,214
Luke: But honestly the main responsibility in this is on the group.

1044
00:57:22,595 --> 00:57:31,874
Luke: if someone in the group is is Sucking it up and playing rifts or D&D or whatever Every week and they're not having a great time wants to try something different.

1045
00:57:32,135 --> 00:57:32,698
Luke: You know what you're.

1046
00:57:32,718 --> 00:57:37,966
Luke: all friends Say okay, we'll try your game this week We'll try it and we'll give it our best shot.

1047
00:57:38,668 --> 00:57:42,540
Luke: the thing that drives me crazy is the is the passive-aggressive.

1048
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:48,189
Luke: You know we'll try this and and the arms folded Already decided before you started.

1049
00:57:48,209 --> 00:57:49,817
Luke: Yeah, and they just sit there for a couple hours.

1050
00:57:49,857 --> 00:57:50,520
Luke: being like this is stupid.

1051
00:57:52,401 --> 00:57:52,904
Luke: What the fuck?

1052
00:57:53,024 --> 00:57:56,460
Luke: how hard is it for you to open up and you know what and say you're my friend?

1053
00:57:56,701 --> 00:57:58,090
Luke: I'm gonna make sure this is fun for you.

1054
00:57:58,130 --> 00:57:59,035
Rym: I don't think they're really friends.

1055
00:57:59,055 --> 00:57:59,478
Scott: I don't think they're.

1056
00:57:59,498 --> 00:58:09,755
Rym: yeah I think a lot of these people who have these gaming groups and all these like all the drama like every time we do a It's the person who happens to live close enough to you geographically that also wants to play.

1057
00:58:09,775 --> 00:58:10,939
Scott: it's always high school kids.

1058
00:58:10,999 --> 00:58:14,266
Jared: again You feel bad about kicking people out Like they know.

1059
00:58:14,307 --> 00:58:16,020
Rym: like like those are the other five guys.

1060
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:22,220
Scott: It's so difficult to even get this many nerds into a single room in the middle of nowhere.

1061
00:58:22,361 --> 00:58:24,952
Scott: I mean that to lose that is like we got nothing.

1062
00:58:24,972 --> 00:58:26,016
Scott: You know it's either this or nothing.

1063
00:58:26,036 --> 00:58:28,219
Luke: fuck What's up with the disconnect between?

1064
00:58:28,881 --> 00:58:37,586
Luke: What you two and we to see once a month where thousands upon thousands of these nerds are getting together Hanging out at these cons?

1065
00:58:37,626 --> 00:58:40,196
Luke: right we know there's this giant nerd underground.

1066
00:58:40,217 --> 00:58:41,040
Scott: because well, okay.

1067
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,279
Scott: So first of all we're in a city where there's a lot of nerds.

1068
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:49,085
Rym: Yeah, we're a beacon when you're if it weren't for the fact that we brought our own crew with us to beacon There's no gamers there.

1069
00:58:49,426 --> 00:58:51,452
Scott: Yeah, and the second we gotta find him.

1070
00:58:51,713 --> 00:58:56,129
Rym: Yeah, we found it and I think four of them 40 they wanted to play war games.

1071
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:57,314
Scott: right.

1072
00:58:57,334 --> 00:59:04,880
Scott: so the other thing is that you know the Conventions are this one-time thing that gather from a greater geographic area there, maybe that's why conventions exist.

1073
00:59:05,061 --> 00:59:06,024
Scott: Yeah, they're dry exactly.

1074
00:59:06,044 --> 00:59:10,140
Scott: there may be thousands there, but you got to realize that any one of those people goes home to their town.

1075
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:18,682
Scott: They're probably a teenager with no car and the number of people that they actually have to game with on a regular basis is like Four if they're lucky, but at a convention It's.

1076
00:59:18,782 --> 00:59:20,550
Rym: it's always gonna make a much simpler point.

1077
00:59:20,992 --> 00:59:28,000
Rym: every time there's a panel that I'm involved with in any way There's something like how do you a GM or like tell your stories or like you know tell us what's wrong with your game?

1078
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:28,565
Rym: And we'll fix it.

1079
00:59:29,211 --> 00:59:30,200
Rym: It's never about the game.

1080
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,727
Rym: It's always just this personal crazy bullshit.

1081
00:59:32,747 --> 00:59:34,112
Rym: drama is nothing to do with gaming.

1082
00:59:34,392 --> 00:59:36,318
Rym: that seems to be in everyone else's lives, but ours.

1083
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:39,245
Luke: yes Yeah, I don't understand.

1084
00:59:39,305 --> 00:59:39,546
Luke: It's like.

1085
00:59:39,787 --> 00:59:39,968
Luke: well.

1086
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:40,771
Luke: I don't know.

1087
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:43,100
Luke: I guess we have personal drama in our games.

1088
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:46,739
Luke: I've had my friends storm out of my apartment being like I'm not fucking playing a game with you again.

1089
00:59:48,121 --> 00:59:49,968
Jared: Sure Luke will never let me play burning wheel.

1090
00:59:50,229 --> 00:59:52,940
Luke: no Jen Jared and Jared isn't and I are never playing burning wheel together.

1091
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,169
Luke: Yeah, I'll run burning wheel for Jared.

1092
00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:54,894
Luke: That's fine.

1093
00:59:54,914 --> 00:59:59,902
Scott: Yeah burning wheel for me because a pain in the ass to Luke.

1094
00:59:59,942 --> 01:00:03,674
Jared: Luke put out his welcome mat, and I might have shat upon it.

1095
01:00:03,734 --> 01:00:05,520
Jared: shat upon it not not intentionally.

1096
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,966
Rym: You're like you see the sword.

1097
01:00:06,986 --> 01:00:09,175
Jared: I defecate no the sword.

1098
01:00:09,215 --> 01:00:10,360
Jared: I played and I really liked it.

1099
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:10,984
Jared: I played the elf.

1100
01:00:11,064 --> 01:00:11,547
Jared: it was awesome.

1101
01:00:11,809 --> 01:00:12,815
Scott: Yeah, the elf is a good choice.

1102
01:00:12,855 --> 01:00:13,660
Scott: the human is the only one.

1103
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:14,907
Rym: Was my last choice?

1104
01:00:14,927 --> 01:00:18,808
Rym: oh really Yeah, the elf is tricky because I feel like the elf.

1105
01:00:18,828 --> 01:00:21,540
Rym: you feel like you can kick everyone else's asses, and that is not true.

1106
01:00:21,841 --> 01:00:22,504
Luke: That's like.

1107
01:00:22,544 --> 01:00:26,620
Rym: the best part about the scenario is that the elf always tries like just I'll kill the dwarf and it'll be great.

1108
01:00:26,741 --> 01:00:29,399
Jared: And then he's like I'm an elf you're all fucked.

1109
01:00:31,463 --> 01:00:34,960
Scott: The reason I like all of them except the human because it feels like the human.

1110
01:00:35,522 --> 01:00:43,591
Scott: It's hard for him to make a friend because he just he just wants to steal it for his personal reasons Right and so he could try to be friend.

1111
01:00:43,631 --> 01:00:48,273
Scott: the elf for the dwarf right - right But and he can't afford to pay the rat.

1112
01:00:48,334 --> 01:00:49,460
Scott: no one can afford to pay the rat.

1113
01:00:49,601 --> 01:00:56,220
Scott: So he's sort of on his own there, and he's just a jerk But he's not strong enough to actually do anything as any one of the other characters can probably kick his ass.

1114
01:00:56,542 --> 01:00:57,065
Rym: Oh, he's a jerk.

1115
01:00:57,085 --> 01:00:58,392
Rym: You just always play him as a jerk.

1116
01:00:58,674 --> 01:00:59,479
Scott: I think the human is a jerk.

1117
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:00,966
Jared: well They all want to see the sword.

1118
01:01:00,986 --> 01:01:04,302
Jared: He just doesn't have this like family legacy to like back it up He has no.

1119
01:01:04,343 --> 01:01:05,831
Jared: no it's like, but I just want it every.

1120
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:07,420
Luke: no no he has to repay a gambling debt.

1121
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:09,592
Luke: He has no nobility to his claim.

1122
01:01:09,612 --> 01:01:13,543
Luke: right, right, it's very So.

1123
01:01:13,564 --> 01:01:14,910
Rym: you gotta be a noble or you're a jerk.

1124
01:01:15,211 --> 01:01:16,476
Scott: no, it's not being a noble.

1125
01:01:16,537 --> 01:01:17,119
Scott: is that his?

1126
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:20,580
Scott: He only wants the sword for selfish reasons.

1127
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:20,982
Scott: He doesn't.

1128
01:01:21,063 --> 01:01:26,720
Scott: you know he doesn't even have the illusion that they all want the sword for self But they have the illusion of a valid reason.

1129
01:01:27,841 --> 01:01:30,229
Scott: Loud the human has nothing he can say out loud.

1130
01:01:30,249 --> 01:01:30,891
Scott: He can make.

1131
01:01:30,992 --> 01:01:31,975
Scott: that is truthful.

1132
01:01:31,995 --> 01:01:33,640
Jared: well for my wife, right?

1133
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:38,415
Scott: Lying jerk right there's nothing truthful that he can say.

1134
01:01:38,435 --> 01:01:43,430
Scott: that would be a valid External claim for the sword that anyone else would.

1135
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,518
Rym: is you know the dwarf and say we can take these assholes.

1136
01:01:45,538 --> 01:01:45,859
Rym: Let's go.

1137
01:01:46,741 --> 01:01:47,404
Rym: That's what you do.

1138
01:01:47,504 --> 01:01:50,878
Scott: Yeah, but then the dwarf is on you after you take out the elf the.

1139
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:56,384
Luke: so well I'll grant Scott this the human is the hardest Character to win with.

1140
01:01:56,424 --> 01:01:58,090
Rym: so hold me the rat was the hardest one to win.

1141
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:58,271
Luke: No.

1142
01:01:58,291 --> 01:01:58,994
Luke: I changed my mind.

1143
01:01:59,014 --> 01:02:07,539
Luke: I actually that I After further analysis of the sword the human is the hardest to win with the human wins the least and often because.

1144
01:02:09,441 --> 01:02:22,539
Luke: Well I think one because of the reasons that Scott is is pointing out that he you know he he it's hard for a player to sit down and jump in and make him sympathetic or And he's not powerful enough like the dwarf who just come out and be like fuck you all.

1145
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:24,566
Luke: I'm gonna Just do it the rat it turns out.

1146
01:02:24,586 --> 01:02:31,572
Luke: I Just take on all the other characters and beat them down.

1147
01:02:31,612 --> 01:02:35,307
Jared: the rat at uh at packs Oh my god was it.

1148
01:02:35,327 --> 01:02:36,030
Jared: packs packs.

1149
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:37,998
Jared: Easter packs packs packs packs packs.

1150
01:02:38,078 --> 01:02:38,520
Jared: Oh my god.

1151
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:45,927
Luke: Yeah, dude crazy crazy, but the best actually the best Robard the best cute gambler.

1152
01:02:46,008 --> 01:02:52,107
Luke: I saw was at PAX Prime to where the kid Had used his falsetto shit.

1153
01:02:52,127 --> 01:02:53,771
Luke: Yeah had everyone coming and going.

1154
01:02:54,112 --> 01:02:54,453
Luke: he's.

1155
01:02:54,473 --> 01:02:55,435
Jared: he did the forgery right.

1156
01:02:55,896 --> 01:02:57,019
Jared: he had the forged coins.

1157
01:02:57,682 --> 01:02:58,820
Luke: Yeah, he made an unskilled.

1158
01:02:59,504 --> 01:03:00,951
Scott: He paid the rat with fake money.

1159
01:03:00,971 --> 01:03:01,816
Scott: Yeah, he clipped.

1160
01:03:01,836 --> 01:03:02,560
Jared: he clipped the coins.

1161
01:03:02,662 --> 01:03:03,180
Jared: It was awesome.

1162
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:03,842
Luke: And then but he's.

1163
01:03:04,184 --> 01:03:04,625
Luke: and he got.

1164
01:03:04,786 --> 01:03:12,240
Luke: and then he he paid the rat with fake money and then used his falsetto abilities to Convince the rat that it was the dwarf that did it because of the dwarfs greed.

1165
01:03:13,922 --> 01:03:17,454
Luke: And there it's perfect as the rat is a low will he was a perfect mark for the scam.

1166
01:03:17,494 --> 01:03:20,391
Luke: and then the rat who is a Badass bad as a knife.

1167
01:03:20,735 --> 01:03:26,920
Jared: when house The dwarf ended up running off into the caverns, and we never saw me again because we had to end the game.

1168
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:31,751
Jared: But it was like okay the dwarf kind of got away Lost in the caverns.

1169
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:41,597
Scott: hungry Story I have is when I did the circles as the rat and I got more rats You know, but that was you know, I guess that's a little bit better with the forgery.

1170
01:03:41,637 --> 01:03:42,340
Scott: That's that's clever.

1171
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,249
Luke: Yeah, he's a combo attack.

1172
01:03:44,289 --> 01:03:45,193
Jared: That was a kick-ass game.

1173
01:03:45,213 --> 01:03:46,580
Jared: That was like everybody was just bringing it.

1174
01:03:46,701 --> 01:03:47,333
Luke: That was really fun.

1175
01:03:47,901 --> 01:03:53,260
Luke: But yeah, the I have seen I think the human wins the least out of everyone in the sword.

1176
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:59,326
Luke: So if you're listening to this and you're burning will player and you have won with the human if you have played the sword And Robard has come out on top.

1177
01:03:59,366 --> 01:04:00,149
Luke: I want to hear about it.

1178
01:04:00,691 --> 01:04:01,052
Scott: Mmm.

1179
01:04:01,514 --> 01:04:02,699
Jared: Give yourself a round of applause.

1180
01:04:02,759 --> 01:04:03,964
Luke: burning We'll burning wheel.

1181
01:04:03,984 --> 01:04:04,667
Scott: calm you get.

1182
01:04:04,707 --> 01:04:06,595
Scott: you should get a. you should be rewarded for winning with.

1183
01:04:06,936 --> 01:04:17,770
Luke: if you and if you're an experienced Pretty well player and you've played the sword and you've won with the dwarf Play again and play with the human play with Robard because the dwarfs the easiest to win with because the dwarf can just take on like nightmare level.

1184
01:04:19,001 --> 01:04:26,860
Scott: Thing is I've seen the dwarf get dwarf get freaking stabbed, you know, pretty bad by the elf, you know He's not all you know, he's the strongest but he's not always gonna know.

1185
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:28,125
Luke: I mean everything.

1186
01:04:28,145 --> 01:04:32,300
Luke: every character in burning wheel is vulnerable and which I love about the game.

1187
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:36,616
Luke: Well, you know they can all be brought down but just in the burning wheel.

1188
01:04:36,696 --> 01:04:37,500
Jared: Everyone has a groin.

1189
01:04:38,503 --> 01:04:39,474
Jared: That's what Luke's trying to say.

1190
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:46,139
Scott: I Have a specific burning wheel question.

1191
01:04:47,302 --> 01:04:49,190
Scott: Do the dwarven females?

1192
01:04:49,210 --> 01:04:51,660
Scott: because there is a. there is a question.

1193
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:55,380
Scott: Yeah, it says in the in the character burner dwarven trait bearded.

1194
01:04:55,901 --> 01:04:59,451
Luke: So do the female dwarves have beards cannot play a female dwarf from burning wheel.

1195
01:04:59,592 --> 01:05:00,093
Scott: You can't.

1196
01:05:00,233 --> 01:05:02,319
Jared: oh, oh, yeah, it's there's no life path.

1197
01:05:03,684 --> 01:05:05,239
Luke: You cannot play a female dwarf from burning wheel.

1198
01:05:06,083 --> 01:05:07,689
Jared: We're wrong this is?

1199
01:05:07,789 --> 01:05:10,740
Rym: we just assume that men and women were all bearded.

1200
01:05:10,921 --> 01:05:12,808
Luke: Well, I mean you can be a bearded women.

1201
01:05:12,868 --> 01:05:15,679
Jared: and this this came up at the at the the.

1202
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:17,206
Luke: yeah We were joking about a company.

1203
01:05:17,327 --> 01:05:17,890
Luke: No, the series.

1204
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:28,677
Luke: All right, then a serious answer is dwarfs have a conservative society to the point of fascism and you can only.

1205
01:05:30,622 --> 01:05:32,568
Luke: The only dwarves in matter are male dwarfs.

1206
01:05:32,969 --> 01:05:36,860
Luke: essentially in dwarven society doors are assholes, they're giant greedy assholes.

1207
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:37,642
Rym: They're not that giant.

1208
01:05:38,003 --> 01:05:39,807
Luke: Well, I mean I ride there.

1209
01:05:39,847 --> 01:05:41,171
Luke: They're meta asshole.

1210
01:05:41,211 --> 01:05:42,253
Luke: property is giant.

1211
01:05:42,474 --> 01:05:44,700
Luke: I'm sure a dwarven asshole is quite giant.

1212
01:05:46,965 --> 01:05:48,336
Jared: We just lost the Poughkeepsie.

1213
01:05:54,308 --> 01:05:56,930
Jared: I Was thinking somewhere in the Midwest.

1214
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:57,794

Luke: Yeah, that's.

1217
01:06:01,802 --> 01:06:03,293
Luke: I've been to the Polish men's club up there.

1218
01:06:03,313 --> 01:06:04,240

Scott: they like to play role-playing.

1222
01:06:10,612 --> 01:06:12,035
Luke: I was some rock and roll.

1223
01:06:12,316 --> 01:06:12,557
Scott: Okay.

1224
01:06:13,859 --> 01:06:15,272
Jared: Oh I remember when you went to that show.

1225
01:06:15,292 --> 01:06:15,898
Jared: It's a jay-zoo, right?

1226
01:06:16,363 --> 01:06:18,984
Rym: So, yeah, I suppose we can wrap this up But I guess now's the time.

1227
01:06:19,064 --> 01:06:21,114
Rym: what games should people out there be playing?

1228
01:06:21,134 --> 01:06:22,179
Rym: because people always come to us?

1229
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:23,900
Rym: now You know because we talk about burning wheel a lot.

1230
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:28,780
Rym: We play burning wheel we do the panels and they come back and they're like I played burning wheel and I played inspectors.

1231
01:06:29,584 --> 01:06:30,437
Rym: What should I play now?

1232
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:38,804
Luke: Well, if you saw inception and you want a legitimate inception experience one of my favorite role-playing games ever happens to be by the guy Who's sitting next to me?

1233
01:06:39,106 --> 01:06:40,214
Luke: I know I'm a big suck-up.

1234
01:06:40,254 --> 01:06:44,560
Luke: but lacuna It's a few years old, but it's uh, it's doing well.

1235
01:06:45,181 --> 01:06:46,405
Luke: It's so aged very well.

1236
01:06:46,667 --> 01:06:50,060
Jared: Well all these Inceptions threads have been like driving sales.

1237
01:06:50,201 --> 01:06:54,399
Jared: It's so yeah, that's actually that and the parsley games are my best sellers by far.

1238
01:06:54,801 --> 01:06:58,960
Scott: I mean like I. when I first saw lacuna I bought it cuz you recommended it at the uber con.

1239
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,100
Rym: We even did the thing like I didn't read the book.

1240
01:07:02,041 --> 01:07:03,328
Rym: Yeah, I tried to like follow it.

1241
01:07:03,669 --> 01:07:04,574
Scott: I read I read them.

1242
01:07:04,594 --> 01:07:05,659
Scott: I was the only one who read the book.

1243
01:07:06,642 --> 01:07:09,604
Scott: Alex I think also read it but I Didn't.

1244
01:07:09,747 --> 01:07:13,660
Scott: when I saw the book I didn't think it was a game that could be played sort of like one of those games.

1245
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:15,393
Scott: That's just they make a game.

1246
01:07:15,433 --> 01:07:16,943
Scott: Yeah, like all right It's a game.

1247
01:07:17,124 --> 01:07:19,740
Scott: someone makes a game book, but you're not actually supposed to play this game.

1248
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:22,634
Scott: I mean kill puppies for Satan is almost one of those, you know, it's like.

1249
01:07:22,654 --> 01:07:23,840
Scott: you're not actually supposed to play this.

1250
01:07:23,961 --> 01:07:26,575
Scott: It's just a humorous book that happens to be in the form.

1251
01:07:26,615 --> 01:07:27,560
Luke: You can really kill puppies.

1252
01:07:27,641 --> 01:07:28,466
Scott: But yeah, I know you can't.

1253
01:07:28,507 --> 01:07:30,360
Scott: but I thought lacuna was unplayable.

1254
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:34,012
Scott: But actually we played it and it was like it was like completely the opposite.

1255
01:07:34,032 --> 01:07:35,116
Scott: It was extremely playable.

1256
01:07:35,336 --> 01:07:36,400
Scott: I was I was quite surprised.

1257
01:07:37,443 --> 01:07:41,748
Luke: Yeah, I mean one of the Jokes in lacuna.

1258
01:07:42,272 --> 01:07:42,654
Luke: Is that right?

1259
01:07:42,675 --> 01:07:43,420
Luke: It's an unfinished game.

1260
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,971
Luke: Well, all role-playing games are unfinished right?

1261
01:07:45,031 --> 01:07:51,752
Luke: all role-playing games or you know the vast majority of them require you to make up some rules and Sit down and kind of fill in the last.

1262
01:07:52,195 --> 01:07:52,939
Jared: there's huge.

1263
01:07:53,181 --> 01:07:59,409
Jared: There's three things I can think of off the top of my head in lacuna which are not explained in the game which are Necessary to play the game.

1264
01:08:00,013 --> 01:08:02,545
Jared: if you don't answer those questions It's impossible to plays.

1265
01:08:02,565 --> 01:08:03,588
Jared: they play the game but it's.

1266
01:08:04,130 --> 01:08:06,860
Luke: but the part of the game is just answering those questions.

1267
01:08:07,822 --> 01:08:10,606
Luke: That's that's the important Aspect.

1268
01:08:10,626 --> 01:08:14,529
Luke: it's not that you Can't answer them or whatever you.

1269
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:17,499
Luke: you will answer them and you have to answer them in order to play the game.

1270
01:08:18,322 --> 01:08:19,987
Rym: Somewhere I have in the archives.

1271
01:08:20,549 --> 01:08:23,798
Rym: I recorded the entire game that you guys played of lacuna and Wildwood.

1272
01:08:24,078 --> 01:08:26,319
Scott: Oh, yeah That's gotta be somewhere in the archives.

1273
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:30,251
Luke: That's an ancient ass recording so more more modern like my.

1274
01:08:30,532 --> 01:08:33,220
Luke: my current pick from last year was kagamatsu by Daniel Luan.

1275
01:08:33,584 --> 01:08:37,526
Scott: Let me write that down Tell me tell me all about it.

1276
01:08:38,067 --> 01:08:42,256
Scott: So kagamatsu is it k a g a ma tsu.

1277
01:08:42,277 --> 01:08:47,344
Luke: Yeah, okay kagamatsu by Daniel Luan and Full disclosure.

1278
01:08:47,444 --> 01:08:55,216
Luke: I designed the cover for it after she asked me to Her other cover artist punked out The.

1279
01:08:56,402 --> 01:08:58,276
Jared: The cover is also nominated for a day.

1280
01:08:58,316 --> 01:08:58,819
Jared: No, it's not.

1281
01:08:58,979 --> 01:09:05,026
Luke: No, I'm not a for Dan and Jones Ward, but it is nominated for Dan and Jones Ward and it's a game about medieval Japan.

1282
01:09:05,247 --> 01:09:05,915
Scott: and oh, is that it?

1283
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:07,625
Scott: That's it.

1284
01:09:07,645 --> 01:09:08,854
Scott: Wow, that's a fantastic cover.

1285
01:09:08,894 --> 01:09:12,527
Jared: Holy crap The book itself is really really beautiful.

1286
01:09:12,567 --> 01:09:12,767
Jared: Yeah,

1287
01:09:12,928 --> 01:09:32,721
Luke: you play women of a village that is in peril in kagamatsu and a Samurai a wandering samurai, maybe Ronan or whatever wanders into the village and you each have your own reason to try to lure him over to your side to ally with him or romance him or whatever and The.

1288
01:09:33,104 --> 01:09:39,660
Luke: the game is just really elegant like very simple mechanics Like and it's high concept, right?

1289
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,908
Luke: It's a samurai romance and the.

1290
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:43,573
Luke: it's got gender-bending rules.

1291
01:09:43,774 --> 01:09:55,239
Luke: the if you have a woman in the group She plays kagamatsu and the boys all play the women and That's a correct assumption.

1292
01:09:56,142 --> 01:09:59,199
Luke: It's probably a fair assumption, but it says like adventure has similar assumptions.

1293
01:10:00,601 --> 01:10:11,849
Luke: that is also true if it just says basically if there's an if there's an imbalance make sure that the the girl plays Plays the voice samurai, which is cool.

1294
01:10:11,889 --> 01:10:12,611
Luke: It's you know, it's it's.

1295
01:10:12,872 --> 01:10:23,174
Luke: so it's a bit of a thought experiment there it but it also It makes you conscious of the gender roles and it makes it a little less skeevy When the boys are trying to romance the girl.

1296
01:10:23,838 --> 01:10:28,619
Luke: in that case I mean, I can see you playing it the other way, but I like the fact that's a conceit in the game.

1297
01:10:29,521 --> 01:10:31,329
Luke: Yeah, the actual mechanics are very simple.

1298
01:10:31,349 --> 01:10:32,475
Luke: It has an endgame mechanic.

1299
01:10:32,555 --> 01:10:37,860
Luke: It has priorities Player priorities which are important to me as a player and a game designer.

1300
01:10:38,962 --> 01:10:39,810
Luke: Yeah, and it's just short.

1301
01:10:39,972 --> 01:10:40,779
Luke: It's just short and sweet.

1302
01:10:41,982 --> 01:10:44,900
Luke: And I mean, I kind of think it's the state of the art for like games.

1303
01:10:46,462 --> 01:10:53,352
Luke: At this point in our like history as a community of small press games producers Like this should be the bare minimum of quality that we should be producing.

1304
01:10:53,392 --> 01:11:00,440
Luke: They should be you know, well-designed simple You know with you know, nice mechanics that play to the concept.

1305
01:11:01,403 --> 01:11:07,283
Luke: I don't think we should be designing D&D over and over again and fucking that's like The human.

1306
01:11:07,343 --> 01:11:14,520
Luke: Oh to me that's like you've curled into a ball and are jerking off into your own mouth like Like what the fuck it's a human centipede.

1307
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,584
Rym: I Have not seen that yet.

1308
01:11:19,046 --> 01:11:20,412
Luke: I'm not never going to see that.

1309
01:11:20,713 --> 01:11:22,220
Luke: really I can't do it.

1310
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:24,048
Luke: I don't like movies like that.

1311
01:11:24,068 --> 01:11:25,073
Rym: I've seen each of the killer.

1312
01:11:25,093 --> 01:11:26,599

01:11:26,881 --> 01:11:28,310
Scott: I don't know what I don't know you're talking about.

1376
01:13:54,106 --> 01:13:59,039
Jared: I'm gonna try to play at Gen Con or at least buy it because it's actually the first role-playing game I've wanted to buy in a long time.

1377
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,265

01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:03,752
Jared: It's fascinating.

1380
01:14:04,475 --> 01:14:04,936
Jared: It's called.

1381
01:14:05,177 --> 01:14:06,240
Jared: you guys know about a fiasco.

1382
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:08,371
Scott: Oh, I believe that yesterday.

1383
01:14:08,391 --> 01:14:08,853
Jared: It was awesome.

1384
01:14:09,376 --> 01:14:12,275
Jared: It was well I'm not buying it then.

1385
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,484
Scott: Okay,

1386
01:14:14,505 --> 01:14:15,610
Luke: we only played it once,

1387
01:14:15,831 --> 01:14:16,173
Scott: you know, did you

1388
01:14:16,193 --> 01:14:16,936
Jared: have a girl in your group?

1389
01:14:17,258 --> 01:14:17,620
Scott: Yeah, we had.

1390
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:26,254
Scott: That's just not natural, okay, so Basically, I mean we kind of want to do a show on.

1391
01:14:26,274 --> 01:14:27,800
Scott: if we can make this the show on fiasco.

1392
01:14:28,122 --> 01:14:33,144
Luke: It would take a lot of time, but basically Didn't give the care.

1393
01:14:33,164 --> 01:14:40,117
Rym: like basically our people got to into the role-playing so the game went on way too long Because it was the reverse of it.

1394
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:50,539
Scott: basically the game told us that the whole game should have taken two and a half hours right and By like an it was already like an hour and a half and we weren't even half done with the first act and there were Two acts right?

1395
01:14:50,841 --> 01:14:54,860
Scott: So we were 25% done when we should have been three quarters time play with like an egg timer or something.

1396
01:14:55,201 --> 01:14:55,342
Jared: Well,

1397
01:14:55,382 --> 01:15:06,529
Scott: the thing was is that the mechanic of the game is that you go around turns to making scenes right right and the scene and then everybody should You either establish the scene or resolve the scene right

1398
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:16,080
Rym: you're establishing because that's like most people would establish that you establish the scene And then as you roleplay it out And the weird part is a lot of the scenes will end up being you just kind of monologuing or explaining.

1399
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,889
Jared: Wow So it is one of those.

1400
01:15:18,211 --> 01:15:19,278
Jared: it is like the movies that it's.

1401
01:15:19,298 --> 01:15:24,319
Rym: yeah Or you can bring like other characters in and interact but then the other players kind of wink and nod at each other.

1402
01:15:24,339 --> 01:15:29,123
Rym: eventually They pick up a black dye or a white dye to tell you the scene is gonna go badly for you Or it's gonna go.

1403
01:15:29,143 --> 01:15:31,318
Jared: well, so it's a. sit around a table make shit up game.

1404
01:15:31,358 --> 01:15:33,272
Jared: Yes Okay, I don't want to get any more Morningstar.

1405
01:15:33,292 --> 01:15:33,695
Jared: You suck.

1406
01:15:33,775 --> 01:15:36,283
Rym: It is very It's very.

1407
01:15:36,343 --> 01:15:39,820
Rym: it is very good mechanics for building the world and building the relationship with the characters.

1408
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:42,249
Rym: Well, it's very mechanics light for everything else.

1409
01:15:42,631 --> 01:15:43,855
Jared: The play sets are really cool.

1410
01:15:43,875 --> 01:15:45,040
Jared: I really like the place.

1411
01:15:45,645 --> 01:15:46,613
Scott: I also like the place.

1412
01:15:46,654 --> 01:15:47,340
Scott: that's a whole lot.

1413
01:15:47,621 --> 01:15:53,838
Scott: The problem was is that when we actually when it's time to do a scene We might roleplay way too much and I'm like I was like, whoa.

1414
01:15:53,959 --> 01:15:57,867
Scott: Okay I mean, this is awesome role-playing going on But we have to shoot to do.

1415
01:15:57,987 --> 01:16:02,668
Scott: we have to pick a black or a white dye and this is only supposed to take two and a half hours even work.

1416
01:16:02,688 --> 01:16:09,719
Rym: because because the way people role-playing Four characters are involved in this scene and the result is good and bad and vividly.

1417
01:16:09,739 --> 01:16:15,260
Rym: for yeah It's like it's supposed to be on the Apache skeleton in the cellar, but the Apaches are now.

1418
01:16:15,541 --> 01:16:23,300
Scott: Yeah, if it's my turn and it's my scene the black or white dye is supposed to say whether it's good or bad for me In terms of the conflict of the scene.

1419
01:16:23,665 --> 01:16:29,860
Scott: but if the scene has a Reconflict or maybe black or white actually might be a bad or good consequence for the other person.

1420
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:30,966
Scott: It's not even their turn.

1421
01:16:31,328 --> 01:16:32,394
Scott: So it's not you're not.

1422
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:33,560
Scott: I was like, is that even right?

1423
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:34,317
Scott: Can we do that?

1424
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:41,524
Scott: like a white dye on my turn when I'm resolving kills that kills Rym on his when it's not his turn and he's not the Spotlights not on him.

1425
01:16:41,605 --> 01:16:42,469
Scott: and I was like, is that right?

1426
01:16:42,912 --> 01:16:44,360
Scott: The book didn't really give a lot of help there.

1427
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,228
Jared: So I'm gonna assume that you just played it wrong.

1428
01:16:47,329 --> 01:16:47,529
Scott: It's pie.

1429
01:16:47,610 --> 01:16:50,340
Scott: It's very possible very possible that we have played it wrong.

1430
01:16:51,623 --> 01:16:53,236
Scott: We're going to try it again for sure.

1431
01:16:53,276 --> 01:16:53,800
Rym: give up on things.

1432
01:16:53,921 --> 01:16:58,340
Scott: I mean don't count this as a review of a game that we played once and didn't even finish playing.

1433
01:16:58,643 --> 01:17:00,136
Jared: So because who would do that?

1434
01:17:02,905 --> 01:17:04,380
Luke: We got a plane we never have to us.

1435
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:07,680
Scott: We got to play it more times and finish it to have an accurate assessment.

1436
01:17:07,781 --> 01:17:08,142
Scott: But that was.

1437
01:17:08,203 --> 01:17:09,047
Scott: that was just well, that's.

1438
01:17:09,107 --> 01:17:10,696
Scott: that was what happened the first time we played.

1439
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:12,183
Jared: that's one of the games I'm interested in.

1440
01:17:12,224 --> 01:17:14,455
Jared: I haven't played it yet, but I'm very I'm very curious.

1441
01:17:14,475 --> 01:17:18,117
Scott: Yeah, just reading the book It's it's interesting and the playsets are awesome.

1442
01:17:18,157 --> 01:17:18,660
Jared: It looks great.

1443
01:17:19,562 --> 01:17:21,113
Rym: Just every individual scene.

1444
01:17:21,133 --> 01:17:25,900
Rym: just Let make it end quickly like get to some sort of conclusion.

1445
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:29,154
Jared: That's I think that's good advice for any game for any role-playing game.

1446
01:17:29,275 --> 01:17:30,400
Jared: Yeah, get it done.

1447
01:17:30,681 --> 01:17:33,110
Scott: I think the problem is that was unnatural for our group.

1448
01:17:33,271 --> 01:17:35,841
Rym: our group people like to really like it in character and start act Cuz.

1449
01:17:35,861 --> 01:17:37,470
Rym: people are because we have some actors in the group.

1450
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:37,892
Rym: So people

1451
01:17:37,912 --> 01:17:39,360
Jared: start actually well, there's your problem

1452
01:17:39,982 --> 01:17:41,296
Luke: Actors the worst role players ever.

1453
01:17:45,524 --> 01:17:46,326
Scott: Okay, so why don't we?

1454
01:17:46,687 --> 01:17:48,693
Scott: why don't we wrap this up and we'll discuss?

1455
01:17:48,933 --> 01:17:51,822
Scott: I guess just pimp whatever you you want to pimp You know.

1456
01:17:51,923 --> 01:17:55,178
Rym: for for people to spend money right now, what will make you money?

1457
01:17:55,399 --> 01:17:57,563
Luke: Well The adventure burner.

1458
01:17:57,584 --> 01:17:58,185
Luke: Oh, what's that?

1459
01:17:58,226 --> 01:17:58,506
Scott: What's it?

1460
01:17:58,546 --> 01:17:59,871
Luke: What's in that for burning wheel?

1461
01:18:00,392 --> 01:18:02,920
Luke: It's book five out of five books.

1462
01:18:03,163 --> 01:18:06,391
Rym: Are we gonna get Options and skills.

1463
01:18:06,431 --> 01:18:07,258
Scott: That's a definitive.

1464
01:18:07,581 --> 01:18:10,376
Scott: I mean when the magic burner came out, did you say that it was four of four?

1465
01:18:10,437 --> 01:18:10,940
Scott: or did you sit?

1466
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:13,048
Luke: No, it's burning match burners four or five.

1467
01:18:13,249 --> 01:18:13,892
Scott: Okay, so it is.

1468
01:18:13,952 --> 01:18:14,535
Scott: No, that's it.

1469
01:18:14,575 --> 01:18:15,057
Scott: We're done.

1470
01:18:15,158 --> 01:18:15,560
Luke: core books.

1471
01:18:16,082 --> 01:18:17,467
Luke: Okay, burning will core books like folks.

1472
01:18:17,507 --> 01:18:19,554
Scott: All right, so blossoms are falling doesn't count.

1473
01:18:19,735 --> 01:18:21,060
Luke: blossoms and jihad don't come.

1474
01:18:21,724 --> 01:18:24,440
Luke: Serpent Sun doesn't count paths of spite, but a dark elves doesn't count, right?

1475
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:25,563
Luke: So we'll do more stuff like that.

1476
01:18:25,624 --> 01:18:29,699
Luke: But as far as like core book mechanic stuff that's done.

1477
01:18:30,862 --> 01:18:49,954
Luke: so adventure burner contains adventures advice on setting up Situation or adventures in burning wheel and then commentary about a hundred and fifty pages of commentary Like basically the majority of the book majority of the book Make an audio commentary version of that or reading.

1478
01:18:50,657 --> 01:18:50,877
Jared: Sure.

1479
01:18:50,978 --> 01:18:51,520
Jared: That'd be awesome.

1480
01:18:51,721 --> 01:18:55,640
Scott: Yeah, cuz I mean, you know burning wheel itself doesn't really work as an audiobook so much.

1481
01:18:55,760 --> 01:19:00,860
Scott: But if the adventure burner would the adventure burner probably would work as an audiobook and you don't have to like go through audible.

1482
01:19:00,961 --> 01:19:02,368
Scott: Whatever, you know, you could just be like here.

1483
01:19:02,509 --> 01:19:03,795
Scott: buy the mp3 on my site.

1484
01:19:03,956 --> 01:19:04,398
Luke: That's cool.

1485
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:04,680
Luke: Sure.

1486
01:19:05,801 --> 01:19:06,725
Luke: So yeah, 25 bucks.

1487
01:19:06,926 --> 01:19:07,809
Luke: It's got a green cover.

1488
01:19:07,930 --> 01:19:09,717
Luke: It has the sweetest wheel.

1489
01:19:09,898 --> 01:19:10,400
Jared: It's sweet.

1490
01:19:11,302 --> 01:19:13,276
Luke: It's a wheel of skull and skulls and weapons.

1491
01:19:13,578 --> 01:19:15,840
Jared: Oh Anybody.

1492
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:25,866
Jared: Yeah, you gotta say I gotta say I helped Luke with the the final editing pass that we did a big party and so I Got to read the whole thing several times.

1493
01:19:25,926 --> 01:19:29,299
Jared: and I gotta say anybody who's interested in role-playing games should really check it out.

1494
01:19:29,921 --> 01:19:36,568
Jared: Anybody who bought Robin laws is a guide to good Robin's laws Game mastering book.

1495
01:19:36,910 --> 01:19:48,312
Jared: I can't remember the full title, but Anybody who's into that kind of stuff should should read adventure burner because it's a lot of good advice about any game Which is hilarious because I specifically wrote against that.

1496
01:19:48,614 --> 01:19:50,220
Luke: I made sure the instructions in the adventure.

1497
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:52,167
Luke: It's very specific only for burning wheel.

1498
01:19:52,207 --> 01:19:54,334
Luke: I know it is not the instructions.

1499
01:19:54,354 --> 01:19:56,160
Luke: the adventure burner not apply to any other game.

1500
01:19:56,180 --> 01:19:57,128
Luke: They don't apply to mouse guard.

1501
01:19:57,148 --> 01:19:58,540
Luke: They don't apply to burning empires.

1502
01:19:58,821 --> 01:19:59,323
Luke: They don't apply.

1503
01:19:59,363 --> 01:20:03,015
Jared: having read it as a player else as a player with problems.

1504
01:20:04,339 --> 01:20:05,669
Jared: I Found it you very useful.

1505
01:20:05,689 --> 01:20:07,080
Scott: I found a lot of problems.

1506
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:07,864
Scott: So that would help.

1507
01:20:07,924 --> 01:20:08,085

Rym: Remember where we do because we dropped Otakon So where we have a spot free in the schedule now.

1514
01:20:22,383 --> 01:20:24,900
Rym: No, we're kind of backing away from a lot of the anime cons move more toward the weather.

01:22:34,475 --> 01:22:35,440
Scott: I don't do patches really.

1570
01:22:35,581 --> 01:22:36,223
Scott: Maybe I should start.

1571
01:22:36,243 --> 01:22:37,087
Rym: you should do patches.

1572
01:22:37,428 --> 01:22:38,854

1575
01:22:50,207 --> 01:22:51,653
Scott: We did say that that's not real.

1576
01:22:51,673 --> 01:22:53,219
Scott: I don't think that's enough to make anyone buy it.

1577
01:22:53,482 --> 01:23:06,467
Luke: No Transhumanist science fiction role-playing game in which you cooperate Donate and And friend and friend make friends and make friends.

1578
01:23:06,868 --> 01:23:08,693
Jared: It's not nearly as hippie-dippie as it sounds.

1579
01:23:08,793 --> 01:23:09,916
Luke: It's actually rather cutthroat.

1580
01:23:09,976 --> 01:23:15,473
Scott: It's very ruthless and Violent and Frowny face and I was violent.

1581
01:23:15,715 --> 01:23:18,468
Luke: well It hurts when you get a little frowny.

1582
01:23:18,488 --> 01:23:24,177
Scott: I didn't even see it coming and he gave me a frowny face, and I was just like So yeah, it's.

1583
01:23:25,321 --> 01:23:28,271
Luke: We tried we really really tried to make a science fiction role-playing game.

1584
01:23:28,291 --> 01:23:32,504
Luke: That's not just about pirate romance and shooting guns Pirate romance.

1585
01:23:33,006 --> 01:23:45,124
Luke: Yeah, I love my pirate romance too, but it's in this case the game is much more about As Jared has said many occasions time space and identity rather than Exactly.

1586
01:23:45,325 --> 01:23:46,773
Jared: we took a lot of the the themes.

1587
01:23:46,813 --> 01:24:09,620
Jared: we did a lot of research both science fiction books like Schismatrix and snow crash and Neuromancer and down out in the Magic Kingdom and Which was a huge inspiration and then also stuff like Malcolm Gladwell's books tipping point tipping point link and Books on astronomy and books on pirate utopias by a that guy can never remember his name

1588
01:24:10,445 --> 01:24:11,272

01:24:17,234 --> 01:24:19,060
Jared: We did research on this is true.

1593
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:26,569
Jared: I forgot about that physics and medicine and and It's a crazy game We did some research on space too.

1594
01:24:26,589 --> 01:24:27,152
Jared: Yeah.

1595
01:24:27,232 --> 01:24:33,087

01:24:42,693 --> 01:24:43,640
Scott: I'm trying to hype it up to.

1604
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:50,440
Scott: So unlike burning wheel, which is a pile of books there's other there's goodies in there.

1605
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:51,748
Scott: Yeah, this is kind of a trick.

Luke: But yeah $60 for the box set.

1613
01:25:18,841 --> 01:25:31,284
Luke: It's a very pretty box set and it's also hilarious that for some reason people will pay $60 for a single Single hardback book single hardback book like road trader, but they look at our box set for $60 and they go That's too much.

1614
01:25:31,325 --> 01:25:32,731

Jared: we followed the the one that we espouse that we actually followed for this game Where we actually sat down and went wait a minute.

1647
01:27:19,368 --> 01:27:20,614
Jared: Are we doing what we say we do?

1648
01:27:20,674 --> 01:27:24,067
Scott: and mmm Yeah, I noticed that we do that a lot too.

1649
01:27:24,168 --> 01:27:30,859
Scott: is we'll like you're doing the how to run a panel panel and we're basically We we like do as we say don't do as we do because we didn't do anything.

01:27:30,879 --> 01:27:32,466
Scott: we said Right.

1651
01:27:32,827 --> 01:27:33,108
Scott: It's like.

1652
01:27:33,189 --> 01:27:35,960
Scott: it's like because once you're the expert you don't need to follow these rules.

1653
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:42,351
Jared: But trust me if you follow these rules that I don't follow for this game We actually went back to our core kind of guidelines and went.

1654
01:27:42,411 --> 01:27:42,712
Jared: Okay.

1655
01:27:42,793 --> 01:27:44,980

Jared: What are you doing?

1658
01:27:49,771 --> 01:27:56,799
Luke: And we at one point did not really know We actually used our process that we push on people.

1659
01:27:57,721 --> 01:27:59,829
Rym: This is like proof that it is a good process.

1660
01:28:00,191 --> 01:28:02,198
Luke: Well, you'll be the judge of that.

1661
01:28:02,258 --> 01:28:04,638
