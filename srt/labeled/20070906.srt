Scott: Yeah, so I've been.

18
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:02,964
Scott: we've been melting in the office all week.

19
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:04,349
Scott: I'm totally leaving early tomorrow.

20
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,751
Scott: There's no way.

21
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:06,278
Scott: I'm staying there all day in the melting.

22
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:12,019
Rym: see the last time that happened to me at my company has happened twice Both times in like the first couple days of August.

23
00:01:12,059 --> 00:01:14,045
Rym: where be sitting there working on something.

24
00:01:14,547 --> 00:01:15,550
Rym: suddenly the power goes out.

25
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:17,115
Rym: Great, no computers.

26
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:20,346
Rym: What am I gonna do in an IT job?

27
00:01:20,386 --> 00:01:21,330
Scott: Don't they have UPS's?

28
00:01:22,131 --> 00:01:24,510
Rym: Yeah, and the data center not on like my office.

29
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:33,050
Rym: so then all right power comes back on AC doesn't come back on and It's Yonkers, and it's hot and that building is an old converted warehouse.

30
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:40,170
Rym: I mean, it's nice office space now, but it got mighty warm mighty quick, and I went home along with everyone else.

31
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:43,145
Scott: Yeah, I'm not spending a lot of time at work tomorrow.

32
00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:45,897
Rym: That's for sure though It was particularly miserably hot today.

33
00:01:45,937 --> 00:01:49,190
Rym: Just because uh I didn't get a chance to shower this morning.

34
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,824
Rym: I wonder why I didn't get a chance to shower.

35
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:52,910
Scott: It's not my fault.

36
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:58,047
Rym: You could know my fault that Scott spent an hour in the shower doing an hour in there.

37
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,346
Rym: Well, I mean because he tried to buy those shoes back at Otakon.

38
00:02:02,647 --> 00:02:03,230
Rym: They didn't match.

39
00:02:07,513 --> 00:02:10,683
Rym: So he spends forever in there, you know am I gonna put the hair up?

40
00:02:10,744 --> 00:02:12,550
Rym: and I can put the hair down maybe in a bow.

41
00:02:13,431 --> 00:02:16,970
Rym: And so I wake up at like six and I look and Scott Scott.

42
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:23,266
Scott: So I don't think you're up at six because I remember waking up at six But I also remember waking up at six thirty Are you sure?

43
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,664
Scott: Because I definitely got out of the shower at seven because I was awake by the yes seven.

44
00:02:27,725 --> 00:02:35,612
Scott: when we usually all leave for the Train station when we're usually all already it seems like any day when I shave you always yell at me for being in there too Long.

45
00:02:35,692 --> 00:02:43,930
Scott: so I think I just can't shave during the week without you yelling at well You gotta stop putting on all that makeup and you gotta stop putting your hair up actually about shaving.

46
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,785
Scott: Finally, how long have we been shaving the old-school way?

47
00:02:47,805 --> 00:02:50,536
Rym: Uh God a couple years now, right?

48
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,965
Scott: I was still on my first tub of cream.

49
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:56,801
Scott: Well, it's unlike all you other people I don't use an inordinate amount of it.

50
00:02:56,902 --> 00:02:57,766
Rym: I don't use the tubs.

51
00:02:57,806 --> 00:02:58,953
Rym: Don't talk to me I'm just.

52
00:02:59,134 --> 00:03:01,390
Scott: I'm just saying like my dad also he uses way too much.

53
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,530
Scott: He already be burned through a tub in like a few months and I'm like you're using too much.

54
00:03:04,941 --> 00:03:05,491
Rym: Not really I think.

55
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:08,308
Rym: the thing is you don't shave that often and your hair is actually not.

56
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:10,741
Rym: It's not quite the Brillo pad.

57
00:03:10,761 --> 00:03:11,786
Rym: you'd expect it to be like.

58
00:03:11,826 --> 00:03:12,047
Rym: it seems.

59
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:16,404
Scott: it's a pretty Bad, but the point is that even though I shave less often.

60
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:17,870
Scott: I also use less cream.

61
00:03:18,051 --> 00:03:21,343
Scott: Anyway, I finally I mostly ran out.

62
00:03:21,424 --> 00:03:22,046
Scott: I ran out.

63
00:03:22,106 --> 00:03:23,090
Scott: There's still some in there.

64
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,989
Rym: I got to the point where it's just kind of crappy to use it.

65
00:03:25,131 --> 00:03:29,708
Scott: Yeah, I could probably shave with it But you know not and also recently I have been noticing that.

66
00:03:29,728 --> 00:03:37,598
Scott: you know Like I remember when I first started shaving the awesome way that it was like wiping my face of the sponge and it I Realized it hasn't been like that in a while.

67
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:38,181
Scott: Really?

68
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:38,562
Scott: Yeah.

69
00:03:38,603 --> 00:03:44,450
Scott: Well, I opening up the new tub I realized why I've been using the dregs of some tub of.

70
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:50,450
Scott: So now using the new tub, it's back to the sponge on face hair goes away action.

71
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,113
Scott: It's good times.

72
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:59,169
Rym: actually now that I've gone with the puck a full-size pocket shaving soap Even if you use like stupid amounts of it lasts for over a year.

73
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,042
Scott: Didn't last you a year.

74
00:04:01,102 --> 00:04:02,190
Scott: You're already on your second puck.

75
00:04:02,338 --> 00:04:03,794
Scott: No He's only doing it for a few months.

76
00:04:03,814 --> 00:04:10,216
Rym: that first puck was a half-sized puck and the second puck is twice as big Because it's a normal sized puck.

77
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:11,280
Rym: and so far.

78
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:12,666
Rym: It hasn't changed in size at all.

79
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:13,730
Scott: I'm not a fan of your puck.

80
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,215
Rym: I like my pocket sandalwood.

81
00:04:15,235 --> 00:04:16,218
Rym: I really like sandalwood.

82
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:16,961
Scott: your puck sucks.

83
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,608
Rym: I had lavender before but also sex.

84
00:04:21,231 --> 00:04:24,370
Rym: But anyway speaking of all that I don't really have a segue here at all.

85
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,577
Rym: But I'm gonna do something crazy.

86
00:04:25,618 --> 00:04:26,543
Rym: I got a geek back.

87
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:31,182
Rym: Oh, no Yeah, we got an email from a guy named Walt from Canada.

88
00:04:31,342 --> 00:04:33,068
Rym: didn't say where in Canada somewhere up there.

89
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:41,203
Rym: Hey You know, I can't really make fun of Canadians because where I grew up in Michigan There wasn't that much of a cultural divide between us.

90
00:04:41,243 --> 00:04:41,705
Rym: and I'm Terry.

91
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:42,970
Scott: I'm not making fun of Canadians.

92
00:04:43,231 --> 00:04:44,619
Scott: I like Canada like Canadians.

93
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,282
Scott: I like hockey.

94
00:04:45,343 --> 00:04:46,670
Scott: I like all sorts of Canadian things.

95
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,562
Scott: It's just they do say hey, they don't say it.

96
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:57,427
Scott: as much as people making fun of them Depends in parts of Ontario they do yeah, but I have met Canadians and they say it it.

97
00:04:57,688 --> 00:04:59,195
Scott: that's what they do It's it's true.

98
00:04:59,818 --> 00:05:03,984
Rym: Honestly, there is only one Accent of English that is ever.

99
00:05:04,065 --> 00:05:04,830
Rym: it doesn't bother me.

100
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,171
Rym: I do like.

101
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:08,022
Rym: I don't think ah that person but I can't help.

102
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:09,990
Rym: but Chuck a little bit and I feel bad about it.

103
00:05:10,392 --> 00:05:15,274
Rym: But I cannot talk to anyone from Minnesota Yeah, anytime.

104
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:17,283
Scott: so it's sort of like talking to Swedish people.

105
00:05:17,544 --> 00:05:18,789
Rym: I don't mind that that doesn't bother me.

106
00:05:19,392 --> 00:05:21,100
Scott: No, it doesn't bother me either one.

107
00:05:21,261 --> 00:05:23,110
Scott: but they both make me laugh because they're so silly.

108
00:05:23,451 --> 00:05:29,533
Rym: The only accent that makes me laugh is a Minnesotan and only if it's like the crazy Stereotypical like.

109
00:05:29,613 --> 00:05:31,643
Rym: I can't believe this person actually talks this way.

110
00:05:31,683 --> 00:05:45,445
Rym: I thought that was only in the movies, Minnesota Yeah, they also say a in Minnesota a. What was that stupid joke that someone told us we were playing D&D at RIT and someone was like, yeah Minnesotans That's what you get when Canadians get lost in the woods something like that.

111
00:05:45,465 --> 00:05:46,851
Rym: Something might have been vice versa I don't know.

112
00:05:46,872 --> 00:05:49,120
Rym: I don't know but I got I'm.

113
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,890
Rym: Well, I'm glad you listen to the show, but I might rip in your email a little bit here.

114
00:05:54,112 --> 00:05:56,249
Scott: Oh, you're gonna tear a listener a new one.

115
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:58,996
Rym: You know, I almost did that Dave and Joel voice.

116
00:05:59,016 --> 00:05:59,699
Rym: I don't even know why.

117
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:02,016

Rym: So hi guys really enjoy the show.

119
00:06:04,591 --> 00:06:19,110
Rym: You're informative in the topic of anime and highly entertaining when you go on tangents and talk about off the topic stuff Then swing back to the topic reminds me myself and my old friend from high school college You do sound like two buds just talking over a soda or a beer.

120
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,555
Rym: I don't know why I suddenly started doing.

121
00:06:20,836 --> 00:06:22,100
Scott: I don't drink soda or beer.

122
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:23,525
Rym: Yeah, I drink.

123
00:06:23,946 --> 00:06:25,170
Rym: I don't really drink soda anymore either.

124
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,214
Rym: I drink soda water.

125
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:30,390
Rym: Anyway, now, uh, here's the part that I'm kind of curious about.

126
00:06:30,952 --> 00:06:35,929
Rym: Hopefully women will not come in and mess this up Huh?

127
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,472
Rym: Parentheses.

128
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,337

131
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:53,649
Scott: get back in the kitchen.

132
00:06:54,392 --> 00:06:57,642
Rym: When my buddy got married our fun came to an end.

133
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,170
Rym: We have seen you needed a semi-colon there, dude.

134
00:07:00,451 --> 00:07:02,621
Rym: We have seen or spoken for eight years.

135
00:07:02,742 --> 00:07:03,425
Rym: Dave and Joe.

136
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:04,228
Rym: That's all one sentence.

137
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:09,325
Rym: God Dave and Joel have a similar conversation style, but you can tell.

138
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:12,826
Rym: now I want to point out that Walt is obviously mixed up.

139
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:13,330
Rym: Dave and Joe.

140
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:16,799
Scott: Yeah, you can tell Dave is Joel and Joel is Dave.

141
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,010
Rym: granted a lot of people originally thought I was Scott and Scott was Rym.

142
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:22,200
Scott: That's why we started doing that thing at the beginning of the show.

143
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,130
Rym: Of course people also thought I was Hispanic.

144
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:27,045
Rym: Yeah, well one person, okay.

145
00:07:27,568 --> 00:07:30,094
Rym: All right God is one long sentence.

146
00:07:30,114 --> 00:07:30,936
Rym: blah blah blah blah.

147
00:07:31,096 --> 00:07:36,590
Rym: You can tell Dave's senses forward slash sharpness have been slightly dulled by marriage.

148
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:38,749
Scott: Well, Joel's married and Dave is not married.

149
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:41,056
Rym: Women will do that to you.

150
00:07:41,498 --> 00:07:44,988
Rym: dame them and their sex as Joel might say.

151
00:07:45,108 --> 00:07:53,001
Rym: now that was Dave But I must admit I too have fallen for the wilds I believe you meant wilds of women and I am now married.

152
00:07:53,502 --> 00:07:56,313
Rym: so guys stay strong and keep on Podcasting.

153
00:07:56,413 --> 00:07:56,995
Rym: all the bells.

154
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:57,658
Rym: all the best.

155
00:07:57,758 --> 00:08:00,288
Rym: What Walt's from somewhere in Canada?

156
00:08:00,328 --> 00:08:04,510
Rym: now up I'm not gonna just come out right and say that was kind of sexist.

157
00:08:04,912 --> 00:08:06,904
Rym: I don't think I need to get into anything like that.

158
00:08:06,964 --> 00:08:07,930
Scott: That was pretty sexist.

159
00:08:09,211 --> 00:08:15,938
Rym: The point I would like to make because I see a lot of people say things like this like ah, yeah Women will screw up your geekery.

160
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:18,730
Rym: They won't let you play your board games and they won't you know.

161
00:08:18,971 --> 00:08:23,228
Rym: A lot of people say things like this and that's really people you worked with at IBM.

162
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:25,275
Rym: God Not all of them just a few of them.

163
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:28,968
Rym: Yeah, but that's really kind of not true at all.

164
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:39,565
Rym: and One I'll note the fact that Emily and I have been dating for like three years and she is just as geeky if not more so than me All the other girls that all our friends date just as geeky.

165
00:08:39,746 --> 00:08:40,589
Rym: no problems there.

166
00:08:41,352 --> 00:08:49,957
Rym: And I think the thing you see where like a girl drags down the guys geekery and makes him kind of lame That's that has nothing to do with gender.

167
00:08:50,017 --> 00:08:53,850
Rym: guys do that to girls just as often as we've seen in our group of friends before.

168
00:08:54,212 --> 00:08:57,191
Scott: Yeah, I've seen plenty of geeky girls, you know They.

169
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:10,159
Scott: they get with some guy who's not so geeky and they never hang out with us and they never do anything cool Even though they're all into the coolness and then as soon as they dump that loser guy They're back hanging out with us doing all sorts geek stuff.

170
00:09:10,721 --> 00:09:21,525
Rym: So essentially now also I'd like to say that David I don't know how you mixed up Dave and Joel because they actually refer to each other by name all the time Which we don't yep, and I don't know.

171
00:09:21,565 --> 00:09:22,650
Rym: I don't really see that either.

172
00:09:23,032 --> 00:09:25,524
Rym: I mean Dave's relationship before.

173
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,980
Rym: I'm not gonna get into that though I think he was a little bit bitter about the breakup.

174
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,169
Rym: if you from the show you could kind of get that.

175
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:33,749
Rym: but This has nothing to do with sex.

176
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:38,710
Rym: It just has to do with people dating people who don't have similar interests and then dealing with it.

177
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:44,850
Scott: It also has to do with people sort of can you know going out with someone for whatever reason and then sort of?

178
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,459
Scott: Controlling them or allowing themselves to be controlled by the other person.

179
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:59,810
Scott: if you marry someone and you like to work on cars Why if if they're demanding that you give up your enjoyment of working on cars to be with them?

180
00:10:00,493 --> 00:10:04,110
Scott: Why do you want to be with this person and do they really?

181
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:09,588
Scott: Love you and respect you if they want you to stop doing the other things you enjoy in order to be.

182
00:10:09,628 --> 00:10:11,469
Scott: what kind of Relationship is that yeah?

183
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,678
Scott: I mean it has nothing to do with men and women.

184
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:23,455
Scott: it could be gay people were one like a gay guy And then a gay guy who's not geeky and they get together and the non geeky gay guy makes the geeky Romantic relationship.

185
00:10:23,515 --> 00:10:25,561
Rym: it could just be friends where it could just be friend.

186
00:10:25,601 --> 00:10:29,010
Rym: friend is really kind of like that god that calm.

187
00:10:31,212 --> 00:10:33,859
Scott: It could be any sort of relationship between people.

188
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:42,650
Scott: you know friends are more than friends or family even where you know you have Kids and then you know because you have kids your kids tell you to stop doing something.

189
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,994
Scott: Then you do it or something like that Your parents.

190
00:10:46,095 --> 00:10:48,484
Scott: you let them tell you what to do and what not to do.

191
00:10:49,026 --> 00:10:49,990
Scott: do what you want.

192
00:10:50,413 --> 00:10:52,729
Scott: Don't let anyone tell you you can't do what you want.

193
00:10:53,393 --> 00:11:03,958
Scott: And if they do tell you to do something other than what you want They obviously don't care about you or they care about you less than you think they do or you need to tell them hey listen This is what I like.

194
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:09,749
Scott: learn to deal with it or else I don't need you, and if you think that somehow a woman or anyone.

195
00:11:10,091 --> 00:11:11,840
Rym: I mean people seem to think we're gay.

196
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,730
Rym: so a guy whatever an alien a furry.

197
00:11:13,871 --> 00:11:17,350
Rym: I don't know if anything could stop the geekery in the front row crew.

198
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:21,446
Rym: I would just like to point out that every girl in the front row crew and gasps.

199
00:11:21,486 --> 00:11:28,410
Rym: There's a lot of them Actually I think almost now they don't quite outnumber now another, but there's still a lot too many penises.

200
00:11:28,832 --> 00:11:36,146
Rym: They're all just as geeky if not more geeky than us without exception And they definitely do the opposite of slowing down the geekery.

201
00:11:36,207 --> 00:11:38,974
Rym: yes for sure Right that's all I got.

202
00:11:39,295 --> 00:11:40,298
Rym: so we're glad you listen.

203
00:11:40,318 --> 00:11:42,886
Rym: That's all cool, but a little sexist there.

204
00:11:43,227 --> 00:11:52,699
Rym: Yeah, you might want to Loosen up, and I will say I often Kind of suspect anyone who's sexist like that of being latently homosexual, but I'm not gonna get into that slide.

205
00:11:54,031 --> 00:11:55,697
Rym: I'm not gonna make an ad hominem or anything.

206
00:11:55,737 --> 00:11:56,018
Rym: I'm not.

207
00:11:56,219 --> 00:11:56,781
Scott: that's all you.

208
00:11:56,961 --> 00:11:58,366
Rym: not that there's anything wrong with that.

209
00:11:58,647 --> 00:11:59,189
Scott: That's all you.

210
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:01,957
Scott: All right, I got a real news now.

211
00:12:01,977 --> 00:12:03,162
Scott: Okay, man.

212
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:03,704
Scott: All right with you.

213
00:12:03,825 --> 00:12:04,708
Scott: Not really all right.

214
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:06,758
Scott: So I'm not gonna.

215
00:12:06,778 --> 00:12:09,250
Scott: the actual news itself is gonna be quick.

216
00:12:09,531 --> 00:12:14,205
Scott: Is that some guy who's a chemist at Cambridge Cambridge is the right way to say it?

217
00:12:14,646 --> 00:12:14,807
Rym: Yeah?

218
00:12:14,847 --> 00:12:14,967
Rym: Yeah?

219
00:12:16,851 --> 00:12:27,110
Scott: He wrote a scientific paper of some sort and he put the old Creative Commons on there As a smart person does and it was published by Oxford University Press.

220
00:12:27,531 --> 00:12:29,679
Rym: Did they follow the terms of the Creative Commons?

221
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:32,830
Scott: like no they blatantly violated the terms of the Creative Commons?

222
00:12:33,471 --> 00:12:39,926
Scott: And they're charging like $48 for a copy of this thing double Oh, he even had to pay $48 to get a copy from them.

223
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:49,596
Scott: also There's a FUD group called the prism coalition that is going around sort of saying that open Scientific documentation is no good.

224
00:12:49,857 --> 00:12:56,113
Scott: it prism stands for the partnership of research integrity in science and medicine and FUD stands for fear Uncertainty and doubt.

225
00:12:56,194 --> 00:12:57,779
Scott: right that's the news.

226
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,645
Scott: someone violated Creative Commons license.

227
00:12:59,685 --> 00:13:07,290
Scott: fuck them, but the actual thing I want to say is this of all the things that people publish in the world don't you think that?

228
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:19,310
Scott: scientific research Done in an academic setting paid for in part or whole by taxpayer dollars Should be freely and publicly available to all.

229
00:13:20,193 --> 00:13:28,568
Scott: Nothing in the world I think makes more sense to be freely and publicly available and not copyrighted or restricted in any way.

230
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:38,549
Scott: then scientific research Which everyone can get the benefit of learning and expanding their knowledge from that they partially or wholly paid for.

231
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:40,520
Rym: yeah I mean, I can't add to that.

232
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:40,801
Rym: I agree 100%.

233
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:46,034
Rym: now We're not saying you know if a private company does private research And they want to.

234
00:13:46,114 --> 00:13:57,849
Scott: yeah, if you're a drug company, and you invent some wonder drug You know patents last X years whatever and you patent it because that you don't copyright things like that you patent it Which means you tell everyone what you did?

235
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,950
Scott: But they're not allowed to do it at least not in a country where the law is enforced.

236
00:14:02,271 --> 00:14:04,141
Scott: That's how patents work and they also.

237
00:14:04,242 --> 00:14:11,190
Scott: if you have some sort of trade secret Then the patent office keeps your patent a secret also, so no one can actually find out until the patents over either.

238
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,770
Rym: Well actually I believe the way that works is you just don't patent it.

239
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,855
Rym: It's just a trade secret.

240
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:15,860
Rym: if someone steals it from you.

241
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,282
Rym: You're fucked.

242
00:14:16,402 --> 00:14:18,050
Scott: it depends on the situation on the lawyer.

243
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:19,026
Rym: It depends on the country.

244
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:24,507
Scott: yes But if someone paid for their own research, and they invent something and they want to keep how it works a secret.

245
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:25,230
Scott: That's fine.

246
00:14:27,391 --> 00:14:33,110
Rym: Because I'm not I can't take a black and white information should be free position on it because it's a complicated issue.

247
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,498
Rym: Yes, even though I do Jen.

248
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:35,081
Scott: I'm not talking.

249
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:35,362
Scott: Yes.

250
00:14:35,463 --> 00:14:36,750
Scott: I'm not taking the greater state.

251
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,825
Scott: I'm not talking about the greater issue here, which I still might say something.

252
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:44,620
Scott: what I'm talking about is When a teacher a professor had a college, what was it?

253
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,904
Rym: a private or public college?

254
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:47,328
Rym: Oh, it was Cambridge.

255
00:14:47,349 --> 00:14:48,857
Rym: That's right Never mind.

256
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,267
Rym: I wasn't listening to you at all.

257
00:14:50,368 --> 00:15:07,702
Scott: no if you write a paper and You're getting paid in some way by tax money Especially if you're getting paid in some way of a tax money And you thought up something new and you want to share it or you should be sharing it with the whole world Shouldn't people be able to read that shit for free.

258
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:09,009
Rym: I mean forget all that.

259
00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:19,963
Rym: even The professor put this out under the Creative Commons, so uh get a lawyer and sue the shit out of that journal You should you should freakin sue the mighty all hell out of Oxford for doing this.

260
00:15:20,405 --> 00:15:21,870
Scott: I would get mad lawyers on them.

261
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:31,042
Rym: So yeah granted unless he licenses under the Creative Commons in Contradiction to previous agreements he may have signed regarding said research.

262
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:31,804
Scott: who knows about that?

263
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:36,878
Rym: because as you know internet Tends too often not do a lot of research.

264
00:15:37,138 --> 00:15:51,142
Scott: yep, but just be warned anything the prism coalition says is probably BS and It really sucks that all scientific most scientific research is published in scientific journals Which are fine except that they're not free.

265
00:15:51,444 --> 00:15:58,130
Scott: they cost a lot of money And if you go to like a college you can read them because the college library buys them or you hope they buy them

266
00:15:58,716 --> 00:15:59,102
Rym: alright, otherwise

267
00:16:00,571 --> 00:16:09,249
Scott: They're not free and a scientific information is Secret even if your tax money paid for it, which it probably did and it sucks balls

268
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:17,558
Rym: things of the day.

269
00:16:18,183 --> 00:16:20,980
Rym: So we've never gone to the Burning Man festival.

270
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:30,900
Rym: I'm not really gonna get into what the Burning Man festival is other than I go one day I'd love to but it's not like a con where you can just like show up for a weekend and then leave.

271
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,715
Rym: It's not the kind of thing where you just kind of go in and look at everything.

272
00:16:33,775 --> 00:16:36,631
Rym: It's uh There are pros and cons to it.

273
00:16:36,712 --> 00:16:38,160
Rym: It's an interesting exercise.

274
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:45,759
Rym: I think a lot of the people who do it make it out to be a lot more than it is But at the same time I think a lot of people don't understand just how much it actually is.

275
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:56,760
Rym: but one thing that is always a staple of Burning Man other than the Burning Man is The amazing crazy art and music and things that people do there just for the ever-living fuck of it.

276
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,956
Scott: Well, you get a bunch of hippies together arts gonna pop out that.

277
00:16:59,996 --> 00:17:06,636
Rym: that's how it works Especially because the crowd that goes to Burning Man tends to be the fairly technological hippies.

278
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:08,280
Rym: They're not anarcho primitivists.

279
00:17:08,742 --> 00:17:10,809
Scott: Well, there's techno hippies in this sort.

280
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,315
Scott: It's also anarcho primitivists.

281
00:17:12,335 --> 00:17:13,599
Scott: There's all time all kind.

282
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,829
Rym: However, it's I think I'm general a lot of the people there.

283
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:22,760
Rym: the impression I get are the kinds who read all the blogs And they all blog about their experience and they really yeah.

284
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,626
Scott: But anyway, there's a lot of hipsters there.

285
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:27,957
Rym: check out these pictures of this art installation.

286
00:17:27,977 --> 00:17:28,880
Rym: That's some hippies made.

287
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,021
Rym: I'm.

288
00:17:30,543 --> 00:17:32,429
Rym: I can't believe they made something this cool.

289
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:33,814
Scott: Well, you got like.

290
00:17:33,954 --> 00:17:34,817
Scott: how long is Burning Man?

291
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:34,958
Scott: like?

292
00:17:34,998 --> 00:17:35,460
Scott: a week or two?

293
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,483
Rym: I don't even know.

294
00:17:36,524 --> 00:17:38,031
Scott: you got a lot of time on your hands.

295
00:17:38,553 --> 00:17:39,719
Scott: You don't have much to do.

296
00:17:40,223 --> 00:17:42,099
Scott: There's a lot of cool people hanging around.

297
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:43,578
Scott: What's gonna happen?

298
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,303
Scott: Making cool stuff?

299
00:17:45,785 --> 00:17:47,491
Rym: just seriously check out these pictures.

300
00:17:47,551 --> 00:17:50,220
Scott: plus a lot of people go in with a plan to make cool stuff.

301
00:17:50,381 --> 00:17:51,667
Scott: So, you know they must.

302
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:52,873
Scott: it's not like they spur.

303
00:17:52,893 --> 00:17:54,160
Scott: the moment came made something awesome.

304
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,370
Scott: They probably planned it out got there and just did the deed.

305
00:17:57,113 --> 00:17:57,475
Scott: Is that it?

306
00:17:57,495 --> 00:17:58,158
Scott: That's it.

307
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:03,174
Scott: All right So this here is a video of two dudes one dude.

308
00:18:03,335 --> 00:18:04,298
Scott: It's playing the violin.

309
00:18:04,358 --> 00:18:10,300
Scott: quite well He's not like the greatest violin player ever, but he's better than me better than I'll ever be probably.

310
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:12,307
Scott: Considering I'm probably never gonna even try.

311
00:18:12,327 --> 00:18:19,346
Scott: I read an article about how hard it is to play the violin and why and yeah I'm never gonna be able to play the violin But he's good at playing the violin.

312
00:18:19,827 --> 00:18:36,489
Scott: and behind him you have a guy who is rocking the two turntables and he is okay Using his two turntables spit making some beat beats of various kinds that are enjoyable and these two men combine their music in a fashion, which is most pleasing to the ear of Scott.

313
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:44,864
Scott: it Reminds me many times of say a samurai Champloo soundtrack having sex with the noir soundtrack Maybe.

314
00:18:44,884 --> 00:18:46,800
Rym: ah, it is quite hot.

315
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:58,026
Scott: I must say this is the kind of music that I want to listen to but it's also the kind of music that Is only available from two guys on YouTube in one video, did you even do any research?

316
00:18:58,066 --> 00:18:59,350
Rym: maybe that cuz they have a website.

317
00:18:59,812 --> 00:19:01,357
Scott: Maybe I did not do research.

318
00:19:01,538 --> 00:19:04,730
Rym: So you didn't look at for all, you know, they have CDs in the stars.

319
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:10,430
Scott: Maybe they do and if they do I might buy it for the first time in how many years I might buy a CD?

320
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,355
Rym: I have to agree.

321
00:19:11,395 --> 00:19:13,287
Rym: I mean, this is pretty amazing.

322
00:19:13,388 --> 00:19:26,314
Scott: I Generally like things like this anyway, but got that anyone who says again that you know the record companies They're sucking because of this that and the other thing they're sucking because this is not the music that they are making and this is The music that I want.

323
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:31,688
Scott: and if they made all their music as cool as this I would be mighty broke mighty broke.

324
00:19:32,494 --> 00:19:42,336
Rym: So in the grand scheme of life There are a lot of different ways you can compete with your fellow human beings for fame and glory and pure Dominance over one another like boxing.

325
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:51,911
Rym: Yeah boxing or sports or board or anything like that tickle fights baseball Oratory podcasting podcasting.

326
00:19:52,472 --> 00:20:07,090
Rym: but there's one that is near and dear to both myself and Scott independently of one another and the fact that we came together and Have had epic epic battles in this arena as made us realize that we really need to do a show about air hockey.

327
00:20:07,534 --> 00:20:17,769
Scott: Well, I was arguing previously that perhaps air hockey should be a Tuesday show because it is sort of a game and it is mostly played in the video arcades Even though it is not a video game.

328
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:24,710
Rym: However, as you might well know Scott has been saying lately that it is video game season and I looked at the GeekNights calendar.

329
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:29,153
Rym: We have Tuesday shows booked for like the next two months So we'll just.

330
00:20:29,534 --> 00:20:32,523
Scott: I guess I do consider air hockey a sport as well as a game.

331
00:20:33,105 --> 00:20:34,529
Scott: So we'll throw it on Thursday.

332
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:37,542
Scott: cuz Sports that that doesn't fit into any other days.

333
00:20:37,622 --> 00:20:37,843
Scott: Sure.

334
00:20:37,984 --> 00:20:39,030
Scott: Why not now?

335
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:41,563
Rym: I don't think there's anyone out there who is unaware.

336
00:20:41,603 --> 00:20:46,370
Scott: but very briefly You know, I don't know do they have air hockey in other countries?

337
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:49,224
Scott: It was I mean air hockey was invented in the u.s.

338
00:20:49,345 --> 00:20:49,827
Scott: In like the 70s.

339
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,610
Scott: So it's you know, I really not sure how much it spread to around the world.

340
00:20:55,011 --> 00:20:59,910
Rym: Yeah, it also doesn't help that the majority of air hockey tables out there are really shitty, but we'll get into that.

341
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:00,713
Scott: Yeah, we will.

342
00:21:01,034 --> 00:21:05,027
Rym: so air hockey is a sport where it's kind of like a basement parlor sport.

343
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:05,830
Rym: You got a big table.

344
00:21:06,392 --> 00:21:14,590
Rym: It's like about the size of a pool table billiards if you have a real air hockey table Yeah, and it's flat and it's polished and there are a million little holes in the surface.

345
00:21:15,094 --> 00:21:19,600
Scott: There's a motor that generates air Air compressor which attached to a motor.

346
00:21:19,982 --> 00:21:24,762
Rym: it pushes air out of all of these holes evenly Hopefully if it's a good table, so air is coming out of the top.

347
00:21:25,405 --> 00:21:26,510
Rym: two sides have goals.

348
00:21:26,991 --> 00:21:27,734
Rym: I have two people.

349
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:29,680
Rym: each have a paddle that you put down.

350
00:21:29,761 --> 00:21:32,550
Rym: kind of looks like according to Wikipedia a sombrero.

351
00:21:32,934 --> 00:21:34,450
Scott: It does kind of look like a sombrero.

352
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:41,930
Rym: However, I just got to say that the Wikipedia article links to the article on sombreros And I've edited a lot for Wikipedia in the past.

353
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:47,470
Rym: But that is the saddest article I've ever seen and that is the saddest picture of a sombrero.

354
00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:49,477
Rym: I think the sombrero article be bigger.

355
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:56,085
Scott: talking about the origin of the sombrero and you know where it came from Maybe some famous people who wore sombreros just so sad.

356
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:59,839
Rym: sombreros gained Popularity and that picture is just so.

357
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:00,763
Rym: I weep for it.

358
00:22:00,843 --> 00:22:02,410
Rym: I feel like that sombrero was crying.

359
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,276
Scott: It's like the long-lost Wikipedia article.

360
00:22:04,336 --> 00:22:07,666
Scott: someone please research sombreros and fill the article in.

361
00:22:07,686 --> 00:22:08,810
Scott: I feel bad for it.

362
00:22:09,112 --> 00:22:18,609
Rym: Yeah, they got like a bird without a wing-a-ling But anyway, so the object you have a little puck that floats on the air So it is effectively almost friction-free.

363
00:22:19,312 --> 00:22:31,850
Rym: It's a lot like an ice hockey puck on ice only it's a plastic disc on air And your goal is through sheer force of manliness or womanliness because I've known some women who are really super good at this game.

364
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,618
Rym: And it's not like the game is.

365
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,846
Scott: it can't favor him is like his geek back Not that guy.

366
00:22:37,907 --> 00:22:44,830
Rym: No But it's awesome and I love it and it's one of my favorite sport slash games in the world.

367
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:49,570
Scott: Yeah, you have a plastics disc and you're whacking it back and forth and it has almost no friction.

368
00:22:49,670 --> 00:23:01,029
Scott: So it goes really fast and the other person is trying to hit it back at you and you're hitting a piece of plastic back And forth ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha and you're trying to get it in a goal and that it's pretty cool right there.

369
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:04,569
Rym: Now I've been super into air hockey since I was a little kid.

370
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:20,821
Scott: Well when I was a little kid even before air hockey we had knock hockey Which you basically have this wooden board with a wooden puck and a little tiny red hockey stick And you sort of sit on one side and your friend sits on the other side And you take turns hitting the wooden puck back and forth.

371
00:23:20,922 --> 00:23:28,392
Scott: it usually devolved into hitting your friend Sometimes but me and my friends we actually sort of played knock hockey pretty seriously Like.

372
00:23:28,412 --> 00:23:31,342
Scott: we even had the the real boards that had little nets behind them.

373
00:23:31,402 --> 00:23:37,489
Scott: so air hockey was just sort of a Grown-up version of knock hockey in a way so bad.

374
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:41,150
Rym: You know when I was a kid arcades kind of still existed and weren't so bad yet.

375
00:23:41,491 --> 00:23:45,290
Rym: So I went to the arcade a lot and there was a really good air hockey table there.

376
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,843
Scott: So I played it whenever I went to an arcade as a kid.

377
00:23:47,923 --> 00:23:49,270
Scott: They always had air hockey.

378
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,274
Scott: It was just a staple.

379
00:23:50,435 --> 00:23:55,996
Rym: every single arcade had it no matter what and I played it so much that one time for Christmas my Parents got us an air hockey table.

380
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,362
Scott: I never actually got.

381
00:23:57,422 --> 00:23:59,912
Rym: it wasn't a good air hockey table But it was bad.

382
00:23:59,932 --> 00:24:06,797
Rym: I mean it was better than nothing and I played it every day every single day for God like eight or nine years straight.

383
00:24:07,158 --> 00:24:10,890
Scott: Yeah, you can get air hockey tables really cheaply like for a few hundred bucks.

384
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:17,218
Scott: They also you know they double as other things like little miniature pool tables and things But they're always small and crappy.

385
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:27,529
Scott: it really the eight-foot full-size Real-deal air hockey tables are the only thing that really count and everything else is sort of crap and doesn't work.

386
00:24:28,394 --> 00:24:30,387
Rym: So in way as a kid in middle school.

387
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:37,230
Rym: in high school This is my sad story of Rym learned a lesson and grew up and he became an adult and learned about the real world.

388
00:24:37,731 --> 00:24:41,503
Rym: So I played air hockey a lot, and I'm not gonna like be humble about this.

389
00:24:41,543 --> 00:24:45,878
Rym: I was super freakin good at air hockey and Up until college.

390
00:24:45,979 --> 00:24:49,978
Rym: I was absolutely undefeated And I played against people in the arcade.

391
00:24:50,018 --> 00:24:55,369
Rym: I played against my brother against my family people who cared about the game Little mini ad hoc tournaments we'd set up.

392
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,010
Rym: No one could beat me.

393
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:04,027
Rym: I just I think part of it was that I was probably the only kid in the entirety of the state who actually Practiced air hockey.

394
00:25:04,148 --> 00:25:05,173
Scott: well I mean you think about it.

395
00:25:05,193 --> 00:25:08,967
Scott: air hockey is not something that a great number of people think or care about.

396
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:20,057
Scott: so if you Spend it You know just a minimal amount of time Trying to practice it or you know think about it on any deeper level you're gonna beat the vast majority of people at air Hockey.

397
00:25:20,241 --> 00:25:21,795
Rym: yep That's one thing we learn.

398
00:25:21,835 --> 00:25:28,224
Scott: later is Scott and I both like imagine if there was a fighting game And you were the only person who actually learned all the moves.

399
00:25:28,324 --> 00:25:35,690
Scott: even if you sucked at it You'd probably win a lot beating the vast majority of people in the world just because no one else has bothered to look at it.

400
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:41,490
Rym: Yep, I mean if two people who've never played air hockey before play the outcome is almost entirely random.

401
00:25:42,192 --> 00:25:46,505
Rym: But it's I mean if one of those people is even played air hockey a few more times.

402
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:56,887
Rym: They're probably win yep But you know super undefeated, and I remember I went to RIT and one time the topic of air hockey came up And I was like yeah, I'm super fucking good seriously, and I was.

403
00:25:56,907 --> 00:25:57,510
Rym: we played a bunch.

404
00:25:57,611 --> 00:26:01,795
Rym: I still remained undefeated for a little while and then Our friend Luke one day.

405
00:26:01,816 --> 00:26:02,820
Rym: You know it came up.

406
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,880
Rym: I'm in his presence, and he was like oh well I'm super good at air hockey too.

407
00:26:07,403 --> 00:26:16,708
Rym: now at this point I know that I'd never really played outside of my environment And I'd never played against a skilled person like someone who had also cared about air hockey as much as I did

408
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:18,619
Scott: or at least a little bit yeah

409
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,997
Rym: a little bit and He absolutely smoked me.

410
00:26:23,017 --> 00:26:24,222
Rym: I was crushed.

411
00:26:24,262 --> 00:26:26,030
Rym: my undefeated record was gone forever.

412
00:26:26,131 --> 00:26:27,219
Rym: I felt like a dumbass.

413
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:35,228
Scott: well because see what he did is It's pretty much you go through your whole life playing a game against people who don't even think about the game at all and you Think about it a little bit.

414
00:26:35,731 --> 00:26:41,990
Scott: So you play against someone who thinks about it a little bit also and Luke's basic idea was that he would defend.

415
00:26:42,492 --> 00:26:46,450
Scott: He just defended no matter what he put his full concentration on defense.

416
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:47,669
Scott: He actually cared about it.

417
00:26:47,931 --> 00:27:02,130
Scott: He thought about defending he concentrated on defending and he never let you score and then when he got the puck Sometimes he would hit it really hard in the same way every time and maybe a slightly different way And he would go in after you know an amount of time.

418
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:06,365
Scott: He would just endure until he got all the goals and he would defend no matter what.

419
00:27:06,726 --> 00:27:07,830
Scott: so it was really hard to score.

420
00:27:08,112 --> 00:27:15,770
Rym: It was even worse than that because his defense He'd basically sit there defending hoping that you get frustrated and start scoring on yourself, which often happens.

421
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,977
Scott: Yeah, I still score on myself.

422
00:27:18,238 --> 00:27:19,903
Rym: Yeah, but that was it.

423
00:27:20,084 --> 00:27:28,324
Rym: I realized that wait a minute crap there are other people who are also good at this game and I started practicing and playing a lot and then Scott also got into it.

424
00:27:28,344 --> 00:27:31,717
Rym: the two of us played against each other Pretty much at every opportunity.

425
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:35,390
Scott: Yeah, if there's a real air hockey table, we will play it like nuts.

426
00:27:35,872 --> 00:27:38,909
Scott: However, if there is no real air hockey table, we don't play it.

427
00:27:39,312 --> 00:27:42,350
Rym: So it's gotten to the point now where I know there are people out there.

428
00:27:42,752 --> 00:27:49,111
Scott: I pray and I'm sure there are people out there who are better at air high possibly this list of air hockey Champions, they might be better than you I think.

429
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:56,459
Rym: but I would say of the all the people in the world who have ever played air hockey or ever will play air Hockey, I think we're in the top 1%.

430
00:27:56,459 --> 00:27:59,750
Scott: what happens if suddenly there's a huge burst in air hockey popularity?

431
00:27:59,892 --> 00:28:04,050
Scott: It would be fucking awesome I know but then we wouldn't be anywhere close to the top 1%.

432
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:14,149
Rym: No Cuz if there was a sudden boom we have a head start and you can guarantee we'd be practicing every single day and join in All the time, yeah, but the problem with that is it's sort of like baseball where baseball is a solved sport.

433
00:28:14,189 --> 00:28:22,584
Scott: now We're back in the day when it was new and on and sort of you know Yeah I'll totally solvable and it'll come down to just pure reaction times and math.

434
00:28:22,624 --> 00:28:28,345
Scott: and but air hockey is currently unsolved I I think and it's it's very so it's it doesn't?

435
00:28:28,385 --> 00:28:36,698
Scott: they've made a lot of progress but it's still unsolved and people haven't you know put the full effort of human ingenuity into figuring out the Absolute best possible air hockey.

436
00:28:36,738 --> 00:28:39,390
Rym: probably because most human beings don't give a rat's ass.

437
00:28:40,271 --> 00:28:53,169
Scott: but if air hockey becomes suddenly populated popular the game will be solved and it I imagine that many people currently good at air hockey will be left behind by the newcomers playing in their new fancy way.

438
00:28:53,712 --> 00:29:02,630
Rym: but now Scott and I are in kind of a predicament because we play against each other all the time and To be honest, we don't know a single human being who can even come close to beating either.

439
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:02,871
Rym: Yeah, I

440
00:29:02,911 --> 00:29:08,057
Scott: don't personally know anyone but I imagine that these people on this list of champions But one

441
00:29:08,117 --> 00:29:16,875
Rym: if you listen to our show and you're out there I'll say right now if if you are ever in our presence and there is an air hockey table within a reasonable distance We'll play against you.

442
00:29:16,915 --> 00:29:17,477
Rym: No question.

443
00:29:17,517 --> 00:29:19,344
Rym: We'll even pay cuz good guy.

444
00:29:19,364 --> 00:29:20,388
Scott: It's a dollar big deal.

445
00:29:20,469 --> 00:29:25,050
Rym: at most It's a dollar but it said because none of our friends will play with us.

446
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:31,720
Rym: so I can only play air hockey if Scott's there and he can only play air hockey if I'm there because No one else will even consider playing with this.

447
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,507
Rym: in fact, they actively avoid playing with us.

448
00:29:33,527 --> 00:29:34,519
Rym: that totally sucks All.

449
00:29:34,561 --> 00:29:37,381
Scott: right now let's let's talk about air hockey the game itself for a second.

450
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:48,348
Scott: in the 70s some guy made a game where there's like a table and there were two mallets and there was a disc and you hit it back and forth or whatever and it was like a low friction surface and something like that.

451
00:29:48,368 --> 00:29:49,754
Scott: and Basically from

452
00:29:49,814 --> 00:29:50,558
Rym: that spawned

453
00:29:50,658 --> 00:30:18,150
Scott: air hockey which is created by Brunswick Which is a company that makes you know pool tables and stuff like that and to this day Valley dynamo slash which is I guess is a division of Brunswick, I think right it's still the same company that invented the game is the only company that makes air hockey tables that are worth a damn and They're the only cut the only air hockey tables that are like, you know approved for you know, real tournament play that counts.

454
00:30:18,414 --> 00:30:23,965
Rym: I mean, I'll be honest I generally just will not play on a table that is not made by them because it's not worth it.

455
00:30:24,186 --> 00:30:33,830
Scott: when you see their tables And you go, oh that's a table that counts and you look at all the other tables around you go Oh, yeah, I guess that is the only table that counts and it makes perfect sense.

456
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:41,790
Scott: I mean They make perfectly rectangular tables that are flat that have even air where there's no gimmicks or anything on the table.

457
00:30:42,093 --> 00:30:43,650
Scott: There's no distracting colors.

458
00:30:44,212 --> 00:30:46,479
Scott: The pucks are uniform and they actually work.

459
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,184
Scott: the goals actually work.

460
00:30:48,444 --> 00:30:52,980
Scott: the the puck things actually, you know, it's Everything about them is standard and perfect.

461
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,789
Rym: The puck is the right size and shape.

462
00:30:55,631 --> 00:30:56,012
Scott: They're great.

463
00:30:56,654 --> 00:31:04,019
Scott: So if you see an air hockey table that says photon or pro style or Something like that, then it counts.

464
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:15,850
Scott: if you see a table that says hot flash to Hot flash to sort of counts because hot flash is also a table They make that is in the same style as the other tables and it's the same.

465
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:20,129
Scott: It's the right shape and size and everything, but it's all covered in neon lights and shit.

466
00:31:20,591 --> 00:31:23,384
Scott: So those neon lights are sort of distracting.

467
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:24,710
Scott: so the table doesn't really count.

468
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:28,043
Rym: So playing air hockey itself because we really get into it.

469
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:29,790
Rym: I kind of almost look at it.

470
00:31:29,911 --> 00:31:43,113
Rym: I'm not gonna say like I'm not being serious here But it's kind of like a martial art in that every time you run a foul of someone who actually cares about the game People all kind of have different styles of play and different grips and different techniques and different shots.

471
00:31:43,173 --> 00:31:46,202
Rym: like Scott has this one kind of shot and I have this one or two.

472
00:31:46,262 --> 00:31:47,988
Rym: like it's my special move.

473
00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:52,965
Rym: and like Like if I'm playing against someone who sucks, it's like I'm gonna score now.

474
00:31:53,547 --> 00:31:54,550
Rym: and Scott is the same thing.

475
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:55,277
Rym: He does this one thing.

476
00:31:55,297 --> 00:32:00,303
Scott: when I'm playing against people who suck All I do is hit the puck straight at the goal every time.

477
00:32:00,343 --> 00:32:06,330
Scott: because think about when most people play air hockey They just try to hit the puck at you not really trying to aim or not knowing how to aim.

478
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:09,665
Scott: So very often they'll hit the puck in a way that doesn't go.

479
00:32:09,805 --> 00:32:12,829
Scott: that wouldn't go in the goal Even if you just had your hands in the air.

480
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:21,950
Rym: That's the reason I lost my first game ever to Luke because I had never played against someone who could shoot worth of shit And I never defended because the puck never even hit my goal.

481
00:32:22,331 --> 00:32:38,070
Scott: So all I do and I play against someone who sucks is aim at the goal every time and the pucks coming at the goal and they have to defend defend defend defend defend defend constantly and Even if they can do it successfully, they probably can't do it for a very long time, but it's gonna go in.

482
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:48,150
Rym: Yep, the other thing I do against people who can't play very well is I just I hit it Absolutely as hard as I can and as fast as I can every time and it just totally throws them off and they freak out

483
00:32:48,912 --> 00:32:51,481
Scott: As long as you don't mess up and accidentally get it in your own goal.

484
00:32:51,502 --> 00:33:02,600
Scott: because that's the only reason that I don't always Hit it as hard as I can because sometimes you know it the way the angles work out it ends up in my own goal Which yeah, well, that's why for the last two years.

485
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,450
Rym: I've been a little bit above Scott in terms of wins.

486
00:33:05,631 --> 00:33:07,018
Rym: I've been I've won every set of games.

487
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:09,028
Scott: We've played not every set again.

488
00:33:09,068 --> 00:33:12,259
Rym: Yeah In the very least you can't deny that it.

489
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:12,741
Rym: while would.

490
00:33:12,781 --> 00:33:18,749
Rym: this year I beat you Quite a few more times than you beat me a handful of more times.

491
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,179
Rym: Maybe I beat you eight times.

492
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,564
Scott: I don't think it was eight.

493
00:33:23,604 --> 00:33:25,290
Rym: you beat me three times.

494
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:29,654
Rym: I think it was more than that and all the times you beat me were tied game And then you won by one.

495
00:33:30,196 --> 00:33:31,502
Scott: all the times you beat me were tied game.

496
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:31,904
Scott: who know?

497
00:33:32,064 --> 00:33:34,736
Rym: two of the games I won by two Whatever.

498
00:33:34,858 --> 00:33:35,688
Scott: It's pretty close.

499
00:33:36,771 --> 00:33:39,561
Scott: Stop acting like you're something, you know way better or anything.

500
00:33:39,902 --> 00:33:40,585
Rym: I think I am.

501
00:33:40,645 --> 00:33:41,950
Scott: No, I don't think you are fine.

502
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:42,693
Rym: That's a challenge.

503
00:33:42,733 --> 00:33:45,222
Rym: We should next next time we find an air hockey table.

504
00:33:45,242 --> 00:33:47,470
Rym: Let's film our match and we'll see we will.

505
00:33:47,631 --> 00:33:49,598
Scott: Yeah, yeah, you'll get a camera.

506
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,325
Rym: In fact, I'm willing to put money on it.

507
00:33:51,987 --> 00:33:52,670
Scott: I'll pay some money.

508
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:57,070
Rym: Maybe I'll put a hundred bucks up on our next two out of three game of air hockey on a professional table.

509
00:33:57,311 --> 00:33:57,995
Scott: We'll see about it.

510
00:33:58,256 --> 00:33:59,543
Rym: Oh, you're not taking the challenge.

511
00:33:59,564 --> 00:34:00,730
Scott: I just I'm not a betting person.

512
00:34:01,031 --> 00:34:03,082
Rym: Oh, so you're not confident your ability to win.

513
00:34:03,142 --> 00:34:04,690
Scott: No, yeah, I just don't bet on things.

514
00:34:07,052 --> 00:34:11,929
Scott: If I was as to be a hundred percent sure thing for me to bet on oh so it's not a hundred percent sure thing.

515
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,638
Scott: No, it's just ninety nine point nine percent sure.

516
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:14,542
Scott: Uh-huh.

517
00:34:14,822 --> 00:34:16,429
Rym: Yeah, I'm willing to put up a hundred bucks.

518
00:34:16,896 --> 00:34:17,789
Scott: I'm not a betting person.

519
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:18,371
Scott: You know that.

520
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:23,708
Scott: and just because someone refuses to bet on something isn't some sort of evidence that I know what?

521
00:34:23,788 --> 00:34:28,143
Rym: I'll put a hundred Bucks up if you beat me, I'll give you a hundred bucks if I beat you.

522
00:34:28,164 --> 00:34:28,927
Rym: You don't owe me shit.

523
00:34:29,128 --> 00:34:29,995
Scott: That's fine We'll do that.

524
00:34:30,014 --> 00:34:32,313
Scott: I Could do that.

525
00:34:32,393 --> 00:34:38,658
Rym: Sure, but against a skilled player you can't do that because they If you shoot at their goal, they just block it.

526
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,063
Rym: you have to be subtle about.

527
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:41,909
Rym: you know fast slow fast slow twiddle it up.

528
00:34:42,411 --> 00:34:45,702
Rym: You make two shots that are kind of part of a three-shot combo

529
00:34:45,742 --> 00:34:45,943
Scott: where

530
00:34:46,264 --> 00:34:56,195
Rym: the first two missed their goal on purpose But bounced back to you in such a way that when it bounces back at the right angle you then hit it and the banking Shots gonna go in and

531
00:34:56,215 --> 00:34:59,730
Scott: you can also like add power to pucks that you know, you hit it really hard.

532
00:35:00,091 --> 00:35:01,599
Scott: It bounces around it comes back.

533
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,588
Scott: It's going slower than when you hit it.

534
00:35:04,212 --> 00:35:12,408
Scott: But if you hit it again now it's going faster than your original hit and you can get the puck going pretty fast if by hitting it a whole lot

535
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:22,990
Rym: and Much like ping-pong but to a much less degree you can put in English on the puck But thinking that that will have a significant effect on your game is not going to get you very far.

536
00:35:23,051 --> 00:35:24,509
Scott: No, I mean it has a slight effect.

537
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:30,650
Scott: But because there's so little friction between the puck and the table whether the puck is spinning or not barely affects how it moves.

538
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:35,810
Scott: It does slightly affect how it might bounce off the wall because that's when it's actually gonna hit something.

539
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,950
Scott: But usually when it hits the wall, it sort of stops spinning.

540
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:50,170
Rym: Yeah a much better strategy if you're playing against someone who's good but doesn't know a lot about air hockey is to Act like you're putting English on it and talk about how you're putting English on it and they'll totally just freak out and lose.

541
00:35:50,492 --> 00:35:59,510
Scott: Yeah, so according to Wikipedia Someone apparently wrote in all sorts of air hockey strategies and things which I must admit these are things I do not do.

542
00:35:59,851 --> 00:36:04,590
Scott: They show like some grips for the puck for the for the paddle that I do not personally use.

543
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,649
Scott: I just sort of grip it like it's you know in my fist.

544
00:36:08,914 --> 00:36:16,418
Rym: So I'm 50/50 on those because on one hand because I use the same grip Scott does though I think I hold my hand up a little higher Kind of like a claw coming down.

545
00:36:16,498 --> 00:36:18,366
Scott: Yeah, something like that dragons claw.

546
00:36:18,587 --> 00:36:28,109
Rym: Yeah, I Used to try all these other ways of holding it like with the fist out Like I tried some defensive offensive things and eventually I realized that they were all shit compared to one of them.

547
00:36:28,453 --> 00:36:29,409
Rym: Yep, but it's got me.

548
00:36:29,631 --> 00:36:36,304
Rym: I'm 50/50 because on one hand that might just be Wikipedia BS or People who are too into air hockey just kind of over analyzing it.

549
00:36:36,746 --> 00:36:39,410
Rym: but at the same time There's the same thing in table tennis.

550
00:36:39,591 --> 00:36:44,970
Rym: I used to play a lot of table tennis and I actually switched to a Chinese grip and it was far superior.

551
00:36:45,711 --> 00:36:46,494
Scott: Yeah, it's just.

552
00:36:46,534 --> 00:36:55,310
Scott: you know, I I've never actually played in tournaments or with professionals, you know I'm basically like it's sort of like being the best person in your town to pick up basketball.

553
00:36:55,712 --> 00:36:57,301
Scott: You don't have NBA skills.

554
00:36:57,482 --> 00:36:59,010
Scott: You're not even close to NBA skills.

555
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,710
Scott: You don't know anything about real basketball.

556
00:37:01,114 --> 00:37:02,810
Scott: But you're better than everyone, you know.

557
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:06,810
Scott: And you're better than everyone in your town because they're just a bunch of schmucks who'd also don't know about NBA basketball.

558
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:17,630
Scott: So this stuff on Wikipedia that says air hockey strategy, I imagine someone who's actually practiced professional You know quote professional air hockey because even professional air hockey is amateur.

559
00:37:18,231 --> 00:37:23,962
Scott: I'd probably lose but I'm also considering practicing these things so that maybe I won't lose.

560
00:37:28,517 --> 00:37:29,390
Scott: You don't have a basement.

561
00:37:29,682 --> 00:37:41,252
Rym: I mean I almost would put it in the living room because I'd be okay with that being in the way and the only reason I decided Well, we decided not to was just that we can't even play DDR in there because the floor is not supported So well.

562
00:37:41,352 --> 00:37:45,890
Scott: an air hockey table is a big eight foot long by like four or five foot long table.

563
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,575
Scott: It's big as a motor in it.

564
00:37:47,655 --> 00:37:48,879
Scott: It's heavy as all hell.

565
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:49,862
Scott: It's huge.

566
00:37:49,922 --> 00:37:50,805
Rym: I mean space wise.

567
00:37:51,226 --> 00:37:52,650
Scott: I would turn a loud motor.

568
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:58,050
Rym: I would totally consider putting it like in that space behind the piano like in piano, but I could put it there.

569
00:37:58,211 --> 00:37:59,820
Rym: But I'm afraid it would make the floor sag.

570
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,710
Scott: I'm afraid it would fall through the floor eventually.

571
00:38:02,412 --> 00:38:09,355
Rym: Also the fact that I don't think anyone would appreciate tech tech tech tech tech tech tech tech tech tech tech tech tech tech tech tech Tech tech tech tech.

572
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:11,350
Rym: four hours a day every single goddamn day.

573
00:38:11,451 --> 00:38:12,930
Scott: No, I don't think they'd appreciate that either.

574
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:18,470
Scott: But if I owned a house with a basement I would go immediately to Valley Dynamo.

575
00:38:19,031 --> 00:38:26,560
Scott: the only makers of worthwhile air hockey tables and purchase an air hockey table are pretty much immediately.

576
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:31,314
Rym: I Guess the moral of this is just if you have never played air hockey.

577
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:32,900
Rym: It's a great sport.

578
00:38:33,161 --> 00:38:34,687
Rym: It's really really fun.

579
00:38:34,928 --> 00:38:36,574
Rym: You don't need to be super athletic or anything.

580
00:38:36,594 --> 00:38:38,040
Rym: You just need good eye hand coordination.

581
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,026
Rym: You got to be quick.

582
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,480
Scott: You gotta use your hands in your arm and your wrist.

583
00:38:41,721 --> 00:38:45,080
Rym: Yep, you see you probably got to be able to stand up or something to that effect.

584
00:38:45,321 --> 00:38:47,570
Scott: Yeah, it really sucks cuz it's it's.

585
00:38:48,072 --> 00:38:50,240
Scott: it should be a handicap accessible game.

586
00:38:50,301 --> 00:38:54,820
Scott: It's a game where you just sort of use your arms But you got to be able to reach sort of deep into the table.

587
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,900
Scott: So I guess they'd need some sort of chair to like sit them up or something.

588
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:06,089
Rym: I also kind of rock back and forth and get up on my toes a lot and kind of shift my weight around and I can't say exactly when or why but I do that a lot.

589
00:39:06,289 --> 00:39:13,460
Scott: Yeah, sometimes I lean down just because the tables eight feet long So you need to be able to reach four feet out into the table on occasion.

590
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:18,880
Rym: Well, plus really to be good You need to be able to lean back and lean forward and change your angle and view depending on what's going on.

591
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:29,400
Rym: I mean if you're really on the offensive you kind of want to lean forward and get like the Momentum in the offensive, but if you're on the defensive you want to lay back and stay low so you can see everything more clearly.

592
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,785
Rym: Mmm, yeah stuff like that.

593
00:39:31,805 --> 00:39:37,440
Rym: We take this game way too seriously possibly, but yeah, well, I remember it's sort of like taking skee-ball seriously.

594
00:39:38,261 --> 00:39:40,792
Scott: Yeah, only versus if those versus skee-ball.

595
00:39:40,932 --> 00:39:49,840
Rym: It's kind of like that fascination game Sort of sort of yeah, but if any of you ever want to play air hockey against us, we're totally up for it.

596
00:39:50,081 --> 00:39:51,780
Scott: Yep, air hockey is awesome.

597
00:39:52,362 --> 00:39:53,687
Scott: Everyone should play air hockey.

598
00:39:54,149 --> 00:39:54,571
Scott: It's still.

599
00:39:54,611 --> 00:39:56,880
Scott: it's one of the few things you'll still find in every arcade.

600
00:39:57,384 --> 00:40:01,626
Scott: So if you see an air hockey, you should play it especially if it's made by Valley Dynamo.

601
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:06,749
Scott: also don't play air hockey's that are not made by Valley Dynamo because they'll just ruin you because they're not right.

602
00:40:07,317 --> 00:40:19,940
Rym: and Remember the if for no other reason the reason you want to play air hockey is that in your town if you practice at all You'll be better than everyone in your town and you can just declare yourself the almighty air hockey god of your town.

603
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:22,880
Rym: No one will be able to beat you and you can hustle everyone.

604
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:24,282
Rym: You know what?

605
00:40:24,683 --> 00:40:27,711

606
00:40:27,731 --> 00:40:28,774
Rym: I can't.

607
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:35,535
Rym: I can't hustle because but Some people call me egotistical maybe arrogant big-headed sometimes.

608
00:40:36,057 --> 00:40:46,979
Rym: I don't know why But any time I think like oh I could totally hustle this dude I start to try to make myself lose and then suddenly I think what the fuck I can't lose to this guy and then I win.

609
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,844
Rym: Haha, I just can't do it All right.
