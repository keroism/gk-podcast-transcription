1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,898
Rym: It's Wednesday, October 5th, 2016.

2
00:00:10,898 --> 00:00:11,561
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,831 --> 00:00:15,830
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:18,018
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:18,058 --> 00:00:23,071
Rym: Tonight, we're talking about Mob Psycho 100.

6
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:24,089
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,023 --> 00:00:28,058
Rym: So I'm coming home today.

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:34,440
Rym: And first, as I'm going down to get on the 7 train, there's a lot of yelling going on down there.

9
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:35,473
Rym: Like I hear...

10
00:00:35,822 --> 00:00:36,579
Scott: On your way to work?

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,731
Rym: On the way home from work.

12
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:38,379
Rym: Just now.

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,699
Scott: That makes more sense.

14
00:00:39,963 --> 00:00:41,236
Rym: I hear people yelling.

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,077
Rym: And it was the, like, "Ah, ah, ah," kind of like, "Something's going on down there

16
00:00:46,137 --> 00:00:46,438
Rym: trouble.".

17
00:00:47,062 --> 00:00:49,760
Rym: And all the New Yorkers are kind of, like, crocking the heads.

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,160
Rym: They're going down the stairs, like, ready to just turn around and walk back up those stairs.

19
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,638
Scott: But maybe there's a spectacle to look at.

20
00:00:55,142 --> 00:00:56,659
Rym: It's a bunch of drunk guys in Mets jerseys.

21
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:57,459
Scott: All right.

22
00:00:57,941 --> 00:00:58,312
Rym: So then...

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,177
Scott: It's a little early.

24
00:00:59,721 --> 00:01:00,419
Scott: Yeah, it's super crowded.

25
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,759
Scott: The game's not for a couple hours.

26
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:12,939
Rym: So meanwhile, also, on that ramp that goes down toward the 7 from the 4-5, there's usually the people selling various foods that I would never buy, because those things are probably just full of hepatitis.

27
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:17,960
Rym: But there's also all the people selling bootleg DVDs and bootleg Blu-rays.

28
00:01:18,403 --> 00:01:19,319
Rym: They were all gone today.

29
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,660
Rym: Instead, there were two different people selling bootleg Mets jerseys.

30
00:01:24,342 --> 00:01:25,179
Scott: Hey, not a bad deal.

31
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:25,571
Scott: Yeah.

32
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,680
Scott: Depending on the construction.

33
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:37,578
Rym: And the one guy who is obviously a hobo is holding up these obviously bootleg Mets jerseys, and he's like, "Listen, if they win the World Series, they're going to really wish you bought this from me, you sons of

34
00:01:37,638 --> 00:01:37,840
Rym: bitches.".

35
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:39,900
Rym: And that's his schwiel.

36
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,539
Rym: That's what he's selling.

37
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,400
Scott: We're so far away from the World Series.

38
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,499
Scott: So let me... See, I bet you don't know how baseball playoffs work.

39
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:46,119
Rym: I don't know.

40
00:01:46,881 --> 00:01:48,318
Rym: So here's what I know about baseball.

41
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,639
Rym: Here's what I know about baseball.

42
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:56,379
Rym: A business contact I have who knows that I'm from Detroit, I hadn't seen him in a while, and I saw him.

43
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,498
Rym: And the first thing he said to me was, "It's a shame about the

44
00:01:59,518 --> 00:01:59,780
Rym: Tigers.".

45
00:02:01,143 --> 00:02:02,700
Rym: So that's about what I know the state.

46
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,380
Scott: Here's how the baseball playoffs work, right?

47
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,380
Rym: And I know the Mets are still in it because of these drunk guys.

48
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,220
Scott: There's a National League and an American League.

49
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,600
Rym: And they have slightly different rules.

50
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,058
Rym: I do know that.

51
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,840
Scott: Slightly different rules, and they're divided in half, right?

52
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:19,000
Scott: So when you do play during the regular season since the '90s, they added some interleague play.

53
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:24,940
Scott: It used to be that you didn't play teams in the other league unless it was the World Series at all, right?

54
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,759
Scott: Like during the '80s.

55
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:29,839
Scott: You didn't play the team in the American League ever unless it was the World Series.

56
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,499
Scott: But now, you do play them a bit during the regular season, but in the playoffs, you don't.

57
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,138
Scott: And at the end of the playoffs, you have one American League team and one National League team, and they go to the World Series, and that's the winner, right?

58
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,880
Scott: So each league has three divisions, right?

59
00:02:44,262 --> 00:02:45,420
Scott: East, west, and central.

60
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:52,859
Scott: So you have the winner of each division goes to the playoffs, but that is hard in an elimination bracket to have three and three.

61
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:54,420
Rym: so there's a wild card, right?

62
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,740
Scott: Unless you give someone the bye.

63
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,220
Scott: So to make four and four, they take the team with the best record.

64
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:03,399
Scott: that wasn't a division winner, and they get in too.

65
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,679
Rym: I think as a kid, in all sports that have wild card slots, that was the thing that confused me the most until an adult explained it.

66
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,273
Scott: So it's basically the team with the best record that didn't actually win.

67
00:03:15,293 --> 00:03:16,420
Scott: their division gets in.

68
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:25,659
Scott: So in the Mets division, the National League East, the Washington Nationals have the best record, except they have the second best record in the National League, so they won the division.

69
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:32,100
Scott: But it could be that because they split it up in divisions, there's a lot of situations where it's not fair.

70
00:03:32,641 --> 00:03:43,060
Scott: You were second best in your division, but the God team was in your division, and meanwhile, some shit team wins the central division, and now you're not in the playoffs, and they are, so that's why they have a wild card.

71
00:03:43,200 --> 00:04:02,800
Scott: But more recently, they added a different rule where basically instead of taking the team with the best record that didn't win their division, they take the two teams with the best record that didn't win their division, and they play one game of baseball.

72
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:05,360
Rym: So that's the crazy game that's happening tonight?

73
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:12,540
Scott: It is the wild card game, and if you win the wild card game, you go to the real playoffs against the best team.

74
00:04:13,784 --> 00:04:15,860
Rym: I almost wish hockey did that.

75
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,980
Scott: You go to the real playoffs as the bottom seed, and if you lose the wild card game, your season is over.

76
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:31,220
Scott: So the Mets, with one game remaining in the regular season, secured the wild card game home team home field advantage.

77
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,239
Scott: So the last game of the regular season, they just didn't give a fuck.

78
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:34,742
Scott: So as

79
00:04:34,782 --> 00:04:45,055
Rym: a result, not only all this, but on my train today, the train stopped at court square, and then the conductor kept yelling at these jackasses to get out of the way of the door as all these Mets fans would hold the

80
00:04:45,096 --> 00:04:46,999
Scott: door open for further Mets fans.

81
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,200
Scott: I looked at tickets for tonight's game, right?

82
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,960
Scott: This one game elimination.

83
00:04:51,502 --> 00:04:52,070
Rym: What, 1,200 bucks?

84
00:04:52,172 --> 00:04:52,720
Rym: That's my guess.

85
00:04:52,881 --> 00:04:54,479
Scott: No, but it was 500 for the nosebleeds.

86
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:55,872
Rym: So probably 1,200 for a decency.

87
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,659
Scott: I'm sure, whatever, but yes, I didn't go.

88
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,397
Rym: Yeah, so it's fine.

89
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,600
Scott: But it's not for a while.

90
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,360
Scott: Why would you go to the stadium this early?

91
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,564
Rym: The MTA, at 4.45 p.m.

92
00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:11,340
Rym: today, tweeted, "New York Mets win World Series," and they had a nice picture of it.

93
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,600
Scott: The World Series is like a month away.

94
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,700
Rym: And they said, "Basically, looking forward to when we get to light up our bridges in orange and blue.

95
00:05:16,842 --> 00:05:17,229
Rym: Let's go,

96
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:17,636
Rym: Mets!".

97
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,920
Scott: So -- Last year, at least, we were in the World Series.

98
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,860
Scott: This year, we could be done today.

99
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,799
Scott: Today could be the end.

100
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,920
Rym: Why would you take that?

101
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,160
Rym: The MTA has announced that the Mets will win the World Series.

102
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,259
Scott: Well, I guess we're not going to.

103
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:28,826
Rym: Thanks, MTA.

104
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:29,952
Rym: Thanks, MTA.

105
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,640
Scott: We're probably going to lose today because of you.

106
00:05:34,342 --> 00:05:36,239
Rym: So, in other news, it's actually kind of a big deal.

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,700
Rym: Adventure time.

108
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,839
Scott: Oh, speaking of which, right?

109
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,980
Scott: So we're playing against the San Francisco Giants.

110
00:05:41,562 --> 00:05:47,940
Scott: The San Francisco Giants won the World Series in 2010.

111
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,157
Scott: All right.

112
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:49,411
Scott: All right.

113
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:51,662
Scott: And 2014.

114
00:05:51,662 --> 00:05:54,239
Rym: So why are they fighting for the wild card slot now?

115
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,860
Scott: They won it in 2010, 2012, and 2014.

116
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,539
Rym: You're looking at the pattern.

117
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,620
Scott: And it is currently 2016.

118
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,220
Rym: Baseball has a lot more superstitious patterns than any other sport, as far as I can tell.

119
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,420
Scott: But that's not some superstition.

120
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:06,920
Scott: That happened.

121
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:12,843
Scott: They won it, the World Series, the whole thing, in 2010, 2012, and 2014.

122
00:06:12,843 --> 00:06:14,620
Scott: And it is currently 2016.

123
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,120
Scott: And we are playing them today in a single elimination game.

124
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,320
Scott: So, MTA, you're not helping.

125
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:24,351
Rym: Well, they tweeted at 444, which is an even number.

126
00:06:27,306 --> 00:06:28,139
Scott: That doesn't mean anything.

127
00:06:30,612 --> 00:06:34,079
Rym: But this is actually kind of bigger news because for a long time, Adventure Time's just been going on forever.

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,700
Scott: And-- Not forever.

129
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,960
Scott: It started like after we graduated college.

130
00:06:38,122 --> 00:06:39,759
Rym: Which is a long time ago.

131
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,339
Scott: I'm just saying, the show isn't that old.

132
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,880
Scott: I found the episode-- The Simpsons started when I was in elementary school.

133
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,720
Scott: Adventure Time is effectively a brand new fucking show.

134
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,680
Rym: We're talking about The Simpsons.

135
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:52,260
Rym: I start, but I've watched-- The Simpsons, I only watched about 12 seasons worth.

136
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,138
Scott: I'm just saying, Adventure Time, as far as I'm concerned, is a new fucking show.

137
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:02,820
Rym: But, yeah, I watched The Simpsons from my parents, got us to watch The Tracy-- Because we watched The Tracy Ullman Show.

138
00:07:02,941 --> 00:07:03,980
Rym: That was the thing we watched as a family.

139
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,460
Scott: You know what?

140
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:06,219
Scott: To this day, I don't know who Tracy Ullman is.

141
00:07:06,466 --> 00:07:06,617
Scott: Really?

142
00:07:07,346 --> 00:07:08,799
Scott: Is that a person who still does anything?

143
00:07:09,143 --> 00:07:10,260
Scott: Is that a person who's alive?

144
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,300
Rym: I do not know anything about the current state of Tracy Ullman.

145
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,679
Rym: I'm pretty sure she's still alive.

146
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,139
Scott: I never knew who it was.

147
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,819
Scott: I just knew that The Tracy Ullman Show was the show that had The Simpsons bit.

148
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:21,519
Rym: I think she's still alive.

149
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,400
Scott: What does she do?

150
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,195
Rym: Let's see what she's doing.

151
00:07:24,216 --> 00:07:24,560
Rym: Wikipedia.

152
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,320
Scott: I don't even know what she looks like.

153
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:27,885
Rym: Oh, nope.

154
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,689
Rym: She-- Yeah, born.

155
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:30,620
Rym: Not dead.

156
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:32,419
Rym: Still acting, looks like.

157
00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:33,217
Scott: In what?

158
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:34,440
Scott: Let's see.

159
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:35,759
Scott: I wouldn't know if I saw her on the street.

160
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,720
Rym: Other appearances, stage credits, music videos, filmography.

161
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:39,733
Rym: Alright.

162
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,619
Rym: Uh, she's a guest presenter and have I got news for you.

163
00:07:44,243 --> 00:07:44,999
Scott: I don't know what the hell that is.

164
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,900
Rym: She has a new show called Tracy Ullman's Show, apparently.

165
00:07:48,383 --> 00:07:48,534
Scott: Alright.

166
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,159
Rym: I should check that out.

167
00:07:50,705 --> 00:07:50,958
Rym: Okay.

168
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:54,400
Rym: Uh, she's in How I Met Your Mother, which people talk about, but I think that show's garbage.

169
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,660
Scott: I know that's a TV sitcom, so I assume it's garbage.

170
00:07:57,266 --> 00:07:57,520
Scott: Yup.

171
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,641
Scott: I assume it's basically Friends 2.

172
00:07:59,641 --> 00:08:04,378
Scott: The last thing she was on that I remember was-- Wow.

173
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,840
Rym: Now, Ally McBeal is the last thing I knew she did.

174
00:08:08,201 --> 00:08:09,859
Scott: I know that's another garbage TV sitcom.

175
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,080
Scott: I don't know anything about it, though.

176
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,439
Rym: But it was garbage TV in an era when that's all you got.

177
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,880
Rym: Like, there wasn't much non-garbage.

178
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,600
Scott: Yeah, there wasn't really.

179
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,020
Rym: As opposed to How I Met Your Mother, which is still that same garbage TV.

180
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,520
Rym: It'd be like if Seinfeld was made today.

181
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,378
Rym: You wouldn't even look at it.

182
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:20,916
Scott: No.

183
00:08:22,443 --> 00:08:22,999
Rym: So, uh, yeah.

184
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,879
Rym: I guess she's still doing stuff.

185
00:08:24,164 --> 00:08:24,460
Rym: Good for her.

186
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:24,816
Rym: Cool.

187
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,100
Rym: But, uh, Adventure Time, I was speculating a lot, because Finn's, you know, as a character, has been growing.

188
00:08:30,421 --> 00:08:36,500
Rym: Like, as the show went on, 'cause the actor got older, they just had him get older, and the tone of the show kept changing.

189
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,500
Scott: Well, I don't think it's because the actor got older, but, you know, it just sort of works out that way.

190
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,818
Rym: It might have been a little bit on purpose, 'cause his voice was changing.

191
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,400
Scott: I'm just saying, that probably was, that was probably, you know, a concern.

192
00:08:47,621 --> 00:08:51,597
Scott: But, you know, the fact, they could have easily said, "We want Finn to stay a

193
00:08:51,617 --> 00:08:51,759
Scott: kid."

194
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,000
Scott: That's our creative decision, and made that happen, if they wanted to.

195
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,319
Rym: But the fact that they didn't, and that they had him, kept getting older, and they went through, like, all these different eras.

196
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,880
Scott: I think it's also a wise business decision, 'cause your audience is getting older.

197
00:09:02,984 --> 00:09:03,046
Scott: Yup.

198
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,620
Scott: If you have a kid's show, right, you know, it's real quick.

199
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:13,340
Scott: It's like, okay, some fifth graders watching the show, and then you've done the show for five years, and now they're in high school.

200
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:22,539
Scott: So, if the show hasn't changed from being a show for elementary school kids, to a show for high school kids, and you haven't been able to get new elementary school kids into it, your show's dead.

201
00:09:22,904 --> 00:09:22,993
Rym: Yup.

202
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,140
Rym: But, because of this, and, you know, you can see, too, because the tone of the show, like, season one.

203
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,080
Scott: Like Pokemon, right?

204
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,340
Scott: Pokemon manages to somehow keep the people in, but also get the new ones, right?

205
00:09:32,421 --> 00:09:36,120
Scott: Well, 'cause Pokemon has this-- But if you just have your audience that you're serving and is aging, you need to advance.

206
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,858
Rym: Pokemon has increasing tier--.

207
00:09:38,201 --> 00:09:41,059
Rym: Pokemon does what, for some reason, no anime con can do.

208
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,656
Rym: It provides stuff for the young kid with the kid brain, who's like,

209
00:09:44,676 --> 00:09:45,259
Rym: "Yay!".

210
00:09:45,741 --> 00:09:52,419
Rym: It provides stuff for the young kid with the still kid brain, who thinks he's too sophisticated for that kid shit, 'cause Pokemon's still there for him.

211
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:58,420
Rym: It's got stuff for the college kids, it's got the video games, the adults with the nostalgia, and the IV training, and the EV training.

212
00:09:58,742 --> 00:10:02,699
Rym: I mean, it's not something nothing else does, it just-- I'm just saying, anime cons don't do it.

213
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,788
Scott: It's for all ages.

214
00:10:03,848 --> 00:10:05,380
Scott: Yeah, anime cons are not for all ages.

215
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:13,800
Rym: Pokemon's one of the few things that says it's for all ages, and actually is, as opposed to-- There's a lot of things that are, they're just, you know-- A lot of things that say they're for all ages are actually for little kids only.

216
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:20,620
Scott: It's just, I think what it is, is that things that are all ages are, that are truly all ages, are the hardest kinds of things to make.

217
00:10:20,945 --> 00:10:21,179
Scott: Yup.

218
00:10:21,763 --> 00:10:31,480
Scott: 'Cause imagine something that entertains-- The easiest kind of thing to make is something that is adults only, because basically the taste of your audience doesn't really move.

219
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:41,038
Scott: If someone goes from 30 and they're 60 now, if they've been watching it for 30 years, you can just keep doing the same exact thing, 'cause they're not really changing as much as--.

220
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:52,621
Scott: But if someone changes their age from like 10 to 16, only six years, more changes in that person's desires for media than the 30 years of 30 to 60.

221
00:10:52,621 --> 00:11:11,159
Rym: But it fit that the show, Adventure Time at least, sort of grew up with its audience on-- I mean, it obviously kind of went on purpose at one point, 'cause it started with like, yay kids stuff, and it got into increasingly complex and dire shit as he got older, and then it dealt with a lot of weird sex and adolescence issues and family issues and all that stuff.

222
00:11:11,682 --> 00:11:23,460
Rym: And I'd speculated for a long time that if the show didn't end, it was possible that it could have been like for better or for worse, where 30 years from now, Finn's 46, and the show just kept going.

223
00:11:23,621 --> 00:11:25,858
Scott: I think there's a limit to how far they can take it.

224
00:11:26,661 --> 00:11:36,338
Rym: I don't know if there is, but the problem is, every further bit that you take it requires an exponentially higher level of artistic care without fucking it up.

225
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,880
Rym: So eventually you hit this slope where it's really hard to go higher.

226
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:46,777
Rym: That's why Seinfeld ended, because in the era the slope was good, so if Seinfeld had kept going to today, that would not be a good show.

227
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,800
Scott: I mean, when anything ages, right, there's a certain limit that you can take it to, right?

228
00:11:51,840 --> 00:12:00,500
Scott: So for example, a rock band, right, is like, yeah, there's still, like, Aerosmith is still playing, but it's like, really?

229
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,740
Scott: There's like a point at which it's like, you're too old now, the show's not great anymore.

230
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,260
Rym: But at the same time, Aerosmith cover bands continue to do their thing forever.

231
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:15,180
Scott: Yeah, the music itself doesn't get old, right, because it's the same song, but it's like the people in the band, right?

232
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:28,260
Scott: And you can see the biggest example of that if you watch some idol group or something, right, is like, they're in schoolgirl uniforms, like, dancing, and it's like, when they get to be 30, they can't do it that long, because it doesn't work anymore.

233
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,560
Rym: And meanwhile, look at The Simpsons, which is probably going to be America's most enduring television cultural icon ever.

234
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:36,640
Rym: It's basically Artur Ayman.

235
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,577
Scott: Bart's still in the same class.

236
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:46,080
Rym: But notice how that show, even in the first, like, ten seasons, went through many different eras with different styles of comedy.

237
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:52,860
Rym: There's like four or five different versions of Homer, ranging from actually evil and malicious to mentally challenged.

238
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:59,860
Rym: And, like, you can pick out eras of The Simpsons, and eventually they expanded increasingly into all the side characters.

239
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,515
Rym: They brought Sideshow Bob back, like, 15 times.

240
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:04,799
Scott: Is that really that many times?

241
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:06,900
Rym: I found, because we've been watching old Simpsons.

242
00:13:07,402 --> 00:13:12,600
Scott: I think, you know, because I was watching in the Sideshow Bob era, where, like, he would come back and it'd be, like, a new episode, right?

243
00:13:13,265 --> 00:13:15,080
Rym: Like, the Kate Fear one was probably the best one, though.

244
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:22,272
Scott: But it's like, I think there was a time, it was, like, maybe, like, the fourth time or fifth time he came back, and it was, like, that was supposed to be the true.

245
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,780
Scott: last time he came back.

246
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:29,460
Scott: And it was for-- Dude, at what point-- There was a point at which, like, he didn't come back again for a long time.

247
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,760
Scott: Well, because he was in jail with his family, and he was crazy.

248
00:13:31,861 --> 00:13:33,759
Scott: It's like that one was really the last one.

249
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,040
Rym: But he came back in an episode where, I guess, he augmented his DNA with animal powers.

250
00:13:39,106 --> 00:13:40,079
Scott: I did not see that one.

251
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,320
Rym: Yeah, I saw a clip, because I was looking up recent Simpsons.

252
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:46,039
Rym: But it's just going to keep going, I think.

253
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,640
Rym: And that's because they're willing to, like, they change up the show a lot.

254
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:56,099
Rym: But unlike Adventure Time, The Simpsons does not need to maintain a serious artistic continuity.

255
00:13:57,281 --> 00:14:00,620
Rym: It just needs to maintain a certain baseline level of humor.

256
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,300
Scott: All right, so I got you-- Adventure Time's ending, great.

257
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:04,679
Scott: I got a bunch of tiny newses, ready?

258
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:05,080
Scott: All right.

259
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,220
Scott: Tiny news number one.

260
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,539
Scott: The Garbage New York Comic-Con is this weekend, I think?

261
00:14:09,085 --> 00:14:09,679
Scott: Oh, yeah.

262
00:14:10,103 --> 00:14:10,440
Scott: Whatever.

263
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:16,719
Scott: There's probably going to be a bunch of Wednesday news coming out of it that we're going to tell you about two weeks from now.

264
00:14:17,101 --> 00:14:19,280
Rym: I'm definitely not going to New York Comic-Con.

265
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,340
Scott: But Rin won't be here two weeks from now, I don't think.

266
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,760
Scott: So you're going to have to wait even longer.

267
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,960
Rym: Yeah, I'm flying to Sydney on Monday, and then I'll be back two Mondays later.

268
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,500
Scott: So just read the internet for that news.

269
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,459
Scott: Okay, second tiny news.

270
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:46,560
Scott: Showing, I think, for like one night, or like-- It's a very limited engagement of Shin Gojira, also known as Gojira Resurgence, the live-action Godzilla movie that is made by Hideaki Anno.

271
00:14:47,341 --> 00:14:52,320
Scott: It looks like it's an amazing Godzilla movie, better than the other new one that came out recently in America.

272
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,298
Rym: I would go see it.

273
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:59,320
Scott: Based on the trailer alone, it looks like Evangelion only replaced the Avas with Godzilla.

274
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:06,480
Scott: There's only one of them, and there's just a military only to fight it back, and not like another monster or something.

275
00:15:07,381 --> 00:15:14,860
Scott: It's like you watch the trailer, and it's like there are shots from Evangelion in the trailer, only with things changed and live-action.

276
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,940
Scott: Even the glass shatters in the way he draws glass shattering.

277
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,506
Scott: Anyway, also, Ms.

278
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:29,480
Scott: Hogusai, new anime movie, is going to have a much less limited run that you can go see starting like two weeks from now or so.

279
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,400
Scott: It's already had some preview screenings and whatnot.

280
00:15:32,901 --> 00:15:35,440
Rym: I mean, if you live in New York, you can see stuff like this pretty easy.

281
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,973
Scott: The Makoto Shinkai movie, not screening in the U.S.

282
00:15:39,455 --> 00:15:53,880
Scott: yet, as far as I know, but apparently it's making big money in Japan, more money than I think any Makoto Shinkai movie has made previously, and more money than many, many other Japanese movies.

283
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,700
Rym: Is that Kimi no Wa, that one?

284
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:57,529
Scott: I don't know, the newest one.

285
00:15:57,649 --> 00:15:59,540
Scott: It's in Japanese theaters now.

286
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,644
Rym: Your name, yeah.

287
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,240
Scott: There's tons of, basically it's movie season in the anime world.

288
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:18,339
Scott: Even though there's a new anime TV season, I looked at the chart, and even though we're not doing our thing, because it's not Anime Boston right now, I saw almost nothing on that chart.

289
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:24,680
Scott: Like cancel your Crunchyroll, turn it back on next year, because there's nothing to see.

290
00:16:25,261 --> 00:16:29,580
Rym: I got to catch up on stuff that we reviewed or that looked good that I just haven't watched all the way through yet.

291
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:31,600
Scott: If that's your situation.

292
00:16:31,962 --> 00:16:35,060
Scott: But right now, I got my Hulu on, because South Park.

293
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,025
Rym: South Park.

294
00:16:36,186 --> 00:16:37,940
Rym: Hulu is basically pay for South Park.

295
00:16:38,561 --> 00:16:46,000
Scott: Well, there's also old movies to watch, but it's like, man, last year, you're watching South Park, and you're like, goddamn, how do they keep upping the whatever?

296
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,249
Scott: They upped it even more.

297
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:48,419
Scott: How could they do it?

298
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,579
Rym: Scott, remember South Park?

299
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,284
Scott: I know.

300
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:53,089
Scott: Oh man, remember Adventure Time?

301
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:56,479
Scott: Remember the Simpsons, when it was still good?

302
00:17:00,507 --> 00:17:02,920
Rym: Well, I think we'll be talking about South Park on the show at some point.

303
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,599
Scott: We might have to do a South Park season review episode or something.

304
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:12,119
Rym: Yeah, pretty much from the last season onward, like as soon as, like, does she know she's an ad?

305
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,319
Rym: Like the show just kicked into super gear.

306
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:14,973
Scott: Oh yeah.

307
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:19,680
Rym: And it kind of started with the episode where Stan grew up, and everything looked like shit.

308
00:17:20,246 --> 00:17:21,079
Rym: That was the beginning of that.

309
00:17:23,102 --> 00:17:26,900
Rym: So, speaking of how, you know, we're not going to New York Comic Con, because, like, no lie, it sucks.

310
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,188
Rym: Like, we live here.

311
00:17:28,228 --> 00:17:29,119
Rym: It's not worth going to.

312
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,960
Rym: It's kind of like an anti-convention.

313
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:35,472
Rym: There is going to be a new New York Anime Convention.

314
00:17:35,753 --> 00:17:42,840
Rym: that is not the New York Anime Festival, which was run by and then thrown into the ground by the Reed Expositions of New York Comic Con.

315
00:17:43,381 --> 00:17:51,520
Rym: So now, Left Field Media, which looks like it's going to be pretty good, we'll see, has an all-star cast on the back end of the kinds of people who run conventions.

316
00:17:53,941 --> 00:18:01,180
Scott: It's sponsored by all the American anime companies, and they've managed to rent out the Javits, which is not easy to do.

317
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,412
Rym: And they're launching November 17th through 19th, 2017, so next year, Anime NYC.

318
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,160
Rym: And I can guarantee we will be there doing panels.

319
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:21,540
Scott: So it seems like, you know, I'm going to go, but it's like, are they trying to make something good, or are they trying to make Anime Expo of the East?

320
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:31,477
Rym: So, I know there's things I can't talk about, because I independently, a bunch of people who work for this convention reached out to me separately, like, "Oh, hey, by the way, this is where I ended

321
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:31,618
Rym: up.".

322
00:18:32,021 --> 00:18:35,360
Rym: So, that's why I say it's an all-star cast of people who know what the fuck they're doing.

323
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,639
Scott: They're half the people, like people that we know, because that's how it is.

324
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,160
Scott: And there are other anime conventions in New York.

325
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,334
Scott: There's actually one recently in a hotel.

326
00:18:44,354 --> 00:18:45,159
Scott: It was really dumpy.

327
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:47,479
Rym: I was going to submit panels, and I forgot.

328
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,139
Scott: It had almost no guests or anything that I've ever heard of.

329
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:58,298
Scott: But I walked out of my office one day, because the hotel is like two blocks from my office, and a cosplayer walked by, and I was like, "That looks really

330
00:18:58,318 --> 00:18:58,640
Scott: familiar.".

331
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,206
Scott: I'm like, "Oh, right, I remember.

332
00:19:00,226 --> 00:19:03,078
Scott: There's that really garbagey con in a hotel near my

333
00:19:03,158 --> 00:19:03,460
Scott: office.".

334
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,819
Scott: Now, I think this one will succeed, and the main reason-- This is a real convention.

335
00:19:07,343 --> 00:19:16,120
Rym: Even when the New York Comic-Con ruined the New York Anime Festival, and just kind of relegated to that weird ghetto, a lot of people went to the New York Comic-Con just for that.

336
00:19:17,042 --> 00:19:29,580
Scott: So, if this is the closest likelihood-- But will they have a marketing budget where it will get enough people to come in, but they didn't spend so much money on marketing that they can pay the Javits bill?

337
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:39,678
Rym: Yeah, but it looks like it's backed by real company and everything, but if ever there will be an anime convention that gets run the way PAX is run, this is the closest thing to it.

338
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:47,679
Rym: So, either this is going to be the PAX of anime cons, or it's possible it'll be an anime expo of the East, and we'll go to the first one and never go back.

339
00:19:48,120 --> 00:20:00,828
Scott: Sure, but I think what we can do is if all of us anime-type peoples who are good and make good anime-con stuffs all come to this con and support it and make it happen, this is our chance.

340
00:20:01,593 --> 00:20:02,660
Scott: We can make the con good.

341
00:20:03,905 --> 00:20:07,458
Scott: We don't have to completely stand back and say, "Is this con gonna be

342
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:07,739
Scott: good?".

343
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,320
Scott: We can try to make it good with our token efforts.

344
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:17,555
Rym: Like, I gotta whisper in the right ears to make sure that if we're gonna do panels, Anime World Order is gonna--.

345
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,567
Rym: Let's just put in a moderate effort to try to make it good.

346
00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:26,000
Rym: Like, get him to take my tool and get my hotel room and come in.

347
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,640
Scott: And if it still sucks, then alright, fuck it.

348
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:35,702
Scott: But, you know, for one year, for one con, for a con that's in town and we're easy to get to because it's in New York City, the center of the world-- Country World.

349
00:20:35,722 --> 00:20:38,940
Rym: Funimation, Viz, Kinokuniya are the four main sponsors so far.

350
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,039
Rym: So, every company that cares about anime and manga in the

351
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:42,140
Rym: U.S.--

352
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:49,340
Rym: Leftfield Media founder Greg Tapalian and Leftfield Media's head of content, Peter Tatara, are organizing the convention.

353
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,406
Rym: Oh, good, I'd say, yeah, they're both formally affiliated with ReadPop, New York Comic Con.

354
00:20:55,312 --> 00:20:56,339
Rym: Yeah, these people know what's up.

355
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,240
Rym: But, anyway, things of the day.

356
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:15,020
Rym: So, a while ago, 'cause Halloween's coming up and drone technology got pretty good, I posited that this might be the Halloween of skeleton drone pranks.

357
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:15,859
Scott: Sounds good to me.

358
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:20,319
Rym: Now, I feel like the perfect form of a skeleton drone prank is-- Wouldn't it be easier to do a ghost, though?

359
00:21:20,824 --> 00:21:22,837
Scott: Yeah, but the skull-- You basically put an umbrella over the--.

360
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,736
Scott: Would that still be able to fly with an umbrella?

361
00:21:24,837 --> 00:21:25,180
Scott: I don't know.

362
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:32,920
Rym: Yeah, so, basically, my ideal prank is you have a light foam skull, a really good-looking one, and you hang it from a string in the bottom of a drone.

363
00:21:33,461 --> 00:21:35,458
Scott: You fly up-- You make the drone all black.

364
00:21:35,866 --> 00:21:35,952
Scott: Yeah.

365
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,040
Scott: And you have a glowy skull from the bottom of it, and you fly the drone around, and it looks like a-- And you need some LEDs--.

366
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,680
Scott: It looks like a skull that's floating around.

367
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,440
Rym: It needs some LED lights, like little ones.

368
00:21:43,561 --> 00:21:45,616
Scott: And you put some noise-making, so it sounds like--.

369
00:21:46,323 --> 00:21:47,560
Rym: But, basically, yeah, exactly.

370
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,099
Rym: But what you do, here's to make a key.

371
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:53,480
Rym: It's gotta fly up to a second or third or higher story window.

372
00:21:54,300 --> 00:22:10,275
Rym: Bonus points in an apartment building if you're, like, six or seven stories up, because, think of this, if you're-- Think of this, if I'm in my apartment, and I'm asleep, and I'm over, we're pretty high up, and suddenly I hear something tapping on the window of a skyscraper, and I hear a weird noise-- There you go.

373
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,400
Scott: I'm gonna get up, I'll blur you out.

374
00:22:11,562 --> 00:22:16,480
Scott: Here's the problem, as a drone makes noise, I think you need to dangle the skeleton from, like, a somewhat, like, fishing line.

375
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,560
Rym: Oh, the skull's gotta dangle, like, ten feet.

376
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:23,280
Scott: So the drone can be higher, where the person won't necessarily hear it or notice it, and the skeleton can be free-swinging.

377
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,920
Rym: But, I mean, the seven train's right out there.

378
00:22:25,602 --> 00:22:29,799
Rym: In a building like this, the windows do not let sound through, but if you tap them, you'll hear it.

379
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,980
Scott: Well, also, it's mad illegal to fly drones almost anywhere in the city.

380
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,020
Rym: I am not concerned with the legality of my skull drone prank.

381
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:43,380
Scott: Uh, but I-- This is the only reason I have not gotten into drone as a hobby, because I live in pretty much the only place where that's an illegal hobby.

382
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,279
Scott: Yeah, same-- If I moved out to the sticks, I'd probably buy some drones.

383
00:22:46,842 --> 00:22:50,020
Rym: Similar reason why, as much as I like model rockets, I don't make model rockets anymore.

384
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,588
Scott: There is a Kickstarter, though, for--.

385
00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:53,660
Scott: Remember the Vortex football?

386
00:22:54,061 --> 00:22:54,228
Scott: Oh, yeah.

387
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,280
Scott: It was basically a football with wings on the back.

388
00:22:56,804 --> 00:22:58,500
Scott: It would be-- It was easy to throw it in a spiral.

389
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,311
Scott: They basically made this thing.

390
00:23:00,331 --> 00:23:04,019
Scott: that's like a vortex, and you shove your GoPro in the front, and then you throw it.

391
00:23:04,303 --> 00:23:04,799
Rym: I saw that.

392
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,531
Scott: And that's great, because there's nowhere.

393
00:23:06,572 --> 00:23:07,820
Scott: that's, you know, illegal.

394
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,300
Rym: You could use that on a ski slope.

395
00:23:09,641 --> 00:23:10,819
Scott: You could use it anywhere, pretty much.

396
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,979
Scott: So, uh, it's a lot of money, though, for a piece of foam.

397
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:15,072
Rym: But that's the key.

398
00:23:15,092 --> 00:23:20,680
Scott: You've got to-- Which is why I didn't buy it, but it'd be really cool, like, you know, to throw it at certain places with, like, a large crowd.

399
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,819
Scott: Like, you go to PAX tabletop, throw it, have your friend catch it, and you get a good shot.

400
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,419
Rym: No, you'll get this video of someone catching it and running away with your camera.

401
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,557
Scott: You throw it to your friend.

402
00:23:28,061 --> 00:23:28,162
Rym: Uh-oh.

403
00:23:28,568 --> 00:23:29,338
Rym: Someone intercepts.

404
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,100
Rym: [laughter] Drone camera interception.

405
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,549
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I hope you're going for some height so you can get a good-- But just imagine that.

406
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,440
Rym: You're in a skyscraper.

407
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,979
Rym: You hear something tapping on the window.

408
00:23:40,321 --> 00:23:44,759
Rym: You open the blend, and there's a skull swinging forward at your face out the window.

409
00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:45,500
Scott: Yeah, pretty good.

410
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,820
Rym: So, this person-- I was looking around.

411
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,620
Rym: This is the best drone skeleton prank to date.

412
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,595
Scott: And the way they got-- Is it up to our expectations, or is it just--.

413
00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:03,260
Rym: So, the way they did it is they put the skull on top of the drone, and they have the eyes light up, and the drone noise kind of makes it sound like it's screaming.

414
00:24:04,061 --> 00:24:06,279
Rym: And then they hung all these streamers down.

415
00:24:06,642 --> 00:24:10,319
Rym: so it looks like this giant thing that's floating and-- Don't the streamers get caught in the blades?

416
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,919
Rym: Uh, no, it actually works pretty well.

417
00:24:12,223 --> 00:24:12,317
Rym: Okay.

418
00:24:13,446 --> 00:24:13,980
Scott: And it works--.

419
00:24:14,081 --> 00:24:16,440
Scott: I can see the wind from the blades is blowing the streamers.

420
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:16,588
Scott: Yeah.

421
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,318
Scott: That's pretty good.

422
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,640
Rym: And think, it looks creepy.

423
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,960
Rym: Like, look, people are walking, and suddenly it comes around the corner.

424
00:24:22,422 --> 00:24:25,580
Scott: [laughter] But it's obviously a drone is the problem.

425
00:24:26,101 --> 00:24:28,960
Rym: It is obviously a drone after your first reaction.

426
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,526
Rym: So, you go,

427
00:24:29,566 --> 00:24:29,891
Rym: "Whoa!"

428
00:24:29,912 --> 00:24:30,419
Rym: and freak out.

429
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,240
Scott: Yeah, but that's not scaring people, like, really.

430
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,654
Scott: That's just sort of like jump out, go,

431
00:24:33,694 --> 00:24:33,775
Scott: "Boo!"

432
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:34,479
Scott: Right?

433
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:36,278
Rym: If you put the-- No, it's got two levels.

434
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:44,920
Scott: If you had the drone way up high, and the skeleton on a string way down low, the effect would be floating fucking skeleton hole.

435
00:24:45,061 --> 00:24:46,420
Scott: It would be a double effect, right?

436
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,415
Scott: You could surprise them, and then, "Oh, my--".

437
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,859
Scott: There's no way you would know what is going on.

438
00:24:52,347 --> 00:24:55,420
Scott: First, your brain would be surprised, and then your brain would register.

439
00:24:56,403 --> 00:25:03,579
Scott: There is no explanation for what I'm seeing in front of me, other than floating skeleton with no seemingly human thing attached to it.

440
00:25:05,264 --> 00:25:10,200
Scott: It would be a really good magic trick that fools you, the way a magician cuts someone in half, and your brain is totally fooled.

441
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,660
Rym: Yeah, it's got to be a good knife for flying.

442
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,159
Rym: So, this is the best I've seen anyone do yet.

443
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:19,099
Scott: So, all of you out there-- Step it up to the level which we describe, people who are allowed to have drones.

444
00:25:19,241 --> 00:25:21,180
Rym: Don't get arrested, and I didn't tell you to do this.

445
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,212
Rym: I got nothing to do with you.

446
00:25:22,232 --> 00:25:24,639
Rym: if you get in trouble, but do it.

447
00:25:25,181 --> 00:25:25,495
Scott: Go for it.

448
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:26,959
Scott: A better thing of the day.

449
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,898
Scott: So, remember the last time I had a thing of the day about how to smash the garlics?

450
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:31,669
Rym: That was pretty good.

451
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:32,199
Rym: I remember that.

452
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,215
Scott: I remember.

453
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,680
Scott: Here is something else garlic-related.

454
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,940
Scott: Rym, do you know what aioli is?

455
00:25:38,061 --> 00:25:38,959
Rym: I know what aioli is.

456
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:43,420
Rym: It's the thing that is on the best of the burgers that I get at the fancy places.

457
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:43,865
Scott: That is true.

458
00:25:43,886 --> 00:25:45,019
Scott: Do you know how to make aioli?

459
00:25:45,365 --> 00:25:45,493
Rym: No.

460
00:25:45,981 --> 00:25:47,480
Rym: I imagine you'd use a grind of a bunch of garlic.

461
00:25:48,356 --> 00:25:48,440
Scott: No.

462
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:57,698
Scott: So, apparently most places that say they're giving you aioli, and most recipes, even Blue Apron-- I did a Blue Apron recipe once that had me make aioli.

463
00:25:58,501 --> 00:26:07,880
Scott: Almost all aioli that you will get in the United States, or in most places, period, is pretty much just mayonnaise with garlic smashed up and mixed together, right?

464
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,159
Scott: With maybe something else, like salt and pepper, who knows what, right?

465
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,660
Scott: But mostly it's mayonnaise plus garlic.

466
00:26:12,123 --> 00:26:12,537
Scott: And you know what?

467
00:26:12,962 --> 00:26:15,640
Scott: I don't like mayonnaise, but that is actually quite delicious.

468
00:26:16,084 --> 00:26:17,300
Scott: No one's gonna complain about that.

469
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:18,379
Scott: No one's saying it tastes bad.

470
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:25,099
Scott: But actually, if you are a pedant or a food snob, that is not aioli.

471
00:26:26,103 --> 00:26:27,659
Scott: That is not what aioli actually is.

472
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,279
Scott: That is just garlic mayonnaise.

473
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:36,340
Scott: Real aioli is nothing but oil and garlic emulsified and such.

474
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,100
Scott: So the way to make it is-- I see what he's doing here.

475
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:48,040
Scott: You take some garlic, and you mortar and pestle it, and then you add, you know, a little salt, which helps smash the garlic and also get the flavor out.

476
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:52,340
Scott: And then you add the oil, and you smash it some more.

477
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,497
Rym: I've got some oil.

478
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,860
Rym: And you keep adding oil and smashing-- I've got some garlic.

479
00:26:56,144 --> 00:26:56,420
Scott: Right.

480
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,579
Rym: Garlic oil.

481
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:06,819
Scott: You keep adding oil and smashing and oil and smashing so that, you know, if you add oil to oil at once, you'll get the oil separating from the garlic, and then you've ruined it.

482
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:13,137
Scott: You have to add a little bit at a time so that all the oil emulsifies into the paste, and that's the real aioli.

483
00:27:13,762 --> 00:27:16,560
Scott: So I had to go on Amazon and buy a mortar and pestle.

484
00:27:16,742 --> 00:27:17,240
Scott: They're pretty cheap.

485
00:27:17,862 --> 00:27:19,920
Rym: I've got a real nice one that we use occasionally.

486
00:27:20,081 --> 00:27:24,980
Scott: This one that I saw on Amazon, there was quite a few to choose from, and they all had high ratings, so they were all effectively perfect.

487
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,900
Rym: It's hard to fuck up a mortar and pestle.

488
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:31,040
Scott: But the one that I picked was a really good one that is, like, ceramic.

489
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:42,339
Scott: The stone ones you think are, like, the better ones, but actually the stone ones, even though they're nice and heavy and get the job done, some of them will, like, release, you know, chalk into the food.

490
00:27:42,824 --> 00:27:44,580
Scott: In very small amounts, you won't even notice.

491
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,619
Scott: It's not a real concern.

492
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:51,960
Scott: But there were some ceramic ones, and the reason I like the ceramic one better is it had rubber grippies, so they don't move around on you.

493
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:53,740
Scott: And they were the same price, so who cares?

494
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,640
Scott: So I bought one on Amazon.

495
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,720
Scott: I'm going to make some real aiolis and put it on some delicious meats.

496
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,138
Scott: But here's a video showing you how to do this, and there you go.

497
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,738
Scott: You learned something about foods.

498
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:06,400
Rym: All right.

499
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,159
Rym: In a moment, the Book Club book is Rebecca.

500
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:10,260
Rym: Rebecca.

501
00:28:11,142 --> 00:28:13,119
Rym: And I did a little -- I was just -- I kept looking at it.

502
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,011
Rym: I figured out.

503
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:14,660
Rym: I'm pretty sure.

504
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,917
Rym: Now I'm going to read the book, and then we'll do the review of it.

505
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:26,240
Rym: But I watched some clips from the movie "Rebecca," just a couple of clips from this, like, Hitchcock thing, and I'm pretty sure I figured out why my kid brain conflated the two movies together.

506
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:33,300
Rym: There are a large number of extremely superficial similarities if your kid brain is looking at the movie from the shallowest perspective.

507
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:43,339
Rym: But otherwise, I'm going to be in Australia for the next two weeks, and Emily and I will be recording stuff while I'm there, and then we'll resume GeekNights as soon as I get back.

508
00:28:43,801 --> 00:28:48,300
Scott: I'm going to make a bunch of content because I got nothing else to do, so I'm going to make mad videos and shit.

509
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,760
Rym: Unfortunately, I'm not there for PAX.

510
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:55,099
Rym: I'm there for this other unrelated thing, and I'm flying home right before PAX, Why wouldn't you stay there for the PAX?

511
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:01,459
Rym: Because I would have had to stay for a whole 'nother week in between, and I would have been gone for over a month in the end.

512
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,860
Rym: I would have been gone for one month, and it's real hard to disrupt your adult life for an entire month.

513
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:09,756
Scott: Also, I think the visa that I had, was it 90 days?

514
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:15,500
Scott: I forget if the automatic sign-up online visa was long enough for that.

515
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:18,919
Rym: I sign up for the business one online, but I can stay there for three months.

516
00:29:19,161 --> 00:29:19,780
Scott: Oh, it's plenty of time.

517
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,576
Rym: Yeah, it's plenty of time.

518
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:26,479
Rym: But also, our video from our most recent PAX panel, Grinding, is up on the YouTube-y.

519
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:27,860
Scott: And not the mortar and pestle kind.

520
00:29:27,942 --> 00:29:28,077
Scott: Nope.

521
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,500
Rym: Well, I used that image from South Park of them grinding up in World of Warcraft, so that kind of grinding.

522
00:29:34,644 --> 00:29:37,060
Rym: And we're going to be at MagFest doing a whole bunch of panels.

523
00:29:37,162 --> 00:29:39,057
Rym: We're still sorting all that out, but we will be there.

524
00:29:40,141 --> 00:29:44,320
Rym: And PAX South, pretty much going to say we're going to be there at this point.

525
00:29:44,604 --> 00:29:44,731
Rym: I mean...

526
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,740
Scott: I just bought plane tickets.

527
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:56,820
Scott: We won't know... So if they don't accept my panel, and I already have a hotel and a plane ticket to go to San Antonio, so I'm sure I can buy a PAX South ticket second-hand, worst-case scenario.

528
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,080
Rym: It'll be real weird if we go to a PAX and don't do a panel.

529
00:29:59,141 --> 00:29:59,660
Scott: I highly doubt.

530
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,520
Scott: That's never happened.

531
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,138
Scott: We were worried they wouldn't accept our prime panel, and they did.

532
00:30:03,441 --> 00:30:06,080
Scott: I'm pretty sure we're going to safely get our South panel accepted.

533
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,590
Scott: Dude, I just...

534
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,679
Rym: I can't ever... I never assume these things.

535
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,695
Scott: I don't assume, but I'm like 90% sure.

536
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:17,360
Scott: I'm not... I'm secure enough that I do not feel like I have to buy a PAX South ticket.

537
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:17,689
Rym: Yup.

538
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:23,100
Rym: We also got to bring Dune there and play a high-stakes game of Dune, meaning we got to really learn the expert rules.

539
00:30:23,341 --> 00:30:24,260
Scott: We're going to bring lots of good stuff.

540
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,560
Rym: Yeah, but I'm not playing baby Dune.

541
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,860
Rym: I'm done with no baby mode.

542
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,720
Scott: I'm done with baby mode on every game ever.

543
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:33,439
Rym: But we have to play Dune with the full rules at least once before we go to this PAX.

544
00:30:34,028 --> 00:30:34,219
Scott: Sure.

545
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,640
Rym: Because we've never played it with the real rules.

546
00:30:35,721 --> 00:30:38,798
Scott: And yet, four more people who are willing to sit there for that amount of time.

547
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,190
Rym: Yup.

548
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:39,980
Scott: Working on it.

549
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,040
Scott: And are serious gamers.

550
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,439
Rym: So we needed a Wednesday show to do, and there's a bunch of anime I'm going to watch all the way through, but I've just been busy.

551
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,240
Rym: I'm probably going to catch up on a lot of that when I'm traveling.

552
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,640
Rym: But a lot of people, at least in my Twitter feed, have been talking about Mob Psycho 100.

553
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,160
Scott: So I did not... I had not heard of the show.

554
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,640
Scott: I had not seen anything about the show.

555
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,180
Scott: I knew nothing.

556
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,719
Scott: I didn't see a hype like I did when there was, say, like Madoka going on.

557
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:06,059
Scott: But that was because I just didn't realize those tweets were about this show.

558
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:15,320
Scott: There was a whole meme going on taking the character from this show and redrawing different situations from other media with him instead of whatever.

559
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,679
Scott: And I did not realize that's what this was.

560
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,757
Rym: That's why it was sort of... It was weird because I was like...

561
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:24,180
Scott: But actually, I have to say, knowing the character now makes the meme less funny.

562
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,337
Scott: It was funnier when I just knew that it was a character from an anime.

563
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,139
Scott: And now that I know about that character, that meme is less funny to me.

564
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:31,958
Scott: But I'm glad now.

565
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,679
Scott: I haven't seen that meme in like a week.

566
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,700
Scott: Well, because we moved on to that... I won't have any unfunny tweets in my feed.

567
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,579
Scott: I got the maximum enjoyment from the meme.

568
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,660
Rym: But if you were talking about Mob Psycho, I saw it all over the place.

569
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,338
Rym: I guess Scott did too and just didn't realize it.

570
00:31:44,581 --> 00:31:45,520
Scott: Well, I only saw that meme.

571
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,619
Scott: I didn't see anything else about it.

572
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:51,040
Rym: And then I realized it's based on a webcomic by the same guy who did One Punch Man.

573
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,160
Scott: So the guy who made One Punch Man made a not-so-good-looking webcomic.

574
00:31:55,201 --> 00:31:56,119
Scott: Still better than I can draw.

575
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:56,820
Scott: Right?

576
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:03,800
Scott: And then One Punch Man, the real manga, is still written by him, but drawn by someone better at drawing.

577
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,560
Scott: And then the anime by people who are even better, because they can animate.

578
00:32:08,783 --> 00:32:14,263
Scott: But he made a different webcomic, the original guy, called Mob Psycho 100.

579
00:32:14,263 --> 00:32:15,959
Scott: And this is an anime based on that.

580
00:32:17,164 --> 00:32:21,980
Scott: I don't think there is a better drawn manga version of Mob Psycho 100.

581
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,295
Scott: There might be.

582
00:32:23,181 --> 00:32:24,760
Rym: I think there is, actually.

583
00:32:24,922 --> 00:32:25,432
Scott: Oh, there is?

584
00:32:25,513 --> 00:32:25,779
Scott: Okay.

585
00:32:26,082 --> 00:32:27,740
Rym: I saw some people talking about the manga.

586
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:31,080
Rym: I assume they refer to a real remade manga, not just the webcomic.

587
00:32:31,164 --> 00:32:31,498
Scott: Who knows?

588
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,817
Rym: I don't actually know.

589
00:32:33,665 --> 00:32:34,757
Scott: So Rym was like, "Watch

590
00:32:34,797 --> 00:32:34,959
Scott: this.".

591
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,439
Scott: So then I remembered this morning, I hadn't watched it, so I watched it right before I went to work.

592
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,780
Rym: I also watched one episode.

593
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,120
Scott: I only watched one episode.

594
00:32:41,743 --> 00:32:43,940
Scott: And I don't know if one episode is enough to review.

595
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,020
Scott: I mean, you could say it's not enough to review any show, but I'm not reviewing the whole show.

596
00:32:48,622 --> 00:32:51,760
Scott: But it's based on the preview to episode two.

597
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:56,460
Scott: I don't think this show is going to have formulaic episodes where they're all the same.

598
00:32:57,681 --> 00:33:00,900
Scott: So I don't know if I'm going to... I'm only going to judge this first episode.

599
00:33:01,001 --> 00:33:02,178
Scott: I can't judge anything else.

600
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:07,471
Scott: It's not one of those shows where it's like, "Ah, I can tell there's a shounen fighting show, and every episode is going to be the same

601
00:33:07,511 --> 00:33:07,753
Scott: deal.".

602
00:33:09,143 --> 00:33:11,139
Scott: You know, the first episode is just setting things up.

603
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:11,589
Rym: Yep.

604
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:23,859
Rym: What struck me, though, is that it started, and this will sound kind of weird, but it starts kind of in media res in this weird action scene that's not really explained, and then it sort of reveals implicitly later what it's actually about.

605
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:24,188
Rym: Yep.

606
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:28,739
Rym: But it was really colorful in a way that I don't often see.

607
00:33:29,584 --> 00:33:32,900
Rym: The action was just really stark, bright, vibrant colors.

608
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:41,720
Scott: Well, I think what it is is the designs of the monsters and the spirits that they're fighting, the bad guys, basically, are really unique and interesting.

609
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,092
Scott: Yep.

610
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,310
Scott: Right?

611
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,819
Scott: They're not quite as good as the Monika ones.

612
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:45,727
Rym: Yeah.

613
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,440
Scott: They're still like the witches, but they're still really good, right?

614
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:57,998
Scott: It's like, you know, even just... You know, anime actually has a history of having lots of unique monsters and have Pokemons, right?

615
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:04,580
Scott: But it's like this is yet another example of that done well, where all the bad guys are unique and different and really cool-looking.

616
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,000
Rym: All the normal characters are, too.

617
00:34:06,262 --> 00:34:10,719
Rym: True to this style, every character has a very, very unique character design.

618
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:19,239
Scott: But they all have the characteristic, you know, bottom half of a circle eyeballs that are unique to the one-punch man guy.

619
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:19,726
Rym: Yep.

620
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,609
Rym: But the story basically is about this kid Mob, and it basically means, like...

621
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,139
Scott: They told us his real name, but apparently that doesn't matter.

622
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:34,478
Rym: The descriptions say straight up that that is a term for background characters.

623
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:35,679
Scott: Interesting.

624
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,040
Rym: That is used, apparently, in anime, but it means like background character, effectively.

625
00:34:39,321 --> 00:34:41,498
Scott: Oh, like mobs, like an MMO.

626
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,386
Scott: I guess.

627
00:34:42,507 --> 00:34:43,260
Rym: I'm not actually sure.

628
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,139
Scott: Like farming mobs.

629
00:34:44,684 --> 00:34:49,210
Rym: But he's a, quote, "He's a boy who will explode if his emotional capacity reaches

630
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,621
Rym: 100%.".

631
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:53,737
Scott: Yeah, so I don't know how they quantify that, but I guess they do.

632
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,220
Rym: But what's interesting is you watch the first episode and there's a point where there's like the eye-catch.

633
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:02,100
Rym: It shows the... And it basically shows what his number is now.

634
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,560
Scott: Yeah, it keeps showing his numbers.

635
00:35:03,821 --> 00:35:06,519
Scott: And I imagine... Is someone there with a scouter, like, showing you?

636
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,170
Rym: There are only...

637
00:35:07,741 --> 00:35:09,660
Scott: Is that 99,000?

638
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:19,460
Rym: And in the opening, like, set, it basically shows him as a psychic demon entity fighting increasingly dire monsters in this crazy psychic world.

639
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,860
Scott: But being so powerful that he just beats them all, no problem.

640
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:22,182
Scott: Yep.

641
00:35:22,464 --> 00:35:24,020
Rym: And the numbers keep going up.

642
00:35:24,161 --> 00:35:25,052
Scott: And when it gets to 100, he explodes.

643
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,960
Scott: It's like, whoa, and destroys everything.

644
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:27,309
Rym: Yep.

645
00:35:27,641 --> 00:35:29,278
Rym: So you know what the opening theme's title is?

646
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:38,319
Scott: So the key is it's like a video game where you have to, like, make sure you hit 100 when there's a monster nearby that's so strong you couldn't beat it and it gets beat by the explosion and then you're back to zero and you're good.

647
00:35:38,921 --> 00:35:40,139
Rym: Maybe, or maybe it ends the world.

648
00:35:40,462 --> 00:35:43,219
Rym: But you don't want to offend the gods by having a number too high.

649
00:35:43,629 --> 00:35:43,799
Scott: No.

650
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,058
Rym: But you know what the name of the opening theme is?

651
00:35:46,325 --> 00:35:46,496
Rym: No.

652
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:47,980
Scott: Nice.

653
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:48,429
Scott: Yeah.

654
00:35:48,821 --> 00:35:49,280
Scott: Nice, okay.

655
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,677
Rym: So there's only two ways the show can go.

656
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:55,400
Rym: Either the number goes up and down every episode based on what happens.

657
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,999
Scott: It's only gone up as far as I can tell.

658
00:35:57,581 --> 00:36:02,918
Rym: Or the number keeps going up and then if it keeps going up, there's only two ways the show can go.

659
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:10,120
Rym: Either it never hits 100 in the show until the very end or it hits it halfway through and the show goes way off the rails.

660
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,735
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, it's like.

661
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:13,960
Scott: you know he's going to explode when it hits 100.

662
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,000
Scott: They, like, reveal that right away.

663
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,054
Scott: It's not like some mystery, like, "What happens when it hits

664
00:36:17,054 --> 00:36:17,460
Scott: 100?"

665
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:17,588
Scott: Right?

666
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,800
Scott: It's like in the title of the show is the number 100.

667
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,559
Scott: They show you the number.

668
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,540
Scott: They show you it hitting 100 and exploding.

669
00:36:24,108 --> 00:36:27,920
Scott: So it's just like, when and where is he going to be at that point?

670
00:36:28,222 --> 00:36:33,979
Scott: and what does the explosion mean in the real world versus, like, the spirit world where it just killed all the bad guys near him.

671
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:38,900
Rym: Yep, and we already know from the first episode that all these spirits are legit dangerous to regular people.

672
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,250
Rym: Yeah.

673
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:45,779
Scott: I mean, some of them are more good or evil, but they're all really powerful and dangerous and are totally real.

674
00:36:46,221 --> 00:36:51,139
Rym: And I like his sidekick because basically there's this other guy who pretends to be a sidekick.

675
00:36:52,201 --> 00:36:59,393
Scott: It's like they tell you that Mob is the protagonist of this show, but based on episode one, he's not.

676
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,879
Scott: It's really this other guy.

677
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,060
Rym: And the other guy is a sidekick investigator.

678
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,339
Scott: What's his name?

679
00:37:05,764 --> 00:37:06,500
Rym: I don't even remember.

680
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,100
Scott: I don't remember.

681
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,220
Rym: But he sucks.

682
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,978
Scott: Is it Reigen or something like that?

683
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:10,780
Scott: Something like that.

684
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:11,399
Scott: I could be wrong.

685
00:37:12,267 --> 00:37:12,759
Scott: Probably wrong.

686
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,500
Rym: He either is not sidekick or is barely sidekick.

687
00:37:16,841 --> 00:37:20,720
Rym: What was the guy in Gatekeepers who didn't have any powers?

688
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,300
Scott: I don't know, but basically he's just a con artist.

689
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,579
Scott: And you know what?

690
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,640
Rym: He's sort of a con artist, but at the same time, he knows this shit is real.

691
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:31,239
Rym: Like this is a world where there's a Uri Geller type who's totally faking it.

692
00:37:31,661 --> 00:37:34,379
Rym: But demons and spirits are real.

693
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,360
Rym: He does know that.

694
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,040
Scott: So he has knowledge, right?

695
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,120
Scott: He's not stupid.

696
00:37:39,661 --> 00:37:42,800
Scott: He's just sort of mildly malicious, right?

697
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,738
Scott: It's like he does.

698
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,500
Rym: He's just trying to make a buck in this crazy world.

699
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,700
Scott: He's trying to make money, but he's not completely a coward.

700
00:37:50,022 --> 00:37:53,420
Scott: He goes in and throws salt ineffectively at these monsters.

701
00:37:53,601 --> 00:37:55,979
Rym: I love when he's like, "Now I'll

702
00:37:55,999 --> 00:37:56,180
Rym: attack."

703
00:37:56,261 --> 00:37:59,180
Rym: And he does his special attack and it does the fist of the North Star cutaway.

704
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,480
Scott: I mean, he is somewhat cowardly.

705
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,715
Scott: He's like, "Hey, you go fight this

706
00:38:01,755 --> 00:38:02,140
Scott: monster.".

707
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:04,840
Scott: But he's not completely cowardly, like he's running away and shit.

708
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,520
Rym: Well, like when the kid throws up the shield and defeats the boss demon.

709
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,078
Rym: And I like how the demon was just a boss.

710
00:38:09,543 --> 00:38:10,300
Scott: He's the boss.

711
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,060
Rym: But right there, he realizes immediately how the kid put up the shield.

712
00:38:14,521 --> 00:38:17,240
Rym: And then he just totally acts like a super badass in front of the demon.

713
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,716
Rym: Like, "Yeah, don't fuck with

714
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:18,877
Rym: me.".

715
00:38:19,181 --> 00:38:20,007
Scott: And he's not 100% evil.

716
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,479
Scott: He's ripping people off and making them pay him a bunch of money.

717
00:38:24,781 --> 00:38:26,080
Scott: But he is actually trying to fight the demons.

718
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,120
Scott: And giving the kid only a little bit of money.

719
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,000
Scott: Probably when the kid deserves more of the money.

720
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,659
Rym: He's doing what any corporation would do.

721
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,880
Scott: But he is legitimately trying to go and help.

722
00:38:35,561 --> 00:38:38,160
Scott: He wants to get rid of the demons and help the people.

723
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,339
Scott: And also what he's selling.

724
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,160
Scott: And he's also being really comedic.

725
00:38:42,747 --> 00:38:43,360
Scott: It's weird, right?

726
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,940
Scott: Because you know how I always complain about that character?

727
00:38:46,986 --> 00:38:49,500
Scott: My example is always the John Goodman from Big Lebowski.

728
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:53,837
Scott: Where it's like that guy who's just so... You know, and it's like that's...

729
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,560
Rym: Like if they were real and in the room with you, you would want to stab them in the throat.

730
00:38:57,681 --> 00:38:59,159
Scott: It's like they just need to be stabbed in the throat.

731
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,520
Scott: This guy is really weird.

732
00:39:01,921 --> 00:39:04,900
Scott: Because this character of this guy, he's half that.

733
00:39:05,502 --> 00:39:06,939
Scott: But he's half actually funny.

734
00:39:07,206 --> 00:39:07,399
Scott: Yeah.

735
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:14,020
Scott: It's like usually the characters in comedies these days are 100% that guy that I can't stand and it's not funny.

736
00:39:14,504 --> 00:39:21,657
Scott: But this guy, he's only... Like half the time I'm like... Like when he's ripping... When he's hitting the kid like a few hundred yens, I'm like, "Oh you

737
00:39:21,698 --> 00:39:22,060
Scott: motherfucker.".

738
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,220
Scott: But then, he does something actually funny.

739
00:39:25,481 --> 00:39:25,836
Rym: And I'm like...

740
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:29,240
Scott: So I only half hate him and half like him.

741
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,737
Rym: But I love his attack because he's like, "My whatever salt

742
00:39:31,758 --> 00:39:32,040
Rym: attack.".

743
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,976
Rym: And then it's like, "That was one of his special

744
00:39:34,016 --> 00:39:34,339
Rym: attacks.".

745
00:39:34,561 --> 00:39:37,080
Rym: He just violently throws salt all around.

746
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,239
Scott: Now here's the thing that I thought was really... I actually laughed at a lot.

747
00:39:40,381 --> 00:39:43,813
Scott: Is that the first Spirit guy is like, "It only works if you have purified

748
00:39:43,854 --> 00:39:44,056
Scott: salt.".

749
00:39:44,804 --> 00:39:45,799
Scott: Not grocery store salt.

750
00:39:46,661 --> 00:39:50,967
Scott: And then it was funny again because he does like a salt punch where he fills his fist with... And the demon is like,

751
00:39:50,987 --> 00:39:51,109
Scott: "Ahh!"

752
00:39:52,407 --> 00:39:52,975
Scott: "Oh, that didn't

753
00:39:53,036 --> 00:39:53,158
Scott: hurt.".

754
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:58,960
Scott: But the thing is... Why didn't he just go get some purified... If purified salt works, why don't you get some purified salt?

755
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,674
Rym: Because he kind of sucks.

756
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,379
Scott: Get some purified salt.

757
00:40:02,821 --> 00:40:05,559
Scott: If you were just told that it works, why don't you get some?

758
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:08,536
Scott: But he's basically conning Mob also.

759
00:40:09,161 --> 00:40:13,140
Scott: And it's like you can't tell... Mob isn't stupid, but he is.

760
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,740
Scott: He has bad grades in school and shit.

761
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,959
Scott: He's not that smart.

762
00:40:16,462 --> 00:40:18,440
Rym: He's like below average at everything.

763
00:40:18,881 --> 00:40:22,620
Scott: He's bad at school, but that doesn't... But he's not stupid.

764
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,959
Rym: He's not a stupid person.

765
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,379
Scott: He's just not good at school.

766
00:40:25,761 --> 00:40:29,420
Scott: So does he realize he's being conned or not?

767
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:30,615
Scott: It's like...

768
00:40:31,445 --> 00:40:32,820
Rym: Is Avash the stampede thing?

769
00:40:33,042 --> 00:40:34,438
Rym: Does he know what he's doing?

770
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,279
Scott: Is he doing this just because this guy will conveniently call him to where the spirits are?

771
00:40:38,522 --> 00:40:43,420
Rym: And also, I like how the guy... The guy's obviously acting like he knows way more than he does and that he's a super psychic.

772
00:40:43,561 --> 00:40:44,239
Scott: But he knows stuff.

773
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:48,700
Rym: Yeah, but he acts like the kid will point things out where he's wrong.

774
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:57,200
Rym: And he is legit good as a character, in character, at deflecting that the way that, say, I would if I was lying to someone.

775
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,320
Scott: I was just about to say, Rym style, and that's the half of him that I hate.

776
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,097
Rym: But it works!

777
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:01,840
Scott: That's the hateful half.

778
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:05,800
Rym: Usually when a show does something like that, it's not like no one would fall for that shit.

779
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,420
Rym: But he does it right.

780
00:41:07,642 --> 00:41:09,960
Rym: He's lying the way a real liar would lie.

781
00:41:10,421 --> 00:41:15,340
Scott: Yeah, he has... He has some chrismas and powers of some kind.

782
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:19,740
Scott: He's not just this completely useless guy who's just like an annoying leech, right?

783
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,019
Scott: He has some use.

784
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,380
Rym: And also, you know, he's not actually even ripping off the people he's selling to, because he's very clear.

785
00:41:26,881 --> 00:41:28,660
Rym: For this small fee, he doesn't charge a lot.

786
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:34,099
Rym: He'll reduce the spirit activity by some percent, and like 20% is the best he can hope for.

787
00:41:36,143 --> 00:41:39,740
Rym: I'll bet that his service before he had Mob was about that effective.

788
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:52,540
Scott: Well, I think what he does a lot that they sort of imply but don't show is that people come in to his business, and their problem isn't actually a spirit, and he pretends to beat the spirit and takes their money and rips them off.

789
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,480
Scott: And he only calls Mob when he shows up at the scene, and there actually are real spirits there.

790
00:41:57,525 --> 00:41:58,980
Scott: So that's his evil part, right?

791
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:00,300
Rym: Because it might also be that...

792
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,879
Scott: He basically just sells nonsense to people.

793
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,877
Rym: Because when the monsters come, he's just like, "Well, there's

794
00:42:05,038 --> 00:42:05,139
Rym: one.".

795
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:09,020
Scott: Like, imagine if the Ghostbusters show up, and there's a Slimer there.

796
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,999
Scott: So they fucking catch it, and they charge you money.

797
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:18,160
Scott: But if you call them and you just think there's a ghost and there's a loud noise, imagine if they put on an act where they caught a ghost and then took your money.

798
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,100
Scott: That's what this guy does in his spirit.

799
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,080
Scott: You know, he just doesn't call Mob for those jobs.

800
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,809
Scott: Now, the animation is great.

801
00:42:24,889 --> 00:42:26,680
Rym: Like, the fighting and the monsters and everything.

802
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,340
Rym: Like, I like this show a lot, and it was legit funny.

803
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:31,260
Scott: It's modern, good, decent animations.

804
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,680
Scott: I think the best part about it, like I already said, though, is the character designs, especially on the monsters.

805
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,906
Rym: Yeah, but also the people.

806
00:42:36,926 --> 00:42:39,380
Rym: Like, I'm looking at Crunchyroll the rest of the episodes.

807
00:42:40,142 --> 00:42:42,120
Rym: Like, there's Milhouse, just has a blockhead.

808
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,900
Scott: Yeah, it's the designs and also the expressions.

809
00:42:46,121 --> 00:42:49,380
Scott: But the actual drawing quality is... it's okay.

810
00:42:50,044 --> 00:42:51,080
Rym: It's above average, I'd say.

811
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:51,686
Rym: It's modern.

812
00:42:51,808 --> 00:42:52,900
Scott: I mean, yeah, average is bad.

813
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,160
Rym: The color scheme and the action is really well done.

814
00:42:56,382 --> 00:42:56,900
Scott: Yeah, it's alright.

815
00:42:57,981 --> 00:42:59,280
Scott: It's not a fucking masterpiece.

816
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:05,160
Rym: I'm gonna watch a bunch more episodes, and if it stays good through the first four, then I'm just gonna watch the whole thing.

817
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,530
Scott: It's like, I could watch more.

818
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:11,560
Scott: I wouldn't mind watching more, but I don't have a super strong... I only have a slight desire to watch more, right?

819
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:16,692
Scott: Like, I kinda wanna watch more, but if there's like five shows to watch, it's not gonna jump the queue or anything.

820
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,540
Rym: I had a pretty strong desire to watch episode two just because I laughed a lot at episode one.

821
00:43:22,761 --> 00:43:31,519
Scott: Well, I have a slightly greater desire just to see episode two and maybe not three, because the preview for episode two made it seem like it wasn't gonna be a formulaic show.

822
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,780
Rym: Also, there are only twelve episodes.

823
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:34,483
Scott: Oh, that's good.

824
00:43:34,826 --> 00:43:36,419
Scott: So it felt like it was gonna be formulaic.

825
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,220
Scott: Like, each episode, there's a spirit and they deal with it, right?

826
00:43:39,762 --> 00:43:44,719
Scott: But if it breaks that formula and the episodes do something different, then I would wanna watch it a lot more.

827
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,220
Rym: I mean, the next episode is doubts about youth.

828
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,839
Rym: Episode four is idiots only event.

829
00:43:51,603 --> 00:43:53,119
Rym: There's a cult or something.

830
00:43:55,949 --> 00:43:57,320
Rym: Yeah, it looks like it escalates.

831
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:03,900
Scott: Right, so I guess being written by the one-punch guy, you sorta have to compare it to one-punch man, because there are some similarities, right?

832
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,820
Rym: I mean, the kid is a one-punch psychic.

833
00:44:06,121 --> 00:44:10,600
Scott: Right, the kid is one-punch... He's basically one-punching the spirits.

834
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,699
Scott: He's so strong, the spirits can't even compete with him, right?

835
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:28,820
Scott: But, even though you have this really powerful character who's kinda quiet, the fact that he's so powerful isn't, you know, a plot point, isn't the key motivation, the way one-punch man's, you know, Cy Thomas' key motivation is the fact that he's so powerful, right?

836
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:42,579
Scott: And also, you know, the Genos character, you know, the secondary character in one-punch man, it's like, you know, he's got a thing going on, but he's less of a character than the con artist in Mob Psycho is.

837
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:43,440
Rym: Yeah.

838
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:52,400
Scott: You know, Mob Psycho really is the sort of duality of these two characters, whereas one-punch man is like Cy Thomas and Genos is definitely a second fiddle.

839
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,619
Scott: This is two equal fiddles going on.

840
00:44:55,962 --> 00:44:56,030
Rym: Yup.

841
00:44:56,581 --> 00:44:59,520
Rym: So I'm gonna give the show a big chance and I'll keep watching it until I get bored.

842
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,719
Rym: Twelve episodes, I'll probably watch the whole thing.

843
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:02,140
Rym: Yeah,

844
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:21,023
Scott: I don't wanna say this is, I can't say yet that this is a must-watch scenario, but it's like, look, this anime season is pretty bad, so if you've already seen all the old animes and you wanna watch a new anime, this is the newest anime I've seen that I haven't seen all of that, you know, I

845
00:45:21,748 --> 00:45:23,420
Rym: haven't already told you to watch.

846
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:30,737
Scott: Yeah, like, of the new animes that I have not seen all of, this is the newest and best yet, so why not?

847
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,539
Scott: Twelve episodes, whatever.

848
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,299
Rym: Yup, I got the C-rollo watching.

849
00:45:40,531 --> 00:45:42,670
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

850
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:47,810
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:56,150
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

859
00:46:55,723 --> 00:46:59,480
Rym: I know I'm going to be in Australia, but don't worry, I'm going to be making a bunch of content while I'm there.

860
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:04,020
Rym: I'm going to try to queue up a bunch of stuff to release while I'm there, while I'm still here in the States.

861
00:47:04,761 --> 00:47:08,840
Rym: And after that, then things will calm down again through the holidays, and we're going to keep trying to make more content.

862
00:47:09,841 --> 00:47:13,140
Rym: A bunch of the Patreon things are going to start coming out and increasing frequency.

863
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:18,258
Rym: And don't forget that I'm reading all of Castlevania 2, the novelization Simon's Quest by FX9.

864
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,318
Rym: But anyway, now I leave you with this.

865
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:22,133
Rym: Wake up!

866
00:47:46,222 --> 00:47:48,578
Scott: So let's just say...

867
00:47:52,962 --> 00:47:57,298
Rym: Oh, well I hate to be a bummer, I brought you here to bring me... How about you know those brothers?

868
00:47:58,263 --> 00:47:59,257
Rym: Oh, it's their names.

869
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:03,719
Rym: Oh yes, Mario and Luigi, just the sound of them makes me queasy, I love them.

870
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,319
Rym: Take that monkey wrench, I'll play my own game.

871
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:07,797
Rym: Princess Toad!

872
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,518
Rym: You're so misguided!

873
00:48:14,401 --> 00:48:18,240
Scott: I've never been found the one who's a faggot, and this one does make good Mario weight!

874
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,059
Rym: Oh, I can't wait.

875
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,898
Rym: Ignorance is blessed.

876
00:48:24,561 --> 00:48:30,560
Rym: With my magic book I'll shower those clumsy lizards with my power until Dinosaur Land is nothing but fossil fuel.

877
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:38,420
Rym: My only problem with these spells is that I know not what they tell, so every hex leaves me perplexed and all I want are those plumbing fools.

878
00:48:38,742 --> 00:48:39,196
Rym: Princess Toad!

879
00:48:41,241 --> 00:48:42,797
Rym: You're not so clever!
