00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,107
Rym: Hey, it's Monday, August 10th.

00:00:30,963 --> 00:00:32,497
Rym: So this week sucks ass.

6
00:00:35,183 --> 00:00:37,040
Scott: How much ass does it suck?

7
00:00:37,522 --> 00:00:45,216
Rym: This is like the one week where I got to work the night shift like the European midnight to 9 a.m To train the guy who's gonna be actually working that shift.

8
00:00:45,256 --> 00:00:50,269
Rym: and let me tell you New York is the city that never sleeps Except at 4 in the morning.

9
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:52,101
Scott: Well, I mean, it's only sleeps at 4.

10
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:54,760
Scott: See the thing about New York City is that it's true that it doesn't sleep.

11
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:58,000
Scott: However, the thing is in New York City, there are many different neighborhood.

12
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,260
Rym: Oh, no, it's got no that I wandered around even took the subway down to other more half plate like happen in places.

13
00:01:03,842 --> 00:01:08,094
Rym: There's basically nothing going on except if you go far enough away from Midtown.

14
00:01:08,455 --> 00:01:10,080
Rym: There are one or two bodegas open.

15
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:11,805
Scott: Yeah, that's about it.

16
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:12,266
Scott: That's it.

17
00:01:12,327 --> 00:01:14,154
Scott: Midtown is an area where it's got.

18
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:16,644
Rym: I'm saying even if you leave Midtown There's nothing going on.

19
00:01:16,684 --> 00:01:18,431
Scott: a for gotta go to the residential places.

20
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:19,215
Scott: I live.

21
00:01:19,356 --> 00:01:20,340
Rym: even if you go to those places.

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,627
Rym: There's not that much going on except a couple of bodegas.

23
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:25,958
Rym: one McDonald's this 24/7, but I learned something else.

24
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:30,051
Rym: Mm-hmm McDonald's doesn't even serve breakfast at 4 a.m Uh-huh.

25
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:32,138
Rym: They don't start that until 530.

26
00:01:32,138 --> 00:01:32,680
Scott: You got to go.

27
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:37,256
Scott: There are places just got to know where they are, but it is true that most shit closes.

28
00:01:37,316 --> 00:01:48,173
Rym: people got to sleep, man I guess there are bars that might be open Yeah, but it was amazing to walk around the city and there were a lot of people walking around But nothing was open but at 4 in the morning.

29
00:01:48,193 --> 00:01:52,046
Rym: Yeah when I went to lunch Wow, I just wandered outside.

30
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:54,960
Rym: I wanted to see what it was, you know, I never get to hang out in Midtown that late.

31
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,956
Scott: Yeah, that's that's like a lot of people, huh?

32
00:01:57,956 --> 00:01:58,077
Scott: 4 a.m.

33
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:06,611
Rym: Well, the weird thing is a lot of people took the train in in the more like a midnight yesterday And a lot of people took the train out at 9 a.m.

34
00:02:06,652 --> 00:02:08,500
Scott: But it was a must be a lot of night workers.

35
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,527
Rym: No, it wasn't workers.

36
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:10,798
Rym: It was all like families.

37
00:02:11,622 --> 00:02:21,800
Rym: It was all like mom and kids but not that many guys and there were a lot of weird people on the train going in the Opposite direction a lot of loud people having weird conversations.

38
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:23,303
Scott: Very strange.

39
00:02:23,323 --> 00:02:24,890
Rym: This whole experience is just surreal.

40
00:02:25,352 --> 00:02:27,523
Scott: Well, you're only gonna have to suffer it for a week It'd be.

41
00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:29,200
Scott: it'd be weird if it was surreal every day.

42
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,427
Scott: Eventually, the surreal would become non surreal.

43
00:02:31,447 --> 00:02:35,580
Scott: and then when you had to like the city in a normal hour you'd be like what the fuck?

44
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,723
Rym: It's just crazy.

45
00:02:36,964 --> 00:02:37,346
Scott: Yeah.

46
00:02:37,787 --> 00:02:41,020
Scott: Well, it's always stuff like that's always cool in small doses though.

47
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:45,620
Rym: Yeah, the thing is I I'm tired partly, you know, I was gonna get some sleep this morning.

48
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,507
Rym: You know, I come home at like 10 a.m.

49
00:02:47,527 --> 00:02:51,180
Rym: And then go to sleep except that the power went out like three times.

50
00:02:51,782 --> 00:02:52,624
Scott: Yeah, I came home.

51
00:02:52,664 --> 00:02:55,975
Scott: I saw that immediately all the clocks were off by like four hours.

52
00:02:56,517 --> 00:02:58,904
Scott: Yeah computer was off The hallway computer was off.

53
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:00,650
Rym: I'm asleep and the power goes out.

54
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:06,127
Rym: So I get woken up by the UPS streaking and no AC Nothing to do and it's hot.

55
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:08,936
Rym: So I open the windows and I turn on my fan.

56
00:03:09,277 --> 00:03:10,240
Scott: It's hot as hell.

57
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,104
Rym: I turn on my fan.

58
00:03:12,124 --> 00:03:16,077
Rym: Yeah still well fan didn't do anything cuz there's no power.

59
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:21,386
Scott: Oh fuck Spritz yourself with some water.

60
00:03:21,406 --> 00:03:22,752
Rym: I just stood in the shower.

61
00:03:22,773 --> 00:03:25,451
Rym: I Did that way back?

62
00:03:25,653 --> 00:03:26,199
Rym: I was water.

63
00:03:26,682 --> 00:03:33,153
Rym: I was at the University of Michigan at this like marching band thing and I went by myself because it was sort of this like honors thing.

64
00:03:33,173 --> 00:03:43,019
Rym: We had to apply for it and Stupidly I listened to knitter by instructor and I applied for this thing and I got in and then I learned that no one Else applied for it because it sucks.

65
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:51,099
Rym: So I get there and it's super hard and everyone's a jerk and I'm like the only person from my school and it's like a million degrees.

66
00:03:52,400 --> 00:04:06,416
Rym: Wow, as I was walking out of the showers to go to bed in this on air-conditioned alcohol I see a guy who has pulled a chair into the shower Set it on a low cold trickle and it's just sleeping under it and you copied him.

67
00:04:06,797 --> 00:04:07,720
Rym: I did the same thing.

68
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,832
Rym: I didn't stay there all night, but I laid there for a while.

69
00:04:09,852 --> 00:04:10,516
Scott: You said they're all night.

70
00:04:10,536 --> 00:04:11,220
Scott: You might in sick.

71
00:04:13,425 --> 00:04:14,340
Scott: Well, it'll be interesting.

72
00:04:14,903 --> 00:04:17,055
Scott: We'll see what happens and we'll definitely learn.

73
00:04:17,096 --> 00:04:17,600
Rym: they die.

74
00:04:18,002 --> 00:04:21,577
Scott: You'll learn lots of things and I will learn them by proxy hurray.

75
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:27,699
Rym: for me What I've learned pretty much is that no amount of money no amount of money could make me do this shift.

76
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:32,864
Rym: Yeah, there's nothing in the world that could make me work midnight tonight I think is you there's?

77
00:04:32,884 --> 00:04:36,639
Scott: that's not true because what if someone gave you like a billion dollars for like a week?

78
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:40,528
Scott: you would Do it for a week and then you'd be like, so Well, let me put it this way.

79
00:04:40,588 --> 00:04:41,433
Rym: No reason.

80
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:47,314
Rym: you quit and you'd you know I know reasonable amount of money and - I would not do it for more than about a week.

81
00:04:47,756 --> 00:04:50,992
Rym: half a million dollars a year I don't know wouldn't be worth it.

82
00:04:51,072 --> 00:04:52,320
Scott: a million dollars a year.

83
00:04:53,282 --> 00:04:57,073
Rym: Give me one million dollars a year of my life is not worth that.

84
00:04:57,414 --> 00:04:59,299
Scott: two million dollars worth it.

85
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,005
Scott: million now Really five million.

86
00:05:03,025 --> 00:05:05,757
Scott: I would not basically work one year and never have to work again.

87
00:05:05,777 --> 00:05:06,420
Rym: I wouldn't do it.

88
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,463
Scott: That's like baseball player.

89
00:05:07,523 --> 00:05:08,767
Rym: You you try this shift.

90
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:10,112
Rym: It's not fun.

91
00:05:10,132 --> 00:05:15,600
Scott: I know but for five million dollars I do it for one year and then the rest of my life do it ever the hell I want it.

92
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,280
Scott: It'd be totally worth.

93
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:16,602
Rym: I don't know.

94
00:05:16,723 --> 00:05:19,438
Rym: one entire year of kind of when I'm still at by one of my.

95
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:23,420
Rym: you know The physical prime of my life is not worth five million dollars because I can't get that back.

96
00:05:23,743 --> 00:05:33,340
Scott: I can make five million dollars some other way Maybe but I could live in the luxury Manhattan apartment dirty if I got paid that much money while I and I'd basically just walk Down there at night and oh man.

97
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,419
Rym: But then you wouldn't have that much money left at the end of the thing to show for it.

98
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,279
Scott: I would cuz I would I wouldn't spend the money like a dumbass.

99
00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:42,873
Scott: The luxury Manhattan apartment is only could only be like three thousand a month.

100
00:05:42,894 --> 00:05:44,480
Rym: So that's why it's a lot more than that.

101
00:05:44,962 --> 00:05:47,593
Scott: Well for a small yet luxury apartment.

102
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:49,200
Scott: I saw some that were only three thousand.

103
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:50,927
Rym: Anyway, I don't know about luxury.

104
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:52,614
Rym: You're you're thinking luxury in the.

105
00:05:52,795 --> 00:05:53,377
Scott: I'm not talking.

106
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:55,626
Rym: I'm not talking Person luxury.

107
00:05:55,686 --> 00:05:56,991
Scott: I'm talking luxury as in.

108
00:05:57,372 --> 00:05:59,400
Scott: it's actually new and has a parking space.

109
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,484
Rym: Oh, no, you're talking luxury.

110
00:06:00,524 --> 00:06:04,959
Rym: Like when they say luxury apartments in the Bronx, they basically mean these aren't shit holes.

111
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:05,380
Rym: exactly.

112
00:06:06,882 --> 00:06:08,527
Scott: Exactly, you know, it's nice.

113
00:06:08,607 --> 00:06:12,417
Scott: It's clean, you know, it's got a modern appliances.

114
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:13,480
Scott: It's got a parking space.

115
00:06:14,201 --> 00:06:17,093
Scott: It's got you know a little enough room to sit and such.

116
00:06:17,595 --> 00:06:21,250
Rym: so that aside We should get right into this because I want to go to work.

117
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:22,596
Scott: So his is my news.

118
00:06:22,657 --> 00:06:23,139
Scott: I'll make it.

119
00:06:23,621 --> 00:06:25,034
Rym: Yeah, what do you got?

120
00:06:25,054 --> 00:06:25,680
Scott: So check this out?

121
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:36,538
Scott: I have this problem where I have a bank in Connecticut where I grew up and I spent you know 16 years of my life 17 years of my life, right and I just never changed banks and why should I?

122
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:41,682
Scott: it's just a lot of Work and there's not much benefit to it and I can use pretty much in any ATM I want.

123
00:06:42,064 --> 00:06:45,480
Scott: I have really good online banking all my direct deposits already set up.

124
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,164
Scott: So why should I change the bank?

125
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:47,445
Scott: Right?

126
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:53,262
Scott: The only time I ever actually need to go to my bank is if I need to deposit a Check.

127
00:06:53,363 --> 00:06:55,020
Scott: on a rare rare rare occasion.

128
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:01,148
Scott: Someone gives me a check and it's sort of annoying but I can just mail it home to my parents who still live in Connecticut and they deposit it.

129
00:07:01,732 --> 00:07:07,200
Scott: but this one bank Came up with a solution and the solution is very so simple and so obvious.

130
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,225
Scott: I hope my bank does it.

131
00:07:08,908 --> 00:07:11,660
Scott: you take a picture of your check with your phone, right?

132
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:20,332
Scott: I guess both sides of the check I assume and then you void the check and then they take care of it and Of course, they won't let just anyone do this, right?

133
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:28,099
Scott: You have to be like not a schmuck You know, like if you got lots of debts and shit and you're not don't have good credit They won't let you do this because you'll probably fraud them and whatnot.

134
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:32,876
Scott: But you know if you're not defrauding anyone and you check out and you've got you know money.

135
00:07:33,257 --> 00:07:33,980
Scott: they let you do it.

136
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,067
Scott: It's totally cool.

137
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,879
Rym: I just wish I didn't have to use checks at all.

138
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:42,200
Scott: I know checks are so old and like they're totally that there's no reason to have them anymore.

139
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,960
Scott: People should be able to exchange money directly with each other and a card slash PayPal fashion without fees.

140
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:55,454
Rym: It's partly the bank's problems in that You know my bank just won't wire money to people without all this hassle.

141
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:57,140
Rym: like wiring money is such a pain in the ass.

142
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:09,310
Scott: Yeah, I should be able to go to a website type in my friend's number that he gives me some public You know a secure number right and then give him an arbitrary amount of money at no cost Directly from my checking account to his checking account.

143
00:08:09,732 --> 00:08:11,560
Scott: and I shouldn't need to pay PayPal a fee.

144
00:08:11,962 --> 00:08:13,390
Scott: I shouldn't need to pay the bank a fee.

145
00:08:13,852 --> 00:08:15,119
Scott: I'm just giving someone money.

146
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,509
Scott: It's basically just some bits have to move.

147
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:18,414
Scott: It's like a text message.

148
00:08:18,434 --> 00:08:23,900
Rym: It doesn't cost anything Right, so no, it does actually cost something in terms of you know, but there one.

149
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,468
Rym: There's a lot of regulatory stuff about tracking where money goes.

150
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,351
Scott: Yeah.

151
00:08:28,013 --> 00:08:30,200
Scott: Yeah, it's in a database one record in a database.

152
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,120
Rym: No, it costs money to have people to kind of maintain all that and watch it and to file all the paperwork.

153
00:08:35,861 --> 00:08:38,238
Scott: That's the cost I pay just having a bank account.

154
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:40,669
Rym: in general You don't pay anything to have a bank account, huh?

155
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,458
Scott: But it cost something to have a bank account, doesn't it?

156
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,784
Rym: No, it doesn't see.

157
00:08:43,864 --> 00:08:48,580
Scott: the bank makes its money because they're holding on to my money investing it and reaping rewards from it.

158
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,604
Scott: That's where they get paid.

159
00:08:49,865 --> 00:08:50,729
Scott: So they shouldn't pay me.

160
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,111
Scott: They should.

161
00:08:51,151 --> 00:08:53,200
Scott: I shouldn't have to pay them fees to do stuff.

162
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:55,400
Scott: I think the real getting paid by having my money.

163
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,461
Rym: I think the real problem is that the vast majority of people don't even like they would never even care about us or something like That.

164
00:09:00,501 --> 00:09:01,245
Rym: so it'll never happen.

165
00:09:01,466 --> 00:09:04,580
Scott: I think a lot of people would like it a lot not enough people for to matter.

166
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:08,360
Rym: I mean no bank is going to do it and then all the other banks are gonna follow suit or that's true.

167
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,785
Scott: But I think this bank is doing it and if it helps, you know I think slowly but surely banks will be sort of just.

168
00:09:14,106 --> 00:09:19,909
Scott: it's gonna be slow but more stuff like this will happen and then eventually what I just said will Happen and then it'll be a good day.

169
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:26,900
Rym: I don't think it'll be anytime soon though, really It's gonna take a while maybe 10 years because remember we still have to interface with people who just don't get it.

170
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,174
Rym: I mean, I still have to write checks to my stupid landlord.

171
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,160
Scott: I know right.

172
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,920
Scott: Hopefully in the city, I'll find a landlord who can just like directly take the money.

173
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,624
Rym: That's the what.

174
00:09:35,664 --> 00:09:41,019
Rym: the biggest thing I'm looking forward to more and more about buying a house Is that I can just have that taken care of because I can.

175
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,920
Scott: Why is the bank in the bank and just take care of itself?

176
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,160
Rym: Well, I also you know have an escrow account set up for all the taxes and everything else.

177
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:51,019
Rym: I basically won't have to ever do anything unless I've run out of money.

178
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:54,417
Scott: No, that's yeah, but I mean if you just run out of money, you still won't have to do anything.

179
00:09:54,457 --> 00:09:59,854
Rym: It's a runaway All right, so I'd like to talk at least a little bit about prank net.

180
00:09:59,874 --> 00:10:03,832
Rym: now you could argue if this is a Monday or A Thursday is some sort of 4chan derivative.

181
00:10:04,335 --> 00:10:13,200
Rym: No, okay Prank net is that thing where basically people were calling other people and convincing to do dangerous stupid destructive things.

182
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,386
Rym: Hey, you're in a hotel, right?

183
00:10:16,427 --> 00:10:20,080
Rym: Well, there's snakes and if you don't break the windows blah blah blah you might die.

184
00:10:20,341 --> 00:10:26,304
Scott: See I heard about this right the other day and I thought about it for a little while and the first thing you think Of course is wow.

185
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:28,572
Scott: These people are stupid doing what they're told over the phone.

186
00:10:28,652 --> 00:10:30,920
Rym: No, I'd actually go one step further.

187
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:38,620
Rym: I blame society for instilling in people this kind of immediate and Automatic trust of anything that sounds like an authority, right?

188
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:44,860
Scott: So my the thing is, you know My first instinct here is to blame the people who are on the receiving end of the prank, right?

189
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:47,756
Scott: But I thought about it a little bit more and you know what.

190
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:53,338
Scott: actually Even though I am NOT going to disagree that those people are morons and it's society's fault, etc, etc.

191
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,569
Scott: I do think the people pulling the prank should go to jail.

192
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:59,536
Scott: You know, why Al Capone?

193
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:01,222
Rym: No, not Al Capone That's.

194
00:11:01,242 --> 00:11:02,250
Rym: that's how they're gonna get him though.

195
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,620
Scott: That's probably how they're gonna get him.

196
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,065
Scott: You know what?

197
00:11:04,146 --> 00:11:06,682
Scott: I think is the problem here Some of it?

198
00:11:06,783 --> 00:11:08,590
Scott: look at the descriptions of some of the pranks.

199
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,469
Scott: they're pulling right like they called someone up on the phone and they're Like yeah, there's a toxic gas leak.

200
00:11:12,489 --> 00:11:14,320
Scott: You need to jump out the window of your hotel room, right?

201
00:11:14,762 --> 00:11:15,474
Scott: You know what that is?

202
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:24,074
Scott: That's shouting fire in the crowded theater the thing that you're not allowed to do that Even the free speech crazies like us say you're not allowed to do.

203
00:11:24,115 --> 00:11:25,401
Scott: and here's the thing I mean.

204
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:28,880
Scott: therefore I think the pranking people are definitely definitely bad.

205
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,206
Scott: These are yelling fire in the crowded.

206
00:11:30,246 --> 00:11:33,340
Rym: these tire iron pranks were across like they're all over the place.

207
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:40,260
Rym: And what is the line between shouting fire and simply, you know, convincing someone stupid to do something stupid?

208
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:40,421
Rym: I

209
00:11:40,461 --> 00:12:00,460
Scott: think you would have to definitely judge that based on the individual phone call because some of not all the phone calls were oh My god, there's a toxic gas leak, you know, some of the phone calls were like something else And depending on what they actually said on the call, I'm sure hotels record the calls I don't know what they do, but you know, depending on the evidence and all that you'd have to make a decision.

210
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:08,913
Scott: I'm sure some of the pranks were shouting fire in a crowded theater and some of them were probably not and That's up to the court and the jury and such to decide.

211
00:12:09,054 --> 00:12:22,526
Rym: not what I find interesting is that one these were some relatively unsophisticated people and all the reports are that the guy who was kind of running this is literally some loser who lives in his mom's basement and Kind of a loner no job.

212
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:34,423
Scott: Just like he's such a stereotype of that kind of loser I think that we could actually Probably help society out a lot if we had some sort of law that just gets people out of their mom's Basements.

213
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,093
Scott: like you can't live with your mom.

214
00:12:36,113 --> 00:12:37,039
Scott: You got to get your ass out.

215
00:12:37,461 --> 00:12:37,964
Rym: Why not though?

216
00:12:38,005 --> 00:12:42,052
Rym: because a lot of people use that to a great advantage, you know Just out of college got a lot of student loans.

217
00:12:42,092 --> 00:12:43,019
Rym: live with mom for a couple

218
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:50,472
Scott: years You know, but maybe we need some sort of you know System to like find these, you know If we find out that someone's living with their mom after X years

219
00:12:50,512 --> 00:12:53,006
Rym: and they shouldn't have the freedom to live that kind of life No,

220
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:56,230
Scott: but we should actually, you know We should check them out to make sure it's not a crazy.

221
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:02,120
Rym: and so you're gonna you want to spend more money on some sort Of social services program to find the 25 year old living in his mom's basement.

222
00:13:02,703 --> 00:13:06,905
Scott: Yeah, they probably need some help those people and they're very dangerous Scott are we?

223
00:13:07,045 --> 00:13:08,752
Rym: our child services can't even help.

224
00:13:08,912 --> 00:13:17,823
Rym: actual kids are getting beaten that well We need to help them - you're gonna help the 28 year old while playing basement dweller get away from Wow And orders my.

225
00:13:17,843 --> 00:13:20,313
Scott: ideally we would help them all but you know, we suck is?

226
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,120
Scott: it's the reality versus the ideal.

227
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,805
Scott: I'm just saying ideally we should help them.

228
00:13:23,825 --> 00:13:25,430
Scott: Well, that's saying realistically we can.

229
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:31,811
Rym: I do feel that the culpability is about 50/50 between the People inducing these people to do the crimes and the people doing the crimes.

230
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:37,679
Rym: but the thing about prank net that's interesting Is that this was basically just some piece some very?

231
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,280
Rym: Unsophisticated people pulling pranks.

232
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:57,911
Rym: I'm very surprised that something like this has not happened on a more organized scale because smart people You know the 4chan II anonymous types or even people like us could basically pull this off on a global scale without any Think about gloom and doom right lately.

233
00:13:57,951 --> 00:14:00,120
Scott: I mean this has been the week of stuff happening.

234
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,738
Scott: There was all those DDoS is that were real big on Twitter and everybody, right?

235
00:14:04,382 --> 00:14:06,273
Scott: There's all this stuff that can totally.

236
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:07,460
Scott: we're so vulnerable.

237
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:11,200
Scott: It's basically like you're just a duck sort of flying slowly across the marsh.

238
00:14:11,481 --> 00:14:15,000
Scott: It's like a hundred Elmer Fudd's and that ducks just ain't shot yet, right?

239
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,602
Rym: It's not.

240
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:19,174
Rym: it's that there are always Elmer Fudd's and there were always guns laying around.

241
00:14:19,215 --> 00:14:25,500
Rym: but it just recently We're having the ratio of Elmer Fudd's two guns is getting to a dangerous level.

242
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:27,025
Scott: Yeah, and it's just it's still.

243
00:14:27,145 --> 00:14:31,900
Scott: I'm so surprised that like oh the worst we've had is a DDoS in this prank net.

244
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:40,480
Scott: We haven't had like, you know, just like fires and riots in the streets coinciding with well the thing, you know Everyone's hard drive getting erased.

245
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:55,040
Rym: The lucky thing is that most of the people who are smart and sophisticated enough to do these things the way smart people would do them Either are not evil people or there aren't enough of those people with a common goal to organize anything that big.

246
00:14:55,126 --> 00:15:01,816
Rym: I mean There's one crazy who wants eggs and one crazy or wants why the two of them will not be able to easily Coordinate to get to.

247
00:15:01,836 --> 00:15:03,927
Rym: you know Do they're crazy in pursuit of both of their?

248
00:15:03,948 --> 00:15:06,880
Scott: so Marvel Comics is right and the supervillains can ever actually work together.

249
00:15:07,483 --> 00:15:14,418
Rym: I think they were in a degree except if you watch x-men the new one The supervillains were a lot of a lot smarter than the x-men were.

250
00:15:14,438 --> 00:15:18,125
Scott: yeah Heroes are never smart.

251
00:15:18,165 --> 00:15:21,680
Rym: They were just could have just called Magneto and said hey is professor X there.

252
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,531
Rym: He would have been like yeah found him naked and passed out.

253
00:15:24,571 --> 00:15:30,051
Scott: You guys want to pick him up, but no Right, why didn't Magneto call the x-men?

254
00:15:30,071 --> 00:15:32,258
Scott: should it be like hey, I just found Professor X all naked.

255
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:35,046
Scott: you want to come Right, you should have called the other.

256
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:35,448
Rym: You know what?

257
00:15:35,488 --> 00:15:38,520
Rym: He probably did and Wolverine just didn't check the fucking voicemail.

258
00:15:39,143 --> 00:15:42,359
Scott: Oh, well, you know, it's hard to check voice from all the danger and we can't really hear them.

259
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:50,590
Rym: Anyway, so things of the day.

260
00:15:50,891 --> 00:15:57,350
Rym: I'll admit that I very much like to watch computers masturbate and this is another example of that and it's very well done.

261
00:15:57,911 --> 00:16:12,436
Scott: So someone made a flash game that generates in real-time or semi real-time Super Mario World levels and so basically it just makes Super Mario World levels that are brand-new like totally You know not made by humans and you play them.

262
00:16:12,496 --> 00:16:12,697
Scott: Yep.

263
00:16:12,978 --> 00:16:13,299
Rym: So cool.

264
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:18,374
Rym: Someone else made a beat Super Mario World's AI Uh-huh.

265
00:16:18,735 --> 00:16:22,810
Scott: So this video beat any Super Mario World no matter what any beatable one at least.

266
00:16:23,251 --> 00:16:32,350
Rym: Wow, so someone put the two of these together and you can see the logic of kind of the thing charts out like all The pads and all the pads that are gonna die and the ones that aren't gonna die with red lines.

267
00:16:32,531 --> 00:16:32,692
Rym: It's.

268
00:16:32,832 --> 00:16:36,090
Scott: uh, can it do scrolling levels or only still love?

269
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:36,833
Rym: I have.

270
00:16:36,853 --> 00:16:39,630
Scott: no I did not scrolling levels means it just has to be real fast.

271
00:16:40,011 --> 00:16:43,444
Rym: I did not do any research whatsoever beyond watching this video.

272
00:16:43,664 --> 00:16:44,407
Scott: Okay, is that it?

273
00:16:44,548 --> 00:16:44,789
Scott: That's it.

274
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:47,700
Scott: So, you know Conway's game of life, of course.

275
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,162
Scott: Yeah.

276
00:16:48,182 --> 00:16:48,463
Scott: Yep.

277
00:16:48,523 --> 00:16:54,229
Scott: Somebody made a complete Computer constructor in Conway's game of life.

278
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:56,850
Scott: Wow, that's all I got to say.

279
00:16:57,111 --> 00:17:01,365
Rym: I remember like trying to make and gates and stuff like that in the game.

280
00:17:01,385 --> 00:17:02,830
Scott: They made a complete computer.

281
00:17:02,951 --> 00:17:06,650
Scott: So this can make basically process any program.

282
00:17:07,212 --> 00:17:11,483
Scott: So you might take a while might take a real long time, but you know, it's still.

283
00:17:11,525 --> 00:17:13,349
Scott: it's a complete computer as complete.

284
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:14,921
Scott: I don't know if it's Turing complete.

285
00:17:14,941 --> 00:17:18,970
Scott: I had to investigate further But you know, it's a computer in Conway's game alive.

286
00:17:19,411 --> 00:17:21,699
Scott: You can write programs for it and it will run them.

287
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,736
Rym: people seem to really like taking like look at the little big plant or anything like that.

288
00:17:26,776 --> 00:17:35,844
Rym: people like to take the machines or the physics of a made-up world and make Less efficient versions of real machines in them and it seems to be this huge hobby among geeks.

289
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:37,570
Scott: It's it's definitely cool.

290
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:44,549
Scott: I mean, you know, I totally love making computers out of anything that a computer can be made out of.

291
00:17:45,751 --> 00:17:53,142
Rym: So tonight we won't talk about this too long because there's not that much to say and we're not going to do a here Is how to do the things with this.

292
00:17:53,182 --> 00:17:54,570
Scott: but now you can read the man page.

293
00:17:54,590 --> 00:18:01,650
Rym: Yes, so SSH is possibly the most used most important and most useful tool that any computer person will ever use.

294
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,658
Scott: Yes, it's so surprising that it doesn't come with Windows.

295
00:18:04,678 --> 00:18:15,510
Scott: Yeah, it's so surprising that SSH the secure shell as it is Is the thing that I probably use more than anything like of all the computer software in the world.

296
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:25,037
Scott: Like I use Firefox and secure shell more than fucking anything else and I probably use secure shell more because I've been using it since before Fires Fox is around.

297
00:18:25,057 --> 00:18:32,670
Scott: I mean pretty much whenever I open a computer terminal The first thing I'm gonna type in is SSH something something and then get to work, right?

298
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,570
Scott: So what is the secure shell?

299
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:38,716
Scott: Basically back in the day you had telnet and you still have telnet.

300
00:18:38,756 --> 00:18:39,759
Scott: and what telnet does?

301
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:45,355
Scott: is it basically just you open a connection to a computer on a port and It sends bits back and forth?

302
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,021
Rym: now what does tell when I like to think about?

303
00:18:47,101 --> 00:18:48,707
Rym: I remember before I was being.

304
00:18:48,988 --> 00:19:06,761
Rym: before I was Very computer proficient, you know, I didn't know a lot about things, but I had my modem and a friend of mine had his modem Mm-hmm, and I remember being so excited about one day we got the modems to talk to each other and we both had a terminal open and I typed stuff on my screen and on his screen.

305
00:19:06,801 --> 00:19:08,727
Rym: He's like, I see everything you're typing.

306
00:19:09,128 --> 00:19:16,749
Rym: Oh my gosh Oh my gosh, and the fact that that the majority of my job goes funnels through what is effectively that?

307
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:17,150
Scott: yeah.

308
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:45,409
Scott: So if you want to see how telnet works, right how it was done in the olden days Type go to your command line even in Windows and type something like telnet space google.com space 80 and that will make a TCP connection to google.com on port 80 and then type like get in capital letters space forward slash or press enter and You'll see the HTML of google.com will come by because all you did was make a TCP connection to the Google web server and Tell it get forward slash which is HTTP protocol, right?

309
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:51,390
Scott: And then you'll see the what it get what you get back, which is the HTML of google.com.

310
00:19:51,611 --> 00:20:00,949
Rym: Well, I think people a lot of non-technical people don't seem to realize that Everything is other than X. pretty much everything in computing is pretty self consistent and simple.

311
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:04,010
Rym: actually It's just a lot of simple things that are repeated very quickly.

312
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,635
Scott: I mean a lot of layers.

313
00:20:05,776 --> 00:20:15,690
Rym: what I big onion something I often do when I'm working with systems is Telnet to a port that is not telnet because I can just send stuff to that port and it'll respond.

314
00:20:15,992 --> 00:20:27,121
Rym: Yeah, I mean like I have a fixed demon I can telnet to it And if I really want I can construct a message that it will accept as a fixed message and send it, you know When you go to your browser, you type google.com.

315
00:20:27,141 --> 00:20:28,125
Scott: What do you think it's doing?

316
00:20:28,165 --> 00:20:29,410
Scott: It's connecting to google.com.

317
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:33,006
Rym: I was doing like it's going get and then it gets HTML and then it renders.

318
00:20:33,026 --> 00:20:33,790
Scott: Yeah, it's what it's doing.

319
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,550
Scott: We just can't see that part cuz and it would be really annoying to use that way.

320
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:38,997
Scott: But that's the way the computers talk.

321
00:20:39,017 --> 00:20:40,545
Rym: That's the way real men use the internet.

322
00:20:40,665 --> 00:20:43,739
Scott: Oh, that was a big Thunder All right, so a way to break the fourth wall.

323
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,281
Rym: Oh shit.

324
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:46,470
Rym: We're real people in the real world and it's Thunder outside.

325
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:46,910
Scott: That's fine.

326
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,395
Scott: So secure shell right.

327
00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:52,990
Scott: see one of the most popular uses of telnet was to actually connect to another computer, right?

328
00:20:53,050 --> 00:21:04,676
Scott: For example, I have in the olden days you'd have like a mainframe right and the mainframe would run say a terminal program a terminal emulator a TTY on Port 90 so I don't know.

329
00:21:04,816 --> 00:21:25,924
Scott: pick a port number right and you would go to your terminal right your VT 100 terminal Which is not actually a computer just a terminal a keyboard and a monitor and you would telnet Which is it did it in hardware to port whatever on the mainframe and then that terminal that was running on the mainframe terminal software would show up on your physical hardware.

330
00:21:25,964 --> 00:21:31,004
Scott: VT 100 terminal and Unix and Linux still work that way on the lowest level.

331
00:21:31,025 --> 00:21:38,270
Scott: when you go to your Linux machine If you got an Ubuntu line around press like control alt f1 and you'll see TTY 0 staring at you.

332
00:21:38,692 --> 00:21:40,178
Scott: It's not running on a network port.

333
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,509
Scott: So you can't tell that into it, but it's running on.

334
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:43,738
Scott: you know This local display.

335
00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:44,121
Scott: you can.

336
00:21:44,141 --> 00:21:44,786
Scott: you can look at it.

337
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:51,965
Scott: So SSH is Basically a secure way of doing that secure shell.

338
00:21:52,006 --> 00:22:00,990
Scott: you're going to connect to Another computer right say from a terminal to a mainframe or nowadays usually a computer to a computer, right?

339
00:22:01,932 --> 00:22:06,150
Scott: And you're going to get a shell on that terminal and that other computer that you can use.

340
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,237
Scott: So most of the time you would use this.

341
00:22:08,318 --> 00:22:09,944
Scott: say I have a web server.

342
00:22:09,964 --> 00:22:11,630
Scott: I have a computer in my house.

343
00:22:12,112 --> 00:22:16,069
Scott: I have to connect to the web server and edit some files on it to can fit reconfigure it.

344
00:22:16,412 --> 00:22:18,428
Scott: Well, I will SSH to the web server.

345
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:29,150
Scott: now I am connected to it and the terminal from the web server shows up in a box on my screen and my computer and I Can control the web server even though I'm not sitting right next to it.

346
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:35,546
Scott: but it's as if I'm sitting right next to it and I basically use that more than freaking anything in the entire universe.

347
00:22:35,566 --> 00:22:41,190
Scott: because you know I've said my desk and whatever desk I'm sitting at be my laptop my actual desk my work desk.

348
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:45,543
Scott: Right the computers that I'm working on are not those computers.

349
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:48,875
Scott: the computer that I'm sitting at is just a desktop that I'm using Like the browser.

350
00:22:48,895 --> 00:22:50,747
Rym: do we really need to explain what SSH is?

351
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:55,488
Scott: Yeah, I want to make sure that people know because I hope the non tech people will learn to use SSH.

352
00:22:56,273 --> 00:22:56,939
Rym: I don't know more and more.

353
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,250
Rym: I see like the non tech people don't listen.

354
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:10,690
Rym: We got to figure out what to do with the Monday show because we always kind of reach this middle ground between you know This is what a keyboard is and the high-level stuff Alright, so so why is SSH cool and why do we replace telnet with it, right?

355
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:15,303
Scott: It's mostly an issue of security because telnet is just totally plain.

356
00:23:15,363 --> 00:23:20,641
Scott: whatever you send out people can just look at it on the internet It's it's not encrypted or secure in any way.

357
00:23:20,882 --> 00:23:32,498
Scott: if you log into some system over telnet Everyone could just see your username and password floating over the internet, whatever SSH solves this problem with hardcore encryption Totally hardcore and badass.

358
00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:43,261
Scott: that was trivially broken in SSH one with man-in-the-middle attacks Yes, so it SSH to which is the only one you should be using and you're if you don't know what you're using You're probably using SSH to that.

359
00:23:43,362 --> 00:23:44,970
Scott: almost nothing uses sh1 anymore.

360
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:50,369
Scott: And this is a wicked old piece of shit machine that no one updated like some HP x from a hundred years ago.

361
00:23:51,940 --> 00:24:01,929
Scott: so The way this works right is you just SSH to a machine and then by default it uses like password encryption But all the passwords are encrypted so no one can see them on the line.

362
00:24:02,572 --> 00:24:05,845
Scott: The thing is you don't want to use that because it's a pain in the ass every time you can.

363
00:24:05,905 --> 00:24:10,865
Scott: you're connecting the machines all The time all over the place and you're gonna keep typing in your passwords.

364
00:24:10,905 --> 00:24:12,853
Scott: and hopefully you have a good password So you're typing it in.

365
00:24:12,873 --> 00:24:14,499
Scott: typing it in typing in it sucks.

366
00:24:15,061 --> 00:24:21,068
Rym: Well, well now see I know where you're going with this But I have a much more secure and better solution that I use at work.

367
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,616
Scott: really What's a better solution?

368
00:24:22,757 --> 00:24:24,950
Rym: basically because of the nature of my work?

369
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,890
Rym: You know, we have to be able to have central account management trivially.

370
00:24:28,574 --> 00:24:29,278
Rym: So we use a pro.

371
00:24:29,298 --> 00:24:31,510
Rym: basically we have it integrated with the Active Directory.

372
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,216
Scott: Aha, where now that?

373
00:24:33,396 --> 00:24:38,989
Rym: so if I will but higher level, we're actually using the AD because LDAP, you know Active Directory is just okay.

374
00:24:39,451 --> 00:24:42,101
Rym: Basically, if you're using LDAP directly you're doing it wrong.

375
00:24:42,282 --> 00:24:44,209
Rym: No LDAP is such an obsolete.

376
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:59,802
Rym: just So what I do is I log into an X server that is in our corporate office hmm, and then from that X server I open I can open sessions to whatever other servers I want and I just Authenticate via Active Directory when that's it.

377
00:25:00,345 --> 00:25:01,210
Scott: Yeah, that's interesting.

378
00:25:01,471 --> 00:25:06,090
Rym: I got to use keys because that would mean that if any computer along the chain is compromised that everything's compromised.

379
00:25:06,151 --> 00:25:07,564
Rym: So no, no keys at all.

380
00:25:07,887 --> 00:25:16,038
Scott: Hmm But then have so you're like when you log to the X when you're connect to the X server, right that centralized one Right, then isn't doesn't?

381
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,030
Scott: isn't it using the keys to connect to the other servers along the line?

382
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:26,099
Rym: No It's just a convenience so that I can say, you know connect to my accession there and then if I have to go home Or leave my computer or something happens.

383
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:28,350
Rym: I can just connect to my accession again from somewhere.

384
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,177
Scott: How do the other computers know that it's?

385
00:25:30,358 --> 00:25:31,844
Scott: it's valid when you're connecting to them.

386
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:32,888
Scott: How do they know that?

387
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:33,330
Scott: It's cool.

388
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:33,932
Rym: What do you mean?

389
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:39,387
Scott: How do they know this is cool that I is there some sort of like Active Directory agent that keeps track Of it or what?

390
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:44,182
Rym: Basically you I mean not getting into the technical details because they're very boring.

391
00:25:44,222 --> 00:25:50,130
Rym: But yeah, basically whatever Active Directory users Permissions are there for a server or just there on that server.

392
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:56,839
Rym: So, you know this Active Directory account has this shell on the server and the shell on the server and the shell on the server And these accesses to these things.

393
00:25:57,061 --> 00:25:57,343
Rym: Uh-huh.

394
00:25:57,887 --> 00:25:58,370
Scott: That's interesting.

395
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:09,916
Scott: See I use the keys right and the way the keys work is you basically put your public key on the machine You want to connect to right and you have your private key on your local machine that you never share with anyone Of course as is private.

396
00:26:10,438 --> 00:26:12,387
Scott: and when you connect to the faraway machine, right?

397
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:18,770
Scott: You basically sign something and send it over the line and the other machine can tell if you signed it.

398
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:23,306
Scott: So it's basically proving who you are just because you have this key.

399
00:26:23,326 --> 00:26:26,544
Rym: It amazes me How many people just are incapable of setting this up?

400
00:26:26,604 --> 00:26:27,490
Rym: It's not that hard to do.

401
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,429
Scott: It's really easy to set up.

402
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:37,610
Scott: There's plenty of how-tos online and the best thing about it right is it's one of the rare instances where something can be a more Secure but be more convenient at the same time.

403
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:42,689
Rym: Well, well unless it there's always the problem of if your computer is compromised and you've got the keys there.

404
00:26:42,749 --> 00:26:44,859
Scott: Well That is true.

405
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:55,830
Scott: However your keys, you know You should keep them close to your chest and also you should have a passphrase on your keys Right so that even if someone gets your key, they don't they can't use it because they don't have the passphrase.

406
00:26:55,971 --> 00:26:59,090
Rym: Oh, so then I just have to type my password every time I log in.

407
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,830
Scott: That's not true because there is the SSH agent that you should be using.

408
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:06,169
Scott: See the way the SS ever happy if you use like Ubuntu or Mac.

409
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:12,030
Scott: now They have a key ring and the way this works basically is you let you log into your local machine.

410
00:27:12,572 --> 00:27:14,661
Scott: You activate your SSH private keys.

411
00:27:14,701 --> 00:27:20,810
Scott: you sort of you know by typing in your passphrase You're like key activate and then so it knows it's you and your key is now good.

412
00:27:21,392 --> 00:27:23,939
Scott: And then you can use the key without typing your password in.

413
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:29,369
Scott: but then once you log out or the agent dies or anything like That you're gonna have to reactivate the key.

414
00:27:29,531 --> 00:27:39,770
Scott: So basically, you know if someone steals your keys somehow They say they log into your computer remotely and copy the keys or they steal your computer And they turn it on and somehow log into your account, right?

415
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:44,064
Scott: They need to know the passphrase to unlock those keys to make them work.

416
00:27:44,084 --> 00:27:45,810
Scott: So just having the key is not enough.

417
00:27:45,911 --> 00:27:46,455
Scott: It's a something.

418
00:27:46,475 --> 00:27:59,386
Scott: you have something, you know Situation but you only have to type into something, you know Once each time you sit at the computer so that you know, it's not inconvenient Yeah, where you typing it every time you're logging in

419
00:27:59,406 --> 00:28:03,530
Rym: the problems with this So that one most people use Windows at work, even if they're doing Linux II stuff

420
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:04,594
Scott: I know it's like yet.

421
00:28:04,614 --> 00:28:09,572
Scott: He's the putty and the the pageant and the whole set up body is just so useless I don't.

422
00:28:09,592 --> 00:28:13,150
Scott: I actually really putty it just I've been rocking the putty lately.

423
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,643
Scott: I totally figured out how to get all that putty Jen pageant.

424
00:28:15,703 --> 00:28:16,426
Scott: I got it all to work.

425
00:28:16,467 --> 00:28:17,110
Scott: It's totally awesome.

426
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,818
Rym: I just use you know, we pay for X win 32.

427
00:28:18,818 --> 00:28:20,506
Scott: Oh if you're paying for it.

428
00:28:20,526 --> 00:28:22,989
Rym: Well, it's a different story It's just it's like night and day.

429
00:28:23,351 --> 00:28:30,749
Scott: yeah, well actually, you know, I use the the Ning X server on Windows with putty and it just frickin works great.

430
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:38,233
Scott: now that I Know because I know how to do it I could see easily though how someone who is not an expert at this sort of thing would have a very very difficult time Making it work.

431
00:28:38,595 --> 00:28:41,910
Rym: Well X 1 32 does a good job with their so-called quote like live things.

432
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:52,101
Rym: so I have this you know whole set of terminal sessions together and then I Can basically close it and reopen on different computers in real time and it take it just kind of takes care of a lot Of these basic things on the back end.

433
00:28:52,121 --> 00:28:53,370
Scott: Yeah, I can't do anything like that.

434
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:57,030
Scott: All I do is SSH to machines and I can also X forward from the machine.

435
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,355
Rym: I've got a terminal side to.

436
00:28:58,416 --> 00:28:59,219
Rym: that has been running.

437
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:01,850
Rym: basically I ran something as myself in the foreground.

438
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:05,230
Rym: So I have this output that I can see and this little GUI that pops up.

439
00:29:05,712 --> 00:29:08,990
Rym: It's been running continuously on that X server for like a year.

440
00:29:09,154 --> 00:29:16,761
Scott: Oh, wow See if I wanted to do something like that I would just use new screen and then when I SSH back in I would use screen X to Get back in the screen session.

441
00:29:16,802 --> 00:29:18,090
Scott: the screen would run for the whole year.

442
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:22,190
Scott: But yeah, the thing is I'm also using X a lot less lately like on all my servers.

443
00:29:22,331 --> 00:29:26,573
Scott: I'm just using server edition of Ubuntu with no X whatsoever Like.

444
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:30,110
Scott: the only X I actually use anymore is the X. that's on my Ubuntu laptop.

445
00:29:30,292 --> 00:29:32,031
Rym: I only use X for debugging stuff Like.

446
00:29:32,332 --> 00:29:35,347
Rym: I'm using this product to make like these fixed protocol gateways.

447
00:29:35,387 --> 00:29:35,910
Rym: We're like fixed.

448
00:29:35,991 --> 00:29:37,730
Rym: I just come in product and they go out.

449
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,153
Rym: Well, no it.

450
00:29:38,496 --> 00:29:46,730
Rym: when I say product, you know But I come we bought this product and it was given to me and they were like here This is a product that will do this thing that you need to do.

451
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,095
Rym: It should take you like 10 minutes to set up.

452
00:29:48,777 --> 00:29:49,741
Rym: It's not a product.

453
00:29:50,001 --> 00:29:51,728
Rym: It is a Java development framework.

454
00:29:51,808 --> 00:29:53,174
Rym: Fuck you Ah, it's.

455
00:29:53,214 --> 00:29:55,927
Rym: so yeah, I've been running all this Java code, but it's but it's in X.

456
00:29:56,168 --> 00:29:56,530
Scott: It needs X.

457
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,396
Rym: Well, no, no, it doesn't.

458
00:29:57,497 --> 00:29:57,718
Rym: it's.

459
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,470
Rym: basically it's just a Java.

460
00:29:59,553 --> 00:30:02,400
Rym: Okay The thing is for debugging purposes.

461
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:04,850
Rym: the Java has a nice GUI built in that I can pop up.

462
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:09,770
Rym: So when I run this fix router I can have it pop up a GUI that shows me all the connections on both sides.

463
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:10,433
Rym: Ah, that's nice.

464
00:30:10,493 --> 00:30:11,276
Rym: And the statuses of all of them.

465
00:30:11,316 --> 00:30:20,273
Rym: while I'm setting it up and then when it's done and I know it's working I turn off the GUI and then I you know, make it a Java like Linux service and then I'm done Hmm.

466
00:30:20,574 --> 00:30:20,775
Scott: Yes.

467
00:30:20,795 --> 00:30:23,766
Rym: Yeah, you know, I learned something because I forgot.

468
00:30:23,826 --> 00:30:30,550
Rym: basically, you know If you want to run something in the background Independent of your user to where you can even log off you you like the no hop and all that.

469
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:31,856
Rym: Yeah, like the best way to do it.

470
00:30:32,379 --> 00:30:33,846
Rym: I did the no hop and all that on this thing.

471
00:30:33,886 --> 00:30:37,234
Rym: Just not thinking and Suddenly var was full.

472
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:38,559
Rym: Yeah lot.

473
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:41,750
Rym: No var filled up like 80 gigs were full.

474
00:30:42,255 --> 00:30:43,509
Scott: Standard out was queuing up.

475
00:30:43,631 --> 00:30:52,390
Rym: well the standard out was queuing up and there was a loop with the standard in because the program but you I have to specify no Hop in the thing and specify no up on the command line.

476
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:57,349
Scott: I just put an ampersand at the end and then do use FG and PS to get them back.

477
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,337
Scott: Well, I do the foreground F G BG.

478
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:05,211
Rym: some of this Java stuff though doesn't handle that so gracefully Is it?

479
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:14,209
Scott: you should theoretically be Developing it locally because it's multi flat It's cross-platform and then you can just deploy it to the other server.

480
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:15,436
Rym: now But the thing is setting up.

481
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:21,399
Rym: the Java environment is 90% of the battle in Java Environments plus it's also an eclipse deal.

482
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,610
Rym: Nah, it's also the environment of the network.

483
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,590
Rym: Remember, this is a network thing, basically.

484
00:31:27,173 --> 00:31:30,870
Rym: So the environment of the network and the firewalls at all different chains.

485
00:31:31,212 --> 00:31:34,551
Rym: It makes sense to develop it on the server where it's gonna be running one One.

486
00:31:34,591 --> 00:31:35,655
Scott: other thing to talk about.

487
00:31:35,775 --> 00:31:40,010
Scott: SSH tried to bring it back here right is people don't know about the secret feature of SSH?

488
00:31:40,071 --> 00:31:49,514
Scott: Well, there's many secret features But the number one port forwarding one is the SSH secure tunnel port forwarding and tunnels are like They'll solve.

489
00:31:49,594 --> 00:31:50,818
Rym: Oh anytime you have a problem.

490
00:31:50,838 --> 00:31:53,004
Rym: It is probably solved by that.

491
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:57,269
Scott: Yeah, so let's say for example I don't know.

492
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:06,730
Scott: So I've got a computer and it's got a web server on port 80 where it belongs right and I want to connect to that port 80 Securely right from far away.

493
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:30,570
Scott: What I can do is I can SSH to that machine and I can make an SSH tunnel Right, which would connect port 80 to say port 80 80. then I can SSH to port 80 80 and Connect that to the port on my local machine and then I can open up my web browser and be like localhost Something something and it's actually making this big tunnel across the internet all the way to some other machine.

494
00:32:30,913 --> 00:32:32,909
Scott: That whole tunnel is totally secure.

495
00:32:33,432 --> 00:32:56,204
Scott: But what happens is there's a port on my local machine that's now securely attached to some port on some other machine across who knows where and I can just securely connect to anything Over SSH and it's it's super super freakin useful in ways that like you won't even realize Like, you know, I try to think of like a really good example.

496
00:32:56,244 --> 00:33:05,050
Scott: Here's a good example, right we had We couldn't get into our home network when we were away on vacation, right and we needed to reconfigure the router.

497
00:33:05,411 --> 00:33:12,307
Scott: But the only way to connect to the router was the routers web server and you can't connect to the routers web server Remotely, you have to be in the house to do it.

498
00:33:12,871 --> 00:33:15,889
Scott: But I had hamachi running on one of the machines in the house.

499
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:34,690
Scott: so SSH to the machine in the house over hamachi, right and then I Made an SSH tunnel to the routers web server and then on my laptop out while I was on vacation I was able to bring up the routers configuration interface over this is double SSH tunnel and reconfigure the router.

500
00:33:34,974 --> 00:33:36,008
Scott: Well, I wasn't even at home.

501
00:33:36,751 --> 00:33:38,837
Scott: That's the kind of awesomeness and it was totally secure.

502
00:33:38,937 --> 00:33:44,270
Scott: every part of that transaction was totally encrypted and totally safe and nobody's broken it.

503
00:33:44,290 --> 00:34:04,370
Scott: I mean SSH is it a lot of problems, but it's one of those things that it's so ludicrously important that Like pretty much they're constantly ahead of the hackers Like they're just always they're finding things in SSH that are like might be security problems and fixing them Even though no one's taking advantage of them yet or even thought about taking advantage of them.

504
00:34:04,533 --> 00:34:05,067
Scott: It's you know.

505
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:18,869
Scott: So the day when SSH is broken is a very bad day and you'll see that that'll be a lot worse than like some you Know ie windows vulnerability, you know all real things are gonna start breaking if SSH has a vulnerability in it.

506
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:24,020
Scott: So, yeah SSH is a tool that people should learn how to use.

507
00:34:24,501 --> 00:34:25,243
Scott: it's totally this.

508
00:34:25,342 --> 00:34:33,563
Scott: open SSH is the most popular implementation of it But there are many non free implementations But as far as I've been experiencing they pretty much all work together.

509
00:34:33,643 --> 00:34:35,370
Scott: just just fine that you know.

510
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,213
Scott: They have no problem.

511
00:34:36,635 --> 00:34:39,043
Scott: putty is the client you want to use if you're on Windows.

512
00:34:39,065 --> 00:34:45,389
Scott: if you're on anything else You just have actual open SSH, but on Windows you need to use weird stuff because Windows side

513
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:55,657
Rym: It still just really amazes me that to this day like Windows almost is in this ghetto when it like it Windows works fine For just about everything you want to do Except interacting with real development environments.

514
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:59,992
Rym: You basically just can't SSH or SCP or do anything by default I think.

515
00:35:00,012 --> 00:35:00,856
Scott: well not by default.

516
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:01,418
Scott: No, not at all.

517
00:35:01,438 --> 00:35:09,690
Scott: But putty I think is a great client, but in terms of servers I mean there are Windows SSH servers, but they're all shit except for the ones that cost a ton of money, right?

518
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:10,031
Scott: There's like.

519
00:35:10,051 --> 00:35:18,779
Scott: there are ones that actually are very expensive and I've gotten like demos of them and they're great once they work but They're you know, all the free ones on Windows suck.

520
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,610
Scott: theoretically you can use open SSH on Windows the server.

521
00:35:22,172 --> 00:35:23,638
Scott: I've never gotten that to work ever.

522
00:35:23,658 --> 00:35:26,510
Scott: and even if it does work, I can't imagine it's very good.

523
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:35,629
Scott: But every other machine every Unix Mac Linux just open SSH just works amazingly and perfectly every time Especially if you have a newer version of it.

524
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,014
Scott: It's just great fantastic.

525
00:35:37,515 --> 00:35:42,850
Scott: and and Ubuntu and OS X both have GUI key management utilities that just work.

526
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,820
Scott: No problem, they handle the agent.

527
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,930
Scott: they handle everything for you in Windows.

528
00:35:47,091 --> 00:35:54,710
Scott: If you want to do that stuff, you need to use putty Jen and pageant, you know P You know the putty agent and I've gotten those things to work.

529
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:57,558
Scott: It's not difficult, but it does require some doing.

530
00:35:57,638 --> 00:36:01,610
Scott: it's not just you know, push a button like it is in Mac and Linux.

531
00:36:01,851 --> 00:36:11,227
Rym: One thing I've really it seems strange to me that even a lot of technical people I know don't know any like they really don't know any of the advanced stuff around SSH and terminals.

532
00:36:11,789 --> 00:36:16,410
Scott: Yeah I mean, it's usually because most especially IT people are mostly Windows people, you know.

533
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,566
Scott: And they Windows people just don't use SSH.

534
00:36:19,211 --> 00:36:23,670
Scott: They always use like even remote desktop or go to my PC or any of those sorts of things.

535
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,455
Rym: Oh my god any.

536
00:36:24,837 --> 00:36:31,669
Rym: pretty much whenever I work, you know, I interview people I one of the things I always ask them is like yeah go to my PC and all that stuff because I know they don't Know what they're doing.

537
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:36,933
Scott: Pretty readily by asking them those sorts of go to my PC is actually a good product But it is.

538
00:36:36,973 --> 00:36:39,040
Scott: maybe use it as an IT tool.

539
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:39,843
Scott: That's a problem.

540
00:36:39,883 --> 00:36:41,970
Scott: Yeah, you know, that should not be no same thing.

541
00:36:42,231 --> 00:36:42,833
Scott: VNC.

542
00:36:42,853 --> 00:36:43,757
Scott: like you go to those companies.

543
00:36:43,777 --> 00:36:45,886
Scott: It was like a VNC server running at every desktop.

544
00:36:46,328 --> 00:36:59,610
Rym: bad And the way they teach people and I remember that the first year of our IT is a freshman It was every class basically forced you to use all of these Unix tools and they weren't taught to you.

545
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:05,070
Rym: It was just assumed that you either knew them or you'd figure them out And you could tell the people who didn't figure them out because they didn't graduate.

546
00:37:05,472 --> 00:37:08,246
Scott: Here's another example of why SSH is awesome, right?

547
00:37:08,406 --> 00:37:09,070
Scott: I was at RIT.

548
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,710
Scott: I was a computer science student, right?

549
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:20,403
Scott: even if you could work on your projects at home you needed to go to the computer science lab and you had to submit it On their computer science computers and had to work on those computers, right?

550
00:37:20,684 --> 00:37:22,410
Scott: You couldn't submit it from your computer.

551
00:37:23,271 --> 00:37:30,409
Scott: The thing is you could SSH to the computer science lab and use one of those computers Even though you weren't sitting in front of it, which is very nice.

552
00:37:30,812 --> 00:37:34,250
Scott: You can just do all your computer science work from your dorm or your apartment.

553
00:37:35,193 --> 00:37:36,228
Scott: Smart people did that.

554
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:43,682
Scott: Stupid people went into the CS labs and had to go all the way across campus or commute or whatever else the hell they did To get over there, right?

555
00:37:44,127 --> 00:37:49,350
Scott: So That's that's the kind of power that something like SSH has and that's what I started using.

556
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:55,930
Scott: It was when I decided I was gonna save myself a trip across campus because SSH is just that powerful.

557
00:37:56,192 --> 00:37:58,549
Scott: It's as powerful as a two-mile walk.

558
00:38:00,371 --> 00:38:02,097
Rym: Alright, I gotta go to work soon.

559
00:38:02,117 --> 00:38:03,461
Scott: Oh man, night work.

560
00:38:03,762 --> 00:38:05,930
Rym: And there's a crazy thunderstorm, so I think we'll just leave it at that.

561
00:38:06,092 --> 00:38:06,888
Scott: Yeah, that's done.

562
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:15,598
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

563
00:38:15,678 --> 00:38:18,184
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

564
