1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,224
Rym: It's Monday, October 8th, 2012.

2
00:00:10,224 --> 00:00:11,808
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:13,372
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,512 --> 00:00:15,397
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,457 --> 00:00:18,201
Rym: Tonight's sabotage hardware.

6
00:00:20,403 --> 00:00:21,485
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,648 --> 00:00:26,749
Rym: So we're catching up on shows.

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,332
Rym: I mean it's been a while since we've had like a full couple of weeks of GeekNights in a row with all our travel.

9
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:34,402
Scott: We're coming up on the seventh anniversary of GeekNights.

10
00:00:34,422 --> 00:00:38,791
Rym: Oh my 31st, 2005.

11
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:39,874
Rym: It's what 2012 now?

12
00:00:39,894 --> 00:00:39,994
Rym: Jesus.

13
00:00:40,636 --> 00:00:42,521
Scott: I can't believe we've been...

14
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:46,534
Rym: I can't believe how many years.

15
00:00:46,554 --> 00:00:47,601
Scott: Let's just stop dealing with this shit.

16
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:49,252
Scott: then we could think about all the free time we'll have.

17
00:00:49,312 --> 00:00:54,155
Rym: I remember those days before we started GeekNights but after we graduated college.

18
00:00:54,236 --> 00:01:04,843
Rym: I would come home from work and you'd come home from work in our giant geek house and we would watch like two movies on Netflix and then play Counter-Strike for like two hours and then cook dinner.

19
00:01:05,063 --> 00:01:05,284
Scott: Yeah.

20
00:01:06,248 --> 00:01:09,120
Rym: We'd go to a convention and just fuck around for three days.

21
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,144
Rym: Yep.

22
00:01:10,686 --> 00:01:12,714
Rym: Actually we did panels even back then so we didn't really.

23
00:01:13,176 --> 00:01:13,598
Rym: That's true.

24
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,028
Rym: Even then we were not completely free.

25
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:42,570
Rym: So some time ago I was in India for you know about two weeks and I had my laptop with me and one thing I did every night was you know play FTL and use my laptop for laptopy things and on one night I think was like Wednesday night using my laptop and suddenly while I'm typing in Chrome, Chrome crashes and I'm like okay and I try to start it again and it like starts but it's slow as shit.

26
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:48,472
Rym: and like if I type in Chrome it's super slow but everything else I can type into just fine.

27
00:01:48,492 --> 00:01:52,186
Rym: and then my internet stops working and I'm like what?

28
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:55,258
Rym: Oh it's Windows the fuck ever so I just reboot.

29
00:01:56,202 --> 00:02:01,339
Rym: When I reboot my computer starts again and if I start Chrome the same thing happens.

30
00:02:02,403 --> 00:02:03,466
Rym: So I'm like alright.

31
00:02:03,687 --> 00:02:11,642
Rym: whatevs time to investigate this a little bit and I've been working actually on a project a gaming thing I've been working on so I just.

32
00:02:11,682 --> 00:02:14,014
Scott: Sounds like some important file was perhaps corrupted.

33
00:02:14,054 --> 00:02:14,295
Rym: Yeah.

34
00:02:15,521 --> 00:02:15,983
Rym: So I had this.

35
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:20,186
Rym: so I figured alright I'll deal with this later and I open up this image to start editing it again.

36
00:02:20,246 --> 00:02:32,100
Rym: but first I double click on it and just to look at it and you know in Windows that just opens it in the windows like image viewer thingy and I get an error that says like memory couldn't be referenced when I double click on that.

37
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,110
Scott: Was your RAM broken?

38
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,655
Rym: So I'm like what?

39
00:02:35,675 --> 00:02:37,403
Rym: So I open it in Photoshop and it's fine.

40
00:02:38,267 --> 00:02:40,576
Scott: Yep definitely the file is broken somewhere.

41
00:02:41,118 --> 00:02:44,189
Rym: So then I realized something weird is going on.

42
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:48,251
Rym: so I just took my internet and you know in Windows it's not like Linux like if down if up.

43
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,057
Rym: it's trivial to troubleshoot network issues.

44
00:02:50,438 --> 00:02:51,582
Rym: so I right-click on the.

45
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,257
Scott: That works for me fifty percent of the time.

46
00:02:56,297 --> 00:02:58,846
Rym: It actually works a lot better than it used to.

47
00:02:59,308 --> 00:03:01,519
Rym: and I get a. I get a weird ass error.

48
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:04,613
Rym: I got a screenshot of it but Jesus Christ it was this crazy error.

49
00:03:05,415 --> 00:03:07,862
Rym: So I'm like huh.

50
00:03:08,604 --> 00:03:10,710
Rym: So it appears you know I do some digging.

51
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,069
Rym: it looks like a bunch of Windows system files got corrupted or something.

52
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:14,611
Scott: Makes sense.

53
00:03:15,293 --> 00:03:17,480
Rym: So I reboot to do a Fisk.

54
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,282
Rym: well a check disk.

55
00:03:18,423 --> 00:03:26,065
Rym: it's not Fisk but anyway and sure enough Fisk finds like 20 gigabytes of orphan files.

56
00:03:26,426 --> 00:03:26,928
Scott: Alright.

57
00:03:27,048 --> 00:03:28,615
Rym: And it's mostly Windows system files.

58
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:32,715
Scott: See that sounds to me like it wasn't a large portion of the hard drive that was fucked up.

59
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:36,032
Scott: it was a very small portion of the NTFS you know data.

60
00:03:36,152 --> 00:03:36,714
Scott: Exactly.

61
00:03:36,735 --> 00:03:37,638
Scott: That was fucked up.

62
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,901
Rym: Now it's a pretty new laptop with a really good SSD and I you know it's not like I do anything.

63
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:43,464
Scott: Yeah it's weird.

64
00:03:43,504 --> 00:03:44,670
Scott: I had an SSD for that to happen.

65
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:45,391
Scott: Yeah.

66
00:03:45,411 --> 00:03:48,487
Scott: It could just be one spot got the too many writes or who knows.

67
00:03:48,507 --> 00:03:50,876
Rym: Now the thing is an orphan file you can't just recover from.

68
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:51,419
Rym: it's not like.

69
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:52,904
Rym: it puts it back it can.

70
00:03:53,105 --> 00:03:53,366
Scott: No.

71
00:03:53,627 --> 00:03:55,839
Rym: So I figure alright I'll just re-image it.

72
00:03:55,899 --> 00:03:58,334
Rym: I'll read you know you run the like Windows repair and it'll be fine.

73
00:03:58,354 --> 00:04:06,755
Rym: So I'm watching this file the scroll by while it finds all the orphans and then I see all this Adobe shit go by and all the Steam shit go by and I'm like oh it's fucked now.

74
00:04:06,775 --> 00:04:08,742
Scott: Fuck.

75
00:04:09,264 --> 00:04:10,367
Scott: It's reinstalled at Windows.

76
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,196
Rym: So it all goes by and then it's done.

77
00:04:12,236 --> 00:04:14,468
Rym: so I get back into Windows and poke around.

78
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:16,539
Rym: of course nothing's fixed because they couldn't actually fix it.

79
00:04:17,142 --> 00:04:18,850
Rym: So I run the hardware.

80
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,959
Rym: Lenovo like scan my hardware for bullshit.

81
00:04:22,461 --> 00:04:23,985
Rym: No problems with the RAM of course.

82
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:27,016
Rym: No problems with the hard drive at all either.

83
00:04:27,056 --> 00:04:29,065
Rym: I even ran these deep diagnostics.

84
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:31,857
Scott: Some software probably just messed up the data on the drive.

85
00:04:32,058 --> 00:04:32,942
Rym: Yeah but I run like.

86
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:35,091
Scott: Cause it could have been a cosmic ray.

87
00:04:35,131 --> 00:04:35,492
Rym: I know.

88
00:04:35,753 --> 00:04:36,836
Rym: Thing is cosmic.

89
00:04:37,418 --> 00:04:37,839
Rym: You know.

90
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:43,538
Rym: So in the old days cosmic rays were often a cause of single bit errors in RAM.

91
00:04:43,558 --> 00:04:44,361
Scott: Right well the thing is.

92
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:49,563
Scott: But they often don't affect hard drives because it's especially not solid state.

93
00:04:49,603 --> 00:04:51,712
Rym: Well no solid state drive is just flash.

94
00:04:51,772 --> 00:04:54,887
Rym: It's actually easier to affect with a cosmic ray than an old spinning disk.

95
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:04,867
Scott: I thought it was that you would get the one bit errors in RAM because RAM is like a grid of tiny capacitors and the cosmic ray would charge up an empty capacitor.

96
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,494
Scott: You can't empty a charged one right.

97
00:05:06,835 --> 00:05:12,136
Scott: Whereas flash memory is not really capacitors so that a cosmic ray isn't really going to fuck it up.

98
00:05:12,336 --> 00:05:13,220
Rym: No cause it could flip.

99
00:05:13,482 --> 00:05:17,035
Scott: That is based on my really really shitty electronics knowledge.

100
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:18,039
Scott: It could flip the NAND gate.

101
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,741
Rym: Anyway.

102
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:19,182
Rym: So I kept.

103
00:05:19,242 --> 00:05:24,579
Rym: So basically I rebooted after doing all this again and then BSOD.

104
00:05:24,619 --> 00:05:24,740
Rym: BSOD.

105
00:05:25,462 --> 00:05:26,104
Rym: BSOD.

106
00:05:26,184 --> 00:05:26,786
Rym: BSOD.

107
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:27,067
Rym: Great.

108
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,962
Rym: So I did a system restore and that actually.

109
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:34,255
Scott: Was that using that sort of extra partition that has the Lenovo shit on it?

110
00:05:34,316 --> 00:05:35,841
Rym: No that partitions already gone.

111
00:05:36,223 --> 00:05:36,986
Scott: Oh you removed it?

112
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:37,387
Rym: Yeah.

113
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:38,672
Scott: I didn't remove mine.

114
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:39,717
Rym: But I removed mine.

115
00:05:39,758 --> 00:05:42,048
Scott: Because my computer did not come with a disk.

116
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:45,527
Scott: so I'm like I got to keep that extra partition because that's basically my Windows CD.

117
00:05:45,588 --> 00:05:48,304
Rym: Yeah so when you double click on that partition Lenovo you know what it says?

118
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:50,455
Scott: You push the blue button on startup and then you do it.

119
00:05:50,776 --> 00:05:51,719
Rym: No you know what it says?

120
00:05:52,362 --> 00:05:55,513
Rym: It says hey you want to recover all this space?

121
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,085
Rym: So if you hit yes you know what it says?

122
00:05:59,406 --> 00:06:00,290
Rym: Give me a flash drive.

123
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,499
Scott: Let's see I got my Lenovo right now.

124
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:03,845
Rym: Yeah so it'll ask for a flash drive.

125
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:05,492
Scott: Hold on my computer OK.

126
00:06:05,813 --> 00:06:06,737
Scott: I guess you never did this.

127
00:06:06,838 --> 00:06:07,561
Scott: I double clicked on.

128
00:06:08,022 --> 00:06:09,769
Scott: Oh create recovery media.

129
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:09,890
Scott: Yeah.

130
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,554
Scott: Recover drive space.

131
00:06:11,895 --> 00:06:12,718
Rym: Yeah.

132
00:06:12,898 --> 00:06:14,844
Rym: Welcome to when SSDs first appeared.

133
00:06:14,865 --> 00:06:16,831
Scott: See look I still have mine.

134
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:18,217
Scott: look.

135
00:06:18,518 --> 00:06:20,084
Scott: It totally did exactly what you said.

136
00:06:20,145 --> 00:06:20,627
Scott: Look right here.

137
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:23,500
Scott: look there's two buttons create recovery media and recover drive space.

138
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,128
Scott: So I'm just gonna leave it there.

139
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:28,064
Scott: so that way if I want I can turn on the computer and push the blue button.

140
00:06:28,084 --> 00:06:28,989
Rym: Yeah you know what.

141
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:31,401
Rym: I got rid of it because I only have 120 gigabyte SSD.

142
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:34,635
Scott: I also have 120 gigabyte SSD but you know what how much space I have free?

143
00:06:34,655 --> 00:06:39,452
Scott: I have 35 gigs free and there's only 10 gigs on that space.

144
00:06:39,492 --> 00:06:40,857
Scott: so it's not really gonna help me that much.

145
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:47,822
Rym: Yeah I had 45 gigs free but I do HD video editing on my laptop like at a con and.

146
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,135
Scott: If I was gonna do that I would use my external 500 gig drive.

147
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:55,674
Rym: Oh I do that too but I still need a lot of scratch space locally for all those renders and shit.

148
00:06:55,855 --> 00:06:57,422
Scott: Well I'm not gonna edit more than.

149
00:06:57,522 --> 00:07:06,914
Rym: That panel a 20 minute panel needs 40 gigabytes of scratch space to render to GoPro camera angles to be able to play them simultaneously.

150
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:08,963
Scott: Not gonna do that on my laptop.

151
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,273
Rym: Anyway so I gotta reimage my fucking laptop.

152
00:07:11,394 --> 00:07:12,258
Rym: fuck that bullshit.

153
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:12,600
Rym: but whatever.

154
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,786
Scott: Well you have the USB stick right?

155
00:07:13,807 --> 00:07:14,249
Rym: Yes I do.

156
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,973
Rym: it's sitting right there.

157
00:07:14,993 --> 00:07:15,577
Scott: Oh well that's good.

158
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:17,427
Rym: My other USB stick is being ready.

159
00:07:17,488 --> 00:07:19,255
Scott: How big did that USB stick need to be?

160
00:07:19,777 --> 00:07:21,344
Rym: Like six gigs it used up.

161
00:07:21,725 --> 00:07:21,926
Scott: Okay.

162
00:07:21,986 --> 00:07:22,990
Rym: It like compresses and stuff.

163
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,757
Scott: Let's see let's go a new egg and check it out.

164
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:25,861
Rym: Dude I got.

165
00:07:26,002 --> 00:07:30,758
Rym: I bought two 16 gig like super fast flashes for like nothing.

166
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,624
Scott: Flash memory and readers.

167
00:07:32,644 --> 00:07:33,206
Scott: Alright.

168
00:07:33,326 --> 00:07:33,767
Scott: You looking?

169
00:07:34,128 --> 00:07:35,673
Scott: Yeah USB flash drives.

170
00:07:36,736 --> 00:07:38,541
Scott: Oh my god that's out of stock.

171
00:07:38,581 --> 00:07:39,444
Scott: they had a deal.

172
00:07:39,464 --> 00:07:43,617
Scott: I think it was 32 gigs for 25 bucks USB stick.

173
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:44,841
Rym: Thing is my 16.

174
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:49,739
Rym: I realized flash drives are too little too late for me because every time one comes out that's ridiculous.

175
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:52,611
Rym: it's already not big enough for me to even care.

176
00:07:52,631 --> 00:07:56,346
Scott: Alright I'm checking for 8 gig USB 3.0 cause you wanna be fast right?

177
00:07:56,486 --> 00:07:56,567
Scott: Yeah.

178
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:56,707
Scott: 12 bucks.

179
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:58,413
Scott: Yeah.

180
00:07:58,493 --> 00:07:58,633
Scott: Okay.

181
00:07:58,954 --> 00:07:59,496
Scott: Yeah.

182
00:07:59,516 --> 00:08:00,298
Scott: So check this out.

183
00:08:01,201 --> 00:08:04,390
Scott: Yesterday I went to the Giants were playing Cleveland.

184
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,102
Scott: so that's basically well it's the Giants.

185
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:12,710
Scott: you can never trust them but Cleveland's the worst team in football and the Giants did win even though they started the game 14 nothing whatever.

186
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,779
Scott: We didn't need to watch the giant game.

187
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:16,429
Rym: Yeah my fantasy teams didn't do so.

188
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:16,529
Scott: well.

189
00:08:16,549 --> 00:08:18,135
Scott: It was the one giant game you don't need to watch.

190
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:20,564
Scott: so we had tickets to go.

191
00:08:20,664 --> 00:08:21,026
Scott: see.

192
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:24,275
Scott: you know New England and Denver in Massachusetts right?

193
00:08:24,475 --> 00:08:25,497
Rym: Masa Husatz.

194
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:32,115
Scott: So I go with my dad and my dad's secretary's husband who's totally cool guy.

195
00:08:32,135 --> 00:08:32,999
Scott: he's awesome right?

196
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:33,421
Scott: Alright.

197
00:08:33,883 --> 00:08:36,375
Scott: So we basically he lives up you know in Hartford.

198
00:08:36,395 --> 00:08:41,419
Scott: so we basically drove up there and then he drove us to Massachusetts and then right there's a little sharing of the driving.

199
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,163
Rym: Masa Husatz?

200
00:08:42,424 --> 00:08:43,830
Scott: Yeah it's Foxborough.

201
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:49,169
Scott: So you know the game wasn't that exciting but you know we saw a big name whatever.

202
00:08:49,189 --> 00:08:49,591
Scott: this isn't.

203
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:50,716
Scott: story is not about the game.

204
00:08:50,756 --> 00:08:53,670
Scott: the story is about the town this dude lives in right?

205
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:57,828
Scott: So we're chatting him up and there was a. it was a little fair in his town you know.

206
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,261
Scott: so he's talking about his daughter's going to the fair.

207
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:02,472
Scott: he was at the fair the day before right.

208
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:07,993
Scott: apparently there was something going on at this fair and it was a really a hick kind of affair.

209
00:09:08,274 --> 00:09:09,478
Scott: they had tractor pulls.

210
00:09:09,558 --> 00:09:10,320
Rym: Demolition Derby?

211
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:11,284
Scott: They had.

212
00:09:11,304 --> 00:09:13,210
Scott: you know pumpkin sized contest.

213
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:13,972
Rym: Demolition Derby?

214
00:09:14,113 --> 00:09:14,595
Rym: No.

215
00:09:14,775 --> 00:09:17,204
Rym: I'm a huge fan of demolition derbies.

216
00:09:17,244 --> 00:09:18,950
Scott: They did not have it but they had.

217
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,155
Rym: I've been to dozens of them.

218
00:09:20,176 --> 00:09:20,999
Scott: This is not the story.

219
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:21,522
Scott: Okay.

220
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:25,280
Scott: The story is about they had rodeo type stuff including bull riding right?

221
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:31,773
Scott: So you know there's nothing wrong with bull riding you know I guess if you care about animals maybe but you know bull riding is done by professionals right?

222
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:37,030
Scott: Apparently they had at this fair something called the Ring of Fire.

223
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,596
Scott: Let me show you the picture of the Ring of Fire.

224
00:09:39,616 --> 00:09:44,575
Scott: You can see here it's basically inside of a rodeo fence.

225
00:09:44,896 --> 00:09:52,178
Scott: they have a bunch of dirt like a rodeo and a chalk circle that's maybe 10 feet in diameter maybe 20 feet.

226
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:57,277
Scott: you know it's not such a big circle of chalk and you basically you're ready.

227
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:58,924
Scott: this is the stupidest thing in the universe.

228
00:09:59,587 --> 00:10:01,213
Scott: Ready to see how stupid this is?

229
00:10:01,353 --> 00:10:05,808
Scott: If you want to go in the Ring of Fire you pay money right?

230
00:10:05,828 --> 00:10:06,370
Scott: They don't pay you.

231
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,076
Scott: you pay them right?

232
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:14,737
Scott: So you give this guy 20 bucks and then you are allowed into the Ring of Fire.

233
00:10:14,757 --> 00:10:22,200
Scott: Then it's real simple if you're the last person remaining in the Ring of Fire you get all the 20's from all the people.

234
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:23,444
Rym: Oh that's great.

235
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:23,966
Rym: I'll do that.

236
00:10:24,327 --> 00:10:26,778
Scott: Right so but here's the part that you have not heard yet.

237
00:10:27,963 --> 00:10:28,666
Scott: How do you you know?

238
00:10:28,686 --> 00:10:33,331
Scott: you've got to be thinking well if you're the last one remaining right well what's pushing you out of the Ring of Fire?

239
00:10:33,351 --> 00:10:33,912
Scott: the other people?

240
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:34,975
Rym: A bull?

241
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,660
Rym: A car?

242
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:37,964
Scott: It is indeed a bull.

243
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:48,878
Scott: They just let a bull loose on you and the last person who's still in the Ring of Fire after they let the bull loose in the cage gets all the 20's.

244
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:52,669
Scott: Now you got to be thinking I might do that but not.

245
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:55,641
Scott: there were only 10 people in the Ring of Fire 200 bucks.

246
00:10:55,701 --> 00:10:57,528
Scott: are you kidding me?

247
00:10:57,548 --> 00:11:01,723
Scott: You would have to pay me 200 bucks to even consider going in the Ring of Fire.

248
00:11:01,783 --> 00:11:07,863
Scott: I think 2,000 might get me to stand in a very large Ring of Fire with hundreds of people in it.

249
00:11:08,665 --> 00:11:14,270
Rym: I have a feeling if the Ring of Fire is hundreds of people in it the bull is the least of your problems.

250
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:17,764
Scott: Yeah no so the Ring of Fire only likes to want 10 people in it.

251
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:23,306
Scott: so if you go to I'm linking to this article but at the bottom of the article is a link that says 2C video.

252
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:27,502
Scott: click here and that will take you to the local news which has the footage.

253
00:11:28,586 --> 00:11:30,435
Rym: Oh my god here's a video of a Ring of Fire.

254
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:32,426
Scott: That's not the Ring of Fire that's a different one.

255
00:11:32,506 --> 00:11:33,953
Rym: It's the same thing I think.

256
00:11:34,255 --> 00:11:38,856
Scott: That is the same thing but that is not the Ring of Fire from the Berlin Fair in Connecticut.

257
00:11:38,876 --> 00:11:39,940
Rym: Alright they're letting the bull in.

258
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,633
Rym: Oh the bull just fucked that guy up.

259
00:11:44,175 --> 00:11:46,981
Rym: Oh he pushed him back into the ring.

260
00:11:47,121 --> 00:11:48,485
Scott: That doesn't count though he's out.

261
00:11:48,485 --> 00:11:51,191
Rym: 3 guys left.

262
00:11:51,873 --> 00:11:53,639
Scott: This is a more typical Ring of Fire.

263
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,123
Rym: There's no actual fire.

264
00:11:55,324 --> 00:12:00,200
Scott: It looks like these are professional rodeo guys in this Ring of Fire.

265
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,384
Rym: Alright that guy's done.

266
00:12:01,404 --> 00:12:03,572
Rym: I guess the bull's gone.

267
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:08,426
Scott: They're trying to get his attention to get the other guys out or anyway.

268
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:11,437
Rym: There's only like 30 seconds left on this video.

269
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,108
Scott: I wonder if the bull's coming back or not.

270
00:12:14,289 --> 00:12:15,211
Rym: Bull's never coming back.

271
00:12:15,351 --> 00:12:16,212
Rym: Bull didn't give a fuck.

272
00:12:17,134 --> 00:12:18,976
Scott: Oh here he comes.

273
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:21,840
Scott: Nice move.

274
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:30,134
Rym: That guy doesn't have a good strategy.

275
00:12:30,495 --> 00:12:31,237
Scott: That guy wins.

276
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:32,501
Scott: Now he's running out.

277
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:33,604
Scott: after he wins he's leaving.

278
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:43,121
Scott: Okay so in this particular Ring of Fire in Connecticut a lot of the people who went in this Ring of Fire were not professional rodeo type people.

279
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:46,817
Scott: They were just like the guy who was running the fair did it and all right.

280
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:48,866
Scott: You watch this video the bull comes in.

281
00:12:48,926 --> 00:12:49,670
Scott: it wasn't like that.

282
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,179
Scott: It pretty much knocked people over like bowling pins.

283
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:56,196
Scott: And then when he came back for the second pass that was the end.

284
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:59,089
Scott: Everyone was trying to boom and half the people were out.

285
00:12:59,109 --> 00:13:00,534
Scott: and then boom everyone else was out.

286
00:13:01,095 --> 00:13:10,327
Scott: The person who was last in technically got stomped by the bull on its way out and she was all fucked up and went to the hospital.

287
00:13:10,347 --> 00:13:11,110
Scott: and this was news.

288
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,258
Rym: So so so so I have something to say about this.

289
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:16,131
Scott: Why the fuck is this a thing that you're doing at all?

290
00:13:16,151 --> 00:13:17,819
Rym: That's what I was about to ask because.

291
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,045
Scott: Why is this allowed?

292
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:19,648
Scott: So Scott.

293
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:20,872
Scott: They stopped doing it.

294
00:13:20,892 --> 00:13:26,190
Rym: We're worried at conventions about getting sued for underage drinking.

295
00:13:26,491 --> 00:13:26,852
Scott: Right.

296
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:31,565
Rym: Or you know drunk guy getting into the con and hurting himself.

297
00:13:31,725 --> 00:13:32,046
Rym: Yeah.

298
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:40,358
Rym: And NerdNYC has to worry about being sued because there's people under 18 in a building in New York City and yet this is legal.

299
00:13:40,378 --> 00:13:41,784
Rym: How can this be legal?

300
00:13:41,804 --> 00:13:46,423
Scott: Yeah so they didn't do it anymore at that particular fair you know this weekend or whatever.

301
00:13:46,483 --> 00:13:48,130
Scott: but I mean are you kidding me?

302
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,054
Rym: What lawyer said?

303
00:13:49,074 --> 00:13:49,978
Rym: you know what that's okay.

304
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:51,084
Scott: What the fuck.

305
00:13:51,546 --> 00:13:52,028
Scott: What do they do.

306
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:54,681
Scott: Yeah but yeah how does the bull feel about running over fire.

307
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:56,048
Scott: They had to helicopter this.

308
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:58,740
Scott: It's not actually fire but it should be fire.

309
00:13:59,102 --> 00:14:00,850
Scott: They had to helicopter this lady to the hospital.

310
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:01,914
Scott: She got fucked up.

311
00:14:02,155 --> 00:14:03,662
Scott: She got stomped by the bull.

312
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:06,392
Scott: It's like oh my god this is horrific you know.

313
00:14:06,814 --> 00:14:14,682
Scott: and the guy that we talked to who had lived in the town he said he just happened to sort of be near it at the time it was happening.

314
00:14:14,722 --> 00:14:16,208
Rym: Wait a minute I got an idea.

315
00:14:16,268 --> 00:14:19,423
Scott: And he's like dude you can't look away but Jesus Christ what the fuck.

316
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:21,232
Rym: I don't know what's more fucked up that.

317
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:22,598
Rym: or here comes honey boo boo.

318
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,326
Scott: This is fucked up anyway.

319
00:14:24,526 --> 00:14:26,054
Rym: Did you watch that South Park video?

320
00:14:26,134 --> 00:14:29,331
Scott: I'm gonna do what I usually do and watch them when they come back onto the website.

321
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:36,489
Rym: Okay all I'm gonna say is I watched that and the whole time I'm thinking I know this is probably actually a real thing but I'm gonna hope to all the gods.

322
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,575
Scott: You didn't know that was a real thing?

323
00:14:37,736 --> 00:14:38,601
Rym: I'd never heard of that.

324
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:40,431
Scott: I actually knew that it was a real thing.

325
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:51,192
Rym: I knew too deep down in my heart I knew but I hoped against hope that they made that up for the show or that at least they were somehow making it appear to be worse than it was.

326
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:51,635
Scott: No they were.

327
00:14:51,896 --> 00:14:52,761
Scott: they're my guess.

328
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:54,329
Scott: I have not seen the South Park episode.

329
00:14:54,349 --> 00:14:54,892
Scott: I've never seen.

330
00:14:55,254 --> 00:14:56,743
Scott: I've never seen the honey boo boo show either.

331
00:14:56,783 --> 00:14:58,532
Scott: I just know it exists and sort of what it is.

332
00:14:58,552 --> 00:14:59,717
Rym: You're gonna like this episode.

333
00:14:59,838 --> 00:15:07,926
Scott: I just have a feeling that they just directly like just animated clips from honey boo boo show in South Park.

334
00:15:08,046 --> 00:15:09,170
Scott: and cuz it needs no help.

335
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:14,117
Rym: You're gonna wait at the end of this episode once you realize the premise cuz he's gonna cut to James Cameron a whole bunch.

336
00:15:14,277 --> 00:15:14,920
Scott: Who's that again?

337
00:15:15,562 --> 00:15:16,185
Rym: Famous director.

338
00:15:16,205 --> 00:15:18,272
Scott: Oh the Terminator 2 director.

339
00:15:18,312 --> 00:15:19,374
Scott: So right?

340
00:15:20,096 --> 00:15:20,757
Rym: James Cameron.

341
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:21,338
Scott: I was right.

342
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,381
Scott: Yeah.

343
00:15:23,483 --> 00:15:29,140
Rym: So when you realize what his plot is this is gonna be one of your favorite South Park episodes.

344
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:36,179
Scott: Can it beat my favorite South Park episodes which are lowercase t?

345
00:15:38,544 --> 00:15:39,606
Scott: Time to leave?

346
00:15:39,626 --> 00:15:40,548
Rym: I don't know.

347
00:15:40,728 --> 00:15:43,515
Rym: I'm mostly a big fan of Scott Tennerman.

348
00:15:43,895 --> 00:15:48,847
Scott: That is also as equal to that lowercase t.

349
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:50,330
Rym: Time to talk about technology.

350
00:15:51,011 --> 00:15:51,814
Scott: So check this out.

351
00:15:51,894 --> 00:15:52,376
Scott: I'm checking.

352
00:15:52,817 --> 00:16:10,360
Scott: What could be so awesome as to bring together the following companies Adobe, Facebook, the Google, HP, Microsoft, Nokia, Mozilla, Opera and supposedly Apple though their logo's not on the website.

353
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:14,479
Rym: They agreed to pull their cash and buy the entire recording and music and movie industries?

354
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:15,684
Scott: No I wish.

355
00:16:15,704 --> 00:16:17,511
Rym: They're gonna buy a senator or ten?

356
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:18,313
Scott: No I wish.

357
00:16:18,554 --> 00:16:37,800
Scott: They made this website called webplatform.org and what it is is basically this website has all the standards for all the webness in a way that's actually readable cuz the w3c is also in on this website cuz they know that their website is basically completely useless for all that kind of shit.

358
00:16:37,841 --> 00:16:47,195
Scott: and whenever you search for something w3 schools end up being like the better result because the w3c site is mostly technical standards that don't actually help anyone with anything.

359
00:16:47,737 --> 00:16:56,325
Scott: so this website webplatform.org right gives you the real information that you actually need in a modern presentation.

360
00:16:56,345 --> 00:17:03,769
Scott: you know that is that is viewable by human beings and has a forum has a blog it has tutorials.

361
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:04,431
Scott: it has everything.

362
00:17:04,471 --> 00:17:15,083
Scott: so if you want to make the websites right no longer do you have to go to w3.org no longer do you have to go to w3 schools.

363
00:17:15,144 --> 00:17:17,029
Scott: you can go to webplatform.org.

364
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:21,126
Scott: this is the new website that all of the web companies pretty much have the hands in.

365
00:17:21,146 --> 00:17:25,684
Scott: you know giving it the thumbs up they realize there's something they need to work together on.

366
00:17:25,704 --> 00:17:30,826
Scott: I wish some of the other industries could work together as nicely but they haven't.

367
00:17:31,026 --> 00:17:38,977
Scott: but at least we have this one thing and it is it's gonna be a website that I'm I know I'll be visiting frequently for years probably.

368
00:17:39,077 --> 00:17:46,523
Scott: so get it out while you can don't be one of those people who like finds out about it a year later saying where's this been all my life?

369
00:17:47,507 --> 00:17:48,270
Scott: it's here today.

370
00:17:48,511 --> 00:17:50,280
Scott: so today is the day you start using it.

371
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:51,686
Scott: and so yet about those other sites.

372
00:17:51,787 --> 00:17:59,478
Rym: so very briefly speaking of the web there was the somewhat famous rumble between Jon Stewart and Bill O'Reilly online and it's Monday.

373
00:17:59,498 --> 00:18:00,823
Scott: do they have a name for it?

374
00:18:00,924 --> 00:18:03,112
Scott: like the rumble 2012 the thriller in vanilla?

375
00:18:03,554 --> 00:18:07,185
Rym: it was the rumble in the air-conditioned auditorium not the rumble in the jungle.

376
00:18:07,206 --> 00:18:17,055
Rym: Jon Stewart had a platform but yeah so you know not to talk about the threats you mean a podium and a lectern.

377
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:19,805
Rym: he has a podium lectern and platform.

378
00:18:20,046 --> 00:18:21,693
Scott: the platform is what he stands on because he's short.

379
00:18:21,853 --> 00:18:24,425
Rym: well he's on a podium and O'Reilly is taller than him.

380
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:33,776
Rym: yes and he's a little Jew not to talk about the politics of it but I would vote for either one of them over our current offerings.

381
00:18:33,816 --> 00:18:38,535
Scott: well I mean why can't the current the current offerings are fully capable of debating in that fashion?

382
00:18:38,795 --> 00:18:39,759
Rym: yes we need someone.

383
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:46,884
Rym: they just refuse to do so with one single metallic testicle or ovary to run the debate and to call their bullshit.

384
00:18:47,104 --> 00:18:50,558
Rym: granted they ignored the fuck out of the moderator in this but it worked out okay.

385
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,446
Rym: oh really they actually debated.

386
00:18:52,586 --> 00:18:52,968
Scott: that's good.

387
00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:55,358
Rym: in fact they debated harder than I think she wanted them to.

388
00:18:55,699 --> 00:19:04,431
Rym: but anyway it's supposed to be streamed online and I thought about streaming it online and Emily actually paid for it to be able to stream it online.

389
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:06,177
Scott: oh it's not free to stream online.

390
00:19:06,398 --> 00:19:08,927
Scott: no but I thought it was a free stream.

391
00:19:09,088 --> 00:19:10,594
Rym: no but they donate the money to charity.

392
00:19:10,895 --> 00:19:13,205
Scott: I still asked for my money back even though it's charity.

393
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:14,851
Rym: why would you ask for your money back?

394
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:16,255
Scott: because it didn't fucking work.

395
00:19:16,315 --> 00:19:18,440
Scott: so chicken dinner.

396
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:24,175
Scott: so here's what happened stream didn't fucking work.

397
00:19:24,256 --> 00:19:24,898
Scott: no shit.

398
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:28,448
Scott: so gonna watch on the illegal pirate streaming site.

399
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:33,995
Rym: so we waited later that day cuz they'd also promised you get like a limited right to remix and you get all these rights if you buy it.

400
00:19:34,317 --> 00:19:35,241
Scott: I can just go in pirate bang.

401
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:36,366
Scott: get all the rights right.

402
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:45,141
Rym: well like quotes yeah but anyway they also let you download it with like HD quality from the website as soon as they from pirate bay also so that you so whatever.

403
00:19:45,281 --> 00:19:46,626
Rym: so we don't go to download it.

404
00:19:46,948 --> 00:19:49,015
Rym: the download site doesn't fucking work in Chrome.

405
00:19:49,035 --> 00:19:50,360
Scott: I thought the download site worked.

406
00:19:50,641 --> 00:19:51,544
Scott: no not in Chrome.

407
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:57,105
Rym: we go to Firefox and we fuck around and get it to work and then we download high quality.

408
00:19:57,426 --> 00:19:59,895
Rym: the video is encoded for fuck and didn't even work.

409
00:19:59,915 --> 00:20:02,744
Rym: so I downloaded like the medium quality.

410
00:20:02,965 --> 00:20:08,843
Rym: friendly medium quality is code for bullshit quality like they encoded the first party.

411
00:20:08,863 --> 00:20:09,765
Scott: you even see.

412
00:20:09,805 --> 00:20:09,946
Scott: here's.

413
00:20:09,966 --> 00:20:20,139
Scott: the thing right is when you try to do something legally as soon as you hit roadblock number one you're supposed to go down the detour points directly at the pirate ship.

414
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:24,028
Scott: all detour signs point to pirate ship.

415
00:20:24,128 --> 00:20:29,050
Scott: if I pay for something in this one and I hit the detour sign I asked my money back and I get on the pirate ship.

416
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,515
Rym: so I want to talk about something.

417
00:20:30,816 --> 00:20:38,039
Rym: because it failed and from what I can gather they didn't use any normal venue for streaming.

418
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:44,157
Rym: they hired some company that according to some tweet I saw doesn't even have a Twitter account so no one could add them.

419
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:54,059
Rym: yeah and uh basically why didn't they use I don't know Amazon video Vimeo you

420
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,365
Scott: YouTube YouTube

421
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:06,627
Rym: of the dozens of already existing perfectly functional use twitch TV events things that exist and I think I know why

422
00:21:06,948 --> 00:21:11,542
Scott: whoever is in technology is dumb or someone paid them to use something.

423
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:14,733
Rym: I think there are only two possible answers here.

424
00:21:14,813 --> 00:21:15,636
Scott: they didn't want it to work.

425
00:21:15,736 --> 00:21:18,346
Rym: answer number one the Hulu situation.

426
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:24,948
Rym: they don't want it to work because of the money cow of the existing infrastructure of distributing television.

427
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:34,841
Rym: the fact that the Daily Show is watched more by people online than on TV probably worries a lot of people and I know the networks want desperately for Hulu to fail and disappear.

428
00:21:36,164 --> 00:21:40,517
Rym: or to the people who run Viacom and Comedy Central and all that.

429
00:21:40,537 --> 00:21:42,344
Rym: they don't you know.

430
00:21:42,424 --> 00:21:46,376
Rym: maybe they don't want the internet to succeed but simultaneously they're dumb.

431
00:21:47,158 --> 00:21:54,625
Rym: so they thought didn't realize how popular the stream would be and hired this bullshit company because they just didn't know better.

432
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:58,946
Rym: so it's either incompetence and that on that particular I'm leaning towards incompetence.

433
00:21:59,227 --> 00:22:25,932
Scott: whoever whoever made the decision of what to do here in the technology side was either incompetent or there was someone above you know someone above them who actually made the decision was non-technical and made it based for some other reason like this company paid for the rights to do it but it was incapable and somebody told the tech department this is the people who are gonna do it no matter what because we have a deal with them or it's my buddy who's runs this company or something like that and they forced some decision.

434
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:36,659
Scott: that was not good but anyway things of the day.

435
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:42,454
Rym: so there's nothing I like more than industrial accidents really no in particular.

436
00:22:43,116 --> 00:22:51,020
Rym: so there's a certain type of accident that can happen in a certain form of metal smelting and shaping and whatever.

437
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:56,406
Rym: I'm not really an expert on this stuff no but this is a particular kind of accident that is actually somewhat common.

438
00:22:57,108 --> 00:22:59,900
Rym: so the two things I will say is in both of these videos no one gets hurt.

439
00:23:00,261 --> 00:23:04,780
Scott: mm-hmm that's good they're hilarious and unlike the bull riding video or many people get hurt.

440
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:15,511
Rym: they're also fascinating to watch and if you want to know why they don't just turn it off the answer is you might as well just let it do its things.

441
00:23:15,571 --> 00:23:19,405
Rym: if you turn it off you got to cut that shit out of the machine and it can take days.

442
00:23:19,806 --> 00:23:21,352
Scott: well it is metal it's hard to cut.

443
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:32,803
Rym: but when you watch this I mean there's one video they call it lightsaber factory has an accident and you'll see why when you watch the metals probably like it's probably making like a rod of metal and it's probably still hot so it's glowing.

444
00:23:32,883 --> 00:23:35,899
Rym: what's cool is I think this is in Poland and the workers are just laughing.

445
00:23:35,939 --> 00:23:39,089
Rym: if like ah ha ha ha oh my god one guy whose fault was it?

446
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,714
Scott: it's obviously not the laughing guys fault.

447
00:23:42,499 --> 00:23:43,584
Scott: I know whose fault it wasn't.

448
00:23:44,026 --> 00:23:46,356
Rym: now unrelatedly have you ever seen a movie called the machinist?

449
00:23:46,818 --> 00:23:47,260
Scott: I heard of it.

450
00:23:47,481 --> 00:23:47,942
Rym: it's pretty good.

451
00:23:48,183 --> 00:23:50,409
Rym: you should see it okay anyway.

452
00:23:51,011 --> 00:23:52,315
Scott: so check this out checking.

453
00:23:52,977 --> 00:24:02,349
Scott: we sort of know especially from my game theory and stuff like that that human beings seem to have this sense of fairness right like you know there's the old.

454
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:05,722
Rym: is the ultimatum game the ultimatum game the all right Scott?

455
00:24:06,103 --> 00:24:07,609
Rym: I'm gonna give you ten grand.

456
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:12,389
Rym: you decide how to split that up between you and Emily and then Emily either says yes or no to the deal.

457
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,976
Scott: if she says yes we split it.

458
00:24:14,016 --> 00:24:17,729
Scott: if we say no if she says no neither of us get any money right now.

459
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:25,873
Scott: so if I give Emily a dollar and keep the rest she should say yes because if she says no she gets zero.

460
00:24:25,914 --> 00:24:27,418
Scott: she says yes she gets one.

461
00:24:27,719 --> 00:24:29,706
Scott: what does it matter to her how much I get right.

462
00:24:29,987 --> 00:24:31,634
Scott: she's dumb if she ever says anything.

463
00:24:31,674 --> 00:24:33,361
Scott: but yes no matter how much the split is.

464
00:24:33,642 --> 00:24:40,247
Rym: now again this assumes a lot of alternate utility like maybe you getting that extra money over her gives you more leverage.

465
00:24:40,307 --> 00:24:43,380
Scott: okay yeah it's like if I was if I was the competing business.

466
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,411
Scott: we owned grocery stores in the opposite side of the street.

467
00:24:45,431 --> 00:24:49,592
Scott: yeah then she should say no but the principal assuming only that we're getting money.

468
00:24:49,653 --> 00:24:51,139
Scott: she should not care how much money I get.

469
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,027
Rym: the principle sound in the in the ultimatum game.

470
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:59,352
Rym: if all actors act rationally and then their own pure self-interest then there's an outcome that can be expected.

471
00:24:59,413 --> 00:25:05,256
Scott: but as we know when humans are on this game are fucking stupid because people will say no if you split the money unfairly.

472
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:12,972
Rym: if people in real or even if they won't people are afraid the other person will say no and spill it equally because they're afraid of not getting any money right.

473
00:25:13,032 --> 00:25:17,591
Scott: it's like they're afraid that the other person is gonna say no if they don't give a flare split.

474
00:25:17,611 --> 00:25:22,749
Scott: or flare split fair split or the other person will say no if the split isn't fair.

475
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:26,966
Scott: so their fear is is you know is good if you think the other person is dumb and won't say yes.

476
00:25:27,087 --> 00:25:30,662
Rym: now if you think as a human you would say yes in those situations.

477
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:38,106
Rym: I I simply ask you this if you say remember the days of dig how often did you just vote something down versus burying it?

478
00:25:38,126 --> 00:25:40,192
Rym: hmm anyway yeah anyway.

479
00:25:40,814 --> 00:25:45,933
Scott: so what they did is they said huh well people seem to have this sense of fairness right and they'll.

480
00:25:45,974 --> 00:25:49,831
Scott: they will act irrationally because they believe in some sort of fairness.

481
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:51,599
Scott: you know where does this fairness come from?

482
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:57,502
Scott: and the question is do animals that aren't people have this sense of fairness right and that's sort of you know.

483
00:25:57,542 --> 00:26:06,255
Scott: the reason we do these kinds of tests and ask the question about animals is to see if is this a cultural societal thing or is this a genetic thing?

484
00:26:06,295 --> 00:26:07,419
Scott: is it nature or nurture?

485
00:26:07,459 --> 00:26:15,149
Scott: and doing a test on animals to see if they have the same sense of fairness is a good way of determining whether in fairness is nurture or nature.

486
00:26:15,169 --> 00:26:18,360
Scott: it's not absolute but it's you know it's a good way to test it.

487
00:26:18,401 --> 00:26:28,453
Scott: so this guy has done this test with a bunch of different animals dogs birds right parrots but he first did the test with capuchin monkeys which are very good monkeys.

488
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:29,377
Rym: they're very cute

489
00:26:29,858 --> 00:26:42,795
Scott: and here is the video of him doing this test with monkeys and instead of doing money they basically have the monkeys do work and they reward one monkey for the work with grapes and they reward the other monkey with cucumbers and the cucumber monkey thinks he's getting.

490
00:26:43,056 --> 00:26:47,057
Scott: uh he's not getting a fair deal because the other guy's getting grapes which are way better than cucumbers.

491
00:26:47,078 --> 00:26:51,237
Rym: what scott said to me when he showed this to me was you're not gonna believe how this monkey acts.

492
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:54,856
Scott: it looks like he's acting like a trained monkey from a movie like you would think.

493
00:26:54,896 --> 00:26:57,990
Scott: the scientific study was fixed and it's some sort of like you know.

494
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:03,451
Scott: uh one of those scientific scams to you know get published and uh you know fake papers and things like that.

495
00:27:03,551 --> 00:27:06,601
Scott: but uh i mean he is a monkey right.

496
00:27:06,642 --> 00:27:09,211
Scott: so uh just this video is unbelievable.

497
00:27:09,512 --> 00:27:10,416
Scott: the monkey is awesome.

498
00:27:10,436 --> 00:27:11,279
Scott: i mean awesome monkeys.

499
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:12,142
Scott: that's all i gotta tell.

500
00:27:12,182 --> 00:27:14,067
Scott: i should have just said awesome monkeys watch my video.

501
00:27:14,088 --> 00:27:18,682
Rym: this would have been monkey tuesday.

502
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:19,244
Scott: is it tuesday?

503
00:27:19,344 --> 00:27:20,388
Scott: no it's monday.

504
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:24,402
Scott: it is monday but most people are going to be listening to this episode on tuesday.

505
00:27:24,422 --> 00:27:27,630
Scott: the people listen right away at least.

506
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:35,217
Rym: so now briefly in the meta moment uh if you want to go to pax east buy your fucking badge they're going to sell out any minute.

507
00:27:35,438 --> 00:27:42,245
Scott: in fact if you're listening to this right now probably too late now they actually have not sold out yet and i think they raised the cap.

508
00:27:42,265 --> 00:27:42,968
Scott: that's my guess.

509
00:27:43,048 --> 00:27:45,557
Rym: i am amazed that they have not sold out yet.

510
00:27:45,617 --> 00:27:48,067
Rym: now most of the hotels are sold out already.

511
00:27:48,087 --> 00:27:49,393
Scott: that's the thing.

512
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:51,040
Scott: is they might have more badges that they.

513
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:57,286
Scott: it's like they might be able to fit more people in the convention center than there are hotel rooms and and such.

514
00:27:57,346 --> 00:27:58,250
Scott: so we'll see what happens.

515
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:58,933
Scott: it'll be interesting.

516
00:27:59,455 --> 00:28:06,584
Scott: but i guess that means like if the hotels sell out but they still have badges that means a lot of the people who are local get to go or as other people don't.

517
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:14,409
Rym: i gotta find out what the deal is because the either the cap was raised or something happened because i cannot believe it did not sell out already.

518
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,018
Scott: maybe just the time.

519
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:23,043
Rym: however several people in the organization have basically tweeted like guys seriously you should buy them zoom.

520
00:28:23,103 --> 00:28:28,144
Scott: so i think they're close to selling out and their site did not like crash or anything weird like yeah that was.

521
00:28:28,244 --> 00:28:32,199
Rym: one thing with prime is that the site crashed and then it came back later.

522
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,224
Rym: so there's all these problems.

523
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:40,673
Rym: i guess their technical issues are fixed which is good and also east can hold a lot more people than prime but there is higher total demand.

524
00:28:41,356 --> 00:28:46,560
Rym: but i saw a lot of people who are tweeting things like oh i gotta buy my badge but i don't have any money.

525
00:28:47,661 --> 00:28:51,298
Scott: well that you have a credit card genius and if you can't afford it well then that's.

526
00:28:51,318 --> 00:28:52,001
Scott: uh it's too damn bad.

527
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:52,484
Rym: but anyway yeah.

528
00:28:52,525 --> 00:28:56,285
Rym: but if they're not sold out yet and you want to go to packs buy your badge.

529
00:28:56,365 --> 00:29:02,647
Rym: as soon as you hear these words pause this show right the fuck now and buy your badge even though it's probably too late anyway.

530
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:05,015
Scott: uh other meta news.

531
00:29:05,236 --> 00:29:06,902
Scott: you should follow us on the internet.

532
00:29:06,922 --> 00:29:08,309
Scott: what places do you like on the internet?

533
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:18,696
Scott: think about websites you use all the time when go to that website the next time look for us on there look for GeekNights look for front row crew if it's facebook's twitter's whatever it is look for us and follow us.

534
00:29:18,736 --> 00:29:20,342
Scott: you can also go to gasp.

535
00:29:20,683 --> 00:29:22,951
Scott: uh frontrowcrew.com if you really want to.

536
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:26,563
Scott: yeah and there might be links to the places you can follow us.

537
00:29:26,643 --> 00:29:27,567
Scott: and other handy.

538
00:29:27,627 --> 00:29:29,755
Scott: more importantly we have related information.

539
00:29:29,775 --> 00:29:36,500
Rym: we uploaded part two of the three-part lecture we did at pecs prime in seattle this year a competitive test of skill.

540
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:43,403
Rym: uh as soon as i finish editing it i'm uploading the third and final part on the ethics of mind control.

541
00:29:43,643 --> 00:29:51,444
Scott: and just so you know the book club book selection as of now has changed since uh two episodes ago of GeekNights.

542
00:29:51,544 --> 00:30:09,271
Scott: it is now the name of the wind by patrick ruffus and i have begun reading it and it is a fantasy novel that is very excellent and it contains many themes seen in previous fantasy novels uh such as earthsea and many others.

543
00:30:09,552 --> 00:30:19,279
Scott: so uh if you're a fantasy person who likes to play fantasy video games or read fantasy books you should read this book club book.

544
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:23,129
Scott: in fact uh and i'm basing that on less than 25 of the book.

545
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,715
Rym: so now on pax east.

546
00:30:25,776 --> 00:30:31,193
Rym: apparently it was uh pax east was trending both globally and in the u.s.

547
00:30:31,514 --> 00:30:36,611
Rym: well this doesn't have to compete with much today yeah and is continuing to trend on some more local things.

548
00:30:36,692 --> 00:30:42,307
Rym: so uh we're serious buy them soon good okay.

549
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:46,335
Scott: so uh check this out right i'm checking.

550
00:30:46,515 --> 00:30:48,739
Scott: people have been worried for a long time.

551
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:57,243
Scott: it has been sort of a theoretical worry that you know there could be a intentional security vulnerability in hardware.

552
00:30:57,283 --> 00:31:01,941
Scott: right because when you buy a computer you know you can't really modify the hardware itself.

553
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:03,930
Scott: like you can choose different combinations of parts.

554
00:31:04,453 --> 00:31:04,714
Scott: right.

555
00:31:05,035 --> 00:31:10,315
Scott: but you're not too much worried about the 1989 batman joker like oh use it in video with this chipset.

556
00:31:10,376 --> 00:31:11,841
Scott: oh no that doesn't happen right?

557
00:31:12,263 --> 00:31:13,126
Scott: you're worried about.

558
00:31:13,407 --> 00:31:15,033
Scott: you know that chip was made by nvidia.

559
00:31:15,154 --> 00:31:19,811
Scott: if nvidia was shady they could put something in that chip right that you have no control over.

560
00:31:20,132 --> 00:31:25,350
Scott: that is a threat to you and there's nothing you can do about it except not use nvidia right.

561
00:31:26,032 --> 00:31:38,736
Scott: and the real question is so many of these chips are made in china and other places that those countries and those companies that run those factories could be the ones to to worry about doing something like this.

562
00:31:38,877 --> 00:31:40,261
Scott: so you might not know.

563
00:31:40,322 --> 00:31:49,151
Scott: but like the u.s defense department when they buy computers and other devices for the military they don't put like chinese chips in stealth bombers.

564
00:31:49,351 --> 00:31:58,098
Scott: yeah right they find they make at a much much higher cost uh chips in the united states with companies that they trust.

565
00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:02,055
Rym: in fact i worked in factories that were involved in some of that for uh many years.

566
00:32:02,156 --> 00:32:03,823
Scott: yeah it's like they will not you know.

567
00:32:03,904 --> 00:32:06,960
Scott: it's like we could save a lot of fucking money if we would just buy some chips.

568
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,690
Scott: you know intel chips or whatever but they're made in china.

569
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,838
Scott: so no most of them are anyway.

570
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:17,692
Scott: so they're not gonna put those like a core 2 duo inside the space shuttle or uh you know an f-22.

571
00:32:17,732 --> 00:32:23,149
Rym: because now there was a pipeline explosion one of the.

572
00:32:23,269 --> 00:32:33,946
Rym: i think it was the biggest non-nuclear explosion russia right in human history in russia which was caused by us the united states providing fake uh sabotage chips to the russians.

573
00:32:34,247 --> 00:32:37,198
Scott: yep but see that was more of a situation of like.

574
00:32:37,298 --> 00:32:38,302
Scott: you know fake chips.

575
00:32:38,363 --> 00:32:39,106
Scott: like you know the.

576
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:42,723
Scott: there are chips that like would pass the test but wouldn't actually do what they're supposed to do.

577
00:32:42,743 --> 00:32:43,687
Scott: i don't know.

578
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:48,628
Scott: but anyway we're talking more about like you know normal modern computer chips that sort of.

579
00:32:48,889 --> 00:32:54,492
Scott: they do what they're supposed to do and they appear to work and they're functioning but there's some sort of back door.

580
00:32:54,573 --> 00:33:00,016
Scott: so like you know you could have a computer install clean windows you don't detect any viruses everything works.

581
00:33:00,016 --> 00:33:02,004
Scott: 100 you know there's no problems with your computer.

582
00:33:02,425 --> 00:33:25,475
Scott: but some dude if he wants to can somehow get into your computer and steal your data because you're on the hardware level where your software can't even see shady businesses going on like for example you could make a network card all right with a network card chip that you know looks at all the packets that are being sent out and duplicates those packets and sends them to some ip address.

583
00:33:25,515 --> 00:33:27,122
Scott: and you would not know this was happening.

584
00:33:27,202 --> 00:33:40,000
Scott: unless you use like wireshark to on a separate computer on the network to you know to look at your network traffic that was going out which means most people would have no fucking clue what was happening right except their internet would be half as fast on the upload.

585
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,671
Rym: because uploading your packets is this a legitimate concern or not?

586
00:33:45,814 --> 00:33:48,600
Scott: it's not a big concern.

587
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:59,192
Scott: it's not something you should should keep you up at night but it is theoretically possible and it is if you're it is kind of possible.

588
00:33:59,312 --> 00:34:04,931
Rym: the reason we're talking about this because the government in the united states straight up banned a specific chinese company.

589
00:34:05,232 --> 00:34:08,943
Scott: u.s government rules hui y a security threat.

590
00:34:09,203 --> 00:34:12,733
Rym: i think it's huawei is it?

591
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:15,119
Rym: i think so okay whatever whatever they.

592
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:16,924
Scott: however you i think let's call it hawaii.

593
00:34:16,944 --> 00:34:21,255
Scott: i don't care right who it's h-u-a-w-e-i.

594
00:34:21,315 --> 00:34:24,947
Scott: i'm sorry that i am to not know how to pronounce romanized chinese.

595
00:34:24,967 --> 00:34:25,710
Scott: i think it's huawei.

596
00:34:25,891 --> 00:34:31,510
Scott: i apologize we'll call it huawei because that is less syllables from now on and it sounds more chinese.

597
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:35,222
Scott: so it's on you sounds more chinese.

598
00:34:35,322 --> 00:34:36,004
Scott: it does right?

599
00:34:36,063 --> 00:34:38,793
Scott: could i mean huawei sounds more japanese?

600
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:40,578
Scott: right just really huawei.

601
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:41,120
Scott: right.

602
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:44,194
Scott: well because i mean think about it's like uh what yotsuba's name is koei y?

603
00:34:44,596 --> 00:34:46,764
Scott: right yotsuba koei y so it's anyway.

604
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,007
Scott: this would be huawei anyway.

605
00:34:48,951 --> 00:34:49,654
Scott: yeah huawei.

606
00:34:49,734 --> 00:34:51,500
Scott: sure huawei sounds more chinese whatever.

607
00:34:53,061 --> 00:34:59,262
Scott: so the u.s congress after a very very long investigation this wasn't like just something they decided.

608
00:34:59,663 --> 00:34:59,924
Scott: right?

609
00:35:00,747 --> 00:35:14,952
Scott: uh the draft of a report by the house intelligence committee said that hui huawei and another chinese telecom zte quote cannot be trusted to be free of influence from beijing and could be used to undermine u.s security.

610
00:35:14,992 --> 00:35:16,257
Scott: so we don't know.

611
00:35:16,318 --> 00:35:17,844
Rym: well there's more to it than that.

612
00:35:17,984 --> 00:35:22,922
Rym: the 59 page report cited a bunch of issues including let's see bribery whatever.

613
00:35:23,624 --> 00:35:31,226
Rym: and there was a second report unpublished because it was classified and only discussed within congress behind closed doors.

614
00:35:31,748 --> 00:35:35,180
Rym: that appears to have specific evidence of malicious implants.

615
00:35:35,441 --> 00:35:36,605
Scott: okay see that's the thing right.

616
00:35:36,645 --> 00:35:42,566
Scott: so in the public view on you know of this draft of a report which is you know pretty close to a final report.

617
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:52,689
Scott: uh it says that basically these companies are basically doing whatever the chinese government tells them to and the chinese government is telling probably telling them to do shady things.

618
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:57,007
Scott: so we can't really trust the hardware these companies put out to be.

619
00:35:57,228 --> 00:35:58,814
Scott: you know to not it's like.

620
00:35:58,854 --> 00:36:01,444
Scott: why would the chinese government telling these companies to do anything right?

621
00:36:01,685 --> 00:36:05,542
Scott: so you can't really trust their hardware to be free of influence of the chinese government.

622
00:36:05,804 --> 00:36:09,863
Scott: so you probably shouldn't use it in an application that you don't want the chinese government to influence.

623
00:36:10,225 --> 00:36:14,620
Scott: and the hidden report says yes actually they did something to these chips.

624
00:36:14,961 --> 00:36:17,212
Scott: so don't use them in any machine that you are making.

625
00:36:17,232 --> 00:36:18,739
Scott: that you worry about security.

626
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,084
Rym: at least we're assuming it is.

627
00:36:20,104 --> 00:36:22,132
Rym: a lot of this is speculation.

628
00:36:22,192 --> 00:36:23,738
Scott: well it could also be this point.

629
00:36:23,858 --> 00:36:32,283
Scott: it could be propaganda by the congress attempting to you know get u.s companies to not buy chips from these chinese companies.

630
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,531
Scott: you know conspiracy theories galore.

631
00:36:34,852 --> 00:36:35,755
Scott: oh lordy right.

632
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:38,444
Scott: um but yeah this is feasible.

633
00:36:38,786 --> 00:36:39,970
Scott: it could very well be true.

634
00:36:40,452 --> 00:36:43,345
Scott: they could do all sorts of stuff and it says it's a telecommunications company.

635
00:36:43,365 --> 00:36:44,229
Scott: so it could be like.

636
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:52,763
Scott: you know it could be cell phone radio chips it could be all kinds of you know chips that would be very networking chips are much easier to target with this sort of thing.

637
00:36:52,783 --> 00:36:54,631
Rym: well imagine then say cpus.

638
00:36:54,671 --> 00:37:07,519
Rym: the thing is imagine an outright malicious chip that has uh firmware encoded in it somewhere that's hidden or chips even just physical circuits that are primed to when given a certain signal fuck the fuck up right all simultaneously.

639
00:37:07,539 --> 00:37:10,430
Scott: it's like you couldn't really do much to ram right.

640
00:37:10,511 --> 00:37:11,695
Scott: that would be a problem.

641
00:37:11,715 --> 00:37:20,268
Rym: you know i wouldn't be too worried about this in practicality except for the fact that as we pointed out in the beginning not much of this stuff is made in the u.s anymore.

642
00:37:20,328 --> 00:37:33,637
Rym: and two china and russia have basically for all intents and purposes been the bad guys on the world stage lately in terms of uh preventing intervention in serious situations uh vetoing anytime the un wants to do anything good.

643
00:37:33,657 --> 00:37:46,739
Rym: yeah i mean they've been the bad guys as far as the u.s government is concerned yeah but lately they've china's been pretty shitty on the international stage lately in general yeah never mind the free speech issues and all that.

644
00:37:46,759 --> 00:37:49,549
Scott: it's just the way it is man.

645
00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:51,336
Scott: but yeah we only care about the technology part.

646
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:59,223
Scott: and the technology part says i would probably not want to buy anything that had a huawei or zte chip in it based on this report.

647
00:37:59,283 --> 00:38:02,754
Scott: i mean you know it's it's like you know i can.

648
00:38:02,895 --> 00:38:04,220
Scott: i'm pretty good at maint.

649
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,214
Scott: you know keeping my software secure and you know things like that.

650
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:09,889
Scott: but if there's something in the hardware there's nothing i can do about it.

651
00:38:09,929 --> 00:38:10,512
Scott: what am i you know?

652
00:38:10,533 --> 00:38:12,703
Scott: and if i find out it's like what am i supposed to do?

653
00:38:12,744 --> 00:38:13,548
Scott: buy a new motherboard?

654
00:38:13,568 --> 00:38:23,321
Rym: now i will consider the uh the current initiatives towards secure boot and the signing and everything to be just as viable in terms of a intrusion mechanism.

655
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,266
Rym: the fact that i don't.

656
00:38:25,587 --> 00:38:29,204
Rym: as soon as i have physical hardware i should have the right to have full control over it.

657
00:38:29,365 --> 00:38:35,271
Scott: yeah because think about it you might have the ability to maybe do a firmware update and fix what everything china did to your chip.

658
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:36,194
Scott: theoretically maybe.

659
00:38:36,675 --> 00:38:58,658
Scott: but if you have secure boot right uh and that's locked into like one operating system or who knows what or you know other uh secure software mechanisms that that prevent unsigned software from being executed you might not physically be able to execute that firmware update because it is not signed properly and you're not cryptographically capable of signing it and getting it to run on your computer.

660
00:38:58,678 --> 00:39:01,933
Scott: so you can't do the firmware update to fix the security hole.

661
00:39:02,254 --> 00:39:02,837
Scott: so there's a bat.

662
00:39:02,877 --> 00:39:04,645
Scott: not only is there a back door on your computer.

663
00:39:04,906 --> 00:39:13,240
Scott: it's one that cannot be fixed because the people who put it there run the hardware and control what software you can put and then you're in a real bad shape now.

664
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,698
Rym: the reason i bring that up is because you all remember the cbd tpa which you know.

665
00:39:17,718 --> 00:39:30,038
Rym: for everyone who fought sopa and all these things the cbd tpa was pretty much the big bad mother of them all and in terms you know i was just dissing china and russia for being kind of dicks on the international stage.

666
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,709
Rym: the u.s is also pretty bad on this front.

667
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:35,278
Scott: yeah if you're china are you gonna trust chips made in the u.s?

668
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,486
Rym: or would you imagine in the u.s?

669
00:39:37,928 --> 00:39:45,472
Rym: if the cbd tpa had passed i would have had to get my chips from non-us sources because the u.s chips couldn't be trusted to.

670
00:39:45,492 --> 00:39:46,736
Rym: let me watch my own movies.

671
00:39:47,278 --> 00:39:48,882
Scott: that's true very true.

672
00:39:49,665 --> 00:40:01,941
Rym: so it's a complex issue partly because anyone with knowledge or a willingness to seek out knowledge as long as the bottom of maslow's hierarchy you know they've got food and water and shelter.

673
00:40:01,961 --> 00:40:06,322
Rym: as long as they have those you can learn how to program and you can program anything.

674
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,976
Rym: the limit is really just your own willingness intelligence effort and ability.

675
00:40:10,879 --> 00:40:15,374
Rym: but hardware has a much higher barrier to entry for obvious reasons.

676
00:40:15,394 --> 00:40:25,196
Scott: yeah you can go online and read websites and learn how to design hardware and all things right and you can go to radio shack and put together all sorts of crazy circuits and things but they will be slow.

677
00:40:25,216 --> 00:40:33,986
Scott: you could theoretically build uh theoretically right like a core two duo from pieces if you had enough pieces radio shacks but it would be so slow.

678
00:40:34,006 --> 00:40:38,640
Scott: it would be ridiculously slow because it'd be so big and require so much energy and right.

679
00:40:38,941 --> 00:40:51,687
Scott: so uh you know the you need to do to be able to actually make modern hardware is you need a fab and you need a modern fab right and that is incredibly expensive and difficult and requires a bunch of people.

680
00:40:51,727 --> 00:40:56,724
Scott: and basically you need a factory and you don't have one and you never will and they're all in china mostly.

681
00:40:56,744 --> 00:40:58,851
Scott: uh so good luck.

682
00:40:59,273 --> 00:41:08,006
Scott: you know even you know people like richard stolman who are crazy about free software depend on some factory somewhere fabricating the chips to go in his laptop.

683
00:41:08,146 --> 00:41:11,460
Scott: yeah the hardware and he sees to trust what that you know those people make.

684
00:41:11,561 --> 00:41:22,805
Rym: the hardware of computing is kind of like the medium upon which all of our modern ideas and everything we've built up as nerds in the society is really built on top of this fabric of hardware and electricity.

685
00:41:22,825 --> 00:41:23,628
Scott: now think about this.

686
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:31,297
Scott: you know he will go and get like a cpu that is completely open and has like its plans published somewhere and has like an open architecture and stuff like that.

687
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:39,730
Scott: how does he know that the chip that's in his computer is actually matching those that pdf with the documents that you know describe the architecture?

688
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,156
Scott: i mean sure it works.

689
00:41:41,437 --> 00:41:49,230
Scott: you know from his software interacting perspective he sends it assembly instructions and it behaves according to the way that those documents say it should behave.

690
00:41:49,792 --> 00:41:51,016
Scott: but there could be something in here.

691
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:52,200
Scott: he there he doesn't know.

692
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,504
Scott: and then what?

693
00:41:53,986 --> 00:42:03,621
Scott: even the craziest free software guy i mean you'd have to literally take a scanning electron microscope to the chip to see if it matches the piece of paper that says what's on the chip.

694
00:42:03,882 --> 00:42:08,905
Scott: now you'd have to be and not only that you would have to be able to understand what you're fucking looking at.

695
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:17,715
Rym: you know that's an interesting point because think about this to a non super technologist the code of their computer is just as obtuse.

696
00:42:17,775 --> 00:42:19,561
Rym: i mean you can go to sourceforge.

697
00:42:19,601 --> 00:42:26,466
Rym: there's a lot of shit dangerous software out there but if you don't know you have to trust someone who tells you oh no it's good

698
00:42:26,968 --> 00:42:31,951
Scott: it's the same as when you go to the doctor and he tells you you need to take this medicine because you have the flu.

699
00:42:32,272 --> 00:42:35,325
Scott: how do you know you don't have pneumonia or meningitis or it's like.

700
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:40,605
Scott: you can webmd a little bit but you know you're trusting in the doctor and his expert knowledge.

701
00:42:40,665 --> 00:42:49,343
Rym: now when you go there when it comes to open source there's enough eyeballs on it that any moderate to high profile project has enough people watching it to where it's very difficult.

702
00:42:49,403 --> 00:42:52,075
Scott: it's like if you go to 10 doctors and nine of them say flu.

703
00:42:52,095 --> 00:42:54,566
Scott: i think you're pretty sure it's the flu right.

704
00:42:54,607 --> 00:43:01,235
Scott: but when you got open source software there's a hundred people working who are hardcore on this project and a thousand other people who are sort of mid-core on it.

705
00:43:01,356 --> 00:43:09,283
Scott: i mean if a thousand one hundred doctors all say roughly the same thing that that software is trustworthy i think you have the flu.

706
00:43:09,645 --> 00:43:13,097
Rym: but hardware will eventually someday get to be at the same point.

707
00:43:13,117 --> 00:43:17,996
Rym: i mean we will have little fabricators that'll just print chips and then the schematics.

708
00:43:18,076 --> 00:43:32,082
Rym: while they'll be complex the barrier and entry will lower enough to where dedicated people will be able to do the same thing making chips microchips that are fast and up someday up to par with the fastest microchips of the day.

709
00:43:32,202 --> 00:43:36,115
Rym: i'm talking like 40 to 140 years yeah i'm thinking for like 100 years right?

710
00:43:36,135 --> 00:43:42,200
Scott: i mean we'll be able to fab chips that are you know sort of like arduino like kind of slow but they they're chips and they work.

711
00:43:42,542 --> 00:43:45,313
Scott: you know with things like you know maker maker bot of the future

712
00:43:45,334 --> 00:43:57,241
Rym: why does open source pretend pretend we could even if we could just print stuff the the fact remains that the reason open source gets so many eyeballs is that there is no higher authority that can control it.

713
00:43:57,281 --> 00:44:07,382
Rym: so even if you know open source software in china might have the government might you know put bad stuff in software and have control of enough people to where the software is compromised.

714
00:44:07,462 --> 00:44:12,545
Rym: it's very difficult for anyone in china to know or even if they do know well they're saying anything about it right.

715
00:44:12,565 --> 00:44:23,834
Rym: but the thing is if it's same people who use that because it's open source people in the us and people in denmark and people in south africa with all these different governments with different goals can all work from the same base.

716
00:44:23,874 --> 00:44:28,497
Rym: it's highly unlikely that every government in the world is going to want to do the same evil at the same time.

717
00:44:28,518 --> 00:44:37,767
Scott: well there's always the thing with open source right is that there's the source and you can just compile it yourself and then you look at the md5 and you'll do the other guy's md5 and if they're different you know that someone tampered.

718
00:44:37,827 --> 00:44:48,450
Rym: i'm just saying more that even if like if china like strictly controlled software development and controlled the free so that you couldn't do open source in china in china the whole rest of the world exists.

719
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:52,609
Rym: it would take a concerted effort among all the major industrialized nations of the world.

720
00:44:52,629 --> 00:45:00,170
Rym: that's open software but hardware it's really only made in a few places yeah and you can't really do like.

721
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:00,733
Scott: i was saying.

722
00:45:00,894 --> 00:45:04,130
Scott: the reason i brought up the md5 to check to make sure no one tampered your software.

723
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:06,859
Scott: you can't md5 some chip right.

724
00:45:06,919 --> 00:45:08,645
Scott: maybe if it's an fpga you can.

725
00:45:08,865 --> 00:45:10,150
Scott: you could do something right like.

726
00:45:10,531 --> 00:45:17,899
Scott: you can md5 the firmware but you can't md5 the chip itself if there is a physical thing in it there's no checksum on the chip.

727
00:45:17,939 --> 00:45:18,702
Scott: you can perform.

728
00:45:18,722 --> 00:45:20,409
Rym: probably come up with something but maybe

729
00:45:20,469 --> 00:45:31,735
Scott: maybe we have to come up with something right so that you can sort of when you buy hardware you can validate that that hardware is the hardware that you said that you believe it is and has not been tampered with by anyone.

730
00:45:31,755 --> 00:45:34,728
Rym: so here's what i'm getting at the replicators and the printing.

731
00:45:34,848 --> 00:45:38,763
Rym: that is the eventual solution but as we both agree it is a long way out.

732
00:45:39,124 --> 00:45:40,589
Scott: it's farther than google goggles.

733
00:45:40,609 --> 00:45:42,095
Scott: the best case scenario.

734
00:45:42,396 --> 00:45:45,046
Rym: we see the beginnings of that at the end of our lives.

735
00:45:45,066 --> 00:45:46,230
Scott: that's what i'm thinking.

736
00:45:48,272 --> 00:46:02,765
Rym: so the current solution in my opinion is that the united states has to start making goddamn chips again because then in the very least it would take both the chinese government and the u.s government acting together to fuck this up.

737
00:46:02,785 --> 00:46:04,050
Rym: for the rest of us unlikely.

738
00:46:06,992 --> 00:46:07,815
Scott: it's very good you know.

739
00:46:07,836 --> 00:46:16,699
Scott: find something that'll never happen and then set up a situation where the only way we can be fucked is that thing that will never happen happens but that but that's such the obvious solution.

740
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,382
Rym: what all right?

741
00:46:17,422 --> 00:46:18,628
Rym: we need more jobs in the u.s.

742
00:46:18,788 --> 00:46:20,355
Rym: we need more technology in the u.s.

743
00:46:20,817 --> 00:46:26,720
Rym: everything points at this being a solution except the fact that our government is incapable of speaking with themselves.

744
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:31,501
Scott: well the thing is we do make chips in the u.s but they really only go for military contracts.

745
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:36,064
Scott: they don't go for consumer products because then the consumer products would be too expensive and no one would buy them right.

746
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:49,310
Scott: so really the only way in order to make this happen in the u.s specifically we would need to get people in the u.s to be willing to to pay even more for their electronics and to choose more expensive.

747
00:46:50,531 --> 00:46:51,736
Rym: there's a different way to go about it.

748
00:46:51,937 --> 00:46:56,777
Rym: block import of these Chinese now tariffs is one way but i don't think that's the solution either.

749
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:03,833
Rym: so now maybe some aspect of tariffs maybe incur you know incremental tariffs against countries that also have a history of human rights violations.

750
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:07,086
Rym: granted we also have a history of human rights violations recently.

751
00:47:07,147 --> 00:47:08,291
Rym: so uh forget that.

752
00:47:08,371 --> 00:47:18,223
Scott: yep so what if we subsidized the production of chips the united states taking taking our oil subsidy and our farm subsidy make it a chip subsidy.

753
00:47:18,283 --> 00:47:19,851
Scott: now here's the crazy same amount of money.

754
00:47:20,032 --> 00:47:21,760
Rym: here's the crazy idea because it balances.

755
00:47:22,002 --> 00:47:25,938
Rym: this came up during the john stewart bill o'reilly thing and i think it's really this specific issue.

756
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:28,448
Rym: so this same solution but for health care.

757
00:47:28,468 --> 00:47:30,094
Rym: so here's the idea.

758
00:47:30,155 --> 00:47:35,038
Rym: the argument that bill o'reilly made was that our government can run a military because we have a military tradition.

759
00:47:35,279 --> 00:47:36,607
Rym: we can't trust it to run anything else.

760
00:47:36,647 --> 00:47:37,733
Scott: wait because you have a tradition.

761
00:47:37,773 --> 00:47:39,722
Scott: i don't think it's because you have a tradition.

762
00:47:39,743 --> 00:47:40,325
Rym: let me finish.

763
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,157
Rym: his argument was that you know john stewart said so you don't.

764
00:47:43,298 --> 00:47:54,234
Rym: you trust the government to run the greatest most powerful military the world has ever seen but not to run like health care that somehow it's incapable of doing that.

765
00:47:54,535 --> 00:47:59,434
Rym: but yet it can have 16 aircraft carriers and you know floating cities and all this craziness.

766
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:05,039
Rym: and his argument was simply that the government was doing this for you know couple hundred years we got it down by now.

767
00:48:05,481 --> 00:48:06,708
Rym: now forget all the big questions.

768
00:48:06,748 --> 00:48:08,314
Rym: we could argue against that pretty easily.

769
00:48:09,016 --> 00:48:15,716
Rym: so what came out of that discussion was the idea what if we made a military-esque order of doctors?

770
00:48:16,579 --> 00:48:19,407
Rym: we treated health care like we do the military.

771
00:48:19,648 --> 00:48:26,889
Rym: anyone who wants to enlist in the doctor corps gets doctor education and if they pass doctor i'd be a doctor.

772
00:48:26,969 --> 00:48:28,236
Scott: oh no because i barfed for the guts.

773
00:48:28,276 --> 00:48:30,187
Scott: but if i couldn't bar for the guts i would be a doctor.

774
00:48:30,228 --> 00:48:37,492
Rym: but imagine what if we socialized health care but not in all the traditional ways but by making it a civic duty service.

775
00:48:37,512 --> 00:48:41,945
Scott: someone someone in a debate suggested a new idea must not be a politician.

776
00:48:41,965 --> 00:48:45,556
Rym: now think about that idea and what it does.

777
00:48:45,676 --> 00:48:57,866
Rym: suddenly intelligence and earnestness are the primary factors and one thing that our military for all you might complain about it out there in the world is one of the closest things to a meritocracy we've seen in the modern era.

778
00:48:57,966 --> 00:48:58,870
Scott: yeah it's not perfect.

779
00:48:59,151 --> 00:49:01,161
Rym: don't even pretend i'm saying it's perfect.

780
00:49:01,181 --> 00:49:02,487
Scott: well especially the low levels.

781
00:49:02,568 --> 00:49:05,057
Scott: it's mostly you know depending on who you listen to.

782
00:49:05,097 --> 00:49:06,924
Scott: it's all crazed rambo killers.

783
00:49:07,085 --> 00:49:10,319
Scott: no no you know depending in which what part you're talking about.

784
00:49:10,419 --> 00:49:11,806
Rym: i haven't really heard that from anyone.

785
00:49:11,926 --> 00:49:18,106
Scott: i've heard that from like people who are you know in the inventory on the ground in the wars anyway.

786
00:49:18,286 --> 00:49:20,575
Rym: so imagine if we did that for health care.

787
00:49:20,816 --> 00:49:21,439
Rym: imagine if it was.

788
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:25,858
Rym: you know you're in you're a doctor and you have almost like a military order of doctors.

789
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:32,664
Rym: and they even said why don't we take all the you know military doctors who aren't doing anything after we end the two wars and have them build it?

790
00:49:32,684 --> 00:49:40,472
Rym: then why not so anyway if we did something like that with technology surgeon general is a much more important job suddenly.

791
00:49:40,793 --> 00:49:46,228
Rym: so if we subsidized through the government private industry in the u.s.

792
00:49:46,469 --> 00:49:57,796
Rym: or something like that making chips even if they're more expensive now of course we'd be dumping a bunch of tax dollars into it it wouldn't be efficient from a pure no no we'd just be taking the money away from the oil companies on the farm.

793
00:49:57,837 --> 00:49:58,218
Scott: so it even.

794
00:49:58,258 --> 00:49:58,459
Scott: yeah.

795
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:01,150
Rym: but no that's all again a separate argument.

796
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:02,094
Rym: i'm trying to keep this focus.

797
00:50:02,134 --> 00:50:05,869
Rym: yeah so if we do that sure it costs a lot more per chip.

798
00:50:05,909 --> 00:50:15,600
Rym: it's a ridiculous waste of money except that now we're building a generation of engineers and factories and all this infrastructure in the u.s.

799
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:22,850
Rym: in case we need it and all the fringe benefits and all the good things it would do for our society probably more than cancel out the extra cost.

800
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:28,493
Scott: yeah but the problem is we'd have to actually make chips that people would use and buy which is the difficult part.

801
00:50:28,533 --> 00:50:31,182
Rym: yeah i'm talking like intel core i7s.

802
00:50:31,262 --> 00:50:31,643
Rym: fuck it.

803
00:50:31,824 --> 00:50:32,727
Scott: yeah they're not gonna make i7s.

804
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:36,681
Scott: intel's not because no one's gonna buy an i7 if it costs more.

805
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:40,194
Scott: when you buy a chinese i7 you subsidize the production.

806
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:41,359
Scott: uh well you'd have to keep.

807
00:50:41,379 --> 00:50:45,217
Scott: you'd have to increase the subsidy until the price was the same as the chinese price.

808
00:50:45,237 --> 00:50:47,548
Rym: yeah you basically make the price identical and you have.

809
00:50:47,568 --> 00:50:49,094
Scott: that would how the.

810
00:50:49,194 --> 00:50:52,708
Scott: it really depend mathematically on how big the subsidy would have to be.

811
00:50:52,748 --> 00:50:53,953
Scott: that might have to be a you know.

812
00:50:54,315 --> 00:50:58,110
Scott: basically think about the difference in pay between all of the workers.

813
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:02,364
Scott: imagine if you had to pay all the workers at the foxconn factory like u.s wages.

814
00:51:02,384 --> 00:51:11,279
Rym: uh scott so that level of work i remember i worked i supported the production fab at ibm the 200 millimeter and 300 millimeter fabs across multiple sites for many years.

815
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:16,358
Rym: the work at that level doesn't pay that much and isn't that skilled anyway?

816
00:51:16,438 --> 00:51:21,801
Scott: but you multiply it by the number of workers in like you know the chinese factory and the increase right.

817
00:51:21,822 --> 00:51:23,549
Scott: that's going to be a huge subsidy.

818
00:51:23,589 --> 00:51:24,853
Rym: possibly pay a living wage?

819
00:51:24,954 --> 00:51:25,596
Rym: not really i'm not.

820
00:51:25,796 --> 00:51:27,080
Rym: you pay a living wage.

821
00:51:27,963 --> 00:51:33,182
Rym: so imagine this instead of the model of paying someone like us to do it you pay a living wage.

822
00:51:33,443 --> 00:51:36,577
Rym: not a great wage but enough wage for someone to take care of their family.

823
00:51:36,597 --> 00:51:40,172
Rym: it's not even that much money and you put it in some town where anyway.

824
00:51:40,773 --> 00:51:46,750
Rym: but by subsidizing it basically those people are learning at least a pretty good trade.

825
00:51:46,911 --> 00:51:48,137
Scott: you're also the other problems.

826
00:51:48,157 --> 00:51:50,329
Scott: there's all kinds of other issues that come into play there.

827
00:51:50,349 --> 00:51:50,791
Rym: oh yeah there's.

828
00:51:50,872 --> 00:51:52,380
Rym: there's international rules against.

829
00:51:52,421 --> 00:51:58,153
Scott: well it's like we have a lot more environmental regulations so that we couldn't even build the same kind of factory here and it would cost even more.

830
00:51:58,213 --> 00:52:02,492
Scott: yeah you know what it's not it's not like this factory's next door you know providing the other parts.

831
00:52:02,512 --> 00:52:04,139
Scott: we had to ship all these other parts.

832
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,766
Rym: yeah so we slowly build up.

833
00:52:05,807 --> 00:52:10,750
Rym: you build all the factories to build those pieces one by one subsidizing this huge ship fabrication industry.

834
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,880
Scott: yeah the only i mean i'm you know it's a good idea.

835
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:17,679
Scott: i'm just saying that on paper the number the amount of money it might take me so tremendous.

836
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:27,695
Rym: uh considering the scale of our current budgets in the us i don't think the scale is even close to what it would be compared to say i don't know the current oil subsidies.

837
00:52:27,735 --> 00:52:29,985
Scott: well i mean well you know it depends right i mean you know.

838
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:38,377
Scott: uh obama went to steve jobs and he was still alive supposedly and said hey how can we get those jobs you know back in the us?

839
00:52:38,417 --> 00:52:41,368
Scott: and steve jobs said those jobs aren't coming back right.

840
00:52:41,569 --> 00:52:43,898
Rym: yeah because jobs is this visionary on?

841
00:52:43,978 --> 00:52:45,424
Scott: no but i mean but he knows about.

842
00:52:45,484 --> 00:52:47,714
Scott: you know what cost to build things in factories?

843
00:52:47,774 --> 00:52:57,781
Rym: no i think he was being more pragmatic that the cost to build things in factories is the only factor anyone would look at and not any of these other you know possibly worthwhile results of investing this ridiculous sum of money.

844
00:52:57,982 --> 00:53:00,351
Scott: maybe it might it depending on the math.

845
00:53:00,451 --> 00:53:02,479
Scott: it may just be too ridiculous.

846
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:03,222
Rym: i don't think it is.

847
00:53:03,322 --> 00:53:15,172
Rym: and if it is then we're completely fucked as humans because it means that that all manufacturing will basically go to the shittiest place on earth and there will be a bunch of rich people of invested interest in keeping those places shitty forever.

848
00:53:16,294 --> 00:53:17,597
Scott: it just may be the case.

849
00:53:18,038 --> 00:53:19,421
Rym: i highly doubt that.

850
00:53:20,243 --> 00:53:24,554
Rym: or fine we make a military order of technologists.

851
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:26,200
Scott: i know that's real social.

852
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,405
Scott: that's in fact communism.

853
00:53:27,485 --> 00:53:28,429
Scott: you know what we're not.

854
00:53:28,509 --> 00:53:29,051
Scott: we're not going.

855
00:53:29,091 --> 00:53:29,493
Scott: that's god.

856
00:53:29,533 --> 00:53:37,427
Rym: if there was a knight's templar of technology that i could join and work in a monastery promoting well you go you can do that this freedom religion.

857
00:53:37,467 --> 00:53:39,075
Scott: i thought you were talking about a government order.

858
00:53:39,095 --> 00:53:41,748
Rym: oh yeah funded by the government like the old military orders.

859
00:53:41,788 --> 00:53:42,692
Scott: now you've got even three.

860
00:53:42,713 --> 00:53:43,817
Scott: you got even more problems.

861
00:53:43,857 --> 00:53:46,509
Rym: yeah knight's templar of knights technology are.

862
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:49,360
Scott: i think this show is going on too far is it maybe?

863
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:54,177
Scott: but yeah it is a concern that you know there could be back doors in ships.

864
00:53:54,358 --> 00:53:56,425
Scott: so it is something to you know.

865
00:53:56,445 --> 00:53:59,055
Scott: be concerned about when next time you're on new egg.

866
00:53:59,337 --> 00:53:59,799
Scott: just you know.

867
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:00,764
Scott: here's what you should do right.

868
00:54:00,784 --> 00:54:03,638
Scott: don't actually worry about this don't lose sleep over it don't do anything about it.

869
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:07,537
Scott: but next time you look at a motherboard on new egg or something like that zoom in.

870
00:54:07,939 --> 00:54:23,863
Scott: and or next time you buy a motherboard or look at the one inside your computer read who makes it says on every microchip that will be the name of the people who made it and the model numbers and all those things and you can go online and look up each of those chips and see where it came from and what it does by typing in the numbers right.

871
00:54:24,224 --> 00:54:26,152
Scott: so do that and take a look and see.

872
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:29,805
Scott: you know if you trust all of those or what you think about them.

873
00:54:30,588 --> 00:54:31,230
Scott: it's kind of interesting.

874
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:44,175
Scott: and if even if you're not worried about security you will learn something anyway about the various chips that are on various pieces of hardware even open up like a clock radio and search for all the chips and see what they are and it will be uh quite uh quite education.

875
00:54:47,739 --> 00:54:49,986
Rym: this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

876
00:54:50,027 --> 00:54:55,168
Rym: special thanks to dj pretzel for the opening music cat lee for web design and brand ok for the logos.

877
00:54:55,388 --> 00:55:00,448
Scott: be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes discussion news and more.

878
00:55:00,669 --> 00:55:08,138
Rym: remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech mondays gaming tuesdays anime comic wednesdays and indiscriminate thursdays.
