00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,687
Rym: It's Thursday, February 9th, 2011.

2
00:00:11,687 --> 00:00:12,349
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:13,291
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:14,835
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:17,020
Rym: Tonight, we talk about the Casa Play.

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,148
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,577
Rym: So lately in Midtown, there's been a ton of kind of like new lunch places that open.

8
00:00:32,597 --> 00:00:34,425
Rym: that are chains, but they're like a new chain.

9
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,553
Scott: So it's like they're trying to be the next Chipotle?

10
00:00:36,714 --> 00:00:38,300
Rym: Yeah, they're trying to be the next Chipotle.

11
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:43,760
Rym: It's very clear that they are and I've decided I like going to these places because they all kind of opened around the same time.

12
00:00:44,382 --> 00:00:46,047
Scott: I wish I had some of those places nearby.

13
00:00:46,268 --> 00:00:49,579
Rym: They're all not that great, but the thing is they all are like.

14
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:54,753
Rym: they have managers and like all the staff are like crazily well like trained and they're super.

15
00:00:55,154 --> 00:00:57,340
Rym: shall I warm sirs crack pipe.

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,969
Scott: Oh, it is excellente.

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,140
Rym: Like I went into this one today.

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,159
Rym: So my goal is to eat at all these places.

19
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,640
Rym: One of them is a coffee shop and actually they had pretty good coffee that cost the same as Starbucks.

20
00:01:07,581 --> 00:01:11,979
Rym: And it's on the way to Starbucks so I can shave like 30 seconds off in my day.

21
00:01:13,061 --> 00:01:14,066
Rym: But anyway, I went to this place.

22
00:01:14,086 --> 00:01:16,860
Rym: it was called like for food with a number in it or two food.

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,120
Rym: I don't even remember but it was way weird.

24
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,010
Rym: So I walk in and I can't.

25
00:01:22,091 --> 00:01:23,539
Rym: I look at the menu and I don't quite get it.

26
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,440
Rym: It shows like these donuts, but it's a burger joint.

27
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:31,120
Rym: But the menu is like what donut do you want and what do you want in the donut?

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,306
Rym: And what do you want with the donut?

29
00:01:32,608 --> 00:01:34,800
Rym: All right, and then this guy in a suit walks over.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,366
Scott: But I thought that you know, that's that's good.

31
00:01:36,386 --> 00:01:37,893
Scott: There's not a lot of donuts going on in the city.

32
00:01:37,913 --> 00:01:38,616
Rym: They're not donuts.

33
00:01:38,696 --> 00:01:39,198
Rym: They're beef.

34
00:01:40,823 --> 00:01:42,129
Rym: So, but so here's the thing.

35
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:43,796
Rym: this guy walks over very well-dressed.

36
00:01:43,836 --> 00:01:46,909
Rym: he's like, "Sir, have you been to our fine establishment

37
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:47,231
Rym: before?".

38
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:48,598
Rym: And I'm like, "Nah, I've never been

39
00:01:48,638 --> 00:01:48,718
Rym: here.".

40
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,857
Rym: He's like, "I shall explain to you the many mysteries of our

41
00:01:51,917 --> 00:01:52,300
Rym: restaurant.".

42
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:54,620
Scott: Why it looks like a donut, but is it?

43
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,280
Rym: And he proceeds to walk me through the menu.

44
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,299
Rym: He's like, "Basically, you build your own lunch.

45
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,820
Rym: But the deal is our donut, our burgers are shaped like donuts and the burgers aren't just beef.

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,220
Rym: They can also be chicken or hummus or whatever.

47
00:02:04,483 --> 00:02:12,120
Rym: It was like ten kinds and basically you go down the line and you pick an item from every column and it when it comes out at the end is a lunch.

48
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,360
Rym: And like if you get a burger, it's like this donut shaped burger.

49
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,519
Scott: So something goes in the middle?

50
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,081
Rym: Yeah, you.

51
00:02:18,102 --> 00:02:18,985
Rym: so I got one.

52
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:22,460
Rym: and the thing is if you can't if you're uncreative and you can't like figure it out.

53
00:02:22,903 --> 00:02:25,160
Rym: you can get their pre-made ones, but they all have names.

54
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,299
Rym: One of them was "They's a-rapin' everybody" and it's it's a picture of that guy.

55
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:30,482
Scott: What?

56
00:02:30,603 --> 00:02:30,945
Scott: Really?

57
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:33,060
Scott: It's called "They's a-rapin' everybody"?

58
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:39,975
Rym: It doesn't spell out a rape, but it is a. Okay in a restaurant, yeah the place and get this.

59
00:02:40,095 --> 00:02:41,180
Rym: all the seats had iPads.

60
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,680
Rym: You can just like go on the internet with the iPad while you're eating.

61
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,500
Scott: Hide your kids, hide your wife, don't go to that restaurant.

62
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,251
Scott: And it was like 10 bucks.

63
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:48,076
Rym: Like it was pretty good.

64
00:02:48,096 --> 00:02:48,700
Rym: The food was okay.

65
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:49,888
Rym: But the deal was.

66
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:56,540
Rym: I got this like beef burger donut on a brioche and inside of it was a cheese stick like melted into the middle.

67
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,464
Rym: There's some jalapenos in it and and I got some fried potatoes and I I don't know.

68
00:03:02,484 --> 00:03:03,370
Rym: It was pretty good though.

69
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,778
Rym: They clearly microwave everything behind the scenes.

70
00:03:07,602 --> 00:03:07,663
Scott: Mmm.

71
00:03:07,683 --> 00:03:08,479
Scott: Oh, you don't get to see?

72
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,338
Rym: Nah, you don't get to see.

73
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:11,964
Rym: But I don't know.

74
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:20,878
Rym: it was kind of weird and I'm not sure if I like the place but the fact that they had a picture of "They's a-rapin' everybody" and named one of their burgers after.

75
00:03:20,898 --> 00:03:21,320
Rym: that was.

76
00:03:22,424 --> 00:03:24,060
Rym: It was most memorable.

77
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,200
Scott: I would just go to the place that's been there for a while.

78
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,840
Scott: That's meat on steak in a box with a miso soup and a rice.

79
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:32,160
Rym: Thing is if I want stuff like that, I'll go one step further.

80
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,773
Rym: I go to the Omsipie right by me and you can.

81
00:03:33,793 --> 00:03:38,091
Rym: they have like the fanciest rice balls and you buy like four rice balls and that's your dinner.

82
00:03:38,874 --> 00:03:39,054
Rym: Mmm.

83
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:40,439
Rym: They're way big.

84
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,224
Rym: Mmm.

85
00:03:41,386 --> 00:03:42,138
Rym: They're way good.

86
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:42,960
Rym: Mmm.

87
00:03:43,342 --> 00:03:46,719
Rym: Or wait till you know if it's warm and I'll go over to Le Pen CÃ´tillon again.

88
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,362
Rym: Uh-huh.

89
00:03:47,463 --> 00:03:48,570
Rym: I'm not walking over there now.

90
00:03:48,932 --> 00:03:50,000
Rym: It is a bit cold.

91
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,687
Scott: There's one.

92
00:03:50,748 --> 00:03:53,608
Scott: it's oh my god It's so warm and like freaking.

93
00:03:53,809 --> 00:04:02,480
Scott: last yesterday when I morning was so warm I was like, oh Or when we did the show and I was like you came over and you're like it is fucking cold out there.

94
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,720
Rym: And I'm like, what are you talking about?

95
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,168
Scott: And I was like the friggin.

96
00:04:05,188 --> 00:04:07,220
Scott: I was like the groundhog said early spring.

97
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:09,590
Scott: So I'm like maybe right because they don't the grant.

98
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,253
Scott: these is they?

99
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:11,920
Scott: the groundhog doesn't see anything.

100
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,986
Rym: They park the day on Groundhog Day.

101
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:18,519
Rym: The first post was a photoshop of the groundhog dead covered in ice and everyone crying.

102
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,063
Scott: Yeah Pretty much.

103
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:26,203
Scott: the weathermen know if it's gonna be an early spring or not and then they tell the groundhog people whether it's yet It is or not.

104
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:31,900
Rym: I read somewhere that they're pretty much like not statistically significantly over random.

105
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:32,623
Rym: So I don't.

106
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:35,014
Scott: I thought I thought that they were just more recently.

107
00:04:35,034 --> 00:04:36,460
Scott: They've been listening to whatever the weatherman.

108
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:36,944
Scott: I don't know.

109
00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:37,226
Rym: I don't.

110
00:04:37,428 --> 00:04:38,800
Rym: I don't know if they actually do that or not.

111
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,724
Rym: Well, who knows?

112
00:04:39,764 --> 00:04:41,231
Scott: who knows when they started doing it.

113
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:43,080
Scott: We should look like one year at a time.

114
00:04:43,281 --> 00:04:44,849
Rym: So if I were them, you know what I would do.

115
00:04:44,929 --> 00:04:47,000
Rym: I would actually just do the groundhog thing.

116
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,162
Rym: Whatever to.

117
00:04:48,182 --> 00:04:50,130
Rym: however the groundhog reacts is how I would do it.

118
00:04:50,692 --> 00:04:51,174
Rym: Mm-hmm.

119
00:04:51,696 --> 00:04:52,499
Scott: But how can you tell?

120
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:53,963
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

121
00:04:53,983 --> 00:04:57,479
Rym: you set up a webcam and you put him in his hole and you just wait.

122
00:04:57,499 --> 00:05:01,632
Scott: and How do you know if the groundhog sees a shadow or not?

123
00:05:01,832 --> 00:05:03,940
Scott: You it's not like the groundhog says to you.

124
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:04,971
Scott: Oh, man, I see it.

125
00:05:05,012 --> 00:05:05,356
Scott: There it is.

126
00:05:05,396 --> 00:05:05,640
Scott: There it is.

127
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,022
Scott: It is.

128
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:10,080
Rym: you gotta come up with some sort of metric like once he comes out cuz the thing is he sees a shadow when?

129
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:10,919
Rym: He runs away.

130
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:17,760
Rym: So the first time he pokes his head out Does he get all the way out of the hole and walk off or does he go right the fuck back in that hole?

131
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:19,609
Rym: That's what you do.

132
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:25,940
Scott: Maybe make some sort of robotic groundhog thing is I imagine it would be pretty rare that he goes right back in that hole.

133
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,365
Scott: and Also, what's to guarantee?

134
00:05:27,385 --> 00:05:28,349
Scott: He's gonna come out of the hole.

135
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,400
Rym: Yeah, you might be frozen to death in there, right?

136
00:05:34,223 --> 00:05:35,732
Scott: Where does the groundhog even live don't they?

137
00:05:35,812 --> 00:05:37,160
Scott: isn't it like it in a zoo or something?

138
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:37,803
Rym: but you were like.

139
00:05:37,824 --> 00:05:41,345
Scott: and then they just and then just carry it out to like the Town square.

140
00:05:41,385 --> 00:05:41,969
Rym: it's like a pet.

141
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,586
Rym: I don't know but you were like, it's cold I'm like bullshit.

142
00:05:44,888 --> 00:05:48,425
Rym: and then I open the window after you left and Literally well one.

143
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:48,726
Rym: I try.

144
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:49,490
Rym: I heard this noise.

145
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:50,314
Rym: I couldn't figure out what it was.

146
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:51,721
Rym: then go to the window and I don't see Anything.

147
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:54,892
Rym: I try to open the window and I can't like it won't open.

148
00:05:55,013 --> 00:05:56,097
Rym: It's frozen shut.

149
00:05:56,197 --> 00:05:57,060
Rym: No, it's not frozen shot.

150
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,814
Rym: So I go to the balcony and I open that and the wind almost knocks me over.

151
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:04,110
Rym: The wind was so strong I was crazy in my windows.

152
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,758
Rym: Yeah, and it was so cold

153
00:06:06,301 --> 00:06:11,640
Scott: I was so I was like almost feeling like maybe biking will come soon, but then no punishment for even thinking that

154
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,585
Rym: Just because

155
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:24,274
Scott: I thought about bicycles it just punished me and was like, oh I hear Scott's thinking about bicycles - 50 degrees Friggin Tetris God and weather God hitting it up playing ping-pong.

156
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:25,820
Rym: I mean, I like skiing.

157
00:06:26,881 --> 00:06:34,384
Rym: Skiing is one of my favorite ice peace ice peace Tetris God sketch.

158
00:06:34,444 --> 00:06:35,608
Rym: just for some reason not.

159
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,297
Rym: that's like one of my favorites of all time from them.

160
00:06:38,438 --> 00:06:38,899
Scott: It's a good one.

161
00:06:39,522 --> 00:06:42,833
Rym: But yeah, also, you know tomorrow well tonight I'm going to the symphony.

162
00:06:42,874 --> 00:06:44,680
Rym: that's what we're actually recording the show a night early.

163
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:56,419
Rym: I'll let the bag out of the can But I got a phone call from the Philharmonic today interesting and they were like it was a recording but it was like.

164
00:06:56,965 --> 00:07:12,300
Rym: Dear sir We would like to inform you in case you were unaware that there will be no late seating for the Shostakovich and Beethoven Show on Thursday, so if you show up after the appointed time, you will not be allowed in with no refund.

165
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,260
Rym: No, it says you will not be granted entry nor will you receive a refund?

166
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:16,902
Rym: That's right.

167
00:07:16,922 --> 00:07:23,708
Rym: We humbly suggest that you arrive a full half hour before the event Thank you and have a wonderful performance.

168
00:07:23,989 --> 00:07:27,500
Scott: It's just they got an automatic auto dialer and you bought tickets here in the system.

169
00:07:27,844 --> 00:07:28,229
Rym: I don't know.

170
00:07:28,351 --> 00:07:40,370
Rym: I'm I'm digging this because I've been to symphonies in a lot of places But I feel like Lincoln Center is the one place where a hundred percent of the old etiquette about Concerts that people don't seem to goddamn know anymore.

171
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,594
Rym: It's still in effect.

172
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,120
Rym: I feel like I have an intermission.

173
00:07:43,261 --> 00:07:46,679
Rym: They have you know, I feel like nobody's gonna clap at the wrong time.

174
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:51,800
Rym: No, not pretty much not and I feel like everyone else there is gonna be wearing a suit just like me.

175
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:53,189
Scott: Yeah, probably better be.

176
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,793
Scott: I've been there.

177
00:07:53,813 --> 00:07:54,780
Scott: Yeah, that's how they do.

178
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:06,411
Rym: I was very disappointed when I paid hundreds of dollars a seat to go see a play not that long ago And it was you know, it was a really good play with big-name people in it and half The audience was basically wearing jeans the t-shirt.

179
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:06,773
Rym: Yeah.

180
00:08:06,793 --> 00:08:08,320
Scott: Well, you know, there's no dress code on Broadway.

181
00:08:08,682 --> 00:08:12,478
Rym: Yeah, but in this kind of show, I feel like I should have people should have dressed up.

182
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:14,612
Rym: Yeah, I was disappointed.

183
00:08:14,673 --> 00:08:15,659
Rym: I'm disappointed son.

184
00:08:16,604 --> 00:08:19,044
Scott: Anyway, anyway It's really cool.

185
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:19,707
Rym: Yeah, it is.

00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,073
Rym: So it's Thursday.

Scott: I got a promotion from sheriff to federal marshal.

194
00:08:38,054 --> 00:08:40,179
Scott: We're talking to Scott Earp.

195
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:47,185
Rym: This isn't good because if you talk to us at any point prior to Tuesday of this week.

196
00:08:47,707 --> 00:08:48,870
Rym: I was the outlaw god.

197
00:08:49,211 --> 00:08:51,017
Rym: Nobody could fucking beat me Scott Lee.

198
00:08:51,238 --> 00:08:51,880
Rym: Nobody could beat me.

199
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,320
Rym: I was just like hands down invincible.

200
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,261
Scott: It's not too looking so good for me at the moment really and I just gonna lie and say you won like you do a T&E.

201
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:04,880
Scott: just you beat the everliving shit out of it, right two days in a row again, you know what rims new title is.

202
00:09:05,781 --> 00:09:06,646
Rym: What's my title?

203
00:09:06,948 --> 00:09:08,356
Scott: Swiss to Coster Swiss?

204
00:09:11,187 --> 00:09:14,050
Scott: So many holes through you Swiss.

205
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:20,052
Rym: Okay I realized when I said it you automatically said cheese.

206
00:09:20,574 --> 00:09:21,377
Scott: I wanted to say cheese.

207
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:21,898
Rym: Did you?

208
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:24,390
Rym: Yes Are you sure that it wasn't some sort of neurolinguistic?

209
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,420
Scott: Well, no cuz I wanted people to get the joke.

210
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,704
Scott: They'd be like Swiss Rym.

211
00:09:27,744 --> 00:09:29,671
Scott: What does that have to do with winning an outlaw?

212
00:09:29,912 --> 00:09:32,080
Rym: since when do we expect people to get the joke?

213
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,500
Scott: It's because if he's Swiss cheese, I shot him full of holes.

214
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:35,667
Rym: So is that your news?

215
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,560
Rym: you want to talk about our outlaw exploits?

216
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,979
Rym: I could talk about some news also because I mean we could play some combat or some maze craze or some spider-man.

217
00:09:43,503 --> 00:09:54,249
Scott: So anyway Sexism and anti-womanism in the video game world, especially the public online Multiplayer gaming world is not news.

218
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,680
Rym: Don't forget racism a lot of racism.

219
00:09:57,101 --> 00:10:00,090
Scott: Yeah racism, of course, right but sexism also right.

220
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,895
Scott: just as much not news.

221
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:03,700
Scott: It's been around it's gonna be around.

222
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:04,690
Scott: It ain't going nowhere.

223
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:13,521
Scott: All right, however You know and plenty of feminist gaming blogging people have written about it in the past many times most recently Dick Wolf scenario Etc.

224
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:13,822
Scott: Etc.

225
00:10:13,842 --> 00:10:14,244
Scott: Etc.

226
00:10:14,384 --> 00:10:14,525
Rym: Yep.

227
00:10:14,545 --> 00:10:17,214
Rym: I mean we all know it's a problem and it I don't.

228
00:10:17,334 --> 00:10:19,983
Rym: we don't have any good ways to deal with It in the short term.

229
00:10:20,084 --> 00:10:22,672
Scott: However, so this I found a new thing.

230
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,559
Scott: It's pretty new that is taken.

231
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,429
Scott: I think what is the best approach to this ever right?

232
00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:30,319
Scott: and is a blog called fat ugly or slutty calm?

233
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:33,619
Rym: and On this blog don't Google for that by the way.

234
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:36,720
Scott: Yeah, go directly to fat ugly or slutty calm.

235
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:45,807
Scott: They post not dot org screen captures and videos and audio captures but mostly just screenshots of Sexism in multiplayer online video games.

236
00:10:45,847 --> 00:10:50,618
Scott: So most of them are like pictures of Xbox Live messages and it's like, you know stuff.

237
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:55,739
Scott: for example Hey if I bet you can I see you with a thong?

238
00:10:57,503 --> 00:10:59,002
Rym: Here's one Really?

239
00:10:59,163 --> 00:11:04,056
Scott: I'm going to travel back in time dot dot find a dinosaur egg dot dot.

240
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:13,403
Scott: bring it back to the future Sit on it till it hatches raise it love it and then watch it mangle your lifeless and helpless carcass while I touch myself Inappropriately.

241
00:11:13,503 --> 00:11:15,149
Rym: that wasn't really sexist.

242
00:11:15,851 --> 00:11:18,380
Rym: Yeah, but you know, basically that was actually pretty good.

243
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,297
Rym: These are things that you know, that was that was above the line.

244
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:22,820
Rym: I don't know what to call.

245
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:32,940
Scott: These are things that girls have received as messages while playing games online Messages like that and they don't like them and they post them in this blog and some of them are just you know examples.

246
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:39,076
Scott: but This one so is I think the most quality right?

247
00:11:39,758 --> 00:11:40,240
Rym: Oh, wait, wait.

248
00:11:40,341 --> 00:11:41,880
Rym: So your news is hey.

249
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,868
Rym: So there's this blog of the horrible sexist things.

250
00:11:43,888 --> 00:11:46,698
Rym: people say pause and here's the best.

251
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:50,894
Scott: goddamn All right, cuz most of them are just like ah, oh, that's terrible.

252
00:11:51,135 --> 00:11:52,560
Scott: What is up with that disgusting person?

253
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,959
Scott: But this one it's like, okay, even the comments on the blog are like, okay This guy gets points for being at least funny, right?

254
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:08,407
Scott: Basically this guy is his avatar is the picture of the godfather and his username is pick a boss and he says Keep camping woman.

255
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:10,159
Scott: I hope there's a kitchen in that tent.

256
00:12:13,101 --> 00:12:16,395
Scott: And one of the comments is even like man I want a tent with a kitchen in it.

257
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,345
Scott: that's some high-tech shit And I was like hell.

258
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,153
Scott: I want to get a tent with a kitchen in it.

259
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,660
Scott: That is some high-tech shit.

260
00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:34,413
Rym: It does sad me though I mean I've been playing a lot of counter-strike lately and I I can literally tell you exactly how many women I have played Counter-strike with in the last I don't know six months.

261
00:12:34,714 --> 00:12:45,000
Scott: The answer is one Literally one and you know It's not the only reason but a big part of the reason is because of the things like you see on this here blog.

262
00:12:45,321 --> 00:12:56,380
Rym: What I what I really don't get and I want a term for it because there's like this sliding line of intelligence But there's sort of a black hole like a line below which I do not consider something that someone said online

263
00:12:57,082 --> 00:12:57,664
Scott: To be

264
00:12:57,684 --> 00:13:00,893
Rym: in any way actually a comment like.

265
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:08,956
Rym: it's not any more communication of any kind But some other thing kind of like how when I take a dump, I don't consider that communication.

266
00:13:09,017 --> 00:13:10,140
Rym: I consider it taking a dump.

267
00:13:10,401 --> 00:13:11,043
Scott: Yeah, it's it's.

268
00:13:11,103 --> 00:13:13,511
Scott: it's weird that like, you know, I mean verbal dump.

269
00:13:13,551 --> 00:13:16,040
Rym: people post like I'm are you cocker?

270
00:13:17,843 --> 00:13:27,223
Scott: Right, it's like if I'm playing a game and someone's like fuck you Jew faggot rotten hell Negroes Fuck shit Strong.

271
00:13:27,243 --> 00:13:30,073
Rym: a bunch of words together and not your nouns and verbs like I don't.

272
00:13:30,153 --> 00:13:36,400
Scott: I don't even read it or process it Right, but it you know, these things apparently are upsetting many female gamers.

273
00:13:37,681 --> 00:13:44,820
Rym: Someone is like fuck you racist slur something at least they formed what is almost a coherent sentence.

274
00:13:45,663 --> 00:13:47,570
Rym: I feel like most of these and looking through that blog.

275
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,915
Rym: It sounds like it's the case there too.

276
00:13:49,377 --> 00:13:50,100
Rym: They're below that.

277
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:56,680
Rym: They don't even make sense in and of themselves like the words together in no order or combination.

278
00:13:57,185 --> 00:13:58,779
Rym: Actually conveys any message.

279
00:13:59,722 --> 00:14:07,659
Rym: Yeah, some of them but a lot of them are just like, you know I mean my evidence of this is look at the comments on YouTube like who who's posting that?

280
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,704
Rym: Who's saying these things?

281
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:12,115
Rym: Like I want to see the kid who is sitting there.

282
00:14:12,136 --> 00:14:15,999
Rym: He's 12, dude But I can't believe all 12 year olds are that way.

283
00:14:17,543 --> 00:14:18,394
Rym: How many is it?

284
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,267
Rym: Yeah, anyway, I have some much more.

285
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:22,532
Scott: So wait, there's one more.

286
00:14:23,194 --> 00:14:24,881
Scott: This is an example of a bad one Right.

287
00:14:24,901 --> 00:14:32,220
Scott: So king of lols whose avatar is mice Hughes is is clearly not okay says, how are you playing banette Bayonetta?

288
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,739
Scott: There's no console in the kitchen.

289
00:14:34,382 --> 00:14:37,032
Scott: And then he says I can tell if a game is good just by looking at the cover.

290
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:38,960
Scott: and it's unrealistic because how did the angels?

291
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,959
Scott: Get in Bayonetta's kitchen in the first place?

292
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,833
Scott: Okay, yeah, see that's the kind of you know bad ones that are most of this site.

293
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:49,160
Rym: at least it was still a complete sentence.

294
00:14:49,261 --> 00:14:49,947
Rym: I'll give it that.

295
00:14:50,512 --> 00:14:51,259
Rym: yeah kind of.

296
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,393
Rym: So this will outrage you on a much more profound.

297
00:14:56,433 --> 00:14:57,115
Rym: love a new list.

298
00:14:57,135 --> 00:14:57,877
Scott: Love the outrage.

299
00:14:58,078 --> 00:14:58,700
Rym: I love the outrage.

300
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,748
Scott: You should make an outrage podcast.

301
00:15:00,828 --> 00:15:01,751
Scott: It's like outrage.

302
00:15:01,932 --> 00:15:03,960
Rym: You know, what grinds my gears.

303
00:15:05,562 --> 00:15:07,797
Rym: So this is a story from North America.

304
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:20,860
Rym: It's from North Carolina, in fact North Raleigh And a citizen of the United States has been accused and there it looks like there will be a court case about that.

305
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,279
Rym: There's an investigation a very suspect.

306
00:15:24,182 --> 00:15:27,592
Rym: He's been accused of practicing engineering without a license.

307
00:15:28,354 --> 00:15:29,658
Scott: Do you need a license to engineer?

308
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,446
Rym: So Thus the problem.

309
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:34,254
Rym: basically what happened here?

310
00:15:34,314 --> 00:15:35,600
Scott: I mean in a license to doctor?

311
00:15:36,222 --> 00:15:40,659
Scott: Yeah, and you need a license to be an auctioneer however and your license to drive a car?

312
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:42,585
Rym: I believe a lot of those.

313
00:15:43,107 --> 00:15:46,637
Rym: they're all different situations, but consider the case of a doctor, right?

314
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:50,228
Rym: I cannot Pretend to be a doctor unless I'm actually a doctor.

315
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:53,600
Rym: I cannot go operate on someone unless I am a doctor, right?

316
00:15:53,900 --> 00:16:03,931
Rym: Yeah, but what if I state an opinion that is related in some way to medicine just out in the open Like on my blog or something that's called freedom of speech.

317
00:16:04,353 --> 00:16:05,920
Scott: You just can't say that you're a doctor.

318
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:11,340
Scott: You can't present it as medical advice just like you can't say this is legal advice.

319
00:16:11,461 --> 00:16:13,620
Rym: So you're expecting where the stories are gonna go.

320
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,639
Rym: So here here's I'm gonna head you off.

321
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:17,786
Rym: The deal was a city.

322
00:16:17,946 --> 00:16:21,957
Rym: North Raleigh was like we don't think we need to put a traffic light somewhere.

323
00:16:22,017 --> 00:16:32,860
Rym: like they decided they didn't Need signals at these two intersections and they hired an engineering firm which said you know gave their opinion that they weren't needed and The people in town basically said this is kind of bullshit.

324
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,703
Rym: We don't agree with you.

325
00:16:34,245 --> 00:16:43,460
Rym: one of the guys in town who felt strongly about it who is not an engineer or anything Put together in a short simple eight-page document where he just stated his opinion.

326
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:55,253
Rym: He showed map here quote eight-page document with maps diagrams and traffic projection Objections and he offered this to the city saying look I think we should have one regardless what that engineering firm says.

327
00:16:55,313 --> 00:16:55,975
Rym: Here's my opinion.

328
00:16:55,995 --> 00:16:59,566
Rym: Mm-hmm And the city said we disagree with you.

329
00:17:00,328 --> 00:17:13,477
Rym: and to quote the article Lacey who is the chief traffic engineer for the state Department of Transportation Called the state licensing agency the new North Carolina Board of Examiners for engineers and surveyors to investigate him.

330
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:24,219
Rym: because quote He filed the complaint because the report appeared to be engineering level work By someone who is not licensed as a professional engineer.

331
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:25,366
Scott: At

332
00:17:25,406 --> 00:17:46,357
Rym: no point that this person claimed to be an engineer Claimed to be claimed to any of these things work as an engineer except money for all he did was state his opinion publicly and mail it to the city and the city's accusing him of Practicing engineering without a license not because he practiced engineering but because the opinion he gave quote appeared to be Well done.

333
00:17:47,882 --> 00:17:50,196
Scott: Well, you know if the court doesn't throw this out.

334
00:17:50,498 --> 00:18:01,880
Scott: It's This sounds to me like who knows what the law for engineering license is looking out of that This is someone who claimed to be a lawyer actually said I'll paraphrase here claiming to be a lawyer.

335
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,642
Scott: That's dangerous that

336
00:18:02,722 --> 00:18:19,720
Rym: if you strictly read the law that the and those statutes and all the things that they're referring to which I couldn't Actually find online it basically forbids Anyone from observing any professional performing any service needed for the planning or completion of virtually any civic project for any?

337
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,300
Rym: Evaluatory purposes whatsoever, even if it is only for a personal opinion.

338
00:18:24,142 --> 00:18:30,520
Rym: It also particularly cites if you use math or if you compare the work to drawings or plans.

339
00:18:30,862 --> 00:18:32,372
Scott: Well, that's clearly unconstitutional.

340
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:33,580
Scott: First Amendment situation.

341
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:35,208
Rym: Here's where this really bad.

342
00:18:35,228 --> 00:18:36,153
Scott: It's like cut and dry.

343
00:18:36,173 --> 00:18:37,459
Rym: I feel like this is a problem.

344
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:47,552
Scott: You know I think it's pretty obvious that both that law and this person using that law are both Were created and do exist for the purposes of covering up corruption.

345
00:18:47,933 --> 00:18:56,500
Scott: the town didn't want to spend money on traffic lights So instead they spent a little bit less money to get some engineers to put a rubber stamp on that.

346
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,779
Scott: You don't need traffic lights.

347
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,305
Scott: so people call so that they would could save money.

348
00:19:00,385 --> 00:19:08,860
Rym: and it was just called this guy out on his bullshit and I have a quote from him when he was basically presented with the fact that this is a quote from the State Department of Transportation.

349
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:19,293
Rym: Who's the bullshitter when you start applying the principles for trip generation and a route assignment Applying judgments from engineering documents and national standards and making recommendations.

350
00:19:19,653 --> 00:19:21,859
Rym: That's technical work that a licensed engineer would do.

351
00:19:22,814 --> 00:19:24,763
Rym: Yeah Yeah That's his rationale.

352
00:19:24,783 --> 00:19:35,735
Rym: that because the guy was competent and intelligent and had basic reasoning skills That he does no longer have the right to freedom of speech I think this guy should run is an elected position to be head of the.

353
00:19:35,755 --> 00:19:36,980
Rym: I have no ID.

354
00:19:37,421 --> 00:19:41,796
Scott: Run for that position or further because you should vote for someone who will appoint him to that.

355
00:19:41,816 --> 00:19:47,458
Rym: because we have a problem in the US where we have free speech, but we restrict commercial speech and I agree with both of those.

356
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:52,980
Rym: 100% Yeah, but we have a situation where there are a lot of this political speech.

357
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:57,160
Rym: It's the first speech that there are things that are free speech that are regulated nonetheless.

358
00:19:57,242 --> 00:20:09,508
Rym: for example it is very tricky as to whether like to what degree me saying my opinion on a law becomes giving legal advice and The Actual laws about that as I was trying to.

359
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:14,966
Scott: it's only advice if you specifically say you should do this And you just say I believe this and the.

360
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:15,728
Scott: this is the same.

361
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:25,006
Rym: So here's the problem, but by that logic almost every senior IT engineer in the in America is breaking that on a regular basis.

362
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:35,994
Rym: because one of the primary things that these people will do and none of them are lawyers is Give internal advice as to open source licensing Mm-hmm, and a lot of things are technically illegal under those sorts of regulations.

363
00:20:36,155 --> 00:20:39,508
Rym: and at least in this case I can say that I am an engineer.

364
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,300
Rym: I've worked as an engineer for many many years.

365
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,656
Scott: My title is currently needed a license to be an engineer in New York.

366
00:20:45,957 --> 00:20:46,460
Rym: I don't think so.

367
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:48,230
Rym: But then again, maybe I could be wrong.

368
00:20:48,371 --> 00:20:49,939
Rym: Maybe you need one to be a civil engineer.

369
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:52,687
Scott: Maybe I don't know I mean to be a civil engineer.

370
00:20:52,707 --> 00:20:55,260
Scott: that actually would do something like actually survey a bridge.

371
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:56,928
Scott: Sure, that's okay.

372
00:20:56,948 --> 00:21:04,720
Scott: If you need a license to do that Yeah, but at the same time at the same time some guy just doing the actual surveying work for the bridge.

373
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:11,480
Rym: She was just yes, but Scott what if I am NOT an engineer or surveyor, but it's my hobby.

374
00:21:11,822 --> 00:21:20,264
Rym: So I go out to the bridge I get the permission to do it You know pry pods and whatever and I survey the bridge on my own for fun and I put it on my blog That's fine.

375
00:21:20,324 --> 00:21:24,197
Scott: As long as we're not making the bridge or making adjustments to the bridge based on you.

376
00:21:24,358 --> 00:21:25,020
Rym: All right, so what?

377
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:35,591
Rym: Problem According to some of these laws It looks like you could get in trouble if someone else unbeknownst to you use the information you publicly made available To then make a decision.

378
00:21:35,611 --> 00:21:36,800
Scott: Well that laws bullshit.

379
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,777
Scott: They should get in trouble for using your information because that's would be copyright infringer.

380
00:21:40,797 --> 00:21:41,238
Scott: Would it not?

381
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:50,040
Rym: Ah, perhaps but may but it using someone's information is not copyright infringement It's only if you redistribute it in its original form or in a replacement form.

382
00:21:50,341 --> 00:21:58,053
Scott: If you if I do a big report and that report is you know made available under a not, you know Depending on what license I make that available under.

383
00:21:58,073 --> 00:21:58,797
Scott: Oh, I guess.

384
00:21:58,878 --> 00:22:01,352
Scott: no Mmm, I don't know.

385
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:02,639
Scott: That's that's tough.

386
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:10,146
Scott: Like if I if I architect a bridge and then you just I put my plans online You know, but it no.

387
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:20,420
Scott: if you make the bridge that I made plans for and I put the plans online You're it would clearly be copyright infringement If you took my all rights reserved blueprints and copied them and gave them to everybody.

388
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:21,168
Rym: Oh, there's a minor.

389
00:22:21,188 --> 00:22:25,210
Scott: if you make the bridge It's like if I make some sheet music and I put it online.

390
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,060
Scott: right you you pass the sheet music around.

391
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:29,020
Scott: That's copyright infringement.

392
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,087
Scott: But what if you play the song?

393
00:22:31,127 --> 00:22:34,600
Scott: do I have any claim to that if you make a YouTube of you playing the song?

394
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,177
Scott: That does not include the sheet music.

395
00:22:37,721 --> 00:22:40,473
Rym: There's a whole body of law that I'm not familiar enough.

396
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:41,176
Rym: Well, you know what.

397
00:22:41,196 --> 00:22:42,200
Scott: so that would be the same thing.

398
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,705
Scott: You know what?

399
00:22:42,725 --> 00:22:46,020
Rym: I Cannot legally give my opinion.

400
00:22:46,381 --> 00:22:47,270
Scott: I'm just saying this would be.

401
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,279
Scott: that would be the same.

402
00:22:48,682 --> 00:22:53,920
Scott: It's the same situation legally as far as I see If I make blueprints and you build the bridge.

403
00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:00,620
Rym: That's not me saying so you can't publicly perform for example a cover of something unless you have the ASCAP licenses.

404
00:23:01,201 --> 00:23:03,147
Rym: Mmm, but there's a little update here.

405
00:23:03,247 --> 00:23:10,731
Rym: Andrew Ritter the executive director of the engineering licensing board in the state Said that it'll take three or four months to investigate this.

406
00:23:11,072 --> 00:23:12,258
Rym: but some follow-up here.

407
00:23:12,318 --> 00:23:24,778
Rym: It looks like The they admitted that they receive things like this all the time that the Department of Transportation Constantly receives this sort of thing from citizens who are pissed off about one or other decision they made.

408
00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:35,400
Rym: Mm-hmm This is the first time they've ever taken action against someone because the level the quality of the work was too high And that it appeared to be an unlicensed engineer as opposed to simply a concerned citizen.

409
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:36,546
Rym: Uh-huh.

410
00:23:36,868 --> 00:23:40,993
Rym: It's almost like they want to criminalize Smart yeah, yeah.

411
00:23:41,134 --> 00:23:46,740
Rym: Yeah, but They should bust the people who Sort of agrees with this quote.

412
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:52,780
Rym: He said there's a potential for violation of the Department of Transportation and the public were misled by quote.

413
00:23:53,221 --> 00:23:58,799
Rym: Engineering quality work unquote even if the authors did not actually claim to be engineers.

414
00:23:59,802 --> 00:24:02,168
Rym: All right, I'm done with my outrage.

415
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:03,130
Rym: that's just yeah.

416
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:09,300
Rym: I point this out because things like this happen pretty regularly And this is just one specific example.

417
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:17,320
Rym: I happen to pick up from FARC and it does not get a lot of press and I don't know if I'll bother following up On it four months from now when I've forgotten and I have some new outrage.

418
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:23,399
Rym: But you should be outraged and whenever if anything like this ever happens to you fight the goddamn fight to the end.

419
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,764
Scott: Anti-intellectualism number one enemy.

420
00:24:32,318 --> 00:24:37,131
Scott: So with things over the day Man, so this thing of the day was all over the internet.

421
00:24:37,271 --> 00:24:38,638
Scott: So whatever I'm gonna show it to you.

422
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:44,860
Scott: Anyway Some dude he told the story of Star Wars for you know, only he told it in icons.

423
00:24:45,221 --> 00:24:47,547
Rym: So it's all icons like nothing.

424
00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:49,011
Scott: but yeah, so it's there.

425
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:52,020
Scott: It's well, it's it's a retold in icono scope.

426
00:24:53,121 --> 00:25:03,026
Scott: So it's 32 lines long and each line is he's just little graphics with little pictures of droids and floppy disks and Luke's and lightsabers.

427
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:12,400
Rym: Oh, you realize you realize that four thousand years from now Archaeologists are trying to piece pierce back to what happened during our century based on those hieroglyphics.

428
00:25:13,301 --> 00:25:23,780
Scott: Quite possible, but they would not be they might not last because they're in JPEG for So they may not survive and they also, you know may not have the JPEG cipher.

429
00:25:25,383 --> 00:25:27,279
Scott: They'll need the JPEG Rosetta Stone first.

430
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:38,992
Rym: so There's a reason that we can't have nice things in America and partly it's that Because anyone who's smart gets in trouble for being a fake engineer.

431
00:25:39,133 --> 00:25:43,508
Rym: also because if anything is in a public space It eventually gets peed on and written on.

432
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:45,154
Rym: that's true without exception.

433
00:25:45,194 --> 00:25:49,431
Rym: if it's in a public place long enough Don't forget pooped on the number and it is a function.

434
00:25:49,471 --> 00:26:02,140
Rym: not just that it's it's how long something has been there And it's also a function of the number of human beings who encounter it on a daily basis on average Yep, and the higher those are you're guaranteed to have poop urine and graffiti.

435
00:26:02,821 --> 00:26:09,402
Rym: Yes, no matter what this is why we can't have capsule hotels because they would become hobo hotels, yep followed by poop hotels Yep.

436
00:26:10,084 --> 00:26:11,791
Scott: Well the other the other thing is that right?

437
00:26:11,851 --> 00:26:14,320
Scott: So in other countries, why don't they have hobo hotels?

438
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,322
Scott: because if a hobo shows up they say get the fuck out of here hobo and they Are.

439
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:24,139
Rym: or some countries have social safety nets that make sure the people who have mental problems that lead them living on the streets get the help they need.

440
00:26:25,222 --> 00:26:26,048
Scott: Not that many though.

441
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:26,834
Scott: a lot of plague in.

442
00:26:26,895 --> 00:26:28,627
Scott: you know in Japan There's plenty of homeless people.

443
00:26:28,667 --> 00:26:32,280
Scott: but if a homeless bum tries to go to a capsule hotel They'll just run them out of there and hit him with sticks.

444
00:26:33,623 --> 00:26:35,500
Scott: Yeah, right in the US you can't do that.

445
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:44,320
Rym: The other thing is that in general, I mean even if it's not hobos It's just stuff that's in public gets pissed on and written on people got a pee.

446
00:26:44,501 --> 00:26:48,505
Scott: Well, I think a real solution to be the peeing is Public bathrooms.

447
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:50,539
Rym: Yeah, but then they get full of hobo.

448
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,772
Rym: So the New York City subway is one of the best subways in the world.

449
00:26:56,054 --> 00:26:59,038
Rym: the only factor it lacks is Cleanliness.

450
00:26:59,823 --> 00:27:01,169
Scott: Well, I mean it's so old.

451
00:27:01,229 --> 00:27:02,173
Scott: it used to be clean.

452
00:27:02,193 --> 00:27:03,860
Rym: It is relatively clean.

453
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,400
Rym: It's just that it's not that pretty on the inside.

454
00:27:08,042 --> 00:27:11,072
Rym: Meanwhile Sweden, this is some awesome shit.

455
00:27:11,132 --> 00:27:13,620
Rym: Here are just a bunch of pictures of subway stations in Sweden.

456
00:27:14,742 --> 00:27:24,700
Rym: I don't know what strikes me more the fire red sky painting on the rock the Classical statues carved into the bedrock from which the subway was wrought.

457
00:27:25,222 --> 00:27:30,056
Rym: Maybe the giant Tolkien s column that was built just in the middle for fun.

458
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:31,380
Scott: Well, Sweden's totally metal, right?

459
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,294
Rym: So yeah, there's the statue that looks like it's Odin or Thor or something.

460
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:36,900
Rym: There's a Pac Man ghost.

461
00:27:37,584 --> 00:27:39,658
Scott: Well, you know, yeah, you know goes to vote.

462
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,791
Rym: Also, it's clean enough to where I would know.

463
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,580
Scott: you think you think you're Clyde.

464
00:27:44,661 --> 00:27:47,037
Rym: I would not feel that uncomfortable rolling around naked in here.

465
00:27:48,908 --> 00:27:49,380
Scott: Is it Clyde?

466
00:27:52,524 --> 00:27:53,933
Scott: You want to roll around naked with Clyde?

467
00:27:53,974 --> 00:27:54,537
Scott: is that what it is?

468
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:59,780
Rym: But before we move on the meta moment always important the book club book is still Michio Kaku's hyperspace.

469
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,845
Rym: God has to finish reading it.

470
00:28:01,648 --> 00:28:02,572
Rym: Have you finished reading it?

471
00:28:02,733 --> 00:28:02,913
Scott: Nope.

472
00:28:03,134 --> 00:28:04,139
Rym: Will you finish reading it?

473
00:28:05,641 --> 00:28:07,270
Scott: I figure we just did a book club.

474
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,034
Scott: I give it some time.

475
00:28:08,215 --> 00:28:08,919
Scott: I didn't want to rush it.

476
00:28:09,141 --> 00:28:10,918
Rym: What are we gonna put the book club site up?

477
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,911
Rym: When I'm not lazy I did all that data entry.

478
00:28:15,951 --> 00:28:19,010
Scott: My problem is I got too many things I'm working on and I haven't.

00:28:19,211 --> 00:28:19,775
Scott: they're all 90% done.

480
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:23,720
Rym: I've gotten to the point where I have simple projects that it'll take me an hour to finish.

481
00:28:23,821 --> 00:28:25,138
Rym: I don't have a whole hour to do it.

482
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:32,918
Scott: There's an old saying in the computer world the first 90% of the work takes 90% of the time and the last 10% of the work takes the other 90% of the time.

483
00:28:34,401 --> 00:28:37,131
Scott: So I've done the first 90% of the work for like a hundred things.

484
00:28:37,191 --> 00:28:44,680
Rym: in the last 90% of the work for like one thing Yep, but independent that we've got we're gonna be a pecs Boston bitch packs.

498
00:29:29,607 --> 00:29:33,940
Rym: any quiz show no matter how simple it is will make you look stupid.

Rym: You've noticed all the people coming into the forum.

518
00:30:25,662 --> 00:30:27,691
Rym: It's not because of our show at magfest.

519
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:29,540
Rym: It is definitely because of these talkings.

520
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:34,424
Rym: yes, a lot of lurkers are coming out of the woodwork and Yeah, other than that.

526
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:52,828
Rym: Well, I do have a real 1080p 60 frames a second awesome HD camera sitting in front of me right now that I'm still learning How to use.

527
00:30:52,848 --> 00:31:01,062
Scott: yeah You spend a lot of money and then it's like you get to buy fancy golf clubs and you still hit it way out Into the woods.

528
00:31:01,404 --> 00:31:08,314
Scott: Yeah, we'll see we'll get there and I bought a thousand dollar golf club instead of $100 golf club And it's in the water, but you gave me shit about buying skis.

529
00:31:08,354 --> 00:31:09,500
Rym: You're like, how much do you ski?

530
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,959
Rym: I calculated that they've already saved me a few hundred dollars.

531
00:31:14,441 --> 00:31:15,670
Scott: Ski rental is a ripoff.

532
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:16,980
Rym: Not really a rental.

533
00:31:17,181 --> 00:31:20,814
Rym: I mean 30 bucks for a day of skiing including the sizing and the liability and everything.

534
00:31:20,854 --> 00:31:22,159
Scott: and how much is a ski?

535
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,207
Scott: 200 bucks, right?

536
00:31:24,227 --> 00:31:27,520
Scott: So if you ski like seven times, yeah, you're good.

537
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:33,256
Rym: However, if you don't take care of your skis, they will suck long before you have skied seven times.

538
00:31:33,497 --> 00:31:34,700
Scott: really they wear out that fast.

539
00:31:34,821 --> 00:31:37,595
Rym: No, it's more that they'll like rust and you probably won't know how to wax.

540
00:31:37,615 --> 00:31:38,359
Scott: They're made of metal.

541
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,505
Rym: There's edges that are metal.

542
00:31:40,605 --> 00:31:45,163
Scott: I thought they were made out of either wood or some sort of composite Situation.

543
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:48,819
Rym: they're made out of some composite with a wood or metal core.

544
00:31:49,482 --> 00:31:51,630
Rym: But the bottom surface is something called p-tex.

545
00:31:52,132 --> 00:31:54,240
Rym: p-tex which is it soaks up wet.

546
00:31:55,002 --> 00:31:55,891
Rym: I'm not gonna get into it.

547
00:31:55,911 --> 00:32:01,266
Rym: suffice to say Kind of kind of yeah Basically, I've learned I started.

548
00:32:01,467 --> 00:32:05,946
Rym: I'm at the point where I wax my own skis and I do like all my own stuff and I can Tell the difference now.

549
00:32:06,006 --> 00:32:07,819
Scott: Wait, so you put the wax on the bottom of the ski?

550
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,886
Rym: Yeah on top of the p-tex and then it melts into the p-tex And I got a melted in.

551
00:32:14,906 --> 00:32:18,320
Rym: I use a hairdryer and an iron and all this - anyway, that's crazy.

552
00:32:18,681 --> 00:32:19,544
Rym: Oh, yeah GeekNights.

553
00:32:19,906 --> 00:32:21,371
Rym: Our forum is not full of shit.

554
00:32:21,491 --> 00:32:22,094
Scott: already did that.

555
00:32:22,294 --> 00:32:22,917
Rym: Yeah, but we didn't.

556
00:32:22,997 --> 00:32:23,800
Rym: it's not every tower.

557
00:32:24,141 --> 00:32:25,809
Rym: We kick people out who can't enjoy.

558
00:32:25,829 --> 00:32:26,894
Scott: I'm saying the meta moments over.

559
00:32:26,914 --> 00:32:27,778
Rym: It's not it's over.

560
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:28,499
Rym: Yeah All right.

561
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,343
Rym: So we're doing the show on.

562
00:32:29,925 --> 00:32:39,396
Scott: we are doing the show on something we unbelievably have never done the show on before Which is one of the main most popular rising geekeries has been rising for many years.

563
00:32:39,476 --> 00:32:40,880
Scott: It's still very high up there.

564
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,054
Scott: It has not been seeing any decrease if anything.

565
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,040
Scott: It's still seeing an increase.

566
00:32:44,081 --> 00:32:45,080
Rym: It's something that you know.

567
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,300
Rym: You'd think oh this should be an anime show because you always see this at the anime cons.

568
00:32:48,622 --> 00:32:50,431
Rym: You see it just as much of the gaming cons.

569
00:32:50,732 --> 00:32:52,180
Rym: You see it at football games.

570
00:32:52,482 --> 00:32:53,832
Rym: You see it just in the street.

571
00:32:54,054 --> 00:32:54,860
Rym: You see it at parties.

572
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:55,904
Rym: This is actually.

573
00:32:55,924 --> 00:32:59,278
Rym: it's everywhere in geek culture and in non geek culture.

574
00:32:59,298 --> 00:33:02,688
Rym: Yep Of course, we're talking about the Casa play.

575
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:05,476
Rym: the Casa play a K costume wearing.

576
00:33:05,496 --> 00:33:05,997
Rym: Yes, you play.

577
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,674
Scott: Well, there's all the costume making and the costume wearing.

578
00:33:09,714 --> 00:33:10,639
Scott: are they the same right?

579
00:33:11,821 --> 00:33:13,627
Scott: Play only referred to the costume.

580
00:33:13,647 --> 00:33:17,660
Scott: not even it's just that cosplay is actually would isn't that a subset of costume wearing?

581
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:23,960
Scott: Not only are you wearing it, but you're also acting in the character or actually performing a play as that character?

582
00:33:24,322 --> 00:33:27,660
Rym: Yep, of course, then there's if you want to get to the anime stuff they get all the way down to well.

583
00:33:27,962 --> 00:33:30,819
Rym: is it the masquerade or the costume contest or the?

584
00:33:32,142 --> 00:33:36,580
Scott: Well, the costume contest judges craft the cross to making skills, right?

585
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,256
Scott: But the costume, you know masquerade counts your cosplaying skill.

586
00:33:41,296 --> 00:33:49,019
Rym: Well, it counts Never mind I I am so sick of those events that it's almost painful to talk about.

587
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:49,400
Rym: there's this guy.

588
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,429
Rym: Yeah, I know I don't know how much you have this problem.

589
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:59,185
Rym: But I mean when I put on my first suit the zipper always Lose some weight.

590
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:04,726
Scott: I Get the thing with cosplay right.

591
00:34:04,806 --> 00:34:10,141
Scott: is that you know, it's a legitimate geekery just as every other geekery is legitimate geekery Right.

592
00:34:10,202 --> 00:34:13,900
Scott: We want people to participate in as many geekeries as is possible.

593
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,900
Scott: We have no, you know, and I GeekNights.

594
00:34:16,161 --> 00:34:19,455
Scott: We love all geekeries, even if we personally don't like them like.

595
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:20,699
Scott: I personally don't like Star Trek.

596
00:34:21,202 --> 00:34:26,480
Scott: But if someone likes Star Trek, I want them to be a Star Trek geek, you know, embrace the geek domes.

597
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,485
Rym: I think whatever you are maybe are Unreadable.

598
00:34:29,505 --> 00:34:38,047
Rym: I also think Harry Potter is Awful, it is painful for me to attempt to read Harry Potter Magic by Neil Gaiman.

599
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:41,498
Rym: instead that writing is like knives into my eyes.

600
00:34:42,322 --> 00:34:46,800
Scott: I weep but you know whether we like or don't like cosplay, right?

601
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:54,940
Scott: there are many people who like or don't like cosplay or cosplayers or typical cosplayers or stereotypes of cosplaying.

602
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,051
Scott: But that doesn't mean that it's no good.

603
00:34:58,152 --> 00:34:59,879
Scott: or it should go away or we should get rid of it.

604
00:35:00,089 --> 00:35:06,244
Scott: No We should have as many geekeries as we can possibly get and we should get as many geeks as we can possibly get no matter what their geekeries may be.

605
00:35:06,585 --> 00:35:21,180
Rym: what's funny is that as a kid like the only cons I went to were basically small gaming cons like Michicon and Renaissance fairs and land parties, I guess and as a result, I never really saw a costume culture.

606
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,008
Rym: I mean Renaissance fair.

607
00:35:22,028 --> 00:35:23,220
Rym: Yeah, everyone's in a costume.

608
00:35:23,942 --> 00:35:31,915
Rym: I don't think I ever saw anyone in a costume at a gaming con as a kid except for always without Exception that one fat guy in chainmail.

609
00:35:32,157 --> 00:35:41,552
Scott: Mm-hmm The thing with cosplay right is when I was young costumes are pretty much for Halloween or for you know I guess like Broadway shows and things like that right there were.

610
00:35:41,592 --> 00:35:46,819
Scott: costumes weren't for anything else, you know I guess maybe also amusement parks that be the costumed characters, right?

611
00:35:47,500 --> 00:36:00,878
Scott: but you know early on the first anime cons I went to like Ohio con and for Otakon 02, right The cosplay was interesting to me then because it was like most.

612
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:03,870
Scott: for me At least the enjoyment was holy crap.

613
00:36:04,332 --> 00:36:06,220
Scott: That guy is in a costume.

614
00:36:06,642 --> 00:36:09,920
Scott: That is not a cut that you can't see that costume anywhere.

615
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:15,360
Scott: It's like, you know that guy's dressed up as something obscure that there is no costume you can buy in a box.

616
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:15,741
Scott: He's like.

617
00:36:15,761 --> 00:36:16,524
Scott: he's not dressed up.

618
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:26,340
Scott: as you know, a Ninja Turtle like I was for Halloween stuff is vampire hunter D. Right, and oh my god, he actually it's a high-quality costume actually looks like vampire hunter D. That's so awesome.

619
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:31,930
Scott: Or there was also the awesomeness of oh my god That cosplay is so clever and hilarious.

620
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,099
Scott: if I put a picture of that on the internet people will lol.

621
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:35,364
Rym: I Jewish wolf would.

622
00:36:35,404 --> 00:36:37,773
Rym: I was about to say Jewish wolf would pretty much wins that.

623
00:36:38,175 --> 00:36:42,893
Rym: all other things with him aside The one time he did that cosplay was also been on this show.

624
00:36:43,194 --> 00:36:44,157
Rym: He was on this show.

625
00:36:44,198 --> 00:36:49,235
Rym: Yeah We interviewed him about and some bullshit.

626
00:36:49,315 --> 00:36:51,820
Rym: Otakon drama in fact Yeah, whatever.

627
00:36:54,921 --> 00:37:03,136
Scott: So anyway see that for me that was the enjoyment of seeing cosplays was ones that were clever Ones that were like high quality like wow, look at that.

628
00:37:03,176 --> 00:37:03,920
Scott: That's pretty awesome.

629
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:08,600
Scott: Look in you know, or just you know, this the sheer novelty factor of wow, that's a costume.

630
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:09,880
Scott: You're not gonna see that anywhere.

631
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:15,200
Rym: Yeah It wasn't until RIT that I was like, oh man cuz I always liked wearing costumes like when I was in high school.

632
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:20,560
Rym: I dress up as something go to Halloween party and then I rarely had cause to ever put on a costume.

633
00:37:21,081 --> 00:37:27,420
Scott: I mean, I'm not so big a fan of wearing a costume mostly because a lot of costumes are uncomfortable, right?

634
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:36,240
Scott: Especially if there's some sort of like, you know strange Accessories involved or for like face paint, you know, it was always gonna get you all greasy and blend.

635
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:45,199
Scott: You got to wash it off, you know and that sort of stuff depending on the costume, you know Some costumes are just regular clothes and those costumes I don't have that problem with because they're just regular clothes.

636
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:51,204
Rym: But going to these cons mostly was that it was all girls dressed up and they were really cute a lot of cat girls and Sort of things.

637
00:37:51,304 --> 00:37:53,255
Rym: I was digging it already when you're very young.

638
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:56,753
Rym: Yeah I was like 19.

639
00:37:56,753 --> 00:38:00,920
Scott: Yeah, but now that's kind of scary because you're like 28 and there's then they're like 14.

640
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,232
Rym: Yeah, it's like, uh, it was better when I was 19 and they were also 19.

641
00:38:04,232 --> 00:38:06,500
Scott: It was those days are over.

642
00:38:06,761 --> 00:38:13,808
Rym: Yeah, I used to go to the masquerades too because back then I watched a few simulcast Yeah, but I mean I went to like anime central.

643
00:38:13,889 --> 00:38:17,380
Rym: I went to them and they were enjoyable to a degree.

644
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:25,220
Scott: Yeah, I mean the thing with the masquerade right which is separate at least You know at an anime con is that these people are putting on skits most of the time, right?

645
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:32,200
Scott: If you're walking across the stage It's pretty much the same as the hallway stuff except the fact that some people bring out the big guns just for that.

646
00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:39,667
Rym: So I realized something the skits are not worse than they were then but the masquerades are And I think how is that?

647
00:38:39,747 --> 00:38:46,798
Scott: so I've realized this because I mean the skits were always usually really bad Always be one or two that had something good about.

648
00:38:46,818 --> 00:38:47,079
Scott: yes.

649
00:38:47,401 --> 00:38:48,626
Rym: So here's what's different.

650
00:38:49,108 --> 00:38:54,250
Rym: every masquerade I ever went to back when I went to masquerades The whole thing was actually really short.

651
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,957
Rym: It was like a half-hour 45 minutes time.

652
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:56,963
Scott: I don't know.

653
00:38:56,983 --> 00:38:58,699
Scott: the Otakon ones are always at least an hour.

654
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,905
Rym: I never went to the fucking Otakon ones.

655
00:38:59,926 --> 00:39:03,768
Scott: I saw the simulcast while I was waiting for some horrible movie to start I knew better.

656
00:39:03,788 --> 00:39:05,080
Rym: I didn't go to the Otakon ones.

657
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:11,934
Rym: I went to the ones all these other anime cons that were smaller and they were like a half hour And every skit was like two or three minutes and they were all stupid.

658
00:39:11,954 --> 00:39:23,484
Rym: They all had time limits on them Yeah, and just because there were less of them The novelty was enough to where you could enjoy it, but I can't sit through two hours of the same gay joke Mmm.

659
00:39:23,565 --> 00:39:25,716
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I think you know the same.

660
00:39:26,058 --> 00:39:34,236
Rym: Oh shit We talk really badly and we're not actually acting and then we do the caramel dance and I think part of the.

661
00:39:34,337 --> 00:39:37,920
Scott: you know The part of the problem that they're so bad is that they have at simultaneously.

662
00:39:38,121 --> 00:39:41,460
Scott: They have too many limitations and also not enough limitations, right?

663
00:39:41,842 --> 00:39:44,960
Scott: They limit them in ways that restrict them from beat.

664
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,079
Scott: They keep them from being quality and creative like you can't futz with the lighting, right?

665
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:58,179
Scott: So I couldn't do a skit that involved like a spotlight that follows someone and then turn all the lights on and then do a blue Color, you know, yeah, so it's basically everything's lit all at once.

666
00:39:58,543 --> 00:40:04,780
Scott: So you can't even do like, you know Keep the something in the dark while you rearrange a set piece or anything like that, right?

667
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:10,399
Scott: See it that really restricts the quality of your production if you can't even control the lights or anything like that.

668
00:40:11,481 --> 00:40:26,240
Scott: And because there are so many problems of people not being able to like use microphones Properly or project their voice properly they a lot of cosplays I know do stuff where it's like you have to provide an audio file of your audio and You don't get to talk on a microphone.

669
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:26,902
Scott: There aren't any.

670
00:40:26,942 --> 00:40:29,753
Scott: so you just had to do your skit in sync with this audio.

671
00:40:29,793 --> 00:40:32,845
Scott: if that involves lip syncing or whatever I think it's easy to fix.

672
00:40:32,926 --> 00:40:39,398
Rym: and if I ran if I was ahead of cosplay at a big con like Otakon I would have this shit down so fast because I learned a lot.

673
00:40:39,498 --> 00:40:54,257
Rym: running You know the first spring cosplay at RIT anime back in the day doing our costume contest and everything and I realized if I Were Otakon or some big anime con what I would do is All year if you've got to send in a video an audition and I would pick they don't

674
00:40:54,278 --> 00:40:56,109
Scott: have those though But they do them at the con.

675
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,380
Rym: Yeah, I would do this ahead of time.

676
00:40:57,461 --> 00:41:00,944
Rym: You have to send a video like a four months Deadline ahead of the con.

677
00:41:01,386 --> 00:41:06,764
Rym: we will pick the best 10 or 15 or so and then work with them directly To have.

678
00:41:06,845 --> 00:41:09,220
Scott: I wouldn't even I wouldn't even set a number, right?

679
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,757
Scott: I would say we're only gonna pick the ones that are good enough and if it's zero, it's zero now.

680
00:41:13,818 --> 00:41:14,380
Rym: that doesn't work.

681
00:41:14,702 --> 00:41:17,080
Rym: That's actually kind of a bad way to handle it.

682
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:17,662
Rym: Why is it?

683
00:41:17,682 --> 00:41:18,968
Scott: we're all gonna be terrible anyway.

684
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:22,647
Rym: now if you set it up like that the first couple years They'd be pretty slim pickings.

685
00:41:22,687 --> 00:41:25,583
Rym: But then while you'd lose the Shitty.

686
00:41:25,623 --> 00:41:26,847
Rym: Oh wait, there's no bad drawback.

687
00:41:26,907 --> 00:41:27,429
Rym: It's perfect.

688
00:41:28,132 --> 00:41:30,199
Rym: It just requires more work on the part of the staff.

689
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:33,111
Scott: Which yeah anyway, no, but the thing is right.

690
00:41:33,131 --> 00:41:35,120
Scott: here's why I don't have confidence in this plan.

691
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,690
Scott: Right is because look at cosplay chess.

692
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,280
Scott: cosplay chess is that thing?

693
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:45,316
Scott: Basically, these people will actually meet and prepare all year for this cosplay chess.

694
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,420
Scott: They write it and prepare.

695
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:49,427
Scott: It's still terrible.

696
00:41:49,709 --> 00:41:53,807
Scott: play chess is like four hours long Even if it was only ten minutes long.

697
00:41:53,848 --> 00:41:57,280
Scott: these people practice and prepare for us so long and it's doesn't it?

698
00:41:57,521 --> 00:41:59,250
Rym: It's not good in the end or how about this?

699
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:06,320
Rym: you do the same masquerade as always But then at the end of it you show the three best skits from the separate.

700
00:42:06,722 --> 00:42:15,399
Rym: Send us a submission if you want to be the real people that get real microphone skits Mmm, so you have like the real ones like like real tear and shit tear and you separate the two.

701
00:42:16,143 --> 00:42:18,859
Scott: I guess you could do something like that, but it's not gonna help that much right?

702
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:24,800
Rym: No, well the root problem and I don't want to dwell on this much more is that people eat that up.

703
00:42:25,101 --> 00:42:28,521
Rym: You know, you know, we had a lot of feedback from Connecticut last year and very true You know.

704
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:34,863
Rym: people said the panels were the best they'd ever seen at Connecticut and they notified us of all the problems We already knew existed.

705
00:42:34,964 --> 00:42:46,373
Rym: Yeah, but like everything was great, but half of the positives we got were specific awesome panels that we agreed were awesome and the whole other half were Cosplay chess is the best thing ever.

706
00:42:46,494 --> 00:42:49,919
Rym: Oh my god, and I've seen cosplay chess.

707
00:42:51,525 --> 00:42:52,398
Rym: What the fuck?

708
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,806
Scott: People just like that shit.

709
00:42:55,329 --> 00:42:55,991
Rym: I don't get it.

710
00:42:56,132 --> 00:42:57,920
Scott: I don't get it either but they like it.

711
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,385
Scott: So let him have it.

712
00:42:59,405 --> 00:43:01,895
Rym: I say let him have it too, but I didn't.

713
00:43:01,915 --> 00:43:07,524
Rym: I was forcing me to watch it But remember, I mean we used to have to judge Costume contests.

714
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:07,987
Rym: I've done it.

715
00:43:08,047 --> 00:43:09,716
Scott: I've done it a couple times at RIT anime.

716
00:43:09,736 --> 00:43:13,259
Rym: We had to do it Yeah, and at sitcom we were actually the celebrity judges.

717
00:43:14,584 --> 00:43:29,502
Rym: That was awkward because they do their skit and then we as the judges and there were like three or four other people on the Panel would have to like ask them questions on stage and some of them were okay And some of them were really sad and it was really hard to come up with questions.

718
00:43:29,582 --> 00:43:35,980
Scott: for the thing is I don't know why we were doing that because I've never seen anyone ask questions of a skit at a Another cosplay besides that one.

719
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,185
Rym: well Because we're no to con they go up to do their skit they get off because they didn't have that many and it was a small Con and we were supposed to all be funny.

720
00:43:42,205 --> 00:43:43,610
Scott: No, okay, whatever.

721
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:54,180
Rym: Yeah, I mean for the six people in the audience it definitely was Yeah, we did cosplay like for real only once ever at.

722
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:58,138
Scott: Well, we've also there was you know, the RIT anime Club had an annual costume.

723
00:43:58,198 --> 00:44:02,760
Rym: Oh my god I was famous for my half acid not even half ass.

724
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:07,565
Rym: It was like an eighth of an ass was what I put into that cuz I had no money I had no time.

725
00:44:07,585 --> 00:44:09,272
Scott: the the oh my god is cosplay.

726
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:10,919
Rym: I think that was the best one.

727
00:44:11,664 --> 00:44:17,818
Scott: No, no that when I took our curtains I wrapped around And then you had a piece of felt that you turn that you rotated 90 degrees.

728
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,727
Scott: So it was now a diamond right?

729
00:44:19,808 --> 00:44:28,560
Rym: So there's a triangle in the front a triangle in the bag and I glued it And I put that over my shoulders and then I glued up like a diamond of felt to my forehead and I wore white pants.

730
00:44:28,962 --> 00:44:31,112
Rym: Yep, I didn't even get to shave that day.

731
00:44:31,172 --> 00:44:31,936
Rym: It looked awful.

732
00:44:31,956 --> 00:44:33,744
Scott: Yeah even I did the.

733
00:44:33,784 --> 00:44:47,144
Scott: I did the initial D car which is a car made out of poster board that I attached two LEDs to the front and Put some straps so I could wear it over my shoulders and it might still be in the anime club library somewhere Maybe they?

734
00:44:47,225 --> 00:44:48,229
Rym: we that was lost.

735
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:49,313
Rym: I heard was it?

736
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:50,096
Scott: they lost god.

737
00:44:50,116 --> 00:44:50,940
Scott: They lost my car.

738
00:44:51,141 --> 00:44:52,044
Rym: I heard the car is gone.

739
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,249
Scott: work so hard to make that car.

740
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:55,017
Rym: a lot of the things we'd left behind are gone.

741
00:44:55,057 --> 00:44:56,786
Rym: my car I did the one.

742
00:44:56,826 --> 00:44:57,369
Rym: what's his name?

743
00:44:57,389 --> 00:44:59,380
Rym: the guy the sniper guy from?

744
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,578
Rym: 8.

745
00:45:01,578 --> 00:45:08,259
Rym: I Dressed up as him because I had the trench coat add the hat but one I lost the hat so I couldn't wear it.

746
00:45:08,903 --> 00:45:10,375
Rym: So my costume was half-assed.

747
00:45:10,415 --> 00:45:17,663
Rym: to that point I basically took my trench coat taped some fake fur around the neck and then to make his shirt I took.

748
00:45:17,964 --> 00:45:25,749
Rym: I bought a square of felt and I made the front half of a shirt because I couldn't afford enough felt to also Make the back half and I duct-taped it to my chest.

749
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:34,340
Scott: one time the anime club people decided to do star ocean And I knew nothing about star being Greg dressed up as the dragons that stand on either side of the guy.

750
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,379
Rym: Yep, so I wore a red suit.

751
00:45:36,641 --> 00:45:40,877
Rym: He wore a blue suit and we taped signs written in marker to our chest.

752
00:45:40,897 --> 00:45:43,920
Scott: that said dragon Yeah, and I was supposed to be some character.

753
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:54,586
Scott: I don't even know what the character was and we basically went to the you know the goodwill and they're like bought a white shirt and a vest and then I wore rims trench coat and yeah, I guess people said That that was the character.

754
00:45:54,606 --> 00:45:55,068
Scott: I'm like, okay.

755
00:45:55,089 --> 00:45:56,959
Scott: I don't even know this character's name or anything.

756
00:45:57,781 --> 00:45:59,839
Scott: Whatever they decided on star ocean theme.

757
00:46:00,361 --> 00:46:07,692
Rym: Ah, but at that one Otakon we got a whole bunch of the front row crew like ten or so people To dress up as the axe gang.

758
00:46:07,853 --> 00:46:08,999
Scott: It was actually is pretty good.

759
00:46:09,323 --> 00:46:10,539
Scott: I realized we did a good job.

760
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,567
Rym: Exactly why people cosplay icons?

761
00:46:12,587 --> 00:46:17,571
Rym: because basically what it means is everybody's paying attention to you Even though you might not deserve it.

762
00:46:17,611 --> 00:46:22,460
Scott: Our costume was not that great No, but but there was some cleverness to it and that we actually had a gang.

763
00:46:22,641 --> 00:46:25,280
Scott: Yeah, and the axe gang was sort of an obscure thing.

764
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:30,655
Scott: So the people who are new to cons or whatever were like, oh my god There's people dressed up as a thing that you'll never see.

765
00:46:30,695 --> 00:46:31,300
Scott: people dressed up.

766
00:46:31,461 --> 00:46:34,880
Rym: Oh my god, the axe gang and we were doing the dance and we had little axes.

767
00:46:35,202 --> 00:46:35,584
Scott: Yeah, we had.

768
00:46:35,604 --> 00:46:37,453
Scott: we bought little axes from like the dollar store.

769
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:41,673
Rym: Those are actually hard to find Really little plastic axes.

770
00:46:41,693 --> 00:46:42,780
Scott: We bought the fireman's kit.

771
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:54,118
Rym: Yeah, there was that one fireman set and we bought all the ones that they had at the KB toys by RIT And we got someone else who would live further away You know, we could get a whole bunch of those at the KB toys in Atlantic City.

772
00:46:56,805 --> 00:46:57,899
Rym: But that was good times.

773
00:46:58,402 --> 00:47:03,985
Scott: Yeah, I mean it on the one hand right it was kind of annoying because it was really hot in the summer and the costume Was very warm.

774
00:47:04,045 --> 00:47:07,080
Scott: right because it was actual dress clothes and not shorts and a t-shirt.

775
00:47:07,844 --> 00:47:13,933
Scott: And also, you know, it's like if you want attention Congratulations, you've got attention and people are taking pictures of you if that's what you wanted.

776
00:47:13,953 --> 00:47:14,936
Scott: Awesome.

777
00:47:15,077 --> 00:47:21,780
Scott: You win, but Basically, you can't walk anywhere because people keep stopping you and asking you to take the picture and you're blocking the hallway and it's terrible.

778
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:25,340
Scott: All right It's kind of you actually want to do something at the con.

779
00:47:25,762 --> 00:47:30,845
Scott: You can't do it while wearing a costume even if the classroom was normal clothes which it was in that case.

780
00:47:30,865 --> 00:47:33,939
Rym: Scott made this rule and I agree with it a hundred percent and we needed to spread.

781
00:47:33,959 --> 00:47:44,809
Rym: if Anyone at a convention ever blocks a hallway to take a picture or is causing a physical space Disruption because they have a space clear to take a picture.

782
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:48,962
Rym: Just walk right through they have no right or excuse to block the hall Like that.

783
00:47:49,665 --> 00:47:50,689
Rym: just walk right through their picture.

784
00:47:50,729 --> 00:47:51,432
Rym: Just don't even care.

785
00:47:51,673 --> 00:47:53,300
Rym: I feel like everybody needs to start doing that.

786
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,087
Scott: Yeah, if they're in an aisle or whatever.

787
00:47:55,147 --> 00:47:58,660
Scott: if they're you know, do not allow someone to use walking space for picture.

788
00:47:59,884 --> 00:48:03,134
Scott: In Japan they say there's no picture-taking allowed inside.

789
00:48:03,154 --> 00:48:05,140
Scott: they don't even let cosplayers into the conventions.

790
00:48:05,241 --> 00:48:06,540
Scott: They force them to stay outside.

791
00:48:06,982 --> 00:48:09,778
Scott: They don't let them in because it blocks the hallways and it's way too crowded.

792
00:48:09,798 --> 00:48:10,763
Rym: now Don't be a dick.

793
00:48:10,783 --> 00:48:14,040
Rym: that's why you like walk over into the corner like photobomb everybody.

794
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:18,080
Scott: No, no, but go go to any blog that has pictures of Japanese cosplayers.

795
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:22,453
Scott: They will always be outside or in some sort of designated cosplaying area.

796
00:48:22,534 --> 00:48:24,640
Rym: They also put any costume I've ever seen in the u.s.

797
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:37,126
Rym: Yeah, well they put a lot more work into it and they have more skills and that's one thing I can say is that anime Cons aside like if you go to a pecs or any non anime culture con They're like the average individual.

798
00:48:37,166 --> 00:48:40,454
Rym: cosplay is higher quality and there's far fewer of them as a result.

799
00:48:40,494 --> 00:48:42,900
Rym: They garner way more attention.

800
00:48:43,301 --> 00:48:46,473
Scott: You know, I haven't really paid attention because cuz I'm so jaded.

801
00:48:46,514 --> 00:48:48,582
Rym: I don't like oh, there's a big fruit fucker Whatever.

802
00:48:48,603 --> 00:48:48,985
Rym: I mean like.

803
00:48:49,005 --> 00:48:54,795
Scott: I don't even like 40 people like oh my god Yeah, it's like at this point going to so many conventions cosplay just sort of like.

804
00:48:54,835 --> 00:48:55,920
Scott: I don't even see it.

805
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:56,201
Scott: Like.

806
00:48:56,221 --> 00:49:01,248
Scott: you have to point it out to me like look at that Like I just is.

807
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:07,180
Scott: it might as well be a person in regular clothes Like I don't even recognize it or it doesn't process in the brain whatsoever.

808
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:16,454
Scott: It has to be something way clever or way it has to stand out from the crowd Right in some way that I'll actually notice like guys on stilts.

809
00:49:16,494 --> 00:49:18,140
Rym: Don't even faze me at this point, right?

810
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:18,622
Scott: It's got it.

811
00:49:18,723 --> 00:49:24,049
Scott: Not only does it have to stand out somehow so that it catches my eye But it also has to be recognizable.

812
00:49:24,089 --> 00:49:25,354
Scott: There's so many times lately.

813
00:49:25,394 --> 00:49:34,500
Scott: My problem is I go to a con someone's cosplaying is something and I see them and I say guy and my brain says cosplay guy and that's maybe at most right.

814
00:49:35,061 --> 00:49:39,494
Scott: But that guy was actually cosplaying as something that I really like and I'm totally into.

815
00:49:39,574 --> 00:49:45,595
Scott: and later someone would be like Scott Did you see the cosplay of such-and-such from whatever?

816
00:49:45,696 --> 00:49:47,606
Scott: and I'd be like no They'd be like.

817
00:49:47,747 --> 00:49:53,940
Scott: there it is and I'm like, oh I saw that I didn't realize that's what it was because it was a cosplay didn't even enter my brain, you know.

818
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:54,683
Rym: Well, there's also.

819
00:49:54,723 --> 00:49:55,145
Rym: I've had the.

820
00:49:55,607 --> 00:49:57,034
Rym: it's funny that back in the day.

821
00:49:57,094 --> 00:50:05,135
Rym: I used to always like at conventions I dressed a lot dressed actually less nerdy geeky than I do now and I'd usually wear like a collared shirt maybe a tie like.

822
00:50:05,155 --> 00:50:08,900
Rym: I was always kind of dressed up at Conventions and people would always stop me to take pictures.

823
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,934
Rym: They thought I was cosplaying as like kaji or something or they didn't even know.

824
00:50:11,974 --> 00:50:13,159
Rym: like one time a guy stopped me.

825
00:50:13,381 --> 00:50:14,271
Scott: that does happen a lot.

826
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:21,253
Scott: when I was at ConnectiCon and we had those little headsets with the things right to walk around Somebody was like are you out?

827
00:50:21,273 --> 00:50:22,020
Scott: Uh, and I'm like what?

828
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:27,920
Scott: I was like, I thought that they were asking if I was staff and I was like, yeah I'm staff and they're like, can I take your picture?

829
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:32,800
Scott: I'm like, all right, but they were actually asking if I was a scout from Team Fortress 2 because he has the headset thing.

830
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:34,907
Scott: They thought that I was a scout.

831
00:50:34,927 --> 00:50:38,854
Rym: what I used to say is every time someone asked me I'd be like I'm dressed up as a katani from initial day.

832
00:50:39,116 --> 00:50:42,488
Scott: Yeah Whereas jeans and a polo shirt.

833
00:50:42,889 --> 00:50:45,938
Rym: Yeah, it's a key just a t-shirt jeans and a t-shirt.

834
00:50:45,998 --> 00:50:46,620
Scott: I'm it's a key.

835
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,248
Rym: third People would at one point.

836
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:51,020
Rym: I remember this very vividly.

837
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:56,780
Rym: I don't know what kind it was, but someone stopped me and they took my picture and I was like, what do you what?

838
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:57,970
Rym: do you think I'm cosplaying as?

839
00:50:58,999 --> 00:51:05,820
Rym: and He looked at me and he really didn't have an answer and he's kind of wandered away And it was just such a weird experience.

840
00:51:06,342 --> 00:51:07,827
Scott: Maybe he just you know had the hots for you.

841
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:10,738
Scott: There's a lot of those cosplay photo.

842
00:51:10,838 --> 00:51:13,156
Rym: Oh my god There's all of them Otakon.

843
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:21,000
Rym: every year There's that one fat guy who has a super awesome DSLR and he is just taking pictures of cleavage and being super creepy.

844
00:51:21,282 --> 00:51:22,794
Scott: Yeah, there's plenty of guys like that.

845
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:26,850
Scott: No shortage You know, I want to address that one issue right?

846
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:27,051
Scott: is it?

847
00:51:27,271 --> 00:51:28,416
Scott: in the cosplay community?

848
00:51:28,436 --> 00:51:29,480
Scott: There's loads of drama.

849
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,668
Rym: How do you people have so much drama?

850
00:51:31,728 --> 00:51:32,491
Rym: Jesus fucking

851
00:51:32,532 --> 00:51:47,136
Scott: Christ, but a lot of the drama is you know the way we you know the way we as you know gamers hate on for example Farmville people or the way that you know comic fans will hate on people who read the kind of comics that they don't read.

852
00:51:47,498 --> 00:51:52,940
Scott: whatever the you know, The regular superhero guys will hate the manga people and vice versa and indie people hate everybody.

853
00:51:53,145 --> 00:51:53,452
Scott: right?

854
00:51:54,141 --> 00:52:04,520
Scott: the cosplay people seem to have that same hate for the people who wear a Naruto headband and draw some whiskers on their face and Think that they're you know cosplay but they also hate each other like oh that costumes too good.

855
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,468
Rym: It was clearly mass-manufactured and I did.

856
00:52:07,508 --> 00:52:09,013
Scott: they hate anyone who buys a costume.

857
00:52:09,113 --> 00:52:18,640
Scott: also, right and it's like, you know Okay, I don't really see somebody wearing the Naruto headband the same as a Farmville player.

858
00:52:18,921 --> 00:52:25,404
Scott: I see them more as a street fighter player who mashes the buttons Doesn't get any hits.

859
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,795
Scott: right they're playing the same game, right?

860
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:30,320
Scott: They're playing the highest skill game.

861
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,927
Scott: They just have really low skill.

862
00:52:31,987 --> 00:52:34,800
Scott: Yeah, and I'm not gonna hate him cuz they're trying.

863
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,310
Scott: I mean, I'm not gonna give him any recognition cuz I suck in.

864
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:38,696
Rym: Scott don't know where they are.

865
00:52:38,977 --> 00:52:39,639
Rym: hate the game.

866
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,053
Scott: No, I'm not hating the game either or the player.

867
00:52:42,154 --> 00:52:45,329
Rym: I'm just saying man you Play if you boil it down.

868
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:46,760
Rym: It's wearing costumes in public.

869
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,631
Rym: It's just one tiny piece of social currency.

870
00:52:49,912 --> 00:52:51,879
Rym: the Naruto headband is like throwing pennies of people.

871
00:52:52,221 --> 00:52:52,603
Rym: Yeah, okay.

872
00:52:52,623 --> 00:52:53,810
Rym: I got a penny got pennies.

873
00:52:54,031 --> 00:52:54,695
Rym: I don't want a penny.

874
00:52:55,218 --> 00:52:58,351
Scott: Yep You know, and if that's you know, that's what you're gonna do.

875
00:52:58,371 --> 00:52:59,236
Scott: be my guess.

876
00:52:59,256 --> 00:53:07,792
Scott: It doesn't hurt me You know, yep, your Naruto headband isn't costing me any money But probably magfest had almost like.

877
00:53:07,933 --> 00:53:08,334
Rym: it's weird.

878
00:53:08,354 --> 00:53:13,415
Rym: It had very little cosplay That's true, but the few cut the one cosplay that stood out.

879
00:53:13,455 --> 00:53:14,620
Rym: you can tell when things stand out.

880
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,266
Scott: There's some team fortress 2 cosplay.

881
00:53:16,306 --> 00:53:19,840

Rym: It was a Tom Servo puppet that itself was dressed up as Lena inverse.

885
00:53:30,501 --> 00:53:34,394
Scott: Yes, that was crazy seeing that kind of that specific combination.

886
00:53:34,535 --> 00:53:36,100
Rym: cuz that at mag fest.

887
00:53:36,201 --> 00:53:38,634
Rym: Yeah, that's where yeah at mag fest.

Scott: Yeah, which is the convention of Colossus?

890
00:53:44,294 --> 00:53:45,197

Scott: No, but yeah That is one.

892
00:53:46,985 --> 00:53:49,740
Scott: that's back to what I was saying at the beginning about the clever cosplays.

893
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:54,855
Scott: I love clever cosplays and one subset of clever cosplay that I really like is the combo cosplay.

894
00:53:55,096 --> 00:53:56,500
Scott: you cosplay as something.

895
00:53:56,782 --> 00:53:57,975

00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:13,860
Rym: They were all freshmen in the anime club and they stole this traffic safety barrel.

901
00:54:14,443 --> 00:54:17,379
Rym: Oh, yeah, and they kept bringing it to the club like it was their friend.

902
00:54:17,419 --> 00:54:19,520
Scott: Yeah Yeah, they dressed up as a barrel.

903
00:54:19,621 --> 00:54:21,840
Rym: Well, what they do is they bring it in they'd wear shirts with it.

904
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:26,340
Rym: They like set it in a seat like it was just at the club and then at the spring cosplay.

00:54:26,701 --> 00:54:34,494
Rym: They dressed it up as Naruto and it was safety barrel Naruto and inside of it They had a guy wearing an orange shirt who I think was combat himself.

906
00:54:34,634 --> 00:54:35,960
Scott: Maybe I forget who was actually in it.

907
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:36,823
Rym: I'm pretty sure it was calm.

908
00:54:36,884 --> 00:54:38,610
Scott: It's one of those people in the trouble.

909
00:54:38,691 --> 00:54:41,927
Rym: I saw a picture of that group Not that long ago.

910
00:54:41,967 --> 00:54:43,720
Rym: I was looking through old pictures I'd taken.

911
00:54:45,022 --> 00:54:47,054
Rym: They look like like 12 year old little kids.

912
00:54:47,074 --> 00:54:51,168
Rym: They were like I Can't even get by how young they look.

Scott: But anyway, yeah, is there anything else to say about cosplays?

916
00:55:01,073 --> 00:55:02,780
Scott: I have no cosplay making skills.

917
00:55:02,981 --> 00:55:06,440
Rym: No, I'm famous for my lack of cosplaying making skills.

918
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:16,119
Scott: I guess you know cosplay does have a lot of crossover right because it crosses over into the animes and the comics and the game steampunk and the sign and the sci-fi.

919
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:20,680

Scott: Well cosplay doesn't touch every part of your life.

925
00:55:37,248 --> 00:55:40,420
