1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,656
Rym: It's Thursday, July 26th, 2012.

2
00:00:10,656 --> 00:00:16,149
Rym: I'm Rym, and I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights Tonight.

3
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:22,810
Rym: The book club, we bring you Haruki Murakami's Q-Teen 84.

4
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:23,726
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,150
Rym: Or 1Q84, as you know, I alternate the pronunciation depending on what I said last.

6
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,049
Scott: Or Ichi-Q-Hachi-On.

7
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:33,683
Rym: Yup.

8
00:00:35,714 --> 00:00:36,499
Rym: It is a trilogy.

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,330
Rym: Well, it's three books, but anyway.

10
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,999
Scott: But, yeah, in Japan, that's how they publish novels.

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,550
Scott: Like here, when you buy a novel, you get the novel, right?

12
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:49,890
Scott: In Japan, like a novel that you'll buy here that's like a lot of pages, in Japan will be like multiple small volumes.

13
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,477
Scott: You can buy little tiny books all separately.

14
00:00:52,497 --> 00:00:57,270
Scott: They break things apart, whereas here, we like to collect things together to get like the omnibus edition.

15
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,100
Rym: Ah, but at the same time, look at Books Like Prince of Nothing.

16
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,109
Rym: It has big parts that are broken up.

17
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:12,210
Scott: Right, but the thing is, in Japan, I think the reason they do that is that when you go to the bookstore, you get a whole bunch of books that are all the same size and shape, and they all just line up.

18
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,649
Scott: So it's like they just, you know, break your book apart that way.

19
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,290
Rym: You realize some of our younger listeners might be asking what you mean by a bookstore.

20
00:01:22,091 --> 00:01:31,890
Scott: It is true, but I mean, even having, even in the days of internet, right, having all the books be relatively the same size and shape is really good for robots to pick the books out to send them to you.

21
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:40,850
Rym: Well, remember a time before the industry fixed itself, when you went to buy a PC game, there was an arms race of the sizes and shapes of boxes.

22
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,419
Scott: Yeah, it was like, who can make the biggest box to stand out on the shelf?

23
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:46,270
Scott: And then they're like, all right, guys, look, all PC games will be in the same size box.

24
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:48,890
Scott: And now PC games don't even have boxes anymore.

25
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:51,787
Rym: Yep, but there was a time when you could not fit.

26
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,029
Scott: I did get Starcraft 2 in a box, and it was a standard Starcraft box.

27
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:05,430
Rym: But I mean, I have old game boxes that literally you cannot put any of them on a shelf next to any other one of them without using up the entire shelf, basically.

28
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,410
Scott: Yeah, but now you just download the books and the games.

29
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,356
Rym: Actually, you know what's crazy?

30
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:11,262
Rym: I was cleaning up stuff.

31
00:02:11,282 --> 00:02:12,369
Rym: You know what I found the other day?

32
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,273
Rym: I was in my bin of stuff to get rid of.

33
00:02:14,294 --> 00:02:23,112
Rym: I found a VHS tape and an empty beta tape case because we had a beta VCR at 1.2.

34
00:02:23,112 --> 00:02:27,850
Rym: Let me tell you, those beta cases were gigantic and had like this weird foam around them.

35
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,229
Rym: Kind of like remember the old Disney movie clamshells for VHS tapes?

36
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:31,666
Scott: Yeah.

37
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,890
Rym: They had like that soft cover with the plastic like ridges coming out.

38
00:02:36,094 --> 00:02:36,190
Rym: Yeah.

39
00:02:36,992 --> 00:02:37,507
Rym: Good times.

40
00:02:38,122 --> 00:02:38,164
Scott: OK.

41
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:39,230
Rym: I feel like anyway.

42
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,461
Scott: Let's hurry this up.

43
00:02:40,481 --> 00:02:41,310
Scott: So Google.

44
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:43,416
Scott: It's been a long time coming.

45
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:47,430
Scott: They promised they were going to bring awesome Google ISP to some city.

46
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:49,677
Rym: Never mind that we speculated as nerds.

47
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:53,790
Rym: What, like eight years ago when they started buying up dark fiber.

48
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,822
Scott: But anyway, they're going to do it in Kansas City.

49
00:02:55,862 --> 00:02:57,010
Scott: We knew this is old news.

50
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,998
Scott: But the news is that they actually.

51
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:01,970
Scott: you can now pre-register for it if you live in Kansas City.

52
00:03:02,412 --> 00:03:04,020
Scott: And they even posted the plans.

53
00:03:04,262 --> 00:03:05,508
Scott: So check out these plans.

54
00:03:05,528 --> 00:03:05,830
Scott: You ready?

55
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,795
Scott: These are unbelievable plans.

56
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:12,550
Scott: If this is available in every city, all the other ISPs and cable providers would be fucked.

57
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,032
Scott: Here we go.

58
00:03:13,073 --> 00:03:13,274
Scott: Ready?

59
00:03:13,656 --> 00:03:15,910
Scott: The middle plan, the least exciting plan.

60
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,254
Scott: Seventy dollars a month.

61
00:03:18,836 --> 00:03:19,096
Scott: Right.

62
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,019
Scott: For Internet only.

63
00:03:20,581 --> 00:03:23,810
Scott: However, it's gigabit ethernet.

64
00:03:24,532 --> 00:03:27,990
Scott: That's the least exciting plan is fucking gigabit ethernet.

65
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,880
Rym: Now, now we know that's a trillion.

66
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,310
Scott: That's a billion bits a second.

67
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,490
Rym: We know that net neutrality is already a problem in the rest of the world.

68
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,638
Rym: But regardless of how that shakes down, I'm on Google.

69
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,310
Rym: Ninety nine percent of my downloading bandwidth usage is actually not Pirate Bay anymore.

70
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,072
Rym: It's YouTube.

71
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:47,454
Scott: Right.

72
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:48,097
Scott: But here's the thing.

73
00:03:48,177 --> 00:03:51,110
Scott: So, Ram, you have files, right, which is pretty much the awesomest.

74
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:53,901
Scott: How what's the speed on that right now?

75
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:55,790
Rym: I got twenty five, twenty five.

76
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:56,894
Scott: So twenty five.

77
00:03:57,517 --> 00:03:59,346
Rym: There's a new deal for almost the same money.

78
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:00,270
Rym: I could get fifty fifty.

79
00:04:01,253 --> 00:04:01,835
Scott: So fifty.

80
00:04:02,096 --> 00:04:03,380
Scott: So let's say you get fifty fifty.

81
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,690
Scott: That's fifty megabits of fifty million bits.

82
00:04:07,311 --> 00:04:12,570
Scott: How many fifty million bits are there in a billion bits?

83
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,838
Rym: Well, how many angels can dance on the head of a pin?

84
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,244
Rym: Oh, my God, Kansas.

85
00:04:16,384 --> 00:04:17,769
Rym: Why can't you be New York?

86
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:18,250
Scott: Right.

87
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,334
Scott: So, wait, that's plan.

88
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:21,019
Scott: That's the boringest plan.

89
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:23,830
Scott: Here's the is the next plan that is more exciting.

90
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,263
Scott: The free Internet plan.

91
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:27,209
Scott: It's not totally free.

92
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:30,989
Scott: You have to pay three hundred dollar installation fee, construction fee.

93
00:04:31,049 --> 00:04:31,270
Scott: Right.

94
00:04:32,091 --> 00:04:34,197
Scott: So, but it's zero dollars a month.

95
00:04:34,257 --> 00:04:38,610
Scott: You can also finance the three hundred dollar construction fee and pay twenty five dollars a month for twelve months.

96
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,950
Scott: And then it's free from then on forward or pay three hundred lump sum and it's free forever.

97
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:45,197
Scott: And you get normal.

98
00:04:45,257 --> 00:04:48,510
Scott: It doesn't say exactly what the speed is, but you get normal Internet speeds.

99
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:51,370
Scott: Basically what I get now for nothing.

100
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:57,190
Scott: That's pretty crazy, especially for poor people can get awesome Internet.

101
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:02,426
Rym: Now, what's interesting is I don't see this reflecting in Google stock or like any.

102
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:03,830
Rym: I don't think it's only in one city.

103
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:10,009
Rym: But the plans for this, like the industry of cable provision and ISPs.

104
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:14,830
Scott: And I feel it's only one city and it's not a super major city.

105
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:24,970
Rym: Yeah, for now, it's not the smallest city now, but I note that the rest of the industry doesn't appear to be doing anything to prepare for this nuclear bomb that's about to drop.

106
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,090
Scott: Well, it's only going to hurt them if this actually branches out to places.

107
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:35,430
Scott: And if Google can actually it's costing Google, it took them a long time and a lot of infrastructure and a lot of pain in the ass to get this to even work.

108
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:39,710
Scott: So the difficulty of even getting this in New York will take many, many years.

109
00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:43,550
Scott: And our market cares about the short term, so they're not worried yet.

110
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:44,358
Scott: All right.

111
00:05:44,398 --> 00:05:45,530
Scott: Now, here's the crazy plan.

112
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,512
Scott: Are you ready?

113
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:54,830
Scott: Gigabit Internet and television, which is all, by the way, HD television with a fuck ton of channels, including the all important NFL network.

114
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:55,715
Scott: All right.

115
00:05:56,117 --> 00:05:57,889
Scott: One hundred and twenty dollars a month.

116
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,135
Scott: But here's the craziness.

117
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:07,230
Scott: Not only do you get the TV and the gigabit Ethernet, they also give behind door number three.

118
00:06:07,732 --> 00:06:11,210
Scott: You get to your contract because you're locked into this thing, right?

119
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:13,640
Scott: There's no data cap whatsoever.

120
00:06:13,661 --> 00:06:14,364
Scott: You can just go nuts.

121
00:06:14,404 --> 00:06:15,710
Scott: I don't use a data cap on any of this.

122
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:18,217
Scott: You get a Nexus seven tablet.

123
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:22,150
Scott: You get a TV box, which is like the cable box for the TV.

124
00:06:22,831 --> 00:06:24,655
Scott: You get a storage box, which is basically.

125
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:30,750
Scott: they give you a free NAS, a Google branded NAS, which is also sort of like an Apple time machine thing.

126
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,415
Scott: The network box, which is the router.

127
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:34,057
Scott: Right.

128
00:06:34,638 --> 00:06:39,530
Scott: And they give you one terabyte of space for your Google drive in the cloud.

129
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,473
Scott: So you don't have to pay for that either.

130
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:50,670
Scott: So it's even though it's one hundred twenty dollars and you're paying for TV and Internet, you get all these crazy bonuses to go with your other action.

131
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:57,810
Scott: You actually if you get the seventy dollar plan, that also includes the no data caps and the Google drive, but not any out of the stuff.

132
00:06:58,171 --> 00:07:00,117
Rym: So, Scott, I'm a reasonable man.

133
00:07:00,177 --> 00:07:01,080
Rym: This seems ludicrous.

134
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,870
Rym: Like there's no way I could possibly be a true thing.

135
00:07:04,192 --> 00:07:05,021
Rym: Sounds like a scam.

136
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:05,869
Rym: Is there any downside?

137
00:07:06,572 --> 00:07:08,416
Scott: It's a pre-registration right now.

138
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:10,922
Scott: So when they're actually going to set it up, who knows?

139
00:07:11,423 --> 00:07:14,090
Scott: It's you know, you're basically like, do they get all my info?

140
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:18,302
Scott: You're basically they get to watch me basically in the beta test for this.

141
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:20,770
Scott: So who knows how well it will actually work.

142
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:23,598
Scott: But yeah, I would sign up for this.

143
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:24,581
Rym: Oh, my God.

144
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:27,350
Rym: Yes, I've already sold my soul to Google.

145
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,025
Scott: Let's leave New York and move to Kansas City and start a nerd town there.

146
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,090
Scott: And yeah.

147
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:34,935
Scott: It's really cheap to live there.

148
00:07:37,184 --> 00:07:38,529
Rym: All right, so I might.

149
00:07:39,071 --> 00:07:42,910
Rym: Well, no, I will, because I just booked plane tickets, be in Sao Paulo next week.

150
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,330
Rym: So GeekNights between all the stuff that's going on might come or go.

151
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:49,830
Rym: But, you know, I'm going to Sao Paulo for work and I work in the stock market, everything else.

152
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:54,550
Rym: Pay attention to the stock market, but I don't work for a broker dealer so I can talk about stock stuff.

153
00:07:54,871 --> 00:07:56,690
Scott: SCC doesn't give a shit about you without getting in trouble.

154
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:57,837
Rym: SCC doesn't care.

155
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,247
Scott: SCC says you can say whatever you want.

156
00:07:59,267 --> 00:07:59,690
Scott: We don't care.

157
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:05,050
Rym: You know, I have to follow the regulations of, you know, anyone talking about stocks, obviously.

158
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:16,710
Rym: So way back, I posited that perhaps Facebook was a crass cash grab, that the IPO was ridiculous, that Facebook was peaking and that it was a poor investment.

159
00:08:17,491 --> 00:08:21,529
Rym: Well, Facebook stock has basically done nothing but go down since it IPO'd.

160
00:08:22,612 --> 00:08:28,830
Rym: And today earnings came out and Facebook dropped another like eight and a half percent.

161
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,070
Rym: And it's down even further in aftermarket trading.

162
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:32,688
Scott: All right.

163
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:37,429
Rym: And as far as I can tell, that was on the news that they beat some expectations.

164
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:40,254
Scott: Okay.

165
00:08:40,275 --> 00:08:42,169
Scott: So what did the market do today?

166
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,761
Rym: The market was up, actually.

167
00:08:45,284 --> 00:08:46,310
Rym: The market was fine.

168
00:08:47,953 --> 00:08:50,689
Scott: See, when a stock does the same thing the market did, then that means nothing.

169
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,630
Rym: Yeah, if the market was down eight and a half percent, Scott, that would be huge news.

170
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,750
Rym: The stock market dropping three percent is a pretty big deal.

171
00:08:57,911 --> 00:08:58,192
Rym: Yeah.

172
00:08:58,856 --> 00:09:01,550
Rym: So, yeah, Facebook, I've said it before, I'll say it again.

173
00:09:02,452 --> 00:09:06,210
Rym: I think Facebook has peaked or is peaking in the current, like, three year window.

174
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,270
Rym: Like, it's pretty much going to be all downhill from here.

175
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,469
Rym: Facebook is going to go the way of Myspace.

176
00:09:13,191 --> 00:09:17,090
Rym: It's just going to take longer than it took Myspace to collapse.

177
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,850
Scott: None of these things have any staying power.

178
00:09:19,413 --> 00:09:20,987
Scott: All Internet things come and go.

179
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:21,310
Scott: Right.

180
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,930
Scott: You know, one minute, you know, in our lifetimes, we've seen things.

181
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,790
Scott: We've seen many, many things that look journal.

182
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:28,452
Rym: Right.

183
00:09:28,513 --> 00:09:29,366
Rym: America Online.

184
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,351
Scott: Right.

185
00:09:30,371 --> 00:09:30,915
Rym: It's America.

186
00:09:30,935 --> 00:09:33,309
Rym: Remember, AOL, Time Warner.

187
00:09:33,851 --> 00:09:34,072
Scott: Yeah.

188
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:34,614
Scott: It's like you.

189
00:09:34,654 --> 00:09:38,050
Scott: let you go back in time and it's like, wow, Windows rules the world today.

190
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,089
Scott: No one says that, even though they still sort of do.

191
00:09:40,652 --> 00:09:40,956
Scott: AOL.

192
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:41,220
Scott: Wow.

193
00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:41,849
Scott: They're the kings.

194
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:43,041
Scott: No one can stop them.

195
00:09:43,122 --> 00:09:43,930
Scott: They run everything.

196
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:44,956
Scott: They're gone now.

197
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:46,910
Scott: Effectively, you know, mostly right.

198
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:47,593
Scott: Yahoo.

199
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:47,836
Scott: Wow.

200
00:09:47,856 --> 00:09:49,249
Scott: That's the search engine, guys.

201
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,257
Scott: No one get up.

202
00:09:50,742 --> 00:09:51,328
Scott: Oh, Google.

203
00:09:51,368 --> 00:09:51,550
Scott: Right.

204
00:09:52,732 --> 00:09:53,637
Scott: All just in need.

205
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,030
Scott: And it's only been like 20 years ish of Internet.

206
00:09:56,451 --> 00:10:02,750
Rym: So my question is, how come no one who is not a technologist ever sees this coming?

207
00:10:03,131 --> 00:10:03,293
Scott: Yeah.

208
00:10:03,455 --> 00:10:04,910
Scott: Every nothing is permanent.

209
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,679
Scott: Whatever feels like it's the unbeatable monopoly that runs.

210
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,689
Scott: everything is going to go away in less than 10 years.

211
00:10:11,191 --> 00:10:13,530
Scott: That has been the way of the Internet and the technology.

212
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:16,990
Rym: Well, if we if we widen a little bit, there was one exception.

213
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,950
Rym: Nintendo pretty much was number one for a long, goddamn time.

214
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:21,251
Rym: Yeah.

215
00:10:21,432 --> 00:10:22,477
Scott: Everything comes and goes.

216
00:10:22,638 --> 00:10:24,990
Scott: Sometimes you make a comeback, even Apple made a comeback.

217
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:25,691
Scott: Yeah.

218
00:10:25,772 --> 00:10:27,968
Scott: Nintendo sort of went away, came back when they came back.

219
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:28,150
Scott: Right.

220
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:28,933
Scott: It happens.

221
00:10:29,335 --> 00:10:32,490
Scott: But nothing is in the technology sector.

222
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:35,930
Scott: You cannot get a lock even when you were a seeming monopoly.

223
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:36,291
Scott: All right.

224
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:38,707
Scott: So things of the day.

225
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:45,216
Rym: Well, yes.

226
00:10:45,256 --> 00:10:46,930
Rym: Things of the day.

227
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:55,250
Rym: So if I had to rate jokers that I like, but if I had to rate them solely on their laugh.

228
00:10:55,772 --> 00:10:56,214
Scott: Mark Hamill.

229
00:10:56,334 --> 00:10:59,770
Rym: Mark Hamill is the undisputed champion.

230
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,850
Scott: I mean, Jack Nicholson was not too bad.

231
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,969
Rym: Jack Nicholson had a better crazy face.

232
00:11:05,952 --> 00:11:06,113
Scott: Yeah.

233
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:07,710
Scott: But I mean, his laugh wasn't bad.

234
00:11:09,798 --> 00:11:12,469
Rym: He was more like the old Batman Joker style.

235
00:11:13,031 --> 00:11:14,561
Scott: Why didn't they include the 1960s Batman laugh?

236
00:11:16,491 --> 00:11:17,241
Scott: What's his name?

237
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:17,890
Rym: Cesar Romero.

238
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:18,352
Scott: Yeah.

239
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:20,149
Scott: I knew it was like Romeo something.

240
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:23,629
Scott: How come he wasn't included in this video?

241
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,474
Scott: I don't know.

242
00:11:24,855 --> 00:11:28,070
Rym: Basically, we've got Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, and Mark Hamill.

243
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:32,030
Rym: And it is basically a compilation of different laughs that they have done.

244
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:39,270
Rym: And if you watch this, it's just going to remind you that the Joker is pretty much one of the best villains ever.

245
00:11:40,797 --> 00:11:41,045
Scott: Kind of.

246
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:42,556
Rym: All right.

247
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,929
Rym: Superhero comics.

248
00:11:44,891 --> 00:11:49,709
Rym: Name better villains that are actually better that you want to go watch stuff with them in it.

249
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:51,343
Scott: Kind of like Magneto.

250
00:11:51,364 --> 00:11:51,789
Scott: He's pretty cool.

251
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,598
Rym: Magneto is pretty good.

252
00:11:52,618 --> 00:11:53,063
Rym: He's up there.

253
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:55,535
Rym: All right, Scott.

254
00:11:55,556 --> 00:11:56,201
Rym: All right, Scott.

255
00:11:56,463 --> 00:11:57,309
Rym: DC villains.

256
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,070
Scott: A DC villain.

257
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:02,150
Rym: A DC villain that's even remotely cool.

258
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:02,813
Scott: DC villains.

259
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,209
Scott: They don't have cool villains in DC so much.

260
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,488
Rym: And yet they've got the Joker, who is almost as good as Magneto.

261
00:12:11,251 --> 00:12:17,190
Rym: Anyway, this is just cool because it reminded me of how absolutely goddamn crazy Mark Hamill sounds when he plays the Joker.

262
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:19,015
Scott: All right, so check this out.

263
00:12:19,055 --> 00:12:23,090
Scott: This is a short history of death on the New York City subway.

264
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:28,090
Scott: So it's basically a whole bunch of stories about ways people died because of the subway and such.

265
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,173
Scott: It's pretty fascinating.

266
00:12:29,835 --> 00:12:35,510
Scott: But it's also cool because this design of this web page, this little track that runs all the way down the page.

267
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:39,469
Scott: And as you scroll, this little train car drives down the web page and it's really cute.

268
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,910
Scott: But it's also rereading stories by people dying.

269
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,730
Rym: Does it talk about the 70s when hobos were pushing people out of the tracks?

270
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:54,250
Scott: Yeah, this starts talking about things as old as 1900 when they were drilling the IRT and people were getting killed during the drilling.

271
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:55,853
Rym: Wow.

272
00:12:56,033 --> 00:12:56,634
Rym: Well, that's the thing.

273
00:12:56,694 --> 00:13:05,390
Rym: New York's structures are powerful both economically and physically in direct proportion to the amount of blood of workers that is integrated into the foundation.

274
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:06,993
Scott: Here, I'll read that section for you.

275
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:15,930
Scott: When drilling began for the original Interboro Rapid Transit System in 1900, the IRT company recruited miners as skilled laborers useful for their underground experience.

276
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:24,430
Scott: The miners made $3.50 a day, which in 1900 was a lot actually, and put up with a working environment that held all the terrors of an actual mine.

277
00:13:24,811 --> 00:13:30,721
Scott: Rock slides, patches of loose gravel, and sudden encounters with underground ponds like dwarfs.

278
00:13:31,523 --> 00:13:37,550
Scott: There was a reported 16 deaths to drill the IRT in 1900.

279
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:47,830
Scott: So when you're riding on a train that's got a number on it, that's an IRT train, if it's underground, just remember that that tunnel you're in, 16 people died so that tunnel could exist.

280
00:13:47,931 --> 00:13:49,530
Scott: And that's only the beginning of this article.

281
00:13:51,294 --> 00:13:52,050
Rym: That sounds fascinating.

282
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,088
Scott: About 26 people killed themselves using the train a year.

283
00:13:56,494 --> 00:13:57,730
Rym: That's less than I expected.

284
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,230
Scott: But it claims around 200 victims total.

285
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:07,940
Rym: So back to my Joker thing, the top comment says this, "Mark Hamill sounds like a cartoon villain.

286
00:14:08,241 --> 00:14:09,944
Rym: Jack Nicholson sounds like a movie villain.

287
00:14:10,245 --> 00:14:12,068
Rym: He's ledger sounds like an actually scary

288
00:14:12,088 --> 00:14:12,769
Rym: psychopath.".

289
00:14:13,872 --> 00:14:15,828
Scott: Yeah, because he's not doing something that's unrealistic.

290
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:22,243
Rym: I think my favorite of this video, my favorite bit, is him in the actual movie where he's basically fake laughing.

291
00:14:22,263 --> 00:14:22,704
Rym: He's like, "Ha.

292
00:14:22,984 --> 00:14:23,165
Rym: Ha.

293
00:14:23,425 --> 00:14:23,586
Rym: Ho.

294
00:14:23,786 --> 00:14:23,946
Rym: Hee.

295
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:24,327
Rym: Hoo.

296
00:14:24,788 --> 00:14:24,929
Rym: Ha.

297
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:25,390
Rym: Ho.".

298
00:14:27,223 --> 00:14:27,990
Rym: Have you even seen that movie?

299
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:36,790
Rym: So in the metamoment, Otakon is this weekend and we are not there after almost a decade of going to Otakon.

300
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,730
Scott: So follow it on Twitter or be there and follow it in person.

301
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:48,770
Rym: Yes, our friend Dave Riley, who you may know from Fast Karate for the Gentlemen, is going to be there doing the same video game journalism academic panel.

302
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,449
Scott: Otakon, why are you doing video game stuff?

303
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:56,310
Rym: Hey, our biggest panel at Otakon ever in the eight years we did panels at Otakon was Beyond Dungeons and Dragons.

304
00:14:57,631 --> 00:15:02,550
Rym: But he is there doing the same panel that he ran at Kinetacon and I'm going to try to get him to come to MAGFest and do it there too.

305
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,930
Scott: He's got to go to MAGFest.

306
00:15:04,211 --> 00:15:05,153
Rym: Oh my God.

307
00:15:05,173 --> 00:15:08,422
Rym: Dave, Joel, I told you Kinetacon was fun, right?

308
00:15:08,643 --> 00:15:11,230
Rym: You realize there's an audience, you will enjoy MAGFest.

309
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,970
Rym: In fact, all of you will enjoy MAGFest.

310
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,488
Scott: MAGFest is the number one for them.

311
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:21,290
Rym: But I've got to admit, around noon, you know, because Daryl Surratt's at Otakon, none of our front row crew is there though.

312
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:25,490
Rym: Like, no one from the old, you know, our crew that would go to Otakon is going this year.

313
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,550
Scott: We're done waiting in line.

314
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:34,350
Rym: Yeah, the thing is, the rest of the crew bailed on Otakon way before we did and I think PAX actually caused them all to bail on it.

315
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:34,862
Scott: Maybe.

316
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:40,070
Rym: Because remember, it was that first year all our friends went to PAX East and then none of them went to any anime con after that.

317
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:52,750
Rym: But anyway, around noon, I remembered that for almost a decade of my life, noon on Thursday was when we'd arrive in Baltimore for our weekend of craziness and I got a little nostalgic.

318
00:15:53,411 --> 00:16:02,890
Rym: I have good memories of the Otterbean lobby and I have good memories of not waiting in line because we actually scammed our way out of waiting in that line almost every year we went.

319
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:03,527
Scott: A few times.

320
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,390
Rym: And I don't think I paid for more than one Otakon.

321
00:16:08,431 --> 00:16:14,890
Rym: The last time we skipped the line was because we got tickets to that concert outside of Otakon and they let everyone who had tickets to that skip the line.

322
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,750
Rym: I think a lot of people bought tickets just to skip the line.

323
00:16:18,652 --> 00:16:20,057
Rym: But anyway, Otakon's this weekend.

324
00:16:20,298 --> 00:16:23,730
Rym: If you want to get reports, Daryl Surratt is there and he's already put out the Twitter call.

325
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:33,690
Rym: He wants everyone who is there or who's on the internet and cares to find the creepiest missed connections from Otakon on Craigslist and forward them to him.

326
00:16:34,115 --> 00:16:34,390
Scott: Okay.

327
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,729
Rym: That is where the truth will be found.

328
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,070
Scott: Go to the Baltimore Craigslist.

329
00:16:38,391 --> 00:16:38,591
Scott: Yes.

330
00:16:38,912 --> 00:16:46,210
Rym: Also, we will be at PAX Dev doing academia versus reality games, game design, game mechanics, psychology, all that stuff.

331
00:16:47,032 --> 00:16:51,170
Rym: And we will be at PAX Prime doing three short mini panels.

332
00:16:52,132 --> 00:16:54,485
Rym: It'll be called short subjects in gaming.

333
00:16:54,505 --> 00:16:55,330
Rym: It'll be on Friday.

334
00:16:55,751 --> 00:17:01,610
Scott: And after PAX, I'm probably going to DjangoCon in DC, which means even less geek.

335
00:17:02,051 --> 00:17:05,569
Rym: And after PAX, I may be in Warsaw for a week or two.

336
00:17:07,034 --> 00:17:08,269
Scott: Things are getting crazy up in here.

337
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:15,510
Rym: Remember, GeekNights always had pseudo hiatus-i around this time between us going outside and us going to places.

338
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:19,950
Rym: Once winter comes, basically after magfest, it'll be back to normal.

339
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:21,432
Scott: I don't know.

340
00:17:21,512 --> 00:17:24,929
Scott: Historically, it's pretty much spotty the past few years.

341
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,298
Scott: The New York City era.

342
00:17:27,641 --> 00:17:28,910
Scott: You'll get an episode once in a while.

343
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:29,601
Rym: Yeah, they're coming.

344
00:17:29,642 --> 00:17:30,010
Rym: They're coming.

345
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:35,050
Rym: But yeah, like I said, I'm flying to Sao Paulo like Tuesday next week, so we'll see how many shows we do.

346
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:41,690
Scott: Oh, and the next book club, obviously not this one, is The Man Who Was Thursday.

347
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,588
Scott: I started reading it.

348
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:43,229
Rym: It's my choice.

349
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:49,330
Scott: But it's not because the book is boring, but I start reading it whenever I get in bed, and I just sort of fall asleep immediately because I'm tired.

350
00:17:50,312 --> 00:17:52,670
Scott: So I haven't read more than like three pages just because I fell asleep.

351
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:58,330
Rym: But The Man Who Was Thursday, now that we're doing 1Q84, I'm going to talk a little more about it.

352
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,581
Rym: The Man Who Was Thursday is a pretty old book.

353
00:18:00,641 --> 00:18:02,189
Rym: It's from a hundred years ago.

354
00:18:03,055 --> 00:18:06,271
Rym: Actually, more than that, 1908.

355
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:12,910
Rym: And it's a thriller set in Edwardian London back when anarchists were a big deal.

356
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:25,170
Rym: And the basic plot is that there's a cop who has to infiltrate the anarchists, and it turns out that he's a better anarchist rabble-rouser pretending to be one than any of the actual anarchists.

357
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:32,969
Rym: And then he starts to discover that maybe other people are running, other anarchist groups are cops like him, and then it just gets crazy from there.

358
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,635
Scott: The cover is pretty awesome.

359
00:18:35,655 --> 00:18:38,710
Scott: I got the Penguin book edition just because the cover was so awesome.

360
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,990
Rym: I got the 295 Kindle edition because I don't like having physical media.

361
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,899
Scott: I don't like to pay for a DRM ebook.

362
00:18:44,939 --> 00:18:47,150
Scott: I would have pirated it if I was going to get the ebook version.

363
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:51,410
Rym: But this book is mentioned in Deus Ex, so there's a little bit of a nerdy tie.

364
00:18:51,831 --> 00:19:03,566
Rym: Also, when I mentioned that I was choosing between this and The Great Gatsby, a number of not-Geeknights-listener kids, but adults, mostly fathers, were like, "Yes!

365
00:19:03,947 --> 00:19:05,228
Rym: I had to read that in school.

366
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:06,210
Rym: You should totally do

367
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:06,290
Rym: it.".

368
00:19:06,992 --> 00:19:10,787
Rym: And also one kid who was like, "No, if you do it, my dad's been trying to get me to read this

369
00:19:10,828 --> 00:19:11,289
Rym: forever.".

370
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:13,816
Rym: So, yeah, I'm doing it.

371
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:16,510
Rym: I started reading it too, and I'm liking it so far.

372
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,166
Scott: So let's talk about Qteen '84.

373
00:19:18,812 --> 00:19:19,114
Rym: Alright, 1Q84.

374
00:19:19,135 --> 00:19:21,689
Rym: So, again... It was my pick.

375
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:22,291
Rym: It was.

376
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:24,075
Rym: This is the Geeknights book club.

377
00:19:24,516 --> 00:19:29,507
Rym: Spoilers be warned beyond this line because we're talking about it as though you've already read it.

378
00:19:29,527 --> 00:19:30,770
Rym: We're not going to explain the plot.

379
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,477
Scott: So, I chose this book for a few reasons.

380
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:44,030
Scott: Reason number one, Haruki Murakami is uber-famous and pretty much every... A whole bunch of nerdy people, especially anime creators and manga artists, all cited Murakami as a major influence.

381
00:19:44,632 --> 00:19:51,590
Scott: Two, he is like the number one best-selling, oh my god, Japanese novelist of late.

382
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:57,342
Scott: And three, I saw everyone on the subway reading this frickin' book, so I'm like, "Whoa, this keeps showing up everywhere.

383
00:19:57,643 --> 00:19:58,926
Scott: This must be important.

384
00:19:59,668 --> 00:20:00,129
Scott: Let's read

385
00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:00,189
Scott: it.".

386
00:20:00,894 --> 00:20:01,729
Rym: So, we did.

387
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:06,867
Rym: Yep, and I point out that I read 1Q84 literally knowing nothing about it.

388
00:20:06,927 --> 00:20:07,890
Rym: I didn't even read the book jacket.

389
00:20:08,091 --> 00:20:08,659
Rym: I knew nothing.

390
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,409
Rym: I opened it to page one and started reading.

391
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,663
Scott: So, it was 900 pages plus until someone told me.

392
00:20:14,683 --> 00:20:16,190
Scott: I just knew what the cover looked like.

393
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,690
Rym: When I started reading it, I still didn't know it was 900 pages because I was reading the Kindle edition.

394
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:28,349
Scott: I looked at the bottom of the percentage area and someone had told me already and I clicked next page and the percentage didn't move and I was like,

395
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:28,510
Scott: "Ah.".

396
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,240
Rym: I did not notice until I got several chapters in.

397
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,103
Rym: I was like, "Wait a minute.

398
00:20:32,123 --> 00:20:32,464
Rym: What do you mean?

399
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,512
Rym: 1%?".

400
00:20:34,512 --> 00:20:36,157
Rym: So, I didn't know.

401
00:20:36,177 --> 00:20:40,170
Rym: it was about murder with needles or crazy sex.

402
00:20:40,371 --> 00:20:40,868
Rym: Or two moons.

403
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:41,809
Rym: Or little people.

404
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:42,363
Scott: Yeah.

405
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,634
Rym: And the thing is, it didn't matter.

406
00:20:44,654 --> 00:20:48,181
Rym: I was drawn in the second.

407
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:52,230
Rym: that cab driver in the opening scene said his line.

408
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,851
Scott: See, that's the thing.

409
00:20:52,891 --> 00:20:55,718
Scott: That first chapter is the only reason.

410
00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:00,330
Scott: If the second chapter was the first chapter, the book would not have happened.

411
00:21:00,495 --> 00:21:00,630
Scott: Nope.

412
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:01,092
Scott: Right?

413
00:21:01,332 --> 00:21:02,296
Scott: That first chapter.

414
00:21:02,336 --> 00:21:05,085
Scott: And you could see how all the anime creators reciting that.

415
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:05,728
Scott: It's like, "Oh my

416
00:21:05,768 --> 00:21:06,009
Scott: God.".

417
00:21:06,612 --> 00:21:08,650
Scott: Even though this came, you know, this is pretty recent, right?

418
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:09,729
Rym: Because you don't know what's going on.

419
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:14,681
Scott: It's so typical of a thing I see in animes and mangas all the time.

420
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:18,410
Scott: Somebody, a girl, you know, is in a weird situation.

421
00:21:18,831 --> 00:21:20,619
Scott: She's transferred to another world.

422
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:23,050
Scott: That might as well have been the start of Escablone right there.

423
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:27,090
Rym: She's in a normal situation and then things take a turn.

424
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:37,970
Scott: And you can already see that even though, you know, all those animes, like the very beginning of the show, there's something normal but there's also something weird.

425
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:43,665
Scott: Then you go to another world where the plot happens and at the end there's the terrible secret of space.

426
00:21:43,705 --> 00:21:45,590
Scott: that brings you back around to that stuff at the beginning.

427
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:50,430
Rym: But I noticed that the weird thing happened, but you don't know it happened until much later.

428
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,190
Scott: Well, I mean, it was so blatant right there at the beginning.

429
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,510
Rym: No, because I didn't know it was magical realism or fantasy.

430
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,670
Scott: I didn't either, but as soon as that cab driver says, what did he say?

431
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,974
Rym: Oh, he basically said, "Be careful.

432
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:11,030
Rym: Once you do something like that, once you see the world from a perspective of doing something like that, things can

433
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:11,210
Rym: change.".

434
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:11,916
Scott: Yeah.

435
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,110
Rym: Things aren't ever the same again.

436
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:16,530
Scott: I forget his exact language and I have the Kindle edition so it's hard to bring it up.

437
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:16,691
Rym: I know.

438
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:20,230
Rym: I gotta get those exact words because that is what he said there.

439
00:22:20,391 --> 00:22:22,490
Scott: Let me teleport to the beginning of the book here.

440
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:30,310
Rym: Let me try to find it because what he said there is probably my favorite moment in the book and I think it's on my list of favorite lines in books ever.

441
00:22:30,812 --> 00:22:31,408
Scott: It's pretty great.

442
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:43,650
Rym: Because when I read him saying that, one, the whole time the description of the cab up to that point, the Janicek Symphony, like just all- Dude, I went and I listened to that Janicek Symphony because it's on Spotify.

443
00:22:44,774 --> 00:22:45,530
Scott: Oh, it was really good.

444
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:53,149
Rym: I knew Janicek because of my music theory classes at both RIT and high school, but I didn't know that particular sinfonietta.

445
00:22:54,450 --> 00:23:05,790
Rym: But the description of that cab and everything, it might sound odd, but it basically reminded me very strongly of the cab driver and the surreal cab scene in Beautiful Dreamer.

446
00:23:06,031 --> 00:23:06,265
Scott: Here we go.

447
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,616
Rym: The Ursa Yatsura movie.

448
00:23:07,817 --> 00:23:10,070
Rym: Remember when they're in the cab and the cab driver's weird?

449
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,310
Scott: It does have a lot of the Ursa Yatsura weirdness.

450
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:16,350
Rym: But no, not Ursa Yatsura weirdness, Beautiful Dreamer OG weirdness.

451
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,190
Scott: That's what I'm talking about.

452
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,730
Rym: That's like saying Lupin weirdness, but you're talking about Cagliostro.

453
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,241
Scott: I found the thing here.

454
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:23,707
Rym: Okay, read it.

455
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,730
Scott: I suppose you're right.

456
00:23:26,051 --> 00:23:26,410
Scott: Okay, right.

457
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,330
Scott: And after you do something like that, the everyday look of things might seem to change a little.

458
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,770
Scott: Things may look different to you than they did before.

459
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,389
Scott: I've had that experience myself.

460
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,969
Scott: But don't let appearances fool you.

461
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,330
Scott: There's always only one reality.

462
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,908
Scott: When the guy says there's always only one reality, I'm like, oh, snap.

463
00:23:42,691 --> 00:23:44,770
Scott: You basically just told me she's going into another world.

464
00:23:44,851 --> 00:23:45,398
Scott: But it's not.

465
00:23:45,438 --> 00:23:45,823
Scott: But it is.

466
00:23:45,863 --> 00:23:46,370
Scott: But it's not.

467
00:23:47,054 --> 00:23:48,168
Scott: And that's exactly what happens.

468
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:52,130
Rym: And I was like, this is great.

469
00:23:52,251 --> 00:23:54,150
Rym: And then I follow her and I'm not really sure what's going on.

470
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,190
Rym: And then she murders that guy out of nowhere.

471
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:56,334
Rym: Yeah.

472
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:05,930
Scott: It's like, well, you know, because it's that typical thing where it's sort of the, you know, it's funny to bring this up, the concealed Chekhov's gun.

473
00:24:06,372 --> 00:24:06,573
Rym: Right.

474
00:24:06,593 --> 00:24:06,976
Scott: Where it's?

475
00:24:07,217 --> 00:24:09,370
Scott: they keep something hidden from you.

476
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,656
Scott: What is her job?

477
00:24:10,757 --> 00:24:13,130
Scott: Where does she have to get to in such a hurry?

478
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:17,350
Rym: But yet it's portrayed in such a mundane way that you think it's like a business meeting.

479
00:24:17,732 --> 00:24:18,115
Rym: Right.

480
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:19,730
Scott: But I mean, it's that same trick.

481
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:25,310
Scott: It's like you, you, you let you make it really obvious that you're hiding something.

482
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:29,150
Scott: It's like you put a curtain right there in the middle of the room and there's something behind it.

483
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:34,369
Scott: And you're like, you know, there is a curtain here with something hidden behind it.

484
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,649
Scott: And behind it is whatever she's her job is.

485
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,910
Rym: But the thing is, I looked at the curtain.

486
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,910
Rym: I'm like, yeah, it's some bullshit business meeting.

487
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,390
Rym: I wanted to know why that cab driver said what he said.

488
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:44,638
Rym: Why?

489
00:24:44,862 --> 00:24:45,209
Scott: Why did that?

490
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,410
Scott: You still don't know what the cab driver knows.

491
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:51,749
Rym: When she saw the cop and she was like, wait a minute, cops don't.

492
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,445
Scott: That was after she went through.

493
00:24:53,546 --> 00:24:53,768
Scott: Right.

494
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:54,394
Rym: Yeah.

495
00:24:54,414 --> 00:24:55,689
Rym: But even then, it was before the murder.

496
00:24:56,071 --> 00:24:59,270
Rym: So I see that and I'm like, I'm focused on that and the cab driver.

497
00:24:59,591 --> 00:25:03,430
Rym: And as I'm reading, I'm thinking back to that and the cab driver, that and the cab driver.

498
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:04,769
Rym: And then the needle comes out.

499
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:10,290
Rym: And I had my first Murakami moment, meaning you read a sentence and you stop and go, wait, what?

500
00:25:10,651 --> 00:25:12,250
Rym: And you back up and read the sentence again.

501
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,781
Rym: You're like, oh, really?

502
00:25:13,801 --> 00:25:13,881
Rym: Whoa.

503
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:18,089
Rym: So anyway, that happens like a hundred times in this book.

504
00:25:18,513 --> 00:25:19,169
Scott: A zillion times.

505
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,910
Rym: Like you read like way toward the end, even when I was expecting stuff like that.

506
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,556
Rym: I was still like toward the end.

507
00:25:24,937 --> 00:25:28,090
Rym: when they're when they're explaining why she has to kill the leader of the cult.

508
00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:29,608
Rym: I guess that's in the middle.

509
00:25:30,052 --> 00:25:32,970
Rym: And I'm reading, I'm like, destroyed uterus, like what?

510
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:40,670
Scott: So anyway, so, you know, you get the story of Aomame and she enters this crazy other world and she's an assassin.

511
00:25:40,971 --> 00:25:41,212
Scott: Right.

512
00:25:41,635 --> 00:25:44,510
Scott: And then it flips over to Tango's story.

513
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,949
Rym: As soon as I hit Tango, I'm like, I don't care about this.

514
00:25:47,352 --> 00:25:48,542
Rym: Well, I cared a lot.

515
00:25:49,671 --> 00:25:50,767
Scott: So here's the thing with Tango.

516
00:25:50,808 --> 00:25:50,950
Scott: Right.

517
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,759
Scott: So it does that trick where it's.

518
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,970
Scott: every other chapter is about the two characters.

519
00:25:55,051 --> 00:25:56,348
Scott: It goes back and forth between the two.

520
00:25:56,892 --> 00:26:00,890
Scott: So I'm reading the Tango chapters and it's like, oh, so he's a writer.

521
00:26:01,331 --> 00:26:03,028
Scott: So is that always book within a book?

522
00:26:03,691 --> 00:26:05,449
Rym: Straight up, we're going to analyze this book.

523
00:26:06,472 --> 00:26:16,110
Rym: 1Q84 is straight up allegory of the relationship between the creator and the created, and that no one can create a work like a creative work, a drawing, a novel, anything in a vacuum.

524
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,570
Rym: Everything they do is influenced by the things around them.

525
00:26:18,832 --> 00:26:21,410
Rym: And all those things together are the creator, not any one person.

526
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:21,992
Scott: Yeah.

527
00:26:22,012 --> 00:26:23,865
Scott: I mean, that's the whole thing where they're talking about how.

528
00:26:23,905 --> 00:26:26,488
Scott: like, you know, because Tango has to rewrite the book.

529
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:34,289
Rym: And then the indirect conception, what was the phrase for the indirect sex?

530
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,290
Rym: Ambiguous Congress.

531
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,149
Scott: That's right.

532
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:42,030
Rym: Like he has sex with the one girl, but really he's having sex with the other girl.

533
00:26:42,511 --> 00:26:49,910
Rym: And how that is the act of the creation of the new universe and how two people having sex and making a baby is the same as two people collaborating on a work.

534
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,030
Rym: The work is both of them, but yet it's distinct.

535
00:26:52,351 --> 00:26:53,150
Rym: That's the allegory.

536
00:26:53,472 --> 00:26:53,693
Rym: Yeah.

537
00:26:53,754 --> 00:26:56,310
Scott: It's like Fuka Eri wrote it, but Tango rewrote it.

538
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,696
Scott: So who's the real author?

539
00:26:57,717 --> 00:27:03,010
Scott: The both are, but even more than them, you know, the little people are also sort of the author if they exist.

540
00:27:04,491 --> 00:27:16,410
Scott: Anyway, so you get this Tango story and I was convinced to like halfway through the book that the Aomame chapters were actually air chrysalis.

541
00:27:18,032 --> 00:27:29,850
Scott: And there was, you know, the doubt that that was the case increased, but there was, it was always a reasonable doubt that those Aomame chapters were actually the rewritten air chrysalis.

542
00:27:30,351 --> 00:27:44,490
Scott: And I was convinced that they were so because the supernatural weird things like little people and traveling to another world and taxi drivers and such only occurred in the Aomame chapters up until very deep into the book.

543
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:51,188
Scott: And then at some point, the weird, like, you know, I think it was before the cat town, but still pretty close to it.

544
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:56,150
Rym: I found myself using the term cat town to refer to things like that.

545
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:03,170
Scott: It was very late in the book, like almost halfway through, that supernatural things were occurring in the Tango chapters.

546
00:28:03,471 --> 00:28:17,270
Scott: And also there were connections between the Aomame chapters and the Tango chapters that confirmed they were in the same world, like encountering the same people or knowing about each other and such and such.

547
00:28:17,852 --> 00:28:18,073
Scott: Right.

548
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:29,290
Scott: But it was also it was around the time that, you know, Tango talked about, you know, the the, you know, knowing Aomame from when he was in school and she was like the scary religious.

549
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,769
Rym: I want to back up a little bit because Emily showed me this when we first started reading the book.

550
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:33,294
Rym: OK.

551
00:28:33,455 --> 00:28:35,250
Rym: And it's Haruki Murakami Bingo.

552
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:41,453
Rym: And then after looking at this, I realized that many of the things like there's well, here.

553
00:28:41,493 --> 00:28:42,438
Rym: I'll go through them first.

554
00:28:42,801 --> 00:28:44,350
Rym: Here is Haruki Murakami Bingo.

555
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,256
Rym: Mysterious woman.

556
00:28:46,336 --> 00:28:46,598
Rym: Check.

557
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:46,879
Rym: Check.

558
00:28:47,543 --> 00:28:48,268
Rym: Ear fetish.

559
00:28:48,308 --> 00:28:48,570
Rym: Check.

560
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:54,750
Rym: So that's the point, because in this book, you know, there were some cute moments with ears related to sex.

561
00:28:55,130 --> 00:29:00,350
Scott: And I basically talked a lot about Fukuiri's ears and how they were covered with hair or then she could see them.

562
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,020
Rym: They'd poke out like little Alvin things.

563
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,066
Rym: You just wanted to lick them.

564
00:29:03,288 --> 00:29:03,630
Scott: Exactly.

565
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:08,430
Rym: But I thought that was a nice touch, like it was an interesting like fleshing out of this scene.

566
00:29:09,032 --> 00:29:12,649
Rym: But now looking at this bingo and seeing ear fetish as number two on the list.

567
00:29:14,051 --> 00:29:14,233
Scott: Yeah.

568
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:17,170
Scott: And the thing is, pretty much all of these things are in Qteen Eighty-Four.

569
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:21,869
Scott: I wonder, I haven't read any of other Murakami's books, but based on this bingo card.

570
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:25,410
Rym: This guy read twelve of them and three short stories and one memoir.

571
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,550
Rym: I have to assume this bingo is legit.

572
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:30,810
Scott: I have to assume that these items on this bingo are in his other books.

573
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:34,470
Scott: So I'm going to, you know, I think I'm going to read that Kafka on the Shore next because it's the most famous.

574
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:35,890
Rym: Emily read that when she said it was weird.

575
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:41,050
Scott: I'll read it eventually, but I'm pretty sure it's going to have a lot of these bingo card items.

576
00:29:41,111 --> 00:29:41,575
Rym: So let's see.

577
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:42,909
Rym: Dried up well, we didn't have.

578
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:44,612
Scott: Was there a dried up?

579
00:29:44,673 --> 00:29:50,730
Scott: well, maybe in the crazy town that was locked up where the little people were from that Fukari escaped from?

580
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:51,355
Rym: Oh, I don't remember.

581
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,286
Scott: I don't think so.

582
00:29:52,347 --> 00:29:52,570
Scott: Anyway.

583
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,803
Rym: Something vanishing.

584
00:29:53,823 --> 00:29:54,006
Rym: Yeah.

585
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,363
Rym: Feeling of being followed.

586
00:29:56,383 --> 00:29:56,969
Scott: Yeah, all the time.

587
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,925
Rym: Unexpected phone call.

588
00:29:59,107 --> 00:29:59,370
Rym: Yes.

589
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:00,232
Scott: Cats.

590
00:30:00,272 --> 00:30:02,850
Scott: Well, I mean, they did the whole thing with the phone and how he could tell.

591
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,204
Scott: He could tell who was calling based on the ring.

592
00:30:05,224 --> 00:30:05,990
Scott: What was the guy's name?

593
00:30:06,291 --> 00:30:06,715
Scott: The editor?

594
00:30:06,756 --> 00:30:08,130
Scott: It's been so long since I read it already.

595
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:08,653
Rym: Really?

596
00:30:08,815 --> 00:30:09,869
Rym: It was Komatsu.

597
00:30:10,031 --> 00:30:10,554
Scott: Komatsu.

598
00:30:10,594 --> 00:30:13,250
Scott: He could tell when Komatsu was calling because it sounded like his ring.

599
00:30:13,452 --> 00:30:13,674
Scott: Yeah.

600
00:30:13,836 --> 00:30:15,210
Scott: Or it was like he'd be like a ring.

601
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:15,716
Scott: But there's no way.

602
00:30:15,736 --> 00:30:16,505
Scott: that's Komatsu.

603
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:16,950
Scott: Cats.

604
00:30:17,311 --> 00:30:17,554
Scott: Yeah.

605
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:18,850
Rym: Old jazz record.

606
00:30:19,091 --> 00:30:19,175
Scott: Yeah.

607
00:30:19,196 --> 00:30:19,407
Scott: They would.

608
00:30:20,232 --> 00:30:23,650
Rym: His lover is his clearly murdered by her husband.

609
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,275
Rym: Exactly.

610
00:30:24,295 --> 00:30:25,850
Rym: I like how you never found out.

611
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:26,592
Rym: But you can assume.

612
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:33,110
Scott: Well, I mean, it was sort of that matched up with the story of our mommy's childhood friend who was killed by her husband.

613
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:33,511
Rym: Yes.

614
00:30:33,692 --> 00:30:38,610
Rym: And also our mommy's newer friend who was murdered randomly by strangulation.

615
00:30:38,811 --> 00:30:43,090
Rym: And then the girl he met in the cat town had a similar situation in her past.

616
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:44,533
Scott: Yeah, but she wasn't dead.

617
00:30:44,694 --> 00:30:47,966
Rym: It didn't matter because she had the vision that she knew.

618
00:30:47,986 --> 00:30:48,950
Rym: that's how she was going to die.

619
00:30:49,871 --> 00:30:59,230
Rym: The thing is, all those things are like the writer has an experience like that and then uses that element like the core of that idea in a story they write.

620
00:31:00,175 --> 00:31:01,470
Rym: You can see the allegory coming back.

621
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:04,470
Scott: I also want to point out something just sort of meta.

622
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:05,071
Scott: Right.

623
00:31:05,091 --> 00:31:08,310
Scott: I'm usually pretty bad at remembering stuff and I forgot Komatsu's name.

624
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:13,470
Scott: But look how much I remember from this book, even though I read it, you know, like a month or two ago.

625
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:15,089
Scott: Usually I would not remember this much.

626
00:31:15,653 --> 00:31:17,650
Scott: I think that is a consequence of a few things.

627
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:18,728
Scott: Number one, it's really good.

628
00:31:20,072 --> 00:31:22,089
Scott: And number two, the length of it.

629
00:31:22,471 --> 00:31:24,109
Scott: Things are repeated so much.

630
00:31:24,571 --> 00:31:24,874
Scott: Right.

631
00:31:24,954 --> 00:31:26,830
Scott: You keep seeing the same things over and over again.

632
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:27,828
Scott: So you're not going to forget them.

633
00:31:28,273 --> 00:31:30,030
Scott: Even though I forgot to take notes and I probably shouldn't.

634
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:35,709
Rym: Alright, Scott, what was the first town that Kellis gets to after he gets out of the scary place in the beginning?

635
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:36,110
Rym: First book.

636
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:36,554
Scott: Oh, fuck.

637
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:37,610
Scott: I know where it is on the map.

638
00:31:37,871 --> 00:31:38,064
Scott: I know.

639
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:43,770
Scott: And they barely even mention that he's there, but he like meets all these people there and then they all die.

640
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:50,130
Scott: He creates the Aldo and Yanni and then they all die in order for him to get to the woodsman guy.

641
00:31:50,294 --> 00:31:50,507
Scott: Yup.

642
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,569
Scott: Who is much closer to where they're at.

643
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,106
Rym: Atrathow.

644
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,389
Scott: Atrathow, that's it.

645
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:54,731
Rym: Yeah.

646
00:31:54,853 --> 00:31:56,430
Rym: Anyway, urban ennui.

647
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,477
Rym: Oh, yeah.

648
00:31:57,699 --> 00:31:59,049
Rym: I mean, urban ennui.

649
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:04,910
Rym: The picture is someone looking out at the windows that are lighted in the evening from a balcony.

650
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,190
Scott: And looking at a playground.

651
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:09,710
Scott: I mean, that's the last urban ennui, but there's plenty of other urban ennui.

652
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:13,226
Scott: Tango sitting in his apartment, bored, going to work.

653
00:32:14,171 --> 00:32:14,830
Rym: That poor rubber plant.

654
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,830
Scott: I want to get a rubber plant.

655
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:19,450
Scott: There's also, what's his name on the stakeout?

656
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:20,699
Rym: Oh, Ishikawa.

657
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,225
Rym: Uchikawa.

658
00:32:21,911 --> 00:32:24,770
Rym: Uchikawa on the stakeout has got urban ennui.

659
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:31,330
Scott: I mean, pretty much everyone is sitting around in apartments, bored, thinking and talking a whole lot.

660
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:35,028
Rym: And looking at the other people around them going, "Oh, I wonder how sad their lives

661
00:32:35,148 --> 00:32:35,228
Rym: are.".

662
00:32:35,651 --> 00:32:36,910
Rym: All right, supernatural powers.

663
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:38,310
Rym: Running.

664
00:32:38,511 --> 00:32:38,788
Rym: Check.

665
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,030
Rym: Secret passages.

666
00:32:40,734 --> 00:32:41,269
Scott: Yeah, staircase.

667
00:32:41,932 --> 00:32:42,569
Rym: Free space.

668
00:32:43,032 --> 00:32:44,990
Scott: And it's a picture of a moon and another moon.

669
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:45,581
Scott: Another moon.

670
00:32:47,036 --> 00:32:48,210
Scott: I want to talk about the two moons.

671
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:48,850
Rym: Let's get there.

672
00:32:49,231 --> 00:32:52,330
Rym: You mean how those are allegories for Aomame's breasts?

673
00:32:52,511 --> 00:32:52,747
Scott: Yes.

674
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:53,969
Rym: Train station.

675
00:32:55,101 --> 00:32:55,290
Rym: Yep.

676
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,070
Rym: They focus on the train stations a lot.

677
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,121
Rym: And he goes to that bar.

678
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,369
Scott: He uses the train to go to the cat town?

679
00:33:00,851 --> 00:33:01,770
Rym: You know what was crazy?

680
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:02,590
Scott: Reading this book.

681
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,710
Scott: Anyhow, you can't miss the last train out of the cat town?

682
00:33:05,393 --> 00:33:07,830
Rym: I was in Tokyo for a while with Emily, like two weeks.

683
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,550
Rym: Well, you know, in Japan and Tokyo.

684
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:15,710
Rym: And actually, the descriptions made a lot more sense because I'd been there.

685
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:20,530
Rym: Because train stations in Tokyo and around Japan have a particular feel to them.

686
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,689
Rym: And this book captured that.

687
00:33:22,112 --> 00:33:23,549
Rym: To a ridiculous degree.

688
00:33:24,012 --> 00:33:24,788
Scott: I know that feel, bro.

689
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,010
Rym: Historical flashbacks?

690
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:27,810
Rym: We did get that.

691
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:30,690
Rym: Remember the student protests and the whole Professor Ebisu thing?

692
00:33:31,152 --> 00:33:32,269
Scott: I guess that sort of counts.

693
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,169
Rym: Because you get the historical flashback of...

694
00:33:34,311 --> 00:33:36,187
Scott: It's a fake history, but it is sort of a...

695
00:33:36,551 --> 00:33:37,989
Rym: No, but it's tied to a real history.

696
00:33:38,111 --> 00:33:38,342
Rym: It is.

697
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,030
Rym: A precocious teenager.

698
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,048
Scott: I don't know.

699
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,389
Scott: Is Fukari precocious?

700
00:33:43,594 --> 00:33:44,505
Scott: It depends on, you know...

701
00:33:45,194 --> 00:33:46,510
Rym: I liked her as a character a lot.

702
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:46,883
Scott: Oh, yeah.

703
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:50,307
Scott: I mean, she was pretty much, you know, that sort of Aomame Rei situation.

704
00:33:51,751 --> 00:33:55,648
Scott: Like, as soon as she showed up, I'm like, "Oh, that's the magical girl who's the powerful

705
00:33:55,789 --> 00:33:55,869
Scott: one."

706
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:59,149
Scott: Like Nadia or, you know, Nausicaa or whoever you want it to be.

707
00:34:00,252 --> 00:34:01,110
Scott: Yeah, lots of cooking.

708
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,229
Rym: Speaking to cats?

709
00:34:03,076 --> 00:34:03,609
Scott: Did he speak?

710
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:04,889
Scott: Did anyone speak to a cat?

711
00:34:05,031 --> 00:34:06,369
Rym: The cat town, the cats talk to him.

712
00:34:06,931 --> 00:34:07,350
Scott: Oh, that's true.

713
00:34:08,335 --> 00:34:10,408
Scott: But no one was actually talking to cat cats.

714
00:34:11,295 --> 00:34:12,289
Rym: The owl talked to him instead.

715
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:14,047
Rym: Parallel worlds.

716
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:15,670
Scott: Yeah, that's what the book's about.

717
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:16,726
Rym: Weird sex.

718
00:34:17,274 --> 00:34:17,379
Scott: Yep.

719
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:18,728
Rym: Chip kid cover.

720
00:34:19,214 --> 00:34:19,509
Scott: Yep.

721
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:21,085
Rym: Tokyo at night.

722
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,449
Rym: Unusual name, and it has a name tag.

723
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,428
Rym: This is Aomame.

724
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,570
Rym: And the only last two, faceless villain we didn't really get.

725
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,870
Rym: Well, I guess we kind of saw the little people.

726
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:36,030
Scott: Yeah, you could stretch and say that they were faceless villains.

727
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:38,168
Rym: And vanishing cats, which we didn't get.

728
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:39,889
Scott: I don't know if there's any vanishing cats.

729
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:43,850
Scott: Someone might, you know... So precocious means unusually advanced or mature in development.

730
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,710
Scott: Especially mental development.

731
00:34:46,091 --> 00:34:53,250
Scott: So yes, Fuka Eri is incredibly precocious because she's way smarter mentally than her age, even though she's not socially developed.

732
00:34:53,793 --> 00:34:56,330
Scott: And she's also physically developed well beyond her age.

733
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:57,748
Scott: And they mention that often.

734
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,830
Scott: Like, you know, whoa, she's got like a woman's body, even though she's like a teenager.

735
00:35:03,331 --> 00:35:06,750
Rym: So we win this bingo like 11 times over.

736
00:35:10,857 --> 00:35:11,989
Rym: You wanted to talk about breasts.

737
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,170
Scott: Right, so, you know, they talk about, you know, the two moons, right?

738
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:18,890
Scott: And you only see the two moons if you're sort of in the other world, right?

739
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:19,750
Scott: And that's how you know.

740
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,490
Scott: But only certain people see the two moons.

741
00:35:21,915 --> 00:35:22,989
Scott: But they're always afraid to ask.

742
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:26,230
Scott: And they never ask anyone about the two moons, right?

743
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:27,049
Scott: No one ever asks.

744
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:28,470
Rym: And everyone thinks, "Should I ask?

745
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,429
Rym: No, that'd be crazy.

746
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:36,089
Scott: Yeah, are these other people in this world, you know, like, you know, the dowager, for example, does she see the two moons?

747
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:38,809
Scott: And that would confirm that they are all in another world.

748
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:44,648
Rym: Well, obviously it's all allegory that people don't pay attention to the greater existential world around them.

749
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:49,309
Rym: And it's possible that everyone notices them but doesn't think about it.

750
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:51,139
Rym: But we know that's not true.

751
00:35:51,461 --> 00:35:52,930
Rym: because look at the meta plot.

752
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:58,929
Rym: The book that they wrote inoculated people against the little people because it described these things.

753
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,090
Rym: It's zebra storyteller.

754
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,790
Scott: Oh, you're bringing your zebra storyteller into it?

755
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:02,989
Rym: Because it's literal here.

756
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:08,230
Rym: That book was a literal zebra storyteller that prevented the little people from doing their bullshit.

757
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:13,349
Scott: Yeah, the little people were very upset that the book was being distributed talking about them, you know?

758
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:16,028
Scott: So it very well could be what you what you say.

759
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:26,247
Scott: But anyway, you had the two moons and one was smaller than the other, you know, but they it's like one, you know, and then you also had the with the air chrysalis, you know, the maza and the dota.

760
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:27,909
Rym: Yeah, maza and dota.

761
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,290
Scott: It's like really you could have done better than that.

762
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:33,250
Scott: But I guess in Japanese, if you don't know English, that maybe works.

763
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:33,766
Scott: I don't know.

764
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:35,810
Scott: It didn't work very well as an English reader.

765
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,730
Rym: Well, I was like maza and I was like, what?

766
00:36:38,011 --> 00:36:38,370
Rym: OK, cool.

767
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:39,547
Rym: Then like dota.

768
00:36:39,951 --> 00:36:41,769
Scott: And I'm like defense of the ancients, what?

769
00:36:43,352 --> 00:36:46,770
Scott: But yeah, she had the maza and the dota with the air chrysalis.

770
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:55,670
Scott: And then you have our mom constantly, you know, going back to the fact that, you know, she doesn't like her boobs and one is different than the other.

771
00:36:55,992 --> 00:36:59,050
Scott: So you get the boobs, the moon, the maza and the dota.

772
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:05,450
Scott: It's that same repeating thing of there is a main thing and there is a second smaller offspring.

773
00:37:05,982 --> 00:37:06,170
Scott: Right.

774
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:10,570
Scott: The offspring, the creation of the thing that ties back to the writing of the book.

775
00:37:11,184 --> 00:37:11,390
Scott: Right.

776
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,950
Scott: It's it's that same thing repeated over and over again.

777
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,549
Scott: The same imagery in different forms all over the place.

778
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,750
Rym: Now, I want to take an aside.

779
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:27,050
Rym: You know, it flipped back and forth between two characters pretty much the entire time until we got Ushikawa.

780
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:27,739
Scott: Yep.

781
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:33,628
Scott: That was so weird because he's like this side character who when you first introduce him, you hate him.

782
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:34,990
Scott: Oh, he's like the worst guy.

783
00:37:35,351 --> 00:37:36,450
Rym: Like this is the sleaziest.

784
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:36,700
Scott: Yeah.

785
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:48,190
Scott: You're like finally there's a bad guy with a name that we can see who's actually doing stuff and not sort of like this mysterious little people or, you know, the mysterious leader or any of those kind of groups.

786
00:37:48,297 --> 00:37:48,470
Scott: Right.

787
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:51,989
Scott: There is a bad guy with a name and he's right there in front of you.

788
00:37:52,431 --> 00:37:56,030
Scott: And he's portrayed as like the most disgusting person.

789
00:37:56,091 --> 00:37:56,910
Scott: You don't want to be near him.

790
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,209
Scott: You don't want to talk to me or look at him.

791
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:03,450
Scott: Like I really felt like he was a slimy otaku fan boy, even though he wasn't a nerd.

792
00:38:03,591 --> 00:38:05,430
Scott: But you know, that kind of personality.

793
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:08,168
Rym: I pictured someone we won't name from RIT.

794
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:09,329
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

795
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,069
Rym: In fact, I pictured him looking exactly like that guy.

796
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:14,430
Scott: I figured him having like a little slightly longer, greasier, nasty hair.

797
00:38:14,613 --> 00:38:14,808
Scott: Yeah.

798
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:15,302
Rym: Anyway.

799
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:21,268
Rym: But then we got him his perspective and he basically became a main character up until he was killed.

800
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,027
Scott: It's like book three.

801
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,669
Scott: It's like chapter one, Ushikawa.

802
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,108
Scott: I'm like wah wah wah.

803
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:25,646
Rym: Yeah.

804
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:28,990
Rym: Again, the Murakami backs like double take.

805
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:29,470
Scott: Right.

806
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:42,770
Scott: And he's portrayed in a way that is, you know, he's still a disgusting bad person, but it's like suddenly they tell, he gives you all this information about him and shows you the side of him that you don't completely hate him.

807
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:46,390
Scott: You can sort of empathize with this aspect of him in a weird way.

808
00:38:46,471 --> 00:38:48,150
Scott: And it's like, oh, you made me hate this guy.

809
00:38:48,311 --> 00:38:49,869
Scott: And now you make me like part of this guy.

810
00:38:49,992 --> 00:38:50,568
Scott: Why you do this?

811
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:51,268
Rym: It's got to remember.

812
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:51,837
Rym: Borado.

813
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:53,094
Scott: Yeah.

814
00:38:54,574 --> 00:38:54,870
Scott: Right.

815
00:38:55,090 --> 00:39:00,450
Rym: But I really like Ushikawa as a character, as a person, still don't like him that much.

816
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:07,228
Rym: But again, I like the fact that they really make a point about how he was ugly and this was basically the only thing he could do.

817
00:39:08,293 --> 00:39:09,228
Rym: And how he did it well.

818
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,750
Rym: But he was not a professional.

819
00:39:13,031 --> 00:39:19,410
Rym: And that whole plot about Tamaru was a professional in the master Keaton sense.

820
00:39:19,697 --> 00:39:20,006
Scott: Oh, yes.

821
00:39:20,593 --> 00:39:22,410
Rym: And I really like that.

822
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:27,849
Scott: Tamaru is definitely like the king Cosmo of the book, that character that's just, oh, he's the awesomest dude.

823
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,610
Rym: But at the same time, he's a professional.

824
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:33,250
Rym: You feel bad for him in the sense that he is a master Keaton professional.

825
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,730
Rym: That is, that is his life.

826
00:39:34,812 --> 00:39:35,730
Rym: He has nothing else.

827
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:39,710
Scott: He's definitely not the happiest character, but he's just the most badass character.

828
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:46,229
Rym: Well, the fact that he pulls Astro Boy Batman, as in when Aomame calls him, he's like, yeah, I found the guy who's spying on us.

829
00:39:46,631 --> 00:39:52,429
Rym: He fucking murders the guy like straight away, just like bam, and he murders him in a super professional way.

830
00:39:52,752 --> 00:39:55,450
Rym: But yet he feels like detached and a little bad about it.

831
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:59,330
Rym: He's like, yeah, sorry, I got to kill you, but that's how it goes.

832
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:00,148
Scott: That's how it goes.

833
00:40:00,772 --> 00:40:06,808
Rym: It's also cool that like, oh, when he calls Sakagaki and he's like, you should come and pick up your package.

834
00:40:07,815 --> 00:40:08,465
Rym: I left it here.

835
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,050
Rym: Yeah, doors unlocked.

836
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:14,910
Scott: Well, and then, you know, he's he's shown in contrast to a tall guy and ponytail.

837
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:15,715
Scott: And yep.

838
00:40:15,877 --> 00:40:16,930
Scott: Who were the other guy?

839
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:24,456
Rym: Ponytail and and buzz cut buzz for dangerous and smart and, you know, masters, but not professional.

840
00:40:24,476 --> 00:40:25,430
Rym: They were not professionals.

841
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:26,650
Scott: I don't know if they were masters either.

842
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:27,696
Rym: They were just well, they were.

843
00:40:27,736 --> 00:40:29,810
Rym: no, they were masters, but they were not masters of life.

844
00:40:30,231 --> 00:40:38,096
Scott: Yeah, I wonder they were more like Bebop and Rocksteady, but I've seen a lot of Japanese works that have this idea of.

845
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:41,769
Rym: there are skilled people and then there are professionals.

846
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:51,890
Rym: and there are these stereotypes of the, quote, professional like when that term like the sushi master, the sword master, you know, the what's the guy from Killville.

847
00:40:52,250 --> 00:41:01,829
Rym: But so once you wait for and master Keaton, both Hattori Hanzo, that professional character as being also a little sad.

848
00:41:03,251 --> 00:41:09,290
Rym: And I got to find out what the actual Japanese word that was used in both of those and see if this is a trope of Japanese stuff.

849
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,710
Rym: I almost want to see if I can turn that into a panel.

850
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:12,654
Scott: I mean, that's the thing, right?

851
00:41:12,674 --> 00:41:16,093
Scott: It's like we've watched so much anime and read so much mangas, right?

852
00:41:16,395 --> 00:41:19,790
Scott: I haven't read that many Japanese novels, even translated ones.

853
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:24,330
Scott: Maybe this is might even be the first one novel I've read by a Japanese author.

854
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,770
Scott: Maybe I've read a light novel or visual or something.

855
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:27,131
Scott: I don't know.

856
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:32,548
Scott: But it's like you see, oh, it's, you know, this really.

857
00:41:32,588 --> 00:41:34,168
Scott: I've seen Japanese live action movies, too.

858
00:41:34,775 --> 00:41:36,330
Scott: And you see these tropes.

859
00:41:36,571 --> 00:41:40,170
Scott: And now I begin to see those the things that I liked in anime.

860
00:41:40,811 --> 00:41:43,770
Scott: A lot of those weren't necessarily things from anime.

861
00:41:44,131 --> 00:41:50,115
Scott: They were, you know, there were things that are common to Japanese fiction, you know, across the board.

862
00:41:50,135 --> 00:41:54,087
Scott: And that's why you get so much of the influence going in all the different directions.

863
00:41:54,860 --> 00:42:06,650
Scott: So I really now my question is, like, what is it about Japanese society and Japanese culture that has put these tropes into Japanese fiction works across all mediums?

864
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,930
Scott: Why are there so many stories about traveling to another world?

865
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:14,110
Scott: Why are there so many stories about, you know, some weird supernatural thing?

866
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:17,510
Scott: You know, why is there always some magical, mysterious, quiet girl?

867
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:18,212
Scott: Why is there?

868
00:42:18,373 --> 00:42:24,830
Scott: you know, what is it about the Japanese people and their society that makes them really like stories like this?

869
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:27,710
Scott: And why do I always like stories like that, even though I'm not from Japan?

870
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,001
Scott: You know, these are questions I don't have answers to.

871
00:42:30,383 --> 00:42:31,450
Scott: that would require some research.

872
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:36,850
Rym: Well, yeah, Tamaru gets mad points because he and, you know, the Chekhov's gun.

873
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:43,116
Rym: I like how they when Aoname asked for the gun, he gets it to her and he's like, it's Chekhov's gun.

874
00:42:43,156 --> 00:42:44,590
Rym: If I give you this is going to be fired.

875
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:45,890
Rym: Oh, I love how meta that is.

876
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:53,088
Rym: I love how it was never actually fired and how there was a forward flash to events that don't actually take place.

877
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:53,931
Rym: Yeah.

878
00:42:53,951 --> 00:43:01,609
Rym: Like when there was that forward flash to her being held by Sakagaki and like, like being forced to give birth to the baby and all those things.

879
00:43:02,734 --> 00:43:04,190
Rym: I basically expected that to happen.

880
00:43:04,652 --> 00:43:08,995
Rym: And I was like, like when she went out to trail Ushikau, I was like, fuck, this is when she's going to get kidnapped.

881
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:12,428
Rym: And then when Tamaru just fucking kills him and they get away, I was like, what?

882
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:21,590
Rym: Yeah, the fact that Chekhov's gun and Chekhov's like foreshadowing were both wrong and yet were pointed at.

883
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:24,510
Rym: I feel like every time this novel pointed me at something, it wasn't going to happen.

884
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:33,690
Scott: Well, it's weird because in a way that Chekhov's gun right was and what was fired and was not fired at the same time.

885
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:33,992
Scott: Right.

886
00:43:34,052 --> 00:43:35,823
Scott: Because, you know, a gun appears.

887
00:43:37,431 --> 00:43:37,732
Scott: Right.

888
00:43:38,094 --> 00:43:42,050
Scott: And he says in the book, a character says, you know, Chekhov, right?

889
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:45,910
Scott: He Chekhov said when a gun is in a story, it has to be fired.

890
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:49,990
Rym: But Aoname in the end, she basically said not all stories have to follow conventions.

891
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:50,572
Scott: Exactly.

892
00:43:50,732 --> 00:43:56,631
Scott: So in a way, the the item, the physical item of the gun was not the Chekhov's gun.

893
00:43:56,691 --> 00:44:03,070
Scott: The Chekhov's gun was the meta of the characters saying Chekhov's gun.

894
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:08,650
Scott: So in a way, the gun not being fired was the Chekhov's gun.

895
00:44:08,851 --> 00:44:13,710
Scott: And having it an end without being fired was it being fired.

896
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:16,149
Scott: They fired the non firing gun.

897
00:44:17,615 --> 00:44:19,209
Scott: When the book ended and it wasn't used.

898
00:44:19,714 --> 00:44:21,368
Rym: I also like to at the end, they escape.

899
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:25,716
Rym: I like how she tried to escape by just walking, you know, doing the same thing you did before.

900
00:44:25,736 --> 00:44:26,570
Scott: Well, OK, so.

901
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,189
Rym: And then later she's like, duh.

902
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:29,012
Rym: Right.

903
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:32,329
Scott: Well, when she went down the first time.

904
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:33,074
Scott: Right.

905
00:44:33,336 --> 00:44:34,829
Scott: She tried to go down and it didn't work.

906
00:44:35,491 --> 00:44:41,409
Scott: I immediately I was already thinking like 10 pages before that when she started thinking about the staircase, I was like, yeah, go up.

907
00:44:42,152 --> 00:44:44,529
Scott: And then when she went down, I was like, why didn't you go up?

908
00:44:44,971 --> 00:44:45,654
Rym: I expect.

909
00:44:45,795 --> 00:44:48,006
Scott: And then when later she went to go up, I was like, snap.

910
00:44:49,514 --> 00:44:51,790
Rym: I expected them to get into that same cab.

911
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:54,269
Scott: I was I was looking for the cab, too.

912
00:44:54,891 --> 00:45:04,090
Rym: So I was like, oh, let the cab be at the top of the staircase, especially if the cab driver, when they got into the car, was just like, I figured you'd be back.

913
00:45:04,552 --> 00:45:04,797
Rym: Yeah.

914
00:45:04,858 --> 00:45:05,489
Rym: Or something like that.

915
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:13,912
Scott: Remember, there was also these other cars on the road, like the old lady in the car, like the old rich lady in the limo or whatever, or driving the, I guess, Benz or something.

916
00:45:13,932 --> 00:45:20,970
Scott: And I was trying to make a connection between that old lady driving the car on the highway and the Dowager from the other world.

917
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:22,535
Scott: And I couldn't really.

918
00:45:22,856 --> 00:45:25,930
Scott: I was like, yeah, there wasn't really much to go on there.

919
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:35,690
Scott: But it's like when they started talking about that old lady driving on the highway, I thought of the Dowager, but I couldn't really find any specific thing that says, you know, that puts them together.

920
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:41,627
Rym: But I liked how when she they escaped and they're on the highway in the new world again, and then she looks at the S.O.

921
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:44,250
Rym: Tiger and she's like, oh, he's reversed.

922
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,008
Rym: We're in yet another different world.

923
00:45:46,391 --> 00:45:49,649
Rym: Yeah, because there are a lot of ideas in this book that you can't go back.

924
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:51,870
Rym: Well, you can't set things back.

925
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:53,450
Rym: Of course they were ever.

926
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:54,597
Rym: You're always moving forward.

927
00:45:54,657 --> 00:45:56,489
Rym: Everything you do changes reality around you.

928
00:45:57,433 --> 00:45:59,110
Rym: And it was that was just kind of ever present.

929
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:00,929
Rym: It wasn't the core of the book, but it was there.

930
00:46:01,293 --> 00:46:02,570
Rym: And I'm glad that that continued.

931
00:46:03,031 --> 00:46:03,151
Rym: Yep.

932
00:46:03,493 --> 00:46:11,894
Rym: Granted, all I thought of was that episode of The Simpsons where Homer goes back in time and keeps fucking up the future and eventually he finds the world that's close enough places.

933
00:46:12,175 --> 00:46:15,029
Scott: Things may look different to you like the S.O.

934
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:16,046
Scott: Tiger being backwards.

935
00:46:16,127 --> 00:46:16,310
Scott: Right.

936
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:20,750
Scott: Yeah, but there's only one day before I've had that experience myself.

937
00:46:20,931 --> 00:46:23,350
Scott: So the cab driver has seen this happen.

938
00:46:23,773 --> 00:46:25,770
Scott: But don't let appearances fool you.

939
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:26,874
Scott: There's only one reality.

940
00:46:26,894 --> 00:46:32,310
Scott: And when he says only one reality, I wonder, is he saying that there's only one reality?

941
00:46:32,631 --> 00:46:38,989
Scott: And when you think you're changing realities, you're really just seeing the world from a new perspective because of the things that have happened to you.

942
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:40,115
Rym: That's one way to look at it.

943
00:46:40,155 --> 00:46:42,730
Rym: Here are these things that some people might think.

944
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:43,693
Rym: Yes.

945
00:46:43,713 --> 00:46:52,190
Scott: Or the way I was seeing it is that there is one reality that contains these different universes and you're traveling between them.

946
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:55,824
Scott: So even though it's like that other universe you were in still exists.

947
00:46:56,406 --> 00:46:59,009
Scott: right in this same reality, you were there.

948
00:46:59,352 --> 00:47:02,592
Scott: Now you are here in a different in QT and 84.

949
00:47:02,592 --> 00:47:02,854
Scott: Right.

950
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,569
Scott: But you can't go back.

951
00:47:04,851 --> 00:47:06,490
Scott: It's a one way street to go to the next.

952
00:47:07,071 --> 00:47:08,770
Rym: That means that the other reality might as well not exist.

953
00:47:08,851 --> 00:47:10,270
Rym: So there still is only one reality.

954
00:47:10,431 --> 00:47:10,693
Scott: Right.

955
00:47:10,753 --> 00:47:13,070
Scott: But it does still exist somewhere.

956
00:47:13,733 --> 00:47:16,109
Rym: It doesn't matter if it exists, though, if you can't interact with it.

957
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:16,954
Scott: Yeah.

958
00:47:17,014 --> 00:47:20,331
Rym: That's just, you know, you know what, you know, where it exists in your memory and nothing more.

959
00:47:20,372 --> 00:47:25,312
Rym: The only way you even know that there was another one because things look different.

960
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:25,453
Scott: Yes.

961
00:47:25,473 --> 00:47:28,230
Scott: You remember there's a backwards thing.

962
00:47:28,311 --> 00:47:28,493
Scott: Right.

963
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,650
Scott: And how do you even know your memory?

964
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:29,891
Scott: Right.

965
00:47:29,911 --> 00:47:33,493
Scott: It's not like, well, they took a picture of the two moons and brought it with them.

966
00:47:33,533 --> 00:47:34,950
Rym: Well, and two brilliant things.

967
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:37,473
Rym: One, this was set in 1984.

968
00:47:37,473 --> 00:47:39,988
Rym: So there weren't smartphones and Internet to just have.

969
00:47:40,008 --> 00:47:40,289
Scott: that was.

970
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:41,516
Scott: Yeah, that is a very clear.

971
00:47:41,536 --> 00:47:47,690
Scott: Let's talk about that, because, you know, the level of technology that's going on in 1984 is pretty much perfect.

972
00:47:48,132 --> 00:47:48,414
Scott: Right.

973
00:47:48,555 --> 00:47:50,530
Scott: It's like you don't have the advanced technology.

974
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:59,770
Scott: So there's not a lot of plot holes because basically advanced technology, even modern technology, which is highly advanced, is like superpowers.

975
00:48:00,151 --> 00:48:04,830
Scott: We can travel around the world so fast we can communicate with anyone anywhere.

976
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:06,096
Rym: Dude, I got it so easily.

977
00:48:06,136 --> 00:48:12,910
Rym: I got a direct flight not that long ago from an airport that's really close to my house to Istanbul.

978
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:18,936
Scott: It was a nine stop nine hour 19 before they had planes, but it wasn't, you know, like it is today.

979
00:48:18,956 --> 00:48:20,184
Scott: Yeah, there was.

980
00:48:20,204 --> 00:48:21,050
Scott: there were less flight.

981
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:22,810
Rym: You'd have to go home and call someone on the phone.

982
00:48:23,294 --> 00:48:23,900
Rym: All the description.

983
00:48:23,941 --> 00:48:24,810
Scott: How do you get the plane ticket?

984
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:25,915
Scott: You just buy them on the Internet.

985
00:48:26,297 --> 00:48:32,992
Rym: All the descriptions of Uchikawa having a film camera and getting his pictures developed and having the rapid fire shutter and everything.

986
00:48:33,294 --> 00:48:33,495
Rym: Yep.

987
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:41,310
Scott: But at the same time, it wasn't so old fashioned like a Hitchcock movie, you know, where you're like stranded.

988
00:48:41,691 --> 00:48:43,889
Scott: It's like the characters could do things.

989
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:44,632
Scott: And it was.

990
00:48:44,752 --> 00:48:51,029
Scott: it was exactly right for this story to where you wouldn't have like these superpower loopholes, like, why didn't Superman just do this?

991
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:58,970
Scott: But at the same time, you weren't so limited that it was boring, like, oh, he just said it in like 1910, you know, before there were cars.

992
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:01,650
Scott: So they had to have a foot race and he get caught.

993
00:49:01,851 --> 00:49:04,890
Rym: And I liked how mommy, when she saw the moon, she's like, was it always that way?

994
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:05,740
Rym: Am I just crazy?

995
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:05,841
Rym: Yeah.

996
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:10,553
Rym: Which is a very and then she's like, no, if I even consider that I'm crazy, then I'm probably not.

997
00:49:11,558 --> 00:49:19,330
Rym: But that moment where Tango is looking up at the moon and Uchikawa was watching him and Uchikawa was like, what the fuck is he doing?

998
00:49:20,072 --> 00:49:29,452
Rym: And then Uchikawa looks up and sees the two moons like, oh, like that moment where he shows that he was a person who had never looked up.

999
00:49:30,418 --> 00:49:32,250
Rym: Almost everyone in the world had never looked up.

1000
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:34,070
Rym: Looking up is clearly a metaphor.

1001
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:38,469
Scott: Yeah, but but it's you know, but it's it's just, you know, it's an aspect of him.

1002
00:49:38,489 --> 00:49:47,110
Scott: that's like, you know, what happens when a person who is probably, you know, sure, no, hardly anyone has looked up, but the person who has really never looked up as Uchikawa.

1003
00:49:47,411 --> 00:49:47,672
Scott: Yeah.

1004
00:49:48,053 --> 00:49:56,230
Scott: So when a person who has never looked up, the person farthest from the up lookers looks up, it's like, look what happened there.

1005
00:49:56,652 --> 00:49:56,935
Scott: Right.

1006
00:49:57,339 --> 00:49:58,450
Scott: Just totally blown away.

1007
00:49:58,973 --> 00:50:02,432
Rym: So let's get back to a little bit what the cab driver said, because we both experienced this.

1008
00:50:02,997 --> 00:50:04,690
Rym: How many didn't we just talked about it?

1009
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:07,489
Rym: How many years did we go to Otakon and love it?

1010
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:16,929
Rym: And we were like panelists, but joining the staff, working the artist alley, going to PAX as a guest speaker instead of an attendee.

1011
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:25,230
Rym: Once you see conventions from those perspectives, if you go to a normal convention as an attendee again, everything you see, everything completely differently.

1012
00:50:25,652 --> 00:50:25,833
Scott: Oh, yeah.

1013
00:50:25,853 --> 00:50:28,990
Rym: I mean, you can never see it any other way again.

1014
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:30,316
Scott: I really think that was like.

1015
00:50:30,377 --> 00:50:42,910
Scott: the part of the book I enjoyed more than anything else is even though he's describing these supernatural experiences that would never happen to any real person, somehow they relate to things that really happened to me, at least in my real life.

1016
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:45,110
Scott: Well, that can be something in a different way.

1017
00:50:45,191 --> 00:50:47,590
Scott: And now I can't see it the old way ever again.

1018
00:50:48,051 --> 00:50:52,410
Rym: That I had some sort of just had he went to an anime con and then he helped run it.

1019
00:50:52,952 --> 00:50:58,310
Scott: I had some sort of surreal experience that might as well have been little people, but it wasn't actually little people.

1020
00:50:58,410 --> 00:50:59,256
Scott: It was just dream.

1021
00:50:59,297 --> 00:51:01,090
Rym: I like how they were actually Asian.

1022
00:51:01,772 --> 00:51:04,770
Rym: I really liked how they were actually literally just little people.

1023
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:06,210
Scott: Yeah, that was kind of weird.

1024
00:51:06,951 --> 00:51:07,233
Scott: Right.

1025
00:51:07,434 --> 00:51:15,250
Scott: You know, the air chrysalis where, you know, you work hard on creating something, you know, with with, you know, your hard work night after night.

1026
00:51:15,391 --> 00:51:22,310
Scott: And then when it forms, you know, not only have you created a new thing, but now you're also seeing things differently and you're a new person.

1027
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:29,490
Scott: You know, it's it's like, oh, you know, every one of those things, even though I did not literally make an air chrysalis or whatever.

1028
00:51:30,051 --> 00:51:30,312
Scott: Right.

1029
00:51:30,332 --> 00:51:36,529
Scott: I'm sure all of you listening as well, you have done all the things that have happened in this book, you know, including not shoot someone.

1030
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:38,630
Scott: Right.

1031
00:51:39,333 --> 00:51:43,269
Scott: You know, being paranoid about people watching you, you know, all this stuff.

1032
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:46,810
Rym: You know, I haven't said I really like this book.

1033
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:47,557
Scott: Oh, really?

1034
00:51:47,658 --> 00:51:48,549
Scott: You don't say.

1035
00:51:49,251 --> 00:51:50,787
Rym: I really, really enjoyed it.

1036
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:51,411
Scott: Yeah.

1037
00:51:52,378 --> 00:51:54,090
Scott: Scott, picking the books that people enjoy.

1038
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:54,962
Scott: That was a good book.

1039
00:51:55,267 --> 00:51:55,409
Scott: Yeah.

1040
00:51:56,172 --> 00:51:57,179
Scott: Do you want to say anything else?

1041
00:51:57,502 --> 00:51:58,590
Scott: Oh, I do want to say one thing.

1042
00:51:58,871 --> 00:51:59,542
Scott: Right.

1043
00:51:59,725 --> 00:51:59,949
Scott: In this.

1044
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,410
Rym: OK, because I have one like big thing I want to say.

1045
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:03,639
Rym: It's the only thing I dislike.

1046
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:04,910
Scott: Mine's meta so you can go.

1047
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:12,490
Rym: OK, so the one thing that pissed me off is that the plot to kill the leader of Sakigake was bullshit.

1048
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:14,209
Rym: That was a stupid plot.

1049
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:16,649
Scott: Wasn't the dumbest plot.

1050
00:52:16,872 --> 00:52:17,156
Rym: No, no.

1051
00:52:17,216 --> 00:52:18,129
Rym: Here's why it was dumb.

1052
00:52:18,692 --> 00:52:32,709
Rym: The whole point of her killing him, as opposed to someone else or some other way, was that she can kill people in a way to where no autopsy can possibly figure it out, that it appears to be a natural death.

1053
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:42,310
Rym: Had she not disappeared and emptied her apartment and made it obvious that she had killed him, there is no way they would have known.

1054
00:52:42,672 --> 00:52:47,176
Rym: And she was a public enough figure because of her work where they couldn't have just disappeared her.

1055
00:52:48,042 --> 00:52:49,270
Rym: That's sort of true.

1056
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:53,670
Rym: Unlike Komatsu, who was such a recluse, it was trivial to disappear him.

1057
00:52:53,911 --> 00:52:54,814
Scott: That's sort of true.

1058
00:52:54,855 --> 00:53:03,605
Scott: But at the same time, right, if you're the last person to see a dead person and you killed the leader of a crazy cult, they're probably going to come after you anyway.

1059
00:53:04,591 --> 00:53:08,006
Scott: So your best bet is to run away and hide, even if it gives you away.

1060
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:14,947
Rym: She had blackmail on them in that she knew the leader was dead.

1061
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:15,649
Rym: if they go to her.

1062
00:53:16,553 --> 00:53:17,528
Scott: That crazy storm is here.

1063
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:19,173
Rym: That's meta.

1064
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:22,270
Rym: We're watching a crazy thunderstorm roll over New York City.

1065
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:23,568
Rym: We've been waiting for this all day.

1066
00:53:25,251 --> 00:53:30,910
Scott: OK, so the meta I want to talk about is in the back of this edition I have on my Kindle that I illegally acquired.

1067
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:33,510
Scott: There's questions for discussion.

1068
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:34,508
Rym: I had that, too.

1069
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:38,110
Scott: And some of these are the lamest book club questions.

1070
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:38,772
Rym: Oh, my God.

1071
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:39,256
Rym: I looked at that.

1072
00:53:39,297 --> 00:53:40,810
Rym: I was like, what is this third grade?

1073
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:44,930
Scott: I was like, when I saw that, I was like, OK, I saw it said questions for discussion.

1074
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:49,207
Scott: And I was like, oh, there's a chance that these a very small chance.

1075
00:53:49,247 --> 00:53:49,950
Scott: these could be good.

1076
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:51,630
Scott: And maybe we'll use them on the book club episode.

1077
00:53:52,211 --> 00:53:55,629
Scott: They're pretty much universally bad book club questions like the first one.

1078
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:58,110
Scott: 1Q84 is a vast and intricate novel.

1079
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:02,589
Scott: What are the pleasures of reading such a long work of staying with the same characters over such a long period of time?

1080
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:03,373
Scott: Really?

1081
00:54:03,393 --> 00:54:05,190
Scott: That's that's your book club question.

1082
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:08,210
Scott: These are questions for the old lady Barnes and Noble book club.

1083
00:54:09,031 --> 00:54:12,244
Rym: You know, so a few people.

1084
00:54:12,265 --> 00:54:13,570
Rym: I was reading some reviews of it.

1085
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:16,330
Rym: There were a few like literary people, most pretty much everyone.

1086
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:19,509
Rym: The critical reviews of this were just like, this is the best book.

1087
00:54:20,334 --> 00:54:21,509
Rym: But some people hated it.

1088
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:32,333
Rym: And pretty much the people who hated it all said that it was tone deaf, dialog, unyielding plot that goes nowhere, lazy and cliched, and that the little people were not menacing.

1089
00:54:32,916 --> 00:54:35,310
Scott: That last one, little people are supposed to be men.

1090
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:37,509
Rym: Those little people were menacing as well.

1091
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:43,857
Scott: The thing is, on the one hand, they weren't supposed to be directly menacing, like you think they're going to come out and kill.

1092
00:54:43,877 --> 00:54:53,170
Rym: you read when you get the actual story of air chrysalis of her sitting there with the little people and they're making the thing and ho ho, said the keeper of the beat.

1093
00:54:53,751 --> 00:54:57,750
Rym: They just oozed something bad about to happen.

1094
00:54:58,090 --> 00:54:58,332
Scott: Exactly.

1095
00:54:58,373 --> 00:55:00,070
Scott: It's like, what the hell are they up to?

1096
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:03,470
Scott: And it's like everyone was always, always on their guard.

1097
00:55:03,571 --> 00:55:05,330
Scott: Like you don't want to upset the little people.

1098
00:55:05,652 --> 00:55:06,076
Scott: You know why?

1099
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:07,630
Scott: It's like the eye of Sauron.

1100
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:09,498
Scott: It's like, OK, is it?

1101
00:55:09,518 --> 00:55:11,446
Scott: can it really do anything directly besides?

1102
00:55:11,527 --> 00:55:12,129
Scott: look at you?

1103
00:55:12,691 --> 00:55:13,254
Scott: Not so much.

1104
00:55:13,314 --> 00:55:16,833
Scott: But if it sees you, the Nazgul will come and I do not want his baleful gaze upon.

1105
00:55:16,934 --> 00:55:17,195
Scott: Right.

1106
00:55:17,215 --> 00:55:20,755
Scott: So but it's like the little people, it's like you didn't want them to see you.

1107
00:55:20,795 --> 00:55:22,006
Scott: They were up to something.

1108
00:55:22,046 --> 00:55:22,450
Scott: no good.

1109
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:23,334
Scott: They were mysterious.

1110
00:55:23,374 --> 00:55:30,970
Scott: You couldn't reach them, but it felt like they could always reach you, you know, and especially since the way they behaved was so creepy.

1111
00:55:31,611 --> 00:55:36,830
Scott: It's it's like, you know, one of those aliens or horror movies where just there's an alien doing weird stuff.

1112
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:42,739
Scott: He's not directly attacking or biting or shooting or, you know, whatever, but they're doing weird stuff.

1113
00:55:42,759 --> 00:55:43,889
Scott: What the hell are they up to?

1114
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:44,712
Scott: Oh, my God.

1115
00:55:45,435 --> 00:55:49,070
Scott: Yeah, not not would not want to have some little people hanging out.

1116
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:58,168
Scott: And it was also menacing because once, you know, like the little people that crawl out of someone's body any time, like someone was going to sleep, I was like, oh, my God, little people are going to come out.

1117
00:55:58,431 --> 00:56:01,710
Scott: Yeah, I mean, they exploded that day in the room and see the little people come out.

1118
00:56:02,293 --> 00:56:03,928
Rym: When they exploded that dog.

1119
00:56:04,693 --> 00:56:05,240
Scott: Yeah, right.

1120
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,030
Rym: That was crazy.

1121
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:06,692
Scott: Yeah.

1122
00:56:06,712 --> 00:56:09,550
Scott: Anyone who explodes a dog from the inside is menacing.

1123
00:56:09,731 --> 00:56:11,929
Rym: Yeah, I was expecting a person to explode after that.

1124
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:12,575
Scott: I know.

1125
00:56:12,657 --> 00:56:12,860
Scott: Right.

1126
00:56:12,881 --> 00:56:13,329
Scott: Never happened.

1127
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:14,097
Scott: I was worried.

1128
00:56:14,117 --> 00:56:15,109
Rym: I was waiting for it.

1129
00:56:17,052 --> 00:56:18,317
Scott: All right.

1130
00:56:19,181 --> 00:56:20,105
Scott: Is there anything else we can?

1131
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:21,491
Scott: I mean, we could talk about this for a long time.

1132
00:56:21,632 --> 00:56:22,234
Rym: I could I could.

1133
00:56:22,294 --> 00:56:30,610
Rym: I could basically spend about a half hour outlining my whole like all the evidence for the allegory of the relationship between creator and created.

1134
00:56:30,711 --> 00:56:32,630
Rym: But I think it's self-evident.

1135
00:56:32,932 --> 00:56:34,470
Scott: It's pretty it's extremely self-evident.

1136
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:41,229
Scott: It's even one of the stupid questions which says, in what ways does Qteen eighty four question and complicate conventional ideas of authorship?

1137
00:56:41,571 --> 00:56:44,370
Scott: How does it blur the line between fictional reality and ordinary reality?

1138
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:45,550
Scott: Those two questions are unrelated.

1139
00:56:46,431 --> 00:56:51,656
Scott: But the first question is conventional ideas of authorship, which is yeah, that's one of the primary things about them.

1140
00:56:51,676 --> 00:57:00,412
Scott: But the other thing is, you know, a lot of books, you know, great books sort of have a main point, you know, like Lord of the Flies, main point.

1141
00:57:00,512 --> 00:57:06,429
Scott: Look how people behave when they're left to their own devices, you know, in a animal farm, communism.

1142
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:07,352
Scott: Right.

1143
00:57:07,432 --> 00:57:12,030
Scott: When you have a book like this, there's actually multiple main points.

1144
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:15,309
Scott: He's got so many pages to work with and so much going on.

1145
00:57:15,693 --> 00:57:17,310
Scott: You know, there isn't just one main point.

1146
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:26,773
Scott: It's like, here are all these points coming from the same story, you know, and look how these points tie into each other, sort of, you know, and there is no one simple thing saying.

1147
00:57:26,813 --> 00:57:28,510
Scott: the book is saying this.

1148
00:57:28,851 --> 00:57:40,110
Scott: It's like the book is saying all these things and all those things create together, create a mosaic or tapestry that becomes the message of the book that you can't necessarily say in one sentence.

1149
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:44,949
Rym: And there are just so many great scenes that just pound those ideas in.

1150
00:57:45,592 --> 00:57:49,630
Rym: And the scenes themselves are great, almost like though it didn't tie them together.

1151
00:57:49,731 --> 00:57:51,510
Rym: Well, think about Boondock Saints as a movie.

1152
00:57:52,391 --> 00:57:57,850
Rym: Every individual scene was amazing, but the thread through them was pretty weak.

1153
00:57:58,931 --> 00:58:04,312
Rym: This book had scenes like that, but the threads through them were so numerous and so strong.

1154
00:58:05,034 --> 00:58:10,130
Rym: Like, remember when the NHK collector started knocking on all the doors?

1155
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:10,939
Scott: Oh, when he's not.

1156
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:11,490
Scott: Oh, my God.

1157
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:12,850
Rym: Every one of those scenes was great.

1158
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:21,849
Rym: And when the one moment when Uchika was there and the guy knocks on his door, I was like, yes, Uchika was going to get a picture of this fucker.

1159
00:58:22,214 --> 00:58:22,904
Rym: And then he didn't.

1160
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:24,548
Rym: Yeah, I was like, no.

1161
00:58:26,152 --> 00:58:29,570
Scott: Oh, that was that whole sequence with the knocking that the dad.

1162
00:58:29,833 --> 00:58:30,650
Scott: I know you're in there.

1163
00:58:31,192 --> 00:58:33,950
Scott: It's like, oh, my God, that was genius.

1164
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:35,950
Rym: Everything about this book is just great.

1165
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:36,592
Scott: All right.

1166
00:58:37,802 --> 00:58:38,790
Scott: If you didn't read it already.

1167
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:42,190
Rym: Yeah, if you didn't read it, you should read it, even though we just spoiled everything.

1168
00:58:42,772 --> 00:58:43,097
Scott: Yeah.

1169
00:58:43,118 --> 00:58:43,910
Scott: All right.

1170
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:47,150
Scott: I'm going to try to get home before I get lightning or whatever.

1171
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:47,631
Rym: All right.

1172
00:58:47,651 --> 00:58:51,150
Rym: So we out there may or may not be shows next week.

1173
00:58:51,371 --> 00:58:53,469
Rym: They'll probably at best be a Monday show.

1174
00:58:54,117 --> 00:58:55,150
Rym: And then I'll be in Sao Paulo.

1175
00:58:56,550 --> 00:59:06,180
Rym: And yeah, this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1176
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:07,318
Rym: Special thanks to D.J.

1177
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:11,320
Rym: Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for Web Design and Brando Kay for the logos.

1178
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:16,763
Scott: Be sure to visit our Web site at front row crew dot com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1179
00:59:17,004 --> 00:59:24,380
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows, SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.
