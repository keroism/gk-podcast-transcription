1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,909
Rym: It's Tuesday, December 9th, 2014.

2
00:00:10,909 --> 00:00:11,109
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,120
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,504
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,564 --> 00:00:17,190
Rym: Tonight, Wizard.

6
00:00:17,772 --> 00:00:19,036
Rym: Behold his power.

7
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:23,709
Scott: Nah.

8
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:26,498
Rym: Let's do this.

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:32,039
Rym: AKA the breakout game for GeekNights at PAX Australia, but we'll get to that.

10
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:43,696
Rym: So, I've been, you know, it's been mostly animation season for me, so I've been watching a lot of cartoons and things lately, and I have been playing a lot of games, but I've mostly just been playing Smash Bros.

11
00:00:43,736 --> 00:00:44,820
Rym: and Counter-Strike.

12
00:00:45,362 --> 00:00:46,419
Scott: I've been playing a lot of games.

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,460
Rym: And a lot of tabletop.

14
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,320
Scott: I played the South Park game, which I gotta finish that.

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,900
Rym: Oh yeah, I keep forgetting to get that and play it.

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,526
Scott: Well, you missed the sale.

17
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:54,880
Scott: I don't know if it's worth paying full price.

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,260
Rym: Yeah, I'll get it somehow.

19
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,098
Scott: I got a lot of 3DS action going on.

20
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:01,776
Rym: I got a lot of 3DS action going on, a lot of Smash Bros.

21
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:02,219
Rym: going on.

22
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,699
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of stuff, so.

23
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:04,878
Rym: No, just Smash Bros.

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,149
Scott: There's NES Remix.

25
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:08,557
Scott: P-Cross E5.

26
00:01:09,563 --> 00:01:10,080
Rym: P-Cross.

27
00:01:10,481 --> 00:01:10,758
Scott: P-Cross.

28
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:20,140
Rym: Those games, my feelings about them are the same way you feel about Myst in terms of, like, how much fun it is as a game.

29
00:01:21,343 --> 00:01:21,999
Scott: Myst isn't that bad.

30
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:23,189
Rym: No, Myst is okay.

31
00:01:23,392 --> 00:01:23,959
Rym: You're fine with Myst.

32
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,020
Rym: I mean, this Myst has- Are you fine with Sudoku and crossword puzzles?

33
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:30,400
Scott: I mean, P-Cross is just better Sudoku.

34
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:32,332
Rym: So, you're fine with Sudoku.

35
00:01:32,352 --> 00:01:35,280
Scott: You're fine with that- Well, Sudoku's just really bad compared to P-Cross.

36
00:01:35,624 --> 00:01:35,899
Rym: How so?

37
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:39,459
Scott: It's way, way easier and less fun.

38
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,606
Scott: So, how is- But it's basically the same.

39
00:01:41,949 --> 00:01:43,319
Scott: Mathematically, it's the same deal.

40
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:46,060
Rym: But you have fun playing P-Cross?

41
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,079
Scott: Yeah, when you do P-Cross, like, at the end.

42
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,660
Scott: See, when you finish a crossword puzzle, right?

43
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,438
Scott: Crossword puzzles at least have some trivia and maybe you learn some knowledge, right?

44
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:56,000
Scott: Knowledge-based.

45
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:56,400
Scott: Yeah.

46
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,460
Scott: Sort of like Scrabble, right?

47
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,580
Scott: Sudoku, it's like, okay, Sudoku's like, you know, brain exercise.

48
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,212
Scott: But when you finish a Sudoku, what do you have?

49
00:02:04,232 --> 00:02:05,079
Scott: A box full of numbers.

50
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,079
Scott: P-Cross is also sort of a math exercise just like Sudoku is.

51
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,300
Scott: Except when you finish a P-Cross, first of all, P-Cross is better.

52
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,860
Scott: Especially because you get really big, crazy ones that are way more complicated and harder than any Sudoku.

53
00:02:20,623 --> 00:02:23,340
Scott: But when you finish a P-Cross, there's a picture that is revealed.

54
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:24,707
Scott: It's like, "Yay, it's Turtle.

55
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:25,794
Scott: Yay, it's

56
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:25,975
Scott: Mario.".

57
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,520
Rym: Great, a pixelated monochromatic turtle.

58
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,060
Scott: Yay, but if you play it in the DS, it turns into a color turtle.

59
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,440
Rym: But you didn't make that color playing P-Cross.

60
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,680
Scott: There is actually, the 3DS version doesn't have it, but there are color P-Crosses.

61
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,719
Rym: No, why don't you play those?

62
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,818
Scott: Because they're not in the 3DS.

63
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,080
Rym: Yeah, but honestly, lately, I've been pretty much playing Counter-Strike.

64
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:55,400
Rym: And while there is definitely an old man limit to my ability to click heads, I am getting better again.

65
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:56,839
Scott: You clicked one head.

66
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,896
Rym: I'm doing okay.

67
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,100
Rym: It's interesting because I'm getting to the point where when I play on puppies, occasionally someone good will join.

68
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:08,480
Rym: But usually now, I'm either the best person on the server, or at least I'm the best person on my team.

69
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,600
Rym: However, Valve, this isn't my news, this is kind of a thing I've noticed.

70
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:23,800
Rym: Basically, they've done these packs where you can pay money to basically get priority access to different kinds of loot drops and different new maps that are in rotation.

71
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,018
Scott: Operation Vanguard or some shit?

72
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:26,960
Rym: Operation fucking bullshit.

73
00:03:27,961 --> 00:03:29,000
Scott: Pay money for nothing.

74
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,240
Scott: The same shit they have in Dota.

75
00:03:31,222 --> 00:03:33,980
Scott: Buy the Dota Compendium, get a bunch of digital nothing.

76
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:44,180
Rym: I paid for the first one because the way it was framed was that the money was distributed among the people, the fans, who made the crazy awesome new maps.

77
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:44,900
Scott: Yep, that's true.

78
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,400
Scott: And in Dota 2, when you pay money, it goes into the pot for the world champions.

79
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:54,580
Rym: And unlike Dota, where it's just skins and stuff, this was actual maps, like really good maps, like CS Thunder quality maps.

80
00:03:54,883 --> 00:03:55,420
Scott: Oh, okay.

81
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,859
Scott: Yeah, but also it lets you- Can you just get those maps by joining a server that's playing those maps?

82
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,039
Rym: Yes, and basically what happened was- And you don't have to pay for them?

83
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,280
Rym: Well, what happened was, one, the money just went to those people, which is cool.

84
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:06,720
Rym: That's fine.

85
00:04:07,386 --> 00:04:07,975
Rym: It's like tipping.

86
00:04:07,995 --> 00:04:09,639
Scott: But two- I'll tip people who make Counter-Strike maps.

87
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:19,480
Rym: For the month or two or whatever that the past thing was active, basically anyone who paid for it had priority access to a whole bunch of servers they spun up and ran that were only running those maps.

88
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,420
Scott: Official Valve servers?

89
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,400
Rym: Because very few people run their own Counter-Strike servers anymore.

90
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:25,922
Scott: Really?

91
00:04:25,942 --> 00:04:28,220
Scott: Because Valve is running a bunch of them, no one needs to run their own?

92
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:35,800
Rym: Yeah, like the people who run them now either run default ones that don't do anything special, and most people don't go to a name of a server, like they don't join.

93
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,995
Scott: Yeah, they don't use the server browser, they just say, "Play

94
00:04:38,036 --> 00:04:38,540
Scott: Counter-Strike.".

95
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:50,400
Rym: But here's what happened now, because of the loot drops and the missions, and it's all just cosmetic bullshit, people are getting really invested in this, and it has ruined the casual mode of Counter-Strike.

96
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,420
Scott: So when you join a casual game of Counter-Strike, people aren't playing Counter-Strike?

97
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:54,758
Rym: People are literally like, "No,

98
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:54,839
Rym: man.".

99
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,939
Scott: They're just trying to get loot.

100
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,622
Rym: "No, man.

101
00:04:56,683 --> 00:04:57,025
Rym: No, man.

102
00:04:57,126 --> 00:04:57,991
Rym: I just need eight more kills.

103
00:04:58,051 --> 00:04:58,816
Rym: I don't give a fuck about the

104
00:04:58,856 --> 00:04:59,138
Rym: bomb.".

105
00:04:59,500 --> 00:04:59,742
Scott: Yep.

106
00:05:00,406 --> 00:05:02,520
Scott: This is what TF2 did, too, with the hats.

107
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,406
Rym: Yeah, so you know what?

108
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:05,140
Rym: I can't play Casual mode anymore.

109
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:09,219
Scott: It makes a lot of money for Valve, but it makes the game garbage, because everyone's griefing.

110
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,045
Rym: So I can't play Casual Counter-Strike anymore.

111
00:05:13,185 --> 00:05:23,260
Rym: I can play Demolition mode, because at least that mode, because it starts so close to the action, and is so quick, it's not as fucked as the casual mode is.

112
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,520
Scott: Well, gun game is okay.

113
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,122
Rym: But here's my problem.

114
00:05:26,162 --> 00:05:41,100
Rym: What I really need is the server- Because the server I ran, the only reason I got rid of the Geeknight server, like, people used it occasionally, and I would use it a lot.

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,280
Rym: But it was a pain in the ass to administer, because administering Counter-Strike servers- Maybe that's why there's so few servers out there.

116
00:05:47,461 --> 00:05:48,460
Rym: Yes, it's a fucking pain in the ass.

117
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,107
Scott: If I worked for Valve, that's the one thing.

118
00:05:50,428 --> 00:05:53,140
Scott: In Valve, they say you're allowed to work on whatever you want there, right?

119
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:55,820
Rym: I would work on, yeah, the interface to run a Counter-Strike server.

120
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,160
Scott: I would work on making it easier to run servers, starting with Counter-Strike, and then moving over to the other one.

121
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,381
Scott: Because

122
00:06:01,421 --> 00:06:22,740
Rym: basically what I want is a server that follows most of the game rules of, like, competitive mode servers, but with half as many rounds, so you can go through maps quicker, and switching teams, and the right number of player limits, and cool map rotations, and basically having a server that's cool, and I don't want to actually run it in any capacity.

123
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:35,880
Scott: Yeah, it's like, there's been this history of any game where you run your own server, you then have to get a bunch of community hacks and mods, and they're really hard to install, because there's no official way to do it, and you just put a bunch of files in folders, and hope stuff works, and edit text configuration files-

124
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,716
Rym: Well, and the documentation is just like, there is no

125
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:38,220
Scott: real documentation.

126
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:39,559
Scott: And the documentation is garbage, right?

127
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,020
Scott: Anything that the community feels should be put in, like, NS2 even had this.

128
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:48,540
Scott: You had NS2, and then there were all these mods you had to make to your NS2 server.

129
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,836
Scott: They should have just changed the official NS2 server to include every single one of these features that the community was adding.

130
00:06:55,116 --> 00:06:56,520
Scott: that was good, right?

131
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,166
Scott: So that you never had to mod the server.

132
00:06:58,186 --> 00:07:07,820
Scott: You just push the buttons and start server, and then there'd be a nice, gooey configuration, that had all the advanced crazy shit that everyone needed to configure the perfect server exactly the way they wanted.

133
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,320
Rym: Yup.

134
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:08,921
Scott: Right?

135
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:13,460
Scott: And then, if you do that, a lot of people will be able to run servers really easily.

136
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:19,960
Rym: So, basically what I'm thinking is, I'm not going to run a server, because, guys, I'm an IT professional.

137
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,640
Rym: Like, I'm a senior, serious IT guy.

138
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,340
Scott: The only thing harder than configuring a game server like this is configuring an email server.

139
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,180
Rym: I was about to say, email is the only, like, good email is the only thing I've ever failed to successfully run.

140
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:38,319
Rym: I don't think anyone has successfully run good email.

141
00:07:39,421 --> 00:07:42,860
Rym: Except maybe Google, Microsoft, yeah, anyway.

142
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:53,936
Rym: So, if any listeners out there run a Counter-Strike server or want to run one just on your own, I'm not saying I'll pay for it, but I might just give you a bunch of money.

143
00:07:53,976 --> 00:07:54,680
Rym: I don't care, really.

144
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,120
Rym: Because they're not expensive to get the hosting, but if you'll manage it...

145
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,260
Scott: It is if you want a lot of players and you want it to be fast.

146
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,271
Rym: Yeah, even then, it's not.

147
00:08:02,371 --> 00:08:03,380
Rym: Scott, by our standards, it's not.

148
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,679
Scott: And public ones are more money, too.

149
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,603
Rym: It's still not.

150
00:08:05,824 --> 00:08:16,260
Rym: The amount of money I was paying for that Counter-Strike server, which was, like, a pretty high-performance server, you spend more than that on lunch, like, by Wednesday for a month.

151
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,304
Rym: It was not a lot of money.

152
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:30,715
Rym: I just don't want to deal with all the bullshit, but if someone has a server and you just want more people on it, I will happily make that also the, "Hey, if you're playing Counter-Strike, that's the semi-official, all GeekNights fans, go play there,".

153
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:31,860
Rym: so we have our community thing.

154
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,919
Scott: And then you have that problem where everyone's online and everyone's looking at the empty server, not joining it.

155
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:44,612
Rym: Yep, but then I will do what I did on the other server, which every time I join, I'll just go to the server and invite a bunch of people, and if no one joins me, then fuck you.

156
00:08:44,632 --> 00:08:46,140
Rym: That's what I do.

157
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:51,140
Rym: Anyway, so in the news, there's some Counter-Strike news.

158
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,018
Scott: Oh, boy.

159
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,747
Rym: There's a good forum thread talking about this.

160
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:59,160
Rym: Basically, what happened is at DreamHack, big tournament.

161
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,009
Scott: Yeah, big-time gaming tournament.

162
00:09:01,432 --> 00:09:02,780
Scott: Has Hearthstone, has everything.

163
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,125
Rym: Yeah, but we're not talking about the tournament.

164
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:07,320
Rym: We're talking about the Counter-Strike tournament at the tournament.

165
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,100
Rym: The best Counter-Strike players in the world, the competitive, awesome, whatever.

166
00:09:13,181 --> 00:09:15,456
Rym: And a team was disqualified for "g".

167
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,671
Scott: Well, they quit.

168
00:09:17,943 --> 00:09:19,117
Rym: Well, they quit.

169
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:19,937
Scott: They forfeited.

170
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:27,400
Rym: They forfeited/quit, but arguably that might have been to avoid getting an official censure and all that.

171
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,460
Rym: There's a lot of drama around this, and there's even conflicting reports.

172
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,940
Rym: But the gist of it is that there was a team in the final round.

173
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,240
Scott: So they made it to the final round without doing anything shady, so they were really good.

174
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,599
Scott: They're also reportedly a bunch of assholes.

175
00:09:42,023 --> 00:09:42,990
Rym: Which I'm fine with.

176
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,300
Rym: I'm always a fan of the evil team.

177
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,199
Rym: I mean, Mighty Ducks, I'm a fan of the not-Mighty Ducks team.

178
00:09:48,742 --> 00:09:49,489
Scott: Yes, you would be.

179
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:50,679
Scott: Are you a Yankees fan, too?

180
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:54,560
Rym: I'm more of a Yankees fan than a Mets fan.

181
00:09:54,904 --> 00:09:55,840
Scott: You can go dine if you want.

182
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,662
Rym: I don't care.

183
00:09:56,682 --> 00:10:04,220
Rym: I'm actually a Tigers fan, so I either want the Tigers to win or a team near where I live that's not Boston to win.

184
00:10:05,321 --> 00:10:06,860
Scott: I like Boston more than the Yankees.

185
00:10:07,742 --> 00:10:15,440
Rym: I think I dislike Boston the most, but that might just be because I have more than once in my life experienced Red Sox fans in person.

186
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,420
Scott: Yeah, at least they don't actually say stuff to you and be drunk, unlike, say, Philadelphia fans.

187
00:10:23,862 --> 00:10:25,780
Rym: Well, I've never experienced Philadelphia fans.

188
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:32,556
Scott: Why don't you go to Philly without me and see what it's like?

189
00:10:32,576 --> 00:10:33,519
Scott: Go to an Eagles game or two.

190
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:53,338
Rym: So basically, they, in their spawn, or near their spawn, were able to jump up onto a crate that no one knew you could jump up onto due to what appears to be a transparent pixel or some little edge somewhere on this model that you could just get your character's foot just on it, your little detection box.

191
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:56,051
Scott: So these guys discovered this.

192
00:10:56,112 --> 00:10:57,120
Scott: No one else knew about it.

193
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:59,060
Scott: And they must have practiced it in secret.

194
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:03,253
Scott: And then they didn't whip it out until the final, final round.

195
00:11:03,393 --> 00:11:05,560
Scott: they started using this trick that they discovered.

196
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,920
Scott: The first half was won.

197
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,900
Scott: So the final round, first of all, this only worked because, A, the final round happened to be on this map.

198
00:11:13,103 --> 00:11:14,779
Scott: There wasn't a guarantee of that, I don't think.

199
00:11:16,001 --> 00:11:22,800
Scott: Two, they happened to be playing on the side of the map where you could access this thing in the second half of that final round.

200
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:31,180
Scott: If they had to play that side of the map in the first half of the round and they whipped out their secret, the other team would have seen it and would have been able to use it against them.

201
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,416
Rym: So the first half was won 12-3 by LDLC.

202
00:11:35,456 --> 00:11:36,280
Rym: That's one of the teams.

203
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,105
Scott: The good team?

204
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,260
Scott: The team that didn't lose?

205
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:44,460
Rym: The second half, Fnatic, which was down, the evil team, lost the pistol round.

206
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,225
Scott: So clearly, I mean, they were down, right?

207
00:11:46,265 --> 00:11:51,300
Scott: They were clearly, you know, by all accounts, they were the second best team there, right?

208
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,539
Scott: Discounting this trick that they used.

209
00:11:53,901 --> 00:11:57,957
Rym: So they lost the pistol round, and then they revealed a new trick.

210
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:58,800
Rym: I'm quoting this article.

211
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,114
Rym: It involves a boost from a counter-terrorist spawn.

212
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,400
Rym: that should be impossible.

213
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,879
Rym: Nothing to stand on, road pixel, blah blah blah blah blah.

214
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:15,700
Rym: So basically, once you get up there, you can see the entire map, including the terrorist spawn location.

215
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:16,571
Scott: Woah.

216
00:12:17,781 --> 00:12:24,814
Rym: So, quote, "Fnatic used this spot to enormous effect, turned the score around from losing 12-3 to win the

217
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:24,934
Rym: match.".

218
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:28,523
Scott: Alright.

219
00:12:29,669 --> 00:12:31,499
Rym: Nobody knew what to do about this.

220
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:40,380
Scott: So apparently in the year before, in 2013, there was a rule, like, in the tournament rules specifically, like no pixel standing or whatever, you know.

221
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,507
Scott: This year, that was not in the rules.

222
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,080
Scott: It was not in the written rules this year.

223
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,322
Rym: So you know what that'd be like?

224
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:55,120
Rym: What if the rules of football, American football, like, someone messed up and the official published rules left off something about lateral passes.

225
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:57,064
Rym: And no one noticed.

226
00:12:57,626 --> 00:13:01,219
Rym: And then in the Super Bowl, one team that noticed did it.

227
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,799
Rym: Should they win the Super Bowl?

228
00:13:03,506 --> 00:13:03,838
Scott: Yes.

229
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,325
Rym: Yes, exactly.

230
00:13:05,647 --> 00:13:06,912
Rym: They're playing by the rules.

231
00:13:06,972 --> 00:13:09,020
Rym: If no one else read the rules, tough.

232
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:12,255
Rym: If something awesome and crazy happens, it's sports.

233
00:13:12,315 --> 00:13:13,360
Rym: It's awesome and crazy.

234
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:28,796
Rym: I mean, sports is ideally about the best team winning, but at the same time, I don't care if anyone- The best team is whoever got victory by using everything they could within the rules.

235
00:13:28,856 --> 00:13:30,560
Scott: If the rules are broken, that's the game's fault.

236
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,201
Scott: Exactly.

237
00:13:31,702 --> 00:13:39,420
Rym: Now, a lot of people were saying that this was actually against the rules, but like Scott said, it turns out it technically wasn't.

238
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,251
Scott: Now, I think I agree with Scott- They didn't make a decision on whether to disqualify them or not.

239
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,980
Scott: They just forfeited and let the other team win.

240
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,938
Scott: Which, I mean, good on them for- I mean, even though they were supposedly the jerks.

241
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,368
Scott: You know, I mean, within the spirit of Counter-Strike, yeah, that other team was clearly- Wow, this article is great.

242
00:13:56,388 --> 00:13:58,000
Rym: I'm going to quote the article I was reading from.

243
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,899
Rym: "There is no doubt that Fanatics players can be unpleasant

244
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:02,040
Rym: people.".

245
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:03,678
Scott: Yeah, there you go.

246
00:14:05,722 --> 00:14:08,620
Scott: They probably play Heroes of Newerth as their second game of the Counter-Strike.

247
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,139
Rym: That's the full story of this thing, but here's my take on it.

248
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:22,500
Rym: One, there's nothing wrong with what they did, because two, the rules of a video game are the code of that video game.

249
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:34,140
Scott: Yes, unlike any real world game, like a board game or a sport, where you need to have referees or some sort of human watching and administering and enforcing rules that are just known.

250
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:44,000
Scott: A video game and a piece of software, everything that happens in the game is within that software, and so- Well, well, well, see, I already- because here's the thing.

251
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:54,960
Rym: The tournament is a structure built on top of and around the video game that has its own rules, like where people sit, what equipment you're allowed to use.

252
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,039
Scott: Sure, you can do stuff like that, sure.

253
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:11,000
Scott: But at least things that happen within the game can and should be administered and refereed totally by that software, and if the software is flawed in some way, you should fucking fix that shit before the tournament happens.

254
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:17,208
Rym: Basically, in this situation, what you could do is do it like sports ball.

255
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:26,120
Rym: There's referees, and if there's a call that's extremely complicated, they discuss it, figure out how the rules should be interpreted.

256
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:33,256
Rym: Then they immediately explain how they interpreted the rule and how it's all going to go down, and then the game continues.

257
00:15:33,276 --> 00:15:35,060
Rym: They address it immediately.

258
00:15:35,521 --> 00:15:49,498
Scott: Well, the other problem is that if you look at a mature sport, like football, basketball, hockey, baseball, no matter what happens on that field of play, there is something in the rule book that you could somehow interpret and help you out.

259
00:15:51,921 --> 00:16:06,299
Scott: The real world law, no matter what a human being does, there is some law that we can use to determine whether it's legal or illegal, but the rules for this tournament were so immature that even if you were judging, you could say, "Okay, that's what

260
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:06,700
Scott: happened.".

261
00:16:07,121 --> 00:16:11,331
Scott: You might just look through that whole rule book and be like, "I don't

262
00:16:11,351 --> 00:16:11,552
Scott: know.".

263
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:14,539
Scott: There might be nothing that you can interpret.

264
00:16:15,301 --> 00:16:16,002
Rym: Here's an example.

265
00:16:16,102 --> 00:16:21,470
Rym: What if the rule said that you're not allowed to use a single pixel glitch?

266
00:16:22,152 --> 00:16:23,373
Rym: What if that was two pixels?

267
00:16:23,614 --> 00:16:24,115
Rym: We don't know.

268
00:16:25,136 --> 00:16:26,478
Rym: Who's going to figure that out?

269
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,540
Rym: That rule is bullshit.

270
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:44,039
Rym: Maybe the rule could be something relatively vague but verbose enough to cover obvious unintended glitches to be decided at the moment of the infraction by a panel of referees based on the following guidelines.

271
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:50,780
Rym: That would have been fine, but they clearly did not have that and didn't have a real way to address this.

272
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,752
Scott: Why didn't they just say, "Hey, look, this map is obviously fucked.

273
00:16:53,772 --> 00:16:54,837
Scott: Let's play it again in a different

274
00:16:54,877 --> 00:16:55,058
Scott: map.".

275
00:16:55,781 --> 00:17:03,760
Rym: There's a million different things they could have done, but e-sports is still baby's first attempt at this.

276
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,460
Rym: They're not learning from sports ball, which probably has the most comprehensive and well-written rules in the history of sports.

277
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,425
Scott: Hockey is the best, really.

278
00:17:13,505 --> 00:17:15,089
Rym: If you didn't, you couldn't guess.

279
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:18,599
Scott: Tennis, the sport of tennis is just so perfect, it doesn't need help.

280
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:26,839
Scott: But in terms of the officiating technology, hockey, if there's any issue, they fucking call Toronto on the phone.

281
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:37,180
Scott: They're watching every hockey game in this one room, the same team of people, and they will make any kind of hard decision that the ref at the hockey game can't make is made at this one place.

282
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,764
Rym: And look, they make it immediately.

283
00:17:38,784 --> 00:17:39,706
Scott: For every game.

284
00:17:40,468 --> 00:17:41,851
Rym: And then they change the rules every year.

285
00:17:41,871 --> 00:17:45,279
Scott: You just call them on the fucking phone like, "Hey, Toronto, was that a

286
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:45,540
Scott: goal?".

287
00:17:46,324 --> 00:17:46,565
Scott: "Yeah.

288
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:46,988
Scott: All right.

289
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:47,330
Scott: Cool.

290
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,095
Scott: They said it's a goal.

291
00:17:48,115 --> 00:17:48,618
Rym: It's a

292
00:17:48,658 --> 00:17:48,840
Rym: goal.".

293
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:55,537
Rym: "Hey, Toronto, they have a goalie who's literally so fat that they shoved him into the goal and he's blocking the entire goal.

294
00:17:55,577 --> 00:17:56,359
Rym: What do we do about that?

295
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:56,559
Rym: Is that

296
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:56,700
Rym: okay?".

297
00:17:57,363 --> 00:17:57,978
Rym: And then they'll decide.

298
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:04,640
Scott: Yeah, I think part of the problem also is that a lot of the e-sports that happen around the world, there's so many different leagues.

299
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:14,740
Scott: And you look, sports, each individual sport, physical sport, didn't really become mature and big until its leagues unified into a single deal.

300
00:18:15,221 --> 00:18:23,840
Scott: The other thing is that every sport in the real world, the people who make the sport and the people who run the league are one and the same.

301
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:24,446
Rym: So thus...

302
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:31,900
Scott: The people who make Valve should be running every... All the Counter-Strike leagues should unify and they should be owned by Valve.

303
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:40,440
Rym: Or in the very least, they should have a base set of guidelines for how tournaments go that Valve administers, but then they get whatever they want.

304
00:18:40,701 --> 00:18:45,820
Scott: But if you look, the kings right now of competitive gaming is League of Legends and that is what they're doing.

305
00:18:47,062 --> 00:18:53,356
Scott: There are League of Legends tournaments besides the one, but the big ones are all run by Riot Games.

306
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:55,140
Scott: They run the show, they make the game.

307
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,333
Scott: The biggest, most important tournaments around the world, they run them.

308
00:18:58,353 --> 00:18:59,780
Scott: They got it unified, mostly.

309
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,072
Scott: And it's like, yeah, you can have the same thing with the NFL, right?

310
00:19:03,112 --> 00:19:05,000
Scott: The biggest, most important football is the NFL.

311
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,970
Scott: There are other footballs, right?

312
00:19:07,192 --> 00:19:08,599
Scott: There are other League of Legendses.

313
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,740
Scott: But the one that matters is made by the same people who run the show.

314
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,960
Rym: There is, in fact, international football and one year Japan won.

315
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,780
Scott: Well, Japan won, I think, every year until the US started participating.

316
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:20,884
Rym: Yeah.

317
00:19:21,148 --> 00:19:21,738
Rym: Because the US wasn't...

318
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,360
Scott: Basically, the team that goes to play in that is all the college football players who didn't make the NFL, like the best of those.

319
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,440
Rym: And they're better the entire rest of the world combined.

320
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,041
Scott: Yes.

321
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:32,100
Scott: Well, I mean, we're not very good at soccer.

322
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:32,924
Rym: No, we're not.

323
00:19:32,944 --> 00:19:33,670
Rym: But you know what?

324
00:19:33,691 --> 00:19:34,800
Rym: We're not the worst at soccer.

325
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:35,404
Scott: No.

326
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:35,980
Scott: Alright.

327
00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:37,999
Rym: So, yeah, you got any news?

328
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,462
Scott: I do have a news.

329
00:19:39,503 --> 00:19:43,680
Scott: So Tekken, which is, in my opinion, a not that good fighting game.

330
00:19:44,242 --> 00:19:46,960
Scott: But it's been around for a long time and it's really popular.

331
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,796
Rym: I mean, it's not as bad as Primal Rage or...

332
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,840
Scott: No, it's especially popular in Japan, right?

333
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:58,320
Scott: You know, and Tekken has always been known for not being as good as Soul Calibur.

334
00:19:59,603 --> 00:20:04,680
Scott: Besides that, it's been known because it has a lot of crazy characters in it.

335
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,680
Scott: It's like a really good arcade game because, you know, you're not really good at fighting games.

336
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,979
Scott: No one you know knows how to play Tekken.

337
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,640
Scott: So even if your friend is really good at fighting games and you're not, you can both go to a Tekken machine to mash buttons.

338
00:20:17,102 --> 00:20:18,299
Scott: And you get to pick the bear.

339
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,400
Scott: And he gets to pick the block of wood or whatever characters are in there, right?

340
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,940
Scott: It's like some, you know, samurai guy.

341
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,880
Scott: So crazy characters.

342
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,880
Scott: So you have a lot of fun just watching how the crazy characters move and interact, even if you can't play fighting games for shit.

343
00:20:34,706 --> 00:20:36,319
Scott: So Tekken 7 is coming soon.

344
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,140
Scott: And there's a new character in it that got revealed called Lucky Chloe.

345
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:48,040
Scott: And she's just sort of like a cute kind of like pink Hatsune Miku hair.

346
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,939
Scott: Well, her hair is blonde.

347
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,419
Scott: She's wearing cat ears.

348
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:57,780
Rym: She's wearing an admittedly pretty adorable like weird sort of cat shawl?

349
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,178
Rym: Sort of explain what that thing is.

350
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:00,575
Scott: It's like paws, right?

351
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:04,460
Scott: They cover whole arms, but it also goes across the back.

352
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,839
Scott: So it's like, you know what she looks like?

353
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,080
Scott: It's like a shirt that only covers the back of you and completely covers your arms and has paws at the end of it.

354
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,200
Rym: She looks like a lot of the people I see at anime conventions.

355
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,677
Scott: Yeah, it's basically anime convention girl, right?

356
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,640
Scott: Like roller derby, like knee pads and shoes, but without skates.

357
00:21:21,361 --> 00:21:27,539
Scott: And then, you know, obviously kind of cheesecake-ish because it's a Japanese game, right?

358
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,073
Scott: You can't have some covered up woman.

359
00:21:30,134 --> 00:21:30,737
Scott: That would be no.

360
00:21:31,801 --> 00:21:35,736
Scott: So apparently there are a lot of U.S.

361
00:21:35,896 --> 00:21:36,920
Scott: people who are complaining.

362
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,120
Scott: They're like, we don't want no cute girl in this game.

363
00:21:40,362 --> 00:21:41,779
Scott: It's like, why not?

364
00:21:42,744 --> 00:21:45,600
Rym: You've got to block up on the seriousness of my bear.

365
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,420
Scott: You've got a block of wood and a bear and whatever other panda and mother nonsense in here.

366
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,650
Scott: You don't want this girl because you're why?

367
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:52,771
Scott: Right.

368
00:21:54,982 --> 00:22:08,520
Scott: And it's like, I'm not sure if they're trying to be if they're being sexist by not wanting the girl or if they're being anti sexist because they don't want a perverted naked girl.

369
00:22:09,043 --> 00:22:09,870
Scott: I don't know why.

370
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,120
Rym: I don't get the impression.

371
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,760
Rym: I was just flipping through a lot of comments and a lot of people who were actually like the people are actually mad about this.

372
00:22:16,741 --> 00:22:20,320
Rym: They're not mad because that is a bad representation of a woman.

373
00:22:20,481 --> 00:22:20,964
Scott: Oh, OK.

374
00:22:21,286 --> 00:22:23,340
Rym: They're mad because it's not serious.

375
00:22:23,621 --> 00:22:32,040
Rym: And because it's like Japanese moe crap, anime crap getting into my tech, playing a Japanese playing a Japanese fighting game.

376
00:22:32,522 --> 00:22:32,864
Rym: Yeah.

377
00:22:33,266 --> 00:22:35,138
Scott: What the fuck do you think this is?

378
00:22:35,944 --> 00:22:37,219
Rym: So, yeah, those people.

379
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:46,340
Scott: So the guy who makes the game or the primary guy who's in charge of the game, Katsuhiro Harada, he said something along the lines of hello, small world.

380
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,718
Scott: I'll make muscular and skinhead character for you.

381
00:22:49,282 --> 00:22:49,988
Rym: Yeah.

382
00:22:50,028 --> 00:22:51,580
Scott: He tweeted, I'm always serious.

383
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,939
Scott: If you don't need equal, I don't release them.

384
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,753
Scott: If you need equal, I'll release.

385
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,419
Scott: That's all.

386
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,767
Scott: He commented again.

387
00:22:58,787 --> 00:23:00,580
Scott: It's your community's choice.

388
00:23:00,781 --> 00:23:02,440
Scott: I'm just hearing the demand and request.

389
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,080
Scott: Anyway, we are so busy because Tekken 7 development is not finished.

390
00:23:06,461 --> 00:23:08,340
Scott: We are working on arcade version first.

391
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,520
Scott: I think we have planning time for this issue after development.

392
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,201
Rym: You know what?

393
00:23:12,442 --> 00:23:18,120
Rym: I wish more people who are in the position to speak officially on matters would answer in the way that he answered that.

394
00:23:18,562 --> 00:23:23,380
Scott: I think what's going to be hilarious is, you know, he'll be like, OK, US version of game.

395
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:31,260
Scott: I know put in character, you know, like, OK, oh, you are all importing Japanese version because it's missing character.

396
00:23:32,282 --> 00:23:35,579
Scott: Oh, you're paying too much money because Japanese version twenty dollars more.

397
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,825
Scott: Oh, I so sad.

398
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,313
Scott: No, I'm not sad.

399
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,460
Scott: I sell many more copy.

400
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,150
Scott: Thank you.

401
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:44,480
Scott: We always give American bad version anyway.

402
00:23:44,661 --> 00:23:46,380
Scott: We continue that trend, if that what you want.

403
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:55,840
Rym: So it's interesting because we used to complain like tribes to was ruined because those guys bet for bad reasons, listen to their fans and did the things they requested.

404
00:23:56,681 --> 00:24:02,320
Rym: But they I think we always say ignore your fans or pretend to listen to them, but don't do what they ask for.

405
00:24:02,982 --> 00:24:06,600
Rym: I like this response of your morons for wanting that.

406
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,684
Rym: And here's why.

407
00:24:08,628 --> 00:24:10,175
Scott: Oh, you want me to make game worse?

408
00:24:10,276 --> 00:24:11,080
Scott: OK, I do that.

409
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:11,622
Rym: Yeah.

410
00:24:12,626 --> 00:24:13,509
Scott: Oh, what happened?

411
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:16,380
Scott: I remember last year when we reveal character, you said, you know what?

412
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:25,758
Rym: Now you want to get the first post in this article, I found just a picture of what guy would get guy.

413
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:31,159
Rym: This dumb squabble about a Tekken character makes it clear to me why this character exists in the game.

414
00:24:33,001 --> 00:24:43,720
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I don't get the the the the feeling that the people who play Tekken, right, the Tekken community is among like the high brow fighting game communities.

415
00:24:44,421 --> 00:24:44,662
Scott: Right.

416
00:24:44,682 --> 00:24:46,790
Scott: I mean, I bet the people who play Marvel vs.

417
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,858
Scott: Capcom are probably better than the people who play Tekken.

418
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:51,788
Rym: Where where's my Bushido blade?

419
00:24:51,808 --> 00:24:55,080
Scott: Yeah, that's like the net runner fighting game.

420
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:55,241
Scott: Yeah.

421
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:56,206
Rym: I want that coming back.

422
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:57,070
Scott: You make it.

423
00:24:57,834 --> 00:24:57,994
Rym: Yeah.

424
00:24:58,035 --> 00:24:58,819
Rym: I got time for that.

425
00:25:00,243 --> 00:25:02,660
Rym: Right alongside that Twitter idea that we've been throwing around.

426
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:09,888
Rym: So I don't know if you've seen all those tweets, but the idea is what you've got an RPG where your character, she does nothing more but a list of things you can do.

427
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,580
Rym: You can only ever do any of those things once ever.

428
00:25:14,261 --> 00:25:15,669
Scott: So what happens when you run out of things?

429
00:25:16,011 --> 00:25:17,460
Rym: Well, one of the things is die.

430
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,373
Scott: So eventually you just die no matter what.

431
00:25:21,178 --> 00:25:21,379
Scott: So.

432
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,873
Scott: But you could only do the things on that list and then the game be over.

433
00:25:24,913 --> 00:25:26,320
Scott: So every game be pretty much the same.

434
00:25:26,881 --> 00:25:28,589
Rym: You've got like the list, like one hundred things.

435
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,620
Rym: You play like four sessions with these characters.

436
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,253
Scott: That's your four sessions with only one hundred things.

437
00:25:33,414 --> 00:25:34,340
Rym: Maybe it depends on.

438
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:37,179
Rym: I mean, how many how many times you roll the dice and average burning will game.

439
00:25:38,081 --> 00:25:38,462
Rym: Oh, yeah.

440
00:25:39,043 --> 00:25:45,760
Rym: And it's a weird vague idea that, yeah, that that's even higher priority in the hopper than remaking Bushido blade.

441
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:55,419
Rym: So things of the day.

442
00:25:56,242 --> 00:25:58,470
Rym: This is relevant to later in the show.

443
00:25:58,971 --> 00:26:03,750
Rym: But this is just a video of Daffy Duck as a wizard in a slayers style.

444
00:26:03,991 --> 00:26:05,474
Rym: And it's pretty cool.

445
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:11,610
Rym: And you should learn the lyrics to parts of this song for future reference.

446
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:12,492
Scott: All right.

447
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,749
Scott: So this is really awesome.

448
00:26:16,691 --> 00:26:19,970
Scott: Shapeways, the people who do all the 3D printing, whatever.

449
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:20,450
Scott: Yeah.

450
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:20,651
Scott: Right.

451
00:26:21,953 --> 00:26:30,650
Scott: Partnered with this people called nervous system who, I guess, design 3D printed and or clothing fashion stuff.

452
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,294
Scott: They're like a design firm, I guess.

453
00:26:33,056 --> 00:26:38,470
Scott: And they designed a dress that you could 3D print at first.

454
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,956
Scott: They were just trying to design a bracelet.

455
00:26:39,976 --> 00:26:40,819
Scott: You could 3D print.

456
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,310
Scott: And, you know, there's a lot of problems involved with that.

457
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:43,511
Scott: Right.

458
00:26:43,531 --> 00:26:47,570
Scott: It's like, how do you get something that sort of moves and bends but is printed firmly?

459
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:53,430
Scott: And basically the idea they came up with is, well, you print the thing to be a bunch of pieces that are all linked.

460
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:55,035
Scott: Right.

461
00:26:55,055 --> 00:26:56,843
Scott: So it's small pieces that are linked together.

462
00:26:57,245 --> 00:26:58,330
Scott: So they're all individually.

463
00:26:58,471 --> 00:27:00,098
Scott: Every piece is firm plastic.

464
00:27:00,139 --> 00:27:02,349
Scott: But once you take it out, it's like, oh, OK.

465
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:09,350
Scott: So instead of just, you know, shoot aiming low and making this bracelet, they made a whole dress.

466
00:27:09,832 --> 00:27:14,110
Scott: Now, the other problem is the volume of the dress is bigger than the box of the 3D printer.

467
00:27:14,951 --> 00:27:16,176
Scott: So they had to.

468
00:27:16,337 --> 00:27:19,550
Scott: they took it in the 3D model on the computer.

469
00:27:20,091 --> 00:27:24,910
Scott: They crumpled the dress up so that it fit in the area of the 3D printer.

470
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:32,370
Scott: So it prints crumpled up and then you sort of take it out and uncrumpled it and it becomes, you know, the full size.

471
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:39,610
Scott: And despite being 100 percent solid plastic, it was actually really kind of awesome.

472
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:40,514
Scott: You just got to see this.

473
00:27:40,594 --> 00:27:43,890
Rym: fully expect to see someone wearing this at PAX South.

474
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:48,410
Rym: No, I don't think you'll see that someone's going to wear it at a convention and we'll see.

475
00:27:48,771 --> 00:27:49,053
Scott: I don't.

476
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:50,199
Scott: It's not that kind of thing.

477
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:52,190
Scott: This is like it went to the MoMA or whatever.

478
00:27:53,051 --> 00:27:55,228
Scott: It's not the kind of thing that just a normal person can get.

479
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:56,955
Rym: So there's OK.

480
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:57,722
Rym: So they didn't release.

481
00:27:57,782 --> 00:27:58,730
Rym: I haven't looked at this thing at all.

482
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:05,610
Rym: I've seen similar attempts at things, but they've always been relatively small, like a shawl kind of thing made out of plastic.

483
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,690
Scott: This is like a work of art that one person made.

484
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,218
Scott: I don't it's not something that I don't think.

485
00:28:09,238 --> 00:28:11,490
Scott: you went to Shapeways and said, hey, can you print me that dress?

486
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,177
Scott: Yeah, it might cost a bit.

487
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:15,429
Scott: And, you know, I don't know.

488
00:28:16,191 --> 00:28:25,570
Rym: Anyway, so in the meta moment, we're going to be appearing at the Penny Arcade Expo South, the inaugural in San Antonio, Texas.

489
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,402
Rym: So on Sunday, January 25th at four thirty p.m.

490
00:28:29,462 --> 00:28:31,490
Rym: in the Armadillo Theater.

491
00:28:32,617 --> 00:28:33,529
Scott: You mean an armadillo?

492
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,377
Rym: Depends on where you live.

493
00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:37,490
Scott: You are not Mexican.

494
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:41,907
Rym: We are presenting a new and updated version of Bad Games.

495
00:28:44,452 --> 00:28:48,750
Rym: If you've seen us present bad games before, you probably don't need to go to it.

496
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,749
Rym: We're hoping that people who don't know who we are go and see it.

497
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:55,150
Scott: And hopefully there'll be a lot of those people in the south.

498
00:28:55,670 --> 00:29:01,930
Rym: And otherwise, we're pretty much just going to eat barbecue, play tabletop games and make fun of the south.

499
00:29:03,017 --> 00:29:03,689
Scott: And the Tejas.

500
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:04,907
Rym: Yeah, Texas.

501
00:29:05,936 --> 00:29:06,227
Scott: Let's play.

502
00:29:07,677 --> 00:29:08,130
Scott: Let's play.

503
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,530
Rym: You're giving me shit for Armadillo and you say Tejas.

504
00:29:10,712 --> 00:29:12,169
Scott: Well, you know, the titans that live there.

505
00:29:12,671 --> 00:29:14,630
Rym: Yeah, here's coyotes out in that territory.

506
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,910
Scott: We should bring and play Outlaw in Tejas.

507
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:21,469
Rym: Actually, we should.

508
00:29:22,411 --> 00:29:29,070
Rym: Actually, we should set it up on a laptop with two controllers and video people playing it and get their reactions and then run a tournament.

509
00:29:29,637 --> 00:29:30,190
Scott: Outlaw tournament.

510
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,969
Rym: Yeah, I had spare time.

511
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,050
Scott: As it's properly known, Pretzel Cowboy.

512
00:29:35,636 --> 00:29:38,430
Rym: Yeah, if I'm going to remake a video game, that's what I'm remaking first.

513
00:29:38,552 --> 00:29:39,048
Scott: Pretzel Cowboy.

514
00:29:40,711 --> 00:29:42,390
Rym: Otherwise, the Book Club book is Watership Down.

515
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:43,528
Rym: I read it a long time ago.

516
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:44,247
Rym: You should read it.

517
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:44,903
Rym: It's an awesome book.

518
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:47,889
Scott: Other meta things.

519
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,790
Scott: Come find us on the internet.

520
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:53,670
Scott: I mean, I'm pretty sure if you found this podcast and you're listening right now, you've already found us on the internet.

521
00:29:53,670 --> 00:30:04,750
Rym: But at the same time, many people who follow us on YouTube did not realize somehow that we obviously think Gamergate is stupid like anyone who's smart.

522
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:10,730
Rym: And they were shocked when they realized through YouTube that that was our opinion.

523
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:16,170
Rym: Because they only followed us on YouTube and it literally never interacted with us in any other way.

524
00:30:16,792 --> 00:30:18,910
Rym: So you should interact with us in multiple ways.

525
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:23,870
Rym: That way you can find out what important thing we think that you will be offended by and leave.

526
00:30:25,051 --> 00:30:29,850
Scott: Yeah, you should also internet more because internetting is what cool people like us do.

527
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,590
Scott: If you internet enough, you won't need to listen to this show.

528
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:45,430
Rym: I've also uploaded a whole bunch of video from PAX Australia, which was one of the rare times outside of Kineticons and weird conventions where one of us gave a lecture without the other one.

529
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:46,007
Rym: It was just me.

530
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,390
Rym: Because Scott didn't want to fly to Australia again.

531
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:52,390
Scott: We also recorded another episode of GeekNights presents you tennis.

532
00:30:52,431 --> 00:30:53,029
Rym: Yeah, we did.

533
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,208
Scott: Upload that.

534
00:30:54,810 --> 00:31:00,710
Rym: I gotta edit it together and do stuff to it to hide the fact that because it's in 4K, you can literally see my pores.

535
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,149
Scott: Alright, well, do that.

536
00:31:02,372 --> 00:31:04,190
Rym: Yeah, but it'll be up soon.

537
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,667
Rym: As soon as I get a chance to put it up.

538
00:31:06,611 --> 00:31:09,470
Rym: And the last meta thing, just because people asked me a lot about this last year.

539
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,730
Rym: I'm going to go skiing at Hunter Mountain on Saturday.

540
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:16,069
Rym: If you want to go meet me and hang out and go skiing, let me know.

541
00:31:16,512 --> 00:31:17,509
Rym: I'm going to be there all day.

542
00:31:17,991 --> 00:31:23,409
Scott: I don't think I'm doing anything this weekend, but if anyone wants to play Netrunner in New York, I mean, I probably already played Netrunner with you.

543
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,759
Rym: So, Wizard.

544
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,171
Rym: The Wizard.

545
00:31:31,901 --> 00:31:36,480
Rym: Scott and I met two awesome, smart people at the previous PAX Australia.

546
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,720
Scott: The first PAX Australia.

547
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,964
Rym: Yes, we went to it.

548
00:31:39,245 --> 00:31:42,679
Rym: We were walking around and we were like, "We gotta find some smart people to play a game

549
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:42,859
Rym: with.".

550
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:46,378
Rym: We saw two people and they were looking for a game and we were like, "Hey, you want to play a

551
00:31:46,418 --> 00:31:46,599
Rym: game?".

552
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,560
Rym: And one thing led to another.

553
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,399
Scott: We played Hanavi.

554
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:53,120
Rym: We played Hanavi, which is Smart Person Detector Alpha.

555
00:31:53,504 --> 00:31:53,739
Scott: Yep.

556
00:31:54,321 --> 00:31:55,160
Rym: And they were smart.

557
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,559
Scott: Yep, the Smart Person Detector went bing, bing, bing.

558
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,174
Rym: Yep.

559
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,920
Scott: It's almost like a dowsing rod, but it works.

560
00:32:00,362 --> 00:32:07,140
Rym: So, I have to give props to them because Jess and Bain, these two people who were smart and we hung out with them, I hung out with them again at the next PAX OZ.

561
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:12,040
Rym: Because, like we do, we form PAX-specific posses in every region of the world where there's a PAX.

562
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:18,139
Rym: And they brought out a game and, as is the Rym and Scott style, I did what we always do.

563
00:32:19,663 --> 00:32:21,798
Rym: Really, I've never heard of this game and you want me to play it?

564
00:32:22,381 --> 00:32:24,059
Rym: Watch how enthused I am.

565
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,800
Rym: Watch me try to avoid learning this game because I actually just want to play this game that I brought.

566
00:32:29,845 --> 00:32:33,200
Rym: And I played Wizard, and it was great.

567
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,230
Scott: Wizard.

568
00:32:35,082 --> 00:32:37,040
Scott: So, Wizard is actually a mad old game.

569
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,220
Scott: It's published in 1984.

570
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,899
Scott: It is two years younger than us.

571
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:42,639
Rym: Yep.

572
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:53,240
Scott: It received a nomination for the 2011 Netherlands Spelenpriz, which I guess is the Netherlands Game Prize.

573
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,079
Rym: Nederlander das Spiel des Jahrs.

574
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,082
Scott: Right, basically, in 2011.

575
00:32:57,082 --> 00:32:59,320
Scott: So, it took that long for the game to be recognized.

576
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,440
Rym: It wasn't even published commercially until like 1986.

577
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:02,596
Scott: Right.

578
00:33:03,802 --> 00:33:07,100
Scott: And then we only discovered it in 2014.

579
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:12,820
Scott: So, this game is like a game that I guess has just been sitting in the dark and suddenly popped out of nowhere.

580
00:33:13,622 --> 00:33:15,739
Scott: It's designed by a guy named Ken Fisher.

581
00:33:16,171 --> 00:33:16,340
Scott: Yeah.

582
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,979
Scott: Who I never heard of, but I'm going to look him up.

583
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:23,600
Scott: Alright, in his board game geek picture, he has a hood on that has a gold lining.

584
00:33:25,864 --> 00:33:28,459
Scott: I think Wizard is the only thing that he makes.

585
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,852
Scott: It's WizardCards.com.

586
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,179
Scott: Well, you know what, guy?

587
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:32,820
Scott: It's an official website.

588
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,300
Rym: If you've only ever made one game, you're batting a thousand.

589
00:33:36,428 --> 00:33:36,637
Scott: Oh, no.

590
00:33:37,701 --> 00:33:41,260
Scott: He's made Isaac Asimov's super quiz one, two, and three.

591
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,379
Rym: Okay, I think your batting average is dropping.

592
00:33:43,781 --> 00:33:45,760
Scott: Or maybe this is just part of his wish.

593
00:33:45,922 --> 00:33:46,255
Scott: I don't know.

594
00:33:47,122 --> 00:33:47,778
Rym: Alright, alright.

595
00:33:49,242 --> 00:33:50,559
Scott: Wizard's the only thing we care about.

596
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,800
Scott: Sorry, Ken Fisher.

597
00:33:52,382 --> 00:33:53,520
Rym: Wizard is interesting.

598
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:56,119
Scott: He actually has the username Wizard on BoardGameGeek.

599
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:56,629
Scott: Wow.

600
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:57,273
Scott: Yeah.

601
00:33:59,243 --> 00:34:01,340
Rym: So, remember our review of Pendante.

602
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:08,840
Rym: Pendante is like if poker were designed today to be fun, it's Pendante.

603
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:14,480
Scott: It's like they take poker and you soup it up with some Euro game skills and some modern design.

604
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,659
Rym: And write rules to it like it's a modern game and all that.

605
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,799
Scott: And put some theme on there.

606
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:18,112
Rym: Yeah.

607
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:18,715
Rym: And you know what?

608
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:24,699
Rym: Pendante gives you 90 percent of the fun of actual poker without any of the tedium of actual poker.

609
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:31,438
Scott: So, Wizard is, well, Pendante is to poker as Wizard is to wist.

610
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:33,018
Scott: Yes.

611
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,520
Scott: Slash heart, slash huker, slash every trick-taking.

612
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:36,739
Rym: Trick-taking games.

613
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:42,239
Rym: Wizard is just a Trump food suit following trick-taking game.

614
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:48,139
Scott: Now, most people who are in the board game nerd community who are looking to play a trick-taking game go straight to teach you.

615
00:34:48,585 --> 00:34:49,297
Scott: I have teach you.

616
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,456
Scott: I play teach you.

617
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:51,998
Scott: Teach you is not good.

618
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:52,920
Rym: Teach you is not.

619
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,549
Scott: I would rather play hearts than play.

620
00:34:54,589 --> 00:34:58,079
Scott: teach you, but I would rather play Wizard than any other trick-taking game I've ever seen.

621
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,099
Rym: Well, it depends.

622
00:34:59,461 --> 00:35:00,498
Scott: And Bridge is for old people.

623
00:35:01,961 --> 00:35:07,940
Rym: So, I grew up in the Midwest where everyone plays trick-taking games.

624
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,140
Rym: Everyone.

625
00:35:09,461 --> 00:35:11,140
Rym: Everyone knows those kinds of games.

626
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,000
Rym: You grow up playing Euchre and Wist and Hearts and P-Nuckle and all these kinds of games.

627
00:35:15,929 --> 00:35:16,460
Rym: I hate Bridge.

628
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,360
Rym: I hate P-Nuckle.

629
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:23,280
Rym: I like Euchre, but if you play Euchre enough, it's a solved game that comes down to cheating.

630
00:35:24,702 --> 00:35:26,320
Rym: Hearts is a fantastic game.

631
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,019
Scott: Hearts is the best.

632
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:28,340
Rym: I fucking love Hearts.

633
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,059
Rym: I will play Hearts almost any time.

634
00:35:30,221 --> 00:35:30,760
Scott: Hearts is great.

635
00:35:31,325 --> 00:35:31,438
Rym: Yes.

636
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:40,420
Rym: But, much like how when we taught Pen Dante, especially when I tried to teach Pen Dante to a bunch of our friends, I learned that a lot of our friends had never played poker.

637
00:35:41,603 --> 00:35:43,559
Rym: They didn't know what a flush was.

638
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,079
Scott: They knew what a flush was.

639
00:35:45,201 --> 00:35:47,060
Rym: They were extra surprised by a flush.

640
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:47,593
Scott: Yup.

641
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,080
Rym: And, this was the same deal.

642
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:57,080
Rym: It was interesting to read the rules to trick-taking because I had never in my life thought about the rules to trick-taking.

643
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:01,899
Scott: Yeah, if I had to teach him this game, I would say, "Look, all you have to do in this game is...".

644
00:36:02,764 --> 00:36:03,200
Rym: Trick-taking.

645
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,119
Scott: It's trick-taking game.

646
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,800
Scott: Trump is the top card that gets revealed from the deck after we deal the cards.

647
00:36:08,261 --> 00:36:08,540
Rym: You know what?

648
00:36:08,781 --> 00:36:09,918
Rym: What I'll do right now for you guys?

649
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:13,900
Rym: I'm going to teach you the entire game the way I would teach it to Scott.

650
00:36:14,126 --> 00:36:14,580
Scott: All right.

651
00:36:14,861 --> 00:36:15,840
Scott: But, I already know how to play.

652
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,320
Scott: Exactly.

653
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,219
Rym: This is for the listener.

654
00:36:18,621 --> 00:36:26,179
Rym: So, this is basically just a trick-taking game, but the way you're going to do it is you bid how many tricks you're going to take, and then you play a hand of one.

655
00:36:27,181 --> 00:36:29,799
Rym: Then, you bid how many tricks you're going to take, and you play a hand of two.

656
00:36:30,383 --> 00:36:31,259
Rym: Then, a hand of three.

657
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:36,919
Scott: So, obviously, in the hand of one, I would only bid one or zero because it would be impossible for me to take two tricks.

658
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:37,376
Rym: Yup.

659
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,480
Scott: Am I allowed to bid two even though there's only one trick to take?

660
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:50,096
Rym: Well, yes, but that's going to fuck you because the scoring is you get one point for every trick you take if you bid the correct number, and then you get two points because you bid correctly.

661
00:36:50,482 --> 00:36:52,140
Rym: So, if I bid one, I get one.

662
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:52,998
Rym: I get three points.

663
00:36:53,340 --> 00:37:03,758
Scott: So, you want to take more tricks and bid correctly, but if bidding correctly is more important because if you're even one off from the correct bid, you lose a point for every one you're off by.

664
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,460
Rym: So, if I bid eight and I take nine or seven, I lose a point.

665
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:12,079
Scott: But if I bid one and take one and you bid five and take five, you're doing way better than me.

666
00:37:12,383 --> 00:37:12,598
Rym: Exactly.

667
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,200
Rym: That way, you can't just be like zero, zero, always taking zero, ducking under.

668
00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:21,679
Scott: Even if you always take zero, you're going to play a trump card at some point because you're going to have it in your hand and you're going to take one.

669
00:37:21,861 --> 00:37:22,580
Scott: Maybe, maybe not.

670
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,420
Scott: And then you're going to be off.

671
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,020
Rym: Yeah, because someone else will play the fucking A's and you just duck your trump under.

672
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,598
Rym: That is fine.

673
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:31,759
Rym: So, that's the game with one trick to it.

674
00:37:32,342 --> 00:37:33,219
Scott: All three tricks.

675
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:34,758
Rym: Three tricks?

676
00:37:34,942 --> 00:37:35,028
Rym: Yeah.

677
00:37:35,381 --> 00:37:38,580
Rym: I was just going to say there are super trump weird cards.

678
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,500
Scott: Oh, okay.

679
00:37:39,723 --> 00:37:39,817
Rym: Yeah.

680
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,720
Rym: There's only four of each type.

681
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,517
Rym: There are jesters and there are wizards.

682
00:37:47,702 --> 00:37:48,900
Scott: I didn't, I don't know any jesters.

683
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,760
Rym: So, the problem is the game is in German, at least the copy of it that we got.

684
00:37:54,581 --> 00:38:01,160
Rym: So, it's Zauberers and Nars, Zs and Ns because that's not in any way visually confusing.

685
00:38:01,381 --> 00:38:03,799
Scott: Yeah, because a Z is just a sideways N.

686
00:38:03,983 --> 00:38:04,298
Rym: Yes.

687
00:38:06,081 --> 00:38:07,740
Rym: Well, I mean six and nine upside down.

688
00:38:07,962 --> 00:38:08,260
Rym: So, anyway.

689
00:38:09,202 --> 00:38:11,500
Scott: That's why you draw a line on one side of it so you know.

690
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,980
Rym: A wizard is, it is trump and it is infinity.

691
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:18,979
Rym: So, it always wins the trick.

692
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,619
Scott: What if two people play wizards at the same hand?

693
00:38:21,961 --> 00:38:26,460
Rym: If multiple wizards are played, whichever wizard was placed first wins the trick.

694
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:33,120
Scott: So, if I get the first play because I took the last trick and I play a wizard, I get the next trick and everyone else can dump a card?

695
00:38:33,268 --> 00:38:33,460
Scott: Yes.

696
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,940
Rym: So, if you lead a wizard.

697
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,100
Scott: And clear out a suit or whatever?

698
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,200
Rym: There is no suit for that hand.

699
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,480
Scott: So, wouldn't I want to play my wizards later in the round?

700
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,340
Scott: Because I mean I'm going to take a trick with a wizard anyway.

701
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:42,760
Scott: Possibly.

702
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:46,380
Scott: So, if I play it later in the round, I'm basically preventing people from dumping suit early.

703
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:53,200
Rym: But you don't want to be in a situation where you don't have the lead anymore and then the last three people all lead wizard and then your fourth wizard is just fucked.

704
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:53,763
Scott: Ah.

705
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,699
Rym: That could happen.

706
00:38:55,181 --> 00:38:58,820
Rym: Or you might accidentally take a trick in the mid and now you don't want to take a trick with that wizard.

707
00:38:59,680 --> 00:38:59,723
Rym: Ah.

708
00:39:00,121 --> 00:39:01,320
Rym: And then the jesters.

709
00:39:01,863 --> 00:39:04,720
Rym: They are negative infinity and are not Trump.

710
00:39:05,741 --> 00:39:06,418
Rym: They have no suits.

711
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:11,197
Scott: So, obviously, even if two people play gnar, one of the other players is going to take the trick.

712
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,020
Scott: But what if all players play gnar?

713
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,120
Rym: Whoever led that gnar gets fucked.

714
00:39:15,744 --> 00:39:16,239
Rym: Oh no.

715
00:39:17,261 --> 00:39:18,420
Rym: I've never seen it happen.

716
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,558
Scott: I doubt that would ever happen.

717
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,200
Rym: The day it happens, I'm going to yell and scream because it's just going to be so beautiful.

718
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,016
Scott: Well, so it says here on board game you can play with three to six players but there's only four gnars.

719
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,780
Scott: So, it can only happen with three or four players.

720
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,540
Scott: It can only happen with four or fewer players.

721
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,720
Rym: I think the game is best with four players, like all trick taking games are.

722
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,914
Scott: If you play with five or six, I mean, obviously, the all wizard or all gnar situation can't happen.

723
00:39:40,081 --> 00:39:45,940
Rym: So, if a gnar is led, then the next player to play sets the suit for the trick.

724
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:46,385
Scott: Ah.

725
00:39:46,943 --> 00:39:47,115
Scott: Okay.

726
00:39:47,681 --> 00:39:51,460
Rym: So, that's pretty much the whole game.

727
00:39:52,340 --> 00:40:00,940
Rym: Now, if you don't know, if that doesn't mean anything to you, the way trick taking games work, fundamentally, one, you should go back and listen to our episode on hearts.

728
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,920
Scott: Everyone who is in the game has a hand of cards.

729
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:04,360
Rym: Yes.

730
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,660
Scott: Someone goes first.

731
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,200
Scott: That person plays a card.

732
00:40:07,402 --> 00:40:08,059
Scott: Any of the cards.

733
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,480
Scott: Cards have a suit and a value.

734
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,720
Rym: So, whatever suit was played is now the suit for that hand, that trick.

735
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,940
Scott: So, the next person now has to play one card from their hand.

736
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:22,080
Scott: If they have a card matching the suit of the already played card, they must follow suit.

737
00:40:22,201 --> 00:40:23,940
Scott: That's why you ever heard the phrase follow suit?

738
00:40:24,283 --> 00:40:25,079
Scott: That's what that means.

739
00:40:25,601 --> 00:40:32,340
Scott: So, if Rym goes first and he plays a spade, and I have a spade in my hand, I must play a spade.

740
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:38,679
Scott: I may not play one of the other cards in my hand and people, if I cheat, people can figure it out easily and ruin me.

741
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,040
Scott: Pointing out, so, I have to play a spade.

742
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:45,540
Scott: If I don't have a spade, I may play any of the other cards in my hand.

743
00:40:45,702 --> 00:40:46,079
Rym: Exactly.

744
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:50,020
Rym: So, one suit will be determined by some fashion.

745
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:53,340
Rym: In some games, players can kind of decide through a process.

746
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,960
Rym: In this game and in many games, it's just random.

747
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,159
Rym: And not all trick-taking games have this.

748
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,640
Rym: But one suit will be determined to be Trump.

749
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:05,540
Rym: That suit will trump any other suits.

750
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:13,920
Rym: So, if I played the ten and Scott played the four and someone else played the two of the suit that was the trick, then I would get it.

751
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,678
Rym: I have the highest number.

752
00:41:15,661 --> 00:41:21,980
Scott: And if someone else plays a card from some other suit because they didn't have the appropriate suit in hand, they don't get to take the trick.

753
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:26,480
Scott: Because it's only, you have to follow suit for your card to count as taking the trick.

754
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,220
Rym: But a two of Trump beats the highest number of non-Trump.

755
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:30,597
Scott: Right.

756
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:36,660
Scott: So, it's like if I want to take tricks, a lot of them, I want to have a lot of Trump cards in my hand and dump a suit.

757
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,559
Scott: So, let's say I get rid of all the spades in my hand.

758
00:41:38,984 --> 00:41:40,220
Scott: But I have a bunch of Trump cards.

759
00:41:40,502 --> 00:41:40,838
Scott: Hearts are Trump.

760
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:43,880
Scott: Then other people still have a ton of spades.

761
00:41:44,203 --> 00:41:44,878
Scott: And they play them.

762
00:41:45,561 --> 00:41:48,360
Scott: And on my turn, I don't have to play a spade because I don't have one.

763
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,140
Scott: So, I play my heart cards that are Trump.

764
00:41:50,461 --> 00:41:51,719
Scott: And I get to take those tricks.

765
00:41:51,861 --> 00:41:53,760
Scott: Regardless of the value of my heart cards.

766
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:55,060
Scott: Unless someone else.

767
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:59,079
Scott: As long as someone else also ran out of spades and plays heart cards that are higher value than mine.

768
00:41:59,611 --> 00:41:59,800
Scott: Right.

769
00:42:00,283 --> 00:42:01,500
Scott: So, because the hearts are the Trump.

770
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,440
Scott: If someone just starts the hand with the hearts, well.

771
00:42:04,641 --> 00:42:05,640
Rym: That's awesome sometimes.

772
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,060
Scott: But you have to follow suit.

773
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,060
Scott: You have to follow suit.

774
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:09,979
Rym: So, in like a state, like in hearts.

775
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,320
Rym: Well, the hearts is an example.

776
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:16,172
Rym: So, in Euchre, if I play, Euchre's not a good example because then I have to explain fucking, whatever.

777
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,620
Rym: So, in Wist, if I play the ace of Trump.

778
00:42:22,061 --> 00:42:22,738
Rym: And I lead that.

779
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,400
Rym: And Scott only has a king of the Trump suit.

780
00:42:27,001 --> 00:42:28,840
Rym: He's got to just throw it down and lose it.

781
00:42:28,961 --> 00:42:29,700
Scott: And he doesn't do anything.

782
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,880
Scott: Even though that is an extremely powerful card.

783
00:42:32,105 --> 00:42:32,191
Scott: Yeah.

784
00:42:32,642 --> 00:42:34,159
Scott: I was forced to play it and lose it.

785
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:40,559
Rym: So, the final rub in Wizard is that you may play a Gnar or a Zauber-er.

786
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:43,780
Rym: Regardless of following suit at any time.

787
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,019
Rym: You can always play one.

788
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:48,700
Scott: So, even if I can follow suit, I can Wizard or Gnar instead.

789
00:42:49,161 --> 00:42:53,780
Scott: So, if I was in a situation like Rym just said where I have a really powerful card.

790
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,237
Scott: But I'm going to be forced to lose it.

791
00:42:55,801 --> 00:42:59,520
Scott: I can just Gnar or Wizard instead and keep that powerful card in my hand.

792
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,260
Scott: And then play it later and get the value from it.

793
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,000
Rym: So, the game is great.

794
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:14,853
Rym: You can play it with a normal deck of cards as long as you have eight cards beyond the deck of cards that can be labeled Zauber-er and Gnar.

795
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:22,180
Scott: So, usually if you buy a deck of playing cards at the drug store, it's going to have two learn to play cards and two jokers.

796
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:31,580
Scott: You might need to get two decks of cards at the same back and take the aces and doodle on them and write Zauber-er and then take some deuces and write Gnar on them or something.

797
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,459
Rym: Do something like that.

798
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,179
Rym: Or you can just buy.

799
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,780
Rym: There's a lot of people that make pre-made decks.

800
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,958
Rym: The one we bought has the- The official one?

801
00:43:38,261 --> 00:43:41,280
Rym: Has the best worst art ever.

802
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:47,960
Scott: Yeah, so the artist is Franz Vowinkel and the art is simultaneously good and bad.

803
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,440
Scott: I mean, it's not the worst art I've seen.

804
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,500
Scott: It's not Sentinels of the Multiverse, which looks like a child drew it.

805
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,260
Scott: Sorry, whoever did that, but yeah, it's bad.

806
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:59,460
Rym: The art's special and if you play with this deck, your players will comment on the art.

807
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,300
Scott: Yeah, it's noteworthy, which I think is actually a positive, right?

808
00:44:03,421 --> 00:44:06,380
Scott: It doesn't really matter for the game, you know, a lot.

809
00:44:06,822 --> 00:44:09,195
Scott: This is the way it does for a collectible or living game.

810
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,420
Rym: Oh my god, I just realized what it says on the back.

811
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:18,780
Rym: Game contents, 60 character cards, one score pad of truth, one set of instructions.

812
00:44:19,481 --> 00:44:21,460
Rym: I love how it's not even branded as a card game.

813
00:44:21,862 --> 00:44:23,280
Rym: It's the character cards.

814
00:44:23,901 --> 00:44:28,740
Rym: It has this whole story and the story in the game is amazingly succinct.

815
00:44:30,145 --> 00:44:30,720
Scott: What's the story?

816
00:44:30,941 --> 00:44:37,800
Rym: The story is we unearthed Stonehenge and found the game that Wizards used to play back when Wizards existed.

817
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:38,357
Scott: Nice.

818
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,176
Rym: Here are the rules.

819
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,011
Scott: Dude, that sounds true to me.

820
00:44:42,031 --> 00:44:43,338
Scott: I believe it.

821
00:44:45,441 --> 00:44:50,939
Rym: So, if you have never played a trick-taking game ever, get this game and play it.

822
00:44:51,700 --> 00:45:06,779
Scott: It says on Board Game Geek that Wizard originated from Oh Hell or also known as Up and Down the River, which are played with a standard deck of 52 cards with a proprietary 60 card deck comprising a standard deck plus four wizards and four jesters in the first hand, one card and so on and so on.

823
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:16,399
Scott: So apparently there was another trick-taking game called Oh Hell, also known as Up and Down the River, which was the game that came before Wizard but did not have the wizards and Nars in it.

824
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:17,060
Rym: Yep.

825
00:45:17,623 --> 00:45:21,740
Rym: But then you're getting close to Wist or Gops or all those other kinds of games.

826
00:45:22,682 --> 00:45:28,180
Rym: But seriously, if you've never played a trick-taking game, get Wizard somehow.

827
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:36,680
Rym: And this is the best way to learn trick-taking games, to learn to get good at them, and then it'll be really easy to play Hearts and Euchre and all these other kinds of games.

828
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,820
Scott: I think you should just play Hearts first on your Windows PC.

829
00:45:40,084 --> 00:45:41,280
Rym: Well, so it's tricky because...

830
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,118
Scott: Or Yahoo Games.

831
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,180
Rym: What's interesting is that...

832
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:45,480
Scott: And then you'll be able to play Wizard very easily.

833
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:50,640
Rym: Hearts has the... Hearts teaches you de-suiting and ducking and all those kinds of strategies.

834
00:45:50,721 --> 00:45:52,097
Scott: Very important things to know for Wizard.

835
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,620
Rym: But Hearts has no Trump, and Hearts has the card passing mechanics.

836
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,899
Scott: Well, Hearts are Trump in Hearts.

837
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,198
Rym: Well, they're not Trump.

838
00:45:59,123 --> 00:45:59,739
Scott: Uh, sorta.

839
00:46:00,002 --> 00:46:00,774
Rym: No, they're not Trump.

840
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,160
Scott: They're like reverse Trump.

841
00:46:02,441 --> 00:46:03,038
Scott: No, they're not.

842
00:46:03,686 --> 00:46:04,079
Scott: They are.

843
00:46:04,323 --> 00:46:04,820
Rym: No, they're not.

844
00:46:05,141 --> 00:46:08,100
Rym: They don't count extra for taking a suit.

845
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,800
Rym: No, but they're the... Trump only means it lets you take a trick that you wouldn't otherwise take.

846
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:13,318
Scott: Sure.

847
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:13,900
Scott: Doesn't mean anything else.

848
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:18,720
Scott: But they're the special suit in that you don't... Yes, Trump does mean the special suit.

849
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:19,900
Rym: They're the point suit.

850
00:46:20,142 --> 00:46:21,840
Rym: Don't fuck with me on trick-taking games.

851
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:22,698
Rym: I grew up in Michigan.

852
00:46:23,202 --> 00:46:24,660
Scott: You're being a pedantic nonsense.

853
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,040
Rym: If you called that Trump among anyone who plays these games, they would laugh you out of the room.

854
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:33,360
Scott: You'll still be able to easily understand the concepts of Wizard after playing Hearts.

855
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:38,480
Rym: Scott, other... In America, other than one teaching game, I'm fucking undefeated at Wizards.

856
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,299
Rym: Don't you even.

857
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:40,298
Rym: Don't you even.

858
00:46:42,223 --> 00:46:46,100
Rym: So... But yeah, Hearts and Euchre are the two, like, arctic, typical games.

859
00:46:46,361 --> 00:46:48,699
Rym: I'd say Wist, but no one fucking actually plays Wist.

860
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:49,760
Scott: Well, people did.

861
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,920
Rym: No, yeah, no one modern plays Wist.

862
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:55,680
Rym: And also, Euchre is basically just, like, Wist with a tiny deck.

863
00:46:56,142 --> 00:47:02,540
Rym: So it's kind of like... It's almost like... Euchre is almost to Wist what pandanta is to poker as well, in a sense.

864
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:03,419
Scott: There's also Bridge.

865
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,579
Rym: Yeah, I hate Bridge.

866
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,540
Rym: But to articulate why requires...

867
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:08,800
Scott: Bridge is a big deal, though.

868
00:47:08,921 --> 00:47:09,636
Rym: I know it is.

869
00:47:10,241 --> 00:47:12,680
Rym: I respect Bridge, but I don't like playing Bridge.

870
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,779
Rym: But... So, let's talk about Wizard.

871
00:47:16,785 --> 00:47:17,478
Rym: Because just play it.

872
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,532
Rym: But strategy-wise...

873
00:47:19,181 --> 00:47:20,040
Scott: Oh, strategy-wise.

874
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:24,580
Rym: This is a good game with a very high skill cap.

875
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:26,337
Scott: So I think the thing is...

876
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:30,440
Rym: Playing this with people with noobs is like beating babies to death.

877
00:47:30,782 --> 00:47:31,560
Rym: It's just... Right.

878
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:35,580
Scott: So you look at your hand and you say, "How many tricks can I possibly take with this

879
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:35,889
Scott: hand?".

880
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:39,940
Scott: And the thing is, well, you could... You might have a hand.

881
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:40,599
Scott: It's got, like, Wizard.

882
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,840
Scott: Okay, I gotta bet at least one.

883
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:42,320
Scott: I got a Wizard.

884
00:47:42,563 --> 00:47:42,654
Scott: Yep.

885
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,800
Scott: Then I got, like, two high trump cards.

886
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:46,740
Rym: Well, I should probably bet... Scott, I saw a game.

887
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:50,420
Rym: In the first round, two Wizards were in people's hands.

888
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:50,933
Scott: Yep.

889
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:52,200
Rym: So shit happens.

890
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:52,820
Scott: Exactly.

891
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:56,120
Scott: So, let's say it's the hand of five.

892
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,240
Scott: You've got a Wizard, two high trumps, and two mech cards.

893
00:48:00,541 --> 00:48:01,879
Rym: Are those mech cards the same suit?

894
00:48:03,511 --> 00:48:03,699
Scott: Maybe.

895
00:48:04,064 --> 00:48:04,619
Scott: Yeah, why not?

896
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:08,780
Rym: If they're the same suit, I'm definitely bidding fucking four.

897
00:48:09,883 --> 00:48:10,719
Scott: How are you gonna get four?

898
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:14,660
Rym: Because I'm gonna control with the Wizard, lead my other stuff.

899
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:18,320
Rym: The odds of other trump being out in the five hand, probably pretty low.

900
00:48:18,741 --> 00:48:21,460
Scott: You're basically counting that one of those mech cards will be able to take a trick.

901
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,239
Rym: Because I'll be leading it toward the end.

902
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:35,520
Rym: And because they're mech, if someone else fucks me somehow and takes control, I'll probably be able to use those trump to get control back pretty easily because the odds of the highest trump being in the game are pretty low.

903
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,839
Rym: And two, because I'm de-suited, there's a decent chance I can use one of those trump to get back in right away.

904
00:48:40,061 --> 00:48:50,220
Scott: Yeah, I would just bet three because even if I am able to take one of the tricks with one of those mech cards, right, I know that other people all have five cards in the hand.

905
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:53,600
Scott: Someone's gonna fuck me when I play one of my high trumps with a Wizard or some shit.

906
00:48:54,280 --> 00:49:01,440
Scott: So I basically can't, those two, those, you know, the advantage I can do if I try to take the tricks versus the someone's gonna fuck me cancel out.

907
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:02,417
Scott: So I go three.

908
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,240
Rym: Here's the real thing.

909
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:08,000
Rym: My heuristic there, which was similar to yours, is just based on your hand.

910
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:12,940
Rym: Which is how like in the hearts, your hand is the only real core direction.

911
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,520
Scott: You don't get to see anyone else's hand.

912
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,159
Scott: That's all you got to go.

913
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:15,820
Rym: There's no bidding.

914
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:20,140
Rym: But in Wizard, players openly bid on how many tricks they're going to take in turn order.

915
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,860
Scott: So depending on who bids first and what they've bid, it's the hand of five.

916
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,720
Scott: The first player, let's say Rym goes, he has the hand we just discussed.

917
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,660
Rym: If I'm bidding first, I would bid three.

918
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:29,080
Scott: All right.

919
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,759
Scott: So he going first, he bids three.

920
00:49:31,681 --> 00:49:37,840
Scott: If he's correct, that means among the three other players, only two people should take the tricks.

921
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,219
Scott: Meanwhile, I'm sitting to the left of Rym.

922
00:49:39,646 --> 00:49:40,319
Scott: I look at my hand.

923
00:49:40,663 --> 00:49:41,840
Scott: It's ridiculous luck day.

924
00:49:41,962 --> 00:49:42,760
Scott: I have two wizards.

925
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,339
Scott: So, but all the other cards in my hand are like twos.

926
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,380
Rym: But you know that I'm really confident because I bid three not knowing anyone else's bid.

927
00:49:50,902 --> 00:49:51,880
Scott: But I'm bidding two.

928
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:52,679
Scott: I got two wizards.

929
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:57,780
Rym: So the other two people either know they're not taking shit, are dumb and bid anyway.

930
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:01,020
Scott: So now it's a round of five and five people have already bid.

931
00:50:01,643 --> 00:50:03,299
Scott: Two people have bid on all five tricks.

932
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,219
Scott: The other guy's holding like a really high trump card.

933
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:07,013
Scott: He bids one.

934
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,779
Scott: And the other person's got some high trump cards too.

935
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:11,179
Scott: They bid one or two.

936
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,540
Rym: Now this is where the game gets interesting.

937
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:17,997
Scott: So now the people have bid a total of like seven or eight tricks out of only five available tricks.

938
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,340
Scott: Someone's wrong.

939
00:50:20,162 --> 00:50:21,520
Rym: And funny, sometimes it'll go way under.

940
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:27,020
Rym: Like I saw a game, a couple of games were like in one hand, the bids will be like one, one, zero.

941
00:50:27,401 --> 00:50:30,280
Rym: And then the fourth person's like, uh, seven.

942
00:50:31,193 --> 00:50:31,320
Scott: Yeah.

943
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:33,980
Scott: They got a really bad hand, but everyone else bid way low.

944
00:50:34,384 --> 00:50:36,020
Scott: And the other thing is sometimes you'll underbid.

945
00:50:37,141 --> 00:50:37,740
Scott: By accident.

946
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:38,679
Rym: Well, that was really it.

947
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:46,120
Rym: So when your example, the guy with that high trump, maybe he gets scared away from bidding because he knows like, all right, these guys got fucking wizards or whatever.

948
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:46,372
Rym: Right.

949
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,318
Rym: So he bids zero.

950
00:50:47,781 --> 00:50:53,180
Rym: So now my shit hand is more likely to win because he's doing everything he can to not take any tricks.

951
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:57,140
Scott: So let's say I'm in a situation where I got like, I got a high card of every suit and a wizard.

952
00:50:57,641 --> 00:51:02,360
Scott: So I've got, I think I'm going to take five tricks, but I'm pretty sure one of these is going to get fucked over.

953
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,614
Scott: It's a 10 and not a 13 and green or something.

954
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:09,588
Scott: So I'm like, yeah, someone's going to probably take an 11 or 12 green and I won't get that one.

955
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:10,980
Scott: So I'll go under by one.

956
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:11,642
Scott: I'll bid for.

957
00:51:12,123 --> 00:51:17,739
Scott: then as we play all the I'm forced to play those high suit cards by following suit.

958
00:51:18,221 --> 00:51:21,920
Scott: And I end up taking my four tricks and I still have my wizard in my hand.

959
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:29,820
Rym: So the other thing is when the bidding ends, usually you'll see like a lot like amongst people who are like really smart and good at trick taking games.

960
00:51:30,182 --> 00:51:33,380
Rym: The bids are almost always within one or two of the actual number of tricks.

961
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,279
Scott: I've never been off by more than one.

962
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:36,222
Rym: Yeah, I've been.

963
00:51:36,303 --> 00:51:39,240
Rym: I was off by two or three or four or five in toward the end.

964
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,380
Rym: If you're behind fucking just bid extra.

965
00:51:42,762 --> 00:51:43,580
Scott: If you're going to lose.

966
00:51:43,751 --> 00:51:43,900
Scott: Right.

967
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,715
Scott: Then your only hope to catch up is to try to take more tricks.

968
00:51:47,775 --> 00:51:53,378
Scott: and nothing is like I'll play a hand and I'll bid three and I will take exactly three and say what a good job that was.

969
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,520
Scott: I got it exactly right.

970
00:51:54,742 --> 00:51:56,240
Scott: But I didn't get it exactly right.

971
00:51:56,641 --> 00:51:59,340
Scott: I could have taken four or five tricks.

972
00:51:59,542 --> 00:52:01,080
Scott: I just didn't bet four or five.

973
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,940
Scott: So I chose during the round to not take tricks I could have taken because I bid too low.

974
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:14,880
Scott: So even though I got the right number and got the points and didn't lose points, I could have had more points because I made bidding was not aggressive enough.

975
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,060
Rym: So basically the game has the bidding aspects of bridge.

976
00:52:18,641 --> 00:52:26,458
Rym: It has the trump protection aspects of Euchre and it has the ducking and de suiting tactics of hearts.

977
00:52:27,205 --> 00:52:29,480
Rym: So it combines a lot of my favorite cards.

978
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,665
Scott: It's pretty much everything.

979
00:52:30,705 --> 00:52:33,240
Scott: there is about trick taking games all in one game.

980
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:34,640
Rym: So it comes with a bunch of variants.

981
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:35,217
Rym: Plus wizards.

982
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:36,719
Rym: But whatever.

983
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:39,940
Rym: There is one problem with the game as written.

984
00:52:40,881 --> 00:52:42,819
Rym: The game does not give you a way to deal with Renee.

985
00:52:44,121 --> 00:52:52,579
Rym: So in like in Euchre if you fuck up and forget like you don't follow suit and then later it's like oops I had a heart and I should have played it.

986
00:52:53,105 --> 00:52:54,000
Rym: That doesn't ruin the game.

987
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,220
Rym: The rules basically like the rules deal with that.

988
00:52:56,321 --> 00:52:57,780
Rym: There's a rule for if someone Renee.

989
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:58,839
Scott: So let's say Renee.

990
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:02,760
Rym: Or if you live in the Midwest Renee because they just can't pronounce words.

991
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:09,160
Scott: So let's say Rym has a green card in his hand and I play green and he chooses to play some red card.

992
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,879
Scott: He forgets that he had green in his hand.

993
00:53:11,461 --> 00:53:19,020
Scott: Then we find out later when he plays a green card I say Rym why didn't you follow that green card on the previous two turns ago and I played green.

994
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,420
Rym: Fuck we've ruined the game.

995
00:53:21,263 --> 00:53:21,919
Rym: No way to fix it.

996
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,000
Scott: There's no fix written into the rules.

997
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,204
Scott: Now I know

998
00:53:25,506 --> 00:53:34,864
Rym: I want I'm trying to come up with a rule that we as like our friend group is just going to agree upon as the rule for Renee just so that we don't have to deal with it because the fact

999
00:53:35,004 --> 00:53:41,460
Scott: that I think the rules should be something along the lines of whoever takes that trick should take it according to the cards that were played.

1000
00:53:42,062 --> 00:53:45,880
Scott: But if you are caught basically you just lose chips.

1001
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:46,619
Rym: Yeah.

1002
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:48,860
Rym: You just lose points because you screwed up.

1003
00:53:48,981 --> 00:53:50,577
Rym: I'm trying to figure out like a number of them right.

1004
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,580
Scott: I think the number has to scale up as you get deeper in the game.

1005
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:55,365
Scott: It has to be.

1006
00:53:55,385 --> 00:53:56,620
Scott: the penalty should become worse.

1007
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:57,141
Rym: How about this?

1008
00:53:57,161 --> 00:54:01,336
Rym: you lose a number of chips equal to the number of cards.

1009
00:54:01,658 --> 00:54:02,797
Scott: that might be too much though.

1010
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,720
Scott: But at the same time it also depends on like how significant was the mistake you made.

1011
00:54:07,142 --> 00:54:07,300
Scott: Exactly.

1012
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:15,020
Scott: It might not have mattered like oh you would have played it earlier and not taken the trick and the other card that you did play earlier would have not taken this trick.

1013
00:54:15,821 --> 00:54:17,920
Rym: And also you fucked up everyone else's card counting.

1014
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:18,764
Scott: That's all.

1015
00:54:18,784 --> 00:54:19,900
Scott: the counting cards are very important.

1016
00:54:20,603 --> 00:54:26,780
Rym: So I'm not sure and if anyone has any suggestions discussed in the forum because that's the only flaw with this game.

1017
00:54:28,642 --> 00:54:35,680
Rym: The other thing is that there's a variant I really want to try because one thing that hearts has that makes hearts shooting the shooting the moon.

1018
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:36,104
Scott: No.

1019
00:54:37,382 --> 00:54:39,240
Rym: So in hearts in the first hand.

1020
00:54:40,148 --> 00:54:40,760
Scott: Oh the passing.

1021
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:45,577
Rym: You pick three cards and pass them to the dude to your left and the dude to your right passes three to you.

1022
00:54:46,262 --> 00:54:49,840
Rym: So I know that I gave this motherfucker three spades.

1023
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:53,700
Rym: So I know he's got a bunch of high spades and I don't have any spades.

1024
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:54,579
Rym: It's going to be awesome.

1025
00:54:54,921 --> 00:54:55,112
Scott: Sorry.

1026
00:54:55,601 --> 00:54:58,240
Scott: So you can easily add that to wizard as a variant rule.

1027
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:58,799
Scott: No problem.

1028
00:54:58,940 --> 00:54:59,819
Scott: Here's the question though.

1029
00:55:00,382 --> 00:55:03,380
Scott: Do you bid before or after passing?

1030
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,179
Rym: I think after by default.

1031
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,580
Rym: But hardcore mode is before.

1032
00:55:10,864 --> 00:55:16,590
Scott: I mean you could choose the cards you're going to pass, then bid, then see the cards you're picking up.

1033
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:21,040
Scott: Because remember that you're still getting information from the other people's bids.

1034
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,439
Rym: You could also have something cool where like you're allowed.

1035
00:55:25,041 --> 00:55:28,059
Rym: After you get your cards you're allowed to raise your bid but you can't lower it.

1036
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:29,776
Rym: Like something like that.

1037
00:55:31,102 --> 00:55:34,080
Rym: This game is ripe for custom house rules.

1038
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:38,480
Scott: The thing is with passing cards people are going to dump suit like pretty much immediately.

1039
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:40,140
Rym: Yeah, that's what happens in hearts.

1040
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,840
Scott: Trump cards become way more powerful.

1041
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:46,980
Scott: And you'll be able to take way more tricks if you have any Trumps whatsoever.

1042
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:47,697
Rym: And you know what?

1043
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:48,840
Rym: Much like with Dune.

1044
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:53,040
Scott: So do you reveal Trump before or after the bidding and passing?

1045
00:55:53,321 --> 00:55:54,320
Rym: Much like with Dune.

1046
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,778
Scott: The order matters so much.

1047
00:55:56,481 --> 00:56:00,320
Rym: Even then Scott, much like with Dune everybody has that power.

1048
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,080
Scott: That's correct.

1049
00:56:01,381 --> 00:56:01,959
Scott: And two.

1050
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,899
Scott: But then luck becomes a big factor too.

1051
00:56:04,882 --> 00:56:11,660
Rym: In high level hearts play for example, I would pass my dad two high clubs and a middling to low club.

1052
00:56:12,562 --> 00:56:15,300
Rym: But maybe I didn't desuit myself of clubs.

1053
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:16,400
Scott: Yeah, you got a low club.

1054
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:17,416
Scott: I mean you're going to get rid of that.

1055
00:56:17,436 --> 00:56:17,640
Scott: no problem.

1056
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:18,459
Scott: You kept the low one.

1057
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:24,110
Rym: No, but I gave away a low one to imply that I had gotten rid of all my clubs.

1058
00:56:24,391 --> 00:56:29,020
Rym: and I'm probably some motherfucker who's going to heart and/or queen of spades someone.

1059
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,660
Scott: You held one middling club.

1060
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:31,029
Scott: Yeah.

1061
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,539
Scott: That's still not going to take a trick.

1062
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:33,518
Rym: Hopefully not.

1063
00:56:33,941 --> 00:56:35,826
Rym: So you get into like the card.

1064
00:56:35,906 --> 00:56:41,240
Rym: in high level hearts play, the cards you pass themselves are a whole game of their own.

1065
00:56:41,621 --> 00:56:50,540
Scott: So it's like there's a whole process of seeing your cards, choosing which cards to pass, seeing the cards that were passed to you and seeing what Trump is and seeing the other players bids.

1066
00:56:51,021 --> 00:56:58,240
Scott: And you're also like when in that process the order that you do the things and when the people bid really changes the game a zillion.

1067
00:56:58,742 --> 00:57:04,040
Rym: So if you're an aspiring game designer and you think none of those things sound like a big deal, they're such different games.

1068
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:09,960
Scott: If you don't understand why the order of those things changes the game like ten thousand percent, don't make any games.

1069
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:16,720
Rym: And if you want to be good at this game when you first teach it to your friends, one, play a bunch of hearts online.

1070
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:26,820
Rym: But two, a basic heuristic that a lot of noobs use is guess how many tricks you think you're going to take and go for one less than that because you're probably wrong.

1071
00:57:27,081 --> 00:57:27,301
Scott: Yep.

1072
00:57:27,522 --> 00:57:29,086
Scott: You'll probably get wizarded or something.

1073
00:57:29,106 --> 00:57:34,200
Scott: It's like count the number of awesome trick taking cards in your hand that are powerful, the high Trumps and the wizards and whatever.

1074
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:41,600
Scott: Take that number, subtract one and then try to take that many tricks and you'll probably beat most people who don't know what they're doing.

1075
00:57:43,141 --> 00:57:43,401
Rym: Yeah.

1076
00:57:43,421 --> 00:57:50,453
Rym: And we're going to play, I mean, we're going to play a lot of games at PAX South, but I think wizard is going to be the like, it's going to be the default warm up game or the default.

1077
00:57:50,734 --> 00:57:54,180
Rym: four of us are waiting for you guys to finish eclipse before we do another thing game.

1078
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:54,921
Rym: Mm hmm.

1079
00:57:57,044 --> 00:58:07,300
Rym: Also, uh, at least our thing as came up at PAX offices, anytime someone plays a wizard, they basically sing that thing from Daffy Duck.

1080
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:16,920
Rym: Behold, the wizard is incredible power that that you're pretty much obligated to say that out loud, possibly loudly every time you play a wizard.

1081
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:17,460
Scott: Yeah.

1082
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:21,364
Rym: So, uh, linked to that much like the posing in pen Dante.

1083
00:58:21,384 --> 00:58:25,547
Scott: This game is also, you know, it's a good, right?

1084
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:29,130
Scott: Any good board game, any good tabletop game is going to have a thing that people say.

1085
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:30,402
Rym: Y'all got a brick.

1086
00:58:30,562 --> 00:58:32,246
Rym: Y'all got wood from my sheep.

1087
00:58:32,366 --> 00:58:32,988
Scott: That's right.

1088
00:58:33,529 --> 00:58:38,160
Scott: So the fact that this people are playing this game going wizard shows a good game.
