00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,951
Rym: It's Tuesday February 26th 2019.

2
00:00:12,951 --> 00:00:16,442
Rym: I'm Rym, I'm scared and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,589
Rym: We are reviewing war groove.

4
00:00:20,392 --> 00:00:21,122
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:25,978
Rym: So as you all know I'm not a young man anymore.

6
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:33,463
Rym: so it got warm out like weirdly warm when Yesterday Oh is inside all day.

7
00:00:33,644 --> 00:00:34,910
Rym: It was like 50 degrees like I was out.

8
00:00:36,172 --> 00:00:36,614
Scott: That's cold.

9
00:00:36,695 --> 00:00:39,973
Rym: that's warm for winter that's warm for February It's cold.

10
00:00:40,555 --> 00:00:43,850
Rym: so I was outside decided to go for a run because it was warm outside.

11
00:00:44,273 --> 00:00:46,410
Rym: So I went outside and I was gonna run a short distance.

12
00:00:46,511 --> 00:00:52,433
Rym: I ended up running a half marathon because that's what I do and today Feeling a little bit.

13
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:59,666
Rym: I like to say that 35 ain't 25, and I'm a few years past 35 at this point Mm-hmm.

14
00:01:00,611 --> 00:01:07,038
Rym: But weirdly enough despite like the first run of the season on this weirdly warm day in the middle of nowhere I still got my third best time ever.

15
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,878
Rym: so maybe there's hope for this old man By the time it's undefeated.

16
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:14,329
Rym: Yep, but I'm gonna put up a good fight, okay?

17
00:01:16,633 --> 00:01:18,330
Rym: So you got any news on this gaming day?

18
00:01:18,491 --> 00:01:29,614
Scott: Yeah, there was a huge gaming news between our last episode and this one probably because we bailed on one And that is that Reggie the famous Reggie Fils-aime Pronounced.

19
00:01:29,634 --> 00:01:31,066
Scott: I still can't remember 15 years.

20
00:01:31,106 --> 00:01:31,530
Scott: I can't pronounce.

21
00:01:32,413 --> 00:01:41,185
Rym: I was listening to a gaming podcast like gaming news and two different people on this podcast Pronounced it different ways as of last week, so hey, we'll just call him.

22
00:01:41,205 --> 00:01:42,328
Scott: This is why everyone just calls him Reggie.

23
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:47,090
Scott: anyway He is retiring and he is gonna go to the beach like a wise individual.

24
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:52,337
Scott: It doesn't seem like he has plans to go work anywhere else, so if you don't know I mean I can't imagine you wouldn't know.

25
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,790
Scott: but way back in the day Right nobody knew anyone who works at Nintendo except basically Miyamoto, right?

26
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,910
Scott: That's like if you knew any name in Nintendo.

27
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:02,753
Scott: That's the name you knew.

28
00:02:03,034 --> 00:02:05,582
Rym: if you're every window power you knew about.

29
00:02:06,244 --> 00:02:07,026
Scott: you know a few more.

30
00:02:07,106 --> 00:02:08,169
Rym: You know you will you knew?

31
00:02:09,452 --> 00:02:12,635
Rym: You know at most two names Because of that Nester comic.

32
00:02:13,037 --> 00:02:21,288
Scott: the point is that people would all these kids in elementary school would be like oh Yeah, my uncle works at Nintendo is like this old joke like my girlfriend from Canada.

33
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:23,856
Scott: It's the same kind of joke right?

34
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,928
Scott: cuz no one knew who worked at Nintendo or like you know.

35
00:02:26,948 --> 00:02:29,617
Scott: kids imagined Nintendo like you know they had like this.

36
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:42,444
Scott: you know it's like a Willy Wonka situation right you know they imagined It was like some incredible place, but nowadays We know that Nintendo Japan is where all the actual stuff happens Nintendo of America Nintendo of Europe all those places.

37
00:02:42,525 --> 00:02:54,237
Scott: all they do is distribution mostly marketing Also some translation type stuff occasionally making terrible mistakes customer service Logistics these sorts of things.

38
00:02:54,558 --> 00:02:54,799
Scott: you know.

39
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:56,003
Scott: just to take the product.

40
00:02:56,023 --> 00:03:02,888
Scott: their job is to take the product that real Nintendo in Japan is made and deliver it right to other places on earth.

41
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:10,852
Scott: yep, and The thing that Reggie has done in his 15 years on that job is somehow Make that job Matter.

42
00:03:10,952 --> 00:03:15,870
Scott: the person who had that job before was a Japanese person that no one remembers the name of and no one cares, right?

43
00:03:16,412 --> 00:03:27,890
Scott: Reggie was like this you know he somehow managed to over his 15 year career Never crossed the line to where he would upset the Japanese who were actually his bosses.

44
00:03:28,315 --> 00:03:41,955
Scott: Well at the same time Pushing the line enough to get the right things to happen ever once did he do anything that would actually make them upset that anyone Knows about because obviously they never got fired or in trouble You know.

45
00:03:41,995 --> 00:03:50,344
Scott: so he'd always like talk in a very political business II way But yet he would go basically as hard as he could to be fun.

46
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:50,926
Scott: I'm this.

47
00:03:51,126 --> 00:03:52,450
Scott: I'm the president of Nintendo.

48
00:03:53,415 --> 00:04:04,453
Scott: Before he was president He was still like the face of Nintendo America even before then because I remember him when he was just you know that the VP of marketing or whatever for Nintendo or whatever.

49
00:04:04,513 --> 00:04:10,150
Scott: his previous job was some VP job, and he was still the face of Nintendo America at that time, right?

50
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:10,452
Scott: He's like.

51
00:04:10,472 --> 00:04:20,149
Scott: we knew him before he was president and now He's retiring to go to the beach as you should yep, and the guy who's taking over the internet had a field day.

52
00:04:20,998 --> 00:04:21,584
Scott: Cuz his name.

53
00:04:21,603 --> 00:04:22,110
Scott: he's the ease.

54
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:26,837
Scott: I think he has the job that Reggie used to have like no Marketing because the job is mostly a marketing job.

55
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:29,265
Rym: all that says is this nominative determinism.

56
00:04:29,505 --> 00:04:43,837
Scott: the guy's name is Doug Bowser And in the back of a photo of him and presumably in his office there were some Nintendo plushies and the Mario and Luigi Plushies were tied together with like a controller a Kidnap back-to-back

57
00:04:43,857 --> 00:04:44,640
Rym: hostage style

58
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,990
Scott: saying he knows what his name is and what his job is.

59
00:04:49,193 --> 00:05:00,549
Scott: But since he's not a person who like we've ever seen or heard from before in public I'm wondering if he will be as public and you know outward in the position as Reggie was.

60
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:03,961
Rym: I Imagine they want to keep this like the relationship.

61
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:06,190
Rym: They've got going now with the American audience alive.

62
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:08,803
Rym: I feel like that was part of the job description now.

63
00:05:08,824 --> 00:05:17,050
Scott: I wonder also You know how public Reggie will be in his retirement, or will he be you know hidden away and disappeared like oh?

64
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:17,823
Scott: Whatever happened to him?

65
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,637
Rym: I mean I feel like the only ways to go.

66
00:05:19,677 --> 00:05:26,076
Rym: if you step down from a position like that or either You just disappear and enjoy your life on the beach Yeah, but you go on it like a speaking this.

67
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:33,865
Scott: things he can do without you know working too much Right like do interviews and tell well that's a little before going.

68
00:05:33,905 --> 00:05:35,049
Scott: you know speaking gigs.

69
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:39,570
Rym: option Two is the low-key speaking gigs that do not rock the boat.

70
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,576
Scott: You know the kind of stuff that like former presidents do.

71
00:05:41,737 --> 00:05:45,469
Rym: option three is former presidents tell all here's what I would have done.

72
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:47,517
Rym: mother Three let's go right.

73
00:05:47,537 --> 00:05:48,360
Scott: You know he can be like.

74
00:05:48,742 --> 00:05:48,962
Scott: you know.

75
00:05:49,003 --> 00:05:50,689
Scott: yeah, you know they tell.

76
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:51,514
Scott: you know I'm sure he has some.

77
00:05:51,615 --> 00:05:52,521
Scott: you know ndas and stuff.

78
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,770
Scott: They could sue him if he's too bad.

79
00:05:53,911 --> 00:06:03,089
Scott: Yeah, you know you get the idea, but yeah I guess you know even if you don't care about Nintendo right it's weird like do you know who the president in Nintendo Europe is?

80
00:06:04,751 --> 00:06:05,072
Scott: Right?

81
00:06:05,253 --> 00:06:11,114
Scott: no because I mean I think I've seen their name in some articles before but clearly they're doing a much shittier job Than Reggie did.

82
00:06:11,555 --> 00:06:18,059
Scott: right you know Reggie is someone who will be I guess missed and was maybe under-appreciated until now.

83
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:23,909
Scott: you realize like uh yeah Cuz we had it we had a good for 15 plus years.

84
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:28,324
Rym: Yep, Nintendo's been doing the right things as far as the North American market has been.

85
00:06:28,344 --> 00:06:32,885
Scott: I mean he has never done wrong With regards to the things he had power to do.

86
00:06:32,905 --> 00:06:35,196
Scott: true true And the only really come.

87
00:06:35,296 --> 00:06:43,770
Scott: any complaint that anyone could levy a Reggie about how he did his job Were things that were beyond his control because like I said he never pushed the line and upset the Japanese people.

88
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,169
Scott: It's like bring us mother three.

89
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,657
Scott: It's like he could have got.

90
00:06:46,737 --> 00:06:52,827
Scott: how do we know he could have gone to the Japanese people and said like bring mother three like A hundred times, but they make they call it shots and everything.

91
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:53,490
Rym: yeah, what are you gonna?

92
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:58,199
Scott: Do I heard I've heard rumors of stories where he said things in meetings and the Japanese people just like scoffing.

93
00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:08,352
Scott: nor him or I think the only I think someone said the only influence Reggie ever had in the product is one time He said hey, maybe you should sell switch doc separately, and they did.

94
00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:11,505
Scott: that's the rumor I've heard That you know.

95
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:18,931
Rym: so I guess it'll be interesting to see What public persona coalesces around Bowser right.

96
00:07:18,991 --> 00:07:22,740
Scott: is he gonna be like a Tim Cook or he's not quite a Steve Jobs situation?

97
00:07:23,102 --> 00:07:24,649
Rym: I feel like that's nothing I get.

98
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,292
Scott: it's like it's hard.

99
00:07:25,895 --> 00:07:26,820
Scott: It's a hard shoe to fill.

100
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:30,996
Rym: I feel like he's got a curry bow shoe is the hardest shoe to fell right.

101
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,648
Rym: I feel like Because of the name.

102
00:07:33,668 --> 00:07:35,840
Rym: you gotta lean into that.

103
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:44,431
Scott: But he could end up being corny with it and not you know sincere and do it in a good Sincere but with like a slight evil edge like a little.

104
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:49,787
Rym: you got to play the evil like subtle and appropriate Like the year of Luigi.

105
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,735
Rym: I feel like you're gonna have the year of Waluigi.

106
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:52,839
Rym: Just like sneak its way in.

107
00:07:55,682 --> 00:07:57,068
Rym: Nobody wants the year of Waluigi.

108
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:04,916
Rym: no so in some other news you might have noticed We're not gonna talk about all this, but there have been a ton of layoffs.

109
00:08:05,077 --> 00:08:05,899
Scott: We talked about the Blizzard.

110
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:17,599
Rym: one Yeah But not just Blizzard like basically as far as I can see like half the Australian game dev scene Just got laid off like tons of layoffs in the video game industry, which ah There's a lot of reasons for that.

111
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,632
Rym: I don't want to speculate publicly too much.

112
00:08:19,693 --> 00:08:30,832
Rym: part of it might be that Stock markets globally not doing great for a lot of reasons a lot of companies not as profitable as the market wanted them to be Even if they were otherwise very successful.

113
00:08:30,852 --> 00:08:36,357
Rym: a good way to get more Investor interest is to have layoffs to reduce cost etc.

114
00:08:36,398 --> 00:08:36,498
Rym: etc.

115
00:08:37,462 --> 00:08:42,520
Rym: But a quiet layoff happened that the GeekNights listener might care about quite a bit.

116
00:08:43,082 --> 00:08:46,193
Rym: So this is Kotaku dateline for theater.

117
00:08:46,213 --> 00:08:51,578
Rym: at 30 p.m.. Eastern Standard Time today GOG just laid off like a day yesterday.

118
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:53,712
Rym: ah Yes yesterday.

119
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:56,044
Rym: well This happened.

120
00:08:56,104 --> 00:09:02,460
Rym: dateline for 30 p.m.. On the 25th, which is not tonight when we are recording this show.

121
00:09:03,762 --> 00:09:07,680
Rym: So GOG laid off apparently a dozen people and what's interesting?

122
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,318
Scott: They're not that big so it doesn't a large percentage of their people.

123
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:14,780
Rym: yeah GOG is the DRM free like cool kids place to buy your games.

124
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:19,180
Scott: The main thing about GOG is like they do sell some newer games and some other stuff.

125
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,471
Scott: Yeah, it seems to be some relation between GOG and humble bundle.

126
00:09:22,491 --> 00:09:23,133
Scott: That's vague.

127
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:33,698
Scott: I'm not sure about that, but They main thing that they have going for them that say steam You know does doesn't have going for them so much is that there's a lot of way.

128
00:09:33,979 --> 00:09:47,437
Scott: old DOS era type PC games that are available on GOG that you can buy on GOG DRM free and They include DOS box and everything else already set up ready to run, so they're pretty cool.

129
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:54,435
Rym: Yeah So they've laid off a bunch of people and what's interesting and they're making that much money.

130
00:09:54,676 --> 00:09:55,720
Rym: Yeah, well now.

131
00:09:56,502 --> 00:09:58,368
Rym: So if you didn't know they're by.

132
00:09:58,388 --> 00:10:02,019
Scott: it feels like people bought their DOS games from GOG and then didn't buy anything else there.

133
00:10:02,421 --> 00:10:03,927
Scott: I mean on steam they only.

134
00:10:04,268 --> 00:10:05,894
Scott: so I only go to GOG.

135
00:10:05,935 --> 00:10:08,915
Scott: calm when I see a link that says Something's free on GOG today.

136
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:12,512
Scott: I go there I click the link to add it to my GOG library and then I leave.

137
00:10:12,532 --> 00:10:14,560
Scott: of course even then I forget to go play it.

138
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:19,713
Rym: Some of the things I would have bought on GOG I just forgot to and then they ended up on steam.

139
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:21,200
Rym: and I bought him on steam because it was just easier.

140
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,925
Scott: Well, that's the thing is buy them on steam.

141
00:10:22,965 --> 00:10:25,974
Scott: It's easier and also you buy it on steam.

142
00:10:26,015 --> 00:10:27,740
Scott: It's usually cheaper, right?

143
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:34,180
Scott: I mean GOG does have some crazy sales just like steam, but it's like, you know steam DRM free.

144
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,900
Scott: It's like I've had steam account for as long as Reggie was president.

145
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,085
Scott: So I'm not.

146
00:10:40,145 --> 00:10:43,095
Scott: well, I'm not too worried about the DRM aspect of steam.

147
00:10:43,116 --> 00:10:47,608
Rym: So GOG said that quote.

148
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:54,959
Rym: we've been a rearranging certain team since October 2018 Effecting and closing around a dozen positions last week blah blah blah.

149
00:10:55,441 --> 00:10:56,283
Rym: They basically said that.

150
00:10:56,323 --> 00:11:09,860
Rym: despite that they've welcomed nearly twice as many new team members as they laid off and they currently have 20 open Positions, it's always interesting when a company lays a bunch of people off and simultaneously has a whole bunch of open positions to fill.

151
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:15,339
Scott: Well, I mean it could just be that like hey They decided they want to do less of X and more of Y. so it's like.

152
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:16,124
Scott: well I want to do.

153
00:11:16,144 --> 00:11:18,660
Scott: you know, if I'm making a video game for example, right?

154
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,100
Scott: I'm a video game studio and maybe I realize like hey, I don't need you know, the markets changed.

155
00:11:24,261 --> 00:11:26,636
Scott: I don't need fancy graphics to sell my games anymore.

156
00:11:26,817 --> 00:11:29,003
Scott: I need Microtransactions and gambling.

157
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:37,799
Scott: so I fire all my artists and I hire a bunch of psychologists and people from the gambling industry To make them help make my loot box better, right?

158
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,831
Scott: Yeah, I'm laying pla 20 people love and I heard 20 people.

159
00:11:41,871 --> 00:11:42,273
Scott: It's a problem.

160
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:43,940
Rym: So here's an alternative perspective.

161
00:11:44,724 --> 00:11:47,440
Rym: I'm quoting Kotaku here because this is relatively breaking news.

162
00:11:48,022 --> 00:11:57,300
Rym: One person who was laid off from GOG last week offered a different perspective Saying that laid off staff were told that this was a move made by a company in dire straits.

163
00:11:57,882 --> 00:12:01,357
Rym: That person estimated the layoffs that hit 10% of GOG staff.

164
00:12:01,498 --> 00:12:02,000
Scott: That sounds right.

165
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:13,351
Rym: Yeah, so it's likely that GOG not making money Potentially losing money May be growing in terms of like its costs.

166
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:16,000
Scott: Well, it could be that the people they just hired, right?

167
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,163
Scott: It was like oops too many.

168
00:12:17,183 --> 00:12:22,280
Scott: and then companies even that will often put up lots of open positions.

169
00:12:22,702 --> 00:12:27,120
Scott: They won't suddenly like take those down because then it looks like they're in dire straits.

170
00:12:27,582 --> 00:12:32,220
Scott: So they companies will often have open positions listed and simply not hire anyone.

171
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:38,797
Rym: I know for a fact that certain unnamed game companies in the last few years have done just that.

172
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:56,120
Rym: they have literally Hired people who because they had open positions while they were planning to lay off a large number of people Including the people they just hired they continued hiring for positions that were already Flagged as being redundant or going to be removed.

173
00:12:56,462 --> 00:12:58,810
Rym: that is not uncommon in the games industry.

174
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,896
Rym: Yeah I'm not saying GOG did this.

175
00:13:01,298 --> 00:13:10,410
Scott: I'm saying that happens because if you suddenly take down the open positions You're like revealing your financial in news - at the wrong time for Wall Street or whatever.

176
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,454
Rym: Yeah, or not even Wall Street.

177
00:13:11,495 --> 00:13:25,828
Rym: if you think people don't notice that people who work for companies like this There they know when something's up and they're like one person will notice that a job posting Like fell through or disappeared and then suddenly literally everyone will know.

178
00:13:27,611 --> 00:13:31,730
Rym: So in some other brief news, I got a little geek bite that I want to share.

179
00:13:32,232 --> 00:13:35,889
Rym: So, uh, you know, I got a Oculus Rift and I play a whole bunch of VR games.

180
00:13:36,591 --> 00:13:38,461
Rym: There's a little game that you might not notice.

181
00:13:38,763 --> 00:13:40,010
Rym: There's a non VR version.

182
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,509
Rym: I guess I don't see why you would ever want to play this game not in VR.

183
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,304
Scott: I think it's on the same reason like you would never play the bomb game.

184
00:13:47,686 --> 00:13:48,128
Scott: Don't talk it.

185
00:13:48,148 --> 00:13:48,690
Scott: No one explodes.

186
00:13:49,112 --> 00:13:50,117
Scott: Play that and not VR.

187
00:13:50,217 --> 00:13:52,810
Rym: Yeah, like if you got like that's a game that's a must play game.

188
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,356
Rym: If you got VR not worth it.

189
00:13:54,416 --> 00:14:02,690
Rym: Otherwise, yeah thumper if I hadn't after the rabbit, uh So it's hard to say why it's called thumper.

190
00:14:03,191 --> 00:14:08,926
Rym: But the gist of this game is that it is a VR spiritual successor to Vib ribbon.

191
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:10,550
Scott: All right, so it's a rhythm game.

192
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:14,766
Rym: It's a rhythm game, but the shtick the reason why it's interesting music is good.

193
00:14:15,006 --> 00:14:15,970
Rym: The music is fantastic.

194
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,135
Scott: You're loading your own music.

195
00:14:17,718 --> 00:14:20,229
Rym: not that I'm aware of but I don't want to give ribbon on ps1.

196
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:30,616
Scott: I'm pretty sure you could take the river of in discount putting your own audio CD Yep with the red book audio and you could and I remember one time we did that at Luke's house back at RIT And had a really good time with it.

197
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,689
Rym: But thumper is a psychedelic experience.

198
00:14:35,276 --> 00:14:40,399
Rym: It is like It's scarily immersive and intense to play.

199
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:46,123
Rym: the rhythm game component is very simple and much like Vib ribbon It starts with a very simple like.

200
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:47,310
Rym: you only have two buttons.

201
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:56,350
Rym: you can use the stick to turn your direction on a track and you can Hit a button and the button will do a thing and bit by bit it increases the complexity.

202
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,750
Rym: It increases the complexity in a really nuanced and clever way.

203
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:11,189
Rym: but the shtick is that you're basically in this infinite crazy not like four dimensional space-time and You're basically fighting the Cthulhu style.

204
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:14,397
Rym: old gods one by one with your rhythm skills.

205
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:18,231
Scott: sounds like rez Yeah, so maybe like something I'm surprised.

206
00:15:18,311 --> 00:15:20,580
Scott: rez is the one that came with like that vibrating thing, right?

207
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:26,939
Scott: Yeah, especially so it's like why doesn't someone just make a game where you get an old rez controller and it's in VR?

208
00:15:27,602 --> 00:15:28,625
Scott: It just sounds pretty close.

209
00:15:28,645 --> 00:15:31,194
Rym: Uh, I think this is better than rez.

210
00:15:31,214 --> 00:15:32,660
Rym: I think it's more fun to play rez.

211
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:34,309
Rym: I've seen people play rez.

212
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:35,959
Rym: I've seen video of rez.

213
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:37,750
Rym: This looks like it's better than rez.

214
00:15:37,931 --> 00:15:39,480
Rym: Anyway, I mean someone could prove me wrong.

215
00:15:39,902 --> 00:15:43,196
Rym: I haven't actually played rez, but this game is real good.

216
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,109
Rym: So if you have an oculus then you should just like.

217
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:46,953
Rym: this is one of those games.

218
00:15:47,194 --> 00:15:48,560
Rym: You should just buy and play.

219
00:15:55,535 --> 00:15:58,050
Rym: but anyway things of the day.

220
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:58,632
Rym: What do you got?

221
00:15:58,953 --> 00:16:08,241
Scott: so an Instagram right if you take photos of like the story mode of whatever you can like put stuff on The photos like text and emojis and effects and all kinds of stuff.

222
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:21,752
Scott: What I didn't know is that you can totally do that in like videos in Instagram and they added a feature apparently where you can pin things to objects in the video.

223
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:36,872
Scott: so I for example, I could take a pic a video of like the back of Rym's shirt and Create like a virtual kick me sign and even though I'm moving around and Rym's moving around It will stick that you know, it'll recognize Rym and try to keep that kick me sign on his back All right.

224
00:16:37,113 --> 00:16:37,756
Rym: Yeah, not bad.

225
00:16:37,936 --> 00:16:38,499
Rym: Like that's.

226
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:41,290
Rym: that's moderately easy to do in like Premiere or After Effects.

227
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:44,569
Scott: You can do it in Instagram like in real time while you're like.

228
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,909
Rym: It'll be a little janky, but it'll work for the purposes of a meme.

229
00:16:48,613 --> 00:16:51,150
Scott: Anyway, so it's the it's like called the pinning tool.

230
00:16:51,371 --> 00:16:55,305
Scott: So this dude he's demonstrating the pinning tool and to demonstrate the pinning tool.

231
00:16:55,526 --> 00:16:56,128
Scott: He's in New York.

232
00:16:56,148 --> 00:17:15,353
Scott: clearly he videos some pigeons and he puts funny text on the individual pigeons and That and that funny text is both a funny showing you how to creatively use the pinning tool for humor But also it instructive and shows you how to use the pinning tool Effectively, right.

233
00:17:15,473 --> 00:17:17,601
Scott: so you can now make your own similar videos.

234
00:17:17,681 --> 00:17:19,207
Scott: Well and not crapily.

235
00:17:19,227 --> 00:17:22,419
Scott: so Maybe I'll make if I get some ideas.

236
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:28,490
Scott: I'll make funny videos at the pinning tool and This person for creative inspiration and also technical know-how.

237
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,930
Rym: So when Scott sent me this as this thing of the day the first thing I thought was really a tweet.

238
00:17:32,473 --> 00:17:37,329
Rym: But I laughed out loud at the first one the winner for best sidewalk.

239
00:17:39,572 --> 00:17:40,300
Rym: I laughed out loud.

240
00:17:44,511 --> 00:17:49,669
Rym: So if Scott's thing of the day is a really good tweet my thing of the day is an hour-long video.

241
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:54,762
Rym: great However, so SB nation has a bunch of good sports videos and it's Tuesday.

242
00:17:54,802 --> 00:17:56,126
Scott: So small down all they do.

243
00:17:56,267 --> 00:17:59,623
Scott: Yeah, maybe they're hiring They who got laid off from GOG.

244
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:00,810
Rym: They have a really good series.

245
00:18:00,891 --> 00:18:03,850
Rym: I think I linked to is the thing of the day a while ago on weird rules and sports.

246
00:18:04,172 --> 00:18:13,970
Rym: They're like, this is why you can't make a snowman In front of the net before you run away to pull the goalie like they made a rule because someone literally did it one time.

247
00:18:14,171 --> 00:18:25,659
Rym: Yeah, this video is an hour long and it is a data-driven search for in the entire modern NFL The saddest punt ever.

248
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,167
Scott: I mean, it's I don't need a like a survey.

249
00:18:28,187 --> 00:18:29,350
Scott: I can just tell you it's Matt Dodge.

250
00:18:29,812 --> 00:18:30,676
Rym: Well, it's not.

251
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:31,540
Scott: how is it not?

252
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,102
Scott: they're wrong.

253
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:33,690
Rym: So here's the thing this video.

254
00:18:34,532 --> 00:18:44,903
Rym: It's a goddamn hour-long video that gives a lot of context about every like the 46,000 punts in recent history in the NFL.

255
00:18:45,244 --> 00:18:48,773
Rym: in detail as to what would make a punt said Why do you punt?

256
00:18:49,054 --> 00:18:49,796
Rym: when do you punt?

257
00:18:50,077 --> 00:18:51,561
Rym: when do people normally punt?

258
00:18:51,862 --> 00:18:54,770
Rym: when have teams fucked up and punted when they shouldn't have?

259
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:55,611
Rym: Etc.

260
00:18:55,972 --> 00:19:04,280
Rym: and eventually it settles on at about the 20-minute mark the mathematical formula to determine the Sadness of a punts.

261
00:19:05,286 --> 00:19:13,310
Rym: and then from there For example, if you punt on the third like third and five when you're losing that's pretty fucking sad.

262
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:15,789
Rym: Like yeah, why don't you try to get yardage?

263
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,455
Rym: Like why are you punting?

264
00:19:17,475 --> 00:19:21,110
Rym: and it goes on like the further down could be a quick kick situation.

265
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,638
Scott: I've seen that a couple times in my life.

266
00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:23,401
Scott: Oh, yes.

267
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,410
Scott: I've seen Tom Brady do the the quick kick Yep.

268
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,213
Rym: So it covers that.

269
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:31,390
Rym: it's basically this combination of field position distance to first down the current score.

270
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,920
Rym: Like are you losing by a lot versus?

271
00:19:34,182 --> 00:19:35,346
Rym: are you losing by a little versus?

272
00:19:35,387 --> 00:19:36,150
Rym: are you up a little bit?

273
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:37,855
Rym: How much time is left on the clock?

274
00:19:38,216 --> 00:19:39,701
Rym: and then there's a magic veto.

275
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:42,270
Rym: for was there an extenuating circumstance?

276
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,896
Rym: Like was it a clever quick kick?

277
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:47,010
Rym: and then the formula determines a sadness rating.

278
00:19:47,191 --> 00:19:55,441
Scott: Usually you do the quick kick is like where the quarterback will do a crappy punt because they're quarterback Yep, right on third down because the other team has no idea you're punting.

279
00:19:55,762 --> 00:20:02,269
Scott: So basically you kick it downfield not very far But now there's no way the other team will not won't have a return man down there?

280
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,579
Scott: Yeah to get the punt so there's no way they can return.

281
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:07,070
Scott: is that that's a quick kick for any football nerds?

282
00:20:07,532 --> 00:20:12,026
Scott: So a typical punt in a football I'm sure on YouTube if you type Tom Brady quick kick You'll see it.

283
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:19,068
Rym: So a typical punt in a football game in the modern NFL will get a sadness score of between one and three based on this math.

284
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:27,110
Rym: Then for the rest of the video we go through the ten saddest punts in history, which have scores in the upper three hundreds.

285
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:30,537
Rym: It's really funny.

286
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:32,970
Rym: this is a really engaging and fascinating video.

287
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,489
Scott: I don't know how Matt Dodge wasn't number one, but it's got to be up there.

288
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:37,115
Rym: Yeah, you should watch the like.

289
00:20:37,316 --> 00:20:39,041
Rym: this video is actually in my opinion.

290
00:20:39,061 --> 00:20:40,346
Scott: Is Matt Dodge even mentioned?

291
00:20:41,088 --> 00:20:41,610
Rym: Watch your video.

292
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,336
Rym: It's an hour long.

293
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:42,880
Scott: You can.

294
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,190
Scott: now it's an hour fucking long.

295
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,066
Scott: It was someone posted a video on the other day where?

296
00:20:48,330 --> 00:21:00,046
Scott: Someone was riding a motorcycle up a Japanese mountain and on the side of the road on the Japanese mountain was a statue of Sonic the Hedgehog on a snowboard Just randomly on the side of a mountain.

297
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:06,870
Scott: and this this Motorcycle guy stopped took a photo of his bike next to the Sonic statue and there's a 15-minute video of like.

298
00:21:07,191 --> 00:21:08,476
Scott: Why is this statue there?

299
00:21:08,536 --> 00:21:11,788
Scott: And I'm like, I'm not watching a 15-minute fucking video.

300
00:21:11,808 --> 00:21:12,310
Rym: There's a chance.

301
00:21:13,575 --> 00:21:14,659
Scott: Fuck the statue is there.

302
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,503
Rym: there's a chance.

303
00:21:15,523 --> 00:21:17,310
Rym: There's a 15-minute long explanation.

304
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:20,441
Scott: No So someone one person in the comments was like we actually don't know.

305
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:36,410
Scott: the guy just speculated and his number one Speculation was the town Bought it after like it was used as like a display at some game packs equivalent game fair type thing in Japan and then they just stuck it in the side of the road because when it snows it looks like he's snowboarding.

306
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,557
Scott: So this video has been sitting there ever since.

307
00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:42,110
Rym: this video is not like an hour wasting your time just for the list.

308
00:21:42,371 --> 00:21:50,490
Scott: This video is mostly an explanation of like the statistical mechanics Statistics to know that mad dodge is the saddest part of all time.

309
00:21:50,691 --> 00:21:54,431
Rym: It's fascinating though to look at like all these methods your piece of shit Eagles Like.

310
00:21:54,472 --> 00:22:04,570
Rym: it talks about how up to a point the pooch punt was a pretty valuable thing and then for various reasons It suddenly became non-viable and then it talks about the last fucking attempt at a pooch fund.

311
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:18,089
Rym: this is this is just a really fun video that I enjoy deeply because it's so statistically driven and you get to see a lot of footage from like Early 2000s football which again reminds you that TV looked like shit.

312
00:22:19,995 --> 00:22:21,289
Scott: TV look like garbage.

313
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:33,656
Rym: yep, the other funniest part of this video is there's a Rada in the YouTube comment because in a video this long you're gonna make some mistakes and At 40 31 I'm gonna read the quote.

314
00:22:33,857 --> 00:22:38,550
Rym: as to the errata for this video because they made a mistake about the city of Buffalo quote.

315
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:40,176
Rym: I can't believe I did this.

316
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:43,750
Rym: the bills are not Buffalo's only major sports team.

317
00:22:44,152 --> 00:22:47,150
Rym: I forgot about the NHL's own Buffalo Sabres.

318
00:22:47,852 --> 00:22:48,990
Rym: sincere apologies.

319
00:22:49,913 --> 00:22:54,286
Rym: He literally forgot SV nation forgot that Buffalo has an NHL team.

320
00:22:54,546 --> 00:22:55,690
Scott: Well, I mean, it's a football expert.

321
00:22:56,373 --> 00:22:59,547
Rym: Yeah, but you forget that the Sabres exist.

322
00:22:59,608 --> 00:23:02,497
Scott: I mean Not everyone knows every sports team.

323
00:23:02,838 --> 00:23:05,626
Scott: Yeah, can you name every sport every NFL team even hell?

324
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:06,148
Rym: No, mr.

325
00:23:06,168 --> 00:23:09,118
Scott: Mr Punting thing of the day hell.

326
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,110
Rym: no, I can probably name two-thirds of them.

327
00:23:11,331 --> 00:23:14,570
Scott: I could I could do it, but I'm pretty sure I could do it, but it would be slow.

328
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:19,270
Scott: Yeah, I had to go I had to look at a map and like really yeah, even NHL I could do it.

329
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,070
Rym: But I get a look at a map of cities to remind.

330
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:21,954
Scott: I just have to look at it.

331
00:23:22,035 --> 00:23:24,065
Scott: I just I just need a graphic of the u.s.

332
00:23:24,085 --> 00:23:25,150
Scott: So I can go state-by-state.

333
00:23:25,231 --> 00:23:28,656
Scott: I don't even need any lines on it except for the state lines For the NFL.

334
00:23:28,676 --> 00:23:30,609
Scott: definitely don't need any words on it for the NHL.

335
00:23:30,851 --> 00:23:34,589
Rym: No, I just need a map so I can go like west to east to like remember where I am.

336
00:23:35,292 --> 00:23:39,948
Scott: But the Canada map though - yeah, yeah, can you find Winnipeg on a Canada map?

337
00:23:40,028 --> 00:23:45,142
Rym: Yeah So my trouble would be the the NBA.

338
00:23:45,263 --> 00:23:51,566
Rym: I probably couldn't name more than like 20 teams and baseball 10 maybe I just don't.

339
00:23:52,453 --> 00:23:57,811
Rym: The other funny thing about SB nation is a lot of their videos the they have this running gag of The.

340
00:23:57,892 --> 00:24:03,950
Rym: the primary goal of anyone playing baseball is to find an excuse to sneak out of a game and not get noticed.

341
00:24:05,051 --> 00:24:06,196
Rym: They really don't like baseball.

342
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,410
Rym: So anyway in the meta moment, we are actually doing the book club.

343
00:24:10,093 --> 00:24:10,495
Rym: We're both.

344
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:11,259
Rym: I have.

345
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,256
Rym: I am nearly I'm like halfway through reading The book club book.

346
00:24:15,336 --> 00:24:19,010
Scott: it took me exactly the amount of time that the Kindle predicted it would take me.

347
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:21,786
Scott: It was like a six seven subway ride book.

348
00:24:21,826 --> 00:24:22,390
Scott: Maybe seven.

349
00:24:22,751 --> 00:24:26,804
Rym: I started reading it on Sunday and I'm already about a third of the way.

350
00:24:26,824 --> 00:24:31,438
Scott: This is the longest we have gone Book club wise without doing the book club.

351
00:24:31,739 --> 00:24:39,086
Scott: Not that I didn't read any books that within that time period actually read like Yeah, that wasn't for the book club like six novels worth.

352
00:24:39,568 --> 00:24:50,242
Scott: but Yeah, it didn't take very long to read 2001 a Space Odyssey which we will discuss this Thursday Yep, and this Rym fails unless I fail to finish the book by that.

353
00:24:50,302 --> 00:24:52,910
Rym: I think I'll finish it unless things are real short.

354
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,335
Scott: I read it like so fast.

355
00:24:54,516 --> 00:24:57,707
Rym: No, I burned through like two chapters just while I was pooping today.

356
00:24:57,847 --> 00:24:58,510
Scott: Yeah, that's about right.

357
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:14,607
Rym: So otherwise we will be live at two upcoming conventions gig nights not Scott just rain will be a zinc icon doing a bunch of Panels, I don't remember which panels I'm doing nor do I know when they are but I'm assuming someone will point me in the direction of the panel room.

358
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:16,218
Rym: It's funny.

359
00:25:16,238 --> 00:25:20,923
Rym: when I'm at a non packs I will be at home sleeping me like when Scott and I are at pax's.

360
00:25:20,943 --> 00:25:22,870
Scott: it's warm enough to maybe start biking.

361
00:25:23,132 --> 00:25:25,184
Rym: We've gone to so many conventions over the years.

362
00:25:25,204 --> 00:25:26,170
Rym: that packs and magfest.

363
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:26,712
Rym: We're like.

364
00:25:27,013 --> 00:25:27,997
Rym: we're so into that.

365
00:25:28,057 --> 00:25:32,915
Rym: like we show up to the panel room like an hour before the panel We're like, you're not that early.

366
00:25:32,995 --> 00:25:33,678
Scott: Well, exactly.

367
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:37,930
Rym: Well 40 minutes because then at a half hour, they let it in I'm like 30 or 20.

368
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:44,298
Rym: Well, we don't let us into the room until 30 minutes before and then we have to set up all the cameras and do all The crap and get the pre-roll go in.

369
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,233
Rym: but any non packs non magfest I feel like.

370
00:25:48,594 --> 00:25:54,416
Rym: I feel like that anime guests like the voice actor who just kind of staggers into the con and is like So, where am I going?

371
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:55,642
Rym: What am I doing?

372
00:25:56,165 --> 00:25:56,989
Rym: What city are we in?

373
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,270
Rym: But Zenkai Con is a fun con.

374
00:26:00,093 --> 00:26:14,759
Rym: I do like performing there because the people who see us perform at Zenkai Con are not the kind of people who go to packs or like anime Boston when we used to go there and it's like this entirely new audience where I Can amaze them with things like.

375
00:26:15,161 --> 00:26:27,530
Rym: I can show them that slide from that Game panel where we show like the two ponds and the chutes and ladders thing and ask the question Which one of these ponds is currently winning the game and blow everybody's mind?

376
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:31,271
Rym: I can I can bring out like packs gems Like.

377
00:26:31,492 --> 00:26:33,318
Rym: does anyone know the real rules to monopoly?

378
00:26:33,378 --> 00:26:36,750
Rym: and no one knows and I get to explain that whole thing all over again.

379
00:26:37,613 --> 00:26:38,958
Rym: It's like babes to the slaughter.

380
00:26:38,978 --> 00:26:40,022
Rym: It's a good time.

381
00:26:40,122 --> 00:26:41,427
Scott: PAX East is way soon.

382
00:26:41,447 --> 00:26:43,757
Rym: We're gonna be there Yep, and we're doing at least one panel.

383
00:26:43,777 --> 00:26:46,690
Rym: We were gonna be doing the real harm of games.

384
00:26:47,311 --> 00:26:48,194
Scott: I got this whole panel.

385
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:48,655
Scott: It's it's.

386
00:26:48,936 --> 00:26:50,320
Scott: I just gotta actually construct it.

387
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:50,661
Rym: Yep.

388
00:26:50,922 --> 00:26:52,125
Rym: What harm to games cause.

389
00:26:52,346 --> 00:26:53,910
Rym: do they make school shooters?

390
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,317
Rym: Do they make Satanists?

391
00:26:55,478 --> 00:26:58,334
Rym: I would argue Satanism isn't even a harm But in fact a boon.

392
00:26:58,856 --> 00:26:59,037
Rym: what?

393
00:26:59,358 --> 00:27:00,161
Rym: what did gate?

394
00:27:00,241 --> 00:27:02,450
Rym: a lot of people thought games harmed us a whole bunch of different ways.

395
00:27:02,891 --> 00:27:04,156
Rym: Did they actually harm us?

396
00:27:04,377 --> 00:27:05,701
Rym: Is there any evidence of harm?

397
00:27:06,203 --> 00:27:08,290
Rym: Well, yeah, probably and we're gonna talk about it.

398
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,094
Rym: It's gonna be a good panel.

399
00:27:09,255 --> 00:27:09,456
Rym: Hmm.

400
00:27:10,221 --> 00:27:11,266
Rym: So yeah, let's get right into it.

401
00:27:11,608 --> 00:27:18,630
Rym: We well me I Have been desperate for a long time for a game to replace the hole in my heart that is advanced.

402
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,537
Scott: Well, you've been desperate for just more advanced war.

403
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:23,067
Rym: I fucking love advanced wars to a degree.

404
00:27:23,107 --> 00:27:23,890
Rym: That is unhealthy.

405
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:29,690
Scott: It's been like one of our top game Franchises since college when I was brought to the United States.

406
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:33,886
Scott: I have played if you don't count that NES desert whatever was but I have played that.

407
00:27:33,946 --> 00:27:35,090
Scott: in fact, I played desert.

408
00:27:35,693 --> 00:27:36,476
Scott: I saw it in a magazine.

409
00:27:36,677 --> 00:27:44,030
Rym: I rented desert commander from a non National video rentals chain that also had beta tapes.

410
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,274
Scott: Yeah, so people don't know.

411
00:27:45,294 --> 00:27:47,761
Scott: the series started off way back.

412
00:27:47,802 --> 00:27:49,005
Scott: There was Famicom Wars.

413
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:50,510
Scott: Yeah, it was Game Boy Wars.

414
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,216
Scott: There was Game Boy Color Wars.

415
00:27:52,356 --> 00:27:54,223
Rym: I have played literally all of them.

416
00:27:54,243 --> 00:27:56,089
Scott: I don't know if there was Super Nintendo Wars.

417
00:27:56,751 --> 00:27:59,618
Scott: I have played never seen it if there might be it, but I never seen it.

418
00:27:59,818 --> 00:28:02,033
Rym: I'm not beating them have The?

419
00:28:02,173 --> 00:28:05,230
Scott: actually the Game Boy Color Wars is really fascinating.

420
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,441
Scott: I read an article about it and I've played.

421
00:28:08,461 --> 00:28:16,070
Scott: I've tried to play the ROM of it on my DS lite which has achieved a piracy card and I couldn't figure it out.

422
00:28:16,251 --> 00:28:21,390
Scott: And if you read the article about it, it was really crazy system wise compared to the other ones.

423
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:33,125
Scott: But the first one that came to the US was advanced wars on the GBA on the GBA Which is why it was called advanced wars and then because it was so relatively popular I guess compared to what they expected because it was an older advanced wars.

424
00:28:33,185 --> 00:28:36,670
Rym: It was like a weird Famicom Wars, it was like the special one.

425
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,153
Rym: Well, it was.

426
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:39,990
Scott: I think it was a Game Boy Advance game, but it was called something else.

427
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,339
Rym: Well, cuz it was a Famicom Wars.

428
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:42,790
Rym: We're like all off or what's I got?

429
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:43,355
Rym: It's been so.

430
00:28:43,436 --> 00:28:44,590
Rym: I'll forget some of the character names.

431
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,100
Rym: the one evil dude is dressed up as Santa cuz.

432
00:28:47,120 --> 00:29:00,746
Scott: there's like if you like if you took Parodius the parody Gradius game and and reskinned it to actually be a serious Gradius game and released it as like Gradius in the US instead of you know, but anyway Yeah, there was Olaf.

433
00:29:01,431 --> 00:29:06,570
Rym: Yep, anyway, so I have played literally every one of these games and I have perfect.

434
00:29:06,891 --> 00:29:11,410
Rym: I have unlocked everything gotten every possible s-rank in every one of them.

435
00:29:11,671 --> 00:29:16,329
Scott: I've also played all these games but far less well and far less thoroughly than remes.

436
00:29:16,852 --> 00:29:26,290
Scott: Yeah, I got to the point to weigh less hours like in advanced wars days of ruin Which I would argue like I beat the bosses of them and did not get all s-ranks even though I got some s-ranks.

437
00:29:27,313 --> 00:29:28,175
Scott: You know some s-ranks.

438
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:33,490
Rym: I got to the point where I could beat some like pretty big maps in like three turns with clever bullshit.

439
00:29:34,591 --> 00:29:36,930
Rym: I I love obsessed with these games and I love them, right?

440
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:48,842
Scott: So for a while since Nintendo stopped putting out games in this series I guess entirely because I haven't seen any come out in Japan either Even though the switch would be great for them and the Wii would have been anyway And the DS would have been DS anyway.

441
00:29:51,552 --> 00:29:59,106
Scott: So because Nintendo has stopped this series effectively Many many people especially in the US have been trying to recapture the magic.

442
00:29:59,146 --> 00:30:03,325
Scott: there is a game for iOS It might be on Android also called war bits that I've played.

443
00:30:03,365 --> 00:30:04,250
Scott: I have on my pad.

444
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:08,850
Scott: It's alright, it's it's pretty close to advance wars, but it's just missing something right?

445
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:13,004
Scott: There was that tiny metal and I guess no one even though it came out.

446
00:30:13,085 --> 00:30:14,570
Scott: No one really got that excited about it.

447
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,843
Scott: I seen this one with hexes.

448
00:30:15,944 --> 00:30:16,469
Scott: I played.

449
00:30:17,372 --> 00:30:26,561
Scott: There's like a quite a few turn-based strategy games That all try to capture that advance wars, you know magic thing And none.

450
00:30:26,722 --> 00:30:36,902
Scott: even though some of them Visually came close or mechanically came close or mechanically like super copied advance wars None of them really captured that magic and got people excited.

451
00:30:37,063 --> 00:30:57,030
Scott: even advanced or his fans played them over like Right, yep, so finally this one comes War groove and I'm looking at and I'm like, well, I feel like this is just gonna be another one of those trying to be Advanced wars games that's not advanced wars and is gonna end up in the bin with tiny metal and war bits and all the others.

452
00:30:57,671 --> 00:30:58,854
Scott: You know, how's this gonna go?

453
00:30:58,995 --> 00:30:59,897
Scott: and so far?

454
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:05,150
Scott: I can't say that it's advanced wars, but it's done better than all the other imitators.

455
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:07,639
Scott: So it's like the best Elvis impersonator.

456
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,286
Rym: So I will say I already beat it.

457
00:31:09,306 --> 00:31:10,370
Rym: I've already beaten every mission.

458
00:31:10,892 --> 00:31:13,602
Scott: I've only played like a bunch of a handful of missions.

459
00:31:13,983 --> 00:31:15,870
Rym: I just I beat it as fast as possible.

460
00:31:16,172 --> 00:31:17,521
Scott: I got past the grass people.

461
00:31:17,561 --> 00:31:18,165
Scott: That's about it.

462
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:22,730
Rym: So What I will say is that I've been playing auto chess instead.

463
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:36,010
Rym: That's why if you'll enjoy if you enjoyed advanced wars Particularly the first two advanced wars on the GPA not days of ruin But the like earlier advanced wars in the US favorite ones the DSM with the enemy dual strike.

464
00:31:36,512 --> 00:31:36,853
Rym: That's the.

465
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:41,210
Rym: I think that's the most fun and the most broken one that I enjoyed it the most.

466
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:48,581
Rym: Yeah days of ruin was a better war game, but it wasn't as fun in that Ridiculous way as DS.

467
00:31:49,023 --> 00:31:50,129
Rym: equally good but different.

468
00:31:50,935 --> 00:31:53,130
Rym: Forget days of ruin all the previous advanced wars.

469
00:31:53,612 --> 00:32:07,430
Rym: This is as close as anyone's ever gotten and it is clear the people who made war groove thought a lot about why people liked advanced wars and tried to make a game that Addressed those desires without just cloning advanced wars.

470
00:32:07,951 --> 00:32:13,890
Rym: Like many of the units in the game have a pretty near one-to-one analog with units in advanced wars.

471
00:32:14,071 --> 00:32:14,935
Scott: Yeah, like a knight is.

472
00:32:15,015 --> 00:32:17,910
Scott: obviously it's a fantasy theme instead of a modern military theme.

473
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:19,840
Scott: But it's like yeah a knight is a tank.

474
00:32:20,322 --> 00:32:24,481
Scott: the sketch the regular old Like what's it called the sword man?

475
00:32:24,682 --> 00:32:25,506
Scott: That's an infantry.

476
00:32:25,606 --> 00:32:27,657
Scott: Yeah the pikeman That's a mech.

477
00:32:27,878 --> 00:32:28,401
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

478
00:32:28,421 --> 00:32:29,910
Scott: we know dog is a recon.

479
00:32:30,191 --> 00:32:30,753
Scott: Yeah, you can.

480
00:32:30,834 --> 00:32:39,910
Scott: every mission every unit pretty much has an analog unit Is analogous to a unit in advance wars, but not a whole neo tanks though, really?

481
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,575
Rym: No But it's not a hundred percent.

482
00:32:41,635 --> 00:32:46,792
Rym: because so that some of the units function differently like for example the air units There's a harpy.

483
00:32:47,454 --> 00:32:49,721
Rym: the harpy is arguably the.

484
00:32:49,942 --> 00:32:51,586
Rym: it's like it's across for each.

485
00:32:51,767 --> 00:33:04,630
Scott: It's actually it's not see That's what it's a bad right in advance wars all the different Militaries all have tank or neo tank or medium tank or whatever it is, right helicopter and they function differently and have different stats.

486
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:09,055
Scott: But they're all called the same thing and have the same icon in War bits.

487
00:33:09,257 --> 00:33:16,400
Scott: this different orbits war groove or groove They all have a different theme even though they're the same.

488
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:22,823
Scott: so for example you got the harpy which is the helicopter of the bad Guys, yeah, and then no that's helicopter of the good guys.

489
00:33:23,124 --> 00:33:24,470
Rym: All right, these are good in this game.

490
00:33:24,651 --> 00:33:28,384
Scott: The good guys have the harpy as their helicopter, but on the evil nation, it's the.

491
00:33:28,766 --> 00:33:29,890
Rym: it's the vampires, right?

492
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:32,762
Scott: It's functions the same mostly different stats.

493
00:33:32,903 --> 00:33:33,124
Rym: Nope.

494
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:33,707
Rym: Same stats.

495
00:33:33,988 --> 00:33:34,330
Scott: Oh is it?

496
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:39,086
Rym: Yeah, okay, but the harpy is identical to the vampire is identical to the whatever.

497
00:33:39,547 --> 00:33:40,370
Rym: It's the air unit.

498
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:42,717
Scott: They don't but like there's not like.

499
00:33:42,778 --> 00:33:43,018
Scott: nope.

500
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:44,322
Scott: There's no situation.

501
00:33:44,363 --> 00:33:46,710
Scott: We're like not all those guys are at Sammy.

502
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:51,403
Scott: So the infantry is stronger or that's max of the tanks are stronger zero of that.

503
00:33:52,145 --> 00:33:53,288
Scott: Ah, I didn't realize.

504
00:33:53,308 --> 00:33:55,956
Scott: yeah But they do have a different icon.

505
00:33:56,438 --> 00:33:59,370
Rym: They do have different icons and they do have different animations.

506
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:00,619
Scott: I said animation.

507
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:10,090
Scott: at first I was like, you know They got all these made all these new animations and they're super cute all these nice Graphics that are really cute and well animated even though they're pixely, you know, but advanced wars is pixely.

508
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:10,753
Scott: So that's what they do.

509
00:34:10,813 --> 00:34:12,764
Scott: and right I'm gonna keep these animations on.

510
00:34:12,824 --> 00:34:14,533
Scott: so I'm like, all right I kept them on.

511
00:34:14,674 --> 00:34:15,277
Scott: then they were slow.

512
00:34:15,297 --> 00:34:16,081
Scott: So I made them faster.

513
00:34:16,543 --> 00:34:17,248
Scott: then I turned them off.

514
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:21,262
Rym: Yep I turn them off too, but before I saw them all because it's just.

515
00:34:21,744 --> 00:34:26,449
Rym: but it's interesting because even in advanced wars Like you gotta have them there because they're super cute.

516
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,164
Rym: But anyone who plays the game seriously is gonna turn them all off.

517
00:34:29,304 --> 00:34:31,396
Rym: after they see them all once Let me turn them off.

518
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:31,717
Scott: Good job.

519
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:32,101
Scott: Yep.

520
00:34:32,623 --> 00:34:41,715
Rym: So, uh If I had to give the high-level review like for real if you liked the early advanced wars games up through days up through Dual strike and you

521
00:34:41,735 --> 00:34:45,949
Scott: played them all and don't have any you can't play anymore anymore because you beat them all with s-rank and everything.

522
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:49,463
Rym: These are a 90% like replacement for that.

523
00:34:49,623 --> 00:34:51,230
Rym: They're a full spiritual successor.

524
00:34:51,572 --> 00:34:54,650
Rym: You will enjoy war groove as much as you joined advanced wars.

525
00:34:54,972 --> 00:35:03,670
Rym: It is the combination of that's kind of war gamey But also puzley coupled with really cute characters and that yay war aesthetic.

526
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:08,106
Rym: We're two generals will like have a dialogue of hey, you want to have a battle?

527
00:35:08,146 --> 00:35:09,150
Rym: We haven't fought in a while.

528
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:09,873
Rym: I miss that.

529
00:35:10,134 --> 00:35:19,068
Rym: Yeah, let's have a fight and then you have a war where people fucking die Like all over the place and then at the end the generals like oh man, that was a real good war.

530
00:35:19,188 --> 00:35:24,056
Rym: Yeah Good times It's that it's that combination of the two.

531
00:35:24,076 --> 00:35:25,621
Rym: He's got a pretty simple plot.

532
00:35:26,223 --> 00:35:30,957
Rym: It is it is an advanced wars plot With the square boss, etc.

533
00:35:31,017 --> 00:35:35,190
Rym: Like it follows the formula of advanced wars with anime characters.

534
00:35:35,712 --> 00:35:36,515
Rym: Yeah, it's great.

535
00:35:36,716 --> 00:35:38,182
Rym: If you like advanced wars you like this.

536
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:40,270
Scott: All right, so let's get some nitty-gritty, right?

537
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:44,570
Scott: So some mechanical differences between this and advanced wars that I noticed that are good and bad.

538
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:47,060
Scott: The number one is the critical hits.

539
00:35:47,401 --> 00:35:55,050
Scott: that is but by far the Thing that I would say should even be added to advance or as good as it is such a good idea.

540
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:59,990
Scott: The way it works is each unit, you know does its normal damage when it attacks and fights.

541
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:04,810
Scott: You know the advantage to the attacker like in advance wars, even though I think it might be even in greater advantage.

542
00:36:05,551 --> 00:36:08,450
Rym: Definitely feels like it's well in general more groove.

543
00:36:08,611 --> 00:36:13,820
Rym: So in war groove if I had to because I'm actually gonna do well I've been live-streaming myself playing the game again.

544
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,925
Rym: I bought it on switch.

545
00:36:14,945 --> 00:36:16,130
Rym: I beat it on switch now.

546
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:20,330
Rym: I bought it on steam so I gotta beat it again on steam so I can see the whole thing cross play.

547
00:36:20,832 --> 00:36:28,376
Scott: so the only reason not to buy it on switch or steam or whatever platform is best for you is I bought it on steam just because.

548
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:34,929
Scott: but the only reason not to do that is because if you're worried that in 15 years They're gonna close the switch e-shop and you'll lose your game.

549
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:38,664
Rym: Yep, but I bought it on a switch because I wanted to play it portably.

550
00:36:38,684 --> 00:36:40,250
Rym: Yeah, then I beat it like immediately.

551
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:43,828
Scott: I might re-buy it on iOS if it comes out in iOS.

552
00:36:44,109 --> 00:36:49,410
Rym: No but So yeah, I'll be streaming it and talking about the detail.

553
00:36:49,691 --> 00:36:51,095
Scott: So the point is critical hits.

554
00:36:51,436 --> 00:36:55,590
Rym: but critical hits are part of a series of changes that all do the same thing.

555
00:36:56,051 --> 00:37:10,530
Rym: They give a little bit of an advantage to the person who's taking risks being aggressive and attacking to avoid static fronts and the kinds of Static degenerate strategies that will rule the day in advance wars if you are a jerk who is highly skilled, right?

556
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:11,955
Scott: So for example critical hits.

557
00:37:11,975 --> 00:37:15,590
Scott: the way they work is so each unit has a different way to critical hit.

558
00:37:16,051 --> 00:37:17,575
Scott: So this pike man is the simplest.

559
00:37:17,816 --> 00:37:23,888
Scott: if a pike man attacks while standing orthogonally adjacent to another pike man That is on your team.

560
00:37:24,351 --> 00:37:30,709
Scott: It will do more damage than normal like a lot more damage like a hundred and fifty percent Like a shit ton more, right?

561
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:35,210
Scott: So each unit has a different way of scoring a critical hit like the basic sword man.

562
00:37:35,771 --> 00:37:42,010
Scott: If the basic sword man attacks while standing orthogonally adjacent to your commander unit, it will do crazy more damage.

563
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:56,730
Scott: No, if a dog recon attacks a unit while you have another recon orthogonally adjacent to The unit that you're attacking it's like you're flanking, you know, this this guy with your your recon does way more damage.

564
00:37:56,934 --> 00:37:57,510
Scott: Yep, all right.

565
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,930
Scott: So each unit and they get clever like battleships.

566
00:38:00,432 --> 00:38:05,970
Rym: They do two more damage if they're on the beach because they're intended to attack the land like bombardment.

567
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:15,520
Scott: Yeah the knight does more damage if you attack something at maximum range and it does a Charges the full distance it can charge and then hits again.

568
00:38:15,701 --> 00:38:28,350
Rym: Now, that's the only one I don't like because while I could Take advantage of that I'm not willing to put that much effort into making sure your nights at theory figure out where will be my opponent be next turn.

569
00:38:28,691 --> 00:38:32,185
Scott: I will put my night exactly six seven, whatever spaces away.

570
00:38:32,205 --> 00:38:33,290
Rym: I'm not willing to do that.

571
00:38:33,751 --> 00:38:35,116
Scott: Yeah, I'm willing to move.

572
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:45,690
Rym: if I have 40 units on the board and I'm one turn away from victory I'll still move all 40 toward my goal just in case but I am not willing to make sure my Knights always hitting at six.

573
00:38:45,813 --> 00:38:57,490
Scott: Yeah anyway Another major change from advance Wars Is that an advance was when you capture buildings you stand on them and sort of stomp on them until you convert them here to conquer buildings.

574
00:38:58,491 --> 00:39:01,103
Scott: You state you can't stand on top of any building.

575
00:39:01,123 --> 00:39:02,710
Scott: You can only attack it from the side.

576
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:12,426
Scott: So if you attack like an enemy city, it sort of defends itself a little bit and shoots back at you and then to capture it once it's neutral you just walk up next to it and then capture it.

577
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:19,046
Scott: and Almost any land unit can sort of attack the cities, but only certain ones can capture.

578
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:20,530
Scott: and it's a little bit different.

579
00:39:21,516 --> 00:39:27,661
Scott: And as a result the bases, you know The barracks that build units since nothing can be on top of a building.

580
00:39:28,082 --> 00:39:35,030
Scott: when you build a guy you choose which of the four Orthogonally adjacent spaces that guy will appear in and that doesn't matter too much.

581
00:39:35,493 --> 00:39:41,447
Scott: Usually you do it in the most forward position But I guess when the fighting is near the barracks that can matter a shit ton.

582
00:39:41,688 --> 00:39:47,580
Rym: No So There are other subtle changes like fog.

583
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,483
Scott: Those are the biggest one.

584
00:39:48,503 --> 00:39:50,550
Rym: Yes fog of war works kind of differently.

585
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:54,750
Rym: I don't like it that much but it's it's barely used at all in the entire campaign, right?

586
00:39:54,890 --> 00:40:00,650
Scott: You're the commander is at is instead of just being this vague, you know character is actually a unit on the board.

587
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:01,473
Scott: That's way strong.

588
00:40:01,514 --> 00:40:04,627
Rym: you start with it, which is similar to what days of ruin does.

589
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:08,944
Rym: but in days of ruin You can put your commander in a regular unit right it died.

590
00:40:09,105 --> 00:40:12,612
Scott: if it dies you lose When it fights in You.

591
00:40:12,633 --> 00:40:14,630
Scott: so you think oh if it dies, I lose.

592
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:21,350
Scott: I'll just keep it back safe near my HQ, but no if it fights and gets in the mix That's how you build up your power meter.

593
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:30,242
Scott: And then the commander unit itself is the one that actually executes the special move In its near or on its location on the map.

594
00:40:30,423 --> 00:40:30,643
Rym: Yep.

595
00:40:30,663 --> 00:40:32,470
Rym: So the commanders only have a local effect.

596
00:40:32,571 --> 00:40:34,243
Rym: So it's sort of like this powerful unit.

597
00:40:34,263 --> 00:40:38,229
Scott: Yeah, there's nothing like Andy heal all my units on the whole fucking board.

598
00:40:38,391 --> 00:40:40,950
Scott: Yeah, like heal all the units close to my commander.

599
00:40:41,292 --> 00:40:45,270
Scott: And the only way you can even get that power is if the commander goes around fighting.

600
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:49,230
Scott: So you got to get this unit in the mix fighting, but always keep it safe.

601
00:40:49,431 --> 00:40:52,208
Scott: I've lost a lot of missions including against Rym.

602
00:40:52,348 --> 00:40:54,214
Rym: Yeah That live stream.

603
00:40:54,314 --> 00:41:00,210
Scott: I was basically dominating or almost sure to win against the computer or Rym and then just one turn.

604
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:07,450
Scott: I moved my commander into a stupid spot without Realizing how badly it can be damaged in that spot and it dies and I lose even though I was totally winning.

605
00:41:07,992 --> 00:41:15,161
Scott: So I feel like what you want to do is you want to get your commander in the mix on pretty much most things and use that power when you need to.

606
00:41:15,623 --> 00:41:20,141
Scott: but if you're ahead and You don't need the commander and the power in the mix.

607
00:41:20,483 --> 00:41:21,789
Scott: Just pull it back and be safe.

608
00:41:21,932 --> 00:41:27,970
Scott: Yep Surrounded with four pikemen high corner as soon as you're ahead and winning and you feel like you can roll the rest of the map.

609
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,336
Scott: But just your regular units.

610
00:41:29,899 --> 00:41:31,546
Scott: just pull the commander away from the scene.

611
00:41:31,928 --> 00:41:33,498
Scott: the commander You only need it early.

612
00:41:33,518 --> 00:41:35,250
Scott: or if you're behind you don't need it.

613
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:37,578
Scott: If you're ahead play conservatively and hide the dude.

614
00:41:37,919 --> 00:41:46,190
Rym: now like advanced wars playing playing in the arcade Equivalent like playing in like a symmetric map against the AI or playing against a human.

615
00:41:46,732 --> 00:41:51,047
Rym: The strategies are very different from what you will do in the campaign because the campaign there's often tricks.

616
00:41:51,127 --> 00:41:51,910
Rym: It's asymmetric.

617
00:41:52,151 --> 00:41:55,240
Rym: There's like a mission like there's escort missions and all sorts of nonsense.

618
00:41:55,581 --> 00:41:58,290
Rym: So they're very different but the campaign is real fun.

619
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:00,899
Rym: It's as fun as an advanced wars campaign.

620
00:42:00,939 --> 00:42:02,826
Rym: The missions are pretty varied.

621
00:42:03,147 --> 00:42:09,587
Rym: There are only Two annoying missions in the entire campaign and there are both side missions.

622
00:42:10,029 --> 00:42:10,410
Scott: Oh, that's good.

623
00:42:10,723 --> 00:42:12,094
Rym: Yeah You can just skip them if you want.

624
00:42:12,355 --> 00:42:19,689
Rym: they're annoying because they're kind of like a lot of the campaign feels like the campaign of the first GBA advanced wars that came to the US.

625
00:42:20,354 --> 00:42:22,250
Rym: They're that level of like puzzle.

626
00:42:23,012 --> 00:42:29,306
Rym: the only difference is in advanced wars games the campaign is a little bit tighter in that there is all.

627
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:33,820
Rym: there is always like One particular trick you can do like.

628
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:38,689
Rym: there's always a clever way to beat the map Sammy usually Yep, and the normal way to beat the map.

629
00:42:39,471 --> 00:42:42,528
Rym: There's pretty much only the normal way to meet the bat beat the map.

630
00:42:42,548 --> 00:42:49,180
Rym: in this game Like you might see interesting terrain features and you might think oh Maybe there's a clever way to like send a guy around the walls.

631
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,867
Rym: now that never works in this game.

632
00:42:50,907 --> 00:42:53,781
Rym: Don't even try it Yeah, but against the human it'll work.

633
00:42:54,042 --> 00:42:55,249
Rym: Well again Scott it'll work.

634
00:42:57,439 --> 00:43:00,441
Scott: You Know there's other small differences you'll notice.

635
00:43:00,481 --> 00:43:05,497
Scott: like the wagon is a little more opie Oh God, so the APC is the wagon is the APC.

636
00:43:06,058 --> 00:43:09,467
Scott: it moves so far also your unit can get.

637
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:10,550
Scott: so in advanced wars.

638
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:13,022
Scott: I'm pretty sure Rym will correct me if I'm wrong.

639
00:43:13,363 --> 00:43:14,609
Scott: to get a unit into an APC.

640
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,524
Scott: Let's say an infantry moves three, right?

641
00:43:16,564 --> 00:43:16,806
Scott: Sorry.

642
00:43:17,169 --> 00:43:20,057
Scott: Yep they then the APC must be three away.

643
00:43:20,137 --> 00:43:26,112
Scott: so the infantry ends its turn on top of the APC to enter it in the Wargroove.

644
00:43:26,654 --> 00:43:41,221
Scott: the infantry can move three and then if the wagon is one more space away You can effectively get one free hex square of movement because the infantry will sort of jump into the adjacent wagon and then you can get a free movement at the end.

645
00:43:41,302 --> 00:43:46,390
Scott: obviously when it jumps out and Also, the wagon feels like it moves way farther than the APC moved.

646
00:43:46,492 --> 00:43:52,353
Rym: Yep so when like in regular advanced wars one of the one of the things a pro would do like the way you Need to have

647
00:43:52,373 --> 00:43:52,413
Scott: if

648
00:43:52,955 --> 00:44:05,232
Rym: you have a certain number of infantry you need to move you can use a Smaller number of APCs in conjunction with infantry by shuttling and moving in a correct way Even though you're not moving APCs the full distance they could move.

649
00:44:05,593 --> 00:44:10,648
Rym: you can move a bunch of infantry together faster than any of them could move on their own.

650
00:44:10,668 --> 00:44:15,550
Rym: and It's it's like this complicated trick you can pull off and it gets more complicated the more units you move.

651
00:44:16,293 --> 00:44:20,150
Rym: That doesn't exist in this game because the APC moves so goddamn far.

652
00:44:20,612 --> 00:44:24,988
Rym: You literally can just move someone all the way to the other side of the map and you sort of need to right.

653
00:44:25,028 --> 00:44:31,076
Scott: because the Limiting thing in this game is that when you capture cities they give you money, but if you capture barracks They don't give you money.

654
00:44:31,096 --> 00:44:33,650
Scott: yep, so you capture all the cities to get money.

655
00:44:34,153 --> 00:44:40,710
Scott: But most of the maps I've played in the campaign even though It's mostly early campaign all the there's not a lot of barracks on these maps.

656
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:46,850
Scott: There's a map editor where you can make different maps But the barracks are near your HQ and there aren't a lot that are out in the field.

657
00:44:47,294 --> 00:44:58,770
Scott: So the result is that you end up You know building guys moving him towards the front and then it takes a long Supply chain to get more guys to the front yo, and then unless you got a wagon to get them up there, right?

658
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:03,350
Scott: So speaking and you can you're really limited on how many guys you can make each turn.

659
00:45:03,792 --> 00:45:06,529
Scott: You're using that wagon to get them up to the front all the time.

660
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:12,086
Rym: So speaking of supply chain one other major difference is there's no concept of unit fuel.

661
00:45:12,527 --> 00:45:12,908
Scott: Oh, yeah.

662
00:45:12,928 --> 00:45:13,550
Scott: I forgot about that.

663
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:17,999
Rym: So APCs are less valuable than they would be in advanced wars.

664
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:21,430
Rym: cuz advanced wars you use the APC to fuel units up.

665
00:45:21,932 --> 00:45:28,640
Rym: Yep in this game if you build a witch which is the equivalent of a fighter Just fucking fly around forever people forget it.

666
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,608
Scott: like there's a lot of stuff for you.

667
00:45:30,628 --> 00:45:31,150
Scott: think of advanced.

668
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:31,711
Scott: Where did you think?

669
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,476
Scott: oh simple turn-based strategy game.

670
00:45:33,516 --> 00:45:39,736
Scott: advanced wars had two complicated like you know a few complicated tricks things going on With mostly the fuel.

671
00:45:40,017 --> 00:45:43,775
Scott: that fuel system was kind of a complicated Advanced kind of thing.

672
00:45:43,815 --> 00:45:47,070
Rym: Yeah bill like you got a fighter jets flying around you got to refuel them.

673
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:50,380
Rym: It's like combat air patrol refuel and re-ammo your stuff.

674
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,790
Scott: So like, you know, it's like you had the fuel and ammo for all these units.

675
00:45:54,031 --> 00:45:57,830
Scott: It's like you send out your tank to the field and suddenly you can't do anything out there.

676
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:00,175
Scott: It's got to come back Even if it hasn't been damaged.

677
00:46:00,577 --> 00:46:03,768
Scott: and also there were a lot of weird like people a lot of people in advanced wars.

678
00:46:03,808 --> 00:46:04,290
Scott: don't remember.

679
00:46:04,774 --> 00:46:16,745
Scott: You can put the helicopter on the destroyer Anything else on it But you can use a destroyer to move a helicopter way far and then it hops out and it's like, you know It's such a tiny tiny thing, but it's a real thing.

680
00:46:16,765 --> 00:46:17,930
Scott: There's nothing like that in war group.

681
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:18,554
Scott: There's no fuel.

682
00:46:18,574 --> 00:46:20,747
Scott: your night can just go around stabbing things forever.

683
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:25,846
Rym: Yep But what the game does kind of better than most advanced wars.

684
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,134
Rym: the only advanced wars that did this Well was days of ruin.

685
00:46:28,956 --> 00:46:30,562
Rym: all the other advanced wars did this poorly.

686
00:46:30,943 --> 00:46:46,344
Rym: this game has made sure that Navy's Like naval combat matters a lot in Conjunction with land combat if the if the map has me if the map has it But in the sense that naval units aren't just rock-paper-scissors among themselves.

687
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:56,330
Rym: It's actually much more complex than that and Naval units are sort of designed with the purpose of coming in like bombarding the shore and everything else is to protect the bombardment units.

688
00:46:56,671 --> 00:47:00,544
Rym: It's a different dynamic than advanced wars that meant that and then early advanced wars.

689
00:47:00,564 --> 00:47:02,230
Rym: that makes naval combat interesting, right?

690
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:06,270
Scott: I mean there was some of that in advance wars because the battleship could do some series.

691
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:08,863
Rym: It was pointless though until days of ruin.

692
00:47:08,883 --> 00:47:10,190
Rym: Navy stuff was just bullshit.

693
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:19,948
Scott: But the battleship could do serious bombardment, but you just had you just build rockets - yeah Hey, they're almost as good right like a lot cheaper.

694
00:47:19,969 --> 00:47:28,068
Rym: in Advanced wars up until days of ruin the land theater and the sea theater tended to be separate from one another.

695
00:47:28,088 --> 00:47:31,600
Scott: in this game You can get a little bit anti-air in the sea.

696
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:31,982
Scott: it's also.

697
00:47:32,022 --> 00:47:35,229
Scott: the map design matters a lot, right You know, you could make an advanced wars map.

698
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:35,955
Scott: We're like guess what?

699
00:47:35,975 --> 00:47:38,110
Scott: It's a big fucking ocean between you and the other guy.

700
00:47:38,911 --> 00:47:41,621
Scott: Deal with it and suddenly the Navy theater matters.

701
00:47:41,661 --> 00:47:43,830
Rym: You haven't seen the naval units yet, but you'll see what I mean.

702
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:44,171
Rym: There's an.

703
00:47:44,352 --> 00:47:45,376
Scott: I use them in a multiplayer.

704
00:47:45,497 --> 00:47:48,770
Scott: There's a Navy infantry and oh, I didn't know that.

705
00:47:48,931 --> 00:47:53,170
Rym: Yeah, and there's naval cities that are their own cities that can only be captured by Navy infantry.

706
00:47:54,401 --> 00:47:58,990
Rym: Yeah Believe me when you get the Navy, you'll see I don't want to spend a ton of time on it right now.

707
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:07,730
Rym: But if you watch my live streams I'm going to literally make a video of every single map in this game and me beating it because I already beat it.

708
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:15,690
Scott: Yeah, the one thing that this has against every advance wars regardless of his quality is that it has online multiplayer crossplay between platforms.

709
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:16,654
Rym: It just works.

710
00:48:16,754 --> 00:48:18,742
Scott: totally seems to work just fine.

711
00:48:18,822 --> 00:48:20,930
Scott: We tried it a couple times and it worked mostly.

712
00:48:21,872 --> 00:48:22,153
Scott: And you.

713
00:48:22,173 --> 00:48:24,203
Scott: it's like one person on the switch one person on Steam.

714
00:48:24,223 --> 00:48:25,550
Scott: you play against each other and you're good.

715
00:48:26,292 --> 00:48:30,384
Rym: I am more than willing to get some multiplayer games going online with listeners.

716
00:48:30,645 --> 00:48:32,190
Rym: Yeah, like that's something I want to do.

717
00:48:33,751 --> 00:48:39,510
Rym: So anything else to say about live war groove unless I start getting into the like deep deep details of specific units.

718
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:42,086
Scott: We went into this the mildly deep details.

719
00:48:42,106 --> 00:48:42,610
Scott: I think that's enough.

720
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:52,921
Rym: Yeah, this game like seriously if you've never played an advanced wars game just play this Works on a modern platform and you can see the deal.

721
00:48:53,402 --> 00:49:05,349
Rym: if you enjoy this you should basically start working Backward through the advanced wars games in reverse chronological order of release Because they're not as good the older they get but they're still good.

722
00:49:05,731 --> 00:49:06,212
Rym: But play it.

723
00:49:06,233 --> 00:49:09,424
Rym: starting like if you like this game go play all the advanced wars games.

724
00:49:09,624 --> 00:49:11,070
Rym: if you're desperate for more advanced wars.

725
00:49:11,351 --> 00:49:14,040
Rym: Wargroove is so close fancy side note.

726
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:21,844
Scott: If you're interested in programming and making video games They just released like today or yesterday the engine for this war groove.

727
00:49:21,964 --> 00:49:23,790
Scott: It's called like Wally or something like that.

728
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:27,904
Rym: Oh, yeah, you sent me a link to that right the source code for the engine.

729
00:49:27,984 --> 00:49:30,935
Scott: not the source code for war groove But the source code for the engine.

730
00:49:30,975 --> 00:49:31,919
Scott: war groove is made on.

731
00:49:31,939 --> 00:49:37,178
Scott: it's a c++ game engine was put on github So you can take that engine there.

732
00:49:37,398 --> 00:49:39,405
Scott: The documentation is like being filled in.

733
00:49:39,525 --> 00:49:41,170
Scott: but you know, what's there is good documentation.

734
00:49:41,251 --> 00:49:42,370
Scott: It's just incomplete.

735
00:49:43,691 --> 00:49:49,210
Scott: And start making a game that is you know cross-platform and has network stack and the graphics and the audio.

736
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:51,859
Scott: It's got all the pieces you need to make a modern game.

737
00:49:52,502 --> 00:49:53,726
Scott: It might even be a good choice.

738
00:49:53,806 --> 00:49:54,629
Scott: I think yeah.

739
00:49:55,294 --> 00:49:56,584
Scott: So, you know check that out.

740
00:49:56,685 --> 00:49:57,290
Scott: game developers.

741
00:49:57,634 --> 00:49:59,149
Rym: Oh, and I won't go through all the details now.

742
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:04,688
Rym: But there's already a major patch coming to the game because Chucklefish the company that made it.

743
00:50:04,728 --> 00:50:05,210
Rym: they're pretty.

744
00:50:05,732 --> 00:50:10,170
Rym: They seem pretty invested both in sequels and in supporting this game hard.

745
00:50:10,692 --> 00:50:19,107
Rym: So there is a giant patch that has a ton of quality of life Improvements things like adding CPU players to online multiplayer games.

746
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:24,864
Rym: good idea Preventing the problem where you can accidentally end your turn by double-clicking too quickly.

747
00:50:24,884 --> 00:50:25,326
Scott: that happens.

748
00:50:25,366 --> 00:50:27,597
Rym: a lot happened to me Playing against Scott.

749
00:50:27,617 --> 00:50:28,805
Rym: that almost caused me to lose.

750
00:50:29,087 --> 00:50:35,507
Rym: Yep they're fixing some problems with fog of war and They're changing the difficulty system.

751
00:50:36,351 --> 00:50:40,844
Rym: They're adding a checkpoint system which would have been real nice for some of the later missions.

752
00:50:41,145 --> 00:50:42,890
Rym: Yep, but yeah, they're all.

753
00:50:43,631 --> 00:50:44,833
Scott: Wait for that before I finish the game.

754
00:50:44,953 --> 00:50:52,990
Rym: You probably should because the last mission in this game is The same as the last mission in every Advance Wars game.

755
00:50:53,030 --> 00:51:02,098
Scott: It's just an enormous map with an enormous man with ridiculous bullshit and a very specific Conceit and a boss that does like it drops bombs on all your shit all the time.

756
00:51:02,118 --> 00:51:08,714
Rym: Yep, and you have no Regular units, it's only hero like only commanders on your team.

757
00:51:09,015 --> 00:51:10,300
Scott: Oh, that's the last map.

758
00:51:10,621 --> 00:51:13,776
Scott: So it's sort of like one of those Warcraft maps where it's like in you.

759
00:51:13,796 --> 00:51:16,892
Scott: instead of building a base You just moved this tiny troop of dudes around.

760
00:51:16,993 --> 00:51:19,604
Rym: Yeah, something like that It was moderately.

761
00:51:19,644 --> 00:51:21,791
Rym: it took me about seven tries to actually beat.

762
00:51:21,971 --> 00:51:22,152
Scott: Hmm.

763
00:51:22,473 --> 00:51:23,255
Scott: I mean, I'm sure it's beat up.

764
00:51:23,335 --> 00:51:24,800
Scott: Oh, that's what matters, right?

765
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:28,040
Rym: Yep, I beat it in seven or eight tries without a checkpoint system.

766
00:51:28,301 --> 00:51:35,559
Rym: Okay, basically the first two moves of it were annoying like the first two days But if you got past that you could just like steamroll the rest of it.

767
00:51:36,642 --> 00:51:37,606
Rym: So yeah, it's really good.

768
00:51:37,646 --> 00:51:39,534
Rym: It's really fun and you should all play it.

769
00:51:39,614 --> 00:51:40,799
