00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:09,560
Rym:

2
00:00:09,772 --> 00:00:11,338
Rym: It's Monday March 5th.

3
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:12,281
Scott: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:12,602 --> 00:00:14,588
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:19,090
Rym: tonight We're gonna talk a bit about network address translation aka nets.

6
00:00:20,152 --> 00:00:21,187
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,173 --> 00:00:23,880
Scott: So Rym at your work.

8
00:00:24,322 --> 00:00:26,310
Scott: How many people use delicious?

9
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:29,741
Rym: I don't think a single person at my company even knows what delicious is.

10
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:33,234
Rym: to be perfectly honest my coworker used delicious Not bad.

11
00:00:33,274 --> 00:00:36,726
Scott: He made little delicious friends today actually even at IBM.

12
00:00:36,767 --> 00:00:37,690
Rym: No one really knew about it.

13
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:41,261
Rym: I showed people delicious and usually the response was either.

14
00:00:41,783 --> 00:00:47,017
Rym: Why would I do that when I have bookmarks or That's a weird URL or huh?

15
00:00:47,078 --> 00:00:48,081
Scott: I didn't even say anything.

16
00:00:48,161 --> 00:00:50,670
Scott: my coworker was just like yes something delicious something something.

17
00:00:51,293 --> 00:00:52,761
Rym: Actually two or three days ago.

18
00:00:52,781 --> 00:00:55,835
Rym: I was at work like Friday was Friday Might have been Thursday doesn't matter.

19
00:00:56,498 --> 00:00:59,750
Rym: and I said like my coworker was asking me about some Excel crap.

20
00:01:00,132 --> 00:01:06,063
Rym: so I just said oh, I delicious something about that a while ago and He didn't know how to respond to that.

21
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,852
Scott: I Delicious.

22
00:01:08,474 --> 00:01:10,681
Scott: it's like I googled something something they could.

23
00:01:10,702 --> 00:01:13,210
Scott: I think they understand googled, but they don't understand delicious.

24
00:01:13,694 --> 00:01:24,930
Rym: Yeah, but lately more and more at my job But I love conversations with people and if I try to say The word like I use words that I use in my normal daily life that you know my real life outside of work.

25
00:01:25,495 --> 00:01:30,849
Rym: those words end Conversations at my job like people just don't understand them.

26
00:01:32,513 --> 00:01:33,778
Scott: On another note at work.

27
00:01:33,818 --> 00:01:34,942
Scott: I've got this computer.

28
00:01:35,123 --> 00:01:36,790
Scott: I don't know if I said that I say this last week.

29
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:38,539
Scott: No, cuz I didn't work yet last week.

30
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,010
Scott: Yeah, I'm at my new job now It is a new job, and I have a computer at this new job.

31
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,178
Scott: It's Adele But it has a core to duo.

32
00:01:47,339 --> 00:01:51,314
Scott: and I will say this core to duo is the fastest computer I have ever used.

33
00:01:51,455 --> 00:01:53,201
Rym: didn't you start work Thursday last week.

34
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:59,130
Scott: That's what I said, and we did a show Thursday night Yeah, but it wasn't like a Monday show so I didn't talk a lot about technology.

35
00:02:01,053 --> 00:02:11,249
Scott: Anyway, this is so fast this computer, but the problem is it's got an Intel video card Which is fine because Intel video cards are open source, and they're drivers for them.

36
00:02:11,712 --> 00:02:20,102
Scott: but the driver for this one is in kernel 2 6 18 and I'm using Ubuntu edgy, which is kernel 2 6 17.

37
00:02:20,102 --> 00:02:21,266
Rym: so just use our feisty.

38
00:02:21,788 --> 00:02:23,098
Scott: Yeah, right That's what I'm gonna do.

39
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,190
Scott: my can work computer.

40
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,665
Scott: I'm gonna have it crashing left and right with unstable ass in development.

41
00:02:27,685 --> 00:02:28,308
Scott: feisty fawn.

42
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:28,850
Scott: That's a good idea.

43
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,603
Rym: How unstable is feisty by now pretty unstable?

44
00:02:31,744 --> 00:02:32,347
Rym: How do you know?

45
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:32,990
Scott: all right?

46
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,749
Scott: You use it for your daily life and see what happens.

47
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:37,301
Rym: I don't have any computer to put it on.

48
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:38,349
Scott: you can use that one right there.

49
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,814
Rym: What my computer?

50
00:02:39,874 --> 00:02:42,383
Scott: no the one that has edgy on it right in front of you.

51
00:02:42,403 --> 00:02:43,406
Rym: now cuz I need that one.

52
00:02:43,426 --> 00:02:48,829
Scott: ah I need my work computer more than you need that computer.

53
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:51,122
Rym: now I think I need this one more than you need your work computer.

54
00:02:51,142 --> 00:02:52,530
Scott: Yeah, that's not true, but anyway.

55
00:02:53,451 --> 00:02:55,441
Scott: So an Nvidia video card is the answer.

56
00:02:55,521 --> 00:03:01,288
Scott: so to make the long story short We got the Nvidia video card cuz my work was smart, and they just bought it on Newegg.

57
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:02,292
Scott: well It's a smart work.

58
00:03:02,352 --> 00:03:06,065
Rym: I'm at they got my work didn't know that Newegg existed.

59
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:11,545
Rym: like they needed computer parts And I said why don't you just go on Newegg, and they said what I said.

60
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:12,690
Rym: Newegg what?

61
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,974
Rym: New egg?

62
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,241
Rym: calm so it's an online store.

63
00:03:17,401 --> 00:03:18,846
Rym: Yeah, what was that URL?

64
00:03:18,886 --> 00:03:20,049
Rym: again Newegg?

65
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:22,285
Rym: You mean like a new egg?

66
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:27,770
Scott: Yes, everyone knows Newegg doesn't pay us money to advertise for them.

67
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,549
Scott: We pay them money to give us the computer parts that we use to tell you about them.

68
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:42,818
Rym: well I used to use egghead, and then I use And then I used Newegg and TC computers and now I just use Newegg.

69
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:50,570
Scott: if you want to get rims money and Exchange for parts of computers make sure your store has the word egg in the name.

70
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:56,359
Rym: Well, I did just eat an egg the last egg in the house in fact right I fried it in bacon grease any must know.

71
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,175
Scott: in the course of installing this Nvidia video card I learned about a few things.

72
00:04:00,235 --> 00:04:03,085
Scott: I learned what a PCI Express 16 slot looks like.

73
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:03,667
Rym: it's little.

74
00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:04,490
Scott: It's real little.

75
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,977
Scott: I learned what low-profile card means.

76
00:04:07,057 --> 00:04:10,286
Scott: they're little yep, and I opened up a Dell for the.

77
00:04:10,687 --> 00:04:19,241
Scott: I was opening up this Dell Which is really thin and quiet, and I expected that when I opened it There'd be a mess inside and be a horrible nightmare of a case to deal with.

78
00:04:19,422 --> 00:04:29,810
Scott: you know like old Dells or gateways or any Open up like a Packard Bell computer from like 1997 that's a freaking hell frickin god damn.

79
00:04:30,252 --> 00:04:33,267
Scott: You might as well just throw the computer out because it's less painful than opening it.

80
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:43,008
Rym: yeah We actually did throw away a Hewlett Packard Bell that we had because while it was functional We needed to add RAM to it, and we couldn't get to the RAM right.

81
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:47,276
Rym: so then I wanted to take the RAM out and salvage it and I couldn't get to it And it wasn't worth it.

82
00:04:47,297 --> 00:04:56,306
Scott: because the cases on those things are Disastrous and I think that actually the modern HPS I look at them, and I'm pretty sure they're also disastrous, but I'm not a hundred percent sure.

83
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,897
Scott: but this Dell I opened it up, and it was very nice.

84
00:04:59,978 --> 00:05:08,065
Scott: It was quiet, and there was easy access to everything and Everything was arranged nicely and it was pretty good.

85
00:05:08,085 --> 00:05:17,250
Scott: I was huh it Beat expectations that actually depending on the price you know and what I can get I mean that computer was fast enough.

86
00:05:17,832 --> 00:05:23,530
Rym: Well I always whenever I make a computer a lot of people have a prejudice against pre-built machines And I don't have any innate prejudice.

87
00:05:23,731 --> 00:05:29,822
Rym: I just I always get whatever is the best deal for the you know the money of whatever I want to buy Performance power all that stuff.

88
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:30,870
Scott: yeah, I'm the same way.

89
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,630
Rym: I always compare the Dell or the Gateway or whatever to whatever I can build on my own.

90
00:05:35,731 --> 00:05:44,122
Rym: And it's just every time I built a computer Whatever I built on my own was four times faster and half the money, but now yeah I've always done the same exact thing.

91
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:46,073
Scott: you know if I buy a computer I say all right.

92
00:05:46,134 --> 00:05:47,238
Scott: How much did I buy it pay?

93
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:48,885
Scott: how much would it cost me to get this computer?

94
00:05:48,885 --> 00:05:49,006
Scott: 1500, okay?

95
00:05:50,511 --> 00:05:53,171
Scott: Let's see the Dell what Dell is selling for 1500.

96
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:58,992
Scott: Let's see what HP is selling for 1500 and it's always slower than what I've just bought for 1500.

97
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,802
Scott: You know even if I click customize and get exactly what I want.

98
00:06:01,922 --> 00:06:02,063
Scott: so

99
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:15,869
Rym: what I might do because I've considered this before In the Pentium three days and was almost worth it like it was on the edge of being worth it buy the pre-made computer that comes with a really nice monitor and the nice video card and all that stuff and Then take all those parts out.

100
00:06:16,331 --> 00:06:18,019
Rym: Scrap whatever motherboard they give you.

101
00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:20,610
Rym: buy a real a bit motherboard then put the computer back together.

102
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:25,166
Scott: Yeah, see actually the nice thing about this computer was that everything was arranged.

103
00:06:25,266 --> 00:06:26,330
Scott: It was like a weird motherboard.

104
00:06:26,371 --> 00:06:28,749
Scott: I had no idea what the hell motherboard It was some Dell thing.

105
00:06:29,392 --> 00:06:38,669
Scott: But it worked and everything was arranged in this nice fashion that allowed it to be quiet and small and yeah And there wasn't a lot of room to expand though.

106
00:06:39,193 --> 00:06:42,110
Scott: So there was no way you were gonna fit more than like one more hard drive in there.

107
00:06:42,752 --> 00:06:43,355
Rym: Yeah, that's though.

108
00:06:43,395 --> 00:06:44,279
Rym: I mean the computer.

109
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,287
Rym: I got now the old you know year 2000 beast.

110
00:06:47,596 --> 00:06:53,376
Rym: I got the biggest tower I could get because I expected over the course of my life to fill this thing with drives And I pretty much have.

111
00:06:53,396 --> 00:06:56,330
Rym: there's four hard drives in there, and I've got room for like seven more.

112
00:06:56,471 --> 00:07:00,515
Scott: Yeah, I think that is the one thing that would actually keep me from Considering buying.

113
00:07:00,595 --> 00:07:03,950
Scott: one of these things is that there's not a lot of room to expand.

114
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:08,608
Rym: But then again if we have a SAN we don't need any expansion where we don't need more hard drives.

115
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:09,693
Rym: It's true It's true.

116
00:07:09,774 --> 00:07:10,941
Scott: I mean a NAS not a SAN.

117
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:11,887
Scott: we can't afford a SAN.

118
00:07:12,109 --> 00:07:13,915
Rym: yeah I'm just thinking there's a SAN.

119
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:22,133
Scott: I like how SAN and NAS are both storage computer things, but they're it's exact reverse acronym We need.

120
00:07:22,153 --> 00:07:26,610
Rym: we need like a two exabyte SAN with fiber connections in this house sounds good.

121
00:07:27,232 --> 00:07:38,165
Scott: The last thing I got to say is that that laptop that I ordered on February like 12th like the middle of last month Finally shipped today although they haven't taken my money yet some.

122
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:40,212
Scott: maybe it's gonna be free I don't know.

123
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:42,159
Rym: Maybe they didn't actually ship it.

124
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:48,990
Scott: it says shipped on the website and yesterday it said Expected ship date today, so I'll believe that website.

125
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:52,842
Scott: So yeah if anyone's considering buying a laptop.

126
00:07:53,565 --> 00:08:00,470
Scott: I if you want it soon I recommend you do not order it from the manufacturer's website, especially if the manufacturer is Fujitsu.

127
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:04,140
Scott: I will comment on the quality of their laptops probably next week.

128
00:08:05,002 --> 00:08:10,139
Rym: So in the news everyone's favorite company is Finally doing something smart.

129
00:08:10,681 --> 00:08:21,315
Rym: I believe you all know d-bolt the much-maligned Voting machine company even though while they're now known to pretty much everyone as the company that makes the broken voting machines That's actually a very small part of their business.

130
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:25,066
Scott: Yeah, d-bolt mostly makes like lock boxes and ATM.

131
00:08:25,226 --> 00:08:35,030
Scott: Yeah, they make physical security like safes and You know, they make metal boxes that people can't get into who aren't supposed to and they're okay at it.

132
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:40,610
Rym: Well, the thing is no one knew who they were until these voting machines started coming around and there were all the problems.

133
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:44,510
Scott: Like I you know, I saw their logo on a lot of boxes.

134
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:49,910
Rym: No, I never thought about them consciously But most people didn't know like know who they were what they did or didn't care.

135
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,562
Rym: It's like you see an elevator and you see Otis stamped in the bottom.

136
00:08:52,602 --> 00:08:54,390
Rym: No one actually knows anything about that.

137
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,676
Scott: Yeah, it's exactly the same.

138
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:58,270
Rym: and then they suddenly became into the in the news.

139
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:03,836
Rym: They were in the spotlight and it was nothing but bad press ever Constant bad press granted.

140
00:09:04,057 --> 00:09:17,103
Rym: It was entirely their fault for making shitty voting machines, but nonetheless since voting machines are actually a very small part of their business a very Barely profitable part and a very maligned part.

141
00:09:17,444 --> 00:09:24,789
Rym: They're considering just dropping it all together Discontinuing all their voting machines getting out of that business being done with it the end sounds good to me.

142
00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:30,230
Rym: Yeah, maybe now there'll be an opening for a company that's competent to make voting machines.

143
00:09:30,531 --> 00:09:43,850
Scott: Well, see here's the thing that I'm worried about right my favorite voting machine And I don't know what parts of the country have them but around I mean they have them in Beacon, New York And they have them in Trumbull Connecticut and I'm pretty sure they had them in Rochester, New York.

144
00:09:43,911 --> 00:09:47,419
Scott: So I'm pretty sure they're in Norton a Northeast US kind of machine.

145
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:56,036
Scott: and it's this machine you walk into You pull a lever and this curtain behind you closes you flick a bunch of switches that have little X's and you pull the Lever back the other way.

146
00:09:56,056 --> 00:10:00,937
Scott: I don't know the name of the machine, but I know That the machine is pretty reliable.

147
00:10:00,957 --> 00:10:03,786
Scott: It counts about as accurately as can be expected.

148
00:10:03,806 --> 00:10:16,930
Scott: It's Secure, you know and you can't vote twice or anything like that and they don't make them anymore and the company that made them is Gone, however in this case, I don't feel bad because d-bold people shouldn't be using those machines anyway.

149
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:17,632
Scott: No, they shouldn't.

150
00:10:17,673 --> 00:10:18,415
Scott: but here's the thing.

151
00:10:18,676 --> 00:10:22,550
Scott: We got two companies making voting machines going away.

152
00:10:23,172 --> 00:10:26,823
Scott: Maybe there's just no money in making voting machines at all.

153
00:10:26,863 --> 00:10:28,367
Rym: Yeah think think about it.

154
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:29,230
Rym: Who's your customer?

155
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,290
Rym: You've got one customer and that is well the government.

156
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,909
Scott: What if you can sell voting machines to all of the voting?

157
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:42,090
Scott: Countries and all of the other things that people vote for things that aren't necessarily federal elections or state elections?

158
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:48,390
Scott: You know people vote for like sports stuff like who's gonna go to the Hall of Fame and they don't use voting machines for that.

159
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,842
Rym: That's just crazy and stupid.

160
00:10:49,862 --> 00:10:50,468
Scott: Maybe they could

161
00:10:51,213 --> 00:10:51,877
Rym: How I

162
00:10:51,897 --> 00:10:56,770
Scott: don't know but if I was selling voting machines I would try to get them to so I can make some goddamn money

163
00:10:57,251 --> 00:11:02,969
Rym: Now because voting machines are very expensive to make and and well you'd assume there's a lot of accountability even though there actually isn't.

164
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:10,410
Rym: the problem is that your only real customer even if you did sell one-offs like that is local governments and the federal government and state governments.

165
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:14,242
Rym: Yep, and none of them want to spend money ever.

166
00:11:14,603 --> 00:11:15,064
Rym: so they're not.

167
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,108
Rym: they're going to bid low.

168
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,054
Rym: Their their pride is not.

169
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:23,877
Rym: even if you don't have a product that's so cheap that they can't afford to not buy it They'll just keep using the broken machine.

170
00:11:23,897 --> 00:11:24,580
Rym: They've already got.

171
00:11:25,082 --> 00:11:32,850
Scott: yeah, it just worries me that you know It would be nice to have good voting machines that were everywhere that were always the same and always worked.

172
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:39,270
Scott: Well and the company that made them actually still maintain them and made more of them in case something happened.

173
00:11:39,551 --> 00:11:47,590
Rym: Well, the thing is Devo was making money supposedly on voting machines Just not enough money for them to care especially considering the bad press they were getting.

174
00:11:47,851 --> 00:11:48,292
Scott: Yeah, so

175
00:11:48,934 --> 00:12:05,790
Rym: a company could make voting machines and be profitable, which would be great, but it couldn't be continually increasingly profitable which means no venture capitalists to go anywhere near it and Anyone who has the business sense to start a company like that has the understanding that they can make more money in any other industry.

176
00:12:05,971 --> 00:12:08,364
Rym: Yeah, so no one smart is going to make voting machine.

177
00:12:08,404 --> 00:12:10,758
Scott: Yeah, here's the other problem I just realized just now.

178
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:20,756
Scott: if you make good voting machines Those voting machines will last a long time and not break often and thus once you've sold them to everyone You got nothing left to do.

179
00:12:20,937 --> 00:12:24,250
Rym: That's why you always sell them with the service contract and you make them proprietary.

180
00:12:24,972 --> 00:12:27,200
Rym: Oh, but then you're doing part of what d-bolt did.

181
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:27,702
Scott: Yep.

182
00:12:27,883 --> 00:12:28,264
Rym: Huh?

183
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,950
Rym: You know, there's just no easy answer.

184
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:46,726
Rym: I mean the easy answer in a perfect world is that government should make voting machines and just pay for them for like have a standard voting machines need to meet X standard and then Have money and say that no matter what every government election will have these voting machines.

185
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,190
Rym: That way there is no chance of problem.

186
00:12:48,771 --> 00:12:56,030
Rym: However, there is no way I'd think in our current government that that could be done efficiently and without massive grafts.

187
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,418
Scott: It's not it's just not gonna happen.

188
00:12:57,438 --> 00:13:08,640
Rym: However much we wanted to even if it wasn't graft I just think it would be in some way there would be so much loss either by corruption or incompetence or just Inefficiency, so I found this great news.

189
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:15,583
Scott: That is not only I don't know bad But also relevant to the topics you have been discussing in recent weeks.

190
00:13:15,944 --> 00:13:16,927
Rym: What topics would those be?

191
00:13:16,947 --> 00:13:22,009
Scott: Well, I guess intranets and networking in some way, uh All right.

192
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:34,229
Scott: Well for those you don't know an intranet website is a website that you can only view when you're on the same Intranet like if you work for a company and you have your internal corporate website that you can only get to from work.

193
00:13:34,734 --> 00:13:36,090
Scott: Yep, that's what we're talking about.

194
00:13:36,571 --> 00:13:41,726
Scott: So Best Buy like most other companies of course has intranet websites.

195
00:13:41,806 --> 00:13:49,329
Scott: if you are at a Best Buy office or in a Best Buy store using a computer on the Best Buy internal network, you can visit this site.

196
00:13:49,349 --> 00:14:01,990
Scott: and the problem is Best Buy also has a real website and they have somehow decided who knows why that the URL for the Best Buy website is Best Buy calm.

197
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:11,356
Scott: However, if you are on the Best Buy network the URL for the internal Best Buy website is also Best Buy calm.

198
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:21,890
Scott: All right, that shouldn't be a problem except Best Buy Advertises prices on their real website and a lot of people go to the Best Buy calm at home.

199
00:14:22,273 --> 00:14:24,009
Scott: They see prices for products.

200
00:14:24,471 --> 00:14:29,910
Scott: They then go to the actual Best Buy store and they say I saw this price on the website.

201
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:32,179
Scott: How come this is not the price in the store.

202
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:40,228
Scott: the person in the Best Buy store takes a computer which is on the Best Buy Network you see where we're going with this and goes to Best Buy.

203
00:14:40,288 --> 00:14:51,970
Scott: calm and The price there is not the same one that the person saw on their computer at home and thus their choice is to either buy The product at the higher price or go home empty-handed.

204
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,098
Scott: Thievery, it's basically thievery now.

205
00:14:55,539 --> 00:14:56,522
Scott: Is it intentional?

206
00:14:57,205 --> 00:14:57,987
Scott: It's a tough call.

207
00:14:58,007 --> 00:14:59,736
Scott: whether it's intentional I'm gonna go with.

208
00:14:59,796 --> 00:15:01,346
Rym: yes, that's my opinion.

209
00:15:01,386 --> 00:15:06,424
Scott: my hunch My guess is I'm saying 60% likely that it is intentional.

210
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:09,357
Scott: However, I do not think it is like Intentional as in.

211
00:15:09,478 --> 00:15:11,289
Scott: everyone knows that this is going on.

212
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:19,958
Scott: The employees aren't smart enough to realize that they're going to the secret intranet website, you know to Trick the customers or anything.

213
00:15:19,979 --> 00:15:21,806
Rym: Well, if they were they wouldn't be working at Best Buy.

214
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,114
Scott: That's for sure You know.

215
00:15:24,134 --> 00:15:35,349
Scott: and and if it is intentional, it's probably just a few people at Best Buy saying hey we can totally do this and make the internal website Best Buy calm.

216
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:41,987
Scott: and You know whenever this low prices on the real website We'll just put low ones on the internet site and go ha ha ha.

217
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:46,690
Rym: See I'd have to see a rundown of which prices were different and buy in what direction they were different.

218
00:15:47,192 --> 00:15:58,890
Rym: But I can't I mean unless the only way I could see this happening if say the internal one in the external one Generate static pages and pull from their price database at different intervals in which case this could happen legitimately.

219
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:03,386
Rym: However, most likely they just dynamically generate the content.

220
00:16:03,868 --> 00:16:05,816
Rym: I mean, I don't know I haven't really looked at Best Buy's website.

221
00:16:05,836 --> 00:16:09,349
Rym: If that's the case, I can't see any way this could happen except malfeasance.

222
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:16,688
Scott: The other thing is maybe the internal website, you know There's people who work for Best Buy that manage the content on the websites and stuff like that.

223
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:26,648
Scott: Maybe they purposefully make the internal website different from the external one because the internal one is being visited by Best Buy Employees and whatever and as different customers.

224
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:32,870
Rym: Oh, yeah But the price database the database information holding prices and products should be the same between both.

225
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:36,750
Rym: There's no reason for it not to be unless you expect to rip people off with it.

226
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:42,148
Scott: Well, usually it's like special sales and maybe they have special internal sales and special external sales.

227
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:42,810
Scott: Who knows what they do?

228
00:16:42,991 --> 00:16:43,714
Scott: I have no idea.

229
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,750
Scott: But yeah, it's a pretty good chance that there's something sketchy.

230
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:51,546
Rym: If they were doing that, why would they make it look exactly like the outside website?

231
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:52,650
Rym: I don't know.

232
00:16:53,152 --> 00:16:56,209
Rym: I just I see no legitimate cause for this.

233
00:16:56,892 --> 00:17:03,775
Scott: Oh, I like I said, I think there's a 60% chance is intentional by someone at Best Buy and 40% chance.

234
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:04,478
Scott: They're just stupid.

235
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,307
Rym: I'm going with an 80% chance of malfeasance All right.

236
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:18,657
Scott: Anyway, the Best Buy basically said that they're going to train their employees on how to get to the real Best Buy .com instead of the intranet Best Buy.com.

237
00:17:18,678 --> 00:17:20,262
Scott: Wow, this doesn't happen.

238
00:17:20,703 --> 00:17:23,210
Rym: That seems like not the right solution.

239
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:31,370
Scott: Yeah Why don't they just make the same what but make the intranet website a different URL so no one would visit it by accident?

240
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:42,540
Rym: Yeah in fact It seems like the training would just make managers aware of the fact that if they don't want to honor a sale all they Have to do is go to the Best Buy.com internal, huh Gee, I don't know.

241
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,830
Rym: I don't Best Buy.

242
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:44,713
Rym: I mean, they're not.

243
00:17:45,014 --> 00:17:52,524
Rym: I'm not gonna claim that Best Buy is some evil company because they're not really any worse than most other companies But I just generally dislike many of the practices of Best Buy.

244
00:17:52,544 --> 00:17:53,890
Scott: Yeah, Best Buy is pretty sketchy.

245
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:58,108
Rym: I mean mostly the fact that their employees well, probably not their fault.

246
00:17:58,128 --> 00:17:58,670
Rym: They're probably forced.

247
00:17:58,771 --> 00:17:59,968
Rym: Well, I know they're forced to do it.

248
00:18:00,572 --> 00:18:04,310
Rym: They really push those bullshit monster cables on you when you can buy.

249
00:18:04,631 --> 00:18:08,350
Scott: The employees at Best Buy are normal people, you know.

250
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,383
Scott: They believe that shit just as much as the people they're selling it to.

251
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,909
Scott: they're not experts on what they're selling It's it's just all.

252
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:21,190
Scott: Someone who actually understood that technology would have to be you know, a scammer at heart to actually sell it.

253
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,008
Rym: Yeah, but the company itself understands and they are scamming.

254
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:35,700
Scott: I think that there are people at monster cables who believe that monster cables are bad things of the day.

255
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:45,855
Scott: Okay, my thing today is something very old that I finally found again after trying a lot Basically Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

256
00:18:46,338 --> 00:18:54,160
Scott: No So, um, uh at my work my co-worker is an Emacs user.

257
00:18:56,063 --> 00:19:00,420
Rym: If you don't know what that is, don't worry, yes, I'm a VI man.

258
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:03,108
Rym: So I'm also a VI man, though.

259
00:19:03,128 --> 00:19:05,840
Rym: I'm also ashamedly a nano pico man.

260
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:10,776
Scott: Yeah, I used to be a nano pico man, but then I sort of don't use those any.

261
00:19:10,856 --> 00:19:11,820
Rym: it depends on what I'm doing.

262
00:19:12,161 --> 00:19:16,179
Scott: Yeah, hey VI pretty much does it for me no matter what's going on at these days.

263
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:23,660
Scott: Anyway, so, you know, we had a little funny, you know, we're not like vicious girl you're stupid-ass using Emacs or anything.

264
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:26,219
Scott: But you know, we're like he he he Emacs VI he.

265
00:19:27,122 --> 00:19:33,840
Scott: So I finally found the old comic that it's a one panel comic that is drawn poorly.

266
00:19:34,362 --> 00:19:39,200
Scott: But if you know about Emacs and VI it is hilarious and classic.

267
00:19:39,381 --> 00:19:42,031
Rym: Yeah, you found that one when we were like sophomores at RIT.

268
00:19:42,051 --> 00:19:48,030
Scott: Yeah, it was probably drawn in like 1978 or some shit like that.

269
00:19:48,311 --> 00:19:50,620
Scott: I don't know when they made Emacs, but VI is pretty old.

270
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,606
Scott: But yeah, it's a good comic.

271
00:19:52,866 --> 00:20:04,589
Scott: if you know about VI and Emacs and you can just replace VI and Emacs with whatever you could replace it with like Wii and PS3 or Anything like that and it'll be still be funny.

272
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:07,320
Rym: So I had a thing of the day.

273
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,399
Rym: It was gonna be a throwaway.

274
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:16,100
Rym: So I'll just get it out of the way what it is and then I'll take you down this magical journey that led me to a world I could never imagine.

275
00:20:16,662 --> 00:20:19,070
Rym: You see Digg often has pseudoscience.

276
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,940
Scott: Sadly this real world that you could never imagine is the real world.

277
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:29,188
Rym: Digg has a lot of pseudoscience bullshit that gets dug up and then gets buried by the berry brigade Which I of which I am a proud member.

278
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,840
Rym: and over the weekend, you know, Emily and Alex were over.

279
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:41,512
Rym: I don't know why I said Adam Adam definitely was not over and we're watching videos on Digg and there's this video last night about The conspiracy of science.

280
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:45,949
Scott: the expanding earth Scientists are keeping a secret from you.

281
00:20:45,969 --> 00:20:57,845
Scott: They know the real history of the earth and They're telling you some other history of the earth They want you to believe but they know the truth and they're keeping it from you for evil reasons which there aren't any of.

282
00:20:57,905 --> 00:21:03,703
Rym: so Scott had buried this without even looking at it because it's obvious what it is some crazy conspiracy not Whatever no big deal.

283
00:21:04,406 --> 00:21:06,533
Rym: I decided hey, let's watch this.

284
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:17,906
Rym: and I watched the video and It's this animation that some nut job made of the earth and he makes the earth shrink and all the while He's talking in this crazy kind of.

285
00:21:18,247 --> 00:21:21,256
Rym: you know that voice that those conspiracy nuts always have.

286
00:21:21,717 --> 00:21:25,187
Scott: there is a kind of Conspiracy of silence among certain scientists.

287
00:21:25,448 --> 00:21:35,680
Scott: they know but are not telling you that the upper tectonic plates of earth Also join in the Pacific not partially they join totally.

288
00:21:36,102 --> 00:21:43,052
Scott: You are asked to believe that the continents swim or drift about willy-nilly Bumping and crashing as if they were on a grease skillet.

289
00:21:43,895 --> 00:21:45,100
Rym: This is not true.

290
00:21:46,262 --> 00:21:50,040
Scott: The simple truth is apparently too upsetting to too many apple carts.

291
00:21:51,824 --> 00:21:55,364
Rym: So he basically through this video Proports the theory.

292
00:21:55,665 --> 00:22:08,467
Rym: Well, I guess the supposition the claim it's barely even a hypothesis if that that the earth Doesn't have these moving plates or Pangea or you know any of that stuff that we have, you know dreams and dreams dreams evidence for.

293
00:22:08,507 --> 00:22:21,473
Rym: but no the earth used to be in fact a lot smaller and That's why all the planet all the continents used to be touching each other not because you know They shifted around but because the earth used to be tiny and it's been growing ever since.

294
00:22:22,395 --> 00:22:29,199
Scott: and I don't know I didn't watch it long enough to find out his explanation as to where the water came from.

295
00:22:29,986 --> 00:22:32,838
Scott: but Where did the water come from?

296
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:40,719
Rym: I mean the video just shows the oceans kind of shrinking and everything shrinking and all the this bad Animation of all the plates and all the continents kind of coming together.

297
00:22:41,121 --> 00:22:42,966
Rym: Meanwhile, he's talking his crazy nut job.

298
00:22:43,026 --> 00:22:44,851
Rym: And this is one of those typical.

299
00:22:45,353 --> 00:22:46,797
Rym: It's reminiscent of time cube.

300
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,706
Scott: Ah Yes, the time cube.

301
00:22:50,047 --> 00:22:51,231
Scott: It's pretty much the same shit.

302
00:22:51,271 --> 00:22:54,100
Scott: some guy makes up some science, you know.

303
00:22:54,140 --> 00:23:00,040
Scott: He just finds something that makes a lot of sense to him doesn't follow the scientific method, you know.

304
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:16,080
Scott: He just says hey, I thought of an idea and that idea makes a whole lot of sense to me You know because of coincidences even though I have no actual evidence for it And there's a lot of contradictory evidence that says it's wrong But I'm gonna continue believing it anyway.

305
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:20,452
Scott: And because these scientists don't agree they must all be keeping it a secret.

306
00:23:20,814 --> 00:23:23,060
Scott: or they're crazy or evil or something.

307
00:23:23,181 --> 00:23:24,231
Rym: Now what I love is this guy.

308
00:23:24,372 --> 00:23:36,379
Rym: actually there's this big Conspiracy to hide the truth that it would knock over too many apple carts if people knew the real History of the earth but yet his idea even if it were true wouldn't really change much.

309
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,726
Scott: What apple carts is you're knocking over?

310
00:23:38,786 --> 00:23:43,359
Rym: what industry I ask you our faithful listeners what industry what?

311
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:50,820
Rym: Industrial complex has a vested interest in hiding the fact that the earth used to be tiny and is growing.

312
00:23:51,825 --> 00:23:52,078
Scott: Nobody.

313
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,800
Rym: And where did the water come from now?

314
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:56,587
Rym: That was my thing at the day.

315
00:23:56,608 --> 00:24:00,690
Scott: in fact if the earth were growing they'll be fantastic Because we wouldn't run out of room now.

316
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,000
Rym: We'd have issues with gravity and bumping into things.

317
00:24:04,102 --> 00:24:07,419
Scott: We in which case it well well, but what can we do about it?

318
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,337
Rym: Well, we could just keep digging holes and making the earth smaller and shooting it out into space.

319
00:24:11,699 --> 00:24:11,980
Scott: I guess

320
00:24:14,225 --> 00:24:37,428
Rym: When I was a kid actually when I was a little kid And I was learning about space cuz you know every kid wanted to be an astronaut dinosaur Mm-hmm, so I Realized that whenever they went up into space they brought air with them and pee and all that stuff with them And they left stuff out there, and I thought wait a minute astronauts are gonna destroy the earth because they keep taking our air and letting it out in space and Eventually they're gonna take all the air up there.

321
00:24:37,448 --> 00:24:38,754
Rym: How are we gonna get it back?

322
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:40,060
Rym: and as a kid?

323
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,978
Rym: This was a dire problem as far as I could tell.

324
00:24:45,462 --> 00:24:57,380
Rym: But anyway I Would have been done right then after making my little joke telling me You know my childhood fears, and then we would have gone on to talk about network address translation.

325
00:24:57,521 --> 00:24:58,747
Rym: But I couldn't.

326
00:24:58,868 --> 00:25:01,079
Rym: I mean Scott buried this and I didn't want to dig it.

327
00:25:01,461 --> 00:25:10,319
Rym: So I had to search through the buried articles on dig to find it to link to it for my thing at the day And I was doing that before the show being proactive And I watched it again for funny and to get the audio out of it.

328
00:25:10,721 --> 00:25:23,920
Rym: And I noticed that in the related articles now the related videos There were like 10 more videos by the same guy with all sorts of crazy conspiracy theories all involving plate tectonics.

329
00:25:24,381 --> 00:25:27,430
Scott: Surprisingly enough alright, so the guy's name was what.

330
00:25:27,852 --> 00:25:30,560
Rym: so Neil Adams has made all these videos, and they're all crazy.

331
00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:32,360
Rym: So I just googled Wikipedia.

332
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:37,244
Rym: You know see look up Neil Adams see if someone wrote an article about this nut job So they'll have something to say on the show.

333
00:25:37,685 --> 00:25:44,603
Rym: and the first link is to Neil Adams the semi famous Marvel Drawing dude.

334
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:50,040
Scott: he drew comics for Marvel, and I've never read a Neil Adams comic, but I said yeah, that's right.

335
00:25:50,321 --> 00:25:54,320
Scott: I have heard people talk about a guy who makes comics called Neil Adams.

336
00:25:54,561 --> 00:25:55,365
Rym: So I think all right.

337
00:25:55,486 --> 00:25:58,020
Rym: obviously this guy just shares a name with a nut job.

338
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:07,539
Rym: So I keep searching and when he keeps searching I said wait It might be the same dude, and I think you know what the odds of that are pretty low, so I look around I don't see much else on the internet.

339
00:26:08,182 --> 00:26:13,300
Rym: And then I find Neil Adams comm and I see comic stuff and 3d animation stuff.

340
00:26:13,661 --> 00:26:17,251
Rym: And I also see crazy conspiracies theory stuff at the bottom.

341
00:26:17,271 --> 00:26:28,206
Rym: so I go back to the Wikipedia and down under trivia It says Adams has a very has very publicly promoted a theory Credited to Samuel Warren Carvey.

342
00:26:28,547 --> 00:26:34,080
Rym: carry that the earth is hollow and along with every other celestial body is growing.

343
00:26:34,602 --> 00:26:44,260
Rym: He has spoken at length on this through articles animations on his official site www.neiladams.com and participated in an article about the subject in Wired magazine.

344
00:26:44,923 --> 00:26:50,379
Scott: Well, I can tell you this I have never read a Neil Adams comic to my knowledge So I cannot comment on their quality.

345
00:26:50,921 --> 00:26:53,990
Scott: But the earth is most certainly not hollow.

346
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:57,400
Scott: if you dig you will be burned by lava.

347
00:26:58,002 --> 00:26:59,849
Rym: Well you might find gold or oil or pirates.

348
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:08,420
Scott: also if the earth was hollow It wouldn't have enough gravity to hold us here, and we would fly off into space.

349
00:27:09,202 --> 00:27:19,120
Rym: Now just the fact that I found this nutjob and it turns out that he's a semi-famous comic artist Who's also a nutjob and he's very open about this?

350
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,720
Rym: He's made all these videos on the internet, so he's at least somewhat technically confident.

351
00:27:23,322 --> 00:27:24,887
Rym: How can someone like this be?

352
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:28,640
Rym: how can you be smart enough to draw comics and make computer?

353
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,837
Rym: Animations and yet not smart enough to realize that the idea that the earth is hollow is ludicrous.

354
00:27:34,358 --> 00:27:39,049
Scott: ludicrous Because you I don't know this guy's like.

355
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:42,261
Rym: I'm gonna say it straight up Neil Adams for whatever I mean.

356
00:27:42,301 --> 00:27:43,587
Rym: he won some awards.

357
00:27:43,627 --> 00:27:46,840
Rym: he won the Shazam Awards and the alley Awards and all this stuff.

358
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,727
Rym: But he's a crazy nutjob.

359
00:27:48,807 --> 00:27:49,650
Scott: He's a kook.

360
00:27:49,871 --> 00:27:50,653
Rym: He's an idiot.

361
00:27:50,694 --> 00:27:51,436
Rym: He's a crank.

362
00:27:51,496 --> 00:27:52,480
Rym: He's a crackpot.

363
00:27:52,862 --> 00:27:55,454
Rym: He's a kook and I find this hilarious.

364
00:27:55,835 --> 00:27:56,800
Scott: It is quite hilarious.

365
00:27:57,202 --> 00:28:00,656
Rym: So anyway, we're going to talk about network address translation.

366
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:04,213
Rym: now again We're gonna talk about this in layman's terms like we've been doing lately.

367
00:28:04,635 --> 00:28:18,020
Rym: if you're not familiar with Networking or ports or IP addresses or any of that stuff check out the previous two Monday night episodes where we have talked about IP addresses and ports and all that stuff in layman easy to understand terms

368
00:28:18,722 --> 00:28:24,280
Scott: Alright, so before I want to talk about what network translation is I want to talk about the problem it solves.

369
00:28:24,941 --> 00:28:28,871
Scott: Do you remember and when we were talking about IP addresses how you know?

370
00:28:29,071 --> 00:28:35,224
Scott: IP addresses are between zero dot zero dot zero dot zero and 255 dot 255 to 255.

371
00:28:35,224 --> 00:28:38,480
Scott: So how many total possible IP addresses are there?

372
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:42,590
Scott: Let's 255 times 255 times 255 times 255 possible.

373
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:45,880
Rym: I think the point is that there is a finite number.

374
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:58,555
Rym: Yes There are not that many possible IP addresses and also that alone if that's not bad enough a lot of the address is in there Can't be used because they're reserved or they're special or they're part of something else.

375
00:28:58,615 --> 00:28:59,900
Rym: So it makes the pool even smaller.

376
00:29:00,061 --> 00:29:15,360
Scott: yes, so there are not enough IP addresses and people are thinking about making technologies in the future where your toaster will have an IP address and your refrigerator will have an IP address and if we do That there aren't going to be enough of them for every device that needs one.

377
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:27,147
Scott: so one solution to this problem is to replace the whole IP system with a Different IP system a more different IP Called IP v6.

378
00:29:27,548 --> 00:29:35,571
Rym: now IP v6 is interesting because it would give more IP addresses per square meter of the earth's surface than we could probably ever use.

379
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:42,800
Rym: it is in many ways or at least looked at by many experts To be the end-all of many of the problems that IP faces currently.

380
00:29:43,163 --> 00:29:46,827
Rym: However, it is one It didn't really exist back in the day.

381
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:51,160
Rym: and two it is not being adopted in any reasonable rate.

382
00:29:51,603 --> 00:29:53,656
Rym: Well, yeah, but it also has problems.

383
00:29:53,757 --> 00:29:59,020
Scott: not yes The thing is IP v6 would be great, but we're not implementing it in any real world.

384
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:07,283
Scott: You know super situations across the planet because it would basically mean we have to take everything apart and put everything back together again which no one wants to do.

385
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:16,220
Scott: and also we don't really need to go to IP v6 because while We have more devices on the internets than we have IP addresses.

386
00:30:16,722 --> 00:30:18,491
Scott: We have a solution to this problem.

387
00:30:18,913 --> 00:30:20,118
Scott: the solution is net.

388
00:30:21,122 --> 00:30:28,260
Rym: You see back when the IP crunches people call it was starting to really get into full swing and there was a lot of talk About are we gonna run out of IP addresses?

389
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,395
Rym: the US has all the IP addresses and it's hard for anyone else to get on the internet.

390
00:30:32,435 --> 00:30:37,780
Rym: and there was a big deal and People realize that you could actually deal with this problem in an interesting way.

391
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:46,967
Rym: Let's say you made a box a special box where you plug in your network on one end of it and you plug in the outside World on the other end of it.

392
00:30:47,187 --> 00:30:50,360
Rym: So it's a little box between your network and the internet as a whole.

393
00:30:51,262 --> 00:30:55,996
Rym: Now, let's say I have a hundred or a thousand computers, but I only have.

394
00:30:56,738 --> 00:31:00,511
Rym: I have a hundred computers But I only have one IP address without that box.

395
00:31:00,973 --> 00:31:02,178
Rym: I can only have one of my computers.

396
00:31:02,198 --> 00:31:02,740
Rym: go online.

397
00:31:03,082 --> 00:31:04,087
Rym: It's got an IP address.

398
00:31:04,469 --> 00:31:06,600
Rym: all my other computers can't do anything online.

399
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,174
Rym: They can't have an IP address because there aren't any.

400
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:10,140
Scott: that sucks.

401
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,739
Scott: What are you gonna do about that?

402
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:21,840
Rym: well I could run net and what net would do is allow any one of my computers to borrow and use that one external IP Address whenever I needed to get outside.

403
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:27,700
Rym: So my IP address is ten dot ten dot ten dot ten and I have all my computers inside.

404
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:32,660
Rym: So computer number one can borrow ten dot ten dot ten dot ten whenever he needs to go outside.

405
00:31:32,983 --> 00:31:40,480
Rym: So as far as the outside world is concerned He is ten dot ten dot ten dot ten and when he's done then some other computer on the network can get outside.

406
00:31:40,807 --> 00:31:41,420
Scott: Wait a second.

407
00:31:41,522 --> 00:31:50,720
Scott: But if you do that What if I have five people who all want to read dig at the same time or five people want a bit torrent all at The same time or five people want to play counter-strike all at the same time.

408
00:31:51,001 --> 00:31:53,839
Scott: They can't all have ten dot ten dot ten dot ten at the same time.

409
00:31:54,161 --> 00:32:00,620
Rym: Well, that's fine because when this technology was used early on there weren't that many uses for the internet for most people.

410
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:05,643
Rym: I mean you'd have a business and you have your corporate intranet and you'd have all your computers In that network.

411
00:32:06,085 --> 00:32:10,722
Rym: very few of your computers needed to get to the outside world ever so.

412
00:32:10,742 --> 00:32:19,548
Rym: you had an internal private network and you'd use the net for the critical machines that had to get outside or for whatever Communications or a lot of times.

413
00:32:19,588 --> 00:32:27,339
Rym: if you had two different networks that happen to have the same IP address Scheme you could translate between the two and connect these two internal networks without problems.

414
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,326
Rym: Obviously, this is not the solution.

415
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:37,172
Rym: for you know, having a whole bunch of computers share a single IP address Yeah, I got this company with 10,000 people.

416
00:32:37,212 --> 00:32:38,337
Scott: We got one IP address.

417
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:40,805
Scott: Whoo It's gonna be fun.

418
00:32:41,367 --> 00:32:50,638
Rym: So along those lines we have port address translation, which very simply Allows a whole bunch of computers to share one or more IP addresses and get outside.

419
00:32:50,658 --> 00:32:53,032
Rym: yet You don't need more IP addresses.

420
00:32:53,052 --> 00:32:54,180
Rym: They can do it all simultaneously.

421
00:32:54,642 --> 00:32:58,856
Rym: So all ten of my computers can get outside using that one IP address.

422
00:32:58,916 --> 00:33:00,120
Rym: ten dot ten dot ten dot ten.

423
00:33:00,762 --> 00:33:05,040
Rym: Using the magic of mathematics and the Internet, what are those magics?

424
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,329
Scott: Let us demystify the magic tricks now.

425
00:33:08,771 --> 00:33:11,480
Rym: You actually are very likely using that right now.

426
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:20,900
Rym: Well, you know technically you're using pat port address translation, but colloquially on the internet It is all referred to as Nat so I'm gonna call it Nat for simplicity.

427
00:33:21,161 --> 00:33:33,579
Scott: Yep, if you have a link sis or a netgear router of some sort, you know Like you plug your cable modem which has the I real IP address Into say your router or whatever and then you plug a bunch of computers on the other side of it.

428
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,068
Scott: Guess what that router is doing the net.

429
00:33:36,489 --> 00:33:39,560
Rym: Well, the cable modem usually doesn't actually have the IP address.

430
00:33:39,641 --> 00:33:40,879
Rym: It's usually just a dumb device.

431
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:45,802
Rym: Well, yeah, but you know because if you have one computer you plug it into the cable modem and your computer gets that one IP address.

432
00:33:45,822 --> 00:33:46,022
Scott: Yeah.

433
00:33:46,042 --> 00:33:46,223
Scott: Yeah.

434
00:33:46,243 --> 00:33:48,892
Scott: Yeah, but your router gets the IP address from the yeah

435
00:33:49,835 --> 00:34:00,520
Rym: as opposed to yeah any yeah Yeah, so back in the old days if you had more than one computer in your house you had to buy multiple IP addresses one For each computer you had and it totally sucked.

436
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,800
Rym: They were like five bucks a month on top of what you were paying.

437
00:34:03,422 --> 00:34:10,849
Rym: so then these links as routers started coming out and what you could do is buy a router and A lot of people consider this cheating the cable company.

438
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:18,800
Rym: and back in the day a lot of cable modems and a lot of service Providers actually had rules prohibiting you from using net because they want you to buy IP addresses from them.

439
00:34:19,201 --> 00:34:26,312
Scott: Yeah, I didn't have actually realized until just now like how far Networking like home networking technology has come.

440
00:34:26,492 --> 00:34:30,206
Rym: Yeah when I get a day when I had a cable modem You couldn't buy switches.

441
00:34:30,507 --> 00:34:32,696
Rym: you just there weren't consumer switches and you were.

442
00:34:32,716 --> 00:34:33,800
Rym: there were consumer routers.

443
00:34:34,101 --> 00:34:37,492
Rym: You could buy 10 base hubs that were half duplex and cost 80 bucks.

444
00:34:38,074 --> 00:34:40,181
Scott: Yeah nowadays a hub is like $2.

445
00:34:40,181 --> 00:34:42,760
Scott: No one even uses hubs really anymore barely anyway.

446
00:34:43,141 --> 00:34:46,280
Scott: It's like you can get a switch and you can get a router and they're all stupidly cheap.

447
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:48,306
Scott: You get a router cheaper now.

448
00:34:48,706 --> 00:34:52,920
Scott: that's faster than computers were when we were trying to use hubs.

449
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,170
Rym: So most likely you're using a router that has net.

450
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:00,626
Rym: that's the way you can have your multiple lock computers connect to the internet But you only have one external IP.

451
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:11,699
Rym: now the way this works and this is kind of important because a lot of people wonder about Port forwarding or why their bit torrent is always slow and all those things and this hopefully illuminate some of that.

452
00:35:12,742 --> 00:35:17,860
Rym: You see you've got one IP address on the outside and we talked about ports last time so you know how ports work.

453
00:35:18,562 --> 00:35:29,930
Rym: Say I want to connect to a server out there on a telnet to a server somewhere from my computer behind a net so I tell that to the server and My computer has an internal IP address.

454
00:35:30,272 --> 00:35:35,357
Rym: Usually your router will have a DHCP So you'll get a 10 dot whatever IP address.

455
00:35:35,377 --> 00:35:42,017
Rym: your computers 10 dot 10 dot 10 dot 10 and you connect to the outside IP address that the server you're connecting to.

456
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:50,791
Rym: that has a real IP address like 129 dot 21 dot 21 dot 1. so you connect to it and Your computer goes through the net.

457
00:35:50,991 --> 00:35:52,317
Rym: so you connect to the computer.

458
00:35:52,338 --> 00:36:03,060
Rym: on the outside The net is transparent but along the way the net takes your IP address 10 dot 10 dot 10 dot 10 Replaces it with its own and sends the message forwards.

459
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:10,280
Rym: It's on all the packets to the computer you're connecting to as though it were you and as though you had that IP address.

460
00:36:10,862 --> 00:36:22,997
Scott: So instead of you talking to a computer on the internet you talk to your router and your router which has a real IP address Talks to the computer out on the internet for you And then whatever that computer says back your router gives back to you.

461
00:36:23,499 --> 00:36:25,888
Rym: now How could this work if you have more than one computer connecting?

462
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:31,310
Rym: because now I connect out and the thing tries to talk to Me it talks back to my net router.

463
00:36:31,591 --> 00:36:33,339
Rym: the router then forwards those packets to me.

464
00:36:33,822 --> 00:36:37,380
Rym: How would the router know to forward stuff to me or to my other computer?

465
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:41,960
Rym: How would the other computer out on the outside world know who it was talking to?

466
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,314
Rym: What if two people behind a net were both connecting to the same server?

467
00:36:45,635 --> 00:36:46,499
Rym: How would it deal with that?

468
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,599
Rym: So it does all this with ports.

469
00:36:49,183 --> 00:36:51,655
Rym: So I connect through the net to the outside the net.

470
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:56,500
Rym: the outside computer Thinks that I'm coming from my external IP address the net IP address.

471
00:36:56,942 --> 00:37:14,969
Rym: But when my computer number one connects through the net it'll talk to Port 23 on the outside external computer from a random high port number say 12,001. and then when computer number two from my inside connects It'll connect to the net will make it.

472
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:24,920
Rym: so it looks like it's connecting to the outside computer from the same IP address But from port 12,002 and it remembers which port Corresponds to which computer on the inside.

473
00:37:25,341 --> 00:37:35,860
Rym: So when the server talks back to 12,001 it knows to send those packets to the first computer and when it talks back to 12,002 the net knows to send those packets to the second computer.

474
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,141
Rym: Yep,

475
00:37:36,382 --> 00:37:52,080
Scott: so as far as the computer out on the internet is concerned it thinks that it's having two Conversations with your router which has a real IP address, you know It thinks it's doing telnet with your router on this port and also telnet with your router on another port.

476
00:37:52,462 --> 00:38:11,615
Scott: It's telnetting with your router two times on two ports But your router knows that the telnet on that port is for computer A and the telnet on the other port is for computer B. so two conversations with one router to the outside world is really two Conversations with two computers hiding behind the router.

477
00:38:12,278 --> 00:38:12,700
Scott: It's magic.

478
00:38:13,402 --> 00:38:16,634
Rym: So now it does this for every single connection that you make.

479
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:20,300
Rym: so if you open your web browser Then it makes another one for all your web connections.

480
00:38:20,622 --> 00:38:28,195
Rym: If you know whatever you're doing every application you try to run and connect to the outside It opens up another port for that and it maps that port to your computer.

481
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:29,359
Rym: So you think all right.

482
00:38:29,681 --> 00:38:40,880
Rym: Theoretically, I mean if you'll remember to the last episode you have 65,000 535 ports, so Theoretically you could have that many connections shared among one IP address.

483
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:46,640
Rym: The number is actually much much smaller than that just due to the fact that your Linksys router is not actually very powerful.

484
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:55,960
Scott: It can probably only handle a couple thousand at most Yep, so what happens if we had a thousand computers, and we had everyone opened up a web browser and an instant messenger.

485
00:38:56,321 --> 00:39:01,278
Scott: That's like 2,000 or right there at least and the router can't really handle that.

486
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,527
Scott: now Let's say for even forget.

487
00:39:03,547 --> 00:39:05,777
Scott: Let's say the router had a supercomputer in it right.

488
00:39:05,797 --> 00:39:06,600
Scott: It was a super router.

489
00:39:07,022 --> 00:39:10,716
Scott: What if we had 70,000 computers, and they all open the web browser?

490
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:11,619
Scott: What do you do?

491
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:19,024
Rym: Well it just fails and almost no consumer level equipment gives you the power or the capacity to Deal with that problem.

492
00:39:19,546 --> 00:39:20,912
Rym: Oh, it's not something you have to worry about.

493
00:39:21,032 --> 00:39:21,614
Rym: that sucks.

494
00:39:21,956 --> 00:39:24,103
Rym: Yeah, luckily there's.

495
00:39:24,264 --> 00:39:31,465
Rym: I can't think of anyone even us who would ever have a home network that would outstrip a Consumer level Linksys net.

496
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:40,069
Scott: I guess if you had some spywares that kept opening up ports to spam servers all over the world then it Might probably wouldn't happen now.

497
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,897
Scott: No just wouldn't happen now.

498
00:39:41,917 --> 00:39:42,660
Rym: That's pretty much it.

499
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,997
Rym: That's how net works on a basic basic level.

500
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:49,354
Rym: now There are a lot of ramifications of this number one we can touch on briefly.

501
00:39:49,695 --> 00:39:51,783
Rym: think about it every time I go out.

502
00:39:52,244 --> 00:39:53,849
Rym: it maps whatever port you know.

503
00:39:53,889 --> 00:39:59,140
Rym: it maps the ports to figure out that any traffic coming back from whatever I went out on will go to my computer.

504
00:40:00,282 --> 00:40:03,079
Rym: What if something from the outside wants to connect to me?

505
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,080
Rym: What if I've got a FTP server on my internal network?

506
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,196
Rym: And I want someone on the outside to be able to connect to me.

507
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:16,620
Rym: well They try to connect to the router on port the FTP port and the router says I'm not running an FTP server.

508
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,524
Rym: Go fuck yourself.

509
00:40:17,925 --> 00:40:21,480
Scott: Yep, because remember the real IP address is your router.

510
00:40:21,701 --> 00:40:29,187
Scott: That's the real IP address on the internet, so if someone tries to connect to that from the outside to your router They're connecting to a router.

511
00:40:29,608 --> 00:40:31,135
Scott: that router doesn't know shit.

512
00:40:31,376 --> 00:40:32,099
Scott: It's not a compute.

513
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:37,760
Scott: well I guess it is technically a computer But it doesn't have any Services running on any ports waiting for connections.

514
00:40:38,243 --> 00:40:41,060
Scott: So if you try to connect to that router from the outside world it goes.

515
00:40:41,461 --> 00:40:44,571
Scott: I don't know what the hell you want, and this is a good thing.

516
00:40:44,872 --> 00:40:47,660
Scott: Yeah as it gets you a lot of security.

517
00:40:48,242 --> 00:40:55,843
Rym: yeah, if you are a little more technically adept you can install a program like ethereal or whatever they call it now and Sniff wireshark.

518
00:40:56,164 --> 00:41:01,220
Rym: yeah, and try to look at the stuff that's going on from your cable modem or from your DSL.

519
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:18,100
Rym: Yeah, just plug your computer directly into your cable modem, and then run ethereal or wireshark or you'll see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of worms attacks spams Garbage gibberish just can't this constant sea of never-ending bullshit?

520
00:41:18,675 --> 00:41:23,960
Scott: Yep So imagine if your computer instead of your router had the real IP address itself.

521
00:41:24,702 --> 00:41:34,840
Scott: All of that stuff would be hitting against your computer and your computer would have to have some sort of firewall or other Security measures installed so that it would have to say no no no go away.

522
00:41:34,987 --> 00:41:35,156
Scott: No.

523
00:41:35,481 --> 00:41:42,103
Rym: I mean you know all those windows worms that came about especially in the 90s where worm would go around connecting to like windows shares And messing things up.

524
00:41:42,605 --> 00:41:49,500
Scott: all those things would do is they would say if you see a computer try to connect to it on this Port and then give it this information.

525
00:41:50,004 --> 00:41:51,879
Rym: So they'll try to connect to your computer on that port.

526
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:55,957
Rym: But your computer is actually the router and the routers not listening on that port.

527
00:41:55,997 --> 00:41:58,528
Rym: so it doesn't care What comes in on that part doesn't even look at it.

528
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:00,940
Scott: so nothing will come into your network?

529
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:08,589
Scott: Unsolicited and all your computers behind the NAT router will be safe Unless you do something stupid like you know.

530
00:42:08,649 --> 00:42:11,098
Scott: download an outlook attachment or something like that.

531
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:25,177
Scott: Yes, as far as worms that are trying to attack you from the outside Go they can't get past the router unless you let them so it keeps the outside world out Which is good from a security standpoint, but it's bad for a lot of things.

532
00:42:25,558 --> 00:42:26,964
Rym: for example Bit torrent.

533
00:42:27,385 --> 00:42:31,640
Rym: you have to not go into details about bit torrent because we could do a show on this more specifically.

534
00:42:32,382 --> 00:42:33,188
Rym: Actually, let's be a good idea.

535
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:38,355
Rym: We do a separate show on Specific applications and what you should do to your router to make them work better.

536
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:41,127
Scott: Yeah, I don't know There's a lot mostly just port numbers.

537
00:42:41,408 --> 00:42:43,938
Rym: Yeah, but even then that's we could do a forum thread at least.

538
00:42:44,139 --> 00:42:51,640
Rym: yeah Because remember steam you got to do weird stuff to make steam work Only if you have more than one person playing games in the same house.

539
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:57,160
Rym: Yes, which is often the case with geeks it is because very few people have multiple IP addresses, it's true.

540
00:42:58,681 --> 00:43:02,660
Rym: So this is good from a security standpoint because it keeps all the outside out.

541
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:10,347
Rym: Nothing can get in unless your router is compromised bad firmware or a loophole or a security problem or whatever Which is kind of rare.

542
00:43:10,831 --> 00:43:11,919
Scott: that's almost never gonna happen.

543
00:43:12,442 --> 00:43:14,774
Rym: Oh, well, you staff and way back in the day wait bad not today.

544
00:43:14,794 --> 00:43:16,020
Scott: You're like not likely.

545
00:43:16,201 --> 00:43:24,240
Rym: Yeah, not likely at all not something you have to worry about Or two if you open up a hole to let stuff in now what if you want stuff to come in?

546
00:43:24,481 --> 00:43:26,711
Rym: I mean I said before my little FTP server.

547
00:43:26,992 --> 00:43:28,600
Rym: No one on the outside can connect to it.

548
00:43:28,922 --> 00:43:30,699
Rym: What if I want people to be able to connect to it?

549
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:35,680
Rym: How can I open it up so that stuff I want to get through can get through automatically?

550
00:43:36,102 --> 00:43:38,132
Rym: But yet all that cruft doesn't get through.

551
00:43:38,152 --> 00:43:39,660
Scott: Well, here's the answer.

552
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,850
Scott: The answer is something you may have heard of called port forwarding.

553
00:43:43,131 --> 00:43:44,435
Rym: now port forwarding is.

554
00:43:44,796 --> 00:43:52,636
Rym: I mean, it's not a misnomer But it might be misleading It's port forwarding in that it tells the router the net how to forward ports.

555
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:53,940
Rym: Normally is dynamic.

556
00:43:54,321 --> 00:44:10,760
Rym: So whenever I open a new connection the router assigns up an arbitrary port number to whatever I'm doing and it remembers that until whatever I'm doing is done a Static one a port forward is where you on your own very specifically define a port say port

557
00:44:12,521 --> 00:44:15,471
Scott: Yep, you go to the router and you say hey router and the router goes.

558
00:44:15,511 --> 00:44:15,732
Scott: what.

559
00:44:15,852 --> 00:44:24,858
Scott: and you say router if anyone tries to connect To you on port 443 you send whatever they're telling you over to computer number one.

560
00:44:24,979 --> 00:44:27,039
Scott: You hear me Alright, that's what you're gonna do now.

561
00:44:27,441 --> 00:44:39,018
Scott: So now normally if someone tried to connect on port 443 because anyone trying to connect to a NAT router the router goes What are you trying to connect to me from the wrong side for get away, but now it says oh wait you wanted 443, right?

562
00:44:39,821 --> 00:44:42,478
Scott: I'm gonna send that shit over to computer number a. that's what I'm gonna do.

563
00:44:43,121 --> 00:45:06,240
Scott: so if you had an FTP server on computer number a and you tell the router if it sees any traffic on port FTP and Send it over to computer number a now people can connect to your router on the FTP port and it would be just like Connecting to your computer on the FTP port because the router just sends all that stuff to the computer.

564
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:16,516
Rym: Now FTP right wasn't the best example because a lot of people out there in the world even professionals In fact a part of my job at IBM was fixing this.

565
00:45:16,536 --> 00:45:20,209
Rym: for people often There are two kinds of FTP passive and active.

566
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:21,293
Rym: not gonna get into it.

567
00:45:21,353 --> 00:45:22,336
Rym: It's kind of complicated.

568
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:30,160
Rym: suffice to say FTP as a protocol requires a little bit more fiddling than just opening a port forward in some situations.

569
00:45:30,562 --> 00:45:30,883
Scott: All right.

570
00:45:30,903 --> 00:45:32,088
Scott: So let's say you have a web server.

571
00:45:32,108 --> 00:45:34,900
Scott: There we go port 80 on port 80 on your computer.

572
00:45:35,301 --> 00:45:40,580
Scott: No one on the outside world can visit port 80 on your computer because it's hiding behind the router.

573
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:49,108
Scott: So you tell the router hey router if anyone's looking for port 80 you tell them to see me and you tell it which computer It want you want it to go to.

574
00:45:49,309 --> 00:46:05,605
Scott: so now if anyone connects to the router on port 80 The router goes to the web server and sends all the port 80 traffic that away and then the web pages go out and everything's happy As long as you don't have more than one computer that you want to be on port 80. because well you can't Only one computer per port.

575
00:46:05,645 --> 00:46:05,986
Scott: That's it.

576
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:08,113
Scott: Unless you do two nets.

577
00:46:08,856 --> 00:46:10,040
Rym: Oh, no, you can't do two nets.

578
00:46:10,343 --> 00:46:11,857
Scott: I think you can actually can't you?

579
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,047
Rym: well You can have any on a real router.

580
00:46:14,087 --> 00:46:18,826
Rym: you can have any number of IP addresses shared among your netting and you can do All sorts of fancy things.

581
00:46:19,228 --> 00:46:21,839
Rym: links is without special firmware hacks not so much.

582
00:46:22,101 --> 00:46:24,470
Scott: Well, couldn't you plug a links is into a links.

583
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:27,040
Rym: is that would not do what you think it would do?

584
00:46:27,321 --> 00:46:29,128
Rym: No, that is a terrible idea.

585
00:46:29,228 --> 00:46:30,212
Scott: I figured it would work.

586
00:46:30,252 --> 00:46:30,835
Scott: Wouldn't it work?

587
00:46:31,136 --> 00:46:32,079
Rym: How what would it do?

588
00:46:32,743 --> 00:46:35,380
Scott: Well, you just you'd have to make sure that they were different IPs.

589
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,142
Scott: I guess right?

590
00:46:36,523 --> 00:46:41,960
Rym: how would your external IP address have more than one port 80 if you'd had an added net?

591
00:46:42,705 --> 00:46:43,470
Scott: That is true.

592
00:46:43,491 --> 00:46:49,128
Scott: Yes That is true, yes, but it would.

593
00:46:49,208 --> 00:46:51,534
Scott: it would make an added net which is useless.

594
00:46:51,655 --> 00:46:53,380
Scott: it is useless, but it would work.

595
00:46:53,841 --> 00:46:59,180
Rym: Yeah, but anyway that is one of the issues one that you can't have more than one thing on a given port.

596
00:46:59,521 --> 00:47:05,400
Rym: That's why steam causes problems because by default steam always wants to connect back to your computer on the same port.

597
00:47:05,762 --> 00:47:11,890
Rym: So if you have three people in your house all trying to play steam at the same time Opening one port forward for that port.

598
00:47:12,071 --> 00:47:14,540
Rym: All right, which of my three computers do I point it at?

599
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,199
Rym: Because the other two people can't play on steam?

600
00:47:16,794 --> 00:47:32,412
Scott: Yep You need to do is you need to change the ports so that one person uses one port and one person uses another port and One person uses another port and you need to tell steam which ports to connect on so that it doesn't screw around Because if you all try to use the same port then it doesn't work at all.

601
00:47:32,653 --> 00:47:45,289
Rym: now granted that in many ways is a failing Of steam and Scott and I have argued a lot about this But I think that steam in many ways dealing with ports and networking was designed very poorly But we're not gonna get into that.

602
00:47:46,032 --> 00:47:48,000
Rym: This does present a security problem.

603
00:47:48,060 --> 00:48:00,132
Rym: However, when you open a port for forwarding because you have now circumvented the net for that one thing So say you open up port 443 and you point it at your your 443 computer that runs 443 stop.

604
00:48:00,714 --> 00:48:02,080
Rym: anything on the internet can hit that.

605
00:48:02,622 --> 00:48:07,180
Rym: So you have basically exposed your computer to the outside world in one little hole.

606
00:48:07,702 --> 00:48:14,447
Rym: So if there's an exploit that would have used port 443 to break in and it hits your router It'll hit that computers though.

607
00:48:14,467 --> 00:48:15,432
Rym: The router wasn't even there.

608
00:48:15,914 --> 00:48:17,160
Scott: Yeah, it's like you could open it.

609
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:25,860
Scott: You can poke a hole in the router on one port, you know And basically make a little hose that goes from that hole into one computer on your network on that port.

610
00:48:26,302 --> 00:48:34,420
Scott: And but now that protection that the router was giving you by keeping the bad stuff out Well any bad stuff that falls into that hole is gonna go straight through.

611
00:48:34,881 --> 00:48:37,931
Scott: So you got to be real careful when you port forward and when you don't.

612
00:48:38,272 --> 00:48:46,540
Scott: I highly recommend that if you are port forwarding Because you need to do something like that open up the port when you're using it and close it when you're not using it.

613
00:48:46,961 --> 00:48:48,608
Rym: That's really a giant pain in the ass.

614
00:48:48,649 --> 00:48:51,160
Scott: in most it is a pain in the ass, but it's still a good idea.

615
00:48:51,521 --> 00:48:55,312
Rym: Yeah more likely you're gonna open up the ports for things like bit torrent or steam.

616
00:48:55,694 --> 00:48:57,700
Rym: Yeah bit torrent is probably the number one.

617
00:48:58,062 --> 00:48:58,848
Rym: I'm not gonna get into it.

618
00:48:58,888 --> 00:48:59,653
Rym: You can just google around.

619
00:48:59,673 --> 00:49:00,540
Rym: There's a million guides.

620
00:49:00,821 --> 00:49:02,469
Rym: It'll tell you exactly what ports to use.

621
00:49:02,871 --> 00:49:13,240
Rym: or if you're using something like a serious you can tell bit torrent to use a Specific port for all incoming traffic and then tell your router to forward that one port to your computer and it can be arbitrary.

622
00:49:13,401 --> 00:49:16,600
Rym: So you pick a different one for every computer that'll use bit torrent and everyone's happy.

623
00:49:17,061 --> 00:49:33,719
Rym: there's really not much more we can talk about unless we go into the details of specific applications or if you wanted me to Talk at length about how exactly NAT works and how it Forwards these ports around and how it defines which ports to use and the different kinds of NAT and the business cases and the things That no one cares about.

624
00:49:34,202 --> 00:49:41,180
Scott: Mostly they don't care about them because unless you become a networking guy You don't need to know them to have your home network working with NAT.

625
00:49:41,502 --> 00:49:43,820
Scott: You only need to know what we've told you already.

626
00:49:44,443 --> 00:49:50,039
Scott: It makes it so that you can have one real IP address on the real internet But have many computers in your house.

627
00:49:50,702 --> 00:49:59,900
Scott: It makes it so that you're you can keep all the bad worms out and you can poke holes in it So that people can still connect to things that you might be hosting inside your house.

628
00:50:00,201 --> 00:50:10,820
Rym: it also had the added benefit of making sure we didn't run out of IP addresses because Thousands and thousands and thousands of computers all around the world don't have real external IP addresses.

629
00:50:11,161 --> 00:50:23,120
Scott: They share IP addresses and that way we still have enough IP addresses at least for now to go around and we don't need to Take the entire internet apart and rebuild it with ipv6 quite so soon because that's not gonna be fun.

630
00:50:23,884 --> 00:50:26,620
Rym: Yeah, well it is real fun for me because I love that stuff.

631
00:50:26,961 --> 00:50:29,712
Rym: I did a project tonight, but it's not gonna be fun for the internets.

632
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:30,595
Rym: No, it's not.

633
00:50:30,655 --> 00:50:31,840
Scott: It's like going to the doctor.

634
00:50:31,981 --> 00:50:33,899
Scott: It's good for you, but it's gonna hurt.

635
00:50:34,301 --> 00:50:39,820
Rym: Well plus as much as I like ipv6 is definitely not the perfect solution and it's not a perfect solution.

636
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:45,014
Rym: But there's no such thing as a perfect solution other than perfect AI and a semantic web and all that.

637
00:50:45,155 --> 00:50:45,375
Rym: Yep.

638
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:51,438
Scott: However, ipv6 Technic technologically speaking is cool is superior to ipv4.

639
00:50:58,123 --> 00:51:00,712
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

640
00:51:00,732 --> 00:51:02,860
