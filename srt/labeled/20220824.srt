1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,460
Rym: It's Wednesday, August 24th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:09,681
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:13,230
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,655
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,695 --> 00:00:18,510
Rym: Tonight we are talking about the feature films of Hayao Miyazaki.

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,808
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,151 --> 00:00:31,170
Scott: I did a whole bunch of stuff over the weekend that would have been Open-E-Bit on Monday, if I had remembered.

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,070
Rym: Well, I jumped in with my previous show, Open-E-Bits, that were long.

9
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:42,190
Scott: Right, so I tried to think, well, what happened over the weekend that could possibly be an Open-E-Bit?

10
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:49,070
Scott: Because, you know, my current job, I only work the four days a week, which is still incredible, even though I've been doing this for a couple months now.

11
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,030
Rym: So I gotta tell you, as a random aside, today I was-- It's pretty terrific.

12
00:00:52,290 --> 00:01:00,369
Rym: I was coaching a coworker, like, doing some mentoring, and we were talking, and they were like, "Yeah, I just feel like I work too

13
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:00,629
Rym: much.".

14
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,170
Rym: So I actually told them, like, you know, I got a friend, you know, the guy I do the podcast with.

15
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:05,975
Rym: He actually works four days a week.

16
00:01:05,995 --> 00:01:10,850
Rym: He totally pulled it off, and there was, like, the look on this person's face.

17
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:17,429
Rym: It's like they had never considered that this was even a possibility in their lives, and they got really excited about it.

18
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:22,310
Rym: And I don't think any company in capital markets would ever do something like that, but anyway.

19
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:28,727
Scott: Someone posted a thread on a website, and they said, "Ask, you know, anyone working a four day a week here as an

20
00:01:28,768 --> 00:01:29,149
Scott: employee?".

21
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,274
Scott: "This is a question mark.

22
00:01:30,294 --> 00:01:32,227
Scott: This is a question for salaried employees,

23
00:01:32,268 --> 00:01:32,388
Scott: etc.".

24
00:01:33,313 --> 00:01:34,679
Scott: And I was like, "Yes!

25
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:35,804
Scott: That is me!

26
00:01:36,065 --> 00:01:37,010
Scott: Here is how I did

27
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:37,090
Scott: it.".

28
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:37,716
Scott: And I got 171 upvotes.

29
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:44,007
Rym: I think you could just post an AMA and get surprising traction.

30
00:01:44,108 --> 00:01:44,690
Scott: Like, AMA!

31
00:01:45,274 --> 00:01:46,550
Scott: I only work four days a week.

32
00:01:47,353 --> 00:01:52,170
Rym: I only work four days a week, but I have a real job in a real company paying a normal salary.

33
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:57,450
Scott: Well, it's kind of a startup, but they're paying money, I guess, you know, as long as they don't run out.

34
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:02,870
Rym: I mean, I have been approached by startups that aren't even at that point.

35
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,323
Rym: They're like, "Yeah, we can't actually pay you in anything but

36
00:02:05,544 --> 00:02:05,886
Rym: equity.".

37
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:08,558
Scott: Yeah, no, they're paying real money.

38
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:11,510
Scott: They got from some investors, which usually I'm against, but obviously...

39
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,901
Rym: Even companies like Google and Amazon don't really pay in money.

40
00:02:14,942 --> 00:02:16,790
Rym: They mostly pay in stock.

41
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:28,030
Scott: But there's customers who are paying and, you know, I'm somewhat believing that the product has uses and has a chance of success, right?

42
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:28,750
Scott: That's exciting.

43
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,914
Scott: Obviously not a huge chance.

44
00:02:29,994 --> 00:02:32,022
Scott: It's still some startup, but not zero.

45
00:02:32,364 --> 00:02:33,850
Scott: It's not garbage, right?

46
00:02:34,874 --> 00:02:35,308
Scott: Not too shabby.

47
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:44,803
Scott: But yeah, so the weekend happened and most of the stuff that happened on the weekend is just, you know... I was doing stuff, but it was mostly personal stuff.

48
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:46,270
Scott: It's not stuff I'm going to talk about in an opening.

49
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:58,450
Scott: But one of the things I did over the weekend was there was a party and the person running the party hired some people to set up a balloon decoration at the party, right?

50
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:09,910
Scott: So when I woke up and I went outside, right, there were people blowing up a shit ton of balloons, tying them together, tying them to sticks and creating like an arch kind of deal, right?

51
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,424
Scott: You know, real fancy balloon decoration early in the morning.

52
00:03:13,565 --> 00:03:14,529
Scott: Not that early, like 10 a.m.

53
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:19,460
Scott: You know, and they set it up and it looks pretty good.

54
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,141
Scott: They did a good job.

55
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:23,549
Scott: And then they leave and the day goes on.

56
00:03:24,391 --> 00:03:29,488
Scott: A little while later, you know, I hear a pop and I'm like, yeah, balloons are going to pop, right?

57
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:30,070
Scott: There was no way.

58
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,252
Rym: I got a guess.

59
00:03:31,493 --> 00:03:33,419
Rym: I have no... Scott has not told me the story.

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,590
Rym: My guess is the air temperature was high.

61
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:37,892
Scott: Yeah, of course.

62
00:03:40,076 --> 00:03:48,670
Scott: But, you know, you knew that even if it was cold as crap, there's no way all the balloons are going to survive the whole day.

63
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:49,271
Rym: Oh, yeah.

64
00:03:50,053 --> 00:03:57,190
Scott: But, yeah, they did not under inflate as they should have, knowing the heat wave and the sun coming out.

65
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:06,290
Rym: I mean, every time I go to my bike, I look at, especially in this climate, I look at what the weather is going to be and I'll take five or 10 psi out of my bike tires, depending on the temperature.

66
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:07,572
Scott: Yeah.

67
00:04:07,692 --> 00:04:10,319
Scott: But, you know, there was there was popping throughout the day.

68
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,010
Scott: And then once the shade came right later in the day, the popping receded.

69
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,184
Scott: And, you know, also once the under inflated balloons are the only ones that were left.

70
00:04:18,264 --> 00:04:18,524
Scott: Right.

71
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:19,649
Scott: There was less popping.

72
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:19,890
Scott: Right.

73
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,276
Scott: There were some periods where there was a lot of popping.

74
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:26,449
Scott: But, you know, it's just interesting because the popping is like, well, they messed up.

75
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:26,910
Scott: Right.

76
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:31,144
Scott: They, you know, they'll learn their lesson the next time those balloon people set up a thing.

77
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:31,665
Scott: Right.

78
00:04:31,726 --> 00:04:32,950
Scott: And they won't make the mistake again.

79
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,540
Scott: They'll under inflate if they set up before the sun comes out, et cetera.

80
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,643
Scott: Yeah.

81
00:04:37,823 --> 00:04:39,468
Scott: And it's like, there's nothing we could do about it now.

82
00:04:39,528 --> 00:04:40,230
Scott: It's unfixable.

83
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:41,752
Scott: It's like, whatever.

84
00:04:43,015 --> 00:04:45,259
Scott: You know, the popping is not bothering or hurting anybody.

85
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,101
Scott: Whatever.

86
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:46,742
Scott: Right.

87
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:50,790
Scott: But, you know, some people were like, just so fustered by the popping.

88
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:54,424
Scott: And it's like, I could understand if someone had like a PTSD from loud noises.

89
00:04:54,485 --> 00:04:55,810
Scott: That's perfectly understandable.

90
00:04:56,732 --> 00:04:57,916
Rym: It was outdoors.

91
00:04:57,996 --> 00:05:03,170
Rym: So, balloons popping in an unobstructed outdoor area, unless they're Mylar balloons, not that loud.

92
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,353
Scott: No, they're normal.

93
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:07,549
Scott: These are like, you know, normal balloons, like rubbery, you know, the standard ones.

94
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:07,810
Scott: Right.

95
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,119
Scott: And it's like, some people are just like, you know, getting upset.

96
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,924
Scott: They're like, oh, we paid for these balloons.

97
00:05:14,004 --> 00:05:16,129
Rym: And I'm like, there's nothing we could do about it.

98
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:21,139
Rym: Well, that's that specific problem of people care way too much.

99
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,245
Scott: And like, is your anger going to improve this situation?

100
00:05:24,606 --> 00:05:26,570
Scott: Then just ignore it and go on with your life.

101
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,413
Rym: Oh, there's the amusement question.

102
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:28,777
Scott: You're going to throw these balloons away.

103
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,582
Scott: The party's only three hours long.

104
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:33,010
Scott: You're going to throw them all away in an hour anyway.

105
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:34,893
Scott: Why are you so mad?

106
00:05:34,913 --> 00:05:43,550
Rym: I feel like the correct response is to, like, if someone's like that and you want to just like stop it, just start yelling like, whoa, whoa, everybody, everybody, calm down, everyone be quiet.

107
00:05:44,671 --> 00:05:48,899
Rym: We have to end the party right now because the balloons might pop.

108
00:05:49,561 --> 00:05:50,282
Rym: Everybody go home.

109
00:05:50,402 --> 00:05:51,144
Rym: It's all over.

110
00:05:51,945 --> 00:05:54,090
Rym: Talk to Joey Jojo here who's bothered by this.

111
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,698
Scott: The way I see it is like, I see it as a benefit that the balloons pop.

112
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:03,385
Scott: And the way I see it that way is because, you know, what was that?

113
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:06,290
Scott: If that, let's say the balloon arch, no balloons popped.

114
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:11,330
Rym: You would never, you would never, I would never have known there was a balloon arch because you would not have said I was at this party.

115
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:11,670
Rym: Right.

116
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,394
Scott: And there would have looked nice.

117
00:06:13,575 --> 00:06:17,163
Scott: It would have looked nice and been there and been pleasant in its appearance.

118
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:18,526
Scott: And then it would have gone in the garbage.

119
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:19,027
Scott: Right.

120
00:06:19,148 --> 00:06:20,170
Scott: And that would have been the end of it.

121
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,472
Rym: I suppose there's a tiny chance.

122
00:06:21,492 --> 00:06:22,834
Scott: Because it popped.

123
00:06:23,255 --> 00:06:23,555
Scott: Right.

124
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:25,859
Scott: We now got a funny story.

125
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,910
Scott: And, you know, even as soon as next year or even sooner, you'll be like, ah, remember that time all the balloons are popping.

126
00:06:32,671 --> 00:06:37,476
Scott: That is more valuable than the day of balloons.

127
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:39,258
Scott: Now one could argue.

128
00:06:39,278 --> 00:06:40,280
Scott: Just being nice.

129
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,705
Rym: There is a possibility that the balloon art would have been so impressive.

130
00:06:45,165 --> 00:06:47,648
Rym: Like I was at a wedding once where for weeks.

131
00:06:47,748 --> 00:06:49,470
Scott: It was good, but it was not that impressive.

132
00:06:49,811 --> 00:06:53,096
Rym: There's a possibility a balloon arch could have been constructed in such a way.

133
00:06:53,116 --> 00:07:01,550
Rym: When I was a kid, we went to a wedding once and I remember all the adults for like months would keep bringing up how good the flowers were at this wedding.

134
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,354
Rym: Like it was just a thing among every adult we knew.

135
00:07:04,835 --> 00:07:08,020
Rym: But this actually gets us some extra benefit.

136
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,770
Rym: And this is relevant to my thing of the day because I was involved in a balloon related incident when I was a kid.

137
00:07:14,891 --> 00:07:18,601
Rym: And I know my mom is watching the live stream, so she's probably already laughing because she knows what happened.

138
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:19,543
Rym: We were in...

139
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,950
Scott: You grabbed too many helium balloons and flew away?

140
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,653
Rym: It's actually relevant to your thing of the day as well.

141
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:39,210
Rym: So we were in the fancy mall, not the one in Detroit that we would go to like for normal stuff, but like the fancy mall the family would go to for like, we're going to go shopping on a Sunday, like drive out to the suburbs and go to the big fancy new mall.

142
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:45,239
Rym: And I had this Mylar balloon and I'm walking around with it like a little kid, you know, really, really happy about it.

143
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,623
Rym: And I turned to my parents and I'm just like, can I pop it?

144
00:07:48,124 --> 00:07:50,147
Rym: And they're not paying super attention to me.

145
00:07:50,588 --> 00:07:51,670
Rym: So they're just like, yeah, yeah, whatever.

146
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:55,701
Rym: So I just, as a kid, I put this balloon on the ground and I stomp on it.

147
00:07:57,065 --> 00:07:58,570
Rym: It is so loud.

148
00:07:59,481 --> 00:07:59,730
Scott: Oh yeah.

149
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,734
Rym: It sounds like a for real gun went off.

150
00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:05,056
Rym: Everybody goes silent.

151
00:08:05,096 --> 00:08:06,818
Rym: People in the distance start yelling.

152
00:08:06,838 --> 00:08:08,480
Rym: A stampede starts.

153
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:11,604
Rym: It is just like chaos everywhere.

154
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:16,530
Rym: And my parents very intelligently are just like, keep walking, get up, keep walking, don't acknowledge it.

155
00:08:17,852 --> 00:08:23,605
Rym: And we're trying to just not be involved in any of this chaos that we have caused.

156
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:25,970
Rym: and it's trying to get out of the mall.

157
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,367
Scott: Correct move.

158
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,853
Rym: Long story short, we did meet some police.

159
00:08:31,154 --> 00:08:33,517
Rym: They determined that no foul happened.

160
00:08:33,616 --> 00:08:34,518
Rym: Everybody calmed down.

161
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,679
Rym: No one was injured.

162
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:44,049
Rym: And my advice to you is to not randomly pop a Mylar balloon in a giant echoey eighties mall.

163
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,573
Rym: Unless you desire this outcome, in which case

164
00:08:48,793 --> 00:09:03,470
Scott: my advice to you would be if you're going to inflate balloons outside in warm weather and it's not at the peak warmth of the day or and or the balloons are going to be in direct sunlight, you should under inflate them.

165
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:20,750
Rym: I would say if you are a person who has access to public schooling in America, pay a little bit of attention in like middle school pre physics, but in your life, you might know the physics, but you just might not think of that.

166
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:21,171
Scott: Right.

167
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:23,837
Scott: It's not about not knowing hot air expands.

168
00:09:23,877 --> 00:09:29,630
Scott: It's about having that come to your mind and like thinking about that moment when you're inflating balloons.

169
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:30,071
Scott: Right.

170
00:09:30,131 --> 00:09:30,753
Scott: It's not about.

171
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,958
Scott: it's like, yeah, you know, hot air expands.

172
00:09:33,018 --> 00:09:33,399
Scott: And it's like.

173
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:34,822
Scott: but it's like, what?

174
00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:36,566
Scott: Why would you think of that at this moment?

175
00:09:36,647 --> 00:09:37,649
Scott: There's nothing you know.

176
00:09:40,451 --> 00:09:45,498
Rym: So in the news, there's actually we had a ton of news, which I won't try to dwell on all of it, but I want to start it.

177
00:09:45,538 --> 00:09:46,400
Scott: We can do pretty quick.

178
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:46,740
Rym: Yeah.

179
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:53,370
Rym: But I will start with one non animation anime manga comics news because it's actually a huge deal.

180
00:09:53,991 --> 00:10:06,630
Rym: The United States, our president, Joe Biden, basically just signed an order that cancels arguably the majority of people's student loans in America.

181
00:10:07,371 --> 00:10:12,638
Rym: A lot of it, a significant the far majority of all student loans are ten thousand dollars or less right now.

182
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:20,530
Scott: Meanwhile, all the countries with just free secondary education are like, oh, yeah, believe me, college should be free.

183
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,113
Rym: It should continue from high school for anyone who wants it.

184
00:10:23,354 --> 00:10:24,175
Rym: But I digress.

185
00:10:24,535 --> 00:10:28,200
Rym: But at least the public ones, I guess this is a huge deal.

186
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:35,250
Rym: And if you have student loans, pay attention to this, because the reason I'm making my news is I have a couple of reasons.

187
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:42,260
Rym: One, a lot of people who maybe don't understand much about American politics but are mad about it.

188
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,722
Rym: It's fine to be mad about it.

189
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:45,585
Rym: It's even fine to not understand it.

190
00:10:45,905 --> 00:10:49,370
Rym: But don't be publicly mad about things you don't understand if you're going to be wrong.

191
00:10:50,611 --> 00:10:51,835
Rym: He said he was going to do it.

192
00:10:52,176 --> 00:10:54,584
Rym: People were swearing up and down he would never do it.

193
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:55,507
Rym: And he did it.

194
00:10:55,728 --> 00:10:56,290
Rym: So that's one.

195
00:10:57,071 --> 00:10:58,027
Scott: He did it kind of.

196
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,174
Rym: Yeah, well, I mean, he did it.

197
00:10:59,355 --> 00:11:02,290
Rym: This is this is obviously only the first step.

198
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:03,850
Scott: You didn't cancel all student loans, period.

199
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,492
Rym: Yeah, that's common.

200
00:11:05,512 --> 00:11:07,034
Rym: I would say we give that time.

201
00:11:07,054 --> 00:11:16,407
Rym: But two, much more important, the ten thousand dollar limit and the Pell Grant limit that everyone's talking about, that is only the tip of the iceberg.

202
00:11:16,447 --> 00:11:18,710
Rym: That is actually not the most important part of this.

203
00:11:19,131 --> 00:11:24,043
Scott: The other parts are extra parts in the fine print that were not publicized enough.

204
00:11:24,203 --> 00:11:25,226
Scott: Well, I think they were.

205
00:11:25,447 --> 00:11:26,389
Scott: they were publicized.

206
00:11:26,469 --> 00:11:26,830
Rym: fine.

207
00:11:27,351 --> 00:11:34,150
Rym: The problem is the media didn't talk about them because they're kind of complicated and the people who are affected by them don't understand them.

208
00:11:34,631 --> 00:11:41,930
Rym: But basically, it is so much more than just canceling ten grand of student debt that it's going to cap interest.

209
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:50,770
Rym: It raises by a huge, huge margin, like what income they are allowed to just talk to you and give you a discretionary exemption.

210
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:55,077
Rym: It forgives loans less than 12K remaining.

211
00:11:55,598 --> 00:11:59,786
Rym: If after 10 years you still haven't paid off that last bit, excess interest.

212
00:12:00,027 --> 00:12:01,730
Rym: There is so much going on in this bill.

213
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,009
Rym: I would say go to the government website.

214
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,579
Rym: Well, yeah, it's an order, which is because that's actually kind of relevant.

215
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,164
Rym: We can't pass bills like this.

216
00:12:09,284 --> 00:12:11,030
Rym: There's literally no way to pass a bill like this.

217
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:17,910
Rym: So the only way we can do this is an executive order, which means there are limits to exactly how far it can go.

218
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,076
Rym: But this is a huge goddamn deal.

219
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,870
Rym: I would say go to the government website to check out exactly how it affects you.

220
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,538
Scott: If you're a United States person who has student loans left.

221
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,130
Scott: However, I hope you didn't refinance them with some non-government place.

222
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:31,771
Rym: Oh, yeah.

223
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:37,565
Rym: However, one, that government website is down the fuck down right now.

224
00:12:37,585 --> 00:12:39,790
Rym: So give it a few days.

225
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:53,710
Rym: And two, if there is, I doubt there's anyone listening to this podcast who believes this, but if you're the kind of person who somehow thinks this is unfair, especially because you paid off your student loans and you're mad that other people...

226
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:54,710
Scott: I paid off my student loans.

227
00:12:54,931 --> 00:12:55,569
Rym: I paid off mine.

228
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,990
Scott: But I wouldn't even be able to get this because I make too much money.

229
00:12:59,070 --> 00:12:59,311
Scott: Yeah.

230
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:02,477
Rym: But I would say if you're mad about this, you're a prick.

231
00:13:03,038 --> 00:13:09,530
Rym: If I'm not going to make an economic argument or a political argument, you are just a bad person who wants people to suffer for no reason.

232
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:17,825
Scott: You just believe that because, right, it's like you had to suffer and therefore you believe other people should also suffer.

233
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:18,226
Scott: Right.

234
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:19,809
Scott: It's like you're just a piece of shit.

235
00:13:20,391 --> 00:13:21,508
Scott: People who really suffer.

236
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:28,010
Rym: If we diverted the trolley to the track with no one on it, it wouldn't be fair to all the people the trolley already killed.

237
00:13:28,711 --> 00:13:28,932
Scott: Right.

238
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:30,976
Scott: It's like most people who really suffer.

239
00:13:31,016 --> 00:13:31,637
Scott: Right.

240
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:37,007
Scott: They, you know, it's like they say no one else should ever have to suffer like I suffered.

241
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:38,270
Scott: That's what a good person says.

242
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:38,470
Scott: Oh yeah.

243
00:13:39,171 --> 00:13:47,002
Scott: If you say, right, I suffered so you should also have to suffer, you're a bad person who's not good for society.

244
00:13:47,162 --> 00:13:49,205
Scott: We should either fix you or get rid of you or something.

245
00:13:49,265 --> 00:13:49,706
Scott: Right.

246
00:13:49,726 --> 00:13:50,447
Scott: You got problems.

247
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:51,549
Scott: You're the problem with the world.

248
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:52,430
Scott: Get the hell out of here.

249
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:59,083
Scott: There are some people who are concerned about inflation, which I guess is not entirely wrong.

250
00:13:59,224 --> 00:14:02,450
Scott: There is some amount of truth there.

251
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:10,303
Scott: But what I would say to them is that, okay, let's, you know, y'all just give them, I'll just give it to them.

252
00:14:10,404 --> 00:14:10,624
Scott: Okay.

253
00:14:10,664 --> 00:14:12,407
Scott: Let's say that, what, $300 billion, whatever, you know.

254
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,037
Rym: Oh, you're using one of my favorite rhetorical constructs.

255
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:17,498
Rym: All right.

256
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:19,343
Rym: I'll agree to 90% of what you said.

257
00:14:19,624 --> 00:14:21,749
Rym: just to get to the part that's the stupidest thing you said.

258
00:14:22,471 --> 00:14:22,991
Scott: Exactly.

259
00:14:23,052 --> 00:14:23,212
Scott: Right.

260
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:28,640
Scott: So we're just going to let you pretend that, that the thing that's not true, that you're arguing for is true.

261
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,100
Scott: Right.

262
00:14:29,121 --> 00:14:33,707
Scott: Cause that's how wrong you are is that we can pretend that your assertion is true when it's not.

263
00:14:34,148 --> 00:14:35,230
Scott: And you'll still be wrong.

264
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:35,470
Scott: Right.

265
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:42,610
Scott: Let's say that this, this is the equivalent of just printing $300 billion, which would cause some amount of inflation.

266
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,490
Rym: I mean, one that rounds down to zero in terms of like how money works.

267
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:58,310
Scott: If you're really concerned about that, right, that amount of inflation and in that printing of that money, this is a much better way to spend $300 billion than a lot of things in the U S budget.

268
00:14:58,651 --> 00:15:05,824
Scott: You should instead argue for cutting the defense budget by $300 billion for one year or $30 billion a year for 10 years or something like that.

269
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:30,250
Scott: And so if you are saying that this is the inflation problem, you're basically saying that helping people whose lives are incredibly burdened and uplifting all of society is a worse way to spend money than bombs or subsidies to big companies or any of the other awful things.

270
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:45,530
Rym: I won't even grant people the, well, we could cut defense spending because the reality is we could not only keep defense spending at the level it is, but radically increase it and, and homelessness and, and hunger and of universal healthcare in America.

271
00:15:46,492 --> 00:15:50,849
Rym: And all we'd have to do is raise taxes on the very rich by not even that much.

272
00:15:51,511 --> 00:15:51,671
Scott: Yeah.

273
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:57,643
Scott: If you're worried about inflation, then you should just say, okay, canceling student loans is good.

274
00:15:57,903 --> 00:16:01,490
Scott: And then we should raise some taxes to make up for it, which would cancel out.

275
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:07,860
Scott: Why don't we just delete, delete favor of raising the taxes on the rich and that why are you against the student loan thing?

276
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,770
Scott: Why don't you just argue for, if the inflation is your concern, just argue for something else, right?

277
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:17,963
Scott: Like cutting spending or raising taxes to balance it out.

278
00:16:18,003 --> 00:16:20,270
Scott: Don't argue against the student loan spending.

279
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:27,810
Rym: Pay off the student loans and delete an equivalent amount of money from the hundred, from the thousand highest balance saving accounts in America.

280
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,690
Scott: Right.

281
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:43,250
Scott: The point is if someone is arguing, you know, for the, with the inflation argument, trying to hide the fact that they're a prick, the fact that their solution is to get rid of the student loan spending and not some other solution to cancel it out.

282
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,938
Scott: Inflation wise shows they're just hiding.

283
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,850
Scott: the truth is that they believe that I suffered, therefore you should suffer.

284
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,092
Rym: Well, similarly.

285
00:16:51,473 --> 00:16:57,786
Rym: So people who are mad about this, who are saying, well, I shouldn't have to pay for someone else's student loan.

286
00:16:57,806 --> 00:16:58,548
Rym: Let's skip the.

287
00:16:58,808 --> 00:16:59,630
Rym: you're a bad person.

288
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,723
Scott: You pay for everyone else's social security.

289
00:17:01,784 --> 00:17:02,690
Scott: You pay for everyone else.

290
00:17:03,972 --> 00:17:12,829
Rym: Because how this is actually being paid for, uh, effectively there are people who will pay for these loans through taxes and people who won't.

291
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:20,962
Rym: Anyone who is, who says they have to pay for these is already a multimillionaire or billionaire.

292
00:17:21,342 --> 00:17:26,150
Rym: And most of the people who are mad about this will pay zero more dollars in taxes.

293
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:27,609
Scott: Yeah.

294
00:17:28,951 --> 00:17:30,052
Scott: So, uh, yeah.

295
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:31,754
Rym: Getting into some, uh, anime news.

296
00:17:32,154 --> 00:17:33,915
Rym: Uh, you just watched the documentary.

297
00:17:34,035 --> 00:17:35,396
Rym: We've talked about this before.

298
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:53,190
Rym: I don't need to say much about it, but if you are unaware of the live action animated crossover sailor moon that was, that they tried to produce for American TV and then scrapped, but they filmed a whole pilot, uh, Mike tool, you'd like to show the clips that you've all seen from this thing.

299
00:17:53,750 --> 00:18:00,559
Rym: Well, uh, someone found the entire pilots, the entire library of Congress.

300
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,360
Scott: I think they found it.

301
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:09,510
Rym: They found it in the library of Congress, the entire episode, all the footage, and they not only published it, but they put, they made a documentary about it.

302
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:10,551
Scott: Yep.

303
00:18:11,412 --> 00:18:26,130
Scott: If you don't know about it, basically there was, you know, a children's animation company back in the day that, you know, tried to make a U S version of sailor moon, get rid of all the Japanese stuff and make it palatable to a multicultural American audience.

304
00:18:26,511 --> 00:18:28,894
Rym: That was the target demographic of kids TV.

305
00:18:28,914 --> 00:18:33,760
Scott: Uh, well, they weren't doing that, you know, cause the original sailor moon was palatable.

306
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,405
Scott: They were just making it palatable to their own adult senses.

307
00:18:37,565 --> 00:18:37,805
Scott: Right.

308
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,528
Scott: Of what's American advertisers are.

309
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:41,951
Scott: Yeah.

310
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:42,992
Rym: Palatable to what?

311
00:18:43,192 --> 00:18:45,856
Rym: producers of entertainment, racist people.

312
00:18:46,196 --> 00:18:47,638
Scott: I don't know.

313
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:48,659
Rym: It's bad.

314
00:18:48,739 --> 00:18:48,980
Rym: Yeah.

315
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:56,790
Scott: They, you know, and it, it never started, but they, they met, they produced the one, the one thing, and now we can watch that one thing.

316
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:57,631
Rym: Yup.

317
00:18:57,891 --> 00:19:02,554
Rym: And, uh, we'll see, we'll see if any, if we ever talk about this again, but you can watch it.

318
00:19:02,614 --> 00:19:03,795
Scott: It's a fascinating history.

319
00:19:04,055 --> 00:19:04,335
Rym: It is.

320
00:19:04,415 --> 00:19:05,216
Rym: It absolutely is.

321
00:19:05,856 --> 00:19:08,258
Rym: Uh, real quick, I got a mini geek bite here.

322
00:19:08,378 --> 00:19:18,966
Rym: As you all know, I was a big fan of Beavis and Butthead when I was young, uh, much like that for a hundred D. The reason I got into Beavis and Butthead is because my mom actually got me and my little brother to watch it.

323
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:20,167
Rym: Like when it first aired.

324
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:23,069
Scott: I watched it a bit, but I wasn't that into it.

325
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:24,790
Rym: The family would sit around and watch it.

326
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,312
Rym: This was, this was as important as the Simpsons to us as a family.

327
00:19:28,893 --> 00:19:34,196
Rym: So, but I'll say is Beavis and Butthead was rebooted once, but it was rebooted again recently.

328
00:19:34,517 --> 00:19:37,819
Rym: The first season of the new Beavis and Butthead is airing right now.

329
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,180
Rym: You can watch it on Paramount Plus.

330
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,922
Rym: Uh, I think there's like four episodes that are out so far total.

331
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:47,486
Rym: And as a brief geek bite, I will say one, it is hilarious.

332
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,167
Rym: Two, it is worth watching.

333
00:19:49,587 --> 00:19:53,950
Rym: Three, it is deeply a spiritual successor.

334
00:19:54,070 --> 00:20:01,676
Rym: Like it is true to what made Beavis and Butthead funny in the old days, but it has advanced the writing.

335
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:03,118
Rym: Like the writing's a little better.

336
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,119
Rym: It has more modern sensibilities.

337
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:11,124
Rym: Uh, they've excised some of the grosser and less entertaining or more dated parts of Beavis and Butthead.

338
00:20:11,885 --> 00:20:17,830
Rym: Uh, and it almost has a Looney Tunes style of humor in terms of how situations escalate.

339
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,711
Rym: It is dense with comedy.

340
00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:22,333
Rym: Uh, I'm going to watch every goddamn episode of this.

341
00:20:22,913 --> 00:20:37,183
Rym: And the most important thing, they have continued, they brought back the part of Beavis and Butthead that was actually the most important part, which was not the cartoon itself, but the meta show where it's just them on the couch watching music videos and making fun of them.

342
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:38,544
Rym: They still have that.

343
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,525
Rym: Sometimes they watch music videos.

344
00:20:40,846 --> 00:20:45,229
Rym: Sometimes they're watching whatever YouTube videos or TikToks are viral at any given time.

345
00:20:45,629 --> 00:20:47,170
Rym: And if you see nothing else from the show.

346
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,792
Scott: Are they paying to license those TikToks?

347
00:20:50,192 --> 00:20:50,533
Scott: Yes.

348
00:20:51,854 --> 00:20:54,997
Rym: If you watch nothing else, find the clip.

349
00:20:55,017 --> 00:21:05,105
Scott: I guess if you make a TikTok and then Beavis and Butthead tries to include it in their episode, they only have to pay TikTok and not you because TikTok turns to service.

350
00:21:05,145 --> 00:21:06,406
Scott: They own that shit, right?

351
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:07,267
Scott: So that sucks.

352
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,849
Scott: But I guess you get some fame, maybe?

353
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:10,870
Rym: I think you'd get some fame.

354
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:20,044
Rym: So the one clip you should watch, if you're not sure if you'd like this or not, Beavis and Butthead, watch one of those ASMR videos.

355
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:24,030
Rym: And it is a peak moment of comedy, this segment.

356
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:27,512
Rym: You got any news?

357
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:29,435
Scott: We got some more news.

358
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,238
Scott: So Paprika, right?

359
00:21:31,258 --> 00:21:35,065
Scott: The last Satoshi Kon movie was based on a book, right?

360
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,228
Scott: The book was by, what was that guy's name?

361
00:21:37,248 --> 00:21:38,230
Scott: Tsutsui, I think?

362
00:21:39,211 --> 00:21:40,393
Rym: Uh, do you think so?

363
00:21:41,594 --> 00:21:43,636
Scott: Yeah, I never remember his first name, right?

364
00:21:43,676 --> 00:21:47,341
Scott: But basically he's this really famous Japanese, like, contemporary sci-fi author.

365
00:21:48,382 --> 00:21:55,130
Scott: And he also, I believe, wrote Girl Who Leapt Through Time, the book, whatever it was based on, I believe, same author.

366
00:21:56,711 --> 00:22:08,530
Scott: Anyway, so somebody is going to make a Hollywood live action series based on the book that Paprika was based on by the novelist Tsutsui.

367
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:27,810
Scott: And obviously, even though that technically means that there's no connection to Paprika the movie, right, they obviously are going to use the fact that Paprika is a great movie based on the same work as part of the hype for their series that they're making.

368
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:35,361
Rym: Total aside, I'm just going to read what the listener just typed, because in this case the listener is my mom.

369
00:22:35,982 --> 00:22:38,146
Rym: Late to the stream, oh my god, the balloon story.

370
00:22:38,206 --> 00:22:40,510
Rym: I will never forget the whole mall panic it caused.

371
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,313
Scott: Alright, so that's the thing that's happening.

372
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:51,383
Rym: There are, I would say, charitably, there is a wide range of how this is going to go, this show.

373
00:22:52,224 --> 00:22:55,068
Rym: This could be terrible, this could be amazing.

374
00:22:55,809 --> 00:22:56,510
Rym: We'll just have to see.

375
00:22:57,491 --> 00:23:03,504
Scott: I would like to see, because I've heard about this author quite a few times and never actually read any of their books.

376
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:06,190
Scott: I don't know how many, if any, are available in English.

377
00:23:06,771 --> 00:23:15,610
Scott: But I would like to see this author, maybe if they get elevated to the Murakami level, or at least the level where their books all come out in English and I can read them.

378
00:23:16,512 --> 00:23:22,482
Scott: Because it seems like a lot of people have taken a lot of interest in this author's works.

379
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:27,070
Scott: And I remember when I was watching the Satoshi Kon documentary, there was a lot of mention of this author.

380
00:23:28,391 --> 00:23:33,210
Scott: And like Satoshi Kon, often blurs the line between fiction and reality.

381
00:23:34,951 --> 00:23:44,970
Rym: Plus, randomly, Harley Quinn, the show, just had a weirdly long reference to 1Q84 because all the characters are into it and reading it, just in an episode for some reason.

382
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:46,530
Rym: What the hell?

383
00:23:47,412 --> 00:23:49,929
Rym: That show's actually pretty good and you would probably enjoy it.

384
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:59,145
Scott: Anyway, in other news, in the United States, we have these mega movie theaters all everywhere, owned by a few chains.

385
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:01,850
Scott: And AMC, I think, is the biggest one.

386
00:24:02,253 --> 00:24:03,869
Rym: Also the bankruptest one.

387
00:24:05,331 --> 00:24:06,212
Scott: Right.

388
00:24:06,592 --> 00:24:13,762
Scott: So AMC was sort of in on the GameStop stock shenanigans, and what they're doing is they're going harder on those shenanigans.

389
00:24:13,782 --> 00:24:19,350
Scott: They're creating some security of some kind called ape, right?

390
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:25,350
Rym: Now obviously they are referencing bored ape NFT bullshit without saying it out loud.

391
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:34,750
Scott: I think it's that the people who were all in on AMC stock around the GameStop time also coincidentally called themselves ape, apes, right?

392
00:24:35,591 --> 00:24:40,670
Scott: Which might have stood for something, like AMC proppers, I don't know.

393
00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:50,725
Scott: Yeah, but there's definitely a cultural commonality between that group and the NFT groups of people, right?

394
00:24:50,745 --> 00:24:52,969
Scott: There's clearly the same crowd, right?

395
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:53,850
Scott: It's the same humans.

396
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:58,409
Scott: Anyway, but yeah, they're going to sell some kind of security called ape as the symbol.

397
00:24:59,212 --> 00:25:00,156
Rym: I didn't read all the details.

398
00:25:00,196 --> 00:25:02,970
Rym: I'm pretty sure it's a preferred stock of some kind.

399
00:25:03,756 --> 00:25:04,668
Scott: I don't know what the deal is.

400
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,589
Rym: Here's the best way I'm going to try to explain this in like...

401
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:10,690
Scott: As far as I can tell, it's a scam to just get money from fools.

402
00:25:13,014 --> 00:25:20,310
Rym: In my personal opinion, but not the opinion of any employer I may work for or have worked for in the past, this is probably a scam.

403
00:25:20,891 --> 00:25:31,790
Rym: But the way the rules work is, I would say, in my opinion, companies like AMC, you can tell when I'm thinking about what the lawyer would say if he was standing over my back.

404
00:25:33,191 --> 00:25:38,750
Rym: They have to do this by the book and be very transparent about what they're doing and why.

405
00:25:39,451 --> 00:25:56,710
Rym: And all the dipshit investors who are buying these meme stocks, who have no idea how the stock market works, are basically giving them cover to fleece people because they can point to their stock price and point to this interest and say, "Because of that, we are doing

406
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:56,930
Rym: this.".

407
00:25:57,511 --> 00:26:08,629
Rym: And the SEC has to look at it and say, "Yeah, I guess technically that is true because we can't actually take action against you just because a whole bunch of people are extremely

408
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:08,930
Rym: stupid.".

409
00:26:10,831 --> 00:26:17,590
Scott: So that's happening, but at the same time, Regal Cinema, another major big time theater chain, might be going bankrupt.

410
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,778
Rym: Theaters across the country are going bankrupt.

411
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:21,963
Rym: We've talked about this on GeekNights.

412
00:26:22,244 --> 00:26:23,830
Rym: for as long as GeekNights has been going.

413
00:26:24,371 --> 00:26:35,046
Rym: I remember, even when we were living in Beacon, every movie theater anywhere near us, if we ever went to the movies, there'd be like two people in the theater with us, even back then, at any time.

414
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,630
Rym: Weekends, weekdays, any time, no one was at the theater.

415
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:38,811
Scott: Nope.

416
00:26:40,574 --> 00:26:47,967
Scott: So yeah, that's, you know, theaters, you know, we thought theaters were in trouble during the pandemic times, but now those, you know, are the pandemic times over?

417
00:26:48,287 --> 00:26:49,850
Scott: No, they're not, not even close.

418
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:54,098
Scott: But, you know, people have largely come outside, right?

419
00:26:54,138 --> 00:27:00,270
Scott: People are going to the movies and I guess they don't miss going, most people don't seem to miss going to the theater that much.

420
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:05,610
Scott: I think going to the theater will mostly be a thing for people who really care about that sort of thing.

421
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:10,521
Rym: I like to go to the theater for big movies I care about.

422
00:27:10,581 --> 00:27:12,706
Rym: Like I'll go see Dune in the theater at some point.

423
00:27:13,107 --> 00:27:14,290
Rym: I'm sure it'll be in the theater again.

424
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:19,614
Scott: I think, you know, the point is there's going to still be a theater going crowd.

425
00:27:19,694 --> 00:27:33,570
Scott: It will reduce over time and it'll, you know, there'll be the, you know, certain special places that have a theater for, you know, special runs of things and then other things, just most people might not ever go to one, right?

426
00:27:35,272 --> 00:27:47,207
Rym: In some tragic news, a gentleman who most of you would probably know as the voice actor of Fuyutsuki in Evangelion, Motomu Kiyokawa has passed away at the age of 87.

427
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,329
Rym: Once again, Godspeed.

428
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:51,070
Scott: I'll take 87.

429
00:27:51,070 --> 00:28:00,949
Rym: Every time I see someone who was famous and popular and seemed like a good person and seemed to be in good health and made it like past 80 something, I would take that.

430
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:01,630
Rym: Absolutely.

431
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:02,631
Scott: Yep.

432
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:10,370
Scott: But yeah, if you look at the photos of the dude, I've never seen the guy before in my life or even a photo of him until now.

433
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,693
Rym: He kind of looks like my grandma.

434
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,646
Rym: Like I'm not even joking.

435
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:16,950
Rym: He kind of looks like my grandma.

436
00:28:18,211 --> 00:28:22,470
Scott: But he's definitely got that, you know, cool old Japanese guy style, right?

437
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,169
Rym: I think it's because he's wearing the same glasses my grandma always wore.

438
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,412
Scott: The gradient, right?

439
00:28:26,713 --> 00:28:29,578
Scott: You know, the cool suit and whatever.

440
00:28:29,818 --> 00:28:34,026
Scott: But it's like you look at this guy, you could probably guess he's the voice actor of Fuyutsuki.

441
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,310
Scott: just looking at this photo, right?

442
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:41,905
Scott: And it's like, you know, just looking at that photo gives me the feeling like that was one badass dude.

443
00:28:41,925 --> 00:28:42,326
Scott: Anyway.

444
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,676
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

445
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:54,963
Rym: So I said this was also relevant to my opening bit.

446
00:28:55,404 --> 00:28:58,410
Rym: So for those of you who are somehow unaware, I grew up in Detroit.

447
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:03,500
Rym: Detroit was an interesting place when I was a kid in the 80s.

448
00:29:03,941 --> 00:29:05,765
Rym: But there's a place in Detroit.

449
00:29:05,966 --> 00:29:06,226
Rym: It is.

450
00:29:06,467 --> 00:29:07,670
Rym: Detroit's a fascinating place.

451
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:25,350
Rym: I think Detroit will be a very important city in the years to come because Detroit might be, and Chicago together, are the biggest real cities in the world that are in some of the places that are geographically the safest from climate change the longest.

452
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:27,078
Scott: Okay.

453
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:38,570
Rym: So if you haven't lived in Detroit, you've probably never heard of Belle Isle, which is basically this island that's like in the Detroit River between Detroit and Canada.

454
00:29:40,191 --> 00:29:41,621
Rym: It's like a giant park.

455
00:29:41,641 --> 00:29:42,950
Rym: It's like this giant park island.

456
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:44,674
Scott: We looked it up.

457
00:29:44,735 --> 00:29:45,883
Scott: It's five square miles.

458
00:29:45,943 --> 00:29:46,910
Scott: So it's kind of big, actually.

459
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,592
Rym: It is kind of big.

460
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,859
Rym: When I was a kid, it had a reputation for a few things.

461
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:55,790
Rym: One, a lot of violence happened there, like a lot of gang shootings, a lot of fights, a lot of trouble.

462
00:29:57,131 --> 00:29:59,376
Rym: There were fallow deer that used to live on the island.

463
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:00,740
Rym: I'm pretty sure they're all gone now.

464
00:30:01,081 --> 00:30:04,470
Rym: There were a lot of nature parks, like there'd be field trips there that we'd go to as kids.

465
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,655
Rym: But there was this thing.

466
00:30:06,695 --> 00:30:10,243
Rym: It was built in like 1966 or 1967 that we just used to call the Belle Isle Slide.

467
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:21,050
Rym: It is just this gigantic, dangerous-as-shit metal slide that you would just get in a burlap sack and ride.

468
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,943
Scott: Now, there's plenty of big slides that you ride in a burlap sack.

469
00:30:24,984 --> 00:30:26,169
Rym: I've done that tons of times.

470
00:30:30,051 --> 00:30:38,689
Rym: This is the kind of thing, if you saw a video of this, even without seeing the danger of it, the first thing you would think is, "Oh, is that an action

471
00:30:38,729 --> 00:30:38,910
Rym: park?".

472
00:30:40,052 --> 00:30:43,630
Rym: I would be hard-pressed to argue against that if I didn't know the Belle Isle existed.

473
00:30:44,312 --> 00:30:46,490
Scott: Action Park had an alpine slide, even more dangerous.

474
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:54,870
Rym: Fun fact, more people are injured at ski resorts on the alpine slides than are ever injured at ski resorts actually skiing.

475
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:58,390
Scott: And that's a large amount because a lot of people are injured skiing.

476
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,117
Rym: Do not ever get on an alpine slide.

477
00:31:01,137 --> 00:31:04,550
Rym: But anyway, do not ride the giant slide at Belle Isle either.

478
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,460
Rym: So I guess it closed.

479
00:31:06,642 --> 00:31:07,569
Rym: I rode this as a kid.

480
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:15,910
Rym: Stories of its danger and its jankiness are not unfounded, nor are they exaggerated.

481
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:21,242
Rym: But this thing was closed in like 1994.

482
00:31:21,242 --> 00:31:22,345
Rym: I think it was closed until 2014.

483
00:31:22,345 --> 00:31:24,290
Rym: They opened it again, they closed it again.

484
00:31:25,972 --> 00:31:29,749
Rym: Long story short, it is now a meme, and the whole world knows about it.

485
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:32,109
Scott: A pile of rubble is what it should be.

486
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:48,270
Rym: So Detroit rapper GM Cash wrote a song about the slide, and what I'm going to link to is a tweet where someone has taken this song and juxtaposed it with images of this slide when it just reopened.

487
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:53,050
Rym: I think Jimmy Kimmel even talked about it, so this is looming large in pop culture out of nowhere.

488
00:31:53,670 --> 00:32:00,810
Rym: Basically, they reopened it, they polished it too much when they cleaned it, and it was already dangerous before.

489
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:06,150
Rym: Like you have to ride it with a special technique that I learned as a kid, or you will very likely lose a tooth.

490
00:32:07,472 --> 00:32:11,470
Rym: And people did not know this technique, and it was way slicker than it should have been.

491
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:16,670
Rym: And I guess I would say it is like jumping off a roof riding the giant slide.

492
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,819
Rym: Just watch this video.

493
00:32:19,121 --> 00:32:20,350
Rym: This is kind of amazing.

494
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,778
Rym: This brought back so many memories of my childhood.

495
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:25,486
Rym: Do not go to Belle Isle and ride this slide.

496
00:32:25,546 --> 00:32:26,750
Rym: I cannot stress that enough.

497
00:32:27,371 --> 00:32:28,869
Scott: Hopefully they don't let anyone do that.

498
00:32:29,431 --> 00:32:33,310
Rym: They reopened it after degreasing it and spraying it with water.

499
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,349
Scott: But it's still open?

500
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:43,330
Rym: Yeah, but it is back to the level of danger I remember from the late 80s in Detroit, and not the level of danger from like a week ago.

501
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,089
Scott: The danger is too damn high.

502
00:32:45,832 --> 00:32:48,319
Rym: The lyrics to this song are something else.

503
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,101
Rym: What was it?

504
00:32:49,402 --> 00:32:52,310
Rym: If your kids are annoying you, put them on the giant slide.

505
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:53,431
Scott: That's right.

506
00:32:54,114 --> 00:32:58,970
Scott: Alright, so when I was a kid, we did safe things like go to the fancy mall.

507
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:04,130
Rym: Hopefully someone doesn't pop a balloon and cause a stampede.

508
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:11,129
Scott: Yeah, and in the 90s, the economy was fucked the fuck up in a different way than it is now.

509
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:16,270
Scott: And that meant that shopping malls were like amusement parks basically.

510
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,518
Rym: Well, the nice shopping malls were.

511
00:33:18,578 --> 00:33:21,270
Rym: When we were a kid, we would go to Eastside Mall like in Detroit.

512
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,270
Rym: No store like this was in that mall.

513
00:33:24,631 --> 00:33:32,950
Scott: There were regular malls and then there were fancy malls that had, like I said, carousels and you know, all kinds of, you know, it's like go to amusement park.

514
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:38,010
Rym: We would like get in the car as a family on a Saturday and go to Lakeside Mall out in the suburbs.

515
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:41,010
Scott: There would be an arcade there, there would be a food court.

516
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:44,450
Rym: Lakeside Mall had two indoor water slides and a pool.

517
00:33:45,351 --> 00:33:45,572
Scott: Yep.

518
00:33:46,214 --> 00:33:48,323
Scott: It was, you know, get Nathan's, right?

519
00:33:48,343 --> 00:33:49,950
Scott: It was like an event to go to the, anyway.

520
00:33:50,831 --> 00:33:58,950
Scott: So, one of the things, one of the key features of any 90s US fancy mall was a Warner Brothers Studio store.

521
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:09,350
Scott: And the thing about a Warner Brothers Studio store is that, you know, it had, the store itself was just fun to be in because there was all sorts of animatronics and things on display.

522
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,850
Rym: I would say it was Warner Brothers stuff.

523
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:18,489
Rym: The average Warner Brothers store like this was higher quality than the Disney equivalent stores that were contemporary to them.

524
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:25,610
Scott: The Disney stores were pretty equally fancy in terms of the arrangement of the store.

525
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,750
Rym: True, but the Warner Brothers store had way higher quality merchandise.

526
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:35,909
Scott: The Warner Brothers Disney store mostly just sold Disney merch, like shit with Mickey's face on it, right?

527
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:43,050
Scott: It wasn't like you went to the Disney store, it's like there wasn't anything special on sale there typically, right?

528
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:47,268
Scott: It's like I think my cousin collected this one kind of statue they had there, but it's like that was about it.

529
00:34:47,793 --> 00:34:50,350
Rym: Oh my god, the statues I had, anyway.

530
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:58,630
Scott: The Warner Brothers Studio store had like rare, unique merch, like collectibles and shit.

531
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:08,363
Scott: Like at all these stores they were selling animation cells and like, you know, film pieces and like, like if you were a film nerd, they actually had.

532
00:35:08,403 --> 00:35:18,669
Scott: like all these rare, or like, you know, in a day when there wasn't so much internet or no internet, it's like this kind of stuff was not accessible to the average person anywhere, you know?

533
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,849
Scott: Videotapes of things that you couldn't get anywhere else.

534
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,816
Rym: If they still had t-shirts with Batman on them, right?

535
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,840
Rym: Think about how you felt when you went to an anime con before.

536
00:35:29,901 --> 00:35:32,190
Rym: you could buy stuff online and there was a dealer's room.

537
00:35:32,611 --> 00:35:35,907
Rym: That was what it felt like to go to one of these stores in a mall in the 80s and early 90s.

538
00:35:36,971 --> 00:35:52,010
Scott: Yeah, it's like they just had like this unbelievable stuff there, like you couldn't believe that like, it's the kind of stuff you might expect to see at like an amusement park gift shop right in the fancy section, but it's like they were able to gather so much stuff and produce so much stuff and have it in malls everywhere.

539
00:35:52,611 --> 00:35:54,289
Scott: It was like, that was, it was pretty awesome.

540
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:59,770
Scott: Even though we really didn't buy any of it, it was still really great to go to the store, maybe that's why it went out of business.

541
00:36:01,591 --> 00:36:05,030
Scott: Because people going in a store and not buying anything isn't a great way to profit.

542
00:36:05,612 --> 00:36:10,090
Scott: Anyway, so someone made a video about the rise and fall of the Warner Brothers store.

543
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:13,477
Scott: Honestly, the video is not the best video.

544
00:36:13,497 --> 00:36:18,970
Scott: It's not like defunct land where they super researched and give you all this interesting info and you know, whatever.

545
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:26,350
Scott: But, the video does comprise of, is comprised of, a lot of old footage.

546
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:34,830
Scott: So you can see shit going down at Warner Brothers stores back in the day and that is worth watching this video.

547
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:43,590
Scott: You can see like, you know, grand openings of big stores and the interiors of normal ones and interviews with customers and some of the merch and all this stuff.

548
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:48,489
Scott: And if you didn't experience these stores yourself, it's a thing to see.

549
00:36:49,351 --> 00:36:53,065
Scott: And if you have experienced the stores yourself, it's a nostalgia to see.

550
00:36:53,386 --> 00:36:54,490
Scott: So, why not?

551
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:58,619
Rym: In the meta moment, the GeekNights Book Club book is binti.

552
00:36:58,659 --> 00:37:02,410
Rym: We'll see when we do the show because we're going to miss a ton of GeekNights.

553
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:11,630
Rym: I think I'm even going to pause the Patreon for September because I'm going to be with Emily, doing a panel at PAX West, losing on Sunday.

554
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:16,809
Rym: I will also be doing a bunch of work travel and- No, that's this Sunday.

555
00:37:17,472 --> 00:37:20,130
Scott: Yeah, well, it is- No, it's two Sundays from now.

556
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,087
Rym: It is next Sunday, not this Sunday.

557
00:37:22,611 --> 00:37:27,430
Rym: I am very happy that you have agreed with me on this versus next Sunday.

558
00:37:30,672 --> 00:37:33,706
Rym: Otherwise, you know, work travel, that bike trip- I said two Sundays from now.

559
00:37:34,694 --> 00:37:35,687
Rym: Two Sundays from now.

560
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:39,935
Rym: But website's coming along.

561
00:37:39,956 --> 00:37:44,110
Rym: I don't really think we have any other big updates to share just yet.

562
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,170
Rym: Maybe Scott can finish some of the website stuff while we're not doing GeekNights while I'm doing all this travel.

563
00:37:48,753 --> 00:37:49,717
Scott: It depends on the weather.

564
00:37:49,798 --> 00:37:51,969
Scott: This weekend is looking a lot more letter B.

565
00:37:54,254 --> 00:37:57,761
Rym: Bike and beach than it is looking- Yeah, no, this weekend is 100% a B weekend.

566
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:00,933
Scott: Yeah.

567
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:03,590
Scott: Anyway, let's go.

568
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:13,730
Scott: So, yeah, what happened was is last week we went to go and see a Radio City Music Hall where I haven't been inside since last millennia.

569
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:18,030
Scott: Just because there never was a show that I went to see there, just coincidentally.

570
00:38:19,811 --> 00:38:35,810
Scott: And we went to see Joe Hisaishi and a large orchestra with choirs and opera singer and his daughter singing and pianists and a guy playing an instrument I don't know the name of that looked like a ukulele and a banjo got together and had a baby.

571
00:38:37,992 --> 00:38:48,568
Scott: And they played the works of Hayao Miyazaki while on a giant screen they played clips from movies to accompany the music and the whole place was 100% sold out.

572
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:53,479
Scott: And it was actually way- I thought it was going to be pretty good.

573
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:55,605
Scott: It was I'd say better than I thought.

574
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:57,130
Scott: It was pretty fantastic.

575
00:38:57,691 --> 00:39:00,990
Scott: If you have a chance to ever go to that, I recommend it.

576
00:39:02,831 --> 00:39:07,960
Scott: But yeah, he had to cancel his London shows because he got COVID and the US shows got delayed.

577
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:13,210
Scott: but somehow we still went and it happened and he was alright and it was real good.

578
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:16,705
Scott: So, but that made me think, hey, we need a Wednesday idea.

579
00:39:16,766 --> 00:39:17,670
Scott: We haven't watched the anime.

580
00:39:18,351 --> 00:39:21,401
Scott: But how many episodes have we really done about Miyazaki, right?

581
00:39:21,421 --> 00:39:24,170
Scott: The legendary anime director, right?

582
00:39:24,451 --> 00:39:29,367
Rym: Maybe the most legendary anime director in ancient times in like 2006 or something.

583
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:31,831
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

584
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:38,948
Scott: I looked it up and even though we talk about him all the goddamn time in the news and other things, we did an episode on Laputa, a whole episode.

585
00:39:39,108 --> 00:39:39,790
Scott: It was the main bit.

586
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:47,670
Scott: There were some opening bits or geek bites about other works that we saw but we didn't both see them at the same time or whatever.

587
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:54,157
Scott: And it's like we really haven't done a whole lot of full episodes about him.

588
00:39:54,177 --> 00:39:55,860
Scott: We're like, well, you know what?

589
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:01,990
Scott: We're not going to like, I don't see us rewatching all of these soon to do full episodes on all of them.

590
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:08,885
Scott: That would be like a year long project for us because it was like, how many just feature films he made that he directed?

591
00:40:08,965 --> 00:40:11,450
Scott: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, twelve.

592
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,489
Scott: Well, the twelfth one is being worked on.

593
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:15,630
Scott: Only two of them were released.

594
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,617
Scott: Twelve Wednesdays?

595
00:40:16,879 --> 00:40:18,390
Scott: That's like half a year of GeekNights.

596
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:21,690
Rym: Only two of them were released while GeekNights was in production.

597
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:23,127
Scott: Yeah.

598
00:40:24,971 --> 00:40:26,720
Rym: I think we had to review The Wind Rises.

599
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,650
Rym: We saw it in the theater and we had a lot to say about it.

600
00:40:29,152 --> 00:40:29,721
Scott: I didn't see it.

601
00:40:29,742 --> 00:40:30,189
Scott: You saw it.

602
00:40:31,654 --> 00:40:33,300
Scott: I saw Princess Kaguya and you didn't.

603
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,330
Scott: You didn't direct but it was still Studio Ghibli.

604
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,198
Rym: You should watch The Wind Rises.

605
00:40:38,258 --> 00:40:40,770
Rym: I could do a review on it right now without even needing to see it again.

606
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,543
Scott: I heard some music from the soundtrack live.

607
00:40:42,563 --> 00:40:43,429
Scott: I performed live.

608
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:48,910
Rym: It's the one where a lot of the background sound is human beings doing foley with their bodies.

609
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:49,810
Scott: Yeah.

610
00:40:50,612 --> 00:40:54,980
Scott: Anyway, so I'm like, hey, let's just, you know, get an easy Wednesday idea.

611
00:40:55,020 --> 00:41:00,310
Scott: Let's go and talk about these movies and Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli briefly as a whole.

612
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:01,477
Scott: Yeah.

613
00:41:01,498 --> 00:41:02,210
Rym: I think we can focus.

614
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,978
Scott: How can you not have an episode on that?

615
00:41:04,098 --> 00:41:06,350
Scott: That seems like a necessary episode to have.

616
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:24,830
Rym: If there is one thing I associate, if you just say the words Miyazaki movie, the things that I think of just off the top of my head immediately are environmental messages and lush backgrounds, lush landscapes, scenes with lots of little shit moving around everywhere.

617
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:34,090
Scott: You love to do that animation, that particular kind of animation that you see, the boar in Manonoke and Panyo, all the water, right?

618
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:41,150
Scott: It's like the motion of like just lots of snakes or like a blob or, you know, even Spirited Away also, right?

619
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,836
Rym: Or people, whenever there is one character, they're animated in a certain way.

620
00:41:44,876 --> 00:41:52,950
Rym: Whenever there's a bunch of characters, like in In La Pita, there's the blob of pirates that just appears over and over again doing pirate stuff together.

621
00:41:53,471 --> 00:41:53,631
Scott: Yeah.

622
00:41:53,651 --> 00:42:05,170
Scott: It's like this certain, I don't know how they did, just like this is his look of, you know, animating a mass in a certain way that he like keeps going back to and reusing that sort of aesthetic over and over.

623
00:42:05,831 --> 00:42:07,849
Scott: And it's just, it's like an eye candy kind of thing.

624
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:16,329
Rym: I think of with few exceptions, a certain amount of childhood whimsy, strong female protagonists who often look very similar to one another.

625
00:42:18,592 --> 00:42:32,150
Scott: You know, that feeling of being in a warm, cozy cottage in the woods alone, but the cottage is full of interesting shit, like, you know, sort of in a maybe like a Roald Dahl kind of way a little bit.

626
00:42:32,892 --> 00:42:34,190
Scott: A little bit of that feeling.

627
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:35,830
Rym: And also just...

628
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,180
Scott: A little bit of Dr.

629
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:37,810
Scott: Seuss feeling.

630
00:42:38,354 --> 00:42:40,027
Rym: I can say there's definitely a little bit of that in there.

631
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:48,786
Rym: An absolutely like mind, not mind bending, but just an absolutely fantastic score that gets stuck in your head.

632
00:42:48,806 --> 00:42:50,690
Rym: You even think about one of these movies.

633
00:42:51,451 --> 00:42:53,690
Scott: Like we just discussed, that's Joe Hisaki's fault.

634
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,429
Scott: Someone chose to hire him, I guess.

635
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:57,064
Rym: Right.

636
00:42:59,756 --> 00:43:01,400
Scott: So, yeah, let's, uh, let's go through.

637
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,010
Scott: So we're gonna talk about the full length animated features that Miyazaki directed, right?

638
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,628
Scott: So Studio Ghibli is his studio.

639
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:10,370
Scott: You got to remember a lot of things made by that studio.

640
00:43:10,972 --> 00:43:13,769
Scott: He did not direct, you know, someone else directed it.

641
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:17,890
Scott: He had a different level of involvement in those things, right?

642
00:43:18,091 --> 00:43:21,370
Scott: Or, and some of them that they produced were shorter, right?

643
00:43:21,751 --> 00:43:25,650
Scott: So, for example, like Pompoco, it was a Studio Ghibli movie.

644
00:43:25,832 --> 00:43:27,330
Scott: He was the executive producer.

645
00:43:27,732 --> 00:43:28,796
Scott: He was not the director.

646
00:43:29,057 --> 00:43:31,506
Scott: He didn't, you know, who knows, did he draw anything for it?

647
00:43:31,607 --> 00:43:32,430
Scott: Maybe, right?

648
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,950
Scott: But it's like, doesn't count, right?

649
00:43:36,371 --> 00:43:37,790
Scott: You know, Arrietty, right?

650
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:41,970
Scott: It's like he was just a co-screenwriter and planner, right?

651
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:46,630
Scott: So it's like, okay, he had some involvement there, but you can't really call that a Miyazaki movie.

652
00:43:47,031 --> 00:43:49,610
Scott: It is clearly a Studio Ghibli movie, right?

653
00:43:50,451 --> 00:43:55,710
Scott: There were other ones where, like, he was the director, but they were short, right?

654
00:43:56,434 --> 00:43:59,270
Scott: They weren't full-length animated features.

655
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:06,550
Scott: So usually, these are like those ones that they show at the Ghibli Museum only, and you can't see them anywhere else easily.

656
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:08,079
Scott: I have seen exactly one of those.

657
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:13,830
Scott: Yeah, On Your Mark, the music video, right, for example.

658
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:16,789
Scott: But yeah, so the movie is in chronological order.

659
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:24,530
Scott: The only one from before we were born was, you know, Castle of Cagliostro, which I think we might have done a full episode on that.

660
00:44:24,691 --> 00:44:25,928
Rym: If we did, that's an easy show.

661
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,881
Scott: I don't think that was Studio Ghibli, though, right?

662
00:44:27,921 --> 00:44:29,290
Scott: That was just a thing he directed.

663
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,348
Rym: He just directed it and he wrote it.

664
00:44:32,531 --> 00:44:41,270
Rym: And what I love is that Lupin has this already, like, this history that we know today as different people do their take on Lupin.

665
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:42,729
Rym: Just like Bon, we've talked about that before.

666
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:51,570
Rym: And this Lupin was a mold breaker in that there aren't really other Lupins quite like the Miyazaki Lupin.

667
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:56,298
Rym: And this is my favorite.

668
00:44:57,081 --> 00:44:59,950
Rym: I don't even count it my favorite Lupin because I consider it separate.

669
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:08,110
Rym: It is one of my favorite Miyazaki movies, but it is so different from a lot of the Lupin canon that I wouldn't say it's my favorite Lupin movie.

670
00:45:08,631 --> 00:45:14,050
Rym: But it's also my favorite Lupin movie if I combined all the Lupin canons together.

671
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:25,844
Scott: Before this, he had worked on a bunch of these other movies where you can sort of see the one we always go to as a Horus Prince of Sun.

672
00:45:30,532 --> 00:45:33,507
Scott: Sort of like the pre-Miyazaki Miyazaki.

673
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:46,530
Scott: You can watch Horus Prince of Sun that he contributed significantly to and you can see a lot of Studio Ghibli Miyazaki stuff in there even though Studio Ghibli didn't exist yet.

674
00:45:48,491 --> 00:45:56,390
Scott: And then in Castle of Cagliostro where he's actually directing, you can see it even more even though this is an existing property.

675
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:57,292
Scott: He didn't write it.

676
00:45:58,456 --> 00:46:03,770
Scott: I think he made the screenplay, but he didn't create Lupin, right?

677
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,131
Rym: Yeah, he just took Lupin.

678
00:46:05,152 --> 00:46:18,250
Rym: He took these characters and somehow was able to seamlessly have all of them fit into a Miyazaki kind of story that's lighthearted and earnest and fun and whimsical but also a little dark.

679
00:46:18,771 --> 00:46:23,037
Rym: And yet be somehow pretty true to those Lupin characters.

680
00:46:23,598 --> 00:46:32,070
Rym: It's kind of amazing considering what those Lupin characters are like in the vast majority of Lupin that came up to the year 1979.

681
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:36,098
Scott: It also helped that he sort of minimized their involvement in the story, right?

682
00:46:36,138 --> 00:46:41,690
Scott: There is not like a shit ton of Jigen in that movie as compared to other Lupin.

683
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:44,950
Rym: But where he appears with your sword and my anti-tank rifle.

684
00:46:47,632 --> 00:46:47,732
Scott: Sure.

685
00:46:47,792 --> 00:46:53,330
Scott: Alright, so then the real Studio Ghibli begins and Naoshika comes out right after we're born.

686
00:46:55,311 --> 00:46:57,755
Scott: And now the real deal has begun, right?

687
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,478
Scott: He made the manga Naoshika.

688
00:46:59,978 --> 00:47:00,800
Scott: That was his manga.

689
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:03,905
Scott: He made it all, you know, at least his name is the only name on it.

690
00:47:03,965 --> 00:47:05,468
Scott: He had assistants clearly, right?

691
00:47:05,488 --> 00:47:06,870
Scott: Like all manga authors do.

692
00:47:07,831 --> 00:47:10,401
Scott: And the manga, if you haven't read it, it's available in English.

693
00:47:10,421 --> 00:47:12,088
Scott: You can buy this big ol' box with it in there.

694
00:47:12,148 --> 00:47:12,650
Scott: I've read it all.

695
00:47:13,411 --> 00:47:15,855
Scott: Yeah, and that manga is a hell of a thing.

696
00:47:17,277 --> 00:47:18,580
Scott: And it tells this huge story.

697
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:25,090
Scott: And much like Akira, where the movie is, you know, clearly related to the original manga.

698
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:31,418
Scott: But, you know, sort of does not tell the whole vast sprawling story that the manga tells.

699
00:47:31,478 --> 00:47:39,690
Scott: It tells a much more condensed, focused, brief story in the same characters, in the same universe with some similarities, right?

700
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:44,680
Scott: But, you know, it's sort of like, we didn't just adapt it straight over, you know?

701
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:49,410
Scott: But yeah, Naoshika is a hell of a thing.

702
00:47:50,050 --> 00:48:00,590
Rym: Yep, it's definitely, even despite only covering such a tiny part of the manga and being pretty constrained in that way, it still tells a very sweeping, epic story.

703
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:03,593
Rym: And it does a pretty good payoff.

704
00:48:03,613 --> 00:48:05,997
Rym: Like, there's a lot going on in that movie that I very much enjoyed.

705
00:48:06,017 --> 00:48:12,889
Rym: I quote it pretty often that "if not now, then when" from the very end of the movie with the weapon.

706
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:17,610
Rym: I guess, no spoilers for people who somehow have not seen every Miyazaki movie.

707
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:18,895
Scott: You probably should.

708
00:48:18,995 --> 00:48:20,990
Scott: Any movie we mention here, you should probably watch.

709
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:25,204
Rym: Yeah, if there's any movie we mention that you have not heard of or seen, just go watch it, like, tonight.

710
00:48:25,224 --> 00:48:26,810
Rym: You will not be disappointed.

711
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:28,730
Scott: They're all on HBO Max.

712
00:48:28,811 --> 00:48:30,188
Scott: Well, we'll see how long that lasts.

713
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:34,118
Scott: If you're in the US, they're legally available on HBO Max.

714
00:48:34,198 --> 00:48:36,744
Scott: And if you're elsewhere in the world, figure it out.

715
00:48:37,045 --> 00:48:39,129
Scott: And no matter where you are in the world, yarrrr.

716
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:50,062
Rym: So, Laputa Castle in the Sky, it might be my favorite Miyazaki movie.

717
00:48:50,262 --> 00:48:55,770
Rym: Partly because I am big into precursor technology and stories around that kind of story.

718
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:56,729
Scott: Well, Naoshika has some of that.

719
00:48:56,971 --> 00:48:57,474
Rym: Oh, it does.

720
00:48:57,535 --> 00:48:58,380
Rym: I'm not saying it doesn't.

721
00:48:58,461 --> 00:48:59,789
Rym: Actually, a few of these have that.

722
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:03,769
Scott: Even Cagliostro has, sort of.

723
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:21,270
Rym: I guess what I liked about Castle in the Sky, specifically, is that it is a movie, a little bit apart from the rest of his movies, where the environmental storytelling tells this extremely sweeping, epic tale of the rise and fall of civilizations.

724
00:49:21,451 --> 00:49:26,750
Rym: Like, the background of this movie tells a bigger story than a lot of movies tell in their foreground.

725
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:40,610
Rym: But the foreground movie, somehow, is just this very narrow story about some people who are just existing in this tiny fraction of the time that the background is telling this story about.

726
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:47,324
Rym: Like, the opening credits tell you this entire rise and fall story of civilizations, and there's no words.

727
00:49:47,425 --> 00:49:49,830
Rym: You just see it in these very simple imagery.

728
00:49:50,492 --> 00:50:02,570
Rym: I think Laputa, more so than any other movie he made, other than Maybe the Wind Rises, trusts the audience to get it, and trusts the audience to understand what it's trying to say without saying any of that out loud.

729
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:03,391
Scott: Yeah.

730
00:50:03,411 --> 00:50:04,734
Scott: I mean, we did the whole episode on it.

731
00:50:04,754 --> 00:50:10,270
Scott: You can listen to that, but I will say that when I think about Laputa, I also think about Zelda games.

732
00:50:10,451 --> 00:50:11,013
Scott: Oh, yeah.

733
00:50:11,114 --> 00:50:14,690
Scott: In a Zelda game, there's not a lot of talking too much, right?

734
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:21,150
Scott: And it's like, you know, Link walks around a dungeon, and there's an environmental storytelling to it, right?

735
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:24,179
Scott: It's like just experiencing this place, right?

736
00:50:24,419 --> 00:50:28,150
Scott: You now understand, like, what happened here, right?

737
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:29,654
Scott: And Laputa is the same thing.

738
00:50:29,794 --> 00:50:36,310
Scott: All the dialogue in Laputa is about, you know, the people and their, like, current conflict that they're dealing with.

739
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:38,796
Scott: Pretty much most of the dialogue anyway, right?

740
00:50:39,137 --> 00:50:55,490
Scott: But it ends up, you know, they're traveling in the world that they're in, usually in airplanes and other things, and they end up in places that are, you know, amazing, and it's like when you just see the places, you now understand what happened, right?

741
00:50:56,010 --> 00:51:05,090
Scott: And that's, you know, you get this really sort of, you know, sense of awe of, like, as if you were yourself standing in some sort of amazing place like that.

742
00:51:05,471 --> 00:51:14,510
Rym: That is one thing that most Miyazaki movies do very well, is there will be scenes that inspire a sense of awe, very specifically in a particular way.

743
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:22,510
Scott: Yeah, even though Laputa carries over a lot of the, you know, the tropes that Naoshika started that you see in all the Ghibli movies, right?

744
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:27,150
Scott: Like the magical girl heroine character, and all these things we already discussed, right?

745
00:51:27,731 --> 00:51:37,270
Scott: You know, it's one of the only ones that has that sort of, like, you know, going to the secret place deal, right?

746
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:38,162
Rym: Yep.

747
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:40,392
Scott: Anyway, all right.

748
00:51:41,033 --> 00:51:43,820
Scott: Totoro is next one, right?

749
00:51:44,342 --> 00:51:46,146
Scott: That's probably the most famous one.

750
00:51:46,226 --> 00:51:47,590
Scott: It's the one that they use for their logo.

751
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:53,310
Rym: Totoro and Kiki's are the ones I've seen the least recently again.

752
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:59,030
Scott: Totoro is maybe the one I've seen most least recently, but I've seen Kiki's somewhat recently.

753
00:52:00,871 --> 00:52:07,400
Scott: But yeah, Totoro is like, it's just, you know, the story it tells isn't honestly that much of a story.

754
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:13,221
Rym: Well, because the story it's really telling is that, like, why is this family here?

755
00:52:13,341 --> 00:52:17,330
Rym: Like, the story it doesn't tell is sort of the context for the story of Totoro.

756
00:52:19,233 --> 00:52:21,790
Scott: You know, it's sort of an imaginary friend kind of deal.

757
00:52:22,452 --> 00:52:28,850
Rym: How do kids cope with, like, what the adults are talking about and what's actually happening and why we've gone to live in the summer house?

758
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:33,677
Scott: Right, and I think you do see, there's again a commonality with Zelda, right?

759
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:40,490
Scott: Miyamoto always talks about how he made Zelda 1 by, you know, going into the woods and whatever behind his house, right?

760
00:52:41,031 --> 00:52:44,075
Scott: And that sort of feeling, and this is basically that feeling, right?

761
00:52:44,135 --> 00:52:53,650
Scott: It's like, you know, the kid goes outside into the woods behind their house and has, you know, their imagination and their adventures even though it's just a small woods behind a house.

762
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:58,330
Scott: Which actually, that's a theme that brings out the cat boss and it brings out everything.

763
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:02,137
Rym: You want to talk about a very specific theme that is common to almost all Miyazaki movies.

764
00:53:02,497 --> 00:53:09,310
Rym: There will be a child who has real agency over their own world and the world around them.

765
00:53:11,211 --> 00:53:11,592
Scott: Usually.

766
00:53:11,612 --> 00:53:12,756
Rym: Almost all of them.

767
00:53:12,796 --> 00:53:15,063
Rym: The ones that don't, like, The Wind Rises does not have that.

768
00:53:15,163 --> 00:53:17,270
Rym: The Wind Rises is a very different movie.

769
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:18,390
Scott: Parkaroso, not so much.

770
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:20,870
Rym: Parkaroso is very much like The Wind Rises.

771
00:53:22,151 --> 00:53:23,490
Scott: The airplane ones, right?

772
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:26,230
Rym: Yeah, the airplane ones are about a very different thing.

773
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:27,494
Scott: Well, Lapita is also an airplane one.

774
00:53:27,534 --> 00:53:28,819
Scott: Nachika is also an airplane one.

775
00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:29,722
Scott: That's another thing.

776
00:53:30,143 --> 00:53:32,030
Scott: Miyazaki fucking loves airplanes, right?

777
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:37,990
Rym: I would argue that Lapita, I refuse to explain this in detail because we don't have that much time left on the show.

778
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:47,230
Rym: Lapita is the intersection of the rest of what Miyazaki likes to do and specifically the themes of The Wind Rises and Parkaroso.

779
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:49,723
Rym: But I refuse to explain that further.

780
00:53:50,005 --> 00:53:50,750
Rym: I will not elaborate.

781
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:53,516
Rym: But Pokemon does that too.

782
00:53:53,717 --> 00:53:56,950
Rym: And you see this very specifically in Kiki's Delivery Service.

783
00:53:59,172 --> 00:54:05,510
Scott: You've got a young girl in Kiki's Delivery Service who comes to a town and creates a business and starts paying rent.

784
00:54:06,032 --> 00:54:09,390
Scott: And it's like becoming an instant adult basically.

785
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:14,890
Rym: Kiki's is just such a delightful, charming movie that everyone should watch.

786
00:54:16,271 --> 00:54:28,910
Scott: The story of it is not a particularly amazing story, but it's just that you don't see that kind of story become a mass media item.

787
00:54:29,531 --> 00:54:31,458
Scott: No one sells a book with that kind of story.

788
00:54:31,478 --> 00:54:33,244
Scott: No one sells a movie with that kind of story.

789
00:54:33,345 --> 00:54:34,629
Scott: Except this one, right?

790
00:54:37,972 --> 00:54:42,062
Rym: So when we get past that, these movies all are very similar to one another in a lot of ways.

791
00:54:42,082 --> 00:54:45,430
Rym: They have these very clear thematic connections.

792
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:52,590
Rym: And then Parkaroso I think hits a lot of people who are watching a Miyazaki canon like a curveball.

793
00:54:53,070 --> 00:55:02,170
Rym: Because it is about fascism, it is about chauvinism, it is an adult movie, but it's animated the same way as all the rest of them.

794
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:05,682
Rym: It's got the blobs of people and that amazing fist fight scene.

795
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:08,190
Rym: It's got all the Miyazaki scenes.

796
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:15,465
Rym: That fist fight scene is like, that goes on a top ten list of animated scenes in all movies ever for me.

797
00:55:17,009 --> 00:55:17,630
Rym: Maybe top twenty.

798
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:26,210
Scott: It's definitely more, most of Miyazaki movies, all of them, are clearly movies for children first.

799
00:55:27,171 --> 00:55:29,156
Scott: Like George Lucas likes to pretend.

800
00:55:29,236 --> 00:55:31,743
Scott: He's like Star Wars is for the children.

801
00:55:31,763 --> 00:55:34,370
Scott: Miyazaki's movies are for the children.

802
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:41,710
Scott: Except, Parkaroso, even if he wants to say it was for the children, I don't think a lot of children would enjoy or understand it.

803
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:43,893
Scott: I can't imagine how they would.

804
00:55:44,253 --> 00:55:54,030
Scott: I don't think I would have enjoyed, I might have slightly enjoyed it, but not understood it when I was a child until maybe at least I had two digits or plus in my age.

805
00:55:54,591 --> 00:56:02,665
Rym: I expect as a child I would have loved Parkaroso and not realized what it was about and be like, "Yeah, the cool pig.

806
00:56:03,166 --> 00:56:04,168
Rym: He's got an airplane.

807
00:56:04,268 --> 00:56:04,709
Rym: Yeah!".

808
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:18,810
Rym: But, Parkaroso, much like The Wind Rises, is very much like this deep interrogation of what it is to be a man or what are the consequences of the decisions we make.

809
00:56:20,391 --> 00:56:30,230
Rym: It'd be hard to get into it much deeper without getting into Parkaroso, which I feel like we can do a show on at some point, but Parkaroso is a standout movie for me specifically.

810
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:45,970
Rym: It's got this sort of mid-century, it reminds me of a lot of plays and musicals that are sort of set in this Americana mid-century, just in terms of the style of the way people interact and how the towns on these islands act.

811
00:56:46,251 --> 00:56:51,589
Rym: Even though it's not set in that setting, it has a similar aesthetic or a similar sort of feel to me.

812
00:56:55,152 --> 00:57:03,730
Scott: Those first four, Naoshika, Laputa, Totoro, Kiki's, those are huge deals, but they were huge deals on the other side of the world.

813
00:57:04,491 --> 00:57:10,266
Scott: People still didn't know about any of that stuff outside of that geography in and around Japan.

814
00:57:12,151 --> 00:57:26,270
Scott: Princess Mononoke was sort of the breaking point, where I remember in the year 2000, in between high school and college, I went to Israel and one of the kids I was on the trip with was talking about this movie, Princess Mononoke.

815
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:29,798
Scott: I didn't know who Miyazaki was, I didn't know anything.

816
00:57:31,142 --> 00:57:32,946
Scott: But he's like, "Oh, you gotta see this movie, it's the

817
00:57:32,966 --> 00:57:33,267
Scott: best.".

818
00:57:33,347 --> 00:57:33,688
Scott: And I'm like,

819
00:57:33,768 --> 00:57:34,089
Scott: "Alright.".

820
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:41,003
Scott: And then I remember we walked past a movie theater and the poster for the movie was there.

821
00:57:41,123 --> 00:57:44,069
Scott: and I'm like, "Oh, this dude was talking about a movie that's out

822
00:57:44,149 --> 00:57:44,390
Scott: now.".

823
00:57:44,892 --> 00:57:48,270
Scott: I didn't realize that, I thought it was some older movie I had missed or something.

824
00:57:49,151 --> 00:57:55,621
Rym: I had pirated Mononoke Hime with subtitles to watch before it even made it to the US.

825
00:57:55,941 --> 00:58:01,370
Rym: I already had the soundtrack that I pirated, because by then I was already like eight years into being a weeb.

826
00:58:02,611 --> 00:58:11,069
Rym: But it was the first anime movie in my entire life where non-weebs knew about it without me being the one to tell them about it.

827
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:13,890
Scott: Right, well Akira I think was the first one of those.

828
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:17,409
Rym: Non-weebs in my area did not know about Akira, weirdly.

829
00:58:19,092 --> 00:58:21,410
Scott: It was in a local newspaper and shit.

830
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:29,250
Rym: All the people I knew who were into weird sci-fi stuff when I was a kid, they were also already into anime, mostly because I got them into anime.

831
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:35,762
Scott: Anyway, so it was in the theaters around the world to some extent where the other ones weren't.

832
00:58:36,303 --> 00:58:39,390
Scott: It got the big time Hollywood dub in the US.

833
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:47,609
Scott: Disney got the famous people to dub it, which was a big deal that hadn't been done, I don't think it had been done before at all for any anime that I'm aware of.

834
00:58:48,613 --> 00:58:50,269
Rym: For its minor fault, pretty fantastic.

835
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:54,570
Scott: Not that no anime had been dubbed before, but none had been famous Hollywood big time dubs.

836
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:58,510
Rym: Kiki's actually had a pretty for real dub, but not on the level of Mononoke Hime.

837
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:00,142
Scott: Wasn't that dub made after?

838
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,049
Scott: I'm not sure, I don't know.

839
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:04,830
Rym: Yeah, I forget what year that dub was made, I'm not gonna dig through all the Wikipedia's right now.

840
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:06,134
Scott: Yeah, I don't know when they did that.

841
00:59:06,797 --> 00:59:10,530
Scott: Regardless, was Kiki in the theaters in the US?

842
00:59:11,191 --> 00:59:15,678
Rym: But that was Mononoke and then Spirited Away, like one after another a few years apart.

843
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:23,650
Rym: Those were mainstream movies in America, a lot of people saw them, a lot of people found out who Miyazaki was because of them.

844
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:32,550
Scott: Right, well Mononoke was like, you know, here I am, rest of the world, and it's like, now we know who you are, and then Spirited Away, it's like that guy's back.

845
00:59:32,651 --> 00:59:35,029
Rym: From the person who brought you Princess Mononoke.

846
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:38,777
Scott: Exactly, and that sort of, it was sort of like a combo, right?

847
00:59:39,238 --> 00:59:45,070
Scott: Mononoke was the jab, and Spirited Away was the big hook that knocked out the rest of the world.

848
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:49,610
Rym: I think Spirited Away is the best put together movie.

849
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:53,170
Scott: But certainly the most popular, best selling, most grossing number one of all.

850
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:55,496
Rym: I think it's the best put together movie he's ever made.

851
00:59:56,037 --> 01:00:01,130
Rym: I think it's the most technically well made, it's got the tightest script, the tightest story.

852
01:00:02,052 --> 01:00:04,450
Rym: Spirited Away is nearly, it might just be a perfect movie.

853
01:00:05,471 --> 01:00:08,537
Scott: I think it's clearly the peak Miyazaki, right?

854
01:00:08,577 --> 01:00:14,510
Scott: Not to say that everything, the things that came after Spirited Away were still excellent in their own right.

855
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:19,930
Rym: Well I would argue that Wind Rises is more poignant than Spirited Away, but I think Spirited Away is a better movie.

856
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:33,910
Scott: Right, but if you just take in all, if you consider all factors, I feel like Spirited Away was the peak of the Miyazaki mountain, and since then, I'm not saying it's been downhill into the dumps, right?

857
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:37,464
Scott: But it has not been as high as it was at that point, right?

858
01:00:37,685 --> 01:00:38,869
Scott: It is lower than it was then.

859
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:48,230
Rym: Because after that, four years later, we get Ponyo, which was beautiful, and I loved it, but it does not tell much of a story compared to pretty much any Miyazaki movie.

860
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:54,329
Scott: It's kind of a mess a little bit, it's the cohesion of what's going on here, why, why do we care, right?

861
01:00:55,030 --> 01:01:00,386
Scott: You know, it has a little bit of that Totoro thing going on where it's like, okay, the kid is Ponyo, right?

862
01:01:00,466 --> 01:01:01,409
Scott: Or the kid has the imagination.

863
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:07,110
Rym: I appreciate that it doesn't explain anything and just lets, like, you're just supposed to just roll with it.

864
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,735
Scott: It explains a little bit, right?

865
01:01:08,755 --> 01:01:13,650
Scott: There's that weird underwater mad science hatter kind of guy going on, you know.

866
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:18,124
Scott: I'm sure someone out there is mad, like, they know the plot of Ponyo completely.

867
01:01:18,204 --> 01:01:19,610
Scott: I saw it once in the theater and that's it.

868
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:20,451
Rym: I mean, I'd say I know.

869
01:01:21,132 --> 01:01:31,150
Rym: The movie does the thing that Lapita does where it just shows you some stuff that's in the background, that's the world, and it trusts that you're just gonna understand it enough to engage with the movie.

870
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:35,116
Rym: What's really familiar is, in Lapita, that was done extremely well.

871
01:01:35,176 --> 01:01:43,190
Rym: In Ponyo, I thought it was done well enough, but a lot of people who saw the movie just did not pick up on those things and were just confused.

872
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:46,349
Rym: Which is sad, but that's just how movie-watching audiences are.

873
01:01:47,092 --> 01:01:48,570
Scott: Oh, we skipped over Howl's moving cast.

874
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:49,352
Rym: Oh, yeah.

875
01:01:49,412 --> 01:01:53,925
Rym: Well, Howl's was all fun, but there was, like, no substance there.

876
01:01:53,945 --> 01:01:55,850
Rym: It didn't really line up with the book.

877
01:01:56,971 --> 01:02:00,544
Scott: For some reason, like, there's a lot of people I know, like, that's their favorite one.

878
01:02:00,585 --> 01:02:01,950
Scott: Like, they love the shit out of it.

879
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:05,604
Rym: If you didn't read the books this is based on, what the hell?

880
01:02:05,704 --> 01:02:07,030
Rym: What story did it tell?

881
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:21,310
Scott: Well, it's like, yeah, there's not a lot of context for, like, what's going on, you know, and it's like, I just couldn't, like, bring myself to care about what was happening in Howl's Moving Castle.

882
01:02:21,611 --> 01:02:32,810
Scott: Even though the environment and the characters and everything about it were, you know, basically amazing, I couldn't care because I didn't understand without the context.

883
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:39,330
Rym: Much like Howl himself, both in the movie and the books, Howl's Moving Castle, the Miyazaki movie, is just a hot mess.

884
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:42,238
Scott: I wouldn't say a hot mess.

885
01:02:42,298 --> 01:02:44,209
Scott: I've seen much bigger messes, but...

886
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:45,790
Rym: Well, as in, it is beautiful.

887
01:02:46,495 --> 01:02:47,147
Scott: It's clearly not as...

888
01:02:48,451 --> 01:02:54,250
Rym: It is beautiful, it is fun, it is worth watching, but it's just a goddamn mess of a movie.

889
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:57,390
Scott: Also, Cowsl for the Talking Fire is, like, my favorite game.

890
01:02:57,510 --> 01:03:03,870
Rym: Yeah, like, I would watch Howl's Moving Castle again, but it doesn't really fully explore any of the themes it raises.

891
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:08,047
Rym: Like, it raises a lot of interesting ideas and then just drops them.

892
01:03:09,711 --> 01:03:12,157
Rym: And it kind of just peters out toward the end.

893
01:03:12,197 --> 01:03:14,142
Rym: Like, the movie just gets less and less...

894
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:22,390
Scott: It's a kind of magnifiable, like, you know, flow with a big climax and a, you know, resolution.

895
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:28,703
Rym: And while Ponyo has similar problems, at least Ponyo sort of gets more and more dreamlike.

896
01:03:28,884 --> 01:03:31,710
Rym: and then there's this moment where you feel like you woke up from a dream.

897
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,478
Rym: Howl's doesn't really have a moment like that.

898
01:03:34,498 --> 01:03:37,890
Rym: Howl's just meanders off into nowhere and then the credits roll.

899
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:39,371
Scott: Alright.

900
01:03:39,532 --> 01:03:40,557
Scott: And then there's Wind Rises.

901
01:03:40,617 --> 01:03:46,510
Scott: that was Miyazaki going off on his own... Yeah, the Wind Rises... Airplane fanboyism again.

902
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:49,762
Rym: And I would argue it is Miy- because you know what it's about, right?

903
01:03:49,783 --> 01:03:51,230
Rym: Do you know what this movie is about?

904
01:03:51,971 --> 01:03:52,925
Scott: It's about the dude...

905
01:03:54,150 --> 01:04:02,490
Rym: It is about the dude who basically designed the Zero, like, the fighter that Japanese forces used in World War II.

906
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:12,630
Rym: And the story is basically this guy made these death machines because he loved the beauty of their mechanism and their design.

907
01:04:13,312 --> 01:04:18,530
Rym: And he willfully turned a blind eye to what they were going to be used for.

908
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,457
Rym: That is what this movie is about.

909
01:04:20,518 --> 01:04:22,389
Rym: He was in love with aviation.

910
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:30,250
Rym: The only way to express that was by making war machines that killed countless people in one of the worst conflicts in human history.

911
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:40,690
Rym: And the movie is about the disconnect between the craft and the progress of humanity and the reality of those weapons being used by fascists to murder people.

912
01:04:42,091 --> 01:04:47,730
Rym: And the movie does this in many layers, and I will elaborate in a show at some point.

913
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:50,964
Rym: And he's got a new one coming!

914
01:04:51,266 --> 01:04:51,910
Rym: How do you live?

915
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:55,470
Scott: The one that he's trying, you know, he refuses to retire.

916
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:58,549
Rym: I feel like he's asking this question of himself at this point.

917
01:04:59,191 --> 01:05:01,069
Scott: Well that's the title of the book it's based on.

918
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:06,587
Scott: So the author, Genzaburo is the author, right?

919
01:05:09,292 --> 01:05:10,349
Rym: Yeah, Yoshino Genzaburo.

920
01:05:11,819 --> 01:05:12,065
Scott: Right.

921
01:05:12,107 --> 01:05:12,230
Scott: Right?

922
01:05:13,691 --> 01:05:15,717
Scott: But yeah, the book is called How Do You Live?

923
01:05:15,797 --> 01:05:19,950
Scott: It's like a famous book that I haven't read.

924
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:26,170
Scott: But the book is, I think we did a news or a thing of the day or something, when the book became available in English.

925
01:05:26,651 --> 01:05:29,101
Scott: And I put it on my list to read it at some point.

926
01:05:29,563 --> 01:05:30,808
Scott: Maybe it could be a book club book.

927
01:05:30,828 --> 01:05:31,250
Scott: Who knows?

928
01:05:31,730 --> 01:05:33,426
Scott: Maybe when the movie comes out we'll read it.

929
01:05:33,567 --> 01:05:33,910
Scott: I don't know.

930
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:35,230
Rym: I think this is very important.

931
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:36,449
Scott: Will the movie come out?

932
01:05:37,613 --> 01:05:47,492
Rym: It's the movie about the coming of age of a teenager, but more importantly it was published in 1937.

933
01:05:47,492 --> 01:06:01,110
Rym: And knowing that, and knowing what Miyazaki's previous movie was about, it is easy to see that he's exploring these themes of fascism and its intersection with art and its intersection with life.

934
01:06:01,671 --> 01:06:09,810
Rym: And we'll see what this movie is, but I feel like this is going to be a lot more like The Wind Rises and a lot less like Kiki's Delivery Service.

935
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:11,996
Scott: Yeah, well we'll see if it comes out.

936
01:06:12,197 --> 01:06:15,650
Scott: And if it does come out and he's still alive, is he going to keep going?

937
01:06:15,931 --> 01:06:17,869
Scott: You know, it's like you feel like he's, you know.

938
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:18,270
Scott: Right?

939
01:06:19,591 --> 01:06:20,012
Scott: I don't know.

940
01:06:21,758 --> 01:06:25,430
Scott: I have the book about Miyazaki, the starting point book that I haven't read at all.

941
01:06:26,952 --> 01:06:31,390
Scott: And it's like, it's like he's a cranky old man who smokes a lot.

942
01:06:34,034 --> 01:06:36,948
Scott: You know, it's like wow, but he's still at it somehow.

943
01:06:37,149 --> 01:06:37,410
Scott: Alright.

944
01:06:37,851 --> 01:06:38,679
Scott: And he works too much.

945
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:39,810
Scott: All he does is draw.

946
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:51,730
Rym: Well I guess the important takeaway is that regardless of which of his movies you like or don't like or your opinions on any of them in particular, Miyazaki and his works are absolutely unignorable.

947
01:06:52,393 --> 01:06:56,030
Rym: They are deeply important to the history of animation and the history of cinema.

948
01:06:56,692 --> 01:06:59,070
Rym: And I think every one of them is worth watching.

949
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:00,270
Rym: Without exception.

950
01:07:01,312 --> 01:07:03,097
Scott: Who else, right?

951
01:07:03,939 --> 01:07:07,630
Scott: We've seen like, you could say Disney as a whole, but it's like, alright.

952
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:13,790
Rym: There are some Disney animated features that are not actually required viewing in the year 2022.

953
01:07:13,790 --> 01:07:14,612
Scott: Oh, there's plenty.

954
01:07:14,672 --> 01:07:17,820
Scott: What I'm saying is like, what individual animation...

955
01:07:21,791 --> 01:07:22,536
Rym: ...animated feature?

956
01:07:22,556 --> 01:07:24,690
Rym: Yeah, there's some sinkers in there.

957
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:36,450
Scott: If you have taken any person in throughout his history, right, who has directed animated movies, right, and you compare their entire bodies of work up against each other, right?

958
01:07:36,830 --> 01:07:39,850
Scott: It's like Miyazaki's just gonna win by a lot, right?

959
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:40,669
Scott: It's just an avalanche.

960
01:07:41,631 --> 01:07:43,250
Scott: Like who's even in second place?

961
01:07:43,590 --> 01:07:44,375
Rym: Like Tezuka.

962
01:07:44,536 --> 01:07:46,909
Rym: You're already talking about Tezuka in terms of volume of output.

963
01:07:47,752 --> 01:07:51,340
Scott: What movies, what animated movies did Tezuka direct?

964
01:07:51,541 --> 01:07:53,004
Scott: And how many of them?

965
01:07:53,044 --> 01:07:54,869
Scott: He drew a lot of manga, right?

966
01:07:54,909 --> 01:07:55,390
Scott: Tons of it.

967
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:59,141
Scott: But it's like, you know, that's quantity, right?

968
01:07:59,221 --> 01:08:02,110
Scott: Not all of them are quality, even though many are the highest quality.

969
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:05,541
Scott: It's like, just look at directed animated movies.

970
01:08:05,903 --> 01:08:07,549
Scott: It's like there's no one even close.

971
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:20,450
Rym: Miyazaki's like, it's almost like a Babe Ruth situation, but imagine if there was a Babe Ruth type baseball player who, every three or four years, just suddenly is on the bench on the team, out of nowhere.

972
01:08:20,609 --> 01:08:21,792
Rym: You're like, "Oh, I guess he's

973
01:08:21,832 --> 01:08:22,073
Rym: back."

974
01:08:22,314 --> 01:08:27,609
Rym: And he comes out, and his at-bat is a spectacle, and then he disappears for a few years.

975
01:08:28,189 --> 01:08:33,750
Scott: I think it's like Wayne Gretzky, like he's got numbers that no one else is gonna, no one's breaking, they're just not, it's not happening.

976
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:37,095
Scott: It's like no one's gonna break the records that they have.

977
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:38,599
Scott: He's too strong.

978
01:08:39,962 --> 01:08:43,390
Scott: But I think he'll be a legendary artist, right?

979
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:46,173
Scott: I think if you wait like a century or so, right?

980
01:08:46,233 --> 01:08:58,609
Scott: It's like, I think it's pretty clear that Miyazaki's gonna be like a Van Gogh level of famous, you know, Michelangelo level of, you know, art history, like he'll be in the art history book, right?

981
01:08:58,669 --> 01:08:59,710
Scott: Next to all those people.

982
01:09:04,482 --> 01:09:06,728
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

983
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:11,760
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

984
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:17,140
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

985
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:20,087
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

986
01:09:20,227 --> 01:09:24,840
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

987
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:29,188
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

988
01:09:29,609 --> 01:09:32,714
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

989
01:09:32,895 --> 01:09:35,779
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

990
01:09:36,321 --> 01:09:51,200
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Alan Joyce, Linki G, Dread Lily, Tenebrae, a bunch of people who really don't want me to say their names, Kristen Dodd, Chris Farmer, Clinton, Walden, Dex, Finn, Kishaya85, Rebecca Dunn, ReviewMedable34, Coward, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Horo.

991
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:52,643
Rym: Stop all the downloading.

992
01:09:52,923 --> 01:09:59,020
Rym: The next station is Downsview Park, Downsview Park Station, and a bunch of people whose names I'm not gonna say.

993
01:09:59,401 --> 01:10:06,620
Rym: Like I said, I am probably going to pause the Patreon during September, just because we'll be skipping so many shows due to all that travel.

994
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:11,520
Rym: So that'll save those of you whose names I have said at least five bucks.

995
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:14,606
Rym: And yeah, just enjoying summer.

996
01:10:14,807 --> 01:10:19,740
Rym: Stay safe out there, and I will simply leave you right now with something you should have expected.

997
01:10:29,361 --> 01:10:30,504
Media: Hey, you can break your back.

998
01:10:30,524 --> 01:10:31,507
Media: On the giant slide.

999
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:32,831
Media: You can even break your neck.

1000
01:10:32,891 --> 01:10:33,954
Media: On the giant slide.

1001
01:10:34,014 --> 01:10:35,277
Media: You can even bump your head.

1002
01:10:35,298 --> 01:10:36,120
Media: On the giant slide.

1003
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:37,563
Rym: Man, watch your hands and your legs.

1004
01:10:37,644 --> 01:10:38,606
Media: On the giant slide.

1005
01:10:38,647 --> 01:10:39,930
Media: It's like jumping off a roof.

1006
01:10:40,031 --> 01:10:41,094
Media: On the giant slide.

1007
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:42,317
Media: Man, you can lose a tooth.

1008
01:10:42,417 --> 01:10:43,280
Media: On the giant slide.

1009
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,704
Media: It ain't much you can do.

1010
01:10:44,784 --> 01:10:45,707
Media: On the giant slide.

1011
01:10:45,727 --> 01:10:47,813
Media: What's going on with this new fucking giant slide?

1012
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:49,980
Media: Kids were getting on my nerves, so I sent them to the giant slide.

1013
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:52,206
Media: I told them, "Hold on, baby, it's about to be a giant

1014
01:10:52,226 --> 01:10:52,346
Media: slide.".

1015
01:10:52,387 --> 01:10:54,874
Media: So when you go down, baby, it's about to be a lot of fun.

1016
01:10:54,894 --> 01:10:55,917
Media: Man, I don't know what happened.

1017
01:10:55,977 --> 01:10:57,120
Media: All I heard was a lot of crying.

1018
01:10:57,140 --> 01:10:59,366
Media: They sent the same giant slide we got on as children.

1019
01:10:59,386 --> 01:11:01,773
Media: This new slide looking like they jumping off of a building.

1020
01:11:01,793 --> 01:11:04,260
Media: This new slide, you got to take a Tylenol to get on.

1021
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:06,526
Media: If your kids getting on your nerves, make them get on.

1022
01:11:06,546 --> 01:11:09,154
Media: They're still getting on your nerves, so you make them get back on.

1023
01:11:09,174 --> 01:11:11,300
Media: This new giant slide break necks and back bones.

1024
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:13,784
Media: Then you just lay the kids down soon as you get back on.

1025
01:11:13,804 --> 01:11:16,390
Media: Let my kids get on once, and they ain't want to get back on.

1026
01:11:16,410 --> 01:11:17,973
Media: Hey, you can break your back.

1027
01:11:17,993 --> 01:11:18,995
Media: On the giant slide.

1028
01:11:19,135 --> 01:11:20,338
Media: You can even break your neck.

1029
01:11:20,418 --> 01:11:21,360
Media: On the giant slide.

1030
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:22,782
