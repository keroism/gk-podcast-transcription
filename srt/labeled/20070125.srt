1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,070
Scott: It's Thursday, January 25th.

2
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:13,080
Rym: I'm Scott, and I'm Rym, and this is Geek Next.

3
00:00:17,631 --> 00:00:21,946
Scott: Tonight we discuss Odoru Daiso Sase, a.k.a.

4
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,865
Scott: Bayside Shake Dad, a.k.a.

5
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:26,829
Scott: Rhythm and Police.

6
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:33,277
Scott: Let's do this!

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,700
Rym: So I had a bit of an adventure going into work today.

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:45,437
Rym: I talk about my car a lot lately, but my car, now that I spend 10 hours a week in it, has a great influence on my life.

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,620
Scott: Yeah, I just don't have problems with my car ever since I got a new one.

10
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,074
Scott: You know, I used to be like, "Uh, car's old and shitty, huh?

11
00:00:52,195 --> 00:00:52,739
Scott: Car's old and

12
00:00:52,779 --> 00:00:52,980
Scott: shitty.".

13
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,170
Scott: You used to drive- Then for like a week, it was like, "Uh, I got a new

14
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:56,552
Scott: car.".

15
00:00:56,652 --> 00:00:57,758
Scott: Then it's, "It's a

16
00:00:57,798 --> 00:00:58,019
Scott: car.".

17
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,194
Rym: You used to drive the second worst car I had ever sat in.

18
00:01:01,516 --> 00:01:02,642
Scott: The worst car- That was it?

19
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:04,333
Scott: That was the second worst car you ever sat in?

20
00:01:04,354 --> 00:01:05,319
Scott: You're pretty good off.

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,540
Rym: Well, the worst car I ever sat in was the identical car that James owned.

22
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,920
Scott: Yeah, I mean, my car- my old car was bad, but it wasn't that bad.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,670
Scott: I've seen a lot worse cars.

24
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:16,480
Scott: Like, cars with holes in the floor.

25
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,019
Rym: Oh, I've seen them, but I've never been in them.

26
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:19,365
Scott: Ahh.

27
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,261
Rym: Yeah.

28
00:01:20,944 --> 00:01:27,583
Rym: But no, I get up, you know, I'm going to work like you do, and I get in my car, and I start it, and it's like any other day.

29
00:01:27,643 --> 00:01:29,449
Rym: My car drives flawlessly.

30
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:34,712
Rym: It's an old car, but despite the over 100,000 miles on it, it works like a perfect car.

31
00:01:34,753 --> 00:01:35,540
Rym: Nothing's wrong with it.

32
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,044
Scott: It goes.

33
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:37,920
Scott: It doesn't have air conditioning, but it goes.

34
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:45,244
Rym: Yep, and actually, it goes pretty fast, and it's a fairly- considering what I paid for it, and considering it's only 120 horsepower, it performs pretty well.

35
00:01:45,726 --> 00:01:48,800
Rym: I can get up to about 95 before it starts shaking or anything.

36
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:57,720
Rym: But anyway, so I'm driving to work, and I'm just about to get on the Taconic, when suddenly, the battery light comes on.

37
00:01:58,466 --> 00:01:58,719
Rym: Uh-oh.

38
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:14,652
Rym: Now, I'm thinking to myself, you know, and then, while I'm thinking to myself, I flash back to a couple years ago, where I was getting my car inspected for New York State, and I'm looking at it, and while they're doing everything, I tell the guy, "Could you please replace my battery?

39
00:02:14,692 --> 00:02:16,580
Rym: That's the original battery from this car.

40
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,505
Rym: It's never been changed.

41
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:18,450
Rym: It's never been serviced.

42
00:02:18,591 --> 00:02:19,516
Rym: I should probably just get a new

43
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:19,677
Rym: one.".

44
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:25,700
Rym: And he took one look at it, tested it, and said, "Not only is this battery fine, it's like new.

45
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,716
Rym: I'll buy you a new battery and pay for your towing if that battery fails you within the next 100,000

46
00:02:30,716 --> 00:02:30,836
Rym: miles.".

47
00:02:32,762 --> 00:02:33,586
Rym: And I was like, "You know what?

48
00:02:33,627 --> 00:02:34,009
Rym: Whatever.".

49
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,898
Rym: And I kept the same battery in, and now-- Did he get that in writing?

50
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:38,445
Rym: I trust this guy.

51
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:39,349
Rym: I work with him all the time.

52
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,280
Rym: He's been my mechanic for a long, long time.

53
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,620
Rym: So I'm thinking back to this driving now, and my battery light come on, and I'm thinking, "Son of a fuck.

54
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,329
Rym: That was a bad

55
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:49,814
Rym: idea.".

56
00:02:50,560 --> 00:03:04,359
Rym: Because either my battery has done something catastrophic, which is somewhat possible because the battery is weird, or my alternator's died, which is the more likely thing in general-- Or somehow, in a freak accident, the wiring somewhere in there got messed up.

57
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,360
Rym: Which isn't out of the realm.

58
00:03:05,661 --> 00:03:07,560
Scott: It's not out of the realm, but it's not common.

59
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,300
Rym: Yeah, old cars tend to have wiring problems.

60
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,100
Scott: If the battery light goes on, 99% of the time, its alternator or battery is broken.

61
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,220
Rym: Most likely, if it comes on while you're driving, it's alternator.

62
00:03:17,527 --> 00:03:17,680
Scott: Yep.

63
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,560
Rym: So now I have to debate, because I've just gotten on the Taconic.

64
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:28,880
Rym: There's basically no civilization between that part of the Taconic where I just got on and my work.

65
00:03:29,403 --> 00:03:31,575
Rym: So I'm debating, "Can I make it to

66
00:03:31,615 --> 00:03:31,796
Rym: work?".

67
00:03:32,581 --> 00:03:37,880
Rym: Because at my job, in the industrial pla-- Well, it was an industrial plaza, now it's more commercial.

68
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,638
Rym: There's actually a mechanic right there.

69
00:03:40,202 --> 00:03:42,970
Scott: Well, if you turn off your radio and your lights-- No.

70
00:03:44,064 --> 00:03:45,060
Rym: See, it depends.

71
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,620
Rym: I'm thinking-- I mean, I'm going all these calculations.

72
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,040
Rym: Is my alternator dead, or is it just not charging the battery so well?

73
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,560
Rym: Does that light mean the alternator's not charging it, or does it mean the battery is close to being drained?

74
00:03:57,701 --> 00:04:02,230
Scott: Yeah, it's the same problem I have with Macs, is that they give you an error message like, "Printer not

75
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:02,638
Scott: working."

76
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,959
Scott: And I'm like, "Well, why don't you give me some more information so I can actually figure out what the fuck I'm supposed to

77
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:08,119
Scott: do?".

78
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,073
Scott: Instead of just, "Eh, battery

79
00:04:10,113 --> 00:04:10,536
Scott: problem."

80
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,434
Scott: It's like, "Can I have more details,

81
00:04:12,475 --> 00:04:12,677
Scott: please?".

82
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:15,079
Rym: Yeah, my car has basically four lights.

83
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,420
Rym: It has check engine, which means anything that isn't described by the other three.

84
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:19,807
Scott: Yeah.

85
00:04:20,481 --> 00:04:22,939
Rym: It has a battery light, which I'd never seen before.

86
00:04:24,061 --> 00:04:28,700
Rym: It has a fluid light that refers to any and all measurable fluids in the car.

87
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:32,339
Rym: If any fluid is low, including my gas, that light will come on.

88
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:34,000
Scott: Oh, wow, I have a separate gas light.

89
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,959
Rym: And then I have the analog brake and all that.

90
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:40,939
Rym: But, so now I'm thinking, "Ah, shit, what do I do?

91
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:43,474
Rym: I know where a mechanic is, but I have to go

92
00:04:43,494 --> 00:04:43,796
Rym: north.".

93
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:48,460
Rym: And at the last second, I decide, "All right, I'm getting off because I'm at this exit.

94
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,717
Rym: I'm not going to risk it breaking down on this

95
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:51,020
Rym: conic.".

96
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,140
Rym: So I turn around, I go back up north, and I pull into this mechanic.

97
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,860
Rym: Now, while I'm driving back up north, my headlights, my daytime running lights dim a little bit.

98
00:05:00,063 --> 00:05:00,271
Scott: Uh-oh.

99
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,679
Rym: Then my analog brake light comes on, meaning that there is now no longer enough power for analog brakes.

100
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:07,132
Scott: Uh-oh.

101
00:05:07,805 --> 00:05:09,420
Scott: Then- At least you still have normal brakes.

102
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,320
Rym: My power steering ceases to function.

103
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:14,500
Scott: Oh, now it's going to be real hard to drive.

104
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:15,256
Rym: Yes.

105
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:21,460
Rym: So I obviously had made the right decision, and I kind of hobble into this mechanic, but I've seen this mechanic.

106
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,418
Rym: I've driven past it.

107
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,659
Rym: I've never so much as stopped anywhere near this guy.

108
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,236
Scott: And you say, "Hey, man, you got a battery in

109
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:29,458
Scott: there?".

110
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,819
Rym: No, so I pull in, and I leave the car running, because once I turn it off- It's over.

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,820
Scott: Well, if you're at the mechanic, I would feel safe turning it off.

112
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,180
Rym: Yeah, yeah, so I don't want them to have to drag the car into their little bit.

113
00:05:42,506 --> 00:05:42,839
Scott: Oh, that's true.

114
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,182
Rym: So I walk in, and I'm like, my battery came on, and he's like, "I ever had a problem with your

115
00:05:48,224 --> 00:05:48,636
Rym: alternator?".

116
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,293
Rym: And I said, "I've never had a problem with this

117
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:50,576
Rym: car.".

118
00:05:51,448 --> 00:05:52,000
Scott: Well, you have.

119
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:57,220
Rym: No, I had one problem a long time ago that was resolved handily for almost no money.

120
00:05:58,141 --> 00:06:01,039
Rym: In fact, the problem was so simple, I could have fixed it myself if I'd known.

121
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,420
Rym: But this car has had no major repairs ever.

122
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,358
Scott: Well, except for the time you crushed it.

123
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:11,280
Rym: Well, yeah, when I was involved in a seven-car pileup on 490 outside of Rochester.

124
00:06:12,162 --> 00:06:14,520
Rym: But even then, that was purely cosmetic damage.

125
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:16,400
Rym: The car itself has had no repairs.

126
00:06:17,604 --> 00:06:20,100
Rym: And, you know, why would the alternator suddenly fail?

127
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:21,660
Rym: It's been fine forever, but, you know, he tested.

128
00:06:22,141 --> 00:06:24,360
Scott: Because moving parts don't last forever.

129
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,860
Rym: Yeah, but it failed completely.

130
00:06:26,322 --> 00:06:27,059
Scott: Entropy is the win.

131
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,840
Rym: It failed completely and suddenly.

132
00:06:30,241 --> 00:06:30,536
Scott: All right.

133
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:39,000
Rym: So the guy replaces my alternator, and while he's doing this, I tell him, "Replace my drive train belt thingy," because that thing is also original.

134
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,333
Rym: And he's like, "Yeah, it's kind of

135
00:06:40,393 --> 00:06:40,859
Rym: old-looking.".

136
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,059
Rym: And it's cheap to do, since he's taking the alternator off anyway.

137
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,880
Rym: But more importantly, I tell him, "And while you're at it, replace that battery.

138
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,075
Rym: It's the original freaking

139
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:48,420
Rym: battery.".

140
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:49,040
Rym: He's like, "Really?

141
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:49,887
Rym: Really?".

142
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,655
Rym: And I'm like, "Yeah, it's almost 10 years

143
00:06:51,796 --> 00:06:51,877
Rym: old.".

144
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:53,799
Rym: He's like, "You've never done anything to

145
00:06:53,859 --> 00:06:53,900
Rym: it?".

146
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,174
Rym: He's like, "I've never even looked at

147
00:06:55,235 --> 00:06:55,276
Rym: it.".

148
00:06:56,462 --> 00:06:58,357
Rym: And he's like, "All right, I'll replace

149
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:58,458
Rym: it.".

150
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,754
Rym: "Yeah, goddamn, shouldn't have left that in

151
00:07:00,794 --> 00:07:00,976
Rym: there.".

152
00:07:01,762 --> 00:07:03,320
Rym: So then he's replacing the alternator.

153
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,694
Rym: He comes out and he says, "Come

154
00:07:04,735 --> 00:07:04,856
Rym: here.".

155
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,518
Rym: So I come out and he says, "You're sure this is the original

156
00:07:07,558 --> 00:07:07,800
Rym: battery?".

157
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,958
Rym: I'm like, "Yes, this is the battery that came with the car when it was

158
00:07:09,998 --> 00:07:10,099
Rym: new.".

159
00:07:10,381 --> 00:07:13,280
Rym: And he says, "This battery is acting like a brand new battery.

160
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,334
Rym: There's no reason to replace

161
00:07:14,354 --> 00:07:14,395
Rym: it.".

162
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,539
Scott: - What the hell?

163
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,760
Rym: - This battery is like the battery of the gods.

164
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:24,080
Scott: - I think that there must be something wrong with the battery that fools the detection machines that test the battery.

165
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,340
Rym: - Because the battery is just fine.

166
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:34,640
Rym: Not only is the battery fine, but despite the fact that it wasn't being charged for some amount of time, it managed to get me like eight miles back to a mechanic.

167
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:42,320
Scott: - I think I'll have to submit the battery to some battery test lab and then they can make more batteries like it for other applications like laptops.

168
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,560
Rym: - Well, see, because my family has a history of appliances and cars lasting far longer than they should.

169
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:56,920
Scott: - Wait, you're suggesting somehow your genealogy is responsible for a magical physics-defying battery?

170
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:02,920
Rym: - Well, you know, that is obviously the only logical solution because random chance, there's no way.

171
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,060
Rym: I mean, what?

172
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,320
Rym: Ah, ah, call Randy.

173
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:14,638
Rym: But I mean, no, seriously, my grandparents have a fridge that they've had since the '50s, and it's without service, been working perfectly to this day, and they still use it.

174
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,080
Scott: - Hey, what you gonna do?

175
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,097
Rym: - Keep using it.

176
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,309
Scott: - Yep.

177
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,320
Rym: - Yeah, so I've still got that battery.

178
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,029
Rym: That battery has seen 130,000 miles and almost 10 years of driving.

179
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:24,578
Scott: - Cool.

180
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,379
Rym: - And that's the end of my story.

181
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,780
Rym: I got to work two hours late, no one batted an eye.

182
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,080
Scott: - Yeah, so I'm at work today and not doing any work, of course.

183
00:08:33,841 --> 00:08:39,659
Scott: And I realize, hey, 'cause I set up this website at work where people can apply to work at our company.

184
00:08:40,662 --> 00:08:43,558
Scott: So I checked it to see if there were any new applications, and there were.

185
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,555
Scott: So I emailed my boss, "Hey, here's some

186
00:08:45,595 --> 00:08:46,080
Scott: applications.".

187
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,240
Scott: And he said, "Cool," like a second later.

188
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,209
Scott: So then I'm like, "Oh yeah, I keep forgetting I'm taking off Katsu-kan,".

189
00:08:53,229 --> 00:08:53,653
Scott: and he says,

190
00:08:53,874 --> 00:08:54,176
Scott: "Okay.".

191
00:08:54,823 --> 00:08:55,209
Scott: And I'm like,

192
00:08:55,229 --> 00:08:55,371
Scott: "Huh.".

193
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:04,496
Scott: Then I'm like, "Since you're responding so quickly, can we discuss this issue that, you know, you keep avoiding and never

194
00:09:04,556 --> 00:09:04,979
Scott: discussing?".

195
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,440
Rym: - The thing you're supposed to be working on, but no one ever gets back with you?

196
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,859
Scott: - Well, it's more like a recent problem that's come up.

197
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,200
Scott: that's under my responsibility, and I need someone else to do something.

198
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:15,640
Scott: I can't just do it all on my own.

199
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,140
Scott: I need some discussion, some decision-making.

200
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,900
Rym: - Welcome to my goddamn world.

201
00:09:20,021 --> 00:09:25,859
Rym: I could do all the work I'm given at any job I've ever had in like one day a week if it weren't for the fact that I have to rely on other people.

202
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,280
Scott: - Yeah, so he doesn't respond immediately.

203
00:09:32,141 --> 00:09:32,454
Scott: (laughing).

204
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:33,767
Scott: - The other things.

205
00:09:33,848 --> 00:09:36,579
Scott: I emailed him, he responded within a second with one word.

206
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,920
Scott: This one, no immediate response.

207
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:45,700
Scott: A few hours later, doo-doo, there's an Outlook email, and it says, "Yeah, can we talk about that on Monday?

208
00:09:46,262 --> 00:09:47,895
Scott: I'm on vacation in the Dominican

209
00:09:47,915 --> 00:09:48,318
Scott: Republic.".

210
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:48,756
Rym: - What?

211
00:09:50,144 --> 00:09:50,996
Scott: Why was he checking in?

212
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,098
Scott: See, I don't get this.

213
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,040
Scott: - Well, with the Blackberry action.

214
00:09:53,180 --> 00:10:14,557
Rym: - No, that's not cool, 'cause everyone I work with, if they have any meat, they'll check their work email every day when they're on vacation, and they check it over the weekends, and they check it at night, and as far as I'm concerned, unless I'm on call for something specific, like make sure this doesn't break overnight on this day, I turn my pager off, and I don't even think about work until eight in the morning the next

215
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:14,659
Scott: day.

216
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,680
Scott: - The thing is, when you have a smartphone, you've got all your emails going to this one device.

217
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,480
Rym: - Oh, I'd set up a filter that would queue up and not show me work email on weekends.

218
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,079
Rym: - You can't do that.

219
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,879
Rym: - Yeah, I could.

220
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,280
Scott: It'd be difficult.

221
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
Rym: - Plus, I wouldn't even send my real email to a smartphone.

222
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:38,540
Rym: Email is, to me, exists solely to talk to people who aren't on aim, I can't call, and I want a record of my conversation in case I need to cover my own ass later.

223
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,995
Scott: - Well, that's what people do, and--.

224
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,860
Rym: - God, most email I send at work these days is simply proving that I put due diligence forth on something.

225
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:55,060
Scott: - Yeah, so it made me realize, not only does my work not know or care what I do most of the time, but apparently I don't know what they do.

226
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:01,500
Scott: I mean, think about this, Rym, if your boss went on vacation to the Dominican Republic next week, all week, would you know?

227
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,200
Rym: - God, well, it depends.

228
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:15,360
Rym: I mean, at IBM, there'd be a lot of times where we'd be sitting around, and something would be going down, and we'd be like, all right, we need to talk to the boss, and then someone would ask the ever-present question, where is the boss?

229
00:11:15,726 --> 00:11:16,379
Rym: Is she in today?

230
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:18,759
Rym: I thought I saw her this morning, but I wasn't sure.

231
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:20,060
Rym: Is she in her office?

232
00:11:20,402 --> 00:11:22,356
Rym: Well, she's not on same time, huh.

233
00:11:24,303 --> 00:11:29,100
Rym: But then again, in my work now, I get a month's notice if anyone's gonna be gone for five minutes.

234
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,740
Scott: - Yeah, so I want everyone out there to think about this.

235
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,039
Scott: Maybe start a thread in the forum.

236
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,319
Scott: If your boss went on vacation, would you know about it?

237
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:44,519
Scott: I mean, my boss apparently is in the Dominican Republic all week, and I had no clue until I tried to talk to him, which I don't do so often.

238
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,079
Rym: - Huh, of course, see, I'm a weird case, 'cause I rarely have a boss straight up.

239
00:11:50,340 --> 00:12:00,699
Scott: - Well, I mean, I don't know if there's technically, there isn't sort of this boss kind of thing, but I mean, I'm the programmer, and he's a CTO, so he's above me.

240
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:07,639
Rym: - Yeah, I mean, there's a person who clearly, this is the person who will be giving you assignments, and without their input, you won't do anything new.

241
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,478
Scott: - Uh-huh.

242
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,200
Rym: - That's what I would call a boss, at least in the technology world.

243
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,060
Scott: - I don't know, it's sorta, it's weird.

244
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,799
Scott: - 'Cause really, in technology-- - The point is, my job is fucked up, and I'm trying to find a new one.

245
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:29,417
Rym: - Yeah, I would be trying to find a new one, except my company pays me quite a bit, considering how, I guess, non-technical the job requirements actually are.

246
00:12:30,942 --> 00:12:36,280
Rym: But yes, it's not Monday, it's Thursday, so we're allowed to go on rants, but we're not gonna go too long.

247
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,359
Scott: - Let's move on some news.

248
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:52,959
Rym: - All right, so on Digg, you might've seen that there was this thing about how, hey, if you microwave a wet sponge for 30 seconds or so, you can de-germify it, clean it up, and whatever, and now it'll be like a brand new sponge, and it won't smell bad.

249
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,998
Scott: - It makes sense, unless you have the problem I have, which is where the sponges get shredded by knives, 'cause we don't have a dishwasher.

250
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:08,000
Scott: So you have to clean all the knives with the sponge, and thus the sponges get cut up, and then I needed to change the sponge out, even if the sponge is perfectly clean.

251
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,439
Rym: - Also the forks and some of the spatulas, they just do a number on our sponges.

252
00:13:12,445 --> 00:13:15,579
Scott: As soon as you get a dishwasher, we'll be able to use a lot fewer sponges.

253
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:21,139
Rym: - But yeah, this is old news, but for some reason it was all over Digg, and even some mainstream media picked up on it a little bit.

254
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:23,931
Rym: The news here is that there

255
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:24,313
Scott: has been a

256
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:39,399
Rym: follow-up set of stories on every major news outlet today, talking about the numerous fires, injuries, and accidents that have come about as a result of people who probably don't know much about physics and have no business owning a microwave trying to emulate this trick.

257
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,760
Scott: - Oh my God.

258
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:47,331
Rym: - Apparently a lot of people heard about this through various means and thought, "Hey, that's a great

259
00:13:47,412 --> 00:13:47,675
Rym: idea.".

260
00:13:48,322 --> 00:13:59,600
Rym: So they went to their microwave, they dutifully put their dry, not soaked in water sponge in the microwave, which is the same as putting nothing in the microwave.

261
00:14:00,563 --> 00:14:05,240
Rym: They then turned the microwave on for like five minutes and walked away, assuming it would sterilize the sponge.

262
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,399
Scott: - Five minutes?

263
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,300
Rym: - Well in many cases, they just didn't put a wet sponge in.

264
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:11,660
Rym: I mean, running an empty microwave is not the best idea.

265
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,459
Scott: - All right, now go ahead.

266
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,540
Scott: Did anyone put some steel wool or a Brillo pad in there?

267
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:16,943
Scott: - Yes.

268
00:14:16,963 --> 00:14:18,600
Scott: - Oh, oh God.

269
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,340
Rym: - So now, there are stories on CNN and MSNBC about such things as, "Yes, you can do this.

270
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,719
Rym: "Make sure you wet the sponge.

271
00:14:26,061 --> 00:14:28,280
Rym: "Make sure your sponge does not contain metal.

272
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,159
Rym: "Make sure you keep an eye on it.

273
00:14:30,381 --> 00:14:32,299
Rym: "Make sure you only do it for a short amount of time.

274
00:14:32,722 --> 00:14:34,320
Rym: "Be warned, the sponge will be hot.

275
00:14:34,401 --> 00:14:35,297
Rym: "when you try to remove

276
00:14:35,338 --> 00:14:35,378
Rym: it.".

277
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,720
Scott: - Yeah, this actually kind of fooled me for a second.

278
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,539
Scott: Like when I saw the story on Digg, I saw the headline only, I didn't read it.

279
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,414
Scott: I said, "That makes a lot of sense,

280
00:14:43,454 --> 00:14:43,817
Scott: yeah.".

281
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,200
Scott: And I'm like, "Someone should just make a dishwasher.

282
00:14:46,724 --> 00:14:48,577
Scott: "that uses microwaves to clean all the

283
00:14:48,618 --> 00:14:48,900
Scott: dishes.".

284
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,276
Scott: And then I said, "Wait a minute, "you couldn't put silverware in

285
00:14:52,337 --> 00:14:52,679
Scott: there.".

286
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,219
Rym: - Not at all.

287
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,618
Scott: - But other than that, it's an okay idea when you think about it.

288
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:02,240
Scott: If something is microwave safe, there's no reason you couldn't clean it with microwaves.

289
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,299
Rym: - Well, except that microwaves wouldn't remove physical gunk, all it would do is disinfect.

290
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:06,938
Scott: - Eventually they would.

291
00:15:08,101 --> 00:15:11,320
Rym: - Nah, 'cause depending on the gunk, it might not even burn or anything.

292
00:15:12,381 --> 00:15:18,200
Rym: Most of the microwaves died because if you run microwaves, especially older ones without anything in 'em, they'll just burn themselves out.

293
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,160
Scott: - Mm, I guess maybe.

294
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,120
Scott: a dishwasher with some sort of microwave action might, it might be okay.

295
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,459
Rym: - Most modern dishwashers basically steam clean--.

296
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,660
Scott: - Yeah, well they have the steam clean super heat burning everything to death function.

297
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,099
Rym: - Yeah, which we'd probably use.

298
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,520
Scott: - They use it once in a while to super clean the dishes.

299
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,300
Rym: - Once a month to clean all the silverware.

300
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Scott: - Yeah, it makes all the dishes real hot though, like hotter than the microwave.

301
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,159
Scott: - That's fine.

302
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:44,716
Rym: We have enough dishes to entertain like 40 people.

303
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,759
Scott: I don't think-- - I don't think we, oh.

304
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,548
Rym: - Well, silverware.

305
00:15:47,568 --> 00:15:48,439
Scott: - Yeah, oh, okay.

306
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,760
Rym: - We have enough silverware to entertain 40 people.

307
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,659
Scott: - Hey, if you count the plastic silverware, yes.

308
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,380
Rym: - Oh God, if you count the plastic silverware.

309
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,960
Scott: - All right, so remember Diebold?

310
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,000
Rym: - I'm well aware of the company called Diebold.

311
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,699
Rym: - Yeah, well, apparently-- - They make voting machines for those of you who are unawares.

312
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,140
Scott: - Incredibly insecure and faulty voting, electronic voting machines.

313
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,280
Rym: - Lots of shady business going around left and right.

314
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:21,260
Scott: - Yes, the government trusts this, the US government trusts this company to make sure that electronic voting works and is not hacked or frauded or anything.

315
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,700
Rym: - Well, these machines have already been compromised in almost every single way possible.

316
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,540
Rym: Are you telling me that the last possible way has been compromised?

317
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:38,840
Scott: - Well, apparently, the company Diebold on their website, oh, okay, these voting machines all have a key that you can use to physically open them, all right?

318
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,239
Scott: And that's pretty secure, a key.

319
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,078
Scott: I mean, this key's not the most secure thing in the world, but you gotta copy a key, it's not--.

320
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,460
Rym: - Yeah, well, I mean, think about it, even if-- - You need to call a locksmith to sit there.

321
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:59,899
Rym: - Well, no, even if it's a pickable lock, 'cause almost all locks are easily pickable, it takes a non-trivially amount of time, like, it takes a couple minutes, and you can't just sit there using a bump key inside of the voting booth, they'll notice.

322
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:05,680
Scott: - Yeah, and nobody's gonna have these keys except election workers and Diebold themselves.

323
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,400
Rym: - Granted, there were corrupt election workers at the most recent election where I voted, but I digress.

324
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:18,839
Scott: - Yes, anyway, remember how Princeton was doing a study on these voting machines and showed how they were all insecure and everything?

325
00:17:19,741 --> 00:17:28,319
Scott: Well, they noticed on the Diebold website, because if you're studying Diebold machines, you're gonna go to Diebold's website, that there was a picture of the key.

326
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,840
Rym: - Um, was this the high resolution picture, per chance?

327
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,400
Scott: - It wasn't, I don't know how high the resolution was.

328
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:40,680
Rym: - What, they've got like an HDTV screenshot fully zoomed in of the keys on it?

329
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:40,760
Rym: -

330
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:59,040
Scott: I don't know, but they took the picture of the key, they went to Ace Hardware, they got some similar looking keys, and they sculpted the keys, you know, into look like the one in the picture, and two out of the three keys opened the test voting machine that they had for their lab.

331
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,160
Rym: - Outstanding.

332
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:12,300
Scott: - So Diebold realized this mistake, and changed the picture on the website to a picture of a digital key card, instead of the physical key to open the voting machines.

333
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,100
Rym: - Yeah, way to close that barn door, I'm sure those horses will.

334
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,677
Scott: - That's what it says right here.

335
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,517
Scott: It says, "Shutting the barn door after horse has

336
00:18:21,577 --> 00:18:21,778
Scott: left.".

337
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:28,099
Rym: - See, you gotta be in that, like in WarioWare, smooth moves when those customers are trying to get out of your store, you just gotta pull that thing down.

338
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,560
Scott: - That's right, that's right.

339
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,900
Rym: - Of course, maybe if you just never opened it in the first place.

340
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:42,180
Scott: - Yeah, this is just a lesson in security, and for everyone out there who, you know, is not security minded, don't put a picture of your frickin' key anywhere.

341
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,130
Rym: - Things of the day.

342
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,510
Rym: So cats don't like to get wet, that is well known.

343
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:01,350
Rym: I have watched people attempt to watch cats who did not want to be washed, and serious injuries have resulted.

344
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:05,950
Scott: - I've always seen people who use like, spray bottles of water to like, tame their cats.

345
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,510
Rym: - That doesn't wash them, however.

346
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,670
Scott: - No, it doesn't wash them.

347
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:12,090
Rym: - All that does is piss them off and cause them to further plot your demise.

348
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,290
Scott: - All right.

349
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,690
Rym: - So basically, I've seen people wash cats.

350
00:19:16,751 --> 00:19:23,470
Rym: that tends to involve wearing leather gloves, holding the cat at arm's length, into a spray of water, and holding it there.

351
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,850
Scott: - You'll get to scratch up your arms pretty bad.

352
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,930
Rym: - That's why you tend to wear protective equipment.

353
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:33,510
Scott: - Can't you just take your cat to like a grooming place that'll wash your cat for you?

354
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:38,389
Rym: - Well you can, and thanks to the power of the internet, we now know what goes on in many of these places.

355
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,790
Rym: Apparently there's a product that is basically a torture chamber for cats.

356
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:43,287
Rym: - What?

357
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,930
Rym: - It's this box, and it's called like a pet spa.

358
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:53,730
Scott: - Wait, wait, wait, if you took it to a grooming place, wouldn't like, one person just hold the cat, and then another person wash it for you?

359
00:19:53,930 --> 00:20:00,010
Rym: - That's not, I mean, cats are pretty strong, and you're gonna have to pretty much hold the cat's arms and legs so it doesn't scratch everybody.

360
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:04,728
Rym: I imagine they use this on cats that are particularly, I don't know, evil.

361
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:15,348
Rym: But, all right, so this video is kinda, I mean it's funny, but at the same time, that poor cat, but at the same time, the cat probably smelled a little bit better when this was all over.

362
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:16,510
Scott: - Okay.

363
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:21,409
Rym: - So they take this cat, and they put it in this box with a big window door.

364
00:20:21,711 --> 00:20:23,149
Rym: It looks like a washing machine.

365
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:29,087
Rym: So they close the door, and the cat's just kinda sittin' there like, the fuck is this shit, childs?

366
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:30,689
Rym: What's goin' on?

367
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,703
Rym: The cat's lookin' around like, ugh.

368
00:20:32,871 --> 00:20:37,510
Rym: Then the guy walks up, and he punches in some settings, like air temperature and water temperature and whatever.

369
00:20:38,711 --> 00:20:43,408
Rym: And the cat suddenly jumps and looks around with his look of, oh no, you didn't.

370
00:20:45,673 --> 00:20:48,830
Rym: And it's at this moment that water starts to bubble up a little bit in the bottom.

371
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:55,110
Rym: And the cat looks at the water and looks out the window, and that cat is ready to kill anyone.

372
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,005
Rym: (laughing).

373
00:20:56,351 --> 00:21:02,529
Rym: Now this bubble of water turns into multi-directional spray, and at this point, the cat loses it.

374
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:14,307
Rym: And there's no way out, and the cat doesn't, the cat is basically like a guy screamin', fallin' off of a building, where eventually you just run out of breath and stop screamin', and just kinda take it.

375
00:21:14,991 --> 00:21:20,189
Rym: The cats go freakin' out and freakin' out, press A, press A, water's in the room, it's gettin' you wet.

376
00:21:21,432 --> 00:21:28,009
Rym: And then finally, the cat just gets so tired that it just kinda half-assedly is poking at the door like, bastards, all of you.

377
00:21:29,614 --> 00:21:36,950
Rym: And when they finally take the cat out, it has this look of just, I can't describe how angry and tired this cat looks.

378
00:21:37,953 --> 00:21:41,329
Rym: I feel bad for it, but at the same time, how else are you gonna wash a cat?

379
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,368
Scott: - The hose.

380
00:21:44,413 --> 00:21:45,028
Scott: Hoses work.

381
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,530
Rym: - It's pretty hilarious.

382
00:21:47,331 --> 00:21:52,827
Rym: And don't think it cruel of me that I laugh, because I guarantee that you will laugh at least a little bit at this.

383
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,449
Scott: - How can you not?

384
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,690
Rym: - Oh my God.

385
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:05,269
Scott: - So apparently there's a trivia game show in Britain, and I don't know the name of it, but someone else probably does, and they're gonna yell at me.

386
00:22:05,671 --> 00:22:08,089
Scott: So I'm not even gonna say the name, because I might be wrong.

387
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:16,450
Scott: But anyway, it appears from watching this video on YouTube that the way the show works is you choose a topic for yourself.

388
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:19,689
Scott: Like, I could go on and say, ask me about Linux.

389
00:22:20,234 --> 00:22:21,989
Scott: Yeah, that's right, ask me about Linux.

390
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,569
Scott: Oh look, I know everything.

391
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:24,330
Scott: Pund.

392
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:32,470
Scott: And then at the second part of the show, they ask you general stuff, which is usually stuff you have no idea.

393
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,690
Rym: - Like pop star blah, football team blah.

394
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:36,949
Scott: - Yeah, and you go, ah shit.

395
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:41,110
Scott: But, you know, and then I guess whoever, when you get questions right, you get points.

396
00:22:41,752 --> 00:22:43,390
Scott: It seems pretty good, it's kinda fun.

397
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:49,562
Scott: Anyway, this chick went on the show, and she says, yeah, ask me about H.P.

398
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:50,910
Scott: Lovecraft, that's all right.

399
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:51,455
Scott: - Ooh.

400
00:22:51,476 --> 00:22:52,110
Scott: - That's right.

401
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:53,930
Scott: And she's like, yeah, I know that shit.

402
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:54,907
Scott: What you gonna do about it?

403
00:22:55,493 --> 00:22:56,168
Scott: And it's pretty cool.

404
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,210
Rym: - I gotta say-- - You're the chicks in Britain.

405
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,206
Rym: - I'm a huge fan of H.P.

406
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,870
Rym: Lovecraft, but I couldn't answer three quarters of those questions.

407
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,504
Scott: - Yeah, and for anyone who, you know, is still kinda new to the whole H.P.

408
00:23:08,605 --> 00:23:11,530
Scott: Lovecraft thing, you might learn something watching this.

409
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:16,260
Scott: 'Cause like in the middle part, the host guy kinda questions her out about H.P.

410
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:18,110
Scott: Lovecraft a little bit, and she gives you some information.

411
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,569
Scott: Of course, you'll probably learn more going to Wikipedia, but hey.

412
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,729
Rym: - Or just reading the Colorado of Space.

413
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,369
Scott: - Yeah, or any of those other--.

414
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,510
Rym: - Or the thing on the doorstep.

415
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,550
Scott: - Or the Call of Cthulhu.

416
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,170
Rym: - Tales of Horror and the Macabre.

417
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:29,889
Rym: - Yeah, whatever.

418
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,290
Rym: - Tales of Terror and Death.

419
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,329
Scott: - Yeah, so, it's pretty cool, you should watch it.

420
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,068
Scott: I don't know, this actually looks like a pretty cool quiz show.

421
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:43,690
Scott: You know, it's definitely a lot better than that millionaire where I just get frustrated and go, goddamn, you're stupid, goddamn.

422
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,182
Rym: (laughing) What orbits around God?

423
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:54,390
Rym: Without further ado, we've been doing a lot of hard-hitting episodes lately.

424
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,270
Scott: Just in terms of-- - At least we think we have.

425
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:03,090
Rym: - Not in terms of particularly our content or the way we handle the show, but in terms of things that we particularly like.

426
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,689
Rym: I mean, Dave and Joel talk a lot about things they don't like.

427
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:12,150
Rym: We talk a lot about things we like, and this is something we like perhaps more than almost anything.

428
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,270
Scott: - I don't know about that.

429
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,990
Scott: - We like it a lot, though, a whole lot.

430
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,249
Scott: - Well, consider-- - We like it as much as you like Initial D.

431
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,150
Rym: - I think I like it more than Initial D. I think I like it twice as much as I like Initial D.

432
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,748
Scott: - Oh, that's a whole lot of liking going on.

433
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:23,470
Scott: - It is, goddamn.

434
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,550
Scott: - I like it as much as I like Initial D, which is a lot.

435
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:30,610
Rym: - Odoru Daisousasen.

436
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:33,070
Scott: - Hey, hey, everyone listen to that carefully.

437
00:24:35,538 --> 00:24:41,089
Scott: Odoru Dais-- - So-- - I had it right, and now when I actually try to do it on the show, Daisousasen.

438
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:48,830
Rym: - Yes, now the reason we say it and bring that up is that when we first heard of this and we found out, there's a whole story as to how we came up to this.

439
00:24:49,091 --> 00:24:54,090
Rym: There were many near misses where we almost found out about this but didn't, due to our own stupidity.

440
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,566
Scott: - We'd be like, oh, doo doo, D.C.

441
00:24:56,606 --> 00:24:57,070
Scott: Sousen.

442
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,509
Rym: - Well, we didn't even know what it was.

443
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,124
Rym: - Yeah, yeah.

444
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:05,949
Rym: - An event for a longest time, I was like, Odoru Daisousasen, and finally our friend Katsu was like, RM, it's not how you say it.

445
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,728
Scott: - Yep, Daisousasen, Sousasen.

446
00:25:11,137 --> 00:25:11,528
Scott: - O-A-E.

447
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:21,769
Rym: - Before we go into the details of what exactly this is, other than the fact that it's awesome, I think we should give you a little bit of backstory as to how we discovered it, 'cause it's a convoluted and interesting tale.

448
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,382
Scott: - Mm-hmm.

449
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:38,343
Rym: - You see, now remember, there's a pre-story before any of this when I was a freshman at RIT and our friend Katsu was a freshman, and he would talk fairly often about this cop drama from Japan that he was a big fan of, and we all just kinda totally brushed it off 'cause we had no way to see it, we

450
00:25:38,364 --> 00:25:38,606
Scott: didn't--.

451
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,930
Scott: - I remember him talking about it freshman year.

452
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,849
Rym: - I remember it partly because he had a scheme to try to fan sub it.

453
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,890
Scott: - See, I remember that coming later, but it doesn't really matter.

454
00:25:48,070 --> 00:26:07,747
Rym: - And he tried, he wanted my help, and I didn't know a lot about that sort of thing, I didn't have a genlock, and I didn't have all the good software to do it well nowadays, so we tried a little bit, I watched an episode raw, and I didn't know what it was, and I didn't understand it, so I didn't think it was that funny, and after a little while, we just kinda ignored it, and I forgot about it.

455
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:30,612
Rym: - Fast forward, playing DDR, we're playing the song that is perhaps my second favorite song in DDR, and Katsu says to us, "Hey, that's the theme song "to my cop

456
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:30,877
Rym: show.".

457
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:38,019
Scott: - See, I don't even remember that particular incident, I just remember somehow, we had this song in DDR.

458
00:26:38,442 --> 00:26:49,539
Scott: that was a cool song that we liked to do, and somehow, it came into my brain from someone else that there's a TV show about police that goes with this song here.

459
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:56,097
Rym: - See, I think it might have been for me, because when I played with Katsu, and then Katsu was like, "This is from that cop show,".

460
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:57,490
Rym: and I was like, "Oh,

461
00:26:57,591 --> 00:26:58,136
Rym: really?".

462
00:26:59,028 --> 00:26:59,720
Rym: Rhythm and police.

463
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:13,380
Scott: - But yeah, all I knew for the longest time was rhythm and police, it's a song in DDR, it's a cop show of some sort, and the theme song is really cool, and it's in DDR, and I like to dance it, and I wish I could find the show in English.

464
00:27:13,762 --> 00:27:23,945
Rym: So then, we talked about it for a few days off and on, and it came up, and the gist was, Katsu had a bunch of it, untranslated, and that was basically the end of that, we weren't gonna--.

465
00:27:23,965 --> 00:27:25,236
Scott: - Yeah, I'm not even, yeah.

466
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,080
Rym: - I tried to watch an episode or two with him kinda translating, but I didn't have the magic.

467
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:32,079
Rym: So whatever, forget about it.

468
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,560
Rym: Fast forward to the future.

469
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,877
Scott: - Well, every once in a while, we would play the song, and we would always think, "Ah, all right, there's a

470
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:38,119
Scott: show.".

471
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,260
Rym: - It's just like the tapestry with your family.

472
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,753
Rym: It would just come up, and like, "Yeah, we should do something, eh,

473
00:27:42,793 --> 00:27:43,178
Rym: whatever.".

474
00:27:44,264 --> 00:27:45,480
Rym: So then, fast forward further.

475
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,720
Rym: We have the Video Barn, which is the most awesome--.

476
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:58,620
Scott: - Well, in Rochester, in, well, Henrietta, Rochester, New York, near RIT, there is a video rental place, much like a Blockbuster, however not Blockbuster, it is Video Barn.

477
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,340
Rym: - Yeah, here's the caliber of this place.

478
00:28:00,581 --> 00:28:09,280
Rym: We walked in, and we saw some movie that had just gibberish on it, moon language, but written over it in marker was very good sword fighting.

479
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,176
Scott: - I think it said, "Sword fighting very

480
00:28:11,237 --> 00:28:11,439
Scott: good.".

481
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,818
Rym: - Something like that, so we decided--.

482
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,879
Scott: - What was that, Princess Blade?

483
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:17,059
Rym: - Princess Blade, which was a crap movie, but-- - Sword fighting very good.

484
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,740
Rym: - Sword fighting very good indeed.

485
00:28:19,724 --> 00:28:23,955
Rym: And you know, we went there once, we're like, "Hey, you ever heard of this movie called "Attack the Gas

486
00:28:23,975 --> 00:28:24,300
Rym: Station?".

487
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,394
Scott: - The guy reaches behind him, pulls the DVD out, and it's like, "Here you

488
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:27,456
Scott: go.".

489
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,656
Rym: - Here you go, and then we bring it back, he's like, "They liked it, didn't

490
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:30,737
Rym: ya?".

491
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,660
Scott: - These guys are pretty awesome.

492
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,520
Scott: It's like the best damn video store in the world.

493
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:44,298
Scott: I mean, not only did they have all sorts of awesome Asian films, not only did they have basically every anime ever released in the United States on VHS or DVD.

494
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,659
Rym: - Including a lot of Japanese stuff.

495
00:28:46,961 --> 00:28:50,976
Scott: - Yeah, not only did they have a huge selection of porn that I never looked at.

496
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,700
Scott: - Well, we walked in once.

497
00:28:52,800 --> 00:29:00,700
Scott: - We walked in once, and let me tell you, the porn section of the video store looks a lot like really colorful manga from far away.

498
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,520
Scott: - Yeah, until you get up close and-- - It looks like a bunch of teen magazines from far away.

499
00:29:05,301 --> 00:29:12,719
Scott: With all these bright magenta and yellow colors all over the place, and so that's what I remember from going back there for like five seconds.

500
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,720
Scott: - So Scott and I would often just-- - Oh yeah, they also had basically every movie ever.

501
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,080
Rym: - Yeah, especially obscure stuff, and art house stuff.

502
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:28,320
Rym: So Scott and I used to go a lot and just spend a half hour looking, pick a movie based on the cover.

503
00:29:28,741 --> 00:29:37,619
Rym: Usually we'd look for more than one Yakuza, perhaps some lightning in the background, anything like that, anything-- - We always had trouble remembering to return stuff, the video bar.

504
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,919
Rym: - Yeah, but they never cared.

505
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:39,637
Scott: - No, they didn't.

506
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,899
Rym: - 'Cause they knew us, and they seemed to be really cool and kinda with it.

507
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,880
Scott: - Yeah, anyone who was renting awesome movies, they liked.

508
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,118
Scott: Anyone who was renting normal stuff, they were like, whatever.

509
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,519
Rym: - And they never steered us wrong.

510
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,580
Rym: If they recommended something, it was solid gold.

511
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:51,969
Scott: - Yep.

512
00:29:52,641 --> 00:30:00,859
Rym: - So one day, Scott and I are there, and we don't have katsu around or anything, and we see this movie called Bayside Shakedown, and I'm like, hey.

513
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,520
Scott: - I kinda wanted to get this ninja movie or something.

514
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,600
Rym: - But I'm like, hey, wait a minute.

515
00:30:04,981 --> 00:30:08,860
Rym: That guy kinda looks like the guy from that cop show that katsu always talks about.

516
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,460
Scott: - I'm like, what?

517
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,700
Scott: Are you saying that that's the rhythm and police whatnot?

518
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,218
Rym: - And I'm like, I don't know.

519
00:30:13,582 --> 00:30:15,539
Rym: So we're reading the back of it, and we're trying to figure it out.

520
00:30:15,921 --> 00:30:18,359
Rym: I tried to call katsu a bunch of times, but I couldn't get ahold of him.

521
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,100
Scott: - Yeah, and I'm like, I don't know if this is it, man.

522
00:30:21,421 --> 00:30:23,820
Scott: It looks like just some random police movie.

523
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:28,859
Rym: - So we decide after a while, it's either the ninja movie or this, and we decide we can't pass this up.

524
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,500
Rym: There's a chance.

525
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,580
Rym: Worst case, it sucks.

526
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,899
Rym: We deal with it, my bad.

527
00:30:32,841 --> 00:30:35,378
Rym: So we take it home, and we watch it.

528
00:30:35,903 --> 00:30:39,699
Rym: And we're not sure if it's the thing until the music starts.

529
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,679
Rym: And at that point, we knew that we had struck gold.

530
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,597
Rym: This was it.

531
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:44,704
Rym: We didn't know.

532
00:30:45,046 --> 00:30:47,200
Rym: TV show, movie, multiple movies, whatever.

533
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:53,539
Rym: All we knew was that this was a movie about the exact same thing that that cop show was.

534
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:58,020
Scott: - It was a movie that was the thing the DDR song came from.

535
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:06,079
Rym: - Now, not only is this movie so amazing, not only should we tell movies you should see to review it, why'd we tell them to do Attack the Gas Station?

536
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,519
Scott: - No, Attack the Gas Station, I think, is more important.

537
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,120
Rym: - Yeah, but they should do this.

538
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,240
Scott: - I like this as much as I like Attack the Gas Station.

539
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:12,696
Rym: - Yeah, me too.

540
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,219
Rym: We then immediately showed it to a bunch of other people, like the whole crew.

541
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,580
Scott: - It was like, oh shit, we found an awesome movie.

542
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,600
Scott: We must show everyone.

543
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,600
Rym: - And then we showed it to more people.

544
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,857
Rym: We rented it multiple times.

545
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,019
Scott: - I think they did a fireside Friday with it.

546
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:25,484
Scott: - Yep.

547
00:31:25,504 --> 00:31:26,600
Scott: - Oh no, I remember.

548
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,172
Scott: - Yeah.

549
00:31:27,193 --> 00:31:27,317
Rym: - Yeah.

550
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:32,679
Rym: - So then, I was on the board of this anime club, this huge anime club for three years.

551
00:31:33,123 --> 00:31:40,940
Rym: And I was president, I was riding high, I was at the peak of my popularity at RIT, I had my adoring fans, blah, blah, blah.

552
00:31:41,421 --> 00:31:47,100
Rym: But the tradition at RIT is that when a president resigns at the end of his term, before he graduates--.

553
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,418
Scott: - But when an anime club president resigns.

554
00:31:49,640 --> 00:32:02,440
Rym: - Well, yeah, because-- - You're like, the tradition at RIT, when the president resigns, like what the president of RIT is-- At RIT, there was the anime club and the gaming club and the other gaming club, and pretty much every other club was just bupkis.

555
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:10,320
Rym: I mean, the anime club had more members than like 80% of the rest of the clubs combined, and the gaming club was almost up there.

556
00:32:11,183 --> 00:32:12,939
Rym: Like, the geek clubs outnumbered everyone else.

557
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:13,295
Scott: - Yep.

558
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:22,840
Rym: - But the tradition was, when you're retiring, when you're done, when you're passing the reins on to another president, you get a showing that's all yours, you can show whatever anime you want.

559
00:32:23,361 --> 00:32:30,620
Rym: And not only did I show Bayside Shakedown, which is not an anime, it's live action, but I built it up for months.

560
00:32:31,322 --> 00:32:37,399
Rym: I mean, I'd leave hints like it's got an opening song that is also in a DDR game.

561
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:43,080
Scott: - And when you, I remember when you put it in, some guy in the back was like, wait a minute, is this Rhythm and Police?

562
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,854
Rym: - And at that moment, the song comes up and the crowd's like, woo, woo!

563
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:53,160
Rym: And I'm like, yeah, by the way, it's live action.

564
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:53,999
Rym: The crowd's like, what?

565
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,060
Scott: - And then they said, oh shit, it doesn't matter.

566
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,819
Rym: - Yeah, 'cause I pretty much told them, 'cause it was one of the highest, like there were so many people there.

567
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,059
Rym: It was one of the biggest showings ever.

568
00:33:03,421 --> 00:33:05,600
Rym: Not the biggest, no, but one of the biggest.

569
00:33:07,164 --> 00:33:10,420
Rym: And not only, like I warned everyone, this isn't an anime, and they're like, what?

570
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,997
Rym: I was like, I will stake all of my honor and I guarantee that you will all like this, I promise.

571
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,080
Rym: I put everything on the line.

572
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,039
Scott: - And you did not lie.

573
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,860
Rym: - Oh my God, there's a scene at the end of this movie where the crowd is silent, absolutely silent.

574
00:33:26,284 --> 00:33:28,760
Rym: You could hear a pin drop in that room and everyone's like (gasps).

575
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,639
Scott: - That's my favorite part, where they're on top of the building.

576
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,120
Rym: - Yeah, that and the car ride afterward.

577
00:33:35,223 --> 00:33:37,340
Rym: When they're driving away and that sad music's playing.

578
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,539
Scott: - Yeah, it's all right.

579
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:51,679
Rym: - And then when the two big events happened, it was one of the few times in the history of the Anime Club where not only did the crowd cheer and scream, but they jumped up and gave a standing cheer scream applause in the middle of a movie.

580
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:55,020
Rym: Not at the end, in the middle, because one thing happened.

581
00:33:55,141 --> 00:33:56,316
Rym: That's how awesome this is.

582
00:33:57,703 --> 00:34:00,920
Rym: It was so fantastic, that showing.

583
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:08,120
Scott: - Anyway, I learned, to give you a perspective on how great this movie is, I'll give you a fact I learned today from Wikipedia, you ready?

584
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,880
Scott: Oh, two facts from Wikipedia.

585
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:17,940
Scott: Number one fact, this is the fifth best performing film in Japanese box office history.

586
00:34:18,841 --> 00:34:20,639
Scott: Remember, this is Japan we're talking about.

587
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:27,520
Scott: This is competing with Miyazakis and Akira's and all those other live action Japanese movies.

588
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,719
Scott: - Yeah, number-- - This is number five.

589
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:34,340
Scott: There are only four better Japanese movies than this according to Japanese people.

590
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,578
Rym: - Nevermind the fact that the show itself was crazy popular.

591
00:34:38,598 --> 00:34:38,780
Rym: - Yep.

592
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,280
Rym: - And is still crazy popular.

593
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:46,839
Scott: - And after the TV series was off the air, applications to the police force in Japan skyrocketed.

594
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:51,399
Scott: Yeah, so let's give a rundown on the whole thing 'cause it's not just a movie.

595
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,451
Rym: - No, it's in 1997 and '98, there was, I think, whatever.

596
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,720
Scott: - There was a TV series, it was a TV drama.

597
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,439
Rym: - Odoru Daiso Sase.

598
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,399
Scott: - That's what started the whole thing.

599
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:11,499
Rym: - Now it's about a guy, Aoshima, who quits his job to join the police force because he's idealistic, he wants to make Japan a better place.

600
00:35:12,202 --> 00:35:16,460
Rym: So he is working in this made up precinct somewhere, I think it's around Tokyo or in Tokyo.

601
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:20,140
Scott: - Yeah, they make up the fictional Wangen precinct.

602
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,400
Scott: Wangen, whatever, it doesn't matter.

603
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,599
Rym: - And he's idealistic, he's young, he's energetic, he wants to change the world.

604
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,220
Rym: Problem is, the actual police force is no better than his corporate job.

605
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:50,840
Rym: There's full of red tape and bureaucracy, civil servants that don't give a crap, his bosses are more concerned with keeping their jobs and saving face and looking good for the national police than they are actually fighting crime, and his hands are tied behind his back at every turn, a lot of people are incompetent, and it's just, it's a comedy.

606
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,960
Scott: - Yeah, there's a lot of character drama going on, like there's the old detective who's smart and awesome, and there's the girl who's a girl.

607
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,075
Rym: - Yep, and there's Moroi.

608
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:02,399
Scott: - It was Moroi who's the best character, even though he's not the main character.

609
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:21,140
Rym: - To put it in a perspective that would make sense to Americans, imagine if Aoshima, the main character, is like a beat cop on the street, and the old detective is like an old, retired, amazing detective in the US, and Moroi is like an FBI guy who comes in when big things happen, and he can't concern himself with the little stuff.

610
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:29,220
Scott: - Yeah, I think he used to be, I think the story of Moroi is that he was a little guy, but he was so good that he got pushed up into the ranks, and therefore is more awesome.

611
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,280
Rym: - Yeah, see, we haven't actually seen the show, so we can't talk a lot about the backstory.

612
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,700
Scott: - Yeah, we've only seen the two big movies, which is what we're gonna talk mostly about.

613
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:45,620
Rym: - Bayside Shakedown, and then Bayside Shakedown II, Save the Rainbow Bridge, which was basically the exact same movie.

614
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:56,637
Scott: - Yeah, anyway, after the show ended, there were a few special TV episodes, then the two big movies, and then in 2005, there were two spin-off movies, and that's it, that's all there is.

615
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:04,080
Scott: - Yep, for now at least, I mean, it's been, I mean, the last movie-- - It's been two years since they did anything, those spin-off movies, but they might do more.

616
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,820
Rym: - It was two years between the second movie and the spin-off movies.

617
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,119
Scott: - That is true, that is true.

618
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,420
Rym: - And apparently the show still sells really, really well on DVD over there.

619
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:27,600
Scott: - Yeah, there was a DVD box set of the whole show I just saw on the internets on CD Japan, it was a lot of money, and it didn't have subtitles, it was region two box set, but it was really nice, and they said the DVD set came out in 2005, so, you know, hey, not bad.

620
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:54,240
Rym: - But anyway, the pertinent information here is simply that you don't need to have seen any of the show or anything to appreciate the movie, because the movie is standalone, and while all of the character drama is there, and in fact, a lot of character drama from the show comes to a head, but yet they do it well enough to where you know exactly where everyone stands, and you don't know the exact backstory, but you know enough about who likes who, and who's with who, and what's going on, to enjoy it fully.

621
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,969
Scott: - Yeah, so there are some inside jokes that you won't get.

622
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:13,338
Scott: if you watch the movie without seeing the show, such as there's the mascot of the police station, you won't know what the hell it is, but there was a whole episode about it, you just see it there in the movie, but it doesn't actually hurt your enjoyment of the movie, but it can enhance the enjoyment of the movie if you do know.

623
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,279
Rym: - But you can't really get ahold of the show.

624
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,780
Scott: - No, not in English, not easily in English.

625
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,279
Rym: - Yes, the movie, however, you can just get.

626
00:38:19,641 --> 00:38:20,859
Rym: It's in English, on DVD.

627
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:21,369
Rym: - Yep.

628
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,999
Rym: - Get it at any anime con, they always have it.

629
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:33,240
Scott: - You can get it on the internet, it's pure Amazon and eBay, and just make sure you get a DVD with subtitles, we had one, it was at Video Barn, you can get one too, they exist.

630
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,740
Rym: - Yes, they're also torrents periodically, because this movie is super popular.

631
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:40,640
Scott: - Yeah, fifth biggest movie in Japan ever is gonna be a torrent somewhere.

632
00:38:41,320 --> 00:39:05,100
Rym: - Now, I think what makes these movies, well this movie in particular, so amazing, before we get into a lot of the details, is simply that there's drama, and there's serious drama, and there are very, very poignant, amazing action moments, and it's a straight up action-packed thriller, but at the same time, it's a straight up laid back, goofy, pun-riddled, low comedy.

633
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:23,019
Scott: - Yeah, I mean, dramedy is usually a bad word, but this isn't like all the dramedies that, the typical, stereotypical dramedies in the United States, you know, it's more like, it's not like a combination of drama and comedy, it's the two side by side, with not interfering with each other so much.

634
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:38,480
Rym: - Yes, and while the plot, if you actually analyze it from way back, is not the most complex thing in the world, and there are a couple of, effectively, deus ex machinos coming around, the thing is, it's executed to the point that it'll take you along for the ride.

635
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,880
Rym: We kind of mentioned that in Brave Story.

636
00:39:40,261 --> 00:39:45,760
Rym: It's so good, you'll just go along for the ride, accept everything at face value, and it's just awesome.

637
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,820
Scott: - Yeah, a lot of it is kind of silly, like the detectiving, you're not getting the best detectiving action here.

638
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,960
Rym: - It's Phoenix Wright level of detectiving.

639
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,840
Scott: - It's a little better than Phoenix Wright level, but not much better.

640
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:06,359
Rym: - Yeah, but the movie itself, this one specifically, is about, actually, I don't want to ruin anything about this movie, it's really hard to talk about it.

641
00:40:07,564 --> 00:40:08,339
Scott: There's a crime.

642
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,219
Rym: - Yes, well, here's the thing.

643
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:26,953
Rym: The opening scene, I don't want to ruin this, but when we showed the movie, the opening scene happens, and the whole crowd in the anime club was like, wow, I didn't expect a movie to be like this, and the opening scene, the way it gets resolved, is so hilarious.

644
00:40:26,973 --> 00:40:27,500
Scott: - With the golf?

645
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,559
Rym: - And so amazing.

646
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,958
Scott: - Is that the golf one in the car?

647
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,505
Rym: - Yeah.

648
00:40:31,525 --> 00:40:32,051
Scott: - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

649
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,455
Rym: - Yeah.

650
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:34,700
Scott: - Yeah.

651
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:53,920
Scott: - The second movie, actually, the second movie, the second movie is not as good as the first movie, but it's still good, but the opening bit of the second movie with the hostage situation on the boat with the guns is so awesome, oh my god, I think that was like the best scene in both movies combined.

652
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,339
Scott: The beginning of the second movie is the best scene in the whole thing.

653
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:04,080
Rym: - I don't know, I think the die in the air scene and the (snores) scene.

654
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:09,140
Scott: - Those are good ones, but I think the boat was way cool, 'cause it totally fools you right away.

655
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,899
Rym: - It does, 'cause I was thinking, what the fuck?

656
00:41:11,241 --> 00:41:11,580
Rym: What the fuck?

657
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,580
Rym: And I didn't learn my lesson from the first movie.

658
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,394
Rym: - Nope, not at all.

659
00:41:14,414 --> 00:41:14,660
Scott: - At all.

660
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,920
Scott: - I didn't learn it either.

661
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,780
Scott: I'm watching the second movie going, what the fuck's going on here?

662
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,899
Scott: And then all of a sudden it's like, mother, oh, woo!

663
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:26,860
Rym: - It takes a movie, a fucking movie, to fool you twice.

664
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,637
Scott: - Fool me three times.

665
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,173
Rym: - Can't fool me again.

666
00:41:31,193 --> 00:41:31,578
Scott: - Yeah.

667
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:38,480
Rym: - But long story short, a big name, a big shot, an important person gets kidnapped.

668
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:43,060
Rym: And Aoshima is a beat cop, and they wanna solve the crime.

669
00:41:43,642 --> 00:41:50,299
Rym: But at the same time, because it's a big crime, the high up Moroi and all the real cops, like the national awesome cops come in.

670
00:41:50,800 --> 00:42:05,700
Scott: - And a lot of the drama of the movie is the big people at the top of the National Police Department of Japan, all the big time people running the investigation, they are all doing grumbly stuff that's not so good.

671
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:13,279
Scott: And the guys who work on their feet, the actual cops, they know how to get this job done, and there's all sort of conflict between them.

672
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:16,519
Scott: At the same time, they're trying to find the guy who did the crime.

673
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,318
Scott: And aren't there some side crimes also?

674
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,066
Rym: - Yeah, it seems to be.

675
00:42:19,127 --> 00:42:20,080
Rym: both movies were like this.

676
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,820
Rym: There's the main plot crime.

677
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:31,020
Rym: But there are two, or actually I think there are three, pretty much unrelated threads of crime that are going on that they have to deal with independently of the main crime.

678
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:40,640
Scott: - Yeah, usually all of the detective people will be looking to solve the big crime, but each one of them will have some sort of side crime they have to deal with.

679
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,040
Rym: Like what was the one, the-- - Well, there's the crazy woman with the suicide thing.

680
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,540
Scott: - Yeah, there was like a purse snatcher or something?

681
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,120
Scott: What was it?

682
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:53,860
Scott: - Well, there's the-- - That's right, someone was stealing things from the desks of people in the police department.

683
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,819
Rym: - However, that one has a twist ending.

684
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,480
Scott: - That one has a great twist ending.

685
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,020
Scott: It's hilarious.

686
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,419
Scott: I'm not gonna give that away at all.

687
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,400
Rym: - Oh, we can't give anything away.

688
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,559
Rym: This movie is, ugh.

689
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,820
Scott: - That's a big part of this movie is total surprises.

690
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,000
Scott: It's like, huh, there's a mystery.

691
00:43:07,441 --> 00:43:11,920
Scott: And you can kinda get some clues a little bit, but not so much, 'cause it's not a mystery show.

692
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:13,200
Scott: It's a comedy drama.

693
00:43:13,661 --> 00:43:15,599
Scott: So mystery doesn't enter into it so much.

694
00:43:16,661 --> 00:43:19,460
Scott: And then when it kindly resolves, surprise!

695
00:43:19,943 --> 00:43:20,777
Scott: And you go, oh, shits!

696
00:43:21,282 --> 00:43:23,900
Scott: And it's either "Lul" or "Oh My God" or both.

697
00:43:24,481 --> 00:43:31,419
Rym: - Yes, this movie really is a kind of a rollercoaster of build you up and then hit you over the head with an awesome scene.

698
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,779
Rym: And then build you up and hit you over the head with a more awesome scene.

699
00:43:35,281 --> 00:43:37,139
Rym: You'll yell at the screen multiple times.

700
00:43:37,946 --> 00:43:40,460
Scott: And I insist-- with people around.

701
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,480
Scott: 'Cause watching it alone, you don't get the same effect.

702
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,940
Scott: - The more people you have in the room with me-- - Oh, and you gotta turn the music up loud.

703
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:46,457
Scott: - Yes.

704
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,380
Scott: - I think we've just demonstrated that enough.

705
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,279
Rym: - I think we have.

706
00:43:51,121 --> 00:43:55,260
Rym: Now we were talking about the big, national, fancy police versus the low beat police.

707
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:59,900
Rym: And this seems to be a theme or a thread that is present in a lot of Japanese fiction.

708
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:03,879
Rym: Where there's the person on the front lines, the person, like the grunt down there.

709
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:05,999
Rym: And he knows how to get the job done.

710
00:44:06,481 --> 00:44:09,379
Rym: And he has to trust the people above him to make the right decisions.

711
00:44:10,061 --> 00:44:11,239
Rym: And then there's the people at the top.

712
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:17,920
Rym: Who have to, they have to make the right decisions because the things they do directly affect the people on the line.

713
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:21,519
Rym: And they rely on the people on the front lines to do things for them.

714
00:44:21,941 --> 00:44:25,499
Rym: But at the same time, they can't just walk all over those people or nothing will get done.

715
00:44:26,341 --> 00:44:31,796
Rym: And it's this whole kind of, the bond between the low level salary man and the high level CEO.

716
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,820
Rym: And how both of them are required.

717
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,020
Rym: And how you have to have a balance between the two.

718
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:42,919
Rym: And all these sorts of things that are really cool and poignant, but you don't need to worry about them if you don't care because there's also awesome, crazy, funny scenes.

719
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,500
Scott: - It also has a little bit of sanctuary in it.

720
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:54,379
Scott: You know, a sanctuary is all about, I'm in the mafia and you're in the government and we'll work together, you know, me on one side and you on the other side to, you know, set things right.

721
00:44:54,684 --> 00:45:03,220
Scott: There's also-- - In Bayside Shankdown, they have the whole thing of, you know, we're friends, you go up the ladder and I'll stay here on the streets and we'll work together to set things right.

722
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:10,879
Rym: - And there's this really cool plot of like, the friendship between Oshima and Moroi is really strained by this.

723
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:15,579
Rym: Because Moroi has to make decisions based on information that Oshima can't see.

724
00:45:16,181 --> 00:45:21,339
Rym: And Moroi often has to make decisions that are painful or outright suck for reasons that he has no control over.

725
00:45:21,781 --> 00:45:23,300
Rym: But those things still fuck Oshima.

726
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:29,199
Rym: And he has, he trusts Moroi and he has to trust Moroi even when he thinks that Moroi is doing the wrong thing.

727
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,999
Rym: Because his role is the grunt, doing what they say.

728
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:32,492
Scott: - Yep.

729
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:37,160
Rym: - Of course, he's also a troublemaker who never gets any sleep and can never go to the bathroom.

730
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,460
Scott: - Oh yeah, there's all kinds of stuff like that.

731
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:47,900
Rym: - Actually, one of my favorite scenes now that I'm thinking about that thread is remember the scene where-- - The vending machine in the-- - I was about to say the vending machines where-- - I always remember that one.

732
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,299
Scott: I don't know if I like it so much.

733
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:51,640
Scott: It's a good scene, but it's not like my favorite.

734
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,539
Scott: But I always remember it.

735
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,780
Rym: - Well, the fact that the old detective was eavesdropping.

736
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,919
Scott: - Yeah, the old detective, I think, is my favorite character in the whole thing.

737
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:01,259
Rym: - Yeah, I mean, I like Oshima in the same way that I would like Ranma.

738
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,537
Rym: It's just, like, he's the awesome, funny, oh my god.

739
00:46:03,558 --> 00:46:03,759
Rym: guy.

740
00:46:04,202 --> 00:46:05,860
Rym: But all the supporting cast are really good.

741
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:12,900
Scott: - Yeah, the girl actually reminds me, like, Scully from X-Files, only less serious, and Japanese.

742
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:21,880
Rym: - Yeah, we've really avoided talking about the movie in any specific detail, because ruining this movie is a crime.

743
00:46:22,403 --> 00:46:24,800
Rym: I mean, that's like ruining cowboy bebop for someone.

744
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:25,858
Rym: It's just, you can't do it.

745
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:26,639
Rym: That's horrid.

746
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,960
Scott: - The thing is, this is just not very well known outside of Japan, and it's awesome.

747
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:33,460
Rym: - Yes, I can't stress enough.

748
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:37,399
Rym: I know we say this a lot about things, but that's just because we tend to review things we really like.

749
00:46:38,081 --> 00:46:40,560
Rym: I guarantee you will like this movie.

750
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:41,839
Scott: - If you are a human being.

751
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:51,360
Rym: - If you do not like this movie, and you give us a valid reason, an actual valid reason, I mean, we'll probably play your critique on the show.

752
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:59,199
Rym: If you actually give us a good reason why you didn't like this movie, but you'd better be honest, because we'll know if you actually liked it, and you're just lying to get on the show.

753
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,720
Scott: - Yeah, you could be just lying.

754
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:06,180
Rym: - We'll know, because I've never met a human being who did not absolutely love this movie after they saw it.

755
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:19,964
Scott: - Yeah, I think one of the key things about this movie that makes it so great is, here in the United States, right, we have police shows, and the range of police shows seems to be on one end, we've got NYPD, Blue, and CSI, and all these serious, you know,

756
00:47:20,286 --> 00:47:20,790
Rym: police,

757
00:47:21,696 --> 00:47:24,099
Scott: we gotta figure out who did this horrible thing, we found 'em.

758
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,360
Rym: - We found 'em decapitated.

759
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,194
Scott: - It's all dark and gritty, and police procedural.

760
00:47:30,383 --> 00:47:32,479
Scott: And on the other end, we have police academy.

761
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:33,096
Scott: - God.

762
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,139
Scott: - Or naked gun, and crap like that.

763
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,579
Scott: We don't have the in-between in the United States.

764
00:47:39,304 --> 00:47:40,000
Scott: Can you think of one?

765
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:43,480
Rym: - Not really, I can't think of any movie that's at all like this.

766
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:56,700
Scott: - Every police, or detective, or even lawyer, there isn't so much loi-ing in Bayside Shakedown, or Doru Daisousasen, but it seems to either be really serious, or really wacky.

767
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:03,840
Scott: And this is way in between, it's got serious and silly, but not wacky silly, just normal silly.

768
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,979
Scott: And it's awesome, super awesome.

769
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,859
Rym: - Get this movie, watch it.

770
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:14,839
Scott: - Any way you can, if we find a link to somewhere, we should find a link to somewhere you can buy it, and put it in our little thingy.

771
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,559
Rym: - We probably will do that, maybe not right away tonight, but at some point.

772
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:30,959
Scott: - Yeah, so go to frontrowcrew.com, either in the forum, you know what, yeah, in the forums, there will be probably a thread about the episode, and if we find a link to where you can buy it, we'll put all the different links up in there.

773
00:48:31,289 --> 00:48:31,498
Rym: - Yep.

774
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:32,620
Scott: - So go to the forums.

775
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,940
Rym: - And in fact, go to the forums anyway, 'cause the forums have recently exploded more so than ever.

776
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,437
Scott: - Yeah, there's a lot of people talking about a lot of stuff in there.

777
00:48:39,477 --> 00:48:42,720
Scott: now, it's like there's way more action going on than before.

778
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:47,478
Rym: - Yeah, the forums are to the point where I can't even keep up with them anymore, and I admin them.

779
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,499
Scott: - Yeah, so frontrowcrew.com, people.

780
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,970
Rym: - This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

783
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:19,749

784
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:21,849
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

785

Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

786
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:30,389
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights, and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

794

Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
