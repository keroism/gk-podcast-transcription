1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:20,730
Rym: It's Tuesday, November 13th, Dateline November 1st, I'm Rym, I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights Tonight, the Burning Con 2012.

2
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,727
Scott: Let's do this.

3
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,360
Rym: Shows up a little bit late, Scott was too much of a wuss to bike through the hurricane to come over to the studio to do GeekNights.

4
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,900
Scott: Yeah, yeah, listen, you know.

5
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,080
Rym: I was out biking both those days, and running.

6
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,040
Scott: Uh, listen, you have hair warming your head.

7
00:00:37,281 --> 00:00:42,660
Rym: There's things called hats, in fact it's Tuesday, Team Fortress 2 might have taught you about them if you didn't know otherwise.

8
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,764
Scott: Do you own any hats?

9
00:00:43,845 --> 00:00:46,960
Scott: that also, that go underneath helmets in a safe fashion?

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,020
Rym: They make a couple of different kinds of hats that do that.

11
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:50,879
Scott: How much do those cost?

12
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:51,595
Scott: I don't know.

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,372
Scott: Yeah, see, I went to REI.

14
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,180
Scott: You could just not wear a helmet.

15
00:00:55,401 --> 00:00:56,139
Scott: And also EMS.

16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,480
Rym: Just put on a knit hat instead.

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:05,399
Scott: And I was looking at the prices on equipment that would allow me to bike, see I don't want to bike in the snow, even though I looked into that too, you can get studded tires.

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:05,880
Rym: No, it sucks.

19
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:06,560
Rym: It sucks.

20
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,259
Rym: It's not fun.

21
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,659
Rym: Never, ever bike in the snow.

22
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,560
Scott: If you had the right kind of bike.

23
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,519
Rym: No, it's still not fun.

24
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,760
Rym: I've had the right kind of bike.

25
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,240
Rym: It's not fun.

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,660
Scott: I don't want to bike in the rain or snow.

27
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:14,960
Scott: I mean, for no other reason.

28
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,120
Scott: At least I've biked a lot.

29
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,078
Rym: You okay with sleet?

30
00:01:17,902 --> 00:01:19,040
Scott: In any sort of precipitation.

31
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:19,720
Rym: Dark of night?

32
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:20,919
Scott: Especially not hail.

33
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:30,400
Scott: Uh, cause I have biked in the rain, and even though it's perfectly fine in a lot of ways, the mere fact, even if you have a fender, you're gonna get water spraying up on you.

34
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:32,780
Scott: Oh no, you're gonna look like shit when you get wherever you're going.

35
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,100
Scott: Alright, so whatever you're wearing is ruined if you have to bike in the rain.

36
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:44,020
Scott: So, uh, I don't want to do that, but I thought, hey, I do want to bike no matter how cold it is, even if it's like below zero.

37
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:44,940
Rym: So get a nice warm helmet.

38
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,660
Scott: I should be able to bike if it is not raining or snowing or precipitating.

39
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,720
Rym: You could just not wear a helmet.

40
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:51,020
Rym: I often don't wear a helmet.

41
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:51,601
Rym: So

42
00:01:51,742 --> 00:02:02,859
Scott: I went and I looked at the equipment, well, even if you don't wear a helmet, there's still the issue of, you know, the part of your body covered in coats will melt cause you're sweating in it and the part of your body that is exposed will freeze cause there's wind blowing

43
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:02,919
Rym: on.

44
00:02:04,203 --> 00:02:05,740
Rym: You have a really terrible coat.

45
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,139
Scott: You gotta go and get specialized coats that is made for this.

46
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,559
Rym: All the stuff I use for skiing.

47
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,370
Scott: Yeah.

48
00:02:13,221 --> 00:02:20,380
Scott: So I went to REI EMS and investigated the situation to see what kind of equipment I could get that would allow this sort of activity.

49
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,720
Scott: And they had some of that equipment and that equipment was horrendously expensive.

50
00:02:26,463 --> 00:02:28,140
Rym: I don't recall it being that expensive.

51
00:02:28,622 --> 00:02:29,164
Scott: Oh, Mr.

52
00:02:29,224 --> 00:02:33,400
Scott: Vice President doesn't think a five hundred dollar coat is expensive.

53
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,339
Rym: I spent three eighty on my jacket.

54
00:02:37,802 --> 00:02:39,033
Scott: That is more than hundreds.

55
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,960
Rym: That ski jacket is going to last me another 15 hundreds now.

56
00:02:44,502 --> 00:02:46,659
Scott: And that's just the jacket we're talking about.

57
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,760
Rym: We're not even started talking about a jacket that expensive for what you're doing.

58
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,398
Scott: We're talking about the under clothes too.

59
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,820
Scott: Well, remember, this is retail price in Manhattan.

60
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,760
Rym: Get some like stupid Uniqlo Heat Tech T-shirts.

61
00:02:57,841 --> 00:02:59,759
Rym: They work great and they're like 15 bucks.

62
00:03:00,362 --> 00:03:00,704
Scott: Yeah.

63
00:03:00,725 --> 00:03:02,639
Scott: So, you know, I was looking a lot of this stuff.

64
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:09,144
Scott: And to buy enough to wear every day to go to work all the time would add up to many hundreds.

65
00:03:09,506 --> 00:03:11,780
Rym: Or you could just not care and show up to work looking like whatever.

66
00:03:12,302 --> 00:03:15,660
Scott: Or I could just not bike when it's fucking cold out.

67
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,223
Rym: That sucks.

68
00:03:17,693 --> 00:03:18,599
Scott: It doesn't suck too bad.

69
00:03:19,443 --> 00:03:21,079
Scott: Anyway, no frostbite here.

70
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,485
Scott: Pretty good.

71
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:25,080
Rym: The only time pretty good.

72
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:32,057
Rym: Almost got frostbite when I was hiking out in the woods and the blizzard got lost, fell through a creek and my boot broke.

73
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,340
Scott: I'm scoring 100 percent on the no frostbite scale.

74
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:39,120
Rym: OK, but I did go biking yesterday.

75
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:41,399
Rym: But anyway, this episode is a little bit late.

76
00:03:41,843 --> 00:03:43,437
Rym: As I said, Dateline November 1st.

77
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,300
Rym: But we missed Tuesday's show due to various reasons we just discussed.

78
00:03:48,841 --> 00:03:53,445
Rym: So this isn't actually going up for all a week and a half from when we're recording this.

79
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:54,056
Scott: Oh, well.

80
00:03:54,682 --> 00:03:59,419
Rym: So Tuesday, I heard a game came out, heard a couple of games came out.

81
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:00,140
Scott: Yeah.

82
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:04,280
Scott: After waiting for over a decade, perhaps.

83
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:04,963
Scott: Yes.

84
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:08,302
Scott: Longer than longer than the Team Fortress 2.

85
00:04:08,302 --> 00:04:10,840
Rym: I waited longer for Team Fortress 2.

86
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:20,480
Scott: Well, we haven't really, you know, I've been waiting so long because this one is, you know, unlike, say, Duke Nukem Forever, Duke Nukem Forever, it would be like there'd be some screenshots and there'd be nothing.

87
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,760
Scott: There'd be E3, there'd be nothing.

88
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:27,919
Scott: And then it kept coming and disappearing, coming and disappearing and appearing and reappearing and then disappearing for long periods of time.

89
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:40,863
Scott: This game has appeared and stayed, appeared without disappearing, you know, with with relatively frequent, you know, news updates and no black holes or mysteries for about a decade.

90
00:04:42,153 --> 00:04:43,100
Scott: And now it is out.

91
00:04:43,522 --> 00:04:46,500
Rym: I have the fancy black armor because I gave them forty dollars.

92
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:49,300
Scott: It is 100 percent out natural selection, too.

93
00:04:49,582 --> 00:04:51,359
Scott: And actually, I haven't played it in months.

94
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:52,786
Rym: Neither have I.

95
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:54,639
Scott: Yeah, but I want to.

96
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,040
Scott: But I'm busy on other things.

97
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,260
Rym: I haven't even played Counter-Strike.

98
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,288
Scott: Me either.

99
00:04:59,308 --> 00:05:00,139
Rym: I wonder why.

100
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:01,479
Rym: We'll talk about it in weeks.

101
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,260
Rym: We'll talk in the meta why that is.

102
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,418
Rym: But yeah, we haven't played NS2.

103
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,082
Rym: But you know what?

104
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,337
Rym: Every time I played it had been a market improvement.

105
00:05:08,397 --> 00:05:09,826
Rym: over the previous time I'd played it.

106
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:11,820
Scott: Now it has like mechs and shit.

107
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
Scott: And wow, man, it's off the hook.

108
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,680
Scott: It was several months ago and apparently all kinds of network issues are fixed.

109
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:22,497
Rym: It reached the point where it was actually at that point more fun than the original NS, which took a while to get to.

110
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:23,982
Rym: I don't know.

111
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:25,569
Scott: Well, it was.

112
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,919
Scott: it was equal ish, different but equal ish.

113
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,522
Rym: Yeah, different.

114
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:31,780
Rym: But it was more fun to play, partly just because a lot more people.

115
00:05:32,243 --> 00:05:33,720
Rym: It was easier to get a game going.

116
00:05:34,062 --> 00:05:35,060
Rym: There's other factors there.

117
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,580
Rym: I mean, I'd still be playing weapons factory, but you know what?

118
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,084
Rym: There's no goddamn way to play weapons factory, except with nut jobs who were so much better than me.

119
00:05:42,105 --> 00:05:42,838
Rym: It wouldn't even matter.

120
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:46,360
Rym: Be like if chess were a forgotten art and I wanted to play.

121
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:57,744
Scott: Well, only the hardcore crazy dude, if everyone else, if everyone else on Earth forgot chess, but me, I could be the best because I'd still remember the rules and I played it more times.

122
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,740
Rym: And that might not actually be to your advantage.

123
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,379
Rym: And to you and I should play Bobby Fischer chess because that eliminates all opening study as a factor.

124
00:06:08,002 --> 00:06:11,016
Rym: You know, Bobby Fischer chess, that's how you know what it's in that book.

125
00:06:11,056 --> 00:06:12,424
Rym: that wouldn't matter what you should be.

126
00:06:12,464 --> 00:06:16,006
Scott: that wouldn't matter to me because I've never learned any of the chess openings.

127
00:06:16,207 --> 00:06:18,340
Rym: I have learned three to a reasonable degree.

128
00:06:18,822 --> 00:06:25,780
Rym: I am partial to the Polish opening, but everyone good I've ever played with told me I'm stupid for using it and I don't understand it well enough to understand why.

129
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,999
Rym: But yeah, do you know what Bobby Fischer chess is?

130
00:06:31,162 --> 00:06:32,619
Scott: It's something where you shuffle up all the pieces.

131
00:06:33,202 --> 00:06:35,495
Rym: No, you shuffle the back row only.

132
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,200
Rym: So that row is just randomized and equivalent on both sides.

133
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,120
Scott: Well, shuffling up the front row wouldn't really do much.

134
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,420
Rym: But you can shuffle up everything.

135
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,719
Rym: So maybe there's a pawn in the back.

136
00:06:45,122 --> 00:06:51,039
Scott: We kind of I'd like that, but then upon would not be able to do shit if it was caught behind the scenes, can barely do shit in the front.

137
00:06:52,361 --> 00:06:59,320
Rym: I've also realized that most people I've known in my life, like everyone who's a gamer, seems to know the rules of chess and that they know how the pieces move.

138
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:03,501
Rym: But I'm starting to realize that most people I know don't actually know all the rules of chess.

139
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:07,100
Rym: They cannot describe how castling works, nor have they ever heard of all.

140
00:07:07,621 --> 00:07:16,857
Scott: If they're OK, so castling is when the rook and the the king, right, are sort of don't have anything in between them.

141
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:17,722
Scott: Right.

142
00:07:17,883 --> 00:07:18,083
Scott: Yeah.

143
00:07:18,184 --> 00:07:25,159
Scott: In which case, then you move the rook two spaces to the right and then you move the king to the other side of the rook, like jumps over him.

144
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:25,804
Rym: All right.

145
00:07:25,825 --> 00:07:26,375
Rym: Here's the trick.

146
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:26,620
Scott: That's it.

147
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:27,579
Scott: That's all the castle is.

148
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:32,939
Rym: Can you castle if the rook had moved out of that position and later returned to it?

149
00:07:34,503 --> 00:07:36,056
Scott: I have no idea, but I will guess no.

150
00:07:37,062 --> 00:07:41,000
Rym: So more important, not more important because it never happens, but more crazy.

151
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,780
Scott: Can you castle if the king moved out of the position to move back into it?

152
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,020
Rym: I'm looking up because I actually remember.

153
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:45,801
Scott: Right.

154
00:07:45,822 --> 00:07:48,514
Rym: But the thing is, castling never comes up among.

155
00:07:49,238 --> 00:07:49,680
Rym: it's weird.

156
00:07:50,202 --> 00:07:52,260
Scott: Like, do you really do pros ever castle?

157
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,480
Rym: So from what I gather, yes.

158
00:07:53,560 --> 00:08:02,881
Rym: What I've noticed and I read an article about this, really inexperienced players castle way more often than anyone, because if they know about the rule existing, you got to try it.

159
00:08:02,902 --> 00:08:04,559
Rym: They go for it because it seems cool.

160
00:08:05,024 --> 00:08:06,379
Scott: Of course, wouldn't you?

161
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,240
Scott: That's the reason that you buy all the weird buildings in Calus.

162
00:08:10,382 --> 00:08:14,171
Rym: But en passant is the rule that I think most people who play chess in the world have never heard of.

163
00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:20,039
Scott: Isn't that the one where like all the pawns are lined up against each other so you can kill the pawn in a weird way?

164
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:29,991
Rym: It has to do with the fact that way back in the day, you know, there's no original rules of chess, really, but basically there was no move upon two spaces at the beginning of the game rule.

165
00:08:30,216 --> 00:08:30,420
Rym: Right.

166
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,445
Rym: So the game took longer.

167
00:08:31,746 --> 00:08:36,599
Rym: So eventually this was kind of a house rule where you could say, all right, you can move upon forward twice.

168
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,280
Rym: But again, around the fact that that could actually change the game.

169
00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:52,239
Rym: If upon moved to and there was another pawn like in front of it, it can move at an angle to where the pawn would have been if that rule weren't in place and capture it like that instead of landing directly on it.

170
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:53,904
Rym: That's it.

171
00:08:54,286 --> 00:08:56,420
Rym: I don't think that comes up much in professional play, if at all.

172
00:08:57,123 --> 00:08:59,159
Scott: I don't know anything about really professional chess.

173
00:08:59,381 --> 00:09:00,780
Scott: Oh, I don't know the opening.

174
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:06,681
Rym: I'm pretty shit at chess, partly because I studied those openings, but I don't really play.

175
00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:09,700
Scott: I recall like the few very few times you played chess.

176
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,459
Scott: I've actually won despite not knowing anything except the rules and how to move guys.

177
00:09:15,062 --> 00:09:19,500
Rym: Ah, castling is important goal in early parts of chess, according to Wikipedia.

178
00:09:20,582 --> 00:09:20,623
Scott: OK.

179
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:22,620
Rym: Good.

180
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,181
Rym: OK.

181
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:26,475
Rym: Anyway, so another game is to do you shave.

182
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,960
Scott: You really haven't bought it already.

183
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,499
Scott: I don't know what the hell is wrong with you or what podcast you've been listening to.

184
00:09:32,601 --> 00:09:34,367
Scott: But really, we're talking.

185
00:09:34,387 --> 00:09:39,158
Scott: if you're the kind of person who is dying in Counter-Strike all the time, maybe you don't like it.

186
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,340
Scott: I mean, really, you know, and sometimes you're not in the Counter-Strike mood.

187
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,900
Scott: Sometimes you need something a little different.

188
00:09:44,721 --> 00:09:52,120
Scott: You should really have Counter-Strike go and NS2 and that will pretty much satisfy all of your multiplayer team based FPS needs for the rest of your life.

189
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:58,540
Rym: There was a time in my life when I would play Counter-Strike until I was sick of it and then I would just immediately play NS until I was sick of it.

190
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,400
Scott: And go back to Counter-Strike.

191
00:09:59,660 --> 00:09:59,983
Scott: Pretty much.

192
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:00,306
Scott: Right.

193
00:10:00,347 --> 00:10:01,660
Scott: So just have those two games.

194
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,479
Scott: If you have any two games on Steam, have those two.

195
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:13,260
Scott: And really, dude, I mean, you could almost argue you don't need any other games except maybe Super Metroid and Mega Man 2.

196
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,820
Scott: Yeah, but you don't really need FTL, but it's good.

197
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:17,009
Rym: I need FTL.

198
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,738
Rym: I really like FTL.

199
00:10:18,522 --> 00:10:21,200
Rym: I look forward to some sort of expansion or versus version.

200
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,803
Scott: Well, let's just say this a year from now, FTL play not going to get so many hours a year from now.

201
00:10:27,306 --> 00:10:29,439
Scott: And as to in Counter-Strike, still going to get clicked on.

202
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,640
Rym: But they're different classes of game entirely.

203
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:34,894
Rym: I'm just saying these games have their own like these are.

204
00:10:34,915 --> 00:10:36,120
Scott: these are life games.

205
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,940
Scott: These aren't those games where you buy them, play them and put them away.

206
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,400
Scott: These are life games.

207
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,366
Scott: There's only two of them.

208
00:10:42,354 --> 00:10:43,220
Scott: One of them just came out.

209
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:43,843
Scott: This is a big deal.

210
00:10:44,004 --> 00:10:47,441
Rym: Castling is permissible if and only if the following conditions still hold.

211
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:47,944
Rym: Here we go.

212
00:10:48,145 --> 00:10:52,920
Rym: One, the king has not previously moved up to the chosen rock has not previously moved up.

213
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,686
Rym: So, yeah, that's that.

214
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:54,595
Rym: I guess so.

215
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,643
Scott: I guessed right.

216
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:59,939
Rym: Three, there are no pieces between the king and the chosen rock for the king is not currently in check.

217
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,560
Rym: Five, the king does not pass through a square that is under attack.

218
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,320
Scott: You can't do it when you're in check.

219
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:04,641
Rym: No.

220
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,619
Scott: Oh, but that's like the best time when you'd want to do it.

221
00:11:08,304 --> 00:11:09,620
Scott: Yeah, it's bullshit.

222
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,600
Rym: The king does not pass through a square that is under attack by enemy pieces.

223
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:18,160
Rym: Six, the king does not end up in does not pass through a square that is under attack.

224
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:24,503
Scott: So if one of the spaces between the king and the rook could be hit by, say, a knight, you can't castle.

225
00:11:25,246 --> 00:11:25,708
Rym: Oh, it's.

226
00:11:25,748 --> 00:11:28,864
Rym: that's very similar to the opposite rule that it prevents you from.

227
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:30,800
Rym: you know, you get this extra move to speed up the game.

228
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,140
Scott: But what are these rules of chess?

229
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,580
Scott: I didn't know that are bullshit.

230
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:36,460
Rym: Six, the king does not end up in check, which I guess is a rule.

231
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,999
Scott: That would be funny if you did that.

232
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:38,980
Scott: You're fucking stupid.

233
00:11:39,442 --> 00:11:40,580
Scott: OK, go seven.

234
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,319
Rym: The king and the chosen rook are on the same rank.

235
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:46,428
Scott: Wait a minute.

236
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:47,578
Scott: So you can.

237
00:11:47,922 --> 00:11:49,139
Scott: What do you mean on the same rank?

238
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,082
Rym: The row.

239
00:11:51,865 --> 00:11:54,375
Scott: So you can actually move them both forward and then do it.

240
00:11:55,841 --> 00:12:00,819
Scott: I don't understand that part, because then they would have moved, which would have invalidated the first thing.

241
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:01,842
Scott: Right.

242
00:12:01,863 --> 00:12:06,415
Scott: I mean, you can only do it in the back row from their starting positions when neither of them have moved.

243
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:06,699
Scott: Right.

244
00:12:07,523 --> 00:12:09,439
Scott: So how could they not be on the same rank?

245
00:12:11,282 --> 00:12:15,220
Scott: I don't know, actually, that's a really that's a redundant rule.

246
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:16,459
Rym: Here's a handbook.

247
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:19,999
Scott: A handbook all about just castling, and that's it?

248
00:12:20,481 --> 00:12:26,140
Rym: I will continue to investigate this later, because the point I was making wasn't that I'm so smart and everyone else doesn't know chess.

249
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,039
Scott: Well, you're clearly not that smart if you had to read Wikipedia to know this.

250
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,540
Scott: But I'm saying that you're no smarter than me.

251
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,437
Rym: Gamer nerds, I found, don't actually know chess.

252
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:33,840
Rym: that well.

253
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,724
Rym: And it's not.

254
00:12:35,428 --> 00:12:37,380
Rym: chess is not popular among gamers.

255
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,340
Rym: And people who like chess do not like other games.

256
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:49,040
Scott: It's because there is a chess community and in fact, the Go community sort of also to some extent doesn't cross over with the rest of the gaming community.

257
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,800
Scott: It's like the gaming community is super inclusive.

258
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,239
Scott: We'll have you chess people, we'll have you go people, but they don't want us.

259
00:12:55,204 --> 00:12:56,339
Scott: They don't want to hang out with us.

260
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:03,360
Scott: Puerto Rico players and us, you know, power grid players, they just want to stay all by themselves like their game is its own thing.

261
00:13:04,302 --> 00:13:09,260
Scott: And I guess by having their game be its own thing, does it make them feel so how their game is above all other?

262
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:16,020
Rym: So this is a roundabout way of once again recommending Richard Garfield's book because he talks about that and he equates chess to Counter-Strike in this regard.

263
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,100
Rym: And he makes some very good points.

264
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,200
Rym: I finished chapter one.

265
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,019
Scott: I'm in chapter two.

266
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:27,160
Scott: I read the whole section about heuristics just recently.

267
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:30,240
Rym: Isn't that the directional heuristics versus positional heuristics?

268
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:38,250
Scott: No, just how gamers use heuristics and how nubs can't really figure out any, you know, especially in a game.

269
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:38,980
Scott: No one gives a bad.

270
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:48,480
Rym: So we have terms for this, but basically his terms are a directional heuristic is a heuristic you have that tells you or helps you decide what move to make.

271
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,519
Scott: That's the ones I use most often.

272
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,799
Rym: And a positional heuristic tells you who's winning.

273
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,460
Rym: That's the part that everyone who plays games with me fucks up.

274
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,446
Rym: They think that because they're in the front in Mario Kart, that they're somehow in first place.

275
00:14:00,487 --> 00:14:00,752
Rym: Right.

276
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:01,220
Scott: Yeah.

277
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:07,053
Scott: The directional heuristic is in power grid when I'm counting how much money I can bid on power plant.

278
00:14:07,256 --> 00:14:07,520
Scott: Yeah.

279
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,059
Scott: How much I have to save for the reason.

280
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,849
Rym: Meanwhile, the positional heuristic is, well, am I going to be in first or last and who's actually winning?

281
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:14,819
Rym: Watch out for Rym.

282
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,543
Scott: Watch out for him.

283
00:14:18,474 --> 00:14:19,439
Scott: That's the only one you need.

284
00:14:19,701 --> 00:14:22,259
Rym: So many of our friends were from games.

285
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,163
Rym: And, you know, we talked about this before, but Guns of Icarus online actually finally came out.

286
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,559
Scott: Why so many games come out?

287
00:14:29,941 --> 00:14:31,200
Scott: Who has money or time?

288
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,480
Rym: And I've been working from home all week because of the hurricane.

289
00:14:35,181 --> 00:14:37,100
Rym: So I've been playing a bunch of these games.

290
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,360
Rym: I got to say, I played Guns of Icarus a bunch during the beta.

291
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,122
Rym: It was pretty fun.

292
00:14:40,604 --> 00:14:46,027
Rym: It's like to imagine two on two like ships versus and your man and guns and run around like each team.

293
00:14:46,107 --> 00:14:48,320
Rym: It's ship has a captain and you can target.

294
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,370
Scott: But there's no boarding.

295
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:50,320
Scott: You can't board the other.

296
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,260
Rym: Wait, I heard there was going to be boarding.

297
00:14:52,421 --> 00:14:53,063
Scott: No, there's not.

298
00:14:53,103 --> 00:14:59,500
Rym: In fact, I heard I heard a very, very credible rumor that there will, in fact, be boarding and Guns of Icarus online.

299
00:15:00,222 --> 00:15:03,460
Rym: I have a reliable source to be that hard is Emily's yelling.

300
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:04,679
Rym: Fuck you from the other room.

301
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,816
Scott: I don't know why it wouldn't be that hard to do would I think?

302
00:15:07,877 --> 00:15:08,400
Rym: I know why.

303
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,650
Scott: Do you know why you got to work?

304
00:15:09,851 --> 00:15:10,699
Scott: No, no, no.

305
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,490
Rym: It's so easy.

306
00:15:11,531 --> 00:15:12,099
Rym: No, it's not.

307
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:12,662
Scott: All you got to do.

308
00:15:12,682 --> 00:15:16,780
Scott: I mean, every FPS in the world, you jump from one platform to another.

309
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,586
Scott: This ship is a no.

310
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,140
Rym: It's not the game part of it.

311
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:19,768
Rym: That's the problem.

312
00:15:19,828 --> 00:15:20,700
Scott: Ship is a platform.

313
00:15:20,821 --> 00:15:21,850
Scott: You jump now.

314
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:23,040
Scott: You just press spacebar.

315
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:23,642
Scott: He jumps.

316
00:15:24,065 --> 00:15:27,040
Scott: If there's another ship under your feet when you land, then you are.

317
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,290
Rym: Have you ever written anything?

318
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,480
Rym: Have you ever done anything in unity?

319
00:15:30,182 --> 00:15:30,403
Scott: No.

320
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:36,279
Rym: So it's highly likely that player entities are tied to ship entities or something like that or two teams.

321
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:40,440
Rym: So they're not independent objects that can interact completely independently.

322
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,360
Scott: It's not just a floating platform.

323
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:48,022
Scott: No, because it sounds like somebody didn't think about that in the beginning or they did.

324
00:15:48,142 --> 00:15:55,200
Rym: I would make a secondary argument that from a play perspective, how many games do you play that at a first person perspective in melee combat?

325
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,400
Scott: Who says has to be melee combat?

326
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,245
Rym: All right.

327
00:15:58,305 --> 00:16:00,759
Rym: So I jump onto the enemy ship and there's a dude there.

328
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:02,158
Scott: We can shoot him.

329
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:03,342
Rym: OK.

330
00:16:03,884 --> 00:16:11,739
Scott: In a world, the most basic thing in a first person shooter, you have a gun and you're pointing at someone and you go bang, the simplest possible thing.

331
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:14,820
Rym: But it's a world where not everybody has these handheld guns.

332
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,559
Rym: As far as I can tell, the only guns are giant ship mounted guns.

333
00:16:18,641 --> 00:16:19,284
Scott: Maybe they should.

334
00:16:19,385 --> 00:16:22,420
Scott: It's not that hard to add a handgun to an FPS.

335
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:26,439
Scott: That is the most baby FPS tutorial thing to do.

336
00:16:27,102 --> 00:16:31,160
Rym: But it messes up the kind of rhythm of the game because that is a serious problem.

337
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,428
Rym: Think about what happens.

338
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,900
Scott: That is a very serious problem.

339
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,029
Scott: One guy's on your ship.

340
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:36,259
Scott: You're trying to fly it.

341
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,980
Scott: Meanwhile, he's really good at FPS.

342
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,599
Scott: No, I mean, it goes around your ship killing you all the time.

343
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,028
Rym: Exactly.

344
00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:41,360
Rym: I was ready.

345
00:16:41,823 --> 00:16:43,499
Scott: You respawn on this flying boat.

346
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,838
Scott: Do you respawn on it?

347
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,520
Scott: So I was going to just steal your boat.

348
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,242
Scott: Can he pile?

349
00:16:48,262 --> 00:16:53,976
Scott: Can he use the guns on your boat to shoot at your, you know, in disguise to shoot at the friendly boat?

350
00:16:54,602 --> 00:16:59,660
Scott: Them thinking it's a friend, but really it's a bad guy got on there and killed everybody from boarding.

351
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:10,819
Scott: So what this basically comes down to is we did that lecture and then there'll be no reason to use the big boats because someone would just steal them with their skills and jump off the tiny boat and just board the big.

352
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,190
Rym: So, Scott, maybe you get around that by doing a Team Fortress 2 thing and gimping the FPS part, but then it's not nearly as fun as people like.

353
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:22,380
Scott: there is a huge game, completely broken flaw if you allow the boarding.

354
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:36,099
Rym: So what I'm getting at is that we talked about that concept of like in mega, mega, mega factory, mega TF or weapons factory, how one asshole who's just better at head clicking than everyone else literally can dominate an entire team.

355
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,464
Scott: Indeed.

356
00:17:37,484 --> 00:17:40,620
Rym: So you're going to get to a chapter that talks about the same thing.

357
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,020
Rym: It's like factors of play.

358
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:46,440
Rym: So like if I'm playing Puerto Rico, actually, he used some other game as an example.

359
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,389
Rym: Hearts was the example.

360
00:17:47,713 --> 00:17:48,077
Rym: He's like one.

361
00:17:48,480 --> 00:18:02,047
Rym: If I use zero factors or zero heuristics, I'm playing randomly, if I use one heuristic paying attention to how many hearts are in my hand, suddenly I have a much higher chance of winning.

362
00:18:02,555 --> 00:18:02,920
Scott: Really?

363
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:08,359
Rym: Say I use another additional heuristic paying attention to whether or not the Queen of Spades have been played yet.

364
00:18:08,862 --> 00:18:11,720
Rym: That's another huge advantage for relatively little effort.

365
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,040
Rym: Let's say now also I use a third one.

366
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,920
Rym: I also keep track of the king and ace of spades.

367
00:18:16,422 --> 00:18:21,360
Rym: Not as much of a return, not as common to pay out, but gives me a higher chance of winning, just less of one.

368
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,299
Scott: Well, I pay attention to them if I fucking have them.

369
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,219
Scott: So get rid of their asses.

370
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,920
Rym: So as you keep applying, what if I start counting cards like count the number of hearts played by anyone, count the number of points taken by anyone.

371
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:40,420
Rym: Every factor I add, every like thing or skill I use takes additional effort and gives me an additional chance of winning.

372
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,460
Rym: But there is a diminishing return.

373
00:18:42,942 --> 00:18:47,298
Scott: What if you're playing hearts and you have the queen, king and ace of spades all in your hand all at once?

374
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,100
Rym: Ah, usually if that's the case, it depends.

375
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,420
Rym: Do I have any other spades in my hand?

376
00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:57,080
Scott: Well, the only really hope you have is if you can get rid of another suit very quickly and then play all three of those.

377
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,440
Rym: See, this is we think we think about hearts on very different levels.

378
00:18:59,863 --> 00:19:01,300
Rym: I have two questions in that situation.

379
00:19:01,601 --> 00:19:03,080
Rym: One, do I have three questions?

380
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,320
Rym: One, do I have any other spades?

381
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,222
Rym: And if so, how many?

382
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:11,559
Rym: Two, is the person I am giving cards to an idiot or not?

383
00:19:12,381 --> 00:19:17,240
Rym: And three, am I low on a suit that is not spades or hearts?

384
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,780
Scott: Yeah, if you're low on a suit that's not spades, you can just play.

385
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,999
Scott: You can just empty your hand of that suit and then hope someone else plays that suit, allowing you to dump all there.

386
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,600
Rym: Now, I would not do that if I had the queen and a small number of spades.

387
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,960
Scott: Well, you only really need to not have the ace in the game.

388
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,620
Scott: You only need to dump the queen.

389
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,800
Scott: You can dump the other ones later.

390
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,402
Rym: No, no, no.

391
00:19:35,422 --> 00:19:40,200
Rym: The thing is, if I have the queen having the ace is great and the king is great.

392
00:19:40,301 --> 00:19:40,744
Rym: You know why?

393
00:19:40,765 --> 00:19:42,095
Rym: Shooting moons?

394
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:44,451
Rym: No.

395
00:19:44,492 --> 00:19:45,380
Rym: I rarely shoot the moon.

396
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:54,100
Scott: I'm just saying it'd be really easy to shoot the moon because, you know, when you play the queen, there's no chance of someone else being forced to take it by, you know, having the king or ace be the only card remaining in their hand.

397
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,737
Rym: I would disagree because usually I don't shoot the moon that early.

398
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,210
Rym: By the time it's at the point where someone gives me the queen, it's usually not apparent that I'm shooting the moon yet.

399
00:20:02,251 --> 00:20:03,240
Rym: It just looks like I'm sucking.

400
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:19,837
Rym: But no, it's because if I have the king and the ace or at least one of them and someone else is trying to force me to queen myself by playing low spades, I can take the trick with the ace or king, maybe take a hard if I'm forced to, and then

401
00:20:19,878 --> 00:20:20,802
Scott: switch it up to something

402
00:20:20,842 --> 00:20:23,360
Rym: and leave with something else and delay the inevitable fucking that I'm about

403
00:20:24,607 --> 00:20:25,271
Scott: to get.

404
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:26,880
Scott: But you're only delaying the inevitable.

405
00:20:27,283 --> 00:20:27,992
Scott: You're going to get 13 points.

406
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:34,765
Rym: Well, this comes down to an interesting quirk of game theory among a wide spread of players.

407
00:20:35,008 --> 00:20:36,000
Rym: Stuff like that works really well.

408
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,960
Rym: If I just play perfectly optimally and conservatively, there's a chance other people will fuck up and I'm very likely to win.

409
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,828
Scott: I always play hard.

410
00:20:41,848 --> 00:20:42,880
Scott: It's 100 percent conservative.

411
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,120
Rym: If four skilled players play hard conservatively, it's random.

412
00:20:47,482 --> 00:20:51,540
Rym: So instead, you can only augment your chance of winning by playing aggressively.

413
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:57,103
Scott: The original point with the boarding was simply that this is another case of the counter strike.

414
00:20:57,485 --> 00:20:58,694
Scott: Everyone says remove the AWP.

415
00:21:00,162 --> 00:21:01,400
Scott: Everyone says add boarding.

416
00:21:01,981 --> 00:21:02,667
Scott: Don't do it.

417
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:03,979
Scott: You'll mess the game up like tribes do.

418
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,259
Rym: Yo, dogs, game design, wah, complicated deaths.

419
00:21:07,764 --> 00:21:08,158
Scott: That's right.

420
00:21:13,532 --> 00:21:15,790
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

421
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:22,650
Rym: So in gaming, as you all know, especially people who played games with me before, I'm a huge fan of the trash talking.

422
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:34,943
Rym: No, I mean, back at RIT, we used to always do the trash talk Mario Tennis Tournament where you were obligated to trash talk the other team while you played and you were graded on your trash talking independently of the tennis match

423
00:21:35,023 --> 00:21:37,213
Scott: is one that is the best trash talk.

424
00:21:37,233 --> 00:21:42,753
Rym: Trash talking is also a difficult subject because, for example, that is the poo noise.

425
00:21:42,854 --> 00:21:44,930
Rym: Some people enjoy trash, the noise of victory.

426
00:21:45,491 --> 00:21:54,230
Rym: But if there is someone who can't deal with trash talk in your group and they want to play a game, if you trash talk, don't be friends with them, you make them feel bad.

427
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,133
Scott: Don't be friends with them.

428
00:21:55,254 --> 00:21:59,312
Rym: If you don't trash talk them, you make them feel equally bad.

429
00:21:59,332 --> 00:22:04,110
Rym: But anyway, this is a video of what can happen.

430
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:10,529
Rym: You see, there are two important kinds of trash talk backed up and not backed up or pre hoc and post.

431
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,770
Scott: Those are the same kind.

432
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:15,269
Rym: I am a fan of the post hoc trash talk that is rims.

433
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:20,070
Rym: I will be very quiet during the game until my victory is assured.

434
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:24,250
Rym: And the more likely it is that I'm going to win, the more I ramp it the fuck up.

435
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,250
Scott: See, I'm the pre hoc nature.

436
00:22:26,492 --> 00:22:26,775
Scott: Right.

437
00:22:27,018 --> 00:22:28,129
Scott: And that is the pre hoc.

438
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,650
Scott: See, I view post hoc trash talk is sort of invalid trash talk.

439
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,410
Scott: It's like you've already won and now you're talking shit.

440
00:22:34,711 --> 00:22:37,370
Scott: Oh, you're so brave to talk shit after you.

441
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:41,130
Scott: It's like you beat your ass and you beat a guy up.

442
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,090
Scott: He's bleeding on the floor and then you start talking.

443
00:22:43,451 --> 00:22:45,549
Scott: It's like what kind of what kind of pussy are you?

444
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:45,871
Scott: Right.

445
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:59,150
Scott: A real man, someone who is, you know, and I don't mean the gender man and just mean someone who is who is brave and awesome at gaming will trash talk and hype themselves up before the challenge.

446
00:22:59,472 --> 00:23:01,990
Scott: That is to say, I'm about to kick your ass.

447
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,267
Scott: Yeah, I can take you.

448
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,579
Rym: See, here's the problem.

449
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:05,970
Rym: You use the pre hoc too much.

450
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:14,110
Scott: So when you because if sometimes I go in sometimes I go in with the pre hoc and say, bring it, and then they bring it and I get my ass kicked.

451
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:18,470
Rym: See, if I trash talk after the fact and I lost, well, that just means I'm stupid.

452
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:26,290
Rym: But if I trash talk before and I lose, I have lost doubly, which is why my pre hoc trash talk is very rare.

453
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:30,871
Rym: But when I bring it, usually all I do is I just do the Babe Ruth point right before the game.

454
00:23:31,715 --> 00:23:34,930
Scott: See, the thing is, I win more often than not.

455
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:41,253
Scott: So except that's not true pre hoc talking like the pre hoc talking I just did one sentence.

456
00:23:41,354 --> 00:23:43,170
Rym: I will be I'm Babe Ruth thing.

457
00:23:43,311 --> 00:23:47,890
Rym: I will beat you in the next competitive ortho game that you and I play together.

458
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,290
Scott: Whoever's name is Scott wins.

459
00:23:51,335 --> 00:23:52,350
Rym: I didn't agree to play that game.

460
00:23:52,411 --> 00:23:53,024
Rym: It doesn't matter.

461
00:23:53,044 --> 00:23:53,187
Scott: I won.

462
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,850
Rym: I will win the next ortho game that you and I play.

463
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:56,511
Scott: Sure.

464
00:23:56,531 --> 00:23:59,369
Rym: Did you get to the part of the book where he says what an ortho game is?

465
00:23:59,953 --> 00:24:00,035
Rym: OK.

466
00:24:00,055 --> 00:24:00,562
Rym: Chapter one.

467
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:01,615
Scott: I told you.

468
00:24:02,201 --> 00:24:02,990
Rym: I forget where that is.

469
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,069
Rym: It was a while ago when I read it.

470
00:24:05,031 --> 00:24:13,050
Scott: So how does this trash talk discussion relate to a video from a fight as in people punching each other and it won't do which fighting sport is it?

471
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:13,875
Scott: Is it boxing?

472
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,989
Scott: Is it punk craze?

473
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:16,876
Scott: Is it what is it?

474
00:24:17,178 --> 00:24:18,308
Rym: It's boxing esque.

475
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:28,910
Rym: OK, but basically one dude is way cocky and the other guy punches him a whole bunch and he basically just doesn't even defend himself and walks over like, what, what, what?

476
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:29,938
Rym: Bring it, bring it.

477
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:30,890
Rym: And the other guy brings it.

478
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:31,554
Rym: And that's the end.

479
00:24:31,574 --> 00:24:32,320
Rym: Yeah, it's.

480
00:24:32,843 --> 00:24:33,810
Rym: it's a beautiful thing.

481
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:34,894
Rym: To behold.

482
00:24:35,235 --> 00:24:38,249
Rym: And it has the tags, ouch, fail, fights, fighting and cocky.

483
00:24:38,731 --> 00:24:40,410
Scott: OK, so check this out.

484
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:45,690
Scott: There's a game coming out called Apotheon or Apotheon or whatever.

485
00:24:46,190 --> 00:25:00,010
Scott: And this game, from all intents and purposes in the video that you look at here, seems to be a completely average platforming combat ish kind of game where you jump and throw spears and block things with a shield and that sort of thing.

486
00:25:00,912 --> 00:25:03,069
Scott: Not too much exciting is going on here.

487
00:25:03,737 --> 00:25:04,648
Scott: 2D platformer.

488
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:09,813
Scott: It seems like it's going to be on Steam on Windows and then maybe other platforms later, whatever.

489
00:25:10,455 --> 00:25:26,050
Scott: But the stylings, the visual aesthetic stylings of this game are looking like one of my favorite stylings, the ancient Greek stylings that you love, nothing more than depictions of old Greek men.

490
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:29,150
Scott: There are things I love more, but I love this a lot.

491
00:25:29,692 --> 00:25:35,558
Scott: So it looks like, you know, your dude has like the shield with the snake on it, the big circle shield.

492
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,789
Scott: He throws a spear.

493
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,150
Scott: Everything's orange and black and white.

494
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:43,913
Scott: And you have those little sort of square spiral things going on on the borders of the terrain.

495
00:25:44,314 --> 00:25:51,890
Scott: And you fight like, you know, it's pretty much like you're looking in the in the Greek history section of the museum and it's come to life.

496
00:25:52,012 --> 00:25:52,949
Scott: And that's the video game.

497
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:58,790
Scott: So this video is pretty much all you need from this game, since it looks to be a pretty boring game, you don't need to actually play.

498
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:05,101
Scott: Maybe it'll be really cheap on Steam one day, but because it's pretty tight, if you like that sort of game.

499
00:26:05,243 --> 00:26:05,630
Scott: Well, yeah.

500
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:12,810
Scott: But because the styling is so good, the video promoting the game is thing of the day worthy and hence it is my thing.

501
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,889
Rym: It looks exactly like the art on the sides of Amphora.

502
00:26:16,351 --> 00:26:16,695
Scott: Yes.

503
00:26:17,161 --> 00:26:17,850
Scott: My favorite kind.

504
00:26:18,011 --> 00:26:18,548
Rym: You mean carrots?

505
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:19,855
Scott: Yeah.

506
00:26:20,138 --> 00:26:21,289
Rym: I wonder if anyone will get that.

507
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:22,567
Scott: Nobody will get that.

508
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:29,670
Rym: So in the meta moment, the book club book is still the name of the win by Patrick Rothfuss.

509
00:26:30,794 --> 00:26:31,728
Rym: I'm most of the way through it.

510
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:32,873
Rym: It's pretty good.

511
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:39,269
Rym: But the only complaint I have is that it was just rocking through scenes and drama and everything really great.

512
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:43,131
Rym: I have one on one kind of complicated complaint that I'm going to say for the book club show.

513
00:26:43,934 --> 00:26:48,510
Rym: But he's been in the school for a long time and the school isn't short.

514
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,570
Scott: How long were you in school?

515
00:26:50,052 --> 00:26:54,490
Rym: But the school, the school boy drama is just the same bullshit.

516
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,647
Rym: The jackass guy keeps being a jackass.

517
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,223
Scott: How long were you in school for?

518
00:26:59,393 --> 00:27:01,510
Rym: Well, the wizard school, five years.

519
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:02,394
Scott: Right.

520
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:04,310
Scott: So how many years has he been in the wizard school?

521
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,630
Rym: I don't need every detail.

522
00:27:07,132 --> 00:27:09,069
Scott: How how many years have you been reading this book?

523
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:11,970
Rym: I'm just saying that's a lot less than it takes.

524
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,850
Rym: I don't think most of what happened to him in school is all that important.

525
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:18,709
Scott: Well, finish the book and then we'll do an episode and we can discuss this again.

526
00:27:19,091 --> 00:27:19,814
Rym: I mean, I get it.

527
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:26,110
Rym: He's the Kellis Mary Sue Golden Child of the world, the smartest, that's the best person that's ever born.

528
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:28,189
Scott: But isn't that the book I always say I want to read?

529
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,228
Rym: Well, now you get it.

530
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:32,426
Scott: We always end up reading a book about like, you know, freakin who?

531
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:34,752
Rym: Kellis?

532
00:27:36,165 --> 00:27:36,609
Scott: Kind of.

533
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:37,133
Scott: Right.

534
00:27:37,153 --> 00:27:39,610
Scott: But how come we don't get to read a book about Seswatha?

535
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,268
Rym: We're going to get to, I think.

536
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:42,570
Scott: Or Kelmomas.

537
00:27:43,432 --> 00:27:46,390
Rym: In fact, I think things are repeating and you get the same story told again.

538
00:27:47,411 --> 00:27:49,008
Rym: Maybe that book's coming out soon.

539
00:27:49,831 --> 00:27:54,670
Scott: And how come, you know, we get this story about like, oh, Sauron, right.

540
00:27:54,770 --> 00:28:01,650
Scott: But if you want the real story, you got to read the Silmarillion, which is not as boring as far as only because it was a mishmash of a whole bunch of shit.

541
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:06,450
Scott: We could have gotten the real story of, you know, the nine kings and whatnot.

542
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:07,174
Scott: Right.

543
00:28:07,235 --> 00:28:08,830
Scott: But yeah, we didn't get that thing.

544
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:09,975
Rym: Is that plays out like.

545
00:28:10,216 --> 00:28:15,509
Rym: instead we get a story like the same burning wheel game you play, except everyone's white instead of black.

546
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,770
Scott: So instead we get a story about like, yeah, those kings.

547
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,690
Scott: Yeah, well, here's some statues of them.

548
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:25,970
Scott: It's like, no, tell me the story about the king who was so awesome that they made a giant statue of him pointing.

549
00:28:26,151 --> 00:28:26,939
Scott: King.

550
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:28,010
Scott: That's who I want to hear about.

551
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,369
Scott: I don't want to hear about some fucking hobbits.

552
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:33,850
Rym: King Awesome did a W seven wound to the beast as opposed to a B seven wound.

553
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:34,653
Scott: I love that shit.

554
00:28:35,175 --> 00:28:37,203
Scott: Hook me up where who tell me?

555
00:28:37,745 --> 00:28:39,451
Scott: anyone who reads a lot of fantasy novels.

556
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,159
Scott: Alex, where is the?

557
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,810
Scott: where is the fantasy novel that is about the great?

558
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:47,910
Scott: I guess Earthsea is about the great wizard, right, of all time.

559
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:53,909
Scott: Yeah, but even in Earthsea, there was a past, you know, time that is alluded to where dragons were all over the fuck.

560
00:28:54,071 --> 00:28:54,292
Scott: Right.

561
00:28:54,614 --> 00:28:57,270
Scott: Where is the story about the time when dragons were just all over the fuck?

562
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,370
Rym: Hopefully we'll get a flashback to Star Swirl.

563
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,193
Scott: And like there.

564
00:29:00,213 --> 00:29:00,394
Scott: Yeah.

565
00:29:00,414 --> 00:29:03,146
Scott: And there weren't any amazing castles yet.

566
00:29:03,206 --> 00:29:04,030
Scott: because guess what?

567
00:29:04,351 --> 00:29:06,490
Scott: The great king built the fucking castle.

568
00:29:07,231 --> 00:29:07,553
Scott: Right.

569
00:29:07,573 --> 00:29:12,850
Rym: You're going to be real disappointed when that king built the castle upon the ruins of the even greater, older castle.

570
00:29:13,331 --> 00:29:16,290
Scott: No, I want to hear the story of the greatest, oldest castle.

571
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,053
Rym: You know what?

572
00:29:17,073 --> 00:29:18,389
Rym: It's castles all the way down.

573
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,929
Scott: It's not castles all the way down.

574
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,150
Scott: There is a pre castle era.

575
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,829
Rym: Are you giving me some castle trash talk?

576
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,788
Scott: In which case it was not a castle, but a hut.

577
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:31,630
Rym: You're going pre castle now or a, you know, a mead hall.

578
00:29:32,831 --> 00:29:36,530
Scott: So, uh, magfest, we're going, we're going to, that's a while from now.

579
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,890
Rym: We're probably going to be doing a revamped version of losing should be fun.

580
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:44,150
Rym: And we will probably be on one or two of the gaming intellectuals things.

581
00:29:44,211 --> 00:29:45,249
Rym: We're still working on the details.

582
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:48,470
Rym: Uh, I guess anime Boston.

583
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,036
Scott: Whoa.

584
00:29:50,282 --> 00:29:50,589
Scott: Future.

585
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:51,233
Rym: Yeah.

586
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:51,990
Rym: Connecticut.

587
00:29:52,631 --> 00:29:54,109
Scott: PAX East, PAX OSS.

588
00:29:54,651 --> 00:29:54,974
Rym: Oh yeah.

589
00:29:55,054 --> 00:29:57,030
Rym: And PAX OSS is sold out of three day badges.

590
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:58,810
Rym: So if you didn't buy them, that's a shame.

591
00:29:58,952 --> 00:29:59,970
Rym: You've learned your lesson.

592
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:03,510
Rym: Now, I hope about not buying a PAX badge the day it goes on sale.

593
00:30:03,911 --> 00:30:04,373
Scott: It's a shame.

594
00:30:05,378 --> 00:30:07,790
Rym: We'll probably be there unless something bad happens.

595
00:30:08,312 --> 00:30:09,790
Scott: And I'm very, very likely to be there.

596
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:16,830
Rym: And I want to put it on the record that we have suggested perhaps the best possible names for the theaters that they could have down there.

597
00:30:17,812 --> 00:30:22,490
Rym: I think they should just take the names of the theaters from regular packs, append them with the right poisonous.

598
00:30:22,792 --> 00:30:24,810
Scott: I heard from a very extremely reliable source.

599
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:28,130
Scott: There will only be three theaters at PAX OSS.

600
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,404
Rym: I had a list that said there'll be a total of 80 panels.

601
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:32,995
Scott: Possibly.

602
00:30:33,015 --> 00:30:34,430
Rym: That sounds about right.

603
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,803
Rym: Based on, you know, we had 300 ConnectiCon across 11 rooms.

604
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,230
Scott: So, all right.

605
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,909
Scott: Let's uh, Oh, I think we had enough meta here.

606
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:44,672
Rym: Okay.

607
00:30:44,793 --> 00:30:45,156
Rym: Okay.

608
00:30:45,317 --> 00:30:46,930
Scott: Uh, let's move on to our show show.

609
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:59,210
Rym: So before we do the show show, so, you know, burning, burning count is pretty great, but I would like to point out that a long time ago we may or may not have told this anecdote, but it is very relevant to what we're about to do.

610
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,870
Rym: So I feel like it must be repeated.

611
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,070
Scott: Repeating the anecdote.

612
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,080
Rym: We knew a guy.

613
00:31:03,181 --> 00:31:03,709
Scott: Let it be written.

614
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,067
Rym: We knew a guy at RIT.

615
00:31:05,753 --> 00:31:06,667
Scott: Do you remember his name?

616
00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:06,809
Scott: Yes.

617
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,610
Rym: I remember his first and last name.

618
00:31:08,811 --> 00:31:10,290
Rym: And I remember the last time I saw him.

619
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,299
Scott: Are his initials

620
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:11,359
Scott: A.W.?

621
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,652
Scott: ?

622
00:31:12,652 --> 00:31:13,317
Rym: They are indeed.

623
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:14,910
Scott: And when was the last time you saw him?

624
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,010
Rym: When he was working at Pita Pit.

625
00:31:16,432 --> 00:31:18,869
Scott: We have seen him at the same time as last time.

626
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,990
Rym: So, uh, he's a dude.

627
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:24,050
Rym: I won't get into anything else about him because it's not really about him.

628
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:24,908
Scott: It's about all of us.

629
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:25,809
Scott: It's not about him at all.

630
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,869
Rym: This is a story for all men of all times.

631
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:31,570
Scott: Do you want to tell the story entirely on your own or shall we share in the telling?

632
00:31:32,152 --> 00:31:33,570
Rym: So I'll just get right to the point.

633
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,870
Rym: One day, dude comes up to me very early.

634
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:38,510
Scott: We only met this guy a few times at this point.

635
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:40,629
Rym: And we were talking about Dungeons and Dragons.

636
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,089
Scott: Who doesn't at nerd school?

637
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:44,190
Rym: Yeah, because we're playing Dungeons and Dragons.

638
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:45,789
Scott: Who doesn't at nerd school?

639
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,009
Rym: With Dammit Dwayne, which I think is his legal name.

640
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,426
Rym: So it is now we're playing D&D, talking about D&D.

641
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,327
Scott: We're actually at Anime Club talking about D&D.

642
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:59,030
Rym: So the AW comes over and he's like, ah, I play D&D as well.

643
00:31:59,856 --> 00:32:01,030
Scott: Ah, don't we all.

644
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,709
Scott: It's nerd school.

645
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:07,349
Rym: Now, we were talking about when we were going to play the next game or something, some like meta detail.

646
00:32:08,332 --> 00:32:11,930
Rym: He goes right in with, let me tell you about my character.

647
00:32:12,331 --> 00:32:15,470
Rym: He's a 17th level barbarian named Thag.

648
00:32:15,871 --> 00:32:17,689
Rym: It's funny because it sounds like fag.

649
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:19,144
Scott: Alrighty.

650
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,227
Rym: This went on.

651
00:32:21,234 --> 00:32:22,069
Rym: Oh, did this go on?

652
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,364
Scott: It went on far too long.

653
00:32:23,871 --> 00:32:26,530
Scott: I don't know why other people stood standing there.

654
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,510
Scott: I sort of meandered and slinked away with the back.

655
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,410
Rym: Yeah, and I think at that point I drew aggro.

656
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:34,944
Scott: But because he was loud, I still heard most of the details.

657
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,310
Rym: So I got to hear all about that.

658
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,850
Scott: I had forgotten as many as I could.

659
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:42,790
Scott: There was something about the weapon he uses was particularly gay.

660
00:32:43,191 --> 00:32:51,110
Rym: So I got to hear all about Thag and his somewhat, I don't know, bigoted adventures through the Dungeons and Dragons.

661
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:52,890
Scott: Extremely bigoted adventures.

662
00:32:53,312 --> 00:32:57,369
Scott: I would also like to point out, perhaps this is relevant, perhaps it is not.

663
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:58,753
Scott: A.W.

664
00:32:59,095 --> 00:33:01,809
Scott: may be the biggest Sailor Moon fan I've ever known.

665
00:33:02,351 --> 00:33:02,968
Rym: Uh, no.

666
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:03,355
Rym: No?

667
00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:04,167
Rym: Hoagie Steve.

668
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,030
Scott: Was he, he really liked it more?

669
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,409
Rym: Yeah, I think he liked it more.

670
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:07,919
Rym: I don't know.

671
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,029
Rym: He was also a stand up dude.

672
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:10,807
Scott: Well, yeah.

673
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,250
Scott: Oh, nothing wrong with Hoagie Steve.

674
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,610
Rym: I will stand by Hoagie Steve and his legacy.

675
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:15,949
Scott: Hoagie Steve is totally awesome.

676
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,820
Scott: Much more awesome than A.W.

677
00:33:17,881 --> 00:33:19,370
Scott: with his bigoted D&D characters.

678
00:33:19,571 --> 00:33:22,910
Rym: If any of you who are there are listening and feel bad, don't feel bad.

679
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:23,530
Scott: Uh, no.

680
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,809
Rym: So the moral here is simple.

681
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,910
Rym: Nobody wants to hear about your D&D character.

682
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:29,589
Scott: That's right.

683
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:37,670
Rym: Even if you both play Dungeons and Dragons, even if Dungeons and Dragons is the only thing either of you care about.

684
00:33:37,991 --> 00:33:42,030
Rym: If you're not in the campaign together, no one cares.

685
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:56,590
Scott: Right now, there are things that you can discuss about D&D with other people or any RPG you can discuss, you know, general ideas, you know, the mechanics, rules, you know, you can even tell interesting stories.

686
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:59,310
Scott: Don't tell about the character, but you can tell the story.

687
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,790
Scott: For example, here is a story example.

688
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,190
Scott: The one I like to tell so often from summer camp.

689
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:13,909
Scott: You know, the GM had created, you know, by hand this big ass dungeon with an evil wizard in it on the top and a castle on top of a cliff like Castlevania and shit.

690
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,949
Rym: Notice Scott has not told me the name or level of a character so far.

691
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:17,768
Scott: No, I have not.

692
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:24,989
Scott: We were all to be fun and because we were middle school kids, really high power leveled guys, right?

693
00:34:25,511 --> 00:34:27,469
Scott: One of our players was a druid.

694
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,770
Scott: He cast Summon Big Ass Monster.

695
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:46,369
Scott: He could and he selected from the monster's manual of second edition the earthworm, which proceeded to eat the ground from under the castle and it fell into the sea, thus making it completely unnecessary to go through the dungeon, meet the evil wizard or anything of the such.

696
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:55,090
Scott: The GM probably should have captured someone to be in distress that we had to rescue from the castle so that wouldn't have happened or not, but the castle on a cliff.

697
00:34:56,655 --> 00:34:57,650
Scott: And that is a funny story.

698
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:59,322
Rym: Lessons were learned all around.

699
00:34:59,383 --> 00:35:00,310
Scott: Right now.

700
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:03,150
Rym: Allow me to tell a story and I'm going to tell it in the incorrect way.

701
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:05,569
Rym: Oh, so I was playing Elaeth Redere.

702
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,530
Rym: He was a 16th level blade singer.

703
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:08,395
Scott: This is all true.

704
00:35:08,415 --> 00:35:10,569
Scott: people just want to let everyone know.

705
00:35:11,672 --> 00:35:16,820
Scott: I can verify for one hundred percent that everything he's telling you in this story is true.

706
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:18,750
Scott: in that Rym did play this character.

707
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:23,370
Rym: Now, I converted him from second head to third head and he got a lot less powerful in third head because the way they changed the rules.

708
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:29,449
Rym: But in second head, he had up to four or five attacks per round, depending on the no one cares.

709
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,490
Scott: You're not going to get going.

710
00:35:30,993 --> 00:35:31,730
Rym: No, I'm not going to keep going.

711
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:32,569
Scott: But don't you really?

712
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,129
Scott: But see, I just want to verify one thing.

713
00:35:35,531 --> 00:35:38,330
Scott: While we agreed, no one wants to hear that and no one cares.

714
00:35:38,894 --> 00:35:41,250
Scott: Do you or do you not enjoy telling those things?

715
00:35:41,831 --> 00:35:42,690
Rym: It feels real good.

716
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:43,494
Scott: There you go.

717
00:35:43,615 --> 00:35:49,590
Scott: And this is why people do not learn this lesson, because everyone loves to tell you about their character.

718
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,969
Scott: No one likes listening to anyone else.

719
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,589
Scott: So here talk about their character.

720
00:35:54,074 --> 00:35:59,910
Rym: It is possible to talk about your characters if you tell what is actually an amusing anecdote.

721
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:07,230
Rym: So mechanical details like if I'm telling Luke Crane, the creator of Burning Wheel, about something crazy that happened in my game.

722
00:36:07,712 --> 00:36:17,830
Rym: If I say like OBS 10, eight dice success, the mechanical details actually will be relevant and interesting to him in the context of the story.

723
00:36:18,451 --> 00:36:20,489
Rym: For most other people in the world, that is not true.

724
00:36:20,951 --> 00:36:30,269
Rym: If you cannot gauge whether or not your audience cares about what level your barbarian was, you should probably leave that detail out and get to the meaty part, like when he killed the dude.

725
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:36,170
Scott: So with that being said, we both went to Burning Con where we did nothing but play our tabletop RPGs for a weekend.

726
00:36:36,451 --> 00:36:39,521
Scott: Let us tell you about the games we played when.

727
00:36:39,561 --> 00:36:42,170
Scott: there is one great exception to this rule.

728
00:36:42,872 --> 00:36:45,690
Scott: And that is you can say whatever you want if you have a podcast.

729
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,189
Scott: And there's another great exception to this rule.

730
00:36:49,052 --> 00:36:52,770
Scott: If you don't like listening to us talk about it, just turn this podcast the fuck off.

731
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,810
Scott: In fact, why are you even listening to this podcast?

732
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,058
Scott: What is wrong with you?

733
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:57,049
Scott: Don't you have something better to do?

734
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:58,051
Scott: All right.

735
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:02,290
Scott: So Burning Con is the third Burning Con.

736
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:08,990
Scott: It was the Triad Umbert featuring the games of Luke Crane, Vince Baker and John Harper.

737
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:09,711
Scott: Yes.

738
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:10,092
Scott: Yes.

739
00:37:11,055 --> 00:37:15,550
Scott: So, of course, when you go to Burning Con, you must run a session.

740
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,229
Scott: And there are a total of five sessions.

741
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:19,410
Scott: Despite hurricanes, all of the sessions happened.

742
00:37:20,352 --> 00:37:23,190
Scott: And I played in four sessions and ran the final session.

743
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,033
Rym: I did the same.

744
00:37:24,134 --> 00:37:27,130
Scott: And it was like you ran the first session and played four sessions after.

745
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,530
Rym: But I played the same number of games.

746
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,210
Rym: I had the same basic experience in a slightly different order.

747
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,630
Scott: So let us briefly discuss the sessions that we have played.

748
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:37,770
Rym: Let's start with the one that we both did, because that actually was pretty great.

749
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,786
Scott: OK, so this is run by our friend Matt from NerdNYC.

750
00:37:41,354 --> 00:37:42,589
Scott: And it's kind of funny because I knew Matt.

751
00:37:42,872 --> 00:37:43,789
Scott: I saw that he was there.

752
00:37:44,393 --> 00:37:45,728
Scott: I knew him from NerdNYC.

753
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:46,861
Scott: He's an acquaintance.

754
00:37:47,144 --> 00:37:47,689
Scott: He's a good guy.

755
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,650
Rym: He had played in my game just before.

756
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:53,290
Scott: And I was looking at the schedule and I saw this Burning Wheel game about dwarves.

757
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:55,310
Scott: And I said, I'll play a Burning Wheel game about dwarves.

758
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,182
Scott: Who's Matt?

759
00:37:56,305 --> 00:37:56,570
Scott: something?

760
00:37:57,352 --> 00:37:58,349
Scott: I didn't know his last name.

761
00:37:58,771 --> 00:37:59,518
Scott: I go over to the table.

762
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:00,650
Scott: I see Matt sitting there.

763
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:03,690
Scott: And I'm like, oh, yeah, OK, it's the same guy.

764
00:38:04,212 --> 00:38:06,510
Scott: This is what I get for not learning people's last names.

765
00:38:06,871 --> 00:38:11,750
Scott: But then knowing him, I'm like, I know he plays the RPGs, but I've never RPG'd with Matt.

766
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,350
Scott: I wonder if he is any good.

767
00:38:13,753 --> 00:38:15,749
Scott: And in fact, he was very good.

768
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:19,910
Rym: Well, I think his game was very nice is what I'm glad.

769
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:25,130
Rym: One of the most important things about Burning Con is that they had a very strict rule about no hacks, no bullshit.

770
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:27,383
Rym: I changed the rules of Burning Wheel because I do have hacks.

771
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,709
Scott: It just says parentheses hack.

772
00:38:29,931 --> 00:38:32,330
Scott: So a lot of games said parentheses hack.

773
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,212
Rym: So what?

774
00:38:33,252 --> 00:38:46,290
Rym: to to be allowed to run a hack of one of the games, you had to submit all the weird rules and everything possible about your quote hack to the people running the convention for review.

775
00:38:46,371 --> 00:38:48,030
Rym: And they had full veto power.

776
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:48,432
Rym: All right.

777
00:38:48,633 --> 00:38:51,950
Rym: If you did not do this, they offered dire consequences.

778
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:54,310
Scott: Burning Con is a curated convention.

779
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,509
Scott: They beat the three.

780
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,929
Scott: You know, the triad Umbritt will decide which games will be run when.

781
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:02,370
Scott: So we played in Matt's game, which was not a hack at all.

782
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,488
Scott: It was Burning Wheel with dwarves.

783
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:05,830
Rym: Burning Wheel is pretty damn good.

784
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:12,430
Rym: The strength of Burning Wheel, the best convention scenarios are the very straightforward ones, usually involving dwarves.

785
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:15,070
Scott: That's why I played in five great games.

786
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:19,531
Scott: And I blame that on always choosing the straightforward Burning Wheel game most of the time.

787
00:39:19,571 --> 00:39:23,270
Scott: So his game was pretty much about these dwarves.

788
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:31,610
Scott: And the deal was there were two dwarven castles and two complete asshole dwarven princes, two dwarven princes, one dwarf assholes.

789
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:32,416
Rym: That's very important.

790
00:39:32,577 --> 00:39:34,430
Scott: One dwarven prince had been there for a long time.

791
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:43,090
Scott: The other one had only appeared recently and they were both competing to dig up precious things from the same mountain range in different mountains.

792
00:39:43,191 --> 00:39:44,370
Rym: It was versus Dwarf Fortress.

793
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:44,710
Scott: Yes.

794
00:39:44,771 --> 00:39:49,250
Scott: To see, you know, which one their father would approve of more than the other.

795
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:49,490
Scott: Now.

796
00:39:50,715 --> 00:39:54,971
Scott: When we were selecting characters, I actually did something that I usually do not do.

797
00:39:55,172 --> 00:39:58,770
Scott: Usually I choose, Rym can tell what kind of character I will choose.

798
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:02,430
Rym: Scott usually wants to choose either the guy who's not related to the game at all.

799
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,292
Scott: That's a good one.

800
00:40:03,614 --> 00:40:12,374
Rym: Or he wants to choose like usually like the standoffish thief or the guy who's like the super powerful in his particular little realm, like support character.

801
00:40:12,394 --> 00:40:12,779
Rym: Yes.

802
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,790
Scott: I like merchants.

803
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:14,758
Scott: Right.

804
00:40:14,778 --> 00:40:15,470
Rym: You know, something like that.

805
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:18,070
Scott: I want to choose like when he played Inheritance, who did I choose?

806
00:40:18,691 --> 00:40:21,849
Scott: The dwarven mystical guy with the magic rings.

807
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:23,299
Scott: The magic rings.

808
00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:24,770
Scott: The off to the side guy.

809
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,209
Scott: But this time I said, you know what?

810
00:40:27,233 --> 00:40:28,849
Scott: I'm going to choose the number one guy.

811
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,070
Scott: Give me the dwarven prince.

812
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:31,973
Scott: I demanded it.

813
00:40:32,434 --> 00:40:37,058
Rym: So and I received it was not an asshole when the character she was handed to Scott.

814
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:37,748
Scott: Yes, it was.

815
00:40:38,975 --> 00:40:39,381
Rym: Well, yes.

816
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:40,009
Rym: Yes, it was.

817
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:45,510
Rym: The moment you touched it, he became perhaps the second greatest asshole in that game.

818
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:48,750
Scott: There's nothing on that character sheet that said nice guy on it.

819
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:49,657
Rym: There was nothing on it.

820
00:40:49,677 --> 00:40:51,030
Rym: Do you have the trait asshole?

821
00:40:51,353 --> 00:40:53,090
Scott: It was they had the trait of greedy.

822
00:40:53,894 --> 00:40:55,290
Rym: I also had the trait of greedy.

823
00:40:55,871 --> 00:41:01,190
Scott: OK, I had not only the trait, but also the emotional attribute of greed.

824
00:41:01,412 --> 00:41:01,473
Rym: OK.

825
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:01,839
Rym: Right.

826
00:41:03,472 --> 00:41:07,970
Scott: All my beliefs were all about digging up as much shit as possible.

827
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,069
Rym: So this broke down pretty well.

828
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:09,793
Rym: I was Scotty.

829
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:13,976
Rym: I was like the super engineer, like I managed all the mining and all the bullshit.

830
00:41:14,016 --> 00:41:14,969
Scott: That is what you were in.

831
00:41:15,451 --> 00:41:15,532
Rym: Yeah.

832
00:41:15,552 --> 00:41:18,812
Rym: So I kind of played that kind of guy, which I usually actually like playing a guy like that.

833
00:41:19,274 --> 00:41:23,472
Rym: But it was a kind of an aside because usually I play the big bad like leader type.

834
00:41:24,437 --> 00:41:26,690
Rym: So Scott played the asshole and I played the engineer.

835
00:41:27,273 --> 00:41:28,850
Rym: And of course, bullshit goes down in the mine.

836
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:29,819
Rym: A bunch of dwarves disappear.

837
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:30,930
Scott: Well, there were two other players.

838
00:41:31,252 --> 00:41:31,455
Rym: Oh, yeah.

839
00:41:31,475 --> 00:41:32,268
Rym: They were playing whatever.

840
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:34,509
Scott: Actually, they were really good.

841
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:34,971
Scott: Yeah.

842
00:41:35,111 --> 00:41:36,637
Scott: One of them was the.

843
00:41:36,657 --> 00:41:39,990
Scott: I'm trying to remember what their dwarves did.

844
00:41:40,211 --> 00:41:41,449
Rym: It was only a few days ago.

845
00:41:41,731 --> 00:41:42,627
Scott: Scott, I know.

846
00:41:44,741 --> 00:41:44,926
Rym: Really?

847
00:41:44,946 --> 00:41:45,069
Rym: Really?

848
00:41:47,391 --> 00:41:47,822
Rym: Really?

849
00:41:47,842 --> 00:41:48,150
Rym: Really?

850
00:41:49,654 --> 00:41:52,088
Rym: So we had the advisor, the smart guy.

851
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:55,408
Scott: No, the advisor was the was an NPC.

852
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:57,873
Scott: The seneschal.

853
00:41:58,255 --> 00:42:02,170
Rym: Yeah, well, basically one of the characters ended up effectively being the advisor to Scott.

854
00:42:03,697 --> 00:42:03,737
Rym: OK.

855
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,450
Rym: And the story is pretty simple.

856
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:08,370
Rym: The mines, some bullshit happens, bunch of dwarves disappear.

857
00:42:08,851 --> 00:42:15,110
Rym: So he goes to investigate and it turns out there's a huge spider army and a spider princess.

858
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:16,650
Rym: Nobody would roll seduction.

859
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,069
Rym: I was actually really pissed off about that.

860
00:42:18,752 --> 00:42:20,059
Rym: You should have.

861
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,010
Rym: And we wanted to wait.

862
00:42:22,391 --> 00:42:22,572
Rym: Well, no.

863
00:42:22,633 --> 00:42:24,229
Rym: Scott wanted to kill all the spiders.

864
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:26,270
Scott: I didn't want to kill the spiders.

865
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:32,169
Scott: I wanted to safely extract all of the riches from the mountain, which would not have been possible with a spider presence.

866
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:32,551
Rym: Yeah.

867
00:42:32,571 --> 00:42:36,082
Rym: So he basically wants to get the spiders out of the way and get all these gems and rubies and whatever.

868
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:36,529
Rym: Yeah.

869
00:42:37,252 --> 00:42:41,832
Rym: The other dude wants to negotiate with the spiders because they actually seem pretty chill.

870
00:42:42,314 --> 00:42:45,509
Scott: I was willing to allow negotiations to occur.

871
00:42:46,873 --> 00:42:48,990
Scott: But I did not have faith that they would be successful.

872
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:53,189
Rym: It took a deeds point in a duel of wits to convince you to let us do this.

873
00:42:54,030 --> 00:43:05,737
Rym: Yeah, this is very important because you see, when everything fell apart and the shit hit the fan, all Scott did was turn to the character who made this happen and say, this is your deeds point.

874
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:06,849
Rym: You wanted this.

875
00:43:07,514 --> 00:43:08,830
Rym: This is what you wanted.

876
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:09,531
Scott: That's right.

877
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:17,230
Rym: So the spiders wanted a sacrifice of a dwarven prince because we owed them some debt.

878
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:21,910
Rym: So, of course, immediately all of us underling dwarves are like, Scott's really an asshole.

879
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:26,350
Rym: Let's just sacrifice him to these spiders and then make an alliance with them.

880
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:27,432
Scott: Of course.

881
00:43:27,914 --> 00:43:31,910
Rym: So Scott tries to instead sacrifice his worthless brother.

882
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:32,773
Scott: Why not?

883
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,289
Rym: I was perfectly willing to help.

884
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:39,930
Rym: And when I asked you to just fund me for the ability to do it.

885
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:42,429
Scott: Wait, you asked for unlimited funds.

886
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:53,410
Scott: You were a traitor as you were willing to turn against, you know, and throw away your dwarven loyalty and your dwarven oath in or in for money against.

887
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:58,910
Rym: You were asking me to turn those ballista around at the true prince of the land.

888
00:44:00,011 --> 00:44:05,960
Rym: No, I just sacrifice him to a spider when I was perfectly willing to sacrifice you instead.

889
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:06,306
Rym: Right.

890
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:12,510
Scott: And that is why I tried to slay the eye for your disloyalty and dishonor.

891
00:44:13,055 --> 00:44:14,330
Rym: Like a gold piece.

892
00:44:14,631 --> 00:44:17,350
Rym: I would have been like, OK, you said unlimited funds.

893
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:23,194
Scott: If you had asked for like, you know, 10 gold or something, we could have maybe gotten to negotiations.

894
00:44:23,254 --> 00:44:26,290
Scott: But you could have had since your demand was so extreme.

895
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:28,757
Rym: I offered a suggestion.

896
00:44:28,897 --> 00:44:32,530
Scott: that was like walking into a discussion with a crazy creationist.

897
00:44:33,091 --> 00:44:39,072
Rym: I was even going to you were golden gems and your counteroffer was cold, hard acts to my neck.

898
00:44:39,536 --> 00:44:41,410
Scott: And did that act strike true?

899
00:44:41,451 --> 00:44:42,929
Rym: No, because you suck at axes.

900
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:47,948
Rym: And I ran into the castle and barricaded against you and proceeded to try to murder you and everyone around you.

901
00:44:48,731 --> 00:44:52,229
Scott: And who turned out the winner at the end of the day?

902
00:44:52,872 --> 00:44:55,209
Rym: So basically, fuck you.

903
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:56,995
Scott: That's right.

904
00:44:57,015 --> 00:45:02,050
Rym: It wasn't so bad because one, you see, here's how much asshole Scott is.

905
00:45:02,351 --> 00:45:06,770
Rym: So he tries to kill or steal his worthless brother and sell him to spiders anyway.

906
00:45:07,132 --> 00:45:08,710
Rym: He fails at it due to incompetence.

907
00:45:09,716 --> 00:45:10,709
Rym: He comes back dice.

908
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:11,849
Scott: I failed that to do a dice.

909
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:13,849
Rym: So meanwhile, these two dwarven princes are fighting.

910
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:15,016
Rym: The rest of us go to the spiders.

911
00:45:15,036 --> 00:45:17,450
Rym: Well, I tell you what, Daddy, two dwarven princes.

912
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:23,368
Rym: That's what you did and didn't go so well because Scott sucks and stuff went wrong.

913
00:45:24,211 --> 00:45:25,750
Scott: I got the dice turned to my favorite.

914
00:45:26,772 --> 00:45:35,708
Rym: So finally, basically he murders me, imprisons my wife, murders in cold blood the spider princess and both of her innocent retainers.

915
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:38,788
Scott: Innocent spiders trying to eat me.

916
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:42,330
Rym: Yeah, based on a deal your granddaddy made with the spiders.

917
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:43,706
Scott: Yeah, nothing to do with me.

918
00:45:45,071 --> 00:45:46,490
Rym: Yeah, dwarven blood and all.

919
00:45:46,991 --> 00:45:48,140
Scott: Right.

920
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,409
Rym: So he does that.

921
00:45:49,711 --> 00:45:52,990
Rym: And thus he has no real army or way to defend the fortress.

922
00:45:53,213 --> 00:45:54,350
Rym: And then the spiders come in the night.

923
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:59,610
Scott: It's moving to my dead brother's fortress, which is a castle and not just a fort.

924
00:45:59,811 --> 00:46:00,930
Rym: The denim was kind of sad.

925
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:02,570
Rym: I think you guys survived, but it wasn't great.

926
00:46:03,492 --> 00:46:04,117
Scott: Yeah, I survived.

927
00:46:04,299 --> 00:46:05,630
Rym: I just I take issue with your.

928
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:13,550
Rym: A tactical decision to murder the head of both your artillery and your mining operations the mere hours before the spiders were going to invade.

929
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:16,467
Scott: You were just upset because that was you.

930
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:21,691
Scott: If it was not you, those being murdered, you probably wouldn't have felt bad about it at all.

931
00:46:22,075 --> 00:46:23,550
Rym: It was a pretty great example.

932
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:30,770
Scott: If the Senate shawl had been a player character and that was you and the engineer was an MPC and I wanted to kill the engineer, you would not have given two shits.

933
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:33,909
Rym: I like how the Senate was like, no, but I'm a reasonable man.

934
00:46:34,493 --> 00:46:36,083
Scott: The Senate was the greatest because I had this.

935
00:46:36,163 --> 00:46:37,230
Scott: I had this instinct.

936
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:38,490
Scott: He betrayed whoever.

937
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:42,430
Scott: There's the MPC, the Senate shawl, who was like the old wise dwarf to ask for advice.

938
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:43,990
Scott: I had an instinct to always ask him for advice.

939
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:44,935
Scott: So I always did.

940
00:46:44,955 --> 00:46:47,290
Scott: And he and then Matt always did good.

941
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:51,830
Scott: Matt always came in like, oh, I'm the old dwarf and you should do this.

942
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:55,550
Scott: When you were like, I said, and whenever he said I did, I was like, yes, I'll do that.

943
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:58,230
Rym: You were like, I'm going to betray my brother and feed him to the spiders.

944
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:02,529
Rym: And the Senate shawl was like, that seems like the most wise course of action.

945
00:47:04,511 --> 00:47:04,772
Scott: Yeah.

946
00:47:04,792 --> 00:47:11,327
Scott: So in fact, you can blame some of my jerky actions on the advice of the GM who told me exactly what to do.

947
00:47:12,673 --> 00:47:13,649
Scott: So that was a good game.

948
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:14,613
Rym: It was a great game.

949
00:47:14,653 --> 00:47:23,682
Rym: I got to tell you, if you ever need to run a short, like four hour one off burning wheel game, you cannot go wrong with just burning up four dwarves and giving them beliefs.

950
00:47:23,702 --> 00:47:24,170
Scott: All right.

951
00:47:24,391 --> 00:47:25,160
Scott: What are the games you play?

952
00:47:25,181 --> 00:47:25,970
Scott: And I played in this game.

953
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:27,890
Scott: The first game I played in was with Rachel.

954
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:29,270
Scott: Hey, Rachel, are you listening?

955
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:29,732
Scott: I don't know.

956
00:47:29,773 --> 00:47:32,250
Scott: Maybe Rachel's totally awesome.

957
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:33,690
Rym: Rachel is pretty badass.

958
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:35,110
Rym: I played in several games with her.

959
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:38,290
Scott: Her game was like, you know, I had first priority in that slot.

960
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:41,590
Scott: And I'm thankful because that is the game people were piling on because people know.

961
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:45,250
Scott: And Rachel, she like, you know, I prepared by burning up characters.

962
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:46,830
Scott: Rachel fucking prepares.

963
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:47,211
Scott: Right.

964
00:47:47,432 --> 00:47:52,990
Scott: She had little stand ups, little faces and little name thingies that little, you know, tense for each character.

965
00:47:53,491 --> 00:47:59,329
Scott: And she had like little she had a little stack of paper with a bunch of like people's photographs printed on them.

966
00:47:59,631 --> 00:48:08,129
Scott: And whenever a new character, NPC came into the game, she'd write their name on the paper and lay it on the table so that you could remember all the different characters that were going around.

967
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,449
Scott: And oh, man, she she's got the shit going on.

968
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:11,570
Rym: Actually, you know, I did my games.

969
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:13,090
Rym: I'm going to do it from now on forever.

970
00:48:13,611 --> 00:48:17,250
Rym: I brought sticky name tags that I wrote the names of the characters on.

971
00:48:17,593 --> 00:48:19,090
Rym: I didn't put them on the people because that doesn't work.

972
00:48:19,191 --> 00:48:21,030
Rym: I taped into the table in front of each player.

973
00:48:21,251 --> 00:48:21,372
Scott: Yeah.

974
00:48:21,433 --> 00:48:23,349
Scott: She did the same thing with the tents, with the pictures, though.

975
00:48:23,916 --> 00:48:24,139
Rym: Yeah.

976
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:25,110
Scott: She really prepared.

977
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:25,995
Rym: So I didn't have pictures.

978
00:48:26,015 --> 00:48:28,530
Scott: The game we played, she called it the wreck.

979
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:32,590
Scott: And basically the idea was it was a prison ship and it was going to a prison colony.

980
00:48:32,711 --> 00:48:34,390
Scott: And we were all thieves that had been caught.

981
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:35,253
Scott: Right.

982
00:48:35,274 --> 00:48:36,310
Scott: And we were in the prison ship.

983
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:38,670
Scott: But then the ship crashes on the shore.

984
00:48:39,131 --> 00:48:42,330
Scott: It's on the same island as the colony, but it's not at the colony.

985
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:43,590
Scott: It's like around the other side of the island.

986
00:48:44,633 --> 00:48:47,970
Scott: So, of course, we're mostly free except for some shackles.

987
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:54,030
Scott: Most of everyone else is dead except for the PCs, a couple of NPCs and like the captain.

988
00:48:54,851 --> 00:48:59,770
Scott: And then shit goes down and shit went down pretty well.

989
00:48:59,831 --> 00:49:00,701
Scott: And it was sort of weird.

990
00:49:00,721 --> 00:49:01,490
Scott: It's like I'm playing.

991
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:07,810
Scott: And I sort of felt like I was coasting along, you know, getting fair amount of spotlight time.

992
00:49:08,231 --> 00:49:08,513
Scott: Right.

993
00:49:08,573 --> 00:49:13,070
Scott: You know, I was feeling good about what I was doing, but I really felt, you know, you know, I wasn't the main person.

994
00:49:13,292 --> 00:49:13,494
Scott: I was.

995
00:49:13,595 --> 00:49:15,130
Scott: I was sort of, you know, maybe secondary.

996
00:49:15,591 --> 00:49:15,833
Scott: Right.

997
00:49:15,874 --> 00:49:17,910
Scott: But the plot got in a really good way.

998
00:49:18,191 --> 00:49:31,290
Scott: You know, we managed to get some disguises and get, you know, trick people into thinking that we weren't prisoners and then going into town and taking care of all the NPCs who might have wanted to send us to the prison colony.

999
00:49:31,771 --> 00:49:37,751
Scott: And sort of set up a new life of, you know, thievery and thieves guildishness on this island.

1000
00:49:37,792 --> 00:49:43,433
Scott: That was sort of a brand new colony, you know, and things actually turned out pretty well for us.

1001
00:49:43,695 --> 00:49:48,670
Scott: But, you know, there were not a lack of conflicts along the way, meeting strangers in the woods.

1002
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:49,850
Rym: Whoa, wait, wait, wait a minute.

1003
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:51,550
Rym: Conflicts and a burning wheel game.

1004
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:53,277
Scott: No, you know, he was.

1005
00:49:53,317 --> 00:49:55,730
Scott: he was overall a most excellent game.

1006
00:49:55,810 --> 00:50:00,852
Scott: It didn't really have any of those too many killer, crazy, exciting moments like trying to kill him.

1007
00:50:01,454 --> 00:50:11,493
Scott: But great moments, nonetheless, like tricking the guy in the woods and the thinking that one of us was the captain and just stabbing the captain in the fucking neck.

1008
00:50:12,016 --> 00:50:14,150
Scott: Shit like that, you know, good stuff.

1009
00:50:14,571 --> 00:50:20,330
Rym: So the first game I played after the dwarf game was a peak role playing experience for me.

1010
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:23,251
Rym: It was actually one of the greatest role playing experiences I've ever had in my life.

1011
00:50:24,053 --> 00:50:31,570
Rym: So the first actual burning wheel I ever played, you know, when the scary loot crane wasn't that wasn't just a demo.

1012
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:31,970
Rym: Yeah.

1013
00:50:31,991 --> 00:50:36,869
Rym: So this loot crane motherfucker tricked me into playing this demo and then he tricked me in playing this other demo and then it was on.

1014
00:50:37,151 --> 00:50:40,590
Rym: Yeah, but the first real burning wheel game I played was that Ubercon.

1015
00:50:41,194 --> 00:50:41,866
Rym: Scott was there.

1016
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:43,489
Scott: Was there an episode about this?

1017
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:44,849
Rym: There might be, but it was inheritance.

1018
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:49,170
Rym: It was a larvish burning wheel scenario for a whole shit ton of people.

1019
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:50,530
Scott: It's about a Viking funeral.

1020
00:50:52,114 --> 00:50:54,670
Rym: So he's been keeping this in his head and mulling over for a long time.

1021
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:57,150
Rym: And he ran it and he's run it several times in this format.

1022
00:50:57,911 --> 00:51:04,695
Rym: He ran it at burning con for nine people as a straight larp, no dice, and he changed himself.

1023
00:51:04,735 --> 00:51:05,589
Rym: He got rid of the dwarf.

1024
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:06,609
Rym: This magic runes.

1025
00:51:07,031 --> 00:51:08,550
Scott: No, it's the most important guy.

1026
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:09,256
Scott: Not really.

1027
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:10,850
Scott: No, I think actually merging.

1028
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:19,230
Scott: I mean, I love the dwarven runes guy, but merging the role of the dwarven runes guy with the Christian priest guy really streamlines it.

1029
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:20,135
Scott: That is an excellent move.

1030
00:51:20,175 --> 00:51:29,449
Rym: So you could tell this was big because despite having nine player slots and being the last slot on Saturday, I was the only number two priority person in the game and everyone else was priority one.

1031
00:51:30,472 --> 00:51:33,530
Rym: I only got my slot because I got there first and because I had the GoPro.

1032
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:36,230
Rym: So I think they kind of wanted that to get my GoPro.

1033
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:37,038
Scott: You got in with.

1034
00:51:37,241 --> 00:51:37,808
Rym: Yeah, I think so.

1035
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:39,358
Scott: Got in with my camera.

1036
00:51:39,419 --> 00:51:40,690
Scott: So what if I should not brought it?

1037
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:41,801
Rym: So here's the deal.

1038
00:51:41,841 --> 00:51:42,589
Rym: I had mine with me, too.

1039
00:51:42,711 --> 00:51:43,747
Rym: I just didn't set it up.

1040
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:46,009
Rym: So here's the deal with this game.

1041
00:51:46,612 --> 00:51:52,430
Rym: He talked a bit about, you know, we talked a bit about those sort of hardcore Danish role playing games and the room had a big table in it in these areas.

1042
00:51:52,952 --> 00:51:54,449
Rym: And he used these very interesting rules.

1043
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,670
Rym: The only rules were body language and envelopes weren't allowed to open.

1044
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:04,737
Rym: So the way it worked was you just walked around, you're in the big house and, you know, like a Viking house.

1045
00:52:04,818 --> 00:52:06,370
Rym: And I think the year eleven hundred or something.

1046
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:12,510
Rym: And if you are in a conversation, you have to stand like in the circle of the conversation with your name tag visible.

1047
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:19,394
Rym: If you are eavesdropping on a conversation, you stand a little bit back and hold your hand over your name tag.

1048
00:52:19,816 --> 00:52:23,054
Rym: No one can engage you, but you cannot interact with the scene at all.

1049
00:52:23,661 --> 00:52:24,410
Scott: Oh, but eavesdropped.

1050
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:26,550
Scott: But you can always enter the scene by taking your hand off.

1051
00:52:27,112 --> 00:52:27,453
Scott: No, no.

1052
00:52:27,754 --> 00:52:41,876
Rym: If you are eavesdropping, you cannot enter as your next scene, the scene on which you are eavesdropping, which is actually I don't want to get in all the details of why, but watching it play out is a brilliant rule that this game would not work without that rule.

1053
00:52:41,937 --> 00:52:43,270
Scott: That is a clever rule.

1054
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:57,950
Rym: So the other rule is if you are in a scene and it is a confrontational or adversarial thing, you stand shoulder to shoulder angled slightly inward with the people you are allied with, sort of encircling the person you are against.

1055
00:52:58,451 --> 00:53:08,535
Scott: So anyone looking at the scene, just glancing even can see very obviously, even if they're in another scene and not eavesdropping, they can still see the other scenes and how they are constructed.

1056
00:53:08,555 --> 00:53:12,094
Rym: They can see who is outnumbered or like who's confronting who.

1057
00:53:12,696 --> 00:53:17,639
Rym: Even more importantly, all information learned while eavesdropping officially can be used openly.

1058
00:53:17,962 --> 00:53:18,828
Rym: Your character knows it.

1059
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:24,588
Scott: So there are three and no one can catch you eavesdropping, prevent you from dropping.

1060
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:29,935
Rym: And there are three areas outside the house, in the private rooms of the house and in the great hall in the middle.

1061
00:53:29,955 --> 00:53:33,177
Rym: So if you're in the great hall, everyone in the great hall is all together all the time.

1062
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:35,130
Rym: You walk around the great hall and can interact.

1063
00:53:35,972 --> 00:53:38,030
Rym: And it's the story of the prodigal son returning.

1064
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:39,630
Rym: The Viking grandfather has died.

1065
00:53:39,992 --> 00:53:41,950
Rym: They're burning his body in the traditional way.

1066
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:43,410
Scott: All the sons have returned.

1067
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:45,270
Scott: Which one will inherit, you know, inheritance?

1068
00:53:45,413 --> 00:53:46,230
Scott: Which one will inherit?

1069
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:47,789
Rym: So the two families are there.

1070
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:52,830
Rym: The one son is a worthless, coward, baby loser.

1071
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:55,850
Scott: One's the badass, awesome, real Viking guy, right?

1072
00:53:56,551 --> 00:53:57,870
Rym: So the other son.

1073
00:53:58,050 --> 00:53:58,869
Scott: And one's the Christian guy.

1074
00:53:59,110 --> 00:53:59,454
Rym: No, no, no.

1075
00:53:59,495 --> 00:54:00,810
Rym: So the other, you don't remember this.

1076
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:01,385
Scott: They changed it.

1077
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:02,690
Rym: No, you just don't remember.

1078
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:03,171
Rym: All right.

1079
00:54:03,352 --> 00:54:08,629
Rym: So the other son actually wasn't there because he was exiled for murdering his fucking brother.

1080
00:54:09,271 --> 00:54:12,330
Rym: He was exiled by the father himself from the family.

1081
00:54:12,671 --> 00:54:17,532
Rym: So the exiled son returns on the night of the grandfather's funeral to claim his inheritance.

1082
00:54:18,274 --> 00:54:26,510
Rym: I played the former Varangian guard, strong man who shows up with him to make sure the family doesn't just murder him outright bodyguard.

1083
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:27,507
Rym: I played the bodyguard.

1084
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:35,770
Scott: I mean, when we played inheritance in the burning wheel fashion many years ago, the bodyguard was actually one of the more not exciting characters.

1085
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:36,092
Rym: Yes.

1086
00:54:36,153 --> 00:54:37,908
Rym: So he was updated a little bit.

1087
00:54:38,512 --> 00:54:38,893
Scott: And it's like.

1088
00:54:38,933 --> 00:54:44,469
Scott: his only purpose is a mechanical purpose, which was to prevent the prodigal son from being a meat.

1089
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:48,735
Rym: I don't know what the character, she'd said when the person played the thug before, because he was still a thug.

1090
00:54:48,997 --> 00:54:51,190
Rym: He is a consummate badass in every.

1091
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:56,351
Scott: But now he has the purpose of his own in addition to just protecting the prince from death.

1092
00:54:57,516 --> 00:54:58,620
Rym: Sort of I kind of.

1093
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,468
Rym: I don't know what he might have had that in the game we played and the guy just didn't really play it up.

1094
00:55:03,093 --> 00:55:04,569
Rym: But basically I was worldly.

1095
00:55:04,731 --> 00:55:05,300
Rym: I'd been around.

1096
00:55:05,381 --> 00:55:05,828
Rym: I'm a badass.

1097
00:55:06,633 --> 00:55:10,650
Rym: And I wanted to marry a girl who my friend wanted to marry.

1098
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:18,169
Rym: And simultaneously I wanted my friend, you know, the exiled prodigal son, to claim the inheritance because he's my friend and I'll also be rich.

1099
00:55:19,331 --> 00:55:21,090
Rym: So I'm going to skip a whole bunch of details.

1100
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:21,833
Rym: What happened?

1101
00:55:22,415 --> 00:55:25,769
Rym: And I can safely say that I won this game.

1102
00:55:26,553 --> 00:55:28,370
Rym: That ended with everyone dead.

1103
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:31,230
Scott: I like how we always say you can't win our winning and losing.

1104
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:34,469
Rym: Everyone came up to me and they were like, wow, you won.

1105
00:55:35,274 --> 00:55:36,590
Scott: And I won in a game where there's no inheritance.

1106
00:55:37,711 --> 00:55:41,690
Rym: Yes, I got the inheritance from both families and I got to marry the girl.

1107
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:42,897
Rym: I had an army.

1108
00:55:43,038 --> 00:55:44,210
Rym: I had everything.

1109
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:48,489
Scott: Well, I mean, there's no winning in RPGs, but if that's true, that's about as close to winning as you can get.

1110
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:49,810
Rym: I had everything.

1111
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:53,753
Rym: If it was the game we played before, it meant I had all the gold, everything in the will.

1112
00:55:54,098 --> 00:55:54,849
Rym: I married the girl.

1113
00:55:55,271 --> 00:55:57,649
Rym: Every enemy was dead and the priest.

1114
00:55:58,791 --> 00:56:02,670
Rym: Now, the best part of this is I didn't kill anyone.

1115
00:56:03,354 --> 00:56:04,490
Rym: They all killed each other.

1116
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:05,358
Rym: All I did was stand.

1117
00:56:05,378 --> 00:56:06,650
Rym: There's this moment the whole time.

1118
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:08,990
Rym: Luke Crane keeps coming up to me and whispering in my ear.

1119
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:11,490
Rym: He's like, Rym, you've got to make your move.

1120
00:56:11,651 --> 00:56:12,335
Rym: You're going to lose it.

1121
00:56:12,859 --> 00:56:14,530
Rym: You're not you're not being active enough.

1122
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:15,645
Rym: You're you're going to lose it.

1123
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:15,929
Rym: Come on.

1124
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:17,330
Rym: Be you know, do something.

1125
00:56:17,993 --> 00:56:19,085
Rym: And I'm like, no, no, I got this.

1126
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:19,448
Rym: Shut up.

1127
00:56:20,013 --> 00:56:20,748
Rym: And yeah, I had that.

1128
00:56:21,092 --> 00:56:22,310
Rym: I basically just told everyone.

1129
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:23,139
Rym: Yeah, you talk to him.

1130
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:23,910
Rym: You hate him.

1131
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:24,477
Rym: You kill him.

1132
00:56:24,498 --> 00:56:25,390
Rym: And I don't know.

1133
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:27,490
Rym: It's just because most of the people in this game don't know me that well.

1134
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:29,329
Rym: Everyone took my advice.

1135
00:56:30,411 --> 00:56:32,207
Rym: Everyone did exactly what I told them to do.

1136
00:56:32,872 --> 00:56:33,496
Scott: Good job.

1137
00:56:33,939 --> 00:56:38,390
Rym: And it came to this climactic moment where I whip out a sword and go to betray the guy I'm with.

1138
00:56:38,793 --> 00:56:40,130
Rym: If I kill him, I'm not going to get the inheritance.

1139
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:41,409
Rym: Like I basically would fuck everything up.

1140
00:56:41,812 --> 00:56:44,730
Rym: I put a sword to his throat and I threatened his life in front of his dad.

1141
00:56:45,571 --> 00:56:46,439
Rym: And I waited.

1142
00:56:46,681 --> 00:56:47,609
Rym: I was totally bluffing.

1143
00:56:48,191 --> 00:56:48,810
Rym: You know what happened?

1144
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,230
Rym: Everybody fucking stabbed each other all at once.

1145
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:53,410
Rym: And I was standing there alone and alive.

1146
00:56:54,191 --> 00:57:00,229
Rym: So when you watch the time lapse, you're going to see like 20 or 30 frames of everyone sitting around a table while the will is being read.

1147
00:57:00,914 --> 00:57:08,809
Rym: One frame of everyone standing up suddenly with all the chairs like thrown to the ground, one with everyone standing with swords through each other's throats, and then one with everyone dead but me.

1148
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:11,490
Rym: And I'm standing there going, why did you do this?

1149
00:57:11,571 --> 00:57:12,649
Rym: You stupid people.

1150
00:57:14,232 --> 00:57:20,110
Scott: It was the greatest experience of my life to put together the time lapse such that, you know, some frames last longer than others.

1151
00:57:20,773 --> 00:57:21,990
Rym: It is it is brilliant.

1152
00:57:22,352 --> 00:57:27,690
Rym: And if you ever get a chance to play Luke Crane's Inheritance LARP, it will be a peak role playing experience for you.

1153
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:30,350
Rym: However, it is brutal to play.

1154
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:40,470
Rym: You've got to be 100 percent without exception in character for a full two and a half to three hours in a room with eight other people who are also role playing in the same capacity.

1155
00:57:40,836 --> 00:57:41,689
Rym: There is no break.

1156
00:57:42,032 --> 00:57:42,890
Rym: There is no delay.

1157
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:45,189
Rym: And there are only three scenes.

1158
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:48,150
Rym: It was it was exhausting.

1159
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:55,041
Scott: So while you were playing in that game, I was playing in a game of Dungeoneers.

1160
00:57:57,692 --> 00:57:58,196
Scott: Oh, right.

1161
00:57:58,237 --> 00:57:59,930
Scott: You hadn't played that before.

1162
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:06,470
Scott: So if you don't know, this game is a somewhat maybe going to be official, something modification of Mouseguard.

1163
00:58:06,751 --> 00:58:10,749
Rym: Yeah, when I played it last time, they basically were like, yeah, don't really talk about it and don't record it.

1164
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:11,939
Scott: No one said anything to me.

1165
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:12,810
Rym: Yeah, so go nuts.

1166
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:14,689
Scott: So if they you know, that's not my problem.

1167
00:58:15,831 --> 00:58:17,690
Scott: So basically what it and it was on the schedule.

1168
00:58:18,011 --> 00:58:19,265
Scott: Just people know the game exists.

1169
00:58:19,286 --> 00:58:19,650
Scott: I don't care.

1170
00:58:19,991 --> 00:58:28,250
Scott: So it's basically it's a modified mouse guard that is basically just for straight up dungeon crawling in the old school D&D way.

1171
00:58:28,732 --> 00:58:29,745
Scott: But it is rough.

1172
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:35,390
Scott: It is like, wow, you are struggling the whole time because it's mouse guard.

1173
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,070
Scott: You're struggling to get checks.

1174
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:39,710
Scott: You're struggling to succeed at fucking anything.

1175
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:41,870
Scott: But he's struggling not to just get killed.

1176
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:45,810
Rym: You're struggling when you finally get the loot to fit it in your goddamn backpack.

1177
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:46,431
Scott: Yeah.

1178
00:58:46,471 --> 00:58:52,710
Scott: Anything you do, you know, gives you, you know, statuses like, you know, oh, I'm now I'm angry.

1179
00:58:53,012 --> 00:58:54,490
Scott: No, no, I'm exhausted.

1180
00:58:54,791 --> 00:58:59,290
Scott: Oh, and I'm sick and I'm and it just brings you down so hard.

1181
00:58:59,712 --> 00:59:02,290
Scott: And you need to earn checks to get it to get it back.

1182
00:59:02,732 --> 00:59:05,250
Scott: But you can't earn checks that easily.

1183
00:59:05,472 --> 00:59:07,810
Scott: And then, you know, we had really bad stuff happen.

1184
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:12,610
Scott: Like I think at one point, like everyone was got like tired simultaneously.

1185
00:59:13,292 --> 00:59:16,168
Scott: It was like, oh, no, everyone got hungry simultaneously.

1186
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:22,690
Rym: So it's got with three exceptions, all games in the schedule, had a number of players, four players, five players, nine players.

1187
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:25,969
Rym: One mouse guard game had guard mice instead of players.

1188
00:59:26,712 --> 00:59:29,410
Rym: One game had brave souls instead of players.

1189
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:34,290
Rym: And the Dungeoneers and Dragonslayers that you played had five greedy fools.

1190
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:36,006
Scott: That is what it had indeed.

1191
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:44,150
Scott: So the five greedy fools went into this dungeon and tried to get as much loot as possible and get out.

1192
00:59:44,632 --> 00:59:48,369
Scott: Little bit less role playing, a little bit more dungeoning going on here.

1193
00:59:49,912 --> 00:59:51,784
Scott: But really, this game was just.

1194
00:59:51,844 --> 00:59:57,790
Scott: I mean, if you think, you know, I've complained about brutal games like, say, FTL or Ninja Gay Day.

1195
00:59:59,473 --> 01:00:00,930
Scott: This was brutal.

1196
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:09,870
Scott: Not only do you struggle not to die, but the inventory Tetris is worse than any inventory Tetris I've ever played.

1197
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:13,510
Scott: We even had a bag of holding and it's effectively a bag of holding.

1198
01:00:13,813 --> 01:00:15,350
Scott: And it's still fucking sucked.

1199
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:16,790
Scott: We could not fit the shit.

1200
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:21,049
Scott: We had to dump the coins out of the bag of holding to put other shit in there.

1201
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:24,010
Scott: And then we just like left a pile of coins there.

1202
01:00:24,393 --> 01:00:25,850
Scott: And then like I had a two handed sack.

1203
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:28,290
Scott: But to use the two handed sack, I had the large sack.

1204
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:29,887
Scott: I mean, I had to carry it.

1205
01:00:30,832 --> 01:00:33,190
Scott: I had to carry the large sack in both hands.

1206
01:00:33,513 --> 01:00:34,909
Scott: I had a two handed sword.

1207
01:00:35,371 --> 01:00:37,245
Scott: Thank you, character maker.

1208
01:00:37,265 --> 01:00:37,366
Scott: Right.

1209
01:00:38,151 --> 01:00:39,390
Scott: Which means I had a small.

1210
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:41,950
Rym: You realize he was cackling while he made those characters.

1211
01:00:42,051 --> 01:00:44,650
Scott: I had to drop every time I need to stab something.

1212
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:50,690
Scott: I had to put the two the sack on Jersey, drop this sack that was in my other hand to hold the sword with two hands.

1213
01:00:50,992 --> 01:00:52,829
Scott: And after the fight, pick the sack up again.

1214
01:00:53,231 --> 01:00:57,569
Scott: But to use the large sack, I had to throw away the small sack and the sword.

1215
01:00:59,631 --> 01:01:03,604
Scott: Because there's nowhere to put them in the inventory slots because of how many slots they take up.

1216
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:07,810
Rym: Inventory Tetris is one of those weird mechanics.

1217
01:01:07,971 --> 01:01:09,390
Rym: And for whatever reason, just gets me going.

1218
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:09,714
Rym: Yeah.

1219
01:01:09,735 --> 01:01:10,768
Scott: And it's like we go in.

1220
01:01:11,174 --> 01:01:12,230
Scott: We got all these treasures.

1221
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:13,615
Scott: We carry them.

1222
01:01:13,655 --> 01:01:15,830
Scott: We figure out how to between us, carry them all.

1223
01:01:16,191 --> 01:01:19,550
Scott: And then we had to leave and we had to leave a bunch of stuff behind.

1224
01:01:20,532 --> 01:01:23,690
Scott: And it's like, you know, you play Oregon Trail and you kill all the buffalo.

1225
01:01:24,114 --> 01:01:25,249
Scott: And then it says, sorry, good.

1226
01:01:25,652 --> 01:01:27,385
Scott: You only get to carry back 200 pounds of meat.

1227
01:01:28,991 --> 01:01:33,250
Scott: This is like, yo, dude, you killed two thousand pounds of meat.

1228
01:01:33,692 --> 01:01:35,986
Scott: You get to carry back five of those pounds.

1229
01:01:36,207 --> 01:01:36,549
Scott: Yeah.

1230
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:38,786
Scott: And I just like you want to kill some.

1231
01:01:38,806 --> 01:01:39,048
Scott: Yeah.

1232
01:01:39,874 --> 01:01:42,070
Rym: Oh, and you're tired now because you spent the day shooting.

1233
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:42,451
Rym: Oh, yeah.

1234
01:01:42,471 --> 01:01:44,930
Scott: By the way, minus two D to all rolls.

1235
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:48,210
Scott: And if you want to get some of those rolls back, you could drink some wine.

1236
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:49,469
Rym: So it's got some food.

1237
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:50,213
Scott: But guess what?

1238
01:01:50,253 --> 01:01:52,970
Scott: If you eat the drink, the wine, it only empties your wine skin.

1239
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:54,529
Scott: And it's not like you can put coins in there.

1240
01:01:54,852 --> 01:01:56,650
Scott: So it doesn't help you to clear out the inventory.

1241
01:01:56,830 --> 01:01:57,730
Rym: So correct me if I'm wrong.

1242
01:01:57,770 --> 01:02:03,570
Rym: But when I played this last time in Mouse Guard, you get one free check and you only have to earn extras.

1243
01:02:03,991 --> 01:02:05,869
Rym: When I played this, you didn't get any free checks.

1244
01:02:06,572 --> 01:02:10,857
Scott: It is true that in Mouse Guard, everybody gets a free check.

1245
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:16,984
Scott: every time it is the player's turn in dungeoneers and whatever.

1246
01:02:17,004 --> 01:02:17,104
Scott: Right.

1247
01:02:19,594 --> 01:02:21,310
Scott: You get no checks at all.

1248
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:24,990
Scott: You need to earn every check that you use, but you can share checks.

1249
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:29,868
Scott: So when I had two checks, I gave checks to some other people who really needed them when I did not need them.

1250
01:02:31,315 --> 01:02:31,828
Scott: And vice versa.

1251
01:02:32,271 --> 01:02:34,923
Rym: So so I should clarify one thing.

1252
01:02:34,963 --> 01:02:36,510
Rym: in the LARP, I said I didn't kill anyone.

1253
01:02:37,331 --> 01:02:40,610
Rym: So it's kind of an inside joke and almost no one will get it.

1254
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:41,250
Rym: So the people are there.

1255
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:44,930
Rym: So Vincent Baker himself played the priest and the will was read.

1256
01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:50,109
Rym: And basically, people of the swords turned to the priest and said, you should leave.

1257
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:51,850
Rym: Here's a bag of gold for your troubles.

1258
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:53,829
Rym: Walk quickly on the road and hope we don't catch up.

1259
01:02:54,571 --> 01:03:00,784
Rym: So Vincent Baker, being the constant role player, decided that he won and said, see you and exited the game with a pile of gold.

1260
01:03:01,428 --> 01:03:01,770
Scott: Nice.

1261
01:03:02,171 --> 01:03:09,069
Rym: At the very end of the game, when I'm the last man standing, I go to the crazy witch played by her friend Cat Gefion, the crazy witch I played last time.

1262
01:03:09,491 --> 01:03:13,010
Rym: And she's like, you can't marry my daughter unless you actually worship Thor.

1263
01:03:13,591 --> 01:03:17,270
Rym: Which is tricky because I had claimed to be baptized like nine times.

1264
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:18,230
Rym: All the story shenanigans.

1265
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:20,890
Rym: So I was like, I will go murder that priest.

1266
01:03:21,071 --> 01:03:24,050
Rym: I will catch up to him on the road and bring you back a bag of gold and his head.

1267
01:03:24,392 --> 01:03:28,883
Rym: And Vincent Baker, who'd been sitting there like enjoying the denim out of the game, turns to me and says, really?

1268
01:03:28,903 --> 01:03:29,748
Scott: Really?

1269
01:03:30,913 --> 01:03:32,410
Rym: And then looks like we're going to play this out.

1270
01:03:32,531 --> 01:03:34,669
Scott: To prove that you worship Thor.

1271
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:37,369
Rym: So the Ukraine made us play it out.

1272
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:39,923
Rym: So the final scene was he.

1273
01:03:40,003 --> 01:03:53,410
Rym: it was like a month later, he was like getting on a boat to go to the new world and he had this bag of money and I was going, well, I show up in his house and I'm just like, so nothing, no offense to you or your God if he answers your prayers.

1274
01:03:53,953 --> 01:03:57,309
Rym: But I'm going to kill you and take your head and give it back to that crazy witch so I can marry her daughter.

1275
01:03:58,451 --> 01:04:03,989
Rym: And he looks at me and I say, make whatever rituals you have to make, and then I'm going to come back to the room and kill you.

1276
01:04:04,612 --> 01:04:05,610
Rym: And it's Vincent Baker.

1277
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:07,229
Rym: So I'm curious how he's going to role play this.

1278
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:09,428
Rym: He fucking tried to stab me.

1279
01:04:10,932 --> 01:04:14,346
Rym: The priest at the very end had had enough of this Viking bullshit and tried to kill me.

1280
01:04:15,091 --> 01:04:15,292
Rym: All right.

1281
01:04:15,533 --> 01:04:21,769
Rym: So the mechanic Luke had for this was if you actually tried to kill someone, you had an envelope and he never told you what it was the whole time.

1282
01:04:22,232 --> 01:04:23,110
Rym: You try to kill someone.

1283
01:04:23,372 --> 01:04:29,029
Rym: You open your envelope and you find the name of the person you tried to kill and it tells you the results.

1284
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:30,594
Scott: Mm hmm.

1285
01:04:30,956 --> 01:04:33,429
Rym: So it's basically as though you'd pre-rolled all the roles.

1286
01:04:34,431 --> 01:04:45,630
Rym: So he looks like, well, open your envelope and look up Arvandale's name and Vincent Baker dutifully opens the envelope, looks at it and says and looks at it and goes, well, that was expected.

1287
01:04:46,492 --> 01:04:50,958
Scott: Well, your character was the big, strong, dangerous guy, the baddest of all.

1288
01:04:51,522 --> 01:04:52,430
Scott: Is it bodyguard?

1289
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:57,129
Scott: So I imagine on most people's sheets, it said if they fought you, that you would win.

1290
01:04:57,673 --> 01:04:58,960
Rym: I also had the best instinct ever.

1291
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,026
Rym: Always look for trouble.

1292
01:05:00,589 --> 01:05:00,790
Scott: Great.

1293
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:09,370
Rym: So when we were talking about we had this whole like rap session at the end and I was like, I won and I didn't kill a single person.

1294
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:12,429
Rym: And Vincent looks at me and says, what the fuck?

1295
01:05:15,731 --> 01:05:20,266
Scott: OK, so there's besides the sessions that we ran as is a law of burning.

1296
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:22,462
Rym: My game went OK.

1297
01:05:22,624 --> 01:05:23,049
Rym: Wasn't great.

1298
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:24,550
Rym: I was there as well as I could.

1299
01:05:25,111 --> 01:05:26,505
Scott: There was one more session.

1300
01:05:26,545 --> 01:05:27,050
Scott: I played it.

1301
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,050
Scott: And as you know, there was a beginner track.

1302
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:29,434
Rym: One more.

1303
01:05:29,495 --> 01:05:30,005
Rym: I had two more.

1304
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:32,160
Rym: One, two.

1305
01:05:32,443 --> 01:05:33,090
Rym: You missed the game.

1306
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:35,870
Scott: Engineers, am I missing a game?

1307
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:38,970
Rym: Because I played in a zombie apocalypse game and like modern burning wheel.

1308
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:39,414
Rym: It was a hack.

1309
01:05:39,434 --> 01:05:39,757
Rym: It was OK.

1310
01:05:39,939 --> 01:05:40,950
Scott: Let me see that schedule.

1311
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:49,707
Rym: It was pretty fun, but I don't have anything notable to say about it, except that I died and I died taking, I think, a G-16 wound.

1312
01:05:52,071 --> 01:05:52,372
Scott: Let's see.

1313
01:05:52,413 --> 01:05:59,470
Scott: I played in Rachel's game, Matt's game, Dungeoneer game, the beginner track game I was about to talk about, and then I ran my game.

1314
01:05:59,610 --> 01:05:59,955
Scott: That's five.

1315
01:05:59,975 --> 01:06:01,110
Scott: Oh, all right.

1316
01:06:01,471 --> 01:06:01,814
Scott: All right.

1317
01:06:01,834 --> 01:06:03,310
Scott: So the beginner track.

1318
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:03,651
Scott: Right.

1319
01:06:03,691 --> 01:06:08,130
Scott: So this burning con featured a new feature, featured a new feature, the beginner track.

1320
01:06:08,210 --> 01:06:17,390
Scott: If you had not GM before, you could do the beginner's course on Saturday and then you would be required to run a game that you just been trained to run on Sunday.

1321
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:28,550
Scott: So being all adventurous and also, you know, wanting to sort of walk the walk and say, hey, look, you know, I always say people can't learn to be GMs because they need when they suck.

1322
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:29,809
Scott: No one wants to play in their games.

1323
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:32,310
Scott: They can't practice and get better because no one wants to play.

1324
01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:34,308
Scott: So they and it's sort of catch twenty two.

1325
01:06:34,732 --> 01:06:36,589
Scott: I said, I'm going to go play in a beginner track game.

1326
01:06:37,671 --> 01:06:45,188
Scott: So I went and actually the GM of this beginner track game was one of our listeners and the game he ran was not too bad.

1327
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:47,031
Rym: All right.

1328
01:06:47,736 --> 01:06:50,070
Rym: Last game I played was something I never played before.

1329
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:51,606
Scott: I'm trying to remember what happened in it.

1330
01:06:52,496 --> 01:06:53,184
Rym: I played the schedule.

1331
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:56,229
Rym: I played in Ajit's Lady Blackbird game.

1332
01:06:56,951 --> 01:06:56,992
Scott: OK.

1333
01:06:57,012 --> 01:06:58,470
Rym: Do you know anything about Lady Blackbird?

1334
01:06:58,610 --> 01:07:00,069
Scott: I'm still not bringing up the schedule about me.

1335
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:03,290
Scott: Oh, you need the schedule that I can't remember what the game was about.

1336
01:07:03,431 --> 01:07:04,200
Rym: I only pull it back up.

1337
01:07:04,241 --> 01:07:04,950
Rym: I got the schedule around.

1338
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:06,990
Scott: I have heard people talk about Lady Blackbird.

1339
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:19,929
Scott: And all I know is that it is a game where that is, quote, easy to GM because the players do not have to do so much.

1340
01:07:20,412 --> 01:07:21,029
Rym: So here's the deal.

1341
01:07:21,432 --> 01:07:24,529
Rym: Lady Blackbird is steampunk, the role playing game.

1342
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:28,188
Rym: And the way it works, as far as I can tell, is you have traits.

1343
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:30,570
Rym: And under each trait, you have a bunch of things.

1344
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:33,170
Rym: Your character will see something like cunning and under cunning.

1345
01:07:33,271 --> 01:07:35,349
Rym: It has like six or seven other descriptors.

1346
01:07:37,612 --> 01:07:41,550
Rym: You can if you want to accomplish something, it's burning wheel style obstacles.

1347
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:43,650
Rym: You know, one, two, three or four, five, six success or failure.

1348
01:07:44,391 --> 01:07:46,359
Rym: So what you do is you choose.

1349
01:07:46,419 --> 01:07:48,970
Rym: you get one die because you're a person.

1350
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:49,432
Rym: You're you.

1351
01:07:50,095 --> 01:07:57,030
Rym: You get one die for the trait you use and you get one die for every one of those aspects that you also are using and attempting to accomplish something.

1352
01:07:57,671 --> 01:07:58,730
Rym: And then you're given an obstacle.

1353
01:08:00,171 --> 01:08:03,310
Rym: And that's the primary core mechanic of the game.

1354
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:06,309
Rym: Now, to augment that, you have a pool of seven dice.

1355
01:08:07,111 --> 01:08:09,049
Rym: You can draw from that pool at any time.

1356
01:08:10,071 --> 01:08:14,390
Rym: If you fail the roll, you get all those dice back and an extra die to the pool.

1357
01:08:15,232 --> 01:08:19,210
Rym: If you succeed at the roll, you lose all the dice you pulled from the pool.

1358
01:08:20,590 --> 01:08:24,933
Rym: So basically, the more you fail, you build up this buffer of eventually succeeding and being awesome.

1359
01:08:24,953 --> 01:08:30,130
Rym: Yeah, though oftentimes you keep failing roles because you keep trying to do increasingly desperate things.

1360
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:31,870
Rym: But when you succeed, you're back to nothing.

1361
01:08:32,050 --> 01:08:33,410
Scott: So it's sort of like an inverse dread.

1362
01:08:34,149 --> 01:08:35,189
Rym: So it is one other mechanic.

1363
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:35,988
Rym: It's very inspector.

1364
01:08:36,892 --> 01:08:50,090
Rym: If you want to refresh your pool, you can call for an aside and you basically do the equivalent of turning to another player character and say, yeah, this is just like that time we did the whatever and then role play a flashback like Arabian Nights.

1365
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:50,692
Rym: Yeah.

1366
01:08:50,993 --> 01:08:53,089
Rym: Or like inspectors with the asides.

1367
01:08:54,430 --> 01:09:00,389
Rym: It basically is a role playing heavy game and the dice just come out every now and then to decide if you succeed or fail.

1368
01:09:01,229 --> 01:09:03,649
Rym: Succeeding means you get what you want and the plot progresses.

1369
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:06,850
Rym: Failure just increasingly makes things desperate.

1370
01:09:07,353 --> 01:09:09,089
Rym: And the ship is also a character.

1371
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:11,969
Rym: It's really, really fun.

1372
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:18,710
Rym: I played Lady Blackbird, of course, and I was told that I took a very interesting take on Lady Blackbird and the game turned into romantic comedy.

1373
01:09:19,109 --> 01:09:20,090
Rym: I ended up dating the captain.

1374
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:20,893
Scott: Okay.

1375
01:09:21,314 --> 01:09:24,410
Rym: Also, Lady Blackbirds, the consummate badass and also a wizard.

1376
01:09:25,051 --> 01:09:25,517
Scott: Okay.

1377
01:09:25,558 --> 01:09:26,450
Scott: In a steampunk setting.

1378
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:29,870
Rym: So I was like trying to use lightning to take out the security cameras.

1379
01:09:30,130 --> 01:09:32,310
Scott: The setting sounds a little bit fan service.

1380
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:39,029
Rym: Now, you know, the setting is an endless blue sky with a dying star in the middle of it and a bunch of landmass.

1381
01:09:39,229 --> 01:09:40,380
Scott: How is that not fan service?

1382
01:09:40,501 --> 01:09:41,569
Rym: and a bunch of land masses?

1383
01:09:41,971 --> 01:09:46,933
Rym: The ships are all airships, the evil empires, kind of like Star Wars, the Thrawny kind of people.

1384
01:09:46,953 --> 01:09:48,370
Scott: Again, how is it not fanservice?

1385
01:09:48,571 --> 01:09:50,049
Rym: And remember, we played Air Action Weekly.

1386
01:09:50,529 --> 01:09:51,377
Rym: It kind of has this.

1387
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:52,850
Rym: Yeah, there's a radio channel.

1388
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:54,529
Rym: Fucking everyone in the entire world can hear it.

1389
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:55,749
Rym: Yeah, it was great.

1390
01:09:56,810 --> 01:09:57,414
Scott: I'm remembering.

1391
01:09:57,434 --> 01:10:00,330
Rym: It is also one of the better game masters I've ever played with.

1392
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:00,954
Scott: Oh, yeah.

1393
01:10:01,117 --> 01:10:01,830
Scott: I talked to him a bunch.

1394
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:04,329
Rym: He is super cool and he's super good at this.

1395
01:10:04,851 --> 01:10:07,710
Rym: And some people from Inheritance were around in this game, too.

1396
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:11,532
Scott: And I got to say, I actually talked to him at the party and he said he was like a relative nub.

1397
01:10:11,552 --> 01:10:16,180
Rym: And I was like, well, the thing is, Lady Blackbird, he has not played most of these indie RPGs.

1398
01:10:16,302 --> 01:10:16,970
Rym: I felt bad.

1399
01:10:17,191 --> 01:10:20,170
Rym: I was the one who booted him out of Inheritance.

1400
01:10:22,073 --> 01:10:25,010
Rym: But he the all you have to do to run Lady Blackbird is know how the rules work.

1401
01:10:25,412 --> 01:10:29,374
Rym: And every time a character says something, just turn to any other character and say, how do you feel about that?

1402
01:10:30,299 --> 01:10:32,290
Rym: How do you feel about you're a you're a noble?

1403
01:10:32,410 --> 01:10:34,769
Rym: How do you feel about how the captain just kind of overruled you?

1404
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:38,049
Rym: Captain, how do you feel that this noble just overruled you?

1405
01:10:38,592 --> 01:10:42,589
Rym: No matter if I said something or he said something, he just turned to the other person and said, how do you feel about that?

1406
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:44,130
Scott: Yeah, it's a luke crane trick.

1407
01:10:44,591 --> 01:10:45,929
Scott: You probably learned that in the beginner's track.

1408
01:10:46,172 --> 01:10:47,210
Rym: It works really well.

1409
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:48,690
Scott: You definitely learn that beginner's track, maybe.

1410
01:10:48,890 --> 01:10:55,913
Scott: OK, so the the game I played in with the Nub GM, it was this sort of typical Burning Wheel scenario.

1411
01:10:56,114 --> 01:11:01,310
Scott: And the situation was that there was a tomb, right?

1412
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:06,570
Scott: And someone like the, you know, like the Lord's son had recently passed away.

1413
01:11:06,712 --> 01:11:08,008
Scott: But we don't know why.

1414
01:11:08,531 --> 01:11:09,215
Scott: And he was.

1415
01:11:09,476 --> 01:11:11,809
Scott: he was in the tomb waiting.

1416
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:12,651
Scott: Right.

1417
01:11:12,731 --> 01:11:17,270
Scott: We were the grave robbers and we were going to go rob that grave.

1418
01:11:18,112 --> 01:11:20,530
Scott: And each of us had different reasons for wanting to rob the grave.

1419
01:11:20,751 --> 01:11:21,033
Scott: Right.

1420
01:11:21,355 --> 01:11:23,530
Scott: Some of us wanted to get in and out fast with treasure.

1421
01:11:24,031 --> 01:11:27,130
Scott: Some of us wanted to get the body and bring it out.

1422
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:30,770
Scott: Some of us wanted to, you know, keep the body in there.

1423
01:11:30,971 --> 01:11:39,174
Scott: And because there was a sorceress who was also coming to get the body, but we got there first and my character wanted to wait till she got there to negotiate with her and all this stuff.

1424
01:11:39,195 --> 01:11:40,448
Scott: And there was something creepy going on.

1425
01:11:41,392 --> 01:11:45,130
Scott: And then it became a zombie situation where the dead were rising all over the place.

1426
01:11:45,331 --> 01:11:48,070
Scott: And then we're all confronting the sorceress at her palace.

1427
01:11:48,452 --> 01:11:52,670
Scott: And, you know, this sort of typical town goes nuts.

1428
01:11:53,011 --> 01:11:54,310
Scott: There's something supernatural going.

1429
01:11:54,692 --> 01:11:56,349
Scott: How did this guy even die?

1430
01:11:56,830 --> 01:11:59,099
Scott: What is the Lord Duke up to?

1431
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:15,769
Scott: kind of situation, you know, with a lot and the character conflict is pretty good, too, because it's all like, you know, the other guy just wanted to, you know, just like destroy the body or something, whereas I was like, no, no, no, we need to, you know, wait here for the sorceress to show up.

1432
01:12:16,213 --> 01:12:17,548
Scott: But I didn't say that.

1433
01:12:18,091 --> 01:12:23,075
Scott: And I was, you know, I was trying to yeah, I was trying to delay by like letting the thievy people.

1434
01:12:23,135 --> 01:12:25,510
Scott: I was like, yeah, let these guys steal some more treasure.

1435
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:27,769
Scott: Hey, maybe there's another room with more treasure to steal.

1436
01:12:28,292 --> 01:12:29,449
Scott: Yeah, let's go, you know.

1437
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:31,730
Scott: And he's like, no, no, we got to get out of here now.

1438
01:12:31,770 --> 01:12:33,470
Scott: And I'm like, no, let's steal some more treasure.

1439
01:12:33,571 --> 01:12:34,809
Scott: Look, there's all this gold here.

1440
01:12:35,174 --> 01:12:36,229
Scott: It was fake gold.

1441
01:12:37,413 --> 01:12:39,650
Scott: It was, you know, it was it for enough GM.

1442
01:12:39,931 --> 01:12:41,609
Scott: He did rather well.

1443
01:12:42,051 --> 01:12:48,030
Scott: And he was also very enthusiastic about, you know, doing better the next time.

1444
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:52,190
Scott: And all the devices that people were throwing out, he was like, oh, and writing it down.

1445
01:12:52,350 --> 01:13:04,070
Scott: So I definitely feel that the beginner track was very helpful and that those people that you were beginners now at future burning cons will become Matt's and Rachel's of the future.

1446
01:13:04,272 --> 01:13:05,869
Scott: And you will want to sign up for their games.

1447
01:13:06,552 --> 01:13:08,590
Rym: There were some high caliber role players.

1448
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:14,092
Rym: I mean, during inheritance, multiple characters broke out into legitimate tears in the course of the game.

1449
01:13:14,494 --> 01:13:20,069
Rym: People like when the will was being read, Vincent had this quiver in his voice when a certain fact was revealed.

1450
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:21,948
Scott: And it was the fact that I know.

1451
01:13:22,472 --> 01:13:24,530
Rym: Yeah, you know, that same fact is the same fact.

1452
01:13:24,812 --> 01:13:26,990
Rym: It's a little more nuanced because of some other bullshit.

1453
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:32,570
Scott: But let's just say, well, because well, because his character is reading it right.

1454
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:37,185
Scott: Whereas the character that I played, the dwarf with the runes and he reads, he was like, oh, these fucking humans.

1455
01:13:37,245 --> 01:13:37,530
Scott: Right.

1456
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:44,975
Scott: But if that guy reads that will not knowing the content, Luke made us pass the will around to check the seal.

1457
01:13:44,995 --> 01:13:47,935
Rym: So everyone held it physically in their hand and had a real seal with wax.

1458
01:13:48,118 --> 01:13:48,910
Rym: No, he didn't have a real sale.

1459
01:13:48,990 --> 01:13:50,670
Scott: Basically, we were like a piece of scotch tape.

1460
01:13:50,931 --> 01:13:57,650
Rym: There were a lot of great moments, like when the prodigal son came, he went to put like a burning brand into the fire of the grandfather.

1461
01:13:58,130 --> 01:14:01,330
Rym: And Kat, who was playing Geffian, fucking knocked it out of his hand.

1462
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:01,872
Scott: Nice.

1463
01:14:01,892 --> 01:14:04,089
Rym: It was that it was so peak.

1464
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:05,513
Scott: That was peak.

1465
01:14:06,255 --> 01:14:10,915
Scott: So the final thing to talk about is the session that I ran or the session that you ran.

1466
01:14:10,935 --> 01:14:12,450
Scott: But you didn't seem like you want to talk about it very much.

1467
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:14,009
Rym: I could just we've already gone for over an hour.

1468
01:14:14,371 --> 01:14:16,790
Scott: OK, well, let me quickly just say this about the session I ran.

1469
01:14:17,214 --> 01:14:18,249
Scott: It was the last session.

1470
01:14:18,672 --> 01:14:20,229
Scott: A lot of people weren't there because of Hurricane.

1471
01:14:20,851 --> 01:14:24,249
Scott: I thought there might be no players and I could go home and watch football, which was.

1472
01:14:24,269 --> 01:14:27,010
Scott: I did get home for the end of the game, which is aggravating.

1473
01:14:28,850 --> 01:14:35,076
Scott: And at first I only had one player who was the beginner GM listener who really wanted to play in my game.

1474
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:36,509
Scott: He told me so, but no one else was in.

1475
01:14:37,151 --> 01:14:44,112
Scott: Then I got a second player and then out of which was, you know, no, then the second player left.

1476
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:48,955
Scott: And I'm sitting here thinking football, football, because I wasn't you know, I was confident in my session.

1477
01:14:48,995 --> 01:14:53,530
Scott: I had increased in confidence, but my level of confidence in it had wavered over time.

1478
01:14:53,550 --> 01:14:56,889
Rym: But funnily, there were three games in the room and every GM was like, well, I'm OK.

1479
01:14:57,310 --> 01:15:01,270
Scott: And the confidence that I had in my game was not at the maximum.

1480
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:01,733
Scott: So I was.

1481
01:15:01,955 --> 01:15:03,730
Scott: I was glad not to run.

1482
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:04,091
Scott: Right.

1483
01:15:04,573 --> 01:15:07,670
Scott: Then suddenly Lou Crane appears to play in my game.

1484
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:08,688
Scott: And I'm like, oh, fuck no.

1485
01:15:10,690 --> 01:15:11,376
Scott: Fuck no.

1486
01:15:11,416 --> 01:15:12,869
Scott: So then I go into the second room.

1487
01:15:13,052 --> 01:15:13,274
Scott: Right.

1488
01:15:13,315 --> 01:15:14,449
Scott: He's like, well, we're going to play.

1489
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:17,050
Scott: And suddenly I'm running the game with Lou Crane and I'm like, shit.

1490
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:19,369
Scott: Suddenly we go into the second room.

1491
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:22,690
Scott: He bails on the game and I'm like, yes, all right.

1492
01:15:23,116 --> 01:15:24,090
Scott: And income Shervin.

1493
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:25,449
Scott: And I was like, Shervin, what's up?

1494
01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:26,013
Scott: All right.

1495
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:28,370
Scott: You know, so now I got, you know, listener and I got Shervin.

1496
01:15:28,450 --> 01:15:37,035
Scott: And then almost almost as bad as Lou Crane, but not quite as bad incomes, John and Lamar, who are.

1497
01:15:37,357 --> 01:15:38,386
Scott: And I'm like, oh, crap.

1498
01:15:39,111 --> 01:15:42,770
Scott: What am I going to do now with these expert role players stepping into my game?

1499
01:15:43,051 --> 01:15:47,050
Scott: This is not good in a scenario where I do not have full confidence.

1500
01:15:47,131 --> 01:15:48,790
Scott: I've never even run a practice run.

1501
01:15:49,172 --> 01:15:50,099
Scott: I've never done anything.

1502
01:15:50,119 --> 01:15:51,227
Scott: And I'm sitting there thinking, right.

1503
01:15:51,730 --> 01:15:54,209
Scott: Basically is the gist of my scenario that I came up with.

1504
01:15:55,013 --> 01:15:56,249
Scott: You're in a normal ass town.

1505
01:15:57,191 --> 01:16:00,450
Scott: There is a monster up in the hills, a legend of a monster up in the hills.

1506
01:16:00,591 --> 01:16:01,930
Scott: No one knows if it's really there or not.

1507
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:04,070
Scott: But the legend is, you know, don't go in the cave.

1508
01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:05,089
Scott: No one's ever returned.

1509
01:16:05,552 --> 01:16:07,590
Scott: If you go near it, there's weird noises, that whole thing.

1510
01:16:08,450 --> 01:16:12,890
Scott: The night, the night, like Lancelot, famous night throughout the realm shows up.

1511
01:16:13,010 --> 01:16:15,450
Scott: He says, I'm going to take care of this monster everyone's heard about.

1512
01:16:15,770 --> 01:16:16,453
Scott: He goes off.

1513
01:16:17,478 --> 01:16:19,970
Scott: You the players are for normal as townsfolk.

1514
01:16:20,171 --> 01:16:22,510
Scott: The innkeeper, the steadfast innkeeper.

1515
01:16:22,970 --> 01:16:23,071
Scott: Right.

1516
01:16:23,091 --> 01:16:25,049
Scott: You know, the one that's the MPC in all the video games.

1517
01:16:25,610 --> 01:16:30,690
Scott: The bard who plays music in the inn, the town drunk who is a shopkeeper.

1518
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:38,570
Scott: and a foreign merchant who has a caravan that is in town and is sort of, you know, the innkeeper doesn't like it because, you know, business competition.

1519
01:16:39,371 --> 01:16:43,530
Scott: So these are the four normal, boring as weak as normal townsfolk.

1520
01:16:44,571 --> 01:16:49,630
Scott: And the story is the night returns to the inn while all the four players are in it.

1521
01:16:49,670 --> 01:16:53,850
Scott: And he's wounded, but he's carrying mad loot, big time loot.

1522
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:54,352
Scott: Right.

1523
01:16:54,392 --> 01:16:58,334
Scott: And I got this idea because the previous year I played in a game that was about.

1524
01:16:58,537 --> 01:16:59,669
Scott: I think we might have talked about it.

1525
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:03,730
Scott: The four players just killed the dragon and come to town with the loot.

1526
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:08,009
Scott: And I was thinking, what if the four players are normal people in the town and someone else comes in with the loot?

1527
01:17:08,351 --> 01:17:08,512
Scott: Right.

1528
01:17:08,533 --> 01:17:14,710
Scott: It's sort of the opposite instead of the players being the people, the loot, the players, people trying to get the loot from the player who is the night.

1529
01:17:15,232 --> 01:17:19,974
Scott: So, you know, I dropped these beliefs and these character sheets on these four people.

1530
01:17:20,055 --> 01:17:21,090
Scott: That's all I dropped on them.

1531
01:17:21,231 --> 01:17:22,630
Scott: I wasn't as prepared as Rachel.

1532
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:23,374
Scott: I wasn't right.

1533
01:17:23,898 --> 01:17:25,389
Scott: And I'm like, what am I going to do?

1534
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:26,393
Scott: What's going to happen?

1535
01:17:26,855 --> 01:17:33,410
Scott: And of course, expert role player John immediately before I could even make the I'm thinking, all right, we got to start the game.

1536
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:36,809
Scott: I got to make the night show up before I can even make the night show up.

1537
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:45,996
Scott: John goes full on with the singing, attacking the shopkeeper, trying to he hit in the first.

1538
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:51,310
Scott: he immediately begins the game and hits all his beliefs on a single role before anything has even happened.

1539
01:17:51,490 --> 01:17:56,529
Rym: I'm reminded of the moment way back when we first played the sword, when Luke came found us arguing and said, no, I'll go on.

1540
01:17:57,074 --> 01:17:58,470
Scott: That is exactly what occurred.

1541
01:17:59,571 --> 01:18:09,168
Scott: And actually, I started running this game and a lot of it I cannot deny a significant portion of it must have been due to the excellent skills of all.

1542
01:18:09,249 --> 01:18:12,350
Scott: four of the players at the table were a plus playing.

1543
01:18:12,611 --> 01:18:23,330
Scott: I could not ask for easier people to run a game for, but I was actually surprised looking at myself with the third person view at the quality of my game running.

1544
01:18:23,470 --> 01:18:25,670
Scott: I said, man, I wish I was playing in this game.

1545
01:18:26,113 --> 01:18:27,310
Scott: Why am I doing a good job?

1546
01:18:27,431 --> 01:18:29,289
Scott: I don't know, but I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing.

1547
01:18:29,530 --> 01:18:30,354
Scott: How is this happening?

1548
01:18:30,917 --> 01:18:35,669
Scott: So now I just kind of want to run this game for other people's because I feel good about running it.

1549
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:36,151
Rym: Yeah.

1550
01:18:36,412 --> 01:18:45,350
Scott: And I'm what I'm really wondering, though, could I run a campaign game that goes on as well as I was running that one time game?

1551
01:18:45,570 --> 01:18:46,296
Rym: You could try again.

1552
01:18:46,337 --> 01:18:47,850
Rym: We could try to do Dwarf Fortress again.

1553
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:49,370
Scott: But I don't know if we do Dwarf Fortress.

1554
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:50,159
Scott: We'll do something.

1555
01:18:50,301 --> 01:18:50,850
Rym: I like Dwarf Fortress.

1556
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:53,610
Scott: I really want to do townsfolk because I'm liking townsfolk.

1557
01:18:53,810 --> 01:18:55,270
Rym: I'm liking dwarves lately.

1558
01:18:56,054 --> 01:18:57,430
Scott: I like townsfolk.

1559
01:18:57,530 --> 01:18:58,097
Rym: Thing is, I'm playing.

1560
01:18:58,178 --> 01:18:59,130
Scott: it proves me right.

1561
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:03,694
Scott: That the thing I've always wanted to play was boring as townsfolk and I was able to make it work.

1562
01:19:04,237 --> 01:19:04,719
Scott: So it was.

1563
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,659
Scott: it was just like, yeah, no one else wanted to play boring townsfolk but me.

1564
01:19:07,801 --> 01:19:08,650
Scott: And look, I was right.

1565
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:10,329
Scott: Boring as townsfolk is a great game.

1566
01:19:11,031 --> 01:19:11,836
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

1567
01:19:13,204 --> 01:19:14,009
Rym: So fag.

1568
01:19:16,531 --> 01:19:18,746
Rym: Sadly, the after party, I did not go.

1569
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:20,235
Scott: I went to watch football.

1570
01:19:20,335 --> 01:19:27,933
Rym: I went to the after party and then I literally rode the last train out of Dodge because the hurricane was coming in and all the subways were closing down.

1571
01:19:28,274 --> 01:19:32,249
Rym: I got on the last train out of Manhattan, literally like the like.

1572
01:19:32,631 --> 01:19:34,190
Rym: we walk up and everything's roped off.

1573
01:19:34,230 --> 01:19:35,337
Rym: I'm like, fuck, did we miss it?

1574
01:19:36,002 --> 01:19:37,169
Rym: And then there's this crazy guy.

1575
01:19:37,574 --> 01:19:38,140
Rym: He wasn't crazy.

1576
01:19:38,161 --> 01:19:38,930
Rym: He was just one of those guys.

1577
01:19:39,171 --> 01:19:42,170
Rym: Anyone who talks to you in the subway who isn't an official is probably crazy.

1578
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:44,329
Rym: And he starts explaining what's going on.

1579
01:19:44,410 --> 01:19:50,130
Rym: But in a kind of crazy way and how it's the government conspiracy, like that's why the hurricane's coming in, why they're shutting everything down.

1580
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:50,674
Rym: But whatever.

1581
01:19:51,561 --> 01:19:52,510
Rym: So we wait.

1582
01:19:53,031 --> 01:20:02,130
Rym: And then sure enough, the last train out of Dodge pulls up and then the person in the booth turns off the light, locks the door to the booth, opens the exit door.

1583
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:03,378
Rym: We all walk through with her.

1584
01:20:03,499 --> 01:20:07,028
Rym: We all got on the train together and we left the subway station empty and the lights all turned off behind us.

1585
01:20:07,331 --> 01:20:09,010
Rym: Well, it was awesome.

1586
01:20:09,511 --> 01:20:14,270
Scott: So today on the subway, they're making all these announcements about the limited service and one of the announcements.

1587
01:20:14,430 --> 01:20:15,809
Scott: You know what the guy said on the train?

1588
01:20:17,053 --> 01:20:23,055
Scott: He said the end trains go to thirty fourth street where you can transfer to the BMT or IND.

1589
01:20:23,095 --> 01:20:23,338
Scott: Whoa.

1590
01:20:25,192 --> 01:20:32,130
Scott: And as soon as I heard that guy must be like as soon as I heard that, I was like, how old is the dude who is freaking running this train?

1591
01:20:32,191 --> 01:20:32,656
Scott: Because it's true.

1592
01:20:32,697 --> 01:20:33,750
Scott: The IRT wasn't running.

1593
01:20:33,973 --> 01:20:34,157
Scott: Yeah.

1594
01:20:34,545 --> 01:20:34,770
Scott: Right.

1595
01:20:35,051 --> 01:20:40,718
Scott: I was like, how old is the guy who is, you know, conducting this train or engineering this subway train?

1596
01:20:41,365 --> 01:20:41,890
Scott: That is epic.

1597
01:20:41,930 --> 01:20:42,738
Scott: He didn't say it again.

1598
01:20:42,759 --> 01:20:43,870
Scott: I kept listening to his announcement.

1599
01:20:44,896 --> 01:20:45,708
Scott: He only said it once.

1600
01:20:45,911 --> 01:20:47,029
Scott: He said BMT, IND.

1601
01:20:47,370 --> 01:20:49,630
Rym: And I was like, that's how you know if someone's actually an immortal.

1602
01:20:49,990 --> 01:20:50,231
Scott: And I was.

1603
01:20:50,252 --> 01:20:53,472
Scott: I was like, am I the only one on this train who understood what that guy just said?

1604
01:20:53,493 --> 01:20:54,810
Rym: The thing is, we never lived through it.

1605
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:59,150
Rym: We just know it thanks to Wikipedia because that's the only reason I know anything.

1606
01:21:00,611 --> 01:21:05,314
Rym: I learned a little bit from our and I repeat that fact often, but apparently no one learns that.

1607
01:21:05,335 --> 01:21:07,270
Scott: That's they keep thinking I'm smart.

1608
01:21:07,471 --> 01:21:07,856
Rym: I don't know.

1609
01:21:07,877 --> 01:21:08,770
Rym: Burning Con was great.

1610
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:15,273
Scott: If anyway, if best burning con yet, five excellent sessions past burning cons have had four or three.

1611
01:21:15,293 --> 01:21:21,141
Rym: If any of you did not go because you were afraid of running a game, you're a fool.

1612
01:21:21,161 --> 01:21:22,110
Scott: I pity you fool.

1613
01:21:22,531 --> 01:21:25,409
Rym: This was this is one of the better conventions I've ever been to.

1614
01:21:25,610 --> 01:21:32,476
Scott: I played five sessions of role playing through a hurricane over two days and all five of them were a plus.

1615
01:21:32,817 --> 01:21:36,250
Scott: You can't you can't get that kind of shit at like fucking Gen Con.

1616
01:21:36,652 --> 01:21:38,669
Scott: This was in New York City and it was so cheap.

1617
01:21:39,070 --> 01:21:45,170
Rym: I, as Lady Blackbird, cast off my disguise 10 seconds into the scenario and broadcast my love of the Pirate King to the world.

1618
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:48,169
Scott: I think I'm just going to run my scenario straight up again next year.

1619
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:48,634
Rym: Watch out.

1620
01:21:48,654 --> 01:21:49,328
Rym: You know what I'm going to do?

1621
01:21:49,852 --> 01:21:50,316
Rym: Plan it.

1622
01:21:50,982 --> 01:21:51,446
Scott: No, you can't.

1623
01:21:52,132 --> 01:21:54,050
Rym: Well, it'll be like me, Lou Crane, Tor.

1624
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:55,034
Rym: Not allowed.

1625
01:21:55,134 --> 01:21:57,490
Scott: I actually played in two games of Tor this week.

1626
01:21:57,650 --> 01:21:58,850
Rym: It's really fun to play in a game with Tor.

1627
01:21:58,870 --> 01:22:01,862
Scott: I've never had the shipwreck game and also the.

1628
01:22:01,883 --> 01:22:03,610
Scott: we played inheritance with him last year.

1629
01:22:03,830 --> 01:22:06,749
Rym: I played this like mouse guard Victorian thing that he was in.

1630
01:22:06,970 --> 01:22:07,051
Scott: Yeah.

1631
01:22:07,071 --> 01:22:08,690
Scott: And he also played the Dungeoneer's game.

1632
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:12,730
Scott: But the day he really busted out in that thief game hardcore.

1633
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:19,490
Scott: I was like, you know, this one point where he sort of unexpectedly busted out and I was like, his character got mad angry.

1634
01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:20,174
Scott: And I was.

1635
01:22:20,214 --> 01:22:22,528
Scott: I was like, whoa, watch that.

1636
01:22:27,841 --> 01:22:30,000
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1637
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:35,099
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1638

1644
