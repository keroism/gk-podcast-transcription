00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,917
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,852 --> 00:00:36,749
Rym: You realize other than one day on Wednesday after PAX I have not been back to my office since we went to PAX.

7
00:00:37,372 --> 00:00:40,023
Scott: You're gonna have to go to back to the office eventually if you want monies.

8
00:00:40,264 --> 00:00:40,405
Rym: Well.

9
00:00:40,425 --> 00:00:41,610
Rym: No I'm working from home.

10
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:45,288
Scott: It's the best thing ever except aren't you working the night shift from home?

11
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:53,338
Rym: well I am but last week I was working the day shift from home, and I got to say working the day shift from home is perhaps The greatest thing in the world.

12
00:00:53,378 --> 00:00:55,972
Rym: I mean you know I used to have a very sure no It's been all.

13
00:00:55,992 --> 00:00:56,173
Scott: you know.

14
00:00:56,193 --> 00:00:56,796
Scott: it's a lot greater.

15
00:00:56,816 --> 00:01:02,084
Scott: not working and just traveling wherever the hell you want Yeah, but I have to work right now at least though.

16
00:01:02,506 --> 00:01:06,643
Rym: I think I have enough money I could quit and live for a while before I eventually starve to death.

17
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:08,450
Scott: the thing is I've been thinking lately.

18
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,320
Scott: It's like hey, let's say I don't know.

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,869
Scott: I went to the doctor, and they told me I had like a year to live.

20
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:14,755
Scott: right What would I do?

21
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:16,950
Scott: I travel the world for you be like whatever?

22
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,695
Scott: But I could.

23
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:21,330
Scott: that means that if I could do that you could do that anyway.

24
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,336
Rym: I could do that anyway.

25
00:01:22,456 --> 00:01:24,145
Rym: at the end of that you'll have no assets.

26
00:01:24,206 --> 00:01:24,769
Rym: It'll be indigent.

27
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,414
Scott: What's indigent me?

28
00:01:26,575 --> 00:01:27,599
Rym: no no assets?

29
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:28,844
Rym: What do I do then?

30
00:01:28,864 --> 00:01:29,527
Rym: I don't know.

31
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:30,310
Rym: starve in the street.

32
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:33,365
Scott: There's no way to unindigent get some money.

33
00:01:33,405 --> 00:01:34,150
Scott: I have skills.

34
00:01:34,652 --> 00:01:40,568
Rym: I mean you'll probably have a bunch of debt chasing you because obviously if you you know if you were going to die You're gonna travel the world.

35
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:49,021
Scott: Credit cards pay for everything all right, so what if I travel the world and then I get back and the doctors like oh wait Actually, you're not gonna die.

36
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:49,970
Rym: that has happened.

37
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:51,055
Rym: And there was a case.

38
00:01:51,175 --> 00:01:55,655
Rym: it was on FARC a couple years ago where a guy was told that he had like a year to Live terminal illness.

39
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:59,590
Rym: so he like sold his house and spent all his money and like lived the life of his dream.

40
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:00,629
Scott: And then he was a homeless bum.

41
00:02:01,631 --> 00:02:04,184
Rym: He sued the doctor an idea.

42
00:02:04,365 --> 00:02:05,290
Scott: doctors got money.

43
00:02:05,553 --> 00:02:06,908
Rym: I don't I don't know what came of it.

44
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:09,169
Scott: Hopefully you just get the doctor to pay off the debt.

45
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,154
Scott: Then you can get a job.

46
00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:11,139
Rym: me here's the problem.

47
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:17,009
Rym: if he got all of it taken care of You realize the obvious scam is you work with a doctor?

48
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,549
Rym: To diagnose you and then you guys have a party.

49
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:26,870
Scott: Anyway, no you know why you wouldn't do that because what would have you know what it happens, then it's now insurance fraud.

50
00:02:27,393 --> 00:02:29,528
Rym: Yeah, insurance fraud is very lucrative.

51
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:33,209
Scott: I guess Unless you're uninsured.

52
00:02:34,032 --> 00:02:35,497
Scott: But then who are you gonna get money from?

53
00:02:35,637 --> 00:02:40,252
Rym: well if you're uninsured by definition you cannot be party to insurance fraud I know.

54
00:02:40,272 --> 00:02:50,129
Scott: but then you also cannot be party to a bunch of money to help you go around the world Unless you are the guy who sets the house on fire to precipitate the insurance fraud.

55
00:02:51,114 --> 00:02:52,584
Rym: Uh-huh, then you get paid and you're.

56
00:02:52,644 --> 00:02:53,450
Scott: then you're an arsonist.

57
00:02:55,154 --> 00:02:56,309
Rym: You'll be good at arson.

58
00:02:57,713 --> 00:03:03,550
Rym: Anyway, but having all this free time I've been working European banking hours this week, and I've been doing it from home.

59
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:09,114
Rym: He's a bank holiday I would have but there weren't any bank holidays while I was doing the European shift.

60
00:03:09,616 --> 00:03:09,857
Scott: is it?

61
00:03:09,897 --> 00:03:11,944
Scott: is it all of Europe or just UK or what?

62
00:03:12,245 --> 00:03:13,450
Rym: well it's complicated.

63
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,079
Rym: You know our our operation is based in bank holidays.

64
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:16,982
Scott: They're only in London's.

65
00:03:17,043 --> 00:03:18,889
Rym: I think well no, but the stock UK?

66
00:03:19,852 --> 00:03:22,399
Rym: The complicated answer is that there was a bank holiday.

67
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:22,881
Rym: that happened.

68
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:29,290
Rym: that was only UK so our people took the day off But the rest of the European markets were active, so it was this complicated.

69
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:34,488
Rym: We're still figuring out how to handle that mmm, but working from home a lot of free time.

70
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,030
Rym: What am I doing?

71
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,081
Rym: I'm watching the space train.

72
00:03:37,403 --> 00:03:41,079
Scott: Oh space train already finished I'm you know I ever think about it.

73
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,989
Scott: space trains like a hundred and what 17 episodes something like that.

74
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:48,510
Scott: There aren't too many people in the history of the universe who have seen the whole thing.

75
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,302
Scott: I've said this probably hundreds of people who've seen the whole thing and I'm one of them.

76
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:53,727
Scott: every single episode.

77
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:57,485
Rym: Holy shit You know watch every lazy Matsumoto everything.

78
00:03:57,525 --> 00:03:58,450
Scott: That's just impossible.

79
00:04:00,514 --> 00:04:01,827
Scott: Like zero people who've done that.

80
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,635
Scott: Samoto is among the zero people.

81
00:04:04,656 --> 00:04:10,595
Rym: man at some point has to die and as long as he dies before you you could Theoretically watch it all.

82
00:04:11,197 --> 00:04:13,405
Scott: yeah, I guess it takes less time to watch and it takes to make.

83
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:14,308
Scott: and they made it all.

84
00:04:14,448 --> 00:04:25,845
Rym: so Yeah, but one thing I got to say you know I watch like the whole beginning And I watched like all these rent like 20 or so episodes all through the middle And now I'm watching like the last 15 episodes.

85
00:04:26,448 --> 00:04:34,089
Rym: and one thing I got to say you know Matsumoto lays on the melodrama pretty thick but as we always say he's the only man in the world Who can do it with a straight face?

86
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:45,230
Rym: But he's really laying it on thick like that episode where there are two Galaxy Express three nines I was a good Mattel's and two well one Tetsuro and one other guy.

87
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,925
Scott: And then they don't even let you know if the mix-up was actually a mix-up or not.

88
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:53,362
Scott: They're just like yeah It's alright bitches ah and they throw in in that episode.

89
00:04:53,382 --> 00:04:57,730
Rym: They throw that whole side story of yeah There's also a world with the cyborgs of the good guys.

90
00:04:59,577 --> 00:05:00,308
Scott: Yep, that's a good one.

91
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:07,873
Rym: But there's like this five-minute scene of people saying goodbye to each other and that was like the most melodrama in the whole series As far as I can tell.

92
00:05:08,636 --> 00:05:10,142
Scott: I know captain Harlock.

93
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:10,925
Scott: He can lay it out.

94
00:05:10,945 --> 00:05:11,487
Scott: I'm pretty heavy.

95
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:13,999
Scott: well that series I mean it was an episode with captain heart.

96
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:16,150
Scott: it was but that's actually a three-parter.

97
00:05:16,311 --> 00:05:19,450
Rym: But that three-parter couldn't be nearly as melodramatic as Arcadia.

98
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,575
Scott: Did you not watch the three-parter?

99
00:05:20,595 --> 00:05:21,278
Rym: I did not.

100
00:05:21,299 --> 00:05:22,826
Scott: I'll have to tell you which episodes those are.

101
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:23,790
Rym: I'll go back and watch that shit.

102
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,850
Rym: I love me some Harlock all right, but we'll probably review Galaxy Express.

103
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,662
Rym: We just have to watch the movie again, and I have to finish watching the end of the show.

104
00:05:30,682 --> 00:05:32,048
Scott: Yeah it needs to be a big movie showing going on.

105
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,719
Rym: Yeah, maybe Sunday after the game.

106
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:36,285
Rym: We're playing you know burning wheel this weekend.

107
00:05:36,346 --> 00:05:37,430
Scott: I don't know about Sunday.

108
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,945
Rym: Yeah, the problem is we started like 10.

109
00:05:39,945 --> 00:05:43,357
Rym: Yeah, right We'll see anyway.

110
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,743
Rym: What do you got for me?

111
00:05:45,085 --> 00:05:46,290
Scott: What do I have for you?

112
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,739
Scott: Well, you know there isn't really news.

113
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:50,385
Scott: well actually there is one big news.

114
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:51,690
Rym: There's the obligatory.

115
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:57,470
Scott: There's no more anime industry blah blah blah blah, but yeah, and you know comic news is usually pretty uninteresting.

116
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,150
Scott: It's usually like a new series from so-and-so or you know up so-and-so canceled.

117
00:06:02,371 --> 00:06:05,650
Scott: It's not like this big happenings too often in the world of comics.

118
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:13,423
Scott: So I'm gonna continue my trend of doing geek bites in the Wednesday news slot And I'll continue this trend with this book here.

119
00:06:14,227 --> 00:06:18,138
Scott: It's Marvel 1985. it's let's see it's $20.

120
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:22,235
Scott: I didn't pay $20 And I don't.

121
00:06:22,296 --> 00:06:29,405
Scott: it's not really thick enough to be $20 worth, but anyway This is uh you remember the Marvel 1602 by Neil Gaiman.

122
00:06:29,706 --> 00:06:30,830
Rym: Oh, yeah, that was actually pretty good.

123
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,735
Scott: That was actually very good.

124
00:06:31,755 --> 00:06:32,158
Rym: I liked it.

125
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:35,734
Scott: This is not as good But it's okay.

126
00:06:36,055 --> 00:06:37,398
Scott: basically the deal is right.

127
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,004
Scott: is is 1985 in the United States.

128
00:06:40,345 --> 00:06:42,270
Scott: I forget exactly where maybe, California.

129
00:06:42,331 --> 00:06:55,109
Scott: I forget it's basically a suburban Somewhat rural type of place and as a kid with divorced parents and he goes to live with his dad or whatever and There's a weird house in the woods that you know something's going on there.

130
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:58,583
Scott: I'm basically you know the kid thinks he's insane.

131
00:06:58,663 --> 00:06:59,607
Scott: cuz like he sees dr.

132
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:04,939
Scott: Doom at the house and You know sure enough right the kid.

133
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,343
Scott: You know at first.

134
00:07:06,363 --> 00:07:07,607
Rym: It's not insane and dr.

135
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:15,657
Scott: Doom is at the house yeah, and so pretty much all the Marvel bad guys are at this house and They're totally real just hanging out playing poker.

136
00:07:15,957 --> 00:07:20,268
Scott: no eventually they just start devastating everything on purpose in a smart way.

137
00:07:20,288 --> 00:07:21,456
Rym: man Look at dr.

138
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:21,698
Rym: Doom.

139
00:07:21,718 --> 00:07:22,890
Rym: He's devastating everyone.

140
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:27,108
Scott: They just kept like they were going out in a radius from this house just fucking everything up.

141
00:07:27,671 --> 00:07:28,133
Scott: And why?

142
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:32,276
Scott: why are they working together for take they want to take over the world like hey There's no heroes in this world.

143
00:07:32,296 --> 00:07:38,358
Rym: Let's just take it over, but I don't know Devin Devastating everything is not the same as taking everything over.

144
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:41,227
Scott: I know it's a reign of terror kind of situation.

145
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:44,856
Scott: You know sort of like The all hail Megatron exactly.

146
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:47,947
Scott: that's not to say you know but again that all hail.

147
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,641
Rym: Megatron fell short Primarily because it did such like the superficial.

148
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:54,482
Rym: He's in charge now didn't go into all the cool stuff They could have done.

149
00:07:54,686 --> 00:08:02,316
Scott: yeah We need to really make one or bad guys are really actually smart like full-on smart and this one Sort of gets there a little bit.

150
00:08:02,677 --> 00:08:06,550
Scott: really what this is all about is sort of like the flavor like the art is not what?

151
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:17,132
Scott: You would normally expect from you know Marvel superhero comic, and it's got all sorts of 80s nostalgia going on And it's pretty cool, and I liked it anyway It was.

152
00:08:17,353 --> 00:08:18,258
Scott: you know it's not like.

153
00:08:18,338 --> 00:08:23,280
Scott: oh man everyone rush out and buy Marvel 1985 Holy shit, but it's sort of like hey.

154
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,344
Scott: This is pretty fun.

155
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:27,395
Scott: You know little kid Galactus shows up.

156
00:08:27,556 --> 00:08:30,125
Scott: It's crazy time you probably want to read.

157
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:30,567
Rym: you know what.

158
00:08:30,948 --> 00:08:31,510
Rym: I take that back.

159
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,530
Rym: You want to read this before you read 1602 because it's a roller coaster syndrome.

160
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:39,970
Scott: Yeah, it's not really related to 1602 except for the fact that there's a year in the title.

161
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:46,820
Rym: Oh, I know the title is mostly for the same problem that the first Batman comic I ever actually read was Dark Knight Returns.

162
00:08:46,921 --> 00:08:49,434
Rym: No every other Batman comic Just doesn't live up.

163
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:52,450
Scott: I should get some of the other ones that people say are also great.

164
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:53,695
Rym: Yeah, but everyone agrees.

165
00:08:53,715 --> 00:08:54,860
Rym: They're not as good.

166
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,150
Rym: They're good, but they're not as good anyway.

167
00:08:57,472 --> 00:09:01,370
Scott: So yeah, if you haven't read 1602 you should definitely go and get that instead.

168
00:09:02,053 --> 00:09:03,943
Scott: You want to do a whole show on it.

169
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:04,506
Rym: I think we could do.

170
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:05,390
Scott: I gotta read it again.

171
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:07,920
Rym: All right pretty much anything.

172
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,447
Scott: I got the hardcover that bitch.

173
00:09:09,647 --> 00:09:15,350
Rym: You know I Superheroes aside Thor has about plus 10 to my liking of anything.

174
00:09:16,191 --> 00:09:16,592
Scott: Why don't you?

175
00:09:16,633 --> 00:09:18,800
Scott: why didn't you could read Thor every month if you wanted to?

176
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,261
Scott: why don't you?

177
00:09:19,623 --> 00:09:21,810
Rym: because that you realize Thor the comic?

178
00:09:22,112 --> 00:09:26,812
Rym: Has a total score of 10.

179
00:09:26,812 --> 00:09:33,119
Rym: So anyway was actually some big news in the anime con comic-con circuit And they all come together every year.

180
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,470
Rym: we go to the New York comic-con and the New York anime festival.

181
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,756
Scott: Okay festivals in two weeks.

182
00:09:37,037 --> 00:09:38,906
Rym: Yes, and we'll talk about that during the meta bit.

183
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:53,130
Rym: I'm gonna push it off But the New York comic-con and the New York anime festival starting in 2010 at least once and Probably forever after this as long as this doesn't like explode are going to be confined into one convention.

184
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,676
Rym: They're gonna take over the whole Javits.

185
00:09:54,997 --> 00:09:57,186
Rym: It's gonna be like the biggest craziest thing ever.

186
00:09:57,266 --> 00:10:01,481
Rym: I think in the long run It's going to eclipse some of those West Coast shows.

187
00:10:02,003 --> 00:10:04,130
Scott: wow that's it's pretty crazy.

188
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:08,042
Rym: Anime festival gets a ton of people like it's one of the bigger anime cons.

189
00:10:08,403 --> 00:10:19,562
Rym: the New York comic-con is like the biggest thing outside Of STCC yeah, and now that they're putting both in the same building in New York City I think they realize it's cheaper to do one big convention than two right.

190
00:10:19,924 --> 00:10:25,518
Scott: and also you know New York anime festival It's pretty great But it's not really you know super great.

191
00:10:25,678 --> 00:10:30,012
Scott: and the New York comic-con like needs a little bit more to get near to San Diego's Level.

192
00:10:30,032 --> 00:10:31,057
Scott: it's like you know.

193
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:33,390
Scott: combining them was a really really great strategy.

194
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:36,130
Scott: However, I hope they realize you know they're gonna.

195
00:10:36,412 --> 00:10:39,370
Scott: You know obviously they'll be able to sell more tickets because they have the whole job at once.

196
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:40,838
Rym: I think what I know.

197
00:10:40,918 --> 00:10:41,683
Rym: they know this.

198
00:10:42,145 --> 00:10:42,990
Rym: I know they know it.

199
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:44,488
Rym: I don't know what they're going to do about it.

200
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:49,810
Rym: But the I mean while notice how a lot of anime people go to the New York comic-con just because they like convention.

201
00:10:49,991 --> 00:10:50,634
Rym: So it's not like.

202
00:10:50,674 --> 00:10:51,258
Rym: they're not from.

203
00:10:51,298 --> 00:10:57,210
Rym: the people who go to the New York comic-con are not familiar with The anime kids and what they do at cons like they're used to that.

204
00:10:57,271 --> 00:10:57,643
Rym: It's there.

205
00:10:58,331 --> 00:11:02,661
Rym: But the New York comic-con like here's example the dealers room is.

206
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:09,879
Rym: the dealer area is basically just like here's the row of Silver Age comics, and here's the row of Gold Age comics.

207
00:11:10,842 --> 00:11:15,518
Rym: and the dealers room at an anime con is here's the row of swords Here's the row of manga.

208
00:11:15,538 --> 00:11:18,130
Rym: I don't know how they're going to coexist.

209
00:11:18,973 --> 00:11:20,310
Scott: It's gonna be really really interesting.

210
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:26,199
Scott: I think the thing is actually I kind of really like this because you know We're definitely gonna be doing stuff at it.

211
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:27,425
Scott: No matter what my god.

212
00:11:27,465 --> 00:11:27,606
Rym: Yes.

213
00:11:27,626 --> 00:11:29,032
Rym: We're already taught We're.

214
00:11:29,193 --> 00:11:31,643
Rym: the thing is I'm a bigger audience is better right.

215
00:11:31,683 --> 00:11:35,439
Scott: and second of all you know the New York And a festival was really a one-day con.

216
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:40,923
Scott: you would go walk around for a day looking at stuff And that'd be it and then your comic-con was a one-day con.

217
00:11:40,943 --> 00:11:43,092
Scott: you walked around looking at the exhibition hall And that was it.

218
00:11:43,152 --> 00:11:44,216
Scott: and they're really the panels.

219
00:11:44,658 --> 00:11:47,609
Scott: not that exciting except our panels right.

220
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:54,287
Scott: if they These two this is gonna be a three-day full-on do everything you can at this con.

221
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:55,330
Scott: get the full action.

222
00:11:55,511 --> 00:12:05,650
Rym: So I know many of you have seen us at the New York comic-con or anime festival for and we're usually like well usually like Breeze in do like our panels and disappear, and then we'll like interview some people and we're gone like we're ghosts.

223
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:07,944
Scott: I might just for the one year.

224
00:12:07,965 --> 00:12:08,470
Scott: We had a table.

225
00:12:08,671 --> 00:12:12,190
Rym: Yeah, I might just get a hotel room and just stay in the city for the whole weekend.

226
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:12,613
Scott: I'm.

227
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:16,932
Scott: hopefully we'll be living in the city by October of 2010.

228
00:12:16,932 --> 00:12:20,070
Scott: If I actually gonna call a guy tomorrow, I saw some nice apart.

229
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:20,592
Scott: We'll see.

230
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:20,853
Rym: cuz.

231
00:12:21,114 --> 00:12:22,459
Rym: maybe we'll fast forward to that time.

232
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:25,069
Rym: you'll be living in like one of the five bedrooms in my house.

233
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:26,616
Scott: I don't know about that.

234
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,622
Rym: I don't know.

235
00:12:27,662 --> 00:12:28,567
Rym: my house is pretty nice.

236
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:32,909
Scott: if I get it No, and if I'm living in your house, then you can go live in somewhere else.

237
00:12:34,192 --> 00:12:35,518
Rym: But anyway that the other.

238
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:37,890
Rym: the one issue I see too is with the artist alley.

239
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,496
Rym: I mean near anime festival.

240
00:12:39,536 --> 00:12:44,133
Rym: artist alley is a artist alley like anime cons have New York.

241
00:12:44,174 --> 00:12:44,697
Rym: comic-con.

242
00:12:44,737 --> 00:12:46,710
Rym: artist alley is mostly big-name people.

243
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:47,552
Scott: Yeah It's like.

244
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:50,090
Scott: how are they going to really shouldn't be in an artist alley?

245
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:50,571
Scott: How?

246
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:53,185
Rym: because I think the artist alley is a different thing at a comic-con.

247
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,030
Scott: I think what they're gonna do.

248
00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:55,015
Scott: This is my prediction.

249
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:55,377
Scott: You're ready.

250
00:12:55,558 --> 00:12:56,684
Rym: All right, cuz I have a prediction too.

251
00:12:56,704 --> 00:12:59,750
Scott: Let's see if they're the same you go Okay, so the New York comic-con last year, right?

252
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:05,331
Scott: It took up right the big area the main area of the Javits the entire main area Right.

253
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:13,019
Scott: the New York anime festival took up the whole downstairs area of the Javits, you know, it wasn't in the upstairs It was in the downstairs.

254
00:13:13,846 --> 00:13:18,270
Scott: I think That what they're gonna do is they're not gonna merge them like physically.

255
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:24,210
Scott: It's gonna be the New York comic-con upstairs new kind of festival downstairs at the same time and one ticket will get you into both.

256
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:28,540
Scott: So that I think you know A lot of comic people won't even go downstairs.

257
00:13:28,902 --> 00:13:30,790
Scott: a lot of enemy people won't even go upstairs.

258
00:13:31,112 --> 00:13:32,139
Rym: But I don't will.

259
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:33,105
Rym: I disagree on that point.

260
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:38,786
Rym: if they do it that way I think the comic people are going to stay in the comic area, but the anime people will be everywhere.

261
00:13:39,448 --> 00:13:40,010
Scott: It's possible.

262
00:13:40,972 --> 00:13:43,050
Scott: They'll definitely be cross mixing of kinds.

263
00:13:43,331 --> 00:13:44,136
Rym: I just think there'll be a lot.

264
00:13:44,196 --> 00:13:46,690
Scott: I think there will be less cross mixing than you would think.

265
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:49,716
Rym: No I think there's gonna be a very disparate cross mixing.

266
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:52,809
Rym: a lot more anime people are gonna check out comic stuff than vice-versa.

267
00:13:53,171 --> 00:13:55,350
Rym: It's possible because you know just everything is the question.

268
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:55,793
Scott: I remember

269
00:13:55,833 --> 00:14:08,950
Rym: every anime con we go to like people are into a lot of things but Every comic-con we go to like half the people who run into are literally like with no exaggeration Telling us things like I'm here to buy Silver Age spider-man and that is the only reason I'm here.

270
00:14:09,091 --> 00:14:10,216
Scott: I know how about this right?

271
00:14:10,618 --> 00:14:13,170
Scott: Let's say you're a dealer and there's two dealer rooms.

272
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:19,013
Scott: Obviously if you're like an anime dealer, you know which one to go in and if you're like a guy who's selling Silver Age comics You know where to go.

273
00:14:19,073 --> 00:14:20,822
Rym: What if you're the sword dealer, right?

274
00:14:20,842 --> 00:14:22,630
Scott: Well, what if you're like vertical comics, right?

275
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,300
Scott: They would get a booth at both conventions.

276
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,910
Scott: They would get you know, vertical incorporated.

277
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:28,363
Scott: They would get a booth at the anime and they get a booth.

278
00:14:28,423 --> 00:14:29,650
Rym: I don't think they're gonna do it that way.

279
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,056
Rym: I think it's gonna be more integrated.

280
00:14:31,096 --> 00:14:34,670
Rym: I think more integrated, but I think like I think the artist alley will be tiered.

281
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:39,867
Rym: They'll be like multiple Sections of the artist alley that are basically the same but a lot of different titles.

282
00:14:40,027 --> 00:14:40,409
Scott: They got it.

283
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,293
Scott: It'll be definitely.

284
00:14:41,474 --> 00:14:50,050
Scott: it's gonna be really really really really interesting But it's a long way off so they have a lot of time to get it right or at least to figure things out.

285
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:50,873
Rym: But that's my prediction.

286
00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:55,170
Rym: They're gonna have like the artist alley will have like the big name section and the normal section.

287
00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:02,290
Scott: I think it would actually be better if they mix them up like the big names and the small names to fix the traffic problems In the New York comic-con artist alley.

288
00:15:02,971 --> 00:15:05,099
Scott: You know because the comic-con artist alley is big problems.

289
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,657
Scott: all those big names if they put all the anime people mixed in Shuffle it up.

290
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,170
Scott: You can really help the traffic out.

291
00:15:10,391 --> 00:15:14,868
Rym: No, then you get the life old situation where the penny arcade line just goes past them and no one ever sees the table.

292
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:21,530
Scott: Yeah But it helps the traffic gives the lines to hand maybe maybe and then you know what all those people standing in line.

293
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:22,357
Scott: We'll look at their shit.

294
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,810
Rym: They're not gonna do it that way though.

295
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:24,512
Rym: Yeah I'm pretty sure.

296
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:28,828
Rym: they're just gonna have areas with different titles like different designations and the same thing.

297
00:15:28,848 --> 00:15:36,868
Rym: in the dealers room They're probably gonna have like the comic area of people just selling comics and like different areas of different kinds of dealers But I'm gonna have like the same.

298
00:15:37,211 --> 00:15:39,163
Scott: Like how many panel rooms are they gonna be like?

299
00:15:39,203 --> 00:15:40,250
Scott: are you gonna have like a problem?

300
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:44,450
Scott: We're like there's an anime panel you want to go to but there's a comic-con panel at the same time.

301
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,801
Scott: It's just like ah, what do I see?

302
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:46,810
Rym: most definitely?

303
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,339
Rym: There's gonna be a lot of panels you have to deal with.

304
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,009
Scott: it's gonna be crazy crazy shit.

305
00:15:50,231 --> 00:15:51,154
Rym: I'm excited me.

306
00:15:51,174 --> 00:15:51,857
Scott: a three-day deal.

307
00:15:51,897 --> 00:15:54,869
Rym: The main reason I'm excited is that normally, you know, we'd only do panels.

308
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:59,050
Rym: the New York Anime Festival we were just now because the comic-con is branching more and more into gaming.

309
00:15:59,614 --> 00:16:01,950
Rym: We really want to bring our gaming content to the New York comic.

310
00:16:02,131 --> 00:16:05,450
Scott: Yeah, there was a lot of gaming like companies at the New York comic-con last year.

311
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,269
Scott: Remember we talked to like upper deck with their Warcraft minis and stuff.

312
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,125
Scott: Yeah, it was that whole table that had all those board games.

313
00:16:11,165 --> 00:16:13,315
Rym: if they unify them It's the best of both worlds.

314
00:16:13,335 --> 00:16:18,664
Rym: because remember when we brought up beyond D&D to Otakon and it was like this You know like thousand people in the room standing room.

315
00:16:18,704 --> 00:16:19,469
Rym: only crazy thing.

316
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:27,164
Rym: Now we have the excuse to do panels like that at a comic-con anime festival Daryl Surratt Non-withstanding.

317
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:31,544
Scott: no Anyway, yeah, it's gonna be a very interesting con.

318
00:16:31,585 --> 00:16:37,910
Scott: It's a long way off and I'm actually you know, it's like I wasn't really looking forward to New York anime festival comic-con.

319
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,173
Scott: It was just sort of like alright here they come again, you know What am I gonna do?

320
00:16:41,355 --> 00:16:43,450
Rym: I'm gonna talk to like David Peterson again.

321
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,012
Scott: I know it's like.

322
00:16:44,052 --> 00:16:46,320
Scott: it's much better for me because now I've got another.

323
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:55,190
Scott: I like to have fewer cons that are More powerful and have lots of air cons that take up a lot of time and a lot of energy, but aren't that great?

324
00:17:02,011 --> 00:17:06,130
Rym: But anyway things of the day, so I have a non video here.

325
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:12,053
Rym: Usually it's like videos from College Humor, but I'm trying to avoid that because seriously you were looking at a few considering I was.

326
00:17:12,174 --> 00:17:14,609
Rym: but seriously half my things of the day are from College Humor.

327
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,162
Rym: You should just go to College Humor and watch their video.

328
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,818
Scott: college humor comm slash videos Yes, but any rims.

329
00:17:19,858 --> 00:17:20,563
Scott: things of the day.

330
00:17:20,644 --> 00:17:26,262
Rym: So this guy This guy has been a fan of Mad Max for 27 years.

331
00:17:26,363 --> 00:17:28,249
Rym: Mad Max is like the greatest movie in the world.

332
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:30,375
Rym: to him There's a fan of everything.

333
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:34,650
Rym: so what he has done is first he recreated the car the Mad Max interceptor.

334
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,389
Scott: That's pretty awesome.

335
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:38,130
Rym: And he has a blue healer named dog All right.

336
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:44,769
Rym: And he moved to the Australian outback to make a Mad Max museum and live as much as possible the life of Mad Max.

337
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:47,095
Scott: Two men enter one man leave he.

338
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:48,701

00:17:48,941 --> 00:17:50,065
Scott: when he doesn't leave what happens?

340
00:17:50,106 --> 00:17:50,346
Scott: then?

00:17:50,447 --> 00:17:51,350
Rym: there's this town.

342
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:55,810
Rym: I think it's called Silverton in Australia, and I think they actually filmed Mad Max out in that area.

343
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,034
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of the.

344

00:18:06,341 --> 00:18:12,070
Rym: is just the story behind This is cool enough and Mad Max is cool enough to where I think it warrants the thing of the day.

349
00:18:14,142 --> 00:18:15,510

00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:34,114
Scott: You know we're just talking about Pokemon, but there's a lot of Pokemaniacs out there.

Rym: here is an example.

Rym: He's a Mad Max nerd.

Scott: right about you?

376
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:33,210
Scott: in the newspaper Times online I read about you in the times, and I you know I heard you're a fan of Mad Max.

377
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:38,790
Scott: Here is a you know a Japanese animated cartoon from the olden days that I think you might enjoy it.

378
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:39,756
Scott: It's very similar to mad.

379
00:19:39,776 --> 00:19:41,405
Rym: Wow Silverton all right.

380
00:19:41,445 --> 00:19:42,230
Rym: It's out in the Outback.

381
00:19:42,912 --> 00:19:45,880
Rym: It is 800 miles west of Sydney.

382
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:47,465
Scott: That's in the middle of nowhere.

383
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:50,813
Rym: It has a population of 51 Including him.

384
00:19:50,854 --> 00:19:52,601
Rym: so he was the 51st person to move.

385
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:55,798
Scott: so if you address it to you know I'm sure it'll get there.

386
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,230
Scott: you watch a painting posted.

387
00:19:57,331 --> 00:19:59,160
Rym: They're like three other people named that.

388
00:19:59,482 --> 00:20:00,970
Scott: I wonder how often they get mail out there.

389
00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:02,602
Scott: I don't know they got to have met.

390
00:20:02,622 --> 00:20:03,770
Scott: this is not stare must be man.

391
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,191
Scott: Here's the thing.

392
00:20:04,573 --> 00:20:08,145
Rym: I want to send something to this town now because think there's only 51 people in the town.

393
00:20:08,848 --> 00:20:13,650
Rym: if a DVD Shows up in the mail you will probably have everyone in that town watching it.

394
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,601
Scott: I'm sure that they can buy things on Amazon.

395
00:20:15,621 --> 00:20:16,929
Scott: They probably get DVDs all the time.

396
00:20:17,832 --> 00:20:26,030
Rym: I will probably make more fans of fist of the North Star by mailing a DVD to this remote Mad Max town than I ever Would talking about it on GeekNights possible.

397
00:20:27,272 --> 00:20:28,830
Scott: Anyway, so I got thing of the day.

398
00:20:28,931 --> 00:20:34,988
Scott: It's more appropriate for a Tuesday But I wanted to spread this love to the Wednesday because I think the Tuesday would already know about this kind of thing.

399
00:20:35,008 --> 00:20:38,372
Scott: all right You know we like Cthulhu.

400
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:39,977
Scott: who doesn't like Cthulhu right?

401
00:20:40,278 --> 00:20:43,087
Scott: ah no though tap I think he actually likes it.

402
00:20:43,107 --> 00:20:43,950
Rym: It's hard to say.

403
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,270
Scott: I mean he's always praying to anyway.

404
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,138
Scott: Yeah, but um and you know we like battle tech.

405
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:50,264
Scott: right two great gaming classics.

406
00:20:50,324 --> 00:20:52,270
Scott: You know the battle tech and the call of Cthulhu, right?

407
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,969
Scott: How about Cthulhu tech?

408
00:20:56,873 --> 00:20:58,078
Rym: Is this like poke through Lou?

409
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,243
Scott: no, it's totally.

410
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,930
Scott: this is actually a legit game.

411
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,277
Scott: It actually has to expand.

412
00:21:02,318 --> 00:21:04,550
Rym: is poke through Lou was the legit game?

413
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:07,830
Scott: No, this is a super legit game like holy crap.

414
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:13,590
Scott: So selling a rule book in PDF for like 70 bucks is this literally just max versus Cthulhu?

415
00:21:14,652 --> 00:21:15,097
Scott: I'm it's.

416
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:21,225
Scott: it's fucking Cthulhu tag and it's for real and it actually won a lot of awards for being a good game.

417
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:22,349
Rym: Let's get it.

418
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:23,599
Scott: It's like 70 bucks.

419
00:21:23,639 --> 00:21:27,161
Scott: by thinking gonna pay for it anyway I might pay and I get a PDF immediately.

420
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:29,050
Scott: so and then the full book will come later.

421
00:21:29,412 --> 00:21:32,789
Scott: And then if we play it if we actually play it then I'll buy some of the expansion bits.

422
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:36,868
Scott: The one expansion allows for like minor cults to enter the game.

423
00:21:36,888 --> 00:21:39,638
Scott: ah And I didn't read what the other one did.

424
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:42,490
Scott: but yeah Cthulhu tech is totally for reals.

425
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:44,170
Rym: I've sounded up our alley in a big way.

426
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:44,653
Scott: I know.

427
00:21:44,794 --> 00:21:46,403
Scott: even if it's a bad you know I can't.

428
00:21:46,524 --> 00:21:47,570
Scott: it's won a lot of awards.

429
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,257
Scott: I mean come on even if it's shitty.

430
00:21:49,398 --> 00:21:52,110
Rym: it'll go on the shelf next to all the other really expensive though.

431
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:56,625
Rym: It'll go next to all the other RPGs and board games that aren't good, but we bought anyway.

432
00:21:57,046 --> 00:21:58,250
Rym: Yeah like Twilight Struggle.

433
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,094
Scott: Yeah, I spent.

434
00:21:59,294 --> 00:22:01,906
Scott: I spent more money five dollars more on battle lore.

435
00:22:01,986 --> 00:22:04,819
Rym: so yeah I see I told you battle or is a bad.

436

00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:12,994
Scott: hardly ever played a battle or and I actually have an extra board so you can play with a board That's twice as big.

439
00:22:13,014 --> 00:22:14,179
Scott: yeah, and I'll try.

440
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:23,317
Scott: you know I paid like a total of like 85 something $90 for both parts, so if you you know I'll sell it for a lot less than that.

441
00:22:23,317 --> 00:22:26,950
Scott: 50 bucks 40 bucks whatever battle or comes like a million miniatures.

442
00:22:27,236 --> 00:22:27,929

443
00:22:28,731 --> 00:22:34,688
Rym: So anyway before we get on to the main bit and our Pokemon adventure stylings This is where we do the meta bits.

00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:34,822
Rym: finally.

461
00:23:34,903 --> 00:23:35,970
Rym: I just I had to go dig it up.

462
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:41,929
Rym: I you know this was settled like four months ago So I had to go find like this old email to figure out what we're doing now.

463
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:53,278
Rym: So perhaps the last New York anime festival the New York anime festival is next weekend for the 25th 26th and 27th of September in the Jacob Javits Center in New York City.

464
00:23:53,719 --> 00:24:02,210
Rym: We are going to be there Friday and Saturday Friday evening 730 in Panel room 3. we were doing know your creators the same panel.

465
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,176
Rym: We did a note account.

466
00:24:03,196 --> 00:24:06,757
Rym: so if you saw the note account the last time we're gonna do that panel We're gonna revamp it.

467
00:24:06,777 --> 00:24:08,850
Rym: We're basically we're gonna drop it and do a similar panel.

468
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,290
Rym: That's very different, but accomplishes the same purpose.

469
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:13,556
Rym: So this is the last running of it.

470
00:24:13,596 --> 00:24:17,347
Rym: if you really want to say it check it out and on Saturday at 7 45 p.m.

471
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:23,390
Rym: also in panel 3 and Anime every fan should see colon cover your bases.

472
00:24:24,033 --> 00:24:26,503
Rym: That's basically an amalgamation of every different title.

473
00:24:26,544 --> 00:24:30,217
Rym: We've given this panel in the last Two panels only two panels.

474
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:32,886
Rym: It's pretty easy Friday and Saturday and Saturday.

475
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:34,090
Scott: They're both nighttime panels.

476
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:37,144
Scott: So during Saturday during the day, maybe we can go look at apartments or something.

477
00:24:37,204 --> 00:24:38,410
Rym: I think it's Saturday during the day.

478
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,143
Rym: I'm gonna do some stuff in the city for sure.

479
00:24:40,163 --> 00:24:41,090
Scott: we should go look at apartments.

480
00:24:41,411 --> 00:24:42,917
Rym: Yeah, or maybe we'll do a listener meetup.

481
00:24:43,137 --> 00:24:43,920
Scott: anyone who's going?

482
00:24:44,081 --> 00:24:44,924
Scott: oh, not a bad idea.

483
00:24:45,285 --> 00:24:50,670
Rym: Let us know and Saturday we'll try to schedule something like we can say hi, or maybe we'll take you guys out.

484
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:55,654
Scott: So I'll make a thread in the forum for like yeah 09 listener meetup.

485
00:24:55,734 --> 00:25:02,053
Scott: and if anyone listening to this is going to the nyaf then post there, and so if there's no more nyaf It's just the nyaf Nick.

486
00:25:02,394 --> 00:25:02,875
Scott: I think well.

487
00:25:03,036 --> 00:25:03,417
Scott: I mean there.

488
00:25:03,437 --> 00:25:04,681
Scott: start the read exhibitions.

489
00:25:04,762 --> 00:25:06,628
Scott: right they got this show in Chicago the c2e2.

490
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,959
Scott: Yeah, it's basically gonna be an everything con.

491
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,485
Scott: get you know everything nerdy right.

492
00:25:11,866 --> 00:25:15,370
Scott: so I think what they're doing is They realize that New York Comic Con combine it with nyaf.

493
00:25:15,711 --> 00:25:22,389
Scott: They can sort of make it more like the c2e2 and basically what they'll end up doing is saving a lot of resources and run Basically the same show twice.

494
00:25:22,751 --> 00:25:28,169
Rym: I'm honestly getting more and more excited about read doing these geek conventions because they're you see every year like they.

495
00:25:28,429 --> 00:25:31,630
Rym: you know They're a professional business, and you know I work with a lot of the people.

496
00:25:32,054 --> 00:25:32,721
Scott: You know it's.

497
00:25:32,943 --> 00:25:33,610
Scott: it's taken a while.

498
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:37,730
Scott: They started out doing the shows the same way they did their normal business II shows.

499
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:41,250
Scott: But now I think they've realized geek shows make a lot more money.

500
00:25:41,672 --> 00:25:45,850
Scott: They get a lot more press they're a lot more exciting and they're learning how to do them with time.

501
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:51,112
Rym: Yeah, you need more than just a room full of booze and as far as I can tell the staff like they're getting into it More and more.

502
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,217
Rym: they're really enjoying well.

503
00:25:52,237 --> 00:25:55,110
Scott: They're hiring a lot of people who are nerdy to handle that kind of shit.

504
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,958
Rym: Yep, but the other cool thing is that remember they're doing.

505
00:25:57,978 --> 00:26:01,328
Rym: they're handling all the logistics for PAX East - so read one.

506
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:24,444
Rym: They spend all this time like analyzing their conventions and figuring out how to do them better And they have professional resources to throw at that sort of thing - by managing PAX East and All these different comic and anime cons they basically are in a position to learn from like the things that all these different kinds of cons do well and Amalgamate them into what could be in the end like the generic uber geek con.

507
00:26:24,544 --> 00:26:25,547
Scott: Yeah, it's definitely.

508
00:26:25,688 --> 00:26:25,888
Scott: you know.

509
00:26:25,908 --> 00:26:29,490
Scott: their cons You know are good, but they're not like oh super amazing.

510
00:26:29,831 --> 00:26:38,484
Scott: But they're definitely you can see they're clearly improving and learning and I think they're gonna you know Eventually, they're just gonna be like the masters of the geek con plus.

511
00:26:38,524 --> 00:26:40,678
Rym: I will say as a meta aside You're like we do.

512
00:26:40,698 --> 00:26:45,207
Rym: we're staff on Connecticut We're the heads of panels and we do stuff like Otakon and everything and anime.

513
00:26:45,227 --> 00:26:48,230
Rym: Boston's fun But it's not really relevant to a lot of you.

514
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:51,750
Rym: You know you go to these cons as an attendee you want to enjoy the panels do all the stuff.

515
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:58,789
Rym: but from our perspective the meta perspective as like performers as Lecturers as staff is all this stuff.

516
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:05,630
Rym: The professional cons and the ones run by read are just so much nicer to work with and so much easier to deal with.

517
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,980
Scott: They actually email you back.

518
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:08,230
Scott: That's pretty much the only difference.

519
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:08,491
Scott: I mean.

520
00:27:08,973 --> 00:27:14,615
Rym: if you guys saw like all the bullshit and hurdles we have to go through at some of these fan conventions to do That like just to do a panel.

521
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:15,278
Scott: It's mostly cuz.

522
00:27:15,318 --> 00:27:16,724
Scott: just people don't email us back.

523
00:27:16,744 --> 00:27:18,695
Scott: That's really the only problem It's.

524
00:27:18,775 --> 00:27:20,750
Rym: but I mean more and more.

525
00:27:21,232 --> 00:27:27,098
Rym: I don't want to turn my back on the fan run cons because I like them and for attendees I still think in a lot of ways they're better.

526
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,629
Rym: like Otakon and anime Boston have a lot going for them.

527
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:32,800
Rym: Yeah, then of course Pax West is like the ultimate of that.

528
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:39,430
Rym: Yep, but while I don't want to turn my back on these fan cons Personally, it's just so much easier to go to the professional con.

529
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:47,153
Scott: Yeah, I think our con schedule for the foreseeable future is anime Boston Otakon Pax East-West Connecticut.

530
00:27:47,193 --> 00:27:50,269
Scott: yeah, New York Comic Con Connecticut, and I think that's it right.

531
00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:54,105
Rym: yep And you know the little ancillary things like Zenkai con because that you know our friends Rob.

532
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:55,190
Scott: are we doing that yeah?

533
00:27:55,572 --> 00:28:00,110
Rym: Yeah, we're doing some of our good gaming panels and actually that that thing's picking up.

534
00:28:00,191 --> 00:28:01,729
Rym: I could see it going places not very good.

535
00:28:02,111 --> 00:28:04,221
Rym: I don't know if we'll ever have time to do Torah con again.

536
00:28:04,241 --> 00:28:05,286
Rym: I like Torah con.

537
00:28:05,306 --> 00:28:06,290
Rym: It's just it's too far away.

538
00:28:06,492 --> 00:28:08,030
Scott: I can't go back to Rochester.

539
00:28:08,612 --> 00:28:12,790
Scott: Maybe if I'm got like mad extra vacation days and mad extra money's I could use the jet blue.

540
00:28:13,372 --> 00:28:15,358
Rym: Yeah, it's just more and more.

541
00:28:15,398 --> 00:28:17,043
Rym: all my reasons to go back to Rochester.

542
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:18,788
Rym: I've moved away from Rochester.

543
00:28:19,009 --> 00:28:23,565
Scott: Yep Okay, so main bit Pokemon adventures.

544
00:28:23,705 --> 00:28:26,960
Scott: Oh snap Gotta catch them all bitches.

545
00:28:27,101 --> 00:28:28,630
Rym: It's real simple, but I learned something.

546
00:28:28,731 --> 00:28:30,970
Rym: I learned something that has changed everything.

547
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,154
Rym: But I'll get to that in a second.

548
00:28:32,776 --> 00:28:36,850
Rym: if you liked the Pokemon games the actual games on Nintendo.

549
00:28:37,031 --> 00:28:39,150
Scott: Yep, not not like any of those other Pokemon.

550
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,333
Scott: You know it's weird.

551
00:28:40,394 --> 00:28:44,144
Scott: Pokemon is a strange thing in that there's sort of like this core right.

552
00:28:44,365 --> 00:28:49,029
Scott: the core is the original Series of games for the Gameboy slash DS.

553
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:52,610
Scott: You know Pokemon red blue green the ones that are just colors.

554
00:28:52,951 --> 00:29:02,240
Scott: You know not Pokemon snap not Pokemon troze a Pokemon pinball not Pokemon mystery dungeon Just plain old Pokemon color any color.

555
00:29:02,481 --> 00:29:02,702
Scott: right.

556
00:29:02,983 --> 00:29:13,301
Scott: that main series of games is like the core and it's great and a lot of that extra stuff is sort of nay right and You know with the Pokemon anime.

557
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:15,190
Scott: Yeah, whatever right okay?

558
00:29:15,852 --> 00:29:23,029
Scott: It has some aspects that are good, but really eh right and you know most Pokemon manga is bleh.

559
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,660
Rym: well I'm not even gonna say bleh.

560
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,910
Rym: I think it's more simple.

561
00:29:26,492 --> 00:29:31,150
Rym: It's all very different from the core of Pokemon exactly like it's kind of like all those Carcassonne expansions.

562
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:35,170
Rym: You just tacked down around the side of this completely separate original thing.

563
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:41,054
Scott: Yeah, and Pokemon is a strange thing because you expect Pokemon to be like this kitty sort of thing And you know what it is.

564
00:29:41,215 --> 00:29:45,913
Scott: all that tacked on stuff is exactly the stereotype of what you would think Pokemon is.

565
00:29:46,475 --> 00:29:59,730
Scott: but the core Pokemon stuff the core series of video games and This manga which is pretty much the only other thing that I consider to be in the Pokemon core are the real deal Not just silly kitty stuff.

566
00:30:00,171 --> 00:30:05,324
Rym: I mean basically if you enjoy the Pokemon games you should read this manga.

567
00:30:05,425 --> 00:30:06,628
Rym: make sure you get the right one.

568
00:30:06,908 --> 00:30:09,175
Scott: Pokemon Adventures, that's it.

569
00:30:09,335 --> 00:30:11,662
Scott: It's not called Pokemon color.

570
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:13,206
Scott: It's not called anything else.

571
00:30:13,267 --> 00:30:14,430
Scott: It's just Pokemon adventures.

572
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:14,852
Scott: That's it.

573
00:30:15,434 --> 00:30:15,736
Scott: That's the.

574
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:19,050
Scott: that's how you know it's the right one and Viz recently reprinted.

575
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:22,612
Scott: It's he back in the day right back in like the early 2000s I think.

576
00:30:22,692 --> 00:30:25,870
Scott: Viz printed this in the US and they printed in these big books.

577
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,201
Scott: They were like full-size there, but they were thin.

578
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:30,170
Scott: it was like one chapter and one trade paper.

579
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,718
Rym: I remember Luke had them all at RIT.

580
00:30:31,738 --> 00:30:32,402
Rym: That's how we read it.

581
00:30:32,763 --> 00:30:36,088
Scott: Yeah, so Luke is like oh my god You got to read this Pokemon manga, and we're like what?

582
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,670
Scott: And we read it and we're like oh shit.

583
00:30:39,052 --> 00:30:41,946
Scott: But it was published sort of like as almost like a coloring book.

584
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:44,189
Scott: so we're like what the fuck You know is with this printing format.

585
00:30:44,581 --> 00:30:59,410
Scott: Yeah And then eventually right now like as of like a month or two ago Viz finally reprinting this original Pokemon adventures manga in the you know Manga digest format, so it's actually in an accessible book.

586
00:30:59,771 --> 00:31:01,900
Scott: It's only eight dollars per book.

587
00:31:01,981 --> 00:31:04,009
Scott: and let's see this book has volume two.

588
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:07,785
Scott: How many pages are in this guy for eight bucks and try to find a page number?

589
00:31:08,348 --> 00:31:08,870
Scott: It doesn't matter.

590
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:14,466
Scott: It's a lot of freaking pages at least 200 something more than 200 pages of manga for $8.

591
00:31:14,466 --> 00:31:15,770
Scott: That's a good deal right there.

592
00:31:16,412 --> 00:31:17,980
Rym: Well depends on the manga, but for this one.

593
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,210
Scott: definitely this one is definitely the real deal now.

594
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:25,890
Rym: It was originally put up by Shogakukan and in the not I think 1996 1997.

595
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:26,995
Scott: Oh, it's an old manga.

596
00:31:27,397 --> 00:31:27,819
Rym: Oh, man.

597
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:28,944
Rym: We're so old.

598
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,330
Rym: so oh my god.

599
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:33,305
Scott: That's actually kind of interesting because I mean we were reading it in the US.

600
00:31:33,345 --> 00:31:38,010
Scott: and what like oh 102. so it took less than like you know five years for it to get over.

601
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,839
Rym: Yeah, it is interesting how this.

602
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,869
Rym: there's the weird nostalgia factor where?

603
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:50,950
Rym: Pokemon is both a lot older than you think and yet not nearly as old as original Pokemon was for the original Gameboy.

604
00:31:51,873 --> 00:31:52,475
Rym: But it's weird.

605
00:31:52,516 --> 00:31:54,844
Rym: not even Gameboy color just Gameboy my whole like.

606
00:31:55,245 --> 00:32:01,090
Rym: I think of what I cannot Consider or imagine or remember the point at which I became aware of Pokemon.

607
00:32:01,231 --> 00:32:03,239
Scott: I do I remember exactly what I feel as though.

608
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:05,830
Rym: I was always aware of Pokemon and the Pokemon always existed.

609
00:32:05,931 --> 00:32:09,289
Scott: No, I remember exactly when because I was reading my game Pro magazines, right?

610
00:32:10,451 --> 00:32:13,466
Scott: There was you know suddenly there was all this stuff about Pokemon, and I was like.

611
00:32:13,486 --> 00:32:16,518
Scott: I was like Why are they pushing this kid's game Pokemon?

612
00:32:16,538 --> 00:32:16,980
Scott: whatever?

613
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,770
Scott: right and I kept skipping over all the Pokemon stuff.

614
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:24,584
Scott: Just be like whatever whatever and eventually of course my brother who had the Nintendo power right.

615
00:32:25,165 --> 00:32:27,232
Scott: he got the Pokemon for his Gameboy Pocket.

616
00:32:27,694 --> 00:32:29,441
Scott: Gameboy Pocket, but you don't remember that guy.

617
00:32:29,502 --> 00:32:30,265
Scott: I remember that guy.

618
00:32:30,305 --> 00:32:31,350
Scott: Gameboy Pocket was great.

619
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,517
Rym: You know I didn't buy that shit.

620
00:32:32,739 --> 00:32:34,430
Rym: at a game gear was already in color.

621
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:38,170
Rym: Yeah, Gameboy Pocket wasn't in color wasn't but it had that it had a much better screen.

622
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:38,392
Rym: It was.

623
00:32:38,493 --> 00:32:45,585
Scott: my pocket was basically original Gameboy only Smaller had more battery life with two triple-a batteries instead of four double is.

624
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:48,555
Scott: the screen was green was bigger And the device was smaller.

625
00:32:48,816 --> 00:32:50,081
Rym: also not only was the screen bigger.

626
00:32:50,141 --> 00:32:51,505
Rym: That wasn't the biggest deal.

627
00:32:51,806 --> 00:32:54,793
Rym: It was high contrast And white.

628
00:32:54,914 --> 00:32:58,225
Scott: yeah think about the Gameboy Micro, that's what the Gameboy Pocket was.

629
00:32:58,245 --> 00:32:59,590
Scott: it was like that only worth it.

630
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:10,609
Rym: I mean the Gameboy Pocket like I. As a kid I remember dismissing it until a friend of mine had it And I saw it and I realized that you could have colors other than drab lime to darker drab lime.

631
00:33:10,629 --> 00:33:18,480
Scott: Yeah Anyway, so my brother got the Pokemon for the Gameboy Pocket And then I had the Gameboy Color soon after and I was just like our.

632
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,065
Scott: I saw the Pokemon.

633
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:25,880
Scott: I was like oh wow That's actually like oh That's what that.

634
00:33:26,365 --> 00:33:30,430
Scott: oh, oh I thought it was some kiddie thing all along like whatever.

635
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:32,846
Scott: I just dismissed it and skipped over it didn't read about it.

636
00:33:33,449 --> 00:33:36,205
Scott: once I saw what it was I was like oh fuck me now.

637
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:36,950
Rym: We got the Pokemon.

638
00:33:37,132 --> 00:33:38,510
Rym: We keep saying it's the real deal.

639
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:43,687
Rym: But there is solid evidence for this to the point that the quote is like all over the internet.

640
00:33:43,727 --> 00:33:44,470
Rym: It's on Wikipedia.

641
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:55,061
Rym: They're like a million citations for it, but Satoshi Tajiri the guy who created Pokemon mm-hmm He said and I quote Boku got to tie a takata.

642
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:57,850
Rym: Seki no moto mocha Kai manga desk, huh?

643
00:33:58,531 --> 00:34:00,858
Rym: This is the comic that most resembles the world.

644
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:01,882
Rym: I was trying to convey.

645
00:34:02,102 --> 00:34:12,281
Rym: Yeah, I mean if you look right at say I only said the Japanese because they pointedly put the Japanese in the Wikipedia To make sure that no one argues about the translation or anything.

646
00:34:12,442 --> 00:34:19,710
Scott: Wow so anyway if you look at the original Pokemon Gameboy game right that that was the first ever Pokemon ever was that Gameboy game.

647
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,194
Scott: There was no Pokemon before that.

648
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:21,676
Scott: that was it.

649
00:34:22,357 --> 00:34:27,092
Scott: then look at say the anime for example right and compare that to the original video Game.

650
00:34:27,534 --> 00:34:28,900
Scott: there's a lot of big differences.

651
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,230
Scott: I mean like Pikachu's his first Pokemon It's like no in the Gameboy game.

652
00:34:33,473 --> 00:34:37,563
Scott: He gets you know either You know Charmander Squirtle or Bulbasaur.

653
00:34:37,704 --> 00:34:40,357
Scott: first Pikachu comes later And that's only if you get one.

654
00:34:40,377 --> 00:34:42,326
Scott: you don't have to get a peek at you if you don't want to.

655
00:34:42,567 --> 00:34:43,824
Scott: it's kind of hard To skip it though.

656
00:34:44,992 --> 00:34:48,533
Scott: You know and there's like the story, and he's not ash Ketchum He's you.

657
00:34:48,614 --> 00:34:50,704
Scott: you name him, but the default name is red.

658
00:34:50,824 --> 00:34:54,159
Scott: cuz he's the red guy and the right There's a rival and his default name is blue.

659
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:56,150
Rym: There's also yellow the yellow Caballero.

660
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,193
Rym: Yeah, that's the fucking man.

661
00:34:57,213 --> 00:35:00,223
Scott: yellow caviar rocks at the house, but it's like you know.

662
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:06,963
Scott: Brock and misty don't follow you around Right you know you just fight them once and that gets the end of them.

663
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:14,156
Scott: also in them in this manga misty Badass and Team Rocket in the ma in the Gameboy game Badass scary dudes.

664
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:16,445
Scott: in the anime you got like that Jesse and James.

665
00:35:16,505 --> 00:35:17,810
Scott: silly nonsense going on.

666
00:35:18,272 --> 00:35:19,737
Scott: So you know the anime.

667
00:35:19,797 --> 00:35:25,920
Scott: while it has many similarities with the original you know Gameboy game It is you know very much a diversion.

668
00:35:26,101 --> 00:35:27,707
Scott: right actually interesting thing.

669
00:35:27,787 --> 00:35:34,050
Scott: right in The anime right the main characters name in the u.s.. Is ash Ketchum right and the rival is what Gary?

670
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:34,511
Scott: I think.

671
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:37,558
Rym: yep well the thing is I know you're going with this.

672
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,614
Rym: in the original Japanese the names were actually Shigeru and Satoshi.

673
00:35:43,956 --> 00:35:47,310
Rym: you know the names of Miyamoto and the guy who created Pokemon.

674
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:49,599
Scott: That's in the anime though in the Gameboy game.

675
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:50,342
Scott: It was red and blue.

676
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:50,623
Scott: Yep.

677
00:35:50,763 --> 00:35:54,469
Scott: Yep, so yeah That's that was sort of interesting to find that out.

678
00:35:55,113 --> 00:36:08,261
Rym: Now anyway I talked earlier about something that blew my mind and like this is like one of those puzzle pieces that fell out into my lap from the internet, and it looks legit and It answers every like question.

679
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:09,606
Rym: everything fell into focus.

680
00:36:09,686 --> 00:36:13,341
Rym: I now understand Everything there is to understand about Pokemon.

681
00:36:13,662 --> 00:36:23,602
Rym: Yep, the guy who created Pokemon Satoshi Tajiri, so when he was a kid as a young boy He lived in Mashida near Tokyo, and he liked to collect bugs.

682
00:36:23,622 --> 00:36:24,365
Rym: all right.

683
00:36:24,846 --> 00:36:26,348
Rym: He just collected bugs Yep.

684
00:36:26,691 --> 00:36:32,875
Rym: So eventually all the places he used to go to collect bugs were paved over and turned into apartments And he was sad.

685
00:36:33,195 --> 00:36:37,870
Rym: so he eventually wanted to make a game where people could relive that and collect bugs.

686
00:36:38,092 --> 00:36:40,050
Rym: He succeeded much in the same way that Miyamoto.

687
00:36:40,191 --> 00:36:41,741
Rym: You know what was Legend of Zelda.

688
00:36:41,801 --> 00:36:45,825
Rym: he used to wander through the woods as a kid And he wanted to recreate that sense of exploration and wonder.

689
00:36:45,946 --> 00:36:46,630
Scott: I had a great idea.

690
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:49,881
Scott: I'll tell you after the show, but anyway I'll wait to leave listeners hanging.

691
00:36:49,922 --> 00:36:51,110
Scott: so what it Rym?

692
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:55,644
Scott: Tell me what was there something you did as a kid that you now want to recreate and recapture?

693
00:36:55,664 --> 00:36:57,590
Rym: uh play DOS games.

694
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:08,530
Rym: I Installed fucking tie fighter.

695
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,054
Scott: You know we should do.

696
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:15,530
Scott: we should make a video game that sort of recreates the experience of installing and uninstalling games in DOS.

697
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,430
Scott: That's a good idea.

698
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,314
Scott: And that's all it is.

699
00:37:17,354 --> 00:37:23,290
Scott: is like you know just as you pretend to install and uninstall games to keep your DOS disk We can make it in the don't shit your pants style.

700
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:29,688
Rym: Then you have to make boot disks and everything instead of don't shit your pants It's don't break your computer and make tie fighter work now.

701
00:37:30,771 --> 00:37:35,693
Rym: Anyway, so the piece of the puzzle where it all came together Nintendo.

702
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,235
Rym: he was called.

703
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:41,193
Rym: the guy was called reclusive and eccentric by people at Nintendo, but very creative Turns out.

704
00:37:41,574 --> 00:37:44,022
Rym: the creator of Pokemon had Asperger's.

705
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:44,945
Scott: Oh really.

706
00:37:45,105 --> 00:37:46,349
Scott: That's a surprise now.

707
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:48,380
Scott: So the OCD also.

708
00:37:48,621 --> 00:37:51,435
Rym: I'm not sure but suddenly Everything tamale.

709
00:37:51,455 --> 00:37:53,563
Rym: you know everything about Pokemon makes sense.

710
00:37:53,623 --> 00:37:55,430
Rym: Yeah, absolutely everything anyway.

711
00:37:55,571 --> 00:38:01,950
Scott: Well, we're talking about Pokemon adventures this manga Which is written by he didn't or a kusaka and the art is by motto.

712
00:38:02,372 --> 00:38:04,300
Scott: I guess a person with one name like sting.

713
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,067
Rym: I read that just the coloring was done by motto.

714
00:38:06,268 --> 00:38:08,396
Rym: Uh-huh well That's the I'm really I'm not sure.

715
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:14,918
Scott: I'm looking at the front of the cover of the viz volume 2 Which is story by he didn't or a kusaka art by motto.

716
00:38:15,038 --> 00:38:16,943
Scott: so take from that what you will.

717
00:38:17,164 --> 00:38:19,570
Scott: Satoshi Yamamoto this manga.

718
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:27,530
Rym: Basically as someone who has played I see what happened motto did the first nine volumes and then other people took over after that.

719
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:35,083
Scott: Uh-huh as someone who has played the video games and read this manga This manga is basically a manga version of the video game.

720
00:38:35,164 --> 00:38:42,749
Scott: like it is so dead-on You know in the in the way it feels the way the story goes and everything and so the thing is.

721
00:38:42,789 --> 00:38:49,249
Scott: of course It's more fleshed out because the video game you know Doesn't have a lot of filler in it in terms of lots and lots of text.

722
00:38:49,812 --> 00:38:51,679
Scott: you know it only has a little bit when you talk to people.

723
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:59,037
Scott: so this sort of takes the shell of the story of the Video game and keeps everything that's in there in there And then just sort of fills in the gaps.

724
00:38:59,459 --> 00:39:00,704
Scott: it adds a little bit to like.

725
00:39:00,724 --> 00:39:06,530
Scott: there's a new character green Who's the girl who's totally awesome, and there's a couple other slight differences?

726
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:07,893
Scott: But they fit in.

727
00:39:07,934 --> 00:39:13,310
Scott: they don't like stand out as like you know being out of place like the way ash Ketchum does you know?

728
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:14,875
Scott: This is totally right.

729
00:39:14,956 --> 00:39:18,609
Scott: along with you know the feel and how those games go.

730
00:39:19,198 --> 00:39:19,849
Scott: It's totally great.

731
00:39:21,071 --> 00:39:25,930
Scott: The thing that I like about it the most I think is that you know an Earthsea right the Wizard of Earthsea.

732
00:39:26,354 --> 00:39:36,495
Scott: It's like you read book one It's about Ged right and then like you read the rest of the books and get is sort of like becomes this legendary figure And he's not really around.

733
00:39:36,515 --> 00:39:39,444
Scott: I mean he's kind of around, but he's not really really around.

734
00:39:39,484 --> 00:39:40,868
Scott: he's become this legendary figure.

735
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:41,330
Scott: right.

736
00:39:42,331 --> 00:39:44,177
Scott: these Pokemon books go the same way.

737
00:39:44,258 --> 00:39:47,669
Scott: the first few volumes are about red the original Pokemon guy

738
00:39:47,689 --> 00:39:47,749
Rym: and

739
00:39:48,772 --> 00:40:01,110
Scott: then you read yellow Caballero which comes after that and Red is now sort of like this mysterious legendary figure But you know all about him because you read those other volumes, but now he's all legendary and mysterious, and it's totally awesome.

740
00:40:01,253 --> 00:40:01,848
Scott: I love that shit.

741
00:40:02,472 --> 00:40:04,860
Scott: You know I think that other stories need to do more.

742
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:10,850
Scott: that like you know you read Lord of the Rings and Merlin is sort Of he's there, but he's still sort of mysterious, right?

743
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:16,848
Scott: They should have had the story of Merlin first and then do the Lord of the Rings where Merlin's all mysterious.

744
00:40:16,888 --> 00:40:20,082
Scott: that way You get that same feeling you get in Pokemon Earthsea.

745
00:40:20,645 --> 00:40:21,348
Rym: Well regardless.

746
00:40:21,408 --> 00:40:27,747
Rym: I just The game and the comic give me the same feeling actually that earthbound does.

747
00:40:27,787 --> 00:40:28,489
Rym: there's this very.

748
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:38,330
Rym: you know Earthbound is very Pokemon it is But just the idea the journey of the child through the adult world through the eyes of a child and with the priorities of a child.

749
00:40:38,832 --> 00:40:45,194
Rym: But yet, it's an adult world that the child is traveling through and that Mystique to a child.

750
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:51,957
Rym: I think that is what made Pokemon and earthbound while mother just so amazingly Transcendently popular among kids.

751
00:40:52,038 --> 00:40:55,130
Scott: Yeah, what else is pretty great about this Pokemon?

752
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,035
Scott: Right is that you look at some of the other Pokemon.

753
00:40:57,055 --> 00:41:01,750
Scott: things like especially Pokemon movies concentrate a lot on the Pokemon themselves.

754
00:41:01,891 --> 00:41:03,583
Scott: You know on the monsters and catching them all.

755
00:41:03,623 --> 00:41:04,469
Rym: he's got Gyarados.

756
00:41:04,489 --> 00:41:06,679
Rym: well I have squirtles and I'll do the blah.

757
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,990
Scott: or even like you'll see scenes where it's just Pokemon.

Rym: Probably my favorite parts though are all toward the end.

784
00:42:30,341 --> 00:42:34,854
Rym: You know Team Rocket is a serious scary Pseudoterrorist organization.

785
00:42:34,934 --> 00:42:35,958
Scott: yeah, that's what I love that.

786
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:39,250

Rym: Yeah, Jesus.

788
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,842
Scott: He actually appears here in volume two.

789
00:42:43,183 --> 00:42:43,604
Scott: is it great?

790
00:42:43,624 --> 00:42:49,387

Scott: Oh shit.

796
00:43:01,967 --> 00:43:08,978
Rym: He's Team Rocket Oh, but the fact that Team Rocket is more like this mafia organization like this evil That's the thing seriously evil.

797
00:43:09,018 --> 00:43:18,043
Scott: if you look to Team Rocket in the original video game You know you didn't know much about them other than that they were bad guys and what they looked like and they all looked Like bad guys.

798
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:21,564
Scott: they would wear black You know evil kind of suits, and they'd be up to no good.

799
00:43:21,584 --> 00:43:24,480
Scott: and in the manga They're even more evil and up to even more.

800
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,948
Rym: no, but they're up to realistic.

801
00:43:26,008 --> 00:43:27,154
Rym: No good They're trying to do.

802
00:43:27,475 --> 00:43:30,550
Rym: you know the kinds of things that mafias do just in a world where they're a Pokemon.

803
00:43:30,671 --> 00:43:39,834
Scott: Yeah, they want to get Pokemon and make them all powerful And and you know do all sorts of evil stuff with them take over towns and smash things and threaten people and you know all That sort of evil stuff.

804
00:43:39,854 --> 00:43:41,280
Scott: They have an evil corporation.

805
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,645
Scott: That's a front for their mafia.

806
00:43:42,665 --> 00:43:53,050
Rym: miss yep This manga is at least the beginning of it The story of red and his you know youthful idealism and him fighting against Team Rocket And it culminates in the like the whole story.

807
00:43:53,392 --> 00:43:55,381
Scott: He's just trying to become like you know like the.

808
00:43:55,542 --> 00:43:57,090
Scott: you know this great Pokemon train.

809
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:06,662
Scott: Yes, but he gets embroiled get all the badges, but then you know along the way He can't help but keep bumping into Team Rocket And then Team Rocket's coming after him at the same time and so it's a big mess.

810
00:44:07,084 --> 00:44:12,767
Rym: it just I like the whole the first Saga how that all ends with Giovanni and him and everything is just amazing.

811
00:44:13,048 --> 00:44:13,510
Scott: It's very me.

812
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:15,639
Rym: This is a good manga, and I shall just read it.

813
00:44:15,699 --> 00:44:18,130
Scott: I mean it's Viz kids right, but don't be put off.

814
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:21,407
Scott: I mean it is appropriate for kids obviously, but don't be thinking.

815
00:44:21,447 --> 00:44:21,930
Scott: It's kiddie.

816
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:31,390
Scott: I mean there's shit going down in here like people's getting arms get chopped off or like Pokemon get cut up And they bite people and it's it's friggin hard dangerous world.

817
00:44:32,033 --> 00:44:32,716
Scott: Yeah, I mean friggin.

818
00:44:33,018 --> 00:44:34,143
Scott: as a giant Pokemon.

819
00:44:34,183 --> 00:44:37,950
Scott: if it steps on you You're dead, but the thing is don't be fooled.

820
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:49,289
Rym: You know when you've just start reading the manga the first volume it starts out on the same level I'd say as that Legend of Zelda manga like it's kind of light-hearted, and it is kind of kiddie at first And it it's also of his kids title.

821
00:44:49,309 --> 00:44:54,209
Rym: yeah But it definitely progresses and progresses and gets darker and more serious and more cool as time goes on.

822
00:44:54,269 --> 00:45:00,115
Rym: and By the end of the first story arc with red and then when you move on to yellow You'll see what we're talking about.

823
00:45:00,135 --> 00:45:01,540
Rym: you'll see why we like this so much.

824
00:45:01,841 --> 00:45:09,920
Scott: the other thing is that plot wise it skips over a Lot of sort of like the fiddly BS that like other Pokemon things will pay attention to right like you.

825
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,170
Scott: don't see him catch every single freaking Pokemon.

826
00:45:12,311 --> 00:45:14,079
Scott: You know it's like they'll sort of skip ahead.

827
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:14,400
Scott: He's like.

828
00:45:14,681 --> 00:45:14,882
Scott: You know.

829
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,650
Scott: Oh, yeah, this you know I you know There'll be one chapter.

830
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:18,916
Scott: He's got like three Pokemon.

831
00:45:18,956 --> 00:45:21,890
Scott: the next chapter have like eight and you'll see ones that weren't there.

832
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:24,742
Scott: You just sort of assume that he caught them in the meantime, and he did.

833
00:45:25,144 --> 00:45:26,650
Scott: and that's that you don't need to see that.

834
00:45:26,832 --> 00:45:28,009
Scott: You know what's the what's the deal?

835
00:45:28,611 --> 00:45:35,945
Scott: You know it moves in a very nice pace as a result as opposed to getting bogged up And you know where you watch him throw a bokeh ball.

836
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:36,629
Scott: It didn't work.

837
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:38,275
Scott: Pokeball didn't work.

838
00:45:38,698 --> 00:45:40,508
