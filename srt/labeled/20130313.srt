1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,470
Rym: It's Wednesday, March 13th, 2013.

2
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,590
Rym: I'm Rym, I've got Emily here, and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:30,590
Rym: Tonight, Scott is not here, so I can talk as long as I fucking want at the beginning of the show, telling a gigantic title about how we're going to review Mama Rojoza's Wolf Children, a fantastic movie that we just saw in the theater.

4
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:32,648
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:38,650
Rym: So we're pretty much busy trying to get ready for PAX, which is, I believe, next weekend.

6
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,842
Rym: I think it is next weekend, because this episode's actually going up the time.

7
00:00:41,862 --> 00:00:43,710
Rym: we're recording it instead of way ahead of time.

8
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:49,290
Rym: But the end result is Scott is at home and not in the studio, so we have a guess.

9
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,883
Emily: I thought he was mentoring today.

10
00:00:51,903 --> 00:00:53,270
Emily: He's doing his mentor thing.

11
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:57,850
Rym: Yeah, but he was supposed to do the show yesterday, and we didn't do it for other reasons, unrelated.

12
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:58,613
Emily: Right, right.

13
00:00:58,894 --> 00:01:13,270
Emily: Well, anyway, this is kind of an experiment, because it's weird, because usually when I'm on the show, it's the three-person conversation with, like, "Wim and Scott got the banter going," and then I'll chime in occasionally with my opinions or whatever I have to say about various comics.

14
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,610
Rym: That different kind of banter this time.

15
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:25,249
Emily: Yeah, I feel kind of awkward, because I'm so used to having, like, these one-on-one conversations with Wim, but I, you know, I haven't had six years or seven years or whatever worth of recording it, so it's kind of like...

16
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:31,430
Rym: You're not used to talking to me when I'm facing the other direction, fiddling with knobs, and scratching myself most of the time.

17
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,703
Emily: No, I'm, like, staring at your ponytail right now.

18
00:01:33,743 --> 00:01:34,930
Emily: I'm staring right at your back.

19
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:40,710
Emily: And so, like, the whole episode, you're gonna just feel these eye beams boring into you, like, Emily's staring at me.

20
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,469
Emily: I feel the sweat.

21
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:51,370
Rym: I've realized that I kind of... maybe I'm just vain, but a lot of listeners, whenever there's a video or anything of us, they always refer to my mane, and that goes back to even before My Little Pony.

22
00:01:51,410 --> 00:02:04,930
Emily: No, seriously, when you, like, shake your hair loose, when your hair is loose and, like, flopping around, then it looks very full, and it looks mane-like, so I feel like, at least when you wear it down, it merits the term

23
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:05,090
Emily: "mane.".

24
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,669
Rym: Well, that video where the demon horse at our first packs hit me in the junk.

25
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,574
Emily: That was awesome!

26
00:02:09,595 --> 00:02:12,390
Emily: Well, not the hitting in the junk, but, like, your hair is flying everywhere.

27
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,226
Rym: And basically, this dude's just like, "Oh my god, that guy's mane is longer than the

28
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:15,468
Rym: horse's.".

29
00:02:16,413 --> 00:02:19,009
Rym: And then the horse hits me in the junk right after Scott stops recording.

30
00:02:19,811 --> 00:02:21,640
Emily: That was the packs I didn't go to, right?

31
00:02:21,681 --> 00:02:23,350
Emily: That was, like, Dante's Inferno.

32
00:02:23,751 --> 00:02:29,690
Rym: That was back when special guests, like me and Scott, actually got weird perks, like, we got to get into the expo hall.

33
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,897
Emily: Half an hour, like, guess what?

34
00:02:31,957 --> 00:02:32,860
Emily: Guess what, Rym?

35
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,690
Emily: Know how else you can get one of those rare perks?

36
00:02:36,134 --> 00:02:36,950
Rym: Uh, by enforcing?

37
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:38,370
Emily: No, be a game developer.

38
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,773
Emily: Ahh.

39
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,462
Emily: So, I'm doing, like, the triple threat this year.

40
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:42,709
Emily: I'm going as an attendee.

41
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:48,730
Emily: I'm, um, we've got a booth in the NDA Mega Booth for Guns of Icarus, so I'm gonna be doing a little bit of boothing.

42
00:02:49,392 --> 00:02:52,230
Emily: And I'm enforcing, so, uh, it's gonna be pretty great.

43
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,370
Rym: I'm a special guest, and I'm an attendee, but I am not a developer.

44
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,810
Emily: Yeah, the guest part I haven't tried, but I've tried the other bits, and they're pretty awesome.

45
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,310
Emily: Packs is, like, hands down my favorite convention.

46
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:13,466
Emily: Like, I don't know if I've been on the show to geek out about it as much, I mean, they constantly, like, for six months before packs, as soon as the one packs ends, they're like, "Oh my god, six months before packs

47
00:03:13,507 --> 00:03:14,089
Emily: feast!".

48
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:17,429
Rym: And then six months till packs, it's a six mod six.

49
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,950
Emily: Yeah, it's one of those things where they're amped up pretty much constantly about packs.

50
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:30,190
Emily: But yeah, I think, you know, I've always been kinda lukewarm on conventions, partly 'cause I get kinda overwhelmed in very loud social environments.

51
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,590
Rym: You don't drink as heavily as I used to at cons, either.

52
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,190
Emily: Well, that's part of it, like, but also, I'm not a sustained partier.

53
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:44,650
Emily: Like, I really enjoy the social engagement, and I really enjoy parties and stuff, but only for, like, four hours at a stretch, you know?

54
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:49,225
Emily: I think three days it gets a bit much, and I kinda just wanna curl up in a corner with a book and be like,

55
00:03:49,265 --> 00:03:49,486
Emily: "Whoa!".

56
00:03:50,790 --> 00:04:03,847
Rym: The entire, the front-room crew would go to, you know, anime cons every year, like, Katsu-Con and Otakon, those are big things, like, every year we'd all go, and then the one year we all went to packs, and then pretty much everyone we know.

57
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,607
Emily: We were just like, "Whatever anime

58
00:04:05,627 --> 00:04:05,809
Emily: cons.".

59
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:11,070
Rym: Yeah, now the anime cons are just like me and Scott and maybe you, and almost no one else we know goes anymore.

60
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:16,469
Emily: Actually, I'm kind of psyched for Anime Boston, 'cause that's the first big anime con I've gone to.

61
00:04:16,891 --> 00:04:23,310
Emily: If I go, like, if I get my panel, it's gonna be the first one I've gone to in quite some time.

62
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:31,038
Rym: Yeah, Anime Boston's, and last year we didn't go, except to show up for exactly two hours to do two panels back-to-back, and then we immediately left.

63
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:33,170
Rym: I didn't even go to the artist alley.

64
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:44,530
Emily: I went to the artist alley, and the artist alley's pretty good, but it's like, I came and dropped off the DVD, and got the stink eye from the guy who's manning the room, because I was like, "Yeah, we bailed on you

65
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,650
Emily: guys.".

66
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,774
Emily: Yeah, never forget, guys.

67
00:04:46,236 --> 00:04:49,930
Rym: We performed live via DVD at Anime Boston last year.

68
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,417
Emily: That's not performing live!

69
00:04:51,477 --> 00:04:54,170
Rym: That's like the opposite of performing live!

70
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,710
Rym: It was a live performance that was then recorded and replayed, but the performance itself was live.

71
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,170
Emily: I thought to do something live, it had to be real-time streaming.

72
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,730
Rym: But if I watch a recording of a soccer event, was that not a live event that I'm now watching again?

73
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,982
Emily: It was a live event, but you weren't watching it live.

74
00:05:11,504 --> 00:05:12,950
Emily: It wasn't coming to you live.

75
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:15,450
Emily: A live feed means it's currently active.

76
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:22,270
Rym: Though in this case, there would have been no difference and no way for the audience to tell, because we don't actually interact with the audience ever.

77
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:23,553
Emily: That's the thing.

78
00:05:23,593 --> 00:05:36,809
Emily: You could have played it like, "Oh, we just don't have a microphone, so we can't hear you, but we're streaming to you live," or something, even though you'd be totally BSing, and I'd have to hide the DVD and be like, "Yeah, yeah, satellite feed,

79
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:37,010
Emily: seriously.".

80
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,289
Rym: We could have been there in person, and people wouldn't know that we were there live.

81
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:42,569
Emily: Yeah, they're just holograms.

82
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:51,190
Rym: The other main reason Scott's not on the show now is that he didn't pirate wolf children and watch it when he had the chance, and he didn't buy tickets to the Children's Film Festival.

83
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,936
Emily: Yeah, I warned him ahead of time.

84
00:05:52,996 --> 00:05:55,827
Emily: I was just like, "It's funny, because this is one of...".

85
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,550
Emily: Actually, it is probably my favorite film festival that happens in New York City every year.

86
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,410
Rym: I get super excited every year.

87
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:09,585
Emily: It's like, I try to tell people, "New York International Children's Film Festival," because I'm a grown-up, and they're like, "Really?

88
00:06:09,605 --> 00:06:10,108
Emily: I don't

89
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:10,389
Emily: know.".

90
00:06:10,691 --> 00:06:11,657
Emily: I'm like, "No, seriously.

91
00:06:11,697 --> 00:06:13,045
Emily: It's the best animation

92
00:06:13,086 --> 00:06:13,468
Emily: festival.".

93
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:14,856
Emily: But it's true.

94
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:20,050
Emily: It's got a mix of shorts, and you can go to the short screening, and you can also see all these animated features.

95
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,290
Emily: And they also have a few live-action things.

96
00:06:24,112 --> 00:06:34,610
Emily: But it's like any international animated feature that is worth a damn, they're probably going to screen it at the Children's Film Festival in New York.

97
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:42,770
Emily: So it's cool, too, because they must have a lot of pretty smart kids, because most of the films are subtitled.

98
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:52,530
Rym: Guys, the questions these little five-, six-, seven-year-old kids ask the directors at these things are way better than anything you've ever asked at an anime con of a guest.

99
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,000
Emily: Yeah, I mean, they're still kids.

100
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,781
Emily: They're definitely like... We'll get to that later, the first question.

101
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:59,088
Emily: they asked the director.

102
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:03,125
Rym: The kid was just like, "Why was the movie so

103
00:07:03,206 --> 00:07:04,029
Rym: depressing?".

104
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:06,357
Emily: The director was there.

105
00:07:06,377 --> 00:07:18,850
Emily: He was doing a Q&A session with the audience, and he was just like, "Well, trust me, if you watch it when you're older, try watching this movie when you're 20, and then maybe you won't find it depressing.

106
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,121
Emily: Maybe you'll have a different

107
00:07:20,182 --> 00:07:20,707
Emily: experience.".

108
00:07:21,811 --> 00:07:35,118
Emily: I really like... This is the second time I've gone to see and met Mamoru Hosoda, and every time he seems like a very patient person, but he's nice.

109
00:07:35,138 --> 00:07:36,705
Emily: He seems nice, you know?

110
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:37,930
Emily: Very interesting.

111
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,509
Rym: He gives good and direct answers, too.

112
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,189
Emily: Yeah, it's like you feel like he's not doing the PR, BS-ing kind of thing.

113
00:07:45,811 --> 00:07:51,889
Rym: Not like the, "Well, I was inspired by many of the people I worked with in my time at the

114
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:52,350
Rym: studio.".

115
00:07:52,752 --> 00:08:01,970
Emily: It's like, you know, I kind of compare it to when Jeffrey Katzenberg, who was like the head of DreamWorks, came to our animation class one day.

116
00:08:02,474 --> 00:08:04,249
Emily: They had a big event where he came to school.

117
00:08:06,574 --> 00:08:16,790
Emily: You can really tell the heads of the big companies versus the artists, where they'll give very, I don't know, kind of advertising answers.

118
00:08:19,037 --> 00:08:22,370
Emily: Not saying a lot, but still trying to sound exciting.

119
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:26,670
Emily: I mean, it just wasn't a frank conversation.

120
00:08:27,491 --> 00:08:39,669
Emily: That's one thing I liked about Makoto Shinkai, too, is he was actually even more direct, kind of like, "Yeah, that kind of was a tough thing," and et cetera, et cetera.

121
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:50,097
Rym: And you can see the interview with him because apparently I was the only journalist in the room with a camera when he was interviewed at the New York anime festival.

122
00:08:50,117 --> 00:08:51,146
Rym: To me, that's a crime.

123
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,669
Rym: Well, the New York Comic-Con.

124
00:08:53,435 --> 00:08:54,689
Rym: I didn't even expect to record it.

125
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,410
Rym: I literally went there because I wanted to see him.

126
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,269
Emily: We didn't even have a tripod, did we?

127
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,197
Rym: No, because I was done.

128
00:09:00,217 --> 00:09:01,329
Rym: I'd gotten all my video.

129
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,690
Rym: I was done with my press coverage.

130
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,144
Rym: I had nothing else to do with the con, so we went to see him.

131
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,270
Rym: And then I looked.

132
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:12,350
Rym: I realized there was no press person in the room, so I stood there holding that fucking camera for an hour.

133
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,210
Emily: No, you earned your press credentials on that one.

134
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,650
Rym: And only like 300 people have even watched that interview.

135
00:09:18,581 --> 00:09:19,029
Emily: I don't know.

136
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:25,630
Emily: It's kind of frustrating to me because for me, the art has always been the most important.

137
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:36,030
Emily: I'm an animation fan first, and I like the anime culture a little bit, but it's more about the art form for me.

138
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,150
Emily: It's more about filmmaking and animation.

139
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:46,770
Emily: And so the fact that you'd have the chances to go see these directors that actually made the work, and people just don't seem that interested.

140
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:51,029
Rym: Scott and I went years ago to Anime Central, and Rintaro was there.

141
00:09:52,131 --> 00:09:58,949
Rym: There was like 100 people scattered around in this big room, and most of them were just kind of hanging around in the room playing DS's and waiting for whatever was next.

142
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,170
Emily: It's like people geeking out about these American voice actors.

143
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:13,490
Emily: Who, I mean, to be fair, it's like that's good that they're getting recognition, but I'm sorry, you're gonna skip out on this director to go see somebody who's a dub actor?

144
00:10:15,956 --> 00:10:17,330
Emily: I don't know, that seems a little silly.

145
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:27,270
Rym: But basically, the movie actually got picked up pretty much right away, and disappeared from all the torrent sites, so Scott was unable to pirate the movie and see it in time for us to do a review.

146
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,210
Emily: But that's good, because that means Funimation.

147
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,230
Emily: It's Funimation, right?

148
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,349
Emily: I think is the one who licensed it.

149
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,307
Emily: Oh yeah, I think so.

150
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,309
Emily: Yeah, so it's like they're on it.

151
00:10:36,632 --> 00:10:39,890
Emily: I think it was either them or Bandai, I forget.

152
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:40,828
Emily: I'm pretty sure it was Funimation.

153
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:43,436
Emily: No, I'm talking about that.

154
00:10:43,456 --> 00:10:47,128
Emily: did Girl Who Leapt Through Time, and their previous ones.

155
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:56,030
Rym: Oh yeah, I'm pretty sure they did all of them, but I'm not 100% sure, because I haven't actually paid attention to who picked stuff up in the last four to six years.

156
00:10:56,291 --> 00:11:05,270
Emily: Anyway, I think the releases of his previous movies were fairly popular, so I'm glad to see that they think this one is a pretty sure bet.

157
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:07,630
Rym: I think it is, it was a great movie.

158
00:11:07,931 --> 00:11:09,048
Emily: It was amazing.

159
00:11:09,552 --> 00:11:21,870
Rym: Even if you don't listen to a review and you just don't go any further, guys, there aren't that many anime feature films that aren't just the One Piece Movie 6 of Matsurita, Shakuto, Himitsu no Shima.

160
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:30,170
Emily: Your Watch All anime movies aside, Hosoda is probably my favorite anime director right now.

161
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:46,970
Emily: Like every single one of his recent films, basically the three he co-wrote and directed, the Girl Who Leapt Through Time, Summer Wars, and this movie, they're all, I don't know, they're incredibly emotionally resonant for me.

162
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:56,109
Emily: Like Girl Who Leapt Through Time, I think is the best example in film I've ever seen of a high school experience.

163
00:11:57,412 --> 00:11:58,849
Rym: Not Shoujo Kakamei Utena?

164
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,009
Rym: Because that's exactly what high school was like for me.

165
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:10,270
Emily: I mean like relating to how I felt as a teenager, just the scenes where she has these easy friendships with these two guys and they go play baseball.

166
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,030
Emily: And that was just something that's so, I don't know, relatable and down to earth.

167
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:27,890
Emily: And also like her kind of being dumb about emotional stuff, like, you know, hiding from the guy and being like, but it didn't come across as exaggerated.

168
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:37,590
Emily: It came across as very believable and you're like, man, that feels like, you know, it just portrayed teenager-dom so well.

169
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:48,802
Rym: Well, I think he's also just, he's got enough sort of versatility and he's done a lot of things and he's taken the path that is almost the surefire way to know.

170
00:12:48,863 --> 00:12:50,690
Rym: it's a director that's at least in my wheelhouse.

171
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:58,250
Rym: Because if you look at his credits, he's credited with being a key animator for a ton of relatively big things throughout his career.

172
00:12:58,572 --> 00:13:01,130
Emily: But I guess, I guess girlhood left through time.

173
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,330
Emily: That was like, it made you feel high school.

174
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:17,490
Emily: And Summer Wars, it made you feel like, you know, I have a big extended family and it's like the feeling of, you know, having all these relations and some of them, other ones are pissed off at.

175
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,350
Emily: And like, some of them are old and bossy and some of them are young and loud.

176
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,628
Rym: Well, even just the little bits like cutting like the kitchen and the one girl just watching the TV.

177
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:26,730
Emily: It's just like the little touches.

178
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:42,590
Emily: It came across as very, you know, it wasn't realistic in that like, this is exactly like a filming somebody's family, but it came across as, you know, a genuine feeling, you know?

179
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,470
Emily: And this one, I think this one portrayed motherhood in the same way.

180
00:13:47,631 --> 00:13:49,150
Emily: It's just really captures.

181
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:58,410
Emily: And I think it's awesome because you very rarely see fantasy movies or fairy tales told from the mother's perspective.

182
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,850
Rym: It's even like a look at the question.

183
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,507
Rym: The kid is like, why is it so odd?

184
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,930
Emily: It's such a rare choice for the kid.

185
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:10,650
Rym: It was a movie about, you know, I don't get to see my mom anymore because I go away to boarding school or whatever.

186
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,329
Rym: Like, it's so sad that the brother disappeared off into the mountains and all these bits.

187
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,850
Rym: But really, from the mother's perspective, that was the victory.

188
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:22,850
Emily: That was the success was about raising a child to the point of independence.

189
00:14:23,835 --> 00:14:36,590
Emily: You know, it was really kind of great because it showed this character who was incredibly strong, but, you know, also dealt with her challenges in a realistic manner.

190
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:41,630
Emily: So anyway, we'll talk about, tell people what it's about.

191
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:48,130
Emily: You know, the poster just has this lady and she's got two kids and they have wolf ears and wolf tails.

192
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:54,649
Emily: And you're like, oh, are they like, you know, kind of like cat people, wolf people with just the ears?

193
00:14:55,755 --> 00:14:56,489
Emily: Not really.

194
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:10,149
Emily: What the premise is, is there's this college student named Hannah and she's going to class one day and she sees this mysterious man in the corner who's like auditing the class and taking notes.

195
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:13,070
Emily: And she thinks he's kind of interesting.

196
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:16,810
Emily: So she gets to know him and, you know, they start a relationship.

197
00:15:17,392 --> 00:15:24,510
Emily: And there's something she doesn't know at first is that it's a werewolf love story.

198
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:31,269
Emily: But I mean, this thing is a hell of a lot more, I don't know, more heartfelt than Twilight, I think.

199
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,250
Rym: I don't think we're going to spoil a lot of what happens.

200
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,038
Emily: You should all watch it.

201
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:47,150
Rym: But it's pretty commonly known that basically the story is that he dies pretty much right away and she's got the two kids.

202
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:57,210
Emily: Yeah, it basically that's not really a spoiler because in the trailer, in most reviews, they mention the fact that they lose their father very young.

203
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:07,090
Emily: And oh my gosh, you know, so it's got a similar thing in terms of the montage after they get together.

204
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:12,030
Emily: It's almost a little bit like that scene in Up where it just kind of shows their life together.

205
00:16:12,191 --> 00:16:17,010
Emily: And, you know, music and her getting pregnant and dealing with the pregnancy.

206
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,649
Rym: But be warned, I mean, his death is sudden.

207
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:21,450
Emily: It is horribly sad.

208
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:27,230
Rym: You can hear the entire audience sort of reacting to it at once because you knew it was coming and you expected it.

209
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,310
Rym: And yet at the same time, you kind of didn't.

210
00:16:29,634 --> 00:16:30,990
Emily: It was very short.

211
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,629
Emily: It was like you don't actually see his death.

212
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:40,368
Emily: And, you know, the whole scene where she finds out about it is just very short.

213
00:16:41,031 --> 00:16:42,270
Emily: There's no dialogue.

214
00:16:43,431 --> 00:16:57,250
Emily: It's just shown and it's wrenching because he dies as a wolf and, you know, his body is being picked up and she's unable to claim it, basically.

215
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:09,748
Emily: She's unable to say that's my husband or, you know, that's my, you know, imagine the love of your life dies and you see them in front of your eyes and you can't do anything about it and they're gone.

216
00:17:10,492 --> 00:17:14,530
Rym: And then from that, she basically just moves out to the countryside and then the whole rest of the movie happens.

217
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:17,169
Emily: That's cutting a little bit.

218
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,189
Rym: No, I don't want to go through the whole plot.

219
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,150
Emily: Yeah, obviously.

220
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,621
Emily: But you know how I was talking about.

221
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:34,850
Emily: she has to go through a lot of struggles and it shows the strength of a mother because it's like she's in the city and, you know, there's this very funny scene.

222
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:43,410
Emily: She has the kids at home because she doesn't know if they're going to come out as wolf or as human, so she's like kind of worried.

223
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:52,210
Emily: There's a lot of scenes early on where it's like, for example, the daughter eats one of those packets that come in food, you know, the silica.

224
00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:56,789
Emily: Yeah, and she vomits and she doesn't know.

225
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,329
Rym: Well, she's standing there looking at the pediatrician.

226
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:04,890
Emily: She's looking back and forth between the vet clinic and the pediatrician's office.

227
00:18:05,778 --> 00:18:06,929
Emily: Which one do I go to?

228
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:17,370
Emily: But the kids are really cute because they'll swap back and forth between the forms of wolf and human very quickly.

229
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:24,109
Emily: You know, they'll kind of morph back and forth depending on their emotion and they don't have a lot of control over it when they're small.

230
00:18:24,774 --> 00:18:25,946
Emily: So they'll be like, "I'm

231
00:18:26,007 --> 00:18:26,290
Emily: hungry!"

232
00:18:26,513 --> 00:18:27,366
Emily: And then the mom's like,

233
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:27,609
Emily: "Wait!"

234
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,950
Emily: And they'll turn into a wolf and run around the room and chew on corners.

235
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:43,550
Rym: He definitely just in general seemed to have a lot of fun with using, a lot of times when there's an anime or even a live action movie where there's transformations or something like that, they're often done kind of derpily.

236
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:53,970
Rym: They're done really well in this movie because every transition is kind of well-timed and just looks good and fits the scene and actually is often kind of hilarious.

237
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,510
Emily: Well, the character designs are fairly simple.

238
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:05,270
Emily: And one thing that initially kind of bothered me about the movie is that sometimes when they were in their wolfish forms, they still looked a little too human.

239
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,343
Emily: They had hair.

240
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:15,649
Emily: It looks like, you know those like dog head girl kind of furry art on DeviantArt where it'll be like a dog but it has like anime hair?

241
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:18,647
Emily: That's what it kind of looked like and so I was like,

242
00:19:18,668 --> 00:19:18,708
Emily: "Eh.".

243
00:19:19,051 --> 00:19:26,150
Emily: But then I realized that that was still, they're retaining a little bit of the human form, like the eyes and stuff like that.

244
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,270
Rym: Well, that was just it, that they're kind of at this liminality between humans and wolves.

245
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,410
Emily: Yeah, and so they kind of blend back and forth.

246
00:19:32,531 --> 00:19:34,429
Rym: So not to interrupt, but breaking news.

247
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:38,970
Rym: Lou accepted every freaking panel we submitted.

248
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:40,708
Rym: Are you listening to this?

249
00:19:41,091 --> 00:19:42,390
Emily: Is it going out live?

250
00:19:42,911 --> 00:19:45,670
Rym: All anime are the same show on Friday.

251
00:19:46,192 --> 00:19:48,590
Rym: We are performing anime openers from around the world.

252
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,609
Rym: Our prize, if you've already seen it, don't see it.

253
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:57,510
Rym: We're performing how to recommend anime, how to run an anime club, and judge anime by its cover.

254
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,230
Rym: Seriously, judge it by its cover.

255
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:03,270
Emily: Oh man, they're really, he's really... Oh my god, are they all on Friday?

256
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,349
Rym: I think they're all up.

257
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,270
Rym: No, one's on Saturday.

258
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:11,430
Emily: But that's kind of awesome because we'll get it out of the way and then... Well, let's see if I got accepted later.

259
00:20:11,931 --> 00:20:13,269
Emily: But thank you, Lou.

260
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,489
Emily: Hooray, we're going to anime Boston.

261
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,850
Rym: Now I have to actually write four of those five panels.

262
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,310
Emily: You brought it on yourself, kiddo.

263
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:27,930
Rym: One of them requires a not insubstantial amount of video editing and we have to acquire some movies that are difficult to acquire.

264
00:20:28,772 --> 00:20:31,870
Rym: Thanks, Mike Tool, for forcing us to step up our game.

265
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:33,746
Emily: Yay, you can do it.

266
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:50,190
Rym: So anyway, what I found really interesting, and I think it's actually really important to the whole theme of the movie, but it was interesting that when he reveals that he's a wolf, I like how she's pretty much like, "Okay, this is cool.

267
00:20:50,431 --> 00:20:51,365
Rym: I can deal with

268
00:20:51,386 --> 00:20:51,548
Rym: this.".

269
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,610
Rym: Like the way she reacts, I thought was very well done.

270
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,990
Emily: What did they say in the booklet?

271
00:20:56,171 --> 00:21:01,006
Emily: It was like, "She takes this information in stride and is maybe even a little attracted to the

272
00:21:01,107 --> 00:21:01,349
Emily: idea.".

273
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:03,270
Emily: And that's really how it comes across.

274
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:04,950
Emily: Like, anyway.

275
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:17,230
Rym: Yup, but the fact that he remains a wolf, sort of an anthropomorphic wolf, one could almost say a furry, as their sex scene begins.

276
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:20,190
Emily: I mean, it's a fade to black sort of thing.

277
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,469
Rym: Leaning over as the camera fades out.

278
00:21:23,137 --> 00:21:23,708
Rym: But you know what?

279
00:21:24,112 --> 00:21:32,313
Rym: I think it's actually really important that that was that way, because it shows that she accepted him 100%.

280
00:21:32,313 --> 00:21:40,750
Rym: I've always thought it was a cop-out, whenever there's a movie where there's some sort of alien or other, some non-human thing that is a romantic interest of a human.

281
00:21:41,832 --> 00:21:46,630
Rym: And if they're a shapeshifter or something, it always ends up being that it's just a human.

282
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,725
Rym: They always cop out and go back to, "Oh, it's just a human, maybe with green

283
00:21:49,745 --> 00:21:50,048
Rym: skin.".

284
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:54,470
Rym: I mean, Captain Kirk wasn't really having sex with the alien blob.

285
00:21:55,593 --> 00:21:58,010
Rym: It was always the alien blob turns into a girl.

286
00:21:59,815 --> 00:22:02,610
Rym: But this, it really... He is not human.

287
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:06,070
Rym: And that really drives home that he is not human.

288
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,009
Emily: Well, he's part human.

289
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:07,769
Emily: That's the thing.

290
00:22:08,874 --> 00:22:09,970
Emily: Oh yeah, he's part human.

291
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,010
Rym: But as a result, he is not human.

292
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,250
Rym: He's not wolf either.

293
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,189
Rym: He's something else.

294
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,990
Emily: But really, that's the major theme of the movie.

295
00:22:17,391 --> 00:22:22,650
Emily: The two themes I think that are the most important, are motherhood and identity.

296
00:22:23,892 --> 00:22:43,910
Emily: It's about somebody with a dual identity or a dual heritage, dealing with those heritage and eventually coming to a place where they're able to find balance, becoming their own individual and managing whatever identities make up who they are.

297
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:51,008
Rym: And then that all comes around full circle in the end with the girl wolf and her sort of interactions with the people around her.

298
00:22:52,652 --> 00:22:54,870
Emily: So I like that, yeah.

299
00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:01,629
Emily: But as far as it being a movie to show to kids, I think kids can enjoy it.

300
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:06,670
Emily: I mean, the audience, there were a lot of kids, obviously, because this was Children's Film Festival.

301
00:23:07,272 --> 00:23:10,110
Emily: And I think they noted it as nine and up.

302
00:23:10,551 --> 00:23:12,349
Emily: It was either like seven and up or nine and up.

303
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:15,810
Rym: This movie is best appreciated by someone who has achieved adulthood.

304
00:23:16,273 --> 00:23:19,010
Emily: I think, what did he say?

305
00:23:19,452 --> 00:23:32,243
Emily: The director said, "I kind of want kids to watch it with their parents and then they will appreciate how hard it is to raise children and what their parents go

306
00:23:32,284 --> 00:23:32,486
Emily: through.".

307
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:41,169
Emily: I mean, obviously, their parents aren't going through them like turning into little canine forms and chewing on the walls and stuff like that.

308
00:23:41,992 --> 00:23:47,609
Rym: Though, I've met many kids where, maybe you could do it straight up.

309
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:59,609
Rym: If you replaced the other animal characters with just other people, this could just be a movie almost the same where she's just a single mother raising two kids.

310
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:02,030
Emily: Really, really hyperactive kids.

311
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:05,709
Rym: But at the same time, all that does is show to highlight that it's not easy to raise kids.

312
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:11,950
Rym: The fact that they're wolves and that they're even one step further difficult.

313
00:24:12,071 --> 00:24:19,250
Rym: I mean, really, them being wolves just gives her this sort of confusion and fear that she's going to do something wrong.

314
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:20,570
Rym: She doesn't know how to do it.

315
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,449
Emily: She doesn't know how to raise children.

316
00:24:23,351 --> 00:24:29,648
Rym: Humans don't know how to raise children either and everyone kind of expects that when they're an adult, they'll just know what to do.

317
00:24:30,191 --> 00:24:30,726
Emily: Intuitively, yeah.

318
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:38,489
Rym: So this is a way to express to someone who isn't already a parent and hasn't already gone through this just what that feels like.

319
00:24:39,492 --> 00:24:42,490
Rym: Well, I mean, the only thing... The kid ate a desiccant.

320
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:43,148
Rym: Are they dying?

321
00:24:43,532 --> 00:24:43,948
Rym: I don't know.

322
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:44,806
Rym: What do I do?

323
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:53,129
Emily: Yeah, I mean, the only difference is that she has to... She decides she has to hide this and, you know, it makes sense.

324
00:24:53,511 --> 00:24:55,850
Emily: She can't like tell everyone her children are werewolves.

325
00:24:56,371 --> 00:25:06,630
Emily: There is a really funny scene that I want to talk about, but there's this scene where the... Ah, I won't spoil it, but like when they're changing back and forth and there's guests over, but the guests don't realize.

326
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,590
Rym: That's when Yuki starts getting a little bit precocious.

327
00:25:10,414 --> 00:25:11,350
Emily: She is so cute.

328
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,990
Emily: Like both children are very cute.

329
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:22,350
Emily: Yuki, the older girl, she's very much the tomboy when she's a little kid and Ame is very quiet and sensitive.

330
00:25:22,531 --> 00:25:25,430
Emily: and there's this scene that's kind of sad.

331
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:30,808
Emily: It was very cute, but he's like, "Why are wolves always the bad guys in the picture

332
00:25:30,848 --> 00:25:31,109
Emily: books?".

333
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,370
Emily: And he's crying because the wolves are always evil in the stories.

334
00:25:36,251 --> 00:25:42,230
Rym: There is also a bunch of a set of old man characters that are up Scott's alley.

335
00:25:43,173 --> 00:25:48,588
Emily: So this film, it's one of those stories where it's kind of like... What's that book?

336
00:25:49,771 --> 00:25:58,189
Emily: The Shipping News, where they move to a very rural environment and the story starts off... Stuff kind of sucks.

337
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,449
Emily: Stuff is bad, you know?

338
00:26:01,813 --> 00:26:09,890
Emily: And little by little through hard work and building connections and stuff, stuff never becomes perfect, but it gets better.

339
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,970
Emily: It just goes up and up, you know?

340
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,870
Emily: And so I like that aspect of the movie.

341
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:20,289
Emily: It's like when they're fixing up that old busted house they live in and stuff like that.

342
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,570
Emily: And the people in the village are hilarious.

343
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:25,900
Emily: All the little side character bits about them.

344
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,310
Emily: teaching her how to farm is pretty, pretty awesome.

345
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,210
Rym: Now the movie takes a while to get where it's going.

346
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,310
Rym: I mean, it's a full two hours.

347
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:43,909
Rym: But it really works because as a result it can really focus on the kind of the long relationship building and the long growth of the kids.

348
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:58,450
Rym: You see the kids growing up through several eras of their lives and there's this great sort of montage kind of in the second third of the movie where it just keeps panning up and down a hallway like when the kids are in first and second grade and second and third grade and back and forth.

349
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:59,609
Emily: And it's just so well done.

350
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:05,330
Rym: I really want to see the movie again just to watch that scene again because it's so well put together.

351
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,970
Emily: - Yeah, so I like that scene.

352
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:15,670
Emily: It was interesting because it takes place in a very, very rural area but it's gorgeous.

353
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,650
Emily: The scenery is so beautiful.

354
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:21,149
Rym: - Well, you asked him a question and it was pretty straightforward to answer.

355
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:28,850
Emily: - I said, both in Summer Wars and in this film you chose to set them in the Japanese countryside.

356
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:33,610
Emily: Did you grow up in the country or is there any connection to the country?

357
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:39,550
Emily: And he said, actually the town this is set in is based on where I grew up in the Japanese Alps.

358
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,328
Emily: - And I was like, cool.

359
00:27:42,211 --> 00:27:45,850
Emily: This is kind of his hometown, so to speak.

360
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:48,230
Emily: And so I thought that was pretty neat.

361
00:27:48,351 --> 00:27:52,190
Emily: but yeah, it's a beautiful movie in terms of the artwork and everything.

362
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,690
Rym: - So it's independent of our general.

363
00:27:56,031 --> 00:28:00,249
Rym: if there is an animated feature film, you should see it.

364
00:28:00,992 --> 00:28:05,070
Rym: This one stands up above and beyond even that recommendation.

365
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:09,410
Emily: - Yes, I mean, I have very little bad to say about the film.

366
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,410
Rym: - So I say two things.

367
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,749
Rym: If you're a fan of anime of any stripe, just watch this movie.

368
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,530
Rym: If you're a fan of animation, just watch the movie.

369
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,710
Rym: If you're a fan of Mamoru Hosoda, just watch the movie.

370
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:25,790
Rym: But independent of that, I would suggest tricking your parents into seeing this movie.

371
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:26,667
Emily: - Yeah.

372
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:29,246
Rym: - Don't really tell them what it's about and just get them to watch it.

373
00:28:29,812 --> 00:28:33,090
Rym: 'Cause if nothing else, I think they'll appreciate it.

374
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:39,250
Rym: And especially if you're their child, they will appreciate you offering to them to watch it.

375
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,829
Emily: - I think this is probably the best werewolf movie I've ever seen.

376
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,010
Emily: I love this movie.

377
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,570
Emily: - Best werewolf movie, yeah.

378
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,470
Rym: - No, this is totally hands down.

379
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,129
Rym: - Because an American werewolf in London is actually kind of derpy.

380
00:28:51,652 --> 00:28:55,170
Rym: And an American werewolf in Paris is actually really stupid.

381
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:57,529
Emily: - See, it's not a werewolf genre movie.

382
00:28:57,751 --> 00:29:03,670
Emily: It doesn't have, when you say werewolf movie as a genre, it's not that, but it's about werewolves.

383
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,570
Emily: And so my favorite werewolf movie.

384
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,550
Rym: - I'm trying to expand to any movie that's ever had a werewolf in it.

385
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:12,190
Rym: There aren't that many that are good in any sense other than derpy horror.

386
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,909
Emily: - Anyway, I don't know if there's, I have that much more to say about it.

387
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,410
Emily: I'm relatively positive.

388
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:27,309
Emily: Also, like we said, it was long, but it's like, we talked about Welcome to the Space Show and that one is really long.

389
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:30,067
Emily: But that one could have been cut, exactly.

390
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:35,448
Emily: I felt like that one, they had many scenes where I'm like, you really stretched it out.

391
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:40,610
Rym: - Or meanwhile, Oshie's sad children fly planes endlessly forever.

392
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:41,948
Emily: - But that was on purpose.

393
00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:44,210
Emily: I say that's on purpose.

394
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,510
Rym: - And super slow, but form is function.

395
00:29:48,373 --> 00:29:49,489
Rym: It's that way for a reason.

396
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,789
Rym: - If you didn't like it, you just have no attention span.

397
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:52,910
Rym: But I digress.

398
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,170
Rym: Wolf Children is great.

399
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:57,229
Rym: You should watch it and tell Scott to watch it.

400
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:00,888
Rym: That'll just infuriate him because he currently can't get ahold of it to watch it.

401
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:06,650
Emily: - He never watches, don't tell him to watch it 'cause he never watches stuff if I nag him about it too much.

402
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:09,029
Emily: If I go watch it, watch it, watch it, then he'll be like.

403
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,250
Rym: - In fact, you know what, Scott's a butt.

404
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,070
Rym: 'cause I don't know if he's never gonna listen to this.

405
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:13,509
Rym: He'll never know what we said.

406
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,449
Rym: I know how he is.

407
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,389
Rym: Scott, you're a butt.

408
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:18,249
Rym: And also, according to Emily, your microphone smells like a butt.

409
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:22,170
Emily: - No, it just smells like spit and that's what microphones just smell like.

410
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,449
Emily: - That's what all microphones smell like.

411
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,850
Rym: You should smell the pop filter in front of this thing.

412
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,130
Emily: - I'm always scared of spit.

413
00:30:27,715 --> 00:30:29,489
Emily: I don't like the smell of spit.

414
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,368
Emily: I'm like, "Ew, there's spit on

415
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:32,550
Emily: it.".

416
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,630
Rym: - Well, Scott also likes to rub his face on his microphone.

417
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,009
Emily: - Like a cat?

418
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:44,804
Rym: - Yeah, well, you know, sometimes I end it out, Scott'll just kinda put his chin up to the microphone and just be like, "I gotta move my pop filter,".

419
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:45,988
Rym: but he'll be like.

420
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,749
Emily: - But I can just imagine him.

421
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:56,209
Emily: I imagine Scott being all cat-like and rubbing his head on it like a cat rubs its head on your leg.

422
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,350
Rym: - Well, you're seeing Scott doing the show.

423
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,369
Rym: He's usually sitting with his eyes closed.

424
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,309
Emily: - Quintus is face up.

425
00:31:00,471 --> 00:31:01,150
Emily: It's very cute.

426
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:01,516
Emily: He's like,

427
00:31:01,537 --> 00:31:01,598
Emily: "Mmm.".

428
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:05,729
Rym: - The trouble is he's doing that in the videos we're doing in the antenna right now.

429
00:31:06,411 --> 00:31:10,668
Emily: - Well, he's doing okay with the videos, but it's like, well, the other thing is he's fidgety.

430
00:31:11,072 --> 00:31:17,804
Emily: So it's like in the videos, he'll be like bouncing up and down and you'll be like, "Scott, it looks like you're like having a spasm or

431
00:31:17,845 --> 00:31:18,330
Emily: something.".

432
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:21,450
Rym: - I had to stop at one point because I have an outtake.

433
00:31:21,692 --> 00:31:29,960
Rym: We're doing the antenna show and he just starts like moving his arm around like under the table and it just looked like he was whacking it.

434
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:34,870
Emily: But anyway, it's a pity Scott couldn't see the thing with us.

435
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:51,430
Emily: It's like, seriously, if you're in New York, get hip to the Children's Film Festival because... And the funny thing is, speaking of this movie, like maybe six, seven months ago or something, I tweeted at the New York Film Festival.

436
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:54,530
Emily: I was like, "Oh, oh, New York Children's Film Festival.

437
00:31:54,591 --> 00:31:55,742
Emily: Are you gonna have wolf children?

438
00:31:55,762 --> 00:31:56,166
Emily: Please say

439
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:56,610
Emily: yes.".

440
00:31:56,731 --> 00:31:58,085
Emily: And they were like, "It's a

441
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:58,610
Emily: secret.".

442
00:31:59,652 --> 00:32:01,269
Emily: I was like, "Yes, they totally

443
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:01,370
Emily: are.".

444
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,249
Emily: So that's cool.

445
00:32:04,372 --> 00:32:10,310
Emily: You can subscribe to them on Twitter and every year they always have a spectacular show.

446
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:11,228
Rym: - All right.

447
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,964
Rym: And on that note, I gotta get ready for PAX.

448
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:14,390
Emily: - Go to sleep.

449
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:14,910
Rym: - We'll see.

450
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:18,090
Rym: We might not do shows the week after PAX and then we'll start doing them again.

451
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,150
Rym: We'll play it by ear.

452
00:32:20,056 --> 00:32:20,690
Rym: We've been busy.

453
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:27,150
Rym: You guys simultaneously want us to do more video and want us to be at more conventions and do more GeekNights.

454
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:31,670
Rym: and not all those things are gonna happen at the same time.

455
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:33,469
Emily: - It's hard because you travel more.

456
00:32:35,732 --> 00:32:37,630
Emily: Our schedules have been less reliable.

457
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,201
Rym: - I gotta commit to PAX.

458
00:32:39,342 --> 00:32:40,370
Rym: Awesome, I'm going or not to.

459
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,190
Rym: Scott doubled down.

460
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,969
Rym: He bought a plane ticket and a hotel room.

461
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:43,750
Emily: - I don't know.

462
00:32:45,233 --> 00:32:50,710
Emily: I wanna go, sort of, but at the same time, it's like I'm really on the fence about PAX Australia.

463
00:32:50,851 --> 00:32:51,325
Emily: I love PAX.

464
00:32:52,135 --> 00:32:52,750
Emily: Don't get me wrong.

465
00:32:52,750 --> 00:33:00,370
Emily: I was just talking about how awesome PAX is, but basically for the cost of an Australia trip, I could have two Europe trips.

466
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:05,710
Rym: - Well, even if you don't go to Australia just for this, we can still go to Turkey and Scandinavia.

467
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,169
Emily: - Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

468
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:14,050
Emily: It's like if I don't go to Australia, I might be able to go to Turkey and go to Finland and Sweden.

469
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,059
Emily: So I was like, "Oh my gosh, I don't

470
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:16,159
Emily: know.".

471
00:33:17,274 --> 00:33:18,048
Emily: I'm thinking about it.

472
00:33:19,115 --> 00:33:19,770
Emily: I'm thinking about it.

473
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,349
Rym: - Oh, and I'm just gonna show Emily something right now that proves I'm a dork.

474
00:33:22,838 --> 00:33:23,267
Emily: What is this?

475
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:24,469
Rym: - That's my new credit card.

476
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:37,190
Emily: - You've got Rarity's cutie mark on your... Wow, the funny thing is, looking at Rarity's cutie mark on a Capital One card, it actually looks just like one of those designs that they have on the standard cards.

477
00:33:37,771 --> 00:33:38,968
Emily: Wow, that's pretty cool.

478
00:33:40,433 --> 00:33:42,050
Emily: This isn't the platinum card.

479
00:33:42,251 --> 00:33:43,648
Emily: It's the diamond card.

480
00:33:45,331 --> 00:33:48,590
Rym: - I gotta whip that out in front of some punk bronies at some kind.

481
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,147
Emily: - They're gonna steal it.

482
00:33:50,433 --> 00:33:51,770
Emily: Punch you in the face, steal your credit card.

483
00:33:52,012 --> 00:33:54,110
Emily: Anyway, good night, everybody.

484
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,308
Emily: Thank you for having me on the showroom.

485
00:33:56,872 --> 00:33:58,683
Emily: I don't get to do this enough.

486
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,648
Rym: - Well, we'll do it more often, especially if Scott's busy or lazy.

487
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,190
Emily: - I wanna do the thing.

488
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:09,310
Emily: See, Wim didn't let me do thing of the day and he didn't let me do anecdote.

489
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:13,786
Emily: You know, the whole like, "Yeah, today I was riding my bike to

490
00:34:13,806 --> 00:34:14,047
Emily: work.".

491
00:34:14,391 --> 00:34:16,829
Emily: And then, of course, I wasn't riding my bike to work 'cause it's cold.

492
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:17,688
Emily: - Well, we were busy.

493
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:19,126
Rym: You come home later, we did stuff.

494
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,110
Rym: I mean, we had to clip a bunny's nails.

495
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:27,190
Emily: - I would have done my opening bit on how the rice cooker exploded with cake.

496
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,029
Emily: - It did explode with cake.

497
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,750
Rym: Well, it blurpled and then it exploded.

498
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,850
Emily: - It blurpled most horribly.

499
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:38,810
Rym: - Anyway, in conclusion, Scott, you're a butt.

500
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,850
Emily: - No, Scott is the best.

501
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:41,648
Emily: And also a butt.

502
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:42,789
Emily: - Butt, butt, butt.

503
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:43,447
Emily: Anyway.

504
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:46,710
Emily: - Who else?

505
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,790
Rym: I've realized there's people.

506
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,728
Rym: Dave Riley, if you listen to this, email me, I'm just curious.

507
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:54,270
Rym: Because you seem to know a lot about our show sometimes.

508
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,877
Rym: And I listen to you guys.

509
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:59,109
Rym: actually every time you upload an episode immediately.

510
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,129
Emily: - But then he'll hear my noob show.

511
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:02,910
Rym: - He might.

512
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:03,530
Emily: - Yeah.

513
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:04,770
Rym: - You've been on the show before.

514
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,040
Rym: - This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

515
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:17,120
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

516
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:22,520
Rym: - Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

517
00:35:22,822 --> 00:35:25,500
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

518
00:35:25,761 --> 00:35:30,219
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

519
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,751
Rym: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

520
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:38,060
Rym: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

521
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,180
Rym: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
