00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,040
Rym:

2
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:13,131
Rym: It's Thursday, November 17th, and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:13,652 --> 00:00:16,379
Rym: Tonight, we talk about how not to suck at polish.

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,223
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:19,764 --> 00:00:22,291
Scott: Oh, yeah, it's uh, let's do this.

6
00:00:22,311 --> 00:00:23,936
Scott: It's pretty relevant to my thing of the day.

7
00:00:24,217 --> 00:00:24,718
Scott: Oh, really?

8
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:25,320
Scott: Really.

9
00:00:27,644 --> 00:00:32,618
Scott: So, um... You know, Microsoft has their little advantage thing that makes sure you're not pirating and such.

10
00:00:32,819 --> 00:00:33,120
Rym: Yeah.

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,987
Scott: You know, with their Windows Update and whatnot.

12
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:38,299
Scott: Well, they they changed it, so it works on Firefox now.

13
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:40,805
Rym: You know, that kind of makes sense.

14
00:00:40,865 --> 00:00:43,575
Rym: considering that Firefox has hit, what, the 10% mark?

15
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:44,378
Scott: Something like that.

16
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:52,820
Scott: But, I don't know, it's like... Wouldn't they still want to force people to use the IE, which is what- it's like too little too late.

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,940
Rym: It's like, if you would've done- I think "too little too late" applied five years ago.

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:08,359
Scott: Well, yeah, but it's like, all right, if you would have done this, you know, years ago, then, uh... IE would have been dead by now, but doing it now kind of doesn't really help you, you know?

19
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:08,680
Rym: Yeah.

20
00:01:09,142 --> 00:01:12,760
Scott: Because anyone who's not gonna use IE already isn't using it, and I don't know.

21
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:19,111
Scott: It's not gonna help Microsoft, you know, it's not gonna give anyone a better impression of them, and...

22
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:23,871
Rym: Because I saw that they also made a Windows Media Player type plug-in for Firefox.

23
00:01:24,332 --> 00:01:24,694
Scott: Really?

24
00:01:24,714 --> 00:01:26,480
Scott: I thought that was just something they were going to do.

25
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,348
Rym: They're gonna do it.

26
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:28,340
Rym: I don't know if it's finished yet.

27
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:33,561
Rym: You can get it if you're in that beta program, just like you can see- you can play with Office 12.

28
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:42,800
Scott: I don't even know why- I have- I use Firefox, and I have Windows here, and... Windows Media Player is in it just fine, and I haven't installed anything special.

29
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:43,962
Rym: Huh?

30
00:01:43,982 --> 00:01:48,340
Rym: See, I don't really look at media at work, and work is the only place in the world I use Windows now.

31
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:54,740
Scott: Yeah, I only- I look at media on my work laptop, which is my only Windows computer, and it happens.

32
00:01:56,442 --> 00:01:56,578
Scott: Huh?

33
00:01:57,861 --> 00:02:06,780
Rym: So, uh, EMI claims that Apple is gonna change iTunes to benefit them in the way that they've been screaming about for the last, I don't know, year.

34
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:14,382
Scott: I don't know about this story, because a little while ago, didn't we see the story where Steve Jobs pretty much said, "No, no way I'm gonna do this,".

35
00:02:14,422 --> 00:02:15,787
Scott: and he gave the record companies the finger?

36
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:24,480
Rym: But I also point out that right before the, uh, iPod video was released, he said that they would never make a product like that.

37
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:26,739
Scott: That's true.

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:28,623
Scott: Hmm.

39
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:40,060
Rym: Yeah, but apparently they're gonna- they claim that Apple is going to get rid of their "every song is 99 cents no matter what" policy, and replace it with a "songs that are more popular cost more money" policy.

40
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,600
Scott: Oh, I think they're also going to do a "songs that are less popular cost less money" policy.

41
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,320
Rym: You can't get much cheaper than a dollar, but you can get a lot more expensive than a dollar.

42
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:54,540
Scott: You know, a dollar, when it comes to me, no matter what song it is, that's way too much money.

43
00:02:55,321 --> 00:03:05,930
Scott: You're gonna have to charge me- if you want me to pay for MP3s, you have to- first, you have to make it so much more convenient than any P2P network ever has been.

44
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:13,272
Scott: I need, like, a full correctly indexed music library that includes everything I could ever possibly search for.

45
00:03:13,874 --> 00:03:16,360
Scott: And then it has to cost, like, 10 cents a song.

46
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,973
Rym: See, the thing is, I think that in general, prices are going to go up as a result of this and not down.

47
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:28,268
Scott: And I think that piracy is going to go up, and purchases are going to go down.

48
00:03:28,428 --> 00:03:29,290
Rym: Ah, piracy!

49
00:03:29,311 --> 00:03:33,140
Rym: The cause of, and solution to, every intellectual property problem.

50
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:34,386
Rym: Arrrrrrr.

51
00:03:36,627 --> 00:03:37,671
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

52
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:39,920
Scott: It's, it's just so dumb.

53
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,180
Scott: I think what people are also worried about is that the prices will change, like, on the fly.

54
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:54,820
Scott: Like, if a song that's, like, so low and ancient, you know, but no one cares about it, it costs, like, 10 cents, and then people start buying it, and they just jack out the price.

55
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:55,823
Rym: Huh.

56
00:03:56,225 --> 00:03:58,359
Rym: The thing is, I don't see Apple doing any of those things.

57
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,482
Scott: Why not?

58
00:04:00,684 --> 00:04:01,328
Scott: They're not Google.

59
00:04:01,348 --> 00:04:03,060
Scott: They're not, you know, immune to evil.

60
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:12,460
Rym: Because I think Apple at least understands how fickle people are, and they're only using iTunes because it currently provides the- exactly what they want, or at least enough of what they want to use.

61
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:16,180
Rym: The minute iTunes goes "bleh," I think a lot of people are gonna jump ship.

62
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:22,720
Scott: But here's the thing, is that, you know, iTunes is only what it is, because all these record companies still give their music to it.

63
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:27,440
Scott: And, you know, Apple really doesn't have a lot of say, and they don't make, you know-.

64
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,835
Rym: However, Apple has the power of saying, "Fine, don't play by our rules.

65
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:31,457
Rym: You're not on

66
00:04:31,558 --> 00:04:32,000
Rym: iTunes.".

67
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,888
Scott: No, that's the other way around.

68
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,740
Scott: The music people say, "Fine, don't play by our rules.

69
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,912
Scott: We'll take our stuff out of

70
00:04:38,034 --> 00:04:38,418
Scott: iTunes.".

71
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:38,961
Scott: See?

72
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:46,440
Rym: But it goes both ways, because unless a bunch of labels all say they're gonna pull out, if one label pulls out, they just miss out, and all the other labels profit more.

73
00:04:46,780 --> 00:05:02,015
Scott: No, because people stop using iTunes, because the point of using iTunes is that it has- Not only is it a dollar a song, which is, I guess, good as far as some other people who, you know, buy music online consider it, but it has all these songs.

74
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,160
Scott: It doesn't have enough songs.

75
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,660
Rym: It doesn't have even- it doesn't have anything I want to listen to.

76
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,089
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't have anything I want to listen to either.

77
00:05:07,109 --> 00:05:08,580
Scott: By my standards, it is crap.

78
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:17,220
Scott: But by people who listen to pop music standards, it has, like, ten times as much as any of the other pay music download services, except for maybe all of it.

79
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:24,120
Rym: Yeah, so if it dropped to having nine times as much, and it's still so much cheaper and better- No, it would drop to having, like, one tenth the amount it has.

80
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,540
Rym: Nah, 'cause I don't think- I think EMI, if they pulled out, I don't think anyone would follow with them.

81
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,160
Scott: You know, you realize there's only, like, three record companies, so it's like a third of the music is just gone.

82
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:35,040
Rym: Yeah, I don't think that'll happen.

83
00:05:36,145 --> 00:05:36,393
Scott: I don't know.

84
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,200
Rym: Of course, apparently it looks like Apple is- if this article is to be believed, Apple's going with it and raising their prizes.

85
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:48,760
Scott: Yeah, you know, there was a contradictory article a week ago, so we'll just have to wait and see till that actually happens, and then discuss it again.

86
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,099
Rym: Well, whenever there are contradictory articles, I generally go with the newer one.

87
00:05:53,260 --> 00:06:01,679
Scott: Yeah, that's- it's one way to go, but... I don't know, these articles- this article seems to be a little more hearsay than the previous one.

88
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,140
Scott: 'Cause the previous one was, like, from the Steve Jobs mouth, and this is, like, from a guy who heard a record company guy.

89
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:17,819
Rym: And I trust Steve Jobs' mouth a little more than a record company guy's mouth, and a guy who listens- Actually, you know, this is the head of the EMI group, Alan Levy, who said this.

90
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,590
Scott: So a big Jew, we can trust him.

91
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:20,779
Scott: Alan Levy, yeah.

92
00:06:22,001 --> 00:06:24,080
Rym: And once again, Steve Jobs, what was the quote?

93
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:27,251
Rym: "Why did we ever make a video iPod?

94
00:06:27,431 --> 00:06:28,737
Rym: There's no such thing as headphones for

95
00:06:28,878 --> 00:06:29,219
Rym: video.".

96
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:29,529
Rym: Yeah.

97
00:06:30,768 --> 00:06:31,139
Scott: You know what?

98
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,909
Scott: They didn't really- they didn't make a video iPod.

99
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:34,920
Scott: They made an iPod that happened to have video.

100
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:35,489
Rym: Yeah.

101
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,980
Scott: It's actually kind of different than a special video iPod, you know?

102
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,100
Rym: See, I think the moral is that these people lie, and until they actually have a press conference, we can't know.

103
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:45,883
Scott: Yeah.

104
00:06:46,751 --> 00:06:48,746
Scott: But, you know what, it could be- You know what, you know what it really says?

105
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:51,400
Rym: It was a slow news day today, and this is all I could dredge up.

106
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,140
Scott: You know what it could be is that they say both things, and they want to see what the reaction is, and then they decide what to do.

107
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:04,340
Rym: Yeah, but that doesn't fit Apple, because by the time he said it, it was too late, because they'd already produced the new iPod.

108
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,460
Scott: Hmm.

109
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:19,119
Scott: I don't know, maybe that's why they like to keep the secrets, so that they can- if they keep everything secret, or at least technically secret, then whatever they do, for real, you can't say, "Oh, you didn't do what you said," because they didn't say anything.

110
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:19,680
Scott: It's all secret.

111
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,879
Scott: And then they could just look at what the reactions to all the rumors are, and then decide what to do.

112
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:28,400
Rym: But they had already decided to make that new iPod, and then he said they're not going to make it.

113
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,700
Scott: Had he known that the iPod's really simple-looking, had he known he didn't design it in like five minutes, right after people said they wanted it.

114
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:51,060
Scott: Speaking of Apple, there's a rumor going around that we'll have the iBooks with Intel chips in January, and the additional rumor is that it will be like $200 cheaper than the current iBooks pricing.

115
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,680
Rym: So it's still far more than I'd ever pay for a laptop.

116
00:07:54,140 --> 00:08:00,640
Scott: Yeah, still- well, these aren't the powerbooks, these are the iBooks, the cheaper ones with the plastic, not the powerful titanium ones.

117
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,300
Rym: Even so, I can get like an old Pentium 2 or 3-whatever for a couple hundred bucks.

118
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,740
Scott: You mean one where the battery only lasts five minutes?

119
00:08:09,163 --> 00:08:09,659
Rym: That's fine.

120
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,560
Scott: No, no, it's not really.

121
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,837
Rym: Because the only laptops that I want are the ones that I can't afford, like those lifebooks.

122
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,967
Scott: It's not so expensive.

123
00:08:17,812 --> 00:08:18,960
Scott: It's more expensive than an iBook.

124
00:08:20,145 --> 00:08:20,739
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

125
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,040
Scott: By a lot, like by a thousand dollars almost.

126
00:08:23,485 --> 00:08:24,800
Rym: But I want that, I don't want an iBook.

127
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,110
Scott: Well, hey, you know, small stuff is expensive, especially in the-.

128
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,900
Scott: well, even in Japan it's expensive.

129
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,240
Scott: It's just more expensive here because you have to get it shipped over to the sea.

130
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,159
Rym: If I lived in Japan, I wouldn't need a notebook, I'd just have a cell phone.

131
00:08:37,504 --> 00:08:38,498
Rym: With a basic plan.

132
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,200
Scott: Yeah, I'm actually gonna try to get a cool phone soon, I'm looking into some options.

133
00:08:46,620 --> 00:09:07,380
Scott: But I don't know, it's kind of weird that they put out the iBook with Intel first, because the PowerBook is really what needs the upgrade that people want, and this tells me that they don't have the powerful Intel chips, that they only have weak ones, and that things that are more powerful than the G5 that are x86 are like not ready yet.

134
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:12,559
Rym: They're the ones who wanted to drop PowerPC, which is very powerful, so they're gonna have to deal with that.

135
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,300
Scott: Yeah, I don't know, we'll see what comes of it.

136
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,520
Scott: I don't know how good the iBook's gonna sell.

137
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,340
Scott: People want PowerBooks and they're gonna hold out until they see them.

138
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:27,073
Rym: Yeah, I just think it was funny, because way back when Apple was pulling out and stopping, they said, "We're not using PowerPC anymore,".

139
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:30,531
Rym: and I worked for IBM, and I was like, "Oh, would that be bad?

140
00:09:30,551 --> 00:09:31,938
Rym: What are we gonna

141
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:31,998
Rym: do?".

142
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,100
Rym: And then I found out that everyone in the world buys more PowerPC chips than Apple.

143
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,440
Scott: Yeah, PowerPC chips are a lot of things you don't expect.

144
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,080
Rym: Yeah, like the Xbox, PlayStation 3, and the Revolution all use the same chips.

145
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,276
Scott: GameCube has it.

146
00:09:47,464 --> 00:09:51,119
Scott: A lot of just random devices that you don't even know have it.

147
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,040
Scott: You know, there's a lot of Motorola PPC chips in just random devices that you don't even know.

148
00:09:56,601 --> 00:09:57,980
Rym: Yep, because PowerPC is good.

149
00:09:58,102 --> 00:09:58,920
Rym: It's pretty powerful.

150
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,340
Rym: It uses almost no power compared to an Intel chip.

151
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,680
Scott: The assembly language is much better than the x86 assembly language.

152
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:06,100
Scott: Yeah.

153
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,940
Scott: So it's just a much better CPU architecture.

154
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:16,279
Scott: It's just that the people who produce the chips won't produce them in quantity or style that Apple wants, I guess.

155
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:20,540
Rym: Yeah, I mean, no one really knows exactly why Apple switched.

156
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:38,940
Scott: The rumor I heard was that IBM refused to make one that was less powerful because they produce ones for their big giant supercomputers, and to also produce ones that are low power and slower for cheaper iBooks and things would cost them too much money to diversify the manufacturing.

157
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,900
Rym: Yeah, I can't really say anything about that.

158
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,979
Rym: I mean, they're all made in the factory I work at, and I actually do kind of know the answer, but I really can't talk about it.

159
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,319
Scott: Yeah, that's what I heard.

160
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:52,000
Rym: Yeah, don't take too much stock in that rumor.

161
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,138
Scott: Yeah, oh well.

162
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:04,435
Scott: Anyway, now that it's, you know, MS Apple Day, apparently some of the Microsoft programs coming out in the future are going to be 64-bit only.

163
00:11:06,406 --> 00:11:06,575
Rym: Great!

164
00:11:07,763 --> 00:11:09,476
Rym: I wonder how many people are actually going to buy a 64-bit PC?

165
00:11:11,061 --> 00:11:28,818
Scott: Well, I think basically what's going to happen is that people buying, people who are using, have Windows networks already, and who are already Windows-ed, are going, they buy a new machine now, a new server, a new something, they're going to buy one with a 64-bit chip in it, and they're going to throw down some Windows on it.

166
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:37,295
Scott: And that'll be good for AMD, because they'll probably make a bunch of sales, because I don't think the Intel, no one's in their right mind would buy an Intel 64-bit chip.

167
00:11:39,441 --> 00:11:50,378
Scott: But I also think it's going to screw MS, because people who want to upgrade the software, but then someone tells them, "Oh, you're going to have to replace your whole server with one with the 64-bit chip," are going to say, "Screw

168
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:50,559
Scott: you!"

169
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,900
Scott: And they're not going to get the upgrade.

170
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,840
Scott: And Microsoft makes all their money by selling the next version of something to people to keep them in their cycle upgrades.

171
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:05,460
Rym: Well, there's also the factor that for the first time ever, the new office at least is pretty radically different in terms of GUI.

172
00:12:06,284 --> 00:12:11,880
Scott: Oh, well, they have their ribbon thing, and I think the idea is the ribbon thing is going to be all over Vista.

173
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:19,599
Rym: The thing is, I have a feeling that a lot of people who use Windows are kind of afraid of change like that.

174
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,800
Scott: You know, you think that too, but have you actually seen this ribbon thing?

175
00:12:24,602 --> 00:12:25,339
Rym: Actually, I have.

176
00:12:26,181 --> 00:12:28,319
Scott: It's kind of okay, kind of.

177
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:31,580
Scott: And I think that people could figure it out after like a few minutes.

178
00:12:32,061 --> 00:12:33,359
Rym: Yeah, it's not a matter of figuring it out.

179
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,599
Rym: It's a matter of, I see people being intimidated by it.

180
00:12:38,082 --> 00:12:43,177
Rym: I mean, I see a lot of Windows users who are really intimidated by OS X in general, just looking at it like, "Wow, what do I do?

181
00:12:44,706 --> 00:12:45,200
Rym: It's different.

182
00:12:46,484 --> 00:12:47,780
Scott: Well, you know, they're just dumb.

183
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:53,300
Scott: But I think that this thing, it doesn't actually change the way you use the computer.

184
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,980
Scott: I mean, you still have the menus up there, right?

185
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,459
Scott: And it actually takes away some of the intimidation because you don't have big menus with a million options in them.

186
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:02,639
Rym: Yeah, but instead the menus change depending on what you're doing, too.

187
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:13,340
Scott: Well, it's basically the same as having a menu, except, you know, if you're doing something, the things that you're most likely to, you know, click will appear in the ribbon and the ribbon changes.

188
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,100
Rym: Yeah, but we'll see how well that actually works.

189
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,158
Rym: I mean, I've seen it, but I've never used it.

190
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,299
Rym: And I've noticed that Microsoft programs in the past have been very bad at predicting what I'm actually going to do.

191
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,477
Scott: Yeah, that's the big problem I'm thinking of.

192
00:13:25,537 --> 00:13:34,300
Scott: is that, okay, so let's say the most likely thing I am to do is save, copy, paste, cut, and insert an image, right?

193
00:13:34,602 --> 00:13:35,659
Scott: So those are all in the ribbon.

194
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:39,660
Scott: When I want to do something else, I think it's going to be a huge pain.

195
00:13:40,109 --> 00:13:40,359
Rym: Yeah.

196
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:47,519
Scott: And it's going to frustrate a lot of people because it seems like everyone who uses Office does one weird thing.

197
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:57,319
Scott: Like, they're a mail merge guy, or they're a random Excel script guy, or they have one quirk and everyone has a different quirk.

198
00:13:58,723 --> 00:14:02,639
Scott: And all those quirks are going to suck and everyone's going to have one sucky experience.

199
00:14:04,461 --> 00:14:12,579
Rym: And I'd say, oh, maybe it'll push some people toward OpenOffice, but as much as I love Open Source and OpenOffice, OpenOffice is slow as shit.

200
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,340
Scott: That's why I don't use OpenOffice, I use AbiWord.

201
00:14:14,828 --> 00:14:14,958
Scott: Yeah.

202
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:19,440
Scott: AbiWord is fast, it just doesn't have all the crazy features of OpenOffice.

203
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:22,419
Rym: I use Office 2000 because I acquired a copy.

204
00:14:23,444 --> 00:14:24,660
Scott: I use AbiWord.

205
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,580
Scott: It's real simple.

206
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:30,340
Scott: All it does is type bold, italic underline, formatting of paragraphs.

207
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,460
Rym: The thing is, I don't even really use an Office suite on my home computer because my old crap printer eventually died.

208
00:14:36,602 --> 00:14:37,378
Rym: I never bought a new one.

209
00:14:39,603 --> 00:14:43,394
Rym: Any document editing I do is usually digital text type documents, and I just use VI.

210
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,160
Scott: Yeah, I use VI mostly, but AbiWord isn't even an Office suite.

211
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
Scott: It's just a word processor.

212
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,160
Rym: Yeah, I just have very little need for a word processor at home anymore.

213
00:14:52,023 --> 00:14:59,299
Scott: I sometimes like to use it if I'm writing something, not editing a text file, because it's nice to write paragraphs of text in.

214
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:00,372
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

215
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:08,459
Rym: Thing is, whenever I write something, I'm usually writing it for a website, and I just have extensions in Firefox that let me do all the Office-y type stuff in it.

216
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:14,620
Rym: Like spell check, and add HTML automatically for bolding, and stuff like that.

217
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,859
Scott: That's all good, but you know, I'm on the train.

218
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:18,431
Rym: Oh yeah.

219
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,760
Rym: What, are you writing a novel?

220
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:20,677
Scott: No.

221
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:21,700
Rym: What are you writing?

222
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,199
Scott: Stuff for websites.

223
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,719
Scott: But you can't exactly visit the website to type in the text box.

224
00:15:26,941 --> 00:15:27,639
Rym: You have an error card.

225
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:28,559
Scott: No, I don't.

226
00:15:29,384 --> 00:15:30,120
Rym: Oh, they took it back?

227
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,399
Scott: They took it back a long time ago.

228
00:15:31,748 --> 00:15:31,836
Scott: Oh!

229
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,079
Scott: And then they gave me, they got these free singular ones, but they only lasted a month, and then that was that.

230
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,460
Scott: The singular one is not as good as the Verizon one, and it's 20 bucks more money.

231
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:41,898
Rym: Awesome.

232
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:48,459
Scott: So if you're looking for a PCMCIA card to get you on the internet, get the Verizon Evdo for 60 a month.

233
00:15:50,321 --> 00:15:53,999
Scott: It's, it's the best in the US, even though it's crap compared to the rest of the world.

234
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,460
Scott: Complete crap.

235
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:57,456
Scott: All right.

236
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,717
Scott: Things of the day.

237
00:15:59,364 --> 00:16:00,259
Rym: Things of the day!

238
00:16:01,181 --> 00:16:01,980
Rym: We have no music.

239
00:16:03,224 --> 00:16:03,376
Scott: Yet.

240
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:04,319
Scott: Yeah.

241
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,579
Scott: Because we're still lazy bums.

242
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,360
Rym: So uh, my thing of the day, I have always been kind of interested in lobotomies.

243
00:16:12,082 --> 00:16:13,620
Scott: Why were you interested in lobotomies?

244
00:16:13,901 --> 00:16:14,679
Rym: I'm not sure why.

245
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,180
Rym: It's one of those weird, not lobotomies as in current use or anything like that.

246
00:16:19,763 --> 00:16:20,240
Scott: Do they still use them?

247
00:16:20,921 --> 00:16:22,480
Rym: Uh, yeah, but not in the same way they used to.

248
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,179
Scott: Thinking about getting one?

249
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,268
Rym: Nah.

250
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:35,160
Rym: See, there was a period in the United States where there was a doctor by the name of Freeman going around, and he was lobotomizing people left and right.

251
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,719
Rym: Thousands and thousands of people.

252
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:38,979
Rym: He would do it in like five minutes with an ice pick.

253
00:16:40,683 --> 00:16:42,160
Scott: He just hit people in the head with an ice pick?

254
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,438
Rym: He would just, he would lay it down.

255
00:16:43,762 --> 00:16:45,800
Rym: He'd use electroshock to knock you unconscious.

256
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,760
Rym: And then he'd shove an ice pick over, like, above your eye.

257
00:16:50,201 --> 00:16:53,899
Rym: It's called a suborbital lobotomy or something like that.

258
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,559
Rym: Take an ice pick, he'd shove it over the top of your eye into your brain, and then you swish it around.

259
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:00,398
Rym: That's all he did.

260
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,859
Rym: And he did it to thousands and thousands of people to cure various psychological ailments.

261
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,980
Scott: See, this is why people like Randy are out and about.

262
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,118
Rym: Yeah, this guy did a lot of bad.

263
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,540
Rym: And he did lobotomies on a lot of people.

264
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:14,239
Scott: It's worse than any chiropractor I've ever heard.

265
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:21,010
Rym: Now, one person who he did this to back in the '50s and '60s, it was done to this little kid.

266
00:17:21,961 --> 00:17:26,400
Rym: And the kid, luckily, wasn't turned into a complete vegetable, and he's still alive today.

267
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:33,959
Rym: And he talked to some reporters, and he had a thing written on how he was lobotomized by this crackpot asshole back in the day.

268
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:35,539
Scott: What's he like now?

269
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,039
Rym: He's a pretty cool guy.

270
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,820
Rym: He's campaigning against this sort of quackery.

271
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:42,540
Scott: I don't think this quackery's happening.

272
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,679
Scott: This particular quackery is happening.

273
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,400
Rym: But other instances of this quackery are definitely happening.

274
00:17:47,922 --> 00:17:48,235
Scott: Oh, really?

275
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:48,574
Scott: Where?

276
00:17:49,222 --> 00:17:50,260
Scott: Are people still lobotomying?

277
00:17:51,481 --> 00:18:01,000
Rym: Actually, not specifically lobotomy, but now they've moved to various anti-psychotic drugs or mood-altering drugs that are really just as bad.

278
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,277
Scott: Yeah, I'm not a fan of those.

279
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,440
Scott: Especially the parents giving them to their kids because they don't raise them right, et cetera, et cetera.

280
00:18:07,741 --> 00:18:18,577
Rym: I mean, the worst part is, from what I gather, the reason this kid's mom had him lobotomized was because, according to what physicians said, he was a normal boy, and the mom couldn't take it.

281
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:20,539
Rym: So she got him lobotomized to quiet him.

282
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,199
Scott: Sounds about right.

283
00:18:22,682 --> 00:18:22,770
Scott: Yeah.

284
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,740
Scott: Just back in the day, they didn't have the Ritalin.

285
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,380
Rym: Yeah, so they just stuck an ice pick into your brain and swished it around.

286
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,840
Scott: Ritalin's not that much better.

287
00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:32,499
Scott: It is better, though.

288
00:18:32,864 --> 00:18:33,514
Scott: Because, yeah.

289
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:38,739
Scott: So, my thing of the day, well, first of all, I don't like the MMOs.

290
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:40,819
Scott: You should know I don't like the MMOs.

291
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,179
Rym: He really doesn't like the MMOs.

292
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:53,000
Scott: I mean, I got my fix back in the day, and, you know, I decided that paying to click a button and make a number go up and chat with people with pictures- Oh, you mean Progress Quest?

293
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,100
Scott: Yeah, is not something I wanted to do with my life.

294
00:18:57,143 --> 00:18:58,500
Scott: And I don't like the TV, either.

295
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:02,800
Scott: If you know me, you know that I haven't watched TV, really, in years?

296
00:19:03,484 --> 00:19:03,860
Scott: Six years?

297
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,398
Scott: Seven years?

298
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:06,159
Rym: Since right about when we went to RIT.

299
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,760
Scott: Yeah, since I got to college.

300
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,380
Scott: And I'm out of college now for half a year, almost.

301
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,480
Rym: Yeah, we don't even have cable.

302
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,299
Rym: More than half a year.

303
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,060
Rym: Even though, despite the fact that Comcast thinks we're stealing cable, they keep coming and checking.

304
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,140
Scott: It's not Comcast Cablevision.

305
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,619
Rym: Oh, whatever.

306
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:19,274
Scott: Anyway.

307
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,460
Rym: Cable- C star.

308
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,739
Scott: But today, there was something so cool on television, involving MMOs, that it got onto the internet.

309
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:30,059
Rym: And, um- In fact, we have a clip, don't we?

310
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,340
Scott: We do have a clip, and it is awesome.

311
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:45,519
Rym: So, uh, without further ado- This role-playing game, out in 2004, returns to the world of Azeroth, where heroes like Leroy Jenkins do battle.

312
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,250
Rym: And that would be the world of Warcraft.

313
00:19:52,852 --> 00:19:53,910
Scott: Leroy Jenkins!

314
00:19:55,596 --> 00:19:56,410
Scott: Oh my God.

315
00:19:56,992 --> 00:20:06,409
Rym: So, either the guy who writes the questions for Jeopardy is a mega nerd, or- One of his friends preyed on the fact that he's not a mega nerd?

316
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:07,559
Scott: Yeah.

317
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:13,590
Scott: What really got me, though, is normally you'd expect no one to get the question right, as no one got the question right.

318
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:17,470
Scott: But this is the college edition, so you'd think they'd all get the question right.

319
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,770
Scott: You gotta be a nerd to get on Jeopardy, but apparently not.

320
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:21,650
Scott: You just have to be a loser.

321
00:20:23,294 --> 00:20:24,910
Rym: I mean, I've never played World of Warcraft.

322
00:20:25,452 --> 00:20:26,958
Rym: I've only actually seen it.

323
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:29,809
Rym: once I saw someone's computer that happened to have it on.

324
00:20:30,434 --> 00:20:31,846
Rym: Yet I know who Leroy Jenkins is.

325
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:33,769
Rym: And he's my hero.

326
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,189
Rym: Second only to Omar Jenkins.

327
00:20:37,134 --> 00:20:37,266
Scott: Omar.

328
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:42,090
Scott: So there's a quote from, uh, on Joystiq about this particular incident.

329
00:20:42,452 --> 00:20:42,789
Scott: Oh, really?

330
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:53,188
Scott: Yeah, it's a- and the guy said, uh, "This either says a lot about the spread of tired internet memes into the mainstream, or about the question researchers'

331
00:20:53,328 --> 00:20:53,750
Scott: addictions.".

332
00:20:54,556 --> 00:20:54,868
Scott: Hmm.

333
00:20:55,130 --> 00:21:02,689
Scott: "Either way, it reflects the rise of gaming into popular perception, while maintaining a huge divide between those who are in on the joke and those who

334
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:02,950
Scott: aren't.".

335
00:21:04,191 --> 00:21:13,750
Rym: Yeah, I can definitely see, say, ten years from now when we're all adults, and there'll be no chance for any of our, uh, age peers to know who Leroy Jenkins was.

336
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:23,370
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, this is really good about what's happening in general, is that a lot- there's a lot of geeks, and we're having this sort of meta conversation on the internet.

337
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:33,666
Scott: It's like this whole- imagine if there was a newspaper that was printed that had completely different stories from the real newspaper, and it only went to some people's houses, and they never let anyone else read it.

338
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:39,724
Scott: But you would still talk about it with other people who got the paper at the water cooler, and everyone else would be like, "What's going

339
00:21:39,926 --> 00:21:39,966
Scott: on?".

340
00:21:40,651 --> 00:21:46,029
Scott: Right, it's kind of like when you, um, you know, when people in the room are using Pictochat, and some people aren't.

341
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,710
Rym: You have this side channel of communication that isn't available to everyone.

342
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,767
Scott: Yeah, and some people are laughing about something, and everyone else goes,

343
00:21:52,807 --> 00:21:53,089
Scott: "What?"

344
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:54,249
Scott: What?

345
00:21:54,830 --> 00:22:06,870
Rym: Plus, it's just so nice to see this- like when we went to Otakon, you know, 22,000 geeks running around, and I knew, and then I experimentally verified, that if I yelled Leroy, a lot of people would yell Jenkins.

346
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,090
Scott: In fact, um, just whispering about yelling Leroy, like, "We're gonna do it.

347
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,345
Scott: Someone else will do it before

348
00:22:13,386 --> 00:22:13,467
Scott: you.".

349
00:22:14,173 --> 00:22:17,450
Scott: And then you will invariably respond with the Jenkins.

350
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:18,189
Rym: Oh, really?

351
00:22:18,593 --> 00:22:18,808
Scott: Really.

352
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:23,529
Scott: It, you know, it's like, I don't know.

353
00:22:23,952 --> 00:22:25,250
Scott: It's like, kind of like an invasion.

354
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:35,550
Rym: Yeah, geeks are kind of- we're slowly subverting- we're like taking culture and making our own, like, subculture, but our subculture is infiltrating the main culture.

355
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:40,290
Scott: Yeah, but people still don't understand or recognize that it's there.

356
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:48,249
Scott: It's kind of like, uh, spying, or like- remember in, uh, Hannibal, when he put the secret message in the classified ads to tell him what was going on?

357
00:22:48,751 --> 00:22:54,110
Scott: Normal people see it as a classified ad, but to the other guy, ah, evil Hannibal messages.

358
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:58,910
Rym: But eventually, like, the more they see it, they'll be scared and/or confused by it, possibly.

359
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,629
Scott: Well, they've already begun to persecute the geeks, and- Yeah, Jack Thompson.

360
00:23:02,871 --> 00:23:03,247
Scott: Jack Thompson.

361
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:03,909
Scott: Jack Thompson.

362
00:23:04,657 --> 00:23:04,807
Scott: Yeah.

363
00:23:05,371 --> 00:23:05,521
Rym: Yeah.

364
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:12,049
Rym: Though Germany has its own Jack Thompson now, but he's in a government position, and he wants to ban violent video games.

365
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:15,710
Scott: Well, we have people in our Senate and whatnot that want to get rid of violent video games.

366
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,650
Rym: Yeah, but I don't think they really want to get rid of them.

367
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:23,087
Rym: Hillary Clinton periodically campaigns against them, but I think that's just a political ploy.

368
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,609
Scott: Yeah, I think it's mostly political ploy.

369
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:35,948
Rym: Yeah, this German guy seems kind of nutty, like he really wants to ban him, and his rationale was that it's- basically, it would remove the burden from parents who don't understand these games.

370
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:43,610
Scott: Well, Germany's not big on freedom anyway, I mean- No, no, no, not like- well, kind of like that.

371
00:23:44,072 --> 00:23:46,730
Scott: You're not allowed to be Nazi there.

372
00:23:47,118 --> 00:23:47,349
Rym: Yeah.

373
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:50,249
Rym: Here, you're allowed to be Nazi, you're just dumb.

374
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:54,549
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, I don't like Nazis.

375
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,187
Rym: Illinois Nazis.

376
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:03,150
Scott: But if you want to march down the street with your Nazi business, I don't care, you're not killing anyone, you're not doing anything, you're just walking around yelling.

377
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:03,890
Rym: Yeah, First Amendment.

378
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:08,310
Scott: While you're an idiot, go for it, you know, if that's what you want to say.

379
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:12,518
Rym: If the Blues Brothers happened to drive through their parade, I wouldn't stop them, I just laugh.

380
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,209
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty much what it comes down to.

381
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:27,729
Scott: So, you know, Germany, sure, that was where the Nazis happened, so I can understand the wanting to keep it away, but the limiting freedom is kind of Nazi-ish, you know, it's kind of like this backwards thing.

382
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:35,670
Scott: So this is just, you know, a government that doesn't have freedom will have less qualms about taking away other freedoms.

383
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:42,969
Rym: Yeah, even though that doesn't scare me nearly as much as what's going on in Britain now with the cars.

384
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,570
Scott: What's going on in Britain with cars?

385
00:24:44,711 --> 00:24:50,230
Rym: In Britain, you know, they got the cameras everywhere, they've got cameras almost everywhere in Britain, just watching everyone.

386
00:24:50,832 --> 00:24:51,769
Scott: Yep, and all about it.

387
00:24:51,850 --> 00:25:01,723
Scott: They even have that thing that can, like, see your face and match you up in the computer, and it just matches faces randomly and looks for people who are in criminal databases and wanted...

388
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:04,870
Rym: Well, now they're setting up the system to do the same thing with car license plates.

389
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:11,409
Scott: So they're just cameras looking at license plates all over, and if your license plate is in the database of bad, they come get you?

390
00:25:11,771 --> 00:25:16,390
Rym: Yeah, and also to, uh, in real time enforce speeding without needing cops.

391
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,650
Rym: They'll just, they'll know if you got between two places too quickly.

392
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:25,410
Scott: But then how will they know if that was, uh, like, the computer didn't malfunction or something?

393
00:25:25,973 --> 00:25:27,710
Rym: Ah, ah, well, the computer's perfect.

394
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,770
Scott: Can you at least go to court and say something?

395
00:25:29,992 --> 00:25:30,870
Rym: I assume you can go to court.

396
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:36,669
Rym: The system's not in place yet, so I'm sure we're going to see a lot of, uh, various court battles and fighting over it.

397
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:41,769
Scott: So I don't know how Britain's courts work, but if that was a US court, you'd find one way to get out of it, and then...

398
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,639
Rym: Well, the thing is, I mean, right.

399
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:47,249
Rym: when the cameras first started going in, a lot of Brits protested him furiously.

400
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:53,249
Rym: And they went in anyway, and eventually people got used to him and stopped fighting him, and now a lot of people are glad they're there.

401
00:25:54,491 --> 00:25:57,710
Rym: So they get used to these things real quickly, scarily quickly.

402
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:03,069
Scott: Yeah, the cameras are there, great, but they don't help when, you know, the cops kill some guy in the subway.

403
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,370
Scott: Shouldn't have been killed.

404
00:26:04,892 --> 00:26:07,050
Rym: No, no, he might have been a terrorist, so it's okay.

405
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,949
Scott: Well, where were the cameras then, huh?

406
00:26:09,972 --> 00:26:11,889
Scott: I don't see the film from these things, where is it?

407
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,030
Rym: I wonder if a camera was pointed over there or not.

408
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,129
Scott: There had to be, this camera's everywhere in Britain.

409
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,110
Rym: Yeah.

410
00:26:17,591 --> 00:26:17,870
Scott: Everywhere.

411
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:21,690
Scott: Like, literally, just on every street, in every public place.

412
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,330
Scott: They're just, they're not in your private place, as far as we know.

413
00:26:24,812 --> 00:26:26,490
Scott: But they might be looking at your window.

414
00:26:27,091 --> 00:26:28,290
Rym: Yeah, which is perfectly legal.

415
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:28,698
Rym: Yep.

416
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:34,590
Rym: In fact, here in the United States, I can stand on the sidewalk, and with a telephoto's lens, get whatever I can through the windows.

417
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:35,630
Rym: Perfectly legal.

418
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:36,409
Scott: Perfectly legal.

419
00:26:36,893 --> 00:26:38,989
Rym: In fact, I could even put those pictures on the interwebs.

420
00:26:39,991 --> 00:26:40,290
Scott: Interwebs.

421
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:48,918
Scott: There's, you know, usually, if you're seeing something going on in a house that, you know, is all, eh, that you want to take pictures of, that's like, ooh, someone wants you to see.

422
00:26:49,832 --> 00:26:50,730
Scott: No one's dumb enough.

423
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:58,290
Rym: I gotta say, because in New York City, there seem to be a lot of people who are naked in the window, and they know they're naked, and they know everyone can see them, and they're doing it on purpose.

424
00:26:58,874 --> 00:26:59,430
Scott: A lot of people.

425
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:09,889
Rym: There's no way you could be standing completely naked in front of a large window in a skyscraper, where there's another skyscraper right across the street with people in it, and not know that they can see you, because you can see them.

426
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:10,548
Scott: Yeah.

427
00:27:11,411 --> 00:27:14,565
Scott: There aren't too many people who stand in the window naked that don't want to be seen naked.

428
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:15,350
Scott: Yeah.

429
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:20,630
Rym: Granted, oftentimes, I'll stand in front of a window naked just because I'm not paying attention, and it's early.

430
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:24,610
Scott: This is why bathroom windows are very high up and small.

431
00:27:25,994 --> 00:27:27,269
Rym: Or they're made with that clouded glass.

432
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:30,948
Scott: I don't like the clouded glass, because I can't see out, and it defeats the purpose of the window.

433
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,589
Rym: What do you want to see out when you're in the bathroom?

434
00:27:33,013 --> 00:27:35,070
Rym: The window's there just to let the steam out after you shower.

435
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,286
Scott: I see what the weather's like.

436
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:42,090
Rym: I have many other opportunities to see the weather.

437
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:43,709
Rym: You know, like every other window I pass.

438
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,810
Scott: I mean, while I'm standing out in the bathroom drying, I'm not doing anything else.

439
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:47,550
Scott: I could look at the weather.

440
00:27:48,693 --> 00:27:50,049
Rym: I don't stand in the bathroom and dry.

441
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,329
Rym: I walk right out of the bathroom.

442
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,129
Scott: You get water all over the place.

443
00:27:54,232 --> 00:27:55,490
Rym: There's this thing someone invented.

444
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,670
Rym: It was called a towel.

445
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,270
Scott: Yeah, I dry myself off with a towel.

446
00:27:58,392 --> 00:27:59,530
Scott: Then I leave the bathroom.

447
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:04,010
Rym: So you're worried about occupying yourself for those, like, five seconds.

448
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:06,128
Scott: Hey, and every little bit helps.

449
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:10,049
Rym: That'd be like if I played Mario Kart while I was walking to my car.

450
00:28:13,262 --> 00:28:14,000
Scott: I plead guilty.

451
00:28:17,181 --> 00:28:25,979
Scott: Actually, when I was driving home from the train station today, I was kind of, I had a little Mario Kart on the brain, and I was like, you know, going outside, the inside on the turn, back to the outside.

452
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:28,619
Scott: I was getting ready to wiggle the wheel a bit.

453
00:28:29,401 --> 00:28:36,760
Rym: Yeah, the other day when I was driving to the drugstore or something, there was a corner and I had this urge to jump and then power slide.

454
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,076
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't work.

455
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,899
Rym: No, my car doesn't jump.

456
00:28:40,521 --> 00:28:41,660
Scott: My car doesn't jump either.

457
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:43,259
Scott: My car barely rolls.

458
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:55,339
Rym: Yeah, so it's going to be real hard for us to continue the podcast because my suspended DS is sitting right there and I can see it blinking at me.

459
00:28:55,742 --> 00:28:58,819
Rym: And I know that I'm one click away from racing some crazy Japanese kid.

460
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:08,980
Scott: Uh, yesterday I played, like, a whole bunch of races, and I only lost once against a guy who was as good as me, and I lost basically by a hair on item luck.

461
00:29:10,045 --> 00:29:10,959
Scott: So I'm feeling pretty good.

462
00:29:11,201 --> 00:29:12,119
Scott: Most people just suck.

463
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,980
Scott: Yeah, they don't even seem to drift.

464
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,560
Rym: A lot of people use the bunny hop method where they just hop around every corner.

465
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:26,360
Scott: Uh, there was one guy who wasn't as fast as I was, but he was, he found this shortcut on one track that I couldn't replicate.

466
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,195
Rym: Which track?

467
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:31,080
Scott: The Luigi, the final Yoshi circuit, the last track.

468
00:29:32,181 --> 00:29:44,620
Scott: And he basically, I don't know what he did, but I tried to go to the same place he went and it was a railing that stopped me from going, but he somehow jumped over this piece of the track and I would get way ahead of him by going real fast.

469
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,100
Scott: Then he would jump over and he'd be in front of me and then I have to pass him again.

470
00:29:49,742 --> 00:29:51,918
Scott: I still won, but it was, it was like, whoa.

471
00:29:53,821 --> 00:30:03,300
Rym: Though I did see, and because we were talking the other day about the things people will put in their little emblems in the game, I saw perhaps the most offensive one ever.

472
00:30:04,485 --> 00:30:05,420
Rym: I don't think I need to elaborate.

473
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:11,220
Rym: Let's just say that it was some form of intricately drawn penis with a racial epithet attached.

474
00:30:11,621 --> 00:30:15,060
Scott: I spent the hours where I was not working at work today and I drew a boo.

475
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,013
Rym: Oh, a boo?

476
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:16,493
Scott: A boo.

477
00:30:17,146 --> 00:30:17,397
Rym: A boo.

478
00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:20,859
Scott: It's pretty good.

479
00:30:21,182 --> 00:30:23,240
Scott: It's better than my previous logo, which is lightning.

480
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,479
Rym: Yeah, my current logo is a poorly drawn skull and bones.

481
00:30:27,381 --> 00:30:29,180
Scott: Yeah, you should draw a quality skull and bones.

482
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,900
Rym: Yeah, this weekend I'm probably gonna sit down and make something cool.

483
00:30:32,841 --> 00:30:35,719
Scott: Like those skulls in Mario where you step on them and they fall down.

484
00:30:36,361 --> 00:30:37,300
Scott: I can make better than that.

485
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,720
Scott: They make a little platform that goes in the lava and you stand on it and they carry you along.

486
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,619
Rym: Or I could just, you know, make the most offensive thing I can think of.

487
00:30:46,505 --> 00:30:47,060
Scott: Yeah, could.

488
00:30:48,303 --> 00:30:49,479
Scott: It's not that interesting though.

489
00:30:50,302 --> 00:30:52,120
Rym: I mean, just one final note.

490
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:56,799
Rym: The guy who had the really offensive emblem, his name also was FuckFuck.

491
00:30:57,763 --> 00:30:58,180
Scott: Great name.

492
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,058
Scott: I played the worst one.

493
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,160
Scott: The only one I played against that was offensive was a guy.

494
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,799
Scott: His name was capital T Bagger with two capital G's in the middle of it.

495
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,380
Scott: And his icon, I think.

496
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,620
Scott: Oh, his icon was a green t-shirt with two yellow letters in the middle of it.

497
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,798
Scott: The letter F and the letter U.

498
00:31:14,801 --> 00:31:15,199
Rym: Classic.

499
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,300
Rym: What an upstanding and eloquent young man.

500
00:31:18,682 --> 00:31:19,298
Scott: Yeah, he lost.

501
00:31:19,931 --> 00:31:20,279
Rym: Oh, great.

502
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:20,998
Scott: Real bad.

503
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,517
Scott: I whooped him.

504
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:28,020
Scott: So we're having a hard time, you know, coming up with things to talk about Monday and Thursday.

505
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:33,959
Rym: Because Thursday is only tough because we, uh, don't have any interviews lined up that we can go out and do just yet.

506
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:34,388
Scott: Yeah.

507
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,340
Scott: And it's, uh, it's hard to force ourselves to talk about something.

508
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,240
Scott: We used to just kind of let it go and trying to force it is not so difficult.

509
00:31:43,421 --> 00:31:52,280
Scott: So at the spur of the moment, I came up with a bit and we decided to call this bit, at least temporarily, how not to suck with Brim and Scott.

510
00:31:53,501 --> 00:32:04,680
Scott: And what I think we're going to the way the bits going to work is each episode of the bit, if we ever do another episode of the bit is we just start saying how not to suck at something.

511
00:32:05,482 --> 00:32:11,579
Scott: And whatever the something is, we just keep coming up with advice, one sentence or a few sentences of advice and how not to suck.

512
00:32:12,241 --> 00:32:19,320
Rym: And then we elaborate until we done describing and will very specifically only pick things that we don't suck at that way.

513
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,838
Rym: We have some sort of knowledge, but we don't suck at anything.

514
00:32:22,704 --> 00:32:23,760
Rym: Uh, we suck at sucking.

515
00:32:26,025 --> 00:32:26,579
Scott: Okay, maybe.

516
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,900
Scott: But well, we can do is, you know, while we're all the bit is called how not to suck.

517
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:32,040
Scott: We can only talk about things.

518
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,440
Scott: We're awesome at many, many things, but not all things.

519
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:38,919
Scott: I'm not an awesome cross country skier.

520
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,118
Rym: No, you're not.

521
00:32:40,662 --> 00:32:42,640
Scott: In fact, I don't even know how to cross country ski.

522
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:50,020
Scott: As you put on skis and you walk around, it's actually kind of fun, but it's very, uh, I think it's mostly sliding, right?

523
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,549
Rym: See, this shows how much I don't know about.

524
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,395
Rym: it's mostly it.

525
00:32:53,361 --> 00:32:56,440
Rym: It's hard, like rollerblading is hard and that you do have to do a lot of work.

526
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,959
Rym: It's mostly not downhill.

527
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,920
Scott: Uh, anyway, the first one we're going to do is the easiest one.

528
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,520
Scott: How not to suck at college.

529
00:33:06,161 --> 00:33:09,899
Scott: The first rule of not sucking at college is the two thirds rule.

530
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:14,939
Scott: Then part one, the two thirds rule is there are three things in college life.

531
00:33:15,421 --> 00:33:19,760
Scott: You're sleeping, you're having fun, and your grades in your classes.

532
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,680
Scott: If you pick any two of those, you will succeed.

533
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,660
Scott: You cannot have all three unless they're all pretty weak.

534
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:34,580
Scott: You pretty much get, you know, you can have, you know, you can have sleep, sleep all you want, never be tired.

535
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:41,220
Scott: You can have tons of fun and you won't pass your classes or any other combination.

536
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:44,199
Rym: We pretty much gave up sleep.

537
00:33:44,702 --> 00:33:49,919
Scott: Yeah, getting, giving up sleep is what I would recommend because that way you pretty much we picked fun no matter what.

538
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,251
Rym: And then we'd give up sleep to get good grades.

539
00:33:53,673 --> 00:34:00,718
Rym: every now and then when we needed sleep, we temporarily give up grades to get sleep because fun is pretty much our number one priority all the time.

540
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,200
Scott: We always maximize the fun.

541
00:34:02,461 --> 00:34:05,900
Scott: And then, you know, I had a little bit of sleep, but that took out a little bit of grades.

542
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,560
Scott: That's why I didn't get a 4.0.

543
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,619
Rym: Like I remember the time when we just said fuck all and drove to Michigan to go to this Linux convention, penguicon.

544
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,739
Scott: Well, I was working at the time.

545
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,338
Rym: I was in school.

546
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:23,520
Rym: Yeah, I was in school and I had a project due that Monday that pretty much if I passed it, I would graduate.

547
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:25,820
Rym: And if I didn't pass it, I wouldn't graduate.

548
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:32,719
Rym: So what I do, I went to penguicon and then I got back Sunday night and I stayed up all night and worked furiously and finished the project.

549
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,360
Rym: And then I slept through like my next week worth of classes.

550
00:34:37,424 --> 00:34:37,739
Scott: Awesome.

551
00:34:38,505 --> 00:34:38,737
Rym: Yeah.

552
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:44,658
Scott: Yeah, and I can't even talk about how many times where I had fun all night, didn't sleep and then went to class the next day.

553
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:48,759
Scott: I mean, if that's not fun and grades with no sleep, I don't know what is.

554
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,719
Rym: Now, the other rule along these lines is very simple.

555
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,159
Rym: It is how to pass a class.

556
00:34:54,739 --> 00:35:01,619
Rym: You are guaranteed to pass the class with at least a low B, if not higher, if you do two of the three following things.

557
00:35:02,682 --> 00:35:03,820
Rym: Actually attend the class.

558
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:05,200
Scott: And pay attention.

559
00:35:05,321 --> 00:35:07,120
Scott: If you attend the class and sleep, it doesn't count.

560
00:35:07,321 --> 00:35:13,800
Rym: Yeah, but if you attend the class and just kind of hang out in the back and don't really pay attention, but you don't sleep straight up, you're fine.

561
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,300
Scott: Yeah, it helps a little bit, but actually paying attention is the best.

562
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:19,938
Rym: Do your homework.

563
00:35:21,063 --> 00:35:21,579
Scott: Very important.

564
00:35:22,302 --> 00:35:23,019
Rym: Or study.

565
00:35:24,924 --> 00:35:26,019
Rym: Now, we never studied.

566
00:35:27,671 --> 00:35:27,860
Rym: Ever.

567
00:35:28,281 --> 00:35:29,140
Scott: I never studied ever.

568
00:35:29,741 --> 00:35:34,719
Scott: Yeah, you know, when I was in elementary school and they said, oh, study for the test, I didn't know what that meant.

569
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:43,219
Scott: I mean, I knew it meant you do something to prepare to get a better grade on the test, but I didn't know specifically what you did.

570
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:45,379
Scott: I was like, what could I do?

571
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:47,460
Scott: I already get a hundred without doing anything.

572
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,200
Scott: Yeah, it's like I didn't understand it and I never took notes.

573
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,040
Scott: And up until the end of college, I never studied and never took notes.

574
00:35:56,425 --> 00:35:57,479
Scott: And I now have a degree.

575
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:04,260
Rym: But you can use this rule to your advantage to modify or take advantage of how much time you get living.

576
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:10,084
Rym: Like, I had a class once where it was Visual Basic and I realized I didn't need to go to it.

577
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:16,280
Rym: So I decided to never go to the class and I just learned Visual Basic on my own by studying and doing homework.

578
00:36:17,261 --> 00:36:19,279
Rym: And as a result, I passed the class.

579
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:26,460
Scott: One important thing to also note about this rule is if there is homework that is graded like a project, that's pretty much mandatory.

580
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:27,160
Rym: Yeah.

581
00:36:27,661 --> 00:36:29,800
Scott: That's considered, you know, it's a test.

582
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,759
Scott: You have to take it.

583
00:36:30,883 --> 00:36:31,420
Scott: It's a project.

584
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:32,400
Scott: You have to do it.

585
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:33,838
Rym: See, we were lucky at RIT.

586
00:36:34,021 --> 00:36:35,980
Rym: Very few people ever assigned homework.

587
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:41,840
Rym: It was always either one big paper or there was like daily homework that was worth maybe five or six percent of your grade.

588
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,939
Scott: Yeah, if something is graded, I always did it.

589
00:36:44,262 --> 00:36:46,040
Scott: But I never did homework that wasn't graded.

590
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,458
Scott: And I never did, I hardly ever did reading homework unless it was for literature class and I hadn't read the book.

591
00:36:52,201 --> 00:36:53,300
Rym: See, I went one step further.

592
00:36:53,862 --> 00:36:57,880
Rym: I would only do homework if I could, because remember, RIT did not have pluses and minuses.

593
00:36:58,041 --> 00:36:59,420
Rym: It was A, B, C, D fail.

594
00:37:00,341 --> 00:37:08,580
Rym: So most people at RIT shoot for the low B, because the low B is still a B and it's the minimum effort required to get a decent grade.

595
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,179
Scott: Some teachers put the B at 83, but what are you going to do?

596
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:11,898
Rym: Yeah.

597
00:37:13,962 --> 00:37:15,580
Scott: But, uh, crap.

598
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:34,720
Rym: Like, I'd look at the syllabus whenever a class started and I'd see like, oh, the final is worth 60 percent and the midterm is worth 20 percent and the project's worth X. Oh, the labs are only worth eight percent of my final grade?

599
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:43,057
Rym: So if I don't do any of the labs, I can still get an A. If I don't do any of the labs and I do okay on the test, I'm guaranteed a B. Fuck the labs.

600
00:37:43,681 --> 00:37:47,658
Scott: It's funny how that often works out where the labs will be the most time consuming thing there is.

601
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:48,940
Rym: And yet they're worth nothing.

602
00:37:49,265 --> 00:37:49,518
Scott: Yeah.

603
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:56,078
Rym: Except in some IT classes where they're worth nothing, except they're a Boolean modifier to your final grade.

604
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,498
Scott: Yeah, if you don't pass them, you fail.

605
00:37:59,384 --> 00:38:02,220
Rym: They multiply your final grade by the integer result of the Boolean.

606
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,140
Rym: If you fail the labs, they multiply your grade by zero.

607
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:06,472
Scott: Great.

608
00:38:09,641 --> 00:38:13,559
Rym: That was the one time I ever failed a class because I didn't do the lab.

609
00:38:14,442 --> 00:38:15,680
Rym: But it was a very conscious decision.

610
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,520
Rym: It was well after the add drop date.

611
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,860
Rym: It was well after the withdraw date.

612
00:38:19,262 --> 00:38:20,618
Rym: And there were still three weeks left of class.

613
00:38:21,523 --> 00:38:23,220
Rym: And I had kind of been slacking off all quarter.

614
00:38:23,921 --> 00:38:26,279
Rym: And I realized that I have a choice now.

615
00:38:26,701 --> 00:38:31,719
Rym: I can lose the next three weeks of my life and not have any fun, but pass this class.

616
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,280
Rym: And get a pretty good grade.

617
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:40,780
Rym: Or I can just say screw it right now, have fun for the next three weeks, and then retake the class the next quarter.

618
00:38:42,126 --> 00:38:42,780
Rym: I didn't.

619
00:38:43,101 --> 00:38:43,840
Rym: I just stopped going.

620
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,640
Rym: It was fantastic.

621
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:49,320
Scott: The one class I remember at RIT is the class I skipped more than any other class ever.

622
00:38:50,442 --> 00:38:51,189
Scott: So much to the point.

623
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,239
Scott: I don't remember the class.

624
00:38:52,881 --> 00:38:53,498
Rym: What class was it?

625
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,720
Scott: It was software engineering.

626
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,300
Scott: Software engineering had a big lab component that went for the whole quarter.

627
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:05,020
Scott: And it had a lecture component that lasted for two thirds of the quarter.

628
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,700
Scott: Or a little over half the quarter.

629
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,600
Scott: I think six or seven weeks, right?

630
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:13,279
Scott: And basically at the end of the lecture part of the quarter, you took a final and that was the end of the lecture.

631
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,000
Scott: And you just kept going to the lab, right?

632
00:39:15,802 --> 00:39:17,599
Scott: The lab counted for most of the grade.

633
00:39:18,302 --> 00:39:21,220
Scott: And that one test counted for a lot of the rest of your grade, right?

634
00:39:22,001 --> 00:39:26,660
Scott: I went to like the first lecture and the second lecture and maybe like one random lecture.

635
00:39:27,463 --> 00:39:29,480
Scott: Other than that, I skipped it all the time.

636
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,259
Scott: I like I feel I kind of feel bad about it.

637
00:39:32,964 --> 00:39:33,979
Scott: Like I never went.

638
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,159
Scott: There was just no attendance.

639
00:39:35,682 --> 00:39:37,920
Scott: And it didn't have homework, you know?

640
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:40,900
Scott: And I studied a little bit for that test and I did okay on it.

641
00:39:41,063 --> 00:39:41,658
Scott: And that was that.

642
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:45,931
Rym: Yeah, so I guess the moral here is just that.

643
00:39:46,332 --> 00:39:56,600
Rym: don't you don't have to always shoot for the perfect A, because if you do, you won't enjoy yourself in college and it's possible to get good grades without doing all the work they give you.

644
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,679
Rym: Be smart about it.

645
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,220
Rym: Min-max.

646
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:02,484
Rym: If something's not worth a large portion of your grade and it's too much work, don't do it.

647
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:03,128
Scott: Yep.

648
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,340
Rym: You're better off spending that time working on other classes that matter more.

649
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,140
Scott: You also have to look at your the your overall grade in the grand scheme.

650
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:21,516
Scott: I mean, if you get a how much extra work will it take you to move from the easy B to the difficult A in like a calculus class and what effect will that have on the rest of your life?

651
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:26,199
Rym: Especially if it would take you half as much work to get an A in another class that you're more interested in.

652
00:40:26,761 --> 00:40:31,460
Scott: If you're trying to be a mathematics PhD, maybe the A is really important.

653
00:40:32,061 --> 00:40:36,806
Scott: If you're trying to get a bachelor's degree in computer science, maybe the A isn't that important and you should.

654
00:40:36,826 --> 00:40:36,987
Scott: just.

655
00:40:37,228 --> 00:40:40,476
Scott: there's not even a point in doing the work because you don't get anything out of it.

656
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,016
Scott: Yeah.

657
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,959
Scott: And if you really want to know calculus, you can learn it.

658
00:40:44,523 --> 00:40:48,397
Scott: You can learn all that stuff without going through the extra effort of trying to get an A in the class.

659
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,740
Rym: Yeah, the grade does not often reflect how much you learn about the subject.

660
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:57,960
Scott: Yeah, I can speak from that very, very openly.

661
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,819
Scott: There are many times where I could take a class and do everything that was going on in that class.

662
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:10,120
Scott: But because of the format of the class or the type of test that we're given or the way the grading was done, I got a very bad grade.

663
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,359
Scott: There are also classes where I didn't learn anything and I got an A.

664
00:41:14,083 --> 00:41:17,620
Rym: Yeah, like all the all the late IT classes are kind of dumb.

665
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,860
Rym: They were all about like tech track.

666
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,375
Rym: They were called cool things, but they were actually just like crap.

667
00:41:23,395 --> 00:41:24,520
Rym: team building exercises.

668
00:41:25,505 --> 00:41:26,480
Scott: Oh, team building.

669
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,025
Scott: Yeah.

670
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,199
Scott: Yeah, that'll always mess up your grade working on a team.

671
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:37,340
Rym: Because the thing is, your teammates will usually be pretty dumb, even though every individual person you know in that class is smart.

672
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,580
Rym: They'll be this kid that you've never seen in class before.

673
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:46,138
Rym: He'll show up one day and you'll find out that you're on a team with him and like two other mystery people.

674
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:53,380
Scott: I was on an awesome team once in ad hoc networking, and that was like my last quarter at RIT.

675
00:41:54,242 --> 00:41:55,640
Scott: I was on the awesomest team of awesome.

676
00:41:56,941 --> 00:41:58,439
Scott: But before that, every team was crap.

677
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:08,579
Rym: So I guess my advice here is if you're ever on a team with people in a class and you didn't get to pick and the people in the team are dumb, if anyone isn't pulling their weight, just first warn them.

678
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,980
Rym: That way you won't get in trouble with the professor.

679
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:12,159
Rym: And then just ignore them.

680
00:42:12,462 --> 00:42:13,960
Rym: If they're not going to do the work, don't bother them.

681
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,140
Rym: Just do the work yourself and then tell the professor, "Yo, this guy's a dick and he didn't

682
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:17,347
Rym: help.".

683
00:42:18,062 --> 00:42:20,700
Rym: And he'll get graded accordingly and you'll get graded accordingly.

684
00:42:22,061 --> 00:42:24,939
Rym: Don't let people grab your coattails and follow you in.

685
00:42:25,301 --> 00:42:25,879
Rym: Make them fail.

686
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:31,929
Scott: The other thing is when it's time to pick teams, even if you don't know one in the class, don't be all,

687
00:42:32,294 --> 00:42:32,415
Scott: "Eh.".

688
00:42:32,961 --> 00:42:38,280
Scott: You know who the smart people in the class are just looking around the room and you know who you can communicate with and work well with.

689
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,300
Rym: If you hesitate at all, you'll be stuck with everyone else who hesitated.

690
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:41,751
Scott: Yeah.

691
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,120
Scott: Go and pick the good people right away.

692
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:55,699
Scott: And if there's a good person who's kind of "Eh," like they're smart and they can do it, but they're not, you have to take... Don't expect someone else to be the leader and you can just get some work assigned to you and do it.

693
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,159
Scott: You have to be the leader guy every time.

694
00:42:57,981 --> 00:43:00,078
Scott: If you don't, you're going to basically...

695
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,300
Rym: If you're not the leader guy every time.

696
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,220
Scott: You're just rolling dice for your grade, basically.

697
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,959
Scott: You got to take it into your own hands.

698
00:43:06,821 --> 00:43:15,960
Rym: Also, one trend I noticed in all the group presentations I did throughout all of college, being funny matters a lot more than your actual content.

699
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:28,880
Rym: And if you do something that's at all creative and you do it confidently and you do it humorously in front of the class, you'll get a good grade, even if the content itself is actually kind of ill-researched and/or crappy.

700
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:31,160
Scott: Yeah, I did that a lot.

701
00:43:31,661 --> 00:43:35,896
Scott: I didn't do too many presentations, but I would always do a funny thing if I was ever in front of the class.

702
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,939
Scott: So just like in that ad hoc networking class I just mentioned, we had to give presentations every week, right?

703
00:43:42,601 --> 00:43:54,179
Scott: And a lot of people had projects that were a lot more complicated than ours was or a lot more sciency or a lot more mathy, and they did a lot more work and talked a lot more about fancy things.

704
00:43:54,681 --> 00:43:57,398
Scott: We made a game that was ad hoc networked.

705
00:43:58,021 --> 00:44:09,460
Scott: It was just a lot like Atari Combat, and we just showed live demos of people with tanks driving around shooting each other, and that got a lot better grade than a lot of the other people.

706
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:26,200
Rym: Because honestly, when they make you do a group project, and it's in most schools, even tech schools, even in extremely advanced, high-level, graduating tech classes, they're not really grading you on your ability to do the tech because you got that far.

707
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,000
Rym: They know you can do the tech, or they know you BS'd your way through it, they don't care.

708
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,600
Rym: They're grading you on how well you can communicate.

709
00:44:33,741 --> 00:44:36,038
Rym: They won't say that, but that's all they really care about.

710
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:45,260
Scott: Well, it's also that when someone's watching you do a presentation, they really can't keep track of the information you're presenting.

711
00:44:45,341 --> 00:44:47,360
Scott: That's why they have you do a paper that goes with it.

712
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,119
Rym: Yeah, well, they're also usually really bored.

713
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,879
Rym: I mean, no one in class is actually listening to you.

714
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:58,798
Rym: They're either thinking about their own project, or they're imagining sexual things, or they're just asleep with their eyes open.

715
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:04,000
Scott: Yeah, I tried to pay attention to pretty much every lecture and presentation.

716
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,960
Rym: I gave up right away, I realized I just couldn't.

717
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:10,119
Scott: But I ended up only remembering and paying attention to the good ones, and the other ones, just whatever.

718
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:10,453
Scott: Yeah.

719
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:18,439
Rym: I actually hated watching the bad ones, because I'd cringe, it just felt so bad to watch someone floundering in front of a crowd of people.

720
00:45:19,022 --> 00:45:21,960
Scott: I also had the cringe effect going on real heavy.

721
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:30,520
Rym: Or sometimes I had the asshole effect, where they'd always take questions at the end, and I'd pressure them about a point they weren't very clear on, and they obviously hadn't researched.

722
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,720
Scott: I would pressure them, but only if they said something that was just flat out wrong.

723
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,800
Scott: I wouldn't pressure them for being weak, just kind of going eh.

724
00:45:39,684 --> 00:45:41,920
Scott: I would hit them, though, if they said something that was wrong.

725
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,312
Scott: They did something wrong.

726
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,319
Scott: I'd be like, what you said was wrong.

727
00:45:46,622 --> 00:45:47,339
Scott: Here's my evidence.

728
00:45:48,026 --> 00:45:48,719
Scott: What do you say?

729
00:45:49,261 --> 00:45:51,319
Scott: We just copied this awful website.

730
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,999
Scott: We didn't actually really research.

731
00:45:54,263 --> 00:45:54,597
Scott: Oh, no.

732
00:45:55,664 --> 00:45:56,680
Rym: Yeah, we got one kid.

733
00:45:57,181 --> 00:46:05,360
Rym: I mean, WEP is cracked now, but when I took this class, it was a networking class, an advanced wireless one, and WEP at that time was not cracked.

734
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:10,192
Rym: No one can say it was cracked back then, because there was really no way to crack WEP back then.

735
00:46:11,062 --> 00:46:12,080
Scott: Brute force always worked.

736
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,339
Rym: Yeah, brute force did, but even then, it took hours and hours and hours.

737
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,478
Scott: Back in those days, yeah.

738
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,058
Rym: Yeah, this was years ago.

739
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:24,620
Rym: And this kid was doing a presentation on wireless security, and he was talking about how, yeah, WEP is totally insecure, and there are cracks out there.

740
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,300
Rym: You can just crack it in, like, five minutes.

741
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:32,652
Rym: And luckily, I didn't even have to raise my hand, because the entire class, including the professor right away, was like, uh, no?

742
00:46:35,604 --> 00:46:36,719
Rym: You got any evidence of that?

743
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:37,415
Rym: I'd like to see it.

744
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:38,452
Rym: Probably win some award.

745
00:46:39,985 --> 00:46:40,940
Scott: Oh, I wouldn't have won an award.

746
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:45,360
Scott: I mean, he was right, you know, but I don't know where he got it from five years ago.

747
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:49,500
Rym: Maybe it was, like-- I think he made it up, because I know that I made a lot of things up in presentations.

748
00:46:49,982 --> 00:46:51,140
Scott: No, I never made any things up.

749
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:57,058
Rym: Not in tech presentations, like, not IT classes, but in my public speaking classes and my speech giving classes.

750
00:46:57,301 --> 00:46:59,280
Scott: Oh, yeah, because then it's not about the information.

751
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:05,960
Rym: Yeah, well, plus then, the people in those classes tended to be, like, freshmen in other softer majors who didn't know or care.

752
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,060
Scott: Yeah, I never made anything up in a class.

753
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:12,739
Rym: I made stuff up on the AP test, too, because I knew they couldn't read them.

754
00:47:13,802 --> 00:47:17,399
Rym: They only got 30 seconds to read your responses, so I made up books, and then I cited them.

755
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:18,656
Scott: Way to go.

756
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:22,680
Rym: And on the advice of my teacher, actually.

757
00:47:23,642 --> 00:47:25,200
Scott: Oh, pretty cool teacher.

758
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:29,035
Rym: Yeah, our school has been accused more than once of cheating at the AP test, but they can't prove it.

759
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,499
Scott: Maybe because they only spent 30 seconds reading it.

760
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,620
Scott: And they looked at it for a minute.

761
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:34,431
Scott: They'd be like, "Oh, they did

762
00:47:34,452 --> 00:47:34,635
Scott: cheat.".

763
00:47:35,082 --> 00:47:36,759
Rym: No, no, because what are they going to do?

764
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:41,320
Rym: Go look up Theodore Stromwell's book, A History of British Politics?

765
00:47:41,761 --> 00:47:46,080
Scott: Yeah, and they'll find out it doesn't exist, and then they'll call you a cheater.

766
00:47:46,942 --> 00:47:48,619
Rym: No, no, because they have to prove it doesn't exist.

767
00:47:49,182 --> 00:47:53,838
Rym: I'm sure in the time it would take them to find out that it didn't exist, I could whip up a copy of that book.

768
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:55,840
Scott: What if the book doesn't exist?

769
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:59,840
Rym: Actually, we did that in, god, this is back in high school.

770
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,760
Rym: I think it was 11th grade.

771
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:04,239
Rym: It wasn't me, but it was a friend of mine, and I helped him do it.

772
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:09,480
Rym: He had to do a presentation on this obscure author, and there wasn't much information on the author online.

773
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,340
Rym: There wasn't much information on many things online back then, compared to today.

774
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:18,480
Rym: And the library at school had crap, so the guy just made it all up.

775
00:48:18,661 --> 00:48:19,699
Rym: And he cited some website.

776
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:27,209
Rym: And then at the end of class, the teacher calls him over and asks him, "Hey, I tried to go to that website you linked to, and the link's

777
00:48:27,229 --> 00:48:27,430
Rym: dead.".

778
00:48:28,641 --> 00:48:30,839
Rym: So he said, "Oh, I must have given you the wrong link.

779
00:48:31,401 --> 00:48:33,375
Rym: Let me go home, and I'll email you the right

780
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:33,617
Rym: link.".

781
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:40,680
Rym: And he went home, and he grabbed me, and I made him a page with all the fake info on it, and I put it up on GeoCities, and then he gave the teacher the link.

782
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,559
Scott: That's pretty awesome.

783
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:46,754
Rym: This was back before teachers really knew what that internet thing was, or how to use it.

784
00:48:47,563 --> 00:48:49,400
Scott: If you did that today, you would be so screwed.

785
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:50,677
Rym: Yeah, but back then?

786
00:48:52,944 --> 00:48:55,420
Scott: All right, so other ways not to suck at college.

787
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,279
Rym: Go outside, have friends.

788
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,899
Scott: Going outside to having friends is very key.

789
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,860
Scott: If you just think that friends are going to come along, that's not going to work.

790
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,760
Scott: You need to go and find like-minded people and talk to them.

791
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:06,135
Scott: Yes.

792
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:13,660
Scott: And don't try to do it with a frat or some other kind of "pay to have friends" group.

793
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:18,699
Scott: You have to find some genuine friends, or else, you know, after college you're just never going to see these people again.

794
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:19,190
Rym: Yeah.

795
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:20,600
Scott: They won't be real friends.

796
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:23,760
Scott: They're just like, it's like prostitute friends almost.

797
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,280
Rym: And there's nothing wrong with drinking in college, but don't be that guy.

798
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:31,419
Rym: You know him.

799
00:49:31,661 --> 00:49:32,440
Rym: He's half naked.

800
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:37,460
Rym: He's got one of those red plastic cups full of beer that he spilled all over, and he's running around outside your dormitory.

801
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:37,964
Rym: I'm going,

802
00:49:38,025 --> 00:49:38,369
Rym: "Whoo!".

803
00:49:39,565 --> 00:49:40,639
Scott: Yeah, don't be that guy.

804
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:48,659
Scott: I mean, it's like, sure, everyone at college does it, whatever, but actually not so many- It's just that guy who does it.

805
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,378
Scott: Yeah, it's just no one realizes it.

806
00:49:53,007 --> 00:49:56,080
Scott: And it just stands out so much that you think it's so in, but no.

807
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:57,172
Rym: Nah, nah.

808
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:00,439
Rym: Most people who drink in college aren't that guy.

809
00:50:01,901 --> 00:50:09,840
Rym: I've noticed, though, all the people who drink too much and cause trouble with alcohol in college are the ones who had never had alcohol before college, and then they just go crazy.

810
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:14,499
Scott: Or the people where their parents just didn't let them do anything, and now they're at college, they let loose.

811
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:20,415
Scott: I mean, when I was a little kid, my mom wouldn't let me eat the peanut butter or the butter out of the-.

812
00:50:20,701 --> 00:50:22,140
Rym: Oh, if you got a hold of that peanut butter?

813
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:25,240
Scott: Yeah, I would have just eaten it all right out of the freaking jar, right?

814
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:28,378
Scott: But I said, "Man, as soon as I'm out of here, I'm going to eat a whole jar of peanut

815
00:50:28,398 --> 00:50:28,619
Scott: butter.".

816
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,376
Scott: But by the time I was out of there, I was so smart, I knew that eating the jar of peanut butter was a bad idea.

817
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,037
Scott: You know?

818
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,960
Scott: But it's like, these kids were like, "As soon as I'm out of here, I'm going to drink myself

819
00:50:38,065 --> 00:50:38,358
Scott: stupid.".

820
00:50:38,501 --> 00:50:40,600
Scott: And then as soon as they got out of there, they drank themselves stupid.

821
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:41,271
Rym: Yup.

822
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,639
Scott: Well, I think they were stupid before, that's why they drank so much.

823
00:50:49,336 --> 00:50:50,049
Rym: Ask girls out.

824
00:50:50,711 --> 00:50:51,870
Scott: Asking girls out is good.

825
00:50:52,250 --> 00:51:02,470
Rym: Because all I'll really say about that is that most people... Well, I guess to put it very bluntly, girls like boys just as much as boys like girls.

826
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:09,228
Scott: And when you're out of college, it's a lot harder to find girls that are your age to ask out.

827
00:51:09,612 --> 00:51:13,070
Scott: And a lot harder to find situations in which asking them out is appropriate.

828
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,530
Rym: Yeah, I noticed you're having some trouble on that front.

829
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:18,709
Scott: I'm not really looking too hard, but, you know.

830
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:19,217
Rym: Yeah.

831
00:51:19,931 --> 00:51:20,134
Scott: Mr.

832
00:51:20,174 --> 00:51:21,127
Scott: Penis is always on.

833
00:51:23,537 --> 00:51:24,150
Scott: And he retires.

834
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:29,769
Rym: Well, in general, not just girls, it's hard to meet people when you're out of college who are like-minded.

835
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:30,683
Scott: Yeah.

836
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:35,049
Rym: I mean, in college, you go to the gaming club and there's a million geeks playing games and you make friends for life.

837
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:38,470
Rym: You go to the anime club and there's a million geeks watching anime and you make friends for life.

838
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:44,529
Rym: It's a geek college, but even if you're not a geek, if you go to- You join the theater group and you meet a bunch of theater-type people and they're friends for life.

839
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:44,944
Rym: Yeah.

840
00:51:46,231 --> 00:51:51,150
Scott: Even if you're at like some normal state school, you know, some sport you play, or even an intramural sport.

841
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:54,370
Scott: I mean, my brother does intramural dodgeball and he met a bunch of people there.

842
00:51:54,553 --> 00:51:54,725
Scott: Yeah.

843
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:57,050
Scott: You know, kind of random, but it works.

844
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:05,229
Rym: Because really, once you get out of college, it's hard to meet new people and a lot of the people you meet are not as cool as you would like them to be.

845
00:52:05,853 --> 00:52:08,850
Scott: Mostly because they've been out of college and they haven't been doing cool stuff.

846
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:12,410
Rym: A lot of people leave college and they give up and they become uncool.

847
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:14,360
Rym: And we'll probably have another.

848
00:52:14,561 --> 00:52:15,750
Rym: how not to suck about that.

849
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:17,850
Scott: How to not suck after college?

850
00:52:18,191 --> 00:52:18,949
Rym: Yeah, something like that.

851
00:52:19,352 --> 00:52:19,463
Scott: Yeah.

852
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:25,410
Scott: An important thing to do in college is always to not suck with money.

853
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:32,389
Rym: Yeah, we have a- God, we have a friend of ours, someone we know- Named you who got his car repo'd.

854
00:52:33,572 --> 00:52:39,270
Rym: Yeah, but that was more because the money stopped coming in from sources that I was expecting it to come in from for a long time.

855
00:52:40,154 --> 00:52:40,688
Scott: Don't do that.

856
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:54,150
Rym: Yeah, but we had a friend who didn't have any money and then he got some money from a student loan and instead of buying, you know, food or books, brought a drum set.

857
00:52:55,091 --> 00:52:55,690
Scott: Real useful.

858
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:57,569
Scott: Does he- did he at least play the drums?

859
00:52:58,314 --> 00:52:59,289
Rym: As far as I heard, no.

860
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:01,630
Scott: Yeah, just wasting money.

861
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:05,810
Scott: Trying to buy a little social currency and then not spending the social currency.

862
00:53:06,732 --> 00:53:09,590
Scott: I'll convert my real currency to social currency, which I will not spend.

863
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:16,389
Rym: See, at least we had another friend who had the projector in his apartment as social currency, but that was not the only currency he had.

864
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:18,630
Scott: No, it was not the only currency he had.

865
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:21,090
Scott: And also he had the money to buy the projector.

866
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:22,569
Rym: Yes, and also buy food.

867
00:53:24,251 --> 00:53:28,929
Scott: And not only was the projector great social currency, but, you know, it also was very entertaining.

868
00:53:29,598 --> 00:53:29,789
Rym: Yeah.

869
00:53:30,631 --> 00:53:36,570
Scott: Like, for real, not just like, you know, something to show, like, come look at my thing and then you start a conversation and then you're done.

870
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:39,650
Scott: It's, hey, keep coming to my house because I have the thing.

871
00:53:40,077 --> 00:53:40,310
Rym: Yeah.

872
00:53:40,731 --> 00:53:45,350
Rym: In fact, after- because our house was kind of the hangout place just because we were the ones that had the most furniture.

873
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:53,570
Rym: And then when we left, his house became the hangout place and then he left and now it's all in the air because we're the old men who don't go there anymore.

874
00:53:55,353 --> 00:53:56,070
Scott: Don't be old men.

875
00:53:56,271 --> 00:53:56,627
Scott: Oh, wait.

876
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,028
Rym: Don't get old.

877
00:53:59,036 --> 00:53:59,648
Scott: That doesn't work.

878
00:54:02,431 --> 00:54:06,669
Scott: Another important thing to do in college is keep track of what's going on.

879
00:54:07,151 --> 00:54:14,929
Scott: If you're not on tap to the events happening in the school and the news in the school and the news in the world, a lot of things are going to pass you by.

880
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:15,984
Scott: Yeah.

881
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:21,427
Scott: I mean, there are funny things happening and awesome things happening at colleges more than anywhere else.

882
00:54:22,211 --> 00:54:27,727
Scott: And if you don't try to find them, you're just going to miss all of them and it's going to suck.

883
00:54:28,753 --> 00:54:38,463
Rym: I mean, all these cool things you learn by finding out like the secret passages because there were secret passages at RIT and we found them because we met people who knew about them.

884
00:54:38,971 --> 00:54:45,748
Rym: Or like the cool hidden club that meets after hours somewhere or the freaking dodgeball club that just plays dodgeball every day.

885
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:54,310
Scott: I mean, but it's even other stuff like we saw that we- the thing of the day a while ago was the video of like Pac-Man running into a chemistry lab.

886
00:54:55,251 --> 00:55:01,970
Scott: You know, if you can keep track of stuff like that, then you can go around and see those sorts of funny things happening at your school all the time.

887
00:55:02,372 --> 00:55:04,089
Rym: Or take one step further and be that guy.

888
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:05,469
Scott: Yeah, you can be that guy.

889
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:06,209
Scott: That's even better.

890
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:09,169
Rym: We were several times close to that guy.

891
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:09,665
Scott: Yep.

892
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:15,390
Scott: But if you hide in the dorm all day, just minding your own business, doing your homework, you'll never see those things.

893
00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:19,050
Scott: And college will be a lot less fun than it is because the fun will be behind wall.

894
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:22,270
Scott: But it'll be you and a wall in between you and the fun.

895
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:22,781
Scott: Yeah.

896
00:55:23,051 --> 00:55:23,284
Scott: Yeah.

897
00:55:23,913 --> 00:55:28,149
Scott: There's a wall between you and the fun, and if you don't peek around the wall, you're gonna have a lot less fun.

898
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:32,869
Rym: Like, if you're into German board games and you play with your four friends in your dorm every night, that's fun.

899
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:39,230
Rym: But if you're just gonna play the board game anyway, go play it in the middle of some building somewhere on campus.

900
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:41,010
Rym: And you'll have a million people walk by and, "What's that?

901
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:41,175
Rym: Ooh!".

902
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:42,610
Rym: And then you'll meet more people.

903
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:43,190
Scott: Yeah.

904
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:46,330
Scott: Add, you know, get your social currency's worth out of your board game.

905
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:48,786
Scott: And at the same time, something cool might happen there.

906
00:55:48,827 --> 00:55:49,270
Scott: that you'll see.

907
00:55:49,616 --> 00:55:49,830
Scott: Yeah.

908
00:55:50,071 --> 00:55:53,730
Rym: That's how we met a lot of our friends, by indulging in our geekeries publicly.

909
00:55:54,310 --> 00:56:00,390
Rym: And other people who had interest in those geekeries came to see what all the hubbub was and joined our little rolling katamari of geek culture.

910
00:56:11,985 --> 00:56:14,090
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

911
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:16,689
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

912
00:56:17,594 --> 00:56:18,230
Scott: Thanks for listening.
