1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,698
Rym: It's Tuesday, December 8th, 2015.

2
00:00:10,698 --> 00:00:10,879
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:14,270
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,076
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,578 --> 00:00:19,369
Rym: Starwall and ResPublica.

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,928
Rym: Kind of an odd combination there.

7
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:24,368
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,049
Rym: So our friends Laura and Scott have a huge party like once or twice a year.

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,990
Rym: And we went this year over the weekend taking trains to get to and from Philly and all this business.

10
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,090
Rym: But something astounding happened.

11
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:49,230
Rym: Scott, our friend Chase and I, on the way home we're standing at a SEPTA station, like a light rail station, waiting for the train to take us to Philly so we could take our respective buses.

12
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,230
Scott: Isn't it actually a light rail?

13
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:52,428
Rym: It's more like commuter rail, I guess.

14
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,275
Scott: But it's just.

15
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:54,389
Scott: the train isn't very long.

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,610
Rym: I mean, you know what it's like?

17
00:00:56,032 --> 00:00:56,950
Scott: It's a full-size train.

18
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,950
Rym: It's like a slow metro north.

19
00:00:59,632 --> 00:01:00,409
Scott: Didn't go that slow.

20
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,069
Rym: It went slow until it got out of the one-track area, at least.

21
00:01:05,035 --> 00:01:05,990
Rym: So we're standing there.

22
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,309
Rym: It's like this train would fuck you up if it hit you.

23
00:01:09,473 --> 00:01:12,530
Scott: I mean, there is no train on earth, even the lightest rail.

24
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:15,110
Rym: An HO-scale train would not fuck you up if it hit you.

25
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,679
Scott: Dude, it would still hurt if it hit your foot.

26
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,062
Scott: You'd be like, "Ow,

27
00:01:17,183 --> 00:01:17,323
Scott: fuck.".

28
00:01:19,191 --> 00:01:20,308
Rym: So we're standing there.

29
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,469
Scott: Especially if it's going full speed.

30
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,748
Rym: And Chase points out and says, "Hey, isn't that car stopped on the train

31
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:25,010
Rym: tracks?".

32
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:32,390
Rym: And we look up and sure enough, there's this woman sitting in a car, just parked on the train tracks, waiting to turn left or whatever.

33
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,309
Scott: Well, yeah, because it's like you pull out.

34
00:01:35,393 --> 00:01:37,010
Scott: People pull out into the intersection to make a left.

35
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,430
Scott: They block the box and then they go.

36
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,509
Scott: And in the city, when you block the box, well, you're in the box.

37
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,930
Scott: But in the suburbs, usually you block the box and the light turns green and then you go.

38
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,862
Scott: And the train comes by.

39
00:01:46,923 --> 00:01:47,510
Scott: how often?

40
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,750
Scott: It's like you don't really believe it.

41
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,220
Rym: Except those trains came by every 20-ish minutes.

42
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,250
Rym: Actually, less than 20 minutes because there's one one way and then one the other way.

43
00:01:54,470 --> 00:02:01,930
Scott: Yeah, but I guess, you know, when you drove your car everywhere, how often, when you came across a train crossing, was there actually a train?

44
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:07,110
Rym: Still often, but I grew up in a place in the Midwest where there's a lot of freight tracks that just go across the street.

45
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,589
Scott: I mean, I think I've waited in my car for trains to go by maybe like three times ever, maybe only twice.

46
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,969
Rym: All right, I waited for a train almost once a week.

47
00:02:15,913 --> 00:02:16,769
Rym: That's just where I grew up.

48
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,749
Rym: And the septic trains, they're going like pretty often.

49
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,706
Rym: But so anyway, this woman sitting there and she's like, "Hey, wouldn't it be funny if she's got hit by the

50
00:02:23,747 --> 00:02:23,929
Rym: train?".

51
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,449
Rym: And we were just being jerks and laughing.

52
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,870
Scott: Just kind of hoping she would get hit by the train.

53
00:02:27,512 --> 00:02:29,385
Rym: And then we hear the train noises.

54
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:33,889
Rym: And then the gate comes down behind her and the other gate comes down.

55
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,830
Rym: The train's coming and she's just sitting there like fucking around on her phone.

56
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:42,829
Rym: So I'm like walking over, kind of like, because it's like right there.

57
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:45,090
Rym: And I see bit by bit like everyone on the train.

58
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,429
Scott: I'm getting my phone ready so we can get some world stuff.

59
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,768
Rym: Everyone on the train platform is like kind of watching like, "Oh, what's going

60
00:02:50,929 --> 00:02:50,969
Rym: on?".

61
00:02:51,332 --> 00:02:52,930
Rym: A bunch of people nearby start honking.

62
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:54,090
Rym: She still doesn't notice.

63
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,147
Rym: Finally, I hear somewhere near her says, "What the

64
00:02:56,248 --> 00:02:56,450
Rym: fuck?".

65
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,508
Rym: Start screaming at her.

66
00:02:58,093 --> 00:03:00,550
Rym: And suddenly she looks up and looks at the train.

67
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,469
Rym: And the train is blaring its horn at this point and bearing down on her.

68
00:03:04,137 --> 00:03:04,770
Scott: And she's stopping.

69
00:03:05,611 --> 00:03:14,830
Rym: She floors it suddenly after she like freaks out, drives through, stops, and then looks around and then drives away, probably embarrassed, as fast as she can.

70
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,670
Scott: I mean, you know, in the Scott world, you lose your driver's license forever.

71
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,390
Scott: Never allowed to drive again ever anywhere.

72
00:03:21,892 --> 00:03:25,790
Scott: And also you wouldn't have been allowed to drive in the first place because you wouldn't have passed the driving test.

73
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,949
Rym: So Lady gets a couple of strikes for that.

74
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:36,789
Rym: But what makes the story astounding is that 100% of the trains that came by had a similar thing happen.

75
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,409
Scott: You mean the one other train that came by?

76
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,836
Rym: Yes, two trains.

77
00:03:40,077 --> 00:03:49,690
Rym: The next train that came, the train that we were going to ride on, comes up, and again, there was a car stopped, and the gate comes down behind him, doesn't notice right away, and then floors it and gets out of the way.

78
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,381
Rym: But he did get out of the way like 30 seconds earlier than the other Lady did.

79
00:03:54,831 --> 00:03:59,010
Rym: I was pretty much expecting to have to run over there and see if someone was alive.

80
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,430
Scott: Yet another reason not to live in the suburbs.

81
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:02,176
Rym: Yeah.

82
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:03,435
Scott: Cities only.

83
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,910
Scott: Also this city only.

84
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:11,190
Rym: It was just remarkable to me that 100% of the trains that were coming by almost hit a car because people don't know how to drive in Pennsylvania.

85
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:20,290
Scott: I'm telling you, the problem is that people can basically skirt the edge of danger without actually getting punished, right?

86
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,764
Scott: It's sort of like if you're standing on top of a mountain, or maybe a mesa, right?

87
00:04:24,945 --> 00:04:25,610
Scott: It's flat on top.

88
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:32,339
Scott: You can be safe standing in the middle, and you can be safe tap-dancing on the edge as long as you don't actually fall.

89
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:34,209
Scott: Nothing bad will happen to you.

90
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,630
Scott: So then people just tap-dance on the edge all the fucking time.

91
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,474
Rym: But it's not just that.

92
00:04:38,534 --> 00:04:41,930
Rym: It's people tap-dancing on the edge who have never had a tap-dancing lesson.

93
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:47,790
Scott: Sure, and what we should do is if someone's tap-dancing on the edge, we should not allow them to get lucky and not fall.

94
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,509
Scott: We should just push everyone who is standing on the edge.

95
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:53,239
Rym: I would not push them.

96
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,438
Rym: I would pull them back, put a little fence and say, "You can't go past the fence

97
00:04:56,518 --> 00:04:56,680
Rym: anymore.".

98
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,429
Scott: That works too, but shooting them with a gun, it's like...

99
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,188
Rym: Okay, all right.

100
00:05:03,372 --> 00:05:11,324
Scott: If you want to skirt death, then make the consequences go from low... When there's a situation...

101
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,886
Rym: The actual technical term for this is "shaking hands with

102
00:05:14,986 --> 00:05:15,388
Rym: danger.".

103
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:16,093
Scott: Right.

104
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:20,799
Scott: We should basically, when someone is shaking hands with danger, we should make it so that 100% of the time they get bit.

105
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:30,468
Scott: Then people will stop shaking hands with danger because they know that getting bit is a guaranteed thing and not some, "Oh, I'll be safe this

106
00:05:30,549 --> 00:05:30,870
Scott: time.".

107
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:40,010
Rym: So I would argue that if we go your way, then everyone who gets bit dies and there's no one who survives to tell the tale of the barbarian who came and killed everyone.

108
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:40,673
Scott: That's not true.

109
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:47,729
Scott: For example, people always hold the subway doors open, and I'm like, "Let's just put buzz saws on the inside of the subway

110
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,890
Scott: doors.".

111
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:50,270
Scott: So if you put your hand in there, you lose your hand.

112
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,327
Rym: Scott, this is where you...

113
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,670
Scott: Nobody will friggin' put their hand in there.

114
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:57,710
Rym: This is where you are an extremist, and I am merely a radical, because you say buzz saws, I say tasers.

115
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:58,846
Scott: Okay.

116
00:06:01,913 --> 00:06:02,810
Scott: What's wrong with the buzz saw?

117
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:05,562
Rym: I would just go back to the old subway doors.

118
00:06:05,602 --> 00:06:06,689
Rym: that would literally crush you.

119
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,580
Scott: But crushing delays the train.

120
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,410
Scott: The buzz saw means the train can just go with your hand on board.

121
00:06:11,491 --> 00:06:13,449
Rym: You know, I did notice today, I thought about something...

122
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,910
Scott: Or your body on board and your hand on the platform.

123
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:25,169
Rym: Today, because the 7 train was delayed, so the entire platform was full of people, so I thought of something that I never really... Like, I don't think of consciously, because I'm used to living in New York, because I'm standing on the edge of the platform.

124
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,623
Rym: And the train's coming, and of course, I'm just like, "The platform's completely full of people.

125
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:30,006
Rym: I can't

126
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:30,269
Rym: move.".

127
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:34,750
Rym: And the train's going by at a high speed, like two inches away from my face.

128
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,370
Rym: And I was just standing there reading the Kindle.

129
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,930
Scott: That's why I don't stand in the yellow area.

130
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,541
Rym: Yeah, but I kind of had to.

131
00:06:40,582 --> 00:06:41,610
Rym: I couldn't have gotten on the train.

132
00:06:42,911 --> 00:06:43,527
Scott: Get on the next one.

133
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:45,276
Rym: There was trouble.

134
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:47,690
Rym: I would not have been home if I had not forced my way onto that train.

135
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:48,580
Rym: Don't take that train.

136
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:49,170
Scott: Use a different one.

137
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:53,830
Rym: I tap dance on the edge of the Mesa, but I have at least had a few tap dancing lessons.

138
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,170
Rym: Or at least, I continue to tap dance safely.

139
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,110
Rym: You just keep going skiing.

140
00:06:59,370 --> 00:06:59,732
Scott: You know what?

141
00:07:00,074 --> 00:07:02,970
Rym: I have never parked my car on fucking train tracks.

142
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,779
Rym: But you go skiing.

143
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,749
Rym: That's pretty much the same.

144
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:12,309
Rym: I feel like rule one of driving a car is anytime you stop it, just look to the left and just see if you're on train tracks.

145
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:14,338
Rym: At least make sure.

146
00:07:14,358 --> 00:07:16,029
Rym: Just make sure your hand is not in a toaster.

147
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:22,810
Scott: I mean, I never had to look left to see if I'm on train tracks because I look ahead and see railroad crossing signs and I don't go across.

148
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:23,817
Rym: But at least you went through.

149
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:26,515
Rym: You have this mental model of, "Alright, I'm stopping my car.

150
00:07:26,636 --> 00:07:27,601
Rym: Am I on train tracks?

151
00:07:28,024 --> 00:07:28,205
Rym: No.".

152
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:31,609
Rym: So anyway, got any gaming news?

153
00:07:32,132 --> 00:07:33,050
Scott: I do have a gaming news.

154
00:07:34,695 --> 00:07:36,590
Scott: If you don't know, it's Hanukkah.

155
00:07:37,192 --> 00:07:37,694
Scott: Oh shit.

156
00:07:38,276 --> 00:07:43,821
Scott: Time for some light festivals or magic oils and latkes, which is the real oil.

157
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:44,970
Rym: The real magical oil.

158
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,870
Rym: There's a menorah over the entrance to my building.

159
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,110
Rym: It had white lights when I came in this morning.

160
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,390
Rym: And then when I left, it was the same menorah with blue lights.

161
00:07:52,991 --> 00:07:53,414
Scott: That's nice.

162
00:07:53,635 --> 00:07:54,683
Scott: Cool fancy menorah.

163
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:09,769
Scott: Anyway, I don't know how much everyone listening knows about Jewishness, but on Hanukkah, there's actually a game that goes with Hanukkah, unlike a lot of other holidays, which don't have their own games.

164
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:15,228
Scott: Hanukkah has an official game, which is great for nerds, and the game is dreidel.

165
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,089
Scott: And what is dreidel?

166
00:08:16,471 --> 00:08:18,709
Scott: If you don't know, it's a top, like you spin it.

167
00:08:19,672 --> 00:08:20,039
Rym: It's a D4.

168
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,754
Rym: In Mega Man 3.

169
00:08:21,754 --> 00:08:22,850
Rym: It's a four-sided die.

170
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:23,742
Scott: It's effectively a D4.

171
00:08:25,831 --> 00:08:32,530
Scott: And basically, the way it works is you have some pool of chips or goodies or candy or guilt or whatever it is.

172
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,229
Rym: Just actual money.

173
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,049
Scott: Actual whatever.

174
00:08:34,892 --> 00:08:41,110
Scott: And when you spin it, if you get a gimel, which is G, you fucking get everything, right?

175
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:42,929
Scott: If you get hay, you get half.

176
00:08:43,712 --> 00:08:45,129
Scott: If you get nun, you get bupkis.

177
00:08:47,214 --> 00:08:49,567
Scott: And if you get the other one-- What's the other one?

178
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,090
Scott: Shin, maybe?

179
00:08:51,354 --> 00:08:51,766
Scott: I don't know.

180
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,528
Scott: I think it's shin.

181
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,149
Scott: You lose half, right?

182
00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:01,148
Scott: So it's really, in the words of our friend Joshua, dreidel is an awful game.

183
00:09:01,852 --> 00:09:03,230
Rym: Like, I'd rather play Monopoly.

184
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:03,435
Rym: Yeah.

185
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,148
Rym: So-- It's on the level of war.

186
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,310
Scott: So he made this post, and it says, let's fix dreidel.

187
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,369
Scott: Jewish game designers, let's get on this.

188
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:15,970
Rym: This is so great.

189
00:09:16,591 --> 00:09:19,850
Scott: So here's the rules for the fixing dreidel, I guess.

190
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:24,170
Scott: I don't even know if this is a contest, but here's the rules for designing a game to fix dreidel.

191
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:30,249
Scott: So the dreidel has to be in the name of the game, and it has to feature the dreidel centrally, if not entirely.

192
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:35,690
Scott: It has to be playable with a reasonable number of dreidels from one to, I don't know, a dozen or something.

193
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,828
Scott: The number you might have in your box of Hanukkah stuff.

194
00:09:40,812 --> 00:09:44,369
Scott: It has to obey all the mitzvah and the minhagim.

195
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:46,689
Rym: Regarding the chag.

196
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:47,488
Rym: Chag?

197
00:09:47,912 --> 00:09:48,001
Scott: Yeah.

198
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:49,350
Scott: Right.

199
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,810
Scott: So basically, if you don't know the-- What's drash?

200
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:54,437
Scott: OK.

201
00:09:54,891 --> 00:09:56,989
Scott: So let's say you're a rabbi.

202
00:09:58,617 --> 00:09:58,660
Scott: OK?

203
00:09:59,394 --> 00:10:01,770
Scott: And somebody asks you a rabbi kind of question.

204
00:10:02,531 --> 00:10:05,669
Rym: A rabbi, can I eat this kind of thing on this particular-- Well, more like rabbi.

205
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,504
Scott: Why do we-- what is the meaning behind this particular thing?

206
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,789
Rym: I'm thinking of a Simpsons not rabbi.

207
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,110
Rym: Should I buy a Ford or a Chevy?

208
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:12,644
Scott: Right.

209
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,789
Scott: No, not that kind of rabbi.

210
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:20,870
Scott: So basically, what the rabbi will do is, depending on who you are, he'll give you a different kind of explanation.

211
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:21,630
Scott: Right?

212
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:31,670
Scott: There's the explanation that he would give to somebody who's an intelligent adult, knows a lot of Torah shit, the real explanation.

213
00:10:32,851 --> 00:10:41,109
Scott: And then there's the explanation for the common person that he's going to give, probably to someone who only comes on the high holiday or a goyim.

214
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:47,169
Rym: It's like the science equivalent of wash your hands because I said so versus wash your hands because they're covered in bacteria.

215
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,229
Scott: Yes, exactly.

216
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:57,150
Scott: So basically, you've got to have some religious action going on, some meaning to your game related to Hanukkah.

217
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:57,647
Rym: So what's chag?

218
00:10:59,291 --> 00:10:59,849
Rym: What's chag?

219
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:00,628
Scott: I'm not sure.

220
00:11:01,534 --> 00:11:03,329
Scott: So anyway, one of them is-- I don't know.

221
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:08,230
Scott: Anyway, use only things that a family is likely to have around on Hanukkah.

222
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:12,030
Rym: Already burning candles, oil lamps, drunk adults.

223
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:12,590
Scott: Right.

224
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,630
Scott: It has to be playable by everyone.

225
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,310
Scott: You can't be having some game the little kids can't play.

226
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,929
Rym: Anyone old enough to clumsily spin a dreidel.

227
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:20,446
Scott: Right.

228
00:11:21,251 --> 00:11:27,770
Scott: It has to be playable by someone who's smart and someone-- it can't be like a game where it's-- the kids can play, but the adults are like, oh my god.

229
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:32,268
Rym: Quote, "Mature kids who can develop strategies, weigh risks, and do other mature adult-like

230
00:11:32,288 --> 00:11:32,490
Rym: behaviors.".

231
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:42,249
Scott: Be playable by adults of a much shorter attention span than kids and need to be entertained with systems like deal-making, ribald puns, cost-benefit analysis, and drinking.

232
00:11:43,753 --> 00:11:45,850
Scott: It has to be a public domain game.

233
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,448
Scott: So this prize is here.

234
00:11:48,852 --> 00:11:53,290
Scott: First prize, in retrospect, centuries from now, this will be how everyone has always played dreidel.

235
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,589
Scott: It will be an obvious Minhag that every child learns.

236
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:03,530
Scott: Second prize, in retrospect, centuries from now, this will be how everyone has always played dreidel, but everyone knows that lots of people play it wrong.

237
00:12:06,552 --> 00:12:15,890
Scott: So yeah, if you can design a game around dreidel, or any game you can design for D4s and put on a Hanukkah theme is going to meet the criteria.

238
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:16,749
Rym: I mean, think of it this way.

239
00:12:17,131 --> 00:12:25,469
Rym: The best way to prove your mettle as a game designer is to set some arbitrary constraints and try to make a simple game that meets a bunch of parameters within those constraints.

240
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,350
Scott: So, dreidel game design contest.

241
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,569
Rym: I expect good ideas in the forum.

242
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:32,830
Rym: I want to see what you guys come up with.

243
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:33,710
Scott: I can't come up with anything.

244
00:12:34,092 --> 00:12:38,588
Rym: I kind of came up with a role-playing game, but it's like a cut-down version of the sword that uses D4.

245
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:39,946
Scott: Can't be a role-playing game.

246
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:40,586
Rym: Why not?

247
00:12:41,232 --> 00:12:43,030
Scott: A role-playing game doesn't, you can't do that.

248
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,267
Rym: Why can't it be?

249
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,729
Scott: It's some one person drew to Maccabee, the other person.

250
00:12:48,113 --> 00:12:49,169
Rym: Still working out the details.

251
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:56,249
Rym: So, in other news, this is kind of relevant to GeekNights and also gaming in a general sense.

252
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:05,570
Rym: So, this article talks about how linguists have identified an accent or a dialect or some combination.

253
00:13:05,671 --> 00:13:34,109
Rym: that seems to exist pretty much entirely on YouTube and Twitch channels, which in retrospect makes a lot of sense, because there was a lot of evidence that once TV became standard, I mean, that's when the standard American Midwestern generic neutral accent became the media accent, because suddenly, as TV became more and more national, most people were hearing voices on a regular basis that were like this default, like you sort of melded together with a generic accent.

254
00:13:34,671 --> 00:13:41,610
Rym: So, unless you have a very strong regional accent that you also hear, you'll eventually drift toward this common one, like generation over generation.

255
00:13:42,434 --> 00:14:07,510
Rym: The internet is interesting in that communities of people are continuously sharing podcasts and YouTube videos and Let's Plays, and this article talks about what the YouTube accent looks like, and it's kind of fascinating, because Scott and I both do a lot of these things, as do most of our podcaster friends, almost every Let's Play person I've ever seen who's popular, and actually Crash Course, all those guys.

256
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:11,889
Rym: They do this so close to the way it's described that it's uncanny.

257
00:14:13,171 --> 00:14:14,590
Rym: So, I'd recommend you read this.

258
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:24,369
Rym: I mean, this is what it comes down to, and you can read the article, look at all the details, there's a bunch of follow-up stories and everything, but the components are, one, over-stressed vowels.

259
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:32,650
Rym: So, like, instead of making a schwa, you'll say the syllables, and the vowel syllables, at least, very strongly in words you say.

260
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,470
Rym: You won't kind of "eh" the syllables.

261
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,790
Rym: Like, exactly, instead of exactly, or exactly.

262
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,369
Rym: Like, you'll stress all those bits along the way.

263
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,449
Rym: Sneaking extra vowels in between consonants.

264
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:51,670
Rym: So, instead of trapping, they'll actually, you'll hear the sort of terrapping, you'll hear this "eh" coming in, like splitting up the bits.

265
00:14:52,611 --> 00:14:56,248
Rym: There's technical terms for all this, but I don't know shit about linguistics, so I'm not even going to try.

266
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:04,689
Rym: A lot more long vowels, long consonants as well, and actually, lots of aspiration and plosives.

267
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:10,529
Rym: So, people who need pop filters tend to be the kinds of people who do this accent by default.

268
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:22,687
Rym: And it's interesting, because the accent, it was described variously as intellectual used car salesman voice, or educated carnival barker.

269
00:15:24,513 --> 00:15:33,268
Rym: But, after I read this article, I went and watched a whole bunch of let's plays and everything, and I started hearing it, I started noticing it, I started hearing it in both of us.

270
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:47,510
Rym: And it seems like what this accent does is it creates this sense that the person speaking knows more about what they're talking about than they might, that they're speaking-- I thought that that's any accent from the UK, but only when used in the US.

271
00:15:47,952 --> 00:15:48,909
Rym: Ah, that is also true.

272
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:55,229
Rym: But it also includes enough patter and padding and things-- Except for chav accents.

273
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:58,030
Scott: And pikey, where no one understands what you're saying.

274
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:11,046
Rym: The conversation sort of keeps going, and pregnant pauses are not interrupted by someone expecting to ask a question or talk to you, but get that TED Talk style sort of like, "The pause means what they just said was really

275
00:16:11,106 --> 00:16:11,650
Rym: profound.".

276
00:16:13,413 --> 00:16:24,930
Rym: And I just think this is fascinating, and I encourage you all to read this, and if you're going to do a podcast and you don't have radio training, I don't know, just read this article and try to do those things and listen to what other people do.

277
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,590
Scott: I don't think this is something you can do constantly, I mean, consciously.

278
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:34,629
Scott: I think the way you acquire this is just by watching a lot of YouTube and then making a lot of YouTube, and it'll happen without you even knowing it happens.

279
00:16:34,891 --> 00:16:40,970
Rym: Will kids growing up watching Let's Plays all the time have that accent more so than their parents' accent?

280
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:41,989
Scott: Just in everyday life?

281
00:16:42,214 --> 00:16:42,488
Rym: Yeah.

282
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:43,909
Scott: They're all trying to sell each other?

283
00:16:46,454 --> 00:16:48,470
Scott: Talk to the teacher in Carl's salesman voice?

284
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,822
Scott: "Step right up, check this homework care, I got an A+ coming

285
00:16:51,842 --> 00:16:52,064
Scott: through.".

286
00:16:54,672 --> 00:17:07,069
Rym: But it's also that it's an accent that typically in the past was only seen in people who are lecturing to an audience, but now that that sort of lecturing-to-an-audience style is so common in pop culture...

287
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,108
Scott: No, the only time you'll talk to people is to lecture to them.

288
00:17:09,431 --> 00:17:10,049
Rym: Oh yeah, that's true.

289
00:17:11,011 --> 00:17:13,210
Scott: Otherwise you'll just type at them if it's a conversation.

290
00:17:20,852 --> 00:17:23,150
Rym: But anyway, things of the day!

291
00:17:23,671 --> 00:17:27,250
Rym: This is just an animated gif, but it is so delicious.

292
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,469
Scott: I mean, it's a good gif, but Rym is going way crazy over it.

293
00:17:31,012 --> 00:17:41,310
Rym: As you watch this, imagine that the rocket, in fact, has sentience and a malevolent intelligence and that it has decided to do this of its own will.

294
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,989
Rym: Because it's just a bottle rocket.

295
00:17:43,891 --> 00:17:45,629
Scott: It's not a bottle rocket, it's a model rocket.

296
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:52,010
Rym: It's like a model rocket, but dude, it just hits the igniter, and just as he's hit it, it starts falling over.

297
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,330
Scott: That igniter chord is way shorter than we used to use.

298
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:55,889
Scott: We used to use way longer ones.

299
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:02,088
Rym: But it's falling forward, directly toward him, just as he has ignited it.

300
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:04,765
Rym: And there's the moment of "oh

301
00:18:05,108 --> 00:18:05,249
Rym: shit.".

302
00:18:05,411 --> 00:18:10,269
Scott: I think what's actually happening is that the chord is so short, he pulled on the remote, which is what pulled it towards him.

303
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,590
Rym: Yeah, but there's no motion there, unless it was cut off before the gif.

304
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,490
Scott: You can't see the chord because it's so low res.

305
00:18:15,874 --> 00:18:17,129
Rym: But his hands do not move.

306
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,308
Scott: I don't know.

307
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:19,150
Rym: It might have just fallen.

308
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,849
Rym: I mean, I've had model rockets fall just because...

309
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,162
Scott: It's definitely possible.

310
00:18:24,182 --> 00:18:24,830
Scott: It doesn't matter.

311
00:18:25,376 --> 00:18:26,590
Scott: The point is, it hit him in the butt.

312
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:39,190
Rym: Yes, the sublime moment of, there's the parapetia, where he realizes what is happening immediately, and is doing what any human being would do, and then the rocket reaches out and just bops him on the butt.

313
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,129
Scott: Get a longer chord next time.

314
00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:47,930
Rym: Hey, some of the model rockets I had back in the day, before I had an electric ignition system, you'd light a fucking fuse.

315
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:49,810
Scott: I've never used a non-electric ignition system for a model rocket.

316
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,948
Scott: The electric ones came later.

317
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,030
Scott: For a model rocket, I've never used a non-electric one.

318
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,970
Rym: Were you a Quest kid or an Estes kid?

319
00:18:56,293 --> 00:18:57,610
Scott: I never did it myself.

320
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,470
Scott: I always did it at summer camp or school or whatever, right?

321
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,570
Scott: So whatever they bought.

322
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,770
Scott: So sometimes it was one, and sometimes it was the other.

323
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,370
Scott: At nerd summer camp, it was the best, because they just had the catalogs fucking there.

324
00:19:08,771 --> 00:19:14,670
Scott: And the way it would work is, first, you'd have to go in and make some shitty little wizard rocket to prove that you could make a rocket.

325
00:19:15,332 --> 00:19:22,169
Rym: That basically involves literally glue a tube to some fins, stick a cone in the top, tie one string between the inside.

326
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:23,390
Scott: I was painting it, right?

327
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:23,970
Scott: But anyway.

328
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:24,510
Rym: Spray paint.

329
00:19:24,911 --> 00:19:28,590
Scott: So once you made the wizard and proved that you could make a rocket.

330
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,129
Rym: Actually, the wizard came pre-painted, I think.

331
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,899
Scott: No, it didn't.

332
00:19:30,939 --> 00:19:31,429
Scott: Not this one.

333
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,930
Scott: Anyway, once you made a wizard, right?

334
00:19:35,093 --> 00:19:36,610
Scott: I don't know if it was actually a kit, right?

335
00:19:38,353 --> 00:19:39,130
Rym: It's not the wizard.

336
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,850
Rym: The wizard's the famous Estes rocket.

337
00:19:41,211 --> 00:19:43,510
Scott: Right, but the point is, it was basically, right?

338
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:49,670
Scott: They didn't... It was like a model rocket hut, and they just had tons and tons of fucking supplies.

339
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:50,296
Scott: No, no.

340
00:19:50,317 --> 00:19:50,570
Rym: You're right.

341
00:19:50,752 --> 00:19:52,590
Rym: You have to paint it and then put the decals on it.

342
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,870
Scott: Right, but they didn't give you the kit.

343
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:59,490
Scott: You just basically made... You took a cardboard tube that was wizard-sized, and you took some fins out of the box, right?

344
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:00,801
Scott: They didn't have kits.

345
00:20:00,821 --> 00:20:01,650
Scott: They just had stuff.

346
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,730
Scott: So you made the rocket, right?

347
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:12,580
Scott: And once you've leveled up enough, you know, making different rockets, they would let you just sort of do whatever the fuck you wanted, as long as they would look at your plan and be like, "Okay, you can do that.

348
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:13,088
Scott: That's not going to kill

349
00:20:13,108 --> 00:20:13,250
Scott: anybody.".

350
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,089
Rym: Three stages, three G engines each, metal nose cone.

351
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,968
Scott: Right, so then, twice during camp, right?

352
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:26,570
Scott: At the end of the eight-week camp, at the end of the fourth week and the end of the eighth week, they would do model rocket day, where everyone would just sit on the lawn and launch every rocket.

353
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:31,086
Scott: And at the beginning of the day, no one would go, because it was just like wizard, wizard, wizard, wizard, wizard, right?

354
00:20:31,691 --> 00:20:35,905
Scott: But then, once he got past lunchtime, it was like, "All right, Johnny's two stages

355
00:20:35,965 --> 00:20:36,307
Scott: coming.".

356
00:20:36,872 --> 00:20:40,609
Scott: And you'd see they'd have all the rockets set up on the lawn that were waiting to launch.

357
00:20:41,313 --> 00:20:47,370
Scott: And you would see, like, at the end of the line, this kid had one that was like a one-foot circumference tube.

358
00:20:47,617 --> 00:20:47,907
Rym: Yup.

359
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,886
Scott: And he's just like, "You're just waiting for the good

360
00:20:49,927 --> 00:20:50,169
Scott: shit.".

361
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,512
Rym: Depending on where you grew up, engines went up to G instead of just D. Oh, yeah.

362
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:56,290
Scott: I mean, this is in the middle of nowhere Pennsylvania summer camp of nerds.

363
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:01,890
Scott: So, like, some kids would make ones that had, like, not stages, but, like, a bundle of four rockets at the bottom.

364
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,157
Rym: Yup, I made some of those.

365
00:21:03,318 --> 00:21:05,270
Rym: I made one that was multiple stage with that.

366
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:10,049
Scott: You had people, like, a double parachute set up going on, all kinds, you know, fins in the middle.

367
00:21:10,411 --> 00:21:12,730
Rym: I lost three-quarters of any of the rockets I ever made.

368
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,701
Scott: Right, you know, but that was a good day.

369
00:21:14,802 --> 00:21:16,210
Scott: Anyway, my thing of the day.

370
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:29,450
Scott: So, sometimes at a sporting event, you know, there's people on the field, especially when it's a televised sporting event or rink or court or whatever field of play, who have microphones on them for various reasons.

371
00:21:29,551 --> 00:21:32,110
Scott: Maybe they're communicating with their coaches or other players.

372
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:37,441
Scott: Maybe they're, you know, maybe they're refs and they need to talk to the whole, you know, people in attendance.

373
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:38,930
Scott: or they need to talk to the television.

374
00:21:39,292 --> 00:21:44,585
Scott: or maybe they just mic'd up some players, you know, so they can hear the quarterback going, like, "Blue 22," whatever.

375
00:21:46,253 --> 00:22:04,630
Scott: And on occasion, intentionally or unintentionally, you hear things on those microphones, being a spectator, either in the stands or at home watching on television, that you were not supposed to hear, you, you know, shouldn't be hearing or are unusual to hear because you're not on the field of play.

376
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,510
Scott: That's not a place that you experience as a spectator.

377
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:11,750
Rym: Not like one fan just happens to be close to one of the mics and, like, you hear that guy yell a lot.

378
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,490
Scott: No, things the players, refs or coaches are saying.

379
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:13,812
Scott: Yeah.

380
00:22:14,075 --> 00:22:16,070
Scott: Now, this happens relatively frequently.

381
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,550
Scott: There was an incident very recently at an ice hockey game.

382
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:26,390
Scott: And here, my thing of the day, is a compilation video of some of the best times that this has happened over the years.

383
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:30,010
Scott: And it's a very recently made video, so it includes that very recent incident.

384
00:22:30,992 --> 00:22:36,470
Scott: Actually, quite a few incidents from just the past few weeks, as well as many from over the years.

385
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:37,068
Rym: Many classics.

386
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:43,429
Scott: I've seen, I'd already seen about at least more than half of these, but there were still some that were new to me.

387
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,728
Scott: I imagine most will be new to you.

388
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,170
Rym: In the meantime, the Book Club was the wheel of time.

389
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,722
Rym: I'm on, like, book seven.

390
00:22:50,742 --> 00:22:51,569
Rym: I know stuff.

391
00:22:52,411 --> 00:22:56,410
Scott: I stopped reading, and I did not pick up since we last mentioned.

392
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:01,010
Rym: Yup, so I'll probably do a new book club soon, but might just burn through the rest of these books.

393
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,449
Rym: Like, I'm kind of just churning through them at this point.

394
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,867
Scott: You're not even halfway done, even if I said.

395
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:07,210
Rym: I know, but at the same time.

396
00:23:07,311 --> 00:23:08,949
Scott: Aren't there, like, 13 books or something like that?

397
00:23:08,949 --> 00:23:10,188
Rym: 14, I think?

398
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:10,869
Scott: Okay.

399
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:11,570
Scott: So I'm about halfway.

400
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,848
Rym: I just got to kill time before the next Prince of Nothing book comes out.

401
00:23:17,014 --> 00:23:18,229
Scott: Must have killed time, boy.

402
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:21,170
Rym: Can I get five bucks to go get loaded?

403
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:27,570
Rym: So, we can officially announce we have at least two panels at PAX South 2016.

404
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,609
Scott: And I'm definitely going because I bought a plane ticket, and I reserved a hotel room, and man is it cheap.

405
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:41,050
Rym: Yeah, it is cheaper from us in New York to go to PAX South, like, in total, than it is to go to PAX East in Boston.

406
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,230
Scott: Well, not if you count the time, but, you know, the money cost.

407
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:48,390
Rym: Yeah, the cost of the flights, not much more than Amtrak to Boston.

408
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:51,730
Rym: Hotel, less than half what it costs for a hotel in Boston.

409
00:23:52,171 --> 00:23:54,129
Scott: PAX South, as far as I know, is not sold out.

410
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:55,069
Rym: It is not.

411
00:23:55,311 --> 00:24:03,948
Scott: As the other PAX's are, so it's like, if you want to go to PAX, and you can't go to East or Prime or whatever, even if you frickin' live in Seattle or Boston, it'll probably be cheaper for you to go.

412
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,270
Rym: Also, that convention center is great.

413
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:07,530
Rym: There's great food there.

414
00:24:07,631 --> 00:24:09,050
Scott: It's okay, it's not great, it's okay.

415
00:24:09,311 --> 00:24:12,737
Rym: I'll put it this way, if I were running a convention... The food is decent.

416
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:14,390
Rym: It's better than PAX East food.

417
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:21,190
Rym: I would rather have it in that facility, if I could have the facility independent of the things around it, than any of the convention centers in Boston.

418
00:24:22,237 --> 00:24:22,590
Scott: Uh, sure.

419
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:22,978
Rym: Yeah.

420
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:30,710
Rym: But anyway, on Saturday, January 30th at 1pm in the Bobcat Theater, we are doing Atari game design.

421
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,128
Rym: And on Sunday...

422
00:24:32,211 --> 00:24:32,710
Scott: That's Rims idea.

423
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:37,710
Rym: January 31st at 1pm in the Bobcat Theater, the exact same time and place the next day.

424
00:24:38,631 --> 00:24:39,628
Rym: Designing game rules.

425
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:40,608
Scott: Alrighty.

426
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:41,589
Rym: It's gonna be good stuff.

427
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:47,490
Rym: I may or may not be on a third panel without Scott, because Scott doesn't care about the topic, but that is to be seen.

428
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:51,370
Rym: If that happens, it'll be Saturday after the Atari game design panel.

429
00:24:52,714 --> 00:24:53,790
Scott: I'll be playing games the rest of the time.

430
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,930
Rym: We're gonna get MAGFest between the two of us.

431
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,549
Rym: We're on like six or seven panels.

432
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:02,690
Rym: I assume PAX East, Anime Boston, PAX Prime, and then pack around.

433
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:04,870
Rym: And of course, the Patreon is still live.

434
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,769
Rym: We're getting close to our first stretch goal.

435
00:25:07,432 --> 00:25:08,129
Scott: So, uh, yeah.

436
00:25:08,392 --> 00:25:08,726
Scott: That's all you.

437
00:25:08,931 --> 00:25:09,649
Rym: Keep pushing, guys.

438
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:12,929
Rym: And submissions are open for the December Q&A.

439
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:16,110
Rym: And we already got three questions, two of which are really good questions.

440
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:17,604
Rym: And also I learned...

441
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:18,810
Scott: The third is not a good question?

442
00:25:19,016 --> 00:25:19,080
Scott: Eh.

443
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:21,009
Rym: So here's what I've learned so far.

444
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:27,430
Rym: Everyone who has asked a question has seen Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and most of them have memorized the script.

445
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:28,850
Scott: I'm just curious.

446
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:29,648
Scott: How do we know this?

447
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:30,510
Rym: 'Cause they said so.

448
00:25:30,551 --> 00:25:31,208
Rym: They might be lying.

449
00:25:31,911 --> 00:25:33,430
Rym: I put a poll question into each one of these.

450
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,388
Scott: But what nerd hasn't seen it?

451
00:25:34,572 --> 00:25:35,209
Rym: I'm curious.

452
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:38,650
Rym: And two, you know the red envelope, white envelope thing you suggested?

453
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:43,209
Rym: Literally no one who has submitted a question knows what the fuck I'm talking about.

454
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:44,461
Scott: Okay.

455
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:49,807
Rym: So that tells us that people who are our Patreon patrons either don't go to PAX's...

456
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:52,008
Scott: They don't even watch PAX on Twitch.

457
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,229
Rym: Or if they go to PAX, they don't go to the keynote and the Q&A.

458
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,187
Rym: Like, they don't know.

459
00:25:56,531 --> 00:25:56,929
Scott: They don't know.

460
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,790
Rym: Yeah, 'cause the... Or they haven't gone recently.

461
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:03,308
Rym: The poll choice I put was, "Is this a red envelope

462
00:26:03,348 --> 00:26:03,650
Rym: question?".

463
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:07,230
Rym: And the answer choices are yes, no, WTF is a red envelope question.

464
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,510
Scott: We haven't had a red envelope question.

465
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,789
Scott: It would be hard to ask one.

466
00:26:10,494 --> 00:26:11,307
Rym: Yeah, I mean, those are questions...

467
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,229
Scott: What red envelope question could you even ask me?

468
00:26:14,292 --> 00:26:15,620
Rym: I could think of ones they could ask us.

469
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:22,470
Rym: that would be pressing and stuff about family, about diseases and illness, about tragedies.

470
00:26:22,511 --> 00:26:23,070
Rym: What do you want to know?

471
00:26:23,979 --> 00:26:24,309
Rym: I don't know.

472
00:26:24,452 --> 00:26:24,970
Rym: I don't want to know.

473
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,030
Rym: I'm saying someone might have a weird...

474
00:26:26,071 --> 00:26:27,069
Scott: What does anyone want to know?

475
00:26:28,051 --> 00:26:35,609
Rym: I mean, the thing is, we don't have kids, so it's not like... A lot of people, when they ask Mike and Jerry the red envelope questions, it's always something intimate about raising your kids.

476
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,143
Scott: Right, so the answer is either, "Okay, I'll tell you," or, "Mind your own fucking

477
00:26:39,184 --> 00:26:39,509
Scott: business.".

478
00:26:40,074 --> 00:26:41,809
Scott: That's the answer, so you can't red envelope me.

479
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:45,430
Rym: You were the one who said, "We should have a red envelope, white envelope system,".

480
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:45,963
Rym: so I did it.

481
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:46,563
Rym: Yeah.

482
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:47,860
Rym: And so far, they're all.

483
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:48,890
Rym: WTF is a red envelope.

484
00:26:50,111 --> 00:27:04,969
Rym: So, at this party that I talked about before, the aforementioned party, after which we almost saw the people die in their cars hit by trains, the king of the day, other than board games, was local multiplayer games on an HTPC.

485
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:09,010
Rym: Like, that shit was rocking for the entire party without cease.

486
00:27:09,371 --> 00:27:14,627
Scott: Yes, I mean, this isn't someone who owns a X-Bone or PS4, right?

487
00:27:15,631 --> 00:27:16,409
Scott: And neither do I.

488
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,910
Rym: He has a GameCube and a Wii, but no one was playing those.

489
00:27:19,251 --> 00:27:20,289
Scott: No Wii U, right?

490
00:27:21,591 --> 00:27:24,049
Scott: Their DSs weren't coming out for whatever reason.

491
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:28,849
Rym: I asked if I was to bring my DS, but I realized that no one ever wants to play Smash with me.

492
00:27:29,251 --> 00:27:31,048
Rym: No one ever wants to play Advance Wars with me.

493
00:27:31,412 --> 00:27:33,010
Rym: No one wants to play Mario Kart with me.

494
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,839
Scott: No one wants to play Dr.

495
00:27:33,879 --> 00:27:34,668
Scott: Mario with me.

496
00:27:35,191 --> 00:27:37,428
Rym: I'll play that with you if you'll play any of those other games with me.

497
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:37,943
Rym: Yeah.

498
00:27:38,411 --> 00:27:39,547
Rym: Well, well then.

499
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:46,590
Scott: So, and, you know, all the good multiplayer-type games are Wii GameCube types for local multiplayer.

500
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:57,629
Scott: When we're limited to the selection of Steam, and these, you know, I mean, we didn't try the entire Steam library of local co-op games, but so many of the games were two-player local co-ops, so those are ruled out, you know?

501
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,769
Rym: Or local multiplayer, not necessarily co-op.

502
00:28:00,254 --> 00:28:04,830
Scott: Right, because otherwise you could play, like, Rocket League, or you could play Resident Evil.

503
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,009
Scott: Like, there's a lot of two-player co-op Resident Evils.

504
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,850
Scott: Like, I think all of them since five are local, right?

505
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:16,630
Rym: But if you have, like, if you want four people to play a game together, there's a lot of options on Steam, and most of them are not good games.

506
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:17,111
Scott: Right.

507
00:28:17,232 --> 00:28:20,090
Scott: Even if they're competitive or cooperative, it didn't really matter.

508
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:28,910
Scott: Local multiplayer games with more than two players in the Steam library were hard to come by, and when we did find them, they were often bad.

509
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:29,575
Rym: Yup.

510
00:28:29,635 --> 00:28:42,310
Rym: Now, half of them were bad because the games were bad, and half were bad because they just, like, didn't support controllers right, or the menus were incomprehensible, or just the game wouldn't go full screen, or all sorts of weird nonsense.

511
00:28:43,151 --> 00:28:45,730
Rym: But, two games stood out.

512
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:52,950
Scott: I mean, we just, opening up Long Live the Queen, and just discussing as we played was more fun than many of these actual multiplayer games.

513
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:57,810
Rym: Even though we didn't make it, I was interested to go down the road of let's be a badass swordswoman.

514
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,118
Scott: Never gone down that road before.

515
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:01,230
Scott: We failed every single test except for the one.

516
00:29:01,871 --> 00:29:02,063
Rym: Yup.

517
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:08,890
Rym: So, the one game that basically lasted about half the party, and we've already talked about it, is the Jackbox Games.

518
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,503
Rym: That is like...

519
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:10,818
Scott: We did a whole episode on them.

520
00:29:10,858 --> 00:29:11,604
Scott: They're still great.

521
00:29:11,725 --> 00:29:12,430
Scott: They're always great.

522
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,402
Rym: That is Party Game A++++.

523
00:29:16,091 --> 00:29:17,526
Scott: And everything else was not A++.

524
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:29,350
Rym: Though, I just want to point out, almost everyone who's playing the Jackbox Games was, like, super into it and loving it, but there was one person, and I won't name a name or anything, this person was playing, I think, Fibbage.

525
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:37,406
Rym: And halfway through, they were uncomfortable and did not like the game and were hoping it would end and never wanted to play it again, were really salty about playing it.

526
00:29:38,222 --> 00:29:38,370
Rym: What?

527
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,250
Rym: Which was interesting.

528
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:40,850
Scott: How could you be salty playing Fibbage?

529
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:51,790
Rym: I don't know, but there was someone who was very salty about Fibbage, and there were a couple people who I overheard got a little salty about the Drawful one because they can't draw, which is weird.

530
00:29:51,911 --> 00:29:52,709
Scott: I can't draw either.

531
00:29:53,432 --> 00:29:55,129
Rym: Not only can I not draw, I negative draw.

532
00:29:55,562 --> 00:29:55,810
Scott: Yeah.

533
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,490
Rym: And yet, that game was great, but I digress.

534
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,260
Rym: That was 50% of the play.

535
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,170
Rym: The other half was Starwall.

536
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,729
Rym: People were going crazy about this game.

537
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:11,730
Scott: Well, Starwall is a game I knew about a long time ago, mostly because, I don't know where I saw it on the internet, but I remember sending it to Rym when I discovered it.

538
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,103
Scott: Like, "Hey, Gnarwals, check this game.

539
00:30:14,304 --> 00:30:15,028
Scott: Why don't you play this

540
00:30:15,068 --> 00:30:15,330
Scott: game?".

541
00:30:15,452 --> 00:30:16,450
Scott: I didn't know anything about it.

542
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:20,890
Scott: Other than that, it was one of those indie, local multiplayer type of games.

543
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,729
Rym: It's Gnarwals plus Nidhogg.

544
00:30:23,982 --> 00:30:24,150
Scott: Yeah.

545
00:30:24,371 --> 00:30:28,290
Scott: Well, now that we played it, we finally got around to playing it at this party.

546
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:38,470
Rym: So, this game, people kept rotating in and out playing it for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours, yelling and screaming and disrupting the German board games we were trying to play.

547
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:41,569
Scott: I played it a bit, and it was fun for a bit, but then I was done with it.

548
00:30:41,871 --> 00:30:42,500
Rym: I'm not done with it.

549
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:43,069
Rym: I really like it.

550
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,249
Rym: And I kind of got good at it the more I played it.

551
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,730
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's clearly a game where you can get good at it.

552
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,107
Scott: There is some skill going on.

553
00:30:50,591 --> 00:31:10,929
Scott: But it's like the skill ramp was like... It seemed like the skill ramp wasn't a bad ramp, poorly shaped, but it said like the first bunch of steps were not steps of learning skills, but instead dealing with controls that are intentionally bad or... I actually don't think... Some combination of intentionally and accidentally bad.

554
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,870
Rym: It's interesting because I actually don't think they're bad.

555
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,190
Rym: I think they're very intuitive.

556
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:17,936
Rym: What I noticed was people who kept asking like, "How do I turn?

557
00:31:17,996 --> 00:31:18,500
Rym: How do I move?

558
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:18,782
Rym: How do I

559
00:31:18,823 --> 00:31:19,125
Rym: whatever?".

560
00:31:19,891 --> 00:31:22,890
Rym: Couldn't understand the game and wanted someone to explain how to move.

561
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:25,530
Scott: It's asteroids controls, but they're wobbly and limited.

562
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,609
Rym: Well, what it is, is that you can kind of direct your narwhal.

563
00:31:29,211 --> 00:31:30,030
Rym: Star wall, I guess.

564
00:31:30,711 --> 00:31:32,550
Rym: And you can hold A to kind of accelerate.

565
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,310
Rym: And if you wiggle your body right, you can kind of go faster.

566
00:31:35,931 --> 00:31:41,050
Rym: You've just got your sword point on the end of your narwhal, and you're trying to stab the other narwhals in the heart.

567
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,530
Scott: Right, so I didn't realize the heart part right away.

568
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,521
Scott: We didn't like study the rule.

569
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:46,770
Scott: We just started playing immediately.

570
00:31:47,353 --> 00:31:49,410
Scott: And I thought I just had to stab other narwhals.

571
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,210
Scott: I didn't realize there was this heart I had to stab.

572
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,210
Rym: I've noticed a lot of people who are bad at laser tag have the same problem.

573
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:59,389
Rym: They think, because they don't know how anything works in the world, that you just shoot the other person.

574
00:32:00,072 --> 00:32:02,650
Rym: Like, they don't realize you have to shoot that one spot on their body pack.

575
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,690
Scott: That actually can detect that they got shot, yeah.

576
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,670
Scott: Right, but this, it wasn't that I, you know, was too dumb.

577
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:08,645
Scott: It's just I didn't see it.

578
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,586
Scott: And I just lost, and I'm like, "Why did I

579
00:32:11,647 --> 00:32:11,908
Scott: lose?".

580
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:13,790
Rym: That's kind of an aside, because I noticed something.

581
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:23,130
Rym: The games where you had to look at the controls and like really think about them, or you could not play at all, tended to be the worst of the games we tried on Steam.

582
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:28,350
Rym: And the games like this where, like, you could pretty much play it okay by looking at zero rules.

583
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:32,021
Scott: I mean, as soon as someone told me about the heart, I was like, "Oh, okay, I didn't need any more rules

584
00:32:32,102 --> 00:32:32,807
Scott: explanations.".

585
00:32:33,556 --> 00:32:34,610
Scott: Yeah, the rest was intuitive.

586
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:44,489
Rym: I mean, basically, you fly around, and it's all around using the physics and dueling and trying to, like, maneuver yourself to where you can hit the narwhal in their heart without getting hit yourself.

587
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,930
Scott: With your narwhal pointy-toothed.

588
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:53,710
Rym: Yeah, which is extra interesting because your heart's only on one side of your body and you're playing in a two-dimensional space where you can kind of rotate freely.

589
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:54,271
Scott: Right.

590
00:32:54,291 --> 00:33:04,310
Scott: Now, the one thing that I found out as we played that was kind of annoying is that when you start the game, your narwhal is facing either to the left or to the right, depending on your spawn location.

591
00:33:04,871 --> 00:33:08,447
Scott: And you can never flip your narwhal to face the other way ever.

592
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:10,789
Rym: Which I think is fine.

593
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:14,090
Scott: Well, I mean, it's not necessarily good or bad.

594
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,250
Rym: The game is a four-player or a two-player game.

595
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,250
Rym: Never play this three-player.

596
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:21,450
Scott: If you play with three players, you'll have two, perhaps left-facing narwhals and one right-facing one.

597
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:27,370
Rym: But as we've talked about in the past, three-player competitive games that are not races are usually bullshit.

598
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:27,808
Rym: Right.

599
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,510
Rym: And this would have that same problem.

600
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:29,991
Scott: Right.

601
00:33:30,032 --> 00:33:34,850
Scott: But, I mean, so if it's two-on-two, though, but then you've got these different, you've got, like, three different ending situations, right?

602
00:33:34,911 --> 00:33:39,650
Scott: You've got the lefty-lefty, the righty-righty, and the mixed, you know, final confrontation between two narwhals.

603
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:50,710
Rym: But it also means... It also means that two of the narwhals favor one area of the board and two of the narwhals favor another area of the board.

604
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:50,811
Rym: Right.

605
00:33:50,831 --> 00:33:54,770
Scott: Now, the reason for this, if your narwhal was symmetrical, then it wouldn't matter.

606
00:33:54,850 --> 00:34:08,250
Scott: But your heart is on the bottom of your narwhal, which means if you flip, if you're a right-facing narwhal, that means, so you're facing to the right, you can hit people to the right, and your heart is on the ground, because there's gravity on most of the maps.

607
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:08,510
Rym: Yeah.

608
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:12,270
Scott: I mean, just relatively, that's a protected position when you're facing to the right.

609
00:34:12,672 --> 00:34:19,370
Scott: If you flip over because you want to stab someone to your left, then, suddenly, your heart is facing up and is exposed.

610
00:34:20,251 --> 00:34:23,029
Scott: So, that's why there's a righty-lefty thing going on.

611
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:24,031
Rym: Yup.

612
00:34:24,393 --> 00:34:30,327
Rym: But the thing is, you can't, well, one, I would say, I'd give strategy or talk about, like, "Oh, well, you can't just lay there because then you won't

613
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:30,549
Rym: win.".

614
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,882
Scott: Obviously, you can't just lay there.

615
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:32,590
Scott: It'd be really dumb.

616
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,989
Rym: But, the game does something very well.

617
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:41,150
Rym: It has the old Atari Ortho game thing, where there are a million different modes.

618
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:41,565
Rym: Yup.

619
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,130
Rym: And some of them are better than others.

620
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:43,810
Scott: And the maps are different.

621
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:44,231
Rym: Yup.

622
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:45,589
Rym: There's a ton of different maps.

623
00:34:46,331 --> 00:34:55,889
Rym: So, the game is always just novel enough to keep anyone who's playing it casually from getting good enough to dominate everyone else and have the air hockey problem.

624
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:56,011
Scott: Yeah.

625
00:34:56,072 --> 00:34:57,000
Scott: You can play stock.

626
00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:58,030
Scott: You can play time.

627
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:03,589
Scott: You could, like, I was getting a lot of kills, but I was losing because I was, you know, in my offensiveness, I was also taking hits.

628
00:35:03,756 --> 00:35:03,989
Scott: Yup.

629
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:10,090
Scott: And I'd be like, "The second one left alive at the end," and then I'd lose, but I had, like, most kills or second most kills.

630
00:35:10,271 --> 00:35:15,470
Scott: Well, there's a most kills mode that doesn't care how many times you die, of course, except for the fact that when you die, you're giving someone else a kill.

631
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:15,885
Scott: Yup.

632
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,190
Scott: To just distribute your deaths evenly among your opponents.

633
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:23,570
Rym: But, in hours and hours and hours of people playing, there were two people who played a lot more than everyone else.

634
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:27,670
Scott: And they did get better than everyone else, showing that there was definitely skill involved.

635
00:35:27,815 --> 00:35:27,965
Rym: Yup.

636
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,390
Scott: That could be learned and practiced.

637
00:35:30,934 --> 00:35:32,310
Rym: I like the game a lot, actually.

638
00:35:33,134 --> 00:35:38,230
Rym: And I kind of want to get it, because I think it's a good game to play idly while you're waiting for other people to come and play a game.

639
00:35:38,391 --> 00:35:45,166
Scott: I think it's an okay party game, but it's not so great that I would play it on my own, or want to play it, or...

640
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:49,170
Rym: I kind of want to play it on my own to become good enough at it to do the Nidhogg.

641
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:56,010
Scott: Sure, you can do that if you want, but... It's not strong enough to interest me, because it's just, like, the depth really isn't there.

642
00:35:56,291 --> 00:36:00,150
Rym: I think the depth is there, and you're just not going to invest in it.

643
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:00,890
Rym: It's like Smash Brothers.

644
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,070
Scott: Definitely not investing.

645
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:05,750
Rym: Are you, like, focus cancel or whatever nonsense in Smash Brothers?

646
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:13,370
Scott: No, but at least I can see, even though I'm not going to do it in either game, in Smash Brothers or those kind of games, at least I can see the depth, right?

647
00:36:13,751 --> 00:36:18,750
Scott: It's like I'm swimming in a pool, and I know I'm not diving deep, but I can see the bottom.

648
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:23,623
Scott: In this game, it's like I look down, and it's sort of dark, and I'm like, "Well, is it really shallow or deep?

649
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:24,148
Scott: I can't even

650
00:36:24,188 --> 00:36:24,370
Scott: tell.".

651
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,306
Rym: See, I can kind of see the bottom.

652
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:26,569
Scott: And I'm definitely not swimming down there.

653
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,830
Rym: I could see deeper, I think, because I definitely saw that there were very clear...

654
00:36:30,032 --> 00:36:32,409
Scott: I think I'd have to swim deeper to begin to see deeper, right?

655
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:40,708
Rym: I guess I did swim a little deeper, because I was playing it for a while again, after the first time you played, and I got kind of good, okay, pretty quick, until people started ganging up on me.

656
00:36:41,673 --> 00:36:43,289
Rym: George was getting better than he should have.

657
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:46,349
Scott: Starting to do politics in a four-player game.

658
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:50,647
Scott: See, what they really did... You know what this reminded me?

659
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:56,150
Scott: Is that the game that we really need for this situation is Video Ball.

660
00:36:57,093 --> 00:36:57,689
Scott: That's the game.

661
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:58,270
Rym: No, no, no.

662
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:09,730
Rym: The problem is, as much as I want it to be Video Ball, Video Ball is more like Rocket League, casual people sitting down to play will do nothing but own goal, get pissed, and stop.

663
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:16,590
Scott: But the one thing with Video Ball is you can do four-player local, which Rocket League can't do easily, unless you've got like four computers.

664
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:17,728
Rym: You know what I would say then?

665
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:24,270
Rym: You bust out star walls if you have the barely gamers to semi-serious gamers set at your party.

666
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:27,489
Rym: And if it's all people like me and Scott and like the front of the crew...

667
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,189
Scott: Also, Video Ball can totally work if no one is good at it.

668
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:30,758
Scott: No, no.

669
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:34,309
Scott: The same with Soul Calibur, Street Fighter work if no one's good, or Smash Brothers.

670
00:37:35,293 --> 00:37:39,910
Rym: I think Video Ball will work less good because Video Ball has a lot of own-goaling if you suck.

671
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:40,840
Scott: Maybe.

672
00:37:42,073 --> 00:37:45,090
Rym: I mean, I scored own goals, and I have some basic gaming aptitude.

673
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:46,929
Scott: Okay.

674
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,190
Rym: I mean, they serve the same purpose.

675
00:37:49,872 --> 00:37:51,170
Rym: I think they're similarly competitive.

676
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:56,289
Rym: The only real difference is that this can be a team game, but we were mostly playing it solo.

677
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:58,550
Rym: Video Ball is only a team game.

678
00:37:59,134 --> 00:38:00,490
Rym: I wouldn't play Video Ball one-on-one.

679
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,927
Rym: Just like I wouldn't play Rocket League one-on-one.

680
00:38:03,721 --> 00:38:04,990
Scott: Starwall can be four players.

681
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,090
Scott: Everyone's individual.

682
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,230
Scott: Video Ball has to be teams.

683
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,250
Scott: It's more like Mario Tennis.

684
00:38:09,611 --> 00:38:11,909
Rym: So, yeah, I was about to say, I was aiming toward that.

685
00:38:12,191 --> 00:38:20,960
Rym: Video Ball fits in the niche of Mario Tennis, and notice even in our group, it was hard to get Mario Tennis going because you needed teams to say, "We will play this game as

686
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:21,545
Rym: teams.".

687
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:23,207
Scott: Team Scott.

688
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:24,389
Rym: Starwall.

689
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,390
Rym: Team Scott.

690
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,208
Rym: What, with your boo?

691
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:27,154
Rym: Yeah.

692
00:38:29,091 --> 00:38:44,950
Rym: But, Narwhal, Starwall, can do the one-on-one-on-one-on-one where everyone plays until someone gets bored and they hand a controller over to someone else, and because only the host is going to own this game, most likely, no one's going to practice it at home and get good like they do at Smash.

693
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,090
Scott: Yeah, it'd be hard to practice.

694
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,530
Scott: Who are you going to practice Starwall against at home?

695
00:38:47,611 --> 00:38:47,758
Scott: The AI?

696
00:38:49,012 --> 00:38:55,470
Rym: So, unless your friend group, this becomes your Windjammers, it'll pretty much always be air hockey without the air hockey problem.

697
00:38:55,753 --> 00:38:55,862
Scott: Maybe.

698
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:57,170
Rym: I mean, I enjoyed it.

699
00:38:57,191 --> 00:38:57,870
Rym: I think it's a great game.

700
00:38:58,254 --> 00:38:58,930
Scott: The theme is good.

701
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:04,128
Scott: It's got that, you know, neon Geometry Wars kind of style that I like that a lot of indie games have.

702
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:04,870
Scott: It's polished.

703
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:05,869
Scott: But also, Narwhals.

704
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:06,530
Rym: It's polished.

705
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:12,830
Scott: And you can customize your Narwhal before the game starts to really stand out, and that way you can really identify who you are.

706
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:13,570
Rym: But it's polished.

707
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,650
Rym: It's consistent.

708
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:15,730
Rym: It's well-designed.

709
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:16,670
Rym: It has good aesthetics.

710
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,050
Rym: It plays easily.

711
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,270
Rym: It's intuitive to the most.

712
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,429
Scott: Controls might be a little flaky.

713
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:22,110
Rym: I don't think they're flaky at all.

714
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:23,949
Rym: I don't think they're flaky.

715
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,130
Rym: They're very consistent.

716
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,648
Scott: They're consistently not perfect.

717
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:27,247
Rym: No, no.

718
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:31,849
Rym: Flaky would be like some of those mediocre platformers where they don't work.

719
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,189
Scott: Yeah, it's not that bad.

720
00:39:33,531 --> 00:39:35,609
Scott: It's not one of those ones where you're just like, "Fuck this.

721
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,304
Scott: The controls are so

722
00:39:36,345 --> 00:39:36,509
Scott: bad.".

723
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,542
Scott: They're just slightly like,

724
00:39:37,704 --> 00:39:37,805
Scott: "Eh.".

725
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:39,110
Rym: I don't think they're eh.

726
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,070
Rym: I think they're actually really good.

727
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:40,443
Rym: They're eh.

728
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,930
Rym: I felt like I had a lot of control on my Starwall.

729
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:44,928
Scott: Not really.

730
00:39:45,512 --> 00:39:46,386
Rym: Let's play some one-on-one.

731
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,830
Rym: I think something might have it.

732
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,409
Rym: I think I might just be way better at this game than you.

733
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:50,230
Scott: Possibly.

734
00:39:51,511 --> 00:39:54,590
Scott: But the theme of it being also Narwhals in space.

735
00:39:54,852 --> 00:39:56,750
Rym: But it also, it did everything.

736
00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:12,730
Rym: If you want to be this directly competitive single screen local, or you could do this game online just as easily, but single screen orthogame in the style of old Atari competitive games, this game did that to a T. Because, I mean, those games aren't all great.

737
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:16,450
Rym: As long as you do the formula well, you'll succeed and you'll be a niche like Slot Racers.

738
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:19,650
Scott: All right, so we have to talk about Res Publica because you put it in the title of the episode.

739
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:22,809
Rym: Res Publica is a Knizia game that I had never played until PAX.

740
00:40:23,536 --> 00:40:24,890
Scott: I had never played it until this weekend.

741
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:25,908
Rym: Yeah, Chris busts it out.

742
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,710
Scott: I played it once and that's all I need to play.

743
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:35,599
Rym: I like it because the only game I can think of that has a mechanic even close to this, in terms of the mechanic.

744
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,809
Rym: that's interesting in this game, is Hanabi.

745
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:40,150
Scott: Yeah, but Hanabi is better by a lot.

746
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:45,330
Rym: This is a game where there's two resources and you're trying to build the most stuff by making sets of dudes.

747
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,250
Scott: Right, there's two decks of cards.

748
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:54,230
Scott: You have to make sets and succeed in the first deck of cards and you can start getting cards from the second deck and the second deck is actually worth victory points.

749
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:59,010
Scott: So it's pretty much build a machine and then score and then the game's over.

750
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:05,409
Rym: But the mechanic, and this is all I want to focus on, the game itself, play it if you're a game designer and you want to see how this works.

751
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:10,026
Scott: It's really straightforward and simple and not really the greatest, but...

752
00:41:10,572 --> 00:41:11,167
Rym: Well, it could be.

753
00:41:13,057 --> 00:41:19,570
Scott: It's really just, here's this game mechanic, let's implement it in the simplest possible, most straightforward way and the end.

754
00:41:19,731 --> 00:41:25,010
Rym: But the mechanic is such, so think about games like Bonanza, about games like Hanabi.

755
00:41:25,293 --> 00:41:26,710
Scott: I think Bonanza does it better, Hanabi does it better.

756
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,510
Rym: No, I think Bonanza does it worse, but Bonanza's a more fun game.

757
00:41:30,116 --> 00:41:30,390
Scott: Maybe.

758
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:34,470
Rym: Because there's no information economy in Bonanza, really, not like the strict one here.

759
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,207
Scott: That's true, in Bonanza you could just be like, "Yeah, I got ten cool

760
00:41:36,228 --> 00:41:36,330
Scott: green.".

761
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:40,290
Rym: In fact, imagine Bonanza if you used some of the ideas from this game.

762
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:40,567
Rym: Maybe.

763
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:42,310
Rym: Anyway, so here's the mechanic.

764
00:41:42,492 --> 00:41:49,545
Rym: On your turn, you'll have a hand of cards and you either say, "I have something," or, "I want

765
00:41:49,726 --> 00:41:50,090
Rym: something.".

766
00:41:51,332 --> 00:41:53,710
Scott: So in saying that, you're giving information away.

767
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:55,790
Scott: Obviously, if you say you have something, you have to have it.

768
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:57,389
Scott: You can't say you have something you don't have.

769
00:41:57,911 --> 00:42:01,350
Scott: And if you say you want something, well, that's the only thing that you could get.

770
00:42:01,851 --> 00:42:07,470
Scott: So clearly, you must have something that goes with the thing you want in your hand, otherwise you wouldn't be saying that.

771
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:08,670
Rym: So I offer a contract.

772
00:42:09,091 --> 00:42:11,250
Rym: I have two Langebaarden.

773
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:14,629
Rym: That means I will give you two Langebaarden for whatever you offer.

774
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,730
Scott: Right, so you go around the table.

775
00:42:16,811 --> 00:42:22,730
Scott: So since Rym started with an "I have," everyone else has to reply with an "I have," right?

776
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,729
Scott: So Rym said he has two Langebaarden.

777
00:42:25,451 --> 00:42:26,381
Scott: I have two Schiffbau.

778
00:42:28,873 --> 00:42:30,650
Rym: And everyone else says, "I have one Schiffbau.

779
00:42:30,911 --> 00:42:31,861
Rym: I have three

780
00:42:32,326 --> 00:42:32,730
Rym: cards.".

781
00:42:33,516 --> 00:42:33,730
Scott: Yup.

782
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:34,948
Rym: And who cares what they are?

783
00:42:35,235 --> 00:42:35,407
Scott: Yup.

784
00:42:35,891 --> 00:42:40,549
Rym: And you go around, and then I can choose not to trade, or I can pick one of those deals and do it.

785
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:46,490
Scott: So if he picks me, he has to give me two Langebaarden and I have to give him two Schiffbau, because that's what we said that we had.

786
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:49,370
Rym: Oh yeah, the copy of the game we have is just in German.

787
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:50,889
Scott: We can't negotiate, right?

788
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:52,890
Scott: We have to do what we said was the thing.

789
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:55,230
Rym: Yeah, it's a very structured market.

790
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:59,428
Rym: So if I say, "I want," then Scott would say, "I

791
00:42:59,488 --> 00:42:59,830
Rym: want.".

792
00:42:59,951 --> 00:43:02,324
Scott: Yeah, you have to reply to a "want" with a "want" and a "have" with a

793
00:43:02,345 --> 00:43:02,570
Scott: "have.".

794
00:43:02,631 --> 00:43:06,570
Scott: So if he says he wants a Schiffbau, I have to, A, have to have a Schiffbau.

795
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:09,947
Scott: I can't say I want something if I don't have the Schiffbau that he wants.

796
00:43:10,551 --> 00:43:17,990
Rym: So to step it up a little further, you can have up to two clauses and an "and" or an "or" between them.

797
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:22,084
Rym: So I could say, "I want two Schiffbau or two

798
00:43:22,726 --> 00:43:23,409
Rym: Langebaarden.".

799
00:43:24,072 --> 00:43:29,590
Scott: So that means I can reply with a "want" as long as I have either two Schiffbau or two Langebaarden.

800
00:43:30,391 --> 00:43:32,043
Scott: And then I would say, "I want

801
00:43:32,264 --> 00:43:32,667
Scott: something.".

802
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:39,570
Scott: So now, if we actually, Rym chooses me for the deal, it's up to me whether to give him the Schiffbaus or the Langebaarden.

803
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:43,570
Scott: Because I said "or," I decide which of those "ors" I'm going to give.

804
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:47,510
Rym: Yeah, so if I say, "I have X or Y," fuck you.

805
00:43:48,173 --> 00:43:49,690
Rym: You don't get to pick which one.

806
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:56,250
Rym: So "I have or" is kind of a dick deal, but you can use that to share information.

807
00:43:56,290 --> 00:44:01,649
Scott: Something I thought about immediately after playing that I never did during the game was, could I lie using an "or"?

808
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:03,629
Scott: For example, I have one Schiffbau in my hand.

809
00:44:04,071 --> 00:44:12,410
Scott: Could I say, "I have one Schiffbau or one something I don't have," and then always give the Schiffbau?

810
00:44:12,952 --> 00:44:13,759
Rym: No, you cannot.

811
00:44:13,779 --> 00:44:15,029
Rym: I'm reasonably sure.

812
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:17,348
Rym: No one did that because I don't think you can.

813
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:22,864
Scott: Because when I give him, if you give someone something after an "or," you give it to them.

814
00:44:22,905 --> 00:44:27,749
Scott: face down so that only you and they know what you actually gave and no one else does.

815
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:28,448
Rym: So think about this.

816
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:33,487
Rym: When I'm saying my "haves" and "wants," I might have a part of the clause.

817
00:44:33,507 --> 00:44:36,530
Rym: that is something I actually want to do, but I'm also trying to share information.

818
00:44:36,714 --> 00:44:37,470
Rym: I'm trying to impart.

819
00:44:38,131 --> 00:44:50,149
Rym: Say it's my turn and I offer something to Scott, I might also be saying something because I want Chris to offer me something on his turn, and I'm trying to share information without saying too much information.

820
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:51,730
Scott: Right, you're negotiating without directly negotiating.

821
00:44:51,950 --> 00:45:03,464
Scott: By saying that you want something, someone just said they have one something and it goes around and no one has anything, and then you're like, "I want two of that something you just said you had one

822
00:45:03,626 --> 00:45:03,667
Scott: of.".

823
00:45:04,055 --> 00:45:04,345
Scott: Yep.

824
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:04,999
Scott: Yeah.

825
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:15,249
Rym: But you've got to be careful because if you share too much information, like if Scott keeps talking about how he has Langobarden, he's trying to get rid of him, and then suddenly he says, "I--" Can you look up some more of the cards that say Langobarden and Schiffvowels?

826
00:45:16,191 --> 00:45:16,530
Rym: Vickenger?

827
00:45:16,751 --> 00:45:17,408
Scott: Anglo-Saxons.

828
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:18,729
Rym: Anglo-Saxons and Vickengers?

829
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:19,988
Scott: Vickengers, okay, there we go.

830
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:22,225
Rym: Schiffvowel.

831
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:22,889
Scott: Schiffvowel.

832
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:27,715
Rym: But if Scott keeps saying, "I have Langobarden, I have Langobarden," then suddenly he's like, "I want

833
00:45:27,755 --> 00:45:28,262
Rym: Langobarden?".

834
00:45:28,931 --> 00:45:33,029
Rym: Well, yeah, no one's going to give him fucking Langobarden now because he's going to make his set.

835
00:45:33,532 --> 00:45:36,970
Rym: He suddenly got by luck close enough to be there to his set.

836
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:48,770
Rym: So the game is a pretty rough game if you really play to win because you've got to keep track of what people have and want based on these negotiated contracts and this information economy.

837
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:52,550
Rym: It was too much for me to ever bother trying to do fully.

838
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:59,567
Scott: Yeah, I'm like, at the beginning of the game, I started to get a picture in my head of what were in people's hands, and before it got around to table one, so I gave the fuck up.

839
00:46:00,072 --> 00:46:02,630
Rym: So, information economy games.

840
00:46:03,091 --> 00:46:08,309
Scott: I would say, if you're just a casual gamer-- I ended up just sort of associating one card with each player at any given turn.

841
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:09,623
Rym: Well, it's like in T&E.

842
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:14,169
Rym: All I think about is, for everyone else, what do they have the least of?

843
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:16,309
Rym: And I try to keep track of that, and I ignore everything else.

844
00:46:16,611 --> 00:46:18,189
Scott: They have the least of the thing no one has any of.

845
00:46:19,531 --> 00:46:23,110
Rym: So, do not get this game just as a general gamer.

846
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:28,785
Rym: I'd honestly only recommend it if, one, you're a Rainier Canisia fan, like you really just want to go through his works.

847
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:33,130
Scott: Or if you're a game designer and you want to study this mechanic.

848
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:44,069
Rym: Yes, if you're a game designer who is interested in information economies, because there aren't that many games that do it well, and I suspect information-- Or if you're some sort of game researcher or something.

849
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:51,390
Rym: Yeah, information economy games are rare, and they might be a way to solve some of the problems of shitty co-op games like Pandemic.

850
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:58,610
Scott: Right, but yeah, there's a lot you can learn from this game, but there's not a lot of fun that normal people could have playing this game, or anyone could have playing this game.

851
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:01,150
Scott: It's like, I played it once, and I don't need to play it again, really.

852
00:47:01,495 --> 00:47:02,370
Scott: I understand it now.

853
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:10,910
Rym: So the third type of person to play it is, if you're one of those people who has played every game, this is novel, and you'll get pure novelty from it, because you haven't played a game like it before.

854
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:11,508
Scott: Yeah, a few times.

855
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:11,920
Scott: Yeah.

856
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:18,559
Rym: I mean, some people have played most of the games in the PAX library, and you're sitting there like, "Eh, what do I play?

857
00:47:18,579 --> 00:47:19,405
Rym: that isn't Tiggers and

858
00:47:19,485 --> 00:47:19,929
Rym: Euphrates?".

859
00:47:26,272 --> 00:47:28,390
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

860
00:47:28,551 --> 00:47:33,530
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

861
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:38,950
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

862
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:41,870
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

863
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:46,589
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

864
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:50,146
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

865
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:54,450
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

866
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:57,570
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

867
00:48:18,343 --> 00:49:04,320
Rym: And the Patrons this week are... The only really important thing I can tell you guys is if you didn't notice, the poll for the December Q&A episode is up.

868
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,599
Rym: You can go vote in that now, submit your questions.

869
00:49:07,241 --> 00:49:16,620
Rym: And the November Q&A is already up, so if you haven't logged in to Patreon in a while, make sure you log in because everyone who's giving us any amount of money can listen to that episode.

870
00:49:17,226 --> 00:49:18,460
Rym: And we talk about some pretty good stuff.

871
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,480
Rym: It was actually a full-on real episode.

872
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,160
Rym: So stay tuned for new stuff.

873
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:25,420
Rym: A lot of things are in pre-production, and you heard about all the panels we're doing.

874
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,380
Rym: And now I leave you with your moment of literally the opposite of zen.

875
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:32,691
Scott: Can you be mincemeat?

876
00:49:32,751 --> 00:49:34,033
Rym: fine not to touch anything?

877
00:49:40,503 --> 00:49:41,940
Scott: All right, I guess I wasn't thinking.

878
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,280
Scott: You weren't thinking?

879
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:47,899
Rym: You mean you'll work on engines and machinery and not thinking your own personal safety?

880
00:49:49,663 --> 00:49:50,557
Rym: Here, here.

881
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,338
Scott: Shake hands with danger.

882
00:49:54,667 --> 00:49:56,160
Scott: Shake hands with danger.

883
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,560
Rym: Shake hands with danger.

884
00:50:15,092 --> 00:50:16,349
Rym: Shake hands with danger.

885
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,508
Rym: Be the guy who ought to know.

886
00:50:19,912 --> 00:50:21,290
Rym: I used to laugh at safety.

887
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:22,784
Scott: Now they call me.

888
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:25,128
Rym: Three-finger Joe.

889
00:50:40,961 --> 00:50:41,212
Rym: Danger.

890
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:53,155
Rym: Danger, danger.

891
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:58,839
Rym: Danger, danger.

892
00:51:03,111 --> 00:51:06,925
Rym: Danger, danger, danger, danger, danger, danger, danger, danger.

893
00:51:22,341 --> 00:51:23,698
Rym: Shake hands with danger.

894
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:26,400
Rym: Find it anywhere you choose.

895
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,660
Rym: Be careless for a moment.

896
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,619
Rym: Spend a lifetime with the blues.

897
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:36,180
Rym: Glenn knows the risk of striking hard against badly chipped metal.

898
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:41,939
Rym: But he's wearing safety glasses, and there's a macho thing involved here.

899
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:47,140
Rym: Glenn doesn't want his friends to stare at him for being overly cautious.

900
00:51:48,362 --> 00:51:51,600
Rym: So, Glenn shakes hands with danger.
